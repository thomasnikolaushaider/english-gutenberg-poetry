    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">To The Present Edition ,</p>
    <p n="2">With Some Account Of The Translator .</p>
    <p n="3">The first edition of this translation of La Fontaine 's Fables appeared in Boston , U. S ., in 1841 . It achieved a considerable success , and six editions were printed in three years . Since then it has been allowed to pass out of print , except in the shape of a small-type edition produced in London immediately after the first publication in Boston , and the present publishers have thought that a reprint in a readable yet popular form would be generally acceptable .</p>
    <p n="4">The translator has remarked , in the “ Advertisement ” to his original edition ( which follows these pages ) , on the singular neglect of La Fontaine by English translators up to the time of his own work . Forty years have elapsed since those remarks were penned , yet translations into English of the complete Fables of the chief among modern fabulists are almost as few in number as they were then . Mr. George Ticknor ( the author of the “ History of Spanish Literature , ” &amp; c .) , in praising Mr. Wright 's translation when it first appeared , said La Fontaine 's was “ a book till now untranslated ; ” and since Mr. Wright so happily accomplished his self-imposed task , there has been but one other complete translation , viz ., that of the late Mr. Walter Thornbury . This latter , however , seems to have been undertaken chiefly with a view to supplying the necessary accompaniment to the English issue of M. Doré 's well-known designs for the Fables ( first published as illustrations to a Paris edition ) , and existing as it does only in the large quarto form given to those illustrations , it cannot make any claim to be a handy-volume edition . Mr. Wright 's translation , however , still holds its place as the best English version , and the present reprint , besides having undergone careful revision , embodies the corrections ( but not the expurgations ) of the sixth edition , which differed from those preceding it . The notes too , have , for the most part , been added by the reviser .</p>
    <p n="5">Some account of the translator , who is still one of the living notables of his nation , may not be out of place here . Elizur Wright , junior , is the son of Elizur Wright , who published some papers in mathematics , but was principally engaged in agricultural pursuits at Canaan , Litchfield Co ., Connecticut , U. S . The younger Elizur Wright was born at Canaan in 1804 . He graduated at Yale College in 1826 , and afterwards taught in a school at Groton . In 1829 , he became Professor of Mathematics in Hudson College , from which post he went to New York in 1833 , on being appointed secretary to the American Anti-Slavery Society . In 1838 he removed to the literary centre of the United States , Boston , where he edited several papers successively , and where he published his “ La Fontaine ; ” which thus , whilst , it still remains his most considerable work , was also one of his earliest . How he was led to undertake it , he has himself narrated in the advertisement to his first edition . But previously to 1841 , the date of the first publication of the complete “ Fables , ” he tried the effect of a partial publication . In 1839 he published , anonymously , a little 12mo volume , “ La Fontaine ; A Present for the Young . ” This , as appears from the title , was a book for children , and though the substance of these few ( and simpler ) fables may be traced in the later and complete edition , the latter shows a considerable improvement upon the work of his “ ‘ prentice hand . ” The complete work was published , as we have said , in 1841 . It appeared in an expensive and sumptuous form , and was adorned with the French artist Grandville 's illustrations — which had first appeared only two years previously in the Paris edition of La Fontaine 's Fables , published by Fournier Ainé . The book was well received both in America and England , and four other editions were speedily called for . The sixth edition , published in 1843 , was a slightly expurgated one , designed for schools . The expurgation , however , almost wholly consisted of the omission bodily of five of the fables , whose places were , as Mr. Wright stated in his preface , filled by six original fables of his own . From his “ Notice ” affixed to this sixth edition , it seems evident that he by no means relished the task , usually a hateful one , of expurgating his author . Having , however , been urged to the task by “ criticisms both friendly and unfriendly ” ( as he says ) he did it ; and did it wisely , because sparingly . But in his prefatory words he in a measure protests . He says :— “ In this age , distinguished for almost everything more than sincerity , there are some people who would seem too delicate and refined to read their Bibles . ” And he concludes with the appeal ,— “ But the unsophisticated lovers of nature , who have not had the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the French language , I have no doubt will thank me for interpreting to them these honest and truthful fictions of the frank old JEAN , and will beg me to proceed no farther in the work of expurgation . ” The first of the substituted fables of the sixth edition — The Fly and the Game , given below — may also be viewed as a protest to the same purpose . As a specimen of Mr. Wright 's powers at once as an original poet and an original fabulist , we here print ( for the first time in England , we believe ) the substituted fables of his sixth edition . We may add , that they appeared in lieu of the following five fables as given in Mr. Wright 's complete edition — and in the present edition :— The Bitch and her Friend , The Mountain in Labour , The Young Widow , The Women and the Secret , and , The Husband , the Wife , and the Thief . It should also be borne in mind that these original fables were inserted in an edition professedly meant for schools rather than for the general public .</p>
    <p n="6">THE FLY AND THE GAME .</p>

   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>A knight of powder-horn and shot Once fill 'd his bag — as I would not , Unless the feelings of my breast By poverty were sorely press 'd — With birds and squirrels for the spits Of certain gormandizing cits . With merry heart the fellow went Direct to Mr. Centpercent , Who loved , as well was understood , Whatever game was nice and good . This gentleman , with knowing air , Survey 'd the dainty lot with care , Pronounced it racy , rich , and rare , And call 'd his wife , to know her wishes About its purchase for their dishes . The lady thought the creatures prime , And for their dinner just in time ; So sweet they were , and delicate , For dinner she could hardly wait . But now there came — could luck be worse ?— Just as the buyer drew his purse , A bulky fly , with solemn buzz , And smelt , as an inspector does , This bird and that , and said the meat — But here his words I wo n't repeat — Was anything but fit to eat . ‘ Ah ! ’ cried the lady , ‘ there 's a fly I never knew to tell a lie ; His coat , you see , is bottle-green ; He knows a thing or two I ween ; My dear , I beg you , do not buy : Such game as this may suit the dogs . ’ So on our peddling sportsman jogs , His soul possess 'd of this surmise , About some men , as well as flies : A filthy taint they soonest find Who are to relish filth inclined .</docImprint>

    <head>THE DOG AND CAT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A dog and cat , messmates for life ,</l>
     <l n="2">Were often falling into strife ,</l>
     <l n="3">Which came to scratching , growls , and snaps ,</l>
     <l n="4">And spitting in the face , perhaps .</l>
     <l n="5">A neighbour dog once chanced to call</l>
     <l n="6">Just at the outset of their brawl ,</l>
     <l n="7">And , thinking Tray was cross and cruel ,</l>
     <l n="8">To snarl so sharp at Mrs. Mew-well ,</l>
     <l n="9">Growl 'd rather roughly in his ear .</l>
     <l n="10">‘ And who are you to interfere ? ’</l>
     <l n="11">Exclaim 'd the cat , while in his face she flew ;</l>
     <l n="12">And , as was wise , he suddenly withdrew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">It seems , in spite of all his snarling ,</l>
     <l n="14">And hers , that Tray was still her darling .</l>

    <head>THE GOLDEN PITCHER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A father once , whose sons were two ,</l>
     <l n="2">For each a gift had much ado .</l>
     <l n="3">At last upon this course he fell :</l>
     <l n="4">‘ My sons , ’ said he , ‘ within our well</l>
     <l n="5">Two treasures lodge , as I am told ;</l>
     <l n="6">The one a sunken piece of gold ,—</l>
     <l n="7">A bowl it may be , or a pitcher ,—</l>
     <l n="8">The other is a thing far richer .</l>
     <l n="9">These treasures if you can but find ,</l>
     <l n="10">Each may be suited to his mind ;</l>
     <l n="11">For both are precious in their kind .</l>
     <l n="12">To gain the one you 'll need a hook ;</l>
     <l n="13">The other will but cost a look .</l>
     <l n="14">But O , of this , I pray , beware !—</l>
     <l n="15">You who may choose the tempting share ,—</l>
     <l n="16">Too eager fishing for the pitcher</l>
     <l n="17">May ruin that which is far richer . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="18">Out ran the boys , their gifts to draw :</l>
     <l n="19">But eagerness was check 'd with awe ,</l>
     <l n="20">How could there be a richer prize</l>
     <l n="21">Than solid gold beneath the skies ?</l>
     <l n="22">Or , if there could , how could it dwell</l>
     <l n="23">Within their own old , mossy well ?</l>
     <l n="24">Were questions which excited wonder ,</l>
     <l n="25">And kept their headlong av'rice under .</l>
     <l n="26">The golden cup each fear 'd to choose ,</l>
     <l n="27">Lest he the better gift should lose ;</l>
     <l n="28">And so resolved our prudent pair ,</l>
     <l n="29">The gifts in common they would share .</l>
     <l n="30">The well was open to the sky .</l>
     <l n="31">As o'er its curb they keenly pry ,</l>
     <l n="32">It seems a tunnel piercing through ,</l>
     <l n="33">From sky to sky , from blue to blue ;</l>
     <l n="34">And , at its nether mouth , each sees</l>
     <l n="35">A brace of their antipodes ,</l>
     <l n="36">With earnest faces peering up ,</l>
     <l n="37">As if themselves might seek the cup .</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Ha ! ’ said the elder , with a laugh ,</l>
     <l n="39">‘ We need not share it by the half .</l>
     <l n="40">The mystery is clear to me ;</l>
     <l n="41">That richer gift to all is free .</l>
     <l n="42">Be only as that water true ,</l>
     <l n="43">And then the whole belongs to you . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="44">That truth itself was worth so much ,</l>
     <l n="45">It cannot be supposed that such .</l>
     <l n="46">A pair of lads were satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="47">And yet they were before they died .</l>
     <l n="48">But whether they fish 'd up the gold</l>
     <l n="49">I 'm sure I never have been told .</l>
     <l n="50">Thus much they learn 'd , I take for granted ,—</l>
     <l n="51">And that was what their father wanted :—</l>
     <l n="52">If truth for wealth we sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="53">We throw away the richer prize .</l>

    <head>PARTY STRIFE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Among the beasts a feud arose .</l>
     <l n="2">The lion , as the story goes ,</l>
     <l n="3">Once on a time laid down</l>
     <l n="4">His sceptre and his crown ;</l>
     <l n="5">And in his stead the beasts elected ,</l>
     <l n="6">As often as it suited them ,</l>
     <l n="7">A sort of king pro tem .,—</l>
     <l n="8">Some animal they much respected .</l>
     <l n="9">At first they all concurr 'd .</l>
     <l n="10">The horse , the stag , the unicorn ,</l>
     <l n="11">Were chosen each in turn ;</l>
     <l n="12">And then the noble bird</l>
     <l n="13">That looks undazzled at the sun .</l>
     <l n="14">But party strife began to run</l>
     <l n="15">Through burrow , den , and herd .</l>
     <l n="16">Some beasts proposed the patient ox ,</l>
     <l n="17">And others named the cunning fox .</l>
     <l n="18">The quarrel came to bites and knocks ;</l>
     <l n="19">Nor was it duly settled</l>
     <l n="20">Till many a beast high-mettled</l>
     <l n="21">Had bought an aching head ,</l>
     <l n="22">Or , possibly , had bled .</l>
     <l n="23">The fox , as one might well suppose ,</l>
     <l n="24">At last above his rival rose ,</l>
     <l n="25">But , truth to say , his reign was bootless ,</l>
     <l n="26">Of honour being rather fruitless .</l>
     <l n="27">All prudent beasts began to see</l>
     <l n="28">The throne a certain charm had lost ,</l>
     <l n="29">And , won by strife , as it must be ,</l>
     <l n="30">Was hardly worth the pains it cost .</l>
     <l n="31">So when his majesty retired ,</l>
     <l n="32">Few worthy beasts his seat desired .</l>
     <l n="33">Especially now stood aloof</l>
     <l n="34">The wise of head , the swift of hoof ,</l>
     <l n="35">The beasts whose breasts were battle-proof .</l>
     <l n="36">It consequently came to pass ,</l>
     <l n="37">Not first , but , as we say , in fine ,</l>
     <l n="38">For king the creatures chose the ass —</l>
     <l n="39">He , for prime minister the swine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="40">‘ Tis thus that party spirit</l>
     <l n="41">Is prone to banish merit .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE CAT AND THE THRUSH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A thrush that sang one rustic ode</l>
     <l n="2">Once made a garden his abode ,</l>
     <l n="3">And gave the owner such delight ,</l>
     <l n="4">He grew a special favourite .</l>
     <l n="5">Indeed , his landlord did his best</l>
     <l n="6">To make him safe from every foe ;</l>
     <l n="7">The ground about his lowly nest</l>
     <l n="8">Was undisturb 'd by spade or hoe .</l>
     <l n="9">And yet his song was still the same ;</l>
     <l n="10">It even grew somewhat more tame .</l>
     <l n="11">At length Grimalkin spied the pet ,</l>
     <l n="12">Resolved that he should suffer yet ,</l>
     <l n="13">And laid his plan of devastation</l>
     <l n="14">So as to save his reputation ;</l>
     <l n="15">For , in the house , from looks demure ,</l>
     <l n="16">He pass 'd for honest , kind , and pure .</l>
     <l n="17">Professing search of mice and moles ,</l>
     <l n="18">He through the garden daily strolls ,</l>
     <l n="19">And never seeks our thrush to catch ;</l>
     <l n="20">But when his consort comes to hatch ,</l>
     <l n="21">Just eats the young ones in a batch .</l>
     <l n="22">The sadness of the pair bereaved</l>
     <l n="23">Their generous guardian sorely grieved .</l>
     <l n="24">But yet it could not be believed</l>
     <l n="25">His faithful cat was in the wrong ,</l>
     <l n="26">Though so the thrush said in his song .</l>
     <l n="27">The cat was therefore favour 'd still</l>
     <l n="28">To walk the garden at his will ;</l>
     <l n="29">And hence the birds , to shun the pest ,</l>
     <l n="30">Upon a pear-tree built their nest .</l>
     <l n="31">Though there it cost them vastly more ,</l>
     <l n="32">‘ Twas vastly better than before .</l>
     <l n="33">And Gaffer Thrush directly found</l>
     <l n="34">His throat , when raised above the ground ,</l>
     <l n="35">Gave forth a softer , sweeter sound .</l>
     <l n="36">New tunes , moreover , he had caught ,</l>
     <l n="37">By perils and afflictions taught ,</l>
     <l n="38">And found new things to sing about :</l>
     <l n="39">New scenes had brought new talents out .</l>
     <l n="40">So , while , improved beyond a doubt ,</l>
     <l n="41">His own old song more clearly rang ,</l>
     <l n="42">Far better than themselves he sang</l>
     <l n="43">The chants and trills of other birds ;</l>
     <l n="44">He even mock 'd Grimalkin 's words</l>
     <l n="45">With such delightful humour that</l>
     <l n="46">He gain 'd the Christian name of Cat .</l>

     <l n="50">As much indebted to its foes .</l>

   <p>In 1844 Mr. Wright wrote the Preface to the first collected edition of the works of the poet J. G. Whittier ; and soon after he seems to have become completely absorbed in politics , and in the mighty anti-slavery struggle , which constituted the greater part of the politics of the United States in those and many succeeding years . He became a journalist in the anti-slavery cause ; and , in 1850 , he wrote a trenchant answer to Mr. Carlyle 's then just published “ Latter Day Pamphlets . ” Later on , slavery having been at length abolished , he appeared as a writer in yet another field , publishing several works , one as lately as 1877 , on life-assurance .</p>

   <p>Four years ago , I dropped into Charles de Behr 's repository of foreign books , in Broadway , New York , and there , for the first time , saw La Fontaine 's Fables . It was a cheap copy , adorned with some two hundred woodcuts , which , by their worn appearance , betokened an extensive manufacture . I became a purchaser , and gave the book to my little boy , then just beginning to feel the intellectual magnetism of pictures . In the course of the next year , he frequently tasked my imperfect knowledge of French for the story which belonged to some favourite vignette . This led me to inquire whether any English version existed ; and , not finding any , I resolved , though quite unused to literary exercises of the sort , to cheat sleep of an hour every morning till there should be one . The result is before you . If in this I have wronged La Fontaine , I hope the best-natured of poets , as well as yourselves , will forgive me , and lay the blame on the better qualified , who have so long neglected the task . Cowper should have done it . The author of “ John Gilpin , ” and the “ Retired Cat , ” would have put La Fontaine into every chimney-corner which resounds with the Anglo-Saxon tongue .... To you who have so generously enabled me to publish this work with so great advantages , and without selling the copyright for the promise of a song , I return my heartfelt thanks . A hatchet-faced , spectacled , threadbare stranger knocked at your doors , with a prospectus , unbacked by “ the trade , ” soliciting your subscription to a costly edition of a mere translation . It is a most inglorious , unsatisfactory species of literature . The slightest preponderance of that worldly wisdom which never buys a pig-in-a-poke would have sent him and his translation packing . But a kind faith in your species got the better in your case . You not only gave the hungry-looking stranger your good wishes , but your good names . A list of those names it would delight me to insert ; and I should certainly do it if I felt authorized . As it is , I hope to be pardoned for mentioning some of the individuals , who have not only given their names , but expressed an interest in my enterprise which has assisted me in its accomplishment . Rev . John Pierpont , Prof. George Ticknor , Prof. Henry W. Longfellow , William H. Prescott , Esq ., Hon . Theodore Lyman , Prof. Silliman , Prof. Denison Olmsted , Chancellor Kent , William C. Bryant , Esq ., Dr. J. W. Francis , Hon . Peter A. Jay , Hon . Luther Bradish , and Prof. J. Molinard , have special claims to my gratitude ....</p>
   <p>The work — as it is , not as it ought to be — I commit to your kindness . I do not claim to have succeeded in translating “ the inimitable La Fontaine , ” — perhaps I have not even a right to say in his own language —</p>
   <p>“ J'ai du moins ouvert le chemin . ”</p>
   <p>However this may be , I am , gratefully ,</p>
   <p>Your obedient servant ,</p>

   <p>Human nature , when fresh from the hand of God , was full of poetry . Its sociality could not be pent within the bounds of the actual . To the lower inhabitants of air , earth , and water ,— and even to those elements themselves , in all their parts and forms ,— it gave speech and reason . The skies it peopled with beings , on the noblest model of which it could have any conception — to wit , its own . The intercourse of these beings , thus created and endowed ,— from the deity kindled into immortality by the imagination , to the clod personified for the moment ,— gratified one of its strongest propensities ; for man may well enough be defined as the historical animal . The faculty which , in after ages , was to chronicle the realities developed by time , had at first no employment but to place on record the productions of the imagination . Hence , fable blossomed and ripened in the remotest antiquity . We see it mingling itself with the primeval history of all nations . It is not improbable that many of the narratives which have been preserved for us , by the bark or parchment of the first rude histories , as serious matters of fact , were originally apologues , or parables , invented to give power and wings to moral lessons , and afterwards modified , in their passage from mouth to mouth , by the well-known magic of credulity . The most ancient poets graced their productions with apologues . Hesiod 's fable of the Hawk and the Nightingale is an instance . The fable or parable was anciently , as it is even now , a favourite weapon of the most successful orators . When Jotham would show the Shechemites the folly of their ingratitude , he uttered the fable of the Fig-Tree , the Olive , the Vine , and the Bramble . When the prophet Nathan would oblige David to pass a sentence of condemnation upon himself in the matter of Uriah , he brought before him the apologue of the rich man who , having many sheep , took away that of the poor man who had but one . When Joash , the king of Israel , would rebuke the vanity of Amaziah , the king of Judah , he referred him to the fable of the Thistle and the Cedar . Our blessed Saviour , the best of all teachers , was remarkable for his constant use of parables , which are but fables — we speak it with reverence — adapted to the gravity of the subjects on which he discoursed . And , in profane history , we read that Stesichorus put the Himerians on their guard against the tyranny of Phalaris by the fable of the Horse and the Stag . Cyrus , for the instruction of kings , told the story of the fisher obliged to use his nets to take the fish that turned a deaf ear to the sound of his flute . Menenius Agrippa , wishing to bring back the mutinous Roman people from Mount Sacer , ended his harangue with the fable of the Belly and the Members . A Ligurian , in order to dissuade King Comanus from yielding to the Phocians a portion of his territory as the site of Marseilles , introduced into his discourse the story of the bitch that borrowed a kennel in which to bring forth her young , but , when they were sufficiently grown , refused to give it up .</p>
   <p>In all these instances , we see that fable was a mere auxiliary of discourse — an implement of the orator . Such , probably , was the origin of the apologues which now form the bulk of the most popular collections . Aesop , who lived about six hundred years before Christ , so far as we can reach the reality of his life , was an orator who wielded the apologue with remarkable skill . From a servile condition , he rose , by the force of his genius , to be the counsellor of kings and states . His wisdom was in demand far and wide , and on the most important occasions . The pithy apologues which fell from his lips , which , like the rules of arithmetic , solved the difficult problems of human conduct constantly presented to him , were remembered when the speeches that contained them were forgotten . He seems to have written nothing himself ; but it was not long before the gems which he scattered began to be gathered up in collections , as a distinct species of literature . The great and good Socrates employed himself , while in prison , in turning the fables of Aesop into verse . Though but a few fragments of his composition have come down to us , he may , perhaps , be regarded as the father of fable , considered as a distinct art . Induced by his example , many Greek poets and philosophers tried their hands in it . Archilocus , Alcaeus , Aristotle , Plato , Diodorus , Plutarch , and Lucian , have left us specimens . Collections of fables bearing the name of Aesop became current in the Greek language . It was not , however , till the year 1447 that the large collection which now bears his name was put forth in Greek prose by Planudes , a monk of Constantinople . This man turned the life of Aesop itself into a fable ; and La Fontaine did it the honour to translate it as a preface to his own collection . Though burdened with insufferable puerilities , it is not without the moral that a rude and deformed exterior may conceal both wit and worth .</p>
   <p>The collection of fables in Greek verse by Babrias was exceedingly popular among the Romans . It was the favourite book of the Emperor Julian . Only six of these fables , and a few fragments , remain ; but they are sufficient to show that their author possessed all the graces of style which befit the apologue . Some critics place him in the Augustan age ; others make him contemporary with Moschus . His work was versified in Latin , at the instance of Seneca ; and Quinctilian refers to it as a reading-book for boys . Thus , at all times , these playful fictions have been considered fit lessons for children , as well as for men , who are often but grown-up children . So popular were the fables of Babrias and their Latin translation , during the Roman empire , that the work of Phaedrus was hardly noticed . The latter was a freedman of Augustus , and wrote in the reign of Tiberius . His verse stands almost unrivalled for its exquisite elegance and compactness ; and posterity has abundantly avenged him for the neglect of contemporaries . La Fontaine is perhaps more indebted to Phaedrus than to any other of his predecessors ; and , especially in the first six books , his style has much of the same curious condensation . When the seat of the empire was transferred to Byzantium , the Greek language took precedence of the Latin ; and the rhetorician Aphthonius wrote forty fables in Greek prose , which became popular . Besides these collections among the Romans , we find apologues scattered through the writings of their best poets and historians , and embalmed in those specimens of their oratory which have come down to us .</p>
   <p>The apologues of the Greeks and Romans were brief , pithy , and epigrammatic , and their collections were without any principle of connection . But , at the same time , though probably unknown to them , the same species of literature was flourishing elsewhere under a somewhat different form . It is made a question , whether Aesop , through the Assyrians , with whom the Phrygians had commercial relations , did not either borrow his art from the Orientals , or lend it to them . This disputed subject must be left to those who have a taste for such inquiries . Certain it is , however , that fable flourished very anciently with the people whose faith embraces the doctrine of metempsychosis . Among the Hindoos , there are two very ancient collections of fables , which differ from those which we have already mentioned , in having a principle of connection throughout . They are , in fact , extended romances , or dramas , in which all sorts of creatures are introduced as actors , and in which there is a development of sentiment and passion as well as of moral truth , the whole being wrought into a system of morals particularly adapted to the use of those called to govern . One of these works is called the Pantcha Tantra , which signifies “ Five Books , ” or Pentateuch . It is written in prose . The other is called the Hitopadesa , or “ Friendly Instruction , ” and is written in verse . Both are in the ancient Sanscrit language , and bear the name of a Brahmin , Vishnoo Sarmah ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>as the author . Sir William Jones , who is inclined to make this author the true Aesop of the world , and to doubt the existence of the Phrygian , gives him the preference to all other fabulists , both in regard to matter and manner . He has left a prose translation of the Hitopadesa , which , though it may not fully sustain his enthusiastic preference , shows it not to be entirely groundless . We give a sample of it , and select a fable which La Fontaine has served up as the twenty-seventh of his eighth book . It should be understood that the fable , with the moral reflections which accompany it , is taken from the speech of one animal to another .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Vishnoo Sarmah .— Sir William Jones has the name Vishnu-sarman . He says , further , that the word Hitopadesa comes from hita , signifying fortune , prosperity , utility , and upadesa , signifying advice , the entire word meaning “ salutary or amicable instruction . ” — Ed .</p>
   <p>“ Frugality should ever be practised , but not excessive parsimony ; for see how a miser was killed by a bow drawn by himself ! ”</p>
   <p>“ How was that ? ” said Hiranyaca .</p>
   <p>“ In the country of Calyanacataca , ” said Menthara , “ lived a mighty hunter , named Bhairaza , or Terrible . One day he went , in search of game , into a forest on the mountains Vindhya ; when , having slain a fawn , and taken it up , he perceived a boar of tremendous size ; he therefore threw the fawn on the ground , and wounded the boar with an arrow ; the beast , horribly roaring , rushed upon him , and wounded him desperately , so that he fell , like a tree stricken with an axe .</p>
   <p>“ In the meanwhile , a jackal , named Lougery , was roving in search of food ; and , having perceived the fawn , the hunter , and the boar , all three dead , he said to himself , ‘ What a noble provision is here made for me ! ’</p>
   <p>“ As the pains of men assail them unexpectedly , so their pleasures come in the same manner ; a divine power strongly operates in both .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Be it so ; the flesh of these three animals will sustain me a whole month , or longer .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ A man suffices for one month ; a fawn and a boar , for two ; a snake , for a whole day ; and then I will devour the bowstring . ’ When the first impulse of his hunger was allayed , he said , ‘ This flesh is not yet tender ; let me taste the twisted string with which the horns of this bow are joined . ’ So saying , he began to gnaw it ; but , in the instant when he had cut the string , the severed bow leaped forcibly up , and wounded him in the breast , so that he departed in the agonies of death . This I meant , when I cited the verse , Frugality should ever be practised , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>“ What thou givest to distinguished men , and what thou eatest every day — that , in my opinion , is thine own wealth : whose is the remainder which thou hoardest ? ”</p>

   <p>It was one of these books which Chosroës , the king of Persia , caused to be translated from the Sanscrit into the ancient language of his country , in the sixth century of the Christian era , sending an embassy into Hindostan expressly for that purpose . Of the Persian book a translation was made in the time of the Calif Mansour , in the eighth century , into Arabic . This Arabic translation it is which became famous under the title of “ The Book of Calila and Dimna , or the Fables of Bidpaï . "[ 3 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>An English translation from the Arabic appeared in 1819 , done by the Rev . Wyndham Knatchbull . Sir William Jones says that the word Bidpaii signifies beloved , or favourite , physician . And he adds that the word Pilpay , which has taken the place of Bidpaii in some editions of these fables , is the result simply of a blunder in copying the word Bidpaii from the original . La Fontaine himself uses the word Pilpay twice in his Fables , viz ., in Fables XII . and XV ., Book XII .— Ed .</p>
   <p>Calila and Dimna are the names of two jackals that figure in the history , and Bidpaï is one of the principal human interlocutors , who came to be mistaken for the author . This remarkable book was turned into verse by several of the Arabic poets , was translated into Greek , Hebrew , Latin , modern Persian , and , in the course of a few centuries , either directly or indirectly , into most of the languages of modern Europe .</p>
   <p>Forty-one of the unadorned and disconnected fables of Aesop were also translated into Arabic at a period somewhat more recent than the Hegira , and passed by the name of the “ Fables of Lokman . ” Their want of poetical ornament prevented them from acquiring much popularity with the Arabians ; but they became well known in Europe , as furnishing a convenient text-book in the study of Arabic .</p>
   <p>The Hitopadesa , the fountain of poetic fables , with its innumerable translations and modifications , seems to have had the greatest charms for the Orientals . As it passed down the stream of time , version after version , the ornament and machinery outgrew the moral instruction , till it gave birth , at last , to such works of mere amusement as the “ Thousand and One Nights . ”</p>
   <p>Fable slept , with other things , in the dark ages of Europe . Abridgments took the place of the large collections , and probably occasioned the entire loss of some of them . As literature revived , fable was resuscitated . The crusades had brought European mind in contact with the Indian works which we have already described , in their Arabic dress . Translations and imitations in the European tongues were speedily multiplied . The “ Romance of the Fox , ” the work of Perrot de Saint Cloud , one of the most successful of these imitations , dates back to the thirteenth century . It found its way into most of the northern languages , and became a household book . It undoubtedly had great influence over the taste of succeeding ages , shedding upon the severe and satirical wit of the Greek and Roman literature the rich , mellow light of Asiatic poetry . The poets of that age were not confined , however , to fables from the Hindoo source . Marie de France , also , in the thirteenth century , versified one hundred of the fables of Aesop , translating from an English collection , which does not now appear to be extant . Her work is entitled the Ysopet , or “ Little Aesop . ” Other versions , with the same title , were subsequently written . It was in 1447 that Planudes , already referred to , wrote in Greek prose a collection of fables , prefacing it with a life of Aesop , which , for a long time , passed for the veritable work of that ancient . In the next century , Abstemius wrote two hundred fables in Latin prose , partly of modern , but chiefly of ancient invention . At this time , the vulgar languages had undergone so great changes , that works in them of two or three centuries old could not be understood , and , consequently , the Latin became the favourite language of authors . Many collections of fables were written in it , both in prose and verse . By the art of printing these works were greatly multiplied ; and again the poets undertook the task of translating them into the language of the people . The French led the way in this species of literature , their language seeming to present some great advantages for it . One hundred years before La Fontaine , Corrozet , Guillaume Gueroult , and Philibert Hegemon , had written beautiful fables in verse , which it is supposed La Fontaine must have read and profited by , although they had become nearly obsolete in his time . It is a remarkable fact , that these poetical fables should so soon have been forgotten . It was soon after their appearance that the languages of Europe attained their full development ; and , at this epoch , prose seems to have been universally preferred to poetry . So strong was this preference , that Ogilby , the Scotch fabulist , who had written a collection of fables in English verse , reduced them to prose on the occasion of publishing a more splendid edition in 1668 . It seems to have been the settled opinion of the critics of that age , as it has , indeed , been stoutly maintained since , that the ornaments of poetry only impair the force of the fable — that the Muses , by becoming the handmaids of old Aesop , part with their own dignity without conferring any on him . La Fontaine has made such an opinion almost heretical . In his manner there is a perfect originality , and an immortality every way equal to that of the matter which he gathered up from all parts of the great storehouse of human experience . His fables are like pure gold enveloped in solid rock-crystal . In English , a few of the fables of Gay , of Moore , and of Cowper , may be compared with them in some respects , but we have nothing resembling them as a whole . Gay , who has done more than any other , though he has displayed great power of invention , and has given his verse a flow worthy of his master , Pope , has yet fallen far behind La Fontaine in the general management of his materials . His fables are all beautiful poems , but few of them are beautiful fables . His animal speakers do not sufficiently preserve their animal characters . It is quite otherwise with La Fontaine . His beasts are made most nicely to observe all the proprieties not only of the scene in which they are called to speak , but of the great drama into which they are from time to time introduced . His work constitutes an harmonious whole . To those who read it in the original , it is one of the few which never cloy the appetite . As in the poetry of Burns , you are apt to think the last verse you read of him the best .</p>
   <p>But the main object of this Preface was to give a few traces of the life and literary career of our poet . A remarkable poet cannot but have been a remarkable man . Suppose we take a man with native benevolence amounting almost to folly ; but little cunning , caution , or veneration ; good perceptive , but better reflective faculties ; and a dominant love of the beautiful ;— and toss him into the focus of civilization in the age of Louis XIV . It is an interesting problem to find out what will become of him . Such is the problem worked out in the life of JEAN DE LA FONTAINE , born on the eighth of July , 1621 , at Chateau-Thierry . His father , a man of some substance and station , committed two blunders in disposing of his son . First , he encouraged him to seek an education for ecclesiastical life , which was evidently unsuited to his disposition . Second , he brought about his marriage with a woman who was unfitted to secure his affections , or to manage his domestic affairs . In one other point he was not so much mistaken : he laboured unremittingly to make his son a poet . Jean was a backward boy , and showed not the least spark of poetical genius till his twenty-second year . His poetical genius did not ripen till long after that time . But his father lived to see him all , and more than all , that he had ever hoped .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The Translator in his sixth edition replaced the next paragraph by the following remarks :— “ The case is apparently , and only apparently , an exception to the old rule Poeta nascitur , orator fit — the poet is born , the orator is made . The truth is , without exception , that every poet is born such ; and many are born such of whose poetry the world knows nothing . Every known poet is also somewhat an orator ; and as to this part of his character , he is made . And many are known as poets who are altogether made ; they are mere second-hand , or orator poets , and are quite intolerable unless exceedingly well made , which is , unfortunately , seldom the case . It would be wise in them to busy themselves as mere translators . Every one who is born with propensities to love and wonder too strong and deep to be worn off by repetition or continuance ,— in other words , who is born to be always young ,— is born a poet . The other requisites he has of course . Upon him the making will never be lost . The richest gems do most honour to their polishing . But they are gems without any . So there are men who pass through the world with their souls full of poetry , who would not believe you if you were to tell them so . Happy for them is their ignorance , perhaps . La Fontaine came near being one of them . All that is artificial in poetry to him came late and with difficulty . Yet it resulted from his keen relish of nature , that he was never satisfied with his art of verse till he had brought it to the confines of perfection . He did not philosophize over the animals ; he sympathized with them . A philosopher would not have lost a fashionable dinner in his admiration of a common ant-hill . La Fontaine did so once , because the well-known little community was engaged in what he took to be a funeral . He could not in decency leave them till it was over . Verse-making out of the question , this was to be a genuine poet , though , with commonplace mortals , it was also to be a fool . ”</p>
   <p>But we will first , in few words , despatch the worst — for there is a very bad part — of his life . It was not specially his life ; it was the life of the age in which he lived . The man of strong amorous propensities , in that age and country , who was , nevertheless , faithful to vows of either marriage or celibacy ,— the latter vows then proved sadly dangerous to the former ,— may be regarded as a miracle . La Fontaine , without any agency of his own affections , found himself married at the age of twenty-six , while yet as immature as most men are at sixteen . The upshot was , that his patrimony dwindled ; and , though he lived many years with his wife , and had a son , he neglected her more and more , till at last he forgot that he had been married , though he unfortunately did not forget that there were other women in the world besides his wife . His genius and benevolence gained him friends everywhere with both sexes , who never suffered him to want , and who had never cause to complain of his ingratitude . But he was always the special favourite of the Aspasias who ruled France and her kings . To please them , he wrote a great deal of fine poetry , much of which deserves to be everlastingly forgotten . It must be said for him , that his vice became conspicuous only in the light of one of his virtues . His frankness would never allow concealment . He scandalized his friends Boileau and Racine ; still , it is matter of doubt whether they did not excel him rather in prudence than in purity . But , whatever may be said in palliation , it is lamentable to think that a heaven-lighted genius should have been made , in any way , to minister to a hell-envenomed vice , which has caused unutterable woes to France and the world . Some time before he died , he repented bitterly of this part of his course , and laboured , no doubt sincerely , to repair the mischiefs he had done .</p>
   <p>As we have already said , Jean was a backward boy . But , under a dull exterior , the mental machinery was working splendidly within . He lacked all that outside care and prudence ,— that constant looking out for breakers ,— which obstruct the growth and ripening of the reflective faculties . The vulgar , by a queer mistake , call a man absent-minded , when his mind shuts the door , pulls in the latch-string , and is wholly at home . La Fontaine 's mind was exceedingly domestic . It was nowhere but at home when , riding from Paris to Chateau-Thierry , a bundle of papers fell from his saddle-bow without his perceiving it . The mail-carrier , coming behind him , picked it up , and overtaking La Fontaine , asked him if he had lost anything . “ Certainly not , ” he replied , looking about him with great surprise . “ Well , I have just picked up these papers , ” rejoined the other . “ Ah ! they are mine , ” cried La Fontaine ; “ they involve my whole estate . ” And he eagerly reached to take them . On another occasion he was equally at home . Stopping on a journey , he ordered dinner at an hotel , and then took a ramble about the town . On his return , he entered another hotel , and , passing through into the garden , took from his pocket a copy of Livy , in which he quietly set himself to read till his dinner should be ready . The book made him forget his appetite , till a servant informed him of his mistake , and he returned to his hotel just in time to pay his bill and proceed on his journey .</p>
   <p>It will be perceived that he took the world quietly , and his doing so undoubtedly had important bearings on his style . We give another anecdote , which illustrates this peculiarity of his mind as well as the superlative folly of duelling . Not long after his marriage , with all his indifference to his wife , he was persuaded into a fit of singular jealousy . He was intimate with an ex-captain of dragoons , by name Poignant , who had retired to Chateau-Thierry ; a frank , open-hearted man , but of extremely little gallantry . Whenever Poignant was not at his inn , he was at La Fontaine 's , and consequently with his wife , when he himself was not at home . Some person took it in his head to ask La Fontaine why he suffered these constant visits . “ And why , ” said La Fontaine , “ should I not ? He is my best friend . ” “ The public think otherwise , ” was the reply ; “ they say that he comes for the sake of Madame La Fontaine . ” “ The public is mistaken ; but what must I do in the case ? ” said the poet . “ You must demand satisfaction , sword in hand , of one who has dishonoured you . ” “ Very well , ” said La Fontaine , “ I will demand it . ” The next day he called on Poignant , at four o'clock in the morning , and found him in bed . “ Rise , ” said he , “ and come out with me ! ” His friend asked him what was the matter , and what pressing business had brought him so early in the morning . “ I shall let you know , ” replied La Fontaine , “ when we get abroad . ” Poignant , in great astonishment , rose , followed him out , and asked whither he was leading . “ You shall know by-and-by , ” replied La Fontaine ; and at last , when they had reached a retired place , he said , “ My friend , we must fight . ” Poignant , still more surprised , sought to know in what he had offended him , and moreover represented to him that they were not on equal terms . “ I am a man of war , ” said he , “ while , as for you , you have never drawn a sword . ” “ No matter , ” said La Fontaine ; “ the public requires that I should fight you . ” Poignant , after having resisted in vain , at last drew his sword , and , having easily made himself master of La Fontaine 's , demanded the cause of the quarrel . “ The public maintains , ” said La Fontaine , “ that you come to my house daily , not for my sake , but my wife 's . ” “ Ah ! my friend , ” replied the other , “ I should never have suspected that was the cause of your displeasure , and I protest I will never again put a foot within your doors . ” “ On the contrary , ” replied La Fontaine , seizing him by the hand , “ I have satisfied the public , and now you must come to my house , every day , or I will fight you again . ” The two antagonists returned , and breakfasted together in good-humour .</p>
   <p>It was not , as we have said , till his twenty-second year , that La Fontaine showed any taste for poetry . The occasion was this :— An officer , in winter-quarters at Chateau-Thierry , one day read to him , with great spirit , an ode of Malherbe , beginning thus —</p>

   <p>La Fontaine listened with involuntary transports of joy , admiration , and astonishment , as if a man born with a genius for music , but brought up in a desert , had for the first time heard a well-played instrument . He set himself immediately to reading Malherbe , passed his nights in learning his verses by heart , and his days in declaiming them in solitary places . He also read Voiture , and began to write verses in imitation . Happily , at this period , a relative named Pintrel directed his attention to ancient literature , and advised him to make himself familiar with Horace , Homer , Virgil , Terence , and Quinctilian . He accepted this counsel . M. de Maucroix , another of his friends , who cultivated poetry with success , also contributed to confirm his taste for the ancient models . His great delight , however , was to read Plato and Plutarch , which he did only through translations . The copies which he used are said to bear his manuscript notes on almost every page , and these notes are the maxims which are to be found in his fables . Returning from this study of the ancients , he read the moderns with more discrimination . His favourites , besides Malherbe , were Corneille , Rabelais , and Marot . In Italian , he read Ariosto , Boccaccio , and Machiavel . In 1654 he published his first work , a translation of the Eunuch of Terence . It met with no success . But this does not seem at all to have disturbed its author . He cultivated verse-making with as much ardour and good-humour as ever ; and his verses soon began to be admired in the circle of his friends . No man had ever more devoted friends . Verses that have cost thought are not relished without thought . When a genius appears , it takes some little time for the world to educate itself to a knowledge of the fact . By one of his friends , La Fontaine was introduced to Fouquet , the minister of finance , a man of great power , and who rivalled his sovereign in wealth and luxury . It was his pride to be the patron of literary men , and he was pleased to make La Fontaine his poet , settling on him a pension of one thousand francs per annum , on condition that he should produce a piece in verse each quarter ,— a condition which was exactly complied with till the fall of the minister .</p>
   <p>Fouquet was a most splendid villain , and positively , though perhaps not comparatively , deserved to fall . But it was enough for La Fontaine that Fouquet had done him a kindness . He took the part of the disgraced minister , without counting the cost . His “ Elegy to the nymphs of Vaux ” was a shield to the fallen man , and turned popular hatred into sympathy . The good-hearted poet rejoiced exceedingly in its success . Bon-homme was the appellation which his friends pleasantly gave him , and by which he became known everywhere ;— and never did a man better deserve it in its best sense . He was good by nature — not by the calculation of consequences . Indeed it does not seem ever to have occurred to him that kindness , gratitude , and truth , could have any other than good consequences . He was truly a Frenchman without guile , and possessed to perfection that comfortable trait ,— in which French character is commonly allowed to excel the English ,— good-humour with the whole world .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine was the intimate friend of Molière , Boileau , and Racine . Molière had already established a reputation ; but the others became known to the world at the same time . Boileau hired a small chamber in the Faubourg Saint Germain , where they all met several times a week ; for La Fontaine , at the age of forty-four , had left Chateau-Thierry , and become a citizen of Paris . Here they discussed all sorts of topics , admitting to their society Chapelle , a man of less genius , but of greater conversational powers , than either of them — a sort of connecting link between them and the world . Four poets , or four men , could hardly have been more unlike . Boileau was blustering , blunt , peremptory , but honest and frank ; Racine , of a pleasant and tranquil gaiety , but mischievous and sarcastic ; Molière was naturally considerate , pensive , and melancholy ; La Fontaine was often absent-minded , but sometimes exceedingly jovial , delighting with his sallies , his witty naïvetés , and his arch simplicity . These meetings , which no doubt had a great influence upon French literature , La Fontaine , in one of his prefaces , thus describes :— “ Four friends , whose acquaintance had begun at the foot of Parnassus , held a sort of society , which I should call an Academy , if their number had been sufficiently great , and if they had had as much regard for the Muses as for pleasure . The first thing which they did was to banish from among them all rules of conversation , and everything which savours of the academic conference . When they met , and had sufficiently discussed their amusements , if chance threw them upon any point of science or belles-lettres , they profited by the occasion ; it was , however , without dwelling too long on the same subject , flitting from one thing to another like the bees that meet divers sorts of flowers on their way . Neither envy , malice , nor cabal , had any voice among them . They adored the works of the ancients , never refused due praise to those of the moderns , spoke modestly of their own , and gave each other sincere counsel , when any one of them — which rarely happened — fell into the malady of the age , and published a book . ”</p>
   <p>The absent-mindedness of our fabulist not unfrequently created much amusement on these occasions , and made him the object of mirthful conspiracies . So keenly was the game pursued by Boileau and Racine , that the more considerate Molière felt obliged sometimes to expose and rebuke them . Once , after having done so , he privately told a stranger , who was present with them , the wits would have worried themselves in vain ; they could not have obliterated the bon-homme .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine , as we have said , was an admirer of Rabelais ;— to what a pitch , the following anecdote may show . At one of the meetings at Boileau 's were present Racine , Valincourt , and a brother of Boileau 's , a doctor of the Sorbonne . The latter took it upon him to set forth the merits of St. Augustin in a pompous eulogium . La Fontaine , plunged in one of his habitual reveries , listened without hearing . At last , rousing himself as if from a profound sleep , to prove that the conversation had not been lost upon him , he asked the doctor , with a very serious air , whether he thought St. Augustin had as much wit as Rabelais . The divine , surprised , looked at him from head to foot , and only replied , “ Take care , Monsieur La Fontaine ;— you have put one of your stockings on wrong side outwards ” — which was the fact .</p>
   <p>It was in 1668 that La Fontaine published his first collection of fables , under the modest title Fables Choisies , mises en Vers , in a quarto volume , with figures designed and engraved by Chauveau . It contained six books , and was dedicated to the Dauphin . Many of the fables had already been published in a separate form . The success of this collection was so great , that it was reprinted the same year in a smaller size . Fables had come to be regarded as beneath poetry ; La Fontaine established them at once on the top of Parnassus . The ablest poets of his age did not think it beneath them to enter the lists with him ; and it is needless to say they came off second best .</p>
   <p>One of the fables of the first book is addressed to the Duke de la Rochefoucauld , and was the consequence of a friendship between La Fontaine and the author of the celebrated “ Maxims . ” Connected with the duke was Madame La Fayette , one of the most learned and ingenious women of her age , who consequently became the admirer and friend of the fabulist . To her he wrote verses abundantly , as he did to all who made him the object of their kind regard . Indeed , notwithstanding his avowed indolence , or rather passion for quiet and sleep , his pen was very productive . In 1669 , he published “ Psyché , ” a romance in prose and verse , which he dedicated to the Duchess de Bouillon , in gratitude for many kindnesses . The prose is said to be better than the verse ; but this can hardly be true in respect to the following lines , in which the poet under the apt name of Polyphile , in a hymn addressed to Pleasure , undoubtedly sketches himself :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Volupté , Volupté , qui fus jadis maîtresse</l>
     <l n="2">Du plus bel esprit de la Grèce ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ne me dédaigne pas ; viens-t'en loger chez moi :</l>
     <l n="4">Tu n'y seras pas sans emploi :</l>
     <l n="5">J'aime le jeu , l'amour , les livres , la musique ,</l>
     <l n="6">La ville et la campagne , enfin tout ; il n'est rien</l>

     <l n="8">Jusqu'au sombre plaisir d'un coeur mélancolique .</l>
     <l n="9">Viens donc ....</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The characteristic grace and playfulness of this seem to defy translation . To the mere English reader , the sense may be roughly given thus :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Delight , Delight , who didst as mistress hold</l>
     <l n="2">The finest wit of Grecian mould ,</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>To be “ rebels against Love ” was quite unpardonable with La Fontaine ; and to bring about a “ hymen forcé ” was a crime , of which he probably spoke with some personal feeling . The great popularity of “ Psyché ” encouraged the author to publish two volumes of poems and tales in 1671 , in which were contained several new fables . The celebrated Madame de Sévigné thus speaks of these fables , in one of her letters to her daughter :— “ But have you not admired the beauty of the five or six fables of La Fontaine contained in one of the volumes which I sent you ? We were charmed with them the other day at M. de la Rochefoucauld 's : we got by art that of the Monkey and the Cat . ” Then , quoting some lines , she adds ,— “ This is painting ! And the Pumpkin — and the Nightingale — they are worthy of the first volume ! ” It was in his stories that La Fontaine excelled ; and Madame de Sévigné expresses a wish to invent a fable which would impress upon him the folly of leaving his peculiar province . He seemed himself not insensible where his strength lay , and seldom ventured upon any other ground , except at the instance of his friends . With all his lightness , he felt a deep veneration for religion — the most spiritual and rigid which came within the circle of his immediate acquaintance . He admired Jansenius and the Port Royalists , and heartily loved Racine , who was of their faith . Count Henri-Louis de Loménie , of Brienne ,— who , after being secretary of state , had retired to the Oratoire ,— was engaged in bringing out a better collection of Christian lyrics . To this work he pressed La Fontaine , whom he called his particular friend , to lend his name and contributions . Thus the author of “ Psyché , ” “ Adonis , ” and “ Joconde , ” was led to the composition of pious hymns , and versifications of the Psalms of David . Gifted by nature with the utmost frankness of disposition , he sympathized fully with Arnauld and Pascal in the war against the Jesuits ; and it would seem , from his Ballade sur Escobar , that he had read and relished the “ Provincial Letters . ” This ballad , as it may be a curiosity to many , shall be given entire :—</p>

   <p>The verses of La Fontaine did more for his reputation than for his purse . His paternal estate wasted away under his carelessness ; for , when the ends of the year refused to meet , he sold a piece of land sufficient to make them do so . His wife , no better qualified to manage worldly gear than himself , probably lived on her family friends , who were able to support her , and who seem to have done so without blaming him . She had lived with him in Paris for some time after that city became his abode ; but , tiring at length of the city life , she had returned at Château-Thierry , and occupied the family mansion . At the earnest expostulation of Boileau and Racine , who wished to make him a better husband , he returned to Château-Thierry himself , in 1666 , for the purpose of becoming reconciled to his wife . But his purpose strangely vanished . He called at his own house , learned from the domestic , who did not know him , that Madame La Fontaine was in good health , and passed on to the house of a friend , where he tarried two days , and then returned to Paris without having seen his wife . When his friends inquired of him his success , with some confusion he replied , “ I have been to see her , but I did not find her : she was well . ” Twenty years after that , Racine prevailed on him to visit his patrimonial estate , to take some care of what remained . Racine , not hearing from him , sent to know what he was about , when La Fontaine wrote as follows :— “ Poignant , on his return from Paris , told me that you took my silence in very bad part ; the worse , because you had been told that I have been incessantly at work since my arrival at Château-Thierry , and that , instead of applying myself to my affairs , I have had nothing in my head but verses . All this is no more than half true : my affairs occupy me as much as they deserve to — that is to say not at all ; but the leisure which they leave me — it is not poetry , but idleness , which makes away with it . ” On a certain occasion , in the earlier part of his life , when pressed in regard to his improvidence , he gaily produced the following epigram , which has commonly been appended to his fables as “ The Epitaph of La Fontaine , written by Himself ":—</p>

     <l n="7">This confession , the immortality of which was so little foreseen by its</l>
     <l n="8">author , liberally rendered , amounts to the following :—</l>

     <l n="10">Held treasure to be but the cause of disputes ;</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It is clear that a man who provided so little for himself needed good friends to do it ; and Heaven kindly furnished them . When his affairs began to be straitened , he was invited by the celebrated Madame de la Sablière to make her house his home ; and there , in fact , he was thoroughly domiciliated for twenty years . “ I have sent away all my domestics , ” said that lady , one day ; “ I have kept only my dog , my cat , and La Fontaine . ” She was , perhaps , the best-educated woman in France , was the mistress of several languages , knew Horace and Virgil by heart , and had been thoroughly indoctrinated in all the sciences by the ablest masters . Her husband , M. Rambouillet de la Sablière , was secretary to the king , and register of domains , and to immense wealth united considerable poetical talents , with a thorough knowledge of the world . It was the will of Madame de la Sablière , that her favourite poet should have no further care for his external wants ; and never was a mortal more perfectly resigned . He did all honour to the sincerity of his amiable hostess ; and , if he ever showed a want of independence , he certainly did not of gratitude . Compliments of more touching tenderness we nowhere meet than those which La Fontaine has paid to his benefactress . He published nothing which was not first submitted to her eye , and entered into her affairs and friendships with all his heart . Her unbounded confidence in his integrity she expressed by saying , “ La Fontaine never lies in prose . ” By her death , in 1693 , our fabulist was left without a home ; but his many friends vied with each other which should next furnish one . He was then seventy-two years of age , had turned his attention to personal religion , and received the seal of conversion at the hands of the Roman Catholic church . In his conversion , as in the rest of his life , his frankness left no room to doubt his sincerity . The writings which had justly given offence to the good were made the subject of a public confession , and everything in his power was done to prevent their circulation . The death of one who had done so much for him , and whose last days , devoted with the most self-denying benevolence to the welfare of her species , had taught him a most salutary lesson , could not but be deeply felt . He had just left the house of his deceased benefactress , never again to enter it , when he met M. d'Hervart in the street , who eagerly said to him , “ My dear La Fontaine , I was looking for you , to beg you to come and take lodgings in my house . ” “ I was going thither , ” replied La Fontaine . A reply could not have more characteristic . The fabulist had not in him sufficient hypocrisy of which to manufacture the commonplace politeness of society . His was the politeness of a warm and unsuspecting heart . He never concealed his confidence in the fear that it might turn out to be misplaced .</p>
   <p>His second collection of fables , containing five books , La Fontaine published in 1678-9 , with a dedication to Madame de Montespan ; the previous six books were republished at the same time , revised , and enlarged . The twelfth book was not added till many years after , and proved , in fact , the song of the dying swan . It was written for the special use of the young Duke de Bourgogne , the royal pupil of Fénélon , to whom it contains frequent allusions . The eleven books now published sealed the reputation of La Fontaine , and were received with distinguished regard by the king , who appended to the ordinary protocol or imprimatur for publication the following reasons : “ in order to testify to the author the esteem we have for his person and his merit , and because youth have received great advantage in their education from the fables selected and put in verse , which he has heretofore published . ” The author was , moreover , permitted to present his book in person to the sovereign . For this purpose he repaired to Versailles , and after having well delivered himself of his compliment to royalty , perceived that he had forgotten to bring the book which he was to present ; he was , nevertheless , favourably received , and loaded with presents . But it is added , that , on his return , he also lost , by his absence of mind , the purse full of gold which the king had given him , which was happily found under a cushion of the carriage in which he rode .</p>
   <p>In his advertisement to the second part of his Fables , La Fontaine informs the reader that he had treated his subjects in a somewhat different style . In fact , in his first collection , he had timidly confined himself to the brevity of Aesop and Phaedrus ; but , having observed that those fables were most popular in which he had given most scope to his own genius , he threw off the trammels in the second collection , and , in the opinion of the writer , much for the better . His subjects , too , in the second part , are frequently derived from the Indian fabulists , and bring with them the richness and dramatic interest of the Hitopadesa .</p>
   <p>Of all his fables , the Oak and the Reed is said to have been the favourite of La Fontaine . But his critics have almost unanimously given the palm of excellence to the Animals sick of the Plague , the first of the seventh book . Its exquisite poetry , the perfection of its dialogue , and the weight of its moral , well entitle it to the place . That must have been a soul replete with honesty , which could read such a lesson in the ears of a proud and oppressive court . Indeed , we may look in vain through this encyclopaedia of fable for a sentiment which goes to justify the strong in their oppression of the weak . Even in the midst of the fulsome compliments which it was the fashion of his age to pay to royalty , La Fontaine maintains a reserve and decency peculiar to himself . By an examination of his fables , we think , we might fairly establish for him the character of an honest and disinterested lover and respecter of his species . In his fable entitled Death and the Dying , he unites the genius of Pascal and Molière ; in that of the Two Doves is a tenderness quite peculiar to himself , and an insight into the heart worthy of Shakspeare . In his Mogul 's Dream are sentiments worthy of the very high-priest of nature , and expressed in his own native tongue with a felicity which makes the translator feel that all his labours are but vanity and vexation of spirit . But it is not the purpose of this brief Preface to criticize the Fables . It is sufficient to say , that the work occupies a position in French literature , which , after all has been said that can be for Gay , Moore , and other English versifiers of fables , is left quite vacant in ours .</p>
   <p>Our author was elected a member of the French Academy in 1684 , and received with the honour of a public session . He read on this occasion a poem of exquisite beauty , addressed to his benefactress , Madame de la Sablière . In that distinguished body of men he was a universal favourite , and none , perhaps , did more to promote its prime object — the improvement of the French language . We have already seen how he was regarded by some of the greatest minds of his age . Voltaire , who never did more than justice to merit other than his own , said of the Fables , “ I hardly know a book which more abounds with charms adapted to the people , and at the same time to persons of refined taste . I believe that , of all authors , La Fontaine is the most universally read . He is for all minds and all ages . ” La Bruyère , when admitted to the Academy , in 1693 , was warmly applauded for his éloge upon La Fontaine , which contained the following words :— “ More equal than Marot , and more poetical than Voiture , La Fontaine has the playfulness , felicity , and artlessness of both . He instructs while he sports , persuades men to virtue by means of beasts , and exalts trifling subjects to the sublime ; a man unique in his species of composition , always original , whether he invents or translates ,— who has gone beyond his models , himself a model hard to imitate . ”</p>
   <p>La Fontaine , as we have said , devoted his latter days to religion . In this he was sustained and cheered by his old friends Racine and De Maucroix . Death overtook him while applying his poetical powers to the hymns of the church . To De Maucroix he wrote , a little before his death ,— “ I assure you that the best of your friends cannot count upon more than fifteen days of life . For these two months I have not gone abroad , except occasionally to attend the Academy , for a little amusement . Yesterday , as I was returning from it , in the middle of the Rue du Chantre , I was taken with such a faintness that I really thought myself dying . O , my friend , to die is nothing : but think you how I am going to appear before God ! You know how I have lived . Before you receive this billet , the gates of eternity will perhaps have been opened upon me ! ” To this , a few days after , his friend replied ,— “ If God , in his kindness , restores you to health , I hope you will come and spend the rest of your life with me , and we shall often talk together of the mercies of God . If , however , you have not strength to write , beg M. Racine to do me that kindness , the greatest he can ever do for me . Adieu , my good , my old , and my true friend . May God , in his infinite , goodness , take care of the health of your body , and that of your soul . ” He died the 13th of April , 1695 , at the age of seventy-three , and was buried in the cemetery of the Saints-Innocents .</p>
   <p>When Fénélon heard of his death , he wrote a Latin eulogium , which he gave to his royal pupil to translate . “ La Fontaine is no more ! ” said Fénélon , in this composition ; “ he is no more ! and with him have gone the playful jokes , the merry laugh , the artless graces , and the sweet Muses . ”</p>

     <l n="20">Fables , which comprised Books I. to VI ., published in 1668 . The</l>
     <l n="21">Dauphin was Louis , the only son of Louis XIV . and Marie-Thérèse of</l>
     <l n="22">Austria . He was born at Fontainebleau in 1661 , and died at Meudon in</l>
     <l n="23">1712 , before his father , the “ Grand Monarque , ” had ceased to reign .</l>
     <l n="24">The Dauphin being but a child , between six and seven years old , at</l>
     <l n="25">the time of this dedication , La Fontaine 's act may be viewed rather</l>

      <l n="8">To her neighbour the ant ,</l>
      <l n="9">For the loan of some wheat ,</l>
      <l n="10">Which would serve her to eat ,</l>

     <l n="1">Perch 'd on a lofty oak ,</l>

     <l n="6">Well , your coat , sir , is a brave one !</l>
     <l n="7">So black and glossy , on my word , sir ,</l>

     <l n="10">Sir Raven , overset with praise ,</l>
     <l n="11">Must show how musical his croak .</l>
     <l n="12">Down fell the luncheon from the oak ;</l>
     <l n="13">Which snatching up , Sir Fox thus spoke :—</l>
     <l n="14">‘ The flatterer , my good sir ,</l>

     <l n="16">Which lesson , if you please ,</l>

      <l n="47">One , oats ; the other , silver of the tax .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
      <l n="48">The latter glorying in his load ,</l>
      <l n="49">March 'd proudly forward on the road ;</l>
      <l n="50">And , from the jingle of his bell ,</l>
      <l n="51">‘ Twas plain he liked his burden well .</l>
      <l n="52">But in a wild-wood glen</l>
      <l n="53">A band of robber men</l>

      <l n="55">Well with the silver pleased ,</l>
      <l n="56">They by the bridle seized</l>
      <l n="57">The treasure-mule so vain .</l>
      <l n="58">Poor mule ! in struggling to repel</l>
      <l n="59">His ruthless foes , he fell</l>
      <l n="60">Stabb 'd through ; and with a bitter sighing ,</l>
      <l n="61">He cried , ‘ Is this the lot they promised me ?</l>
      <l n="62">My humble friend from danger free ,</l>
      <l n="63">While , weltering in my gore , I 'm dying ? ’</l>
      <l n="64">‘ My friend , ’ his fellow-mule replied ,</l>

    <head>V .— THE WOLF AND THE DOG .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A prowling wolf , whose shaggy skin</l>
     <l n="2">( So strict the watch of dogs had been )</l>
     <l n="3">Hid little but his bones ,</l>
     <l n="4">Once met a mastiff dog astray .</l>
     <l n="5">A prouder , fatter , sleeker Tray ,</l>
     <l n="6">No human mortal owns .</l>
     <l n="7">Sir Wolf in famish 'd plight ,</l>
     <l n="8">Would fain have made a ration</l>
     <l n="9">Upon his fat relation ;</l>
     <l n="10">But then he first must fight ;</l>
     <l n="11">And well the dog seem 'd able</l>
     <l n="12">To save from wolfish table</l>
     <l n="13">His carcass snug and tight .</l>
     <l n="14">So , then , in civil conversation</l>
     <l n="15">The wolf express 'd his admiration</l>
     <l n="16">Of Tray 's fine case . Said Tray , politely ,</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Yourself , good sir , may be as sightly ;</l>
     <l n="18">Quit but the woods , advised by me .</l>
     <l n="19">For all your fellows here , I see ,</l>
     <l n="20">Are shabby wretches , lean and gaunt ,</l>
     <l n="21">Belike to die of haggard want .</l>
     <l n="22">With such a pack , of course it follows ,</l>
     <l n="23">One fights for every bit he swallows .</l>
     <l n="24">Come , then , with me , and share</l>
     <l n="25">On equal terms our princely fare . ’</l>
     <l n="26">‘ But what with you</l>
     <l n="27">Has one to do ? ’</l>
     <l n="28">Inquires the wolf . ‘ Light work indeed , ’</l>
     <l n="29">Replies the dog ; ‘ you only need</l>
     <l n="30">To bark a little now and then ,</l>
     <l n="31">To chase off duns and beggar men ,</l>
     <l n="32">To fawn on friends that come or go forth ,</l>
     <l n="33">Your master please , and so forth ;</l>
     <l n="34">For which you have to eat</l>
     <l n="35">All sorts of well-cook 'd meat —</l>
     <l n="36">Cold pullets , pigeons , savoury messes —</l>
     <l n="37">Besides unnumber 'd fond caresses . ’</l>
     <l n="38">The wolf , by force of appetite ,</l>
     <l n="39">Accepts the terms outright ,</l>
     <l n="40">Tears glistening in his eyes .</l>
     <l n="41">But faring on , he spies</l>
     <l n="42">A gall 'd spot on the mastiff 's neck .</l>
     <l n="43">‘ What 's that ? ’ he cries . ‘ O , nothing but a speck . ’</l>
     <l n="44">‘ A speck ? ’ ‘ Ay , ay ; ‘ tis not enough to pain me ;</l>
     <l n="45">Perhaps the collar 's mark by which they chain me . ’</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Chain ! chain you ! What ! run you not , then ,</l>
     <l n="47">Just where you please , and when ? ’</l>
     <l n="48">‘ Not always , sir ; but what of that ? ’</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Enough for me , to spoil your fat !</l>
     <l n="50">It ought to be a precious price</l>
     <l n="51">Which could to servile chains entice ;</l>
     <l n="52">For me , I 'll shun them while I 've wit . ’</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>This is one of La Fontaine 's most admired fables , and is one of the few for which he did not go for the groundwork to some older fabulist . The Duke de la Rochefoucauld , to whom it was dedicated , was the author of the famous “ Reflexions et Maximes Morales , ” which La Fontaine praises in the last lines of his fable . La Rochefoucauld was La Fontaine 's friend and patron . The “ Maximes ” had achieved a second edition just prior to La Fontaine 's publication of this first series of his Fables , in 1668 . “ The Rabbits ” ( Book X ., Fable 15 . ) , published in the second collection , in 1678-9 , is also dedicated to the Duke , who died the following year , 1680 .

Dr. Johnson ( writing upon Gay 's Fables ) agrees in this dictum “ generally . ” But hardly any of the fabulists , from Aesop downwards , seem to have bound themselves by the rule ; and in this fable we have La Fontaine rather exulting in his assignment of speech , &amp; c ., not only to the lower animals but to “ plants and trees , ” &amp; c ., as well as otherwise defying the “ hard to suit , ” i. e ., the critics .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Half-a-dozen baby stories .— Here La Fontaine exalts his muse as a fabulist . This is in reply to certain of his critics who pronounced his work puerile , and pretended to wish him to adopt the higher forms of poetry . Some of the fables of the first six Books were originally published in a semi-private way before 1668 . See the Translators Preface . La Fontaine defends his art as a writer of fables also in Book III . ( Fable I . ) ; Book V. ( Fable I . ) ; Book VI . ( Fable I . ) ; Book VII . ( Introduction ) ; Book VIII .

      <l n="111">John Rabbit , by Dame Eagle chased ,</l>
      <l n="112">Was making for his hole in haste ,</l>
      <l n="113">When , on his way , he met a beetle 's burrow .</l>
      <l n="114">I leave you all to think</l>
      <l n="115">If such a little chink</l>
      <l n="116">Could to a rabbit give protection thorough .</l>
      <l n="117">But , since no better could be got ,</l>
      <l n="118">John Rabbit there was fain to squat .</l>
      <l n="119">Of course , in an asylum so absurd ,</l>
      <l n="120">John felt ere long the talons of the bird .</l>
      <l n="121">But first , the beetle , interceding , cried ,</l>
      <l n="122">‘ Great queen of birds , it cannot be denied ,</l>
      <l n="123">That , maugre my protection , you can bear</l>
      <l n="124">My trembling guest , John Rabbit , through the air .</l>
      <l n="125">But do not give me such affront , I pray ;</l>
      <l n="126">And since he craves your grace ,</l>
      <l n="127">In pity of his case ,</l>
      <l n="128">Grant him his life , or take us both away ;</l>
      <l n="129">For he 's my gossip , friend , and neighbour . ’</l>
      <l n="130">In vain the beetle 's friendly labour ;</l>
      <l n="131">The eagle clutch 'd her prey without reply ,</l>
      <l n="132">And as she flapp 'd her vasty wings to fly ,</l>
      <l n="133">Struck down our orator and still 'd him ;</l>
      <l n="134">The wonder is she had n't kill 'd him .</l>
      <l n="135">The beetle soon , of sweet revenge in quest ,</l>
      <l n="136">Flew to the old , gnarl 'd mountain oak ,</l>
      <l n="137">Which proudly bore that haughty eagle 's nest .</l>
      <l n="138">And while the bird was gone ,</l>
      <l n="139">Her eggs , her cherish 'd eggs , he broke ,</l>
      <l n="140">Not sparing one .</l>
      <l n="141">Returning from her flight , the eagle 's cry ,</l>
      <l n="142">Of rage and bitter anguish , fill 'd the sky .</l>
      <l n="143">But , by excess of passion blind ,</l>
      <l n="144">Her enemy she fail 'd to find .</l>
      <l n="145">Her wrath in vain , that year it was her fate</l>
      <l n="146">To live a mourning mother , desolate .</l>
      <l n="147">The next , she built a loftier nest ; ‘ twas vain ;</l>
      <l n="148">The beetle found and dash 'd her eggs again .</l>
      <l n="149">John Rabbit 's death was thus revenged anew .</l>
      <l n="150">The second mourning for her murder 'd brood</l>
      <l n="151">Was such , that through the giant mountain wood ,</l>
      <l n="152">For six long months , the sleepless echo flew .</l>
      <l n="153">The bird , once Ganymede , now made</l>
      <l n="154">Her prayer to Jupiter for aid ;</l>
      <l n="155">And , laying them within his godship 's lap ,</l>
      <l n="156">She thought her eggs now safe from all mishap ;</l>
      <l n="157">The god his own could not but make them —</l>
      <l n="158">No wretch , would venture there to break them .</l>
      <l n="159">And no one did . Their enemy , this time ,</l>
      <l n="160">Upsoaring to a place sublime ,</l>
      <l n="161">Let fall upon his royal robes some dirt ,</l>
      <l n="162">Which Jove just shaking , with a sudden flirt ,</l>
      <l n="163">Threw out the eggs , no one knows whither .</l>
      <l n="164">When Jupiter inform 'd her how th ’ event</l>
      <l n="165">Occurr 'd by purest accident ,</l>
      <l n="166">The eagle raved ; there was no reasoning with her ;</l>
      <l n="167">She gave out threats of leaving court ,</l>
      <l n="168">To make the desert her resort ,</l>
      <l n="169">And other brav'ries of this sort .</l>
      <l n="170">Poor Jupiter in silence heard</l>
      <l n="171">The uproar of his favourite bird .</l>
      <l n="172">Before his throne the beetle now appear 'd ,</l>
      <l n="173">And by a clear complaint the mystery clear 'd .</l>
      <l n="174">The god pronounced the eagle in the wrong .</l>
      <l n="175">But still , their hatred was so old and strong ,</l>
      <l n="176">These enemies could not be reconciled ;</l>
      <l n="177">And , that the general peace might not be spoil 'd ,—</l>
      <l n="178">The best that he could do ,— the god arranged ,</l>
      <l n="179">That thence the eagle 's pairing should be changed ,</l>
      <l n="180">To come when beetle folks are only found</l>
      <l n="181">Conceal 'd and dormant under ground .</l>

      <l n="183">‘ Go , paltry insect , nature 's meanest brat ! ’</l>

      <l n="207">When on his battle-ground he saw ,</l>

      <l n="209">Had got its proper beauty</l>
      <l n="210">By doing bloody duty ;</l>
      <l n="211">Himself , the hapless lion , tore his hide ,</l>

      <l n="218">The gnat retires with verdant laurel .</l>

      <l n="31">To sell their ass went to a fair one day .</l>
      <l n="32">In order there to get the highest price ,</l>
      <l n="33">They needs must keep their donkey fresh and nice ;</l>
      <l n="34">So , tying fast his feet , they swung him clear ,</l>
      <l n="35">And bore him hanging like a chandelier .</l>
      <l n="36">Alas ! poor , simple-minded country fellows !</l>
      <l n="37">The first that sees their load , loud laughing , bellows ,</l>
      <l n="38">“ What farce is this to split good people 's sides ?</l>
      <l n="39">The most an ass is not the one that rides ! ”</l>
      <l n="40">The miller , much enlighten 'd by this talk ,</l>
      <l n="41">Untied his precious beast , and made him walk .</l>
      <l n="42">The ass , who liked the other mode of travel ,</l>
      <l n="43">Bray 'd some complaint at trudging on the gravel ;</l>
      <l n="44">Whereat , not understanding well the beast ,</l>
      <l n="45">The miller caused his hopeful son to ride ,</l>
      <l n="46">And walk 'd behind , without a spark of pride .</l>
      <l n="47">Three merchants pass 'd , and , mightily displeased ,</l>
      <l n="48">The eldest of these gentlemen cried out ,</l>

      <l n="52">“ To please you , sirs , ” the miller said , “ I ought . ”</l>
      <l n="53">So down the young and up the old man got .</l>
      <l n="54">Three girls next passing , “ What a shame ! ” says one ,</l>
      <l n="55">“ That boy should be obliged on foot to run ,</l>

      <l n="58">“ Please save your wit , ” the miller made reply ,</l>
      <l n="59">“ Tough veal , my girls , the calf as old as I . ”</l>
      <l n="60">But joke on joke repeated changed his mind ;</l>
      <l n="61">So up he took , at last , his son behind .</l>
      <l n="62">Not thirty yards ahead , another set</l>
      <l n="63">Found fault . “ The biggest fools I ever met , ”</l>
      <l n="64">Says one of them , “ such burdens to impose .</l>
      <l n="65">The ass is faint , and dying with their blows .</l>
      <l n="66">Is this , indeed , the mercy which these rustics</l>
      <l n="67">Show to their honest , faithful , old domestics ?</l>
      <l n="68">If to the fair these lazy fellows ride ,</l>
      <l n="69">‘ Twill be to sell thereat the donkey 's hide ! ”</l>
      <l n="70">“ Zounds ! ” cried the miller , “ precious little brains</l>
      <l n="71">Hath he who takes , to please the world , such pains ;</l>
      <l n="72">But since we 're in , we 'll try what can be done . ”</l>
      <l n="73">So off the ass they jump 'd , himself and son ,</l>
      <l n="74">And , like a prelate , donkey march 'd alone .</l>
      <l n="75">Another man they met . “ These folks , ” said he ,</l>
      <l n="76">“ Enslave themselves to let their ass go free —</l>
      <l n="77">The darling brute ! If I might be so bold ,</l>
      <l n="78">I 'd counsel them to have him set in gold .</l>
      <l n="79">Not so went Nicholas his Jane<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>to woo ,</l>
      <l n="80">Who rode , we sing , his ass to save his shoe . ”</l>
      <l n="81">“ Ass ! ass ! ” our man replied ; “ we 're asses three !</l>
      <l n="82">I do avow myself an ass to be ;</l>

      <l n="159">The wearers of the fleece</l>
      <l n="160">And wolves at last made peace ;</l>
      <l n="161">Which both appear 'd the better for ;</l>
      <l n="162">For if the wolves had now and then</l>
      <l n="163">Eat up a straggling ewe or wether ,</l>
      <l n="164">As often had the shepherd men</l>
      <l n="165">Turn 'd wolf-skins into leather .</l>
      <l n="166">Fear always spoil 'd the verdant herbage ,</l>
      <l n="167">And so it did the bloody carnage .</l>
      <l n="168">Hence peace was sweet ; and , lest it should be riven ,</l>
      <l n="169">On both sides hostages were given .</l>
      <l n="170">The sheep , as by the terms arranged ,</l>
      <l n="171">For pups of wolves their dogs exchanged ;</l>
      <l n="172">Which being done above suspicion ,</l>
      <l n="173">Confirm 'd and seal 'd by high commission ,</l>
      <l n="174">What time the pups were fully grown ,</l>
      <l n="175">And felt an appetite for prey ,</l>
      <l n="176">And saw the sheepfold left alone ,</l>
      <l n="177">The shepherds all away ,</l>
      <l n="178">They seized the fattest lambs they could ,</l>
      <l n="179">And , choking , dragg 'd them to the wood ;</l>
      <l n="180">Of which , by secret means apprised ,</l>
      <l n="181">Their sires , as is surmised ,</l>
      <l n="182">Fell on the hostage guardians of the sheep ,</l>
      <l n="183">And slew them all asleep .</l>
      <l n="184">So quick the deed of perfidy was done ,</l>
      <l n="185">There fled to tell the tale not one !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="186">From which we may conclude</l>

     <l n="24">This joke was truly out of season ;—</l>

     <l n="19">Outside their hiding-places ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thus shunning all pursuit ; whereat</l>
     <l n="21">Our crafty General Cat</l>

     <l n="23">Beside the wall with downward head ,</l>
     <l n="24">Resisting gravitation 's laws</l>
     <l n="25">By clinging with his hinder claws</l>

     <l n="33">With hope elated all</l>

     <l n="35">They thrust their noses out in air ;</l>
     <l n="36">And now to show their heads they dare ;</l>
     <l n="37">Now dodging back , now venturing more ;</l>
     <l n="38">At last upon the larder 's store</l>
     <l n="39">They fall to filching , as of yore .</l>
     <l n="40">A scanty feast enjoy 'd these shallows ;</l>
     <l n="41">Down dropp 'd the hung one from his gallows ,</l>
     <l n="42">And of the hindmost caught .</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Some other tricks to me are known , ’</l>

     <l n="47">That from your holes you shall come out . ’</l>

      <l n="108">I think him a wizard . A wizard ! the coot !</l>
      <l n="109">I 'd catch him if he were a devil to boot ! ’</l>
      <l n="110">The lord said , in haste to have sport for his hounds ,</l>
      <l n="111">‘ I 'll clear him , I warrant you , out of your grounds ;</l>

      <l n="116">Arrived , said the lord in his jovial mood ,</l>
      <l n="117">‘ We 'll breakfast with you , if your chickens are good .</l>

      <l n="122">So saying , the daughter he graciously greeted ,</l>

      <l n="127">Repell 'd with a modest and lady-like air ,—</l>
      <l n="128">So much that her father a little suspected</l>

      <l n="130">Meanwhile in the kitchen what bustling and cooking !</l>
      <l n="131">‘ For what are your hams ? They are very good looking . ’</l>
      <l n="132">‘ They 're kept for your lordship . ’ ‘ I take them , ’ said he ;</l>
      <l n="133">‘ Such elegant flitches are welcome to me . ’</l>
      <l n="134">He breakfasted finely his troop , with delight ,—</l>
      <l n="135">Dogs , horses , and grooms of the best appetite .</l>
      <l n="136">Thus he govern 'd his host in the shape of a guest ,</l>
      <l n="137">Unbottled his wine , and his daughter caress 'd .</l>

      <l n="143">The worst is , his garden most wofully fares ;</l>
      <l n="144">Adieu to its arbours , and borders , and squares ;</l>
      <l n="145">Adieu to its chiccory , onions , and leeks ;</l>

He asked to be allowed to play a tune ; and as soon as he had finished he threw himself into the sea . It was then found that the music had attracted a number of dolphins round the ship , and one of these took the bard on its back and conveyed him safely to Taenarus .</p>

     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="295">A stag took refuge from the chase</l>
      <l n="296">Among the oxen of a stable ,</l>
      <l n="297">Who counsel 'd him , as saith the fable ,</l>
      <l n="298">To seek at once some safer place .</l>
      <l n="299">‘ My brothers , ’ said the fugitive ,</l>
      <l n="300">‘ Betray me not , and , as I live ,</l>
      <l n="301">The richest pasture I will show ,</l>
      <l n="302">That e'er was grazed on , high or low ;</l>
      <l n="303">Your kindness you will not regret ,</l>
      <l n="304">For well some day I 'll pay the debt . ’</l>
      <l n="305">The oxen promised secrecy .</l>
      <l n="306">Down crouch 'd the stag , and breathed more free .</l>
      <l n="307">At eventide they brought fresh hay ,</l>
      <l n="308">As was their custom day by day ;</l>
      <l n="309">And often came the servants near ,</l>
      <l n="310">As did indeed the overseer ,</l>
      <l n="311">But with so little thought or care ,</l>
      <l n="312">That neither horns , nor hide , nor hair</l>
      <l n="313">Reveal 'd to them the stag was there .</l>
      <l n="314">Already thank 'd the wild-wood stranger</l>
      <l n="315">The oxen for their treatment kind ,</l>
      <l n="316">And there to wait made up his mind ,</l>
      <l n="317">Till he might issue free from danger .</l>
      <l n="318">Replied an ox that chew 'd the cud ,</l>
      <l n="319">‘ Your case looks fairly in the bud ;</l>
      <l n="320">But then I fear the reason why</l>
      <l n="321">Is , that the man of sharpest eye</l>
      <l n="322">Hath not yet come his look to take .</l>
      <l n="323">I dread his coming , for your sake ;</l>
      <l n="324">Your boasting may be premature :</l>
      <l n="325">Till then , poor stag , you 're not secure . ’</l>
      <l n="326">‘ Twas but a little while before</l>
      <l n="327">The careful master oped the door .</l>
      <l n="328">‘ How 's this , my boys ? ’ said he ;</l>
      <l n="329">‘ These empty racks will never do .</l>
      <l n="330">Go , change this dirty litter too .</l>
      <l n="331">More care than this I want to see</l>
      <l n="332">Of oxen that belong to me .</l>
      <l n="333">Well , Jim , my boy , you 're young and stout ;</l>
      <l n="334">What would it cost to clear these cobwebs out ?</l>
      <l n="335">And put these yokes , and hames , and traces ,</l>
      <l n="336">All as they should be , in their places ? ’</l>
      <l n="337">Thus looking round , he came to see</l>
      <l n="338">One head he did not usually .</l>
      <l n="339">The stag is found ; his foes</l>
      <l n="340">Deal heavily their blows .</l>
      <l n="341">Down sinks he in the strife ;</l>
      <l n="342">No tears can save his life .</l>
      <l n="343">They slay , and dress , and salt the beast ,</l>
      <l n="344">And cook his flesh in many a feast ,</l>
      <l n="345">And many a neighbour gets a taste .</l>
      <l n="346">As Phaedrus says it , pithily ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="350">“ Depend upon yourself alone , ”</l>
      <l n="351">Has to a common proverb grown .</l>
      <l n="352">‘ Tis thus confirm 'd in Aesop 's way :—</l>
      <l n="353">The larks to build their nests are seen</l>
      <l n="354">Among the wheat-crops young and green ;</l>
      <l n="355">That is to say ,</l>
      <l n="356">What time all things , dame Nature heeding ,</l>
      <l n="357">Betake themselves to love and breeding —</l>
      <l n="358">The monstrous whales and sharks ,</l>
      <l n="359">Beneath the briny flood ,</l>
      <l n="360">The tigers in the wood ,</l>
      <l n="361">And in the fields , the larks .</l>
      <l n="362">One she , however , of these last ,</l>
      <l n="363">Found more than half the spring-time past</l>
      <l n="364">Without the taste of spring-time pleasures ;</l>
      <l n="365">When firmly she set up her will</l>
      <l n="366">That she would be a mother still ,</l>
      <l n="367">And resolutely took her measures ;—</l>
      <l n="368">First , got herself by Hymen match 'd ;</l>
      <l n="369">Then built her nest , laid , sat , and hatch 'd .</l>
      <l n="370">All went as well as such things could .</l>
      <l n="371">The wheat-crop ripening ere the brood</l>
      <l n="372">Were strong enough to take their flight ,</l>
      <l n="373">Aware how perilous their plight ,</l>
      <l n="374">The lark went out to search for food ,</l>
      <l n="375">And told her young to listen well ,</l>
      <l n="376">And keep a constant sentinel .</l>
      <l n="377">‘ The owner of this field , ’ said she ,</l>
      <l n="378">‘ Will come , I know , his grain to see .</l>
      <l n="379">Hear all he says ; we little birds</l>
      <l n="380">Must shape our conduct by his words . ’</l>
      <l n="381">No sooner was the lark away ,</l>
      <l n="382">Than came the owner with his son .</l>
      <l n="383">‘ This wheat is ripe , ’ said he : ‘ now run</l>
      <l n="384">And give our friends a call</l>
      <l n="385">To bring their sickles all ,</l>
      <l n="386">And help us , great and small ,</l>
      <l n="387">To-morrow , at the break of day . ’</l>
      <l n="388">The lark , returning , found no harm ,</l>
      <l n="389">Except her nest in wild alarm .</l>
      <l n="390">Says one , ‘ We heard the owner say ,</l>
      <l n="391">Go , give our friends a call</l>
      <l n="392">To help , to-morrow , break of day . ’</l>
      <l n="393">Replied the lark , ‘ If that is all ,</l>
      <l n="394">We need not be in any fear ,</l>
      <l n="395">But only keep an open ear .</l>
      <l n="396">As gay as larks , now eat your victuals .— ’</l>
      <l n="397">They ate and slept — the great and littles .</l>
      <l n="398">The dawn arrives , but not the friends ;</l>
      <l n="399">The lark soars up , the owner wends</l>
      <l n="400">His usual round to view his land .</l>
      <l n="401">‘ This grain , ’ says he , ‘ ought not to stand .</l>
      <l n="402">Our friends do wrong ; and so does he</l>
      <l n="403">Who trusts that friends will friendly be .</l>
      <l n="404">My son , go call our kith and kin</l>
      <l n="405">To help us get our harvest in . ’</l>
      <l n="406">This second order made</l>
      <l n="407">The little larks still more afraid .</l>
      <l n="408">‘ He sent for kindred , mother , by his son ;</l>
      <l n="409">The work will now , indeed , be done . ’</l>
      <l n="410">‘ No , darlings ; go to sleep ;</l>
      <l n="411">Our lowly nest we 'll keep . ’</l>
      <l n="412">With reason said ; for kindred there came none .</l>
      <l n="413">Thus , tired of expectation vain ,</l>
      <l n="414">Once more the owner view 'd his grain .</l>
      <l n="415">‘ My son , ’ said he , ‘ we 're surely fools</l>
      <l n="416">To wait for other people 's tools ;</l>
      <l n="417">As if one might , for love or pelf ,</l>
      <l n="418">Have friends more faithful than himself !</l>
      <l n="419">Engrave this lesson deep , my son .</l>
      <l n="420">And know you now what must be done ?</l>
      <l n="421">We must ourselves our sickles bring ,</l>
      <l n="422">And , while the larks their matins sing ,</l>
      <l n="423">Begin the work ; and , on this plan ,</l>
      <l n="424">Get in our harvest as we can . ’</l>
      <l n="425">This plan the lark no sooner knew ,</l>
      <l n="426">Than , ‘ Now 's the time , ’ she said , ‘ my chicks ; ’</l>
      <l n="427">And , taking little time to fix ,</l>
      <l n="428">Away they flew ;</l>
      <l n="429">All fluttering , soaring , often grounding ,</l>
      <l n="430">Decamp 'd without a trumpet sounding .</l>

      <l n="28">The face of vanity purblind</l>
      <l n="29">With that of restless envy join 'd ;</l>

      <l n="48">A man that labour 'd in the wood</l>
      <l n="49">Had lost his honest livelihood ;</l>

      <l n="58">And it shall strike good blows for thee . ’</l>
      <l n="59">His prayer in high Olympus heard ,</l>

      <l n="73">As due reward of honesty . ’</l>
      <l n="74">This luck when neighbouring choppers knew ,</l>
      <l n="75">They lost their axes , not a few ,</l>
      <l n="76">And sent their prayers to Jupiter</l>

      <l n="78">His winged son , however , sent</l>
      <l n="79">With gold and silver axes , went .</l>
      <l n="80">Each would have thought himself a fool</l>

      <l n="32">Which he suspected as the thieves ,</l>
      <l n="33">He set his trap among the leaves ;</l>
      <l n="34">And , ere he left the place ,</l>
      <l n="35">He thus invoked celestial grace :—</l>
      <l n="36">‘ O king of all the powers divine ,</l>
      <l n="37">Against the rogue but grant me this delight ,</l>
      <l n="38">That this my trap may catch him in my sight ,</l>
      <l n="39">And I , from twenty calves of mine ,</l>
      <l n="40">Will make the fattest thine . ’</l>
      <l n="41">But while the words were on his tongue ,</l>
      <l n="42">Forth came a lion great and strong .</l>
      <l n="43">Down crouch 'd the man of sheep , and said ,</l>
      <l n="44">With shivering fright half dead ,</l>
      <l n="45">‘ Alas ! that man should never be aware</l>
      <l n="46">Of what may be the meaning of his prayer !</l>
      <l n="47">To catch the robber of my flocks ,</l>

      <l n="107">What inventories , cares , and worry !</l>
      <l n="108">What wear of temper and of health !</l>
      <l n="109">Both lived in constant , slavish hurry .</l>
      <l n="110">Thieves took by plot , and lords by loan ;</l>
      <l n="111">The king by tax , the poor by tone .</l>
      <l n="112">Thus felt the curses which</l>
      <l n="113">Arise from being rich ,—</l>
      <l n="114">‘ Remove this affluence ! ’ they pray ;</l>
      <l n="115">The poor are happier than they</l>

      <l n="127">With those who waste in such vain prayers</l>
      <l n="128">The time required by their affairs .</l>
      <l n="129">The goblin laugh 'd , and so did they .</l>
      <l n="130">However , ere he went away ,</l>
      <l n="131">To profit by his offer kind ,</l>
      <l n="132">They ask 'd for wisdom , wealth of mind ,—</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>This fable is founded upon a fact , which is related by Madame de Sévigné in her Letters under date Feb. 26 , 1672 , as follows :— “ M. Boufflers has killed a man since his death : the circumstance was this : they were carrying him about a league from Boufflers to inter him ; the corpse was on a bier in a coach ; his own curate attended it ; the coach overset , and the bier falling upon the curate 's neck choaked him . ” M. de Boufflers had fallen down dead a few days before . He was the eldest brother of the Duke de Boufflers . In another Letter , March 3 , 1672 , Madame de Sévigné says :— “ Here is Fontaine 's fable too , on the adventure of M. de Boufflers ’ curate , who was killed in the coach by his dead patron . There was something very extraordinary in the affair itself : the fable is pretty ; but not to be compared to the one that follows it : I do not understand the Milk-pot . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>This allusion to the preceding fable must be the “ milk-pot ” which Madame de Sévigné did “ not understand ” ( vide last note ) ; Madame can hardly have meant the “ milk-pot ” fable , which is easily understood . She often saw La Fontaine 's work before it was published , and the date of her letter quoted at p. 161 shows that she must so have seen the “ Curate and the Corpse , ” and that , perhaps , without so seeing the “ Dairywoman and the Pot of Milk . ”</p>

Sir Paul Neal , whose lapsus suggested this fable , thought he had discovered an animal in the moon . Unluckily , however , after having made his “ discovery ” known , it was found that the ground of it was simply the accidental presence of a mouse in the object-glass of his telescope .

The European powers then found themselves exhausted by wars , and desirous of peace . England , the only neutral , became , of course , the arbiter of the negotiations which ensued at Nimeguen . All the belligerent parties invoked her mediation . Charles II ., however , felt himself exceedingly embarrassed by his secret connections with Louis XIV ., which made him desire to prescribe conditions favourable to that monarch ; while , on the other hand , he feared the people of England , if , treacherous to her interests , he should fail to favour the nations allied and combined against France .— Translator .

      <l n="77">His neighbour , on the other hand ,</l>
      <l n="78">With gold in plenty at command ,</l>
      <l n="79">But little sang , and slumber 'd less —</l>
      <l n="80">A financier of great success .</l>
      <l n="81">If e'er he dozed , at break of day ,</l>
      <l n="82">The cobbler 's song drove sleep away ;</l>

      <l n="85">In market sold , like food and drink ,</l>
      <l n="86">So much an hour , so much a wink .</l>
      <l n="87">At last , our songster did he call</l>

      <l n="97">Content with daily bread . ’</l>
      <l n="98">‘ Indeed ! Well , Gregory , pray ,</l>
      <l n="99">What may your earnings be per day ? ’</l>
      <l n="100">‘ Why , sometimes more and sometimes less .</l>

      <l n="107">They tread upon each other 's heels ,</l>
      <l n="108">Those idle days of holy saints !</l>

      <l n="117">They 'll long supply your every need . ’</l>
      <l n="118">The cobbler thought the silver more</l>
      <l n="119">Than he had ever dream 'd before ,</l>
      <l n="120">The mines for ages could produce ,</l>
      <l n="121">Or world , with all its people , use .</l>
      <l n="122">He took it home , and there did hide —</l>
      <l n="123">And with it laid his joy aside .</l>
      <l n="124">No more of song , no more of sleep ,</l>
      <l n="125">But cares , suspicions in their stead ,</l>
      <l n="126">And false alarms , by fancy fed .</l>
      <l n="127">His eyes and ears their vigils keep ,</l>
      <l n="128">And not a cat can tread the floor</l>
      <l n="129">But seems a thief slipp 'd through the door .</l>
      <l n="130">At last , poor man !</l>
      <l n="131">Up to the financier he ran ,—</l>
      <l n="132">Then in his morning nap profound :</l>
      <l n="133">‘ O , give me back my songs , ’ cried he ,</l>
      <l n="134">‘ And sleep , that used so sweet to be ,</l>
      <l n="135">And take the money , every pound ! ’</l>

     <l n="5">The mouse , indeed , was sadly bruised .</l>
     <l n="6">Although , as neighbours , we are used</l>
     <l n="7">To be more kind to many others ,</l>
     <l n="8">The Brahmins treat the mice as brothers .</l>
     <l n="9">The notion haunts their heads , that when</l>
     <l n="10">The soul goes forth from dying men ,</l>
     <l n="11">It enters worm , or bird , or beast ,</l>
     <l n="12">As Providence or Fate is pleased ;</l>
     <l n="13">And on this mystery rests their law ,</l>
     <l n="14">Which from Pythagoras they 're said to draw .</l>
     <l n="15">And hence the Brahmin kindly pray 'd</l>
     <l n="16">To one who knew the wizard 's trade ,</l>
     <l n="17">To give the creature , wounded sore ,</l>
     <l n="18">The form in which it lodged before .</l>
     <l n="19">Forthwith the mouse became a maid ,</l>
     <l n="20">Of years about fifteen ;</l>
     <l n="21">A lovelier was never seen .</l>
     <l n="22">She would have waked , I ween ,</l>
     <l n="23">In Priam 's son , a fiercer flame</l>
     <l n="24">Than did the beauteous Grecian dame .</l>
     <l n="25">Surprised at such a novelty ,</l>
     <l n="26">The Brahmin to the damsel cried ,</l>
     <l n="27">‘ Your choice is free ;</l>
     <l n="28">For every he</l>
     <l n="29">Will seek you for his bride . ’</l>
     <l n="30">Said she , ‘ Am I to have a voice ?</l>
     <l n="31">The strongest , then , shall be my choice . ’</l>
     <l n="32">‘ O sun ! ’ the Brahmin cried , ‘ this maid is thine ,</l>
     <l n="33">And thou shalt be a son-in-law of mine . ’</l>
     <l n="34">‘ No , ’ said the sun , ‘ this murky cloud , it seems ,</l>
     <l n="35">In strength exceeds me , since he hides my beams ;</l>
     <l n="36">And him I counsel you to take . ’</l>
     <l n="37">Again the reverend Brahmin spake —</l>
     <l n="38">‘ O cloud , on-flying with thy stores of water ,</l>
     <l n="39">Pray wast thou born to wed my daughter ? ’</l>
     <l n="40">‘ Ah , no , alas ! for , you may see ,</l>
     <l n="41">The wind is far too strong for me .</l>
     <l n="42">My claims with Boreas ’ to compare ,</l>
     <l n="43">I must confess , I do not dare . ’</l>
     <l n="44">‘ O wind , ’ then cried the Brahmin , vex 'd ,</l>
     <l n="45">And wondering what would hinder next ,—</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Approach , and , with thy sweetest air ,</l>
     <l n="47">Embrace — possess — the fairest fair . ’</l>
     <l n="48">The wind , enraptured , thither blew ;—</l>
     <l n="49">A mountain stopp 'd him as he flew ,</l>
     <l n="50">To him now pass 'd the tennis-ball ,</l>
     <l n="51">And from him to a creature small .</l>
     <l n="52">Said he , ‘ I 'd wed the maid , but that</l>
     <l n="53">I 've had a quarrel with the rat .</l>
     <l n="54">A fool were I to take the bride</l>
     <l n="55">From one so sure to pierce my side . ’</l>
     <l n="56">The rat ! It thrill 'd the damsel 's ear ;</l>
     <l n="57">To name at once seem 'd sweet and dear .</l>
     <l n="58">The rat ! ‘ Twas one of Cupid 's blows ;</l>

Molière 's “ George Dandin ” ( produced 1664 ) , may also have helped La Fontaine to the name . The last-mentioned character is a farmer , but , like the others , he is a species of incapable ; and the word dandin in the old French dictionaries is given as signifying inaptness or incapacity .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>The oyster and lawyer story is also treated in Fable XXI ., Book I .

      <l n="150">In firm , united , fearless band ,</l>
      <l n="151">By which they might expel him from their land .</l>
      <l n="152">Upon their faith , they would not flinch ,</l>
      <l n="153">They promised him , a single inch .</l>
      <l n="154">‘ We 'll choke , ’ said they , ‘ the murderous glutton</l>

      <l n="156">Their lives they pledged against the beast ,</l>
      <l n="157">And Willy gave them all a feast .</l>
      <l n="158">But evil Fate , than Phoebus faster ,</l>
      <l n="159">Ere night had brought a new disaster :</l>
      <l n="160">A wolf there came . By nature 's law ,</l>

      <l n="2">You , Iris , ‘ twere an easy task to praise ;</l>
      <l n="3">But you refuse the incense of my lays .</l>
      <l n="4">In this you are unlike all other mortals ,</l>
      <l n="5">Who welcome all the praise that seeks their portals ;</l>
      <l n="6">Not one who is not soothed by sound so sweet .</l>
      <l n="7">For me to blame this humour were not meet ,</l>
      <l n="8">By gods and mortals shared in common ,</l>
      <l n="9">And , in the main , by lovely woman .</l>
      <l n="10">That drink , so vaunted by the rhyming trade ,</l>
      <l n="11">That cheers the god who deals the thunder-blow ,</l>
      <l n="12">And oft intoxicates the gods below ,—</l>
      <l n="13">The nectar , Iris , is of praises made .</l>
      <l n="14">You taste it not . But , in its place ,</l>
      <l n="15">Wit , science , even trifles grace</l>
      <l n="16">Your bill of fare ; but , for that matter ,</l>
      <l n="17">The world will not believe the latter .</l>
      <l n="18">Well , leave the world in unbelief .</l>
      <l n="19">Still science , trifles , fancies light as air ,</l>
      <l n="20">I hold , should mingle in a bill of fare ,</l>
      <l n="21">Each giving each its due relief ;</l>
      <l n="22">As , where the gifts of Flora fall ,</l>
      <l n="23">On different flowers we see</l>
      <l n="24">Alight the busy bee ,</l>
      <l n="25">Educing sweet from all .</l>
      <l n="26">Thus much premised , do n't think it strange ,</l>
      <l n="27">Or aught beyond my muse 's range ,</l>
      <l n="28">If e'en my fables should infold ,</l>
      <l n="29">Among their nameless trumpery ,</l>
      <l n="30">The traits of a philosophy</l>
      <l n="31">Far-famed as subtle , charming , bold .</l>
      <l n="32">They call it new — the men of wit ;</l>
      <l n="33">Perhaps you have not heard of it ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
      <l n="34">My verse will tell you what it means :—</l>
      <l n="35">They say that beasts are mere machines ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
      <l n="36">That , in their doings , everything</l>
      <l n="37">Is done by virtue of a spring —</l>
      <l n="38">No sense , no soul , nor notion ;</l>
      <l n="39">But matter merely ,— set in motion ,</l>
      <l n="40">Just such the watch in kind ,</l>
      <l n="41">Which joggeth on , to purpose blind .</l>
      <l n="42">Now ope , and read within its breast —</l>
      <l n="43">The place of soul is by its wheels possess 'd .</l>
      <l n="44">One moves a second , that a third ,</l>
      <l n="45">Till finally its sound is heard .</l>
      <l n="46">And now the beast , our sages say ,</l>
      <l n="47">Is moved precisely in this way</l>
      <l n="48">An object strikes it in a certain place :</l>
      <l n="49">The spot thus struck , without a moment 's space ,</l>
      <l n="50">To neighbouring parts the news conveys ;</l>
      <l n="51">Thus sense receives it through the chain ,</l>
      <l n="52">And takes impression .— How ? Explain .—</l>
      <l n="53">Not I . They say , by sheer necessity ,</l>
      <l n="54">From will as well as passion free ,</l>
      <l n="55">The animal is found the thrall</l>
      <l n="56">Of movements which the vulgar call</l>
      <l n="57">Joy , sadness , pleasure , pain , and love —</l>
      <l n="58">The cause extrinsic and above .—</l>
      <l n="59">Believe it not . What 's this I hold ?</l>
      <l n="60">Why , sooth , it is a watch of gold —</l>
      <l n="61">Its life , the mere unbending of a spring .</l>
      <l n="62">And we ?— are quite a different thing .</l>
      <l n="63">Hear how Descartes — Descartes , whom all applaud ,</l>
      <l n="64">Whom pagans would have made a god ,</l>
      <l n="65">Who holds , in fact , the middle place</l>
      <l n="66">‘ Twixt ours and the celestial race ,</l>
      <l n="67">About as does the plodding ass</l>
      <l n="68">From man to oyster as you pass —</l>
      <l n="69">Hear how this author states the case</l>
      <l n="70">‘ Of all the tribes to being brought</l>
      <l n="71">By our Creator out of nought ,</l>
      <l n="72">I only have the gift of thought . ’</l>
      <l n="73">Now , Iris , you will recollect</l>
      <l n="74">We were by older science taught</l>
      <l n="75">That when brutes think , they do n't reflect .</l>
      <l n="76">Descartes proceeds beyond the wall ,</l>
      <l n="77">And says they do not think at all .</l>
      <l n="78">This you believe with ease ;</l>
      <l n="79">And so could I , if I should please .</l>
      <l n="80">Still , in the forest , when , from morn</l>
      <l n="81">Till midday , sounds of dog and horn</l>
      <l n="82">Have terrified the stag forlorn ;</l>
      <l n="83">When he has doubled forth and back ,</l>
      <l n="84">And labour 'd to confound his track ,</l>
      <l n="85">Till tired and spent with efforts vain —</l>
      <l n="86">An ancient stag , of antlers ten ;—</l>
      <l n="87">He puts a younger in his place ,</l>
      <l n="88">All fresh , to weary out the chase .—</l>
      <l n="89">What thoughts for one that merely grazes !</l>
      <l n="90">The doublings , turnings , windings , mazes ,</l>
      <l n="91">The substituting fresher bait ,</l>
      <l n="92">Were worthy of a man of state —</l>
      <l n="93">And worthy of a better fate !</l>
      <l n="94">To yield to rascal dogs his breath</l>
      <l n="95">Is all the honour of his death .</l>
      <l n="96">And when the partridge danger spies ,</l>
      <l n="97">Before her brood have strength to rise ,</l>
      <l n="98">She wisely counterfeits a wound ,</l>
      <l n="99">And drags her wing upon the ground —</l>
      <l n="100">Thus , from her home , beside some ancient log ,</l>
      <l n="101">Safe drawing off the sportsman and his dog ;</l>
      <l n="102">And while the latter seems to seize her ,</l>
      <l n="103">The victim of an easy chase —</l>
      <l n="104">‘ Your teeth are not for such as me , sir , ’</l>
      <l n="105">She cries ,</l>
      <l n="106">And flies ,</l>
      <l n="107">And laughs the former in his face .</l>

      <l n="108">Far north , ‘ tis said , the people live</l>
      <l n="109">In customs nearly primitive ;</l>

      <l n="111">In ignorance profound :—</l>
      <l n="112">I mean the people human ;</l>
      <l n="113">For animals are dwelling there</l>
      <l n="114">With skill such buildings to prepare</l>

      <l n="117">Their work withstands its mighty force ,</l>
      <l n="118">So damming it from shore to shore ,</l>
      <l n="119">That , gliding smoothly o'er ,</l>
      <l n="120">In even sheets the waters pour .</l>
      <l n="121">Their work , as it proceeds , they grade and bevel ,</l>
      <l n="122">Or bring it up to plumb or level ;</l>
      <l n="123">First lay their logs , and then with mortar smear ,</l>
      <l n="124">As if directed by an engineer .</l>
      <l n="125">Each labours for the public good ;</l>
      <l n="126">The old command , the youthful brood</l>
      <l n="127">Cut down , and shape , and place the wood .</l>
      <l n="128">Compared with theirs , e'en Plato 's model state</l>
      <l n="129">Were but the work of some apprentice pate .</l>
      <l n="130">Such are the beaver folks , who know</l>
      <l n="131">Enough to house themselves from snow ,</l>

      <l n="133">Meanwhile , our kinsmen are such fools ,</l>
      <l n="134">In spite of their example ,</l>
      <l n="135">They dwell in huts less ample ,</l>
      <l n="136">And cross the streams by swimming ,</l>
      <l n="137">However cold and brimming !</l>
      <l n="138">Now that the skilful beaver ,</l>
      <l n="139">Is but a body void of spirit ,</l>

      <l n="187">Just as at first it did , in fact ,</l>
      <l n="188">By neither thought nor reason back 'd .</l>
      <l n="189">Not so with us , beasts perpendicular ;</l>

      <l n="191">Self-ruled by independent mind ,</l>
      <l n="192">We 're not the sport of objects blind ,</l>

      <l n="232">Two rats in foraging fell on an egg ,—</l>

      <l n="236">Brimful of joy and appetite ,</l>

      <l n="239">When suddenly there came in sight</l>
      <l n="240">A personage — Sir Pullet Fox .</l>

     <l n="5">On this the animal perverse</l>
     <l n="6">( I mean the snake ;</l>
     <l n="7">Pray do n't mistake</l>
     <l n="8">The human for the worse )</l>
     <l n="9">Was caught and bagg 'd , and , worst of all ,</l>
     <l n="10">His blood was by his captor to be spilt</l>
     <l n="11">Without regard to innocence or guilt .</l>
     <l n="12">Howe'er , to show the why , these words let fall</l>
     <l n="13">His judge and jailor , proud and tall :—</l>
     <l n="14">‘ Thou type of all ingratitude !</l>
     <l n="15">All charity to hearts like thine</l>

     <l n="38">By such a lecture somewhat foil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="39">The other back a step recoil 'd ,</l>

     <l n="46">The snake agreed ; they to a cow referr 'd it .</l>
     <l n="47">Who , being called , came graciously and heard it .</l>

     <l n="49">‘ In such a case , to call on me ?</l>
     <l n="50">The adder 's right , plain truth to bellow ;</l>
     <l n="51">For years I 've nursed this haughty fellow ,</l>

     <l n="54">For him my milk has had to flow ,</l>
     <l n="55">My calves , at tender age , to die .</l>
     <l n="56">And for this best of wealth ,</l>

     <l n="63">And now my fate is surely sadder</l>
     <l n="64">Than if my master were an adder ,</l>
     <l n="65">With brains within the latitude</l>
     <l n="66">Of such immense ingratitude .</l>
     <l n="67">This , gentles , is my honest view ;</l>

     <l n="73">Let 's trust the ox . ’ ‘ Let 's trust , ’ replied</l>
     <l n="74">The crawling beast , well gratified .</l>
     <l n="75">So said , so done ;</l>
     <l n="76">The ox , with tardy pace , came on</l>
     <l n="77">And , ruminating o'er the case ,</l>
     <l n="78">Declared , with very serious face ,</l>
     <l n="79">That years of his most painful toil</l>
     <l n="80">Had clothed with Ceres ’ gifts our soil —</l>
     <l n="81">Her gifts to men — but always sold</l>
     <l n="82">To beasts for higher cost than gold ;</l>
     <l n="83">And that for this , for his reward ,</l>
     <l n="84">More blows than thanks return 'd his lord ;</l>
     <l n="85">And then , when age had chill 'd his blood ,</l>
     <l n="86">And men would quell the wrath of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="87">Out must be pour 'd the vital flood ,</l>
     <l n="88">For others ’ sins , all thankless given .</l>
     <l n="89">So spake the ox ; and then the man :—</l>

     <l n="91">Instead of judge , it is his plan</l>
     <l n="92">To play accuser and defamer . ’</l>
     <l n="93">A tree was next the arbitrator ,</l>
     <l n="94">And made the wrong of man still greater .</l>
     <l n="95">It served as refuge from the heat ,</l>
     <l n="96">The showers , and storms which madly beat ;</l>
     <l n="97">It grew our gardens ’ greatest pride ,</l>
     <l n="98">Its shadow spreading far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="99">And bow 'd itself with fruit beside :</l>
     <l n="100">But yet a mercenary clown</l>
     <l n="101">With cruel iron chopp 'd it down .</l>
     <l n="102">Behold the recompense for which ,</l>
     <l n="103">Year after year , it did enrich ,</l>
     <l n="104">With spring 's sweet flowers , and autumn 's fruits ,</l>
     <l n="105">And summer 's shade , both men and brutes ,</l>
     <l n="106">And warm 'd the hearth with many a limb</l>
     <l n="107">Which winter from its top did trim !</l>
     <l n="108">Why could not man have pruned and spared ,</l>
     <l n="109">And with itself for ages shared ?—</l>
     <l n="110">Much scorning thus to be convinced ,</l>
     <l n="111">The man resolved his cause to gain .</l>
     <l n="112">Quoth he , ‘ My goodness is evinced</l>
     <l n="113">By hearing this , ‘ tis very plain ; ’</l>
     <l n="114">Then flung the serpent bag and all ,</l>
     <l n="115">With fatal force , against a wall .</l>

     <l n="121">If one should dare the fact dispute ,</l>

     <l n="2">While watching man in all his phases ,</l>

     <l n="4">He acts just like the brute creation ,—</l>
     <l n="5">I 've thought the lord of all these races</l>

      <l n="1">Some time ago , a sultan Leopard ,</l>

      <l n="6">Full many a sheep upon the plains ,</l>
      <l n="7">That lay within his wide domains .</l>
      <l n="8">Not far away , one morn ,</l>
      <l n="9">There was a lion born .</l>
      <l n="10">Exchanged high compliments of state ,</l>
      <l n="11">As is the custom with the great ,</l>
      <l n="12">The sultan call 'd his vizier Fox ,</l>
      <l n="13">Who had a deeper knowledge-box ,</l>
      <l n="14">And said to him , ‘ This lion 's whelp you dread ;</l>

      <l n="52">And three hath he , that cost him nought —</l>
      <l n="53">His courage , strength , and watchful thought .</l>
      <l n="54">Quick send a wether for his use :</l>
      <l n="55">If not contented , send him more ;</l>

      <l n="58">Thus save the rest . ’ — But such advice</l>

      <l n="103">Pray quit this wolfship , now you can ,</l>
      <l n="104">And leave the woods an honest man . ’</l>
      <l n="105">‘ But is there one ? ’ the wolf replied :</l>
      <l n="106">‘ Such man , I own , I never spied .</l>
      <l n="107">You treat me as a ravenous beast ,</l>
      <l n="108">But what are you ? To say the least ,</l>
      <l n="109">You would yourself have eat the sheep ,</l>
      <l n="110">Which , eat by me , the village weep .</l>
      <l n="111">Now , truly , on your faith confess ,</l>
      <l n="112">Should I , as man , love flesh the less ?</l>

     <l n="3">There lived a cat ; from tenderest age ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of both , the basket and the cage</l>
     <l n="5">Had household gods the same .</l>
     <l n="6">The bird 's sharp beak full oft provoked the cat ,</l>
     <l n="7">Who play 'd in turn , but with a gentle pat ,</l>
     <l n="8">His wee friend sparing with a merry laugh ,</l>
     <l n="9">Not punishing his faults by half .</l>
     <l n="10">In short , he scrupled much the harm ,</l>

     <l n="15">Excused the warmth with which he play 'd :</l>
     <l n="16">For ‘ tis full half of friendship 's art</l>

     <l n="18">Familiar since they saw the light ,</l>
     <l n="19">Mere habit kept their friendship good ;</l>
     <l n="20">Fair play had never turn 'd to fight ,</l>
     <l n="21">Till , of their neighbourhood ,</l>
     <l n="22">Another sparrow came to greet</l>
     <l n="23">Old Ratto grave and saucy Pete .</l>
     <l n="24">Between the birds a quarrel rose ,</l>

     <l n="26">‘ A pretty stranger , with such blows</l>

     <l n="28">‘ A neighbour 's sparrow eating ours !</l>
     <l n="29">Not so , by all the feline powers . ’</l>
     <l n="30">And quick the stranger he devours .</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Now , truly , ’ saith Sir Cat ,</l>
     <l n="32">I know how sparrows taste by that .</l>
     <l n="33">Exquisite , tender , delicate ! ’</l>
     <l n="34">This thought soon seal 'd the other 's fate .—</l>
     <l n="35">But hence what moral can I bring ?</l>
     <l n="36">For , lacking that important thing ,</l>
     <l n="37">A fable lacks its finishing :</l>
     <l n="38">I seem to see of one some trace ,</l>

     <l n="40">Yours , prince , it will not thus abuse :</l>
     <l n="41">For you such sports , and not my muse .</l>
     <l n="42">In wit , she and her sisters eight</l>
     <l n="43">Would fail to match you with a mate .</l>

   <p>A temple I reserved you in my rhyme : It might not be completed but with time . Already its endurance I had grounded Upon this charming art , divinely founded ; And on the name of that divinity For whom its adoration was to be . These words I should have written o'er its gate — TO IRIS IS THIS PALACE CONSECRATE ; Not her who served the queen divine ; For Juno 's self , and he who crown 'd her bliss , Had thought it for their dignity , I wis , To bear the messages of mine . Within the dome the apotheosis Should greet th ’ enraptured sight — All heaven , in pomp and order meet , Conducting Iris to her seat Beneath a canopy of light ! The walls would amply serve to paint her life ,— A matter sweet , indeed , but little rife In those events , which , order 'd by the Fates , Cause birth , or change , or overthrow of states . The innermost should hold her image ,— Her features , smiles , attractions there ,— Her art of pleasing without care ,— Her loveliness , that 's sure of homage . Some mortals , kneeling at her feet ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>— Earth 's noblest heroes ,— should be seen ; Ay , demigods , and even gods , I ween : ( The worshipp 'd of the world thinks meet , Sometimes her altar to perfume . ) Her eyes , so far as that might be , Her soul 's rich jewel should illume ; Alas ! but how imperfectly ! For could a heart that throbb 'd to bless Its friends with boundless tenderness ,— Or could that heaven-descended mind Which , in its matchless beauty , join 'd The strength of man with woman 's grace ,— Be given to sculptor to express ? O Iris , who canst charm the soul — Nay , bind it with supreme control ,— Whom as myself I can but love ,— ( Nay , not that word : as I 'm a man , Your court has placed it under ban , And we 'll dismiss it ,) pray approve My filling up this hasty plan ! This sketch has here received a place , A simple anecdote to grace , Where friendship shows so sweet a face , That in its features you may find Somewhat accordant to your mind . Not that the tale may kings beseem ; But he who winneth your esteem Is not a monarch placed above The need and influence of love , But simple mortal , void of crown , That would for friends his life lay down — Than which I know no friendlier act . Four animals , in league compact , Are now to give our noble race A useful lesson in the case .</p>

     <l n="1">Rat , raven , tortoise , and gazelle ,</l>
     <l n="2">Once into firmest friendship fell .</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Twas in a home unknown to man</l>
     <l n="4">That they their happiness began .</l>
     <l n="5">But safe from man there 's no retreat :</l>
     <l n="6">Pierce you the loneliest wood ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or dive beneath the deepest flood ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or mount you where the eagles brood ,—</l>
     <l n="9">His secret ambuscade you meet .</l>
     <l n="10">The light gazelle , in harmless play ,</l>
     <l n="11">Amused herself abroad one day ,</l>
     <l n="12">When , by mischance , her track was found</l>
     <l n="13">And follow 'd by the baying hound —</l>
     <l n="14">That barbarous tool of barbarous man —</l>
     <l n="15">From which far , far away she ran .</l>
     <l n="16">At meal-time to the others</l>
     <l n="17">The rat observed ,— ‘ My brothers ,</l>
     <l n="18">How happens it that we</l>
     <l n="19">Are met to-day but three ?</l>
     <l n="20">Is Miss Gazelle so little steady ?</l>
     <l n="21">Hath she forgotten us already ? ’</l>
     <l n="22">Out cried the tortoise at the word ,—</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Were I , as Raven is , a bird ,</l>
     <l n="24">I 'd fly this instant from my seat ,</l>
     <l n="25">And learn what accident , and where ,</l>
     <l n="26">Hath kept away our sister fair ,—</l>
     <l n="27">Our sister of the flying feet ;</l>
     <l n="28">For of her heart , dear rat ,</l>
     <l n="29">It were a shame to doubt of that . ’</l>
     <l n="30">The raven flew ;</l>
     <l n="31">He spied afar ,— the face he knew ,—</l>
     <l n="32">The poor gazelle entangled in a snare ,</l>
     <l n="33">In anguish vainly floundering there .</l>
     <l n="34">Straight back he turn 'd , and gave the alarm ;</l>
     <l n="35">For to have ask 'd the sufferer now ,</l>
     <l n="36">The why and wherefore , when and how ,</l>
     <l n="37">She had incurr 'd so great a harm ,—</l>
     <l n="38">And lose in vain debate</l>
     <l n="39">The turning-point of fate ,</l>
     <l n="40">As would the master of a school ,—</l>
     <l n="41">He was by no means such a fool .<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span></l>
     <l n="42">On tidings of so sad a pith ,</l>
     <l n="43">The three their council held forthwith .</l>
     <l n="44">By two it was the vote</l>
     <l n="45">To hasten to the spot</l>
     <l n="46">Where lay the poor gazelle .</l>
     <l n="47">‘ Our friend here in his shell ,</l>
     <l n="48">I think , will do as well</l>
     <l n="49">To guard the house , ’ the raven said ;</l>
     <l n="50">‘ For , with his creeping pace ,</l>
     <l n="51">When would he reach the place ?</l>
     <l n="52">Not till the deer were dead . ’</l>
     <l n="53">Eschewing more debate ,</l>
     <l n="54">They flew to aid their mate ,</l>
     <l n="55">That luckless mountain roe .</l>
     <l n="56">The tortoise , too , resolved to go .</l>
     <l n="57">Behold him plodding on behind ,</l>
     <l n="58">And plainly cursing in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="59">The fate that left his legs to lack ,</l>
     <l n="60">And glued his dwelling to his back .</l>
     <l n="61">The snare was cut by Rongemail ,</l>
     <l n="62">( For so the rat they rightly hail ) .</l>
     <l n="63">Conceive their joy yourself you may .</l>
     <l n="64">Just then the hunter came that way ,</l>
     <l n="65">And , ‘ Who hath filch 'd my prey ? ’</l>
     <l n="66">Cried he , upon the spot</l>
     <l n="67">Where now his prey was not .—</l>
     <l n="68">A hole hid Rongemail ;</l>
     <l n="69">A tree the bird as well ;</l>
     <l n="70">The woods , the free gazelle .</l>
     <l n="71">The hunter , well nigh mad ,</l>
     <l n="72">To find no inkling could be had ,</l>
     <l n="73">Espied the tortoise in his path ,</l>
     <l n="74">And straightway check 'd his wrath .</l>
     <l n="75">‘ Why let my courage flag ,</l>
     <l n="76">Because my snare has chanced to miss ?</l>
     <l n="77">I 'll have a supper out of this . ’</l>
     <l n="78">He said , and put it in his bag .</l>
     <l n="79">And it had paid the forfeit so ,</l>
     <l n="80">Had not the raven told the roe ,</l>
     <l n="81">Who from her covert came ,</l>
     <l n="82">Pretending to be lame .</l>
     <l n="83">The man , right eager to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="84">Aside his wallet threw ,</l>
     <l n="85">Which Rongemail took care</l>
     <l n="86">To serve as he had done the snare ;</l>
     <l n="87">Thus putting to an end</l>
     <l n="88">The hunter 's supper on his friend .</l>
     <l n="89">‘ Tis thus sage Pilpay 's tale I follow .</l>
     <l n="90">Were I the ward of golden-hair 'd Apollo ,</l>
     <l n="91">It were , by favour of that god , easy —</l>
     <l n="92">And surely for your sake —</l>
     <l n="93">As long a tale to make</l>
     <l n="94">As is the Iliad or Odyssey .</l>
     <l n="95">Grey Rongemail the hero 's part should play ,</l>
     <l n="96">Though each would be as needful in his way .</l>
     <l n="97">He of the mansion portable awoke</l>
     <l n="98">Sir Raven by the words he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="99">To act the spy , and then the swift express .</l>
     <l n="100">The light gazelle alone had had th ’ address</l>
     <l n="101">The hunter to engage , and furnish time</l>
     <l n="102">For Rongemail to do his deed sublime .</l>
     <l n="103">Thus each his part perform 'd . Which wins the prize ?</l>
     <l n="104">The heart , so far as in my judgment lies .<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span></l>

    <head>XVII .— THE FOX , THE WOLF , AND THE HORSE .<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span></head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A fox , though young , by no means raw ,</l>
     <l n="2">Had seen a horse , the first he ever saw :</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Ho ! neighbour wolf , ’ said he to one quite green ,</l>
     <l n="4">‘ A creature in our meadow I have seen ,—</l>
     <l n="5">Sleek , grand ! I seem to see him yet ,—</l>
     <l n="6">The finest beast I ever met . ’</l>
     <l n="7">‘ Is he a stouter one than we ? ’</l>
     <l n="8">The wolf demanded , eagerly ;</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Some picture of him let me see . ’</l>
     <l n="10">‘ If I could paint , ’ said fox , ‘ I should delight</l>
     <l n="11">T ’ anticipate your pleasure at the sight ;</l>
     <l n="12">But come ; who knows ? perhaps it is a prey</l>
     <l n="13">By fortune offer 'd in our way . ’</l>
     <l n="14">They went . The horse , turn 'd loose to graze ,</l>
     <l n="15">Not liking much their looks or ways ,</l>
     <l n="16">Was just about to gallop off .</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Sir , ’ said the fox , ‘ your humble servants , we</l>
     <l n="18">Make bold to ask you what your name may be . ’</l>
     <l n="19">The horse , an animal with brains enough ,</l>
     <l n="20">Replied , ‘ Sirs , you yourselves may read my name ;</l>
     <l n="21">My shoer round my heel hath writ the same . ’</l>
     <l n="22">The fox excus 'd himself for want of knowledge :</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Me , sir , my parents did not educate ,—</l>
     <l n="24">So poor , a hole was their entire estate .</l>
     <l n="25">My friend , the wolf , however , taught at college ,</l>

     <l n="27">The wolf , to flattery weak ,</l>
     <l n="28">Approach 'd to verify the boast ;</l>
     <l n="29">For which four teeth he lost .</l>
     <l n="30">The high raised hoof came down with such a blow ,</l>
     <l n="31">As laid him bleeding on the ground full low .</l>
     <l n="32">‘ My brother , ’ said the fox , ‘ this shows how just</l>
     <l n="33">What once was taught me by a fox of wit ,—</l>
     <l n="34">Which on thy jaws this animal hath writ ,—</l>

      <l n="87">But , best , a sage ,— one such as Virgil sings ,—</l>

     <l n="50">Just then the cat came growling out ,</l>
     <l n="51">The mouse beneath his whisker 'd nose .</l>
     <l n="52">And march 'd along before his foes .</l>
     <l n="53">At such a voice , our rats discreet ,</l>
     <l n="54">Foreboding a defeat ,</l>
     <l n="55">Effected , in a style most fleet ,</l>
     <l n="56">A fortunate retreat .</l>
     <l n="57">Back hurried to his hole each rat ,</l>
