    <head>ÆNEÏS ,</head>
    <head>BOOK VIII .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The war being now begun , both the generals make all possible preparations . Turnus sends to Diomedes . Æneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans . Evander receives him kindly , furnishes him with men , and sends his son Pallas with him . Vulcan , at the request of Venus , makes arms for her son Æneas , and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity .</head>
     <l n="1">When Turnus had assembled all his powers ,</l>
     <l n="2">His standard planted on Laurentum 's towers ,</l>
     <l n="3">When now the sprightly trumpet , from afar ,</l>
     <l n="4">Had given the signal of approaching war ,</l>
     <l n="5">Had roused the neighing steeds to scour the fields ,</l>
     <l n="6">While the fierce riders clattered on their shields ,</l>
     <l n="7">Trembling with rage , the Latian youth prepare</l>
     <l n="8">To join the allies , and headlong rush to war .</l>
     <l n="9">Fierce Ufens , and Messapus , led the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="10">With bold Mezentius , who blasphemed aloud .</l>
     <l n="11">These through the country took their wasteful course ,</l>
     <l n="12">The fields to forage , and to gather force .</l>
     <l n="13">Then Venulus to Diomede they send ,</l>
     <l n="14">To beg his aid Ausonia to defend ,</l>
     <l n="15">Declare the common danger , and inform</l>
     <l n="16">The Grecian leader of the growing storm :</l>
     <l n="17">“ Æneas , landed on the Latian coast ,</l>
     <l n="18">With banished gods , and with a baffled host ,</l>
     <l n="19">Yet now aspired to conquest of the state ,</l>
     <l n="20">And claimed a title from the gods and fate ;</l>
     <l n="21">What numerous nations in his quarrel came ,</l>
     <l n="22">And how they spread his formidable name .</l>
     <l n="23">What he designed , what mischiefs might arise ,</l>
     <l n="24">If fortune favoured his first enterprize ,</l>
     <l n="25">Was left for him to weigh , whose equal fears ,</l>
     <l n="26">And common interest , was involved in theirs . ”</l>
     <l n="27">While Turnus and the allies thus urge the war , }</l>
     <l n="28">The Trojan , floating in a flood of care , }</l>
     <l n="29">Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare . }</l>
     <l n="30">This way , and that , he turns his anxious mind ;</l>
     <l n="31">Thinks and rejects the counsels he designed ;</l>
     <l n="32">Explores himself in vain , in every part ,</l>
     <l n="33">And gives no rest to his distracted heart .</l>
     <l n="34">So , when the sun by day , or moon by night ,</l>
     <l n="35">Strike on the polished brass their trembling light ,<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="36">The glittering species here and there divide ,</l>
     <l n="37">And cast their dubious beams from side to side ;</l>
     <l n="38">Now on the walls , now on the pavement play ,</l>
     <l n="39">And to the cieling flash the glaring day .</l>
     <l n="40">‘ Twas night ; and weary nature lulled asleep</l>
     <l n="41">The birds of air , and fishes of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="42">And beasts , and mortal men . The Trojan chief }</l>
     <l n="43">Was laid on Tyber 's banks , oppressed with grief , }</l>
     <l n="44">And found , in silent slumber , late relief . }</l>
     <l n="45">Then , through the shadows of the poplar wood ,</l>
     <l n="46">Arose the father of the Roman flood ;</l>
     <l n="47">An azure robe was o'er his body spread ,</l>
     <l n="48">A wreath of shady reeds adorned his head :</l>
     <l n="49">Thus , manifest to sight , the god appeared ,</l>
     <l n="50">And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheered :—</l>
     <l n="51">“ Undoubted offspring of etherial race ,</l>
     <l n="52">O long expected in this promised place !</l>
     <l n="53">Who , through the foes , hast borne thy banished gods ,</l>
     <l n="54">Restored them to their hearths , and old abodes —</l>
     <l n="55">This is thy happy home , the clime where fate</l>
     <l n="56">Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state .</l>
     <l n="57">Fear not ! The war shall end in lasting peace ,</l>
     <l n="58">And all the rage of haughty Juno cease .</l>
     <l n="59">And that this nightly vision may not seem</l>
     <l n="60">The effect of fancy , or an idle dream ,</l>
     <l n="61">A sow beneath an oak shall lie along ,</l>
     <l n="62">All white herself , and white her thirty young .</l>
     <l n="63">When thirty rolling years have run their race ,</l>
     <l n="64">Thy son Ascanius , on this empty space ,</l>
     <l n="65">Shall build a royal town , of lasting fame ,</l>
     <l n="66">Which from this omen shall receive the name .</l>
     <l n="67">Time shall approve the truth .— For what remains ,</l>
     <l n="68">And how with sure success to crown thy pains ,</l>
     <l n="69">With patience next attend . A banished band ,</l>
     <l n="70">Driven with Evander from the Arcadian land ,</l>
     <l n="71">Have planted here , and placed on high their walls ;</l>
     <l n="72">Their town the founder Pallanteum calls ,</l>
     <l n="73">Derived from Pallas , his great grandsire 's name :</l>
     <l n="74">But the fierce Latians old possession claim ,</l>
     <l n="75">With war infesting the new colony .</l>
     <l n="76">These make thy friends , and on their aid rely .</l>
     <l n="77">To thy free passage I submit my streams .</l>
     <l n="78">Wake , son of Venus , from thy pleasing dreams ;</l>
     <l n="79">And , when the setting stars are lost in day ,</l>
     <l n="80">To Juno 's power thy just devotion pay ;</l>
     <l n="81">With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease :</l>
     <l n="82">Her pride at length shall fall , her fury cease .</l>
     <l n="83">When thou return'st victorious from the war ,</l>
     <l n="84">Perform thy vows to me with grateful care .</l>
     <l n="85">The god am I , whose yellow water flows</l>
     <l n="86">Around these fields , and fattens as it goes :</l>
     <l n="87">Tyber my name — among the rolling floods ,</l>
     <l n="88">Renowned on earth , esteemed among the gods .</l>
     <l n="89">This is my certain seat . In times to come ,</l>
     <l n="90">My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome . ”</l>
     <l n="91">He said ; and plunged below . While yet he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="92">His dream Æneas and his sleep forsook .</l>
     <l n="93">He rose , and , looking up , beheld the skies</l>
     <l n="94">With purple blushing , and the day arise .</l>
     <l n="95">Then water in his hollow palm he took</l>
     <l n="96">From Tyber 's flood , and thus the powers bespoke :—</l>
     <l n="97">“ Laurentian nymphs , by whom the streams are fed ,</l>
     <l n="98">And father Tyber , in thy sacred bed</l>
     <l n="99">Receive Æneas , and from danger keep .</l>
     <l n="100">Whatever fount , whatever holy deep ,</l>
     <l n="101">Conceals thy watery stores — where'er they rise ,</l>
     <l n="102">And , bubbling from below , salute the skies —</l>
     <l n="103">Thou , king of horned floods , whose plenteous urn</l>
     <l n="104">Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn ,</l>
     <l n="105">For this thy kind compassion of our woes ,</l>
     <l n="106">Shalt share my morning song , and evening vows .</l>
     <l n="107">But , oh ! be present to thy people 's aid ,</l>
     <l n="108">And firm the gracious promise thou hast made . ”</l>
     <l n="109">Thus having said , two galleys , from his stores ,</l>
     <l n="110">With care he chuses , mans , and fits with oars .</l>
     <l n="111">Now on the shore the fatal swine is found —</l>
     <l n="112">Wonderous to tell !— She lay along the ground :</l>
     <l n="113">Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung ;</l>
     <l n="114">She white herself , and white her thirty young .</l>
     <l n="115">Æneas takes the mother and her brood ,</l>
     <l n="116">And all on Juno 's altar are bestowed .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
     <l n="117">The following night , and the succeeding day ,</l>
     <l n="118">Propitious Tyber smoothed his watery way :</l>
     <l n="119">He rolled his river back , and poised he stood ,</l>
     <l n="120">A gentle swelling , and a peaceful flood .</l>
     <l n="121">The Trojans mount their ships ; they put from shore ,</l>
     <l n="122">Borne on the waves , and scarcely dip an oar .</l>
     <l n="123">Shouts from the land give omen to their course ,</l>
     <l n="124">And the pitched vessels glide with easy force .</l>
     <l n="125">The woods and waters wonder at the gleam</l>
     <l n="126">Of shields , and painted ships that stem the stream .</l>
     <l n="127">One summer 's night and one whole day they pass</l>
     <l n="128">Betwixt the greenwood shades , and cut the liquid glass .</l>
     <l n="129">The fiery sun had finished half his race ,</l>
     <l n="130">Looked back , and doubted in the middle space ,</l>
     <l n="131">When they from far beheld the rising towers ,</l>
     <l n="132">The tops of sheds , and shepherds ’ lowly bowers ,</l>
     <l n="133">Thin as they stood , which , then of homely clay ,</l>
     <l n="134">Now rise in marble , from the Roman sway .</l>
     <l n="135">These cots ( Evander 's kingdom , mean and poor )</l>
     <l n="136">The Trojan saw , and turned his ships to shore .</l>
     <l n="137">‘ Twas on a solemn day : the Arcadian states ,</l>
     <l n="138">The king and prince , without the city gates ,</l>
     <l n="139">Then paid their offerings in a sacred grove</l>
     <l n="140">To Hercules , the warrior son of Jove .</l>
     <l n="141">Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies ,</l>
     <l n="142">And fat of entrails on his altar fries .</l>
     <l n="143">But , when they saw the ships that stemmed the flood ,</l>
     <l n="144">And glittered through the covert of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="145">They rose with fear , and left the unfinished feast ,</l>
     <l n="146">Till dauntless Pallas re-assured the rest</l>
     <l n="147">To pay the rites . Himself without delay</l>
     <l n="148">A javelin seized , and singly took his way ,</l>
     <l n="149">Then gained a rising ground , and called from far :— }</l>
     <l n="150">“ Resolve me , strangers , whence , and what you are ; }</l>
     <l n="151">Your business here ; and bring you peace or war ? ” }</l>
     <l n="152">High on the stern Æneas took his stand ,</l>
     <l n="153">And held a branch of olive in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="154">While thus he spoke :— “ The Phrygians ’ arms you see ,</l>
     <l n="155">Expelled from Troy , provoked in Italy</l>
     <l n="156">By Latian foes , with war unjustly made —</l>
     <l n="157">At first affianced , and at last betrayed .</l>
     <l n="158">This message bear :— The Trojans and their chief</l>
     <l n="159">Bring holy peace , and beg the king 's relief . ”</l>
     <l n="160">Struck with so great a name , and all on fire ,</l>
     <l n="161">The youth replies :— “ Whatever you require ,</l>
     <l n="162">Your fame exacts . Upon our shores descend ,</l>
     <l n="163">A welcome guest , and , what you wish , a friend . ”</l>
     <l n="164">He said , and , downward hasting to the strand ,</l>
     <l n="165">Embraced the stranger prince , and joined his hand .</l>
     <l n="166">Conducted to the grove , Æneas broke</l>
     <l n="167">The silence first , and thus the king bespoke :—</l>
     <l n="168">“ Best of the Greeks ! to whom , by fate 's command ,</l>
     <l n="169">I bear these peaceful branches in my hand —</l>
     <l n="170">Undaunted I approach you , though I know</l>
     <l n="171">Your birth is Grecian , and your land my foe ;</l>
     <l n="172">From Atreus though your ancient lineage came ,</l>
     <l n="173">And both the brother kings your kindred claim ;</l>
     <l n="174">Yet , my self-conscious worth , your high renown ,</l>
     <l n="175">Your virtue , through the neighbouring nations blown ,</l>
     <l n="176">Our fathers ’ mingled blood , Apollo 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="177">Have led me hither , less by need than choice .</l>
     <l n="178">Our father Dardanus , as fame has sung ,</l>
     <l n="179">And Greeks acknowledge , from Electra sprung :</l>
     <l n="180">Electra from the loins of Atlas came —</l>
     <l n="181">Atlas , whose head sustains the starry frame .</l>
     <l n="182">Your sire is Mercury , whom long before</l>
     <l n="183">On cold Cyllene 's top fair Maia bore .</l>
     <l n="184">Maia the fair , on fame if we rely ,</l>
     <l n="185">Was Atlas daughter , who sustains the sky .</l>
     <l n="186">Thus from one common source our streams divide ;</l>
     <l n="187">Ours is the Trojan , yours the Arcadian side .</l>
     <l n="188">Raised by these hopes , I sent no news before , }</l>
     <l n="189">Nor asked your leave , nor did your faith implore ; }</l>
     <l n="190">But come , without a pledge , my own ambassador . }</l>
     <l n="191">The same Rutulians , who with arms pursue</l>
     <l n="192">The Trojan race , are equal foes to you .</l>
     <l n="193">Our host expelled , what farther force can stay</l>
     <l n="194">The victor troops from universal sway ?</l>
     <l n="195">Then will they stretch their power athwart the land ,</l>
     <l n="196">And either sea from side to side command .</l>
     <l n="197">Receive our offered faith , and give us thine ;</l>
     <l n="198">Ours is a generous and experienced line :</l>
     <l n="199">We want not hearts nor bodies for the war ;</l>
     <l n="200">In council cautious , and in fields we dare . ”</l>
     <l n="201">He said ; and , while he spoke , with piercing eyes</l>
     <l n="202">Evander viewed the man with vast surprise —</l>
     <l n="203">Pleased with his action , ravished with his face ;</l>
     <l n="204">Then answered briefly , with a royal grace :—</l>
     <l n="205">“ O valiant leader of the Trojan line ,</l>
     <l n="206">In whom the features of thy father shine !</l>
     <l n="207">How I recall Anchises ! how I see</l>
     <l n="208">His motions , mien , and all my friend , in thee !</l>
     <l n="209">Long though it be , ‘ tis fresh within my mind ,</l>
     <l n="210">When Priam to his sister 's court designed</l>
     <l n="211">A welcome visit , with a friendly stay ,</l>
     <l n="212">And through the Arcadian kingdom took his way .</l>
     <l n="213">Then , past a boy , the callow down began</l>
     <l n="214">To shade my chin , and call me first a man .</l>
     <l n="215">I saw the shining train with vast delight ,</l>
     <l n="216">And Priam 's goodly person pleased my sight :</l>
     <l n="217">But great Anchises , far above the rest ,</l>
     <l n="218">With awful wonder fired my youthful breast .</l>
     <l n="219">I longed to join , in friendship 's holy bands ,</l>
     <l n="220">Our mutual hearts , and plight our mutual hands .</l>
     <l n="221">I first accosted him : I sued , I sought ,</l>
     <l n="222">And , with a loving force , to Pheneus brought .</l>
     <l n="223">He gave me , when at length constrained to go ,</l>
     <l n="224">A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow ,</l>
     <l n="225">A vest embroidered , glorious to behold , }</l>
     <l n="226">And two rich bridles , with their bits of gold , }</l>
     <l n="227">Which my son 's coursers in obedience hold . }</l>
     <l n="228">The league you ask , I offer , as your right ;</l>
     <l n="229">And , when to-morrow 's sun reveals the light ,</l>
     <l n="230">With swift supplies you shall be sent away . }</l>
     <l n="231">Now celebrate , with us , this solemn day , }</l>
     <l n="232">Whose holy rites admit no long delay . }</l>
     <l n="233">Honour our annual feast ; and take your seat ,</l>
     <l n="234">With friendly welcome , at a homely treat . ”</l>
     <l n="235">Thus having said , the bowls ( removed for fear )</l>
     <l n="236">The youths replaced , and soon restored the cheer .</l>
     <l n="237">On sods of turf he set the soldiers round :</l>
     <l n="238">A maple throne , raised higher from the ground ,</l>
     <l n="239">Received the Trojan chief ; and , o'er the bed ,</l>
     <l n="240">A lion 's shaggy hide , for ornament , they spread .</l>
     <l n="241">The loaves were served in canisters ; the wine }</l>
     <l n="242">In bowls ; the priest renewed the rites divine : }</l>
     <l n="243">Broiled entrails are their food , and beef 's continued chine . }</l>
     <l n="244">But , when the rage of hunger was repressed ,</l>
     <l n="245">Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest :—</l>
     <l n="246">“ These rites , these altars , and this feast , O king ,</l>
     <l n="247">From no vain fears or superstition spring ,</l>
     <l n="248">Or blind devotion , or from blinder chance ,</l>
     <l n="249">Or heady zeal , or brutal ignorance :</l>
     <l n="250">But , saved from danger , with a grateful sense ,</l>
     <l n="251">The labours of a god we recompense .</l>
     <l n="252">See , from afar , yon rock that mates the sky ,</l>
     <l n="253">About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie ;</l>
     <l n="254">Such indigested ruin ; bleak and bare ,</l>
     <l n="255">How desert now it stands , exposed in air !</l>
     <l n="256">‘ Twas once a robber 's den , inclosed around</l>
     <l n="257">With living stone , and deep beneath the ground ,</l>
     <l n="258">The monster Cacus , more than half a beast ,</l>
     <l n="259">This hold , impervious to the sun , possessed .</l>
     <l n="260">The pavement ever foul with human gore ;</l>
     <l n="261">Heads , and their mangled members , hung the door .</l>
     <l n="262">Vulcan this plague begot ; and , like his sire ,</l>
     <l n="263">Black clouds he belched , and flakes of livid fire .</l>
     <l n="264">Time , long expected , eased us of our load ,</l>
     <l n="265">And brought the needful presence of a god .</l>
     <l n="266">The avenging force of Hercules , from Spain , }</l>
     <l n="267">Arrived in triumph , from Geryon slain :— }</l>
     <l n="268">Thrice lived the giant , and thrice lived in vain . }</l>
     <l n="269">His prize , the lowing herds , Alcides drove</l>
     <l n="270">Near Tyber 's banks , to graze the shady grove .</l>
     <l n="271">Allured with hope of plunder , and intent</l>
     <l n="272">By force to rob , by fraud to circumvent ,</l>
     <l n="273">The brutal Cacus , as by chance they strayed ,</l>
     <l n="274">Four oxen thence , and four fair kine , conveyed .</l>
     <l n="275">And , lest the printed footsteps might be seen ,</l>
     <l n="276">He dragged them backwards to his rocky den .</l>
     <l n="277">The tracks averse a lying notice gave ,</l>
     <l n="278">And led the searcher backward from the cave .</l>
     <l n="279">Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place ,</l>
     <l n="280">To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass .</l>
     <l n="281">The beasts , who missed their mates , filled all around</l>
     <l n="282">With bellowings , and the rocks restored the sound .</l>
     <l n="283">One heifer , who had heard her love complain ,</l>
     <l n="284">Roared from the cave , and made the project vain .</l>
     <l n="285">Alcides found the fraud ; with rage he shook ,</l>
     <l n="286">And tossed about his head his knotted oak .</l>
     <l n="287">Swift as the winds , or Scythian arrows ’ flight ,</l>
     <l n="288">He clomb , with eager haste , the aërial height .</l>
     <l n="289">Then first we saw the monster mend his pace ;</l>
     <l n="290">Fear in his eyes , and paleness in his face ,</l>
     <l n="291">Confessed the god 's approach . Trembling he springs ,</l>
     <l n="292">As terror had increased his feet with wings ;</l>
     <l n="293">Nor stayed for stairs ; but down the depth he threw</l>
     <l n="294">His body , on his back the door he drew :</l>
     <l n="295">( The door , a rib of living rock ; with pains</l>
     <l n="296">His father hewed it out , and bound with iron chains ,)</l>
     <l n="297">He broke the heavy links , the mountain closed ,</l>
     <l n="298">And bars and levers to his foe opposed .</l>
     <l n="299">The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast ;</l>
     <l n="300">The fierce avenger came with bounding haste ;</l>
     <l n="301">Surveyed the mouth of the forbidden hold ,</l>
     <l n="302">And here and there his raging eyes he rolled .</l>
     <l n="303">He gnashed his teeth ; and thrice he compassed round</l>
     <l n="304">With winged speed the circuit of the ground .</l>
     <l n="305">Thrice at the cavern 's mouth he pulled in vain ,</l>
     <l n="306">And , panting , thrice desisted from his pain .</l>
     <l n="307">A pointed flinty rock , all bare and black ,</l>
     <l n="308">Grew gibbous from behind the mountain 's back ;</l>
     <l n="309">Owls , ravens , all ill omens of the night ,</l>
     <l n="310">Here built their nests , and hither winged their flight .</l>
     <l n="311">The leaning head hung threatening o'er the flood ,</l>
     <l n="312">And nodded to the left . The hero stood</l>
     <l n="313">Averse , with planted feet , and , from the right ,</l>
     <l n="314">Tugged at the solid stone with all his might .</l>
     <l n="315">Thus heaved , the fixed foundations of the rock</l>
     <l n="316">Gave way ; heaven echoed at the rattling shock .</l>
     <l n="317">Tumbling , it choked the flood : on either side</l>
     <l n="318">The banks leap backward , and the streams divide ;</l>
     <l n="319">The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread ,</l>
     <l n="320">And trembling Tyber dived beneath his bed .</l>
     <l n="321">The court of Cacus stands revealed to sight ;</l>
     <l n="322">The cavern glares with new-admitted light .</l>
     <l n="323">So the pent vapours , with a rumbling sound ,</l>
     <l n="324">Heave from below , and rend the hollow ground ;</l>
     <l n="325">A sounding flaw succeeds ; and , from on high ,</l>
     <l n="326">The gods with hate behold<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>the nether sky :</l>
     <l n="327">The ghosts repine at violated night ,</l>
     <l n="328">And curse the invading sun , and sicken at the sight .</l>
     <l n="329">The graceless monster , caught in open day ,</l>
     <l n="330">Inclosed , and in despair to fly away ,</l>
     <l n="331">Howls horrible from underneath , and fills</l>
     <l n="332">His hollow palace with unmanly yells .</l>
     <l n="333">The hero stands above , and from afar</l>
     <l n="334">Plies him with darts , and stones , and distant war .</l>
     <l n="335">He , from his nostrils and huge mouth , expires</l>
     <l n="336">Black clouds of smoke , amidst his father 's fires ,</l>
     <l n="337">Gathering , with each repeated blast , the night ,</l>
     <l n="338">To make uncertain aim , and erring sight .</l>
     <l n="339">The wrathful god then plunges from above ,</l>
     <l n="340">And , where in thickest waves the sparkles drove ,</l>
     <l n="341">There lights ; and wades through fumes , and gropes his way ,</l>
     <l n="342">Half singed , half stifled , till he grasps his prey .</l>
     <l n="343">The monster , spewing fruitless flames , he found ; }</l>
     <l n="344">He squeezed his throat ; he writhed his neck around , }</l>
     <l n="345">And in a knot his crippled members bound ; }</l>
     <l n="346">Then , from their sockets , tore his burning eyes .</l>
     <l n="347">Rolled on a heap , the breathless robber lies .</l>
     <l n="348">The doors , unbarred , receive the rushing day ,</l>
     <l n="349">And thorough lights disclose the ravished prey .</l>
     <l n="350">The bulls , redeemed , breathe open air agen .</l>
     <l n="351">Next , by the feet , they drag him from his den .</l>
     <l n="352">The wondering neighbourhood , with glad surprise , }</l>
     <l n="353">Beheld his shagged breast , his giant size , }</l>
     <l n="354">His mouth that flames no more , and his extinguished eyes . }</l>
     <l n="355">From that auspicious day , with rites divine ,</l>
     <l n="356">We worship at the hero 's holy shrine .</l>
     <l n="357">Potitius first ordained these annual vows :</l>
     <l n="358">As priests , were added the Pinarian house ,</l>
     <l n="359">Who raised this altar in the sacred shade ,</l>
     <l n="360">Where honours , ever due , for ever shall be paid .</l>
     <l n="361">For these deserts , and this high virtue shown ,</l>
     <l n="362">Ye warlike youths , your heads with garlands crown :</l>
     <l n="363">Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood ,</l>
     <l n="364">And with deep draughts invoke our common god . ”</l>
     <l n="365">This said , a double wreath Evander twined ,</l>
     <l n="366">And poplars black and white his temples bind .</l>
     <l n="367">Then brims his ample bowl . With like design</l>
     <l n="368">The rest invoke the gods , with sprinkled wine .</l>
     <l n="369">Meantime the sun descended from the skies ,</l>
     <l n="370">And the bright evening-star began to rise .</l>
     <l n="371">And now the priests , Potitius at their head ,</l>
     <l n="372">In skins of beasts involved , the long procession led ;</l>
     <l n="373">Held high the flaming tapers in their hands ,</l>
     <l n="374">As custom had prescribed their holy bands ;</l>
     <l n="375">Then with a second course the tables load ,</l>
     <l n="376">And with full chargers offer to the god .</l>
     <l n="377">The Salii sing , and cense his altars round</l>
     <l n="378">With Saban smoke , their heads with poplar bound —</l>
     <l n="379">One choir of old , another of the young ,</l>
     <l n="380">To dance , and bear the burden of the song .</l>
     <l n="381">The lay records the labours , and the praise ,</l>
     <l n="382">And all the immortal acts of Hercules :</l>
     <l n="383">First , how the mighty babe , when swathed in bands ,</l>
     <l n="384">The serpents strangled with his infant hands ;</l>
     <l n="385">Then , as in years and matchless force he grew ,</l>
     <l n="386">The Œchalian walls , and Trojan , overthrew .</l>
     <l n="387">Besides , a thousand hazards they relate ,</l>
     <l n="388">Procured by Juno 's and Eurystheus ’ hate .</l>
     <l n="389">“ Thy hands , unconquered hero , could subdue</l>
     <l n="390">The cloud-born Centaurs , and the monster crew :</l>
     <l n="391">Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood ,</l>
     <l n="392">Nor he , the roaring terror of the wood .</l>
     <l n="393">The triple porter of the Stygian seat , }</l>
     <l n="394">With lolling tongue , lay fawning at thy feet , }</l>
     <l n="395">And , seized with fear , forgot his mangled meat . }</l>
     <l n="396">The infernal waters trembled at thy sight ;</l>
     <l n="397">Thee , god ! no face of danger could affright ;</l>
     <l n="398">Not huge Typhöeus , nor the unnumbered snake ,</l>
     <l n="399">Increased with hissing heads , in Lerna 's lake .</l>
     <l n="400">Hail , Jove 's undoubted son ! an added grace</l>
     <l n="401">To heaven and the great author of thy race !</l>
     <l n="402">Receive the grateful offerings which we pay ,</l>
     <l n="403">And smile propitious on thy solemn day ! ”</l>
     <l n="404">In numbers thus they sung : above the rest ,</l>
     <l n="405">The den and death of Cacus crown the feast .</l>
     <l n="406">The woods to hollow vales convey the sound ,</l>
     <l n="407">The vales to hills , and hills the notes rebound .</l>
     <l n="408">The rites performed , the cheerful train retire .</l>
     <l n="409">Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire ,</l>
     <l n="410">The Trojan passed , the city to survey ,</l>
     <l n="411">And pleasing talk beguiled the tedious way .</l>
     <l n="412">The stranger cast around his curious eyes ,</l>
     <l n="413">New objects viewing still with new surprise ;</l>
     <l n="414">With greedy joy inquires of various things ,</l>
     <l n="415">And acts and monuments of ancient kings .</l>
     <l n="416">Then thus the founder of the Roman towers :—</l>
     <l n="417">“ These woods were first the seat of sylvan powers ,</l>
     <l n="418">Of Nymphs and Fauns , and savage men , who took</l>
     <l n="419">Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak .</l>
     <l n="420">Nor laws they knew , nor manners , nor the care }</l>
     <l n="421">Of labouring oxen , nor the shining share , }</l>
     <l n="422">Nor arts of gain , nor what they gained to spare . }</l>
     <l n="423">Their exercise the chase ; the running flood</l>
     <l n="424">Supplied their thirst , the trees supplied their food .</l>
     <l n="425">Then Saturn came , who fled the power of Jove ,</l>
     <l n="426">Robbed of his realms , and banished from above .</l>
     <l n="427">The men , dispersed on hills , to towns he brought ,</l>
     <l n="428">And laws ordained , and civil customs taught ,</l>
     <l n="429">And Latium called the land where safe he lay</l>
     <l n="430">From his unduteous son , and his usurping sway .</l>
     <l n="431">With his mild empire , peace and plenty came ;</l>
     <l n="432">And hence the golden times derived their name .</l>
     <l n="433">A more degenerate and discoloured age</l>
     <l n="434">Succeeded this , with avarice and rage .</l>
     <l n="435">The Ausonians then , and bold Sicanians , came ;</l>
     <l n="436">And Saturn 's empire often changed the name .</l>
     <l n="437">Then kings — gigantic Tybris , and the rest —</l>
     <l n="438">With arbitrary sway the land oppressed :</l>
     <l n="439">For Tyber 's flood was Albula before ,</l>
     <l n="440">Till , from the tyrant 's fate , his name it bore .</l>
     <l n="441">I last arrived , driven from my native home ,</l>
     <l n="442">By fortune 's power , and fate 's resistless doom .</l>
     <l n="443">Long tossed on seas , I sought this happy land ,</l>
     <l n="444">Warned by my mother nymph , and called by heaven 's command . ”</l>
     <l n="445">Thus , walking on , he spoke , and shewed the gate ,</l>
     <l n="446">Since called Carmental by the Roman state ;</l>
     <l n="447">Where stood an altar , sacred to the name</l>
     <l n="448">Of old Carmenta , the prophetic dame ,</l>
     <l n="449">Who to her son foretold the Ænean race ,</l>
     <l n="450">Sublime in fame , and Rome 's imperial place ;—</l>
     <l n="451">Then shews the forests , which , in after-times ,</l>
     <l n="452">Fierce Romulus , for perpetrated crimes ,</l>
     <l n="453">A sacred refuge made ;— with this , the shrine</l>
     <l n="454">Where Pan below the rock had rites divine ;—</l>
     <l n="455">Then tells of Argus ’ death , his murdered guest ,</l>
     <l n="456">Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest .</l>
     <l n="457">Thence , to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads —</l>
     <l n="458">Now roofed with gold , then thatched with homely reeds .</l>
     <l n="459">A reverent fear ( such superstition reigns</l>
     <l n="460">Among the rude ) even then possessed the swains .</l>
     <l n="461">Some god , they knew — what god , they could not tell —</l>
     <l n="462">Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell .</l>
     <l n="463">The Arcadians thought him Jove ; and said they saw</l>
     <l n="464">The mighty Thunderer with majestic awe ,</l>
     <l n="465">Who shook his shield , and dealt his bolts around ,</l>
     <l n="466">And scattered tempests on the teeming ground .</l>
     <l n="467">Then saw two heaps of ruins , ( once they stood</l>
     <l n="468">Two stately towns , on either side the flood ,)</l>
     <l n="469">Saturnia 's and Janiculum 's remains ;</l>
     <l n="470">And either place the founder 's name retains .</l>
     <l n="471">Discoursing thus together , they resort</l>
     <l n="472">Where poor Evander kept his country court .</l>
     <l n="473">They viewed the ground of Rome 's litigious hall ;</l>
     <l n="474">( Once oxen lowed , where now the lawyers bawl ,)</l>
     <l n="475">Then , stooping , through the narrow gate they pressed ,</l>
     <l n="476">When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest :—</l>
     <l n="477">“ Mean as it is , this palace , and this door ,</l>
     <l n="478">Received Alcides , then a conqueror .</l>
     <l n="479">Dare to be poor ; accept our homely food ,</l>
     <l n="480">Which feasted him , and emulate a god . ”</l>
     <l n="481">Then underneath a lowly roof he led }</l>
     <l n="482">The weary prince , and laid him on a bed ; }</l>
     <l n="483">The stuffing leaves with hides of bears o'erspread . }</l>
     <l n="484">Now night had shed her silver dews around ,</l>
     <l n="485">And with her sable wings embraced the ground ,</l>
     <l n="486">When love 's fair goddess , anxious for her son ,</l>
     <l n="487">( New tumults rising , and new wars begun ,)</l>
     <l n="488">Couched with her husband in his golden bed ,</l>
     <l n="489">With these alluring words invokes his aid —</l>
     <l n="490">And , that her pleasing speech his mind may move ,</l>
     <l n="491">Inspires each accent with the charms of love :—</l>
     <l n="492">“ While cruel fate conspired with Grecian powers ,</l>
     <l n="493">To level with the ground the Trojan towers ,</l>
     <l n="494">I asked not aid the unhappy to restore ,</l>
     <l n="495">Nor did the succour of thy skill implore ;</l>
     <l n="496">Nor urged the labours of my lord in vain ,</l>
     <l n="497">A sinking empire longer to sustain ,</l>
     <l n="498">Though much I owed to Priam 's house , and more</l>
     <l n="499">The danger of Æneas did deplore .</l>
     <l n="500">But now , by Jove 's command , and fate 's decree ,</l>
     <l n="501">His race is doomed to reign in Italy ;</l>
     <l n="502">With humble suit I beg thy needful art ,</l>
     <l n="503">O still propitious power , that rul'st my heart !</l>
     <l n="504">A mother kneels a suppliant for her son .</l>
     <l n="505">By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won</l>
     <l n="506">To forge impenetrable shields , and grace</l>
     <l n="507">With fated arms a less illustrious race .</l>
     <l n="508">Behold , what haughty nations are combined</l>
     <l n="509">Against the reliques of the Phrygian kind ,</l>
     <l n="510">With fire and sword my people to destroy ,</l>
     <l n="511">And conquer Venus twice , in conquering Troy . ”</l>
     <l n="512">She said ; and strait her arms , of snowy hue ,</l>
     <l n="513">About her unresolving husband threw .</l>
     <l n="514">Her soft embraces soon infuse desire ; }</l>
     <l n="515">His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire ; }</l>
     <l n="516">And all the godhead feels the wonted fire . }</l>
     <l n="517">Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies ,</l>
     <l n="518">Or forky lightnings flash along the skies .</l>
     <l n="519">The goddess , proud of her successful wiles ,</l>
     <l n="520">And conscious of her form , in secret smiles .</l>
     <l n="521">Then thus the power , obnoxious to her charms ,</l>
     <l n="522">Panting , and half dissolving in her arms :—</l>
     <l n="523">“ Why seek you reasons for a cause so just ,</l>
     <l n="524">Or your own beauties or my love distrust ?</l>
     <l n="525">Long since , had you required my helpful hand ,</l>
     <l n="526">The artificer and art you might command ,</l>
     <l n="527">To labour arms for Troy : nor Jove , nor Fate ,</l>
     <l n="528">Confined their empire to so short a date .</l>
     <l n="529">And , if you now desire new wars to wage ,</l>
     <l n="530">My skill I promise , and my pains engage .</l>
     <l n="531">Whatever melting metals can conspire ,</l>
     <l n="532">Or breathing bellows , or the forming fire ,</l>
     <l n="533">Is freely yours : your anxious fears remove ,</l>
     <l n="534">And think no task is difficult to love . ”</l>
     <l n="535">Trembling he spoke ; and , eager of her charms ,</l>
     <l n="536">He snatched the willing goddess to his arms ;</l>
     <l n="537">Till , in her lap infused , he lay possessed</l>
     <l n="538">Of full desire , and sunk to pleasing rest .</l>
     <l n="539">Now when the night her middle race had rode ,</l>
     <l n="540">And his first slumber had refreshed the god —</l>
     <l n="541">The time when early housewives leave the bed ;</l>
     <l n="542">When living embers on the hearth they spread ,</l>
     <l n="543">Supply the lamp , and call the maids to rise ;—</l>
     <l n="544">With yawning mouths , and with half-opened eyes ,</l>
     <l n="545">They ply the distaff by the winking light ,</l>
     <l n="546">And to their daily labour add the night :</l>
     <l n="547">Thus frugally they earn their children 's bread ,</l>
     <l n="548">And uncorrupted keep their nuptial bed —</l>
     <l n="549">Not less concerned , nor at a later hour ,</l>
     <l n="550">Rose from his downy couch the forging power .</l>
     <l n="551">Sacred to Vulcan 's name , an isle there lay ,</l>
     <l n="552">Betwixt Sicilia 's coasts and Lipare ,</l>
     <l n="553">Raised high on smoking rocks : and , deep below ,</l>
     <l n="554">In hollow caves the fires of Ætna glow .</l>
     <l n="555">The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal ;</l>
     <l n="556">Loud strokes , and hissings of tormented steel ,</l>
     <l n="557">Are heard around ; the boiling waters roar ,</l>
     <l n="558">And smoky flames through fuming tunnels soar .</l>
     <l n="559">Hither the father of the fire , by night ,</l>
     <l n="560">Through the brown air precipitates his flight .</l>
     <l n="561">On their eternal anvils here he found</l>
     <l n="562">The brethren beating , and the blows go round :</l>
     <l n="563">A load of pointless thunder now there lies</l>
     <l n="564">Before their hands , to ripen for the skies :</l>
     <l n="565">These darts , for angry Jove , they daily cast —</l>
     <l n="566">Consumed on mortals with prodigious waste .</l>
     <l n="567">Three rays of writhen rain , of fire three more ,</l>
     <l n="568">Of winged southern winds and cloudy store</l>
     <l n="569">As many parts , the dreadful mixture frame ;</l>
     <l n="570">And fears are added , and avenging flame .</l>
     <l n="571">Inferior ministers , for Mars , repair</l>
     <l n="572">His broken axle-trees , and blunted war ,</l>
     <l n="573">And send him forth again with furbished arms ,</l>
     <l n="574">To wake the lazy war , with trumpets ’ loud alarms .</l>
     <l n="575">The rest refresh the scaly snakes , that fold</l>
     <l n="576">The shield of Pallas , and renew their gold .</l>
     <l n="577">Full on the crest the Gorgon 's head they place ,</l>
     <l n="578">With eyes that roll in death , and with distorted face .</l>
     <l n="579">“ My sons ! ” said Vulcan , “ set your tasks aside ;</l>
     <l n="580">Your strength and master-skill must now be tried .</l>
     <l n="581">Arms for a hero forge — arms that require</l>
     <l n="582">Your force , your speed , and all your forming fire . ”</l>
     <l n="583">He said . They set their former work aside ,</l>
     <l n="584">And their new toils with eager haste divide .</l>
     <l n="585">A flood of molten silver , brass , and gold ,</l>
     <l n="586">And deadly steel , in the large furnace rolled ;</l>
     <l n="587">Of this , their artful hands a shield prepare ,</l>
     <l n="588">Alone sufficient to sustain the war .</l>
     <l n="589">Seven orbs within a spacious round they close :</l>
     <l n="590">One stirs the fire , and one the bellows blows .</l>
     <l n="591">The hissing steel is in the smithy drowned ;</l>
     <l n="592">The grot with beaten anvils groans around .</l>
     <l n="593">By turns , their arms advance in equal time ;</l>
     <l n="594">By turns , their hands descend , and hammers chime .</l>
     <l n="595">They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs ;</l>
     <l n="596">The fiery work proceeds , with rustic songs .</l>
     <l n="597">While , at the Lemnian god 's command , they urge</l>
     <l n="598">Their labours thus , and ply the Æolian forge ,</l>
     <l n="599">The cheerful morn salutes Evander 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="600">And songs of chirping birds invite to rise .</l>
     <l n="601">He leaves his lowly bed : his buskins meet</l>
     <l n="602">Above his ankles ; sandals sheath his feet :</l>
     <l n="603">He sets his trusty sword upon his side ,</l>
     <l n="604">And o'er his shoulder throws a panther 's hide .</l>
     <l n="605">Two menial dogs before their master press 'd .</l>
     <l n="606">Thus clad , and guarded thus , he seeks his kingly guest .</l>
     <l n="607">Mindful of promised aid , he mends his pace ,</l>
     <l n="608">But meets Æneas in the middle space .</l>
     <l n="609">Young Pallas did his father 's steps attend ,</l>
     <l n="610">And true Achates waited on his friend .</l>
     <l n="611">They join their hands ; a secret seat they chuse ;</l>
     <l n="612">The Arcadian first their former talk renews :</l>
     <l n="613">“ Undaunted prince ! I never can believe</l>
     <l n="614">The Trojan empire lost , while you survive .</l>
     <l n="615">Command the assistance of a faithful friend :</l>
     <l n="616">But feeble are the succours I can send .</l>
     <l n="617">Our narrow kingdom here the Tyber bounds ; }</l>
     <l n="618">That other side the Latian state surrounds , }</l>
     <l n="619">Insults our walls , and wastes our fruitful grounds . }</l>
     <l n="620">But mighty nations I prepare to join</l>
     <l n="621">Their arms with yours , and aid your just design .</l>
     <l n="622">You come , as by your better genius sent ,</l>
     <l n="623">And Fortune seems to favour your intent .</l>
     <l n="624">Not far from hence there stands a hilly town ,</l>
     <l n="625">Of ancient building , and of high renown ,</l>
     <l n="626">Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race ,</l>
     <l n="627">Who gave the name of Cære to the place ,</l>
     <l n="628">Once Agyllina called . It flourished long ,</l>
     <l n="629">In pride of wealth and warlike people strong ,</l>
     <l n="630">Till cursed Mezentius , in a fatal hour ,</l>
     <l n="631">Assumed the crown , with arbitrary power .</l>
     <l n="632">What words can paint those execrable times ,</l>
     <l n="633">The subjects ’ sufferings , and the tyrant 's crimes ?</l>
     <l n="634">That blood , those murders , O ye gods ! replace</l>
     <l n="635">On his own head , and on his impious race !</l>
     <l n="636">The living and the dead , at his command ,</l>
     <l n="637">Were coupled , face to face , and hand to hand ,</l>
     <l n="638">Till , choked with stench , in loathed embraces tied ,</l>
     <l n="639">The lingering wretches pined away and died .</l>
     <l n="640">Thus plunged in ills , and meditating more —</l>
     <l n="641">The people 's patience , tried , no longer bore</l>
     <l n="642">The raging monster ; but with arms beset</l>
     <l n="643">His house , and vengeance and destruction threat .</l>
     <l n="644">They fire his palace : while the flame ascends ,</l>
     <l n="645">They force his guards , and execute his friends .</l>
     <l n="646">He cleaves the crowd , and , favoured by the night ,</l>
     <l n="647">To Turnus ’ friendly court directs his flight .</l>
     <l n="648">By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire ,</l>
     <l n="649">With arms , their king to punishment require :</l>
     <l n="650">Their numerous troops , now mustered on the strand ,</l>
     <l n="651">My counsel shall submit to your command .</l>
     <l n="652">Their navy swarms upon the coasts ; they cry</l>
     <l n="653">To hoist their anchors , but the gods deny .</l>
     <l n="654">An ancient augur , skilled in future fate ,</l>
     <l n="655">With these foreboding words restrains their hate :—</l>
     <l n="656">“ Ye brave in arms , ye Lydian blood , the flower</l>
     <l n="657">Of Tuscan youth , and choice of all their power ,</l>
     <l n="658">Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms ,</l>
     <l n="659">To seek your tyrant 's death by lawful arms !</l>
     <l n="660">Know this : no native of our land may lead</l>
     <l n="661">This powerful people ; seek a foreign head . ”</l>
     <l n="662">Awed with these words , in camps they still abide ,</l>
     <l n="663">And wait with longing looks their promised guide .</l>
     <l n="664">Tarchon , the Tuscan chief , to me has sent</l>
     <l n="665">Their crown , and every regal ornament :</l>
     <l n="666">The people join their own with his desire ;</l>
     <l n="667">And all my conduct , as their king , require .</l>
     <l n="668">But the chill blood that creeps within my veins ,</l>
     <l n="669">And age , and listless limbs unfit for pains ,</l>
     <l n="670">And a soul conscious of its own decay ,</l>
     <l n="671">Have forced me to refuse imperial sway .</l>
     <l n="672">My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne ,</l>
     <l n="673">And should , but he 's a Sabine mother 's son ,</l>
     <l n="674">And half a native : but , in you , combine</l>
     <l n="675">A manly vigour , and a foreign line .</l>
     <l n="676">Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way ,</l>
     <l n="677">Pursue the ready path to sovereign sway .</l>
     <l n="678">The staff of my declining days , my son ,</l>
     <l n="679">Shall make your good or ill success his own ;</l>
     <l n="680">In fighting fields , from you shall learn to dare ,</l>
     <l n="681">And serve the hard apprenticeship of war ;</l>
     <l n="682">Your matchless courage and your conduct view ,</l>
     <l n="683">And early shall begin to admire and copy you .</l>
     <l n="684">Besides , two hundred horse he shall command —</l>
     <l n="685">Though few , a warlike and well-chosen band .</l>
     <l n="686">These in my name are listed ; and my son</l>
     <l n="687">As many more has added in his own . ”</l>
     <l n="688">Scarce had he said ; Achates and his guest ,</l>
     <l n="689">With downcast eyes , their silent grief expressed ;</l>
     <l n="690">Who , short of succours , and in deep despair ,</l>
     <l n="691">Shook at the dismal prospect of the war .</l>
     <l n="692">But his bright mother , from a breaking cloud ,</l>
     <l n="693">To cheer her issue , thundered thrice aloud ;</l>
     <l n="694">Thrice forky lightning flashed along the sky ,</l>
     <l n="695">And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high .</l>
     <l n="696">Then , gazing up , repeated peals they hear ;</l>
     <l n="697">And in a heaven serene , refulgent arms appear :</l>
     <l n="698">Reddening the skies , and glittering all around ,</l>
     <l n="699">The tempered metals clash , and yield a silver sound .</l>
     <l n="700">The rest stood trembling : struck with awe divine ,</l>
     <l n="701">Æneas only , conscious to the sign ,</l>
     <l n="702">Presaged the event , and joyful viewed , above ,</l>
     <l n="703">The accomplished promise of the queen of love .</l>
     <l n="704">Then , to the Arcadian king :— “ This prodigy</l>
     <l n="705">( Dismiss your fear ) belongs alone to me .</l>
     <l n="706">Heaven calls me to the war : the expected sign</l>
     <l n="707">Is given of promised aid , and arms divine .</l>
     <l n="708">My goddess mother , whose indulgent care</l>
     <l n="709">Foresaw the dangers of the growing war ,</l>
     <l n="710">This omen gave , when bright Vulcanian arms ,</l>
     <l n="711">Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms ,</l>
     <l n="712">Suspended , shone on high : she then foreshowed</l>
     <l n="713">Approaching fights , and fields to float in blood .</l>
     <l n="714">Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn ;</l>
     <l n="715">And corps , and swords , and shields , on Tyber borne ,</l>
     <l n="716">Shall choke his flood : now sound the loud alarms ;</l>
     <l n="717">And , Latian troops , prepare your perjured arms . ”</l>
     <l n="718">He said , and , rising from his homely throne ,</l>
     <l n="719">The solemn rites of Hercules begun ,</l>
     <l n="720">And on his altars waked the sleeping fires ;</l>
     <l n="721">Then cheerful to his household gods retires ;</l>
     <l n="722">There offers chosen sheep . The Arcadian king</l>
     <l n="723">And Trojan youth the same oblations bring .</l>
     <l n="724">Next , of his men and ships he makes review ;</l>
     <l n="725">Draws out the best , and ablest of the crew .</l>
     <l n="726">Down with the falling stream the refuse run ,</l>
     <l n="727">To raise with joyful news his drooping son .</l>
     <l n="728">Steeds are prepared to mount the Trojan band ,</l>
     <l n="729">Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land .</l>
     <l n="730">A sprightly courser , fairer than the rest ,</l>
     <l n="731">The king himself presents his royal guest .</l>
     <l n="732">A lion 's hide his back and limbs infold ,</l>
     <l n="733">Precious with studded work , and paws of gold .</l>
     <l n="734">Fame through the little city spreads aloud</l>
     <l n="735">The intended march : amid the fearful crowd ,</l>
     <l n="736">The matrons beat their breasts , dissolve in tears ,</l>
     <l n="737">And double their devotion in their fears .</l>
     <l n="738">The war at hand appears with more affright ,</l>
     <l n="739">And rises every moment to the sight .</l>
     <l n="740">Then old Evander , with a close embrace ,</l>
     <l n="741">Strained his departing friend ; and tears o'erflow his face .</l>
     <l n="742">“ Would heaven ( said he ) my strength and youth recal ,</l>
     <l n="743">Such as I was beneath Præneste 's wall —</l>
     <l n="744">Then when I made the foremost foes retire ,</l>
     <l n="745">And set whole heaps of conquered shields on fire ;</l>
     <l n="746">When Herilus in single fight I slew ,</l>
     <l n="747">Whom with three lives Feronia did endue ;</l>
     <l n="748">And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore ,</l>
     <l n="749">Till the last ebbing soul returned no more —</l>
     <l n="750">Such if I stood renewed , not these alarms ,</l>
     <l n="751">Nor death , should rend me from my Pallas ’ arms ;</l>
     <l n="752">Nor proud Mezentius thus , unpunished , boast</l>
     <l n="753">His rapes and murders on the Tuscan coast .</l>
     <l n="754">Ye gods ! and mighty Jove ! in pity bring</l>
     <l n="755">Relief , and hear a father and a king !</l>
     <l n="756">If fate and you reserve these eyes , to see</l>
     <l n="757">My son returned with peace and victory ;</l>
     <l n="758">If the loved boy shall bless his father 's sight ;</l>
     <l n="759">If we shall meet again with more delight ;</l>
     <l n="760">Then draw my life in length ; let me sustain ,</l>
     <l n="761">In hopes of his embrace , the worst of pain .</l>
     <l n="762">But , if your hard decrees — which , O ! I dread —</l>
     <l n="763">Have doomed to death his undeserving head ;</l>
     <l n="764">This , O ! this very moment let me die ,</l>
     <l n="765">While hopes and fears in equal balance lie ;</l>
     <l n="766">While , yet possessed of all his youthful charms ,</l>
     <l n="767">I strain him close within these aged arms —</l>
     <l n="768">Before that fatal news my soul shall wound ! ”</l>
     <l n="769">He said , and , swooning , sunk upon the ground .</l>
     <l n="770">His servants bore him off , and softly laid</l>
     <l n="771">His languished limbs upon his homely bed .</l>
     <l n="772">The horsemen march ; the gates are opened wide ;</l>
     <l n="773">Æneas at their head , Achates by his side .</l>
     <l n="774">Next these , the Trojan leaders rode along ;</l>
     <l n="775">Last , follows in the rear the Arcadian throng .</l>
     <l n="776">Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest ;</l>
     <l n="777">Gilded his arms , embroidered was his vest .</l>
     <l n="778">So , from the seas , exerts his radiant head</l>
     <l n="779">The star , by whom the lights of heaven are led ;</l>
     <l n="780">Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews ,</l>
     <l n="781">Dispels the darkness , and the day renews .</l>
     <l n="782">The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd ,</l>
     <l n="783">And follow , with their eyes , the dusty cloud ,</l>
     <l n="784">Which winds disperse by fits , and shew from far</l>
     <l n="785">The blaze of arms , and shields , and shining war .</l>
     <l n="786">The troops , drawn up in beautiful array ,</l>
     <l n="787">O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way .</l>
     <l n="788">Repeated peals of shouts are heard around ; }</l>
     <l n="789">The neighing coursers answer to the sound , }</l>
     <l n="790">And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground . }</l>
     <l n="791">A greenwood shade , for long religion known ,</l>
     <l n="792">Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town ,</l>
     <l n="793">Incompassed round with gloomy hills above ,</l>
     <l n="794">Which add a holy horror to the grove .</l>
     <l n="795">The first inhabitants , of Grecian blood ,</l>
     <l n="796">That sacred forest to Silvanus vowed ,</l>
     <l n="797">The guardian of their flocks and fields — and pay</l>
     <l n="798">Their due devotions on his annual day .</l>
     <l n="799">Not far from hence , along the river 's side ,</l>
     <l n="800">In tents secure , the Tuscan troops abide ,</l>
     <l n="801">By Tarchon led . Now , from a rising ground ,</l>
     <l n="802">Æneas cast his wondering eyes around ,</l>
     <l n="803">And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight ,</l>
     <l n="804">Stretched on the spacious plain from left to right .</l>
     <l n="805">Thither his warlike train the Trojan led ,</l>
     <l n="806">Refreshed his men , and wearied horses fed .</l>
     <l n="807">Meantime the mother goddess , crowned with charms ,</l>
     <l n="808">Breaks through the clouds , and brings the fated arms .</l>
     <l n="809">Within a winding vale she finds her son ,</l>
     <l n="810">On the cool river 's banks , retired alone .</l>
     <l n="811">She shews her heavenly form without disguise ,</l>
     <l n="812">And gives herself to his desiring eyes .</l>
     <l n="813">“ Behold ( she said ) performed , in every part ,</l>
     <l n="814">My promise made , and Vulcan 's laboured art .</l>
     <l n="815">Now seek , secure , the Latian enemy ,</l>
     <l n="816">And haughty Turnus to the field defy . ”</l>
     <l n="817">She said : and , having first her son embraced ,</l>
     <l n="818">The radiant arms beneath an oak she placed .</l>
     <l n="819">Proud of the gift , he rolled his greedy sight</l>
     <l n="820">Around the work , and gazed with vast delight .</l>
     <l n="821">He lifts , he turns , he poises , and admires</l>
     <l n="822">The crested helm , that vomits radiant fires :</l>
     <l n="823">His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold ,</l>

     <l n="825">Both ample , flaming both , and beamy bright ;</l>
     <l n="826">So shines a cloud , when edged with adverse light .</l>
     <l n="827">He shakes the pointed spear , and longs to try</l>
     <l n="828">The plaited cuishes on his manly thigh ;</l>
     <l n="829">But most admires the shield 's mysterious mould ,</l>
     <l n="830">And Roman triumphs rising on the gold :</l>
     <l n="831">For there , embossed , the heavenly smith had wrought</l>
     <l n="832">( Not in the rolls of future fate untaught )</l>
     <l n="833">The wars in order , and the race divine</l>

     <l n="917">Or floating mountains floating mountains meet ;</l>
     <l n="918">Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet .</l>
     <l n="919">Fire-balls are thrown , and pointed javelins fly ;</l>
     <l n="920">The fields of Neptune take a purple dye .</l>
     <l n="921">The queen herself , amidst the loud alarms ,</l>

     <l n="935">This seen , Apollo , from his Actian height ,</l>
     <l n="936">Pours down his arrows ; at whose winged flight</l>

     <l n="938">And soft Sabæans quit the watery field .</l>
     <l n="939">The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails ,</l>

     <l n="945">Just opposite , sad Nilus opens wide</l>
     <l n="946">His arms and ample bosom to the tide ,</l>
     <l n="947">And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast ,</l>

     <l n="959">Before Apollo 's porch of Parian stone ;</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This similitude is literally taken from Apollonius Rhodius ; and it is hard to say whether the original or the translation excels . But , in the shield which he describes afterwards in this Æneïd , he as much transcends his master Homer , as the arms of Glaucus were richer than those of Diomedes — Χρυσεα χαλχειων .</p>
   <p>Note II .</p>
   <p>Æneas takes the mother and her brood , And all on Juno 's altar are bestowed .— P . 4 .</p>
   <p>The translation is infinitely short of Virgil , whose words are these :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Tibi enim , tibi maxima Juno ,</l>
     <l n="2">Mactat , sacra ferens , et cum grege sistit ad aram —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>for I could not turn the word enim into English with any grace , though it was of such necessity in the Roman rites , that a sacrifice could not be performed without it . It is of the same nature , ( if I may presume to name that sacred mystery ,) in our words of consecration at the altar .</p>

    <head>BOOK IX .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Turnus takes advantage of Æneas 's absence , fires some of his ships , ( which are transformed into sea-nymphs ,) and assaults his camp . The Trojans , reduced to the last extremities , send Nisus and Euryalus to recal Æneas ; which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship , generosity , and the conclusion of their adventures .</head>
     <l n="1">While these affairs in distant places passed ,</l>
     <l n="2">The various Iris Juno sends with haste ,</l>
     <l n="3">To find bold Turnus , who , with anxious thought ,</l>
     <l n="4">The secret shade of his great grandsire sought .</l>
     <l n="5">Retired alone she found the daring man ,</l>
     <l n="6">And oped her rosy lips , and thus began :—</l>
     <l n="7">“ What none of all the gods could grant thy vows —</l>
     <l n="8">That , Turnus , this auspicious day bestows .</l>
     <l n="9">Æneas , gone to seek the Arcadian prince ,</l>
     <l n="10">Has left the Trojan camp without defence ;</l>
     <l n="11">And , short of succours there , employs his pains</l>
     <l n="12">In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains .</l>
     <l n="13">Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs ;</l>
     <l n="14">Unite thy forces , and attack their lines . ”</l>
     <l n="15">This said , on equal wings she poised her weight ,</l>
     <l n="16">And formed a radiant rainbow in her flight .</l>
     <l n="17">The Daunian hero lifts his hands and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="18">And thus invokes the goddess as she flies :—</l>
     <l n="19">“ Iris , the grace of heaven ! what power divine</l>
     <l n="20">Has sent thee down , through dusky clouds to shine ?</l>
     <l n="21">See , they divide : immortal day appears ,</l>
     <l n="22">And glittering planets dancing in their spheres !</l>
     <l n="23">With joy , these happy omens I obey ,</l>
     <l n="24">And follow , to the war , the god that leads the way . ”</l>
     <l n="25">Thus having said , as by the brook he stood ,</l>
     <l n="26">He scooped the water from the crystal flood ;</l>
     <l n="27">Then with his hands the drops to heaven he throws ,</l>
     <l n="28">And loads the powers above with offered vows .</l>
     <l n="29">Now march the bold confederates through the plain ,</l>
     <l n="30">Well horsed , well clad — a rich and shining train .</l>
     <l n="31">Messapus leads the van ; and , in the rear ,</l>
     <l n="32">The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear .</l>
     <l n="33">In the main battle , with his flaming crest ,</l>
     <l n="34">The mighty Turnus towers above the rest ,</l>
     <l n="35">Silent they move , majestically slow ,</l>
     <l n="36">Like ebbing Nile , or Ganges in his flow .</l>
     <l n="37">The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far ,</l>
     <l n="38">And the dark menace of the distant war .</l>
     <l n="39">Caïcus from the rampire saw it rise ,</l>
     <l n="40">Blackening the fields , and thickening through the skies .</l>
     <l n="41">Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls :—</l>
     <l n="42">“ What rolling clouds , my friends , approach the walls ?</l>
     <l n="43">Arm ! arm ! and man the works ! prepare your spears ,</l>
     <l n="44">And pointed darts ! the Latian host appears . ”</l>
     <l n="45">Thus warned , they shut their gates ; with shouts ascend</l>
     <l n="46">The bulwarks , and , secure , their foes attend :</l>
     <l n="47">For their wise general , with foreseeing care ,</l>
     <l n="48">Had charged them not to tempt the doubtful war ,</l>
     <l n="49">Nor , though provoked , in opens fields advance ,</l>
     <l n="50">But close within their lines attend their chance .</l>
     <l n="51">Unwilling , yet they keep the strict command ,</l>
     <l n="52">And sourly wait in arms the hostile band .</l>
     <l n="53">The fiery Turnus flew before the rest : }</l>
     <l n="54">A piebald steed of Thracian strain he pressed ; }</l>
     <l n="55">His helm of massy gold ; and crimson was his crest . }</l>
     <l n="56">With twenty horse to second his designs ,</l>
     <l n="57">An unexpected foe , he faced the lines .—</l>
     <l n="58">“ Is there , ( he said ,) in arms , who bravely dare</l>
     <l n="59">His leader 's honour and his dangers share ? ”</l>
     <l n="60">Then spurring on , his brandished dart he threw ,</l>
     <l n="61">In sign of war : applauding shouts ensue .</l>
     <l n="62">Amazed to find a dastard race , that run</l>
     <l n="63">Behind the rampires , and the battle shun ,</l>
     <l n="64">He rides around the camp , with rolling eyes ,</l>
     <l n="65">And stops at every post , and every passage tries .</l>
     <l n="66">So roams the nightly wolf about the fold :</l>
     <l n="67">Wet with descending showers , and stiff with cold ,</l>
     <l n="68">He howls for hunger , and he grins for pain ,</l>
     <l n="69">( His gnashing teeth are exercised in vain ,)</l>
     <l n="70">And , impotent of anger , finds no way</l>
     <l n="71">In his distended paws to grasp the prey .</l>
     <l n="72">The mothers listen ; but the bleating lambs</l>
     <l n="73">Securely swig the dug , beneath the dams .</l>
     <l n="74">Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain ,</l>
     <l n="75">Sharp with desire , and furious with disdain ;</l>
     <l n="76">Surveys each passage with a piercing sight ,</l>
     <l n="77">To force his foes in equal field to fight .</l>
     <l n="78">Thus while he gazes round , at length he spies ,</l>
     <l n="79">Where , fenced with strong redoubts , their navy lies .</l>
     <l n="80">Close underneath the walls : the washing tide</l>
     <l n="81">Secures from all approach this weaker side .</l>
     <l n="82">He takes the wished occasion , fills his hand</l>
     <l n="83">With ready fires , and shakes a flaming brand .</l>
     <l n="84">Urged by his presence , every soul is warmed ,</l>
     <l n="85">And every hand with kindled fires is armed .</l>
     <l n="86">From the fired pines the scattering sparkles fly ;</l>
     <l n="87">Fat vapours , mixed with flames , involve the sky .</l>
     <l n="88">What power , O Muses , could avert the flame ,</l>
     <l n="89">Which threatened , in the fleet , the Trojan name ?</l>
     <l n="90">Tell : for the fact , through length of time obscure ,</l>
     <l n="91">Is hard to faith ; yet shall the fame endure .</l>
     <l n="92">‘ Tis said , that , when the chief prepared his flight ,</l>
     <l n="93">And felled his timber from mount Ida 's height ,</l>
     <l n="94">The Grandame goddess then approached her son ,</l>
     <l n="95">And with a mother 's majesty begun :—</l>
     <l n="96">“ Grant me ( she said ) the sole request I bring ,</l>
     <l n="97">Since conquered heaven has owned you for its king .</l>
     <l n="98">On Ida 's brows , for ages past , there stood ,</l>
     <l n="99">With firs and maples filled , a shady wood ;</l>
     <l n="100">And on the summit rose a sacred grove ,</l>
     <l n="101">Where I was worshipped with religious love .</l>
     <l n="102">These woods , that holy grove , my long delight ,</l>
     <l n="103">I gave the Trojan prince , to speed his flight .</l>
     <l n="104">Now , filled with fear , on their behalf I come ;</l>
     <l n="105">Let neither winds o'erset , nor waves intomb ,</l>
     <l n="106">The floating forests of the sacred pine ;</l>
     <l n="107">But let it be their safety to be mine . ”</l>
     <l n="108">Then thus replied her awful son , who rolls</l>
     <l n="109">The radiant stars , and heaven and earth controuls :—</l>
     <l n="110">“ How dare you , mother , endless date demand</l>
     <l n="111">For vessels moulded by a mortal hand ?</l>
     <l n="112">What then is fate ? Shall bold Æneas ride ,</l>
     <l n="113">Of safety certain , on the uncertain tide ?</l>
     <l n="114">Yet , what I can , I grant : when , wafted o'er ,</l>
     <l n="115">The chief is landed on the Latian shore ,</l>
     <l n="116">Whatever ships escape the raging storms ,</l>
     <l n="117">At my command shall change their fading forms</l>
     <l n="118">To nymphs divine , and plough the watery way ,</l>
     <l n="119">Like Doto and the daughters of the sea . ”</l>
     <l n="120">To seal his sacred vow , by Styx he swore ,</l>
     <l n="121">The lake of liquid pitch , the dreary shore ,</l>
     <l n="122">And Phlegethon 's innavigable flood , }</l>
     <l n="123">And the black regions of his brother god . }</l>
     <l n="124">He said ; and shook the skies with his imperial nod . }</l>
     <l n="125">And now at length the numbered hours were come ,</l>
     <l n="126">Prefixed by fate 's irrevocable doom ,</l>
     <l n="127">When the great mother of the gods was free</l>
     <l n="128">To save her ships , and finish Jove 's decree .</l>
     <l n="129">First , from the quarter of the morn , there sprung</l>
     <l n="130">A light that signed the heavens , and shot along ;</l>
     <l n="131">Then from a cloud , fringed round with golden fires ,</l>
     <l n="132">Were timbrels heard , and Berecynthian choirs ;</l>
     <l n="133">And , last , a voice , with more than mortal sounds ,</l>
     <l n="134">Both hosts , in arms opposed , with equal horror wounds :—</l>
     <l n="135">“ O Trojan race ! your needless aid forbear ,</l>
     <l n="136">And know , my ships are my peculiar care .</l>
     <l n="137">With greater ease the bold Rutulian may ,</l>
     <l n="138">With hissing brands , attempt to burn the sea ,</l>
     <l n="139">Than singe my sacred pines . But you , my charge ,</l>
     <l n="140">Loosed from your crooked anchors , launch at large ,</l>
     <l n="141">Exalted each a nymph : forsake the sand ,</l>
     <l n="142">And swim the seas , at Cybele 's command . ”</l>
     <l n="143">No sooner had the goddess ceased to speak ,</l>
     <l n="144">When , lo ! the obedient ships their halsers break ;</l>
     <l n="145">And , strange to tell , like dolphins , in the main</l>
     <l n="146">They plunge their prows , and dive , and spring again :</l>
     <l n="147">As many beauteous maids the billows sweep ,</l>
     <l n="148">As rode before tall vessels on the deep .</l>
     <l n="149">The foes , surprised with wonder , stood aghast ;</l>
     <l n="150">Messapus curbed his fiery courser 's haste :</l>
     <l n="151">Old Tyber roared , and , raising up his head ,</l>
     <l n="152">Called back his waters to their oozy bed .</l>
     <l n="153">Turnus alone , undaunted , bore the shock ,</l>
     <l n="154">And with these words his trembling troops bespoke :—</l>
     <l n="155">“ These monsters for the Trojans ’ fate are meant ,</l>
     <l n="156">And are by Jove for black presages sent .</l>
     <l n="157">He takes the cowards ’ last relief away ; }</l>
     <l n="158">For fly they cannot , and , constrained to stay , }</l>
     <l n="159">Must yield unfought , a base inglorious prey . }</l>
     <l n="160">The liquid half of all the globe is lost ;</l>
     <l n="161">Heaven shuts the seas , and we secure the coast .</l>
     <l n="162">Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground ,</l>
     <l n="163">Which myriads of our martial men surround .</l>
     <l n="164">Their feats I fear not , or vain oracles .</l>
     <l n="165">‘ Twas given to Venus they should cross the seas ,</l>
     <l n="166">And land secure upon the Latian plains :</l>
     <l n="167">Their promised hour is passed , and mine remains .</l>
     <l n="168">‘ Tis in the fate of Turnus , to destroy ,</l>
     <l n="169">With sword and fire , the faithless race of Troy .</l>
     <l n="170">Shall such affronts as these , alone , inflame</l>
     <l n="171">The Grecian brothers , and the Grecian name ?</l>
     <l n="172">My cause and theirs is one ; a fatal strife ,</l>
     <l n="173">And final ruin , for a ravished wife .</l>
     <l n="174">Was't not enough , that , punished for the crime ,</l>
     <l n="175">They fell — but will they fall a second time ?</l>
     <l n="176">One would have thought they paid enough before ,</l>
     <l n="177">To curse the costly sex , and durst offend no more .</l>
     <l n="178">Can they securely trust their feeble wall ,</l>
     <l n="179">A slight partition , a thin interval ,</l>
     <l n="180">Betwixt their fate and them ; when Troy , though built</l>
     <l n="181">By hands divine , yet perished by their guilt ?</l>
     <l n="182">Lend me , for once , my friends , your valiant hands ,</l>
     <l n="183">To force from out their lines these dastard bands .</l>
     <l n="184">Less than a thousand ships will end this war ,</l>
     <l n="185">Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare .</l>
     <l n="186">Let all the Tuscans , all the Arcadians , join !</l>
     <l n="187">Nor these , nor those , shall frustrate my design .</l>
     <l n="188">Let them not fear the treasons of the night , }</l>
     <l n="189">The robbed Palladium , the pretended flight : }</l>
     <l n="190">Our onset shall be made in open light . }</l>
     <l n="191">No wooden engine shall their town betray ;</l>
     <l n="192">Fires they shall have around , but fires by day .</l>
     <l n="193">No Grecian babes before their camp appear ,</l>
     <l n="194">Whom Hector 's arms detained to the tenth tardy year .</l>
     <l n="195">Now , since the sun is rolling to the west ,</l>
     <l n="196">Give we the silent night to needful rest :</l>
     <l n="197">Refresh your bodies , and your arms prepare ;</l>
     <l n="198">The morn shall end the small remains of war . ”</l>
     <l n="199">The post of honour to Messapus falls ,</l>
     <l n="200">To keep the nightly guard , to watch the walls ,</l>
     <l n="201">To pitch the fires at distances around ,</l>
     <l n="202">And close the Trojans in their scanty ground .</l>
     <l n="203">Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand ,</l>
     <l n="204">And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command ;</l>
     <l n="205">All clad in shining arms the works invest ,</l>
     <l n="206">Each with a radiant helm and waving crest .</l>
     <l n="207">Stretched at their length , they press the grassy ground ;</l>
     <l n="208">They laugh , they sing , ( the jolly bowls go round ,)</l>
     <l n="209">With lights and cheerful fires renew the day ,</l>
     <l n="210">And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play .</l>
     <l n="211">The Trojans , from above , their foes beheld ,</l>
     <l n="212">And with armed legions all the rampires filled .</l>
     <l n="213">Seized with affright , their gates they first explore ;</l>
     <l n="214">Join works to works with bridges , tower to tower :</l>
     <l n="215">Thus all things needful for defence abound :</l>
     <l n="216">Mnestheus and brave Serestus walk the round ,</l>
     <l n="217">Commissioned by their absent prince to share</l>
     <l n="218">The common danger , and divide the care .</l>
     <l n="219">The soldiers draw their lots , and , as they fall ,</l>
     <l n="220">By turns relieve each other on the wall .</l>
     <l n="221">Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance ,</l>
     <l n="222">To watch the gate was warlike Nisus ’ chance .</l>
     <l n="223">His father Hyrtacus of noble blood ;</l>
     <l n="224">His mother was a huntress of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="225">And sent him to the wars . Well could he bear</l>
     <l n="226">His lance in fight , and dart the flying spear ,</l>
     <l n="227">But better skilled unerring shafts to send .</l>
     <l n="228">Beside him stood Euryalus , his friend —</l>
     <l n="229">Euryalus , than whom the Trojan host</l>
     <l n="230">No fairer face , or sweeter air , could boast .</l>
     <l n="231">Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun .</l>
     <l n="232">One was their care , and their delight was one .</l>
     <l n="233">One common hazard in the war they shared ,</l>
     <l n="234">And now were both by choice upon the guard .</l>
     <l n="235">Then Nisus thus :— “ Or do the gods inspire</l>
     <l n="236">This warmth , or make we gods of our desire ?</l>
     <l n="237">A generous ardour boils within my breast ,</l>
     <l n="238">Eager of action , enemy to rest :</l>
     <l n="239">This urges me to fight , and fires my mind ,</l>
     <l n="240">To leave a memorable name behind .</l>
     <l n="241">Thou seest the foe secure ; how faintly shine</l>
     <l n="242">Their scattered fires : the most , in sleep supine</l>
     <l n="243">Along the ground , an easy conquest lie :</l>
     <l n="244">The wakeful few the fuming flaggon ply :</l>
     <l n="245">All hushed around . Now hear what I revolve —</l>
     <l n="246">A thought unripe — and scarcely yet resolve .</l>
     <l n="247">Our absent prince both camp and council mourn ;</l>
     <l n="248">By message both would hasten his return :</l>
     <l n="249">If they confer what I demand on thee ,</l>
     <l n="250">( For fame is recompense enough for me ,)</l>
     <l n="251">Methinks , beneath yon hill , I have espied</l>
     <l n="252">A way that safely will my passage guide . ”</l>
     <l n="253">Euryalus stood listening while he spoke ;</l>
     <l n="254">With love of praise , and noble envy struck ;</l>
     <l n="255">Then to his ardent friend exposed his mind :— }</l>
     <l n="256">“ All this , alone , and leaving me behind ! }</l>
     <l n="257">Am I unworthy , Nisus , to be joined ? }</l>
     <l n="258">Think'st thou I can my share of glory yield ,</l>
     <l n="259">Or send thee unassisted to the field ?</l>
     <l n="260">Not so my father taught my childhood arms —</l>
     <l n="261">Born in a siege , and bred among alarms .</l>
     <l n="262">Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend ,</l>
     <l n="263">Nor of the heaven born hero I attend .</l>
     <l n="264">The thing , called life , with ease I can disclaim ,</l>
     <l n="265">And think it over-sold to purchase fame . ”</l>
     <l n="266">Then Nisus thus :— “ Alas ! thy tender years</l>
     <l n="267">Would minister new matter to my fears .</l>
     <l n="268">So may the gods , who view this friendly strife ,</l>
     <l n="269">Restore me to thy loved embrace with life ,</l>
     <l n="270">Condemned to pay my vows , ( as sure I trust ,)</l>
     <l n="271">This thy request is cruel and unjust .</l>
     <l n="272">But if some chance — as many chances are ,</l>
     <l n="273">And doubtful hazards , in the deeds of war —</l>
     <l n="274">If one should reach my head , there let it fall ,</l>
     <l n="275">And spare thy life ; I would not perish all .</l>
     <l n="276">Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date :</l>
     <l n="277">Live thou to mourn thy love 's unhappy fate ,</l>
     <l n="278">To bear my mangled body from the foe ,</l>
     <l n="279">Or buy it back , and funeral rites bestow .</l>
     <l n="280">Or , if hard fortune shall those dues deny ,</l>
     <l n="281">Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply .</l>
     <l n="282">O ! let not me the widow 's tears renew ,</l>
     <l n="283">Nor let a mother 's curse my name pursue —</l>
     <l n="284">Thy pious parent , who , for love of thee ,</l>
     <l n="285">Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily ,</l>
     <l n="286">Her age committing to the seas and wind ,</l>
     <l n="287">When every weary matron staid behind . ”</l>
     <l n="288">To this , Euryalus :— “ You plead in vain ,</l>
     <l n="289">And but protract the cause you cannot gain .</l>
     <l n="290">No more delays ! but haste ! ” With that , he wakes</l>
     <l n="291">The nodding watch ; each to his office takes .</l>
     <l n="292">The guard relieved , the generous couple went</l>
     <l n="293">To find the council at the royal tent .</l>
     <l n="294">All creatures else forgot their daily care ,</l>
     <l n="295">And sleep , the common gift of nature , share ;</l>
     <l n="296">Except the Trojan peers , who wakeful sate</l>
     <l n="297">In nightly council for the endangered state .</l>
     <l n="298">They vote a message to their absent chief ,</l>
     <l n="299">Shew their distress , and beg a swift relief .</l>
     <l n="300">Amid the camp a silent seat they chose ,</l>
     <l n="301">Remote from clamour , and secure from foes .</l>
     <l n="302">On their left arms their ample shields they bear ,</l>
     <l n="303">Their right reclined upon the bending spear .</l>
     <l n="304">Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard , }</l>
     <l n="305">And beg admission , eager to be heard — }</l>
     <l n="306">The affair important , not to be deferred . }</l>
     <l n="307">Ascanius bids them be conducted in ,</l>
     <l n="308">Ordering the more experienced to begin .</l>
     <l n="309">Then Nisus thus :— “ Ye fathers , lend your ears ;</l>
     <l n="310">Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years .</l>
     <l n="311">The foe , securely drenched in sleep and wine ,</l>
     <l n="312">Neglect their watch ; the fires but thinly shine ;</l>
     <l n="313">And , where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies ,</l>
     <l n="314">Covering the plain , and curling to the skies ,</l>
     <l n="315">Betwixt two paths , which at the gate divide , }</l>
     <l n="316">Close by the sea , a passage we have spied , }</l>
     <l n="317">Which will our way to great Æneas guide . }</l>
     <l n="318">Expect each hour to see him safe again ,</l>
     <l n="319">Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain .</l>
     <l n="320">Snatch we the lucky minute while we may ;</l>
     <l n="321">Nor can we be mistaken in the way ;</l>
     <l n="322">For , hunting in the vales , we both have seen</l>
     <l n="323">The rising turrets , and the stream between ,</l>
     <l n="324">And know the winding course , with every ford . ”</l>
     <l n="325">He ceased ; and old Aletes took the word :—</l>
     <l n="326">“ Our country gods , in whom our trust we place ,</l>
     <l n="327">Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race ,</l>
     <l n="328">While we behold such dauntless worth appear</l>
     <l n="329">In dawning youth , and souls so void of fear . ”</l>
     <l n="330">Then into tears of joy the father broke ; }</l>
     <l n="331">Each in his longing arms by turns he took ; }</l>
     <l n="332">Panted and paused ; and thus again he spoke :— }</l>
     <l n="333">“ Ye brave young men , what equal gifts can we ,</l>
     <l n="334">In recompense of such desert , decree ?</l>
     <l n="335">The greatest , sure , and best you can receive ,</l>
     <l n="336">The gods and your own conscious worth will give .</l>
     <l n="337">The rest our grateful general will bestow ,</l>
     <l n="338">And young Ascanius , till his manhood , owe . ”</l>
     <l n="339">“ And I , whose welfare in my father lies , ”</l>
     <l n="340">Ascanius adds , “ by the great deities ,</l>
     <l n="341">By my dear country , by my household gods ,</l>
     <l n="342">By hoary Vesta 's rites and dark abodes ,</l>
     <l n="343">Adjure you both , ( on you my fortune stands ;</l>
     <l n="344">That and my faith I plight into your hands ,)</l>
     <l n="345">Make me but happy in his safe return ,</l>
     <l n="346">Whose wanted presence I can only mourn ;</l>
     <l n="347">Your common gift shall two large goblets be</l>
     <l n="348">Of silver , wrought with curious imagery ,</l>
     <l n="349">And high embossed , which , when old Priam reigned ,</l>
     <l n="350">My conquering sire at sacked Arisba gained ;</l>
     <l n="351">And , more , two tripods cast in antique mould ,</l>
     <l n="352">With two great talents of the finest gold ;</l>
     <l n="353">Beside a costly bowl , engraved with art ,</l>
     <l n="354">Which Dido gave , when first she gave her heart .</l>
     <l n="355">But , if in conquered Italy we reign ,</l>
     <l n="356">When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain —</l>
     <l n="357">Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus pressed ,</l>
     <l n="358">That , Nisus ! and his arms , and nodding crest ,</l>
     <l n="359">And shield , from chance exempt , shall be thy share ; }</l>
     <l n="360">Twelve labouring slaves , twelve handmaids young and fair , }</l>
     <l n="361">All clad in rich attire , and trained with care ; }</l>
     <l n="362">And , last , a Latian field with fruitful plains ,</l>
     <l n="363">And a large portion of the king 's domains .</l>
     <l n="364">But thou , whose years are more to mine allied ,</l>
     <l n="365">No fate my vowed affection shall divide</l>
     <l n="366">From thee , heroic youth ! Be wholly mine ;</l>
     <l n="367">Take full possession ; all my soul is thine .</l>
     <l n="368">One faith , one fame , one fate , shall both attend :</l>
     <l n="369">My life 's companion , and my bosom friend —</l>
     <l n="370">My peace shall be committed to thy care ;</l>
     <l n="371">And , to thy conduct , my concerns in war . ”</l>
     <l n="372">Then thus the young Euryalus replied :—</l>
     <l n="373">“ Whatever fortune , good or bad , betide ,</l>
     <l n="374">The same shall be my age , as now my youth ;</l>
     <l n="375">No time shall find me wanting to my truth .</l>
     <l n="376">This only from your goodness let me gain —</l>
     <l n="377">( And , this ungranted , all rewards are vain ,)</l>
     <l n="378">Of Priam 's royal race my mother came —</l>
     <l n="379">And sure the best that ever bore the name —</l>
     <l n="380">Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold</l>
     <l n="381">From me departing , but , o'erspent and old ,</l>
     <l n="382">My fate she followed . Ignorant of this</l>
     <l n="383">( Whatever ) danger , neither parting kiss ,</l>
     <l n="384">Nor pious blessing taken , her I leave ,</l>
     <l n="385">And in this only act of all my life deceive .</l>
     <l n="386">By this right hand , and conscious night , I swear ,</l>
     <l n="387">My soul so sad a farewell could not bear .</l>
     <l n="388">Be you her comfort ; fill my vacant place ;</l>
     <l n="389">( Permit me to presume so great a grace ;)</l>
     <l n="390">Support her age , forsaken and distressed .</l>
     <l n="391">That hope alone will fortify my breast</l>
     <l n="392">Against the worst of fortunes , and of fears . ”</l>
     <l n="393">He said . The moved assistants melt in tears .</l>
     <l n="394">Then thus Ascanius , wonder-struck to see</l>
     <l n="395">That image of his filial piety :—</l>
     <l n="396">“ So great beginnings , in so green an age ,</l>
     <l n="397">Exact the faith which I again engage .</l>
     <l n="398">Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim ,</l>
     <l n="399">Creüsa had , and only want the name .</l>
     <l n="400">Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have ,</l>
     <l n="401">‘ Tis merit to have borne a son so brave .</l>
     <l n="402">Now by my head , a sacred oath , I swear ,</l>
     <l n="403">( My father used it ,) what , returning here</l>
     <l n="404">Crowned with success , I for thyself prepare ,</l>
     <l n="405">That , if thou fail , shall thy loved mother share . ”</l>
     <l n="406">He said , and , weeping while he spoke the word ,</l>
     <l n="407">From his broad belt he drew a shining sword ,</l>
     <l n="408">Magnificent with gold . Lycaon made ,</l>
     <l n="409">And in an ivory scabbard sheathed the blade .</l>
     <l n="410">This was his gift . Great Mnestheus gave his friend</l>
     <l n="411">A lion 's hide , his body to defend ;</l>
     <l n="412">And good Aletes furnished him , beside ,</l>
     <l n="413">With his own trusty helm , of temper tried .</l>
     <l n="414">Thus armed they went . The noble Trojans wait</l>
     <l n="415">Their issuing forth , and follow to the gate</l>
     <l n="416">With prayers and vows . Above the rest appears</l>
     <l n="417">Ascanius , manly far beyond his years ,</l>
     <l n="418">And messages committed to their care ,</l>
     <l n="419">Which all in winds were lost , and flitting air .</l>
     <l n="420">The trenches first they passed ; then took their way</l>
     <l n="421">Where their proud foes in pitched pavilions lay ;</l>
     <l n="422">To many fatal , ere themselves were slain .</l>
     <l n="423">They found the careless host dispersed upon the plain ,</l>
     <l n="424">Who , gorged , and drunk with wine , supinely snore .</l>
     <l n="425">Unharnessed chariots stand along the shore :</l>
     <l n="426">Amidst the wheels and reins , the goblet by ,</l>
     <l n="427">A medley of debauch and war , they lie .</l>
     <l n="428">Observing Nisus shewed his friend the sight :—</l>
     <l n="429">“ Behold a conquest gained without a fight .</l>
     <l n="430">Occasion offers , and I stand prepared ;</l>
     <l n="431">There lies our way : be thou upon the guard ,</l>
     <l n="432">And look around , while I securely go ,</l>
     <l n="433">And hew a passage through the sleeping foe . ”</l>
     <l n="434">Softly he spoke ; then , striding , took his way ,</l>
     <l n="435">With his drawn sword , where haughty Rhamnes lay ;</l>
     <l n="436">His head raised high on tapestry beneath ,</l>
     <l n="437">And heaving from his breast , he drew his breath —</l>
     <l n="438">A king and prophet , by king Turnus loved ;</l>
     <l n="439">But fate by prescience cannot be removed .</l>
     <l n="440">Him and his sleeping slaves he slew ; then spies</l>
     <l n="441">Where Remus , with his rich retinue , lies .</l>
     <l n="442">His armour-bearer first , and next he kills</l>
     <l n="443">His charioteer , intrenched betwixt the wheels</l>
     <l n="444">And his loved horses ; last invades their lord ;</l>
     <l n="445">Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword :</l>
     <l n="446">The gasping head flies off ; a purple flood</l>
     <l n="447">Flows from the trunk , that welters in the blood ,</l>
     <l n="448">Which , by the spurning heels dispersed around ,</l>
     <l n="449">The bed besprinkles , and bedews the ground .</l>
     <l n="450">Lamus the bold , and Lamyrus the strong ,</l>
     <l n="451">He slew , and then Sarranus fair and young .</l>
     <l n="452">From dice and wine the youth retired to rest ,</l>
     <l n="453">And puffed the fumy god from out his breast :</l>
     <l n="454">Even then he dreamt of drink and lucky play —</l>
     <l n="455">More lucky , had it lasted till the day .</l>
     <l n="456">The famished lion thus , with hunger bold ,</l>
     <l n="457">O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold ,</l>
     <l n="458">And tears the peaceful flocks : with silent awe</l>
     <l n="459">Trembling they lie , and pant beneath his paw .</l>
     <l n="460">Nor with less rage Euryalus employs</l>
     <l n="461">The wrathful sword , or fewer foes destroys :</l>
     <l n="462">But on the ignoble crowd his fury flew ;</l>
     <l n="463">He Fadus , Hebesus , and Rhoetus slew .</l>
     <l n="464">Oppressed with heavy sleep the former fall ,</l>
     <l n="465">But Rhoetus wakeful , and observing all :</l>
     <l n="466">Behind a spacious jar he slinked for fear ;</l>
     <l n="467">The fatal iron found and reached him there ;</l>
     <l n="468">For , as he rose , it pierced his naked side ,</l>
     <l n="469">And , reeking , thence returned in crimson dyed .</l>
     <l n="470">The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood ;</l>
     <l n="471">The purple soul comes floating in the flood .</l>
     <l n="472">Now , where Messapus quartered , they arrive .</l>
     <l n="473">The fires were fainting there , and just alive :</l>
     <l n="474">The warrior-horses , tied in order , fed ;</l>
     <l n="475">Nisus observed the discipline , and said :—</l>
     <l n="476">“ Our eager thirst of blood may both betray ;</l>
     <l n="477">And see the scattered streaks of dawning day ,</l>
     <l n="478">Foe to nocturnal thefts . No more , my friend ;</l>
     <l n="479">Here let our glutted execution end .</l>
     <l n="480">A lane through slaughtered bodies we have made . ”</l>
     <l n="481">The bold Euryalus , though loth , obeyed .</l>
     <l n="482">Of arms , and arras , and of plate , they find</l>
     <l n="483">A precious load ; but these they leave behind .</l>
     <l n="484">Yet , fond of gaudy spoils , the boy would stay }</l>
     <l n="485">To make the rich caparison his prey , }</l>
     <l n="486">Which on the steed of conquered Rhamnes lay . }</l>
     <l n="487">Nor did his eyes less longingly behold</l>
     <l n="488">The girdle-belt , with nails of burnished gold .</l>
     <l n="489">This present Cædicus the rich bestowed</l>
     <l n="490">On Remulus , when friendship first they vowed ,</l>
     <l n="491">And , absent , joined in hospitable ties :</l>
     <l n="492">He , dying , to his heir bequeathed the prize ;</l>
     <l n="493">Till , by the conquering Ardean troops oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="494">He fell ; and they the glorious gift possessed .</l>
     <l n="495">These glittering spoils ( now made the victor 's gain )</l>
     <l n="496">He to his body suits , but suits in vain .</l>
     <l n="497">Messapus ’ helm he finds among the rest ,</l>
     <l n="498">And laces on , and wears the waving crest .</l>
     <l n="499">Proud of their conquest , prouder of their prey ,</l>
     <l n="500">They leave the camp , and take the ready way .</l>
     <l n="501">But far they had not passed , before they spied</l>
     <l n="502">Three hundred horse , with Volscens for their guide .</l>
     <l n="503">The queen a legion to king Turnus sent ; }</l>
     <l n="504">But the swift horse the slower foot prevent , }</l>
     <l n="505">And now , advancing , sought the leader 's tent . }</l>
     <l n="506">They saw the pair ; for , through the doubtful shade , }</l>
     <l n="507">His shining helm Euryalus betrayed , }</l>
     <l n="508">On which the moon with full reflexion played . }</l>
     <l n="509">“ ‘ Tis not for nought , ” cried Volscens from the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="510">“ These men go there ; ” then raised his voice aloud :</l>
     <l n="511">“ Stand ! stand ! why thus in arms ? and whither bent ?</l>
     <l n="512">From whence , to whom , and on what errand sent ? ”</l>
     <l n="513">Silent they scud away , and haste their flight</l>
     <l n="514">To neighbouring woods , and trust themselves to night .</l>
     <l n="515">The speedy horse all passages belay ,</l>
     <l n="516">And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way ;</l>
     <l n="517">And watch each entrance of the winding wood .</l>
     <l n="518">Black was the forest : thick with beech it stood ,</l>
     <l n="519">Horrid with fern , and intricate with thorn ;</l>
     <l n="520">Few paths of human feet , or tracks of beasts , were worn .</l>
     <l n="521">The darkness of the shades , his heavy prey ,</l>
     <l n="522">And fear , misled the younger from his way .</l>
     <l n="523">But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste ,</l>
     <l n="524">And , thoughtless of his friend , the forest passed ,</l>
     <l n="525">And Alban plains ( from Alba 's name so called )</l>
     <l n="526">Where king Latinus then his oxen stalled ;</l>
     <l n="527">Till , turning at the length , he stood his ground ,</l>
     <l n="528">And missed his friend , and cast his eyes around :—</l>
     <l n="529">“ Ah wretch ! ” he cried — “ where have I left behind</l>
     <l n="530">The unhappy youth ? where shall I hope to find ?</l>
     <l n="531">Or what way take ? ” Again he ventures back ,</l>
     <l n="532">And treads the mazes of his former track .</l>
     <l n="533">He winds the wood , and , listening , hears the noise</l>
     <l n="534">Of trampling coursers , and the riders ’ voice .</l>
     <l n="535">The sound approached ; and suddenly he viewed</l>
     <l n="536">The foes inclosing , and his friend pursued ,</l>
     <l n="537">Forelaid and taken , while he strove in vain</l>
     <l n="538">The shelter of the friendly shades to gain .</l>
     <l n="539">What should he next attempt ? what arms employ ,</l>
     <l n="540">What fruitless force , to free the captive boy ?</l>
     <l n="541">Or desperate should he rush and lose his life ,</l>
     <l n="542">With odds oppressed , in such unequal strife ?</l>
     <l n="543">Resolved at length , his pointed spear he shook ;</l>
     <l n="544">And , casting on the moon a mournful look ,—</l>
     <l n="545">“ Guardian of groves , and goddess of the night !</l>
     <l n="546">Fair queen ! ” he said , “ direct my dart aright .</l>
     <l n="547">If e'er my pious father , for my sake ,</l>
     <l n="548">Did grateful offerings on thy altars make ,</l>
     <l n="549">Or I increased them with my sylvan toils ,</l>
     <l n="550">And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils ,</l>
     <l n="551">Give me to scatter these . ” Then from his ear</l>
     <l n="552">He poised , and aimed , and launched the trembling spear .</l>
     <l n="553">The deadly weapon , hissing from the grove ,</l>
     <l n="554">Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove ;</l>
     <l n="555">Pierced his thin armour , drank his vital blood ,</l>
     <l n="556">And in his body left the broken wood .</l>
     <l n="557">He staggers round ; his eyeballs roll in death ,</l>
     <l n="558">And with short sobs he gasps away his breath .</l>
     <l n="559">All stand amazed :— a second javelin flies</l>
     <l n="560">With equal strength , and quivers through the skies .</l>
     <l n="561">This through thy temples , Tagus , forced the way ,</l>
     <l n="562">And in the brain-pan warmly buried lay .</l>
     <l n="563">Fierce Volscens foams with rage , and , gazing round ,</l>
     <l n="564">Descried not him who gave the fatal wound ,</l>
     <l n="565">Nor knew to fix revenge :— “ But thou , ” he cries ,</l>
     <l n="566">“ Shalt pay for both , ” and at the prisoner flies</l>
     <l n="567">With his drawn sword . Then , struck with deep despair ,</l>
     <l n="568">That cruel sight the lover could not bear ;</l>
     <l n="569">But from his covert rushed in open view ,</l>
     <l n="570">And sent his voice before him as he flew :—</l>
     <l n="571">“ Me ! me ! ” he cried — “ turn all your swords alone</l>
     <l n="572">On me — the fact confessed , the fault my own .</l>
     <l n="573">He neither could nor durst , the guiltless youth —</l>
     <l n="574">Ye moon and stars , bear witness to the truth !</l>
     <l n="575">His only crime ( if friendship can offend )</l>
     <l n="576">Is too much love to his unhappy friend . ”</l>
     <l n="577">Too late he speaks :— the sword , which fury guides ,</l>
     <l n="578">Driven with full force , had pierced his tender sides .</l>
     <l n="579">Down fell the beauteous youth : the yawning wound</l>
     <l n="580">Gushed out a purple stream , and stained the ground .</l>
     <l n="581">His snowy neck reclines upon his breast ,</l>
     <l n="582">Like a fair flower by the keen share oppressed —</l>
     <l n="583">Like a white poppy sinking on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="584">Whose heavy head is overcharged with rain .</l>
     <l n="585">Despair , and rage , and vengeance justly vowed ,</l>
     <l n="586">Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd .</l>
     <l n="587">Volscens he seeks ; on him alone he bends :</l>
     <l n="588">Borne back and bored by his surrounding friends ,</l>
     <l n="589">Onward he pressed , and kept him still in sight ,</l>
     <l n="590">Then whirled aloft his sword with all his might :</l>
     <l n="591">The unerring steel descended while he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="592">Pierced his wide mouth , and through his weazon broke .</l>
     <l n="593">Dying , he slew ; and , staggering on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="594">With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain ;</l>
     <l n="595">Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell ,</l>
     <l n="596">Content , in death , to be revenged so well .</l>
     <l n="597">O happy friends ! for , if my verse can give</l>
     <l n="598">Immortal life , your fame shall ever live ,</l>
     <l n="599">Fixed as the Capitol 's foundation lies ,</l>
     <l n="600">And spread , where'er the Roman eagle flies !</l>
     <l n="601">The conquering party first divide the prey ,</l>
     <l n="602">Then their slain leader to the camp convey .</l>
     <l n="603">With wonder , as they went , the troops were filled ,</l>
     <l n="604">To see such numbers whom so few had killed .</l>
     <l n="605">Saranus , Rhamnes , and the rest , they found ; }</l>
     <l n="606">Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround ; }</l>
     <l n="607">And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground . }</l>
     <l n="608">All knew the helmet which Messapus lost ,</l>
     <l n="609">But mourned a purchase that so dear had cost .</l>
     <l n="610">Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="611">And with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread :</l>
     <l n="612">Nor long the sun his daily course with-held ,</l>
     <l n="613">But added colours to the world revealed :</l>
     <l n="614">When early Turnus , wakening with the light ,</l>
     <l n="615">All clad in armour , calls his troops to fight .</l>
     <l n="616">His martial men with fierce harangues he fired ,</l>
     <l n="617">And his own ardour in their souls inspired .</l>
     <l n="618">This done — to give new terror to his foes ,</l>
     <l n="619">The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows ,</l>
     <l n="620">Raised high on pointed spears — a ghastly sight !</l>
     <l n="621">Loud peals of shouts ensue , and barbarous delight .</l>
     <l n="622">Meantime the Trojans run , where danger calls :</l>
     <l n="623">They line their trenches , and they man their walls .</l>
     <l n="624">In front extended to the left they stood :</l>
     <l n="625">Safe was the right , surrounded by the flood .</l>
     <l n="626">But , casting from their towers a frightful view ,</l>
     <l n="627">They saw the faces , which too well they knew ,</l>
     <l n="628">Though then disguised in death , and smeared all o'er</l>
     <l n="629">With filth obscene , and dropping putrid gore .</l>
     <l n="630">Soon hasty fame through the sad city bears</l>
     <l n="631">The mournful message to the mother 's ears .</l>
     <l n="632">An icy cold benumbs her limbs ; she shakes ;</l>
     <l n="633">Her cheeks the blood , her hand the web forsakes .</l>
     <l n="634">She runs the rampires round amidst the war , }</l>
     <l n="635">Nor fears the flying darts : she rends her hair , }</l>
     <l n="636">And fills with loud laments the liquid air . }</l>
     <l n="637">“ Thus , then , my loved Euryalus appears !</l>
     <l n="638">Thus looks the prop of my declining years !</l>
     <l n="639">Was't on this face my famished eyes I fed ?</l>
     <l n="640">Ah ! how unlike the living is the dead !</l>
     <l n="641">And could'st thou leave me , cruel , thus alone ?</l>
     <l n="642">Not one kind kiss from a departing son !</l>
     <l n="643">No look , no last adieu before he went ,</l>
     <l n="644">In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent !</l>
     <l n="645">Cold on the ground , and pressing foreign clay ,</l>
     <l n="646">To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey !</l>
     <l n="647">Nor was I near to close his dying eyes ,</l>
     <l n="648">To wash his wounds , to weep his obsequies ,</l>
     <l n="649">To call about his corpse his crying friends ,</l>
     <l n="650">Or spread the mantle ( made for other ends )</l>
     <l n="651">On his dear body , which I wove with care ,</l>
     <l n="652">Nor did my daily pains or nightly labour spare .</l>
     <l n="653">Where shall I find his corpse ? what earth sustains</l>
     <l n="654">His trunk dismembered , and his cold remains ?</l>
     <l n="655">For this , alas ! I left my needful ease ,</l>
     <l n="656">Exposed my life to winds , and winter seas !</l>
     <l n="657">If any pity touch Rutulian hearts ,</l>
     <l n="658">Here empty all your quivers , all your darts :</l>
     <l n="659">Or , if they fail , thou , Jove , conclude my woe ,</l>
     <l n="660">And send me thunder-struck to shades below ! ”</l>
     <l n="661">Her shrieks and clamours pierce the Trojans ’ ears ,</l>
     <l n="662">Unman their courage , and augment their fears :</l>
     <l n="663">Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain ,</l>
     <l n="664">Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain ,</l>
     <l n="665">But Actor and Idæus jointly sent ,</l>
     <l n="666">To bear the madding mother to her tent .</l>
     <l n="667">And now the trumpets terribly , from far ,</l>
     <l n="668">With rattling clangour , rouse the sleepy war .</l>
     <l n="669">The soldiers ’ shouts succeed the brazen sounds ;</l>
     <l n="670">And heaven , from pole to pole , the noise rebounds .</l>
     <l n="671">The Volscians bear their shields upon their head ,</l>
     <l n="672">And , rushing forward , form a moving shed .</l>
     <l n="673">These fill the ditch ; those pull the bulwarks down ;</l>
     <l n="674">Some raise the ladders ; others scale the town .</l>
     <l n="675">But , where void spaces on the walls appear ,</l>
     <l n="676">Or thin defence , they pour their forces there .</l>
     <l n="677">With poles and missive weapons , from afar ,</l>
     <l n="678">The Trojans keep aloof the rising war .</l>
     <l n="679">Taught , by their ten years ’ siege , defensive fight ,</l>
     <l n="680">They roll down ribs of rocks , an unresisted weight ,</l>
     <l n="681">To break the penthouse with the ponderous blow ,</l>
     <l n="682">Which yet the patient Volscians undergo —</l>
     <l n="683">But could not bear the unequal combat long ;</l>
     <l n="684">For , where the Trojans find the thickest throng ,</l>
     <l n="685">The ruin falls : their shattered shields give way ,</l>
     <l n="686">And their crushed heads become an easy prey .</l>
     <l n="687">They shrink for fear , abated of their rage ,</l>
     <l n="688">Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage —</l>
     <l n="689">Contented now to gall them from below</l>
     <l n="690">With darts and slings , and with the distant bow .</l>
     <l n="691">Elsewhere Mezentius , terrible to view ,</l>
     <l n="692">A blazing pine within the trenches threw .</l>
     <l n="693">But brave Messapus , Neptune 's warlike son , }</l>
     <l n="694">Broke down the palisades , the trenches won , }</l>

     <l n="696">Calliope , begin ! Ye sacred Nine ,</l>
     <l n="697">Inspire your poet in his high design ,</l>
     <l n="698">To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made ,</l>
     <l n="699">What souls he sent below the Stygian shade ,</l>

     <l n="703">You best remember , and alone can tell .</l>
     <l n="704">There stood a tower , amazing to the sight ,</l>
     <l n="705">Built up of beams , and of stupendous height :</l>
     <l n="706">Art , and the nature of the place , conspired</l>
     <l n="707">To furnish all the strength that war required .</l>
     <l n="708">To level this , the bold Italians join ;</l>
     <l n="709">The wary Trojans obviate their design ;</l>
     <l n="710">With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below ,</l>
     <l n="711">Shoot through the loopholes , and sharp javelins throw .</l>
     <l n="712">Turnus , the chief , tossed from his thundering hand ,</l>
     <l n="713">Against the wooden walls , a flaming brand :</l>
     <l n="714">It stuck , the fiery plague ; the winds were high ;</l>
     <l n="715">The planks were seasoned , and the timber dry .</l>
     <l n="716">Contagion caught the posts ; it spread along ,</l>
     <l n="717">Scorched , and to distance drove , the scattered throng .</l>
     <l n="718">The Trojans fled ; the fire pursued amain ,</l>
     <l n="719">Still gathering fast upon the trembling train ;</l>
     <l n="720">Till , crowding to the corners of the wall ,</l>
     <l n="721">Down the defence and the defenders fall .</l>
     <l n="722">The mighty flaw makes heaven itself resound :</l>
     <l n="723">The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground .</l>
     <l n="724">The tower , that followed on the fallen crew ,</l>

     <l n="734">( A privilege which none but freemen share . ) }</l>
     <l n="735">Slight were his arms , a sword and silver shield :</l>
     <l n="736">No marks of honour charged its empty field .</l>
     <l n="737">Light as he fell , so light the youth arose ,</l>
     <l n="738">And rising , found himself amidst his foes ;</l>
     <l n="739">Nor flight was left , nor hopes to force his way .</l>
     <l n="740">Emboldened by despair , he stood at bay ;</l>
     <l n="741">And , like a stag , whom all the troop surrounds</l>
     <l n="742">Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds —</l>
     <l n="743">Resolved on death , he dissipates his fears ,</l>
     <l n="744">And bounds aloft against the pointed spears :</l>
     <l n="745">So dares the youth , secure of death ; and throws</l>
     <l n="746">His dying body on his thickest foes .</l>
     <l n="747">But Lycus , swifter of his feet by far ,</l>
     <l n="748">Runs , doubles , winds , and turns , amidst the war ;</l>
     <l n="749">Springs to the walls , and leaves his foes behind ,</l>
     <l n="750">And snatches at the beam he first can find ;</l>
     <l n="751">Looks up , and leaps aloft at all the stretch ,</l>
     <l n="752">In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach .</l>
     <l n="753">But Turnus followed hard his hunted prey ,</l>
     <l n="754">( His spear had almost reached him in the way ,</l>
     <l n="755">Short of his reins , and scarce a span behind ,)</l>
     <l n="756">“ Fool ! ” said the chief , “ though fleeter than the wind ,</l>
     <l n="757">Could'st thou presume to ‘ scape , when I pursue ? ”</l>
     <l n="758">He said , and downward by the feet he drew</l>
     <l n="759">The trembling dastard ; at the tug he falls ;</l>
     <l n="760">Vast ruins come along rent from the smoking walls .</l>
     <l n="761">Thus on some silver swan , or timorous hare ,</l>
     <l n="762">Jove 's bird comes sowsing down from upper air ;</l>
     <l n="763">Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey :</l>
     <l n="764">Then out of sight she soars , and wings her way .</l>
     <l n="765">So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb ,</l>
     <l n="766">In vain lamented by the bleating dam .</l>
     <l n="767">Then rushing onward with a barbarous cry ,</l>
     <l n="768">The troops of Turnus to the combat fly .</l>
     <l n="769">The ditch with faggots filled , the daring foe</l>
     <l n="770">Tossed firebrands to the steepy turrets throw .</l>
     <l n="771">Ilioneus , as bold Lucetius came</l>
     <l n="772">To force the gate , and feed the kindling flame ,</l>
     <l n="773">Rolled down the fragment of a rock so right ,</l>
     <l n="774">It crushed him double underneath the weight .</l>
     <l n="775">Two more young Liger and Asylas slew : }</l>
     <l n="776">To bend the bow young Liger better knew ; }</l>
     <l n="777">Asylas best the pointed javelin threw . }</l>
     <l n="778">Brave Cæneus laid Ortygius on the plain ;</l>
     <l n="779">The victor Cæneus was by Turnus slain .</l>
     <l n="780">By the same hand , Clonius and Itys fall ,</l>
     <l n="781">Sagar , and Idas standing on the wall .</l>
     <l n="782">From Capys ’ arms his fate Privernus found :</l>
     <l n="783">Hurt by Temilla first — but slight the wound —</l>
     <l n="784">His shield thrown by , to mitigate the smart ,</l>
     <l n="785">He clapped his hand upon the wounded part :</l>
     <l n="786">The second shaft came swift and unespied ,</l>
     <l n="787">And pierced his hand , and nailed it to his side ,</l>
     <l n="788">Transfixed his breathing lungs , and beating heart :</l>
     <l n="789">The soul came issuing out , and hissed against the dart .</l>
     <l n="790">The son of Arcens shone amid the rest ,</l>
     <l n="791">In glittering armour and a purple vest ,</l>
     <l n="792">( Fair was his face , his eyes inspiring love ,)</l>
     <l n="793">Bred by his father in the Martian grove ,</l>
     <l n="794">Where the fat altars of Palicus flame ,</l>
     <l n="795">And sent in arms to purchase early fame .</l>
     <l n="796">Him when he spied from far , the Tuscan king</l>
     <l n="797">Laid by the lance , and took him to the sling ,</l>
     <l n="798">Thrice whirled the thong around his head , and threw ;</l>
     <l n="799">The heated lead half melted as it flew :</l>
     <l n="800">It pierced his hollow temples and his brain ;</l>
     <l n="801">The youth came tumbling down , and spurned the plain .</l>
     <l n="802">Then young Ascanius , who , before this day ,</l>
     <l n="803">Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey ,</l>
     <l n="804">First bent in martial strife the twanging bow ,</l>
     <l n="805">And exercised against a human foe —</l>
     <l n="806">With this bereft Numanus of his life ,</l>
     <l n="807">Who Turnus ’ younger sister took to wife .</l>
     <l n="808">Proud of his realm , and of his royal bride , }</l>
     <l n="809">Vaunting before his troops , and lengthened with a stride , }</l>
     <l n="810">In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied :— }</l>
     <l n="811">“ Twice-conquered cowards ! now your shame is shown —</l>
     <l n="812">Cooped up a second time within your town !</l>
     <l n="813">Who dare not issue forth in open field ,</l>
     <l n="814">But hold your walls before you for a shield .</l>
     <l n="815">Thus threat you war ? thus our alliance force ?</l>
     <l n="816">What gods , what madness , hither steered your course ?</l>
     <l n="817">You shall not find the sons of Atreus here ,</l>
     <l n="818">Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear .</l>
     <l n="819">Strong from the cradle , of a sturdy brood ,</l>
     <l n="820">We bear our new-born infants to the flood ;</l>
     <l n="821">There bathed amid the stream , our boys we hold ,</l>
     <l n="822">With winter hardened , and inured to cold .</l>
     <l n="823">They wake before the day to range the wood ,</l>
     <l n="824">Kill ere they eat , nor taste unconquered food .</l>
     <l n="825">No sports , but what belong to war , they know —</l>
     <l n="826">To break the stubborn colt , to bend the bow .</l>
     <l n="827">Our youth , of labour patient , earn their bread ;</l>
     <l n="828">Hardly they work , with frugal diet fed .</l>
     <l n="829">From ploughs and harrows sent to seek renown ,</l>
     <l n="830">They fight in fields , and storm the shaken town .</l>
     <l n="831">No part of life from toils of war is free ,</l>
     <l n="832">No change in age , or difference in degree .</l>
     <l n="833">We plough and till in arms : our oxen feel ,</l>
     <l n="834">Instead of goads , the spur and pointed steel :</l>
     <l n="835">The inverted lance makes furrows in the plain .</l>
     <l n="836">Even time , that changes all , yet changes us in vain —</l>
     <l n="837">The body , not the mind — nor can controul</l>
     <l n="838">The immortal vigour , or abate the soul .</l>
     <l n="839">Our helms defend the young , disguise the grey :</l>
     <l n="840">We live by plunder , and delight in prey .</l>
     <l n="841">Your vests embroidered with rich purple shine ;</l>
     <l n="842">In sloth you glory , and in dances join .</l>
     <l n="843">Your vests have sweeping sleeves : with female pride ,</l>
     <l n="844">Your turbans underneath your chins are tied .</l>
     <l n="845">Go , Phrygians , to your Dindymus agen !</l>
     <l n="846">Go , less than women , in the shapes of men !</l>
     <l n="847">Go ! mixed with eunuchs in the Mother 's rites ,</l>
     <l n="848">( Where with unequal sound the flute invites ,)</l>
     <l n="849">Sing , dance , and howl , by turns , in Ida 's shade :</l>
     <l n="850">Resign the war to men , who know the martial trade . ”</l>
     <l n="851">This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear</l>
     <l n="852">With patience , or a vowed revenge forbear .</l>
     <l n="853">At the full stretch of both his hands , he drew ,</l>
     <l n="854">And almost joined , the horns of the tough yew .<span corresp="#note4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
     <l n="855">But , first , before the throne of Jove he stood ,</l>
     <l n="856">And thus with lifted hands invoked the god :—</l>
     <l n="857">“ My first attempt , great Jupiter , succeed !</l>
     <l n="858">An annual offering in thy grove shall bleed ,</l>
     <l n="859">A snow-white steer , before thy altar led ,</l>
     <l n="860">Who , like his mother , bears aloft his head ,</l>
     <l n="861">Butts with his threatening brows , and bellowing stands ,</l>
     <l n="862">And dares the fight , and spurns the yellow sands . ”</l>
     <l n="863">Jove bowed the heavens , and lent a gracious ear ,</l>
     <l n="864">And thundered on the left , amidst the clear .</l>
     <l n="865">Sounded at once the bow ; and swiftly flies</l>
     <l n="866">The feathered death , and hisses through the skies .</l>
     <l n="867">The steel through both his temples forced the way :</l>
     <l n="868">Extended on the ground , Numanus lay .</l>
     <l n="869">“ Go now , vain boaster ! and true valour scorn !</l>
     <l n="870">The Phrygians , twice subdued , yet make this third return . ”</l>
     <l n="871">Ascanius said no more . The Trojans shake</l>
     <l n="872">The heavens with shouting , and new vigour take .</l>
     <l n="873">Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud , }</l>
     <l n="874">To view the feats of arms , and fighting crowd ; }</l>
     <l n="875">And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud :— }</l>
     <l n="876">“ Advance , illustrious youth ! increase in fame ,</l>
     <l n="877">And wide from east to west extend thy name —</l>
     <l n="878">Offspring of gods thyself ; and Rome shall owe</l>
     <l n="879">To thee a race of demigods below .</l>
     <l n="880">This is the way to heaven : the powers divine</l>
     <l n="881">From this beginning date the Julian line .</l>
     <l n="882">To thee , to them , and their victorious heirs ,</l>
     <l n="883">The conquered war is due , and the vast world is theirs .</l>
     <l n="884">Troy is too narrow for thy name . ” He said ,</l>
     <l n="885">And plunging downward shot his radiant head ;</l>
     <l n="886">Dispelled the breathing air , that broke his flight :</l>
     <l n="887">Shorn of his beams , a man to mortal sight ,</l>
     <l n="888">Old Butes ’ form he took , Anchises ’ squire ,</l>
     <l n="889">Now left , to rule Ascanius , by his sire :</l>
     <l n="890">His wrinkled visage , and his hoary hairs , }</l>
     <l n="891">His mien , his habit , and his arms , he wears , }</l>
     <l n="892">And thus salutes the boy , too forward for his years :— }</l>
     <l n="893">“ Suffice it thee , thy father 's worthy son ,</l>
     <l n="894">The warlike prize thou hast already won .</l>
     <l n="895">The god of archers gives thy youth a part</l>
     <l n="896">Of his own praise , nor envies equal art .</l>
     <l n="897">Now tempt the war no more . ” He said , and flew</l>
     <l n="898">Obscure in air , and vanished from their view .</l>
     <l n="899">The Trojans , by his arms , their patron know ,</l>
     <l n="900">And hear the twanging of his heavenly bow .</l>
     <l n="901">Then duteous force they use , and Phœbus ’ name ,</l>
     <l n="902">To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame .</l>
     <l n="903">Undaunted , they themselves no danger shun ;</l>
     <l n="904">From wall to wall , the shouts and clamours run ;</l>
     <l n="905">They bend their bows ; they whirl their slings around ; }</l>
     <l n="906">Heaps of spent arrows fall , and strew the ground ; }</l>
     <l n="907">And helms , and shields , and rattling arms , resound . }</l>
     <l n="908">The combat thickens , like the storm that flies</l>
     <l n="909">From westward , when the showery Kids arise ;</l>
     <l n="910">Or pattering hail comes pouring on the main ,</l>
     <l n="911">When Jupiter descends in hardened rain ,</l>
     <l n="912">Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound ,</l>
     <l n="913">And with an armed winter strew the ground .</l>
     <l n="914">Pand'rus and Bitias , thunder-bolts of war ,</l>
     <l n="915">Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare</l>
     <l n="916">On Ida 's top — two youths of height and size</l>
     <l n="917">Like firs that on their mother mountain rise —</l>
     <l n="918">Presuming on their force , the gates unbar ,</l>
     <l n="919">And of their own accord invite the war ,</l>
     <l n="920">With fates averse , against their king 's command .</l>
     <l n="921">Armed , on the right and on the left they stand ,</l>
     <l n="922">And flank the passage : shining steel they wear ,</l>
     <l n="923">And waving crests above their heads appear .</l>
     <l n="924">Thus two tall oaks , that Padus ’ banks adorn ,</l>
     <l n="925">Lift up to heaven their leafy heads unshorn ,</l>
     <l n="926">And , overpressed with nature 's heavy load ,</l>
     <l n="927">Dance to the whistling winds , and at each other nod .</l>
     <l n="928">In flows a tide of Latians , when they see</l>
     <l n="929">The gate set open , and the passage free ;</l>
     <l n="930">Bold Quercens , with rash Tmarus , rushing on ,</l>
     <l n="931">Aquicolus , that in bright armour shone ,</l>
     <l n="932">And Hæmon first : but soon repulsed they fly ,</l>
     <l n="933">Or in the well-defended pass they die .</l>
     <l n="934">These with success are fired , and those with rage ,</l>
     <l n="935">And each on equal terms at length engage .</l>
     <l n="936">Drawn from their lines , and issuing on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="937">The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain .</l>
     <l n="938">Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought ,</l>
     <l n="939">When suddenly the unhoped-for news was brought ,</l>
     <l n="940">The foes had left the fastness of their place ,</l>
     <l n="941">Prevailed in fight , and had his men in chase .</l>
     <l n="942">He quits the attack , and , to prevent their fate ,</l>
     <l n="943">Runs , where the giant brothers guard the gate .</l>
     <l n="944">The first he met , Antiphates the brave ,</l>
     <l n="945">( But base-begotten on a Theban slave —</l>
     <l n="946">Sarpedon 's son ) he slew : the deadly dart</l>
     <l n="947">Found passage through his breast , and pierced his heart .</l>
     <l n="948">Fixed in the wound the Italian cornel stood ,</l>
     <l n="949">Warmed in his lungs , and in his vital blood .</l>
     <l n="950">Aphidnus next , and Erymanthus dies , }</l>
     <l n="951">And Meropes , and the gigantic size }</l>

     <l n="958">Nor coat of double mail , with scales of gold .</l>
     <l n="959">Down sunk the monster-bulk , and pressed the ground ,</l>
     <l n="960">( His arms and clattering shield on the vast body sound ,)</l>
     <l n="961">Not with less ruin than the Baian mole ,</l>
     <l n="962">Raised on the seas , the surges to controul —</l>
     <l n="963">At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall ;</l>
     <l n="964">Prone to the deep , the stones disjointed fall</l>
     <l n="965">Of the vast pile ; the scattered ocean flies ;</l>
     <l n="966">Black sands , discoloured froth , and mingled mud , arise :</l>
     <l n="967">The frighted billows roll , and seek the shores :</l>
     <l n="968">Then trembles Prochyta , then Ischia roars :</l>
     <l n="969">Typhöeus , thrown beneath by Jove 's command ,</l>
     <l n="970">Astonished at the flaw that shakes the land ,</l>
     <l n="971">Soon shifts his weary side , and , scarce awake ,</l>
     <l n="972">With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back .</l>
     <l n="973">The warrior god the Latian troops inspired ,</l>
     <l n="974">New strung their sinews , and their courage fired ,</l>
     <l n="975">But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright :</l>
     <l n="976">Then black despair precipitates their flight .</l>
     <l n="977">When Pandarus beheld his brother killed ,</l>
     <l n="978">The town with fear and wild confusion filled ,</l>
     <l n="979">He turns the hinges of the heavy gate</l>
     <l n="980">With both his hands , and adds his shoulders to the weight ;</l>
     <l n="981">Some happier friends within the walls inclosed ;</l>
     <l n="982">The rest shut out , to certain death exposed :</l>
     <l n="983">Fool as he was , and frantic in his care ,</l>
     <l n="984">To admit young Turnus , and include the war !</l>
     <l n="985">He thrust amid the crowd , securely bold ,</l>
     <l n="986">Like a fierce tyger pent amid the fold .</l>
     <l n="987">Too late his blazing buckler they descry ,</l>
     <l n="988">And sparkling fires that shot from either eye ,</l>
     <l n="989">His mighty members , and his ample breast ,</l>
     <l n="990">His rattling armour , and his crimson crest .</l>
     <l n="991">Far from that hated face the Trojans fly ,</l>
     <l n="992">All but the fool who sought his destiny .</l>
     <l n="993">Mad Pandarus steps forth , with vengeance vowed</l>
     <l n="994">For Bitias ’ death , and threatens thus aloud :—</l>
     <l n="995">“ These are not Ardea 's walls , nor this the town</l>

     <l n="997">‘ Tis hostile earth you tread . Of hope bereft ,</l>
     <l n="998">No means of safe return by flight are left . ”</l>
     <l n="999">To whom , with countenance calm , and soul sedate ,</l>
     <l n="1000">Thus Turnus :— “ Then begin , and try thy fate :</l>
     <l n="1001">My message to the ghost of Priam bear ;</l>
     <l n="1002">Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there . ”</l>
     <l n="1003">A lance of tough ground-ash the Trojan threw ,</l>
     <l n="1004">Rough in the rind , and knotted as it grew :</l>
     <l n="1005">With his full force he whirled it first around ;</l>
     <l n="1006">But the soft yielding air received the wound :</l>
     <l n="1007">Imperial Juno turned the course before ,</l>
     <l n="1008">And fixed the wandering weapon in the door .</l>
     <l n="1009">“ But hope not thou , ” said Turnus , “ when I strike ,</l>
     <l n="1010">To shun thy fate : our force is not alike ,</l>
     <l n="1011">Nor thy steel tempered by the Lemnian god . ”</l>
     <l n="1012">Then rising , on his utmost stretch he stood ,</l>
     <l n="1013">And aimed from high : the full descending blow</l>
     <l n="1014">Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two .</l>
     <l n="1015">Down sinks the giant with a thundering sound : }</l>
     <l n="1016">His ponderous limbs oppress the trembling ground ; }</l>
     <l n="1017">Blood , brains , and foam , gush from the gaping wound . }</l>
     <l n="1018">Scalp , face , and shoulders , the keen steel divides ;</l>
     <l n="1019">And the shared visage hangs on equal sides .</l>
     <l n="1020">The Trojans fly from their approaching fate :</l>
     <l n="1021">And , had the victor then secured the gate ,</l>
     <l n="1022">And , to his troops without , unclosed the bars ,</l>
     <l n="1023">One lucky day had ended all his wars .</l>
     <l n="1024">But boiling youth , and blind desire of blood ,</l>

     <l n="1026">Hamstringed behind , unhappy Gyges died ;</l>
     <l n="1027">Then Phalaris is added to his side .</l>
     <l n="1028">The pointed javelins from the dead he drew ,</l>
     <l n="1029">And their friends ’ arms against their fellows threw .</l>
     <l n="1030">Strong Halys stands in vain ; weak Phegeus flies ;</l>
     <l n="1031">Saturnia , still at hand , new force and fire supplies .</l>
     <l n="1032">Then Halius , Prytanis , Alcander fall —</l>
     <l n="1033">Engaged against the foes who scaled the wall :</l>
     <l n="1034">But , whom they feared without , they found within .</l>
     <l n="1035">At last , though late , by Lynceus he was seen .</l>
     <l n="1036">He calls new succours , and assaults the prince :</l>
     <l n="1037">But weak his force , and vain is their defence .</l>
     <l n="1038">Turned to the right , his sword the hero drew ,</l>
     <l n="1039">And at one blow the bold aggressor slew .</l>
     <l n="1040">He joints the neck ; and , with a stroke so strong ,</l>
     <l n="1041">The helm flies off , and bears the head along .</l>
     <l n="1042">Next him , the huntsman Amycus he killed ,</l>
     <l n="1043">In darts envenomed and in poison skilled .</l>
     <l n="1044">Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear ,</l>
     <l n="1045">And Cretheus , whom the Muses held so dear :</l>
     <l n="1046">He fought with courage , and he sung the fight ;</l>
     <l n="1047">Arms were his business , verses his delight .</l>
     <l n="1048">The Trojan chiefs behold , with rage and grief ,</l>
     <l n="1049">Their slaughtered friends , and hasten their relief .</l>
     <l n="1050">Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train ,</l>
     <l n="1051">Whom brave Serestus and his troop sustain .</l>
     <l n="1052">To save the living , and revenge the dead ,</l>
     <l n="1053">Against one warrior 's arms all Troy they led .</l>
     <l n="1054">“ O , void of sense and courage ! ” Mnestheus cried ,</l>
     <l n="1055">“ Where can you hope your coward heads to hide ?</l>
     <l n="1056">Ah ! where beyond these rampires can you run ?</l>
     <l n="1057">One man , and in your camp inclosed , you shun !</l>
     <l n="1058">Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast ,</l>
     <l n="1059">And pass unpunished from a numerous host ?</l>
     <l n="1060">Forsaking honour , and renouncing fame ,</l>
     <l n="1061">Your gods , your country , and your king , you shame ! ”</l>
     <l n="1062">This just reproach their virtue does excite :</l>
     <l n="1063">They stand , they join , they thicken to the fight .</l>
     <l n="1064">Now Turnus doubts , and yet disdains to yield ,</l>
     <l n="1065">But with slow paces measures back the field ,</l>
     <l n="1066">And inches to the walls , where Tyber 's tide ,</l>
     <l n="1067">Washing the camp , defends the weaker side .</l>
     <l n="1068">The more he loses , they advance the more ,</l>
     <l n="1069">And tread in every step he trod before .</l>
     <l n="1070">They shout ; they bear him back ; and , whom by might</l>
     <l n="1071">They cannot conquer , they oppress with weight .</l>
     <l n="1072">As , compassed with a wood of spears around ,</l>
     <l n="1073">The lordly lion still maintains his ground ;</l>
     <l n="1074">Grins horrible , retires , and turns again ;</l>
     <l n="1075">Threats his distended paws , and shakes his mane ;</l>
     <l n="1076">He loses while in vain he presses on ,</l>
     <l n="1077">Nor will his courage let him dare to run :</l>
     <l n="1078">So Turnus fares , and , unresolved of flight ,</l>
     <l n="1079">Moves tardy back , and just recedes from fight .</l>
     <l n="1080">Yet twice , enraged , the combat he renews ,</l>
     <l n="1081">Twice breaks , and twice his broken foes pursues .</l>
     <l n="1082">But now they swarm , and , with fresh troops supplied ,</l>
     <l n="1083">Come rolling on , and rush from every side :</l>
     <l n="1084">Nor Juno , who sustained his arms before ,</l>
     <l n="1085">Dares with new strength suffice the exhausted store ;</l>
     <l n="1086">For Jove , with sour commands , sent Iris down ,</l>
     <l n="1087">To force the invader from the frighted town .</l>
     <l n="1088">With labour spent , no longer can he wield</l>
     <l n="1089">The heavy faulchion , or sustain the shield ,</l>
     <l n="1090">O'erwhelmed with darts , which from afar they fling :</l>
     <l n="1091">The weapons round his hollow temples ring :</l>
     <l n="1092">His golden helm gives way , with stony blows</l>
     <l n="1093">Battered , and flat , and beaten to his brows .</l>
     <l n="1094">His crest is rashed away ; his ample shield</l>
     <l n="1095">Is falsified , and round with javelins filled .<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
     <l n="1096">The foe , now faint , the Trojans overwhelm ;</l>
     <l n="1097">And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm .</l>
     <l n="1098">Sick sweat succeeds ; he drops at every pore ;</l>
     <l n="1099">With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er ;</l>
     <l n="1100">Shorter and shorter every gasp he takes ;</l>
     <l n="1101">And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes .</l>
     <l n="1102">Armed as he was , at length he leaped from high ,</l>
     <l n="1103">Plunged in the flood , and made the waters fly .</l>
     <l n="1104">The yellow god the welcome burden bore ,</l>
     <l n="1105">And wiped the sweat , and washed away the gore ;</l>
     <l n="1106">Then gently wafts him to the farther coast ,</l>
     <l n="1107">And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host .</l>

     <l n="2">At the full stretch of both his hands , he drew ,</l>
     <l n="3">And almost joined , the horns of the tough yew .— P . 54 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The first of these lines is all of monosyllables , and both verses are very rough , but of choice ; for it had been easy for me to have smoothed them . But either my ear deceives me , or they express the thing which I intended in their sound : for the stress of a bow , which is drawn to the full extent , is expressed in the harshness of the first verse , clogged not only with monosyllables , but with consonants ; and these words , the tough yew , which conclude the second line , seem as forceful , as they are unharmonious . Homer and Virgil are both frequent in their adapting sounds to the thing they signify . One example will serve for both ; because Virgil borrowed the following verses from Homer 's Odysses .</p>

     <l n="1">—— —— —— —— His ample shield</l>
     <l n="2">Is falsified , and round with javelins filled .— P . 61 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When I read this Æneïd to many of my friends in company together , most of them quarrelled at the word falsified , as an innovation in our language . The fact is confessed ; for I remember not to have read it in any English author , though perhaps it may be found in Spenser 's “ Fairy Queen ; ” but , suppose it be not there , why am I forbidden to borrow from the Italian ( a polished language ) the word which is wanting in my native tongue ? Terence has often Grecised ; Lucretius has followed his example , and pleaded for it —</p>
   <p>Sic quia me cogit patrii sermonis egestus .</p>
   <p>Virgil has confirmed it by his frequent practice ; and even Cicero in prose , wanting terms of philosophy in the Latin tongue , has taken them from Aristotle 's Greek . Horace has given us a rule for coining words , si Græco fonte cadant ; especially , when other words are joined with them , which explain the sense . I use the word falsify in this place , to mean , that the shield of Turnus was not of proof against the spears and javelins of the Trojans , which had pierced it through and through ( as we say ) in many places . The words which accompany this new one , make my meaning plain , according to the precept which Horace gave . But I said I borrowed the word from the Italian . Vide Ariosto , Cant . 26 .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ma sì l'usbergo d'ambi era perfetto ,</l>
     <l n="2">Che mai poter falsarlo in nessun canto .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Falsar cannot otherwise be turned , than by falsified ; for his shield was falsed , is not English . I might indeed have contented myself with saying , his shield was pierced , and bored , and stuck with javelins , nec sufficit umbo ictibus . They , who will not admit a new word , may take the old ; the matter is not worth dispute .</p>

    <head>ÆNEÏS ,</head>
    <head>BOOK X .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Jupiter , calling a council of the gods , forbids them to engage in either party . At Æneas 's return there is a bloody battle : Turnus killing Pallas ; Æneas , Lausus and Mezentius . Mezentius is described as an atheist ; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth . The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode .</head>
     <l n="1">The gates of heaven unfold : Jove summons all</l>
     <l n="2">The gods to council in the common hall .</l>
     <l n="3">Sublimely seated , he surveys from far</l>
     <l n="4">The fields , the camp , the fortune of the war ,</l>
     <l n="5">And all the inferior world . From first to last ,</l>
     <l n="6">The sovereign senate in degrees are placed .</l>
     <l n="7">Then thus the almighty sire began :— “ Ye gods ,</l>
     <l n="8">Natives or denizens of blest abodes !</l>
     <l n="9">From whence these murmurs , and this change of mind ,</l>
     <l n="10">This backward fate from what was first designed ?</l>
     <l n="11">Why thus protracted war , when my commands</l>
     <l n="12">Pronounced a peace , and gave the Latian lands ?</l>
     <l n="13">What fear or hope on either part divides</l>
     <l n="14">Our heavens , and arms our powers on different sides ?</l>
     <l n="15">A lawful time of war at length will come ,</l>
     <l n="16">( Nor need your haste anticipate the doom ,)</l>
     <l n="17">When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome ;</l>
     <l n="18">Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains ,</l>
     <l n="19">And , like a flood , come pouring on the plains .</l>
     <l n="20">Then is your time for faction and debate ,</l>
     <l n="21">For partial favour , and permitted hate .</l>
     <l n="22">Let now your immature dissention cease ;</l>
     <l n="23">Sit quiet , and compose your souls to peace . ”</l>
     <l n="24">Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge ;</l>
     <l n="25">But lovely Venus thus replies at large :—</l>
     <l n="26">“ O power immense ! eternal energy !</l>
     <l n="27">( For to what else protection can we fly ? )</l>
     <l n="28">Seest thou the proud Rutulians , how they dare</l>
     <l n="29">In fields , unpunished , and insult my care ?</l>
     <l n="30">How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train ,</l>
     <l n="31">In shining arms triumphant on the plain ?</l>
     <l n="32">Even in their lines and trenches they contend ,</l>
     <l n="33">And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend :</l>
     <l n="34">The town is filled with slaughter , and o'erfloats ,</l>
     <l n="35">With a red deluge , their increasing moats .</l>
     <l n="36">Æneas , ignorant , and far from thence ,</l>
     <l n="37">Has left a camp exposed , without defence .</l>
     <l n="38">This endless outrage shall they still sustain ?</l>
     <l n="39">Shall Troy renewed be forced and fired again ?</l>
     <l n="40">A second siege my banished issue fears ,</l>
     <l n="41">And a new Diomede in arms appears .</l>
     <l n="42">One more audacious mortal will be found ;</l>
     <l n="43">And I , thy daughter , wait another wound .</l>
     <l n="44">Yet , if , with fates averse , without thy leave ,</l>
     <l n="45">The Latian lands my progeny receive ,</l>
     <l n="46">Bear they the pains of violated law ,</l>
     <l n="47">And thy protection from their aid withdraw .</l>
     <l n="48">But , if the gods their sure success foretell —</l>
     <l n="49">If those of heaven consent with those of hell ,</l>
     <l n="50">To promise Italy ; who dare debate</l>
     <l n="51">The power of Jove , or fix another fate ?</l>
     <l n="52">What should I tell of tempests on the main ,</l>
     <l n="53">Of Æolus usurping Neptune 's reign ?</l>
     <l n="54">Of Iris sent , with Bacchanalian heat</l>
     <l n="55">To inspire the matrons , and destroy the fleet ?</l>
     <l n="56">Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends ,</l>
     <l n="57">Solicits hell for aid , and arms the fiends .</l>
     <l n="58">That new example wanted yet above —</l>
     <l n="59">An act that well became the wife of Jove !</l>
     <l n="60">Alecto , raised by her , with rage inflames</l>
     <l n="61">The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames .</l>
     <l n="62">Imperial sway no more exalts my mind ;</l>
     <l n="63">( Such hopes I had indeed , while heaven was kind ,)</l>
     <l n="64">Now let my happier foes possess my place , }</l>
     <l n="65">Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race ; }</l>
     <l n="66">And conquer they , whom you with conquest grace . }</l>
     <l n="67">Since you can spare , from all your wide command ,</l>
     <l n="68">No spot of earth , no hospitable land ,</l>
     <l n="69">Which may my wandering fugitives receive ;</l>
     <l n="70">( Since haughty Juno will not give you leave ,)</l>
     <l n="71">Then , father , ( if I still may use that name ,)</l>
     <l n="72">By ruined Troy , yet smoking from the flame ,</l>
     <l n="73">I beg you , let Ascanius , by my care ,</l>
     <l n="74">Be freed from danger , and dismissed the war :</l>
     <l n="75">Inglorious let him live , without a crown : }</l>
     <l n="76">The father may be cast on coasts unknown , }</l>
     <l n="77">Struggling with fate ; but let me save the son . }</l>
     <l n="78">Mine is Cythera , mine the Cyprian towers :</l>
     <l n="79">In those recesses , and those sacred bowers ,</l>
     <l n="80">Obscurely let him rest ; his right resign</l>
     <l n="81">To promised empire , and his Julian line .</l>
     <l n="82">Then Carthage may the Ausonian towns destroy ,</l>
     <l n="83">Nor fear the race of a rejected boy .</l>
     <l n="84">What profits it my son , to ‘ scape the fire ,</l>
     <l n="85">Armed with his gods , and loaded with his sire ;</l>
     <l n="86">To pass the perils of the seas and wind ;</l>
     <l n="87">Evade the Greeks , and leave the war behind ;</l>
     <l n="88">To reach the Italian shores ; if , after all ,</l>
     <l n="89">Our second Pergamus is doomed to fall ?</l>
     <l n="90">Much better had he curbed his high desires ,</l>
     <l n="91">And hovered o'er his ill-extinguished fires .</l>
     <l n="92">To Simoïs ’ banks the fugitives restore ,</l>
     <l n="93">And give them back to war , and all the woes before . ”</l>
     <l n="94">Deep indignation swelled Saturnia 's heart :</l>
     <l n="95">“ And must I own , ” she said , “ my secret smart —</l>
     <l n="96">What with more decence were in silence kept ,</l>
     <l n="97">And , but for this unjust reproach , had slept ?</l>
     <l n="98">Did god or man your favourite son advise ,</l>
     <l n="99">With war unhoped the Latians to surprise ?</l>
     <l n="100">By fate , you boast , and by the gods ’ decree ,</l>
     <l n="101">He left his native land for Italy !</l>
     <l n="102">Confess the truth ; by mad Cassandra , more</l>
     <l n="103">Than heaven , inspired , he sought a foreign shore .</l>
     <l n="104">Did I persuade to trust his second Troy</l>
     <l n="105">To the raw conduct of a beardless boy ,</l>
     <l n="106">With walls unfinished , which himself forsakes ,</l>
     <l n="107">And through the waves a wandering voyage takes ?</l>
     <l n="108">When have I urged him meanly to demand</l>
     <l n="109">The Tuscan aid , and arm a quiet land ?</l>
     <l n="110">Did I or Iris give this mad advice ?</l>
     <l n="111">Or made the fool himself the fatal choice ?</l>
     <l n="112">You think it hard , the Latians should destroy</l>
     <l n="113">With swords your Trojans , and with fires your Troy !</l>
     <l n="114">Hard and unjust indeed , for men to draw</l>
     <l n="115">Their native air , nor take a foreign law !</l>
     <l n="116">That Turnus is permitted still to live ,</l>
     <l n="117">To whom his birth a god and goddess give !</l>
     <l n="118">But yet ‘ tis just and lawful for your line</l>
     <l n="119">To drive their fields , and force with fraud to join ;</l>
     <l n="120">Realms , not your own , among your clans divide ,</l>
     <l n="121">And from the bridegroom tear the promised bride ;</l>
     <l n="122">Petition , while you public arms prepare ;</l>
     <l n="123">Pretend a peace , and yet provoke a war !</l>
     <l n="124">‘ Twas given to you , your darling son to shroud , }</l>
     <l n="125">To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd , }</l>
     <l n="126">And , for a man , obtend an empty cloud . }</l>
     <l n="127">From flaming fleets you turned the fire away ,</l>
     <l n="128">And changed the ships to daughters of the sea .</l>
     <l n="129">But ‘ tis my crime — the queen of heaven offends ,</l>
     <l n="130">If she presume to save her suffering friends !</l>
     <l n="131">Your son , not knowing what his foes decree ,</l>
     <l n="132">You say , is absent : absent let him be .</l>
     <l n="133">Yours is Cythera , yours the Cyprian towers ,</l>
     <l n="134">The soft recesses , and the sacred bowers .</l>
     <l n="135">Why do you then these needless arms prepare ,</l>
     <l n="136">And thus provoke a people prone to war ?</l>
     <l n="137">Did I with fire the Trojan town deface ,</l>
     <l n="138">Or hinder from return your exiled race ?</l>
     <l n="139">Was I the cause of mischief , or the man ,</l>
     <l n="140">Whose lawless lust the fatal war began ?</l>
     <l n="141">Think on whose faith the adulterous youth relied ;</l>
     <l n="142">Who promised , who procured , the Spartan bride ?</l>
     <l n="143">When all the united states of Greece combined ,</l>
     <l n="144">To purge the world of the perfidious kind ,</l>
     <l n="145">Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate :—</l>
     <l n="146">Your quarrels and complaints are now too late . ”</l>
     <l n="147">Thus Juno . Murmurs rise , with mixed applause ,</l>
     <l n="148">Just as they favour or dislike the cause .</l>
     <l n="149">So winds , when yet unfledged in woods they lie ,</l>
     <l n="150">In whispers first their tender voices try ,</l>
     <l n="151">Then issue on the main with bellowing rage ,</l>
     <l n="152">And storms to trembling mariners presage .</l>
     <l n="153">Then thus to both replied the imperial god ,</l>
     <l n="154">Who shakes heaven 's axles with his awful nod .</l>
     <l n="155">( When he begins , the silent senate stand ,</l>
     <l n="156">With reverence listening to the dread command :</l>
     <l n="157">The clouds dispel ; the winds their breath restrain ;</l>
     <l n="158">And the hushed waves lie flatted on the main . )</l>
     <l n="159">“ Celestials ! your attentive ears incline ! }</l>
     <l n="160">Since ( said the god ) the Trojans must not join }</l>
     <l n="161">In wished alliance with the Latian line — }</l>
     <l n="162">Since endless jarrings and immortal hate , }</l>
     <l n="163">Tend but to discompose our happy state — }</l>
     <l n="164">The war henceforward be resigned to fate : }</l>
     <l n="165">Each to his proper fortune stand or fall ;</l>
     <l n="166">Equal and unconcerned I look on all .</l>
     <l n="167">Rutulians , Trojans , are the same to me ;</l>
     <l n="168">And both shall draw the lots their fates decree .</l>
     <l n="169">Let these assault , if Fortune be their friend ;</l>
     <l n="170">And , if she favours those , let those defend :—</l>
     <l n="171">The fates will find their way . ” The Thunderer said ;</l>
     <l n="172">And shook the sacred honours of his head ,</l>
     <l n="173">Attesting Styx , the inviolable flood , }</l>
     <l n="174">And the black regions of his brother god . }</l>
     <l n="175">Trembled the poles of heaven , and earth confessed the nod . }</l>
     <l n="176">This end the sessions had : the senate rise ,</l>
     <l n="177">And to his palace wait their sovereign through the skies .</l>
     <l n="178">Meantime , intent upon their siege , the foes</l>
     <l n="179">Within their walls the Trojan host inclose :</l>
     <l n="180">They wound , they kill , they watch at every gate ;</l>
     <l n="181">Renew the fires , and urge their happy fate .</l>
     <l n="182">The Æneans wish in vain their wanted chief ,</l>
     <l n="183">Hopeless of flight , more hopeless of relief .</l>
     <l n="184">Thin on the towers they stand ; and even those few ,</l>
     <l n="185">A feeble , fainting , and dejected crew .</l>
     <l n="186">Yet in the face of danger some there stood :</l>
     <l n="187">The two bold brothers of Sarpedon 's blood ,</l>
     <l n="188">Asius , and Acmon : both the Assaraci ;</l>
     <l n="189">Young Hæmon , and , though young , resolved to die .</l>
     <l n="190">With these were Clarus and Thymœtes joined ;</l>
     <l n="191">Thymbris and Castor , both of Lycian kind .</l>
     <l n="192">From Acmon 's hands a rolling stone there came ,</l>
     <l n="193">So large , it half deserved a mountain 's name !</l>
     <l n="194">Strong-sinewed was the youth , and big of bone : }</l>
     <l n="195">His brother Mnestheus could not more have done , }</l>
     <l n="196">Or the great father of the intrepid son . }</l>
     <l n="197">Some firebrands throw , some flights of arrows send ;</l>
     <l n="198">And some with darts , and some with stones , defend .</l>
     <l n="199">Amid the press appears the beauteous boy ,</l>
     <l n="200">The care of Venus , and the hope of Troy .</l>
     <l n="201">His lovely face unarmed , his head was bare ;</l>
     <l n="202">In ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair .</l>
     <l n="203">His forehead circled with a diadem ;</l>
     <l n="204">Distinguished from the crowd , he shines a gem ,</l>
     <l n="205">Enchased in gold , or polished ivory set ,</l>
     <l n="206">Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet .</l>
     <l n="207">Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war ,</l>
     <l n="208">Directing ointed arrows from afar ,</l>
     <l n="209">And death with poison armed — in Lydia born ,</l>
     <l n="210">Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn ;</l>
     <l n="211">Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands ,</l>
     <l n="212">And leaves a rich manure of golden sands .</l>
     <l n="213">There Capys , author of the Capuan name , }</l>
     <l n="214">And there was Mnestheus too , increased in fame , }</l>
     <l n="215">Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame . }</l>
     <l n="216">Thus mortal war was waged on either side .</l>
     <l n="217">Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide :</l>
     <l n="218">For , anxious , from Evander when he went ,</l>
     <l n="219">He sought the Tyrrhene camp , and Tarchon 's tent ;</l>
     <l n="220">Exposed the cause of coming to the chief ;</l>
     <l n="221">His name and country told , and asked relief ;</l>
     <l n="222">Proposed the terms ; his own small strength declared ;</l>
     <l n="223">What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepared ;</l>
     <l n="224">What Turnus , bold and violent , designed ;</l>
     <l n="225">Then shewed the slippery state of human-kind ,</l>
     <l n="226">And fickle fortune ; warned him to beware ,</l>
     <l n="227">And to his wholesome counsel added prayer .</l>
     <l n="228">Tarchon , without delay , the treaty signs ,</l>
     <l n="229">And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins .</l>
     <l n="230">They soon set sail ; nor now the Fates withstand ;</l>
     <l n="231">Their forces trusted with a foreign hand .</l>

     <l n="237">His left young Pallas kept , fixed to his side ,</l>

     <l n="325">Spread every sail , pursue your watery track ,</l>
     <l n="326">And haste your course . Your navy once were we ,</l>
     <l n="327">From Ida 's height descending to the sea ;</l>
     <l n="328">Till Turnus , as at anchor fixed we stood ,</l>
     <l n="329">Presumed to violate our holy wood .</l>
     <l n="330">Then , loosed from shore , we fled his fires profane , }</l>
     <l n="331">( Unwillingly we broke our master 's chain ,) }</l>
     <l n="332">And since have sought you through the Tuscan main . }</l>
     <l n="333">The mighty Mother changed our forms to these ,</l>
     <l n="334">And gave us life immortal in the seas .</l>
     <l n="335">But young Ascanius , in his camp distressed ,</l>
     <l n="336">By your insulting foes is hardly pressed .</l>
     <l n="337">The Arcadian horsemen , and Etrurian host ,</l>
     <l n="338">Advance in order on the Latian coast :</l>
     <l n="339">To cut their way the Daunian chief designs ,</l>
     <l n="340">Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines .</l>
     <l n="341">Thou , when the rosy morn restores the light ,</l>
     <l n="342">First arm thy soldiers for the ensuing fight :</l>
     <l n="343">Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield ,</l>
     <l n="344">And bear aloft the impenetrable shield .</l>
     <l n="345">To-morrow 's sun , unless my skill be vain ,</l>
     <l n="346">Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain . ”</l>
     <l n="347">Parting , she spoke ; and with immortal force</l>
     <l n="348">Pushed on the vessel in her watery course ;</l>
     <l n="349">For well she knew the way . Impelled behind ,</l>
     <l n="350">The ship flew forward , and outstript the wind .</l>
     <l n="351">The rest make up . Unknowing of the cause ,</l>
     <l n="352">The chief admires their speed , and happy omens draws .</l>
     <l n="353">Then thus he prayed , and fixed on heaven his eyes :—</l>
     <l n="354">“ Hear thou , great Mother of the deities ,</l>
     <l n="355">With turrets crowned ! ( on Ida 's holy hill ,</l>
     <l n="356">Fierce tygers , reined and curbed , obey thy will . )</l>
     <l n="357">Firm thy own omens ; lead us on to fight ;</l>
     <l n="358">And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right . ”</l>
     <l n="359">He said no more . And now renewing day</l>
     <l n="360">Had chased the shadows of the night away .</l>
     <l n="361">He charged the soldiers , with preventing care , }</l>
     <l n="362">Their flags to follow , and their arms prepare ; }</l>
     <l n="363">Warned of the ensuing fight , and bade them hope the war . }</l>
     <l n="364">Now , from his lofty poop , he viewed below</l>
     <l n="365">His camp encompassed , and the inclosing foe .</l>
     <l n="366">His blazing shield , embraced , he held on high ;</l>
     <l n="367">The camp receive the sign , and with loud shouts reply .</l>
     <l n="368">Hope arms their courage : from their towers they throw</l>
     <l n="369">Their darts with double force , and drive the foe .</l>
     <l n="370">Thus , at the signal given , the cranes arise</l>
     <l n="371">Before the stormy south , and blacken all the skies .</l>
     <l n="372">King Turnus wondered at the fight renewed ,</l>
     <l n="373">Till , looking back , the Trojan fleet he viewed ,</l>
     <l n="374">The seas with swelling canvas covered o'er ,</l>
     <l n="375">And the swift ships descending on the shore .</l>
     <l n="376">The Latians saw from far , with dazzled eyes ,</l>
     <l n="377">The radiant crest that seemed in flames to rise ,</l>
     <l n="378">And dart diffusive fires around the field ,</l>
     <l n="379">And the keen glittering of the golden shield .</l>
     <l n="380">Thus threatening comets , when by night they rise ,</l>
     <l n="381">Shoot sanguine streams , and sadden all the skies :</l>
     <l n="382">So Sirius , flashing forth sinister lights ,</l>
     <l n="383">Pale human kind with plagues and with dry famine frights .</l>
     <l n="384">Yet Turnus , with undaunted mind , is bent</l>
     <l n="385">To man the shores , and hinder their descent ,</l>
     <l n="386">And thus awakes the courage of his friends :—</l>
     <l n="387">“ What you so long have wished , kind Fortune sends —</l>
     <l n="388">In ardent arms to meet the invading foe :</l>
     <l n="389">You find , and find him at advantage now .</l>
     <l n="390">Yours is the day : you need but only dare ;</l>
     <l n="391">Your swords will make you masters of the war .</l>
     <l n="392">Your sires , your sons , your houses , and your lands ,</l>
     <l n="393">And dearest wives , are all within your hands .</l>
     <l n="394">Be mindful of the race from whence you came ,</l>
     <l n="395">And emulate in arms your fathers ’ fame .</l>
     <l n="396">Now take the time , while staggering yet they stand</l>
     <l n="397">With feet unfirm , and prepossess the strand :</l>
     <l n="398">Fortune befriends the bold . ” No more he said ,</l>
     <l n="399">But balanced , whom to leave , and whom to lead ;</l>
     <l n="400">Then these elects , the landing to prevent ;</l>
     <l n="401">And those he leaves , to keep the city pent .</l>
     <l n="402">Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore :</l>
     <l n="403">Some are by boats exposed , by bridges more .</l>
     <l n="404">With labouring oars they bear along the strand ,</l>
     <l n="405">Where the tide languishes , and leap a-land .</l>
     <l n="406">Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="407">And , where no ford he finds , no water fries ,</l>
     <l n="408">Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar ,</l>
     <l n="409">But smoothly slide along , and swell the shore ,</l>
     <l n="410">That course he steered , and thus he gave command :</l>
     <l n="411">“ Here ply your oars , and at all hazard land :</l>
     <l n="412">Force on the vessel , that her keel may wound</l>
     <l n="413">This hated soil , and furrow hostile ground .</l>
     <l n="414">Let me securely land — I ask no more ;</l>
     <l n="415">Then sink my ships , or shatter on the shore . ”</l>
     <l n="416">This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends :</l>
     <l n="417">They tug at every oar , and every stretcher bends :</l>
     <l n="418">They run their ships aground ; the vessels knock ,</l>
     <l n="419">( Thus forced ashore ,) and tremble with the shock .</l>
     <l n="420">Tarchon 's alone was lost , and stranded stood :</l>
     <l n="421">Stuck on a bank , and beaten by the flood ,</l>
     <l n="422">She breaks her back ; the loosened sides give way ,</l>
     <l n="423">And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea .</l>
     <l n="424">Their broken oars and floating planks withstand }</l>
     <l n="425">Their passage , while they labour to the land , }</l>
     <l n="426">And ebbing tides bear back upon the uncertain sand . }</l>
     <l n="427">Now Turnus leads his troops without delay ,</l>
     <l n="428">Advancing to the margin of the sea .</l>
     <l n="429">The trumpets sound : Æneas first assailed</l>
     <l n="430">The clowns new-raised and raw , and soon prevailed .</l>
     <l n="431">Great Theron fell , an omen of the fight —</l>
     <l n="432">Great Theron , large of limbs , of giant height .</l>
     <l n="433">He first in open fields defied the prince :</l>
     <l n="434">But armour scaled with gold was no defence</l>
     <l n="435">Against the fated sword , which opened wide</l>
     <l n="436">His plated shield , and pierced his naked side .</l>
     <l n="437">Next Lichas fell , who , not like others born ,</l>
     <l n="438">Was from his wretched mother ripped and torn ;</l>
     <l n="439">Sacred , O Phœbus ! from his birth to thee ;</l>
     <l n="440">For his beginning life from biting steel was free .</l>
     <l n="441">Not far from him was Gyas laid along ,</l>
     <l n="442">Of monstrous bulk ; with Cisseus fierce and strong :</l>
     <l n="443">Vain bulk and strength ! for , when the chief assailed ,</l>
     <l n="444">Nor valour nor Herculean arms availed ,</l>
     <l n="445">Nor their famed father , wont in war to go</l>
     <l n="446">With great Alcides , while he toiled below .</l>
     <l n="447">The noisy Pharos next received his death :</l>
     <l n="448">Æneas writhed his dart , and stopped his bawling breath .</l>
     <l n="449">Then wretched Cydon had received his doom ,</l>
     <l n="450">Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom ,</l>
     <l n="451">And sought with lust obscene polluted joys —</l>
     <l n="452">The Trojan sword had cured his love of boys ,</l>
     <l n="453">Had not his seven bold brethren stopped the course</l>
     <l n="454">Of the fierce champion , with united force .</l>
     <l n="455">Seven darts were thrown at once ; and some rebound</l>
     <l n="456">From his bright shield , some on his helmet sound :</l>
     <l n="457">The rest had reached him ; but his mother 's care</l>
     <l n="458">Prevented those , and turned aside in air .</l>
     <l n="459">The prince then called Achates , to supply</l>
     <l n="460">The spears , that knew the way to victory —</l>
     <l n="461">“ Those fatal weapons , which , inured to blood ,</l>
     <l n="462">In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood :</l>
     <l n="463">Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain</l>
     <l n="464">Against our foes , on this contended plain . ”</l>
     <l n="465">He said ; then seized a mighty spear , and threw ;</l>
     <l n="466">Which , winged with fate , through Mæon 's buckler flew ,</l>
     <l n="467">Pierced all the brazen plates , and reached his heart :</l>
     <l n="468">He staggered with intolerable smart .</l>
     <l n="469">Alcanor saw ; and reached , but reached in vain ,</l>
     <l n="470">His helping hand , his brother to sustain .</l>
     <l n="471">A second spear , which kept the former course ,</l>
     <l n="472">From the same hand , and sent with equal force ,</l>
     <l n="473">His right arm pierced , and holding on , bereft</l>
     <l n="474">His use of both , and pinioned down his left .</l>
     <l n="475">Then Numitor from his dead brother drew</l>
     <l n="476">The ill-omen 'd spear , and at the Trojan threw :</l>
     <l n="477">Preventing fate directs the lance awry ,</l>
     <l n="478">Which , glancing , only marked Achates ’ thigh .</l>
     <l n="479">In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came ,</l>
     <l n="480">And , from afar , at Dryops took his aim .</l>
     <l n="481">The spear flew hissing through the middle space ,</l>
     <l n="482">And pierced his throat , directed at his face ;</l>
     <l n="483">It stopped at once the passage of his wind ,</l>
     <l n="484">And the free soul to flitting air resigned :</l>
     <l n="485">His forehead was the first that struck the ground ;</l>
     <l n="486">Life-blood and life rushed mingled through the wound .</l>
     <l n="487">He slew three brothers of the Borean race , }</l>
     <l n="488">And three , whom Ismarus , their native place , }</l>
     <l n="489">Had sent to war , but all the sons of Thrace . }</l>
     <l n="490">Halesus , next , the bold Aurunci leads :</l>
     <l n="491">The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds ,</l>
     <l n="492">Conspicuous on his horse . On either hand ,</l>
     <l n="493">These fight to keep , and those to win , the land .</l>
     <l n="494">With mutual blood the Ausonian soil is dyed ,</l>
     <l n="495">While on its borders each their claim decide .</l>
     <l n="496">As wintery winds , contending in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="497">With equal force of lungs their titles try :</l>
     <l n="498">They rage , they roar ; the doubtful rack of heaven</l>
     <l n="499">Stands without motion , and the tide undriven :</l>
     <l n="500">Each bent to conquer , neither side to yield ,</l>
     <l n="501">They long suspend the fortune of the field .</l>
     <l n="502">Both armies thus perform what courage can ;</l>
     <l n="503">Foot set to foot , and mingled , man to man .</l>
     <l n="504">But , in another part , the Arcadian horse</l>
     <l n="505">With ill success engage the Latin force :</l>
     <l n="506">For , where the impetuous torrent , rushing down ,</l>
     <l n="507">Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown ,</l>
     <l n="508">They left their coursers , and , unused to fight</l>
     <l n="509">On foot , were scattered in a shameful flight .</l>
     <l n="510">Pallas , who , with disdain and grief , had viewed</l>
     <l n="511">His foes pursuing , and his friends pursued ,</l>
     <l n="512">Used threatenings mixed with prayers , his last resource ,</l>
     <l n="513">With these to move their minds , with those to fire their force .</l>
     <l n="514">“ Which way , companions ? whither would you run ?</l>
     <l n="515">By you yourselves , and mighty battles won ,</l>
     <l n="516">By my great sire , by his established name ,</l>
     <l n="517">And early promise of my future fame ;</l>
     <l n="518">By my youth , emulous of equal right</l>
     <l n="519">To share his honours — shun ignoble flight !</l>
     <l n="520">Trust not your feet : your hands must hew your way</l>
     <l n="521">Through yon black body , and that thick array :</l>
     <l n="522">‘ Tis through that forward path that we must come ;</l>
     <l n="523">There lies our way , and that our passage home .</l>
     <l n="524">Nor powers above , nor destinies below , }</l>
     <l n="525">Oppress our arms : with equal strength we go , }</l>
     <l n="526">With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe . }</l>
     <l n="527">See on what foot we stand ! a scanty shore —</l>
     <l n="528">The sea behind , our enemies before ;</l>
     <l n="529">No passage left , unless we swim the main ;</l>
     <l n="530">Or , forcing these , the Trojan trenches gain . ”</l>
     <l n="531">This said , he strode with eager haste along ,</l>
     <l n="532">And bore amidst the thickest of the throng .</l>
     <l n="533">Lagus , the first he met , with fate to foe ,</l>
     <l n="534">Had heaved a stone of mighty weight , to throw :</l>
     <l n="535">Stooping , the spear descended on his chine ,</l>
     <l n="536">Just where the bone distinguished either loin :</l>
     <l n="537">It stuck so fast , so deeply buried lay ,</l>
     <l n="538">That scarce the victor forced the steel away .</l>
     <l n="539">Hisbo came on : but , while he moved too slow</l>
     <l n="540">To wished revenge , the prince prevents his blow ;</l>
     <l n="541">For , warding his at once , at once he pressed ,</l>
     <l n="542">And plunged the fatal weapon in his breast .</l>
     <l n="543">Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust ,</l>
     <l n="544">Who stained his stepdame 's bed with impious lust .</l>
     <l n="545">And , after him , the Daunian twins were slain ,</l>
     <l n="546">Laris and Thymbrus , on the Latian plain ;</l>
     <l n="547">So wondrous like in feature , shape , and size ,</l>
     <l n="548">As caused an error in their parents ’ eyes —</l>
     <l n="549">Grateful mistake ! but soon the sword decides</l>
     <l n="550">The nice distinction , and their fate divides :</l>
     <l n="551">For Thymbrus ’ head was lopped ; and Laris ’ hand ,</l>
     <l n="552">Dismembered , sought its owner on the strand :</l>
     <l n="553">The trembling fingers yet the faulchion strain ,</l>
     <l n="554">And threaten still the extended stroke in vain .</l>
     <l n="555">Now , to renew the charge , the Arcadians came : }</l>
     <l n="556">Sight of such acts , and sense of honest shame , }</l>
     <l n="557">And grief , with anger mixed , their minds inflame . }</l>
     <l n="558">Then , with a casual blow was Rhœteus slain ,</l>
     <l n="559">Who chanced , as Pallas threw , to cross the plain :</l>
     <l n="560">The flying spear was after Ilus sent ;</l>
     <l n="561">But Rhœteus happened on a death unmeant :</l>
     <l n="562">From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled ,</l>
     <l n="563">The lance , athwart his body , laid him dead :</l>
     <l n="564">Rolled from his chariot with a mortal wound ,</l>
     <l n="565">And intercepted fate , he spurned the ground .</l>
     <l n="566">As when , in summer , welcome winds arise ,</l>
     <l n="567">The watchful shepherd to the forest flies ,</l>
     <l n="568">And fires the midmost plants ; contagion spreads ,</l>
     <l n="569">And catching flames infect the neighbouring heads ;</l>
     <l n="570">Around the forest flies the furious blast , }</l>
     <l n="571">And all the leafy nation sinks at last , }</l>
     <l n="572">And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste ; }</l>
     <l n="573">The pastor , pleased with his dire victory ,</l>
     <l n="574">Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky :—</l>
     <l n="575">So Pallas ’ troops their scattered strength unite ,</l>
     <l n="576">And , pouring on their foes , their prince delight .</l>
     <l n="577">Halseus came , fierce with desire of blood ;</l>
     <l n="578">But first collected in his arms he stood :</l>
     <l n="579">Advancing then , he plied the spear so well ,</l>
     <l n="580">Ladon , Demodocus , and Pheres , fell .</l>
     <l n="581">Around his head he tossed his glittering brand ,</l>
     <l n="582">And from Strymonius hewed his better hand ,</l>
     <l n="583">Held up to guard his throat ; then hurled a stone</l>
     <l n="584">At Thoas ’ ample front , and pierced the bone :</l>
     <l n="585">It struck beneath the space of either eye ;</l>
     <l n="586">And blood , and mingled brains , together fly .</l>
     <l n="587">Deep skilled in future fates , Halesus ’ sire</l>
     <l n="588">Did with the youth to lonely groves retire :</l>
     <l n="589">But , when the father 's mortal race was run ,</l>
     <l n="590">Dire destiny laid hold upon the son ,</l>
     <l n="591">And hauled him to the war , to find , beneath</l>
     <l n="592">The Evandrian spear , a memorable death .</l>
     <l n="593">Pallas the encounter seeks , but , ere he throws ,</l>
     <l n="594">To Tuscan Tyber thus addressed his vows :—</l>
     <l n="595">“ O sacred stream ! direct my flying dart ,</l>
     <l n="596">And give to pass the proud Halesus ’ heart :</l>
     <l n="597">His arms and spoils the holy oak shall bear . ”</l>
     <l n="598">Pleased with the bribe , the god received his prayer :</l>
     <l n="599">For , while his shield protects a friend distressed ,</l>
     <l n="600">The dart came driving on , and pierced his breast .</l>
     <l n="601">But Lausus , no small portion of the war ,</l>
     <l n="602">Permits not panic fear to reign too far ,</l>
     <l n="603">Caused by the death of so renowned a knight ;</l>
     <l n="604">But by his own example cheers the fight .</l>
     <l n="605">Fierce Abas first he slew — Abas , the stay</l>
     <l n="606">Of Trojan hopes , and hinderance of the day .</l>
     <l n="607">The Phrygian troops escaped the Greeks in vain :</l>
     <l n="608">They , and their mixed allies , now load the plain .</l>
     <l n="609">To the rude shock of war both armies came ;</l>
     <l n="610">Their leaders equal , and their strength the same .</l>
     <l n="611">The rear so pressed the front , they could not wield</l>
     <l n="612">Their angry weapons , to dispute the field .</l>
     <l n="613">Here Pallas urges on , and Lausus there : }</l>
     <l n="614">Of equal youth and beauty both appear , }</l>
     <l n="615">But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air . }</l>
     <l n="616">Their congress in the field great Jove withstands —</l>
     <l n="617">Both doomed to fall , but fall by greater hands .</l>
     <l n="618">Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief</l>
     <l n="619">Of Lausus ’ danger , urging swift relief .</l>
     <l n="620">With his driven chariot he divides the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="621">And , making to his friends , thus calls aloud :—</l>
     <l n="622">“ Let none presume his needless aid to join ;</l>
     <l n="623">Retire , and clear the field ; the fight is mine :</l>
     <l n="624">To this right hand is Pallas only due ;</l>
     <l n="625">Oh ! were his father here , my just revenge to view ! ”</l>
     <l n="626">From the forbidden space his men retired .</l>
     <l n="627">Pallas their awe , and his stern words , admired ;</l>
     <l n="628">Surveyed him o'er and o'er with wondering sight ,</l>
     <l n="629">Struck with his haughty mien , and towering height .</l>
     <l n="630">Then to the king :— “ Your empty vaunts forbear ;</l>
     <l n="631">Success I hope , and fate I cannot fear .</l>
     <l n="632">Alive , or dead , I shall deserve a name ;</l>
     <l n="633">Jove is impartial , and to both the same . ”</l>
     <l n="634">He said , and to the void advanced his pace :</l>
     <l n="635">Pale horror sat on each Arcadian face .</l>
     <l n="636">Then Turnus , from his chariot leaping light ,</l>
     <l n="637">Addressed himself on foot to single fight .</l>
     <l n="638">And , as a lion — when he spies from far</l>
     <l n="639">A bull that seems to meditate the war ,</l>
     <l n="640">Bending his neck , and spurning back the sand —</l>
     <l n="641">Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand :</l>
     <l n="642">Imagine eager Turnus not more slow ,</l>
     <l n="643">To rush from high on his unequal foe .</l>
     <l n="644">Young Pallas , when he saw the chief advance</l>
     <l n="645">Within due distance of his flying lance ,</l>
     <l n="646">Prepares to charge him first — resolved to try</l>
     <l n="647">If fortune would his want of force supply ;</l>
     <l n="648">And thus to heaven and Hercules addressed :—</l>
     <l n="649">“ Alcides , once on earth Evander 's guest !</l>
     <l n="650">His son adjures thee by those holy rites ,</l>
     <l n="651">That hospitable board , those genial nights ;</l>
     <l n="652">Assist my great attempt to gain this prize ,</l>
     <l n="653">And let proud Turnus view , with dying eyes ,</l>
     <l n="654">His ravished spoils . ” ‘ Twas heard , the vain request ;</l>
     <l n="655">Alcides mourned , and stifled sighs within his breast .</l>
     <l n="656">Then Jove , to sooth his sorrow , thus began :— }</l>
     <l n="657">“ Short bounds of life are set to mortal man . }</l>
     <l n="658">‘ Tis virtue 's work alone to stretch the narrow span . }</l>
     <l n="659">So many sons of gods , in bloody fight</l>
     <l n="660">Around the walls of Troy , have lost the light :</l>
     <l n="661">My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe ;</l>
     <l n="662">Nor I , his mighty sire , could ward the blow .<span corresp="#note10" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></l>
     <l n="663">Even Turnus shortly shall resign his breath</l>
     <l n="664">And stands already on the verge of death . ”</l>
     <l n="665">This said , the god permits the fatal fight ,</l>
     <l n="666">But from the Latian fields averts his sight .</l>
     <l n="667">Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw ,</l>
     <l n="668">And , having thrown , his shining faulchion drew .</l>
     <l n="669">The steel just grazed along the shoulder-joint ,</l>
     <l n="670">And marked it slightly with the glancing point .</l>
     <l n="671">Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew ,</l>
     <l n="672">And poised his pointed spear , before he threw :</l>
     <l n="673">Then , as the winged weapon whizzed along ,</l>
     <l n="674">“ See now , ” said he , “ whose arm is better strung . ”</l>
     <l n="675">The spear kept on the fatal course , unstayed</l>
     <l n="676">By plates of iron , which o'er the shield were laid :</l>
     <l n="677">Through folded brass , and tough bull-hides , it passed ,</l>
     <l n="678">His corslet pierced , and reached his heart at last .</l>
     <l n="679">In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood ;</l>
     <l n="680">The soul comes issuing with the vital blood :</l>
     <l n="681">He falls ; his arms upon his body sound ;</l>
     <l n="682">And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground .</l>
     <l n="683">Turnus bestrode the corpse :— “ Arcadians , hear ,</l>
     <l n="684">Said he ; “ my message to your master bear :</l>
     <l n="685">Such as the sire deserved , the son I send ;</l>
     <l n="686">It costs him dear to be the Phrygian 's friend .</l>
     <l n="687">The lifeless body , tell him , I bestow</l>
     <l n="688">Unasked , to rest his wandering ghost below . ”</l>
     <l n="689">He said , and trampled down , with all the force</l>
     <l n="690">Of his left foot , and spurned the wretched corse ;</l>
     <l n="691">Then snatched the shining belt , with gold inlaid —</l>
     <l n="692">The belt Eurytion 's artful hands had made ,</l>
     <l n="693">Where fifty fatal brides , expressed to sight , }</l>
     <l n="694">All in the compass of one mournful night , }</l>
     <l n="695">Deprived their bridegrooms of returning light . }</l>
     <l n="696">In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore</l>
     <l n="697">Those golden spoils , and in a worse he wore .</l>
     <l n="698">O mortals ! blind in<span corresp="#note11" type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>fate , who never know</l>
     <l n="699">To bear high fortune , or endure the low !</l>
     <l n="700">The time shall come , when Turnus , but in vain ,</l>
     <l n="701">Shall wish untouched the trophies of the slain —</l>
     <l n="702">Shall wish the fatal belt were far away ,</l>
     <l n="703">And curse the dire remembrance of the day .</l>
     <l n="704">The sad Arcadians , from the unhappy field ,</l>
     <l n="705">Bear back the breathless body on a shield .</l>
     <l n="706">O grace and grief of war ! at once restored ,</l>
     <l n="707">With praises , to thy sire , at once deplored .</l>
     <l n="708">One day first sent thee to the fighting field , }</l>
     <l n="709">Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle killed ; }</l>
     <l n="710">One day beheld thee dead , and borne upon thy shield . }</l>
     <l n="711">This dismal news , not from uncertain fame ,</l>
     <l n="712">But sad spectators , to the hero came :</l>
     <l n="713">His friends upon the brink of ruin stand ,</l>
     <l n="714">Unless relieved by his victorious hand .</l>
     <l n="715">He whirls his sword around , without delay ,</l>
     <l n="716">And hews through adverse foes an ample way ,</l>
     <l n="717">To find fierce Turnus , of his conquest proud .</l>
     <l n="718">Evander , Pallas , all that friendship owed</l>
     <l n="719">To large deserts , are present to his eyes —</l>
     <l n="720">His plighted hand , and hospitable ties .</l>
     <l n="721">Four sons of Sulmo , four whom Ufens bred ,</l>
     <l n="722">He took in fight , and living victims led ,</l>
     <l n="723">To please the ghost of Pallas , and expire ,</l>
     <l n="724">In sacrifice , before his funeral fire .</l>
     <l n="725">At Magus next he threw : he stooped below</l>
     <l n="726">The flying spear , and shunned the promised blow ,</l>
     <l n="727">Then , creeping , clasped the hero 's knees , and prayed :</l>
     <l n="728">“ By young Iulus , by thy father 's shade ,</l>
     <l n="729">O ! spare my life , and send me back to see</l>
     <l n="730">My longing sire , and tender progeny .</l>
     <l n="731">A lofty house I have , and wealth untold ,</l>
     <l n="732">In silver ingots , and in bars of gold :</l>
     <l n="733">All these , and sums besides , which see no day ,</l>
     <l n="734">The ransom of this one poor life shall pay .</l>
     <l n="735">If I survive , shall Troy the less prevail ?</l>
     <l n="736">A single soul 's too light to turn the scale . ”</l>
     <l n="737">He said . The hero sternly thus replied :— -</l>
     <l n="738">“ Thy bars and ingots , and the sums beside ,</l>
     <l n="739">Leave for thy children 's lot . Thy Turnus broke</l>
     <l n="740">All rules of war by one relentless stroke ,</l>
     <l n="741">When Pallas fell : so deems , nor deems alone ,</l>
     <l n="742">My father 's shadow , but my living son . ”</l>
     <l n="743">Thus having said , of kind remorse bereft ,</l>
     <l n="744">He seized his helm , and dragged him with his left ;</l>
     <l n="745">Then with his right hand , while his neck he wreathed ,</l>
     <l n="746">Up to the hilts his shining faulchion sheathed .</l>
     <l n="747">Apollo 's priest , Hæmonides , was near ;</l>
     <l n="748">His holy fillets on his front appear ;</l>
     <l n="749">Glittering in arms , he shone amidst the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="750">Much of his god , more of his purple , proud .</l>
     <l n="751">Him the fierce Trojan followed through the field :</l>
     <l n="752">The holy coward fell ; and , forced to yield ,</l>
     <l n="753">The prince stood o'er the priest , and , at one blow ,</l>
     <l n="754">Sent him an offering to the shades below .</l>
     <l n="755">His arms Serestus on his shoulders bears ,</l>
     <l n="756">Designed a trophy to the god of wars .</l>
     <l n="757">Vulcanian Cæculus renews the fight ,</l>
     <l n="758">And Umbro born upon the mountain 's height .</l>
     <l n="759">The champion cheers his troops to encounter those ,</l>
     <l n="760">And seeks revenge himself on other foes .</l>
     <l n="761">At Anxur 's shield he drove ; and , at the blow ,</l>
     <l n="762">Both shield and arm to ground together go .</l>
     <l n="763">Anxur had boasted much of magic charms ,</l>
     <l n="764">And thought he wore impenetrable arms ,</l>
     <l n="765">So made by muttered spells ; and , from the spheres ,</l>
     <l n="766">Had life secured , in vain , for length of years .</l>
     <l n="767">Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod ;</l>
     <l n="768">A nymph his mother , and his sire a god .</l>
     <l n="769">Exulting in bright arms , he braves the prince :</l>
     <l n="770">With his protended lance he makes defence ;</l>
     <l n="771">Bears back his feeble foe ; then , pressing on ,</l>
     <l n="772">Arrests his better hand , and drags him down ;</l>
     <l n="773">Stands o'er the prostrate wretch , and ( as he lay ,</l>
     <l n="774">Vain tales inventing , and prepared to pray )</l>
     <l n="775">Mows off his head : the trunk a moment stood ,</l>
     <l n="776">Then sunk , and rolled along the sand in blood .</l>
     <l n="777">The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain :—</l>
     <l n="778">“ Lie there , proud man , unpitied on the plain ;</l>
     <l n="779">Lie there , inglorious , and without a tomb ,</l>
     <l n="780">Far from thy mother and thy native home ,</l>
     <l n="781">Exposed to savage beasts , and birds of prey ,</l>
     <l n="782">Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea . ”</l>
     <l n="783">On Lucas and Antæus next he ran ,</l>
     <l n="784">Two chiefs of Turnus , and who led his van .</l>
     <l n="785">They fled for fear ; with these , he chased along }</l>
     <l n="786">Camers the yellow-locked , and Numa strong ; }</l>
     <l n="787">Both great in arms , and both were fair and young . }</l>
     <l n="788">Camers was son to Volscens lately slain , }</l>
     <l n="789">In wealth surpassing all the Latian train , }</l>
     <l n="790">And in Amyclæ fixed his silent easy reign . }</l>
     <l n="791">And , as Ægæon , when with heaven he strove ,</l>
     <l n="792">Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove ;</l>
     <l n="793">Moved all his hundred hands , provoked the war ,</l>
     <l n="794">Defied the forky lightning from afar ;</l>
     <l n="795">At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires ,</l>
     <l n="796">And flash for flash returns , and fires for fires ;</l>
     <l n="797">In his right hand as many swords he wields ,</l>
     <l n="798">And takes the thunder on as many shields :</l>
     <l n="799">With strength like his , the Trojan hero stood ; }</l>
     <l n="800">And soon the fields with falling corpse were strowed , }</l>
     <l n="801">When once his faulchion found the taste of blood . }</l>
     <l n="802">With fury scarce to be conceived , he flew</l>
     <l n="803">Against Niphæus , whom four coursers drew .</l>
     <l n="804">They , when they see the fiery chief advance ,</l>
     <l n="805">And pushing at their chests his pointed lance ,</l>
     <l n="806">Wheeled with so swift a motion , mad with fear ,</l>
     <l n="807">They threw their master headlong from the chair .</l>
     <l n="808">They stare , they start , nor stop their course , before</l>
     <l n="809">They bear the bounding chariot to the shore .</l>
     <l n="810">Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains , }</l>
     <l n="811">With two white steeds ; but Liger holds the reins , }</l>
     <l n="812">And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains — }</l>
     <l n="813">Bold brethren both . The former waved in air }</l>
     <l n="814">His flaming sword : Æneas couched his spear , }</l>
     <l n="815">Unused to threats , and more unused to fear . }</l>
     <l n="816">Then Liger thus :— “ Thy confidence is vain</l>
     <l n="817">To ‘ scape from hence , as from the Trojan plain :</l>
     <l n="818">Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode ,</l>
     <l n="819">Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode ;</l>
     <l n="820">Nor Venus ’ veil is here , nor Neptune 's shield ;</l>
     <l n="821">Thy fatal hour is come , and this the field . ”</l>
     <l n="822">Thus Liger vainly vaunts : the Trojan peer</l>
     <l n="823">Returned his answer with his flying spear .</l>
     <l n="824">As Lucagus , to lash his horses , bends ,</l>
     <l n="825">Prone to the wheels , and his left foot protends ,</l>
     <l n="826">Prepared for fight — the fatal dart arrives ,</l>
     <l n="827">And through the border of his buckler drives ;</l>
     <l n="828">Passed through , and pierced his groin . The deadly wound ,</l>
     <l n="829">Cast from his chariot , rolled him on the ground :</l>
     <l n="830">Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite :—</l>
     <l n="831">“ Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight ;</l>
     <l n="832">Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat ;</l>
     <l n="833">But you yourself forsake your empty seat . ”</l>
     <l n="834">He said , and seized at once the loosened rein ;</l>
     <l n="835">For Liger lay already on the plain</l>
     <l n="836">By the same shock ; then , stretching out his hands ,</l>
     <l n="837">The recreant thus his wretched life demands :—</l>
     <l n="838">“ Now , by thyself , O more than mortal man !</l>
     <l n="839">By her and him from whom thy breath began ,</l>
     <l n="840">Who formed thee thus divine , I beg thee , spare</l>
     <l n="841">This forfeit life , and hear thy suppliant 's prayer . ”</l>
     <l n="842">Thus much he spoke , and more he would have said ;</l>
     <l n="843">But the stern hero turned aside his head ,</l>
     <l n="844">And cut him short :— “ I hear another man ;</l>
     <l n="845">You talked not thus before the fight began .</l>
     <l n="846">Now take your turn ; and , as a brother should ,</l>
     <l n="847">Attend your brother to the Stygian flood . ”</l>
     <l n="848">Then through his breast his fatal sword he sent ,</l>
     <l n="849">And the soul issued at the gaping vent .</l>
     <l n="850">As storms the skies , and torrents tear the ground ,</l>
     <l n="851">Thus raged the prince , and scattered deaths around .</l>
     <l n="852">At length Ascanius , and the Trojan train ,</l>
     <l n="853">Broke from the camp , so long besieged in vain .</l>
     <l n="854">Meantime the king of gods and mortal man</l>
     <l n="855">Held conference with his queen , and thus began :—</l>
     <l n="856">“ My sister goddess , and well-pleasing wife ,</l>
     <l n="857">Still think you Venus ’ aid supports the strife —</l>
     <l n="858">Sustains her Trojans — or themselves , alone ,</l>
     <l n="859">With inborn valour force their fortune on ?</l>
     <l n="860">How fierce in fight , with courage undecayed !</l>
     <l n="861">Judge if such warriors want immortal aid . ”</l>
     <l n="862">To whom the goddess with the charming eyes ,</l>
     <l n="863">Soft in her tone , submissively replies :—</l>
     <l n="864">“ Why , O my sovereign lord , whose frown I fear ,</l>
     <l n="865">And cannot , unconcerned , your anger bear —</l>
     <l n="866">Why urge you thus my grief ? when , if I still ,</l>
     <l n="867">( As once I was ,) were mistress of your will ,</l>
     <l n="868">From your almighty power your pleasing wife</l>
     <l n="869">Might gain the grace of lengthening Turnus ’ life ,</l>
     <l n="870">Securely snatch him from the fatal fight ,</l>
     <l n="871">And give him to his aged father 's sight .</l>
     <l n="872">Now let him perish , since you hold it good ,</l>
     <l n="873">And glut the Trojans with his pious blood .</l>
     <l n="874">Yet from our lineage he derives his name ,</l>
     <l n="875">And , in the fourth degree , from god Pilumnus came !</l>
     <l n="876">Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine ,</l>
     <l n="877">And offers daily incense at your shrine . ”</l>
     <l n="878">Then shortly thus the sovereign god replied :—</l>
     <l n="879">“ Since in my power and goodness you confide ,</l>
     <l n="880">If , for a little space , a lengthened span ,</l>
     <l n="881">You beg reprieve for this expiring man ,</l>
     <l n="882">I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence</l>
     <l n="883">From instant fate , and can so far dispense .</l>
     <l n="884">But , if some secret meaning lies beneath ,</l>
     <l n="885">To save the short-lived youth from destined death ,</l>
     <l n="886">Or , if a farther thought you entertain ,</l>
     <l n="887">To change the fates ; you feed your hopes in vain . ”</l>
     <l n="888">To whom the goddess thus , with weeping eyes :—</l>
     <l n="889">“ And what if that request , your tongue denies ,</l>
     <l n="890">Your heart should grant — and not a short reprieve ,</l>
     <l n="891">But length of certain life , to Turnus give ?</l>
     <l n="892">Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth ,</l>
     <l n="893">If my presaging soul divines with truth ;</l>
     <l n="894">Which , O ! I wish , might err through causeless fears ,</l>
     <l n="895">And you ( for you have power ) prolong his years ! ”</l>
     <l n="896">Thus having said , involved in clouds , she flies ,</l>
     <l n="897">And drives a storm before her through the skies .</l>
     <l n="898">Swift she descends , alighting on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="899">Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain .</l>
     <l n="900">Of air condensed , a spectre soon she made ;</l>
     <l n="901">And , what Æneas was , such seemed the shade .</l>
     <l n="902">Adorned with Dardan arms , the phantom bore</l>
     <l n="903">His head aloft ; a plumy crest he wore :</l>
     <l n="904">This hand appeared a shining sword to wield ,</l>
     <l n="905">And that sustained an imitated shield .</l>
     <l n="906">With manly mien he stalked along the ground ,</l>
     <l n="907">Nor wanted voice belied , nor vaunting sound .</l>
     <l n="908">( Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight ,</l>
     <l n="909">Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night . )</l>
     <l n="910">The spectre seems the Daunian chief to dare ,</l>
     <l n="911">And flourishes his empty sword in air .</l>
     <l n="912">At this , advancing , Turnus hurled his spear :</l>
     <l n="913">The phantom wheeled , and seemed to fly for fear .</l>
     <l n="914">Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled ,</l>
     <l n="915">And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed .</l>
     <l n="916">“ Whither , O coward ? ” ( thus he calls aloud ,</l>
     <l n="917">Nor found he spoke to wind , and chased a cloud ,)</l>
     <l n="918">“ Why thus forsake your bride ! Receive from me</l>
     <l n="919">The fated land you sought so long by sea . ”</l>
     <l n="920">He said , and , brandishing at once his blade ,</l>
     <l n="921">With eager pace pursued the flying shade .</l>
     <l n="922">By chance a ship was fastened to the shore ,</l>
     <l n="923">Which from old Clusium king Osinius bore :</l>
     <l n="924">The plank was ready laid for safe ascent ; }</l>
     <l n="925">For shelter there the trembling shadow bent , }</l>
     <l n="926">And skipped and skulked , and under hatches went . }</l>
     <l n="927">Exulting Turnus , with regardless haste ,</l>
     <l n="928">Ascends the plank , and to the galley passed .</l>
     <l n="929">Scarce had he reached the prow ; Saturnia 's hand</l>
     <l n="930">The halsers cuts , and shoots the ship from land .</l>
     <l n="931">With wind in poop , the vessel ploughs the sea ,</l>
     <l n="932">And measures back with speed her former way .</l>
     <l n="933">Meantime Æneas seeks his absent foe ,</l>
     <l n="934">And sends his slaughtered troops to shades below .</l>
     <l n="935">The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud ,</l>
     <l n="936">And flew sublime , and vanished in a cloud .</l>
     <l n="937">Too late young Turnus the delusion found ,</l>
     <l n="938">Far on the sea , still making from the ground .</l>
     <l n="939">Then , thankless for a life redeemed by shame ,</l>
     <l n="940">With sense of honour stung , and forfeit fame ,</l>
     <l n="941">Fearful besides of what in fight had passed ,</l>
     <l n="942">His hands and hagard eyes to heaven he cast :—</l>
     <l n="943">“ O Jove ! ” he cried — “ for what offence have I</l>
     <l n="944">Deserved to bear this endless infamy ?</l>
     <l n="945">Whence am I forced , and whither am I borne ?</l>
     <l n="946">How , and with what reproach , shall I return ?</l>
     <l n="947">Shall ever I behold the Latian plain ,</l>
     <l n="948">Or see Laurentum 's lofty towers again ?</l>
     <l n="949">What will they say of their deserting chief ?</l>
     <l n="950">The war was mine : I fly from their relief !</l>
     <l n="951">I led to slaughter , and in slaughter leave ;</l>
     <l n="952">And even from hence their dying groans receive .</l>
     <l n="953">Here , over-matched in fight , in heaps they lie ,</l>
     <l n="954">There , scattered o'er the fields , ignobly fly .</l>
     <l n="955">Gape wide , O earth , and draw me down alive ! }</l>
     <l n="956">Or , oh ! ye pitying winds , a wretch relieve ! }</l>
     <l n="957">On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive ; }</l>
     <l n="958">Or set me shipwrecked on some desert shore ,</l>
     <l n="959">Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more —</l>
     <l n="960">Unknown to friends , or foes , or conscious fame ,</l>
     <l n="961">Lest she should follow , and my flight proclaim . ”</l>
     <l n="962">Thus Turnus raved , and various fates revolved :</l>
     <l n="963">The choice was doubtful , but the death resolved .</l>
     <l n="964">And now the sword , and now the sea , took place —</l>
     <l n="965">That to revenge , and this to purge disgrace .</l>
     <l n="966">Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main ,</l>
     <l n="967">By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain .</l>
     <l n="968">Thrice he the sword essayed , and thrice the flood ;</l>
     <l n="969">But Juno , moved with pity , both withstood ,</l>
     <l n="970">And thrice repressed his rage ; strong gales supplied ,</l>
     <l n="971">And pushed the vessel o'er the swelling tide .</l>
     <l n="972">At length she lands him on his native shores ,</l>
     <l n="973">And to his father 's longing arms restores .</l>
     <l n="974">Meantime , by Jove 's impulse , Mezentius armed ,</l>
     <l n="975">Succeeding Turnus , with his ardour warmed</l>
     <l n="976">His fainting friends , reproached their shameful flight ,</l>
     <l n="977">Repelled the victors , and renewed the fight .</l>
     <l n="978">Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire ;</l>
     <l n="979">Such is their hate , and such their fierce desire</l>
     <l n="980">Of wished revenge — on him , and him alone ,</l>
     <l n="981">All hands employed , and all their darts are thrown .</l>
     <l n="982">He , like a solid rock by seas inclosed ,</l>
     <l n="983">To raging winds and roaring waves opposed ,</l>
     <l n="984">From his proud summit looking down , disdains</l>
     <l n="985">Their empty menace , and unmoved remains .</l>
     <l n="986">Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead ,</l>
     <l n="987">Then Latagus , and Palmus as he fled .</l>
     <l n="988">At Latagus a weighty stone he flung :</l>
     <l n="989">His face was flatted , and his helmet rung .</l>
     <l n="990">But Palmus from behind receives his wound :</l>
     <l n="991">Hamstringed he falls , and grovels on the ground :</l>
     <l n="992">His crest and armour , from his body torn ,</l>
     <l n="993">Thy shoulders , Lausus , and thy head , adorn .</l>
     <l n="994">Evas and Mimas , both of Troy , he slew .</l>
     <l n="995">Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew —</l>
     <l n="996">Born on that fatal night , when , big with fire ,</l>
     <l n="997">The queen produced young Paris to his sire .</l>
     <l n="998">But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain ,</l>
     <l n="999">Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain .</l>
     <l n="1000">And , as a savage boar , on mountains bred ,</l>
     <l n="1001">With forest mast and fattening marshes fed ,</l>
     <l n="1002">When once he sees himself in toils inclosed ,</l>
     <l n="1003">By huntsmen and their eager hounds opposed ,</l>
     <l n="1004">He whets his tusks , and turns , and dares the war ,</l>
     <l n="1005">The invaders dart their javelins from afar :</l>
     <l n="1006">All keep aloof , and safely shout around ;</l>
     <l n="1007">But none presumes to give a nearer wound :</l>
     <l n="1008">He frets and froths , erects his bristled hide ,</l>
     <l n="1009">And shakes a grove of lances from his side :</l>
     <l n="1010">Not otherwise the troops , with hate inspired ,</l>
     <l n="1011">And just revenge against the tyrant fired ,</l>
     <l n="1012">Their darts with clamour at a distance drive ,</l>
     <l n="1013">And only keep the languished war alive .</l>
     <l n="1014">From Corythus came Acron to the fight ,</l>
     <l n="1015">Who left his spouse betrothed , and unconsummate night .</l>
     <l n="1016">Mezentius sees him through the squadron ride ,</l>
     <l n="1017">Proud of the purple favours of his bride .</l>
     <l n="1018">Then , as a hungry lion , who beholds</l>
     <l n="1019">A gamesome goat , who frisks about the folds ,</l>
     <l n="1020">Or beamy stag , that grazes on the plain —</l>
     <l n="1021">He runs , he roars , he shakes his rising mane ;</l>
     <l n="1022">He grins , and opens wide his greedy jaws :</l>
     <l n="1023">The prey lies panting underneath his paws :</l>
     <l n="1024">He fills his famished maw ; his mouth runs o'er</l>
     <l n="1025">With unchewed morsels , while he churns the gore :</l>
     <l n="1026">So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes ,</l>
     <l n="1027">And first unhappy Acron overthrows :</l>
     <l n="1028">Stretched at his length , he spurns the swarthy ground ;</l>
     <l n="1029">The lance , besmeared with blood , lies broken in the wound .</l>
     <l n="1030">Then with disdain the haughty victor viewed</l>
     <l n="1031">Orodes flying , nor the wretch pursued ,</l>
     <l n="1032">Nor thought the dastard 's back deserved a wound ,</l>
     <l n="1033">But , running , gained the advantage of the ground :</l>
     <l n="1034">Then turning short , he met him face to face ,</l>
     <l n="1035">To give his victory the better grace .</l>
     <l n="1036">Orodes falls , in equal fight oppressed :</l>
     <l n="1037">Mezentius fixed his foot upon his breast ,</l>
     <l n="1038">And rested lance ; and thus aloud he cries :—</l>
     <l n="1039">“ Lo ! here the champion of my rebels lies ! ”</l>
     <l n="1040">The fields around with “ Iö Pæan ! ” ring ;</l>
     <l n="1041">And peals of shouts applaud the conquering king .</l>
     <l n="1042">At this the vanquished , with his dying breath ,</l>
     <l n="1043">Thus faintly spoke , and prophesied in death :—</l>
     <l n="1044">“ Nor thou , proud man , unpunished shalt remain .</l>
     <l n="1045">Like death attends thee on this fatal plain . ”</l>
     <l n="1046">Then , sourly smiling , thus the king replied :—</l>
     <l n="1047">“ For what belongs to me , let Jove provide ;</l>
     <l n="1048">But die thou first , whatever chance ensue . ”</l>
     <l n="1049">He said , and from the wound the weapon drew .</l>
     <l n="1050">A hovering mist came swimming o'er his sight ,</l>
     <l n="1051">And sealed his eyes in everlasting night .</l>
     <l n="1052">By Cædicus , Alcathöus was slain ;</l>
     <l n="1053">Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain ;</l>
     <l n="1054">Orses the strong to greater strength must yield ;</l>
     <l n="1055">He , with Parthenius , were by Rapo killed .</l>
     <l n="1056">Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew ,</l>
     <l n="1057">Who from Lycaon 's blood his lineage drew .</l>
     <l n="1058">But from his headstrong horse his fate he found , }</l>
     <l n="1059">Who threw his master , as he made a bound : }</l>
     <l n="1060">The chief , alighting , stuck him to the ground ; }</l>
     <l n="1061">Then Clonius , hand to hand , on foot assails :</l>
     <l n="1062">The Trojan sinks , and Neptune 's son prevails .</l>
     <l n="1063">Agis the Lycian , stepping forth with pride ,</l>
     <l n="1064">To single fight the boldest foe defied ;</l>
     <l n="1065">Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame ,</l>
     <l n="1066">And not belied his mighty father 's fame .</l>
     <l n="1067">Salius to death the great Authronius sent :</l>
     <l n="1068">But the same fate the victor underwent ,</l>
     <l n="1069">Slain by Nealces ’ hand , well skilled to throw</l>
     <l n="1070">The flying dart , and draw the far-deceiving bow .</l>
     <l n="1071">Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance :</l>
     <l n="1072">By turns they quit their ground , by turns advance ,</l>
     <l n="1073">Victors and vanquished in the various field ,</l>
     <l n="1074">Nor wholly overcome , nor wholly yield .</l>
     <l n="1075">The gods from heaven survey the fatal strife ,</l>
     <l n="1076">And mourn the miseries of human life .</l>
     <l n="1077">Above the rest , two goddesses appear</l>
     <l n="1078">Concerned for each : here Venus , Juno there .</l>
     <l n="1079">Amidst the crowd , infernal Ate shakes</l>
     <l n="1080">Her scourge aloft , and crest of hissing snakes .</l>
     <l n="1081">Once more the proud Mezentius , with disdain ,</l>
     <l n="1082">Brandished his spear , and rushed into the plain ,</l>
     <l n="1083">Where towering in the midmost ranks he stood ,</l>
     <l n="1084">Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood ,</l>
     <l n="1085">( When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves ,</l>
     <l n="1086">His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves ,)</l>
     <l n="1087">Or like a mountain-ash , whose roots are spread ,</l>
     <l n="1088">Deep fixed in earth — in clouds he hides his head .</l>
     <l n="1089">The Trojan prince beheld him from afar ,</l>
     <l n="1090">And dauntless undertook the doubtful war .</l>
     <l n="1091">Collected in his strength , and like a rock</l>
     <l n="1092">Poised on his base , Mezentius stood the shock .</l>
     <l n="1093">He stood , and , measuring first with careful eyes</l>
     <l n="1094">The space his spear could reach , aloud he cries :—</l>
     <l n="1095">“ My strong right hand , and sword , assist my stroke !</l>
     <l n="1096">( Those only gods Mezentius will invoke )</l>
     <l n="1097">His armour , from the Trojan pirate torn ,</l>
     <l n="1098">By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn . ”</l>
     <l n="1099">He said ; and with his utmost force he threw</l>
     <l n="1100">The massy spear , which , hissing as it flew ,</l>
     <l n="1101">Reached the celestial shield : that stopped the course ;</l>
     <l n="1102">But , glancing thence , the yet unbroken force</l>
     <l n="1103">Took a new bent obliquely , and , betwixt</l>
     <l n="1104">The side and bowels , famed Antores fixed .</l>
     <l n="1105">Antores had from Argos travelled far ,</l>
     <l n="1106">Alcides ’ friend , and brother of the war ;</l>
     <l n="1107">Till , tired with toils , fair Italy he chose ,</l>
     <l n="1108">And in Evander 's palace sought repose .</l>
     <l n="1109">Now falling by another 's wound , his eyes</l>
     <l n="1110">He casts to heaven , on Argos thinks , and dies .</l>
     <l n="1111">The pious Trojan then his javelin sent ;</l>
     <l n="1112">The shield gave way ; through triple plates it went</l>
     <l n="1113">Of solid brass , of linen triply rolled ,</l>
     <l n="1114">And three bull-hides which round the buckler rolled .</l>
     <l n="1115">All these it passed , resistless in the course ,</l>
     <l n="1116">Transpierced his thigh , and spent its dying force .</l>
     <l n="1117">The gaping wound gushed out a crimson flood .</l>
     <l n="1118">The Trojan , glad with sight of hostile blood ,</l>
     <l n="1119">His faulchion drew , to closer fight addressed ,</l>
     <l n="1120">And with new force his fainting foe oppressed .</l>
     <l n="1121">His father 's peril Lausus viewed with grief ;</l>
     <l n="1122">He sighed , he wept , he ran to his relief .</l>
     <l n="1123">And here , heroic youth , ‘ tis here I must</l>
     <l n="1124">To thy immortal memory be just ,</l>
     <l n="1125">And sing an act so noble and so new ,</l>
     <l n="1126">Posterity will scarce believe ‘ tis true .</l>
     <l n="1127">Pained with his wound , and useless for the fight ,</l>
     <l n="1128">The father sought to save himself by flight :</l>
     <l n="1129">Encumbered , slow he dragged the spear along ,</l>
     <l n="1130">Which pierced his thigh , and in his buckler hung .</l>
     <l n="1131">The pious youth , resolved on death , below }</l>
     <l n="1132">The lifted sword , springs forth to face the foe ; }</l>
     <l n="1133">Protects his parent , and prevents the blow . }</l>
     <l n="1134">Shouts of applause ran ringing through the field ,</l>
     <l n="1135">To see the son the vanquished father shield .</l>
     <l n="1136">All , fired with generous indignation , strive ,</l>
     <l n="1137">And with a storm of darts , to distance drive</l>
     <l n="1138">The Trojan chief , who , held at bay from far ,</l>
     <l n="1139">On his Vulcanian orb sustained the war .</l>
     <l n="1140">As , when thick hail comes rattling in the wind ,</l>
     <l n="1141">The ploughman , passenger , and labouring hind ,</l>
     <l n="1142">For shelter to the neighbouring covert fly ,</l>
     <l n="1143">Or , housed , or safe in hollow caverns , lie ;</l>
     <l n="1144">But , that o'erblown , when heaven above them smiles ,</l>
     <l n="1145">Return to travail , and renew their toils :</l>
     <l n="1146">Æneas thus , o'erwhelmed on every side , }</l>
     <l n="1147">The storm of darts , undaunted , did abide ; }</l>
     <l n="1148">And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threatening cried :— }</l>
     <l n="1149">“ Why wilt thou rush to certain death , and rage</l>
     <l n="1150">In rash attempts , beyond thy tender age ,</l>
     <l n="1151">Betrayed by pious love ? ” — Nor , thus forborne ,</l>
     <l n="1152">The youth desists , but with insulting scorn</l>
     <l n="1153">Provokes the lingering prince , whose patience , tired ,</l>
     <l n="1154">Gave place ; and all his breast with fury fired .</l>
     <l n="1155">For now the Fates prepared their sharpened shears ;</l>
     <l n="1156">And lifted high the flaming sword appears ,</l>
     <l n="1157">Which , full descending with a frightful sway ,</l>
     <l n="1158">Through shield and corslet forced the impetuous way ,</l>
     <l n="1159">And buried deep in his fair bosom lay .</l>
     <l n="1160">The purple streams through the thin armour strove ,</l>
     <l n="1161">And drenched the embroidered coat his mother wove ;</l>
     <l n="1162">And life at length forsook his heaving heart ,</l>
     <l n="1163">Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart .</l>
     <l n="1164">But when , with blood and paleness all o'erspread ,</l>
     <l n="1165">The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead ,</l>
     <l n="1166">He grieved ; he wept , ( the sight an image brought</l>
     <l n="1167">Of his own filial love , a sadly pleasing thought ,)</l>
     <l n="1168">Then stretched his hand to hold him up , and said :—</l>
     <l n="1169">“ Poor hapless youth ! what praises can be paid</l>
     <l n="1170">To love so great , to such transcendent store</l>
     <l n="1171">Of early worth , and sure presage of more ?</l>
     <l n="1172">Accept whate'er Æneas can afford ;</l>
     <l n="1173">Untouched thy arms , untaken be thy sword ;</l>
     <l n="1174">And all that pleased the living , still remain</l>
     <l n="1175">Inviolate , and sacred to the slain .</l>
     <l n="1176">Thy body on thy parents I bestow , }</l>
     <l n="1177">To rest thy soul , at least , if shadows know , }</l>
     <l n="1178">Or have a sense of human things below . }</l>
     <l n="1179">There to thy fellow-ghosts with glory tell ,</l>
     <l n="1180">‘ Twas by the great Æneas ’ hand I fell . ”</l>
     <l n="1181">With this , his distant friends he beckons near ,</l>
     <l n="1182">Provokes their duty , and prevents their fear :</l>
     <l n="1183">Himself assists to lift him from the ground ,</l>
     <l n="1184">With clotted locks , and blood that welled from out the wound .</l>
     <l n="1185">Meantime , his father , now no father , stood ,</l>
     <l n="1186">And washed his wounds , by Tyber 's yellow flood :</l>
     <l n="1187">Oppressed with anguish , panting , and o'erspent ,</l>
     <l n="1188">His fainting limbs against an oak he leant .</l>
     <l n="1189">A bough his brazen helmet did sustain ;</l>
     <l n="1190">His heavier arms lay scattered on the plain :</l>
     <l n="1191">A chosen train of youth around him stand ;</l>
     <l n="1192">His drooping head was rested on his hand :</l>
     <l n="1193">His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought ;</l>
     <l n="1194">And all on Lausus ran his restless thought .</l>
     <l n="1195">Careful , concerned his danger to prevent ,</l>
     <l n="1196">He much inquired , and many a message sent</l>
     <l n="1197">To warn him from the field — alas ! in vain !</l>
     <l n="1198">Behold , his mournful followers bear him slain !</l>
     <l n="1199">O'er his broad shield still gushed the yawning wound ,</l>
     <l n="1200">And drew a bloody trail along the ground .</l>
     <l n="1201">Far off he heard their cries , far off divined</l>
     <l n="1202">The dire event with a foreboding mind .</l>
     <l n="1203">With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head ; }</l>
     <l n="1204">Then both his lifted hands to heaven he spread ; }</l>
     <l n="1205">Last , the dear corpse embracing , thus he said :— }</l>
     <l n="1206">“ What joys , alas ! could this frail being give ,</l>
     <l n="1207">That I have been so covetous to live ?</l>
     <l n="1208">To see my son , and such a son , resign</l>
     <l n="1209">His life , a ransom for preserving mine ?</l>
     <l n="1210">And am I then preserved , and art thou lost ?</l>
     <l n="1211">How much too dear has that redemption cost !</l>
     <l n="1212">‘ Tis now my bitter banishment I feel :</l>
     <l n="1213">This is a wound too deep for time to heal .</l>
     <l n="1214">My guilt thy growing virtues did defame ;</l>
     <l n="1215">My blackness blotted thy unblemished name .</l>
     <l n="1216">Chased from a throne , abandoned , and exiled</l>
     <l n="1217">For foul misdeeds , were punishments too mild :</l>
     <l n="1218">I owed my people these , and , from their hate ,</l>
     <l n="1219">With less resentment could have borne my fate .</l>
     <l n="1220">And yet I live , and yet sustain the sight</l>
     <l n="1221">Of hated men , and of more hated light —</l>
     <l n="1222">But will not long . ” With that he raised from ground</l>
     <l n="1223">His fainting limbs , that staggered with his wound ;</l>
     <l n="1224">Yet , with a mind resolved , and unappalled</l>
     <l n="1225">With pains or perils , for his courser called —</l>
     <l n="1226">Well-mouthed , well-managed , whom himself did dress }</l>
     <l n="1227">With daily care , and mounted with success — }</l>
     <l n="1228">His aid in arms , his ornament in peace . }</l>
     <l n="1229">Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke ,</l>
     <l n="1230">The steed seemed sensible , while thus he spoke :—</l>
     <l n="1231">O Rh  bus ! we have lived too long for me —</l>
     <l n="1232">If life and long were terms that could agree .</l>
     <l n="1233">This day thou either shalt bring back the head</l>
     <l n="1234">And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead —</l>
     <l n="1235">This day thou either shalt revenge my woe ,</l>
     <l n="1236">For murdered Lausus , on his cruel foe ;</l>
     <l n="1237">Or , if inexorable Fate deny</l>
     <l n="1238">Our conquest , with thy conquered master die :</l>
     <l n="1239">For , after such a lord , I rest secure ,</l>
     <l n="1240">Thou wilt no foreign reins , or Trojan load ,<span corresp="#note12" type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>endure . ”</l>
     <l n="1241">He said ; and straight the officious courser kneels ,</l>
     <l n="1242">To take his wonted weight . His hands he fills</l>
     <l n="1243">With pointed javelins ; on his head he laced</l>
     <l n="1244">His glittering helm , which terribly was graced</l>
     <l n="1245">With waving horse-hair , nodding from afar ;</l>
     <l n="1246">Then spurred his thundering steed amidst the war .</l>
     <l n="1247">Love , anguish , wrath , and grief , to madness wrought ,</l>
     <l n="1248">Despair , and secret shame , and conscious thought</l>
     <l n="1249">Of inborn worth , his labouring soul oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="1250">Rolled in his eyes , and raged within his breast .</l>
     <l n="1251">Then loud he called Æneas thrice by name :</l>
     <l n="1252">The loud repeated voice to glad Æneas came .</l>
     <l n="1253">“ Great Jove , ” he said , “ and the far-shooting god ,</l>
     <l n="1254">Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good ! ”</l>
     <l n="1255">He spoke no more , but hastened , void of fear ,</l>
     <l n="1256">And threatened with his long protended spear .</l>
     <l n="1257">To whom Mezentius thus :— “ Thy vaunts are vain .</l>
     <l n="1258">My Lausus lies extended on the plain :</l>
     <l n="1259">He 's lost ! thy conquest is already won ;</l>
     <l n="1260">The wretched sire is murdered in the son .</l>
     <l n="1261">Nor fate I fear , but all the gods defy . }</l>
     <l n="1262">Forbear thy threats : my business is to die ; }</l>
     <l n="1263">But first receive this parting legacy . ” }</l>
     <l n="1264">He said ; and straight a whirling dart he sent ;</l>
     <l n="1265">Another after , and another , went .</l>
     <l n="1266">Round in a spacious ring he rides the field , }</l>
     <l n="1267">And vainly plies the impenetrable shield . }</l>
     <l n="1268">Thrice rode he round ; and thrice Æneas wheeled , }</l>
     <l n="1269">Turned as he turned : the golden orb withstood</l>
     <l n="1270">The strokes , and bore about an iron wood .</l>
     <l n="1271">Impatient of delay , and weary grown ,</l>
     <l n="1272">Still to defend , and to defend alone ,</l>
     <l n="1273">To wrench the darts which in his buckler light ,</l>
     <l n="1274">Urged , and o'erhYpppHeNlaboured in unequal fight —</l>
     <l n="1275">At length resolved , he throws , with all his force ,</l>
     <l n="1276">Full at the temples of the warrior horse .</l>
     <l n="1277">Just where the stroke was aimed , the unerring spear</l>
     <l n="1278">Made way , and stood transfixed through either ear .</l>
     <l n="1279">Seized with unwonted pain , surprised with fright ,</l>
     <l n="1280">The wounded steed curvets , and , raised upright ,</l>
     <l n="1281">Lights on his feet before ; his hoofs behind</l>
     <l n="1282">Spring up in air aloft , and lash the wind .</l>
     <l n="1283">Down comes the rider headlong from his height :</l>
     <l n="1284">His horse came after with unwieldy weight ,</l>
     <l n="1285">And , floundering forward , pitching on his head ,</l>
     <l n="1286">His lord 's encumbered shoulder overlaid .</l>
     <l n="1287">From either host , the mingled shouts and cries</l>
     <l n="1288">Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies :</l>
     <l n="1289">Æneas , hastening , waved his fatal sword</l>
     <l n="1290">High o'er his head , with this reproachful word :—</l>
     <l n="1291">“ Now ! where are now thy vaunts , the fierce disdain ,</l>
     <l n="1292">Of proud Mezentius , and the lofty strain ? ”</l>
     <l n="1293">Struggling , and wildly staring on the skies</l>
     <l n="1294">With scarce recovered sight , he thus replies :—</l>
     <l n="1295">“ Why these insulting words , this waste of breath ,</l>
     <l n="1296">To souls undaunted , and secure of death ?</l>
     <l n="1297">‘ Tis no dishonour for the brave to die :</l>
     <l n="1298">Nor came I here with hope of victory ;</l>
     <l n="1299">Nor ask I life , nor fought with that design .</l>
     <l n="1300">As I had used my fortune , use thou thine .</l>
     <l n="1301">My dying son contracted no such band :</l>
     <l n="1302">The gift is hateful from his murderer 's hand .</l>
     <l n="1303">For this , this only favour let me sue ,</l>
     <l n="1304">If pity can to conquered foes be due ,</l>
     <l n="1305">Refuse it not ; but let my body have</l>
     <l n="1306">The last retreat of human kind , a grave .</l>
     <l n="1307">Too well I know the insulting people 's hate ;</l>
     <l n="1308">Protect me from their vengeance after fate :</l>
     <l n="1309">This refuge for my poor remains provide , }</l>
     <l n="1310">And lay my much-loved Lausus by my side . ” }</l>
     <l n="1311">He said , and to the sword his throat applied . }</l>
     <l n="1312">The crimson stream distained his arms around ,</l>
     <l n="1313">And the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound .</l>

   <p>These were transformed from ships to sea-nymphs . This is almost as violent a machine , as the death of Arruns by a goddess in the episode of Camilla . But the poet makes use of it with greater art ; for here it carries on the main design . These new-made divinities not only tell Æneas what had passed in his camp during his absence , and what was the present distress of his besieged people , and that his horsemen , whom he had sent by land , were ready to join him at his descent ; but warn him to provide for battle the next day , and foretel him good success : so that this episodical machine is properly a part of the great poem ; for , besides what I have said , they push on his navy with celestial vigour , that it might reach the port more speedily , and take the enemy more unprovided to resist the landing : whereas the machine relating to Camilla is only ornamental ; for it has no effect , which I can find , but to please the reader , who is concerned that her death should be revenged .</p>
   <p>Note II .</p>
   <p>Now , sacred sisters , open all your spring ! The Tuscan leaders , and their army , sing .— P . 71 .</p>
   <p>The poet here begins to tell the names of the Tuscan captains who followed Æneas to the war : and I observe him to be very particular in the description of their persons , and not forgetful of their manners ; exact also in the relation of the numbers which each of them command . I doubt not but , as , in the Fifth Book , he gave us the names of the champions who contended for the several prizes , that he might oblige many of the most ancient Roman families , their descendants — and as , in the Seventh Book , he mustered the auxiliary forces of the Latins on the same account — so here he gratifies his Tuscan friends with the like remembrance of their ancestors , and , above the rest , Mæcenas , his great patron , who , being of a royal family in Etruria , was probably represented under one of the names here mentioned , then known among the Romans , though , at so great a distance , unknown to us . And , for his sake chiefly , as I guess , he makes Æneas ( by whom he always means Augustus ) to seek for aid in the country of Mæcenas , thereby to endear his protector to his emperor , as if there had been a former friendship betwixt their lines . And who knows , but Mæcenas might pretend , that the Cilnian family was derived from Tarchon , the chief commander of the Tuscans ?</p>
   <p>Note III .</p>
   <p>Nor I , his mighty sire , could ward the blow .— P . 83 .</p>
   <p>I have mentioned this passage in my preface to the Æneïs , to prove that fate was superior to the gods , and that Jove could neither defer nor alter its decrees . Sir Robert Howard has since been pleased to send me the concurrent testimony of Ovid : it is in the last book of his Metamorphoses , where Venus complains that her descendant , Julius Cæsar , was in danger of being murdered by Brutus and Cassius , at the head of the commonwealth-faction , and desires [ the gods ] to prevent that barbarous assassination . They are moved to compassion ; they are concerned for Cæsar ; but the poet plainly tells us , that it was not in their power to change destiny . All they could do , was to testify their sorrow for his approaching death , by fore-shewing it with signs and prodigies , as appears by the following lines :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Talia necquidquam toto Venus anxia cælo</l>
     <l n="2">Verba jacit ; superosque movet : qui rumpere quanquam</l>
     <l n="3">Ferrea non possunt veterum decreta sororum ,</l>
     <l n="4">Signa tamen luctús dant haud incerta futuri .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Then she addresses to her father Jupiter , hoping aid from him , because he was thought omnipotent . But he , it seems , could do as little as the rest ; for he answers thus :</p>
   <p>—— sola insuperabile Fatum , Nata , movere paras ? Intres licet ipsa sororum Tecta trium ; cernes illic , molimine vasto , Ex ære et solido rerum tabularia ferro ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Quæ neque concursum cœli , neque fulminis iram ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nec metuunt ullas , tuta atque æterna , ruinas .</l>
     <l n="3">Invenies illic , incisa adamante perenni ,</l>
     <l n="4">Fata tui generis . Legi ipse , animoque notavi ;</l>
     <l n="5">Et referam , ne sis etiamnum ignara futuri .</l>
     <l n="6">Hic sua complevit ( pro quo , Cytherea , laboras )</l>
     <l n="7">Tempora , perfectis , quos terræ debuit , annis , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Jupiter , you see , is only library-keeper , or custos rotulorum , to the Fates : for he offers his daughter a cast of his office , to give her a sight of their decrees , which the inferior gods were not permitted to read without his leave . This agrees with what I have said already in the preface ; that they , not having seen the records , might believe they were his own hand-writing , and consequently at his disposing , either to blot out or alter as he saw convenient . And of this opinion was Juno in those words , tua , qui potes , orsa reflectas . Now the abode of those Destinies being in hell , we cannot wonder why the swearing by Styx was an inviolable oath amongst the gods of heaven , and that Jupiter himself should fear to be accused of forgery by the Fates , if he altered any thing in their decrees ; Chaos , Night , and Erebus , being the most ancient of the deities , and instituting those fundamental laws , by which he was afterwards to govern . Hesiod gives us the genealogy of the gods ; and I think I may safely infer the rest . I will only add , that Homer was more a fatalist than Virgil : for it has been observed , that the word Τυχη , or Fortune , is not to be found in his two poems ; but , instead of it , always Μοιρα .</p>

    <head>ÆNEÏS ,</head>
    <head>BOOK XI .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Æneas erects a trophy of the spoils of Mezentius , grants a truce for burying the dead , and sends home the body of Pallas with great solemnity . Latinus calls a council , to propose offers of peace to Æneas ; which occasions great animosity betwixt Turnus and Drances . In the mean time there is a sharp engagement of the horse ; wherein Camilla signalises herself , is killed ; and the Latine troops are entirely defeated .</head>
     <l n="1">Scarce had the rosy morning raised her head</l>
     <l n="2">Above the waves , and left her watery bed ;</l>
     <l n="3">The pious chief , whom double cares attend</l>
     <l n="4">For his unburied soldiers and his friend ,</l>
     <l n="5">Yet first to heaven performed a victor 's vows :</l>
     <l n="6">He bared an ancient oak of all her boughs ;</l>
     <l n="7">Then on a rising ground the trunk he placed ,</l>
     <l n="8">Which with the spoils of his dead foe he graced .</l>
     <l n="9">The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn ,</l>
     <l n="10">Now on a naked snag in triumph borne ,</l>
     <l n="11">Was hung on high , and glittered from afar ,</l>
     <l n="12">A trophy sacred to the god of war .</l>
     <l n="13">Above his arms , fixed on the leafless wood ,</l>
     <l n="14">Appeared his plumy crest , besmeared with blood :</l>
     <l n="15">His brazen buckler on the left was seen ;</l>
     <l n="16">Trunchions of shivered lances hung between ;</l>
     <l n="17">And on the right was placed his corslet , bored ;</l>
     <l n="18">And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword .</l>
     <l n="19">A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who thus , conspicuous in the midst , began :—</l>
     <l n="21">“ Our toils , my friends , are crowned with sure success ;</l>
     <l n="22">The greater part performed , achieve the less .</l>
     <l n="23">Now follow cheerful to the trembling town ;</l>
     <l n="24">Press but an entrance , and presume it won .</l>
     <l n="25">Fear is no more : For fierce Mezentius lies ,</l>
     <l n="26">As the first fruits of war , a sacrifice .</l>
     <l n="27">Turnus shall fall extended on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="28">And , in this omen , is already slain .</l>
     <l n="29">Prepared in arms , pursue your happy chance ;</l>
     <l n="30">That none unwarned may plead his ignorance ,</l>
     <l n="31">And I , at heaven 's appointed hour , may find</l>
     <l n="32">Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind .</l>
     <l n="33">Meantime the rites and funeral pomps prepare ,</l>
     <l n="34">Due to your dead companions of the war —</l>
     <l n="35">The last respect the living can bestow ,</l>
     <l n="36">To shield their shadows from contempt below .</l>
     <l n="37">That conquered earth be theirs , for which they fought ,</l>
     <l n="38">And which for us with their own blood they bought .</l>
     <l n="39">But first the corpse of our unhappy friend</l>
     <l n="40">To the sad city of Evander send ,</l>
     <l n="41">Who , not inglorious , in his age 's bloom</l>
     <l n="42">Was hurried hence by too severe a doom . ”</l>
     <l n="43">Thus , weeping while he spoke , he took his way ,</l>
     <l n="44">Where , new in death , lamented Pallas lay .</l>
     <l n="45">Acœtes watched the corpse ; whose youth deserved</l>
     <l n="46">The father 's trust ; and now the son he served</l>
     <l n="47">With equal faith , but less suspicious care .</l>
     <l n="48">The attendants of the slain his sorrow share .</l>
     <l n="49">A troop of Trojans mixed with these appear ,</l>
     <l n="50">And mourning matrons with dishevelled hair .</l>
     <l n="51">Soon as the prince appears , they raise a cry ;</l>
     <l n="52">All beat their breasts , and echoes rend the sky .</l>
     <l n="53">They rear his drooping forehead from the ground ;</l>
     <l n="54">But , when Æneas viewed the grisly wound</l>
     <l n="55">Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore ,</l>
     <l n="56">And the fair flesh distained with purple gore ;</l>
     <l n="57">First , melting into tears , the pious man</l>
     <l n="58">Deplored so sad a sight , then thus began :—</l>
     <l n="59">“ Unhappy youth ! when Fortune gave the rest</l>
     <l n="60">Of my full wishes , she refused the best !</l>
     <l n="61">She came ; but brought not thee along , to bless</l>
     <l n="62">My longing eyes , and share in my success :</l>
     <l n="63">She grudged thy safe return , the triumphs due</l>
     <l n="64">To prosperous valour , in the public view .</l>
     <l n="65">Not thus I promised , when thy father lent</l>
     <l n="66">Thy needless succour with a sad consent ;</l>
     <l n="67">Embraced me , parting for the Etrurian land ,</l>
     <l n="68">And sent me to possess a large command .</l>
     <l n="69">He warned , and from his own experience told ,</l>
     <l n="70">Our foes were warlike , disciplined , and bold .</l>
     <l n="71">And now perhaps , in hopes of thy return ,</l>
     <l n="72">Rich odours on his loaded altars burn ,</l>
     <l n="73">While we , with vain officious pomp , prepare</l>
     <l n="74">To send him back his portion of the war ,</l>
     <l n="75">A bloody breathless body , which can owe</l>
     <l n="76">No farther debt , but to the powers below .</l>
     <l n="77">The wretched father , ere his race is run ,</l>
     <l n="78">Shall view the funeral honours of his son !</l>
     <l n="79">These are my triumphs of the Latian war ,</l>
     <l n="80">Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care !</l>
     <l n="81">And yet , unhappy sire , thou shalt not see</l>
     <l n="82">A son , whose death disgraced his ancestry :</l>
     <l n="83">Thou shall not blush , old man , however grieved :</l>
     <l n="84">Thy Pallas no dishonest wound received .</l>
     <l n="85">He died no death to make thee wish , too late ,</l>
     <l n="86">Thou hadst not lived to see his shameful fate .</l>
     <l n="87">But what a champion has the Ausonian coast ,</l>
     <l n="88">And what a friend hast thou , Ascanius , lost ! ”</l>
     <l n="89">Thus having mourned , he gave the word around ,</l>
     <l n="90">To raise the breathless body from the ground ;</l>
     <l n="91">And chose a thousand horse , the flower of all</l>
     <l n="92">His warlike troops , to wait the funeral ,</l>
     <l n="93">To bear him back , and share Evander 's grief —</l>
     <l n="94">A well-becoming , but a weak relief .</l>
     <l n="95">Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier ,</l>
     <l n="96">Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear .</l>
     <l n="97">The body on this rural hearse is borne :</l>
     <l n="98">Strewed leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn .</l>
     <l n="99">All pale he lies , and looks a lovely flower ,</l>
     <l n="100">New cropt by virgin hands , to dress the bower :</l>
     <l n="101">Unfaded yet , but yet unfed below ,</l>
     <l n="102">No more to mother earth or the green stem shall owe .</l>
     <l n="103">Then two fair vests , of wonderous work and cost ,</l>
     <l n="104">Of purple woven , and with gold embossed ,</l>
     <l n="105">For ornament the Trojan hero brought ,</l>
     <l n="106">Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought .</l>
     <l n="107">One vest arrayed the corpse ; and one they spread</l>
     <l n="108">O'er his closed eyes , and wrapped around his head ,</l>
     <l n="109">That , when the yellow hair in flame should fall ,</l>
     <l n="110">The catching fire might burn the golden caul .</l>
     <l n="111">Besides , the spoils of foes in battle slain ,</l>
     <l n="112">When he descended on the Latian plain —</l>
     <l n="113">Arms , trappings , horses — by the hearse are led</l>
     <l n="114">In long array — the achievements of the dead .</l>
     <l n="115">Then , pinioned with their hands behind , appear</l>
     <l n="116">The unhappy captives , marching in the rear ,</l>
     <l n="117">Appointed offerings in the victor 's name ,</l>
     <l n="118">To sprinkle with their blood the funeral flame .</l>
     <l n="119">Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne ;</l>
     <l n="120">Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn ;</l>
     <l n="121">And fair inscriptions fixed , and titles read</l>
     <l n="122">Of Latian leaders conquered by the dead .</l>
     <l n="123">Acœtes on his pupil 's corpse attends ,</l>
     <l n="124">With feeble steps , supported by his friends .</l>
     <l n="125">Pausing at every pace , in sorrow drowned ,</l>
     <l n="126">Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground ;</l>
     <l n="127">Where grovelling while he lies in deep despair ,</l>
     <l n="128">He beats his breast , and rends his hoary hair .</l>
     <l n="129">The champion 's chariot next is seen to roll ,</l>
     <l n="130">Besmeared with hostile blood , and honourably foul .</l>
     <l n="131">To close the pomp , Æthon , the steed of state ,</l>
     <l n="132">Is led , the funerals of his lord to wait .</l>
     <l n="133">Stripped of his trappings , with a sullen pace</l>
     <l n="134">He walks ; and the big tears run rolling down his face .</l>
     <l n="135">The lance of Pallas , and the crimson crest ,</l>
     <l n="136">Are borne behind :— the victor seized the rest .</l>
     <l n="137">The march begins : the trumpets hoarsely sound ;</l>
     <l n="138">The pikes and lances trail along the ground .</l>
     <l n="139">Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse</l>
     <l n="140">To Pallantean towers direct their course ,</l>
     <l n="141">In long procession ranked ; the pious chief</l>
     <l n="142">Stopped in the rear , and gave a vent to grief :—</l>
     <l n="143">“ The public care , ” he said , “ which war attends ,</l>
     <l n="144">Diverts our present woes , at least suspends .</l>
     <l n="145">Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell !</l>
     <l n="146">Hail , holy reliques ! and a last farewell ! ”</l>
     <l n="147">He said no more , but , inly though he mourned ,</l>
     <l n="148">Restrained his tears , and to the camp returned .</l>
     <l n="149">Now suppliants , from Laurentum sent , demand</l>
     <l n="150">A truce , with olive-branches in their hand ;</l>
     <l n="151">Obtest his clemency , and from the plain</l>
     <l n="152">Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain .</l>
     <l n="153">They plead , that none those common rites deny</l>
     <l n="154">To conquered foes , that in fair battle die .</l>
     <l n="155">All cause of hate was ended in their death ;</l>
     <l n="156">Nor could he war with bodies void of breath .</l>
     <l n="157">A king , they hoped , would hear a king 's request ,</l>
     <l n="158">Whose son he once was called , and once his guest .</l>
     <l n="159">Their suit , which was too just to be denied ,</l>
     <l n="160">The hero grants , and farther thus replied :—</l>
     <l n="161">“ O Latian princes ! how severe a fate</l>
     <l n="162">In causeless quarrels has involved your state ,</l>
     <l n="163">And armed against an unoffending man ,</l>
     <l n="164">Who sought your friendship ere the war began !</l>
     <l n="165">You beg a truce , which I would gladly give ,</l>
     <l n="166">Not only for the slain , but those who live .</l>
     <l n="167">I came not hither but by heaven 's command ,</l>
     <l n="168">And sent by fate to share the Latian land .</l>
     <l n="169">Nor wage I wars unjust : your king denied</l>
     <l n="170">My proffered friendship , and my promised bride ;</l>
     <l n="171">Left me for Turnus . Turnus then should try</l>
     <l n="172">His cause in arms , to conquer or to die .</l>
     <l n="173">My right and his are in dispute : the slain</l>
     <l n="174">Fell without fault , our quarrel to maintain .</l>
     <l n="175">In equal arms let us alone contend ;</l>
     <l n="176">And let him vanquish , whom his fates befriend .</l>
     <l n="177">This is the way ( so tell him ) to possess</l>
     <l n="178">The royal virgin , and restore the peace .</l>
     <l n="179">Bear this my message back — with ample leave ,</l>
     <l n="180">That your slain friends may funeral rites receive . ”</l>
     <l n="181">Thus having said — the embassadors , amazed ,</l>
     <l n="182">Stood mute a while , and on each other gazed .</l>
     <l n="183">Drances , their chief , who harboured in his breast</l>
     <l n="184">Long hate to Turnus , as his foe professed ,</l>
     <l n="185">Broke silence first , and to the godlike man ,</l>
     <l n="186">With graceful action bowing , thus began :—</l>
     <l n="187">“ Auspicious prince , in arms a mighty name ,</l>
     <l n="188">But yet whose actions far transcend your fame !</l>
     <l n="189">Would I your justice or your force express ,</l>
     <l n="190">Thought can but equal ; and all words are less .</l>
     <l n="191">Your answer we shall thankfully relate ,</l>
     <l n="192">And favours granted to the Latian state .</l>
     <l n="193">If wished success our labour shall attend ,</l>
     <l n="194">Think peace concluded , and the king your friend :</l>
     <l n="195">Let Turnus leave the realm to your command ,</l>
     <l n="196">And seek alliance in some other land :</l>
     <l n="197">Build you the city which your fates assign ;</l>
     <l n="198">We shall be proud in the great work to join . ”</l>
     <l n="199">Thus Drances ; and his words so well persuade</l>
     <l n="200">The rest empowered , that soon a truce is made .</l>
     <l n="201">Twelve days the term allowed : and , during those ,</l>
     <l n="202">Latians and Trojans , now no longer foes ,</l>
     <l n="203">Mixed in the woods , for funeral piles prepare</l>
     <l n="204">To fell the timber , and forget the war .</l>
     <l n="205">Loud axes through the groaning groves resound ;</l>
     <l n="206">Oak , mountain-ash , and poplar , spread the ground ;</l>
     <l n="207">Firs fall from high ; and some the trunks receive</l>
     <l n="208">In loaden wains ; with wedges some they cleave .</l>
     <l n="209">And now the fatal news by Fame is blown</l>
     <l n="210">Through the short circuit of the Arcadian town ,</l>
     <l n="211">Of Pallas slain —, by Fame , which just before</l>
     <l n="212">His triumphs on distended pinions bore .</l>
     <l n="213">Rushing from out the gate , the people stand ,</l>
     <l n="214">Each with a funeral flambeau in his hand .</l>
     <l n="215">Wildly they stare , distracted with amaze :</l>
     <l n="216">The fields are lightened with a fiery blaze ,</l>
     <l n="217">That casts a sullen splendour on their friends —</l>
     <l n="218">The marching troop which their dead prince attends .</l>
     <l n="219">Both parties meet : they raise a doleful cry ; }</l>
     <l n="220">The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply , }</l>
     <l n="221">And their mixed mourning rends the vaulted sky . }</l>
     <l n="222">The town is filled with tumult and with tears ,</l>
     <l n="223">Till the loud clamours reach Evander 's ears :</l>
     <l n="224">Forgetful of his state , he runs along ,</l>
     <l n="225">With a disordered pace , and cleaves the throng ;</l>
     <l n="226">Falls on the corpse ; and groaning there he lies ,</l>
     <l n="227">With silent grief , that speaks but at his eyes .</l>
     <l n="228">Short sighs and sobs succeed ; till sorrow breaks</l>
     <l n="229">A passage , and at once he weeps and speaks :—</l>
     <l n="230">“ O Pallas ! thou hast failed thy plighted word !</l>
     <l n="231">To fight with caution , not to tempt the sword ,</l>
     <l n="232">I warned thee , but in vain ; for well I knew</l>
     <l n="233">What perils youthful ardour would pursue —</l>
     <l n="234">That boiling blood would carry thee too far ,</l>
     <l n="235">Young as thou wert in dangers , raw to war !</l>
     <l n="236">O curst essay of arms ! disastrous doom !</l>
     <l n="237">Prelude of bloody fields , and fights to come !</l>
     <l n="238">Hard elements of inauspicious war !</l>
     <l n="239">Vain vows to heaven , and unavailing care !</l>
     <l n="240">Thrice happy thou , dear partner of my bed !</l>
     <l n="241">Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled —</l>
     <l n="242">Præscious of ills , and leaving me behind ,</l>
     <l n="243">To drink the dregs of life by fate assigned .</l>
     <l n="244">Beyond the goal of nature I have gone :</l>
     <l n="245">My Pallas late set out , but reached too soon .</l>
     <l n="246">If , for my league against the Ausonian state ,</l>
     <l n="247">Amidst their weapons I had found my fate ,</l>
     <l n="248">( Deserved from them ,) then I had been returned</l>
     <l n="249">A breathless victor , and my son had mourned .</l>
     <l n="250">Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid ,</l>
     <l n="251">Nor grudge the alliance I so gladly made .</l>
     <l n="252">‘ Twas not his fault , my Pallas fell so young ,</l>
     <l n="253">But my own crime for having lived too long .</l>
     <l n="254">Yet , since the gods had destined him to die ,</l>
     <l n="255">At least , he led the way to victory :</l>
     <l n="256">First for his friends he won the fatal shore , }</l>
     <l n="257">And sent whole herds of slaughtered foes before — }</l>
     <l n="258">A death too great , too glorious to deplore . }</l>
     <l n="259">Nor will I add new honours to thy grave ,</l>
     <l n="260">Content with those the Trojan hero gave —</l>
     <l n="261">That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends designed ,</l>
     <l n="262">In which the Tuscan chiefs and army joined .</l>
     <l n="263">Great spoils and trophies , gained by thee , they bear :</l>
     <l n="264">Then let thy own achievements be thy share .</l>
     <l n="265">Even thou , O Turnus , hadst a trophy stood ,</l>
     <l n="266">Whose mighty trunk had better graced the wood ,</l>
     <l n="267">If Pallas had arrived , with equal length</l>
     <l n="268">Of years , to match thy bulk with equal strength .</l>
     <l n="269">But why , unhappy man ! dost thou detain</l>
     <l n="270">These troops , to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain ?</l>
     <l n="271">Go , friends ! this message to your lord relate :</l>
     <l n="272">Tell him , that , if I bear my bitter fate ,</l>
     <l n="273">And , after Pallas ’ death , live lingering on ,</l>
     <l n="274">‘ Tis to behold his vengeance for my son .</l>
     <l n="275">I stay for Turnus , whose devoted head</l>
     <l n="276">Is owing to the living and the dead .</l>
     <l n="277">My son and I expect it from his hand ;</l>
     <l n="278">‘ Tis all that he can give , or we demand .</l>
     <l n="279">Joy is no more ; but I would gladly go ,</l>
     <l n="280">To greet my Pallas with such news below . ”</l>
     <l n="281">The morn had now dispelled the shades of night ,</l>
     <l n="282">Restoring toils , when she restored the light .</l>
     <l n="283">The Trojan king , and Tuscan chief , command</l>
     <l n="284">To raise the piles along the winding strand .</l>
     <l n="285">Their friends convey the dead to funeral fires ; }</l>
     <l n="286">Black smouldering smoke from the green wood expires ; }</l>
     <l n="287">The light of heaven is choked , and the new day retires . }</l>
     <l n="288">Then thrice around the kindled piles they go ;</l>
     <l n="289">( For ancient custom had ordained it so ;)</l>
     <l n="290">Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led ;</l>
     <l n="291">And thrice , with loud laments , they hail the dead .</l>
     <l n="292">Tears , trickling down their breasts , bedew the ground ,</l>
     <l n="293">And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound .</l>
     <l n="294">Amid the blaze , their pious brethren throw</l>
     <l n="295">The spoils , in battle taken from the foe —</l>
     <l n="296">Helms , bitts embossed , and swords of shining steel ;</l>
     <l n="297">One casts a target , one a chariot-wheel ;</l>
     <l n="298">Some to their fellows their own arms restore —</l>
     <l n="299">The faulchions which in luckless fight they bore ,</l>
     <l n="300">Their bucklers pierced , their darts bestowed in vain ,</l>
     <l n="301">And shivered lances gathered from the plain .</l>
     <l n="302">Whole herds of offered bulls , about the fire ,</l>
     <l n="303">And bristled boars , and woolly sheep , expire .</l>
     <l n="304">Around the piles a careful troop attends ,</l>
     <l n="305">To watch the wasting flames , and weep their burning friends —</l>
     <l n="306">Lingering along the shore , till dewy night</l>
     <l n="307">New decks the face of heaven with starry light .</l>
     <l n="308">The conquered Latians , with like pious care ,</l>
     <l n="309">Piles without number for their dead prepare .</l>
     <l n="310">Part , in the places where they fell , are laid ;</l>
     <l n="311">And part are to the neighbouring fields conveyed .</l>
     <l n="312">The corps of kings , and captains of renown ,</l>
     <l n="313">Borne off in state , are buried in the town ;</l>
     <l n="314">The rest , unhonoured , and without a name ,</l>
     <l n="315">Are cast a common heap to feed the flame .</l>
     <l n="316">Trojans and Latians vie with like desires }</l>
     <l n="317">To make the field of battle shine with fires , }</l>
     <l n="318">And the promiscuous blaze to heaven aspires . }</l>
     <l n="319">Now had the morning thrice renewed the light ,</l>
     <l n="320">And thrice dispelled the shadows of the night ,</l>
     <l n="321">When those who round the wasted fires remain ,</l>
     <l n="322">Perform the last sad office to the slain .</l>
     <l n="323">They rake the yet warm ashes from below ;</l>
     <l n="324">These , and the bones unburned , in earth bestow :</l>
     <l n="325">These reliques with their country rites they grace ,</l>
     <l n="326">And raise a mount of turf to mark the place .</l>
     <l n="327">But , in the palace of the king , appears</l>
     <l n="328">A scene more solemn , and a pomp of tears .</l>
     <l n="329">Maids , matrons , widows , mix their common moans ;</l>
     <l n="330">Orphans their sires , and sires lament their sons .</l>
     <l n="331">All in that universal sorrow share ,</l>
     <l n="332">And curse the cause of this unhappy war —</l>
     <l n="333">A broken league , a bride unjustly sought ,</l>
     <l n="334">A crown usurped , which with their blood is bought !</l>
     <l n="335">These are the crimes , with which they load the name</l>
     <l n="336">Of Turnus , and on him alone exclaim :—</l>
     <l n="337">“ Let him , who lords it o'er the Ausonian land ,</l>
     <l n="338">Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand :</l>
     <l n="339">His is the gain ; our lot is but to serve ;</l>
     <l n="340">‘ Tis just , the sway he seeks , he should deserve . ”</l>
     <l n="341">This Drances aggravates ; and adds , with spite ,</l>
     <l n="342">His foe expects , and dares him to the fight .</l>
     <l n="343">Nor Turnus wants a party , to support</l>
     <l n="344">His cause and credit in the Latian court .</l>
     <l n="345">His former acts secure his present fame ,</l>
     <l n="346">And the queen shades him with her mighty name .</l>
     <l n="347">While thus their factious minds with fury burn ,</l>
     <l n="348">The legates from the Ætolian prince return :</l>
     <l n="349">Sad news they bring , that , after all the cost</l>
     <l n="350">And care employed , their embassy is lost ;</l>
     <l n="351">That Diomede refused his aid in war ,</l>
     <l n="352">Unmoved with presents , and as deaf to prayer .</l>
     <l n="353">Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought ,</l>
     <l n="354">Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought .</l>
     <l n="355">Latinus , sunk in sorrow , finds too late ,</l>
     <l n="356">A foreign son is pointed out by fate ;</l>
     <l n="357">And , till Æneas shall Lavinia wed ,</l>
     <l n="358">The wrath of heaven is hovering o'er his head .</l>
     <l n="359">The gods , he saw , espoused the juster side , }</l>
     <l n="360">When late their titles in the field were tried : }</l>
     <l n="361">Witness the fresh laments , and funeral tears undried . }</l>
     <l n="362">Thus full of anxious thought , he summons all</l>
     <l n="363">The Latian senate to the council-hall .</l>
     <l n="364">The princes come , commanded by their head ,</l>
     <l n="365">And crowd the paths that to the palace lead .</l>
     <l n="366">Supreme in power , and reverenced for his years ,</l>
     <l n="367">He takes the throne , and in the midst appears .</l>
     <l n="368">Majestically sad , he sits in state ,</l>
     <l n="369">And bids his envoys their success relate .</l>
     <l n="370">When Venulus began , the murmuring sound</l>
     <l n="371">Was hushed , and sacred silence reigned around .</l>
     <l n="372">“ We have , ” said he , “ performed your high command ,</l>
     <l n="373">And passed with peril a long tract of land :</l>
     <l n="374">We reached the place desired ; with wonder filled ,</l>
     <l n="375">The Grecian tents and rising towers beheld .</l>
     <l n="376">Great Diomede has compassed round with walls</l>
     <l n="377">The city , which Argyripa he calls ,</l>
     <l n="378">From his own Argos named . We touched , with joy ,</l>
     <l n="379">The royal hand that razed unhappy Troy .</l>
     <l n="380">When introduced , our presents first we bring ,</l>
     <l n="381">Then crave an instant audience from the king .</l>
     <l n="382">His leave obtained , our native soil we name ,</l>
     <l n="383">And tell the important cause for which we came .</l>
     <l n="384">Attentively he heard us , while we spoke ;</l>
     <l n="385">Then , with soft accents , and a pleasing look ,</l>
     <l n="386">Made this return :— ‘ Ausonian race , of old</l>
     <l n="387">Renowned for peace , and for an age of gold ,</l>
     <l n="388">What madness has your altered minds possessed ,</l>
     <l n="389">To change for war hereditary rest ,</l>
     <l n="390">Solicit arms unknown , and tempt the sword —</l>
     <l n="391">A needless ill , your ancestors abhorred ?</l>
     <l n="392">We — for myself I speak , and all the name</l>
     <l n="393">Of Grecians , who to Troy 's destruction came —</l>
     <l n="394">( Omitting those who were in battle slain ,</l>
     <l n="395">Or borne by rolling Simoïs to the main ,)</l>
     <l n="396">Not one but suffered , and too dearly bought</l>
     <l n="397">The prize of honour which in arms he sought ;</l>
     <l n="398">Some doomed to death , and some in exile driven ,</l>
     <l n="399">Out-casts , abandoned by the care of heaven —</l>
     <l n="400">So worn , so wretched , so despised a crew ,</l>
     <l n="401">As even old Priam might with pity view .</l>
     <l n="402">Witness the vessels by Minerva tossed</l>
     <l n="403">In storms — the vengeful Capharean coast —</l>
     <l n="404">The Eubœan rocks — the prince , whose brother led</l>
     <l n="405">Our armies to revenge his injured bed ,</l>
     <l n="406">In Egypt lost . Ulysses , with his men ,</l>
     <l n="407">Have seen Charybdis , and the Cyclops ’ den .</l>
     <l n="408">Why should I name Idomeneus , in vain }</l>
     <l n="409">Restored to sceptres , and expelled again ? }</l>
     <l n="410">Or young Achilles , by his rival slain ? }</l>
     <l n="411">Even he , the king of men , the foremost name</l>
     <l n="412">Of all the Greeks , and most renowned by fame ,</l>
     <l n="413">The proud revenger of another 's wife ,</l>
     <l n="414">Yet by his own adulteress lost his life —</l>
     <l n="415">Fell at his threshold ; and the spoils of Troy</l>
     <l n="416">The foul polluters of his bed enjoy .</l>
     <l n="417">The gods have envied me the sweets of life ,</l>
     <l n="418">My much-loved country , and my more loved wife :</l>
     <l n="419">Banished from both , I mourn ; while in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="420">Transformed to birds , my lost companions fly :</l>
     <l n="421">Hovering about the coasts , they make their moan ,</l>
     <l n="422">And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own .</l>
     <l n="423">What squalid spectres , in the dead of night ,</l>
     <l n="424">Break my short sleep , and skim before my sight !</l>
     <l n="425">I might have promised to myself those harms ,</l>
     <l n="426">Mad as I was , when I , with mortal arms ,</l>
     <l n="427">Presumed against immortal powers to move ,</l>
     <l n="428">And violate with wounds the queen of love .</l>
     <l n="429">Such arms this hand shall never more employ .</l>
     <l n="430">No hate remains with me to ruined Troy .</l>
     <l n="431">I war not with its dust ; nor am I glad</l>
     <l n="432">To think of past events , or good or bad .</l>
     <l n="433">Your presents I return : whate'er you bring</l>
     <l n="434">To buy my friendship , send the Trojan king .</l>
     <l n="435">We met in fight : I know him , to my cost :</l>
     <l n="436">With what a whirling force his lance he tossed !</l>
     <l n="437">Heavens ! what a spring was in his arm , to throw !</l>
     <l n="438">How high he held his shield , and rose at every blow !</l>
     <l n="439">Had Troy produced two more his match in might ,</l>
     <l n="440">They would have changed the fortune of the fight :</l>
     <l n="441">The invasion of the Greeks had been returned ,</l>
     <l n="442">Our empire wasted , and our cities burned .</l>
     <l n="443">The long defence the Trojan people made ,</l>
     <l n="444">The war protracted , and the siege delayed ,</l>
     <l n="445">Were due to Hector 's and this hero 's hand :</l>
     <l n="446">Both brave alike , and equal in command ;</l>
     <l n="447">Æneas , not inferior in the field ,</l>
     <l n="448">In pious reverence to the gods excelled .</l>
     <l n="449">Make peace , ye Latians , and avoid with care</l>
     <l n="450">The impending dangers of a fatal war . ’</l>
     <l n="451">He said no more ; but , with this cold excuse ,</l>
     <l n="452">Refused the alliance , and advised a truce . ”</l>
     <l n="453">Thus Venulus concluded his report .</l>
     <l n="454">A jarring murmur filled the factious court :</l>
     <l n="455">As , when a torrent rolls with rapid force ,</l>
     <l n="456">And dashes o'er the stones that stop the course ,</l>
     <l n="457">The flood , constrained within a scanty space ,</l>
     <l n="458">Roars horrible along the uneasy race ;</l>
     <l n="459">White foam in gathering eddies floats around ;</l>
     <l n="460">The rocky shores rebellow to the sound .</l>
     <l n="461">The murmur ceased : then from his lofty throne</l>
     <l n="462">The king invoked the gods , and thus begun :—</l>
     <l n="463">“ I wish , ye Latians , what we now debate</l>
     <l n="464">Had been resolved before it was too late .</l>
     <l n="465">Much better had it been for you and me ,</l>
     <l n="466">Unforced by this our last necessity ,</l>
     <l n="467">To have been earlier wise , than now to call</l>
     <l n="468">A council , when the foe surrounds the wall .</l>
     <l n="469">O citizens ! we wage unequal war ,</l>
     <l n="470">With men , not only heaven 's peculiar care ,</l>
     <l n="471">But heaven 's own race — unconquered in the field ,</l>
     <l n="472">Or , conquered , yet unknowing how to yield .</l>
     <l n="473">What hopes you had in Diomede , lay down :</l>
     <l n="474">Our hopes must centre in ourselves alone .</l>
     <l n="475">Yet those how feeble , and , indeed , how vain ,</l>
     <l n="476">You see too well ; nor need my words explain —</l>
     <l n="477">Vanquished without resource — laid flat by fate —</l>
     <l n="478">Factions within , a foe without the gate !</l>
     <l n="479">Not but I grant that all performed their parts</l>
     <l n="480">With manly force , and with undaunted hearts :</l>
     <l n="481">With our united strength the war we waged ;</l>
     <l n="482">With equal numbers , equal arms , engaged :</l>
     <l n="483">You see the event .— Now hear what I propose ,</l>
     <l n="484">To save our friends , and satisfy our foes .</l>
     <l n="485">A tract of land the Latians have possessed</l>
     <l n="486">Along the Tyber , stretching to the west ,</l>
     <l n="487">Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till ,</l>
     <l n="488">And their mixed cattle graze the fruitful hill .</l>
     <l n="489">Those mountains filled with firs , that lower land ,</l>
     <l n="490">If you consent , the Trojans shall command ,</l>
     <l n="491">Called into part of what is ours ; and there ,</l>
     <l n="492">On terms agreed , the common country share .</l>
     <l n="493">There let them build and settle , if they please ;</l>
     <l n="494">Unless they chuse once more to cross the seas ,</l>
     <l n="495">In search of seats remote from Italy ,</l>
     <l n="496">And from unwelcome inmates set us free .</l>
     <l n="497">Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed ,</l>
     <l n="498">Or twice as many more , if more they need .</l>
     <l n="499">Materials are at hand : a well-grown wood</l>
     <l n="500">Runs equal with the margin of the flood :</l>
     <l n="501">Let them the number and the form assign ;</l>
     <l n="502">The care and cost of all the stores be mine .</l>
     <l n="503">To treat the peace , a hundred senators</l>
     <l n="504">Shall be commissioned hence with ample powers ,</l>
     <l n="505">With olive crowned : the presents they shall bear , }</l>
     <l n="506">A purple robe , a royal ivory chair , }</l>
     <l n="507">And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear , }</l>
     <l n="508">And sums of gold . Among yourselves debate</l>
     <l n="509">This great affair , and save the sinking state . ”</l>
     <l n="510">Then Drances took the word , who grudged , long since ,</l>
     <l n="511">The rising glories of the Daunian prince .</l>
     <l n="512">Factious and rich , bold at the council-board , }</l>
     <l n="513">But cautious in the field , he shunned the sword — }</l>
     <l n="514">A close caballer , and tongue-valiant lord . }</l>
     <l n="515">Noble his mother was , and near the throne ;</l>
     <l n="516">But , what his father 's parentage , unknown .</l>
     <l n="517">He rose , and took the advantage of the times ,</l>
     <l n="518">To load young Turnus with invidious crimes .</l>
     <l n="519">“ Such truths , O king , ” said he , “ your words contain ,</l>
     <l n="520">As strike the sense , and all replies are vain ;</l>
     <l n="521">Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek</l>
     <l n="522">What common needs require , but fear to speak .</l>
     <l n="523">Let him give leave of speech , that haughty man ,</l>
     <l n="524">Whose pride this inauspicious war began ;</l>
     <l n="525">For whose ambition , ( let me dare to say ,</l>
     <l n="526">Fear set apart , though death is in my way ,)</l>
     <l n="527">The plains of Latium run with blood around ;</l>
     <l n="528">So many valiant heroes bite the ground ;</l>
     <l n="529">Dejected grief in every face appears ;</l>
     <l n="530">A town in mourning , and a land in tears ;</l>
     <l n="531">While he , the undoubted author of our harms ,</l>
     <l n="532">The man who menaces the gods with arms ,</l>
     <l n="533">Yet , after all his boasts , forsook the fight ,</l>
     <l n="534">And sought his safety in ignoble flight .</l>
     <l n="535">Now , best of kings , since you propose to send</l>
     <l n="536">Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend ;</l>
     <l n="537">Add yet a greater at our joint request ,</l>
     <l n="538">One which he values more than all the rest :</l>
     <l n="539">Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride ; }</l>
     <l n="540">With that alliance let the league be tied , }</l>
     <l n="541">And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide . }</l>
     <l n="542">Let insolence no longer awe the throne ;</l>
     <l n="543">But , with a father 's right , bestow your own .</l>
     <l n="544">For this maligner of the general good ,</l>
     <l n="545">If still we fear his force , he must be woo 'd ;</l>
     <l n="546">His haughty godhead we with prayers implore ,</l>
     <l n="547">Your sceptre to release , and our just rights restore .</l>
     <l n="548">O cursed cause of all our ills ! must we</l>
     <l n="549">Wage wars unjust , and fall in fight , for thee ?</l>
     <l n="550">What right hast thou to rule the Latian state ,</l>
     <l n="551">And send us out to meet our certain fate ?</l>
     <l n="552">‘ Tis a destructive war : from Turnus ’ hand</l>
     <l n="553">Our peace and public safety we demand .</l>
     <l n="554">Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain ;</l>
     <l n="555">If not , the peace , without the pledge , is vain .</l>
     <l n="556">Turnus , I know you think me not your friend ,</l>
     <l n="557">Nor will I much with your belief contend :</l>
     <l n="558">I beg your greatness not to give the law</l>
     <l n="559">In other realms , but , beaten , to withdraw .</l>
     <l n="560">Pity your own , or pity our estate ;</l>
     <l n="561">Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate .</l>
     <l n="562">Your interest is , the war should never cease ;</l>
     <l n="563">But we have felt enough , to wish the peace —</l>
     <l n="564">A land exhausted to the last remains ,</l>
     <l n="565">Depopulated towns , and driven plains .</l>
     <l n="566">Yet , if desire of fame , and thirst of power ,</l>
     <l n="567">A beauteous princess , with a crown in dower ,</l>
     <l n="568">So fire your mind , in arms assert your right ,</l>
     <l n="569">And meet your foe , who dares you to the fight .</l>
     <l n="570">Mankind , it seems , is made for you alone !</l>
     <l n="571">We , but the slaves who mount you to the throne —</l>
     <l n="572">A base ignoble crowd , without a name ,</l>
     <l n="573">Unwept , unworthy of the funeral flame ,</l>
     <l n="574">By duty bound to forfeit each his life ,</l>
     <l n="575">That Turnus may possess a royal wife !</l>
     <l n="576">Permit not , mighty man , so mean a crew }</l>
     <l n="577">Should share such triumphs , and detain from you }</l>
     <l n="578">The post of honour , your undoubted due . }</l>
     <l n="579">Rather alone your matchless force employ ,</l>
     <l n="580">To merit what alone you must enjoy . ”</l>
     <l n="581">These words , so full of malice mixed with art ,</l>
     <l n="582">Inflamed with rage the youthful hero 's heart .</l>
     <l n="583">Then groaning from the bottom of his breast ,</l>
     <l n="584">He heaved for wind , and thus his wrath expressed :—</l>
     <l n="585">“ You , Drances , never want a stream of words ,</l>
     <l n="586">Then , when the public need requires our swords .</l>
     <l n="587">First in the council-hall to steer the state ,</l>
     <l n="588">And ever foremost in a tongue-debate ,</l>
     <l n="589">While our strong walls secure us from the foe ,</l>
     <l n="590">Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow :</l>
     <l n="591">But let the potent orator declaim ,</l>
     <l n="592">And with the brand of coward blot my name ;</l>
     <l n="593">Free leave is given him , when his fatal hand }</l>
     <l n="594">Has covered with more corps the sanguine strand , }</l>
     <l n="595">And high as mine his towering trophies stand . }</l>
     <l n="596">If any doubt remains , who dares the most ,</l>
     <l n="597">Let us decide it at the Trojans ’ cost ,</l>
     <l n="598">And issue both a-breast , where honour calls —</l>
     <l n="599">( Foes are not far to seek without the walls ,)</l>
     <l n="600">Unless his noisy tongue can only fight ,</l>
     <l n="601">And feet were given him but to speed his flight .</l>
     <l n="602">I beaten from the field ? I forced away ?</l>
     <l n="603">Who , but so known a dastard , dares to say ?</l>
     <l n="604">Had he but even beheld the fight , his eyes</l>
     <l n="605">Had witnessed for me what his tongue denies —</l>
     <l n="606">What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain ,</l>
     <l n="607">And how the bloody Tyber swelled the main .</l>
     <l n="608">All saw , but he , the Arcadian troops retire</l>
     <l n="609">In scattered squadrons , and their prince expire .</l>
     <l n="610">The giant brothers , in their camp , have found ,</l>
     <l n="611">I was not forced with ease to quit my ground .</l>
     <l n="612">Not such the Trojans tried me , when , inclosed ,</l>
     <l n="613">I singly their united arms opposed —</l>
     <l n="614">First forced an entrance through their thick array ,</l>
     <l n="615">Then , glutted with their slaughter , freed my way .</l>
     <l n="616">‘ Tis a destructive war ? So let it be ,</l>
     <l n="617">But to the Phrygian pirate , and to thee !</l>
     <l n="618">Meantime proceed to fill the people 's ears</l>
     <l n="619">With false reports , their minds with panic fears :</l>
     <l n="620">Extol the strength of a twice-conquered race ;</l>
     <l n="621">Our foes encourage , and our friends debase .</l>
     <l n="622">Believe thy fables , and the Trojan town</l>
     <l n="623">Triumphant stands ; the Grecians are o'erthrown ;</l>
     <l n="624">Suppliant at Hector 's feet Achilles lies ,</l>
     <l n="625">And Diomede from fierce Æneas flies !</l>
     <l n="626">Say , rapid Aufidus with awful dread</l>
     <l n="627">Runs backward from the sea , and hides his head ,</l>
     <l n="628">When the great Trojan on his bank appears ;</l>
     <l n="629">For that 's as true as thy dissembled fears</l>
     <l n="630">Of my revenge : dismiss that vanity :</l>
     <l n="631">Thou , Drances , art below a death from me .</l>
     <l n="632">Let that vile soul in that vile body rest ;</l>
     <l n="633">The lodging is well worthy of the guest .</l>
     <l n="634">Now , royal father , to the present state</l>
     <l n="635">Of our affairs , and of this high debate —</l>
     <l n="636">If in your arms thus early you diffide ,</l>
     <l n="637">And think your fortune is already tried ;</l>
     <l n="638">If one defeat has brought us down so low ,</l>
     <l n="639">As never more in fields to meet the foe ;</l>
     <l n="640">Then I conclude for peace : ‘ tis time to treat ,</l>
     <l n="641">And lie like vassals at the victor 's feet .</l>
     <l n="642">But , oh ! if any ancient blood remains ,</l>
     <l n="643">One drop of all our fathers , in our veins ,</l>
     <l n="644">That man would I prefer before the rest ,</l>
     <l n="645">Who dared his death with an undaunted breast ;</l>
     <l n="646">Who comely fell by no dishonest wound ,</l>
     <l n="647">To shun that sight , and , dying , gnawed the ground .</l>
     <l n="648">But , if we still have fresh recruits in store ,</l>
     <l n="649">If our confederates can afford us more ;</l>
     <l n="650">If the contended field we bravely fought ,</l>
     <l n="651">And not a bloodless victory was bought ;</l>
     <l n="652">Their losses equalled ours ; and , for their slain ,</l>
     <l n="653">With equal fires they filled the shining plain ;</l>
     <l n="654">Why thus , unforced , should we so tamely yield ,</l>
     <l n="655">And , ere the trumpet sounds , resign the field ?</l>
     <l n="656">Good unexpected , evils unforeseen ,</l>
     <l n="657">Appear by turns , as fortune shifts the scene .</l>
     <l n="658">Some , raised aloft , come tumbling down amain ;</l>
     <l n="659">Then fall so hard , they bound and rise again .</l>
     <l n="660">If Diomede refuse his aid to lend ,</l>
     <l n="661">The great Messapus yet remains our friend :</l>
     <l n="662">Tolumnius , who foretells events , is ours :</l>
     <l n="663">The Italian chiefs , and princes , join their powers :</l>
     <l n="664">Nor least in number , nor in name the last ,</l>
     <l n="665">Your own brave subjects have our cause embraced .</l>
     <l n="666">Above the rest , the Volscian Amazon</l>
     <l n="667">Contains an army in herself alone ,</l>
     <l n="668">And heads a squadron , terrible to sight ,</l>
     <l n="669">With glittering shields , in brazen armour bright .</l>
     <l n="670">Yet , if the foe a single fight demand ,</l>
     <l n="671">And I alone the public peace withstand ;</l>
     <l n="672">If you consent , he shall not be refused ,</l>
     <l n="673">Nor find a hand to victory unused .</l>
     <l n="674">This new Achilles , let him take the field ,</l>
     <l n="675">With fated armour , and Vulcanian shield !</l>
     <l n="676">For you , my royal father , and my fame ,</l>
     <l n="677">I , Turnus , not the least of all my name ,</l>
     <l n="678">Devote my soul . He calls me hand to hand ;</l>
     <l n="679">And I alone will answer his demand .</l>
     <l n="680">Drances shall rest secure , and neither share</l>
     <l n="681">The danger , nor divide the prize , of war . ”</l>
     <l n="682">While they debate , nor these nor those will yield ,</l>
     <l n="683">Æneas draws his forces to the field ,</l>
     <l n="684">And moves his camp . The scouts with flying speed</l>
     <l n="685">Return , and through the frighted city spread</l>
     <l n="686">The unpleasing news ,— “ The Trojans are descried ,</l>
     <l n="687">In battle marching by the river-side ,</l>
     <l n="688">And bending to the town . ” They take the alarm :</l>
     <l n="689">Some tremble , some are bold ; all in confusion arm .</l>
     <l n="690">The impetuous youth press forward to the field ;</l>
     <l n="691">They clash the sword , and clatter on the shield :</l>
     <l n="692">The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry ; }</l>
     <l n="693">Old feeble men with fainter groans reply ; }</l>
     <l n="694">A jarring sound results , and mingles in the sky , }</l>
     <l n="695">Like that of swans remurmuring to the floods ,</l>
     <l n="696">Or birds of differing kinds in hollow woods .</l>
     <l n="697">Turnus the occasion takes , and cries aloud :—</l>
     <l n="698">“ Talk on , ye quaint haranguers of the crowd :</l>
     <l n="699">Declaim in praise of peace , when danger calls ,</l>
     <l n="700">And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls . ”</l>
     <l n="701">He said , and , turning short with speedy pace ,</l>
     <l n="702">Casts back a scornful glance , and quits the place .—</l>
     <l n="703">“ Thou , Volusus , the Volscian troops command</l>
     <l n="704">To mount ; and lead thyself our Ardean band .</l>
     <l n="705">Messapus , and Catillus , post your force</l>
     <l n="706">Along the fields , to charge the Trojan horse .</l>
     <l n="707">Some guard the passes , others man the wall ;</l>
     <l n="708">Drawn up in arms , the rest attend my call . ”</l>
     <l n="709">They swarm from every quarter of the town ,</l>
     <l n="710">And with disordered haste the rampires crown .</l>
     <l n="711">Good old Latinus , when he saw , too late ,</l>
     <l n="712">The gathering storm just breaking on the state ,</l>
     <l n="713">Dismissed the council till a fitter time ,</l>
     <l n="714">And owned his easy temper as his crime ,</l>
     <l n="715">Who , forced against his reason , had complied</l>
     <l n="716">To break the treaty for the promised bride .</l>
     <l n="717">Some help to sink new trenches ; others aid</l>
     <l n="718">To ram the stones , or raise the palisade .</l>
     <l n="719">Hoarse trumpets sound the alarm ; around the walls</l>
     <l n="720">Runs a distracted crew , whom their last labour calls .</l>
     <l n="721">A sad procession in the streets is seen ,</l>
     <l n="722">Of matrons , that attend the mother queen :</l>
     <l n="723">High in her chair she sits , and , at her side ,</l>
     <l n="724">With downcast eyes appears the fatal bride .</l>
     <l n="725">They mount the cliff , where Pallas ’ temple stands ;</l>
     <l n="726">Prayers in their mouths , and presents in their hands .</l>
     <l n="727">With censers , first they fume the sacred shrine ,</l>
     <l n="728">Then in this common supplication join :—</l>
     <l n="729">“ O patroness of arms ! unspotted maid !</l>
     <l n="730">Propitious hear , and lend thy Latins aid !</l>
     <l n="731">Break short the pirate 's lance ; pronounce his fate ,</l>
     <l n="732">And lay the Phrygian low before the gate . ”</l>
     <l n="733">Now Turnus arms for fight . His back and breast</l>
     <l n="734">Well-tempered steel and scaly brass invest :</l>
     <l n="735">The cuishes , which his brawny thighs infold ,</l>
     <l n="736">Are mingled metal damasked o'er with gold .</l>
     <l n="737">His faithful faulchion sits upon his side ;</l>
     <l n="738">Nor casque , nor crest , his manly features hide :</l>
     <l n="739">But , bare to view , amid surrounding friends ,</l>
     <l n="740">With godlike grace , he from the tower descends .</l>
     <l n="741">Exulting in his strength , he seems to dare</l>
     <l n="742">His absent rival , and to promise war .</l>
     <l n="743">Freed from his keepers , thus , with broken reins ,</l>
     <l n="744">The wanton courser prances o'er the plains ,</l>
     <l n="745">Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds ,</l>
     <l n="746">And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds ,</l>
     <l n="747">Or seeks his watering in the well-known flood ,</l>
     <l n="748">To quench his thirst , and cool his fiery blood :</l>
     <l n="749">He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain ,</l>
     <l n="750">And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane :</l>
     <l n="751">He neighs , he snorts , he bears his head on high ;</l>
     <l n="752">Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly .</l>
     <l n="753">Soon as the prince appears without the gate ,</l>
     <l n="754">The Volscians , and their virgin leader , wait</l>
     <l n="755">His last commands . Then , with a graceful mien ,</l>
     <l n="756">Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen :</l>
     <l n="757">Her squadron imitates , and each descends ;</l>
     <l n="758">Whose common suit Camilla thus commends :—</l>
     <l n="759">“ If sense of honour , if a soul secure</l>
     <l n="760">Of inborn worth , that can all tests endure ,</l>
     <l n="761">Can promise aught , or on itself rely</l>
     <l n="762">Greatly to dare to conquer or to die ;</l>
     <l n="763">Then , I alone , sustained by these , will meet</l>
     <l n="764">The Tyrrhene troops , and promise their defeat .</l>
     <l n="765">Ours be the danger , ours the sole renown :</l>
     <l n="766">You , general , stay behind , and guard the town . ”</l>
     <l n="767">Turnus a while stood mute with glad surprise ,</l>
     <l n="768">And on the fierce virago fixed his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="769">Then thus returned :— “ O grace of Italy !</l>
     <l n="770">With what becoming thanks can I reply ?</l>
     <l n="771">Not only words lie labouring in my breast ,</l>
     <l n="772">But thought itself is by thy praise oppressed .</l>
     <l n="773">Yet rob me not of all ; but let me join</l>
     <l n="774">My toils , my hazard , and my fame , with thine .</l>
     <l n="775">The Trojan , not in stratagem unskilled ,</l>
     <l n="776">Sends his light horse before to scour the field :</l>
     <l n="777">Himself , through steep ascents and thorny brakes ,</l>
     <l n="778">A larger compass to the city takes .</l>
     <l n="779">This news my scouts confirm : and I prepare</l>
     <l n="780">To foil his cunning , and his force to dare ;</l>
     <l n="781">With chosen foot his passage to forelay ,</l>
     <l n="782">And place an ambush in the winding way .</l>
     <l n="783">Thou , with thy Volscians , face the Tuscan horse :</l>
     <l n="784">The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce</l>
     <l n="785">With those of Tibur , and the Latian band ,</l>
     <l n="786">Subjected all to thy supreme command . ”</l>
     <l n="787">This said , he warns Messapus to the war ,</l>
     <l n="788">Then every chief exhorts with equal care .</l>
     <l n="789">All thus encouraged , his own troops he joins ,</l>
     <l n="790">And hastes to prosecute his deep designs .</l>
     <l n="791">Inclosed with hills , a winding valley lies ,</l>
     <l n="792">By nature formed for fraud , and fitted for surprise .</l>
     <l n="793">A narrow track , by human steps untrode ,</l>
     <l n="794">Leads , through perplexing thorns , to this obscure abode .</l>
     <l n="795">High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands ,</l>
     <l n="796">Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands .</l>
     <l n="797">The top is level — an offensive seat</l>
     <l n="798">Of war ; and from the war a safe retreat :</l>
     <l n="799">For , on the right and left , is room to press</l>
     <l n="800">The foes at hand , or from afar distress ;</l>
     <l n="801">To drive them headlong downward ; and to pour ,</l>
     <l n="802">On their descending backs , a stony shower .</l>
     <l n="803">Thither young Turnus took the well-known way ,</l>
     <l n="804">Possessed the pass , and in blind ambush lay .</l>
     <l n="805">Meantime , Latonian Ph  œbe , from the skies ,</l>
     <l n="806">Beheld the approaching war with hateful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="807">And called the light-foot Opis to her aid ,</l>
     <l n="808">Her most beloved and ever-trusty maid ;</l>
     <l n="809">Then with a sigh began :— “ Camilla goes</l>
     <l n="810">To meet her death amidst her fatal foes —</l>
     <l n="811">The nymph I loved of all my mortal train ,</l>
     <l n="812">Invested with Diana 's arms , in vain .</l>
     <l n="813">Nor is my kindness for the virgin new :</l>
     <l n="814">‘ Twas born with her ; and with her years it grew .</l>
     <l n="815">Her father Metabus , when forced away</l>
     <l n="816">From old Privernum for tyrannic sway ,</l>
     <l n="817">Snatched up , and saved from his prevailing foes ,</l>
     <l n="818">This tender babe , companion of his woes .</l>
     <l n="819">Casmilla was her mother ; but he drowned</l>
     <l n="820">One hissing letter in a softer sound ,</l>
     <l n="821">And called Camilla . Through the woods he flies ;</l>
     <l n="822">Wrapped in his robe the royal infant lies .</l>
     <l n="823">His foes in sight , he mends his weary pace ;</l>
     <l n="824">With shouts and clamours they pursue the chase .</l>
     <l n="825">The banks of Amasene at length he gains : }</l>
     <l n="826">The raging flood his farther flight restrains , }</l>
     <l n="827">Raised o'er the borders with unusual rains . }</l>
     <l n="828">Prepared to plunge into the stream , he fears ,</l>
     <l n="829">Not for himself , but for the charge he bears .</l>
     <l n="830">Anxious , he stops a while , and thinks in haste ,</l>
     <l n="831">Then , desperate in distress , resolves at last .</l>
     <l n="832">A knotty lance of well-boiled oak he bore ;</l>
     <l n="833">The middle part with cork he covered o'er :</l>
     <l n="834">He closed the child within the hollow space ;</l>
     <l n="835">With twigs of bending osier bound the case ,</l>
     <l n="836">Then poised the spear , heavy with human weight ,</l>
     <l n="837">And thus invoked my favour for the freight :—</l>
     <l n="838">‘ Accept , great goddess of the woods , ( he said ,)</l>
     <l n="839">Sent by her sire , this dedicated maid !</l>
     <l n="840">Through air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine ;</l>
     <l n="841">And the first weapons that she knows , are thine . ’</l>
     <l n="842">He said ; and with full force the spear he threw :</l>
     <l n="843">Above the sounding waves Camilla flew .</l>
     <l n="844">Then , pressed by foes , he stemmed the stormy tide ,</l>
     <l n="845">And gained , by stress of arms , the farther side .</l>
     <l n="846">His fastened spear he pulled from out the ground ,</l>
     <l n="847">And , victor of his vows , his infant nymph unbound ;</l>
     <l n="848">Nor , after that , in towns which walls inclose ,</l>
     <l n="849">Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes ;</l>
     <l n="850">But , rough , in open air he chose to lie ;</l>
     <l n="851">Earth was his couch , his covering was the sky .</l>
     <l n="852">On hills unshorn , or in a desert den ,</l>
     <l n="853">He shunned the dire society of men .</l>
     <l n="854">A shepherd 's solitary life he led ;</l>
     <l n="855">His daughter with the milk of mares he fed .</l>
     <l n="856">The dugs of bears , and every savage beast ,</l>
     <l n="857">He drew , and through her lips the liquor pressed .</l>
     <l n="858">The little Amazon could scarcely go —</l>
     <l n="859">He loads her with a quiver and a bow ;</l>
     <l n="860">And , that she might her staggering steps command ,</l>
     <l n="861">He with a slender javelin fills her hand .</l>
     <l n="862">Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound ;</l>
     <l n="863">Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground .</l>
     <l n="864">Instead of these , a tyger 's hide o'erspread</l>
     <l n="865">Her back and shoulders , fastened to her head .</l>
     <l n="866">The flying dart she first attempts to fling ,</l>
     <l n="867">And round her tender temples tossed the sling ;</l>
     <l n="868">Then , as her strength with years increased , began }</l>
     <l n="869">To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan , }</l>
     <l n="870">And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane . }</l>
     <l n="871">The Tuscan matrons with each other vied ,</l>
     <l n="872">To bless their rival sons with such a bride :</l>
     <l n="873">But she disdains their love , to share with me</l>
     <l n="874">The sylvan shades , and vowed virginity .</l>
     <l n="875">And , oh ! I wish , contented with my cares</l>
     <l n="876">Of savage spoils , she had not sought the wars :</l>
     <l n="877">Then had she been of my celestial train ,</l>
     <l n="878">And shunned the fate that dooms her to be slain .</l>
     <l n="879">But since , opposing heaven 's decree , she goes</l>
     <l n="880">To find her death among forbidden foes ,</l>
     <l n="881">Haste with these arms , and take thy steepy flight ,</l>
     <l n="882">Where , with the gods adverse , the Latins fight .</l>
     <l n="883">This bow to thee , this quiver , I bequeath ,</l>
     <l n="884">This chosen arrow , to revenge her death :</l>
     <l n="885">By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain , }</l>
     <l n="886">Or of the Trojan or Italian train , }</l>
     <l n="887">Let him not pass unpunished from the plain . }</l>
     <l n="888">Then , in a hollow cloud , myself will aid</l>
     <l n="889">To bear the breathless body of my maid :</l>
     <l n="890">Unspoiled shall be her arms , and unprofaned }</l>
     <l n="891">Her holy limbs with any human hand , }</l>
     <l n="892">And in a marble tomb laid in her native land . ” }</l>
     <l n="893">She said . The faithful nymph descends from high }</l>
     <l n="894">With rapid flight , and cuts the sounding sky : }</l>
     <l n="895">Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly . }</l>
     <l n="896">By this , the Trojan and the Tuscan horse ,</l>
     <l n="897">Drawn up in squadrons , with united force</l>
     <l n="898">Approach the walls : the sprightly coursers bound ,</l>
     <l n="899">Press forward on their bits , and shift their ground .</l>
     <l n="900">Shields , arms , and spears , flash horribly from far ;</l>
     <l n="901">And the fields glitter with a waving war .</l>
     <l n="902">Opposed to these , come on with furious force</l>
     <l n="903">Messapus , Coras , and the Latian horse ;</l>
     <l n="904">These in the body placed , on either hand</l>
     <l n="905">Sustained and closed by fair Camilla 's band .</l>
     <l n="906">Advancing in a line , they couch their spears ;</l>
     <l n="907">And less and less the middle space appears .</l>
     <l n="908">Thick smoke obscures the field ; and scarce are seen</l>
     <l n="909">The neighing coursers , and the shouting men .</l>
     <l n="910">In distance of their darts they stop their course ;</l>
     <l n="911">Then man to man they rush , and horse to horse .</l>
     <l n="912">The face of heaven their flying javelins hide ,</l>
     <l n="913">And deaths unseen are dealt on either side .</l>
     <l n="914">Tyrrhenus , and Aconteus void of fear ,</l>
     <l n="915">By mettled coursers borne in full career ,</l>
     <l n="916">Meet first opposed ; and , with a mighty shock ,</l>
     <l n="917">Their horses ’ heads against each other knock .</l>
     <l n="918">Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast , }</l>
     <l n="919">As with an engine 's force , or lightning 's blast : }</l>
     <l n="920">He rolls along in blood , and breathes his last . }</l>
     <l n="921">The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright ,</l>
     <l n="922">And sling their shields behind , to save their backs in flight .</l>
     <l n="923">Spurring at speed , to their own walls they drew ;</l>
     <l n="924">Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue ,</l>
     <l n="925">And urge their flight : Asylas leads the chase ;</l>
     <l n="926">Till , seized with shame , they wheel about , and face ,</l>
     <l n="927">Receive their foes , and raise a threatening cry .</l>
     <l n="928">The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly .</l>
     <l n="929">So swelling surges , with a thundering roar ,</l>
     <l n="930">Driven on each other 's backs , insult the shore ,</l>
     <l n="931">Bound o'er the rocks , encroach upon the land ,</l>
     <l n="932">And far upon the beach eject the sand ;</l>
     <l n="933">Then backward , with a swing , they take their way ,</l>
     <l n="934">Repulsed from upper ground , and seek their mother sea ;</l>
     <l n="935">With equal hurry quit the invaded shore ,</l>
     <l n="936">And swallow back the sand and stones they spewed before .</l>
     <l n="937">Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field ,</l>
     <l n="938">Twice by the Latins , in their turn , repelled .</l>
     <l n="939">Ashamed at length , to the third charge they ran —</l>
     <l n="940">Both hosts resolved , and mingled man to man .</l>
     <l n="941">Now dying groans are heard ; the fields are strowed</l>
     <l n="942">With falling bodies , and are drunk with blood .</l>
     <l n="943">Arms , horses , men , on heaps together lie :</l>
     <l n="944">Confused the fight , and more confused the cry .</l>
     <l n="945">Orsilochus , who durst not press too near }</l>
     <l n="946">Strong Remulus , at distance drove his spear , }</l>
     <l n="947">And struck the steel beneath his horse 's ear . }</l>
     <l n="948">The fiery steed , impatient of the wound , }</l>
     <l n="949">Curvets , and , springing upward with a bound , }</l>
     <l n="950">His helpless lord cast backward on the ground . }</l>
     <l n="951">Catillus pierced Iolas first ; then drew }</l>
     <l n="952">His reeking lance , and at Herminius threw , }</l>
     <l n="953">The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew . }</l>
     <l n="954">His neck and throat unarmed , his head was bare ,</l>
     <l n="955">But shaded with a length of yellow hair :</l>
     <l n="956">Secure , he fought , exposed on every part ,</l>
     <l n="957">A spacious mark for swords , and for the flying dart .</l>
     <l n="958">Across the shoulders came the feathered wound ;</l>
     <l n="959">Transfixed , he fell , and doubled to the ground .</l>
     <l n="960">The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed ,</l>
     <l n="961">And death , with honour , sought on either side .</l>
     <l n="962">Resistless , through the war Camilla rode ,</l>
     <l n="963">In danger unappalled , and pleased with blood .</l>
     <l n="964">One side was bare for her exerted breast ;</l>
     <l n="965">One shoulder with her painted quiver pressed .</l>
     <l n="966">Now from afar her fatal javelins play ;</l>
     <l n="967">Now with her axe 's edge she hews her way :</l>
     <l n="968">Diana 's arms upon her shoulder sound ; }</l>
     <l n="969">And when , too closely pressed , she quits the ground , }</l>
     <l n="970">From her bent bow she sends a backward wound . }</l>
     <l n="971">Her maids , in martial pomp , on either side ,</l>
     <l n="972">Larina , Tulla , fierce Tarpeia , ride —</l>
     <l n="973">Italians all — in peace , their queen 's delight ;</l>
     <l n="974">In war , the bold companions of the fight .</l>
     <l n="975">So marched the Thracian Amazons of old ,</l>
     <l n="976">When Thermodon with bloody billows rolled :</l>
     <l n="977">Such troops as these in shining arms were seen ,</l>
     <l n="978">When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen :</l>
     <l n="979">Such to the field Penthesilea led ,</l>
     <l n="980">From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled ;</l>
     <l n="981">With such returned triumphant from the war ,</l>
     <l n="982">Her maids with cries attend the lofty car ;</l>
     <l n="983">They clash with manly force their moony shields ;</l>
     <l n="984">With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields .</l>
     <l n="985">Who foremost , and who last , heroic maid ,</l>
     <l n="986">On the cold earth were by thy courage laid ?</l>
     <l n="987">Thy spear , of mountain-ash , Eunæus first ,</l>
     <l n="988">With fury driven , from side to side transpierced :</l>
     <l n="989">A purple stream came spouting from the wound ;</l>
     <l n="990">Bathed in his blood he lies , and bites the ground .</l>
     <l n="991">Liris and Pagasus at once she slew :</l>
     <l n="992">The former , as the slackened reins he drew ,</l>
     <l n="993">Of his faint steed — the latter , as he stretched</l>
     <l n="994">His arm to prop his friend — the javelin reached .</l>
     <l n="995">By the same weapon , sent from the same hand ,</l>
     <l n="996">Both fall together , and both spurn the sand .</l>
     <l n="997">Amastrus next is added to the slain :</l>
     <l n="998">The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain :</l>
     <l n="999">Tereus , Harpalycus , Demophoon ,</l>
     <l n="1000">And Chromis , at full speed her fury shun .</l>
     <l n="1001">Of all her deadly darts , not one she lost ;</l>
     <l n="1002">Each was attended with a Trojan ghost .</l>
     <l n="1003">Young Ornytus bestrode a hunter steed ,</l>
     <l n="1004">Swift for the chase , and of Apulian breed .</l>
     <l n="1005">Him , from afar , she spied , in arms unknown :</l>
     <l n="1006">O'er his broad back an ox 's hide was thrown ;</l>
     <l n="1007">His helm a wolf , whose gaping jaws were spread</l>
     <l n="1008">A covering for his cheeks , and grinned around his head .</l>
     <l n="1009">He clenched within his hand an iron prong ,</l>
     <l n="1010">And towered above the rest , conspicuous in the throng .</l>
     <l n="1011">Him soon she singled from the flying train ,</l>
     <l n="1012">And slew with ease ; then thus insults the slain :—</l>
     <l n="1013">“ Vain hunter ! didst thou think through woods to chase</l>
     <l n="1014">The savage herd , a vile and trembling race ?</l>
     <l n="1015">Here cease thy vaunts , and own my victory :</l>
     <l n="1016">A woman warrior was too strong for thee .</l>
     <l n="1017">Yet , if the ghosts demand the conqueror 's name ,</l>
     <l n="1018">Confessing great Camilla , save thy shame . ”</l>
     <l n="1019">Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew ,</l>
     <l n="1020">The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew —</l>
     <l n="1021">But Butes breast to breast : the spear descends }</l>
     <l n="1022">Above the gorget , where his helmet ends , }</l>
     <l n="1023">And o'er the shield which his left side defends . }</l>
     <l n="1024">Orsilochus , and she , their coursers ply :</l>
     <l n="1025">He seems to follow , and she seems to fly .</l>
     <l n="1026">But in a narrower ring she makes the race ;</l>
     <l n="1027">And then he flies , and she pursues the chase .</l>
     <l n="1028">Gathering at length on her deluded foe ,</l>
     <l n="1029">She swings her axe , and rises to the blow ;</l>
     <l n="1030">Full on the helm behind , with such a sway</l>
     <l n="1031">The weapon falls , the riven steel gives way :</l>
     <l n="1032">He groans , he roars , he sues in vain for grace ;</l>
     <l n="1033">Brains , mingled with his blood , besmear his face .</l>
     <l n="1034">Astonished Aunus just arrives by chance ,</l>
     <l n="1035">To see his fall , nor farther dares advance ;</l>
     <l n="1036">But , fixing on the horrid maid his eye ,</l>
     <l n="1037">He stares , and shakes , and finds it vain to fly ;</l>
     <l n="1038">Yet , like a true Ligurian , born to cheat ,</l>
     <l n="1039">( At least while Fortune favoured his deceit ,)</l>
     <l n="1040">Cries out aloud ,— “ What courage have you shown ,</l>
     <l n="1041">Who trust your courser 's strength , and not your own ?</l>
     <l n="1042">Forego the ‘ vantage of your horse , alight ,</l>
     <l n="1043">And then on equal terms begin the fight :</l>
     <l n="1044">It shall be seen , weak woman , what you can ,</l>
     <l n="1045">When , foot to foot , you combat with a man . ”</l>
     <l n="1046">He said . She glows with anger and disdain , }</l>
     <l n="1047">Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain , }</l>
     <l n="1048">And leaves her horse at large among her train ; }</l>
     <l n="1049">With her drawn sword defies him to the field ,</l>
     <l n="1050">And , marching , lifts aloft her maiden shield .</l>
     <l n="1051">The youth , who thought his cunning did succeed ,</l>
     <l n="1052">Reins round his horse , and urges all his speed ,</l>
     <l n="1053">Adds the remembrance of the spur , and hides</l>
     <l n="1054">The goring rowels in his bleeding sides .</l>
     <l n="1055">“ Vain fool , and coward ! ” said the lofty maid ,</l>
     <l n="1056">“ Caught in the train , which thou thyself hast laid !</l>
     <l n="1057">On others practise thy Ligurian arts ;</l>
     <l n="1058">Thin stratagems , and tricks of little hearts ,</l>
     <l n="1059">Are lost on me : nor shalt thou safe retire ,</l>
     <l n="1060">With vaunting lies , to thy fallacious sire . ”</l>
     <l n="1061">At this , so fast her flying feet she sped ,</l>
     <l n="1062">That soon she strained beyond his horse 's head :</l>
     <l n="1063">Then turning short , at once she seized the rein ,</l>
     <l n="1064">And laid the boaster grovelling on the plain .</l>
     <l n="1065">Not with more ease the falcon , from above ,</l>
     <l n="1066">Trusses , in middle air , the trembling dove ,</l>
     <l n="1067">Then plumes the prey , in her strong pounces bound :</l>
     <l n="1068">The feathers , foul with blood , come tumbling to the ground .</l>
     <l n="1069">Now mighty Jove , from his superior height ,</l>
     <l n="1070">With his broad eye surveys the unequal fight .</l>
     <l n="1071">He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain ,</l>
     <l n="1072">And sends him to redeem the abandoned plain .</l>
     <l n="1073">Between the broken ranks the Tuscan rides ,</l>
     <l n="1074">And these encourages , and those he chides ;</l>
     <l n="1075">Recals each leader , by his name , from flight ;</l>
     <l n="1076">Renews their ardour , and restores the fight .</l>
     <l n="1077">“ What panic fear has seized your souls ? O shame ,</l>
     <l n="1078">O brand perpetual of the Etrurian name !</l>
     <l n="1079">Cowards incurable ! a woman 's hand</l>
     <l n="1080">Drives , breaks , and scatters , your ignoble band !</l>
     <l n="1081">Now cast away the sword , and quit the shield !</l>
     <l n="1082">What use of weapons which you dare not wield ?</l>
     <l n="1083">Not thus you fly your female foes by night ,</l>
     <l n="1084">Nor shun the feast , when the full bowls invite ;</l>
     <l n="1085">When to fat offerings the glad augur calls ,</l>
     <l n="1086">And the shrill horn-pipe sounds to bacchanals .</l>
     <l n="1087">These are your studied cares , your lewd delight —</l>
     <l n="1088">Swift to debauch , but slow to manly fight . ”</l>
     <l n="1089">Thus having said , he spurs amid the foes ,</l>
     <l n="1090">Not managing the life he meant to lose .</l>
     <l n="1091">The first he found he seized , with headlong haste ,</l>
     <l n="1092">In his strong gripe , and clasped around the waist :</l>
     <l n="1093">‘ Twas Venulus , whom from his horse he tore ,</l>
     <l n="1094">And ( laid athwart his own ) in triumph bore .</l>
     <l n="1095">Loud shouts ensue ; the Latins turn their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1096">And view the unusual sight with vast surprise .</l>
     <l n="1097">The fiery Tarchon , flying o'er the plains ,</l>
     <l n="1098">Pressed in his arms the ponderous prey sustains ,</l>
     <l n="1099">Then , with his shortened spear , explores around</l>
     <l n="1100">His jointed arms , to fix a deadly wound .</l>
     <l n="1101">Nor less the captive struggles for his life :</l>
     <l n="1102">He writhes his body to prolong the strife ,</l>
     <l n="1103">And , fencing for his naked throat , exerts</l>
     <l n="1104">His utmost vigour , and the point averts .</l>
     <l n="1105">So stoops the yellow eagle from on high ,</l>
     <l n="1106">And bears a speckled serpent through the sky ,</l>
     <l n="1107">Fastening his crooked talons on the prey :</l>
     <l n="1108">The prisoner hisses through the liquid way ;</l>
     <l n="1109">Resists the royal hawk ; and , though oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="1110">She fights in volumes , and erects her crest :</l>
     <l n="1111">Turned to her foe , she stiffens every scale ,</l>
     <l n="1112">And shoots her forky tongue , and whisks her threatening tail .</l>
     <l n="1113">Against the victor , all defence is weak :</l>
     <l n="1114">The imperial bird still plies her with his beak ;</l>
     <l n="1115">He tears her bowels , and her breast he gores ,</l>
     <l n="1116">Then claps his pinions , and securely soars .</l>
     <l n="1117">Thus , through the midst of circling enemies ,</l>
     <l n="1118">Strong Tarchon snatched and bore away his prize .</l>
     <l n="1119">The Tyrrhene troops , that shrunk before , now press</l>
     <l n="1120">The Latins , and presume the like success .</l>
     <l n="1121">Then Arruns , doomed to death , his arts essayed</l>
     <l n="1122">To murder , unespied , the Volscian maid :</l>
     <l n="1123">This way and that his winding course he bends ,</l>
     <l n="1124">And , wheresoe'er she turns , her steps attends .</l>
     <l n="1125">When she retires victorious from the chase ,</l>
     <l n="1126">He wheels about with care , and shifts his place :</l>
     <l n="1127">When , rushing on , she seeks her foes in fight ,</l>
     <l n="1128">He keeps aloof , but keeps her still in sight :</l>
     <l n="1129">He threats , and trembles , trying every way ,</l>
     <l n="1130">Unseen to kill , and safely to betray .</l>
     <l n="1131">Chloreus , the priest of Cybele , from far ,</l>
     <l n="1132">Glittering in Phrygian arms amidst the war ,</l>
     <l n="1133">Was by the virgin viewed . The steed he pressed</l>
     <l n="1134">Was proud with trappings ; and his brawny chest</l>
     <l n="1135">With scales of gilded brass was covered o'er :</l>
     <l n="1136">A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore .</l>
     <l n="1137">With deadly wounds he galled the distant foe ;</l>
     <l n="1138">Gnossian his shafts , and Lycian was his bow :</l>
     <l n="1139">A golden helm his front and head surrounds ;</l>
     <l n="1140">A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds .</l>
     <l n="1141">Gold , weaved with linen , on his thighs he wore , }</l>
     <l n="1142">With flowers of needle-work distinguished o'er , }</l>
     <l n="1143">With golden buckles bound , and gathered up before . }</l>
     <l n="1144">Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1145">Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize ,</l>
     <l n="1146">Or that the temple might his trophies hold ,</l>
     <l n="1147">Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold .</l>
     <l n="1148">Blind in her haste , she chases him alone ,</l>
     <l n="1149">And seeks his life , regardless of her own .</l>
     <l n="1150">This lucky moment the sly traitor chose ;</l>
     <l n="1151">Then , starting from his ambush , up he rose ,</l>
     <l n="1152">And threw , but first to heaven addressed his vows :—</l>
     <l n="1153">“ O patron of Soracte 's high abodes !</l>
     <l n="1154">Phœbus , the ruling power among the gods !</l>
     <l n="1155">Whom first we serve : whole woods of unctuous pine</l>
     <l n="1156">Are felled for thee , and to thy glory shine ;</l>
     <l n="1157">By thee protected , with our naked soles ,</l>
     <l n="1158">Through flames unsinged we march , and tread the kindled coals .</l>
     <l n="1159">Give me , propitious power , to wash away</l>
     <l n="1160">The stains of this dishonourable day :</l>
     <l n="1161">Nor spoils , nor triumph , from the fact I claim ,</l>
     <l n="1162">But with my future actions trust my fame .</l>
     <l n="1163">Let me , by stealth , this female plague o'ercome ,</l>
     <l n="1164">And from the field return inglorious home . ”</l>
     <l n="1165">Apollo heard , and , granting half his prayer ,</l>
     <l n="1166">Shuffled in winds the rest , and tossed in empty air .</l>
     <l n="1167">He gives the death desired : his safe return</l>
     <l n="1168">By southern tempests to the seas is borne .</l>
     <l n="1169">Now , when the javelin whizzed along the skies ,</l>
     <l n="1170">Both armies on Camilla turned their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1171">Directed by the sound . Of either host ,</l>
     <l n="1172">The unhappy virgin , though concerned the most ,</l>
     <l n="1173">Was only deaf ; so greedy was she bent</l>
     <l n="1174">On golden spoils , and on her prey intent ;</l>
     <l n="1175">Till in her pap the winged weapon stood</l>
     <l n="1176">Infixed , and deeply drunk the purple blood .</l>
     <l n="1177">Her sad attendants hasten to sustain</l>
     <l n="1178">Their dying lady drooping on the plain .</l>
     <l n="1179">Far from their sight the trembling Arruns flies ,</l>
     <l n="1180">With beating heart , and fear confused with joys ;</l>
     <l n="1181">Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow ,</l>
     <l n="1182">Or even to bear the sight of his expiring foe .</l>
     <l n="1183">As , when the wolf has torn a bullock 's hide</l>
     <l n="1184">At unawares , or ranched a shepherd 's side ,</l>
     <l n="1185">Conscious of his audacious deed , he flies ,</l>
     <l n="1186">And claps his quivering tail between his thighs :</l>
     <l n="1187">So , speeding once , the wretch no more attends ,</l>
     <l n="1188">But , spurring forward , herds among his friends .</l>
     <l n="1189">She wrenched the javelin with her dying hands ,</l>
     <l n="1190">But wedged within her breast the weapon stands :</l>
     <l n="1191">The wood she draws , the steely point remains ;</l>
     <l n="1192">She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains ;</l>
     <l n="1193">( A gathering mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1194">And from her cheeks the rosy colour flies ;)</l>
     <l n="1195">Then turns to her , whom , of her female train ,</l>
     <l n="1196">She trusted most , and thus she speaks with pain :—</l>
     <l n="1197">“ Acca , ‘ tis past ! he swims before my sight ,</l>
     <l n="1198">Inexorable Death ; and claims his right .</l>
     <l n="1199">Bear my last words to Turnus : fly with speed ,</l>
     <l n="1200">And bid him timely to my charge succeed ,</l>
     <l n="1201">Repel the Trojans , and the town relieve :—</l>
     <l n="1202">Farewell ! and in this kiss my parting breath receive . ”</l>
     <l n="1203">She said , and , sliding , sunk upon the plain :</l>
     <l n="1204">Dying , her opened hand forsakes the rein ;</l>
     <l n="1205">Short , and more short , she pants : by slow degrees</l>
     <l n="1206">Her mind the passage from her body frees .</l>
     <l n="1207">She drops her sword ; she nods her plumy crest ,</l>
     <l n="1208">Her drooping head declining on her breast :</l>
     <l n="1209">In the last sigh her struggling soul expires ,</l>
     <l n="1210">And , murmuring with disdain , to Stygian sounds retires .</l>
     <l n="1211">A shout , that struck the golden stars , ensued ;</l>
     <l n="1212">Despair and rage , and languished fight renewed .</l>
     <l n="1213">The Trojan troops and Tuscans , in a line ,</l>
     <l n="1214">Advance to charge ; the mixed Arcadians join .</l>
     <l n="1215">But Cynthia 's maid , high seated , from afar</l>
     <l n="1216">Surveys the field , and fortune of the war ,</l>
     <l n="1217">Unmoved a while , till , prostrate on the plain , }</l>
     <l n="1218">Weltering in blood , she sees Camilla slain , }</l>
     <l n="1219">And , round her corpse , of friends and foes a fighting train . }</l>
     <l n="1220">Then , from the bottom of her breast , she drew</l>
     <l n="1221">A mournful sigh , and these sad words ensue :—</l>
     <l n="1222">“ Too dear a fine , ah much lamented maid !</l>
     <l n="1223">For warring with the Trojans , thou hast paid :</l>
     <l n="1224">Nor aught availed , in this unhappy strife ,</l>
     <l n="1225">Diana 's sacred arms , to save thy life .</l>
     <l n="1226">Yet unrevenged thy goddess will not leave</l>
     <l n="1227">Her votary 's death , nor with vain sorrow grieve .</l>
     <l n="1228">Branded the wretch , and be his name abhorred ;</l>
     <l n="1229">But after-ages shall thy praise record .</l>
     <l n="1230">The inglorious coward soon shall press the plain :</l>
     <l n="1231">Thus vows thy queen , and thus the Fates ordain . ”</l>
     <l n="1232">High o'er the field , there stood a hilly mound —</l>
     <l n="1233">Sacred the place , and spread with oaks around —</l>
     <l n="1234">Where , in a marble tomb , Dercennus lay ,</l>
     <l n="1235">A king that once in Latium bore the sway .</l>
     <l n="1236">The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight ,</l>
     <l n="1237">To mark the traitor Arruns from the height .</l>
     <l n="1238">Him in refulgent arms she soon espied ,</l>
     <l n="1239">Swoln with success ; and loudly thus she cried :—</l>
     <l n="1240">“ Thy backward steps , vain boaster , are too late ;</l>
     <l n="1241">Turn , like a man , at length , and meet thy fate .</l>
     <l n="1242">Charged with my message to Camilla go , }</l>
     <l n="1243">And say I sent thee to the shades below — }</l>
     <l n="1244">An honour undeserved from Cynthia 's bow . ” }</l>
     <l n="1245">She said , and from her quiver chose with speed</l>
     <l n="1246">The winged shaft , predestined for the deed ;</l>
     <l n="1247">Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied ,</l>
     <l n="1248">Till the far distant horns approached on either side .</l>
     <l n="1249">The bow-string touched her breast , so strong she drew ;</l>
     <l n="1250">Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew .</l>
     <l n="1251">At once the twanging bow and sounding dart</l>
     <l n="1252">The traitor heard , and felt the point within his heart .</l>
     <l n="1253">Him beating with his heels in pangs of death ,</l>
     <l n="1254">His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath .</l>
     <l n="1255">The conquering damsel , with expanded wings ,</l>
     <l n="1256">The welcome message to her mistress brings .</l>
     <l n="1257">Their leader lost , the Volscians quit the field ;</l>
     <l n="1258">And , unsustained , the chiefs of Turnus yield .</l>
     <l n="1259">The frighted soldiers , when their captains fly ,</l>
     <l n="1260">More on their speed than on their strength rely .</l>
     <l n="1261">Confused in flight , they bear each other down ,</l>
     <l n="1262">And spur their horses headlong to the town .</l>
     <l n="1263">Driven by their foes , and to their fears resigned ,</l>
     <l n="1264">Not once they turn , but take their wounds behind .</l>
     <l n="1265">These drop the shield , and those the lance forego ,</l>
     <l n="1266">Or on their shoulders bear the slackened bow .</l>
     <l n="1267">The hoofs of horses , with a rattling sound ,</l>
     <l n="1268">Beat short and thick , and shake the rotten ground .</l>
     <l n="1269">Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="1270">And o'er the darkened walls and rampires fly .</l>
     <l n="1271">The trembling matrons , from their lofty stands ,</l>
     <l n="1272">Rend heaven with female shrieks , and wring their hands .</l>
     <l n="1273">All pressing on , pursuers and pursued ,</l>
     <l n="1274">Are crushed in crowds , a mingled multitude .</l>
     <l n="1275">Some happy few escape : the throng too late</l>
     <l n="1276">Rush on for entrance , till they choke the gate .</l>
     <l n="1277">Even in the sight of home , the wretched sire</l>
     <l n="1278">Looks on , and sees his helpless son expire ,</l>
     <l n="1279">Then , in a fright , the folding gates they close ,</l>
     <l n="1280">But leave their friends excluded with their foes .</l>
     <l n="1281">The vanquished cry ; the victors loudly shout ;</l>
     <l n="1282">‘ Tis terror all within , and slaughter all without .</l>
     <l n="1283">Blind in their fear , they bounce against the wall ,</l>
     <l n="1284">Or , to the moats pursued , precipitate their fall .</l>
     <l n="1285">The Latian virgins , valiant with despair ,</l>
     <l n="1286">Armed on the towers , the common danger share :</l>
     <l n="1287">So much of zeal their country 's cause inspired ;</l>
     <l n="1288">So much Camilla 's great example fired .</l>
     <l n="1289">Poles , sharpened in the flames , from high they throw ,</l>
     <l n="1290">With imitated darts to gall the foe .</l>
     <l n="1291">Their lives , for godlike freedom , they bequeath ,</l>
     <l n="1292">And crowd each other to be first in death .</l>
     <l n="1293">Meantime to Turnus , ambushed in the shade ,</l>
     <l n="1294">With heavy tidings came the unhappy maid :—</l>
     <l n="1295">“ The Volscians overthrown — Camilla killed —</l>
     <l n="1296">The foes entirely masters of the field ,</l>
     <l n="1297">Like a resistless flood , come rolling on :</l>
     <l n="1298">The cry goes off the plain , and thickens to the town . ”</l>
     <l n="1299">Inflamed with rage , ( for so the Furies fire</l>
     <l n="1300">The Daunian 's breast , and so the Fates require ,)</l>
     <l n="1301">He leaves the hilly pass , the woods in vain</l>
     <l n="1302">Possessed , and downward issues on the plain .</l>
     <l n="1303">Scarce was he gone , when to the straits , now freed</l>
     <l n="1304">From secret foes , the Trojan troops succeed .</l>
     <l n="1305">Through the black forest and the ferny brake ,</l>
     <l n="1306">Unknowingly secure , their way they take ,</l>
     <l n="1307">From the rough mountains to the plain descend ,</l>
     <l n="1308">And there , in order drawn , their line extend .</l>
     <l n="1309">Both armies now in open fields are seen ;</l>
     <l n="1310">Not far the distance of the space between .</l>
     <l n="1311">Both to the city bend . Æneas sees ,</l>
     <l n="1312">Through smoking fields , his hastening enemies ;</l>
     <l n="1313">And Turnus views the Trojans in array ,</l>
     <l n="1314">And hears the approaching horses proudly neigh .</l>
     <l n="1315">Soon had their hosts in bloody battle joined ;</l>
     <l n="1316">But westward to the sea the sun declined .</l>
     <l n="1317">Intrenched before the town , both armies lie ,</l>
     <l n="1318">While night with sable wings involves the sky .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ÆNEÏS ,</head>
    <head>BOOK XII .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Turnus challenges Æneas to a single combat : articles are agreed on , but broken by the Rutuli , who wound Æneas . He is miraculously cured by Venus , forces Turnus to a duel , and concludes the poem with his death .</head>
     <l n="1">When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field ,</l>
     <l n="2">Their armies broken , and their courage quelled ,</l>
     <l n="3">Himself become the mark of public spite ,</l>
     <l n="4">His honour questioned for the promised fight —</l>
     <l n="5">The more he was with vulgar hate oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="6">The more his fury boiled within his breast :</l>
     <l n="7">He roused his vigour for the last debate ,</l>
     <l n="8">And raised his haughty soul , to meet his fate .</l>
     <l n="9">As , when the swains the Libyan lion chase ,</l>
     <l n="10">He makes a sour retreat , nor mends his pace ;</l>
     <l n="11">But , if the pointed javelin pierce his side ,</l>
     <l n="12">The lordly beast returns with double pride :</l>
     <l n="13">He wrenches out the steel , he roars for pain ,</l>
     <l n="14">His sides he lashes , and erects his mane :</l>
     <l n="15">So Turnus fares : his eyeballs flash with fire ;</l>
     <l n="16">Through his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire .</l>
     <l n="17">Trembling with rage , around the court he ran ,</l>
     <l n="18">At length approached the king , and thus began :—</l>
     <l n="19">“ No more excuses or delays : I stand }</l>
     <l n="20">In arms prepared to combat , hand to hand , }</l>
     <l n="21">This base deserter of his native land . }</l>
     <l n="22">The Trojan , by his word , is bound to take</l>
     <l n="23">The same conditions which himself did make .</l>
     <l n="24">Renew the truce ; the solemn rites prepare ,</l>
     <l n="25">And to my single virtue trust the war .</l>
     <l n="26">The Latians unconcerned shall see the fight :</l>
     <l n="27">This arm unaided shall assert your right :</l>
     <l n="28">Then , if my prostrate body press the plain ,</l>
     <l n="29">To him the crown and beauteous bride remain . ”</l>
     <l n="30">To whom the king sedately thus replied :—</l>
     <l n="31">“ Brave youth ! the more your valour has been tried ,</l>
     <l n="32">The more becomes it us , with due respect ,</l>
     <l n="33">To weigh the chance of war , which you neglect .</l>
     <l n="34">You want not wealth , or a successive throne ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or cities which your arms have made your own :</l>
     <l n="36">My towns and treasures are at your command ,</l>
     <l n="37">And stored with blooming beauties is my land :</l>
     <l n="38">Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees ,</l>
     <l n="39">Unmarried , fair , of noble families .</l>
     <l n="40">Now let me speak , and you with patience hear ,</l>
     <l n="41">Things which perhaps may grate a lover 's ear ,</l>
     <l n="42">But sound advice , proceeding from a heart</l>
     <l n="43">Sincerely yours , and free from fraudful art .</l>
     <l n="44">The gods , by signs , have manifestly shown ,</l>
     <l n="45">No prince , Italian born , should heir my throne :</l>
     <l n="46">Oft have our augurs , in prediction skilled ,</l>
     <l n="47">And oft our priests , a foreign son revealed .</l>
     <l n="48">Yet , won by worth that cannot be withstood ,</l>
     <l n="49">Bribed by my kindness to my kindred blood ,</l>
     <l n="50">Urged by my wife , who would not be denied ,</l>
     <l n="51">I promised my Lavinia for your bride :</l>
     <l n="52">Her from her plighted lord by force I took ;</l>
     <l n="53">All ties of treaties , and of honour , broke :</l>
     <l n="54">On your account I waged an impious war — }</l>
     <l n="55">With what success , ‘ tis needless to declare ; }</l>
     <l n="56">I and my subjects feel , and you have had your share . }</l>
     <l n="57">Twice vanquished while in bloody fields we strive ,</l>
     <l n="58">Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive :</l>
     <l n="59">The rolling flood runs warm with human gore ;</l>
     <l n="60">The bones of Latians blanch the neighbouring shore .</l>
     <l n="61">Why put I not an end to this debate ,</l>
     <l n="62">Still unresolved , and still a slave to fate ?</l>
     <l n="63">If Turnus ’ death a lasting peace can give ,</l>
     <l n="64">Why should I not procure it whilst you live ?</l>
     <l n="65">Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray ,</l>
     <l n="66">What would my kinsmen , the Rutulians , say ?</l>
     <l n="67">And , should you fall in fight , ( which heaven defend ! ) }</l>
     <l n="68">How curse the cause , which hastened to his end }</l>
     <l n="69">The daughter 's lover , and the father 's friend ? }</l>
     <l n="70">Weigh in your mind the various chance of war ;</l>
     <l n="71">Pity your parent 's age , and ease his care . ”</l>
     <l n="72">Such balmy words he poured , but all in vain :</l>
     <l n="73">The proffered medicine but provoked the pain .</l>
     <l n="74">The wrathful youth , disdaining the relief ,</l>
     <l n="75">With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief :—</l>
     <l n="76">“ The care , O best of fathers ! which you take</l>
     <l n="77">For my concerns , at my desire forsake .</l>
     <l n="78">Permit me not to languish out my days ,</l>
     <l n="79">But make the best exchange of life for praise .</l>
     <l n="80">This arm , this lance , can well dispute the prize ;</l>
     <l n="81">And the blood follows , where the weapon flies .</l>
     <l n="82">His goddess mother is not near , to shrowd</l>
     <l n="83">The flying coward with an empty cloud . ”</l>
     <l n="84">But now the queen , who feared for Turnus ’ life ,</l>
     <l n="85">And loathed the hard conditions of the strife ,</l>
     <l n="86">Held him by force ; and , dying in his death ,</l>
     <l n="87">In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath :—</l>
     <l n="88">“ O Turnus ! I adjure thee by these tears ,</l>
     <l n="89">And whate'er price Amata 's honour bears</l>
     <l n="90">Within thy breast , since thou art all my hope ,</l>
     <l n="91">My sickly mind 's repose , my sinking age 's prop —</l>
     <l n="92">Since on the safety of thy life alone</l>
     <l n="93">Depends Latinus , and the Latian throne —</l>
     <l n="94">Refuse me not this one , this only prayer ,</l>
     <l n="95">To wave the combat , and pursue the war .</l>
     <l n="96">Whatever chance attends this fatal strife ,</l>
     <l n="97">Think it includes , in thine , Amata 's life .</l>
     <l n="98">I cannot live a slave , or see my throne</l>
     <l n="99">Usurped by strangers , or a Trojan son . ”</l>
     <l n="100">At this , a flood of tears Lavinia shed ; }</l>
     <l n="101">A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread , }</l>
     <l n="102">Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red .<span corresp="#note13" type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>}</l>
     <l n="103">The driving colours , never at a stay ,</l>
     <l n="104">Run here and there , and flush , and fade away .</l>
     <l n="105">Delightful change ! thus Indian ivory shows , }</l>
     <l n="106">Which with the bordering paint of purple glows ; }</l>
     <l n="107">Or lilies damasked by the neighbouring rose . }</l>
     <l n="108">The lover gazed , and , burning with desire ,</l>
     <l n="109">The more he looked , the more he fed the fire :</l>
     <l n="110">Revenge , and jealous rage , and secret spite ,</l>
     <l n="111">Roll in his breast , and rouse him to the fight .</l>
     <l n="112">Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes ,</l>
     <l n="113">Firm to his first intent , he thus replies :—</l>
     <l n="114">“ O mother ! do not by your tears prepare</l>
     <l n="115">Such boding omens , and prejudge the war .</l>
     <l n="116">Resolved on fight , I am no longer free</l>
     <l n="117">To shun my death , if heaven my death decree . ” —</l>
     <l n="118">Then turning to the herald , thus pursues :</l>
     <l n="119">“ Go , greet the Trojan with ungrateful news ;</l>
     <l n="120">Denounce from me , that , when to-morrow 's light</l>
     <l n="121">Shall gild the heavens , he need not urge the fight ;</l>
     <l n="122">The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more</l>
     <l n="123">Shall dye , with mutual blood , the Latian shore :</l>
     <l n="124">Our single swords the quarrel shall decide ,</l>
     <l n="125">And to the victor be the beauteous bride . ”</l>
     <l n="126">He said , and , striding on with speedy pace ,</l>
     <l n="127">He sought his coursers of the Thracian race .</l>
     <l n="128">At his approach , they toss their heads on high ,</l>
     <l n="129">And , proudly neighing , promise victory .</l>
     <l n="130">The sires of these Orithyia sent from far ,</l>
     <l n="131">To grace Pilumnus , when he went to war .</l>
     <l n="132">The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white ,</l>
     <l n="133">Nor northern winds in fleetness matched their flight .</l>
     <l n="134">Officious grooms stand ready by his side ; }</l>
     <l n="135">And some with combs their flowing manes divide , }</l>
     <l n="136">And others stroke their chests , and gently sooth their pride . }</l>
     <l n="137">He sheathed his limbs in arms ; a tempered mass</l>
     <l n="138">Of golden metal those , and mountain-brass .</l>
     <l n="139">Then to his head his glittering helm he tied ,</l>
     <l n="140">And girt his faithful faulchion to his side .</l>
     <l n="141">In his Ætnæan forge , the god of fire</l>
     <l n="142">That faulchion laboured for the hero 's sire ,</l>
     <l n="143">Immortal keenness on the blade bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="144">And plunged it hissing in the Stygian flood .</l>
     <l n="145">Propped on a pillar , which the cieling bore ,</l>
     <l n="146">Was placed the lance Auruncan Actor wore ;</l>
     <l n="147">Which with such force he brandished in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="148">The tough ash trembled like an osier wand :</l>
     <l n="149">Then cried ,— “ O ponderous spoil of Actor slain ,</l>
     <l n="150">And never yet by Turnus tossed in vain !</l>
     <l n="151">Fail not this day thy wonted force ; but go ,</l>
     <l n="152">Sent by this hand , to pierce the Trojan foe :</l>
     <l n="153">Give me to tear his corslet from his breast ,</l>
     <l n="154">And from that eunuch head to rend the crest ;</l>
     <l n="155">Dragged in the dust , his frizzled hair to soil ,</l>
     <l n="156">Hot from the vexing iron , and smeared with fragrant oil . ”</l>
     <l n="157">Thus while he raves , from his wide nostrils flies</l>
     <l n="158">A fiery steam , and sparkles from his eyes .</l>
     <l n="159">So fares the bull in his loved female 's sight :</l>
     <l n="160">Proudly he bellows , and preludes the fight :</l>
     <l n="161">He tries his goring horns against a tree ,</l>
     <l n="162">And meditates his absent enemy :</l>
     <l n="163">He pushes at the winds ; he digs the strand</l>
     <l n="164">With his black hoofs , and spurns the yellow sand .</l>
     <l n="165">Nor less the Trojan , in his Lemnian arms ,</l>
     <l n="166">To future fight his manly courage warms :</l>
     <l n="167">He whets his fury , and with joy prepares</l>
     <l n="168">To terminate at once the lingering wars ;</l>
     <l n="169">To cheer his chiefs and tender son , relates</l>
     <l n="170">What heaven had promised , and expounds the fates .</l>
     <l n="171">Then to the Latian king he sends , to cease</l>
     <l n="172">The rage of arms , and ratify the peace .</l>
     <l n="173">The morn ensuing , from the mountain 's height ,</l>
     <l n="174">Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light ;</l>
     <l n="175">The etherial coursers , bounding from the sea ,</l>
     <l n="176">From out their flaming nostrils breathed the day ;</l>
     <l n="177">When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard ,</l>
     <l n="178">In friendly labour joined , the list prepared .</l>
     <l n="179">Beneath the walls , they measure out the space ; }</l>
     <l n="180">Then sacred altars rear , on sods of grass , }</l>
     <l n="181">Where , with religious rites , their common gods they place . }</l>
     <l n="182">In purest white , the priests their heads attire ,</l>
     <l n="183">And living waters bear , and holy fire ;</l>
     <l n="184">And , o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair ,</l>
     <l n="185">Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear .</l>
     <l n="186">In order issuing from the town , appears</l>
     <l n="187">The Latin legion , armed with pointed spears ;</l>
     <l n="188">And from the fields , advancing on a line ,</l>
     <l n="189">The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join :</l>
     <l n="190">Their various arms afford a pleasing sight :</l>
     <l n="191">A peaceful train they seem , in peace prepared for fight .</l>
     <l n="192">Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride ,</l>
     <l n="193">Glittering with gold , and vests in purple dyed —</l>
     <l n="194">Here Mnestheus , author of the Memmian line ,</l>
     <l n="195">And there Messapus , born of seed divine .</l>
     <l n="196">The sign is given ; and , round the listed space ,</l>
     <l n="197">Each man in order fills his proper place .</l>
     <l n="198">Reclining on their ample shields , they stand ,</l>
     <l n="199">And fix their pointed lances in the sand .</l>
     <l n="200">Now , studious of the sight , a numerous throng</l>
     <l n="201">Of either sex promiscuous , old and young ,</l>
     <l n="202">Swarm from the town : by those who rest behind ,</l>
     <l n="203">The gates and walls , and houses ’ tops , are lined .</l>
     <l n="204">Meantime the queen of heaven beheld the sight ,</l>
     <l n="205">With eyes unpleased , from mount Albano 's height :</l>
     <l n="206">( Since called Albano by succeeding fame ,</l>
     <l n="207">But then an empty hill , without a name . )</l>
     <l n="208">She thence surveyed the field , the Trojan powers ,</l>
     <l n="209">The Latian squadrons , and Laurentine towers .</l>
     <l n="210">Then thus the goddess of the skies bespake ,</l>
     <l n="211">With sighs and tears , the goddess of the lake ,</l>
     <l n="212">King Turnus ’ sister , once a lovely maid ,</l>
     <l n="213">Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betrayed —</l>
     <l n="214">Compressed by force , but , by the grateful god ,</l>
     <l n="215">Now made the Naïs of the neighbouring flood .</l>
     <l n="216">“ O nymph , the pride of living lakes ! ( said she )</l>
     <l n="217">O most renowned , and most beloved by me !</l>
     <l n="218">Long hast thou known , nor need I to record ,</l>
     <l n="219">The wanton sallies of my wandering lord .</l>
     <l n="220">Of every Latian fair , whom Jove misled</l>
     <l n="221">To mount by stealth my violated bed ,</l>
     <l n="222">To thee alone I grudged not his embrace ,</l>
     <l n="223">But gave a part of heaven , and an unenvied place .</l>
     <l n="224">Now learn from me thy near approaching grief ,</l>
     <l n="225">Nor think my wishes want to thy relief</l>
     <l n="226">While fortune favoured , nor heaven 's king denied</l>
     <l n="227">To lend my succour to the Latian side ,</l>
     <l n="228">I saved thy brother , and the sinking state :</l>
     <l n="229">But now he struggles with unequal fate ,</l>
     <l n="230">And goes , with gods averse , o'ermatched in might , }</l>
     <l n="231">To meet inevitable death in fight ; }</l>
     <l n="232">Nor must I break the truce , nor can sustain the sight . }</l>
     <l n="233">Thou , if thou dar'st , thy present aid supply ;</l>
     <l n="234">It well becomes a sister 's care to try . ”</l>
     <l n="235">At this the lovely nymph , with grief oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="236">Thrice tore her hair , and beat her comely breast .</l>
     <l n="237">To whom Saturnia thus :— “ Thy tears are late :</l>
     <l n="238">Haste , snatch him , if he can be snatched , from fate :</l>
     <l n="239">New tumults kindle ; violate the truce .</l>
     <l n="240">Who knows what changeful Fortune may produce ?</l>
     <l n="241">‘ Tis not a crime to attempt what I decree ;</l>
     <l n="242">Or , if it were , discharge the crime on me . ”</l>
     <l n="243">She said , and , sailing on the winged wind ,</l>
     <l n="244">Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind .</l>
     <l n="245">And now in pomp the peaceful kings appear :</l>
     <l n="246">Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear :</l>
     <l n="247">Twelve golden beams around his temples play ,</l>
     <l n="248">To mark his lineage from the god of day .</l>
     <l n="249">Two snowy coursers Turnus ’ chariot yoke ,</l>
     <l n="250">And in his hand two massy spears he shook :</l>
     <l n="251">Then issued from the camp , in arms divine ,</l>
     <l n="252">Æneas , author of the Roman line ;</l>
     <l n="253">And by his side Ascanius took his place ,</l>
     <l n="254">The second hope of Rome 's immortal race .</l>
     <l n="255">Adorned in white , a reverend priest appears , }</l>
     <l n="256">And offerings to the flaming altars bears — }</l>
     <l n="257">A porket , and a lamb that never suffered shears . }</l>
     <l n="258">Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="259">And strews the beasts , designed for sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="260">With salt and meal : with like officious care</l>
     <l n="261">He marks their foreheads , and he clips their hair .</l>
     <l n="262">Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds ;</l>
     <l n="263">With the same generous juice the flame he feeds .</l>
     <l n="264">Æneas then unsheathed his shining sword ,</l>
     <l n="265">And thus with pious prayers the gods adored :—</l>
     <l n="266">“ All-seeing sun ! and thou , Ausonian soil ,</l>
     <l n="267">For which I have sustained so long a toil ,</l>
     <l n="268">Thou , king of heaven ! and thou , the queen of air ,</l>
     <l n="269">Propitious now , and reconciled by prayer ;</l>
     <l n="270">Thou , god of war , whose unresisted sway</l>
     <l n="271">The labours and events of arms obey !</l>
     <l n="272">Ye living fountains , and ye running floods !</l>
     <l n="273">All powers of ocean , all etherial gods !</l>
     <l n="274">Hear , and bear record : if I fall in field ,</l>
     <l n="275">Or , recreant in the fight , to Turnus yield ,</l>
     <l n="276">My Trojans shall increase Evander 's town ;</l>
     <l n="277">Ascanius shall renounce the Ausonian crown :</l>
     <l n="278">All claims , all questions of debate , shall cease ;</l>
     <l n="279">Nor he , nor they , with force infringe the peace .</l>
     <l n="280">But , if my juster arms prevail in fight ,</l>
     <l n="281">( As sure they shall , if I divine aright ,)</l>
     <l n="282">My Trojans shall not o'er the Italians reign ;</l>
     <l n="283">Both equal , both unconquered , shall remain ,</l>
     <l n="284">Joined in their laws , their lands , and their abodes ;</l>
     <l n="285">I ask but altars for my weary gods .</l>
     <l n="286">The care of those religious rites be mine :</l>
     <l n="287">The crown to king Latinus I resign :</l>
     <l n="288">His be the sovereign sway . Nor will I share</l>
     <l n="289">His power in peace , or his command in war .</l>
     <l n="290">For me , my friends another town shall frame ,</l>
     <l n="291">And bless the rising towers with fair Lavinia 's name . ”</l>
     <l n="292">Thus he . Then , with erected eyes and hands ,</l>
     <l n="293">The Latian king before his altar stands .</l>
     <l n="294">“ By the same heaven , ( said he ,) and earth , and main ,</l>
     <l n="295">And all the powers that all the three contain ;</l>
     <l n="296">By hell below , and by that upper god ,</l>
     <l n="297">Whose thunder signs the peace , who seals it with his nod ;</l>
     <l n="298">So let Latona 's double offspring hear ,</l>
     <l n="299">And double-fronted Janus , what I swear :</l>
     <l n="300">I touch the sacred altars , touch the flames ,</l>
     <l n="301">And all those powers attest , and all their names :</l>
     <l n="302">Whatever chance befal on either side ,</l>
     <l n="303">No term of time this union shall divide :</l>
     <l n="304">No force , no fortune , shall my vows unbind ,</l>
     <l n="305">Or shake the stedfast tenor of my mind ;</l>
     <l n="306">Not , though the circling seas should break their bound ,</l>
     <l n="307">O'erflow the shores , or sap the solid ground ;</l>
     <l n="308">Not , though the lamps of heaven their spheres forsake ,</l>
     <l n="309">Hurled down , and hissing in the nether lake :</l>
     <l n="310">Even as this royal sceptre ” ( for he bore</l>
     <l n="311">A sceptre in his hand ) “ shall never more</l>
     <l n="312">Shoot out in branches , or renew the birth —</l>
     <l n="313">An orphan now , cut from the mother earth</l>
     <l n="314">By the keen axe , dishonoured of its hair ,</l>
     <l n="315">And cased in brass , for Latian kings to bear . ”</l>
     <l n="316">When thus in public view the peace was tied</l>
     <l n="317">With solemn vows , and sworn on either side ,</l>
     <l n="318">All dues performed which holy rites require ,</l>
     <l n="319">The victim beasts are slain before the fire ,</l>
     <l n="320">The trembling entrails from their bodies torn ,</l>
     <l n="321">And to the fatten 'd flames in chargers borne .</l>
     <l n="322">Already the Rutulians deemed their man</l>
     <l n="323">O'ermatched in arms , before the fight began .</l>
     <l n="324">First rising fears are whispered through the crowd ;</l>
     <l n="325">Then , gathering sound , they murmur more aloud .</l>
     <l n="326">Now , side to side , they measure with their eyes</l>
     <l n="327">The champions ’ bulk , their sinews , and their size :</l>
     <l n="328">The nearer they approach , the more is known</l>
     <l n="329">The apparent disadvantage of their own .</l>
     <l n="330">Turnus himself appears in public sight</l>
     <l n="331">Conscious of fate , desponding of the fight .</l>
     <l n="332">Slowly he moves , and at his altar stands</l>
     <l n="333">With eyes dejected , and with trembling hands :</l>
     <l n="334">And , while he mutters undistinguished prayers ,</l>
     <l n="335">A livid deadness in his cheeks appears .</l>
     <l n="336">With anxious pleasure when Juturna viewed</l>
     <l n="337">The increasing fright of the mad multitude ,</l>
     <l n="338">When their short sighs and thickening sobs she heard ,</l>
     <l n="339">And found their ready minds for change prepared ;</l>
     <l n="340">Dissembling her immortal form , she took</l>
     <l n="341">Camertes ’ mien , his habit , and his look —</l>
     <l n="342">A chief of ancient blood :— in arms well known</l>
     <l n="343">Was his great sire , and he his greater son .</l>
     <l n="344">His shape assumed , amid the ranks she ran ,</l>
     <l n="345">And humouring their first motions , thus began :—</l>
     <l n="346">“ For shame , Rutulians ! can you bear the sight</l>
     <l n="347">Of one exposed for all , in single fight ?</l>
     <l n="348">Can we , before the face of heaven , confess</l>
     <l n="349">Our courage colder , or our numbers less ?</l>
     <l n="350">View all the Trojan host , the Arcadian band ,</l>
     <l n="351">And Tuscan army ; count them as they stand :</l>
     <l n="352">Undaunted to the battle if we go ,</l>
     <l n="353">Scarce every second man will share a foe .</l>
     <l n="354">Turnus , ‘ tis true , in this unequal strife ,</l>
     <l n="355">Shall lose , with honour , his devoted life ,</l>
     <l n="356">Or change it rather for immortal fame ,</l>
     <l n="357">Succeeding to the gods , from whence he came :</l>
     <l n="358">But you , a servile and inglorious band ,</l>
     <l n="359">For foreign lords shall sow your native land ,</l>
     <l n="360">Those fruitful fields , your fighting fathers gained ,</l>
     <l n="361">Which have so long their lazy sons sustained . ”</l>
     <l n="362">With words like these , she carried her design .</l>
     <l n="363">A rising murmur runs along the line .</l>
     <l n="364">Then even the city troops , and Latians , tired</l>
     <l n="365">With tedious war , seem with new souls inspired :</l>
     <l n="366">Their champion 's fate with pity they lament ,</l>
     <l n="367">And of the league , so lately sworn , repent .</l>
     <l n="368">Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage</l>
     <l n="369">With lying wonders , and a false presage ;</l>
     <l n="370">But adds a sign , which , present to their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="371">Inspires new courage , and a glad surprise .</l>
     <l n="372">For , sudden , in the fiery tracts above ,</l>
     <l n="373">Appears in pomp the imperial bird of Jove :</l>
     <l n="374">A plump of fowl he spies , that swim the lakes ,</l>
     <l n="375">And o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes ;</l>
     <l n="376">Then , stooping on the fairest of the train ,</l>
     <l n="377">In his strong talons trussed a silver swan .</l>
     <l n="378">The Italians wonder at the unusual sight :</l>
     <l n="379">But while he lags , and labours in his flight ,</l>
     <l n="380">Behold , the dastard fowl return anew ,</l>
     <l n="381">And with united force the foe pursue :</l>
     <l n="382">Clamorous around the royal hawk they fly ,</l>
     <l n="383">And , thickening in a cloud , o'ershade the sky .</l>
     <l n="384">They cuff , they scratch , they cross his airy course ;</l>
     <l n="385">Nor can the encumbered bird sustain their force ;</l>
     <l n="386">But , vexed , not vanquished , drops the ponderous prey ,</l>
     <l n="387">And , lightened of his burden , wings his way .</l>
     <l n="388">The Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight ,</l>
     <l n="389">Eager of action , and demand the fight .</l>
     <l n="390">Then king Tolumnius , versed in augurs ’ arts ,</l>
     <l n="391">Cries out , and thus his boasted skill imparts :—</l>
     <l n="392">“ At length ‘ tis granted , what I long desired !</l>
     <l n="393">This , this is what my frequent vows required .</l>
     <l n="394">Ye gods ! I take your omen , and obey .—</l>
     <l n="395">Advance , my friends , and charge ! I lead the way .</l>
     <l n="396">These are the foreign foes , whose impious band ,</l>
     <l n="397">Like that rapacious bird , infest our land :</l>
     <l n="398">But soon , like him , they shall be forced to sea</l>
     <l n="399">By strength united , and forego the prey .</l>
     <l n="400">Your timely succour to your country bring ;</l>
     <l n="401">Haste to the rescue , and redeem your king . ”</l>
     <l n="402">He said : and , pressing onward through the crew ,</l>
     <l n="403">Poised in his lifted arm , his lance he threw .</l>
     <l n="404">The winged weapon , whistling in the wind ,</l>
     <l n="405">Came driving on , nor missed the mark designed .</l>
     <l n="406">At once the cornel rattled in the skies ;</l>
     <l n="407">At once tumultuous shouts and clamours rise .</l>
     <l n="408">Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood ,</l>
     <l n="409">Born of Arcadian mixed with Tuscan blood ,</l>
     <l n="410">Gylippus ’ sons ; the fatal javelin flew ,</l>
     <l n="411">Aimed at the midmost of the friendly crew .</l>
     <l n="412">A passage through the jointed arms it found , }</l>
     <l n="413">Just where the belt was to the body bound , }</l>
     <l n="414">And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground . }</l>
     <l n="415">Then , fired with pious rage , the generous train</l>
     <l n="416">Run madly forward to revenge the slain .</l>
     <l n="417">And some with eager haste their javelins throw ;</l>
     <l n="418">And some with sword in hand assault the foe .</l>
     <l n="419">The wished insult the Latine troops embrace ,</l>
     <l n="420">And meet their ardour in the middle space .</l>
     <l n="421">The Trojans , Tuscans , and Arcadian line ,</l>
     <l n="422">With equal courage obviate their design .</l>
     <l n="423">Peace leaves the violated fields ; and hate</l>
     <l n="424">Both armies urges to their mutual fate .</l>
     <l n="425">With impious haste their altars are o'erturned ,</l>
     <l n="426">The sacrifice half broiled , and half unburned .</l>
     <l n="427">Thick storms of steel from either army fly ,</l>
     <l n="428">And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky ;</l>
     <l n="429">Brands from the fire are missive weapons made ,</l>
     <l n="430">With chargers , bowls , and all the priestly trade .</l>
     <l n="431">Latinus , frighted , hastens from the fray ,</l>
     <l n="432">And bears his unregarded gods away .</l>
     <l n="433">These on their horses vault ; those yoke the car ;</l>
     <l n="434">The rest , with swords on high , run headlong to the war .</l>
     <l n="435">Messapus , eager to confound the peace ,</l>
     <l n="436">Spurred his hot courser through the fighting prease ,</l>
     <l n="437">At king Aulestes , by his purple known }</l>
     <l n="438">A Tuscan prince , and by his regal crown ; }</l>
     <l n="439">And , with a shock encountering , bore him down . }</l>
     <l n="440">Backward he fell ; and , as his fate designed ,</l>
     <l n="441">The ruins of an altar were behind :</l>
     <l n="442">There pitching on his shoulders and his head ,</l>
     <l n="443">Amid the scattering fires he lay supinely spread .</l>
     <l n="444">The beamy spear , descending from above ,</l>
     <l n="445">His cuirass pierced , and through his body drove .</l>
     <l n="446">Then , with a scornful smile , the victor cries :—</l>
     <l n="447">“ The gods have found a fitter sacrifice . ”</l>
     <l n="448">Greedy of spoils , the Italians strip the dead</l>
     <l n="449">Of his rich armour , and uncrown his head .</l>
     <l n="450">Priest Corynæus armed his better hand ,</l>
     <l n="451">From his own altar , with a blazing brand ;</l>
     <l n="452">And , as Ebusus with a thundering pace</l>
     <l n="453">Advanced to battle , dashed it on his face :</l>
     <l n="454">His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires ;</l>
     <l n="455">The crackling crop a noisome scent expires .</l>
     <l n="456">Following the blow , he seized his curling crown</l>
     <l n="457">With his left hand ; his other cast him down .</l>
     <l n="458">The prostrate body with his knees he pressed ,</l>
     <l n="459">And plunged his holy poignard in his breast .</l>
     <l n="460">While Podalirius , with his sword , pursued</l>
     <l n="461">The shepherd Alsus through the flying crowd ,</l>
     <l n="462">Swiftly he turns , and aims a deadly blow</l>
     <l n="463">Full on the front of his unwary foe .</l>
     <l n="464">The broad axe enters with a crashing sound , }</l>
     <l n="465">And cleaves the chin with one continued wound ; }</l>
     <l n="466">Warm blood , and mingled brains , besmear his arms around . }</l>
     <l n="467">An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="468">And sealed their heavy lids in endless rest .</l>
     <l n="469">But good Æneas rushed amid the bands ;</l>
     <l n="470">Bare was his head , and naked were his hands ,</l>
     <l n="471">In sign of truce : then thus he cries aloud :—</l>
     <l n="472">“ What sudden rage , what new desire of blood ,</l>
     <l n="473">Inflames your altered minds ? O Trojans ! cease</l>
     <l n="474">From impious arms , nor violate the peace .</l>
     <l n="475">By human sanctions , and by laws divine ,</l>
     <l n="476">The terms are all agreed ; the war is mine .</l>
     <l n="477">Dismiss your fears , and let the fight ensue ;</l>
     <l n="478">This hand alone shall right the gods and you :</l>
     <l n="479">Our injured altars , and their broken vow ,</l>
     <l n="480">To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe . ”</l>
     <l n="481">Thus while he spoke , unmindful of defence ,</l>
     <l n="482">A winged arrow struck the pious prince .</l>
     <l n="483">But , whether from some human hand it came ,</l>
     <l n="484">Or hostile god , is left unknown by fame :</l>
     <l n="485">No human hand , or hostile god , was found ,</l>
     <l n="486">To boast the triumph of so base a wound .</l>
     <l n="487">When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain ,</l>
     <l n="488">His chiefs dismayed , his troops a fainting train ,</l>
     <l n="489">The unhoped event his heightened soul inspires :</l>
     <l n="490">At once his arms and coursers he requires ;</l>
     <l n="491">Then , with a leap , his lofty chariot gains ,</l>
     <l n="492">And with a ready hand assumes the reins .</l>
     <l n="493">He drives impetuous , and , where'er he goes ,</l>
     <l n="494">He leaves behind a lane of slaughtered foes .</l>
     <l n="495">These his lance reaches ; over those he rolls</l>
     <l n="496">His rapid car , and crushes out their souls .</l>
     <l n="497">In vain the vanquished fly : the victor sends</l>
     <l n="498">The dead men 's weapons at their living friends .</l>
     <l n="499">Thus , on the banks of Hebrus ’ freezing flood ,</l>
     <l n="500">The god of battles , in his angry mood ,</l>
     <l n="501">Clashing his sword against his brazen shield ,</l>
     <l n="502">Lets loose the reins , and scours along the field :</l>
     <l n="503">Before the wind his fiery coursers fly ;</l>
     <l n="504">Groans the sad earth , resounds the rattling sky .</l>
     <l n="505">Wrath , Terror , Treason , Tumult , and Despair , }</l>
     <l n="506">( Dire faces , and deformed ,) surround the car — }</l>
     <l n="507">Friends of the god , and followers of the war . }</l>
     <l n="508">With fury not unlike , nor less disdain ,</l>
     <l n="509">Exulting Turnus flies along the plain :</l>
     <l n="510">His smoking horses , at their utmost speed ,</l>
     <l n="511">He lashes on ; and urges o'er the dead .</l>
     <l n="512">Their fetlocks run with blood ; and , when they bound ,</l>
     <l n="513">The gore and gathering dust are dashed around .</l>
     <l n="514">Thamyris and Pholus , masters of the war ,</l>
     <l n="515">He killed at hand , but Sthenelus afar :</l>
     <l n="516">From far the sons of Imbrasus he slew ,</l>
     <l n="517">Glaucus and Lades , of the Lycian crew —</l>
     <l n="518">Both taught to fight on foot , in battle joined ,</l>
     <l n="519">Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind .</l>
     <l n="520">Meantime Eumedes , vaunting in the field ,</l>
     <l n="521">New fired the Trojans , and their foes repelled .</l>
     <l n="522">This son of Dolon bore his grandsire 's name ,</l>
     <l n="523">But emulated more his father 's fame —</l>
     <l n="524">His guileful father , sent a nightly spy ,</l>
     <l n="525">The Grecian camp and order to descry —</l>
     <l n="526">Hard enterprise ! and well he might require</l>
     <l n="527">Achilles ’ car and horses , for his hire :</l>
     <l n="528">But , met upon the scout , the Ætolian prince</l>
     <l n="529">In death bestowed a juster recompense .</l>
     <l n="530">Fierce Turnus viewed the Trojan from afar ,</l>
     <l n="531">And launched his javelin from his lofty car ,</l>
     <l n="532">Then lightly leaping down , pursued the blow ,</l>
     <l n="533">And , pressing with his foot his prostrate foe ,</l>
     <l n="534">Wrenched from his feeble hold the shining sword ,</l>
     <l n="535">And plunged it in the bosom of its lord .</l>
     <l n="536">“ Possess , ” said he , “ the fruit of all thy pains ,</l>
     <l n="537">And measure , at thy length , our Latian plains .</l>
     <l n="538">Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand ;</l>
     <l n="539">Thus may they build their town , and thus enjoy the land ! ”</l>
     <l n="540">Then Dares , Butes , Sybaris , he slew ,</l>
     <l n="541">Whom o'er his neck the floundering courser threw .</l>
     <l n="542">As when loud Boreas , with his blustering train ,</l>
     <l n="543">Stoops from above , incumbent on the main ;</l>
     <l n="544">Where'er he flies , he drives the rack before ,</l>
     <l n="545">And rolls the billows on the Ægæan shore :</l>
     <l n="546">So , where resistless Turnus takes his course ,</l>
     <l n="547">The scattered squadrons bend before his force :</l>
     <l n="548">His crest of horses hair is blown behind</l>
     <l n="549">By adverse air , and rustles in the wind .</l>
     <l n="550">This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain , }</l>
     <l n="551">And , as the chariot rolled along the plain , }</l>
     <l n="552">Light from the ground he leapt , and seized the rein . }</l>
     <l n="553">Thus hung in air , he still retained his hold ,</l>
     <l n="554">The coursers frighted , and their course controuled .</l>
     <l n="555">The lance of Turnus reached him as he hung ,</l>
     <l n="556">And pierced his plated arms , but passed along ,</l>
     <l n="557">And only razed the skin . He turned , and held</l>
     <l n="558">Against his threatening foe his ample shield ,</l>
     <l n="559">Then called for aid : but , while he cried in vain ,</l>
     <l n="560">The chariot bore him backward on the plain .</l>
     <l n="561">He lies reversed ; the victor king descends ,</l>
     <l n="562">And strikes so justly where his helmet ends ,</l>
     <l n="563">He lops the head . The Latian fields are drunk</l>
     <l n="564">With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk .</l>
     <l n="565">While he triumphs , and while the Trojans yield ,</l>
     <l n="566">The wounded prince is forced to leave the field :</l>
     <l n="567">Strong Mnestheus , and Achates often tried ,</l>
     <l n="568">And young Ascanius , weeping by his side ,</l>
     <l n="569">Conduct him to his tent . Scarce can he rear</l>
     <l n="570">His limbs from earth , supported on his spear .</l>
     <l n="571">Resolved in mind , regardless of the smart ,</l>
     <l n="572">He tugs with both his hands , and breaks the dart .</l>
     <l n="573">The steel remains . No readier way he found</l>
     <l n="574">To draw the weapon , than to enlarge the wound .</l>
     <l n="575">Eager of fight , impatient of delay ,</l>
     <l n="576">He begs ; and his unwilling friends obey .</l>
     <l n="577">Iäpis was at hand to prove his art ,</l>
     <l n="578">Whose blooming youth so fired Apollo 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="579">That , for his love , he proffered to bestow</l>
     <l n="580">His tuneful harp , and his unerring bow :</l>
     <l n="581">The pious youth , more studious how to save</l>
     <l n="582">His aged sire now sinking to the grave ,</l>
     <l n="583">Preferred the power of plants , and silent praise</l>
     <l n="584">Of healing arts , before Phœbean bays .</l>
     <l n="585">Propped on his lance the pensive hero stood ,</l>
     <l n="586">And heard and saw , unmoved , the mourning crowd .</l>
     <l n="587">The famed physician tucks his robes around</l>
     <l n="588">With ready hands , and hastens to the wound .</l>
     <l n="589">With gentle touches he performs his part , }</l>
     <l n="590">This way and that , soliciting the dart , }</l>
     <l n="591">And exercises all his heavenly art . }</l>
     <l n="592">All softening simples , known of sovereign use ,</l>
     <l n="593">He presses out , and pours their noble juice .</l>
     <l n="594">These first infused , to lenify the pain —</l>
     <l n="595">He tugs with pincers , but he tugs in vain .</l>
     <l n="596">Then to the patron of his art he prayed :</l>
     <l n="597">The patron of his art refused his aid .</l>
     <l n="598">Meantime the war approaches to the tents :</l>
     <l n="599">The alarm grows hotter , and the noise augments :</l>
     <l n="600">The driving dust proclaims the danger near ; }</l>
     <l n="601">And first their friends , and then their foes , appear : }</l>
     <l n="602">Their friends retreat ; their foes pursue the rear . }</l>
     <l n="603">The camp is filled with terror and affright :</l>
     <l n="604">The hissing shafts within the trench alight ;</l>
     <l n="605">An undistinguished noise ascends the sky —</l>
     <l n="606">The shouts of those who kill , and groans of those who die .</l>
     <l n="607">But now the goddess mother , moved with grief ,</l>
     <l n="608">And pierced with pity , hastens her relief .</l>
     <l n="609">A branch of healing dittany she brought ,</l>
     <l n="610">Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought —</l>
     <l n="611">( Rough is the stem , which woolly leaves surround ;</l>
     <l n="612">The leaves with flowers , the flowers with purple crowned ,)</l>
     <l n="613">Well known to wounded goats ; a sure relief</l>
     <l n="614">To draw the pointed steel , and ease the grief .</l>
     <l n="615">This Venus brings , in clouds involved , and brews</l>
     <l n="616">The extracted liquor with ambrosian dews ,</l>
     <l n="617">And odorous panacee . Unseen she stands ,</l>
     <l n="618">Tempering the mixture with her heavenly hands ,</l>
     <l n="619">And pours it in a bowl , already crowned</l>
     <l n="620">With juice of medicinal herbs prepared to bathe the wound .</l>
     <l n="621">The leech , unknowing of superior art }</l>
     <l n="622">Which aids the cure , with this foments the part ; }</l>
     <l n="623">And in a moment ceased the raging smart . }</l>
     <l n="624">Stanched is the blood , and in the bottom stands :</l>
     <l n="625">The steel , but scarcely touched with tender hands ,</l>
     <l n="626">Moves up , and follows of its own accord ,</l>
     <l n="627">And health and vigour are at once restored .</l>
     <l n="628">Iäpis first perceived the closing wound ,</l>
     <l n="629">And first the footsteps of a god he found .</l>
     <l n="630">“ Arms ! arms ! ” he cries : “ the sword and shield prepare ,</l>
     <l n="631">And send the willing chief , renewed , to war .</l>
     <l n="632">This is no mortal work , no cure of mine ,</l>
     <l n="633">Nor art 's effect , but done by hands divine .</l>
     <l n="634">Some god our general to the battle sends ;</l>
     <l n="635">Some god preserves his life for greater ends . ”</l>
     <l n="636">The hero arms in haste : his hands enfold</l>
     <l n="637">His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold :</l>
     <l n="638">Inflamed to fight , and rushing to the field ,</l>
     <l n="639">That hand sustaining the celestial shield ,</l>
     <l n="640">This gripes the lance , and with such vigour shakes ,</l>
     <l n="641">That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes .</l>
     <l n="642">Then with a close embrace he strained his son ,</l>
     <l n="643">And , kissing through his helmet , thus begun :—</l>
     <l n="644">“ My son ! from my example learn the war , }</l>
     <l n="645">In camps to suffer , and in fields to dare ; }</l>
     <l n="646">But happier chance than mine attend thy care ! }</l>
     <l n="647">This day my hand thy tender age shall shield ,</l>
     <l n="648">And crown with honours of the conquered field :</l>
     <l n="649">Thou , when thy riper years shall send thee forth</l>
     <l n="650">To toils of war , be mindful of my worth :</l>
     <l n="651">Assert thy birth-right ; and in arms be known ,</l>
     <l n="652">For Hector 's nephew , and Æneas ’ son . ”</l>
     <l n="653">He said ; and , striding , issued on the plain .</l>
     <l n="654">Antheus and Mnestheus , and a numerous train ,</l>
     <l n="655">Attend his steps : the rest their weapons take ,</l>
     <l n="656">And , crowding to the field , the camp forsake .</l>
     <l n="657">A cloud of blinding dust is raised around ,</l>
     <l n="658">Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground .</l>
     <l n="659">Now Turnus , posted on a hill , from far</l>
     <l n="660">Beheld the progress of the moving war :</l>
     <l n="661">With him the Latins viewed the covered plains ,</l>
     <l n="662">And the chill blood ran backward in their veins .</l>
     <l n="663">Juturna saw the advancing troops appear ,</l>
     <l n="664">And heard the hostile sound , and fled for fear .</l>
     <l n="665">Æneas leads ; and draws a sweeping train ,</l>
     <l n="666">Closed in their ranks , and pouring on the plain .</l>
     <l n="667">As when a whirlwind , rushing to the shore</l>
     <l n="668">From the mid ocean , drives the waves before ;</l>
     <l n="669">The painful hind with heavy heart foresees</l>
     <l n="670">The flatted fields , and slaughter of the trees ;</l>
     <l n="671">With such impetuous rage the prince appears ,</l>
     <l n="672">Before his doubled front , nor less destruction bears .</l>
     <l n="673">And now both armies shock in open field ;</l>
     <l n="674">Osiris is by strong Thymbræus killed .</l>
     <l n="675">Archetius , Ufens , Epulon , are slain ,</l>
     <l n="676">( All famed in arms , and of the Latian train ,)</l>
     <l n="677">By Gyas ’ , Mnestheus ’ , and Achates ’ hand .</l>
     <l n="678">The fatal augur falls , by whose command</l>
     <l n="679">The truce was broken , and whose lance , embrued</l>
     <l n="680">With Trojan blood , the unhappy fight renewed .</l>
     <l n="681">Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky ;</l>
     <l n="682">And o'er the field the frighted Latins fly .</l>
     <l n="683">The prince disdains the dastards to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="684">Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few .</l>
     <l n="685">Turnus alone , amid the dusky plain ,</l>
     <l n="686">He seeks , and to the combat calls in vain .</l>
     <l n="687">Juturna heard , and , seized with mortal fear ,</l>
     <l n="688">Forced from the beam her brother 's charioteer ;</l>
     <l n="689">Assumes his shape , his armour , and his mien ,</l>
     <l n="690">And , like Metiscus , in his seat is seen .</l>
     <l n="691">As the black swallow near the palace plies ;</l>
     <l n="692">O'er empty courts , and under arches , flies ;</l>
     <l n="693">Now hawks aloft , now skims along the flood ,</l>
     <l n="694">To furnish her loquacious nest with food :</l>
     <l n="695">So drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains ;</l>
     <l n="696">The smoking horses run with loosened reins .</l>
     <l n="697">She steers a various course among the foes ;</l>
     <l n="698">Now here , now there , her conquering brother shows ;</l>
     <l n="699">Now with a straight , now with a wheeling flight ,</l>
     <l n="700">She turns , and bends , but shuns the single fight .</l>
     <l n="701">Æneas , fired with fury , breaks the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="702">And seeks his foe , and calls by name aloud :</l>
     <l n="703">He runs within a narrower ring , and tries</l>
     <l n="704">To stop the chariot ; but the chariot flies .</l>
     <l n="705">If he but gain a glimpse , Juturna fears ,</l>
     <l n="706">And far away the Daunian hero bears .</l>
     <l n="707">What should he do ? Nor arts nor arms avail ;</l>
     <l n="708">And various cares in vain his mind assail .</l>
     <l n="709">The great Messapus , thundering through the field ,</l>
     <l n="710">In his left hand two pointed javelins held :</l>
     <l n="711">Encountering on the prince , one dart he drew ,</l>
     <l n="712">And with unerring aim , and utmost vigour , threw .</l>
     <l n="713">Æneas saw it come , and , stooping low</l>
     <l n="714">Beneath his buckler , shunned the threat'ning blow .</l>
     <l n="715">The weapon hissed above his head , and tore</l>
     <l n="716">The waving plume , which on his helm he wore .</l>
     <l n="717">Forced by this hostile act , and fired with spite ,</l>
     <l n="718">That flying Turnus still declined the fight ,</l>
     <l n="719">The prince , whose piety had long repelled</l>
     <l n="720">His inborn ardour , now invades the field ;</l>
     <l n="721">Invokes the powers of violated peace ,</l>
     <l n="722">Their rites and injured altars to redress ;</l>
     <l n="723">Then , to his rage abandoning the rein ,</l>
     <l n="724">With blood and slaughtered bodies fills the plain .</l>
     <l n="725">What god can tell , what numbers can display ,</l>
     <l n="726">The various labours of that fatal day ?</l>
     <l n="727">What chiefs and champions fell on either side ,</l>
     <l n="728">In combat slain , or by what deaths they died ?</l>
     <l n="729">Whom Turnus , whom the Trojan hero killed ?</l>
     <l n="730">Who shared the fame and fortune of the field ?</l>
     <l n="731">Jove ! could'st thou view , and not avert thy sight , }</l>
     <l n="732">Two jarring nations joined in cruel fight , }</l>
     <l n="733">Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite ? }</l>
     <l n="734">Æneas first Rutulian Sucro found ,</l>
     <l n="735">Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground ;</l>
     <l n="736">Betwixt his ribs the javelin drove so just ,</l>
     <l n="737">It reached his heart , nor needs a second thrust .</l>
     <l n="738">Now Turnus , at two blows , two brethren slew ;</l>
     <l n="739">First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw :</l>
     <l n="740">Then , leaping on the ground , on foot assailed</l>
     <l n="741">Diores , and in equal fight prevailed .</l>
     <l n="742">Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place ;</l>
     <l n="743">Their heads , distilling gore , his chariot grace .</l>
     <l n="744">Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw ,</l>
     <l n="745">Whom without respite at one charge he slew :</l>
     <l n="746">Cethegus , Tanaïs , Talus , fell oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="747">And sad Onytes , added to the rest —</l>
     <l n="748">Of Theban blood , whom Peridia bore .</l>
     <l n="749">Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore ,</l>
     <l n="750">And from Apollo 's fane to battle sent ,</l>
     <l n="751">O'erthrew ; nor Phœbus could their fate prevent .</l>
     <l n="752">Peaceful Menœtes after these he killed ,</l>
     <l n="753">Who long had shunned the dangers of the field :</l>
     <l n="754">On Lerna 's lake a silent life he led ,</l>
     <l n="755">And with his nets and angle earned his bread .</l>
     <l n="756">Nor pompous cares , nor palaces , he knew ,</l>
     <l n="757">But wisely from the infectious world withdrew .</l>
     <l n="758">Poor was his house : his father 's painful hand</l>
     <l n="759">Discharged his rent , and ploughed another 's land .</l>
     <l n="760">As flames among the lofty woods are thrown</l>
     <l n="761">On different sides , and both by winds are blown ;</l>
     <l n="762">The laurels crackle in the sputtering fire ;</l>
     <l n="763">The frighted sylvans from their shades retire :</l>
     <l n="764">Or as two neighbouring torrents fall from high ,</l>
     <l n="765">Rapid they run ; the foamy waters fry ;</l>
     <l n="766">They roll to sea with unresisted force ,</l>
     <l n="767">And down the rocks precipitate their course</l>
     <l n="768">Not with less rage the rival heroes take</l>
     <l n="769">Their different ways ; nor less destruction make .</l>
     <l n="770">With spears afar , with swords at hand , they strike ;</l>
     <l n="771">And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike .</l>
     <l n="772">Like them , their dauntless men maintain the field ;</l>
     <l n="773">And hearts are pierced , unknowing how to yield :</l>
     <l n="774">They blow for blow return , and wound for wound ;</l>
     <l n="775">And heaps of bodies raise the level ground .</l>
     <l n="776">Murrhanus , boasting of his blood , that springs</l>
     <l n="777">From a long royal race of Latian kings ,</l>
     <l n="778">Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown ,</l>
     <l n="779">Crushed with the weight of an unwieldy stone :</l>
     <l n="780">Betwixt the wheels he fell ; the wheels , that bore</l>
     <l n="781">His living load , his dying body tore .</l>
     <l n="782">His starting steeds , to shun the glittering sword ,</l>
     <l n="783">Paw down his trampled limbs , forgetful of their lord .</l>
     <l n="784">Fierce Hyllus threatened high , and , face to face ,</l>
     <l n="785">Affronted Turnus in the middle space :</l>
     <l n="786">The prince encountered him in full career ,</l>
     <l n="787">And at his temples aimed the deadly spear :</l>
     <l n="788">So fatally the flying weapon sped ,</l>
     <l n="789">That through his brazen helm it pierced his head .</l>
     <l n="790">Nor , Cisseus , could'st thou ‘ scape from Turnus ’ hand ,</l>
     <l n="791">In vain the strongest of the Arcadian band :</l>
     <l n="792">Nor to Cupencus could his gods afford</l>
     <l n="793">Availing aid against the Ænean sword ,</l>
     <l n="794">Which to his naked heart pursued the course ;</l>
     <l n="795">Nor could his plated shield sustain the force .</l>
     <l n="796">Iölas fell , whom not the Grecian powers ,</l>
     <l n="797">Nor great subverter of the Trojan towers ,</l>
     <l n="798">Were doomed to kill , while heaven prolonged his date :</l>
     <l n="799">But who can pass the bounds prefixed by Fate ?</l>
     <l n="800">In high Lyrnessus , and in Troy , he held</l>
     <l n="801">Two palaces , and was from each expelled :</l>
     <l n="802">Of all the mighty man , the last remains</l>
     <l n="803">A little spot of foreign earth contains .</l>
     <l n="804">And now both hosts their broken troops unite</l>
     <l n="805">In equal ranks , and mix in mortal fight .</l>
     <l n="806">Serestus and undaunted Mnestheus join</l>
     <l n="807">The Trojan , Tuscan , and Arcadian line :</l>
     <l n="808">Sea-born Messapus , with Atinas , heads</l>
     <l n="809">The Latin squadrons , and to battle leads .</l>
     <l n="810">They strike , they push , they throng the scanty space , }</l>
     <l n="811">Resolved on death , impatient of disgrace ; }</l>
     <l n="812">And , where one falls , another fills his place . }</l>
     <l n="813">The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son</l>
     <l n="814">To leave the unfinished fight , and storm the town :</l>
     <l n="815">For , while he rolls his eyes around the plain</l>
     <l n="816">In quest of Turnus , whom he seeks in vain ,</l>
     <l n="817">He views the unguarded city from afar ,</l>
     <l n="818">In careless quiet , and secure of war .</l>
     <l n="819">Occasion offers , and excites his mind</l>
     <l n="820">To dare beyond the task he first designed .</l>
     <l n="821">Resolved , he calls his chiefs : they leave the fight :</l>
     <l n="822">Attended thus , he takes a neighbouring height :</l>
     <l n="823">The crowding troops about their general stand ,</l>
     <l n="824">All under arms , and wait his high command .</l>
     <l n="825">Then thus the lofty prince :— “ Hear and obey ,</l>
     <l n="826">Ye Trojan bands , without the least delay .</l>
     <l n="827">Jove is with us ; and what I have decreed ,</l>
     <l n="828">Requires our utmost vigour , and our speed .</l>
     <l n="829">Your instant arms against the town prepare ,</l>
     <l n="830">The source of mischief , and the seat of war .</l>
     <l n="831">This day the Latian towers , that mate the sky ,</l>
     <l n="832">Shall , level with the plain , in ashes lie :</l>
     <l n="833">The people shall be slaves , unless in time</l>
     <l n="834">They kneel for pardon , and repent their crime .</l>
     <l n="835">Twice have our foes been vanquished on the plain :</l>
     <l n="836">Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain ?</l>
     <l n="837">Your force against the perjured city bend ;</l>
     <l n="838">There it began , and there the war shall end ;</l>
     <l n="839">The peace profaned our rightful arms requires ;</l>
     <l n="840">Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires . ”</l>
     <l n="841">He finished ; and — one soul inspiring all —</l>
     <l n="842">Formed in a wedge , the foot approach the wall .</l>
     <l n="843">Without the town , an unprovided train</l>
     <l n="844">Of gaping gazing citizens are slain .</l>
     <l n="845">Some firebrands , others scaling ladders , bear ,</l>
     <l n="846">And those they toss aloft , and these they rear :</l>
     <l n="847">The flames now launched , the feathered arrows fly ,</l>
     <l n="848">And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky .</l>
     <l n="849">Advancing to the front , the hero stands ,</l>
     <l n="850">And , stretching out to heaven his pious hands ,</l>
     <l n="851">Attests the gods , asserts his innocence ,</l>
     <l n="852">Upbraids with breach of faith the Ausonian prince ;</l>
     <l n="853">Declares the royal honour doubly stained ,</l>
     <l n="854">And twice the rites of holy peace profaned .</l>
     <l n="855">Dissenting clamours in the town arise :</l>
     <l n="856">Each will be heard , and all at once advise .</l>
     <l n="857">One part for peace , and one for war , contends :</l>
     <l n="858">Some would exclude their foes , and some admit their friends .</l>
     <l n="859">The helpless king is hurried in the throng ,</l>
     <l n="860">And ( whate'er tide prevails ) is borne along .</l>
     <l n="861">Thus , when the swain , within a hollow rock ,</l>
     <l n="862">Invades the bees with suffocating smoke ,</l>
     <l n="863">They run around , or labour on their wings ,</l>
     <l n="864">Disused to flight , and shoot their sleepy stings ;</l>
     <l n="865">To shun the bitter fumes , in vain they try ;</l>
     <l n="866">Black vapours , issuing from the vent , involve the sky .</l>
     <l n="867">But Fate and envious Fortune now prepare</l>
     <l n="868">To plunge the Latins in the last despair .</l>
     <l n="869">The queen , who saw the foes invade the town ,</l>
     <l n="870">And brands on tops of burning houses thrown ,</l>
     <l n="871">Cast round her eyes , distracted with her fear :—</l>
     <l n="872">No troops of Turnus in the field appear .</l>
     <l n="873">Once more she stares abroad , but still in vain ,</l>
     <l n="874">And then concludes the royal youth is slain .</l>
     <l n="875">Mad with her anguish , impotent to bear</l>
     <l n="876">The mighty grief , she loaths the vital air .</l>
     <l n="877">She calls herself the cause of all this ill ,</l>
     <l n="878">And owns the dire effects of her ungoverned will :</l>
     <l n="879">She raves against the gods ; she beats her breast ;</l>
     <l n="880">She tears with both her hands her purple vest :</l>
     <l n="881">Then round a beam a running noose she tied ,</l>
     <l n="882">And , fastened by the neck , obscenely died .</l>
     <l n="883">Soon as the fatal news by fame was blown ,</l>
     <l n="884">And to her dames and to her daughter known ,</l>
     <l n="885">The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair , }</l>
     <l n="886">And rosy cheeks : the rest her sorrow share : }</l>
     <l n="887">With shrieks the palace rings , and madness of despair . }</l>
     <l n="888">The spreading rumour fills the public place : }</l>
     <l n="889">Confusion , fear , distraction , and disgrace , }</l>
     <l n="890">And silent shame , are seen in every face . }</l>
     <l n="891">Latinus tears his garments as he goes ,</l>
     <l n="892">Both for his public and his private woes ;</l>
     <l n="893">With filth his venerable beard besmears ,</l>
     <l n="894">And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs .</l>
     <l n="895">And much he blames the softness of his mind , }</l>
     <l n="896">Obnoxious to the charms of woman-kind , }</l>
     <l n="897">And soon reduced to change what he so well designed — }</l>
     <l n="898">To break the solemn league so long desired ,</l>
     <l n="899">Nor finish what his fates , and those of Troy , required .</l>
     <l n="900">Now Turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains ,</l>
     <l n="901">And here and there some straggling foes he gleans .</l>
     <l n="902">His flying coursers please him less and less ,</l>
     <l n="903">Ashamed of easy fight , and cheap success .</l>
     <l n="904">Thus half-contented , anxious in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="905">The distant cries come driving in the wind —</l>
     <l n="906">Shouts from the walls , but shouts in murmurs drowned ;</l>
     <l n="907">A jarring mixture , and a boding sound .</l>
     <l n="908">“ Alas ! ” said he , “ what mean these dismal cries ?</l>
     <l n="909">What doleful clamours from the town arise ? ”</l>
     <l n="910">Confused , he stops , and backward pulls the reins .</l>
     <l n="911">She , who the drivers office now sustains ,</l>
     <l n="912">Replies :— “ Neglect , my lord , these new alarms :</l>
     <l n="913">Here fight , and urge the fortune of your arms :</l>
     <l n="914">There want not others to defend the wall .</l>
     <l n="915">If by your rival 's hand the Italians fall ,</l>
     <l n="916">So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress ,</l>
     <l n="917">In honour equal , equal in success . ”</l>
     <l n="918">To this , the prince :— “ O sister !— for I knew ,</l>
     <l n="919">The peace infringed proceeded first from you :</l>
     <l n="920">I knew you , when you mingled first in fight :</l>
     <l n="921">And now in vain you would deceive my sight —</l>
     <l n="922">Why , goddess , this unprofitable care ?</l>
     <l n="923">Who sent you down from heaven , involved in air ,</l>
     <l n="924">Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain ,</l>
     <l n="925">And see your brother bleeding on the plain ?</l>
     <l n="926">For to what power can Turnus have recourse ,</l>
     <l n="927">Or how resist his fate 's prevailing force ?</l>
     <l n="928">These eyes beheld Murrhanus bite the ground —</l>
     <l n="929">Mighty the man , and mighty was the wound .</l>
     <l n="930">I heard my dearest friend , with dying breath ,</l>
     <l n="931">My name invoking to revenge his death .</l>
     <l n="932">Brave Ufens fell with honour on the place ,</l>
     <l n="933">To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace .</l>
     <l n="934">On earth supine , a manly corpse he lies ;</l>
     <l n="935">His vest and armour are the victor 's prize .</l>
     <l n="936">Then , shall I see Laurentum in a flame ,</l>
     <l n="937">Which only wanted , to complete my shame ?</l>
     <l n="938">How will the Latins hoot their champion 's flight !</l>
     <l n="939">How Drances will insult and point them to the sight !</l>
     <l n="940">Is death so hard to bear ?— Ye gods below !</l>
     <l n="941">( Since those above so small compassion show ,)</l>
     <l n="942">Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame ,</l>
     <l n="943">Which not belies my great forefathers ’ name . ”</l>
     <l n="944">He said : and while he spoke , with flying speed</l>
     <l n="945">Came Saces urging on his foamy steed :</l>
     <l n="946">Fixed on his wounded face a shaft he bore ,</l>
     <l n="947">And , seeking Turnus , sent his voice before :</l>
     <l n="948">“ Turnus ! on you , on you alone , depends</l>
     <l n="949">Our last relief :— compassionate your friends !</l>
     <l n="950">Like lightning , fierce Æneas , rolling on ,</l>
     <l n="951">With arms invests , with flames invades , the town :</l>
     <l n="952">The brands are tossed on high ; the winds conspire</l>
     <l n="953">To drive along the deluge of the fire .</l>
     <l n="954">All eyes are fixed on you : your foes rejoice ;</l>
     <l n="955">Even the king staggers , and suspends his choice —</l>
     <l n="956">Doubts to deliver or defend the town ,</l>
     <l n="957">Whom to reject , or whom to call his son .</l>
     <l n="958">The queen , on whom your utmost hopes were placed ,</l>
     <l n="959">Herself suborning death , has breathed her last .</l>
     <l n="960">‘ Tis true , Messapus , fearless of his fate ,</l>
     <l n="961">With fierce Atinas ’ aid , defends the gate :</l>
     <l n="962">On every side surrounded by the foe , }</l>
     <l n="963">The more they kill , the greater numbers grow ; }</l>
     <l n="964">An iron harvest mounts , and still remains to mow . }</l>
     <l n="965">You , far aloof from your forsaken bands ,</l>
     <l n="966">Your rolling chariot drive o'er empty sands . ”</l>
     <l n="967">Stupid he sate , his eyes on earth declined ,</l>
     <l n="968">And various cares revolving in his mind :</l>
     <l n="969">Rage , boiling from the bottom of his breast ,</l>
     <l n="970">And sorrow mixed with shame , his soul oppressed ;</l>
     <l n="971">And conscious worth lay labouring in his thought ,</l>
     <l n="972">And love by jealousy to madness wrought .</l>
     <l n="973">By slow degrees his reason drove away</l>
     <l n="974">The mists of passion , and resumed her sway .</l>
     <l n="975">Then , rising on his car , he turned his look ,</l>
     <l n="976">And saw the town involved in fire and smoke .</l>
     <l n="977">A wooden tower with flames already blazed ,</l>
     <l n="978">Which his own hands on beams and rafters raised ,</l>
     <l n="979">And bridges laid above to join the space ,</l>
     <l n="980">And wheels below to roll from place to place .</l>
     <l n="981">“ Sister ! the Fates have vanquished : let us go</l>
     <l n="982">The way which heaven and my hard fortune show .</l>
     <l n="983">The fight is fixed ; nor shall the branded name</l>
     <l n="984">Of a base coward blot your brother 's fame .</l>
     <l n="985">Death is my choice ; but suffer me to try</l>
     <l n="986">My force , and vent my rage before I die . ”</l>
     <l n="987">He said : and leaping down without delay ,</l>
     <l n="988">Through crowds of scattered foes he freed his way .</l>
     <l n="989">Striding he passed , impetuous as the wind ,</l>
     <l n="990">And left the grieving goddess far behind .</l>
     <l n="991">As , when a fragment , from a mountain torn</l>
     <l n="992">By raging tempests , or by torrents borne ,</l>
     <l n="993">Or sapped by time , or loosened from the roots —</l>
     <l n="994">Prone through the void the rocky ruin shoots ,</l>
     <l n="995">Rolling from crag to crag , from steep to steep ;</l>
     <l n="996">Down sink , at once , the shepherds and their sheep :</l>
     <l n="997">Involved alike , they rush to nether ground ;</l>
     <l n="998">Stunned with the shock they fall , and stunned from earth rebound :</l>
     <l n="999">So Turnus , hasting headlong to the town ,</l>
     <l n="1000">Shouldering and shoving , bore the squadrons down .</l>
     <l n="1001">Still pressing onward , to the walls he drew , }</l>
     <l n="1002">Where shafts and spears and darts promiscuous flew , }</l>
     <l n="1003">And sanguine streams the slippery ground embrue . }</l>
     <l n="1004">First stretching out his arm , in sign of peace ,</l>
     <l n="1005">He cries aloud , to make the combat cease :—</l>
     <l n="1006">“ Rutulians , hold ! and Latin troops , retire !</l>
     <l n="1007">The fight is mine ; and me the gods require .</l>
     <l n="1008">‘ Tis just that I should vindicate alone</l>
     <l n="1009">The broken truce , or for the breach atone .</l>
     <l n="1010">This day shall free from wars the Ausonian state ,</l>
     <l n="1011">Or finish my misfortunes in my fate . ”</l>
     <l n="1012">Both armies from their bloody work desist ,</l>
     <l n="1013">And , bearing backward , form a spacious list .</l>
     <l n="1014">The Trojan hero , who received from fame</l>
     <l n="1015">The welcome sound , and heard the champion 's name ,</l>
     <l n="1016">Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls :</l>
     <l n="1017">Greedy of war where greater glory calls ,</l>
     <l n="1018">He springs to fight , exulting in his force ;</l>
     <l n="1019">His jointed armour rattles in the course .</l>
     <l n="1020">Like Eryx , or like Athos , great he shows ,</l>
     <l n="1021">Or father Apennine , when , white with snows ,</l>
     <l n="1022">His head divine obscure in clouds he hides ,</l>
     <l n="1023">And shakes the sounding forest on his sides .</l>
     <l n="1024">The nations , overawed , surcease the fight ;</l>
     <l n="1025">Immoveable their bodies , fixed their sight .</l>
     <l n="1026">Even death stands still ; nor from above they throw</l>
     <l n="1027">Their darts , nor drive their battering-rams below .</l>
     <l n="1028">In silent order either army stands ,</l>
     <l n="1029">And drop their swords , unknowing , from their hands .</l>
     <l n="1030">The Ausonian king beholds , with wondering sight ,</l>
     <l n="1031">Two mighty champions matched in single fight ,</l>
     <l n="1032">Born under climes remote , and brought by fate ,</l>
     <l n="1033">With swords to try their titles to the state .</l>
     <l n="1034">Now , in closed field , each other from afar</l>
     <l n="1035">They view ; and , rushing on , begin the war .</l>
     <l n="1036">They launch their spears ; then hand to hand they meet ,</l>
     <l n="1037">The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet :</l>
     <l n="1038">Their bucklers clash ; thick blows descend from high ,</l>
     <l n="1039">And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly .</l>
     <l n="1040">Courage conspires with chance ; and both engage</l>
     <l n="1041">With equal fortune yet , and mutual rage .</l>
     <l n="1042">As , when two bulls for their fair female fight</l>
     <l n="1043">In Sila 's shades , or on Taburnus ’ height ,</l>
     <l n="1044">With horns adverse they meet ; the keeper flies ;</l>
     <l n="1045">Mute stands the herd ; the heifers roll their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1046">And wait the event — which victor they shall bear ,</l>
     <l n="1047">And who shall be the lord , to rule the lusty year :</l>
     <l n="1048">With rage of love the jealous rivals burn ,</l>
     <l n="1049">And push for push , and wound for wound , return ;</l>
     <l n="1050">Their dewlaps gored , their sides are laved in blood ;</l>
     <l n="1051">Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow through the wood :</l>
     <l n="1052">Such was the combat in the listed ground ;</l>
     <l n="1053">So clash their swords , and so their shields resound .</l>
     <l n="1054">Jove sets the beam : in either scale he lays</l>
     <l n="1055">The champions ’ fate , and each exactly weighs .</l>
     <l n="1056">On this side , life , and lucky chance ascends ;</l>
     <l n="1057">Loaded with death , that other scale descends .</l>
     <l n="1058">Raised on the stretch , young Turnus aims a blow</l>
     <l n="1059">Full on the helm of his unguarded foe :</l>
     <l n="1060">Shrill shouts and clamours ring on either side ,</l>
     <l n="1061">As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide .</l>
     <l n="1062">But all in pieces flies the traitor sword ,</l>
     <l n="1063">And , in the middle stroke , deserts his lord .</l>
     <l n="1064">Now ‘ tis but death or flight : disarmed he flies ,</l>
     <l n="1065">When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies .</l>
     <l n="1066">Fame says that Turnus , when his steeds he joined , }</l>
     <l n="1067">Hurrying to war , disordered in his mind , }</l>
     <l n="1068">Snatched the first weapon which his haste could find . }</l>
     <l n="1069">‘ Twas not the fated sword his father bore ,</l>
     <l n="1070">But that his charioteer Metiscus wore .</l>
     <l n="1071">This , while the Trojans fled , the toughness held :</l>
     <l n="1072">But , vain against the great Vulcanian shield ,</l>
     <l n="1073">The mortal-tempered steel deceived his hand :</l>
     <l n="1074">The shivered fragments shone amid the sand .</l>
     <l n="1075">Surprised with fear , he fled along the field ,</l>
     <l n="1076">And now forthright , and now in orbits wheeled :</l>
     <l n="1077">For here the Trojan troops the list surround ,</l>
     <l n="1078">And there the pass is closed with pools and marshy ground .</l>
     <l n="1079">Æneas hastens , though with heavier pace —</l>
     <l n="1080">His wound , so newly knit , retards the chase ,</l>
     <l n="1081">And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse —</l>
     <l n="1082">Yet , pressing foot by foot , his foe pursues .</l>
     <l n="1083">Thus , when a fearful stag is closed around</l>
     <l n="1084">With crimson toils , or in a river found ,</l>
     <l n="1085">High on the bank the deep-mouthed hound appears ,</l>
     <l n="1086">Still opening , following still , where'er he steers ;</l>
     <l n="1087">The persecuted creature , to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="1088">Turns here and there , to ‘ scape his Umbrian foe :</l>
     <l n="1089">Steep is the ascent , and , if he gains the land ,</l>
     <l n="1090">The purple death is pitched along the strand :</l>
     <l n="1091">His eager foe , determined to the chase ,</l>
     <l n="1092">Stretched at his length , gains ground at every pace :</l>
     <l n="1093">Now to his beamy head he makes his way ,</l>
     <l n="1094">And now he holds , or thinks he holds , his prey :</l>
     <l n="1095">Just at the pinch , the stag springs out with fear ;</l>
     <l n="1096">He bites the wind , and fills his sounding jaws with air :</l>
     <l n="1097">The rocks , the lakes , the meadows , ring with cries ;</l>
     <l n="1098">The mortal tumult mounts , and thunders in the skies .</l>
     <l n="1099">Thus flies the Daunian prince , and , flying , blames</l>
     <l n="1100">His tardy troops , and calling by their names ,</l>
     <l n="1101">Demands his trusty sword . The Trojan threats</l>
     <l n="1102">The realm with ruin , and their ancient seats</l>
     <l n="1103">To lay in ashes , if they dare supply ,</l>
     <l n="1104">With arms or aid , his vanquished enemy ;</l>
     <l n="1105">Thus menacing , he still pursues the course ,</l>
     <l n="1106">With vigour , though diminished of his force .</l>
     <l n="1107">Ten times already , round the listed place ,</l>
     <l n="1108">One chief had fled , and t'other given the chase :</l>
     <l n="1109">No trivial prize is played ; for on the life</l>
     <l n="1110">Or death of Turnus , now depends the strife .</l>
     <l n="1111">Within the space , an olive-tree had stood , }</l>
     <l n="1112">A sacred shade , a venerable wood , }</l>
     <l n="1113">For vows to Faunus paid , the Latins ’ guardian god . }</l>
     <l n="1114">Here hung the vests , and tablets were engraved ,</l>
     <l n="1115">Of sinking mariners from shipwreck saved .</l>
     <l n="1116">With heedless hands the Trojans felled the tree ,</l>
     <l n="1117">To make the ground inclosed for combat free .</l>
     <l n="1118">Deep in the root , whether by fate , or chance ,</l>
     <l n="1119">Or erring haste , the Trojan drove his lance ;</l>
     <l n="1120">Then stooped , and tugged with force immense , to free</l>
     <l n="1121">The encumbered spear from the tenacious tree ;</l>
     <l n="1122">That , whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain ,</l>
     <l n="1123">His flying weapon might from far attain .</l>
     <l n="1124">Confused with fear , bereft of human aid ,</l>
     <l n="1125">Then Turnus to the gods , and first to Faunus , prayed :—</l>
     <l n="1126">“ O Faunus ! pity ! and thou , mother Earth ,</l>
     <l n="1127">Where I thy foster-son received my birth ,</l>
     <l n="1128">Hold fast the steel ! If my religious hand</l>
     <l n="1129">Your plant has honoured , which your foes profaned ,</l>
     <l n="1130">Propitious hear my pious prayer ! ” He said ,</l>
     <l n="1131">Nor with successless vows invoked their aid .</l>
     <l n="1132">The incumbent hero wrenched , and pulled , and strained ;</l>
     <l n="1133">But still the stubborn earth the steel detained .</l>
     <l n="1134">Juturna took her time ; and , while in vain</l>
     <l n="1135">He strove , assumed Metiscus ’ form again ,</l>
     <l n="1136">And , in that imitated shape , restored</l>
     <l n="1137">To the despairing prince his Daunian sword .</l>
     <l n="1138">The queen of love — who , with disdain and grief ,</l>
     <l n="1139">Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief —</l>
     <l n="1140">To assert her offspring with a greater deed ,</l>
     <l n="1141">From the tough root the lingering weapon freed .</l>
     <l n="1142">Once more erect , the rival chiefs advance : }</l>
     <l n="1143">One trusts the sword , and one the pointed lance ; }</l>
     <l n="1144">And both resolved alike , to try their fatal chance . }</l>
     <l n="1145">Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke ,</l>
     <l n="1146">Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock :—</l>
     <l n="1147">“ What new arrest , O queen of heaven ! is sent</l>
     <l n="1148">To stop the Fates now labouring in the event ?</l>
     <l n="1149">What further hopes are left thee to pursue ? }</l>
     <l n="1150">Divine Æneas , ( and thou know'st it too ,) }</l>
     <l n="1151">Fore-doomed , to these celestial seats is due . }</l>
     <l n="1152">What more attempts for Turnus can be made ,</l>
     <l n="1153">That thus thou lingerest in this lonely shade ?</l>
     <l n="1154">Is it becoming of the due respect</l>
     <l n="1155">And awful honour of a god elect ,</l>
     <l n="1156">A wound unworthy of our state to feel ,</l>
     <l n="1157">Patient of human hands , and earthly steel ?</l>
     <l n="1158">Or seems it just , the sister should restore }</l>
     <l n="1159">A second sword , when one was lost before , }</l>
     <l n="1160">And arm a conquered wretch against his conqueror ? }</l>
     <l n="1161">For what , without thy knowledge and avow ,</l>
     <l n="1162">Nay more , thy dictate , durst Juturna do ?</l>
     <l n="1163">At last , in deference to my love , forbear</l>
     <l n="1164">To lodge within thy soul this anxious care :</l>
     <l n="1165">Reclined upon my breast , thy grief unload :—</l>
     <l n="1166">Who should relieve the goddess , but the god ?</l>
     <l n="1167">Now all things to their utmost issue tend ,</l>
     <l n="1168">Pushed by the Fates to their appointed end .</l>
     <l n="1169">While leave was given thee , and a lawful hour</l>
     <l n="1170">For vengeance , wrath , and unresisted power ,</l>
     <l n="1171">Tossed on the seas thou could'st thy foes distress ,</l>
     <l n="1172">And , driven ashore , with hostile arms oppress ;</l>
     <l n="1173">Deform the royal house ; and , from the side</l>
     <l n="1174">Of the just bridegroom , tear the plighted bride :—</l>
     <l n="1175">Now cease at my command . ” The Thunderer said ;</l>
     <l n="1176">And , with dejected eyes , this answer Juno made :—</l>
     <l n="1177">“ Because your dread decree too well I knew ,</l>
     <l n="1178">From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew .</l>
     <l n="1179">Else should you not behold me here , alone ,</l>
     <l n="1180">Involved in empty clouds , my friends bemoan ,</l>
     <l n="1181">But , girt with vengeful flames , in open sight ,</l>
     <l n="1182">Engaged against my foes in mortal fight .</l>
     <l n="1183">‘ Tis true , Juturna mingled in the strife</l>
     <l n="1184">By my command , to save her brother 's life ,</l>
     <l n="1185">At least to try ; but ( by the Stygian lake —</l>
     <l n="1186">The most religious oath the gods can take )</l>
     <l n="1187">With this restriction , not to bend the bow ,</l>
     <l n="1188">Or toss the spear , or trembling dart to throw .</l>
     <l n="1189">And now , resigned to your superior might ,</l>
     <l n="1190">And tired with fruitless toils , I loath the fight .</l>
     <l n="1191">This let me beg ( and this no fates withstand )</l>
     <l n="1192">Both for myself and for your father 's land ,</l>
     <l n="1193">That , when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace ,</l>
     <l n="1194">( Which I , since you ordain , consent to bless ,)</l>
     <l n="1195">The laws of either nation be the same ;</l>
     <l n="1196">But let the Latins still retain their name ,</l>
     <l n="1197">Speak the same language which they spoke before ,</l>
     <l n="1198">Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore .</l>
     <l n="1199">Call them not Trojans : perish the renown</l>
     <l n="1200">And name of Troy , with that detested town .</l>
     <l n="1201">Latium be Latium still ; let Alba reign ,</l>
     <l n="1202">And Rome 's immortal majesty remain . ”</l>
     <l n="1203">Then thus the founder of mankind replies :—</l>
     <l n="1204">( Unruffled was his front , serene his eyes ,)</l>
     <l n="1205">“ Can Saturn 's issue , and heaven 's other heir ,</l>
     <l n="1206">Such endless anger in her bosom bear ?</l>
     <l n="1207">Be mistress , and your full desires obtain ;</l>
     <l n="1208">But quench the choler you foment in vain .</l>
     <l n="1209">From ancient blood , the Ausonian people , sprung ,</l>
     <l n="1210">Shall keep their name , their habit , and their tongue :</l>
     <l n="1211">The Trojans to their customs shall be tied . }</l>
     <l n="1212">I will , myself , their common rites provide . }</l>
     <l n="1213">The natives shall command , the foreigners subside . }</l>
     <l n="1214">All shall be Latium ; Troy without a name ;</l>
     <l n="1215">And her lost sons forget from whence they came .</l>
     <l n="1216">From blood so mixed , a pious race shall flow ,</l>
     <l n="1217">Equal to gods , excelling all below .</l>
     <l n="1218">No nation more respect to you shall pay ,</l>
     <l n="1219">Or greater offerings on your altars lay . ”</l>
     <l n="1220">Juno consents , well pleased that her desires</l>
     <l n="1221">Had found success , and from the cloud retires .</l>
     <l n="1222">The peace thus made , the Thunderer next prepares</l>
     <l n="1223">To force the watery goddess from the wars .</l>
     <l n="1224">Deep in the dismal regions void of light ,</l>
     <l n="1225">Three daughters , at a birth , were born to Night :[ 14 ]</l>
     <l n="1226">These their brown mother , brooding on her care , }</l>
     <l n="1227">Endued with windy wings to flit in air , }</l>
     <l n="1228">With serpents girt alike , and crowned with hissing hair . }</l>
     <l n="1229">In heaven the Diræ called , and still at hand ,</l>
     <l n="1230">Before the throne of angry Jove they stand ,</l>
     <l n="1231">His ministers of wrath , and ready still</l>
     <l n="1232">The minds of mortal men with fears to fill ,</l>
     <l n="1233">Whene'er the moody sire , to wreak his hate</l>
     <l n="1234">On realms or towns deserving of their fate ,</l>
     <l n="1235">Hurls down diseases , death , and deadly care ,</l>
     <l n="1236">And terrifies the guilty world with war .</l>
     <l n="1237">One sister plague of these from heaven he sent ,</l>
     <l n="1238">To fright Juturna with a dire portent .</l>
     <l n="1239">The pest comes whirling down : by far more slow</l>
     <l n="1240">Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow ,</l>
     <l n="1241">Or Cydon yew , when , traversing the skies ,</l>
     <l n="1242">And drenched in poisonous juice , the sure destruction flies .</l>
     <l n="1243">With such a sudden , and unseen a flight ,</l>
     <l n="1244">Shot through the clouds the daughter of the Night .</l>
     <l n="1245">Soon as the field inclosed she had in view ,</l>
     <l n="1246">And from afar her destined quarry knew —</l>
     <l n="1247">Contracted , to the boding bird she turns ,</l>
     <l n="1248">Which haunts the ruined piles and hallowed urns ,</l>
     <l n="1249">And beats about the tombs with nightly wings ,</l>
     <l n="1250">Where songs obscene on sepulchres she sings .</l>
     <l n="1251">Thus lessened in her form , with frightful cries }</l>
     <l n="1252">The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies , }</l>
     <l n="1253">Flaps on his shield , and flutters o'er his eyes . }</l>
     <l n="1254">A lazy chilness crept along his blood ;</l>
     <l n="1255">Choked was his voice ; his hair with horror stood .</l>
     <l n="1256">Juturna from afar beheld her fly ,</l>
     <l n="1257">And knew the ill omen , by her screaming cry ,</l>
     <l n="1258">And stridor of her wing . Amazed with fear ,</l>
     <l n="1259">Her beauteous breast she beat , and rent her flowing hair .</l>
     <l n="1260">“ Ah me ! ” she cries — “ in this unequal strife ,</l>
     <l n="1261">What can thy sister more to save thy life ?</l>
     <l n="1262">Weak as I am , can I , alas ! contend</l>
     <l n="1263">In arms with that inexorable fiend ?</l>
     <l n="1264">Now , now , I quit the field ! forbear to fright</l>
     <l n="1265">My tender soul , ye baleful birds of night !</l>
     <l n="1266">The lashing of your wings I know too well ,</l>
     <l n="1267">The sounding flight , and funeral screams of hell !</l>
     <l n="1268">These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove ,</l>
     <l n="1269">The worthy recompense of ravished love !</l>
     <l n="1270">Did he for this exempt my life from fate ?</l>
     <l n="1271">O hard conditions of immortal state !</l>
     <l n="1272">Though born to death , not privileged to die ,</l>
     <l n="1273">But forced to bear imposed eternity !</l>
     <l n="1274">Take back your envious bribes , and let me go</l>

     <l n="1279">To rest a weary goddess in the tomb ? ”</l>
     <l n="1280">She drew a length of sighs ; nor more she said ,</l>
     <l n="1281">But in her azure mantle wrapped her head ,</l>
     <l n="1282">Then plunged into her stream , with deep despair ,</l>
     <l n="1283">And her last sobs came bubbling up in air .</l>
     <l n="1284">Now stern Æneas waves his weighty spear</l>
     <l n="1285">Against his foe , and thus upbraids his fear :—</l>
     <l n="1286">“ What farther subterfuge can Turnus find ?</l>
     <l n="1287">What empty hopes are harboured in his mind ?</l>
     <l n="1288">‘ Tis not thy swiftness can secure thy flight ;</l>
     <l n="1289">Not with their feet , but hands , the valiant fight .</l>
     <l n="1290">Vary thy shape in thousand forms , and dare</l>
     <l n="1291">What skill and courage can attempt in war ;</l>
     <l n="1292">Wish for the wings of winds , to mount the sky ; }</l>
     <l n="1293">Or hid within the hollow earth to lie ! ” }</l>
     <l n="1294">The champion shook his head , and made this short reply :— }</l>
     <l n="1295">“ No threats of thine my manly mind can move ;</l>
     <l n="1296">Tis hostile heaven I dread , and partial Jove . ”</l>
     <l n="1297">He said no more , but , with a sigh , repressed</l>
     <l n="1298">The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast .</l>
     <l n="1299">Then , as he rolled his troubled eyes around , }</l>
     <l n="1300">An antique stone he saw , the common bound }</l>
     <l n="1301">Of neighbouring fields , and barrier of the ground — }</l>
     <l n="1302">So vast , that twelve strong men of modern days</l>
     <l n="1303">The enormous weight from earth could hardly raise .</l>
     <l n="1304">He heaved it at a lift , and , poised on high ,</l>
     <l n="1305">Ran staggering on against his enemy ,</l>
     <l n="1306">But so disordered , that he scarcely knew</l>
     <l n="1307">His way , or what unwieldy weight he threw .</l>
     <l n="1308">His knocking knees are bent beneath the load ,</l>
     <l n="1309">And shivering cold congeals his vital blood .</l>
     <l n="1310">The stone drops from his arms , and , falling short</l>
     <l n="1311">For want of vigour , mocks his vain effort .</l>
     <l n="1312">And as , when heavy sleep has closed the sight ,</l>
     <l n="1313">The sickly fancy labours in the night ;</l>
     <l n="1314">We seem to run ; and , destitute of force ,</l>
     <l n="1315">Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course :</l>
     <l n="1316">In vain we heave for breath ; in vain we cry ; }</l>
     <l n="1317">The nerves , unbraced , their usual strength deny ; }</l>
     <l n="1318">And on the tongue the faltering accents die ; }</l>
     <l n="1319">So Turnus fared ; whatever means he tried , }</l>
     <l n="1320">All force of arms , and points of art employed , }</l>
     <l n="1321">The Fury flew athwart , and made the endeavour void . }</l>
     <l n="1322">A thousand various thoughts his soul confound ; }</l>
     <l n="1323">He stared about , nor aid nor issue found ; }</l>
     <l n="1324">His own men stop the pass , and his own walls surround . }</l>
     <l n="1325">Once more he pauses , and looks out again ,</l>
     <l n="1326">And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain .</l>
     <l n="1327">Trembling he views the thundering chief advance ,</l>
     <l n="1328">And brandishing aloft the deadly lance :</l>
     <l n="1329">Amazed he cowers beneath his conquering foe ,</l>
     <l n="1330">Forgets to ward , and waits the coming blow .</l>
     <l n="1331">Astonished while he stands , and fixed with fear ,</l>
     <l n="1332">Aimed at his shield he sees the impending spear .</l>
     <l n="1333">The hero measured first , with narrow view , }</l>
     <l n="1334">The destined mark ; and , rising as he threw , }</l>
     <l n="1335">With its full swing the fatal weapon flew . }</l>
     <l n="1336">Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls ,</l>
     <l n="1337">Or stones from battering-engines break the walls :</l>
     <l n="1338">Swift as a whirlwind , from an arm so strong ,</l>
     <l n="1339">The lance drove on , and bore the death along .</l>
     <l n="1340">Nought could his sevenfold shield the prince avail ,</l>
     <l n="1341">Nor aught , beneath his arms , the coat of mail :</l>
     <l n="1342">It pierced through all , and with a grisly wound</l>
     <l n="1343">Transfixed his thigh , and doubled him to ground .</l>
     <l n="1344">With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky :</l>
     <l n="1345">Woods , hills , and valleys , to the voice reply .</l>
     <l n="1346">Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid , }</l>
     <l n="1347">With eyes cast upwards , and with arms displayed , }</l>
     <l n="1348">And , recreant , thus to the proud victor prayed :— }</l>
     <l n="1349">“ I know my death deserved , nor hope to live :</l>
     <l n="1350">Use what the gods and thy good fortune give .</l>
     <l n="1351">Yet think , oh ! think , if mercy may be shown ,</l>
     <l n="1352">( Thou hadst a father once , and hast a son ,)</l>
     <l n="1353">Pity my sire , now sinking to the grave ;</l>
     <l n="1354">And , for Anchises ’ sake , old Daunus save !</l>
     <l n="1355">Or , if thy vowed revenge pursue my death ,</l>
     <l n="1356">Give to my friends my body void of breath !</l>
     <l n="1357">The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life : }</l>
     <l n="1358">Thine is the conquest , thine the royal wife : }</l>
     <l n="1359">Against a yielded man , ‘ tis mean ignoble strife . ” }</l>
     <l n="1360">In deep suspense the Trojan seemed to stand ,</l>
     <l n="1361">And , just prepared to strike , repressed his hand .</l>
     <l n="1362">He rolled his eyes , and every moment felt</l>
     <l n="1363">His manly soul with more compassion melt ;</l>
     <l n="1364">When , casting down a casual glance , he spied</l>
     <l n="1365">The golden belt that glittered on his side ,</l>
     <l n="1366">The fatal spoil which haughty Turnus tore</l>
     <l n="1367">From dying Pallas , and in triumph wore .</l>
     <l n="1368">Then , roused anew to wrath , he loudly cries ,</l>
     <l n="1369">( Flames , while he spoke , came flashing from his eyes )</l>
     <l n="1370">“ Traitor ! dost thou , dost thou to grace pretend ,</l>
     <l n="1371">Clad , as thou art , in trophies of my friend ?</l>
     <l n="1372">To his sad soul a grateful offering go !</l>
     <l n="1373">‘ Tis Pallas , Pallas gives this deadly blow . ”</l>
     <l n="1374">He raised his arm aloft , and , at the word ,</l>
     <l n="1375">Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword .</l>
     <l n="1376">The streaming blood distained his arms around ,</l>
     <l n="1377">And the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Amata , ever partial to the cause of Turnus , had just before desired him , with all manner of earnestness , not to engage his rival in single fight ; which was his present resolution . Virgil , though ( in favour of his hero ) he never tells us directly that Lavinia preferred Turnus to Æneas , yet has insinuated this preference twice before . For mark , in the seventh Æneïd , she left her father , ( who had promised her to Æneas without asking her consent ,) and followed her mother into the woods , with a troop of Bacchanals , where Amata sung the marriage-song , in the name of Turnus ; which , if she had disliked , she might have opposed . Then , in the eleventh Æneïd , when her mother went to the temple of Pallas , to invoke her aid against Æneas , whom she calls by no better name than Phrygius prædo , Lavinia sits by her in the same chair or litter , juxtaque comes Lavinia virgo ,— oculos dejecta decoros . What greater sign of love , than fear and concernment for the lover ? In the lines which I have quoted , she not only sheds tears , but changes colour . She had been bred up with Turnus ; and Æneas was wholly a stranger to her . Turnus , in probability , was her first love , and favoured by her mother , who had the ascendant over her father . But I am much deceived , if ( besides what I have said ) there be not a secret satire against the sex , which is lurking under this description of Virgil , who seldom speaks well of women — better indeed of Camilla , than any other — for he commends her beauty and valour — because he would concern the reader for her death . But valour is no very proper praise for woman-kind ; and beauty is common to the sex . He says also somewhat of Andromache , but transiently : and his Venus is a better mother than a wife ; for she owns to Vulcan she had a son by another man . The rest are Junos , Dianas , Didos , Amatas , two mad prophetesses , three Harpies on earth , and as many Furies under ground . This fable of Lavinia includes a secret moral ; that women , in their choice of husbands , prefer the younger of their suitors to the elder ; are insensible of merit , fond of handsomeness , and , generally speaking , rather hurried away by their appetite , than governed by their reason .</p>

     <l n="1">Sea-born Messapus , with Atinas , heads</l>
     <l n="2">The Latin squadrons , and to battle leads .— P . 166 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poet had said , in the preceding lines , that Mnestheus , Serestus , and Asylas , led on the Trojans , the Tuscans , and the Arcadians : but none of the printed copies , which I have seen , mention any leader of the Rutulians and Latins , but Messapus the son of Neptune . Ruæus takes notice of this passage , and seems to wonder at it ; but gives no reason , why Messapus is alone without a coadjutor .</p>
   <p>The four verses of Virgil run thus :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Totæ adeo conversæ acies , omnesque Latini ,</l>
     <l n="2">Omnes Dardanidæ ; Mnestheus , ucerque Serestus ,</l>
     <l n="3">Et Messapus equûm domitor , et fortis Asylas ,</l>
     <l n="4">Tuscorumque phalanx , Evandrique Arcades alæ .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I doubt not but the third line was originally thus :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Et Messapus equûm domitor , et fortis Atinas :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>for the two names of Asylas and Atinas are so like , that one might easily be mistaken for the other by the transcribers . And to fortify this opinion , we find afterward , in the relation of Saces to Turnus , that Atinas is joined with Messapus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Soli , pro portis , Messapus et acer Atinas</l>
     <l n="2">Sustentant aciem ——</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In general I observe , not only in this Æneïd , but in all the six last Books , that Æneas is never seen on horseback , and but once before , as I remember , in the fourth , where he hunts with Dido . The reason of this , if I guess aright , was a secret compliment which the poet made to his countrymen the Romans , the strength of whose armies consisted most in foot , which , I think , were all Romans and Italians . But their wings or squadrons were made up of their allies , who were foreigners .</p>

     <l n="3">The words in the original are these :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">Pro Latio obtestor , pro majestate tuorum .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Virgil very artfully uses here the word majestas , which the Romans loved so well , that they appropriated it to themselves — Majestas populi Romani . This title , applied to kings , is very modern ; and that is all I will say of it at present , though the word requires a larger note . In the word tuorum , is included the sense of my translation , Your father 's land , because Saturn , the father of Jove , had governed that part of Italy , after his expulsion from Crete . But that on which I most insist , is the address of the poet , in this speech of Juno . Virgil was sufficiently sensible , as I have said in the preface , that whatever the common opinion was , concerning the descent of the Romans from the Trojans , yet the ancient customs , rites , laws , and habits of those Trojans were wholly lost , and perhaps also that they had never been : and , for this reason , he introduces Juno in this place , requesting of Jupiter that no memory might remain of Troy ( the town she hated ) , that the people hereafter should not be called Trojans , nor retain any thing which belonged to their predecessors . And why might not this also be concerted betwixt our author and his friend Horace , to hinder Augustus from re-building Troy , and removing thither the seat of empire , a design so unpleasing to the Romans ? But of this I am not positive , because I have not consulted Dacier , and the rest of the critics , to ascertain the time in which Horace writ the ode relating to that subject .</p>

     <l n="1">Deep in the dismal regions void of light ,</l>
     <l n="2">Three daughters , at a birth , were born to Night .— P . 177 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The father of these ( not here mentioned ) was Acheron : the names of the three were Alecto , Megæra , and Tisiphone . They were called Furies in hell , on earth Harpies , and in heaven Diræ . Two of these assisted at the throne of Jupiter , and were employed by him to punish the wickedness of mankind . These two must be Megæra and Tisiphone — not Alecto ; for Juno expressly commands her to return to hell , from whence she came ; and gives this reason :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Te super ætherias errare licentius auras</l>
     <l n="2">Haud pater ipse velit , summi regnator Olympi ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Probably this Dira , unnamed by the poet in this place , might be Tisiphone ; for , though we find her in hell , in the Sixth Æneïd , employed in the punishment of the damned ,</p>
   <lg>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>which I guess to be Tisiphone , the rather , by the etymology of her name , which is compounded of τιω ulciscor , and φονος cœdes ; part of her errand being to affright Turnus with the stings of a guilty conscience , and denounce vengeance against him for breaking the first treaty , by refusing to yield Lavinia to Æneas , to whom she was promised by her father — and , consequently , for being the author of an unjust war ; and also for violating the second treaty , by declining the single combat , which he had stipulated with his rival , and called the gods to witness before their altars . As for the names of the Harpies , ( so called on earth ,) Hesiod tells us they were Iris , Aëllo , and Ocypete . Virgil calls one of them Celæno : this , I doubt not , was Alecto , whom Virgil calls , in the Third Æneïd , Furiarum maxima , and in the sixth again by the same name — Furiarum maxima juxta accubat . That she was the chief of the Furies , appears by her description in the Seventh Æneïd ; to which , for haste , I refer the reader .</p>

    <head>POSTSCRIPT</head>
    <head>TO</head>
    <head>THE READER .</head>
    <head>What Virgil wrote in the vigour of his age , in plenty and at ease , I have undertaken to translate in my declining years ; struggling with wants , oppressed with sickness , curbed in my genius , liable to be misconstrued in all I write ; and my judges , if they are not very equitable , already prejudiced against me , by the lying character which has been given them of my morals . Yet , steady to my principles , and not dispirited with my afflictions , I have , by the blessing of God on my endeavours , overcome all difficulties , and , in some measure , acquitted myself of the debt which I owed the public when I undertook this work . In the first place , therefore , I thankfully acknowledge to the Almighty Power the assistance he has given me in the beginning , the prosecution , and conclusion , of my present studies , which are more happily performed than I could have promised to myself , when I laboured under such discouragements . For , what I have done , imperfect as it is for want of health and leisure to correct it , will be judged in after-ages , and possibly in the present , to be no dishonour to my native country , whose language and poetry would be more esteemed abroad , if they were better understood . Somewhat ( give me leave to say ) I have added to both of them in the choice of words , and harmony of numbers , which were wanting ( especially the last ) in all our poets , even in those who , being endued with genius , yet have not cultivated their mother-tongue with sufficient care ; or , relying on the beauty of their thoughts , have judged the ornament of words , and sweetness of sound , unnecessary . One is for raking in Chaucer ( our English Ennius ) for antiquated words , which are never to be revived , but when sound or significancy is wanting in the present language . But many of his deserve not this redemption , any more than the crowds of men who daily die , or are slain for sixpence in a battle , merit to be restored to life , if a wish could revive them . Others have no ear for verse , nor choice of words , nor distinction of thoughts ; but mingle farthings with their gold , to make up the sum . Here is a field of satire opened to me : but , since the Revolution , I have wholly renounced that talent : for who would give physic to the great , when he is uncalled — to do his patient no good , and endanger himself for his prescription ? Neither am I ignorant , but I may justly be condemned for many of those faults , of which I have too liberally arraigned others .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>It is enough for me , if the government will let me pass unquestioned . In the mean time , I am obliged , in gratitude , to return my thanks to many of them , who have not only distinguished me from others of the same party , by a particular exception of grace , but , without considering the man , have been bountiful to the poet — have encouraged Virgil to speak such English as I could teach him , and rewarded his interpreter for the pains he has taken in bringing him over into Britain , by defraying the charges of his voyage . Even Cerberus , when he had received the sop , permitted Æneas to pass freely to Elysium . Had it been offered me , and I had refused it , yet still some gratitude is due to such who were willing to oblige me : but how much more to those from whom I have received the favours which they have offered to one of a different persuasion ! amongst whom I cannot omit naming the Earls of Derby<span corresp="#note15" type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>and of Peterborough<span corresp="#note16" type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>. To the first of these I have not the honour to be known ; and therefore his liberality was as much unexpected , as it was undeserved . The present Earl of Peterborough has been pleased long since to accept the tenders of my service : his favours are so frequent to me , that I receive them almost by prescription . No difference of interests or opinion has been able to withdraw his protection from me . And I might justly be condemned for the most unthankful of mankind , if I did not always preserve for him a most profound respect and inviolable gratitude . I must also add , that , if the last Æneïd shine amongst its fellows , it is owing to the commands of Sir William Trumball ,<span corresp="#note17" type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>one of the principal secretaries of state , who recommended it , as his favourite , to my care ; and , for his sake particularly , I have made it mine : for who would confess weariness , when he enjoined a fresh labour ? I could not but invoke the assistance of a Muse , for this last office .</p>

   <p>Neither am I to forget the noble present which was made me by Gilbert Dolben , Esq . the worthy son of the late Archbishop of York ,<span corresp="#note18" type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>who , when I began this work , enriched me with all the several editions of Virgil , and all the commentaries of those editions in Latin ; amongst which , I could not but prefer the Dauphin 's , as the last , the shortest , and the most judicious . Fabrini<span corresp="#note19" type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>I had also sent me from Italy ; but either he understands Virgil very imperfectly , or I have no knowledge of my author .</p>
   <p>Being invited by that worthy gentleman , Sir William Bowyer , to Denham Court , I translated the First Georgic at his house , and the greatest part of the last Æneïd .<span corresp="#note20" type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>A more friendly entertainment no man ever found . No wonder , therefore , if both those versions surpass the rest , and own the satisfaction I received in his converse , with whom I had the honour to be bred in Cambridge , and in the same college . The Seventh Æneïd was made English at Burleigh , the magnificent abode of the Earl of Exeter .<span corresp="#note21" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>In a village belonging to his family I was born ;<span corresp="#note22" type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>and under his roof I endeavoured to make that Æneïd appear in English with as much lustre as I could ; though my author has not given the finishing strokes either to it , or to the eleventh , as I perhaps could prove in both , if I durst presume to criticise my master .</p>
   <p>By a letter from William Walsh , of Abberley , Esq .<span corresp="#note23" type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>( who has so long honoured me with his friendship , and who , without flattery , is the best critic of our nation ,) I have been informed , that his grace the Duke of Shrewsbury<span corresp="#note24" type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>has procured a printed copy of the Pastorals , Georgics , and six first Æneïds , from my bookseller , and has read them in the country , together with my friend . This noble person having been pleased to give them a commendation , which I presume not to insert , has made me vain enough to boast of so great a favour , and to think I have succeeded beyond my hopes ; the character of his excellent judgment , the acuteness of his wit , and his general knowledge of good letters , being known as well to all the world , as the sweetness of his disposition , his humanity , his easiness of access , and desire of obliging those who stand in need of his protection , are known to all who have approached him , and to me in particular , who have formerly had the honour of his conversation . Whoever has given the world the translation of part of the Third Georgic , which he calls “ The Power of Love , ” has put me to sufficient pains to make my own not inferior to his ;<span corresp="#note25" type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>as my Lord Roscommon 's “ Silenus ” had formerly given me the same trouble . The most ingenious Mr Addison of Oxford has also been as troublesome to me as the other two , and on the same account . After his “ Bees , ” my latter swarm is scarcely worth the hiving .<span corresp="#note26" type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>Mr Cowley 's “ Praise of a Country Life ” is excellent , but is rather an imitation of Virgil , than a version . That I have recovered , in some measure , the health which I had lost by too much application to this work , is owing , next to God 's mercy , to the skill and care of Dr Guibbons<span corresp="#note27" type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>and Dr Hobbs ,<span corresp="#note28" type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>the two ornaments of their profession , whom I can only pay by this acknowledgment . The whole faculty has always been ready to oblige me ; and the only one of them , who endeavoured to defame me , had it not in his power .<span corresp="#note29" type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>I desire pardon from my readers for saying so much in relation to myself , which concerns not them ; and , with my acknowledgments to all my subscribers , have only to add , that the few Notes which follow , are par manière d'acquit , because I had obliged myself by articles to do somewhat of that kind .<span corresp="#note30" type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>These scattering observations are rather guesses at my author 's meaning in some passages , than proofs that so he meant . The unlearned may have recourse to any poetical dictionary in English , for the names of persons , places , or fables , which the learned need not : but that little which I say , is either new or necessary ; and the first of these qualifications never fails to invite a reader , if not to please him .</p>

   <note xml:id="note16" place="bottom" n="16">Charles Mordaunt , third earl of Peterborough , and first earl of Monmouth of his family , is one of the most heroic characters , according to ancient ideas of heroism , which occur in English history . Under every disadvantage of want of money , and provisions , and men , from England , of the united opposition of France , and almost all Spain , and of the untoward and untractable disposition of Charles of Austria , he had almost placed that prince upon the Spanish throne , in defiance of all opposition , as well as of Charles 's own imprudence . With an army , which never amounted to 10 , 000 men , he drove triple the number out of Spain before him ; and , had he not been removed by a wretched intrigue , he would have secured the kingdom , which he had effectually conquered . Like other heroes , he was attached to literature , and especially to poetry ; and the conqueror of Spain was the patron of Dryden , and the friend of Swift , Pope , and Gay . He was a keen Whig , but not in favour with his party . “ It is a perfect jest , ” says Swift , in a letter to Archbishop King , 5th February , 1707-8 , “ to see my Lord Peterborough , reputed as great a Whig as any man in England , abhorred by his own party , and caressed by the Tories . ” This great man died at Lisbon , 1737 , aged seventy-seven .</note>
   <note xml:id="note17" place="bottom" n="17">The name of Sir William Trumball is eminent among those statesmen , who , amidst the fatigues of state , have found leisure to cultivate the Muses . He had been ambassador to France and Constantinople ; and , in 1695 , was raised to the high situation mentioned in the text . In 1697 , he resigned his employments , and retired to East Hamstead , in Berkshire , where he early distinguished the youthful genius of Pope . During the remaining years of Sir William 's life , the young bard and the old statesman were almost inseparable companions .</note>
   <note xml:id="note18" place="bottom" n="18">Gilbert was the eldest son of John Dolben , Archbishop of York ; a man distinguished for bravery in the civil wars , and for dignity of conduct in his episcopal station . Sir William Trumball wrote a character of him , which is inserted in the new edition of the Biographia , Vol . V. p. 330 . The archbishop is celebrated by Dryden , as a friend of David , in the first part of “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” See Vol . IX . p. 243 , 303 . Of Gilbert Dolben 's life , the munificence extended to Dryden is perhaps the most memorable incident .</note>

Prior was early patronised by his lordship ; and dates from his mansion the lively epistle to Fleetwood Shepherd . Mr Malone supposes Prior may have assisted in composing his epitaph , where his character is thus elegantly drawn : Johannes Cecil , Baro de Burghley , Exoniæ comes , magni Burleii abnepos haudquaquam degener . Egregiam enim indolem optimis moribus optimis artibus excoluit . Humanioribus literis bene instructus , peregre , plus vice simplici , profectus est . Et ab excultis Europæ regionibus , multam antiquitatum linguarum , necnon et rerum civilium scientiam reportavit . Cum nemo fortê meliùs vel aulam ornare , vel curare respublicas posset , maluit tamen otium et secessum . Itaque ruri suo vixit , eleganter , sumptuose , splendide , liberalibus studiis oblectatus , amicis comis et jocundus , egenis largus , legum et ecclesiæ Anglicanæ fortis semper propugnator .</note>

   <note xml:id="note24" place="bottom" n="24">Charles Talbot , the twelfth earl , and only duke of Shrewsbury . He was bred a Catholic ; but renounced the tenets of Rome during the time of the Popish plot . Previous to the Revolution , he had so strong a sense of the necessity of that measure , that he mortgaged his estate for 40 , 000l . and retired into Holland , for the purpose of offering his fealty , and sword , to the Prince of Orange . Accordingly , when that great enterprize succeeded , he was advanced to the ducal dignity , and loaded with office and honours . In 1700 , the Duke went upon the Continent for his health ; and , on his return , finding the Whigs disgusted at his having married a foreign lady , having visited Rome , and , above all , having declined to enter actively into their measures , he joined the Tories ; he assisted in bringing about the peace of Utrecht , being appointed ambassador extraordinary for that purpose ; and , finally , went to Ireland as lord-lieutenant . He died 1st February , 1717-18 .— Mackay , or Davis , gives him the following character .</note>
   <p>“ Never was a greater mixture of honour , virtue , [ none ] and good sense , in any one person , than in him . A great man , attended with a sweetness of behaviour and easiness of conversation , which charms all who come near him : Nothing of the stiffness of a statesman , yet the capacity and knowledge of a piercing wit . He speaks French and Italian as well as his native language : and , although but one eye , yet he has a very charming countenance , and is the most generally beloved by the ladies of any gentleman in his time . He is turned of forty years old . ”</p>
   <p>The little word none , within the crotchets , is inserted by Swift . That wit elsewhere describes the duke “ as a person of admirable qualities ; and , if he were somewhat more active , and less timorous in business , no man would be thought comparable to him . ” — Letter to Archbishop King , 20th May , 1712 . ]</p>

   <note xml:id="note30" place="bottom" n="30">A passage in a letter from our author to Jacob Tonson , dated probably February 1695-6 , lets us know yet more plainly , that to the niggard disposition of this bookseller , we owe that the notes , as here acknowledged , were rather slurred over , than written with due care : “ I am not sorry that you will not allow any thing towards the Notes ; for , to make them good , would have cost me half a year 's time at least . Those I write shall be only marginal , to help the unlearned , who understand not the poetical fables . The Prefaces , as I intend them , will be somewhat more learned . It would require seven years to translate Virgil exactly ; but , I promise you once more , to do my best in the four remaining Books , as I have hitherto done in the foregoing .— Upon trial , I find all of your trade are sharpers , and you not more than others ; therefore , I have not wholly left you . Mr Aston does not blame you for getting as good a bargain as you could , though I could have got a hundred pounds more ; and you might have spared almost all your trouble , if you had thought fit to publish the proposals for the first subscriptions , for I have guineas offered me every day , if there had been room ; I believe , modestly speaking , I have refused already twenty-five . I mislike nothing in your letter , therefore , but only your upbraiding me with the public encouragement , and my own reputation concerned in the notes ; when I assure you I could not make them to my mind in less than half a year 's time . ”</note>
   <p>POEMS</p>
   <p>ASCRIBED TO DRYDEN .</p>
   <p>In this last division of poetry , those poems are placed which have been ascribed to Dryden upon grounds more or less satisfactory , yet do not seem entitled to be classed with his acknowledged writings . To some of them he doubtless lent his assistance , either from friendship to the author , or to the cause in which they were written . But , even in these , the hand of Dryden is not so effectually distinguished from that of the inferior artist , as to entitle them to be removed from the apocryphal station which is here assigned . Others I would have discarded altogether , but from the consideration that they were not of great length , and that the first complete edition of Dryden should contain all that has hitherto been ascribed to our immortal Bard , even upon loose and uncertain grounds .</p>
   <p>AN ESSAY UPON SATIRE .</p>
   <p>Among the pieces fathered upon Dryden , without satisfactory reason , this contains as little internal evidence as any of having received even the touches of that great master . Yet , as is mentioned in the Life of our poet , the suspicion of being the author subjected him to the cowardly revenge of Rochester , who hired bravoes to beat Dryden , in return for the severity with which he is here treated . The versification is so harsh , and the satire so coarse and clumsy , that I can hardly consent to think that Dryden did more than revise and correct it . If he added a few lines here and there , he had so industriously levelled them with the rest of the performance , that they cannot be distinguished from it . The real author was Sheffield , Earl of Mulgrave , afterwards Duke of Buckingham .</p>
   <p>Like other lampoons of the time , the “ Essay on Satire ” was handed about in manuscript copies , about November 1679 . It is inserted in the quarto edition of Sheffield Duke of Buckingham 's Works , with many alterations and improvements by Pope , to whose correction it had been subjected by the noble poet . It is obvious , and has been well argued by Mr Malone , that if Dryden had taken any considerable pains with the original copy , Pope would have had but little to do .</p>
   <p>Sheffield , in his “ Essay on Poetry , ” pays our author a very supercilious and aristocratic compliment on this , his own poem , having been attributed to him , and the castigation which ensued :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Though praised and punished for another 's rhimes ,</l>
     <l n="2">His own deserve as much applause sometimes .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is thus that noble authors distribute their praise , like their bounty , duly seasoned with humbling admonition . In the copy of the Essay , revised by Pope , this impertinent couplet is omitted .</p>

    <head>AN</head>
    <head>ESSAY UPON SATIRE .</head>
     <l n="1">How dull , and how insensible a beast</l>
     <l n="2">Is man , who yet would lord it o'er the rest !</l>
     <l n="3">Philosophers and poets vainly strove</l>
     <l n="4">In every age the lumpish mass to move ;</l>
     <l n="5">But those were pedants , when compared with these ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who know , not only to instruct , but please .</l>
     <l n="7">Poets alone found the delightful way ,</l>
     <l n="8">Mysterious morals gently to convey</l>
     <l n="9">In charming numbers ; so that as men grew</l>
     <l n="10">Pleased with their poems , they grew wiser too .</l>
     <l n="11">Satire has always shone among the rest ;</l>
     <l n="12">And is the boldest way , if not the best ,</l>
     <l n="13">To tell men freely of their foulest faults ,</l>
     <l n="14">To laugh at their vain deeds , and vainer thoughts .<span corresp="#note31" type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span></l>
     <l n="15">In satire , too , the wise took different ways ,</l>
     <l n="16">To each deserving its peculiar praise .</l>
     <l n="17">Some did all folly with just sharpness blame ,</l>
     <l n="18">Whilst others laughed and scorned them into shame .</l>
     <l n="19">But of these two , the last succeeded best ,</l>
     <l n="20">As men aim rightest when they shoot in jest .</l>
     <l n="21">Yet , if we may presume to blame our guides ,</l>
     <l n="22">And censure those , who censure all besides ,</l>
     <l n="23">In other things they justly are preferred ;</l>
     <l n="24">In this alone methinks the ancients erred :</l>
     <l n="25">Against the grossest follies they declaim ;</l>
     <l n="26">Hard they pursue , but hunt ignoble game .</l>
     <l n="27">Nothing is easier than such blots to hit ,</l>
     <l n="28">And ‘ tis the talent of each vulgar wit :</l>
     <l n="29">Besides , ‘ tis labour lost ; for , who would preach</l>
     <l n="30">Morals to Armstrong ,<span corresp="#note32" type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>or dull Aston<span corresp="#note33" type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>teach ?</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Tis being devout at play , wise at a ball ,</l>
     <l n="32">Or bringing wit and friendship to Whitehall .</l>
     <l n="33">But with sharp eyes those nicer faults to find ,</l>
     <l n="34">Which lie obscurely in the wisest mind ,</l>
     <l n="35">That little speck which all the rest does spoil ,—</l>
     <l n="36">To wash off that would be a noble toil ;</l>
     <l n="37">Beyond the loose-writ libels of this age ,</l>
     <l n="38">Or the forced scenes of our declining stage ;</l>
     <l n="39">Above all censure too , each little wit</l>
     <l n="40">Will be so glad to see the greater hit ;</l>
     <l n="41">Who judging better , though concerned the most ,</l>
     <l n="42">Of such correction will have cause to boast .</l>
     <l n="43">In such a satire all would seek a share ,</l>
     <l n="44">And every fool will fancy he is there .</l>
     <l n="45">Old story-tellers , too , must pine and die ,</l>
     <l n="46">To see their antiquated wit laid by ;</l>
     <l n="47">Like her , who missed her name in a lampoon ,</l>
     <l n="48">And grieved to find herself decayed so soon .</l>
     <l n="49">No common coxcomb must be mentioned here ;</l>
     <l n="50">Not the dull train of dancing sparks appear ;</l>
     <l n="51">Nor fluttering officers , who never fight ;</l>
     <l n="52">Of such a wretched rabble , who would write ?</l>
     <l n="53">Much less half-wits ; that 's more against our rules ;</l>
     <l n="54">For they are fops , the other are but fools .</l>
     <l n="55">Who would not be as silly as Dunbar ?<span corresp="#note34" type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span></l>
     <l n="56">As dull as Monmouth ,<span corresp="#note35" type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>rather than Sir Carr ?<span corresp="#note36" type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span></l>
     <l n="57">The cunning courtier should be slighted too ,</l>
     <l n="58">Who with dull knavery makes so much ado ;</l>
     <l n="59">Till the shrewd fool , by thriving too too fast ,</l>
     <l n="60">Like Æsop 's fox , becomes a prey at last .</l>
     <l n="61">Nor shall the royal mistresses<span corresp="#note37" type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>be named ,</l>
     <l n="62">Too ugly , or too easy to be blamed ;</l>
     <l n="63">With whom each rhyming fool keeps such a pother ,</l>
     <l n="64">They are as common that way as the other ;</l>
     <l n="65">Yet , sauntering Charles , between his beastly brace , }</l>
     <l n="66">Meets with dissembling still in either place , }</l>
     <l n="67">Affected humour , or a painted face . }</l>
     <l n="68">In loyal libels we have often told him ,</l>
     <l n="69">How one has jilted him , the other sold him :</l>
     <l n="70">How that affects to laugh , how this to weep ;</l>
     <l n="71">But who can rail so long as he can sleep ?</l>
     <l n="72">Was ever prince by two at once misled ,</l>
     <l n="73">False , foolish , old , ill-natured , and ill-bred ?</l>

     <l n="76">At council set as foils on Dorset 's score ,</l>
     <l n="77">To make that great false jewel shine the more ;</l>
     <l n="78">Who all that while was thought exceeding wise ,</l>
     <l n="79">Only for taking pains , and telling lies .</l>
     <l n="80">But there 's no meddling with such nauseous men ;</l>
     <l n="81">Their very names have tired my lazy pen :</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Tis time to quit their company , and choose</l>
     <l n="83">Some fitter subject for a sharper muse .</l>
     <l n="84">First , let 's behold the merriest man alive<span corresp="#note41" type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span></l>
     <l n="85">Against his careless genius vainly strive ;</l>
     <l n="86">Quit his dear ease , some deep design to lay ,</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Gainst a set time , and then forget the day :</l>
     <l n="88">Yet he will laugh at his best friends , and be</l>
     <l n="89">Just as good company as Nokes and Lee .</l>
     <l n="90">But when he aims at reason or at rule ,</l>
     <l n="91">He turns himself the best to ridicule .</l>
     <l n="92">Let him at business ne'er so earnest sit ,</l>
     <l n="93">Shew him but mirth , and bait that mirth with wit ,</l>
     <l n="94">That shadow of a jest shall be enjoyed ,</l>
     <l n="95">Though he left all mankind to be destroyed .</l>
     <l n="96">So cat transformed sat gravely and demure ,</l>
     <l n="97">Till mouse appeared , and thought himself secure ;</l>
     <l n="98">But soon the lady had him in her eye ,</l>
     <l n="99">And from her friend did just as oddly fly .</l>
     <l n="100">Reaching above our nature does no good ;</l>
     <l n="101">We must fall back to our old flesh and blood ;</l>
     <l n="102">As by our little Machiavel we find ,</l>

     <l n="106">No pity of its poor companion takes . }</l>
     <l n="107">What gravity can hold from laughing out ,</l>
     <l n="108">To see him drag his feeble legs about ,</l>
     <l n="109">Like hounds ill-coupled ? Jowler lugs him still</l>
     <l n="110">Through hedges , ditches , and through all that 's ill .</l>
     <l n="111">‘ Twere crime in any man but him alone ,</l>
     <l n="112">To use a body so , though ‘ tis one 's own :</l>
     <l n="113">Yet this false comfort never gives him o'er ,</l>
     <l n="114">That , whilst he creeps , his vigorous thoughts can soar :</l>
     <l n="115">Alas ! that soaring to those few that know ,</l>
     <l n="116">Is but a busy grovelling here below .</l>
     <l n="117">So men in rapture think they mount the sky , }</l>

     <l n="123">Kind nature checks , and kinder fortune slights ;</l>

   <note xml:id="note37" place="bottom" n="37">The royal mistresses were , the Duchesses of Cleveland and of Portsmouth . Neither was supposed over-scrupulous in fidelity to their royal lover . The Duchess of Cleveland , in particular , lavished her favours even upon Jacob Hall , the rope-dancer ; at least , so Count Hamilton assures us , in the “ Memoirs of Grammont . ” The Duchess of Portsmouth was a pensioner of the French court ; by whom she was thrown into the arms of Charles , with the express purpose of securing his attachment to the cause of France . Charles knew , as well as any of his subjects , the infidelity of one mistress , and the treachery of the other ; and Sheffield has elsewhere vindicated the epithet of “ sauntering , ” which is here bestowed on that indolent monarch . “ I am of opinion , ” says the duke , “ that , in his latter times , there was as much of laziness as of love in all those hours he passed among his mistresses ; who , after all , only served to fill up his seraglio , while a bewitching kind of pleasure , called sauntering , and talking without constraint , was the true sultana-queen he delighted in . "[ 38 ] While Sheffield thus solemnly confirms , in prose , the character given of Charles in the “ Essay upon Satire , ” he ascertains his claim to the property of the poem . And I must add , I should be sorry to think Dryden was accessary to lampooning persons , to whom he had offered the incense of his verse .

He was son of that Lord Capel , who so gallantly defended Colchester during the civil wars , and was executed upon the place being taken . Lord Essex had been lieutenant of Ireland from 1672 to 1677 , and was supposed to have fixed his ambition upon returning to that situation . Being disappointed , he joined in the measures of Shaftesbury and Monmouth , and was a violent opponent of the court . He was committed to the Tower on account of his accession to the Rye-house plot ; and , upon the morning on which Lord Russel was conveyed to his trial , he was found with his throat cut , the King and Duke of York being in the Tower at the very time , to witness some experiment on the ordnance . It was afterwards asserted , that he had been murdered by order of the court . Even Burnet , however , seems to acquit them of the crime , both because Essex was a free-thinker , and accustomed to vindicate suicide , and because his surgeon declared to him , that , from the mode in which the wound was inflicted , it could only have been done with his own hand . But the violent proceedings against Braddon and Speke , who attempted to investigate this mysterious affair , threw some suspicion upon the court party . If Charles was accessary to the murder , the time was strangely chosen , and the king 's dissimulation equally remarkable ; for , on hearing the event , be exclaimed , “ Alas ! Lord Essex might have trusted my clemency , I owed his family a life . ”</note>

   <note xml:id="note53" place="bottom" n="53">No one could know the cowardice of Lord Rochester so well as Mulgrave , who , in his Memoirs , records the following infamous instance of it . He had heard it reported , that Lord Rochester had said something of him very malicious : “ I therefore sent Colonel Aston , a very mettled friend of mine , to call him to account for it . He denied the words ; and , indeed , I was soon convinced he had never said them : but the mere report , though I found it to be false , obliged me ( as I then foolishly thought ) to go on with the quarrel ; and the next day was appointed for us to fight on horseback , a way in England a little unusual , but it was his part to chuse . Accordingly , I and my second lay the night before at Knightsbridge , privately , to avoid the being secured at London upon any suspicion ; which yet we found ourselves more in danger of there , because we had all the appearance of highway-men , that had a mind to lie skulking in an odd inn for one night ; but this , I suppose , the people of that house were used to , and so took no notice of us , but liked us the better . In the morning , we met the Lord Rochester at the place appointed , who , instead of James Porter , whom , he assured Aston , he would make his second , brought an errant lifeguard-man , whom nobody knew . To this Mr Aston took exception , upon the account of his being no suitable adversary ; especially considering how extremely well he was mounted , whereas we had only a couple of pads . Upon which , we all agreed to fight on foot : But , as my Lord Rochester and I were riding into the next field , in order to it , he told me , that he had at first chosen to fight on horseback , because he was so weak with a distemper , that he found himself unfit to fight at all any way , much less a-foot . I was extremely surprised , because , at that time , no man had a better reputation for courage ; and ( my anger against him being quite over , because I was satisfied that he never spoke those words I resented ,) I took the liberty of representing , what a ridiculous story it would make if we returned without fighting ; and therefore advised him , for both our sakes , especially for his own , to consider better of it ; since I must be obliged , in my own defence , to lay the fault on him , by telling the truth of the matter . His answer was , that he submitted to it ; and hoped , that I would not desire the advantage of having to do with any man in so weak a condition . I replied , that , by such an argument , he had sufficiently tied my hands , upon condition I might call our seconds to be witnesses of the whole business ; which he consented to , and so we parted . When we returned to London , we found it full of this quarrel , upon our being absent so long ; and therefore Mr Aston thought himself obliged to write down every word and circumstance of this whole matter , in order to spread every where the true reason of our returning without having fought ; which being never in the least either contradicted or resented by the Lord Rochester , entirely ruined his reputation as to courage , ( of which I was really sorry to be the occasion ,) though no body had still a greater as to wit ; which supported him pretty well in the world , notwithstanding some more accidents of the same kind , that never fail to succeed one another when once people know a man 's weakness . ” — Memoirs of Sheffield , Duke of Buckingham .</note>
   <p>Conscious of his infamy , Rochester only ventured to reply to Sheffield , the real author of the above satire , by some cold sneers on his expedition to Tangiers , which occur in the poem called “ Rochester 's Farewell . ” ]</p>

    <head>FAMILIAR EPISTLE</head>
    <head>TO</head>
    <head>MR JULIAN ,</head>
    <head>SECRETARY OF THE MUSES .</head>
    <head>The extremity of license in manners , necessarily leads to equal license in personal satire ; and there never was an age in which both were carried to such excess as in that of Charles II . These personal and scandalous libels acquired the name of lampoons , from the established burden formerly sung to them :</head>
     <l n="1">Lampone , lampone , camerada lampone .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dryden suffered under these violent and invisible assaults , as much as any one of his age ; to which his own words , in several places of his writings , and also the existence of many of the pasquils themselves in the Luttrel Collection , bear ample witness . In many of his prologues and epilogues he alludes to this rage for personal satire , and to the employment which it found for the half and three quarter wits and courtiers of the time :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Yet these are pearls to your lampooning rhymes ;</l>
     <l n="2">Ye abuse yourselves more dully than the times .</l>
     <l n="3">Scandal , the glory of the English nation ,</l>
     <l n="4">Is worn to rags , and scribbled out of fashion :</l>
     <l n="5">Such harmless thrusts , as if , like fencers wise ,</l>
     <l n="6">They had agreed their play before their prize .</l>
     <l n="7">Faith they may hang their harp upon the willows ;</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis just like children when they box with pillows .</l>

   <p>Upon the general practice of writing lampoons , and the necessity of finding some mode of dispersing them , which should diffuse the scandal widely , while the authors remained concealed , was founded the self-erected office of Julian , secretary , as he called himself , to the Muses . This person attended Will 's , the Wits Coffeehouse , as it was called ; and dispersed , among the crowds who frequented that place of gay resort , copies of the lampoons which had been privately communicated to him by their authors . “ He is described , ” says Mr Malone , “ as a very drunken fellow , and at one time was confined for a libel . ” Several satires were written , in the form of addresses , to him , as well as the following . There is one among the State Poems , beginning ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Julian , in verse , to ease thy wants I write ,</l>
     <l n="2">Not moved by envy , malice , or by spite ,</l>
     <l n="3">Or pleased with the empty names of wit and sense ,</l>
     <l n="4">But merely to supply thy want of pence :</l>
     <l n="5">This did inspire my muse , when , out at eel ,</l>
     <l n="6">She saw her needy secretary reel .</l>
     <l n="7">Grieved that a man , so useful to the age ,</l>
     <l n="8">Should foot it in so mean an equipage ;</l>
     <l n="9">A crying scandal , that the fees of sense</l>
     <l n="10">Should not be able to support the expence</l>
     <l n="11">Of a poor scribe , who never thought of wants</l>
     <l n="12">When able to procure a cup of Nantz .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Another , called , “ A Consoling Epistle to Julian , ” is said to have been</l>
     <l n="14">written by the Duke of Buckingham .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>From a passage in one of the “ Letters from the Dead to the Living , ” we learn , that , after Julian 's death , and the madness of his successor , called Summerton , lampoon felt a sensible decay ; and there was no more that “ brisk spirit of verse , that used to watch the follies and vices of the men and women of figure , that they could not start new ones faster than lampoons exposed them . ”</p>
   <p>In another epistle of the same collection , supposed to be written by Julian from the shades , to Will Pierre , a low comedian , he is made thus to boast of the extent of the dominion which he exercised when on earth .</p>
   <p>“ The conscious Tub Tavern can witness , and my Berry Street apartment testify , the solicitations I have had , for the first copy of a new lampoon , from the greatest lords of the court , though their own folly and their wives ’ vices were the subjects . My person was so sacred , that the terrible scan-man had no terrors for me , whose business was so public and so useful , as conveying about the faults of the great and the fair ; for in my books , the lord was shewn a knave or fool , though his power defended the former , and his pride would not see the latter . The antiquated coquet was told of her age and ugliness , though her vanity placed her in the first row in the king 's box at the playhouse ; and in the view of the congregation at St James 's church . The precise countess , that would be scandalized at double entendre , was shown betwixt a pair of sheets with a well-made footman , in spite of her quality and conjugal vow . The formal statesman , that set up for wisdom and honesty , was exposed as a dull tool , and yet a knave , losing at play his own revenue , and the bribes incident to his post , besides enjoying the infamy of a poor and fruitless knavery without any concern . The demure lady , that would scarce sip off the glass in company , was shewn carousing her bottles in private , of cool Nantz too , sometimes , to correct the crudities of her last night 's debauch . In short , in my books were seen men and women as they were , not as they would seem ,— stript of their hypocrisy , spoiled of the fig-leaves of their quality . A knave was called a knave , a fool a fool , a jilt a jilt , and a whore a whore . And the love of scandal and native malice , that men and women have to one another , made me in such request when alive , that I was admitted to the lord 's closet , when a man of letters and merit would be thrust out of doors . And I was as familiar with the ladies as their lap-dogs : for to them I did often good services ; under pretence of a lampoon , I conveyed a billet doux ; and so , whilst I exposed their vast vices in the present , I prompted matter for the next lampoon . ”</p>
   <p>The following lampoon , in which it is highly improbable that Dryden had any share , is chiefly levelled against Sir Car Scrope , son of Sir Adrian Scrope of Cockington , in Lincolnshire , a courtier of considerable poetical talents , of whom Anthony Wood says , “ that , as divers satirical copies of verses were made upon him by other persons , so he hath diverse made by himself upon them , which are handed about to this day . ” We have seen that he is mentioned with contempt in the “ Essay on Satire ; ” and , in the “ Advice to Apollo , ” in the State Poems , Vol . I. his studies are thus commemorated :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Sir Car , that knight of withered face ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who , for the reversion of a poet 's place ,</l>
     <l n="3">Waits on Melpomene , and sooths her grace ;</l>
     <l n="4">That angry miss alone he strives to please ,</l>
     <l n="5">For fear the rest should teach him wit and ease ,</l>
     <l n="6">And make him quit his loved laborious walks ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where , sad or silent , o'er the room he stalks ,</l>
     <l n="8">And strives to write as wisely as he talks .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He is also mentioned in many other libels of the day , and some of his answers are still extant . Rochester assailed him in his “ Allusion to the Tenth Satire of Horace 's first Book . ” Sir Car Scrope replied , and published a poem in Defence of Satire , to which the earl retorted by a very coarse set of verses , addressed to the knight by name . Sir Car Scrope was a tolerable translator from the classics ; and his version of the “ Epistle from Sappho to Phaon ” is inserted in the translation of Ovid 's Epistles by several hands , edited by our author . Dryden mentions , in one of his prefaces , Sir Car Scrope 's efforts with approbation . But it is not from this circumstance alone I conclude that this epistle has been erroneously attributed to our author ; for the whole internal evidence speaks loudly against its authenticity . Indeed , it only rests on Dryden 's name being placed to it in the 6th volume of the Miscellanies published after his death .</p>

     <l n="45">Such is our charming Strephon 's outward man ,</l>
     <l n="46">His inward parts let those disclose who can .</l>
     <l n="47">One while he honoureth Birtha with his flame ,</l>
     <l n="48">And now he chants no less Lovisa 's<span corresp="#note58" type="note_anchor">[ 58 ]</span>name ;</l>
     <l n="49">For when his passion hath been bubbling long ,</l>
     <l n="50">The scum at last boils up into a song ;</l>
     <l n="51">And sure no mortal creature , at one time ,</l>
     <l n="52">Was e'er so far o'ergone with love and rhyme .</l>
     <l n="53">To his dear self of poetry he talks ,</l>
     <l n="54">His hands and feet are scanning as he walks ;</l>
     <l n="55">His writhing looks his pangs of wit accuse ,</l>
     <l n="56">The airy symptoms of a breeding muse ,</l>
     <l n="57">And all to gain the great Lovisa 's grace .</l>
     <l n="58">But never pen did pimp for such a face ;</l>
     <l n="59">There 's not a nymph in city , town , or court ,</l>
     <l n="60">But Strephon 's billet-doux has been their sport .</l>
     <l n="61">Still he loves on , yet still he 's sure to miss ,</l>
     <l n="62">As they who wash an Ethiop 's face , or his .</l>
     <l n="63">What fate unhappy Strephon does attend ,</l>
     <l n="64">Never to get a mistress , nor a friend !</l>
     <l n="65">Strephon alike both wits and fools detest ,</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Cause he 's like Esop 's bat , half bird half beast ;</l>
     <l n="67">For fools to poetry have no pretence ,</l>
     <l n="68">And common wit supposes common sense ;</l>
     <l n="69">Not quite so low as fool , nor quite a top ,</l>
     <l n="70">He hangs between them both , and is a fop .</l>
     <l n="71">His morals , like his wit , are motley too ;</l>
     <l n="72">He keeps from arrant knave with much ado .</l>
     <l n="73">But vanity and lying so prevail ,</l>
     <l n="74">That one grain more of each would turn the scale ;</l>
     <l n="75">He would be more a villain had he time ,</l>
     <l n="76">But he 's so wholly taken up with rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="77">That he mistakes his talent ; all his care</l>
     <l n="78">Is to be thought a poet fine and fair .</l>
     <l n="79">Small beer and gruel are his meat and drink ,</l>
     <l n="80">The diet he prescribes himself to think ;</l>
     <l n="81">Rhyme next his heart he takes at the morn peep ,</l>
     <l n="82">Some love epistles at the hour of sleep ;—</l>
     <l n="83">So , betwixt elegy and ode , we see</l>
     <l n="84">Strephon is in a course of poetry .</l>
     <l n="85">This is the man ordained to do thee good ,</l>
     <l n="86">The pelican to feed thee with his blood ;</l>
     <l n="87">Thy wit , thy poet , nay thy friend , for he</l>
     <l n="88">Is fit to be a friend to none but thee .</l>
     <l n="89">Make sure of him , and of his muse betimes ,</l>
     <l n="90">For all his study is hung round with rhymes .</l>
     <l n="91">Laugh at him , jostle him , yet still he writes ,</l>
     <l n="92">In rhyme he challenges , in rhyme he fights .</l>
     <l n="93">Charged with the last , and basest infamy ,</l>
     <l n="94">His business is to think what rhymes to lie ;</l>
     <l n="95">Which found , in fury he retorts again .</l>
     <l n="96">Strephon 's a very dragon at his pen ;</l>
     <l n="97">His brother murdered ,<span corresp="#note59" type="note_anchor">[ 59 ]</span>and his mother 's whored ,</l>
     <l n="98">His mistress lost , and yet his pen 's his sword .</l>

    <head>THE ART OF POETRY .</head>
     <l n="1">This piece was inserted among Dryden 's Works , upon authority of the</l>
     <l n="2">following advertisement by his publisher Jacob Tonson .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ This translation of Monsieur Boileau 's ‘ Art of Poetry ’ was made in the year 1680 , by Sir William Soame of Suffolk , Baronet ; who , being very intimately acquainted with Mr Dryden , desired his revisal of it . I saw the manuscript lie in Mr Dryden 's hands for above six months , who made very considerable alterations in it , particularly the beginning of the Fourth Canto ; and it being his opinion , that it would be better to apply the poem to English writers , than keep to the French names , as it was first translated , Sir William desired he would take the pains to make that alteration ; and accordingly that was entirely done by Mr Dryden .</p>
   <p>“ The poem was first published in the year 1683 . Sir William was after sent ambassador to Constantinople , in the reign of King James , but died in the voyage . ” — J. T .</p>
   <p>To give weight to Tonson 's authority , it may be added , that great part of the poem bears marks of Dryden 's polishing hand ; and that some entire passages show at once his taste in criticism , principles , and prejudices .</p>

     <l n="3">These points that by Italians first were prized ,</l>
     <l n="4">Our ancient authors knew not , or despised :</l>
     <l n="5">The vulgar dazzled with their glaring light ,</l>
     <l n="6">To their false pleasures quickly they invite ;</l>

     <l n="8">They overwhelmed Parnassus with their tide .</l>
     <l n="9">The Madrigal at first was overcome ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the proud Sonnet fell by the same doom ;</l>
     <l n="11">With these grave Tragedy adorned her flights ,</l>
     <l n="12">And mournful Elegy her funeral rites :</l>
     <l n="13">A hero never failed them on the stage ,</l>
     <l n="14">Without his point a lover durst not rage ;</l>
     <l n="15">The amorous shepherds took more care to prove</l>
     <l n="16">True to his point , than faithful to their love .</l>
     <l n="17">Each word , like Janus , had a double face ;</l>

     <l n="26">They turned upon the thought , and not the rhyme .</l>

     <l n="3">Protected humble goodness from reproach ,</l>
     <l n="4">Showed worth on foot , and rascals in the coach .</l>
     <l n="5">Horace his pleasing wit to this did add ,</l>
     <l n="6">And none uncensured could be fool or mad :</l>
     <l n="7">Unhappy was that wretch , whose name might be</l>
     <l n="8">Squared to the rules of their sharp poetry .</l>
     <l n="9">Persius obscure , but full of sense and wit ,</l>
     <l n="10">Affected brevity in all he writ ;</l>
     <l n="11">And Juvenal , learned as those times could be ,</l>
     <l n="12">Too far did stretch his sharp hyperbole ;</l>
     <l n="13">Though horrid truths through all his labours shine ,</l>
     <l n="14">In what he writes there 's something of divine ,</l>
     <l n="15">Whether he blames the Caprean debauch ,</l>
     <l n="16">Or of Sejanus ’ fall tells the approach ,</l>
     <l n="17">Or that he makes the trembling senate come</l>
     <l n="18">To the stern tyrant to receive their doom ;</l>
     <l n="19">Or Roman vice in coarsest habits shews ,</l>
     <l n="20">And paints an empress reeking from the stews :</l>
     <l n="21">In all he writes appears a noble fire ;</l>
     <l n="22">To follow such a master then desire .</l>
     <l n="23">Chaucer alone , fixed on this solid base ,</l>
     <l n="24">In his old style conserves a modern grace :</l>
     <l n="25">Too happy , if the freedom of his rhymes</l>
     <l n="26">Offended not the method of our times .</l>
     <l n="27">The Latin writers decency neglect ;</l>
     <l n="28">But modern authors challenge our respect ,</l>
     <l n="29">And at immodest writings take offence ,</l>
     <l n="30">If clean expression cover not the sense .</l>
     <l n="31">I love sharp Satire , from obsceneness free ;</l>
     <l n="32">Not impudence , that preaches modesty :</l>
     <l n="33">Our English , who in malice never fail ,</l>
     <l n="34">Hence in lampoons and libels learn to rail ;</l>
     <l n="35">Pleasant detraction , that by singing goes</l>
     <l n="36">From mouth to mouth , and as it marches grows :</l>
     <l n="37">Our freedom in our poetry we see ,</l>
     <l n="38">That child of joy begot by liberty .</l>
     <l n="39">But , vain blasphemer , tremble when you chuse</l>
     <l n="40">God for the subject of your impious muse :</l>
     <l n="41">At last , those jests which libertines invent ,</l>
     <l n="42">Bring the lewd author to just punishment .</l>
     <l n="43">Even in a song there must be art and sense ;</l>
     <l n="44">Yet sometimes we have seen that wine , or chance ,</l>
     <l n="45">Have warmed cold brains , and given dull writers mettle ,</l>
     <l n="46">And furnished out a scene for Mr Settle .</l>
     <l n="47">But for one lucky hit , that made thee please ,</l>
     <l n="48">Let not thy folly grow to a disease ,</l>
     <l n="49">Nor think thyself a wit ; for in our age</l>
     <l n="50">If a warm fancy does some fop engage ,</l>
     <l n="51">He neither eats nor sleeps till he has writ ,</l>
     <l n="52">But plagues the world with his adulterate wit .</l>
     <l n="53">Nay ‘ tis a wonder , if , in his dire rage ,</l>
     <l n="54">He prints not his dull follies for the stage ;</l>
     <l n="55">And in the front of all his senseless plays ,</l>
     <l n="56">Makes David Logan crown his head with bays .<span corresp="#note69" type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span></l>

    <head>TRAGEDY .</head>
     <l n="1">There 's not a monster bred beneath the sky ,</l>
     <l n="2">But well-disposed by art , may please the eye :</l>
     <l n="3">A curious workman by his skill divine ,</l>
     <l n="4">From an ill object makes a good design .</l>
     <l n="5">Thus to delight us , Tragedy , in tears</l>
     <l n="6">For Œdipus , provokes our hopes and fears ;</l>
     <l n="7">For parricide Orestes asks relief ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , to encrease our pleasure , causes grief .</l>
     <l n="9">You then that in this noble art would rise ,</l>
     <l n="10">Come , and in lofty verse dispute the prize .</l>
     <l n="11">Would you upon the stage acquire renown ,</l>
     <l n="12">And for your judges summon all the town ?</l>
     <l n="13">Would you your works for ever should remain ,</l>
     <l n="14">And after ages past be sought again ?</l>
     <l n="15">In all you write , observe with care and art</l>
     <l n="16">To move the passions , and incline the heart .</l>
     <l n="17">If in a laboured act , the pleasing rage</l>
     <l n="18">Cannot our hopes and fears by turns engage ,</l>
     <l n="19">Nor in our mind a feeling pity raise ,</l>
     <l n="20">In vain with learned scenes you fill your plays :</l>
     <l n="21">Your cold discourse can never move the mind</l>
     <l n="22">Of a stern critic , naturally unkind ,</l>
     <l n="23">Who , justly tired with your pedantic flight ,</l>
     <l n="24">Or falls asleep , or censures all you write .</l>
     <l n="25">The secret is , attention first to gain ;</l>
     <l n="26">To move our minds , and then to entertain ;</l>
     <l n="27">That from the very opening of the scenes ,</l>
     <l n="28">The first may show us what the author means .</l>
     <l n="29">I 'm tired to see an actor on the stage ,</l>
     <l n="30">That knows not whether he 's to laugh or rage ;</l>
     <l n="31">Who , an intrigue unravelling in vain ,</l>
     <l n="32">Instead of pleasing keeps my mind in pain .</l>
     <l n="33">I 'd rather much the nauseous dunce should say</l>
     <l n="34">Downright , my name is Hector in the play ;</l>
     <l n="35">Than with a mass of miracles , ill-joined ,</l>
     <l n="36">Confound my ears , and not instruct my mind .</l>
     <l n="37">The subject 's never soon enough exprest ;</l>
     <l n="38">Your place of action must be fixed , and rest .</l>
     <l n="39">A Spanish poet may with good event ,</l>
     <l n="40">In one day 's space whole ages represent ;</l>
     <l n="41">There oft the hero of a wandering stage</l>
     <l n="42">Begins a child , and ends the play of age :</l>
     <l n="43">But we , that are by reason 's rules confined ,</l>
     <l n="44">Will , that with art the poem be designed ;</l>
     <l n="45">That unity of action , time , and place ,</l>
     <l n="46">Keep the stage full , and all our labours grace .<span corresp="#note70" type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span></l>
     <l n="47">Write not what cannot be with ease conceived ;</l>
     <l n="48">Some truths may be too strong to be believed .</l>
     <l n="49">A foolish wonder cannot entertain ;</l>
     <l n="50">My mind 's not moved if your discourse be vain .</l>
     <l n="51">You may relate what would offend the eye :</l>
     <l n="52">Seeing , indeed , would better satisfy ;</l>
     <l n="53">But there are objects that a curious art</l>
     <l n="54">Hides from the eyes , yet offers to the heart .</l>
     <l n="55">The mind is most agreeably surprised ,</l>
     <l n="56">When a well-woven subject , long disguised ,</l>
     <l n="57">You on a sudden artfully unfold ,</l>
     <l n="58">And give the whole another face and mould .</l>
     <l n="59">At first the Tragedy was void of art ;</l>
     <l n="60">A song , where each man danced and sung his part ,</l>
     <l n="61">And of God Bacchus roaring out the praise ,</l>
     <l n="62">Sought a good vintage for their jolly days :</l>
     <l n="63">Then wine and joy were seen in each man 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="64">And a fat goat was the best singer 's prize .</l>
     <l n="65">Thespis was first , who , all besmeared with lee ,</l>
     <l n="66">Began this pleasure for posterity :</l>
     <l n="67">And with his carted actors , and a song ,</l>
     <l n="68">Amused the people as he passed along .</l>
     <l n="69">Next Æschylus the different persons placed ,</l>
     <l n="70">And with a better mask his players graced :</l>
     <l n="71">Upon a theatre his verse expressed ,</l>
     <l n="72">And showed his hero with a buskin dressed .</l>
     <l n="73">Then Sophocles , the genius of his age ,</l>
     <l n="74">Encreased the pomp and beauty of the stage ,</l>
     <l n="75">Engaged the chorus song in every part ,</l>
     <l n="76">And polished rugged verse by rules of art :</l>
     <l n="77">He in the Greek did those perfections gain ,</l>
     <l n="78">Which the weak Latin never could attain .</l>
     <l n="79">Our pious fathers , in their priest-rid age ,</l>
     <l n="80">As impious and prophane , abhorred the stage :</l>
     <l n="81">A troop of silly pilgrims , as ‘ tis said ,</l>
     <l n="82">Foolishly zealous , scandalously played ,</l>
     <l n="83">Instead of heroes , and of love 's complaints ,</l>
     <l n="84">The angels , God , the Virgin , and the saints .<span corresp="#note71" type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span></l>
     <l n="85">At last , right reason did his laws reveal ,</l>
     <l n="86">And showed the folly of their ill-placed zeal ,</l>
     <l n="87">Silenced those nonconformists of the age ,</l>
     <l n="88">And raised the lawful heroes of the stage :</l>
     <l n="89">Only the Athenian mask was laid aside ,</l>
     <l n="90">And chorus by the music was supplied .</l>
     <l n="91">Ingenious love , inventive in new arts ,</l>
     <l n="92">Mingled in plays , and quickly touched our hearts :</l>
     <l n="93">This passion never could resistance find ,</l>
     <l n="94">But knows the shortest passage to the mind .</l>
     <l n="95">Paint then , I 'm pleased my hero be in love ;</l>
     <l n="96">But let him not like a tame shepherd move ;</l>
     <l n="97">Let not Achilles be like Thyrsis seen ,</l>
     <l n="98">Or for a Cyrus show an Artamen ;<span corresp="#note72" type="note_anchor">[ 72 ]</span></l>
     <l n="99">That struggling oft , his passions we may find ,</l>
     <l n="100">The frailty , not the virtue of his mind .</l>
     <l n="101">Of romance heroes shun the low design ;</l>
     <l n="102">Yet to great hearts some human frailties join :</l>
     <l n="103">Achilles must with Homer 's heat engage ;</l>
     <l n="104">For an affront I 'm pleased to see him rage .</l>
     <l n="105">Those little failings in your hero 's heart</l>
     <l n="106">Show that of man and nature he has part .</l>
     <l n="107">To leave known rules you cannot be allowed ;</l>
     <l n="108">Make Agamemnon covetous and proud ,</l>
     <l n="109">Æneas in religious rites austere .</l>
     <l n="110">Keep to each man his proper character .</l>
     <l n="111">Of countries and of times the humours know ;</l>
     <l n="112">From different climates different customs grow :</l>
     <l n="113">And strive to shun their fault , who vainly dress</l>
     <l n="114">An antique hero like some modern ass ;</l>
     <l n="115">Who make old Romans like our English move ,</l>
     <l n="116">Show Cato sparkish , or make Brutus love .</l>
     <l n="117">In a romance those errors are excused :</l>
     <l n="118">There ‘ tis enough that , reading , we 're amused :</l>
     <l n="119">Rules too severe would there be useless found ;</l>
     <l n="120">But the strict scene must have a juster bound ;</l>
     <l n="121">Exact decorum we must always find .</l>
     <l n="122">If then you form some hero in your mind ,</l>
     <l n="123">Be sure your image with itself agree ;</l>
     <l n="124">For what he first appears , he still must be .</l>
     <l n="125">Affected wits will naturally incline</l>
     <l n="126">To paint their figures by their own design ;</l>
     <l n="127">Your bully poets , bully heroes write ; }</l>
     <l n="128">Chapman in Bussy D'Ambois<span corresp="#note73" type="note_anchor">[ 73 ]</span>took delight , }</l>
     <l n="129">And thought perfection was to huff and fight . }</l>
     <l n="130">Wise nature by variety does please ;</l>
     <l n="131">Clothe differing passions in a differing dress .</l>
     <l n="132">Bold anger , in rough haughty words appears ;</l>
     <l n="133">Sorrow is humble , and dissolves in tears .</l>
     <l n="134">Make not your Hecuba with fury rage ,</l>
     <l n="135">And show a ranting grief upon the stage ;</l>
     <l n="136">Or tell in vain how the rough Tanaïs bore</l>
     <l n="137">His sevenfold waters to the Euxine shore :</l>
     <l n="138">These swoln expressions , this affected noise ,</l>
     <l n="139">Shows like some pedant that declaims to boys .</l>
     <l n="140">In sorrow you must softer methods keep ;</l>
     <l n="141">And , to excite our tears , yourself must weep .</l>
     <l n="142">Those noisy words with which ill plays abound ,</l>
     <l n="143">Come not from hearts that are in sadness drowned .</l>
     <l n="144">The theatre for a young poet 's rhymes</l>
     <l n="145">Is a bold venture in our knowing times :</l>
     <l n="146">An author cannot easily purchase fame ;</l>
     <l n="147">Critics are always apt to hiss , and blame :</l>
     <l n="148">You may be judged by every ass in town ,</l>
     <l n="149">The privilege is bought for half-a-crown .</l>
     <l n="150">To please , you must a hundred changes try ;</l>
     <l n="151">Sometimes be humble , then must soar on high ;</l>
     <l n="152">In noble thoughts must everywhere abound ,</l>
     <l n="153">Be easy , pleasant , solid , and profound ;</l>
     <l n="154">To these you must surprising touches join ,</l>
     <l n="155">And show us a new wonder in each line ;</l>

     <l n="104">Placed on the sides , to see their armies pass ,</l>
     <l n="105">The fishes staring through the liquid glass ;</l>

     <l n="157">And boldly take the trumpet in their hand :</l>
     <l n="158">Their fustian muse each accident confounds ;</l>
     <l n="159">Nor can she fly , but rise by leaps and bounds ,</l>
     <l n="160">Till , their small stock of learning quickly spent ,</l>
     <l n="161">Their poem dies for want of nourishment .</l>
     <l n="162">In vain mankind the hot-brained fool decries ,</l>

     <l n="166">Virgil , compared to them , is flat and dry ;</l>

     <l n="180">Wisdom and virtue , honour , wit , and sense ,</l>
     <l n="181">Were subject to buffooning insolence :</l>
     <l n="182">Poets were publicly approved , and sought ,</l>
     <l n="183">That vice extolled , and virtue set at nought ;</l>
     <l n="184">A Socrates himself , in that loose age ,</l>
     <l n="185">Was made the pastime of a scoffing stage .</l>
     <l n="186">At last the public took in hand the cause ,</l>
     <l n="187">And cured this madness by the power of laws ;</l>
     <l n="188">Forbade at any time , or any place ,</l>
     <l n="189">To name the person , or describe the face .</l>
     <l n="190">The stage its ancient fury thus let fall ,</l>
     <l n="191">And comedy diverted without gall :</l>
     <l n="192">By mild reproofs recovered minds diseased ,</l>
     <l n="193">And , sparing persons , innocently pleased .</l>
     <l n="194">Each one was nicely shewn in this new glass ,</l>
     <l n="195">And smiled to think he was not meant the ass :</l>
     <l n="196">A miser oft would laugh at first , to find</l>
     <l n="197">A faithful draught of his own sordid mind ;</l>
     <l n="198">And fops were with such care and cunning writ ,</l>
     <l n="199">They liked the piece for which themselves did sit .</l>
     <l n="200">You , then , that would the comic laurels wear ,</l>
     <l n="201">To study nature be your only care .</l>
     <l n="202">Whoe'er knows man , and by a curious art</l>
     <l n="203">Discerns the hidden secrets of the heart ;</l>
     <l n="204">He who observes , and naturally can paint</l>
     <l n="205">The jealous fool , the fawning sycophant ,</l>
     <l n="206">A sober wit , an enterprising ass ,</l>
     <l n="207">A humorous Otter ,<span corresp="#note75" type="note_anchor">[ 75 ]</span>or a Hudibras ,—</l>
     <l n="208">May safely in those noble lists engage ,</l>
     <l n="209">And make them act and speak upon the stage .</l>
     <l n="210">Strive to be natural in all you write ,</l>
     <l n="211">And paint with colours that may please the sight .</l>
     <l n="212">Nature in various figures does abound ,</l>
     <l n="213">And in each mind are different humours found ;</l>
     <l n="214">A glance , a touch , discovers to the wise ,</l>
     <l n="215">But every man has not discerning eyes .</l>
     <l n="216">All-changing time does also change the mind ,</l>
     <l n="217">And different ages different pleasures find ;</l>
     <l n="218">Youth , hot and furious , cannot brook delay ,</l>
     <l n="219">By flattering vice is easily led away ;</l>
     <l n="220">Vain in discourse , inconstant in desire ,</l>
     <l n="221">In censure , rash ; in pleasures , all on fire .</l>
     <l n="222">The manly age does steadier thoughts enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="223">Power and ambition do his soul employ ;</l>
     <l n="224">Against the turns of fate he sets his mind ;</l>
     <l n="225">And by the past the future hopes to find .</l>
     <l n="226">Decrepit age , still adding to his stores ,</l>
     <l n="227">For others heaps the treasure he adores ;</l>
     <l n="228">In all his actions keeps a frozen pace ;</l>
     <l n="229">Past times extols , the present to debase :</l>
     <l n="230">Incapable of pleasures youth abuse ,</l>
     <l n="231">In others blames what age does him refuse .</l>
     <l n="232">Your actors must by reason be controuled ;</l>
     <l n="233">Let young men speak like young , old men like old .</l>
     <l n="234">Observe the town , and study well the court ;</l>
     <l n="235">For thither various characters resort .</l>
     <l n="236">Thus ‘ twas great Jonson purchased his renown ,</l>
     <l n="237">And in his art had borne away the crown ,</l>
     <l n="238">If , less desirous of the people 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="239">He had not with low farce debased his plays ;</l>
     <l n="240">Mixing dull buffoonry with wit refined ,</l>
     <l n="241">And Harlequin with noble Terence joined .</l>

     <l n="244">The comic wit , born with a smiling air ,</l>
     <l n="245">Must tragic grief and pompous verse forbear ;</l>
     <l n="246">Yet may he not , as on a market-place ,</l>
     <l n="247">With bawdy jests amuse the populace ;</l>
     <l n="248">With well-bred conversation you must please ,</l>

     <l n="250">Your action still should reason 's rules obey ,</l>
     <l n="251">Nor in an empty scene may lose its way .</l>
     <l n="252">Your humble style must sometimes gently rise ;</l>
     <l n="253">And your discourse sententious be , and wise :</l>
     <l n="254">The passions must to nature be confined ;</l>
     <l n="255">And scenes to scenes with artful weaving joined .</l>
     <l n="256">Your wit must not unseasonably play ;</l>
     <l n="257">But follow business , never lead the way .</l>
     <l n="258">Observe how Terence does this error shun :</l>
     <l n="259">A careful father chides his amorous son ;</l>
     <l n="260">Then see that son , whom no advice can move ,</l>
     <l n="261">Forget those orders , and pursue his love :</l>
     <l n="262">‘ Tis not a well-drawn picture we discover ;</l>
     <l n="263">‘ Tis a true son , a father , and a lover .</l>
     <l n="264">I like an author that reforms the age ,</l>
     <l n="265">And keeps the right decorum of the stage ;</l>
     <l n="266">That always pleases by just reason 's rule :</l>
     <l n="267">But for a tedious droll , a quibbling fool ,</l>
     <l n="268">Who with low nauseous bawdry fills his plays ,</l>
     <l n="269">Let him be gone , and on two tressels raise</l>
     <l n="270">Some Smithfield stage , where he may act his pranks ,</l>

     <head>CANTO IV .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="272">In Florence dwelt a doctor of renown ,</l>
      <l n="273">The scourge of God , and terror of the town ,</l>
      <l n="274">Who all the cant of physic had by heart ,</l>
      <l n="275">And never murdered but by rules of art .</l>
      <l n="276">The public mischief was his private gain :</l>
      <l n="277">Children their slaughtered parents sought in vain ;</l>
      <l n="278">A brother here his poisoned brother wept ;</l>
      <l n="279">Some bloodless died , and some by opium slept ;</l>
      <l n="280">Colds , at his presence , would to phrenzies turn ,</l>
      <l n="281">And agues , like malignant fevers , burn .</l>
      <l n="282">Hated , at last , his practice gives him o'er ;</l>
      <l n="283">One friend , unkilled by drugs , of all his store ,</l>
      <l n="284">In his new country-house affords him place ;</l>
      <l n="285">( ‘ Twas a rich abbot , and a building ass . )</l>
      <l n="286">Here first the doctor 's talent came in play ;</l>
      <l n="287">He seems inspired , and talks like Wren or May ;</l>
      <l n="288">Of this new portico condemns the face ,</l>
      <l n="289">And turns the entrance to a better place ;</l>
      <l n="290">Designs the stair-case at the other end :</l>
      <l n="291">His friend approves , does for his mason send .</l>
      <l n="292">He comes ; the doctor 's arguments prevail ;</l>
      <l n="293">In short , to finish this our humorous tale ,</l>
      <l n="294">He Galen 's dangerous science does reject ,</l>
      <l n="295">And from ill doctor turns good architect .</l>
      <l n="296">In this example we may have our part ;</l>
      <l n="297">Rather be mason , ( ‘ tis a useful art ,)</l>
      <l n="298">Than a dull poet ; for that trade accurst ,</l>
      <l n="299">Admits no mean betwixt the best and worst .</l>
      <l n="300">In other sciences , without disgrace ,</l>
      <l n="301">A candidate may fill a second place ;</l>
      <l n="302">But poetry no medium can admit ,</l>
      <l n="303">No reader suffers an indifferent wit :</l>
      <l n="304">The ruined stationers against him bawl ,</l>
      <l n="305">And Herringman<span corresp="#note77" type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span>degrades him from his stall .</l>
      <l n="306">Burlesque at least our laughter may excite ;</l>
      <l n="307">But a cold writer never can delight .</l>
      <l n="308">The Counter-scuffle<span corresp="#note78" type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>has more wit and art ,</l>
      <l n="309">Than the stiff formal style of Gondibert .</l>
      <l n="310">Be not affected with that empty praise</l>
      <l n="311">Which your vain flatterers will sometimes raise ;</l>
      <l n="312">And when you read , with ecstasy will say ,</l>
      <l n="313">“ The finished piece ! the admirable play ! ”</l>
      <l n="314">Which , when exposed to censure and to light ,</l>
      <l n="315">Cannot endure a critic 's piercing sight .</l>
      <l n="316">A hundred authors ’ fates have been foretold ,</l>
      <l n="317">And Shadwell 's works are printed , but not sold .</l>
      <l n="318">Hear all the world ; consider every thought ;</l>
      <l n="319">A fool by chance may stumble on a fault :</l>
      <l n="320">Yet , when Apollo does your muse inspire ,</l>
      <l n="321">Be not impatient to expose your fire ;</l>
      <l n="322">Nor imitate the Settles of our times ,</l>
      <l n="323">Those tuneful readers of their own dull rhymes ,</l>
      <l n="324">Who seize on all the acquaintance they can meet ,</l>
      <l n="325">And stop the passengers that walk the street :</l>
      <l n="326">There is no sanctuary you can chuse</l>
      <l n="327">For a defence from their pursuing muse .</l>
      <l n="328">I 've said before , be patient when they blame ;</l>
      <l n="329">To alter for the better is no shame .</l>
      <l n="330">Yet yield not to a fool 's impertinence ;</l>
      <l n="331">Sometimes conceited sceptics , void of sense ,</l>
      <l n="332">By their false taste condemn some finished part ,</l>
      <l n="333">And blame the noblest flights of wit and art .</l>
      <l n="334">In vain their fond opinions you deride ,</l>
      <l n="335">With their loved follies they are satisfied ;</l>
      <l n="336">And their weak judgment , void of sense and light ,</l>
      <l n="337">Thinks nothing can escape their feeble sight :</l>
      <l n="338">Their dangerous counsels do not cure , but wound ; }</l>
      <l n="339">To shun the storm they run your verse aground , }</l>
      <l n="340">And thinking to escape a rock , are drowned . }</l>
      <l n="341">Chuse a sure judge to censure what you write ,</l>
      <l n="342">Whose reason leads , and knowledge gives you light ,</l>
      <l n="343">Whose steady hand will prove your faithful guide ,</l>
      <l n="344">And touch the darling follies you would hide :</l>
      <l n="345">He , in your doubts , will carefully advise ,</l>
      <l n="346">And clear the mist before your feeble eyes .</l>
      <l n="347">‘ Tis he will tell you , to what noble height</l>
      <l n="348">A generous muse may sometimes take her flight ;</l>
      <l n="349">When too much fettered with the rules of art ,</l>
      <l n="350">May from her stricter bounds and limits part :</l>
      <l n="351">But such a perfect judge is hard to see ,</l>
      <l n="352">And every rhymer knows not poetry ;</l>
      <l n="353">Nay some there are for writing verse extolled ,</l>
      <l n="354">Who know not Lucan 's dross from Virgil 's gold .</l>
      <l n="355">Would you in this great art acquire renown ?</l>
      <l n="356">Authors , observe the rules I here lay down .</l>
      <l n="357">In prudent lessons every where abound ;</l>
      <l n="358">With pleasant join the useful and the sound :</l>
      <l n="359">A sober reader a vain tale will slight ;</l>
      <l n="360">He seeks as well instruction as delight .</l>
      <l n="361">Let all your thoughts to virtue be confined ,</l>
      <l n="362">Still offering nobler figures to our mind :</l>
      <l n="363">I like not those loose writers , who employ</l>
      <l n="364">Their guilty muse , good manners to destroy ;</l>
      <l n="365">Who with false colours still deceive our eyes ,</l>
      <l n="366">And show us vice dressed in a fair disguise .</l>
      <l n="367">Yet do I not their sullen muse approve ,</l>
      <l n="368">Who from all modest writings banish love ;</l>
      <l n="369">That stript the playhouse of its chief intrigue ,</l>
      <l n="370">And make a murderer of Roderigue :</l>
      <l n="371">The lightest love , if decently exprest ,</l>
      <l n="372">Will raise no vitious motions in our breast .</l>
      <l n="373">Dido in vain may weep , and ask relief ;</l>
      <l n="374">I blame her folly , whilst I share her grief .</l>
      <l n="375">A virtuous author , in his charming art ,</l>
      <l n="376">To please the sense needs not corrupt the heart :</l>
      <l n="377">His heat will never cause a guilty fire :</l>
      <l n="378">To follow virtue then be your desire .</l>
      <l n="379">In vain your art and vigour are exprest ;</l>
      <l n="380">The obscene expression shows the infected breast .</l>
      <l n="381">But , above all , base jealousies avoid ,</l>
      <l n="382">In which detracting poets are employed .</l>
      <l n="383">A noble wit dares liberally commend ,</l>
      <l n="384">And scorns to grudge at his deserving friend .</l>
      <l n="385">Base rivals , who true wit and merit hate ,</l>
      <l n="386">Caballing still against it with the great ,</l>
      <l n="387">Maliciously aspire to gain renown ,</l>
      <l n="388">By standing up , and pulling others down .</l>
      <l n="389">Never debase yourself by treacherous ways ,</l>
      <l n="390">Nor by such abject methods seek for praise :</l>
      <l n="391">Let not your only business be to write ;</l>
      <l n="392">Be virtuous , just , and in your friends delight .</l>
      <l n="393">‘ Tis not enough your poems be admired ;</l>

      <l n="435">With pleasure mortals did their wonders see ,</l>
      <l n="436">And sacrificed to their divinity ;</l>
      <l n="437">But want , at last , base flattery entertained ,</l>
      <l n="438">And old Parnassus with this vice was stained ;</l>
      <l n="439">Desire of gain dazzling the poets ’ eyes ,</l>
      <l n="440">Their works were filled with fulsome flatteries .</l>
      <l n="441">Thus needy wits a vile revenue made ,</l>
      <l n="442">And verse became a mercenary trade .</l>

Probably Dryden , if he filled up this name , was contented to speak at large , from a general recollection , that Thomas Randolph , the adopted son of Ben Jonson , had written pastorals .

Menestrier informs us , that these pilgrims travelled in troops , and stood in the public streets , where they recited their poems , with their staff in hand ; while their chaplets and cloaks , covered with shells and images of various colours , formed a picturesque exhibition , which at length excited the piety of the citizens to erect , occasionally , a stage on an extensive spot of ground . These spectacles served as the amusement and instruction of the people .

   <p>TARQUIN AND TULLIA .</p>
   <p>This piece , and that which immediately follows , bear no trace of Dryden 's hand . They have been attributed , by Mr Malone , with much probability , to Mr Mainwaring , a violent Jacobite . The satire is coarse and intemperate , without having that easy flow of verse , and felicity of expression , which always distinguishes the genuine productions of our author .</p>
   <p>The comparison of William and Mary with Tarquin and Tullia , was early insisted upon as a topic of reproach . It occurs in a letter concerning the coronation medal , which , as is well known , represented , on the reverse , the destruction of Phaeton . The letter-writer says , that “ one gentleman seeing the chariot , but not understanding the Latin inscription , and having heard the town talk of Tullia , who instigated her husband Tarquinius to kill her father Servius Tullius king of the Romans , that he might succeed him in the throne , and , as Livy says , caused her chariot to be driven over his mangled body , cried out , ‘ Is this Tullia 's chariot ? ’ This I say shocked me , and raised my anger against the contriver , who had chosen so ill an emblem , which , upon so superficial a view , brought such an odious history into men 's minds . ” SOMERS ’ Tracts , p. 333 .</p>

    <head>ON THE YOUNG STATESMEN .</head>
    <head>The following verses have been ascribed to Dryden upon slight authority , and contrary to internal evidence . They display a good deal of the turn of wit , and structure of verse , which may be observed in similar jeux d'esprit of Dorset , to whom I am tempted to ascribe them , though the name of Dryden may have been borrowed , to give them publicity .</head>
     <l n="1">They ought to have preceded , in point of time , those entitled “ Tarquin</l>
     <l n="2">and Tullia , ” but were accidentally misplaced .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As nicknames are easily perpetuated , I observe , that these verses entailed upon the young statesmen , the names of Chit Sunderland , Chit Lory , &amp; c. in the satires of the day . This administration came into office in the latter years of Charles II . ' s reign . The satire turns on a comparison between them and their predecessors of what was called the Cabal . There is a parody on these lines in the “ State Poems , ” in which they are applied to Stillingfleet .</p>

   <p>To these poems ascribed to Dryden , may be added the following ; which , however , have so little mark of his hand , that the Editor thinks it most proper to degrade them into a note . Indeed Dryden could not have written the first of these without being guilty of gross ingratitude , a fault which was entirely inconsistent with his character .</p>

   <p>This Essay contains the first detailed view of our author 's opinions concerning the Drama . In many things , particularly in the main point of preference given to rhyme , he afterwards saw cause to retract some of the principles here laid down . We have endeavoured elsewhere to trace the progress and alteration of Dryden 's sentiments upon these subjects .<span corresp="#note94" type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>But the reader 's attention may be here called to the elegant form into which he has thrown his Essay , and which has been so often in vain followed by clumsy imitators . The scene of the dialogue , and the striking incident by which it is introduced , have the happiest effect in arresting the attention ; and infinite address is displayed in conducting the subject , from the distant noise of a bloody sea-fight , into the academic prolusions of dramatic criticism .</p>
   <p>The speakers in the dialogue are four ; three of whom are persons “ whom their wit and quality have made known to all the town . ” The fourth , of whose properties the author speaks more modestly , is NEANDER , under which feigned appellation Dryden himself is figured . In corroboration of this , Mr Malone produces two instances , in which Dryden is called Neander by the famous Corinna , or Eliza Thomas .<span corresp="#note95" type="note_anchor">[ 95 ]</span>Moreover , the curious reader must be informed , that there is an anagram in the name of the second personage , LISIDEIUS , which points him out to be Sir Charles Sedley , or Sidley , for his name was spelled both ways .<span corresp="#note96" type="note_anchor">[ 96 ]</span>CRITES , the advocate for blank verse , is Sir Robert Howard , our author 's friend and brother-in-law ; who , in the preface to his plays , published in 1665 , had censured rhiming tragedies as unnatural . Prior has assured us , that EUGENIUS means the witty Earl of Dorset , then Lord Buckhurst .<span corresp="#note97" type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span>A very critical observer may remark an inaccuracy in introducing his lordship as listening to the sound of a sea-fight , in which he was himself actually engaged .<span corresp="#note98" type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span>But Dryden did not mean to identify his speakers , and those shadowed out under them , otherwise than in their capacity of critics and authors .</p>
   <p>Dryden has , with infinite address , avoided , or overcome , the obstacles which commonly attend an argumentative discussion , in form of a dialogue . The author of such disputations , in general , so obviously favours one of the combatants , that we as soon expect Hector to slay Achilles , or Turnus to defeat Æneas , as nourish the least hope of the unfriended champion making any effectual resistance . Besides , in prepared arguments of this sort , as in prepared jests on the stage , there is an obvious opening left for those thrusts on which the author chiefly depends for success ; so that , instead of admiring the victor , we are angry at the bad address of his antagonist . All these obstacles Dryden has contrived to surmount , by the number of his characters , and the variety of their dialogue , where not only the argument of Neander 's antagonists is fairly stated , but the topics are so judiciously varied , that the reader is brought to the point which the author aims at , without stiffness or constraint , as if in the ordinary flow of literary conversation . Thus , as we never see the purpose which Dryden wishes to attain , we arrive at his conclusion without fatigue or prejudice .</p>
   <p>The “ Essay on Dramatic Poetry ” was assailed by several critics . Martin Clifford , of the Charter-House , accused our author of pilfering from the French critics , in the second of four very abusive letters . The only existing edition of these diatribes is one in 1687 ; but , from their date and import , this may have been a reprint . Sir Robert Howard also attacked the Essay , in the preface to his “ Duke of Lerma , ” which led Dryden to assert his preference of rhyming tragedies , in the Defence prefixed to the “ Indian Emperor . ” See Vol . III . p. 263 .</p>
   <p>This Essay was first published in 1668 , or perhaps in the December preceding . Sixteen years afterwards , Dryden bestowed on it a thorough revisal ; and having , in many places , altered and amended the expression with unusual care , he published a second edition in 1684 , with the following dedication to Lord Buckhurst , afterwards Earl of Dorset .</p>

    <head>MY LORD ,</head>
    <head>As I was lately reviewing my loose papers , amongst the rest I found this Essay ; the writing of which , in this rude and indigested manner , wherein your lordship now sees it , served as an amusement to me in the country , when the violence of the last plague had driven me from the town .<span corresp="#note99" type="note_anchor">[ 99 ]</span>Seeing , then , our theatres shut up , I was engaged in these kind of thoughts with the same delight , with which men think upon their absent mistresses . I confess I find many things in this discourse , which I do not now approve ; my judgment being not a little altered since the writing of it , but whether for the better , or the worse , I know not : neither , indeed , is it much material in an Essay , where all I have said is problematical . For the way of writing plays in verse , which I have seemed to favour , I have , since that time , laid the practice of it aside , till I have more leisure , because I find it troublesome and slow : But I am no way altered from my opinion of it , at least with any reasons which have opposed it .<span corresp="#note100" type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>For your lordship may easily observe , that none are very violent against it , but those who either have not attempted it , or who have succeeded ill in their attempt . It is enough for me to have your lordship 's example for my excuse in that little which I have done in it ; and I am sure my adversaries can bring no such arguments against verse , as those with which the fourth act of “ Pompey ” will furnish me in its defence .<span corresp="#note101" type="note_anchor">[ 101 ]</span>Yet , my lord , you must suffer me a little to complain of you , that you too soon withdraw from us a contentment , of which we expected the continuance , because you gave it us so early . It is a revolt , without occasion , from your party , where your merits had already raised you to the highest commands , and where you have not the excuse of other men , that you have been ill used , and therefore laid down arms . I know no other quarrel you can have to verse , than that which Spurina had to his beauty , when he tore and mangled the features of his face , only because they pleased too well the sight .<span corresp="#note102" type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span>It was an honour which seemed to wait for you , to lead out a new colony of writers from the mother-nation : and , upon the first spreading of your ensigns , there had been many in a readiness to have followed so fortunate a leader ; if not all , yet the better part of poets :</head>
     <l n="1">Pars , indocili melior grege ; mollis et exspes</l>
     <l n="2">Inominata perprimat cubilia .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am almost of opinion , that we should force you to accept of the command , as sometimes the prætorian bands have compelled their captains to receive the empire . The court , which is the best and surest judge of writing , has generally allowed of verse ; and , in the town , it has found favourers of wit and quality . As for your own particular , my lord , you have yet youth and time enough to give part of them to the divertisement of the public , before you enter into the serious and more unpleasant business of the world . That which the French poet said of the temple of Love , may be as well applied to the temple of the Muses . The words , as near as I can remember them , were these :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Le jeune homme à mauvaise grace ,</l>
     <l n="2">N'ayant pas adoré dans le Temple d'Amour ;</l>
     <l n="3">Il faut qu'il entre ; et pour le sage</l>
     <l n="4">Si ce n'est pas son vrai sejour ,</l>
     <l n="5">C'est un gîte sur son passage .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I leave the words to work their effect upon your lordship in their own language , because no other can so well express the nobleness of the thought ; and wish you may be soon called to bear a part in the affairs of the nation , where I know the world expects you , and wonders why you have been so long forgotten ; there being no person amongst our young nobility , on whom the eyes of all men are so much bent . But , in the mean time , your lordship may imitate the course of nature , who gives us the flower before the fruit ; that I may speak to you in the language of the Muses , which I have taken from an excellent poem to the king :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">As Nature , when she fruit designs , thinks fit</l>
     <l n="2">By beauteous blossoms to proceed to it ;</l>
     <l n="3">And while she does accomplish all the spring ,</l>
     <l n="4">Birds to her secret operations sing .<span corresp="#note103" type="note_anchor">[ 103 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>I confess , I have no greater reason , in addressing this Essay to your lordship , than that it might awaken in you the desire of writing something , in whatever kind it be , which might be an honour to our age and country . And methinks it might have the same effect on you , which Homer tells us the fight of the Greeks and Trojans before the fleet , had on the spirit of Achilles ; who , though he had resolved not to engage , yet found a martial warmth to steal upon him at the sight of blows , the sound of trumpets , and the cries of fighting men . For my own part , if , in treating of this subject , I sometimes dissent from the opinion of better wits , I declare it is not so much to combat their opinions , as to defend my own , which were first made public .<span corresp="#note104" type="note_anchor">[ 104 ]</span>Sometimes , like a scholar in a fencing-school , I put forth myself , and show my own ill play , on purpose to be better taught . Sometimes I stand desperately to my arms , like the foot when deserted by their horse , not in hope to overcome , but only to yield on more honourable terms . And yet , my lord , this war of opinions , you well know , has fallen out among the writers of all ages , and sometimes betwixt friends . Only it has been prosecuted by some , like pedants , with violence of words ; and managed by others like gentlemen , with candour and civility . Even Tully had a controversy with his dear Atticus ; and in one of his dialogues makes him sustain the part of an enemy in philosophy , who , in his letters , is his confident of state , and made privy to the most weighty affairs of the Roman senate . And the same respect which was paid by Tully to Atticus , we find returned to him afterwards by Cæsar , on a like occasion , who , answering his book in praise of Cato , made it not so much his business to condemn Cato , as to praise Cicero .</p>
   <p>But that I may decline some part of the encounter with my adversaries , whom I am neither willing to combat , nor well able to resist ; I will give your lordship the relation of a dispute betwixt some of our wits on the same subject , in which they did not only speak of plays in verse , but mingled , in the freedom of discourse , some things of the ancient , many of the modern , ways of writing ; comparing those with these , and the wits of our nation with those of others : it is true they differed in their opinions , as it is probable they would : neither do I take upon me to reconcile , but to relate them ; and that , as Tacitus professes of himself , Sine studio partium , aut irâ , without passion , or interest ; leaving your lordship to decide it in favour of which part you shall judge most reasonable , and withal , to pardon the many errors of</p>
   <p>Your lordship 's Most obedient humble servant , JOHN DRYDEN .</p>

   <p>TO THE READER .</p>
   <p>The drift of the ensuing discourse was chiefly to vindicate the honour of our English writers , from the censure of those who unjustly prefer the French before them . This I intimate , lest any should think me so exceeding vain , as to teach others an art which they understand much better than myself . But if this incorrect Essay , written in the country without the help of books , or advice of friends , shall find any acceptance in the world , I promise to myself a better success of the Second Part , wherein I shall more fully treat of the virtues and faults of the English poets , who have written either in this , the epic , or the lyric way .<span corresp="#note105" type="note_anchor">[ 105 ]</span></p>

   <p>AN</p>
   <p>ESSAY</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>DRAMATIC POESY .</p>
   <p>It was that memorable day , in the first summer of the late war , when our navy engaged the Dutch ;<span corresp="#note106" type="note_anchor">[ 106 ]</span>a day wherein the two most mighty and best appointed fleets which any age had ever seen , disputed the command of the greater half of the globe , the commerce of nations , and the riches of the universe : while these vast floating bodies , on either side , moved against each other in parallel lines , and our countrymen , under the happy conduct of his Royal Highness ,<span corresp="#note107" type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>went breaking , by little and little , into the line of the enemies ; the noise of the cannon from both navies reached our ears about the city ; so that all men being alarmed with it , and in a dreadful suspense of the event , which they knew was then deciding , every one went following the sound as his fancy led him ; and leaving the town almost empty , some took towards the Park , some cross the river , others down it ; all seeking the noise in the depth of silence .</p>
   <p>Amongst the rest , it was the fortune of Eugenius , Crites , Lisideius , and Neander , to be in company together : three of them persons whom their wit and quality have made known to all the town ; and whom I have chose to hide under these borrowed names , that they may not suffer by so ill a relation as I am going to make of their discourse .</p>
   <p>Taking then a barge , which a servant of Lisideius had provided for them , they made haste to shoot the bridge , and left behind them that great fall of waters which hindered them from hearing what they desired : after which , having disengaged themselves from many vessels which rode at anchor in the Thames , and almost blocked up the passage towards Greenwich , they ordered the watermen to let fall their oars more gently ; and then every one favouring his own curiosity with a strict silence , it was not long ere they perceived the air to break about them like the noise of distant thunder , or of swallows in a chimney : those little undulations of sound , though almost vanishing before they reached them , yet still seeming to retain somewhat of their first horror which they had betwixt the fleets . After they had attentively listened till such time as the sound by little and little went from them ,<span corresp="#note108" type="note_anchor">[ 108 ]</span>Eugenius , lifting up his head , and taking notice of it , was the first who congratulated to the rest that happy omen of our nation 's victory : adding , that we had but this to desire in confirmation of it , that we might hear no more of that noise which was now leaving the English coast . When the rest had concurred in the same opinion , Crites , a person of a sharp judgement , and somewhat too delicate a taste in wit , which the world hath mistaken in him for ill nature ,<span corresp="#note109" type="note_anchor">[ 109 ]</span>said , smiling to us , that if the concernment of this battle had not been so exceeding great , he could scarce have wished the victory at the price he knew he must pay for it , in being subject to the reading and hearing of so many ill verses as he was sure would be made on that subject . Adding , that no argument could ‘ scape some of those eternal rhymers , who watch a battle with more diligence than the ravens and birds of prey ; and the worst of them surest to be first in upon the quarry ; while the better able , either out of modesty writ not at all , or set that due value upon their poems , as to let them be often desired , and long expected . There are some of those impertinent people of whom you speak , answered Lisideius , who , to my knowledge , are already so provided , either way , that they can produce not only a panegyric upon the victory , but , if need be , a funeral elegy on the duke ; wherein , after they have crowned his valour with many laurels , they will at last deplore the odds under which he fell , concluding , that his courage deserved a better destiny . All the company smiled at the conceit of Lisideius ; but Crites , more eager than before , began to make particular exceptions against some writers , and said , the public magistrate ought to send betimes to forbid them ; and that it concerned the peace and quiet of all honest people , that ill poets should be as well silenced as seditious preachers . In my opinion , replied Eugenius , you pursue your point too far ; for as to my own particular , I am so great a lover of poesy , that I could wish them all rewarded , who attempt but to do well ; at least , I would not have them worse used than one of their brethren was by Sylla the dictator : Quem in concione vidimus , ( says Tully ,) cum ei libellum malus poeta de populo subjecisset , quod epigramma in eum fecisset tantummodo alternis versibus longiusculis , statim ex iis rebus quas tunc vendebat jubere ei præmium tribui , sub ea conditione ne quid postea scriberet . I could wish with all my heart , replied Crites , that many whom we know were as bountifully thanked upon the same condition , that they would never trouble us again . For amongst others , I have a mortal apprehension of two poets , whom this victory , with the help of both her wings , will never be able to escape . ‘ Tis easy to guess whom you intend , said Lisideius ; and without naming them , I ask you if one of them does not perpetually pay us with clenches upon words , and a certain clownish kind of raillery ?<span corresp="#note110" type="note_anchor">[ 110 ]</span>If now and then he does not offer a catachresis or Cleivelandism ,<span corresp="#note111" type="note_anchor">[ 111 ]</span>wresting and torturing a word into another meaning : in fine , if he be not one of those whom the French would call un mauvais buffon ; one who is so much a well-willer to the satire , that he intends at least to spare no man ; and though he cannot strike a blow to hurt any , yet he ought to be punished for the malice of the action ; as our witches are justly hanged , because they think themselves to be such ; and suffer deservedly for believing they did mischief , because they meant it .<span corresp="#note112" type="note_anchor">[ 112 ]</span>You have described him , said Crites , so exactly , that I am afraid to come after you with my other extremity of poetry : he is one of those , who , having had some advantage of education and converse , knows better than the other what a poet should be , but puts it into practice more unluckily than any man . His style and matter are every where alike ; he is the most calm , peaceable writer you ever read : he never disquiets your passions with the least concernment , but still leaves you in as even a temper as he found you ; he is a very leveller in poetry : he creeps along with ten little words in every line , and helps out his numbers with For to , and Unto , and all the pretty expletives he can find , till he drags them to the end of another line ; while the sense is left tired half way behind it : he doubly starves all his verses , first , for want of thought , and then of expression . His poetry neither has wit in it , nor seems to have it ; like him in Martial :</p>
   <p>Pauper videri Cinna vult , et est pauper .</p>
   <p>He affects plainness , to cover his want of imagination : when he writes the serious way , the highest flight of his fancy is some miserable antithesis or seeming contradiction ; and in the comic , he is still reaching at some thin conceit , the ghost of a jest , and that too flies before him , never to be caught . These swallows which we see before us on the Thames , are the just resemblance of his wit : you may observe how near the water they stoop , how many proffers they make to dip , and yet how seldom they touch it ; and when they do , ‘ tis but the surface : they skim over it but to catch a gnat , and then mount into the air and leave it .— Well , gentlemen , said Eugenius , you may speak your pleasure of these authors ; but though I and some few more about the town may give you a peaceable hearing , yet assure yourselves , there are multitudes who would think you malicious , and them injured ; especially him whom you first described . He is the very Withers of the city :[ 113 ] they have bought more editions of his works than would serve to lay under all their pies at the Lord Mayor 's Christmas . When his famous poem first came out in the year 1660 ,<span corresp="#note114" type="note_anchor">[ 114 ]</span>I have seen them reading it in the midst of Change-time ; nay , so vehement they were at it , that they lost their bargain by the candles ’ ends .<span corresp="#note115" type="note_anchor">[ 115 ]</span>But what will you say if he has been received amongst great persons ? I can assure you he is , this day , the envy of one , who is lord in the art of quibbling ; and who does not take it well , that any man should intrude so far into his province . All I would wish , replied Crites , is , that they who love his writings , may still admire him , and his fellow poet : Qui Bavium non odit , &amp; c. is curse sufficient . And farther , added Lisideius , I believe there is no man who writes well , but would think he had hard measure , if their admirers should praise any thing of his : Nam quos contemnimus , eorum quoque laudes contemnimus . There are so few who write well in this age , said Crites , that methinks any praises should be welcome ; they neither rise to the dignity of the last age , nor to any of the ancients : and we may cry out of the writers of this time , with more reason than Petronius of his , Pace vestrâ liceat dixisse , primi omnium eloquentiam perdidistis : you have debauched the true old poetry so far , that nature , which is the soul of it , is not in any of your writings .</p>
   <p>If your quarrel ( said Eugenius ) to those who now write , be grounded only on your reverence to antiquity , there is no man more ready to adore those great Greeks and Romans than I am : but , on the other side , I cannot think so contemptibly of the age in which I live , or so dishonourably of my own country , as not to judge we equal the ancients in most kinds of poesy , and in some surpass them ; neither know I any reason why I may not be as zealous for the reputation of our age , as we find the ancients themselves were in reverence to those who lived before them . For you hear your Horace saying ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Indignor quidquam reprehendi , non quia crassé</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">

     <l n="5">Scire velim , pretium chartis quotus arroget annus ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But I see I am engaging in a wide dispute , where the arguments are not like to reach close on either side ; for poesy is of so large an extent , and so many , both of the ancients and moderns , have done well in all kinds of it , that in citing one against the other , we shall take up more time this evening , than each man 's occasions will allow him : therefore I would ask Crites to what part of poesy he would confine his arguments , and whether he would defend the general cause of the ancients against the moderns , or oppose any age of the moderns against this of ours .</p>
   <p>Crites , a little while considering upon this demand , told Eugenius , that if he pleased he would limit their dispute to Dramatic Poesy ; in which he thought it not difficult to prove , either that the ancients were superior to the moderns , or the last age to this of ours .<span corresp="#note116" type="note_anchor">[ 116 ]</span></p>
   <p>Eugenius was somewhat surprised , when he heard Crites make choice of that subject . For aught I see , said he , I have undertaken a harder province than I imagined ; for , though I never judged the plays of the Greek or Roman poets comparable to ours , yet , on the other side , those we now see acted come short of many which were written in the last age . But my comfort is , if we are overcome , it will be only by our own countrymen : and if we yield to them in this one part of poesy , we more surpass them in all the other ; for in the epic or lyric way , it will be hard for them to shew us one such amongst them , as we have many now living , or who lately were . They can produce nothing so courtly writ , or which expresses so much the conversation of a gentleman , as Sir John Suckling ; nothing so even , sweet , and flowing , as Mr Waller ; nothing so majestic , so correct , as Sir John Denham ; nothing so elevated , so copious , and full of spirit , as Mr Cowley . As for the Italian , French , and Spanish plays , I can make it evident , that those who now write , surpass them ; and that the drama is wholly ours .</p>
   <p>All of them were thus far of Eugenius his opinion , that the sweetness of English verse was never understood or practised by our fathers ; even Crites himself did not much oppose it : and every one was willing to acknowledge how much our poesy is improved , by the happiness of some writers yet living ; who first taught us to mould our thoughts into easy and significant words , to retrench the superfluities of expression , and to make our rhyme so properly a part of the verse , that it should never mislead the sense , but itself be led and governed by it .</p>
   <p>Eugenius was going to continue this discourse , when Lisideius told him , that it was necessary , before they proceeded further , to take a standing measure of their controversy ; for how was it possible to be decided , who wrote the best plays , before we know what a play should be ? but , this once agreed on by both parties , each might have recourse to it , either to prove his own advantages , or to discover the failings of his adversary .</p>
   <p>He had no sooner said this , but all desired the favour of him to give the definition of a play ; and they were the more importunate , because neither Aristotle , nor Horace , nor any other , who had writ of that subject , had ever done it .</p>
   <p>Lisideius , after some modest denials , at last confessed he had a rude notion of it ; indeed rather a description than a definition ; but which served to guide him in his private thoughts , when he was to make a judgment of what others writ : that he conceived a play ought to be , “ A just and lively image of human nature , representing its passions and humours , and the changes of fortune to which it is subject , for the delight and instruction of mankind . ”</p>
   <p>This definition ( though Crites raised a logical objection against it — that it was only à genere et fine , and so not altogether perfect ) was yet well received by the rest : and after they had given order to the watermen to turn their barge , and row softly , that they might take the cool of the evening in their return , Crites , being desired by the company to begin , spoke on behalf of the ancients , in this manner :—</p>
   <p>If confidence presage a victory , Eugenius , in his own opinion , has already triumphed over the ancients : nothing seems more easy to him , than to overcome those whom it is our greatest praise to have imitated well ; for we do not only build upon their foundations , but by their models . Dramatic Poesy had time enough , reckoning from Thespis ( who first invented it ) to Aristophanes , to be born , to grow up , and to flourish in maturity . It has been observed of arts and sciences , that in one and the same century they have arrived to great perfection ; and no wonder , since every age has a kind of universal genius , which inclines those that live in it to some particular studies : the work then being pushed on by many hands , must of necessity go forward .</p>
   <p>Is it not evident , in these last hundred years , ( when the study of philosophy has been the business of all the Virtuosi in Christendom ,) that almost a new nature has been revealed to us ? that more errors of the school have been detected , more useful experiments in philosophy have been made , more noble secrets in optics , medicine , anatomy , astronomy , discovered , than in all those credulous and doting ages from Aristotle to us ?— so true it is , that nothing spreads more fast than science , when rightly and generally cultivated .</p>
   <p>Add to this , the more than common emulation that was in those times , of writing well ; which though it be found in all ages , and all persons that pretend to the same reputation , yet poesy being then in more esteem than now it is , had greater honours decreed to the professors of it , and consequently the rivalship was more high between them . They had judges ordained to decide their merit , and prizes to reward it ; and historians have been diligent to record of Æschylus , Euripides , Sophocles , Lycophron , and the rest of them , both who they were that vanquished in these wars of the theatre , and how often they were crowned : while the Asian kings and Grecian commonwealths scarce afforded them a nobler subject , than the unmanly luxuries of a debauched court , or giddy intrigues of a factious city :— Alit æmulatio ingenia , ( says Paterculus ) et nunc invidia , nunc admiratio incitationem accendit : Emulation is the spur of wit ; and sometimes envy , sometimes admiration , quickens our endeavours .</p>
   <p>But now since the rewards of honour are taken away , that virtuous emulation is turned into direct malice ; yet so slothful , that it contents itself to condemn and cry down others , without attempting to do better : ‘ tis a reputation too unprofitable , to take the necessary pains for it ; yet wishing they had it , that desire is incitement enough to hinder others from it . And this , in short , Eugenius , is the reason , why you have now so few good poets , and so many severe judges . Certainly , to imitate the ancients well , much labour and long study is required ; which pains , I have already shewn , our poets would want encouragement to take , if yet they had ability to go through the work . Those ancients have been faithful imitators , and wise observers of that nature which is so torn and ill represented in our plays ; they have handed down to us a perfect resemblance of her ; which we , like ill copiers , neglecting to look on , have rendered monstrous , and disfigured . But , that you may know how much you are indebted to those your masters , and be ashamed to have so ill requited them , I must remember you , that all the rules by which we practise the drama at this day , ( either such as relate to the justness and symmetry of the plot ; or the episodical ornaments , such as descriptions , narrations , and other beauties , which are not essential to the play ;) were delivered to us from the observations which Aristotle made , of those poets , who either lived before him , or were his contemporaries . We have added nothing of our own , except we have the confidence to say , our wit is better ; of which none boast in this our age , but such as understand not theirs . Of that book which Aristotle has left us , ωερὶ τῆς Ποιητικῆς , Horace his “ Art of Poetry , ” is an excellent comment , and , I believe , restores to us that Second Book of his concerning comedy , which is wanting in him .</p>
   <p>Out of these two have been extracted the famous rules which the French call Des Trois Unites , or the Three Unities , which ought to be observed in every regular play ; namely , of time , place , and action .</p>
   <p>The unity of time they comprehend in twenty-four hours , the compass of a natural day , or as near as it can be contrived ; and the reason of it is obvious to every one ,— that the time of the feigned action , or fable of the play , should be proportioned as near as can be to the duration of that time in which it is represented : since therefore all plays are acted on the theatre in a space of time much within the compass of twenty-four hours , that play is to be thought the nearest imitation of nature , whose plot or action is confined within that time . And , by the same rule which concludes this general proportion of time , it follows , that all the parts of it are ( as near as may be ) to be equally subdivided ; namely , that one act take not up the supposed time of half a day , which is out of proportion to the rest ; since the other four are then to be straitened within the compass of the remaining half : for it is unnatural , that one act , which being spoke or written , is not longer than the rest , should be supposed longer by the audience ; it is therefore the poet 's duty , to take care , that no act should be imagined to exceed the time in which it is represented on the stage ; and that the intervals and inequalities of time be supposed to fall out between the acts .</p>
   <p>This rule of time , how well it has been observed by the ancients , most of their plays will witness . You see them in their tragedies , ( wherein to follow this rule is certainly most difficult ,) from the very beginning of their plays , falling close into that part of the story which they intend for the action , or principal object of it , leaving the former part to be delivered by narration : so that they set the audience , as it were , at the post where the race is to be concluded ; and saving them the tedious expectation of seeing the poet set out and ride the beginning of the course , they suffer you not to behold him , till he is in sight of the goal , and just upon you .</p>
   <p>For the second unity , which is that of place , the ancients meant by it , that the scene ought to be continued through the play , in the same place where it was laid in the beginning : for the stage , on which it is represented , being but one and the same place , it is unnatural to conceive it many ; and those far distant from one another . I will not deny , but by the variation of painted scenes , the fancy ( which in these cases will contribute to its own deceit ) may sometimes imagine it several places , with some appearance of probability ; yet it still carries the greater likelihood of truth , if those places be supposed so near each other , as in the same town or city , which may all be comprehended under the larger denomination of one place : for a greater distance will bear no proportion to the shortness of time which is allotted , in the acting , to pass from one of them to another . For the observation of this , next to the ancients , the French are to be most commended . They tie themselves so strictly to the unity of place , that you never see in any of their plays , a scene changed in the middle of an act : if the act begins in a garden , a street , or chamber , ‘ tis ended in the same place ; and that you may know it to be the same , the stage is so supplied with persons , that it is never empty all the time : he who enters second , has business with him who was on before ; and before the second quits the stage , a third appears who has business with him . This Corneille calls la liaison des Scenes , the continuity or joining of the scenes ; and ‘ tis a good mark of a well-contrived play , when all the persons are known to each other , and every one of them has some affairs with all the rest .</p>
   <p>As for the third unity , which is that of action , the ancients meant no other by it than what the logicians do by their finis , the end or scope of any action ; that which is the first in intention , and last in execution . Now the poet is to aim at one great and complete action , to the carrying on of which all things in his play , even the very obstacles , are to be subservient ; and the reason of this is as evident as any of the former .</p>
   <p>For two actions equally laboured and driven on by the writer , would destroy the unity of the poem ; it would be no longer one play , but two : not but that there may be many actions in a play , as Ben Jonson has observed in his “ Discoveries ;"[ 117 ] but they must be all subservient to the great one , which our language happily expresses in the name of under-plots : such as in Terence 's “ Eunuch ” is the difference and reconcilement of Thais and Phædria , which is not the chief business of the play , but promotes the marriage of Chærea and Chremes 's sister , principally intended by the poet . There ought to be but one action , says Corneille , that is , one complete action , which leaves the mind of the audience in a full repose ; but this cannot be brought to pass , but by many other imperfect actions , which conduce to it , and hold the audience in a delightful suspense of what will be .</p>
   <p>If by these rules ( to omit many other drawn from the precepts and practice of the ancients ) we should judge our modern plays , ‘ tis probable , that few of them would endure the trial : that which should be the business of a day , takes up in some of them an age ; instead of one action , they are the epitomes of a man 's life ; and for one spot of ground ( which the stage should represent ) we are sometimes in more countries than the map can show us .</p>
   <p>But if we allow the ancients to have contrived well , we must acknowledge them to have written better . Questionless we are deprived of a great stock of wit in the loss of Menander among the Greek poets , and of Cæcilius , Afranius , and Varius , among the Romans . We may guess at Menander 's excellency , by the plays of Terence , who translated some of his ; and yet wanted so much of him , that he was called by C. Cæsar the half-Menander ; and may judge of Varius , by the testimonies of Horace , Martial , and Velleius Paterculus . ‘ Tis probable that these , could they be recovered , would decide the controversy ; but so long as Aristophanes and Plautus are extant , while the tragedies of Euripides , Sophocles , and Seneca , are in our hands , I can never see one of those plays which are now written , but it increases my admiration of the ancients . And yet I must acknowledge further , that to admire them as we ought , we should understand them better than we do . Doubtless many things appear flat to us , the wit of which depended on some custom or story , which never came to our knowledge ; or perhaps on some criticism in their language , which being so long dead , and only remaining in their books , ‘ tis not possible they should make us understand perfectly . To read Macrobius , explaining the propriety and elegancy of many words in Virgil , which I had before passed over without consideration , as common things , is enough to assure me , that I ought to think the same of Terence ; and that in the purity of his style , ( which Tully so much valued , that he ever carried his works about him ,) there is yet left in him great room for admiration , if I knew but where to place it . In the mean time , I must desire you to take notice , that the greatest man of the last age ( Ben Jonson ) was willing to give place to them in all things : he was not only a professed imitator of Horace , but a learned plagiary of all the others ; you track him every where in their snow . If Horace , Lucan , Petronius Arbiter , Seneca , and Juvenal , had their own from him , there are few serious thoughts which are new in him : you will pardon me , therefore , if I presume he loved their fashion , when he wore their clothes .<span corresp="#note118" type="note_anchor">[ 118 ]</span>But since I have otherwise a great veneration for him , and you , Eugenius , prefer him above all other poets ,<span corresp="#note119" type="note_anchor">[ 119 ]</span>I will use no farther argument to you than his example : I will produce before you father Ben , dressed in all the ornaments and colours of the ancients ; you will need no other guide to our party , if you follow him ; and whether you consider the bad plays of our age , or regard the good plays of the last , both the best and worst of the modern poets will equally instruct you to admire the ancients .</p>
   <p>Crites had no sooner left speaking , but Eugenius , who had waited with some impatience for it , thus began :—</p>
   <p>I have observed in your speech , that the former part of it is convincing , as to what the moderns have profited by the rules of the ancients ; but in the latter you are careful to conceal how much they have excelled them . We own all the helps we have from them , and want neither veneration nor gratitude , while we acknowledge , that to overcome them we must make use of the advantages we have received from them : but to these assistances we have joined our own industry ; for , had we sat down with a dull imitation of them , we might then have lost somewhat of the old perfection , but never acquired any that was new . We draw not therefore after their lines , but those of nature ; and having the life before us , besides the experience of all they knew , it is no wonder if we hit some airs and features which they have missed . I deny not what you urge of arts and sciences , that they have flourished in some ages more than others ; but your instance in philosophy makes for me : for if natural causes be more known now than in the time of Aristotle , because more studied , it follows , that poesy and other arts may , with the same pains , arrive still nearer to perfection ; and , that granted , it will rest for you to prove , that they wrought more perfect images of human life , than we ; which seeing in your discourse you have avoided to make good , it shall now be my task to shew you some part of their defects , and some few excellencies of the moderns . And I think there is none among us can imagine I do it enviously , or with purpose to detract from them ; for what interest of fame or profit can the living lose by the reputation of the dead ? On the other side , it is a great truth which Velleius Paterculus affirms : Audita visis libentius laudamus ; et præsentia invidiâ , præterita admiratione prosequimur ; et his nos obrui , illis instrui credimus : that praise or censure is certainly the most sincere , which unbribed posterity shall give us .</p>
   <p>Be pleased then , in the first place , to take notice , that the Greek poesy , which Crites has affirmed to have arrived to perfection in the reign of the old comedy , was so far from it , that the distinction of it into acts was not known to them ; or if it were , it is yet so darkly delivered to us , that we cannot make it out .</p>
   <p>All we know of it is , from the singing of their chorus ; and that too is so uncertain , that in some of their plays we have reason to conjecture they sung more than five times . Aristotle indeed divides the integral parts of a play into four . First , the Protasis , or entrance , which gives light only to the characters of the persons , and proceeds very little into any part of the action . Secondly , the Epitasis , or working up of the plot ; where the play grows warmer , the design or action of it is drawing on , and you see something promising that it will come to pass . Thirdly , the Catastasis , called by the Romans , Status , the height and full growth of the play : we may call it properly the counter-turn , which destroys that expectation , embroils the action in new difficulties , and leaves you far distant from that hope in which it found you ; as you may have observed in a violent stream , resisted by a narrow passage ,— it runs round to an eddy , and carries back the waters with more swiftness than it brought them on . Lastly , the Catastrophe , which the Grecians called λυσις , the French le denouement , and we the discovery , or unravelling of the plot : there you see all things settling again upon their first foundations , and , the obstacles which hindered the design or action of the play once removed , it ends with that resemblance of truth and nature , that the audience are satisfied with the conduct of it . Thus this great man delivered to us the image of a play ; and I must confess it is so lively , that from thence much light has been derived to the forming it more perfectly into acts and scenes : but what poet first limited to five the number of the acts , I know not ; only we see it so firmly established in the time of Horace , that he gives it for a rule in comedy ,— Neu brevior quinto , neu sit productior actu . So that you see the Grecians cannot be said to have consummated this art ; writing rather by entrances , than by acts , and having rather a general indigested notion of a play , than knowing how , and where to bestow the particular graces of it .</p>
   <p>But since the Spaniards at this day allow but three acts , which they call Jornadas , to a play , and the Italians in many of theirs follow them , when I condemn the ancients , I declare it is not altogether because they have not five acts to every play , but because they have not confined themselves to one certain number : it is building an house without a model ; and when they succeeded in such undertakings , they ought to have sacrificed to Fortune , not to the Muses .</p>
   <p>Next , for the plot , which Aristotle called τὸ μυθὸς , and often των πραγμάτων συ ΄ νθεσις , and from him the Romans Fabula , it has already been judiciously observed by a late writer , that in their tragedies it was only some tale derived from Thebes or Troy , or at least something that happened in those two ages ; which was worn so thread-bare by the pens of all the epic poets , and even by tradition itself of the talkative Greeklings , ( as Ben Jonson calls them ,) that before it came upon the stage , it was already known to all the audience ; and the people , so soon as ever they heard the name of Œdipus , knew as well as the poet , that he had killed his father by a mistake , and committed incest with his mother , before the play ; that they were now to hear of a great plague , an oracle , and the ghost of Laius : so that they sate with a yawning kind of expectation , till he was to come with his eyes pulled out , and speak a hundred or more verses in a tragic tone , in complaint of his misfortunes . But one Œdipus , Hercules , or Medea , had been tolerable ; poor people , they escaped not so good cheap ; they had still the chapon bouillé set before them , till their appetites were cloyed with the same dish , and , the novelty being gone , the pleasure vanished ; so that one main end of Dramatic Poesy in its definition , which was to cause delight , was of consequence destroyed .<span corresp="#note120" type="note_anchor">[ 120 ]</span></p>
   <p>In their comedies , the Romans generally borrowed their plots from the Greek poets ; and theirs was commonly a little girl stolen or wandered from her parents , brought back unknown to the city , there got with child by some lewd young fellow , who , by the help of his servant , cheats his father ; and when her time comes , to cry — Juno Lucina , fer opem , one or other sees a little box or cabinet which was carried away with her , and so discovers her to her friends , if some god do not prevent it , by coming down in a machine , and taking the thanks of it to himself .</p>
   <p>By the plot you may guess much of the characters of the persons . An old father , who would willingly , before he dies , see his son well married ; his debauched son , kind in his nature to his mistress , but miserably in want of money ; a servant or slave , who has so much wit to strike in with him , and help to dupe his father ; a braggadocio captain , a parasite , and a lady of pleasure .</p>
   <p>As for the poor honest maid , on whom the story is built , and who ought to be one of the principal actors in the play , she is commonly a mute in it : she has the breeding of the old Elizabeth way , which was for maids to be seen , and not to be heard ; and it is enough you know she is willing to be married , when the fifth act requires it .</p>
   <p>These are plots built after the Italian mode of houses ,— you see through them all at once : the characters are indeed the imitations of nature , but so narrow , as if they had imitated only an eye or an hand , and did not dare to venture on the lines of a face , or the proportion of a body .</p>
   <p>But in how straight a compass soever they have bounded their plots and characters , we will pass it by , if they have regularly pursued them , and perfectly observed those three unities of time , place , and action ; the knowledge of which you say is derived to us from them . But , in the first place , give me leave to tell you , that the unity of place , however it might be practised by them , was never any of their rules : we neither find it in Aristotle , Horace , or any who have written of it , till in our age the French poets first made it a precept of the stage . The unity of time , even Terence himself , who was the best and most regular of them , has neglected : his “ Heautontimorumenos , ” or Self-punisher , takes up visibly two days , says Scaliger ; the two first acts concluding the first day , the three last the day ensuing ; and Euripides , in tying himself to one day , has committed an absurdity never to be forgiven him ; for in one of his tragedies he has made Theseus go from Athens to Thebes , which was about forty English miles , under the walls of it to give battle , and appear victorious in the next act ; and yet , from the time of his departure to the return of the Nuntius , who gives the relation of his victory , Æthra and the Chorus have but thirty-six verses ; which is not for every mile a verse .</p>
   <p>The like error is as evident in Terence his “ Eunuch , ” when Laches , the old man , enters by mistake into the house of Thais ; where , betwixt his exit , and the entrance of Pythias , who comes to give ample relation of the disorders he has raised within , Parmeno , who was left upon the stage , has not above five lines to speak . C'est bien employer un temps si court , says the French poet , who furnished me with one of the observations : and almost all their tragedies will afford us examples of the like nature .</p>
   <p>It is true , they have kept the continuity , or , as you called it , liaison des Scenes , somewhat better : two do not perpetually come in together , talk , and go out together ; and other two succeed them , and do the same throughout the act , which the English call by the name of single scenes ; but the reason is , because they have seldom above two or three scenes , properly so called , in every act ; for it is to be accounted a new scene , not only every time the stage is empty , but every person who enters , though to others , makes it so ; because he introduces a new business . Now the plots of their plays being narrow , and the persons few , one of their acts was written in a less compass than one of our well-wrought scenes ; and yet they are often deficient even in this . To go no farther than Terence , you find in the “ Eunuch , ” Antipho entering single in the midst of the third act , after Chremes and Pythias were gone off : in the same play you have likewise Dorias beginning the fourth act alone ; and after she has made a relation of what was done at the Soldier 's entertainment , ( which by the way was very inartificial , because she was presumed to speak directly to the audience , and to acquaint them with what was necessary to be known , but yet should have been so contrived by the poet , as to have been told by persons of the drama to one another , and so by them to have come to the knowledge of the people ,) she quits the stage , and Phædria enters next , alone likewise : he also gives you an account of himself , and of his returning from the country , in monologue ; to which unnatural way of narration Terence is subject in all his plays . In his “ Adelphi , or Brothers , ” Syrus and Demea enter after the scene was broken by the departure of Sostrata , Geta , and Canthara ; and indeed you can scarce look into any of his comedies , where you will not presently discover the same interruption .</p>
   <p>But as they have failed both in laying of their plots , and in the management , swerving from the rules of their own art , by misrepresenting nature to us , in which they have ill satisfied one intention of a play , which was delight ; so in the instructive part they have erred worse : instead of punishing vice , and rewarding virtue , they have often shewn a prosperous wickedness , and an unhappy piety : they have set before us a bloody image of revenge in Medea , and given her dragons to convey her safe from punishment . A Priam and Astyanax murdered , and Cassandra ravished , and the lust and murder ending in the victory of him who acted them . In short , there is no indecorum in any of our modern plays , which , if I would excuse , I could not shadow with some authority from the ancients .</p>
   <p>And one farther note of them let me leave you : tragedies and comedies were not writ then as they are now , promiscuously , by the same person ; but he who found his genius bending to the one , never attempted the other way . This is so plain , that I need not instance to you , that Aristophanes , Plautus , Terence , never any of them writ a tragedy ; Æschylus , Euripides , Sophocles , and Seneca , never meddled with comedy : the sock and buskin were not worn by the same poet . Having then so much care to excel in one kind , very little is to be pardoned them , if they miscarried in it ; and this would lead me to the consideration of their wit , had not Crites given me sufficient warning not to be too bold in my judgment of it ; because , the languages being dead , and many of the customs and little accidents on which it depended , lost to us , we are not competent judges of it . But though I grant , that here and there we may miss the application of a proverb or a custom , yet a thing well said will be wit in all languages ; and though it may lose something in the translation , yet to him who reads it in the original , ‘ tis still the same ; he has an idea of its excellency , though it cannot pass from his mind into any other expression or words than those in which he finds it . When Phædria in the “ Eunuch ” had a command from his mistress to be absent two days , and encouraging himself to go through with it , said , Tandem ego non illâ caream , si sit opus , vel totum triduum ? Parmeno , to mock the softness of his master , lifting up his hands and eyes , cries out , as it were in admiration , Hui ! universum triduum ! the elegancy of which universum , though it cannot be rendered in our language , yet leaves an impression on our souls . But this happens seldom in him ; in Plautus oftener , who is infinitely too bold in his metaphors and coining words , out of which many times his wit is nothing ; which questionless was one reason why Horace falls upon him so severely in those verses :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sed proavi nostri Plautinos et numeros , et</l>
     <l n="2">Laudavere sales , nimium patienter utrumque ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ne dicam stolide .<span corresp="#note121" type="note_anchor">[ 121 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>For Horace himself was cautious to obtrude a new word on his readers , and makes custom and common use the best measure of receiving it into writings :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Multa renascentur quæ nunc [ jam ] cecidere , cadentque</l>
     <l n="2">Quæ nunc sunt in honore vocabula , si volet usus ,</l>
     <l n="3">Quem penes arbitrium est , et jus , et norma loquendi .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The not observing this rule is that which the world has blamed in our satyrist , Cleiveland ; to express a thing hard and unnaturally , is his new way of elocution . It is true , no poet but may sometimes use a catachresis ; Virgil does it ,—</p>
   <p>Mistaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho ,—</p>
   <p>in his eclogue of Pollio ; and in his seventh<span corresp="#note122" type="note_anchor">[ 122 ]</span>Æneid ,</p>
   <p>—— mirantur et undæ , Miratur nemus , insuetum fulgentia longe Scuta virum fluvio , pictasque innare carinas .</p>
   <p>And Ovid once so modestly , that he asks leave to do it :</p>
   <p>—— [ quem ] si verbo audacia detur , Haud metuam summi dixisse Palatia cœli .</p>
   <p>calling the court of Jupiter by the name of Augustus his palace ; though in another place he is more bold , where he says , Et longas visent Capitolia pompas .<span corresp="#note123" type="note_anchor">[ 123 ]</span>But to do this always , and never be able to write a line without it , though it may be admired by some few pedants , will not pass upon those who know that wit is best conveyed to us in the most easy language ; and is most to be admired when a great thought comes dressed in words so commonly received , that it is understood by the meanest apprehensions , as the best meat is the most easily digested . But we cannot read a verse of Cleiveland 's without making a face at it , as if every word were a pill to swallow : He gives us many times a hard nut to break our teeth , without a kernel for our pains . So that there is this difference betwixt his satires and Doctor Donne 's , that the one gives us deep thoughts in common language , though rough cadence ; the other gives us common thoughts in abstruse words . It is true , in some places his wit is independent of his words , as in that of the rebel Scot :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>But , to return from whence I have digressed , to the consideration of the ancients ’ writing , and their wit ; of which , by this time , you will grant us in some measure to be fit judges . Though I see many excellent thoughts in Seneca , yet he , of them who had a genius most proper for the stage , was Ovid ; he had a way of writing so fit to stir up a pleasing admiration and concernment , which are the objects of a tragedy , and to shew the various movements of a soul combating betwixt two different passions , that had he lived in our age , or in his own could have writ with our advantages , no man but must have yielded to him ; and therefore I am confident the “ Medea ” is none of his ; for though I esteem it for the gravity and sententiousness of it , which he himself concludes to be suitable to a tragedy ,— Omne genus scripti gravitate Tragœdia vincit ,— yet it moves not my soul enough to judge that he , who in the epic way wrote things so near the drama , as the story of Myrrha , of Caunus and Biblis , and the rest , should stir up no more concernment where he most endeavoured it .<span corresp="#note125" type="note_anchor">[ 125 ]</span>The master-piece of Seneca I hold to be that scene in the “ Troades , ” where Ulysses is seeking for Astyanax to kill him : there you see the tenderness of a mother , so represented in Andromache , that it raises compassion to a high degree in the reader , and bears the nearest resemblance of any thing in the tragedies of the ancients , to the excellent scenes of passion in Shakespeare , or in Fletcher .— For love-scenes you will find few among them ; their tragic poets dealt not with that soft passion , but with lust , cruelty , revenge , ambition , and those bloody actions they produced ; which were more capable of raising horror than compassion in an audience : leaving love untouched , whose gentleness would have tempered them , which is the most frequent of all the passions , and which , being the private concernment of every person , is soothed by viewing its own image in a public entertainment .</p>
   <p>Among their comedies , we find a scene or two of tenderness , and that where you would least expect it , in Plautus ; but to speak generally , their lovers say little , when they see each other , but anima mea , vita mea ; ζωὴ και ψυχῆ , as the women in Juvenal 's time used to cry out in the fury of their kindness . Any sudden gust of passion ( as an ecstasy of love in an unexpected meeting ) cannot better be expressed than in a word , and a sigh , breaking one another . Nature is dumb on such occasions ; and to make her speak , would be to represent her unlike herself . But there are a thousand other concernments of lovers , as jealousies , complaints , contrivances , and the like , where not to open their minds at large to each other , were to be wanting to their own love , and to the expectation of the audience ; who watch the movements of their minds , as much as the changes of their fortunes . For the imagining of the first is properly the work of a poet ; the latter he borrows from the historian .</p>
   <p>Eugenius was proceeding in that part of his discourse , when Crites interrupted him . I see , said he , Eugenius and I are never like to have this question decided betwixt us ; for he maintains , the moderns have acquired a new perfection in writing , I can only grant they have altered the mode of it , Homer described his heroes men of great appetites , lovers of beef broiled upon the coals , and good fellows ; contrary to the practice of the French romances , whose heroes neither eat , nor drink , nor sleep , for love . Virgil makes Æneas a bold avower of his own virtues :</p>
   <p>Sum pius Æneas famâ super æthera notus ;</p>
   <p>which , in the civility of our poets , is the character of a fanfaron , or Hector : for with us the knight takes occasion to walk out , or sleep , to avoid the vanity of telling his own story , which the trusty squire is ever to perform for him . So in their love-scenes , of which Eugenius spoke last , the ancients were more hearty , we more talkative : they writ love as it was then the mode to make it ; and I will grant this much to Eugenius , that perhaps one of their poets , had he lived in our age ,</p>
   <p>Si foret hoc nostrum fato delapsus in ævum ,</p>
   <p>as Horace says of Lucilius , he had altered many things ; not that they were not natural before , but that he might accommodate himself to the age in which he lived . Yet in the mean time we are not to conclude any thing rashly against those great men , but preserve to them the dignity of masters , and give that honour to their memories ,— quos Libitina sacravit ,— part of which we expect may be paid to us in future times .</p>
   <p>This moderation of Crites , as it was pleasing to all the company , so it put an end to that dispute ; which Eugenius , who seemed to have the better of the argument , would urge no farther . But Lisideius , after he had acknowledged himself of Eugenius his opinion concerning the ancients , yet told him , he had forborne , till his discourse were ended , to ask him , why he preferred the English plays above those of other nations ? and whether we ought not to submit our stage to the exactness of our next neighbours ?</p>
   <p>Though , said Eugenius , I am at all times ready to defend the honour of my country against the French , and to maintain , we are as well able to vanquish them with our pens , as our ancestors have been with their swords ; yet , if you please , added he , looking upon Neander , I will commit this cause to my friend 's management ; his opinion of our plays is the same with mine : and besides , there is no reason , that Crites and I , who have now left the stage , should re-enter so suddenly upon it ; which is against the laws of comedy .</p>
   <p>If the question had been stated , replied Lisideius , who had writ best , the French or English , forty years ago , I should have been of your opinion , and adjudged the honour to our own nation ; but since that time , ( said he , turning towards Neander ,) we have been so long together bad Englishmen , that we had not leisure to be good poets . Beaumont , Fletcher , and Jonson , ( who were only capable of bringing us to that degree of perfection which we have ,) were just then leaving the world ; as if in an age of so much horror , wit , and those milder studies of humanity , had no farther business among us . But the muses , who ever follow peace , went to plant in another country : it was then that the great Cardinal of Richelieu began to take them into his protection ; and that , by his encouragement , Corneille , and some other Frenchmen , reformed their theatre , which before was as much below ours , as it now surpasses it and the rest of Europe . But because Crites , in his discourse for the ancients , has prevented me , by observing many rules of the stage , which the moderns have borrowed from them , I shall only , in short , demand of you , whether you are not convinced that of all nations the French have best observed them ? In the unity of time you find them so scrupulous , that it yet remains a dispute among their poets , whether the artificial day of twelve hours , more or less , be not meant by Aristotle , rather than the natural one of twenty-four ; and consequently , whether all plays ought not to be reduced into that compass . This I can testify , that in all their dramas writ within these last twenty years and upwards , I have not observed any that have extended the time to thirty hours . In the unity of place they are full as scrupulous ; for many of their critics limit it to that very spot of ground where the play is supposed to begin ; none of them exceed the compass of the same town or city .</p>
   <p>The unity of action in all their plays is yet more conspicuous ; for they do not burden them with under-plots , as the English do : which is the reason why many scenes of our tragi-comedies carry on a design that is nothing of kin to the main plot ; and that we see two distinct webs in a play , like those in ill-wrought stuffs ; and two actions , that is , two plays , carried on together , to the confounding of the audience ; who , before they are warm in their concernments for one part , are diverted to another ; and by that means espouse the interest of neither . From hence likewise it arises , that the one half of our actors are not known to the other . They keep their distances , as if they were Montagues and Capulets , and seldom begin an acquaintance till the last scene of the fifth act , when they are all to meet upon the stage . There is no theatre in the world has any thing so absurd as the English tragi-comedy ; it is a drama of our own invention , and the fashion of it is enough to proclaim it so ; here a course of mirth , there another of sadness and passion , and a third of honour and a duel : thus , in two hours and a half we run through all the fits of Bedlam . The French affords you as much variety on the same day , but they do it not so unseasonably , or mal à propos , as we : our poets present you the play and the farce together ; and our stages still retain somewhat of the original civility of the Red Bull :[ 126 ]</p>
   <p>Atque ursum et pugiles media inter carmina poscunt .</p>
   <p>The end of tragedies or serious plays , says Aristotle , is to beget admiration , compassion , or concernment ; but are not mirth and compassion things incompatible ? and is it not evident , that the poet must of necessity destroy the former by intermingling of the latter ? that is , he must ruin the sole end and object of his tragedy , to introduce somewhat that is forced into it , and is not of the body of it . Would you not think that physician mad , who , having prescribed a purge , should immediately order you to take restringents ?</p>
   <p>But to leave our plays , and return to theirs . I have noted one great advantage they have had in the plotting of their tragedies ; that is , they are always grounded upon some known history : according to that of Horace , Ex noto fictum carmen sequar ; and in that they have so imitated the ancients , that they have surpassed them . For the ancients , as was observed before , took for the foundation of their plays some poetical fiction , such as under that consideration could move but little concernment in the audience , because they already knew the event of it . But the French goes farther :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Atque ita mentitur , sic veris falsa remiscet ,</l>
     <l n="2">Primo ne medium , medio ne discrepet imum .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He so interweaves truth with probable fiction , that he puts a pleasing fallacy upon us , mends the intrigues of fate , and dispenses with the severity of history , to reward that virtue which has been rendered to us there unfortunate . Sometimes the story has left the success so doubtful , that the writer is free , by the privilege of a poet , to take that which of two or more relations will best suit with his design : as for example , in the death of Cyrus , whom Justin and some others report to have perished in the Scythian war , but Xenophon affirms to have died in his bed of extreme old age . Nay more , when the event is past dispute , even then we are willing to be deceived , and the poet , if he contrives it with appearance of truth , has all the audience of his party ; at least during the time his play is acting : so naturally we are kind to virtue , when our own interest is not in question , that we take it up as the general concernment of mankind . On the other side , if you consider the historical plays of Shakespeare , they are rather so many chronicles of kings , or the business many times of thirty or forty years , cramped into a representation of two hours and a half ; which is not to imitate or paint nature , but rather to draw her in miniature , to take her in little ; to look upon her through the wrong end of a perspective , and receive her images not only much less , but infinitely more imperfect than the life : this , instead of making a play delightful , renders it ridiculous :</p>
   <p>Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic , incredulus odi .</p>
   <p>For the spirit of man cannot be satisfied but with truth , or at least verisimility ; and a poem is to contain , if not τὰ ἐτυμα , yet ἐτύμοισιν ὁμοῖα , as one of the Greek poets has expressed it .</p>
   <p>Another thing in which the French differ from us and from the Spaniards , is , that they do not embarrass , or cumber themselves with too much plot ; they only represent so much of a story as will constitute one whole and great action sufficient for a play : we , who undertake more , do but multiply adventures ; which , not being produced from one another , as effects from causes , but barely following , constitute many actions in the drama , and consequently make it many plays .</p>
   <p>But by pursuing closely one argument , which is not cloyed with many turns , the French have gained more liberty for verse , in which they write : they have leisure to dwell on a subject which deserves it ; and to represent the passions , ( which we have acknowledged to be the poet 's work ,) without being hurried from one thing to another , as we are in the plays of Calderon , which we have seen lately upon our theatres , under the name of Spanish plots . I have taken notice but of one tragedy of ours , whose plot has that uniformity and unity of design in it , which I have commended in the French ; and that is “ Rollo ,"[ 127 ] or rather , under the name of Rollo , the story of Bassianus and Geta in Herodian : there indeed the plot is neither large nor intricate , but just enough to fill the minds of the audience , not to cloy them . Besides , you see it founded upon the truth of history ,— only the time of the action is not reduceable to the strictness of the rules ; and you see in some places a little farce mingled , which is below the dignity of the other parts ; and in this all our poets are extremely peccant : even Ben Jonson himself , in “ Sejanus ” and “ Catiline , ” has given us this olio of a play , this unnatural mixture of comedy and tragedy , which to me sounds just as ridiculously as the history of David with the merry humours of Goliah . In “ Sejanus ” you may take notice of the scene betwixt Livia and the physician , which is a pleasant satire upon the artificial helps of beauty : in “ Catiline ” you may see the parliament of women ; the little envies of them to one another ; and all that passes betwixt Curio and Fulvia : scenes admirable in their kind , but of an ill mingle with the rest .</p>
   <p>But I return again to the French writers , who , as I have said , do not burden themselves too much with plot , which has been reproached to them by an ingenious person of our nation<span corresp="#note128" type="note_anchor">[ 128 ]</span>as a fault ; for he says , they commonly make but one person considerable in a play ; they dwell on him , and his concernments , while the rest of the persons are only subservient to set him off . If he intends this by it ,— that there is one person in the play who is of greater dignity than the rest , he must tax , not only theirs , but those of the ancients , and , which he would be loth to do , the best of ours ; for it is impossible but that one person must be more conspicuous in it than any other , and consequently the greatest share in the action must devolve on him . We see it so in the management of all affairs ; even in the most equal aristocracy , the balance cannot be so justly poised , but some one will be superior to the rest , either in parts , fortune , interest , or the consideration of some glorious exploit ; which will reduce the greatest part of business into his hands .</p>
   <p>But , if he would have us to imagine , that in exalting one character the rest of them are neglected , and that all of them have not some share or other in the action of the play , I desire him to produce any of Corneille 's tragedies , wherein every person ( like so many servants in a well-governed family ) has not some employment , and who is not necessary to the carrying on of the plot , or at least to your understanding it .</p>
   <p>There are indeed some protatic persons in the ancients , whom they make use of in their plays , either to hear , or give the relation : but the French avoid this with great address , making their narrations only to , or by such , who are some way interested in the main design . And now I am speaking of relations , I cannot take a fitter opportunity to add this in favour of the French , that they often use them with better judgment and more á propos than the English do . Not that I commend narrations in general ,— but there are two sorts of them ; one , of those things which are antecedent to the play , and are related to make the conduct of it more clear to us ; but it is a fault to chuse such subjects for the stage as will force us on that rock , because we see they are seldom listened to by the audience , and that is many times the ruin of the play ; for , being once let pass without attention , the audience can never recover themselves to understand the plot ; and indeed it is somewhat unreasonable , that they should be put to so much trouble , as , that to comprehend what passes in their sight , they must have recourse to what was done , perhaps , ten or twenty years ago .</p>
   <p>But there is another sort of relations , that is , of things happening in the action of the play , and supposed to be done behind the scenes ; and this is many times both convenient and beautiful : for , by it the French avoid the tumult to which we are subject in England , by representing duels , battles , and the like ; which renders our stage too like the theatres where they fight prizes . For what is more ridiculous than to represent an army with a drum and five men behind it ; all which , the hero of the other side is to drive in before him ? or to see a duel fought , and one slain with two or three thrusts of the foils , which we know are so blunted , that we might give a man an hour to kill another in good earnest with them ?</p>
   <p>I have observed , that in all our tragedies the audience cannot forbear laughing when the actors are to die ; it is the most comic part of the whole play . All passions may be lively represented on the stage , if to the well-writing of them the actor supplies a good commanded voice , and limbs that move easily , and without stiffness ; but there are many actions which can never be imitated to a just height : dying especially is a thing which none but a Roman gladiator could naturally perform on the stage , when he did not imitate , or represent , but do it ; and therefore it is better to omit the representation of it .</p>
   <p>The words of a good writer , which describe it lively , will make a deeper impression of belief in us , than all the actor can insinuate into us , when he seems to fall dead before us ; as a poet in the description of a beautiful garden , or a meadow , will please our imagination more than the place itself can please our sight . When we see death represented , we are convinced it is but fiction ; but when we hear it related , our eyes ( the strongest witnesses ) are wanting , which might have undeceived us ; and we are all willing to favour the slight when the poet does not too grossly impose on us . They , therefore , who imagine these relations would make no concernment in the audience , are deceived , by confounding them with the other , which are of things antecedent to the play : those are made often in cold blood , as I may say , to the audience ; but these are warmed with our concernments , which were before awakened in the play . What the philosophers say of motion , that , when it is once begun , it continues of itself , and will do so to eternity , without some stop put to it , is clearly true on this occasion : the soul , being already moved with the characters and fortunes of those imaginary persons , continues going of its own accord ; and we are no more weary to hear what becomes of them when they are not on the stage , than we are to listen to the news of an absent mistress . But it is objected , that if one part of the play may be related , then why not all ? I answer , some parts of the action are more fit to be represented , some to be related . Corneille says judiciously , that the poet is not obliged to expose to view all particular actions which conduce to the principal : he ought to select such of them to be seen , which will appear with the greatest beauty , either by the magnificence of the show , or the vehemence of passions which they produce , or some other charm which they have in them , and let the rest arrive to the audience by narration . It is a great mistake in us to believe the French present no part of the action on the stage : every alteration or crossing of a design , every new-sprung passion , and turn of it , is a part of the action , and much the noblest , except we conceive nothing to be action till the players come to blows ; as if the painting of the hero 's mind were not more properly the poet 's work , than the strength of his body . Nor does this any thing contradict the opinion of Horace , where he tells us ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem ,</l>
     <l n="2">Quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus .</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>That is , those actions which by reason of their cruelty will cause aversion in us , or by reason of their impossibility , unbelief , ought either wholly to be avoided by a poet , or only delivered by narration . To which we may have leave to add such as , to avoid tumult , ( as was before hinted ,) or to reduce the plot into a more reasonable compass of time , or for defect of beauty in them , are rather to be related than presented to the eye . Examples of all these kinds are frequent , not only among all the ancients , but in the best received of our English poets . We find Ben Jonson using them in his “ Magnetic Lady , ” where one comes out from dinner , and relates the quarrels and disorders of it to save the undecent appearance of them on the stage , and to abbreviate the story : and this in express imitation of Terence , who had done the same before him in his “ Eunuch , ” where Pythias makes the like relation of what had happened within at the Soldier 's entertainment . The relations , likewise , of Sejanus 's death , and the prodigies before it , are remarkable ; the one of which was hid from sight to avoid the horror and tumult of the representation ; the other , to shun the introducing of things impossible to be believed . In that excellent play , “ The King and no King , ” Fletcher goes yet farther ; for the whole unravelling of the plot is done by narration in the fifth act , after the manner of the ancients ; and it moves great concernment in the audience , though it be only a relation of what was done many years before the play . I could multiply other instances , but these are sufficient to prove , that there is no error in chusing a subject which requires this sort of narrations ; in the ill management of them , there may .</p>
   <p>But I find I have been too long in this discourse , since the French have many other excellencies not common to us ; as that you never see any of their plays end with a conversion , or simple change of will , which is the ordinary way which our poets use to end theirs . It shews little art in the conclusion of a dramatic poem , when they who have hindered the felicity during the four acts , desist from it in the fifth , without some powerful cause to take them off their design ; and though I deny not but such reasons may be found , yet it is a path that is cautiously to be trod , and the poet is to be sure he convinces the audience , that the motive is strong enough .<span corresp="#note129" type="note_anchor">[ 129 ]</span>As for example , the conversion of the Usurer in “ The Scornful Lady , ” seems to me a little forced ; for , being an usurer , which implies a lover of money to the highest degree of covetousness , ( and such the poet has represented him ,) the account he gives for the sudden change is , that he has been duped by the wild young fellow ; which in reason might render him more wary another time , and make him punish himself with harder fare and coarser clothes to get up again what he had lost : but that he should look on it as a judgment , and so repent , we may expect to hear in a sermon , but I should never endure it in a play .</p>
   <p>I pass by this ; neither will I insist on the care they take , that no person after his first entrance shall ever appear , but the business which brings him upon the stage shall be evident ; which rule , if observed , must needs render all the events in the play more natural ; for there you see the probability of every accident , in the cause that produced it ; and that which appears chance in the play , will seem so reasonable to you , that you will there find it almost necessary : so that in the exit of the actor you have a clear account of his purpose and design in the next entrance ; ( though , if the scene be well wrought , the event will commonly deceive you ;) for there is nothing so absurd , says Corneille , as for an actor to leave the stage , only because he has no more to say .</p>
   <p>I should now speak of the beauty of their rhyme , and the just reason I have to prefer that way of writing in tragedies before ours in blank-verse ; but because it is partly received by us , and therefore not altogether peculiar to them , I will say no more of it in relation to their plays . For our own , I doubt not but it will exceedingly beautify them ; and I can see but one reason why it should not generally obtain , that is , because our poets write so ill in it . This indeed may prove a more prevailing argument than all others which are used to destroy it , and therefore I am only troubled when great and judicious poets , and those who are acknowledged such , have writ or spoke against it : as for others , they are to be answered by that one sentence of an ancient author :[ 130 ] Sed ut primo ad consequendos eos quos priores ducimus , accendimur , ita ubi aut præteriri , aut æquari eos posse desperavimus , studium cum spe senescit : quod , scilicet , assequi non potest , sequi desinit ;— prœteritoque eo in quo eminere non possumus , aliquid in quo nitamur , conquirimus .</p>
   <p>Lisideius concluded in this manner ; and Neander , after a little pause , thus answered him :</p>
   <p>I shall grant Lisideius , without much dispute , a great part of what he has urged against us ; for I acknowledge , that the French contrive their plots more regularly , and observe the laws of comedy , and decorum of the stage , ( to speak generally ,) with more exactness than the English . Farther , I deny not but he has taxed us justly in some irregularities of ours , which he has mentioned ; yet , after all , I am of opinion , that neither our faults , nor their virtues , are considerable enough to place them above us .</p>
   <p>For the lively imitation of nature being in the definition of a play , those which best fulfil that law , ought to be esteemed superior to the others . ‘ Tis true , those beauties of the French poesy are such as will raise perfection higher where it is , but are not sufficient to give it where it is not : they are indeed the beauties of a statue , but not of a man , because not animated with the soul of poesy , which is imitation of humour and passions : and this Lisideius himself , or any other , however biassed to their party , cannot but acknowledge , if he will either compare the humours of our comedies , or the characters of our serious plays , with theirs . He who will look upon theirs which have been written till these last ten years , or thereabouts , will find it an hard matter to pick out two or three passable humours amongst them . Corneille himself , their arch-poet , what has he produced except “ The Liar , ” and you know how it was cried up in France ; but when it came upon the English stage , though well translated , and that part of Dorant acted<span corresp="#note131" type="note_anchor">[ 131 ]</span>to so much advantage as I am confident it never received in its own country , the most favourable to it would not put it in competition with many of Fletcher 's or Ben Jonson 's . In the rest of Corneille 's comedies you have little humour ; he tells you himself , his way is , first to shew two lovers in good intelligence with each other ; in the working up of the play , to embroil them by some mistake , and in the latter end to clear it , and reconcile them .</p>
   <p>But of late years Moliere , the younger Corneille , Quinault , and some others , have been imitating afar off the quick turns and graces of the English stage . They have mixed their serious plays with mirth , like our tragi-comedies , since the death of Cardinal Richelieu ,<span corresp="#note132" type="note_anchor">[ 132 ]</span>which Lisideius , and many others , not observing , have commended that in them for a virtue , which they themselves no longer practise . Most of their new plays are , like some of ours , derived from the Spanish novels . There is scarce one of them without a veil , and a trusty Diego , who drolls much after the rate of the “ Adventures . "[ 133 ] But their humours , if I may grace them with that name , are so thin sown , that never above one of them comes up in any play . I dare take upon me to find more variety of them in some one play of Ben Jonson 's , than in all theirs together : as he who has seen the “ Alchemist , ” “ The Silent Woman , ” or “ Bartholomew Fair , ” cannot but acknowledge with me .</p>
   <p>I grant the French have performed what was possible on the ground-work of the Spanish plays ; what was pleasant before , they have made regular : but there is not above one good play to be writ on all those plots ; they are too much alike to please often , which we need not the experience of our own stage to justify . As for their new way of mingling mirth with serious plot , I do not , with Lisideius , condemn the thing , though I cannot approve their manner of doing it . He tells us , we cannot so speedily recollect ourselves after a scene of great passion and concernment , as to pass to another of mirth and humour , and to enjoy it with any relish : but why should he imagine the soul of man more heavy than his senses ? Does not the eye pass from an unpleasant object to a pleasant , in a much shorter time than is required to this ? and does not the unpleasantness of the first commend the beauty of the latter ? The old rule of logic might have convinced him , that contraries , when placed near , set off each other . A continued gravity keeps the spirit too much bent ; we must refresh it sometimes , as we bait in a journey , that we may go on with greater ease . A scene of mirth , mixed with tragedy , has the same effect upon us which our music has betwixt the acts ; which we find a relief to us from the best plots and language of the stage , if the discourses have been long . I must therefore have stronger arguments , ere I am convinced that compassion and mirth in the same subject destroy each other ; and in the mean time , cannot but conclude , to the honour of our nation , that we have invented , increased , and perfected , a more pleasant way of writing for the stage , than was ever known to the ancients or moderns of any nation , which is tragi-comedy .</p>
   <p>And this leads me to wonder why Lisideius and many others should cry up the barrenness of the French plots , above the variety and copiousness of the English . Their plots are single , they carry on one design , which is pushed forward by all the actors , every scene in the play contributing and moving towards it . Our plays , besides the main design , have under-plots , or by-concernments , of less considerable persons and intrigues , which are carried on with the motion of the main plot : as they say the orb of the fixed stars , and those of the planets , though they have motions of their own , are whirled about by the motion of the primum mobile , in which they are contained . That similitude expresses much of the English stage ; for if contrary motions may be found in nature to agree ; if a planet can go east and west at the same time ;— one way by virtue of his own motion , the other by the force of the first mover ;— it will not be difficult to imagine how the under-plot , which is only different , not contrary to the great design , may naturally be conducted along with it .</p>
   <p>Eugenius has already shewn us , from the confession of the French poets , that the unity of action is sufficiently preserved , if all the imperfect actions of the play are conducing to the main design ; but when those petty intrigues of a play are so ill ordered , that they have no coherence with the other , I must grant that Lisideius has reason to tax that want of due connection ; for co-ordination in a play is as dangerous and unnatural as in a state . In the mean time he must acknowledge , our variety , if well ordered , will afford a greater pleasure to the audience .</p>
   <p>As for his other argument , that by pursuing one single theme they gain an advantage to express and work up the passions , I wish any example he could bring from them would make it good ; for I confess their verses are to me the coldest I have ever read . Neither , indeed , is it possible for them , in the way they take , so to express passion , as that the effects of it should appear in the concernment of an audience , their speeches being so many declamations , which tire us with the length ; so that instead of persuading us to grieve for their imaginary heroes , we are concerned for our own trouble , as we are in tedious visits of bad company ; we are in pain till they are gone . When the French stage came to be reformed by Cardinal Richelieu , those long harangues were introduced , to comply with the gravity of a churchman . Look upon the “ Cinna ” and the “ Pompey ; ” they are not so properly to be called plays , as long discourses of reason of state ; and “ Polieucte ” in matters of religion is as solemn as the long stops upon our organs . Since that time it is grown into a custom , and their actors speak by the hour-glass , like our parsons ;<span corresp="#note134" type="note_anchor">[ 134 ]</span>nay , they account it the grace of their parts , and think themselves disparaged by the poet , if they may not twice or thrice in a play entertain the audience with a speech of an hundred lines . I deny not but this may suit well enough with the French ; for as we , who are a more sullen people , come to be diverted at our plays , so they , who are of an airy and gay temper , come thither to make themselves more serious : and this I conceive to be one reason , why comedies are more pleasing to us , and tragedies to them . But to speak generally : it cannot be denied , that short speeches and replies are more apt to move the passions , and beget concernment in us , than the other ; for it is unnatural for any one , in a gust of passion , to speak long together ; or for another , in the same condition , to suffer him without interruption . Grief and passion are like floods raised in little brooks by a sudden rain ; they are quickly up , and if the concernment be poured unexpectedly in upon us , it overflows us : But a long sober shower gives them leisure to run out as they came in , without troubling the ordinary current . As for comedy , repartee is one of its chiefest graces ; the greatest pleasure of the audience is a chace of wit , kept up on both sides , and swiftly managed . And this our forefathers , if not we , have had in Fletcher 's plays , to a much higher degree of perfection , than the French poets can reasonably hope to reach .</p>
   <p>There is another part of Lisideius 's discourse , in which he has rather excused our neighbours , than commended them ; that is , for aiming only to make one person considerable in their plays . It is very true what he has urged , that one character in all plays , even without the poet 's care , will have advantage of all the others ; and that the design of the whole drama will chiefly depend on it . But this hinders not that there may be more shining characters in the play : many persons of a second magnitude , nay , some so very near , so almost equal to the first , that greatness may be opposed to greatness , and all the persons be made considerable , not only by their quality , but their action . It is evident , that the more the persons are , the greater will be the variety of the plot . If then the parts are managed so regularly , that the beauty of the whole be kept entire , and that the variety become not a perplexed and confused mass of accidents , you will find it infinitely pleasing to be led in a labyrinth of design , where you see some of your way before you , yet discern not the end till you arrive at it . And that all this is practicable , I can produce for examples many of our English plays : As “ The Maid 's Tragedy , ” “ The Alchemist , ” “ The Silent Woman : ” I was going to have named “ The Fox , ” but that the unity of design seems not exactly observed in it ; for there appear two actions in the play ; the first naturally ending with the fourth act , the second forced from it in the fifth : which yet is the less to be condemned in him , because the disguise of Volpone , though it suited not with his character as a crafty or covetous person , agreed well enough with that of a voluptuary ;<span corresp="#note135" type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span>and by it the poet gained the end at which he aimed , the punishment of vice , and the reward of virtue , both which that disguise produced . So that to judge equally of it , it was an excellent fifth act , but not so naturally proceeding from the former .</p>
   <p>But to leave this , and pass to the latter part of Lisideius 's discourse , which concerns relations , I must acknowledge with him , that the French have reason to hide that part of the action which would occasion too much tumult on the stage , and to chuse rather to have it made known by narration to the audience . Farther , I think it very convenient , for the reasons he has given , that all incredible actions were removed ; but , whether custom has so insinuated itself into our countrymen , or nature has so formed them to fierceness , I know not ; but they will scarcely suffer combats and other objects of horror to be taken from them . And indeed , the indecency of tumults is all which can be objected against fighting : for why may not our imagination as well suffer itself to be deluded with the probability of it , as with any other thing in the play ? For my part , I can with as great ease persuade myself , that the blows are given in good earnest , as I can , that they who strike them are kings or princes , or those persons which they represent . For objects of incredibility ,— I would be satisfied from Lisideius , whether we have any so removed from all appearance of truth , as are those of Corneille 's “ Andromede ; ” a play which has been frequented the most of any he has writ . If the Perseus , or the son of an heathen god , the Pegasus , and the Monster , were not capable to choke a strong belief , let him blame any representation of ours hereafter . Those indeed were objects of delight ; yet the reason is the same as to the probability ; for he makes it not a ballet , or masque , but a play , which is to resemble truth . But for death , that it ought not to be represented , I have , besides the arguments alleged by Lisideius , the authority of Ben Jonson , who has forborne it in his tragedies ; for both the death of Sejanus and Catiline are related ; though , in the latter , I cannot but observe one irregularity of that great poet ; he has removed the scene in the same act , from Rome to Catiline 's army , and from thence again to Rome ; and besides , has allowed a very considerable time after Catiline 's speech , for the striking of the battle , and the return of Petreius , who is to relate the event of it to the senate ; which I should not animadvert on him , who was otherwise a painful observer of τὸ πρεπὸν , or the decorum of the stage , if he had not used extreme severity in his judgment on the incomparable Shakespeare for the same fault .<span corresp="#note136" type="note_anchor">[ 136 ]</span>To conclude on this subject of relations , if we are to be blamed for shewing too much of the action , the French are as faulty for discovering too little of it ; a mean betwixt both should be observed by every judicious writer , so as the audience may neither be left unsatisfied by not seeing what is beautiful , or shocked by beholding what is either incredible or undecent .</p>
   <p>I hope I have already proved in this discourse , that though we are not altogether so punctual as the French , in observing the laws of comedy , yet our errors are so few , and little , and those things wherein we excel them so considerable , that we ought of right to be preferred before them . But what will Lisideius say , if they themselves acknowledge they are too strictly bounded by those laws , for breaking which he has blamed the English ? I will allege Corneille 's words , as I find them in the end of his Discourse of the three Unities : Il est facile aux speculatifs d'estre severes , &amp; c. “ It is easy for speculative persons to judge severely ; but if they would produce to public view ten or twelve pieces of this nature , they would perhaps give more latitude to the rules than I have done , when , by experience , they had known how much we are limited and constrained by them , and how many beauties of the stage they banished from it . ” To illustrate a little what he has said :— by their servile observations of the unities of time and place , and integrity of scenes , they have brought on themselves that dearth of plot , and narrowness of imagination , which may be observed in all their plays . How many beautiful accidents might naturally happen in two or three days , which cannot arrive with any probability in the compass of twenty-four hours ? There is time to be allowed also for maturity of design , which amongst great and prudent persons , such as are often represented in tragedy , cannot , with any likelihood of truth , be brought to pass at so short a warning . Farther , by tying themselves strictly to the unity of place , and unbroken scenes , they are forced many times to omit some beauties which cannot be shewn where the act began ; but might , if the scene were interrupted , and the stage cleared for the persons to enter in another place ; and therefore the French poets are often forced upon absurdities : for if the act begins in a chamber , all the persons in the play must have some business or other to come thither , or else they are not to be shewn that act ; and sometimes their characters are very unfitting to appear there : as suppose it were the king 's bed-chamber , yet the meanest man in the tragedy must come and dispatch his business there , rather than in the lobby , or court-yard , ( which is fitter for him ,) for fear the stage should be cleared , and the scenes broken . Many times they fall by it into a greater inconvenience ; for they keep their scenes unbroken , and yet change the place ; as in one of their newest plays , where the act begins in the street . There a gentleman is to meet his friend ; he sees him with his man , coming out from his father 's house ; they talk together , and the first goes out : the second , who is a lover , has made an appointment with his mistress ; she appears at the window , and then we are to imagine the scene lies under it . This gentleman is called away , and leaves his servant with his mistress : presently her father is heard from within ; the young lady is afraid the serving-man should be discovered , and thrusts him into a place of safety , which is supposed to be her closet . After this , the father enters to the daughter , and now the scene is in a house : for he is seeking from one room to another for this poor Philipin , or French Diego , who is heard from within , drolling and breaking many a miserable conceit on the subject of his sad condition . In this ridiculous manner the play goes forward , the stage being never empty all the while : so that the street , the window , the two houses , and the closet , are made to walk about , and the persons to stand still . Now , what , I beseech you , is more easy than to write a regular French play , or more difficult than to write an irregular English one , like those of Fletcher , or of Shakespeare ?</p>
   <p>If they content themselves , as Corneille did , with some flat design , which , like an ill riddle , is found out ere it be half proposed , such plots we can make every way regular as easily as they ; but whenever they endeavour to rise to any quick turns and counter-turns of plot , as some of them have attempted , since Corneille 's plays have been less in vogue , you see they write as irregularly as we , though they cover it more speciously . Hence the reason is perspicuous , why no French plays , when translated , have , or ever can succeed on the English stage . For , if you consider the plots , our own are fuller of variety ; if the writing , ours are more quick and fuller of spirit ; and therefore ‘ tis a strange mistake in those who decry the way of writing plays in verse , as if the English therein imitated the French . We have borrowed nothing from them ; our plots are weaved in English looms : we endeavour therein to follow the variety and greatness of characters , which are derived to us from Shakespeare and Fletcher ; the copiousness and well-knitting of the intrigues we have from Jonson ; and for the verse itself we have English precedents of elder date than any of Corneille 's plays . Not to name our old comedies before Shakespeare , which were all writ in verse of six feet , or Alexandrines , such as the French now use ,—<span corresp="#note137" type="note_anchor">[ 137 ]</span>I can shew in Shakespeare , many scenes of rhyme together , and the like in Ben Jonson 's tragedies : in “ Catiline ” and “ Sejanus ” sometimes thirty or forty lines ,— I mean besides the chorus , or the monologues ; which , by the way , shewed Ben no enemy to this way of writing , especially if you read his “ Sad Shepherd , ” which goes sometimes on rhyme , sometimes on blank verse , like an horse who eases himself on trot and amble . You find him likewise commending Fletcher 's pastoral of “ The Faithful Shepherdess , ” which is for the most part rhyme , though not refined to that purity to which it hath since been brought . And these examples are enough to clear us from a servile imitation of the French .</p>
   <p>But to return whence I have digressed : I dare boldly affirm these two things of the English drama ;— First , that we have many plays of ours as regular as any of theirs , and which , besides , have more variety of plot and characters ; and , secondly , that in most of the irregular plays of Shakespeare or Fletcher , ( for Ben Jonson 's are for the most part regular ,) there is a more masculine fancy , and greater spirit in the writing , than there is in any of the French . I could produce even in Shakespeare 's and Fletcher 's works , some plays which are almost exactly formed ; as the “ Merry Wives of Windsor , ” and “ The Scornful Lady : ” but , because ( generally speaking ) Shakespeare , who writ first , did not perfectly observe the laws of comedy , and Fletcher , who came nearer to perfection , yet through carelessness made many faults ; I will take the pattern of a perfect play from Ben Jonson , who was a careful and learned observer of the dramatic laws , and from all his comedies I shall select “ The Silent Woman ; ” of which I will make a short examen , according to those rules which the French observe .</p>
   <p>As Neander was beginning to examine “ The Silent Woman , ” Eugenius , earnestly regarding him ; I beseech you , Neander , said he , gratify the company , and me in particular , so far as , before you speak of the play , to give us a character of the author ; and tell us frankly your opinion , whether you do not think all writers , both French and English , ought to give place to him ?</p>
   <p>I fear , replied Neander , that , in obeying your commands , I shall draw some envy on myself . Besides , in performing them , it will be first necessary to speak somewhat of Shakespeare and Fletcher , his rivals in poesy ; and one of them , in my opinion , at least his equal , perhaps his superior .<span corresp="#note138" type="note_anchor">[ 138 ]</span></p>
   <p>To begin then with Shakespeare . He was the man who of all modern , and perhaps ancient poets , had the largest and most comprehensive soul . All the images of nature were still present to him , and he drew them not laboriously , but luckily : when he describes any thing , you more than see it , you feel it too . Those who accuse him to have wanted learning , give him the greater commendation : he was naturally learned ; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature ; he looked inwards , and found her there . I cannot say he is every where alike ; were he so , I should do him injury to compare him with the greatest of mankind . He is many times flat , insipid ; his comic wit degenerating into clenches , his serious swelling into bombast . But he is always great , when some great occasion is presented to him : no man can say , he ever had a fit subject for his wit , and did not then raise himself as high above the rest of poets ,</p>
   <p>Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi .</p>
   <p>The consideration of this made Mr Hales of Eton<span corresp="#note139" type="note_anchor">[ 139 ]</span>say , that there was no subject of which any poet ever writ , but he would produce it much better done in Shakespeare ; and however others are now generally preferred before him , yet the age wherein he lived , which had contemporaries with him , Fletcher and Jonson , never equalled them to him in their esteem : and in the last king 's court , when Ben 's reputation was at highest , Sir John Suckling , and with him the greater part of the courtiers , set our Shakespeare far above him .</p>
   <p>Beaumont and Fletcher , of whom I am next to speak , had , with the advantage of Shakespeare 's wit , which was their precedent , great natural gifts , improved by study ; Beaumont especially being so accurate a judge of plays , that Ben Jonson , while he lived , submitted all his writings to his censure , and ‘ tis thought , used his judgment in correcting , if not contriving , all his plots . What value he had for him , appears by the verses he writ to him ; and therefore I need speak no farther of it . The first play that brought Fletcher and him in esteem , was their “ Philaster ; ” for before that , they had written two or three very unsuccessfully : as the like is reported of Ben Jonson , before he writ “ Every Man in his Humour . ” Their plots were generally more regular than Shakespeare 's , especially those which were made before Beaumont 's death ; and they understood and imitated the conversation of gentlemen much better ; whose wild debaucheries , and quickness of wit in repartees , no poet before them could paint as they have done . Humour ,<span corresp="#note140" type="note_anchor">[ 140 ]</span>which Ben Jonson derived from particular persons , they made it not their business to describe : they represented all the passions very lively , but above all , love . I am apt to believe the English language in them arrived to its highest perfection ; what words have since been taken in , are rather superfluous than ornamental . Their plays are now the most pleasant and frequent entertainments of the stage ; two of theirs being acted through the year for one of Shakespeare 's or Jonson 's : the reason is , because there is a certain gaiety in their comedies , and pathos in their more serious plays , which suits generally with all men 's humours . Shakespeare 's language is likewise a little obsolete , and Ben Jonson 's wit comes short of theirs .</p>
   <p>As for Jonson , to whose character I am now arrived , if we look upon him while he was himself , ( for his last plays were but his dotages ,) I think him the most learned and judicious writer which any theatre ever had . He was a most severe judge of himself , as well as others . One cannot say he wanted wit , but rather that he was frugal of it . In his works you find little to retrench or alter . Wit and language , and humour also in some measure , we had before him ; but something of art was wanting to the drama , till he came . He managed his strength to more advantage than any who preceded him . You seldom find him making love in any of his scenes , or endeavouring to move the passions ; his genius was too sullen and saturnine to do it gracefully , especially when he knew he came after those who had performed both to such an height . Humour was his proper sphere ; and in that he delighted most to represent mechanic people . He was deeply conversant in the ancients , both Greek and Latin , and he borrowed boldly from them : there is scarce a poet or historian among the Roman authors of those times , whom he has not translated in “ Sejanus ” and “ Catiline . ” But he has done his robberies so openly , that one may see he fears not to be taxed by any law . He invades authors like a monarch ; and what would be theft in other poets , is only victory in him . With the spoils of these writers he so represents old Rome to us , in its rites , ceremonies , and customs , that if one of their poets had written either of his tragedies , we had seen less of it than in him . If there was any fault in his language , it was , that he weaved it too closely and laboriously , in his comedies especially : perhaps too , he did a little too much Romanize our tongue , leaving the words which he translated almost as much Latin as he found them : wherein , though he learnedly followed their language , he did not enough comply with the idiom of ours . If I would compare him with Shakespeare , I must acknowledge him the more correct poet , but Shakespeare the greater wit .<span corresp="#note141" type="note_anchor">[ 141 ]</span>Shakespeare was the Homer , or father of our dramatic poets ; Jonson was the Virgil , the pattern of elaborate writing ; I admire him , but I love Shakespeare . To conclude of him ; as he has given us the most correct plays , so in the precepts which he has laid down in his “ Discoveries , ” we have as many and profitable rules for perfecting the stage , as any wherewith the French can furnish us .</p>
   <p>Having thus spoken of the author , I proceed to the examination of his comedy , “ The Silent Woman . ”</p>
   <p>Examen of “ The Silent Woman . ”</p>
   <p>To begin first with the length of the action ; it is so far from exceeding the compass of a natural day , that it takes not up an artificial one . It is all included in the limits of three hours and an half , which is no more than is required for the presentment on the stage : a beauty perhaps not much observed ; if it had , we should not have looked on the Spanish translation of “ Five Hours ” with so much wonder . The scene of it is laid in London ; the latitude of place is almost as little as you can imagine ; for it lies all within the compass of two houses , and after the first act , in one . The continuity of scenes is observed more than in any of our plays , except his own “ Fox ” and “ Alchemist . ” They are not broken above twice , or thrice at most , in the whole comedy ; and in the two best of Corneille 's plays , the “ Cid ” and “ Cinna , ” they are interrupted once . The action of the play is entirely one ; the end or aim of which is the settling Morose 's estate on Dauphine . The intrigue of it is the greatest and most noble of any pure unmixed comedy in any language : you see in it many persons of various characters and humours , and all delightful . As first , Morose , or an old man , to whom all noise , but his own talking , is offensive . Some , who would be thought critics , say this humour of his is forced : but to remove that objection , we may consider him first to be naturally of a delicate hearing , as many are to whom all sharp sounds are unpleasant ; and secondly , we may attribute much of it to the peevishness of his age , or the wayward authority of an old man in his own house , where he may make himself obeyed ; and to this the poet seems to allude in his name Morose . Beside this , I am assured from divers persons , that Ben Jonson was actually acquainted with such a man , one altogether as ridiculous as he is here represented . Others say , it is not enough to find one man of such an humour ; it must be common to more , and the more common the more natural . To prove this , they instance in the best of comical characters , Falstaff . There are many men resembling him ; old , fat , merry , cowardly , drunken , amorous , vain , and lying . But to convince these people , I need but tell them , that humour is the ridiculous extravagance of conversation , wherein one man differs from all others . If then it be common , or communicated to many , how differs it from other men 's ? or what indeed causes it to be ridiculous so much as the singularity of it ? As for Falstaff , he is not properly one humour , but a miscellany of humours or images , drawn from so many several men : that wherein he is singular is his wit , or those things he says , prœter expectatum , unexpected by the audience ; his quick evasions , when you imagine him surprised , which , as they are extremely diverting of themselves , so receive a great addition from his person ; for the very sight of such an unwieldy old debauched fellow is a comedy alone . And here , having a place so proper for it , I cannot but enlarge somewhat upon this subject of humour into which I am fallen . The ancients had little of it in their comedies ; for the τὸ γελοῖον of the old comedy , of which Aristophanes was chief , was not so much to imitate a man , as to make the people laugh at some odd conceit , which had commonly somewhat of unnatural or obscene in it . Thus , when you see Socrates brought upon the stage , you are not to imagine him made ridiculous by the imitation of his actions , but rather by making him perform something very unlike himself : something so childish and absurd , as by comparing it with the gravity of the true Socrates , makes a ridiculous object for the spectators . In their new comedy which succeeded , the poets sought indeed to express the ἦθος , as in their tragedies the πάθος of mankind . But this ἦθος contained only the general characters of men and manners ; as old men , lovers , serving-men , courtezans , parasites , and such other persons as we see in their comedies ; all which they made alike : that is , one old man or father , one lover , one courtezan , so like another , as if the first of them had begot the rest of every sort : Ex homine hunc natum dicas . The same custom they observed likewise in their tragedies . As for the French , though they have the word humeur among them , yet they have small use of it in their comedies , or farces ; they being but ill imitations of the ridiculum , or that which stirred up laughter in the old comedy . But among the English ‘ tis otherwise : where , by humour is meant some extravagant habit , passion , or affection , particular ( as I said before ) to some one person , by the oddness of which , he is immediately distinguished from the rest of men ; which being lively and naturally represented , most frequently begets that malicious pleasure in the audience which is testified by laughter ; as all things which are deviations from customs are ever the aptest to produce it : though by the way this laughter is only accidental , as the person represented is fantastic or bizarre ; but pleasure is essential to it , as the imitation of what is natural . The description of these humours , drawn from the knowledge and observation of particular persons , was the peculiar genius and talent of Ben Jonson ; to whose play I now return .</p>
   <p>Besides Morose , there are at least nine or ten different characters and humours in the “ Silent Woman ; ” all which persons have several concernments of their own , yet are all used by the poet , to the conducting of the main design to perfection . I shall not waste time in commending the writing of this play ; but I will give you my opinion , that there is more wit and acuteness of fancy in it than in any of Ben Jonson 's . Besides , that he has here described the conversation of gentlemen in the persons of True-Wit , and his friends , with more gaiety , air , and freedom , than in the rest of his comedies .<span corresp="#note142" type="note_anchor">[ 142 ]</span>For the contrivance of the plot , ‘ tis extreme , elaborate , and yet withal easy ; for the λύσις , or untying of it , ‘ tis so admirable , that when it is done , no one of the audience would think the poet could have missed it ; and yet it was concealed so much before the last scene , that any other way would sooner have entered into your thoughts . But I dare not take upon me to commend the fabric of it , because it is altogether so full of art , that I must unravel every scene in it to commend it as I ought . And this excellent contrivance is still the more to be admired , because ‘ tis comedy where the persons are only of common rank , and their business private , not elevated by passions or high concernments , as in serious plays . Here every one is a proper judge of all he sees ; nothing is represented but that with which he daily converses : so that by consequence all faults lie open to discovery , and few are pardonable . ‘ Tis this which Horace has judiciously observed :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Creditur , ex medio quia res arcessit , habere</l>
     <l n="2">Sudoris minimum ; sed habet Comedia tanto</l>
     <l n="3">Plus oneris , quanto veniæ minus .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But our poet , who was not ignorant of these difficulties , has made use of all advantages ; as he who designs a large leap , takes his rise from the highest ground . One of these advantages is that which Corneille has laid down as the greatest which can arrive to any poem , and which he himself could never compass above thrice in all his plays ; viz . the making choice of some signal and long-expected day , whereon the action of the play is to depend . This day was that designed by Dauphine for the settling of his uncle 's estate upon him ; which , to compass , he contrives to marry him . That the marriage had been plotted by him long beforehand , is made evident , by what he tells True-Wit in the second act , that in one moment he had destroyed what he had been raising many months .</p>
   <p>There is another artifice of the poet , which I cannot here omit , because by the frequent practice of it in his comedies , he has left it to us almost as a rule ; that is , when he has any character or humour wherein he would shew a coupe de maître , or his highest skill , he recommends it to your observation , by a pleasant description of it before the person first appears . Thus , in “ Bartholomew-Fair , ” he gives you the pictures of Numps and Cokes , and in this , those of Daw , Lafoole , Morose , and the Collegiate Ladies ; all which you hear described before you see them . So that before they come upon the stage , you have a longing expectation of them , which prepares you to receive them favourably ; and when they are there , even from their first appearance you are so far acquainted with them , that nothing of their humour is lost to you .</p>
   <p>I will observe yet one thing further of this admirable plot ; the business of it rises in every act . The second is greater than the first ; the third than the second ; and so forward to the fifth . There too you see , till the very last scene , new difficulties arising to obstruct the action of the play ; and when the audience is brought into despair that the business can naturally be effected , then , and not before , the discovery is made . But that the poet might entertain you with more variety all this while , he reserves some new characters to shew you , which he opens not till the second and third act . In the second , Morose , Daw , the Barber , and Otter ; in the third , the Collegiate Ladies ; all which he moves afterwards in by-walks , or under-plots , as diversions to the main design , lest it should grow tedious , though they are still naturally joined with it , and somewhere or other subservient to it . Thus , like a skilful chess-player , by little and little he draws out his men , and makes his pawns of use to his greater persons .</p>
   <p>If this comedy , and some others of his , were translated into French prose , ( which would now be no wonder to them , since Moliere has lately given them plays out of verse , which have not displeased them ,) I believe the controversy would soon be decided betwixt the two nations , even making them the judges .<span corresp="#note143" type="note_anchor">[ 143 ]</span>But we need not call our heroes to our aid ; be it spoken to the honour of the English , our nation can never want in any age such , who are able to dispute the empire of wit with any people in the universe . And though the fury of a civil war , and power , for twenty years together , abandoned to a barbarous race of men , enemies of all good learning , had buried the muses under the ruins of monarchy ; yet , with the restoration of our happiness , we see revived poesy lifting up its head , and already shaking off the rubbish which lay so heavy on it . We have seen since his majesty 's return , many dramatic poems which yield not to those of any foreign nation , and which deserve all laurels but the English . I will set aside flattery and envy ; it cannot be denied but we have had some little blemish either in the plot or writing of all those plays which have been made within these seven years ; and perhaps there is no nation in the world so quick to discern them , or so difficult to pardon them , as ours : yet if we can persuade ourselves to use the candour of that poet , who , though the most severe of critics , has left us this caution by which to moderate our censures —</p>
   <p>—— ubi plura nitent in carmine , non ego paucis Offendar maculis ;——</p>
   <p>if , in consideration of their many and great beauties , we can wink at some slight and little imperfections , if we , I say , can be thus equal to ourselves , I ask no favour from the French . And if I do not venture upon any particular judgment of our late plays , ‘ tis out of the consideration which an ancient writer gives me : vivorum , ut magna admiratio , ita censura difficilis : betwixt the extremes of admiration and malice , ‘ tis hard to judge uprightly of the living . Only I think it may be permitted me to say , that as it is no lessening to us to yield to some plays , and those not many , of our own nation , in the last age , so can it be no addition to pronounce of our present poets , that they have far surpassed all the ancients , and the modern writers of other countries .</p>
   <p>This was the substance of what was then spoke on that occasion ; and Lisideius , I think , was going to reply , when he was prevented thus by Crites :— I am confident , said he , that the most material things that can be said , have been already urged on either side ; if they have not , I must beg of Lisideius , that he will defer his answer till another time : for I confess I have a joint quarrel to you both , because you have concluded , without any reason given for it , that rhyme is proper for the stage . I will not dispute how ancient it hath been among us to write this way ; perhaps our ancestors knew no better till Shakespeare 's time . I will grant it was not altogether left by him , and that Fletcher and Ben Jonson used it frequently in their pastorals , and sometimes in other plays . Farther , I will not argue whether we received it originally from our own countrymen , or from the French ; for that is an inquiry of as little benefit as theirs , who , in the midst of the late plague , were not so solicitous to provide against it , as to know whether we had it from the malignity of our own air , or by transportation from Holland . I have therefore only to affirm , that it is not allowable in serious plays ; for comedies , I find you already concluding with me . To prove this , I might satisfy myself to tell you , how much in vain it is for you to strive against the stream of the people 's inclination ; the greatest part of which are prepossessed so much with those excellent plays of Shakespeare , Fletcher , and Ben Jonson , which have been written out of rhyme , that except you could bring them such as were written better in it , and those too by persons of equal reputation with them , it will be impossible for you to gain your cause with them , who will still be judges . This it is to which , in fine , all your reasons must submit . The unanimous consent of an audience is so powerful , that even Julius Cæsar , ( as Macrobius reports of him ,) when he was perpetual dictator , was not able to balance it on the other side ; but when Laberius , a Roman knight , at his request contended in the Mime with another poet , he was forced to cry out , Etiam favente me victus es , Laberi . But I will not , on this occasion , take the advantage of the greater number , but only urge such reasons against rhyme , as I find in the writings of those who have argued for the other way . First then , I am of opinion , that rhyme is unnatural in a play , because dialogue there is presented as the effect of sudden thought .<span corresp="#note144" type="note_anchor">[ 144 ]</span>For a play is the imitation of nature ; and since no man , without premeditation , speaks in rhyme , neither ought he to do it on the stage . This hinders not but the fancy may be there elevated to an higher pitch of thought than it is in ordinary discourse ; for there is a probability that men of excellent and quick parts may speak noble things extempore : but those thoughts are never fettered with numbers , or sound of verse , without study ; and therefore it cannot be but unnatural to present the most free way of speaking in that which is the most constrained . For this reason , says Aristotle , ‘ tis best to write tragedy in that kind of verse which is the least such , or which is nearest prose : and this amongst the ancients was the iambic , and with us is blank verse , or the measure of verse kept exactly without rhyme . These numbers therefore are fittest for a play ; the others for a paper of verses , or a poem ; blank verse being as much below them , as rhyme is improper for the drama . And if it be objected , that neither are blank verses made extempore , yet , as nearest nature , they are still to be preferred . But there are two particular exceptions , which many besides myself have had to verse ; by which it will appear yet more plainly , how improper it is in plays . And the first of them is grounded on that very reason for which some have commended rhyme ; they say , the quickness of repartees in argumentative scenes receives an ornament from verse . Now what is more unreasonable than to imagine , that a man should not only light upon the wit , but the rhyme too , upon the sudden ? This nicking of him who spoke before both in sound and measure , is so great an happiness , that you must at least suppose the persons of your play to be born poets : Arcades omnes , et cantare pares , et respondere parati ; they must have arrived to the degree of quicquid conabar dicere , to make verses almost whether they will or no . If they are any thing below this , it will look rather like the design of two , than the answer of one : it will appear that your actors hold intelligence together ; that they perform their tricks like fortune-tellers , by confederacy . The hand of art will be too visible in it , against that maxim of all professions — Ars est celare artem ; that it is the greatest perfection of art to keep itself undiscovered . Nor will it serve you to object , that however you manage it , ‘ tis still known to be a play ; and consequently , the dialogue of two persons , understood to be the labour of one poet . For a play is still an imitation of nature ; we know we are to be deceived , and we desire to be so ; but no man ever was deceived but with a probability of truth ; for who will suffer a gross lie to be fastened on him ? Thus we sufficiently understand , that the scenes which represent cities and countries to us , are not really such , but only painted on boards and canvass ; but shall that excuse the ill painture or designment of them ? Nay , rather ought they not to be laboured with so much the more diligence and exactness , to help the imagination ? since the mind of man does naturally tend to truth ; and therefore the nearer any thing comes to the imitation of it , the more it pleases .</p>
   <p>Thus , you see , your rhyme is uncapable of expressing the greatest thoughts naturally , and the lowest it cannot with any grace : for what is more unbefitting the majesty of verse , than to call a servant , or bid a door be shut in rhyme ? and yet you are often forced on this miserable necessity . But verse , you say , circumscribes a quick and luxuriant fancy , which would extend itself too far on every subject , did not the labour which is required to well turned and polished rhyme , set bounds to it . Yet this argument , if granted , would only prove , that we may write better in verse , but not more naturally . Neither is it able to evince that ; for he who wants judgment to confine his fancy in blank verse , may want it as much in rhyme ; and he who has it , will avoid errors in both kinds . Latin verse was as great a confinement to the imagination of those poets , as rhyme to ours : and yet you find Ovid saying too much on every subject . Nescivit ( says Seneca ) quod bene cessit relinquere ; of which he gives you one famous instance in his description of the deluge :</p>
   <p>Omnia pontus erat , deerant quoque litora ponto .</p>
   <p>Now all was sea , nor had that sea a shore .</p>
   <p>Thus Ovid 's fancy was not limited by verse , and Virgil needed not verse to have bounded his .</p>
   <p>In our own language we see Ben Jonson confining himself to what ought to be said , even in the liberty of blank verse ; and yet Corneille , the most judicious of the French poets , is still varying the same sense an hundred ways , and dwelling eternally on the same subject , though confined by rhyme . Some other exceptions I have to verse ; but since these I have named are for the most part already public , I conceive it reasonable they should first be answered .</p>
   <p>It concerns me less than any , said Neander , ( seeing he had ended ,) to reply to this discourse ; because when I should have proved , that verse may be natural in plays , yet I should always be ready to confess , that those which I have written in this kind come short of that perfection which is required .<span corresp="#note145" type="note_anchor">[ 145 ]</span>Yet since you are pleased I should undertake this province , I will do it , though with all imaginable respect and deference , both to that person from whom you have borrowed your strongest arguments , and to whose judgment , when I have said all , I finally submit . But before I proceed to answer your objections , I must first remember you , that I exclude all comedy from my defence ; and next , that I deny not but blank verse may be also used , and content myself only to assert , that in serious plays , where the subject and characters are great , and the plot unmixed with mirth , which might allay or divert these concernments which are produced , rhyme is there as natural , and more effectual , than blank verse .</p>
   <p>And now having laid down this as a foundation ,— to begin with Crites ,— I must crave leave to tell him , that some of his arguments against rhyme reach no farther than , from the faults or defects of ill rhyme , to conclude against the use of it in general . May not I conclude against blank verse by the same reason ? If the words of some poets , who write in it , are either ill chosen , or ill placed , ( which makes not only rhyme , but all kind of verse in any language unnatural ,) shall I , for their vicious affectation , condemn those excellent lines of Fletcher , which are written in that kind ? Is there any thing in rhyme more constrained than this line in blank verse ?—</p>
   <p>I heaven invoke , and strong resistance make ;</p>
   <p>where you see both the clauses are placed unnaturally ; that is , contrary to the common way of speaking , and that without the excuse of a rhyme to cause it : yet you would think me very ridiculous , if I should accuse the stubbornness of blank verse for this , and not rather the stiffness of the poet . Therefore , Crites , you must either prove , that words , though well chosen , and duly placed , yet render not rhyme natural in itself ; or that however natural and easy the rhyme may be , yet it is not proper for a play . If you insist on the former part , I would ask you , what other conditions are required to make rhyme natural in itself , besides an election of apt words , and a right disposition of them ? For the due choice of your words expresses your sense naturally , and the due placing them adapts the rhyme to it . If you object , that one verse may be made for the sake of another , though both the words and rhyme be apt , I answer , it cannot possibly so fall out ; for either there is a dependance of sense betwixt the first line and the second , or there is none : if there be that connection , then in the natural position of the words the latter line must of necessity flow from the former ; if there be no dependance , yet still the due ordering of words makes the last line as natural in itself as the other : so that the necessity of a rhyme never forces any but bad or lazy writers to say what they would not otherwise . ‘ Tis true , there is both care and art required to write in verse . A good poet never establishes the first line , till he has sought out such a rhyme as may fit the sense , already prepared to heighten the second : many times the close of the sense falls into the middle of the next verse , or farther off , and he may often avail himself of the same advantages in English which Virgil had in Latin ,— he may break off in the hemistick , and begin another line . Indeed , the not observing these two last things , makes plays which are writ in verse so tedious : for though , most commonly , the sense is to be confined to the couplet , yet nothing that does perpetuo tenore fluere , run in the same channel , can please always . ‘ Tis like the murmuring of a stream , which , not varying in the fall , causes at first attention , at last drowsiness . Variety of cadences is the best rule ; the greatest help to the actors , and refreshment to the audience .</p>
   <p>If then verse may be made natural in itself , how becomes it unnatural in a play ? You say the stage is the representation of nature , and no man in ordinary conversation speaks in rhyme . But you foresaw , when you said this , that it might be answered — neither does any man speak in blank verse , or in measure without rhyme . Therefore you concluded , that which is nearest nature is still to be preferred . But you took no notice , that rhyme might be made as natural as blank verse , by the well placing of the words , &amp; c. All the difference between them , when they are both correct , is the sound in one , which the other wants ; and if so , the sweetness of it , and all the advantage resulting from it , which are handled in the preface to the “ Rival Ladies , ” will yet stand good . As for that place of Aristotle , where he says plays should be writ in that kind of verse which is nearest prose , it makes little for you ; blank verse being properly but measured prose . Now measure alone , in any modern language , does not constitute verse ; those of the ancients in Greek and Latin consisted in quantity of words , and a determinate number of feet . But when , by the inundation of the Goths and Vandals into Italy , new languages were introduced , and barbarously mingled with the Latin , of which the Italian , Spanish , French , and ours , ( made out of them and the Teutonic ,) are dialects , a new way of poesy was practised ; new , I say , in those countries , for in all probability it was that of the conquerors in their own nations : at least we are able to prove , that the eastern people have used it from all antiquity .<span corresp="#note146" type="note_anchor">[ 146 ]</span>This new way consisted in measure or number of feet , and rhyme . The sweetness of rhyme , and observation of accent , supplying the place of quantity in words , which could neither exactly be observed by those barbarians , who knew not the rules of it , neither was it suitable to their tongues as it had been to the Greek and Latin . No man is tied in modern poesy to observe any farther rule in the feet of his verse , but that they be dissyllables ; whether Spondee , Trochee , or Iambic , it matters not ; only he is obliged to rhyme : neither do the Spanish , French , Italian , or Germans , acknowledge at all , or very rarely , any such kind of poesy as blank verse amongst them . Therefore , at most ‘ tis but a poetic prose , a sermo pedestris ; and , as such , most fit for comedies , where I acknowledge rhyme to be improper . Farther , as to that quotation of Aristotle , our couplet verses may be rendered as near prose as blank verse itself , by using those advantages I lately named ,— as breaks in an hemistick , or running the sense into another line ,— thereby making art and order appear as loose and free as nature : or not tying ourselves to couplets strictly , we may use the benefit of the Pindaric way , practised in the “ Siege of Rhodes ; ” where the numbers vary , and the rhyme is disposed carelessly , and far from often chyming . Neither is that other advantage of the ancients to be despised , of changing the kind of verse when they please , with the change of the scene , or some new entrance ; for they confine not themselves always to iambics , but extend their liberty to all lyric numbers , and sometimes even to hexameter . But I need not go so far to prove , that rhyme , as it succeeds to all other offices of Greek and Latin verse , so especially to this of plays , since the custom of nations at this day confirms it ; the French , Italian , and Spanish tragedies are generally writ in it ; and sure the universal consent of the most civilized parts of the world , ought in this , as it doth in other customs , to include the rest .</p>
   <p>But perhaps you may tell me , I have proposed such a way to make rhyme natural , and consequently proper to plays , as is unpracticable ; and that I shall scarce find six or eight lines together in any play , where the words are so placed and chosen as is required to make it natural . I answer , no poet need constrain himself at all times to it . It is enough he makes it his general rule ; for I deny not but sometimes there may be a greatness in placing the words otherwise ; and sometimes they may sound better ; sometimes also the variety itself is excuse enough . But if , for the most part , the words be placed as they are in the negligence of prose , it is sufficient to denominate the way practicable ; for we esteem that to be such , which in the trial oftener succeeds than misses . And thus far you may find the practice made good in many plays : where you do not , remember still , that if you cannot find six natural rhymes together , it will be as hard for you to produce as many lines in blank verse , even among the greatest of our poets , against which I cannot make some reasonable exception .</p>
   <p>And this , sir , calls to my remembrance the beginning of your discourse , where you told us we should never find the audience favourable to this kind of writing , till we could produce as good plays in rhyme , as Ben Jonson , Fletcher , and Shakespeare , had writ out of it . But it is to raise envy to the living , to compare them with the dead . They are honoured , and almost adored by us , as they deserve ; neither do I know any so presumptuous of themselves as to contend with them . Yet give me leave to say thus much , without injury to their ashes , that not only we shall never equal them , but they could never equal themselves , were they to rise and write again . We acknowledge them our fathers in wit , but they have ruined their estates themselves , before they came to their children 's hands . There is scarce an humour , a character , or any kind of plot , which they have not used . All comes sullied or wasted to us : and were they to entertain this age , they could not now make so plenteous treatments out of such decayed fortunes . This therefore will be a good argument to us either not to write at all , or to attempt some other way . There is no bays to be expected in their walks : tentanda via est , quâ me quoque possum tollere humo .</p>
   <p>This way of writing in verse , they have only left free to us ; our age is arrived to a perfection in it , which they never knew ; and which ( if we may guess by what of theirs we have seen in verse , as the “ Faithful Shepherdess , ” and “ Sad Shepherd ” ) it is probable they never could have reached . For the genius of every age is different ; and though ours excel in this , I deny not but that to imitate nature in that perfection which they did in prose , is a greater commendation than to write in verse exactly . As for what you have added ,— that the people are not generally inclined to like this way ,— if it were true , it would be no wonder , that betwixt the shaking off an old habit , and the introducing of a new , there should be difficulty . Do we not see them stick to Hopkins and Sternhold 's Psalms , and forsake those of David , I mean Sandys his translation of them ? If by the people you understand the multitude , the ὁι πολλοὶ , it is no matter what they think ; they are sometimes in the right , sometimes in the wrong : their judgment is a mere lottery . Est ubi plebs recté putat , est ubi peccat .<span corresp="#note147" type="note_anchor">[ 147 ]</span>Horace says it of the vulgar , judging poesy . But if you mean the mixed audience of the populace and the noblesse , I dare confidently affirm , that a great part of the latter sort are already favourable to verse ; and that no serious plays , written since the king 's return , have been more kindly received by them , than “ The Siege of Rhodes , ” the “ Mustapha , ” “ The Indian Queen , ” and “ Indian Emperor . "[ 148 ]</p>
   <p>But I come now to the inference of your first argument . You said , that the dialogue of plays is presented as the effect of sudden thought , but no man speaks suddenly , or extempore , in rhyme ; and you inferred from thence , that rhyme , which you acknowledge to be proper to epic poesy , cannot equally be proper to dramatic , unless we could suppose all men born so much more than poets , that verses should be made in them , not by them .</p>
   <p>It has been formerly urged by you , and confessed by me , that since no man spoke any kind of verse extempore , that which was nearest nature was to be preferred . I answer you , therefore , by distinguishing betwixt what is nearest to the nature of comedy , which is the imitation of common persons and ordinary speaking , and what is nearest the nature of a serious play : this last is indeed the representation of nature , but ‘ tis nature wrought up to an higher pitch . The plot , the characters , the wit , the passions , the descriptions , are all exalted above the level of common converse , as high as the imagination of the poet can carry them , with proportion to verisimility . Tragedy , we know , is wont to image to us the minds and fortunes of noble persons , and to pourtray these exactly ; heroic rhyme is nearest nature , as being the noblest kind of modern verse .</p>

   <p>Blank verse is acknowledged to be too low for a poem , nay more , for a paper of verses ; but if too low for an ordinary sonnet , how much more for tragedy , which is by Aristotle , in the dispute betwixt the epic poesy and the dramatic , for many reasons he there alleges , ranked above it ?</p>
   <p>But setting this defence aside , your argument is almost as strong against the use of rhyme in poems as in plays ; for the epic way is every where interlaced with dialogue , or discoursive scenes ; and therefore you must either grant rhyme to be improper there , which is contrary to your assertion , or admit it into plays by the same title which you have given it to poems . For though tragedy be justly preferred above the other , yet there is a great affinity between them , as may easily be discovered in that definition of a play which Lisideius gave us . The genus of them is the same ,— a just and lively image of human nature , in its actions , passions , and traverses of fortune : so is the end ,— namely for the delight and benefit of mankind . The characters and persons are still the same , viz . the greatest of both sorts ; only the manner of acquainting us with those actions , passions , and fortunes , is different . Tragedy performs it viva voce , or by action , in dialogue ; wherein it excels the epic poem , which does it chiefly by narration , and therefore is not so lively an image of human nature . However , the agreement betwixt them is such , that if rhyme be proper for one , it must be for the other . Verse , ‘ tis true , is not the effect of sudden thought ; but this hinders not that sudden thought may be represented in verse , since those thoughts are such as must be higher than nature can raise them without premeditation , especially to a continuance of them , even out of verse ; and consequently you cannot imagine them to have been sudden either in the poet , or the actors . A play , as I have said , to be like nature , is to be set above it ; as statues which are placed on high are made greater than the life , that they may descend to the sight in their just proportion .</p>
   <p>Perhaps I have insisted too long on this objection ; but the clearing of it will make my stay shorter on the rest . You tell us , Crites , that rhyme appears most unnatural in repartees , or short replies : when he who answers , ( it being presumed he knew not what the other would say , yet ) makes up that part of the verse which was left incomplete , and supplies both the sound and measure of it . This , you say , looks rather like the confederacy of two , than the answer of one .</p>
   <p>This , I confess , is an objection which is in every man 's mouth , who loves not rhyme : but suppose , I beseech you , the repartee were made only in blank verse , might not part of the same argument be turned against you ? for the measure is as often supplied there as it is in rhyme ; the latter half of the hemistick as commonly made up , or a second line subjoined , as a reply to the former ; which any one leaf in Jonson 's plays will sufficiently clear to you . You will often find in the Greek tragedians , and in Seneca , that when a scene grows up into the warmth of repartees , ( which is the close fighting of it ,) the latter part of the trimeter is supplied by him who answers ; and yet it was never observed as a fault in them by any of the ancient or modern critics .<span corresp="#note149" type="note_anchor">[ 149 ]</span>The case is the same in our verse as it was in theirs ; rhyme to us being in lieu of quantity to them . But if no latitude is to be allowed a poet , you take from him not only his licence of quidlibet audendi , but you tie him up in a straiter compass than you would a philosopher . This is indeed Musas colere severiores . You would have him follow nature , but he must follow her on foot : you have dismounted him from his Pegasus . But you tell us , this supplying the last half of a verse , or adjoining a whole second to the former , looks more like the design of two , than the answer of one . Suppose we acknowledge it : How comes this confederacy to be more displeasing to you than in a dance which is well contrived ? You see there the united design of many persons to make up one figure : after they have separated themselves in many petty divisions , they rejoin one by one into a gross : the confederacy is plain amongst them , for chance could never produce any thing so beautiful ; and yet there is nothing in it that shocks your sight . I acknowledge the hand of art appears in repartee , as of necessity it must in all kind of verse . But there is also the quick and poignant brevity of it ( which is an high imitation of nature in those sudden gusts of passion ) to mingle with it ; and this , joined with the cadency and sweetness of the rhyme , leaves nothing in the soul of the hearer to desire . It is an art which appears ; but it appears only like the shadowings of painture , which being to cause the rounding of it , cannot be absent ; but while that is considered , they are lost : so while we attend to the other beauties of the matter , the care and labour of the rhyme is carried from us , or at least drowned in its own sweetness , as bees are sometimes buried in their honey . When a poet has found the repartee , the last perfection he can add to it , is , to put it into verse . However good the thought may be , however apt the words in which it is couched , yet he finds himself at a little unrest , while rhyme is wanting . He cannot leave it till that comes naturally , and then is at ease , and sits down contented .</p>
   <p>From replies , which are the most elevated thoughts of verse , you pass to those which are most mean , and which are common with this lowest of household conversation . In these , you say , the majesty of verse suffers . You instance in the calling of a servant , or commanding a door to be shut , in rhyme . This , Crites , is a good observation of yours , but no argument : for it proves no more but that such thoughts should be waved , as often as may be , by the address of the poet . But suppose they are necessary in the places where he uses them , yet there is no need to put them into rhyme . He may place them in the beginning of a verse , and break it off , as unfit , when so debased , for any other use ; or granting the worst ,— that they require more room than the hemistick will allow , yet still there is a choice to be made of the best words , and least vulgar , provided they be apt to express such thoughts . Many have blamed rhyme in general , for this fault , when the poet , with a little care , might have redressed it . But they do it with no more justice , than if English poesy should be made ridiculous for the sake of the Water-poet 's rhymes .<span corresp="#note150" type="note_anchor">[ 150 ]</span>Our language is noble , full , and significant ; and I know not why he who is master of it may not clothe ordinary things in it as decently as the Latin , if he use the same diligence in his choice of words :</p>
   <p>Delectus verborum origo est eloquentiæ .</p>
   <p>It was the saying of Julius Cæsar , one so curious in his , that none of them can be changed but for a worse . One would think , unlock the door , was a thing as vulgar as could be spoken ; and yet Seneca could make it sound high and lofty in his Latin :—</p>
   <p>Reserate clusos regii postes laris .<span corresp="#note151" type="note_anchor">[ 151 ]</span></p>
   <p>Set wide the palace gates .</p>
   <p>But I turn from this exception , both because it happens not above twice or thrice in any play that those vulgar thoughts are used ; and then too , were there no other apology to be made , yet the necessity of them , which is alike in all kind of writing , may excuse them . For if they are little and mean in rhyme , they are of consequence such in blank verse . Besides that the great eagerness and precipitation with which they are spoken , makes us rather mind the substance than the dress ; that for which they are spoken , rather than what is spoke . For they are always the effect of some hasty concernment , and something of consequence depends on them .</p>
   <p>Thus , Crites , I have endeavoured to answer your objections : it remains only that I should vindicate an argument for verse , which you have gone about to overthrow . It had formerly been said , that the easiness of blank verse renders the poet too luxuriant ; but that the labour of rhyme bounds and circumscribes an over-fruitful fancy ; the sense there being commonly confined to the couplet , and the words so ordered , that the rhyme naturally follows them , not they the rhyme . To this you answered , that it was no argument to the question in hand ; for the dispute was not which way a man may write best , but which is most proper for the subject on which he writes .</p>
   <p>First , give me leave , sir , to remember you , that the argument against which you raised this objection , was only secondary : it was built on this hypothesis ,— that to write in verse was proper for serious plays . Which supposition being granted , ( as it was briefly made out in that discourse , by shewing how verse might be made natural ,) it asserted , that this way of writing was an help to the poet 's judgment , by putting bounds to a wild overflowing fancy . I think therefore it will not be hard for me to make good what it was to prove on that supposition . But you add , that were this let pass , yet he who wants judgment in the liberty of his fancy , may as well shew the defect of it when he is confined to verse ; for he who has judgment will avoid errors , and he who has it not , will commit them in all kinds of writing .</p>
   <p>This argument , as you have taken it from a most acute person ,<span corresp="#note152" type="note_anchor">[ 152 ]</span>so , I confess , it carries much weight in it : but by using the word judgment here indefinitely , you seem to have put a fallacy upon us . I grant , he who has judgment , that is , so profound , so strong , or rather so infallible a judgment , that he needs no helps to keep it always poised and upright , will commit no faults either in rhyme , or out of it . And on the other extreme , he who has a judgment so weak and crazed , that no helps can correct or amend it , shall write scurvily out of rhyme , and worse in it . But the first of these judgments is no where to be found , and the latter is not fit to write at all . To speak therefore of judgment as it is in the best poets ; they who have the greatest proportion of it , want other helps than from it , within . As for example , you would be loth to say , that he who is endued with a sound judgment , has no need of history , geography , or moral philosophy , to write correctly . Judgment is indeed the master-workman in a play ; but he requires many subordinate hands , many tools to his assistance . And verse I affirm to be one of these : it is a rule and line by which he keeps his building compact and even , which otherwise lawless imagination would raise either irregularly or loosely ; at least , if the poet commits errors with this help , he would make greater and more without it :— it is , in short , a slow and painful , but the surest kind of working . Ovid , whom you accuse for luxuriancy in verse , had perhaps been farther guilty of it , had he writ in prose . And for your instance of Ben Jonson , who , you say , writ exactly without the help of rhyme ; you are to remember , it is only an aid to a luxuriant fancy , which his was not : as he did not want imagination , so none ever said he had much to spare . Neither was verse then refined so much , to be an help to that age , as it is to ours . Thus then the second thoughts being usually the best , as receiving the maturest digestion from judgment , and the last and most mature product of those thoughts being artful and laboured verse , it may well be inferred , that verse is a great help to a luxuriant fancy ; and this is what that argument which you opposed was to evince .</p>
   <p>Neander was pursuing this discourse so eagerly , that Eugenius had called to him twice or thrice , ere he took notice that the barge stood still , and that they were at the foot of Somerset-stairs , where they had appointed it to land . The company were all sorry to separate so soon , though a great part of the evening was already spent ; and stood awhile looking back on the water , upon which the moon-beams played , and made it appear like floating quicksilver : at last they went up through a crowd of French people ,<span corresp="#note153" type="note_anchor">[ 153 ]</span>who were merrily dancing in the open air , and nothing concerned for the noise of guns , which had alarmed the town that afternoon . Walking thence together to the Piazze , they parted there ; Eugenius and Lisideius to some pleasant appointment they had made , and Crites and Neander to their several lodgings .</p>

He observes , that the subjects of the ancients were usually the most known stories and fables ; a circumstance which led them to compose their plays rather of speeches and chorus 's , than of scenic action , and representation : Because , “ Seneca making choice of Medea , Hippolytus , and Hercules Œtus , it was impossible to show Medea throwing the mangled limbs of Jason into her age-renewing kettle , or to present the scattered limbs of Hippolytus upon the stage , or show Hercules burning upon his own funeral pile . ”</note>

   <note xml:id="note137" place="bottom" n="137">Our old poets saw something peculiarly ludicrous in the anapoestic canter of these doggrel Alexandrines . The old comedy of “ Gammer Gurton 's Needle ” is composed entirely of them . Shakespeare often uses them where the dialogue is carried on by his clowns , or comic characters ; as in “ Love 's Labour 's Lost , ” act III . ; in most of the quaint skirmishes of wit and punning , in the “ Comedy of Errors ; ” and in the “ Taming of the Shrew . ” Other examples from low comedy of that early age are given in Reed 's edition of Shakespeare , Vol . xx . p. 462 . After all , this same Alexandrine is only the common ballad-stanza of “ Chevy Chace , ” written in two lines at length , instead of being subdivided into four .

The enemies of Shakespeare would by no means yield him so much excellence ; so that it came to a resolution of a trial of skill upon that subject . The place agreed on for the dispute , was Mr Hales 's chamber at Eton . A great many books were sent down by the enemies of this poet ; and on the appointed day , my Lord Falkland , Sir John Suckling , and all the persons of quality that had wit and learning , and interested themselves in the quarrel , met there ; and upon a thorough disquisition of the point , the judges chosen by agreement out of this learned and ingenious assembly , unanimously gave the preference to Shakespeare ; and the Greek and Roman poets were adjudged to veil at least their glory in that to the English hero . ” GILDON 'S Essays .</note>

   <note xml:id="note144" place="bottom" n="144">The reasons against rhyme ,— and very weighty our author at last found them ,— are taken from the Preface to Sir Robert Howard 's plays , the Crites of the dialogue .</note>
   <p>“ Another way of the ancients , which the French follow , and our stage has now lately practised , is , to write in rhyme ; and this is the dispute betwixt many ingenious persons , whether verse in rhyme , or verse without the sound , which may be called blank verse , ( though a hard expression ,) is to be preferred . But take the question largely , and it is never to be decided ; but , by right application , I suppose it may ; for in the general , they are both proper , that is , one for a play , the other for a poem or copy of verses ; a blank verse being as much too low for one , as rhyme is unnatural for the other . A poem , being a premeditated form of thoughts upon designed occasions , ought not to be unfurnished of any harmony in words or sound ; the other is presented as the present effect of accidents not thought of : so that it is impossible it should be equally proper to both these , unless it were possible that all persons were born so much more than poets , that verses were not to be composed by them , but already made in them . Some may object , that this argument is trivial , because , whatever is shewed , it is known still to be but a play ; but such may as well excuse an ill scene , that is not naturally painted , because they know it is only a scene , and not really a city or country .</p>
   <p>“ But there is yet another thing which makes verse upon the stage appear more unnatural ; that is , when a piece of a verse is made up by one that knew not what the other meant to say , and the former verse answered as perfectly in sound as the last is supplied in measure ; so that the smartness of a reply , which has its beauty by coming from sudden thoughts , seems lost by that which rather looks like a design of two , than the answer of one . It may be said , that rhyme is such a confinement to a quick and luxuriant fancy , that it gives a stop to its speed , till slow judgment comes in to assist it ; but this is no argument for the question in hand : for the dispute is not , which way a man may write best in , but which is most proper for the subject he writes upon ; and , if this were let pass , the argument is yet unsolved in itself : for he that wants judgment in the liberty of his fancy , may as well shew the defect of it in its confinement : and , to say truth , he that has judgment will avoid the errors , and he that wants it will commit them both . It may be objected , it is improbable that any should speak extempore as well as Beaumont and Fletcher makes them , though in blank verse : I do not only acknowledge that , but that it is also improbable any will write so well that way . But if that may be allowed improbable , I believe it may be concluded impossible that any should speak as good verses in rhyme , as the best poets have writ ; and therefore , that which seems nearest to what it intends , is ever to be preferred . Nor is great thoughts more adorned by verse , than verse unbeautified by mean ones ; so that verse seems not only unfit in the best use of it , but much more in the worse , when a servant is called , or a door bid to be shut , in rhyme . Verses ( I mean good ones ) do in their height of fancy declare the labour that brought them forth , like majesty , that grows with care ; and Nature , that made the poet capable , seems to retire , and leave its offers to be made perfect by pains and judgement . Against this I can raise no argument but my Lord of Orrery 's writings , in whose verse the greatness of the majesty seems unsullied with the cares , and his inimitable fancy descends to us in such easy expressions , that they seem as if neither had ever been added to the other , but both together flowing from a height ; like birds got so high , that use no labouring wings , but only with an easy care preserve a steadiness in motion . But this particular happiness , among those multitudes which that excellent person is owner of , does not convince my reason , but employ my wonder : yet I am glad such verse has been written for our stage , since it has so happily exceeded those whom we seemed to imitate . But while I give these arguments against verse , I may seem faulty that I have not only written ill ones , but written any : but , since it was the fashion , I was resolved , as in all indifferent things , not to appear singular , the danger of the vanity being greater than the error ; and therefore I followed it as a fashion , though very far off . ” ]</p>

    <head>HEADS</head>
    <head>OF</head>
     <l n="1">AN ANSWER TO RYMER 's REMARKS , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Thomas Rymer , distinguished as the editor of the Fœdera of England , was in his earlier years ambitious of the fame of a critic . In 1678 , he published a small duodecimo , entitled , “ The Tragedies of the last Age considered and examined by the practice of the Ancients , and the common Sense of all Ages , in a Letter to Fleetwood and Shepherd . ” The criticisms apply chiefly to the tragedies of the latter part of the reigns of Elizabeth , and James I .; out of which he has singled , as the particular subjects of reprehension , those of “ Rollo , ” “ The Maid 's Tragedy , ” and “ King and no King . ” In this criticism , there was “ much malice mingled with a little wit ; ” obvious faults and absurdities were censured as disgusting to common sense , on the one hand ; on the other , licenses unpractised by the ancients were condemned as barbarous and unclassical .</p>
   <p>A severe critic , if able but plausibly to support his remarks by learning and acumen , strikes terror through the whole world of literature . It is in vain to represent to such a person , that he only examines the debtor side of the account , and omits to credit the unfortunate author with the merit that he has justly a title to claim . Instead of a fair accounting between the public and the poet , his cause is tried as in a criminal action , where , if he is convicted of a crime , all the merit of his work will not excuse him . There must be something in the mind of man favourable to a system which tends to the levelling of talents in the public estimation , or such critics as Rymer could never have risen into notice . Yet Dryden , in the following projected answer to his Remarks , has treated him with great respect ; and Pope , according to Spence , pronounced him “ one of the best critics we ever had . ”</p>
   <p>That Dryden should have been desirous to conciliate the favour of an avowed critic , was natural enough ; but that Pope should have so spoken of Rymer , only argues , either that he was prejudiced by the opinions which his youth had sucked in from Walsh , Wycherly , and Trumbull , or that his taste for the drama was far inferior to his powers in every other range of poetry .</p>
   <p>If Dryden had arranged and extended the materials of his answer , it is possible that he would have treated Rymer with less deference than he shewed while collecting them ; for in the latter years of Dryden 's life they were upon bad terms . See Vol . xii . p. 45 , and Epistle to Congreve , Vol . xi . p. 57 .</p>
   <p>To a reader of the present day , when the cant of criticism has been in some degree abandoned , nothing can be more disgusting than the remarks of Rymer , who creeps over the most beautiful passages of the drama with eyes open only to their defects , or their departure from scholastic precept ; who denies the name of poetry to the “ Paradise Lost , ” and compares judging of “ Rollo ” by “ Othello , ” to adjusting one crooked line by another . But I would be by no means understood to say , that there is not sometimes justice , though never mercy , in his criticism .</p>
   <p>Dryden had intended to enter the lists with Rymer in defence of the ancient theatre , and with this view had wrote the following Heads of an Answer to the Remarks . They were jotted down on the blank leaves of a copy of the book presented to Dryden by Rymer . The volume falling into the hands of the publisher of Beaumont and Fletcher 's works , in 1711 , they prefixed Dryden 's observations , as furnishing an apology for their authors . They were again published by Dr Johnson , into whose hands they were put by Garrick , who had the original in his collection . The arrangement is different in the two copies ; that of Dr Johnson has been adopted , as preferred by Mr Malone .</p>

     <l n="1">ANSWER TO RYMER 's REMARKS</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ON THE</p>
   <p>TRAGEDIES OF THE LAST AGE .</p>
   <p>That we may the less wonder why pity and terror are not now the only springs on which our tragedies move ,<span corresp="#note154" type="note_anchor">[ 154 ]</span>and that Shakespeare may be more excused , Rapin confesses , that the French tragedies now all run on the tendre ; and gives the reason , because love is the passion which most predominates in our souls ; and that therefore the passions represented become insipid , unless they are conformable to the thoughts of the audience . But it is to be concluded , that this passion works not now amongst the French so strongly , as the other two did amongst the ancients . Amongst us , who have a stronger genius for writing , the operations from the writing are much stronger ; for the raising of Shakespeare 's passions is more from the excellency of the words and thoughts , than the justness of the occasion ; and if he has been able to pick single occasions , he has never founded the whole reasonably ; yet , by the genius of poetry in writing , he has succeeded .</p>
   <p>Rapin attributes more to the dictio , that is , to the words and discourse of a tragedy , than Aristotle has done , who places them in the last rank of beauties ; perhaps , only last in order , because they are the last product of the design , of the disposition or connection of its parts , of the characters , of the manners of those characters , and of the thoughts proceeding from those manners . Rapin 's words are remarkable :— It is not the admirable intrigue , the surprising events , and extraordinary incidents , that make the beauty of a tragedy ; it is the discourses , when they are natural and passionate .— So are Shakespeare 's .</p>
   <p>The parts of a poem , tragic or heroic , are ,</p>
   <p>1 . The fable itself .</p>
   <p>2 . The order or manner of its contrivance , in relation of the parts to the whole .</p>
   <p>3 . The manners , or decency of the characters , in speaking or acting what is proper for them , and proper to be shewn by the poet .</p>
   <p>4 . The thoughts , which express the manners .</p>
   <p>5 . The words , which express those thoughts .</p>
   <p>In the last of these , Homer excels Virgil ; Virgil all other ancient poets ; and Shakespeare all modern poets .</p>
   <p>For the second of these , the order : the meaning is , that a fable ought to have a beginning , middle , and an end , all just and natural ; so that that part , e. g . which is the middle , could not naturally be the beginning or end , and so of the rest : all depend on one another , like the links of a curious chain . If terror and pity are only to be raised , certainly this author follows Aristotle 's rules , and Sophocles ’ and Euripides 's example ; but joy may be raised too , and that doubly , either by seeing a wicked man punished , or a good man at last fortunate ; or perhaps indignation , to see wickedness prosperous , and goodness depressed : both these may be profitable to the end of tragedy , reformation of manners ; but the last improperly , only as it begets pity in the audience ; though Aristotle , I confess , places tragedies of this kind in the second form .</p>
   <p>He who undertakes to answer this excellent critique of Mr Rymer , in behalf of our English poets against the Greek , ought to do it in this manner : either by yielding to him the greatest part of what he contends for , which consists in this , that the μύθος i. e . the design and conduct of it , is more conducing in the Greeks to those ends of tragedy , which Aristotle and he propose , namely , to cause terror and pity ; yet the granting this does not set the Greeks above the English poets .</p>
   <p>But the answerer ought to prove two things : First , that the fable is not the greatest master-piece of a tragedy , though it be the foundation of it .</p>
   <p>Secondly , that other ends , as suitable to the nature of tragedy , may be found in the English , which were not in the Greek .</p>
   <p>Aristotle places the fable first ; not quoad dignitatem , sed quoad fundamentum : for a fable , never so movingly contrived to those ends of his , pity and terror , will operate nothing on our affections , except the characters , manners , thoughts , and words , are suitable .</p>
   <p>So that it remains for Mr Rymer to prove , that in all those , or the greatest part of them , we are inferior to Sophocles and Euripides ; and this he has offered at , in some measure ; but , I think , a little partially to the ancients .</p>
   <p>For the fable itself : it is in the English more adorned with episodes , and larger than in the Greek poets ; consequently more diverting . For if the action be but one , and that plain , without any counter-turn of design or episode , i. e . under-plot , how can it be so pleasing as the English , which have both under-plot and a turned design , which keeps the audience in expectation of the catastrophe ? whereas in the Greek poets we see through the whole design at first .</p>
   <p>For the characters , they are neither so many nor so various in Sophocles and Euripides , as in Shakespeare and Fletcher ; only they are more adapted to those ends of tragedy which Aristotle commends to us , pity and terror .</p>
   <p>The manners flow from the characters , and consequently must partake of their advantages and disadvantages .</p>
   <p>The thoughts and words , which are the fourth and fifth beauties of tragedy , are certainly more noble and more poetical in the English than in the Greek , which must be proved by comparing them somewhat more equitably than Mr Rymer has done .</p>
   <p>After all , we need not yield , that the English way is less conducing to move pity and terror , because they often shew virtue oppressed and vice punished ; where they do not both , or either , they are not to be defended .</p>
   <p>And if we should grant that the Greeks performed this better , perhaps it may admit of dispute , whether pity and terror are either the prime , or at least the only ends of tragedy .</p>
   <p>It is not enough that Aristotle has said so , for Aristotle drew his models of tragedy from Sophocles and Euripides ; and if he had seen ours , might have changed his mind . And chiefly we have to say , ( what I hinted on pity and terror , in the last paragraph save one ,) that the punishment of vice and reward of virtue are the most adequate ends of tragedy , because most conducing to good example of life . Now pity is not so easily raised for a criminal , ( and the ancient tragedy always represents its chief person such ,) as it is for an innocent man ; and the suffering of innocence and punishment of the offender is of the nature of English tragedy : contrarily , in the Greek , innocence is unhappy often , and the offender escapes . Then we are not touched with the sufferings of any sort of men so much as of lovers , and this was almost unknown to the ancients : so that they neither administered poetical justice , of which Mr Rymer boasts , so well as we ; neither knew they the best common-place of pity , which is love .</p>
   <p>He therefore unjustly blames us for not building on what the ancients left us ; for it seems , upon consideration of the premises , that we have wholly finished what they began .</p>
   <p>My judgment on this piece is this ; that it is extremely learned , but that the author of it is better read in the Greek than in the English poets ; that all writers ought to study this critique , as the best account I have ever seen of the ancients ; that the model of tragedy he has here given is excellent , and extreme correct ; but that it is not the only model of all tragedy , because it is too much circumscribed in plot , characters , &amp; c .; and lastly , that we may be taught here justly to admire and imitate the ancients , without giving them the preference , with this author , in prejudice to our own country .</p>
   <p>Want of method in this excellent treatise , makes the thoughts of the author sometimes obscure .</p>
   <p>His meaning , that pity and terror are to be moved , is , that they are to be moved as the means conducing to the ends of tragedy , which are pleasure and instruction .</p>
   <p>And these two ends may be thus distinguished . The chief end of the poet is to please ; for his immediate reputation depends on it .</p>
   <p>The great end of the poem is to instruct , which is performed by making pleasure the vehicle of that instruction ; for poesy is an art , and all arts are made to profit . Rapin .</p>
   <p>The pity which the poet is to labour for , is for the criminal , not for those or him whom he has murdered , or who have been the occasion of the tragedy . The terror is likewise in the punishment of the same criminal , who , if he be represented too great an offender , will not be pitied ; if altogether innocent , his punishment will be unjust .</p>
   <p>Another obscurity is , where he says , Sophocles perfected tragedy by introducing the third actor ;<span corresp="#note155" type="note_anchor">[ 155 ]</span>that is , he meant , three kinds of action ; one company singing , or speaking ; another playing on the music ; a third dancing .</p>
   <p>To make a true judgment in this competition betwixt the Greek poets and the English , in tragedy :</p>
   <p>Consider , first , how Aristotle has defined a tragedy . Secondly , what he assigns the end of it to be . Thirdly , what he thinks the beauties of it . Fourthly , the means to attain the end proposed .</p>
   <p>Compare the Greek and English tragic poets justly , and without partiality , according to those rules .</p>
   <p>Then , secondly , consider whether Aristotle has made a just definition of tragedy ; of its parts , of its ends , and of its beauties ; and whether he , having not seen any others but those of Sophocles , Euripides , &amp; c. had , or truly could determine what all the excellencies of tragedy are , and wherein they consist .</p>
   <p>Next shew in what ancient tragedy was deficient ; for example , in the narrowness of its plots , and fewness of persons ; and try whether that be not a fault in the Greek poets , and whether their excellency was so great , when the variety was visibly so little ; or whether what they did was not very easy to do .</p>
   <p>Then make a judgment on what the English have added to their beauties ; as , for example , not only more plot , but also new passions , as , namely , that of love , scarce touched on by the ancients , except in this one example of Phædra , cited by Mr Rymer ; and in that how short they were of Fletcher .</p>
   <p>Prove also that love , being an heroic passion , is fit for tragedy , which cannot be denied , because of the example alleged of Phædra ; and how far Shakespeare has out-done them in friendship , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>To return to the beginning of this enquiry ; consider , if pity and terror be enough for tragedy to move ; and I believe , upon a true definition of tragedy , it will be found , that its work extends farther , and that is to reform manners , by a delightful representation of human life in great persons , by way of dialogue . If this be true , then not only pity and terror are to be moved , as the only means to bring us to virtue , but generally love to virtue , and hatred to vice , by shewing the rewards of one , and punishments of the other ; at least , by rendering virtue always amiable , though it be shewn unfortunate , and vice detestable , though it be shewn triumphant .</p>
   <p>If then , the encouragement of virtue , and discouragement of vice , be the proper ends of poetry in tragedy , pity and terror , though good means , are not the only . For all the passions , in their turns , are to be set in a ferment ; as joy , anger , love , fear , are to be used as the poet 's common-places , and a general concernment for the principal actors is to be raised , by making them appear such in their characters , their words , and actions , as will interest the audience in their fortunes .</p>
   <p>And if , after all , in a larger sense , pity comprehends this concernment for the good , and terror includes detestation for the bad , then let us consider whether the English have not answered this end of tragedy , as well as the ancients , or perhaps better .</p>
   <p>And here Mr Rymer 's objections against these plays are to be impartially weighed , that we may see whether they are of weight enough to turn the balance against our countrymen .</p>
   <p>It is evident , those plays which he arraigns , have moved both those passions in a high degree upon the stage .</p>
   <p>To give the glory of this away from the poet , and to place it upon the actors , seems unjust .<span corresp="#note156" type="note_anchor">[ 156 ]</span></p>
   <p>One reason is , because whatever actors they have found , the event has been the same , that is , the same passions have been always moved ; which shews , that there is something of force and merit in the plays themselves , conducing to the design of raising these two passions : and suppose them ever to have been excellently acted , yet action only adds grace , vigour , and more life , upon the stage , but cannot give it wholly where it is not first . But secondly , I dare appeal to those who have never seen them acted , if they have not found these two passions moved within them ; and if the general voice will carry it , Mr Rymer 's prejudice will take off his single testimony .</p>
   <p>This , being matter of fact , is reasonably to be established by this appeal ; as if one man says it is night , when the rest of the world conclude it to be day , there needs no farther argument against him , that it is so .</p>
   <p>If he urge , that the general taste is depraved , his arguments to prove this can at best but evince , that our poets took not the best way to raise those passions ; but experience proves against him , that those means which they have used have been successful , and have produced them .</p>
   <p>And one reason of that success is , in my opinion , this , that Shakespeare and Fletcher have written to the genius of the age and nation in which they lived ; for though nature , as he objects , is the same in all places , and reason too the same , yet the climate , the age , the disposition of the people , to whom a poet writes , may be so different , that what pleased the Greeks would not satisfy an English audience .</p>
   <p>And if they proceeded upon a foundation of truer reason to please the Athenians , than Shakespeare and Fletcher to please the English , it only shews , that the Athenians were a more judicious people ; but the poet 's business is certainly to please the audience .</p>
   <p>Whether our English audience have been pleased hitherto with acorns , as he calls it , or with bread , is the next question ; that is , whether the means which Shakespeare and Fletcher have used in their plays to raise those passions before named , be better applied to the ends by the Greek poets than by them . And perhaps we shall not grant him this wholly : let it be yielded , that a writer is not to run down with the stream , or to please the people by their own usual methods , but rather to reform their judgments ,— it still remains to prove , that our theatre needs this total reformation .</p>
   <p>The faults which he has found in their designs , are rather wittily aggravated in many places , than reasonably urged ; and as much may be returned on the Greeks by one who were as witty as himself .</p>
   <p>2 . They destroy not , if they are granted , the foundation of the fabric , only take away from the beauty of the symmetry : for example , the faults in the character of the “ King and no King "[ 157 ] are not as he makes them , such as render him detestable , but only imperfections which accompany human nature , and are for the most part excused by the violence of his love ; so that they destroy not our pity or concernment for him . This answer may be applied to most of his objections of that kind .</p>
   <p>And Rollo<span corresp="#note158" type="note_anchor">[ 158 ]</span>committing many murders , when he is answerable but for one , is too severely arraigned by him , for it adds to our horror and detestation of the criminal ; and poetic justice is not neglected neither , for we stab him in our minds for every offence which he commits ; and the point which the poet is to gain on the audience is not so much in the death of an offender , as the raising an horror of his crimes .</p>
   <p>That the criminal should neither be wholly guilty , nor wholly innocent , but so participating of both as to move both pity and terror , is certainly a good rule , but not perpetually to be observed ; for that were to make all tragedies too much alike ; which objection he foresaw , but has not fully answered .</p>
   <p>To conclude , therefore ; if the plays of the ancients are more correctly plotted , ours are more beautifully written . And if we can raise passions as high on worse foundations , it shews our genius in tragedy is greater ; for , in all other parts of it , the English have manifestly excelled them .</p>

    <head>ON</head>
    <head>THE EMPRESS OF MOROCCO .</head>
     <l n="1">The following effusion of spleen , which is altogether unworthy of</l>
     <l n="2">Dryden , took its rise in the animosity of literary rivalship .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>About 1673 , the Earl of Rochester , who had been formerly on good terms with Dryden , had received a dedication from him , and made a suitable return of compliment ,<span corresp="#note159" type="note_anchor">[ 159 ]</span>became his bitter opponent and enemy . This was probably owing to Dryden 's intimacy with Sheffield , Earl Mulgrave , who had challenged Rochester , and publicly branded him with cowardice for his refusal to fight him .<span corresp="#note160" type="note_anchor">[ 160 ]</span>The witty and profligate courtier turned that resentment against the poet , which he durst not shew to the patron , and endeavoured to injure him on every opportunity .</p>
   <p>Elkanah Settle , whom we have had former opportunities to commemorate , was now rising into notice . He was the son of Joseph Settle , of Dunstable , in Bedfordshire , and had distinguished himself by a tragedy , called “ Cambyses , King of Persia , ” which was acted for three weeks together . Emboldened by this success , he produced a second play , entitled “ The Empress of Morocco . ” Upon this tragedy , and its author , Rochester fixed , as the implements of his plan , to humble and mortify Dryden . He made use of his influence to introduce Settle at court as a poet greatly superior to our bard ; and he was received at least upon equal terms with him . Even Sheffield contributed to Dryden 's mortification , and , perhaps in obedience to the king , graced “ The Empress of Morocco ” with a prologue of his own writing , which was spoken by Lady Betty Howard , when the piece was presented at Whitehall , by the gentlemen and ladies of the court . Rochester wrote a second prologue , which was spoken by the same lady , on a second representation of the same distinguished kind . The bookseller contributed his share of celebrity to the piece , by decorating it with four engravings , each representing a scene in the play ; an honour which had not hitherto been conferred on any single play : with these decorations it sold for two shillings , being double the common price . Lastly , the public bought up the edition with great rapidity , and very naturally employed themselves in weighing the merits of the new bard against those of our author , who had hitherto reigned paramount over the drama .</p>
   <p>All these circumstances combined to vex the spirit of Dryden . There was not only a vile bombastic production publicly weighed against his most laboured plays , but the author , presuming upon the countenance of a numerous party among the public , had openly bid him defiance , by sundry irreverend sneers at him in the prefatory epistle of his garnished and bedizened performance . This Dryden termed , “ a most arrogant , calumniating , ill-natured , and scandalous preface . "[ 161 ]</p>
   <p>It had been undoubtedly wise in Dryden to have disdained to enter the arena with such an antagonist . Settle must soon have sunk by his own weight , to the dishonour and confusion of his supporters ; but the spirit of controversy and party were to buoy him up a little longer . Our author , irritated and imprudent , entered into a league with Shadwell , ( afterwards a hostile name ,) and with John Crowne , another dramatist of the day , to humble at once the pride of Settle , by such a criticism as should make his party ashamed of their poet , and the poet of his own production . Accordingly , “ The Notes and Observations on the Empress of Morocco , ” the work of the three allies , came forth in 4to , in 1674 . None of the consequences followed which Dryden had probably expected . Settle retorted , and stupid and vulgar as he was , it was hardly possible for him to fall beneath the Billingsgate with which he had been assailed .<span corresp="#note162" type="note_anchor">[ 162 ]</span>On the contrary , he rather gained reputation by the contest , and fairly divided with Dryden the applauses of the court and of the universities . It was not until the controversy subsided , that Elkanah lost his unnatural and unmerited literary importance . In the mean time , the feud between Dryden and him was inflamed by political hatred , and at length procured Elkanah the bitter distinction , of being described in “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” under the name of Doeg . Vol . IX . pages 331 , 373 .</p>
   <p>It were to be wished , our author could be exculpated from any share in the coarse and illiberal invective which follows these introductory remarks . But it is too certain , from the evidence of Dennis , as well as Settle 's affirmation , that Dryden did stoop to revise the pamphlet , and probably to write the preface and postscript . These cannot therefore be rejected from a full edition of his works ; but I willingly follow Mr Malone 's authority in rejecting the rest of the pamphlet , excepting a small specimen .</p>
   <p>Morally considered , the piece affords an useful lesson , how much irritation can debase even the composition of genius . The best satirist , like a fencer , loses the skill of his art when he loses his temper ; and if Dryden afterwards succeeded in making a ridiculous portrait of Elkanah Settle , it was because he had lost apprehension of him as a rival , and cooled his indignation with a proportion of contempt suitable to its object .</p>

   <note xml:id="note161" place="bottom" n="161">It is addressed to Henry Earl of Norwich , and is obviously levelled against the manner of our author 's dedications . “ The impudence of scribblers in this age has so corrupted the original design of dedications , that before I dare tell you this trifle begs your lordship 's protection , I ought first to examine on what grounds I make the attack ; for now every thing that ere saw the stage , how modest soever it has been there , without daring to shew its face above three days , has yet the arrogance to thrust itself into the world in print , with a great name before it : When the fawning scribbler shall compendiously say ,— The factions of critics , the ill time of the year , and the worse acting of the players , has prejudiced his play ; but he doubts not , but his grace , or his honour 's more impartial judgment will find that pardonable , which the world has so maliciously censured ; that is as much as to say ,— Sir , you are the only person at court , whose blind side I dare venture on ; not doubting , but your good nature will excuse what all the world ( except the author ) has justly condemned . Thus a dedication , which was formerly a present to a person of quality , is now made a libel on him ; whilst the poet either supposes his patron to be so great a sot to defend that in print , which he hist off the stage ; or else makes himself a greater , in asking a favour from him , which he never expects to obtain . However , that which is abuse to the patron , is a compliment to the bookseller , who whispers the poet , and tells him , sir , your play had misfortune , and all that — but if you 'd but write a dedication , or preface .— The poet takes the hint , picks out a person of honour , tells him he has a great deal of wit , gives us an account who writ sense in the last age , supposing we cannot be ignorant who writes it in this ; disputes the nature of verse , answers a cavil or two , quibbles upon the court , huffs the critics , and the work 's done . ‘ Tis not to be imagined how far a sheet of this goes to make a bookseller rich , and a poet famous .</note>
   <p>“ But , my lord , whilst I trouble you with this kind of discourse , I beg you would not think I design to give rules to the press , as some of our tribe have done to the stage ; or that I find fault with their dedications , in compliment to my own : no , that 's a trick I do not pretend to . ” ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note162" place="bottom" n="162">He thus characterizes his three antagonists .</note>
   <p>“ Thereupon , with very little conjuration , by those three remarkable qualities of railing , boasting , and thieving , I found a Dryden in the frontispiece ; then going through the preface , I observed the drawing of a fool 's picture to be the design of the whole piece ; and reflecting on the painter , I considered that probably the pamphlet might be like his plays , not to be written without help : and according to expectation , I discovered the author of “ Epsom Wells , ” and the author of “ Pandion and Amphigenia , ” lent their assistance . How ! Three to one , thought I ! and three gentlemen of such disagreeing qualifications in one club ! The first , a man that has had wit , but is past it ; the second , that has it , if he can keep it ; and the third , that neither has , nor is ever like to have it . Then boldly on I went , and fortified with patience ( as I found it required ) for a full perusal , I wondered the less at the deformity of the piece , when such different heads went to the composure . The first of these is the only person that pretends an injury , received from a satiric line or two in the “ Epistle to Morocco ; ” and consequently I conclude him the promoter of so ill-natured a retort . The second , I suppose only putting his comical hand , to help forward with the mirth of so ridiculous a libel ; and the third , perhaps out of a vain glory of being in print , knowing himself to be such a reptile in poetry , that he 's beholding to lampoon for giving the world to know that there is such a writer in being . ” ]</p>
   <p>PREFACE</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS</p>
   <p>ON</p>
   <p>THE EMPRESS OF MOROCCO .</p>
   <p>When I first saw “ The Empress of Morocco , ” though I found it then to be a rhapsody of nonsense , I was very well contented to have let it pass , that the reputation of a new author might not be wholly damned ; but that he might be encouraged to make his audience some part of amends another time . In order to this , I strained a point of conscience to cry up some passages of the play , which I hoped would recommend it to the liking of the more favourable judges ; but the ill report it had from those that had seen it at Whitehall , had already done its business with judicious men . It was generally disliked by them ; and but for the help of scenes , and habits , and a dancing tree , even the Ludgate audience had forsaken it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 163 ]</span></p>
   <p>After this ill success , one would have thought the poet should have been sufficiently mortified ; and though he were not naturally modest , should at least have deferred the showing of his impudence till a fitter season : but instead of this , he has written before his play the most arrogant , calumniating , ill-mannered , and senseless Preface I ever saw . This upstart illiterate scribbler , who lies more open to censure than any writer of the age , comes amongst the poets , like one of the earth-born brethren ; and his first business in the world is to attack and murder all his fellows . This , I confess , raised a little indignation in me , as much as I was capable of for so contemptible a wretch , and made me think it somewhat necessary that he should be made an example , to the discouragement of all such petulant ill writers ; and that he should be dragged out of that obscurity to which his own poetry would for ever have condemned him . I knew , indeed , that to write against him was to do him too great an honour ; but I considered Ben Jonson had done it before to Dekker , our author 's predecessor , whom he chastised in his “ Poetaster , ” under the character of Crispinus ; and brought him in vomiting up his fustian and nonsense .<span type="note_anchor">[ 164 ]</span>Should our poet have been introduced in the same manner , he must have disgorged his whole play , ere he had been cleansed . Never did I see such a confused heap of false grammar , improper English , strained hyperboles , and downright bulls . His plot is incoherent , and full of absurdities , and the characters of his persons so ill chosen , that they are all either knaves or fools ; only his knaves are fools into the bargain , and so must be of necessity , while they are in his management . They all speak alike , and without distinction of character ; that is , every one rants , and swaggers , and talks nonsense abundantly . He steals notoriously from his contemporaries , but he so alters the property , by disguising his theft in ill English and bad applications , that he makes the child his own by deforming it :— male dum recitas , incipit esse tuus . A poet , when he sees his thoughts in so ill a dress , is ashamed to confess they ever belonged to him . For the Latin and Greek authors , he had certainly done them the same injury he has done the English , but that he has the excuse of Aretine for not railing against God ;— he steals not from them , because he never knew them . In short , he is an animal of a most deplored understanding , without reading and conversation : his being is in a twilight of sense , and some glimmering of thought , which he can never fashion either into wit or English . His style is boisterous and rough-hewn ; his rhyme incorrigibly lewd , and his numbers perpetually harsh and ill sounding . That little talent which he has , is fancy . He sometimes labours with a thought , but with the pudder he makes to bring it into the world , it is commonly still-born ; so that , for want of learning and elocution , he will never be able to express any thing either naturally or justly . This subjects him on all occasions to false allusions , and mistaken points of wit . As for judgment , he has not the least grain of it ; and therefore all his plays will be a mere confusion . What a beastly pattern of a king , whom he intends virtuous , has he shewn in his Muly Labas ? Yet he is the only person who is kept to his character ; for he is a perpetual fool ; and I dare undertake , that if he were played by Nokes , who acted just such another monarch in “ Macbeth ,"[ 165 ] it would give new life to the play , and do it more good than all its devils . But of all women , the Lord bless us from his Laula ! nobody can be safe from her : she is so naturally mischievous , that she kills without the least occasion , for the mere lechery of bloodshed . I suspect he took her character from the poisoning-woman , who , they say , makes almost as little ceremony of a murder as that Queen .</p>
   <p>It were endless to run over the rest ; but they are all of the same stamp . He has a heavy hand at fools , and a great felicity in writing nonsense for them . Fools they will be in spite of him . His king , his two empresses , his villain , and his sub-villain , nay his hero , have all a certain natural cast of the father ; one turn of the countenance goes through all his children . Their folly was born and bred in them ; and something of the Elkanah will be visible . Our poet , in writing fools , has very much in him of that sign-post painter , who was famous only for drawing roses : when a vintner desired him to paint a lion , he answered , he would do it to content him , but he was sure it would be like a rose . Yet since the common audience are much of his level , and both the great vulgar and the small ( as Mr Cowley calls them ) are apt to admire what they do not understand , ( omne ignotum habent pro magnifico ,) and think all which rumbles is heroic , it will be no wonder if he pass for a great author amongst town fools and city wits . With these men , they who laugh at him will be thought envious ; for they will be sure to rise up in arms for nonsense , and violently defend a cause in which they are engaged by the ties of nature and education . But it will be for the benefit of mankind hereafter to observe what kind of people they are who frequent this play , that men of common sense may know whom to shun . Yet I dare assure the reader , that one half of the faults and absurdities are not shewn ; what is here is only selected fustian , impertinence , and false grammar . There is as much behind , as would reasonably damn as many plays as there are acts ; for I am sure there are no four lines together , which are free from some error , and commonly a gross one . But here is enough to take a taste of him ; to have observed all , were to have swelled a volume , and have made you pay as dear for a fool 's picture , as you have done for his tragedy with sculptures .</p>
   <p>“ As men in incense send up vows to heaven . ”</p>
   <p>Empress of Morocco , Act II .</p>
   <p>As if incense could carry up thoughts , or a thought go up in smoke : he may as well say , he will roast or bake thoughts , as smoke them . And the allusion too is very agreeable and natural : he compares thunder , lightning , and roaring of guns , to incense ; and says thus ,— he expresses his loud joys in a concert of thundering guns , as men send up silent vows in gentle incense . If this description is not plentifully supplied with nonsense , I will refer myself to the reader . No doubt it was worth our poet 's pains to cut a river up to Morocco , for the sake of such a description of ships as this . A rare and studied piece it is . The poet has employed his art about every line , that it may be esteemed a curiosity in its kind , and himself a person endowed with a peculiar talent in writing new and exact nonsense . And for this no doubt it was , that our poet was so much courted , sent for from place to place , that you could hardly cross a street but you met him puffing and blowing , with his fardel of nonsense under his arm , driving his bulls in haste to some great person or other to shew them , as if he had lately come out of Asia or Africa with strange kinds of dromedaries , rhinoceroses , or a new Cambyses , a beast more monstrous than any of the former . Nay , both the playhouses contended for him , as if he had found out some new way of eating fire . No doubt their design was to entertain the town with a rarity . People had been long weary of good sense that looked like nonsense , and now they would treat them with nonsense which yet looked very like sense . But as he that pretended he would shew a beast which was very like a horse , and was no horse , set people much admiring what strange animal it should be , but when they came in , and found it was nothing but a plain grey mare , laughed a while at the conceit , but were ready after to stone the fellow for his impudence ; so it must needs fare with our poet , when his upper-gallery fools discover they have tricks put upon them , and all that they have so ignorantly clapped is downright nonsense . And for my part , I cannot but admire , that not only to those who know , or at least have had time enough to learn , what sense is , but also to a people who , of all nations in the world , pretend to understand best what belongs to shipping , our poet should dare to offer this fustian for sense and a description of ships ; a description so ridiculous , that Mulylabas , as errant a fool , and as ignorant of ships as he is , must needs discover , that he is abused , and that ships cannot be such things as the poet makes them . But the poet has not only been so impudent to expose all this stuff , but so arrogant to defend it with an Epistle ; like a saucy booth-keeper , that when he had put a cheat upon the people , would wrangle and fight with any that would not like it , or would offer to discover it ; for which arrogance our poet receives this correction ; and to jerk him a little the sharper , I will not transpose his verse , but by the help of his own words trans-nonsense sense , that , by my stuff , people may judge the better what his is :</p>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT . Some who are pleased with the bare sound of verse , or the rumbling of robustious nonsense , will be apt to think Mr Settle too severely handled in this pamphlet ; but I do assure the reader , that there are a vast number of errors passed by , perhaps as many , or more , than are taken notice of , both to avoid the tediousness of the work , and the greatness . It might have occasioned a volume upon such a trifle . I dare affirm , that no objections in this book are fruitless cavils : but if , through too much haste , Mr Settle may be accused of any seeming fault , which may reasonably be defended , let the passing by many gross errors without reprehension compound for it . I am not ignorant , that his admirers , who most commonly are women , will resent this very ill ; and some little friends of his , who are smatterers in poetry , will be ready for most of his gross errors to use that much mistaken plea of poetica licentia , which words fools are apt to use for the palliating the most absurd nonsense in any poem . I cannot find when poets had liberty , from any authority , to write nonsense , more than any other men . Nor is that plea of poetica licentia used as a subterfuge by any but weak professors of that art , who are commonly given over to a mist of fancy , a buzzing of invention , and a sound of something like sense , and have no use of judgment . They never think thoroughly , but the best of their thoughts are like those we have in dreams , imperfect ; which though perhaps we are often pleased with sleeping , we blush at waking . The licentious wildness and extravagance of such men 's conceits have made poetry contemned by some , though it be very unjust for any to condemn the science for the weakness of some of the professors . Men that are given over to fancy only , are little better than madmen . What people say of fire , viz . that it is a good servant , but an ill master , may not unaptly be applied to fancy ; which , when it is too active , rages , but when cooled and allayed by the judgment , produces admirable effects . But this rage of fancy is never Mr Settle 's crime ; he has too much phlegm , and too little choler , to be accused of this . He has all the pangs and throes of a fanciful poet , but is never delivered of any more perfect issue of his phlegmatic brain , than a dull Dutchwoman 's sooterkin is of her body . His style is very muddy , and yet much laboured ; for his meaning ( for sense there is not much ) is most commonly obscure , but never by reason of too much height , but lowness . His fancy never flies out of sight , but often sinks out of sight :— but now I hope the reader will excuse some digression upon the extravagant use of fancy and poetical licence . Fanciful poetry and music , used with moderation , are good ; but men who are wholly given over to either of them , are commonly as full of whimsies as diseased and splenetic men can be . Their heads are continually hot , and they have the same elevation of fancy sober , which men of sense have when they drink . So wine used moderately does not take away the judgment , but used continually , debauches men 's understandings , and turns them into sots , making their heads continually hot by accident , as the others are by nature ; so , mere poets and mere musicians are as sottish as mere drunkards are , who live in a continual mist , without seeing or judging any thing clearly . A man should be learned in several sciences , and should have a reasonable , philosophical , and in some measure a mathematical head , to be a complete and excellent poet ; and besides this , should have experience in all sorts of humours and manners of men ; should be thoroughly skilled in conversation , and should have a great knowledge of mankind in general . Mr Settle having never studied any sort of learning but poetry , and that but slenderly , as you may find by his writings , and having besides no other advantages , must make very lame work o n't ; he himself declares , he neither reads , nor cares for conversation ; so that he would persuade us he is a kind of fanatic in poetry , and has a light within him , and writes by an inspiration ; which ( like that of the heathen prophets ) a man must have no sense of his own when he receives ; and no doubt he would be thought inspired , and would be reverenced extremely in the country where Santons are worshipped . But some will , I doubt not , object , that poetry should not be reduced to the strictness of mathematics ; to which I answer , it ought to be so far mathematical as to have likeness and proportion , since they will all confess that it is a kind of painting . But they will perhaps say , that a poem is a picture to be seen at a distance , and therefore ought to be bigger than the life . I confess there must be a due distance allowed for the seeing of any thing in the world ; for an object can no more be seen at all too near , than too far off the eye : but granting that a poem is a picture to be viewed at a great distance , the distance and the bigness ought to be so suited , as though the picture be much bigger than the life , yet it must not seem so ; and what miserable mistakes some poets make for want of knowing this truly , I leave to men of sense to judge ; and by the way , let us consider that dramatic poetry , especially the English , brings the picture nearer the eye , than any other sort of poetry . But some will say after this , what licence is left for poets ? Certainly the same that good poets ever took , without being faulty , ( for surely the best were so sometimes , because they were but men ,) and that licence is fiction ; which kind of poetry is like that of landscape-painting ; and poems of this nature , though they be not vera , ought to be verisimilia . The great art of poets is either the adorning and beautifying of truth , or the inventing pleasing and probable fictions . If they invent impossible fables , like some of Æsop 's , they ought to have such morals couched under them , as may tend to the instruction of mankind , or the regulation of manners , or they can be of no use ; nor can they really delight any but such as would be pleased with Tom Thumb , without these circumstances . But there are some pedants , who will quote authority from the ancients for the faults and extravagancies of some of the moderns ; who being able to imitate nothing but the faults of the classic authors , mistake them for their excellencies . I speak with all due reverence to the ancients ; for no man esteems their perfections more than myself , though I confess I have not that blind implicit faith in them which some ignorant schoolmasters would impose upon us , to believe in all their errors , and own all their crimes : to some pedants every thing in them is of that authority , that they will create a new figure of rhetoric out of the fault of an old poet . I am apt to believe the same faults were found in them , when they wrote , which men of sense find now ; but not the excellencies which schoolmasters would persuade us : yet I must say now , Nobis non licet esse tam disertis , Musas qui colimus severiores .

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>This play was written by John Dryden , our author 's second son , and is said to have been founded on a real incident which happened at Rome . It was dedicated to Sir Robert Howard , the author 's uncle , and acted in 1696 , with the advantages of a Prologue from Congreve , and an Epilogue from our author . See Vol . X. p. 423 . I have thought convenient to acquaint the reader with somewhat concerning this comedy , though perhaps not worth his knowledge . It was sent me from Italy some years since , by my second son , to try its fortune on the stage ; and being the essay of a young unexperienced author , to confess the truth , I thought it not worthy of that honour . It is true , I was not willing to discourage him so far , as to tell him plainly my opinion , but it seems he guessed somewhat of my mind , by my long delays of his expectation ; and therefore , in my absence from the town last summer , took the boldness to dedicate his play to that person of honour whose name you will find before his Epistle . It was received by that noble gentleman with so much candour and generosity , as neither my son nor I could deserve from him . Then the play was no longer in my power ; the patron demanding it in his own right , it was delivered to him : and he was farther pleased , during my sickness , to put it into that method in which you find it ; the loose scenes digested into order , and knit into a tale . As it is , I think it may pass amongst the rest of our new plays : I know but two authors , and they are both my friends ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 167 ]</span>who have done better since the Revolution . This I dare venture to maintain , that the taste of the age is wretchedly depraved in all sorts of poetry ; nothing almost but what is abominably bad can please . The young hounds , who ought to come behind , now lead the pack ; but they miserably mistake the scent . Their poets , worthy of such an audience , know not how to distinguish their characters ; the manners are all alike inconsistent , and interfering with each other . There is scarce a man or woman of God 's making in all their farces , yet they raise an unnatural sort of laughter , the common effect of buffoonery ; and the rabble , which takes this for wit , will endure no better , because it is above their understanding . This account I take from the best judges ; for I thank God , I have had the grace hitherto to avoid the seeing or reading of their gallimaufries . But it is the latter end of a century , and I hope the next will begin better . This play , I dare assure the reader , is none of those ; it may want beauties , but the faults are neither gross , nor many . Perfection in any art is not suddenly obtained : the author of this , to his misfortune , left his country at a time when he was to have learned the language . The story he has treated , was an accident which happened at Rome , though he has transferred the scene to England . If it shall please God to restore him to me , I may perhaps inform him better of the rules of writing ; and if I am not partial , he has already shewn that a genius is not wanting to him . All that I can reasonably fear is , that the perpetual good success of ill plays may make him endeavour to please by writing worse , and by accommodating himself to the wretched capacity and liking of the present audience , from which heaven defend any of my progeny ! A poet , indeed , must live by the many ; but a good poet will make it his business to please the few . I will not proceed farther on a subject which arraigns so many of the readers . For what remains , both my son and I are extremely obliged to my dear friend , Mr Congreve , whose excellent Prologue was one of the greatest ornaments of the play . Neither is my Epilogue the worst which I have written ; though it seems , at the first sight , to expose our young clergy with too much freedom . It was on that consideration that I had once begun it otherwise , and delivered the copy of it to be spoken , in case the first part of it had given offence . This I will give you , partly in my own justification , and partly too because I think it not unworthy of your sight ; only remembering you , that the last line connects the sense to the ensuing part of it .— Farewell , reader : if you are a father , you will forgive me ; if not , you will when you are a father . Time was , when none could preach without degrees , And seven-years toil at Universities ; But when the canting saints came once in play , The spirit did their business in a day : A zealous cobler , with the gift of tongue , If he could pray six hours , might preach as long . Thus , in the primitive times of poetry , The stage to none but men of sense was free ; But thanks to your judicious taste , my masters , It lies in common , now , to poetasters . You set them up , and till you dare condemn , The satire lies on you , and not on them . When mountebanks their drugs at market cry , Is it their fault to sell , or yours to buy ? ‘ Tis true , they write with ease , and well they may ; } Fly-blows are gotten every summer 's day ; } The poet does but buz , and there 's a play . } Wit 's not his business , &amp; c.
