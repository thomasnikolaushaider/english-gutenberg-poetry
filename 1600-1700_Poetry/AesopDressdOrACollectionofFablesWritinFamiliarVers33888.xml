    <p n="8">INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p n="9">Bernard Mandeville 's first extant book in English , Some Fables after the Easie and Familiar Method of Monsieur de la Fontaine , was published in 1703 ; it reappeared with additional fables in 1704 as Aesop Dress 'd .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Neither title reveals that , except for two original fables by Mandeville , the book consists entirely of verse translations from the twelve books of La Fontaine 's Fables ( 1668-1694 ) . It is the first book-length translation from these poems into English .</p>
    <p n="10">The only previous translations from Fables into English verse appear to have been those made ten years earlier by John Dennis . Miscellanies in Verse and Prose ( 1693 ) was a curious volume of Pindaric odes , imitations of Horace , Juvenal , and Boileau , and letters that the young Dennis had written during his travels in France and Italy , including the well-known account of the “ delightful horrour ” and “ terrible Joy ” that he had experienced while crossing the Alps ; there were , finally , ten fables in octosyllabic couplets — all of them translations from La Fontaine . A word about Dennis 's fables may help to put Mandeville 's into perspective .</p>
    <p n="11">Their resemblance to the French originals is slight . Not La Fontaine , but Samuel Butler , presides over Dennis 's fables ; indeed , when Dennis discusses them in the Preface to Miscellanies , he fails to mention La Fontaine , although he devotes a large proportion of his remarks to a defense of Butler 's burlesque verse , which he acknowledges as his model .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Many people were writing Hudibrastics in the 1680 's and 1690 's : the propensity of Butler 's couplet for arousing laughter had made it a fad .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>With its jog-trot meter , insinuating swiftness , and jarring double and triple rhymes , the Hudibrastic couplet was ideally suited to the mockery performed by low burlesque . All burlesque works by an incongruity between subject and style ; the particular function of low burlesque is to debase an elevated subject by treating it in an undignified manner .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>So it was that Butler , with the assistance of a crazy style , had exploited the gap between the high pretensions and the ridiculous performances of a Puritan knight and his squire .</p>
    <p n="12">But of the hordes of scribblers that followed in the wake of Hudibras , scarcely any possessed Butler 's sense of satiric propriety . Where his success had been founded on the discrepancy between subject and style that is essential to burlesque , they employed his style with no regard for its suitability to their subjects . Ordinary narrative poems with no satiric intent were decked in Hudibrastic couplets for the sake of a superficial cleverness .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Dennis followed the fashion . His ten verse-fables are filled with outrageous Butlerisms :</p>
    <p n="13">Isgrim had all the Winter far 'd So very ill , his looks Men scar 'd . He had ( poor Dog ! ) got an evil habit , Of going to Bed with the Devil a bit , So that he had contracted a meen , Which truly represented Famine .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Whatever the intentions of the poet , it seems to be the property of the Hudibrastic couplet inevitably to denigrate its subject . While it is probable that Dennis intended his fables to be clever and modish , and nothing more , they turn out to be travesties of La Fontaine .</p>
   <p>Dennis was attempting to impose on the animal fable an alien style . From Aesop to Thurber , the chief strength of the fabulist has been his humility : by selecting animal stories as the guise for his moral lessons , he has hoped to disarm his readers into accepting the truth . This strategy would seem to rule out the style of low burlesque , for the impulse to this style — a dignified subject to be mocked out of its dignity — does not exist in the animal fable . In particular the Fables of La Fontaine , perhaps the most graceful , concise , and witty ever written , do not respond well to the ferocious manner of Dennis . Dennis translating La Fontaine resembles a bull in a china shop .</p>
   <p>While Mandeville is no gazelle either , he has better manners than Dennis . The Butlerisms are still present , but they are not everywhere and they are not so grotesque . The difference between Dennis and Mandeville may be merely the interval of ten years , during which the influence of Butler had faded ; but this seems unlikely , since Bond cites many examples of the continuing vogue of Hudibras , even well into the 1730 's .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>A more probable explanation for the difference is that , whereas Dennis was an avowed imitator of Butler who happened to be translating the Fables of La Fontaine , Mandeville seems to have been in this work chiefly a translator of La Fontaine who was , incidentally , writing at a time when the impulse to copy Butler 's superficial qualities was almost irresistible . The total number of Hudibrastic couplets in Aesop Dress 'd comes to only a handful :</p>
   <lg>

     <l n="11">If all this should not mend one 's Carcass .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Even these few unmistakable instances are less distracting than the ones in Dennis . Mandeville 's verse is much like his prose : straightforward , downright , even in tone . Here are the first ten lines of Mandeville 's “ The Fox and Wolf ":</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Fox went on the search one Night ,</l>
     <l n="2">The Moon had hung out all her light ;</l>
     <l n="3">He sees her image in a Well ;</l>
     <l n="4">But what it was he could not tell ;</l>
     <l n="5">Gets on the Bricks to look at ease :</l>
     <l n="6">At last concludes it is a Cheese :</l>
     <l n="7">One Bucket 's down , the other up ,</l>
     <l n="8">He jumps in that which was a-top ,</l>
     <l n="9">And coming to the Water , sees</l>
     <l n="10">How little Skill he had in Cheese .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">La Fontaine has this :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">... Un soir il [ le loup ] apercut</l>
     <l n="13">La lune au fond d'un puits : l'orbiculaire image</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">Dennis had inserted these lines in the pseudo-erudite Butlerian manner :</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Nearly all Mandeville 's translations are , like “ The Fox and Wolf , ” longer than their originals . The added length is partly explained by meter : Mandeville 's octosyllabic line is less capacious , as a rule , than La Fontaine 's flexible one . Thus , even though “ The Wolf and the Lamb ” moves with a speed comparable to “ Le Loup et l'Agneau , ” Mandeville takes 34 lines to La Fontaine 's 29 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>More often , Mandeville 's translations are longer than their originals because Mandeville is not able to match La Fontaine 's wit and point . “ La Lice et sa Compagne , ” an exercise in light-footed elegance , begins this way :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Une Lice etant sur son terme ,</l>
     <l n="2">Et ne sachant ou mettre un fardeau si pressant ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fait si bien qu'a la fin sa Compagne consent</l>
     <l n="4">De lui preter sa hutte , ou la Lice s'enferme .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">In translating , Mandeville expands these four lines to ten without</l>
     <l n="6">special gain :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">A Bitch , who hardly had a day</l>
     <l n="8">To reckon , knew not where to lay</l>
     <l n="9">Her Burthen down : She had no Bed ;</l>
     <l n="10">Nor any Roof to hide her Head ;</l>
     <l n="11">Desires a Bitch of the same Pack ,</l>
     <l n="12">To let her have , For Heaven 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="13">Her House against her Lying-in .</l>
     <l n="14">Th ’ other , who thought it was a Sin ,</l>
     <l n="15">To baulk a Wretch so near her Labour</l>
     <l n="16">Says , Yes , ‘ tis at your Service , Neighbor .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span></l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Perhaps it is Mandeville 's plainspokenness , his determination to say all that must be said , which causes him to state explicitly things that La Fontaine left implicit . “ La Cigale et la Fourmi , ” contrasting an irresponsible grasshopper and a provident ant , implies but subdues a contrast between art and life . Mandeville makes the contrast explicit :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And now the hungry Songster 's driv'n</l>
     <l n="2">To such a state , no Man can know it ,</l>
     <l n="3">But a Musician or a Poet ....<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Lyon and the Gnat ” is fairly close to its original in length ( 46 lines to La Fontaine 's 39 ) and in spirit ; but Mandeville does not improve his fable by supplying the adjective “ silly ” ( “ silly Spider ” ) where La Fontaine had written “ une araignee , ” or by inserting a line about the gnat 's pride , “ Puffed up and blinded with his glory , ” where La Fontaine expected his readers to discern the gnat 's pride for themselves .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>Another translation that sticks close to the French in its sense is “ The Dog and the Ass , ” in which an ass refuses food to a hungry dog and is in turn abandoned by the dog and killed by a hungry wolf . Mandeville adds the judgment that La Fontaine excluded . The wolf attacks :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Grizz'l [ the Ass ] at a distance</l>
     <l n="2">Hears him , and asks the Dog 's assistance ;</l>
     <l n="3">But he do n't budge , and serves him right ;</l>
     <l n="4">Says he , I never us 'd to fight</l>
     <l n="5">Without a cause for fighting 's sake ....<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>The italicized words , entirely added by Mandeville , apparently represent his conviction that the irony of La Fontaine 's fable would be intensified by the dog 's sardonic comment and the translator 's “ serves him right . ” Other examples might be cited of Mandeville 's explicitness .</p>
   <p>The characterizing details of some of the great fables , however , disappear in Mandeville 's English . Although “ The Plague among the Beasts ” is faithful to the original , the tragic overtones of “ Les Animaux malade de la Peste ” are not recaptured ; they are perhaps unrecapturable . The ironies of La Fontaine 's characterization are ignored : the lion 's “ L'histoire nous apprend , ” for instance , by which the unscrupulous politician poses as a deep-browed savant ; the description of the other beasts as “ petits saints , ” and of the wolf who condemns the innocent ass as “ quelque peu clerc ” — these disappear .<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>“ L'Ivrogne et sa Femme ” meets the same fate . Mandeville retains the outlines of the original but treats the details perfunctorily , as though he had given up trying to re-create the comic terror of La Fontaine 's little masterpiece . “ A drunkard ” is not an adequate equivalent for “ un suppot de Bacchus ” ; “ very drunk ” is not the same as “ plein du jus de la treille ” ; entire sentences are left out , such as “ La les vapeurs du vin nouveau / Cuverent a loisir ” ; and the ending of the poem suffers from the alteration of details and from an awkward inversion for the sake of a rhyme :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He says to his dissembling Spirit ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who are you in the Name of Evil ?</l>
     <l n="3">She answers hoarsely I 'm a Devil ,</l>
     <l n="4">That carries Victuals to the Damn 'd</l>
     <l n="5">By me they are with Brimstone cramm 'd .</l>
     <l n="6">What , says the Husband , do you think</l>
     <l n="7">Never to bring them any Drink ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">“ Quelle personne es-tu ? dit-il a ce fantome .</l>
     <l n="9">— La celleriere du royaume</l>
     <l n="10">De Satan , reprit-elle ; et je porte a manger</l>
     <l n="11">A ceux qu'enclot la tombe noire . ”</l>
     <l n="12">Le mari repart , sans songer :</l>
     <l n="13">“ Tu ne leur portes point a boire ? "[ 16 ]</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Of the many differences between La Fontaine and Mandeville , those noticed up to this point may be blamed on the latter 's incapacity . Some of the other changes may be partially justified on the grounds that through them Mandeville was deliberately trying to alter the tone of the poem , to give it an earthiness of spirit congruent with his temperament . La Fontaine 's “ Le Lion malade et le Renard ” begins with hushed dignity :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">De par le roi des animaux ,</l>
     <l n="2">Qui dans son antre etait malade ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fut fait savoir a ses vassaux</l>
     <l n="4">Que chaque espece en ambassade</l>
     <l n="5">Envoyat gens le visiter ....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Mandeville 's translation begins :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">The king of Brutes sent all about ,</l>
     <l n="8">He was afflicted with the gout ....<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span></l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The gout is a standard comic disease which Mandeville gives to his lion to make him comically undignified . La Fontaine 's lion remains dignified and restrained throughout . ( The two versions of this fable are also instances of the relative capabilities of the French and the English four-stress lines . ) In another fable , a tonal difference appears in some lines describing the meeting of a haggard wolf and a well-fed dog :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Le Loup donc l'aborde humblement ,</l>
     <l n="2">Entre en propos , et lui fait compliment</l>
     <l n="3">Sur son embonpoint , qu'il admire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">And therefore in a humble way</l>
     <l n="5">He gives the Dog the time o ’ th ’ Day ;</l>
     <l n="6">Talks mighty complaisant , and vents</l>
     <l n="7">A Waggon Load of Compliments</l>
     <l n="8">Upon his being in such a Case ,</l>
     <l n="9">His brawny Flank and jolly Face .<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span></l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The tone of polite gravity is gone ; what remains is less succinct , but more specific , and in its way effective . When Mandeville 's invention is working well , as it does in “ The Wolf and Dog , ” it provides , in its colloquial heartiness , an adequate substitute for La Fontaine 's refinement of tone and subtlety of detail . On the whole , his fables are close to their originals , especially when compared to those of Dennis , even though “ the easie and familiar method of Monsieur de La Fontaine ” is something that , despite his professions , Mandeville fails to reproduce .</p>
   <p>Only two years intervened between Mandeville 's translations from La Fontaine ( 1703 ) and The Grumbling Hive ( 1705 ) , the 433-line fable that , through the years , would grow into that great repository of social , political , and economic nonconformity , The Fable of the Bees . It is not surprising that many of the fables which Mandeville chose to translate anticipate the themes of his great work . Among these are “ The Milk Woman , ” on the self-flatery of the egoistic dream ; “ The Frogs asking for a King , ” on the instability of human desires ; “ The Wolves and the Sheep , ” on political self-deception ; “ Hands , Feet , and Belly , ” on social interdependence ; and “ The Lyon grown Old , ” on the ultimate blow to pride .<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span></p>
   <p>Since Mandeville would give so much space in The Fable of the Bees to his analysis of pride ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>it is appropriate that pride engaged his attention in this early book of fables . “ The Frog ” is notable chiefly because Mandeville lengthened La Fontaine 's moral of four lines to fourteen in order to glance at the social and economic implications of pride :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">So full of Pride is every Age !</l>
     <l n="2">A Citizen must have a Page ,</l>
     <l n="3">A Petty Prince Ambassadors ,</l>
     <l n="4">And Tradesmens Children Governours ;</l>
     <l n="5">A Fellow , that i'n ' t worth a Louse ,</l>
     <l n="6">Still keeps his Coach and Country-house ;</l>
     <l n="7">A Merchant swell 'd with haughtiness ,</l>
     <l n="8">Looks ten times bigger than he is ;</l>
     <l n="9">Buys all , and draws upon his Friend ,</l>
     <l n="10">As if his Credit had no end ;</l>
     <l n="11">At length he strains with so much Force ,</l>
     <l n="12">Till , like the Frog , he bursts in course ,</l>
     <l n="13">And , by his empty Skin you find ,</l>
     <l n="14">That he was only fill 'd with Wind .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>Two of the 39 fables in the collection are original productions : “ The Carp ” and “ The Owl and the Nightingale . ” Both poems focus upon pride . “ The Carp ” tells the story of a young and inexperienced English carp who swims into foreign waters to learn “ manners and arts . ” Warned by a herring to go home and learn first about his own country , the carp rebuffs this honest advice , takes up with fops , and is drawn into ruin before he finally returns home “ as vain and ignorant , / As e'er he was before he went . ” The subject of the moral reflections at the end is self-delusion in the particular form of sophisticated vanity .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>The other poem , “ The Owl and the Nightingale ” ( the longest poem in the collection , at 181 lines ) , also concerns pride . The Eagle , having looked unsuccessfully among the birds of his court for a singing night-watchman , sends out a general letter . The nightingale realizes with excitement that he will easily win the competition ; but he coyly refuses to go to court until sent for , makes elaborate self-depreciations in the eagle 's presence , and hold out , obviously , for more recognition and reward . While he delays , an owl has been persuaded by friends to try for the position and has a hearing . Although he sings unskillfully , he manages to stay awake . When the nightingale returns to court the next day , he is infuriated to learn that an owl is competing against him and that the eagle has ordered the two birds to perform against one another that night . The nightingale protests so loudly and treasonably that he is kicked out of court , and the owl , dull but faithful , is declared the winner . The moral follows :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Princes can never satisfy</l>
     <l n="2">That Worth that rates itself too high .</l>
     <l n="3">What pity it is ! some Men of Parts</l>
     <l n="4">Should have such haughty stubborn Hearts :</l>
     <l n="5">When once they are courted they grow vain :</l>
     <l n="6">Ambitious Souls cannot contain</l>
     <l n="7">Their Joy , which when they strive to hide ,</l>
     <l n="8">They cover it with so much Pride ,</l>
     <l n="9">So Saucy to Superiors ,</l>
     <l n="10">Impatient of Competitors ,</l>
     <l n="11">Th ’ are utterly untractable ,</l>
     <l n="12">And put off like our Nightingale .</l>
     <l n="13">Many with him might have been great ,</l>
     <l n="14">Promoted Friends , and serv 'd the State ,</l>
     <l n="15">That have beheld , with too much Joy ,</l>
     <l n="16">The wish 'd for Opportunity ;</l>
     <l n="17">Then slipt it by their own Delays ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sloth , Pride , or other willful Ways .</l>
     <l n="19">And ever after strove in vain</l>
     <l n="20">To see the Forelock once again .<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span></l>

   <p>In some respects this poem looks forward to The Fable of the Bees . Mandeville subjects the nightingale to a brief psychological analysis and looks on his failure with a blend of detached pity and satiric mordancy ; he strips away the sophisticated defenses that hide the basic emotions , recommending honesty with oneself and with others ; he identifies the personal interests of the members of society with the interests of the state . It remains to point out that neither here nor elsewhere in this collection does Mandeville assert that private vices are public benefits .</p>

     <l n="1">PREFACE to the READER .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Prefaces and Cuts are commonly made use of much to the same Purpose ; to set off , and to explain . The latter , being too expensive , are pretty well out of date , in an Age , where there are abundance of fine things to be bought besides Books . But the first by wicked Custom , are become so necessary , that a Volume would look as defective without one , as if it wanted the very Title Page . Though it is hard I should be compelled to talk to my Reader , whether I have any thing to say to him or not . Nay , what is worse , every Body thinks a Man should be more lavish here of his Skill and Learning , than anywhere else : Here they would have him shew his Airs , and therefore most Authors adorn their Prefaces , as if they were triumphal Arches ; there 's nothing empty to be seen about ‘ em , and from top to bottom they are to be crowded with Emblems and pretty Sayings , judiciously interwoven with Scraps of Latin ; though they should borrow ‘ em from the Parson of the Parish . These , I say , are the Entertainments where they love to glut us with Wit and fine Language ; though they starve us for ever after : Which makes some of ‘ em look like a rich piece of Fillegrew Work over the Door of an empty Parlour . But I am resolved my Portico shall suit with the rest of the House , and , as every thing is plain within , nothing shall be carv 'd or gilt without : Besides , I hate formality , Good Reader , and all my Business with you is to let you know , that I have writ some Fables in Verse , after the Familiar Way of a Great Man in France , Monsieur de la Fontaine . I have confin 'd my self to strict Numbers , and endeavour 'd to make ‘ em free and natural ; if they prove otherwise , I 'm sorry for it . Two of the Fables are of my own Invention ; but I am so far from loving ‘ em the better , that I think they are the worst in the Pack : And therefore in good Manners to my self I conceal their Names . Find ‘ em out , and welcome . I could wish to have furnish 'd you with something more worthy your precious time : But as you 'll find nothing very Instructive , so there 's little to puzzle your Brain . Besides , I desire every Body to read ‘ em at the same Hours I writ ‘ em , that 's when I had nothing else to do . If any like these Trifles , perhaps I may go on ; if not , you shall be troubled with no more of ‘ em : And so fare ye well Reader .</p>
   <p>The TWO DRAGONS . A Fable .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Not long ago th ’ Ambassador</l>
     <l n="2">From the great Turk to the Emperor ,</l>
     <l n="3">Extoll 'd his Master 's strength , beyond</l>
     <l n="4">The German Force ; a Courtier , fond</l>
     <l n="5">Of his own Country , boastingly</l>
     <l n="6">Said , his Imperial Majesty</l>
     <l n="7">Had many Princes under him ,</l>
     <l n="8">So powerful , that each of ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="9">Could raise an Army of his own ,</l>
     <l n="10">And more than one that wore a Crown .</l>
     <l n="11">I know , says th ’ other , very well ,</l>
     <l n="12">Your Dukes and Pow'rs Electoral ,</l>
     <l n="13">With others , that advance the glory</l>
     <l n="14">Of th ’ Empire . But I 'll tell y ’ a story :</l>
     <l n="15">I dreamt I saw a frightful Beast ,</l>
     <l n="16">That had a hundred Heads at least ;</l>
     <l n="17">At first I startled at the sight ;</l>
     <l n="18">But soon recovering from my Fright ,</l>
     <l n="19">I ventured on , and coming near it ,</l>
     <l n="20">I found I had no cause to fear it :</l>
     <l n="21">For every Head did what it would ;</l>
     <l n="22">Some work 'd with all the Force they could ;</l>
     <l n="23">But most of ‘ em lay of a heap ,</l>
     <l n="24">And look 'd as if th ’ been asleep ;</l>
     <l n="25">Others , in hopes of better Prey ,</l>
     <l n="26">Were pulling quite another way .</l>
