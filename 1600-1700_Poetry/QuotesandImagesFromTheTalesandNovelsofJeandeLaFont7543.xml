   <p>A pretty wife ? Beware the monks as you would guard your life</p>
   <p>Above all law is might</p>
   <p>Avoid attorneys , if you comfort crave</p>
   <p>Delays are dangerous , in love or war</p>
   <p>Ev'ry grave 's the same</p>
   <p>Extremes in ev'ry thing will soonest tire</p>
   <p>In childhood FEAR ‘ s the lesson first we know !</p>
   <p>In country villages each step is seen</p>
   <p>In the midst of society , he was absent from it</p>
   <p>Monks are knaves in Virtue 's mask</p>
   <p>No folly greater than to heighten pain</p>
   <p>Some ostentation ever is with grief</p>
   <p>The god of love and wisdom ne'er agree</p>
   <p>Those who weep most the soonest gain relief</p>
   <p>Tis past our pow'r to live on love or air</p>
   <p>Twere wrong with hope our fond desires to feed</p>
   <p>We scarcely good can find without alloy</p>
   <p>Who knows too much , oft shows a want of sense</p>

    <head>LIFE OF</head>
    <head>JEAN DE LA FONTAINE</head>
     <l n="1">Jean de La Fontaine was born on the 8th of July , 1621 , at</l>
     <l n="2">Chateau-Thierry , and his family held a respectable position there .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His education was neglected , but he had received that genius which makes amends for all . While still young the tedium of society led him into retirement , from which a taste for independence afterwards withdrew him .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He had reached the age of twenty-two , when a few sounds from the lyre of</l>
     <l n="2">Malherbe , heard by accident , awoke in him the muse which slept .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He soon became acquainted with the best models : Phoedrus , Virgil , Horace and Terence amongst the Latins ; Plutarch , Homer and Plato , amongst the Greeks ; Rabelais , Marot and d'Urfe , amongst the French ; Tasso , Ariosto and Boccaccio , amongst the Italians .</p>
   <p>He married , in compliance with the wishes of his family , a beautiful , witty and chaste woman , who drove him to despair .</p>
   <p>He was sought after and cherished by all distinguished men of letters . But it was two Ladies who kept him from experiencing the pangs of poverty .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine , if there remain anything of thee , and if it be permitted to thee for a moment to soar above all time ; see the names of La Sabliere and of Hervard pass with thine to the ages to come !</p>
   <p>The life of La Fontaine was , so to speak , only one of continual distraction . In the midst of society , he was absent from it . Regarded almost as an imbecile by the crowd , this clever author , this amiable man , only permitted himself to be seen at intervals and by friends .</p>
   <p>He had few books and few friends .</p>
   <p>Amongst a large number of works that he has left , everyone knows his fables and his tales , and the circumstances of his life are written in a hundred places .</p>
   <p>He died on the 16th of March , 1695 .</p>
   <p>He was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Joseph , by the side of Moliere .</p>
   <p>THE AUTHOR 'S PREFACE</p>
   <p>TO THE FIRST VOLUME OF THESE TALES</p>
   <p>I had resolved not to consent to the printing of these Tales , until after I had joined to them those of Boccaccio , which are those most to my taste ; but several persons have advised me to produce at once what I have remaining of these trifles , in order to prevent from cooling the curiosity to see them , which is still in its first ardour . I gave way to this advice without much difficulty , and I have thought well to profit by the occasion . Not only is that permitted me , but it would be vanity on my part to despise such an advantage ........... Now , that I should be permitted to write about these as so many others have done and with success I do not believe it can be doubted ; and people cannot condemn me for so doing , without also condemning Ariosto before me and the Ancients before Ariosto . It may be said that I should have done better to have suppressed certain details , or at least to have disguised them . Nothing was more easy , but it would have weakened the tale and taken away some of its charm : So much circumspection is only necessary in works which promise great discretion from the beginning , either by their subject or by the manner in which they are treated . I confess that it is necessary to keep within certain limits , and that the narrowest are the best ; also it must be allowed me that to be too scrupulous would spoil all . He who would wish to reduce Boccaccio to the same modesty as Virgil , would assuredly produce nothing worth having , and would sin against the laws of propriety by setting himself the task to observe them . For in order that one may not make a mistake in matters of verse and prose , extreme modesty and propriety are two very different things . Cicero makes the latter consist in saying what is appropriate one should say , considering the place , the time , and the persons to whom one is speaking . This principle once admitted , it is not a fault of judgment to entertain the people of to-day with Tales which are a little broad .</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FAVORITE QUOTATIONS</head>
     <l n="1">A pretty wife ? Beware the monks as you would guard your life</l>
     <l n="2">Above all law is might</l>
     <l n="3">Avoid attorneys , if you comfort crave</l>
     <l n="4">But reason ‘ s fruitless , with a soul on fire</l>
     <l n="5">By others do The same as you would like they should by you</l>
     <l n="6">Caresses lavish , and you 'll find return</l>
     <l n="7">Criticism never stops short nor ever wants for subjects</l>
     <l n="8">Delays are dangerous , in love or war</l>
     <l n="9">Ev'ry grave 's the same</l>
     <l n="10">Extremes in ev'ry thing will soonest tire</l>
     <l n="11">Favours , when conferred with sullen air , But little gratify</l>
     <l n="12">Few ponder long when they can dupe with ease</l>
     <l n="13">Fools or brutes , With whose ideas reason never suits</l>
     <l n="14">He who loves would fain be loved as well</l>
     <l n="15">He , who laughs , is always well received</l>
     <l n="16">Her doll , for thought , was just as well designed</l>
     <l n="17">Historick writ</l>
     <l n="18">How could he give what he had never got ?</l>
     <l n="19">In childhood FEAR ‘ s the lesson first we know !</l>
     <l n="20">In country villages each step is seen</l>
     <l n="21">In the midst of society , he was absent from it</l>
     <l n="22">Monks are knaves in Virtue 's mask</l>
     <l n="23">No folly greater than to heighten pain</l>
     <l n="24">No grief so great , but what may be subdued</l>
     <l n="25">No pleasure 's free from care you may rely</l>
     <l n="26">Not overburdened with a store of wit</l>
     <l n="27">Of't what we would not , we 're obliged to do</l>
     <l n="28">Opportunity you can n't discern — prithee go and learn</l>
     <l n="29">Perhaps one half our bliss to chance we owe</l>
     <l n="30">Possession had his passion quite destroyed</l>
     <l n="31">Regarded almost as an imbecile by the crowd</l>
     <l n="32">Removed from sight , but few for lovers grieve</l>
     <l n="33">Sight of meat brings appetite about</l>
     <l n="34">Some ostentation ever is with grief</l>
     <l n="35">The eyes :— Soul-speaking language , nothing can disguise</l>
     <l n="36">The god of love and wisdom ne'er agree</l>
     <l n="37">The less of such misfortunes said is best</l>
     <l n="38">The more of this I think , the less I know</l>
     <l n="39">The plaint is always greater than the woe</l>
     <l n="40">The promises of kings are airy dreams</l>
     <l n="41">The wish to please is ever found the same</l>
     <l n="42">Those who weep most the soonest gain relief</l>
     <l n="43">Though expectations oft away have flown</l>
     <l n="44">Tis all the same :— ‘ twill never make me grieve</l>
     <l n="45">Tis past our pow'r to live on love or air</l>
     <l n="46">To avoid the tempting bit , ‘ Tis better far at table not to sit</l>
     <l n="47">Too much you may profess</l>
     <l n="48">Twere wrong with hope our fond desires to feed</l>
     <l n="49">Was always wishing distant scenes to know</l>
     <l n="50">We scarcely good can find without alloy</l>
     <l n="51">When husbands some assistance seemed to lack</l>
     <l n="52">When mourning ‘ s nothing more than change of dress</l>
     <l n="53">When passion prompts , few obstacles can clog</l>
     <l n="54">While good , if spoken , scarcely is believed</l>
     <l n="55">Who knows too much , oft shows a want of sense</l>
     <l n="56">Who only make friends in order to gain voices in their favour</l>
     <l n="57">Who would wish to reduce Boccaccio to the same modesty as Virgil</l>
     <l n="58">Who , born for hanging , ever yet was drowned ?</l>
     <l n="59">Wife beautiful , witty and chaste woman , who drove him to despair</l>
     <l n="60">You little dream for whom you guard the store</l>
