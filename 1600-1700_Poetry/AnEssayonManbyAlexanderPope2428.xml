    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">Pope 's life as a writer falls into three periods , answering fairly enough to the three reigns in which he worked . Under Queen Anne he was an original poet , but made little money by his verses ; under George I. he was chiefly a translator , and made much money by satisfying the French - classical taste with versions of the “ Iliad ” and “ Odyssey . ” Under George I. he also edited Shakespeare , but with little profit to himself ; for Shakespeare was but a Philistine in the eyes of the French-classical critics . But as the eighteenth century grew slowly to its work , signs of a deepening interest in the real issues of life distracted men 's attention from the culture of the snuff-box and the fan . As Pope 's genius ripened , the best part of the world in which he worked was pressing forward , as a mariner who will no longer hug the coast but crowds all sail to cross the storms of a wide unknown sea . Pope 's poetry thus deepened with the course of time , and the third period of his life , which fell within the reign of George II ., was that in which he produced the “ Essay on Man , ” the “ Moral Essays , ” and the “ Satires . ” These deal wholly with aspects of human life and the great questions they raise , according throughout with the doctrine of the poet , and of the reasoning world about him in his latter day , that “ the proper study of mankind is Man . ”</p>
    <p n="2">Wrongs in high places , and the private infamy of many who enforced the doctrines of the Church , had produced in earnest men a vigorous antagonism . Tyranny and unreason of low-minded advocates had brought religion itself into question ; and profligacy of courtiers , each worshipping the golden calf seen in his mirror , had spread another form of scepticism . The intellectual scepticism , based upon an honest search for truth , could end only in making truth the surer by its questionings . The other form of scepticism , which might be traced in England from the low-minded frivolities of the court of Charles the Second , was widely spread among the weak , whose minds flinched from all earnest thought . They swelled the number of the army of bold questioners upon the ways of God to Man , but they were an idle rout of camp-followers , not combatants ; they simply ate , and drank , and died .</p>
    <p n="3">In 1697 , Pierre Bayle published at Rotterdam , his “ Historical and Critical Dictionary , ” in which the lives of men were associated with a comment that suggested , from the ills of life , the absence of divine care in the shaping of the world . Doubt was born of the corruption of society ; Nature and Man were said to be against faith in the rule of a God , wise , just , and merciful . In 1710 , after Bayle 's death , Leibnitz , a German philosopher then resident in Paris , wrote in French a book , with a title formed from Greek words meaning Justice of God , Theodicee , in which he met Bayle 's argument by reasoning that what we cannot understand confuses us , because we see only the parts of a great whole . Bayle , he said , is now in Heaven , and from his place by the throne of God , he sees the harmony of the great Universe , and doubts no more . We see only a little part in which are many details that have purposes beyond our ken . The argument of Leibnitz 's Theodicee was widely used ; and although Pope said that he had never read the Theodicee , his “ Essay on Man ” has a like argument . When any book has a wide influence upon opinion , its general ideas pass into the minds of many people who have never read it . Many now talk about evolution and natural selection , who have never read a line of Darwin .</p>
    <p n="4">In the reign of George the Second , questionings did spread that went to the roots of all religious faith , and many earnest minds were busying themselves with problems of the state of Man , and of the evidence of God in the life of man , and in the course of Nature . Out of this came , nearly at the same time , two works wholly different in method and in tone — so different , that at first sight it may seem absurd to speak of them together . They were Pope 's “ Essay on Man , ” and Butler 's “ Analogy of Religion , Natural and Revealed , to the Constitution and Course of Nature . ”</p>
    <p n="5">Butler 's “ Analogy ” was published in 1736 ; of the “ Essay on Man , ” the first two Epistles appeared in 1732 , the Third Epistle in 1733 , the Fourth in 1734 , and the closing Universal Hymn in 1738 . It may seem even more absurd to name Pope 's “ Essay on Man ” in the same breath with Milton 's “ Paradise Lost ; ” but to the best of his knowledge and power , in his smaller way , according to his nature and the questions of his time , Pope was , like Milton , endeavouring “ to justify the ways of God to Man . ” He even borrowed Milton 's line for his own poem , only weakening the verb , and said that he sought to “ vindicate the ways of God to Man . ” In Milton 's day the questioning all centred in the doctrine of the “ Fall of Man , ” and questions of God 's Justice were associated with debate on fate , fore-knowledge , and free will . In Pope 's day the question was not theological , but went to the root of all faith in existence of a God , by declaring that the state of Man and of the world about him met such faith with an absolute denial . Pope 's argument , good or bad , had nothing to do with questions of theology . Like Butler 's , it sought for grounds of faith in the conditions on which doubt was rested . Milton sought to set forth the story of the Fall in such way as to show that God was love . Pope dealt with the question of God in Nature , and the world of Man .</p>
    <p n="6">Pope 's argument was attacked with violence my M. de Crousaz , Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics in the University of Lausanne , and defended by Warburton , then chaplain to the Prince of Wales , in six letters published in 1739 , and a seventh in 1740 , for which Pope ( who died in 1744 ) was deeply grateful . His offence in the eyes of de Crousaz was that he had left out of account all doctrines of orthodox theology . But if he had been orthodox of the orthodox , his argument obviously could have been directed only to the form of doubt it sought to overcome . And when his closing hymn was condemned as the freethinker 's hymn , its censurers surely forgot that their arguments against it would equally apply to the Lord 's Prayer , of which it is , in some degree , a paraphrase .</p>
    <p n="7">The first design of the Essay on Man arranged it into four books , each consisting of a distinct group of Epistles . The First Book , in four Epistles , was to treat of man in the abstract , and of his relation to the Universe . That is the whole work as we have it now . The Second Book was to treat of Man Intellectual ; the Third Book , of Man Social , including ties to Church and State ; the Fourth Book , of Man Moral , was to illustrate abstract truth by sketches of character . This part of the design is represented by the Moral Essays , of which four were written , to which was added , as a fifth , the Epistle to Addison which had been written much earlier , in 1715 , and first published in 1720 . The four Moral essays are two pairs . One pair is upon the Characters of Men and on the Characters of Women , which would have formed the opening of the subject of the Fourth Book of the Essay : the other pair shows character expressed through a right or a wrong use of Riches : in fact , Money and Morals . The four Epistles were published separately . The fourth ( to the Earl of Burlington ) was first published in 1731 , its title then being “ Of Taste ; ” the third ( to Lord Bathurst ) followed in 1732 , the year of the publication of the first two Epistles on the “ Essay on Man . ” In 1733 , the year of publication of the Third Epistle of the “ Essay on Man , ” Pope published his Moral Essay of the “ Characters of Men . ” In 1734 followed the Fourth Epistle of the “ Essay on Man ; ” and in 1735 the “ Characters of Women , ” addressed to Martha Blount , the woman whom Pope loved , though he was withheld by a frail body from marriage . Thus the two works were , in fact , produced together , parts of one design .</p>
    <p n="8">Pope 's Satires , which still deal with characters of men , followed immediately , some appearing in a folio in January , 1735 . That part of the epistle to Arbuthnot forming the Prologue , which gives a character of Addison , as Atticus , had been sketched more than twelve years before , and earlier sketches of some smaller critics were introduced ; but the beginning and the end , the parts in which Pope spoke of himself and of his father and mother , and his friend Dr. Arbuthnot , were written in 1733 and 1734 . Then follows an imitation of the first Epistle of the Second Book of the Satires of Horace , concerning which Pope told a friend , “ When I had a fever one winter in town that confined me to my room for five or six days , Lord Bolingbroke , who came to see me , happened to take up a Horace that lay on the table , and , turning it over , dropped on the first satire in the Second Book , which begins , ‘ Sunt , quibus in satira . ’ He observed how well that would suit my case if I were to imitate it in English . After he was gone , I read it over , translated it in a morning or two , and sent it to press in a week or a fortnight after ” ( February , 1733 ) . “ And this was the occasion of my imitating some others of the Satires and Epistles . ” The two dialogues finally used as the Epilogue to the Satires were first published in the year 1738 , with the name of the year , “ Seventeen Hundred and Thirty-eight . ” Samuel Johnson 's “ London , ” his first bid for recognition , appeared in the same week , and excited in Pope not admiration only , but some active endeavour to be useful to its author .</p>
    <p n="9">The reader of Pope , as of every author , is advised to begin by letting him say what he has to say , in his own manner to an open mind that seeks only to receive the impressions which the writer wishes to convey . First let the mind and spirit of the writer come into free , full contact with the mind and spirit of the reader , whose attitude at the first reading should be simply receptive . Such reading is the condition precedent to all true judgment of a writer 's work . All criticism that is not so grounded spreads as fog over a poet 's page . Read , reader , for yourself , without once pausing to remember what you have been told to think .</p>

   <head>THE DESIGN .</head>
   <p>Having proposed to write some pieces of Human Life and Manners , such as ( to use my Lord Bacon 's expression ) come home to Men 's Business and Bosoms , I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering Man in the abstract , his Nature and his State ; since , to prove any moral duty , to enforce any moral precept , or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever , it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in , and what is the proper end and purpose of its being .</p>
   <p>The science of Human Nature is , like all other sciences , reduced to a few clear points : there are not many certain truths in this world . It is therefore in the anatomy of the Mind as in that of the Body ; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large , open , and perceptible parts , than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels , the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation . The disputes are all upon these last , and , I will venture to say , they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other , and have diminished the practice more than advanced the theory of Morality . If I could flatter myself that this Essay has any merit , it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite , in passing over terms utterly unintelligible , and in forming a temperate yet not inconsistent , and a short yet not imperfect system of Ethics .</p>
   <p>This I might have done in prose , but I chose verse , and even rhyme , for two reasons . The one will appear obvious ; that principles , maxims , or precepts so written , both strike the reader more strongly at first , and are more easily retained by him afterwards : the other may seem odd , but is true , I found I could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself ; and nothing is more certain , than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends on their conciseness . I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail , without becoming dry and tedious ; or more poetically , without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament , without wandering from the precision , or breaking the chain of reasoning : if any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity .</p>
   <p>What is now published is only to be considered as a general Map of Man , marking out no more than the greater parts , their extent , their limits , and their connection , and leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow . Consequently , these Epistles in their progress ( if I have health and leisure to make any progress ) will be less dry , and more susceptible of poetical ornament . I am here only opening the fountains , and clearing the passage . To deduce the rivers , to follow them in their course , and to observe their effects , may be a task more agreeable . P .</p>

    <head>ARGUMENT OF EPISTLE I .</head>
     <l n="1">Of the Nature and State of Man , with respect to the Universe .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Of Man in the abstract . I . That we can judge only with regard to our own system , being ignorant of the relations of systems and things , v. 17 , etc . II . That Man is not to be deemed imperfect , but a being suited to his place and rank in the Creation , agreeable to the general Order of Things , and conformable to Ends and Relations to him unknown , v. 35 , etc . III . That it is partly upon his ignorance of future events , and partly upon the hope of future state , that all his happiness in the present depends , v. 77 , etc . IV . The pride of aiming at more knowledge , and pretending to more Perfection , the cause of Man 's error and misery . The impiety of putting himself in the place of God , and judging of the fitness or unfitness , perfection or imperfection , justice or injustice of His dispensations , v. 109 , etc . V. The absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause of the Creation , or expecting that perfection in the moral world , which is not in the natural , v. 131 , etc . VI . The unreasonableness of his complaints against Providence , while on the one hand he demands the Perfections of the Angels , and on the other the bodily qualifications of the Brutes ; though to possess any of the sensitive faculties in a higher degree would render him miserable , v. 173 , etc . VII . That throughout the whole visible world , an universal order and gradation in the sensual and mental faculties is observed , which cause is a subordination of creature to creature , and of all creatures to Man . The gradations of sense , instinct , thought , reflection , reason ; that Reason alone countervails all the other faculties , v. 207 . VIII . How much further this order and subordination of living creatures may extend , above and below us ; were any part of which broken , not that part only , but the whole connected creation , must be destroyed , v. 233 . IX . The extravagance , madness , and pride of such a desire , v. 250 . X . The consequence of all , the absolute submission due to Providence , both as to our present and future state , v. 281 , etc ., to the end .</p>

     <l n="11">The latent tracts , the giddy heights , explore</l>
     <l n="12">Of all who blindly creep , or sightless soar ;</l>

     <l n="14">And catch the manners living as they rise ;</l>

     <l n="35">II . Presumptuous man ! the reason wouldst thou find ,</l>
     <l n="36">Why formed so weak , so little , and so blind ?</l>
     <l n="37">First , if thou canst , the harder reason guess ,</l>
     <l n="38">Why formed no weaker , blinder , and no less ;</l>
     <l n="39">Ask of thy mother earth , why oaks are made</l>
     <l n="40">Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade ?</l>

     <l n="44">That wisdom infinite must form the best ,</l>
     <l n="45">Where all must full or not coherent be ,</l>

     <l n="47">Then in the scale of reasoning life , ‘ tis plain ,</l>
     <l n="48">There must be , somewhere , such a rank as man :</l>
     <l n="49">And all the question ( wrangle e'er so long )</l>

     <l n="51">Respecting man , whatever wrong we call ,</l>

     <l n="54">A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain ;</l>
     <l n="55">In God 's one single can its end produce ;</l>
     <l n="56">Yet serves to second too some other use .</l>
     <l n="57">So man , who here seems principal alone ,</l>
     <l n="58">Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown ,</l>
     <l n="59">Touches some wheel , or verges to some goal ;</l>
     <l n="60">‘ Tis but a part we see , and not a whole .</l>
     <l n="61">When the proud steed shall know why man restrains</l>
     <l n="62">His fiery course , or drives him o'er the plains :</l>
     <l n="63">When the dull ox , why now he breaks the clod ,</l>
     <l n="64">Is now a victim , and now Egypt 's god :</l>

     <l n="68">This hour a slave , the next a deity .</l>
     <l n="69">Then say not man 's imperfect , Heaven in fault ;</l>
     <l n="70">Say rather man 's as perfect as he ought :</l>
     <l n="71">His knowledge measured to his state and place ;</l>
     <l n="72">His time a moment , and a point his space .</l>

     <l n="74">What matter , soon or late , or here or there ?</l>
     <l n="75">The blest to-day is as completely so ,</l>

     <l n="101">In lazy apathy let stoics boast</l>
     <l n="102">Their virtue fixed ; ‘ tis fixed as in a frost ;</l>
     <l n="103">Contracted all , retiring to the breast ;</l>
     <l n="104">But strength of mind is exercise , not rest :</l>
     <l n="105">The rising tempest puts in act the soul ,</l>
     <l n="106">Parts it may ravage , but preserves the whole .</l>
     <l n="107">On life 's vast ocean diversely we sail ,</l>
     <l n="108">Reason the card , but passion is the gale ;</l>
     <l n="109">Nor God alone in the still calm we find ,</l>
     <l n="110">He mounts the storm , and walks upon the wind .</l>
     <l n="111">Passions , like elements , though born to fight ,</l>
     <l n="112">Yet , mixed and softened , in his work unite :</l>
     <l n="113">These , ‘ tis enough to temper and employ ;</l>
     <l n="114">But what composes man , can man destroy ?</l>
     <l n="115">Suffice that Reason keep to Nature 's road ,</l>
     <l n="116">Subject , compound them , follow her and God .</l>
     <l n="117">Love , hope , and joy , fair pleasure 's smiling train ,</l>
     <l n="118">Hate , fear , and grief , the family of pain ,</l>
     <l n="119">These mixed with art , and to due bounds confined ,</l>
     <l n="120">Make and maintain the balance of the mind ;</l>
     <l n="121">The lights and shades , whose well-accorded strife</l>
     <l n="122">Gives all the strength and colour of our life .</l>
     <l n="123">Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes ;</l>
     <l n="124">And when in act they cease , in prospect rise :</l>
     <l n="125">Present to grasp , and future still to find ,</l>
     <l n="126">The whole employ of body and of mind .</l>
     <l n="127">All spread their charms , but charm not all alike ;</l>
     <l n="128">On different senses different objects strike ;</l>
     <l n="129">Hence different passions more or less inflame ,</l>
     <l n="130">As strong or weak , the organs of the frame ;</l>
     <l n="131">And hence once master passion in the breast ,</l>
     <l n="132">Like Aaron 's serpent , swallows up the rest .</l>
     <l n="133">As man , perhaps , the moment of his breath</l>
     <l n="134">Receives the lurking principle of death ;</l>
     <l n="135">The young disease that must subdue at length ,</l>
     <l n="136">Grows with his growth , and strengthens with his strength :</l>
     <l n="137">So , cast and mingled with his very frame ,</l>
     <l n="138">The mind 's disease , its ruling passion came ;</l>
     <l n="139">Each vital humour which should feed the whole ,</l>
     <l n="140">Soon flows to this , in body and in soul :</l>
     <l n="141">Whatever warms the heart , or fills the head ,</l>
     <l n="142">As the mind opens , and its functions spread ,</l>
     <l n="143">Imagination plies her dangerous art ,</l>
     <l n="144">And pours it all upon the peccant part .</l>
     <l n="145">Nature its mother , habit is its nurse ;</l>
     <l n="146">Wit , spirit , faculties , but make it worse ;</l>
     <l n="147">Reason itself but gives it edge and power ;</l>
     <l n="148">As Heaven 's blest beam turns vinegar more sour .</l>
     <l n="149">We , wretched subjects , though to lawful sway ,</l>
     <l n="150">In this weak queen some favourite still obey :</l>
     <l n="151">Ah ! if she lend not arms , as well as rules ,</l>
     <l n="152">What can she more than tell us we are fools ?</l>
     <l n="153">Teach us to mourn our nature , not to mend ,</l>
     <l n="154">A sharp accuser , but a helpless friend !</l>
     <l n="155">Or from a judge turn pleader , to persuade</l>
     <l n="156">The choice we make , or justify it made ;</l>
     <l n="157">Proud of an easy conquest all along ,</l>
     <l n="158">She but removes weak passions for the strong ;</l>
     <l n="159">So , when small humours gather to a gout ,</l>
     <l n="160">The doctor fancies he has driven them out .</l>
     <l n="161">Yes , Nature 's road must ever be preferred ;</l>
     <l n="162">Reason is here no guide , but still a guard :</l>
     <l n="163">‘ Tis hers to rectify , not overthrow ,</l>
     <l n="164">And treat this passion more as friend than foe :</l>
     <l n="165">A mightier power the strong direction sends ,</l>
     <l n="166">And several men impels to several ends :</l>
     <l n="167">Like varying winds , by other passions tossed ,</l>
     <l n="168">This drives them constant to a certain coast .</l>
     <l n="169">Let power or knowledge , gold or glory , please ,</l>
     <l n="170">Or ( oft more strong than all ) the love of ease ;</l>
     <l n="171">Through life ‘ tis followed , even at life 's expense ;</l>
     <l n="172">The merchant 's toil , the sage 's indolence ,</l>
     <l n="173">The monk 's humility , the hero 's pride ,</l>
     <l n="174">All , all alike , find reason on their side .</l>
     <l n="175">The eternal art , educing good from ill ,</l>
     <l n="176">Grafts on this passion our best principle :</l>
     <l n="177">‘ Tis thus the mercury of man is fixed ,</l>
     <l n="178">Strong grows the virtue with his nature mixed ;</l>
     <l n="179">The dross cements what else were too refined ,</l>
     <l n="180">And in one interest body acts with mind .</l>
     <l n="181">As fruits , ungrateful to the planter 's care ,</l>
     <l n="182">On savage stocks inserted , learn to bear ;</l>
     <l n="183">The surest virtues thus from passions shoot ,</l>
     <l n="184">Wild nature 's vigour working at the root .</l>
     <l n="185">What crops of wit and honesty appear</l>
     <l n="186">From spleen , from obstinacy , hate , or fear !</l>
     <l n="187">See anger , zeal and fortitude supply ;</l>
     <l n="188">Even avarice , prudence ; sloth , philosophy ;</l>
     <l n="189">Lust , through some certain strainers well refined ,</l>
     <l n="190">Is gentle love , and charms all womankind ;</l>
     <l n="191">Envy , to which th ’ ignoble mind 's a slave ,</l>
     <l n="192">Is emulation in the learned or brave ;</l>
     <l n="193">Nor virtue , male or female , can we name ,</l>
     <l n="194">But what will grow on pride , or grow on shame .</l>
     <l n="195">Thus Nature gives us ( let it check our pride )</l>
     <l n="196">The virtue nearest to our vice allied :</l>
     <l n="197">Reason the bias turns to good from ill</l>
     <l n="198">And Nero reigns a Titus , if he will .</l>
     <l n="199">The fiery soul abhorred in Catiline ,</l>
     <l n="200">In Decius charms , in Curtius is divine :</l>
     <l n="201">The same ambition can destroy or save ,</l>
     <l n="202">And makes a patriot as it makes a knave .</l>
     <l n="203">This light and darkness in our chaos joined ,</l>
     <l n="204">What shall divide ? The God within the mind .</l>
     <l n="205">Extremes in nature equal ends produce ,</l>
     <l n="206">In man they join to some mysterious use ;</l>
     <l n="207">Though each by turns the other 's bound invade ,</l>
     <l n="208">As , in some well-wrought picture , light and shade ,</l>
     <l n="209">And oft so mix , the difference is too nice</l>
     <l n="210">Where ends the virtue or begins the vice .</l>
     <l n="211">Fools ! who from hence into the notion fall ,</l>
     <l n="212">That vice or virtue there is none at all .</l>
     <l n="213">If white and black blend , soften , and unite</l>
     <l n="214">A thousand ways , is there no black or white ?</l>
     <l n="215">Ask your own heart , and nothing is so plain ;</l>
     <l n="216">‘ Tis to mistake them , costs the time and pain .</l>
     <l n="217">Vice is a monster of so frightful mien ,</l>
     <l n="218">As , to be hated , needs but to be seen ;</l>
     <l n="219">Yet seen too oft , familiar with her face ,</l>
     <l n="220">We first endure , then pity , then embrace .</l>
     <l n="221">But where th ’ extreme of vice , was ne'er agreed :</l>
     <l n="222">Ask where 's the north ? at York , ‘ tis on the Tweed ;</l>
     <l n="223">In Scotland , at the Orcades ; and there ,</l>
     <l n="224">At Greenland , Zembla , or the Lord knows where .</l>
     <l n="225">No creature owns it in the first degree ,</l>
     <l n="226">But thinks his neighbour farther gone than he ;</l>
     <l n="227">Even those who dwell beneath its very zone ,</l>
     <l n="228">Or never feel the rage , or never own ;</l>
     <l n="229">What happier nations shrink at with affright ,</l>
     <l n="230">The hard inhabitant contends is right .</l>
     <l n="231">Virtuous and vicious every man must be ,</l>
     <l n="232">Few in th ’ extreme , but all in the degree ,</l>
     <l n="233">The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise ;</l>
     <l n="234">And even the best , by fits , what they despise .</l>
     <l n="235">‘ Tis but by parts we follow good or ill ;</l>
     <l n="236">For , vice or virtue , self directs it still ;</l>
     <l n="237">Each individual seeks a several goal ;</l>
     <l n="238">But Heaven 's great view is one , and that the whole .</l>
     <l n="239">That counter-works each folly and caprice ;</l>
     <l n="240">That disappoints th ’ effect of every vice ;</l>
     <l n="241">That , happy frailties to all ranks applied ,</l>
     <l n="242">Shame to the virgin , to the matron pride ,</l>
     <l n="243">Fear to the statesman , rashness to the chief ,</l>
     <l n="244">To kings presumption , and to crowds belief :</l>
     <l n="245">That , virtue 's ends from vanity can raise ,</l>
     <l n="246">Which seeks no interest , no reward but praise ;</l>
     <l n="247">And build on wants , and on defects of mind ,</l>
     <l n="248">The joy , the peace , the glory of mankind .</l>
     <l n="249">Heaven forming each on other to depend ,</l>
     <l n="250">A master , or a servant , or a friend ,</l>
     <l n="251">Bids each on other for assistance call ,</l>
     <l n="252">Till one man 's weakness grows the strength of all .</l>
     <l n="253">Wants , frailties , passions , closer still ally</l>
     <l n="254">The common interest , or endear the tie .</l>
     <l n="255">To these we owe true friendship , love sincere ,</l>
     <l n="256">Each home-felt joy that life inherits here ;</l>
     <l n="257">Yet from the same we learn , in its decline ,</l>
     <l n="258">Those joys , those loves , those interests to resign ;</l>
     <l n="259">Taught half by reason , half by mere decay ,</l>
     <l n="260">To welcome death , and calmly pass away .</l>
     <l n="261">Whate'er the passion , knowledge , fame , or pelf ,</l>
     <l n="262">Not one will change his neighbour with himself .</l>
     <l n="263">The learned is happy nature to explore ,</l>
     <l n="264">The fool is happy that he knows no more ;</l>
     <l n="265">The rich is happy in the plenty given ,</l>
     <l n="266">The poor contents him with the care of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="267">See the blind beggar dance , the cripple sing ,</l>
     <l n="268">The sot a hero , lunatic a king ;</l>
     <l n="269">The starving chemist in his golden views</l>
     <l n="270">Supremely blest , the poet in his muse .</l>
     <l n="271">See some strange comfort every state attend ,</l>
     <l n="272">And pride bestowed on all , a common friend ;</l>
     <l n="273">See some fit passion every age supply ,</l>
     <l n="274">Hope travels through , nor quits us when we die .</l>
     <l n="275">Behold the child , by Nature 's kindly law ,</l>
     <l n="276">Pleased with a rattle , tickled with a straw :</l>
     <l n="277">Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight ,</l>
     <l n="278">A little louder , but as empty quite :</l>
     <l n="279">Scarves , garters , gold , amuse his riper stage ,</l>
     <l n="280">And beads and prayer-books are the toys of age :</l>
     <l n="281">Pleased with this bauble still , as that before ;</l>
     <l n="282">Till tired he sleeps , and life 's poor play is o'er .</l>
     <l n="283">Meanwhile opinion gilds with varying rays</l>
     <l n="284">Those painted clouds that beautify our days ;</l>
     <l n="285">Each want of happiness by hope supplied ,</l>
     <l n="286">And each vacuity of sense by pride :</l>
     <l n="287">These build as fast as knowledge can destroy ;</l>
     <l n="288">In folly 's cup still laughs the bubble , joy ;</l>
     <l n="289">One prospect lost , another still we gain ;</l>
     <l n="290">And not a vanity is given in vain ;</l>
     <l n="291">Even mean self-love becomes , by force divine ,</l>
     <l n="292">The scale to measure others ’ wants by thine .</l>
     <l n="293">See ! and confess , one comfort still must rise ,</l>
     <l n="294">‘ Tis this , though man 's a fool , yet God is wise .</l>

     <l n="1">Here , then , we rest : “ The Universal Cause</l>
     <l n="2">Acts to one end , but acts by various laws . ”</l>
     <l n="3">In all the madness of superfluous health ,</l>
     <l n="4">The trim of pride , the impudence of wealth ,</l>
     <l n="5">Let this great truth be present night and day ;</l>
     <l n="6">But most be present , if we preach or pray .</l>
     <l n="7">Look round our world ; behold the chain of love</l>
     <l n="8">Combining all below and all above .</l>
     <l n="9">See plastic Nature working to this end ,</l>
     <l n="10">The single atoms each to other tend ,</l>
     <l n="11">Attract , attracted to , the next in place</l>
     <l n="12">Formed and impelled its neighbour to embrace .</l>
     <l n="13">See matter next , with various life endued ,</l>
     <l n="14">Press to one centre still , the general good .</l>
     <l n="15">See dying vegetables life sustain ,</l>
     <l n="16">See life dissolving vegetate again :</l>
     <l n="17">All forms that perish other forms supply</l>
     <l n="18">( By turns we catch the vital breath , and die ) ,</l>
     <l n="19">Like bubbles on the sea of matter borne ,</l>
     <l n="20">They rise , they break , and to that sea return .</l>
     <l n="21">Nothing is foreign : parts relate to whole ;</l>
     <l n="22">One all-extending , all-preserving soul</l>
     <l n="23">Connects each being , greatest with the least ;</l>
     <l n="24">Made beast in aid of man , and man of beast ;</l>
     <l n="25">All served , all serving : nothing stands alone ;</l>
     <l n="26">The chain holds on , and where it ends , unknown .</l>
     <l n="27">Has God , thou fool ! worked solely for thy Thy good ,</l>
     <l n="28">Thy joy , thy pastime , thy attire , thy food ?</l>
     <l n="29">Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn ,</l>
     <l n="30">For him as kindly spread the flowery lawn :</l>
     <l n="31">Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings ?</l>
     <l n="32">Joy tunes his voice , joy elevates his wings .</l>
     <l n="33">Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat ?</l>
     <l n="34">Loves of his own and raptures swell the note .</l>
     <l n="35">The bounding steed you pompously bestride ,</l>
     <l n="36">Shares with his lord the pleasure and the pride .</l>
     <l n="37">Is thine alone the seed that strews the plain ?</l>
     <l n="38">The birds of heaven shall vindicate their grain .</l>
     <l n="39">Thine the full harvest of the golden year ?</l>
     <l n="40">Part pays , and justly , the deserving steer :</l>
     <l n="41">The hog , that ploughs not nor obeys thy call ,</l>
     <l n="42">Lives on the labours of this lord of all .</l>
     <l n="43">Know , Nature 's children all divide her care ;</l>
     <l n="44">The fur that warms a monarch , warmed a bear .</l>
     <l n="45">While man exclaims , “ See all things for my use ! ”</l>
     <l n="46">“ See man for mine ! ” replies a pampered goose :</l>
     <l n="47">And just as short of reason he must fall ,</l>
     <l n="48">Who thinks all made for one , not one for all .</l>
     <l n="49">Grant that the powerful still the weak control ;</l>
     <l n="50">Be man the wit and tyrant of the whole :</l>
     <l n="51">Nature that tyrant checks ; he only knows ,</l>
     <l n="52">And helps , another creature 's wants and woes .</l>
     <l n="53">Say , will the falcon , stooping from above ,</l>
     <l n="54">Smit with her varying plumage , spare the dove ?</l>
     <l n="55">Admires the jay the insect 's gilded wings ?</l>
     <l n="56">Or hears the hawk when Philomela sings ?</l>
     <l n="57">Man cares for all : to birds he gives his woods ,</l>
     <l n="58">To beasts his pastures , and to fish his floods ;</l>
     <l n="59">For some his interest prompts him to provide ,</l>
     <l n="60">For more his pleasure , yet for more his pride :</l>
     <l n="61">All feed on one vain patron , and enjoy</l>
     <l n="62">The extensive blessing of his luxury .</l>
     <l n="63">That very life his learned hunger craves ,</l>
     <l n="64">He saves from famine , from the savage saves ;</l>
     <l n="65">Nay , feasts the animal he dooms his feast ,</l>
     <l n="66">And , till he ends the being , makes it blest ;</l>
     <l n="67">Which sees no more the stroke , or feels the pain ,</l>
     <l n="68">Than favoured man by touch ethereal slain .</l>
     <l n="69">The creature had his feast of life before ;</l>
     <l n="70">Thou too must perish when thy feast is o'er !</l>
     <l n="71">To each unthinking being , Heaven , a friend ,</l>
     <l n="72">Gives not the useless knowledge of its end :</l>
     <l n="73">To man imparts it ; but with such a view</l>
     <l n="74">As , while he dreads it , makes him hope it too ;</l>
     <l n="75">The hour concealed , and so remote the fear ,</l>
     <l n="76">Death still draws nearer , never seeming near .</l>
     <l n="77">Great standing miracle ! that Heaven assigned</l>
     <l n="78">Its only thinking thing this turn of mind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="79">II . Whether with reason , or with instinct blest ,</l>
     <l n="80">Know , all enjoy that power which suits them best ;</l>
     <l n="81">To bliss alike by that direction tend ,</l>
     <l n="82">And find the means proportioned to their end .</l>
     <l n="83">Say , where full instinct is the unerring guide ,</l>
     <l n="84">What pope or council can they need beside ?</l>
     <l n="85">Reason , however able , cool at best ,</l>
     <l n="86">Cares not for service , or but serves when pressed ,</l>
     <l n="87">Stays till we call , and then not often near ;</l>
     <l n="88">But honest instinct comes a volunteer ,</l>
     <l n="89">Sure never to o'erhYpppHeNshoot , but just to hit ;</l>
     <l n="90">While still too wide or short is human wit ;</l>

     <l n="302">Beast , man , or angel , servant , lord , or king .</l>
     <l n="303">For forms of government let fools contest ;</l>

     <l n="306">His can n't be wrong whose life is in the right :</l>
     <l n="307">In faith and hope the world will disagree ,</l>
     <l n="308">But all mankind 's concern is charity :</l>
     <l n="309">All must be false that thwart this one great end ;</l>
     <l n="310">And all of God , that bless mankind or mend .</l>
     <l n="311">Man , like the generous vine , supported lives ;</l>
     <l n="312">The strength he gains is from the embrace he gives .</l>
     <l n="313">On their own axis as the planets run ,</l>

     <l n="338">The first , last purpose of the human soul ;</l>
     <l n="339">And knows , where faith , law , morals , all began ,</l>
     <l n="340">All end , in love of God , and love of man .</l>

     <l n="361">God loves from whole to parts : but human soul</l>
     <l n="362">Must rise from individual to the whole .</l>
     <l n="363">Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake ,</l>
     <l n="364">As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake !</l>
     <l n="365">The centre moved , a circle straight succeeds ,</l>
     <l n="366">Another still , and still another spreads ;</l>
     <l n="367">Friend , parent , neighbour , first it will embrace ;</l>
     <l n="368">His country next ; and next all human race ;</l>
     <l n="369">Wide and more wide , the o'erflowings of the mind</l>
     <l n="370">Take every creature in , of every kind ;</l>
     <l n="371">Earth smiles around , with boundless bounty blest ,</l>

    <head>EPISTLE I . TO SIR RICHARD TEMPLE , LORD COBHAM .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
     <l n="1">Of the Knowledge and Characters of Men .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I . That it is not sufficient for this knowledge to consider Man in the Abstract : Books will not serve the purpose , nor yet our own Experience singly , v. 1 . General maxims , unless they be formed upon both , will be but notional , v. 10 . Some Peculiarity in every man , characteristic to himself , yet varying from himself , v. 15 . Difficulties arising from our own Passions , Fancies , Faculties , etc ., v. 31 . The shortness of Life , to observe in , and the uncertainty of the Principles of action in men , to observe by , v. 37 , etc . Our own Principle of action often hid from ourselves , v. 41 . Some few Characters plain , but in general confounded , dissembled , or inconsistent , v. 51 . The same man utterly different in different places and seasons , v. 71 . Unimaginable weaknesses in the greatest , v. 70 , etc . Nothing constant and certain but God and Nature , v. 95 . No judging of the Motives from the actions ; the same actions proceeding from contrary Motives , and the same Motives influencing contrary actions v. 100 . II . Yet to form Characters , we can only take the strongest actions of a man 's life , and try to make them agree : The utter uncertainty of this , from Nature itself , and from Policy , v. 120 . Characters given according to the rank of men of the world , v. 135 . And some reason for it , v. 140 . Education alters the Nature , or at least Character of many , v. 149 . Actions , Passions , Opinions , Manners , Humours , or Principles all subject to change . No judging by Nature , from v. 158 to 178 . III . It only remains to find ( if we can ) his Ruling Passion : That will certainly influence all the rest , and can reconcile the seeming or real inconsistency of all his actions , v. 175 . Instanced in the extraordinary character of Clodio , v. 179 . A caution against mistaking second qualities for first , which will destroy all possibility of the knowledge of mankind , v. 210 . Examples of the strength of the Ruling Passion , and its continuation to the last breath , v. 222 , etc .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Yes , you despise the man to books confined ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who from his study rails at human kind ;</l>
     <l n="3">Though what he learns he speaks , and may advance</l>
     <l n="4">Some general maxims , or be right by chance .</l>
     <l n="5">The coxcomb bird , so talkative and grave ,</l>
     <l n="6">That from his cage cries c ** d , w ** e , and knave ,</l>
     <l n="7">Though many a passenger he rightly call ,</l>
     <l n="8">You hold him no philosopher at all .</l>
     <l n="9">And yet the fate of all extremes is such ,</l>
     <l n="10">Men may be read as well as books , too much .</l>
     <l n="11">To observations which ourselves we make ,</l>
     <l n="12">We grow more partial for the observer 's sake ;</l>
     <l n="13">To written wisdom , as another 's , less :</l>
     <l n="14">Maxims are drawn from notions , those from guess .</l>
     <l n="15">There 's some peculiar in each leaf and grain ,</l>
     <l n="16">Some unmarked fibre , or some varying vein :</l>
     <l n="17">Shall only man be taken in the gross ?</l>
     <l n="18">Grant but as many sorts of mind as moss .</l>
     <l n="19">That each from other differs , first confess ;</l>
     <l n="20">Next , that he varies from himself no less :</l>
     <l n="21">Add Nature 's , custom 's reason 's passion 's strife ,</l>
     <l n="22">And all opinion 's colours cast on life .</l>
     <l n="23">Our depths who fathoms , or our shallows finds ,</l>
     <l n="24">Quick whirls , and shifting eddies , of our minds ?</l>
     <l n="25">On human actions reason though you can ,</l>
     <l n="26">It may be reason , but it is not man :</l>
     <l n="27">His principle of action once explore ,</l>
     <l n="28">That instant ‘ tis his principle no more .</l>
     <l n="29">Like following life through creatures you dissect ,</l>
     <l n="30">You lose it in the moment you detect .</l>
     <l n="31">Yet more ; the difference is as great between</l>
     <l n="32">The optics seeing , as the object seen .</l>
     <l n="33">All manners take a tincture from our own ;</l>
     <l n="34">Or come discoloured through our passions shown .</l>
     <l n="35">Or fancy 's beam enlarges , multiplies ,</l>
     <l n="36">Contracts , inverts , and gives ten thousand dyes .</l>
     <l n="37">Nor will life 's stream for observation stay ,</l>
     <l n="38">It hurries all too fast to mark their way :</l>
     <l n="39">In vain sedate reflections we would make ,</l>
     <l n="40">When half our knowledge we must snatch , not take .</l>
     <l n="41">Oft , in the passion 's wild rotation tost ,</l>
     <l n="42">Our spring of action to ourselves is lost :</l>
     <l n="43">Tired , not determined , to the last we yield ,</l>
     <l n="44">And what comes then is master of the field .</l>
     <l n="45">As the last image of that troubled heap ,</l>
     <l n="46">When sense subsides , and fancy sports in sleep</l>
     <l n="47">( Though past the recollection of the thought ) ,</l>
     <l n="48">Becomes the stuff of which our dream is wrought :</l>
     <l n="49">Something as dim to our internal view ,</l>
     <l n="50">Is thus , perhaps , the cause of most we do .</l>
     <l n="51">True , some are open , and to all men known ;</l>
     <l n="52">Others so very close , they 're hid from none</l>
     <l n="53">( So darkness strikes the sense no less than light ) ,</l>
     <l n="54">Thus gracious Chandos is beloved at sight ;</l>
     <l n="55">And every child hates Shylock , though his soul</l>
     <l n="56">Still sits at squat , and peeps not from its hole .</l>
     <l n="57">At half mankind when generous Manly raves ,</l>
     <l n="58">All know ‘ tis virtue , for he thinks them knaves :</l>
     <l n="59">When universal homage Umbra pays ,</l>
     <l n="60">All see ‘ tis vice , and itch of vulgar praise .</l>
     <l n="61">When flattery glares , all hate it in a queen ,</l>
     <l n="62">While one there is who charms us with his spleen .</l>
     <l n="63">But these plain characters we rarely find ;</l>
     <l n="64">Though strong the bent , yet quick the turns of mind :</l>
     <l n="65">Or puzzling contraries confound the whole ;</l>
     <l n="66">Or affectations quite reverse the soul .</l>
     <l n="67">The dull , flat falsehood serves for policy ;</l>
     <l n="68">And in the cunning , truth itself 's a lie :</l>
     <l n="69">Unthought-of frailties cheat us in the wise ;</l>
     <l n="70">The fool lies hid in inconsistencies .</l>
     <l n="71">See the same man , in vigour , in the gout ;</l>
     <l n="72">Alone , in company ; in place , or out ;</l>
     <l n="73">Early at business , and at hazard late ;</l>
     <l n="74">Mad at a fox-chase , wise at a debate ;</l>
     <l n="75">Drunk at a borough , civil at a ball ;</l>
     <l n="76">Friendly at Hackney , faithless at Whitehall .</l>
     <l n="77">Catius is ever moral , ever grave ,</l>
     <l n="78">Thinks who endures a knave is next a knave ,</l>
     <l n="79">Save just at dinner — then prefers , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="80">A rogue with venison to a saint without .</l>
     <l n="81">Who would not praise Patritio 's high desert ,</l>
     <l n="82">His hand unstained , his uncorrupted heart ,</l>
     <l n="83">His comprehensive head ! all interests weighed ,</l>
     <l n="84">All Europe saved , yet Britain not betrayed .</l>
     <l n="85">He thanks you not , his pride is in piquet ,</l>
     <l n="86">Newmarket-fame , and judgment at a bet .</l>
     <l n="87">What made ( say Montagne , or more sage Charron )</l>
     <l n="88">Otho a warrior , Cromwell a buffoon ?</l>
     <l n="89">A perjured prince a leaden saint revere ,</l>
     <l n="90">A godless regent tremble at a star ?</l>
     <l n="91">The throne a bigot keep , a genius quit ,</l>
     <l n="92">Faithless through piety , and duped through wit ?</l>
     <l n="93">Europe a woman , child , or dotard rule ,</l>
     <l n="94">And just her wisest monarch made a fool ?</l>
     <l n="95">Know , God and Nature only are the same :</l>
     <l n="96">In man , the judgment shoots at flying game ,</l>
     <l n="97">A bird of passage ! gone as soon as found ,</l>
     <l n="98">Now in the moon , perhaps , now under ground .</l>
     <l n="99">In vain the sage , with retrospective eye ,</l>
     <l n="100">Would from the apparent what conclude the why ,</l>
     <l n="101">Infer the motive from the deed , and show ,</l>
     <l n="102">That what we chanced was what we meant to do .</l>
     <l n="103">Behold ! if fortune or a mistress frowns ,</l>
     <l n="104">Some plunge in business , others shave their crowns :</l>
     <l n="105">To ease the soul of one oppressive weight ,</l>
     <l n="106">This quits an empire , that embroils a state :</l>
     <l n="107">The same adust complexion has impelled</l>
     <l n="108">Charles to the convent , Philip to the field .</l>
     <l n="109">Not always actions show the man : we find</l>
     <l n="110">Who does a kindness , is not therefore kind ;</l>
     <l n="111">Perhaps prosperity becalmed his breast ,</l>
     <l n="112">Perhaps the wind just shifted from the east :</l>
     <l n="113">Not therefore humble he who seeks retreat ,</l>
     <l n="114">Pride guides his steps , and bids him shun the great :</l>
     <l n="115">Who combats bravely is not therefore brave ,</l>
     <l n="116">He dreads a death-bed like the meanest slave :</l>
     <l n="117">Who reasons wisely is not therefore wise ,</l>
     <l n="118">His pride in reasoning , not in acting lies .</l>
     <l n="119">But grant that actions best discover man ;</l>
     <l n="120">Take the most strong , and sort them as you can .</l>
     <l n="121">The few that glare each character must mark ;</l>
     <l n="122">You balance not the many in the dark .</l>
     <l n="123">What will you do with such as disagree ?</l>
     <l n="124">Suppress them , or miscall them policy ?</l>
     <l n="125">Must then at once ( the character to save )</l>
     <l n="126">The plain rough hero turn a crafty knave ?</l>
     <l n="127">Alas ! in truth the man but changed his mind ,</l>
     <l n="128">Perhaps was sick , in love , or had not dined .</l>
     <l n="129">Ask why from Britain Caesar would retreat ?</l>
     <l n="130">Caesar himself might whisper he was beat .</l>
     <l n="131">Why risk the world 's great empire for a punk ?</l>
     <l n="132">Caesar perhaps might answer he was drunk .</l>
     <l n="133">But , sage historians ! ‘ tis your task to prove</l>
     <l n="134">One action conduct ; one , heroic love .</l>
     <l n="135">‘ Tis from high life high characters are drawn ;</l>
     <l n="136">A saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn ;</l>
     <l n="137">A judge is just , a chancellor juster still ;</l>
     <l n="138">A gownman , learn 'd ; a bishop , what you will ;</l>
     <l n="139">Wise , if a minister ; but , if a king ,</l>
     <l n="140">More wise , more learned , more just , more everything .</l>
     <l n="141">Court-virtues bear , like gems , the highest rate ,</l>
     <l n="142">Born where Heaven 's influence scarce can penetrate :</l>
     <l n="143">In life 's low vale , the soil the virtues like ,</l>
     <l n="144">They please as beauties , here as wonders strike .</l>
     <l n="145">Though the same sun with all-diffusive rays</l>
     <l n="146">Blush in the rose , and in the diamond blaze ,</l>

     <l n="263">Shall feel your ruling passion strong in death :</l>
     <l n="264">Such in those moments as in all the past ,</l>
     <l n="265">“ Oh , save my country , Heaven ! ” shall be your last .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Nothing so true as what you once let fall ,</l>
     <l n="3">“ Most women have no characters at all . ”</l>
     <l n="4">Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear ,</l>
     <l n="5">And best distinguished by black , brown , or fair .</l>
     <l n="6">How many pictures of one nymph we view ,</l>
     <l n="7">All how unlike each other , all how true !</l>
     <l n="8">Arcadia 's countess , here , in ermined pride ,</l>
     <l n="9">Is , there , Pastora by a fountain side .</l>
     <l n="10">Here Fannia , leering on her own good man ,</l>
     <l n="11">And there , a naked Leda with a swan .</l>
     <l n="12">Let then the fair one beautifully cry ,</l>
     <l n="13">In Magdalen 's loose hair , and lifted eye ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or dressed in smiles of sweet Cecilia shine ,</l>
     <l n="15">With simpering angels , palms , and harps divine ;</l>
     <l n="16">Whether the charmer sinner it , or saint it ,</l>
     <l n="17">If folly grow romantic , I must paint it .</l>

     <l n="18">Come then , the colours and the ground prepare !</l>
     <l n="19">Dip in the rainbow , trick her off in air ;</l>

     <l n="22">Rufa , whose eye , quick-glancing o'er the park</l>

     <l n="26">Or Sappho at her toilet 's greasy task ,</l>
     <l n="27">With Sappho fragrant at an evening masque :</l>
     <l n="28">So morning insects that in muck begun ,</l>

     <l n="74">What has not fired her bosom or her brain ?</l>
     <l n="75">Caesar and Tall-boy , Charles and Charlemagne .</l>
     <l n="76">As Helluo , late dictator of the feast ,</l>
     <l n="77">The nose of Hautgout , and the tip of taste ,</l>

     <l n="82">The address , the delicacy — stoops at once ,</l>

     <l n="106">Or who in sweet vicissitude appears</l>
     <l n="107">Of mirth and opium , ratafie and tears ,</l>

     <l n="109">To kill those foes to fair ones , time and thought .</l>
     <l n="110">Woman and fool are two hard things to hit ;</l>

     <l n="118">No thought advances , but her eddy brain</l>
     <l n="119">Whisks it about , and down it goes again .</l>
     <l n="120">Full sixty years the world has been her trade ,</l>

     <l n="128">Her every turn with violence pursued ,</l>
     <l n="129">Nor more a storm her hate than gratitude :</l>
     <l n="130">To that each passion turns , or soon or late ;</l>
     <l n="131">Love , if it makes her yield , must make her hate :</l>
     <l n="132">Superiors ? death ! and equals ? what a curse !</l>
     <l n="133">But an inferior not dependent ? worse .</l>
     <l n="134">Offend her , and she knows not to forgive ;</l>
     <l n="135">Oblige her , and she 'll hate you while you live :</l>
     <l n="136">But die , and she 'll adore you — then the bust</l>
     <l n="137">And temple rise — then fall again to dust .</l>
     <l n="138">Last night , her lord was all that 's good and great ;</l>
     <l n="139">A knave this morning , and his will a cheat .</l>

     <l n="148">Pictures like these , dear madam , to design ,</l>

     <l n="157">Say , what can Chloe want ? ” — She wants a heart .</l>
     <l n="158">She speaks , behaves , and acts just as she ought ;</l>
     <l n="159">But never , never , reached one generous thought .</l>
     <l n="160">Virtue she finds too painful an endeavour ,</l>
     <l n="161">Content to dwell in decencies for ever .</l>
     <l n="162">So very reasonable , so unmoved ,</l>
     <l n="163">As never yet to love , or to be loved .</l>
     <l n="164">She , while her lover pants upon her breast ,</l>

     <l n="172">Of all her dears she never slandered one ,</l>
     <l n="173">But cares not if a thousand are undone .</l>
     <l n="174">Would Chloe know if you 're alive or dead ?</l>
     <l n="175">She bids her footman put it in her head .</l>
     <l n="176">Chloe is prudent — would you too be wise ?</l>
     <l n="177">Then never break your heart when Chloe dies .</l>
     <l n="178">One certain portrait may ( I grant ) be seen ,</l>
     <l n="179">Which Heaven has varnished out , and made a Queen .</l>
     <l n="180">The same for ever ! and described by all</l>
     <l n="181">With truth and goodness , as with crown and ball .</l>
     <l n="182">Poets heap virtues , painters gems at will ,</l>
     <l n="183">And show their zeal , and hide their want of skill .</l>
     <l n="184">‘ Tis well — but , artists ! who can paint or write ,</l>
     <l n="185">To draw the naked is your true delight .</l>
     <l n="186">That robe of quality so struts and swells ,</l>
     <l n="187">None see what parts of nature it conceals :</l>
     <l n="188">The exactest traits of body or of mind ,</l>
     <l n="189">We owe to models of an humble kind .</l>
     <l n="190">If Queensbury to strip there 's no compelling ,</l>
     <l n="191">‘ Tis from a handmaid we must take a Helen ,</l>
     <l n="192">From peer or bishop ‘ tis no easy thing</l>
     <l n="193">To draw the man who loves his God or king :</l>
     <l n="194">Alas ! I copy ( or my draught would fail )</l>
     <l n="195">From honest Mah'met , or plain Parson Hale .</l>
     <l n="196">But grant in public men sometimes are shown ,</l>
     <l n="197">A woman 's seen in private life alone :</l>
     <l n="198">Our bolder talents in full light displayed ;</l>
     <l n="199">Your virtues open fairest in the shade .</l>
     <l n="200">Bred to disguise , in public ‘ tis you hide ;</l>
     <l n="201">There , none distinguish ‘ twixt your shame or pride ,</l>
     <l n="202">Weakness or delicacy ; all so nice ,</l>
     <l n="203">That each may seem a virtue or a vice .</l>
     <l n="204">In men , we various ruling passions find ;</l>
     <l n="205">In women , two almost divide the kind :</l>
     <l n="206">Those , only fixed they first or last obey —</l>
     <l n="207">The love of pleasure , and the love of sway .</l>
     <l n="208">That , Nature gives ; and where the lesson taught</l>
     <l n="209">Is but to please , can pleasure seem a fault ?</l>
     <l n="210">Experience , this ; by man 's oppression curst ,</l>
     <l n="211">They seek the second not to lose the first .</l>
     <l n="212">Men , some to business , some to pleasure take ;</l>
     <l n="213">But every woman is at heart a rake :</l>
     <l n="214">Men , some to quiet , some to public strife ;</l>
     <l n="215">But every lady would be queen for life .</l>
     <l n="216">Yet mark the fate of a whole sex of queens !</l>
     <l n="217">Power all their end , but beauty all the means :</l>
     <l n="218">In youth they conquer , with so wild a rage ,</l>
     <l n="219">As leaves them scarce a subject in their age :</l>
     <l n="220">For foreign glory , foreign joy , they roam ;</l>
     <l n="221">No thought of peace or happiness at home .</l>
     <l n="222">But wisdom 's triumph is well-timed retreat ,</l>
     <l n="223">As hard a science to the fair as great !</l>
     <l n="224">Beauties , like tyrants , old and friendless grown ,</l>
     <l n="225">Yet hate repose , and dread to be alone ,</l>
     <l n="226">Worn out in public , weary every eye ,</l>
     <l n="227">Nor leave one sigh behind them when they die .</l>
     <l n="228">Pleasures the sex , as children birds , pursue ,</l>
     <l n="229">Still out of reach , yet never out of view ;</l>
     <l n="230">Sure , if they catch , to spoil the toy at most ,</l>
     <l n="231">To covet flying , and regret when lost :</l>
     <l n="232">At last , to follies youth could scarce defend ,</l>
     <l n="233">It grows their age 's prudence to pretend ;</l>
     <l n="234">Ashamed to own they gave delight before ,</l>
     <l n="235">Reduced to feign it , when they give no more :</l>
     <l n="236">As hags hold Sabbaths , less for joy than spite ,</l>
     <l n="237">So these their merry , miserable night ;</l>
     <l n="238">Still round and round the ghosts of beauty glide ,</l>
     <l n="239">And haunt the places where their honour died .</l>
     <l n="240">See how the world its veterans rewards !</l>
     <l n="241">A youth of frolics , an old age of cards ;</l>
     <l n="242">Fair to no purpose , artful to no end ;</l>
     <l n="243">Young without lovers , old without a friend ;</l>
     <l n="244">A fop their passion , but their prize a sot ;</l>
     <l n="245">Alive , ridiculous ; and dead , forgot !</l>
     <l n="246">Ah ! friend ! to dazzle let the vain design ;</l>
     <l n="247">To raise the thought and touch the heart be thine !</l>
     <l n="248">That charm shall grow , while what fatigues the ring ,</l>
     <l n="249">Flaunts and goes down , an unregarded thing :</l>
     <l n="250">So when the sun 's broad beam has tired the sight ,</l>
     <l n="251">All mild ascends the moon 's more sober light ;</l>
     <l n="252">Serene in virgin modesty she shines ,</l>
     <l n="253">And unobserved the glaring orb declines .</l>
     <l n="254">Oh ! blest with temper whose unclouded ray</l>
     <l n="255">Can make to-morrow cheerful as to-day ,</l>
     <l n="256">She , who can love a sister 's charms , or hear</l>
     <l n="257">Sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear ;</l>
     <l n="258">She , who ne'er answers till a husband cools ,</l>
     <l n="259">Or , if she rules him , never shows she rules ;</l>
     <l n="260">Charms by accepting , by submitting sways ,</l>
     <l n="261">Yet has her humour most , when she obeys ;</l>
     <l n="262">Let fops or fortune fly which way they will ;</l>
     <l n="263">Disdains all loss of tickets , or Codille :</l>
     <l n="264">Spleen , vapours , or small-pox , above them all ,</l>
     <l n="265">And mistress of herself , though China fall .</l>
     <l n="266">And yet , believe me , good as well as ill ,</l>
     <l n="267">Woman 's at best a contradiction still .</l>
     <l n="268">Heaven , when it strives to polish all it can</l>
     <l n="269">Its last best work , but forms a softer man ;</l>
     <l n="270">Picks from each sex , to make the fav'rite blest ,</l>
     <l n="271">Your love of pleasure , or desire of rest :</l>
     <l n="272">Blends , in exception to all general rules ,</l>
     <l n="273">Your taste of follies , with our scorn of fools :</l>
     <l n="274">Reserve with frankness , art with truth allied ,</l>
     <l n="275">Courage with softness , modesty with pride ;</l>
     <l n="276">Fixed principles , with fancy ever new ;</l>
     <l n="277">Shakes all together , and produces — You .</l>
     <l n="278">Be this a woman 's fame : with this unblest ,</l>
     <l n="279">Toasts live a scorn , and queens may die a jest .</l>
     <l n="280">This Phoebus promised ( I forget the year )</l>
     <l n="281">When those blue eyes first opened on the sphere ;</l>
     <l n="282">Ascendant Phoebus watched that hour with care ,</l>
     <l n="283">Averted half your parents ’ simple prayer ,</l>
     <l n="284">And gave you beauty , but denied the pelf</l>
     <l n="285">That buys your sex a tyrant o'er itself .</l>
     <l n="286">The gen'rous god , who wit and gold refines ,</l>
     <l n="287">And ripens spirits as he ripens mines ,</l>
     <l n="288">Kept dross for duchesses — the world shall know it —</l>

    <head>EPISTLE III . TO ALLEN LORD BATHURST .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>That it is known to few , most falling into one of the extremes , Avarice or Profusion , v. 1 , etc . The point discussed , whether the invention of money has been more commodious or pernicious to Mankind , v. 21 to 77 . That Riches , either to the Avaricious or the Prodigal , cannot afford Happiness , scarcely Necessaries , v. 89-160 . That Avarice is an absolute Frenzy , without an end or purpose , v. 113 , etc ., 152 . Conjectures about the motives of Avaricious men , v. 121 to 153 . That the conduct of men , with respect to Riches , can only be accounted for by the Order of Providence , which works the general good out of extremes , and brings all to its great End by perpetual Revolutions , v. 161 to 178 . How a Miser acts upon Principles which appear to him reasonable , v. 179 . How a Prodigal does the same , v. 199 . The due Medium and true use of Riches , v. 219 . The Man of Ross , v. 250 .

   <lg>
     <l n="1">P. Who shall decide , when doctors disagree ,</l>
     <l n="2">And soundest casuists doubt , like you and me ?</l>
     <l n="3">You hold the word , from Jove to Momus given ,</l>
     <l n="4">That man was made the standing jest of Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="5">And gold but sent to keep the fools in play ,</l>
     <l n="6">For some to heap , and some to throw away .</l>
     <l n="7">But I , who think more highly of our kind ,</l>
     <l n="8">( And surely , Heaven and I are of a mind )</l>
     <l n="9">Opine , that Nature , as in duty bound ,</l>
     <l n="10">Deep hid the shining mischief under ground :</l>
     <l n="11">But when by man 's audacious labour won ,</l>
     <l n="12">Flamed forth this rival to its sire , the sun ,</l>
     <l n="13">Then careful Heaven supplied two sorts of men ,</l>
     <l n="14">To squander these , and those to hide again .</l>
     <l n="15">Like doctors thus , when much dispute has past ,</l>
     <l n="16">We find our tenets just the same at last .</l>
     <l n="17">Both fairly owning Riches , in effect ,</l>
     <l n="18">No grace of Heaven or token of th ’ elect ;</l>
     <l n="19">Given to the fool , the mad , the vain , the evil ,</l>
     <l n="20">To Ward , to Waters , Chartres , and the devil .</l>
     <l n="21">B . What Nature wants , commodious gold bestows ,</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Tis thus we eat the bread another sows .</l>
     <l n="23">P. But how unequal it bestows , observe ;</l>
     <l n="24">‘ Tis thus we riot , while , who sow it , starve :</l>
     <l n="25">What Nature wants ( a phrase I much distrust )</l>
     <l n="26">Extends to luxury , extends to lust :</l>
     <l n="27">Useful , I grant , it serves what life requires ,</l>
     <l n="28">But , dreadful too , the dark assassin hires .</l>
     <l n="29">B . Trade it may help , society extend .</l>
     <l n="30">P. But lures the pirate , and corrupts the friend .</l>
     <l n="31">B . It raises armies in a nation 's aid .</l>
     <l n="32">P. But bribes a senate , and the land 's betrayed .</l>
     <l n="33">In vain may heroes fight , and patriots rave ;</l>
     <l n="34">If secret gold sap on from knave to knave .</l>
     <l n="35">Once , we confess , beneath the patriot 's cloak ,</l>
     <l n="36">From the cracked bag the dropping guinea spoke ,</l>
     <l n="37">And jingling down the back-stairs , told the crew ,</l>
     <l n="38">“ Old Cato is as great a rogue as you . ”</l>
     <l n="39">Blest paper-credit ! last and best supply !</l>
     <l n="40">That lends corruption lighter wings to fly !</l>
     <l n="41">Gold imped by thee can compass hardest things ,</l>
     <l n="42">Can pocket states , can fetch or carry kings ;</l>
     <l n="43">A single leaf shall waft an army o'er ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or ship off senates to a distant shore ;</l>
     <l n="45">A leaf , like Sibyl 's , scatter to and fro</l>
     <l n="46">Our fates and fortunes , as the winds shall blow :</l>
     <l n="47">Pregnant with thousands flits the scrap unseen ,</l>
     <l n="48">And silent sells a king , or buys a queen .</l>
     <l n="49">Oh ! that such bulky bribes as all might see ,</l>
     <l n="50">Still , as of old , encumbered villainy !</l>
     <l n="51">Could France or Rome divert our brave designs ,</l>
     <l n="52">With all their brandies or with all their wines ?</l>
     <l n="53">What could they more than knights and squires confound ,</l>
     <l n="54">Or water all the Quorum ten miles round ?</l>
     <l n="55">A statesman 's slumbers how this speech would spoil !</l>
     <l n="56">“ Sir , Spain has sent a thousand jars of oil ;</l>
     <l n="57">Huge bales of British cloth blockade the door ;</l>
     <l n="58">A hundred oxen at your levee roar . ”</l>
     <l n="59">Poor Avarice one torment more would find ;</l>
     <l n="60">Nor could Profusion squander all in kind .</l>
     <l n="61">Astride his cheese Sir Morgan might we meet ;</l>
     <l n="62">And Worldly crying coals from street to street ,</l>
     <l n="63">Whom with a wig so wild , and mien so mazed ,</l>
     <l n="64">Pity mistakes for some poor tradesman crazed .</l>
     <l n="65">Had Colepepper 's whole wealth been hops and hogs ,</l>
     <l n="66">Could he himself have sent it to the dogs ?</l>
     <l n="67">His Grace will game : to White 's a bull be led ,</l>
     <l n="68">With spurning heels and with a butting head .</l>
     <l n="69">To White 's be carried , as to ancient games ,</l>
     <l n="70">Fair coursers , vases , and alluring dames .</l>
     <l n="71">Shall then Uxorio , if the stakes he sweep ,</l>
     <l n="72">Bear home six w **** s , and make his lady weep ?</l>
     <l n="73">Or soft Adonis , so perfumed and fine ,</l>
     <l n="74">Drive to St. James 's a whole herd of swine ?</l>
     <l n="75">Oh , filthy cheek on all industrious skill ,</l>
     <l n="76">To spoil the nation 's last great trade , Quadrille !</l>
     <l n="77">Since then , my lord , on such a world we fall ,</l>
     <l n="78">What say you ? B . Say ? Why , take it , gold and all .</l>
     <l n="79">P. What Riches give us let us then inquire :</l>
     <l n="80">Meat , fire , and clothes . B . What more ? P. Meat , clothes , and fire .</l>
     <l n="81">Is this too little ? would you more than live ?</l>
     <l n="82">Alas ! ‘ tis more than Turner finds they give .</l>
     <l n="83">Alas ! ‘ tis more than ( all his visions past )</l>
     <l n="84">Unhappy Wharton , waking , found at last !</l>
     <l n="85">What can they give ? to dying Hopkins , heirs ;</l>
     <l n="86">To Chartres , vigour ; Japhet , nose and ears ?</l>
     <l n="87">Can they in gems bid pallid Hippia glow ,</l>
     <l n="88">In Fulvia 's buckle ease the throbs below ;</l>
     <l n="89">Or heal , old Narses , thy obscener ail ,</l>
     <l n="90">With all th ’ embroid'ry plastered at thy tail ?</l>
     <l n="91">They might ( were Harpax not too wise to spend )</l>
     <l n="92">Give Harpax ’ self the blessing of a friend ;</l>
     <l n="93">Or find some doctor that would save the life</l>
     <l n="94">Of wretched Shylock , spite of Shylock 's wife :</l>
     <l n="95">But thousands die , without or this or that ,</l>
     <l n="96">Die , and endow a college , or a cat .</l>
     <l n="97">To some , indeed , Heaven grants the happier fate ,</l>
     <l n="98">T ’ enrich a bastard , or a son they hate .</l>
     <l n="99">Perhaps you think the poor might have their part ?</l>
     <l n="100">Bond damns the poor , and hates them from his heart :</l>
     <l n="101">The grave Sir Gilbert holds it for a rule ,</l>
     <l n="102">That “ every man in want is knave or fool : ”</l>
     <l n="103">“ God cannot love , ” says Blunt , with tearless eyes ,</l>
     <l n="104">“ The wretch He starves ” — and piously denies :</l>
     <l n="105">But the good bishop , with a meeker air ,</l>
     <l n="106">Admits , and leaves them — Providence 's care .</l>
     <l n="107">Yet , to be just to these poor men of pelf ,</l>
     <l n="108">Each does but hate his neighbour as himself :</l>
     <l n="109">Damned to the mines , an equal fate betides</l>
     <l n="110">The slave that digs it , and the slave that hides .</l>
     <l n="111">B . Who suffer thus , mere charity should own ,</l>
     <l n="112">Must act on motives powerful , though unknown .</l>
     <l n="113">P. Some war , some plague , or famine they foresee ,</l>
     <l n="114">Some revelation hid from you and me .</l>
     <l n="115">Why Shylock wants a meal , the cause is found —</l>
     <l n="116">He thinks a loaf will rise to fifty pound .</l>
     <l n="117">What made directors cheat in South-Sea year ?</l>
     <l n="118">To live on venison when it sold so dear .</l>
     <l n="119">Ask you why Phryne the whole auction buys ?</l>
     <l n="120">Phryne foresees a general excise .</l>
     <l n="121">Why she and Sappho raise that monstrous sum ?</l>
     <l n="122">Alas ! they fear a man will cost a plum .</l>
     <l n="123">Wise Peter sees the world 's respect for gold ,</l>
     <l n="124">And therefore hopes this nation may be sold :</l>
     <l n="125">Glorious ambition ! Peter , swell thy store ,</l>
     <l n="126">And be what Rome 's great Didius was before .</l>
     <l n="127">The crown of Poland , venal twice an age ,</l>
     <l n="128">To just three millions stinted modest Gage .</l>
     <l n="129">But nobler scenes Maria 's dreams unfold ,</l>
     <l n="130">Hereditary realms , and worlds of gold .</l>
     <l n="131">Congenial souls ! whose life one av'rice joins ,</l>
     <l n="132">And one fate buries in th ’ Asturian mines .</l>
     <l n="133">Much injured Blunt ! why bears he Britain 's hate ?</l>
     <l n="134">A wizard told him in these words our fate :</l>
     <l n="135">“ At length corruption , like a gen'ral flood</l>
     <l n="136">( So long by watchful Ministers withstood ) ,</l>
     <l n="137">Shall deluge all ; and av'rice , creeping on ,</l>
     <l n="138">Spread like a low-born mist , and blot the sun ;</l>
     <l n="139">Statesman and patriot ply alike the stocks ,</l>
     <l n="140">Peeress and butler share alike the box ,</l>
     <l n="141">And judges job , and bishops bite the town ,</l>
     <l n="142">And mighty dukes pack cards for half-a-crown .</l>
     <l n="143">See Britain sunk in Lucre 's sordid charms ,</l>
     <l n="144">And France revenged of Anne 's and Edward 's arms ! ”</l>
     <l n="145">‘ Twas no Court-badge , great Scriv'ner ! fired thy brain ,</l>
     <l n="146">Nor lordly luxury , nor City gain :</l>
     <l n="147">No , ‘ twas thy righteous end , ashamed to see</l>
     <l n="148">Senates degen'rate , patriots disagree ,</l>
     <l n="149">And , nobly wishing party-rage to cease ,</l>
     <l n="150">To buy both sides , and give thy country peace .</l>
     <l n="151">“ All this is madness , ” cries a sober sage :</l>
     <l n="152">But who , my friend , has reason in his rage ?</l>
     <l n="153">“ The ruling passion , be it what it will ,</l>
     <l n="154">The ruling passion conquers reason still . ”</l>
     <l n="155">Less mad the wildest whimsey we can frame ,</l>
     <l n="156">Than even that passion , if it has no aim ;</l>
     <l n="157">For though such motives folly you may call ,</l>
     <l n="158">The folly 's greater to have none at all .</l>
     <l n="159">Hear then the truth : “ ‘ Tis Heaven each passion sends ,</l>
     <l n="160">And different men directs to different ends .</l>
     <l n="161">Extremes in nature equal good produce ,</l>
     <l n="162">Extremes in man concur to gen'ral use . ”</l>
     <l n="163">Ask we what makes one keep , and one bestow ?</l>

     <l n="299">In the worst inn 's worst room , with mat half-hung ,</l>
     <l n="300">The floors of plaster , and the walls of dung ,</l>

     <l n="307">Gallant and gay , in Cliveden 's proud alcove ,</l>
     <l n="308">The bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love ;</l>
     <l n="309">Or just as gay , at council , in a ring</l>

     <l n="335">Say , for such worth are other worlds prepared ?</l>
     <l n="336">Or are they both in this their own reward ?</l>
     <l n="337">A knotty point ! to which we now proceed .</l>
     <l n="338">But you are tired — I 'll tell a tale . B . Agreed .</l>
     <l n="339">P. Where London 's column , pointing at the skies ,</l>
     <l n="340">Like a tall bully , lifts the head , and lies ;</l>
     <l n="341">There dwelt a citizen of sober fame ,</l>
     <l n="342">A plain good man , and Balaam was his name ;</l>
     <l n="343">Religious , punctual , frugal , and so forth ;</l>
     <l n="344">His word would pass for more than he was worth .</l>
     <l n="345">One solid dish his week-day meal affords ,</l>
     <l n="346">An added pudding solemnised the Lord 's ;</l>
     <l n="347">Constant at church , and Change ; his gains were sure ,</l>
     <l n="348">His givings rare , save farthings to the poor .</l>
     <l n="349">The devil was piqued such saintship to behold ,</l>

     <l n="353">Roused by the prince of Air , the whirlwinds sweep</l>
     <l n="354">The surge , and plunge his father in the deep ;</l>

     <l n="357">Sir Balaam now , he lives like other folks ,</l>

     <l n="361">Asleep and naked as an Indian lay ,</l>
     <l n="362">An honest factor stole a gem away :</l>

    <head>EPISTLE IV . TO RICHARD BOYLE , EARL OF BURLINGTON .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
     <l n="1">Of the Use of Riches .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Vanity of Expense in people of Wealth and Quality . The abuse of the word Taste , v. 13 . That the first Principle and foundation , in this as in everything else , is Good Sense , v. 40 . The chief Proof of it is to follow Nature even in works of mere Luxury and Elegance . Instanced in Architecture and Gardening , where all must be adapted to the Genius and Use of the Place , and the Beauties not forced into it , but resulting from it , v. 50 . How men are disappointed in their most expensive undertakings , for want of this true Foundation , without which nothing can please long , if at all : and the best Examples and Rules will but be perverted into something burdensome or ridiculous , v. 65 , etc ., to 92 . A description of the false Taste of Magnificence ; the first grand Error of which is to imagine that Greatness consists in the size and dimension , instead of the Proportion and Harmony of the whole , v. 97 , and the second , either in joining together Parts incoherent , or too minutely resembling , or in the Repetition of the same too frequently , v. 105 , etc . A word or two of false Taste in Books , in Music , in Painting , even in Preaching and Prayer , and lastly in Entertainments , v. 133 , etc . Yet Providence is justified in giving Wealth to be squandered in this manner , since it is dispersed to the poor and laborious part of mankind , v. 169 ( recurring to what is laid down in the first book , Ep . ii ., and in the Epistle preceding this , v. 159 , etc . ) . What are the proper objects of Magnificence , and a proper field for the Expense of Great Men , v. 177 , etc ., and finally , the Great and Public Works which become a Prince , v. 191 to the end .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Tis strange , the miser should his cares employ</l>
     <l n="2">To gain those riches he can ne'er enjoy :</l>
     <l n="3">Is it less strange , the prodigal should waste</l>
     <l n="4">His wealth , to purchase what he ne'er can taste ?</l>
     <l n="5">Not for himself he sees , or hears , or eats ;</l>
     <l n="6">Artists must choose his pictures , music , meats :</l>
     <l n="7">He buys for Topham , drawings and designs ,</l>
     <l n="8">For Pembroke , statues , dirty gods , and coins ;</l>
     <l n="9">Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone ,</l>
     <l n="10">And books for Mead , and butterflies for Sloane .</l>
     <l n="11">Think we all these are for himself ? no more</l>
     <l n="12">Than his fine wife , alas ! or finer w *** e .</l>
     <l n="13">For what has Virro painted , built , and planted ?</l>
     <l n="14">Only to show , how many tastes he wanted .</l>
     <l n="15">What brought Sir Visto 's ill-got wealth to waste ?</l>
     <l n="16">Some demon whispered , “ Visto ! have a taste . ”</l>
     <l n="17">Heaven visits with a taste the wealthy fool ,</l>
     <l n="18">And needs no rod but Ripley with a rule .</l>
     <l n="19">See ! sportive Fate , to punish awkward pride ,</l>
     <l n="20">Bids Bubo build , and sends him such a guide .</l>
     <l n="21">A standing sermon , at each year 's expense ,</l>
     <l n="22">That never coxcomb reached magnificence !</l>
     <l n="23">You show us , Rome was glorious , not profuse ,</l>
     <l n="24">And pompous buildings once were things of use .</l>
     <l n="25">Yet shall , my lord , your just , your noble rules</l>
     <l n="26">Fill half the land with imitating fools ;</l>
     <l n="27">Who random drawings from your sheets shall take ,</l>
     <l n="28">And of one beauty many blunders make ;</l>
     <l n="29">Load some vain church with old theatric state ,</l>
     <l n="30">Turn arcs of triumph to a garden-gate ;</l>
     <l n="31">Reverse your ornaments , and hang them all</l>
     <l n="32">On some patched dog-hole eked with ends of wall ;</l>
     <l n="33">Then clap four slices of pilaster on ‘ t ,</l>
     <l n="34">That , laced with bits of rustic , makes a front</l>
     <l n="35">Shall call the winds through long arcades to roar ,</l>
     <l n="36">Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door ;</l>
     <l n="37">Conscious they act a true Palladian part ,</l>
     <l n="38">And , if they starve , they starve by rules of art .</l>
     <l n="39">Oft have you hinted to your brother peer</l>
     <l n="40">A certain truth , which many buy too dear :</l>
     <l n="41">Something there is more needful than expense ,</l>
     <l n="42">And something previous even to taste — ‘ tis sense .</l>
     <l n="43">Good sense , which only is the gift of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="44">And though no science , fairly worth the seven :</l>
     <l n="45">A light , which in yourself you must perceive :</l>
     <l n="46">Jones and Le Notre have it not to give .</l>
     <l n="47">To build , to plant , whatever you intend ,</l>
     <l n="48">To rear the column , or the arch to bend ,</l>
     <l n="49">To swell the terrace , or to sink the grot ;</l>
     <l n="50">In all , let Nature never be forgot .</l>
     <l n="51">But treat the goddess like a modest fair ,</l>
     <l n="52">Nor over-dress , nor leave her wholly bare ;</l>
     <l n="53">Let not each beauty everywhere be spied ,</l>
     <l n="54">Where half the skill is decently to hide .</l>
     <l n="55">He gains all points , who pleasingly confounds ,</l>
     <l n="56">Surprises , varies , and conceals the bounds .</l>
     <l n="57">Consult the genius of the place in all ;</l>
     <l n="58">That tells the waters or to rise or fall ,</l>
     <l n="59">Or helps the ambitious hill the heavens to scale ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or scoops in circling theatres the vale ;</l>
     <l n="61">Calls in the country , catches opening glades ,</l>
     <l n="62">Joins willing woods , and varies shades from shades ;</l>
     <l n="63">Now breaks , or now directs , the intending lines ;</l>
     <l n="64">Paints as you plant , and , as you work , designs .</l>
     <l n="65">Still follow sense , of every art the soul ,</l>
     <l n="66">Parts answering parts shall slide into a whole ,</l>
     <l n="67">Spontaneous beauties all around advance ,</l>
     <l n="68">Start even from difficulty , strike from chance ;</l>
     <l n="69">Nature shall join you ; Time shall make it grow</l>
     <l n="70">A work to wonder at — perhaps a Stowe .</l>
     <l n="71">Without it , proud Versailles , thy glory falls ;</l>
     <l n="72">And Nero 's terraces desert their walls :</l>
     <l n="73">The vast parterres a thousand hands shall make ;</l>
     <l n="74">Lo ! Cobham comes , and floats them with a lake :</l>
     <l n="75">Or cut wide views through mountains to the plain ,</l>
     <l n="76">You 'll wish your hill or sheltered seat again .</l>
     <l n="77">Even in an ornament its place remark ,</l>
     <l n="78">Nor in a hermitage set Dr. Clarke .</l>
     <l n="79">Behold Villario 's ten years ’ toil complete :</l>
     <l n="80">His quincunx darkens , his espaliers meet ;</l>
     <l n="81">The wood supports the plain , the parts unite ,</l>
     <l n="82">And strength of shade contends with strength of light ;</l>
     <l n="83">A waving glow the bloomy beds display ,</l>
     <l n="84">Blushing in bright diversities of day ,</l>
     <l n="85">With silver-quivering rills meandered o'er —</l>
     <l n="86">Enjoy them , you ! Villario can no more ;</l>
     <l n="87">Tired of the scene parterres and fountains yield ,</l>
     <l n="88">He finds at last he better likes a field .</l>
     <l n="89">Through his young woods how pleased Sabinus strayed ,</l>
     <l n="90">Or sat delighted in the thickening shade ,</l>
     <l n="91">With annual joy the reddening shoots to greet ,</l>
     <l n="92">Or see the stretching branches long to meet !</l>
     <l n="93">His son 's fine taste an opener vista loves ,</l>
     <l n="94">Foe to the Dryads of his father 's groves ;</l>
     <l n="95">One boundless green , or flourished carpet views ,</l>
     <l n="96">With all the mournful family of yews ;</l>
     <l n="97">The thriving plants , ignoble broomsticks made ,</l>
     <l n="98">Now sweep those alleys they were born to shade .</l>
     <l n="99">At Timon 's villa let us pass a day ,</l>
     <l n="100">Where all cry out , “ What sums are thrown away ! ”</l>
     <l n="101">So proud , so grand ; of that stupendous air ,</l>
     <l n="102">Soft and agreeable come never there .</l>
     <l n="103">Greatness , with Timon , dwells in such a draught</l>
     <l n="104">As brings all Brobdingnag before your thought .</l>
     <l n="105">To compass this , his building is a town ,</l>
     <l n="106">His pond an ocean , his parterre a down :</l>
     <l n="107">Who but must laugh , the master when he sees ,</l>
     <l n="108">A puny insect , shivering at a breeze !</l>
     <l n="109">Lo , what huge heaps of littleness around !</l>
     <l n="110">The whole , a laboured quarry above ground ;</l>
     <l n="111">Two Cupids squirt before ; a lake behind</l>
     <l n="112">Improves the keenness of the northern wind .</l>
     <l n="113">His gardens next your admiration call ,</l>
     <l n="114">On every side you look , behold the wall !</l>
     <l n="115">No pleasing intricacies intervene ,</l>
     <l n="116">No artful wildness to perplex the scene ;</l>
     <l n="117">Grove nods at grove , each alley has a brother ,</l>
     <l n="118">And half the platform just reflects the other .</l>
     <l n="119">The suffering eye inverted Nature sees ,</l>
     <l n="120">Trees cut to statues , statues thick as trees</l>
     <l n="121">With here a fountain , never to be played ;</l>
     <l n="122">And there a summer-house , that knows no shade ;</l>
     <l n="123">Here Amphitrite sails through myrtle bowers ;</l>
     <l n="124">There gladiators fight or die in flowers ;</l>
     <l n="125">Unwatered see the drooping sea-horse mourn ,</l>
     <l n="126">And swallows roost in Nilus ’ dusty urn .</l>
     <l n="127">My lord advances with majestic mien ,</l>
     <l n="128">Smit with the mighty pleasure to be seen :</l>
     <l n="129">But soft — by regular approach — not yet —</l>
     <l n="130">First through the length of yon hot terrace sweat ;</l>
     <l n="131">And when up ten steep slopes you 've dragged your thighs ,</l>
     <l n="132">Just at his study door he 'll bless your eyes .</l>
     <l n="133">His study ! with what authors is it stored ?</l>
     <l n="134">In books , not authors , curious is my lord ;</l>
     <l n="135">To all their dated backs he turns you round :</l>
     <l n="136">These Aldus printed , those Du Sueil has bound ,</l>
     <l n="137">Lo , some are vellum , and the rest as good</l>
     <l n="138">For all his lordship knows , but they are wood .</l>
     <l n="139">For Locke or Milton ‘ tis in vain to look ;</l>
     <l n="140">These shelves admit not any modern book .</l>
     <l n="141">And now the chapel 's silver bell you hear ,</l>
     <l n="142">That summons you to all the pride of prayer ;</l>
     <l n="143">Light quirks of music , broken and uneven ,</l>
     <l n="144">Make the soul dance upon a jig to heaven .</l>
     <l n="145">On painted ceilings you devoutly stare ,</l>
     <l n="146">Where sprawl the saints of Verrio or Laguerre ,</l>
     <l n="147">On gilded clouds in fair expansion lie ,</l>
     <l n="148">And bring all Paradise before your eye .</l>
     <l n="149">To rest , the cushion and soft Dean invite ,</l>
     <l n="150">Who never mentions hell to ears polite .</l>
     <l n="151">But hark ! the chiming clocks to dinner call ;</l>
     <l n="152">A hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall :</l>
     <l n="153">The rich buffet well-coloured serpents grace ,</l>
     <l n="154">And gaping Tritons spew to wash your face .</l>
     <l n="155">Is this a dinner ? this a genial room ?</l>
     <l n="156">No , ‘ tis a temple , and a hecatomb .</l>
     <l n="157">A solemn sacrifice , performed in state ,</l>
     <l n="158">You drink by measure , and to minutes eat .</l>
     <l n="159">So quick retires each flying course , you 'd swear</l>
     <l n="160">Sancho 's dread doctor and his wand were there .</l>
     <l n="161">Between each act the trembling salvers ring ,</l>
     <l n="162">From soup to sweet-wine , and God bless the King .</l>
     <l n="163">In plenty starving , tantalised in state ,</l>
     <l n="164">And complaisantly helped to all I hate ,</l>
     <l n="165">Treated , caressed , and tired , I take my leave ,</l>
     <l n="166">Sick of his civil pride from morn to eve ;</l>
     <l n="167">I curse such lavish cost and little skill ,</l>
     <l n="168">And swear no day was ever past so ill .</l>
     <l n="169">Yet hence the poor are clothed , the hungry fed ;</l>
     <l n="170">Health to himself , and to his infants bread</l>
     <l n="171">The labourer bears ; what his hard heart denies</l>
     <l n="172">His charitable vanity supplies .</l>
     <l n="173">Another age shall see the golden ear</l>
     <l n="174">Embrown the slope , and nod on the parterre ,</l>
     <l n="175">Deep harvests bury all his pride has planned ,</l>
     <l n="176">And laughing Ceres re-assume the land .</l>
     <l n="177">Who then shall grace , or who improve the soil ?</l>
     <l n="178">Who plants like Bathurst , or who builds like Boyle .</l>
     <l n="179">‘ Tis use alone that sanctifies expense ,</l>
     <l n="180">And splendour borrows all her rays from sense .</l>
     <l n="181">His father 's acres who enjoys in peace ,</l>
     <l n="182">Or makes his neighbours glad , if he increase :</l>
     <l n="183">Whose cheerful tenants bless their yearly toil ,</l>
     <l n="184">Yet to their lord owe more than to the soil ;</l>
     <l n="185">Whose ample lawns are not ashamed to feed</l>
     <l n="186">The milky heifer and deserving steed ;</l>
     <l n="187">Whose rising forests , not for pride or show ,</l>
     <l n="188">But future buildings , future navies , grow :</l>
     <l n="189">Let his plantations stretch from down to down ,</l>
     <l n="190">First shade a country , and then raise a town .</l>
     <l n="191">You too proceed ! make falling arts your care ,</l>
     <l n="192">Erect new wonders , and the old repair ;</l>
     <l n="193">Jones and Palladio to themselves restore ,</l>
     <l n="194">And be whate'er Vitruvius was before :</l>
     <l n="195">‘ Till kings call forth the ideas of your mind</l>
     <l n="196">( Proud to accomplish what such hands denied )</l>
     <l n="197">Bid harbours open , public ways extend ,</l>
     <l n="198">Bid temples , worthier of the god , ascend ;</l>
     <l n="199">Bid the broad arch the dangerous flood contain ,</l>
     <l n="200">The mole projected break the roaring main ;</l>
     <l n="201">Back to his bounds their subject sea command ,</l>
     <l n="202">And roll obedient rivers through the land :</l>
     <l n="203">These honours peace to happy Britain brings ,</l>
     <l n="204">These are imperial works , and worthy kings .</l>

     <l n="5">The very tombs now vanished like their dead !</l>

     <l n="8">Huge theatres , that now unpeopled woods ,</l>
     <l n="9">Now drained a distant country of her floods :</l>
     <l n="10">Fanes , which admiring gods with pride survey ,</l>
     <l n="11">Statues of men , scarce less alive than they !</l>

     <l n="23">Their ruins perished , and their place no more ;</l>

     <l n="29">And scarce are seen the prostrate Nile or Rhine ;</l>

     <l n="32">The medal , faithful to its charge of fame ,</l>

    <head>SATIRES .</head>
    <head>EPISTLE TO DR. ARBUTHNOT .</head>
     <l n="1">ADVERTISEMENT</l>
     <l n="2">To the first publication of this Epistle .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This Paper is a sort of bill of complaint , begun many years since , and drawn up by snatches , as the several occasions offered . I had no thoughts of publishing it , till it pleased some persons of rank and fortune ( the authors of “ Verses to the Imitator of Horace , ” and of an “ Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court ” ) to attack , in a very extraordinary manner , not only my writings ( of which , being public , the public is judge ) , but my person , morals , and family , whereof , to those who know me not , a truer information may be requisite . Being divided between the necessity to say something of myself , and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task , I thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this Epistle . If it have anything pleasing , it will be that by which I am most desirous to please , the truth and the sentiment ; and if anything offensive , it will be only to those I am least sorry to offend , the vicious or the ungenerous .</p>
   <p>Many will know their own pictures in it , there being not a circumstance but what is true ; but I have , for the most part , spared their names , and they may escape being laughed at if they please .</p>
   <p>I would have some of them know , it was owing to the request of the learned and candid friend to whom it is inscribed , that I make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine . However , I shall have this advantage and honour on my side , that whereas , by their proceeding , any abuse may be directed at any man , no injury can possibly be done by mine , since a nameless character can never be found out but by its truth and likeness .— P .</p>
   <p>EPISTLE TO DR. ARBUTHNOT , BEING THE PROLOGUE TO THE SATIRES .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">P. Shut , shut the door , good John ! fatigued , I said ,</l>
     <l n="2">Tie up the knocker , say I 'm sick , I 'm dead .</l>
     <l n="3">The dog-star rages ! nay ‘ tis past a doubt ,</l>
     <l n="4">All Bedlam , or Parnassus , is let out :</l>
     <l n="5">Fire in each eye , and papers in each hand ,</l>
     <l n="6">They rave , recite , and madden round the land .</l>
     <l n="7">What walls can guard me , or what shades can hide ?</l>
     <l n="8">They pierce my thickets , through my grot they glide ;</l>
     <l n="9">By land , by water , they renew the charge ;</l>
     <l n="10">They stop the chariot , and they board the barge .</l>
     <l n="11">No place is sacred , not the Church is free ;</l>
     <l n="12">Even Sunday shines no Sabbath Day to me ;</l>
     <l n="13">Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="14">Happy to catch me just at dinner-time .</l>
     <l n="15">Is there a parson , much bemused in beer ,</l>
     <l n="16">A maudlin poetess , a rhyming peer ,</l>
     <l n="17">A clerk , foredoomed his father 's soul to cross ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who pens a stanza when he should engross ?</l>
     <l n="19">Is there , who , locked from ink and paper , scrawls</l>
     <l n="20">With desperate charcoal round his darkened walls ?</l>
     <l n="21">All fly to Twitenham , and in humble strain</l>
     <l n="22">Apply to me , to keep them mad or vain .</l>
     <l n="23">Arthur , whose giddy son neglects the laws ,</l>
     <l n="24">Imputes to me and my damned works the cause :</l>
     <l n="25">Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope ,</l>
     <l n="26">And curses wit , and poetry , and Pope .</l>
     <l n="27">Friend to my life ! ( which did not you prolong ,</l>
     <l n="28">The world had wanted many an idle song )</l>
     <l n="29">What drop or nostrum can this plague remove ?</l>
     <l n="30">Or which must end me , a fool 's wrath or love ?</l>
     <l n="31">A dire dilemma ! either way I 'm sped ,</l>
     <l n="32">If foes , they write , if friends , they read me dead .</l>
     <l n="33">Seized and tied down to judge , how wretched I !</l>
     <l n="34">Who can n't be silent , and who will not lie .</l>
     <l n="35">To laugh , were want of goodness and of grace ,</l>
     <l n="36">And to be grave , exceeds all power of face .</l>
     <l n="37">I sit with sad civility , I read</l>
     <l n="38">With honest anguish , and an aching head ;</l>
     <l n="39">And drop at last , but in unwilling ears ,</l>
     <l n="40">This saving counsel , “ Keep your piece nine years . ”</l>
     <l n="41">“ Nine years ! ” cries he , who high in Drury Lane ,</l>
     <l n="42">Lulled by soft zephyrs through the broken pane ,</l>
     <l n="43">Rhymes ere he wakes , and prints before term ends ,</l>
     <l n="44">Obliged by hunger , and request of friends :</l>
     <l n="45">“ The piece , you think , is incorrect ? why , take it ,</l>
     <l n="46">I 'm all submission , what you 'd have it , make it . ”</l>

     <l n="342">That not for fame , but virtue 's better end ,</l>
     <l n="343">He stood the furious foe , the timid friend ,</l>
     <l n="344">The damning critic , half approving wit ,</l>
     <l n="345">The coxcomb hit , or fearing to be hit ;</l>
     <l n="346">Laughed at the loss of friends he never had ,</l>
     <l n="347">The dull , the proud , the wicked , and the mad ;</l>
     <l n="348">The distant threats of vengeance on his head ,</l>
     <l n="349">The blow unfelt , the tear he never shed ;</l>
     <l n="350">The tale revived , the lie so oft o'erthrown ,</l>
     <l n="351">The imputed trash , and dulness not his own ;</l>
     <l n="352">The morals blackened when the writings scape ,</l>
     <l n="353">The libelled person , and the pictured shape ;</l>
     <l n="354">Abuse , on all he loved , or loved him , spread ,</l>
     <l n="355">A friend in exile , or a father , dead ;</l>
     <l n="356">The whisper , that to greatness still too near ,</l>
     <l n="357">Perhaps , yet vibrates , on his sovereign 's ear :—</l>
     <l n="358">Welcome for thee , fair virtue ! all the past ;</l>
     <l n="359">For thee , fair virtue ! welcome even the last !</l>
     <l n="360">A . But why insult the poor , affront the great ?</l>
     <l n="361">P. A knave 's a knave , to me in every state :</l>
     <l n="362">Alike my scorn , if he succeed or fail ,</l>
     <l n="363">Sporus at Court , or Japhet in a jail ,</l>
     <l n="364">A hireling scribbler , or a hireling peer ,</l>
     <l n="365">Knight of the post corrupt , or of the shire ;</l>
     <l n="366">If on a pillory , or near a throne ,</l>
     <l n="367">He gain his prince 's ear , or lose his own .</l>
     <l n="368">Yet soft by nature , more a dupe than wit ,</l>
     <l n="369">Sappho can tell you how this man was bit ;</l>
     <l n="370">This dreaded satirist Dennis will confess</l>
     <l n="371">Foe to his pride , but friend to his distress :</l>
     <l n="372">So humble , he has knocked at Tibbald 's door ,</l>
     <l n="373">Has drunk with Cibber , nay has rhymed for Moore .</l>
     <l n="374">Full ten years slandered , did he once reply ?</l>
     <l n="375">Three thousand sons went down on Welsted 's lie .</l>
     <l n="376">To please a mistress one aspersed his life ;</l>
     <l n="377">He lashed him not , but let her be his wife .</l>
     <l n="378">Let Budgel charge low Grubstreet on his quill ,</l>
     <l n="379">And write whate'er he pleased , except his will ;</l>
     <l n="380">Let the two Curlls of town and court abuse</l>
     <l n="381">His father , mother , body , soul , and muse .</l>
     <l n="382">Yet why ? that father held it for a rule ,</l>
     <l n="383">It was a sin to call our neighbour fool :</l>
     <l n="384">That harmless mother thought no wife a w *** e :</l>
     <l n="385">Hear this , and spare his family , James Moore !</l>
     <l n="386">Unspotted names , and memorable long !</l>
     <l n="387">If there be force in virtue , or in song .</l>
     <l n="388">Of gentle blood ( part shed in honour 's cause</l>
     <l n="389">While yet in Britain honour had applause )</l>
     <l n="390">Each parent sprung — A . What fortune , pray ?— P. Their own ,</l>
     <l n="391">And better got , than Bestia 's from the throne .</l>
     <l n="392">Born to no pride , inheriting no strife ,</l>
     <l n="393">Nor marrying discord in a noble wife ,</l>
     <l n="394">Stranger to civil and religious rage ,</l>
     <l n="395">The good man walked innoxious through his age .</l>
     <l n="396">Nor courts he saw , no suits would ever try ,</l>
     <l n="397">Nor dared an oath , nor hazarded a lie .</l>
     <l n="398">Unlearned he knew no schoolman 's subtle art ,</l>
     <l n="399">No language , but the language of the heart .</l>
     <l n="400">By nature honest , by experience wise ,</l>
     <l n="401">Healthy by temperance , and by exercise ;</l>
     <l n="402">His life , though long , to sickness past unknown ,</l>
     <l n="403">His death was instant , and without a groan .</l>
     <l n="404">O grant me thus to live , and thus to die !</l>
     <l n="405">Who sprung from kings shall know less joy than I .</l>
     <l n="406">O friend ! may each domestic bliss be thine !</l>
     <l n="407">Be no unpleasing melancholy mine :</l>
     <l n="408">Me , let the tender office long engage ,</l>
     <l n="409">To rock the cradle of reposing age ,</l>
     <l n="410">With lenient arts extend a mother 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="411">Make languor smile , and smooth the bed of death ,</l>
     <l n="412">Explore the thought , explain the asking eye ,</l>
     <l n="413">And keep a while one parent from the sky !</l>
     <l n="414">On cares like these if length of days attend ,</l>
     <l n="415">May Heaven , to bless those days , preserve my friend ,</l>
     <l n="416">Preserve him social , cheerful , and serene ,</l>
     <l n="417">And just as rich as when he served a queen .</l>
     <l n="418">A . Whether that blessing be denied or given ,</l>
     <l n="419">Thus far was right , the rest belongs to Heaven .</l>

    <head>SATIRES AND EPISTLES OF HORACE IMITATED .</head>
    <head>ADVERTISEMENT .</head>
    <head>The occasion of publishing these Imitations was the clamour raised on some of my Epistles . An answer from Horace was both more full , and of more dignity , than any I could have made in my own person ; and the example of much greater freedom in so eminent a divine as Dr. Donne , seemed a proof with what indignation and contempt a Christian may treat vice or folly , in ever so low , or ever so high a station . Both these authors were acceptable to the princes and ministers under whom they lived . The Satires of Dr. Donne I versified , at the desire of the Earl of Oxford while he was Lord Treasurer , and of the Duke of Shrewsbury who had been Secretary of State , neither of whom looked upon a satire on vicious courts as any reflection on those they served in . And indeed there is not in the world a greater error , than that which fools are so apt to fall into , and knaves with good reason to encourage , the mistaking a satirist for a libeller ; whereas to a true satirist nothing is so odious as a libeller , for the same reason as to a man truly virtuous nothing is so hateful as a hypocrite .</head>

    <head>THE FIRST SATIRE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF HORACE .</head>
    <head>SATIRE I . TO MR. FORTESCUE .</head>
     <l n="1">P. There are ( I scarce can think it , but am told ) ,</l>
     <l n="2">There are , to whom my satire seems too bold :</l>
     <l n="3">Scarce to wise Peter complaisant enough ,</l>
     <l n="4">And something said of Chartres much too rough .</l>
     <l n="5">The lines are weak another 's pleased to say ,</l>
     <l n="6">Lord Fanny spins a thousand such a day .</l>
     <l n="7">Timorous by nature , of the rich in awe ,</l>
     <l n="8">I come to counsel learned in the law :</l>
     <l n="9">You 'll give me , like a friend both sage and free ,</l>
     <l n="10">Advice ; and ( as you use ) without a fee .</l>
     <l n="11">F. I 'd write no more . P. Not write ? but then I think ,</l>
     <l n="12">And for my soul I cannot sleep a wink .</l>
     <l n="13">I nod in company , I wake at night ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fools rush into my head , and so I write .</l>
     <l n="15">F. You could not do a worse thing for your life .</l>
     <l n="16">Why , if the nights seem tedious — take a wife :</l>
     <l n="17">Or rather truly , if your point be rest ,</l>
     <l n="18">Lettuce and cowslip wine : Probatum est .</l>
     <l n="19">But talk with Celsus , Celsus will advise</l>
     <l n="20">Hartshorn , or something that shall close your eyes .</l>
     <l n="21">Or , if you needs must write , write Caesar 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="22">You 'll gain at least a knighthood , or the bays .</l>
     <l n="23">P. What ? like Sir Richard , rumbling , rough , and fierce ,</l>
     <l n="24">With arms , and George , and Brunswick crowd the verse ,</l>
     <l n="25">Rend with tremendous sound your ears asunder ,</l>
     <l n="26">With gun , drum , trumpet , blunderbuss , and thunder ?</l>
     <l n="27">Or nobly wild , with Budgel 's fire and force ,</l>
     <l n="28">Paint angels trembling round his falling horse ?</l>
     <l n="29">F. Then all your muse 's softer art display ,</l>
     <l n="30">Let Carolina smooth the tuneful lay ,</l>
     <l n="31">Lull with Amelia 's liquid name the nine ,</l>
     <l n="32">And sweetly flow through all the royal line .</l>
     <l n="33">P. Alas ! few verses touch their nicer ear ;</l>
     <l n="34">They scarce can bear their laureate twice a year ;</l>
     <l n="35">And justly Caesar scorns the poet 's lays :</l>
     <l n="36">It is to history he trusts for praise .</l>
     <l n="37">F. Better be Cibber , I 'll maintain it still ,</l>
     <l n="38">Than ridicule all taste , blaspheme quadrille ,</l>
     <l n="39">Abuse the city 's best good men in metre ,</l>
     <l n="40">And laugh at peers that put their trust in Peter .</l>
     <l n="41">Even those you touch not , hate you . P. What should ail ‘ em ?</l>
     <l n="42">F. A hundred smart in Timon and in Balaam :</l>
     <l n="43">The fewer still you name , you wound the more ;</l>
     <l n="44">Bond is but one , but Harpax is a score .</l>
     <l n="45">P. Each mortal has his pleasure : none deny</l>
     <l n="46">Scarsdale his bottle , Darty his ham-pie ;</l>
     <l n="47">Ridotta sips and dances , till she see</l>
     <l n="48">The doubling lustres dance as fast as she ;</l>
     <l n="49">F —— loves the senate , Hockley-hole his brother ,</l>
     <l n="50">Like in all else , as one egg to another .</l>
     <l n="51">I love to pour out all myself , as plain</l>
     <l n="52">As downright Shippen , or as old Montaigne :</l>
     <l n="53">In them , as certain to be loved as seen ,</l>
     <l n="54">The soul stood forth , nor kept a thought within ;</l>
     <l n="55">In me what spots ( for spots I have ) appear ,</l>
     <l n="56">Will prove at least the medium must be clear .</l>
     <l n="57">In this impartial glass , my muse intends</l>
     <l n="58">Fair to expose myself , my foes , my friends ;</l>
     <l n="59">Publish the present age ; but where my text</l>
     <l n="60">Is vice too high , reserve it for the next :</l>
     <l n="61">My foes shall wish my life a longer date ,</l>
     <l n="62">And every friend the less lament my fate .</l>
     <l n="63">My head and heart thus flowing through my quill ,</l>
     <l n="64">Verse-man or prose-man , term me which you will ,</l>
     <l n="65">Papist or Protestant , or both between ,</l>
     <l n="66">Like good Erasmus in an honest mean ,</l>
     <l n="67">In moderation placing all my glory ,</l>
     <l n="68">While Tories call me Whig , and Whigs a Tory .</l>
     <l n="69">Satire 's my weapon , but I 'm too discreet</l>
     <l n="70">To run a muck , and tilt at all I meet ;</l>
     <l n="71">I only wear it in a land of Hectors ,</l>
     <l n="72">Thieves , supercargoes , sharpers , and directors .</l>
     <l n="73">Save but our army ! and let Jove encrust</l>
     <l n="74">Swords , pikes , and guns , with everlasting rust !</l>
     <l n="75">Peace is my dear delight — not Fleury 's more :</l>
     <l n="76">But touch me , and no minister so sore .</l>
     <l n="77">Whoe'er offends , at some unlucky time</l>
     <l n="78">Slides into verse , and hitches in a rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="79">Sacred to ridicule his whole life long ,</l>
     <l n="80">And the sad burthen of some merry song .</l>
     <l n="81">Slander or poison dread from Delia 's rage</l>
     <l n="82">Hard words or hanging , if your judge be Page .</l>
     <l n="83">From furious Sappho scarce a milder fate ,</l>
     <l n="84">Plagued by her love , or libelled by her hate .</l>
     <l n="85">Its proper power to hurt , each creature feels ;</l>
     <l n="86">Bulls aim their horns , and asses lift their heels ;</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Tis a bear 's talent not to kick , but hug ;</l>
     <l n="88">And no man wonders he 's not stung by pug .</l>
     <l n="89">So drink with Walters , or with Chartres eat ,</l>
     <l n="90">They 'll never poison you , they 'll only cheat .</l>
     <l n="91">Then , learned sir ! ( to cut the matter short )</l>
     <l n="92">Whate'er my fate , or well or ill at Court ,</l>
     <l n="93">Whether old age , with faint but cheerful ray ,</l>
     <l n="94">Attends to gild the evening of my day ,</l>
     <l n="95">Or death 's black wing already be displayed ,</l>
     <l n="96">To wrap me in the universal shade ;</l>
     <l n="97">Whether the darkened room to muse invite ,</l>
     <l n="98">Or whitened wall provoke the skewer to write :</l>
     <l n="99">In durance , exile , Bedlam or the Mint —</l>
     <l n="100">Like Lee or Budgel , I will rhyme and print .</l>
     <l n="101">F. Alas , young man ! your days can ne'er be long ,</l>
     <l n="102">In flower of age you perish for a song !</l>
     <l n="103">Plums and directors , Shylock and his wife ,</l>
     <l n="104">Will club their testers , now , to take your life !</l>
     <l n="105">P. What ? armed for virtue when I point the pen ,</l>
     <l n="106">Brand the bold front of shameless guilty men ;</l>
     <l n="107">Dash the proud gamester in his gilded car ;</l>
     <l n="108">Bare the mean heart that lurks beneath a star ;</l>
     <l n="109">Can there be wanting , to defend her cause ,</l>
     <l n="110">Lights of the Church , or guardians of the laws ?</l>
     <l n="111">Could pensioned Boileau lash in honest strain</l>
     <l n="112">Flatterers and bigots even in Louis ’ reign ?</l>
     <l n="113">Could Laureate Dryden pimp and friar engage ,</l>
     <l n="114">Yet neither Charles nor James be in a rage ?</l>
     <l n="115">And I not strip the gilding off a knave ,</l>
     <l n="116">Unplaced , unpensioned , no man 's heir , or slave ?</l>
     <l n="117">I will , or perish in the generous cause :</l>
     <l n="118">Hear this , and tremble ! you , who ‘ scape the laws .</l>
     <l n="119">Yes , while I live , no rich or noble knave</l>
     <l n="120">Shall walk the world , in credit , to his grave .</l>
     <l n="121">To Virtue only and her friends a friend ,</l>
     <l n="122">The world beside may murmur , or commend .</l>
     <l n="123">Know , all the distant din that world can keep</l>
     <l n="124">Rolls o'er my grotto , and but soothes my sleep .</l>
     <l n="125">There , my retreat the best companions grace ,</l>
     <l n="126">Chiefs out of war , and statesmen out of place .</l>
     <l n="127">There St. John mingles with my friendly bowl</l>
     <l n="128">The feast of reason and the flow of soul :</l>
     <l n="129">And he , whose lightning pierced the Iberian lines ,</l>
     <l n="130">Now forms my quincunx , and now ranks my vines</l>
     <l n="131">Or tames the genius of the stubborn plain ,</l>
     <l n="132">Almost as quickly as he conquered Spain .</l>
     <l n="133">Envy must own , I live among the great ,</l>
     <l n="134">No pimp of pleasure , and no spy of state .</l>
     <l n="135">With eyes that pry not , tongue that ne'er repeats ,</l>
     <l n="136">Fond to spread friendships , but to cover heats ;</l>
     <l n="137">To help who want , to forward who excel ;</l>
     <l n="138">This , all who know me , know ; who love me , tell ;</l>
     <l n="139">And who unknown defame me , let them be</l>
     <l n="140">Scribblers or peers , alike are mob to me .</l>
     <l n="141">This is my plea , on this I rest my cause —</l>
     <l n="142">What saith my counsel , learned in the laws ?</l>
     <l n="143">F. Your plea is good ; but still I say , beware !</l>
     <l n="144">Laws are explained by men — so have a care .</l>
     <l n="145">It stands on record , that in Richard 's times</l>
     <l n="146">A man was hanged for very honest rhymes .</l>
     <l n="147">Consult the Statute : quart . I think it is ,</l>
     <l n="148">Edwardi sext . or prim . et quint . Eliz .</l>
     <l n="149">See libels , satires — here you have it — read .</l>
     <l n="150">P. Libels and satires ! lawless things indeed !</l>
     <l n="151">But grave epistles , bringing vice to light ,</l>
     <l n="152">Such as a king might read , a bishop write ;</l>
     <l n="153">Such as Sir Robert would approve — F. Indeed ?</l>
     <l n="154">The case is altered — you may then proceed ;</l>
     <l n="155">In such a cause the plaintiff would be hissed ;</l>

    <head>THE SECOND SATIRE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF HORACE .</head>
    <head>SATIRE II . TO MR. BETHEL .</head>
     <l n="1">What , and how great , the virtue and the art</l>
     <l n="2">To live on little with a cheerful heart</l>
     <l n="3">( A doctrine sage , but truly none of mine ) ,</l>
     <l n="4">Let 's talk , my friends , but talk before we dine .</l>
     <l n="5">Not when a gilt buffet 's reflected pride</l>
     <l n="6">Turns you from sound philosophy aside ;</l>
     <l n="7">Not when from plate to plate your eyeballs roll ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the brain dances to the mantling bowl .</l>
     <l n="9">Hear Bethel 's sermon , one not versed in schools ,</l>
     <l n="10">But strong in sense , and wise without the rules .</l>
     <l n="11">Go work , hunt , exercise ! ( he thus began )</l>
     <l n="12">Then scorn a homely dinner , if you can .</l>
     <l n="13">Your wine locked up , your butler strolled abroad ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or fish denied ( the river yet unthawed ) ,</l>
     <l n="15">If then plain bread and milk will do the feat ,</l>
     <l n="16">The pleasure lies in you , and not the meat .</l>
     <l n="17">Preach as I please , I doubt our curious men</l>
     <l n="18">Will choose a pheasant still before a hen ;</l>
     <l n="19">Yet hens of Guinea full as good I hold ,</l>
     <l n="20">Except you eat the feathers green and gold .</l>
     <l n="21">Of carps and mullets why prefer the great</l>
     <l n="22">( Though cut in pieces ere my lord can eat ) ,</l>
     <l n="23">Yet for small turbots such esteem profess ?</l>
     <l n="24">Because God made these large , the other less .</l>
     <l n="25">Oldfield with more than harpy throat endued ,</l>
     <l n="26">Cries “ Send me , gods ! a whole hog barbecued !</l>
     <l n="27">Oh , b —— it , south-winds ! till a stench exhale</l>
     <l n="28">Rank as the ripeness of a rabbit 's tail .</l>
     <l n="29">By what criterion do ye eat , d'ye think ,</l>
     <l n="30">If this is prized for sweetness , that for stink ? ”</l>
     <l n="31">When the tired glutton labours through a treat ,</l>
     <l n="32">He finds no relish in the sweetest meat ,</l>
     <l n="33">He calls for something bitter , something sour ,</l>
     <l n="34">And the rich feast concludes extremely poor :</l>
     <l n="35">Cheap eggs , and herbs , and olives still we see ;</l>
     <l n="36">Thus much is left of old simplicity !</l>
     <l n="37">The robin-redbreast till of late had rest ,</l>
     <l n="38">And children sacred held a martin 's nest ,</l>
     <l n="39">Till becca-ficos sold so devilish dear</l>
     <l n="40">To one that was , or would have been a peer .</l>
     <l n="41">Let me extol a cat , on oysters fed ,</l>
     <l n="42">I 'll have a party at the Bedford-head ;</l>
     <l n="43">Or even to crack live crawfish recommend ;</l>
     <l n="44">I 'd never doubt at Court to make a friend .</l>
     <l n="45">‘ Tis yet in vain , I own , to keep a pother</l>

     <l n="57">At such a feast , old vinegar to spare ,</l>

    <head>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE .</head>
    <head>EPISTLE I . TO LORD BOLINGBROKE .</head>
     <l n="1">St. John , whose love indulged my labours past ,</l>
     <l n="2">Matures my present , and shall bound my last !</l>
     <l n="3">Why will you break the Sabbath of my days ?</l>
     <l n="4">Now sick alike of envy and of praise .</l>
     <l n="5">Public too long , ah let me hide my age !</l>
     <l n="6">See , modest Cibber now has left the stage :</l>
     <l n="7">Our generals now , retired to their estates ,</l>
     <l n="8">Hang their old trophies o'er the garden gates ,</l>
     <l n="9">In life 's cool evening satiate of applause ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor fond of bleeding , even in Brunswick 's cause .</l>
     <l n="11">A voice there is , that whispers in my ear ,</l>
     <l n="12">( ‘ Tis Reason 's voice , which sometimes one can hear )</l>
     <l n="13">“ Friend Pope , be prudent , let your muse take breath ,</l>
     <l n="14">And never gallop Pegasus to death ;</l>
     <l n="15">Lest stiff and stately , void of fire or force ,</l>
     <l n="16">You limp , like Blackmore , on a lord mayor 's horse . ”</l>
     <l n="17">Farewell then verse , and love , and every toy ,</l>
     <l n="18">The rhymes and rattles of the man or boy ;</l>
     <l n="19">What right , what true , what fit we justly call ,</l>
     <l n="20">Let this be all my care — for this is all .</l>
     <l n="21">To lay this harvest up , and hoard with haste</l>
     <l n="22">What every day will want , and most , the last .</l>
     <l n="23">But ask not , to what doctors I apply ?</l>
     <l n="24">Sworn to no master , of no sect am I :</l>
     <l n="25">As drives the storm , at any door I knock :</l>
     <l n="26">And house with Montaigne now , or now with Locke .</l>
     <l n="27">Sometimes a patriot , active in debate ,</l>
     <l n="28">Mix with the world , and battle for the State ,</l>
     <l n="29">Free as young Lyttelton , her cause pursue ,</l>
     <l n="30">Still true to virtue , and as warm as true :</l>
     <l n="31">Sometimes with Aristippus , or St. Paul ,</l>
     <l n="32">Indulge my candour , and grow all to all ;</l>
     <l n="33">Back to my native moderation slide ,</l>
     <l n="34">And win my way by yielding to the tide .</l>
     <l n="35">Long , as to him who works for debt , the day ,</l>
     <l n="36">Long as the night to her whose love 's away ,</l>
     <l n="37">Long as the year 's dull circle seems to run ,</l>
     <l n="38">When the brisk minor pants for twenty-one :</l>
     <l n="39">So slow th ’ unprofitable moments roll ,</l>
     <l n="40">That lock up all the functions of my soul ;</l>
     <l n="41">That keep me from myself ; and still delay</l>
     <l n="42">Life 's instant business to a future day :</l>
     <l n="43">That task , which as we follow , or despise ,</l>
     <l n="44">The eldest is a fool , the youngest wise ;</l>
     <l n="45">Which done , the poorest can no wants endure ;</l>
     <l n="46">And which not done , the richest must be poor .</l>
     <l n="47">Late as it is , I put myself to school ,</l>
     <l n="48">And feel some comfort , not to be a fool .</l>
     <l n="49">Weak though I am of limb , and short of sight ,</l>
     <l n="50">Far from a lynx , and not a giant quite ;</l>
     <l n="51">I 'll do what Mead and Cheselden advise ,</l>
     <l n="52">To keep these limbs , and to preserve these eyes .</l>
     <l n="53">Not to go back , is somewhat to advance ,</l>
     <l n="54">And men must walk at least before they dance .</l>
     <l n="55">Say , does thy blood rebel , thy bosom move</l>
     <l n="56">With wretched avarice , or as wretched love ?</l>
     <l n="57">Know , there are words and spells , which can control</l>
     <l n="58">Between the fits this fever of the soul :</l>
     <l n="59">Know , there are rhymes , which fresh and fresh applied</l>
     <l n="60">Will cure the arrant'st puppy of his pride .</l>
     <l n="61">Be furious , envious , slothful , mad , or drunk ,</l>
     <l n="62">Slave to a wife , or vassal to a punk ,</l>
     <l n="63">A Switz , a High Dutch , or a Low Dutch bear ;</l>
     <l n="64">All that we ask is but a patient ear .</l>
     <l n="65">‘ Tis the first virtue , vices to abhor ;</l>
     <l n="66">And the first wisdom , to be fool no more .</l>
     <l n="67">But to the world no bugbear is so great ,</l>
     <l n="68">As want of figure , and a small estate .</l>
     <l n="69">To either India see the merchant fly ,</l>
     <l n="70">Scared at the spectre of pale poverty !</l>
     <l n="71">See him , with pains of body , pangs of soul ,</l>
     <l n="72">Burn through the Tropic , freeze beneath the pole !</l>
     <l n="73">Wilt thou do nothing for a nobler end ,</l>
     <l n="74">Nothing , to make philosophy thy friend ?</l>
     <l n="75">To stop thy foolish views , thy long desires ,</l>
     <l n="76">And ease thy heart of all that it admires ?</l>
     <l n="77">Here , wisdom calls : “ Seek virtue first , be bold !</l>
     <l n="78">As gold to silver , virtue is to gold . ”</l>
     <l n="79">There , London 's voice : “ Get money , money still !</l>
     <l n="80">And then let virtue follow , if she will . ”</l>
     <l n="81">This , this the saving doctrine , preached to all ,</l>
     <l n="82">From low St. James 's up to high St. Paul ;</l>
     <l n="83">From him whose quills stand quivered at his ear ,</l>
     <l n="84">To him who notches sticks at Westminster .</l>
     <l n="85">Barnard in spirit , sense , and truth abounds ;</l>
     <l n="86">“ Pray then , what wants he ? ” fourscore thousand pounds ;</l>
     <l n="87">A pension , or such harness for a slave</l>
     <l n="88">As Bug now has , and Dorimant would have .</l>
     <l n="89">Barnard , thou art a Cit , with all thy worth ;</l>
     <l n="90">But Bug and D * l , their honours , and so forth .</l>
     <l n="91">Yet every child another song will sing :</l>
     <l n="92">“ Virtue , brave boys ! ‘ tis virtue makes a king . ”</l>
     <l n="93">True , conscious honour is to feel no sin ,</l>
     <l n="94">He 's armed without that 's innocent within ;</l>
     <l n="95">Be this thy screen , and this thy wall of brass ;</l>
     <l n="96">Compared to this , a minister 's an ass .</l>
     <l n="97">And say , to which shall our applause belong ,</l>
     <l n="98">This new Court jargon , or the good old song ?</l>
     <l n="99">The modern language of corrupted peers ,</l>
     <l n="100">Or what was spoke at Cressy and Poitiers ?</l>
     <l n="101">Who counsels best ? who whispers , “ Be but great ,</l>
     <l n="102">With praise or infamy leave that to fate ;</l>
     <l n="103">Get place and wealth , if possible , with grace ;</l>
     <l n="104">If not , by any means get wealth and place — ”</l>
     <l n="105">For what ? to have a box where eunuchs sing ,</l>
     <l n="106">And foremost in the circle eye a king .</l>
     <l n="107">Or he , who bids thee face with steady view }</l>
     <l n="108">Proud fortune , and look shallow greatness through : }</l>
     <l n="109">And , while he bids thee , sets th ’ example too ? }</l>
     <l n="110">If such a doctrine , in St. James 's air ,</l>
     <l n="111">Should chance to make the well-dressed rabble stare ;</l>
     <l n="112">If honest S * z take scandal at a spark ,</l>
     <l n="113">That less admires the palace than the park :</l>
     <l n="114">Faith I shall give the answer Reynard gave :</l>
     <l n="115">“ I cannot like , dread sir , your royal cave :</l>
     <l n="116">Because I see , by all the tracks about ,</l>
     <l n="117">Full many a beast goes in , but none come out . ”</l>
     <l n="118">Adieu to virtue , if you 're once a slave :</l>
     <l n="119">Send her to Court , you send her to her grave .</l>
     <l n="120">Well , if a king 's a lion , at the least ,</l>
     <l n="121">The people are a many-headed beast :</l>
     <l n="122">Can they direct what measures to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="123">Who know themselves so little what to do ?</l>
     <l n="124">Alike in nothing but one lust of gold ,</l>
     <l n="125">Just half the land would buy , and half be sold :</l>
     <l n="126">Their country 's wealth our mightier misers drain ,</l>
     <l n="127">Or cross , to plunder provinces , the main ;</l>
     <l n="128">The rest , some farm the poor-box , some the pews ;</l>
     <l n="129">Some keep assemblies , and would keep the stews ;</l>
     <l n="130">Some with fat bucks on childless dotards fawn ;</l>
     <l n="131">Some win rich widows by their chine and brawn ;</l>
     <l n="132">While with the silent growth of ten per cent .</l>
     <l n="133">In dirt and darkness , hundreds stink content .</l>
     <l n="134">Of all these ways , if each pursues his own ,</l>
     <l n="135">Satire be kind , and let the wretch alone :</l>
     <l n="136">But show me one who has it in his power</l>
     <l n="137">To act consistent with himself an hour .</l>
     <l n="138">Sir Job sailed forth , the evening bright and still ,</l>

     <l n="165">But when no prelate 's lawn with hair-shirt lined ,</l>
     <l n="166">Is half so incoherent as my mind ,</l>
     <l n="167">When ( each opinion with the next at strife ,</l>
     <l n="168">One ebb and flow of follies all my life )</l>
     <l n="169">I plant , root up ; I build , and then confound ;</l>
     <l n="170">Turn round to square , and square again to round ;</l>
     <l n="171">You never change one muscle of your face ,</l>
     <l n="172">You think this madness but a common case ,</l>
     <l n="173">Nor once to Chancery , nor to Hale apply ;</l>
     <l n="174">Yet hang your lip , to see a seam awry !</l>
     <l n="175">Careless how ill I with myself agree ,</l>
     <l n="176">Kind to my dress , my figure , not to me .</l>
     <l n="177">Is this my guide , philosopher , and Friend ?</l>
     <l n="178">This , he who loves me , and who ought to mend ?</l>
     <l n="179">Who ought to make me ( what he can , or none ) ,</l>
     <l n="180">That man divine whom wisdom calls her own ;</l>
     <l n="181">Great without title , without fortune blessed ;</l>
     <l n="182">Rich even when plundered , honoured while oppressed ;</l>
     <l n="183">Loved without youth , and followed without power ;</l>
     <l n="184">At home , though exiled ; free , though in the Tower ;</l>
     <l n="185">In short , that reasoning , high , immortal thing ,</l>
     <l n="186">Just less than Jove , and much above a king ,</l>
     <l n="187">Nay , half in heaven — except ( what 's mighty odd )</l>
     <l n="188">A fit of vapours clouds this demi-god .</l>

   <p>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF HORACE .</p>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>The Reflections of Horace , and the Judgments past in his Epistle to Augustus , seemed so seasonable to the present Times , that I could not help applying them to the use of my own Country . The Author thought them considerable enough to address them to his Prince ; whom he paints with all the great and good qualities of a Monarch , upon whom the Romans depended for the Increase of an Absolute Empire . But to make the Poem entirely English , I was willing to add one or two of those which contribute to the Happiness of a Free People , and are more consistent with the Welfare of our Neighbours .</p>
   <p>This Epistle will show the learned World to have fallen into Two mistakes : one , that Augustus was a Patron of Poets in general ; whereas he not only prohibited all but the Best Writers to name him , but recommended that Care even to the Civil Magistrate : Admonebat Praetores , ne paterentur Nomen suum obsolefieri , etc . The other , that this Piece was only a general Discourse of Poetry ; whereas it was an Apology for the Poets , in order to render Augustus more their Patron . Horace here pleads the Cause of his Contemporaries , first against the Taste of the Town , whose humour it was to magnify the Authors of the preceding Age ; secondly against the Court and Nobility , who encouraged only the Writers for the Theatre ; and lastly against the Emperor himself , who had conceived them of little Use to the Government . He shows ( by a View of the Progress of Learning , and the Change of Taste among the Romans ) that the Introduction of the Polite Arts of Greece had given the Writers of his Time great advantages over their Predecessors ; that their Morals were much improved , and the Licence of those ancient Poets restrained : that Satire and Comedy were become more just and useful ; that , whatever extravagances were left on the Stage , were owing to the Ill Taste of the Nobility ; that Poets , under due Regulations , were in many respects useful to the State , and concludes , that it was upon them the Emperor himself must depend for his Fame with Posterity .</p>
   <p>We may farther learn from this Epistle , that Horace made his Court to this great Prince by writing with a decent Freedom toward him , with a just Contempt of his low Flatterers , and with a manly Regard to his own Character . P .</p>

    <head>EPISTLE I . TO AUGUSTUS .</head>
     <l n="1">While you , great patron of mankind ! sustain</l>
     <l n="2">The balanced world , and open all the main ;</l>
     <l n="3">Your country , chief , in arms abroad defend ,</l>
     <l n="4">At home , with morals , arts , and laws amend ;</l>
     <l n="5">How shall the muse from such a monarch , steal</l>
     <l n="6">An hour , and not defraud the public weal ?</l>
     <l n="7">Edward and Henry , now the boast of fame ,</l>
     <l n="8">And virtuous Alfred , a more sacred name ,</l>
     <l n="9">After a life of generous toils endured ,</l>
     <l n="10">The Gaul subdued , or property secured ,</l>
     <l n="11">Ambition humbled , mighty cities stormed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Our laws established , and the world reformed ;</l>
     <l n="13">Closed their long glories with a sigh , to find</l>
     <l n="14">Th ’ unwilling gratitude of base mankind !</l>
     <l n="15">All human virtue , to its latest breath ,</l>
     <l n="16">Finds envy never conquered but by death .</l>
     <l n="17">The great Alcides , every labour past ,</l>
     <l n="18">Had still this monster to subdue at last .</l>
     <l n="19">Sure fate of all , beneath whose rising ray</l>
     <l n="20">Each star of meaner merit fades away !</l>
     <l n="21">Oppressed we feel the beam directly beat ,</l>
     <l n="22">Those suns of glory please not till they set .</l>
     <l n="23">To thee , the world its present homage pays ,</l>
     <l n="24">The harvest early , but mature the praise :</l>
     <l n="25">Great friend of liberty ! in kings a name</l>
     <l n="26">Above all Greek , above all Roman fame :</l>
     <l n="27">Whose word is truth , as sacred and revered ,</l>
     <l n="28">As heaven 's own oracles from altars heard .</l>
     <l n="29">Wonder of kings ! like whom , to mortal eyes</l>
     <l n="30">None e'er has risen , and none e'er shall rise .</l>
     <l n="31">Just in one instance be it yet confest</l>
     <l n="32">Your people , sir , are partial in the rest :</l>
     <l n="33">Foes to all living worth except your own ,</l>
     <l n="34">And advocates for folly dead and gone .</l>
     <l n="35">Authors , like coins , grow dear as they grow old ;</l>
     <l n="36">It is the rust we value , not the gold .</l>
     <l n="37">Chaucer 's worst ribaldry is learned by rote ,</l>
     <l n="38">And beastly Skelton heads of houses quote :</l>
     <l n="39">One likes no language but the Faery Queen ;</l>
     <l n="40">A Scot will fight for Christ 's Kirk o ’ the Green :</l>
     <l n="41">And each true Briton is to Ben so civil ,</l>
     <l n="42">He swears the Muses met him at the devil .</l>
     <l n="43">Though justly Greece her eldest sons admires ,</l>
     <l n="44">Why should not we be wiser than our sires ?</l>
     <l n="45">In every public virtue we excel ;</l>
     <l n="46">We build , we paint , we sing , we dance as well ,</l>
     <l n="47">And learned Athens to our art must stoop ,</l>
     <l n="48">Could she behold us tumbling through a hoop .</l>
     <l n="49">If time improve our wit as well as wine ,</l>
     <l n="50">Say at what age a poet grows divine ?</l>
     <l n="51">Shall we or shall we not account him so ,</l>
     <l n="52">Who died , perhaps , a hundred years ago ?</l>
     <l n="53">End all dispute ; and fix the year precise</l>
     <l n="54">When British bards begin t ’ immortalise ?</l>
     <l n="55">“ Who lasts a century can have no flaw ,</l>
     <l n="56">I hold that wit a classic , good in law . ”</l>
     <l n="57">Suppose he wants a year , will you compound ;</l>
     <l n="58">And shall we deem him ancient , right and sound ,</l>
     <l n="59">Or damn to all eternity at once ,</l>
     <l n="60">At ninety-nine , a modern and a dunce ?</l>
     <l n="61">“ We shall not quarrel for a year or two ;</l>
     <l n="62">By courtesy of England , he may do . ”</l>
     <l n="63">Then by the rule that made the horse-tail bear ,</l>
     <l n="64">I pluck out year by year , as hair by hair ,</l>
     <l n="65">And melt down ancients like a heap of snow :</l>
     <l n="66">While you to measure merits , look in Stowe ,</l>
     <l n="67">And estimating authors by the year</l>
     <l n="68">Bestow a garland only on a bier .</l>
     <l n="69">Shakespeare ( whom you and every play-house bill</l>
     <l n="70">Style the divine , the matchless , what you will )</l>
     <l n="71">For gain , not glory , winged his roving flight ,</l>
     <l n="72">And grew immortal in his own despite .</l>
     <l n="73">Ben , old and poor , as little seemed to heed</l>
     <l n="74">The life to come , in every poet 's creed .</l>
     <l n="75">Who now reads Cowley ? if he pleases yet ,</l>
     <l n="76">His moral pleases , not his pointed wit ;</l>
     <l n="77">Forget his epic , nay Pindaric art ;</l>
     <l n="78">But still I love the language of his heart .</l>
     <l n="79">“ Yet surely , surely , these were famous men !</l>
     <l n="80">What boy but hears the sayings of old Ben ?</l>
     <l n="81">In all debates where Critics bears a part ,</l>
     <l n="82">Not one but nods , and talks of Jonson 's art ,</l>
     <l n="83">Of Shakespeare 's nature , and of Cowley 's wit ;</l>
     <l n="84">How Beaumont 's judgment checked what Fletcher writ ;</l>
     <l n="85">How Shadwell hasty , Wycherley was slow ;</l>
     <l n="86">But for the passions , Southern sure and Rowe .</l>
     <l n="87">These , only these , support the crowded stage ,</l>
     <l n="88">From eldest Heywood down to Cibber 's age . ”</l>
     <l n="89">All this may be ; the people 's voice is odd ,</l>
     <l n="90">It is , and it is not , the voice of God .</l>
     <l n="91">To Gammer Gurton if it give the bays ,</l>
     <l n="92">And yet deny the careless husband praise .</l>
     <l n="93">Or say our fathers never broke a rule ;</l>
     <l n="94">Why then , I say , the public is a fool .</l>
     <l n="95">But let them own , that greater faults than we</l>
     <l n="96">They had , and greater virtues , I 'll agree .</l>
     <l n="97">Spenser himself affects the obsolete ,</l>
     <l n="98">And Sidney 's verse halts ill on Roman feet :</l>
     <l n="99">Milton 's strong pinion now not Heaven can bound ,</l>
     <l n="100">Now serpent-like , in prose he sweeps the ground ,</l>
     <l n="101">In quibbles angel and archangel join ,</l>
     <l n="102">And God the Father turns a school divine .</l>
     <l n="103">Not that I 'd lop the beauties from his book ,</l>
     <l n="104">Like slashing Bentley with his desperate hook ,</l>
     <l n="105">Or damn all Shakespeare , like the affected fool</l>
     <l n="106">At court , who hates whate'er he read at school .</l>
     <l n="107">But for the wits of either Charles 's days ,</l>
     <l n="108">The mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease ;</l>
     <l n="109">Sprat , Carew , Sedley , and a hundred more ,</l>
     <l n="110">( Like twinkling stars the miscellanies o'er )</l>
     <l n="111">One simile , that solitary shines</l>
     <l n="112">In the dry desert of a thousand lines ,</l>
     <l n="113">Or lengthened thought that gleams through many a page ,</l>
     <l n="114">Has sanctified whole poems for an age .</l>
     <l n="115">I lose my patience , and I own it too ,</l>
     <l n="116">When works are censured , not as bad but new ;</l>
     <l n="117">While if our elders break all reason 's laws ,</l>
     <l n="118">These fools demand not pardon , but applause .</l>
     <l n="119">On Avon 's bank , where flowers eternal blow ,</l>
     <l n="120">If I but ask , if any weed can grow ;</l>
     <l n="121">One tragic sentence if I dare deride</l>
     <l n="122">Which Betterton 's grave action dignified ,</l>
     <l n="123">Or well-mouthed Booth with emphasis proclaims ,</l>
     <l n="124">( Though but , perhaps , a muster-roll of names )</l>
     <l n="125">How will our fathers rise up in a rage ,</l>
     <l n="126">And swear , all shame is lost in George 's age !</l>
     <l n="127">You 'd think no fools disgraced the former reign ,</l>
     <l n="128">Did not some grave examples yet remain ,</l>
     <l n="129">Who scorn a lad should teach his father skill ,</l>
     <l n="130">And , having once been wrong , will be so still .</l>
     <l n="131">He , who to seem more deep than you or I ,</l>
     <l n="132">Extols old bards , or Merlin 's Prophecy ,</l>
     <l n="133">Mistake him not ; he envies , not admires ,</l>
     <l n="134">And to debase the sons , exalts the sires .</l>
     <l n="135">Had ancient times conspired to disallow</l>
     <l n="136">What then was new , what had been ancient now ?</l>
     <l n="137">Or what remained , so worthy to be read</l>
     <l n="138">By learned critics , of the mighty dead ?</l>
     <l n="139">In days of ease , when now the weary sword</l>
     <l n="140">Was sheathed , and luxury with Charles restored ;</l>
     <l n="141">In every taste of foreign courts improved ,</l>
     <l n="142">“ All , by the king 's example , lived and loved . ”</l>
     <l n="143">Then peers grew proud in horsemanship t ’ excel ,</l>
     <l n="144">Newmarket 's glory rose , as Britain 's fell ;</l>
     <l n="145">The soldier breathed the gallantries of France ,</l>
     <l n="146">And every flowery courtier wrote romance .</l>
     <l n="147">Then marble , softened into life , grew warm :</l>
     <l n="148">And yielding metal flowed to human form :</l>
     <l n="149">Lely on animated canvas stole</l>
     <l n="150">The sleepy eye , that spoke the melting soul .</l>
     <l n="151">No wonder then , when all was love and sport ,</l>
     <l n="152">The willing Muses were debauched at court :</l>
     <l n="153">On each enervate string they taught the note</l>
     <l n="154">To pant , or tremble through an eunuch 's throat .</l>
     <l n="155">But Britain , changeful as a child at play ,</l>
     <l n="156">Now calls in princes , and now turns away .</l>
     <l n="157">Now Whig , now Tory , what we loved we hate ;</l>
     <l n="158">Now all for pleasure , now for Church and State ;</l>
     <l n="159">Now for prerogative , and now for laws ;</l>
     <l n="160">Effects unhappy from a noble cause .</l>
     <l n="161">Time was , a sober Englishman would knock</l>
     <l n="162">His servants up , and rise by five o'clock ,</l>
     <l n="163">Instruct his family in every rule ,</l>
     <l n="164">And send his wife to church , his son to school .</l>
     <l n="165">To worship like his fathers , was his care ;</l>
     <l n="166">To teach their frugal virtues to his heir ;</l>
     <l n="167">To prove , that luxury could never hold ;</l>
     <l n="168">And place , on good security , his gold .</l>
     <l n="169">Now times are changed , and one poetic itch</l>
     <l n="170">Has seized the court and city , poor and rich :</l>
     <l n="171">Sons , sires , and grandsires , all will wear the bays ,</l>
     <l n="172">Our wives read Milton , and our daughters plays ,</l>
     <l n="173">To theatres , and to rehearsals throng ,</l>
     <l n="174">And all our grace at table is a song .</l>
     <l n="175">I , who so oft renounce the Muses , lie ,</l>
     <l n="176">Not —— ‘ s self e'er tells more fibs than I ;</l>
     <l n="177">When sick of Muse , our follies we deplore ,</l>
     <l n="178">And promise our best friends to rhyme no more ;</l>
     <l n="179">We wake next morning in a raging fit ,</l>
     <l n="180">And call for pen and ink to show our wit .</l>
     <l n="181">He served a ‘ prenticeship , who sets up shop ;</l>
     <l n="182">Ward tried on puppies , and the poor , his drop ;</l>
     <l n="183">Even Radcliff 's doctors travel first to France ,</l>
     <l n="184">Nor dare to practise till they 've learned to dance .</l>
     <l n="185">Who builds a bridge that never drove a pile ?</l>
     <l n="186">( Should Ripley venture , all the world would smile )</l>
     <l n="187">But those who cannot write , and those who can ,</l>
     <l n="188">All rhyme , and scrawl , and scribble , to a man .</l>
     <l n="189">Yet , sir , reflect , the mischief is not great ;</l>
     <l n="190">These madmen never hurt the Church or State ;</l>
     <l n="191">Sometimes the folly benefits mankind ;</l>
     <l n="192">And rarely av'rice taints the tuneful mind .</l>
     <l n="193">Allow him but his plaything of a pen ,</l>
     <l n="194">He ne'er rebels , or plots , like other men :</l>
     <l n="195">Flight of cashiers , or mobs , he 'll never mind ;</l>
     <l n="196">And knows no losses while the Muse is kind .</l>
     <l n="197">To cheat a friend , or ward , he leaves to Peter ;</l>
     <l n="198">The good man heaps up nothing but mere metre ,</l>
     <l n="199">Enjoys his garden and his book in quiet ;</l>
     <l n="200">And then — a perfect hermit in his diet .</l>
     <l n="201">Of little use the man you may suppose ,</l>
     <l n="202">Who says in verse what others say in prose ;</l>
     <l n="203">Yet let me show , a poet 's of some weight ,</l>
     <l n="204">And ( though no soldier ) useful to the State .</l>
     <l n="205">What will a child learn sooner than a song ?</l>
     <l n="206">What better teach a foreigner the tongue ?</l>
     <l n="207">What 's long or short , each accent where to place ,</l>
     <l n="208">And speak in public with some sort of grace ?</l>
     <l n="209">I scarce can think him such a worthless thing ,</l>
     <l n="210">Unless he praise some monster of a king ;</l>
     <l n="211">Or virtue , or religion turn to sport ,</l>
     <l n="212">To please a lewd or unbelieving court .</l>
     <l n="213">Unhappy Dryden !— In all Charles 's days ,</l>
     <l n="214">Roscommon only boasts unspotted bays ;</l>
     <l n="215">And in our own ( excuse some courtly stains )</l>
     <l n="216">No whiter page than Addison remains .</l>
     <l n="217">He , from the taste obscene reclaims our youth ,</l>
     <l n="218">And sets the passions on the side of truth ,</l>
     <l n="219">Forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art ,</l>
     <l n="220">And pours each human virtue in the heart .</l>
     <l n="221">Let Ireland tell , how wit upheld her cause ,</l>
     <l n="222">Her trade supported , and supplied her laws ;</l>
     <l n="223">And leave on Swift this grateful verse engraved :</l>
     <l n="224">‘ The rights a court attacked , a poet saved . ’</l>
     <l n="225">Behold the hand that wrought a nation 's cure ,</l>
     <l n="226">Stretched to relieve the idiot and the poor ,</l>
     <l n="227">Proud vice to brand , or injured worth adorn ,</l>
     <l n="228">And stretch the ray to ages yet unborn .</l>
     <l n="229">Not but there are , who merit other palms ;</l>
     <l n="230">Hopkins and Sternhold glad the heart with psalms :</l>
     <l n="231">The boys and girls whom charity maintains ,</l>
     <l n="232">Implore your help in these pathetic strains :</l>
     <l n="233">How could devotion touch the country pews ,</l>
     <l n="234">Unless the gods bestowed a proper Muse ?</l>
     <l n="235">Verse cheers their leisure , verse assists their work ,</l>
     <l n="236">Verse prays for peace , or sings down Pope and Turk .</l>
     <l n="237">The silenced preacher yields to potent strain ,</l>
     <l n="238">And feels that grace his prayer besought in vain ;</l>
     <l n="239">The blessing thrills through all the lab'ring throng ,</l>
     <l n="240">And Heaven is won by violence of song .</l>
     <l n="241">Our rural ancestors , with little blest ,</l>
     <l n="242">Patient of labour when the end was rest ,</l>
     <l n="243">Indulged the day that housed their annual grain ,</l>
     <l n="244">With feasts , and off'rings , and a thankful strain :</l>
     <l n="245">The joy their wives , their sons , and servants share ,</l>
     <l n="246">Ease of their toil , and partners of their care :</l>
     <l n="247">The laugh , the jest , attendants on the bowl ,</l>
     <l n="248">Smoothed every brow , and opened every soul :</l>
     <l n="249">With growing years the pleasing licence grew ,</l>
     <l n="250">And taunts alternate innocently flew .</l>
     <l n="251">But times corrupt , and Nature , ill-inclined ,</l>
     <l n="252">Produced the point that left a sting behind ;</l>
     <l n="253">Till friend with friend , and families at strife ,</l>
     <l n="254">Triumphant malice raged through private life .</l>
     <l n="255">Who felt the wrong , or feared it , took th ’ alarm ,</l>
     <l n="256">Appealed to law , and justice lent her arm .</l>
     <l n="257">At length , by wholesome dread of statutes bound ,</l>
     <l n="258">The poets learned to please , and not to wound :</l>
     <l n="259">Most warped to flatt'ry ' s side ; but some more nice ,</l>
     <l n="260">Preserved the freedom , and forebore the vice .</l>
     <l n="261">Hence satire rose , that just the medium hit ,</l>
     <l n="262">And heals with morals what it hurts with wit .</l>
     <l n="263">We conquered France , but felt our captive 's charms ;</l>
     <l n="264">Her arts victorious triumphed o'er our arms ;</l>
     <l n="265">Britain to soft refinements less a foe ,</l>
     <l n="266">Wit grew polite , and numbers learned to flow .</l>
     <l n="267">Waller was smooth ; but Dryden taught to join }</l>
     <l n="268">The varying verse , the full-resounding line , }</l>
     <l n="269">The long majestic march , and energy divine . }</l>
     <l n="270">Though still some traces of our rustic vein</l>
     <l n="271">And splay-foot verse , remained , and will remain .</l>
     <l n="272">Late , very late , correctness grew our care ,</l>
     <l n="273">When the tired nation breathed from civil war .</l>
     <l n="274">Exact Racine , and Corneille 's noble fire ,</l>
     <l n="275">Showed us that France had something to admire .</l>
     <l n="276">Not but the tragic spirit was our own ,</l>
     <l n="277">And full in Shakespeare , fair in Otway shone :</l>
     <l n="278">But Otway failed to polish or refine ,</l>
     <l n="279">And fluent Shakespeare scarce effaced a line .</l>
     <l n="280">E'en copious Dryden wanted , or forgot</l>
     <l n="281">The last and greatest art , the art to blot .</l>
     <l n="282">Some doubt , if equal pains , or equal fire</l>
     <l n="283">The humbler Muse of comedy require .</l>
     <l n="284">But in known images of life , I guess</l>
     <l n="285">The labour greater , as th ’ indulgence less .</l>
     <l n="286">Observe how seldom even the best succeed :</l>
     <l n="287">Tell me if Congreve 's fools are fools indeed ?</l>
     <l n="288">What pert , low dialogue has Farquhar writ !</l>
     <l n="289">How Van wants grace , who never wanted wit !</l>
     <l n="290">The stage how loosely does Astraea tread ,</l>
     <l n="291">Who fairly puts all characters to bed !</l>
     <l n="292">And idle Cibber , how he breaks the laws ,</l>
     <l n="293">To make poor Pinky eat with vast applause !</l>
     <l n="294">But fill their purse , our poet 's work is done ,</l>
     <l n="295">Alike to them , by pathos or by pun .</l>
     <l n="296">O you ! whom vanity 's light bark conveys</l>
     <l n="297">On fame 's mad voyage by the wind of praise ,</l>
     <l n="298">With what a shifting gale your course you ply ,</l>
     <l n="299">For ever sunk too low , or borne too high !</l>
     <l n="300">Who pants for glory finds but short repose ,</l>
     <l n="301">A breath revives him , or a breath o'erthrows .</l>
     <l n="302">Farewell the stage ! if just as thrives the play ,</l>
     <l n="303">The silly bard grows fat , or falls away .</l>
     <l n="304">There still remains , to mortify a wit ,</l>
     <l n="305">The many-headed monster of the pit ;</l>
     <l n="306">A senseless , worthless , and unhonoured crowd ;</l>
     <l n="307">Who , to disturb their betters mighty proud ,</l>
     <l n="308">Clatt'ring their sticks before ten lines are spoke ,</l>
     <l n="309">Call for the farce , the bear , or the black-joke .</l>
     <l n="310">What dear delight to Britons farce affords !</l>
     <l n="311">Ever the taste of mobs , but now of lords ;</l>
     <l n="312">( Taste , that eternal wanderer , which flies</l>
     <l n="313">From heads to ears , and now from ears to eyes ) .</l>
     <l n="314">The play stands still ; damn action and discourse ,</l>
     <l n="315">Back fly the scenes , and enter foot and horse ;</l>
     <l n="316">Pageants on pageants , in long order drawn ,</l>
     <l n="317">Peers , Heralds , Bishops , ermine , gold , and lawn ;</l>
     <l n="318">The champion too ! and , to complete the jest ,</l>
     <l n="319">Old Edward 's armour beams on Cibber 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="320">With laughter sure Democritus had died ,</l>
     <l n="321">Had he beheld an audience gape so wide .</l>
     <l n="322">Let bear or elephant be e'er so white ,</l>
     <l n="323">The people , sure , the people are the sight !</l>
     <l n="324">Ah luckless poet ! stretch thy lungs and roar ,</l>
     <l n="325">That bear or elephant shall heed thee more ;</l>
     <l n="326">While all its throats the gallery extends ,</l>
     <l n="327">And all the thunder of the pit ascends !</l>
     <l n="328">Loud as the wolves , on Orcas ’ stormy steep ,</l>
     <l n="329">Howl to the roarings of the Northern deep ,</l>
     <l n="330">Such is the shout , the long-applauding note ,</l>
     <l n="331">At Quin 's high plume , or Oldfield 's petticoat ;</l>
     <l n="332">Or when from court a birthday suit bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="333">Sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load .</l>
     <l n="334">Booth enters — hark ! the universal peal !</l>
     <l n="335">“ But has he spoken ? ” Not a syllable .</l>
     <l n="336">What shook the stage , and made the people stare ?</l>
     <l n="337">Cato 's long wig , flowered gown , and lacquered chair .</l>
     <l n="338">Yet lest you think I rally more than teach ,</l>
     <l n="339">Or praise malignly arts I cannot reach ,</l>
     <l n="340">Let me for once presume t ’ instruct the times ,</l>
     <l n="341">To know the poet from the man of rhymes :</l>
     <l n="342">‘ Tis he , who gives my breast a thousand pains ,</l>
     <l n="343">Can make me feel each passion that he feigns ;</l>
     <l n="344">Enrage , compose , with more than magic art ,</l>
     <l n="345">With pity , and with terror , tear my heart ;</l>
     <l n="346">And snatch me , o'er the earth , or through the air ,</l>
     <l n="347">To Thebes , to Athens , when he will , and where .</l>
     <l n="348">But not this part of the poetic state</l>
     <l n="349">Alone , deserves the favour of the great ;</l>
     <l n="350">Think of those authors , sir , who would rely</l>
     <l n="351">More on a reader 's sense , than gazer 's eye .</l>
     <l n="352">Or who shall wander where the Muses sing ?</l>
     <l n="353">Who climb their mountain , or who taste their spring ?</l>
     <l n="354">How shall we fill a library with wit ,</l>
     <l n="355">When Merlin 's cave is half unfurnished yet ?</l>
     <l n="356">My liege ! why writers little claim your thought ,</l>
     <l n="357">I guess ; and , with their leave , will tell the fault :</l>
     <l n="358">We poets are ( upon a poet 's word )</l>
     <l n="359">Of all mankind , the creatures most absurd :</l>
     <l n="360">The season , when to come , and when to go ,</l>
     <l n="361">To sing , or cease to sing , we never know ;</l>
     <l n="362">And if we will recite nine hours in ten ,</l>
     <l n="363">You lose your patience , just like other men .</l>
     <l n="364">Then too we hurt ourselves , when to defend</l>
     <l n="365">A single verse , we quarrel with a friend ;</l>
     <l n="366">Repeat unasked ; lament , the wit 's too fine</l>
     <l n="367">For vulgar eyes , and point out every line .</l>
     <l n="368">But most , when straining with too weak a wing ,</l>
     <l n="369">We needs will write epistles to the King ;</l>
     <l n="370">And from the moment we oblige the town ,</l>
     <l n="371">Expect a place , or pension from the Crown ;</l>
     <l n="372">Or dubbed historians , by express command ,</l>
     <l n="373">T ’ enrol your triumphs o'er the seas and land ,</l>
     <l n="374">Be called to Court to plan some work divine ,</l>
     <l n="375">As once for Louis , Boileau and Racine .</l>
     <l n="376">Yet think , great sir ! ( so many virtues shown )</l>
     <l n="377">Ah think , what poet best may make them known ?</l>
     <l n="378">Or choose at least some minister of grace ,</l>
     <l n="379">Fit to bestow the laureate 's weighty place .</l>
     <l n="380">Charles , to late times to be transmitted fair ,</l>
     <l n="381">Assigned his figure to Bernini 's care ;</l>
     <l n="382">And great Nassau to Kneller 's hand decreed</l>
     <l n="383">To fix him graceful on the bounding steed ;</l>
     <l n="384">So well in paint and stone they judged of merit :</l>
     <l n="385">But kings in wit may want discerning spirit .</l>
     <l n="386">The hero William and the martyr Charles ,</l>
     <l n="387">One knighted Blackmore , and one pensioned Quarles ;</l>
     <l n="388">Which made old Ben , and surly Dennis swear ,</l>
     <l n="389">“ No Lord 's anointed , but a Russian bear . ”</l>
     <l n="390">Not with such majesty , such bold relief ,</l>
     <l n="391">The forms august , of king , or conquering chief ,</l>
     <l n="392">E'er swelled on marble ; as in verse have shined</l>
     <l n="393">( In polished verse ) the manners and the mind .</l>
     <l n="394">Oh ! could I mount on the Maeonian wing ,</l>
     <l n="395">Your arms , your actions , your repose to sing !</l>
     <l n="396">What seas you traversed , and what fields you fought !</l>
     <l n="397">Your country 's peace , how oft , how dearly bought !</l>
     <l n="398">How barb'rous rage subsided at your word ,</l>
     <l n="399">And nations wondered while they dropped the sword !</l>
     <l n="400">How , when you nodded , o'er the land and deep ,</l>
     <l n="401">Peace stole her wing , and wrapped the world in sleep ;</l>
     <l n="402">Till earth 's extremes your mediation own ,</l>
     <l n="403">And Asia 's tyrants tremble at your throne —</l>
     <l n="404">But verse , alas ! your majesty disdains ;</l>
     <l n="405">And I 'm not used to panegyric strains :</l>
     <l n="406">The zeal of fools offends at any time ,</l>
     <l n="407">But most of all , the zeal of fools in rhyme .</l>
     <l n="408">Besides , a fate attends on all I write ,</l>
     <l n="409">That when I aim at praise , they say I bite .</l>
     <l n="410">A vile encomium doubly ridicules :</l>
     <l n="411">There 's nothing blackens like the ink of fools .</l>
     <l n="412">If true , a woeful likeness ; and if lies ,</l>
     <l n="413">“ Praise undeserved is scandal in disguise : ”</l>
     <l n="414">Well may he blush , who gives it , or receives ;</l>
     <l n="415">And when I flatter , let my dirty leaves</l>

     <l n="2">Dear Colonel , Cobham 's and your country 's friend !</l>
     <l n="3">You love a verse , take such as I can send .</l>
     <l n="4">A Frenchman comes , presents you with his boy ,</l>
     <l n="5">Bows and begins — “ This lad , sir , is of Blois :</l>
     <l n="6">Observe his shape how clean ! his locks how curled !</l>
     <l n="7">My only son , I 'd have him see the world :</l>
     <l n="8">His French is pure ; his voice too — you shall hear .</l>
     <l n="9">Sir , he 's your slave for twenty pound a year .</l>
     <l n="10">Mere wax as yet , you fashion him with ease ,</l>
     <l n="11">Your barber , cook , upholsterer , what you please :</l>
     <l n="12">A perfect genius at an opera song —</l>
     <l n="13">To say too much might do my honour wrong .</l>
     <l n="14">Take him with all his virtues , on my word ;</l>
     <l n="15">His whole ambition was to serve a lord :</l>
     <l n="16">But , sir , to you , with what would I not part ?</l>
     <l n="17">Though faith , I fear ‘ twill break his mother 's heart .</l>
     <l n="18">Once ( and but once ) I caught him in a lie ,</l>
     <l n="19">And then , unwhipped , he had the grace to cry :</l>
     <l n="20">The fault he has I fairly shall reveal ,</l>
     <l n="21">( Could you o'erlook but that ) it is to steal . ”</l>
     <l n="22">If , after this , you took the graceless lad ,</l>
     <l n="23">Could you complain , my friend , he proved so bad ?</l>
     <l n="24">Faith , in such case , if you should prosecute ,</l>
     <l n="25">I think Sir Godfrey should decide the suit :</l>
     <l n="26">Who sent the thief that stole the cash away ,</l>
     <l n="27">And punished him that put it in his way .</l>
     <l n="28">Consider then , and judge me in this light ;</l>
     <l n="29">I told you when I went , I could not write ;</l>
     <l n="30">You said the same ; and are you discontent</l>
     <l n="31">With laws to which you gave your own assent ?</l>
     <l n="32">Nay worse , to ask for verse at such a time !</l>
     <l n="33">D'ye think me good for nothing but to rhyme ?</l>
     <l n="34">In Anna 's wars , a soldier poor and old</l>
     <l n="35">Had dearly earned a little purse of gold ;</l>
     <l n="36">Tired with a tedious march , one luckless night ,</l>
     <l n="37">He slept , poor dog ! and lost it to a doit .</l>
     <l n="38">This put the man in such a desperate mind , }</l>
     <l n="39">Between revenge , and grief , and hunger joined }</l>
     <l n="40">Against the foe , himself , and all mankind , }</l>
     <l n="41">He leaped the trenches , scaled a castle wall ,</l>
     <l n="42">Tore down a standard , took the fort and all .</l>
     <l n="43">“ Prodigious well , ” his great commander cried ,</l>
     <l n="44">Gave him much praise and some reward beside .</l>
     <l n="45">Next pleased his excellence a town to batter :</l>
     <l n="46">( Its name I know not , and it 's no great matter ) .</l>
     <l n="47">“ Go on , my friend , ” he cried , “ see yonder walls ,</l>
     <l n="48">Advance and conquer ! go where glory calls !</l>
     <l n="49">More honours , more rewards attend the brave . ”</l>
     <l n="50">Do n't you remember what reply he gave ?</l>
     <l n="51">“ D'ye think me , noble general , such a sot ?</l>
     <l n="52">Let him take castles who has ne'er a groat . ”</l>
     <l n="53">Bred up at home , full early I begun</l>
     <l n="54">To read in Greek the wrath of Peleus ’ son .</l>
     <l n="55">Besides , my father taught me from a lad ,</l>
     <l n="56">The better art to know the good from bad :</l>
     <l n="57">( And little sure imported to remove ,</l>
     <l n="58">To hunt for truth in Maudlin 's learned grove ) .</l>
     <l n="59">But knottier points we knew not half so well ,</l>
     <l n="60">Deprived us soon of our paternal cell ;</l>
     <l n="61">And certain laws , by sufferers thought unjust ,</l>
     <l n="62">Denied all posts of profit or of trust :</l>
     <l n="63">Hopes after hopes of pious Papists failed ,</l>
     <l n="64">While mighty William 's thundering arm prevailed ,</l>
     <l n="65">For right hereditary taxed and fined ,</l>
     <l n="66">He stuck to poverty with peace of mind ;</l>
     <l n="67">And me , the Muses helped to undergo it ;</l>
     <l n="68">Convict a Papist he , and I a poet .</l>
     <l n="69">But ( thanks to Homer ) since I live and thrive ,</l>
     <l n="70">Indebted to no prince or peer alive ,</l>
     <l n="71">Sure I should want the care of ten Monroes ,</l>
     <l n="72">If I would scribble rather than repose .</l>
     <l n="73">Years following years , steal something every day ,</l>
     <l n="74">At last they steal us from ourselves away ;</l>
     <l n="75">In one our frolics , one amusements end ,</l>
     <l n="76">In one a mistress drops , in one a friend :</l>
     <l n="77">This subtle thief of life , this paltry time ,</l>
     <l n="78">What will it leave me , if it snatch my rhyme ?</l>
     <l n="79">If every wheel of that unwearied mill ,</l>
     <l n="80">That turned ten thousand verses , now stands still ?</l>
     <l n="81">But after all , what would you have me do ?</l>
     <l n="82">When out of twenty I can please not two ;</l>
     <l n="83">When this heroics only deigns to praise ,</l>
     <l n="84">Sharp satire that , and that Pindaric lays ?</l>
     <l n="85">One likes the pheasant 's wing , and one the leg ;</l>
     <l n="86">The vulgar boil , the learned roast an egg ;</l>
     <l n="87">Hard task ! to hit the palate of such guests ,</l>
     <l n="88">When Oldfield loves what Dartineuf detests .</l>
     <l n="89">But grant I may relapse , for want of grace ,</l>
     <l n="90">Again to rhyme , can London be the place ?</l>
     <l n="91">Who there his Muse , or self , or soul attends ,</l>
     <l n="92">In crowds , and courts , law , business , feasts , and friends ?</l>
     <l n="93">My counsel sends to execute a deed ;</l>
     <l n="94">A poet begs me I will hear him read ;</l>
     <l n="95">‘ In Palace Yard at nine you 'll find me there — ’</l>
     <l n="96">‘ At ten for certain , sir , in Bloomsbury Square — ’</l>
     <l n="97">‘ Before the Lords at twelve my cause comes on — ’</l>
     <l n="98">‘ There 's a rehearsal , sir , exact at one .— ’</l>
     <l n="99">“ Oh , but a wit can study in the streets ,</l>
     <l n="100">And raise his mind above the mob he meets . ”</l>
     <l n="101">Not quite so well , however , as one ought ;</l>
     <l n="102">A hackney coach may chance to spoil a thought ;</l>
     <l n="103">And then a nodding beam or pig of lead ,</l>
     <l n="104">God knows , may hurt the very ablest head .</l>
     <l n="105">Have you not seen , at Guildhall 's narrow pass ,</l>
     <l n="106">Two aldermen dispute it with an ass ?</l>
     <l n="107">And peers give way , exalted as they are ,</l>
     <l n="108">Even to their own s-r-v-ance in a car ?</l>
     <l n="109">Go , lofty poet ! and in such a crowd ,</l>
     <l n="110">Sing thy sonorous verse — but not aloud .</l>
     <l n="111">Alas ! to grottoes and to groves we run ,</l>
     <l n="112">To ease and silence , every Muse 's son :</l>
     <l n="113">Blackmore himself , for any grand effort ,</l>
     <l n="114">Would drink and doze at Tooting or Earl 's Court .</l>
     <l n="115">How shall I rhyme in this eternal roar ?</l>
     <l n="116">How match the bards whom none e'er matched before ?</l>
     <l n="117">The man , who , stretched in Isis ’ calm retreat ,</l>
     <l n="118">To books and study gives seven years complete ,</l>
     <l n="119">See ! strewed with learned dust , his night-cap on ,</l>
     <l n="120">He walks , an object new beneath the sun !</l>
     <l n="121">The boys flock round him , and the people stare : }</l>
     <l n="122">So stiff , so mute ! some statue you would swear , }</l>
     <l n="123">Stepped from its pedestal to take the air ! }</l>
     <l n="124">And here , while town , and court , and city roars ,</l>
     <l n="125">With mobs , and duns , and soldiers at their doors ;</l>
     <l n="126">Shall I , in London , act this idle part ?</l>
     <l n="127">Composing songs for fools to get by heart ?</l>
     <l n="128">The Temple late two brother sergeants saw ,</l>
     <l n="129">Who deemed each other oracles of law ;</l>
     <l n="130">With equal talents these congenial souls ,</l>
     <l n="131">One lulled th ’ Exchequer , and one stunned the Rolls ;</l>
     <l n="132">Each had a gravity would make you split ,</l>
     <l n="133">And shook his head at Murray as a wit .</l>
     <l n="134">“ ‘ Twas , sir , your law ” — and “ Sir , your eloquence — ”</l>
     <l n="135">“ Yours , Cowper 's manner ” — and “ yours , Talbot 's sense . ”</l>
     <l n="136">Thus we dispose of all poetic merit ,</l>
     <l n="137">Yours Milton 's genius , and mine Homer 's spirit .</l>
     <l n="138">Call Tibbald Shakespeare , and he 'll swear the nine ,</l>
     <l n="139">Dear Cibber ! never matched one ode of thine .</l>
     <l n="140">Lord ! how we strut through Merlin 's cave , to see</l>
     <l n="141">No poets there , but Stephen , you , and me .</l>
     <l n="142">Walk with respect behind , while we at ease</l>
     <l n="143">Weave laurel crowns , and take what names we please .</l>
     <l n="144">“ My dear Tibullus ! ” if that will not do ,</l>
     <l n="145">“ Let me be Horace , and be Ovid you :</l>
     <l n="146">Or , I 'm content , allow me Dryden 's strains ,</l>
     <l n="147">And you shall rise up Otway for your pains . ”</l>
     <l n="148">Much do I suffer , much , to keep in peace</l>
     <l n="149">This jealous , waspish , wrong-head , rhyming race ;</l>
     <l n="150">And much must flatter , if the whim should bite</l>
     <l n="151">To court applause by printing what I write :</l>
     <l n="152">But let the fit pass o'er , I 'm wise enough ,</l>
     <l n="153">To stop my ears to their confounded stuff .</l>
     <l n="154">In vain bad rhymers all mankind reject ,</l>
     <l n="155">They treat themselves with most profound respect ;</l>
     <l n="156">‘ Tis to small purpose that you hold your tongue :</l>
     <l n="157">Each praised within , is happy all day long ;</l>
     <l n="158">But how severely with themselves proceed</l>
     <l n="159">The men , who write such verse as we can read ?</l>
     <l n="160">Their own strict judges , not a word they spare</l>
     <l n="161">That wants , or force , or light , or weight , or care ,</l>
     <l n="162">Howe'er unwillingly it quits its place ,</l>
     <l n="163">Nay though at Court , perhaps , it may find grace :</l>
     <l n="164">Such they 'll degrade ; and sometimes , in its stead ,</l>
     <l n="165">In downright charity revive the dead ;</l>
     <l n="166">Mark where a bold expressive phrase appears ,</l>
     <l n="167">Bright through the rubbish of some hundred years ;</l>
     <l n="168">Command old words that long have slept , to wake ,</l>
     <l n="169">Words that wise Bacon or brave Raleigh spake ;</l>
     <l n="170">Or bid the new be English , ages hence ,</l>
     <l n="171">( For use will farther what 's begot by sense )</l>
     <l n="172">Pour the full tide of eloquence along , }</l>
     <l n="173">Serenely pure , and yet divinely strong , }</l>
     <l n="174">Rich with the treasures of each foreign tongue ; }</l>
     <l n="175">Prune the luxuriant , the uncouth refine ,</l>
     <l n="176">But show no mercy to an empty line :</l>
     <l n="177">Then polish all , with so much life and ease ,</l>
     <l n="178">You think ‘ tis nature , and a knack to please :</l>
     <l n="179">“ But ease in writing flows from art , not chance ;</l>
     <l n="180">As those move easiest who have learned to dance . ”</l>
     <l n="181">If such the plague and pains to write by rule ,</l>
     <l n="182">Better , say I , be pleased and play the fool ;</l>
     <l n="183">Call , if you will , bad rhyming a disease ,</l>
     <l n="184">It gives men happiness , or leaves them ease .</l>
     <l n="185">There lived in primo Georgii , they record ,</l>
     <l n="186">A worthy member , no small fool , a lord ;</l>
     <l n="187">Who , though the House was up , delighted sate ,</l>
     <l n="188">Heard , noted , answered , as in full debate :</l>
     <l n="189">In all but this , a man of sober life ,</l>
     <l n="190">Fond of his friend , and civil to his wife ;</l>
     <l n="191">Not quite a madman , though a pasty fell ,</l>
     <l n="192">And much too wise to walk into a well .</l>
     <l n="193">Him , the damned doctors and his friends immured ,</l>
     <l n="194">They bled , they cupped , they purged ; in short , they cured .</l>
     <l n="195">Whereat the gentleman began to stare —</l>
     <l n="196">“ My friends ! ” he cried , “ plague take you for your care !</l>
     <l n="197">That from a patriot of distinguished note ,</l>
     <l n="198">Have bled and purged me to a simple vote . ”</l>
     <l n="199">Well , on the whole , plain prose must be my fate :</l>
     <l n="200">Wisdom ( curse on it ) will come soon or late .</l>
     <l n="201">There is a time when poets will grow dull :</l>
     <l n="202">I 'll e'en leave verses to the boys at school :</l>
     <l n="203">To rules of poetry no more confined ,</l>
     <l n="204">I learn to smooth and harmonise my mind ,</l>
     <l n="205">Teach every thought within its bounds to roll ,</l>
     <l n="206">And keep the equal measure of the soul .</l>
     <l n="207">Soon as I enter at my country door</l>
     <l n="208">My mind resumes the thread it dropt before ;</l>
     <l n="209">Thoughts , which at Hyde Park Corner I forgot ,</l>
     <l n="210">Meet and rejoin me , in the pensive grot .</l>
     <l n="211">There all alone , and compliments apart ,</l>
     <l n="212">I ask these sober questions of my heart .</l>
     <l n="213">If , when the more you drink , the more you crave ,</l>
     <l n="214">You tell the doctor ; when the more you have ,</l>
     <l n="215">The more you want ; why not with equal ease</l>
     <l n="216">Confess as well your folly , as disease ?</l>
     <l n="217">The heart resolves this matter in a thrice ,</l>
     <l n="218">“ Men only feel the smart but not the vice . ”</l>
     <l n="219">When golden angels cease to cure the evil ,</l>
     <l n="220">You give all royal witchcraft to the devil ;</l>
     <l n="221">When servile chaplains cry , that birth and place</l>
     <l n="222">Endure a peer with honour , truth , and grace ,</l>
     <l n="223">Look in that breast , most dirty D ——! be fair ,</l>
     <l n="224">Say , can you find out one such lodger there ?</l>
     <l n="225">Yet still , not heeding what your heart can teach ,</l>
     <l n="226">You go to church to hear these flatterers preach .</l>
     <l n="227">Indeed , could wealth bestow or wit or merit ,</l>
     <l n="228">A grain of courage , or a spark of spirit ,</l>
     <l n="229">The wisest man might blush , I must agree ,</l>
     <l n="230">If D *** loved sixpence more than he .</l>
     <l n="231">If there be truth in law , and use can give</l>
     <l n="232">A property , that 's yours on which you life .</l>
     <l n="233">Delightful Abs Court , if its fields afford</l>
     <l n="234">Their fruits to you , confesses you its lord ;</l>
     <l n="235">All Worldly 's hens , nay partridge , sold to town :</l>
     <l n="236">His venison too , a guinea makes your own :</l>
     <l n="237">He bought at thousands , what with better wit</l>
     <l n="238">You purchase as you want , and bit by bit ;</l>
     <l n="239">Now , or long since , what difference will be found ?</l>
     <l n="240">You pay a penny , and he paid a pound .</l>
     <l n="241">Heathcote himself , and such large-acred men ,</l>
     <l n="242">Lords of fat E'sham , or of Lincoln fen ,</l>
     <l n="243">Buy every stick of wood that lends them heat ,</l>
     <l n="244">Buy every pullet they afford to eat .</l>
     <l n="245">Yet these are wights , who fondly call their own</l>
     <l n="246">Half that the Devil o'erlooks from Lincoln town .</l>
     <l n="247">The laws of God , as well as of the land ,</l>
     <l n="248">Abhor , a perpetuity should stand :</l>
     <l n="249">Estates have wings and hang in fortune 's power</l>
     <l n="250">Loose on the point of every wavering hour ,</l>
     <l n="251">Ready , by force , or of your own accord ,</l>
     <l n="252">By sale , at least by death , to change their lord .</l>
     <l n="253">Man ? and for ever ? wretch ! what wouldst thou have ?</l>
     <l n="254">Heir urges heir , like wave impelling wave .</l>
     <l n="255">All vast possessions ( just the same the case</l>
     <l n="256">Whether you call them villa , park , or chase ) .</l>
     <l n="257">Alas , my Bathurst ! what will they avail ?</l>
     <l n="258">Join Cotswold hills to Saperton 's fair dale ,</l>
     <l n="259">Let rising granaries and temples here ,</l>
     <l n="260">There mingled farms and pyramids appear ,</l>
     <l n="261">Link towns to towns with avenues of oak ,</l>
     <l n="262">Enclose whole downs in walls , ‘ tis all a joke !</l>
     <l n="263">Inexorable death shall level all ,</l>
     <l n="264">And trees , and stones , and farms , and farmer fall .</l>
     <l n="265">Gold , silver , ivory , vases sculptured high ,</l>
     <l n="266">Paint , marble , gems , and robes of Persian dye ,</l>
     <l n="267">There are who have not — and thank heaven there are ,</l>
     <l n="268">Who , if they have not , think not worth their care ,</l>
     <l n="269">Talk what you will of taste , my friend , you 'll find ,</l>
     <l n="270">Two of a face , as soon as of a mind .</l>
     <l n="271">Why , of two brothers , rich and restless one</l>
     <l n="272">Ploughs , burns , manures , and toils from sun to sun ;</l>
     <l n="273">The other slights , for women , sports , and wines ,</l>
     <l n="274">All Townshend 's turnips , and all Grosvenor 's mines ;</l>
     <l n="275">Why one like Bu — with pay and scorn content ,</l>
     <l n="276">Bows and votes on , in Court and Parliament ;</l>
     <l n="277">One , driven by strong benevolence of soul ,</l>
     <l n="278">Shall fly , like Oglethorpe , from pole to pole ;</l>
     <l n="279">Is known alone to that directing power ,</l>
     <l n="280">Who forms the genius in the natal hour ;</l>
     <l n="281">That God of Nature , who , within us still ,</l>
     <l n="282">Inclines our action , not constrains our will :</l>
     <l n="283">Various of temper , as of face or frame .</l>
     <l n="284">Each individual : His great end the same .</l>
     <l n="285">Yes , sir , how small soever be my heap ,</l>
     <l n="286">A part I will enjoy , as well as keep .</l>
     <l n="287">My heir may sigh , and think it want of grace</l>
     <l n="288">A man so poor would live without a place ;</l>
     <l n="289">But sure no statute in his favour says</l>
     <l n="290">How free , or frugal , I shall pass my days :</l>
     <l n="291">I , who at some times spend , at others spare ,</l>
     <l n="292">Divided between carelessness and care .</l>
     <l n="293">‘ Tis one thing madly to disperse my store ;</l>
     <l n="294">Another , not to heed to treasure more !</l>
     <l n="295">Glad , like a boy , to snatch the first good day ,</l>
     <l n="296">And pleased , if sordid want be far away .</l>
     <l n="297">What is't to me ( a passenger , God wot )</l>
     <l n="298">Whether my vessel be first-rate or not ?</l>
     <l n="299">The ship itself may make a better figure ,</l>
     <l n="300">But I that sail , am neither less nor bigger ,</l>
     <l n="301">I neither strut with every favouring breath ,</l>
     <l n="302">Nor strive with all the tempest in my teeth .</l>
     <l n="303">In power , wit , figure , virtue , fortune , placed</l>
     <l n="304">Behind the foremost and before the last .</l>
     <l n="305">“ But why all this of avarice ? I have none . ”</l>
     <l n="306">I wish you joy , sir , of a tyrant gone ;</l>
     <l n="307">But does no other lord it at this hour ,</l>
     <l n="308">As wild and mad : the avarice of power ?</l>
     <l n="309">Does neither rage inflame , nor fear appal ?</l>
     <l n="310">Not the black fear of death , that saddens all ?</l>
     <l n="311">With terrors round , can Reason hold her throne ,</l>
     <l n="312">Despise the known , nor tremble at the unknown ?</l>
     <l n="313">Survey both worlds , intrepid and entire ,</l>
     <l n="314">In spite of witches , devils , dreams , and fire ?</l>
     <l n="315">Pleased to look forward , pleased to look behind ,</l>
     <l n="316">And count each birthday with a grateful mind ?</l>
     <l n="317">Has life no sourness , drawn so near its end ?</l>
     <l n="318">Canst thou endure a foe , forgive a friend ?</l>
     <l n="319">Has age but melted the rough parts away ,</l>
     <l n="320">As winter fruits grow mild ere they decay ?</l>
     <l n="321">Or will you think , my friend , your business done ,</l>
     <l n="322">When , of a hundred thorns , you pull out one ?</l>
     <l n="323">Learn to live well , or fairly make your will ;</l>
     <l n="324">You 've played , and loved , and ate , and drank your fill :</l>
     <l n="325">Walk sober off ; before a sprightlier age</l>
     <l n="326">Comes tittering on , and shoves you from the stage ;</l>
     <l n="327">Leave such to trifle with more grace and ease ,</l>
     <l n="328">Where folly pleases , and whose follies please .</l>

    <head>SATIRE II .</head>
     <l n="1">Yes ; thank my stars ! as early as I knew</l>
     <l n="2">This town , I had the sense to hate it too ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet here ; as even in hell , there must be still</l>
     <l n="4">One giant-vice , so excellently ill ,</l>
     <l n="5">That all beside , one pities , not abhors ;</l>
     <l n="6">As who knows Sappho , smiles at other whores .</l>
     <l n="7">I grant that poetry 's a crying sin ;</l>
     <l n="8">It brought ( no doubt ) the excise and army in :</l>
     <l n="9">Catched like the plague , or love , the Lord knows how ,</l>
     <l n="10">But that the cure is starving , all allow .</l>
     <l n="11">Yet like the Papist 's , is the poet 's state ,</l>
     <l n="12">Poor and disarmed , and hardly worth your hate !</l>
     <l n="13">Here a lean bard , whose wit could never give</l>
     <l n="14">Himself a dinner , makes an actor live :</l>
     <l n="15">The thief condemned , in law already dead ,</l>
     <l n="16">So prompts , and saves a rogue who cannot read .</l>
     <l n="17">Thus , as the pipes of some carved organ move ,</l>
     <l n="18">The gilded puppets dance and mount above .</l>
     <l n="19">Heaved by the breath the inspiring bellows blow :</l>
     <l n="20">The inspiring bellows lie and pant below .</l>
     <l n="21">One sings the fair ; but songs no longer move ;</l>
     <l n="22">No rat is rhymed to death , nor maid to love :</l>
     <l n="23">In love 's , in nature 's spite , the siege they hold ,</l>
     <l n="24">And scorn the flesh , the devil , and all but gold .</l>
     <l n="25">These write to lords , some mean reward to get ,</l>
     <l n="26">As needy beggars sing at doors for meat .</l>
     <l n="27">Those write because all write , and so have still</l>
     <l n="28">Excuse for writing , and for writing ill .</l>
     <l n="29">Wretched , indeed ! but far more wretched yet</l>
     <l n="30">Is he who makes his meal on others ’ wit :</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Tis changed , no doubt , from what it was before ;</l>
     <l n="32">His rank digestion makes it wit no more :</l>
     <l n="33">Sense , past through him , no longer is the same ;</l>
     <l n="34">For food digested takes another name .</l>
     <l n="35">I pass o'er all those confessors and martyrs</l>
     <l n="36">Who live like S-tt-n , or who die like Chartres ,</l>
     <l n="37">Out-cant old Esdras , or out-drink his heir ,</l>
     <l n="38">Out-usure Jews , or Irishmen out-swear ;</l>
     <l n="39">Wicked as pages , who in early years</l>
     <l n="40">Act sins which Prisca 's confessor scarce hears .</l>
     <l n="41">Even those I pardon , for whose sinful sake</l>
     <l n="42">Schoolmen new tenements in hell must make ;</l>
     <l n="43">Of whose strange crimes no canonist can tell</l>
     <l n="44">In what Commandment 's large contents they dwell .</l>
     <l n="45">One , one man only breeds my just offence ;</l>
     <l n="46">Whom crimes gave wealth , and wealth gave impudence :</l>
     <l n="47">Time brings all natural events to pass ,</l>
     <l n="48">And made him an attorney of an ass .</l>
     <l n="49">No young divine , new beneficed , can be</l>
     <l n="50">More pert , more proud , more positive than he .</l>
     <l n="51">What further could I wish the fop to do ,</l>
     <l n="52">But turn a wit , and scribble verses too ;</l>
     <l n="53">Pierce the soft labyrinth of a lady 's ear</l>
     <l n="54">With rhymes of this per cent . and that per year ?</l>
     <l n="55">Or court a wife , spread out his wily parts ,</l>
     <l n="56">Like nets or lime-twigs , for rich widows ’ hearts ;</l>
     <l n="57">Call himself barrister to every wench ,</l>
     <l n="58">And woo in language of the pleas and bench ?</l>
     <l n="59">Language , which Boreas might to Auster hold</l>
     <l n="60">More rough than forty Germans when they scold .</l>
     <l n="61">Cursed be the wretch , so venal and so vain :</l>
     <l n="62">Paltry and proud , as drabs in Drury Lane .</l>
     <l n="63">‘ Tis such a bounty as was never known ,</l>
     <l n="64">If Peter deigns to help you to your own :</l>
     <l n="65">What thanks , what praise , if Peter but supplies ,</l>
     <l n="66">And what a solemn face if he denies !</l>
     <l n="67">Grave , as when prisoners shake the head and swear</l>
     <l n="68">‘ Twas only suretyship that brought ‘ em there .</l>
     <l n="69">His office keeps your parchment fates entire ,</l>
     <l n="70">He starves with cold to save them from the fire ;</l>
     <l n="71">For you he walks the streets through rain or dust ,</l>
     <l n="72">For not in chariots Peter puts his trust ;</l>
     <l n="73">For you he sweats and labours at the laws ,</l>
     <l n="74">Takes God to witness he affects your cause ,</l>
     <l n="75">And lies to every lord in every thing ,</l>
     <l n="76">Like a king 's favourite — or like a king .</l>
     <l n="77">These are the talents that adorn them all ,</l>
     <l n="78">From wicked waters even to godly * *</l>
     <l n="79">Not more of simony beneath black gowns ,</l>
     <l n="80">Nor more of bastardy in heirs to crowns .</l>
     <l n="81">In shillings and in pence at first they deal ;</l>
     <l n="82">And steal so little , few perceive they steal ;</l>
     <l n="83">Till , like the sea , they compass all the land ,</l>
     <l n="84">From Scots to Wight , from mount to Dover strand :</l>
     <l n="85">And when rank widows purchase luscious nights ,</l>
     <l n="86">Or when a duke to Jansen punts at White 's ,</l>
     <l n="87">Or City-heir in mortgage melts away ;</l>
     <l n="88">Satan himself feels far less joy than they .</l>
     <l n="89">Piecemeal they win this acre first , then that ,</l>
     <l n="90">Glean on , and gather up the whole estate .</l>
     <l n="91">Then strongly fencing ill-got wealth by law ,</l>
     <l n="92">Indentures , covenants , articles thy draw ,</l>
     <l n="93">Large as the fields themselves , and larger far</l>
     <l n="94">Than civil codes , with all their glosses , are ;</l>
     <l n="95">So vast , our new divines , we must confess ,</l>
     <l n="96">Are fathers of the Church for writing less .</l>
     <l n="97">But let them write for you , each rogue impairs</l>
     <l n="98">The deeds , and dexterously omits , ses heires ;</l>
     <l n="99">No commentator can more slily pass</l>
     <l n="100">O'er a learned , unintelligible place ;</l>
     <l n="101">Or , in quotation , shrewd divines leave out</l>
     <l n="102">Those words , that would against them clear the doubt .</l>
     <l n="103">So Luther thought the Paternoster long ,</l>
     <l n="104">When doomed to say his beads and even-song ;</l>
     <l n="105">But having cast his cowl , and left those laws ,</l>
     <l n="106">Adds to Christ 's prayer , the Power and Glory clause .</l>
     <l n="107">The lands are bought ; but where are to be found</l>
     <l n="108">Those ancient woods , that shaded all the ground ?</l>
     <l n="109">We see no new-built palaces aspire ,</l>
     <l n="110">No kitchens emulate the vestal fire .</l>
     <l n="111">Where are those troops of poor , that thronged of yore</l>
     <l n="112">The good old landlord 's hospitable door ?</l>
     <l n="113">Well , I could wish , that still in lordly domes</l>
     <l n="114">Some beasts were killed , though not whole hecatombs ;</l>
     <l n="115">That both extremes were banished from their walls ,</l>
     <l n="116">Carthusian fasts , and fulsome bacchanals ;</l>
     <l n="117">And all mankind might that just mean observe ,</l>
     <l n="118">In which none e'er could surfeit , none could starve .</l>
     <l n="119">These as good works , ‘ tis true , we all allow ;</l>
     <l n="120">But oh ! these works are not in fashion now :</l>
     <l n="121">Like rich old wardrobes , things extremely rare ,</l>
     <l n="122">Extremely fine , but what no man will wear .</l>
     <l n="123">Thus much I 've said , I trust , without offence ;</l>
     <l n="124">Let no Court sycophant pervert my sense ,</l>
     <l n="125">Nor sly informer watch these words to draw</l>
     <l n="126">Within the reach of treason , or the law .</l>

    <head>SATIRE IV .</head>
     <l n="1">Well , if it be my time to quit the stage ,</l>
     <l n="2">Adieu to all the follies of the age !</l>
     <l n="3">I die in charity with fool and knave ,</l>
     <l n="4">Secure of peace at least beyond the grave .</l>
     <l n="5">I 've had my purgatory here betimes ,</l>
     <l n="6">And paid for all my satires , all my rhymes .</l>
     <l n="7">The poet 's hell , its tortures , fiends , and flames ,</l>
     <l n="8">To this were trifles , toys , and empty names .</l>
     <l n="9">With foolish pride my heart was never fired ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor the vain itch to admire , or be admired ;</l>
     <l n="11">I hoped for no commission from his Grace ;</l>
     <l n="12">I bought no benefice , I begged no place ;</l>
     <l n="13">Had no new verses , nor new suit to show ;</l>
     <l n="14">Yet went to Court !— the Devil would have it so .</l>
     <l n="15">But , as the fool that in reforming days</l>
     <l n="16">Would go to Mass in jest ( as story says )</l>
     <l n="17">Could not but think , to pay his fine was odd ,</l>
     <l n="18">Since ‘ twas no formed design of serving God ;</l>
     <l n="19">So was I punished , as if full as proud</l>
     <l n="20">As prone to ill , as negligent of good ,</l>
     <l n="21">As deep in debt , without a thought to pay , }</l>
     <l n="22">As vain , as idle , and as false , as they }</l>
     <l n="23">Who live at Court , for going once that way ! }</l>
     <l n="24">Scarce was I entered , when , behold ! there came</l>
     <l n="25">A thing which Adam had been posed to name ;</l>
     <l n="26">Noah had refused it lodging in his Ark ,</l>
     <l n="27">Where all the race of reptiles might embark :</l>
     <l n="28">A verier monster , that on Afric 's shore</l>
     <l n="29">The sun e'er got , or slimy Nilus bore ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or Sloane or Woodward 's wondrous shelves contain ,</l>
     <l n="31">Nay , all that lying travellers can feign .</l>
     <l n="32">The watch would hardly let him pass at noon ,</l>
     <l n="33">At night , would swear him dropped out of the moon .</l>
     <l n="34">One whom the mob , when next we find or make</l>
     <l n="35">A Popish plot , shall for a Jesuit take ,</l>
     <l n="36">And the wise Justice starting from his chair</l>
     <l n="37">Cry : “ By your priesthood tell me what you are ? ”</l>
     <l n="38">Such was the wight ; the apparel on his back</l>
     <l n="39">Though coarse , was reverend , and though bare , was black :</l>
     <l n="40">The suit , if by the fashion one might guess ,</l>
     <l n="41">Was velvet in the youth of good Queen Bess ,</l>
     <l n="42">But mere tuff-taffety what now remained ;</l>
     <l n="43">So time , that changes all things , had ordained !</l>
     <l n="44">Our sons shall see it leisurely decay ,</l>
     <l n="45">First turn plain rash , then vanish quite away .</l>
     <l n="46">This thing has travelled , speaks each language too ,</l>
     <l n="47">And know what 's fit for very state to do ;</l>
     <l n="48">Of whose best phrase and courtly accent joined ,</l>
     <l n="49">He forms one tongue , exotic and refined ,</l>
     <l n="50">Talkers I 've learned to bear ; Motteux I knew ,</l>
     <l n="51">Henley himself I 've heard , and Budgel too .</l>
     <l n="52">The doctor 's wormwood style , the hash of tongues</l>
     <l n="53">A pedant makes , the storm of Gonson 's lungs ,</l>
     <l n="54">The whole artillery of the terms of war ,</l>
     <l n="55">And ( all those plagues in one ) the bawling bar :</l>
     <l n="56">These I could bear ; but not a rogue so civil ,</l>
     <l n="57">Whose tongue will compliment you to the devil .</l>
     <l n="58">A tongue that can cheat widows , cancel scores ,</l>
     <l n="59">Make Scots speak treason , cozen subtlest w *** es ,</l>
     <l n="60">With royal favourites in flattery vie ,</l>
     <l n="61">And Oldmixon and Burnet both outlie .</l>
     <l n="62">He spies me out , I whisper : “ Gracious God !</l>
     <l n="63">What sin of mine could merit such a rod ?</l>
     <l n="64">That all the shot of dulness now must be</l>
     <l n="65">From this thy blunderbuss discharged on me ! ”</l>
     <l n="66">“ Permit ” ( he cries ) “ no stranger to your fame</l>
     <l n="67">To crave your sentiment , if —— ‘ s your name .</l>
     <l n="68">What speech esteem you most ? ” “ The King 's , ” said I</l>
     <l n="69">“ But the best words ? ” — “ O , sir , the dictionary . ”</l>
     <l n="70">“ You miss my aim ; I mean the most acute</l>
     <l n="71">And perfect speaker ? ” — “ Onslow , past dispute . ”</l>
     <l n="72">“ But , sir , of writers ? ” “ Swift , for closer style ,</l>
     <l n="73">But Ho ** y for a period of a mile . ”</l>
     <l n="74">“ Why , yes , ‘ tis granted , these indeed may pass :</l>
     <l n="75">Good common linguists , and so Panurge was ;</l>
     <l n="76">Nay troth the Apostles ( though perhaps too rough )</l>
     <l n="77">Had once a pretty gift of tongues enough :</l>
     <l n="78">Yet these were all poor gentlemen ! I dare</l>
     <l n="79">Affirm , ‘ twas travel made them what they were . ”</l>
     <l n="80">Thus others ’ talents having nicely shown ,</l>
     <l n="81">He came by sure transition to his own :</l>
     <l n="82">Till I cried out : “ You prove yourself so able ,</l>
     <l n="83">Pity ! you was not Druggerman at Babel ;</l>
     <l n="84">For had they found a linguist half so good</l>
     <l n="85">I make no question but the tower had stood . ”</l>
     <l n="86">“ Obliging sir ! for courts you sure were made :</l>
     <l n="87">Why then for ever buried in the shade ?</l>
     <l n="88">Spirits like you should see and should be seen ,</l>
     <l n="89">The King would smile on you — at least the Queen . ”</l>
     <l n="90">“ Ah , gentle sir ! you courtiers so cajole us —</l>
     <l n="91">But Tully has it , Nunquam minus solus :</l>
     <l n="92">And as for courts , forgive me , if I say</l>
     <l n="93">No lessons now are taught the Spartan way :</l>
     <l n="94">Though in his pictures lust be full displayed ,</l>
     <l n="95">Few are the converts Aretine has made ;</l>
     <l n="96">And though the Court show vice exceeding clear ,</l>
     <l n="97">None should , by my advice , learn virtue there . ”</l>
     <l n="98">At this entranced , he lifts his hands and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="99">Squeaks like a high-stretched lutestring , and replies :</l>
     <l n="100">“ Oh , ‘ tis the sweetest of all earthly things</l>
     <l n="101">To gaze on princes , and to talk of kings ! ”</l>
     <l n="102">“ Then , happy man who shows the tombs ! ” said I ,</l>
     <l n="103">“ He dwells amidst the Royal Family ;</l>
     <l n="104">He every day , from king to king can walk ,</l>
     <l n="105">Of all our Harries , all our Edwards talk ,</l>
     <l n="106">And get by speaking truth of monarchs dead ,</l>
     <l n="107">What few can of the living , ease and bread . ”</l>
     <l n="108">“ Lord , sir , a mere mechanic ! strangely low ,</l>
     <l n="109">And coarse of phrase — your English all are so .</l>
     <l n="110">How elegant your Frenchmen ? ” “ Mine , d'ye mean ?</l>
     <l n="111">I have but one , I hope the fellow 's clean . ”</l>
     <l n="112">“ Oh ! sir , politely so ! nay , let me die ,</l>
     <l n="113">Your only wearing is your Paduasoy . ”</l>
     <l n="114">“ Not , sir , my only , I have better still ,</l>
     <l n="115">And this you see is but my dishabille —. ”</l>
     <l n="116">Wild to get loose , his patience I provoke ,</l>
     <l n="117">Mistake , confound , object at all he spoke .</l>
     <l n="118">But as coarse iron , sharpened , mangles more ,</l>
     <l n="119">And itch most hurts when angered to a sore ;</l>
     <l n="120">So when you plague a fool , ‘ tis still the curse ,</l>
     <l n="121">You only make the matter worse and worse .</l>
     <l n="122">He past it o'er ; affects an easy smile</l>
     <l n="123">At all my peevishness , and turns his style .</l>
     <l n="124">He asks , “ What news ? ” I tell him of new plays ,</l>
     <l n="125">New eunuchs , harlequins , and operas .</l>
     <l n="126">He hears , and as a still with simples in it</l>
     <l n="127">Between each drop it gives , stays half a minute ,</l>
     <l n="128">Loth to enrich me with too quick replies ,</l>
     <l n="129">By little and by little drops his lies .</l>
     <l n="130">Mere household trash ! of birth-nights , balls , and shows ,</l>
     <l n="131">More than ten Holinsheds , or Halls , or Stowes .</l>
     <l n="132">When the Queen frowned , or smiled , he knows ; and what</l>
     <l n="133">A subtle minister may make of that ;</l>
     <l n="134">Who sins with whom : who got his pension rug ,</l>
     <l n="135">Or quickened a reversion by a drug ;</l>
     <l n="136">Whose place is quartered out , three parts in four ,</l>
     <l n="137">And whether to a bishop , or a w *** e ;</l>
     <l n="138">Who having lost his credit , pawned his rent ,</l>
     <l n="139">Is therefore fit to have a Government ;</l>
     <l n="140">Who in the secret , deals in stocks secure ,</l>
     <l n="141">And cheats the unknowing widow and the poor ;</l>
     <l n="142">Who makes a trust or charity a job ,</l>
     <l n="143">And gets an Act of Parliament to rob ;</l>
     <l n="144">Why turnpikes rise , and now no cit nor clown</l>
     <l n="145">Can gratis see the country , or the town ;</l>
     <l n="146">Shortly no lad shall chuck , or lady vole ,</l>
     <l n="147">But some excising courtier will have toll .</l>
     <l n="148">He tells what strumpet places sells for life ,</l>
     <l n="149">What ‘ squire his lands , what citizen his wife :</l>
     <l n="150">And last ( which proves him wiser still than all )</l>
     <l n="151">What lady 's face is not a whited wall .</l>
     <l n="152">As one of Woodward 's patients , sick , and sore ,</l>
     <l n="153">I puke , I nauseate — yet he thrusts in more :</l>
     <l n="154">Trims Europe 's balance , tops the statesman 's part ,</l>
     <l n="155">And talks gazettes and post-boys o'er by heart .</l>
     <l n="156">Like a big wife at sight of loathsome meat</l>
     <l n="157">Ready to cast , I yawn , I sigh and sweat .</l>
     <l n="158">Then as a licensed spy , whom nothing can</l>
     <l n="159">Silence or hurt , he libels the great man ;</l>
     <l n="160">Swears every place entailed for years to come ,</l>
     <l n="161">In sure succession to the day of doom ;</l>
     <l n="162">He names the price for every office paid ,</l>
     <l n="163">And says our wars thrive ill , because delayed ;</l>
     <l n="164">Nay hints , ‘ tis by connivance of the Court ,</l>
     <l n="165">That Spain robs on , and Dunkirk 's still a port .</l>
     <l n="166">Not more amazement seized on Circe 's guests ,</l>
     <l n="167">To see themselves fall endlong into beasts ,</l>
     <l n="168">Than mine , to find a subject staid and wise</l>
     <l n="169">Already half turned traitor by surprise .</l>
     <l n="170">I felt the infection slide from him to me ,</l>
     <l n="171">As in the —— some give it to get free ;</l>
     <l n="172">And quick to swallow me , methought I saw</l>
     <l n="173">One of our giant statutes ope its jaw .</l>
     <l n="174">In that nice moment , as another lie</l>
     <l n="175">Stood just a-tilt , the minister came by .</l>
     <l n="176">To him he flies , and bows , and bows again ,</l>
     <l n="177">Then , close as Umbra , joins the dirty train .</l>
     <l n="178">Not Fannius ’ self more impudently near ,</l>
     <l n="179">When half his nose is in his Prince 's ear .</l>
     <l n="180">I quaked at heart ; and still afraid , to see</l>
     <l n="181">All the Court filled with stranger things than he ,</l>
     <l n="182">Ran out as fast as one that pays his bail</l>
     <l n="183">And dreads more actions , hurries from a jail .</l>
     <l n="184">Bear me , some god ! oh , quickly bear me hence</l>
     <l n="185">To wholesome solitude , the nurse of sense :</l>
     <l n="186">Where Contemplation plumes her ruffled wings ,</l>
     <l n="187">And the free soul looks down to pity kings !</l>
     <l n="188">There sober thought pursued the amusing theme ,</l>
     <l n="189">Till fancy coloured it , and formed a dream .</l>
     <l n="190">A vision hermits can to hell transport ,</l>
     <l n="191">And forced even me to see the damned at Court .</l>
     <l n="192">Not Dante dreaming all the infernal state ,</l>
     <l n="193">Beheld such scenes of envy , sin , and hate .</l>
     <l n="194">Base fear becomes the guilty , not the free ;</l>
     <l n="195">Suits tyrants , plunderers , but suits not me :</l>
     <l n="196">Shall I , the terror of this sinful town ,</l>
     <l n="197">Care , if a liveried lord or smile or frown ?</l>
     <l n="198">Who cannot flatter , and detest who can ,</l>
     <l n="199">Tremble before a noble serving-man ?</l>
     <l n="200">O , my fair mistress , Truth ! shall I quit thee</l>
     <l n="201">For huffing , braggart , puffed nobility ?</l>
     <l n="202">Thou , who since yesterday hast rolled o'er all</l>
     <l n="203">The busy , idle blockheads of the ball ,</l>
     <l n="204">Hast thou , oh , sun ! beheld an emptier fort ,</l>
     <l n="205">Than such who swell this bladder of a Court ?</l>
     <l n="206">Now plague on those who show a Court in wax !</l>
     <l n="207">It ought to bring all courtiers on their backs :</l>
     <l n="208">Such painted puppets ! such a varnished race</l>
     <l n="209">Of hollow gewgaws , only dress and face !</l>
     <l n="210">Such waxen noses , stately staring things —</l>
     <l n="211">No wonder some folks bow , and think them kings .</l>
     <l n="212">See ! where the British youth , engaged no more</l>
     <l n="213">At Fig 's , at White 's , with felons , or a bore ,</l>
     <l n="214">Pay their last duty to the Court and come</l>
     <l n="215">All fresh and fragrant , to the drawing-room ;</l>
     <l n="216">In hues as gay , and odours as divine ,</l>
     <l n="217">As the fair fields they sold to look so fine .</l>
     <l n="218">“ That 's velvet for a king ! ” the flatterer swears</l>
     <l n="219">‘ Tis true , for ten days hence ‘ twill be King Lear 's .</l>
     <l n="220">Our Court may justly to our stage give rules ,</l>
     <l n="221">That helps it both to fools-coats and to fools .</l>
     <l n="222">And why not players strut in courtiers ’ clothes ?</l>
     <l n="223">For these are actors too , as well as those :</l>
     <l n="224">Wants reach all states ; they beg but better drest ,</l>
     <l n="225">And all is splended poverty at best .</l>
     <l n="226">Painted for sight , and essenced for the smell ,</l>
     <l n="227">Like frigates fraught with spice and cochinel ,</l>
     <l n="228">Sail in the ladies : how each pirate eyes</l>
     <l n="229">So weak a vessel , and so rich a prize !</l>
     <l n="230">Top-gallant he , and she in all her trim ,</l>
     <l n="231">He boarding her , she striking sail to him :</l>
     <l n="232">“ Dear Countess ! you have charms all hearts to hit ! ”</l>
     <l n="233">And “ Sweet Sir Fopling ! you have so much wit ! ”</l>
     <l n="234">Such wits and beauties are not praised for nought ,</l>
     <l n="235">For both the beauty and the wit are bought .</l>
     <l n="236">‘ Twould burst even Heraclitus with the spleen</l>
     <l n="237">To see those antics , Fopling and Courtin :</l>
     <l n="238">The presence seems , with things so richly odd ,</l>
     <l n="239">The mosque of Mahound , or some queer Pagod .</l>
     <l n="240">See them survey their limbs by Durer 's rules ,</l>
     <l n="241">Of all beau-kind the best proportioned fools !</l>
     <l n="242">Adjust their clothes , and to confession draw</l>
     <l n="243">Those venial sins , an atom , or a straw ;</l>
     <l n="244">But oh ! what terrors must distract the soul</l>
     <l n="245">Convicted of that mortal crime , a hole ;</l>
     <l n="246">Or should one pound of powder less bespread</l>
     <l n="247">Those monkey tails that wag behind their head .</l>
     <l n="248">Thus finished , and corrected to a hair ,</l>
     <l n="249">They march , to prate their hour before the fair .</l>
     <l n="250">So first to preach a white-gloved chaplain goes ,</l>
     <l n="251">With band of lily , and with cheek of rose ,</l>
     <l n="252">Sweeter than Sharon , in immaculate trim ,</l>
     <l n="253">Neatness itself impertinent in him .</l>
     <l n="254">Let but the ladies smile , and they are blest :</l>
     <l n="255">Prodigious ! how the things protest , protest :</l>
     <l n="256">Peace , fools , or Gonson will for Papists seize you ,</l>
     <l n="257">If once he catch you at your Jesu ! Jesu !</l>
     <l n="258">Nature made every fop to plague his brother ,</l>
     <l n="259">Just as one beauty mortifies another .</l>
     <l n="260">But here 's the captain that will plague them both ,</l>
     <l n="261">Whose air cries Arm ! whose very look 's an oath :</l>
     <l n="262">The captain 's honest , Sirs , and that 's enough ,</l>
     <l n="263">Though his soul 's bullet , and his body buff .</l>
     <l n="264">He spits fore-right ; his haughty chest before ,</l>
     <l n="265">Like battering rams , beats open every door :</l>
     <l n="266">And with a face as red , and as awry ,</l>
     <l n="267">As Herod 's hangdogs in old tapestry ,</l>
     <l n="268">Scarecrow to boys , the breeding woman 's curse ,</l>
     <l n="269">Has yet a strange ambition to look worse ;</l>
     <l n="270">Confounds the civil , keeps the rude in awe ,</l>
     <l n="271">Jests like a licensed fool , commands like law .</l>
     <l n="272">Frighted , I quit the room , but leave it so</l>
     <l n="273">As men from jails to execution go ;</l>
     <l n="274">For hung with deadly sins I see the wall ,</l>
     <l n="275">And lined with giants deadlier than ‘ em all :</l>
     <l n="276">Each man an Askapart , of strength to toss</l>
     <l n="277">For quoits , both Temple Bar and Charing Cross .</l>
     <l n="278">Scared at the grizzly forms , I sweat , I fly ,</l>
     <l n="279">And shake all o'er , like a discovered spy .</l>
     <l n="280">Courts are too much for wits so weak as mine :</l>
     <l n="281">Charge them with Heaven 's artillery , bold divine !</l>
     <l n="282">From such alone the great rebukes endure</l>
     <l n="283">Whose satire 's sacred , and whose rage secure :</l>
     <l n="284">‘ Tis mine to wash a few light stains , but theirs</l>
     <l n="285">To deluge sin , and drown a Court in tears .</l>
     <l n="286">However , what 's now Apocrypha , my wit ,</l>
     <l n="287">In time to come , may pass for holy writ .</l>

   <p>EPILOGUE TO THE SATIRES . IN TWO DIALOGUES . WRITTEN IN MDCCXXXVIII .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>DIALOGUE I .</head>
     <l n="1">Fr . Not twice a twelvemonth you appear in print ,</l>
     <l n="2">And when it comes , the Court see nothing i n't .</l>
     <l n="3">You grow correct , that once with rapture writ ,</l>
     <l n="4">And are , besides , too moral for a wit .</l>
     <l n="5">Decay of parts , alas ! we all must feel —</l>
     <l n="6">Why now , this moment , do n't I see you steal ?</l>
     <l n="7">‘ Tis all from Horace ; Horace long before ye</l>
     <l n="8">Said , “ Tories called him Whig , and Whigs a Tory ; ”</l>
     <l n="9">And taught his Romans , in much better metre ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ To laugh at fools who put their trust in Peter . ”</l>
     <l n="11">But Horace , sir , was delicate , was nice ;</l>
     <l n="12">Bubo observes , he lashed no sort of vice ;</l>
     <l n="13">Horace would say , Sir Billy served the crown ,</l>
     <l n="14">Blunt could do business , H-ggins knew the town ;</l>
     <l n="15">In Sappho touch the failings of the sex ,</l>
     <l n="16">In reverend bishops note some small neglects ,</l>
     <l n="17">And own , the Spaniard did a waggish thing ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who cropped our ears , and sent them to the king .</l>
     <l n="19">His sly , polite , insinuating style</l>
     <l n="20">Could please at Court , and make Augustus smile :</l>
     <l n="21">An artful manager , that crept between</l>
     <l n="22">His friend and shame , and was a kind of screen .</l>
     <l n="23">But ‘ faith , your friends will soon be sore ;</l>
     <l n="24">Patriots there are , who wish you 'd jest no more —</l>
     <l n="25">And where 's the glory ? ‘ twill be only thought</l>
     <l n="26">The Great Man never offered you a groat .</l>
     <l n="27">Go , see Sir Robert — P. See Sir Robert !— hum —</l>
     <l n="28">And never laugh — for all my life to come ?</l>
     <l n="29">Seen him I have , but in his happier hour</l>
     <l n="30">Of social pleasure , ill-exchanged for power ;</l>
     <l n="31">Seen him , unencumbered with the venal tribe ,</l>
     <l n="32">Smile without art , and win without a bribe .</l>
     <l n="33">Would he oblige me ? let me only find</l>
     <l n="34">He does not think me what he thinks mankind .</l>
     <l n="35">Come , come , at all I laugh he laughs , no doubt ;</l>
     <l n="36">The only difference is I dare laugh out .</l>
     <l n="37">F. Why , yes : with Scripture still you may be free ;</l>
     <l n="38">A horse-laugh , if you please , at honesty :</l>
     <l n="39">A joke on Jekyl , or some odd old Whig</l>
     <l n="40">Who never changed his principle , or wig :</l>
     <l n="41">A patriot is a fool in every age ,</l>
     <l n="42">Whom all Lord Chamberlains allow the stage :</l>
     <l n="43">These nothing hurts ; they keep their fashion still ,</l>
     <l n="44">And wear their strange old virtue , as they will .</l>
     <l n="45">If any ask you , “ Who 's the man , so near</l>
     <l n="46">His prince , that writes in verse , and has his ear ? ”</l>
     <l n="47">Why , answer , Lyttelton , and I 'll engage</l>
     <l n="48">The worthy youth shall ne'er be in a rage ;</l>
     <l n="49">But were his verses vile , his whisper base ,</l>
     <l n="50">You 'd quickly find him in Lord Fanny 's case .</l>
     <l n="51">Sejanus , Wolsey , hurt not honest Fleury ,</l>
     <l n="52">But well may put some statesmen in a fury .</l>
     <l n="53">Laugh , then , at any , but at fools or foes ;</l>
     <l n="54">These you but anger , and you mend not those .</l>
     <l n="55">Laugh at your friends , and , if your friends are sore ,</l>
     <l n="56">So much the better , you may laugh the more .</l>
     <l n="57">To vice and folly to confine the jest ,</l>
     <l n="58">Sets half the world , God knows , against the rest ;</l>
     <l n="59">Did not the sneer of more impartial men</l>
     <l n="60">At sense and virtue , balance all again .</l>
     <l n="61">Judicious wits spread wide the ridicule ,</l>
     <l n="62">And charitably comfort knave and fool .</l>
     <l n="63">P. Dear sir , forgive the prejudice of youth ;</l>
     <l n="64">Adieu distinction , satire , warmth , and truth !</l>
     <l n="65">Come , harmless characters , that no one hit ;</l>
     <l n="66">Come , Henley 's oratory , Osborne 's wit !</l>
     <l n="67">The honey dropping from Favonio 's tongue ,</l>
     <l n="68">The flowers of Bubo , and the flow of Y — ng !</l>
     <l n="69">The gracious dew of pulpit eloquence ,</l>
     <l n="70">And all the well-whipped cream of courtly sense ,</l>
     <l n="71">That first was H — vy 's , F — -  ‘ s next , and then</l>
     <l n="72">The S — te 's , and then H — vy 's once again .</l>
     <l n="73">O , come , that easy Ciceronian style ,</l>
     <l n="74">So Latin , yet so English all the while ,</l>
     <l n="75">As , though the pride of Middleton and Bland ,</l>
     <l n="76">All boys may read , and girls may understand !</l>
     <l n="77">Then might I sing , without the least offence ,</l>
     <l n="78">And all I sung should be the nation 's sense ;</l>
     <l n="79">Or teach the melancholy muse to mourn ,</l>
     <l n="80">Hang the sad verse on Carolina 's urn ,</l>
     <l n="81">And hail her passage to the realms of rest ,</l>
     <l n="82">All parts performed , and all her children blessed !</l>
     <l n="83">So — satire is no more — I feel it die —</l>
     <l n="84">No Gazetteer more innocent than I —</l>
     <l n="85">And let , a ’ God 's name , every fool and knave</l>
     <l n="86">Be graced through life , and flattered in his grave .</l>
     <l n="87">F. Why so ? if satire knows its time and place</l>
     <l n="88">You still may lash the greatest — in disgrace :</l>
     <l n="89">For merit will by turns forsake them all ;</l>
     <l n="90">Would you know when ? exactly when they fall .</l>
     <l n="91">But let all satire in all changes spare</l>
     <l n="92">Immortal S — k , and grave De — re .</l>
     <l n="93">Silent and soft , as saints remove to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="94">All ties dissolved and every sin forgiven ,</l>
     <l n="95">These may some gentle ministerial wing</l>
     <l n="96">Receive , and place for ever near a king !</l>
     <l n="97">There , where no passion , pride , or shame transport ,</l>
     <l n="98">Lulled with the sweet nepenthe of a Court ;</l>
     <l n="99">There , where no father 's , brother 's , friend 's disgrace</l>
     <l n="100">Once break their rest , or stir them from their place :</l>
     <l n="101">But past the sense of human miseries ,</l>
     <l n="102">All tears are wiped for ever from all eyes ;</l>
     <l n="103">No cheek is known to blush , no heart to throb ,</l>
     <l n="104">Save when they lose a question , or a job .</l>
     <l n="105">P. Good Heaven forbid , that I should blast their glory ,</l>
     <l n="106">Who know how like Whig ministers to Tory ,</l>
     <l n="107">And , when three sovereigns died , could scarce be vexed ,</l>
     <l n="108">Considering what a gracious prince was next .</l>
     <l n="109">Have I , in silent wonder , seen such things</l>
     <l n="110">As pride in slaves , and avarice in kings ;</l>
     <l n="111">And at a peer , or peeress , shall I fret ,</l>
     <l n="112">Who starves a sister , or forswears a debt ?</l>
     <l n="113">Virtue , I grant you , is an empty boast ;</l>
     <l n="114">But shall the dignity of vice be lost ?</l>
     <l n="115">Ye gods ! shall Cibber 's son , without rebuke ,</l>
     <l n="116">Swear like a lord , or rich out-rake a duke ?</l>
     <l n="117">A favourite 's porter with his master vie ,</l>
     <l n="118">Be bribed as often , and as often lie ?</l>
     <l n="119">Shall Ward draw contracts with a statesman 's skill ?</l>
     <l n="120">Or Japhet pocket , like his grace , a will ?</l>
     <l n="121">Is it for Bond or Peter ( paltry things )</l>
     <l n="122">To pay their debts , or keep their faith , like kings ?</l>
     <l n="123">If Blount despatched himself , he played the man ,</l>
     <l n="124">And so may'st thou , illustrious Passeran !</l>
     <l n="125">But shall a printer , weary of his life ,</l>
     <l n="126">Learn , from their books , to hang himself and wife ?</l>
     <l n="127">This , this , my friend , I cannot , must not bear ;</l>
     <l n="128">Vice thus abused , demands a nation 's care ;</l>
     <l n="129">This calls the Church to deprecate our sin ,</l>
     <l n="130">And hurls the thunder of the laws on gin .</l>
     <l n="131">Let modest Foster , if he will , excel</l>
     <l n="132">Ten Metropolitans in preaching well ;</l>
     <l n="133">A simple Quaker , or a Quaker 's wife ,</l>
     <l n="134">Outdo Llandaff in doctrine — yea in life :</l>
     <l n="135">Let humble Allen , with an awkward shame ,</l>
     <l n="136">Do good by stealth , and blush to find it fame .</l>
     <l n="137">Virtue may choose the high or low degree ,</l>
     <l n="138">‘ Tis just alike to virtue , and to me ;</l>
     <l n="139">Dwell in a monk , or light upon a king ,</l>
     <l n="140">She 's still the same , beloved , contented thing .</l>
     <l n="141">Vice is undone , if she forgets her birth ,</l>
     <l n="142">And stoops from angels to the dregs of earth :</l>
     <l n="143">But ‘ tis the Fall degrades her to a w *** e ;</l>
     <l n="144">Let greatness own her , and she 's mean no more ;</l>
     <l n="145">Her birth , her beauty , crowds and courts confess ;</l>
     <l n="146">Chaste matrons praise her , and grave bishops bless ;</l>
     <l n="147">In golden chains the willing world she draws ,</l>
     <l n="148">And hers the Gospel is , and hers the laws ,</l>
     <l n="149">Mounts the tribunal , lifts her scarlet head ,</l>
     <l n="150">And sees pale Virtue carted in her stead .</l>
     <l n="151">Lo ! at the wheels of her triumphal car</l>
     <l n="152">Old England 's genius , rough with many a scar ,</l>
     <l n="153">Dragged in the dust ! his arms hang idly round ,</l>
     <l n="154">His flag inverted trails along the ground !</l>
     <l n="155">Our youth , all liveried o'er with foreign gold ,</l>
     <l n="156">Before her dance : behind her crawl the old !</l>
     <l n="157">See thronging millions to the Pagod run ,</l>
     <l n="158">And offer country , parent , wife , or son ;</l>
     <l n="159">Hear her black trumpet through the land proclaim</l>
     <l n="160">That not to be corrupted is the shame .</l>
     <l n="161">In soldier , Churchman , patriot , man in power ,</l>
     <l n="162">‘ Tis avarice all , ambition is no more !</l>
     <l n="163">See , all our nobles begging to be slaves !</l>
     <l n="164">See , all our fools aspiring to be knaves !</l>
     <l n="165">The wit of cheats , the courage of a w *** e ,</l>
     <l n="166">Are what ten thousand envy and adore ;</l>
     <l n="167">All , all look up , with reverential awe ,</l>
     <l n="168">At crimes that ‘ scape , or triumph o'er the law ;</l>
     <l n="169">While truth , worth , wisdom , daily they decry —</l>
     <l n="170">“ Nothing is sacred now but villainy . ”</l>
     <l n="171">Yet may this verse ( if such a verse remain )</l>

    <head>DIALOGUE II .</head>
     <l n="1">Fr . ‘ Tis all a libel — Paxton ( sir ) will say . }</l>
     <l n="2">P. Not yet , my friend ! to-morrow ‘ faith it may }</l>
     <l n="3">And for that very cause I print to-day . }</l>
     <l n="4">How should I fret to mangle every line ,</l>
     <l n="5">In reverence to the sins of thirty-nine !</l>
     <l n="6">Vice with such giant strides comes on amain ,</l>
     <l n="7">Invention strives to be before in vain ;</l>
     <l n="8">Feign what I will , and paint it e'er so strong ,</l>
     <l n="9">Some rising genius sins up to my song .</l>
     <l n="10">F. Yet none but you by name the guilty lash ;</l>
     <l n="11">Even Guthry saves half Newgate by a dash .</l>
     <l n="12">Spare , then , the person , and expose the vice .</l>
     <l n="13">P. How , sir ? not damn the sharper , but the dice ?</l>
     <l n="14">Come on , then , satire ! general , unconfined ,</l>
     <l n="15">Spread thy broad wing , and souse on all the kind .</l>
     <l n="16">Ye statesmen , priests , of one religion all !</l>
     <l n="17">Ye tradesmen vile , in army , court , or hall ,</l>
     <l n="18">Ye reverend atheists —</l>
     <l n="19">F. Scandal ! name them ! who ?</l>
     <l n="20">P. Why that 's the thing you bid me not to do .</l>
     <l n="21">Who starved a sister , who forswore a debt ,</l>
     <l n="22">I never named ; the town 's inquiring yet .</l>
     <l n="23">The poisoning dame —</l>
     <l n="24">F. You mean —</l>
     <l n="25">P. I do n't .</l>
     <l n="26">F. You do !</l>
     <l n="27">P. See , now I keep the secret , and not you !</l>
     <l n="28">The bribing statesman —</l>
     <l n="29">F. Hold , too high you go .</l>
     <l n="30">P. The bribed elector —</l>
     <l n="31">F. There you stoop too low .</l>
     <l n="32">P. I fain would please you , if I knew with what ;</l>
     <l n="33">Tell me , which knave is lawful game , which not ?</l>
     <l n="34">Must great offenders , once escaped the Crown ,</l>
     <l n="35">Like royal harts , be never more run down ?</l>
     <l n="36">Admit your law to spare the knight requires ,</l>
     <l n="37">As beasts of nature may we hunt the squires ?</l>
     <l n="38">Suppose I censure — you know what I mean —</l>
     <l n="39">To save a bishop , may I name a dean ?</l>
     <l n="40">F. A dean , sir ? no : his fortune is not made ;</l>
     <l n="41">You hurt a man that 's rising in the trade .</l>
     <l n="42">P. If not the tradesman who set up to-day ,</l>
     <l n="43">Much less the ‘ prentice who to-morrow may .</l>
     <l n="44">Down , down , proud satire ! though a realm be spoiled ,</l>
     <l n="45">Arraign no mightier thief than wretched Wild ;</l>
     <l n="46">Or , if a court or country 's made a job ,</l>
     <l n="47">Go drench a pickpocket , and join the mob .</l>
     <l n="48">But , sir , I beg you ( for the love of vice ! )</l>
     <l n="49">The matter 's weighty , pray consider twice ;</l>
     <l n="50">Have you less pity for the needy cheat ,</l>
     <l n="51">The poor and friendless villain , than the great ?</l>
     <l n="52">Alas ! the small discredit of a bribe</l>
     <l n="53">Scarce hurts the lawyer , but undoes the scribe .</l>
     <l n="54">Then better , sure , it charity becomes</l>
     <l n="55">To tax directors , who ( thank God ! ) have plums ;</l>
     <l n="56">Still better , ministers ; or , if the thing</l>
     <l n="57">May pinch even there — why lay it on a king .</l>
     <l n="58">F. Stop ! stop !</l>
     <l n="59">P. Must satire , then , nor rise nor fall ?</l>
     <l n="60">Speak out , and bid me blame no rogues at all .</l>
     <l n="61">F. Yes , strike that Wild , I 'll justify the blow .</l>
     <l n="62">P. Strike ? why the man was hanged ten year ago :</l>
     <l n="63">Who now that obsolete example fears ?</l>
     <l n="64">Even Peter trembles only for his ears .</l>
     <l n="65">F. What ? always Peter ? Peter thinks you mad ;</l>
     <l n="66">You make men desperate if they once are bad :</l>
     <l n="67">Else might he take to virtue some years hence —</l>
     <l n="68">P. As S — - k , if he lives , will love the prince .</l>
     <l n="69">F. Strange spleen to S — - k !</l>
     <l n="70">P. Do I wrong the man ?</l>
     <l n="71">God knows , I praise a courtier where I can .</l>
     <l n="72">When I confess , there is who feels for fame ,</l>
     <l n="73">And melts to goodness , need I Scarb'row name ?</l>
     <l n="74">Please let me own , in Esher 's peaceful grove</l>
     <l n="75">( Where Kent and Nature vie for Pelham 's love ) ,</l>
     <l n="76">The scene , the master , opening to my view ,</l>
     <l n="77">I sit and dream I see my Craggs anew !</l>
     <l n="78">Even in a bishop I can spy desert ;</l>
     <l n="79">Secker is decent , Rundel has a heart ,</l>
     <l n="80">Manners with candour are to Benson given ,</l>
     <l n="81">To Berkeley , every virtue under Heaven .</l>
     <l n="82">But does the Court a worthy man remove ?</l>
     <l n="83">That instant , I declare , he has my love :</l>
     <l n="84">I shun his zenith , court his mild decline ;</l>
     <l n="85">Thus Somers once , and Halifax , were mine .</l>
     <l n="86">Oft , in the clear , still mirror of retreat ,</l>
     <l n="87">I studied Shrewsbury , the wise and great :</l>
     <l n="88">Carleton 's calm sense , and Stanhope 's noble flame ,</l>
     <l n="89">Compared , and knew their generous end the same ;</l>
     <l n="90">How pleasing Atterbury 's softer hour !</l>
     <l n="91">How shined the soul , unconquered in the tower !</l>
     <l n="92">How can I Pulteney , Chesterfield forget ,</l>
     <l n="93">While Roman spirit charms , and attic wit :</l>
     <l n="94">Argyll , the state 's whole thunder born to wield ,</l>
     <l n="95">And shake alike the senate and the field :</l>
     <l n="96">Or Wyndham , just to freedom and the throne ,</l>
     <l n="97">The master of our passions , and his own ?</l>
     <l n="98">Names , which I long have loved , nor loved in vain ,</l>
     <l n="99">Ranked with their friends , not numbered with their train ;</l>
     <l n="100">And if yet higher the proud list should end ,</l>
     <l n="101">Still let me say : No follower , but a friend .</l>
     <l n="102">Yet think not , friendship only prompts my lays ;</l>
     <l n="103">I follow Virtue : where she shines , I praise :</l>
     <l n="104">Point she to priest or elder , Whig or Tory ,</l>
     <l n="105">Or round a Quaker 's beaver cast a glory .</l>
     <l n="106">I never ( to my sorrow , I declare )</l>
     <l n="107">Dined with the Man of Ross , or my Lord Mayor .</l>
     <l n="108">Some in their choice of friends ( nay , look not grave )</l>
     <l n="109">Have still a secret bias to a knave :</l>
     <l n="110">To find an honest man I beat about ,</l>
     <l n="111">And love him , court him , praise him , in or out .</l>
     <l n="112">F. Then why so few commended ?</l>
     <l n="113">P. Not so fierce !</l>
     <l n="114">Find you the virtue , and I 'll find the verse .</l>
     <l n="115">But random praise — the task can ne'er be done ;</l>
     <l n="116">Each mother asks it for her booby son ,</l>
     <l n="117">Each widow asks it for the best of men ,</l>
     <l n="118">For him she weeps , and him she weds again .</l>
     <l n="119">Praise cannot stoop , like satire , to the ground ;</l>
     <l n="120">The number may be hanged , but not be crowned .</l>
     <l n="121">Enough for half the greatest of these days</l>
     <l n="122">To ‘ scape my censure , not expect my praise .</l>
     <l n="123">And they not rich ? what more can they pretend ?</l>
     <l n="124">Dare they to hope a poet for their friend ?</l>
     <l n="125">What Richelieu wanted , Louis scarce could gain ,</l>
     <l n="126">And what young Ammon wished , but wished in vain .</l>
     <l n="127">No power the muse 's friendship can command ;</l>
     <l n="128">No power when virtue claims it , can withstand :</l>
     <l n="129">To Cato , Virgil paid one honest line ;</l>
     <l n="130">O let my country 's friends illumine mine !</l>
     <l n="131">What are you thinking ?</l>
     <l n="132">F. ‘ Faith , the thought 's no sin :</l>
     <l n="133">I think your friends are out , and would be in .</l>
     <l n="134">P. If merely to come in , sir , they go out ,</l>
     <l n="135">The way they take is strangely round about .</l>
     <l n="136">F. They too may be corrupted , you 'll allow ?</l>
     <l n="137">P. I only call those knaves who are so now .</l>
     <l n="138">Is that too little ? Come , then , I 'll comply —</l>
     <l n="139">Spirit of Arnall ! aid me while I lie .</l>
     <l n="140">Cobham 's a coward , Polwarth is a slave ,</l>
     <l n="141">And Littelton a dark , designing knave ,</l>
     <l n="142">St. John has ever been a wealthy fool —</l>
     <l n="143">But let me add , Sir Robert 's mighty dull ,</l>
     <l n="144">Has never made a friend in private life ,</l>
     <l n="145">And was , besides , a tyrant to his wife .</l>
     <l n="146">But pray , when others praise him , do I blame ?</l>
     <l n="147">Call Verres , Wolsey , any odious name ?</l>
     <l n="148">Why rail they , then , if but a wreath of mine ,</l>
     <l n="149">Oh , all-accomplished St. John ! deck thy shrine ?</l>
     <l n="150">What ? shall each spur-galled hackney of the day ,</l>
     <l n="151">When Paxton gives him double pots and pay ,</l>
     <l n="152">Or each new-pensioned sycophant , pretend</l>
     <l n="153">To break my windows , if I treat a friend ?</l>
     <l n="154">Then wisely plead , to me they meant no hurt ,</l>
     <l n="155">But ‘ twas my guest at whom they threw the dirt ?</l>
     <l n="156">Sure , if I spare the minister , no rules</l>
     <l n="157">Of honour bind me , not to maul his tools ;</l>
     <l n="158">Some , if they cannot cut , it may be said</l>
     <l n="159">His saws are toothless , and his hatchet 's lead .</l>
     <l n="160">If angered Turenne , once upon a day ,</l>
     <l n="161">To see a footman kicked that took his pay :</l>
     <l n="162">But when he heard the affront the fellow gave ,</l>
     <l n="163">Knew one a man of honour , one a knave ;</l>
     <l n="164">The prudent general turned it to a jest ,</l>
     <l n="165">And begged , he 'd take the pains to kick the rest :</l>
     <l n="166">Which not at present having time to do —</l>
     <l n="167">F. Hold , sir ! for God 's sake where 's the affront to you ?</l>
     <l n="168">Against your worship when had S — - k writ ?</l>
     <l n="169">Or P — ge poured forth the torrent of his wit ?</l>
     <l n="170">Or grant the bard whose distich all commend</l>
     <l n="171">( In power a servant , out of power a friend )</l>
     <l n="172">To W — - le guilty of some venial sin ;</l>
     <l n="173">What 's that to you who ne'er was out nor in ?</l>
     <l n="174">The priest whose flattery be-dropt the Crown ,</l>
     <l n="175">How hurt he you ? he only stained the gown .</l>
     <l n="176">And how did , pray , the florid youth offend ,</l>
     <l n="177">Whose speech you took , and gave it to a friend ?</l>
     <l n="178">P. ‘ Faith , it imports not much from whom it came ; }</l>
     <l n="179">Whoever borrowed , could not be to blame , }</l>
     <l n="180">Since the whole house did afterwards the same . }</l>
     <l n="181">Let courtly wits to wits afford supply ,</l>
     <l n="182">As hog to hog in huts of Westphaly ;</l>
     <l n="183">If one , through Nature 's bounty , or his Lord 's ,</l>
     <l n="184">Has what the frugal , dirty soil affords ,</l>
     <l n="185">From him the next receives it , thick or thin ,</l>
     <l n="186">As pure a mess almost as it came in ;</l>
     <l n="187">The blessed benefit , not there confined ,</l>
     <l n="188">Drops to the third , who nuzzles close behind ;</l>
     <l n="189">From tail to mouth , they feed and they carouse :</l>
     <l n="190">The last full fairly gives it to the House .</l>
     <l n="191">F. This filthy simile , this beastly line ,</l>
     <l n="192">Quite turns my stomach —</l>
     <l n="193">P. So does flattery mine ;</l>
     <l n="194">And all your courtly civet-cats can vent ,</l>
     <l n="195">Perfume to you , to me is excrement .</l>
     <l n="196">But hear me further — Japhet , ‘ tis agreed ,</l>
     <l n="197">Writ not , and Chartres scarce could write or read ,</l>
     <l n="198">In all the courts of Pindus guiltless quite ;</l>
     <l n="199">But pens can forge , my friend , that cannot write ;</l>
     <l n="200">And must no egg in Japhet 's face be thrown</l>
     <l n="201">Because the deed he forged was not my own ?</l>
     <l n="202">Must never patriot , then , declaim at gin ,</l>
     <l n="203">Unless , good man ! he has been fairly in ?</l>
     <l n="204">No zealous pastor blame a failing spouse</l>
     <l n="205">Without a staring reason on his brows ?</l>
     <l n="206">And each blasphemer quite escape the rod</l>
     <l n="207">Because the insult 's not on man , but God ?</l>
     <l n="208">Ask you what provocation I have had ?</l>
     <l n="209">The strong antipathy of good to bad .</l>
     <l n="210">When truth or virtue an affront endures ,</l>
     <l n="211">The affront is mine , my friend , and should be yours .</l>
     <l n="212">Mine , as a foe professed to false pretence ,</l>
     <l n="213">Who think a coxcomb 's honour like his sense ;</l>
     <l n="214">Mine , as a friend to every worthy mind</l>
     <l n="215">And mine as man , who feel for all mankind .</l>
     <l n="216">F. You 're strangely proud .</l>
     <l n="217">P. So proud , I am no slave : }</l>
     <l n="218">So impudent I own myself no knave : }</l>
     <l n="219">So odd , my country 's ruin makes me grave . }</l>
     <l n="220">Yes , I am proud ; I must be proud to see</l>
     <l n="221">Men not afraid of God afraid of me :</l>
     <l n="222">Safe from the Bar , the Pulpit , and the Throne ,</l>
     <l n="223">Yet touched and shamed by ridicule alone .</l>
     <l n="224">O , sacred weapon left for truth 's defence ,</l>
     <l n="225">Sole dread of folly , vice , and insolence !</l>
     <l n="226">To all but heaven-directed hands denied</l>
     <l n="227">The muse may give thee , but the gods must guide :</l>
     <l n="228">Reverent I touch thee ! but with honest zeal ,</l>
     <l n="229">To rouse the watchmen of the public weal ;</l>
     <l n="230">To virtue 's work provoke the tardy hall ,</l>
     <l n="231">And goad the prelate slumbering in his stall .</l>
     <l n="232">Ye tinsel insects whom a Court maintains</l>
     <l n="233">That counts your beauties only by your stains ,</l>
     <l n="234">Spin all your cobwebs o'er the eye of day !</l>
     <l n="235">The muse 's wing shall brush you all away ;</l>
     <l n="236">All his Grace preaches , all his Lordship sings ,</l>
     <l n="237">All that makes saints of queens , and gods of kings .</l>
     <l n="238">All , all but truth , drops dead-born from the press ,</l>
     <l n="239">Like the last gazette or the last address .</l>
     <l n="240">When black ambition stains a public cause ,</l>
     <l n="241">A monarch 's sword when mad vain-glory draws ,</l>
     <l n="242">Not Waller 's wreath can hide the nation 's scar</l>
     <l n="243">Nor Boileau turn the feather to a star .</l>
     <l n="244">Not so , when diademed with rays divine ,</l>
     <l n="245">Touched with the flame that breaks from Virtue 's shrine ,</l>
     <l n="246">Her priestless muse forbids the good to die ,</l>
     <l n="247">And opes the temple of Eternity .</l>
     <l n="248">There other trophies deck the truly brave ,</l>
     <l n="249">Than such as Anstis casts into the grave ;</l>
     <l n="250">Far other stars than * and * * wear ,</l>
     <l n="251">And may descend to Mordington from Stair :</l>
     <l n="252">( Such as on Hough 's unsullied mitre shine ,</l>
     <l n="253">Or beam , good Digby , from a heart like thine ) .</l>
     <l n="254">Let envy howl , while heaven 's whole chorus sings ,</l>
     <l n="255">And bark at honour not conferred by kings :</l>
     <l n="256">Let flattery sickening see the incense rise</l>
     <l n="257">Sweet to the world , and grateful to the skies :</l>
     <l n="258">Truth guards the poet , sanctifies the line ,</l>
     <l n="259">And makes immortal , verse as mean as mine .</l>
     <l n="260">Yes , the last pen for freedom let me draw ,</l>
