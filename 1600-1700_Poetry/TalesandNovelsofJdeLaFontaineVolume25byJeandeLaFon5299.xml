    <head>THE DRESS-MAKER</head>
     <l n="1">A CLOISTERED nun had a lover</l>
     <l n="2">Dwelling in the neighb'ring town ;</l>
     <l n="3">Both racked their brains to discover</l>
     <l n="4">How they best their love might crown .</l>
     <l n="5">The swain to pass the convent-door !—</l>
     <l n="6">No easy matter !— Thus they swore ,</l>
     <l n="7">And wished it light .— I ne'er knew a nun</l>
     <l n="8">In such a pass to be outdone :—</l>
     <l n="9">In woman 's clothes the youth must dress ,</l>
     <l n="10">And gain admission . I confess</l>
     <l n="11">The ruse has oft been tried before ,</l>
     <l n="12">But it succeeded as of yore .</l>
     <l n="13">Together in a close barred cell</l>
     <l n="14">The lovers were , and sewed all day ,</l>
     <l n="15">Nor heeded how time flew away .—</l>
     <l n="16">“ What 's that I hear ? Refection bell !</l>
     <l n="17">“ ‘ Tis time to part . Adieu !— Farewell !—</l>
     <l n="18">“ How 's this ? ” exclaimed the abbess , “ why</l>
     <l n="19">“ The last at table ? ” — “ Madam , I</l>
     <l n="20">“ Have had my dress-maker . ” — “ The rent</l>
     <l n="21">“ On which you 've both been so intent</l>
     <l n="22">“ Is hard to stop , for the whole day</l>
     <l n="23">“ To sew and mend , you made her stay ;</l>
     <l n="24">“ Much work indeed you 've had to do !</l>
     <l n="25">“ — Madam , ‘ t would last the whole night through ,</l>
     <l n="26">“ When in our task we find enjoyment</l>
     <l n="27">“ There is no end of the employment . ”</l>

    <head>THE GASCON</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I AM always inclined to suspect</l>
     <l n="2">The best story under the sun</l>
     <l n="3">As soon as by chance I detect</l>
     <l n="4">That teller and hero are one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">We 're all of us prone to conceit ,</l>
     <l n="6">And like to proclaim our own glory ,</l>
     <l n="7">But our purpose we 're apt to defeat</l>
     <l n="8">As actors in chief of our story .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">To prove the truth of what I state</l>
     <l n="10">Let me an anecdote relate :</l>
     <l n="11">A Gascon with his comrade sat</l>
     <l n="12">At tavern drinking . This and that</l>
     <l n="13">He vaunted with assertion pat .</l>
     <l n="14">From gasconade to gasconade</l>
     <l n="15">Passed to the conquests he had made</l>
     <l n="16">In love . A buxom country maid ,</l>
     <l n="17">Who served the wine , with due attention</l>
     <l n="18">Lent patient ear to each invention ,</l>
     <l n="19">And pressed her hands against her side</l>
     <l n="20">Her bursting merriment to hide .</l>
     <l n="21">To hear our Gascon talk , no Sue</l>
     <l n="22">Nor Poll in town but that he knew ;</l>
     <l n="23">With each he 'd passed a blissful night</l>
     <l n="24">More to their own than his delight .</l>
     <l n="25">This one he loved for she was fair ,</l>
     <l n="26">That for her glossy ebon hair .</l>
     <l n="27">One miss , to tame his cruel rigour ,</l>
     <l n="28">Had brought him gifts .— She owned his vigour</l>
     <l n="29">In short it wanted but his gaze</l>
     <l n="30">To set each trembling heart ablaze .</l>
     <l n="31">His strength surpassed his luck ,— the test —</l>
     <l n="32">In one short night ten times he 'd blessed</l>
     <l n="33">A dame who gratefully expressed</l>
     <l n="34">Her thanks with corresponding zest .</l>
     <l n="35">At this the maid burst forth , “ What more ?</l>
     <l n="36">“ I never heard such lies before !</l>
     <l n="37">“ Content were I if at that sport</l>
     <l n="38">“ I had what that poor dame was short . ”</l>

    <head>THE PITCHER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE simple Jane was sent to bring</l>
     <l n="2">Fresh water from the neighb'ring spring ;</l>
     <l n="3">The matter pressed , no time to waste ,</l>
     <l n="4">Jane took her jug , and ran in haste</l>
     <l n="5">The well to reach , but in her flurry</l>
     <l n="6">( The more the speed the worse the hurry ) ,</l>
     <l n="7">Tripped on a rolling stone , and broke</l>
     <l n="8">Her precious pitcher ,— ah ! no joke !</l>
     <l n="9">Nay , grave mishap ! ‘ twere better far</l>
     <l n="10">To break her neck than such a jar !</l>
     <l n="11">Her dame would beat and soundly rate her ,</l>
     <l n="12">No way could Jane propitiate her .</l>
     <l n="13">Without a sou new jug to buy !</l>
     <l n="14">‘ Twere better far for her to die !</l>
     <l n="15">O'erwhelmed by grief and cruel fears</l>
     <l n="16">Unhappy Jane burst into tears</l>
     <l n="17">“ I can n't go home without the delf , ”</l>
     <l n="18">Sobbed Jane , “ I 'd rather kill myself ;</l>
     <l n="19">“ So here am I resolved to die . ”</l>
     <l n="20">A friendly neighbour passing by</l>
     <l n="21">O'erheard our damsel 's lamentation ;</l>
     <l n="22">And kindly offered consolation :</l>
     <l n="23">“ If death , sweet maiden , be thy bent ,</l>
     <l n="24">“ I 'll aid thee in thy sad intent . ”</l>
     <l n="25">Throwing her down , he drew his dirk ,</l>
     <l n="26">And plunged it in the maid ,— a work</l>
     <l n="27">You 'll say was cruel ,— not so Jane ,</l>
     <l n="28">Who even seemed to like the pain ,</l>
     <l n="29">And hoped to be thus stabbed again .</l>
     <l n="30">Amid the weary world 's alarms ,</l>
     <l n="31">For some e'en death will have its charms ;</l>
     <l n="32">“ If this , my friend , is how you kill ,</l>
     <l n="33">“ Of breaking jugs I 'll have my fill ! ”</l>

     <l n="34">TO PROMISE IS ONE THING</l>
     <l n="35">TO KEEP IT , ANOTHER</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="36">JOHN courts Perrette ; but all in vain ;</l>
     <l n="37">Love 's sweetest oaths , and tears , and sighs</l>
     <l n="38">All potent spells her heart to gain</l>
     <l n="39">The ardent lover vainly tries :</l>
     <l n="40">Fruitless his arts to make her waver ,</l>
     <l n="41">She will not grant the smallest favour :</l>
     <l n="42">A ruse our youth resolved to try</l>
     <l n="43">The cruel air to mollify :—</l>
     <l n="44">Holding his fingers ten outspread</l>
     <l n="45">To Perrette 's gaze , and with no dread</l>
     <l n="46">“ So often , ” said he , “ can I prove ,</l>
     <l n="47">“ My sweet Perrette , how warm my love . ”</l>
     <l n="48">When lover 's last avowals fail</l>
     <l n="49">To melt the maiden 's coy suspicions</l>
     <l n="50">A lover 's sign will oft prevail</l>
     <l n="51">To win the way to soft concessions :</l>
     <l n="52">Half won she takes the tempting bait ;</l>
     <l n="53">Smiles on him , draws her lover nearer ,</l>
     <l n="54">With heart no longer obdurate</l>
     <l n="55">She teaches him no more to fear her-</l>
     <l n="56">A pinch ,— a kiss ,— a kindling eye ,—</l>
     <l n="57">Her melting glances ,— nothing said .—</l>
     <l n="58">John ceases not his suit to ply</l>
     <l n="59">Till his first finger 's debt is paid .</l>
     <l n="60">A second , third and fourth he gains ,</l>
     <l n="61">Takes breath , and e'en a fifth maintains .</l>
     <l n="62">But who could long such contest wage ?</l>
     <l n="63">Not I , although of fitting age ,</l>
     <l n="64">Nor John himself , for here he stopped ,</l>
     <l n="65">And further effort sudden dropped .</l>
     <l n="66">Perrette , whose appetite increased</l>
     <l n="67">just as her lover 's vigour ceased ,</l>
     <l n="68">In her fond reckoning defeated ,</l>
     <l n="69">Considered she was greatly cheated —</l>
     <l n="70">If duty , well discharged , such blame</l>
     <l n="71">Deserve ; for many a highborn dame</l>
     <l n="72">Would be content with such deceit .</l>
     <l n="73">But Perrette , as already told ,</l>
     <l n="74">Out of her count , began to scold</l>
     <l n="75">And call poor John an arrant cheat</l>
     <l n="76">For promising and not performing .</l>
     <l n="77">John calmly listened to her storming ,</l>
     <l n="78">And well content with work well done ,</l>
     <l n="79">Thinking his laurels fairly won ,</l>
     <l n="80">Cooly replied , on taking leave :</l>
     <l n="81">“ No cause I see to fume and grieve ;</l>
     <l n="82">“ Or for such trifle to dispute ;</l>
     <l n="83">“ To promise and to execute</l>
     <l n="84">“ Are not the same , be it confessed ,</l>
     <l n="85">“ Suffice it to have done one 's best ;</l>
     <l n="86">“ With time I 'll yet discharge what 's due ;</l>
     <l n="87">“ Meanwhile , my sweet Perrette , adieu ! ”</l>

    <head>THE NIGHTINGALE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NO easy matter ‘ tis to hold ,</l>
     <l n="2">Against its owner 's will , the fleece</l>
     <l n="3">Who troubled by the itching smart</l>
     <l n="4">Of Cupid 's irritating dart ,</l>
     <l n="5">Eager awaits some Jason bold</l>
     <l n="6">To grant release .</l>
     <l n="7">E'en dragon huge , or flaming steer ,</l>
     <l n="8">When Jason 's loved will cause no fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Duennas , grating , bolt and lock ,</l>
     <l n="10">All obstacles can naught avail ;</l>
     <l n="11">Constraint is but a stumbling block ;</l>
     <l n="12">For youthful ardour must prevail .</l>
     <l n="13">Girls are precocious nowadays ,</l>
     <l n="14">Look at the men with ardent gaze ,</l>
     <l n="15">And longings ’ an infinity ;</l>
     <l n="16">Trim misses but just in their teens</l>
     <l n="17">By day and night devise the means</l>
     <l n="18">To dull with subtlety to sleep</l>
     <l n="19">The Argus vainly set to keep</l>
     <l n="20">In safety their virginity .</l>
     <l n="21">Sighs , smiles , false tears , they 'll fain employ</l>
     <l n="22">An artless lover to decoy .</l>
     <l n="23">I 'll say no more , but leave to you ,</l>
     <l n="24">Friend reader , to pronounce if true</l>
     <l n="25">What I 've asserted when you have heard</l>
     <l n="26">How artful Kitty , caged her bird .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">IN a small town in Italy ,</l>
     <l n="28">The name of which I do not know ,</l>
     <l n="29">Young Kitty dwelt , gay , pretty , free ,</l>
     <l n="30">Varambon 's child .— Boccacio</l>
     <l n="31">Omits her mother 's name , which not</l>
     <l n="32">To you or me imports a jot .</l>
     <l n="33">At fourteen years our Kitty 's charms</l>
     <l n="34">Were all that could be wished — plump arms ,</l>
     <l n="35">A swelling bosom ; on her cheeks</l>
     <l n="36">Roses ’ and lilies ’ mingled streaks ,</l>
     <l n="37">A sparkling eye — all these , you know ,</l>
     <l n="38">Speak well for what is found below .</l>
     <l n="39">With such advantages as these</l>
     <l n="40">No virgin sure could fail to please ,</l>
     <l n="41">Or lack a lover ; nor did Kate ;</l>
     <l n="42">But little time she had to wait ;</l>
     <l n="43">One soon appeared to seal her fate .</l>
     <l n="44">Young Richard saw her , loved her , wooed her —</l>
     <l n="45">What swain I ask could have withstood her ?</l>
     <l n="46">Soft words , caresses , tender glances ,</l>
     <l n="47">The battery of love 's advances ,</l>
     <l n="48">Soon lit up in the maiden 's breast</l>
     <l n="49">The flame which his own heart possessed ,</l>
     <l n="50">Soon growing to a burning fire</l>
     <l n="51">Of love and mutual desire .</l>
     <l n="52">Desire for what ? My reader knows ,</l>
     <l n="53">Or if he does not may suppose ,</l>
     <l n="54">And not be very wond'rous wise .</l>
     <l n="55">When youthful lovers mingle sighs ,</l>
     <l n="56">Believe me , friend , I am not wrong ,</l>
     <l n="57">For one thing only do they long .</l>
     <l n="58">One check deferred our lover 's bliss ,</l>
     <l n="59">A thing quite natural , ‘ twas this :</l>
     <l n="60">The mother loved so well her child</l>
     <l n="61">That , fearful she might be beguiled ,</l>
     <l n="62">She would not let her out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="63">A single minute , day or night .</l>
     <l n="64">At mother 's apron string all day</l>
     <l n="65">Kate whiled the weary hours away ,</l>
     <l n="66">And shared her bed all night . Such love</l>
     <l n="67">In parents we must all approve ,</l>
     <l n="68">Though Catherine , I must confess ,</l>
     <l n="69">In place of so much tenderness</l>
     <l n="70">More liberty would have preferred .</l>
     <l n="71">To little girls maternal care</l>
     <l n="72">In such excess is right and fair ,</l>
     <l n="73">But for a lass of fourteen years ,</l>
     <l n="74">For whom one need have no such fears ,</l>
     <l n="75">Solicitude is quite absurd ,</l>
     <l n="76">And only bores her . Kitty could</l>
     <l n="77">No moment steal , do what she would ,</l>
     <l n="78">To see her Richard . Sorely vexed</l>
     <l n="79">She was , and he still more perplexed .</l>
     <l n="80">In spite of all he might devise</l>
     <l n="81">A squeeze , a kiss , quick talk of eyes</l>
     <l n="82">Was all he could obtain , no more .</l>
     <l n="83">Bread butterless , a sanded floor ,</l>
     <l n="84">It seemed no better . Joy like this</l>
     <l n="85">Could not suffice , more sterling bliss</l>
     <l n="86">Our lovers wished , nor would stop short</l>
     <l n="87">Till they 'd obtained the thing they sought .</l>
     <l n="88">And thus it came about . One day</l>
     <l n="89">By chance they met , alone , away</l>
     <l n="90">From jealous parents . “ What 's the use ; ”</l>
     <l n="91">Said Richard , “ of all our affection ?</l>
     <l n="92">“ Of love it is a rank abuse ,</l>
     <l n="93">“ And yields me nothing but dejection</l>
     <l n="94">“ I see you without seeing you ,</l>
     <l n="95">“ Must always look another way ,</l>
     <l n="96">“ And if we meet I dare not stay ,</l>
     <l n="97">“ Must ev'ry inclination smother .</l>
     <l n="98">“ I can n't believe your love is true ;</l>
     <l n="99">“ I 'll never own you really kind</l>
     <l n="100">“ Unless some certain means you find</l>
     <l n="101">“ For us to meet without your mother . ”</l>
     <l n="102">Kate answered : “ Were it not too plain</l>
     <l n="103">“ How warm my love , another strain</l>
     <l n="104">“ I would employ . In converse vain</l>
     <l n="105">“ Let us not waste our moments few ;</l>
     <l n="106">“ But think what it were best to do . ”</l>
     <l n="107">“ If you will please me , ” Robert said ,</l>
     <l n="108">“ You must contrive to change your bed ,</l>
     <l n="109">“ And have it placed — well , let me see —</l>
     <l n="110">“ Moved to the outer gallery ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ Where you will be alone and free .</l>
     <l n="112">“ We there can meet and chat at leisure</l>
     <l n="113">“ While others sleep , nor need we fear ,</l>
     <l n="114">“ Of merry tales I have a treasure</l>
     <l n="115">“ To tell , but cannot tell them here . ”</l>
     <l n="116">Kate smiled at this for she knew well</l>
     <l n="117">What sort of tales he had to tell ;</l>
     <l n="118">But promised she would do her best</l>
     <l n="119">And soon accomplish his request .</l>
     <l n="120">It was not easy , you 'll admit ,</l>
     <l n="121">But love lends foolish maidens wit ;</l>
     <l n="122">And this is how she managed it .</l>
     <l n="123">The whole night long she kept awake ,</l>
     <l n="124">Snored , sighed and kicked , as one possessed ,</l>
     <l n="125">That parents both could get not rest ,</l>
     <l n="126">So much she made the settle shake .</l>
     <l n="127">This is not strange . A longing girl ,</l>
     <l n="128">With thoughts of sweetheart in her head ,</l>
     <l n="129">In bed all night will sleepless twirl .</l>
     <l n="130">A flea is in her ear , ‘ tis said .</l>
     <l n="131">The morning broke . Of fleas and heat</l>
     <l n="132">Kitty complained . “ Let me entreat ,</l>
     <l n="133">“ O mother , I may put my bed</l>
     <l n="134">“ Out in the gallery , ” she said ,</l>
     <l n="135">“ ‘ Tis cooler there , and Philomel</l>
     <l n="136">“ Who warbles in the neigh'bring dell</l>
     <l n="137">“ Will solace me . ” Ready consent</l>
     <l n="138">The simple mother gave , and went</l>
     <l n="139">To seek her spouse . “ Our Kate , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="140">“ Will change her bed that she may hear</l>
     <l n="141">“ The nightingale , and sleep more cool . ”</l>
     <l n="142">“ Wife , ” said the good man , “ You 're a fool ,</l>
     <l n="143">“ And Kate too with her nightingale ;</l>
     <l n="144">“ Do n't tell me such a foolish tale .</l>
     <l n="145">“ She must remain . No doubt to-night</l>
     <l n="146">“ Will fresher be . I sleep all right</l>
     <l n="147">“ In spite of heat , and so can she .</l>
     <l n="148">“ Is she more delicate than me ? ”</l>
     <l n="149">Incensed was Kate by this denial</l>
     <l n="150">After so promising a trial ,</l>
     <l n="151">Nor would be beat , but firmly swore</l>
     <l n="152">To give more trouble than before .</l>
     <l n="153">That night again no wink she slept</l>
     <l n="154">But groaned and fretted , sighed and wept ,</l>
     <l n="155">Upon her couch so tossed and turned ,</l>
     <l n="156">The anxious mother quite concerned</l>
     <l n="157">Again her husband sought . “ Our Kate</l>
     <l n="158">“ To me seems greatly changed of late .</l>
     <l n="159">“ You are unkind , ” she said to him ,</l>
     <l n="160">“ To thwart her simple , girlish whim .</l>
     <l n="161">“ Why may she not her bed exchange ,</l>
     <l n="162">“ In naught will it the house derange ?</l>
     <l n="163">“ Placed in the passage she 's as near</l>
     <l n="164">“ To us as were she lying here .</l>
     <l n="165">“ You do not love your child , and will</l>
     <l n="166">“ With your unkindness make her ill . ”</l>
     <l n="167">“ Pray cease , ” the husband cried , “ to scold</l>
     <l n="168">“ And take your whim . I ne'er could hold</l>
     <l n="169">“ My own against a screaming wife ;</l>
     <l n="170">“ You 'll drive me mad , upon my life .</l>
     <l n="171">“ Her belly-full our Kate may get</l>
     <l n="172">“ Of nightingale or of linnet . ”</l>
     <l n="173">The thing was settled . Kate obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="174">And in a trice her bed was made ,</l>
     <l n="175">And lover signalled . Who shall say</l>
     <l n="176">How long to both appeared that day ,</l>
     <l n="177">That tedious day ! But night arrived</l>
     <l n="178">And Richard too ; he had contrived</l>
     <l n="179">By ladder , and a servant 's aid ,</l>
     <l n="180">To reach the chamber of the maid .</l>
     <l n="181">To tell how often they embraced ,</l>
     <l n="182">How changed in form their tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="183">Would lead to nothing but a waste</l>
     <l n="184">Of time , my readers will confess .</l>
     <l n="185">The longest , most abstruse discourse</l>
     <l n="186">Would lack precision , want the force</l>
     <l n="187">Their youthful ardour to portray .</l>
     <l n="188">To understand there 's but one way —</l>
     <l n="189">Experience . The nightingale</l>
     <l n="190">Sang all night long his pleasing tale ,</l>
     <l n="191">And though he made but little noise ,</l>
     <l n="192">The lass was satisfied . Her joys</l>
     <l n="193">So exquisite that she averred</l>
     <l n="194">The other nightingale , the bird</l>
     <l n="195">Who warbles to the woods his bliss ,</l>
     <l n="196">Was but an ass compared with this .</l>
     <l n="197">But nature could not long maintain</l>
     <l n="198">Of efforts such as these the strain ;</l>
     <l n="199">Their forces spent , the lovers twain</l>
     <l n="200">In fond embrace fell fast asleep</l>
     <l n="201">Just as the dawn began to peep :</l>
     <l n="202">The father as he left his bed</l>
     <l n="203">By curiosity was led</l>
     <l n="204">To learn if Kitty soundly slept ,</l>
     <l n="205">And softly to the passage crept .</l>
     <l n="206">“ I 'll see the influence , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="207">“ Of nightingale and change of bed . ”</l>
     <l n="208">With bated breath , upon tip toes ,</l>
     <l n="209">Close to the couch he cautious goes</l>
     <l n="210">Where Kitty lay in calm repose .</l>
     <l n="211">Excessive heat had made all clothes</l>
     <l n="212">Unbearable . The sleeping pair</l>
     <l n="213">Had cast them off , and lay as bare</l>
     <l n="214">As our first happy parents were</l>
     <l n="215">In Paradise . But in the place</l>
     <l n="216">Of apple , in her willing hand</l>
     <l n="217">Kate firmly grasp the magic wand</l>
     <l n="218">Which served to found the human race ,</l>
     <l n="219">The which to name were a disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="220">Though dames the most refined employ it ;</l>
     <l n="221">Desire it , and much enjoy it ,</l>
     <l n="222">If good Catullus tells us true .</l>
     <l n="223">The father scarce believed his view ,</l>
     <l n="224">But keeping in his bosom pent</l>
     <l n="225">His anger , to his wife he went ,</l>
     <l n="226">And said , “ Get up , and come with me .</l>
     <l n="227">“ At present I can plainly see</l>
     <l n="228">“ Why Kate had such anxiety</l>
     <l n="229">“ To hear the nightingale , for she</l>
     <l n="230">“ To catch the bird so well has planned</l>
     <l n="231">“ That now she holds him in her hand . ”</l>
     <l n="232">The mother almost wept for glee .</l>
     <l n="233">“ A nightingale , oh ! let me see .</l>
     <l n="234">“ How large is he , and can he sing ,</l>
     <l n="235">“ And will he breed , the pretty thing ?</l>
     <l n="236">“ How did she catch him , clever child ? ”</l>
     <l n="237">Despite his grief the good man smiled .</l>
     <l n="238">“ Much more than you expect you 'll see .</l>
     <l n="239">“ But hold your tongue , and come with me ;</l>
     <l n="240">“ For if your chattering is heard ,</l>
     <l n="241">“ Away will fly the timid bird ;</l>
     <l n="242">“ And you will spoil our daughter 's game . ”</l>
     <l n="243">Who was surprised ? It was the dame .</l>
     <l n="244">Her anger burst into a flame</l>
     <l n="245">As she the nightingale espied</l>
     <l n="246">Which Kitty held ; she could have cried ,</l>
     <l n="247">And scolded , called her nasty slut ,</l>
     <l n="248">And brazen hussey , bitch , and — but</l>
     <l n="249">Her husband stopped her . “ What 's the use</l>
     <l n="250">“ Of all your scolding and abuse ?</l>
     <l n="251">“ The mischief 's done , in vain may you</l>
     <l n="252">“ From now till doomsday fret and stew ,</l>
     <l n="253">“ Misfortune done you can n't undo ,</l>
     <l n="254">“ But something may be done to mend :</l>
     <l n="255">“ For notary this instant send ,</l>
     <l n="256">“ Bid holy priest and mayor attend .</l>
     <l n="257">“ For their good offices I wait</l>
     <l n="258">“ To set this nasty matter straight . ”</l>
     <l n="259">As he discoursed , Richard awoke ,</l>
     <l n="260">And seeing that the sun had broke ,</l>
     <l n="261">These troubled words to Kitty spoke</l>
     <l n="262">“ Alas , my love , ‘ tis broad day light ,</l>
     <l n="263">“ How can I now effect my flight ? ”</l>
     <l n="264">“ All will go well , ” rejoined the sire ,</l>
     <l n="265">“ I will not grumble , my just ire</l>
     <l n="266">“ Were useless here ; you have committed</l>
     <l n="267">“ A wrong of which to be acquitted ,</l>
     <l n="268">“ Richard , there is one only way ,</l>
     <l n="269">“ My child you wed without delay .</l>
     <l n="270">“ She 's well brought up , young , full of health</l>
     <l n="271">“ If fortune has not granted wealth ,</l>
     <l n="272">“ Her beauty you do not deny ,</l>
     <l n="273">“ So wed her , or prepare to die . ”</l>
     <l n="274">To hesitate in such a case</l>
     <l n="275">Would surely have been out of place</l>
     <l n="276">The girl he loved to take to wife ,</l>
     <l n="277">Or in his prime to lose his life ,</l>
     <l n="278">The point in truth needs no debate ,</l>
     <l n="279">Nor did our Richard hesitate .</l>
     <l n="280">Besides , the most supreme delight</l>
     <l n="281">Of life he 'd tasted one short night ,</l>
     <l n="282">But one , in lovely Kitty 's arms ;</l>
     <l n="283">Could he so soon resign her charms !</l>
     <l n="284">While Richard , pleased with his escape</l>
     <l n="285">From what he feared an awkward scrape ,</l>
     <l n="286">Was dreaming of his happy choice ,</l>
     <l n="287">Our Kitty , by her father 's voice</l>
     <l n="288">Awakened , from her hand let go</l>
     <l n="289">The cause of all her joy and woe ,</l>
     <l n="290">And round her naked beauties wound</l>
     <l n="291">The sheet picked up from off the ground :</l>
     <l n="292">Meanwhile the notary appears</l>
     <l n="293">To put an end to all their fears .</l>
     <l n="294">They wrote , they signed , the sealed — and thus</l>
     <l n="295">The wedding ended free from fuss .</l>
     <l n="296">They left the happy couple there .</l>
     <l n="297">His satisfaction to declare ,</l>
     <l n="298">Thus spoke their father to the pair :</l>
     <l n="299">“ Take courage , children , have no care ;</l>
     <l n="300">“ The nightingale in cage is pent ,</l>
     <l n="301">“ May sing now to his heart 's content . ”</l>
