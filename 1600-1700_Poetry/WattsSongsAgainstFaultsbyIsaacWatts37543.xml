    <head>AGAINST LYING .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O ‘ tis a lovely thing for youth</l>
     <l n="2">To walk betimes in wisdom 's way ;</l>
     <l n="3">To fear a lie , to speak the truth ,</l>
     <l n="4">That we may trust to all they say !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">But liars we can never trust ,</l>
     <l n="6">Though they should speak the thing that 's true ;</l>
     <l n="7">And he that does one fault at first ,</l>
     <l n="8">And lies to hide it , makes it two .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Have we not known , nor heard nor read</l>
     <l n="10">How God abhors deceit and wrong ?</l>
     <l n="11">How Ananias was struck dead ,</l>
     <l n="12">Caught with a lie upon his tongue ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">So did his wife Sapphira die ,</l>
     <l n="14">When she came in , and grew so bold</l>
     <l n="15">As to confirm that wicked lie ,</l>
     <l n="16">Which just before her husband told .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">The Lord delights in them that speak</l>
     <l n="18">The words of truth ; but every liar</l>
     <l n="19">Must have his portion in the lake</l>
     <l n="20">That burns with brimstone and with fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Then let me always watch my lips ,</l>
     <l n="22">Lest I be struck to death and hell ,</l>
     <l n="23">Since God a book of reckoning keeps</l>
     <l n="24">For every lie that children tell .</l>

     <l n="1">Whatever brawls disturb the street ,</l>
     <l n="2">There should be peace at home ;</l>
     <l n="3">Where sisters dwell and brothers meet</l>
     <l n="4">Quarrels should never come .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Birds in their little nests agree ;</l>
     <l n="6">And ‘ tis a shameful sight ,</l>
     <l n="7">When children of one family</l>
     <l n="8">Fall out , and chide , and fight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Hard names at first , and threat'ning words</l>
     <l n="10">That are but noisy breath ,</l>

     <l n="12">To murder and to death .</l>

     <l n="13">The devil tempts one mother 's son</l>
     <l n="14">To rage against another :</l>

     <l n="16">Till he had kill 'd his brother .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">The wise will let their anger cool ,</l>
     <l n="18">At least before ‘ tis night ;</l>

     <l n="20">It burns till morning light .</l>

     <l n="21">Pardon , O Lord , our childish rage ,</l>
     <l n="22">Our little brawls remove ,</l>

     <l n="9">In works of labor or of skill</l>

    <head>SOLEMN THOUGHTS ON GOD AND DEATH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There is a God that reigns above ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lord of the heavens , and earth , and seas :</l>
     <l n="3">I fear his wrath , I ask his love ,</l>
     <l n="4">And with my lips I sing his praise .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">There is a law which he has writ ,</l>
     <l n="6">To teach us all what we must do :</l>
     <l n="7">My soul , to his commands submit ,</l>
     <l n="8">For they are holy , just , and true .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">There is a Gospel of rich grace ,</l>
     <l n="10">Whence sinners all their comforts draw :</l>
     <l n="11">Lord , I repent , and seek thy face ,</l>
     <l n="12">For I have often broke thy law .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">There is an hour when I must die ,</l>
     <l n="14">Nor do I know how soon ‘ twill come :</l>
     <l n="15">A thousand children , young as I ,</l>
     <l n="16">Are call 'd by death to hear their doom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Let me improve the hours I have ,</l>
     <l n="18">Before the day of grace is fled :</l>
     <l n="19">There 's no repentance in the grave ,</l>
     <l n="20">No pardon offer 'd to the dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Just as a tree cut down , that fell</l>
     <l n="22">To north or southward , there it lies ,</l>
     <l n="23">So man departs to heaven or hell ,</l>
     <l n="24">Fix 'd in the state wherein he dies .</l>

    <head>SUMMER 'S EVENING .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How fine has the day been ! how bright was the sun !</l>
     <l n="2">How lovely and joyful the course that he run ;</l>
     <l n="3">Though he rose in a mist when his race he begun ,</l>
     <l n="4">And there follow 'd some droppings of rain :</l>
     <l n="5">But now the fair traveler 's come to the west ,</l>
     <l n="6">His rays are all gold , and his beauties are best ;</l>
     <l n="7">He paints the skies gay as he sinks to his rest ,</l>
     <l n="8">And foretells a bright rising again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Just such is the Christian . His course he begins</l>
     <l n="10">Like the sun in a mist , while he mourns for his sins ,</l>
     <l n="11">And melts into tears ; then he breaks out and shines ,</l>
     <l n="12">And travels his heavenly way :</l>
     <l n="13">But when he comes nearer to finish his race</l>
     <l n="14">Like a fine setting sun , he looks richer in grace ;</l>
     <l n="15">And gives a sure hope , at the end of his days</l>
     <l n="16">Of rising in brighter array .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">His soul was gentle as a lamb ;</l>

     <l n="16">And God his Father , too .</l>

     <l n="17">Now , Lord of all , he reigns above ;</l>
