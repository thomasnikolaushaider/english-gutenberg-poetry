   <p>THE CUDGELLED AND CONTENTED CUCKOLD</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SOME time ago from Rome , in smart array ,</l>
     <l n="2">A younger brother homeward bent his way ,</l>
     <l n="3">Not much improved , as frequently the case</l>
     <l n="4">With those who travel to that famous place .</l>
     <l n="5">Upon the road oft finding , where he stayed ,</l>
     <l n="6">Delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid ,</l>
     <l n="7">With careless ease he loitered up and down .—</l>
     <l n="8">One day there passed him in a country town ,</l>
     <l n="9">Attended by a page , a lady fair ,</l>
     <l n="10">Whose charming form and all-engaging air ,</l>
     <l n="11">At once his bosom fired with fond desire ;</l>
     <l n="12">And nearer still , her beauties to admire .</l>
     <l n="13">He most gallantly saw her safely home ;</l>
     <l n="14">Attentions charm the sex where'er we roam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">OUR thoughtless rambler pleasures always sought :</l>
     <l n="16">From Rome this spark had num'rous pardons brought ;</l>
     <l n="17">But ,— as to virtues ( this too oft we find ) ,</l>
     <l n="18">He 'd left them ,— with his HOLINESS behind !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">THE lady was , by ev'ry one , confessed ,</l>
     <l n="20">Of beauty , youth , and elegance possessed ;</l>
     <l n="21">She wanted naught to form her bliss below ,</l>
     <l n="22">But one whose love would ever fondly flow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">INDEED so fickle proved this giddy youth ,</l>
     <l n="24">That nothing long would please his heart or tooth ;</l>
     <l n="25">Howe'er he earnestly inquired her name ,</l>
     <l n="26">And ev'ry other circumstance the same .</l>
     <l n="27">She 's lady , they replied , to great ‘ squire Good ,</l>
     <l n="28">Who 's almost bald from age ‘ tis understood ;</l>
     <l n="29">But as he 's rich , and high in rank appears ,</l>
     <l n="30">Why that 's a recompense you know for years .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="31">THESE facts our young gallant no sooner gained ,</l>
     <l n="32">But ardent hopes at once he entertained ;</l>
     <l n="33">To wily plots his mind he quickly bent ,</l>
     <l n="34">And to a neighb'ring town his servants sent ;</l>
     <l n="35">Then , at the house where dwelled our noble ‘ squire ,</l>
     <l n="36">His humble services proposed for hire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="37">PRETENDING ev'ry sort of work he knew ,</l>
     <l n="38">He soon a fav'rite with old Square-toes grew ,</l>
     <l n="39">Who ( first advising with his charming mate ) ,</l>
     <l n="40">Chief falc'ner made him o'er his fine estate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="41">THE new domestick much the lady pleased ;</l>
     <l n="42">He watched and eagerly the moment seized ,</l>
     <l n="43">His ardent passion boldly to declare ,</l>
     <l n="44">In which he showed a novice had no share .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="45">‘ TWAS managed well , for nothing but the chase ,</l>
     <l n="46">Could Square-toes tempt to quit her fond embrace ,</l>
     <l n="47">And then our falc'ner must his steps attend :—</l>
     <l n="48">The very time he wished at home to spend .</l>
     <l n="49">The lady similar emotions showed ;</l>
     <l n="50">For opportunity their bosoms glowed ;</l>
     <l n="51">And who will feel in argument so bold ,</l>
     <l n="52">When this I say , the contrary to hold ?</l>
     <l n="53">At length with pity Cupid saw the case ,</l>
     <l n="54">And kindly lent his aid to their embrace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="55">ONE night the lady said , with eager eyes ,</l>
     <l n="56">My dear , among our servants , which d'ye prize ,</l>
     <l n="57">For moral conduct most and upright heart ?</l>
     <l n="58">To this her spouse replied , the faithful part</l>
     <l n="59">Is with the falc'ner found , I must decide :</l>
     <l n="60">To him my life I 'd readily confide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="61">THEN you are wrong , said she ,— most truly so ,</l>
     <l n="62">For he 's a good-for-nothing wretch I know ;</l>
     <l n="63">You 'll scarcely credit it , but t'other day ,</l>
     <l n="64">He had the barefaced impudence to say ,</l>
     <l n="65">He loved me much , and then his passion pressed :</l>
     <l n="66">I 'd nearly fallen , I was so distressed .</l>
     <l n="67">To tear his eyes out , I designed at first ,</l>
     <l n="68">And e'en to choke this wretch , of knaves the worst ;</l>
     <l n="69">By prudence solely was I then restrained ,</l>
     <l n="70">For fear the world should think his point was gained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="71">THE better then to prove his dark intent ,</l>
     <l n="72">I feigned an inclination to consent ,</l>
     <l n="73">And in the garden , promised as to-night ,</l>
     <l n="74">I 'd near the pear-tree meet this roguish wight .</l>
     <l n="75">Said I , my husband never moves from hence ;</l>
     <l n="76">No jealous fancy , but to show the sense</l>
     <l n="77">He entertains of my pure , virtuous life ,</l>
     <l n="78">And fond affection for a loving wife .</l>
     <l n="79">Thus circumstanced , your wishes see are vain ,</l>
     <l n="80">Unless when he 's asleep a march I gain ,</l>
     <l n="81">And softly stealing from his torpid side ,</l>
     <l n="82">With trembling steps I , to my lover , glide .</l>
     <l n="83">So things remain , my dear ; an odd affair :—</l>
     <l n="84">On this Square-toes ‘ gan to curse and swear ;</l>
     <l n="85">But his fond rib most earnestly besought ,</l>
     <l n="86">His rage to stifle , as she clearly thought ,</l>
     <l n="87">He might in person , if he 'd take the pain ,</l>
     <l n="88">Secure the rascal and redress obtain</l>
     <l n="89">You know , said she , the tree is near the door ,</l>
     <l n="90">Upon the left and bears of fruit great store ;</l>
     <l n="91">But if I may my sentiments express ,</l>
     <l n="92">In cap and petticoats you 'd best to dress ;</l>
     <l n="93">His insolence is great , and you 'll be right ,</l>
     <l n="94">To give your strokes with double force to night ;</l>
     <l n="95">Well work his back ; flat lay him on the ground :—</l>
     <l n="96">A rascal ! honourable ladies round ,</l>
     <l n="97">No doubt he many times has served the same ;</l>
     <l n="98">‘ Tis such impostors characters defame .</l>
     <l n="99">To rouse his wrath the story quite sufficed ;</l>
     <l n="100">The spouse resolved to do as she advised .</l>
     <l n="101">Howe'er to dupe him was an easy lot ;</l>
     <l n="102">The hour arrived , his dress he soon had got ,</l>
     <l n="103">Away he ran with anxious fond delight .</l>
     <l n="104">In hopes the wily spark to trap that night .</l>
     <l n="105">But no one there our easy fool could see ,</l>
     <l n="106">And while he waited near the fav'rite tree ,</l>
     <l n="107">Half dead with cold , the falc'ner slyly stole ,</l>
     <l n="108">To her who had so well contrived the whole ;</l>
     <l n="109">Time , place , and disposition , all combined</l>
     <l n="110">The loving pair to mutual joys resigned .</l>
     <l n="111">When our expert gallant had with the dame ,</l>
     <l n="112">An hour or more indulged his ardent flame ,</l>
     <l n="113">Though forced at length to quit the loving lass ,</l>
     <l n="114">‘ Twas not without the favourite parting glass ;</l>
     <l n="115">He then the garden sought , where long the ‘ squire ,</l>
     <l n="116">Upon the knave had wished to vent his ire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="117">NO sooner he the silly husband spied ,</l>
     <l n="118">But feigning ‘ twas the wily wife he eyed ,</l>
     <l n="119">At once he cried ,— ah , vilest of the sex !</l>
     <l n="120">Are these thy tricks , so good a man to vex ?</l>
     <l n="121">Oh shame upon thee ! thus to treat his love ,</l>
     <l n="122">As pure as snow , descending from above .</l>
     <l n="123">I could not think thou hadst so base a heart ,</l>
     <l n="124">But clear it is , thou need'st a friendly part ,</l>
     <l n="125">And that I 'll act : I asked this rendezvous</l>
     <l n="126">With full intent to see if thou wert true ;</l>
     <l n="127">And , God be praised , without a loose design ,</l>
     <l n="128">To plunge in luxuries pronounced divine .</l>
     <l n="129">Protect me Heav'n ! poor sinner that I 'm here !</l>
     <l n="130">To guard thy honour I will persevere .</l>
     <l n="131">My worthy master could I thus disgrace ?</l>
     <l n="132">Thou wanton baggage with unblushing face ,</l>
     <l n="133">Thee on the spot I 'll instantly chastise ,</l>
     <l n="134">And then thy husband of the fact advise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="135">THE fierce harangue o'er SquarehYpppHeNtoes pleasure spread ,</l>
     <l n="136">Who , mutt'ring ‘ tween his teeth , with fervour said :</l>
     <l n="137">O gracious Lord ! to thee my thanks are due —</l>
     <l n="138">To have a wife so chaste — a man so true !</l>
     <l n="139">But presently he felt upon his back</l>
     <l n="140">The falc'ner ' s cudgel vigorously thwack ,</l>
     <l n="141">Who soundly basted him as on he ran ,</l>
     <l n="142">To gain the house , with terror , pale and wan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="143">THE squire had wished his trusty man , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="144">Had not , at cudgelling , been quite so stout ;</l>
     <l n="145">But since he showed himself so true a friend ,</l>
     <l n="146">And with his actions could such prudence blend ,</l>
     <l n="147">The master fully pardoned what he knew ,</l>
     <l n="148">And quickly to his wife in bed he flew ,</l>
     <l n="149">When he related every thing that passed</l>
     <l n="150">Were we , cried he , a hundred years to last ,</l>
     <l n="151">My lovely dear , we ne'er on earth could find</l>
     <l n="152">A man so faithful , and so well inclined .</l>
     <l n="153">I 'd have him take within our town a wife ,</l>
     <l n="154">And you and I 'll regard him during life .</l>
     <l n="155">In that , replied the lady , we agree ,</l>
     <l n="156">And heartily thereto I pledged will be .</l>

    <head>THE HUSBAND-CONFESSOR</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHEN Francis ( named the first ) o'er Frenchmen reign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="2">In Italy young Arthur laurels gained ,</l>
     <l n="3">And oft such daring valour showed in fight ,</l>
     <l n="4">With ev'ry honour he was made a knight ;</l>
     <l n="5">The monarch placed the spur upon his heel ,</l>
     <l n="6">That all around his proper worth might feel .</l>
     <l n="7">Then household deities at home he sought ,</l>
     <l n="8">Where — not at prayers his beauteous dame he caught :</l>
     <l n="9">He 'd left her , truly , quite dissolv 'd in tears ;</l>
     <l n="10">But now the belle had bid adieu to fears ;</l>
     <l n="11">And oft was dancing joyously around ,</l>
     <l n="12">With all the company that could be found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">GALLANTS in crowds Sir Arthur soon perceived ;</l>
     <l n="14">At sight of these the knight was sorely grieved ;</l>
     <l n="15">And , turning in his mind how best to act ;</l>
     <l n="16">Cried he , Can this be truly held a fact ,</l>
     <l n="17">That I 've been worthy while I 'd fame in view ,</l>
     <l n="18">Of cuckoldom at home , and knighthood too ?</l>
     <l n="19">It ought to be but half :— the truth let 's know ;</l>
     <l n="20">From constancy the purest blessings flow .</l>
     <l n="21">Then like a father-confessor he dressed ,</l>
     <l n="22">And took his seat where priests their flock confessed .</l>
     <l n="23">His lady absolution sought that day ,</l>
     <l n="24">And on her knees before him ‘ gan to pray ;</l>
     <l n="25">The minor sins were told with downcast eyes ,</l>
     <l n="26">And then for hearing those of larger size ,</l>
     <l n="27">The husband-confessor prepared his ears :—</l>
     <l n="28">Said she , Good father , ( ‘ mid a flood of tears ) ,</l>
     <l n="29">My bed receives , ( the fault I fear 's not slight ,)</l>
     <l n="30">A gentleman , a parson , and a knight .</l>
     <l n="31">Still more had followed , but , by rage o'ercome ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sir Arthur cut the thread , and she was mum ;</l>
     <l n="33">Though , doubtless , had the fair been let proceed ,</l>
     <l n="34">Quite long her Litany had been decreed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="35">THe husband , in a rage , exclaimed , thou jade ,</l>
     <l n="36">A parson , say'st thou ? t'whom dost think thou'st made</l>
     <l n="37">This curst confession ?— To my spouse , cried she ,</l>
     <l n="38">I saw you enter here , and came with glee ,</l>
     <l n="39">Supposing you 'd a trick to raise surprise ;</l>
     <l n="40">Howe'er ‘ tis strange that one so very wise ,</l>
     <l n="41">The riddle should not fully comprehend :—</l>
     <l n="42">A KNIGHT , the king created you , my friend ;</l>
     <l n="43">A GENTLEMAN , your rank was long ago ;</l>
     <l n="44">A PARSON , you have made yourself you know .</l>
     <l n="45">Goon heav'ns ! exclaimed the knight , ‘ tis very clear ,</l>
     <l n="46">And I a blockhead surely must appear .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE COBBLER</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">WE 'RE told , that once a cobbler , BLASE by name ;</l>
     <l n="48">A wife had got , whose charms so high in fame ;</l>
     <l n="49">But as it happened , that their cash was spent ,</l>
     <l n="50">The honest couple to a neighbour went ,</l>
     <l n="51">A corn-factor by trade , not overwise</l>
     <l n="52">To whom they stated facts without disguise ;</l>
     <l n="53">And begged , with falt'ring voice denoting care ,</l>
     <l n="54">That he , of wheat , would half a measure spare ,</l>
     <l n="55">Upon their note , which readily he gave ,</l>
     <l n="56">And all advantages desired to wave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="57">THE time for payment came ; the money used ;</l>
     <l n="58">The cash our factor would not be refused ;</l>
     <l n="59">Of writs he talked , attorneys , and distress ;</l>
     <l n="60">The reason :— heav'n can tell , and you may guess ;</l>
     <l n="61">In short , ‘ twas clear our gay gallant desired ,</l>
     <l n="62">To cheer the wife , whose beauty all admired .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">SAID he , what anxiously I wish to get ,</l>
     <l n="64">You 've plenty stored , and never wanted yet ;</l>
     <l n="65">You surely know my meaning ?— Yes , she cried ;</l>
     <l n="66">I 'll turn it in my mind , and we 'll decide</l>
     <l n="67">How best to act . Away she quickly flew ,</l>
     <l n="68">And Blase informed , what Ninny had in view .</l>
     <l n="69">Zounds ! said the cobbler , we must see , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="70">To hook this little sum :— the way is clear ;</l>
     <l n="71">No risk I 'm confident ; for prithee run</l>
     <l n="72">And tell him I 've a journey just begun ;</l>
     <l n="73">That he may hither come and have his will ;</l>
     <l n="74">But ‘ ere he touch thy lips , demand the bill ;</l>
     <l n="75">He 'll not refuse the boon I 'm very sure ;</l>
     <l n="76">Meantime , myself I 'll hide and all secure .</l>
     <l n="77">The note obtained , cough loudly , strong , and clear ;</l>
     <l n="78">Twice let it be , that I may plainly hear ;</l>
     <l n="79">Then forth I 'll sally from my lurking place ,</l>
     <l n="80">And , spite of folly 's frowns , prevent disgrace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="81">THE , plot succeeded as the pair desired ;</l>
     <l n="82">The cobbler laughed , and ALL his scheme admired :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="83">A purse-proud cit thereon observed and swore ;</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Twere better to have coughed when all was o'er ;</l>
     <l n="85">Then you , all three , would have enjoyed your wish ,</l>
     <l n="86">And been in future all as mute as fish .</l>

     <l n="87">OH ! sir , replied the cobbler 's wife at ease ,</l>

    <p>THE PEASANT AND HIS ANGRY LORD</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="93">ONCE on a time , as hist'ry ' s page relates ,</l>
     <l n="94">A lord , possessed of many large estates ,</l>
     <l n="95">Was angry with a poor and humble clod ,</l>
     <l n="96">Who tilled his grounds and feared his very nod .</l>
     <l n="97">Th ’ offence ( as often happens ) was but small ,</l>
     <l n="98">But on him , vowed the peer , his rage should fall —</l>
     <l n="99">Said he , a halter , rascal , you deserve ;</l>
     <l n="100">You 'll never from the gallows-turnpike swerve :</l>
     <l n="101">Or , soon or late you swinging will be found</l>
     <l n="102">Who , born for hanging , ever yet was drowned ?</l>
     <l n="103">Howe'er you 'll smile to hear my lenient voice ;</l>
     <l n="104">Observe , three punishments await your choice ;</l>
     <l n="105">Take which you will .— The first is , you shall eat ,</l>
     <l n="106">Of strongest garlick , thirty heads complete ;</l>
     <l n="107">No drink you 'll have between , nor sleep , nor rest ;</l>
     <l n="108">You know a breach of promise I detest .</l>
     <l n="109">Or , on your shoulders further I propose ,</l>
     <l n="110">To give you , with a cudgel , thirty blows .</l>
     <l n="111">Or , if more pleasing , that you truly pay ,</l>
     <l n="112">The sum of thirty pounds without delay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="113">THE peasant ‘ gan to turn things in his mind :—</l>
     <l n="114">Said he , to take the heads I 'm not inclined ;</l>
     <l n="115">No drink , you say , between ; that makes it worse ;</l>
     <l n="116">To eat the garlick thus , would prove a curse .</l>
     <l n="117">Nor can I suffer on my tender back ,</l>
     <l n="118">That , with a cudgel , thirty blows you thwack .</l>
     <l n="119">Still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared ;</l>
     <l n="120">Uncertain how to act , he hanging feared .</l>
     <l n="121">The noble peer he begged , upon his knees ,</l>
     <l n="122">His penitence to hear , and sentence ease .</l>
     <l n="123">But mercy dwelled not with the angry lord</l>
     <l n="124">Is this , cried he , the answer ?— bring a cord .</l>
     <l n="125">The peasant , trembling lest his life was sought ;</l>
     <l n="126">The garlick chose , which presently was brought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="127">UPON a dish my lord the number told ;</l>
     <l n="128">Clod no way liked the garlick to behold .</l>
     <l n="129">With piteous mien the garlick head he took ,</l>
     <l n="130">Then on it num'rous ways was led to look ,</l>
     <l n="131">And grumbling much , began to spit and eat ,</l>
     <l n="132">just like a cat with mustard on her meat ,</l>
     <l n="133">To touch it with his tongue he durst not do ;</l>
     <l n="134">He knew not how to act or what pursue .</l>
     <l n="135">The peer , delighted at the man 's distress ,</l>
     <l n="136">The garlick made him bite , and chew , and press ,</l>
     <l n="137">Then gulp it down as if delicious fare ;</l>
     <l n="138">The first he passed ; the second made him swear ;</l>
     <l n="139">The third he found was every whit as sad ,</l>
     <l n="140">He wished the devil had it , ‘ twas so bad .</l>
     <l n="141">In short , when at the twelfth our wight arrived ,</l>
     <l n="142">He thought his mouth and throat of skin deprived .</l>
     <l n="143">Said he , some drink I earnestly intreat ;</l>
     <l n="144">What , Greg'ry , cried my lord , dost feel a heat ;</l>
     <l n="145">In thy repasts dost love to wet thy jaws ?</l>
     <l n="146">Well ! well ! I wo n't object ; thou know'st my laws ;</l>
     <l n="147">Much good may't do thee ; here , some wine , some wine !</l>
     <l n="148">Yet recollect , to drink , since you design ,</l>
     <l n="149">That afterward , my friend , you 'll have to choose</l>
     <l n="150">The thirty blows , or thirty pounds to lose .</l>
     <l n="151">But , cried the peasant , I sincerely pray ,</l>
     <l n="152">Your lordship 's goodness , that the garlick may</l>
     <l n="153">Be taken in the account , for as to pelf ,</l>
     <l n="154">Where can an humble lab'rer , like myself ,</l>
     <l n="155">Expect the sum of thirty pounds to seize ?</l>
     <l n="156">Then , said the peer , be cudgelled if you please ;</l>
     <l n="157">Take thirty thwacks ; for naught the garlick goes .</l>
     <l n="158">To moisten well his throat , and ease his woes ,</l>
     <l n="159">The peasant drank a copious draught of wine ,</l>
     <l n="160">And then to bear the cudgel would resign .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="161">A SINGLE blow he patiently endured ;</l>
     <l n="162">The second , howsoe'er , his patience cured ;</l>
     <l n="163">The third was more severe , and each was worse ;</l>
     <l n="164">The punishment he now began to curse ;</l>
     <l n="165">Two lusty wights , with cudgels thrashed his back</l>
     <l n="166">And regularly gave him thwack and thwack ;</l>
     <l n="167">He cried , he roared , for grace he begged his lord ,</l>
     <l n="168">Who marked each blow , and would no ease accord ;</l>
     <l n="169">But carefully observed , from time to time ,</l>
     <l n="170">That lenity he always thought sublime ;</l>
     <l n="171">His gravity preserved ; considered too</l>
     <l n="172">The blows received and what continued due .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="173">AT length , when Greg'ry twenty strokes had got ,</l>
     <l n="174">He piteously exclaimed :— if more 's my lot</l>
     <l n="175">I never shall survive ! Oh ! pray forgive ,</l>
     <l n="176">If you desire , my lord , that I should live .</l>
     <l n="177">Then down with thirty pounds , replied the peer ,</l>
     <l n="178">Since you the blows so much pretend to fear ;</l>
     <l n="179">I 'm sorry for you ; but if all the gold</l>
     <l n="180">Be not prepared , your godfather , I 'm told ,</l>
     <l n="181">Can lend a part ; yet , since so far you 've been ,</l>
     <l n="182">To flinch the rest you surely wo n't be seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="183">THE wretched peasant to his lordship flew ,</l>
     <l n="184">And trembling cried — ‘ tis up ! the number view !</l>
     <l n="185">A scrutiny was made , which nothing gained ;</l>
     <l n="186">No choice but pay the money now remained ;</l>
     <l n="187">This grieved him much , and o'er the fellow 's face ;</l>
     <l n="188">The dewy drops were seen to flow apace .</l>
     <l n="189">All useless proved :— the full demand he sent ,</l>
     <l n="190">With which the peer expressed himself content .</l>
     <l n="191">Unlucky he whoe'er his lord offends !</l>
     <l n="192">To golden ore , howe'er , the proud man bends :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="193">‘ TWAS vain that Gregory a pardon prayed ;</l>
     <l n="194">For trivial faults the peasant dearly paid ;</l>
     <l n="195">His throat enflamed — his tender back well beat —</l>
     <l n="196">His money gone — and all to make complete ,</l>
     <l n="197">Without the least deduction for the pain ,</l>
     <l n="198">The blows and garlick gave the trembling swain .</l>
