    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">La Montre : or , The Lover 's Watch , ‘ Licensed 2 Aug. 1686 . R. L. S . ’ is taken by Mrs. Behn from La Montre of Balthazar de Bonnecorse . After having received an excellent education at Marseilles , where he was born , de Bonnecorse was appointed consul at Cairo , and later transferred to Sidon in the Levant . Whilst at Cairo he composed La Montre , a mixture of prose and verse , which he sent to the great arbiter of Parisian taste , Georges de Scuderi , under whose care it was printed in 1666 at Paris . It was followed in 1671 by the second part , la Boete et le Miroir , dedicated to the Duke de Vivonne . Upon his return to France , de Bonnecorse abridged La Montre and put it wholly into verse , in which form it appears in his collected ( yet incomplete ) works , ‘ Chez Theodore Haak . ’ Leyden , 1720 . Bonnecorse died at Marseilles in 1706 . He is always piquant and graceful in his madrigals and songs , though both sentiment and verse have faded a little with the passing of time . Boileau immortalized him in Le Lutrin : la Montre is one of the missiles the enraged canons hurl at each other 's reverend pates : ‘ L'un prend l'Edit d'amour , l'autre en saisit la Montre . ’ Bonnecorse 's attempted parody on Le Lutrin , le Lutrigot ( Marseille , 1686 ) , is of no value , and brought a caustic epigram down on his head .</p>

  <body>
   <p>To Peter Weston , Esq . ; Of The Honourable Society Of The Inner-Temple .</p>
   <p>Sir ,</p>
   <p>When I had ended this little unlaboured Piece , the Watch , I resolv 'd to dedicate it to some One , whom I cou 'd fancy , the nearest approacht the charming Damon . Many fine Gentlemen I had in view , of Wit and Beauty ; but still , through their Education , or a natural Propensity to Debauchery , I found those Vertues wanting , that should compleat that delicate Character , Iris gives her Lover ; and which , at first Thought of You , I found center 'd there to Perfection .</p>
   <p>Yes , Sir , I found You had all the Youth of Damon ; without the forward noisy Confidence , which usually attends your Sex . You have all the attracting Beauty of my young Hero ; all that can charm the Fair ; without the Affectation of those , that set out for Conquests ( though You make a Thousand , without knowing it , or the Vanity of believing it . ) You have our Damon 's Wit with all his agreeable Modesty : Two Vertues that rarely shine together : And the last makes You conceal the noble Sallies of the first , with that Industry and Care , You wou 'd an Amour : And You wou 'd no more boast of either of these , than of your undoubted Bravery .</p>
   <p>You are ( like our Lover too ) so discreet , that the bashful Maid may , without Fear or Blushing , venture the soft Confession of the Soul with You ; reposing the dear Secret in Yours , with more Safety than with her own Thoughts . You have all the Sweetness of Youth , with the Sobriety and Prudence of Age . You have all the Power of the gay Vices of Man ; but the Angel in your Mind , has subdu 'd you to the Vertues of a God ! And all the vicious and industrious Examples of the roving Wits of the mad Town , have only served to give You the greater Abhorrence to Lewdness . And You look down with Contempt and Pity on that wretched unthinking Number , who pride themselves in their mean Victories over little Hearts ; and boast their common Prizes with that Vanity , that declares ‘ em capable of no higher Joy , than that of the Ruin of some credulous Unfortunate : And no Glory like that , of the Discovery of the brave Achievement , over the next Bottle , to the Fool that shall applaud ‘ em .</p>
   <p>How does the Generosity , and Sweetness of your Disposition despise these false Entertainments , that turns the noble Passion of Love into Ridicule , and Man into Brute .</p>
   <p>Methinks I cou 'd form another Watch ( that should remain a Pattern to succeeding Ages ) how divinely you pass your more sacred Hours , how nobly and usefully You divide your Time : in which , no precious minute is lost , not one glides idly by ; but all turns to wondrous Account . And all Your Life is one continu 'd Course of Vertue and Honour . Happy the Parents that have the Glory to own You ! Happy the Man , that has the Honour of your Friendship ! But , oh ! How much more happy the fair She , for whom you shall sigh ! Which surely , can never be in vain .</p>
   <p>There will be such a Purity in Your Flame : All You ask will be so chaste and noble , and utter 'd with a Voice so modest , and a Look so charming , as must , by a gentle Force , compel that Heart to yield , that knows the true Value of Wit , Beauty , and Vertue .</p>
   <p>Since then , in all the Excellencies of Mind and Body ( where no one Grace is wanting ) you so resemble the All-perfect Damon , suffer me to dedicate this Watch to You . It brings You nothing but Rules for Love ; delicate as Your Thoughts , and innocent as Your Conversation . And possibly , ‘ tis the only Vertue of the Mind , You are not perfectly Master of ; the only noble Mystery of the Soul , You have not yet studied . And though they are Rules for every Hour , You will find , they will neither rob Heaven , nor Your Friends of ther Due ; those so valuable Devoirs of Your Life ; They will teach You Love ; but Love , so pure , and so devout , that You may mix it , even with Your Religion ; and I know , Your fine Mind can admit of no other . When ever the God enters there ( fond and wanton as he is , full of Arts and Guiles ) he will be reduc 'd to that Native Innocency , that made him so ador 'd , before inconstant Man corrupted his Divinity , and made him wild and wandring . How happy will Iris 's Watch be , to inspire such a Heart ! How honour 'd under the Patronage of so excellent a Man ! Whose Wit will credit , whose Goodness will defend it ; and whose noble and vertuous Qualities so justly merit the Character Iris has given Damon : And which is believed so very much your Due , by</p>

     <l n="57">The ARGUMENT .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Tis in the most happy and august Court of the best and greatest Monarch of the World , that Damon , a young Nobleman , whom we will render under that Name , languishes for a Maid of Quality , who will give us leave to call her Iris .</p>
   <p>Their Births are equally illustrious ; they are both rich , and both young ; their Beauty such as I dare not too nicely particularize , lest I should discover ( which I am not permitted to do ) who these charming Lovers are . Let it suffice , that Iris is the most fair and accomplisht Person that ever adorn 'd a Court ; and that Damon is only worthy of the Glory of her Favour ; for he has all that can render him lovely in the fair Eyes of the amiable Iris . Nor is he Master of those superficial Beauties alone , that please at first sight ; he can charm the Soul with a thousand Arts of Wit and Gallantry . And , in a word , I may say , without flattering either , that there is no one Beauty , no one Grace , no Perfection of Mind and Body , that wants to compleat a Victory on both sides .</p>
   <p>The agreement of Age , Fortunes , Quality and Humours in the two fair Lovers , made the impatient Damon hope , that no thing would oppose his Passion ; and if he saw himself every hour languishing for the adorable Maid , he did not however despair : And if Iris sigh 'd , it was not for fear of being one day more happy .</p>
   <p>In the midst of the Tranquillity of these two Lovers , Iris was obliged to go into the Country for some Months , whither ‘ twas impossible for Damon to wait on her , he being oblig 'd to attend the King his Master ; and being the most amorous of his Sex , suffer 'd with extreme Impatience the Absence of his Mistress . Nevertheless , he fail 'd not to send to her every day , and gave up all his melancholy Hours to Thinking , Sighing , and Writing to her the softest Letters that Love could inspire . So that Iris even blessed that Absence that gave her so tender and convincing Proofs of his Passion ; and found this dear way of Conversing , even recompensed all her Sighs for his Absence .</p>
   <p>After a little Intercourse of this kind , Damon bethought himself to ask Iris a Discretion which he had won of her before she left the Town ; and in a Billetdoux to that purpose , prest her very earnestly for it . Iris being infinitely pleas 'd with his Importunity , suffer 'd him to ask it often ; and he never fail 'd of doing so .</p>
   <p>But as I do not here design to relate the Adventures of these two amiable Persons , nor to give you all the Billet-doux that past between them ; you shall here find nothing but the Watch this charming Maid sent her impatient Lover .</p>
   <p>IRIS to DAMON .</p>
   <p>It must be confest , Damon , that you are the most importuning Man in the World . Your Billets have a hundred times demanded a Discretion , which you won of me ; and tell me , you will not wait my Return to be paid . You are either a very faithless Creditor , or believe me very unjust , that you dun with such impatience . But to let you see that I am a Maid of Honour , and value my Word , I will acquit my self of this Obligation I have to you , and send you a Watch of my fashion ; perhaps you never saw any so good . It is not one of those that have always something to be mended in it : but one that is without fault , very just and good , and will remain so as long as you continue to love me : But Damon , know , the very Minute you cease to do so , the String will break , and it will go no more . ‘ Tis only useful in my Absence , and when I return ‘ twill change its Motion : and though I have set it but for the Spring-time , ‘ twill serve you the whole Year round : and ‘ twill be necessary only that you alter the Business of the Hours ( which my Cupid , in the middle of my Watch , points you out ) according to the length of the Days and Nights . Nor is the Dart of that little God directed to those Hours , so much to inform you how they pass , as how you ought to pass them ; how you ought to employ those of your Absence from Iris . ‘ Tis there you shall find the whole Business of a Lover , from his Mistress ; for I have design 'd it a Rule to all your Actions . The Consideration of the Work-man ought to make you set a Value upon the Work : And though it be not an accomplisht and perfect piece ; yet , Damon , you ought to be grateful and esteem it , since I have made it for you alone . But however I may boast of the Design , I know , as well as I believe you love me , that you will not suffer me to have the Glory of it wholly , but will say in your Heart ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">That Love , the great Instructor of the Mind ,</l>
     <l n="2">That forms anew , and fashions every Soul ,</l>
     <l n="3">Refines the gross Defects of human Kind ;</l>
     <l n="4">Humbles the proud and vain , inspires the dull ;</l>
     <l n="5">Gives Cowards noble Heat in Fight ,</l>
     <l n="6">And teaches feeble Women how to write :</l>
     <l n="7">That doth the Universe Command ,</l>
     <l n="8">Does from my Iris ’ Heart direct her Hand .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I give you the Liberty to say this to your Heart , if you please : And that you may know with what Justice you do so , I will confess in my turn .</p>
   <p>The Confession .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">That Love 's my Conduct where I go ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Love instructs me all I do .</l>
     <l n="3">Prudence no longer is my Guide ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor take I Counsel of my Pride .</l>
     <l n="5">In vain does Honour now invade ,</l>
     <l n="6">In vain does Reason take my part ,</l>
     <l n="7">If against Love it do persuade ,</l>
     <l n="8">If it rebel against my Heart .</l>
     <l n="9">If the soft Ev'ning do invite ,</l>
     <l n="10">And I incline to take the Air ,</l>
     <l n="11">The Birds , the Spring , the Flow'rs no more delight ;</l>
     <l n="12">‘ Tis Love makes all the Pleasure there :</l>
     <l n="13">Love , which about me still I bear ;</l>
     <l n="14">I 'm charm 'd with what I thither bring ,</l>
     <l n="15">And add a Softness to the Spring .</l>
     <l n="16">If for Devotion I design ,</l>
     <l n="17">Love meets me , even at the Shrine ;</l>
     <l n="18">In all my Worships claims a part ,</l>
     <l n="19">And robs even Heaven of my Heart :</l>
     <l n="20">All Day does counsel aud controul ,</l>
     <l n="21">And all the Night employs my Soul .</l>
     <l n="22">No wonder then if all you think be true ,</l>
     <l n="23">That Love 's concern 'd in all I do for you .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And , Damon , you , know that Love is no ill Master ; and I must say , with a Blush , that he has found me no unapt Scholar ; and he instructs too agreeably not to succeed in all he undertakes .</p>
   <p>Who can resist his soft Commands ? When he resolves , what God withstands ?</p>
   <p>But I ought to explain to you my Watch : The naked Love which you will find in the middle of it , with his Wings clipp 'd , to shew you he is fixed and constant , and will not fly away , points you out with his Arrow the four and twenty Hours that compose the Day and the Night : Over every Hour you will find written what you ought to do , during its Course ; and every Half-hour is marked with a Sigh , since the quality of a Lover is , to sigh day and night : Sighs are the Children of Lovers , that are born every Hour . And that my Watch may always be just , Love himself ought to conduct it ; and your Heart should keep time with the Movement :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">My Present 's delicate and new ,</l>
     <l n="2">If by your Heart the Motion 's set ;</l>
     <l n="3">According as that 's false or true ,</l>
     <l n="4">You 'll find my Watch will answer it .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Every Hour is tedious to a Lover separated from his Mistress : and to shew you how good I am , I will have my Watch instruct you , to pass some of them without Inquietude ; that the force of your Imagination may sometimes charm the Trouble you have for my Absence :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Perhaps I am mistaken here ,</l>
     <l n="2">My Heart may too much Credit give :</l>
     <l n="3">But , Damon , you can charm my Fear ,</l>
     <l n="4">And soon my Error undeceive .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But I will not disturb my Repose at this time with a Jealousy , which I hope is altogether frivolous and vain ; but begin to instruct you in the Mysteries of my Watch . Cast then your Eyes upon the eighth Hour in the Morning , which is the Hour I would have you begin to wake : you will find there written ,</p>
   <p>EIGHT o'CLOCK .</p>
   <p>Agreeable Reverie .</p>
   <p>Do not rise yet ; you may find Thoughts agreeable enough , when you awake , to entertain you longer in Bed . And ‘ tis in that Hour you ought to recollect all the Dreams you had in the Night . If you had dream 'd any thing to my advantage , confirm your self in that thought ; but if to my disadvantage , renounce it , and disown the injurious Dream . ‘ Tis in this Hour also that I give you leave to reflect on all that I have ever said and done , that has been most obliging to you , and that gives you the most tender Sentiments .</p>
   <p>The Reflections .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Remember , Damon , while your Mind</l>
     <l n="2">Reflects on things that charm and please ,</l>
     <l n="3">You give me Proofs that you are kind ,</l>
     <l n="4">And set my doubting Soul at ease :</l>
     <l n="5">For when your Heart receives with Joy</l>
     <l n="6">The thoughts of Favours which I give ,</l>
     <l n="7">My Smiles in vain I not employ ,</l>
     <l n="8">And on the Square we love and live .</l>
     <l n="9">Think then on all I ever did ,</l>
     <l n="10">That e'er was charming , e'er was dear ;</l>
     <l n="11">Let nothing from that Soul be hid ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whose Griefs and Joys I feel and share .</l>
     <l n="13">All that your Love and Faith have sought , }</l>
     <l n="14">All that your Vows and Sighs have bought , }</l>
     <l n="15">Now render present to your Thought . }</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And for what 's to come , I give you leave , Damon , to flatter your self , and to expect , I shall still pursue those Methods , whose Remembrance charms so well : But , if it be possible , conceive these kind Thoughts between sleeping and waking , that all my too forward Complaisance , my Goodness , and my Tenderness , which I confess to have for you , may pass for Half Dreams : for ‘ tis most certain ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">That tho ’ the Favours of the Fair</l>
     <l n="2">Are ever to the Lover dear ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet , lest he should reproach that easy Flame ,</l>
     <l n="4">That buys its Satisfaction with its Shame ;</l>
     <l n="5">She ought but rarely to confess</l>
     <l n="6">How much she finds of Tenderness ;</l>
     <l n="7">Nicely to guard the yielding part ,</l>
     <l n="8">And hide the hard-kept Secret in her Heart .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For , let me tell you , Damon , tho ’ the Passion of a Woman of Honour be ever so innocent , and the Lover never so discreet and honest ; her Heart feels I know not what of Reproach within , at the reflection of any Favours she has allow 'd him . For my part , I never call to mind the least soft or kind Word I have spoken to Damon , without finding at the same instant my Face cover 'd over with Blushes , and my Heart with sensible Pain . I sigh at the Remembrance of every Touch I have stolen from his Hand , and have upbraided my Soul , which confesses so much guilty Love , as that secret Desire of touching him made appear . I am angry at the Discovery , though I am pleas 'd at the same time with the Satisfaction I take in doing so ; and ever disorder 'd at the Remembrance of such Arguments of too much Love . And these unquiet Sentiments alone are sufficient to persuade me , that our Sex cannot be reserv 'd too much . And I have often , on these occasions , said to my self ,</p>
   <p>The Reserve .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Tho ’ Damon every Virtue have ,</l>
     <l n="2">With all that pleases in his Form ,</l>
     <l n="3">That can adorn the Just and Brave ,</l>
     <l n="4">That can the coldest Bosom warm ;</l>
     <l n="5">Tho ’ Wit and Honour there abound ,</l>
     <l n="6">Yet the Pursuer 's ne'er pursu 'd ,</l>
     <l n="7">And when my Weakness he has found ,</l>
     <l n="8">His Love will sink to Gratitude :</l>
     <l n="9">While on the asking part he lives ,</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Tis she th ’ Obliger is who gives .</l>

     <l n="23">Put me on nothing that may please ,</l>
     <l n="24">But only such as may give no Offence .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Say to your self , as you are dressing , ‘ Would it please Heaven , that I might see Iris to-day ! But oh ! ‘ tis impossible : Therefore all that I shall see will be but indifferent Objects , since ‘ tis Iris only that I wish to see . ’ And sighing , whisper to your self :</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>My Cupid points you now to the Hour in which you ought to retire into your Cabinet , having already past an Hour in Dressing : and for a Lover , who is sure not to appear before his Mistress , even that Hour is too much to be so employ 'd . But I will think , you thought of nothing less than Dressing while you were about it . Lose then no more Minutes , but open your Scrutore , and read over some of those Billets you have received from me . Oh ! what Pleasures a Lover feels about his Heart , in reading those from a Mistress he entirely loves !</p>
   <p>The Joy .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Who , but a Lover , can express</l>
     <l n="2">The Joys , the Pants , the Tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="3">That the soft amorous Soul invades ,</l>
     <l n="4">While the dear Billetdoux he reads :</l>
     <l n="5">Raptures Divine the Heart o'erflow ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which he that loves not cannot know .</l>
     <l n="7">A thousand Tremblings , thousand Fears ,</l>
     <l n="8">The short-breath 'd Sighs , the joyful Tears !</l>
     <l n="9">The Transport , where the Love 's confest ;</l>
     <l n="10">The Change , where Coldness is exprest ;</l>
     <l n="11">The diff'ring Flames the Lover burns ,</l>
     <l n="12">As those are shy , or kind , by turns .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>However you find'em , Damon , construe ‘ em all to my advantage : Possibly , some of them have an Air of Coldness , something different from that Softness they are usually too amply fill 'd with ; but where you find they have , believe there , that the Sense of Honour , and my Sex 's Modesty , guided my Hand a little against the Inclinations of my Heart ; and that it was as a kind of an Atonement , I believed I ought to make , for something I feared I had said too kind , and too obliging before . But where-ever you find that Stop , that Check in my Career of Love , you will be sure to find something that follows it to favour you , and deny that unwilling Imposition upon my Heart ; which , lest you should mistake , Love shews himself in Smiles again , and flatters more agreeably , disdaining the Tyranny of Honour and rigid Custom , that Imposition on our Sex ; and will , in spite of me , let you see he reigns absolutely in my Soul .</p>
   <p>The reading my Billetdoux may detain you an Hour : I have had so much Goodness to write you enow to entertain you for so long at least , and sometimes reproach my self for it ; but , contrary to all my Scruples , I find my self disposed to give you those frequent Marks of my Tenderness . If yours be so great as you express it , you ought to kiss my Letters a thousand times ; you ought to read them with Attention , and weigh every Word , and value every Line . A Lover may receive a thousand endearing Words from a Mistress , more easily than a Billet . One says a great many kind things of course to a Lover , which one is not willing to write , or to give testify 'd under one 's Hand , signed and sealed . But when once a Lover has brought his Mistress to that degree of Love , he ought to assure himself , she loves not at the common rate .</p>

     <l n="15">On which the Lover present never thought ,</l>
     <l n="16">That recompense the Hours we grieve .</l>

   <p>With this little Rapture , I wish you wou 'd finish the reading my Letters , shut your Scrutore , and quit your Cabinet ; for my Love leads to eleven o'clock .</p>
   <p>ELEVEN o'CLOCK .</p>
   <p>The Hour to write in .</p>
   <p>If my Watch did not inform you ‘ tis now time to write , I believe , Damon , your Heart wou 'd , and tell you also that I should take it kindly , if you would employ a whole Hour that way ; and that you should never lose an Occasion of writing to me , since you are assured of the Welcome I give your Letters . Perhaps you will say , an Hour is too much , and that ‘ tis not the mode to write long Letters . I grant you , Damon , when we write those indifferent ones of Gallantry in course , or necessary Compliment ; the handsome comprizing of which in the fewest Words , renders ‘ em the most agreeable : But in Love we have a thousand foolish things to say , that of themselves bear no great Sound , but have a mighty Sense in Love ; for there is a peculiar Eloquence natural alone to a Lover , and to be understood by no other Creature : To those , Words have a thousand Graces and Sweetnesses ; which , to the Unconcerned , appear Meanness , and easy Sense , at the best . But , Damon , you and I are none of those ill Judges of the Beauties of Love ; we can penetrate beyond the Vulgar , and perceive the fine Soul in every Line , thro ’ all the humble Dress of Phrase ; when possibly they who think they discern it best in florid Language , do not see it at all . Love was not born or bred in Courts , but Cottages ; and , nurs 'd in Groves and Shades , smiles on the Plains , and wantons in the Streams ; all unador 'd and harmless . Therefore , Damon , do not consult your Wit in this Affair , but Love alone ; speak all that he and Nature taught you , and let the fine Things you learn in Schools alone : Make use of those Flowers you have gather 'd there , when you converst with States-men and the Gown . Let Iris possess your Heart in all its simple Innocence , that 's the best Eloquence to her that loves : and that is my Instruction to a Lover that would succeed in his Amours ; for I have a Heart very difficult to please , and this is the nearest way to it .</p>

     <l n="3">Without dull Speaking , sure must be</l>

     <l n="6">And the first Sacred Mystery impute</l>
     <l n="7">Of Letters to the learned Brood ,</l>

     <l n="9">‘ Twas Love alone that first the Art essay 'd , }</l>

     <l n="11">That was by the dear Billetdoux betray 'd . }</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is an Art too ingenious to have been found out by Man , and too necessary to Lovers , not to have been invented by the God of Love himself . But , Damon , I do not pretend to exact from you those Letters of Gallantry , which , I have told you , are filled with nothing but fine Thoughts , and writ with all the Arts of Wit and Subtilty : I would have yours still all tender unaffected Love , Words unchosen , Thoughts unstudied , and Love unfeign 'd . I had rather find more Softness than Wit in your Passion ; more of Nature than of Art ; more of the Lover than the Poet .</p>
   <p>Nor would I have you write any of those little short Letters , that are read over in a Minute ; in Love , long Letters bring a long Pleasure : Do not trouble your self to make ‘ em fine , or write a great deal of Wit and Sense in a few Lines ; that is the Notion of a witty Billet , in any Affair but that of Love . And have a care rather to avoid these Graces to a Mistress ; and assure your self , dear Damon , that what pleases the Soul pleases the Eye , and the Largeness or Bulk of your Letter shall never offend me ; and that I only am displeased when I find them small . A Letter is ever the best and most powerful Agent to a Mistress , it almost always persuades , ‘ tis always renewing little Impressions , that possibly otherwise Absence would deface . Make use then , Damon , of your Time while it is given you , and thank me that I permit you to write to me : Perhaps I shall not always continue in the Humour of suffering you to do so ; and it may so happen , by some turn of Chance and Fortune , that you may be deprived , at the same time , both of my Presence , and of the Means of sending to me . I will believe that such an Accident would be a great Misfortune to you , for I have often heard you say , that , ‘ To make the most happy Lover suffer Martyrdom , one need only forbid him Seeing , Speaking and Writing to the Object he loves . ’ Take all the Advantages then you can , you cannot give me too often Marks too powerful of your Passion : Write therefore during this Hour , every Day . I give you leave to believe , that while you do so , you are serving me the most obligingly and agreeably you can , while absent ; and that you are giving me a Remedy against all Grief , Uneasiness , Melancholy , and Despair ; nay , if you exceed your Hour , you need not be asham 'd . The Time you employ in this kind Devoir , is the Time that I shall be grateful for , and no doubt will recompense it . You ought not however to neglect Heaven for me ; I will give you time for your Devotion , for my Watch tells you ‘ tis time to go to the Temple .</p>
   <p>TWELVE o'CLOCK .</p>
   <p>Indispensible Duty .</p>
   <p>There are certain Duties which one ought never to neglect : That of adoring the Gods is of this nature ; and which we ought to pay , from the bottom of our Hearts : And that , Damon , is the only time I will dispense with your not thinking on me . But I would not have you go to one of those Temples , where the celebrated Beauties , and those that make a profession of Gallantry , go ; and who come thither only to see , and be seen ; and whither they repair , more to shew their Beauty and Dress , than to honour the Gods . If you will take my advice , and oblige my wish , you shall go to those that are least frequented , and you shall appear there like a Man that has a perfect Veneration for all things Sacred .</p>

   <p>This sort of Creature , Damon , is very dangerous ; not that I fear you will squander away a Heart upon her , but your Hours ; for in spight of you , she 'll detain you with a thousand Impertinencies , and eternal Tattle . She passes for a judging Wit ; and there is nothing so troublesome as such a Pretender . She , perhaps , may get some knowledge of our Correspondence ; and then , no doubt , will improve it to my Disadvantage . Possibly she may rail at me ; that is her fashion by the way of friendly Speaking ; and an aukward Commendation , the most effectual way of Defaming and Traducing . Perhaps she tells you , in a cold Tone , that you are a happy Man to be belov 'd by me : That Iris indeed is handsome , and she wonders she has no more Lovers ; but the Men are not of her mind ; if they were , you should have more Rivals . She commends my Face , but that I have blue Eyes , and ‘ tis pity my Complexion is no better : My Shape but too much inclining to fat . Cries — She would charm infinitely with her Wit , but that she knows too well she is Mistress of it . And concludes ,— But all together she is well enough .— Thus she runs on without giving you leave to edge in a word in my defence ; and ever and anon crying up her own Conduct and Management : Tells you how she is opprest with Lovers , and fatigu 'd with Addresses ; and recommending her self , at every turn , with a perceivable Cunning : And all the while is jilting you of your good Opinion ; which she would buy at the price of any body 's Repose , or her own Fame , tho ’ but for the Vanity of adding to the number of her Lovers . When she sees a new Spark , the first thing she does , she enquires into his Estate ; if she find it such as may ( if the Coxcomb be well manag 'd ) supply her Vanity , she makes advances to him , and applies her self to those little Arts she usually makes use of to gain her Fools ; and according to his Humour dresses and affects her own . But , Damon , since I point to no particular Person in this Character , I will not name who you shall avoid ; but all of this sort I conjure you , wheresoever you find ‘ em . But if unlucky Chance throw you in their way , hear all they say , without credit or regard , as far as Decency will suffer you ; hear ‘ em without approving their Foppery ; and hear ‘ em without giving ‘ em cause to censure you . But ‘ tis so much Time lost to listen to all the Novels this sort of People will perplex you with ; whose Business is to be idle , and who even tire themselves with their own Impertinencies . And be assur 'd after all there is nothing they can tell you that is worth your knowing . And Damon , a perfect Lover never asks any News but of the Maid he loves .</p>

   <p>Leave all those fond Entertainments , or you will disoblige me , and make Dinner wait for you ; for my Cupid tells you ‘ tis that Hour . Love does not pretend to make you lose that ; nor is it my Province to order you your Diet . Here I give you a perfect Liberty to do what you please ; and possibly , ‘ tis the only Hour in the whole four and twenty that I will absolutely resign you , or dispense with your even so much as thinking on me . ‘ Tis true , in seating your self at Table , I would not have you placed over-against a very beautiful Object ; for in such a one there are a thousand little Graces in Speaking , Looking , and Laughing that fail not to charm , if one gives way to the Eyes , to gaze and wander that way ; in which , perhaps , in spight of you , you will find a Pleasure : And while you do so , tho ’ without design or concern , you give the fair Charmer a sort of Vanity , in believing you have placed your self there , only for the advantage of looking on her ; and she assumes a hundred little Graces and Affectations which are not natural to her , to compleat a Conquest , which she believes so well begun already . She softens her Eyes , and sweetens her Mouth ; and in fine , puts on another Air than when she had no Design , and when you did not , by your continual looking on her , rouze her Vanity , and encrease her easy Opinion of her own Charms . Perhaps she knows I have some Interest in your Heart , and prides her self , at least , with believing she has attracted the Eyes of my Lover , if not his Heart ; and thinks it easy to vanquish the whole , if she pleases ; and triumphs over me in her secret Imaginations . Remember , Damon , that while you act thus in the Company and Conversation of other Beauties , every Look or Word you give in favour of ‘ em , is an Indignity to my Reputation ; and which you cannot suffer if you love me truly , and with Honour : and assure your self , so much Vanity as you inspire in her , so much Fame you rob me of ; for whatever Praises you give another Beauty , so much you take away from mine . Therefore , if you dine in Company , do as others do : Be generally civil , not applying your self by Words or Looks to any particular Person : Be as gay as you please : Talk and laugh with all , for this is not the Hour for Chagrin .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Damon , my Watch is juster than you imagine ; it would not have you live retired and solitary , but permits you to go and make Visits . I am not one of those that believe Love and Friendship cannot find a place in one and the same Heart : And that Man would be very unhappy , who , as soon as he had a Mistress , should be obliged to renounce the Society of his Friends . I must confess , I would not that you should have so much Concern for them , as you have for me ; for I have heard a sort of a Proverb that says , He cannot be very fervent in Love , who is not a little cold in Friendship . You are not ignorant , that when Love establishes himself in a Heart , he reigns a Tyrant there , and will not suffer even Friendship , if it pretend to share his Empire there .</p>
   <p>Cupid .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Love is a God , whose charming Sway</l>
     <l n="2">Both Heaven , and Earth , and Seas obey ;</l>
     <l n="3">A Power that will not mingled be</l>
     <l n="4">With any dull Equality .</l>
     <l n="5">Since first from Heaven , which gave him Birth ,</l>
     <l n="6">He rul 'd the Empire of the Earth ;</l>
     <l n="7">Jealous of Sov'reign Pow'r he rules ,</l>
     <l n="8">And will be absolute in Souls .</l>

   <p>I should be very angry if you had any of those Friendships which one ought to desire in a Mistress only ; for many times it happens that you have Sentiments a little too tender for those amiable Persons ; and many times Love and Friendship are so confounded together , that one cannot easily discern one from the other . I have seen a Man flatter himself with an Opinion , that he had but an Esteem for a Woman , when by some turn of Fortune in her Life , as marrying , or receiving the Addresses of Men , he has found by Spite and Jealousies within , that that was Love , which he before took for Complaisance or Friendship . Therefore have a care , for such Amities are dangerous : Not but that a Lover may have fair and generous Female Friends , whom he ought to visit ; and perhaps I should esteem you less , if I did not believe you were valued by such , if I were perfectly assured they were Friends and not Lovers . But have a care you hide not a Mistress under this Veil , or that you gain not a Lover by this Pretence : For you may begin with Friendship , and end with Love ; and I should be equally afflicted should you give it or receive it . And though you charge our Sex with all the Vanity , yet I often find Nature to have given you as large a Portion of that common Crime , which you would shuffle off , as asham 'd to own ; and are as fond and vain of the Imagination of a Conquest , as any Coquet of us all : tho ’ at the same time you despise the Victim , you think it adds a Trophy to your Fame . And I have seen a Man dress , and trick , and adjust his Looks and Mein , to make a Visit to a Woman he lov 'd not , nor ever could love , as for those he made to his Mistress ; and only for the Vanity of making a Conquest upon a Heart , even unworthy of the little Pains he has taken about it . And what is this but buying Vanity at the Expense of Sense and Ease ; and with Fatigue to purchase the Name of a conceited Fop , besides that of a dishonest Man ? For he who takes pains to make himself beloved , only to please his curious Humour , tho ’ he should say nothing that tends to it , more than by his Looks , his Sighs , and now and then breaking into Praises and Commendations of the Object ; by the care he takes , to appear well drest before her , and in good order ; he lyes in his Looks , he deceives with his Mein and Fashion , and cheats with every Motion , and every Grace he puts on : He cozens when he sings or dances ; he dissembles when he sighs ; and every thing he does , that wilfully gains upon her , is Malice prepense , Baseness , and Art below a Man of Sense or Virtue : and yet these Arts , these Cozenages , are the Common Practices of the Town . What 's this but that damnable Vice , of which they so reproach our Sex ; that of jilting for Hearts ? And ‘ tis in vain that my Lover , after such foul Play , shall think to appease me , with saying , He did it to try how easy he could conquer , and of how great force his Charms were : And why should I be angry if all the Town loved him , since he loved none but Iris ? Oh foolish Pleasure ! How little Sense goes to the making of such a Happiness ! And how little Love must he have for one particular Person , who would wish to inspire it into all the World , and yet himself pretend to be insensible ! But this , Damon , is rather what is but too much practiced by your Sex , than any Guilt I charge on you : tho ’ Vanity be an Ingredient that Nature very seldom omits in the Composition of either Sex ; and you may be allowed a Tincture of it at least . And , perhaps , I am not wholly exempt from this Leaven in my Nature , but accuse myself sometimes of finding a secret Joy of being ador 'd , tho ’ I even hate my Worshipper . But if any such Pleasure touch my Heart , I find it at the same time blushing in my Cheeks with a guilty Shame , which soon checks the petty Triumphs ; and I have a Virtue at soberer Thoughts , that I find surmounts my Weakness and Indiscretion ; and I hope Damon finds the same : For , should he have any of those Attachments , I should have no pity for him .</p>

     <l n="20">General Conversation .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In this Visiting-Hour , many People will happen to meet at one and the same Time together , in a Place : And as you make not Visits to Friends , to be silent , you ought to enter into Conversation with ‘ em ; but those Conversations ought to be general , and of general things : for there is no necessity of making your Friend the Confident of your Amours . ‘ Twould infinitely displease me , to hear you have reveal 'd to them all that I have repos 'd in you ; tho ’ Secrets never so trivial , yet since utter 'd between Lovers , they deserve to be priz 'd at a higher rate : For what can shew a Heart more indifferent and indiscreet , than to declare in any fashion , or with Mirth , or Joy , the tender things a Mistress says to a Lover , and which possibly , related at second hand , bear not the same Sense , because they have not the same Sound and Air they had originally , when they came from the soft Heart of her , who sigh 'd ‘ em first to her lavish Lover ? Perhaps they are told again with Mirth , or Joy , unbecoming their Character and Business ; and then they lose their Graces : ( for Love is the most solemn thing in nature , and the most unsuiting with Gaiety . ) Perhaps the soft Expressions suit not so well the harsher Voice of the masculine Lover , whose Accents were not form 'd for so much Tenderness ; at least , not of that sort : for Words that have the same Meaning , are alter 'd from their Sense by the least tone or accent of the Voice ; and those proper and fitted to my Soul , are not , possibly , so to yours , though both have the same Efficacy upon us ; yours upon my Heart , as mine upon yours : and both will be misunderstood by the unjudging World . Beside this , there is a Holiness in Love that 's true , that ought not to be profan 'd : And as the Poet truly says , at the latter end of an Ode , of which I will recite the whole ;</p>
   <p>The Invitation .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Aminta , fear not to confess</l>
     <l n="2">The charming Secret of thy Tenderness :</l>
     <l n="3">That which a Lover can n't conceal ,</l>
     <l n="4">That which , to me , thou shouldst reveal ;</l>
     <l n="5">And is but what thy lovely Eyes express .</l>
     <l n="6">Come , whisper to my panting Heart ,</l>
     <l n="7">That heaves and meets thy Voice half-way ;</l>
     <l n="8">That guesses what thou wouldst impart ,</l>
     <l n="9">And languishes for what thou hast to say .</l>
     <l n="10">Confirm my trembling Doubt , and make me know ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whence all these Blessings , and these Sighings flow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">Why dost thou scruple to unfold</l>
     <l n="13">A Mystery that does my Life concern ?</l>
     <l n="14">If thou ne'er speakst , it will be told ;</l>
     <l n="15">For Lovers all things can discern .</l>
     <l n="16">From overy Look , from every bashful Grace ,</l>
     <l n="17">That still succeed each other in thy Face ,</l>
     <l n="18">I shall the dear transporting Secret learn :</l>
     <l n="19">But ‘ tis a Pleasure not to be exprest , }</l>
     <l n="20">To hear it by the Voice confest , }</l>
     <l n="21">When soft Sighs breath it on my panting Breast . }</l>
     <l n="22">All calm and silent is the Grove ,</l>
     <l n="23">Whose shading Boughs resist the Day ;</l>
     <l n="24">Here thou mayst blush , and talk of Love ,</l>
     <l n="25">While only Winds , unheeding , stay ,</l>
     <l n="26">That will not bear the Sound away :</l>
     <l n="27">While I with solemn awful Joy ,</l>
     <l n="28">All my attentive Faculties employ ;</l>
     <l n="29">List'ning to every valu 'd Word ;</l>
     <l n="30">And in my Soul the secret Treasure hoard :</l>
     <l n="31">There like some Mystery Divine ,</l>
     <l n="32">The wond'rous Knowledge I 'll enshrine .</l>
     <l n="33">Love can his Joys no longer call his own ,</l>
     <l n="34">Than the dear Secret 's kept unknown .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There is nothing more true than those two last Lines : and that Love ceases to be a Pleasure , when it ceases to be a Secret , and one you ought to keep sacred : For the World , which never makes a right Judgment of things , will misinterpret Love , as they do Religion ; every one judging it , according to the Notion he has of it , or the Talent of his Sense . Love ( as a great Duke said ) is like Apparitions ; every one talks of them , but few have seen ‘ em : Every body thinks himself capable of understanding Love , and that he is a Master in the Art of it ; when there is nothing so nice , or difficult , to be rightly comprehended ; and indeed cannot be , but to a Soul very delicate . Nor will he make himself known to the Vulgar : There must be an uncommon Fineness in the Mind that contains him ; the rest he only visits in as many Disguises as there are Dispositions and Natures , where he makes but a short stay , and is gone . He can fit himself to all Hearts , being the greatest Flatterer in the World : And he possesses every one with a Confidence , that they are in the number of his Elect ; and they think they know him perfectly , when nothing but the Spirits refined possess him in his Excellency . From this difference of Love , in different Souls , proceed those odd fantastick Maxims , which so many hold of so different kinds : And this makes the most innocent Pleasures pass oftentimes for Crimes , with the unjudging Croud , who call themselves Lovers : And you will have your Passion censur 'd by as many as you shall discover it to , and as many several ways . I advise you therefore , Damon , to make no Confidents of your Amours ; and believe , that Silence has , with me , the most powerful Charm .</p>
   <p>‘ Tis also in these Conversations , that those indiscreetly civil Persons often are , who think to oblige a good Man , by letting him know he is belov 'd by some one or other ; and making him understand how many good Qualities he is Master of , to render him agreeable to the Fair Sex , if he would but advance where Love and good Fortune call ; and that a too constant Lover loses a great part of his Time , which might be manag 'd to more advantage , since Youth hath so short a Race to run . This , and a thousand the like indecent Complaisances , give him a Vanity that suits not with that Discretion , which has hitherto acquir 'd him so good a Reputation . I would not have you , Damon , act on these occasions , as many of the easy Sparks have done before you , who receive such Weakness and Flattery for Truth ; and passing it off with a Smile , suffer ‘ em to advance in Folly , till they have gain 'd a Credit with ‘ em , and they believe all they hear ; telling ‘ em they do so , by consenting Gestures , Silence , or open Approbation . For my part , I should not condemn a Lover that should answer such a sort of civil Brokers for Love , somewhat briskly ; and by giving ‘ em to understand they are already engag 'd , or directing ‘ em to Fools , that will possibly hearken to ‘ em , and credit such Stuff , shame ‘ em out of a Folly so infamous and disingenuous . In such a Case only I am willing you should own your Passion ; not that you need tell the Object which has charm 'd you : And you may say , you are already a Lover , without saying you are belov 'd . For so long as you appear to have a Heart unengag 'd , you are expos 'd to all the little Arts and and Addresses of this sort of obliging Procurers of Love , and give way to the hope they have of making you their Proselyte . For your own Reputation then , and my Ease and Honour , shun such Conversations ; for they are neither creditable to you , nor pleasing to me : And believe me , Damon , a true Lover has no Curiosity , but what concerns his Mistress .</p>
   <p>FIVE o'CLOCK .</p>
   <p>Dangerous Visits .</p>
   <p>I foresee , or fear , that these busy impertinent Friends will oblige you to visit some Ladies of their Acquaintance , or yours ; my Watch does not forbid you . Yet I must tell you , I apprehend Danger in such Visits ; and I fear , you will have need of all your Care and Precaution , in these Encounters . That you may give me no cause to suspect you , perhaps you will argue , that Civility obliges you to it . If I were assur 'd there would no other Design be carried on , I should believe it were to advance an amorous Prudence too far , to forbid you . Only keep yourself upon your guard ; for the Business of most part of the Fair Sex , is , to seek only the Conquest of Hearts : All their Civilities are but so many Interests ; and they do nothing without Design . And in such Conversations there is always a Je ne scay quoy , that is fear 'd , especially when Beauty is accompanied with Youth and Gaiety ; and which they assume upon all occasions that may serve their turn . And I confess , ‘ tis not an easy matter to be just in these Hours and Conversations : The most certain way of being so , is to imagine I read all your Thoughts , observe all your Looks , and hear all your Words .</p>
   <p>The Caution .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My Damon , if your Heart be kind ,</l>
     <l n="2">Do not too long with Beauty stay ;</l>
     <l n="3">For there are certain Moments when the Mind</l>
     <l n="4">Is hurry 'd by the Force of Charms away .</l>
     <l n="5">In Fate a Minute critical there lies ,</l>
     <l n="6">That waits on Love , and takes you by Surprize .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">A Lover pleas 'd with Constancy ,</l>
     <l n="8">Lives still as if the Maid he lov 'd were by :</l>
     <l n="9">As if his Actions were in view ,</l>
     <l n="10">As if his Steps she did pursue ;</l>
     <l n="11">Or that his very Soul she knew .</l>
     <l n="12">Take heed ; for though I am not present there ,</l>
     <l n="13">My Love , my Genius waits you every where .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I am very much pleas 'd with the Remedy , you say , you make use of to defend your self from the Attacks that Beauty gives your Heart ; which in one of your Billets , you said was this , or to this purpose :</p>
   <p>The Charm for Constancy .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Iris , to keep my Soul entire and true ,</l>
     <l n="2">It thinks , each Moment of the Day , on you .</l>
     <l n="3">And when a charming Face I see ,</l>
     <l n="4">That does all other Eyes incline ,</l>
     <l n="5">It has no Influence on me :</l>
     <l n="6">I think it ev'n deform 'd to thine .</l>
     <l n="7">My Eyes , my Soul , and Sense , regardless move</l>
     <l n="8">To all , but the dear Object of my Love .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But , Damon , I know all Lovers are naturally Flatterers , tho ’ they do not think so themselves ; because every one makes a Sense of Beauty according to his own Fancy . But perhaps you will say in your own defence , That ‘ tis not Flattery to say an unbeautiful Woman is beautiful , if he that says so believes she is so . I should be content to acquit you of the first , provided you allow me the last : And if I appear charming in Damon 's eyes , I am not fond of the Approbation of any other . ‘ Tis enough the World thinks me not altogether disagreeable , to justify his Choice ; but let your good Opinion give what Increase it pleases to my Beauty , tho ’ your Approbation give me a Pleasure , it shall not a Vanity ; and I am contented that Damon should think me a Beauty , without my believing I am one . ‘ Tis not to draw new Assurances , and new Vows from you , that I speak this ; though Tales of Love are the only ones we desire to hear often told , and which never tire the Hearers if addrest to themselves . But ‘ tis not to this end I now seem to doubt what you say to my advantage : No , my Heart knows no Disguise , nor can dissemble one Thought of it to Damon ; ‘ tis all sincere , and honest as his Wish : ‘ Tis therefore it tells you , it does not credit every thing you say ; tho ’ I believe you say abundance of Truths in a great part of my Character . But when you advance to that , which my own Sense , my Judgment , or my Glass cannot persuade me to believe , you must give me leave either to believe you think me vain enough to credit you , or pleas 'd that your Sentiments and mine are differing in this point . But I doubt I may rather reply in some Verses , a Friend of yours and mine sent to a Person she thought had but indifferent Sentiments for her ; yet , who nevertheless flatter 'd her , because he imagin 'd she had a very great Esteem for him . She is a Woman that , you know , naturally hates Flattery : On the other side she was extremely dissatisfy 'd , and uneasy at his Opinion of his being more in her favour than she desir 'd he should believe . So that one Night having left her full of Pride and Anger , she next Morning sent him these Verses , instead of a Billetdoux .</p>

   <p>Possibly , the angry Aminta , when she writ these Verses , was more offended , that he believed himself belov 'd , than that he flatter 'd ; tho ’ she wou 'd seem to make that a great part of the Quarrel , and Cause of her Resentment : For we are often in an humour to seem more modest in that point , than naturally we are ; being too apt to have a favourable Opinion of our selves : And ‘ tis rather the Effects of a Fear that we are flatter 'd , than our own ill Opinion of the Beauty flatter 'd ; and that the Praiser thinks not so well of it , as we do our selves , or at least we wish he should . Not but there are Grains of Allowance for the Temper of him that speaks : One Man 's Humour is to talk much ; and he may be permitted to enlarge upon the Praise he gives the Person he pretends to , without being accus 'd of much Guilt . Another hates to be wordy ; from such an one , I have known one soft Expression , one tender Thing , go as far as whole Days everlasting Protestations urged with Vows , and mighty Eloquence . And both the one and the other , indeed , must be allow 'd in good manners , to stretch the Compliment beyond the bounds of nice Truth : and we must not wonder to hear a Man call a Woman a Beauty , when she is not ugly ; or another a great Wit , if she have but common Sense above the Vulgar ; well bred , when well drest ; and good-natur 'd , when civil . And as I should be very ridiculous , if I took all you said for absolute Truth ; so I should be very unjust , not to allow you very sincere in almost all you said besides ; and those things , the most material to Love , Honour and Friendship . And for the rest ( Damon ) be it true or false , this believe , you speak with such a Grace , that I cannot chuse but credit you ; and find an infinite Pleasure in that Faith , because I love you : And if I cannot find the Cheat , I am contented you should deceive me on , because you do it so agreeably .</p>
   <p>SIX o'CLOCK .</p>
   <p>Walk without Design .</p>
   <p>You yet have time to walk ; and my Watch foresaw you cou 'd not refuse your Friends . You must to the Park , or to the Mall ; for the Season is fair and inviting , and all the young Beauties love those Places too well , not to be there . ‘ Tis there that a thousand Intrigues are carry 'd on , and as many more design 'd : ‘ Tis there that every one is set out for Conquest ; and who aim at nothing less than Hearts . Guard yours well , my Damon ; and be not always admiring what you see . Do not , in passing by , sigh them silent Praises . Suffer not so much as a guilty Wish to approach your Thoughts , nor a heedful Glance to steal from your fine Eyes : Those are Regards you ought only to have for her you love . But oh ! above all , have a care of what you say : You are not reproachable , if you should remain silent all the time of your Walk ; nor would those that know you believe it the Effects of Dulness , but Melancholy . And if any of your Friends ask you , Why you are so ? I will give you leave to sigh , and say —</p>

   <p>I do not , for all this , wholly confine your Eyes : you may look indifferently on all , but with a particular regard on none . You may praise all the Beauties in general , but no single one too much . I will not exact from you neither an intire Silence : There are a thousand Civilities you ought to pay to all your Friends and Acquaintance ; and while I caution you of Actions , that may get you the Reputation of a Lover of some of the Fair that haunt those Places , I would not have you , by an unnecessary and uncomplaisant Sullenness , gain that of a Person too negligent or morose . I would have you remiss in no one Punctilio of good Manners . I would have you very just , and pay all you owe ; but in these Affairs be not over generous , and give away too much . In fine , you may look , speak and walk ; but ( Damon ) do it all without design : And while you do so , remember that Iris sent you this Advice .</p>

   <p>Voluntary Retreat .</p>
   <p>‘ Tis time to be weary , ‘ tis Night : Take leave of your Friends and retire home . ‘ Tis in this Retreat that you ought to recollect in your Thoughts all the Actions of the Day , and all those things that you ought to give me an account of , in your Letter : You cannot hide the least Secret from me , without Treason against sacred Love . For all the World agrees that Confidence is one of the greatest Proofs of the Passion of Love ; and that Lover who refuses his Confidence to the Person he loves , is to be suspected to love but very indifferently , and to think very poorly of the Sense and Generosity of his Mistress . But that you may acquit your self like a Man , and a Lover of Honour , and leave me no doubt upon my Soul ; think of all you have done this day , that I may have all the Story of it in your next Letter to me : but deal faithfully , and neither add nor diminish in your Relation ; the Truth and Sincerity of your Confession will atone even for little Faults that you shall commit against me , in some of those things you shall tell me . For if you have fail 'd in any Point or Circumstance of Love , I had much rather hear it from you than another : for ‘ tis a sort of Repentance to accuse your self ; and would be a Crime unpardonable , if you suffer me to hear it from any other : And be assur 'd , while you confess it , I shall be indulgent enough to forgive you . The noblest Quality of Man is Sincerity ; and ( Damon ) one ought to have as much of it in Love , as in any other Business of one 's Life , notwithstanding the most part of Men make no account of it there ; but will believe there ought to be Double-dealing , and an Art practised in Love as well as in War .

   <p>After you have sufficiently recollected your self of all the past Actions of the Day , call your Page into your Cabinet , or him whom you trusted with your last Letter to me ; where you ought to enquire of him a thousand things , and all of me . Ask impatiently , and be angry if he answers not your Curiosity soon enough : Think that he has a dreaming in his Voice , in these moments more than at other times ; and reproach him with Dulness : For ‘ tis most certain that when one loves tenderly , we would know in a minute , what cannot be related in an hour . Ask him , How I did ? How I receiv 'd his Letter ? And if he examined the Air of my Face , when I took it ? If I blush 'd or looked pale ? If my Hand trembled , or I spoke to him with short interrupting Sighs ? If I asked him any Questions about you , while I was opening the Seal ? Or if I could not well speak , and was silent ? If I read it attentively , and with Joy ? And all this , before you open the Answer I have sent you by him : which , because you are impatient to read , you , with the more haste and earnestness , demand all you expect from him ; and that you may the better know what Humour I was in , when I writ that to you : For , Oh ! a Lover has a thousand little Fears , and Dreads , he knows not why . In fine , make him recount to you all that past , while he was with me ; and then you ought to read that which I have sent , that you may inform your self of all that passes in my Heart : for you may assure your self , all that I say to you that way proceeds from thence .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>You will not have much trouble to explain what my Watch designs here . There can be no Thought more afflicting , than that of the Absence of a Mistress ; and which the Sighings of the Heart will soon make you find . Ten thousand Fears oppress him ; he is jealous of every body , and envies those Eyes and Ears that are charmed by being near the Object ador 'd . He grows impatient , and makes a thousand Resolutions , and as soon abandons them all . He gives himself wholly up to the Torment of Incertainty ; and by degrees , from one cruel Thought to another , winds himself up to insupportable Chagrin . Take this Hour then , to think on your Misfortunes , which cannot be small to a Soul that is wholly sensible of Love . And every one knows , that a Lover , deprived of the Object of his Heart , is deprived of all the World , and inconsolable : For tho ’ one wishes without ceasing for the dear Charmer one loves , and tho ’ you speak of her every minute ; and tho ’ you are writing to her every day , and tho ’ you are infinitely pleas 'd with the dear and tender Answers ; yet , to speak sincerely , it must be confessed , that the Felicity of a true Lover is to be always near his Mistress . And you may tell me , O Damon ! what you please ; and say that Absence inspires the Flame , which perpetual Presence would satiate : I love too well to be of that mind , and when I am , I shall believe my Passion is declining . I know not whether it advances your Love ; but surely it must ruin your Repose : And it is impossible to be , at once , an absent Lover , and happy too . For my part , I can meet with nothing that can please in the absence of Damon ; but on the contrary I see all things with disgust . I will flatter my self , that ‘ tis so with you ; and that the least Evils appear great Misfortunes ; and that all those who speak to you of any thing but of what you love , increase your Pain , by a new remembrance of her Absence . I will believe that these are your Sentiments , when you are assur 'd not to see me in some weeks ; and if your Heart do not betray your Words , all those days will be tedious to you . I would not , however , have your Melancholy too extreme ; and to lessen it , you may persuade your self , that I partake it with you : for , I remember , in your last you told me , you would wish we should be both griev 'd at the same time , and both at the same time pleas 'd ; and I believe I love too well not to obey you .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>After the afflicting Thoughts of my Absence , make some Reflections on your Happiness . Think it a Blessing to be permitted to love me ; think it so , because I permit it to you alone , and never could be drawn to allow it any other . The first thing you ought to consider , is , that at length I have suffer 'd my self to be overcome , to quit that Nicety that is natural to me , and receive your Addresses ; nay , thought ‘ em agreeable : and that I have at last confess 'd , the Present of your Heart is very dear to me . ‘ Tis true , I did not accept of it the first time it was offer 'd me , nor before you had told me a thousand times , that you could not escape expiring , if I did not give you leave to sigh for me , and gaze upon me ; and that there was an absolute necessity for me , either to give you leave to love , or die . And all those Rigours my Severity has made you suffer , ought now to be recounted to your Memory , as Subjects of Pleasure ; and you ought to esteem and judge of the Price of my Affections , by the Difficulties you found in being able to touch my Heart : Not but you have Charms that can conquer at first sight ; and you ought not to have valu 'd me less , if I had been more easily gain 'd : But ‘ tis enough to please you , to think and know I am gain 'd ; no matter when and how . When , after a thousand Cares and Inquietudes , that which we wish for succeeds to our Desires , the remembrance of those Pains and Pleasures we encounter 'd in arriving at it , gives us a new Joy .</p>
   <p>Remember also , Damon , that I have preferred you before all those that have been thought worthy of my Esteem ; and that I have shut my Eyes to all their pleading Merits , and could survey none but yours .</p>
   <p>Consider then , that you had not only the Happiness to please me , but that you only found out the way of doing it , and I had the Goodness at last to tell you so , contrary to all the Delicacy and Niceness of my Soul , contrary to my Prudence , and all those Scruples , you know , are natural to my Humour .</p>
   <p>My Tenderness proceeded further , and I gave you innocent Marks of my new-born Passion , on all occasions that presented themselves : For , after that from my Eyes and Tongue you knew the Sentiments of my Heart , I confirm 'd that Truth to you by my Letters . Confess , Damon , that if you make these Reflections , you will not pass this Hour very disagreeably .</p>

     <l n="29">I trembled when my Hand you press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nor cou 'd my Guilt controul ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">And when upon the giving part ,</l>

     <l n="39">I gave my Soul the noblest way ,</l>
     <l n="40">My Letters made it good .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>You may believe I did not easily , nor suddenly , bring my Heart to this Condescension ; but I lov 'd , and all things in Damon were capable of making me resolve so to do . I could not think it a Crime , where every Grace , and every Virtue justified my Choice : And when once one is assured of this , we find not much difficulty in owning that Passion which will so well commend one 's Judgment ; and there is no Obstacle that Love does not surmount . I confess 'd my Weakness a thousand ways , before I told it you ; and I remember all those things with Pleasure , but yet I remember ‘ em also with Shame .</p>
   <p>ELEVEN o'CLOCK .</p>
   <p>Supper .</p>
   <p>I Will believe , Damon , that you have been so well entertained during this Hour , and have found so much Sweetness in these Thoughts , that if one did not tell you that Supper waits , you would lose your self in Reflections so pleasing , many more Minutes . But you must go where you are expected ; perhaps , among the fair , the young , the gay ; but do not abandon your Heart to too much Joy , tho ’ you have so much reason to be contented : but the greatest Pleasures are always imperfect , if the Object belov 'd do not partake of it . For this reason be chearful and merry with reserve : Do not talk too much , I know you do not love it ; and if you do it , ‘ twill be the effect of too much Complaisance , or with some design of pleasing too well ; for you know your own charming Power , and how agreeable your Wit and Conversation are to all the World . Remember , I am covetous of every Word you speak , that is not address 'd to me , and envy the happy list'ner , if I am not by . And I may reply to you as Aminta did to Philander , when he charged her of loving a Talker : and because , perhaps , you have not heard it , I will , to divert you , send it to you ; and at the same time assure you , Damon , that your more noble Quality , of speaking little , has reduc 'd me to a perfect Abhorrence of those wordy Sparks , that value themselves upon their ready and much talking upon every trivial Subject , and who have so good an Opinion of their Talent that way , they will let no body edge in a word , or a reply ; but will make all the Conversation themselves , that they may pass for very entertaining Persons , and pure Company .

If all Women were like me , I should have more reason to fear your Silence than your Talk : for you have a thousand ways to charm without speaking , and those which to me shew a great deal more Concern . But , Damon , you know the greatest part of my Sex judge the fine Gentleman by the Volubility of his Tongue , by his Dexterity in Repartee , and cry — Oh ! he never wants fine things to say : He 's eternally talking the most surprizing things . But , Damon , you are well assur 'd , I hope , that Iris is none of these Coquets : at least , if she had any spark of it once in her Nature , she is by the excellency of your contrary Temper taught to know , and scorn the folly : And take heed your Conduct never give me cause to suspect you have deceiv 'd me in your Temper .</p>
   <p>TWELVE o'CLOCK .</p>
   <p>Complaisance .</p>
   <p>Nevertheless , Damon , Civility requires a little Complaisance after Supper ; and I am assur 'd , you can never want that , tho ’ I confess , you are not accus 'd of too general a Complaisance , and do not often make use of it to those Persons you have an Indifference for : tho ’ one is not the less esteemable for having more of this than one ought : and tho ’ an excess of it be a Fault , ‘ tis a very excusable one . Have therefore some for those with whom you are : You may laugh with ‘ em , drink with ‘ em , dance or sing with ‘ em ; yet think of me . You may discourse of a thousand indifferent things with ‘ em ; and at the same time still think of me . If the Subject be any beautiful Lady , whom they praise , either for her Person , Wit , or Virtue , you may apply it to me : And if you dare not say it aloud , at least , let your Heart answer in this language :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Yes , the fair Object , whom you praise ,</l>
     <l n="2">Can give us Love a thousand ways ;</l>
     <l n="3">Her Wit and Beauty charming are ;</l>
     <l n="4">But still my Iris is more fair .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>No body ever spoke before me of a faithful Lover , but still I sigh 'd , and thought of Damon : And ever when they tell me Tales of Love , any soft pleasing Intercourses of an Amour ; Oh ! with what Pleasures do I listen ! and with Pleasure answer ‘ em , either with my Eyes , or Tongue —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">That Lover may his Sylvia warm ,</l>
     <l n="2">But cannot , like my Damon , charm .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If I have not all those excellent Qualities you meet with in those beautiful People , I am however very glad that Love prepossesses your Heart to my advantage : And I need not tell you , Damon , that a true Lover ought to persuade himself , that all other Objects ought to give place to her , for whom his Heart sighs — But see , my Cupid tells you ‘ tis One o'Clock , and that you ought not to be longer from your Apartment ; where , while you are undressing , I will give you leave to say to your self —</p>

     <l n="19">Impossibility to Sleep .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>You have been up long enough ; and Cupid , who takes care of your Health , tells you , ‘ tis time for you to go to bed . Perhaps you may not sleep as soon as you are laid , and possibly you may pass an Hour in Bed , before you shut your Eyes . In this impossibility of sleeping , I think it very proper for you to imagine what I am doing where I am . Let your Fancy take a little Journey then , invisible , to observe my Actions and my Conduct . You will find me sitting alone in my Cabinet ( for I am one that do not love to go to bed early ) and will find me very uneasy and pensive , pleas 'd with none of those things that so well entertain others . I shun all Conversation , as far as Civility will allow , and find no Satisfaction like being alone , where my Soul may , without interruption , converse with Damon . I sigh , and sometimes you will see my Cheeks wet with Tears , that insensibly glide down at a thousand Thoughts that present themselves soft and afflicting . I partake of all your Inquietude . On other things I think with indifference , if ever my Thoughts do stray from the more agreeable Object . I find , however , a little Sweetness in this Thought , that , during my Absence , your Heart thinks of me , when mine sighs for you . Perhaps I am mistaken , and that at the same time that you are the Entertainment of all my Thoughts , I am no more in yours ; and perhaps you are thinking of those things that immortalize the Young and Brave , either by those Glories the Muses flatter you with , or that of Bellona , and the God of War ; and serving now a Monarch , whose glorious Acts in Arms has out-gone all the feign 'd and real Heroes of any Age , who has , himself , out-done whatever History can produce of great and brave , and set so illustrious an Example to the Under-World , that it is not impossible , as much a Lover as you are , but you are thinking now how to render your self worthy the Glory of such a God-like Master , by projecting a thousand things of Gallantry and Danger . And tho ’ , I confess , such Thoughts are proper for your Youth , your Quality , and the Place you have the honour to hold under our Sovereign , yet let me tell you , Damon , you will not be without Inquietude , if you think of either being a delicate Poet , or a brave Warrior ; for Love will still interrupt your Glory , however you may think to divert him either by writing or fighting . And you ought to remember these Verses :</p>

   <p>You see here that Poets and Warriors are oftentimes in affliction , even under the Shades of their protecting Laurels ; and let the Nymphs and Virgins sing what they please to their memory , under the Myrtles , and on flowery Beds , they are much better Days than in the Campagne . Nor do the Crowns of Glory surpass those of Love : The first is but an empty Name , which is won , kept and lost with Hazard ; but Love more nobly employs a brave Soul , and all his Pleasures are solid and lasting ; and when one has a worthy Object of one 's Flame , Glory accompanies Love too . But go to sleep , the Hour is come ; and ‘ tis now that your Soul ought to be entertain 'd in Dreams .</p>
   <p>TWO o'CLOCK .</p>
   <p>Conversation in Dreams .</p>
   <p>I doubt not but you will think it very bold and arbitrary , that my Watch should pretend to rule even your sleeping Hours , and that my Cupid should govern your very Dreams ; which are but Thoughts disordered , in which Reason has no part ; Chimera 's of the Imagination , and no more . But tho ’ my Watch does not pretend to Counsel unreasonably , yet you must allow it here , if not to pass the Bounds , at least to advance to the utmost Limits of it . I am assur 'd , that after having thought so much of me in the Day , you will think of me also in the Night . And the first Dream my Watch permits you to make , is to think you are in Conversation with me .</p>
   <p>Imagine , Damon , that you are talking to me of your Passion , with all the Transport of a Lover , and that I hear you with Satisfaction ; that all my Looks and Blushes , while you are speaking , give you new Hopes and Assurances ; that you are not indifferent to me ; and that I give you a thousand Testimonies of my Tenderness , all innocent and obliging .</p>
   <p>While you are saying all that Love can dictate , all that Wit and good Manners can invent , and all that I wish to hear from Damon , believe in this Dream , all flattering and dear , that after having shewed me the Ardour of your Flame , I confess to you the Bottom of my Heart , and all the loving Secrets there ; that I give you Sigh for Sigh , Tenderness for Tenderness , Heart for Heart , and Pleasure for Pleasure . And I would have your Sense of this Dream so perfect , and your Joy so entire , that if it happen you should awake with the Satisfaction of this Dream , you should find your Heart still panting with the soft Pleasure of the dear deceiving Transport , and you should be ready to cry out ,</p>

   <p>It is but just to mix a little Chagrin with these Pleasures , a little Bitter with your Sweet ; you may be cloy 'd with too long an Imagination of my Favours : and I will have your Fancy in Dreams represent me to it , as the most capricious Maid in the World . I know , here you will accuse my Watch , and blame me with unnecessary Cruelty , as you will call it : but Lovers have their little Ends , their little Advantages , to pursue by Methods wholly unaccountable to all , but that Heart which contrives ‘ em : And , as good a Lover as I believe you , you will not enter into my Design at first sight ; and tho ’ , on reasonable Thoughts , you will be satisfied with this Conduct of mine , at its first Approach you will be ready to cry out —</p>

   <p>Some such Complaint as this I know you will make ; but , Damon , if the little Quarrels of Lovers render the reconciling Moments so infinitely charming , you must needs allow , that these little Chagrin in capricious Dreams must awaken you to more Joy to find ‘ em but Dreams , than if you had met with no Disorder there . ‘ Tis for this reason that I would have you suffer a little Pain for a coming Pleasure ; nor , indeed is it possible for you to escape the Dreams my Cupid points you out . You shall dream that I have a thousand Foibles , something of the lightness of my Sex ; that my Soul is employ 'd in a thousand Vanities ; that ( proud and fond of Lovers ) I make advances for the Glory of a Slave , without any other Interest or Design than that of being ador 'd . I will give you leave to think my Heart fickle , and that , far from resigning it to any one , I lend it only for a Day , or an Hour , and take it back at pleasure ; that I am a very Coquet , even to Impertinence .</p>
   <p>All this I give you leave to think , and to offend me : but ‘ tis in sleep only that I permit it ; for I would never pardon you the least Offence of this nature , if in any other Kind than in a Dream . Nor is it enough Affliction to you , to imagine me thus idly vain ; but you are to pass on to a hundred more capricious Humours : as that I exact of you a hundred unjust Things ; that I pretend you should break off with all your Friends , and for the future have none at all ; that I will myself do those Things , which I violently condemn in you ; and that I will have for others , as well as you , that tender Friendship that resembles Love , or rather that Love which People call Friendship ; and that I will not , after all , have you dare complain on me .</p>
   <p>In fine , be as ingenious as you please to torment your self ; and believe , that I am become unjust , ungrateful , and insensible : But were I so indeed , O Damon ! consider your awaking Heart , and tell me , would your Love stand the proof of all these Faults in me ? But know , that I would have you believe I have none of these Weaknesses , tho ’ I am not wholly without Faults , but those will be excusable to a Lover ; and this Notion I have of a perfect one :</p>

   <p>Do not think , Damon , to wake yet ; for I design you shall yet suffer a little more : Jealousy must now possess you , that Tyrant over the Heart , that compels your very Reason , and seduces all your Good-Nature . And in this Dream you must believe That in sleeping , which you could not do me the injustice to do when awake . And here you must explain all my Actions to the utmost disadvantage : Nay , I will wish , that the Force of this Jealousy may be so extreme , that it may make you languish in Grief , and be overcome with Anger .</p>
   <p>You shall now imagine , that one of your Rivals is with me , interrupting all you say , or hindering all you would say ; that I have no Attention to what you say aloud to me , but that I incline mine Ear to hearken to all that he whispers to me . You shall repine , that he pursues me every where , and is eternally at your heels if you approach me ; that I caress him with Sweetness in my Eyes , and that Vanity in my Heart , that possesses the Humours of almost all the Fair ; that is , to believe it greatly for my Glory to have abundance of Rivals for my Lovers . I know you love me too well not to be extreamely uneasy in the Company of a Rival , and to have one perpetually near me ; for let him be belov 'd or not by the Mistress , it must be confess 'd , a Rival is a very troublesome Person . But , to afflict you to the utmost , I will have you imagine that my Eyes approve of all his Thoughts ; that they flatter him with Hopes ; and that I have taken away my Heart from you , to make a Present of it to this more lucky Man . You shall suffer , while possess 'd with this Dream , all that a cruel Jealousy can make a tender Soul suffer .</p>
   <p>The Torment .</p>

   <p>In fine , it is a Passion that ruffles all the Senses , and disorders the whole Frame of Nature .

   <p>Tho ’ the angry Lovers force themselves , all they can , to chase away the troublesom Tenderness of the Heart , in the height of their Quarrels , Love sees all their Sufferings , pities and redresses ‘ em : And when we begin to cool , and a soft Repentance follows the Chagrin of the Love-Quarrel , ‘ tis then that Love takes the advantage of both Hearts , and renews the charming Friendship more forcibly than ever , puts a stop to all our Feuds , and renders the peace-making Minutes the most dear and tender part of our Life . How pleasing ‘ tis to see your Rage dissolve ! How sweet , how soft is every Word that pleads for pardon at my Feet ! ‘ Tis there that you tell me , your very Sufferings are over paid , when I but assure you from my Eyes , that I will forget your Crime : And your Imagination shall here present me the most sensible of your past Pain , that you can wish ; and that all my Anger being vanisht , I give you a thousand Marks of my Faith and Gratitude ; and lastly , to crown all , that we again make new Vows to one another of inviolable Peace :</p>

   <p>Enjoy then all the Pleasures that a Heart that is very amorous , and very tender , can enjoy . Think no more on those Inquietudes that you have suffer 'd ; bless Love for his Favours , and thank me for my Graces : and resolve to endure any thing , rather than enter upon any new Quarrels . And however dear the reconciling Moments are , there proceeds a great deal of Evil from these little frequent Quarrels ; and I think the best Counsel we can follow , is to avoid ‘ em as near as we can : And if we cannot , but that , in spite of Love and good Understanding , they should break out , we ought to make as speedy a Peace as possible ; for ‘ tis not good to grate the Heart too long , lest it grow harden 'd insensibly , and lose its native Temper . A few Quarrels there must be in Love : Love cannot support it self without ‘ em : and , besides the Joy of an Accommodation , Love becomes by it more strongly united , and more charming . Therefore let the Lover receive this as a certain Receipt against declining Love :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Behold , Damon , the last Hour of your Sleep , and of my Watch . She leaves you at Liberty now , and you may chuse your Dreams : Trust ‘ em to your Imaginations , give a Loose to Fancy , and let it rove at will , provided , Damon , it be always guided by a respectful Love . For thus far I pretend to give bounds to your Imagination , and will not have it pass beyond ‘ em : Take heed , in sleeping , you give no ear to a flatt'ring Cupid , that will favour your slumb'ring Minutes with Lyes too pleasing and vain : You are discreet enough when you are awake ; will you not be so in Dreams ?</p>
   <p>Damon , awake ; my Watch 's Course is done : after this , you cannot be ignorant of what you ought to do during my Absence . I did not believe it necessary to caution you about Balls and Comedies ; you know , a Lover depriv 'd of his Mistress , goes seldom there . But if you cannot handsomely avoid these Diversions , I am not so unjust a Mistress , to be angry with you for it ; go , if Civility , or other Duties oblige you : I will only forbid you , in consideration of me , not to be too much satisfy 'd with those Pleasures ; but see ‘ em so , as the World may have reason to say , you do not seek them , you do not make a Business or Pleasure of them ; and that ‘ tis Complaisance , and not Inclination , that carries you thither . Seem rather negligent than concern 'd at any thing there ; and let every part of you say , Iris is not here —</p>
   <p>I say nothing to you neither of your Duty elsewhere ; I am satisfy 'd you know it too well ; and have too great a Veneration for your glorious Master , to neglect any part of that for even Love it self . And I very well know how much you love to be eternally near his illustrious Person ; and that you scarce prefer your Mistress before him , in point of Love : In all things else , I give him leave to take place of Iris in the noble Heart of Damon .</p>
   <p>I am satisfy 'd you pass your time well now at Windsor , for you adore that Place ; and ‘ tis not , indeed , without great reason : for ‘ tis most certainly now render 'd the most glorious Palace in the Christian World . And had our late Gracious Sovereign , of blessed Memory , had no other Miracles and Wonders of his Life and Reign to have immortaliz 'd his Fame ( of which there shall remain a thousand to Posterity ) this noble Structure alone , this Building ( almost Divine ) would have eterniz 'd the great Name of Glorious Charles II . till the World moulder again to its old Confusion , its first Chaos . And the Paintings of the famous Varrio , and noble Carvings of the unimitable Gibbon , shall never die , but remain to tell succeeding Ages , that all Arts and Learning were not confin 'd to antient Rome and Greece , but that England too could boast its mightiest Share . Nor is the Inside of this magnificent Structure , immortaliz 'd with so many eternal Images of the illustrious Charles and Katharine , more to be admired than the wondrous Prospects without . The stupendous Heighth , on which the famous Pile is built , renders the Fields , and flowery Meads below , the Woods , the Thickets , and the winding Streams , the most delightful Object that ever Nature produc 'd . Beyond all these , and far below , in an inviting Vale , the venerable College , an old , but noble Building , raises it self , in the midst of all the Beauties of Nature , high-grown Trees , fruitful Plains , purling Rivulets , and spacious Gardens , adorn 'd with all Variety of Sweets that can delight the Senses .</p>
   <p>At farther distance yet , on an Ascent almost as high as that to the Royal Structure , you may behold the famous and noble Clifdon rise , a Palace erected by the illustrious Duke of Buckingham , who will leave this wondrous Piece of Architecture , to inform the future World of the Greatness and Delicacy of his Mind ; it being for its Situation , its Prospects , and its marvellous Contrivances , one of the finest Villa 's of the World ; at least , were it finish 'd as begun ; and would sufficiently declare the magnifick Soul of the Hero that caus 'd it to be built , and contriv 'd all its Fineness . And this makes up not the least part of the beautiful Prospect from the Palace Royal , while on the other side lies spread a fruitful and delightful Park and Forest well stor 'd with Deer , and all that makes the Prospect charming ; fine Walks , Groves , distant Valleys , Downs and Hills , and all that Nature could invent , to furnish out a quiet soft Retreat for the most fair and most charming of Queens , and the most Heroick , Good , and Just of Kings : And these Groves alone are fit and worthy to divert such earthly Gods .</p>
   <p>Nor can Heaven , Nature , or human Art contrive an Addition to this earthly Paradise , unless those great Inventors of the Age , Sir Samuel Morland , or Sir Robert Gorden , cou 'd by the power of Engines , convey the Water so into the Park and Castle , as to furnish it with delightful Fountains , both useful and beautiful . These are only wanting , to render the Place all Perfection , and without Exception .</p>
   <p>This , Damon , is a long Digression from the Business of my Heart ; but , you know I am so in love with that charming Court , that when you gave me an occasion , by your being there now , but to name the Place , I could not forbear transgressing a little , in favour of its wondrous Beauty ; and the rather , because I would , in recounting it , give you to understand how many fine Objects there are , besides the Ladies that adorn it , to employ your vacant Moments in ; and I hope you will , without my Instructions , pass a great part of your idle time in surveying these Prospects , and give that Admiration you should pay to living Beauty , to those more venerable Monuments of everlasting Fame .</p>
   <p>Neither need I , Damon , assign you your waiting Times : your Honour , Duty , Love , and Obedience , will instruct you when to be near the Person of the King ; and , I believe , you will omit no part of that Devoir . You ought to establish your Fortune and your Glory : for I am not of the mind of those critical Lovers , who believe it a very hard matter to reconcile Love and Interest , to adore a Mistress , and serve a Master at the same Time . And I have heard those , who on this Subject , say , Let a Man be never so careful in these double Duties , ‘ tis ten to one but he loses his Fortune or his Mistress . These are Errors that I condemn : And I know that Love and Ambition are not incompatible , but that a brave Man may preserve all his Duties to his Sovereign , and his Passion and his Respect for his Mistress . And this is my Notion of it .</p>

   <p>Such a Passion , Damon , can never make you quit any Part of your Duty to your Prince . And the Monarch you serve is so gallant a Master , that the Inclination you have to his Person obliges you to serve him , as much as your Duty ; for Damon 's loyal Soul loves the Man , and adores the Monarch : for he is certainly all that compels both , by a charming Force and Goodness , from all Mankind .</p>

   <p>But I will stop the low Flight of my humble Muse , who when she is upon the wing , on this glorious Subject , knows no Bounds .

   <p>You will be very unjust , Damon , if you do not confess I have acquitted my self like a Maid of Honour , of all the Obligations I owe you , upon the account of the Discretion I lost to you . If it be not valuable enough , I am generous enough to make it good : And since I am so willing to be just , you ought to esteem me , and to make it your chiefest Care to preserve me yours ; for I believe I shall deserve it , and wish you should believe so too .

   <p>Expect not , Oh charming Iris ! that I should chuse Words to thank you in ; ( Words , that least Part of Love , and least the Business of the Lover ) but will say all , and every thing that a tender Heart can dictate , to make an Acknowledgment for so dear and precious a Present as this of your charming Watch : while all I can say will but too dully express my Sense of Gratitude , my Joy , and the Pleasure I receive in the mighty Favour . I confess the Present too rich , too gay , and too magnificent for my Expectation : and tho ’ my Love and Faith deserve it , yet my humbler Hope never durst carry me to a Wish of so great a Bliss , so great an Acknowledgment from the Maid I adore . The Materials are glorious , the Work delicate , and the Movement just , and even gives Rules to my Heart , who shall observe very exactly all that the Cupid remarks to me ; even to the Minutes , which I will point with Sighs , tho ’ I am obliged to ‘ em there but every half Hour .</p>
   <p>You tell me , fair Iris , that I ought to preserve it tenderly , and yet you have sent it me without a Case . But that I may obey you justly , and keep it dear to me , as long as I live , I will give it a Case of my Fashion : It shall be delicate , and suitable to the fine Present ; of such Materials too . But because I would have it perfect , I will consult your admirable Wit and Invention in an Affair of so curious a Consequence .</p>
   <p>The FIGURE of the CASE .</p>
   <p>I design to give it the Figure of the Heart . Does not your Watch , Iris , rule the Heart ? It was your Heart that contrived it , and ‘ twas your Heart you consulted in all the Management of it ; and ‘ twas your Heart that brought it to so fine a Conclusion . The Heart never acts without Reason , and all the Heart projects , it performs with Pleasure .</p>
   <p>Your Watch , my lovely Maid , has explain 'd to me a World of rich Secrets of Love : And where should Thoughts so sacred be stored , but in the Heart , where all the Secrets of the Soul are treasur 'd up , and of which only Love alone can take a view ? ‘ Tis thence he takes his Sighs and Tears , and all his little Flatteries and Arts to please ; all his fine Thoughts , and all his mighty Raptures ; nothing is so proper as the Heart to preserve it , nothing so worthy as the Heart to contain it : and it concerns my Interest too much , not to be infinitely careful of so dear a Treasure : And believe me , charming Iris , I will never part with it .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>After having told you , my lovely Iris , that I design to put your Watch into a Heart , I ought to shew you the Ornaments of the Case . I do intend to have ‘ em crown 'd Cyphers : I do not mean those Crowns of Vanity , which are put indifferently on all sorts of Cyphers ; no , I must have such as may distinguish mine from the rest , and may be true Emblems of what I would represent . My four Cyphers therefore shall be crown 'd with these four Wreaths , of Olive , Laurel , Myrtle , and Roses : and the Letters that begin the Names of Iris and Damon shall compose the Cyphers ; tho ’ I must intermix some other Letters that bear another Sense , and have another Signification .</p>
   <p>The First CYPHER .</p>
   <p>The first Cypher is compos 'd of an I and a D , which are join 'd by an L and an E ; which signifies Love Extreme . And ‘ tis but just , Oh adorable Iris ! that Love should be mixt with our Cyphers , and that Love alone should be the Union of ‘ em .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Love ought alone the Mystick Knot to tie ;</l>
     <l n="2">Love , that great Master of all Arts :</l>
     <l n="3">And this dear Cypher is to let you see ,</l>
     <l n="4">Love unites Names as well as Hearts .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Without this charming Union , our Souls could not communicate those invisible Sweetnesses , which compleat the Felicity of Lovers , and which the most tender and passionate Expressions are too feeble to make us comprehend . But , my adorable Iris , I am contented with the vast Pleasure I feel in loving well , without the care of expressing it well ; if you will imagine my Pleasure , without expressing it : For I confess , ‘ twould be no Joy to me to adore you , if you did not perfectly believe I did adore you . Nay , tho ’ you lov 'd me , if you had no Faith in me , I should languish , and love in as much Pain , as if you scorn 'd ; and at the same time believ 'd I dy 'd for you : For surely , Iris , ‘ tis a greater Pleasure to please than to be pleas 'd ; and the glorious Power of Giving is infinitely a greater Satisfaction , than that of Receiving : there is so Great and God-like a Quality in it . I would have your Belief therefore equal to my Passion , extreme ; as indeed all Love should be , or it cannot bear that Divine Name : it can pass but for an indifferent Affection . And these Cyphers ought to make the World find all the noble Force of delicate Passion : for , Oh my Iris ! what would Love signify , if we did not love fervently ? Sisters and Brothers love ; Friends and Relations have Affections : but where the Souls are join 'd , which are fill 'd with eternal soft Wishes , Oh ! there is some Excess of Pleasure , which cannot be express 'd !</p>
   <p>Your Looks , your dear obliging Words , and your charming Letters , have sufficiently persuaded me of your Tenderness ; and you might surely see the Excess of my Passion by my Cares , my Sighs , and entire Resignation to your Will . I never think of Iris , but my Heart feels double Flames , and pants and heaves with double Sighs ; and whose Force makes its Ardours known , by a thousand Transports : And they are very much to blame , to give the Name of Love to feeble easy Passions . Such transitory tranquil Inclinations are at best but Well-wishers to Love ; and a Heart that has such Heats as those , ought not to put it self into the Rank of those nobler Victims that are offer 'd at the Shrine of Love . But our Souls , Iris , burn with a more glorious Flame , that lights and conducts us beyond a Possibility of losing one another . ‘ Tis this that flatters all my Hopes ; ‘ tis this alone makes me believe my self worthy of Iris : And let her judge of its Violence , by the Greatness of its Splendour .</p>
   <p>Does not a Passion of this nature , so true , so ardent , deserve to be crown 'd ? And will you wonder to see , over this Cypher , a Wreath of Myrtles , those Boughs so sacred to the Queen of Love , and so worshipp 'd by Lovers ? ‘ Tis with these soft Wreaths , that those are crown 'd , who understand how to love well and faithfully .</p>

   <p>Is crown 'd with Olives ; and I add to the two Letters of our Names an R and an L , for Reciprocal Love . Every time that I have given you , O lovely Iris , Testimonies of my Passion , I have been so blest , as to receive some from your Bounty ; and you have been pleased to flatter me with a Belief , that I was not indifferent to you . I dare therefore say , that being honour 'd with the Glory of your Tenderness and Care , I ought , as a Trophy of my illustrious Conquest , to adorn the Watch with a Cypher that is so advantageous to me . Ought I not to esteem my self the most fortunate and happy of Mankind , to have exchanged my Heart with so charming and admirable a Person as Iris ? Ah ! how sweet , how precious is the Change ; and how vast a Glory arrives to me from it ! Oh ! you must not wonder if my Soul abandon it self to a thousand Extasies ! In the Merchandize of Hearts , Oh , how dear it is to receive as much as one gives ; and barter Heart for Heart ! Oh ! I would not receive mine again , for all the Crowns the Universe contains ! Nor ought you , my Adorable , make any Vows or Wishes , ever to retrieve yours ; or shew the least Repentance for the Blessing you have given me . The Exchange we made , was confirm 'd by a noble Faith ; and you ought to believe , you have bestow 'd it well , since you are paid for it a Heart that is so conformable to yours , so true , so just , and so full of Adoration : And nothing can be the just Recompence of Love , but Love : and to enjoy the true Felicity of it , our Hearts ought to keep an equal Motion ; and , like the Scales of Justice , always hang even .</p>
   <p>‘ Tis the Property of Reciprocal Love , to make the Heart feel the Delicacy of Love , and to give the Lover all the Ease and Softness he can reasonably hope . Such a Love renders all things advantageous and prosperous : Such a Love triumphs over all other Pleasures . And I put a Crown of Olives over the Cypher of Reciprocal Love , to make known , that two Hearts , where Love is justly equal , enjoy a Peace that nothing can disturb .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The C and the L , which are join 'd to the Letters of our Names in this Cypher crown 'd with Laurel , explains a Constant Love . It will not , my fair Iris , suffice , that my Love is extreme , my Passion violent , and my Wishes fervent , or that our Loves are reciprocal ; but it ought also to be constant : for in Love , the Imagination is oftner carried to those things that may arrive , and which we wish for , than to things that Time has robbed us of . And in those agreeable Thoughts of Joys to come , the Heart takes more delight to wander , than in all those that are past ; tho ’ the Remembrance of ‘ em be very dear , and very charming . We should be both unjust , if we were not persuaded we are possest with a Virtue , the Use of which is so admirable as that of Constancy . Our Loves are not of that sort that can finish , or have an end ; but such a Passion , so perfect , and so constant , that it will be a Precedent for future Ages , to love perfectly ; and when they would express an extreme Passion , they will say , They lov 'd , as Damon did the charming Iris . And he that knows the Glory of constant Love , will despise those fading Passions , those little Amusements , that serve for a Day . What Pleasure or Dependance can one have in a Love of that sort ? What Concern ? What Raptures can such an Amour produce in a Soul ? And what Satisfaction can one promise one 's self in playing with a false Gamester ; who tho ’ you are aware of him , in spite of all your Precaution , puts the false Dice upon you , and wins all ?</p>

   <p>Constant Love finds it self impossible to be shaken ; it resists the Attacks of Envy , and a thousand Accidents that endeavour to change it : Nothing can disoblige it but a known Falseness , or Contempt : Nothing can remove it ; tho ’ for a short moment it may lie sullen and resenting , it recovers , and returns with greater Force and Joy . I therefore , with very good reason , crown this Cypher of Constant Love with a Wreath of Laurel ; since such Love always triumphs over Time and Fortune , tho ’ it be not her Property to besiege : for she cannot overcome , but in defending her self ; but the Victories she gains are never the less glorious .</p>

     <l n="5">The Fourth CYPHER .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Perhaps , my lovely Maid , you will not find out what I mean by the S and the L , in this last Cypher , that is crown 'd with Roses . I will therefore tell you , I mean Secret Love . There are very few People who know the Nature of that Pleasure , which so divine a Love creates : And let me say what I will of it , they must feel it themselves , who would rightly understand it , and all its ravishing Sweets . But this there is a great deal of Reason to believe , that the Secrecy in Love doubles the Pleasures of it . And I am so absolutely persuaded of this , that I believe all those Favours that are not kept secret , are dull and pall 'd , very insipid and tasteless Pleasures : And let the Favours be never so innocent that a Lover receives from a Mistress , she ought to value ‘ em , set a price upon ‘ em , and make the Lover pay dear ; while he receives ‘ em with Difficulty , and sometimes with Hazard . A Lover that is not secret , but suffers every one to count his Sighs , has at most but a feeble Passion , such as produces sudden and transitory Desires , which die as soon as born : A true Love has not this Character ; for whensoever ‘ tis made publick , it ceases to be a Pleasure , and is only the Result of Vanity . Not that I expect our Loves should always remain a Secret : No , I should never , at that rate , arrive to a Blessing , which , above all the Glories of the Earth , I aspire to ; but even then there are a thousand Joys , a thousand Pleasures that I shall be as careful to conceal from the foolish World , as if the whole Preservation of that Pleasure depended on my Silence ; as indeed it does in a great measure .</p>
   <p>To this Cypher I put a Crown of Roses , which are not Flowers of a very lasting Date . And ‘ tis to let you see , that ‘ tis impossible Love can be long hid . We see every Day , with what fine Dissimulation and Pains , People conceal a thousand Hates and Malices , Disgusts , Disobligations , and Resentments , without being able to conceal the least part of their Love : but Reputation has an Odour as well as Roses ; and a Lover ought to esteem that as the dearest and tenderest thing : not only that of his own , which is , indeed , the least part ; but that of his Mistress , more valuable to him than Life . He ought to endeavour to give People no occasion to make false Judgments of his Actions , or to give their Censures ; which most certainly are never in the Favour of the Fair Person : for likely , those false Censurers are of the busy Female Sex , the Coquets of that number ; whose little Spites and Railleries , join 'd to that fancy 'd Wit they boast of , sets ‘ em at odds with all the Beautiful and Innocent . And how very little of that kind serves to give the World a Faith , when a thousand Virtues , told of the same Persons , by more credible Witnesses and Judges , shall pass unregarded ! so willing and inclin 'd is all the World to credit the Ill , and condemn the Good ! And yet , Oh ! what pity ‘ tis we are compell 'd to live in Pain , to oblige this foolish scandalous World ! And tho ’ we know each other 's Virtue and Honour , we are oblig 'd to observe that Caution ( to humour the talking Town ) which takes away so great a part of the Pleasure of Life ! ‘ Tis therefore that among those Roses , you will find some Thorns ; by which you may imagine , that in Love , Precaution is necessary to its Secrecy : And we must restrain our selves , upon a thousand occasions , with so much Care , that , Oh Iris ! ‘ tis impossible to be discreet , without Pain ; but ‘ tis a Pain that creates a thousand Pleasures .</p>

But that it may be safe for ever , I design it the Image , or Figure of two Hands ; that fair one of the adorable Iris , join 'd to mine ; with this Motto , Inviolable Faith : For in this Case , this Heart ought to be shut up by this eternal Clasp . Oh ! there is nothing so necessary as this ! Nothing can secure Love , but Faith .</p>
   <p>That Virtue ought to be a Guard to all the Heart thinks , and all the Mouth utters : Nor can Love say he triumphs without it . And when that remains not in the Heart , all the rest deserves no Regard . Oh ! I have not lov 'd so ill to leave one Doubt upon your Soul .

And my chiefest Design in these Cyphers , is to comprehend in them the principal Virtues that are most necessary to Love . Do not we know that Reciprocal Love is Justice ? Constant Love , Fortitude ? Secret Love , Prudence ? Tho ’ ‘ tis true that extreme Love , that is , Excess of Love , in one sense , appears not to be Temperance ; yet you must know , my Iris , that in Matters of Love , Excess is a Virtue , and that all other Degrees of Love are worthy Scorn alone . ‘ Tis this alone that can make good the glorious Title : ‘ Tis this alone that can bear the Name of Love ; and this alone that renders the Lovers truly happy , in spight of all the Storms of Fate , and Shocks of Fortune . This is an Antidote against all other Griefs : This bears up the Soul in all Calamity ; and is the very Heaven of Life , the last Refuge of all worldly Pain and Care , and may well bear the Title of Divine .</p>

Pray observe how free and easy it is , without Constraint , Stiffness , or Affectation ; those mistaken Graces of the Fantastick , and the Formal , who give themselves pain to shew their Will to please , and whose Dressing makes the greatest part of its Fineness , when they are more oblig 'd to the Taylor than to Nature ; who add or diminish , as occasion serves , to form a Grace , where Heaven never gave it : And while they remain on this Wreck of Pride , they are eternally uneasy , without pleasing any body . Iris , I have seen a Woman of your Acquaintance , who , having a greater Opinion of her own Person than any body else , has screw 'd her Body into so fine a Form ( as she calls it ) that she dares no more stir a Hand , lift up an Arm , or turn her Head aside , than if , for the Sin of such a Disorder , she were to be turn 'd into a Pillar of Salt ; the less stiff and fix 'd Statue of the two . Nay , she dares not speak or smile , lest she should put her Face out of that Order she had set it in her Glass , when she last look 'd on her self : And is all over such a Lady Nice ( excepting in her Conversation ) that ever made a ridiculous Figure . And there are many Ladies more , but too much tainted with that nauseous Formality , that old-fashion 'd Vice : But Iris , the charming , the all-perfect Iris , has nothing in her whole Form that is not free , natural , and easy ; and whose every Motion cannot but please extremely ; and which has not given Damon a thousand Rivals .</p>

   <p>Say what you will , I am confident , if you will confess your Heart , you are , every time you view your self in me , surpris 'd at the Beauty of your Complexion ; and will secretly own , you never saw any thing so fair .

If you will not believe me , ask Damon ; he tells it you every Day , but that Truth from him offends you : and because he loves too much , you think his Judgment too little ; and since this is so perfect , that must be defective . But ‘ tis most certain your Complexion is infinitely fine , your Skin soft and smooth as polisht Wax , or Ivory , extreamely white and clear ; tho ’ if any body speaks but of your Beauty , an agreeable Blush casts it self all over your Face , and gives you a thousand new Graces .</p>

   <p>Love does not make less use of your Hair for new Conquests , than of all the rest of your Beauties that adorn you . If he takes our Hearts with your fine Eyes , it ties ‘ em fast with your Hair ; and of it weaves a Chain , not easily broken . It is not of those sorts of Hair , whose Harshness discovers Ill-Nature ; nor of those , whose Softness shews us the Weakness of the Mind ; not that either of these Arguments are without exception : but ‘ tis such as bears the Character of a perfect Mind , and a delicate Wit ; and for its Colour , the most faithful , discreet , and beautiful in the World : such as shews a Complexion and Constitution , neither so cold to be insensible , nor so hot to have too much Fire : that is , neither too white , nor too black ; but such a mixture of the two Colours , as makes it the most agreeable in the World .</p>

   <p>But , O Iris ! the Beauties of the Body are imperfect , if the Beauties of the Soul do not advance themselves to an equal Height . But , O Iris ! what Mortal is there so damn 'd to Malice , that does not , with Adoration , confess , that you , O charming Maid , have an equal Portion of all the Braveries and Virtues of the Mind ? And who is it , that confesses your Beauty , that does not at the same time acknowledge and bow to your Wisdom ? The whole World admires both in you ; and all with impatience ask , Which of the two is most surprizing , your Beauty , or your Discretion ? But we dispute in vain on that excellent Subject ; for after all , ‘ tis determin 'd , that the two Charms are equal . ‘ Tis none of those idle Discretions that consists in Words alone , and ever takes the Shadow of Reason for the Substance ; and that makes use of all the little Artifices of Subtlety , and florid Talking , to make the Out-side of the Argument appear fine , and leave the Inside wholly misunderstood ; who runs away with Words , and never thinks of Sense . But you , O lovely Maid ! never make use of these affected Arts ; but without being too brisk or too severe , too silent or too talkative , you inspire in all your Hearers a Joy , and a Respect . Your Soul is an Enemy to that usual Vice of your Sex , of using little Arguments against the Fair ; or , by a Word or Jest , making your self and Hearers pleasant at the expence of the Fame of others .</p>
   <p>Your Heart is an Enemy to all Passions , but that of Love . And this is one of your noble Maxims , That every one ought to love , in some part of his Life ; and that in a Heart truly brave , Love is without Folly : That Wisdom is a Friend to Love , and Love to perfect Wisdom . Since these Maxims are your own , do not , O charming Iris ! resist that noble Passion : and since Damon is the most tender of Lovers , answer his Passion with a noble Ardour . Your Prudence never fails in the Choice of your Friends ; and in chusing so well your Lover , you will stand an eternal Precedent to all unreasonable Fair Ones .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Who but your Lovers , fair Iris ! doubts but you are the most complaisant Person in the World ; and that with so much Sweetness you oblige all , that you command in yielding : And as you gain the Heart of both Sexes , with the Affability of your noble Temper ; so all are proud and vain of obliging you . And , Iris , you may live assur 'd , that your Empire is eternally established by your Beauty and your Goodness : Your Power is confirm 'd , and you grow in Strength every Minute : Your Goodness gets you Friends , and your Beauty Lovers .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This Goodness is not one of those , whose Folly renders it easy to every</l>
     <l n="2">Desirer ; but a pure Effect of the Generosity of your Soul ; such as</l>
     <l n="3">Prudence alone manages , according to the Merit of the Person to whom</l>
     <l n="4">it is extended ; and those whom you esteem , receive the sweet Marks of</l>
     <l n="5">it , and only your Lovers complain ; yet even then you charm . And tho ’</l>
     <l n="6">sometimes you can be a little disturb 'd , yet thro ’ your Anger your</l>
     <l n="7">Goodness shines ; and you are but too much afraid , that that may bear</l>
     <l n="8">a false Interpretation : For oftentimes Scandal makes that pass for an</l>
     <l n="9">Effect of Love , which is purely that of Complaisance .</l>

     <l n="10">Never had any body more Tenderness for their Friends , than Iris :</l>
     <l n="11">Their Presence gives her Joy , their Absence Trouble ; and when</l>
     <l n="12">she cannot see them , she finds no Pleasure like speaking of them</l>
     <l n="13">obligingly . Friendship reigns in your Heart , and Sincerity on your</l>
     <l n="14">Tongue . Your Friendship is so strong , so constant , and so tender , that</l>
     <l n="15">it charms , pleases , and satisfies all , that are not your Adorers .</l>
     <l n="16">Damon therefore is excusable , if he be not contented with your noble</l>

   <p>You are deceiv 'd in me , fair Iris , if you take me for one of those ordinary Glasses , that represent the Beauty only of the Body ; I remark to you also the Beauties of the Soul : And all about you declares yours the finest that ever was formed ; that you have a Wit that surprizes , and is always new : ‘ Tis none of those that loses its Lustre when one considers it ; the more we examine yours , the more adorable we find it . You say nothing that is not at once agreeable and solid ; ‘ tis always quick and ready , without Impertinence , that little Vanity of the Fair : who , when they know they have Wit , rarely manage it so , as not to abound in Talking ; and think , that all they say must please , because luckily they sometimes chance to do so . But Iris never speaks , but ‘ tis of use ; and gives a Pleasure to all that hear her : She has the perfect Air of penetrating , even the most secret Thoughts . How often have you known , without being told , all that has past in Damon 's Heart ? For all great Wits are Prophets too .</p>

     <l n="27">The MODESTY of IRIS .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I perceive , fair Iris , you have a mind to tell me , I have entertain 'd you too long with a Discourse on your self . I know your Modesty makes this Declaration an Offence , and you suffer me , with Pain , to unveil those Treasures you would hide . Your Modesty , that so commendable a Virtue in the Fair , and so peculiar to you , is here a little too severe . Did I flatter you , you should blush : Did I seek , by praising you , to shew an Art of speaking finely , you might chide . But , O Iris , I say nothing but such plain Truths , as all the World can witness are so : And so far I am from Flattery , that I seek no Ornament of Words . Why do you take such Care to conceal your Virtues ? They have too much Lustre , not to be seen , in spight of all your Modesty : Your Wit , your Youth , and Reason , oppose themselves against this dull Obstructer of our Happiness . Abate , O Iris , a little of this Virtue , since you have so many others to defend your self against the Attacks of your Adorers . You your self have the least Opinion of your own Charms : and being the only Person in the World , that is not in love with ‘ em , you hate to pass whole Hours before your Looking-Glass ; and to pass your Time , like most of the idle Fair , in dressing , and setting off those Beauties , which need so little Art . You more wise , disdain to give those Hours to the Fatigue of Dressing , which you know so well how to employ a thousand ways . The Muses have blest you , above your Sex ; and you know how to gain a Conquest with your Pen , more absolutely than all the industrious Fair , who trust to Dress and Equipage .</p>
   <p>I have a thousand Things to tell you more , but willingly resign my Place to Damon , that faithful Lover ; he will speak more ardently than I : For let a Glass use all its Force , yet , when it speaks its best , it speaks but coldly .</p>
   <p>If my Glass , O charming Iris , have the good Fortune ( which I could never entirely boast ) to be believ 'd , ‘ twill serve at least to convince you I have not been so guilty of Flattery , as I have a thousand Times been charg 'd . Since then my Passion is equal to your Beauty ( without Comparison , or End ) believe , O lovely Maid ! how I sigh in your Absence ; and be persuaded to lessen my Pain , and restore me to my Joys : for there is no Torment so great , as the Absence of a Lover from his Mistress ; of which this is the Idea .</p>
   <p>The Effects of Absence from what we love .</p>

     <l n="1">Thou one continu 'd Sigh ! all over Pain !</l>
     <l n="2">Eternal Wish ! but Wish , alas , in vain !</l>

     <l n="4">A busy Toiler , and yet still undone !</l>
     <l n="5">A breaking Glimpse of distant Day ,</l>
     <l n="6">Inticing on , and leading more astray !</l>
     <l n="7">Thou Joy in Prospect , future Bliss extreme ;</l>
     <l n="8">Never to be possess 'd , but in a Dream !</l>
     <l n="9">Thou fab'lous Goddess , which the ravisht Boy</l>
     <l n="10">In happy Slumbers proudly did enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="11">But waking , found an airy Cloud he prest ;</l>

    <head>WITH A VOYAGE TO THE</head>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">To the Right Honourable , JAMES , Earl of Salisbury , Viscount</l>

     <l n="3">My Lord ,</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Who should one celibrate with Verse and Song , but the Great , the Noble and the Brave ? where dedicate an Isle of Love , but to the Gay , the Soft and Young ? and who amongst Men can lay a better claim to these than Your Lordship ? who like the Sun new risen with the early Day , looks round the World and sees nothing it cannot claim an interest in ( for what cannot Wit , Beauty , Wealth and Honour claim ? ) The violent storms of Sedition and Rebellion are hush 'd and calm 'd ; black Treason is retir 'd to its old abode , the dark Abyss of Hell ; the mysterious Riddles of Politick Knaves and Fools , which so long amused and troubled the World 's repose , are luckily unfolded ; and Your Lordship is saluted at Your first coming forth , Your first setting out for the glorious and happy Race of Life , by a Nation all glad , gay and smiling ; and you have nothing before you but a ravishing prospect of eternal Joys , and everlasting inviting Pleasures , and all that Love and Fortune can bestow on their darling Youth , attend You in the noble pursuit ; and nothing can prevent Your being the most happy of her Favourites , but a too eager flight , a too swift speed o'er the charming flowry Meads and Plains that lie in view , between Your setting out and the end of Your glorious Chase . A long and illustrious race of Nobility has attended Your great Name , but none I believe ever came into the World with Your Lordship 's advantages ; amongst which , my Lord , ‘ tis not the least that You have the glory to be truly Loyal , and to be adorn 'd with those excellent Principles , which render Nobility so absolutely worth the Veneration which is paid ‘ em ; ‘ tis those , my Lord , and not the Title that make it truly great : Grandeur in any other serves but to point ‘ em out more particularly to the World , and shew their Faults with the greater magnitude , and render ‘ em more liable to contempt and that Reward which justly persues Ingratitude ; nor is it , my Lord , the many unhappy Examples this Age has produc 'd that has deterr 'd you from herding with the busie Unfortunates , and bringing Your powerful aid to their detestable cause , but a noble Honesty in Your Nature , a Generosity in Your Soul . That even part of Your Education had the good fortune not to be able to corrupt ; no Opinion cou 'd bypass You , no Precedent debauch You ; though all the fansied Glories of Power were promis 'd You , though all the Contempt thrown on good and brave Men , all the subtile Arguments of the old Serpent , were us 'd against the best of Kings and his illustrious Successor , still You were unmov 'd ; Your young stout Heart with a Gallantry and Force unusual resisted and defied the gilded Bait , laugh 'd at the industrious Politicks of the busie Wise , and stubbornly Loyal , contemn 'd the Counsels of the Grave . Go on , my Lord , advance in Noble resolution , grow up in strength of Loyalty , settle it about Your Soul , root it there like the first Principles of Religion , which nothing ever throughly defaces , and which in spight of even Reason the Soul retains , whatever little Debaucheries the Tongue may commit ; You that are great , are born the Bulwarks of sacred Majesty , its defence against all the storms of Fate , the Safety of the People in the Supporters of the Throne ; and sure none that ever obey 'd the Laws of God and the Dictates of Honour ever paid those Duties to a Sovereign that more truly merited the Defence and Adorations of his People than this of ours ; and tis a blessing ( since we are oblig 'd to render it to the worst of Tyrant Kings ) that we have one who so well justifies that intire Love and Submission we ought to pay him . You , my Lord , are one whom Thousands of good Men look up to with wondrous Veneration and Joy , when ‘ tis said Your Lordship amongst Your other Vertues is Loyal too , a true Tory ! ( a word of Honour now , the Royal Cause has sanctified it ,) and though Your Lordship needs no encouragement to a good that rewards it self , yet I am confident You are not onely rank 'd in the esteem of the best of Monarchs , but we shall behold you as one of our Preservers , and all England as one of its great Patrons , when Ages that shall come shall find Your noble Name inroll 'd amongst the Friends to Monarchy in an Age of so villainous Corruption : Yes , my Lord , they will find it there and bless You . ‘ Tis this , my Lord , with every other Grace and Noble Vertue that adorns You , and gives the World such promises of Wonders in You , that makes me ambitious to be the first in the Croud of Your Admirers , that shall have the honour to celibrate Your great Name . Be pleased then , my Lord , to accept this Little Piece , which lazy Minutes begot and hard Fate has oblig 'd me to bring forth into the censuring World , to which if any thing can reconcile it , ‘ twill be the glory it has to bear Your Noble Name in the front , and to be Patronized by so great and good a Man : Permit but my Zeal for Your Lordship to attone for the rest of my Faults , and Your Lordship will extremely oblige ,</p>

     <l n="74">This heart unpractis 'd in Love 's mystick pow'rs , }</l>

     <l n="77">Each happier Minute in new Joys of Love !</l>
     <l n="78">Soft were our hours ! and lavishly the Day</l>
     <l n="79">We gave intirely up to Love , and Play .</l>
     <l n="80">Oft to the cooling Groves our Flocks we led , }</l>
     <l n="81">And seated on some shaded , flowery Bed , }</l>
     <l n="82">Watch 'd the united Wantons as they fed . }</l>
     <l n="83">And all the Day my list'ning Soul I hung }</l>
     <l n="84">Upon the charming Musick of thy Tongue , }</l>

     <l n="86">No Swain , no God like thee cou 'd ever move , }</l>

     <l n="158">When they , alas , were onely so to me !</l>
     <l n="159">How oft new Vows of lasting Faith you swore ,</l>
     <l n="160">And ‘ twixt your Kisses all the old run o'er ?</l>
     <l n="161">But now the wisely Grave , who Love despise ,</l>
     <l n="162">( Themselves past hope ) do busily advise .</l>
     <l n="163">Whisper Renown , and Glory in thy Ear ,</l>
     <l n="164">Language which Lovers fright , and Swains ne'er hear .</l>
     <l n="165">For Troy , they cry ! these Shepherds Weeds lay down ,</l>
     <l n="166">Change Crooks for Scepters ! Garlands for a Crown !</l>
     <l n="167">“ But sure that Crown does far less easie sit ,</l>
     <l n="168">Than Wreaths of Flow'rs , less innocent and sweet .</l>
     <l n="169">Nor can thy Beds of State so gratefull be ,</l>
     <l n="170">As those of Moss , and new faln Leaves with me ! ”</l>
     <l n="171">Now tow'rds the Beach we go , and all the way</l>
     <l n="172">The Groves , the Fern , dark Woods , and springs survey ;</l>
     <l n="173">That were so often conscious to the Rites</l>
     <l n="174">Of sacred Love , in our dear stoln Delights .</l>
     <l n="175">With Eyes all languishing , each place you view ,</l>
     <l n="176">And sighing cry , Adieu , dear Shades , Adieu !</l>
     <l n="177">Then ‘ twas thy Soul e'en doubted which to doe ,</l>
     <l n="178">Refuse a Crown , or those dear Shades forego !</l>
     <l n="179">Glory and Love ! the great dispute pursu 'd ,</l>
     <l n="180">But the false Idol soon the God subdu 'd .</l>
     <l n="181">And now on Board you go , and all the Sails</l>
     <l n="182">Are loosned , to receive the flying Gales .</l>
     <l n="183">Whilst I , half dead on the forsaken Strand , }</l>
     <l n="184">Beheld thee sighing on the Deck to stand , }</l>
     <l n="185">Wafting a thousand Kisses from thy Hand . }</l>
     <l n="186">And whilst I cou 'd the lessening Vessel see ,</l>
     <l n="187">I gaz 'd , and sent a thousand Sighs to thee !</l>
     <l n="188">And all the Sea-born Nereids implore</l>
     <l n="189">Quick to return thee to our Rustick shore .</l>

     <l n="193">This Shade th'account of thousand Joys does hide ,</l>

     <l n="202">From far the blewish Shore , and distant Sea , }</l>
     <l n="203">Whose hanging top with toyl I climb 'd each day , }</l>
     <l n="204">With greedy View the prospect I ran o'er ,</l>
     <l n="205">To see what wish 'd for ships approach 'd our shore .</l>
     <l n="206">One day all hopeless on its point I stood ,</l>
     <l n="207">And saw a Vessel bounding o'er the Flood ,</l>
     <l n="208">And as it nearer drew , I cou 'd discern</l>
     <l n="209">Rich Purple Sails , Silk Cords , and Golden Stern ;</l>
     <l n="210">Upon the Deck a Canopy was spread }</l>
     <l n="211">Of Antique work in Gold and Silver made , }</l>
     <l n="212">Which mix 'd with Sun-beams dazling Light display 'd . }</l>
     <l n="213">But oh ! beneath this glorious Scene of State</l>
     <l n="214">( Curst be the sight ) a fatal Beauty sate .</l>
     <l n="215">And fondly you were on her Bosome lay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="216">Whilst with your perjur 'd Lips her Fingers play 'd ;</l>
     <l n="217">Wantonly curl 'd and dally 'd with that hair ,</l>
     <l n="218">Of which , as sacred Charms , I Bracelets wear .</l>
     <l n="219">Oh ! hadst thou seen me then in that mad state ,</l>
     <l n="220">So ruin 'd , so desig 'd for Death and Fate ,</l>
     <l n="221">Fix 'd on a Rock , whose horrid Precipice</l>
     <l n="222">In hollow Murmurs wars with Angry Seas ;</l>
     <l n="223">Whilst the bleak Winds aloft my Garments bear , }</l>
     <l n="224">Ruffling my careless and dishevel 'd hair , }</l>
     <l n="225">I look 'd like the sad Statue of Despair . }</l>
     <l n="226">With out-strech 'd voice I cry 'd , and all around</l>
     <l n="227">The Rocks and Hills my dire complaints resound .</l>
     <l n="228">I rent my Garments , tore my flattering Face ,</l>
     <l n="229">Whose false deluding Charms my Ruine was .</l>
     <l n="230">Mad as the Seas in Storms , I breathe Despair ,</l>
     <l n="231">Or Winds let loose in unresisting Air .</l>
     <l n="232">Raging and Frantick through the Woods I fly ,</l>
     <l n="233">And Paris ! lovely , faithless Paris cry .</l>
     <l n="234">But when the Echos sound thy Name again ,</l>
     <l n="235">I change to new variety of Pain .</l>

     <l n="237">And turns all Passion to Loves softer Fires :</l>
     <l n="238">With tears I fall to kind Complaints again ,</l>
     <l n="239">So Tempests are allay 'd by Show'rs of Rain .</l>

     <l n="241">My easie Faith , and lead my heart astray ?</l>
     <l n="242">I might some humble Shepherd 's Choice have been ,</l>

     <l n="246">All day by shaded Springs my Flocks have kept ,</l>
     <l n="247">And in some honest Arms at night have slept .</l>
     <l n="248">Then unupbraided with my wrongs thou'dst been</l>
     <l n="249">Safe in the Joys of the fair Grecian Queen :</l>

     <l n="258">Not my fair Rival wou 'd I wish to be ,</l>
     <l n="259">To come prophan 'd by others Joys to thee .</l>
     <l n="260">A spotless Maid into thy Arms I brought ,</l>

    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <head>Le Voyage de l'Isle d'Amour , that dainty fantasy which has been so admirably translated by Mrs. Behn , is the work of Paul Tallemant , a graceful French litterateur , who was born at Paris , 18 June , 1642 . He was brought up in circumstances of affluence and even prodigal luxury until the extravagances and dissipations of both grandfather and father left him whilst yet young in a state of indigence . He thereupon took orders , but , as was not unusual at the time , devoted much attention to art and literature , becoming well known in society for his songs , ballads , idylls , pastorals , and even gallant little operas in which he never ceased to burn incense to the King . He proved so successful that at twenty-four in 1666 he succeeded to the place of Gombaud in the Academy . His chief title to literary renown at that date was none other than Le Voyage de l'Isle d'Amour . Colbert , his patron , procured for him a pension of 500 crowns , the abbeys of Ambierle and Saint-Albin , together with various other posts affording no small emoluments . Tallemant became a popular preacher and society flocked to hear his fashionable discourses . He frequently counted the Queen and Princes of the blood amongst his auditors . He died of an apoplexy in his seventy-first year . His poems , always neat and elegant , can hardly be claimed to have any great value , although they never fail to please . Mrs. Behn has indeed greatly improved upon her original . Le Voyage de l'Isle d'Amour was first printed at Paris , 12mo , 1663 . It was reprinted in Le Recueil de pieces galantes ; Cologne , 12mo , 1667 ; again , ‘ A Leyde . Chez Abraham Gogat . ’ 12mo , 1671 . Le Voyage et la Conqueste de l'Isle d'Amour , le Passe-Partout des Coeurs appeared at Paris ‘ chez Augustin Besoigne ’ 1675 . With the sub-title La Clef des Coeurs it was issued from van Bulderen 's press at the Hague in 1713 , 12mo . So it will be seen that the little book enjoyed no small popularity . The best edition is that in volume XXVI of the collection entitled Voyages Imaginaires , Songes , Visions , et Romans Cabalistiques . Amsterdam , 1788 . It is illustrated by an exquisitely graceful plate of C. P. Marillier at the lines</head>

     <l n="10">Who ever searching what it cannot find ,</l>
     <l n="11">Is roving still from wearied thought to thought ,</l>

      <l n="223">And she agrees with Blushing down-cast Eyes ;</l>
      <l n="224">‘ Twas then we both our Hearts an Offering made ,</l>
      <l n="225">Which at the Feet of the young God we laid ,</l>
      <l n="226">With equal Flames they Burnt ; with equal Joy ,</l>
      <l n="227">But with a Fire that neither did destroy ;</l>
      <l n="228">Soft was its Force and Sympathy with them ,</l>
      <l n="229">Dispers 'd it self through every trembling Limb ;</l>
      <l n="230">We cou 'd not hide our tender new surprize ,</l>
      <l n="231">We languisht and confest it with our Eyes ;</l>
      <l n="232">Thus gaz 'd we — when the Sacrifice perform 'd ,</l>
      <l n="233">We found our Hearts entire — but still they burn ,</l>
      <l n="234">But by a Blessed change in taking back ,</l>
      <l n="235">The lovely Virgin did her Heart mistake :</l>
      <l n="236">Her Bashful Eyes favour 'd Love 's great design ,</l>
      <l n="237">I took her Burning Victim : and she mine .</l>
      <l n="238">Thus , Lysidas , without constraint or Art ,</l>

      <l n="244">My Blessed hours in the extream of Joy ,</l>
      <l n="245">With my soft Languisher I still imploy ;</l>
      <l n="246">When I am Gay , Love Revels in her Eyes ,</l>
      <l n="247">When sad — there the young God all panting lies .</l>
      <l n="248">A thousand freedoms now she does impart , }</l>
      <l n="249">Shows all her tenderness dis-rob 'd of Art , }</l>
      <l n="250">But oh this cou 'd not satisfy my Heart . }</l>

      <l n="254">Whilst every touch Blows the unusual Fire .</l>
      <l n="255">For Love 's last Mystery was yet conceal 'd ,</l>
      <l n="256">Which both still languisht for , both wisht reveal 'd :</l>
      <l n="257">Which I prest on — and faintly she deny 'd ,</l>
      <l n="258">With all the weak efforts of dying Pride ,</l>
      <l n="259">Which struggled long for Empire in her Soul ,</l>
      <l n="260">Where it was wont to rule without controul .</l>
      <l n="261">But Conquering Love had got possession now ,</l>
      <l n="262">And open 'd every Sally to the Foe :</l>
      <l n="263">And to secure my doubting happiness ,</l>
      <l n="264">Permits me to conduct her to the Bow'r of Bliss .</l>
      <l n="265">That Bow'r that does eternal Pleasures yield ,</l>
      <l n="266">Where Psyche first the God of Love beheld :</l>

   <p>This Epistle Dedicatory which humbly lays this Little Volume at your Lordships feet , and begs a Protection there , is rather an Address than a Dedication ; to which a great many hands have subscrib 'd , it Presenting your Lordship a Garland whose Flowers are cull 'd by several Judgments in which I claim the least part ; whose sole Ambition is this way to congratulate your Lordships new Addition of Honour , that of the Most Noble Order of the Thistle , an Honour which preced 's that of the Garter , having been supported by a long Race of Kings , and only fell with the most Illustrious of Queens , whose memory ( which ought to be Establish 'd , in all hearts can not be better preserv 'd ,) than by reviving this so Ancient Order ; well has His Majesty chosen its Noble Champions , among whom none merits more the Glory of that Royal Favor than your Lordship : whose Loyalty to His Sacred Person and interest through all the adversities of Fate , has begot you so perfect a veneration in all hearts , and is so peculiarly the Innate vertue of your Great mind ; a virtue not shewn by unreasonable fits when it shall serve an end , ( a false Bravery for a while when least needful , and thrown off when put to useful Tryal ; like those who weighing Advantages by Probabilities only , and fancying the future to out-poyse the present , cast there their Anchor of Hope ,) but a virtue built on so sure and steady Basis 's of Honour , as nothing can move or shake ; the Royal Interest being so greatly indeed the Property of Nobility , and so much even above life and Fortune : Especially when to support a Monarch so truly just , so wise and great ; a Monarch whom God Almighty Grant long to Reign over Us , and still to be serv 'd by men of Principles so truly Brave , as those that shine in your Lordship .</p>
   <p>Pardon , my Lord , this Digression and the meanness of this Present , which to a Person of your Lordships great and weighty Employments in the world may seem Improper , if I did not know that the most Glorious of States-men must sometimes unbend from Great Affairs , and seek a diversion in trivial Entertainments ; Though Poetry will Justle for the Preeminency of all others , and I know is not the least in the Esteem of your Lordship , who is so admirable a Judge of it , if any thing here may be found worthy the Patronage it Implores , ‘ twill be a sufficient Honour to ,</p>

    <head>LYCIDUS :</head>
     <l n="1">or , the Lover in Fashion , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I Have receiv 'd your melancholy Epistle , with the Account of your Voyage to the Island of Love ; of your Adventures there , and the Relation of the death of your Aminta : At which you shall forgive me if I tell you I am neither surpris 'd nor griev 'd , but hope to see you the next Campagne , as absolutely reduc 'd to reason as myself . When Love , that has so long deprived you of Glory , shall give you no more Sighs but at the short remembrances of past Pleasures ; and that after you have heard my Account of the Voyage I made to the same place , with my more lucky one back again , ( for I , since I saw you , have been an Adventurer ) you will by my Example become of my Opinion , ( notwithstanding your dismal Tales of Death and the eternal Shades ,) which is , that if there be nothing that will lay me in my Tomb till Love brings me thither , I shall live to Eternity .</p>
   <p>I must confess ‘ tis a great Inducement to Love , and a happy Advance to an Amour , to be handsom , finely shap 'd , and to have a great deal of Wit ; these are Charms that subdue the Hearts of all the Fair : And one sees but very few Ladies , that can resist these good Qualities , especially in an Age so gallant as ours , yet all this is nothing if Fortune do not smile : And I have seen a Man handsom , well shap 'd , and of a great deal of Wit , with the advantage of a thousand happy Adventures , yet finds himself in the end , fitter for an Hospital than the Elevation of Fortune : And the Women are not contented we should give them as much Love as they give us , ( which is but reasonable ,) but they would compel us all to Present and Treat ‘ em lavishly , till a Man hath consumed both Estate and Body in their Service . How many do we see , that are wretched Examples of this Truth , and who have nothing of all they enjoyed remaining with ‘ em , but a poor Idaea of past Pleasures , when rather the Injury the Jilt has done ‘ em , ought to be eternally present with ‘ em . Heaven keep me from being a Woman 's Property . There are Cullies enough besides you or I , Lysander .</p>
   <p>One would think now , That I , who can talk thus Learnedly and Gravely , had never been any of the number of those wretched , whining , sighing , dying Fops , I speak of , never been jilted and cozen 'd of both my Heart and Reason ; but let me tell those that think so , they are mistaken , and that all this Wisdom and Discretion , I now seem replenish 'd with , I have as dearly bought as any keeping Fool of ‘ em all . I was Li 'd and flattered into Wit , jilted and cozen 'd into Prudence , and , by ten thousand broken Vows and perjured Oaths , reduced to Sense again ; and can laugh at all my past Follies now .</p>
   <p>After I have told you this , you may guess at a great part of my Story ; which , in short , is this : I would needs make a Voyage , as you did , to this fortunate Isle , and accompanyed with abundance of young Heirs , Cadets , Coxcombs , Wits , Blockheads , and Politicians , with a whole Cargo of Cullies all , nameless and numberless we Landed on the Inchanted Ground ; the first I saw , and lik 'd , was charming Silvia ; you believe I thought her fair as Angels ; young , as the Spring , and sweet as all the Flowers the blooming Fields produce ; that when she blush 'd , the Ruddy Morning open 'd , the Rose-buds blew , and all the Pinks and Dazies spread ; that when she sigh 'd or breath 'd , Arabia 's Spices , driven by gentle Winds , perfum 'd all around ; that when she look 'd on me , all Heaven was open 'd in her Azure Eyes , from whence Love shot a thousand pointed Darts , and wounded me all over ; that when she spoke , the Musick of the Spheres , all that was ravishing in Harmony , blest the Adoring Listener ; that when she walk 'd , Venus in the Mirtle Grove when she advanced to meet her lov 'd Adonis , assuming all the Grace young Loves cou 'd give , had not so much of Majesty as Silvia : In fine , she did deserve , and I compared her to all the Fopperies , the Suns , the Stars , the Coral , and the Pearl , the Roses and Lillies , Angels Spheres , and Goddesses , fond Lovers dress their Idols in . For she was all , fancy and fine imagination could adorn her with , at least , the gazing Puppy thought so . ‘ Twas such I saw and lov 'd ; but knowing I did Adore , I made my humble Court , and she , by all my trembling , sighings , pantings , the going and returning of my Blood , found all my Weakness and her own Power ; and using all the Arts of her Sex , both to ingage and secure me , play 'd all the Woman over : She wou 'd be scornful and kind by turns , as she saw convenient , This to check my Presumption and too easy hope ; That to preserve me from the brink of despair . Thus was I tost in the Blanket of Love , sometimes up , and sometimes down , as her Wit and Humour was in or out of tune , all which I watch 'd , and waited like a Dog , that still the oftner kick 'd wou 'd fawn the more .</p>
   <p>Oh , ‘ tis an excellent Art this managing of a Coxcomb , the Serpent first taught it our Grandam Eve : and Adam was the first kind Cully : E 're since they have kept their Empire over Men , and we have , e 're since , been Slaves . But I , the most submissive of the whole Creation , was long in gaining Grace ; she used me as she meant to keep me , Fool enough for her Purpose . She saw me young enough to do her Service , handsom enough to do her Credit , and Fortune enough to please her Vanity and Interest : She therefore suffer 'd me to Love , and Bow among the Crowd , and fill her Train . She gave me hope enough to secure me too , but gave me nothing else , till she saw me languish to that degree , she feared , to lose the Glory of my Services , by my death ; only this Pleasure kept me alive , to see her treat all my Rivals with the greatest Rigour imaginable , and to me all sweetness , exposing their foibles ; and having taken Notice of my Languishment , she suffered me Freedoms that wholly Ravish 'd me , and gave me hopes I shou 'd not be long a dying for all she cou 'd give .</p>
   <p>But , since I have a great deal to say of my Adventures in passing out of this Island of Love : I will be as brief as I can in what arrived to me on the Place ; and tell you , That after Ten thousand Vows of eternal Love on both sides , I had the Joy , not only to be believ 'd and lov 'd , but to have her put herself into my Possession , far from all my Rivals : Where , for some time I lived with this charming Maid , in all the Raptures of Pleasure , Youth , Beauty , and Love could create . Eternally we loved , and lived together , no day nor night separated us , no Frowns interrupted our Smiles , no Clouds our Sun-shine ; the Island was all perpetual Spring , still flowery and green , in Bowers , in Shades , by purling Springs and Fountains , we past our hours , unwearied and uninterrupted . I cannot express to you the happy Life I led , during this blessed Tranquility of Love , while Silvia still was pleased and still was gay . We walked all day together in the Groves , and entertained ourselves with a thousand Stories of Love ; we laught at the foolish World , who could not make their Felicity without Crowds and Noise : We pitied Kings in Courts in this Retirement , so well we liked our Solitude ; till on a day , ( blest be that joyful day , though then ‘ twas most accurst ,) I say upon that day , I know not by what accident I was parted from my Charmer , and left her all alone , but in my absence , there incountred her a Woman extremely ugly , and who was however very nice and peevish , inconstant in her temper , and no one place could continue her : The finest things in the World were troublesom to her , and she was Shagreen at every thing ; her Name is Indifference ; she is a Person of very great Power in this Island , ( though possibly you never incountred her there ,) and those that follow her , depart from the Isle of Love without any great pains . She brought Silvia to the Lake of Disgust , whether , in persuing her ( at my return ,) I found her , ready to take Boat to have past quite away , and where there are but too many to transport those Passengers , who follow Indifference over the Lake of Disgust . I saw this disagreeable Creature too , but she appeared too ugly for me to approach her , but forcing Silvia back , I returned again to the Palace of True Pleasure , where some days after there arrived to me a Misfortune , of which , I believed I should never have seen an end . I found Silvia inviron 'd round with new Lovers , still adoring and pleasing her a thousand ways , and though none of ‘ em were so rich , so young , or so handsom as I , she nevertheless failed not to treat ‘ em with all the Smiles and Caresses ‘ twas possible to imagin ; when I complain 'd of this , she would satisfy my fears with so many Vows and Imprecations , that I would believe her , and think myself unreasonable , but when she would be absent whole days , in a hundred places , she would find such probable Excuse , and lye with such a Grace , no mortal cou 'd have accused her , so that all the whole Island took notice that I was a baffled Cuckold , before I could believe she would deceive me , so heartily she damn 'd herself : Through all the Groves I was the pointed Coxcomb , laught at aloud , and knew not where the jest lay ; but thought myself as secure in the Innocence of my deceiving fair one , as the first hour I Charmed her , and like a keeping Cully , lavish 'd out my Fortune , my plenteous Fortune , to make her fine to Cuckold me . ‘ Sdeath ! how I scorn the Follies of my Dotage ; and am resolv 'd to persue Love for the future , in such a manner as it shall never cost me a Sigh : This shall be my method .</p>

   <p>I was a great while , ( like you ,) before I forgot the remembrance of my first Languishments , and I almost thought ( by an excess of Melancholy ,) that the end of my Misfortunes were with my Life at hand : Yet still like a fond Slave , willing to drag my Fetters on , I hop 'd she would find Arguments to convince me she was not false ; and in that Humor , fear 'd only I should not be handsomly and neatly jilted . Could she but have dissembled well , I had been still her Cully . Could she have play 'd her Game with discretion , but , vain of her Conquest , she boasted it to all the World , and I alone was the kind keeping Blockhead , to whom ‘ twas unperceived , so well she swore me into belief of her Truth to me . Till one day , lying under a solitary Shade , with my sad Thoughts fixt on my declining Happiness , and almost drown 'd in Tears , I saw a Woman drest in glorious Garments , all loose and flowing with the wind , scouring the Fields and Groves with such a pace , as Venus , when she heard her lov 'd Youth was slain , hasted to behold her ruin . She past me , as I lay , with an unexpressible swiftness , and spoke as she run , with a loud Voice . At her first approach , I felt a strange trembling at my Heart without knowing the reason , and found at last this Woman was Fame . Yet I was not able to tell from whence proceeded my Inquietude . When her Words made me but too well understand the Cause : The fatal Subject of what she cry 'd , in passing by me , were these :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Poor Lycidus , for shame arise ,</l>
     <l n="2">And wipe Loves Errors from thy Eyes ;</l>
     <l n="3">Shake off the God that holds thy Heart ;</l>
     <l n="4">Since Silvia for another burns ,</l>
     <l n="5">And all thy past Indurement scorns</l>
     <l n="6">While thou the Cully art .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I believed , as she spoke , that I had ill understood her , but she repeated it so often , that I no longer doubted my wretchedness . I leave you , who so well can guess , to imagin , what Complaints I made , filling the Grove , where I was laid , with my piteous Cries ; sometimes I rose and raved , and rail 'd on Love , and reproached the fair Fugitive . But the tender God was still pleading in my Heart , and made me ever end my noisy Griefs in Sighs and silent Tears . A thousand Thoughts of revenge I entertained against this happy Rival , and the charming ingrate : But those Thoughts , like my Rage , would also end in soft reproaching murmurs and regret only . And I would sometimes argue with Love in this manner .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ah , cruel Love ! when will thy Torments cease ?</l>
     <l n="2">And when shall I have leave to dye in Peace ?</l>
     <l n="3">And why , too charming and too cruel Maid ,</l>
     <l n="4">Cou 'd'st thou not yet thy fleeting Heart have stay 'd ?</l>
     <l n="5">And by degrees thy fickle Humor shewn ,</l>
     <l n="6">By turns the Enemy and Friend put on :</l>
     <l n="7">Have us 'd my Heart a little to thy scorn ,</l>
     <l n="8">The loss at least might have been easier born .</l>
     <l n="9">With feigned Vows , ( that poor Expence of Breath ,)</l>
     <l n="10">Alas thou might'st have sooth 'd me to my death .</l>
     <l n="11">Thy Coldness , and thy visible decays</l>
     <l n="12">In time had put a period to my days .</l>
     <l n="13">And lay 'd me quietly into my Tomb ,</l>
     <l n="14">Before thy proof of Perjuries had come .</l>
     <l n="15">You might have waited yet a little space }</l>
     <l n="16">And sav 'd mine , and thy , Honour this disgrace ; }</l>
     <l n="17">Alas I languish 'd and declin 'd apace . }</l>
     <l n="18">I lov 'd my Life too eagerly away</l>
     <l n="19">To have disturb 'd thee with too long a stay .</l>
     <l n="20">Ah ! cou 'd you not my dying Heart have fed</l>
     <l n="21">With some small Cordial Food , till I was dead ?</l>
     <l n="22">Then uncontroul 'd , and unreproach 'd your Charms</l>
     <l n="23">Might have been render 'd to my Rival 's Arms .</l>
     <l n="24">Then all my right to him you might impart ,</l>
     <l n="25">And Triumph 'd o 're a true and broken Heart .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Though I complained thus for a good while , I was not without some secret hope , that what I had heard was not true ; nor would I be persuaded to undeceive myself of that hope which was so dear and precious to me . I was not willing to be convinced I was intirely miserable , out of too great a fear to find it true ; and there were some Moments in which I believed Fame might falsly accuse Silvia , and it did not seem reasonable to me , that , after all the Vows and Oaths she had made , she should so easily betray ‘ em , and forgetting my Services , receive those of another , less capable of rend'ring them to her advantage . Sometimes I would excuse her ingratitude with a thousand things that seem 'd reasonable , but still that was but to make me more sensible of my disgrace ; and then I would accuse myself of a thousand weaknesses below the Character of a Man ; I would even despise and loath my own easiness , and resolve to be no longer a Mark-out-fool for all the Rhiming Wits of the Island to aim their Dogrel at . And grown , as I imagined , brave at this thought , I resolved first to be fully convinced of the perfidy of my Mistress , and then to rent my Heart from the attachment that held it .</p>
   <p>You know , that from the Desart of Remembrance , one does , with great facility , look over all the Island of Love . I was resolved to go thither one day ; and where indeed I could survey all things that past , in the Groves , the Bowers , by Rivers , or Fountains , or whatever other place , remote or obscure ‘ twas from thence , that one day I saw the faithless Silvia , in the Palace of True Pleasure , in the very Bower of Bliss with one of my Rivals , but most intimate Friend .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Twas there , I saw my Rival take</l>
     <l n="2">Pleasures , he knew how to make ;</l>
     <l n="3">There he took , and there was given ,</l>
     <l n="4">All the Joys that Rival Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="5">Kneeling at her Feet he lay ,</l>
     <l n="6">And in transports dy 'd away :</l>
     <l n="7">Where the faithless suffer 'd too</l>
     <l n="8">All the amorous Youth cou 'd do .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The Ardour of his fierce desire</l>
     <l n="10">Set his Face and Eyes on fire .</l>
     <l n="11">All their Language was the Blisses</l>
     <l n="12">Of Ten thousand eager Kisses ;</l>
     <l n="13">While his ravish 'd Neck she twin 'd</l>
     <l n="14">And to his Kisses , Kisses join 'd ;</l>
     <l n="15">Till , both inflam 'd , she yeilded so</l>
     <l n="16">She suffer 'd all the Youth cou 'd do .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In fine , ‘ twas there I saw that I must lose the day . And I saw in this Lover Ten thousand Charms of Youth and Beauty ; on which the ingrate with greedy languishing Eyes , eternally gazed with the same Joy she used to behold me when she made me most happy . I confess , this Object was so far from pleasing me , ( as I believed a confirmation would ,) that the change inspired me with a rage , which nothing else could do , and made me say things unbecoming the Dignity of my Sex , who ought to disdain those faithless Slaves , which Heaven first made to obey the Lords of the Creation . A thousand times I was about to have rush 'd upon ‘ em , and have ended the Lives of the loose betrayers of my repose , but Love stepp 'd in and stay 'd my hand , preventing me from an Outrage , that would have cost me that rest of Honour , I yet had left : But when my rage was abated , I fell to a more insupportable Torment , that of extream Grief to find another possest of what I had been so long , and with so much Toil in gaining : ‘ Twas thus I retir 'd , and after a little while brought myself to make calm Reflections upon this Adventure , which reduced me to some reason . When one day as I was walking in an unfrequented Shade , whither my Melancholy had conducted me , I incountred a Man , of a haughty look and meen , his Apparel rich and glorious , his Eyes awful , and his Stature tall ; the very sight of him inspired me with coldness , which render 'd me almost insensible of the infidelity of Silvia . This Person was Pride , who looking on me , as he past , with a fierce and disdainful Smile , over his Shoulder , and regarding me with scorn , said ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Why shou 'd that faithless wanton give</l>
     <l n="2">Thy Heart so mortal pain ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whose Sighs were only to deceive ,</l>
     <l n="4">Her Oaths all false and vain ?</l>
     <l n="5">Despise those Tears thou shedd'st for her ,</l>
     <l n="6">Disdain to sigh her Name .</l>
     <l n="7">To Love , thy Liberty prefer ;</l>
     <l n="8">To faithless Silvia , Fame .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I knew by his words he was Pride , or Disdain , and would have embraced him ; but he put me off , seeing Love still by me , who had not yet abandoned me , and turned himself from me with a regardless scorn , but I , who was resolved not to forsake so discreet a Counsellor , rather chose to take my leave of little Love ; who had ever accompanyed me in this Voyage . But oh ! this adieu was not taken so easily and soon as I imagined . Love was not to be quitted without abundance of Sighs and Tears at parting , he had been a Witness to all my Adventures , my Confident in this Amour , and not to be deserted without a great deal of pain ; I stayed so long in bidding the dear Boy adieu , that I had almost forgot Disdain ; at last , though my Heart were breaking to part with the dear fondling , I was resolved and said ;</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Farewel , my little charming Boy !</l>
     <l n="2">Farewel , my fond delight ,</l>

     <l n="6">And my poor Heart has held so fast ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thou never left me in my pain ,</l>
     <l n="8">Nor in my happier hours ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">But Silvia 's gone , and I have torn</l>
     <l n="14">Her Witchcrafts from my Heart ;</l>

     <l n="16">Her Empire will subvert ;</l>
     <l n="17">The Laws establish 'd there destroy ,</l>
     <l n="18">And bid adieu to the dear charming Boy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">In quitting Love I was a great while before I could find Disdain ,</l>
     <l n="20">but I , at last , overtook him : He accompanyed me to a Village , where</l>
     <l n="21">I received a Joy I had not known since my Arrival to the Isle of</l>
     <l n="22">Love , and which Repose seemed the sweeter because it was new . When I</l>
     <l n="23">came to this place , I saw all the World Easie , Idle , and at Liberty :</l>
     <l n="24">This Village is like a Desart , and all the Inhabitants live within</l>
     <l n="25">themselves , there is only one Gate , by which we enter into it from the</l>
     <l n="26">Isle of Love .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This place is called Indifference , and takes its Name from a Princess inhabiting there , a Person very fair and well made ; but has a Grace and Meen of so little Wit , and seems so inutile and so silly , that it renders her even ridiculous . As soon as I arrived there , I called to my remembrance all those affronts and cheats of Love , that Silvia had put upon me , and which now served for my diversion , and were agreeable thoughts to me ; so that I called myself Ten thousand Sots and Fools for resenting ‘ em ; and that I did not heartily despise ‘ em , laugh at ‘ em , and make my Pleasure with the false One as well as the rest ; for she dissembled well , and for ought I knew , ‘ twas but dissembled Love she paid my Rivals . But I , forsooth , was too nice a Coxcomb , I cou 'd not feed as others did , and be contented with such Pleasures as she cou 'd afford , but I must ingross all , and unreasonably believe a Woman of Youth and Wit had not a longer Race of Love to run than to my Arms alone . Well , ‘ tis now confest I was a Fool , nor could I hinder myself from saying a thousand times a day ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">That Coxcomb can ne 're be at ease ,</l>
     <l n="2">While Beauty inslaves his Soul .</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis Liberty only can please ,</l>
     <l n="4">And he that 's Fetter 'd is an Owl .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I found it very convenient and happy to dis-ingage from Love , and I have wond'red a thousand times at the Follies that God has made me commit : And though I som'times thought on Silvia , I thought her less charming and fair than she was before her fall ; and the Humour I now was in represented her no more meriting that Passion I once had for her , and I fancied she had lost all those Graces for which once I lov 'd her : In fine , I was so wholly recovered of my disease of Love for Silvia , that I began to be uneasie for want of employing my Addresses ; and a change from so violent a Passion to such a degree of coldness , became insupportable to one of my Youth and I natural Gayety ; insomuch , that I was seized with a Dulness , or Languishment , and so great a fit of Melancholy , as I had never felt the like ; and my Heart , that was so accustomed to Love , was so out of Humour , that it had no Object or Business for thought , that it lost all its Harmony and Wit ; it having nothing to excite it to Life and Motion , passing from so vast a degree of tenderness to an unconcern equally extream . I thought it rude , ill-bred , and idle , to live so indifferent and insignificant a Life . And walking perpetually by myself , ( or with those of my own Sex , that could not make my diversion ,) I sung all day this following Song to a Hum-drum Tune , to myself ;</p>
   <lg>

   <p>These were my notions of Life ; and I found myself altogether useless in the World without Love ; methought I had nothing to animate me to Gallant things , without Love , or Women : I had no use of Wit or Youth without the fair , and yet I did not wish wholly to ingage myself neither a second time , having been so ill-treated before by Love : But I found there were ways to entertain one 's self agreeably enough without dying or venturing the breaking of a heart for the matter : That there were Beauties to be obtained without the hazard of hanging or drowning one 's self : I never had tried , but I found it natural enough to my Humour and Constitution , to flatter and dissemble , swear and lye ; I viewed my self in my Glass , and found myself very well recovered from the Ruins my first Amour had made , and believed myself as fit for Conquest , as any Sir Fopling , or Sir Courtly Nice of ‘ em all . To this fine Person and good Meen and Shape , ( as I thought ,) I added handsom Dressing , the thing that takes the Heart infinitely above all your other Parts , and thus set out a snare for vain Beauty ; I every day went out of the City of Indifference , to see what new Adventures I could meet withal .</p>
   <p>One day I incountred a Woman , who , at first sight appeared very agreeable ; she had an Air easie , free , and Galliard ; such as fails not to take at first view : This was Coquettre , who , the very first time she saw me , Addrest herself to me with very great Complisance and good Humour , and invited me to her Apartment , where she assured me I should not fail to be entertained very agreeably ; and at the same time pulling out of her Pocket a Paper , she shewed me these Words written ;</p>

   <p>I gave her thanks for her good Counsel , and found I needed not much persuasion to follow Coquettre to a City that bears her Name , and I saw over the Gate of the City at my Entrance , these Verses writ in Gold Letters ;</p>

     <l n="21">All Jealousies , all Quarrels cease ,</l>
     <l n="22">And here Love lives in perfect Peace .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This agreeable description , gave me new desire to enter into the City ; where I incountred a thousand fine Persons all gloriously drest , as if they were purposely set out for Conquest : There was nothing omitted of Cost and Gallantry , that might render ‘ em intirely Charming , and they employ 'd all their Arts of Looks and Dress to gain Hearts .</p>
   <p>It is , in a word , from these fair Creatures you are to draw your Satisfaction , and ‘ tis indeed at a dear rate you buy it , yet , notwithstanding the Expence , a world of People persue ‘ em .</p>
   <p>When I came into the City , I was soon perceived to be a Stranger there , and while I was considering whither I should go , or how to address myself to these fair Creatures , a little Coquette Cupid presented himself to me for a kind Instructer ; and to explain him , this in a word is his Character :</p>
   <p>He is of the same Race with the other Cupids , has the same Mother too , Venus : He wears a Bow and Arrows , like the rest of the young Loves ; but he has no Bando , nothing to cover his Eyes , but he sees perfectly ; nor has he any Flambeau : And all the Laws of Coquettre he understands and observes exactly .</p>
   <p>I had no sooner received the little Charming God , but he instructed me in all the most powerful Arts to please , in all his little wiles and agreeable deceits ; all which he admits of as the most necessary Recourses to that great end of Man , his true diversion : With all which I was so extreamly pleased , that resolving to be his Votary , I followed him to the most delightful place in the World , the City of Gallantry .</p>
   <p>Gallantry is a City very magnificent ; at the Entrance of the Gate you incounter Liberality , a Woman of great Wit , delicate Conversation and Complisance : This Lady gives her Passport to all that enter , and without which , you cannot pass , or at least , with great difficulty ; and then too you pass your time but very ill ; and the more Pasports you have , the better you are received from the fair Inhabitants , and pass your time more agreeable with the fine Conversation you meet with in this City . Love told me this , and it was therefore that I took a great many Pasports from this acceptable Person Liberality . But what renders you yet more Favoured by the Fair and the Young who reside at Gallantry , is , to have a delicate soft Wit , an assiduous Address and a tender way of Conversing ; but that which best cullies and pleases the Generality of People there , is Liberality and Complisance : This place of so great Divertisement is re-frequented with all the Parties of the best and most amiable Company , where they invent a thousand new Pleasures every day ; Feasting , Balls , Comedies , and Sports , Singing and Serenades , are what employs the whole Four and twenty hours .</p>
   <p>By the Virtue of my Pasports from Liberality , I was introduced to all the fine Conversations and Places that afford Pleasure and Delight : I had the good Fortune to make Parties , insomuch , that I was soon known to all the Company in the City , and past the day in Feasting , going with the Young and Fair to delightful Villa 's , Gardens , or Rivers in Chases , and a thousand things that pleas 'd ; and the Nights I passed in Serenading , so that I did not give myself time for Melancholy ; and yet for all this I was wearied and fatigued ; for when once one has tasted of the Pleasure of Loving and being Beloved , all , that comes after that , is but flat and dull ; and if one 's Heart be not a little inflamed , all things else are insignificant , and make but very slight touches .</p>
   <p>I began therefore for all this to be extreamly Shagreen and out of Humour , amidst all these Pleasures , till one lucky day I met with an Adventure , that warmed my Heart with a tender flame which it had not felt since my happy beginning one for Silvia : One day , as I said , I was conducted by my officious Cupid into a Garden very beautiful , where there are a thousand Labyrinths and Arbours , Walks , Grotto 's , Groves and Thickets ; and where all the Fair and the Gay resorted ; ‘ twas here I incountred a young Beauty called Bellinda ; she was well made , and had an admirable meen , an Air of Gayety and Sweetness ; but that which charmed me most of all , was her Wit , which was too ingaging for me to defend my Heart against : I found mine immediately submitting to her Conversation , and you may imagine I did not part with her so long as Decency and good Manners permitted me to stay with her , which was as long as any Company was in the place ; nor then , till by my importunity I had gained so much upon her to suffer my Visits , which she did with a Condescention that gave me abundance of hope .</p>
   <p>I was no sooner gone , but my Cupid , who took care of me , and entertained me to the best Advantage , carried me that Evening to a Ball , where there were a world of Beauties , among the rest one fair as imagination can conceive ; she had all the Charmes of Youth and Beauty ; though not so much Wit and Air as Bellinda . To this young adorable I made my Court all the time I remained there , and fancied I never found myself so Charmed , I fancied all the Graces had taken up their dwelling in her Divine Face ; and that to subdue one so fair and so innocent , must needs be an extream Pleasure : Yet did I not so wholly fix my desires on this lovely Person , but that the Wit of Bellinda shared my Heart with the Beauty and Youth of Bellimante , so was this young Charmer called : I was extreamly well pleas 'd to find I could anew take fire ; and infinitely more , when I found I should not be subdued by one alone ; nor confined to dull Dotage on a single Beauty ; but that I was able to attain to the greatest Pleasure , that of Loving two amiable Persons at once : If with two , I hoped I might with Two score if I pleas 'd and had occasion ; and though at first it seemed to be very strange and improbable to feel a Passion for two , yet I found it true , and could not determin which I had the greatest tenderness for , or inclination to : But ‘ tis most certain , that this night I found , or thought I found , more for Bellimante , who fired me with every Smile ; I confess she wanted that Gayety of Spirit Bellinda had , to maintain that fire she raised : And ever when I was thoughtful a moment , Coquettre ( who is ever in all the Conversation , and where she appears very magnificent and with a great Train ,) would , smiling , sing softly in my Ear this Song , for she is very Galliard ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Cease to defend your Amorous Heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">Against a double flame ;</l>
     <l n="3">Where two may claim an equal Part</l>
     <l n="4">Without reproach or shame .</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Tis Love that makes Life 's happiness ,</l>
     <l n="6">And he that best wou 'd live</l>
     <l n="7">By Love alone must Life caress ,</l>
     <l n="8">And all his Darts receive .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Coquettre is a Person , that endeavours to please and humour every Body , but of all those who every day fill her Train , she caresses none with that Address and Assiduity as she did me , for I was a new Face , to whom she is ever most obliging and entertaining . However , notwithstanding the Advice of Coquettre , I fancied this young Charmer had engaged all my Soul ; and while I gazed on her Beauty , I thought on Bellinda no more ; but believed I should wholly devote myself to Bellimante , whose Eyes alone seemed capable to inflame me .</p>
   <p>I took my leave with Sighs , and went home extream well pleas 'd with this days Adventure . All this Night I slept as well as if no tenderness had toucht my Heart , and though I Lov 'd infinitely , it gave me no disturbance ; the next morning a thousand pleasant things Bellinda had said to me , came into my mind , and gave me a new inclination to entertain myself with that witty Beauty ; and dressing myself in haste with the desire I had to be with her , I went again , the morning being very inviting , to the Garden , where before I had seen her , and was so lucky to encounter her ; I found her blush at my approach ; which I counted a good Omen of my future happiness ; she received me with all the Gayety and Joy good liking and Wit could inspire : Nor was I backward on my part , but addrest myself to her with all imaginable respect , and as much Love in my Eyes as I was able to put on ; which , I found , she saw with Pleasure ; she had not entertained me half an hour , but I was so absolutely charmed , that I forgot there was a Bellimante in the World .</p>
   <p>Thus for several days I lived ; every day visiting both these attracting Beauties , and at Night , when I was retired , was not able to inform myself which I liked best : Both were equally beloved , and it was now , that methought I began to tast of true Joy ; I found myself in Love without any sort of inquietude ; when I was Melancholy , I went to visit Bellinda , and she with her Gayety and Wit would inspire me with good Humour ; If I were over-prest with good Company , and too much Conversation and Noise , I would visit Bellimante , who by a certain softness in her discourse , and a natural Languishment in her Eyes and Manners , charmed and calmed me to a reposed tranquillity ; so that to make me fortunate in Love , I could not have fixed my desires better : I had too little Love to be wretched , and enough to make my happiness and Pleasure .</p>
   <p>After I had past my time awhile thus in Coquettre , this little Love , who was my Guide , carried me to Declaration : I thought then upon the time of my first Arrival on the Isle of Love ; and how Respect , that awful hinderer of our Pleasure , prevented me from going to this Place : I urg 'd this very argument Respect then made me , to my Coquet Love now , who for answer return 'd me nothing but loud Laughter ; and when I askt his reason , he replied , that Respect did not forbid any to go to Declaration , but those only who knew not how to behave themselves well there , and who were not so well fashion 'd and bred as they ought to be , who go thither : And that it was a mere cheat in Respect to conduct people to Love by Discretion , that being much the farthest way about , and under favor to Monsieur Respect he is but a troublesome companion to a Lover , who designs to cure those wounds the fair has given him , and , if he have no better counsellor , he may languish all his life without revealing the secret of his soul to the object belov 'd , and so never find redress . But this Sir Formal , ( Respect says Love ,) is a very great favourite of the Lady 's , who is always in fee with them as a Jilt with a Justice ; who manages their Fools just as they wou 'd have ‘ em ; for it is the most agreeable thing in the World to them , and what the most feeds their vanity , to see at their feet a thousand Lovers sigh , burn , and languish ; the fair are never angry to find themselves belov 'd , nor ever weary of being Ador 'd . I was extreamly pleas 'd at this frank Humour of my little Love who told me this , and without much scruple or consideration to Respect I followed him towards Declaration , and in my way he gave me this Advice .</p>

   <p>By this time we were arriv 'd to Declaration , which is a very little Village , since it is only for Passengers to pass thro , and none live there , the Country is very Perilous , and those that make a false step run a great risque of falling from some precipice : Round about rises a very great mist , and people have much ado to know each other ; of these mists there are two sorts : The one on the side of Denial , the other on that of Permission , the first is very disagreeable and draws a very ill consequence with it ; the other directs you to a place of intire divertisement , but I had so good a guide that the entrance gave me no trouble at all . When I came to the Village , I found Bellimante , and Bellinda , to whom by turns I told all my heart ; and discover 'd all its passion or its tenderness which was to me much better .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When to the charming Bellinda I came ,</l>
     <l n="2">With my heart full of Love and desire ,</l>
     <l n="3">To gain my wisht end I talkt of a flame ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of sighing , and dying , and fire ,</l>
     <l n="5">I swore to her charms that my soul did submit ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the slave was undone by the force of her Wit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">To fair Bellimante the same tale I told ,</l>
     <l n="8">And I vow 'd and I swore her fair Eyes</l>
     <l n="9">No Heart-Ravisht mortal cou 'd ever behold</l>

     <l n="11">And while I was vowing , the ardour of youth</l>
     <l n="12">Made myself even believe what I swore was all Truth .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I confess to you , my dear Lysander , that it was a great while before I cou 'd make myself be believ 'd by Bellinda , or gain any credit upon her heart , she had a great deal of Wit and cou 'd see farther into the designs of her Lovers than those who had not so much , or had had so many vows pay 'd them : I perceiv 'd well enough , I was not hated by her , and that she had not a heart wholly insensible ; so that I never quitted her till I had gain 'd so much upon her to accompany me to Permission , where for some time we pass our days very pleasantly ; and having so good fortune with Bellinda , I had now a great desire to try my power over Bellimante : and where indeed , contrary to my expectation , I was not so happy : But she went from me to Denial ; and I was for that hour oblig 'd to return again to Bellinda , it was some time I searcht her in vain , but at last found her at a little Village , extreamly agreeable . There are very few Inhabitants , but those that are live in perpetual union , yet do not talk much , for they understand one another with half words : A sign of the Hand , the Head or the Eye , a glance or smile is sufficient to declare a great part of the Inclination . It is here where the Lover takes all freedoms , without controul , and says and does all that soft Love can permit : And every day they take and give a secret Entertainment , speaking a particular Language , which every body does not understand , and none but Lovers can reply to ; in effect , there are as many Languages as there are persons .</p>
   <p>The Governess of this Village is very charming to those that are acquainted with her ; and as disagreeable to those that are not ; she is a person of a great deal of Wit , and knows all things . She has a thousand ways to make herself understood , and comprehends all in a moment , that you wou 'd or can say to her .</p>
   <p>In this place , to divert , we make a thousand pretty sorts of Entertainments ; and we have abundance of Artifices , which signify nothing , and yet they serve to make life Agreeable and Pleasant .</p>
   <p>‘ Twas thus I liv 'd at Intelligence ; when I understood that Bellimante was retir 'd to Cruelty . This news afflicted me extreamly , but I was not now of a humour to swell the Floods with my tears , or increase the rude winds with my ruder sighs ; to tear my hair and beat my Innocent breast as I us 'd in my first Amour to do . However I was so far concern 'd that I made it my business not to lose this insensible fair one , but making her a visit in spight of her retreat , I reproacht her with cruelty .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Why , fair Maid , are you uneasy ,</l>
     <l n="2">When a slave designs to please you ;</l>
     <l n="3">When he at your feet is lying</l>
     <l n="4">Sighing , languishing , and dying ?</l>
     <l n="5">Why do you preserve your charms</l>
     <l n="6">Only for offensive Armes ?</l>
     <l n="7">What the Lover wou 'd possess</l>
     <l n="8">You maintain but to oppress .</l>
     <l n="9">Cease , fair Maid , your cruel sway ,</l>
     <l n="10">And let your Lover dy a nobler way .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Who the Devil wou 'd not believe me as much in love now as I ever was with Silvia : My heart had learnt then all the soft Language of Love which now it cou 'd prattle as naturally as its Mother Tongue ; and sighing and dying was as ready for my mouth as when it came from my very heart ; and cost me nothing to speak ; Love being as cheaply made now by me as a barter for a Horse or a Coach ; and with as little concern almost : It pleas 'd me while I was speaking , and while I believ 'd I was gaining the vanity and pleasure of a conquest over an unvanquisht heart . However I cou 'd yet perceive no Grist come to my Mill ; no heart to my Lure ; young as it was , it had a cunning that was harder to deceive than all Bellinda 's Wit : And seeing her persist still in her Resolution I left her with a heart , whose pride more than Passion resented the obdurat'ness of this Maid , I went as well compos 'd however as I cou 'd to Intelligence ; and found even some pleasure in the cruelty and charming resistance of Bellimante , since I propos 'd to myself an infinite happiness in softening a heart so averse to Love , and which I knew I shou 'd compel to yield some time or other with very little pains and force .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="4">Yet her fear a ruin sees .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>I feigned nevertheless abundance of Grief to find her still persist in her rigorous Cruelty ; and I made her believe that all my absent hours I abandoned myself to sorrows and despairs ; though Love knows I parted with all those things in Silvia 's Arms . But whatever I pretended , to appear at Cruelty and before Bellimante ; at Intelligence I was all Galliard and never in better Humour in my Life than when I went to visit Bellinda : I put on the Gravity of a Lover , and beheld her with a Solemn Languishing Look : In fine , I accustomed myself to counterfeit my Humour , whenever I found it convenient for my Advantage : Tears , Vows , and Sighs cost me nothing , and I knew all the Arts to jilt for Love , and could act the dying Lover , whenever it made for my Satisfaction .</p>

   <p>In fine , after I had sufficiently acted the Languishing Lover , for the accomplishment of all my Wishes , I thought it time to change the Scene , and without having recourse to Pity , I followed all the Counsels of my Cupid ; who told me , that in stead of dying and whining at her Feet , and damning myself to obtain her Grace , I should affect a Coldness , and an Unconcern ; for , Lycidus , assure yourself , said he , there is nothing a Woman will not do , rather than lose her Lover either from Vanity or Inclination . I thanked Love for his kind Advice ; and to persue it , the next day I drest myself in all the Gayety imaginable : My Eyes , my Air , my Language , were all changed ; and thus fortified with all the put-on indifference in the World , I made Bellimante a Visit ; and after a thousand things all cold and unconcerned , far from Love or my former Softness , I cried laughing to her ;</p>

   <p>Having said all this with an Air of Disdain , I , smiling , took my leave , with much less Civility and Respect than I used to do : and hasting to Intelligence , I past my time very well with Bellinda , to whom I paid all my Visits , and omitted nothing that might make Bellimante know I had forgot her : But at the end of some days by a very happy change , she finding more inclination to Love than to Cruelty , banishing all Obstacles in Favour of a Lover , she came to Intelligence ; where at first sight she made me some little Reproaches , and that in so soft a manner , that I did not doubt but I had toucht her Heart : I swore a thousand times , that all I had done , was only put on to see if it were possible she could resent it , and force from her Heart some little concern for my supposed loss . At this time I had abundance of Intreagues upon my hands , for it was not with Bellinda and Bellimante , with whom I lived in this manner ; and indeed it is impossible to remain at Intelligence and to make a Court but to two Persons only , where there are so many of the Fair and Young . I writ every day several Billets ; and received every day as many : I had every day two or three Rendezvous ; and one ought to manage matters very discreetly , that neither Party might come to the knowledge of the others concern ; and one ought to be a Man of great Address and Subtilty to love more than one securely ; and though this gave me some pain , it was nevertheless an Embarrass very agreeable , and in which I could have lived a great while ; if Envy , which cannot suffer any Body to be happy in Intelligence , had not arrived there and told a great many things which discovered my Intreagues ; so that Bellinda , with whom I had lived there with great Tranquillity a long time , and Bellimante , with whom I was but just beginning to be happy , were both obliged to quit this delightful place , where we enjoyed many happy hours ; and they retired till the noise was a little over ; and with them all those who had afforded me any hope : If any one of these had stayed , I had been contented well enough and one might have consol 'd me for the loss of the other , but in one day to lose all that made my happiness , put me in such a Melancholy , I knew not for the present what to do for myself ; but Coquet Love conducted me to a Village , that gave me a new Pleasure : The scituation of it is marvellous , the Fields and the Groves all about it the most pleasant in the World ; the Meadows enamel 'd with Rivulets , which run winding here and there , and lose themselves in the Thickets and the Woods . In going , Love said to me : In absence it is in vain to abandon yourself to sorrow . Alas ! What signifies it to sigh night and day ; the Absent does not hear us ; nor can the most tender Affliction or Complaint render a Lover happy , unless the Fair One were present to hear all his Moans , then perhaps they might avail . There was reason in what he said , and I was pleas 'd and calm 'd ; and we arrived at the same time at this Village : All the Houses were fine , and pleasant , we saw all the Graces there by Fountains and by Flowery Springs , and all the Objects that could be imagined agreeable ; and the least amiable ones , we saw , gave us a Joy ! All the World that inhabit there contribute to Diversion ; and this place is called Amusement : Amusement is a young Boy , who stops and gazes at every thing that meets his Eyes , and he makes his Pleasure with every Novelty .</p>
   <p>As soon as I arrived at this Village I thought to divert myself , as others did ; and to hinder my Thoughts from fixing on the loss of my two Mistresses , and to banish from my mind the Chagrins their Absence gave me ; withdrawn from the fair Eyes of Bellimante , and the Charming Wit of Bellinda , and to give my sighing Heart a little ease ; upon a thousand Objects I formed my desires , and took a thousand Pleasures to divert my Melancholy : And all the time I lived at this dear place , I passed my time without any inquietude ; for every day afforded me new Objects to give me new Wishes . And I now expected , without much impatience , the return of Bellinda and Bellimante ; nor did I tire myself with writing to ‘ em every day ; and when I did write , to save the expence of thought , the same Billet served both ; a thousand little tender things I said of course to both : And sometimes , especially while I was writing , I thought I had rather seen them than have lived at Amusement , but since it was necessary they should be absent , I bore it with all the Patience I could ; sometimes we were in a fit of writing very regularly to one another , but on a sudden I received no Letters at all ; the reason of this was , they both understood I lived at Amusement , and had retired themselves to the Palace of Spight : I no sooner received this News , but I rendered myself there also ; it is a place where there is alwaies abundance of Tumult , Outrage , Quarrels and Noise : And Spight is a Person who eternally gives occasion of Discontent and Broil ; causing People often to fall out with those they love most , and to caress those they hate : But the Quarrels she occasions us with those we love , last but a very short season , and Love reconciles those differences that Spight obliges us to make : Tho ‘ tis sometime pleasant enough to see those we Love extreamly , and violently , fall into the highest rage , and say a thousand things injurious and unreasonable , and to swear all the Oaths that angry Love and Fury can inspire , never to see or converse with one another again , and in a moment after to grow calm , weep , and reunite ; to be perjured on both sides , and become more fond than ever they were .</p>

     <l n="3">How can they long angry be</l>
     <l n="4">Whose Hearts are full of tenderness ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In this Place there wou 'd be eternal War , but for a person who inhabits there , and is always the Mediator for Peace , ‘ tis he that assists to accommodate and bring the Lovers together . This is a very honest person , call 'd Right Understanding ; he brought me to Bellinda , whom I found accompani 'd with a Man that made her a thousand caresses ; at my approach she made as if she knew me not , which I took in such disdain , that I apply 'd myself to Spight , with a design to be reveng 'd on this Haughty scorner . In this humour I made a visit to Bellimante but found her as Implacable as Bellinda , whom no excuses , no reason , cou 'd reduce to the temper I had once seen her ; in a rage , ten times more than I was before , fill 'd with disdain and revenge I complain 'd of this treatment to my little Love , who immediately led me into a Grove , where the Beauties and the Graces us 'd to walk , to consult upon what return to make for my affront ; from one place to another we past on till we came to a little Thicket , on the other side of which , by a little Rivulet we cou 'd hear , but not see , two persons discoursing ; they were women , and one seemed in a violent Rage against her Lover , who had newly offended her , whilst the other strove in vain to reconcile her , but she went on , vowing to revenge herself with the next object she shou 'd Encounter that had but Wit , Youth , and fortune enough to Justify her Love , and make her conquest glorious ; her resolution agreeing so with mine , and her manner of speaking , gave me new hope and pleasure , and a great curiosity to see her face ; I found by her Resentment she was young and of Quality , and that alone was enough to make me resolve upon Addressing myself to her , and the other person had no sooner left her , but I advanced towards her , with as good a grace as I you 'd put on ; she was a little surprised , and blushing at first , but I soon reconcil 'd her to my conversation . I found her handsom enough to ingage me , and she was as well pleased with me as I was with her , both having the same design which was that of revenge , and you may Imagine , our business being the same , our entertainment was not at first extraordinary , but as my cause of Anger was more reasonable than hers , I began to find myself to soften into liking of this new fair one , who was called Cemena , and who , to spight her former Lover , endeavor 'd to be seen with me in all the publick places she cou 'd , which gave him Infinite torments of Jealousie . One day as I was walking with this Cemena in a place where the young and the fair frequent , Bellinda and Bellimante often passed by us , and saw us both well pleas 'd and in good humour ; I cou 'd perceive their colour goe and come , and that they were as uneasy at this object , as my heart you 'd wish , and by their quitting of the place immediately after , I was assured of all my hope , and believed I had gained my Point ; at the end of two or three days , one Morning walking alone in the same place I encountered Bellimante , who hap'ned to be attended with her Woman onely ; she chang 'd colour at my approach , and wou 'd have passed me by but I stay 'd her by the Robe ; and said a thousand things to her that angry Love inspir 'd me with , while she on her side did the same , till we had talk 'd ourselves by degrees into reason , and good understanding . I found her Resentment to be only the excess of Love , and all those faults are easily forgiven , I immediately threw myself at her Feet , and made her a thousand protestations of my fidelity , and she , in her turn excused herself with all the tenderness imaginable , she made me a thousand new vows and caresses , and forgot nothing that might perswade me that all she did was by Counsel of Spight .</p>

   <p>I found this accommodement extreamly agreeable , and it was in these transports the Lovely Bellimante detain 'd me for some days without quitting her , but I found too much Joy in a new reconciliation not to endeavour to make one also with Bellinda ; as soon then as Bellimante grew a little off my heart by so long a conversation with one and the same Woman , I , on pretence of some affairs , left her extreamly charm 'd and satisfi 'd , and hasted to Bellinda , who , methought , was now a new Beauty ; at least I found her too considerable to lose the Glory of ingaging her intirely ; ‘ tis possible that both these Ladies , being agitated with as little faith as myself , deceiv 'd me with the same design as I did them , to make their pleasure only , and tho this very often came into my thoughts , yet it gave me no great inquietude , they dissembl 'd well , and I cou 'd not see it ; I had the satisfaction and the vanity of ‘ em , that was as much as I desir 'd from any of the fair since Silvia toucht my heart , they both swore they lov 'd and both fear 'd to displease , if they were unfaithful they had a thousand stratagems to hide their infidelity , and took a great deal of care to keep me , which shew 'd a value in me above all the rest of my Rivals , and I beheld myself with some Pride and esteem for having so much power ; when ever they offended me they had all the Arts to mollify me , and who wou 'd be so critically in love as not to be willing to be so well abus 'd ? For my part I will not be so nice , as to penetrate into their thoughts , to find what wou 'd but displease me if found ; but content myself with all I see and find that looks like Love at least and good humour . Nay even in their worst I found a thousand pleasures , those of their quarrels which sometimes happen twenty times a day , when every reconciliation is like a new Mistress , so well they strive to please and be reconcil 'd .</p>
   <p>But all these pleasures did not satisfy me , there were greater yet behind which I had not arriv 'd to with these fair charmers , and however I liv 'd at Amusement , making a thousand Amours with a hundred of the most Beautiful , still I had a desire to subdue intirely to my pleasure these two the most hard to gain , but now I was pretty well secur 'd of both their hearts and yet neither knew they were each others Rivals in mine . They knew one another , converst , and play 'd and walkt together , yet so discreet I was in this Amour that neither was jealous of the other , nor suspected I lov 'd both with an equal Ardour ; when I hap'ned to be with ‘ em both I carried myself so equally Gallant that both commended my conduct and imagin 'd I did it to hide the secret passion I had for herself , and so many little Arts my Coquet Love had taught me I cou 'd with ease manage abundance of intrigues at one and the same time .</p>
   <p>But as I said , this did not suffice , nor cou 'd the fires that some more willing Beauties allay 'd , hinder me from wishing and burning and persuing those two fair persons with an Ardor that had no appearance of decay from any others goodness to me , but in my daily visits to ‘ em I eternally solicited them to suffer me to accompany them to that charming place call 'd Favors , which is a very Beautiful Castle rais 'd in a Vally . I confest to you that my Coquet Cupid advis 'd me not to go , for fear of attaching myself too much to a place so extreamly agreeable ; the Mountains , that environ this Castle , are very high and full of hollow Rocks , which made the scituation very sullen . The Castle itself was delicately built , and surrounded with tall Trees , so thick that one cou 'd hardly see the Edifice , nor cou 'd the Sun-beams dart throw the gloomy shade ; and eternal Night seem 'd to sit there in awful state and pleasure : For the more obscure this place is and secret from all Eyes , the better and more acceptable it is to all that enter there , and tho this Vally have many inhabitants , it appears to have none at all ; because they love solitude , and , banishing all Publick society , content themselves only to be but two in company together ; if there be more they are receiv 'd with a very ill welcome , for a third Person in this place wou 'd destroy the Pleasure and the harmony . The Inhabitants of this Castle never shew themselves but to those that are very importune , and then not every day , the Ladies that command there are many Sisters all of the name of the Castle ; and all very fair , and still one more fair than the other , and when you visit ‘ em you see ‘ em not all at once but by degrees and the last you behold is the fairest , and by the pleasure you have in seeing one , you desire to see ‘ em all . For there are no limits to be given to desire , and as they are never seen by any body altogether , it happens very often that you see but one , and you must have address and great assiduity , abstinence , and good fortune to obtain one of these Favors ; but the last will cost you much more trouble than all the rest put together , so very fair , so very nice and coy she is : But when once obtain 'd she brings you to the Palace of intire Pleasure ; which is neighbouring to the Castle of Favors ; but I , who wou 'd very fain , at once , have brought to this delicate place both Bellinda and Bellimante , found myself extream uneasy , because , as I said , only two can be well entertain 'd at a time ! I found it against my humour and against the advice of Love to abandon all , and retire with one only , for in decency and good manners , those , who go to this Castle of Favors , are oblig 'd to continue there for some time ; and I found , I shou 'd be extreamly chagrin after a little with one alone ; but both were obstinate and wou 'd not suffer a third : and having been so very importune with both , I was asham 'd to repent and recant all those things I had said , to persuade them to go , tho in my heart I was very ill satisfi 'd I had not persu 'd the counsel , Love had given me not to go to Favors at all ; he foreseeing an inconvenience in such a retreat , which I , with all my young desires about me and fond of novelty , cou 'd not , so well as he , discern ; however I had propos 'd it with some ardency and wou 'd not go back , but resolv 'd to make the best advantage of my voyage , and wou 'd not declare my regreet till I cou 'd no longer hinder it : So that Bellimante , yeilding to my Implorings , consented next day to go with me to this retreat of Favors .</p>
   <p>Accordingly the next morning we set out for this amiable place ; where we arrived , and finding myself all alone , without interruption or fear , with this very fair Creature , I advanced to a thousand Freedoms which she , with some resistance , permitted me to take : I was all Joy and Transport at every advance , and still the nearer I approached to the last Favour , the more blest I imagined myself ; I grew more resolved , and she more feeble ; and at last , I was the Victor and Bellimante the Victim ; I remained some days with her , and one would have imagined I should have been intirely happy in this place with one so young and fair : But behold the fickleness of , Youth , and Man 's nature .</p>

     <l n="12">What must Wit and Beauty too ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And though next day I found myself a hundred times more in Love with Bellimante than before , yet unless I could possess Bellinda too , I thought myself miserable : Yet every time she charmed me anew I was upon the point of renouncing eternally Bellinda , and sacrificing her to my Passion for Bellimante : But I did not remain long in that Humour , but every day grew more and more unresolved in that point ; and as Bellimante grew more fond I grew more cold ; not but I had learnt to say so many kind and soft things in the time of my real Passion with Silvia , that I found it easie to speak every day such endearing Words as gave her no doubt of my Heart ; nor was willing she should see to the bottom of it , where she would most certainly have found Bellinda ; yet with such a mixture of Passion for herself , that it would have been hard to have distinguished , which had had the ascendant there ; only my desire at present was the most considerable for the fair Object I had not yet possest , and whom I long 'd to vanquish ; perhaps , as much for the Glory as the Pleasure , though my Heart did not at this moment think so .</p>
   <p>After some time that I had lived here with Bellimante , I made some pretext to leave her for a little while ; she , who was extreamly charmed with that Solitude , resolved to wait there my return , so that I had some pain in contriving how I should bring Bellinda to the same Castle as I wished to do ; but it had in it many Mansions and Apartments , and , as I said , so retired from one another , that it was difficult to come at any time together or to meet : This consideration made me resolved , and very pressing with Bellinda , to go to this place , assuring her of such Diversion as she never met with in any other part of the World : She loved and was not long in persuading , and I had the Glory to conduct her in spight of all her Wit and Gayety , to this retreat of Solitude with me ; where , unperceived , I obliged her to render me all that Love could allow , and more than Honour would permit : And I was for some days extreamly happy , and possibly had continued so , ( going from one Apartment to another , and , like the Great Sultan , visiting by turns my Beauties ,) had not a malicious fate prevented my Grandeur and Pleasure .</p>
   <p>It hap'ned one day that I had sued a repetition of Favours from Bellinda ; she seeming resolved to grant me no more , repenting of those I had taken , and with a charming Sorrow reproaching me , making me a thousand times more pressing than before : At last her force growing weaker , her denials fainter , and my importunities more raging ; I found her yeilding , the Lily in her Face gave place to the Roses , and Love and Trembling made her Eyes more fair , and just ready to render me all . We saw approaching us Bellimante , who , having heard how I sometimes past my hours , resolved to surprise me in my perfidy ; and accordingly found us in a gloomy Arbour with all the Transports of Love in both our Faces , which it was too late to resettle and hide from this too sensible and jealous fair One : In vain I strove with all the Arguments of Love and Tenderness to appease her , or , if by anything I said , I found her inclined to pardon me , on the other side it but served to incense and enrage Bellinda , to whom I had made equal Vows ( at her coming to that place ,) of eternal Fidelity . I am not able to express to you , my dear Lysander , what confusion I found myself in , I divided my Heart and my Entreaties between ‘ em ; and knew not to which I most ardently meant ‘ em ; I was very sensible , that while I treated both with equal Love and Respect , that I should gain neither , and yet if what I said to both had been addrest to any one of ‘ em , it would have prevailed ; and I found it easie to have kept either , if I would resolve to quit the other ; but my heart not inclining to that , or if it wou 'd , not knowing which I shou 'd chuse , made me remain between ‘ em both the most out-of-countenanced coxcomb , that ever was taken in the cheats of Love , while both were on either side reproaching me with all the malice and noise imaginable , so that not being able longer to endure the clamour , I took my flight from ‘ em both , and ran with all the force I cou 'd to a Village call 'd Irresolution ; and where Coquet Love abandon 'd me saying that place was not proper for him .</p>
   <p>The Houses of this Village are for the most part not half built , but all appears very desolate and ruinous : It appertains to a Lady very fantastique of the same name . She makes a Figure pleasant enough , she never dresses herself , because she cannot determin what habit to put on ; she is ever tormenting herself , still turning to this side and to that , yet never stirs from the place , because undetermin 'd she knows not whither nor which way to go : And having so many in her mind resolves to go to neither ; one always sees an Agitation in her Eyes , that keeps them in perpetual motion and fixt on nothing . You see her perpetually perplext with a thousand designs in her head at once , but puts none of them in execution .</p>
   <p>I found myself in this place Embarrassed with a thousand confusions and thoughts , for Bellinda and Bellimante had equally shar 'd my soul , and I knew not for which I shou 'd declare ; nor whether the Wit and extream good Humour of the first were more powerful upon my heart , than the Beauty and softness of the last , so that I was wholly unable to determin which I shou 'd quit , having the same sentiments for one as the other , and resolv 'd to abandon both rather than content myself with one : And the fear of losing one was the occasion of my losing both , in fine I was in the most cruel incertainty in the World . And I cou 'd not forbear saying a thousand times to myself ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When Love shall two fair objects mix ,</l>
     <l n="2">And in the Heart two passions fix :</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis a pleasure too severe ,</l>
     <l n="4">Cruel Joy we cannot bear ,</l>
     <l n="5">Too much Love for two I own ,</l>
     <l n="6">But too little flame for one .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>While I was thus perplext betwixt these two violent passions , when no reason cou 'd resolve me which to choose , as I was one day meditating what to do in this extremity , a Woman presented herself to me , whose Beauty was infinitely transcending all I had ever beheld ; she had a noble and Majestick meen , a most Divine Air , and her charms cast so great a Lustre that I was dazzl 'd with Gazing on her ; she struck me with so profound a respect at the first sight of her Glory 's , that I cou 'd not forbear throwing myself at her feet , imploring I might be eternally permitted to Adore her ; and to become her slave . When raising me from the ground , and looking on me with Eyes more Majestick than kind , she said to me in a loud voyce :</p>

   <p>Those words , repeated to me with an Air haughty and imperious , toucht me to the very Soul , and made me blush a thousand times with shame to behold myself in that ridiculous state , almost reduc 'd to the same tenderness for Bellinda and Bellimante I had before had for Silvia ; but I soon found my error and in an instant became more in Love with Glory than I had ever been in my life . Insomuch that I resolv 'd to leave Irresolution and follow her . I confess at first it gave my heart som little pain to withdraw and dis-ingage it from so long and so fond a custom , and I was more than once forc 'd to parley thus with my intractable and stubborn heart .</p>

   <p>Thus , my dear Lysander , following Glory , I soon arriv 'd at the extent of the Island of Love , and there I incounter 'd a thousand Beauties , Attractions , Graces and Agreements ; all which endeavor 'd anew , but in vain , to engage me . I past by ‘ em all without any regard only sight , as I beheld ‘ em with the remembrance , how once the meanest of those Beauties wou 'd have charm 'd me . I lookt back on all those happy shades , who had been conscious of my softest pleasures , and a thousand times I sighing bid ‘ em farewell ; the Rivers , Springs and Fountains had my wishes that they might still be true and favor Lovers , as they had a thousand times done me . These dear remembrance , you may believe , stay 'd some time with me , yet I wou 'd not for an Empire have return 'd to ‘ em again , nor have liv 'd that life over anew I had so long and with so much pleasure persu 'd .</p>
   <p>After this I took a Vessel and put off from that shore , where , tho I had met with many Misfortunes , I had also receiv 'd a thousand joys : While it was in view I found myself toucht with some regret , but being sail 'd out of sight of it , I sigh 'd no more , but bid adieu to fond Love for ever .</p>

     <l n="1">To SIR WILLIAM CLIFTON .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Sir ,</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I am very sensible how the ill-natur 'd World has been pleased to Judge of almost all Dedications , and when not addrest to themselves will not let ‘ em pass without the imputation of Flattery ; for there is scarce any Man so just to allow those Praises to another in which he does not immediately share in some degree himself , nor can the Fantastic Humors of the Age agree in point of Merit , but every Mans Vertue is measured according to the sence another has of it , and not by its own intrinsic value , so that if another does not see with my Eyes and judge with my Sence , I must be Branded with the Crime of Fools and Cowards ; nor will they be undeceived in an Error that so agreeably flatters them , either by a better knowledge of the Person commended , or by a right understanding from any other Judgment ; they hate to be convinced of what will make no part of their satisfaction when they are so , for as ‘ tis natural to despise all those that have no vertue at all , so ‘ tis as natural to Envy those we find have more than our selves instead of imitating ‘ em : and I have heard a Man rail at a Dedication for being all over Flattery , and Damn it in gross , who when it has been laid before him , and he has been asked to answer according to his Conscience , and upon Honour to every particular , could not contradict one single Vertue that has been justly given there , yet angry at being convinced has cry 'd , with a peevish , uneasie tone .— YET I DON'T KNOW HOW , NOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT-BUT ‘ TIS ALL TOGETHER METHINKS A PIECE OF FLATTERY — When indeed the business was , he did not know how to afford him so good a Character , nor he did not know what other reason he had to find fault with it , and was only now afflicted to find ‘ twas all true ; whereas before he charged it all on the effects of some little sinister end or advantage of the Author .</p>
   <p>‘ Tis therefore , Sir , that I have taken the Liberty here of addressing my self to one , whose Generosity and Goodness has prevented any such Scandal , and secured me from the imputation of Flattery by rend'ring this , but a small part of that Duty only , which I have so long owed you ; ‘ tis only , Sir , my debt of gratitude I pay , or rather an humble acknowledgment of what I ought to pay you ; for favours of that nature are not easily returned , and one must be a great while discharging it out of the Barren Stock of Poetry ; but where my own failed , I borrowed of my Friends , who were all ready to give me Credit for so good and just an occasion , and we all soon agreed where first we should begin the work of gratitude . For , Sir , your worth is every where known , and valued ; it bears the Royal stamp and passes for currant to every ready hand ; Loyalty being that standard Vertue of the Soul which finds its price all over the World ; nor is it in these our glorious days , who bears that Rate now , but who has always done so through Fate and Fortune ; dyed in the true Grain , not to be varied with every glittering Sun-shine , nor lost in every falling Shower , but stanch to its first beautiful colour , endures all weathers .</p>
   <p>Nor is it enough that where you are known , you are beloved and blest , but you , whose Quality and Fortune elevate you above the common Crowd , ought to have your Loyal Names fixed every where , as great and leading Examples to the rest , as the Genius of your Country and the Star that influences , where your Lustre shines . You , who in spight of all the Follies we import from France so much in fashion here , still retain , and still maintain the good old English Customs of Noble Hospitality , and treat the underworld about you , even into good nature and Loyalty ; and have kept your Country honest , while elsewhere for want of such great Patrons and Presidents , Faction and Sedition have over-run those Villages where Ignorance abounded , and got footing almost every where , whose Inhabitants are a sort of Bruits , that ought no more to be left to themselves than Fire , and are as Mischievous and as Destructive . While every great Landlord is a kind of Monarch that awes and civilizes ‘ em into Duty and Allegiance , and whom because they know , they Worship with a Reverence equal to what they would pay their King , whose Representative they take him at least to be if not that of God himself , since they know no greater or more indulgent ; and are sure to be of his opinion , he 's their Oracle , their very Gospel , and whom they 'll sooner credit ; never was new Religion , Misunderstanding , and Rebellion known in Countries till Gentlemen of ancient Families reformed their way of living to the new Mode , pulled down their great Halls , retrenched their Servants , and confined themselves to scanty lodgings in the City , starved the Poor of their Parish , and rackt their Tenants to keep the Tawdry Jilt in Town a hundred times more expensive , but you , Sir , retain still the perfect measure of true Honour , you understand the joys and comforts of life and blest retreat ; you value Courts tho you do not always shine there , you dare be brave , liberal , and honest tho you do not always behold the Illustrious Pattern of all Glorious Vertue in your King , and absent from the lavish City . You are pleased and contented with the favour of your Monarch , tho you have no need of his Bounty , dare serve him with your Life and Fortune , and can find your reward in your own Vertue and Merit ; this I dare avow to all the World is your Character in short , for which your lasting Name shall live , when the turbulent , busie hot-brain 'd disturbers of their own tranquillity and the Kingdoms Peace , shall live in fear , die in Shame and their memory rot in the forgotten Grave , or stand to after Ages Branded and Reproached , while we can never enough Celebrate that Glorious one of yours ; nor knew we where to fix it to render it Durable to all Eternity so well as to lasting Verse , that out-wears Time and Marble . If anything within can contribute to the diversion of your Hours of least concern , ‘ twill be sufficient recompence to all who beg your Patronage here , especially</p>
   <p>Sir , Your obliged and most humble Servant , A. BEHN .</p>

    <p n="67">p. 115 , l. 3 Viscount Cramborn and Baron of Islington . So 1684 ; but ‘ Cramborn ’ should be ‘ Cranborn ’ , and for ‘ Islington ’ we should read ‘ Essingdon . ’ Possibly Mrs. Behn sent the Dedicatory Epistle to press as an afterthought at the last moment and did not see a proof . Though she was frequently careless , such mistakes as ‘ Cramborn ’ and ‘ Islington ’ would seem to be chargeable to her printers .</p>
    <p n="68">p. 125 , l. 32 . Forsake their Kinds . Query ‘ their Kids ’ .</p>

    <p n="71">p. 144 , l. 11 The Sun and Spring receive but our short Light . This , the reading of 1684 , is clearly corrupt but can be easily mended by changing ‘ receive ’ to ‘ revive ’ .</p>

    <p n="150">p. 4 Peter Weston , Esq . Peter Weston , the second son of a Cheshire clergyman , was born in 1665 . He matriculated at Brasenose College , Oxford , and afterwards proceeding to the Inner Temple ( 1683 ) was called to the Bar in 1697 . He attained considerable eminence in his profession . Foster , Alumni Oxon . has : ‘ Weston , Peter s. Tho . of Chester ( city ) cler . Brasenose Coll . matric . 10 June 1681 aged 16 ; bar . at law Inner Temple , 1697 . ’ The Inner Temple Admission Register gives : ‘ Petrus Weston .

Septimo die Februarii Anno Domini 1683 ( i. e . 1683 / 4 ) . ’ In the Inner Temple Records , amongst the Bench Table Orders , is noted , 27-9 January , 1696-7 : ‘ that Peter Weston be called to the bar ’ , and again 31 January following , we have : ‘ Peter Weston 's call to the bar respited . ’ Doubtless Weston was a friend of Hoyle , and by him introduced to the circle which surrounded Mrs. Behn .</p>
    <p n="151">p. 7 Charles Cotton . Charles Cotton was born at Ovingdean ( Sussex ) , 28 April , 1630 . Upon coming into his estate he found it heavily encumbered , and probably as much from necessity as from natural inclination turned to literary work . He produced a large number of poems , translations , panegyrics , prominent amongst which is his Scarronides , or Virgil Travestie ( 1664 ) . He will be remembered by his best lyrics , his Second Part of the Compleat Angler , and his version of Montaigne . Cotton , who seems to have been continually harassed with pecuniary difficulties , was a gay liver , albeit an intimate of Isaak Walton . He died 1687 .</p>
    <p n="152">p. 7 two Orinda 's . ‘ The matchless Orinda ’ was Mrs. Katherine Philips ( nee Fowler ) , precieuse and poetess ( 1631-64 ) . After marriage the lady divided her time between London and her husband 's house at Cardigan , where she was the centre of a circle of admirers and friends who adopted various fanciful names , e. g . Silvander ( Sir Edward Dering ) , Antenor ( her husband ) . Her verses and a translation of Corneille 's Pompee ( Dublin , 1663 ) became famous . At the height of her popularity she died of smallpox at a house in Fleet Street , 22 June , 1664 . For an excellent account of her see Gosse , Seventeenth Century Studies .</p>
    <p n="153">p. 8 N. Tate . Nahum Tate , born in Dublin , 1652 , was educated at Trinity College . He does not appear to have followed any definite profession . Coming to London he produced much miscellaneous literary work , and was even entrusted by Dryden with a portion of the second part of Absalom and Achitophel ( 1682 ) , the master himself enriching it with some two hundred lines . Tate succeeded ( 24 December , 1692 ) Shadwell in the laureateship which he did not hold till his death ( 12 August , 1715 ) as Rowe was appointed to that post , 1 August , 1715 . His plays are perhaps not so mediocre as they are often judged to be , but they have been damned by his outrageous mangling of King Lear ( 1681 ) , which , none the less , persevered on the stage for many a long decade .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Perhaps he is chiefly known for this , and a version of the Psalms ( the first twenty appeared in 1695 ) written in conjunction with Nicholas Brady ( 1696 ) .</p>

    <p n="160">p. 75 Varrio . Antonio Verrio , the celebrated Neapolitan painter , was born at Lecce , in the Terra di Otranto , about 1639 . His earliest pictures were done for ecclesiastics — the Jesuits College , Naples , the high altar in the Carmelite Church , Toulouse . His facility of execution and rich colouring gained him fame , and Charles II appointed him to direct the royal tapestry works at Mortlake . Soon , however , Verrio was transferred to Windsor to paint the walls and ceilings . Under Charles II and his successor Verrio was in high favour . At the Revolution he threw up his office of surveyor of the royal gardens ( a sinecure ) and refused to employ his pencil for William of Orange . He had , however , many commissions from nobles and private persons . His sight failing , Queen Anne bestowed on him a pension of L200 a year . He died 1707 . A list of Verrio 's ceilings will be found in Jesse 's Eton and Windsor . Pope , Windsor Forest , has a couplet ( 307-8 ):—</p>

    <p n="162">p. 75 Gibbon . Grinling Gibbons , the celebrated sculptor in wood , was born at Rotterdam , 4 April , 1648 . He came to London in 1667 . He was first brought into notice by Evelyn , who introduced him to the King . Charles II gave Gibbons a place in the board of works . Besides being employed at Windsor , Gibbons decorated other of the royal palaces in marble sculpture as well as wood . His exquisite carvings are to be found in many noble houses . They are unrivalled for their presentment of foliage , fruit , flowers ; of a marvellous delicacy and beauty . In 1714 he was appointed master carver to George I . He died at his house in Bow Street , 3 August , 1721 .</p>
    <p n="163">p. 76 noble Clifdon . Evelyn , 23 July , 1679 , writes : ‘ To Court : after dinner I visited that excellent painter , Verrio , whose works in fresco in the King 's palace , at Windsor , will celebrate his name as long as those walls last .... I went to Clifden , that stupendous natural rock , wood , and prospect , of the Duke of Buckingham 's , buildings of extraordinary expense . The grots in the chalky rock are pretty : it is a romantic object , and the place altogether answers the most poetical description that can be made of solitude , precipice , prospect , or whatever can contribute to a thing so very like their imaginations . The stand somewhat like Frascati as to its front , and , on the platform , is a circular view to the utmost verge of the horizon which , with the serpenting of the Thames , is admirable . The staircase is for its materials singular ; the cloisters , descents , gardens , and avenue through the wood , august and stately ; but the land all about wretchedly barren , and producing nothing but fern . Indeed , as I told his Majesty that evening ( asking me how I liked Clifden ) without flattery , that it did not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect and park , wch is without compare ; there being but one only opening and that narrow , wch led one to any variety , whereas , that of Windsor is everywhere great and unconfined . ’</p>

    <p n="167">p. 76 Sir Samuel Morland , or Sir Robert Gorden . Sir Samuel Morland , the celebrated inventor and projector , was born in 1625 . Having served the Commonwealth , he turned royalist , and on Cromwell 's death joined the King at Breda . He was rewarded at the Restoration with a baronetcy , a pension , and the appointment of Master of Mechanics to the King . He devoted himself to practical science , and his house was long the resort of the curious to view his models , inventions , &amp; c. In a MS. ( Harleian ) treatise he shows an accurate knowledge of steam power and explains how it can be employed to work cylinders in raising water , a subject to which he had paid particular attention , having brought water from a considerable distance to the top of Windsor Castle . He died blind and in penury , 30 December , 1695 .</p>
    <p n="168">Sir Robert Gordon , Bart . was born 7 March , 1647 . He became famous for his scientific pursuits , and in the neighbourhood of Gordonstown ( Elginshire ) , his birthplace , he was long known as ‘ Sir Robert the Warlock ’ . A MS. account of the family says : he was ‘ particularly skilled in mechanics and chemistry .... He contrived a curious machine or pump for raising water , wch was tried in the Fleet and highly approved of , and found far to exceed anything of that kind then known , both for the facility of working and the quantity of water it discharged . ’ Gordon sat in the Scotch parliament , and seems to have been a favourite with James II , who was interested in his experiments . He died 1704 .</p>

He married Frances , one of the three daughters and coheiresses of Simon Bennet of Beechampton , Bucks , when she was only thirteen years old . A firm Tory , he was in 1688-9 committed to the Tower as a recusant , but the prosecution was waived . His name was forged by Robert Young to a document purporting to be that of an Association to seize the Prince of Orange , and declare for King James . On this account he was a second time committed to the Tower , 7 May , 1692 , but as nothing could be proved his bail was soon formally discharged in the Court of King 's Bench . He died 25 October , 1693 , leaving an only son , three years old , who succeeded him . He was buried at Hatfield , 29 October .</p>

He was imprisoned 28 February , 1684-5 on a charge of libelling the Church in his Paraphrase of the New Testament ( 1685 ) . His sermons , devotional and other writings amount to nearly two hundred .</p>

A . 1686 , and is mentioned as a Professor of Theology , whence we infer that he took Orders . In 1712 he was ‘ Collegii Regalis Praepositus ’ . He prefixed a copy of complimentary verses ( 1 January , 1682 ) , to Creech 's Lucretius , and was also a contributor to Dryden 's Miscellany .</p>
    <p n="182">John Adams , the celebrated topographer , who in 1680 laboriously drew up the Index Villaris , a gazetteer dedicated to Charles II , was a barrister of the Inner Temple , and must be carefully distinguished from the Cambridge litterateur .</p>

Having studied hard he graduated M. A . 13 June , 1683 ( B. D . 18 March , 1696 ) , and was elected a Fellow of All Souls , 1 November , 1683 . For two years ( 1694-6 ) he was headmaster of Sherborne , and then returned to Oxford . Melancholia , however , grew upon him , and after accepting the college living of Welwyn ( where he never resided ) he committed suicide , his body being discovered ( June , 1700 ) , in a garret in his lodging at the house of an apothecary named Ives . Creech 's translation of Lucretius was printed at Oxford , 1682 . It is of value , and Munro in his edition of the poet speaks of his predecessor as ‘ a man of sound sense and good taste ’ , no mean praise from so great a scholar .</p>

Printed at Antwerpen . [ London . ] 1680 ? In The Works of the Earls of Rochester , Roscommon , Dorset , 1712 ; 1718 ; 1731 ; 1739 ( in which year there were two several and slightly divergent editions ) ; 1752 ; 1800 ? It must not , however , be for a moment supposed that the Earl of Rochester has any claim to the authorship of this piece . Unscrupulous booksellers collected songs , poems , satires of every kind under his name and included them amongst his oft-reprinted works without explanation or discrimination . With the opening lines of this poem cf . Horace , Sermonum , i , viii :—</p>

    <p n="203">p. 151 Mr. Grinhil . John Greenhill , the famous portrait-painter , was born at Salisbury about 1644 . He was the eldest son of the registrar of the diocese of Salisbury . About 1662 he migrated to London and became a pupil of Sir Peter Lely . Almost instant success awaited him , and his progress proved so rapid as to excite the master 's jealousy . He married early , and was at first industrious . After a few years , however , he became a boon companion of the free-living theatrical and literary circles of the day , and fell into irregular habits . 19 May , 1676 , whilst returning from the Vine Tavern , Greenhill fell into the gutter in Long Acre , was carried to his lodging in Lincoln 's Inn Fields where he died that same night . He is buried in St. Giles-in-the-Fields . Amongst his portraits , which are highly esteemed , are those of Charles II ; James , Duke of York ; Shaftesbury ; Locke ; Davenant ; Cowley ; William Cartwright , the actor . This Poem on Greenhill 's death has been included amongst Poems on Several Occasions by the Rt . Hon . the Earl of R —— Printed at Antwerpen . [ London . ] 1680 ?

    <p n="205">p. 156 Our Cabal . Considerable research has unhappily failed to identify most of the personages whose initials appear in this poem . Mr. J. H ., however , is John Hoyle , Mrs. Behn 's well-known intimate , to whom so many of her poems are addressed . In The Muses Mercury for January , 1708 , the verses for Mr. E. B. and Mrs. F. M. are given with this note : ‘ The following poem was written by Mrs. Behn on one Mr. Edward Butler and Mrs. Masters , and is a Description of the Success of their Passion , in a little Journey took into the Country , with many more Gentlemen and Ladies of that Time , whom we shall speak of hereafter ': a promise which was never fulfilled .</p>
    <p n="206">p. 163 The Willing Mistriss . This song was reprinted in The Muses Mercury , December , 1707 , when it is termed ‘ A Song for J.

He graduated B. A . 25 June , 1654 , M. A . three years later . He took his B. D . and D. D . 3 July , 1669 . From 30 June , 1657 to 24 March , 1670 ( when he resigned ) , he held a Wadham fellowship . Cowley , in his Ode to the Royal Society , had praised Sprat 's History of the Royal Society of London ( 1667 ) , and when Cowley died , in 1667 , Sprat wrote An Account of the Life of Mr. Abraham Cowley .</p>

    <p n="211">p. 171 To Mrs. W. i. e . Anne Wharton , born in Oxfordshire about 1632 , second daughter and coheiress of Sir Henry Lee , third baronet of Ditchley , by Anne , daughter of Sir John Danvers of Cornbury ; 16 September , 1673 , she married as his first wife Thomas Wharton ( afterwards first Marquis of Wharton ) , to whom she brought L10 , 000 dowry and L2 , 500 a year . The match proved childless and unhappy , and it was only owing to Burnet 's persuasions that she did not separate from her husband in 1682 . She died at Adderbury , 29 October , 1685 , and was buried at Winchendon on 10 November following . Anne Wharton 's Elegy on the Death of the Earl of Rochester , which may be found in Examen Miscellaneum ( 1702 ) , drew a poem from Waller in which he says that she</p>
    <p n="212">Shews that still in her he lives . Her Wit is graceful , great , and good , Ally 'd in Genius , as in Blood .</p>
    <p n="213">The earl 's mother was aunt to Mrs. Wharton 's father , Sir Henry Lee . Rochester died 26 July , 1680 . On p. 242 of The Temple of Death , a miscellany ( 1695 ) , may be read Mrs. Wharton 's ‘ To Mrs. A. Behn , on what she Writ of the Earl of Rochester ’ . Various other of her poems have appeared in similar collections .</p>

    <p n="217">p. 177 Song to Ceres . The Wavering Nymph ; or , Mad Amyntas was the name given to a Restoration revival of Randolph 's beautiful and truly poetic Amyntas or The Impossible Dowry .

    <p n="219">Oxford , Printed by Leonard Lichfield for Francis Bordman , 1638 .</p>
    <p n="220">In the pastoral , Ceres , by an obscure oracle , has announced the dowry to be given to Urania , the daughter of her priest . Amyntas , conceiving it impossible to bestow this required dowry , has lost his wits . The wavering nymph is Laurinda . Eventually the divine riddle is happily solved .</p>
    <p n="221">There is no record of the revival for which Mrs. Behn wrote these two songs , but the play was undoubtedly put on at the Duke 's house . It was probably acted in 1682-3 , when a large number of the older plays were staged , especially such as gave scope for scenic effects and the introduction of musical interludes . In the spring of 1703 , Amyntas , reduced to three acts as The Fickle Shepherdess , was produced at Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Mrs. Bracegirdle acted Amyntas , and Mrs. Barry , Clorinda ( Laurinda ) .</p>
    <p n="222">p. 178 The Disappointment . This poem , which was extremely popular , was sent by Mrs. Behn to John Hoyle , her friend , with a letter in which she anxiously urges him to give the lie to various scandals of a grave nature that were current concerning his private life . The letter and the poem are both to be found in the various editions of Familiar Letters of Love , Gallantry , &amp; c. This poem was also printed in Poems on Several Occasions by the Rt . Hon . the Earl of R —— Antwerpen . [ London . ] 1680 (? ) And in Poems on Several Occasion by the R. H. the E. of R. London . ( 1712 ) . Under the title The Insensible it is to be found in the following editions of Rochester , 1718 ; 1731 ; 1739 ( in which year there were two several and slightly divergent editions ) ; 1752 ; 1800 (? ) ; and in a selected reprint circa 1884 . In these editions which contain The Insensible , The Disappointment is the title given to a different poem seemingly based on Ovid , Amorum , iii , vii . The whole subject has frequently been treated by poets and amorists of all time . Also cf . supra note on a Juniper-Tree .</p>
    <p n="223">Mr. G. Thorn Drury has drawn my attention to the fact that the original of Mrs. Behn 's The Disappointment , entitled Sur une Impuissance is to be found in Recueil de Diverses Poesies Choisies Non encore Imprimees .

    <p n="228">p. 188 To Pesibles Tune . James Paisible , flautist and composer , who set this charming song to music , was born about 1656 . He came to England circa 1680 , and soon found patrons , the chief of whom was the Duchess de Mazarin , who , with the help of St. Evremond , continually gave exquisite but elaborate concerts at Paradise Row , Chelsea . In a little drawing-room scena Paisible is actually mentioned by name . He is said to have won great favour owing to his easy manners and fluent wit . 4 December , 1686 , he procured a licence for his marriage with one Mary Davis . About 1691 he began to supply overtures and musical interludes for the theatres , and from 1703 to 1714 he set the tunes to Isaac 's dances performed at court on birthdays and other gala occasions . He lived in the parish of S. Martin'shYpppHeNinhYpppHeNthehYpppHeNFields , and died August , 1721 . Much of his work has been published and some yet remain in MS. His are the overture and interludes to Southerne 's Oroonoko .</p>
    <p n="229">p. 189 Set by Captain Pack . Captain Pack was an exceedingly popular and prolific musician of the day . The British Museum possesses four songs of his in one volume ( MS .) . Some of his compositions may be found in Playford 's Choice Ayres ( 1675 ) ; in The Theatre of Music ( 1685-7 ) ; in The Banquet ( 1688 ) . Amongst other pieces he composed incidental music for D'Urfey ' s Don Quixote , I and II ( 1694 ) , both the first two parts of which play were received with great applause .</p>
    <p n="230">p. 191 Set by Mr. Farmer . Thomas Farmer , Mus . Bac ., was originally one of the Waits of London . He graduated at Cambridge in 1684 . He composed much instrumental music for the theatre , and contributed some songs to the second edition of Playford 's Choice Ayres ( 1675 ) , to The Theatre of Music ( 1685-7 ) , and to D'Urfey ' s Third Collection of Songs ( 1685 ) . His is the music to Lee 's drama The Princess of Cleve ( 1682 ) , and various other compositions , including A Consort of Musick ( 1686 ) , of which work a second part followed a year or two after , bear his name . As Purcell composed an elegy , the words by Nahum Tate , for his funeral , Farmer must have died before 1695 .</p>

Peacock , created by the low comedian Angel , is a silly fribbling fop .</p>
    <p n="237">When the play was printed commendatory verses were prefixed by Ravenscroft and Mrs. Behn , both of whom adopted Pindarics ; by J. T .; and by Sam Clyat .</p>
    <p n="238">In Mrs. Behn 's Miscellany of 1685 is included ‘ A Pindaric by the Honourable Edward Howard to Mrs. B. Occasioned by a Copy she made on his Play , called the New Eutopia ’ . The piece is fluent and not ungraceful , concluding with a pretty compliment .</p>
    <p n="239">Mrs. Behn 's Pindarick is reprinted in the Muses Mercury , October , 1707 , with this note : ‘ The following Paper of Verses was written by Mrs. Behn , to a Poet , who being damn 'd , declar 'd he wou 'd write no more : However out of Affection to his Brother Poets , he left Rules for them to write ; which she seems to judge kinder of than they deserve ; since both the Rules and the Critick are already entirely forgot . The Reader will perceive that Mrs. Behn had no Notion of a Pindarick Poem , any farther than it consisted of irregular Numbers , and sav 'd the Writer the Trouble of even Measure ; which indeed is all our common Pindarick Poets know of the Matter . ’</p>
    <p n="240">Shee who late made the Amazons so Great refers to Howard 's tragicomedy , The Women 's Conquest ( 4to 1671 ) , the scene of which lies in Scythia , where we meet with several pseudo-classical Amazons .</p>

Southerne 's The Wives Excuse ; or , Cuckolds make Themselves ( 1692 ) , Act i , i : ‘ the outward Room to the Musick-Meeting , ’ which gives a very lively picture of these fashionable assemblies . An Italian and then an English song — ( ‘ which wo n't oblige a Man to tell you he has seen an Opera at Venice to understand ’ ) — are sung .</p>
    <p n="243">p. 210 Song . This song , with six additional verses ( certainly not the work of Mrs. Behn ) , is found in a broadside , which version is given in Vol . IV . of the Roxburghe Ballads ( pp . 656-9 ) , issued by the Ballad Society . In a similar way the song ‘ Ah Jenny gen your Eyes do kill ’ , sung in the City Heiress ( vide Vol . II , p. 253 ) , was in another broadside amplified to no less than eighty lines , and dubbed ‘ The Loves of Jockey and Jenny ’ . Ebsworth in his note on this song ( Roxburghe Ballads , VI , pp . 176-80 ) refers to Mrs. Behn and says : ‘ it is less her handiwork than that of her friend Tom D'Urfey , who considered himself facile princeps in the writing of Anglo-Scotch ditties ’ . Similar treatment was accorded the ‘ Song made by a Gentlemen ’ in Sir Patient Fancy , iii , i ( Vol . IV , p. 44 ) . For the ballad writer 's additions to this vide Roxburghe Ballads , VI ( 46-9 ) . It is noticeable that these four stanzas ( ‘ Young Jemmy was a Lad ’ ) under the title Jemmey appear in Female Poems on Several Occasions . ‘ Written by Ephelia . The Second Edition , with large Additions ’ ( 1682 ) . They are not in the first edition ( 1679 ) of these Poems . Jemmy is , of course , Monmouth , and in the line ‘ But oh he dances with a Grace ’ we have an allusion to his skill in dancing . Evelyn speaks of him as ‘ an excellent dancer ’ .</p>
    <p n="244">p. 211 Nickey Nackeys . This song is sung in The Roundheads ( vide Vol . I , p. 397 ) . Nickey Nackey is the name which the old senator Antonio ( a satire on Shaftesbury ) gives to the Greek courtezan Aquilina , Venice Preserv 'd , iii , i .

John Drummond , first Earl and titular Duke of Melford ( 1649-1714 ) was the second son of James , third Earl of Perth . He filled various posts of importance in Scotland , for which country he was in 1684 appointed Secretary of State . Converted to Catholicism , with his brother ( Lady Anne Gordon , their mother , had been a staunch Catholic ) , the two are said practically to have ruled Scotland for three years ’ space . A firm follower of James II , he accompanied him to exile and supported all his measures . During this period he was busy with many intrigues , and was attainted in 1695 .

A . 1674 . He was much esteemed in his native town of Worcester ( where he practised as a doctor ) as ‘ a man of wit and a jolly companion . ’ Several poems of his appear in The Grove , or a Collection of Original Poems ( 1721 ) , before which date , however , he was dead . The preface to this book highly praises him , and he appears to have been on terms of intimacy with the great Purcell as well as with Mrs. Behn . Dr. Kenrick is stated ‘ to have taken his degrees both in divinity and physic , and being a person of vivacity and wit , entertain 'd his leisure hours in poetical compositions . ’ He may be identical with Daniel Kenrick , D.

    <p n="261">p. 343 On the Honourable Sir Francis Fane . Sir Francis Fane ( died 1690 ? ) was the eldest son of Sir Francis Fane , K. B ., F. R. S ., of Fulbeck , Lincolnshire , and Aston , Yorkshire . He was created a K. B . at the coronation of Charles II . During the latter part of his life he retired to his country estate at Henbury , Glos ., where he died . His will is dated 14 November , 1689 , and was proved 15 September , 1691 . He is the author of a comedy , a masque , and a tragedy . Love in the Dark ; or The Man of Business ( 4to , 1675 ) , was produced at the Theatre Royal with Lacy , Jo Haines , Mohun , Kynaston and Mrs. Boutel in the cast . The scene is laid at Venice in Carnival time , and Intrigo , a good character , was not forgotten by Mrs. Centlivre when she composed The Busy Body . The Masque was written at Rochester 's request for his alteration of Valentinian . It may be found in Tate 's Poems by Several Hands ( 8vo , 1685 ) . The Sacrifice ( 4to , 1689 ) , was never acted , and would hardly have succeeded on the stage . The scene lies in ‘ a Revolted Fort in China ’ . It concludes with numerous deaths including that of Tamerlane the Great . Irene is his daughter belov 'd by Axalla ‘ General to Tamerlane ’ . Despina is the wife of the Emperor Bajazet . Ragalzan is pithily designated a Villain , and he well merits the description . There is a copy of prefatory verses ‘ To The Author ’ by Nahum Tate , but neither prologue nor epilogue . Fane 's plays are not without merit , but yet do not occupy a noteworthy rank in our theatrical library .</p>
    <p n="262">p. 348 To Alexis in Answer . This poem was written in answer to a copy of verses ( which in Lycidus , 1688 , immediately precede it ) , entitled ‘ A Poem against fruition — written on the reading in Mountains Essay : By Alexis ’ .</p>
    <p n="263">p. 350 A Pastoral Pindarick . On the Marriage of the Right Hon . the Earle of Dorset and Middlesex to the Lady Mary Compton . Charles Sackville , Lord Buckhurst , sixth Earl of Dorset and Earl of Middlesex ( 1638-1706 ) , wit , courtier , poet , debauchee , married his second wife Mary , daughter of James Compton , third Earl of Northampton , in 1685 . Lady Mary Compton , who became lady of the bedchamber to Queen Mary II , was celebrated for her beauty and understanding . She died 6 August 1691 . Walpole says of Sackville that he was the finest gentleman of the voluptuous court of Charles II . It has been well observed that after 1668 we hear little of his debaucheries , much of his munificence to and patronage of men of letters .</p>

    <p n="265">p. 360 To Amintas . To Amintas , upon reading the Lives of some of the Romans . The Muses Mercury reprints this poem , April , 1707 , as ‘ To Mr. H —— le , being belov 'd by both Sexes . Upon Reading the Lives of the Romans . By Mrs. A. Behn . ’ In the British Museum copy of this number an old hand has supplied the omitted letters ‘ oy ’ and we have Mr. Hoyle .</p>
    <p n="266">p. 361 On the first discovery . This poem appeared in the Muses Mercury , March , 1707 , with the following note : ‘ If it were proper to make publick what we have learnt of the Story of the Author of the following Verses , ‘ twould be an unquestionable Proof of their being genuine . For they are all Writ with her own Hand in a Person 's Book who was very much her Friend ; and from thence are now transcrib 'd for the Mercury . There are Fifteen or Sixteen Copies of Verse more , which will in due time be printed in this Collection . There 's no Man who knows any thing of Mrs. Behn 's way of Writing , but will presently see , that this Poem was written by her Self ; and the rest are of the same Character . ’ The Muses Mercury , as a fact , gave eleven other poems beside the present verses . Eight of these had already been printed : On the first discovery of falseness in Amintas ( p. 361 ) appears March , 1707 , as The Disoblig 'd Love . To Amintas ( p. 360 ) appears April , 1707 , as To Mr. H —— le , being belov 'd by both Sexes . Upon reading the Lives of the Romans . The Dream ( p. 183 ) appears May , 1707 , as Cupid in Chains . Of The Return ( p. 173 ) the first two stanzas appear August , 1707 , as ‘ To J. Hoyle , Esq . ’ Song ( When Jemmy first ) ( p. 165 ) appears September , 1707 , as On Capt . —— going to the War in Flanders . To the Honourable Edward Howard ( p. 204 ) appears October , 1707 , as To the Author of a new Eutopia , A Pindarick . The Willing Mistriss ( p. 163 ) appears December , 1707 , as A Song for J. H. Mr. E. B. and Mrs. F. M. ( p. 159 ) appears January , 1708 , as The Loves of Mirtillo and Phillis . From their notice and the reprinting of so many pieces it would seem that the editors of the Muses Mercury were not very well acquainted with Mrs. Behn 's published Poems .</p>
    <p n="267">p. 364 Westminster Drollery . This song has been here included from Westminster Drollery ( 1671 ) , on the authority of Ebsworth . It cannot , however , originally be Mrs. Behn 's since it appears in a fuller form as To his Whore who askt money of him ( Wit and Drollery , 1656 ) . There are other variants . It will be remembered that in The Rover , II , v , 1 ( Vol . I , p. 195 ) , Willmore jestingly sings the fifth verse to La Nuche .</p>

Sir William Clifton died unmarried , leaving two sisters , coheirs .</p>
    <p n="270">p. 368 On the Death of the late Earl of Rochester . John Wilmot , second Earl of Rochester , libertine , poet , wit , died from a complication of ailments due to his profligacies on 26 July , 1680 , at the High Lodge , Woodstock Park , whither he had journeyed in the preceding April . During the last three months of his life he shewed signs of a sincere penitence . He was much comforted by the ministrations of his chaplain , Robert Parsons , and on 25 June he wrote to Gilbert Burnet to come and receive his death-bed repentance . Burnet arrived 20 July , and stayed four days , spending the time in consolatory exhortations and prayer . Parsons ’ funeral sermon giving an account of Rochester 's death and penitence is well known , but Burnet 's book , Some Passages of the Life and Death of John , Earl of Rochester ( 1680 , 8vo ) , has been even more constantly re-issued . The Earl was buried in the north aisle of Spelsbury church , Oxfordshire , but without any inscription or monument to mark the grave .</p>

    <p n="273">Palsgrave , Lesclarcissement de la Langue Francoyse , has : ‘ Cypres for a woman 's necke — crespe ’ ; and Cotgrave , Fr . Dict ., ‘ Crespe : m. Cipres ; also Cobweb Lawne ’ . The etymology of the word has given rise to much discussion . Skinner , Etymol . Angl ., regards it as a corruption of the French crepes , but suggests that it may be derived from the island of Cyprus where it was first manufactured . This is almost certainly the case , cf . arras ; cashmere ; dimity ; dornick ; muslin , and many more . Wheatley in his notes on Every Man in His Humour suggests that Cyprus is derived from ‘ the plant Cyperus textilis , which is still used for the making of ropes and matting . ’ One of the English names of this plant was ‘ cypress ’ . Gerarde in his Herbal ( 1597 ) says : ‘ Cyperus longus is called ... in English , Cypresse and Galingale . ’ Mr. Wheatley 's suggestion is ingenious but impossible . There is , moreover , ample evidence in favour of the derivation from the isle Cyprus .</p>
    <p n="274">p. 372 A Paraphrase on the Lord 's Prayer . One may compare with this Paraphrase of the Pater by Mrs. Behn that by Poliziano —# Proseuche pros ton Theon #— written in 1472 when the poet was eighteen years old . Waller has sixteen lines OF the Paraphrase on the Lord 's Prayer , written by Mrs. Wharton . cf . also Some Reflections of his upon the Several Petitions in the Same Prayer .</p>

    <p n="276">p. 379 On the Author of that Excellent Book . The Way to Health , Long Life and Happiness was published ( 4to , 1682 ) , as Health 's Grand Preservative ; or , the Women 's Best Doctor ... shewing the Ill-Consequences of drinking Distilled Spirits and smoking Tobacco ... with a Rational Discourse on the excellency of Herbs ( 2nd edition , 1691 , 8vo , under the first-named title ; 3rd edition 1697 ) . It is the work of Thomas Tryon ( 1634-1703 ) , ‘ Pythagorean ’ , mystic , economist . This remarkable man , of whom a full account may be found in the Dic . Nat . Biog ., was long a fervent follower of Jacob Behmen , and forms an interesting link between this enthusiast and the early quakers . In The Way to Health he advocates a vegetable diet , complete abstinence from alcohol , tobacco , and indeed all luxuries . This , however , is done without fanaticism , and he has many pages of sound common sense . The manual is in the highest degree interesting , and in spite of much quaint detail his hygiene was excellent . Tryon died at Hackney , 21 August , 1703 . This same poem appears prefixed to The Way to make All People Rich : or Wisdom 's Call to Temperance and Frugality , by Philotheos Physiologus . [ T. Tryon ] . 12mo , 1685 .</p>
    <p n="277">p. 382 Epilogue to the Jealous Lovers . The Jealous Lovers , which is by many considered Randolph 's best play , was originally acted before the King and Queen at Cambridge by the students of Trinity . It was printed quarto , 1632 , with nine copies of English , and seven of Latin , verses . The revival of this comedy at the Duke 's house in 1682 met with extraordinary success , and is mentioned by Langbaine . Nokes , who spoke this epilogue , acted Asotus the prodigal , and Leigh , Ballio the pimp . Jo and Jack are Joseph Williams and John Bowman who sustained Tyndarus and Pamphilus .</p>
    <p n="278">Rebell Ward is a sharp hit at Sir Patience Ward ( 1629-1696 ) , the ultra-protestant lord mayor of London , to which office he was elected on Michaelmas day , 1680 , entering on to his duties 29 October following . He was a violent upholder of the city against the court , and in 1683 was tried for perjury in connection with the action brought by the Duke of York against Sir Thomas Pilkington for scandalum magnatum . On being found guilty he escaped to Holland but returned at the Revolution . He died 10 July , 1696 , and is buried in the chancel of St. Mary Abchurch . This fanatic incurred much odium early in his Mayoralty by having an additional inscription engraved on the Monument to the effect that the Great Fire had been caused by the Catholics . A similar inscription was placed on the house in Pudding Lane where the fire began . Tom Ward ( 1652-1791 ) , in his England 's Reformation ( 1710 , canto iv , p. 100 ) , jeering at Titus Oates and his fictions has the following lines :—</p>
    <p n="279">That sniffling whig-mayor , Patience Ward , To this damn 'd lie had such regard , That he his godly masons sent T'engrave it round the Monument . They did so ; but let such things pass : His men were fools , and he an ass .</p>

John Stafford , the translator of the Camilla episode ( Dryden 's Sylvae : or , the Second Part of Poetical Miscellanies , 1685 , p. 481 ) , is the same person who translated other parts of Virgil and Horace in the same Miscellany , Vols . I and II . In the 3rd edition of Vol . II he is called ‘ the Honourable Mr. John Stafford . ’ Stafford is also the author of the Epilogue ( sometimes erroneously printed as Dryden 's ) to Southerne 's The Disappointment ; or , The Mother in Fashion ( 1684 , and 4to , 1684 ) .</p>

    <p n="285">p. 390 Gildon 's Chorus Poetarum . ‘ Adequately to translate Sappho ’ says J . A. Symonds in The Greek Poets ‘ was beyond the power of even Catullus : that love-ode , which Longinus called “ not one passion , but a congress of passions , ” and which a Greek physician copied into his book of diagnoses as a compendium of all the symptoms of corroding emotion , appears but languid in its Latin dress of “ Ille mi par . ” Far less has any modern poet succeeded in the task : Rossetti , who deals so skilfully with Dante and Villon , is comparatively tame when he approaches Sappho . ’ This rendering of The Ode to Anactoria ( as tradition names it ) # Phainetai moi kenos isos theoisin #, first appears under Mrs. Behn 's name in Gildon 's Chorus Poetarum , 1694 . In State Poems , Vol . II ( 1703 ) , it is printed with the title On Madam Behn , a very different matter . If the lines are Mrs. Behn 's she must have versified them from a translation given her by Hoyle or some other friend . In any case they are graceful and far better than the versions of Ambrose Philips ( 1711 ) , or Smollett ( 1748 ) . But , indeed , it is impossible to translate these lines which are so truly ‘ mixed with fire ’ as Plutarch has it . For various attempts and a literal prose version see Wharton 's Sappho .</p>
    <p n="286">p. 391 Complaint of the poor Cavaliers . The Muses Mercury , June 1707 , prefixes the following to this poem : ‘ All the World knows Mrs. Behn was no Whig , no Republican , nor Fanatick ; her Zeal lay quite on the other Side : And tho her Manners was no Honour to any , yet her Wit made her acceptable to that which she espous 'd . She was a Politician , as well as a Poet : for we find in the short Account of her Life , printed with those of other Poets , she was employ 'd by Charles II . in the Discovery of the Dutch Intrigues in the Dutch War ; which she was the better qualifi 'd to do by her knowledge of their Language , she having liv 'd a long time in Surinam , a Colony where there were many Dutch Merchants ; and not long after she left it ‘ twas surrendered to that Republic by King Charles . ‘ Tis well known , that the Gentlemen she speaks of in the following Poem , had too much reason to complain ; and that the very Men , who had been so much instrumental in keeping King Charles the II . out of his Dominions , were most caress 'd after his Restoration . ’</p>

John FitzGerald , 18th Earl of Kildare , lived in St. James ’ Square , and in 1648 married , as his second wife , Elizabeth , eldest daughter of Charles Jones , 1st Earl of Ranelagh ( ‘ a fortune of L10 , 000 . ’ ) She died in 1758 at the great age of ninety-three . She was extremely beautiful , and either she or one of her unmarried sisters was a mistress of the King .</p>
    <p n="289">The Lady Mary Howard , sister to the Earl of Carlisle , died in the last week of October , 1694 . She was notorious for her intrigues , and the satires of the time accuse her of being little better than a procuress both for King Charles II and the Earl of Dorset . cf . Rochester 's The Royal Angler</p>

    <p n="301">p. 399 Green-Ribbon-Brother . The green ribbon was the badge of Shaftesbury 's party , as a red ribbon was of the Tories . North ( Examen ) gives the following account of the green ribbon fraternity : ‘ This was the club originally called the King 's Head Club . The gentlemen of that worthy society held their evening sessions continually at the King 's Head Tavern , over against the Inner Temple Gate . But upon occasion of the signal of a green ribbon agreed to be worn in their hats , in the days of street-engagements , like the coats of arms of valiant knights of old , whereby all the warriors of that society might be distinguished , and not mistake friends for enemies ; they were called also the Green Ribbon Club . Their seat was in a sort of car-four at Chancery-lane-end ; a centre of business and company most proper for such anglers of fools . The house was double balconied in the front , as may be yet seen , for the clubsters to issue forth in fresco , with hats and no perruques ; pipes in their mouths , merry faces , and diluted throats , for the vocal encouragement of the canaglia below , at bonfires , on usual and unusual occasions . ’ The Green Ribbon is frequently alluded to . cf . Otway , The Poet 's Complaint of His Muse ( 4to , 1680 ) , xv :—</p>
    <p n="302">He gain 'd authority and place : By many for preferments was thought fit , For talking treason without fear or wit : For opening failings in the state : } For loving noisy and unsound debate , } And wearing of a mystical green ribband in his hat . }</p>
    <p n="303">p. 400 Mrs. Behn 's Satyr on Dryden . This acrid attack upon the great laureate is ungenerous to a degree , and Mrs. Behn 's jibes are the more surprising , inasmuch as she had always been Tory to the backbone and a particular partisan of King James II . No doubt continued ill health and a hard struggle are largely responsible for her bad temper . There can be no question that Dryden 's conversion was absolutely conscientious , and his line of action at the Revolution amply proves his sincerity . Few , if any , critics would to-day venture to echo Macaulay 's discredited pronouncements , doubly dangerous that they are from the vigour and charm of their expression . Burnet 's partisan libels and denunciation of Dryden can be dismissed as impertinent and groundless . It is not to be supposed that on such an occasion the whole horde of waspish Lilliputians , who hated the genius of glorious John , would not pour forth a very torrent of venom and slime . Such impotent pasquils as The Renegado Poet , and To Mr. Dryden upon his declaring himself a Roman Catholic abound . Dryden , so far as we know , had always shown himself kindly to Mrs. Behn . He included her paraphrase of Ovid 's OEnone to Paris in the translation of Ovid 's Epistles ‘ by several Hands ’ ( 1680 ) , and took care to pay her a graceful compliment in the preface . Further , he allowed a prologue of his own to be used at the production of her posthumous play , The Widow Ranter , in 1690 . His letter of advice to Corinna ( Mrs. Thomas ) , which , with an acknowledgement of the freedom of some of his own scenes , bids her refrain from following the carelessness of the illustrious Astrea , was written with reference to the mitigated taste of the last years of the seventeenth century when Collier had already penned his diatribe of decorum , rather than as a rebuke of , or a reflection upon Mrs. Behn .</p>
    <p n="304">I owe the present copy of this satire , which has never before been printed , to the kindness of G. Thorn Drury , Esq ., K. C ., who generously transcribed the lines , thirty-one in number , from a MS. in his possession , which he copied from Haslewood , who writes ‘ From an old MS. in my Port Folio ’ .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>The Historical MSS . Commission Third Report ( 1872 ) Appendix gives amongst the MSS . in the custody of the Bishop of Southwark , On Mr. Dryden renegate , by Mrs. Behn , 1 leaf , 33 lines . Fr . Cunningham , the Southwark archivist , whom I take this opportunity of most heartily thanking for the trouble he was put to in the matter , finds that this leaf was one of a number of MSS . restored by Bishop Danell in October , 1875 , to the two sources whence they had been borrowed by the Rev . Mark Tierney . These were the Archivium of the late Cardinal Manning , and the Stonyhurst collection . Fr . Cyril Martindale , S. J ., informs me that the poem is not to be found at Stonyhurst College . Nor can it be traced at Westminster . The unfortunate conclusion is that it has been irretrievably lost . A couplet would appear to have dropped out in the present copy .</p>
    <p n="305"><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>In line twenty-four the MS. has ‘ constant to worship ’ , but as Mr. Thorn Drury pertinently points out , ‘ content ’ is clearly the right word .</p>
    <p n="306">p. 401 Valentinian . For Rochester 's Valentinian see Vol . III , The Lucky Chance , Preface ( p. 186 ) , and note on that passage ( p. 484 ) . This alteration was printed quarto , 1685 , with a vigorous defence of Rochester , ‘ a Preface concerning the Author and his Writings . By one of his Friends . ’ ( i. e . Robert Wolseley , son of Sir Charles Wolseley . ) It is curious to note that two publishers divided the risk of publication , and on the title pages of different 4tos we have different names . Mrs. Sarah Cook , who spoke this Prologue the first day , was an actress of no little eminence and beauty . Her origin was humble ( her mother is said to have kept a tiny shop ) , and she early joined the Nursery . In 1677 we find her cast for Gillian , when Leanard 's wholesale plagiarism of Brewer 's Country Girl entitled Country Innocence ; or , The Chambermaid turn 'd Quaker , was produced during Lent by the younger part of the Theatre Royal Company , with help from such experienced performers as Haynes , Lydal , Goodman , Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Knipp . The following year Mrs. Cook acted Flora in The Rambling Justice , another Nursery play , also put on in Lent . Langbaine ascribes this comedy to Leanard , and much of it is stolen in his style . Amongst Mrs. Cook 's many roles after she had joined the King 's Company as a regular actress were :— 1681 , Livia , in D'Urfey ' s Sir Barnaby Whig ; 1682 , Semanthe , in Southerne 's The Loyal Brother ; The Countess of Rutland in Banks ’ The Unhappy Favourite . After the Union of the Companies ( first performance 16 November , 1682 ) , Mrs. Cook , who had already taken a high place , acted parts of great importance . We find that she spoke the Epilogue to Dryden and Lee 's The Duke of Guise ( December , 1682 ) , and in 1683 she appears as Spaconia in a notable revival of A King and No King . The same year she possibly acted the Countess in Ravenscroft 's Dame Dobson . In 1684 she played Serena in Lee 's Constantine the Great ; Erminia in Southerne 's The Disappointment ; Portia , in a revival of Julius Caesar ; 1685 , Aminta in D'Urfey ' s The Commonwealth of Women ; Edith , in a revival of Rollo , Duke of Normandy ; 1686 , Lady Lovemore in Jevon 's farce , A Devil of A Wife ; Donna Elvira in D'Urfey ' s The Banditti ; 1687 , Letitia in Mrs. Behn 's The Lucky Chance ; Quisara in Tate 's poor alteration of The Island Princess ; Elaria , in Mrs. Behn 's farcical The Emperor of the Moon . Genest who records this as her last role says that she quitted the stage at this time . It has been stated that she died in the winter of 1687 . At any rate her name no longer appears , and her place was amply filled by the advent of Mrs. Bracegirdle . Mrs. Cook was celebrated for speaking saucy and political epilogues , e. g . that to The Duke of Guise , and , again , Dryden 's brilliant epilogue to Constantine the Great . A MS. ( Harleian ) Satire on the Players ( c. 1682-3 ) coarsely vilipends her thus :—</p>
    <p n="307">Impudent Sarah thinks she 's praised by all , Mistaken Drab , back to thy Mother 's stall , And let true Savin whom thou hast proved so well ; } ‘ Tis a rare thing that belly will not swell , } Though swived and swived and as debauched as hell . }</p>
    <p n="308">On the Second Day of Valentinian a second prologue was spoken by Mrs. Cook . They are clever verses , and with regard to the critics who gird at Rochester , some ‘ for his want of Wit ’ , and others because ‘ he too obscenely writ ’ , it is said :—</p>
    <p n="309">Like Falstaffe let ‘ em conquer Heroes dead , And praise Greek Poets they cou 'd never read .</p>
    <p n="310">The third ‘ Prologue intended for Valentinian , to be spoken by Mrs. Barrey ’ contains the famous lines with reference to the dead author :—</p>
    <p n="311">Some Beauties here I see — Though now demure , have felt his pow'rful Charms , And languish 'd in the circle of his Arms .</p>
    <p n="312">p. 402 Jenny . A well-known orange wench to whom there are allusions in the satires of the day . ‘ Jenny ’ is sometimes also a generic name for a mask .</p>
    <p n="313">p. 402 Blanket Fair . Evelyn , 6 January , 1684 , notes ‘ the river quite frozen ’ , and on the 9th writes : ‘ I went across the Thames on the ice , now become so thick as to bear not only streets of booths , in which they roasted meat , and had divers shops of wares , quite across as in a town , but coaches , carts and horses passed over . ’ On subsequent days he notes the continuance of this frost , and on 24 January has a famous description of the Thames fair with its ‘ sleds , sliding with skates , a bull-baiting , horse and coach-races , puppet-plays and interludes , cooks , tippling , and other lewd places , so that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph , or carnival on the water ’ . A printing press was even set up and cards printed , one of which is given , dated 5 February , in a note by Bray , Evelyn 's Diary , II ( p. 192 ) ( 1850 ) .</p>
    <p n="314">p. 403 To Henry Higden . Henry Higden , to whose translation of Juvenal 's tenth satire Mrs. Behn prefixed these complimentary verses , was a well-known wit of the day . A Yorkshireman , a member of the Middle Temple , he moved in the best and gayest society . In 1686 he published A Modern Essay on the Thirteenth Satyr of Juvenal ( Licensed 11 November , 1685 ) , and in 1687 followed this up by A Modern Essay on the Tenth Satyr of Juvenal . With Mrs. Behn 's Poem are also printed verses by Dryden and Settle . Higden is the author of a good comedy , The Wary Widdow : or , Sir Noisy Parrat ( 4to , 1693 ) . Sir Charles Sedley wrote the prologue , there are six copies ( one by Tom Brown in Latin ) , of complimentary verses , and the play is dedicated to the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex . A legend exists that the author ‘ had introduced so much punch-drinking into it that the actors got intoxicated before the end of the third act , and the house separated in confusion ’ . This seems to me dubious at the least , and if true the actors must have begun in a singularly mellow condition . Sir Noisy , indeed ( Act i ) , declares ‘ we must banish Venus out of our Calender , Jolly Bacchus shall rejoyce our hearts , and be our Dominical Letter , ’ yet in Act ii , sc . iii , he toasts Clarinda 's health but once and that in ‘ Wine and Colour 'd water ’ ; whilst Act iii , sc . vi , ‘ the Rose Tavern ’ where Sir Noisy gets drunk with Scaredevil and Fulham is somewhat quiet for a toping of the period . In Act iv Nantz is quaffed on shipboard , but all the rest of the play is temperate enough , and the tradition ( repeated ad nauseam ) , must indubitably be dismissed as pure fiction . Higden in his Preface ascribes the doom of The Wary Widdow to those ‘ Sons of Zeruiah ’ , the ‘ murmuring Israelites ’ and ‘ Pagans of the Pits ’ who ‘ hissing , mimicking , ridiculing , and Cat-calling ’ utterly ‘ vanquished the stage ’ , and dumbfounded the unfortunate performers . No doubt a braying clique damned the piece . It may be noted that in his Preface Higden takes occasion to gird at the recent success of Congreve 's The Old Bachelor .</p>
    <p n="315">p. 405 On the Death of E. Waller , Esq . Edmund Waller died at Hall Barn , 21 October , 1687 , and on 26 October was buried in Beaconsfield churchyard . This elegy of Mrs. Behn 's was first printed in a collection entitled Poems to Memory of that Incomparable Poet Edmund Waller , Esquire . ‘ By Several Hands . ’ 1688 . The volume ( 27 pages ) , contains poems by Sir John Cotton , Bart . ; Sir Tho . Higgons ; T. Rymer ; Monsieur St. Evremon ( six lines in French , with an English translation by T. R .) ; George Granville ; Bevill Higgons ; A. Behn ; an Anonymous Poem ; and ‘ To Mr. Riley , Drawing Mr. Waller 's Picture ’ , signed T. R. The letter accompanying these lines sent by Mrs. Behn to Waller 's daughter-in-law , will be found in the Memoir ( Vol . I , pp . l-li ) .</p>
    <p n="316">p. 407 A Pindaric Poem . For the occasion of this Poem vide Vol . I , p. liii . From stanza 4 it would appear that Dr. Burnet had suggested to Mrs. Behn that she should write a Pindaric or some similar poem on William of Orange and his consort . To her credit she refused . The verses To Her Sacred Majesty Queen Mary are more than ample on such themes .</p>
