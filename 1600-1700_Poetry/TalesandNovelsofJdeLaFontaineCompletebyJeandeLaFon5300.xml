   <lg>
     <l n="2">Jean de La Fontaine was born on the 8th of July , 1621 , at</l>
     <l n="3">Chateau-Thierry , and his family held a respectable position there .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His education was neglected , but he had received that genius which makes amends for all . While still young the tedium of society led him into retirement , from which a taste for independence afterwards withdrew him .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He had reached the age of twenty-two , when a few sounds from the lyre of</l>
     <l n="2">Malherbe , heard by accident , awoke in him the muse which slept .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He soon became acquainted with the best models : Pheedrus , Virgil , Horace and Terence amongst the Latins ; Plutarch , Homer and Plato , amongst the Greeks ; Rabelais , Marot and d'Urfe , amongst the French ; Tasso , Ariosto and Boccaccio , amongst the Italians .</p>
   <p>He married , in compliance with the wishes of his family , a beautiful , witty and chaste woman , who drove him to despair .</p>
   <p>He was sought after and cherished by all distinguished men of letters . But it was two Ladies who kept him from experiencing the pangs of poverty .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine , if there remain anything of thee , and if it be permitted to thee for a moment to soar above all time ; see the names of La Sabliere and of Hervard pass with thine to the ages to come !</p>
   <p>The life of La Fontaine was , so to speak , only one of continual distraction . In the midst of society , he was absent from it . Regarded almost as an imbecile by the crowd , this clever author , this amiable man , only permitted himself to be seen at intervals and by friends .</p>
   <p>He had few books and few friends .</p>
   <p>Amongst a large number of works that he has left , everyone knows his fables and his tales , and the circumstances of his life are written in a hundred places .</p>
   <p>He died on the 16th of March , 1695 .</p>
   <p>Let us keep silence about his last moments , for fear of irritating those who never forgive .</p>
   <p>His fellow-citizens honour him in his posterity to this day .</p>
   <p>Long after his death , foreigners went to visit the room which he had occupied .</p>
   <p>Once a year , I shall go to visit his tomb .</p>
   <p>On that day , I shall tear up a fable of La Mothe , a tale of Vergier , or several of the best pages of Grecourt .</p>
   <p>He was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Joseph , by the side of Moliere .</p>
   <p>That spot will always be held sacred by poets and people of taste .</p>
   <p>THE AUTHOR 'S PREFACE</p>
   <p>TO THE FIRST VOLUME OF THESE TALES</p>
   <p>I had resolved not to consent to the printing of these Tales , until after I had joined to them those of Boccaccio , which are those most to my taste ; but several persons have advised me to produce at once what I have remaining of these trifles , in order to prevent from cooling the curiosity to see them , which is still in its first ardour . I gave way to this advice without much difficulty , and I have thought well to profit by the occasion . Not only is that permitted me , but it would be vanity on my part to despise such an advantage . It has sufficed me to wish that no one should be imposed upon in my favour , and to follow a road contrary to that of certain persons , who only make friends in order to gain voices in their favour by their means ; creatures of the Cabal , very different from that Spaniard who prided himself on being the son of his own works . Although I may still be as much in want of these artifices as any other person , I cannot bring myself to resolve to employ them ; however I shall accommodate myself if possible to the taste of the times , instructed as I am by my own experience , that there is nothing which is more necessary . Indeed one cannot say that all seasons are suitable for all classes of books . We have seen the Roundelays , the Metamorphoses , the Crambos , reign one after another . At present , these gallantries are out of date and nobody cares about them : so certain is it that what pleases at one time may not please at another ! It only belongs to works of truly solid merit and sovereign beauty , to be well received by all minds and in all ages , without possessing any other passport than the sole merit with which they are filled . As mine are so far distant from such a high degree of perfection , prudence advises that I should keep them in my cabinet unless I choose well my own time for producing them . This is what I have done , or what I have tried to do in this edition , in which I have only added new Tales , because it seemed to me that people were prepared to take pleasure in them . There are some which I have extended , and others which I have abridged , only for the sake of diversifying them and making them less tedious . But I am occupying myself over matters about which perhaps people will take no notice , whilst I have reason to apprehend much more important objections . There are only two principal ones which can be made against me ; the one that this book is licentious ; the other that it does not sufficiently spare the fair sex . With regard to the first , I say boldly that the nature of what is understood as a tale decided that it should be so , it being an indispensable law according to Horace , or rather according to reason and common sense , that one must conform one 's self to the nature of the things about which one writes . Now , that I should be permitted to write about these as so many others have done and with success I do not believe it can be doubted ; and people cannot condemn me for so doing , without also condemning Ariosto before me and the Ancients before Ariosto . It may be said that I should have done better to have suppressed certain details , or at least to have disguised them . Nothing was more easy , but it would have weakened the tale and taken away some of its charm : So much circumspection is only necessary in works which promise great discretion from the beginning , either by their subject or by the manner in which they are treated . I confess that it is necessary to keep within certain limits , and that the narrowest are the best ; also it must be allowed me that to be too scrupulous would spoil all . He who would wish to reduce Boccaccio to the same modesty as Virgil , would assuredly produce nothing worth having , and would sin against the laws of propriety by setting himself the task to observe them . For in order that one may not make a mistake in matters of verse and prose , extreme modesty and propriety are two very different things . Cicero makes the latter consist in saying what is appropriate one should say , considering the place , the time , and the persons to whom one is speaking . This principle once admitted , it is not a fault of judgment to entertain the people of to-day with Tales which are a little broad . Neither do I sin in that against morality . If there is anything in our writings which is capable of making an impression on the mind , it is by no means the gaiety of these Tales ; it passes off lightly ; I should rather fear a tranquil melancholy , into which the most chaste and modest novels are very capable of plunging us , and which is a great preparation for love . As to the second objection , by which people reproach me that this book does wrong to womankind , they would be right if I were speaking seriously : but who does not see that this is all in jest , and consequently cannot injure ? We must not be afraid on that account that marriages in the future will be less frequent , and husbands more on their guard . It may still be objected that these Tales are unfounded or that they have everywhere a foundation easy to destroy ; in short that they are absurdities and have not the least tinge of probability . I reply in a few words that I have my authorities : and besides it is neither truth nor probability which makes the beauty and the charm of these Tales : it is only the manner of telling them . These are the principal points on which I have thought it necessary to defend myself . I abandon the rest to the censors ; the more so as it would be an infinite undertaking to pretend to reply to all . Criticism never stops short nor ever wants for subjects on which to exercise itself : even if those I am able to foresee were taken from it , it would soon have discovered others .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IN Lombardy 's fair land , in days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="2">Once dwelt a prince , of youthful charms , a store ;</l>
     <l n="3">Each FAIR , with anxious look , his favours sought ,</l>
     <l n="4">And ev'ry heart within his net was caught .</l>
     <l n="5">Quite proud of beauteous form and smart address ,</l>
     <l n="6">In which the world was led to acquiesce ,</l>
     <l n="7">He cried one day , while ALL attention paid ,</l>
     <l n="8">I 'll bet a million , Nature never made</l>
     <l n="9">Beneath the sun , another man like me ,</l>
     <l n="10">Whose symmetry with mine can well agree .</l>
     <l n="11">If such exist , and here will come , I swear</l>
     <l n="12">I 'll show him ev'ry lib'ral princely care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">A noble Roman , who the challenge heard ,</l>
     <l n="14">This answer gave the king his soul preferr 'd</l>
     <l n="15">— Great prince , if you would see a handsome man ,</l>
     <l n="16">To have my brother here should be your plan ;</l>
     <l n="17">A frame more perfect Nature never gave ;</l>
     <l n="18">But this to prove , your courtly dames I crave ;</l>
     <l n="19">May judge the fact , when I 'm convinc 'd they 'll find :</l>
     <l n="20">Like you , the youth will please all womankind ;</l>
     <l n="21">And since so many sweets at once may cloy ,</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Twere well to have a partner in your joy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">THE king , surpris 'd , expressed a wish to view</l>
     <l n="24">This brother , form 'd by lines so very true ;</l>
     <l n="25">We 'll see , said he , if here his charms divine</l>
     <l n="26">Attract the heart of ev'ry nymph , like mine ;</l>
     <l n="27">And should success attend our am'rous lord ,</l>
     <l n="28">To you , my friend , full credit we 'll accord .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">AWAY the Roman flew , Joconde to get ,</l>
     <l n="30">( So nam 'd was he in whom these features met ;)</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Midst woods and lawns , retir 'd from city strife ,</l>
     <l n="32">And lately wedded to a beauteous wife ;</l>
     <l n="33">If bless 'd , I know not ; but with such a fair ,</l>
     <l n="34">On him must rest the folly to despair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">THE Roman courtier came , his business told</l>
     <l n="36">The brilliant offers from the monarch bold ;</l>
     <l n="37">His mission had success , but still the youth</l>
     <l n="38">Distraction felt , which ‘ gan to shake his truth ;</l>
     <l n="39">A pow'rful monarch 's favour there he view 'd ;</l>
     <l n="40">A partner here , with melting tears bedew 'd ;</l>
     <l n="41">And while he wavered on the painful choice ,</l>
     <l n="42">She thus address 'd her spouse with plaintive voice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="43">CAN you , Joconde , so truly cruel prove ,</l>
     <l n="44">To quit my fervent love in courts to move ?</l>
     <l n="45">The promises of kings are airy dreams ,</l>
     <l n="46">And scarcely last beyond the day 's extremes</l>
     <l n="47">By watchful , anxious care alone retain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="48">And lost , through mere caprice , as soon as gain 'd .</l>
     <l n="49">If weary of my charms , alas ! you feel ,</l>
     <l n="50">Still think , my love , what joys these woods conceal ;</l>
     <l n="51">Here dwell around tranquillity and ease ;</l>
     <l n="52">The streams ’ soft murmurs , and the balmy breeze ,</l>
     <l n="53">Invite to sleep ; these vales where breathe the doves ,</l>
     <l n="54">All , all , my dear Joconde , renew our loves ;</l>
     <l n="55">You laugh !— Ah ! cruel , go , expose thy charms ,</l>
     <l n="56">Grim death will quickly spare me these alarms !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">JOCONDE 'S reply our records ne'er relate ,</l>
     <l n="58">Nor what he did , nor how he left his mate ;</l>
     <l n="59">And since contemp'raries decline the task ;</l>
     <l n="60">‘ Twere folly , such details of me to ask .</l>
     <l n="61">We 're told , howe'er , when ready to depart ,</l>
     <l n="62">With flowing tears she press 'd him to her heart ;</l>
     <l n="63">And on his arm a brilliant bracelet plac 'd ,</l>
     <l n="64">With hair around her picture nicely trac 'd ;</l>
     <l n="65">This guard in full remembrance of my love ,</l>
     <l n="66">She cried ;— then clasped her hands to pow'rs above .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="67">TO see such dire distress , and poignant grief ,</l>
     <l n="68">Might lead to think , soon death would bring relief ;</l>
     <l n="69">But I , who know full well the female mind ,</l>
     <l n="70">At best oft doubt affliction of the kind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="71">JOCONDE set out at length ; but that same morn ;</l>
     <l n="72">As on he mov 'd , his soul with anguish torn ,</l>
     <l n="73">He found the picture he had quite forgot ,</l>
     <l n="74">Then turn 'd his steed , and back began to trot .</l>
     <l n="75">While musing what excuse to make his mate ,</l>
     <l n="76">At home he soon arriv 'd , and op 'd the gate ;</l>
     <l n="77">Alighted unobserv 'd , ran up the stairs ;</l>
     <l n="78">And ent'ring to the lady unawares ,</l>
     <l n="79">He found this darling rib , so full of charms ;</l>

     <l n="84">In this dilemma , clearly acted right ;</l>
     <l n="85">The less of such misfortunes said is best ;</l>

     <l n="87">Their lives , through pity , or prudential care ;</l>
     <l n="88">With much reluctance , he was led to spare ;</l>

     <l n="91">Had any smart gallant supplied my place ,</l>

     <l n="6">To whom they stated facts without disguise ;</l>

    <head>THE PEASANT AND HIS ANGRY LORD</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">ONCE on a time , as hist'ry ' s page relates ,</l>
     <l n="2">A lord , possessed of many large estates ,</l>
     <l n="3">Was angry with a poor and humble clod ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who tilled his grounds and feared his very nod .</l>
     <l n="5">Th ’ offence ( as often happens ) was but small ,</l>
     <l n="6">But on him , vowed the peer , his rage should fall —</l>
     <l n="7">Said he , a halter , rascal , you deserve ;</l>
     <l n="8">You 'll never from the gallows-turnpike swerve :</l>
     <l n="9">Or , soon or late you swinging will be found</l>
     <l n="10">Who , born for hanging , ever yet was drowned ?</l>
     <l n="11">Howe'er you 'll smile to hear my lenient voice ;</l>
     <l n="12">Observe , three punishments await your choice ;</l>
     <l n="13">Take which you will .— The first is , you shall eat ,</l>
     <l n="14">Of strongest garlick , thirty heads complete ;</l>
     <l n="15">No drink you 'll have between , nor sleep , nor rest ;</l>
     <l n="16">You know a breach of promise I detest .</l>
     <l n="17">Or , on your shoulders further I propose ,</l>
     <l n="18">To give you , with a cudgel , thirty blows .</l>
     <l n="19">Or , if more pleasing , that you truly pay ,</l>
     <l n="20">The sum of thirty pounds without delay .</l>

     <l n="21">THE peasant ‘ gan to turn things in his mind :—</l>

     <l n="23">No drink , you say , between ; that makes it worse ;</l>
     <l n="24">To eat the garlick thus , would prove a curse .</l>

     <l n="35">UPON a dish my lord the number told ;</l>
     <l n="36">Clod no way liked the garlick to behold .</l>
     <l n="37">With piteous mien the garlick head he took ,</l>
     <l n="38">Then on it num'rous ways was led to look ,</l>
     <l n="39">And grumbling much , began to spit and eat ,</l>

     <l n="41">To touch it with his tongue he durst not do ;</l>
     <l n="42">He knew not how to act or what pursue .</l>
     <l n="43">The peer , delighted at the man 's distress ,</l>
     <l n="44">The garlick made him bite , and chew , and press ,</l>
     <l n="45">Then gulp it down as if delicious fare ;</l>
     <l n="46">The first he passed ; the second made him swear ;</l>
     <l n="47">The third he found was every whit as sad ,</l>
     <l n="48">He wished the devil had it , ‘ twas so bad .</l>
     <l n="49">In short , when at the twelfth our wight arrived ,</l>
     <l n="50">He thought his mouth and throat of skin deprived .</l>

     <l n="53">In thy repasts dost love to wet thy jaws ?</l>
     <l n="54">Well ! well ! I wo n't object ; thou know'st my laws ;</l>

     <l n="56">Yet recollect , to drink , since you design ,</l>
     <l n="57">That afterward , my friend , you 'll have to choose</l>
     <l n="58">The thirty blows , or thirty pounds to lose .</l>

     <l n="62">Where can an humble lab'rer , like myself ,</l>
     <l n="63">Expect the sum of thirty pounds to seize ?</l>
     <l n="64">Then , said the peer , be cudgelled if you please ;</l>
     <l n="65">Take thirty thwacks ; for naught the garlick goes .</l>
     <l n="66">To moisten well his throat , and ease his woes ,</l>
     <l n="67">The peasant drank a copious draught of wine ,</l>
     <l n="68">And then to bear the cudgel would resign .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="69">A SINGLE blow he patiently endured ;</l>
     <l n="70">The second , howsoe'er , his patience cured ;</l>
     <l n="71">The third was more severe , and each was worse ;</l>
     <l n="72">The punishment he now began to curse ;</l>
     <l n="73">Two lusty wights , with cudgels thrashed his back</l>
     <l n="74">And regularly gave him thwack and thwack ;</l>
     <l n="75">He cried , he roared , for grace he begged his lord ,</l>
     <l n="76">Who marked each blow , and would no ease accord ;</l>
     <l n="77">But carefully observed , from time to time ,</l>
     <l n="78">That lenity he always thought sublime ;</l>
     <l n="79">His gravity preserved ; considered too</l>

     <l n="81">AT length , when Greg'ry twenty strokes had got ,</l>

     <l n="84">If you desire , my lord , that I should live .</l>
     <l n="85">Then down with thirty pounds , replied the peer ,</l>
     <l n="86">Since you the blows so much pretend to fear ;</l>
     <l n="87">I 'm sorry for you ; but if all the gold</l>
     <l n="88">Be not prepared , your godfather , I 'm told ,</l>

     <l n="29">THE AUTHOR 'S PREFACE</l>
     <l n="30">TO HIS SECOND BOOK OF THESE TALES</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>These are the last works of this style that will come from the pen of the Author , and consequently this is the last opportunity he has of vindicating the boldness and privilege which he has assumed . We make no mention of villainous rhymes , of lines that run into the next , of two vowels without elision , nor , in general , of such kinds of carelessness as he would not allow himself in another style of poetry , but which are part and parcel , so to say , of this style . Too anxious a care in avoiding such would force a tale-writer into a labyrinth of shifts , into narratives as dull as they are grand , into straits that are utterly useless , and would make him disregard the pleasure of the heart in order to labour for the gratification of the ear . We must leave studied narrative for lofty subjects , and not compose an epic poem of the Adventures of Renaud d'Ast . Suppose the Author , who has put these tales into rhyme , had brought to bear on them all the care and preciseness required of him ; not only would this care be observed , especially as it is unnecessary , but it would also transgress the precept lain down by Ouintilian , still the Author would not have attained the main object , which is to interest the reader , to charm him , to rivet his attention in spite of himself ,— in a word , to please him . As everybody knows , the secret of pleasing the reader is not always based on regulation , nor even on symmetry ; there is need of smartness and tastefulness , if we would strike home . How many of those perfect types of beauty do we see which never strike home , and of which nobody feels enamoured ! We do not wish to rob Modern Authors of the praise that is due to them . Nicely turned lines , fine language , accuracy , elegance of rhyme are accomplishments in a poet . However that may be , let us consider of our own epigrams wherein all these qualities are combined , perhaps we shall find in them far less point , nay , I would venture to add , far less charm than in those of Marot or Saint-Gelais , although almost all the works of the latter poets are full of the same faults as are attributed to us . We will be told that these were not faults in their day , whereas they are very great faults in ours . To this we answer by a similar kind of argument , by saying , as we have already said , that these would undoubtedly be faults in another style of poetry , but not in this . The late M. de Voiture is a proof in point . We need only read the works in which he brings to life again the character of Marot . For our Author does not lay claim to praise for himself , nor to rounds of applause from the public for having put a few tales into rhyme . Without doubt he has entered on quite a new path , and has pursued it to the utmost of his power , choosing now one road , now another , and always treading with surer step when he has followed the manner of our old poets “ quorum in hae re imitari negligentiam exoptat potius quam istorum diligentiam . ”</p>
   <p>But while saying that we wished to waive this question , we have unconsciously involved ourselves in its discussion . Perhaps this has not been without advantage ; for there is nothing that resembles faults more than these licenses . Let us now consider the liberty which the Author has assumed in cutting into the property of others as well as his own , without making exception even to the best known stories , none of which he scruples to tamper with . He curtails , enlarges , and alters incidents and details , at times the main issue and the sequel ; in short , the story is no longer the same ; it is , in point of fact , quite a new tale ; its original author would find it no small difficulty to recognise in it his own work . “ Non sic decet contaminari fabulas , ” Critics will say . Why should they not ? They twitted Terence in just the same way ; but Terence sneered at them , and claimed a right to treat the matter as he did . He has mingled his own ideas with the subjects he drew from Menander , just as Sophocles and Euripides mingled theirs with the subjects they drew from former writers , sparing neither history nor romance , where “ decorum ” and the rules of the Drama were at issue . Shall this privilege cease with respect to fictitious stories ? Must we in future have more scrupulous or religious regard , if we may be allowed the expression , for falsehood than the Ancients had for truth ? What people call a good tale never passes from hand to hand without receiving some fresh touch of embellishment . How comes it then , we may be asked , that in many passages the Author curtails instead of enlarging on the original ? On that point we are agreed : the Author does so in order to avoid lengthiness and ambiguity ,— two faults which are inadmissible in such matters , especially the latter . For if lucidity is to be commended in all literary works , we may say that it is especially necessary in narratives , where one thing is , as a rule , the sequel and the result of another ; where the less important sometimes lays the basis of the more important ; so that , once the thread becomes broken , the reader cannot gather it up again . Besides , as narratives in verse are very awkward , the author must clog himself with details as little as possible ; by means of this you relieve not only yourself , but also the reader , for whom an author should not fail to prepare pleasure unalloyed . Whenever the Author has altered a few particulars and even a few catastrophes , he has been forced to do so by the cause of that catastrophe and the urgency of giving it a happy termination . He has fancied that in tales of this kind everyone ought to be satisfied with the end : it pleases the reader at any rate , if the author has not given the characters too distasteful a rendering . But he must not go so far as that , if possible , nor make the reader laugh and cry in the same tale . This medley shocks Horace above all things ; his wish is not that our works should border on the grotesque , and that we should draw a picture half woman half fish . These are the general motives the Author has had in view . We might still quote special motives and vindicate each point ; but we must needs leave something to the capacity and leniency of our readers . They will be satisfied , then , with the motives we have mentioned . We would have stated them more clearly and have set more by them , had the general compass of a Preface so allowed .</p>

    <head>RICHARD MINUTOLO</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IN ev'ry age , at Naples , we are told ,</l>
     <l n="2">Intrigue and gallantry reign uncontrolled ;</l>
     <l n="3">With beauteous objects in abundance blessed .</l>
     <l n="4">No country round so many has possessed ;</l>
     <l n="5">Such fascinating charms the FAIR disclose ,</l>
     <l n="6">That irresistibly soft passion flows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">‘ MONG these a belle , enchanting to behold ,</l>
     <l n="8">Was loved by one , of birth and store of gold ;</l>
     <l n="9">Minutolo ( and Richard ) was his name ,</l>
     <l n="10">In Cupid 's train a youth of brilliant fame :</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Tween Rome and Paris none was more gallant ,</l>
     <l n="12">And num'rous hearts were for him known to pant .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">CATELLA ( thus was called our lady fair ,)</l>
     <l n="14">So long , howe'er , resisted Richard 's snare ,</l>
     <l n="15">That prayers , and vows , and promises were vain ;</l>
     <l n="16">A favour Minutolo could not gain .</l>
     <l n="17">At length , our hero weary , coldness showed ,</l>
     <l n="18">And dropt attendance , since no kindness flowed ;</l>
     <l n="19">Pretended to be cured :— another sought ,</l>
     <l n="20">And feigned her charms his tender heart had caught :</l>
     <l n="21">Catella laughed , but jealousy was nigh ;</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Twas for her friend that now He heaved the sigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">THESE dames together met , and Richard too ,</l>
     <l n="24">The gay gallant a glowing picture drew ,</l>
     <l n="25">Of certain husbands , lovers , prudes , and wives ;</l>
     <l n="26">Who led in secret most lascivious lives .</l>
     <l n="27">Though none he named , Catella was amazed ;</l>
     <l n="28">His hints suspicions of her husband raised ;</l>
     <l n="29">And such her agitation and affright ,</l>
     <l n="30">That , anxious to procure more certain light ,</l>
     <l n="31">In haste she took Minutolo aside ,</l>
     <l n="32">And begged the names he would not from her hide ,</l>
     <l n="33">With all particulars , from first to last :—</l>
     <l n="34">Her ardent wish to know whate'er had passed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">SO long your reign , said Richard , o'er my mind ,</l>
     <l n="36">Deny I could not , howsoe'er inclined ;</l>
     <l n="37">With Mrs. Simon often is your spouse ;</l>
     <l n="38">Her character no doubt your spleen will rouse ;</l>
     <l n="39">I 've no design , observe to give offence ,</l>
     <l n="40">But , when I see your int'rest in suspense ,</l>
     <l n="41">I cannot silent keep ; though , were I still</l>
     <l n="42">A slave , devoted wholly to your will ,</l>
     <l n="43">As late I moved , I would not drop a word</l>
     <l n="44">Mistrust of lovers may not be absurd ;</l>
     <l n="45">Besides , you 'd fancy other motives led</l>
     <l n="46">To tell you of your husband what was said ;</l>
     <l n="47">But heav'n be praised , of you I nothing want ;</l>
     <l n="48">My object 's plain — no more the fond gallant .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">I 'VE lately certain information had ,</l>
     <l n="50">Your spouse ( I scarcely thought the man so bad ,)</l>
     <l n="51">Has with the lady an appointment made ;</l>
     <l n="52">At Jack 's nice bagnio he will meet the jade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">NOW clearly Jack 's not rich , and there 's no doubt ;</l>
     <l n="54">A hundred ducats give , and — ALL will out ;</l>
     <l n="55">Let him but have a handsome sum in view ,</l>
     <l n="56">And any thing you wish , be sure he 'll do ;</l>
     <l n="57">You then can manage ev'ry way so well ,</l>
     <l n="58">That , at the place assigned to meet his belle ,</l>
     <l n="59">You 'll take this truant husband by surprise ;—</l>
     <l n="60">Permit me in this nice affair to advise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="61">THE lady has agreed , you will remark ,</l>
     <l n="62">That in a room where ev'ry part is dark ,</l>
     <l n="63">( Perhaps to ‘ scape the keeper 's prying sight ,</l>
     <l n="64">Or shame directs exclusion of the light ,)</l>
     <l n="65">She will receive your gay inconstant spouse ;</l>
     <l n="66">Now , take her place ; the case deceit allows ;</l>
     <l n="67">Make Jack your friend ; nor haggle at the price ;</l>
     <l n="68">A hundred ducats give , is my advice ;</l>
     <l n="69">He 'll place you in the room where darkness reigns ;</l>
     <l n="70">Think not too fast , nor suffer heavy chains ;</l>
     <l n="71">Do what you wish , and utter not a word ;</l>
     <l n="72">To speak , assuredly would be absurd ;</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Twould spoil the whole ; destroy the project quite ;</l>
     <l n="74">Attend , and see if all things be not right .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="75">THE project pleased Catella to the soul ;</l>
     <l n="76">Her wrath , no longer able to controul ,</l>
     <l n="77">She Richard stopt ; enough , enough , she cried ;</l>
     <l n="78">I fully understand :— leave me to guide ;</l>
     <l n="79">I 'll play the fellow and his wanton lass</l>
     <l n="80">A pretty trick-shall all their art surpass ,</l>
     <l n="81">Unless the string gives way and spoils my scheme ;</l>
     <l n="82">What , take me for a nincompoop ?— they dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="83">THIS said , she sought excuse to get away ,</l>
     <l n="84">And went in quest of Jack without delay .</l>
     <l n="85">The keeper , howsoe'er , a hint had got ;</l>
     <l n="86">Minutolo had schooled him for the plot ;</l>
     <l n="87">Oft cash does wonders , and , if such the case</l>
     <l n="88">In France or Britain , when conferred a grace ,</l>
     <l n="89">The bribe is taken , and the truth abused ,</l>
     <l n="90">In Italy it will not be refused ;</l>
     <l n="91">There this sole quiver Cupid useful finds ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="92">A purse well stored — all binds , gunlocks , or blinds :</l>
     <l n="93">Jack took the pelf from Richard and the dame ;</l>
     <l n="94">Had Satan offered — ‘ twould have been the same .</l>
     <l n="95">In short , Minutolo had full success ,</l>
     <l n="96">All came about , and marked the spark 's address .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="97">THE lady had at first some warm dispute</l>
     <l n="98">To many questions Jack was even mute ;</l>
     <l n="99">But when he saw the golden charms unmasked ,</l>
     <l n="100">Far more he promised than Catella asked .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="101">THE time of rendezvous arrived , our spark</l>
     <l n="102">To Jack 's repaired , and found the room quite dark ;</l>
     <l n="103">So well arranged , no crevice could he find ,</l>
     <l n="104">Through which the light might hurt what he designed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="105">NOT long he waited , ere our jealous dame ,</l>
     <l n="106">Who longed to find her faithless husband , came ,</l>
     <l n="107">Most thoroughly prepared his ears to greet .</l>
     <l n="108">Jack brought the couple presently to meet .</l>
     <l n="109">The lady found , howe'er , not what she sought :</l>
     <l n="110">No guilty spouse , nor Mrs. Simon caught ;</l>
     <l n="111">But wily Richard , who , without alarms ,</l>
     <l n="112">In silence took Catella in his arms .</l>
     <l n="113">What further passed between the easy pair ,</l>
     <l n="114">Think what you will , I mean not to declare ;</l>
     <l n="115">The lover certainly received delight</l>
     <l n="116">The lady showed no terror nor affright ;</l>
     <l n="117">On neither side a syllable was dropt</l>
     <l n="118">With care Minutolo his laughter stopt ;</l>
     <l n="119">Though difficult , our spark succeeded well ;</l>
     <l n="120">No words of mine can Richard 's pleasure tell .</l>
     <l n="121">His fav'rite beauteous belle he now possessed ,</l>
     <l n="122">And triumphed where so oft he 'd been repressed ,</l>
     <l n="123">Yet fondly hoped her pardon he should get ,</l>
     <l n="124">Since they together had so gaily met .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="125">AT length , the fair could no longer contain :</l>
     <l n="126">Vile wretch , she cried , I 've borne too much ‘ tis plain ;</l>
     <l n="127">I 'm not the fav'rite whom thou had'st in view :</l>
     <l n="128">To tear thy eyes out justly were thy due ,</l>
     <l n="129">‘ Tis this , indeed , that makes thee silent keep ,</l>
     <l n="130">Each morn feign sickness , and pretend to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="131">Thyself reserving doubtless for amours :—</l>
     <l n="132">Speak , villain ! say , of charms have I less stores ?</l>
     <l n="133">Or what has Mrs. Simon more than I ?</l>
     <l n="134">A wanton wench , in tricks so wondrous sly !</l>
     <l n="135">Where my love less ? though truly now I hate ;</l>

     <l n="137">MINUTOLO , while thus Catella spoke ,</l>

     <l n="139">A kiss e'en tried to gain , without success ;</l>
     <l n="140">She struggled , and refused to acquiesce ;</l>
     <l n="141">Begone ! said she , nor treat me like a child ;</l>
     <l n="142">Stand off !— away !— thy taction is defiled ;</l>

     <l n="146">To be so constant :— How was I so weak ?</l>
     <l n="147">It surely would be nothing more than right ,</l>

     <l n="150">You much deserve to be a cuckold made ;</l>
     <l n="151">I 'm half inclined , I vow , to do the worst .</l>
     <l n="152">At this our arch gallant with laughter burst .</l>

     <l n="154">Let 's see , with blushes if his face be dyed ?</l>
     <l n="155">When from his arms she sprang , a window sought ;</l>

     <l n="11">IT happened that Pinucio , young and gay ,</l>
     <l n="12">A youth of family , oft passed the way ,</l>
     <l n="13">Admired the girl , and thought she might be gained ,</l>
     <l n="14">Attentions showed , and like return obtained ;</l>
     <l n="15">The mistress was not deaf , nor lover mute ;</l>
     <l n="16">Pinucio seemed the lady 's taste to suit ,</l>
     <l n="17">Of pleasing person and engaging air ;</l>

     <l n="19">As yet , not one a pref'rence had received ;</l>
     <l n="20">Nor had she e'er in golden dreams believed ;</l>
     <l n="21">But , spite of tender years , her mind was high ,</l>

     <l n="26">And this most clearly for Pinucio 's sake .</l>
     <l n="27">Long conversations she could rarely get ,</l>
     <l n="28">And various obstacles the lovers met ;</l>
     <l n="29">No interviews where they might be at ease ,</l>

     <l n="39">And now the very garrets we have let :</l>
     <l n="40">You 'd better elsewhere try your wish to get ,</l>

     <l n="43">HAVE you no truckle bed ? the lover cried ;</l>
     <l n="44">No corner left ?— we fain would here abide :</l>
     <l n="45">Why , truly , said the host , we always keep</l>
     <l n="46">Two beds within the chamber where we sleep ;</l>
     <l n="47">My wife and I , of course , take one of these ;</l>
     <l n="48">Together lie in t'other if you please .</l>
     <l n="49">The spark replied , this we will gladly do ;</l>

     <l n="51">Pinucio , by Coletta 's sage advice ,</l>
     <l n="52">In looking o'er the room was very nice ;</l>
     <l n="53">With eagle-eyes particulars he traced ,</l>
     <l n="54">Then ‘ tween the clothes himself and friend he placed .</l>
     <l n="55">A camp-bed for the girl was on the floor ;</l>
     <l n="56">The landlord 's , ‘ gainst the wall and next the door ;</l>
     <l n="57">Another opposite the last was set ,</l>
     <l n="58">And this , to guests , at certain times was let ;</l>
     <l n="59">And ‘ tween the two , but near the parents ’ best ,</l>
     <l n="60">A cradle for the child to rest its head ,</l>
     <l n="61">From which a pleasant accident arrived ,</l>
     <l n="62">That our gallant 's young friend of rest deprived .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">WHEN midnight came , and this gay spark supposed</l>
     <l n="64">The host and hostess ’ eyes in sleep were closed ,</l>
     <l n="65">Convinced the time appointed was at hand ,</l>
     <l n="66">To put in execution what was planned ,</l>
     <l n="67">He to the camp-bed silently repaired ,</l>
     <l n="68">And found the belle by Morpheus not insnared ;</l>
     <l n="69">Coletta taught a play that mortals find</l>

     <l n="78">The strangers whom with lodging we provide ;</l>
     <l n="79">But , God be praised , this cradle shows the place</l>
     <l n="80">Where my good husband 's pillow I must trace .</l>
     <l n="81">This said , she with the friend was quickly laid ,</l>

     <l n="88">Or any way by chance the child should wake ,</l>
     <l n="89">He set it carefully beside his bed ,</l>

     <l n="91">ON his return he passed the cradle by ;</l>

     <l n="93">But went to sleep ; when presently a sound ,</l>
     <l n="94">From something that had tumbled , rang around ,</l>
     <l n="95">Awoke his wife , who ran below ,</l>
     <l n="96">That what had happened she might clearly know .</l>
     <l n="97">No fool in such adventures was our Wight :</l>
     <l n="98">The opportunity he would not slight ,</l>
     <l n="99">But played the husband well : no , no , I 'm wrong ;</l>
     <l n="100">He played it ill :— too oft , too much , too long ;</l>
     <l n="101">For whosoe'er would wish to do it well ,</l>

     <l n="103">IN truth , the wife was quite surprised to find</l>

     <l n="116">But , groping to his place the way anew ,</l>
     <l n="117">Pinucio , by the cradle too , was led</l>

     <l n="138">Just then the husband raised himself and sat ;</l>
     <l n="139">Is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage ;</l>
     <l n="140">Was it for THIS you would my house engage ?</l>
     <l n="141">You understand me , but I 'll seek redress ;</l>
     <l n="142">Think you so very cheap to have success ?</l>
     <l n="143">What , would you ruin families at will ,</l>
     <l n="144">And with our daughters take at ease your fill ?</l>
     <l n="145">Away , I say ! my house this moment quit ;</l>

     <l n="149">PINUCIO heard the lecture with dismay ,</l>

     <l n="151">A moment 's silence through the room prevailed ;</l>
     <l n="152">Coletta trembled , and her lot bewailed .</l>
     <l n="153">The hostess now , on ev'ry side perceived</l>
     <l n="154">Her peril great , and for the error grieved .</l>
     <l n="155">The friend , howe'er , the cradle called to mind ,</l>
     <l n="156">Which caused the many ills we 've seen combined ,</l>
     <l n="157">And instantly he cried :— Pinucio ! strange</l>
     <l n="158">You thus allow yourself about to range ;</l>
     <l n="159">Did I not tell you when the wine you took ,</l>
     <l n="160">‘ Twould make many sad misfortunes hook ?</l>

     <l n="166">The husband no suspicion had of guile .</l>
     <l n="167">The stratagem our hostess likewise tried ,</l>

     <l n="169">Where she conceived her fortress was so strong ,</l>
     <l n="170">She presently began to use her tongue ,</l>
     <l n="171">And cried aloud :— Impossible the fact ;</l>
     <l n="172">Such things he could not with Coletta act ;</l>
     <l n="173">I 've with her been in bed throughout the night ,</l>

    <head>ST. JULIAN 'S PRAYER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">TO charms and philters , secret spells and prayers ,</l>
     <l n="2">How many round attribute all their cares !</l>

     <l n="4">And laugh at follies that so much deceive .</l>
     <l n="5">Yet with the beauteous FAIR , ‘ tis very true ,</l>

     <l n="9">MY aim is now to have recourse to these ,</l>
     <l n="10">And give a story that I trust will please ,</l>
     <l n="11">In which Saint Julian 's prayer , to Reynold D'Ast ,</l>
     <l n="12">Produced a benefit , good fortune classed .</l>
     <l n="13">Had he neglected to repeat the charm ,</l>
     <l n="14">Believed so thoroughly to guard from harm ,</l>
     <l n="15">He would have found his cash accounts not right ,</l>
     <l n="16">And passed assuredly a wretched night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">ONE day , to William 's castle as he moved .</l>
     <l n="18">Three men , whose looks he very much approved ,</l>
     <l n="19">And thought such honest fellows he had round ,</l>
     <l n="20">Their like could nowhere be discovered round ;</l>
     <l n="21">Without suspecting any thing was wrong ,</l>
     <l n="22">The three , with complaisance and fluent tongue ,</l>
     <l n="23">Saluted him in humble servile style ,</l>
     <l n="24">And asked , ( the minutes better to beguile ,)</l>
     <l n="25">If they might bear him company the way ;</l>
     <l n="26">The honour would be great , and no delay ;</l>
     <l n="27">Besides , in travelling ‘ tis safer found ,</l>
     <l n="28">And far more pleasant , when the party 's round ;</l>
     <l n="29">So many robbers through the province range ,</l>
     <l n="30">( Continued they ) ‘ tis wonderfully strange ,</l>
     <l n="31">The prince should not these villains more restrain ;</l>
     <l n="32">But there :— bad MEN will somewhere still remain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">TO their proposal Reynold soon agreed ,</l>
     <l n="34">And they resolved together to proceed .</l>
     <l n="35">When ‘ bout a league the travellers had moved ,</l>
     <l n="36">Discussing freely , as they all approved ,</l>
     <l n="37">The conversation turned on spells and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="38">Their pow'r o'er worms of earth , or birds of air ;</l>
     <l n="39">To charm the wolf , or guard from thunder 's roar ,</l>
     <l n="40">And many wonderful achievements more ;</l>
     <l n="41">Besides the cures a prayer would oft produce ;</l>
     <l n="42">To man and beast it proves of sov'reign use ,</l>
     <l n="43">Far greater than from doctors e'er you 'll view ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who , with their Latin , make so much ado .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">IN turn , the three pretended knowledge great ,</l>
     <l n="46">And mystick facts affected to relate ,</l>
     <l n="47">While Reynold silently attention paid</l>
     <l n="48">To all the words the honest fellows said :—</l>
     <l n="49">Possess you not , said one , some secret prayer</l>
     <l n="50">To bring you aid , when dangers round you stare ?</l>
     <l n="51">To this our Reynold seriously replied ,</l>
     <l n="52">Myself , on secret spells , I do not pride ;</l>
     <l n="53">But still some WORDS I have that I repeat ,</l>
     <l n="54">Each morn I travel , that I may not meet</l>
     <l n="55">A horrid lodging where I stop at night ;</l>
     <l n="56">‘ Tis called SAINT JULIAN 'S PRAYER that I recite ,</l>
     <l n="57">And truly I have found , that when I fail</l>
     <l n="58">To say this prayer , I 've reason to bewail .</l>
     <l n="59">But rarely I neglect so good a thing ,</l>
     <l n="60">That ills averts , and may such blessings bring .</l>
     <l n="61">And have you clearly said it , sir , to day ?</l>
     <l n="62">Cried one of those he met upon his way .</l>
     <l n="63">Yes , Reynold answered . Well , replied the Wight ;</l>
     <l n="64">I 'll wage , I 'm better lodged than you to-night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="65">‘ TWAS very cold , and darkness ‘ gan to peep ;</l>
     <l n="66">The place was distant yet , where they might sleep .</l>
     <l n="67">Perhaps , said Reynold , ‘ tis your usual care ,</l>
     <l n="68">In travelling , to say , like me , this prayer .</l>
     <l n="69">Not so , the other cried , to you I vow ,</l>
     <l n="70">Invoking saints is not my practice now ;</l>
     <l n="71">But should I lose , thenceforth I 'll them address .—</l>
     <l n="72">Said Reynold , readily I acquiesce ;</l>
     <l n="73">My life I 'd venture , should you to an inn ,</l>
     <l n="74">For , in the town , I 've neither friend nor kin ,</l>
     <l n="75">And , if you like , we 'll this exception make .</l>
     <l n="76">The other answered : Well , the bet I 'll take ;</l>
     <l n="77">Your horse and coat against my purse you wage ,</l>
     <l n="78">And , sure of gaining , readily engage .</l>
     <l n="79">Our Wight might then have thoroughly perceived ,</l>
     <l n="80">His horse was lost — no chance to be relieved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="81">BESIDE a wood , as on the party moved ,</l>
     <l n="82">The one , who betting had so much approved ,</l>
     <l n="83">Now changed his tone , and in a surly way ,</l>
     <l n="84">Exclaimed :— Alight — you 'll find it time to pray ;</l>
     <l n="85">Let me apprize you , distant is the place ,</l>
     <l n="86">And much you 'll need Saint Julian 's special grace .</l>
     <l n="87">Come off , I tell you :— instantly they took</l>
     <l n="88">His purse , horse , clothes , and all their hands could hook</l>
     <l n="89">E'en seized his boots , and said with subtle sneer ,</l>
     <l n="90">Your feet , by walking , wo n't the worse appear ;</l>
     <l n="91">Then sought a diff'rent road by rapid flight ,</l>
     <l n="92">And , presently the knaves were out of sight ;</l>
     <l n="93">While Reynold still with stockings , drawers , and shirt ,</l>
     <l n="94">But wet to skin , and covered o'er with dirt :</l>
     <l n="95">( The wind north-east in front — as cold as clay ;)</l>
     <l n="96">In doleful dumps proceeded on his way ,</l>
     <l n="97">And justly feared , that spite of faith and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="98">He now should meet , at night , with wretched fare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="99">HOWEVER , some pleasing hopes he still had yet ,</l>
     <l n="100">That , from his cloak-bag , he some clothes might get ;</l>
     <l n="101">For , we should note , a servant he had brought ,</l>
     <l n="102">Who in the neighbourhood a farrier sought .</l>
     <l n="103">To set a shoe upon his horse , and then</l>
     <l n="104">Should join his master on the road agen ;</l>
     <l n="105">But that , as we shall find , was not the case ,</l>
     <l n="106">And Reynold 's dire misfortune thence we trace .</l>
     <l n="107">In fact , the fellow , worthless we 'll suppose ,</l>
     <l n="108">Had viewed from far what accidents arose ,</l>
     <l n="109">Then turned aside , his safety to secure ,</l>
     <l n="110">And left his master dangers to endure ;</l>
     <l n="111">So steadily be kept upon the trot ,</l>
     <l n="112">To Castle-William , ere ‘ twas night , he got ,</l>
     <l n="113">And took the inn which had the most renown ;</l>
     <l n="114">For fare and furniture within the town ,</l>
     <l n="115">There waited Reynold 's coming at his ease ,</l>
     <l n="116">With fire and cheer that could not fail to please .</l>
     <l n="117">His master , up to neck in dirt and wet ,</l>
     <l n="118">Had num'rous difficulties o'er to get ;</l>
     <l n="119">And when the snow , in flakes obscured the air ,</l>
     <l n="120">With piercing cold and winds , he felt despair ;</l>
     <l n="121">Such ills he bore , that hanging might be thought</l>
     <l n="122">A bed of roses rather to be sought .</l>
     <l n="123">CHANCE so arranges ev'ry thing around</l>
     <l n="124">ALL good , or ALL that 's bad is solely found ;</l>
     <l n="125">When favours flow the numbers are so great ,</l>
     <l n="126">That ev'ry wish upon us seems to wait ;</l>
     <l n="127">But , if disposed , misfortunes to bestow ;</l>
     <l n="128">No ills forgot : each poignant pang we know .</l>
     <l n="129">In proof , attend my friends , this very night ,</l>
     <l n="130">The sad adventures that befell our wight ,</l>
     <l n="131">Who , Castle-William did not reach till late ,</l>
     <l n="132">When they , an hour or more , had shut the gate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="133">AT length our traveller approached the wall ,</l>
     <l n="134">And , somehow to the foot contrived to crawl ;</l>
     <l n="135">A roofed projection fortune led him near ,</l>
     <l n="136">That joined a house , and ‘ gan his heart to cheer .</l>
     <l n="137">Delighted with the change he now had got ,</l>
     <l n="138">He placed himself upon the sheltered spot ;</l>
     <l n="139">A lucky hit but seldom comes alone ;</l>
     <l n="140">Some straw , by chance , was near the mansion thrown ,</l>
     <l n="141">Which Reynold ‘ neath the jutting penthouse placed</l>
     <l n="142">There , God be praised , cried he , a bed I 've traced .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="143">MEANWHILE , the storm from ev'ry quarter pressed ;</l>
     <l n="144">Our traveller was soon to death distressed ;</l>
     <l n="145">With cold benumbed ; by fell despair o'erspread ;</l>
     <l n="146">He trembled , groaned :— teeth chattered in his head ;</l>
     <l n="147">So loud his plaints , at length they reached the ear</l>
     <l n="148">Of one who dwelled within the mansion near :</l>
     <l n="149">A servant girl ; her mistress brisk and gay :</l>
     <l n="150">A youthful widow , charming as the day ;</l>
     <l n="151">The governor she privately received :</l>
     <l n="152">A noble marquis , who her cares relieved .</l>
     <l n="153">Oft interrupted when he sought the fair ,</l>
     <l n="154">And wished at ease her company to share ;</l>
     <l n="155">Desirous too of passing quite unknown ,</l>
     <l n="156">A private door he presently was shown ,</l>
     <l n="157">That opened to the fields , and gave access :</l>
     <l n="158">Through this he visited with such address ,</l>
     <l n="159">That none within the town his commerce viewed ,</l>
     <l n="160">Nor e'en a servant 's eye his course pursued .</l>
     <l n="161">Surprise I feel , since pleasures of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="162">Apparently were not for lords designed ;</l>
     <l n="163">More pleased they seem when made the talk around</l>
     <l n="164">And soft amours divulged , delights are found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="165">IT happened that the night our Job arrived ,</l>
     <l n="166">And , stretched on straw , misfortune just survived ,</l>
     <l n="167">The lady thought her fond gallant to see ,</l>
     <l n="168">And ev'ry moment hoped with him to be .</l>
     <l n="169">The supper ready , and the room prepared ,</l>
     <l n="170">Each rarity was served : no trouble spared ;</l>
     <l n="171">Baths , perfumes , wines , most exquisite , in place ,</l>
     <l n="172">And ev'ry thing around displaying grace ,</l>
     <l n="173">With Cupid 's whole artillery in view ,</l>
     <l n="174">Not his , who would with sighs alone pursue ,</l>
     <l n="175">But that kind god who always favour shows ,</l>
     <l n="176">The source of happiness , whence pleasure flows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="177">MEANWHILE , however , while thus the lady sought .</l>
     <l n="178">By ev'ry charm to please , a note was brought ;</l>
     <l n="179">A page conveyed it , by the marquis sent ,</l>
     <l n="180">To say his coming business would prevent .</l>
     <l n="181">The disappointment doubtless was severe ,</l>
     <l n="182">But consolation certainly was near ;</l>
     <l n="183">It proved to Reynold wonderfully kind ,</l>
     <l n="184">For scarcely had our traveller resigned ,</l>
     <l n="185">And groaned aloud , but , tender as her dame ,</l>
     <l n="186">In haste the confidential servant came ,</l>
     <l n="187">And to the widow said :— I hear below</l>
     <l n="188">Some poor unfortunate o'ercome with woe ;</l>
     <l n="189">‘ Tis piercing cold , and he perhaps will die</l>
     <l n="190">Some place , pray grant , where he to-night may lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="191">MOST readily , replied the courteous fair ,</l>
     <l n="192">We never use the garret :— lodge him there ;</l>
     <l n="193">Some straw upon a couch will make a bed ,</l>
     <l n="194">On which the wand'rer may repose his head ;</l>
     <l n="195">Shut well the door , but first provide some meat ,</l>
     <l n="196">And then permit him thither to retreat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="197">WITHOUT this timely help ‘ twas clear our wight</l>
     <l n="198">Had ne'er survived the horrors of the night ;</l>
     <l n="199">The door was ope 'd , and Reynold blessed the hand</l>
     <l n="200">That gave relief , and stopt life 's ebbing sand .</l>
     <l n="201">His tale he told ; got spirits , strength , and ease ;</l>
     <l n="202">In person tall , well made , and formed to please ,</l>
     <l n="203">He looked not like a novice in amour ,</l>
     <l n="204">Though young , and seeking shelter at a door .</l>
     <l n="205">His want of dress and miserable state</l>
     <l n="206">Raised shame indeed , and showed distress was great .</l>
     <l n="207">Though LOVE be seen in Nature 's pure array ,</l>
     <l n="208">No dirt appears , however you survey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="209">THIS servant girl now hastened to the fair ,</l>
     <l n="210">And ev'ry circumstance detailed with care .</l>
     <l n="211">See , said the lady , if within the press</l>
     <l n="212">There be not clothes to furnish him a dress ;</l>
     <l n="213">My husband , now no more , must some have left ;</l>
     <l n="214">Yes , said the girl , you 're not of them bereft ,</l>
     <l n="215">I recollect his wardrobe did abound ;</l>
     <l n="216">And presently a handsome suit she found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="217">MEANWHILE the lady having learned the name</l>
     <l n="218">Of Reynold D'Ast , his quality and fame ,</l>
     <l n="219">( Himself it seems particulars detailed ,</l>
     <l n="220">While all around his suff'rings keen bewailed ,)</l>
     <l n="221">Her orders gave , the bath for her prepared</l>
     <l n="222">Should now receive the man her care had spared .</l>
     <l n="223">Unasked , the stranger this attention got ,</l>
     <l n="224">And well perfumed ere clothes they would allot .</l>
     <l n="225">When dressed , he waited on the widow fair ,</l>
     <l n="226">And paid his compliments with graceful air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="227">THE supper ( for the marquis first designed )</l>
     <l n="228">At length was served with taste the most refined .</l>
     <l n="229">Our trav'ller glad , an appetite displayed ;</l>
     <l n="230">The lady carefully her guest surveyed ,</l>
     <l n="231">And anxious seemed to gratify his wish ,</l>
     <l n="232">By helping what appeared his favourite dish .</l>
     <l n="233">Already , perhaps , she felt a Cupid 's dart ,</l>
     <l n="234">And in her throbbing bosom knew the smart ;</l>
     <l n="235">Or sympathy , or pity for his woes ,</l>
     <l n="236">Might touch the spring whence softest passion flows .</l>
     <l n="237">On ev'ry side assailed the youthful dame</l>
     <l n="238">Herself surrendered unto Cupid 's flame .</l>
     <l n="239">Should I give way , said she , who 'll tell the tale ?</l>
     <l n="240">No risk is run if secrecy prevail .</l>
     <l n="241">The marquis merits to be played the trick ;</l>
     <l n="242">He no excuse can have , unless he 's sick .</l>
     <l n="243">One sin against another I may weigh ,</l>
     <l n="244">And man for man will equally repay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="245">SO inexperienced Reynold was not found ,</l>
     <l n="246">But that he saw how things were going round ,</l>
     <l n="247">And , that Saint Julian 's Prayer would yet succeed ,</l>
     <l n="248">To give him all the lodging he might need .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="249">THE supper o'er , our couple left alone ,</l>
     <l n="250">What fairer field could truly have been shown ?</l>
     <l n="251">The belle now wore a smart becoming dress ,</l>
     <l n="252">Designed , in ev'ry view , to prepossess .</l>
     <l n="253">‘ Twas NEGLIGENCE , so requisite to please</l>
     <l n="254">And fascinate , with airy , careless ease ,</l>
     <l n="255">According to the taste which I pursue ,</l>
     <l n="256">That made her charms so exquisite to view .</l>
     <l n="257">No gaudy tinsel : all was flowing light ;</l>
     <l n="258">Though not superb , yet pleasing to the sight ;</l>
     <l n="259">A neckerchief , where much should be concealed ,</l>
     <l n="260">Was made so narrow ,— beauties half revealed ;</l>
     <l n="261">Beneath is shade — what words can ne'er express ;</l>
     <l n="262">And Reynold saw enough the rest to guess .</l>
     <l n="263">No more I say ; the belle indeed was fair ,</l>
     <l n="264">Possessed of youth and all engaging air ;</l>
     <l n="265">Tall , nicely formed ; each grace , that hearts could win ;</l>
     <l n="266">Not much of fat , nor yet appeared too thin .</l>
     <l n="267">Emotion , at the view , who would not feel ?</l>
     <l n="268">To soft delight what bosom proves of steel ?</l>
     <l n="269">No marble bust , philosopher , nor stone ,</l>
     <l n="270">But similar sensation would have shown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="271">THE silence first was broken by the dame ;</l>
     <l n="272">Who spoke so freely , Reynold bolder came .</l>
     <l n="273">He knew not well , howe'er , discourse to find ;</l>
     <l n="274">To help him out the widow was inclined ;</l>
     <l n="275">Said she , you much remind me of a friend ,</l>
     <l n="276">Whose ev'ry wish I sought with mine to blend</l>
     <l n="277">My husband ( rest his soul ! ) had just those eyes ,</l>
     <l n="278">That look , air , mouth :— the very height and size :</l>
     <l n="279">You greatly honour me , the spark replied :</l>
     <l n="280">Your charms howe'er might well have been his pride ;</l>
     <l n="281">I ne'er beheld such soft engaging mien :</l>
     <l n="282">On earth , like beauty never yet was seen .</l>
     <l n="283">But , in extremes to be , appears my lot ;</l>
     <l n="284">Just now I felt quite chilled :— at present hot ;</l>
     <l n="285">Pray tell me which is best ? The fair looked down ,</l>
     <l n="286">And humbly seemed to wave the proffered crown ,</l>
     <l n="287">That she might still more flattery receive</l>
     <l n="288">Address not small , if we 'll our eyes believe .</l>
     <l n="289">The swain now praised each charm within his view ,</l>
     <l n="290">And whatsoe'er his wishes could pursue ;</l>
     <l n="291">Where hope was strong , and expectation high ,</l>
     <l n="292">She would not long be cruel and deny .</l>
     <l n="293">To give the praise , your due , the lover cried ,</l>
     <l n="294">And note the beauties that my heart divide ,</l>
     <l n="295">‘ Twould take an age , and I 've a single night ,</l>
     <l n="296">Which surely might be passed with more delight .</l>
     <l n="297">The widow smiled ; enough it seems was said ;</l>
     <l n="298">And Reynold shortened — what to nothing led .</l>
     <l n="299">In war or love , time equally is dear ;</l>
     <l n="300">More happy than our spark none could appear ;</l>
     <l n="301">No point but what he gained ; the smiling dame</l>
     <l n="302">Resistance only showed to raise the flame ;</l>
     <l n="303">Nor more nor less ; each belle like art has got ,</l>
     <l n="304">And practises at will , or maid or not .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="305">BUT truly , it was never my intent</l>
     <l n="306">To count each favour she to Reynold lent ;</l>
     <l n="307">Particulars exact of ev'ry kiss ,</l>
     <l n="308">And all the preludes incident to bliss ;</l>
     <l n="309">Both , doubtless , knew more ways than one to please ;</l>
     <l n="310">And sought , with anxious care , love 's charms to seize .</l>
     <l n="311">On recollection of the wretched state</l>
     <l n="312">In which our traveller had moved of late ,</l>
     <l n="313">Some favour was bestowed :— there , cried the dame ,</l>
     <l n="314">Is something to repay the road you came ;</l>
     <l n="315">This for the cold ; that fear ; there thieves disgraced ;</l>
     <l n="316">So , one by one , the whole was soon effaced .</l>
     <l n="317">In this way to be paid for ills we meet ,</l>
     <l n="318">Who 'd not be satisfied with boons so sweet ?</l>
     <l n="319">And we conclude , that Reynold on the spot ,</l>
     <l n="320">Love 's am'rous recompense of pleasures got .</l>
     <l n="321">Now easy conversation was renewed ;</l>
     <l n="322">Then mutual kisses ; ev'ry sweet pursued .</l>
     <l n="323">‘ Twas time for bed ; howe'er , the widow fair</l>
     <l n="324">Determined that her own the spark should share ;</l>
     <l n="325">‘ Twas prudent , doubtless ; like a lady wise ;</l>
     <l n="326">Gallantly done : one room would well suffice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="327">WHAT further passed betwixt the pair that night ;</l>
     <l n="328">I cannot say , though we 'll believe ‘ twas right ;</l>
     <l n="329">Between the clothes when laid , and unrestrained ,</l>
     <l n="330">Most clearly , Reynold all his wishes gained .</l>
     <l n="331">There he was recompensed for ev'ry grief ;</l>
     <l n="332">The lady too , received so much relief ,</l>
     <l n="333">That she desired his company again ,</l>
     <l n="334">But still these visits secrets should remain ;</l>
     <l n="335">‘ Twas requisite the governor to see ;</l>
     <l n="336">Howe'er the dame delighted seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="337">And not content with what she had bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="338">A purse well stored with gold to Reynold showed :</l>
     <l n="339">He took no more , indeed , than what would pay</l>
     <l n="340">The bare expenses on his homeward way ;</l>
     <l n="341">Then sought the street that to the tavern led ,</l>
     <l n="342">Where still his lazy servant was in bed ;</l>
     <l n="343">The fellow mauled ; then changed throughout his dress ;</l>
     <l n="344">Since to the cloak-bag now he had access .</l>
     <l n="345">His fortune to complete , that day they took</l>
     <l n="346">The very wretches that he wished to hook .</l>
     <l n="347">He to the judge repaired with ev'ry haste ;</l>
     <l n="348">In such a case you never time should waste ;</l>
     <l n="349">For , once the things are into court received ,</l>
     <l n="350">‘ Tis like the lion 's den : naught e'er ‘ s retrieved ;</l>
     <l n="351">Their hands are closed , not ‘ gainst what may be brought</l>
     <l n="352">But to secure what from their grasp is sought .</l>
     <l n="353">Who seeks redress by law , facts oft have shown ,</l>
     <l n="354">May bless his stars if he but keep his own .</l>

     <l n="5">Bab ( such her name , and daughter of a knight )</l>
     <l n="6">Was airy , buxom : formed for am'rous fight .</l>
     <l n="7">Hans , holding jeers and cuckoldom in dread ,</l>
     <l n="8">Would have his precious rib with caution tread ,</l>
     <l n="9">And nothing but the Bible e'er peruse ;</l>
     <l n="10">All other books he daily would abuse ;</l>
     <l n="11">Blamed secret visits ; frowned at loose attire ;</l>
     <l n="12">And censured ev'ry thing gallants admire .</l>
     <l n="13">The dame , howe'er , was deaf to all he said ;</l>
     <l n="14">No preaching pleased but what to pleasure led ,</l>
     <l n="15">Which made the aged husband hold his tongue .</l>
     <l n="16">And wish for death , since all round went wrong .</l>
     <l n="17">Some easy moments he perhaps might get ;</l>
     <l n="18">A full detail in hist'ry ' s page is met .</l>
     <l n="19">One night , when company he 'd had to dine ,</l>
     <l n="20">And pretty well was fill 'd with gen'rous wine ,</l>
     <l n="21">Hans dreamed , as near his wife he snoring lay ,</l>
     <l n="22">The devil came his compliments to pay ,</l>
     <l n="23">And having on his finger put a ring ,</l>
     <l n="24">Said he , friend Hans , I know thou feel'st a sting ;</l>
     <l n="25">Thy trouble ‘ s great : I pity much thy case ;</l>
     <l n="26">Let but this ring , howe'er , thy finger grace ,</l>
     <l n="27">And while ‘ tis there I 'll answer with my head ,</l>
     <l n="28">THAT ne'er shall happen which is now thy dread :</l>
     <l n="29">Hans , quite delighted , forced his finger through ;</l>
     <l n="30">You drunken beast , cried Bab , what would you do ?</l>
     <l n="31">To love 's devoirs quite lost , you take no care ,</l>
     <l n="32">And now have thrust your finger God knows where !</l>

     <l n="1">WHEN Venus and Hypocrisy combine ,</l>
     <l n="2">Oft pranks are played that show a deep design ;</l>
     <l n="3">Men are but men , and friars full as weak :</l>

     <l n="11">A HERMIT , full of youth , was thought around ,</l>
     <l n="12">A saint , and worthy of the legend found .</l>
     <l n="13">The holy man a knotted cincture wore ;</l>
     <l n="14">But , ‘ neath his garb :— heart-rotten to the core .</l>
     <l n="15">A chaplet from his twisted girdle hung ,</l>
     <l n="16">Of size extreme , and regularly strung ,</l>
     <l n="17">On t'other side was worn a little bell ;</l>
     <l n="18">The hypocrite in ALL , he acted well ;</l>
     <l n="19">And if a female near his cell appeared ,</l>
     <l n="20">He 'd keep within as if the sex he feared ,</l>
     <l n="21">With downcast eyes and looks of woe complete ,</l>
     <l n="22">You 'd ne'er suppose that butter he could eat .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">NOT far from where the hermit 's cell was placed ,</l>
     <l n="24">Within a village dwelled a widow chaste ;</l>
     <l n="25">Her residence was at the further end</l>
     <l n="26">And all her store — a daughter as a friend ,</l>
     <l n="27">Who candour , youth , and charms supreme possessed ;</l>
     <l n="28">And still a virgin lived , howe'er distressed .</l>
     <l n="29">Though if the real truth perhaps we name ,</l>
     <l n="30">‘ Twas more simplicity than virtuous aim ;</l>
     <l n="31">Not much of industry , but honest heart ;</l>
     <l n="32">No wealth , nor lovers , who might hope impart .</l>
     <l n="33">In Adam 's days , when all with clothes were born ,</l>
     <l n="34">She doubtless might like finery have worn ;</l>
     <l n="35">A house was furnished then without expense ;</l>
     <l n="36">For sheets or mattresses you 'd no pretence ;</l>
     <l n="37">Not e'en a bed was necessary thought</l>
     <l n="38">No blankets , pillowbiers , nor quilts were bought .</l>
     <l n="39">Those times are o'er ; then Hymen came alone ;</l>

     <l n="41">OUR anchorite , in begging through the place ;</l>

     <l n="47">QUITE near the open fields they lived , I 've said ;</l>
     <l n="48">An humble , boarded cottage o'er their head .</l>
     <l n="49">One charming night — no , I mistake ‘ tis plain ,</l>
     <l n="50">Our hermit , favoured much by wind and rain ,</l>
     <l n="51">Pierced in the boarding , where by time ‘ twas worn ;</l>
     <l n="52">A hole through which he introduced a horn ;</l>
     <l n="53">And loudly bawled :— attend to what I say ,</l>
     <l n="54">Ye women , my commands at once obey .</l>
     <l n="55">This voice spread terror through the little cot ;</l>
     <l n="56">Both hid their heads and trembled for their lot ;</l>
     <l n="57">But still our monk his horn would sound aloud</l>
     <l n="58">Awake ! cried he ; your favour God has vowed ;</l>
     <l n="59">My faithful servant , Lucius , haste to seek ;</l>
     <l n="60">At early dawn go find this hermit meek</l>
     <l n="61">To no one say a word : ‘ tis Heav'n ordains ;</l>
     <l n="62">Fear nothing , Lucius ever blessed remains ;</l>
     <l n="63">I 'll show the way myself : your daughter place ,</l>
     <l n="64">Good widow , with this holy man of grace ;</l>
     <l n="65">And from their intercourse a pope shall spring ,</l>
     <l n="66">Who back to virtue christendom will bring .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="67">HE spoke to them so very loud and clear ,</l>
     <l n="68">They heard , though ‘ neath the clothes half dead with fear .</l>
     <l n="69">Some time howe'er the females lay in dread ;</l>
     <l n="70">At length the daughter ventured out her head ,</l>
     <l n="71">And , pulling hastily her parent 's arm ,</l>
     <l n="72">Said she , dear mother , ( not suspecting harm )</l>
     <l n="73">Good Heav'ns ! must I obey and thither go ?</l>
     <l n="74">What would the holy man on me bestow ?</l>
     <l n="75">I know not what to say nor how to act ;</l>
     <l n="76">Now cousin Anne would with him be exact ,</l>
     <l n="77">And better recollect his sage advice :—</l>
     <l n="78">Fool ! said the mother , never be so nice ;</l>
     <l n="79">Go , nothing fear , and do whate'er ' s desired ;</l>
     <l n="80">Much understanding will not be required ;</l>
     <l n="81">The first or second time thou'lt get thy cue ,</l>
     <l n="82">And cousin Anne will less know what to do .</l>
     <l n="83">Indeed ? the girl replied ; well , let 's away ,</l>
     <l n="84">And we 'll return to bed without delay .</l>
     <l n="85">But softly , cried the mother with a smile ;</l>
     <l n="86">Not quite so fast , for Satan may beguile ;</l>
     <l n="87">And if ‘ twere so , hast taken proper care ?</l>
     <l n="88">I think he spoke like one who would ensnare .</l>
     <l n="89">To be precipitate , in such a case ,</l>
     <l n="90">Perhaps might lead at once to dire disgrace .</l>
     <l n="91">If thou wert terrified and did'st not hear ,</l>
     <l n="92">Myself I 'm sure was quite o'ercome with fear .</l>
     <l n="93">No , no , rejoined the daughter , I am right :</l>
     <l n="94">I clearly heard , dear mother , spite of fright .</l>
     <l n="95">Well then , replied the widow , let us pray ,</l>
     <l n="96">That we by Satan be not led astray .</l>

     <l n="97">AT length they both arose when morning came ,</l>
     <l n="98">And through the day the converse was the same .</l>
     <l n="99">At night howe'er the horn was heard once more ,</l>
     <l n="100">And terrified the females as before .</l>
     <l n="101">Thou unbelieving woman , cried the voice ,</l>
     <l n="102">For certain purposes of God the choice ;</l>
     <l n="103">No more delay , but to the hermit fly ,</l>
     <l n="104">Or ‘ tis decreed that thou shalt quickly die .</l>
     <l n="105">Now , mother , said the girl , I told you well ;</l>
     <l n="106">Come , let us hasten to the hermit 's cell ;</l>
     <l n="107">So much I dread your death , I 'll nothing shun ;</l>
     <l n="108">And if ‘ tis requisite , I 'll even run .</l>
     <l n="109">Away then , cried the mother , let us go ;</l>
     <l n="110">Some pains to dress , the daughter would bestow ,</l>
     <l n="111">Without reflecting what might be her fare :—</l>

     <l n="113">OUR monk was on the watch you may suppose ;</l>
     <l n="114">A hole he made that would a glimpse disclose ;</l>
     <l n="115">By which , when near his cell the females drew ,</l>
     <l n="116">They might , with whip in hand the hermit view ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who , like a culprit punished for his crimes ,</l>
     <l n="118">Received the lash , and that so many times ,</l>
     <l n="119">It sounded like the discipline of schools ,</l>
     <l n="120">And made more noise than flogging fifty fools .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="121">WHEN first our pilgrims knocked , he would not hear ;</l>
     <l n="122">And , for the moment , whipping would appear ;</l>

     <l n="124">Which , through the hole , with pain our females spied ;</l>
     <l n="125">At length the door he ope 'd , but from his eyes</l>
     <l n="126">No satisfaction beamed : he showed surprise .</l>
     <l n="127">With trembling knees and blushes o'er the face ,</l>
     <l n="128">The widow now explained the mystick case .</l>
     <l n="129">Six steps behind , the beauteous daughter stood ,</l>
     <l n="130">And waited the decree she thought so good .</l>
     <l n="131">The hypocrite howe'er the hermit played ,</l>
     <l n="132">And sent these humble pilgrims back dismayed .</l>
     <l n="133">Said he , the evil spirit much I dread ;</l>
     <l n="134">No female to my cell should e'er be led ;</l>
     <l n="135">Excuse me then : such acts would sorrow bring ;</l>
     <l n="136">From me the HOLY FATHER ne'er spring .</l>
     <l n="137">What ne'er from you ? the widow straight replied :</l>
     <l n="138">And why should not the blessing , pray , be tried ?</l>
     <l n="139">No other answer howsoe'er she got ;</l>
     <l n="140">So back they trudged once more to gain their cot .</l>
     <l n="141">Ah ! mother , said the girl , ‘ tis my belief ,</l>

     <l n="146">To-morrow you 'll have due attention shown ;</l>
     <l n="147">I 've changed the hermit 's cold fastidious mind ,</l>

     <l n="1">WHEN Cupid with his dart , would hearts assail ,</l>
     <l n="2">The rampart most secure is not the VEIL ;</l>
     <l n="3">A husband better will the FAIR protect ,</l>
     <l n="4">Than walls or lattices , I much suspect .</l>
     <l n="5">Those parents , who in nunneries have got</l>
     <l n="6">Their daughters ( whether willingly or not ) ,</l>
     <l n="7">Most clearly in a glaring error prove ,</l>
     <l n="8">To fancy God will round their actions move ;</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Tis an abuse of what we hold divine ;</l>
     <l n="10">The Devil with them surely must combine .</l>
     <l n="11">Besides , ‘ twere folly to suppose that vice</l>
     <l n="12">Ne'er entered convent walls , and nuns were ice .</l>
     <l n="13">A very diff'rent sentiment I hold :</l>
     <l n="14">Girls , who in publick move , however bold ,</l>
     <l n="15">Have greater terrors lest they get a stain ;</l>
     <l n="16">For , honour lost , they never fame regain .</l>
     <l n="17">Few enemies their modesty attack ;</l>
     <l n="18">The others have but one their minds to rack .</l>
     <l n="19">TEMPTATION , daughter of the drowsy dame ,</l>
     <l n="20">That hates to move , and IDLENESS we name ,</l>
     <l n="21">Is ever practising each wily art ,</l>
     <l n="22">To spread her snares around the throbbing heart ;</l>
     <l n="23">And fond DESIRE , the child of lorn CONSTRAINT ,</l>
     <l n="24">Is anxious to the soul soft scenes to paint .</l>
     <l n="25">If I 've a worthy daughter made a nun ,</l>
     <l n="26">Is that a reason she 's a saint ?— Mere fun !</l>
     <l n="27">Avaunt such folly !— three in four you 'll find ,</l>
     <l n="28">Of those who wear the veil — have changed their mind ;</l>
     <l n="29">Their fingers bite , and often do much worse :</l>
     <l n="30">Those convent vows , full soon , become a curse ;</l>
     <l n="31">Such things at least have sometimes reached my ear</l>
     <l n="32">( For doubtless I must speak from others here ) ;</l>
     <l n="33">Of his Boccace a merry tale has told ,</l>

     <l n="38">And kept their tongues in motion through the day .</l>
     <l n="39">Religious duties they regarded less ,</l>
     <l n="40">Than for the palour * to be nice in dress</l>
     <l n="41">Arranging ev'ry article to please ,</l>
     <l n="42">That each might captivate and charm at ease ;</l>
     <l n="43">The changes constantly they rang around ,</l>
     <l n="44">And made the convent-walls with din resound .</l>
     <l n="45">Eight sisters and an abbess held the place ,</l>
     <l n="46">And strange to say — there DISCORD you might trace .</l>
     <l n="47">All nine had youth , and many beauty too :</l>
     <l n="48">Young friars round the place were oft in view ,</l>
     <l n="49">Who reckoned ev'ry step they took so well ,</l>

     <l n="51">Th ’ aged gard'ner , of whom ere now we spoke ,</l>

     <l n="53">Capricious , whimsical , from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="54">Each would command and try to have her way ;</l>
     <l n="55">And as they ne'er agreed among themselves ,</l>
     <l n="56">He suffered more than if with fifty elves ;</l>
     <l n="57">When one was pleased , another soon complained :</l>
     <l n="58">At length to quit the nuns he was constrained .</l>
     <l n="59">He left them , poor and wretched as he came ;</l>

     <l n="61">A YOUTH of Lamporechio , gay and bold ,</l>
     <l n="62">One day this gard'ner met as I am told ;</l>
     <l n="63">And after conversation ‘ bout the place ,</l>
     <l n="64">Said , he should like nun 's service to embrace ,</l>
     <l n="65">And that he wished sincerely to be hired :</l>
     <l n="66">He 'd gratis do whatever was required .</l>
     <l n="67">‘ Twas clear indeed his object was not pelf ;</l>
     <l n="68">He thought however he might reward himself ;</l>
     <l n="69">And as the sisters were not over wise ,</l>
     <l n="70">A nun he now and then might make his prize ;</l>
     <l n="71">Proceed from one to more with like address ,</l>
     <l n="72">Till with the whole he 'd had complete success .</l>
     <l n="73">Said Nuto ( such we find the gard'ner ' s name ) ,</l>
     <l n="74">Believe me , friend , you will be much to blame ;</l>
     <l n="75">Some other service seek , I recommend ;</l>
     <l n="76">These convent-dames will ne'er their whimseys end .</l>
     <l n="77">I 'd rather live without or soup or bread ,</l>
     <l n="78">Than work for them , however nicely fed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="79">STRANGE creatures are these nuns , upon my word ;</l>
     <l n="80">Their ways ridiculous and e'en absurd ;</l>
     <l n="81">Who , with the sisterhood , has never been ,</l>
     <l n="82">Has clearly yet , not perfect torment seen ,</l>
     <l n="83">Such service , prithee , never try to gain ;</l>
     <l n="84">To do what they require I know is vain ;</l>
     <l n="85">One will have soft , and t'other asks for hard :</l>
     <l n="86">Thou'lt be a fool such ninnies to regard ;</l>
     <l n="87">No work thou'lt do , whatever be the want :</l>
     <l n="88">THIS cabbages ,— THAT carrots tells thee plant :</l>
     <l n="89">Said t'other , fain I 'd bring it to the test ;</l>
     <l n="90">I 'm but a simpleton , it is confessed ;</l>
     <l n="91">Yet still a month in place , and thou wilt see ;</l>
     <l n="92">How well I with the convent-dames agree .</l>
     <l n="93">The reason is , my life is in its prime ,</l>
     <l n="94">While thou art sunk in years and worn by time ,</l>
     <l n="95">I 'm proper for their work , and only ask ,</l>
     <l n="96">To be admitted to the drudging task .</l>
     <l n="97">Well , said the former , if resolved to try ,</l>
     <l n="98">To their factotum instantly apply ;</l>
     <l n="99">Come ; let 's away . Lead on , the other cried ;</l>
     <l n="100">I 've got a thought , which I 'll to you confide :—</l>
     <l n="101">I 'll seem an idiot , and quite dumb appear .—</l>
     <l n="102">In that , said Nuto , only persevere ,</l>
     <l n="103">And then perhaps the confessor thou'lt find ,</l>
     <l n="104">With their factotum carelessly inclined ;</l>
     <l n="105">No fears nor dark suspicions of a mute :</l>
     <l n="106">Thou'lt ev'ry way , my friend , their wishes suit .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="107">THE place , as was expected , soon he got ;</l>
     <l n="108">And half the grounds to trench , at once his lot :</l>
     <l n="109">He acted well the nincompoop and fool ,</l>
     <l n="110">Yet still was steady to the garden tool ;</l>
     <l n="111">The nuns continually would flock around ,</l>
     <l n="112">And much amusement in his anticks found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="113">ONE day , as sleeping lay our sprightly wight ,</l>
     <l n="114">Or feigning sleep , no matter which is right ,</l>
     <l n="115">( Boccace pretends the latter was the fact )</l>
     <l n="116">Two nuns ( perhaps not two the most exact ,)</l>
     <l n="117">Observing him extended on the sward ,</l>
     <l n="118">While summer 's heat from air so much debarred ;</l>
     <l n="119">That few would venture from the convent-roof ,</l>
     <l n="120">Lest , ‘ gainst the sun , their cheeks should not be proof :</l>
     <l n="121">Said one , approaching him , let 's take this fool ,</l>
     <l n="122">And place him in the garden-house to cool .</l>
     <l n="123">The lad was handsome , with engaging mien :</l>
     <l n="124">The nun admired the features she had seen ,</l>
     <l n="125">And Cupid raised a wish to be at ease ,</l>
     <l n="126">Where she , without restraint , herself might please .</l>
     <l n="127">What would you , cried the other , with him do ?</l>
     <l n="128">You 'll see , rejoined the first , if we pursue ;</l>
     <l n="129">Just what might be expected from the place ;</l>
     <l n="130">Christ ! said the second ( with a cross of grace ) ,</l>
     <l n="131">You would not surely do what is forbid ?</l>
     <l n="132">Suppose increase ? it never could be hid ;</l>
     <l n="133">Besides , should we be seen , ‘ twill be the cause ,</l>
     <l n="134">Of dire disgrace to break such sacred laws .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="135">WE shall not be observed , the first replied ;</l>
     <l n="136">These ills thy fancy forms : haste , let 's decide ,</l>
     <l n="137">And seize the moment while ‘ tis in our reach ,</l>
     <l n="138">Without regard to what old dotards teach ,</l>
     <l n="139">Or what may happen at a future hour ;</l>
     <l n="140">Here 's no one near : ‘ tis fully in our pow'r ;</l>
     <l n="141">The time and place so thoroughly agree ,</l>
     <l n="142">‘ Twill be impossible our freaks to see ;</l>
     <l n="143">But ‘ twill be right that one should watch with care ;</l>
     <l n="144">While t'other with the lad seeks joys to share ,</l>
     <l n="145">And irksome gloom endeavours to dispel :</l>
     <l n="146">He 's dumb , you know , and tales can never tell .</l>
     <l n="147">The other answered , since ‘ tis your desire ,</l>
     <l n="148">I 'll acquiesce and do what you require ;</l>
     <l n="149">You 'll take him first : I see it is your aim ;</l>
     <l n="150">And since it will oblige , I 'll wave my claim ;</l>
     <l n="151">Go , pleasure seek , and satisfy each wish :</l>
     <l n="152">You 're always anxious for a fav'rite dish ;</l>
     <l n="153">‘ Tis only to oblige that I comply .</l>
     <l n="154">That , said the other , clearly I descry ;</l>
     <l n="155">I 'm well persuaded , thou art always kind ;</l>
     <l n="156">But still I think thou would'st not be inclined ;</l>
     <l n="157">In such a scene to take the leading part ,</l>
     <l n="158">Thy bashfulness would counteract thy heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="159">Some time the squeamish sister watched the spot ;</l>
     <l n="160">At length the other , who 'd her wishes got ,</l>
     <l n="161">The station took ; the lab'rer tried to please</l>
     <l n="162">The second as the first , but less at ease ;</l>
     <l n="163">So many favours fell not to her share ,</l>
     <l n="164">And only treble comfort proved her fare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="165">THE garden-path , and summer-house as well ,</l>
     <l n="166">Were well remembered by each wanton belle ;</l>
     <l n="167">No need of guides ; and soon our spark contrived ;</l>
     <l n="168">With sister Agnes also to be hived</l>
     <l n="169">A press-house at the convent end he chose ,</l>
     <l n="170">in which he showed her how soft pleasure flows ;</l>
     <l n="171">Nor Claudia nor Angelica would miss</l>
     <l n="172">The dormitory that , and cellar this ;</l>
     <l n="173">In short the garret and the vaulted cave</l>
     <l n="174">Knew fully how the sisters could behave ;</l>
     <l n="175">Not one but what he first or last regaled</l>
     <l n="176">E'en with the rigid abbess he prevailed ,</l>
     <l n="177">To take a dance , and as the dame required</l>
     <l n="178">Her treble share of what was most admired ,</l>
     <l n="179">The other nuns were oft obliged to fast ,</l>
     <l n="180">While with the convent-head his time was passed .</l>

     <l n="184">That with the abbess , when engaged one day ,</l>
     <l n="185">He said , where'er I go , ‘ tis common talk ,</l>
     <l n="186">With only sev'n an able bird should walk ,</l>
     <l n="187">Yet constantly I 've got no less than nine :—</l>
     <l n="188">The abbess cried ,— A miracle divine !</l>

     <l n="190">We 've fasted with success :— his tongue is found .</l>
     <l n="191">The eight encircled him with great surprise ;</l>

     <l n="193">A consultation instantly was had ,</l>

     <l n="199">He for the nuns procured a little lot ,</l>
     <l n="200">That afterward two little friars got ,</l>
     <l n="201">And in the sequel fathers soon became ;</l>
     <l n="202">The sisters mothers too , in spite of shame ;</l>

    <head>THE MANDRAKE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">FLORENTINE we now design to show ;—</l>
     <l n="2">A greater blockhead ne'er appeared below ;</l>
     <l n="3">It seems a prudent woman he had wed ,</l>
     <l n="4">With beauty that might grace a monarch 's bed ;</l>
     <l n="5">Young , brisk , good-humoured , with engaging mien ;</l>
     <l n="6">None in the town , or round , the like was seen :</l>
     <l n="7">Her praises every voice inclined to sing ,</l>
     <l n="8">And judged her worthy of a mighty king ;</l>
     <l n="9">At least a better husband she deserved :</l>
     <l n="10">An arrant fool he looked , and quite unnerved .</l>
     <l n="11">This Nicia Calfucci ( for such his name )</l>
     <l n="12">Was fully bent to have a father 's fame ,</l>
     <l n="13">And thought his country honour he could do ,</l>
     <l n="14">Could he contrive his lineage to pursue .</l>
     <l n="15">No holy saint in Paradise was blessed ,</l>
     <l n="16">But what this husband fervently addressed ;</l>
     <l n="17">From day to day , so oft he teazed for grace ,</l>
     <l n="18">They scarcely knew his off'rings where to place .</l>
     <l n="19">No matron , quack , nor conjurer around ,</l>
     <l n="20">But what he tried their qualities profound ;</l>
     <l n="21">Yet all in vain : in spite of charm or book ,</l>
     <l n="22">No father he , whatever pains he took .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">TO Florence then returned a youth from France ;</l>
     <l n="24">Where he had studied ,— more than complaisance :</l>
     <l n="25">Well trained as any from that polished court ;</l>
     <l n="26">To Fortune 's favours anxious to resort ;</l>
     <l n="27">Gallant and seeking ev'ry FAIR to please ;</l>
     <l n="28">Each house , road , alley , soon he knew at ease ;</l>
     <l n="29">The husbands , good or bad , their whims and years ,</l>
     <l n="30">With ev'ry thing that moved their hopes or fears ;</l>
     <l n="31">What sort of fuel best their females charmed ;</l>
     <l n="32">What spies were kept by those who felt alarmed ;</l>
     <l n="33">The if 's , for 's , to 's , and ev'ry artful wile ,</l>
     <l n="34">That might in love a confidant beguile ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or nurse , or father-confessor , or dog ;</l>

     <l n="37">THE snares were spread , each stratagem was laid ;</l>
     <l n="38">And every thing arranged to furnish aid ,</l>
     <l n="39">When our gay spark determined to invest</l>
     <l n="40">Old Nicia with the cuckold 's branching crest .</l>
     <l n="41">The plan no doubt was well conceived and bold ;</l>
     <l n="42">The lady to her friends appeared not cold ;</l>
     <l n="43">Within her husband 's house she seemed polite ;</l>
     <l n="44">But ne'er familiarly was seen invite ,</l>
     <l n="45">No further could a lover dare proceed ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">OUR youth , Calimachus , no sooner came ,</l>

     <l n="49">His camp he pitched and entered on the siege</l>
     <l n="50">Of fair Lucretia , faithful to her liege ,</l>
     <l n="51">Who presently the haughty tigress played ,</l>
     <l n="52">And sent him , like the rest , away dismayed .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="53">HE , scarcely knew what saint he could invoke ;</l>

     <l n="57">With all his heart , and nothing fancy wrong ;</l>
     <l n="58">That might to others possibly belong .</l>
     <l n="59">The lover and himself , as learned men ,</l>
     <l n="60">Had conversations ev'ry now and then ;</l>
     <l n="61">For Nicia was a doctor in the law :</l>
     <l n="62">Degree , to him , not worth a single straw ;</l>

     <l n="65">ONE day he to Calimachus complained ,</l>

     <l n="69">When I at Paris was , replied our wight ,</l>
     <l n="70">There passed a clever man , a curious sight ,</l>
     <l n="71">His company with anxious care I sought ,</l>
     <l n="72">And was at length a hundred secrets taught ;</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Mong others how , at will , to get an heir :—</l>
     <l n="74">A certain thing , he often would declare ;</l>
     <l n="75">The great Mogul had tried it on his queen ,</l>
     <l n="76">just two years since , the heir might then be seen ;</l>
     <l n="77">And many other princesses of fame ,</l>
     <l n="78">Had added by it to their husband 's name .</l>
     <l n="79">‘ Twas very true ; I 've seen it fully proved :</l>
     <l n="80">The remedy all obstacles removed ;</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Tis from the root of certain tree expressed ;</l>
     <l n="82">A juice most potent ev'ry where confessed ,</l>

     <l n="84">More pow'r evinces o'er organick life ,</l>
     <l n="85">Than from conventual grace was e'er derived ,</l>

     <l n="1">DAN CUPID , though the god of soft amour ,</l>
     <l n="2">In ev'ry age works miracles a store ;</l>
     <l n="3">Can Catos change to male coquets at ease ;</l>
     <l n="4">And fools make oracles whene'er he please ;</l>
     <l n="5">Turn wolves to sheep , and ev'ry thing so well ,</l>
     <l n="6">That naught remains the former shape to tell :</l>
     <l n="7">Remember , Hercules , with wond'rous pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="8">And Polyphemus , who would men devour :</l>
     <l n="9">The one upon a rock himself would fling ,</l>
     <l n="10">And to the winds his am'rous ditties sing ;</l>
     <l n="11">To cut his beard a nymph could him inspire ;</l>
     <l n="12">And , in the water , he 'd his face admire .</l>
     <l n="13">His club the other to a spindle changed ,</l>

     <l n="15">A hundred instances the fact attest ,</l>

     <l n="22">LOVE licked the cub , and decent soon he grew .</l>
     <l n="23">A fine gallant at length the lad appeared ;</l>
     <l n="24">From whence the change ?— Fine eyes his bosom cheered</l>
     <l n="25">The piercing rays no sooner reached his sight ,</l>

     <l n="33">Not easy ‘ twas her favours to procure ;</l>
     <l n="34">Rome was the place where dwelled this belle impure ;</l>
     <l n="35">The mitre and the cross with her were naught ;</l>

     <l n="37">And those who were not of the highest class ,</l>
     <l n="38">No moments were allowed with her to pass .</l>
     <l n="39">A member of the conclave , first in rank ,</l>

     <l n="52">Soon in her bosom raised a furious storm ;</l>
     <l n="53">Camillus was the name this youth had got ;</l>

     <l n="57">And in her breast received the urchin 's dart ,</l>
     <l n="58">Than throbs , and trembling fears o'erwhelmed her heart .</l>
     <l n="59">The flame she durst declare no other way ,</l>

     <l n="61">Till then , nor shame nor aught could her retain ;</l>

     <l n="65">Camillus nothing of the kind supposed .</l>
     <l n="66">Though she incessantly by looks disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="67">That something unrevealed disturbed the soul ,</l>
     <l n="68">And o'er her mind had absolute control .</l>
     <l n="69">Whatever presents Constance might receive ,</l>
     <l n="70">Still pensive sighs her breast appeared to heave :</l>
     <l n="71">Her tints of beauty too , began to fail ,</l>

     <l n="33">Who bathed at ease within the gliding stream ;</l>
     <l n="34">The girl was brisk , and worthy of esteem ,</l>
     <l n="35">Her eyes were pleased ; the object gave delight ;</l>
     <l n="36">Not one defect could be produced in sight ;</l>
     <l n="37">Already , by the shepherdess adored ,</l>
     <l n="38">If with the belle to pleasing flights he 'd soared ,</l>
     <l n="39">The god of love had all they wished concealed</l>
     <l n="40">None better know what should not be revealed .</l>
     <l n="41">Anne nothing feared : the willows were her shade ,</l>
     <l n="42">Which , like Venetian blinds , a cov'ring made ;</l>

     <l n="45">SHE back four paces drew , at first , through shame ;</l>

     <l n="48">And nearly ey'ry thing had truly spoiled .</l>
     <l n="49">Anne had a conscience pure as holy fire ;</l>
     <l n="50">But how could she abstain from soft desire ?</l>
     <l n="51">If , in the bosom chance a flame should raise ,</l>
     <l n="52">Is there a pow'r can then subdue the blaze ?</l>
     <l n="53">At first these inclinations she withstood ;</l>
     <l n="54">But doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood</l>
     <l n="55">Could sins commit by stepping in advance ,</l>
     <l n="56">She took her seat upon the green expanse ,</l>
     <l n="57">And there attentively the lad observed ,</l>

     <l n="100">The father-confessors , who there abound ,</l>
     <l n="101">As in our own , ( perhaps in ev'ry part ,)</l>

     <l n="105">THIS tribute to discharge the current year ,</l>

     <l n="112">A tap upon the shoulder care appeased ;</l>
     <l n="113">And with a smile he to the bringer said</l>
     <l n="114">This fish , with trifles on the table spread ,</l>
     <l n="115">Will all complete ; ‘ twas holyday we find ,</l>
     <l n="116">When other clergy with our rector dined .</l>
     <l n="117">Will you still more oblige , the parson cried ,</l>
     <l n="118">And let the fish at home by you be fried ?</l>
     <l n="119">Then bring it here :— my servant 's very new ,</l>
     <l n="120">And can n't attempt to cook as well as you .</l>
     <l n="121">Anne hastened back ; meanwhile the priests arrived ,</l>
     <l n="122">Much noise , and rout of course , once these were hived ;</l>
     <l n="123">Wines from the vault were brought without delay ;</l>

     <l n="125">THE dinner served ; the dean at table placed ;</l>
     <l n="126">Their conversation various points embraced ;</l>

     <l n="128">In this no doubt the reader will agree .</l>
     <l n="129">They changed and changed , and healths went round and round ;</l>
     <l n="130">No time for scandal while such cheer was found ;</l>
     <l n="131">The first and second course away were cleared ,</l>
     <l n="132">Dessert served up , yet still no pike appeared .</l>

     <l n="135">When William learned the present Anne had made ,</l>
     <l n="136">His wish , to have it cancelled , with her weighed .</l>
     <l n="137">The rector was surprised , you may suppose ,</l>
     <l n="138">And , soon as from the table all arose ,</l>
     <l n="139">He went to Anne , and called her fool and knave ,</l>
     <l n="140">And , in his wrath , could scarcely secrets wave ,</l>
     <l n="141">But nearly her reproached the bathing scene ;</l>

     <l n="3">True sleep for them alone it seems was made</l>
     <l n="4">With US the copy only has been laid ;</l>
     <l n="5">And by Saint John , if Heav'n my life will spare ,</l>
     <l n="6">I 'll see this place where sleeping ‘ s free from care .</l>
     <l n="7">E'en better still I find , for naught they do :</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis that employment always I pursue .</l>
     <l n="9">Just add thereto a little honest love ,</l>

     <l n="11">ON t'other hand an island may be seen ,</l>

     <l n="13">We know them by the thinness of their face</l>
     <l n="14">Long sleep is quite excluded from their race .</l>

     <l n="17">The form not clumsy , you may safely say ,</l>
     <l n="18">A Papimanian doubtless I survey .</l>
     <l n="19">But if , on t'other side , you chance to view ,</l>
     <l n="20">A meagre figure , void of blooming hue ,</l>
     <l n="21">With stupid , heavy eye , and gloomy mien</l>
     <l n="22">Conclude at once a Pope-figir , you 've seen .</l>

     <l n="23">POPE-FIG ‘ S the name upon an isle bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="24">Where once a fig the silly people showed ,</l>
     <l n="25">As like the pope , and due devotion paid :—</l>
     <l n="26">By folly , blocks have often gods been made !</l>
     <l n="27">These islanders were punished for their crime ;</l>
     <l n="28">Naught prospers , Francis tells us , in their clime ;</l>
     <l n="29">To Lucifer was giv'n the hateful spot ,</l>
     <l n="30">And there his country house he now has got .</l>
     <l n="31">His underlings appear throughout the isle ,</l>
     <l n="32">Rude , wretched , poor , mean , sordid , base , and vile ;</l>
     <l n="33">With tales , and horns , and claws , if we believe ,</l>
     <l n="34">What many say who ought not to deceive .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">ONE day it happened that a cunning clown</l>
     <l n="36">Was by an imp observed , without the town ,</l>
     <l n="37">To turn the earth , which seemed to be accurst ,</l>
     <l n="38">Since ev'ry trench was painful as the first .</l>
     <l n="39">This youthful devil was a titled lord ;</l>
     <l n="40">In manners simple :— naught to be abhorred ;</l>
     <l n="41">He might , so ignorant , be duped at ease ;</l>
     <l n="42">As yet he 'd scarcely ventured to displease :</l>
     <l n="43">Said he , I 'd have thee know , I was not born ,</l>
     <l n="44">Like clods to labour , dig nor sow the corn ;</l>
     <l n="45">A devil thou in me beholdest here ,</l>
     <l n="46">Of noble race : to toil I ne'er appear .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="47">THOU know'st full well , these fields to us belong :</l>
     <l n="48">The islanders , it seems , had acted wrong ;</l>
     <l n="49">And , for their crimes , the pope withdrew his cares ;</l>
     <l n="50">Our subjects now you live , the law declares ;</l>
     <l n="51">And therefore , fellow , I 've undoubted right ,</l>
     <l n="52">To take the produce of this field , at sight ;</l>
     <l n="53">But I am kind , and clearly will decide</l>
     <l n="54">The year concluded , we 'll the fruits divided .</l>
     <l n="55">What crop , pray tell me , dost thou mean to sow ?</l>
     <l n="56">The clod replied , my lord , what best will grow</l>
     <l n="57">I think is Tousell ; grain of hardy fame ;</l>
     <l n="58">The imp rejoined , I never heard its name ;</l>
     <l n="59">What is it . Tousell , say'st thou ?— I agree ,</l>
     <l n="60">If good return , ‘ twill be the same to me ;</l>
     <l n="61">Work fellow , work ; make haste , the ground prepare ;</l>
     <l n="62">To dig and delve should be the rabble 's care ;</l>
     <l n="63">Do n't think that I will ever lend a hand ,</l>
     <l n="64">Or give the slightest aid to till the land ;</l>
     <l n="65">I 've told thee I 'm a gentleman by birth ,</l>
     <l n="66">Designed for ease : not doomed to turn the earth .</l>
     <l n="67">Howe'er I 'll now the diff'rent parts allot ,</l>
     <l n="68">And thus divide the produce of the plot :—</l>
     <l n="69">What shall above the heritage arise ,</l>
     <l n="70">I 'll leave to thee ; ‘ twill very well suffice ;</l>
     <l n="71">But what is in the soil shall be my share ;</l>

     <l n="73">THIS beardless corn when ripe , with joy was reaped ,</l>
     <l n="74">And then the stubble by the roots was heaped ,</l>
     <l n="75">To satisfy the lordly devil 's claim ,</l>
     <l n="76">Who thought the seed and root were just the same ,</l>
     <l n="77">And that the ear and stalk were useless parts ,</l>
     <l n="78">Which nothing made if carried to the marts :</l>
     <l n="79">The labourer his produce housed with care ;</l>
     <l n="80">The other to the market brought his ware ,</l>
     <l n="81">Where ridicule and laughter he received ;</l>

     <l n="83">QUITE mortified , the devil quickly went ;</l>

     <l n="85">The fellow had discreetly sold the corn ,</l>
     <l n="86">In straw , unthrashed , and off the money borne ,</l>
     <l n="87">Which he , with ev'ry wily care , concealed ;</l>

     <l n="90">It seems that cheating is thy daily trade ;</l>
     <l n="91">But I 'm a noble devil of the court ,</l>
     <l n="92">Who tricking never knew , save by report .</l>
     <l n="93">What grain dost mean to sow th ’ ensuing year ?</l>
     <l n="94">The labourer replied , I think it clear ,</l>
     <l n="95">Instead of grain , ‘ twill better be to chop ,</l>
     <l n="96">And take a carrot , or a turnip crop ;</l>
     <l n="97">You then , my lord , will surely plenty find ;</l>
     <l n="98">And radishes , if you are so inclined .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="99">THESE carrots , radishes , and turnips too ,</l>
     <l n="100">Said t'other , I am led to think will do ;</l>
     <l n="101">My part shall be what ‘ bove the soil is found :</l>
     <l n="102">Thine , fellow , what remains within the ground ;</l>
     <l n="103">No war with thee I 'll have , unless constrained ,</l>
     <l n="104">And thou hast never yet of me complained .</l>
     <l n="105">I now shall go and try to tempt a nun ,</l>

     <l n="107">THE time arrived again to house the store ;</l>

     <l n="112">And ev'ry one around his jest preferred :—</l>

     <l n="119">By all the pow'rs of Hell , the demon cried ,</l>

     <l n="4">His vassal , Gyges , had from him a bait ,</l>

     <l n="11">Some day I 'll let you gratify your eyes ;</l>

     <l n="16">And not your mind with silly wishes feed ;</l>
     <l n="17">No sort of pleasure surely I could take ,</l>

     <l n="35">Exaggeration was the better part ,</l>
     <l n="36">And from the subject he would never start ,</l>

     <l n="1">A CERTAIN pious rector ( John his name ) ,</l>

     <l n="8">So fully know , there 's naught for me to say :</l>
     <l n="9">John to the senses things so clearly brought ,</l>
     <l n="10">That much by wives and husbands he was sought ,</l>
     <l n="11">Who held his knowledge of superior price ,</l>
     <l n="12">And paid attention to his sage advice .</l>
     <l n="13">Around , whatever conscience he might find ,</l>
     <l n="14">To soft delights and easy ways inclined ,</l>

     <l n="17">Not e'en his curate would he trust with these ;</l>
     <l n="18">But zealously he tried to give them ease ,</l>
     <l n="19">And ev'ry where would due attention show ,</l>
     <l n="20">Observing that divines should always know</l>

     <l n="26">Had furnished only with a pair of hands ,</l>
     <l n="27">To dig and delve , and by the mattock gain</l>
     <l n="28">Enough his wife and children to maintain .</l>
     <l n="29">Still youthful charms you in his spouse might trace ;</l>

     <l n="4">My Muse the veil howe'er is still inclined ,</l>

     <l n="6">And , ‘ mong the sisters , scene and scene pursue .</l>
     <l n="7">Is this too much ?— the nicest tricks they play ;</l>
     <l n="8">Through soft amours oft artfully they stray ,</l>
     <l n="9">And these in full I 'd readily detail ,</l>
     <l n="10">If I were sure the subject would not fail ;</l>
     <l n="11">And that 's impossible I must admit ,</l>

     <l n="18">So oft I 've overrun the convent-den ,</l>
     <l n="19">Like one who always makes , from time to time ,</l>

     <l n="23">IN former times was introduced a lad</l>
     <l n="24">Among the nuns , and like a maiden clad ;</l>
     <l n="25">A charming girl by all he was believed ;</l>
     <l n="26">Fifteen his age ; no doubts were then conceived ;</l>
     <l n="27">Coletta was the name the youth had brought ,</l>
     <l n="28">And , till he got a beard , was sister thought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">THE period howsoe'er was well employed ,</l>
     <l n="30">And from it Agnes profit had enjoyed ;</l>
     <l n="31">What profit ?— truly better had I said ,</l>
     <l n="32">That sister Agnes by him was misled ,</l>
     <l n="33">And store of ills received ; misfortune dire</l>
     <l n="34">Obliged the nun more girdle to require ,</l>
     <l n="35">And ultimately to produce ( in spite</l>
     <l n="36">Of ev'ry wish to guard the fact from light )</l>
     <l n="37">A little creature that our hist'ries say ,</l>
     <l n="38">Was found Coletta 's features to display .</l>

     <l n="39">GREAT scandal quickly through the convent ran :</l>
     <l n="40">How could this child arrive ?— the sisters ‘ gan</l>
     <l n="41">To laugh and ask , if in an evil hour ,</l>
     <l n="42">The mushroom could have fallen with a show'r ?</l>
     <l n="43">Or self-created was it not supposed ?</l>
     <l n="44">Much rage the abbess presently disclosed ;</l>
     <l n="45">To have her holy mansion thus disgraced !</l>
     <l n="46">Forthwith the culprit was in prison placed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">THE father to discover next they tried ;</l>
     <l n="48">How could he enter , pass , escape , or hide ;</l>
     <l n="49">The walls were high ; the grate was double too ;</l>
     <l n="50">Quite small the turning-box appeared to view ,</l>
     <l n="51">And she who managed it was very old :—</l>
     <l n="52">Perhaps some youthful spark has been so bold ,</l>
     <l n="53">Cried she who was superior to the rest ,</l>
     <l n="54">To get admitted , like a maiden dressed ,</l>
     <l n="55">And ‘ mong our flock ( if rightly I surmise )</l>
     <l n="56">A wicked wolf is lurking in disguise .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="59">THE lad disguised was terrified to death ;</l>
     <l n="60">Each plan was dissipated with a breath ;</l>
     <l n="61">The more he thought of means from thence to get ,</l>
     <l n="62">The greater were the obstacles he met .</l>
     <l n="63">At length NECESSITY ( the parent found</l>
     <l n="64">Of stratagems and wiles , so much renowned ,)</l>
     <l n="65">Induced the youth . . . ( I scarcely can proceed )</l>
     <l n="66">To tie . . . expression here I clearly need ;</l>
     <l n="67">What word will decently express the thought ?</l>
     <l n="68">What book has got it ?— where should it be sought ?</l>
     <l n="69">You 've heard , in days of yore that human kind ,</l>
     <l n="70">With windows in their bosoms were designed ,</l>
     <l n="71">Through which ‘ twas easy all within to see ,</l>
     <l n="72">And suited those of medical degree .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="73">BUT if these windows useful were believed ;</l>
     <l n="74">‘ Twas inconvenient in the heart perceived ,</l>
     <l n="75">And women thoroughly disliked the scheme :—</l>
     <l n="76">They could not find the means to hide a dream .</l>
     <l n="77">Dame Nature howsoe'er contrived a plan :—</l>
     <l n="78">One lace she gave the woman , one the man ,</l>
     <l n="79">Of equal length , and each enough no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="80">By proper care to shut the ope throughout .</l>
     <l n="81">The woman much too thick her eyelets placed ;</l>
     <l n="82">And consequently , ne'er was closely laced ;</l>
     <l n="83">The fault was all her own : herself the cause ;</l>
     <l n="84">The man as little merited applause ,</l>
     <l n="85">For coarsely working , soon the hole was shut ,</l>
     <l n="86">From which the remnant lace was left to jut ;</l>
     <l n="87">In fact , on either side , whate'er was done ,</l>
     <l n="88">The laces never equally would run ,</l>
     <l n="89">And we are told , both sexes acted wrong :</l>
     <l n="90">The woman 's was too short ; the man 's too long .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="91">FROM this ‘ tis easy , it should seem to guess :</l>
     <l n="92">What by the youth was tied in this distress</l>
     <l n="93">The end of lace that by the men was left ,</l>
     <l n="94">When nature ordered them to close the cleft :</l>
     <l n="95">With thread he fastened it so very well ,</l>
     <l n="96">That all was flat as any nun or belle ;</l>
     <l n="97">But thread or silk , you cannot find a string</l>
     <l n="98">To hold , what soon I fear will give a spring ,</l>
     <l n="99">And get away , in spite of all you do ;</l>
     <l n="100">Bring saints or angels such a scene to view ,</l>
     <l n="101">As twenty nuns in similar array ,</l>
     <l n="102">Strange creatures I should think them :— merely clay ,</l>
     <l n="103">If they should at the sight unmoved remain ;</l>
     <l n="104">I speak of nuns , howe'er , whose charms maintain</l>
     <l n="105">Superior rank , and like the Graces seem ,</l>

     <l n="113">The nice proportions and the lily charms</l>
     <l n="114">Soon raised within his bosom dire alarms ;</l>

     <l n="116">And from it , what was tied , soon gave a spring ;</l>
     <l n="117">Broke loose at once , just like a mettled steed ,</l>

     <l n="125">A chapter instantly the lady held ;</l>
     <l n="126">Long time upon the circumstance they dwelled .</l>
     <l n="127">The youthful wolf that caused the direful shock ;</l>
     <l n="128">At length was given to the aged flock ,</l>

     <l n="138">The nuns of tender hearts and youthful bloom :—</l>
     <l n="139">By chance , a friend to sly gallants appeared ,</l>
     <l n="140">And soon removed , what most our hero feared :</l>
     <l n="141">A miller mounted on his mule came by ,</l>
     <l n="142">A tight-built active lad with piercing eye ;</l>

     <l n="146">Young man , pray tell me who has placed thee there ?</l>
     <l n="147">The sisters , say'st thou ?— hast thou had thy fun ,</l>
     <l n="148">And pleased thy fancy with a wanton nun ?</l>
     <l n="149">Art satisfied ?— and was she pretty too ?</l>
     <l n="150">In truth , to judge by what appears to view ,</l>
     <l n="151">Thou seemest thoroughly a wily wight ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="153">ALAS ! replied the other with a sigh ,</l>

     <l n="160">To counteract , and prove to pleasure blind ?</l>
     <l n="161">The business clearly should to me belong ;</l>
     <l n="162">Our rector ne'er had thought such conduct wrong ,</l>
     <l n="163">And never would have played the fool like this ;</l>
     <l n="164">Fly , haste away , away ; I 'll thee dismiss ,</l>
     <l n="165">First having nicely set me in thy place ;</l>

     <l n="170">Should happen any way the string to break .</l>
     <l n="171">The other never asked his wishes twice ,</l>

     <l n="183">Deceived you are ; regard me well I pray ;</l>

     <l n="16">Kept house , and through some difficulties ran .</l>

     <l n="135">THE friends disputed which the lead should take ,</l>

     <l n="138">Such compliments were out of fashion now .</l>
     <l n="139">To settle this , at length three dice they took ;</l>

     <l n="144">The mistress , softly treading ‘ mid the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="145">The necessary signal gently gave ,</l>
     <l n="146">On which she entered presently the cave ,</l>

     <l n="153">The lucky wight more pleasure would have felt ,</l>

     <l n="61">That , fearful she might be beguiled ,</l>
     <l n="62">She would not let her out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="63">A single minute , day or night .</l>
     <l n="64">At mother 's apron string all day</l>
     <l n="65">Kate whiled the weary hours away ,</l>
     <l n="66">And shared her bed all night . Such love</l>
     <l n="67">In parents we must all approve ,</l>
     <l n="68">Though Catherine , I must confess ,</l>
     <l n="69">In place of so much tenderness</l>
     <l n="70">More liberty would have preferred .</l>
     <l n="71">To little girls maternal care</l>
     <l n="72">In such excess is right and fair ,</l>
     <l n="73">But for a lass of fourteen years ,</l>
     <l n="74">For whom one need have no such fears ,</l>
     <l n="75">Solicitude is quite absurd ,</l>
     <l n="76">And only bores her . Kitty could</l>
     <l n="77">No moment steal , do what she would ,</l>
     <l n="78">To see her Richard . Sorely vexed</l>
     <l n="79">She was , and he still more perplexed .</l>
     <l n="80">In spite of all he might devise</l>
     <l n="81">A squeeze , a kiss , quick talk of eyes</l>
     <l n="82">Was all he could obtain , no more .</l>
     <l n="83">Bread butterless , a sanded floor ,</l>
     <l n="84">It seemed no better . Joy like this</l>
     <l n="85">Could not suffice , more sterling bliss</l>
     <l n="86">Our lovers wished , nor would stop short</l>
     <l n="87">Till they 'd obtained the thing they sought .</l>
     <l n="88">And thus it came about . One day</l>
     <l n="89">By chance they met , alone , away</l>
     <l n="90">From jealous parents . “ What 's the use ; ”</l>
     <l n="91">Said Richard , “ of all our affection ?</l>
     <l n="92">“ Of love it is a rank abuse ,</l>
     <l n="93">“ And yields me nothing but dejection</l>
     <l n="94">“ I see you without seeing you ,</l>
     <l n="95">“ Must always look another way ,</l>
     <l n="96">“ And if we meet I dare not stay ,</l>
     <l n="97">“ Must ev'ry inclination smother .</l>
     <l n="98">“ I can n't believe your love is true ;</l>
     <l n="99">“ I 'll never own you really kind</l>
     <l n="100">“ Unless some certain means you find</l>
     <l n="101">“ For us to meet without your mother . ”</l>
     <l n="102">Kate answered : “ Were it not too plain</l>
     <l n="103">“ How warm my love , another strain</l>
     <l n="104">“ I would employ . In converse vain</l>
     <l n="105">“ Let us not waste our moments few ;</l>
     <l n="106">“ But think what it were best to do . ”</l>
     <l n="107">“ If you will please me , ” Robert said ,</l>
     <l n="108">“ You must contrive to change your bed ,</l>
     <l n="109">“ And have it placed — well , let me see —</l>
     <l n="110">“ Moved to the outer gallery ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ Where you will be alone and free .</l>
     <l n="112">“ We there can meet and chat at leisure</l>
     <l n="113">“ While others sleep , nor need we fear ,</l>
     <l n="114">“ Of merry tales I have a treasure</l>
     <l n="115">“ To tell , but cannot tell them here . ”</l>
     <l n="116">Kate smiled at this for she knew well</l>
     <l n="117">What sort of tales he had to tell ;</l>
     <l n="118">But promised she would do her best</l>
     <l n="119">And soon accomplish his request .</l>
     <l n="120">It was not easy , you 'll admit ,</l>
     <l n="121">But love lends foolish maidens wit ;</l>
     <l n="122">And this is how she managed it .</l>
     <l n="123">The whole night long she kept awake ,</l>
     <l n="124">Snored , sighed and kicked , as one possessed ,</l>
     <l n="125">That parents both could get not rest ,</l>
     <l n="126">So much she made the settle shake .</l>
     <l n="127">This is not strange . A longing girl ,</l>
     <l n="128">With thoughts of sweetheart in her head ,</l>
     <l n="129">In bed all night will sleepless twirl .</l>
     <l n="130">A flea is in her ear , ‘ tis said .</l>
     <l n="131">The morning broke . Of fleas and heat</l>
     <l n="132">Kitty complained . “ Let me entreat ,</l>
     <l n="133">“ O mother , I may put my bed</l>
     <l n="134">“ Out in the gallery , ” she said ,</l>
     <l n="135">“ ‘ Tis cooler there , and Philomel</l>
     <l n="136">“ Who warbles in the neigh'bring dell</l>
     <l n="137">“ Will solace me . ” Ready consent</l>
     <l n="138">The simple mother gave , and went</l>
     <l n="139">To seek her spouse . “ Our Kate , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="140">“ Will change her bed that she may hear</l>
     <l n="141">“ The nightingale , and sleep more cool . ”</l>
     <l n="142">“ Wife , ” said the good man , “ You 're a fool ,</l>
     <l n="143">“ And Kate too with her nightingale ;</l>
     <l n="144">“ Do n't tell me such a foolish tale .</l>
     <l n="145">“ She must remain . No doubt to-night</l>
     <l n="146">“ Will fresher be . I sleep all right</l>
     <l n="147">“ In spite of heat , and so can she .</l>
     <l n="148">“ Is she more delicate than me ? ”</l>
     <l n="149">Incensed was Kate by this denial</l>
     <l n="150">After so promising a trial ,</l>
     <l n="151">Nor would be beat , but firmly swore</l>
     <l n="152">To give more trouble than before .</l>
     <l n="153">That night again no wink she slept</l>
     <l n="154">But groaned and fretted , sighed and wept ,</l>
     <l n="155">Upon her couch so tossed and turned ,</l>
     <l n="156">The anxious mother quite concerned</l>
     <l n="157">Again her husband sought . “ Our Kate</l>
     <l n="158">“ To me seems greatly changed of late .</l>
     <l n="159">“ You are unkind , ” she said to him ,</l>
     <l n="160">“ To thwart her simple , girlish whim .</l>
     <l n="161">“ Why may she not her bed exchange ,</l>
     <l n="162">“ In naught will it the house derange ?</l>
     <l n="163">“ Placed in the passage she 's as near</l>
     <l n="164">“ To us as were she lying here .</l>
     <l n="165">“ You do not love your child , and will</l>
     <l n="166">“ With your unkindness make her ill . ”</l>
     <l n="167">“ Pray cease , ” the husband cried , “ to scold</l>
     <l n="168">“ And take your whim . I ne'er could hold</l>
     <l n="169">“ My own against a screaming wife ;</l>
     <l n="170">“ You 'll drive me mad , upon my life .</l>
     <l n="171">“ Her belly-full our Kate may get</l>
     <l n="172">“ Of nightingale or of linnet . ”</l>
     <l n="173">The thing was settled . Kate obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="174">And in a trice her bed was made ,</l>
     <l n="175">And lover signalled . Who shall say</l>
     <l n="176">How long to both appeared that day ,</l>
     <l n="177">That tedious day ! But night arrived</l>
     <l n="178">And Richard too ; he had contrived</l>
     <l n="179">By ladder , and a servant 's aid ,</l>
     <l n="180">To reach the chamber of the maid .</l>
     <l n="181">To tell how often they embraced ,</l>
     <l n="182">How changed in form their tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="183">Would lead to nothing but a waste</l>
     <l n="184">Of time , my readers will confess .</l>
     <l n="185">The longest , most abstruse discourse</l>
     <l n="186">Would lack precision , want the force</l>
     <l n="187">Their youthful ardour to portray .</l>
     <l n="188">To understand there 's but one way —</l>
     <l n="189">Experience . The nightingale</l>
     <l n="190">Sang all night long his pleasing tale ,</l>
     <l n="191">And though he made but little noise ,</l>
     <l n="192">The lass was satisfied . Her joys</l>
     <l n="193">So exquisite that she averred</l>
     <l n="194">The other nightingale , the bird</l>
     <l n="195">Who warbles to the woods his bliss ,</l>
     <l n="196">Was but an ass compared with this .</l>
     <l n="197">But nature could not long maintain</l>
     <l n="198">Of efforts such as these the strain ;</l>
     <l n="199">Their forces spent , the lovers twain</l>
     <l n="200">In fond embrace fell fast asleep</l>
     <l n="201">Just as the dawn began to peep :</l>
     <l n="202">The father as he left his bed</l>
     <l n="203">By curiosity was led</l>
     <l n="204">To learn if Kitty soundly slept ,</l>
     <l n="205">And softly to the passage crept .</l>
     <l n="206">“ I 'll see the influence , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="207">“ Of nightingale and change of bed . ”</l>
     <l n="208">With bated breath , upon tip toes ,</l>
     <l n="209">Close to the couch he cautious goes</l>
     <l n="210">Where Kitty lay in calm repose .</l>
     <l n="211">Excessive heat had made all clothes</l>
     <l n="212">Unbearable . The sleeping pair</l>
     <l n="213">Had cast them off , and lay as bare</l>
     <l n="214">As our first happy parents were</l>
     <l n="215">In Paradise . But in the place</l>
     <l n="216">Of apple , in her willing hand</l>
     <l n="217">Kate firmly grasp the magic wand</l>
     <l n="218">Which served to found the human race ,</l>
     <l n="219">The which to name were a disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="220">Though dames the most refined employ it ;</l>
     <l n="221">Desire it , and much enjoy it ,</l>
     <l n="222">If good Catullus tells us true .</l>
     <l n="223">The father scarce believed his view ,</l>
     <l n="224">But keeping in his bosom pent</l>
     <l n="225">His anger , to his wife he went ,</l>
     <l n="226">And said , “ Get up , and come with me .</l>
     <l n="227">“ At present I can plainly see</l>
     <l n="228">“ Why Kate had such anxiety</l>
     <l n="229">“ To hear the nightingale , for she</l>
     <l n="230">“ To catch the bird so well has planned</l>
     <l n="231">“ That now she holds him in her hand . ”</l>
     <l n="232">The mother almost wept for glee .</l>
     <l n="233">“ A nightingale , oh ! let me see .</l>
     <l n="234">“ How large is he , and can he sing ,</l>
     <l n="235">“ And will he breed , the pretty thing ?</l>
     <l n="236">“ How did she catch him , clever child ? ”</l>
     <l n="237">Despite his grief the good man smiled .</l>
     <l n="238">“ Much more than you expect you 'll see .</l>
     <l n="239">“ But hold your tongue , and come with me ;</l>
     <l n="240">“ For if your chattering is heard ,</l>
     <l n="241">“ Away will fly the timid bird ;</l>
     <l n="242">“ And you will spoil our daughter 's game . ”</l>
     <l n="243">Who was surprised ? It was the dame .</l>
     <l n="244">Her anger burst into a flame</l>
     <l n="245">As she the nightingale espied</l>
     <l n="246">Which Kitty held ; she could have cried ,</l>
     <l n="247">And scolded , called her nasty slut ,</l>
     <l n="248">And brazen hussey , bitch , and — but</l>
     <l n="249">Her husband stopped her . “ What 's the use</l>
     <l n="250">“ Of all your scolding and abuse ?</l>
     <l n="251">“ The mischief 's done , in vain may you</l>
     <l n="252">“ From now till doomsday fret and stew ,</l>
     <l n="253">“ Misfortune done you can n't undo ,</l>
     <l n="254">“ But something may be done to mend :</l>
     <l n="255">“ For notary this instant send ,</l>
     <l n="256">“ Bid holy priest and mayor attend .</l>
     <l n="257">“ For their good offices I wait</l>
     <l n="258">“ To set this nasty matter straight . ”</l>
     <l n="259">As he discoursed , Richard awoke ,</l>
     <l n="260">And seeing that the sun had broke ,</l>
     <l n="261">These troubled words to Kitty spoke</l>
     <l n="262">“ Alas , my love , ‘ tis broad day light ,</l>
     <l n="263">“ How can I now effect my flight ? ”</l>
     <l n="264">“ All will go well , ” rejoined the sire ,</l>
     <l n="265">“ I will not grumble , my just ire</l>
     <l n="266">“ Were useless here ; you have committed</l>
     <l n="267">“ A wrong of which to be acquitted ,</l>
     <l n="268">“ Richard , there is one only way ,</l>
     <l n="269">“ My child you wed without delay .</l>
     <l n="270">“ She 's well brought up , young , full of health</l>
     <l n="271">“ If fortune has not granted wealth ,</l>
     <l n="272">“ Her beauty you do not deny ,</l>
     <l n="273">“ So wed her , or prepare to die . ”</l>
     <l n="274">To hesitate in such a case</l>
     <l n="275">Would surely have been out of place</l>
     <l n="276">The girl he loved to take to wife ,</l>
     <l n="277">Or in his prime to lose his life ,</l>
     <l n="278">The point in truth needs no debate ,</l>
     <l n="279">Nor did our Richard hesitate .</l>
     <l n="280">Besides , the most supreme delight</l>
     <l n="281">Of life he 'd tasted one short night ,</l>
     <l n="282">But one , in lovely Kitty 's arms ;</l>
     <l n="283">Could he so soon resign her charms !</l>
     <l n="284">While Richard , pleased with his escape</l>
     <l n="285">From what he feared an awkward scrape ,</l>
     <l n="286">Was dreaming of his happy choice ,</l>
     <l n="287">Our Kitty , by her father 's voice</l>
     <l n="288">Awakened , from her hand let go</l>
     <l n="289">The cause of all her joy and woe ,</l>
     <l n="290">And round her naked beauties wound</l>
     <l n="291">The sheet picked up from off the ground :</l>
     <l n="292">Meanwhile the notary appears</l>
     <l n="293">To put an end to all their fears .</l>
     <l n="294">They wrote , they signed , the sealed — and thus</l>
     <l n="295">The wedding ended free from fuss .</l>
     <l n="296">They left the happy couple there .</l>
     <l n="297">His satisfaction to declare ,</l>
     <l n="298">Thus spoke their father to the pair :</l>
     <l n="299">“ Take courage , children , have no care ;</l>
     <l n="300">“ The nightingale in cage is pent ,</l>
