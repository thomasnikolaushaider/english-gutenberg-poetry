    <head>THE COUNTRYMAN WHO SOUGHT HIS CALF</head>
     <l n="1">A COUNTRYMAN , one day , his calf had lost ,</l>
     <l n="2">And , seeking it , a neighbouring forest crossed ;</l>
     <l n="3">The tallest tree that in the district grew ,</l>
     <l n="4">He climbed to get a more extensive view .</l>
     <l n="5">Just then a lady with her lover came ;</l>
     <l n="6">The place was pleasing , both to spark and dame ;</l>
     <l n="7">Their mutual wishes , looks and eyes expressed ,</l>
     <l n="8">And on the grass the lady was caressed .</l>
     <l n="9">At sights of charms , enchanting to the eyes ,</l>
     <l n="10">The gay gallant exclaimed , with fond surprise :—</l>
     <l n="11">Ye gods , what striking beauties now I see !</l>
     <l n="12">No objects named ; but spoke with anxious glee .</l>
     <l n="13">The clod , who , on the tree had mounted high ,</l>
     <l n="14">And heard at ease the conversation nigh ,</l>
     <l n="15">Now cried :— Good man ! who see with such delight ;</l>
     <l n="16">Pray tell me if my calf be in your sight ?</l>

    <head>HANS CARVEL 'S RING</head>
     <l n="1">HANS CARVEL took , when weak and late in life ;</l>
     <l n="2">A girl , with youth and beauteous charms to wife ;</l>
     <l n="3">And with her , num'rous troubles , cares and fears ;</l>
     <l n="4">For , scarcely one without the rest appears .</l>
     <l n="5">Bab ( such her name , and daughter of a knight )</l>
     <l n="6">Was airy , buxom : formed for am'rous fight .</l>
     <l n="7">Hans , holding jeers and cuckoldom in dread ,</l>
     <l n="8">Would have his precious rib with caution tread ,</l>
     <l n="9">And nothing but the Bible e'er peruse ;</l>
     <l n="10">All other books he daily would abuse ;</l>
     <l n="11">Blamed secret visits ; frowned at loose attire ;</l>
     <l n="12">And censured ev'ry thing gallants admire .</l>
     <l n="13">The dame , howe'er , was deaf to all he said ;</l>
     <l n="14">No preaching pleased but what to pleasure led ,</l>
     <l n="15">Which made the aged husband hold his tongue .</l>
     <l n="16">And wish for death , since all round went wrong .</l>
     <l n="17">Some easy moments he perhaps might get ;</l>
     <l n="18">A full detail in hist'ry ' s page is met .</l>
     <l n="19">One night , when company he 'd had to dine ,</l>
     <l n="20">And pretty well was fill 'd with gen'rous wine ,</l>
     <l n="21">Hans dreamed , as near his wife he snoring lay ,</l>
     <l n="22">The devil came his compliments to pay ,</l>
     <l n="23">And having on his finger put a ring ,</l>
     <l n="24">Said he , friend Hans , I know thou feel'st a sting ;</l>
     <l n="25">Thy trouble ‘ s great : I pity much thy case ;</l>
     <l n="26">Let but this ring , howe'er , thy finger grace ,</l>
     <l n="27">And while ‘ tis there I 'll answer with my head ,</l>
     <l n="28">THAT ne'er shall happen which is now thy dread :</l>
     <l n="29">Hans , quite delighted , forced his finger through ;</l>
     <l n="30">You drunken beast , cried Bab , what would you do ?</l>
     <l n="31">To love 's devoirs quite lost , you take no care ,</l>
     <l n="32">And now have thrust your finger God knows where !</l>

    <head>THE HERMIT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHEN Venus and Hypocrisy combine ,</l>
     <l n="2">Oft pranks are played that show a deep design ;</l>
     <l n="3">Men are but men , and friars full as weak :</l>
     <l n="4">I 'm not by Envy moved these truths to speak .</l>
     <l n="5">Have you a sister , daughter , pretty wife ?</l>
     <l n="6">Beware the monks as you would guard your life ;</l>
     <l n="7">If in their snares a simple belle be caught :</l>
     <l n="8">The trap succeeds : to ruin she is brought .</l>
     <l n="9">To show that monks are knaves in Virtue 's mask ;</l>
     <l n="10">Pray read my tale :— no other proof I ask .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">A HERMIT , full of youth , was thought around ,</l>
     <l n="12">A saint , and worthy of the legend found .</l>
     <l n="13">The holy man a knotted cincture wore ;</l>
     <l n="14">But , ‘ neath his garb :— heart-rotten to the core .</l>
     <l n="15">A chaplet from his twisted girdle hung ,</l>
     <l n="16">Of size extreme , and regularly strung ,</l>
     <l n="17">On t'other side was worn a little bell ;</l>
     <l n="18">The hypocrite in ALL , he acted well ;</l>
     <l n="19">And if a female near his cell appeared ,</l>
     <l n="20">He 'd keep within as if the sex he feared ,</l>
     <l n="21">With downcast eyes and looks of woe complete ,</l>
     <l n="22">You 'd ne'er suppose that butter he could eat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">NOT far from where the hermit 's cell was placed ,</l>
     <l n="24">Within a village dwelled a widow chaste ;</l>
     <l n="25">Her residence was at the further end</l>
     <l n="26">And all her store — a daughter as a friend ,</l>
     <l n="27">Who candour , youth , and charms supreme possessed ;</l>
     <l n="28">And still a virgin lived , howe'er distressed .</l>
     <l n="29">Though if the real truth perhaps we name ,</l>
     <l n="30">‘ Twas more simplicity than virtuous aim ;</l>
     <l n="31">Not much of industry , but honest heart ;</l>
     <l n="32">No wealth , nor lovers , who might hope impart .</l>
     <l n="33">In Adam 's days , when all with clothes were born ,</l>
     <l n="34">She doubtless might like finery have worn ;</l>
     <l n="35">A house was furnished then without expense ;</l>
     <l n="36">For sheets or mattresses you 'd no pretence ;</l>
     <l n="37">Not e'en a bed was necessary thought</l>
     <l n="38">No blankets , pillowbiers , nor quilts were bought .</l>
     <l n="39">Those times are o'er ; then Hymen came alone ;</l>
     <l n="40">But now a lawyer in his train is shown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="41">OUR anchorite , in begging through the place ;</l>
     <l n="42">This girl beheld ,— but not with eyes of grace .</l>
     <l n="43">Said he , she 'll do , and , if thou manag'st right ,</l>
     <l n="44">Lucius , at times , with her to pass the night .</l>
     <l n="45">No time he lost , his wishes to secure :</l>
     <l n="46">The means , we may suppose , not over pure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">QUITE near the open fields they lived , I 've said ;</l>
     <l n="48">An humble , boarded cottage o'er their head .</l>
     <l n="49">One charming night — no , I mistake ‘ tis plain ,</l>
     <l n="50">Our hermit , favoured much by wind and rain ,</l>
     <l n="51">Pierced in the boarding , where by time ‘ twas worn ;</l>
     <l n="52">A hole through which he introduced a horn ;</l>
     <l n="53">And loudly bawled :— attend to what I say ,</l>
     <l n="54">Ye women , my commands at once obey .</l>
     <l n="55">This voice spread terror through the little cot ;</l>
     <l n="56">Both hid their heads and trembled for their lot ;</l>
     <l n="57">But still our monk his horn would sound aloud</l>
     <l n="58">Awake ! cried he ; your favour God has vowed ;</l>
     <l n="59">My faithful servant , Lucius , haste to seek ;</l>
     <l n="60">At early dawn go find this hermit meek</l>
     <l n="61">To no one say a word : ‘ tis Heav'n ordains ;</l>
     <l n="62">Fear nothing , Lucius ever blessed remains ;</l>
     <l n="63">I 'll show the way myself : your daughter place ,</l>
     <l n="64">Good widow , with this holy man of grace ;</l>
     <l n="65">And from their intercourse a pope shall spring ,</l>
     <l n="66">Who back to virtue christendom will bring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="67">HE spoke to them so very loud and clear ,</l>
     <l n="68">They heard , though ‘ neath the clothes half dead with fear .</l>
     <l n="69">Some time howe'er the females lay in dread ;</l>
     <l n="70">At length the daughter ventured out her head ,</l>
     <l n="71">And , pulling hastily her parent 's arm ,</l>
     <l n="72">Said she , dear mother , ( not suspecting harm )</l>
     <l n="73">Good Heav'ns ! must I obey and thither go ?</l>
     <l n="74">What would the holy man on me bestow ?</l>
     <l n="75">I know not what to say nor how to act ;</l>
     <l n="76">Now cousin Anne would with him be exact ,</l>
     <l n="77">And better recollect his sage advice :—</l>
     <l n="78">Fool ! said the mother , never be so nice ;</l>
     <l n="79">Go , nothing fear , and do whate'er ' s desired ;</l>
     <l n="80">Much understanding will not be required ;</l>
     <l n="81">The first or second time thou'lt get thy cue ,</l>
     <l n="82">And cousin Anne will less know what to do .</l>
     <l n="83">Indeed ? the girl replied ; well , let 's away ,</l>
     <l n="84">And we 'll return to bed without delay .</l>
     <l n="85">But softly , cried the mother with a smile ;</l>
     <l n="86">Not quite so fast , for Satan may beguile ;</l>
     <l n="87">And if ‘ twere so , hast taken proper care ?</l>
     <l n="88">I think he spoke like one who would ensnare .</l>
     <l n="89">To be precipitate , in such a case ,</l>
     <l n="90">Perhaps might lead at once to dire disgrace .</l>
     <l n="91">If thou wert terrified and did'st not hear ,</l>
     <l n="92">Myself I 'm sure was quite o'ercome with fear .</l>
     <l n="93">No , no , rejoined the daughter , I am right :</l>
     <l n="94">I clearly heard , dear mother , spite of fright .</l>
     <l n="95">Well then , replied the widow , let us pray ,</l>
     <l n="96">That we by Satan be not led astray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="97">AT length they both arose when morning came ,</l>
     <l n="98">And through the day the converse was the same .</l>
     <l n="99">At night howe'er the horn was heard once more ,</l>
     <l n="100">And terrified the females as before .</l>
     <l n="101">Thou unbelieving woman , cried the voice ,</l>
     <l n="102">For certain purposes of God the choice ;</l>
     <l n="103">No more delay , but to the hermit fly ,</l>
     <l n="104">Or ‘ tis decreed that thou shalt quickly die .</l>
     <l n="105">Now , mother , said the girl , I told you well ;</l>
     <l n="106">Come , let us hasten to the hermit 's cell ;</l>
     <l n="107">So much I dread your death , I 'll nothing shun ;</l>
     <l n="108">And if ‘ tis requisite , I 'll even run .</l>
     <l n="109">Away then , cried the mother , let us go ;</l>
     <l n="110">Some pains to dress , the daughter would bestow ,</l>
     <l n="111">Without reflecting what might be her fare :—</l>
     <l n="112">To PLEASE is ev'ry blooming lass 's care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="113">OUR monk was on the watch you may suppose ;</l>
     <l n="114">A hole he made that would a glimpse disclose ;</l>
     <l n="115">By which , when near his cell the females drew ,</l>
     <l n="116">They might , with whip in hand the hermit view ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who , like a culprit punished for his crimes ,</l>
     <l n="118">Received the lash , and that so many times ,</l>
     <l n="119">It sounded like the discipline of schools ,</l>
     <l n="120">And made more noise than flogging fifty fools .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="121">WHEN first our pilgrims knocked , he would not hear ;</l>
     <l n="122">And , for the moment , whipping would appear ;</l>
     <l n="123">The holy lash severely he applied ,</l>
     <l n="124">Which , through the hole , with pain our females spied ;</l>
     <l n="125">At length the door he ope 'd , but from his eyes</l>
     <l n="126">No satisfaction beamed : he showed surprise .</l>
     <l n="127">With trembling knees and blushes o'er the face ,</l>
     <l n="128">The widow now explained the mystick case .</l>
     <l n="129">Six steps behind , the beauteous daughter stood ,</l>
     <l n="130">And waited the decree she thought so good .</l>
     <l n="131">The hypocrite howe'er the hermit played ,</l>
     <l n="132">And sent these humble pilgrims back dismayed .</l>
     <l n="133">Said he , the evil spirit much I dread ;</l>
     <l n="134">No female to my cell should e'er be led ;</l>
     <l n="135">Excuse me then : such acts would sorrow bring ;</l>
     <l n="136">From me the HOLY FATHER ne'er spring .</l>
     <l n="137">What ne'er from you ? the widow straight replied :</l>
     <l n="138">And why should not the blessing , pray , be tried ?</l>
     <l n="139">No other answer howsoe'er she got ;</l>
     <l n="140">So back they trudged once more to gain their cot .</l>
     <l n="141">Ah ! mother , said the girl , ‘ tis my belief ,</l>
     <l n="142">Our many heavy sins have caused thus grief .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="143">WHEN night arrived and they in sleep were lost ,</l>
     <l n="144">Again the hermit 's horn the woodwork crossed ;</l>
     <l n="145">Return , return , cried he with horrid tone ;</l>
     <l n="146">To-morrow you 'll have due attention shown ;</l>
     <l n="147">I 've changed the hermit 's cold fastidious mind ,</l>
     <l n="148">And when you come , he 'll act as I 've designed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="149">THE couple left their bed at break of day ,</l>
     <l n="150">And to the cell repaired without delay</l>
     <l n="151">Our tale to shorten , Lucius kind appeared</l>
     <l n="152">To rigid rules no longer he adhered .</l>
     <l n="153">The mother with him let her girl remain ,</l>
     <l n="154">And hastened to her humble roof again .</l>
     <l n="155">The belle complying looked :— he took her arm ,</l>
     <l n="156">And soon familiar grew with ev'ry charm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="157">O HYPOCRITES ! how oft your wily art</l>
     <l n="158">Deceives the world and causes poignant smart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="159">AT matins they so very often met ,</l>
     <l n="160">Some awkward indications caused regret .</l>
     <l n="161">The fair at length her apron-string perceived</l>
     <l n="162">Grew daily shorter , which her bosom grieved ;</l>
     <l n="163">But nothing to the hermit she 'd unfold ,</l>
     <l n="164">Nor e'en those feelings to her mother told ;</l>
     <l n="165">She dreaded lest she should be sent away ,</l>
     <l n="166">And be deprived at once of Cupid 's play .</l>
     <l n="167">You 'll tell me whence so much discernment came ?</l>
     <l n="168">From this same play :— the tree of art by name .</l>
     <l n="169">For sev'n long months the nymph her visits paid ;</l>
     <l n="170">Her inexperience doubtless wanted aid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="171">BUT when the mother saw her daughter 's case ,</l>
     <l n="172">She made her thank the monk , and leave the place .</l>
     <l n="173">The hermit blessed the Lord for what was done ;</l>
     <l n="174">A pleasant course his humble slave had run .</l>
     <l n="175">He told the mother and her daughter fair ,</l>
     <l n="176">The child , by God 's permission , gifts would share .</l>
     <l n="177">Howe'er , be careful , said the wily wight ,</l>
     <l n="178">That with your infant ev'ry thing goes right ;</l>
     <l n="179">To you , from thence , great happiness will spring :</l>
     <l n="180">You 'll reign the parent of what 's more than king ;</l>
     <l n="181">Your relatives to noble rank will rise :</l>
     <l n="182">Some will be princes ; others lords comprise ;</l>
     <l n="183">Your nephews cardinals ; your cousins too</l>
     <l n="184">Will dukes become , if they the truth pursue ;</l>
     <l n="185">And places , castles , palaces , there 'll be ,</l>
     <l n="186">For you and them of every high degree ;</l>
     <l n="187">You 'll nothing want : eternal is the source ,</l>
     <l n="188">Like waters flowing in the river 's course .</l>
     <l n="189">This long prediction o'er : with features grave ,</l>
     <l n="190">His benediction to them both he gave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="191">WHEN home returned , the girl , each day and night ,</l>
     <l n="192">Amused her mind with prospects of delight ;</l>
     <l n="193">By fancy 's aid she saw the future pope ,</l>
     <l n="194">And all prepared to greet her fondest hope ;</l>
     <l n="195">But what arrived the whole at once o'erthrew</l>
     <l n="196">Hats , dukedoms , castles , vanished from the view :</l>
     <l n="197">The promised elevation of the NAME</l>
     <l n="198">Dissolved to air : - a little female came !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHEN Cupid with his dart , would hearts assail ,</l>
     <l n="2">The rampart most secure is not the VEIL ;</l>
     <l n="3">A husband better will the FAIR protect ,</l>
     <l n="4">Than walls or lattices , I much suspect .</l>
     <l n="5">Those parents , who in nunneries have got</l>
     <l n="6">Their daughters ( whether willingly or not ) ,</l>
     <l n="7">Most clearly in a glaring error prove ,</l>
     <l n="8">To fancy God will round their actions move ;</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Tis an abuse of what we hold divine ;</l>
     <l n="10">The Devil with them surely must combine .</l>
     <l n="11">Besides , ‘ twere folly to suppose that vice</l>
     <l n="12">Ne'er entered convent walls , and nuns were ice .</l>
     <l n="13">A very diff'rent sentiment I hold :</l>
     <l n="14">Girls , who in publick move , however bold ,</l>
     <l n="15">Have greater terrors lest they get a stain ;</l>
     <l n="16">For , honour lost , they never fame regain .</l>
     <l n="17">Few enemies their modesty attack ;</l>
     <l n="18">The others have but one their minds to rack .</l>
     <l n="19">TEMPTATION , daughter of the drowsy dame ,</l>
     <l n="20">That hates to move , and IDLENESS we name ,</l>
     <l n="21">Is ever practising each wily art ,</l>
     <l n="22">To spread her snares around the throbbing heart ;</l>
     <l n="23">And fond DESIRE , the child of lorn CONSTRAINT ,</l>
     <l n="24">Is anxious to the soul soft scenes to paint .</l>
     <l n="25">If I 've a worthy daughter made a nun ,</l>
     <l n="26">Is that a reason she 's a saint ?— Mere fun !</l>
     <l n="27">Avaunt such folly !— three in four you 'll find ,</l>
     <l n="28">Of those who wear the veil — have changed their mind ;</l>
     <l n="29">Their fingers bite , and often do much worse :</l>
     <l n="30">Those convent vows , full soon , become a curse ;</l>
     <l n="31">Such things at least have sometimes reached my ear</l>
     <l n="32">( For doubtless I must speak from others here ) ;</l>
     <l n="33">Of his Boccace a merry tale has told ,</l>
     <l n="34">Which into rhyme I 've put , as you 'll behold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="35">WITHIN a nunnery , in days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="36">A good old man supplied the garden-store ;</l>
     <l n="37">The nuns , in general , were smart and gay ,</l>
     <l n="38">And kept their tongues in motion through the day .</l>
     <l n="39">Religious duties they regarded less ,</l>
     <l n="40">Than for the palour * to be nice in dress</l>
     <l n="41">Arranging ev'ry article to please ,</l>
     <l n="42">That each might captivate and charm at ease ;</l>
     <l n="43">The changes constantly they rang around ,</l>
     <l n="44">And made the convent-walls with din resound .</l>
     <l n="45">Eight sisters and an abbess held the place ,</l>
     <l n="46">And strange to say — there DISCORD you might trace .</l>
     <l n="47">All nine had youth , and many beauty too :</l>
     <l n="48">Young friars round the place were oft in view ,</l>
     <l n="49">Who reckoned ev'ry step they took so well ,</l>
     <l n="50">That always in the proper road they fell .</l>
     <l n="51">Th ’ aged gard'ner , of whom ere now we spoke ,</l>
     <l n="52">Was oft bewildered , they would so provoke ;</l>
     <l n="53">Capricious , whimsical , from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="54">Each would command and try to have her way ;</l>
     <l n="55">And as they ne'er agreed among themselves ,</l>
     <l n="56">He suffered more than if with fifty elves ;</l>
     <l n="57">When one was pleased , another soon complained :</l>
     <l n="58">At length to quit the nuns he was constrained .</l>
     <l n="59">He left them , poor and wretched as he came ;</l>
     <l n="60">No cross , pile , money :— e'en his coat the same .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="61">A YOUTH of Lamporechio , gay and bold ,</l>
     <l n="62">One day this gard'ner met as I am told ;</l>
     <l n="63">And after conversation ‘ bout the place ,</l>
     <l n="64">Said , he should like nun 's service to embrace ,</l>
     <l n="65">And that he wished sincerely to be hired :</l>
     <l n="66">He 'd gratis do whatever was required .</l>
     <l n="67">‘ Twas clear indeed his object was not pelf ;</l>
     <l n="68">He thought however he might reward himself ;</l>
     <l n="69">And as the sisters were not over wise ,</l>
     <l n="70">A nun he now and then might make his prize ;</l>
     <l n="71">Proceed from one to more with like address ,</l>
     <l n="72">Till with the whole he 'd had complete success .</l>
     <l n="73">Said Nuto ( such we find the gard'ner ' s name ) ,</l>
     <l n="74">Believe me , friend , you will be much to blame ;</l>
     <l n="75">Some other service seek , I recommend ;</l>
     <l n="76">These convent-dames will ne'er their whimseys end .</l>
     <l n="77">I 'd rather live without or soup or bread ,</l>
     <l n="78">Than work for them , however nicely fed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="79">STRANGE creatures are these nuns , upon my word ;</l>
     <l n="80">Their ways ridiculous and e'en absurd ;</l>
     <l n="81">Who , with the sisterhood , has never been ,</l>
     <l n="82">Has clearly yet , not perfect torment seen ,</l>
     <l n="83">Such service , prithee , never try to gain ;</l>
     <l n="84">To do what they require I know is vain ;</l>
     <l n="85">One will have soft , and t'other asks for hard :</l>
     <l n="86">Thou'lt be a fool such ninnies to regard ;</l>
     <l n="87">No work thou'lt do , whatever be the want :</l>
     <l n="88">THIS cabbages ,— THAT carrots tells thee plant :</l>
     <l n="89">Said t'other , fain I 'd bring it to the test ;</l>
     <l n="90">I 'm but a simpleton , it is confessed ;</l>
     <l n="91">Yet still a month in place , and thou wilt see ;</l>
     <l n="92">How well I with the convent-dames agree .</l>
     <l n="93">The reason is , my life is in its prime ,</l>
     <l n="94">While thou art sunk in years and worn by time ,</l>
     <l n="95">I 'm proper for their work , and only ask ,</l>
     <l n="96">To be admitted to the drudging task .</l>
     <l n="97">Well , said the former , if resolved to try ,</l>
     <l n="98">To their factotum instantly apply ;</l>
     <l n="99">Come ; let 's away . Lead on , the other cried ;</l>
     <l n="100">I 've got a thought , which I 'll to you confide :—</l>
     <l n="101">I 'll seem an idiot , and quite dumb appear .—</l>
     <l n="102">In that , said Nuto , only persevere ,</l>
     <l n="103">And then perhaps the confessor thou'lt find ,</l>
     <l n="104">With their factotum carelessly inclined ;</l>
     <l n="105">No fears nor dark suspicions of a mute :</l>
     <l n="106">Thou'lt ev'ry way , my friend , their wishes suit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="107">THE place , as was expected , soon he got ;</l>
     <l n="108">And half the grounds to trench , at once his lot :</l>
     <l n="109">He acted well the nincompoop and fool ,</l>
     <l n="110">Yet still was steady to the garden tool ;</l>
     <l n="111">The nuns continually would flock around ,</l>
     <l n="112">And much amusement in his anticks found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="113">ONE day , as sleeping lay our sprightly wight ,</l>
     <l n="114">Or feigning sleep , no matter which is right ,</l>
     <l n="115">( Boccace pretends the latter was the fact )</l>
     <l n="116">Two nuns ( perhaps not two the most exact ,)</l>
     <l n="117">Observing him extended on the sward ,</l>
     <l n="118">While summer 's heat from air so much debarred ;</l>
     <l n="119">That few would venture from the convent-roof ,</l>
     <l n="120">Lest , ‘ gainst the sun , their cheeks should not be proof :</l>
     <l n="121">Said one , approaching him , let 's take this fool ,</l>
     <l n="122">And place him in the garden-house to cool .</l>
     <l n="123">The lad was handsome , with engaging mien :</l>
     <l n="124">The nun admired the features she had seen ,</l>
     <l n="125">And Cupid raised a wish to be at ease ,</l>
     <l n="126">Where she , without restraint , herself might please .</l>
     <l n="127">What would you , cried the other , with him do ?</l>
     <l n="128">You 'll see , rejoined the first , if we pursue ;</l>
     <l n="129">Just what might be expected from the place ;</l>
     <l n="130">Christ ! said the second ( with a cross of grace ) ,</l>
     <l n="131">You would not surely do what is forbid ?</l>
     <l n="132">Suppose increase ? it never could be hid ;</l>
     <l n="133">Besides , should we be seen , ‘ twill be the cause ,</l>
     <l n="134">Of dire disgrace to break such sacred laws .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="135">WE shall not be observed , the first replied ;</l>
     <l n="136">These ills thy fancy forms : haste , let 's decide ,</l>
     <l n="137">And seize the moment while ‘ tis in our reach ,</l>
     <l n="138">Without regard to what old dotards teach ,</l>
     <l n="139">Or what may happen at a future hour ;</l>
     <l n="140">Here 's no one near : ‘ tis fully in our pow'r ;</l>
     <l n="141">The time and place so thoroughly agree ,</l>
     <l n="142">‘ Twill be impossible our freaks to see ;</l>
     <l n="143">But ‘ twill be right that one should watch with care ;</l>
     <l n="144">While t'other with the lad seeks joys to share ,</l>
     <l n="145">And irksome gloom endeavours to dispel :</l>
     <l n="146">He 's dumb , you know , and tales can never tell .</l>
     <l n="147">The other answered , since ‘ tis your desire ,</l>
     <l n="148">I 'll acquiesce and do what you require ;</l>
     <l n="149">You 'll take him first : I see it is your aim ;</l>
     <l n="150">And since it will oblige , I 'll wave my claim ;</l>
     <l n="151">Go , pleasure seek , and satisfy each wish :</l>
     <l n="152">You 're always anxious for a fav'rite dish ;</l>
     <l n="153">‘ Tis only to oblige that I comply .</l>
     <l n="154">That , said the other , clearly I descry ;</l>
     <l n="155">I 'm well persuaded , thou art always kind ;</l>
     <l n="156">But still I think thou would'st not be inclined ;</l>
     <l n="157">In such a scene to take the leading part ,</l>
     <l n="158">Thy bashfulness would counteract thy heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="159">Some time the squeamish sister watched the spot ;</l>
     <l n="160">At length the other , who 'd her wishes got ,</l>
     <l n="161">The station took ; the lab'rer tried to please</l>
     <l n="162">The second as the first , but less at ease ;</l>
     <l n="163">So many favours fell not to her share ,</l>
     <l n="164">And only treble comfort proved her fare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="165">THE garden-path , and summer-house as well ,</l>
     <l n="166">Were well remembered by each wanton belle ;</l>
     <l n="167">No need of guides ; and soon our spark contrived ;</l>
     <l n="168">With sister Agnes also to be hived</l>
     <l n="169">A press-house at the convent end he chose ,</l>
     <l n="170">in which he showed her how soft pleasure flows ;</l>
     <l n="171">Nor Claudia nor Angelica would miss</l>
     <l n="172">The dormitory that , and cellar this ;</l>
     <l n="173">In short the garret and the vaulted cave</l>
     <l n="174">Knew fully how the sisters could behave ;</l>
     <l n="175">Not one but what he first or last regaled</l>
     <l n="176">E'en with the rigid abbess he prevailed ,</l>
     <l n="177">To take a dance , and as the dame required</l>
     <l n="178">Her treble share of what was most admired ,</l>
     <l n="179">The other nuns were oft obliged to fast ,</l>
     <l n="180">While with the convent-head his time was passed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="181">To no restoratives our Wight would run ;</l>
     <l n="182">Though these do little , where much work is done :</l>
     <l n="183">So oft the lad was pressed for cheering play ,</l>
     <l n="184">That with the abbess , when engaged one day ,</l>
     <l n="185">He said , where'er I go , ‘ tis common talk ,</l>
     <l n="186">With only sev'n an able bird should walk ,</l>
     <l n="187">Yet constantly I 've got no less than nine :—</l>
     <l n="188">The abbess cried ,— A miracle divine !</l>
     <l n="189">Here nuns , pray haste , and quickly come around ;</l>
     <l n="190">We 've fasted with success :— his tongue is found .</l>
     <l n="191">The eight encircled him with great surprise ;</l>
     <l n="192">No longer dumb .— they viewed with eager eyes :</l>
     <l n="193">A consultation instantly was had ,</l>
     <l n="194">When ‘ twas agreed to honour well the lad ,</l>
     <l n="195">And try to make him secrecy observe ;</l>
     <l n="196">But if dismissed , from silence he might swerve .</l>
     <l n="197">The active youth , well fed , well paid , thus blessed ,</l>
     <l n="198">Did all he could ,— and others did the rest .</l>
     <l n="199">He for the nuns procured a little lot ,</l>
     <l n="200">That afterward two little friars got ,</l>
     <l n="201">And in the sequel fathers soon became ;</l>
     <l n="202">The sisters mothers too , in spite of shame ;</l>
     <l n="203">But never name more justly was applied :</l>
     <l n="204">In vain their mysteries they strove to hide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="205">* The parlour in a convent is the room where the nuns are</l>
     <l n="206">permitted to speak to their friends through a lattice .</l>
