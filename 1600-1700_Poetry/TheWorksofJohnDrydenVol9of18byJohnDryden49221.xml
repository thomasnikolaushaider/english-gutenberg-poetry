   <head>HEROIC STANZAS</head>
   <head>TO</head>
   <head>THE MEMORY OF OLIVER CROMWELL .</head>
   <p>These verses compose the earliest of our author 's political poems , and are among the first which he wrote , of any length or consequence . The first edition is now before me , by the favour of my friend Richard Heber , Esq . ; and , while correcting this sheet , I received another copy from Mr Finlay , author of the “ Vale of Ellerslie . ” It is of the last degree of rarity , since it has escaped the researches even of Mr Malone . The full title is , “ A Poem upon the Death of his late Highness Oliver , Lord Protector of England , Scotland , and Ireland ; written by Mr Dryden . London , printed for William Wilson , and are to be sold in Well-Yard , near Little St Bartholomew 's Hospital , 1659 , ” 4to . Upon comparing this rare edition with those of a later date , no material alterations occur , excepting that the spelling is modernized , and the title abridged .</p>
   <p>Some of our author 's biographers have deemed it necessary to apologise for his chusing this subject , by referring to his near connection with Sir Gilbert Pickering , the friend and confident of the deceased usurper . There is , however , little reason to suppose , that Dryden did any violence to his own inclinations , to gratify the political feelings of his kinsman and patron . He had been bred in anti-monarchical principles , and did not probably change , till the nation changed with him . The character of Cromwell was in itself an inviting theme to so true a poet . The man , of whom Clarendon said , that “ even his enemies could not condemn him , without commending him at the same time , ” and of whose exploits Cowley has given so animating a detail ; whom , in short , his very enemies could not mention without wonder , if they with-held applause ,— afforded to those who favoured his politics many a point of view , in which the splendour of his character might hide its blemishes .<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>It is remarkable , however , that , in handling this theme , Dryden has observed a singular and happy delicacy . The topic of the civil war is but slightly dwelt on ; and , although Cromwell is extolled , his eulogist abstains from any reflections against those , through whom he cut his way to greatness . He considers the Protector when in his meridian height , but passes over the steps by which he attained that elevation . It is also remarkable , that although Sir Gilbert Pickering was one of Richard Cromwell 's council , our author abstains from any compliment to that pageant of authority ; when a panegyrick upon the son was a natural topic of consolation after mourning over the loss of his father . Sprat , upon the same occasion , did not omit this obvious topic , but launched forth into prophecies , to which the event did very little credit .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></p>
   <p>Notwithstanding these symptoms of caution and moderation , the subject of this first public essay of our author 's poetical talents was repeatedly urged against him during the political controversies in which , through the reigns of Charles II . and his brother , he was constantly engaged . One offended antagonist carried his malice so far , as actually to reprint an edition of the Elegy , with a dull postscript , in which he makes Dryden acknowledge his alleged apostacy .<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></p>
   <p>Of the poetical merits of the Elegy , we have elsewhere spoken more fully . The manly and solemn march of the stanza gave promise of that acute poetical ear , which afterwards enabled Dryden to harmonize our verification . The ideas , though often far-fetched , and sometimes ambiguously expressed , indicate the strength and vigour of his mind . They give obvious tokens of a regeneration of taste ; for though , in many instances , the conceits are very extravagant , yet they are , in general , much more moderate than those in the Elegy upon Lord Hastings , whose whole soul was rendered a celestial sphere , by the virtues which were stuck in it ; and his body little less brilliantly ornamented by the pustules of small pox , which were first rose-buds , and then stars . The symptoms of emerging from the false taste and impertinent witticisms of Donne and Cowley , were probably more owing to our author 's natural feeling of what were the proper attributes of poetry , than to any change in the taste of the age . Sprat , who also solemnizes the decease of Cromwell , runs absolutely riot in pindarics , and furnishes as excellent an instance of useless labour , and wit rendered ridiculous by misapplication , as can be found in Cowley himself . Cromwell 's elevation is compared to the raising up of the brazen serpent , in the Pentateuch ;<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>the classic metamorphosis of Ajax 's blood into the hyacinth<span corresp="#note6" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>furnishes a simile for the supposed revival of letters through the blood spilled by Cromwell ; his sword is preferred to the flaming brand of the cherub , because it had made a paradise , which the other only guarded ; finally , the Protector 's temper grew milder in the progress of his warfare , as his armour , being made of steel , grew smoother by use .<span corresp="#note7" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>It must be allowed , that there are , in Dryden 's poem , many , and greatly too many , epigrammatic turns ; each is , however , briefly winded up in its own stanza ; while the structure of Sprat 's poem enabled him to hunt down his conceits through all the doubling and winding of his long pindaric strophé . Dryden , for example , says , that Cromwell strewed the island with victories ,</p>
   <p>Thick as the galaxy with stars is sown .</p>
   <p>Sprat spins out nearly the same idea , in the following extraordinary manner :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Others ’ great actions are</l>
     <l n="2">But thinly scattered , here and there ;</l>
     <l n="3">At best , but all one single star ;</l>
     <l n="4">But thine the milky way ;</l>
     <l n="5">All one continued light of undistinguished day .</l>
     <l n="6">They thronged so close , that nought else could be seen ,</l>
     <l n="7">Scarce any common sky did come between .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>By turning the reader 's attention to this comparison betwixt the poems of Sprat and Dryden , I mean to shew , that our author was already weaning himself from that franticly witty stile of composition , which the most ingenious of his contemporaries continued to practise and admire ; although he did not at once abandon it , but retrenched his quaint conceits before he finally discarded them .</p>
   <p>The poem of Waller on Cromwell 's death , excepting one unhappy and celebrated instance of the bathos ,<span corresp="#note8" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>is the best of his compositions ; and , separately considered , must be allowed to be superior to that of Dryden , by whom he was soon after so far distanced in the poetical career .</p>
   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <note xml:id="note1" place="bottom" n="1">“ What can be more extraordinary , than that a person of mean birth , no fortune , no eminent qualities of body , which have sometimes , or of mind , which have often , raised men to the highest dignities , should have the courage to attempt , and the happiness to succeed in , so improbable a design , as the destruction of one of the most ancient , and most solid founded monarchies upon the earth ? That he should have the power , or boldness , to put his prince and master to an open and infamous death ? To banish that numerous and strongly allied family ? To do all this under the name and wages of a parliament ? To trample upon them , too , as he pleased , and spurn them out of doors when he grew weary of them ? To raise up a new and unheard-of monster out of their ashes ? To stifle that in the very infancy , and set up himself above all things that ever were called sovereign in England ? To oppress all his enemies by arms , and all his friends afterwards by artifice ? To serve all parties patiently for a while , and to command them victoriously at last ? To over-run each corner of the three nations , and overcome with equal facility both the riches of the south and the poverty of the north ? To be feared and courted by all foreign princes , and adopted a brother to the gods of the earth ? To call together parliaments with a word of his pen , and scatter them again with the breath of his mouth ? To be humbly and daily petitioned , that he would please to be hired , at the rate of two millions a year , to be the master of those who had hired him before to be their servant ? To have the estates and lives of three kingdoms as much at his disposal , as was the little inheritance of his father , and to be as noble and liberal in the spending of them ? And , lastly , ( for there is no end of all the particulars of his glory ,) to bequeath all this with one word to his posterity ? To die with peace at home , and triumph abroad ? To be buried among kings , and with more than regal solemnity ? And to leave a name behind him , not to be extinguished but with the whole world , which as it is now too little for his praises , so might have been too for his conquests if the short line of his human life could have been stretched out to the extent of his immortal designs ? ” — COWLEY 'S Works , Vol . II . p. 583 .</note>
   <p>Perhaps the facetious Tom Brown has hit upon the true reason of Dryden 's choice of a subject , when he makes him say , “ that he had no particular kindness for the person of Oliver ; but that it was much the same with the poets as with the Jews — a hero cannot start up in any quarter of the world , be his quarrel right or wrong , but both are apt to think him the Messias , and presently pitch upon him as the fittest person to deliver the twelve tribes and the nine muses out of captivity . ” — Reasons of Mr Bayes ’ changing his religion . ]</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Cromwell 's disease , a fever and tertian ague , was accompanied by fits of swooning , which occasioned , more than once , a premature report of his death . It was probably this circumstance , which made some of his fanatical chaplains doubt the fact , after it had actually taken place . “ Say not he is dead , ” exclaimed one of them , like Omar over the corpse of Mahomet ; “ for , if ever the Lord heard my prayers , he has assured me of the life of the Protector . ” The two last lines of the stanza allude to the Roman custom of letting an eagle fly from the funeral pile of a deceased emperor , which represented his spirit soaring to the regions of bliss , or his guardian genius convoying it thither . It is described at length in the fourth book of Herodian , who says , that , after this ceremony of consecration , the deceased emperor was enrolled among the Roman deities .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Cromwell was upwards of forty before he made any remarkable figure ; and Pompey , when he had attained the same period of life , was deserted by the good fortune which had accompanied his more early career .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Essex , Manchester , Sir William Waller , and the earlier generals of the Parliament , were all of the Presbyterian party , who , though they had drawn the sword against the king , had no will to throw away the scabbard . They were disposed so to carry on the war , that , neither party being too much weakened , a sound and honourable peace might have been accomplished on equal terms . But the Independants flew at higher game ; and , as the more violent party usually prevail during times of civil discord , they attained their object . Cromwell openly accused the Earl of Manchester of having refused to put an end to the war , after the last battle at Newbury , when a single charge upon the King 's rear might have dissipated his army for ever . “ I offered , ” he averred , “ to perform the work with my own brigade of horse ; let Manchester and the rest look on , if they thought fit : but he obstinately refused to permit the attempt , alleging , that , if the king 's army was beaten , he would find another ; but if that of the Parliament was overthrown , there would be an end of their cause , and they would be all punished as traitors . ” This suspicion of the compromising temper of the Presbyterian leaders , led to the famous self-denying ordinance , by which all members of both houses were declared incapable of holding a military command . By this new model , all the power of the army was thrown , nominally , into the hands of Fairfax , but , really and effectually , into that of Cromwell , who was formally excepted from the operation of the act , and of the Independants ; men determined to push the war to extremity , and who at length triumphed over both King and Parliament .</p>

     <l n="2">To staunch the blood , by breathing of the vein .— St . XII . p. 10 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This passage , which seems to imply nothing farther than that Cromwell conducted the war so as to push it to a conclusion , was afterwards invidiously interpreted by Dryden 's enemies , as containing an explicit approbation of the execution of Charles I .</p>

   <p>Another witling , to add to the heinousness of this expression , assures us , that Dryden had at first declared for the king , then for the parliament , and , finally , for Cromwell :</p>

     <l n="1">I for the Royal Martyr first declared ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>These are examples of the inveteracy , with which Dryden 's enemies were ready to wrest his expressions from the common interpretation into one more strong and unwarrantable . Dryden , sufficiently embarrassed by the praises he had bestowed on the Usurper , a charge from which he could not vindicate himself , took no notice of the uncandid lengths to which it was carried .</p>

   <p>Notwithstanding the inconstancy of Victory during the civil war , she never deserted the banner of Cromwell . Even in undecided conflicts , the brigade , or wing , with which he fought , had always the superiority . The royalists never once saw him fly before them , during all the pitched battles in which he was engaged in England , Scotland , and Ireland .</p>

   <p>This odd simile is borrowed from a very singular , and somewhat dubious event , said to have happened during the siege of Bologna in 1512 . A mine had been run by the Spanish besieging army under a part of the wall , on which was built a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin . Upon the explosion , the chapel and portion of the wall which formed its support were heaved into the air , so high , that ( in spite of all the smoke and dust accompanying such an eruption ) an elegant historian assures us , the besiegers could see , through the vacant space , the buildings of the town , and the defenders ready to man the breach . Nevertheless , the chapel and fragment of wall descended so exactly into the space they had formerly occupied , that the breach was completely and accurately repaired . The chapel acquired by this incident a great reputation for miraculous sanctity . The event is more fully narrated in the following passage of the original :</p>
   <p>“ Finita in ultimo la mina , e stando l'esercito armato per dare incontinente la battaglia , la quale perchè si desse con maggiori forze , era stata richiamata l'antiguardia , fece il Navarra dare il fuoco alla mina ; la quale con grandissimo impeto , e romore gittò talmente in alto la cappella , che per quello spatio , che rimase tra'l terreno , e'l muro gittato in alto , fu da quelli , ch ’ erano fuora , veduta apertamente la città dentro , et i soldati che stavano preparati per difenderla ; ma subito scendendo in giừ ritornò il muro intero nel luogo medesimo , onde la violentia del fuoco l'areva sbarrato , e si ricongiunse insieme , come se mai non fusse stato mosso : onde si non si potendo assaltare da quella parte , i capitani giudicurono non si dovere dare solamente dall ’ altra . Attribuirono questo caso i Bolognesi a miracolo , riputando impossibile , che , senza l'ajutorio divino , fusse potuto riconguignersi cosi appunto ne ’ medesimi fondamenti ; onde fu dipoi ampliata quella cappella , e frequentata con non piccola divotione del popolo . ” L'Istoria di Guicciardini , Libro Decimo .</p>

   <p>Her safety rescued Ireland to him owes .— St . XVII . p. 11 .</p>
   <p>The gallant Ormond , who commanded for the king in Ireland , had reduced the island almost entirely under the royal authority , excepting the cities of Dublin and Londonderry , when the arrival of Cromwell , appointed lord governor by the parliament , entirely changed the scene . In less than ten months , that fated general over-ran the whole kingdom . Tredagh he took by storm ; and such terror was struck into the minds of the Irish , by the bloody execution attending and following that assault , that almost all the other garrisons surrendered without resistance , or revolted to the parliament .</p>

     <l n="1">—— Treacherous Scotland , to no interest true ,</l>
     <l n="2">Yet blest that fate which did his arms dispose</l>
     <l n="3">Her land to civilize , as to subdue .— St . XVII . p. 11 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Cromwell 's wars in Scotland form a brilliant part of his history . After narrowly escaping the snares of the veteran Lesley , whose admirable manœuvres compelled him , with woeful anticipations of farther misfortune , to retreat towards Dunbar , he was enabled , by the rashness of the Scottish kirkmen , totally to defeat that fine army . Edinburgh castle next surrendered ; and the war being carried across the Forth , the Scots were again routed with slaughter at Inverkeithing . Then followed the irruption of the king into England , and the fatal defeat at Worcester , which Cromwell used to call his “ crowning mercy . ”</p>
   <p>Scotland is here called treacherous , because , having been the first to take up arms against King Charles I. she was the last to lay them down in behalf of his son ; or rather , because the Presbyterian party in that country joined the young King against the Independants , as they had joined the Parliament against the Prelatists : for , the war , which in England related chiefly to dissentions concerning the Civil government , was in Scotland entirely to be referred to religious controversy .</p>
   <p>Cromwell certainly did much to civilize Scotland . Some of his benefits were intentionally conferred , others flowed indirectly from the measures he adopted for the consolidation of his own authority . The English judges , whom he appointed , introduced into the administration of justice a purity and vigour , with which Scotland had been hitherto unacquainted .<span corresp="#note30" type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>By the impoverishment , exile , and annihilation of the principal baronial families , the chains of feudal bondage were lightened upon the peasantry ; and the pay of 18 , 000 men , levied to maintain the constituted authorities , enriched the lower orders , amongst whom it was spent . The English soldiers also introduced into Scotland some of the arts of a more civilized country . We may , however , hesitate to believe , that they taught the citizens of Aberdeen to make shoes and plant kail ; because Dr Johnson , upon whose authority the tradition is given , informs us , that the peasantry live upon that vegetable alone , and that , when they had not kail , they probably had nothing ; in which case , the English military guests had better have learned from their Aberdonian hosts the art of living upon nothing , than taught them a branch of gardening which their habits of abstinence rendered totally superfluous . But the garrisons established by Cromwell upon the skirts , and in the passes of the Highlands , restrained the predatory clans , and taught them , in no gentle manner , that respect for the property of their Lowland neighbours , which their lawful monarchs had vainly endeavoured to inculcate . An officer of engineers , quartered at Inverness shortly after 1720 , says , that the name of Oliver still struck terror through the Highlands ; and one very ancient laird declared to him , the appearance of the Protector 's colours were so strongly impressed on his memory , that he still thought he saw them before his eyes , spread out by the wind , and bearing , in great golden characters , the word Emanuel .— Letters from the North of Scotland , Vol .

   <p>The war betwixt the republics had been disastrous to the Dutch , and the peace of 1654 was degrading to the States , though not proportionally disadvantageous . They consented to desert the cause of the exiled Stuarts , and to punish the authors of the massacre at Amboyna ; they yielded to the English the honour of the flag in the narrow seas ; they agreed to pay to the East India Company eighty-five thousand pounds , in compensation of damage done to them ; and they consented to the cession of the island of Polerone in the East Indies : lastly , by a secret article , the province of Holland guaranteed an assurance , that neither the young Prince of Orange , whose connection with the exiled family rendered him an object of the Protector 's suspicion , nor any of his family , should be invested with the office of Stadtholder .</p>

   <p>In 1655 , Cromwell allied himself with the rising power of France against the declining monarchy of Spain ; less guided , probably , by any general views of political expedience , than by the consideration , that the American and West India settlements of the latter power lay open to assault from the English fleet ; while , had he embraced the other side , his own dominions were exposed to an invasion from the exiled king , with French auxiliaries . The splendid triumphs of Blake gave some ground for the poetical flourishes in the text .</p>

   <p>The poet alludes to the exertions of the six thousand British auxiliaries , whom Cromwell sent to join Marshal Turenne in Flanders . These veterans , seasoned to the desperate and close mode of fighting , which the inveteracy of civil war had introduced , astonished the French by their audacity , and their contempt of the usual military precautions and calculations . There is a curious account , by Sir Thomas Morgan , of their exploits at Dunkirk and Ypres , which occurs in the third volume of the Harleian Miscellany , p. 326 . The Duke of York was then with the Spanish army ; and Dryden , on the change of times , lived to celebrate him for his gallant opposition to that body , which he here personifies as the British Lion . See the Dedication of the “ Conquest of Granada , ” Vol . IV . p. 11 . The English were made “ free-men of the continent ” by the cession of Dunkirk ; and it is believed , that this was the first step towards giving England a share in the partition of Flanders , when that strange project was disconcerted by the death of Cromwell . There was no avoiding allusion to the British Lion . Sprat has also sent him forth , seeking whom he may devour :</p>

   <p>The pope being called Alexander the Sixth , Dryden did not disdain to turn this stanza upon an allusion to the Macedonian hero ; although it is obvious , that the pontiff was not a more effectual guardian to his city by bearing that warlike name , than if he had been called Benedict or Innocent . True it is , however , that the pope feared , and with great reason , some hostile attack from the powerful English squadron which swept the Mediterranean , under the command of Blake . Conscious that his papal character rendered him the object of the most inveterate enmity to the military saints of Cromwell 's commonwealth , he had every reason to believe that they would find pride , pleasure , and profit , in attacking Antichrist , even in Babylon itself .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The circumstance , of the dreadful storm which happened on the day of Cromwell 's death , is noticed by all writers . Many vessels were dashed on the coast , and trees and houses were overthrown , upon the land . It seemed as if that active spirit , which had rode in the whirlwind while he lived , could not depart without an universal convulsion of nature . Waller has touched upon this remarkable incident with great felicity :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">We must resign ; heaven his great soul does claim ,</l>
     <l n="2">In storms as loud as his immortal fame ;</l>
     <l n="3">His dying groans , his last breath , shakes our isle ,</l>

     <l n="7">New Rome in such a tempest missed her king ,</l>
     <l n="8">And from obeying fell to worshipping .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But , while the authors of these threnodies explained this prodigious storm as attendant on the deification of the Protector , or at least the effects of the Genius of Britain 's unbounded lamentation , the cavaliers unanimously agreed , that the tempest accompanied the transportation of his spirit to the infernal regions .</p>

   <p>His ashes in a peaceful urn shall rest .— St . XXXVII . p. 14 .</p>
   <p>This prophecy , like that announcing the final close of civil broils , in the preceding stanza , was not doomed to be accomplished . The contending factions resumed their struggles in a month after the Protector 's death ; his body was dragged from the burial place of princes , to be exposed on the gibbet ; and his head placed on the end of Westminster Hall . There is , however , an unauthenticated story , that Cromwell , foreseeing the Restoration , had commanded his remains to be interred secretly , and by night , in the field of Naseby , as near as possible to the spot where his prowess had gained that bloody day ; and that , by a piece of refined and ingenious malice , his friends caused the body of Charles to be deposited in the empty coffin , which had received the funeral honours rendered to the Protector ; thus turning the disgrace , which the royalists intended for the body of Cromwell , upon that of the royal martyr . The story may be found in the Harleian Miscellany , Vol . II . p. 269 . But it is unworthy of credit , and seems to have been grounded upon the circumstance , that Cromwell 's body , being in a very corrupted state , was buried privately before the grand procession . The restoration of the house of Stuart seemed then to be an event much out of the reach of calculation , even to persons less sanguine than Cromwell .</p>
   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <note xml:id="note30" place="bottom" n="30">A principal evil , amongst the native Scottish judges , was a predilection for their own allies and kinsmen . A judge , who lived within the eighteenth century , justified this partiality for “ kith , kin , and ally , ” by saying , “ that , upon his conscience , he could never see any of his friends were in the wrong ; ” and the upright conduct of Cromwell 's English judges being objected to him , he answered , “ it was not wonderful , since they were a set of kinless louns who had no family connections to bias them . ”</note>

   <p>A POEM .</p>
   <p>ASTRÆA REDUX .</p>
   <p>A POEM .</p>
   <p>After so many years of civil war and domestic tyranny , the Restoration , an almost hopeless event , established the crown upon the head of the lawful successor , and the government upon its original footing . Dryden , among the numerous , I had almost said innumerable , bards ,<span corresp="#note31" type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>who celebrated , or attempted to celebrate , this surprising event , distinguished himself by the following poem , to which he has given the apt name of Astræa Redux , from the hopes of justice and liberty returning with the lawful king .</p>
   <p>The tone of praise , which Dryden has adopted , exhibits his usual felicity . There do not here occur any of these rants about the antiquity of the royal line ,<span corresp="#note32" type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>and the indefeasible right of the lawful successor , which are the common topics of the herd , who offered poetical congratulation to the restored monarch . Dryden rejoices with the chastised triumph of one , that had not forgot what it was to mourn . He looks back , as well as forwards ; and it is upon the past sufferings of the people , and of the monarch , that he grounds the hope and expectation of their future happiness . The poet was perhaps sensible , that the claim of loyal merit was rather new in his family and person , and ought not therefore to be expressed with the extravagant colouring of the cavaliers . He ventures indeed upon prophecy , although past experience might have taught him it was dangerous ground . One prediction , however , has been ( magno licet intervallo ) accomplished to its fullest extent in our own age :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Your much-loved fleet shall , with a wide command ,</l>
     <l n="2">Besiege the petty monarchs of the land .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poem exhibits the taste which belongs to the earlier class of Dryden 's compositions , bearing the same marks of attachment to the stile of Waller and Davenant . Some of the similes are brought out with singular ingenuity . Nothing can be more elegant than the turn he gives to the slow , gentle , and almost imperceptible manner , in which the great change which he celebrates was accomplished :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— —— While we</l>
     <l n="2">The effect did feel , but scarce the manner see .</l>
     <l n="3">Frosts , that constrain the ground , and birth deny</l>
     <l n="4">To flowers that in its womb expecting lie ,</l>
     <l n="5">Do seldom their usurping power withdraw ,</l>
     <l n="6">But raging floods pursue their hasty thaw ;</l>
     <l n="7">Our thaw was mild , the frost not chased away ,</l>
     <l n="8">But kindly lost in heat of lengthened day .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On the other hand , it is surely unnecessary to point out to the reader the confusion of metaphor , where Virtue is said to dress the wounds of Charles with laurels ;<span corresp="#note33" type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>the impertinent antithesis of finding “ light alone in dark afflictions ; ” and the extravagance of representing the winds , that wafted Charles , as out of breath with joy . These , and other outrageous flights of wit , have been noticed and blamed by Johnson . I am not certain whether that great critic is equally just , in severely censuring the passage in which there is a short allusion to Heathen mythology .<span corresp="#note34" type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>Where the tender , the passionate , or the sublime , ought to prevail , an allusion to classical fiction seldom fails to interrupt the tone of feeling which the author should seek to preserve ; but in a poem , of which elegance of expression and ingenuity of device are the principal attributes , an allusion to the customs of Greece , or of Rome , while it gives a classic air to the composition , seems as little misplaced , as an apt quotation from the authors in which they are recorded .</p>

     <l n="2">An horrid stillness first invades the ear ,</l>
     <l n="3">And in that silence we the tempest fear .— P . 30 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The small wits of the time made themselves very merry with this couplet ; because stillness , being a mere absence of sound , could not , it was said , be personified , as an active agent , or invader . Captain Ratcliff thus states the objection in his “ News from Hell : ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Laureat , who was both learned and florid ,</l>
     <l n="2">Was damned , long since , for “ silence horrid ; ”</l>
     <l n="3">Nor had there been such clatter made ,</l>
     <l n="4">But that this Silence did “ invade . ”</l>
     <l n="5">Invade ! and so't might well , ‘ tis clear ;</l>
     <l n="6">But what did it invade ?— an ear .</l>
     <l n="7">And for some other things , ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ We follow Fate , that does pursue . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the “ Dialogue in Bedlam , ” between Oliver 's porter , fiddler , and poet , the first of these persons thus addresses L'Estrange and Dryden , “ the scene being adorned with several of the poet 's own flowers : ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">O glory , glory ! who are these appear ?</l>
     <l n="2">My fellow-servants , poet , fiddler , here ?</l>

     <l n="4">Who sent you hither ? and , pray tell me , why ?</l>
     <l n="5">A horrid silence does invade my eye ,</l>
     <l n="6">While not one sound of voice from you I spy .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But , as Dr Johnson justly remarks , we hesitate not to say , the world is invaded by darkness , which is a privation of light ; and why not by silence , which is a privation of sound ?</p>

     <l n="4">To his now guideless kingdom peace bequeathed .— P . 30 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The royal line of Sweden has produced more heroic and chivalrous monarchs , than any dynasty of Europe . The gallant Charles X. who is here mentioned , did not degenerate from this warlike stem . He was a nephew of the great Gustavus Adolphus ; and , like him , was continually engaged in war , particularly against Poland and Austria . He died at Gottenburgh in 1660 , and the peace of Sweden was soon afterwards restored by the treaty of Copenhagen .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The death of Cromwell , and the unsettled state of England , prevented the execution of those ambitious schemes , which Cardinal Mazarine , then prime minister of France , had hoped to accomplish by the assistance of Britain . The Cardinal was therefore , in 1659 , induced to accede to the treaty of the Pyrenees , by which peace was restored betwixt France and Spain ; the union being cemented by the marriage of the Infanta to Louis XIV .— Charles II ., then a needy fugitive , was in attendance upon the ministers of France and Spain , when they met on the frontiers for this great object ; but he , who was soon to be so powerful a monarch , experienced on that occasion nothing but slights from Mazarine , and cold civility from Don Lewis de Haro .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>This does not mean , as Derrick conceived , that these emblems of authority had as little effect upon the mob as if they had been shown to an elephant ; but that the sight of them animated the people to such senseless fury , as elephants , and many other animals , are said to shew , upon seeing any object of a red colour .</p>

     <l n="1">He would not , like soft Otho , fate prevent ,</l>
     <l n="2">But stayed , and suffered fortune to repent .— P . 32 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The emperor Otho , whose mind and manners exhibited so many contradictions , is described as one of the most effeminate of men in his outward habits ; his mind , however , was active and energetic . “ Non erat Othonis , mollis et corpori similis , animus . ” TACITI , Lib . i . Historiarum .— He slew himself after the battle of Brixellum , in which he was vanquished by Vitellius . The prætorian guards , and his other followers , in vain urged him to try his fortune again in the field . Whether from that impatience of sustaining adversity , which luxurious habits seldom fail to produce , or from the generous desire of ending a disastrous civil war , he retained and executed his resolution . It is , however , no extraordinary compliment to Charles , that he did not , after his defeat at Worcester , follow an example more classical than inviting .</p>

     <l n="1">These virtues Galba in a stranger sought ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Piso to adopted empire brought .— P . 32 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Galba adopted Piso Frugi Licinianus as his successor in the empire . He was a stranger to his blood , and only endeared to him by his good qualities . Tacitus puts these words in the mouth of Galba upon this occasion : “ Nunc me , deorum hominumque consensu , ad imperium vocatum , preclara indoles tua , et amor patriæ impulit , ut principatum , de quo majores nostri armis certabant , bello adeptus , quiescenti offeram ; exemplo divi Augusti , qui sororis filium Marcellum , dein generum Agrippam , mox nepotes suos , postremo Tiberium Neronem privignum , in proximo sibi fastigio , collocavit . Sed Augustus in domo successorem quæsivit , ego in republica : non quia propinquos aut socios belli non habeam ; sed neque ipse imperium ambitione accessi , et judicii mei documentum sit non meæ tantum necessitudines quas tibi postposui sed et tuæ . ” — Lib . I. Historiarum , cap . xv .</p>

   <p>All at Worc'ster but the honour lost .— P . 32 .</p>
   <p>This is in imitation of the famous letter which Francis the First of France wrote to his mother after the battle of Pavia : “ Madam , all is lost except our honour . ” That of Charles II . certainly was not lost at Worcester . He gave many marks of personal courage , and was only hurried off the field by the torrent of fugitives . He halted a large body of horse , and implored them to return , and but look upon the enemy ; yet , though he advanced at their head , they all deserted him but a few of his immediate attendants .</p>

     <l n="1">Shocked by a covenanting League 's vast powers ,</l>
     <l n="2">As holy and as catholic as ours .— P . 33 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The parallel between the French League and the Covenant had already occurred to Dryden as a proper subject for the stage ; for , in the first year after the Restoration , he wrote several scenes of “ The Duke of Guise , ” though it was not finished or acted till long afterwards . See Vol . VII . p. 137 .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The ceremonies of classical antiquity , observed by those who escaped from shipwreck , are here detailed . The alga , or sea-weed , sprinkled on the altar , alluded to the cause of their sacrifice . Portunus , otherwise called Portumnus , was a sea-god of some reputation . The Greeks called him Palæmon , which was formerly his earthly name . He is mentioned by Virgil :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Upon the death of Cromwell , in 1659 , the cavaliers resolved upon a general rising ; but their intentions being betrayed by Sir Richard Willis , the insurrection only took place at Chester , which was seized by Sir George Booth and Sir William Middleton . They ventured imprudently into the open field to face Lambert , by whom they were totally routed ; so that the royal party in England never seemed to lie under such total depression , as when it was about to triumph over all opposition .</p>

     <l n="1">—— That polluted nest ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whence Legion twice before was dispossest .— P . 35 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Alluding to Cromwell 's dissolution of the Long Parliament , with the memorable words , “ Ye are no longer a parliament ; I tell you , ye are no longer a parliament ; the Lord has done with you . ” General Harrison then pulled the speaker from the chair ; and Worsley , with two file of musketeers , expelled the refractory members , Cromwell loading each of them with personal revilings . When the house was cleared , he , with great composure , locked the doors , and took the key home in his pocket . Legion was a second time dispossessed by the same kind of exorcism , when the House of Commons was occupied by that extraordinary assembly , usually called , from the name of a distinguished member , “ Praise God Barebone 's Parliament . ” This motley assembly of crazy fanatics , having shewn some disposition to extend the reign of the saints , in a manner rather inconsistent with Cromwell 's views of exclusive domination , were suddenly dissolved by him . A remnant , headed by the frantic enthusiast Harrison , continued to sit till their deliberations were interrupted by White with a party of soldiers , who demanded , “ what they did there ? ” “ We are seeking the Lord , ” answered they . “ Then go seek him elsewhere , ” rejoined the commander ; “ for to my knowledge he has not been here these many years . ” Or Dryden may have referred to the terms upon which Cromwell parted with his last parliament ; to whom he swore , by the living God , they should not sit an hour longer ; and calling upon the Lord to be judge between them , ( to which many members answered , Amen ,) turned them about their business . Indeed , when we consider , that the Long Parliament was , after Cromwell 's death , restored and cashiered more than once , the line might have more properly run ,</p>
   <p>Whence Legion oft before was dispossessed .</p>

     <l n="1">Thus Sforza , cursed with a too fertile brain ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lost by his wiles the power his wit did gain .— P . 36 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This subtle politician was Lodovico , son of Francisco Sforza . He was one of the most restless and intriguing spirits , that Italy , the mother of political genius , has ever produced . His natural brother , Francisco Sforza , had acquired , by marriage , the duchy of Milan , which he left to his son Giovanni Galeazzo Sforza . Lodovico , under pretence of acting as his nephew 's tutor , took into his own hands the supreme power ; and , tired of governing under the name of another , at length deposed and murdered the young duke . In order to secure himself in his usurped domination , he invited the French into Italy , which they over-ran and conquered under Charles VIII . He became soon suspicious of these too powerful allies , and leagued with the Venetians to cut off the retreat of the French from Naples . In 1594 , he made a pretended peace with Charles ; and , in the year following , invited into Italy the Emperor Maximilian , by whose assistance he hoped to secure himself in Pisa , of which he had taken possession , and to conquer the Florentines , with whom he was at war . In all these , and many other ambiguous and versatile transactions , Sforza was so happy , that he used to call himself the Son of Fortune , as he was termed by others the Moor , from his dark complection , acute genius , and cruel disposition . But , in 1599 , Lewis XII ., who had pretensions upon the dukedom of Milan , as the grandson of Valentine Visconti , daughter of Giovanni Galeazzo , Duke of Milan , invaded the Milanese territory with a force which Sforza was unable to resist , and compelled him to fly into Germany with his treasures . In 1600 , Sforza again returned to Italy at the head of an army of Swiss mercenaries , and repossessed himself of Milan , Como , and other places of importance . The Swiss , however , mutinied at Novara , and not only refused to fight in his behalf , but even to guard him to a place of security . As these unworthy Helvetians had made a private convention with the French , they permitted them to seize the person of Sforza , who was discovered among the ranks of his faithless mercenaries , dressed and armed like a private Swiss soldier ; a lamentable instance of the inconstancy of fortune . He was carried prisoner to France , where he ended his days in prison , A. D. 1608 .</p>

   <p>Those persons , who had sat in any illegal high court of justice , with a few others , were , at the Restoration , declared incapable of bearing any public office . In expressing their violent spirit , our author uses the unnecessary Gallicism fougue , although it might have been as well described by the English fire . Thus disqualified , the poet compares these republicans to the Spartan slaves , made drunk to excite the contempt of the youth for that degrading vice . By the bye , Dryden 's kinsman , Sir Gilbert Pickering , was among the persons so incapacitated .</p>

   <p>“ Several persons now came to Breda , not as heretofore to Cologne and to Brussells , under disguises , and in fear of being discovered , but with bare faces , and the pride and vanity to be taken notice of , to present their duty to the king ; some being employed to procure pardons for those who thought themselves in danger , and to stand in need of them ; others brought good presents in English gold to the king , that their names , and the names of their friends who sent them , might be remembered among the first , who made demonstrations of their affections that way to his majesty , by supplying his necessities ; which had been discontinued for many years , to a degree that cannot be believed , and ought not to be remembered . ” CLARENDON , Vol . III . Part . II . p. 766 . “ In the mean time , Breda swarmed with English ; a multitude repairing thither from all other places , as well as London , with presents , and protestations , how much they had longed and prayed for this blessed change , and magnifying their sufferings under the late tyrannical government , when some of them had been zealous instruments and promoters of it . ” Ibidem , p. 767 .</p>

   <p>When the English fleet came on the coast of Holland , the Duke of York took possession of it , as Lord High Admiral . “ After he had spent the day there in receiving information of the state of the fleet , and a catalogue of the names of the several ships , his Highness returned with it that night to the king , that his majesty might make alterations , and new christen these ships , which too much preserved the memory of the late governors , and of the republic . ” — CLARENDON . The Naseby was too odious a name to be preserved , and it was changed to the Royal Charles , and the Swiftsure to the James .

   <p>Johnson remarks , that this extraordinary piece of complaisance in the land is not without a precedent . A French poet read to Malherbe some verses , in which he mentioned the kingdom of France as advancing to meet the king . “ Though this happened in my time , ” observed the critic , “ it is strange I should not remember it . ” In the next couplet , Albion does penance in a sheet , because her cliffs are chalky ; had they been black , she would have been in mourning of course . But the civility of such inanimate objects , according to the poets of this reign , was truly wonderful , considering their present insensibility .

   <p>By the declaration of King Charles II ., dated at Breda , 14th April , 1660 , a free pardon was promised to all subjects , of what degree or quality soever , for their share in the late civil war , excepting only such as should hereafter be excepted by Parliament . The House of Peers , irritated by their sufferings during the late troubles , were disposed to make very general exceptions from the proposed indemnity . But the king came in person to the house , and beseeched them , in the most affecting terms , to extend the benefit of the bill to all who had not been the immediate instruments of his father 's death . Upon which principle , the “ Act of Oblivion ” was constructed accordingly . Even among the judges of his father , the King distinguished Ingoldsby , and others , as fit objects of mercy . Thus the law 's rigid letter , as pronounced by him , was “ softer made . ”</p>

   <p>Charles II . was born on the 29th of May , 1630 , and upon the same day of the same month , 1660 , he “ renewed the expiring pomp of May , ” by making his triumphal entry into his metropolis , for the purpose of resuming the throne of his forefathers . The immense crowds which assembled to witness an event , which was to close the wounds of civil discord , seemed , says Clarendon , as if the whole kingdom had been gathered together . For a full account of his triumphant procession , with the cloth of gold , and cloth of silver , velvet cloaks , gold chains , kettle-drums , trumpets , and common council-men , see Baker 's Chronicle . One part of the show was particularly striking to the actors in the late commotions : “ I must confess , ” says the republican Ludlow , “ it was a strange sight to me , to see the horse that had formerly belonged to our army , now put upon an employment , so different from that which they had at first undertaken ; especially when I considered , that , for the most part , they had not been raised out of the meanest of the people , and without distinction , as other armies had been ; but that they consisted of such as had engaged themselves from a spirit of liberty , in defence of their rights and religion . ” LUDLOW 'S Memoirs , Vol . III . p. 16 .</p>

   <p>There was a star visible on Charles ’ birth-day , 29th May , 1630 ; a circumstance much dwelt upon , by his party , during the civil wars . Lilly , the astrologer , who embraced the cause of the Commonwealth , assures us , it was nothing more than the planet Venus , which is sometimes visible in the day-time ; and truly , if we judge of the matter by its influence on the merry monarch , Venus has the best title to be held the dominant power at his nativity . Lilly also repeats the following lines , presented to Charles I . ( by the astrologer himself , I suppose ,) when he went to St Paul 's , to return thanks for the birth of his son :</p>

    <head>TO</head>
    <head>HIS SACRED MAJESTY ,</head>
    <head>A</head>
    <head>PANEGYRIC ON HIS CORONATION .</head>
    <head>The ceremony of Charles the Second 's coronation was deferred until the year succeeding his Restoration , when it was solemnized with extreme magnificence , on the 22d April , 1661 , being St George 's day . Charles moved from the Tower to Whitehall , through a series of triumphal arches , stages , and pageants , all of which presented , at once , the joy and wealth of his people before the eyes of the monarch . The poets , it may readily be believed , joined in the general gratulation ; but , from the rudeness of their style , and puerility of their conceits , Charles , whose taste was undoubted , must have soon distinguished our author 's superior energy of diction , and harmony of language . In most respects we may consider this piece as written in the style of the preceding , yet with less affectation of witty and far-fetched allusion . The description of the spring , beginning , “ Now our sad ruins are removed from sight , ” is elegantly fancied , and so smoothly expressed , that even the flow of the language seems to mark the mild and delightful influence of the season it describes . Much quaintness remains to be weeded out . The name of the king is sent on high , wrapped soft and warm in music , like flames on the wings of incense ; and , anon , music has found a tomb in Charles , and lies drowned in her own sweetness ; while the fragrant scent , begun from the royal person , and confined within the hallowed dome , flies round and descends on him in richer dew . Above all , we are startled to hear of</head>
     <l n="1">A queen , near whose chaste womb , ordained by fate ,</l>
     <l n="2">The souls of kings unborn for bodies wait .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Neither , if we read ( with the first edition ) from instead of near , is the intelligibility , or decorum of the passage much improved . If any of the souls of these unborn monarchs waited for bodies from Queen Catharine , they waited long in vain . But with all these defects , there is in this little piece that animation of language and idea , which always affords the most secure promise of genius .</p>
   <p>The first edition is printed for Henry Herringman , 1661 .</p>

     <l n="1">In that wild deluge where the world was drowned ,</l>
     <l n="2">When life and sin one common tomb had found ,</l>
     <l n="3">The first small prospect of a rising hill</l>

     <l n="47">How justly from the church that crown is due ,</l>
     <l n="48">Preserved from ruin , and restored by you !</l>
     <l n="49">The grateful choir their harmony employ ,</l>

   <p>After the Restoration , several of the regicides were condemned to death ; but the king , with unexampled lenity , remitted the capital punishment of many of these deep offenders . Only six of the king 's judges were executed ; and , when to that number are added , the fanatic Peters , who compared the suffering monarch to Barabbas , Coke , the solicitor , who pleaded against Charles on his mock trial , and Hacker , who commanded the guard , and brutally instigated , and even compelled them to cry for execution , we have the number of nine , who suffered for a fact , the most enormous in civilized history , till our age produced a parallel . There was also an insurrection of the fierce and hot-brained sect of fanatics , who called themselves fifth-monarchy men , and devoutly believed , that the Millennium , and the reign of the saints , was about to begin . Willing to contribute their share to this happy consummation , these enthusiasts , headed by the fanatic Venner , rushed into the streets of London ; and , though but sixty in number , were not overpowered without long resistance , and much bloodshed . These incidents , Dryden , always happy in his allusion to the events of the day , assigns as a reason for deferring the coronation to an untainted year . Perhaps , however , he only meant to say , that , as Charles was not restored till May , 1660 , the preceding months of that year were unworthy to share in the honour , which the coronation would have conferred upon it .</p>

   <p>The conferences held at Savoy House , betwixt the presbyterians and the bishops , excited hopes among those who did not understand the temper of theological controversy , that these two powerful divisions of the protestant church might be reconciled to each other . The quakers , anabaptists , and other inferior sects , applied , by petitions and humble addresses , to the king , to be permitted to worship God , according to their consciences . Thus , the whole modelling of ecclesiastical matters seemed to be in the hands of the king .</p>

   <p>Charles the Second had a strong mechanical genius , and understood ship-building , in particular , more completely than became a monarch , if it were possible that a king of England could be too intimately acquainted with what concerns the bulwark of his empire . The king 's skill in matters of navigation is thus celebrated by the author of a Poem upon his Majesty 's Coronation , the 22d April , 1661 , being St George 's day .</p>

   <p>By the improvements made by Charles the Second on St James 's Park , there was a connection made with the river , which Waller has celebrated in these lines , as a work of superior merit to founding a city .</p>

   <p>The canal in St James 's park formed a decoy for water-fowl , with which it was stocked . This circumstance , like the former , is noticed by Waller :</p>

     <l n="2">Hangs in the air and does the sun controul .</l>

   <p>The water-fowl , thus celebrated , were particular favourites of the king , who fed them with his own hand . His affection for his dogs and ducks is noticed in many a libel .</p>

   <p>This is in allusion to a device exhibited over the triumphal arch , in Leadenhall street , through which the king passed in his way from the Tower to Whitehall , on the day of his coronation . Behind a picture of the king appeared , deciphered in a large table , “ the Royal Oak , bearing crowns and sceptres , instead of acorns ; amongst the leaves in a label</p>
   <p>Miraturque novas frondes et non suà poma .</p>
   <p>As designing its reward , for the shelter it afforded his majesty , after the fight at Worcester . "[ 76 ] These devices were invented by John Ogilby , gent ., to the conduct of whom the poetical part of the coronation , as it is termed in his writ of privilege , was solely entrusted . The same fancy is commemorated , by the author of “ Loyal Reflections on his Majesty 's Restoration , Procession , and Coronation , ” who thus apostrophises the Royal Oak :</p>

    <p>TO</p>
    <p>LORD CHANCELLOR HYDE .</p>
     <l n="1">&amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The great statesman , to whom Dryden made this new-year 's offering , was the well known Earl of Clarendon , of whose administration Hume gives the following striking account :</p>
   <p>“ Clarendon not only behaved with wisdom and justice in the office of chancellor : all the counsels , which he gave the king , tended equally to promote the interest of prince and people . Charles , accustomed , in his exile , to pay entire deference to the judgment of this faithful servant , continued still to submit to his direction ; and for some time no minister was ever possessed of more absolute authority . He moderated the forward zeal of the royalists , and tempered their appetite for revenge . With the opposite party , he endeavoured to preserve , inviolate , all the king 's engagements . He kept an exact register of the promises which had been made , for any service ; and he employed all his industry to fulfil them . ”</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the merits of Clarendon , and our author 's prophecy in the following verses , that</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He had already wearied fortune so ,</l>
     <l n="2">She could no longer be his friend or foe ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>this great statesman was doomed to be one of the numberless victims to the uncertainty of court favour . His fall took place in 1667 , when he was attainted and banished . The popular discontent was chiefly excited against him , by a groundless charge of corruption ; an accusation to which the vulgar lend a greedy and implicit faith , because ignorance is always suspicious , and low minds , not knowing how seldom avarice is the companion of ambition , conceive the opportunities of peculation to be not only numerous , but irresistibly tempting . Accordingly , the heroes of Athens , as well as the patriots of Rome , were usually stigmatized with this crime ; bare suspicion of which , it would seem , is usually held adequate to the fullest proof . Nor have instances been wanting in our own days , of a party adopting the same mode , to blacken the character of those , whose firmness and talents impeded their access to power , and public confidence .</p>
   <p>In the address to the Chancellor , Dryden has indulged his ingenuity in all the varied and prolonged comparisons and conceits , which were the taste of his age . Johnson has exemplified Dryden 's capacity of producing these elaborate trifles , by referring to the passage , which compares the connection between the king and his minister , to the visible horizon . “ It is , ” says he , “ so successfully laboured , that though at last it gives the mind more perplexity than pleasure , and seems hardly worth the study that it costs ; yet it must be valued , as the proof of a mind at once subtle and comprehensive . ” The following couplet , referring to the friendship of Charles I , when in his distresses , for Clarendon , contains a comparison , which is eminently happy :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Our setting sun , from his declining seat ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shot beams of kindness on you , not of heat .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In general , this poem displays more uniform adherence to the metaphysical style of Cowley , and his contemporaries , than occurs in any of Dryden 's other compositions . May we not suppose , that , in addressing Clarendon , he adopted the style of those muses , with whom the Chancellor had conversed in his earlier days , in preference to the plainer and more correct taste , which Waller , and Denham , had begun to introduce ; but which , to the aged statesman , could have brought no recollection of what he used to consider as poetry ? Certain , at least , it is , that , to use the strong language of Johnson , Dryden never after ventured “ to bring on the anvil such stubborn and unmanageable thoughts ; ” and these lines afford striking evidence , how the lever of genius , like that of machinery applied to material substances , can drag together , and compel the approximation of the most unsociable ideas . Our admiration of both , however , is much qualified , when they are applied rather to make exhibition of their own powers , than for any better purpose .</p>

    <head>TO</head>
    <head>THE LORD-CHANCELLOR HYDE .</head>
    <head>PRESENTED ON NEW-YEAR'ShYpppHeNDAY , 1662 .</head>
    <head>MY LORD ,</head>
     <l n="1">While flattering crouds officiously appear</l>
     <l n="2">To give themselves , not you , an happy year ,</l>
     <l n="3">And by the greatness of their presents prove</l>
     <l n="4">How much they hope , but not how well they love ,—</l>
     <l n="5">The Muses , who your early courtship boast ,</l>
     <l n="6">Though now your flames are with their beauty lost ,</l>
     <l n="7">Yet watch their time , that , if you have forgot</l>
     <l n="8">They were your mistresses , the world may not .</l>
     <l n="9">Decayed by time and wars , they only prove</l>
     <l n="10">Their former beauty by their former love ;</l>
     <l n="11">And now present , as ancient ladies do ,</l>
     <l n="12">That , courted long , at length are forced to woo :</l>
     <l n="13">For still they look on you with such kind eyes ,</l>
     <l n="14">As those , that see the Church 's sovereign rise ,</l>
     <l n="15">From their own order chose , in whose high state</l>
     <l n="16">They think themselves the second choice of fate .</l>
     <l n="17">When our great monarch into exile went ,</l>
     <l n="18">Wit and religion suffered banishment .</l>
     <l n="19">Thus once , when Troy was wrapped in fire and smoke ,</l>
     <l n="20">The helpless gods their burning shrines forsook ;</l>
     <l n="21">They with the vanquished prince and party go ,</l>
     <l n="22">And leave their temples empty to the foe .</l>
     <l n="23">At length the Muses stand , restored again</l>
     <l n="24">To that great charge which nature did ordain ;</l>
     <l n="25">And their loved druids seem revived by fate ,</l>
     <l n="26">While you dispense the laws , and guide the state .</l>
     <l n="27">The nation 's soul , our monarch , does dispense ,</l>
     <l n="28">Through you , to us his vital influence :</l>
     <l n="29">You are the channel , where those spirits flow ,</l>
     <l n="30">And work them higher , as to us they go .</l>
     <l n="31">In open prospect nothing bounds our eye ,</l>
     <l n="32">Until the earth seems joined unto the sky :</l>
     <l n="33">So in this hemisphere , our utmost view</l>
     <l n="34">Is only bounded by our king and you ;</l>
     <l n="35">Our sight is limited where you are joined ,</l>
     <l n="36">And beyond that no farther heaven can find .</l>
     <l n="37">So well your virtues do with his agree ,</l>
     <l n="38">That , though your orbs of different greatness be ,</l>
     <l n="39">Yet both are for each other 's use disposed ,</l>
     <l n="40">His to inclose , and yours to be inclosed :</l>
     <l n="41">Nor could another in your room have been ,</l>
     <l n="42">Except an emptiness had come between .</l>
     <l n="43">Well may he , then , to you his cares impart ,</l>
     <l n="44">And share his burden where he shares his heart .</l>
     <l n="45">In you his sleep still wakes ; his pleasures find</l>
     <l n="46">Their share of business in your labouring mind .</l>
     <l n="47">So , when the weary sun his place resigns ,</l>
     <l n="48">He leaves his light , and by reflection shines .</l>
     <l n="49">Justice , that sits and frowns where public laws</l>
     <l n="50">Exclude soft mercy from a private cause ,</l>
     <l n="51">In your tribunal most herself does please ;</l>
     <l n="52">There only smiles because she lives at ease ;</l>
     <l n="53">And , like young David , finds her strength the more ,</l>
     <l n="54">When disincumbered from those arms she wore .</l>
     <l n="55">Heaven would your royal master should exceed</l>
     <l n="56">Most in that virtue , which we most did need ;</l>
     <l n="57">And his mild father ( who too late did find</l>
     <l n="58">All mercy vain but what with power was joined )</l>
     <l n="59">His fatal goodness left to fitter times ,</l>
     <l n="60">Not to increase , but to absolve our crimes :</l>
     <l n="61">But when the heir of this vast treasure knew</l>
     <l n="62">How large a legacy was left to you ,</l>
     <l n="63">( Too great for any subject to retain )</l>
     <l n="64">He wisely tied it to the crown again ;</l>
     <l n="65">Yet , passing through your hands , it gathers more ,</l>
     <l n="66">As streams , through mines , bear tincture of their ore .</l>
     <l n="67">While emp'ric politicians use deceit ,</l>
     <l n="68">Hide what they give , and cure but by a cheat ;</l>
     <l n="69">You boldly shew that skill which they pretend ,</l>
     <l n="70">And work by means as noble as your end ;</l>
     <l n="71">Which should you veil , we might unwind the clue ,</l>
     <l n="72">As men do nature , till we came to you .</l>
     <l n="73">And , as the Indies were not found before</l>
     <l n="74">Those rich perfumes , which , from the happy shore ,</l>
     <l n="75">The winds upon their balmy wings conveyed ,</l>
     <l n="76">Whose guilty sweetness first their world betrayed ;</l>
     <l n="77">So , by your counsels , we are brought to view</l>
     <l n="78">A rich and undiscovered world in you .</l>
     <l n="79">By you our monarch does that fame assure ,</l>
     <l n="80">Which kings must have , or cannot live secure :</l>
     <l n="81">For prosperous princes gain their subjects ’ heart ,</l>
     <l n="82">Who love that praise in which themselves have part .</l>
     <l n="83">By you he fits those subjects to obey ,</l>
     <l n="84">As heaven 's eternal monarch does convey</l>
     <l n="85">His power unseen , and man , to his designs ,</l>
     <l n="86">By his bright ministers , the stars , inclines .</l>
     <l n="87">Our setting sun , from his declining seat ,</l>
     <l n="88">Shot beams of kindness on you , not of heat ;</l>
     <l n="89">And , when his love was bounded in a few</l>
     <l n="90">That were unhappy , that they might be true ,</l>
     <l n="91">Made you the favourite of his last sad times ,</l>
     <l n="92">That is a sufferer in his subjects ’ crimes :</l>
     <l n="93">Thus , those first favours you received , were sent ,</l>
     <l n="94">Like heaven 's rewards , in earthly punishment :</l>
     <l n="95">Yet fortune , conscious of your destiny ,</l>
     <l n="96">E'en then took care to lay you softly by ,</l>
     <l n="97">And wrapped your fate among her precious things ,</l>
     <l n="98">Kept fresh to be unfolded with your king 's .</l>
     <l n="99">Shewn all at once , you dazzled so our eyes ,</l>
     <l n="100">As new-born Pallas did the gods surprise ,</l>
     <l n="101">When , springing forth from Jove 's new-closing wound ,</l>
     <l n="102">She struck the warlike spear into the ground ;</l>
     <l n="103">Which sprouting leaves did suddenly inclose ,</l>
     <l n="104">And peaceful olives shaded as they rose .</l>
     <l n="105">How strangely active are the arts of peace ,</l>
     <l n="106">Whose restless motions less than war 's do cease !</l>
     <l n="107">Peace is not freed from labour , but from noise ;</l>
     <l n="108">And war more force , but not more pains employs .</l>
     <l n="109">Such is the mighty swiftness of your mind ,</l>
     <l n="110">That , like the earth , it leaves our sense behind ,</l>
     <l n="111">While you so smoothly turn and roll our sphere ,</l>
     <l n="112">That rapid motion does but rest appear .</l>
     <l n="113">For , as in nature 's swiftness , with the throng</l>
     <l n="114">Of flying orbs while ours is borne along ,</l>
     <l n="115">All seems at rest to the deluded eye ,</l>
     <l n="116">Moved by the soul of the same harmony ;</l>
     <l n="117">So , carried on by your unwearied care ,</l>
     <l n="118">We rest in peace , and yet in motion share .</l>
     <l n="119">Let envy , then , those crimes within you see ,</l>
     <l n="120">From which the happy never must be free ;</l>
     <l n="121">( Envy , that does with misery reside ,</l>
     <l n="122">The joy and the revenge of ruined pride . )</l>
     <l n="123">Think it not hard , if , at so cheap a rate ,</l>
     <l n="124">You can secure the constancy of fate ,</l>
     <l n="125">Whose kindness sent what does their malice seem ,</l>
     <l n="126">By lesser ills the greater to redeem ;</l>
     <l n="127">Nor can we this weak shower a tempest call ,</l>
     <l n="128">But drops of heat that in the sun-shine fall .</l>
     <l n="129">You have already wearied Fortune so ,</l>
     <l n="130">She cannot farther be your friend or foe ;</l>
     <l n="131">But sits all breathless , and admires to feel</l>
     <l n="132">A fate so weighty , that it stops our wheel .</l>
     <l n="133">In all things else above our humble fate ,</l>
     <l n="134">Your equal mind yet swells not into state ,</l>
     <l n="135">But , like some mountain in those happy isles ,</l>
     <l n="136">Where in perpetual spring young nature smiles ,</l>
     <l n="137">Your greatness shews ; no horror to affright ,</l>
     <l n="138">But trees for shade , and flowers to court the sight :</l>
     <l n="139">Sometimes the hill submits itself a while</l>
     <l n="140">In small descents , which do its height beguile ;</l>
     <l n="141">And sometimes mounts , but so as billows play ,</l>
     <l n="142">Whose rise not hinders , but makes short , our way .</l>
     <l n="143">Your brow , which does no fear of thunder know ,</l>
     <l n="144">Sees rolling tempests vainly beat below ;</l>
     <l n="145">And , like Olympus ’ top , the impression wears</l>
     <l n="146">Of love and friendship writ in former years .</l>
     <l n="147">Yet unimpaired with labours , or with time ,</l>
     <l n="148">Your age but seems to a new youth to climb .</l>
     <l n="149">Thus heavenly bodies do our time beget ,</l>
     <l n="150">And measure change , but share no part of it .</l>
     <l n="151">And still it shall without a weight increase ,</l>
     <l n="152">Like this new-year , whose motions never cease :</l>
     <l n="153">For , since the glorious course you have begun</l>
     <l n="154">Is led by Charles , as that is by the sun ,</l>
     <l n="155">It must both weightless and immortal prove ,</l>
     <l n="156">Because the centre of it is above .</l>

   <p>SATIRE ON THE DUTCH .</p>
   <p>This Satire was , as the title informs us , written in 1662 : probably towards the latter end of the year , when Charles , having quarrelled with De Wit , then at the head of the public affairs of Holland , was endeavouring to patch up an union with France , to which kingdom he was naturally partial , against the States , whom he hated , both as a republic , and an association of vulgar merchants . This impolitic alliance did not then take place , notwithstanding the sale of Dunkirk , ( conquered by the arms of Cromwell ,) to France , for L. 400 , 000 . On the contrary , in 1665 France armed in defence of Holland . But this was contrary to the expectations and wishes of Charles ; and accordingly Dryden , in 1662 , alludes to the union of the two crowns against the States as a probable event .</p>
   <p>The verses are adapted to the comprehension of the vulgar , whom they were intended to inflame . Bold invective , and coarse raillery , supply the place of the wit and argument , with which Dryden , when the time fitted , knew so well how to arm his satire .</p>
   <p>The verses , such as they are , appeared to the author well qualified for the purpose intended ; for , when , in 1672 , his tragedy of “ Amboyna ” was brought forward , to exasperate the nation against Holland , the following verses were almost literally woven into the prologue and epilogue of that piece . See Vol . V. pp . 10 . 87 . Nevertheless , as forming a link in our author 's poetical progress , the present Editor has imitated his predecessors , in reprinting them among his satires and political pieces .</p>

    <head>TO</head>
    <head>HER ROYAL HIGHNESS</head>
    <head>THE DUCHESS OF YORK ,</head>
     <l n="1">ON THE VICTORY GAINED BY THE DUKE OVER THE DUTCH , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Duchess , here addressed , was Anne Hyde , daughter of the Earl of Clarendon , and first wife of James , Duke of York , afterwards James II . She appears to have been a woman of first-rate talents , as well as exemplary prudence . Of the last qualification she gave a singular proof , when her marriage with the Duke was declared . She had admitted James to her bed while abroad , under a solemn promise of marriage . Many endeavoured to dissuade him from completing this unequal alliance ; and that a motive , at least an apology , might be supplied for a retreat from his engagements , Lord Falmouth , Killigrew , and other courtiers , did not hesitate to boast of favours received from the lady . When the king 's regard for his minister , and James 's attachment to his betrothed wife , occasioned the confirmation of the marriage , these zealous witnesses found themselves in an unpleasing predicament , till the Duchess took an opportunity of assuring them , that she was far from harbouring the least resentment at the reports they had raised , since they believed them calculated to promote the interest of their master and her husband .<span corresp="#note79" type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>It may be presumed , that Dryden had already attached himself to the fortunes of the Duke of York , since he so early addressed the princess , whose posthumous avowal of the Catholic faith he afterwards attempted to vindicate .</p>
   <p>The victory of the 23d June , 1665 , was gained by the British fleet , commanded by the Duke of York , over the Dutch , under the famous Opdam . It was , like all naval actions between the English and the Dutch , a fierce , obstinate , and bloody conflict . The fleets met near Harwich on the 2d June ; but the Dutch declined action upon that day , from a superstitious recollection that it was the anniversary of a dreadful defeat , received from Blake and Monk in 1653 , in which they lost their famous Admiral , Von Tromp . But on the morning of the third , the fleets joined battle so near the shore , that the thunder of the combat was heard all along the English coast . York and Opdam singled each other out , and lay alongside in close action , till the Dutch vessel ( a second rate ) was blown up , and all on board perished . The Dutch fleet then dispersed and fled , losing nineteen ships sunk and taken , while the English lost only one . During this dreadful battle the Duke of York displayed the greatest personal courage . He was in the thickest of the fire , when one cannon-shot killed Lord Falmouth , Lord Muskerry , and Mr Boyle , by his side , and covered him with the gore of the most faithful and attached companions of his fortune . Yet this day , the brightest which ever shone on him , was not without a cloud . When the Dutch fleet were scattered , and an active pursuit was all that remained to the victors , Brounker , a gentleman of the Duke 's bed-chamber , commanded Sir John Harman , in the Duke 's name , to slacken sail . James was then asleep , and the flimsy pretext of not disturbing his repose was set up as a reason for this most untimely interference . The affair was never well explained . The Duke dismissed Brounker from his service , and a parliamentary investigation of his conduct took place .<span corresp="#note80" type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>But no adequate punishment was inflicted , and the nation saw , with displeasure , the fruits of a dear-bought and splendid victory lost by the unauthorized interference of an officious minion .</p>
   <p>The Duchess , as we learn , amongst other authorities , from an old libel , came down to Harwich to see her husband embark , and afterwards made the triumphant progress to the north , which is here commemorated . The splendour of her reception at Harwich is thus censured by the Satirist :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">One thrifty ferry-boat , of mother-pearl ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sufficed of old the Citherean girl ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet navies are but fopperies , when here</l>
     <l n="4">A small sea mask , and built to court your dear :</l>
     <l n="5">Three goddesses in one , Pallas for art ,</l>
     <l n="6">Venus for sport , but Juno in your heart .</l>
     <l n="7">O Duchess , if thy nuptial pomp was mean ,</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis paid with interest in thy naval scene .</l>
     <l n="9">Never did Roman Mark , within the Nile ,</l>
     <l n="10">So feast the fair Egyptian crocodile ;</l>
     <l n="11">Nor the Venetian Duke , with such a state ,</l>
     <l n="12">The Adriatic marry at that rate .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poem itself is adapted to the capacity and taste of a lady ; and , if we compare it with that which Dryden had two years before addressed to the Chancellor , it strengthens , I think , very strongly the supposition , that the old taste of extravagant and over-laboured conceits , with which the latter abounds , was a stile purposely adapted to gratify the great Statesman to whom it was addressed , whose taste must necessarily have been formed upon the ancient standard . The address , which follows , is throughout easy and complimentary , much in the stile of Waller , as appears from comparing it with that veteran bard 's poem on the same subject . Although upon a sublime subject , Dryden treats it in the light most capable of giving pleasure to a fair lady ; and the journey of the duchess to the north is proposed as a theme , nearly as important as the celebrated victory of her husband .</p>
   <p>Accordingly Dryden himself tells us , in the introductory letter to the “ Annus Mirabilis , ” that , in these lines , he only affected smoothness of measure and softness of expression ; and the verses themselves were originally introduced in that letter , to vindicate the character there given of them .</p>

    <head>ANNUS MIRABILIS ;</head>
    <head>THE</head>
    <head>YEAR OF WONDERS ,</head>
     <l n="1">1666 ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>AN HISTORICAL POEM .</p>
   <p>ANNUS MIRABILIS .</p>
   <p>This is the first poem of any length which Dryden gave to the public . Formerly he had only launched out in occasional verses , and , in some instances , on subjects of no prominent importance . He now spread a broader canvas , and prepared to depict a more extensive and magnificent scene . The various incidents of an eventful war between two powerful nations , who disputed the trident of the ocean , and the tremendous fire , which had laid London in ashes , were subjects which still continued to agitate the bosoms of his countrymen . These , therefore , he ventured to assume as the theme of his poem ; and his choice is justified by the effects which it yet produces upon the reader .</p>
   <p>There would have been no doubt , even had the author himself been silent , that he followed D'Avenant in the choice of the elegiac stanza , in which the Annus Mirabilis is composed . It is sounding and harmonious to the ear ; and perhaps Dryden still annexed to the couplet the idea of that harshness , which was so long its characteristick in the hands of our early English writers . But the four-lined stanza has also its peculiar disadvantages ; and they are admirably stated by the judicious critic , who first turned the Editor 's eyes , and probably those of many others , on the neglected poem of “ Gondibert . ” — “ The necessity of comprising a sentence within the limits of the measure , is the tyranny of Procrustes to thought . For the sake of a disagreeable uniformity , expression must constantly be cramped or extenuated . In general , the latter expedient will be practised as the easiest ; and thus both sentiment and language will be enfeebled by unmeaning expletives . "[ 83 ] It is nevertheless true , that Dryden has very seldom suffered his poem to languish . Every stanza presents us either with vivid description , or with some strong thought , which is seldom suffered to glide into tenuity . But this structure of verse has often laid him under an odd and rather unpleasing necessity , of filling up his stanza , by coupling a simile , or a moral , expressed in the two last lines , along with the fact , which had been announced in the two first . When these comments , or illustrations , however good in themselves , appear to be intruded upon the narrative or description , and not naturally to flow out of either , they must be considered as defects in composition ; and a kind of versification , which compels frequent recurrence to such expedients for filling up the measure , has a disadvantage , for which mere harmony can hardly compensate . In the passages which follow , there is produced a stiff and awkward kind of balance between the story and the poet 's reflections and illustrations .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Lawson among the foremost met his fate ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whom sea-green Sirens from the rocks lament :</l>
     <l n="3">Thus as an offering for the Grecian state ,</l>
     <l n="4">He first was killed , who first to battle went .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">To nearest ports their shattered ships repair ,</l>
     <l n="6">Where by our dreadful cannon they lay awed</l>
     <l n="7">So reverently men quit the open air ,</l>
     <l n="8">Where thunder speaks the angry gods abroad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Like hunted castors , conscious of their store ,</l>
     <l n="10">Their way-laid wealth to Norway 's coasts they bring ;</l>
     <l n="11">There first the North 's cold bosom spices bore ,</l>
     <l n="12">And winter brooded on the eastern spring .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>When , after such verses , we find one in which the author expresses a single idea so happily , as just to fill up the quatrain , the difference is immediately visible , betwixt a simile easily and naturally introduced , and stanzas made up and levelled with what a poet of those times would perhaps have ventured to call the travelled earth of versification :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And now four days the sun had seen our woes ;</l>
     <l n="2">Four nights the moon beheld the incessant fire ;</l>
     <l n="3">It seemed as if the stars more sickly rose ,</l>
     <l n="4">And farther from the feverish north retire .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Of all these difficulties our author seems to have been aware , from his preliminary epistle to Sir Robert Howard ; and it was probably the experimental conviction , that they were occasionally invincible , which induced him thenceforward to desert the quatrain ; although he has decided that stanza to be more noble , and of greater dignity , both for the sound and number , than any other verse in use among us .</p>
   <p>The turn of composition , as well as the structure of the verse , is adopted from “ Gondibert . ” But Dryden , more completely master of the English language , and a writer of much more lively imagination and expression , has , in general , greatly exceeded his master in conceiving and bringing out the far-fetched ideas and images , with which each has graced his poem . D'Avenant is often harsh and turgid , and the construction of his sentences extremely involved . Dryden has his obscure , and even unintelligible , passages ; but they arise from the extravagance of the idea , not from the want of power to express it . For example , D'Avenant says ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Near her seems crucified that lucky thief ,</l>
     <l n="2">In heaven 's dark lottery prosperous more than wise ,</l>
     <l n="3">Who groped at last by chance for heaven 's relief ,</l>
     <l n="4">And throngs undoes with hopes by one drawn prize .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We here perfectly understand the author 's meaning , through his lumbering and unpoetical expression ; but , in the following stanza , Dryden is unintelligible , because he had conceived an idea approaching to nonsense , while the words themselves are both poetical and expressive :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then we upon our globe 's last verge shall go ,</l>
     <l n="2">And view the ocean leaning on the sky ;</l>
     <l n="3">From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know ,</l>
     <l n="4">And on the lunar world securely pry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">In short , Dryden never fails in the power of elegant expression , till</l>
     <l n="6">he ventures upon something which it is impossible to express .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The love of conceit and point , that inveterate though decaying disease of the literature of the time , has not failed to infect the Annus Mirabilis . That monstrous verse , in which the extinction of the fire is described , cannot be too often quoted , both to expose the meanness of the image , and the confusion of the metaphor ; for it will be noticed , that the extinguisher , so unhappily conceived , is not even employed in its own mean office . The flames of London are first a tallow candle ; and secondly hawks , which , while pouncing on their quarry , are hooded with an extinguisher :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">An hollow crystal pyramid he takes ,</l>
     <l n="2">In firmamental waters dipt above ;</l>
     <l n="3">Of it a broad extinguisher he makes ,</l>
     <l n="4">And hoods the flames that to their quarry drove .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Passages also occur , in which , from the author 's zealous desire to be technically minute , the style becomes low and vulgar . There is no doubt , that , as Dryden has observed , the proper terms of art may be not only justly , but with the highest advantage , employed in poetry ; but such technical phrases require to be selected with great judgment : they must bear relation to some striking and important object , or they are mean and trivial ; and they must be at once generally intelligible , and more expressive in themselves than ordinary language , or they are unnecessarily obscure and pedantic . Dryden has failed in both these points , in his account of the repairs of the fleet .<span corresp="#note84" type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span>Stanza 148 , in particular , combines the faults of meanness and unnecessary obscurity , from the affected use of the dialect of the dock-yard :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Some the galled ropes with dawby marline bind ,</l>
     <l n="2">Or searcloth masts with strong tarpawling coats :</l>
     <l n="3">To try new shrouds one mounts into the wind ,</l>
     <l n="4">And one below their ease or stiffness notes .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Other examples might be produced of the faults of this remarkable poem ; but it is time to say , that they are much overbalanced by its beauties . If Dryden is sometimes obscure , from the extravagance of his imagination , or the far-fetched labour of his similes , and if his desire to use appropriate language has occasionally led him into low and affected minuteness , this poem exhibits a far greater number of instances of happy and judicious illustration , beautiful description , and sublime morality . The comparison of the secret rise of the fire of London to the obscure birth of an usurper , is doubly striking , when we consider how closely the passage may be understood to bear reference to the recent domination of the Protector .<span corresp="#note85" type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span>I will not load these preliminary observations , by inserting the whole of the striking passage , on the different manner in which the night , after the battle of the first of June , was passed on board the English and Dutch fleets ; but certainly the 71st stanza will not lose , by being an hundred times quoted :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In dreams they fearful precipices tread ;</l>
     <l n="2">Or , shipwrecked , labour to some distant shore ;</l>
     <l n="3">Or in dark churches walk among the dead ;</l>
     <l n="4">They wake with horror , and dare sleep no more .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The verses , in which Prince Rupert and his enemy are compared to a greyhound and hare , after a course so desperate as totally to exhaust both , have been always considered as exquisitely beautiful .<span corresp="#note86" type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span>The description of the Loyal London partakes of the beauties and faults which are dispersed through the poem . Nothing can be more majestic than her description , “ firing the air with her sanguine streamers , ” and “ riding upon her shadow in floating gold . ” We lament , that the weaver should have been so fascinated with his labours as to commence seaman ; and still more , that , after describing her “ roomy decks , ” and “ depth of draught , ” she should furnish no grander simile than that of</p>
   <p>—— a sea-wasp floating on the waves .</p>
   <p>More unqualified approbation may be justly afforded to the whole description of the Dutch homeward-bound fleet , captured in sight of their desired haven ; and the fine moral lessons which the poet takes the opportunity to inculcate , from so unexpected an incident . The 34th stanza has a tenderness and simplicity , which every lover of true poetry must admire :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This careful husband had been long away ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whom his chaste wife and little children mourn ;</l>
     <l n="3">Who on their fingers learned to tell the day</l>
     <l n="4">On which their father promised to return .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I will only point out to attention the beautiful and happily expressed simile of the eagle in stanzas 107 and 108 , and then , in imitation of honest John Bunyan ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">No more detain the readers in the porch ,</l>
     <l n="2">Or keep them from the day-light with a torch .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The title of Annus Mirabilis did not , according to Mr Malone , originate with Dryden ; a prose tract , so intitled , being published in 1662 .<span corresp="#note87" type="note_anchor">[ 87 ]</span>Neither was he the last that used it ; for , the learned editor of “ Predictions and Observations , collected from Mr J. Partridge 's Almanacks for 1687 and 1688 , ” has so entitled his astrological lucubrations .</p>
   <p>The Annus Mirabilis was first printed in octavo , in 1667 , the year succeeding that which was the subject of the poem . The quarto edition of 1688 , which seems very correct , has been employed in correcting that of Derrick in a few trifling instances .</p>

    <head>TO THE</head>
    <head>METROPOLIS OF GREAT-BRITAIN ,</head>

   <p>As , perhaps , I am the first who ever presented a work of this nature to the metropolis of any nation , so it is likewise consonant to justice , that he , who was to give the first example of such a dedication , should begin it with that city , which has set a pattern to all others , of true loyalty , invincible courage , and unshaken constancy . Other cities have been praised for the same virtues , but I am much deceived if any have so dearly purchased their reputation : their fame has been won them by cheaper trials than an expensive , though necessary war , a consuming pestilence , and a more consuming fire . To submit yourselves with that humility to the judgments of heaven , and , at the same time , to raise yourselves with that vigour above all human enemies ; to be combated at once from above , and from below ; to be struck down , and to triumph ,— I know not whether such trials have been ever paralleled in any nation : the resolution and successes of them never can be . Never had prince or people more mutual reason to love each other , if suffering for each other can endear affection . You have come together a pair of matchless lovers , through many difficulties ; he , through a long exile , various traverses of fortune , and the interposition of many rivals , who violently ravished and with-held you from him ; and certainly you have had your share in sufferings . But providence has cast upon you want of trade , that you might appear bountiful to your country 's necessities ; and the rest of your afflictions are not more the effects of God 's displeasure ( frequent examples of them having been in the reign of the most excellent princes ) than occasions for the manifesting of your christian and civil virtues . To you , therefore , this Year of Wonders is justly dedicated , because you have made it so ; you , who are to stand a wonder to all years and ages ; and who have built yourselves an immortal monument on your own ruins . You are now a Phœnix in her ashes , and , as far as humanity can approach , a great emblem of the suffering Deity ; but heaven never made so much piety and virtue to leave it miserable . I have heard , indeed , of some virtuous persons who have ended unfortunately , but never of any virtuous nation : Providence is engaged too deeply , when the cause becomes so general ; and I cannot imagine it has resolved that ruin of the people at home , which it has blessed abroad with such successes . I am therefore to conclude , that your sufferings are at an end ; and that one part of my poem has not been more an history of your destruction , than the other a prophecy of your restoration . The accomplishment of which happiness , as it is the wish of all true Englishmen , so is it by none more passionately desired , than by</p>

   <p>HON . SIR ROBERT HOWARD .<span corresp="#note88" type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span></p>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I am so many ways obliged to you , and so little able to return your favours , that , like those who owe too much , I can only live by getting farther into your debt . You have not only been careful of my fortune , which was the effect of your nobleness , but you have been solicitous of my reputation , which is that of your kindness . It is not long since I gave you the trouble of perusing a play for me ,<span corresp="#note89" type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span>and now , instead of an acknowledgment , I have given you a greater , in the correction of a poem . But since you are to bear this persecution , I will at least give you the encouragement of a martyr ,— you could never suffer in a nobler cause ; for I have chosen the most heroic subject , which any poet could desire . I have taken upon me to describe the motives , the beginning , progress , and successes , of a most just and necessary war ; in it , the care , management , and prudence of our king ; the conduct and valour of a royal admiral , and of two incomparable generals ; the invincible courage of our captains and seamen ; and three glorious victories , the result of all . After this , I have , in the Fire , the most deplorable , but withal the greatest , argument that can be imagined ; the destruction being so swift , so sudden , so vast and miserable , as nothing can parallel in story . The former part of this poem , relating to the war , is but a due expiation for my not serving my king and country in it . All gentlemen are almost obliged to it ; and I know no reason we should give that advantage to the commonalty of England , to be foremost in brave actions , which the nobles of France would never suffer in their peasants . I should not have written this but to a person , who has been ever forward to appear in all employments , whither his honour and generosity have called him . The latter part of my poem , which describes the Fire , I owe , first , to the piety and fatherly affection of our monarch to his suffering subjects ; and , in the second place , to the courage , loyalty , and magnanimity of the city ; both which were so conspicuous , that I have wanted words to celebrate them as they deserve . I have called my poem historical , not epic , though both the actions and actors are as much heroic as any poem can contain . But , since the action is not properly one , nor that accomplished in the last successes , I have judged it too bold a title for a few stanzas , which are little more in number than a single Iliad , or the longest of the Æneids . For this reason , ( I mean not of length , but broken action , tied too severely to the laws of history ) I am apt to agree with those , who rank Lucan rather among historians in verse , than Epic poets ; in whose room , if I am not deceived , Silius Italicus , though a worse writer , may more justly be admitted . I have chosen to write my poem in quatrains , or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme , because I have ever judged them more noble , and of greater dignity , both for the sound and number , than any other verse in use amongst us ; in which I am sure I have your approbation . The learned languages have certainly a great advantage of us , in not being tied to the slavery of any rhyme ; and were less constrained in the quantity of every syllable , which they might vary with spondees or dactyls , besides so many other helps of grammatical figures , for the lengthening or abbreviation of them , than the modern are in the close of that one syllable , which often confines , and more often corrupts , the sense of all the rest . But in this necessity of our rhymes , I have always found the couplet verse most easy , ( though not so proper for this occasion ,) for there the work is sooner at an end , every two lines concluding the labour of the poet ; but in quatrains he is to carry it farther on , and not only so , but to bear along in his head the troublesome sense of four lines together . For , those , who write correctly in this kind , must needs acknowledge , that the last line of the stanza is to be considered in the composition of the first . Neither can we give ourselves the liberty of making any part of a verse for the sake of rhyme , or concluding with a word which is not current English , or using the variety of female rhymes ,<span corresp="#note90" type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span>all which our fathers practised ; and for the female rhymes , they are still in use amongst other nations ; with the Italian in every line , with the Spaniard promiscuously , with the French alternately , as those who have read the Alaric , the Pucelle , or any of their later poems , will agree with me . And besides this , they write in Alexandrines , or verses of six feet ; such as , amongst us , is the old translation of Homer by Chapman :[ 91 ] all which , by lengthening of their chain , makes the sphere of their activity the larger .</p>
   <p>I have dwelt too long upon the choice of my stanza , which you may remember is much better defended in the preface to “ Gondibert ; ” and therefore I will hasten to acquaint you with my endeavours in the writing . In general I will only say , I have never yet seen the description of any naval fight in the proper terms which are used at sea ; and if there be any such , in another language , as that of Lucan in the third of his Pharsalia , yet I could not avail myself of it in the English ; the terms of art in every tongue bearing more of the idiom of it than any other words . We hear indeed among our poets , of the thundering of guns , the smoke , the disorder , and the slaughter ; but all these are common notions . And certainly , as those , who in a logical dispute keep in general terms , would hide a fallacy ; so those , who do it in any poetical description , would veil their ignorance :[ 92 ]</p>

     <l n="1">Descriptas servare vices , operumque colores ,</l>
     <l n="2">Cur ego , si nequeo ignoroque , poeta salutor ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For my own part , if I had little knowledge of the sea , yet I have thought it no shame to learn ; and if I have made some few mistakes , it is only , as you can bear me witness , because I have wanted opportunity to correct them ; the whole poem being first written , and now sent you from a place , where I have not so much as the converse of any seaman . Yet though the trouble I had in writing it was great , it was more than recompensed by the pleasure . I found myself so warm in celebrating the praises of military men , two such especially as the prince and general , that it is no wonder if they inspired me with thoughts above my ordinary level . And I am well satisfied , that , as they are incomparably the best subject I ever had , excepting only the royal family , so also , that this I have written of them is much better than what I have performed on any other . I have been forced to help out other arguments , but this has been bountiful to me ; they have been low and barren of praise ,<span corresp="#note93" type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span>and I have exalted them , and made them fruitful ; but here — Omnia sponte suà reddit justissima tellus . I have had a large , a fair , and a pleasant field ; so fertile , that , without my cultivating , it has given me two harvests in a summer , and in both oppressed the reaper . All other greatness in subjects is only counterfeit ; it will not endure the test of danger ; the greatness of arms is only real . Other greatness burdens a nation with its weight ; this supports it with its strength . And as it is the happiness of the age , so it is the peculiar goodness of the best of kings , that we may praise his subjects without offending him . Doubtless it proceeds from a just confidence of his own virtue , which the lustre of no other can be so great as to darken in him ; for the good or the valiant are never safely praised under a bad or a degenerate prince .</p>
   <p>But to return from this digression to a farther account of my poem ; I must crave leave to tell you , that as I have endeavoured to adorn it with noble thoughts , so much more to express those thoughts with elocution . The composition of all poems is , or ought to be , of wit ;<span corresp="#note94" type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>and wit in the poet , or wit-writing , ( if you will give me leave to use a school-distinction ) is no other than the faculty of imagination in the writer , which , like a nimble spaniel , beats over and ranges through the field of memory , ‘ till it springs the quarry it hunted after ; or , without metaphor , which searches over all the memory for the species or ideas of those things , which it designs to represent . Wit written is that which is well defined , the happy result of thought , or product of imagination . But to proceed from wit , in the general notion of it , to the proper wit of an Heroic or Historical Poem , I judge it chiefly to consist in the delightful imagining of persons , actions , passions , or things . It is not the jerk or sting of an epigram , nor the seeming contradiction of a poor antithesis , ( the delight of an ill-judging audience in a play of rhyme ,) nor the gingle of a more poor paronomasia ;<span corresp="#note95" type="note_anchor">[ 95 ]</span>neither is it so much the morality of a grave sentence , affected by Lucan , but more sparingly used by Virgil ; but it is some lively and apt description , dressed in such colours of speech , that it sets before your eyes the absent object , as perfectly , and more delightfully than nature . So then the first happiness of the poet 's imagination is properly invention , or finding of the thought ; the second is fancy , or the variation , deriving , or moulding , of that thought , as the judgment represents it proper to the subject ; the third is elocution , or the art of clothing and adorning that thought , so found and varied , in apt , significant , and sounding words . The quickness of the imagination is seen in the invention , the fertility in the fancy , and the accuracy in the expression . For the two first of these , Ovid is famous amongst the poets ; for the latter , Virgil . Ovid images more often the movements and affections of the mind , either combating between two contrary passions , or extremely discomposed by one . His words therefore are the least part of his care ; for he pictures nature in disorder , with which the study and choice of words is inconsistent . This is the proper wit of dialogue or discourse , and consequently of the drama , where all that is said is supposed to be the effect of sudden thought ; which , though it excludes not the quickness of wit in repartees , yet admits not a too curious election of words , too frequent allusions , or use of tropes , or , in fine , any thing that shews remoteness of thought , or labour in the writer . On the other side , Virgil speaks not so often to us in the person of another , like Ovid , but in his own : he relates almost all things as from himself , and thereby gains more liberty than the other , to express his thoughts with all the graces of elocution , to write more figuratively , and to confess as well the labour as the force of his imagination . Though he describes his Dido well and naturally , in the violence of her passions , yet he must yield in that to the Myrrha , the Biblis , the Althæa , of Ovid ; for , as great an admirer of him as I am , I must acknowledge , that if I see not more of their souls than I see of Dido 's , at least I have a greater concernment for them : and that convinces me , that Ovid has touched those tender strokes more delicately than Virgil could . But when action or persons are to be described , when any such image is to be set before us , how bold , how masterly , are the strokes of Virgil ! We see the objects he presents us with in their native figures , in their proper motions ; but so we see them , as our own eyes could never have beheld them so beautiful in themselves . We see the soul of the poet , like that universal one of which he speaks , informing and moving through all his pictures :</p>

   <p>—— —— lumenque juventæ Purpureum , &amp; lætos oculis afflârat honores : Quale manus addunt ebori decus , aut ubi flavo Argentum , Pariusve lapis , circundatur auro .</p>
   <p>See his Tempest , his Funeral Sports , his Combat of Turnus and Æneas : and in his “ Georgics , ” which I esteem the divinest part of all his writings , the Plague , the Country , the Battle of the Bulls , the labour of the Bees ; and those many other excellent images of nature , most of which are neither great in themselves , nor have any natural ornament to bear them up ; but the words wherewith he describes them are so excellent , that it might be well applied to him , which was said by Ovid , Materium superabat opus : the very sound of his words has often somewhat that is connatural to the subject ; and while we read him , we sit , as in a play , beholding the scenes of what he represents . To perform this , he made frequent use of tropes , which you know change the nature of a known word , by applying it to some other signification ; and this is it which Horace means in his Epistle to the Piso 's :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Dixeris egregiè , notum si callida verbum</l>
     <l n="2">Reddiderit junctura novum .——</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But I am sensible I have presumed too far to entertain you with a rude discourse of that art , which you both know so well , and put into practice with so much happiness . Yet before I leave Virgil , I must own the vanity to tell you , and by you the world , that he has been my master in this poem . I have followed him every where , I know not with what success , but I am sure with diligence enough ; my images are many of them copied from him , and the rest are imitations of him . My expressions also are as near as the idioms of the two languages would admit of in translation . And this , sir , I have done with that boldness , for which I will stand accountable to any of our little critics , who , perhaps , are no better acquainted with him than I am . Upon your first perusal of this poem , you have taken notice of some words , which I have innovated ( if it be too bold for me to say refined ) upon his Latin ; which , as I offer not to introduce into English prose , so I hope they are neither improper , nor altogether inelegant in verse ; and , in this , Horace will again defend me :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Et nova , fictaque nuper , habebunt verba fidem , si</l>
     <l n="2">Græco fonte cadunt , parcè detorta .——</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The inference is exceeding plain ; for , if a Roman poet might have liberty to coin a word , supposing only that it was derived from the Greek , was put into a Latin termination , and that he used this liberty but seldom , and with modesty ; how much more justly may I challenge that privilege to do it with the same prerequisites , from the best and most judicious of Latin writers ? In some places , where either the fancy or the words were his , or any other 's , I have noted it in the margin , that I might not seem a plagiary ;<span corresp="#note96" type="note_anchor">[ 96 ]</span>in others I have neglected it , to avoid as well tediousness , as the affectation of doing it too often . Such descriptions or images well wrought , which I promise not for mine , are , as I have said , the adequate delight of heroic poesy ; for they beget admiration , which is its proper object ; as the images of the burlesque , which is contrary to this , by the same reason beget laughter : for , the one shews nature beautified , as in the picture of a fair woman , which we all admire ; the other shews her deformed , as in that of a lazar , or of a fool with distorted face and antique gestures , at which we cannot forbear to laugh , because it is a deviation from nature . But though the same images serve equally for the Epic poesy , and for the Historic and Panegyric , which are branches of it , yet a several sort of sculpture is to be used in them . If some of them are to be like those of Juvenal , stantes in curribus Æmiliani , heroes drawn in their triumphal chariots , and in their full proportion ; others are to be like that of Virgil , spirantia mollius æra : there is somewhat more of softness and tenderness to be shewn in them . You will soon find I write not this without concern . Some , who have seen a paper of verses , which I wrote last year to her highness the Duchess , have accused them of that only thing I could defend in them . They said , I did humi serpere ,— that I wanted not only height of fancy , but dignity of words , to set it off . I might well answer with that of Horace , Nunc non erat his locus ; I knew I addressed them to a lady , and accordingly I affected the softness of expression , and the smoothness of measure , rather than the height of thought ; and in what I did endeavour , it is no vanity to say I have succeeded . I detest arrogance ; but there is some difference betwixt that and a just defence . But I will not farther bribe your candour , or the reader 's . I leave them to speak for me ; and , if they can , to make out that character , not pretending to a greater , which I have given them .<span corresp="#note97" type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span></p>
   <p>And now , sir , it is time I should relieve you from the tedious length of this account . You have better and more profitable employment for your hours , and I wrong the public to detain you longer . In conclusion , I must leave my poem to you with all its faults , which I hope to find fewer in the printing by your emendations . I know you are not of the number of those , of whom the younger Pliny speaks ; Nec sunt parum multi , qui carpere amicos suos judicium vocant : I am rather too secure of you on that side . Your candour in pardoning my errors may make you more remiss in correcting them ; if you will not withal consider , that they come into the world with your approbation , and through your hands . I beg from you the greatest favour you can confer upon an absent person , since I repose upon your management what is dearest to me , my fame and reputation ; and therefore I hope it will stir you up to make my poem fairer by many of your blots : if not , you know the story of the gamester who married the rich man 's daughter , and when her father denied the portion , christened all the children by his sirname , that if , in conclusion , they must beg , they should do so by one name , as well as by the other . But , since the reproach of my faults will light on you , it is but reason I should do you that justice to the readers , to let them know , that , if there be any thing tolerable in this poem , they owe the argument to your choice , the writing to your encouragement , the correction to your judgment , and the care of it to your friendship , to which he must ever acknowledge himself to owe all things , who is ,</p>

   <p>The jealousy of commerce between Holland and England recommended a Dutch war to the nation ; while the king , insensible to the many advances made him by the States , cherished a hearty detestation at their mode of government , and the manners of their people in general . Some of the regicides had sought shelter in Holland ; and it was only by the uncommon alertness of Downes , the British ambassador , that they were seized and sent to England . Nay , De Witt , and other leaders in the States , kept up a secret correspondence with Ludlow , and the other banished republican English , in hopes that their party might yet find work for Charles in his own kingdom . Meanwhile , they extended beyond measure their personal deference for Charles ; willing to avoid a war , which , in any event , must be prejudicial to their commerce , and which , from the valour which the English had displayed in 1653 , might probably be unfortunate . But the interest of the East Indian and African Companies , both of which were highly favoured by Charles in the beginning of his reign , and the unatoned injuries which they had sustained from the Dutch , were a sufficient counterpoise to every pacific overture on the part of Holland .</p>

   <p>France , a nation ever remarkable for seeing , almost intuitively , her own interest , was not willing that the domineering spirit of Cromwell should revive under the restored monarchy of England . Richelieu had been forced to comply , to a certain extent , with the rash , and often impolitic , but always energetic and daring , schemes of the Protector , endeavouring , at the same time , to make them subservient to his own purposes . But when there was no danger of England uniting with Spain and Holland against France , it was much more the interest of that kingdom , that the two great naval powers should waste their strength in mutual warfare , or even that France should assist the weaker , than that she should join with the stronger , to oppress the other entirely . Besides , the French faction , with De Witt at their head , was now paramount in Holland ; and the indirect effect of any signal success of the English must be the restoration of the house of Orange , so closely allied to Charles II ., and the hereditary enemy of France , to the dignity of the office of Stadtholder ; an office , which , with the family who held it , has been uniformly respected or degraded , as the English or French faction prevailed in the United Provinces . The French court had therefore various reasons for making the Dutch “ lords by sea , ” since they could give them “ law by land ; ” and these finally weighed so deeply , as to lead them to take a part , though but a cold one , against Britain in this very war .</p>
   <p>The Spanish provinces in the Netherlands had always been the object of French cupidity ; and , according to count D'Estrade , a scheme was now formed for dividing them between France and Holland ; which , however , the French court took great and successful care to conceal from the party who were to be sufferers . This policy Dryden has termed , “ rocking the cradle of the babe of Spain . ”</p>

   <p>“ As it is on all hands confessed , that never any English , perhaps I might say , any prince , without distinction of countries , understood maritime affairs so well as Charles II . did ; so it cannot surprise any intelligent reader , when we assert , that the English navy received very great advantages from his skill and care in matters of this nature . It must indeed be allowed , that he found the fleet , at his restoration , in an excellent situation , and abundance of very able men employed therein ; and it must likewise be confessed , to the honour of his government , that he preserved them in their several posts , without any respect to party , which , without question , contributed not a little to the increase of our naval power . How intent he was , for the first ten years of his reign , in promoting whatever had a tendency this way , appears from all the candid histories of those times , from the collections of orders , and other public papers relating to the direction of the navy while the duke of York was admiral , published of late ;<span corresp="#note203" type="note_anchor">[ 203 ]</span>and , in a short and narrow compass , from the speech made by the lord-keeper Bridgeman , who affirmed , that , from 1660 to 1670 , the charge of the navy had never amounted to less than 500 , 000l . a year . ” — Lives of the Admirals , Vol .

Comets , it is well known , were in extremely bad repute among the astrologers of this period .

   <p>This battle , one of the most decisive and glorious fought during the war , our author had already celebrated in the verses to the Duchess , immediately preceding this poem ; to which , and to the notes , the reader is referred . The famous Dutch admiral Opdam , in his flag-ship , the Eintracht , blew up , while closely engaged with the duke of York in the Royal Charles . Shortly afterwards , four or five Dutch vessels became unmanageable , fell on board of each other , and were all burned by a single fire-ship . Three others were destroyed in the same condition , and by the same means . Two Dutch vice-admirals were killed , whose ships , bearing away , drew many out of the line , so that Van Tromp , who fought gallantly , had , out of a hundred and three ships , only thirty left , to continue a retreating action . This victory was gained on the 3d . June , 1665 .</p>

     <l n="2">St. 20. p. 108 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Sir John Lawson , the gallant seaman here mentioned , rose from a mean station in the navy , to be an admiral under the Parliament . He distinguished himself in the Dutch war of 1653 , by the incredible damage which the flying squadron he commanded did to the commerce of the States . He entered afterwards into some cabals with the fifth-monarchy-men , a set of pretended saints , who would hear of nothing but a theocracy . It does not appear , whether , on the part of Lawson , this was an alliance of policy or principle ; but it cost the admiral an imprisonment under the vigilant administration of Cromwell . He was set at liberty , and declared by the Parliament vice-admiral of the Channel fleet , which he induced by his influence to declare for the Restoration . The admiral was rewarded for this service by the honour of knighthood , and high trust from his sovereign . In the great battle off Loestoff , sir John Lawson met the glorious death which Dryden has here commemorated . He was rear-admiral to the duke of York , and maintained his high character for valour and seaman-ship till late in the action , when he received a musket-shot in the knee , and by its effects was prevented from enjoying the victory , to which he had greatly contributed . He died a few days after the action , in full enjoyment of his country 's triumph , and his own glory .</p>

   <p>The Dutch occasionally conducted their naval expeditions with great and insolent affectation of superiority . Upon one occasion their admiral sailed with a broom at his main-top-gallant-mast , to signify , he had swept the narrow seas of the English . Opdam , as already mentioned , blew up , while along side of the Duke of York . Some imputed this accident to the revenge of a negro slave ; others , to some carelessness in the distribution of the ammunition .</p>

   <p>This alludes to an action variously judged of , and very much noted at the period . The Turkey and East India fleets of Holland , very richly laden , and consisting , according to D'Estrades , of ten Indiamen , seventeen ships from Smyrna , and twenty-eight from other ports , valued at 25 millions of livres , having gone north about to avoid encountering the English , and finding , that they could not with safety attempt to get into their own harbours even by that circuitous route , had taken shelter in the bay of Bergen . The earl of Sandwich , who now commanded the fleet , the duke of York having gone ashore , dispatched sir Thomas Tydiman with a squadron to attack them . It is said , that the king of Denmark privately encouraged this attempt , on condition of sharing the wealthy spoils of the Hollanders , and that messengers were actually dispatched by him , bearing orders to the governor of Bergen to afford them no protection . If this was so , the English admiral , after lying three days inactive before the bay , ruined the design by a premature attack upon the fleet ere the royal mandate had arrived , when the Danish governor took the natural and generous course of vindicating the neutrality of his harbour , permitted the Dutch to fortify themselves by erecting batteries on shore , and supported them by the fire from the castle , which covered the bay . Notwithstanding this interference of the Danes , which seems to have been unexpected , the English admiral bore into the bay , commenced the assault with great fury , and continued it until a contrary wind , joined to the brave opposition of the Dutch and Danes , obliged him to desist from the attempt . On this subject , we may , I think , conclude , that the attack was premature , if the admiral had good reason to expect the assistance of Denmark , but too long delayed if he was to depend on his own strength . The scheme is thus satirized by Rochester :</p>

   <p>The famous De Witt set sail at the head of the Dutch fleet in person , to relieve the ships , which were still detained in Bergen by the Danish governor . It seems they had found a new enemy in their old protector , who refused to let them sail , until they paid a ransom of 100 , 000 crowns . The arrival of De Witt made Alfeldt change his note , and the persecuted Hollanders sailed from their harbour of dubious refuge , at no heavier a composition , than leaving the cannon , which they had sent ashore , to mount the land batteries against the English . But in their return , De Witt 's large fleet and valuable cargo were scattered in a storm : the vice-admiral , and rear-admiral of the East India fleet , ships of immense value , with several merchant vessels and men of war , were picked up by the English squadrons , and so furnished the tribute which Dryden alludes to in this and the following verses .</p>

He burst into the United States , at the head of a mercenary army of 20 , 000 men . With this force , he over-ran the province of Overyssell , where his soldiers distinguished themselves less by military valour , than by an exorbitant licence , rapine , and cruelty , which did little honour to their reverend general . But his progress was speedily checked by a French army ; and , as the elector of Brandenburgh threatened his states with invasion , he found himself compelled to make a separate peace , assigning as a reason , amongst others , the irregularity of remitting the promised subsidies from England . This is rather inconsistent with Dryden 's charge , that “ money given , had tempted him to ill ; ” but in such cases , the party subsidized usually thinks he has received too little for his service , as those , who pay him , are apt to suppose he has had too much . Sir William Temple was dispatched , to prevent the Bishop from making the separate peace here complained of , but he did not arrive till after it had been signed .</p>

   <p>France , unwilling to expose her infant navy in a war with England , long endeavoured to mediate between the two great maritime states , and did not undertake to support the Dutch in then perilous conflict , until all means of negociation had been exhausted , and the tottering state of Holland rendered immediate aid necessary . About the same time , Denmark , after much vacillating and double-handed policy , at length openly united with France and Holland , against England . The French declaration of war was made in January 1665-6 , and that of Denmark soon afterwards .</p>

   <p>By the French declaration of war , all intercourse was prohibited between the belligerent nations , and the subjects of England were ordered to leave France . But , in the English counter-declaration , this usual prohibitory clause was qualified by the king 's declaration , “ That all such of the French or Dutch nation remaining in his dominions , as should demean themselves dutifully , without corresponding with his enemies , should be safe in their persons and estates , and free from all molestation and trouble ; ” and further the king declared , “ That if any of the French or Low Country subjects upon any reason should come into his kingdoms , they should be all protected in their persons and estates , and especially those of the reformed religion , whose interest should ever be particularly owned by him . ” — RALPH 'S History .

   <p>This beautiful and appropriate simile is applied to the liberal supply , voted by the House of Commons , mentioned in the address to the king , at the prorogation in 1665 . After reminding the king of their engagement , to assist him with their lives and fortunes against the Dutch , the address proceeds : “ The English man useth to speak as he writes , and the English parliament , to speak as they think . No security on earth can be greater than the engagement of your two houses of parliament . Sed quid verba audiam , dum facta videam ! As a demonstration of their fidelity , I am commanded to present unto your Majesty this bill , whereby they have given into your Majesty twelve hundred and fifty thousand pounds , to be levied in two years , beginning from Christmas next , by quarterly payments , added to the former royal aid . And , that your Majesty 's occasions may be supplied with ready money , we have , by the bill , prepared an undoubted security for all such persons as shall bring their monies unto the public bank of the Exchequer . As the rivers do naturally empty themselves unto the sea , so we hope the veins of gold and silver in this nation will plentifully run into this ocean , for the maintenance of your Majesty 's just sovereignty of the seas . ” It is possible , that the quaint expressions , contained in the last sentence , suggested to Dryden the simile , which so far excels that of the speaker .</p>

   <p>The Duke of York being the heir apparent of the crown , it was not judged proper that he should expose himself in a second sea-fight , likely to prove as bloody and dangerous as that of the 3d June 1664 . Prince Rupert and the Duke of Albemarle were appointed to the command of the grand fleet , in the absence of the Earl of Sandwich , who was then absent , as ambassador in Spain . These two great men had neither of them been bred to the sea . Prince Rupert was well known by the distinguished part which he had taken for his uncle , Charles I ., in the great civil war . When the royal cause became untenable on land , he long endeavoured to maintain it by sea , assuming for that purpose the command of the fleet , which had revolted from the Parliament to the Prince of Wales . The Prince did not relinquish his war against the Commonwealth , and their Spanish allies , until his whole fleet had been destroyed , by severe service and tempests . At the period of the Dutch war , age , and a long train of misfortunes , had chastened the original fire of his temper , and taught him that prudence , which he wanted in the civil wars ; when , with his impetuous but ill-disciplined cavalry , he usually bore down all before him , but vanished from the field in pursuit of the vanquished , leaving his less successful friends exposed without support . In other respects , he was fitted for a great commander , both by his natural talents and acquired endowments , and was a great favourite with the nation , because , though a foreigner , he bore a heart truly English .</p>
   <p>George Monk , Duke of Albemarle , the restorer of English monarchy , united in his person some very different qualities . With a steady , reserved , and even tardy manner , he was in action fierce and daring to the last degree ; adopting the most desperate course , with the air and manner of the most cool deliberation . He had signalized himself against the Dutch , during the war of the commonwealth , being in the chief command of the fleet , when they received the dreadful defeat in 1653 , to which our poet alludes in the following lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The Duke beheld , like Scipio , with disdain</l>
     <l n="2">The Carthage which he ruined rise once more ;</l>
     <l n="3">And shook aloft the fasces of the main ,</l>
     <l n="4">To fright those slaves with what they fell before .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Duke accepted the joint command with Prince Rupert , in 1665 , much against the advice of his friends , who accounted it rash in him to stake upon the issue of a battle the well-earned fame which he had acquired by signal successes in war , and by accomplishing a mighty revolution without bloodshed . But he resolved to exert his talents once more for his country in this trying crisis ; a circumstance highly gratifying to the seamen , who crowded to man the fleet , saying , they were sure , “ Honest George would see them well fed and duly paid ; ” a compliment more honourable than many of more courtly expression .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>When Prince Rupert and Albemarle were about to sail from the Downs , they received advice from the king , that the French had fitted out a strong squadron to join with the Dutch fleet , accompanied by a positive order , that Prince Rupert , with seventy men of war , should sail in quest of the French , and fight them before the intended junction . This order occasioned the separation of the fleet ; a circumstance , which , as the intelligence concerning the supposed French squadron was totally false , occasioned a heavy , and , but for the bravery of Albemarle , an overwhelming disaster . On the first of June , the Duke descried the Dutch fleet , consisting of seventy six sail , under the famous De Ruyter , whereas he himself had not above fifty . After calling a council of war , in which it was agreed in spite of all odds to engage the enemy , the Duke began the battle , which was continued with incredible fury during that whole day . The event will be found in the ensuing notes .</p>

   <p>The daring spirit of Monk was not more conspicuous at any period of his adventurous life than in this grand and desperate action . Mulgrave avers he saw him charge a pocket-pistol , with the desperate design of firing it into the powder-room , if he should be reduced to extremity . In the course of the action , a chain-shot took away part of his breeches , without disconcerting the steady countenance of the wearer .<span corresp="#note206" type="note_anchor">[ 206 ]</span>Having made a sudden tack to avoid a sand bank , his ship carried away her top-mast , so that he was compelled to lie bye for two or three hours to repair that damage , in the face of the enemy .</p>

   <p>Fire-ships , now only employed against fleets in harbour , and seldom even then , were at this time used during every great naval engagement . The Dutch wars , especially , were distinguished by the frequent use of these dreadful engines of destruction on both sides . The last instance , I believe , of their being employed in open sea in the British service , occurred in the engagement of Matthews and Lestock in the Mediterranean , where they did little execution . The reason of their disuse appears to be , that modern fleets consist of a few large vessels , which easily communicate by signal , and are little apt to fall into such confusion as that fire-ships can approach them with safety , and with any chance of effect . In the 17th century , fleets consisted of a very great number of comparatively small vessels , sometimes a hundred and upwards , which , from the imperfect nature of their signals , were perpetually getting into disorder , and affording opportunities for the fire-ships to act with all their fearful consequences . In the battle of Southwold Bay , in 1672 , the gallant Earl of Sandwich , in his fine ship the Royal James , after sinking three fire-ships , was burned by a fourth ; and the contest of the Harry with three fire-ships , in this very battle , will be found in a subsequent note .</p>

   <p>The English , upon the 3d of June , seemed to have nothing left them save the glory of a desperate defence , when , about noon , a third fleet was descried , crowding every sail to the assistance of the vanquished English , or to complete the triumph of the victorious Hollanders . It might have been the French squadron under the Duke of Beaufort , and the naval power of England was ruined for ever . Albemarle , however , bore boldly down towards the advancing strangers , and , with inexpressible sensations , discovered Prince Rupert , with the white squadron of England , hastening to his relief . Betwixt the fleets of Albemarle and Rupert lay some dangerous shoals , noticed by Dryden in Stanza 114 . On one of these , called the Galloper , Admiral Sir George Ayscue was so unfortunate as to strand his vessel , the Royal Prince , one of the largest in the fleet , and forced by his own seamen to strike his flag . He was made prisoner by the Dutch , who burned his ship , and , after leading him in a sort of triumph through various parts of the United Provinces , at length imprisoned him in the castle of Louverstein . Albemarle observing the cause of this disaster , and that the Dutch had sent a squadron of their fleet to the edge of the sands , as if to provoke the Prince , acquainted him by signal and message , that he should by no means bear up against that squadron , there being a dangerous sand between them ; and that the appearance of the Dutch in that place was to tempt him into the toil .

   <p>The poet is here more modest than the court of England , who claimed an absolute victory . Ralph says , with some justice , that “ to recount the precise issue of this unparalleled engagement , and ascertain the loss on either side , seems to be alike impossible . Both nations claimed the honour of the victory , and both affronted the Common Father of the Universe with their impious acknowledgments , when they ought to have approached Him in sackcloth and ashes , for having wantonly sacrificed so many innocent , gallant , and meritorious men , in a dispute that common sense , and common honesty , might have adjusted in half an hour . ” History , Vol . I. p. 132 . De Witt himself , the sworn foe of England , bore the following remarkable testimony to the gallantry of her seamen : “ If the English were beat , their defeat did them more honour than all their former victories . No fleet but theirs could , after the first day 's fight , have been brought to engage again . English men may be killed , English ships may be burned , but English courage is invincible . ” Quoted , in the “ Lives of the Admirals , ” from a MS. history by Wicquefort .</p>

It was this rooted and inveterate belief which caused so many to give faith to the fable of alchemy .

With a squadron of eight or nine ships , he attacked the Dutch homeward-bound Smyrna fleet , near Cadiz ; consisting of forty merchant vessels , many of which were in these days capable of a stout resistance , and a convoy of four ships of war . Allen defeated them totally , killed their commodore , Brackel , took or sunk four of their richest ships , and drove the rest into the bay of Cadiz .

   <p>Sir Robert Holmes , rear-admiral of the White , is called the General 's Achates , from the eager fidelity with which he supported Albemarle . The injuries which the African company sustained from the Dutch , and particularly their taking Cape Corfe Castle , had occasioned Sir Robert Holmes ’ being dispatched to the coast of Guinea in 1661 , for the purpose of making reprisals . Having done them some damage on this visit , he returned for the same purpose in 1663 ; when he took Goree , and the Dutch merchant-men lying there , of whom he made prize , though the nations were not actually at war . He was repulsed from St George Del Mina , the chief of the Dutch forts on the coast of Africa , but was successful in taking Cape Corfe , the principal object of his voyage . He also took from the Dutch a colony in North America , called Nova Belgia , and bestowed on it the present name of New York . The Dutch preferred a heavy complaint against Holmes , for these warlike aggressions . But it would appear , that , if he had exceeded his instructions , he had not disobliged those by whom they were given ; for , although he was committed to the Tower , he was speedily liberated , upon pleading , that he had found , on board a Dutch prize , instructions to seize the English fort at Coromantin .</p>

   <p>Sir Edward Spragge , knighted by King Charles , for his gallant behaviour on the 3d of June 1665 , was one of the best and bravest officers whom the English navy ( Leonum Nutrix ) has ever produced . He distinguished himself in the battle of four days , already celebrated ; and in that of the 25th of July , which Dryden is proceeding to detail , he carried a flag under Sir Jeremiah Smith , admiral of the Blue . The brunt of the battle fell upon this division , because , itself the weakest , it was encountered by that of Van Tromp , the strongest and best manned squadron of the enemy . Spragge afterwards distinguished himself by defending Sheerness , and by chastising the Algerines . But the last scene of his life crowned all his naval achievements . In the battle of the 11th of August 1672 , Tromp and he engaged like personal enemies , so that the conflict resembled less a chance rencontre in the confusion of battle , than a fixed and appointed duel between these admirals . Both were forced to shift their flag aboard other vessels , and instantly renewed with the utmost fury their individual contest . In shifting his flag for the second time , a chance cannon-ball pierced Sir Edward Spragge 's barge , and that gallant admiral was drowned , to the grief , it is said , of Tromp , his generous enemy . He left behind him , according to the account both of friends and foes , the character of one of the bravest men and best commanders who ever fought at sea ; nor was he less lamented by his friends on shore , for those civilized manners , and that gentle disposition , which almost always attend enlightened valour .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>This alludes to an exploit of Sir John Harman , who commanded the Henry in the four days combat . He belonged to the Blue squadron , which broke through the Dutch fleet ; but , the Swiftsure and Essex being taken , his single vessel had great part of the Zealand division to contend with .— “ His ship being disabled , the Dutch Admiral , Evertz , called to Sir John , and offered him quarter , who answered , ‘ No , sir , it is not come to that yet , ’ and immediately discharged a broadside ; by which Evertz was killed , and several of his ships damaged , which so discouraged their captains , that they quitted the Henry , and sent three fire-ships to burn her . The first grappled on her starboard quarters , and there began to arise so thick a smoke , that it was impossible to perceive where the irons were fixed . At last , when the ship began to blaze , the boatswain of the Henry threw himself on board of it , discovered , and removed the grappling irons , and in the same instant , jumped on board his own ship . He had scarce done this , before another fire-ship was fixed on the larboard ; this did its business so effectually , that the sails were quickly on fire , which frightened the chaplain and fifty men over board . Upon this , Sir John drew his sword , and threatened to kill any man who should attempt to provide for his own safety , by leaving the ship . This obliged them to endeavour to put out the fire , which in a short time they did ; but the cordage being burned , the crossbeam fell down , and broke Sir John 's leg ; at which instant , the third fire-ship bore down , but four pieces of cannon , laden with chain-shot , disabled her . So that , after all , Sir John brought his ship into Harwich , where he repaired her as well as he could ; and , notwithstanding his broken leg , put to sea again to seek the Dutch . "[ 207 ]</p>

   <p>Sir Frescheville Hollis , mentioned in this verse , was the son of Frescheville Hollis , of Grimsby , by his second wife , Mrs Elizabeth Molesworth . His father signalized himself in the civil wars , as appears from a sign manual of Charles II ., dated Jersey , December 4th , 1649 , authorising him to bear , or , two piles gules , quarterly , with his paternal coat , and setting forth ,— that in parliament he strenuously asserted the king 's prerogative ; and , being colonel of a regiment in time of the rebellion , behaved with exemplary valour against the rebels , in the several battles of Kenton , Banbury , Brantford , Newark , Atherton , Bradford , and Newbury ; and when the rebels had possessed themselves of the chief places of England , he with no less fortitude engaged with those that were besieged by them in Colchester .</p>
   <p>How Sir Frescheville Hollis ’ mother merited the title of a muse , or by what writings he signalised himself , I am really ignorant . There were few men of quality who did not at this time aspire to something of a literary character . As the taste for conceits began to decay before the turn for ridicule and persiflage , which characterised the wits of the court of Charles , Dryden was often ridiculed for the pedigree he has assigned to this literary champion . Buckingham alludes to it in his “ Poetical Reflections on the Poem of Absalom and Achitophel , ” where he calls Dryden , a</p>

   <p>The noble author of this flat parody informs us , by marginal notes , that the “ Father Publican ” means a committee man , and adds on the word Hero , “ See 's Sir Denzil Hollis . ” By which , by the way , we may notice , that his Grace 's accuracy was much of a piece with his poetry ; for the hero 's name was Frescheville .</p>
   <p>Sir Frescheville Hollis was a man of high spirit and enterprise . He lost an arm in the great sea-fight of the 3d June , a circumstance alluded to in the verses . He was Rear-Admiral of the squadron , with which Sir Robert Holmes attacked the Dutch Smyrna fleet , near the Isle of Wight , in 1671-2 . Finally , he was killed in the desperate action off Southwould bay , 28th May , 1672 . There is a remarkable passage in his will , made on the 17th May , 1665 ; by which , after stating he was going to sea , as commander of a man-of-war , he directs ,— “ In case my body should be brought to land to be buried , I desire that some stone may be laid over me , with this inscription :— Know , reader , whatsoever thou be , if I had lived , it was my intent not to have owed my memory to any other monument but what my sword should raise for me of honour and victory . ” — Collins ’ Historical Collections of the families of Cavendish , Hollis , &amp; c. page 74 .</p>

   <p>The particulars of the memorable engagement , thus introduced and described in the following stanzas , are thus narrated in the “ Lives of the Admirals . ” Vol . 11 .</p>
   <p>“ On the 25th of July , about noon , the English came up with the enemy , off the North-foreland . Sir Thomas Allen with the White squadron began the battle , by attacking Evertz . Prince Rupert and the Duke , about one in the afternoon , made a desperate attack upon de Ruyter , and , after fighting about three hours , were obliged to go on board another ship . In this space , the White squadron had entirely defeated their enemies ; Admiral Evertz , his vice-admiral de Vries , and his rear-admiral Kœnders , being all killed , the vice-admiral of Zealand taken , and another ship of 50 guns burnt . The prince and duke fought de Ruyter ship to ship , disabled the Guelderland of 66 guns , which was one of his seconds , killed the captain of another , and mortally wounded two more , upon which the Dutch squadron began to fly . However , vice-admiral Van-Nes stood bravely by de Ruyter , and received great damage ; yet , being at last deserted by all but seven ships , they yielded to necessity , and followed the rest of their fleet as fast as they could . De Ruyter 's ship was so miserably torn , and his crew so dispirited and fatigued , that he could have made but little resistance , and nothing but the want of wind hindered the English from boarding him . As for admiral Van Tromp , he was engaged with Sir Jeremiah Smith at a distance , and so could not assist his friends . As his was the strongest squadron of the Dutch fleet , and Smith 's the weakest of the English , we had not great advantage on that side ; yet some we had , his vice-admiral 's ship being disabled , and his rear-admiral killed ; which , however , did not hinder his fighting it out with much bravery , as long as there was light .</p>
   <p>“ Admiral de Ruyter continued his retreat that night , and the next day Prince Rupert and the Duke of Albemarle pursued him with part of the Red squadron , as fast as the wind would permit . A fire-ship bore down upon the Dutch admiral , and missed very little of setting him on fire . They then cannonaded again , when de Ruyter found himself so hard pressed , and his fleet in such eminent danger , that , in a fit of despair , he cried out , ‘ My God , what a wretch am I ! amongst so many thousand bullets , is not there one to put me out of my pain ? ’ By degrees , however , he drew near their own shallow coast , where the English could not follow him . Upon this occasion , Prince Rupert insulted the Dutch admiral , by sending a little shallop , called the Fanfan , with two small guns on board , which , being rowed near de Ruyter 's vessel , fired upon him for two hours together ; but at last a ball from the Dutch admiral so damaged his contemptible enemy , that the crew were forced to row , and that briskly , to save their lives . The enemy being driven over the flats into the wylings , the English went to lie at Schonevelt , the usual rendezvous of the Dutch fleets . ”</p>

   <p>The battle was fought on the 25th of July , which is the day of St James , the tutelar saint of Spain . From this circumstance , the poet takes an opportunity , in the following stanzas , to inculcate a political doctrine , which the war with Holland and France had rendered fashionable . It contains an impeachment of the policy of Queen Elizabeth , who , by supporting the Netherlands against Philip of Spain , laid , as our author contends , the foundation for rebellion , and the establishment of a republic in England . The power of the Spanish monarchy , the poet avers , was slower in its growth , and a less reasonable object of jealousy to the English , than the more active and energetic governments of France and Holland .</p>

   <p>Immediately after the battle of the 25th , the victorious fleet of England sailed for the Dutch coast , to attack the islands of Vlie and Schelling ; for which purpose , a squadron , well manned , and with a sufficient number of fire-ships , was detached under the command of Sir Robert Holmes . “ On the 8th of July , about seven in the morning , this squadron weighed , divided from the rest of the fleet , and came to anchor about a league from the Buoys , where they met the prince 's pleasure-boat , called the Fanfan , who had discovered in the harbour a considerable number of ships near the Vlie , which proved to be 170 merchant-ships , the least of which was not less than 200 ton burden , with two men of war , which had lately conveyed near a hundred of the aforesaid ships from the northward , homeward-bound , some from the Straits , some from Guinea , some from Russia , some from the East countries ; the rest were outward-bound ships , all of which likewise were very richly laden .</p>
   <p>“ Sir Robert Holmes , considering that , if he should proceed , as his design was first , to attempt a descent upon the land , that numerous fleet might possibly pour in such numbers of men , as might render the success hazardous , resolved to begin with the ships ; and , accordingly , having ordered the Advice and the Hampshire to lie without the Buoys , he weighed with the rest of his fleet ; and , the wind being contrary , he turned , with much ado , into Schelling road , where the Tyger came to anchor , and immediately Sir Robert went on board the Fanfan , and hoisted his flag , upon which the officers came on board him , and there it was ordered that the Pembroke , which drew the least water , with the fire-ships , should fall in amongst the enemy 's fleet , with what speed they could . Captain Brown , with his fire-ships , chose very bravely to lay the biggest man of war aboard , and burned him downright . Another fire-ship , running up at the same time to the other man of war , he , backing his sails , escaped the present execution of the fire-ship , but so as to run himself by it on ground , where he was presently taken by some of the long-boats , and fired . The other three fire-ships clapped the three great merchant-men on board , which carried flags in their main-tops , and burned them . This put their fleet into great confusion , which Sir Robert Holmes perceiving , made a signal for all the officers to come on board again , and presently gave orders that Sir William Jennings , with all the boats that could be spared , should take the advantage , and fall in , sink , burn , and destroy all they could , but with a strict command that they should not plunder . The execution was so well followed , each captain destroying his share , some twelve , some fifteen merchant-men , that , of the whole fleet , there escaped not above eight or nine ships , one of which was a Guinea man of war , of 24 guns , and three small privateers . These ships , being driven up into a narrower corner of the stream , served to protect four or five merchant men that were a-head of them , where it was not possible for our boats to come at them , though even these few were much damaged .</p>
   <p>“ The next day , being the 10th of August , it was found more expedient to land upon the coast of Schelling , than upon Vlie , which was performed by Sir Robert Holmes , with eleven companies , in his long-boats , and he landed with little or no opposition . When he came on shore , he left one company to secure his boats , and with the other ten marched three miles up into the country , to the capital town , called Brandaris , in which there were upwards of a thousand fine houses ; where , keeping five companies upon the skirt of the town , to prevent any surprise of the enemy , he sent the other five to set fire to the place : But , finding them somewhat slow to execute that order , and fearing they might be tempted to forget themselves in the pillage , he was himself forced to set fire to some houses to the windward , the sooner to dispatch the work , and hasten his men away , which burned with such violence , that in half an hour 's time most part of the town was in a light flame . This place was reported , by those who were found in it , to have been very rich , and so it appeared by some of the soldiers ’ pockets ; but very few people were to be seen there , having had time to escape from the danger , except some old men and women , who were used by the English , after they fell into their hands , with all possible gentleness and humanity .</p>
   <p>“ This blow greatly affected the Dutch , who , according to their own accounts , suffered the loss of near six millions of guilders ; and , if we take the ships into this computation , they confess they were losers to the amount of eleven millions , or one million , one hundred thousand pounds sterling . ” — Lives of the Admirals , Vol .

   <p>The dreadful Fire of London befel almost ere the inhabitants had done with rejoicing over the flames which consumed the fleet at Vlie , and the town of Brandaris . This horrible conflagration took its rise in the house of one Farryner , an obscure baker in Pudding-lane , near New Fish Street . It broke out on the night preceding the 2d September , 1666 , with astonishing fury ; and the houses in the lane , and its neighbourhood , being entirely constructed of timber , warped , and dried by a long drought , its progress was soon so rapid , that the inhabitants were content to escape from it with their lives , without attempting to save their moveables , far less to intercept the progress of the conflagration . In the morning , the attempts to stop a fire , now become so general , and which raged amidst such combustible buildings , proved totally ineffectual . The narrowness of the streets , and the nature of the houses was such , that , where one house was on fire , the devastation soon became general ; and a strong east wind ( a Belgian wind , as Dryden calls it ) , prevailing through the whole day , the flames , by various means of approach , occupied and surrounded the greater part of the city , properly so called . The magazines of naval stores , pitch , tar , hemp , dried wood , and other materials for shipping , which occupied the yards by the side of the river , soon caught the flames , to which they afforded a most horrible supply of strength and nourishment . All help seemed now to be in vain ; for it is one thing to quench a fire , which has only occupied a few houses , and against which all the skill and exertion of those best qualified to check its progress can be at once directed , and another to extinguish a conflagration which occupies many streets , and which , if quelled in one spot where skillfully opposed , is triumphant in many others , where its ravages are only the object of wonder and lamentation to the heartless and ignorant citizens . At length universal destruction and dismay prevented the adoption of uniform or effectual measures against the destruction which seemed to impend in every quarter . The progress and extinction of this horrible fire will be learned from the text , and the following notes .</p>

   <p>Dryden , in the hurry of composition , has here made a slight inaccuracy . It was not Simois , but Xanthus , otherwise called Scamander , who , having undertaken to drown Achilles , was nearly dried up by the devouring fires of Vulcan . He called , indeed , upon his brother river to assist him in his undertaking , but Simois appears to have maintained a prudent neutrality . See the Iliad , Book XXI .</p>

   <p>The king , by his conduct during this emergency , gained more upon the hearts of his subjects , than by any action of his life . Completely awakened , by so dreadful an emergence , from his usual lethargy of pleasure and indolence , he came into the now half-burned city , with his brother and the nobility , and gave an admirable specimen of what his character was capable , when in a state of full exertion . Not contented with passive expressions of sorrow and sympathy , he issued the most prudent orders , and animated their execution by his presence . His anxiety was divided betwixt the task of stopping the conflagration , and the no less necessary and piteous duty of relieving those thousands , who , having lost their all by the fire , had neither a morsel of food , nor a place of shelter . For the one purpose , he spared neither commands , threats , example , nor liberal rewards , which he lavished with his own hand ; for the other , he opened his naval and military magazines , and distributed among the miserable and starving sufferers , the provisions designed for his fleet and army . In fine , such were his exertions , and so grateful were his people , that they deemed his presence had an almost supernatural power , and clamourously entreated not to be deprived of it , when , after the fire was quenched , he was about to leave London .</p>

   <p>“ So many houses were now burning together , that water could not be had in sufficient quantities where it was wanted . The only remedy left was , to blow up houses at convenient distances from those which were on fire , and to make , by that means , void spaces , at which the fury of the conflagration should spend itself for want of fuel . But this means also proved ineffectual ; for the fire , in some places , made its way by means of the combustible part of the rubbish of the ruined houses , not well cleared , and in others , by flakes of burning matter of different kinds , which were carried through the air , by the impetuous wind , to great distances . And the city being at that time almost all built of very old timber , which had besides been parched and scorched by the sun the whole preceding summer , one of the hottest and dryest that had been ever known , it came to pass that , wherever such fiery matter chanced to light , it seldom wanted fit fuel to work and feed upon . ” — Baker 's Chronicle , p. 642 .

   <p>The Duke of York was as active and vigilant as his brother upon this melancholy occasion . His exertions and seasonable directions , prevented the fire from breaking out afresh from the Inner Temple , after it had been got under in other places of the town . Yet the idle calumny , which stigmatized the Roman Catholics , as the authors of the conflagration , was often extended to James himself . In that tissue of falsehood and misrepresentation , which Titus Oates entitled , “ A Picture of the Late King James , ” he charges him “ with beholding the flames with joy , and the ruins with much rejoicing , ” p. 30 , and says he would have impeached him , as an accessary to the raising of that fire , had he not promised to Prince Rupert to bring forward no accusation that could hurt the king ; “ for I could not charge you , ” says he , “ but must charge him too . ” In which case , by the way , this able witness would have made the king accessary to his own murder , which , according to Oates ’ own evidence , was to have been perpetrated during the fire , had not the hearts of the Jesuits failed them , on seeing the zeal with which he laboured to extinguish it .</p>

   <p>In this , and foregoing verses , the miseries of those , whose houses were consumed , are strikingly painted . Many fled for refuge to the houses of friends , and lodged there the remnants of their property , which they had been able to save . These were often forced to abandon their places of asylum , by a fresh invasion of the devouring element , and to yield up to its rage all which they had before rescued . At length , distrusting safety in the city itself , the villages in its vicinity soon became filled with fugitives , till , in the end , no place of refuge was left but the open fields , where thousands remained for several nights , without shelter , watching the progress of the flames , which were consuming the metropolis .</p>

   <p>In 1665 , the plague broke out in London with the most dreadful fury . In one year , upwards of 90 , 000 inhabitants were cut off by this frightful visitation .

   <p>Waller had addressed a poem to Charles I. upon his Majesty 's repairing St Paul 's . Denham , in the commencement of “ Cowper 's Hill , ” alludes both to the labours of the monarch , and of the poet :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Paul 's , the late theme of such a muse , whose flight</l>
     <l n="2">Has bravely reached and soared above thy height ,</l>

     <l n="6">Preserved from ruin by the best of kings .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The fire of London , however , neither respected the labours of Charles , the song of Waller , nor the prophecy of Sir John Denham . During the conflagration , as St Paul 's was in an insulated situation , and constructed of strong stone-work , it was long thought to be in no danger from the fire , and many of the sufferers employed it as a place of deposit for the wreck of their goods and fortunes . But the whole adjoining buildings in the churchyard being in a light flame , it became impossible , even for the massy fabric of the cathedral , to resist the combustion . The wood arches and supports being consumed , the stone-work gave way with a most horrible crash , and buried the whole edifice in a pile of smoking ruins .</p>

   <p>The inscription on the monument states , that the fire consumed eighty-nine churches , the city-gates , Guildhall , many public structures , hospitals , schools , libraries , a vast number of stately edifices , thirteen thousand two hundred dwelling houses , four hundred streets . Three hundred and seventy-three acres within the city walls , and sixty-three acres and three roods without the walls , remained heaped with the smoking ruins of the houses , which had once occupied them .</p>

   <p>About ten o'clock of the evening of Tuesday the 5th of September , after the fire had raged for three days , the high east wind , which had been the means of forcing on its ravages , began to abate , and , in proportion , the efforts used to stop the progress of the flames became effectual . In some places , houses being opportunely blown up prevented the further spreading of the fire ; in others , the flames , spent for lack of fuel , seemed to go out of themselves . On the morning of the 6th , the conflagration was totally extinguished .</p>
   <p>The prejudices of the times assigned different causes for this tragical event , according to the political principles of the discordant parties . Most agreed , that the fire was raised by design ; for , although the multitude are content to allow , that a private person may die suddenly of a natural disorder , or that a cottage may be consumed by accidental fire ; yet the death of a king , or the conflagration of a metropolis , must , according to their habits of thinking , arise from some dark and dismal plot , planned , doubtless , by those , whose religious or political sentiments are most remote from their own . The royalists accused the fanatics ; the puritans the papists , of being the raisers of this dreadful fire . Some suspected even the king and duke of York ; though it is somewhat difficult to see any advantage they could derive from burning a city , which had been just loading them both with treasures . The Monument , whose inscription adopts one of these rash opinions , is a more stately , but not a more respectable , record of prejudice , than the stone figure in Smithfield , whose tablet declares , the fire must have been specially and exclusively a judgment for the crime of GLUTTONY , since it began in Pudding-Lane , and ended in Pye-Corner !</p>
   <p>An event so signally calamitous called forth , as may be readily supposed , the condolence and consolations , such as they were , of the poets of the day . One author , who designs himself J . A . Fellow of King 's College , Cambridge , poured forth verses “ Upon the late lamentable Fire in London , in an humble imitation of the most incomparable Mr Cowley his Pindaric strain . ” This usurper of the Theban lyre informs us , that</p>

   <p>According to the jargon of astrology , a trine , or triangular conjunction of planets , was supposed to be eminently benign to mankind . To this Dryden adds the circumstance of the planet Jove being in his ascension , as a favourable aspect . Our poet was not above being seriously influenced by these fooleries ; and I dare say will be found , on reference to any almanack of 1666 , to have given a very accurate account of the relative state of the heavenly bodies in that year .</p>

   <p>It is here truly stated , that the calamity of the great fire was ultimately attended with excellent consequences to the city . By a proclamation from the king , of an arbitrary and dictatorial nature , but which the emergency seems to have justified , the citizens were prohibited from rebuilding their houses , except with solid materials , and upon such plans as should be set forth by a committee appointed for the purpose . In this manner , the endless disputes about property , whose boundaries were now undistinguishable , were at once silenced , and provision was made for the improvements in widening the streets , and prohibiting the use of lath and timber , of which materials the houses were formerly composed . “ Had the king , ” says Hume , “ been enabled to carry his power still farther , and made the houses be rebuilt with perfect regularity , and entirely upon one plan , he had contributed much to the convenience , as well as embellishment , of the city . Great advantages , however , have resulted from the alterations , though not carried to the full length . London became much more healthful after the fire . The plague , which used to break out with great fury twice or thrice every century , and indeed which was always lurking in some corner or other of the city , has scarcely ever appeared since that calamity . ” — Vol .

   <p>ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL .</p>
   <p>The following poem has been uniformly and universally admired , not only as one of Dryden 's most excellent performances , but as indisputably the best and most nervous political satire that ever was written . It is said to have been undertaken at the command of Charles ; and if so , no king was ever better obeyed . The general state of parties in England during the last years of the reign of Charles II . has been often noticed , particularly in the notes on “ The Duke of Guise , ” Vol . VI . Shaftesbury , dismissed from the administration , had bent his whole genius for intrigue , to effect the exclusion of the Duke of York from the crown of England , even at the risque of a civil war . Monmouth had thrown himself into the arms of the same party , flattered by the prospect of occupying that place from which his uncle was to be excluded . Every thing seemed to flatter his ambition . The pretensions of the Duke 's daughters must necessarily have been compromised by the exclusion of their father . At any rate , they were not likely to be supported by a powerful party , while Monmouth , by his own personal influence , and that of Shaftesbury , was at the head of all , whom zeal for religion , disappointed ambition , restlessness of temper , love of liberty , or desire of licentiousness , had united in opposition to the measures of the court . Every engine which judgement or wit could dictate , was employed by either party to place their cause in the most favourable light , and prejudice that of their adversaries . Among these , the poem which follows was the most powerful , and the most successful . The time of its appearance was chosen with as much art , as the poem displays genius . Shaftesbury had been committed to the Tower on a charge of high treason on the 2d July , and the poem was published a few days before a bill of indictment was presented against him . The sensation excited by such a poem , at such a time , was intense and universal .</p>
   <p>It has been hitherto generally supposed , that the idea of applying to Charles and Monmouth the apt characters and story of Absalom and Achitophel , and indeed the general plan of drawing a poetical parallel from scriptural history to modern times , was exclusively our author 's . This appears to be a mistake . So far back as 1679 , some favourer of Lord Stafford and of the Catholic cause ventured to paraphrase the story of Naboth 's vineyard , and to apply it to the condemnation of that unfortunate nobleman for the Catholic plot . In that piece , the scripture names and characters are given to the objects of the poet 's satire , precisely on the plan adopted by Dryden in “ Absalom and Achitophel ,"[ 208 ] as the reader will perceive from the extracts in the note . Not only had the scheme of a similar poem been conceived , but the very passage of Scripture , adopted by Dryden as the foundation of his parable , had been already applied to Charles and his undutiful son . There appeared , in 1680 , a small tract , called “ Absalom 's Conspiracy , or the Tragedy of Treason , ” which , as it seems to have furnished the general argument of Dryden 's poem , and has been unnoticed by any former commentator , I have subjoined to these introductory remarks . ( See p . 205 . )</p>
   <p>In a “ Letter also to his grace the duke of Monmouth , this 15 July 1680 , by a true lover of his person and the peace of the kingdom , ” the same adaptation is thus warmly urged .</p>
   <p>“ These are the men ( speaking of Monmouth 's advisers ) that would , with Joab , send for the wise woman to persuade king David to admit of a return for Absalom his son ; and when they had effected it , leave him to himself , till anger and passion had set fire to the field of Joab . These are the men , that would have advised Absalom to make chariots , and to take fifty men to run before him , and appoint his time and station beside the way of the gate , to enquire of the tribes of Israel , that came up to the king for justice , what their controversies and matters were . These are the men , that would have advised young Absalom , that since David had appointed no one to hear their grieveances ( which was a political lye ) , and relieve their oppressions , to wish , “ Oh that I were made judge in the land , that every man that hath any suit or cause might come to me , and I would do him justice ! ” In short , these unprincipled men were they that set on Absalom to steal away the hearts of the people from the king ; these are they , that advised him to go to Hebron to pay his vow ; and these are the men , that led him into actual rebellion against his father , and to be destroyed by some of the very hands that had assisted him in those pernicious counsels . ” Somers ’ Tracts , p. 111 .</p>
   <p>The parallel , from its aptness to the circumstances , appears to have become popular ; for Shaftesbury was distinguished by the nickname of Achitophel<span corresp="#note209" type="note_anchor">[ 209 ]</span>before the appearance of the following poem .</p>
   <p>On the merits of Dryden 's satire , all critics have been long agreed . “ If it be considered , ” says Dr Johnson , “ as a poem political and controversial , it will be found to comprise all the excellencies of which the subject is susceptible ; acrimony of censure , elegance of praise , artful delineation of character , variety and vigour of sentiment , happy turns of language , and pleasing harmony of numbers ; and all these raised to such a height as can scarcely be found in any other English composition . ” The more deeply we examine the plan of the piece , the more reason we will find to applaud the exquisite skill of the author . In the character of Absalom , particularly , he had a delicate task to perform . He was to draw the misguided and offending son , but not the hardened reprobate ; for Charles , notwithstanding his just indignation , was to the end of his reign partial to this unfortunate prince , and anxious to detach him from his desperate counsellors . Dryden has , accordingly , liberally transferred all the fouler part of the accusation to the shoulders of Achitophel , while he is tender of the fame of Absalom . We may suppose , that , in doing so , the poet indulged his own feelings : the Duchess of Buccleuch had been his most early patroness , and he had received personal favours from Monmouth himself ,<span corresp="#note210" type="note_anchor">[ 210 ]</span>These recollections must have had weight with him , when engaged in composing this party poem ; and we may readily believe him , when he affirms , that David could not be more tender of the young man 's life , than he would be of his reputation . In many of the other characters , that of Buckingham in particular , a certain degree of mercy is preserved , even amid the severity of satire . The follies of Zimri are exposed to ridicule ; but his guilt , ( and the age accused him of most foul crimes ,) is left in the shade . Even in drawing the character of Achitophel , such a degree of justice is rendered to his acute talents , and to his merits as a judge , that we are gained by the poet 's apparent candour to give him credit for the truth of the portrait in its harsher features . It is remarkable , that the only considerable additions made to the poem , after the first edition , have a tendency rather to mollify than to sharpen the satire . The following additional passage , in the character of Achitophel , stands in this predicament :</p>
   <lg>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>These , and other passages , in which Dryden has softened the severity of his muse , evince not only the poet 's taste and judgment , but that tone of honourable and just feeling , which distinguishes a true satire from a libellous lampoon .</p>
   <p>It was not consistent with Dryden 's subject to introduce much imagery or description into “ Absalom and Achitophel ; ” but , though Dr Johnson has remarked this as a disadvantage to the poem , it was , I think , amply compensated by the good effects which the restraint produced on our author 's style of composition . The reader has already seen in how many instances Dryden gave way to the false taste of his age , which , indeed , furnished the strongest temptation to a vigorous mind , naturally delighting to exert itself in working out an ingenious parallel between remote and dissimilar ideas . A fiery horse is taught his regular paces by the restraining discipline of the manege ; and , in the same way , the subject of “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” which confined the poet to the expression of sentiment and character , and left no room for excursions into the regions of metaphysical poetry , probably had the effect of restraining his exertions within the bounds of true taste , whose precincts he would be less likely to overleap , even when again turned loose upon a more fanciful theme . It is certain that “ Absalom and Achitophel ” is as remarkable for correctness of taste , as for fire and spirit of composition ; nor ought the reader , amidst so many appropriate beauties , to regret those flights of imagination , which could not have been indulged without impropriety .</p>
   <p>Another objection , stated to this poem , has been the abrupt and unsatisfactory nature of the conclusion . The factions , and their leaders , are described ; and , when our expectation is at the highest , the danger is at once dispelled by a speech from the throne . “ Who , ” says Johnson , “ can forbear to think of an enchanted castle , with a wide moat , and lofty battlements , which vanishes at once into air , when the destined knight blows his horn before it . ” Yet , with great deference to such authority , it may be considered as somewhat hard to expect the merit of a well-conducted story in a poem merely intended as a designation of various living characters . He , who collects a gallery of portraits , disclaims , by the very act of doing so , any intention of presenting a series of historical events . Each separate style of poetry has its merits and disadvantages , but we should not expect a historical work to contain the poignancy of a satire , or a satire to exhibit the majestic and interesting story of an epic poem . Besides , there had actually been an important crisis , and highly favourable to the court , produced by the king 's behaviour at Oxford , and by the sudden dissolution of that parliament , which , according to Shaftesbury , was to have rendered the Duke of York as abandoned an exile as the first murderer Cain . This stroke of power was executed so unexpectedly , that the Commons had not the slightest suspicion of what was intended , till they were summoned by the Black Rod to attend the king . Oxford , so lately crowded with the armed factionaries and partizans of royalty and democracy , was at once deserted , and left to its usual stillness and seclusion . The blow was fatal to the country party , as it dispersed that body in which they had knit up their strength , and which alone could give their proceedings the sanction of law .</p>
   <p>The success of “ Absalom and Achitophel ” was unexampled . Dr Johnson 's father , a bookseller , told him , it was exceeded by nothing in his remembrance , excepting that of Sacheverel 's Sermon . The allusions which it contained became universally known ; and the allegorical names seemed to be inalienably entailed upon the persons to whom Dryden had assigned them . Not only were they in perpetual use amongst the court poets of the day ,<span corresp="#note212" type="note_anchor">[ 212 ]</span>but the parable was repeatedly inculcated and preached upon from the pulpit ,<span corresp="#note213" type="note_anchor">[ 213 ]</span>and echoed and re-echoed in all the addresses of the time .<span corresp="#note214" type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span></p>
   <p>The poem was at first published without a name , a circumstance which must have added to the curiosity of the public ; there were , however , few writers , save the author , who could be suspected even for a moment , and it is probable he did not remain long concealed . The poem was published on the 17th November , 1681 ,<span corresp="#note215" type="note_anchor">[ 215 ]</span>and , as early as the 10th of December , Dryden is attacked as the author , in a miserable Grubstreet poem , called “ Towser the Second , ” supposed to be written by Henry Care .<span corresp="#note216" type="note_anchor">[ 216 ]</span>Then came forth , on the 14th , His Grace of Buckingham 's “ Poetical Reflections , ” which are amply analysed in our notes . A non-conformist clergyman ( name unknown ) advanced to the charge on the 25th , with a pamphlet termed , “ A Whip for the Fool 's Back ; ” and followed it up with the “ Key with the Whip , to open the mystery and iniquity of the poem called Absalom and Achitophel . ” Then Samuel Pordage published “ Azariah and Hushai ; ” and , finally , our author 's old antagonist , Elkanah Settle , brought up the heavy rear with a ponderous pamphlet entitled , “ Absalom Senior ; or , Achitophel Transposed , a Poem . ” All these laborious and indignant vindications and rebutters served only to shew how much the faction was hurt by this spirited satire , and how unable they were to make an effectual retort . Were we to judge of their strength in other respects , from the efforts of their writers , we should esteem them very unworthy of Dryden 's satire , and exclaim , as Tybalt does to Benvolio ,</p>
   <p>What dost thou , drawn , among these heartless hinds ?</p>
   <p>Accordingly , Dryden takes but slight and contemptuous notice of any of his antagonists , save Shadwell and Settle , on whom he inflicts a severe flagellation in the Second Part . On the other hand , Nahum Tate , and other tory poets , came forth with congratulatory verses , the inferiority of which served to shew that Dryden 's force did not lie in the principles and subject which he had in common with these poetasters , but in the incommunicable resources of his own genius .</p>
   <p>The first part of “ Absalom and Achitophel ” is in folio , “ Printed for J. T. ( Jacob Tonson ) and are to be sold by W. Davis , in Amen corner , 1681 . ” A second edition was issued before the end of December , which was followed by many more . Mr Malone believes that the edition which appeared in the Miscellanies was the sixth ; and a quarto copy , now before me , dated 1692 , calls itself “ the Seventh Edition , augmented and revised . ” Two Latin versions of “ Absalom and Achitophel ” were executed ; one by the famous Atterbury , afterwards bishop of Rochester , the other by Dr Coward .</p>
   <p>“ Absalom 's Conspiracy : or , the Tragedy of Treason . ” London , printed in the year 1680 . Folio , containing two pages . Reprinted in the Harleian Miscellany .</p>
   <p>“ There is nothing so dangerous either to societies in general , or to particular persons , as ambition ; the temptations of sovereignty , and the glittering lustre of a crown , have been guilty of all the fearful consequences that can be within the compass of imagination . For this , mighty nations have been drowned in blood , populous cities have been made , desolate , laid in ashes , and left without inhabitants ; for this , parents have lost all the sense and tenderness of nature ; and children , all the sentiments of duty and obedience ; the eternal laws of good and just , the laws of nature and of nations , of God and religion , have been violated ; men have been transformed into the cruelty of beasts , and into the rage and malice of devils .</p>
   <p>“ Instances , both modern and ancient , of this , are innumerable ; but this of Absalom is a tragedy , whose antiquity and truth do equally recommend it as an example to all posterity , and a caution to all mankind , to take care how they embark in ambitious and unlawful designs ; and it is a particular caveat to all young men , to beware of such counsellors as the old Achitophel , lest , while they are tempted with the hopes of a crown , they hasten on their own destiny , and come to an untimely end .</p>
   <p>“ Absalom was the third son of David by Maachah , the daughter of Talmai , king of Geshur , who was one of David 's concubines ; he , seeing his title to the crown upon the score of lawful succession would not do , resolved to make good what was defective in it by open force , by dethroning his father .</p>
   <p>“ Now the arts he used to accomplish his design were these . First , he studied popularity ; he rose up early , he was industrious and diligent in his way ; he placed himself in the way of the gate ; and when any man came for judgment , he courteously entered into discourse with him . This feigned condescension was the first step of his ambition . Secondly , he depraved his father 's government : the king was careless , drowned in his pleasures ; the counsellors were evil ; no man regarded the petitioners : Absalom said unto him ,— See , thy matters are good and right , it is but reason that you petition for ; but there is no man that will hear thee from the king ; there is no justice to be found , your petitions are rejected . Thirdly , he insinuates what he would do if he were in authority ; how easy access should be to him ; he would do them justice ; he would hear and redress their grievances , receive their petitions , and give them gracious answers :— Oh that I were made judge in the land , that every man might come unto me , and I would do him justice ! And , when any man came to do him obeysance , he put forth his hand , and took him and kissed him ; and thus he stole away the hearts of the people from their lawful king , his father and sovereign .</p>
   <p>“ But all this would not do ; he therefore joins himself to one Achitophel , an old man of a shrewd head , and discontented heart . This Achitophel , it seems , had been a great counsellor of David 's ; but was now under some disgrace , as appears by Absalom 's sending for him from Gilo , his city , whither he was in discontent retreated , because David had advanced Hushai into his privy-council ; and no doubt can be made , but he was of the conspiracy before , by his ready joining with Absalom as soon as the matters were ripe for execution .</p>
   <p>“ Absalom having thus laid his train , and made secret provision for his intended rebellion , dispatches his emissaries abroad , to give notice by his spies , that all the confederates should be ready at the sound of the trumpet , and say , Absalom reigneth in Hebron ; and immediately a great multitude was gathered to him ; for the conspiracy was strong ; some went out of malice , and some in their simplicity followed him , and knew not any thing .</p>
   <p>“ David is forced to fly from his son , but still he had a loyal party that stuck close to him . Achitophel gave devilish counsel , but God disappointed it strangely ; for Hushai , pretending to come over to their party , put Absalom upon a plausible expedient , which proved his ruin . So impossible is it for treason to be secure , that no person who forms a conspiracy , but there may be some , who , under pretence of the greatest kindness , may insinuate themselves , only to discover their secrets , and ruin their intentions , either by revealing their treason , or disappointing it ; and certainly , of all men , traitors are least to be trusted ; for they who can be perfidious to one , can never be true to any .</p>
   <p>“ The matter comes at last to the decision of the sword . Absalom 's party are defeated , and many slain , and Absalom himself , seeking to save himself by flight in the wood , is entangled in a tree by his own hair , which was his pride ; and his mule going from under him , there left him hanging till Joab came , and , with three darts , made at once an end of his life and the rebellion . Thus ended his youthful and foolish ambition , making him an eternal monument of infamy , and an instance of the justice of divine vengeance , and what will be the conclusion of ambition , treason , and conspiracy , against lawful kings and governors : A severe admonition to all green heads , to avoid the temptations of grey Achitophels .</p>
   <p>“ Achitophel , the engineer of all this mischief , seeing his counsel despised , and foreseeing the event , prevented the hand of the executioner , and , in revenge upon himself , went home and hanged himself ; give fair warning to all treacherous counsellors , to see what their devilish counsels will lead them to at last ; mischievous counsel ever falling in conclusion upon the heads where first it was contrived , as naturally as dirty kennels fall into the common-sewer .</p>
   <p>“ Whatsoever was written aforetime , was written for our instruction : for holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost . ”</p>

   <p>TO THE READER .</p>
   <p>It is not my intention to make an apology for my poem ; some will think it needs no excuse , and others will receive none . The design I am sure is honest ; but he who draws his pen for one party , must expect to make enemies of the other . For wit and fool , are consequents of Whig and Tory ;<span corresp="#note217" type="note_anchor">[ 217 ]</span>and every man is a knave or an ass to the contrary side . There is a treasury of merits in the fanatic church , as well as in the popish ; and a pennyworth to be had of saintship , honesty , and poetry , for the lewd , the factious , and the blockheads ; but the longest chapter in Deuteronomy has not curses enough for an Anti-Bromingham .<span corresp="#note218" type="note_anchor">[ 218 ]</span>My comfort is , their manifest prejudice to my cause will render their judgment of less authority against me . Yet , if a poem have genius , it will force its own reception in the world ; for there is a sweetness in good verse , which tickles even while it hurts ; and no man can be heartily angry with him who pleases him against his will . The commendation of adversaries is the greatest triumph of a writer , because it never comes unless extorted . But I can be satisfied on more easy terms ; if I happen to please the more moderate sort , I shall be sure of an honest party , and , in all probability , of the best judges ; for the least concerned are commonly the least corrupt . And I confess I have laid in for those , by rebating the satire , where justice would allow it , from carrying too sharp an edge . They who can criticise so weakly , as to imagine I have done my worst , may be convinced , at their own cost , that I can write severely , with more ease than I can gently . I have but laughed at some men 's follies , when I could have declaimed against their vices ; and other men 's virtues I have commended , as freely as I have taxed their crimes . And now , if you are a malicious reader , I expect you should return upon me , that I affect to be thought more impartial than I am ; but if men are not to be judged by their professions , God forgive you commonwealth'shYpppHeNmen for professing so plausibly for the government ! You cannot be so unconscionable as to charge me for not subscribing my name ; for that would reflect too grossly upon your own party , who never dare , though they have the advantage of a jury to secure them . If you like not my poem , the fault may possibly be in my writing ; though it is hard for an author to judge against himself : but more probably it is in your morals , which cannot bear the truth of it . The violent on both sides will condemn the character of Absalom , as either too favourably or too hardly drawn . But they are not the violent whom I desire to please . The fault on the right hand is to extenuate , palliate , and indulge ; and , to confess freely , I have endeavoured to commit it . Besides the respect which I owe his birth , I have a greater for his heroic virtues ; and David himself could not be more tender of the young man 's life , than I would be of his reputation . But since the most excellent natures are always the most easy , and , as being such , are the soonest perverted by ill counsels , especially when baited with fame and glory , it is no more a wonder that he withstood not the temptations of Achitophel , than it was for Adam not to have resisted the two devils , the serpent and the woman . The conclusion of the story I purposely forbore to prosecute , because I could not obtain from myself to shew Absalom unfortunate . The frame of it was cut out but for a picture to the waist ; and if the draught be so far true , it is as much as I designed .</p>
   <p>Were I the inventor , who am only the historian , I should certainly conclude the piece , with the reconcilement of Absalom to David . And who knows but this may come to pass ? Things were not brought to an extremity where I left the story ; there seems yet to be room left for a composure ; hereafter there may be only for pity . I have not so much as an uncharitable wish against Achitophel , but am content to be accused of a good-natured error , and to hope with Origen , that the devil himself may at last be saved . For which reason , in this poem , he is neither brought to set his house in order , nor to dispose of his person afterwards as he in wisdom shall think fit . God is infinitely merciful ; and his vicegerent is only not so , because he is not infinite .</p>
   <p>The true end of satire is the amendment of vices by correction . And he , who writes honestly , is no more an enemy to the offender , than the physician to the patient , when he prescribes harsh remedies to an inveterate disease ; for those are only in order to prevent the chirurgeon 's work of an Ense rescindendum , which I wish not to my very enemies . To conclude all ; if the body politic have any analogy to the natural , in my weak judgment , an act of oblivion were as necessary in a hot distempered state , as an opiate would be in a raging fever .</p>
   <p>RECOMMENDATORY VERSES .</p>
   <p>The following Recommendatory Verses , Dryden thought worthy of being prefixed to the later editions of his “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” for which reason they are here retained . It will be observed , that they all mention the author as unknown . This , however , we are not to understand literally ; since it is obvious , from the contemporary libels , that Dryden was well known for the author . But , till he placed his name in the title page , his friends were not to affect to know more than that told them ; as it is impolite to recognize a person who affects a disguise .</p>

    <head>FOOTNOTES :</head>
    <note xml:id="note217" place="bottom" n="217">These famous expressions of party distinction were just coming into fashion . Whig , a contraction of Whigamore , is a word used by the peasantry in the west of Scotland in driving their horses , and gave a name to those fanatics who were the supporters of the Covenant in that part of Scotland . It was first used to designate an insurrection of these people in 1648 , called the Whigamore 's road . It has been less accurately derived from the sour-milk used by these people , called whig . But the former use of the word was much more likely to afford a party appellation .— The Tories owe their distinctive epithet to the Irish banditti , who used the word Toree , or “ give me , ” in robbing passengers . Hence , in the old translation of Buchanan 's History , the followers of Buccleuch are called the Tories of Teviotdale . As , from religion and other motives , the Irish were almost all attached to the Duke of York , the word Tory was generally applied to his party by the opposite faction , who , on the other hand , were called Whigs , as having embraced the fanatical and rebellious principles of the Scottish covenanters . The Duke of York 's followers are supposed to be thus described by his Grace himself , in a lampoon called “ Popish Politics unmasked : ”</note>

   <p>One of the first applications of the word Tory to a party purpose , occurs in “ a True Relation of a late Barbarous Assault committed on Robert Pye , Esq . ” in which one John Bodnam , of Brunguin , in the county of Hereford , “ an obstinate and violent papist , ” is said by the author to have defended himself against the constable and his assistants “ so well , or rather so ill , ” that they were forced to retire and leave him “ than which a Toree or an Outlaw could have done no more . ” Finally , the justice having appeared in person , Mr Bodnam , “ in good earnest let fly at his head with a hedge-bill , ” which , the author says , is “ no bad argument for the truth of the black bills prepared for the papists in Ireland . ” This paper is dated 1681 . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note218" place="bottom" n="218">Birmingham was already noted for base and counterfeit coinage . In a Panegyrick on their Royal Highnesses congratulating their return from Scotland , 1682 , mention is thus made of Shaftesbury 's medal :</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The wretch that stamped it got immortal fame ;</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Twas coined by stealth , like groats at Birmingham .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Tom Brown also alluded to the same practice ; “ I coined heroes as fast as Brumingham groats . "[ 219 ] The affected zeal of the country party for the Protestant religion , led them to be called Birmingham Protestants , while the pretensions of Monmouth to legitimacy led his adversaries to compare him to a spurious impression of the king 's coin ; and thus Birmingham became a term of reproach for him , his assumed title , and his faction in general . There are numerous allusions to this in the libels of the age . Thus , in “ Old Jemmy , an excellent new Ballad , ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Old Jemmy is the top ,</l>
     <l n="2">And cheef among the princes ;</l>

     <l n="4">With Bromingham pretences .</l>

     <l n="5">In another ballad bearing the same title , the same phrase occurs :</l>

     <l n="9">Old Jemmy 's come again .</l>

   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In another Grubstreet performance , entitled , “ a Medley on the plot , by</l>

   </lg>
   <p>North , however , gives rather a different derivation . He says , that the loyalists , becoming anxious to retort some nickname in return for that of tories with which they had been branded , first called their “ adversaries true blues ; because such were not satisfied to be Protestants as the churchmen were , but must be true Protestants , implying the others to be false ones , just not Papists . Then they went on , and stiled the adversary Birmingham Protestants , alluding to the false groats struck at that place . This held a considerable time ; but the word was not fluent enough for hasty repartee , and after divers changes , the lot fell on the word whig , which was very significative , as well as ready , being vernacular in Scotland , whence it was borrowed , for sour and corrupted whey . Immediately the train took , and , upon the first touch of the experiment , it ran like wild fire , and became general . ” Examen . p. 321 .</p>

     <l n="7">Then Israel 's monarch<span corresp="#note221" type="note_anchor">[ 221 ]</span>after heaven 's own heart ,</l>
     <l n="8">His vigorous warmth did variously impart</l>
     <l n="9">To wives and slaves ; and , wide as his command ,</l>
     <l n="10">Scattered his Maker 's image through the land .</l>

     <l n="13">Not so the rest ; for several mothers bore</l>

     <l n="15">But since like slaves his bed they did ascend ,</l>
     <l n="16">No true succession could their seed attend .</l>
     <l n="17">Of all the<span corresp="#note223" type="note_anchor">[ 223 ]</span>numerous progeny was none</l>

     <l n="21">Or that his conscious destiny made way ,</l>
     <l n="22">By manly beauty , to imperial sway .</l>
     <l n="23">Early in foreign fields he won renown ,</l>
     <l n="24">With kings and states , allied to Israel 's crown ;</l>
     <l n="25">In peace the thoughts of war he could remove ,</l>
     <l n="26">And seemed as he were only born for love .</l>
     <l n="27">Whate'er he did , was done with so much ease ,</l>
     <l n="28">In him alone twas natural to please ;</l>
     <l n="29">His motions all accompanied with grace ,</l>
     <l n="30">And paradise was opened in his face .</l>
     <l n="31">With secret joy indulgent David viewed</l>
     <l n="32">His youthful image in his son renewed ;</l>
     <l n="33">To all his wishes nothing he denied ,</l>
     <l n="34">And made the charming Annabel his bride .<span corresp="#note226" type="note_anchor">[ 226 ]</span></l>

     <l n="36">His father could not , or he would not see .</l>

     <l n="45">The Jews , a headstrong , moody , murmuring race ,</l>

     <l n="47">God 's pampered people , whom , debauched with ease ,</l>
     <l n="48">No king could govern , nor no God could please ;</l>

     <l n="50">That godsmiths could produce , or priests devise ;</l>
     <l n="51">These Adam-wits , too fortunately free ,</l>

     <l n="54">Of men , by laws less circumscribed and bound ;</l>
     <l n="55">They led their wild desires to woods and caves ,</l>

     <l n="57">They who , when Saul<span corresp="#note228" type="note_anchor">[ 228 ]</span>was dead , without a blow ,</l>

     <l n="59">Who banished David<span corresp="#note230" type="note_anchor">[ 230 ]</span>did from Hebron<span corresp="#note231" type="note_anchor">[ 231 ]</span>bring ,</l>
     <l n="60">And with a general shout proclaimed him king ;</l>
     <l n="61">Those very Jews , who at their very best ,</l>
     <l n="62">Their humour more than loyalty exprest ,</l>
     <l n="63">Now wondered why so long they had obeyed</l>
     <l n="64">An idol monarch , which their hands had made ;</l>
     <l n="65">Thought they might ruin him they could create ,</l>
     <l n="66">Or melt him to that golden calf ,— a state .</l>
     <l n="67">But these were random bolts ; no formed design ,</l>
     <l n="68">Nor interest made the factious crowd to join :</l>
     <l n="69">The sober part of Israel , free from stain ,</l>
     <l n="70">Well knew the value of a peaceful reign ;</l>
     <l n="71">And , looking backward with a wise affright ,</l>
     <l n="72">Saw seams of wounds dishonest to the sight ;</l>
     <l n="73">In contemplation of whose ugly scars ,</l>
     <l n="74">They curst the memory of civil wars .</l>
     <l n="75">The moderate sort of men , thus qualified ,</l>
     <l n="76">Inclined the balance to the better side ;</l>
     <l n="77">And David 's mildness managed it so well ,</l>
     <l n="78">The bad found no occasion to rebel .</l>
     <l n="79">But when to sin our biassed nature leans ,</l>
     <l n="80">The careful devil is still at hand with means ,</l>
     <l n="81">And providently pimps for ill desires ;</l>
     <l n="82">The good old cause , revived , a plot requires .</l>
     <l n="83">Plots , true or false , are necessary things ,</l>
     <l n="84">To raise up commonwealths , and ruin kings .</l>
     <l n="85">The inhabitants of old Jerusalem<span corresp="#note232" type="note_anchor">[ 232 ]</span></l>
     <l n="86">Were Jebusites<span corresp="#note233" type="note_anchor">[ 233 ]</span>; the town so called from them ;</l>
     <l n="87">And theirs the native right .——</l>
     <l n="88">But when the chosen people grew more strong ,</l>
     <l n="89">The rightful cause at length became the wrong ;</l>
     <l n="90">And every loss the men of Jebus bore ,</l>
     <l n="91">They still were thought God 's enemies the more .</l>
     <l n="92">Thus worn or<span corresp="#note234" type="note_anchor">[ 234 ]</span>weakened , well or ill content ,</l>
     <l n="93">Submit they must to David 's government ;</l>
     <l n="94">Impoverished and deprived of all command ,</l>
     <l n="95">Their taxes doubled as they lost their land ;</l>
     <l n="96">And , what was harder yet to flesh and blood ,</l>
     <l n="97">Their gods disgraced , and burnt like common wood .</l>
     <l n="98">This set the heathen priesthood in a flame ;</l>
     <l n="99">For priests of all religions are the same .</l>
     <l n="100">Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be ,</l>
     <l n="101">Stock , stone , or other homely pedigree ,</l>
     <l n="102">In his defence his servants are as bold ,</l>
     <l n="103">As if he had been born of beaten gold .</l>
     <l n="104">The Jewish rabbins , though their enemies ,</l>
     <l n="105">In this conclude them honest men and wise ;</l>
     <l n="106">For ‘ twas their duty , all the learned think ,</l>
     <l n="107">To espouse his cause , by whom they eat and drink .</l>
     <l n="108">From hence began that plot , the nation 's curse ,</l>
     <l n="109">Bad in itself , but represented worse ;<span corresp="#note235" type="note_anchor">[ 235 ]</span></l>
     <l n="110">Raised in extremes , and in extremes decried ;</l>
     <l n="111">With oaths affirmed , with dying vows denied ;</l>
     <l n="112">Not weighed nor winnowed by the multitude ,</l>
     <l n="113">But swallowed in the mass , unchewed and crude .</l>
     <l n="114">Some truth there was , but dashed and brewed with lies ,</l>
     <l n="115">To please the fools , and puzzle all the wise .</l>
     <l n="116">Succeeding times did equal folly call ,</l>
     <l n="117">Believing nothing , or believing all .</l>
     <l n="118">The Egyptian rites the Jebusites embraced ,</l>
     <l n="119">Where gods were recommended by their taste .</l>
     <l n="120">Such savoury deities must needs be good ,</l>
     <l n="121">As served at once for worship and for food .<span corresp="#note236" type="note_anchor">[ 236 ]</span></l>
     <l n="122">By force they could not introduce these gods ,—</l>
     <l n="123">For ten to one in former days was odds ,—</l>
     <l n="124">So fraud was used , the sacrificer 's trade ;</l>
     <l n="125">Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade .</l>
     <l n="126">Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews ,</l>
     <l n="127">And raked for converts even the court and stews ;</l>
     <l n="128">Which Hebrew priests the more unkindly took ,</l>
     <l n="129">Because the fleece accompanies the flock .</l>
     <l n="130">Some thought they God 's anointed meant to slay</l>
     <l n="131">By guns , invented since full many a day :</l>
     <l n="132">Our author swears it not ; but who can know</l>
     <l n="133">How far the devil and Jebusites may go ?<span corresp="#note237" type="note_anchor">[ 237 ]</span></l>
     <l n="134">This plot , which failed for want of common sense ,</l>
     <l n="135">Had yet a deep and dangerous consequence ;</l>
     <l n="136">For as , when raging fevers boil the blood ,</l>
     <l n="137">The standing lake soon floats into a flood ,</l>
     <l n="138">And every hostile humour , which before</l>
     <l n="139">Slept quiet in its channels , bubbles o'er ;</l>
     <l n="140">So several factions , from this first ferment ,</l>
     <l n="141">Work up to foam , and threat the government .</l>
     <l n="142">Some by their friends , more by themselves thought wise ,</l>
     <l n="143">Opposed the power to which they could not rise ;</l>
     <l n="144">Some had in courts been great , and , thrown from thence ,</l>
     <l n="145">Like fiends , were hardened in impenitence ;</l>
     <l n="146">Some , by their monarch 's fatal mercy , grown</l>
     <l n="147">From pardoned rebels kinsmen to the throne ,</l>
     <l n="148">Were raised in power and public office high ;</l>
     <l n="149">Strong bands , if bands ungrateful men could tie .</l>
     <l n="150">Of these the false Achitophel<span corresp="#note238" type="note_anchor">[ 238 ]</span>was first ;</l>
     <l n="151">A name to all succeeding ages curst :</l>
     <l n="152">For close designs , and crooked counsels fit ;</l>
     <l n="153">Sagacious , bold , and turbulent of wit ;</l>
     <l n="154">Restless , unfixed in principles and place ;</l>
     <l n="155">In power unpleased , impatient of disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="156">A fiery soul , which , working out its way , }</l>

     <l n="159">A daring pilot in extremity ;</l>
     <l n="160">Pleased with the danger , when the waves went high</l>
     <l n="161">He sought the storms ; but , for a calm unfit ,</l>
     <l n="162">Would steer too nigh the sands , to boast his wit .</l>
     <l n="163">Great wits are sure to madness near allied ,</l>
     <l n="164">And thin partitions do their bounds divide ;</l>

     <l n="175">To compass this the triple bond he broke ; }</l>
     <l n="176">The pillars of the public safety shook ; }</l>
     <l n="177">And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke ;<span corresp="#note240" type="note_anchor">[ 240 ]</span>}</l>
     <l n="178">Then , seized with fear , yet still affecting fame ,</l>

     <l n="180">So easy still it proves in factious times ,</l>
     <l n="181">With public zeal to cancel private crimes .</l>
     <l n="182">How safe is treason , and how sacred ill ,</l>
     <l n="183">Where none can sin against the people 's will ?</l>
     <l n="184">Where crowds can wink , and no offence be known ,</l>
     <l n="185">Since in another 's guilt they find their own ?</l>
     <l n="186">Yet fame deserved no enemy can grudge ;</l>
     <l n="187">The statesman we abhor , but praise the judge .</l>
     <l n="188">In Israel 's courts ne'er sat an Abethdin<span corresp="#note242" type="note_anchor">[ 242 ]</span></l>
     <l n="189">With more discerning eyes , or hands more clean ,</l>
     <l n="190">Unbribed , unsought , the wretched to redress ;</l>

     <l n="194">Or had the rankness of the soil been freed</l>
     <l n="195">From cockle , that oppressed the noble seed ;</l>

   <p>Queen Catherine of Portugal , the wife of Charles II ., resembled the daughter of Saul in the circumstance mentioned in the text . She was plain in her person , and consequently possessed little influence over her gallant husband . She was , however , always treated by him with decent civility ; and indeed , when persecuted by the popular party , experienced his warmest protection . Her greatest fault was her being educated a Catholic ; her greatest misfortune , her bearing the king no children ; and her greatest foible an excessive love of dancing . It might have occurred to the good people of these times , that loving a ball was not a capital sin , even in a person whose figure excluded her from the hopes of gracing it ; that a princess of Portugal must be a Catholic , if she had any religion at all ; and , finally , that to bear children , it is necessary some one should take the trouble of getting them . But these obvious considerations did not prevent her being grossly abused in the libels of the times ,<span corresp="#note294" type="note_anchor">[ 294 ]</span>and very nearly made a party in Dr Titus Oates ’ Appendix to his Original Plot .</p>

   <p>James Stuart , Duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch , was born at Rotterdam , 9th April , 1649 , in the very heat of the civil wars . He was the son of Charles II . and Mrs Lucy Walters , or Waters , otherwise called Barlow , a beautiful young lady , of a good Welch family . He was educated privately in Holland , under the assumed name of James Crofts ; and the respect with which his mother and he were treated by the cavalier , afforded a foundation for the argument of his adherents , who afterwards contended , that the king had been privately married to that lady . After the Restoration , the king sent for this young gentleman to court , where the royal favour and his own personal and acquired accomplishments soon made him very remarkable . Of his outward appearance , Count Hamilton , the gay recorder of the gaieties of the court of Charles , has given us a most interesting description , which is not belied by portraits which are still preserved . “ Nature , ” says the count , “ perhaps never formed any thing so perfect as the external graces of his person . ” His face was beautiful ; but it was a masculine beauty , unmixed with any thing weak or effeminate : each feature had its own peculiar and interesting turn of expression . He had admirable address in all active exercises , an attractive manner , and an air of princely majesty . Yet his mental qualities did not altogether support this prepossessing exterior ; or rather his fate plunged him into scenes where more was necessary than the mind and manners which , in more regular times , would have distinguished him as an accomplished cavalier in peace and war . He was married , by the king 's interference , to Anne Scott , Countess of Buccleuch , sole surviving child of Francis , Earl of Buccleuch , and heiress of the extensive estate which the powerful family she represented had acquired on the frontiers of Scotland . The young prince had been previously created Duke of Orkney , a title now changed for that of Monmouth ; and the king , upon his marriage , added to his honours the dukedom of Buccleuch . Thus favoured at home , he was also fortunate enough to have an opportunity of acquiring military fame , by serving two campaigns as a volunteer in Louis XIV . ' s army against the Dutch . He particularly distinguished himself at the siege of Maestricht , where he led the storming party , took possession of the counterscarp , and made good his quarters against the repeated and desperate attempts of the besieged to dislodge him . Monmouth also served a campaign with the Dutch against the French , in 1678 , and is on all hands allowed to have displayed great personal bravery ; especially in the famous attack on the Duke of Luxemburgh 's line before Mons , when the Prince of Orange , whose judgment can hardly be doubted , formed that good opinion of his military skill , which he stated when he offered to command the forces of his father-in-law against the Duke on his last unfortunate expedition . With that renown which is so willingly conferred upon the noble and the beautiful , the Duke returned to England , and met with a distinguished reception from Charles , by whom he was loaded with favours , as will appear from the following list of his titles and offices .</p>
   <p>He was Duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch ; Earl of Doncaster and Dalkeith ; Lord Scott of Tinedale , Whichester , and Eskdale ; Lord Great Chamberlain of Scotland , Lord-Lieutenant of the east Riding of Yorkshire ; Governor of the town and citadel of Kingston upon Hull ; Chief Justice in Eyre of all his Majesty 's forests , chases , parks , and warrens on the south side of the Trent ; Lord-General of all his Majesty 's land forces ; Captain of his Majesty 's Life-guards of horse ; Chancellor of the university of Cambridge ; Master of horse to the King ; one of the Lords of the Privy Council , and Knight of the order of the Garter .</p>
   <p>Thus highly distinguished by rank , reputation , and royal favour , he appears for some time to have dedicated himself chiefly to the pleasures of the court , when an unfortunate quarrel with the Duke of York , in the rivalry of an intrigue ,<span corresp="#note295" type="note_anchor">[ 295 ]</span>laid the foundation for that difference , which was one great means of embroiling the latter years of Charles 's reign , and finally cost Monmouth his head . When his quarrel with his uncle , whose unforgiving temper was well known , had become inveterate and irreconcileable , the Duke of Monmouth was led to head the faction most inimical to the interests of York , and speedily became distinguished by the name of the Protestant Duke , the dearest title that his party could bestow . The prospect which now opened itself before Monmouth was such as might have turned the head of a man of deeper political capacity . The heir apparent , his personal enemy , had become the object of popular hatred to such a degree , that the bill , excluding him from the succession , seemed to have every chance of being carried through the House of Lords , as it had already passed the Commons . The rights of the Queen were not likely to interest any one ; and it seems generally to have been believed , however unjustly as it proved , that Charles was too fond of Monmouth , too jealous of his brother , and too little scrupulous of ways and means , to hesitate at declaring this favourite youth his legitimate successor .</p>
   <p>Under such favourable circumstances , it is no wonder that Monmouth gave way to the dictates of ambition ; and while he probably conceived that he was only giving his father an opportunity to manifest his secret partiality , he became more and more deeply involved in the plots of Shaftesbury , whose bustling and intriguing spirit saw at once the use to be made of Monmouth 's favour with the king , and popularity with the public . From that time , their union became close and inseparable ; even while Shaftesbury was yet a member of the king 's administration . Their meetings were conducted with a secrecy and mystery which argued their importance . According to Carte , they were held at Lord Shaftesbury 's and Charleton 's houses , both parties coming in private , and in hackney coaches . Some of Monmouth 's partizans had even the boldness to assert the legitimacy of their patron , to prepare for his supplanting the Duke of York . When the insurrection of the Covenanters broke out in Scotland , Monmouth was employed against them , a duty which he executed with fidelity and success . He completely defeated the insurgents in the battle of Bothwell Bridge , and returned to the court in all the freshness of his laurels . This was in the year 1679 , and Monmouth 's good fortune had then attained its summit . He was beloved by the people , general of all the forces both in England and Scotland ; London was at the devotion of Shaftesbury , the Duke of York banished to Brussels , and universally detested on account of his religion . At this important moment Charles fell ill of a fever at Windsor . Had he died it is very probable that Monmouth would have found himself in a condition to agitate successfully a title to the crown . But either the king 's attachment to the Catholic religion , in the profession of which he finally died , or his sense of justice and hereditary right occasioned an extraordinary alteration of measures at this momentous crisis . The Duke of York was summoned from abroad , arrived at Windsor , and by his presence and activity at once resumed that ascendance over Charles , which his more stern genius had always possessed , and animated the sunken spirit of his own partizans . By a most sudden and surprising revolution , York was restored to all his brother 's favour . For although he was obliged to retire to Scotland to avoid the fury of the exclusionists , yet a sharper exile awaited his rival Monmouth , who , deprived of all his offices , was sent into the foreign banishment from which his uncle had just been recalled . Accordingly he retired to Holland , where he was courteously received by the States ; and where Charles himself appears to have been desirous , that his darling son should find an honourable asylum . Meanwhile the factions waxed still more furious ; and Shaftesbury , whose boast it was to “ ride in the whirlwind and direct the storm , ” utterly embroiled the kingdom , by persuading Monmouth to return to England without licence from his father , and to furnish an ostensible head to that body of which the wily politician was himself the soul . This conduct deeply injured Monmouth in his father 's favour , who refused to see him ; and , by an enquiry and subsequent declaration made openly in council , and published in the Gazette , endeavoured to put an end to his hopes , by publicly declaring his illegitimacy . Wonderful as it may seem , this avowal was ascribed to the king 's fear for his brother ; and two daring pamphlets were actually published , to assert the legitimacy of Monmouth , against the express and solemn declaration of his father .<span corresp="#note296" type="note_anchor">[ 296 ]</span>Monmouth himself , by various progresses through the kingdom , with an affectation of popularity which gained the vulgar but terrified the reflecting , above all , by a close alliance with the Machiavel , Shaftesbury , shewed his avowed determination to maintain his pretensions against those of the lawful successor . This was the state of parties in 1681 , when “ Absalom and Achitophel ” first appeared .</p>
   <p>The permission of so sharp a satire against the party of Monmouth , though much qualified as to his individual person , plainly shewed the king 's intention to proceed with energy against the country party . Monmouth , in the midst of one of those splendid journies which he had made to display his strength , was arrested at Stafford , September 20 , 1682 , and obliged to enter bail for his peaceable deportment and appearance when called on , to answer any suit against him by the king . In the mean while , the dubious and mysterious cabal , called the Rye-house Plot , was concocted by two separate parties , moving in some degree towards the same point , but actuated by very different motives , adopting different modes of conduct , and in their mutual intrigues but slightly connected with each other . It appears certain , that Monmouth utterly abominated the proposal of Rumbold , and those who made the assassination of the King and Duke of York the groundwork of their proposed insurrection . It is equally certain , that , with Sidney and Russell , he engaged in plans of reformation , or revolution , of that dubious description , which might have turned out good or evil , according to their power of managing the machine they were about to set in motion ; a power almost always over-rated till the awful moment of experiment . Upon the discovery of these proceedings , Monmouth absconded , but generously signified to Lord Russell his determination to surrender himself if it could serve his friend ; an offer which Russell , with the same generosity , positively rejected .</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the discovery which involved perhaps a charge of high treason , the king was so much convinced of Monmouth 's innocence , so far as the safety of his person was concerned , that the influence of Halifax , who always strove to balance the power of the Duke of York by that of his nephew , procured him an opportunity of being restored to the king 's favour , for which the minister had little thanks from the heir of the crown .<span corresp="#note297" type="note_anchor">[ 297 ]</span>But Monmouth , by an excess of imprudence , in which , however , he displayed a noble spirit , forfeited the advantages he might have obtained at this crisis . Although he signed an acknowledgment of his guilt , in listening to counsels which could not be carried into effect , without a restraint on the king 's person ; he would not , on reflection , authorize the publication of a declaration , which must have had a fatal influence on the impending trial of his friends . He demanded it back , and received it ; but accompanied with an order to leave the kingdom . He obeyed , and remained in honourable banishment in Holland , till after the accession of James II . to the throne . There is room to believe , that Monmouth would never have disturbed his uncle , had James not evinced a desire to follow him with vengeance even into his retreat . Wellwood has published a letter from him , in which he says , ambition is mortified within him , and expresses himself determined to live in retirement . But when the King insisted on the Prince of Orange driving him out of Holland , and proceeded to take measures to exclude him from Brussels , he appears to have become desperate . Even yet he prepared to retire to Sweden , but he was surrounded by fugitives from England and Scotland , who , as is always the case , represented the nation as agitated by their passions , and feeling for their individual oppression : Argyle , in particular , and the Scottish exiles , fired by the aggressions on their liberty and religion , anticipated a more warm support than they afterwards experienced .</p>
   <p>Monmouth , thus driven upon his fate , set sail with three ships ; landed at Lyme with hardly an hundred followers ; and , such was the magic of his popularity , soon found himself at the head of a considerable force . He baffled the Duke of Albemarle who attempted to coop him up at Lyme , and , advancing to Taunton took upon him fatally the title of King . At length , he surprised the Earl of Feversham , James 's general , in his entrenchments near Bridgewater ; and the native stubborn valour of his followers nearly proved too much for the discipline of the veterans , whom they attacked . The cowardice of Lord Grey ,<span corresp="#note298" type="note_anchor">[ 298 ]</span>who fled with the cavalry , led to a total defeat and much slaughter among Monmouth 's forces . Still more fell a sacrifice to the bloody zeal of the brutal Jefferies . The Duke himself was taken in his flight ; and , depressed by fatigue and disappointment , shewed some symptoms of weakness , inconsistent with his former character . He solicited his life by submissive letters to James , and , at length , obtained an interview with the king . But James forgot the noble , though homely popular saying ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A king 's face</l>
     <l n="2">Should give grace .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With the natural sternness of his character , he only strove to extort from Monmouth a disavowal of his legitimacy , and a confession of his accomplices . To the former the Duke submitted ; but , when urged to the latter , rose from the posture of supplication , and retorted with dignity the reproaches of James . When he returned to the Tower , he wrote a letter to the king , supposed to contain a secret , the revealing of which might have purchased his life . This letter he intrusted to Captain Scott of Dumbarton 's regiment , a descendant of the family of Harden , and , consequently , related to the Duchess of Monmouth . The famous Blood is said to have compelled Scott to deliver up the letter , and carried it to Sunderland , who destroyed it .<span corresp="#note299" type="note_anchor">[ 299 ]</span></p>
   <p>The Duke of Monmouth , finding all efforts to procure a pardon ineffectual , met death with great resolution . He smiled on the guards who surrounded the scaffold , and whom in his better days he had commanded ; bowed to the populace , who expressed by sighs and tears their interest in his fate ; and submitted to his doom . His death was cruelly prolonged by the hesitation of the executioner , who , after several ineffectual strokes of the axe , threw it down , and could scarcely be prevailed on to finish his bloody work . The execution took place on the 15th of July , 1685 .</p>
   <p>It would be difficult , were it here necessary , to draw a character of the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth . His qualities and accomplishments were fitted for times more gentle than those in which he lived , where he might be compared to a pleasure barge struggling against a hurricane . In gentler times , he had proved a successful leader in war ; and in peace , what the reviver of tragedy has aptly stiled , “ An honoured courtly gentleman . ” Count Basil . Act I . Scene II .</p>

   <p>And made the charming Annabel his bride .— P . 218 .</p>
   <p>Anne , Duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth , a lady of high spirit , great beauty , and unimpeachable honour . We have had repeated occasion to mention her in the course of these notes . She was reckoned the richest heiress in Europe ; as , upon the death of her elder sister , Anne Countess of Buccleuch , wife of Walter Earl of Tarras , she succeeded to the extensive land estate of that family . Charles made this advantageous match for his son , by the intervention of the young lady 's mother , the Countess of Wemyss . The Duchess of Buccleuch was a distinguished protectress of poetical merit , and evinced her discriminating taste , by early selecting Dryden as the object of her patronage ; she cultivated the friendship of the Duke of York , and established an intimacy between him and her husband , which paved the way for the advancement of the latter .<span corresp="#note300" type="note_anchor">[ 300 ]</span>When by an occasional rivalry they quarrelled , and became irreconcileable enemies , she still opposed her prudence to the precipitate counsels of Monmouth 's worse advisers . It is probable her influence saved his life , by determining him to make a timely confession , concerning all he knew of the Rye-house conspiracy , upon condition , it was not to be used against his friends . When he imprudently retracted that confession , her advice prevailed on him to offer a renewal of it .<span corresp="#note301" type="note_anchor">[ 301 ]</span>Their last interview before the Duke 's execution , is thus narrated in a MS. now before me .</p>
   <p>“ His behaviour all the time was brave and unmoved , and , even during the last conversation and farewell with his lady and children , which was the movingest scene in the world , and which no bye-standers could see without melting in tears , he did not shew the least concerndness . He declared before all the company , how averse the duchess had been to all his irregular courses , and that she had never been uneasy to him on any occasion whatsoever , but about women , and his failing of dutie to the late king . And that she knew nothing of his last designe , not having heard from himself a year before , which was his own fault , and noe unkindness in her , because she knew not how to direct her letters to him . In that , he gave her the kyndest character that could be , and begged her pardon of his many failings and offences to her , and prayed her to continue her kyndness and care to her poore children . At this expression she fell down on her knees , with her eyes full of teares , and begged him to pardon her if ever she had done any thing to offend and displease him ; and embracing his knees , fell into a swoon , out of which they had much adoe to raise her up in a good while after . A little before , his children were brought to him , all crying about him ; but he acquitted himself of these last adewes with much composure , shewing nothing of weakness and unmanliness . ” Account of the Actions and Behaviour of the Duke of Monmouth , from the time he was taken to his Execution , in a letter , dated July 16 , 1685 , MS ., in the Duke of Buccleuch 's library .</p>
   <p>The Duchess of Monmouth 's turn of mind , and her aversion to her husband 's political intrigues , lead me to imagine , that Dryden sketched out her character under that of Marmoutiere in “ the Duke of Guise ; ” whose expostulations with her lover apply exactly to the situation of this noble pair . If the Duke of Monmouth entertained a causeless jealousy of the intimacy of York with his lady , as the Duke of Buckingham seems to hint ,<span corresp="#note302" type="note_anchor">[ 302 ]</span>something like an allusion to this circumstance may be traced in the suspicions of Guise , and vindication of Marmoutiere .<span corresp="#note303" type="note_anchor">[ 303 ]</span></p>
   <p>The Duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth survived the catastrophe of her husband many years ; during which she was resolute in asserting her right to be treated as a princess of the blood . She had two surviving sons by Monmouth ; one of whom carried on the line of Buccleuch , and the other was created Earl of Deloraine . She was married a second time , in 1688 , to Lord Cornwallis , by whom she had two surviving daughters . The Duchess died in 1732 , in the eighty-first year of her life . King James made her Grace and her family a gift of all her original property , so far as forfeited by the Duke of Monmouth 's condemnation .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>There is a libel among the State Poems , relating to some obscure fray , in which the duke of Monmouth and some of his brothers appear to have been concerned . This was probably one of the youthful excesses alluded to .<span corresp="#note304" type="note_anchor">[ 304 ]</span>But Amnon 's murder seems to refer to the more noted assault upon sir John Coventry , which the reader may take in the words of Andrew Marvell .</p>
   <p>“ But an accident happened , which had like to have spoiled all . Sir John Coventry having moved ( in the house of commons ) for an imposition on the play houses , sir John Berkenhead , to excuse them , said they had been of great service to the king . Upon which , sir John Coventry desired that gentleman to explain “ whether he meant the men or women players ? "[ 305 ] Hereupon it is imagined , that the house adjourning from Tuesday , before , till Thursday after Christmas day , on the very Tuesday night of the adjournment , twenty-five of the duke of Monmouth 's troop ,<span corresp="#note306" type="note_anchor">[ 306 ]</span>and some few foot , laid in wait from ten at night , till two in the morning , and as he returned from the Cock , where he supped , to his own house , they threw him down , and with a knife cut off almost all the end of his nose ; but company coming , made them fearful to finish it ; so they marched off . Sir Thomas Sands , lieutenant of the troop , commanded the party , and Obrian , the earl of Inchequin 's son , was a principal actor . The court hereupon sometimes thought to carry it with a high hand , and question sir John for his words , and maintain the action ; sometimes they flagged in their councils . However , the king commanded sir Thomas Clarges , and sir W. Pulteney , to release Wroth , and Lake , who were two of the actors , and taken . But the night before the house met , they surrendered ( to ) him again . The house being but sullen the next day , the court did not oppose adjourning for some days longer , till it was filled . Then the house went upon Coventry 's business , and voted that they would go upon nothing else whatever , till they had passed a bill , as they did , for Sands , Obrian , Parry , and Reeves , to come in by the sixteenth of February , or else be condemned , and never to be pardoned , but by an express act of parliament , and their names therein inserted , for fear of being pardoned in some general act of grace . Farther , all such actions , for the future , on any man , felony without clergy ; and who shall otherwise strike or wound any parliament man , during his attendance , or going or coming , imprisonment for a year , treble damages , and incapacity . The bill having in some few days been despatched to the lords , the house has since gone on in grand committee upon the first 800 , 000l . bill , but are not yet half way . But now the lords , instead of the sixteenth of February , put twenty-five days after the king 's royal assent , and that registered in their journal ; they disagree in several other things , but adhere in that first which is material . So that , in this week , the houses will be in danger of splitting , without much wisdom or force . For , considering that sir Thomas Sands was the very person sent to Clarges and Pulteney , that Obrian was concealed in the duke of Monmouth 's lodgings , that Wroth and Lake were bailed at sessions , by order from Mr Attorney , and , that all persons and things are perfectly discovered , that act will not be passed without great consequence . ” Letter from Andrew Marvel , to William Romsden , in Marvel 's Works , Vol .

   <p>The Papist plot , like every criminal and mysterious transaction , where accomplices alone can give evidence , is involved in much mystery . It is well known , that the zeal for making proselytes , with all its good and all its evil consequences , is deeply engrafted upon the catholic faith . There can be no doubt , from Coleman 's correspondence , that there was in agitation , among the Catholics , a grand scheme to bring about the conversion of the British kingdoms to the Romish religion . Much seemed to favour this in the reign of Charles II . The king , though a latitudinarian , was believed addicted to the religion of those countries which had afforded him refuge in his adversity , and the Duke of York was an open and zealous Papist . From the letters of his secretary Coleman , it is obvious , that hopes were entertained of eradicating the great northern heresy ; and the real existence of intrigues carried on with this purpose , unfortunately gave a colour to the monstrous and absurd falsehoods which the witnesses of the plot contrived to heap together . It is probable , that Oates , by whom the affair was first started , knew nothing , but by vague report and surmise , of the real designs of the Roman catholic party ; since he would otherwise have accommodated his story better to their obvious interests . The catholics might gain much by the life of Charles ; but a plot to assassinate him , would have been far from placing them an inch nearer their point , even supposing them to escape the odium of so horrible a crime . The Duke , it was true , was nearest in blood ; but his succession to the throne , had the king been taken off by those of his sect , would have been a very difficult matter , since the very suspicion of such a catastrophe had nearly caused his exclusion . But when the faction involved the king also in the plot , which Oates positively charges upon him in his last publication , and thereby renders him an accessory before the fact to an attempt on his own life , the absurdity is fully completed . Even according to the statement of those who suppose that Charles had irritated the Roman catholics , by preferring his ease and quiet to their interest and his own religious feelings , his situation appears ludicrously distressing . For , on the one hand , he incurred the hatred of those who called themselves the Protestant party , for his obstinacy in exposing himself to be murdered by the papists ; and , on the other hand , he was to be assassinated by the catholics , for not doing what , according to this supposition , he himself most wished to do . It would be far beyond our bounds , to notice the numberless gross absurdities to which Oates and the other witnesses deposed upon oath . It may appear almost incredible , in the present day , how such extravagant fictions should be successfully palmed upon the deluded public ; but at that time there was not the same ready communication by the press , which now allows opportunity to canvass an extraordinary charge as soon as it is brought forward . The public at large had no means of judging of state matters , but from the bribed libellers of faction , and the haranguers in coffee-houses , who gave what colour they pleased to the public news of the day .<span corresp="#note307" type="note_anchor">[ 307 ]</span>Besides , the catholics had given an handle against themselves , by their own obscure intrigues ; and it was impossible to forget the desperate scheme of the Gunpowder Plot , by which they had resolved to cut off the heresy in the time of King James . The crime of the fathers was , in this case , visited on the children ; for no person probably would , or could , have believed in the catholic plot of 1678 , had not the same religious sect meditated something equally desperate in 1606 . It is true , the gunpowder conspiracy was proved by the most unexceptionable testimony ; and the plot in Charles ’ time rested on the oaths of a few boldfaced villains , who contradicted both themselves and each other ; but still popular credulity was prepared to believe any thing charged on a sect , who had shown themselves so devoted to their religious zeal , and so little scrupulous about means to gratify it . Another main prop of the Catholic plot was the mystery in which it was involved . If inconsistencies were pointed out , or improbabilities urged , the answer was , that the discovery had not yet reached the bottom of the plot . Thus the disposition of the vulgar to believe the atrocious and the marvellous , was heightened by the stimulus of ungratified curiosity , and still impending danger . “ Every new witness , ” says North , “ that came in , made us start — now we shall come to the bottom . And so it continued from one witness to another , year after year , till at length it had no bottom but in the bottomless pit . "[ 308 ] Thus , betwixt villainy and credulity , the spirits of the people were exasperated and kept afloat , till the bloodhounds of the plot , like those formerly used in pursuit of marauders , had drenched their scent , and annihilated their powers of quest in the best blood in the kingdom .</p>
   <p>The unfortunate victims , whose lives were sworn away by Oates and his accomplices , died averring their innocence ; but the infuriated people for some time gave little credit to this solemn exculpation ; believing that the religion of the criminals , or at least the injunctions of their priests , imposed on them the obligation of denying , with their last breath , whatever , if confessed , could have prejudiced the catholic cause . As all high wrought frenzies are incapable of duration , that of the Roman catholic plot decayed greatly after the execution of the venerable Stafford . The decent and manly sobriety of his demeanour on the scaffold , the recollection of how much blood had been spilled , and how much more might be poured out like water , excited the late and repentant commiseration of the multitude : His protestations of innocence were answered by broken exclamations of “ God bless you , my lord ! we believe you . ” And after this last victim , the Popish plot , like a serpent which had wasted its poison , though its wreaths entangled many , and its terrors held their sway over more , did little effectual mischief . Even when long lifeless , and extinguished , this chimera , far in the succeeding reigns , continued , like the dragon slain by the Red-cross Knight , to be the object of popular fear , and the theme of credulous terrorists :</p>

   <p>The author alludes to the wonderful project to assassinate the king by Pickering and Groves , to which Oates bore testimony . Pickering , a man in easy circumstances , and whom religious zeal alone induced to murder his sovereign , was to have 30 , 000 masses ; and Groves , a more mercenary ruffian , was to be recompensed with a sum , which , reckoning at a shilling a mass , should be an equivalent in money . But this scheme misgave , because , according to the evidence , the conscientious and opulent Mr Pickering had furnished himself for the exploit with an old pistol , the cock whereof was too loose to hold a flint . Another time they were to come to Windsor , to execute their bloody purpose with sword and dagger ; but could find no better conveyance than miserable hack horses , one of which became lame , and disconcerted the expedition . Such at least was the apology made by Oates for their not appearing , when a party were , upon his information , stationed to apprehend them .</p>

   <p>Anthony , Earl of Shaftesbury , one of the principal heroes of this poem , was in the Tower when it was published , and very soon after was served with a bill of indictment for high treason ; which was thrown out by the grand jury , who returned a verdict of Ignoramus . This gave rise to our author 's next poem , “ The Medal , ” and in the notes is contained some account of his lordship 's life , to which the reader is referred for further information . We have already stated , that he was the counsellor of Monmouth , and the very soul of his party . Nothing can be more exquisitely satirical than the description which Dryden has here given of this famous statesman .</p>

   <p>Anthony Ashley Cooper , second Earl of Shaftesbury , and son of the great statesman , whom Dryden has dubbed his Achitophel . The contemptuous language used towards him , is said not to have reference to his outward appearance ; for the portraits which remain represent him at uncommonly handsome . Nay , so much was his personal beauty an object of his attention , that he is said to have hastened his decease by his solicitude to remove , by violent means , an excrescence which disfigured his face . But the authority , from which these circumstances are quoted , seems to admit , that he was of a very insignificant character , at least not at all distinguished by mental abilities . Biographia Britannica , Vol . IV . p. 266 . His want of capacity was a standing joke among the Tories . In an ironical pamphlet , called “ A modest Vindication of the Earl of Shaftesbury , in a letter to a friend concerning his being elected King of Poland , ” we have , among the list of his officers of the crown , “ Prince Prettyman Perkinoski ( i. e . Monmouth ) , our adopted heir , because a little wiser than our own son , and designed to be offered to the diet as our successor . ”</p>
   <p>It often happens , that men are more jealous of their own , or their ancestors ’ reputation for talents , than for virtue . The third Earl of Shaftesbury , author of the “ Characteristics , ” is said to have resented more deeply this occasional attack on his father 's understanding , than the satire against his grandfather , in which Dryden has poured forth his whole energy . This passage is alleged to have been the occasion of his mentioning Dryden disrespectfully in several places of his works ; a revenge more dishonourable to his Lordship 's taste than to the object of his spleen .<span corresp="#note309" type="note_anchor">[ 309 ]</span></p>

   <p>The Earl of Shaftesbury is allowed to have been a principal adviser of the Dutch war in 1672 ; by which the triple alliance between England , Sweden , and Holland , the chef d'œuvre of Sir William Temple 's negociation , by which France and Spain were forced into the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle , was for ever broken . It was he who applied to Holland the famous saying , Delenda est Carthago ; and who , with all his wit and eloquence , furthered a closer connection with France , to the destruction of our natural ally . But when the success of the Dutch war was inferior to the expectations of this ardent statesman , when he found himself rivalled by Clifford and others in the favour of Charles , and when he perceived that the king , to preserve his quiet , would not hesitate to sacrifice an obnoxious minister , he chose to make what some of his biographers have called a short turn ; and , by going over to the popular party , to escape the odium attached to the measures he had himself recommended .</p>

   <p>In 1672 , the seals were given to the Earl of Shaftesbury , on the resignation of the Lord Keeper , Sir Orlando Bridgeman ; and he was invested with the office of Lord High Chancellor . In the judicial part of his duty , he appears to have merited the eulogium so elegantly expressed in the text . One of his biographers uses the following strong expressions : “ With what prudence and candour , honour , and integrity , he acquitted himself in that great and weighty employment , the transactions of the Court of Chancery , during the time of his chancellorship , will best testify . Justice , then , ran in an equal channel ; so that the cause of the rich was not suffered to swallow up the rights of the poor , nor was the strong or cunning oppressor permitted to devour the weak or unskilful opposer : but the abused found relief suitable to their distress ; and those by whom they were abused , a severe reprehension , answerable to their crimes . The mischievous consequences , which commonly arise from the delays and other practices of that court , were , by his ingenious and judicious management , very much abated , and every thing weighed and determined with such an exact judgment and equity , that it almost exceeds all possibility of belief . "[ 310 ] Yet even in this high situation , Shaftesbury could not help displaying something of a temper more lively and freakish than was consistent with the gravity of his place . His dress was an odd mixture of the courtier and lawyer ; being an ash-coloured gown , silver-laced , with pantaloons garnished with ribbons ; nothing being black about him , save , peradventure , his hat , which North , though he saw him , cannot positively affirm to have been so .<span corresp="#note311" type="note_anchor">[ 311 ]</span>Besides , he occasioned much dismay and discomfiture upon the first day of the term , which succeeded his appointment , by obliging the judges , law officers , &amp; c. who came , as usual , to attend the great seal to Westminster-hall , to make this solemn procession on horseback , according to ancient custom . As long as the cavalcade was in the open street , this did well enough ; but when they came to strait passages and interruptions , “ for want of gravity in the beasts , and too much in the riders , there happened some curvetting , which made no small disorder . Judge Twisden , to his great affright , and the consternation of his grave brethren , was laid all along in the dirt ; but all at length arrived safe , without loss of life or limb in the service . "[ 312 ] This whimsical fancy of setting grave judges on managed horses , with hazard both of damage and ridicule , to say nothing of bodily distress and terror , is a curious trait of the mercurial Earl of Shaftesbury .</p>

   <p>As it was pretty well understood that Charles was friendly to the Catholic religion , which indeed he had secretly embraced , no pains were spared to point out this tendency to the people , who connected with the faith of Rome all the bugbear horrors of the plot , as well as the real reasons which they had to dread its influence . Dryden probably alludes to the language held by Colledge , which was that of his party . Smith deposed against him , that , while he was carrying him to dine with one Alderman Willcox , he told him , “ He was a man as true as steel , and a man that would endeavour to root out Popery . ’ — Says I , ‘ That may be easily done , if you can but prevail with the king to pass the bill against the duke of York . ’ — ‘ No , no , ( said he ) now you are mistaken , for Rowley is as great a papist as the duke of York is , ( now he called the king , Rowley ,) and every way as dangerous to the Protestant interest , as is too apparent by his arbitrary ruling . ” — State Trials , Vol . iii . p. 359 .</p>

   <p>The legitimacy of the duke of Monmouth , though boldly and repeatedly asserted by his immediate partizans , did not receive general credit even in the popular faction . It was one of Shaftesbury 's principal advantages , to have chosen , for the ostensible head of his party , a candidate , whose right , had he ever attained the crown , must have fluctuated betwixt an elective and hereditary title . The consciousness of how much he was to depend upon Shaftesbury 's arts , for stating and supporting so dubious a claim , obliged the duke to remain at the devotion of that intriguing politician . It seems to have been shrewdly suspected by some of Monmouth 's friends , that Shaftesbury had no real intention of serving his interest . A poem , written by one of Monmouth 's followers , called “ Judah Betrayed , or the Egyptian Plot turned on the Israelites , ” expresses their fears , and very plainly intimates this suspicion : and the reader may bear with some bad poetry , to be convinced how far this faction was from being firmly united together :</p>

   <p>In 1679 , when the antipathy to popery had taken the deepest root in men 's minds , the House of Commons passed a vote , “ That the Duke of York 's being a papist , and the hopes of his coming to the crown , had given the highest countenance to the present conspiracies and designs of the papists , against the king and the protestant religion . ” Charles endeavoured to parry the obvious consequences of this vote , by proposing to the council a set of limitations , which deprived his successor , if a catholic , of the chief branches of royalty . Shaftesbury , then president of the council , argued against this plan as totally ineffectual ; urging , that when the future king should find a parliament to his mind , the limitations might be as effectually taken off as they could be imposed . When the bill was brought in , for the total exclusion of the Duke of York from the succession , Shaftesbury favoured it with all his influence . It passed the Lower House by a very large majority , but was rejected by the House of Lords , where Halifax opposed it with very great ability . Shaftesbury , who had taken so decided a part against the Duke of York in his dearest interests , was now irreconcilable with him , and could only look for safety in his ruin .</p>

   <p>If we can believe the honourable Roger North , Lord Shaftesbury made a fair experiment , for the purpose of ascertaining whether Charles 's love of ease and affection for Monmouth would induce him to consent to an alteration of the succession in his favour , to the prejudice of the Duke of York . He quotes a pamphlet , called , “ The Earl of Shaftesbury 's expedient to settle the nation , discoursed with his Majesty at Oxford , 24 March , 1681 , ” which gives the following account of the transaction ; and , as it was published at the time , and remained uncontradicted , either by Shaftesbury , or the king , probably contains some essential truth . The Earl of Shaftesbury having received , or pretended to receive , an unsigned letter , in a disguised hand , bustled away to court , “ as hard , ” says the pamphleteer , “ as legs , stick , and man could carry him . ” When he arrived there , the Lord Chamberlain conceiving the Duke of Monmouth might be in the secret , applied to him to know what the great concern was . His grace answered , with an appearance of hesitation , that it was something relating to himself , in which , as in other affairs of his , Lord Shaftesbury took a deeper concern than he desired . Meanwhile . Shaftesbury was introduced to the audience he solicited with the king , and produced the letter , containing , as he said , a plan for settling the interests of religion and state , which proved to be a proposal for calling the Duke of Monmouth to the succession . The king answered , he was surprized such a plan should be pressed upon him , after all the declarations he had made on the subject , and that , far from being more timorous , he became more resolute the nearer he approached his grave . Shaftesbury expressing great horror at such an expression , the king assured him he was no less anxious for his own preservation , than those who pretended to so much concern for the security of his person ; and yet , that he would rather lay down his life than alter the true succession of the crown , against both law and conscience . For that , said the earl , let us alone ; we will make a law for it . To which the king replied , that , if such was his lordship 's conscience , it was not his ; and that he did not think even his life of sufficient value to be preserved with the forfeiture of his honour , and essential injury to the laws of the land .— North 's Examen , p. 100 . 123 .</p>

   <p>Before James went to Flanders , he had testified a jealousy of Monmouth . “ The Duke of York , before he went abroad , ” says Carte , “ was concerned to see that the king could observe his frequent whispers at court to the Lord Shaftesbury , without being moved or expressing his dislike of it , but was much more alarmed at hearing of their frequent and clandestine meetings , without any apparent dissatisfaction expressed by his Majesty . ” p. 493. vol .

   <p>This inimitable description refers , as is well known , to the famous George Villiers , Duke of Buckingham , son of the favourite of Charles I ., who was murdered by Felton . The Restoration put into the hands of the most lively , mercurial , ambitious , and licentious genius , who ever lived , an estate of 20 , 000l a-year , to be squandered in every wild scheme which the lust of power , of pleasure , of licence , or of whim , could dictate to an unrestrained imagination . Being refused the situation of President of the North , he was suspected of having favoured the disaffected in that part of England , and was disgraced accordingly . But , in 1666 , he regained the favour of the king , and became a member of the famous administration called the Cabal , which first led Charles into unpopular and arbitrary measures , and laid the foundation for the troubles of his future reign . Buckingham changed sides about 1675 , and , becoming attached to the country party , made a most active figure in all proceedings which had relation to the Popish plot ; intrigued deeply with Shaftesbury , and distinguished himself as a promoter of the bill of exclusion . Hence , he stood an eminent mark for Dryden 's satire ; which , we may believe , was not the less poignant , that the poet had sustained a personal affront , from being depicted by his grace under the character of Bayes in the Rehearsal . As Dryden owed the Duke no favour , he has shewn him none . Yet , even here , the ridiculous , rather than the infamous part of his character , is touched upon ; and the unprincipled libertine , who slew the Earl of Shrewsbury while his adulterous countess held his horse in the disguise of a page , and who boasted of caressing her before he changed the bloody cloaths in which he had murdered her husband ,<span corresp="#note314" type="note_anchor">[ 314 ]</span>is not exposed to hatred , while the spendthrift and castle-builder are held up to contempt . So just , however , is the picture drawn by Dryden , that it differs little from the following sober historical character .</p>
   <p>“ The Duke of Buckingham was a man of great parts , and an infinite deal of wit and humour ; but wanted judgement , and had no virtue , or principle of any kind . These essential defects made his whole life one continued train of inconsistencies . He was ambitious beyond measure , and implacable in his resentments ; these qualities were the effects , or different faces of his pride ; which , whenever he pleased to lay aside , no man living could be more entertaining in conversation . He had a wonderful talent in turning all things into ridicule ; but , by his own conduct , made a more ridiculous figure in the world , than any other he could , with all his vivacity of wit , and turn of imagination , draw of others . Frolick and pleasure took up the greatest part of his life ; and in these he neither had any taste , nor set himself any bounds ; running into the wildest extravagancies , and pushing his debaucheries to a height , which even a libertine age could not help censuring as downright madness . He inherited the best estate which any subject had at that time in England ; yet , his profuseness made him always necessitous ; as that necessity made him grasp at every thing that would help to support his expences . He was lavish without generosity , and proud without magnanimity ; and , though he did not want some bright talents , yet , no good one ever made part of his composition ; for there was nothing so mean that he would not stoop to , nor any thing so flagrantly impious , but he was capable of undertaking . "[ 315 ]</p>
   <p>A patron like Buckingham , who piqued himself on his knowledge of literature , and had the means , if not the inclination , to be liberal , was not likely to want champions , such as they were , to repel the sharp attack of Dryden . Elkanah Settle compliments him with the following lines in his “ Absalom Senior , ” some of which are really tolerable .</p>

   <p>Buckingham himself , smarting under the severity of Dryden 's satire , strove to answer it in kind . He engaged in this work with more zeal and anger , than wit or prudence . It is one thing to write a farce , and another to support such a controversy with such an author . The Duke 's pamphlet , however , sold at a high price , and had a celebrity , which is certainly rather to be imputed to the rank and reputation of the author , than to the merit of the performance . As it is the work of such an applauded wit , is exceedingly scarce , and relates entirely to the poem which I am illustrating , I shall here insert the introduction , and some extracts from the piece itself .</p>
   <p>It is entitled “ Poetic Reflections on a late Poem , entituled , Absalom and Achitophel , by a Person of Honour . London , printed for Richard Janeway , 1682 . ( 14 December . ) ”</p>
   <p>To the Reader .— “ To epitomize which scandalous pamphlet , unworthy the denomination of poesy , no eye can inspect it without a prodigious amazement , the abuses being so gross and deliberate , that it seems rather a capital or national libel , than personal exposures , in order to an infamous detraction . For how does he character the King , but as a broad figure of scandalous inclinations , or contrived into such irregularities , as renders him rather the property of parasites and vice , than suitable to the accomplishment of so excellent a prince . Nay , he forces on king David such a royal resemblance , that he darkens his sanctity , in spite of illuminations from holy writ .</p>
   <p>“ Next , to take as near our king as he could , he calumniates the Duke of Monmouth , with that height of impudence , that his sense is far blacker than his ink , exposing him to all the censures that a murderer , a traitor , or what a subject of most ambitious evil can possibly comprehend .</p>
   <p>“ As to my Lord Shaftesbury , in his collusive Achitophel , what does he other than exceed malice itself , or that the more prudent deserts of that Peer were to be so impeached before hand by his impious poem , as that he might be granted more emphatically condign of the hangman 's axe , and which his muse does in effect take upon her to hasten .</p>
   <p>“ And if the season be well observed when this adulterate poem was spread , it will be found purposely divulged near the time when this lord , with his other noble partner , were to be brought to their trial ; and , I suppose this poet thought himself enough assured of their condemnation , at least that his genius had not otherwise ventured to have trampled on persons of such eminent abilities and interest in the nation ; a consideration , I confess , incited my pen , its preceding respect being paid to the duke of Monmouth , to vindicate their reputations where I thought it due .</p>

   <p>The Earl of Huntington . A coarse reason is given by Luttrel in his MS. notes , for the epithet by which he is distinguished in the text .<span corresp="#note321" type="note_anchor">[ 321 ]</span>He was one of the seventeen peers who signed a petition , beseeching Charles to have recourse to the advice of his parliament ; and he himself presented it at Whitehall , on the 7th of December , 1679 , in the name of the other lords subscribing . This advice was received very coldly by the king , who answered , “ That he would consider of what they had offered , and could heartily wish , that all other people were as solicitous for the peace and good of the nation , as he would ever be . ” The Earl of Huntington also subscribed the petition and advice , presented by fifteen peers to the king , against removing the parliament to Oxford ; where they stated , “ Neither Lords nor Commons can be in safety , but will be daily exposed to the swords of the Papists , and their adherents , of whom too many are crept into your majesty 's guards . ” Yet Lord Huntington did not go all the lengths of the Whig party . He became a privy councillor , was admitted to the honour of kissing the king 's hand , and was stated in the Public Intelligencer , of the 25th of October , 1681 , to have then confessed , that he had found by experience , “ That they who promoted the bill of exclusion , were for the subversion of monarchy itself . ” Monmouth , Grey , and Herbert , state , in a paper published on this occasion , that Lord Huntington had denied the utterance of the said words ; but , from the stile of their manifesto , it is obvious , they no longer regarded him as attached to their party .

   <p>He appears to have been a man of very great indifference to his domestic concerns ; as the Duke of Monmouth , under whose banners he enlisted himself , was generally believed to have an intrigue with Lady Grey . In an account of a mock apparition , which that lady is supposed to witness , she is made to state , “ That on Saturday , the 29th of January , 1680 , being alone in her closet about nine o'clock at night , she heard a voice behind her , which mildly said , sweetheart . At which she was at first not at all frightened , supposing it to be an apparition , which she says has often of late appeared to her in the absence of her lord , in the shape of a bright star and blue garter , but without hurting , or so much as frightening her . ” Lord Grey , ignorant or indifferent about these scandalous reports , went step for step with Monmouth in all his projects . He was a man of a restless temper , and lively talents , which he exercised in the service of the popular party . He was deep in the Rye-house Plot , and probably engaged in the very worst part of it ; at least , Lord Howard deposed , that Grey was full of expectation of some great thing to be attempted on the day of the king 's coming from Newmarket , which was that fixed by the inferior conspirators for his assassination . Upon the trial of Lord Russel , Howard was yet more particular , and said , that upon a dark intimation of an attempt on the king 's person , the Duke of Monmouth , “ with great emotion , struck his breast , and cried out , ‘ God so ! kill the king ! I will never suffer them . ’ That Lord Grey , with an oath , also observed upon it , that if they made such an attempt , they could not fail . ” Ramsey charged Lord Grey with arguing with Ferguson , on the project of the rising at Taunton . Grey , on the first discovery of this conspiracy , was arrested , but , filling the officers drunk , he escaped in a boat , and fled into Holland . He was afterwards very active in pushing on Monmouth to his desperate expedition in 1685 . He landed with the duke at Lyme , and held the rank of general of horse in his army . Like many other politicians , his lordship proved totally devoid of that courage in executing bold plans , which he displayed in forming or abetting them . At the first skirmish at Bridport he ran away , although the troops he commanded did not follow his example , but actually gained a victory , while he returned on the gallop to announce a total defeat . Monmouth , much shocked , asked Colonel Mathews what he should do with him ? who answered , he believed there was not another general in Europe would have asked such a question . Lord Grey , however , fatally for Monmouth , continued in his trust , and commanded the horse at the battle of Sedgemore . There he behaved like a poltroon as formerly , fled with the whole cavalry , and left the foot , who behaved most gallantly , to be cut to pieces by the horse of King James , who , without amusing themselves with pursuit , wheeled , and fell upon the rear of the hardy western peasants . So infamous was Grey 's conduct , that many writers at the time , thinking mere cowardice insufficient to account for it , have surmised , some , that he was employed by the king to decoy Monmouth to his destruction ; and others , that jealousy of the domestic injury he had received from the duke , induced him to betray the army .<span corresp="#note322" type="note_anchor">[ 322 ]</span>This caitiff peer was taken in the disguise of a shepherd , near Holt Lodge , in Dorsetshire ; and confessed , that “ since his landing in England , he had never enjoyed a quiet meal , or a night 's repose . ” He was conveyed to London , and would probably have been executed , had it not been discovered , that his estate , which had been given to Lord Rochester , was so strictly entailed , that nothing could be got by his death . He , therefore , by the liberal distribution , it is said , of large sums of money , received a pardon from the king , and appeared as a witness on the trial of Lord Delamere ; and was ready to do so on that of Hampden ; yet he is supposed to have kept some secrets with respect to the politics of the Prince of Orange , in reward of which , he was raised to the rank of an Earl after the Revolution .— Dalrymple 's Memoirs , Vol . I. p. 185 .</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the attribute which Dryden has ascribed to Lord Grey in this poem , he afterwards proved a man of unprincipled gallantry ; and 23d of November , 1682 , was tried in the King 's Bench for debauching lady Henrietta Berkeley , daughter of the Earl of Berkeley , to whose sister , lady Mary , he was himself married .

   </lg>
   <p>Lord Howard of Escricke , although an abandoned debauchee , made occasional pretensions to piety . He was an intimate of Shaftesbury and of Monmouth , but detested by Russel on account of the infamy of his character . Plots , counter-plots , and sham-plots , were at this time wrought like mine and countermine by each party , under the other 's vantage-ground . One Fitzharris had written a virulent libel against the court party , which he probably intended to father upon the whigs ; but being seized by Sir William Waller , he changed his note , and averred , that he had been employed by the court to write this libel , and to fix it upon the exclusionists ; and to this probable story he added , ex mera gratia , a new account of the old Popish Plot . The court resolved to make an example of Fitzharris ; they tried and convicted him of treason , for the libel fell nothing short of it . When condemned , finding his sole resource in the mercy of the crown , he retracted his evidence against the court , and affirmed , that Treby , the recorder , and Bethel and Cornish , the two sheriffs , had induced him to forge that accusation ; and that Lord Howard was the person who drew up instructions , pointing out to him what he was to swear , and urging him so to manage his evidence , as to criminate the Queen and the Duke of York . The confession of Fitzharris did not save his life , although he adhered to it upon the scaffold . Lord Howard , as involved in this criminal intrigue , was sent to the Tower , where he uttered and published a canting declaration , asserting his innocence , upon the truth of which he received the sacrament . He is said , however , to have taken the communion in lamb 's wool , ( i. e. ale poured on roasted apples and sugar ,) to which profanation Dryden alludes , with too much levity , in the second line above quoted . The circumstance is also mentioned in “ Absalom 's IX Worthies : ”</p>

     <l n="4">To erect his Paschal-lamb'shYpppHeNwoolhYpppHeNsacrament .</l>

   <p>Lord Howard was at length set at liberty from the Tower , upon finding bail , when he engaged under Shaftesbury , and ran into all the excesses of the party . Being deeply involved in the Rye-house Plot , he fled upon the discovery of that affair , and was detected in his shirt , covered with soot , in a chimney ; a sordid place of concealment , which well suited the spirit of the man . A tory ballad-maker has the following strain of prophetic exultation on Howard 's commitment :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Next valiant and noble Lord Howard ,</l>
     <l n="2">That formerly dealt in lambs-wool ;</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Accustomed to tamper with evidence , Howard did not hesitate to contaminate the noblest name in England , by practising the meannesses and villainies he had taught to others . For the sake of his shameful life , he bore witness against Russel and Sidney to all he knew , and probably to a great deal more . The former had always hated and despised Howard , and had only been induced to tolerate his company by the persuasions of Essex : The recollection , that , by introducing his best friend to the contagion of such company , he had , in fact , prepared his ruin , was one of the reasons assigned for that unfortunate peer 's remorse and suicide .</p>

   <p>Sir William Jones was an excellent lawyer , and , in his private character , an upright , worthy , and virtuous man ; in his religion he had some tendency to nonconformity , and his political principles were of the popular cast . He was the king 's attorney-general , and as such conducted all the prosecutions against those concerned in the Popish plot . He was , or affected to be , so deeply infected by the epidemic terror excited by this supposed conspiracy , that he had all his billets removed from his cellar , lest the Papists should throw in fire-balls , and set his house on fire . He closed , nevertheless , with the court , in an attempt to prohibit coffee-houses , on account of the facility which they afforded in propagating faction and scandal ; for this , he was threatened by the country party with an impeachment in parliament . Sir William Jones shortly after resigned his office under government , and went into open opposition . He distinguished himself particularly , by supporting the bill of exclusion , and by a violent speech in the Oxford parliament , on the subject of the clerk 's mislaying the Bill for repealing the 35th of Elizabeth , an act against dissenters . He was on his legs , as the phrase is , in the same house , arguing vehemently on the subject of Fitzharris , when the Black Rod knocked at the door , to announce the sudden and unexpected dissolution of the parliament . A well written pamphlet , entitled , “ Advice to Grand Juries , ” which appeared on the eve of the presentment against Shaftesbury , is said to have had some effect in producing the ignoramus verdict , on that bill .</p>
   <p>Sir William Jones is said to have regretted the share he took in the prosecutions on account of the plot ; which is extremely probable , as his excellent talents , and sound legal principles , could not fail , when clamour and alarm were over , to teach him how far he had been misled . His anxiety for the situation of the country is supposed to have accelerated his death , which took place in 1682 , at Mr Hampden 's house , in Buckingham-shire .</p>

   <p>Slingsby Bethel was son of Sir Walter Bethel , knight , by Mary , daughter of Sir Henry Slingsby of Scriven , in Yorkshire , and sister to Sir Henry Slingsby , a steady loyalist , who was condemned by Cromwell 's high court of justice , and beheaded on Towerhill in 1655 . Bethel was early attached to the fanatical interest , both by religious and political tenets ; he was even a member of the Committee of Safety . But he was a staunch republican , and no friend to the Protector ; being , it is believed , the author of that famous treatise , entitled “ The World 's Mistake in Oliver Cromwell . ” He was elected sheriff , with Cornish , on Midsummer-day 1680 , and the choice was , in many respects , disadvantageous to the popular party . In the first place , they were both Independents ; and , before taking upon them their offices , they conformed , and took the sacrament according to the church of England 's ritual . It was believed , that nothing but the necessity of qualifying themselves to serve their party in this office , could have prevailed on them to have done so , and this gave advantages against their whole party . Besides , Cornish was a downright , plain-spoken republican , and Bethel had expressed himself very bluntly in justification of the execution of Charles I .; and was , therefore , obnoxious to every slur which the royalists could bring against him , as ill-disposed to monarchy . Further still , Bethel 's extreme and sordid meanness gave great disgust to the citizens , who were accustomed to consider the exercise of a splendid and ostentatious hospitality as the principal part of a sheriff 's duty . He kept no table , lived in a chop-house , and , long afterwards , whoever neglected to entertain during his shrievalty , was said to “ Bethel the city . ” Bethel is mentioned among the subjects of deprecation in “ The Loyal Litany : ”</p>

   <p>These two sheriffs first set the example of packing juries , when persons were to be tried for party offences ; for they took the task of settling the pannels for juries out of the Compters into their own hands , and left the secondaries of the Compters , who had usually discharged that duty , only to return the lists , thus previously made up . In Middlesex , they had the assistance of Goodenough , the under-sheriff , a bustling and active partizan , who very narrowly escaped being hanged for the Rye-house Plot . By this selection of jurymen , the sheriffs insured a certainty of casting such bills as might be presented to the Grand Jury against any of their partizans . This practice was so openly avowed , that Settle has ventured to make it a subject of eulogy :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Next Hethriel write Baal 's watchful foe , and late</l>
     <l n="2">Jerusalem 's protecting magistrate ;</l>
     <l n="3">Who , when false jurors were to frenzy charmed ,</l>

     <l n="5">Saw depraved justice ope her ravenous maw ,</l>
     <l n="6">And timely broke her canine teeth of law .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Earl of Shaftesbury himself reaped the advantage of this manœuvre ; which , from the technical word employed in the return of these bills , was called Ignoramus . Stephen Colledge , the Protestant joiner , also experienced the benefit of a packed jury , though concerned in all the seditious practices of the time . He was afterwards tried , condemned , and executed at Oxford , where he was out of the magic circle of the sheriff 's protection ; and , though I believe the man deserved to die , he certainly at last met with hard measure . His death was supposed to have broke the talisman of Ignoramus , and was considered as a triumph by the Tories , who , for a long time , had been unable to persuade a jury to find for the king .<span corresp="#note323" type="note_anchor">[ 323 ]</span>When Lord Stafford was most unjustly condemned , Bethel and his brother sheriff affected a barbarous scruple , whether the king was entitled to commute the statutory punishment of high treason into simple decapitation . The House of Commons ordered that the king 's writ be obeyed . This hard-hearted conduct was an indulgence of their republican humour . Shortly after , Mr Bethel was found guilty of a riot and assault upon one of the king 's watermen at the election of members of parliament for Southwark , 5th October , 1681 . This person being active in the poll , Mr Bethel caned him , and told him he would have his coat ( the king 's livery ) stripped over his ears . For this he was fined five merks . Bethel , notwithstanding his violence , was so fortunate as to escape the business of the Rye-house Plot . His brother sheriff , Cornish , was not so fortunate : He was a plain republican , and highly esteemed by Lord Russell , for having treated with indifference the apprehension of the Tower firing on the city , saying , they could only demolish a few chimneys . He was executed as an accomplice in the Rye-house conspiracy , upon the evidence of that very Goodenough , who had been his tool in packing the illegal juries ; so that his death seemed a retribution for dishonouring and perverting the course of justice . James II . was afterwards satisfied that Cornish had been unjustly executed , and restored his estate to his family .</p>

   <p>Titus Oates , once called and believed the Saviour of his country , was one of the most infamous villains whom history is obliged to record . He was the son of an anabaptist ribbon-weaver , received a tolerably good education , and , having taken orders , was preferred to a small vicarage in Kent . Here the future protestant witness was guilty of various irregularities , for which he was at length silenced by the bishop , and by the Duke of Norfolk deprived of his qualification as chaplain . At this pinching emergency he became a papist , either for bread , or , as he afterwards boasted , for the purpose of insinuating himself into the secrets of the Jesuits , and betraying them .<span corresp="#note324" type="note_anchor">[ 324 ]</span></p>
   <p>The Jesuits setting little store by their proselyte , whose talents lay only in cunning and impudence , he skulked about St Omers and other foreign seminaries in a miserable condition . Undoubtedly he had then the opportunity of acquiring that list of names of the order of Jesus with which he graced his plot , and might perhaps hear something generally of the plans , which these intriguing churchmen hoped to carry through in England by means of the Duke of York . Of these , however , he must have had a very imperfect suspicion ; for the scheme which is displayed in the letters of Coleman , the duke 's secretary , does not at all quadrate with the doctor 's pretended discovery . When confronted with Coleman , he did not even know him personally . When the king asked him about the personal appearance of Don John of Austria , he described him , at a venture , as a tall thin black man , being the usual Spanish figure and complexion ; but , unfortunately , he was little , fair , and fat . In a word , it was impossible such a villain could have obtained a moment 's credit , but for the discovery of Coleman 's actual intrigues , the furious temper of the times , and the mysterious death of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey . On that last occasion he displayed much dexterity . There was some difficulty in managing the evidence , whether to bring the assassination to the conspiracy , or the conspiracy to the assassination ; but Oates contrived the matter with such ingenuity , that the murder became a proof , and the plot became a proof of the murder , to the universal conviction of the public . As to Oates ’ other qualities , he was , like every renegade , a licentious scoffer at religion , and , in his manners , addicted , it is said , to the most foul and unnatural debaucheries . When we consider his acts and monuments , it is almost impossible to believe , how so base a tool should have ever obtained credit and opportunity to do such mighty mischief .<span corresp="#note325" type="note_anchor">[ 325 ]</span></p>
   <p>As for his family , to which Dryden alludes a little below , “ he would needs , ” says North , “ be descended of some ancient and worshipful stock ; but there were not so many noble families strove for him , as there were cities strove for the parentele of Homer . However , the heralds were sent for , to make out his pedigree , and give him a blazon . They were posed at the first of these , but they made good the blazon for him in a trice , and delivered it authenticamente , and it was engraved on his table and other plate ; for he was rich , set up for a solemn housekeeper , and lived up to his quality . "[ 326 ]</p>
   <p>Dryden compares Oates to the brazen serpent raised up in the wilderness , by looking on which , the Israelites were cured of the bites of the fiery snakes . Sprat had applied the same simile , in a favourable sense , to Oliver Cromwell :</p>

   <p>North has left us some specimens of Oates ’ peculiar mode of pronounciation . Bedloe , his brother-witness in the plot , had been taken ill at Bristol , and , on his death-bed , held some conference with the Lord Chief-Justice North , then upon a circuit , who took down his examination , concerning which numerous reports went forth . It proved , however , to be the same story he had formerly told . Even Dr Oates himself was disappointed ; and was heard to say aloud , as the Lord Chief-Justice passed through the court on a council-day , at all which times he was a diligent attendant , “ Maay Laird Chaife-Jaistaice , whay this baisness of Baidlaw caims to naithaing . ” But his Lordship walked on without attending to his discourse .<span corresp="#note327" type="note_anchor">[ 327 ]</span></p>
   <p>In personal appearance North informs us , that “ he was a low man , of an ill-cut very short neck ; and his visage and features were most particular . His mouth was the centre of his face , and a compass there would sweep his nose , forehead , and chin , within the perimeter . Cave quos Deus ipse notavit . "[ 328 ] An engraving of the doctor , now before me , bears witness to this last peculiarity , and does justice to the cherubic plenitude of countenance and chin mentioned in the text . It is drawn and engraved by Richard White , and bears to be “ the true originall , taken from the life , done for Henry Brome and Richard Chiswel ; all others are counterfeit . ”</p>
   <p>As the doctor 's portrait is not now quite so common as when the lady , mentioned in the Spectator , wore it upon her fan , gloves , and handkerchief , the curious reader may be pleased to be informed , that this “ true original ” is prefixed to “ The Witch of Endor , or the Witchcrafts of the Roman Jezebel , by Titus Oates , D. D. folio 1679 . ” It is dedicated to the Earl of Shaftesbury , &amp; c .; “ the Publisher 's affectionate good friend , and singular good Lord . ”</p>

     <l n="14">And Corah might for Agag 's murder call ,</l>
     <l n="15">In terms as coarse as Samuel used to Saul .— P . 237 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the first book of Samuel , chap . xv ., the reader will find the reproaches with which that prophet loaded Saul , for sparing , contrary to God 's commandment , Agag , king of the Amalekites ; concluding with the awful denunciation , that for his disobedience the Lord had rejected him from being king over Israel .</p>
   <p>Agag 's murder is to be understood of the mysterious death of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey . This gentleman was an active justice of peace , and had been knighted by Charles II ., on account of his exertions during the fire of London . In other respects , he was low-spirited , and rather a timorous man , and , in the exercise of his office , favourable to the Catholics . Oates , finding the information he had lodged with the ministers concerning the Popish plot rather less ardently listened to than he expected , chose to utter before this magistrate a full declaration on the subject upon oath . His intention was probably to make the matter as public as possible . Godfrey expressed much unwillingness to have any thing to do with the matter at all ; and when he had heard the story out , expressed to his friends his fear that he should have no thanks for his pains , but would probably be the first martyr . This strange , and one would think absurd , boding proved too true ; after having been missing for several days , this unfortunate man was found lying in a ditch , near Primrose-hill . There were marks of strangling round his neck ; and although his own sword was thrust through his body , yet it turned out to have been done after death . His money and rings were safe ; robbery was therefore out of the question . This murder ever will remain among the riddles of history . Three opinions have been entertained : 1st , North does not hesitate to affirm , that the contrivers and abettors of the plot murdered this poor man , to give some colour to the story of the bloody machinations of the Papists : But this seems too strange and desperate a course to be imputed to the opposition party at large without some positive proof ; and as for Oates and his brother witnesses , ( whom we will not injure by suspecting them capable of remorseful , or compunctious visitings ,) their steps were , at this time , too much the object of observation to admit of their executing so bloody a plan with the necessary degree of secrecy . 2d , It has been thought that Godfrey , a man of a melancholy temperament , whose dark and cloudy spirit had been just agitated by a strange tale of blood and mystery , may have been wrought up to take that time to commit suicide . It is even positively asserted , that he hanged himself at home , and that his brothers conveyed the body to the place where it was found , to avoid the shame and other consequences of his fate becoming public . There is something plausible in this account ; but it is entirely unsupported by proof of any kind . 3d , The grand solution , and indeed the only one which would go down at the time , was , that Godfrey had fallen by the papists . There were probably enough of fanatics in that sect to have executed such a deed , had it been of consequence to the progress of their religion : But there appears no adequate motive for taking off Godfrey , who had merely taken down a deposition which he could not refuse to receive , and who had besides endeavoured to serve the accused parties , by transmitting to Coleman an account of the affidavit ; while Oates and his companions , the depositaries of the supposed secret , and whose death would stifle the plot for ever , were suffered to walk about , even unattempted . Positive evidence was however obtained , to silence all hypothetical reasoning on the subject . One Bedlow , a very infamous character , amid a thousand dreadful stories of fires raised by the Jesuits from 1666 downwards , charged the Catholics , and particularly Miles Prance , a silver-smith , with the death of Godfrey<span corresp="#note329" type="note_anchor">[ 329 ]</span>. This man was imprisoned in Newgate ; and , after much communing with Shaftesbury and Buckingham , in which , it is said , neither threats , promises , nor actual tortures were spared , confessed himself an accomplice in the murder .<span corresp="#note330" type="note_anchor">[ 330 ]</span>He retracted this confession before the privy-council ; but being remanded to prison , new terrors , promises , and sufferings , induced him to retract that retractation . His story was a tissue of improbabilities ; and he and Bedlow , when adduced as evidence on the trial of three poor men , whom they charged with strangling Godfrey , concealing the body in Somerset-House , and afterwards disposing of it on Primrose-hill , contradicted each other , and contradicted themselves . All was in vain : the three innocent victims of perjury were condemned and executed , and the witnesses promoted and rewarded , not with money only , but , strange to say , with universal respect and regard ; although their merit , supposing it to be real , was that of murderers and incendiaries , who had turned evidence for the crown against their accomplices .</p>
   <p>The outcry raised about Godfrey 's murder at the time , and for long after , gave the plot its surest foundation and support . When his funeral rites were performed , the crowd was prodigious , and the papists were sufficiently cautious to keep within doors , or some might have been offered up as an oblation to the manes of Justice Godfrey . While the clergyman preached the funeral sermon of the protestant victim , two robust divines stood by him in the pulpit , lest , while rendering this last duty to the murdered magistrate , he should in facie ecclesiæ be murdered by the papists . At the formal pope-burnings of the party , Sir Edmondbury , supported on a steed by his murderers , was a principal figure in the procession , preceded by a harbinger , who rung a bell , and admonished the people to remember Justice Godfrey . In short , this unfortunate gentleman 's death , however it came about , continued long to be the watch-word and war-cry of those , who called themselves the true protestant party .</p>

   <p>“ In August , 1680 , the Duke of Monmouth went into the country to divert himself , visiting several gentlemen in the west of England , by whom he was received and entertained with a gallantry suitable to the greatness of his birth , and the relation he stood in to his majesty ; incredible numbers of people flocking from all the adjacent parts to see this great champion of the English nation , who had been so successful against both the Dutch , French , and Scots . He went first into Wiltshire , and was pleased to honour the worthy esquire Thynne with his company for some days . From thence he went to Mr Speak 's , in Somersetshire , in which progress he was caressed with the joyful acclamations of the country people , who came from all parts ; twenty miles about the lanes and hedges being every where lined with men , women , and children , who , with incessant shouts , cried , “ God bless King Charles and the Protestant Duke ! ” In some towns and parishes which he passed through , they strewed the streets and highways where he was to pass with herbs and flowers , especially at Ilchester and Pithyton ; others presenting him with bottles of wine . When he came within ten miles of Mr Speak 's , he was met by two thousand persons on horseback , whose numbers still increased as they drew nearer to Mr Speak 's , and when they arrived there , they were reputed to be twenty thousand ; wherefore they were forced to break down several pearch of his park pales to enlarge their passage to the house , where his grace and all this numerous company were entertained and treated , in an extraordinary manner .</p>
   <p>“ On the 26th , he went to Brompton ; being met on the road by a great company of gentry and country people , who conducted him to Sir J. Sydenham 's , where he was entertained at a noble and splendid dinner . The next day he went to Barrington , where he was pleased to honour Mr William Stroud with his company at dinner ; the entertainment being nothing inferior to what his Grace had met with in all other places . After dinner he went to Chard , where he arrived about five in the afternoon , attended with a train of five thousand horsemen ; and there he was met and welcomed by a crowd of men , women , and children , who had not a mute among them , but were almost all of them made deaf by their own shouts and acclamations of joy . His Grace lay there that night , being treated at a very splendid supper ; he lodged at the house of M. Prideaux .<span corresp="#note331" type="note_anchor">[ 331 ]</span>The next day , having been entertained at a sumptuous dinner , he rid to Ilminster , and in the afternoon he went to Whitelackindon , where he lay that night ; and the day following , which was Sunday , his grace observed the Sabbath with a religious care , and went to Ilminster church . On the 30th , he went to Calliton , where he was entertained by Sir Walter Young . The next day he went to Overton , where he was entertained , and lodged by Mr Dukes . From thence he went to Exeter , and was met by the citizens and the people of all the adjacent parts , to the number of twenty thousand persons ; but that which was more remarkable , was the appearance of a brave company of brisk , stout young men , all clothed in linen waistcoats and drawers , white , and harmless , having not so much as a stick in their hands ; they were in number about nine hundred or a thousand ; they went three miles out of the city to meet his Grace , where they were drawn up all on a little hill , and divided into two parts , in which order they attended the Duke 's coming , who rid up first between them , and then round each company ; after which they united , and went hand in hand in order before , where he was no sooner arrived , but a universal shout from all parts echoed forth his welcome ; the numerous concourse of people , the incredible and amazing acclamations , and the universal joy which then filled the whole city , far exceeding my pen to describe .<span corresp="#note332" type="note_anchor">[ 332 ]</span></p>
   <p>“ From thence he returned to Mr Speake 's , where the whole country flocked again to see and admire him , not being enough satisfied with their former sight . From thence he went the next day to Mr Harvie 's , near Yeovil , where he dined , and in the afternoon he rid to Esquire Thynne 's ; people flocking from all the towns and villages thereabout to Howden-hill , where they attended the Duke 's coming ; and after they had , by loud acclamations , proclaimed his welcome amongst them , and expressed their joy for his safe return , they took their leave of him , returning his Grace their humble and hearty thanks for that kind visit , and for his having condescended to accept of their plain , but true-hearted entertainment . From thence he returned to London , wonderfully pleased with the noble and generous entertainment he met with at the several places where he came ; every place striving to out-vye each other . "[ 333 ]</p>
   <p>At Tunbridge Wells . “ Abundance of country people rudely crowded , after their rustic manner , to see the eldest son of their king and sovereign , every one extolling him to the skies , crying to one another , ‘ O what a brave man he is ! ’ Some admired the beauty and make of his person ; some the majesty and port of his carriage ; and others , who had seen the king , the exact resemblance he bare to his majesty ; affirming , they never , in all their lives , saw a son resemble a father more than the duke did the king ; but all admired his affable and courteous disposition . "[ 334 ]</p>
   <p>These assemblies were chiefly made under pretence of cock-matches , horse-races , and other popular amusements ; pretexts the more dangerous , as they were the well-known signals of rendezvous at which the cavaliers were wont to concert their plots against Cromwell . See the tract called “ Killing no Murder . ” Foot races , wrestling matches , and other country pastimes , were also resorted to as an ostensible cause of meeting . These gave Monmouth an opportunity to display his personal agility and liberality . He wrestled , he ran , and carried off the prize , in both exercises ; he then ran in his boots against the peasants in their shoes , and still obtained the victory . The prizes which he gained were freely distributed among his competitors . All these arts of popularity became the derision of his enemies , when he was forced into exile ; as , for example , in the following verses :</p>
   <lg>

     <l n="5">But now he 's gone into Holland</l>
     <l n="6">To be a king of no land ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or else must be monarch of Poland ;</l>

     <l n="13">Is this your races , horse-matches ,</l>

   <p>These ostentatious progresses were devised by Shaftesbury , as a mode of manifesting the strength of Monmouth 's party , and increasing his partizans and popularity . Among the higher ranks , they carried an air of defiance which rather hurt his cause ; for reflecting and cautious men were slow to join in what seemed to be a preliminary for civil war . It was different with the lower orders , who , always biassed by what is more immediately addressed to their eye-sight , were led by these showy processions , and by the courtesy , activity , and fine presence of Monmouth , to doat on him to an incredible degree . Not only did the western peasantry , on his landing in 1685 , crowd to join him in multitudes beyond what he could arm , but their attachment survived even his defeat and death ; and they long believed , with fond credulity , that another person had been executed in his stead , and that their beloved protestant prince was still alive .</p>
   <p>The arts of Absalom , in stealing the hearts of Israel from his father , form an exact parallel to the language which Dryden puts in the mouth of Monmouth .</p>
   <p>“ And it came to pass after this , that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses , and fifty men to run before him . And Absalom rose up early , and stood beside the way of the gate : and it was so , that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment , then Absalom called unto him , and said , Of what city art thou ? And he said , Thy servant is one of the tribes of Israel . And Absalom said unto him , See , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee . Absalom said moreover , Oh that I were made judge in the land , that every man , which hath any suit or cause , might come unto me , and I would do him justice ! And it was so , that when any man came nigh unto him to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and kissed him . And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel , that came to the king for judgment . So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel . ” 2d Sam . chap . xv . v. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .</p>

   <p>Thomas Thynne , esquire , of Longleat-hall , called , from his great wealth , Tom of Ten Thousand . He had been formerly a friend of the Duke of York , but , upon some quarrel between them , he attached himself warmly to Monmouth . Mr Thynne was one of those gentlemen , who petitioned for the speedy meeting of parliament , after it was prorogued in 1679 , on account of the heat with which the house pursued the Exclusion Bill . The king received the intimation very ill ; told Mr Thynne , he was surprised at persons of property countenancing such proceedings , and that he wished they would mind their own affairs , and leave him to attend to his . When Monmouth made his progress through the west of England , as mentioned in the last note , Mr Thynne received him at his country-seat with all the splendour and liberality of ancient English hospitality . This gentleman 's tragical fate is well known . He was married to the Lady Ogle , sole heiress of the Northumberland estate ; but , his bride going abroad , the marriage was never consummated . Count Konigsmark met the lady , fell in love with her person , or with her fortune , and could see no better road to both than by assassinating her husband . Accordingly , three foreigners , hired by the count , or dependents upon him , waylaid Mr Thynne 's carriage , as it passed through Pall-Mall , and shot him with a blunderbuss , in the manner represented on his tombstone in Westminster Abbey .<span corresp="#note335" type="note_anchor">[ 335 ]</span>The Duke of Monmouth had left the carriage about an hour before the murder ; and sir John Reresby received the thanks of the king for his activity in apprehending the assassins , without which , suspicions might have arisen that the attempt was intended against Monmouth by the court party .<span corresp="#note336" type="note_anchor">[ 336 ]</span>Monmouth himself remained all night with his dying friend , and distinguished himself by his zeal and assiduity in furthering the search after the murderers . At length , Count Konigsmark was taken by Gibbons , one of Monmouth 's attendants , who seized him , as he was going on ship-board . When apprehended , Gibbons charged him with the fact , and added , that he had like to have killed his master , the Duke of Monmouth ; to which the Count answered , “ they would not have killed him . ” The three actual assassins were condemned to death ; but , by some foul play ,<span corresp="#note337" type="note_anchor">[ 337 ]</span>Konigsmark , who had employed them , and who came over to England expressly to see that they executed their bloody commission , was acquitted .

   <p>The accusations against York and the Queen were no part of Oate 's original plot . On the contrary , in the summary of his “ True Narrative , ” he informs us , that the “ Royal family of the Stuarts are condemned to be cut off , root and branch , and namely , the King , Duke of York , and Prince of Orange , because that family have not answered their expectation , nor have they any hopes that any of them will comply fully with this their bloody design , when fully discovered to them . ” And on the next page , it is again affirmed , that notwithstanding the Duke of York 's zeal for the Catholic religion , “ they design to dispose of him as is aforesaid . ” But when the public belief in the plot had taken root , and Shaftesbury had grafted upon it his doctrine of exclusion , Oates , by degrees , charged the Duke , first with being the innocent and blind tool of the Catholics whom they intended to succeed his brother , though he knew nothing of their designs ; and finally , with being at the very depth of all the villainy , and the immediate author of the Fire of London . As for the queen , her barrenness was a reason , for all the exclusionists desiring she should be removed , that the king might have a chance of legitimate issue , to the exclusion of the Duke of York . Animated by a belief , that this would be agreeable to the king , Oates had the boldness , at the bar of the House of Commons , to utter these words , in his affected phraseology , “ Aye , Taitus Oates , accause Catherine , Quean of England , of haigh traison ! ” The grounds of his accusation are stated in the trial of Wakeman , the queen 's physician , who , he alleged , was bribed with 15 , 000l to poison the king , in case he should escape the poniard of a Jesuit , named Coniers , and the pistols of Pickering and Groves . Oates then swore , that three Jesuits carried him with them to Somerset-house , where they were summoned to attend the Queen ; that he remained in an anti-chamber when they were ushered into her presence ; that he heard a female voice say , she would assist Sir George Wakeman in his project , and would no longer bear these repeated violations of her bed . When the fathers came out , he desired to see the queen , and when admitted into the anti-chamber , whence the female voice had proceeded , he saw the queen , who smiled graciously on him , and there was no other woman present . These impudent stories , with some blunders into which the best-breathed witness may fall , saved Wakeman 's life .</p>
   <p>The King immediately saw the tendency of this charge , and observed , “ They think I have a mind for a new wife ; but for all that , I will not see an innocent woman abused ; ” and certainly , had he given way to it , the Queen would have been in great danger .</p>

   <p>James Butler , Duke , Marquis , and Earl of Ormond , Earl of Ossory and Brecknock , &amp; c. &amp; c. was as illustrious for his talents , as for his rank , and distinguished by virtues superior to both . In the difficult and dangerous situation of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland , he had to maintain the cause of Charles I. in that kingdom , with very slender means , at once against the confederated Irish Catholics , and the parliamentary forces , the more formidable , though less numerous , enemies of the royal cause . In 1649 , he was able , through consummate skill , both as a politician and general , to boast that he had reduced almost all Ireland under the royal authority , excepting the cities of Dublin and Londonderry . But Cromwell 's arrival , with 8000 disciplined and veteran forces , effectually changed the scene . His first exploit was the storm of Tredagh , or Drogheda , where the besiegers put the whole garrison to the sword , and committed the most dreadful excesses of barbarity . After this terrible example of severity , hardly any of the royal garrisons could be prevailed on to make such a defence , as might expose them to the same extremity . Wexford , and New Ross , both very strong places , surrendered without a blow ; all the forces under Lord Inchiquin revolted to the side of the parliament ; and , at length , in 1650 , Ormond saw himself under the necessity of abandoning the kingdom , which he had so long and valiantly defended . From Ireland he retreated to France , and accompanied King Charles during his exile . He was much trusted by that prince ; and was charged with the task of withdrawing the Duke of Gloucester from the family of the queen mother , Henrietta , who was making every possible attempt to induce him to change his religion . This delicate commission he executed with dexterity and success . He had afterwards the satisfaction to forward a reconciliation between the king and his mother , who had been on bad terms on account of the queen 's imprudent interference with her son 's religious tenets . At the Restoration , the Marquis of Ormond , for such was then his title , was liberally rewarded , in lands and honours , for his steady attachment to the royal party . He was created Duke of Ormond in Ireland , and appointed steward of the household , groom of the stole , and privy counsellor for the three kingdoms . In 1661 , he was made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland . As the duke was a steady friend of the great Clarendon , his services , and faithful zeal for the king 's real interests , did not prevent his sharing in the disgrace of the chancellor . He had quarrelled with Lady Castlemaine , then the favourite mistress , who gave vent to her rage in the most abusive reproaches , and finally told the duke , she hoped to see him hanged ; to which he made the memorable reply , that , far from wishing her ladyship 's days shortened in return , his greatest desire was to see her grow old . When Clarendon was banished , the prevailing party , and especially the Duke of Buckingham , entertained a design of impeaching the Duke of Ormond , and succeeded so far as to deprive him of the lieutenancy of Ireland . The profligate Buckingham agitated a still darker project , and is supposed to have hired the famous Blood to attempt the assassination of his rival , in which the ruffian had nearly succeeded . When Blood was afterwards taken in his attempt to steal the regalia , the king being desirous to spare his life , sent to Ormond to intimate his wish , that his grace would consent to the proposed pardon . Ormond nobly answered , if his majesty could forgive him the stealing of his crown , he might easily pardon the assault on his life . The gallant Earl of Ossery ,<span corresp="#note338" type="note_anchor">[ 338 ]</span>who guessed whence the attempt originally proceeded , seeing the Duke of Buckingham shortly afterwards in the presence , charged him with being the author of the intended assassination ; and added , “ if his father came to a violent end , he should be at no loss to know the author , should consider Buckingham as the murderer , and pistol him , if he stood behind the king 's chair : this ” he boldly added , “ I tell you in the king 's presence , that you may be sure I shall keep my word . ” It does not appear that this spirited speech met either a retort from Buckingham , or a check from the king . Although the Duke of Ormond escaped the more open , as well as the more secret practices of his enemies , he experienced much coldness from the king , partly on account of his disliking the French intrigues , and partly because he disdained to pay court to the royal mistresses . Yet he would not throw up the staff , which he held as lord-steward of the household , but continued his attendance on court with as much punctuality as if in the highest favour . This mode of conduct greatly embarrassed the good-natured , though unprincipled Charles , to whom Ormond 's silent and unreproachful attentions were the most cutting memento of his own ingratitude . On one occasion , the king appeared so much confused , that the Duke of Buckingham asked him , whether he had lost the Duke of Ormond 's favour , or Ormond had lost his , since , of the two , his majesty seemed most out of countenance ?— In this neglected situation , the duke used good-humouredly to compare himself to an old neglected rusty clock ; “ yet , even that , ” said he , “ points right once in the twelve hours , and so perhaps may I . ” On another occasion , when Colonel Cary Dillon pressed him for his interest with the king , and said , he had no friend at court , save God and his grace ,— “ Alas ! poor Cary , ” said the duke , “ thou couldst not have two friends who have so little influence there , and are so much neglected . ” During all the king 's coldness , the duke never altered his political principles , although Charles carried his estrangement to the pitch of not even speaking to him . His opinion of Shaftesbury , and his party , may be learned from an incident which happened during his disgrace at court . “ The day that the Earl of Shatesbury was declared lord-chancellor , the king broke through his ordinary rule ( of not addressing the duke ) and either in doubt about the wisdom of the step he had taken , or out of curiosity to know the Duke of Ormond 's sentiments of it , went up to him , and , taking him aside to a window , asked what he thought of his giving the seals to Lord Shaftesbury , whether he had done prudently or not ? His grace replied , you have doubtless acted very prudently in so doing , if you know how to get them from him again . ” Carte , Vol . II . p. 462 . At length , after the duke had attended court for a year without receiving a civil word from his sovereign , he suddenly received a message , that the king meant to sup with him . At the entertainment , no word of explanation took place , although the ancient cordiality between the king and his subject seemed to be fully restored . The next day , when the duke came to the court , as usual , the king observed , “ Yonder comes Ormond ; I have done all I can to disoblige him , and render him as discontented as others ; but he will be loyal in spite of my teeth : I must even take him in again , as the fittest man to govern Ireland . ” Accordingly , the duke was restored to his office of lord-lieutenant in 1677 .</p>
   <p>He held this high situation during the ferment occasioned by the Popish plot ; and although , according to Oates and Bedloe 's information , one branch of that conspiracy was the murder of the duke , yet he did not escape suspicion of being accessary to it any more than the king , who was in the same predicament . Lord Shaftesbury , in the parliament of 1679 , insinuated an accusation against the duke , on account of the alleged favour he shewed to Papists . From this charge he was vindicated by the Earl of Ossory , with an uncommon degree of spirited eloquence . Alter pleading his father 's services against the Roman Catholic rebels , the danger of assassination from them which he had repeatedly escaped , and the active share he had in preventing the perversion of the Duke of Gloucester from the Protestant faith , he thus retorted upon Shaftesbury ; “ Having spoke of what he has done , I presume with the same truth to tell your lordship what he has not done . He never advised the breaking the triple league ; he never advised the shutting up of the exchequer ; he never advised the declaration for a toleration ; he never advised the falling out with the Dutch , and the joining with France ; he was not the author of that most excellent position , Delenda est Carthago ; that Holland , a Protestant country , should , contrary to the true interest of England , be totally destroyed . I beg your lordship will be so just , as to judge of my father , and of all men , according to their actions and counsels . "[ 339 ] Shaftesbury , abashed at this summary of his former political conduct , so different from that he was now pursuing , retracted his accusation with some symptoms of confusion . It remained , however , a capital object with the Whigs , to remove , if possible , the Duke of Ormond from the management of Ireland , at least to put in such a council as should trammel his measures . The King 's firmness disconcerted both these plans . At the momentous period when Shaftesbury was committed to the Tower , the Duke of Ormond was sent for to England , that his presence might add respectability and weight to the king 's councils . He entered the city with great pomp ; and was every where received with the veneration due to his rank , his age , and his services . He had never linked himself to any political faction ; contented to serve the crown upon the old cavalier principles , which he always asserted . He was thought , however , to go too great lengths in advising the king to maintain his authority by harsh measures ; nor were his experience and authority sufficient to prevent much confused jarring in the king 's councils , betwixt Halifax , who was for holding the scales even between the factions , and the high-flying Tories , who were posting towards arbitrary power . Yet , as a steady supporter of the interests of the crown , particularly in the course of the city elections , he deserved the honour which Dryden has assigned him , of standing the first in the file of the king 's friends .</p>
   <p>The King was pleased to reward the services of Ormond by giving him the rank of an English Duke , in 1682 . After having been so long threatened with removal , as a favourer of the Papists , he was actually deprived of the lieutenancy of Ireland , in 1684 , for not being disposed to second James II . in the countenance which he meant to afford that sect . The great Duke of Ormond , to which epithet he has a just title , died on the 21 July , 1688 , without witnessing the second banishment of the house of Stewart .</p>
   <p>This great statesman was a particular patron of Dryden , as is evident from the dedication of “ Plutarch 's Lives ; ” where our author again expresses his respect for the father , and his regret for the son . After the death of both , our poet continued to enjoy the countenance of their successor , James , second Duke of Ormond , son of the gallant Ossory , to whom he has dedicated the Fables .</p>

   <p>The Duke of Ormond had eight sons , and two daughters . Six of those sons were dead in 1681 , when this poem was published . He , over whom Dryden pours forth this lamentation , was the gallant Thomas , Earl of Ossory , whom , in the last note , we have exhibited as the guardian of his father 's life and reputation . At the age of twenty-one , his external appearance and accomplishments are thus described by one who knew him well :[ 340 ] “ He is a young man , with a very handsome face , a good head of hair , a pretty big voice , well set , and a good round leg . He pleaseth me exceedingly ; being very good-natured , asking many questions , and humouring the answers . He rides the great horse very well , is a good tennis player , fencer , and dancer . He understands music , and plays on the guittar and lute ; speaks French eloquently , reads Italian fluently ; is a good historian , and so well versed in romances , that , if a gallery be full of pictures , or hangings , he will tell the story of all that are there described . He shuts up his door at eight o'clock in the evening , and studies till midnight . He is temperate , courteous , and excellent in all his behaviour . ” When the Duke of Ormond went into exile , his son was imprisoned by Cromwell , but , being afterwards released , he went abroad . In 1659 , he married the daughter of Beverwaert , governor of Sluys , a leading man in the States-General . Upon the Restoration , he was promoted in the army , which did not prevent his exerting his gallantry on another element ; for , during the desperate action of four days in 1666 , upon hearing the sound of the cannon , he contrived to get off from Harwich , and to get on board the Duke of Albemarle , to whom he brought the first news , that Prince Rupert was recalled to support him . He distinguished himself by his bravery during the battle in Southwold Bay , and by his liberality to the wounded seamen after the action . In 1673 he was made rear-admiral of the blue squadron ; and , in the great battle in which Sir Edward Spragge was killed , he lay by to defend and bring off that admiral 's disabled vessel . He is said to have formed a plan for revenging the surprise at Chatham , by a descent at Helvoetsluys ; when he averred he would burn the Royal Charles , which the Dutch preserved as a trophy , and the whole Dutch fleet , with a half-penny candle , or consent , in case of failure , that his head should be placed beside Cromwell 's on Westminster-Hall . But the scheme was not attempted ; being prevented , it is said , by the envious interposition of Buckingham . In November 1674 , the Earl of Ossory had the honour to be intrusted with the charge of arranging the match between the Prince of Orange and the Lady Mary . He served under the prince against the French with great credit , particularly in the famous battle of Mons , fought 1678 , where , with the British regiments under his command , he executed with glory the desperate service of beating the French out of their entrenchments . In April 1680 , he was designed Governor of Tangiers , an appointment with which he was highly pleased ; for his courage , being of a romantic and wild nature , delighted in the prospect of being opposed to such uncommon adversaries as the Moors . But , while he was busily preparing for his departure , he was seized with a malignant fever , during the delirium of which his mind was observed constantly to be occupied with his intended exploits against the besiegers of Tangiers .<span corresp="#note341" type="note_anchor">[ 341 ]</span>He died on the 30th July , 1680 , aged forty-six years . The lamentation for his loss was general and excessive ; the noble reply of his venerable father , to those who offered him consolation , is well known : “ Since he had borne the death of his king , he could support , ” he said , “ that of his child ; and would rather have his dead son , than any living son in Christendom . ”</p>
   <p>The Earl of Ossory was a patron of learning ; and was mourned , both in verse and prose , by many other writers , as well as Dryden . Settle , who then seems to have been in the Tory interest , published a heroic poem on his death . Flatman wrote a pindaric ode on the same occasion ; for which he received , from the Duke of Ormond , a diamond ring of 100 guineas value .— See WOOD 'S Athenæ Oxon . There is another ode written by K. C ., perhaps Katherine Cockburn ; finally , one bard , resolving to amuse the nation 's mourning by his own , dedicates to Ossory 's memory some exquisite stanzas , beginning thus : “ Upon the Earl of Ossory , who died of a fever , 30th July , 1680 . ”</p>

   <p>Sancroft , Archbishop of Canterbury , was , in principle and practice , a rigid high-church man . He even harboured notions favourable to the celibacy of the clergy , and other ascetic doctrines of the church of Rome . Burnet says , “ that he was a man of solemn deportment , sullen gravity , and some learning . ” He made profession of the old cavalier faith and principles of loyalty , which rendered him acceptable to the court and the high-church party in general , although his temper was austere and reserved , and his manners dry and distant . Yet the Archbishop , though so harshly described by his brother of Sarum , displayed , on one urgent occasion , a becoming readiness to assert the doctrine of the church of England against those of Rome ; and on another , the steadiness of his own political principles , although his adherence , in both instances , exposed him to persecution from those in power . While the head of the high-church party , this primate was the first to encourage the bishops and clergy to a refusal to read the king 's declaration of indulgence ; he concerted also , and signed the memorable petition , for which , with six other prelates , he suffered imprisonment and trial , by one of the most imprudent exertions of power which an infatuated monarch ever attempted . On the 16th of July , 1688 , this primate recommended a set of articles to the bishops within his metropolitan jurisdiction , inculcating residence and attention to parochial duties ; but especially , that the clergy should take heed of Romish emissaries , who , like the old serpent , insidiantur calcaneo , and besiege the beds of dying persons , to unsettle their faith . He also recommends a tender regard to their “ brethren , the protestant dissenters , ” and an union with them against the church of Rome . At the Revolution , the Archbishop was one of those privy counsellors who invited the Prince of Orange to take charge of the government ; but as his principles did not permit him to accede to any step for removing King James from the throne , he declined sitting in the Convention of the estates . In conformity to the same principles , he refused to take the oaths of allegiance to the Revolution government ; and was , in consequence , first suspended , and finally deprived of his dignity , in which he was succeeded by the famous Tillotson . He was regarded by the high-church party as a confessor , if not a martyr , for the doctrine of passive obedience . Sancroft died in 1693 .</p>

   <p>Compton , Bishop of London , was youngest son of the late , and brother to the then Earl of Northampton . He had been a soldier until he was thirty and upwards , when he exchanged the sword for the gown . He is said by Burnet to have been a great hater of Popery , and exact in performing the duties of his diocese ; but unlearned , weak , and wilful . He was a high-church man , and held some reputation in the party , from his personal rank , and the dignity of his situation . In other respects , the bishop seems to have been good-tempered and hospitable , but much at the devotion of the Earl of Danby , who had early assisted him with his patronage . Although the Duke of York hated Compton , yet the charge of the education of the Princesses Mary and Anne devolved upon him . In the reign of James II ., he distinguished himself in the House of Peers , by a severe rebuff to the insolence of Jefferies , the Chancellor . Soon after , the Bishop was cited before the illegal court , called the Ecclesiastical Commission , to answer for having refused to obey the king 's command , by suspending Sharpe , a clergyman , who had preached a sermon against Popery . He requested a copy of their commission ; but Jefferies , with his usual violence , told him , he might have it for a penny in any coffeehouse , and he might believe , in the mean while , that they were not such fools as to sit there without an effectual one . After some delay , he was suspended from his function , until the news of the Prince of Orange 's intended expedition , when his suspension was removed . The credit which the bishop acquired by this persecution , amounted to what Mulgrave called a “ reverential popularity , which , ” his lordship adds , “ he of all the bishops would have found it most difficult to have acquired otherwise . ” This led to the Bishop of London playing what , considering his age and situation , was rather a remarkable part in the Revolution ; when Prince George of Denmark went over to the Prince of Orange , and the princess , his wife , afterwards Queen Anne , either fearing the resentment of her father , or determined by the councils of Lady Churchill , ( afterwards the famous Duchess of Marlborough ,) resolved to leave Whitehall , and abandon her father 's party . The Bishop acted as her escort on this occasion ; and , the time and circumstances reviving his military habits , he rode before her coach to Northampton , with pistols at his saddle , and a drawn sword in his hand . It may easily be believed , that Dryden did not greatly approve of this last exploit of his hospitable and noble Sagan ; and he has left a pretty strong testimony of his latter opinion , if the verses called “ Suum Cuique ” are really written by him :</p>

He was , according to Burnet , an excellent preacher , but a man of more spirit than discretion , and imprudent in his behaviour .

   <p>Adriel is the Earl of Mulgrave , afterwards Marquis of Normanby and Duke of Buckingham . He was one of Dryden 's most early and effectual patrons . The “ Essay upon Satire ” was their joint composition , and Dryden inscribed to him his play of “ Aureng-Zebe . ” The praise bestowed by Dryden is , as usual , discriminating and appropriate . Mulgrave exhibits his “ sharp judgement ” in his “ Essay on Poetry , ” which contains some good critical remarks ; but of his lordship 's poetical talents we have spoken sufficiently elsewhere .<span corresp="#note342" type="note_anchor">[ 342 ]</span>His political principles were those of a staunch Tory , which he maintained through his whole life ; and was zealous for the royal prerogative , although he had no small reason to complain of Charles II ., who , to avenge himself of Mulgrave , for a supposed attachment to the Princess Anne , sent him to Tangiers , at the head of some troops , in a leaky vessel , which it was supposed must have perished in the voyage . Though Mulgrave was apprized of the danger , he scorned to shun it ; and the Earl of Plymouth , a favourite son of the king , generously insisted upon sharing it along with him . This ungenerous attempt to destroy him , in the very act of performing his duty , with the refusal of a regiment , made a temporary change in Mulgrave 's conduct . He connected himself for a time with the country party ;<span corresp="#note343" type="note_anchor">[ 343 ]</span>but he soon returned to his original principles , and continued steadily to support the court during the progress of the Exclusion Bill , and in all the stormy debates of the troubled period to which Dryden 's poem refers . Yet he evinced , that he was not a “ slave of state ; ” for , although James II . made him Lord High Chamberlain , he withstood all the measures which that ill-advised prince adopted in behalf of the Catholic religion . He silenced a priest , who was labouring for his conversion , and had begun with the doctrine of transubstantiation , by the famous repartee , that “ though he believed God made man , he could not believe that man was quits by making God in return . ” But he stood gallantly by King James to the very last , and had the courage to insist upon the council taking measures for the safety of that unfortunate monarch 's person , when , after his first flight , he was seized by the sailors at Feversham .</p>
   <p>Dryden says , Adriel was adorned with the “ honours torn from his disobedient son ; ” because , when Monmouth was deprived of the government of Hull and lieutenancy of Yorkshire , the king conferred them upon the Earl of Mulgrave .</p>

   <p>Sir George Saville , Viscount , Earl , and at length Marquis of Halifax , was the prime minister of Charles during the last years of his reign . He was a man of fine genius and lively imagination ; but , as a politician , was guided rather by a desire to display the full extent of artful and nice management of parties , than by any steady or consistent principle of his own . He was at the head of the small party called Trimmers , who affected a sort of neutrality between the Whig and Tory factions , and were , of course , suspected and hated by both . He originally made a figure in opposition to the court , particularly upon the great debates concerning the test , which he keenly opposed . He voted at first for the bill of Exclusion ; and used the jocular argument against hereditary government , that no man would chuse a man to drive his carriage , merely because his father had been a good coachman . But when that great question came finally to be debated in the House of Lords , on the 15th November , 1680 , Halifax had changed his opinion ; and he even conducted the opposition to the bill , and displayed an extent of capacity and eloquence , equally astonishing to friends and foes , and which , perhaps , never was surpassed in that assembly . Even Shaftesbury sank before this versatile orator ; and there seems little doubt , that his eloquence had a great effect in deciding the issue of that day 's famous debate , by which the Exclusion Bill was thrown out for ever . The House of Commons was so much incensed against Halifax , that they voted an address for his removal from the king 's councils . The king , however , found his own advantage in the fine and balancing policy of Halifax ; and , far from consenting to his disgrace , promoted him to the rank of Marquis , and office of Privy Seal , which was hardly more displeasing to the Whigs than to the Duke of York . To the over-bearing measures of this prince , Halifax was secretly a determined opponent ; it was his uniform object to detach Monmouth so far from the violent councils and party of Shaftesbury , that the interest which he still retained in the king 's affections might be employed as a counterbalance to that of his brother . He prevailed upon the king to see Monmouth , after the discovery of the Rye-house Plot ; and , had the duke then proved more practicable , it is possible , that , backed with the interest of Halifax , he might have regained his place in the king 's favour . Upon this occasion , the Duke of York was not consulted , and made open show of his displeasure . Indeed Halifax told Sir John Reresby , that the Duke would never forgive him .<span corresp="#note344" type="note_anchor">[ 344 ]</span>It is even said , that , immediately before the death of Charles , there was a scheme in agitation , under the management of Halifax , for recalling Monmouth , sending York to Scotland , calling a parliament , and totally changing the violent measures of the last two years .<span corresp="#note345" type="note_anchor">[ 345 ]</span>If so , it was prevented by the king 's sudden death , and left Halifax exposed to the resentment of his successor . For some time , James , in consideration of his great services during the dependence of the Bill of Exclusion , treated him with seeming confidence ; but finding him unwilling to go the lengths he proposed in religious matters , and particularly in the proposed repeal of the test acts , he was totally disgraced . Alter this period , the Marquis of Halifax engaged with those lords who invited over the Prince of Orange ; and joined so cordially in the Revolution , that he was made Keeper of the Seals by King William . He died in April 1695 .</p>
   <p>Amidst the various political changes of this thorough-paced statesman , it ought not to be forgotten , that , though he sided with the court during the last years of King Charles , his councils were a salutary check on the arbitrary measures urged by the Duke of York ; and that he probably merited the praise , which Dryden elsewhere bestows on him , “ of preventing a civil war , and extinguishing a growing fire , which was just ready to have broken forth .

   <p>Laurence Hyde , second son to the great Earl of Clarendon , created Earl of Rochester by Charles II . Even after his father 's fall , he contrived to retain the confidence of Charles , and in 1676 was employed on an embassy to Poland . He was also one of the plenipotentiaries at the treaty of Nimeguen , and for some time ambassador in Holland ; to which diplomatic situations Dryden alludes in the text . He was named one of the commissioners of the treasury in 1679 , and had very considerable influence , by which the poet reaped some advantage ; for , notwithstanding the exhausted state of the exchequer , he acknowledges , that , contrary to the famous comparison of Cowley , Gideon 's fleece had been moistened , when all the ground around was parched . Rochester was a steady opposer of the Bill of Exclusion , for which , in 1681 , he was voted a public enemy by the House of Commons . Indeed , that measure must have materially affected the interests of the Duke of York 's daughters , to whom Rochester stood in the relation of maternal uncle . For the same reason , as well as from political principle , he as keenly withstood the Duke of Monmouth s pretensions ; for which he is stigmatised by Settle , in lines of which the following is a specimen :</p>

   <p>Notwithstanding the compliments bestowed by Dryden on Rochester for his management of the exchequer , he was , when in the high situation of Lord Treasurer , 1682 , accused of peculation by his rival Halifax , who so far prevailed , that Rochester was removed to the more honourable but less important office , of President of the Council ; on which occasion his witty adversary first applied the since well-known phrase , of “ his lordship 's being kicked up stairs . ” After the accession of King James , Rochester was again made Lord Treasurer , but soon lost the staff for his repugnance to enter into the violent measures of that monarch . He had consented to be present at a conference between some Catholic and Protestant divines , but treated the arguments of the former with a contempt which James could not forgive . At the Revolution he observed a sullen neutrality ; and , though uncle to Queen Mary , never heartily acquiesced in her title to the crown , or reaped any benefit from its being occupied by so near a relation . King William never could forgive his once having passed through the Low Countries without waiting upon him .</p>
   <p>He was a particular patron of Dryden , who inscribed to him the “ Duke of Guise ” and “ Cleomenes , ” with expressions of great gratitude and respect . See Vol . VII . p. 13 . Vol . VIII . p. 191 .</p>

   <p>Edward Seymour , afterward Sir Edward Seymour , Bart ., was descended of the elder branch of the illustrious family of that name , and was ancestor of the present Duke of Somerset . He is said to have attached great importance to his high birth , and to have been esteemed the proudest commoner in England . He was speaker of the House of Commons under the Earl of Danby 's administration ; a post which he filled with a mixture of dexterity and dignity . Burnet says , he knew the House and every man of it so well , that at one glance he could tell the fate of every motion . This he used as a means of serving the court ; contriving usually to protract the debate when their party were not assembled in strength . It was alleged by his enemies , that he was the channel through which gratuities were distributed to the court members ; which charge is grossly urged in Settle 's poem called “ Absalom Senior . "[ 347 ] These charges seem to be exaggerated ; at least it is certain , that Seymour 's conduct as speaker was not uniformly , or servilely , guided by devotion to the court ; and that he was acceptable to the Commons , for the Parliament , in 1679 , chose him speaker anew , in opposition to Mr Meres , who was proposed by the court party . But when Seymour was next day presented as speaker to the king , he refused to receive him as such , and said , he had indispensable occasion for his services in another capacity . At this time the crown claimed a voice in the nomination of the speaker , and the dispute became very warm , till it was terminated by the king conceding , that the right of election was in the House , upon their passing from the election of Mr Seymour , and chusing Mr Sergeant Gregory . He was afterwards made Treasurer of the Navy , and was in that office in 1680 , when an impeachment was moved against him for corruption and mal-administration . But the House of Lords repelled the impeachment ; which seems only to have been founded in party clamour . In the following year he was voted a public enemy , for opposing the Bill of Exclusion . In the slavish parliament of 1685 , Seymour had the boldness to deliver a speech on the irregularity of the elections , which had been much biassed by the crown . He told the House , that many doubted whether they were the true representatives of the people ; and that little justice was expected on petitions , where too many were guilty to judge justly and impartially . He said , it concerned the House to look to this ; for , if the nation saw no equity was to be expected from them , they might take means to make the members suffer that justice which they would not grant . No one among the astonished members had been aware of Seymour 's intentions , so none were prepared either to second or answer this bold harangue . This statesman was a friend to the Revolution ; he joined the Prince of Orange at Exeter , and was the first to propose that an association should be signed , without which , he observed , the insurgents were as a rope of sand . On this occasion , the Prince , meaning a compliment , asked Seymour if he was not of the Duke of Somerset 's family ? “ No , please your royal highness , ” was the reply ; “ the Duke is of mine . ” This gave the Prince the first idea of the conscious dignity of an English commoner . William placed Devonshire under his government . In the parliament of 1700-1 , Sir Edward Seymour was active in detecting the corrupt practices of elections , and received the thanks of the House for having protected its constitution .</p>

   <p>Spence , on the authority of a priest whom he often met at Mr Pope 's , has stated , that the king obliged Dryden to put his speech to the Oxford Parliament into verse , and insert it at the close of “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” Mr Malone has extracted the following parallel passages , which give some countenance to the tradition ; although Dryden is just as likely to have versified them of his own accord as by the royal command ; for this speech was the talisman by which he was to extricate David from all his difficulties .<span corresp="#note348" type="note_anchor">[ 348 ]</span></p>
   <p>“ The unwarrantable proceedings of the last House of Commons were the occasion of my parting with the last parliament ; for I , who will never use arbitrary government myself , am resolved not to suffer it in others . —— I am unwilling to mention particulars , because I am desirous to forget faults ; but whoever shall calmly consider what offers I have formerly made , and what assurances I made to the last Parliament ,—— and then shall reflect upon the strange unsuitable returns made to such propositions by men who were called together to consult , perhaps may wonder more that I had patience so long , than that at last I grew weary of their proceedings . —— I conclude with this one advice to you , that the rules and measures of all your votes may be the known and established laws of the land , which neither can nor ought to be departed from , nor changed , but by act of Parliament ; and I may the more reasonably require , that you make the laws of the land your rule , because I am resolved they shall be mine . ”</p>

   <p>The offenders question my forgiving right .— P . 245 .</p>
   <p>In the case of the Earl of Danby , the King 's power of granting him a pardon was warmly disputed ; it being supposed , that the crown had no power to remit the penalty of high treason . So far was this notion stretched , that , as we have already seen , the sheriffs , Bethel and Cornish , contested , in the case of Lord Stafford , the king 's right to exchange the statutory punishment of hanging , drawing , and quartering , for that of beheading . They applied by petition to the House of Commons to have their scruples removed , and , proh pudor ! received the countenance of Lord Russell in this brutal scruple . The king did not forget this circumstance when the writ was issued for Russell 's execution : “ He shall find , ” said Charles , in appointing the commutation of punishment , “ that I have the privilege which he was pleased to deny in the case of Lord Stafford . ”</p>
   <p>The petitioners , mentioned immediately afterwards , are those who called upon the king by petition to summon the parliament . These applications were highly displeasing to Charles , whose followers , to balance them , made equally violent addresses , expressing their abhorrence of tumultuary petitions . Almost every county and town was thus divided into petitioners , and addressers , or abhorrers , as they were sometimes called . The former experienced , on occasion of presenting their petitions , the royal frowns ; while the latter were in a very summary manner committed , by the House of Commons , to the custody of their serjeant . This arbitrary course was ended by the refusal of one Stowel to submit to the arrest , which contempt the House were fain to pass over , by voting that he was indisposed .</p>

   <p>This is rather an imprudent avowal of what was actually the policy of the court faction at this time . They contrived to turn against Shaftesbury and his party , many of those very witnesses by whom so many Catholics had been brought to execution . Dugdale , Turberville , Haynes , and Smith , all of whom had been witnesses of the plot , now came as readily forward to convict Colledge , Howard , and Shaftesbury himself , of high treason . Such infamous traffic ought to have deprived them of credit on all sides ; but it was the misfortune of the time , that , swear what they would one day , and the exact contrary the next , they , on each occasion , found a party to countenance , believe , and reward them .</p>

   <p>ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL .</p>
    <p>PART SECOND .</p>
   <p>The sensation produced in London , and indeed throughout the nation , by the first part of “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” was so deep and extended , as never had been before occasioned by a similar performance . Neither was Dryden backward in pursuing the literary victory which he had obtained over the Whigs . He published “ The Medal ” upon the acquittal of the Earl of Shaftesbury , and the rejoicings with which his party had celebrated that memorable event . He even stooped to inferior game , and avenged himself of Shadwell 's repeated attacks upon his literary reputation , his political principles , and his moral character , by the publication of “ Mac Flecnoe , ” one of the most severe satires in the English language . Yet , according to the opinion of the royal party , more still remained to be done . The heads of Shaftesbury 's faction had been held up to hatred , or ridicule , in “ Absalom and Achitophel ; ” his own life had been more closely scrutinized , and his failings and crimes exposed more specifically in “ The Medal ; ” but something , they conceived , was wanting , to silence and crush the underling writers and agitators of the party , and Dryden 's assistance was again invoked for this purpose , as well as to celebrate some of the king 's supporters and favourites , who were necessarily omitted in the original poem . But Dryden , being unwilling again to undertake a task upon which he had repeatedly laboured , deputed Nahum Tate to be his assistant in a second part of “ Absalom and Achitophel ; ” reserving for himself only the execution of certain particular characters , and the general plan and revisal of the poem .</p>
   <p>Of Tate , honoured with so high a trust by our great poet , biographers have preserved but a very imperfect memorial . He was the son of Dr Faithful Tate or Teat , was born in Ireland , and educated at Trinity College , Dublin . He wrote , or rather new modelled and translated , nine plays , of which , his alteration of King Lear still keeps the stage , in defiance of its gross departure from Shakespeare 's plot and moral . During the reign of Charles and his successor , Tate was a keen Tory , as may be easily guessed from Dryden 's employing him in the honourable task of writing a second part to his admirable satire ; yet , upon Shadwell 's death , he was made poet laureat to King William , and retained that office till his own decease . His talent for poetry amounted to cold mediocrity ; had he been a man of fortune , it would have raised him to the rank of an easy sonnet writer , or a person of wit and honour about town . As he was very poor , it is no disgrace to his muse , that she left him in that indigence from which far more distinguished poetical merit has been unable to raise those who possessed it . Tate died in the Mint , where he had taken refuge from his creditors , on the 12th of August , 1715 . He had long been in extreme want , having owed almost his sole subsistence to the patronage or charity of the Earl of Dorset . His poetry is multifarious ; but consists chiefly of pieces upon occasional subjects , written to supply the immediate wants of the author . The Psalms , of which he executed a translation , in conjunction with Dr Brady , are still used in the church of England , although , in the opinion of many persons , they are inferior to the old version .<span corresp="#note349" type="note_anchor">[ 349 ]</span></p>
   <p>The following continuation of “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” owes all its spirit to the touches and additions of the author of the first part . Those lines , to the number of two hundred , beginning ,</p>
   <p>Next these a troop of busy spirits press ;</p>
   <p>and concluding ,</p>
   <p>To talk like Doeg , and to write like thee ,</p>
   <p>are entirely composed by Dryden , and contain some of the most masterly strokes of his pen . The portraits of Doeg and Og , under which names he stigmatized his personal antagonists , Settle and Shadwell , are executed with a strength of satirical colouring , unmatched in the English language . When we consider that Dryden had already , and very lately , made Shadwell the subject of an entire independent satire , it seems wonderful , with what ease he has executed a separate , and even more striking , caricature of his adversary , without repeating an idea or expression which he had used in “ Mac Flecnoe . ” This is , indeed , partly owing to the dexterous division of his subject , as well as to the rich fertility of his vein of satire . For , after apparently exhausting upon his enemy all the opprobrium and contempt with which a literary character could be loaded , he seized this second occasion to brand and blacken his political and moral principles , and to exaggerate his former charge of dulness , by combining it with those of sedition , profaneness , and immorality . The characters of Ben Jochanan , Judas , Phaleg , &amp; c. are all drawn with the same spirit and vivacity ; and , on the whole , these lines are equal to any of the kind which our author ever wrote .</p>
   <p>Had Dryden limited his assistance to furnishing this fragment , he would rather have injured than served his coadjutor , since it would have shone like a lamp in a dungeon , only to show the dreary waste in which it was inclosed . To prevent Tate from suffering too much by comparison , Dryden has obviously contributed much to the poem at large . Still , though Tate 's lines have doubtless been weeded of much that would at once have ascertained their origin , our author 's own couplet might have been addressed to Nahum on the assistance lent him . Dryden 's spirit is</p>
   <p>—— —— so transfused , as oil and waters flow ; His always floats above , thine sinks below .</p>
   <p>Much of the character of Corah , for example , is unquestionably Dryden 's ; so probably is that of Arod , and the verses generally descriptive of the Green-ribbon Club , which precede it . Such pungent satire is easily distinguished from the smooth insipid flow of other parts in which Dryden 's corrections probably left nothing for censure , and which fate was unable to qualify with any thing entitled to praise . The character of Michal , of Dryden as Asaph , and some of the encomiastic passages , seem to show the extent of Tate 's powers , when unsupported by the vivifying assistance of his powerful auxiliary . They are just decently versified , but flat , common-place , and uninteresting .</p>
   <p>The second part of “ Absalom and Achitophel ” shared the fate of most continuations , and did not attain the popularity of the original . This was not entirely owing to the general inferiority of the poetry ; for there was enough of personal satire , and that immediately flowing from the keen pen of Dryden , to secure the attention both of friends and foes ; but the parallel between the heroes of Scripture and the characters of the day , however striking at first , did not bear to be too long protracted . When the original comparison was made , its aptness at once pleased the imagination , and arrested the attention ; but when prolonged in a second part , readers began to see there was little wit in continuing to draw out the allusion , till it consisted in nothing more than the invention of a Jewish name for a British author or statesman ; the attempt at finding prototypes in Scripture for every modern character being necessarily abandoned . Besides , those who took it upon them to answer Dryden , had in general made use of the vehicle of satire which he had invented ; and as , in the eyes of the public , the theme became stale and tarnished by repetition , his antagonists did him that injury by their stupidity , which their wit was unequal to accomplish . Add to all this , that whole lines , and even longer passages , not to mention images and sentiments , are by Tate , in his poverty of ideas , transferred from the first part of the satire to the second ;<span corresp="#note350" type="note_anchor">[ 350 ]</span>and we must allow , that the latter is deficient in the captivating grace of novelty .</p>
   <p>The second part of “ Absalom and Achitophel ” appeared about November 10th , 1682 , in folio . Tonson is the publisher .</p>

    <head>FOOTNOTES :</head>
    <note xml:id="note349" place="bottom" n="349">The ridicule attached to the translation by Sternhold and Hopkins is proverbial ; yet there is at least little pretension in that despised version , and it gives us , in a homely old-fashioned metre and diction , the sense of the Hebrew authors . But , in Tate and Brady , there is a vain attempt to grace the inspired songs with the incongruous ornaments of modern taste . On the whole , it is perhaps impossible to transfuse the beauties of oriental poetry into a metrical translation . It is remarkable , that , in this very poem , Dryden uses these translations to express nearly the lowest of all poetry . He calls the Whig poets ,</note>

     <l n="2">Who rhyme below even David 's psalms translated .</l>

      <l n="1088">Instead of faithless shelves , a listed field ;</l>

      <l n="1091">Each life had on his slaughtered heap retired ,</l>

    <p n="4">Note I .</p>
    <p n="5">That arts of foreign sway he did affect , And guilty Jebusites from law protect , Whose very chiefs , convict , were never freed ; Nay , we have seen their sacrificers bleed .— P . 320 .</p>
    <p n="6">It is certain , that , whatever the private wishes of Charles may have been , he neither did nor durst interfere , by his royal prerogative , to prevent the execution of Stafford , Coleman , Langhorne , Plunket , and other Catholics of rank , who were condemned on account of the Popish Plot . Ireland , Fenwic , Gavan , Turner , and Harcourt , Jesuits , with Whitebread , the provincial of the order , were all tried , sentenced , and executed for the same conspiracy ; persisting , to their last breath , in the most solemn and deliberate asseverations of innocence : But their dying testimonies only irritated the populace the more against a religion , which taught its votaries to go down to the grave with a manifest lie , as they supposed , in their right hand .</p>
    <p n="7">Note II .</p>
    <p n="8">Mere truth was dull , nor suited with the port Of pampered Corah , when advanced to court .</p>
    <p n="9">Meanwhile a guard on modest Corah wait , If not for safety , needful yet for state .— P . 320 .</p>
    <p n="10">The Parliament , before whom Oates was examined , did not confine themselves to simple approbation of his conduct . He was treated in a manner suitable to the sense they had of his merit and importance . The charge of his personal safety was recommended by the House of Commons to the Lord General , the care of his lodgings and accommodation to the Lord Chamberlain , and that of supplying him with money to the Lord High Treasurer of England .</p>
    <p n="11">The state of Oates , in his splendour , is very well described by North : “ He was now in his trine exaltation ; his plot in full force , efficacy , and virtue ; he walked about with his guards , assigned for fear of the Papists ’ murdering him . He had lodgings at Whitehall , and L. 1200 per annum pension ; and no wonder , after he had the impudence to say to the House of Lords , in plain terms , that , if they would not help him to more money , he must be forced to help himself . He put on an episcopal garb , ( except the lawn sleeves ,) silk gown and cassock , great hat , sattin hatband and rose , long scarf , and was called , or blasphemously called himself , the Saviour of the Nation . Whoever he pointed at was taken up and committed ; so that many people got out of his way as from a blast , and glad they could prove their last two years conversation . The very breath of him was pestilential ; and if it brought not imprisonment or death over such on whom it fell , it surely poisoned reputation , and left good Protestants arrant Papists , and something worse than that , in danger of being put into the plot as traitors . ” Examen . p. 205 .</p>
    <p n="12">Note III .</p>
    <p n="13">To have told his knowledge of the intrigue in gross , Had been , alas ! to our deponent 's loss .— P . 322 .</p>
    <p n="14">Oates never would say he had told all he knew , but always reserved some part of his evidence to be changed or altered with the shifting wind of faction or popularity . According to his first narrative , the plot was laid against the persons of the king and Duke of York ; and their assassination was to take place during the fire of London . But he had the impudence to say , in his picture of King James , that both his brother and he were in that very plot for firing the city , a secret which , he alleges , he could not discover at the time , on account of a promise to Prince Rupert ; and is pleased to add , that the prince heartily repented of giving , and he of taking , that counsel . When he was asked , in the House of Commons , whether he had told all he knew of the conspiracy ? this cautious witness , who was determined to have the whole credit of saving the kingdom his own way , instead of entrusting the House with the secret , told them a parable of a fox , who , having occasion to cross a frozen stream with a goose , and being unwilling to hazard his spoil , first carried over a stone of equal weight with the goose , to see if the ice would bear it . In short , neither he , nor any of his imitators , would say more , than that their immediate evidence was all which they as yet thought meet to declare .</p>
    <p n="15">This would have been tolerated no where but in England , and during that period of terror , suspicion , and infatuation , when these perjured caitiffs were as dear to the people as those who tell stories of Rawhead and Bloody-bones are to their nursery audience . The author has said , and with much truth ,</p>
    <p n="16">‘ Twas worse than plotting to suspect his plot .</p>
    <p n="17">The discovery of Coleman 's letters , however irreconcileable with the tale of the witnesses , above all , the murder of Godfrey , gave such a bloody confirmation , that the people swallowed all that could be told them about the horrors of the conspiracy ; and , to use the warm expression of the author of the “ Examen , ” one might have denied his Redeemer with less contest than attainted the veracity of Oates .</p>
    <p n="18">This popular ferment began to abate after the execution of Lord Stafford ; and , as the witnesses sunk in reputation , the king began by degrees to discountenance Oates . He expelled him from Whitehall , withdrew his guards , and reduced his pension to L. 600 . Upon this Oates altered his dress , assumed a sword , and associated with the more desperate of the popular faction , such as Rumbold , Colledge , and Fergusson . In the reign of James II ., his fortunes suffered a yet more melancholy reverse ; for , being most satisfactorily convicted of perjury , by upwards of eighty witnesses , he was sentenced to two fines of 1000 merks each ; to be whipped , on two different days , from Aldgate to Newgate , and from Newgate to Tyburn ; to be imprisoned for life , and to be pilloried five times every year . James had the imprudence to exult in this cruel punishment . He told Sir John Reresby , that the Popish plot was now dead ; and , when that courtier obsequiously answered , “ and buried , please your majesty , ” he thought the jest worth repeating , which his brother would hardly have done . It is true , no punishment could be bad enough for the author of so many legal murders ; but the severity of the sentence was an injury to the law of the land , though done through the person of so vile a criminal . The man 's impudence supported him under the conviction ; and his fortitude under the punishment was the means of regaining a share of his fallen credit . After the Revolution , he was pardoned , and received a pension of L. 400 , with the amount of which he was much dissatisfied , as well as with the refusal of the Parliament to reverse his sentence , and restore his capacity for his old trade of bearing evidence .</p>

    <p n="21">North , and other Tory writers , have affected to consider Shaftesbury as the original author of the Popish plot . Of this there is no proof whatever ; and the internal evidence derived from the account of the plot itself , is altogether inconsistent with the very idea . Shaftesbury could never have given birth to such a heap of inconsistent fables ; a plan which he had forged would have been ingenious , consistent with itself , accommodated to the circumstances of parties , and the times , and therefore , in all probability , being less suited to the vulgar palate , would not have made half the impression on the public . But we can easily believe the truth of what he is alleged to have said , “ that whoever started the game , he had the full advantage of the chase . ” In fact , this wonderful tale , probably at first invented by two or three obscure knaves , with the sordid view of profiting by the credulity of the English nation , would have fallen to the ground , had it not been fostered and cherished by Shaftesbury , who very soon perceived it could be made the means of turning out Lord Danby , and driving matters to extremity against the Catholic faction . He might well indeed exult in his management in the former particular , since Danby was the first to introduce into the House of Commons that very discussion about the plot , to which , as Shaftesbury managed it , he himself fell a sacrifice .<span corresp="#note411" type="note_anchor">[ 411 ]</span>But it was chiefly as a means of bringing forward the Bill of Exclusion , and of crushing for ever the hopes of his mortal foe the Duke of York ,<span corresp="#note412" type="note_anchor">[ 412 ]</span>that Shaftesbury became the patron of all investigations connected with the plot , pushed them on with vigour and vehemence , and dipped himself deep in the blood of the innocent persons who fell sacrifices to the popular clamour he had excited , and to evidence , which much less than Shaftesbury 's abilities might easily have discovered to be inconsistent and fabulous .</p>
    <p n="22">A humorous pamphlet , already quoted , represents Shaftesbury as abandoning his pretensions to the crown of Poland , for the purpose of following up the discovery of the Popish plot . “ In the very height of all this expectation , one night as his majesty elect lay musing upon his bed , restless with the thoughts and expectation of the approaching empire , there appeared to him , by the light of a lamp that was burning in his chamber , a dreadful and most monstrous vision . The shape and figure of it was very confused and irregular : sometimes it looked like the whore of Babylon , naked , and of immense privities ; presently , in the twinkling of an eye , the form was changed , and it appeared like a justice of the peace , strangled by a crew of ruffians , who afterwards ran him through the body with his own sword , that it might be thought he hanged himself ; on a sudden it was altered again , and seemed a troop of pilgrims , armed with black bills , that came the Lord knows whence , landed the Lord knows where , and are gone the Lord knows whither . His majesty seeing it vary so often , and so terribly , calling up all the faith he had to his assistance , boldly demanded ‘ In the name of , &amp; c. what art thou ? ’ Instantly , after a terrible clap of thunder , accompanied with several flashes of lightning , it contracted itself into the shape of a doctor of Salamanca , and , in a hideous tone , cried out , ‘ I am a PLOT . Woe to England ! farewell till 78 ; ’ and vanished . No sooner was it gone , but a stupid amazement seized upon the majesty of Poland , and cast him into a deep sleep , where he lay till morning , when , awakening , he found himself stript of all the high and aspiring thoughts that before had filled his mind ; pity and compassion towards his native country utterly cooled his ambition , and from that moment he laid by all thoughts of converting the Turk , and resolved to stay at home for confounding the pope .</p>
    <p n="23">“ Thus has this good man , ( for he is no more his majesty ,) again refused the highest promotion that perhaps any subject of England was ever raised to , merely to stand in a gap here , and slay the plague that was coming upon us . "[ 413 ]</p>

    <p n="26">In 1679 , the national discontent running exceedingly high , both on account of the Popish plot , and for other reasons , the king , by the advice of Sir William Temple , summoned a council of thirty persons , fifteen of whom were the great officers of the crown , and fifteen chosen from the country party . Shaftesbury was made president of this council , against the opinion of Temple ; and quickly found the means of pressing his favourite measure of the Exclusion Bill . Monmouth , upon whose interest in the king 's affections he had great reliance , was the person whom he proposed to nominate as successor , either by a law to be passed for the purpose , or by prevailing on the king to declare him legitimate . For this purpose , the interest of Shaftesbury was exerted to have the duke sent down to Scotland , to oppose the insurgent Covenanters , whom he defeated at Bothwell Bridge . The king 's illness , and the sudden revolution which took place in his councils , upon the unexpected return of the Duke of York from Flanders , ruined this project , and occasioned the disgrace of Monmouth , and the dismissal of Shaftesbury .</p>

    <p n="29">Sir Robert Clayton , alderman of London , and one of the representatives of the city during the two last parliaments of King Charles II ., was warmly attached to the Whig party . He took an active concern , as a magistrate , in examining the sham-plotter , Fitz-Harris ; and was charged by the Tories with an attempt to suborn that person to swear , that he had been hired by the court to fix a plot upon the Protestants . The examination of Fitz-Harris , who swore , and counter-swore , in many different ways , besides avouching that he was bribed to concoct a sham-plot , and to ascribe it to the Whigs , ( a base manœuvre , too often played off by both parties to be incredible ,) added a thousand improbable falsehoods about a Papist plot against the Protestants . When removed from the city jail , and committed to the Tower , he told another story : He was then in the power of the king , and alleged , that Howard , and others , were in a plot to seize the king 's person , and that they had employed him to contrive the aforesaid sham-plot , in order to charge upon the court the crime of subornation , &amp; c. He added , that Clayton , Bethel , Cornish , and Treby , the city-recorder , extorted from him , by threats , his previous declaration concerning the Popish plot , and used the most urgent means to compel him to impute the guilt of Godfrey 's murder to Danby , and to fix an accession to the Popish conspiracy on the queen and Duke of York . The man was executed adhering to this last story . Clayton , and the others accused of such infamous practices , exculpated themselves in a pamphlet , entitled , “ Truth Vindicated , ” in which they showed many objections to Fitz-Harris 's final declaration . We must be contented to leave the affair in mystery ; and to regret there ever was a time in England , when the character and common practices of both the leading parties in the kingdom were by no means pure enough to exempt either from such foul suspicions .</p>
    <p n="30">Sir Robert Clayton , with the other London members , all of whom were zealous Whigs , and whose re-election was hailed by the acclamations of their party ,<span corresp="#note414" type="note_anchor">[ 414 ]</span>attended the Oxford Parliament in formidable array ; they were escorted by a numerous band of armed partizans , who wore on their hats ribbons , bearing the label , “ No Popery , no Slavery , ” and were obviously prepared for something more than an usual attendance upon their duty in the House of Commons . According to Dugdale 's evidence , Sir Robert Clayton was present at a carousal at Lord Lovelace 's , near Oxford , where Colledge , one of their principal myrmidons , sung the unlucky ballad , which went so far towards his condemnation .<span corresp="#note415" type="note_anchor">[ 415 ]</span></p>
    <p n="31">The story , that Sir Robert Clayton wished to purchase a peerage , seems to have become popular . In the last will and testament of the Charter of London is this , among other jocular bequests ; “ To Sir Robert Clayton I bequeath all that the chamberlain has left of the common stock , to purchase Paddington manor , with the demesnes and appurtenances thereto , since there are now no dukedoms to be purchased ; and it is thought that Tyburn , paying his arrears next year to the city , will yield a better rate than 20l . per cent . in the banker 's hands . ” — Somers ’ Tracts , p. 185 . His usury is also hinted at in a poem called , “ The Duke of Buckingham 's Litany , ” and its consequences are enumerated among the other follies of that prodigal peer :</p>

He is accused of libertinism , in the pasquinade quoted in the last note , where the Charter of London makes him this bequest : “ To Sir Thomas Player , I leave all the manor of Moorfields , with all the wenches and bawdy-houses thereunto belonging , with Mrs Cresswells<span corresp="#note416" type="note_anchor">[ 416 ]</span>for his immediate inheritance , to enjoy and occupy all , from the bawd to the whore downward , at nineteen shillings in the pound cheaper than any other person , because he may not exhaust the chamber by paying old arrears , nor embezzle the stock by running into new scores .

    <p n="39">When the Duke of York unexpectedly returned from Brussels , on the news of the king 's illness , his arrival spread discomfiture through Shaftesbury 's party in court , and rage and alarm among those in the city . Sir Thomas Player , at the head of a numerous body of citizens , or persons who called themselves so , made his appearance before the lord-mayor , and court of aldermen ; and after having expatiated , in a set speech , upon the horrors of Popery , and upon the return of the Duke of York , whose religion had first led to the conspiracy , and whose recent arrival must necessarily give it new life , he gravely demanded , that the city-guards should be doubled , and that four companies , instead of two , should be appointed to duty every night . The lord-mayor , after some discussion , evaded Sir Thomas 's request , by referring it to the livery . In the vehemence of the chamberlain 's oratory , a remarkable expression , noticed in the text , chanced to escape him , “ that he durst hardly go to sleep , for fear of awaking with his throat cut . ” In the pretended account of this interview , he is only made to say , that it was now out of doubt , that the Papists had burnt the city ; “ And if they had not been disappointed , would have cut our throats too at the same time , while we were endeavouring to save the small remainder of our goods . ” But the publisher acknowledges , he could give but an imperfect account of the “ speech of this worthy and deserving knight , and the Lord Mayor 's generous reply thereunto . ” “ Cutting throats , ” indeed , appears to have been a frequent terror of the zealous knight . In the Westminster parliament , he made a speech on the Exclusion Bill , in which , after stating that he had read in Scripture of one man dying for a nation , but never of three nations dying for one man ; he assured the House , that they “ would be embroiled in blood before they were aware of it ; ” that he had “ no patience to think of sitting still while his throat was a cutting ; ” and therefore prayed , they would endeavour to have laws that might enable them to defend themselves .<span corresp="#note418" type="note_anchor">[ 418 ]</span>In the parliament of Oxford , Sir Thomas Player made a violent speech , upon Fitzharris being withdrawn from the city jail , and sent to the Tower , with a view , as he contended , of stifling his evidence against the Duke of York and the Papists ; and concluded by making a motion , which was carried , that if any judge , justice , or jury , should proceed upon him , and he be found guilty , they be declared guilty of his murder , and betrayers of the rights of the commons of England . In short , Sir Thomas Player was a hot-headed violent factionary ; but Rouse , one of his dependants who suffered for the Rye-house plot , with his dying breath cleared Sir Thomas of any accession to that conspiracy ; and declared , that he broke with Lord Shaftesbury , upon perceiving the violent plans which he agitated after his being freed from the Tower .

    <p n="42">Under the name of Judas , Dryden describes the famous Robert Ferguson , a native of Scotland , and , by profession , an independant preacher , and teacher of an academy at Islington .— Ath . Ox . Vol . II . p. 743 . He was one of those dark , intriguing , subtile , and ferocious characters , that emerge into notice in times of turmoil and civil dissension , and whose appearance as certainly bodes revolution , as the gambols of the porpoise announce a tempest . Through the whole of his busy and desperate career , he appears to have been guided less by any principle , moral or political , than by the mere pleasure of dealing in matters deep and dangerous , and exerting his ingenuity to shake the quiet of the kingdom at the risk of his own neck . In organizing dark and bloody intrigues ; in maintaining the courage of the zealots whom he engaged in them ; in carrying on the mystic correspondence by which the different parts of the conspiracy were to be cemented and conjoined ; in guarding against the risque of discovery , and , lastly , in effecting with nicety a hairbreadth escape when it had taken place ,— all these perilous , dubious , and criminal manœuvres , at which the noble-minded revolt , and the peaceful are terrified , were the scenes in which the genius of Ferguson delighted to exert itself . When the magistracy of London was thrown into the hands of the crown , the charter annulled , and all means of accomplishing a revolution by the ancient existing authorities , were annihilated , such a character as Ferguson became of inestimable value to Shaftesbury , considering the new plans which he had in agitation , and the persons by whom they were to be accomplished . Accordingly , he shared much of that politician 's confidence , while his influence , as a popular and violent preacher in the city , gave him every facility of selecting and training the persons fittest to assist in the meditated insurrection . His chapel , in Moorfields , was crowded with multitudes of fanatics , whom fired by his political sermons , and occasionally stimulated by libels and pamphlets , from a private press of which he had the management , as well as of a purse that maintained it . He distributed most of the pamphlets written on the Whig party , and was by no means averse to father even the most dangerous of them ; his vanity , according to Burnet , getting the better of his prudence . Some notable pieces , however , of his composition , are still known ; his style was of that diffuse , coarse , and periphrastic nature , best suited to the apprehension of the vulgar , upon whose dull intellects sentiments are always impressive , in proportion to the length of time they are forced to dwell on them . He wrote the “ Appeal from the Country to the City , ” where , in plain words , he points out the Duke of Monmouth as successor to the crown , and that because he had a dubious , or rather no title at all to claim it . “ No person is fitter than his Grace the Duke of Monmouth , as well for quality , courage , and conduct , as for that his life and fortune stand on the same bottom with yours . He will stand by you , and therefore you ought to stand by him . And remember the old rule is , He , that has the worst title , ever makes the best king ; as being constrained , by a gracious government , to supply what he wants in title ; that , instead of God and my right , his motto may be , God and my people . ” He proceeds to quote a historical example for putting Monmouth on the throne , under the tutelage of Shaftesbury , by stating that , after the death of Alexander , nothing would pacify the dissensions which ensued , “ but the choosing of King Philip 's illegitimate son , Aridæus , who , notwithstanding that he was a man but of reasonable parts himself , might , as they thought , perform the office well enough , by the help of his wise protector Perdiceas . ” This extraordinary piece is filled with the most violent declamations against the Papists , in that tawdry , bombastic , and inflammatory eloquence , wherewith , to speak according to Dryden 's parable , he “ tempted Jerusalem to sin . "[ 419 ]</p>
    <p n="43">Ferguson also wrote the second part of “ No Protestant Plot , ” another very violent pamphlet , and several treatises on the same subject . Meanwhile , other means were prepared to effect the desired change of government . It is not necessary to enter particularly into the well-known history of the Rye-house plot . Every body knows , that , while Russel , Sidney , Monmouth , and others , undertook to raise an insurrection in the country , Shaftesbury promised to head ten thousand brisk boys in the city of London . Among these brisk boys were a fanatic party , who agitated projects of assassinating the King and the Duke of York , unknown to the more generous nobles , who proposed only to secure the king 's person . In all and each of these cabals , Ferguson acted a distinguished part . When Shaftesbury fled from his house into lurking places about Wapping , he trusted Ferguson with the secret of his residence , although concealed from the noble-minded Russel , and the generous Monmouth . By his intervention , he heartened and encouraged the associates to break forth into open insurrection . With the inferior conspirators , Ferguson was yet more intimate , and seems , in fact , to have given life to the vague and desperate plans of lopping , as they called the assassination of the royal brothers , by the countenance which he pretended to procure the conspirators from those of superior rank . He told West , he would procure the Duke of Monmouth 's written consent to his father 's murder ; although he afterwards allowed , he durst not even mention such a plan to him . At length , when Shaftesbury , weary of the delays of the other conspirators , left England for ever , Ferguson and Walcot were the companions of his flight . By this the plan of insurrection was for a time confounded , for the higher order of the malcontents were ignorant of the lines of communication by which the city cabal was conducted . Ferguson was therefore recalled , and in an evil hour returned from Holland . His arrival gave new life both to the upper and inferior conspiracy : in the former , six of the leaders formed themselves into a regular committee , to extend their influence and correspondence through the kingdom , and unite measures with the disaffected in Scotland . The lower band of assassins matured and prepared their plan for assassinating the king and duke as they returned from Newmarket . Ferguson , who still acted in the capacity of treasurer , which Dryden has assigned him , paid for the arms provided for the enterprize ; and , by his daring language , encouraged them to proceed . He offered , in mockery , to consecrate the blunderbuss with which Rumbold was to fire into the carriage ; and when Sunday was fixed for the day of action , he quoted the old Scottish proverb , “ the better day , the better deed . ” Even when , by the treachery of Keeling , the plot was finally discovered , and the conspirators were dispersing in dismay and terror , Ferguson took his leave of them with great gaiety , and , trusting to the plots of Argyle and Jerviswood , with which he was also intimate , told them , he hoped to meet them all at Dunbar . This indifference , at such a crisis , led to a supposition , that he had some secret correspondence with government : it was even said , that the messenger who arrested Ferguson suffered him to escape , but of this there seems no evidence . He retired to Holland , where he joined the unfortunate Monmouth , and was a principal agent in pushing him on to his western invasion , when , if left to himself , he would have remained in quiet . He drew the proclamation which Monmouth issued at his landing , a prolix , ill-worded production , stuffed with all the true , and all the false accusations against James II ., and where the last so much drowned the others , that it was only calculated to make an impression on the lowest vulgar . He was always earnest with Monmouth , to take upon himself the title of king ; and may be said to have contributed greatly to every false step which he made , and to the final destruction in which they ended . Of this Monmouth was so sensible , that he told the king in their last interview , “ That Ferguson was chiefly the person who instigated him to set up his title of king , and had been a main adviser and contriver of the whole affair , as well to the attempting , as acting , what had been done ; ” but he had little to answer when Halifax expressed his surprise , that he should have given ear to him who , as he had long before told the late king , “ was a bloody rogue , and always advised to the cutting of throats . ” Ferguson was taken , on this occasion , the third day after the battle of Sedgemore . Yet , when so much blood was spilt , both with , and without the forms of law , this man , who had been most active in the conspiracy against the king , when Duke of York , and had now organized an invasion and insurrection in his dominions , was , by the inexorable James , freely pardoned and dismissed , to council and assist the next conspiracy . Perhaps his life was saved by Sunderland , lest he had disclosed what he probably knew of his intercourse with the Prince of Orange , and even with Monmouth himself . Ferguson seems , on his liberation , to have returned to Holland ; and did not fail to take a share in the intrigues which preceded the Revolution . He managed the dissenters for the interest of the Prince of Orange ; and endeavoured to press upon William a sense of their importance . But other , and more important engines , were now at work ; and Ferguson seems to have enjoyed but a subaltern consideration : Burnet , who made such a figure in the expedition , avers , he did not even know him by sight .<span corresp="#note420" type="note_anchor">[ 420 ]</span>When the Prince of Orange was at Exeter , the dissenters refused him the keys of their meeting house . But Ferguson was accustomed to surmount greater obstacles . “ I will take , ” said he , laughing , “ the kingdom of heaven by storm , ” and broke open the door with his own hand . After the Revolution was accomplished , one would have thought Ferguson 's machinations might have ended . He had seen his party triumphant ; he had been rewarded with a good post ;<span corresp="#note421" type="note_anchor">[ 421 ]</span>and , what was probably dearer to him than either principle or profit , his intrigues had successfully contributed to the achievement of a great change of government . But it was not in his nature to be in repose ; and , having spent all the former part of his life in caballing to drive James from the throne , he now engaged with the same fervour in every conspiracy for his restoration . In the very year which succeeded that of the Revolution , we find him deeply engaged with Sir James Montgomery , and the other Scottish presbyterians , who , discontented with King William , had united with the Jacobites . The Marquis of Anandale having absconded on account of his share in this conspiracy , Ferguson secreted him for several weeks ; a kindness which the Marquis repaid , by betraying him to government .<span corresp="#note422" type="note_anchor">[ 422 ]</span>With his usual good fortune , he was dismissed ; either in consideration of former services , or because a full proof against him was not to be obtained . After this , he continued to engage in every plot against the government ; and each year published one or two pamphlets , which put his ears , if not his neck , in peril . His last grand exhibition was an attack upon Trenchard , the secretary of state , for the use of blank and general warrants .<span corresp="#note423" type="note_anchor">[ 423 ]</span>But that adventure , as the romance writers say , was reserved for another demagogue . Finally , Ferguson , who had in this remarkable manner kept his promise of being engaged in every conspiracy of his time , and , had gained the honourable epithet of “ The Plotter , ” died quietly , and in peace , after having repeatedly seen the scaffold stream with the blood of the associates of his various machinations . One touch alone softens the character of this extraordinary incendiary . In all his difficulties , he is never charged with betraying his associates . His person is thus remarkably described in the proclamation for apprehending his person , among the other Rye-house assassins .</p>

    <p n="48">Of James Forbes I can give but a slight account . He was placed by the Duke of Ormond as travelling tutor to the young Earl of Derby , who had married his grand-daughter . Carte says , he was a gentleman of parts , virtue , and prudence , but of too mild a nature to manage his pupil . In Paris the earl addicted himself to the society of one Merrit , a worthless profligate ; and the governor having cautioned his charge against this acquaintance , was assaulted at disadvantage by Merrit , and dangerously wounded . Lord Derby , it seems , not only countenanced Merrit 's assault upon Mr Forbes , but , at the instigation of some young French rakes , consented to his governor 's being tossed in a blanket . The Duke of Ormond , finding that the earl was wild and impatient of restraint , and that his tutor 's sage remonstrances had but little effect , recalled Forbes , and sent in his stead Colonel Thomas Fairfax , a gallant and brave man , and roughly honest . Lord Derby was at first restiff ; but Fairfax telling him plainly , that he was sent to govern him , and would govern him , and that his lordship must submit , and should do it , the young nobleman had the sense to comply , broke off his evil acquaintances , and behaved ever after with great propriety .<span corresp="#note424" type="note_anchor">[ 424 ]</span>Forbes 's misadventures in Paris , though , according to Carte , they inferred no real dishonour , are severely alluded to by Dryden in the text .

    <p n="51">The Reverend Samuel Johnson , a party-writer of considerable merit . He was a native of Warwickshire , and took orders after a regular course of study at Cambridge . He obtained the small living of Curingham , in Essex , by the patronage of a Mr Biddolph . The emoluments of this benefice did not exceed eighty pounds a-year ; and it was the only church preferment he ever enjoyed . Dryden alludes to his poverty in describing his original situation . Mr Johnson 's patron , observing his turn for politics , exhorted him to study the English constitution in Bracton and Fortescue ; but by no means to make his sermons the vehicle for his political sentiments . The opinions which he formed in the course of study , were such as recommended him as chaplain to the famous Lord Russell .</p>
    <p n="52">While he was in this situation , and during the dependance of the Bill of Exclusion , he endeavoured at once to show the danger to a national religion from a sovereign who held opposite tenets , and to explode the doctrine of passive obedience , in a work entitled , “ Julian the Apostate ; with a short Account of his Life , and a Parallel betwixt Popery and Paganism . ” In this performance , according to Wood , he was assisted by Thomas Hunt the lawyer . This book , which made a good deal of noise at the time , was answered by the learned Hickes , in a treatise called “ Jovian , ” in which , according to Anthony a Wood , the doctor hath , with unquestionable clearness , laid open the folly , “ ignorance , weakness , and pernicious drift of that traitorous scribbler . ” Without entering into the controversy , there can be little doubt , that , so far as the argument from the example of the primitive Christians is sound , Johnson has fairly made out his case . Indeed Dryden has little left to say , except , that if they did resist Julian , which he seems to admit , they were very wrong in so doing , and the less that is said about it , the more will be the credit of the ancient church . Johnson prepared a reply to “ Jovian , ” called , the “ Arts of Julian to undermine Christianity ; ” but the Rye-house Plot having intervened , he did not judge it prudent to publish it . He was called before the Privy Council , who insisted upon knowing why this book , which had been entered at Stationers Hall , was not published ? His answer alleged , that the ferment of the nation was so great as to render the further discussion of the question imprudent . They then demanded a copy of the book ; and added , that , if they approved it , it should be published . To this insidious proposal he boldly replied , that , having suppressed the book , it only contained his private thoughts , which he could be compelled to disclose to no man on earth . For this answer he was committed to prison , and his house searched for the copies , which had fortunately been bestowed elsewhere . The court finding themselves unable to reach Johnson for not publishing his second work , determined to try him for publishing his first . Accordingly , he was brought to the bar and insulted by Jefferies , who told him , he would give him a text , “ Let every man study to be quiet , and mind his own business . ” — “ I minded my business as an Englishman , ” answered this spirited man , “ when I wrote that book . ” All defence was in vain ; he was condemned to a heavy fine , and to lie in jail till it was paid , which in his circumstances was equal to a sentence of perpetual imprisonment . Even from his prison house , where he lay for five years , amid the accumulated distresses of sickness and poverty , he let his countrymen hear his voice , and failed not to enter an animated and vigorous protest against each new encroachment upon the liberty and religion of England .<span corresp="#note425" type="note_anchor">[ 425 ]</span>At length , having published “ An humble and hearty Address to all the English Protestants in this present Army ,"[ 426 ] exhorting them not to serve as instruments to eradicate their religion and enslave their country , he again fell under the grasp of power , was tried and sentenced to be thrice pilloried , and whipped from Newgate to Tyburn ; having been previously degraded from his ecclesiastical orders . He bore both the previous ceremony of degradation , and the cruel punishment which followed , with the greatest magnanimity . When they disrobed him , he told the divines present , that he could not but grieve , since all he had written was to keep the gowns on their backs , they should nevertheless be the unhappy instruments to pull off his . When they put a Bible into his hand as a part of the formality of degradation , and again took it from him , he was much affected , and said with tears , they could not , however , deprive him of the use and benefit of that sacred deposit .<span corresp="#note427" type="note_anchor">[ 427 ]</span>On the 1st of December , 1686 , he suffered the remainder of his inhuman sentence ; the pain being his , but the infamy that of the persons who imposed it .</p>
    <p n="53">After the Revolution , the proceedings against this staunch patriot were declared illegal ; and he received a pension of L. 300 yearly , with L. 1000 in money , and a post for his son . Crewe , Bishop of Durham , who acted as one of the commissioners for discharging the duty of the Bishop of London , and as such was active in Mr Johnson 's degradation , compounded with him against a suit at law , by payment of a handsome sum . Yet Johnson 's dangers were not over ; for , such was the enmity of the adherents of King James against him , that a party of desperate assassins broke into his house by night , beat , wounded , and threatened to pistol him , for the books he had written ; but , upon his wife 's intreaties , at length desisted from their bloody design . The latter part of his days were spent in quietness and independence .</p>
    <p n="54">The reader may contrast the character which Dryden has given of Johnson , with that of Hampden , who , in an account of him to the Duchess of Mazarine , says ; “ Being two years with him in the same prison , I had the opportunity to know him perfectly well ; and , to speak my thoughts of him in one word , I can assure your Grace , that I never knew a man of better sense , of a more innocent life , nor of greater virtue , which was proof against all temptation , than Mr Johnson . ” — See Memorials of his Life prefixed to his Works in folio .</p>

    <p n="57">The famous Gilbert Burnet was then lecturer at St Clements , and preacher at the Rolls chapel , under the patronage of Sir Harbottle Grimstone , Master of the Rolls . King Charles was so anxious that he should be dismissed , as to make it his particular request to Sir Harbottle ; but the Master excused himself . It was here he preached that famous sermon on the day of the Gunpowder Treason , 5th November , 1684 , when he chose for his text , “ Save me from the lion 's mouth , thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns ; ” which , in spite of the doctor 's protestations to the contrary , certain suspicious persons considered as an allusion to the supporters of the king 's arms . For this he was finally disgraced , and turned out of the chapel of the Rolls . See note on the Buzzard , in the “ Hind and Panther . ”</p>

    <p n="60">Samuel Pordage , a minor poet and dramatist of the time , drew this passing sarcasm on his person and pedigree , by a stupid poem , called “ Azariah and Hushai , ” published 1681-2 ; being an attempt to imitate or answer “ Absalom and Achitophel : ” with what success the reader may judge , from the following character of Dryden :</p>
    <p n="61">Shimei , the poet laureat of that age , The falling glory of the Jewish stage , Who scourged the priest , and ridiculed the plot , Like common men , must not be quite forgot . Sweet was the muse that did his wit inspire , Had he not let his hackney muse to hire : But variously his knowing muse could sing , Could Doeg praise , and could blaspheme the king ; The bad make good , good bad , and bad make worse . Bless in heroics , and in satires curse . Shimei to Zabed 's<span corresp="#note428" type="note_anchor">[ 428 ]</span>praise could tune his muse , And princely Azaria could abuse . Zimri , we know , he had no cause to praise , Because he dubbed him with the name of Bayes : Revenge on him did bitter venom shed , Because he tore the laurel from his head ; Because he durst with his proud wit engage , And brought his follies on the public stage . Tell me , Apollo , for I can n't divine , Why wives he cursed , and praised the concubine ; Unless it were , that he had led his life With a teeming matron , ere she was a wife ; Or that it best with his dear muse did suit , Who was for hire a very prostitute .</p>
    <p n="62">He also stepped forward to break a lance with our author , on the subject of Shaftesbury 's acquittal ; and answered the “ Medal ” by a very stupid poem , called the “ Medal Reversed . ” To all this scurrilous doggrel , Dryden only replied by the single couplet above quoted . He calls Mephibosheth “ the wizard 's son , ” because the Reverend John Pordage , vicar of Bradfield , in Berkshire , and father of the poet , Samuel , was ejected from his cure by the commissioners of Berkshire , for conversation with evil spirits , and for blasphemy , ignorance , scandalous behaviour , devilism , uncleanness , and heaven knows what . His case of insufficiency is among the State Trials , from which he seems to have been a crazy enthusiast , who believed in a correspondence with genii and dæmons .</p>
    <p n="63">Samuel Pordage was a member of the society of Lincoln 's Inn . He wrote three plays , namely , the “ Troades , ” translated from Seneca , “ Herod and Mariamne , ” and “ The Siege of Babylon . ” He also published a romance called “ Eliana , ” and prepared a new edition of “ God 's Revenge against Murder , ” which was published after his death . Pordage was , moreover , author of “ Heroic Stanzas on his Majesty 's Coronation , 1661 , ” and probably of other occasional pieces , deservedly doomed to oblivion .</p>

    <p n="69">Elkanah Settle , whose original quarrel with our author is detailed in the introductory remarks to their prose controversy , had now further incensed him , by tergiversation in politics : For Elkanah , although originally a Tory , was induced , probably by his connections as poet-laureat for the city , to go over to the party of Monmouth and Shaftesbury .<span corresp="#note429" type="note_anchor">[ 429 ]</span>His new friends made use of his talents in a two-fold capacity . Shaftesbury employed him to write a pamphlet in favour of the Exclusion , entitled , “ The Character of a Popish Successor . ” When Settle afterwards recanted , he said , this piece , which made some noise at the time , was retouched by “ his noble friend in Aldersgate Street , ” whose only objection was , that it was not sufficiently violent in favour of insurrection . Settle , having a mechanical turn , was also employed as chief engineer at the solemn pope-burning , which we have so often mentioned ; in which charge he acquitted himself much to the satisfaction of his employers . On account of his literary and mechanical merits , Sir Roger L'Estrange allots him the double office of poet-laureat and master of the ordnance to the Whig faction , in the following passage of a dialogue between Jest and Earnest :</p>
    <p n="70">“ Jest . For instance , I knew a lusty fellow , who would not willingly be thought valiant ,<span corresp="#note430" type="note_anchor">[ 430 ]</span>who has an indifferent hand at making of crackers , serpents , rockets , and the other playthings that are proper on the 5th of November ; and has for such his skill received applause , and victuals , from the munificent gentlemen about Temple-bar .</p>
    <p n="71">“ Earnest . And he , I 'll warrant , is made master of the ordnance ?</p>
    <p n="72">“ Jest . True ; and I think him very fit for it . But he 's like to have another employment , of a strangely different nature ; for , because this dull wretch , once upon a time , wrote a fulsomely nonsensical poem , in prose , being a character of a bugbear , he , forsooth , is designed poet-laureat too !</p>
    <p n="73">“ Earnest . These two offices , as you say , one would think , should require diverse accomplishments : But then it may be said , that these may well enough be supplied by one man ; the poet to make ballads in peace , and betake himself to his other business in war .</p>
    <p n="74">“ Jest . Nay , his squibs and his poems have much what the same fortune ; they crack and bounce , and the boys and girls laugh at them .</p>
    <p n="75">“ Earnest . Well , how great are the advantages ! I thought the author of the satyric work upon the “ Observator , ” and Heraclitus , or the Person of Honour , that obliged the pie-folks with poetical reflections upon “ Absalom and Achitophel ; ” I say , I thought these forsaken scribblers might have bid fairest for the evergreen twig .</p>
    <p n="76">“ Jest . I thought so too ; but hunger will break stone-walls . Elk . promises to vindicate Lucifer 's first rebellion for a few guineas . Poor Absalom and Achitophel must e'en hide themselves in the Old Testament again ; and I question whether they 'll be safe there from the fury of this mighty Cacadoggin .</p>
    <p n="77">“ Earnest . Silly chit ! has he not learned the apologue of the Serpent and the File ? But fare him well . ” — Heraclitus Redens , No . 50 .</p>
    <p n="78">From the last part of this passage , it appears that Settle was then labouring upon his answer to “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” for which Dryden condemned him to a disgraceful immortality . At length he came forth with “ Absalom Senior , or Achitophel Transprosed . "[ 431 ]</p>
    <p n="79">In this piece Dryden 's plan is followed , by applying the names and history of scripture to modern persons and events . Thus , Queen Elizabeth is Deborah , and Sir Francis Drake , Barak ; the Papists are the worshippers of Baal , and the Duke of York is Absalom . This circumstance did not escape the wit of Dryden , who says of Settle , in the text ,</p>
    <p n="80">For almonds he 'll cry whore to his own mother , Or call young Absalom King David 's brother .</p>
    <p n="81">Indeed , Elkanah seems himself to have been sensible of the absurdity of this personification , by which the king 's brother , almost as old as himself , was converted into the blooming son of David ; and apologizes , in his preface addressed to the Tories , for “ the freedom of clapping but about a score of years extraordinary on the back of Absalom . Neither is it , ” he continues , “ altogether so unpardonable a poetical licence ; since we find as great slips from the author of your own ‘ Absalom , ’ where we see him bring in a Zimri into the court of David , who , in the scripture story , died by the hand of Phineas , in the days of Moses .<span corresp="#note432" type="note_anchor">[ 432 ]</span>Nay , in the other extreme , we find him , in another place , talking of the martyrdom of Stephen , so many ages after ; and , if so famous an author can forget his own rules of unity , time , and place , I hope you 'll give a minor poet some grains of allowance . ”</p>

    <p n="84">As Settle 's poems have long fallen into total oblivion , from which his name has only been rescued by the satirical pen of Dryden , and as he was once thought no unequal rival for that great poet , the reader may be curious to see a specimen of his style ; I have therefore inserted the few of the leading characters of “ Absalom Senior , ” in which he has “ rhymed and rattled ” with most tolerable success .</p>

    <p n="95">But , as was reasonably to be expected , Settle has exerted his whole powers of satire and poetry in the description of his antagonist Dryden : And here let me remark , that almost all the adversaries of our author commence their attack , by an unwilling compliment to his poetical powers :</p>
    <p n="96">But Amiel<span corresp="#note434" type="note_anchor">[ 434 ]</span>had , alas ! the fate to hear An angry poet play his chronicler ; A poet raised above Oblivion 's shade , By his recorded verse immortal made .

Near those bright towers , where Art has wonders done , } And at his feet proud Jordan 's waters run , } Where David 's sight glads the blest summer 's sun , } A cell there stands , by pious founders raised , Both for its wealth and learned rabbins praised ; To this did an ambitious bard aspire . To be no less than lord of that blest choir ; Till wisdom deemed so sacred a command A prize too great for his unhallowed hand . Besides , lewd Fame had told his plighted vow To Laura 's cooing love , perched on a drooping bough ; Laura , in faithful constancy confined To Ethiop 's envoy , and to all mankind ; Laura , though rotten , yet of mould divine , He had all her ——, and she had all his coin ; Her wit so far his purse and sense could drain . Till every —— was sweetened to a strain ; And if at last his nature can reform , As weary grown of love 's tumultuous storm . ‘ Tis age 's fault , not his , of power bereft ,— He left not whoring , but of that was left .</p>
    <p n="97">Settle 's end was utterly inglorious . In 1683 , he deserted the cause of the Whigs , and returned to that of the Tories ; for whom he wrote several periodical tracts , in one of which , entitled , “ A Narrative , ” he accused his old patron Shaftesbury of correcting the famous “ Character of a Popish Successor ; ” and objecting , that it did not speak favourably enough of rebellion .<span corresp="#note435" type="note_anchor">[ 435 ]</span>Whether compelled by poverty , or through zeal for the royal cause , he became a trooper in King James 's army , when it was encamped on Hounslow-Heath .<span corresp="#note436" type="note_anchor">[ 436 ]</span>Finally , he took the prophetic hint conveyed in Dryden 's lines , and became , not indeed the master , but the assistant , to a puppet-show , kept by a Mrs Minns , in Bartholomew-fair . Thus , the expression , which Dryden had chiefly used in contemptuous allusion to the share which Settle had in directing the Pope-burning , and the fire-works which accompanied it , was literally fulfilled .<span corresp="#note437" type="note_anchor">[ 437 ]</span>Nay , poor Elkanah , in his old age , was at length obliged not only to write for the puppet-show , but to appear in it as a performer , inclosed in a case representing a green dragon of his own proper device .

    <p n="103">Our author had very shortly before the publication of the second part of “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” made his enemy , Shadwell , the subject of a separate and cutting personal satire , called “ Mac Flecnoe . ” That poem , as we have noticed in the introductory remarks , has reference principally to the literary character of his adversary ; while , in the lines which follow , he considers him chiefly as a political writer , and factionary of the popular party . Shadwell 's corpulence , his coarse and brutal debauchery , his harsh and clumsy style of poetry , fell under the lash on both occasions ; and it is astonishing , with what a burning variety of colours these qualities are represented . The history of his literary disputes with Dryden may be perused in the introduction to “ Mac Flecnoe . ” In the “ Vindication of the Duke of Guise , ” Dryden has also given a severe flagellation to his corpulent adversary , in which he says , “ that although Shadwell has often called him an atheist in print , he believes more charitably of his antagonist , and that he only goes the broad way , because the other is too narrow for him . ”</p>
    <p n="104">Besides avenging abundance of personal abuse , Dryden , in the person of Shadwell , chastises a great supporter of the Whig cause and principles . Shadwell himself complains , that , in the days of Charles and James , he “ was silenced for a non-conformist poet . ” He was the chief among the “ corrector-men , ” as the authors and publishers of the Whig party were oddly entitled ;<span corresp="#note438" type="note_anchor">[ 438 ]</span>and received the reward of his principles at the Revolution , succeeding , as is well known , our author in the office of poet laureat . In the epilogue to the “ Volunteers , ” a play of Shadwell 's , acted after his death , the friends of the Revolution are called upon to applaud their favourite bard 's last production :</p>
    <p n="105">Crown you his last performance with applause , Who love , like him , our liberties and laws ; Let but the honest party do him right , And their loud claps will give him fame , in spite Of the faint hiss of grumbling Jacobite .</p>

    <p n="108">The reader will find some account of the King 's Head Club , Vol . VII . p. 154 . North gives the following lively account of the vulgar , as he calls them , of the popular faction . Their employ , according to him , was , “ to run about whispering here and there , by which management they kept up the spirits of their fools , whose fire , without a continual pabulum of fresh news , talks , and hopes , would go out . Amongst these , the cues and hints went about ; honest , drunken , lying fellows , good company , and always dear friends . A nod , with a wink , had a notable signification , if it followed , ‘ Have patience , you shall see . ’ — ‘ I know somewhat extraordinary will be done shortly and soon , which will secure all on our side . ’ And thus passively wicked were these underlings , or fry of the party : they knew of the intrigue no more , and were concerned as the wood of drums and the brass of trumpets are in the war . "[ 439 ] — “ The pastime of this meeting , called the Club , was very engaging to young gentlemen , and one , who had once tasted the conversation , could scarcely ever quit it . For some or others were continually coming and going , to import or export news or stories , as the trade required and afforded . There it was known in half an hour , what any member said at the committee of elections , or in the house , if it sat late . And every post carried the news and tales legitimated there , as also the malign constructions of all the good actions of the government , especially to places where elections were depending to shape men 's characters into fit qualifications to be chosen or rejected . The Pope himself could not make saints so readily as they Papists , and so half-three-quarter Papists , as belief was prompt or difficult . And a lewd atheistical fellow was as readily washed clean , and made a zealous Protestant . For that genus of perfection was not wanted in this dispensation , where no vice , immorality , heresy , atheism , or blasphemous wit , had not professors ready to embrace willing disciples , who , for the sake of such sublimities of wit and sense as they were accounted , were ready to prostitute all principles of duty , and especially those that regarded allegiance to the crown . "[ 440 ]</p>
    <p n="109">The well-known distinction of this famous club was a green ribband : in opposition to which , the Tories wore in their hats a scarlet ribband , with the motto , Rex et Hæredes . The prologue to “ Anna Bullen ” very sensibly expostulates against these party badges :</p>

    <p n="113">Sir William Waller , son of the parliamentary general of the same name , distinguished himself during the time of the Popish plot , by an uncommon decree of bustling activity . He was a justice of peace ; and , unawed by the supposed fate of his brother in the commission , and in knighthood , Sir Edmondbury Godfrey , he stood forth the bold investigator of this bottomless conspiracy . It was he who had the fortune , by the assistance of Captain Dangerfield , to detect what was called the Meal-Tub Plot , which that fellow , who had been trafficking with both factions , and probably meant to cheat both , chose to represent as a sham conspiracy , contrived to ruin Shaftesbury and his friends . Upon this occasion , Sir William had much closeting with a magnanimous midwife , called Mrs Cellier , whom Dangerfield charged as an agent of the court , and who afterwards alleged , that the knight took some uncommon means to extort confessions from her . Sir William Waller was also the person who discovered Fitzharris 's Plot ; and he intimated , that the king , who intended to turn it upon the Protestants , was so much displeased with his blowing up the project , that he threatened to have him assassinated . The Tories alleged , that the pleasure of making these discoveries was not Sir William 's sole reward , any more than zeal was his only motive for gutting the Popish chapels . “ In which , ” says North , “ he proceeded with such scandalous rigour , as to bring forth the pictures and other furniture of great value , and burn them publicly ; which gave occasion to suspect , and some said positively , that , under this pretence , he kept good things for himself ; in a word , he was called the priest-catcher . "[ 441 ] Anthony Wood joins in the accusation of his rifling the Papists ’ houses of goods , and appropriating chapel ornaments as popish trinkets . I find that respectable person , Miles Prance , the witness , enters into a solemn vindication of the justice , from the practices alleged by North , Wood , and by the poet . “ Another damnable scandal they have broached , which , though it be principally levelled at Sir William Waller , as if he , under pretence of searching for priests , and seizing popish trinkets , should take away money , plate , and other things of value from the owners , and necklaces of pearl for beads ; yet , since I very frequently went along with him , it does obliquely reflect upon me , and I cannot but do that worthy gentleman the right to justify him against such a most false , groundless , and malicious slander : I do therefore declare , in the presence of God , and shall be ready to attest upon oath , that whensoever I attended him in searches , which was almost every day , I could never discover in him the least inclination to any such base practices ; but that , to the contrary , he behaved himself as a good Christian and just magistrate ; for , wherever we came , what money we found was left in the owner 's possession ; and as for chalices , and pieces of plate belonging to priests , and used in their mass , or for keeping of holy oil , we did indeed batter or break them to pieces , but always returned all the pieces to the proprietors . But their copes and priestly vestments , superstitious pictures , habits of monks belonging to their peculiar orders , and such like trumpery , we did sometimes take away , and cause them to be publicly burned , never making any advantage thereof . And as to any necklaces of pearl , reported to be by him taken away , I am more than confident the same is as arrand a lie , as that he thought one Bedingfield , whom he took at Newark , to have been the same Bedingfield , who died in the Gatehouse ; for he well knew it was another man .

    <p n="117">The Whigs of those days had constant recourse to the desperate remedy of refusing supplies , when dissatisfied with the court . This ultimate measure ought only to be adopted in cases of extremity ; because the want of means to maintain the usual current expences for the law , and the defence of the country , gives a perilous shock to the whole system of government . At that time , however , it was held so effectual a check , and so necessary , that the Whig citizens , in a paper of instructions furnished to their representatives in 1680-1 , having thanked them for their good service , more especially for their zeal for the Exclusion Bill , proceed to recommend , “ that they would still literally pursue the same measures , and grant no supplies to the crown , till they saw themselves effectually secured from popery and arbitrary power . ”</p>

    <p n="120">In 1678-9 , when the plot hung like a comet over England , the king thought it necessary to assent to the counsel of the Earl of Danby , and request the Duke of York to give way to the storm , and silence the popular clamour , by retreating for a season to the Continent . The Duke requested a particular order , lest it should be supposed he fled from a consciousness of guilt . The order was in these words : “ I have already given you my resolution at large , why I think it fit that you absent yourself some time beyond the seas . As I am truly sorry for the occasion , so you may be sure I shall never desire it longer than it may be absolutely necessary for your good and my service . In the meantime , I think proper to give it you under my hand , that I expect this compliance from you , and desire it may be as soon as conveniently you can . You may easily perceive with what trouble I write this to you , there being nothing I am more sensible of than the kindness you have ever had for me . I hope you are as just to me , as to be assured , that no absence , nor any thing else , can ever change me from being truly and kindly yours , C. R. February 28th 1678-9 . ” Superscribed , “ For my most dear friend the Duke of York . ”</p>
    <p n="121">Authors differ concerning the “ store of parting tears , ” which were shed on the separation of the royal brothers . Burnet says , that the duke wept much , but the king did not seem affected . Others affirm , that both brothers testified much emotion . The duke retired to Brussels , where he remained till the time of the king 's illness , so often mentioned .</p>

    <p n="124">That Charles II . was a pensioner of France , is now generally allowed . But , though Louis was willing to afford the king of England such supplies as to save him from the necessity of throwing himself on his parliament , it was equally his policy to foster such opposition to him in that assembly , as might totally engage the eyes of both parties upon domestic feuds , and withdraw them from marking his own ambitious strides towards universal power . For this it was necessary , that his minister Barillon should have an understanding with the leaders of the popular party . Hence each faction , as truly as loudly , accused the other of the unworthy dependence on France , to which both were in secret reduced . An account of the French intrigues with the popular party , and of the money distributed among their chiefs , may be found in Dalrymple 's Memoirs .</p>

    <p n="127">In some respects , the presence of the Duke of York in Scotland was very acceptable to the nobles and gentry of that kingdom . There is , among Somers ’ Tracts , a letter from a person of quality in Scotland , who professes , that , although a zealous Protestant , he had been converted from his opinion in favour of the Bill of Exclusion , by “ the personal knowledge of his very many excellencies and virtues . ” Doubtless , many circumstances drew the Scots to the faction and favour of the Duke . They saw the halls of their ancient palace again graced with the appearance of royalty , and occupied by a descendant of their long line of kings . The formal , grave , and stately decorum of James , was more suitable to the manners of a proud , reserved , and somewhat pedantic people , than the lighter manners of Charles . The proud , as well as the ingenious , know , and feel , the value of favours conferred by those who resemble them . York applied himself particularly to secure the personal attachment of the Highland chiefs , and to staunch the feuds by which their clans were divided . He , no doubt , reckoned upon the assistance of these ready warriors , in case the sword had been drawn in England ; but he little foresaw , that the last hopes of his family were to depend on the generous attachment of the descendants of the chieftains whom he then cultivated , and that his race were to involve in their fall the ruin of the patriarchal and feudal power of these faithful adherents . But if the conduct of James in these particulars was laudable , on the other hand , by introducing an inconsistent and absurd test into the law , by making it the means of ruining a loyal and innocent nobleman , the Earl of Argyle , by satiating his own eyes with the tortures inflicted on the Covenanters ,— he gave tokens of that ill-judged and bigotted severity , which was the cause of his being precipitated from the throne . Settle gives a juster , if a less poetical , account of the manner in which he spent his exile :</p>
    <p n="128">Whilst sweating Absalon , in Israel pent , For fresher air was to bleak Hebron sent ,— Cold Hebron , warmed by his approaching sight , Flushed with his gold , and glowed with new delight ,— Till sacred , all-converting interest , To loyalty their almost unknown guest , Oped a broad gate , from whence forth issuing come Decrees , tests , oaths , for well-soothed Absalom .</p>

    <p n="131">Admiral Legge , created Earl of Dartmouth by Charles II ., and a particular friend of the Duke of York . When James came to the throne , he loaded Dartmouth with favours , and paid a singular testimony to the family loyalty , celebrated in the text . In 1687 , while the earl attended the king on his progress , the city of Coventry presented his majesty with a massive gold cup , which he instantly delivered to Lord Dartmouth , telling him , it was an acknowledgement from the city for the sufferings of his father , who had long lain in jail there , on account of his adherence to the king during the civil wars . In the succeeding year , Dartmouth was made admiral of the fleet of England . He was , perhaps , the worthiest man , and most faithful servant , in the court of King James , whom he truly loved and served , though he disapproved of his arbitrary encroachments , and spoke his mind on the subject without fear or scruple . Although a hereditary enemy of Lord Russell , Dartmouth had the generosity to interfere in his favour . He set sail from Torbay , with the English fleet , to intercept that of the Prince of Orange , at the time of the Revolution . Had they met , a bloody action must have been the consequence ; but God ordered it otherwise . The same wind , which carried the Dutch fleet into Torbay , forced back the English to the Downs ; and before Dartmouth could again put to sea , the officers and sailors were as unwilling to resist the Prince of Orange , as the nobles and land army . When Lord Dartmouth found it was entirely out of his power to serve King James , he called a council of war , and joined in an address to King William . In 1691-2 , he was committed to the Tower , on suspicion of holding correspondence with his old master .</p>

    <p n="134">General Edward Sackville , a gentleman of good quality , related to the Dorset family , who had served at Tangier with great reputation , both for courage and judgment . Being a particular friend of the Duke of York , he expressed himself very contemptuously concerning the Popish conspiracy , saying , “ they were sons of whores who believed there was a plot , and he was a lying rogue that said it . ” The Commons , being then in the very height of their fermentation on this subject , not only expelled Sackville from the House , but prepared an address to the king , that he might be made incapable of holding any office . He was committed to the Tower , but shortly afterwards set free , and restored to his military rank , though not to his seat in the House . After noticing Dartmouth , Sackville , and the other real friends of the Duke of York , the poet stigmatizes those concealed enemies , who now affected to congratulate his return :</p>
    <p n="135">—— —— Those who sought his absence to betray , Press first their nauseous false respects to pay ; Him still the officious hypocrites molest , And with officious duty break his rest .</p>
    <p n="136">A marginal note on Luttrell 's copy points out the Earl of Anglesea as particularly concerned in this sarcasm . In a prologue , spoken before the duke at his first appearance at the theatre after his return , Dryden is equally severe on these time-serving courtiers :</p>
    <p n="137">Still we are thronged so full with Reynard 's race , That loyal subjects scarce can find a place . Thus modest truth is cast behind the crowd , Truth speaks too low , hypocrisy too loud . Let them be first to flatter in success ; Duty can stay , but guilt has need to press .</p>

    <p n="140">The Duke of York maintained some interest in the city , by being captain-general of the Artillery Company , who invited him to dine at Merchant-Taylors ’ Hall , on April 21 , 1682 . The party of Monmouth and Shaftesbury resolved to have a meeting in opposition to that which was proposed ; and tickets , at a guinea a piece , of which the following is a copy , were circulated among their adherents :</p>
    <p n="141">“ It having pleased Almighty God , by his wonderful providence , to deliver and protect his majesties person , the Protestant religion , and English liberties , hitherto from the hellish and frequent attempts of their enemies the Papists ; in testimony of thankfulness herein , and for the preserving and improving mutual love and charity among such as are sensible thereof , you are desired to meet many of the loyal Protestant nobility , gentry , clergy , and citizens , on Friday the 21st day of this instant April , 1682 , at ten of the clock , at St Michael 's Church , in Cornhill , there to hear a sermon , and from thence to go to Haberdashers ’ Hall , to dinner , and to bring this ticket with you . ”</p>
    <p n="142">A sermon was accordingly prepared for this great occasion ;<span corresp="#note445" type="note_anchor">[ 445 ]</span>and doubtless contained what is vulgarly called a touch of the times . All other preparations for this great entertainment were made with proper magnificence ; but the design was utterly quashed by the following proclamation :</p>
    <p n="143">“ Whitehall , April 19 . His Majesty was pleased , this afternoon , to make the following order in council , at the court of Whitehall , this 19th day of April , 1682 . By his Majesty , and the Lords of his Majesty 's most honourable privy council .</p>
    <p n="144">“ Whereas , the appointing of publique fasts and thanksgiving is matter of state , and belongs only to his majesty , by his prerogative , and his majesty being informed that , in the city of London , invitations have been made of great and unusual numbers , by printed tickets , one of which is hereunto annext ; his majesty looks upon the same as an insolent attempt , in manifest derogation of his right , and of dangerous consequence : The matter of the said invitation being of a publique nature , and the manner of carrying it on , tending to sedition , and raising distinctions and confederacies among his subjects , against the known laws and peace of the kingdom , his majesty , therefore , by the advice of his council , hath thought fit , and doth hereby strictly charge and command the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London , as they will answer the contrary at their peril , to take immediate and effectual care to prevent and hinder the said meeting , as an unlawful assembly ; and all sheriffs , constables , and others his majesty 's officers in the said city , are hereby commanded to be aiding and assisting therein . ”</p>
    <p n="145">This disappointment , trifling as it may seem , was of great disadvantage to the Whigs . It made them ridiculous ; which is more fatal to a political party than any other misfortune ; for few chuse to belong to the faction who have the laugh against them . The Tory poets exulted in the opportunity of showing their wit ; and we have perpetual allusions to this ludicrous incident , in the fugitive pieces of the time . Thus , Otway , in the prologue to the “ City Heiress , or Sir Timothy Treatall : ”</p>
    <p n="146">This dæmon lately drew in many a guest , To part with zealous guinny for no feast ; Who , but the most incorrigible fops , Forever doomed in dismal cells , called shops , To cheat and damn themselves to get their livings , Would lay sweet money out in sham thanksgivings ? Sham-plots you may have paid for o'er and o'er , But who e'er paid for a sham treat before ?</p>
    <p n="147">In a congratulatory poem on the Whigs entertainment , we have a similar strain of exultation , though , I believe , it is there ironical :</p>
    <p n="148">Hollow boys , hollow , hollow once again ! ‘ Tother half crown shall then reward your pain ; Alas ! poor Whigg , where wilt thou sneaking go , Thy wine is spilt , thy pyes and cakes are dough ; Down go the coppers , tables , shelves , and all , And so fare well to Haberdashers ’ Hall .</p>
    <p n="149">“ The Loyal Feast , appointed to be kept in Haberdashers ’ Hall , on Friday the 21st of April , 1682 , by his Majesty 's most loyal true-blue Protestant Subjects , and how it was defeated . ”</p>
    <p n="150">The Whigs from north to south , from east to west , Did all contribute to a loyal feast ; To this great work , a guiney was the least . They cleared the stalls of fish , flesh , fowl , and beast , Where Tony and brave Perkin was a guest ; But what succeeded this , made up the jest .</p>
    <p n="151">Tony was small , but of noble race , And was beloved of every one ; He broached his tap , and it ran apace , To make a solemn treat for all the town . He sent to yeoman , knight , and lord , The holy tribe to entertain , With all the nation could afford ; But Tony will never be himself again .</p>
    <p n="152">With thanks and prayers for our good king , They vowed to solemnize the day ; But royal Charles , he smoked the thing , And sent the rabble with a pox away . He sent his summons to the cit , Seditious meetings to refrain ; The feast was broke , and the guests were beshit , And Tony will never be himself again .</p>
    <p n="153">And now the capons fly about , With fricassees of amber grice , And chickens ready dressed , they shout About the street for pence apiece . The Whigs did wish the counsel choked , Who did this noble feast restrain ; All down in the mouth , to be thus bawked , Poor Tony will ne'er be himself again .</p>

    <p n="156">The Marquis of Worcester , Lord President of Wales , was a keen opponent of the Bill of Exclusion ; insomuch , that , by a vote of the Commons in 1680 , he was declared a favourer of Popery , ( then an imputation of tremendous import ,) and an address was appointed to be preferred against him , Halifax , Clarendon , and others , as enemies to the king and kingdom . It may be supposed , that this was far from lowering the marquis in the king 's esteem ; on the contrary , in 1682 , he was created Duke of Beaufort . At the Duke of Monmouth 's invasion he commanded in Bristol , and was an effectual means of stopping his progress ; for , when he approached that city , which contained many of his partisans , the Duke of Beaufort , finding there was great danger of an insurrection in the place , declared , that he would burn the town the instant he saw the slightest symptoms of disloyalty . When this was made known to Monmouth , he exclaimed , “ God forbid I should be the means of exposing so noble a city to the double calamity of sword and fire ! ” Accordingly , he instantly altered the direction of his march , leaving behind him that rich and populous city , which , if he could have carried it , contained men to increase his forces , stores to supply them , arms to equip them , and money to pay them . This proved a fatal indulgence of compassion :</p>
    <p n="157">“ Ambition should be made of sterner stuff . ”</p>
    <p n="158">The Duke of Beaufort continued to be a friend to James , after , by abdicating his throne , he had ceased to be a friend to himself . He voted against William in the Convention Parliament . Lord Herbert , of Ragland , the duke 's eldest son , in whom he “ saw all his glories copied , ” as the poet has it , was , according to Wood , entered at Christ Church , Oxford , and took the degree of Master of Arts in 1681 .</p>
    <p n="159">An account of the Duke of Beaufort 's noble house-keeping , and mode of educating his family , has been preserved by Roger North , and presents so curious a picture of the interior of a great family , in the end of the 17th century , that I think the reader will be pleased to see it :</p>
    <p n="160">“ One year his lordship , ( the Lord Chief Justice North , afterwards Lord Keeper Guilford ,) concluding at Bristol , made a visit at Badminton to the Duke of Beaufort , and staid about a week . For the duke was descended from a North of his lordship 's family , viz . one of the Lord Edward North 's daughters , whom a lineal ancestor of his Grace married . So , besides conformity of principle , with respect to the public , they were , by this relation , qualified for mutual respect and honour . I mention this entertainment as an handle of shewing a princely way of living , which that noble duke used , above any other , except crowned heads , that I have had notice of in Europe ; and , in some respects , greater than most of them , to whom he might have been an example . He had above L. 2000 per annum in his hands , which he managed by stewards , bailiffs , and servants ; and , of that , a great part of the country , which was his own , lying round about him , was part , and the husbandmen , &amp; c. were of his family , and provided for in his large expanded house . He bred all his horses , which came to the husbandry first colts , and , from thence , as they were fit , were taken into his equipage ; and , as by age , or accident , they grew unfit for that service , they were returned to the place from whence they came , and there expired ; except what , for plenty or unfitness , were sold or disposed of . He had about two hundred persons in his family , all provided for , and , in his capital house , nine original tables covered every day : and , for the accommodation of so many , a large hall was built , with a sort of alcove at one end , for distinction ; but yet the whole lay in the view of him that was chief , who had power to do what was proper for keeping order amongst them ; and it was his charge to see it done . The tables were properly assigned , as , for example , the chief steward with the gentlemen and pages ; the master of the horse with the coachmen and liveries ; an under steward with the bailiffs and some husbandmen ; the clerk of the kitchen with the bakers , brewers , &amp; c. all together ; and other more inferior people , under these , in places apart . The women had their dining-room also , and were distributed in like manner : my lady 's chief woman with the gentlewomen ; the housekeeper with the maids , and some others . The method of governing this great family was admirable and easy , and such as might have been a pattern for any management whatever ; for , if the Duke or Duchess ( who concerned herself much more than he did ; for every day of her life , in the morning , she took her tour , and visited every office about the house , and so was her own superintendant ) observed any thing amiss or suspicious , as a servant riding out , or the like , nothing was said to that servant , but his immediate superior , or one of an higher order , was sent for , who was to enquire and answer if leave had been given , or not ; if not , such servant was straight turned away . No fault of order was passed by ; for it may be concluded , there are enough of them that pass undiscovered . All the provisions of the family came from foreign parts , as merchandize . Soap and candle were made in the house , so likewise the malt was ground there ; and all the drink that came to the duke 's table , was of malt sun-dried upon the leads of his house . Those are large ; and the lanthorn is in the centre of an asterisk of glades , cut through the wood of all the country round , four or five in a quarter , almost a perte de vue . Diverse of the gentlemen cut their trees and hedges to humour his vistos ; and some planted their hills in his lines , for compliment , at their own charge . All the trees , planted in his parks and about , were fenced with a dry wall of stone , taken out where the tree was set . And with all this menagery and provision , no one , that comes and goes for visits , or affairs with the duke , ( who was lord-lieutenant of four or five counties , and Lord President of Wales ,) that could observe any thing more to do there than in any other nobleman 's house ; so little of vain ostentation was to be seen there . At the entrance where coaches ordinarily came in , the duke built a neat dwelling-house ; but pompous stables , which would accommodate forty horses , as well as the best stables he had . This was called the inn , and was contrived for the ease of the suitors , as I may call them ; for , instead of half-a-crown to his servants at taking horse , sixpence there , for form , served the turn ; and no servant of his came near a gentleman 's horse ; but they were brought by their own servants , except such as lodged , whose equipages were in his own stables .</p>
    <p n="161">“ As for the duke and duchess , and their friends , there was no time of the day without diversion . Breakfast in her gallery , that opened into the gardens ; then perhaps a deer was to be killed , or the gardens and parks , with the several sorts of deer , to be visited ; and if it required mounting , horses of the duke 's were brought for all the company . And so , in the afternoon , when the ladies were disposed to air , and the gentlemen with them , coaches and six came to hold them all . At half an hour after eleven , the bell rang to prayers , so at six in the evening ; and , through a gallery , the best company went into an aisle in the church , ( so near was it ,) and the duke and duchess could see if all the family were there . The ordinary pastime of the ladies was in a gallery on the other side , where she had diverse gentlewomen commonly at work upon embroidery and fringe-making ; for all the beds of state were made and finished in the house . The meats were very neat , and not gross ; no servants in livery attended , but those called gentlemen only ; and , in the several kinds , even down to the small beer , nothing could be more choice than the table was . It was an oblong and not an oval ; and the duchess , with two daughters only , sat at the upper end . If the gentlemen chose a glass of wine , the civil offers were made either to go down into the vaults , which were very large and sumptuous , or servants , at a sign given , attended with salvers , &amp; c. and many a brisk round went about ; but no sitting at table with tobacco and healths , as the too common use is . And this way of entertaining continued a week , while we were there , with incomparable variety : for the duke had always some new project , building , walling , or planting , which he would show , and ask his friends their advice about ; and nothing was forced or strained , but easy and familiar , as if it was , and really so I thought it to be , the common course and way of living in that family .</p>
    <p n="162">“ One thing more I must needs relate , which the duke told us smiling , and it was this : When he was in the midst of his building , his neighbour , the Lord Chief Justice Hales , made him a visit ; and observing the many contrivances the duke had for the disposing of so great a family , he craved leave to suggest one to him , which he thought would be much for his service , and it was , to have but one door to his house , and the window of his study , where he sat most , open upon that . This shows how hard it is for even wise and learned men to consider things without themselves . The children of the family were bred with a philosophical care . No inferior servants were permitted to entertain them , lest some mean sentiments , or foolish notions and fables , should steal into them ; and nothing was so strongly impressed upon them as a sense of honour . Witness the Lord Arthur , who , being about five years old , was very angry with the judge for hanging men . The judge told him , that , if they were not hanged , they would kill and steal . ‘ No , ’ said the little boy , ‘ you should make them promise upon their honour they will not do so , and then they will not . ’ It were well if this institutionary care of parents were always correspondent in the manners of all the children ; for it is not often found to prove so . ” Life of the Lord Keeper Guilford , p. 132 .</p>

    <p n="167">When Monmouth undertook his ill-fated expedition , Albemarle marched against him with the militia of Devon ; but the ex-chancellor of Cambridge baffled the attempts of his successor to coop him up at Lyme , and compelled him to retreat with some disorder . Monmouth , after assuming the title of king , sent a summons to Albemarle to claim his allegiance , who returned a cold and contemptuous answer . In 1687 , Albemarle was sent abroad as governor of Jamaica ; in which island he died .</p>

    <p n="170">Sir Henry Bennet was the constant attendant of Charles II . during his exile : after the Restoration , he became a member of the Cabal administration , and secretary of state . He was finally Lord Chamberlain , and through many turns of politics retained the favour of Charles II ., perhaps as much from making himself useful in his pleasures , as from the recollection of his faithful attachment . He was learned , and accustomed to business ; but , being naturally of a slow understanding , and having acquired a formal manner during his stay in Spain , much enhanced by a black patch which he wore to conceal a wound on his nose , there was something ridiculously stiff in his demeanour . Charles II ., who put no value upon a friend in comparison to a jest , is said to have had much delight in seeing the Duke of Buckingham , or any of his gay courtiers , by the help of a black patch and a white staff , enact Harry Bennet . Mulgrave thinks , that a ludicrous idea being thus associated with Arlington , and all that concerned him , he came to be generally thought a man of less abilities , than he really was . He adds , he was of a generous temper , and served his friends warmly . Being once ungratefully used by one whom he had benefited , he asked Mulgrave , what effect he thought it would have upon him ; and prevented his answer , by saying , it should neither cool his present friendship , nor prevent him of the greatest happiness of his life , which was to serve the first deserving person that fell in his way .<span corresp="#note448" type="note_anchor">[ 448 ]</span>Although the Duke of York disliked Arlington , yet he suffered him to retain his situation at court .

    <p n="173">Lady Isabella Bennet , only daughter and heiress of the Earl of Arlington , was married to Henry Fitzroy , Duke of Grafton , second son of Charles II . by the Duchess of Cleveland . This match was against the inclination of the duke 's mother ; for Derrick says , he saw a letter from her to Danby , dated at Paris , in 1675 , thanking him for endeavouring to prevent the match . The Duke of Grafton was bred to the sea . After Monmouth had taken the popular courses which we have reviewed , the king endeavoured to set Grafton , though inferior in all personal accomplishments , in opposition to him , in the hearts of the people . He was appointed steward of the Loyal Apprentices ’ entertainment ,<span corresp="#note450" type="note_anchor">[ 450 ]</span>and otherwise placed in the public eye , as the rival of Monmouth . He also was admitted to share his more profitable spoils , getting one of the regiments of the guards , formerly under Monmouth 's command , when the Duke of Richmond was made Master of the Horse .<span corresp="#note451" type="note_anchor">[ 451 ]</span>Grafton was sent against Monmouth on his landing in the west , and attempted to beat up his rear with a body of horse , as he marched towards Frome ; but was defeated , and very nearly made prisoner .<span corresp="#note452" type="note_anchor">[ 452 ]</span>The Duke of Grafton participated in the general discontent which James II 's measures excited through the kingdom , and remonstrated against them with professional frankness . The king ridiculed a seaman 's pretensions to tenderness of conscience ; and Grafton answered sturdily , that “ if he had not much religion himself , he belonged to a party who had . ” He was with the king when he headed his army to march against the Prince of Orange , and joined with Churchill , in exhorting him to hazard a battle . We must hope , that they meant to share the risque which they recommended ; and that it was only a consciousness that the king had deserted his own cause , which induced them to go over to the prince , when their counsel was rejected . On the 28th September , 1690 , the Duke of Grafton was mortally wounded at the siege of Cork , as he commanded the squadron which covered the landing . He seems to have been a brave , rough , hardy-tempered man , and would probably have made a figure as a naval officer .</p>

    <p n="176">Lewis Duras , Earl of Feversham , brother of the French Marshals Duras and De Lorge , and nephew to the famous Marshal Turenne . He was born of a Huguenot family , and retained his religion , or the form of it , when both his brothers conformed to the Catholic church . The Duke of York 's opportune return from Flanders is said , by Sir John Reresby , to have been planned by this nobleman ; who is , therefore , introduced here with singular propriety . He is said to have been brave ; but appears , from the only remarkable action in which he was ever engaged , to have been a bad general , and a cruel man . James II ., who had a high esteem for Feversham , placed him at the head of that body of disciplined troops , which checked the career of Monmouth . He advanced to Bridgewater , of which Monmouth had got possession , with some of the finest regiments in the service , and 30 field pieces . The unfortunate adventurer seemed to have no refuge left , but to disperse his forces , and fly for his safety ; when the mode in which Feversham conducted himself gave him a fair chance for victory and a crown . He encamped in the open country , three miles from the enemy , with only a dry ditch in his front ; dispersed his cavalry in the neighbouring hamlets , and retired quietly to bed , without either sending out reconnoitering parties , or establishing advanced posts .<span corresp="#note453" type="note_anchor">[ 453 ]</span>It is no wonder , that , that in such a careless state , he should have been completely surprised ; it is only singular , that , even allowing for the cowardice of Lord Grey , who fled , instead of performing the safe and easy duty committed to him of firing the horse-quarters of Feversham 's army , he should have been able to recover the consequences of his negligence . Monmouth 's men fought for three hours after they had been deserted by their cavalry , with the innate courage of English peasants . Feversham was still hard pressed , notwithstanding the gallant assistance afforded him by Dumbarton ; when the Bishop of Bath and Wells decided the day , by causing the artillery to be turned upon the flank of Monmouth 's followers . When they had given way , Feversham exhibited more of the cold-blooded cruelty of his country , than he had done of their genius and fiery valour , while the battle lasted . The military bishop also proved himself a better lawyer than the general , as he had shewn himself in the fight a better soldier ; but it was not till a warm expostulation was made on his part that the general ceased to execute the prisoners by martial law , and reserved them to a still more cruel fate from the forms of law , as administered by the brutal Jefferies . Neither Feversham 's blunders , nor his brutality , seemed to lessen his merit in the eye of his sovereign . He received the order of the Garter , on the 31st July , 1685 , probably on the vacancy occasioned by the Duke of Monmouth 's death , whose memory was on this occasion treated with signal ignominy .<span corresp="#note454" type="note_anchor">[ 454 ]</span>At the time of the Revolution , Lord Feversham was commander in chief , and proved himself incapable of taking any spirited steps for James 's interest ; for the army he commanded , though the officers were disaffected , would probably have fought , had they been once fairly committed in opposition to the Dutch . When the king resolved to abandon everything , and forsake his kingdom , he left behind , a letter to Feversham , stating that he should not expect his troops at present to expose themselves . The general might have secured a part of his forces , by retreating along with the high-spirited Viscount of Dundee , who marched back into Scotland with the Scottish regiments ; but Feversham was a man of another mould , and rather chose to augment the general confusion , by disbanding the army . When James was detected by the fishermen of Kent , in his attempt to leave the kingdom , Feversham , with a party of his guards , was sent to conduct him back to his capital . James also chose him for the messenger , when , yielding to sad necessity , he sent a letter to the Prince of Orange , inviting him to St James 's . With a view , doubtless , to increase the terror of the king 's mind , and precipitate his intention of a second flight , the prince arrested the bearer of this humiliating embassy . This was the last public occasion on which James had occasion to employ the services of the unmilitary nephew of the great Turenne , whose name is connected with the most blame-worthy and most melancholy passages of his reign .</p>

    <p n="179">These lines , which sufficiently vouch their author to have been Tate , refer to Sir Heneage a Finch , an eminent lawyer , who was first attorney-general , and , upon Shaftesbury losing his seals , succeeded him as Lord Keeper . He was a most incorruptible judge , and could not be swayed in his decisions even by the king 's interference , which upon all political occasions was omnipotent with him . He was a good lawyer , and a ready orator ; but upon this last accomplishment , he set , as all lawyers do , rather too high a value : for they , whose profession necessarily leads them often to speak against their own opinion , and often to make much of trifles , are apt to lose , in the ingenuity of their arguments , the power of making a real impression upon the bosom of their hearers . North says , that the business , rather than the justice , of the court , flourished exceedingly under Finch ; for he was a formalist , and took exceeding pleasure in encouraging and listening to nice distinctions of law , instead of taking a broad view of the equity of each case . He was a steady and active supporter of the Tory party on all occasions ; in reward of which , he was created Earl of Nottingham . After a long and lingering disease , which terminated in a deep depression of spirits , this great lawyer died in 1682 , and was succeeded by Lord Guilford , as Lord Keeper .</p>

    <p n="182">Sir Roger L'Estrange was descended of a good family in Norfolk , and during the civil war was in arms for the king .<span corresp="#note455" type="note_anchor">[ 455 ]</span>Being taken prisoner by the parliament , he was condemned to die , but found means to obtain a pardon . He was a good performer on the violin ; a quality which recommended him to Cromwell , under whose government he lived , if we may trust one of his antagonists , in ease and affluence ; a circumstance with which he was afterwards as often reproached as our author with his panegyric on the Protector . The instant , however , that the restoration of monarchy approached , L'Estrange was among the first to hail it , and stepped forth to answer a pamphlet of Milton , on the subject of a republic , by a retort , which he irreverently entitled , “ No Blind Guides . ” After the Restoration , he was the great champion of the court , the high church , and the Tory party . His principal vehicle of political instruction was the “ Observator , ” a paper published twice a week ; but he also edited another , called “ Heraclitus Ridens ; ” and , independently of both , published answers , replies , rebutters , and sur-rebutters , to every attack made upon him , besides quires of pamphlets on all popular subjects . For these good services , he was knighted by King James . His style is in the last degree mean , crabbed , and low ; yet he possesses some power of argument and sarcasm . He appears to have first invented , or at least first practised to a great extent , the foolish custom of printing emphatic passages in a different type from the rest of the page , and thereby too often effecting a point , which the reader is unable to trace . For the other deeds of L'Estrange , and his numerous bead-roll of fugitive pieces , the reader may consult the article in the Biographia .</p>

    <p n="185">The Duke of York , after a short visit to England , returned to Scotland by sea . The vessel unfortunately struck upon a bank , called the Lemman Ore ; and the duke , with a few attendants , who crowded into the barge , were all who escaped from the wreck . Burnet says , that the duke showed no anxiety about the safety of any one save his dogs and his priests , whom the bishop maliciously classes together . Others say , he was principally interested about Churchill , who , at the Revolution , requited his anxiety but indifferently . The Gazette says , that when the barge put off , the poor sailors , who remained to perish , manned the sides in the usual honorary form , and , indifferent to their own fate , hailed the duke 's safety with three cheers ; a circumstance alluded to a few lines below , where it is said , the sufferers ,</p>

    <p n="197">Sir John Moor , the tory Lord Mayor , an aged and respectable citizen , of a mild character , and even hesitating and cautious in forming his measures , though sufficiently determined when once satisfied of their propriety . “ Which character , ” says North , “ was cut out for this time and public occasion ; for nothing but such firmness of mind , and manifest goodness , with a seeming passive disposition , could have protected from those rages of violence , as very often threatened him , and which , probably , had broke loose on any one in his post , that had carried matters with a stern and minatory behaviour . "[ 456 ] He was proposed by the court-party in the city for Lord Mayor , and , being scarcely opposed by the other faction , easily carried his election . The Whigs were led into this blunder , by mistaking the principles , and under-rating the resolution , of the candidate . Sir John Moor had been bred a non-conformist ; and , though he had taken the test with a view to civic honours , that was no more than had been done by Bethel , Cornish , and others , who retained in full vigour their sectarian principles . Besides , from the gentleness and softness of the new Lord Mayor 's demeanour , his smooth and diffident way of talking in private , and his embarrassed elocution in public , they conceived that , even if completely gained by the court , he would prove too passive and timorous , to serve them essentially against active and energetic opponents . In both these particulars they were woefully mistaken . Sir John proved to be most keenly disposed to second all the court measures ; and he was kept up to the pitch of resolution necessary for carrying them through , by the constant support , encouragement , and advice of the Duke of Ormond , whom the court employed to back him , and who , during the contests which followed , dined with the Lord Mayor two or three times every week .<span corresp="#note457" type="note_anchor">[ 457 ]</span>This election , and its consequences , was a severe blow to the fanatical interest in the city ; the jovial custom of banquets and feasting was revived ; and the musicians , who had been long under restraint , were restored to their privilege , which they employed in chaunting forth the praises of Sir John the Restorer .<span corresp="#note458" type="note_anchor">[ 458 ]</span>More , of Morehall , was not for a time more celebrated in song , than the Lord Mayor , his namesake ; and a general revolution appeared to have taken place in the manners , as well as the principles , of the citizens , which , under the Whig government , had savoured not a little of the ancient days of fanatical severity .</p>

    <p n="200">Ziph and Shimei were the Whig sheriffs in 1681 ; concerning whom , see note upon Shimei in Part First . The viler pair were Thomas Pilkington , and Samuel Shute , who followed out the practice of their predecessors , in the mode of packing the juries on political trials , and had the honour to arrange that which acquitted the Earl of Shaftesbury . They were much hated by the court ; and , when they came with the recorder to invite the King to dine with the Lord Mayor , Charles forgot his usual politeness so far , as to answer sternly , “ so agreeable was the city 's invitation , that he would accept it , though brought by messengers so unwelcome to him as these two sheriffs . "[ 464 ] Sir John Moor had a most violent contest with these two persons , concerning the election of sheriffs for the ensuing year , about which the court were exceedingly anxious .</p>
    <p n="201">It had been customary , when these elections were matters of little consequence , that the Lord Mayor designated a citizen to hold the office of sheriff , by the ceremony of drinking to him , and sending him the cup . It was agreed by the court , that this custom should be revived , as throwing the choice of one of the sheriffs into the hands of their partizan , Sir John Moor . This being settled , the Mayor , in full form , drank to Dudley North , brother of the Lord Keeper Guilford , a Levant merchant , who accepted of that expensive office , to please his brother , and to serve the court . The popular party determined to controvert this election ; denying that a sheriff could be elected otherwise than by the Livery , and proposed Papillon and Dubois , sturdy Whigs , for their candidates . The court , on the other hand , contending that North was duly and incontrovertibly elected , by the jolly mode already mentioned , proposed a Mr Box for the other sheriff , whose office only they allowed to be vacant . The Common Hall , held on this occasion , was as tumultuary as a raging tempest . At length the Lord Mayor , with the party who denied there were two vacancies , withdrew ; while the country party remained , and polled for Papillon and Dubois , under the direction of Shute and Pilkington , the last year 's sheriffs . The court , affecting to consider this as a riot , interfered on that pretext , and a warrant was granted for committing the sheriffs to the Tower . Having found bail to answer for a misdemeanour , they returned to the charge with the same ardour as ever , and were actually about to complete their poll , when the hall was adjourned by the orders of the Lord Mayor . The whole weight of the court was necessary to keep up the Lord Mayor 's heart at this crisis . He was sent for to the Privy Council , encouraged , soothed , schooled , and finally assured , by a writing under the Lord Keeper 's hand , that he might adjourn the Common Hall , &amp; c. as he thought proper . Thus heartened , the Lord Mayor assumed to himself the whole management of the poll , although the sheriffs opened books for another , and , denying the legality of any election , excepting his own , declared Box duly returned . This citizen , however , apprehensive of the consequences of acting under so dubious a nomination , fined off , and declined to serve . One Rich was found , with more zeal and courage ; and , during the tumult of a Common Hall , which resounded with the cries of “ no election , ” &amp; c. this gentleman was elected sheriff by a few of the Lord Mayor 's partizans , and declared duly returned by the Lord Mayor , who immediately proceeded to dissolve the Common Hall . North and Rich were accordingly sworn in as sheriffs for the year ; but a guard of the Train Bands was necessary to protect them , while they thus qualified themselves for entering on their office .</p>
    <p n="202">This contest was followed by another , for the office of Lord Mayor . Gould , the popular candidate , was returned by a considerable majority ; but , upon a scrutiny , the court-party , by dint of real or pretended disqualifications , gained such an advantage , that Pritchard , their candidate , was returned by a majority of fourteen voices .</p>
    <p n="203">The importance of these elections was soon visible . The popular party were utterly disheartened , and their leaders exposed to the same practices from packing juries , which they had themselves employed . The court used their victory remorselessly . Pilkington , the ex-sheriff , was found liable in 100 , 000l . damages , for having said that “ the Duke of York had fired the city , and was now come to cut all their throats . ” Those concerned in carrying on the double poll , were severely fined , as guilty of a riot . Sir Patience Ward , an alderman of the popular party , was declared obnoxious to a charge of perjury , for an inconsistence in his evidence on Pilkington 's trial .<span corresp="#note465" type="note_anchor">[ 465 ]</span>In short , the royal vengeance was felt by all who had been active in opposition to the court .</p>
    <p n="204">But the extent of the court 's victory was best evinced by the conduct of Shaftesbury ; who , seeing his strong-hold , the magistracy of the city , thus invaded , and occupied by his enemies , fled from his house in Aldersgate-street , and for some time lay concealed in Wapping , trusting for his safety to the very lowest of mankind . From this hiding place , he sent forth messages to the other heads of the party , in which he urged the most desperate measures . But , finding it impossible to combine the various persons concerned in one plan of enterprize , and sensible of the danger of discovery , which each day 's delay rendered more imminent , after a bitter contest between fear and rage , he fled to Amsterdam . His retreat was followed by the trial of the conspirators in the Rye-house Plot ; and doubtless , the court , on that occasion , knew well how to avail themselves of the power of selecting juries so long possessed by their enemies , and now in their own hands . During the short remainder of this reign , the king 's authority was paramount and supreme ; his enemies were at his feet , and not a whisper of opposition disturbed his repose ;— a deceitful and delusive calm , which his unfortunate successor soon saw changed into a tempest .</p>

    <p n="239">THE MEDAL .</p>
    <p n="240">A SATIRE AGAINST SEDITION .</p>
    <p n="241">Per Graium populos , mediqæue per Elidis urbem Ibat ovans ; Divumque sibi poscebat honores .</p>
    <p n="242">THE MEDAL .</p>
    <p n="243">The Medal was published in the beginning of March 1682 , about four months after the appearance of the first part of “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” and eight months before the publication of the second part of that poem . The circumstances , which led to it , require us to notice Shaftesbury 's imprisonment and acquittal .</p>
    <p n="244">On the 2d July , 1681 , the Earl of Shaftesbury was apprehended , by virtue of a warrant from council , and after his papers had been seized , and he himself had undergone an examination , was committed to the Tower . Upon the 24th November , 1681 , a bill for high-treason was presented against him to the grand jury of Middlesex . When the witnesses were adduced , the jurors demanded , that they might be examined in private ; and Pilkington , the Whig sheriff , required , that they should be examined separately . Both requests were refused by the court . One Booth was then examined , who swore , that Lord Shaftesbury had told him , he intended to carry down to the Oxford parliament a party of fifty gentlemen , and their servants , armed and mounted , to be commanded by a Captain Wilkinson ; and that his Lordship stated this force to be provided , for the purpose of repelling any attack which the king 's guards might make on the parliament , and , if necessary , to take the king from his bad advisers by force , and bring him to the city of London . The witness , said he , was invited by Wilkinson to be one of this band , and provided himself with a good horse and arms for the service ; which was prevented by the sudden dissolution of the Oxford parliament . Seven other witnesses , Smith , Turberville , Haynes , and three persons called Macnamara , swore , that Shaftesbury had used to them , and each of them individually , the most treasonable expressions concerning the king 's person ; had declared he had no more title to the crown than the Duke of Buckingham ; that he deserved to be deposed ; and that he , Shaftesbury , would dethrone him , and convert the kingdom into a commonwealth . Here was enough of swearing at least to make a true bill . But the character of the witnesses was infamous ; Booth was a swindler , and could never give an account of the stable in which he kept his pretended charger , or produce any one who had seen it . Smith , by his own confession , had changed his religion twice , was one of the evidences of the Popish plot , and intimate with the villain Oates . Turberville stood in the same predicament of an infamous fellow , and an evidence for the plot ; he is said to have apologised for his apostacy , by saying plainly , that “ the Protestant citizens had forsaken him , and , God damn him , he would not starve . ” The other witnesses were Irishmen , and there was something remarkable in their history . They had pretended to discover a Catholic plot in Ireland , which , if one had existed any where , was doubtless the place where it might have been found . Their evidence , however , contained pretty much such a raw-head and bloody-bones story as that of Oates , and equally unworthy of credit . Yet Shaftesbury constituted himself their protector , and had them brought over to England , where he doubtless intended , that their Irish plot should be as warmly agitated in the Oxford parliament , as the English conspiracy in that of 1679 . Macnamara 's “ Narrative of the Conspiracy ” is dedicated to his Lordship , because it was not only known to the dedicator , “ but to the whole Christian world , how conspicuous his Lordship had been for his indefatigable zeal and vigilance over the safety of his majesty 's most sacred person , and the welfare of the whole extent of his dominions . ” The sudden dissolution of the Oxford parliament , which had such important consequences in various respects , prevented the prosecution of the Irish plot . Besides , it seems to have escaped even Shaftesbury , that popular terror , the most powerful of engines , loses its excitability by too frequent alarms . The theme of a plot began to be listened to with indifference . That of Ireland fell to the ground , without exciting clamour or terror , but the witnesses remained . There is a story of some Irish recruits , who , being detected in a brawl , justified themselves , by saying , they were paid by the king for fighting , and it was quite the same to them where they fought , or with whom . The witnesses were equally sedulous in their vocation , and equally indifferent about the application of their labours ; for , finding the court had obtained an ascendency , they readily turned with the tide , and bore evidence , as we have seen , against their original protector and encourager . The Tories basely availed themselves of the readiness with which this hungry pack of bloodhounds turned against their huntsman , and triumphantly claimed for them the same credit which the Whigs had demanded in former cases ; although they must have been conscious , that they were employing the worst arts , as well as the most infamous implements , of their enemies . Besides the infamy of these men 's character , their story was very improbable ; as it could hardly be supposed , that Shaftesbury , the veteran leader of a party , should have committed himself so deeply in unnecessary and unreserved communication with these vulgar banditti , or expressed himself against the king in such low and gross language as they imputed to him .</p>
    <p n="245">Such being the oral testimony , and such its defects , the crown lawyers endeavoured to aid it , by founding upon certain papers found in Shaftesbury 's study . One of these contained the names of the principal persons in the nation , divided into two lists , one titled , Worthy Men , and the other , Men Worthy ; which last contained the principal Tories , and the legend was understood to mean , “ men worthy to be hanged . ” This was too enigmatical to bear much argument . But there was also found a draught of an association against Popery , in which many dangerous topics were stated . It was thereby declared , that the Papist Plot was still advancing , and that the Catholics had been highly encouraged by James Duke of York ; that mercenary forces had been levied , and kept on foot , contrary to law , and to the danger of the king 's person : Therefore the persons associating were to bind themselves to defend , first the Protestant religion , and then the king 's person and liberties of the subject , against all encroachment and usurpation of arbitrary power , and to endeavour to disband all such mercenary forces as were kept up in and about the city of London , to the great amazement and terror of all the good people of the land ; also , never to consent that the Duke of York , or any professed Papist , should succeed to the crown , but by all lawful means , and by force of arms if necessary , to resist and oppose his so doing . By a still more formidable clause , it was provided , that the subscribers were to receive orders from the parliament if sitting ; but if it should be dissolved , from the majority of the association itself . Lastly , that no one should separate from the rest of the association , on pain of being by the others prosecuted and suppressed , as a perjured person and public enemy . Much dangerous , and even treasonable , inference may be drawn from this model . But it was only an unsigned scroll , and did not appear to have been framed , or even revised and approved of , by Shaftesbury .</p>
    <p n="246">With such evidence against him , Shaftesbury might have gone safely before a jury of indifferent men , could such have been found . But the Whig sheriffs , Shute and Pilkington , left nothing to hazard , and took good care the assize should consist of men picked out of the very centre of their own party . We recognize the names of Godfrey , brother to Sir Edmondbury ; of Papillon and Dubois , the Whig candidates for the shrievalty against North and Rich ; of Sir Samuel Barnardiston , who maintained a furious action against the high-sheriff of Suffolk , for a double return ; of Shepherd , the wine-merchant , at whose house the Duke of Monmouth , Lord Russel , &amp; c. afterwards held their meetings ; of Edwin , the presbyterian , and others less noted in history , but not less remarkable at the time for the violence of their party-zeal . After a short consideration , they returned the bill Ignoramus ; upon which there was a shout of continued applause in the court , which lasted for an hour , and the city , in the evening , blazed with bonfires , to celebrate the escape of their Protestant leader . Such was the history of this noted trial , which took place at a time when the course of law had lost its deep still channel , and all causes were carried by a fierce impetuous torrent , which threatened to break down the banks , and become a general inundation . Accustomed to a pure administration of justice , we now look back with disgust and horror upon times , when , to bring in a just verdict , it was necessary to assemble a packed jury .</p>
    <p n="247">The triumph of the Whigs was unbounded ; and , among other symptoms of exultation , it displayed itself in that which gave rise to this poem of Dryden . This was a medal of Lord Shaftesbury , struck by William Bower , an artist , who had executed some popular pieces allusive to the Roman Catholic plot .<span corresp="#note466" type="note_anchor">[ 466 ]</span>The obverse presented the bust of the earl , with the legend , ANTONIO COMITI DE SHAFTESBURY ; the reverse , a view of London , the bridge , and the Tower ; the sun is rising above the Tower , and just in the act of dispersing a cloud ; the legend around the exergue is LÆTAMUR , and beneath is the date of his acquittal , 24th NOVEMBER , 1681 . The partizans of the acquitted patriot wore these medals at their breasts ; and care was taken that this emblem should be made as general as possible .<span corresp="#note467" type="note_anchor">[ 467 ]</span></p>
    <p n="248">The success of “ Absalom and Achitophel ” made the Tories look to our author as the only poet whose satire might check , or ridicule , the popular triumph of Shaftesbury . If the following anecdote , which Spence has given on the authority of a Catholic priest , a friend of Pope , be absolutely correct , Charles himself engaged Dryden to write on this theme . “ One day as the king was walking in the Mall , and talking with Dryden , he said , ‘ If I was a poet , and I think I am poor enough to be one , I would write a poem on such a subject , in the following manner . ’ He then gave him the plan of “ The Medal . ” Dryden took the hint , carried the poem , as soon as it was written , to the king , and had a present of a hundred broad pieces for it . ”</p>
    <p n="249">The merits of “ The Medal , ” as a satirical poem , are universally acknowledged ; nor does it greatly suffer from being placed , as the subject naturally invites , in comparison with “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” The latter , as a group of figures , presents greater scope and variety , and may be therefore more generally interesting than the portrait of an individual ; but it does not more fully display the abilities of the artist . Nothing can be more forcibly described , than the whole of Shaftesbury 's political career ; and , to use the nervous language of Johnson , “ the picture of a man , whose propensions to mischief are such , that his best actions are but inability of wickedness , is very skilfully delineated , and strongly coloured . ” The comparison of his best and most politic councils , to the cures affected by those called white witches , whom it was unlawful to consult , because , even in accomplishing innocent purposes , they used infernal arts , is poignantly severe . The succeeding lines , in which the poet ridicules bitterly that appeal to the people , which the demagogues of that , as of all periods , were desirous to represent as the criterion of truth , contains the essence of all that an hundred philosophers can say upon the topic . His stern and indignant picture of the citizens of London , unjust as it is , if meant to express their general character , is , in individual instances , too often verified . That looseness which habitual chicane in trade introduces into mercantile morality ; that bustling activity , which , however meritorious when within its sphere , is so apt to extend itself where its exertion is only mischievous and absurd ; and that natural turn to democracy , which arises from frequenting popular meetings and from ambition of civic honours ; that half-acquaintance with the affairs of other countries , and half-intimacy with the laws of our own , acquired in the course of mercantile transactions ,— all combine , but too often , to turn an useful sober citizen , into a meddling , pragmatical , opinionative politician . The strong and gloomy picture of the fanatics , which succeeds , describes a race of men now in a great measure extinct , of whom the influence , though declining , even in the poet 's time , continued to be powerful , and which had , in the preceding generation , prostrated before them both the mitre and the throne . The comparison of the fanatical ideas of religion entertained by these dissenting teachers , with the supposed principles of the libertine and latitudinarian Shaftesbury , gave scope for some nervous satire , and led the author naturally to consider the probable result of the schemes of these incongruous allies . These he predicts , according to the progress of things after the great civil war , to be successively the dominion of presbytery , and depression of the gentry ; the insurrection of the independents , and other sects , against their spiritual tyranny ; quarrels between the civil and military leaders ; the commons destroying the peerage ; a democratical republic ; a military tyranny ; and , by the blessing of heaven , a restoration of the rightful heir . All these scenes had already passed at no distant period ; and now , while the sword was yet in the sheath , though the hand was upon its hilt , the masterly and energetic language in which they are detailed may have tempted many to pause and think , whether the evils , of which they complained , deserved the risque of so desperate a remedy .</p>
    <p n="250">Such is the plan of this admirable poem . The language is as striking as the ideas and subject . The illustrations and images are short and apposite , such as give force to the argument , and flow easily into the diction , without appearing to have been laboured , or brought from a distance . I fear , however , some of the scriptural allusions are censurable , as too free , if not profane . The verse has all the commanding emphasis , with which Dryden , beyond any other poet , knew how to body forth and adorn his poetical arguments . One Alexandrine is prolonged two syllables beyond the usual length ; a circumstance hardly worth notice , were it not to show the sharp-sighted malice of Dryden 's enemies , who could discover this single inaccuracy , if , indeed , the licence was not intentional , amid so much sounding versification .<span corresp="#note468" type="note_anchor">[ 468 ]</span></p>
    <p n="251">As “ The Medal ” attracted immediate and extensive attention , the Whig champions stepped forth to the contest . “ The Mushroom , ” by Edmund Hickeringell , first appeared ; and , in succession , “ The Medal Reversed , ” by Samuel Pordage , which procured its author a couplet in the second part of “ Absalom and Achitophel ; ” “ The Loyal Medal Vindicated , ” and the “ Medal of John Bayes ; ” all of which , and perhaps many more , appeared in the summer and autumn of 1681 . Two satires , of a more general nature , entitled , “ Dryden 's Satire to his Muse , ” and , “ The Tory Poets , ” were also published against our author in the course of that year ; a sufficient proof of the irritation of that party , whose chief he had now twice held up to public detestation .— The popularity of “ The Medal ” did not cease with the crisis which gave it birth ; it went through many editions , and only became less known , when successive changes had totally worn away all remembrance of the intrigues of the eminent politician against whom it was directed . Johnson has said , “ It is now not much read , nor perhaps generally understood ; yet , a slight acquaintance with the history of the period removes all obscurity ; and , though we cannot sympathize with the fervour of politics which it contains , the poetry has claims to popularity , widely independent of the temporary nature of the subject . ”</p>
    <p n="252">As the reader is now to take a long farewell of Lord Shaftesbury , it may not be unnecessary to remind him , that , when freed from the accusation of high treason , the earl continued to agitate plans of opposition to the government , which became more and more violent , as the ascendency of the court became more powerful , until open force seemed to be the only means left of accomplishing what undoubtedly he had at first hoped to carry through by political intrigue . At length he found it necessary to fly from his house in Aldersgate-Street , and take refuge in the suburbs of the city , from whence he sent messages to his associates , urging them to take arms . But he was now doomed to experience what his ardent temper had before prevented him from considering . When they came to the crisis , the different views and dispositions of the allies began to discover themselves . Russell limited his wishes to security for liberty ; Monmouth stipulated his own succession on Charles ’ death ; Sidney demanded a free commonwealth ; and all dreaded Shaftesbury , who , they were sensible , was determined to be at the head of the kind of government adopted , whatever that might be . Nor were their tempers less discordant than their plans . While an inferior order of conspirators were organizing plans for assassinating the whole royal family , Monmouth was anxious for the life of his father , Russell averse to shedding the blood of his countrymen , Grey , Howard , and Trenchard , from meaner motives , unwilling to encounter the dangers of war . After a desperate threat to commence the rising , and make the honour and danger all his own , Shaftesbury at length fled to Holland , where he landed in November 1682 . The magistrates of Amsterdam gave him welcome , and enrolled him among their citizens , to evade any claim by the court of England on his person ; yet they failed not to remind him of his former declaration , of Delenda est Carthago , accompanying the freedom which they presented to him with these words : Ab nostra Carthagine , nondum deleta , salutem accipe . Here , while pondering the consequences of former intrigues , and perhaps adjusting new machinations , Shaftesbury was seized with the gout in his stomach , and expired on the 21st January , 1682-3 .</p>
    <p n="253">To sift the character of this extraordinary man , and divide his virtues from his vices , his follies from his talents , would be a difficult , perhaps an impossible task .

    <p n="267">EPISTLE</p>
    <p n="268">TO</p>
    <p n="269">THE WHIGS .</p>
    <p n="270">For to whom can I dedicate this poem with so much justice as to you ? ‘ Tis the representation of your own hero ; ‘ tis the picture drawn at length , which you admire and prize so much in little . None of your ornaments are wanting ; neither the landscape of your Tower , nor the rising sun , nor the anno domini of your new sovereign 's coronation . This must needs be a grateful undertaking to your whole party ; especially to those who have not been so happy as to purchase the original . I hear the graver has made a good market of it ; all his kings are bought up already , or the value of the remainder so enhanced , that many a poor Polander ,<span corresp="#note470" type="note_anchor">[ 470 ]</span>who would be glad to worship the image , is not able to go to the cost of him , but must be content to see him here . I must confess I am no great artist ; but sign-post painting will serve the turn to remember a friend by , especially when better is not to be had . Yet , for your comfort , the lineaments are true ; and though he sat not five times to me , as he did to B ,<span corresp="#note471" type="note_anchor">[ 471 ]</span>yet I have consulted history ; as the Italian painters do , when they would draw a Nero or a Caligula : though they have not seen the man , they can help their imagination by a statue of him , and find out the colouring from Suetonius and Tacitus . Truth is , you might have spared one side of your medal ; the head would be seen to more advantage if it were placed on a spike of the Tower , a little nearer to the sun , which would then break out to better purpose .<span corresp="#note472" type="note_anchor">[ 472 ]</span></p>
    <p n="271">You tell us , in your preface to the “ No-protestant Plot ,"[ 473 ] that you shall be forced hereafter to leave off your modesty ; I suppose you mean that little which is left you , for it was worn to rags when you put out this medal . Never was there practised such a piece of notorious impudence in the face of an established government . I believe , when he is dead , you will wear him in thumb-rings , as the Turks did Scanderbeg , as if there were virtue in his bones to preserve you against monarchy . Yet all this while you pretend not only zeal for the public good , but a due veneration for the person of the king . But all men , who can see an inch before them , may easily detect those gross fallacies . That it is necessary for men in your circumstances to pretend both , is granted you ; for without them there could be no ground to raise a faction . But I would ask you one civil question , what right has any man among you , or any association of men , to come nearer to you , who , out of parliament , cannot be considered in a public capacity , to meet , as you daily do , in factious clubs , to vilify the government in your discourses , and to libel it in all your writings ? Who made you judges in Israel ? Or how is it consistent with your zeal for the public welfare , to promote sedition ? Does your definition of loyal , which is , “ to serve the king according to the laws , ” allow you the licence of traducing the executive power with which you own he is invested ? You complain that his majesty has lost the love and confidence of his people ; and by your very urging it , you endeavour what in you lies to make him lose them . All good subjects abhor the thought of arbitrary power , whether it be in one or many : if you were the patriots you would seem , you would not at this rate incense the multitude to assume it ; for no sober man can fear it , either from the king 's disposition , or his practice ; or even where you would odiously lay it , from his ministers . Give us leave to enjoy the government and benefit of laws under which we were born , and which we desire to transmit to our posterity . You are not the trustees of the public liberty : and if you have not right to petition in a crowd ,<span corresp="#note474" type="note_anchor">[ 474 ]</span>much less have you to intermeddle in the management of affairs , or to arraign what you do not like ; which , in effect , is every thing that is done by the king and council . Can you imagine , that any reasonable man will believe you respect the person of his majesty , when it is apparent that your seditious pamphlets are stuffed with particular reflections on him ? If you have the confidence to deny this , it is easy to be evinced from a thousand passages , which I only forbear to quote , because I desire they should die and be forgotten . I have perused many of your papers ; and to show you that I have , the third part of your “ No-protestant Plot ” is much of it stolen from your dead author 's pamphlet , called the “ Growth of Popery ;"[ 475 ] as manifestly as Milton 's “ Defence of the English People ” is from Buchanan , “ De jure regni apud Scotos : ” or your first Covenant , and new Association , from the Holy League of the French Guisards .<span corresp="#note476" type="note_anchor">[ 476 ]</span>Any one , who reads Davila , may trace your practices all along . There were the same pretences for reformation and loyalty , the same aspersions of the king , and the same grounds of a rebellion . I know not whether you will take the historian 's word , who says it was reported , that Poltrot , a Huguenot , murdered Francis Duke of Guise , by the instigations of Theodore Beza , or that it was a Huguenot minister , otherwise called a Presbyterian , ( for our church abhors so devilish a tenet ,) who first writ a treatise of the lawfulness of deposing and murdering kings of a different persuasion in religion ; but I am able to prove , from the doctrine of Calvin , and principles of Buchanan , that they set the people above the magistrate ; which , if I mistake not , is your own fundamental , and which carries your loyalty no farther than your liking . When a vote of the House of Commons goes on your side , you are as ready to observe it , as if it were passed into a law ; but , when you are pinched with any former , and yet unrepealed act of parliament , you declare , that , in some cases , you will not be obliged by it . The passage is in the same third part of the “ No-protestant Plot , ” and is too plain to be denied . The late copy of your intended association , you neither wholly justify nor condemn ;<span corresp="#note477" type="note_anchor">[ 477 ]</span>but as the Papists , when they are unopposed , fly out into all the pageantries of worship , but , in times of war , when they are hard pressed by arguments , lie close intrenched behind the council of Trent , so now , when your affairs are in a low condition , you dare not pretend that to be a legal combination , but whensoever you are afloat , I doubt not but it will be maintained and justified to purpose , for , indeed , there is nothing to defend it but the sword ; it is the proper time to say any thing when men have all things in their power .</p>
    <p n="272">In the mean time , you would fain be nibbling at a parallel betwixt this association , and that in the time of Queen Elizabeth .<span corresp="#note478" type="note_anchor">[ 478 ]</span>But there is this small difference betwixt them , that the ends of the one are directly opposite to the other : one , with the queen 's approbation and conjunction , as head of it ; the other , without either the consent or knowledge of the king , against whose authority it is manifestly designed . Therefore you do well to have recourse to your last evasion , that it was contrived by your enemies , and shuffled into the papers that were seized , which yet you see the nation is not so easy to believe as your own jury ; but the matter is not difficult , to find twelve men in Newgate who would acquit a malefactor .</p>
    <p n="273">I have only one favour to desire of you at parting ; that , when you think of answering this poem , you would employ the same pens against it , who have combated with so much success against “ Absalom and Achitophel ; ” for then you may assure yourselves of a clear victory , without the least reply . Rail at me abundantly ; and , not to break a custom , do it without wit : by this method you will gain a considerable point , which is wholly to wave the answer of my arguments .<span corresp="#note479" type="note_anchor">[ 479 ]</span>Never own the bottom of your principles , for fear they should be treason . Fall severely on the miscarriages of government ; for , if scandal be not allowed , you are no free-born subjects . If God has not blessed you with the talent of rhyming , make use of my poor stock , and welcome ; let your verses run upon my feet ; and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads , reduced to the last extremity of sense , turn my own lines upon me , and , in utter despair of your satire , make me satirise myself .<span corresp="#note480" type="note_anchor">[ 480 ]</span>Some of you have been driven to this bay already ; but , above all the rest , commend me to the non-conformist parson , who writ the “ Whip and Key . ” I am afraid it is not read so much as the piece deserves , because the bookseller is every week crying help , at the end of his Gazette , to get it off . You see I am charitable enough to do him a kindness , that it may be published as well as printed ; and that so much skill in Hebrew derivations may not lie for waste-paper in the shop : Yet , I half suspect he went no farther for his learning , than the index of Hebrew names and etymologies , which is printed at the end of some English bibles . If Achitophel signify “ the brother of a fool , ” the author of that poem will pass with his readers for the next of kin ; and perhaps , it is the relation that makes the kindness .<span corresp="#note481" type="note_anchor">[ 481 ]</span>Whatever the verses are , buy them up , I beseech you , out of pity ; for I hear the conventicle is shut up , and the brother of Achitophel out of service .<span corresp="#note482" type="note_anchor">[ 482 ]</span></p>
    <p n="274">Now , footmen , you know , have the generosity to make a purse for a member of their society , who has had his livery pulled over his ears ; and even protestant socks<span corresp="#note484" type="note_anchor">[ 484 ]</span>are bought up among you , out of veneration to the name . A dissenter in poetry from sense and English , will make as good a protestant rhymer , as a dissenter from the church of England a protestant parson . Besides , if you encourage a young beginner , who knows but he may elevate his style a little above the vulgar epithets of “ profane , and saucy Jack , ” and “ atheistic scribbler , ” with which he treats me , when the fit of enthusiasm is strong upon him ; by which well-mannered and charitable expressions , I was certain of his sect before I knew his name . What would you have more of a man ? He has damned me in your cause from Genesis to the Revelations ; and has half the texts of both the Testaments against me , if you will be so civil to yourselves as to take him for your interpreter , and not to take them for Irish witnesses .<span corresp="#note485" type="note_anchor">[ 485 ]</span>After all , perhaps , you will tell me , that you retained him only for the opening of your cause , and that your main lawyer is yet behind . Now , if it so happen he meet with no more reply than his predecessors , you may either conclude that I trust to the goodness of my cause , or fear my adversary , or disdain him , or what you please ; for the short of it is , it is indifferent to your humble servant , whatever your party says or thinks of him .</p>

It was said , to strengthen this suspicion , that Wilson , the earl 's secretary , was employed by him to indorse all the papers which the messengers seized and carried off , and that this scroll bore no such indorsement : it was even added , that Wilson himself was imprisoned , to deprive Shaftesbury of the benefit of his evidence to this point . There is , however , no reason to think the paper was not actually found in the earl 's repositories .</note>
    <note xml:id="note478" place="bottom" n="478">In 1584 , there was a general association entered into by the subjects of Queen Elizabeth , for the defence of her person , supposed to be endangered by the plots of the Catholics and malcontents . Many of its most striking expressions are copied into the draught found in Shaftesbury 's house . It was confirmed by act 27th of Queen Elizabeth , and cannot but be supposed as acceptable to the crown , as that of Shaftesbury would have been obnoxious .</note>
    <note xml:id="note479" place="bottom" n="479">How literally Dryden 's opponents adopted the licence here given , appears from the “ Loyal Medal Vindicated , ” published in 1681 , and addressed ,</note>
    <p n="276">“ To the Disloyal Tories .</p>
    <p n="277">“ To all , I mean , except the author of the Medal ; for he being a Tory of two editions , it seems impossible to appropriate his genius more to King Charles than Oliver Cromwell . And if Noll was so kind , though a saucy tenant , to leave him as a heriot of the muses , unto whomsoever should possess Whitehall , let none admire that he , that could so deify an usurper , does afterwards endeavour to expiate that crime by Torifying the government of a legal monarch , &amp; c. I have no more to say to him , and his Tory friends , by way of argument , but rather greet him , in conclusion , as poetically as he can pretend to deserve . ” The following introduction may suffice to shew how far the poetry was commensurate to the deserts of Dryden :</p>
    <p n="278">If nothing can the worth of men excuse , Thus meanly blasted by a sculking muse ; If what 's against humanity and sense , Finds from the world a horrid complaisance ; If one must flout another 's mould or face , Because discretion there has ancient place ; Then let thy hireling verse such fictions raise , As long may fatten thy desertless praise , But may heaven stay thy much licentious pen , When to spite faces thou shall write again , Lest thou thy sovereign 's image next should stain , Since looks , and men , thou darest traduce for gain ; And all to allow thy forehead so much brass , As stiles thee there a stigmatized ass .</p>
    <p n="279">Conclusion to Shaftesbury :</p>
    <p n="280">Fame must be posed , unless you shall admit To leave your image written by your wit ; Yet still by you memoirs are so designed , } Your medal does oblige , in which we find } The outward graces of so firm a mind ; } Though , in this gift , best Protestants allow They 're tempted even to superstition too , As hard ‘ tis such a patriot to admire , And not than common man to grant him higher . ]</p>
    <note xml:id="note480" place="bottom" n="480">One writer was so much incensed at this challenge , as to plead it for the apology of having degraded himself by a controversy with Dryden . “ I have more honourable employ , than , like a schoolboy , to cap verses , or to blemish my larger name with that of Bayes or Laureat . Only , it moved my indignation , as well as scorn , when I read his challenge to the Whigs , p. 6. of his Epistle , and the bravado extorted from me this nimble check , but just rebuke , for such arrogance , opiniatry , and petulancy , to abate , if possible , his pride , and the contempt he seems to have of the Whigs , whom the hackney laureat does so magisterially despise at such a rate , that the Tory courtiers ( poor hearts , they know no better ) hug and admire the imbost rhodomontade . ” — Mushroom , p. 18 . How far the author 's talents were equal to the purpose of chastizing Dryden , and raising the renown of Whig poetry , may be seen by some curious specimens in Note XII . on the following poem .</note>
    <note xml:id="note481" place="bottom" n="481">As I have not as yet been able to meet with the “ Whip and Key , ” I subjoin the account which Mr Malone has given of it : “ A Whip for the Fool 's Back , who styles honourable marriage a cursed confinement , in his profane poem of Absalom and Achitophel ; ” and this was followed , on the 18th of January , by “ A Key ( with the Whip ) to open the mystery and iniquity of the poem called Absalom and Achitophel , shewing its scurrilous reflections on both king and kingdom . ” In the latter piece , which was written by the same hand as the former , the author 's principal object is to show , that Dryden 's Jewish names were not well chosen . As probably very few of my readers have ever seen this poem , I will add a short extract :</note>
    <p n="281">“ How well this Hebrew name with sense doth sound , A fool 's my brother ,<span corresp="#note483" type="note_anchor">[ 483 ]</span>though in wit profound ! Most wicked wits are the devil 's chiefest tools , Which , ever in the issue , God befools . Can thy compare , vile varlet , once hold true , Of the loyal Lord , and this disloyal Jew ? Was e'er our English Earl under disgrace , And , as unconscionable , put out of place ? Hath he laid lurking in his country-house , To plot rebellions , as one factious ? Thy bog-trot bloodhounds hunted have this stag , Yet cannot fasten their foul fangs ,— they flag . Why did'st not thou bring in thy evidence , With them , to rectify the brave jury 's sense , And so prevent the Ignoramus ?— nay , Thou wast cock-sure he would be damn 'd for aye , Without thy presence ;— thou wast then employ 'd To brand him ‘ gainst he came to be destroy 'd : ‘ Forehand preparing for the hangman 's axe , Had not the witnesses been found so lax . ”</p>

    <p n="283">It must also be noticed , that the author of the “ Whip and Key ” opens his poem with the ten first lines of “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” ]</p>
    <note xml:id="note482" place="bottom" n="482">Derrick is pleased to explain “ the brother of Achitophel , ” by favouring us with an account of Shaftesbury 's brother , George Cooper , Esq . This is a remarkable instance of a knavish speech sleeping in a foolish ear . For the benefit of any person of equally obtuse intellects , it may be necessary to say , the non-conformist parson is the party meant , whom Dryden styles “ brother to Achitophel , ” if Achitophel , according to his own derivation , be brother to a fool ; and truly the commentator seems to have been of the kindred .</note>

Blest muse , whose wit with such a cause was crowned , And blest the cause that such a champion found ; With chosen verse upon the foe he falls , And black sedition in each quarter galls ; Yet , like a prince with subjects forced to engage , Secure of conquest , he rebates his rage ; His fury not without distinction sheds , Hurls mortal bolts but on devoted heads : To less infected members gentle found , Or spares , or else pours balm into the wound . Such generous grace the ungrateful tribe abuse , And trespass on the mercy of his muse ; Their wretched doggrell rhimers forth they bring , To snarl and bark against the poet 's king : A crew , that scandalize the nation more Than all their treason-canting priests before ! On these he scarce vouchsafes a scornful smile , But on their powerful patrons turns his style : A style so keen , as even from faction draws The vital poison , stabs to the heart their cause . Take then , great bard , what tribute we can raise ; Accept our thanks , for you transcend our praise .</p>

    <p n="294">ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL .</p>
    <p n="295">Thus pious ignorance , with dubious praise , Altars of old , to gods unknown , did raise : They knew not the loved Deity , they knew Divine effects a cause divine did shew : Nor can we doubt , when such these numbers are , } Such is their cause , though the worst muse shall dare } Their sacred worth in humble verse declare . } As gentle Thames , charmed with thy tuneful song , Glides in a peaceful majesty along ; No rebel stone , no lofty bank , does brave The easy passage of his silent wave ; So , sacred poet , so thy numbers flow , Sinewy , yet mild , as happy lovers woo ; Strong , yet harmonious too , as planets move , Yet soft as down upon the wings of love . How sweet does virtue in your dress appear ! How much more charming , when much less severe ! Whilst you our senses harmlessly beguile , With all the allurements of your happy style ; You insinuate loyalty with kind deceit , And into sense the unthinking many cheat : So the sweet Thracian , with his charming lyre , Into rude nature virtue did inspire ; So he the savage herd to reason drew , Yet scarce so sweet , so charmingly , as you . Oh that you would , with some such powerful charm , Enervate Albion to just valour warm ! Whether much-suffering Charles shall theme afford , Or the great deeds of god-like James 's sword ; Again fair Gallia might be ours , again Another fleet might pass the subject main ; Another Edward lead the Britains on , Or such an Ossory as you did moan : While in such numbers you , in such a strain , Inflame their courage , and reward their pain . Let false Achitophel the rout engage , Talk easy Absalom to rebel rage ; Let frugal Shimei curse in holy zeal , Or modest Corah more new plots reveal ; Whilst constant to himself , secure of fate , Good David still maintains the royal state ; Though each in vain such various ills employs , Firmly he stands , and even those ills enjoys ; Firm as fair Albion midst the raging main , Surveys encircling danger with disdain . In vain the waves assault the unmoved shore , } In vain the winds with mingled fury roar , } Fair Albion 's beauteous cliffs shine whiter than before . } Nor shalt thou move , though hell thy fall conspire , Though the worse rage of zeal 's fanatic fire , Thou best , thou greatest of the British race , Thou only fit to fill great Charles his place . Ah wretched Britons ! ah too stubborn isle ! Ah stiff-necked Israel on blest Canaan 's soil ! Are those dear proofs of heaven 's indulgence vain , Restoring David and his gentle reign ? Is it in vain thou all the goods dost know , } Auspicious stars on mortals shed below , } While all thy streams with milk , thy lands with honey flow ? } No more , fond isle ! no more thyself engaged , In civil fury , and intestine rage , No rebel zeal thy duteous land molest , But a smooth calm sooth every peaceful breast , While in such charming notes divinely sings The best of poets , of the best of kings .</p>

Of all our antic sights and pageantry , Which English idiots run in crowds to see , The Polish Medal<span type="note_anchor">[ 487 ]</span>bears the prize alone ; } A monster , more the favourite of the town } Than either fairs or theatres have shown . } Never did art so well with nature strive , Nor ever idol seemed so much alive ; So like the man , so golden to the sight , So base within , so counterfeit and light . One side is filled with title and with face ; And , lest the king should want a regal place , On the reverse a Tower the town surveys , O'er which our mounting sun his beams displays The word , pronounced aloud by shrieval voice , LÆTAMUR , which , in Polish , is rejoice ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 488 ]</span>The day , month , year , to the great act are joined , And a new canting holiday designed ; Five days he sat for every cast and look , Four more than God to finish Adam took . But who can tell what essence angels are ? Or how long Heaven was making Lucifer ? Oh , could the style that copied every grace , And plowed such furrows for an eunuch face , Could it have formed his ever-changing will , The various piece had tired the graver 's skill ! A martial hero first , with early care , Blown , like a pigmy by the winds , to war ; A beardless chief , a rebel ere a man ; So young his hatred to his prince began .<span type="note_anchor">[ 489 ]</span>Next this ,— how wildly will ambition steer ! A vermin wriggling in the usurper 's ear ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 490 ]</span>Bartering his venal wit for sums of gold , He cast himself into the saint-like mould ; Groaned , sighed , and prayed , while godliness was gain , The loudest bagpipe of the squeaking train . But , as ‘ tis hard to cheat a juggler 's eyes , His open lewdness he could ne'er disguise .<span type="note_anchor">[ 491 ]</span>There split the saint ; for hypocritic zeal Allows no sins but those it can conceal : Whoring to scandal gives too large a scope ; Saints must not trade , but they may interlope : The ungodly principle was all the same ; But a gross cheat betrays his partner 's game . Besides , their pace was formal , grave , and slack ; His nimble wit outran the heavy pack ; Yet still he found his fortune at a stay , Whole droves of blockheads choking up his way ; They took , but not rewarded , his advice ; Villain and wit exact a double price . Power was his aim ; but thrown from that pretence , } The wretch turned loyal in his own defence , } And malice reconciled him to his prince<span type="note_anchor">[ 492 ]</span>} Him , in the anguish of his soul , he served ; Rewarded faster still than he deserved .<span type="note_anchor">[ 493 ]</span>Behold him now exalted into trust ; His counsel 's oft convenient , seldom just ; Even in the most sincere advice he gave , He had a grudging still to be a knave . The frauds , he learned in his fanatic years , Made him uneasy in his lawful gears ; At best , as little honest as he could , And , like white witches , mischievously good ; To his first bias longingly he leans , And rather would be great by wicked means . Thus framed for ill , he loosed our triple hold ; Advice unsafe , precipitous , and bold . From hence those tears , that Ilium of our woe ! Who helps a powerful friend , forearms a foe . What wonder if the waves prevail so far , When he cut down the banks that made the bar ? Seas follow but their nature to invade ; But he , by art , our native strength betrayed : So Samson to his foe his force confest , And , to be shorn , lay slumbering on her breast . But when this fatal counsel , found too late , Exposed its author to the public hate ; When his just sovereign by no impious way Could be seduced to arbitrary sway ; Forsaken of that hope , he shifts his sail , } Drives down the current with a popular gale , } And shows the fiend confessed without a veil .<span type="note_anchor">[ 494 ]</span>} He preaches to the crowd , that power is lent , But not conveyed , to kingly government ; That claims successive bear no binding force ; That coronation oaths are things of course ; Maintains the multitude can never err ; And sets the people in the papal chair . The reason 's obvious ,— interest never lies ; } The most have still their interest in their eyes ; } The power is always theirs , and power is ever wise . } Almighty crowd ! thou shortenest all dispute ; Power is thy essence , wit thy attribute ! Nor faith nor reason make thee at a stay ; Thou leapst o'er all eternal truths in thy pindaric way ! Athens , no doubt , did righteously decide , When Phocion and when Socrates were tried ; As righteously they did those dooms repent ; Still they were wise , whatever way they went : Crowds err not , though to both extremes they run ; To kill the father , and recal the son . Some think the fools were most as times went then , But now the world 's o'erstocked with prudent men . The common cry is even religion 's test ,— The Turk 's is at Constantinople best , Idols in India , popery at Rome , And our own worship only true at home ; And true but for the time , ‘ tis hard to know How long we please it shall continue so ; This side to-day , and that to-morrow burns ; So all are God-almighties in their turns . A tempting doctrine , plausible and new ; What fools our fathers were , if this be true ! Who , to destroy the seeds of civil war , Inherent right in monarchs did declare ; And , that a lawful power might never cease , Secured succession to secure our peace . Thus property and sovereign sway at last In equal balances were justly cast ; But this new Jehu spurs the hot-mouthed horse , Instructs the beast to know his native force , To take the bit between his teeth , and fly To the next headlong steep of anarchy . Too happy England , if our good we knew , Would we possess the freedom we pursue ! The lavish government can give no more ; Yet we repine , and plenty makes us poor . God tried us once ; our rebel fathers fought ; He glutted them with all the power they sought , Till , mastered by their own usurping brave , The free-born subject sunk into a slave . We loath our manna , and we long for quails ; Ah , what is man , when his own wish prevails ! How rash , how swift to plunge himself in ill , Proud of his power , and boundless in his will ! That kings can do no wrong , we must believe ; None can they do , and must they all receive ? Help , heaven ! or sadly we shall see an hour , When neither wrong nor right are in their power ! Already they have lost their best defence , The benefit of laws , which they dispense ; No justice to their righteous cause allowed , But baffled by an arbitrary crowd ; And medals graved their conquest to record , The stamp and coin of their adopted lord . The man , who laughed but once to see an ass Mumbling to make the cross-grained thistles pass ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 495 ]</span>Might laugh again to see a jury chew The prickles of unpalatable law . The witnesses , that leech-like lived on blood , Sucking for them were med'cinally good ; But when they fastened on their festered sore , } Then justice and religion they forswore ; } Their maiden oaths debauched into a whore . } Thus men are raised by factions , and decried , And rogue and saint distinguished by their side ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 496 ]</span>They rack even scripture to confess their cause , And plead a call to preach in spite of laws . But that 's no news to the poor injured page , It has been used as ill in every age ; And is constrained with patience all to take , For what defence can Greek and Hebrew make ? Happy , who can this talking trumpet seize ; They make it speak whatever sense they please ! ‘ Twas framed at first our oracle , to enquire ; } But since our sects in prophecy grow higher , } The text inspires not them , but they the text inspire . } London , thou great emporium of our isle , O thou too bounteous , thou too fruitful Nile ! How shall I praise or curse to thy desert ? Or separate thy sound from thy corrupted part ? I called thee Nile ; the parallel will stand : Thy tides of wealth o'erflow the fattened land ; Yet monsters from thy large increase we find , Engendered on the slime thou leav'st behind . Sedition has not wholly seized on thee , Thy nobler parts are from infection free . Of Israel 's tribes thou hast a numerous band , But still the Canaanite is in the land ; Thy military chiefs are brave and true , Nor are thy disenchanted burghers few ; The head is loyal which thy heart commands , But what 's a head with two such gouty hands ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 497 ]</span>The wise and wealthy love the surest way , And are content to thrive and to obey . But wisdom is to sloth too great a slave ; None are so busy as the fool and knave . Those let me curse ; what vengeance will they urge , Whose ordures neither plague nor fire can purge ; Nor sharp experience can to duty bring , Nor angry heaven , nor a forgiving king ! In gospel-phrase their chapmen they betray ; Their shops are dens , the buyer is their prey : The knack of trades is living on the spoil ; They boast even when each other they beguile . Customs to steal is such a trivial thing , That ‘ tis their charter to defraud their king . All hands unite of every jarring sect ; They cheat the country first , and then infect . They for God 's cause their monarchs dare dethrone , And they 'll be sure to make his cause their own . Whether the plotting jesuit laid the plan Of murdering kings , or the French puritan , Our sacrilegious sects their guides outgo , And kings and kingly power would murder too . What means their traitorous combination less , Too plain to evade , too shameful to confess ! But treason is not owned when ‘ tis descried ; Successful crimes alone are justified . The men , who no conspiracy would find , Who doubts , but , had it taken , they had joined ,— Joined in a mutual covenant of defence , At first without , at last against , their prince ? If sovereign right by sovereign power they scan , The same bold maxim holds in God and man : God were not safe , his thunder could they shun , He should be forced to crown another son . Thus , when the heir was from the vineyard thrown , The rich possession was the murderer 's own .<span type="note_anchor">[ 498 ]</span>In vain to sophistry they have recourse ; } By proving their 's no plot , they prove ‘ tis worse , } Unmasked rebellion , and audacious force ; } Which , though not actual , yet all eyes may see , ‘ Tis working in the immediate power to be ; For from pretended grievances they rise , First to dislike , and after to despise ; Then , cyclop-like , in human flesh to deal , Chop up a minister at every meal ; Perhaps not wholly to melt down the king , But clip his regal rights within the ring ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 499 ]</span>From thence to assume the power of peace and war , And ease him , by degrees , of public care : Yet , to consult his dignity and fame , } He should have leave to exercise the name , } And hold the cards while commons played the game . } For what can power give more than food and drink , To live at ease , and not be bound to think ? These are the cooler methods of their crime , But their hot zealots think ‘ tis loss of time ; On utmost bounds of loyalty they stand , } And grin and whet like a Croatian band , } That waits impatient for the last command . } Thus outlaws open villainy maintain ; They steal not , but in squadrons scour the plain ; And if their power the passengers subdue , The most have right , the wrong is in the few . Such impious axioms foolishly they show , For in some soils republics will not grow : Our temperate isle will no extremes sustain Of popular sway , or arbitrary reign ; But slides between them both into the best , Secure in freedom , in a monarch blest ; And though the climate , vexed with various winds , Works through our yielding bodies on our minds , The wholesome tempest purges what it breeds , To recommend the calmness that succeeds . But thou , the pandar of the people 's hearts , O crooked soul , and serpentine in arts , Whose blandishments a loyal land have whored , And broke the bonds she plighted to her lord ; What curses on thy blasted name will fall , } Which age to age their legacy shall call ! } For all must curse the woes that must descend on all . } Religion thou hast none : thy mercury Has passed through every sect , or theirs through thee . But what thou givest , that venom still remains , And the poxed nation feels thee in their brains . What else inspires the tongues , and swells the breasts , Of all thy bellowing renegado priests ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 500 ]</span>That preach up thee for God , dispense thy laws , And with thy stum ferment their fainting cause ; Fresh fumes of madness raise , and toil and sweat , To make the formidable cripple great ? Yet should thy crimes succeed , should lawless power Compass those ends thy greedy hopes devour , Thy canting friends thy mortal foes would be , Thy God and theirs will never long agree ; For thine , if thou hast any , must be one , That lets the world and human-kind alone ; A jolly god , that passes hours too well , To promise heaven , or threaten us with hell ; That unconcerned can at rebellion sit , And wink at crimes he did himself commit . A tyrant theirs ; the heaven their priesthood paints A conventicle of gloomy sullen saints ; A heaven , like Bedlam , slovenly and sad , Fore-doomed for souls with false religion mad . Without a vision , poets can foreshow What all but fools , by common sense , may know : If true succession from our isle should fail , And crowds profane , with impious arms , prevail , Not thou , nor those thy factious arts engage , } Shall reap that harvest of rebellious rage , } With which thou flatterest thy decrepid age .<span type="note_anchor">[ 501 ]</span>} The swelling poison of the several sects , Which , wanting vent , the nation 's health infects , Shall burst its bag , and , fighting out their way , The various venoms on each other prey . The presbyter , puffed up with spiritual pride , Shall on the necks of the lewd nobles ride ; His brethren damn , the civil power defy , And parcel out republic prelacy . But short shall be his reign ; his rigid yoke , And tyrant power , will puny sects provoke ; And frogs and toads , and all the tadpole train , Will croak to heaven for help from this devouring crane . The cut-throat sword and clamorous gown shall jar , In sharing their ill-gotten spoils of war ; Chiefs shall be grudged the part which they pretend ; } Lords envy lords , and friends with every friend } About their impious merit shall contend . } The surly commons shall respect deny , And jostle peerage out with property . Their general either shall his trust betray , And force the crowd to arbitrary sway ; Or they , suspecting his ambitious aim , } In hate of kings shall cast anew the frame , } And thrust out Collatine ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 502 ]</span>that bore their name . } Thus , inborn broils the factions would engage , } Or wars of exiled heirs , or foreign rage , } Till halting vengeance overtook our age ; } And our wild labours , wearied into rest , Reclined us on a rightful monarch 's breast . ——— Pudet hæc opprobria , vobis Et dici potuisse , et non potuisse refelli .

    <head>NOTES ON THE MEDAL .</head>
    <p n="296">Note I .</p>
    <p n="297">The Polish medal .— P . 431 .</p>
    <p n="298">It was a standing joke among the opponents of Shaftesbury , that he hoped to be chosen king of Poland at the vacancy , when John Sobieski was elected . This was probably only a revival and new edition of an improbable story , that he expected Cromwell would have made him king of England . His supposed election , its causes , and effects , are very humorously stated in a pamphlet republished among Lord Somers ’ Tracts , already quoted , pp . 263 , 358 .</p>
    <p n="299">The author complains ironically , that , among the advantages of court favour , which Lord Shaftesbury had renounced for his country , already enumerated by one of his adherents , he had omitted to mention a yet more dignified sacrifice :</p>
    <p n="300">“ I suppose , there are very few in this kingdom , that do not very sensibly remember the late inter-regnum in Poland , and how many illustrious candidates stood fair for the election . Sobieski , indeed , had done great things for that people ; he had kept their potent enemy , the Turk , from entering any farther upon their frontier ; was great and popular in the esteem and love of the best army , that , perhaps , they ever had ; but , that was by much too little to entitle him to the succession of the throne , it appearing absolutely the interest of that nation , that the great Turk was not only to be beaten , but he must , in short , also be converted . And who so fit for such an enterprize as he that should be promoted to the regal authority ? One that , from the high place he was to possess , might not only administer justice to them , but salvation to the greater part of Asia . ” —</p>
    <p n="301">“ Upon these considerations , you may imagine quickly the eyes of the whole diet were cast upon little England , and thereupon whom so soon as the little Lord of Shaftesbury ? Polish deputies were immediately sent , post-incognito , with the imperial crown and sceptre in a cloak-bag to him . Old Blood<span corresp="#note503" type="note_anchor">[ 503 ]</span>smelled it from Bishopgate-street ; and had it not been for an old acquaintance and friendship between King Anthony the Elect , for now I must call him so , and himself , I am credibly informed he had laid an ambush for it at the Cock ale-house , by Temple-Bar , where some thirty indigent bullies were eating stuffed beef , helter-skelter , at his charge , on purpose to stand by and assist him at carrying off the booty .</p>
    <p n="302">“ But heaven , which I hope has ordained that no crown shall ever suffer damage for King Anthony 's sake , took care to preserve this . For the sinister designs of the old Irish crown-monger being yet to be doubted , this prudent prince , as I am told , having tried and fitted it to his head , carefully sent it back again by a trusty messenger , concealed in the husk or shell of a Holland cheese , taken asunder merely for that purpose , and cemented again together by an art fit for no man to know , but a king presumptive of Poland .</p>
    <p n="303">“ All things thus prepared , his election being carried in the diet so unanimously , and so nemine contradicente , that no man to this hour ever heard of it but himself , it is not to be imagined how this little Grig was transported with the thoughts of growing into a leviathan ; he fancied himself the picture before Hobb 's Commonwealth already ; nay , he stopt up his tap , as I am told , on purpose that his dropsy might swell him big enough for his majesty , and of a sudden grew so utter an enemy to all republics and anti-monarchical constitutions , that from that hour he premeditated and laid the foundation of a worse speech than that famous one which he once uttered in our English senate — Delenda est Carthago .</p>
    <p n="304">“ But now , upon deliberate and weighty consideration of the great change he was to undertake , many difficulties , and of an extraordinary nature , seemed to arise . A Protestant king being elected to a Popish kingdom , great were the debates within himself , which way he was to steer his course in the administration of his government , so as to discharge his conscience , as well in the case incumbent upon him of the souls of his people , as of the protection of their properties and persons .</p>
    <p n="305">“ The Great Turk , you have heard before , was to be converted . Now , to bring so mighty a potentate over to the church of Rome , seemed altogether destructive of the Protestant interest , for which , he has been always so violent a champion ; therefore it is resolved , Protestant , and true Protestant , the Ottoman Emperor must be , or nothing . But how , when that was done , to establish the same church in his dominions ? There was the great question . Whereupon , after due consideration , he resolved , at his taking possession of that throne , which stood gaping for him , to carry over from hence such ministers , both of church and state , as might be proper to advise , assist , and support him in a design so pious , though so difficult . ”</p>
    <p n="306">A list is therefore made out of Shaftesbury 's real or supposed adherents , with absurd Polish terminations attached to their names , to whom what the satirist deemed suitable offices in King Anthony 's court , are respectively assigned . Among these , the reader will be startled to find our author himself under the following entry :</p>
    <p n="307">“ Jean Drydenurtziz . Our poet laureat for writing panegyrics upon Oliver Cromwell , and libels against his present master , King Charles II . of England .</p>
    <p n="308">“ Tom Shadworiski . His deputy . ”</p>
    <p n="309">From which it appears , that Dryden , at the time of this pasquinade 's being written , was considered as disaffected to the court .</p>
    <p n="310">The joke of Shaftesbury 's election to the Polish throne having been once thrown out , was echoed , and re-echoed , through an hundred ballads , till it ceased to be a joke at all . The reader must have frequently remarked such allusions ; we have , for instance , the following songs :</p>
    <p n="311">“ Dagon 's Fall , or the Whigs Lament for Anthony , King of Poland . ” ( 3d February , 1682-3 . )</p>
    <p n="312">“ A New Song on the King of Poland , and the Prince of the Land of Promise . ”</p>
    <p n="313">“ The Poet 's Address to his most Sacred Majesty , 6th July , 1682 . ”</p>
    <p n="314">The Polish prince is charmed , he scorns weak buff , Conscience 's of impenetrable stuff .</p>
    <p n="315">Note II .</p>
    <p n="316">Lætamur , which , in Polish , is rejoice .— P . 431 .</p>
    <p n="317">It would seem , that the followers of Shaftesbury wore the medal attached to their breast . See “ A Panegyrick on their Royal Highnesses , and congratulating his return from Scotland , 1682 . ”</p>
    <p n="318">Lætamur is the word , a word which late As mighty hopes did mighty joy create ; When the famed motto with applause was put To the effigy of the grand patriot . Nearest their heart where late their Georges hung , The pale-faced medal with its silver tongue Was placed , whilst every wearer still exprest His joy to harbour there so famed a guest : The wretch that stamped it got immortal fame , T'was coined by stealth , like groats at Brumichan ; While each possessor , with exalted voice , Cries , “ England 's saved , and now let us rejoice . ”</p>
    <p n="319">Note III .</p>
    <p n="320">A martial hero first , with early care , Blown , like a pigmy by the winds , to war ; A beardless chief , a rebel ere a man ; So young his hatred to his prince began .— P . 432 .</p>
    <p n="321">Dryden does not here do justice to Shaftesbury , who certainly offered Charles I. the first fruits of his courage and address . Being heir to a plentiful fortune , a member of parliament , and high sheriff of the county of Dorset , he came to Oxford when the civil war broke out , and though then only twenty-one or twenty-two years of age , presented to the king a digested plan , for compromising matters between him and his subjects in arms against him : Charles observed , he was a very young man for so great an undertaking ; to which , with the readiness which marked his character , he answered , that would not be the worse for the king 's affairs , provided the business was done . He had , in consequence , a commission from the king , to promise indemnity and redress of grievances to such of the parliamentary garrisons as would lay down their arms . Accordingly , his plan seems to have taken some effect ; for Weymouth actually surrendered to the king , and Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper , as his stile then was , was made governor . Some delays occurred in the course of his obtaining this office ; and whether disgusted with these , and giving scope to the natural instability of his temper , as is intimated by Clarendon , or offended , as Mr Locke states , at Weymouth having been plundered by Prince Maurice 's forces , he made one of those sudden turns , of which his political career furnishes several instances , and went over to the other side . After this , Clarendon says , that he “ gave up himself , body and soul , to the parliament , and became an implacable enemy to the royal family . ” He raised forces in Dorsetshire , with which he took Wareham by storm , in October 1644 , and reduced the greater part of the county to the obedience of the parliament . He held various high charges under the authority of the republic . In 1645 , he was sheriff of Norfolk ; in 1646 , sheriff of Wiltshire ; and in 1651 , one of that committee , which was named for the revisal and reform of the law .</p>
    <p n="322">Note IV .</p>
    <p n="323">A vermin wriggling in the usurer 's ear .— P . 432 .</p>
    <p n="324">Shaftesbury was by no means in a hurry to submit to Cromwell 's domination , any more than he had been to join the parliament ; the uncontrouled authority of an individual , and of one too who was inaccessible to all arts of cajoling or management , and only acted upon his own opinions and impulses , presented to the art and ambition of our statesman a very unpromising field of exertion . Accordingly , he is said to have been active in opposing the dispossession of the long parliament ; and , being a member of that convoked by the Protector in 1656 , he signed the famous protestation against the personal usurpation of Cromwell , which occasioned a very sudden dissolution of that assembly . But notwithstanding this occasional opposition , he sat in all Cromwell 's parliaments , was a member of his privy council , and was so far in his favour , that he is said by his enemies to have nourished hopes of succeeding him in his power , with which view he aimed to become his son-in-law . Hence he is called , in the “ Dream of the Cabal , ”</p>
    <p n="325">“ A little bob-tailed lord , urchin of state , A praise-god-bare-bone peer , whom all men hate . ” State Poems , Vol . I. p. 148 .</p>
    <p n="326">Note V .</p>
    <p n="327">He cast himself into the saint-like mould ; Groaned , sighed , and prayed , while godliness was gain , The loudest bagpipe of the squeaking train . But , as ‘ tis hard to cheat a juggler 's eyes , His open lewdness he could ne'er disguise .— P . 432 .</p>
    <p n="328">According to North , the Earl of Shaftesbury , “ in all his ways and workings , held a concert with the antimonarchists and fanatics . "[ 504 ] As to his dissipation , the well-known speech of Charles II ., and his reply , are sufficient evidence . “ I believe , Shaftesbury , ” said the gay monarch , “ thou art the wickedest dog in England . ” “ May it please your majesty , ” retorted the statesman , “ of a subject I believe I am . ” North , the recorder of all that was evil concerning him , says , “ whether out of inclination , custom , or policy , I will not determine , it is certain , he was not behind hand with the court in the modest pleasures of the time , and to what excess of libertinism they were commonly grown , is no secret . There was a deformed old gentleman , called Sir Paul Neal , who , they say , sat for the picture of Sydrophel , in Hudibras ; and about town was called the Lord Shaftesbury 's groom , because he watered his mares ( I forbear the vulgar word ) in Hyde Park , with Rhenish wine and sugar , and not seldom a bait of cheese-cakes . "[ 505 ]</p>

    <p n="330">Power was his aim ; but thrown from that pretence , The wretch turned loyal in his own defence , And malice reconciled him to his prince .— P . 432 .</p>
    <p n="331">Whatever Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper 's private political principles might be , he failed not to take a share of power upon the changes which so rapidly succeeded the death of Cromwell . Under the Rump parliament , he was one of the council of state , and a commissioner for managing the army , one of the committee to secure the Tower , and colonel of a regiment of horse . He made use of the influence which these situations afforded him , for hastening the Restoration . Sir Anthony had long held a secret correspondence with the loyal party , and was to have joined Sir George Booth at his rising , had he not been so suddenly crushed .<span corresp="#note506" type="note_anchor">[ 506 ]</span></p>
    <p n="332">He was taxed with this intended co-operation in parliament ; but he was at least resolved not to bear witness against himself , for he made the highest professions of his innocence , and imprecated God 's judgments on him and his posterity , if he had the slightest communication with the king , or his friends :[ 507 ] Nevertheless , he was one of those who invited Monk into England ; was the first to supply him with a regiment of horse ; was active in defeating the schemes of Lambert ; and , in conclusion , was named one of the twelve members , who were deputed by the House of Commons to invite the king to return to his dominions .</p>
    <p n="333">Note VII .</p>
    <p n="334">Him , in the anguish of his soul , he served ; Rewarded faster still than he deserved . Behold him now exalted into trust .— P . 432 .</p>
    <p n="335">“ At the time of his majesty 's restoration , as a most signal testimony of his majesty 's good sentiments of his former actions , Shaftesbury was advanced to be one of the first rank in his majesty 's most honourable privy council , and was placed above his majesty 's royal brother , the Duke of Gloucester , and even General Monk himself , whom his majesty used to call his political father . And about three days before his majesty 's coronation , he was in the Banquetting-house created Baron Ashley of Wimbourn , St Giles ; and another addition of honour was conferred on him , Lord Cooper of Paulett ; and at last , in the year 1672 , he was made Earl of Shaftesbury , at the same time when Duke Lauderdale , the Earl of Arlington , and the Lord Clifford , were promoted . "[ 508 ] To these honours were added substantial power and weight in the administration , called the cabal , from the initial letters of the ministers , names who composed it .<span corresp="#note509" type="note_anchor">[ 509 ]</span>In this ministry , Shaftesbury was Chancellor of the Exchequer ; and , on the resignation of Lord Keeper Bridgeman , became Lord High Chancellor of England . In this high station , he furthered , with all his policy and eloquence , the union with France against Holland , and the breach of the triple league ; fatal measures , which tended to the destruction of our natural barrier against the universal dominion of France . It is probable , that Shaftesbury 's ardent spirit flattered itself with the hopes of conducting a popular and triumphant war . But whatever were his motives , let it be remembered , to his honour , that French bribery , so common among the British ministers of the period , had no influence with Shaftesbury . Whether he found the war , ill managed by the court , and ill relished by the nation , was likely to do very little honour to those who had pushed it on ; or whether he was dissatisfied with the share he enjoyed of the king 's favour ; or , finally , whether distrusting the easiness and mutability of the king 's temper , is absolutely uncertain ; but , moved either by these , or more patriotic motives , Shaftesbury , in the parliament of 1672-3 , although in office , showed himself prepared to join opposition on very short notice .</p>
    <p n="336">Note VIII .</p>
    <p n="337">But when this fatal counsel , found too late , Exposed its author to the public hate ; When his just sovereign by no impious way Could be seduced to arbitrary sway ; Forsaken of that hope , he shifts his sail , } Drives down the current with a popular gale , } And shows the fiend confessed without a veil .— P . 433 . }</p>
    <p n="338">Two circumstances seem chiefly to have influenced Shaftesbury in his change of politics in 1672 . Some vacancies had occurred in the House of Commons , during a recess of parliament . These his lordship , as chancellor , had caused to be filled up , by issuing writs for election , of his own authority , without waiting for the speaker 's warrant ; a proceeding , which was deemed by the House an undue exertion of prerogative , and the elections were declared irregular and null . This greatly irritated Shaftesbury 's haughty temper , who thought the crown did not support him with sufficient energy , in a step which he had taken to extend its influence . From this he judged , that the king had not energy sufficient to venture upon bold measures ; and , consequently , that there was no room for the game of a minister , who delighted in bold and masterly strokes of policy . But this was yet more to be inferred from the king 's conduct in the matter of the Indulgence . This was a declaration , which the king , by advice of Shaftesbury and his other ministers , had sent forth , on the 25th March , 1672 , dispensing with the penal laws against non-conformists of every description , and indulging to Protestant dissenters the public , and to Catholics the private exercise of their religious worship . It is remarkable , that Shaftesbury , afterwards the champion for the test against popery , was made chancellor , chiefly for the purpose of affixing the great seal to this declaration , which the Lord Keeper Bridgeman refused to do . The House of Commons remonstrated against this exercise of prerogative . After an inefficient struggle , Charles recalled the declaration , and broke the seals with his own hand . From that moment Shaftesbury declared , that the king had forsaken himself , and deserved to be forsaken . Suspicious that a monarch , who preferred so evidently his peace and pleasures to his prerogative , would not hesitate to make the lesser sacrifice of an obnoxious minister ; anxious also , on account of the preponderance of the Duke of York , who hated him , and whom he hated , the Chancellor probably foresaw , that , in making an apparent sacrifice of court favour , he would not only save himself , but become the leader , instead of being the victim , of the popular faction . Accordingly , he promoted the test act in the House of Commons , and stood forth in the House of Lords as the leader of the Protestant party , whom the declaration had grievously alarmed . From so unexpected a change , at this eventful period , his removal from office was a matter of course . But in the mode of accomplishing it , circumstances occurred , which strongly mark the character of Shaftesbury , who delighted in an opportunity of teasing and alarming his enemies , even in the very act of retreating before them . When he waited upon the king , to surrender the seals , he observed a circle of his enemies in the anti-chamber , anticipating , with triumph , his returning without these badges of his office . Upon obtaining his audience , the falling minister begged the king , that his dismissal might be so arranged , as not to appear as it he was thrown off with contempt . “ Godsfish , ” replied the good-natured monarch , “ I will not do it with any circumstance that looks like an affront . ” The earl then begged permission to carry the seals before the king to chapel , and return them afterwards from his house . His boon being granted , he carried on the conversation with much humour , upon such gay subjects as usually entertained the king , while his adversaries , upon the tenterhooks of anxiety , awaited the issue of so long an audience . But when they saw the king and the chancellor come out together smiling , and go in company to the chapel , the party concluded Shaftesbury 's peace was made , and his expected successor was inconsolable . After enjoying this little triumph , Shaftesbury sent the seals to the king , and placed himself at the head of the country party , who , from the general and well-founded opinion of his talents , did not hesitate to adopt as their leader , one who had just deserted the banners of the enemy .</p>
    <p n="339">From this time , Shaftesbury must always be considered as in opposition to the court . For , although a number of the country party were admitted into the council of state , formed by the advice of Temple , and Shaftesbury himself was president , he was , in fact , no more united to the king 's party , than a detachment of besiegers become a part of the garrison of a besieged town , because a bastion or redoubt has been surrendered to them by capitulation .</p>

    <p n="341">Thus men are raised by factions , and decried , And rogue and saint distinguished by their side .— P . 435 .</p>
    <p n="342">This was the argument concerning the credibility of the plot-witnesses , which was so triumphantly urged by the Tories , who asked , “ Are not these men good witnesses , upon whose testimony Stafford , and so many Catholics , have been executed , and whom you yourselves have so long celebrated as men of credit and veracity ? You have admitted them into your bosom ; they are best acquainted with your treasons . They are determined in another shape to serve their king and country ; and you cannot complain , that the same measure which you meted to others , should now , by a righteous doom of vengeance , be measured out to you . "[ 510 ] To this there was but one answer : “ We have been duped by our own prejudices , and the perjury of these men ; but you , by employing against us witnesses whom you know to be forsworn villains , and whom their versatility has sufficiently proved to be such , are doing with your eyes open what we did in the blindness of prejudice , and are worse than us , as guilt is worse than folly . ” But this , though the Whigs ’ true defence , required a candid disavowal of the Popish plot , and reprobation of the witnesses ; and that no true Protestant would submit to .</p>

    <p n="344">Thy military chiefs are brave and true , Nor are thy disenchanted burghers few ; The head is loyal which thy heart commands , But what 's a head , with two such gouty hands ?— P . 436 .</p>
    <p n="345">As matters carried more and more the appearance of actual insurrection and civil war , the more wealthy of the citizens of London , to whom nothing could be more ruinous than such an event , began to draw to the royal party . They were grieved also , that the ancient course of feasting and hospitality , observed by former sheriffs , had given way for furious cabals in coffee-houses ; and , by degrees , a large body of citizens , who had , according to North , good hearts , and good spirits , were formed for the purpose of restoring the ancient order and course of living in the city . By means of this party , Sir John Moor was elected Lord Mayor ; for whose character and conduct , and that of Shute and Pilkington , the Whig sheriffs , whom Dryden here terms his “ two gouty hands , ” see the two last notes on the Second Part of “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” pp . 401 , 403 . It was a great advantage to the court , that the military chiefs of the city , i. e. the officers of the trained bands , &amp; c. were attached to the royal cause ; and it was very much by their emphatic interference , that the election of sheriffs for 1683 was carried against the Whig party .</p>

    <p n="347">Perhaps not wholly to melt down the king , But clip his regal rights within the ring .— P . 437 .</p>
    <p n="348">Until 1663 , milled money was not struck in England ; and the hammered coin , which continued to be in circulation long after that period , was liable to be clipped , which occasioned great frauds on the public , and loss to individuals . It is remarkable , that the verses which follow , describing the cypher-like state of royalty , to which the country party wished to reduce the king , agree accurately with what North believed to be Shaftesbury 's real designs upon the authority and person of Charles . “ If he was really a friend to any human kind , besides himself , I believe it was to King Charles the second ; whose gaiety , breeding , wit , good-humour , familiarity , and disposition to enjoy the pleasures of society and greatness , engaged him very much , that had a great share of wit , agreeableness , and gallantry himself . But this same superiority spoiled all ; his majesty would not always be influenced by him , but would take short turns on his toe , and so frustrate his projects ; and finding by that he could not work under him , he strove , if possible , to reduce his authority , and get above him . It seems , by what was given out , that he would not have hurt the king personally , but kept him tame in a cage , with his ordinary pleasures about him . And if he was privy to the cruel stroke intended at the Rye , or any way concurring , it was the necessity of affairs , such as are laws to a politician , and superior to all human engagements , that obliged him . And of that sort , the chief was self-preservation ; for , though he had found the king very easily reconciled , as not being in his nature vindicative , it was possible that humour , as age advanced , might spend ; and he had launched so deep in treason , as it seemed necessary that either the king or he should fall . ” Examen . p. 119 .</p>

    <p n="350">What else inspires the tongues , and swells the breasts , Of all thy bellowing renegado priests .— P . 438 .</p>
    <p n="351">The keen and violent attack made upon the dissenting and fanatical clergy , in these and the following lines , called forth the indignation of the famous Edmund Hickeringill , who had been originally one of Cromwell 's fighting saints , was at this time rector of All-Saints , in Colchester , and was notorious for composing fanatical pamphlets , songs , and sermons .<span corresp="#note511" type="note_anchor">[ 511 ]</span>This reverend gentleman did not let the sun go down without venting his ire ; for , the very next day after the publication of “ The Medal , ” he sent to the press an answer to it , entitled . “ The Mushroom , or a Satire against libelling Tories and prelatical Tantivies ; in answer to a Satire against Sedition , called the Medal , by the author of Absalom and Achitophel ; and here answered by the author of the Black Nonconformist , the next day after the publication of the Medal , to keep the sale thereof . ” To this unintelligible title-page succeeds a prefatory epistle , and a poem almost equally unintelligible , as will appear from a few extracts :</p>
    <p n="352">Epistle to the Tories and Tantivies :</p>
    <p n="353">Instead of an epistle to you Tories , I 'll only preface here with some old stories .</p>
    <p n="354">“ About the year of our Lord 1218 , at Paris , in a synod , or convocation of the clergy , one that was appointed to clerum , or preach the convocation sermon , was put to his trumps , and much troubled in his gizzard what to say or what subject to insist upon . Whereupon the devil , who always catches men napping , and observing the preacher to be melancholy and perplexed in mind , appears to him , as he sat in a brown study , and asked him why he was so careful what to preach ? Say thus , quoth the devil — The princes of hell salute you , O the princes and prelates of the church , and gladly give you thanks , that , through your default and negligence , all souls go to hell , &amp; c. &amp; c. &amp; c . ”</p>
    <p n="355">You call the Popes hard names , bears , wolves , and sherks : For mischief what is then ; the bishop and his clerks , At the land 's end of England ? those dire stones On which ships , men , are lost , body and bones .</p>
    <p n="356">The poem itself begins thus :</p>
    <p n="357">Time was , John Lawreat , when thy pretty muse , Young , plump , and buxome , no man would refuse ; Though thou did'st poorly prostitute her store , And , for vile pence , made her a hackney whore . Against the rules of art , Phœbus is just ; Her former lovers does her now disgust ; And I , that once in private loved her well , Nay , sometimes smiled at her Achitophel , I longed to kiss her kindly , and to greet Her loving airs , so charming , and so sweet : Nay , be not jealous , John , thou hast no cause , This was whilst she within the modest laws Of a true poet kept ; she 's nauseous grown , Thou needs must blush to own her for thine own . If thou has any grace ; she 's poor and spent , So far from witty , that grows impudent . O what a silly do , thou keep'st in vain , About a medal thus to break thy brain ; The ancient Romans , so renowned for wars , Kept medals of their friends and ancestors ; Art thou red-letter bred , of hopes from Rome ; Yet against pictures speak'st , from whence they come ? A satyr once , satyrs could speak ere thine , Why men did blow their nails , could not divine , Nor why they did their porridge blow , was told , One was to make them hot , the other cold : At which news , satyr set up skut and run , As if he had been frighted with a gun ; How would he run from thee , in naked truth , Who blow'st both hot and cold from the same mouth !</p>
    <p n="358">“ The Mushroom ” concludes with the following awful threat ; which , doubtless , must have greatly appalled Dryden :</p>
    <p n="359">I 'll take thy laurells from thee , if I list , An honour to my fairer brow when mist ; ‘ Tis a day thrown away , ( no more ) think I , No more it was , yet — diem perdidi , Unless it be to make thy Satyre fell , And Tonson begged this boon , which some think well . Thy Satyre , three months old , a cripple came This day to hand , I now return it lame . London , March 17 . 1681 .</p>
    <p n="360">The ingenious author tacks to his poem some rants of inimitable nonsense and scurrility in prose , in which he is pleased to intimate , that there is , from the wonderful celerity of its production , some ground for believing , that he himself , the author , had received miraculous aid .</p>
    <p n="361">“ And if any man think or say , that it is a wonder if this book and verses were composed and writ in one day , and sent to the press , since it would employ the pen of a ready writer to copy this book in a day — it may be so .</p>
    <p n="362">“ But it is a truth , as certain and stable as the sun in the firmament , and which , if need be , the bookseller , printer , and other worthy citizens that are privy to it , can avouch for an infallible truth — deo soli gloria — when a divine hand assists , one of despicable , dull , and inconsiderate parts , may do wonders , which God usually performs by most weak and unlikely instruments . ”</p>
    <p n="363">A single extract more may be added , to shew the high popularity of “ Absalom and Achitophel ” among the country gentlemen of England . “ What sport it is to see an old country justice , with his eager chaplain at his elbow , putting his barnacles on his nose ; bless us , how he gapes and admires Nat . Thomson , the addresses in the Gazette , Abhorrences , Heraclitus , or the Observator ! But shew him but — “ Absalom and Achitophel ” — oh — then the man 's horn mad , there 's no holding him ; then he hunts up , and though in his dining-room , how he spends , with double mouth , and whoops and hallows , just as he hunts his dogs when at full cry . “ That — that — that — that — Rattle — Towzer — Bulldog — Thunder — that — that — ” while the little trencher-chaplain echoes to him , and cries , “ Amen . ”</p>

    <p n="365">With which thou flatterest thy decrepid age .— P . 439 .</p>
    <p n="366">Shaftesbury was at this period little above sixty years old . But he was in a state of premature decrepitude ; partly owing to natural feebleness of body , and partly to an injury which he received by an overturn in a Dutch carriage when he was in Holland , in 1660 , as one of the parliamentary committee . He received on this occasion a wound , or bruise in his side , which came to an internal exulceration ; so that in the year 1672 he was opened by Mr Knolls the surgeon , under the direction of Dr Willis , and an issue inserted for the regular discharge of the humour . This one of his biographers has called the “ greatest cure that ever was done on the body of man . "[ 512 ] The royalists forgot the honourable cause in which this injury was received , nothing less than a journey undertaken to invite the king to repossession of his throne , when they made its consequences the subject of scurrilous jests .<span corresp="#note513" type="note_anchor">[ 513 ]</span>Dryden had already called Shaftesbury “ the formidable cripple ; ” and in the Essay of Satire , he sarcastically describes the contrast between the activity of his spirit , and the decrepitude of his person .</p>
    <p n="367">FOOTNOTES :</p>
    <note xml:id="note503" place="bottom" n="503">Blood , famous for his attempt upon the crown jewels , and other ruffian adventures , was at this time a true blue Protestant . “ And here the good Colonel Blood , ( that stole the Duke of Ormond , and , if a timely rescue had not come in , had hanged him at Tyburn , and afterwards stole the crown , though he was not so happy as to carry it off ,) no player at small games ; he , even he , the virtuous colonel , was to have been destroyed by the Papists . It seems these Papists would let no eminent Protestant be safe . But some amends were made ; the colonel , by the sale of the narrative , licensed Thomas Blood . It had been strange if so much mischief had been stirring , and he not come in for a snack . ” — Examen , p. 311 . The narrative is now before me , in which I observe Colonel Blood very feelingly complains , “ that those who are to deal with Jesuits and their disciples , had need to have as well the prudence of serpents , as the innocence of doves . ”</note>
