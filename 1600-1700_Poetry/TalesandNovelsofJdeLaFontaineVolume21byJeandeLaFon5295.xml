    <head>THE SPECTACLES</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I LATELY vowed to leave the nuns alone ,</l>
     <l n="2">So oft their freaks have in my page been shown .</l>
     <l n="3">The subject may at length fatigue the mind ;</l>
     <l n="4">My Muse the veil howe'er is still inclined ,</l>
     <l n="5">Conspicuously to hold to publick view ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , ‘ mong the sisters , scene and scene pursue .</l>
     <l n="7">Is this too much ?— the nicest tricks they play ;</l>
     <l n="8">Through soft amours oft artfully they stray ,</l>
     <l n="9">And these in full I 'd readily detail ,</l>
     <l n="10">If I were sure the subject would not fail ;</l>
     <l n="11">And that 's impossible I must admit ,</l>
     <l n="12">‘ Twould endless be , the tales appear so fit ;</l>
     <l n="13">There 's not a clerk so expeditious found ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who could record the stories known around .</l>
     <l n="15">The sisters to forget , were I to try ,</l>
     <l n="16">Suspicions might arise that , by and by ,</l>
     <l n="17">I should return : some case might tempt my pen ;</l>
     <l n="18">So oft I 've overrun the convent-den ,</l>
     <l n="19">Like one who always makes , from time to time ,</l>
     <l n="20">The conversation with his feelings chime .</l>
     <l n="21">But let us to an end the subject bring ,</l>
     <l n="22">And after this , of other matters sing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">IN former times was introduced a lad</l>
     <l n="24">Among the nuns , and like a maiden clad ;</l>
     <l n="25">A charming girl by all he was believed ;</l>
     <l n="26">Fifteen his age ; no doubts were then conceived ;</l>
     <l n="27">Coletta was the name the youth had brought ,</l>
     <l n="28">And , till he got a beard , was sister thought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">THE period howsoe'er was well employed ,</l>
     <l n="30">And from it Agnes profit had enjoyed ;</l>
     <l n="31">What profit ?— truly better had I said ,</l>
     <l n="32">That sister Agnes by him was misled ,</l>
     <l n="33">And store of ills received ; misfortune dire</l>
     <l n="34">Obliged the nun more girdle to require ,</l>
     <l n="35">And ultimately to produce ( in spite</l>
     <l n="36">Of ev'ry wish to guard the fact from light )</l>
     <l n="37">A little creature that our hist'ries say ,</l>
     <l n="38">Was found Coletta 's features to display .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="39">GREAT scandal quickly through the convent ran :</l>
     <l n="40">How could this child arrive ?— the sisters ‘ gan</l>
     <l n="41">To laugh and ask , if in an evil hour ,</l>
     <l n="42">The mushroom could have fallen with a show'r ?</l>
     <l n="43">Or self-created was it not supposed ?</l>
     <l n="44">Much rage the abbess presently disclosed ;</l>
     <l n="45">To have her holy mansion thus disgraced !</l>
     <l n="46">Forthwith the culprit was in prison placed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">THE father to discover next they tried ;</l>
     <l n="48">How could he enter , pass , escape , or hide ;</l>
     <l n="49">The walls were high ; the grate was double too ;</l>
     <l n="50">Quite small the turning-box appeared to view ,</l>
     <l n="51">And she who managed it was very old :—</l>
     <l n="52">Perhaps some youthful spark has been so bold ,</l>
     <l n="53">Cried she who was superior to the rest ,</l>
     <l n="54">To get admitted , like a maiden dressed ,</l>
     <l n="55">And ‘ mong our flock ( if rightly I surmise )</l>
     <l n="56">A wicked wolf is lurking in disguise .</l>
     <l n="57">Undress , I say , I 'll verify the fact ;</l>
     <l n="58">No other way remains for me to act .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="59">THE lad disguised was terrified to death ;</l>
     <l n="60">Each plan was dissipated with a breath ;</l>
     <l n="61">The more he thought of means from thence to get ,</l>
     <l n="62">The greater were the obstacles he met .</l>
     <l n="63">At length NECESSITY ( the parent found</l>
     <l n="64">Of stratagems and wiles , so much renowned ,)</l>
     <l n="65">Induced the youth . . . ( I scarcely can proceed )</l>
     <l n="66">To tie . . . expression here I clearly need ;</l>
     <l n="67">What word will decently express the thought ?</l>
     <l n="68">What book has got it ?— where should it be sought ?</l>
     <l n="69">You 've heard , in days of yore that human kind ,</l>
     <l n="70">With windows in their bosoms were designed ,</l>
     <l n="71">Through which ‘ twas easy all within to see ,</l>
     <l n="72">And suited those of medical degree .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="73">BUT if these windows useful were believed ;</l>
     <l n="74">‘ Twas inconvenient in the heart perceived ,</l>
     <l n="75">And women thoroughly disliked the scheme :—</l>
     <l n="76">They could not find the means to hide a dream .</l>
     <l n="77">Dame Nature howsoe'er contrived a plan :—</l>
     <l n="78">One lace she gave the woman , one the man ,</l>
     <l n="79">Of equal length , and each enough no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="80">By proper care to shut the ope throughout .</l>
     <l n="81">The woman much too thick her eyelets placed ;</l>
     <l n="82">And consequently , ne'er was closely laced ;</l>
     <l n="83">The fault was all her own : herself the cause ;</l>
     <l n="84">The man as little merited applause ,</l>
     <l n="85">For coarsely working , soon the hole was shut ,</l>
     <l n="86">From which the remnant lace was left to jut ;</l>
     <l n="87">In fact , on either side , whate'er was done ,</l>
     <l n="88">The laces never equally would run ,</l>
     <l n="89">And we are told , both sexes acted wrong :</l>
     <l n="90">The woman 's was too short ; the man 's too long .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="91">FROM this ‘ tis easy , it should seem to guess :</l>
     <l n="92">What by the youth was tied in this distress</l>
     <l n="93">The end of lace that by the men was left ,</l>
     <l n="94">When nature ordered them to close the cleft :</l>
     <l n="95">With thread he fastened it so very well ,</l>
     <l n="96">That all was flat as any nun or belle ;</l>
     <l n="97">But thread or silk , you cannot find a string</l>
     <l n="98">To hold , what soon I fear will give a spring ,</l>
     <l n="99">And get away , in spite of all you do ;</l>
     <l n="100">Bring saints or angels such a scene to view ,</l>
     <l n="101">As twenty nuns in similar array ,</l>
     <l n="102">Strange creatures I should think them :— merely clay ,</l>
     <l n="103">If they should at the sight unmoved remain ;</l>
     <l n="104">I speak of nuns , howe'er , whose charms maintain</l>
     <l n="105">Superior rank , and like the Graces seem ,</l>
     <l n="106">Delightful sisters ! ev'ry way supreme .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="107">THE prioress , this secret to disclose ,</l>
     <l n="108">Appeared with spectacles upon her nose ;</l>
     <l n="109">And twenty nuns around a dress displayed ;</l>
     <l n="110">That convent mantua-makers never made ,</l>
     <l n="111">Imagine to yourself what felt the youth ,</l>
     <l n="112">‘ Mid this examination of the truth .</l>
     <l n="113">The nice proportions and the lily charms</l>
     <l n="114">Soon raised within his bosom dire alarms ;</l>
     <l n="115">Like magick operated on the string ,</l>
     <l n="116">And from it , what was tied , soon gave a spring ;</l>
     <l n="117">Broke loose at once , just like a mettled steed ,</l>
     <l n="118">That , having slipt its halter , flies with speed ;</l>
     <l n="119">Against the abbess ’ nose with force it flew ,</l>
     <l n="120">And spectacles from her proboscis threw .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="121">THOUGH she had nearly fallen on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="122">In thus attempting secrets to explore ,</l>
     <l n="123">No jest she thought the accident , ‘ twas plain ,</l>
     <l n="124">But would with force the discipline maintain .</l>
     <l n="125">A chapter instantly the lady held ;</l>
     <l n="126">Long time upon the circumstance they dwelled .</l>
     <l n="127">The youthful wolf that caused the direful shock ;</l>
     <l n="128">At length was given to the aged flock ,</l>
     <l n="129">Who tied his hands and bound him to a tree</l>
     <l n="130">Face ‘ gainst the wood , that none his front might see ;</l>
     <l n="131">And while the cruel troop , with rage inflamed ,</l>
     <l n="132">Considered of rewards that vengeance framed ;</l>
     <l n="133">While some the besoms from the kitchen brought ;</l>
     <l n="134">And others , in the convent ars'nal sought</l>
     <l n="135">The various instruments the sisters used</l>
     <l n="136">To punish when obedience was refused ;</l>
     <l n="137">Another double-locked , within a room .</l>
     <l n="138">The nuns of tender hearts and youthful bloom :—</l>
     <l n="139">By chance , a friend to sly gallants appeared ,</l>
     <l n="140">And soon removed , what most our hero feared :</l>
     <l n="141">A miller mounted on his mule came by ,</l>
     <l n="142">A tight-built active lad with piercing eye ;</l>
     <l n="143">One much admired by all the girls around ;</l>
     <l n="144">Played well at kayles :— a good companion found .</l>
     <l n="145">Aha ! cried he , what 's here ?— a nice affair ;</l>
     <l n="146">Young man , pray tell me who has placed thee there ?</l>
     <l n="147">The sisters , say'st thou ?— hast thou had thy fun ,</l>
     <l n="148">And pleased thy fancy with a wanton nun ?</l>
     <l n="149">Art satisfied ?— and was she pretty too ?</l>
     <l n="150">In truth , to judge by what appears to view ,</l>
     <l n="151">Thou seemest thoroughly a wily wight ,</l>
     <l n="152">That convent belles would relish morn and night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="153">ALAS ! replied the other with a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="154">In vain the nuns my virtue sought to try ;</l>
     <l n="155">‘ Twas my misfortune :— patience heav'n bestow ;</l>
     <l n="156">For worlds such wickedness I would not know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="157">THE miller laughed at what the other spoke ;</l>
     <l n="158">Untied his hands , and ev'ry bandage broke .</l>
     <l n="159">Said he , thou ninny , scruples can'st thou find</l>
     <l n="160">To counteract , and prove to pleasure blind ?</l>
     <l n="161">The business clearly should to me belong ;</l>
     <l n="162">Our rector ne'er had thought such conduct wrong ,</l>
     <l n="163">And never would have played the fool like this ;</l>
     <l n="164">Fly , haste away , away ; I 'll thee dismiss ,</l>
     <l n="165">First having nicely set me in thy place ;</l>
     <l n="166">Like me thou wert not formed for soft embrace ;</l>
     <l n="167">I 'm stout and able :— quarter ne'er will ask ;</l>
     <l n="168">Come ALL , these nuns , I 'll execute the task ,</l>
     <l n="169">And many pranks they 'll see , unless a freak</l>
     <l n="170">Should happen any way the string to break .</l>
     <l n="171">The other never asked his wishes twice ,</l>
     <l n="172">But tied him well , and left him in a trice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="173">WITH shoulders broad the miller you might see ;</l>
     <l n="174">In Adam 's birth-attire against the tree ,</l>
     <l n="175">Await the coming of the aged band ,</l>
     <l n="176">Who soon appeared , with tapers in the hand ,</l>
     <l n="177">In solemn guise , and whips and scourges dire :</l>
     <l n="178">The virgin troop ( as convent laws require )</l>
     <l n="179">In full procession moved around the Wight ;</l>
     <l n="180">Without allowing time to catch his sight ,</l>
     <l n="181">Or giving notice what they meant to do :</l>
     <l n="182">How now ! cried he :— why wo n't you take a view ?</l>
     <l n="183">Deceived you are ; regard me well I pray ;</l>
     <l n="184">I 'm not the silly fool you had to-day ,</l>
     <l n="185">Who woman hates , and scruples seeks to raise :</l>
     <l n="186">Employ but me , and soon I 'll gain your praise ;</l>
     <l n="187">I 'll wonders execute ; my strength appears ;</l>
     <l n="188">And ; if I fail , at once cut off my ears .</l>
     <l n="189">At certain pleasant play I 'm clever found ;</l>
     <l n="190">But as to whips — I never was renowned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="191">WHAT means the fellow ? cried a toothless nun ;</l>
     <l n="192">What would he tell us ? Hast thou nothing done ?</l>
     <l n="193">How !— Art thou not our brat-begetter ?— speak ;</l>
     <l n="194">So much the worse :— on thee our rage we 'll wreak ,</l>
     <l n="195">For him that 's gone we 'll make thee suffer now ;</l>
     <l n="196">Once arms in hand , we never will allow</l>
     <l n="197">Such characters full punishment to miss ;</l>
     <l n="198">The play that we desire is THIS and THIS ;</l>
     <l n="199">Then whips and scourges round him ‘ gan to move ,</l>
     <l n="200">And not a little troublesome to prove</l>
     <l n="201">The miller , writhing with the poignant smart ,</l>
     <l n="202">Cried loudly :— I 'll exert my utmost art ,</l>
     <l n="203">Good ladies , to perform what is your due ;</l>
     <l n="204">The more he bawled , the faster lashes flew .</l>
     <l n="205">This work so well the aged troop achieved ,</l>
     <l n="206">He long remembered what his skin received .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="207">WHILE thus the master chastisement had got ;</l>
     <l n="208">His mule was feeding on the verdant spot .</l>
     <l n="209">But what became of this or that , at last ,</l>
     <l n="210">I 've never heard , and care not how it past .</l>
     <l n="211">‘ Tis quite enough to save the young gallant ,</l>
     <l n="212">And more particulars we do not want .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="213">My readers , for a time , could they obtain</l>
     <l n="214">A dozen nuns like these , where beauties reign ,</l>
     <l n="215">Would doubtless not be seen without their dress !</l>
     <l n="216">We do not always ev'ry wish express .</l>

    <head>THE BUCKING-TUB</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IF once in love , you 'll soon invention find</l>
     <l n="2">And not to cunning tricks and freaks be blind ;</l>
     <l n="3">The youngest ‘ prentice , when he feels the dart ,</l>
     <l n="4">Grows wondrous shrewd , and studies wily art .</l>
     <l n="5">This passion never , we perceive , remains</l>
     <l n="6">In want from paucity of scheming brains .</l>
     <l n="7">The god of hearts so well exerts his force ,</l>
     <l n="8">That he receives his dues as things of course .</l>
     <l n="9">A bucking-tub , of which a tale is told ,</l>
     <l n="10">Will prove the case , and this I 'll now unfold ;</l>
     <l n="11">Particulars I heard some days ago ,</l>
     <l n="12">From one who seemed each circumstance to know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">WITHIN a country town , no matter where ,</l>
     <l n="14">Its appellation nothing would declare ,</l>
     <l n="15">A cooper and his wife , whose name was Nan ,</l>
     <l n="16">Kept house , and through some difficulties ran .</l>
     <l n="17">Though scanty were their means , LOVE thither flew ;</l>
     <l n="18">And with him brought a friend to take a view ;</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Twas Cuckoldom accompanied the boy ,</l>
     <l n="20">Two gods most intimate , who like to toy ,</l>
     <l n="21">And , never ceremonious , seek to please</l>
     <l n="22">Go where they will , still equally at ease ;</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Tis all for them good lodging , fare , or bed ;</l>
     <l n="24">And , hut or palace , pleasantly they tread .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">IT happened then , a spark this fair caressed ,</l>
     <l n="26">And , when he hoped most fully to be blessed ,</l>
     <l n="27">When all was ready to complete the scene ,</l>
     <l n="28">And on a point :— if naught should intervene</l>
     <l n="29">Not NAMED howe'er will quite enough suffice ,</l>
     <l n="30">When suddenly the husband , by surprise ,</l>
     <l n="31">Returned from drinking at an ale-house near ,</l>

     <l n="33">THEY curst his coming ; trouble o'er them spread ;</l>
     <l n="34">Naught could be done but hide the lover 's head ;</l>
     <l n="35">Beneath a bucking-tub , in utmost haste ,</l>
     <l n="36">Within the court , our gay gallant was placed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">THE husband , as he entered , loudly cried ,</l>
     <l n="38">I 've sold our bucking-tub . The wife replied ,</l>
     <l n="39">What price , I pray ?— Three crowns rejoined the man ;</l>
     <l n="40">Then thou'rt a silly ass , said mistress Nan ;</l>
     <l n="41">To-day , by my address , I 've gained a crown ,</l>
     <l n="42">And sold the same for twenty shillings down :</l>
     <l n="43">My bargain luckily the first was made ;</l>
     <l n="44">The buyer , ( who of flaws is much afraid )</l>
     <l n="45">Examines now if ev'ry part is tight ;</l>
     <l n="46">He 's in the tub to see if all be right .</l>
     <l n="47">What , blockhead , would'st thou do without thy wife ?</l>
     <l n="48">Thou huntest taverns while she works for life ;</l>
     <l n="49">But necessary ‘ tis for her to act ,</l>
     <l n="50">When thou art out , or naught would be exact .</l>
     <l n="51">No pleasure ever yet received have I ;</l>
     <l n="52">But take my word , to get it now I 'll try .</l>
     <l n="53">Gallants are plenty ; husbands should have wives ;</l>
     <l n="54">That , like themselves , lead gay or sober lives .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="55">I PRYTHEE softly , wife , the husband said ;</l>
     <l n="56">Come , come , sir , leave the tub , there 's naught to dread ;</l>
     <l n="57">When you are out , I 'll ev'ry quarter scrape ,</l>
     <l n="58">Then try if water from it can escape ;</l>
     <l n="59">I 'll warrant it to be as good as nice ,</l>

     <l n="61">OUT came the lover ; in the husband went ;</l>
     <l n="62">Scraped here and there , and tried if any vent ;</l>
     <l n="63">With candle in his hand looked round and round ,</l>
     <l n="64">Not dreaming once that LOVE without was found .</l>
     <l n="65">But nothing he could see of what was done ;</l>
     <l n="66">And while the cooper sought to overrun</l>
     <l n="67">The various parts , and by the tub was hid ,</l>
     <l n="68">The gods already noticed thither slid ;</l>
     <l n="69">A job was by the deities proposed ,</l>
     <l n="70">That highly pleased the couple when disclosed ;</l>
     <l n="71">A very diff'rent work from what within</l>
     <l n="72">The husband had , who scraped with horrid din ,</l>
     <l n="73">And rubbed , and scrubbed , and beat so very well ,</l>
     <l n="74">Fresh courage took our gay gallant and belle ;</l>
     <l n="75">They now resumed the thread so sadly lost ,</l>
     <l n="76">When , by the cooper 's coming , all was crossed .</l>

     <l n="80">The artful trick our pair with raptures moved .</l>

    <head>THE IMPOSSIBLE THING</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A DEMON , blacker in his skin than heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">So great a charm was prompted to impart ;</l>
     <l n="3">To one in love , that he the lady gained ,</l>
     <l n="4">And full possession in the end obtained :</l>
     <l n="5">The bargain was , the lover should enjoy</l>
     <l n="6">The belle he wished , and who had proved so coy .</l>
     <l n="7">Said Satan , soon I 'll make her lend an ear ,</l>
     <l n="8">In ev'ry thing more complaisant appear ;</l>
     <l n="9">But then , instead of what thou might'st expect ,</l>
     <l n="10">To be obedient and let me direct ,</l>
     <l n="11">The devil , having thus obliged a friend ,</l>
     <l n="12">He 'll thy commands obey , thou may'st depend ,</l>
     <l n="13">The very moment ; and within the hour</l>
     <l n="14">Thy humble servant , who has got such pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="15">Will ask for others , which at once thou'lt find ;</l>
     <l n="16">Make no delay , for if thou art so blind ,</l>
     <l n="17">Thou comprehend'st , thy body and thy soul</l>
     <l n="18">The lovely fair no longer shall control ,</l>
     <l n="19">But Satan then upon them both shall seize ,</l>
     <l n="20">And with them do-whatever he may please :</l>
     <l n="21">‘ Gainst this the spark had not a word to say ;</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Twas pleasing to command , though not obey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">HE sallied forth the beauteous belle to seek ,</l>
     <l n="24">And found her as he wished :— complying-meek ;</l>
     <l n="25">Indulged in blisses , and most happy proved ,</l>
     <l n="26">Save that the devil always round him moved .</l>
     <l n="27">Whatever rose within the whirl of thought</l>
     <l n="28">He now commanded :— quickly it was brought ;</l>
     <l n="29">And when he ordered palaces to rise ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or raging tempests to pervade the skies ,</l>
     <l n="31">The devil instantly obeyed his will ,</l>
     <l n="32">And what he asked was done with wondrous skill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">LARGE sums his purse received ;— the devil went</l>
     <l n="34">just where commanded , and to Rome was sent ,</l>
     <l n="35">From whence his highness store of pardons got ;</l>
     <l n="36">No journey long , though distant was the spot ,</l>
     <l n="37">But ev'ry thing with magick ease arose ,</l>
     <l n="38">And all was soon accomplished that he chose .</l>
     <l n="39">So oft the spark was asked for orders new ,</l>
     <l n="40">Which he was bound to give the fiend at view ,</l>
     <l n="41">That soon his head most thoroughly was drained ,</l>
     <l n="42">And to the fair our lover much complained ,</l>
     <l n="43">Declared the truth , and ev'ry thing detailed ,</l>
     <l n="44">How he was lost , if in commands he failed .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="45">IS'T this , said she , that makes thee so forlorn ?</l>
     <l n="46">Mere nothing ! - quickly I 'll remove the thorn ;</l>
     <l n="47">When Satan comes , present his highness this ,</l>
     <l n="48">Which I have here , and say :— You will not miss</l>
     <l n="49">To make it flat , and not its curl retain</l>
     <l n="50">On which she gave him , what with little pain</l>
     <l n="51">She drew from covert of the Cyprian grove ,</l>
     <l n="52">The fairy labyrinth where pleasures rove ,</l>
     <l n="53">Which formerly a duke so precious thought ;</l>
     <l n="54">To raise a knightly order thence he sought ,</l>
     <l n="55">Illustrious institution , noble plan ,</l>
     <l n="56">More filled with gods and demi-gods than man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="57">THE lover to the crafty devil said : -</l>
     <l n="58">‘ Tis crooked this , you see , and I am led</l>
     <l n="59">To wish it otherwise ; go , make it straight ;</l>
     <l n="60">A perfect line : no turn , nor twist , nor plait .</l>
     <l n="61">Away to work , be quick , fly , hasten , run ;</l>
     <l n="62">The demon fancied it could soon be done ;</l>
     <l n="63">No time he lost , but set it in the press ,</l>
     <l n="64">And tried to manage it with great success ;</l>
     <l n="65">The massy hammer , kept beneath the deep ,</l>
     <l n="66">Made no impression : he as well might sleep ;</l>
     <l n="67">Howe'er he beat : whatever charm he used :—</l>
     <l n="68">‘ Twas still the same ; obedience it refused .</l>
     <l n="69">His time and labour constantly were lost ;</l>
     <l n="70">Vain proved each effort : mystick skill was crossed ;</l>
     <l n="71">The wind , or rain , or fog , or frost , or snow ,</l>
     <l n="72">Had no effect : still circular ‘ twould go .</l>
     <l n="73">The more he tried , the ringlet less inclined</l>
     <l n="74">To drop the curvature so closely twined .</l>
     <l n="75">How 's this ? said Satan , never have I seen</l>
     <l n="76">Such stubborn stuff wherever I have been ;</l>
     <l n="77">The shades below no demon can produce ,</l>
     <l n="78">That could divine what here would prove of use :</l>
     <l n="79">‘ Twould puzzle hell to break the curling spring ,</l>
     <l n="80">And make a line direct of such a thing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="81">ONE morn the devil to the other went :</l>
     <l n="82">Said he , to give thee up I 'll be content ;</l>
     <l n="83">If solely thou wilt openly declare</l>
     <l n="84">What ‘ tis I hold , for truly I despair ;</l>
     <l n="85">I 'm victus I confess , and can n't succeed :</l>
     <l n="86">No doubt the thing 's impossible decreed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="87">FRIEND Satan , said the lover , you are wrong ;</l>
     <l n="88">Despondency should not to you belong ,</l>
     <l n="89">At least so soon :— what you desire to know</l>
     <l n="90">Is not the only one that 's found to grow ;</l>
     <l n="91">Still many more companions it has got ,</l>
     <l n="92">And others could be taken from the spot .</l>
