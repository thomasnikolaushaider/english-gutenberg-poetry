   <p>NOTES TO VOL . II 329</p>
   <p>LIST OF FIRST LINES 355</p>
   <p>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE .</p>
   <p>Recent inquiries into the life of Henry Vaughan have added but little to the information already contained in the memoirs of Mr. Lyte and Dr. Grosart . I have , however , been enabled to put together a few notes on this somewhat obscure subject , which may be taken as supplementary to Mr. Beeching 's Introduction in Vol . I . It will be well to preface them by reprinting the account of Anthony à Wood , our chief original authority ( Ath . Oxon ., ed . Bliss , 1817 , iv . 425 ):</p>
   <p>“ Henry Vaughan , called the Silurist from that part of Wales whose inhabitants were in ancient times called Silures , brother twin ( but elder )[ 1 ] to Eugenius Philalethes , alias Tho . Vaughan ... was born at Newton S. Briget , lying on the river Isca , commonly called Uske , in Brecknockshire , educated in grammar learning in his own country for six years under one Matthew Herbert , a noted schoolmaster of his time , made his first entry into Jesus College in Mich. term 1638 , aged 17 years ; where spending two years or more in logicals under a noted tutor , was taken thence and designed by his father for the obtaining of some knowledge in the municipal laws at London . But soon after the civil war beginning , to the horror of all good men , he was sent for home , followed the pleasant paths of poetry and philology , became noted for his ingenuity , and published several specimens thereof , of which his Olor Iscanus was most valued . Afterwards applying his mind to the study of physic , became at length eminent in his own country for the practice thereof , and was esteemed by scholars an ingenious person , but proud and humorous .... [ A list of Vaughan 's works follows . ] ... He died in the latter end of April ( about the 29th day ) in sixteen hundred ninety and five , and was buried in the parish church of Llansenfreid , about two miles distant from Brecknock , in Brecknockshire . ”</p>
   <p>Anthony à Wood seems to have had some personal acquaintance with the poet , for in his account of Thomas Vaughan ( Ath . Oxon . iii . 725 ) he says that “ Olor Iscanus sent me a catalogue of his brother 's works . ”</p>
   <p>( a ) THE VAUGHAN GENEALOGY .</p>
   <p>Henry Vaughan 's descent from the Vaughans of Tretower , County Brecon , has been accurately traced by Dr. Grosart and others . Little has been hitherto known about his immediate family . Theophilus Jones , in his History of Brecknockshire ( 1805-9 ) , ii . 544 , says : “ Henry Vaughan died in 1695 , aged 75 ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>leaving by his first wife two sons and three daughters , and by his second a daughter Rachel , who married John Turberville . His grand-daughter , Denys , or Dyenis , a corruption or abbreviation of Dyonisia , who was the daughter of Jenkin Jones of Trebinshwn , by Luce his wife , died single in 1780 , aged 92 , and is buried in the Priory churchyard .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>What became of the remainder of his family , or whether they are extinct , I know not . ” To this statement Mr. Lyte added nothing but some errors , and Dr. Grosart nothing but the following hypothesis :—</p>
   <p>“ I am inclined to think that William Vaughan , censor of the College of Physicians , physician to William III ^ d ., was one of the sons of our worthy mentioned by Mr. Lyte .... William Vaughan 's ‘ age 20 ’ in 1668 represents 1648 as the birth-date , and that fits in with the love-verse of the Poems of 1646 . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. G. T. Clark , in his Genealogies of Glamorgan , p. 240 , gives the following account :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Henry [ Vaughan ] , ob . 1695 , æt . 75 , father by first wife of ( 1 ) a son ,</l>

   <p>Unfortunately Mr. Clark is unable to remember his authority for this pedigree . I have found another , which differs from it in many ways , and is exceedingly interesting , inasmuch as it gives , for the first time , the names of Henry Vaughan 's two wives , who appear to have been sisters . It is in a volume of Brecknockshire Pedigrees collected by the Welsh Herald , Hugh Thomas , and now amongst the Harleian MSS . Hugh Thomas was born and lived hard by Llansantffread , and must have known Vaughan and his family personally .</p>

     <l n="18">It will be observed that neither Mr. Clark 's pedigree nor Hugh Thomas ’</l>
     <l n="19">agrees with the number of children assigned to each marriage by</l>
     <l n="20">Theophilus Jones , and that neither of them helps out Dr. Grosart 's</l>
     <l n="21">hypothesis that Dr. William Vaughan was a son of the poet . Mr. W. B. Rye</l>
     <l n="22">( Genealogist , iii . 33 ) has made it appear likely that this Dr .</l>
     <l n="23">Vaughan , who married Anne Newton , of Romford in Essex , belonged to a</l>
     <l n="24">branch of the Vaughans who had been settled in Romford since 1571 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I now proceed to confirm and illustrate the pedigrees by giving such further facts concerning Vaughan 's immediate family as I have been able with Miss Morgan 's assistance , to glean . I can trace no family of Wises in Staffordshire so early as the seventeenth century , nor any place in that county called Ritsonhall . It is possible that the R. W. of the Elegy ( vol . ii ., p. 79 , note ) may have been a Wise , and also that the connection between Vaughan and the Staffordshire Egertons may have been through this family ( vol . ii ., p. 294 , note ) . Vaughan 's first wife Catharine was probably dead before 1658 . Thomas Vaughan , in his diary ( MS. Sloane , 1741 , f. 106 ( b )) , makes mention in that year of “ eyewater made at the Pinner of Wakefield by my dear wife and my Sister Vaughan , who are both now with God . ” The second wife , Elizabeth , survived her husband . Administration of his goods was granted to her as the widow of an intestate in May , 1695 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>The fine old manor-house at Newton was pulled down by a stupid land-agent within the memory of man , but a stone has been found built into the wall of a house half-a-mile from the site , bearing the inscription “ H ^ VE , 1689 . ” This may well stand for H [ enry and ] E [ lizabeth ] V [ aughan ] . Newton probably passed to the poet 's eldest son Thomas and his wife Frances .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Of their descendants , if any , we know nothing . There was a William Vaughan of Llansantffread who , later than 1714 , married Mary Games of Tregaer in Llanfrynach . But this was probably a Vaughan not of Newton , but of Scethrog , also in Llansantffread ( cf . footnote to p. xxv . below . ) In 1733 William Vaughan was churchwarden of Llanfrynach . In 1740 William Vaughan of Tregaer was high sheriff of Brecknock . In 1760 Tregaer had passed by purchase to a Mr. Phillips . The registers of Llanfrynach from 1695-1756 are now lost . Lucy Greenleafe and her sister Catharine are quite obscure . One of them may have been the niece who was living with Thomas Vaughan when news came from the country in 1658 of his father 's death ( MS. Sloane , 1741 , f. 89 ( b )) . Of the second family , Henry became Rector of Penderin in 1684 , and vacated the living , probably through death , in 1713 . A tablet to his memory hung during the present century in the church at Penderin , but when the church was restored the tablets were taken down and buried under the tiles of the chancel . His wife , a Walbeoffe of Talyllyn , belonged to the same family as the Walbeoffes of Llanhamlach ( vol . ii ., p. 189 , note ) . The eldest girl , Grisill , married Roger Prosser . The Prossers were the younger branch of a Brecknockshire family who had become sadlers and mercers in Brecon . Many of their tombs are in the Priory church , but Theophilus Jones states that by his time they were extinct . Grisill Prosser was married a second time , in 1709 , to Morgan Watkins , an attorney , and was buried on August 21 , 1737 . The second girl , Lucy , married Jenkin Jones of Trebinshwn , a cousin of Colonel Jenkin Jones , the local Parliamentary leader . Her daughter , Denise Jones , died single in 1780 , as Theophilus Jones states , and her tombstone in the Priory church records her descent . The third girl , Rachel , married John Turberville , one of the Turbervilles of Llangattock , who claimed kinship with the Elizabethan poet of that name . The following pedigree shows the descendants of the three daughters of Henry Vaughan 's second marriage , so far as they can be traced .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span></p>
   <p>Henry Vaughan = 2 . Elizabeth Wise . | | | | 1 . Roger = Grisill ...= 2 . Morgan Lucy = Jenkin Rachel = John Prosser ,| Watkins , | Jones , | Turberville Mercer . | Attorney . | of Trebinshwn . | of Llangattock . | | | | | Richard = Mary ——? | | | of Llamwyse | Walter , Elizabeth = Morgan Denise and Glan y | bapt . 1693. bapt . 1686 . | Davies , nat . 1688 , rhyd , ob . | | mercer , o. s. p . 29 1720 . | | ob . 1727 .

   <p>It will be seen that I can give no evidence of the existence of any living descendants of Henry Vaughan .</p>
   <p>Henry 's grandfather , Thomas Vaughan , a younger son of Charles Vaughan of Tretower , seems to have come into the possession of Newton through his marriage with an heiress of the family of Gwillims or Williams . Newton , or in Welsh Trenewydd , is a farm of about 200 acres in the manor or lordship , and near the village of Scethrog , both being in the parish of Llansantffread and hundred of Penkelley . Williams is a common name in Breconshire , and I cannot trace the descent of Thomas Vaughan 's wife . In the sixteenth century Newton belonged to a family who finally settled on the name of Howel , ap Howell or Powell .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>The last of these is described on his tombstone in Llansantffread Church as “ David Morgan David Howel , who married ... William of Llanhamoloch : and they had issue one daughter called Denys . He died 2nd June , 1598 . ” Perhaps Newton passed in some way from David Morgan David Howel to his wife 's family , and so to Thomas Vaughan , who married Denise Gwillims . Theophilus Jones ( ii . 538 ) records that at a later date other Williams 's , also apparently connected with Llanhamlach , were succeeded by other Vaughans at Scethrog , hard by Newton . His account is that David Williams , youngest brother of Sir Thomas Williams of Eltham , married a daughter of John Walbeoffe of Llanhamlach ( cf . pedigree in vol . ii ., p. 189 , note ) , and bought Scethrog . Their son Charles died without issue , and the property passed to his wife Mary ( Anne in Harl . MS ., 2289 , t. 39 ; cf . vol . ii ., p. 204 , note ) , the daughter of Morgan John of Wenallt .... She afterwards married Hugh Powell , clerk , parson of Llansanffread and precentor of St. David 's , and her daughter Margaret married Charles Vaughan , son to Vaughan Morgan of Tretower .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></p>
   <p>A trace of Thomas Vaughan is probably preserved in a window-head from the old church of Llansantffread , now destroyed , which has the inscription :—</p>
   <p>1626 . E. G. T. V. W. T. W. F. I . [ bold reversed ‘ D ’ ] .</p>
   <p>T. V. may stand for T [ homas ] V [ aughan ] .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></p>
   <p>Of Henry Vaughan , the poet 's father , very little is known . His name appears in a list of Breconshire magistrates for 1620 . And we learn from Thomas Vaughan 's diary in Sloane MS. 1741 , f. 89 ( b ) , that he died in August 1658 .</p>
   <p>The only additional definite fact which I can here record of the poet himself is that in 1691 he entered a caveat against any institution to the vicarage of Llandevalley , he claiming the next presentation under a grant from William Winter , Esq .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Mr. Rye has shown that the specimen of handwriting facsimiled by Dr. Grosart in his edition of Henry Vaughan 's Works cannot possibly be the poet 's . The signatures , however , on the margin of a copy of Olor Iscanus , once in the library of Lady Isham , might be genuine .</p>
   <p>( b ) VAUGHAN AND JESUS COLLEGE , OXFORD .</p>
   <p>Anthony à Wood 's statement as to Vaughan 's residence at Jesus College , Oxford , has been generally accepted , but I venture to doubt it on the following grounds :—</p>
   <p>( 1 ) Vaughan 's name does not occur in the University Matriculation Register , although his brother Thomas Vaughan is duly entered as matriculating from Jesus on 14th December , 1638 . The only College records which help us are the Battel-books for 1638 and 1640 . That for 1639 is unfortunately missing . The Rev . Llewellyn Thomas kindly informs me that he can only trace one undergraduate Vaughan in the two books in question . The Christian name is not given , but I think that we must assume it to be Thomas .</p>
   <p>( 2 ) Vaughan does not describe himself on any title-page as of Jesus College ; nor does he ever speak of himself as an Oxford man . This omission is the more noticeable as he would naturally have done so in the lines Ad Posteros ( vol . ii ., p. 51 ) , and might well have done so in those On Sir Thomas Bodley 's Library , the Author being then in Oxford ( vol . ii ., p. 197 ) .</p>
   <p>( 3 ) Anthony à Wood cannot be depended on . He describes Thomas Carew , for instance , as of C. C. C ., whereas he was a most certainly of Merton . And there was another Henry Vaughan of Jesus , who may have been confused with the poet . This Henry Vaughan , a son of John Vaughan of Cathlin , Merionethshire , matriculated at Oriel on July 4 , 1634 . He afterwards became a Scholar and Fellow of Jesus , taking his B. A . in 1637 and his M. A . in 1639 . In 1643 he became vicar of Penteg , co. Monmouth , and died at Abergavenny in 1661 . ( Wood , Ath . Oxon ., iii . 531 ; Foster , Alumni Oxon . )</p>
   <p>( 4 ) The only confirmation of Anthony à Wood 's statement is the poem ( vol . ii ., p. 289 ) taken by Dr. Grosart from the Eucharistica Oxoniensia ( 1641 ) , and signed “ H. Vaughan , Jes . Col . ” If I am right , this may be by Vaughan 's namesake . He has indeed another poem in that volume signed “ Hen . Vaugh ., Jes . Soc . ” but that is in Latin , and it is not unexampled for one man to contribute more than one poem , especially in different tongues , to such collections . Or it may be by Herbert Vaughan , who was a Gentleman-commoner of the College in 1641 , and has , with Henry Vaughan the Fellow , verses in the [ Greek : proteleia ] Anglo Batava of the same year .</p>
   <p>( c ) VAUGHAN IN THE CIVIL WAR .</p>
   <p>There are several passages which make it probable that Vaughan , like his brother Thomas , bore arms on the King 's side in the Civil War . The most important is in the poem To Mr. Ridsley ( vol . ii ., p. 83 ) , where he speaks of the time</p>
   <p>“ when this juggling fate Of soldiery first seiz 'd me . ”</p>
   <p>In the same poem he mentions</p>
   <p>“ that day , when we Left craggy Biston and the fatal Dee . ”</p>
   <p>“ Craggy Biston ” is clearly Beeston Castle , one of the outlying defences of Chester , situated on a steep rock not very far east of the Dee . This castle was besieged on several occasions during the Civil War , especially during the campaign of 1645 , when Chester was also besieged by the Parliamentarians .<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>Between Beeston and the Dee was fought , on September 24 , 1645 , the battle of Rowton Heath , after which Charles the First , who had hoped to raise the siege of Chester , was obliged to retreat to Denbigh .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>The following lines from Vaughan 's Elegy on Mr. R. W. ( vol . ii ., p. 79 ) , who fell in that battle , seem to have been written by an eye-witness :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ O that day</l>
     <l n="2">When like the fathers in the fire and cloud</l>
     <l n="3">I miss 'd thy face ! I might in ev'ry crowd</l>
     <l n="4">See arms like thine , and men advance , but none</l>
     <l n="5">So near to lightning mov 'd , nor so fell on .</l>
     <l n="6">Have you observ 'd how soon the nimble eye</l>
     <l n="7">Brings th ’ object to conceit , and doth so vie</l>
     <l n="8">Performance with the soul , that you would swear</l>
     <l n="9">The act and apprehension both lodg 'd there ?</l>
     <l n="10">Just so mov 'd he : like shot his active hand</l>
     <l n="11">Drew blood , ere well the foe could understand .</l>
     <l n="12">But here I lost him . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This appears to me pretty conclusive evidence ; against it , however , must be set the passage on the Civil War in the autobiographical poem Ad Posteros ( vol . ii ., p. 51 ) .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Vixi , divisos cum fregerat haeresis Anglos</l>
     <l n="2">Inter Tysiphonas presbyteri et populi .</l>
     <l n="3">His primum miseris per amoena furentibus arva</l>
     <l n="4">Prostravit sanctam vilis avena rosam .</l>
     <l n="5">Turbarunt fontes , et fusis pax perit undis ,</l>
     <l n="6">Moestaque coelestes obruit umbra dies .</l>
     <l n="7">Duret ut integritas tamen , et pia gloria , partem</l>
     <l n="8">Me nullam in tanta strage fuisse , scias ;</l>
     <l n="9">Credidimus nempe insonti vocem esse cruori ,</l>
     <l n="10">Et vires quae post funera flere docent .</l>
     <l n="11">Hinc castae , fidaeque pati me more parentis</l>
     <l n="12">Commonui , et lachrimis fata levare meis ;</l>
     <l n="13">Hinc nusquam horrendis violavi sacra procellis ,</l>
     <l n="14">Nec mihi mens unquam , nec manus atra fuit .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The natural interpretation of this certainly is that Vaughan took no share in the disturbances of his time , except to grieve over them in retirement . Yet , in the first place , the lines may have been written before he took up arms in 1645 , and , in the second , they may only mean that he had no share in bringing about the troubles of England , or in shedding innocent blood . Similarly when elsewhere , as in Abel 's Blood ( vol . i. p. 254 ) , and in the prayer to be quoted below , he expresses horror of blood-guiltiness , this need not necessarily be taken as extending to the man who fights in a righteous cause .</p>
   <p>Miss Morgan , I may add , suggests that Vaughan was at Rowton Heath , not as a combatant , but as a physician . The description which he gives of the battle reads like that of a man who saw it from some commanding point of view , but was not himself engaged . I think it not improbable that Vaughan was one of the garrison of Beeston Castle , which is described to me as “ a sort of grand stand for the battle-field . ” Beeston Castle was invested by the Parliamentarians in the course of September 1645 . On the approach of Charles the troops were drawn off on 19th September to Chester .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>Charles no doubt took the opportunity to strengthen the garrison . After Rowton Heath Beeston Castle was again besieged , and on November 16th it surrendered . The garrison were allowed to march across the Dee to Denbigh . I think that this winter ride from the fallen fortress is the one described by Vaughan in the poem to Mr. Ridsley . It is the more probable that Vaughan took part in this campaign of 1645 , in that Charles 's force was largely recruited from Wales . After the battle of Naseby on June 14th , the King had marched through Wales , collecting such levies as he could . He was in Brecon on August 5th .<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>It is quite possible that Vaughan , whose kinsman Sir William Vaughan was in command of a brigade , volunteered on this occasion . From Brecon Charles marched through Radnorshire , Shropshire , Staffordshire , Derbyshire , Nottinghamshire , Yorkshire , and so to Oxford . In September he set out again , and after some delay at Hereford and Raglan , finally made for Chester .</p>
   <p>It is just conceivable that it is to some occasion in this campaign that Vaughan refers when he calls Dr. Powell his “ fellow-prisoner ” ( vol . ii ., p. 178 ) . The poet may even have been the Captain Vaughan whose name appears in the official list of prisoners taken at Rowton Heath .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>Powell 's name is not there , but then the list does not profess to be complete . But on the whole I think that Vaughan and Powell were only fellow-prisoners in the Platonic sense of imprisonment in the flesh , and even if a literal imprisonment is intended , it may have been due to some act of persecution which Vaughan had to suffer as a Royalist at a later date . There is in The Mount of Olives ( 1652 ) a Prayer in Adversity and Troubles occasioned by our Enemies ( Grosart , vol . iii ., p. 75 ) , which , if it is to be taken — I think it is not — as autobiographical , seems to show that , at least for a time , he lost his estate . The prayer runs : “ Thou seest , O God , how furious and implacable mine enemies are : they have not only robbed me of that portion and provision which Thou hast graciously given me , but they have also washed their hands in the blood of my friends , my dearest and nearest relations . I know , O God , and I am daily taught by that disciple whom Thou didst love , that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him . Keep me , therefore , O my God , from the guilt of blood , and suffer me not to stain my soul with the thoughts of recompense and vengeance , which is a branch of Thy great prerogative , and belongs wholly unto Thee . Though they persecute me unto death , and pant after the very dust upon the heads of Thy poor , though they have taken the bread out of Thy children 's mouth , and have made me a desolation ; yet , Lord , give me Thy grace , and such a measure of charity as may fully forgive them . ”</p>
   <p>It may have been during some such time of trouble , or imprisonment , if imprisonment there was , that Vaughan 's wife lived with Thomas Vaughan , as will be seen below , in London .</p>
   <p>( d ) THOMAS VAUGHAN .</p>

     <l n="1">It has not been thought necessary to reprint in this edition of Henry</l>
     <l n="2">Vaughan 's poems the scanty English and Latin verses of his brother ,</l>
     <l n="3">Thomas Vaughan . They may be found , together with verses by Virgil and</l>
     <l n="4">Campion ascribed to him , in vol . ii . of Dr. Grosart 's Fuller Worthies</l>
     <l n="5">edition . But some account of so curious a person will not be out of</l>
     <l n="6">place .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As for his brother , our chief authority is Anthony à Wood ( Ath . Oxon ., iii . 722 ) , who says that he was the son of Thomas Vaughan of Llansantffread ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>that he was born in 1621 , educated under Matthew Herbert and at Jesus College , Oxford , of which he became Fellow , took orders and received [ in 1640 ] the living of Llansanffread from his kinsman , Sir George Vaughan [ of Fallerstone , Wilts ] . He lost his living in the unquiet times of the Civil War , retired to Oxford , and became an eminent chemist , afterwards moving to London , where he worked under the patronage of Sir Robert Murray . He was a great admirer of Cornelius Agrippa , “ a great chymist , a noted son of the fire , an experimental philosopher , a zealous brother of the Rosicrucian fraternity ... neither papist nor sectary , but a true resolute protestant in the best sense of the Church of England . ” In the great plague he fled with Murray from London to Oxford , and thence went to the house of Samuel Kem at Albury , where he died on February 27 , 1665 / 6 , of mercury accidentally getting into his nose while he was operating . He was buried at Albury on March 1st . Writing in 1673 , Anthony à Wood gives a list of his alchemical and mystical treatises published between 1650 and 1655 . Of these he had received a list from Olor Iscanus ( Henry Vaughan ) . They all bear the name of Eugenius Philalethes , except the Aula Lucis ( 1652 ) , which was issued as by S. N ., i. e . [ Thoma ] S [ Vaugha ] N. Some of these pamphlets contain Vaughan 's share of a vigorous and scurrilous controversy with Henry More , the Platonist . Anthony à Wood distinguishes from Vaughan another Eugenius Philalethes , author of the Brief Natural History ( 1669 ) , also one Eirenaeus Philalethes , author of Ripley Redivivus and other works , and Eirenaeus Philoponos Philalethes , author of The Marrow of Alchemy ( 1654-5 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span></p>
   <p>A few facts , from well-known sources , may be added to Anthony à Wood 's account . The University Registers show that “ Thos . Vaughan , son of Thomas of Llansanfraid , co. Brecon , pleb ., matriculated from Jesus College on 14 Dec , 1638 , aged 16 . ” He took his B. A . on 18 Feb ., 1641 / 2 , but does not appear to have taken his M. A ., though he became Fellow of his College ( Foster , Alumni Oxon . ) . John Walker ( Sufferings of the Clergy ( 1714 ) , p. 389 ) states that he was ejected from his living on the charges of “ drunkenness , immorality , and bearing arms for the King . "[ 19 ] This must have been in 1649 , under the Act for the Propagation of the Gospel in Wales . There exists a letter from Thomas Vaughan to a friend in London , dated from “ Newtown , Ash Wednesday , 1653 ;"[ 20 ] and it appears from Jones ’ History of Brecknockshire ( ii ., 542 ) , that at one time he lived with his brother Henry there . The allusions to Henry More , to Murray , and to the Isis and Thames seem to show that he is the Daphnis of his brother 's Eclogue ( vol . ii ., p. 278 ) . No trace of his death or burial can however be now found at Albury . Mr. Gordon Goodwin points out to me that Dr. Samuel Kem was a somewhat notorious character ( Dict . Nat . Biog ., s. v . Kem ): perhaps this friendship , together with the personal confession quoted below , throws light on the charges which lost Vaughan his living . On the other hand Anthony à Wood speaks well of him , and the tone of his writings bears out this more kindly judgment , at any rate so far as his later years are concerned .</p>
   <p>What has been said fairly well exhausted the available information on Thomas Vaughan until a few years ago , when Mr. A. E. Waite discovered in Sloane MS. 1741 a valuable manuscript of his , containing amongst other things a number of autobiographical memoranda . He printed some extracts from this in the preface to an edition of some of The Magical Writings of Thomas Vaughan ( Redway , 1888 ) , and has been kind enough to furnish me with a reference to the MS. itself , which I have carefully examined . It bears the title Aqua Vitae non Vitis , and the inscription “ Ex libris Thomas et Rebecca Vaughan , 1651 , Sept. 28 . Quos Deus coniunxit quis separabit ? ” The contents are partly personal jottings and records of dreams , partly alchemical formulae . They appear to cover the period 1658-1662 . We learn from them the following facts :— Vaughan was married on September 28 , 1651 , to a lady named Rebecca ( f. 106 ( b )) . With her and his “ Sister Vaughan ” he lived and studied alchemy at the Pinner of Wakefield .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>He had previously lodged at Mr. Coalman 's in Holborn ( f. 104 ( b )) . His wife died on Saturday , April 17 , 1658 , and was buried at Mappersall , in Bedfordshire ( f. 106 ( b )) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>In 1658 his father and his brother W. were both dead , and he mentions the news of his father 's death coming to his niece in a letter from the country ( f. 89 ( b )) . On April 9 , 1659 , he saw his brother H. in a dream . On 16 July , 1658 , he was living at Wapping ( f. 103 ( b )) , and at an earlier period at Paddington . There is an inventory of his wife 's goods left at Mrs. Highgate 's , and mention of a Mr. Highgate and a Sir John Underhill ( f. 107 ) . He names his cousin , Mr. J. Walbeoffe , with whom he had some money transactions ( f. 18 ) , and speaks of “ a certain person with whom I had in former times revelled away my years in drinking ” ( f. 103 ) . Perhaps this also was John Walbeoffe , on whom see vol . ii ., p. 189 , note . The alchemical formulae and receipts are interesting . In one place ( f. 12 ) Vaughan announces the discovery of the “ Extract of Oil of Halcaly , ” which he had previously found in his wife 's days and had lost again . This he calls “ the greatest joy I can ever have in this world after her death . ” He seems to have regarded it as the key to an universal solvent . Nearly every receipt is followed by his and his wife 's initials in the form T. R. V. or T. ^ V . R ., and by some expression of devotion to her or of religious piety .</p>
   <p>I now come to the remarkable statements made with respect to Thomas Vaughan in the Mémoires d'une exhYpppHeNPalladiste , now in course of publication by Miss Diana Vaughan . Miss Vaughan is a lady who has created a considerable sensation in Paris . Her own account of herself is that she was brought up as a worshipper of Lucifer , and was for some years a leading spirit amongst certain androgynous lodges of Freemasons , in which the worship of Lucifer is largely practised . She has now , owing to the direct interposition of Joan of Arc , become a Catholic , and has made it her mission to combat Luciferian Freemasonry in every way . Her Memoirs are partly a biography , partly an account of this cult .<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>Miss Vaughan claims to be a great-grand-daughter of Thomas Vaughan 's . She declares him to have been a Luciferian , Grand-master of the Rosicrucian order , and the founder of modern Freemasonry ; and gives an exhaustive account of his career on the authority of family archives . The following paragraphs contain the substance of her narrative , the “ legend of Philalethes , ” as it was told to Miss Vaughan by her father and her uncle , who were intimate friends of Albert Pike .</p>
   <p>The traditional accounts of Thomas Vaughan , says Miss Vaughan , contain serious errors . The dates of his birth and of his death , and the pseudonym under which he wrote are all incorrectly stated<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>( p. 110 ) . He was born in Monmouth in 1612 , being two years the elder of his brother Henry . The two boys were brought up at Oxford , after their father 's death , by their uncle , Robert Vaughan the antiquary ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>and entered at Jesus College ( p. 114 ) . In 1636 , at the age of 24 , Thomas Vaughan went to London , and became the disciple of Robert Fludd , who was a Rosicrucian ( p. 148 ) . The real nature of the Rosicrucians has hitherto been a mystery . They were in reality Luciferians , and carried on in secret during the seventeenth century that warfare against Adonai , the god of the Catholics , out of which had already sprung Wiclif , Luther , and the Reformation , and out of which was some day to spring , more deadly and more dangerous still , Freemasonry . The Fraternity of Rosie-Cross was founded by Faustus Socinus in 1597 . He was succeeded as head of it by Caesar Cremonini ( 1604-1617 ) , Michael Maier ( 1617-1622 ) , Valentin Andreae ( 1622-1654 ) , and Thomas Vaughan ( 1654-1678 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>When Thomas Vaughan first came to London in 1636 , Valentin Andreae was Summus Magister of the Fraternity , and amongst its leading members were Robert Fludd and Amos Komenski , or Comenius ( pp . 129-148 ) . Robert Fludd initiated Thomas Vaughan into the lower degrees of the Golden Cross ( p. 148 ) , and sent him to Andreae at Calw , near Stuttgart , with a letter in which he prophesied for him a miraculous future ( p. 163 ) . After this visit to Germany , Vaughan returned to London , and after Fludd 's death , in 1637 , undertook in 1638 his first visit to America . In many of his writings he speaks as a Christian minister , and at this time he probably passed as a Nonconformist ( p. 164 ) . He was back in London early in June , 1639 ( p. 165 ) , and in the same year visited Denmark , and made a report to Komenski on the mysterious golden horn found at Tondern in that country ( p. 166 ) . In 1640 Vaughan received from Komenski the first initiation of the Rosie Cross , and chose the pseudonym of Eirenaeus Philalethes .<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>He now became exceedingly active , going and coming upon the face of the earth . When in England , he divided his time between Oxford and London ( p. 167 ) . Between 1640 and 1644 he visited Hamburg , the Netherlands , Italy and Sweden ( pp . 171-174 ) . It was at this period that he conceived the design of obtaining a far wider circulation than they had yet met with for the ideas of Faustus Socinus . Some of the Rosicrucians were already “ accepted masons . ” Vaughan determined to capture the vast organization of craft masonry by permeating the lodges with Luciferianism . His associate in this task was Elias Ashmole , with whose aid , a few years later , he composed the degrees of Apprentice ( 1646 ) , Companion ( 1648 ) , and Master ( 1649 ) ( pp . 142 , 169-175 , 197-206 ) . The Civil War had now approached . Oliver Cromwell was a freemason , a Rosicrucian , and a friend of Vaughan 's ( p. 176 ) . With the execution of Laud came the crisis of Vaughan 's life , his initiation into the highest degree of Rosie Cross by the hands of Lucifer himself . It took place in this wise . At the last moment Vaughan was substituted for the intended executioner of Laud .<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>He had prepared a sacramental cloth which he soaked in the martyr 's blood , and on the same night he sacrificed the relic to Lucifer . The divinity appeared , consecrated Vaughan as Magus , named him as the next Summus Magister of the Fraternity , and signed a pact , granting him thirty-three years more life , at the end of which he should be borne away from earth without death ( p. 177 ) . In 1645 Vaughan wrote , but did not yet publish , his most important treatise , the Introitus Apertus ad Occlusum Regis Palatium . In 1645 , still following the direct command of Lucifer , he departed for America . Here he met the apothecary George Starkey , and in his presence performed the alchemical feat of making gold ( p. 179 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>Here , too , he lived amongst the Lenni-Lennaps , where he was united to the demon Venus-Astarte in the form of a beautiful woman , who after eleven days bore him a daughter . This girl was brought up among the Lenni-Lennaps under the name of Diana Wulisso-Waghan , and became Miss Diana Vaughan 's great-great-grandmother ( p. 181 ) . In 1648 Vaughan returned to England , and after composing the masonic degree of Master in 1649 ( p. 197 ) , he began the publication of a series of alchemical and , in reality , Luciferian writings . In 1650 appeared the Anthroposophia Theomagica and the Magia Adamica , in 1651 the Lumen de Lumine ; in 1652 the Aula Lucis ( p. 211 ) . In 1654 Valentin Andreae died , and Vaughan succeeded him as Summus Magister of the Rosie Cross , the event being announced to him by the homage of three demons , Leviathan , Cerberus , and Belphegor ( p. 214 ) . In 1655 he published his Euphrates , and in 1656 made his head-quarters at Amsterdam or Eirenaeopolis . In 1659 came his Fraternity of R. C .; in 1664 his Medulla Alchymiae .<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>In 1666 he exhibited the philosopher 's stone to Helvetius at La Haye and converted him to occultism : in 1667 he at last resolved to publish his Opus Magnum , the Introitus Apertus , already written in 1645 ( p. 215 ) . In 1668 this was followed by the Experimenta de Praeparatione Mercurii Sophici and the Tractatus Tres ( p. 236 ) . The time was now approaching when Vaughan , in fulfilment of the pact of 1644 , must disappear from earth . He named Charles Blount as his successor ( p. 237 ) , and was granted a magical vision of his grandson , the child of Diana Wulisso-Waghan and a Lenni-Lennap ( p. 239 ) . He finished his Memoirs , published the Ripley Revised<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>and the Enarratio Methodica trium Gebri Medicinarum , left his poems to his brother Henry , who published them in the next year as the Thalia Rediviva ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>and on March 25 , 1678 , disappeared in the company of Lucifer Dieu-Bon himself ( p. 240 ) . This event is vouched for , not only by a written statement of Henry Vaughan ( p. 114 ) , but also by the existence in a masonic triangle at Valetta of a magical talisman into which , when properly evoked , the spirit of Philalethes enters and records his glorious end for the edification of the Luciferians present<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>( p. 243 ) .</p>
   <p>I fear that I have taken Miss Vaughan with undue seriousness . Her account of Thomas Vaughan is not only unsupported by direct evidence ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>but much of it is of a character which we should not be justified in accepting , even were direct evidence forthcoming . And it is all discordant with the little that we do happen to know of Thomas Vaughan from other sources . The whole thing is , in fact , a pretty obvious romance of very modern fabrication . It appears to have been compiled from such information as to the alchemical and mystical writers of the seventeenth century as was within the reach of Albert Pike and the brothers Vaughan about the year 1870 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>It is always better to explain than to refute an error ; and the nature of the Luciferian tradition of Thomas Vaughan is pretty clearly shown by the fact that it is not corroborated in a single particular by any of the new facts about him that have come to light since this probable date of its composition .<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>The fabricator put Thomas Vaughan 's birth-place in Monmouth instead of Brecon , because he had never seen Dr. Grosart 's Fuller Worthies Edition of Henry Vaughan . He makes no mention of any of the facts contained in Sloane MS. 1741 , because that MS. was still unknown . And , most fatal of all , he puts Thomas Vaughan 's birth in 1612 instead of 1621-2 , because Foster 's Alumni Oxonienses being yet unpublished , he was ignorant of the record of that date preserved in the University Registers . But we can go a step further . We can confute him , not only by pointing to the books he did not use , but by pointing to those he did . It has already been shown that the ascription to Vaughan of the English translation of Maier 's Themis Aurea is due to a misunderstanding of a phrase used by Anthony à Wood . The Athenae Oxonienses then was one source of the compilation . Another was the Histoire de la Philosophie Hermétique , written by Lenglet-Dufresnoy in 1742 . Here is the proof . Miss Vaughan supports her statement as to the birth-date in 1612 by a quotation from the Introitus Apertus , in which the writer states it to have been composed “ en l'an 1645 de notre salut , et le trente-troisième de mon age . ” This she professes to translate from the editio princeps published by Jean Lange in 1667 . As a matter of fact it is taken from the version given in Lenglet-Dufresnoy 's book . And Lenglet-Dufresnoy followed , not the edition of 1667 , but the later edition published by J. M. Faust at Frankfort in 1706 . In this the words are “ trigesimo tertio , ” whereas in the editio princeps they are “ vicesimo tertio , ” and in W. Cooper 's English translation of 1669 , “ in the 23rd year of my age , ” thus bringing the date of the birth of Eirenaeus Philalethes not to 1612 , but to 1622 . The “ legend of Philalethes ” need detain us no longer . Miss Vaughan 's narrative is a very insufficient basis for regarding the pious minister and mystic which Thomas Vaughan appears to have been as a secret enemy of Christianity and a worshipper of Lucifer .</p>
   <p>But when the legend is set aside , there still remain certain questions suggested by it which may be considered without much reference to the statements of Miss Vaughan . Was Thomas Vaughan a Rosicrucian ? And was he , admittedly the author of a series of tracts under the name of Eugenius Philalethes , also the author of those which bear the name of Eirenaeus Philalethes ? The first question is , I am afraid , insoluble , until it has been decided whether the Fraternity of R. C. ever had an actual existence . Anthony à Wood states that Thomas Vaughan was a zealous Rosicrucian , but probably Anthony à Wood took the term in the general sense of mystic and alchemist . On the other hand Vaughan himself , in his preface to the English translation of the Rosicrucian manifestoes , seems to disavow any personal acquaintance with the members of the fraternity . Even this is not conclusive , for the Rosicrucian rule , as given in the Laws of the Brotherhood , published by Sincerus Renatus in 1710 ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>obliges the members to deny their membership .</p>
   <p>There is more material for the discussion of the second question , but I do not know that it is more possible to come to a definite conclusion . The personality of the anonymous adept who took the name of Eirenaeus Philalethes was shrouded in mystery even to his contemporaries . The fullest account given of him on any of his title-pages is on that of the Experimenta de Praeparatione Mercurii Sophici ( 1668 ) , which is said to be “ ex manuscripto Philosophi Americani alias Eyrenaei Philalethis , natu Angli , habitatione Cosmopolitae . "[ 38 ] We have also the description given by George Starkey , or whoever it was , in the Marrow of Alchemy ( 1654-5 ) , p. 25 . Starkey says :—</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Starkey gives the age of Eirenaeus Philalethes as 33 in 1654 . This precisely confirms the writer 's own statement in the earlier editions of the Introitus Apertus that he was 23 in 1645 , and fixes the birth-date as 1621 or 1622 . Now this agrees remarkably with the birth-date ascertained from other sources of Thomas Vaughan . But Thomas died in 1666 , and it is usually asserted that Eirenaeus Philalethes lived until at least 1678 . Miss Vaughan states that he must have been alive in that year , because he then published the Ripley Revived , and the Enarratio Trium Gebri Medicinarum . She declares that the author of the Enarratio mentions the pains taken about that edition ( p. 240 ) . I do not find any prefatory matter in this book at all . There is a preface to the Ripley Revived , but this was written long before 1678 , for it mentions the Introitus Apertus , published in 1667 , as still in manuscript . Neither Jean Lange , the editor of the Introitus Apertus of 1667 , writing 9th December , 1666 , nor William Cooper , the editor of the English translation<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>of 1669 , writing 15th September , 1668 , know whether the author is still alive . In fact he cannot be shown to have outlived Thomas Vaughan , for there is no proof that the adept who showed the philosopher 's stone to Helvetius on December 27th , 1666 ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>was the same as he who showed it to George Starkey many years before . I will briefly enumerate a few other links which connect Eirenaeus Philalethes with Thomas Vaughan . A German translation of the Introitus Apertus , published at Hamburg under the title of Abyssus Alchemiae ( 1704 ) , is said on the title-page to be “ von T. de Vagan . ” Miss Vaughan states that a similar translation of the first of the Tres Tractatus , published at Hamburg in 1705 , also bears this name ( p. 237 ) , and this is borne out by Lenglet-Dufresnoy ( iii . 261-6 ) , who speaks of a French MS. of the Tres Tractatus inscribed “ par Thomas de Vagan , dit Philalèthe ou Martin Birrhius . ” Birrhius , however , was only the editor . These ascriptions are probably made on the authority of G. W. Wedelius , who in his preface , dated 2nd Sept ., 1698 , to an edition of the Introitus Apertus , published at Jena in 1699 , says of the author :— “ Ex Anglia tamen vulgo habetur oriundus ... et Thomas De Vagan appellatus . ” The English Three Tracts ( 1694 ) are stated on the title-page to have been written in Latin by Eirenaeus Philalethes ; but there is a note in the British Museum Catalogue to the effect that the Latin original has the name Eugenius Philalethes . Unfortunately this Latin Tres Tractatus , published in 1668 by Martin Birrhius at Amsterdam , is not in the Library , and I cannot verify the statement . Finally , I may note that the Ripley Revived ( 1678 ) has an engraved title-page by Robert Vaughan , who also did the title-page to Olor Iscanus , and that Starkey 's Marrow of Alchemy contains , at the end of the preface to Part ii ., some lines by William Sampson , which mention</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">clearly an allusion to More 's controversy with Thomas Vaughan .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It will be seen that there is some primâ facie evidence for identifying Eirenaeus Philalethes with Thomas Vaughan , whereas he was probably not George Starkey ( Eirenaeus Philoponos Philalethes ) , and cannot be shown to have been anyone else . But I am not satisfied . We do not know that Thomas Vaughan was ever in America , and there is the strong evidence of Anthony à Wood , who distinguishes between Eirenaeus and Eugenius , and who appears to have had information from Henry Vaughan himself . Mr. A. E. Waite argues against the identification on the ground that Eirenaeus Philalethes was a “ physical alchemist , ” whereas Thomas Vaughan 's alchemy was spiritual and mystical . But we have Vaughan 's authority for saying that he had pursued the physical alchemy also .<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>And he was clearly doing so when he wrote Sloane MS. 1741 . A more pertinent objection is perhaps that Eirenaeus Philalethes appears to have been in possession of the grand secret when he wrote the Introitus Apertus in 1645 , whereas Thomas Vaughan was still seeking it in 1658 . To pursue the matter further would require a wide knowledge of the alchemical writings of the seventeenth century , which unfortunately I do not possess .<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span></p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>An entire literature has grown up in Paris during the last year around the question whether the cultus of Lucifer is practised in certain Masonic Lodges . A number of Catholic journalists and pamphleteers assert very categorically that this is the case , that the centre of this cultus , containing the full Luciferian initiates , is the 33 ^ rd ^ degree of a so-called New and Reformed Palladian Rite , having its head-quarters at Charlestown , and that the chiefs of this Rite have obtained a controlling influence over the whole of Freemasonry . The creed is described as Manichaean in character , with Lucifer as Dieu-Bon and Adonai , the God of the Catholics , as Dieu-Mauvais . Adonai is the principle of asceticism , Lucifer of natural humanity and la joie de vivre . The rituals and the accepted interpretation of the Masonic symbolism used in the lodges , or “ triangles , ” are of a phallic type . Women are admitted to membership . Immorality , a parody of the Eucharist , known as the black mass , and the practice of black magic , take place at the meetings . Lucifer is worshipped in the form of Baphomet , but from time to time he is personally evoked , and manifested to his followers . Luciferianism tends to become identical with Satanism , in which Lucifer and Satan are identified and frankly worshipped as evil . The first mention of Luciferian Freemasonry was in the Y-a-t-il des Femmes dans la Franc Maçonnerie ? ( 1891 ) , of the somewhat notorious Leo Taxil . But the case rests mainly on the alleged revelations of writers who claim to have themselves been members of the Palladian Rite . The chief of these are Dr. Hacke or Bataille , Signor Margiotta and Miss Diana Vaughan . Unfortunately very little evidence is forthcoming as to the identity of any of these personages . Many leading Masons , e. g ., M. Papus in his Le Diable et l'Occultisme , deny that Luciferian Freemasonry exists at all , and it is freely stated ( cf . Light for 27 June and 4 July , 1896 , pp . 305 , 322 ) that Miss Diana Vaughan is a myth , and that her Mémoires with the rest of the revelations are the ingenious concoction of a band of irresponsible journalists of whom Leo Taxil is the chief . No one appears to have seen Miss Vaughan , and she is alleged to be hiding in some convent from the vengeance of the Luciferians . Probably there will be some further light thrown on the matter before long : in the meantime a good summary of the evidence up-to-date may be found in A. E. Waite 's Devil-Worship in France ( 1896 ) . Assuming that Luciferianism really exists , I do not for a moment believe that it has the antiquity which Miss Vaughan claims for it . The various Rites of modern Freemasonry , with their fantastic and high-sounding degrees , are comparatively recent excrescences upon the original Craft Masonry . The New and Reformed Palladian Rite is said to have been founded at Charlestown by the well-known Mason , Albert Pike , in 1870 . It is based on the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite , which dates from the beginning of the century . If there is such a thing as Luciferianism , I do not think we need look further back than 1870 for its origin . As expounded by Miss Vaughan and others , it is pretty clearly a compilation from Eliphaz Levi and other occultist and Cabbalistic writers , with a good deal of modern American Spiritualism thrown in . Albert Pike , a man of considerable learning , could easily have invented it . Masonic symbolism lends itself readily enough to a wide range of interpretations . I do not say that seventeenth-century occultism has left no traces upon Freemasonry which modern ritual-mongers may have elaborated ; but it is a far cry from this to the belief that Thomas Vaughan and Luther were Manichaean worshippers of Lucifer and Protestantism an organized warfare on Adonai .</p>

But she ascribes to him the Anthroposophia Theomagica and other writings which are signed , though she does not mention it , Eugenius Philalethes ( p. 211 ) . She quotes from Anthony à Wood the assertion , which he does not make , that the English translations of the Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis ( 1652 ) and of Maier 's Themis Aurea ( 1656 ) both bear the name of Eugenius , and were by another Thomas Vaughan ! The manuscripts of both are , she says , signed Eirenaeus ( p. 163 ) . What Wood says is that he has seen a translation of Maier 's tract , dedicated to Elias Ashmole by [ N. L .]/[ T. S .] H. S ., and that Ashmole has forgotten whose the initials are . He does not suggest that this translation is by a Thomas Vaughan . ( Ath . Oxon ., iii . 724 . )</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>Miss Vaughan refers to several family documents , but does not offer them for inspection . They include ( a ) the will of her grandfather James , enumerating the proofs of his descent ( p. 111 ) ; ( b ) the autobiographical Memoirs of Philalethes , from which Miss Vaughan quotes largely ( pp . 174 , 240 ) ; ( c ) a letter from Fludd to Andreae ( pp . 114 , 149 ) ; ( d ) a MS. of the Introitus Apertus , of which the margin has been covered by Vaughan with a comment for Luciferian initiates ( pp . 111 , 217 , 225 ) ; ( e ) a letter from Andreae in the archives of the Sovereign Patriarchal Council of Hamburg ( p. 197 ) ; ( f ) Henry Vaughan 's account of his brother 's disappearance in the archives of the Supreme Dogmatic Directory of Charleston ( p. 114 ) ; ( g ) Masonic rituals in the archives of Masonic chapters at Bristol and Gibraltar ( p. 200 ) ; ( h ) Rosicrucian rituals drawn up by one Nick Stone in the hands of Dr. W. W. W [ estcott ] of London ( p. 141 ) . The documents in Masonic hands are presumably , like the Valetta talisman , now out of Miss Vaughan 's reach . A communication signed Q. V. in Light for May 16 , 1896 , denies , on Dr. Westcott 's authority , that his rituals have anything to do with Nick Stone , or that Miss Vaughan ever saw them . Dr. Westcott is the head of the modern Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia . This body does not even pretend to be the Fraternity of R. C. Finally , there is ( i ) Thomas Vaughan 's original pact with Lucifer , now , according to Miss Vaughan , in holy hands , and to be destroyed on the day she takes the veil .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>Miss Vaughan somewhat naïvely gives us a lead . After describing Thomas Vaughan 's sojourn with Venus-Astarte among the Lenni-Lennaps , she adds : “ This legend is not accepted by all the Elect Mages ; there are those who regard it as fabricated by my grandfather James of Boston , who was , they believe , of Delaware origin , or , at any rate , a half-breed ; and they even assert that , in the desire to Anglicize himself , he invented an entirely false genealogy , by way of justifying his change of the Lennap name Waghan into Vaughan . Herein the opponents of the Luciferian legend of Thomas Vaughan go too far ” ( p. 181 ) .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>I have already pointed out that Miss Vaughan is quite possibly a myth . But , if she exists , I do not see any reason to suppose that she personally invented the “ legend of Philalethes . ” It lies between Leo Taxil and his friends in 1895 , and the alleged founders of Palladism in or about 1870 , that is Albert Pike and Miss Vaughan 's father and uncle . And , so far as it goes , the ignorance shown in the legend of all books published in the last twenty years is evidence for the earlier date , and therefore , to some extent , for the actual existence of Luciferianism .</p>

    <head>TO ALL INGENIOUS LOVERS OF POESY .</head>
     <l n="1">Gentlemen ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To you alone , whose more refined spirits out-wing these dull times , and soar above the drudgery of dirty intelligence , have I made sacred these fancies : I know the years , and what coarse entertainment they afford poetry . If any shall question that courage that durst send me abroad so late , and revel it thus in the dregs of an age , they have my silence : only ,</p>
   <p>Languescente seculo , liceat ægrotari .</p>
   <p>My more calm ambition , amidst the common noise , hath thus exposed me to the world : you have here a flame , bright only in its own innocence , that kindles nothing but a generous thought : which though it may warm the blood , the fire at highest is but Platonic ; and the commotion , within these limits , excludes danger . For the satire , it was of purpose borrowed to feather some slower hours ; and what you see here is but the interest : it is one of his whose Roman pen had as much true passion for the infirmities of that state , as we should have pity to the distractions of our own : honest — I am sure — it is , and offensive cannot be , except it meet with such spirits that will quarrel with antiquity , or purposely arraign themselves . These indeed may think that they have slept out so many centuries in this satire and are now awakened ; which , had it been still Latin , perhaps their nap had been everlasting . But enough of these ,— it is for you only that I have adventured thus far , and invaded the press with verse ; to whose more noble indulgence I shall now leave it , and so am gone .—</p>

     <l n="1">When we are dead , and now , no more</l>
     <l n="2">Our harmless mirth , our wit , and score</l>
     <l n="3">Distracts the town ; when all is spent</l>

     <l n="5">Thy purse , or mine ; when the loath 'd noise</l>
     <l n="6">Of drawers , ‘ prentices and boys</l>
     <l n="7">Hath left us , and the clam'rous bar</l>
     <l n="8">Items no pints i ’ th ’ Moon or Star ;</l>
     <l n="9">When no calm whisp'rers wait the doors ,</l>
     <l n="10">To fright us with forgotten scores ;</l>
     <l n="11">And such aged long bills carry ,</l>
     <l n="12">As might start an antiquary ;</l>
     <l n="13">When the sad tumults of the maze ,</l>
     <l n="14">Arrests , suits , and the dreadful face</l>
     <l n="15">Of sergeants are not seen , and we</l>
     <l n="16">No lawyers ’ ruffs , or gowns must fee :</l>
     <l n="17">When all these mulcts are paid , and I</l>

     <l n="19">We 'll beg the world would be so kind ,</l>
     <l n="20">To give 's one grave as we 'd one mind ;</l>
     <l n="21">There , as the wiser few suspect ,</l>
     <l n="22">That spirits after death affect ,</l>
     <l n="23">Our souls shall meet , and thence will they ,</l>
     <l n="24">Freed from the tyranny of clay ,</l>
     <l n="25">With equal wings , and ancient love</l>
     <l n="26">Into the Elysian fields remove ,</l>
     <l n="27">Where in those blessèd walks they 'll find</l>
     <l n="28">More of thy genius , and my mind .</l>
     <l n="29">First , in the shade of his own bays ,</l>
     <l n="30">Great Ben they 'll see , whose sacred lays</l>
     <l n="31">The learnèd ghosts admire , and throng</l>
     <l n="32">To catch the subject of his song .</l>
     <l n="33">Then Randolph in those holy meads ,</l>
     <l n="34">His Lovers and Amyntas reads ,</l>
     <l n="35">Whilst his Nightingale , close by ,</l>
     <l n="36">Sings his and her own elegy .</l>
     <l n="37">From thence dismiss 'd , by subtle roads ,</l>
     <l n="38">Through airy paths and sad abodes ,</l>
     <l n="39">They 'll come into the drowsy fields</l>
     <l n="40">Of Lethe , which such virtue yields ,</l>
     <l n="41">That , if what poets sing be true ,</l>
     <l n="42">The streams all sorrow can subdue .</l>
     <l n="43">Here , on a silent , shady green ,</l>
     <l n="44">The souls of lovers oft are seen ,</l>
     <l n="45">Who , in their life 's unhappy space ,</l>
     <l n="46">Were murder 'd by some perjur 'd face .</l>
     <l n="47">All these th ’ enchanted streams frequent ,</l>
     <l n="48">To drown their cares , and discontent ,</l>
     <l n="49">That th ’ inconstant , cruel sex</l>
     <l n="50">Might not in death their spirits vex .</l>
     <l n="51">And here our souls , big with delight</l>
     <l n="52">Of their new state , will cease their flight :</l>
     <l n="53">And now the last thoughts will appear ,</l>
     <l n="54">They 'll have of us , or any here ;</l>
     <l n="55">But on those flow'ry banks will stay ,</l>
     <l n="56">And drink all sense and cares away .</l>
     <l n="57">So they that did of these discuss ,</l>

     <l n="21">Whose warmth , help 'd by your tears , shall bring</l>
     <l n="22">O'er all the tomb a sudden spring</l>
     <l n="23">Of crimson flowers , whose drooping heads</l>
     <l n="24">Shall curtain o'er their mournful beds :</l>
     <l n="25">And on each leaf , by Heaven 's command ,</l>
     <l n="26">These emblems to the life shall stand</l>
     <l n="27">Two hearts , the first a shaft withstood ;</l>
     <l n="28">The second , shot and wash 'd in blood ;</l>
     <l n="29">And on this heart a dew shall stay ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which no heat can court away ;</l>
     <l n="31">But fix 'd for ever , witness bears</l>
     <l n="32">That hearty sorrow feeds on tears .</l>
     <l n="33">Thus Heaven can make it known , and true</l>

     <l n="13">The careless ranks of flowers that spread</l>
     <l n="14">Their perfum 'd bosoms to his head .</l>
     <l n="15">And with an open , free embrace ,</l>

    <head>A RHAPSODIS :</head>
    <head>Occasionally written upon a meeting with some of his friends at the Globe Tavern , in a chamber painted overhead with a cloudy sky and some few dispersed stars , and on the sides with landscapes , hills , shepherds and sheep .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Darkness , and stars i ’ th ’ mid-day ! They invite</l>
     <l n="2">Our active fancies to believe it night :</l>
     <l n="3">For taverns need no sun , but for a sign ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where rich tobacco and quick tapers shine ;</l>
     <l n="5">And royal , witty sack , the poet 's soul ,</l>
     <l n="6">With brighter suns than he doth gild the bowl ;</l>
     <l n="7">As though the pot and poet did agree ,</l>
     <l n="8">Sack should to both illuminator be .</l>
     <l n="9">That artificial cloud , with its curl 'd brow ,</l>

     <l n="12">In silent glances o'er the hills , and speak</l>
     <l n="13">The evening to the plains , where , shot from far ,</l>
     <l n="14">They meet in dumb salutes , as one great star .</l>
     <l n="15">The room , methinks , grows darker ; and the air</l>
     <l n="16">Contracts a sadder colour , and less fair .</l>
     <l n="17">Or is't the drawer 's skill ? hath he no arts</l>
     <l n="18">To blind us so we can n't know pints from quarts ?</l>
     <l n="19">No , no , ‘ tis night : look where the jolly clown</l>
     <l n="20">Musters his bleating herd and quits the down .</l>
     <l n="21">Hark ! how his rude pipe frets the quiet air ,</l>
     <l n="22">Whilst ev'ry hill proclaims Lycoris fair .</l>
     <l n="23">Rich , happy man ! that canst thus watch and sleep ,</l>
     <l n="24">Free from all cares , but thy wench , pipe and sheep !</l>

     <l n="26">Sentinel o'er the door , drawn by the hands</l>
     <l n="27">Of some base painter , that for gain hath made</l>
     <l n="28">Her face the landmark to the tippling trade .</l>
     <l n="29">This cup to her , that to Endymion give ;</l>

     <l n="32">No other colours than his fiery nose ;</l>
     <l n="33">And may we no more of his pencil see</l>
     <l n="34">Than two churchwardens , and mortality .</l>
     <l n="35">Should we go now a-wand'ring , we should meet</l>

     <l n="38">Sign-posts and shop-doors , pimp for ev'ry knave ,</l>
     <l n="39">When riotous sinful plush , and tell-tale spurs</l>
     <l n="40">Walk Fleet Street and the Strand , when the soft stirs</l>
     <l n="41">Of bawdy , ruffled silks , turn night to day ;</l>
     <l n="42">And the loud whip and coach scolds all the way ;</l>
     <l n="43">When lust of all sorts , and each itchy blood</l>
     <l n="44">From the Tower-wharf to Cymbeline , and Lud ,</l>

     <l n="49">Look big as mine : the gallant , jolly beast</l>
     <l n="50">Of all the herd — you 'll say — was not the least .</l>

     <l n="28">Or if we poets prophets be —</l>
     <l n="29">From hence transplanted , thou shalt stand</l>
     <l n="30">A fresh grove in th ’ Elysian land ;</l>
     <l n="31">Where — most bless 'd pair !— as here on earth</l>
     <l n="32">Thou first didst eye our growth , and birth ;</l>
     <l n="33">So there again , thou'lt see us move</l>
     <l n="34">In our first innocence and love ;</l>
     <l n="35">And in thy shades , as now , so then ,</l>
     <l n="36">We 'll kiss , and smile , and walk again .</l>

    <head>JUVENAL 'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED .</head>
     <l n="1">In all the parts of earth , from farthest West ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the Atlantic Isles , unto the East</l>
     <l n="3">And famous Ganges , few there be that know</l>
     <l n="4">What 's truly good , and what is good , in show ,</l>
     <l n="5">Without mistake : for what is't we desire ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or fear discreetly ? to whate'er aspire ,</l>
     <l n="7">So throughly bless 'd , but ever as we speed ,</l>
     <l n="8">Repentance seals the very act , and deed ?</l>
     <l n="9">The easy gods , mov 'd by no other fate</l>
     <l n="10">Than our own pray'rs , whole kingdoms ruinate ,</l>
     <l n="11">And undo families : thus strife , and war</l>
     <l n="12">Are the sword 's prize , and a litigious bar</l>
     <l n="13">The gown 's prime wish . Vain confidence to share</l>
     <l n="14">In empty honours and a bloody care</l>
     <l n="15">To be the first in mischief , makes him die</l>
     <l n="16">Fool 'd ‘ twixt ambition and credulity .</l>
     <l n="17">An oily tongue with fatal , cunning sense ,</l>
     <l n="18">And that sad virtue ever , eloquence ,</l>
     <l n="19">Are th ’ other 's ruin , but the common curse ;</l>
     <l n="20">And each day 's ill waits on the rich man 's purse ;</l>
     <l n="21">He , whose large acres and imprison 'd gold</l>
     <l n="22">So far exceeds his father 's store of old ,</l>
     <l n="23">As British whales the dolphins do surpass .</l>
     <l n="24">In sadder times therefore , and when the laws</l>
     <l n="25">Of Nero 's fiat reign 'd , an armèd band</l>
     <l n="26">Seiz 'd on Longinus , and the spacious land</l>
     <l n="27">Of wealthy Seneca , besieg 'd the gates</l>
     <l n="28">Of Lateranus , and his fair estate</l>
     <l n="29">Divided as a spoil : in such sad feasts</l>
     <l n="30">Soldiers — though not invited — are the guests .</l>
     <l n="31">Though thou small pieces of the blessèd mine</l>
     <l n="32">Hast lodg 'd about thee , travelling in the shine</l>
     <l n="33">Of a pale moon , if but a reed doth shake ,</l>
     <l n="34">Mov 'd by the wind , the shadow makes thee quake .</l>
     <l n="35">Wealth hath its cares , and want has this relief ,</l>
     <l n="36">It neither fears the soldier nor the thief ;</l>
     <l n="37">Thy first choice vows , and to the gods best known ,</l>
     <l n="38">Are for thy stores ’ increase , that in all town</l>
     <l n="39">Thy stock be greatest , but no poison lies</l>
     <l n="40">I ’ th ’ poor man 's dish ; he tastes of no such spice .</l>
     <l n="41">Be that thy care , when , with a kingly gust ,</l>
     <l n="42">Thou suck'st whole bowls clad in the gilded dust</l>
     <l n="43">Of some rich mineral , whilst the false wine</l>
     <l n="44">Sparkles aloft , and makes the draught divine .</l>
     <l n="45">Blam'st thou the sages , then ? because the one</l>
     <l n="46">Would still be laughing , when he would be gone</l>
     <l n="47">From his own door ; the other cried to see</l>
     <l n="48">His times addicted to such vanity ?</l>
     <l n="49">Smiles are an easy purchase , but to weep</l>
     <l n="50">Is a hard act ; for tears are fetch 'd more deep .</l>
     <l n="51">Democritus his nimble lungs would tire</l>
     <l n="52">With constant laughter , and yet keep entire</l>
     <l n="53">His stock of mirth , for ev'ry object was</l>
     <l n="54">Addition to his store ; though then — alas !—</l>
     <l n="55">Sedans , and litters , and our Senate gowns ,</l>
     <l n="56">With robes of honour , fasces , and the frowns</l>
     <l n="57">Of unbrib 'd tribunes were not seen ; but had</l>
     <l n="58">He liv 'd to see our Roman prætor clad</l>
     <l n="59">In Jove 's own mantle , seated on his high</l>
     <l n="60">Embroider 'd chariot ‘ midst the dust and cry</l>
     <l n="61">Of the large theatre , loaden with a crown ,</l>
     <l n="62">Which scarce he could support — for it would down ,</l>
     <l n="63">But that his servant props it — and close by</l>
     <l n="64">His page , a witness to his vanity :</l>
     <l n="65">To these his sceptre and his eagle add ,</l>
     <l n="66">His trumpets , officers , and servants clad</l>
     <l n="67">In white and purple ; with the rest that day ,</l>
     <l n="68">He hir 'd to triumph , for his bread , and pay ;</l>
     <l n="69">Had he these studied , sumptuous follies seen ,</l>
     <l n="70">‘ Tis thought his wanton and effusive spleen</l>
     <l n="71">Had kill 'd the Abderite , though in that age</l>
     <l n="72">— When pride and greatness had not swell 'd the stage</l>
     <l n="73">So high as ours — his harmless and just mirth</l>
     <l n="74">From ev'ry object had a sudden birth .</l>
     <l n="75">Nor was't alone their avarice or pride ,</l>
     <l n="76">Their triumphs or their cares he did deride ;</l>
     <l n="77">Their vain contentions or ridiculous fears ,</l>
     <l n="78">But even their very poverty and tears .</l>
     <l n="79">He would at Fortune 's threats as freely smile</l>
     <l n="80">As others mourn ; nor was it to beguile</l>
     <l n="81">His crafty passions ; but this habit he</l>
     <l n="82">By nature had , and grave philosophy .</l>
     <l n="83">He knew their idle and superfluous vows ,</l>
     <l n="84">And sacrifice , which such wrong zeal bestows ,</l>
     <l n="85">Were mere incendiaries ; and that the gods ,</l>
     <l n="86">Not pleas 'd therewith , would ever be at odds .</l>
     <l n="87">Yet to no other air , nor better place</l>
     <l n="88">Ow 'd he his birth , than the cold , homely Thrace ;</l>
     <l n="89">Which shows a man may be both wise and good ,</l>
     <l n="90">Without the brags of fortune , or his blood .</l>
     <l n="91">But envy ruins all : what mighty names</l>
     <l n="92">Of fortune , spirit , action , blood , and fame ,</l>
     <l n="93">Hath this destroy 'd ? yea , for no other cause</l>
     <l n="94">Than being such ; their honour , worth and place ,</l>
     <l n="95">Was crime enough ; their statues , arms and crowns</l>
     <l n="96">Their ornaments of triumph , chariots , gowns ,</l>
     <l n="97">And what the herald , with a learnèd care ,</l>
     <l n="98">Had long preserv 'd , this madness will not spare .</l>
     <l n="99">So once Sejanus ’ statue Rome allow 'd</l>
     <l n="100">Her demi-god , and ev'ry Roman bow 'd</l>
     <l n="101">To pay his safety 's vows ; but when that face</l>
     <l n="102">Had lost Tiberius once , its former grace</l>
     <l n="103">Was soon eclips 'd ; no diff'rence made — alas !—</l>
     <l n="104">Betwixt his statue then , and common brass ,</l>
     <l n="105">They melt alike , and in the workman 's hand</l>
     <l n="106">For equal , servile use , like others stand .</l>
     <l n="107">Go , now fetch home fresh bays , and pay new vows</l>
     <l n="108">To thy dumb Capitol gods ! thy life , thy house ,</l>
     <l n="109">And state are now secur 'd : Sejanus lies</l>
     <l n="110">I ’ th ’ lictors ’ hands . Ye gods ! what hearts and eyes</l>
     <l n="111">Can one day 's fortune change ? the solemn cry</l>
     <l n="112">Of all the world is , “ Let Sejanus die ! ”</l>
     <l n="113">They never lov 'd the man , they swear ; they know</l>
     <l n="114">Nothing of all the matter , when , or how ,</l>
     <l n="115">By what accuser , for what cause , or why ,</l>
     <l n="116">By whose command or sentence he must die .</l>
     <l n="117">But what needs this ? the least pretence will hit ,</l>
     <l n="118">When princes fear , or hate a favourite .</l>
     <l n="119">A large epistle stuff 'd with idle fear ,</l>
     <l n="120">Vain dreams , and jealousies , directed here</l>
     <l n="121">From Caprea does it ; and thus ever die</l>
     <l n="122">Subjects , when once they grow prodigious high .</l>
     <l n="123">‘ Tis well , I seek no more ; but tell me how</l>
     <l n="124">This took his friends ? no private murmurs now ?</l>
     <l n="125">No tears ? no solemn mourner seen ? must all</l>
     <l n="126">His glory perish in one funeral ?</l>
     <l n="127">O still true Romans ! State-wit bids them praise</l>
     <l n="128">The moon by night , but court the warmer rays</l>
     <l n="129">O ’ th ’ sun by day ; they follow fortune still ,</l>
     <l n="130">And hate or love discreetly , as their will</l>
     <l n="131">And the time leads them . This tumultuous fate</l>
     <l n="132">Puts all their painted favours out of date .</l>
     <l n="133">And yet this people that now spurn , and tread</l>
     <l n="134">This mighty favourite 's once honour 'd head ,</l>
     <l n="135">Had but the Tuscan goddess , or his stars</l>
     <l n="136">Destin 'd him for an empire , or had wars ,</l>
     <l n="137">Treason , or policy , or some higher pow'r</l>
     <l n="138">Oppress 'd secure Tiberius ; that same hour</l>
     <l n="139">That he receiv 'd the sad Gemonian doom ,</l>
     <l n="140">Had crown 'd him emp'ror of the world and Rome</l>
     <l n="141">But Rome is now grown wise , and since that she</l>
     <l n="142">Her suffrages , and ancient liberty</l>
     <l n="143">Lost in a monarch 's name , she takes no care</l>
     <l n="144">For favourite or prince ; nor will she share</l>
     <l n="145">Their fickle glories , though in Cato 's days</l>
     <l n="146">She rul 'd whole States and armies with her voice .</l>
     <l n="147">Of all the honours now within her walls ,</l>
     <l n="148">She only dotes on plays and festivals .</l>
     <l n="149">Nor is it strange ; for when these meteors fall ,</l>
     <l n="150">They draw an ample ruin with them : all</l>
     <l n="151">Share in the storm ; each beam sets with the sun ,</l>
     <l n="152">And equal hazard friends and flatt'rers run .</l>
     <l n="153">This makes , that circled with distractive fear</l>
     <l n="154">The lifeless , pale Sejanus ’ limbs they tear ,</l>
     <l n="155">And lest the action might a witness need ,</l>
     <l n="156">They bring their servants to confirm the deed ;</l>
     <l n="157">Nor is it done for any other end ,</l>
     <l n="158">Than to avoid the title of his friend .</l>
     <l n="159">So falls ambitious man , and such are still</l>
     <l n="160">All floating States built on the people 's will :</l>
     <l n="161">Hearken all you ! whom this bewitching lust</l>
     <l n="162">Of an hour 's glory , and a little dust</l>
     <l n="163">Swells to such dear repentance ! you that can</l>
     <l n="164">Measure whole kingdoms with a thought or span !</l>
     <l n="165">Would you be as Sejanus ? would you have ,</l>
     <l n="166">So you might sway as he did , such a grave ?</l>
     <l n="167">Would you be rich as he ? command , dispose ,</l>
     <l n="168">All acts and offices ? all friends and foes ?</l>
     <l n="169">Be generals of armies and colleague</l>
     <l n="170">Unto an emperor ? break or make a league ?</l>
     <l n="171">No doubt you would ; for both the good and bad</l>
     <l n="172">An equal itch of honour ever had .</l>
     <l n="173">But O ! what state can be so great or good ,</l>
     <l n="174">As to be bought with so much shame and blood ?</l>
     <l n="175">Alas ! Sejanus will too late confess</l>
     <l n="176">‘ Twas only pride and greatness made him less :</l>
     <l n="177">For he that moveth with the lofty wind</l>
     <l n="178">Of Fortune , and Ambition , unconfin 'd</l>
     <l n="179">In act or thought , doth but increase his height ,</l>
     <l n="180">That he may loose it with more force and weight ;</l>
     <l n="181">Scorning a base , low ruin , as if he</l>
     <l n="182">Would of misfortune make a prodigy .</l>
     <l n="183">Tell , mighty Pompey , Crassus , and O thou</l>
     <l n="184">That mad'st Rome kneel to thy victorious brow ,</l>
     <l n="185">What but the weight of honours , and large fame</l>
     <l n="186">After your worthy acts , and height of name ,</l>
     <l n="187">Destroy 'd you in the end ? The envious Fates ,</l>
     <l n="188">Easy to further your aspiring States ,</l>
     <l n="189">Us 'd them to quell you too ; pride , and excess .</l>
     <l n="190">In ev'ry act did make you thrive the less .</l>
     <l n="191">Few kings are guilty of grey hairs , or die</l>
     <l n="192">Without a stab , a draught , or treachery .</l>
     <l n="193">And yet to see him , that but yesterday</l>
     <l n="194">Saw letters first , how he will scrape , and pray ;</l>
     <l n="195">And all her feast-time tire Minerva 's ears</l>
     <l n="196">For fame , for eloquence , and store of years</l>
     <l n="197">To thrive and live in ; and then lest he dotes ,</l>
     <l n="198">His boy assists him with his box and notes .</l>
     <l n="199">Fool that thou art ! not to discern the ill</l>
     <l n="200">These vows include ; what , did Rome 's consul kill</l>
     <l n="201">Her Cicero ? what , him whose very dust</l>
     <l n="202">Greece celebrates as yet ; whose cause , though just ,</l>
     <l n="203">Scarce banishment could end ; nor poison save</l>
     <l n="204">His free-born person from a foreign grave ?</l>
     <l n="205">All this from eloquence ! both head and hand</l>
     <l n="206">The tongue doth forfeit ; petty wits may stand</l>
     <l n="207">Secure from danger , but the nobler vein</l>
     <l n="208">With loss of blood the bar doth often stain .</l>

     <l n="83">But Babylon this madness can allay ,</l>
     <l n="84">And give the great man but his length of clay .</l>
     <l n="85">The highest thoughts and actions under heaven</l>
     <l n="86">Death only with the lowest dust lays even .</l>
     <l n="87">It is believed — if what Greece writes be true —</l>
     <l n="88">That Xerxes with his Persian fleet did hew</l>
     <l n="89">Their ways through mountains , that their sails full blown</l>
     <l n="90">Like clouds hung over Athos and did drown</l>
     <l n="91">The spacious continent , and by plain force</l>
     <l n="92">Betwixt the mount and it , made a divorce ;</l>
     <l n="93">That seas exhausted were , and made firm land ,</l>
     <l n="94">And Sestos joined unto Abydos strand ;</l>
     <l n="95">That on their march his Medes but passing by</l>
     <l n="96">Drank thee , Scamander , and Melenus dry ;</l>
     <l n="97">With whatsoe'er incredible design</l>
     <l n="98">Sostratus sings , inspir 'd with pregnant wine .</l>
     <l n="99">But what 's the end ? He that the other day</l>
     <l n="100">Divided Hellespont , and forc 'd his way</l>
     <l n="101">Through all her angry billows , that assign 'd</l>
     <l n="102">New punishments unto the waves , and wind ,</l>
     <l n="103">No sooner saw the Salaminian seas</l>
     <l n="104">But he was driven out by Themistocles ,</l>
     <l n="105">And of that fleet — supposed to be so great ,</l>
     <l n="106">That all mankind shar 'd in the sad defeat —</l>
     <l n="107">Not one sail sav 'd , in a poor fisher 's boat ,</l>
     <l n="108">Chas 'd o'er the working surge , was glad to float ,</l>
     <l n="109">Cutting his desp'rate course through the tir 'd flood ,</l>
     <l n="110">And fought again with carcases , and blood .</l>
     <l n="111">O foolish mad Ambition ! these are still</l>
     <l n="112">The famous dangers that attend thy will .</l>
     <l n="113">Give store of days , good Jove , give length of years ,</l>
     <l n="114">Are the next vows ; these with religious fears</l>
     <l n="115">And constancy we pay ; but what 's so bad</l>
     <l n="116">As a long , sinful age ? what cross more sad</l>
     <l n="117">Than misery of years ? how great an ill</l>
     <l n="118">Is that which doth but nurse more sorrow still ?</l>
     <l n="119">It blacks the face , corrupt and dulls the blood ,</l>
     <l n="120">Benights the quickest eye , distastes the food ,</l>
     <l n="121">And such deep furrows cuts i ’ th ’ checker 'd skin</l>
     <l n="122">As in th ’ old oaks of Tabraca are seen .</l>
     <l n="123">Youth varies in most things ; strength , beauty , wit ,</l>
     <l n="124">Are several graces ; but where age doth hit</l>
     <l n="125">It makes no difference ; the same weak voice ,</l>
     <l n="126">And trembling ague in each member lies :</l>
     <l n="127">A general hateful baldness , with a curs 'd</l>
     <l n="128">Perpetual pettishness ; and , which is worst ,</l>
     <l n="129">A foul , strong flux of humours , and more pain</l>
     <l n="130">To feed , than if he were to nurse again ;</l>
     <l n="131">So tedious to himself , his wife , and friends ,</l>
     <l n="132">That his own sons , and servants , wish his end .</l>
     <l n="133">His taste and feeling dies ; and of that fire</l>
     <l n="134">The am'rous lover burns in , no desire :</l>
     <l n="135">Or if there were , what pleasure could it be ,</l>
     <l n="136">Where lust doth reign without ability ?</l>
     <l n="137">Nor is this all : what matters it , where he</l>
     <l n="138">Sits in the spacious stage ? who can nor see ,</l>
     <l n="139">Nor hear what 's acted , whom the stiller voice</l>
     <l n="140">Of spirited , wanton airs , or the loud noise</l>
     <l n="141">Of trumpets cannot pierce ; whom thunder can</l>
     <l n="142">But scarce inform who enters , or what man</l>
     <l n="143">He personates , what ‘ tis they act , or say ?</l>
     <l n="144">How many scenes are done ? what time of day ?</l>
     <l n="145">Besides that little blood his carcase holds</l>
     <l n="146">Hath lost<span type="note_anchor">[ 53 ]</span>its native warmth , and fraught with colds</l>
     <l n="147">Catarrhs , and rheums , to thick black jelly turns ,</l>
     <l n="148">And never but in fits and fevers burns .</l>
     <l n="149">Such vast infirmities , so huge a stock</l>
     <l n="150">Of sickness and diseases to him flock ,</l>
     <l n="151">That Hyppia ne'er so many lovers knew ,</l>
     <l n="152">Nor wanton Maura ; physic never slew</l>
     <l n="153">So many patients , nor rich lawyers spoil</l>
     <l n="154">More wards and widows ; it were lesser toil</l>
     <l n="155">To number out what manors and domains</l>
     <l n="156">Licinius ’ razor purchas 'd : one complains</l>
     <l n="157">Of weakness in the back , another pants</l>
     <l n="158">For lack of breath , the third his eyesight wants ;</l>
     <l n="159">Nay , some so feeble are , and full of pain ,</l>
     <l n="160">That infant-like they must be fed again .</l>
     <l n="161">These faint too at their meals ; their wine they spill ,</l>
     <l n="162">And like young birds , that wait the mother 's bill ,</l>
     <l n="163">They gape for meat ; but sadder far than this</l>
     <l n="164">Their senseless ignorance and dotage is ;</l>
     <l n="165">For neither they , their friends , nor servants know ,</l>
     <l n="166">Nay , those themselves begot , and bred up too ,</l>
     <l n="167">No longer now they 'll own ; for madly they</l>
     <l n="168">Proscribe them all , and what , on the last day ,</l>
     <l n="169">The misers cannot carry to the grave</l>
     <l n="170">For their past sins , their prostitutes must have .</l>
     <l n="171">But grant age lack 'd these plagues : yet must they see</l>
     <l n="172">As great , as many : frail mortality ,</l>
     <l n="173">In such a length of years , hath many falls ,</l>
     <l n="174">And deads a life with frequent funerals .</l>
     <l n="175">The nimblest hour in all the span can steal</l>
     <l n="176">A friend , or brother from 's ; there 's no repeal</l>
     <l n="177">In death , or time ; this day a wife we mourn ,</l>
     <l n="178">To-morrow 's tears a son ; and the next urn</l>
     <l n="179">A sister fills . Long-livers have assign 'd</l>
     <l n="180">These curses still , that with a restless mind ,</l>
     <l n="181">An age of fresh renewing cares they buy ,</l>
     <l n="182">And in a tide of tears grow old and die .</l>
     <l n="183">Nestor ,— if we great Homer may believe —</l>
     <l n="184">In his full strength three hundred years did live :</l>
     <l n="185">Happy — thou'lt say — that for so long a time</l>
     <l n="186">Enjoy 'd free nature , with the grape and wine</l>
     <l n="187">Of many autumns ; but , I prithee thee , hear</l>
     <l n="188">What Nestor says himself , when he his dear</l>
     <l n="189">Antilochus had lost ; how he complains</l>
     <l n="190">Of life 's too large extent , and copious pains ?</l>
     <l n="191">Of all he meets , he asks what is the cause</l>
     <l n="192">He liv 'd thus long ; for what breach of their laws</l>
     <l n="193">The gods thus punish 'd him ? what sin had he</l>
     <l n="194">Done worthy of a long life 's misery .</l>
     <l n="195">Thus Peleus his Achilles mourned , and he</l>
     <l n="196">Thus wept that his Ulysses lost at sea .</l>
     <l n="197">Had Priam died before Phereclus ’ fleet</l>
     <l n="198">Was built , or Paris stole the fatal Greek ,</l>
     <l n="199">Troy had yet stood , and he perhaps had gone</l>
     <l n="200">In peace unto the lower shades ; his son</l>
     <l n="201">Sav 'd with his plenteous offspring , and the rest</l>
     <l n="202">In solemn pomp bearing his fun'ral chest .</l>
     <l n="203">But long life hinder 'd this : unhappy he ,</l>
     <l n="204">Kept for a public ruin , liv 'd to see</l>
     <l n="205">All Asia lost , and ere he could aspire ,</l>
     <l n="206">In his own house saw both the sword and fire ;</l>
     <l n="207">All white with age and cares , his feeble arm</l>
     <l n="208">Had now forgot the war ; but this alarm</l>
     <l n="209">Gathers his dying spirits ; and as we</l>
     <l n="210">An aged ox worn out with labour see</l>
     <l n="211">By his ungrateful master , after all</l>
     <l n="212">His years of toil , a thankless victim fall :</l>
     <l n="213">So he by Jove 's own altar ; which shows we</l>
     <l n="214">Are nowhere safe from heaven , and destiny :</l>
     <l n="215">Yet died a man ; but his surviving queen ,</l>
     <l n="216">Freed from the Greekish sword , was barking seen .</l>
     <l n="217">I haste to Rome , and Pontus ’ king let pass ,</l>
     <l n="218">With Lydian Cr [ oe ] sus , whom in vain — alas !—</l>
     <l n="219">Just Solon 's grave advice bad to attend ,</l>
     <l n="220">That happiness came not before the end .</l>
     <l n="221">What man more bless 'd in any age to come</l>
     <l n="222">Or past , could Nature show the world , or Rome ,</l>
     <l n="223">Than Marius was ? if amidst the pomp of war ,</l>
     <l n="224">And triumphs fetch 'd with Roman blood from far ,</l>
     <l n="225">His soul had fled ; exile and fetters then</l>
     <l n="226">He ne'er had seen , nor known Minturna 's fen ;</l>
     <l n="227">Nor had it , after Carthage got , been said</l>
     <l n="228">A Roman general had begg 'd his bread .</l>
     <l n="229">Thus Pompey th ’ envious gods , and Rome 's ill stars</l>
     <l n="230">— Freed from Campania 's fevers , and the wars —</l>
     <l n="231">Doom 'd to Achilles ’ sword : our public vows</l>
     <l n="232">Made Cæsar guiltless ; but sent him to lose</l>
     <l n="233">His head at Nile : this curse Cethegus miss 'd :</l>
     <l n="234">This Lentulus , and this made him resist</l>
     <l n="235">That mangled by no lictor 's axe , fell dead</l>
     <l n="236">Entirely Catiline , and sav 'd his head .</l>
     <l n="237">The anxious matrons , with their foolish zeal ,</l>
     <l n="238">Are the last votaries , and their appeal</l>
     <l n="239">Is all for beauty ; with soft speech , and slow ,</l>
     <l n="240">They pray for sons , but with a louder vow</l>
     <l n="241">Commend a female feature : all that can</l>
     <l n="242">Make woman pleasing now they shift , and scan</l>
     <l n="243">And when<span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>reprov 'd , they say , Latona 's pair</l>
     <l n="244">The mother never thinks can be too fair .</l>
     <l n="245">But sad Lucretia warns to wish no face</l>
     <l n="246">Like hers : Virginia would bequeath her grace</l>
     <l n="247">To crook-back Rutila in exchange ; for still</l>
     <l n="248">The fairest children do their parents fill</l>
     <l n="249">With greatest cares ; so seldom chastity</l>
     <l n="250">Is found with beauty ; though some few there be</l>
     <l n="251">That with a strict , religious care contend</l>
     <l n="252">Th ’ old , modest , Sabine customs to defend :</l>
     <l n="253">Besides , wise Nature to some faces grants</l>
     <l n="254">An easy blush , and where she freely plants</l>
     <l n="255">A less instruction serves : but both these join 'd ,</l>
     <l n="256">At Rome would both be forc 'd or else purloin 'd .</l>
     <l n="257">So steel 'd a forehead Vice hath , that dares win ,</l>
     <l n="258">And bribe the father to the children 's sin ;</l>
     <l n="259">But whom have gifts defiled not ? what good face</l>
     <l n="260">Did ever want these tempters ? pleasing grace</l>
     <l n="261">Betrays itself ; what time did Nero mind</l>
     <l n="262">A coarse , maim 'd shape ? what blemish 'd youth confin 'd</l>
     <l n="263">His goatish pathic ? whence then flow these joys</l>
     <l n="264">Of a fair issue ? whom these sad annoys</l>
     <l n="265">Wait , and grow up with ; whom perhaps thou'lt see</l>
     <l n="266">Public adulterers , and must be</l>
     <l n="267">Subject to all the curses , plagues , and awe</l>
     <l n="268">Of jealous madmen , and the Julian law ;</l>
     <l n="269">Nor canst thou hope they 'll find a milder star ,</l>
     <l n="270">Or more escapes than did the god of war .</l>
     <l n="271">But worse than all , a jealous brain confines</l>
     <l n="272">His fury to no law ; what rage assigns</l>
     <l n="273">Is present justice : thus the rash sword spills</l>
     <l n="274">This lecher 's blood ; the scourge another kills .</l>
     <l n="275">But thy spruce boy must touch no other face</l>
     <l n="276">Than a patrician ? is of any race</l>
     <l n="277">So they be rich ; Servilia is as good ,</l>
     <l n="278">With wealth , as she that boasts Iulus ’ blood .</l>
     <l n="279">To please a servant all is cheap ; what thing</l>
     <l n="280">In all their stock to the last suit , and king ,</l>
     <l n="281">But lust exacts ? the poorest whore in this</l>
     <l n="282">As generous as the patrician is .</l>
     <l n="283">But thou wilt say what hurt 's a beauteous skin</l>
     <l n="284">With a chaste soul ? Ask Theseus ’ son , and him</l>
     <l n="285">That Stenob [ oe ] a murder 'd ; for both these</l>
     <l n="286">Can tell how fatal ‘ twas in them to please .</l>
     <l n="287">A woman 's spleen then carries most of fate ,</l>
     <l n="288">When shame and sorrow aggravate her hate .</l>
     <l n="289">Resolve me now , had Silius been thy son ,</l>
     <l n="290">In such a hazard what should he have done ?</l>
     <l n="291">Of all Rome 's youth , this was the only best ,</l>
     <l n="292">In whom alone beauty and worth did rest .</l>
     <l n="293">This Messalina saw , and needs he must</l>
     <l n="294">Be ruin 'd by the emp'ror , or her lust .</l>
     <l n="295">All in the face of Rome , and the world 's eye</l>
     <l n="296">Though Cæsar 's wife , a public bigamy</l>
     <l n="297">She dares attempt ; and that the act might bear</l>
     <l n="298">More prodigy , the notaries appear ,</l>
     <l n="299">And augurs to't ; and to complete the sin</l>
     <l n="300">In solemn form , a dowry is brought in .</l>
     <l n="301">All this — thou'lt say — in private might have pass 'd</l>
     <l n="302">But she 'll not have it so ; what course at last ?</l>
     <l n="303">What should he do ? If Messaline be cross 'd ,</l>
     <l n="304">Without redress thy Silius will be lost ;</l>
     <l n="305">If not , some two days ’ length is all he can</l>
     <l n="306">Keep from the grave ; just so much as will span</l>
     <l n="307">This news to Hostia , to whose fate he owes</l>
     <l n="308">That Claudius last his own dishonour knows .</l>
     <l n="309">But he obeys , and for a few hours ’ lust</l>
     <l n="310">Forfeits that glory should outlive his dust ;</l>
     <l n="311">Nor was it much a fault ; for whether he</l>
     <l n="312">Obey 'd or not , ‘ twas equal destiny .</l>
     <l n="313">So fatal beauty is , and full of waste .</l>
     <l n="314">That neither wanton can be safe , nor chaste .</l>
     <l n="315">What then should man pray for ? what is't that he</l>
     <l n="316">Can beg of Heaven , without impiety ?</l>
     <l n="317">Take my advice : first to the gods commit</l>
     <l n="318">All cares ; for they things competent and fit</l>
     <l n="319">For us foresee ; besides , man is more dear</l>
     <l n="320">To them than to himself ; we blindly here ,</l>
     <l n="321">Led by the world and lust , in vain assay</l>
     <l n="322">To get us portions , wives and sons ; but they</l>
     <l n="323">Already know all that we can intend ,</l>
     <l n="324">And of our children 's children see the end .</l>
     <l n="325">Yet that thou may'st have something to commend</l>
     <l n="326">With thanks unto the gods for what they send ;</l>
     <l n="327">Pray for a wise and knowing soul ; a sad ,</l>
     <l n="328">Discreet , true valour , that will scorn to add</l>
     <l n="329">A needless horror to thy death ; that knows</l>
     <l n="330">‘ Tis but a debt which man to nature owes ;</l>
     <l n="331">That starts not at misfortunes , that can sway</l>
     <l n="332">And keep all passions under lock and key ;</l>
     <l n="333">That covets nothing , wrongs none , and prefers</l>
     <l n="334">An honest want , before rich injurers .</l>
     <l n="335">All this thou hast within thyself , and may</l>
     <l n="336">Be made thy own , if thou wilt take the way ;</l>
     <l n="337">What boots the world 's wild , loose applause ? what [ can ]</l>
     <l n="338">Frail , perilous honours add unto a man ?</l>
     <l n="339">What length of years , wealth , or a rich fair wife ?</l>
     <l n="340">Virtue alone can make a happy life .</l>
     <l n="341">To a wise man nought comes amiss : but we</l>
     <l n="342">Fortune adore , and make our deity .</l>

   <p>It is a position anciently known , and modern experience hath allowed it for a sad truth , that absence and time ,— like cold weather , and an unnatural dormition — will blast and wear out of memory the most endearing obligations ; and hence it was that some politicians in love have looked upon the former of these two as a main remedy against the fondness of that passion . But for my own part , my Lord , I shall deny this aphorism of the people , and beg leave to assure your Lordship , that , though these reputed obstacles have lain long in my way , yet neither of them could work upon me : for I am now — without adulation — as warm and sensible of those numerous favours and kind influences received sometimes from your Lordship , as I really was at the instant of fruition . I have no plot by preambling thus to set any rate upon this present address , as if I should presume to value a return of this nature equal with your Lordship 's deserts , but the design is to let you see that this habit I have got of being troublesome flows from two excusable principles , gratitude and love . These inward counsellors — I know not how discreetly — persuaded me to this attempt and intrusion upon your name , which if your Lordship will vouchsafe to own as the genius to these papers , you will perfect my hopes , and place me at my full height . This was the aim , my Lord , and is the end of this work , which though but a pazzarello to the voluminose insani , yet as jessamine and the violet find room in the bank as well as roses and lilies , so happily may this , and — if shined upon by your Lordship — please as much . To whose protection , sacred as your name and those eminent honours which have always attended upon it through so many generations , I humbly offer it , and remain in all numbers of gratitude ,</p>

    <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER .</head>
    <head>It was the glorious Maro that referred his legacies to the fire , and though princes are seldom executors , yet there came a Cæsar to his testament , as if the act of a poet could not be repealed but by a king . I am not , Reader , Augustus vindex : here is no royal rescue , but here is a Muse that deserves it . The Author had long ago condemned these poems to obscurity , and the consumption of that further fate which attends it . This censure gave them a gust of death , and they have partly known that oblivion which our best labours must come to at last . I present thee then not only with a book , but with a prey , and in this kind the first recoveries from corruption . Here is a flame hath been sometimes extinguished , thoughts that have been lost and forgot , but now they break out again like the Platonic reminiscency . I have not the Author 's approbation to the fact , but I have law on my side , though never a sword . I hold it no man 's prerogative to fire his own house . Thou seest how saucy I am grown , and it thou dost expect I should commend what is published , I must tell thee , I cry no Seville oranges . I will not say , Here is fine or cheap : that were an injury to the verse itself , and to the effects it can produce . Read on , and thou wilt find thy spirit engaged : not by the deserts of what we call tolerable , but by the commands of a pen that is above it .</head>

     <l n="10">Poet by voice and suffrage of the shire ;</l>
     <l n="11">That were enough to make my Muse advance</l>

     <l n="1">When Daphne 's lover here first wore the bays ,</l>

     <l n="3">And holy Orpheus , Nature 's busy child ,</l>
     <l n="4">By headlong Hebrus his deep hymns compil 'd ;</l>
     <l n="5">Soft Petrarch — thaw 'd by Laura 's flames — did weep</l>

     <l n="8">Doth murmur Sidney 's Stella to her streams ;</l>
     <l n="9">While Severn , swoln with joy and sorrow , wears</l>
     <l n="10">Castara 's smiles mix 'd with fair Sabrin 's tears .</l>
     <l n="11">Thus poets — like the nymphs , their pleasing themes —</l>
     <l n="12">Haunted the bubbling springs and gliding streams ;</l>
     <l n="13">And happy banks ! whence such fair flow'rs have sprung ,</l>
     <l n="14">But happier those where they have sat and sung !</l>
     <l n="15">Poets — like angels — where they once appear</l>

     <l n="17">Adds rev'rence to't , such as at length doth give</l>
     <l n="18">This aged faith , that there their genii live .</l>
     <l n="19">Hence th ’ ancients say , that from this sickly air</l>
     <l n="20">They pass to regions more refin 'd and fair ,</l>

     <l n="29">I 'll leave behind me such a large , kind light ,</l>
     <l n="30">As shall redeem thee from oblivious night ,</l>
     <l n="31">And in these vows which — living yet — I pay ,</l>

     <l n="41">Where laid men shall more fair truths see</l>
     <l n="42">Than fictions were of Thessaly !</l>

     <l n="59">And where the wand'ring crystal treads</l>
     <l n="60">Roses shall kiss , and couple heads !</l>
     <l n="61">The factor-wind from far shall bring</l>

     <l n="64">Spend it in spicy whispers there .</l>
     <l n="65">No sullen heats , nor flames that are</l>
     <l n="66">Offensive , and canicular ,</l>
     <l n="67">Shine on thy sands , nor pry to see</l>
     <l n="68">Thy scaly , shading family ,</l>

     <l n="33">A bed of roses I 'll provide for thee ,</l>
     <l n="34">And crystal springs shall drop thee melody .</l>
     <l n="35">The breathing shades we 'll haunt , where ev'ry leaf</l>
     <l n="36">Shall whisper us asleep , though thou art deaf .</l>
     <l n="37">Those waggish nymphs , too , which none ever yet</l>
     <l n="38">Durst make love to , we 'll teach the loving fit ;</l>
     <l n="39">We 'll suck the coral of their lips , and feed</l>
     <l n="40">Upon their spicy breath , a meal at need :</l>
     <l n="41">Rove in their amber-tresses , and unfold</l>
     <l n="42">That glist'ring grove , the curled wood of gold ;</l>
     <l n="43">Then peep for babies , a new puppet play ,</l>
     <l n="44">And riddle what their prattling eyes would say .</l>
     <l n="45">But here thou must remember to dispurse ,</l>
     <l n="46">For without money all this is a curse .</l>
     <l n="47">Thou must for more bags call , and so restore</l>
     <l n="48">This iron age to gold , as once before .</l>
     <l n="49">This thou must do , and yet this is not all ,</l>
     <l n="50">For thus the poet would be still in thrall ,</l>
     <l n="51">Thou must then — if live thus — my nest of honey</l>
     <l n="52">Cancel old bonds , and beg to lend more money .</l>

    <head>TO HIS FRIEND ——</head>
     <l n="1">I wonder , James , through the whole history</l>
     <l n="2">Of ages , such entails of poverty</l>
     <l n="3">Are laid on poets ; lawyers — they say — have found</l>
     <l n="4">A trick to cut them ; would they were but bound</l>
     <l n="5">To practise on us , though for this thing we</l>
     <l n="6">Should pay — if possible — their bribes and fee .</l>
     <l n="7">Search — as thou canst — the old and modern store</l>
     <l n="8">Of Rome and ours , in all the witty score</l>
     <l n="9">Thou shalt not find a rich one ; take each clime ,</l>
     <l n="10">And run o'er all the pilgrimage of time ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thou'lt meet them poor , and ev'rywhere descry</l>
     <l n="12">A threadbare , goldless genealogy .</l>
     <l n="13">Nature — it seems — when she meant us for earth</l>
     <l n="14">Spent so much of her treasure in the birth</l>
     <l n="15">As ever after niggards her , and she ,</l>
     <l n="16">Thus stor 'd within , beggars us outwardly .</l>
     <l n="17">Woful profusion ! at how dear a rate</l>
     <l n="18">Are we made up ! all hope of thrift and state</l>
     <l n="19">Lost for a verse . When I by thoughts look back</l>
     <l n="20">Into the womb of time , and see the rack</l>
     <l n="21">Stand useless there , until we are produc 'd</l>
     <l n="22">Unto the torture , and our souls infus 'd</l>
     <l n="23">To learn afflictions , I begin to doubt</l>
     <l n="24">That as some tyrants use from their chain 'd rout</l>
     <l n="25">Of slaves to pick out one whom for their sport</l>
     <l n="26">They keep afflicted by some ling'ring art ;</l>
     <l n="27">So we are merely thrown upon the stage</l>
     <l n="28">The mirth of fools and legend of the age .</l>
     <l n="29">When I see in the ruins of a suit</l>
     <l n="30">Some nobler breast , and his tongue sadly mute</l>
     <l n="31">Feed on the vocal silence of his eye ,</l>
     <l n="32">And knowing cannot reach the remedy ;</l>
     <l n="33">When souls of baser stamp shine in their store ,</l>
     <l n="34">And he of all the throng is only poor ;</l>
     <l n="35">When French apes for foreign fashions pay ,</l>
     <l n="36">And English legs are dress 'd th ’ outlandish way ,</l>
     <l n="37">So fine too , that they their own shadows woo ,</l>
     <l n="38">While he walks in the sad and pilgrim shoe ;</l>
     <l n="39">I 'm mad at Fate , and angry ev'n to sin ,</l>
     <l n="40">To see deserts and learning clad so thin ;</l>
     <l n="41">To think how th ’ earthly usurer can brood</l>
     <l n="42">Upon his bags , and weigh the precious food</l>
     <l n="43">With palsied hands , as if his soul did fear</l>
     <l n="44">The scales could rob him of what he laid there .</l>
     <l n="45">Like devils that on hid treasures sit , or those</l>
     <l n="46">Whose jealous eyes trust not beyond their nose ,</l>
     <l n="47">They guard the dirt and the bright idol hold</l>
     <l n="48">Close , and commit adultery with gold .</l>
     <l n="49">A curse upon their dross ! how have we sued</l>
     <l n="50">For a few scatter 'd chips ? how oft pursu 'd</l>
     <l n="51">Petitions with a blush , in hope to squeeze</l>
     <l n="52">For their souls ’ health , more than our wants , a piece ?</l>
     <l n="53">Their steel-ribb 'd chests and purse — rust eat them both !—</l>
     <l n="54">Have cost us with much paper many an oath ,</l>
     <l n="55">And protestations of such solemn sense ,</l>
     <l n="56">As if our souls were sureties for the pence .</l>
     <l n="57">Should we a full night 's learnèd cares present ,</l>
     <l n="58">They 'll scarce return us one short hour 's content .</l>
     <l n="59">‘ Las ! they 're but quibbles , things we poets feign ,</l>
     <l n="60">The short-liv 'd squibs and crackers of the brain .</l>
     <l n="61">But we 'll be wiser , knowing ‘ tis not they</l>
     <l n="62">That must redeem the hardship of our way .</l>
     <l n="63">Whether a Higher Power , or that star</l>
     <l n="64">Which , nearest heav'n , is from the earth most far ,</l>
     <l n="65">Oppress us thus , or angell 'd from that sphere</l>
     <l n="66">By our strict guardians are kept luckless here ,</l>
     <l n="67">It matters not , we shall one day obtain</l>
     <l n="68">Our native and celestial scope again .</l>

    <head>TO HIS RETIRED FRIEND , AN INVITATION TO BRECKNOCK .</head>
     <l n="1">Since last we met , thou and thy horse — my dear —</l>
     <l n="2">Have not so much as drunk , or litter 'd here ;</l>
     <l n="3">I wonder , though thyself be thus deceas 'd ,</l>
     <l n="4">Thou hast the spite to coffin up thy beast ;</l>
     <l n="5">Or is the palfrey sick , and his rough hide</l>
     <l n="6">With the penance of one spur mortified ?</l>
     <l n="7">Or taught by thee — like Pythagoras 's ox —</l>
     <l n="8">Is then his master grown more orthodox</l>
     <l n="9">Whatever ‘ tis , a sober cause't must be</l>
     <l n="10">That thus long bars us of thy company .</l>
     <l n="11">The town believes thee lost , and didst thou see</l>
     <l n="12">But half her suff'rings , now distress 'd for thee ,</l>
     <l n="13">Thou'ldst swear — like Rome — her foul , polluted walls</l>
     <l n="14">Were sack 'd by Brennus and the savage Gauls .</l>
     <l n="15">Abominable face of things ! here 's noise</l>
     <l n="16">Of banged mortars , blue aprons , and boys ,</l>
     <l n="17">Pigs , dogs , and drums , with the hoarse , hellish notes</l>
     <l n="18">Of politicly-deaf usurers ’ throats ,</l>
     <l n="19">With new fine Worships , and the old cast team</l>
     <l n="20">Of Justices vex 'd with the cough and phlegm .</l>
     <l n="21">‘ Midst these the Cross looks sad , and in the Shire-</l>
     <l n="22">Hall furs of an old Saxon fox appear ,</l>
     <l n="23">With brotherly ruffs and beards , and a strange sight</l>
     <l n="24">Of high monumental hats , ta'en at the fight</l>
     <l n="25">Of ‘ Eighty-eight ; while ev'ry burgess foots</l>
     <l n="26">The mortal pavement in eternal boots .</l>
     <l n="27">Hadst thou been bach'lor , I had soon divin 'd</l>
     <l n="28">Thy close retirements , and monastic mind ;</l>
     <l n="29">Perhaps some nymph had been to visit , or</l>
     <l n="30">The beauteous churl was to be waited for ,</l>
     <l n="31">And like the Greek , ere you the sport would miss ,</l>
     <l n="32">You stay 'd , and strok 'd the distaff for a kiss .</l>
     <l n="33">But in this age , when thy cool , settled blood</l>
     <l n="34">Is ti 'd t'one flesh , and thou almost grown good ,</l>
     <l n="35">I know not how to reach the strange device ,</l>
     <l n="36">Except — Domitian-like — thou murder'st flies .</l>
     <l n="37">Or is't thy piety ? for who can tell</l>
     <l n="38">But thou may'st prove devout , and love a cell ,</l>
     <l n="39">And — like a badger — with attentive looks</l>
     <l n="40">In the dark hole sit rooting up of books .</l>
     <l n="41">Quick hermit ! what a peaceful change hadst thou ,</l>
     <l n="42">Without the noise of haircloth , whip , or vow !</l>
     <l n="43">But there is no redemption ? must there be</l>
     <l n="44">No other penance but of liberty ?</l>
     <l n="45">Why , two months hence , if thou continue thus ,</l>
     <l n="46">Thy memory will scarce remain with us ,</l>
     <l n="47">The drawers have forgot thee , and exclaim</l>
     <l n="48">They have not seen thee here since Charles , his reign ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or if they mention thee , like some old man ,</l>
     <l n="50">That at each word inserts — “ Sir , as I can</l>
     <l n="51">Remember ” — so the cyph'rers puzzle me</l>
     <l n="52">With a dark , cloudy character of thee .</l>
     <l n="53">That — certs !— I fear thou wilt be lost , and we</l>
     <l n="54">Must ask the fathers ere't be long for thee .</l>
     <l n="55">Come ! leave this sullen state , and let not wine</l>
     <l n="56">And precious wit lie dead for want of thine .</l>
     <l n="57">Shall the dull market-landlord with his rout</l>
     <l n="58">Of sneaking tenants dirtily swill out</l>
     <l n="59">This harmless liquor ? shall they knock and beat</l>
     <l n="60">For sack , only to talk of rye and wheat ?</l>
     <l n="61">O let not such prepost'rous tippling be</l>
     <l n="62">In our metropolis ; may I ne'er see</l>
     <l n="63">Such tavern-sacrilege , nor lend a line</l>
     <l n="64">To weep the rapes and tragedy of wine !</l>
     <l n="65">Here lives that chymic , quick fire which betrays</l>
     <l n="66">Fresh spirits to the blood , and warms our lays .</l>
     <l n="67">I have reserv 'd ‘ gainst thy approach a cup</l>
     <l n="68">That were thy Muse stark dead , shall raise her up ,</l>
     <l n="69">And teach her yet more charming words and skill</l>
     <l n="70">Than ever C [ oe ] lia , Chloris , Astrophil ,</l>
     <l n="71">Or any of the threadbare names inspir 'd</l>
     <l n="72">Poor rhyming lovers with a mistress fir 'd .</l>
     <l n="73">Come then ! and while the slow icicle hangs</l>
     <l n="74">At the stiff thatch , and Winter 's frosty pangs</l>
     <l n="75">Benumb the year , blithe — as of old — let us</l>
     <l n="76">‘ Midst noise and war of peace and mirth discuss .</l>
     <l n="77">This portion thou wert born for : why should we</l>
     <l n="78">Vex at the time 's ridiculous misery ?</l>
     <l n="79">An age that thus hath fool 'd itself , and will</l>
     <l n="80">— Spite of thy teeth and mine — persist so still .</l>
     <l n="81">Let 's sit then at this fire , and while we steal</l>
     <l n="82">A revel in the town , let others seal ,</l>
     <l n="83">Purchase or cheat , and who can , let them pay ,</l>
     <l n="84">Till those black deeds bring on the darksome day .</l>
     <l n="85">Innocent spenders we ! a better use</l>
     <l n="86">Shall wear out our short lease , and leave th ’ obtuse</l>
     <l n="87">Rout to their husks ; they and their bags at best</l>
     <l n="88">Have cares in earnest ; we care for a jest .</l>

     <l n="3">Her stoln descents to Earth , and what did move her</l>

     <l n="8">Nocturnal pilgrimage , with thy dreams clad</l>
     <l n="9">In fancies darker than thy cave , thy glass</l>

     <l n="11">In her calm voyage what discourse she heard</l>
     <l n="12">Of spirits , what dark groves and ill-shap 'd guard</l>

     <l n="22">A tree , or fountain , and in that reprieve</l>
     <l n="23">What ages they consume , with the sad vale</l>

     <l n="4">I am confirmed , and so much wing is given</l>
     <l n="5">To my wild thoughts , that they dare strike at heav'n .</l>
     <l n="6">A full year 's grief I struggled with , and stood</l>
     <l n="7">Still on my sandy hopes ’ uncertain good ,</l>
     <l n="8">So loth was I to yield ; to all those fears</l>
     <l n="9">I still oppos 'd thee , and denied my tears .</l>
     <l n="10">But thou art gone ! and the untimely loss</l>
     <l n="11">Like that one day hath made all others cross .</l>
     <l n="12">Have you seen on some river 's flow'ry brow</l>
     <l n="13">A well-built elm or stately cedar grow ,</l>
     <l n="14">Whose curled tops gilt with the morning-ray</l>
     <l n="15">Beckon 'd the sun , and whisper 'd to the day ,</l>
     <l n="16">When unexpected from the angry North</l>
     <l n="17">A fatal sullen whirlwind sallies forth ,</l>
     <l n="18">And with a full-mouth 'd blast rends from the ground</l>
     <l n="19">The shady twins , which rushing scatter round</l>
     <l n="20">Their sighing leaves , whilst overborn with strength</l>
     <l n="21">Their trembling heads bow to a prostrate length ?</l>
     <l n="22">So forc 'd fell he ; so immaturely Death</l>
     <l n="23">Stifled his able heart and active breath .</l>
     <l n="24">The world scarce knew him yet , his early soul</l>
     <l n="25">Had but new-broke her day , and rather stole</l>
     <l n="26">A sight than gave one ; as if subtly she</l>
     <l n="27">Would learn our stock , but hide his treasury .</l>
     <l n="28">His years — should Time lay both his wings and glass</l>
     <l n="29">Unto his charge — could not be summ 'd — alas !—</l>
     <l n="30">To a full score ; though in so short a span</l>
     <l n="31">His riper thoughts had purchas 'd more of man</l>
     <l n="32">Than all those worthless livers , which yet quick</l>
     <l n="33">Have quite outgone their own arithmetic .</l>
     <l n="34">He seiz 'd perfections , and without a dull</l>
     <l n="35">And mossy grey possess 'd a solid skull ;</l>
     <l n="36">No crooked knowledge neither , nor did he</l>
     <l n="37">Wear the friend 's name for ends and policy ,</l>
     <l n="38">And then lay't by ; as those lost youths of th ’ stage</l>
     <l n="39">Who only flourish 'd for the Play 's short age</l>
     <l n="40">And then retir 'd ; like jewels , in each part</l>
     <l n="41">He wore his friends , but chiefly at his heart .</l>
     <l n="42">Nor was it only in this he did excel ,</l>
     <l n="43">His equal valour could as much , as well .</l>
     <l n="44">He knew no fear but of his God ; yet durst</l>
     <l n="45">No injury , nor — as some have — e'er purs 'd</l>
     <l n="46">The sweat and tears of others , yet would be</l>
     <l n="47">More forward in a royal gallantry</l>
     <l n="48">Than all those vast pretenders , which of late</l>
     <l n="49">Swell 'd in the ruins of their king and State .</l>
     <l n="50">He weav 'd not self-ends and the public good</l>
     <l n="51">Into one piece , nor with the people 's blood</l>
     <l n="52">Fill 'd his own veins ; in all the doubtful way</l>
     <l n="53">Conscience and honour rul 'd him . O that day</l>
     <l n="54">When like the fathers in the fire and cloud</l>
     <l n="55">I miss 'd thy face ! I might in ev'ry crowd</l>
     <l n="56">See arms like thine , and men advance , but none</l>
     <l n="57">So near to lightning mov 'd , nor so fell on .</l>
     <l n="58">Have you observ 'd how soon the nimble eye</l>
     <l n="59">Brings th ’ object to conceit , and doth so vie</l>
     <l n="60">Performance with the soul , that you would swear</l>
     <l n="61">The act and apprehension both lodg 'd there ;</l>
     <l n="62">Just so mov 'd he : like shot his active hand</l>
     <l n="63">Drew blood , ere well the foe could understand .</l>
     <l n="64">But here I lost him . Whether the last turn</l>
     <l n="65">Of thy few sands call 'd on thy hasty urn ,</l>
     <l n="66">Or some fierce rapid fate — hid from the eye —</l>

     <l n="82">Though but a private turf , it can do more</l>

     <l n="88">Of posthume honours ; there is not one sand</l>
     <l n="89">Sleeps o'er thy grave , but can outbid that hand</l>
     <l n="90">And pencil too , so that of force we must</l>
     <l n="91">Confess their heaps show lesser than thy dust .</l>
     <l n="92">And — blessed soul !— though this my sorrow can</l>
     <l n="93">Add nought to thy perfections , yet as man</l>
     <l n="94">Subject to envy , and the common fate ,</l>
     <l n="95">It may redeem thee to a fairer date .</l>

     <l n="98">So these perhaps , though much beneath thy fame ,</l>
     <l n="99">May keep some weak remembrance of thy name ,</l>
     <l n="100">And to the faith of better times commend</l>

    <head>UPON A CLOAK LENT HIM BY MR. J. RIDSLEY .</head>
     <l n="1">Here , take again thy sackcloth ! and thank heav'n</l>
     <l n="2">Thy courtship hath not kill 'd me ; Is't not even</l>
     <l n="3">Whether we die by piecemeal , or at once ?</l>
     <l n="4">Since both but ruin , why then for the nonce</l>
     <l n="5">Didst husband my afflictions , and cast o'er</l>
     <l n="6">Me this forc 'd hurdle to inflame the score ?</l>
     <l n="7">Had I near London in this rug been seen</l>
     <l n="8">Without doubt I had executed been</l>
     <l n="9">For some bold Irish spy , and ‘ cross a sledge</l>
     <l n="10">Had lain mess 'd up for their four gates and bridge .</l>
     <l n="11">When first I bore it , my oppressèd feet</l>
     <l n="12">Would needs persuade me ‘ twas some leaden sheet ;</l>
     <l n="13">Such deep impressions , and such dangerous holes</l>
     <l n="14">Were made , that I began to doubt my soles ,</l>
     <l n="15">And ev'ry step — so near necessity —</l>
     <l n="16">Devoutly wish 'd some honest cobbler by ;</l>
     <l n="17">Besides it was so short , the Jewish rag</l>
     <l n="18">Seem 'd circumcis 'd , but had a Gentile shag .</l>
     <l n="19">Hadst thou been with me on that day , when we</l>
     <l n="20">Left craggy Biston , and the fatal Dee ,</l>
     <l n="21">When beaten with fresh storms and late mishap</l>
     <l n="22">It shar 'd the office of a cloak , and cap ,</l>
     <l n="23">To see how ‘ bout my clouded head it stood</l>
     <l n="24">Like a thick turban , or some lawyer 's hood ,</l>
     <l n="25">While the stiff , hollow pleats on ev'ry side</l>
     <l n="26">Like conduit-pipes rain 'd from the bearded hide :</l>
     <l n="27">I know thou wouldst in spite of that day 's fate</l>
     <l n="28">Let loose thy mirth at my new shape and state ,</l>
     <l n="29">And with a shallow smile or two profess</l>
     <l n="30">Some Saracen had lost the clouted dress .</l>
     <l n="31">Didst ever see the good wife — as they say —</l>
     <l n="32">March in her short cloak on the christ'ning day ,</l>
     <l n="33">With what soft motions she salutes the church ,</l>
     <l n="34">And leaves the bedrid mother in the lurch ;</l>
     <l n="35">Just so jogg 'd I , while my dull horse did trudge</l>
     <l n="36">Like a circuit-beast , plagu 'd with a gouty judge .</l>
     <l n="37">But this was civil . I have since known more</l>
     <l n="38">And worser pranks : one night — as heretofore</l>
     <l n="39">Th ’ hast known — for want of change — a thing which I</l>
     <l n="40">And Bias us 'd before me — I did lie</l>
     <l n="41">Pure Adamite , and simply for that end</l>
     <l n="42">Resolv 'd , and made this for my bosom-friend .</l>
     <l n="43">O that thou hadst been there next morn , that I</l>
     <l n="44">Might teach thee new Micro-cosmo-graphy !</l>
     <l n="45">Thou wouldst have ta'en me , as I naked stood ,</l>
     <l n="46">For one of the seven pillars before the flood .</l>
     <l n="47">Such characters and hieroglyphics were</l>
     <l n="48">In one night worn , that thou mightst justly swear</l>
     <l n="49">I 'd slept in cere-cloth , or at Bedlam , where</l>
     <l n="50">The madmen lodge in straw . I 'll not forbear</l>
     <l n="51">To tell thee all ; his wild impress and tricks</l>
     <l n="52">Like Speed 's old Britons made me look , or Picts ;</l>
     <l n="53">His villanous , biting , wire-embraces</l>
     <l n="54">Had seal 'd in me more strange forms and faces</l>
     <l n="55">Than children see in dreams , or thou hast read</l>
     <l n="56">In arras , puppet-plays , and gingerbread ,</l>
     <l n="57">With angled schemes , and crosses that bred fear</l>
     <l n="58">Of being handled by some conjurer ;</l>
     <l n="59">And nearer , thou wouldst think — such strokes were drawn —</l>
     <l n="60">I 'd been some rough statue of Fetter-lane .</l>
     <l n="61">Nay , I believe , had I that instant been</l>
     <l n="62">By surgeons or apothecaries seen ,</l>
     <l n="63">They had condemned my raz 'd skin to be</l>
     <l n="64">Some walking herbal , or anatomy .</l>
     <l n="65">But — thanks to th ’ day !— ‘ tis off . I 'd now advise</l>
     <l n="66">Thee , friend , to put this piece to merchandise .</l>
     <l n="67">The pedlars of our age have business yet ,</l>
     <l n="68">And gladly would against the Fair-day fit</l>
     <l n="69">Themselves with such a roof , that can secure</l>
     <l n="70">Their wares from dogs and cats rained in shower .</l>
     <l n="71">It shall perform ; or if this will not do</l>
     <l n="72">‘ Twill take the ale-wives sure ; ‘ twill make them two</l>
     <l n="73">Fine rooms of one , and spread upon a stick</l>
     <l n="74">Is a partition , without lime or brick .</l>
     <l n="75">Horn 'd obstinacy ! how my heart doth fret</l>
     <l n="76">To think what mouths and elbows it would set</l>
     <l n="77">In a wet day ! have you for twopence ere</l>
     <l n="78">Seen King Harry 's chapel at Westminster ,</l>
     <l n="79">Where in their dusty gowns of brass and stone</l>
     <l n="80">The judges lie , and mark 'd you how each one ,</l>
     <l n="81">In sturdy marble-pleats about the knee ,</l>
     <l n="82">Bears up to show his legs and symmetry ?</l>
     <l n="83">Just so would this , that I think't weav 'd upon</l>
     <l n="84">Some stiffneck 'd Brownist 's exercising loom .</l>
     <l n="85">O that thou hadst it when this juggling fate</l>
     <l n="86">Of soldiery first seiz 'd me ! at what rate</l>
     <l n="87">Would I have bought it then ; what was there but</l>
     <l n="88">I would have giv'n for the compendious hut ?</l>
     <l n="89">I do not doubt but — if the weight could please —</l>
     <l n="90">‘ Twould guard me better than a Lapland-lease .</l>
     <l n="91">Or a German shirt with enchanted lint</l>
     <l n="92">Stuff 'd through , and th ’ devil 's beard and face weav 'd i n't .</l>
     <l n="93">But I have done . And think not , friend , that I</l>
     <l n="94">This freedom took to jeer thy courtesy .</l>
     <l n="95">I thank thee for't , and I believe my Muse</l>
     <l n="96">So known to thee , thou'lt not suspect abuse .</l>
     <l n="97">She did this , ‘ cause — perhaps — thy love paid thus</l>
     <l n="98">Might with my thanks outlive thy cloak , and us .</l>

     <l n="1">I knew thee not , nor durst attendance strive ,</l>
     <l n="2">Label to wit , verser remonstrative ,</l>
     <l n="3">And in some suburb-page — scandal to thine —</l>
     <l n="4">Like Lent before a Christmas scatter mine .</l>
     <l n="5">This speaks thee not , since at the utmost rate</l>
     <l n="6">Such remnants from thy piece entreat their date ;</l>
     <l n="7">Nor can I dub the copy , or afford</l>
     <l n="8">Titles to swell the rear of verse with lord ;</l>
     <l n="9">Nor politicly big , to inch low fame ,</l>
     <l n="10">Stretch in the glories of a stranger 's name ,</l>
     <l n="11">And clip those bays I court ; weak striver I ,</l>
     <l n="12">But a faint echo unto poetry .</l>
     <l n="13">I have not clothes t'adopt me , nor must sit</l>
     <l n="14">For plush and velvet 's sake , esquire of wit .</l>
     <l n="15">Yet modesty these crosses would improve ,</l>
     <l n="16">And rags near thee , some reverence may move .</l>
     <l n="17">I did believe — great Beaumont being dead —</l>
     <l n="18">Thy widow 'd Muse slept on his flow'ry bed ;</l>
     <l n="19">But I am richly cozen 'd , and can see</l>
     <l n="20">Wit transmigrates : his spirit stay 'd with thee ;</l>
     <l n="21">Which , doubly advantag 'd by thy single pen ,</l>
     <l n="22">In life and death now treads the stage again .</l>
     <l n="23">And thus are we freed from that dearth of wit</l>
     <l n="24">Which starv 'd the land , since into schisms split ,</l>
     <l n="25">Wherein th ’ hast done so much , we must needs guess</l>
     <l n="26">Wit 's last edition is now i ’ th ’ press .</l>
     <l n="27">For thou hast drain 'd invention , and he</l>
     <l n="28">That writes hereafter , doth but pillage thee .</l>
     <l n="29">But thou hast plots ; and will not the Kirk strain</l>
     <l n="30">At the designs of such a tragic brain ?</l>
     <l n="31">Will they themselves think safe , when they shall see</l>
     <l n="32">Thy most abominable policy ?</l>
     <l n="33">Will not the Ears assemble , and think't fit</l>
     <l n="34">Their Synod fast and pray against thy wit ?</l>
     <l n="35">But they 'll not tire in such an idle quest ;</l>
     <l n="36">Thou dost but kill , and circumvent in jest ;</l>
     <l n="37">And when thy anger 'd Muse swells to a blow</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Tis but for Field 's , or Swansted 's overthrow .</l>
     <l n="39">Yet shall these conquests of thy bays outlive</l>
     <l n="40">Their Scottish zeal , and compacts made to grieve</l>
     <l n="41">The peace of spirits : and when such deeds fail</l>
     <l n="42">Of their foul ends , a fair name is thy bail .</l>
     <l n="43">But — happy thou !— ne'er saw'st these storms , our air</l>
     <l n="44">Teem 'd with even in thy time , though seeming fair .</l>
     <l n="45">Thy gentle soul , meant for the shade and ease ,</l>
     <l n="46">Withdrew betimes into the Land of Peace .</l>
     <l n="47">So nested in some hospitable shore</l>
     <l n="48">The hermit-angler , when the mid-seas roar ,</l>
     <l n="49">Packs up his lines , and — ere the tempest raves —</l>
     <l n="50">Retires , and leaves his station to the waves .</l>
     <l n="51">Thus thou died'st almost with our peace , and we</l>
     <l n="52">This breathing time thy last fair issue see ,</l>
     <l n="53">Which I think such — if needless ink not soil</l>
     <l n="54">So choice a Muse — others are but thy foil .</l>
     <l n="55">This , or that age may write , but never see</l>
     <l n="56">A wit that dares run parallel with thee .</l>
     <l n="57">True , Ben must live ! but bate him , and thou hast</l>
     <l n="58">Undone all future wits , and match 'd the past .</l>

     <l n="1">I did but see thee ! and how vain it is</l>
     <l n="2">To vex thee for it with remonstrances ,</l>
     <l n="3">Though things in fashion ; let those judge , who sit</l>
     <l n="4">Their twelve pence out , to clap their hands at wit</l>
     <l n="5">I fear to sin thus near thee ; for — great saint !—</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Tis known true beauty hath no need of paint .</l>
     <l n="7">Yet , since a label fix 'd to thy fair hearse</l>
     <l n="8">Is all the mode , and tears put into verse</l>
     <l n="9">Can teach posterity our present grief</l>
     <l n="10">And their own loss , but never give relief ;</l>
     <l n="11">I 'll tell them — and a truth which needs no pass —</l>
     <l n="12">That wit in Cartwright at her zenith was .</l>
     <l n="13">Arts , fancy , language , all conven 'd in thee ,</l>
     <l n="14">With those grand miracles which deify</l>
     <l n="15">The old world 's writings , kept yet from the fire</l>
     <l n="16">Because they force these worst times to admire .</l>
     <l n="17">Thy matchless genius , in all thou didst write ,</l>
     <l n="18">Like the sun , wrought with such staid heat and light ,</l>
     <l n="19">That not a line — to the most critic he —</l>
     <l n="20">Offends with flashes , or obscurity .</l>
     <l n="21">When thou the wild of humours track'st , thy pen</l>
     <l n="22">So imitates that motley stock in men ,</l>
     <l n="23">As if thou hadst in all their bosoms been ,</l>
     <l n="24">And seen those leopards that lurk within .</l>
     <l n="25">The am'rous youth steals from thy courtly page</l>
     <l n="26">His vow 'd address , the soldier his brave rage ;</l>
     <l n="27">And those soft beauteous readers whose looks can</l>
     <l n="28">Make some men poets , and make any man</l>
     <l n="29">A lover , when thy slave but seems to die ,</l>
     <l n="30">Turn all his mourners , and melt at the eye .</l>
     <l n="31">Thus thou thy thoughts hast dress 'd in such a strain</l>
     <l n="32">As doth not only speak , but rule and reign ;</l>
     <l n="33">Nor are those bodies they assum 'd dark clouds ,</l>
     <l n="34">Or a thick bark , but clear , transparent shrouds ,</l>
     <l n="35">Which who looks on , the rays so strongly beat</l>
     <l n="36">They 'll brush and warm him with a quick'ning heat ;</l>
     <l n="37">So souls shine at the eyes , and pearls display</l>
     <l n="38">Through the loose crystal-streams a glance of day .</l>
     <l n="39">But what 's all this unto a royal test ?</l>
     <l n="40">Thou art the man whom great Charles so express 'd !</l>
     <l n="41">Then let the crowd refrain their needless hum ,</l>

     <l n="3">Yet flow these not from any base distrust</l>

     <l n="20">More by thy single worth than our whole bands .</l>
     <l n="21">Yet could the puling tribute rescue ought</l>
     <l n="22">In this sad loss , or wert thou to be brought</l>
     <l n="23">Back here by tears , I would in any wise</l>
     <l n="24">Pay down the sum , or quite consume my eyes .</l>
     <l n="25">Thou fell'st our double ruin ; and this rent</l>
     <l n="26">Forc 'd in thy life shak 'd both the Church and tent .</l>
     <l n="27">Learning in others steals them from the van ,</l>
     <l n="28">And basely wise emasculates the man ,</l>
     <l n="29">But lodg 'd in thy brave soul the bookish feat</l>
     <l n="30">Serv 'd only as the light unto thy heat .</l>
     <l n="31">Thus when some quitted action , to their shame ,</l>
     <l n="32">And only got a discreet coward 's name ,</l>
     <l n="33">Thou with thy blood mad'st purchase of renown ,</l>
     <l n="34">And died'st the glory of the sword and gown .</l>
     <l n="35">Thy blood hath hallow 'd Pomfret , and this blow</l>
     <l n="36">— Profan 'd before — hath church 'd the Castle now .</l>
     <l n="37">Nor is't a common valour we deplore ,</l>
     <l n="38">But such as with fifteen a hundred bore ,</l>
     <l n="39">And lightning-like — not coop 'd within a wall —</l>
     <l n="40">In storms of fire and steel fell on them all .</l>
     <l n="41">Thou wert no woolsack soldier , nor of those</l>
     <l n="42">Whose courage lies in winking at their foes ,</l>
     <l n="43">That live at loopholes , and consume their breath</l>
     <l n="44">On match or pipes , and sometimes peep at death ;</l>
     <l n="45">No , it were sin to number these with thee ,</l>
     <l n="46">But that — thus pois 'd — our loss we better see .</l>
     <l n="47">The fair and open valour was thy shield ,</l>
     <l n="48">And thy known station , the defying field .</l>
     <l n="49">Yet these in thee I would not virtues call ,</l>
     <l n="50">But that this age must know that thou hadst all .</l>
     <l n="51">Those richer graces that adorn 'd thy mind</l>
     <l n="52">Like stars of the first magnitude , so shin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="53">That if oppos 'd unto these lesser lights</l>
     <l n="54">All we can say is this , they were fair nights .</l>
     <l n="55">Thy piety and learning did unite ,</l>
     <l n="56">And though with sev'ral beams made up one light ,</l>
     <l n="57">And such thy judgment was , that I dare swear</l>
     <l n="58">Whole councils might as soon and synods err .</l>
     <l n="59">But all these now are out ! and as some star</l>
     <l n="60">Hurl 'd in diurnal motions from far ,</l>
     <l n="61">And seen to droop at night , is vainly said</l>
     <l n="62">To fall and find an occidental bed ,</l>
     <l n="63">Though in that other world what we judge West</l>
     <l n="64">Proves elevation , and a new , fresh East ;</l>
     <l n="65">So though our weaker sense denies us sight ,</l>
     <l n="66">And bodies cannot trace the spirit 's flight ,</l>
     <l n="67">We know those graces to be still in thee ,</l>
     <l n="68">But wing 'd above us to eternity .</l>
     <l n="69">Since then — thus flown — thou art so much refin 'd</l>
     <l n="70">That we can only reach thee with the mind ,</l>
     <l n="71">I will not in this dark and narrow glass</l>
     <l n="72">Let thy scant shadow for perfections pass ,</l>
     <l n="73">But leave thee to be read more high , more quaint ,</l>
     <l n="74">In thy own blood a soldier and a saint .</l>

     <l n="82">This foreign statesman to our breast or brain ;</l>
     <l n="83">You have enlarg 'd his praise , and from your store</l>
     <l n="84">By this edition made his worth the more .</l>

     <l n="93">And like those stars which near the poles do steer</l>
     <l n="94">Were't but in one part of the globe seen clear .</l>
     <l n="95">Provence and Naples were the best and most</l>
     <l n="96">Thou couldst shine in ; fix 'd to that single coast ,</l>
     <l n="97">Perhaps some cardinal , to be thought wise ,</l>
     <l n="98">And honest too , would ask , what was thy price ?</l>
     <l n="99">Then thou must pack to Rome , where thou mightst lie</l>
     <l n="100">Ere thou shouldst have new clothes eternally ,</l>
     <l n="101">For though so near the sev'n hills , ne'ertheless</l>
     <l n="102">Thou cam'st to Antwerp for thy Roman dress .</l>
     <l n="103">But now thou art come hither , thou mayst run</l>
     <l n="104">Through any clime as well known as the sun ,</l>
     <l n="105">And in thy sev'ral dresses , like the year ,</l>
     <l n="106">Challenge acquaintance with each peopled sphere .</l>
     <l n="107">Come then , rare politicians of the time ,</l>
     <l n="108">Brains of some standing , elders in our clime ,</l>
     <l n="109">See here the method . A wise , solid State</l>
     <l n="110">Is quick in acting , friendly in debate ,</l>
     <l n="111">Joint in advice , in resolutions just ,</l>
     <l n="112">Mild in success , true to the common trust .</l>
     <l n="113">It cements ruptures , and by gentle hand</l>
     <l n="114">Allays the heat and burnings of a land ;</l>
     <l n="115">Religion guides it , and in all the tract</l>
     <l n="116">Designs so twist , that Heav'n confirms the act .</l>
     <l n="117">If from these lists you wander as you steer ,</l>
     <l n="118">Look back , and catechize your actions here .</l>
     <l n="119">These are the marks to which true statesmen tend ,</l>

    <head>TO THE MOST EXCELLENTLY ACCOMPLISHED MRS. K. PHILIPS .</head>
     <l n="1">Say , witty fair one , from what sphere</l>
     <l n="2">Flow these rich numbers you shed here ?</l>
     <l n="3">For sure such incantations come</l>
     <l n="4">From thence , which strike your readers dumb .</l>
     <l n="5">A strain , whose measures gently meet</l>
     <l n="6">Like virgin-lovers or Time 's feet ;</l>
     <l n="7">Where language smiles , and accents rise</l>
     <l n="8">As quick and pleasing as your eyes ;</l>
     <l n="9">The poem smooth , and in each line</l>
     <l n="10">Soft as yourself , yet masculine ;</l>
     <l n="11">Where not coarse trifles blot the page</l>
     <l n="12">With matter borrow 'd from the age ,</l>
     <l n="13">But thoughts as innocent and high</l>
     <l n="14">As angels have , or saints that die .</l>
     <l n="15">These raptures when I first did see</l>
     <l n="16">New miracles in poetry ,</l>
     <l n="17">And by a hand their good would miss</l>
     <l n="18">His bays and fountains but to kiss ,</l>
     <l n="19">My weaker genius — cross to fashion —</l>
     <l n="20">Slept in a silent admiration :</l>
     <l n="21">A rescue , by whose grave disguise</l>
     <l n="22">Pretenders oft have pass 'd for wise .</l>
     <l n="23">And yet as pilgrims humbly touch</l>
     <l n="24">Those shrines to which they bow so much ,</l>
     <l n="25">And clouds in courtship flock , and run</l>
     <l n="26">To be the mask unto the sun ,</l>
     <l n="27">So I concluded it was true</l>
     <l n="28">I might at distance worship you ,</l>
     <l n="29">A Persian votary , and say</l>
     <l n="30">It was your light show 'd me the way .</l>
     <l n="31">So loadstones guide the duller steel ,</l>
     <l n="32">And high perfections are the wheel</l>
     <l n="33">Which moves the less , for gifts divine</l>
     <l n="34">Are strung upon a vital line ,</l>
     <l n="35">Which , touch 'd by you , excites in all</l>
     <l n="36">Affections epidemical .</l>
     <l n="37">And this made me — a truth most fit —</l>
     <l n="38">Add my weak echo to your wit ;</l>
     <l n="39">Which pardon , Lady , for assays</l>
     <l n="40">Obscure as these might blast your bays ;</l>
     <l n="41">As common hands soil flow'rs , and make</l>
     <l n="42">That dew they wear weep the mistake .</l>
     <l n="43">But I 'll wash off the stain , and vow</l>

     <l n="31">So thy sad stars dispens 'd to thee</l>
     <l n="32">No influx but calamity ;</l>

     <l n="6">As chaste as stars converse and smile above .</l>
     <l n="7">Th ’ hast taught their language and their love to flow</l>
     <l n="8">Calm as rose-leaves , and cool as virgin-snow ,</l>
     <l n="9">Which doubly feasts us , being so refin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="10">They both delight and dignify the mind ;</l>

     <l n="26">At crumbs and voiders , and because unbid ,</l>
     <l n="27">Refrain wise appetite . This made thy fire</l>
     <l n="28">Break through the ashes of thy aged sire ,</l>
     <l n="29">To lend the world such a convincing light</l>
     <l n="30">As shows his fancy darker than his sight .</l>
     <l n="31">Nor was't alone the bars and length of days</l>
     <l n="32">— Though those gave strength and stature to his bays —</l>
     <l n="33">Encounter 'd thee , but what 's an old complaint</l>
     <l n="34">And kills the fancy , a forlorn restraint .</l>
     <l n="35">How couldst thou , mur 'd in solitary stones ,</l>
     <l n="36">Dress Birtha 's smiles , though well thou mightst her groans ?</l>
     <l n="37">And , strangely eloquent , thyself divide</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Twixt sad misfortunes and a bloomy bride ?</l>
     <l n="39">Through all the tenour of thy ample song ,</l>
     <l n="40">Spun from thy own rich store , and shar 'd among</l>
     <l n="41">Those fair adventurers , we plainly see</l>
     <l n="42">Th ’ imputed gifts inherent are in thee .</l>
     <l n="43">Then live for ever — and by high desert —</l>

     <l n="17">Or are you gods — like us — in such a state</l>
     <l n="18">As cannot alter the decrees of fate ?</l>

     <l n="23">With Persia , Ganges , and whatever streams</l>
     <l n="24">The thirsty Moor drinks in the mid-day beams .</l>
     <l n="25">But thou wert twice-born , and the Fates to thee</l>
     <l n="26">— To make all sure — doubled thy misery .</l>
     <l n="27">My sufferings too are many — if it be</l>
     <l n="28">Held safe for me to boast adversity —</l>
     <l n="29">Nor was't a common blow , but from above ,</l>
     <l n="30">Like his that died for imitating Jove ;</l>
     <l n="31">Which , when thou heardst , a ruin so divine</l>
     <l n="32">And mother-like should make thee pity mine ,</l>
     <l n="33">And on this day , which poets unto thee</l>
     <l n="34">Crown with full bowls , ask what 's become of me ?</l>
     <l n="35">Help , buxom god , then ! so may thy lov 'd vine</l>
     <l n="36">Swarm with the num'rous grape , and big with wine</l>
     <l n="37">Load the kind elm , and so thy orgies be</l>
     <l n="38">With priests ’ loud shouts and satyrs ’ kept to thee !</l>
     <l n="39">So may in death Lycurgus ne'er be blest ,</l>
     <l n="40">Nor Pentheus ’ wand'ring ghost find any rest !</l>
     <l n="41">And so for ever bright — thy chief desires —</l>
     <l n="42">May thy wife 's crown outshine the lesser fires !</l>
     <l n="43">If but now , mindful of my love to thee ,</l>
     <l n="44">Thou wilt , in what thou canst , my helper be .</l>

    <head>TO HIS WIFE AT ROME , WHEN HE WAS SICK .</head>
     <l n="1">Dearest ! if you those fair eyes — wond'ring — stick</l>
     <l n="2">On this strange character , know I am sick ;</l>
     <l n="3">Sick in the skirts of the lost world , where I</l>
     <l n="4">Breathe hopeless of all comforts , but to die .</l>
     <l n="5">What heart — think'st thou ?— have I in this sad seat ,</l>
     <l n="6">Tormented ‘ twixt the Sauromate and Gete ?</l>
     <l n="7">Nor air nor water please : their very sky</l>
     <l n="8">Looks strange and unaccustom 'd to my eye ;</l>
     <l n="9">I scarce dare breathe it , and , I know not how ,</l>
     <l n="10">The earth that bears me shows unpleasant now .</l>
     <l n="11">Nor diet here 's , nor lodging for my ease ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor any one that studies a disease ;</l>
     <l n="13">No friend to comfort me , none to defray</l>
     <l n="14">With smooth discourse the charges of the day .</l>
     <l n="15">All tir 'd alone I lie , and — thus — whate'er</l>
     <l n="16">Is absent , and at Rome , I fancy here .</l>
     <l n="17">But when thou com'st , I blot the airy scroll ,</l>
     <l n="18">And give thee full possession of my soul .</l>
     <l n="19">Thee — absent — I embrace , thee only voice .</l>
     <l n="20">And night and day belie a husband 's joys .</l>
     <l n="21">Nay , of thy name so oft I mention make</l>
     <l n="22">That I am thought distracted for thy sake .</l>
     <l n="23">When my tir 'd spirits fail , and my sick heart</l>
     <l n="24">Draws in that fire which actuates each part ,</l>
     <l n="25">If any say , th'art come ! I force my pain ,</l>
     <l n="26">And hope to see thee gives me life again .</l>
     <l n="27">Thus I for thee , whilst thou — perhaps — more blest ,</l>
     <l n="28">Careless of me dost breathe all peace and rest ,</l>
     <l n="29">Which yet I think not , for — dear soul !— too well</l>
     <l n="30">Know I thy grief , since my first woes befell .</l>
     <l n="31">But if strict Heav'n my stock of days hath spun ,</l>
     <l n="32">And with my life my error will be gone ,</l>
     <l n="33">How easy then — O Cæsar !— were't for thee</l>
     <l n="34">To pardon one , that now doth cease to be ?</l>
     <l n="35">That I might yield my native air this breath ,</l>
     <l n="36">And banish not my ashes after death .</l>
     <l n="37">Would thou hadst either spar 'd me until dead ,</l>
     <l n="38">Or with my blood redeem 'd my absent head !</l>
     <l n="39">Thou shouldst have had both freely , but O ! thou</l>
     <l n="40">Wouldst have me live to die an exile now .</l>
     <l n="41">And must I then from Rome so far meet death ,</l>
     <l n="42">And double by the place my loss of breath ?</l>
     <l n="43">Nor in my last of hours on my own bed</l>
     <l n="44">— In the sad conflict — rest my dying head ?</l>
     <l n="45">Nor my soul 's whispers — the last pledge of life ,—</l>
     <l n="46">Mix with the tears and kisses of a wife ?</l>
     <l n="47">My last words none must treasure , none will rise</l>
     <l n="48">And — with a tear — seal up my vanquish 'd eyes ;</l>
     <l n="49">Without these rites I die , distress 'd in all</l>
     <l n="50">The splendid sorrows of a funeral ;</l>
     <l n="51">Unpitied , and unmourn 'd for , my sad head</l>
     <l n="52">In a strange land goes friendless to the dead .</l>
     <l n="53">When thou hear'st this , O ! how thy faithful soul</l>
     <l n="54">Will sink , whilst grief doth ev'ry part control !</l>
     <l n="55">How often wilt thou look this way , and cry ,</l>
     <l n="56">O ! where is't yonder that my love doth lie ?</l>
     <l n="57">Yet spare these tears , and mourn not thou for me ,</l>
     <l n="58">Long since — dear heart !— have I been dead to thee .</l>
     <l n="59">Think then I died , when thee and Rome I lost ,</l>
     <l n="60">That death to me more grief than this hath cost .</l>
     <l n="61">Now , if thou canst — but thou canst not — best wife ,</l>
     <l n="62">Rejoice , my cares are ended with my life .</l>
     <l n="63">At least , yield not to sorrows , frequent use</l>
     <l n="64">Should make these miseries to thee no news .</l>
     <l n="65">And here I wish my soul died with my breath ,</l>
     <l n="66">And that no part of me were free from death ;</l>
     <l n="67">For , if it be immortal , and outlives</l>
     <l n="68">The body , as Pythagoras believes ,</l>
     <l n="69">Betwixt these Sarmates ’ ghosts , a Roman I</l>
     <l n="70">Shall wander , vex 'd to all eternity .</l>
     <l n="71">But thou — for after death I shall be free —</l>
     <l n="72">Fetch home these bones , and what is left of me ;</l>
     <l n="73">A few flow'rs give them , with some balm , and lay</l>
     <l n="74">Them in some suburb grave , hard by the way ;</l>
     <l n="75">And to inform posterity , who 's there ,</l>
     <l n="76">This sad inscription let my marble wear ;</l>
     <l n="77">“ Here lies the soft-soul 'd lecturer of love ,</l>
     <l n="78">Whose envi 'd wit did his own ruin prove .</l>
     <l n="79">But thou ,— whoe'er thou be'st , that , passing by ,</l>
     <l n="80">Lend'st to this sudden stone a hasty eye ,</l>
     <l n="81">If e'er thou knew'st of love the sweet disease ,</l>
     <l n="82">Grudge not to say , May Ovid rest in peace ! ”</l>
     <l n="83">This for my tomb : but in my books they 'll see</l>
     <l n="84">More strong and lasting monuments of me ,</l>
     <l n="85">Which I believe — though fatal — will afford</l>
     <l n="86">An endless name unto their ruin 'd lord .</l>
     <l n="87">And now thus gone , it rests , for love of me ,</l>
     <l n="88">Thou show'st some sorrow to my memory ;</l>
     <l n="89">Thy funeral off'rings to my ashes bear ,</l>
     <l n="90">With wreaths of cypress bath 'd in many a tear .</l>
     <l n="91">Though nothing there but dust of me remain ,</l>
     <l n="92">Yet shall that dust perceive thy pious pain .</l>
     <l n="93">But I have done , and my tir 'd , sickly head ,</l>
     <l n="94">Though I would fain write more , desires the bed ;</l>
     <l n="95">Take then this word — perhaps my last — to tell ,</l>
     <l n="96">Which though I want , I wish it thee , farewell !</l>

     <l n="53">For grief and absence do but edge desire ,</l>
     <l n="54">And death is fuel to a lover 's fire .</l>
     <l n="55">To see these trophies of his wanton bow ,</l>

     <l n="59">With noise the quiet air . This sudden stir</l>
     <l n="60">Betrays his godship , and as we from far</l>
     <l n="61">A clouded , sickly moon observe , so they</l>
     <l n="62">Through the false mists his eclips 'd torch betray .</l>
     <l n="63">A hot pursuit they make , and , though with care</l>
     <l n="64">And a slow wing , he softly stems the air ,</l>
     <l n="65">Yet they — as subtle now as he — surround</l>
     <l n="66">His silenc 'd course , and with the thick night bound</l>
     <l n="67">Surprise the wag . As in a dream we strive</l>
     <l n="68">To voice our thoughts , and vainly would revive</l>
     <l n="69">Our entranc 'd tongues , but cannot speech enlarge ,</l>
     <l n="70">‘ Till the soul wakes and reassumes her charge ;</l>
     <l n="71">So , joyous of their prize , they flock about</l>
     <l n="72">And vainly swell with an imagin 'd shout .</l>
     <l n="73">Far in these shades and melancholy coasts</l>
     <l n="74">A myrtle grows , well known to all the ghosts ,</l>
     <l n="75">Whose stretch 'd top — like a great man rais 'd by Fate —</l>
     <l n="76">Looks big , and scorns his neighbour 's low estate ;</l>
     <l n="77">His leafy arms into a green cloud twist ,</l>
     <l n="78">And on each branch doth sit a lazy mist ,</l>
     <l n="79">A fatal tree , and luckless to the gods ,</l>
     <l n="80">Where for disdain in life — Love 's worst of odds —</l>
     <l n="81">The queen of shades , fair Proserpine , did rack</l>
     <l n="82">The sad Adonis : hither now they pack</l>
     <l n="83">This little god , where , first disarm 'd , they bind</l>
     <l n="84">His skittish wings , then both his hands behind</l>
     <l n="85">His back they tie , and thus secur 'd at last ,</l>
     <l n="86">The peevish wanton to the tree make fast .</l>
     <l n="87">Here at adventure , without judge or jury ,</l>
     <l n="88">He is condemn 'd , while with united fury</l>
     <l n="89">They all assail him . As a thief at bar</l>
     <l n="90">Left to the law , and mercy of his star ,</l>
     <l n="91">Hath bills heap 'd on him , and is question 'd there</l>
     <l n="92">By all the men that have been robb 'd that year ;</l>
     <l n="93">So now whatever Fate or their own will</l>
     <l n="94">Scor 'd up in life , Cupid must pay the bill .</l>
     <l n="95">Their servant 's falsehood , jealousy , disdain ,</l>
     <l n="96">And all the plagues that abus 'd maids can feign ,</l>
     <l n="97">Are laid on him , and then to heighten spleen ,</l>
     <l n="98">Their own deaths crown the sum . Press 'd thus between</l>
     <l n="99">His fair accusers , ‘ tis at last decreed</l>
     <l n="100">He by those weapons , that they died , should bleed .</l>
     <l n="101">One grasps an airy sword , a second holds</l>
     <l n="102">Illusive fire , and in vain wanton folds</l>
     <l n="103">Belies a flame ; others , less kind , appear</l>
     <l n="104">To let him blood , and from the purple tear</l>
     <l n="105">Create a rose . But Sappho all this while</l>
     <l n="106">Harvests the air , and from a thicken 'd pile</l>
     <l n="107">Of clouds like Leucas top spreads underneath</l>
     <l n="108">A sea of mists ; the peaceful billows breathe</l>
     <l n="109">Without all noise , yet so exactly move</l>
     <l n="110">They seem to chide , but distant from above</l>
     <l n="111">Reach not the ear , and — thus prepar 'd — at once</l>
     <l n="112">She doth o'erwhelm him with the airy sconce .</l>
     <l n="113">Amidst these tumults , and as fierce as they ,</l>
     <l n="114">Venus steps in , and without thought or stay</l>
     <l n="115">Invades her son ; her old disgrace is cast</l>
     <l n="116">Into the bill , when Mars and she made fast</l>
     <l n="117">In their embraces were expos 'd to all</l>
     <l n="118">The scene of gods , stark naked in their fall .</l>
     <l n="119">Nor serves a verbal penance , but with haste</l>
     <l n="120">From her fair brow — O happy flow'rs so plac 'd !—</l>
     <l n="121">She tears a rosy garland , and with this</l>
     <l n="122">Whips the untoward boy ; they gently kiss</l>
     <l n="123">His snowy skin , but she with angry haste</l>
     <l n="124">Doubles her strength , until bedew 'd at last</l>
     <l n="125">With a thin bloody sweat , their innate red ,</l>
     <l n="126">— As if griev 'd with the act — grew pale and dead .</l>
     <l n="127">This laid their spleen ; and now — kind souls — no more</l>
     <l n="128">They 'll punish him ; the torture that he bore</l>
     <l n="129">Seems greater than his crime ; with joint consent</l>
     <l n="130">Fate is made guilty , and he innocent .</l>
     <l n="131">As in a dream with dangers we contest ,</l>
     <l n="132">And fictious pains seem to afflict our rest ,</l>
     <l n="133">So , frighted only in these shades of night ,</l>
     <l n="134">Cupid — got loose — stole to the upper light ,</l>
     <l n="135">Where ever since — for malice unto these —</l>
     <l n="136">The spiteful ape doth either sex displease .</l>
     <l n="137">But O ! that had these ladies been so wise</l>

     <l n="44">The stars shine in the silent sky ,</l>

     <l n="49">Where with his Saviour he would be</l>
     <l n="50">Lifted above mortality .</l>
     <l n="51">Meanwhile the golden stars do set ,</l>
     <l n="52">And the slow pilgrim leave all wet</l>
     <l n="53">With his own tears , which flow so fast</l>
     <l n="54">They make his sleeps light , and soon past .</l>
     <l n="55">By this , the sun o'er night deceas 'd</l>
     <l n="56">Breaks in fresh blushes from the East ,</l>
     <l n="57">When , mindful of his former falls ,</l>
     <l n="58">With strong cries to his God he calls ,</l>
     <l n="59">And with such deep-drawn sighs doth move</l>
     <l n="60">That He turns anger into love .</l>
     <l n="61">In the calm Spring , when the Earth bears ,</l>
     <l n="62">And feeds on April 's breath and tears ,</l>
     <l n="63">His eyes , accustom 'd to the skies ,</l>
     <l n="64">Find here fresh objects , and like spies</l>
     <l n="65">Or busy bees , search the soft flow'rs ,</l>
     <l n="66">Contemplate the green fields and bow'rs ,</l>
     <l n="67">Where he in veils and shades doth see</l>
     <l n="68">The back parts of the Deity .</l>
     <l n="69">Then sadly sighing says , “ O ! how</l>
     <l n="70">These flow'rs with hasty , stretch 'd heads grow</l>
     <l n="71">And strive for heav'n , but rooted here</l>
     <l n="72">Lament the distance with a tear !</l>
     <l n="73">The honeysuckles clad in white ,</l>
     <l n="74">The rose in red , point to the light ;</l>
     <l n="75">And the lilies , hollow and bleak ,</l>
     <l n="76">Look as if they would something speak ;</l>
     <l n="77">They sigh at night to each soft gale ,</l>
     <l n="78">And at the day-spring weep it all .</l>
     <l n="79">Shall I then only — wretched I !—</l>
     <l n="80">Oppress 'd with earth , on earth still lie ? ”</l>
     <l n="81">Thus speaks he to the neighbour trees ,</l>
     <l n="82">And many sad soliloquies</l>
     <l n="83">To springs and fountains doth impart ,</l>
     <l n="84">Seeking God with a longing heart .</l>
     <l n="85">But if to ease his busy breast</l>
     <l n="86">He thinks of home , and taking rest ,</l>
     <l n="87">A rural cot and common fare</l>
     <l n="88">Are all his cordials against care .</l>
     <l n="89">There at the door of his low cell ,</l>
     <l n="90">Under some shade , or near some well</l>
     <l n="91">Where the cool poplar grows , his plate</l>
     <l n="92">Of common earth without more state</l>
     <l n="93">Expect their lord . Salt in a shell ,</l>
     <l n="94">Green cheese , thin beer , draughts that will tell</l>
     <l n="95">No tales , a hospitable cup ,</l>
     <l n="96">With some fresh berries , do make up</l>
     <l n="97">His healthful feast ; nor doth he wish</l>
     <l n="98">For the fat carp , or a rare dish</l>
     <l n="99">Of Lucrine oysters ; the swift quist</l>
     <l n="100">Or pigeon sometimes — if he list —</l>
     <l n="101">With the slow goose that loves the stream ,</l>
     <l n="102">Fresh , various salads , and the bean</l>
     <l n="103">By curious palates never sought ,</l>
     <l n="104">And , to close with , some cheap unbought</l>
     <l n="105">Dish for digestion , are the most</l>
     <l n="106">And choicest dainties he can boast .</l>
     <l n="107">Thus feasted , to the flow'ry groves</l>
     <l n="108">Or pleasant rivers he removes ,</l>
     <l n="109">Where near some fair oak , hung with mast ,</l>
     <l n="110">He shuns the South 's infectious blast .</l>
     <l n="111">On shady banks sometimes he lies ,</l>
     <l n="112">Sometimes the open current tries ,</l>
     <l n="113">Where with his line and feather 'd fly</l>
     <l n="114">He sports , and takes the scaly fry .</l>
     <l n="115">Meanwhile each hollow wood and hill</l>
     <l n="116">Doth ring with lowings long and shrill ,</l>
     <l n="117">And shady lakes with rivers deep</l>
     <l n="118">Echo the bleating of the sheep ;</l>
     <l n="119">The blackbird with the pleasant thrush</l>
     <l n="120">And nightingale in ev'ry bush</l>
     <l n="121">Choice music give , and shepherds play</l>
     <l n="122">Unto their flock some loving lay !</l>
     <l n="123">The thirsty reapers , in thick throngs ,</l>
     <l n="124">Return home from the field with songs ,</l>
     <l n="125">And the carts , laden with ripe corn ,</l>
     <l n="126">Come groaning to the well-stor 'd barn .</l>
     <l n="127">Nor pass we by , as the least good ,</l>
     <l n="128">A peaceful , loving neighbourhood ,</l>
     <l n="129">Whose honest wit , and chaste discourse</l>
     <l n="130">Make none — by hearing it — the worse ,</l>
     <l n="131">But innocent and merry , may</l>
     <l n="132">Help — without sin — to spend the day .</l>
     <l n="133">Could now the tyrant usurer ,</l>
     <l n="134">Who plots to be a purchaser</l>
     <l n="135">Of his poor neighbour 's seat , but taste</l>
     <l n="136">These true delights , O ! with what haste</l>
     <l n="137">And hatred of his ways , would he</l>
     <l n="138">Renounce his Jewish cruelty ,</l>
     <l n="139">And those curs 'd sums , which poor men borrow</l>

     <l n="2">TO THE MOST HONOURABLE AND TRULY NOBLE HENRY , LORD MARQUIS AND EARL OF</l>
     <l n="3">WORCESTER , &amp; c .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">My Lord ,</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Though dedications are now become a kind of tyranny over the peace and repose of great men ; yet I have confidence I shall so manage the present address as to entertain your lordship without much disturbance ; and because my purposes are governed by deep respect and veneration , I hope to find your Lordship more facile and accessible . And I am already absolved from a great part of that fulsome and designing guilt , being sufficiently removed from the causes of it : for I consider , my Lord , that you are already so well known to the world in your several characters and advantages of honour — it was yours by traduction , and the adjunct of your nativity ; you were swaddled and rocked i n't , bred up and grew i n't , to your now wonderful height and eminence — that for me under pretence of the inscription , to give you the heraldry of your family , or to carry your person through the famed topics of mind , body , or estate , were all one as to persuade the world that fire and light were very bright bodies , or that the luminaries themselves had glory . In point of protection I beg to fall in with the common wont , and to be satisfied by the reasonableness of the thing , and abundant worthy precedents ; and although I should have secret prophecy and assurance that the ensuing verse would live eternally , yet would I , as I now do , humbly crave it might be fortified with your patronage ; for so the sextile aspects and influences are watched for , and applied to the actions of life , thereby to make the scheme and good auguries of the birth pass into Fate , and a success infallible .</p>
   <p>My Lord , by a happy obliging intercession , and your own consequent indulgence , I have now recourse to your Lordship , hoping I shall not much displease by putting these twin poets into your hands . The minion and vertical planet of the Roman lustre and bravery , was never better pleased than when he had a whole constellation about him : not his finishing five several wars to the promoting of his own interest , nor particularly the prodigious success at Actium where he held in chase the wealth , beauty and prowess of the East ; not the triumphs and absolute dominions which followed : all this gave him not half that serene pride and satisfaction of spirit as when he retired himself to umpire the different excellencies of his insipid friends , and to distribute laurels among his poetic heroes . If now upon the authority of this and several such examples , I had the ability and opportunity of drawing the value and strange worth of a poet , and withal of applying some of the lineaments to the following pieces , I should then do myself a real service , and atone in a great measure for the present insolence . But best of all will it serve my defence and interest , to appeal to your Lordship 's own conceptions and image of genuine verse ; with which so just , so regular original , if these copies shall hold proportion and resemblance , then am I advanced very far in your Lordship 's pardon : the rest will entirely be supplied me by your Lordship 's goodness , and my own awful zeal of being , my Lord ,</p>
   <p>Your Lordship 's most obedient , most humbly devoted servant ,</p>
   <p>J. W .</p>
   <p>TO THE READER .</p>
   <p>The Nation of Poets above all Writers has ever challenged perpetuity of name , or as they please by their charter of liberty to call it , Immortality . Nor has the World much disputed their claim , either easily resigning a patrimony in itself not very substantial ; or , it may be , out of despair to control the authority of inspiration and oracle . Howsoever the price as now quarrelled for among the poets themselves is no such rich bargain : it is only a vanishing interest in the lees and dregs of Time , in the rear of those Fathers and Worthies in the art , who if they know anything of the heats and fury of their successors , must extremely pity them .</p>
   <p>I am to assure , that the Author has no portion of that airy happiness to lose , by any injury or unkindness which may be done to his Verse : his reputation is better built in the sentiment of several judicious persons , who know him very well able to give himself a lasting monument , by undertaking any argument of note in the whole circle of learning .</p>
   <p>But even these his Diversions have been valuable with the matchless Orinda ; and since they deserved her esteem and commendations , who so thinks them not worth the publishing , will put himself in the opposite scale , where his own arrogance will blow him up .</p>

     <l n="7">And pay each other a full self-return ,</l>
     <l n="8">May laugh , though all such metaphysics burn .</l>

     <l n="14">As if that power but from one side came ,</l>
     <l n="15">Which both unites ; yet , where there is no sense</l>
     <l n="16">There is no passion , nor intelligence :</l>
     <l n="17">And so by consequence we cannot state</l>
     <l n="18">A commerce , unless both we animate .</l>

     <l n="23">‘ Tis then no heresy to end the strife</l>

     <l n="30">Effectual informing influence .</l>
     <l n="31">Since then ‘ tis clear , that friendship is nought else</l>
     <l n="32">But a joint , kind propension , and excess</l>
     <l n="33">In none , but such whose equal , easy hearts</l>
     <l n="34">Comply and meet both in their whole and parts ,</l>
     <l n="35">And when they cannot meet , do not forget</l>
     <l n="36">To mingle souls , but secretly reflect</l>
     <l n="37">And some third place their centre make , where they</l>
     <l n="38">Silently mix , and make an unseen stay :</l>
     <l n="39">Let me not say — though poets may be bold —</l>

     <l n="44">Heaves gently , and salutes the hopeful East :</l>
     <l n="45">So from thy quiet cell , the retir 'd throne</l>

     <l n="47">Our sad distractions , come ! and richly dress 'd</l>
     <l n="48">With reverend mirth and manners , check the rest</l>

     <l n="5">He that an eagle 's powers would rehearse</l>

     <l n="18">Below of all thy miracles the sphere .</l>
     <l n="19">If poets ought may add unto thy store ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thou hast in heav'n of wonders many more .</l>
     <l n="21">For when just Jove to earth his thunder bends ,</l>
     <l n="22">And from that bright , eternal fortress sends</l>
     <l n="23">His louder volleys , straight this bird doth fly</l>
     <l n="24">To Ætna , where his magazine doth lie ,</l>
     <l n="25">And in his active talons brings him more</l>
     <l n="26">Of ammunition , and recruits his store .</l>
     <l n="27">Nor is't a low or easy lift . He soars</l>
     <l n="28">‘ Bove wind and fire ; gets to the moon , and pores</l>
     <l n="29">With scorn upon her duller face ; for she</l>
     <l n="30">Gives him but shadows and obscurity .</l>
     <l n="31">Here much displeas 'd , that anything like night</l>
     <l n="32">Should meet him in his proud and lofty flight ,</l>
     <l n="33">That such dull tinctures should advance so far ,</l>
     <l n="34">And rival in the glories of a star ,</l>
     <l n="35">Resolv 'd he is a nobler course to try ,</l>
     <l n="36">And measures out his voyage with his eye .</l>
     <l n="37">Then with such fury he begins his flight ,</l>
     <l n="38">As if his wings contended with his sight .</l>
     <l n="39">Leaving the moon , whose humble light doth trade</l>
     <l n="40">With spots , and deals most in the dark and shade ,</l>
     <l n="41">To the day 's royal planet he doth pass</l>
     <l n="42">With daring eyes , and makes the sun his glass .</l>
     <l n="43">Here doth he plume and dress himself , the beams</l>
     <l n="44">Rushing upon him like so many streams ;</l>
     <l n="45">While with direct looks he doth entertain</l>
     <l n="46">The thronging flames , and shoots them back again .</l>
     <l n="47">And thus from star to star he doth repair ,</l>
     <l n="48">And wantons in that pure and peaceful air .</l>
     <l n="49">Sometimes he frights the starry swan , and now</l>
     <l n="50">Orion 's fearful hare , and then the crow .</l>
     <l n="51">Then with the orb itself he moves , to see</l>
     <l n="52">Which is more swift , th ’ intelligence or he .</l>
     <l n="53">Thus with his wings his body he hath brought</l>
     <l n="54">Where man can travel only in a thought .</l>
     <l n="55">I will not seek , rare bird , what spirit ‘ tis</l>
     <l n="56">That mounts thee thus ; I 'll be content with this ,</l>
     <l n="57">To think that Nature made thee to express</l>

   <p>TO THE PIOUS MEMORY OF C [ HARLES ] W [ ALBEOFFE ] ESQUIRE , WHO FINISHED HIS COURSE HERE , AND MADE HIS ENTRANCE INTO IMMORTALITY UPON THE 13 OF SEPTEMBER , IN THE YEAR OF REDEMPTION , 1653 .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Now that the public sorrow doth subside ,</l>
     <l n="2">And those slight tears which custom springs are dried ;</l>
     <l n="3">While all the rich and outside mourners pass</l>
     <l n="4">Home from thy dust , to empty their own glass ;</l>
     <l n="5">I — who the throng affect not , nor their state —</l>
     <l n="6">Steal to thy grave undress 'd , to meditate</l>
     <l n="7">On our sad loss , accompanied by none ,</l>
     <l n="8">An obscure mourner that would weep alone .</l>
     <l n="9">So , when the world 's great luminary sets ,</l>
     <l n="10">Some scarce known star into the zenith gets ,</l>
     <l n="11">Twinkles and curls , a weak but willing spark ,</l>
     <l n="12">As glow-worms here do glitter in the dark .</l>
     <l n="13">Yet , since the dimmest flame that kindles there</l>
     <l n="14">An humble love unto the light doth bear ,</l>
     <l n="15">And true devotion from an hermit 's cell</l>
     <l n="16">Will Heav'n ' s kind King as soon reach and as well ,</l>
     <l n="17">As that which from rich shrines and altars flies ,</l>
     <l n="18">Led by ascending incense to the skies :</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Tis no malicious rudeness , if the might</l>
     <l n="20">Of love makes dark things wait upon the bright ,</l>
     <l n="21">And from my sad retirements calls me forth ,</l>
     <l n="22">The just recorder of thy death and worth .</l>
     <l n="23">Long didst thou live — if length be measured by</l>
     <l n="24">The tedious reign of our calamity —</l>
     <l n="25">And counter to all storms and changes still</l>
     <l n="26">Kept'st the same temper , and the selfsame will .</l>
     <l n="27">Though trials came as duly as the day ,</l>
     <l n="28">And in such mists , that none could see his way ,</l>
     <l n="29">Yet thee I found still virtuous , and saw</l>
     <l n="30">The sun give clouds , and Charles give both the law .</l>
     <l n="31">When private interest did all hearts bend ,</l>
     <l n="32">And wild dissents the public peace did rend ,</l>
     <l n="33">Thou , neither won , nor worn , wert still thyself ,</l>
     <l n="34">Not aw 'd by force , nor basely brib 'd with pelf .</l>
     <l n="35">What the insuperable stream of times</l>
     <l n="36">Did dash thee with , those suff'rings were , not crimes .</l>
     <l n="37">So the bright sun eclipses bears ; and we ,</l>
     <l n="38">Because then passive , blame him not . Should he</l>
     <l n="39">For enforc 'd shades , and the moon 's ruder veil</l>
     <l n="40">Much nearer us than him , be judg 'd to fail ?</l>
     <l n="41">Who traduce thee , so err . As poisons by</l>
     <l n="42">Correction are made antidotes , so thy</l>
     <l n="43">Just soul did turn ev'n hurtful things to good ,</l>
     <l n="44">Us 'd bad laws so they drew not tears , nor blood .</l>
     <l n="45">Heav'n was thy aim , and thy great , rare design</l>
     <l n="46">Was not to lord it here , but there to shine .</l>
     <l n="47">Earth nothing had , could tempt thee . All that e'er</l>
     <l n="48">Thou pray 'd'st for here was peace , and glory there .</l>
     <l n="49">For though thy course in Time 's long progress fell</l>
     <l n="50">On a sad age , when war and open 'd hell</l>
     <l n="51">Licens 'd all arts and sects , and made it free</l>
     <l n="52">To thrive by fraud , and blood , and blasphemy :</l>
     <l n="53">Yet thou thy just inheritance didst by</l>
     <l n="54">No sacrilege , nor pillage multiply .</l>
     <l n="55">No rapine swell 'd thy state , no bribes , nor fees ,</l>
     <l n="56">Our new oppressors ’ best annuities .</l>
     <l n="57">Such clean pure hands hadst thou ! and for thy heart ,</l>
     <l n="58">Man 's secret region , and his noblest part ;</l>
     <l n="59">Since I was privy to't , and had the key</l>
     <l n="60">Of that fair room , where thy bright spirit lay ,</l>
     <l n="61">I must affirm it did as much surpass</l>
     <l n="62">Most I have known , as the clear sky doth glass .</l>
     <l n="63">Constant and kind , and plain , and meek , and mild</l>
     <l n="64">It was , and with no new conceits defil 'd .</l>
     <l n="65">Busy , but sacred thoughts — like bees — did still</l>
     <l n="66">Within it stir , and strive unto that hill</l>
     <l n="67">Where redeem 'd spirits , evermore alive ,</l>
     <l n="68">After their work is done , ascend and hive .</l>
     <l n="69">No outward tumults reach 'd this inward place :</l>
     <l n="70">‘ Twas holy ground , where peace , and love , and grace</l>
     <l n="71">Kept house , where the immortal restless life ,</l>
     <l n="72">In a most dutiful and pious strife ,</l>
     <l n="73">Like a fix 'd watch , mov 'd all in order still ;</l>
     <l n="74">The will serv 'd God , and ev'ry sense the will !</l>
     <l n="75">In this safe state Death met thee , Death , which is</l>
     <l n="76">But a kind usher of the good to bliss ,</l>
     <l n="77">Therefore to weep because thy course is run ,</l>
     <l n="78">Or droop like flow'rs , which lately lost the sun ,</l>
     <l n="79">I cannot yield , since Faith will not permit</l>
     <l n="80">A tenure got by conquest to the pit .</l>
     <l n="81">For the great Victor fought for us , and He</l>
     <l n="82">Counts ev'ry dust that is laid up of thee .</l>
     <l n="83">Besides , Death now grows decrepit , and hath</l>
     <l n="84">Spent the most part both of its time and wrath .</l>
     <l n="85">That thick , black night , which mankind fear 'd , is torn</l>
     <l n="86">By troops of stars , and the bright day 's forlorn .</l>
     <l n="87">The next glad news — most glad unto the just !—</l>
     <l n="88">Will be the trumpet 's summons from the dust .</l>
     <l n="89">Then I 'll not grieve ; nay , more , I 'll not allow</l>
     <l n="90">My soul should think thee absent from me now .</l>
     <l n="91">Some bid their dead “ Good night ! ” but I will say</l>
     <l n="92">“ Good morrow to dear Charles ! ” for it is day .</l>

    <head>TO LYSIMACHUS , THE AUTHOR BEING WITH HIM IN LONDON .</head>
     <l n="1">Saw not , Lysimachus , last day , when we</l>
     <l n="2">Took the pure air in its simplicity ,</l>
     <l n="3">And our own too , how the trimm 'd gallants went</l>
     <l n="4">Cringing , and pass 'd each step some compliment ?</l>
     <l n="5">What strange , fantastic diagrams they drew</l>
     <l n="6">With legs and arms ; the like we never knew</l>
     <l n="7">In Euclid , Archimede , nor all of those</l>
     <l n="8">Whose learnèd lines are neither verse nor prose ?</l>
     <l n="9">What store of lace was there ? how did the gold</l>
     <l n="10">Run in rich traces , but withal made bold</l>
     <l n="11">To measure the proud things , and so deride</l>
     <l n="12">The fops with that , which was part of their pride ?</l>

     <l n="16">To yoke ourselves for their sedans , and state ?</l>

     <l n="29">When these in their profuse moods spend the night ,</l>
     <l n="30">With the same sins they drive away the light .</l>
     <l n="31">Thy learnèd thrift puts her to use , while she</l>
     <l n="32">Reveals her fiery volume unto thee ;</l>
     <l n="33">And looking on the separated skies ,</l>
     <l n="34">And their clear lamps , with careful thoughts and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="35">Thou break'st through Nature 's upmost rooms and bars</l>
     <l n="36">To heav'n , and there conversest with the stars .</l>
     <l n="37">Well fare such harmless , happy nights , that be</l>
     <l n="38">Obscur 'd with nothing but their privacy ,</l>
     <l n="39">And missing but the false world 's glories do</l>
     <l n="40">Miss all those vices which attend them too !</l>
     <l n="41">Fret not to hear their ill-got , ill-giv'n praise ;</l>

     <l n="90">But young and brisk ; the bounds of both these lives ,</l>
     <l n="91">With very little space between the same ,</l>
     <l n="92">Were parted only by the middle flame .</l>
     <l n="93">To Nilus straight he goes to consecrate</l>
     <l n="94">His parent 's ghost ; his mind is to translate</l>
     <l n="95">His dust to Egypt . Now he hastes away</l>
     <l n="96">Into a distant land , and doth convey</l>
     <l n="97">The ashes in a turf . Birds do attend</l>
     <l n="98">His journey without number , and defend</l>
     <l n="99">His pious flight , like to a guard ; the sky</l>

     <l n="101">Nor is there one of all those thousands dares</l>

     <l n="109">In pearls and habit ; he adorns his head</l>
     <l n="110">With royal tires : his steed with gold is led ;</l>
     <l n="111">His robes , for which the scarlet fish is sought ,</l>
     <l n="112">With rare Assyrian needle-work are wrought ;</l>
     <l n="113">And proudly reigning o'er his rascal bands ,</l>
     <l n="114">He raves and triumphs in his large commands .</l>
     <l n="115">A city of Egypt , famous in all lands</l>
     <l n="116">For rites , adores the sun ; his temple stands</l>
     <l n="117">There on a hundred pillars by account ,</l>
     <l n="118">Digg 'd from the quarries of the Theban mount .</l>
     <l n="119">Here , as the custom did require — they say —</l>

     <l n="123">Unto the altars thus he destinates</l>
     <l n="124">His own remains ; the light doth gild the gates ;</l>
     <l n="125">Perfumes divine the censers up do send :</l>
     <l n="126">While th ’ Indian odour doth itself extend</l>

     <l n="131">O happy bird ! sole heir to thy own dust !</l>
     <l n="132">Death , to whose force all other creatures must</l>

    <head>POEMS WITH THE TENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL ENGLISHED .</head>
    <head>Most of the poems in this volume of 1646 appear to belong to Vaughan 's sojourn as a law-student in London : that , however , on the Priory Grove must have been written after he had retired to Wales on the outbreak of the Civil War .</head>
     <l n="1">P. 5 . To my Ingenious Friend , R. W .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is probable that this is the R. W. of the Elegy in Olor Iscanus ( p. 79 ) . On the attempts to identify him , see the note to that poem . The Poems of 1646 must have been published while his fate was still unknown .</p>
   <p>Pints i ’ th ’ Moon or Star . These are names of rooms , rather than of inns . Cf . Shakespeare , 1 Henry IV ., ii . 4 , 30 , “ Anon , anon , sir ! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon . ”</p>
   <p>P. 6 . Randolph .</p>
   <p>The works of Randolph here referred to are his comedy The Jealous Lovers , his pastoral Amyntas ; or , The Impossible Dowry , and the following verses On the Death of a Nightingale :—</p>

   <p>The MS. variant readings to this and to two of the following poems are written in pencil on a copy of the Poems in the British Museum , having the press-mark 12304 , a 24 . There is no indication of their author , or of the source from which they are taken .</p>

   <p>The Globe Tavern . This appears to have been near , or even a part of , the famous theatre . There exists a forged letter of George Peele 's , in which it is mentioned as a resort of Shakespeare 's , but there is no authentic allusion to it by name earlier than an entry in the registers of St. Saviour 's , Southwark , for 1637 . An “ alehouse ” is , however , alluded to in a ballad on the burning of the old Globe in 1613 . ( Rendle and Norman , Inns of Old Southwark , p . 326 . )</p>
   <p>Tower-Wharf to Cymbeline and Lud ; that is , from the extreme east to the extreme west of the City . Statues of the mythical kings of Britain were set up in 1260 in niches on Ludgate . They were renewed when the gate was rebuilt in 1586 . It stood near the Church of St. Martin 's , Ludgate .</p>
   <p>That made his horse a senator ; i. e . Caligula . Cf . Suetonius Vit .

   <p>P. 21 . To Amoret .</p>
   <p>The third stanza is closely modelled on Donne ; cf . Introduction ( vol . i ., p. xxi ) . The curious reader may detect many other traces of Donne 's manner of writing in these Poems of 1646 .</p>
   <p>P. 23 . To Amoret Weeping .</p>
   <p>Eat orphans ... patent it . The ambition of a courtier under the Stuarts was to get the guardianship of a royal ward , or the grant of a monopoly in some article of necessity . Dr. Grosart quotes from Tustin 's Observations ; or , Conscience Emblem ( 1646 ): “ By me , John Tustin , who hath been plundered and spoiled by the patentees for white and grey soap , eighteen several times , to his utter undoing . ”</p>
   <p>P. 26 . Upon the Priory Grove , his usual Retirement .</p>
   <p>Mr. Beeching , in the Introduction ( vol . i ., p. xxiii ) , states following Dr. Grosart , that the Priory Grove was “ the home of a famous poetess of the day , Katherine Phillips , better known as ‘ the Matchless Orinda . ’ ” Vaughan was certainly a friend of Mrs. Phillips ( cf . pp . 100 , 164 , 211 , with notes ) , whose husband , Colonel James Phillips , lived at the Priory , Cardigan ; but she was not married until 1647 .</p>
   <p>Miss Morgan points out that there is still a wood on the outskirts of Brecon which is known as the Priory Grove . It is near the church and remains of a Benedictine Priory on the Honddu .</p>

    <head>This volume , published in 1651 , contains , besides the poems here reprinted , some prose translations from Plutarch and other writers . The separate title-pages of these are given in the Bibliography ( vol . ii ., p. lviii ): the incidental scraps of verse in them appear on pp . 291-293 of the present volume . The edition of 1651 has , besides the printed title-page , an engraved title-page by the well-known engraver , who may or may not have been a kinsman of the poet , Robert Vaughan .

   <p>Nec manus atra fuit . Dr. Grosart omitted the fuit , together with the final s of the preceding line . In this he is naïvely followed by Mr. J. R. Tutin , in his selection of Vaughan 's Secular Poems .</p>
   <p>P. 53 . To the ... Lord Kildare Digby .</p>
   <p>Lord Kildare Digby was the eldest son of Robert , first Baron Digby , in the peerage of Ireland . He succeeded to the title in 1642 . He was about 21 at the time of this dedication , and died in 1661 ( Dr. Grosart )</p>
   <p>The date of the dedication is 17th of December , 1647 . A volume was therefore probably prepared for publication at that date , and afterwards , as we learn from the publisher 's preface , “ condemned to obscurity , ” and given surreptitiously to the world . At the same time , as Miss Morgan points out to me , some of the poems in Olor Iscanus must be of later date than 1647 . The death of Charles I. is apparently alluded to in the lines Ad Posteros , and certainly in the “ since Charles his reign ” of the Invitation to Brecknock ( p. 74 ) . This event took place on January 30th , 1648 / 9 . The Epitaph upon the Lady Elizabeth ( p. 102 ) , again , cannot be earlier than her death on September 8th , 1650 .</p>
   <p>P. 54 . The Publisher to the Reader .</p>
   <p>Augustus vindex . The lives of Vergil attributed to Donatus and others relate that the poet , in his will , directed that his unfinished Aeneid should be burnt . Augustus , however , interfered and ordered its publication .</p>

     <l n="6">Rector of Cantreff and Vicar of Brecknock , but was ejected by the</l>
     <l n="7">Commissioners for the Propagation of the Gospel and went abroad . At the</l>
     <l n="8">Restoration he returned to Cantreff and was made D. D . and Canon of St .</l>
     <l n="9">David 's . But for his death , on the 31st December , 1660 , he would</l>
     <l n="10">probably have become Bishop of Bristol . He was the author of several</l>
     <l n="11">books of no great importance . He appears to have been a close friend of</l>

Either he or his father , James Rowlandson , also of Queen 's College , was sequestered by the Westminster Assembly to the vicarage of Battle , Sussex , in 1644 . He left it shortly after and “ returned to his benefice from whence he was before thence driven by the forces raised against the parliament . ” ( See Addl . MS. 15 , 669 , f. 17 ) . There was also another James Rowlandson , son of James Rowlandson , D. D ., Canon of Windsor , who matriculated from Queen 's College on the 9th November , 1632 , aged 17 , and took his B.

   <p>Miss Morgan thinks that the “ friend ” of this poem , whose name is shown by the first line to have been James , may perhaps be identified with the James Howell of the Epistolae Ho-Elianae . Howell had Vaughans amongst his cousins and correspondents , but these appear to have been of the Golden Grove family .</p>

   <p>Since Charles his reign . This poem must date from after the execution of Charles I ., on January 30 , 1648 / 9 . It would appear therefore that Vaughan was living in Brecknock and not at Newton about the time that the Olor Iscanus was published .</p>
   <p>P. 77 . Monsieur Gombauld .</p>
   <p>The writer referred to is John Ogier de Gombauld ( 1567-1666 ) . His prose tale of Endymion was translated by Richard Hurst in 1637 . Ismena and Diophania who was metamorphosed into a myrtle , are characters in the story . Periardes is a hill in Armenia whence the Euphrates takes its course .</p>
   <p>P. 79 . An Elegy on the Death of Mr. R. W ., slain in the late unfortunate differences at Routon Heath , near Chester .</p>
   <p>The battle of Routon , or Rowton , Heath took place on September 24 , 1645 . The Royalist forces , under Charles I. and Sir Marmaduke Langdale , advancing to raise the siege of Chester , were met and routed by the Parliamentarians under Poyntz . The contemporary pamphlets give a long list of the prisoners taken at Routon Heath , but name hardly any of those slain . It is therefore difficult to say who R. W ., evidently a dear friend of Vaughan 's , may have been . He appears to have been missing for a year before he was finally given up . From lines 25-27 we learn that he was a young man of only twenty . The most likely suggestion for his identification seems to me that of Mr. C. H. Firth , who points out to me that the name of one Roger Wood occurs in the list of Catholics who fell in the King 's service as having been slain at Chester . Miss Southall ( Songs of Siluria , 1890 , p. 124 ) suggests that he may have been either Richard Williams , a nephew of Sir Henry Williams , of Gwernyfed , who died unmarried , or else a son of Richard Winter , of Llangoed . He might also , I think , have been one of Vaughan 's wife 's family , the Wises , and possibly also a Walbeoffe . A reference to the Walbeoffe pedigree in the note to p. 189 will show that there was a Robert Walbeoffe , brother of C. W. Miss Morgan thinks that he is a generation too old , and that the unnamed son of C. W ., who , according to his tombstone , did not survive him , may have been a Robert , and the R. W. in question . On the question whether Vaughan was himself present at Routon Heath , see the Biographical Note ( vol . ii ., p. xxviii ) .</p>

   <p>craggy Biston , and the fatal Dee . Chester stands , of course , on the Dee , which is “ fatal ” as the scene of disasters to the Royalist cause . Dr. Grosart explains Biston as “ Bishton ( or Bishopstone ) in Monmouthshire , ” and adds , “ ‘ Craggie Biston ’ refers , no doubt , to certain caves there . The Poet 's school-boy rambles from Llangattock doubtless included Bishton . ” I think that Biston is clearly Beeston Castle , one of the outlying defences of Chester , which played a considerable part in the siege . It surrendered on November 5 , 1645 , and the small garrison was permitted to march to Denbigh ( J. R. Phillips , The Civil War in Wales and the Marshes , vol . i ., p. 343 ) .</p>

The poems of Orinda were surreptitiously published in 1664 , and in an authorised version in 1667 . They include her poem on Vaughan , afterwards prefixed to Thalia Rediviva ( cf . p. 169 ) , but are not accompanied by the present verses nor by those to her editor in Thalia Rediviva ( p. 211 ) .</p>

   <p>P. 189 . To the pious Memory of C [ harles ] W [ albeoffe ] Esquire .</p>
   <p>Charles Walbeoffe was a man of considerable importance in Brecknockshire . His name occurs several times in State papers of the period . A petition of his concerning a ward is dated October 12 , 1640 . ( Cal . S. P . Dom ., Car . I ., 470 , 113 ) . He was High Sheriff in 1648 ( Harl . MS. 2 , 289 , f. 174 ) , and a fragment of a warrant signed by him on April 17 of that year to Thomas Vaughan , treasurer of the county , for the monthly assessment , is in Harl . MS. 6 , 831 , f. 13 . As we might perhaps gather from Vaughan 's poem , he does not seem to have taken an active part in the Civil War . He did not , like some other members of his family , sign the Declaration of Brecknock for the Parliament on November 23 , 1645 ( J. R. Phillips , Civil War in Wales and the Marches , ii . 284 ) . And he seems to have joined the Royalist rising in Wales of 1648 . Information was laid on February 10 , 1649 , that he “ was Commissioner of Array and Association , raised men and money , subscribed warrants to raise men against the Parliament 's generals , and sat as J. P. in the court at Brecon when the friends of Parliament were prosecuted ” ( Cal . Proc . Ctee . for Advance of Money , p. 1017 ) . Afterwards he was reconciled , sat on the local Committee for Compositions , and again got into trouble with the authorities . On May 14 , 1652 , the Brecon Committee wrote to the Central Committee that , being one of the late Committee , he would not account for sums in his hands . He was fined £ 20 . ( Cal . Proc .

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Here lieth the body of Charles Walbeoffe , Esqre ., who departed this life the 13th day of September , 1653 , and was married to Mary , one of the daughters of Sir Thomas Aubrey of Llantryddid , in the county of Glamorgan , Knt ., by whom he had issue two sonnes , of whom only Charles surviveth . ”</p>
   <p>Charles Walbeoffe the younger died in 1668 , and was succeeded by his cousin John . “ This gentleman , ” says Jones ( Hist . of Brecknock , ii ., 482 ) , “ being of a gay and extravagant turn , left the estate , much encumbered , to his son Charles , and soon after his death it was foreclosed and afterwards sold . ”</p>
   <p>This John Walbeoffe is mentioned in Thomas Vaughan 's Diary ( cf . vol . ii ., p. xxxviii ) . He may be the writer of the preface to Thalia Rediviva ( cf . p. 164 , note ) .</p>
   <p>It is possible that the R. W. of another of Vaughan 's Elegies may also have been a Walbeoffe . Cf . p. 79 , note .</p>

     <l n="1">Dr. Grosart was unable to identify the initials C. W. The Walbeoffes , or</l>

   <p>P. 193 . In Zodiacum Marcelli Palingenii .</p>
   <p>Marcellus Palingenius , or Petro Angelo Manzoli , wrote his didactic and satirical poem , the Zodiacus Vitae , about 1535 . It was translated into English by Barnabee Googe in 1560-1565 . The latest edition of the original is that by C. C. Weise ( 1832 ) . As we may gather from Vaughan 's lines , Manzoli was an earnest student of occult lore . Cf . Gustave Reynier , De Marcelli Palingenii Stellatae Poctae Zodiaco Vitae ( 1893 ) .</p>

     <l n="23">P. 214 . To Etesia ( for Timander ) The First Sight .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I do not think we need look for anything autobiographical in this and the following poems written to Etesia . They are written “ for Timander , ” that is , either to serve the suit of a friend , or as copies of verses with no personal reference at all . The names Etesia and Timander smack of Orinda 's poetic circle .</p>
   <p>P. 224 . Translations from Severinus .</p>
   <p>Dr. Grosart hunted out an obscure Neapolitan , Marcus Aurelius Severino , and ascribed to him the originals of these translations . They are of course from the De Consolatione Philosophiae of Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius , and are a continuation of the pieces already printed in Olor Iscanus ( pp . 125-143 ) .</p>
   <p>P. 245 . Pious Thoughts and Ejaculations .</p>
   <p>These are much in the vein of Silex Scintillans . They probably belong to various dates later than 1655 , when the second part of that collection appeared . The Nativity ( p. 259 ) is dated 1656 , and The True Christmas ( p. 261 ) was apparently written after the Restoration .</p>
   <p>P. 261 . The True Christmas .</p>
   <p>Vaughan was no Puritan ; cf . his lines on Christ 's Nativity ( vol . i ., p. 107 ) —</p>

    <head>FRAGMENTS AND TRANSLATIONS .</head>
    <head>The larger number of the verses in this section are translated quotations scattered through Vaughan 's prose-pamphlets . Dr. Grosart identified some of the originals ; I have added a few others ; but the larger number remain obscure and are hardly worth spending much labour upon . The title-pages of the pamphlets will be found in the Bibliography ( vol . ii ., p. lvii ) .</head>
     <l n="1">P. 289 . From Eucharistica Oxoniensia .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have already , in the Biographical Note ( vol . ii ., p. xxviii ) , given reasons for doubting whether this poem is by the Silurist . It was first printed as his by Dr. Grosart . Charles the First was in Scotland , trying to settle his differences with the Scots , during the closing months of 1641 .</p>
   <p>P. 291 . Translations from Plutarch and Maximus Tyrius .</p>
   <p>These , together with a translation of Guevara 's De vitae rusticae laudibus , were appended to the Olor Iscanus . Vaughan did not translate directly from the Greek , but from a Latin version published in 1613-14 amongst some tracts by John Reynolds , Lecturer in Greek at , and afterwards President of Corpus Christi College , Oxford .</p>
   <p>P. 294 . From the Mount of Olives .</p>
   <p>A volume of Devotions published by Vaughan in 1652 . The preface , dated 1st October , 1651 , is addressed to Sir Charles Egerton , Knight , and in it Vaughan speaks of “ that near relation by which my dearest friend lays claim to your person . ” It is impossible to say who is the “ dearest friend ” referred to . The Flores Solitudinis ( 1654 ) is also dedicated to Sir Charles Egerton . He was probably of Staffordshire . Dr. Grosart ( II . xxxiii ) states that in Hanbury Church , co. Stafford , is a monument Caroli Egertoni Equitis Aurati , who died 1662 . Perhaps therefore he was connected with Vaughan 's wife 's family , the Wises of Staffordshire .</p>
   <p>P. 298 . From Man in Glory .</p>
   <p>This translation from a work attributed to St. Anselm and published as his in 1639 is appended to the Mount of Olives .</p>
   <p>In the original lines 5 , 6 , are printed in error after lines 7 , 8 .</p>

   <p>This original life of S. Paulinus of Nola , by far the most striking of Vaughan 's prose works , contains a number of poems , pieced together by Vaughan from lines in Paulinus ’ own poems and in those of Ausonius addressed to him . The edition used by Vaughan seems to have been that published by Rosweyd at Antwerp in 1622 . I have traced the sources of the poems so far as I can in the edition published by W. de Hartel in the Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum ( vols . xxix , xxx 1894 ) .</p>
   <p>P. 322 . From Hermetical Physic .</p>

   <p>This tract is bound up with the Brit . Mus . copy of [ Thomas Powell 's ] Quadriga Salutis ( 1657 ) , of which it appears to be a Welsh translation . The verses , to which nothing corresponds in the English version , are signed Ol [ or ] Vaughan ( cf . Olor Iscanus ) . Professor Palgrave ( Y Cymrodor , 1890-1 ) translates them as follows : “ The Lord 's Prayer , when looked into ( we see ) , the Trinity of His Fatherly goodness has given it as a foundation-stone of all prayer , and has made it for our instruction in doctrine . ” He adds that this Englyn occurs with others written in an eighteenth-century hand on the fly-leaf of a MS. of Welsh poetry by Iago ab Duwi .</p>
   <p>P. 324 . From Humane Industry .</p>
   <p>On Thomas Powell cf . p. 57 , note . The first three of these translations are marked H. V. in the margin ; of the fourth Powell says , “ The translation of Mr. Hen . Vaughan , Silurist , whose excellent Poems are published . ” Many other translations are scattered through the book , but there is nothing to connect them with Vaughan .</p>
