    <head>THE FALCON</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I RECOLLECT , that lately much I blamed ,</l>
     <l n="2">The sort of lover , avaricious named ;</l>
     <l n="3">And if in opposites we reason see ,</l>
     <l n="4">The liberal in paradise should be .</l>
     <l n="5">The rule is just and , with the warmest zeal ,</l>
     <l n="6">To prove the fact I to the CHURCH appeal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">IN Florence once there dwelled a gentle youth ,</l>
     <l n="8">Who loved a certain beauteous belle with truth ;</l>
     <l n="9">O'er all his actions she had full controul ;—</l>
     <l n="10">To please he would have sold his very soul .</l>
     <l n="11">If she amusements wished , he 'd lavish gold ,</l>
     <l n="12">Convinced in love or war you should be bold ;</l>
     <l n="13">The cash ne'er spare :— invincible its pow'rs ,</l>
     <l n="14">O'erturning walls or doors where'er it show'rs .</l>
     <l n="15">The precious ore can every thing o'ercome ;</l>
     <l n="16">‘ Twill silence barking curs : make servants dumb ;</l>
     <l n="17">And these can render eloquent at will :—</l>
     <l n="18">Excel e'en Tully in persuasive skill ;</l>
     <l n="19">In short he 'd leave no quarter unsubdued ,</l>
     <l n="20">Unless therein the fair he could include .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">SHE stood th ’ attack howe'er , and Frederick failed ;</l>
     <l n="22">His force was vain whenever he assailed ;</l>
     <l n="23">Without the least return his wealth he spent :</l>
     <l n="24">Lands , houses , manors of immense extent ,</l>
     <l n="25">Were ev'ry now and then to auction brought ;</l>
     <l n="26">To gratify his love was all he thought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="27">THE rank of ‘ squire till lately he had claimed ;</l>
     <l n="28">Now scarcely was he even mister named ;</l>
     <l n="29">Of wealth by Cupid 's stratagems bereft ,</l>
     <l n="30">A single farm was all the man had left ;</l>
     <l n="31">Friends very few , and such as God alone ,</l>
     <l n="32">Could tell if friendship they might not disown ;</l>
     <l n="33">The best were led their pity to express ;</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Twas all he got : it could not well be less ;</l>
     <l n="35">To lend without security was wrong ,</l>
     <l n="36">And former favours they 'd forgotten long ;</l>
     <l n="37">With all that Frederick could or say or do ,</l>
     <l n="38">His liberal conduct soon was lost to view .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">WITH Clytia he no longer was received ,</l>
     <l n="40">Than while he was a man of wealth believed ;</l>
     <l n="41">Balls , concerts , op'ras , tournaments , and plays ,</l>
     <l n="42">Expensive dresses , all engaging ways ,</l>
     <l n="43">Were used to captivate this lady fair ,</l>
     <l n="44">While scarcely one around but in despair ,</l>
     <l n="45">Wife , widow , maid , his fond affection sought ;</l>
     <l n="46">To gain him , ev'ry wily art was brought ;</l>
     <l n="47">But all in vain :— by passion overpow'red ,</l>
     <l n="48">The belle , whose conduct others would have soured ,</l>
     <l n="49">To him appeared a goddess full of charms ,</l>
     <l n="50">Superior e'en to Helen , in his arms ;</l>
     <l n="51">From whence we may conclude , the beauteous dame</l>
     <l n="52">Was always deaf to Fred'rick ' s ardent flame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="53">ENAMOURED of the belle , his lands he sold ;</l>
     <l n="54">The family estates were turned to gold ;</l>
     <l n="55">And many who the purchases had made ,</l>
     <l n="56">With pelf accumulated by their trade ,</l>
     <l n="57">Assumed the airs of men of noble birth :—</l>
     <l n="58">Fair subjects oft for ridicule and mirth !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="59">RICH Clytia was , and her good spouse , ‘ tis said ,</l>
     <l n="60">Had lands which far and wide around were spread ;</l>
     <l n="61">No cash nor presents she would ever take ,</l>
     <l n="62">Yet suffered Frederick splendid treats to make ,</l>
     <l n="63">Without designing recompense to grant ,</l>
     <l n="64">Or being more than merely complaisant .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">ALREADY , if my mem'ry do not fail ,</l>
     <l n="66">I 've said , the youth 's estates were put to sale ,</l>
     <l n="67">To pay for feasts the fair to entertain ,</l>
     <l n="68">And what he 'd left was only one domain ,</l>
     <l n="69">A petty farm to which he now retired ;</l>
     <l n="70">Ashamed to show where once so much admired ,</l>
     <l n="71">And wretched too , a prey to lorn despair ,</l>
     <l n="72">Unable to obtain by splendid care ,</l>
     <l n="73">A beauty he 'd pursued six years and more ,</l>
     <l n="74">And should for ever fervently adore .</l>
     <l n="75">His want of merit was the cause he thought ,</l>
     <l n="76">That she could never to his wish be brought ,</l>
     <l n="77">While from him not a syllable was heard ,</l>
     <l n="78">Against the lovely belle his soul preferred .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="79">‘ MID poverty oft Fred'rick sighed and wept ;</l>
     <l n="80">A toothless hag — his only servant kept ;</l>
     <l n="81">His kitchen cold ; ( where commonly he dwelled ;)</l>
     <l n="82">A pretty decent horse his stable held ;</l>
     <l n="83">A falcon too ; and round about the grange ,</l>
     <l n="84">Our quondam ‘ squire repeatedly would range ,</l>
     <l n="85">Where oft , to melancholy , he was led ,</l>
     <l n="86">To sacrifice the game which near him fed ;</l>
     <l n="87">By Clytia 's cruelty the gun was seized ,</l>
     <l n="88">And feathered victims black chagrin appeased .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="89">‘ TWAS thus the lover whiled his hours away ;</l>
     <l n="90">His heart-felt torments nothing could allay ;</l>
     <l n="91">Blessed if with fortune love he 'd also lost ,</l>
     <l n="92">Which constantly his earthly comforts crossed ;</l>
     <l n="93">But this lorn passion preyed upon his mind :—</l>
     <l n="94">Where'er he rode , BLACK CARE would mount behind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="95">DEATH took at length the husband of the fair ;</l>
     <l n="96">An only son appointed was his heir ,</l>
     <l n="97">A sickly child , whose life , ‘ twas pretty plain ,</l>
     <l n="98">Could scarcely last till spring returned again ,</l>
     <l n="99">Which made the husband , by his will , decree ,</l>
     <l n="100">His wife the infant 's successor should be ,</l>
     <l n="101">In case the babe at early years should die ,</l>
     <l n="102">Who soon grew worse and raised the widow 's sigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="103">TOO much affection parents ne'er can show :—</l>
     <l n="104">A mother 's feelings none but mothers know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="105">FAIR Clytia round her child with anxious care ,</l>
     <l n="106">Watched day and night , and no expense would spare ;</l>
     <l n="107">Inquired if this or that would please his taste ;</l>
     <l n="108">What he desired should be procured with haste ;</l>
     <l n="109">But nothing would he have that she proposed ;</l>
     <l n="110">An ardent wish howe'er the boy disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="111">For Fred'rick ' s Falcon , and most anxious grew :—</l>
     <l n="112">Tear followed tear , and nothing else would do .</l>
     <l n="113">When once a child has got a whim in brain ,</l>
     <l n="114">No peace , no rest , till he the boon obtain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="115">WE should observe our belle , near Fred'rick ' s cot ,</l>
     <l n="116">A handsome house and many lands had got ;</l>
     <l n="117">‘ Twas there the lovely babe had lately heard ,</l>
     <l n="118">Most wondrous stories of the bird averred ;</l>
     <l n="119">No partridge e'er escaped its rapid wing :—</l>
     <l n="120">On every morn down numbers it would bring ;</l>
     <l n="121">No money for it would its owner take ;</l>
     <l n="122">Much grieved was Clytia such request to make .</l>
     <l n="123">The man , for her , of wealth had been bereft ;</l>
     <l n="124">How ask the only treasure he had left ?</l>
     <l n="125">And him if she were led to importune ,</l>
     <l n="126">Could she expect that he 'd accord the boon ?</l>
     <l n="127">Alas ! ungratefully she oft repaid ,</l>
     <l n="128">His liberal treats , his concerts , serenade ,</l>
     <l n="129">And haughtily behaved from first to last :</l>
     <l n="130">How be so bold , ( reflecting on the past ,)</l>
     <l n="131">To see the man that she so ill had used ?</l>
     <l n="132">And ask a favour ?— could she be excused ?</l>
     <l n="133">But then her child !— perhaps his life ‘ twould save ;</l>
     <l n="134">Naught would he take ; the falcon she must crave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="135">THAT her sweet babe might be induced to eat ,</l>
     <l n="136">So meant the bird of Fred'rick to intreat ;</l>
     <l n="137">Her boy was heard continually to cry ,</l>
     <l n="138">Unless he had the falcon , he should die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="139">THESE reasons strongly with the mother weighed ;</l>
     <l n="140">Her visit to the ‘ squire was not delayed ;</l>
     <l n="141">With fond affection for her darling heir ,</l>
     <l n="142">One morn , alone she sought the lorn repair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="143">TO Fred'rick ' s eye an angel she appeared ;</l>
     <l n="144">But shame he felt , that she , his soul revered ,</l>
     <l n="145">Should find him poor :— no servants to attend ,</l>
     <l n="146">Nor means to give a dinner to a friend .</l>
     <l n="147">The poverty in which he now was viewed ,</l>
     <l n="148">Distressed his mind and all his griefs renewed .</l>
     <l n="149">Why come ? said he ; what led you thus to trace ,</l>
     <l n="150">An humble slave of your celestial face ?</l>
     <l n="151">A villager , a wretched being here ;</l>
     <l n="152">Too great the honour doubtless must appear ;</l>
     <l n="153">‘ Twas somewhere else you surely meant to go ?</l>
     <l n="154">The lady in a moment answered no .</l>
     <l n="155">Cried he , I 've neither cook nor kettle left ;</l>
     <l n="156">Then how can I receive you , thus bereft ?</l>
     <l n="157">But you have bread , said Clytia :— that will do ;—</l>
     <l n="158">The lover quickly to the poultry flew ,</l>
     <l n="159">In search of eggs ; some bacon too he found ;</l>
     <l n="160">But nothing else , except the hawk renowned ,</l>
     <l n="161">Which caught his eye , and instantly was seized ,</l>
     <l n="162">Slain , plucked , and made a fricassee that pleased .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="163">MEANWHILE the house-keeper for linen sought ;</l>
     <l n="164">Knives , forks , plates , spoons , cups , glass and chairs she</l>
     <l n="165">brought ;</l>
     <l n="166">The fricassee was served , the dame partook ,</l>
     <l n="167">And on the dish with pleasure seemed to look .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="168">THE dinner o'er , the widow then resolved ,</l>
     <l n="169">To ask the boon which in her mind resolved .</l>
     <l n="170">She thus begun :— good sir , you 'll think me mad ,</l>
     <l n="171">To come and to your breast fresh trouble add ;</l>
     <l n="172">I 've much to ask , and you will feel surprise ,</l>
     <l n="173">That one , for whom your love could ne'er suffice ,</l>
     <l n="174">Should now request your celebrated bird ;</l>
     <l n="175">Can I expect the grant ?— the thought ‘ s absurd</l>
     <l n="176">But pardon pray a mother 's anxious fear ;</l>
     <l n="177">‘ Tis for my child :— his life to me is dear .</l>
     <l n="178">The falcon solely can the infant save ;</l>
     <l n="179">Yet since to you I nothing ever gave ,</l>
     <l n="180">For all your kindness oft on me bestowed ;</l>
     <l n="181">Your fortune wasted :— e'en your nice abode ,</l>
     <l n="182">Alas ! disposed of , large supplies to raise ,</l>
     <l n="183">To entertain and please in various ways :</l>
     <l n="184">I cannot hope this falcon to obtain ;</l>
     <l n="185">For sure I am the expectation 's vane ;</l>
     <l n="186">No , rather perish child and mother too ;</l>
     <l n="187">Than such uneasiness should you pursue :</l>
     <l n="188">Allow howe'er this parent , I beseech ,</l>
     <l n="189">Who loves her offspring ‘ yond the pow'r of speech ,</l>
     <l n="190">Or language to express , her only boy ,</l>
     <l n="191">Sole hope , sole comfort , all her earthly joy ,</l>
     <l n="192">True mother like , to seek her child 's relief ,</l>
     <l n="193">And in your breast deposit now her grief .</l>
     <l n="194">Affection 's pow'r none better know than you ,—</l>
     <l n="195">How few to love were ever half so true !</l>
     <l n="196">From such a bosom I may pardon crave</l>
     <l n="197">Soft pity 's ever with the good and brave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="198">ALAS ! the wretched lover straight replied ,</l>
     <l n="199">The bird was all I could for you provide ;</l>
     <l n="200">‘ Twas served for dinner .— Dead ?— exclaimed the dame ,</l>
     <l n="201">While trembling terror overspread her frame .</l>
     <l n="202">No jest , said he , and from the soul I wish ,</l>
     <l n="203">My heart , instead of that , had been the dish ;</l>
     <l n="204">But doomed alas ! am I by fate , ‘ tis clear ,</l>
     <l n="205">To find no grace with her my soul holds dear :</l>
     <l n="206">I 'd nothing left ; and when I saw the bird ,</l>
     <l n="207">To kill it instantly the thought occurred ;</l>
     <l n="208">Those naught we grudge nor spare to entertain ,</l>
     <l n="209">Who o'er our feeling bosoms sov'reign reign :</l>
     <l n="210">All I can do is speedily to get ,</l>
     <l n="211">Another falcon : easily they 're met ;</l>
     <l n="212">And by to-morrow I 'll the bird procure .</l>
     <l n="213">No , Fred'rick , she replied , I now conjure</l>
     <l n="214">You 'll think no more about it ; what you 've done</l>
     <l n="215">Is all that fondness could have shown a son ;</l>
     <l n="216">And whether fate has doomed the child to die ,</l>
     <l n="217">Or with my prayers the pow'rs above comply ;</l>
     <l n="218">For you my gratitude will never end —</l>
     <l n="219">Pray let us hope to see you as a friend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="220">THEN Clytia took her leave , and gave her hand ;</l>
     <l n="221">A proof his love no more she would withstand .</l>
     <l n="222">He kissed and bathed her fingers with his tears ;</l>
     <l n="223">The second day grim death confirmed their fears :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="224">THE mourning lasted long and mother 's grief ;</l>
     <l n="225">But days and months at length bestowed relief ;</l>
     <l n="226">No wretchedness so great , we may depend ,</l>
     <l n="227">But what , to time 's all-conqu'ring sithe will bend :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="228">TWO famed physicians managed with such care ;</l>
     <l n="229">That they recovered her from wild despair ,</l>
     <l n="230">And tears gave place to cheerfulness and joy : -</l>
     <l n="231">The one was TIME the other Venus ’ Boy .</l>
     <l n="232">Her hand fair Clytia on the youth bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="233">As much from love as what to him she owed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="234">LET not this instance howsoe'r mislead ;</l>
     <l n="235">‘ Twere wrong with hope our fond desires to feed ,</l>
     <l n="236">And waste our substance thus :— not all the FAIR ,</l>
     <l n="237">Possess of gratitude a decent share .</l>
     <l n="238">With this exception they appear divine ;</l>
     <l n="239">In lovely WOMAN angel-charms combine ;</l>
     <l n="240">The whole indeed I do not here include ;</l>
     <l n="241">Alas ; too many act the jilt and prude .</l>
     <l n="242">When kind , they 're ev'ry blessing found below :</l>
     <l n="243">When otherwise a curse we often know .</l>

    <head>THE LITTLE DOG</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE key , which opes the chest of hoarded gold .</l>
     <l n="2">Unlocks the heart that favours would withhold .</l>
     <l n="3">To this the god of love has oft recourse ,</l>
     <l n="4">When arrows fail to reach the secret source ,</l>
     <l n="5">And I 'll maintain he 's right , for , ‘ mong mankind ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nice presents ev'ry where we pleasing find ;</l>
     <l n="7">Kings , princes , potentates , receive the same ,</l>
     <l n="8">And when a lady thinks she 's not to blame ,</l>
     <l n="9">To do what custom tolerates around ;</l>
     <l n="10">When Venus ’ acts are only Themis ’ found ,</l>
     <l n="11">I 'll nothing ‘ gainst her say ; more faults than one ,</l>
     <l n="12">Besides the present , have their course begun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">A MANTUAN judge espoused a beauteous fair :</l>
     <l n="14">Her name was Argia :— Anselm was her care ,</l>
     <l n="15">An aged dotard , trembling with alarms ,</l>
     <l n="16">While she was young , and blessed with seraph charms .</l>
     <l n="17">But , not content with such a pleasing prize ,</l>
     <l n="18">His jealousy appeared without disguise ,</l>
     <l n="19">Which greater admiration round her drew ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who doubtless merited , in ev'ry view ,</l>
     <l n="21">Attention from the first in rank or place</l>
     <l n="22">So elegant her form , so fine her face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">‘ TWOULD endless prove , and nothing would avail ,</l>
     <l n="24">Each lover 's pain minutely to detail :</l>
     <l n="25">Their arts and wiles ; enough ‘ twill be no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="26">To say the lady 's heart was found so stout ,</l>
     <l n="27">She let them sigh their precious hours away ,</l>
     <l n="28">And scarcely seemed emotion to betray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">WHILE at the judge 's , Cupid was employed ,</l>
     <l n="30">Some weighty things the Mantuan state annoyed ,</l>
     <l n="31">Of such importance , that the rulers meant ,</l>
     <l n="32">An embassy should to the Pope be sent .</l>
     <l n="33">As Anselm was a judge of high degree ,</l>
     <l n="34">No one so well embassador could be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">‘ TWAS with reluctance he agreed to go ,</l>
     <l n="36">And be at Rome their mighty Plenipo ’ ;</l>
     <l n="37">The business would be long , and he must dwell</l>
     <l n="38">Six months or more abroad , he could not tell .</l>
     <l n="39">Though great the honour , he should leave his dove ,</l>
     <l n="40">Which would be painful to connubial love .</l>
     <l n="41">Long embassies and journeys far from home</l>
     <l n="42">Oft cuckoldom around induce to roam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="43">THE husband , full of fears about his wife ;</l>
     <l n="44">Exclaimed — my ever — darling , precious life ,</l>
     <l n="45">I must away ; adieu , be faithful pray ,</l>
     <l n="46">To one whose heart from you can never stray</l>
     <l n="47">But swear to me , my duck , ( for , truth to tell ,</l>
     <l n="48">I 've reason to be jealous of my belle ,)</l>
     <l n="49">Now swear these sparks , whose ardour I perceive ,</l>
     <l n="50">Have sighed without success , and I 'll believe .</l>
     <l n="51">But still your honour better to secure ,</l>
     <l n="52">From slander 's tongue , and virtue to ensure ,</l>
     <l n="53">I 'd have you to our country-house repair ;</l>
     <l n="54">The city quit :— these sly gallants beware ;</l>
     <l n="55">Their presents too , accurst invention found ,</l>
     <l n="56">With danger fraught , and ever much renowned ;</l>
     <l n="57">For always in the world , where lovers move ,</l>
     <l n="58">These gifts the parent of assentment prove .</l>
     <l n="59">‘ Gainst those declare at once ; nor lend an ear</l>
     <l n="60">To flattery , their cunning sister-peer .</l>
     <l n="61">If they approach , shut straight both ears and eyes ;</l>
     <l n="62">For nothing you shall want that wealth supplies ;</l>
     <l n="63">My store you may command ; the key behold ,</l>
     <l n="64">Where I 've deposited my notes and gold .</l>
     <l n="65">Receive my rents ; expend whate'er you please ;</l>
     <l n="66">I 'll look for no accounts ; live quite at ease ;</l>
     <l n="67">I shall be satisfied with what you do ,</l>
     <l n="68">If naught therein to raise a blush I view ;</l>
     <l n="69">You 've full permission to amuse your mind ;</l>
     <l n="70">Your love , howe'er , for me alone 's designed ;</l>
     <l n="71">That , recollect , must be for my return ,</l>
     <l n="72">For which our bosoms will with ardour burn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="73">THE good man 's bounty seemingly was sweet ;</l>
     <l n="74">All pleasures , one excepted , she might greet ;</l>
     <l n="75">But that , alas ! by bosoms unpossessed ,</l>
     <l n="76">No happiness arises from the rest :</l>
     <l n="77">His lady promised ev'ry thing required :—</l>
     <l n="78">Deaf , blind , and cruel ,— whosoe'er admired ;</l>
     <l n="79">And not a present would her hand receive</l>
     <l n="80">At his return , he fully might believe ,</l>
     <l n="81">She would be found the same as when he went ,</l>
     <l n="82">Without gallant , or aught to discontent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="83">HER husband gone , she presently retired</l>
     <l n="84">Where Anselm had so earnestly desired ;</l>
     <l n="85">The lovers came , but they were soon dismissed ,</l>
     <l n="86">And told , from visits they must all desist ;</l>
     <l n="87">Their assiduities were irksome grown ,</l>
     <l n="88">And she was weary of their lovesick tone .</l>
     <l n="89">Save one , they all were odious to the fair ;</l>
     <l n="90">A handsome youth , with smart engaging air ;</l>
     <l n="91">But whose attentions to the belle were vain ;</l>
     <l n="92">In spite of arts , his aim he could not gain ;</l>
     <l n="93">His name was Atis , known to love and arms ,</l>
     <l n="94">Who grudged no pains , could he possess her charms .</l>
     <l n="95">Each wile he tried , and if he 'd kept to sighs ,</l>
     <l n="96">No doubt the source is one that never dries ;</l>
     <l n="97">But often diff'rent with expense ‘ tis found ;</l>
     <l n="98">His wealth was wasted rapidly around</l>
     <l n="99">He wretched grew ; at length for debt he fled ,</l>
     <l n="100">And sought a desert to conceal his head .</l>
     <l n="101">As on the road he moved , a clown he met ,</l>
     <l n="102">Who with his stick an adder tried to get ,</l>
     <l n="103">From out a thicket , where it hissing lay ,</l>
     <l n="104">And hoped to drive the countryman away :</l>
     <l n="105">Our knight his object asked ; the clown replied ,</l>
     <l n="106">To slay the reptile anxiously I tried ;</l>
     <l n="107">Wherever met , an adder I would kill :</l>
     <l n="108">The race should be extinct if I 'd my will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="109">WHY would'st thou , friend , said Atis , these destroy ?</l>
     <l n="110">God meant that all should freely life enjoy .</l>
     <l n="111">The youthful knight for reptiles had , we find ,</l>
     <l n="112">Less dread than what prevails with human kind ;</l>
     <l n="113">He bore them in his arms :— they marked his birth ;</l>
     <l n="114">From noble Cadmus sprung , who , when on earth ,</l>
     <l n="115">At last , to serpent was in age transformed ;</l>
     <l n="116">The adder 's bush the clown no longer stormed ;</l>
     <l n="117">No more the spotted reptile sought to stay ,</l>
     <l n="118">But seized the time , and quickly crept away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="119">AT length our lover to a wood retired ;</l>
     <l n="120">To live concealed was what the youth desired ;</l>
     <l n="121">Lorn silence reigned , except from birds that sang ,</l>
     <l n="122">And dells that oft with sweetest echo rang .</l>
     <l n="123">There HAPPINESS and frightful MIS'RY lay ,</l>
     <l n="124">Quite undistinguished : classed with beasts of prey ;</l>
     <l n="125">That growling prowled in search of food around :</l>
     <l n="126">There Atis consolation never found .</l>
     <l n="127">LOVE thither followed , and , however viewed ,</l>
     <l n="128">‘ Twas vain to hope his passion to elude ;</l>
     <l n="129">Retirement fed the tender , ardent flame ,</l>
     <l n="130">And irksome ev'ry minute soon became .</l>
     <l n="131">Let us return , cried he , since such our fate :</l>
     <l n="132">‘ Tis better , Atis , bear her frowns and hate ,</l>
     <l n="133">Than of her beauteous features lose the view ;</l>
     <l n="134">Ye nightingales and streams , ye woods adieu !</l>
     <l n="135">When far from her I neither see nor hear :</l>
     <l n="136">‘ Tis she alone my senses still revere ;</l>
     <l n="137">A slave I am , who fled her dire disdain ;</l>
     <l n="138">Yet seek once more to wear the cruel chain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="139">AS near some noble walls our knight arrived ,</l>
     <l n="140">Which fairy-hands to raise had once contrived ,</l>
     <l n="141">His eyes beheld , at peep of early morn ,</l>
     <l n="142">When bright Aurora 's beams the earth adorn ,</l>
     <l n="143">A beauteous nymph in royal robes attired ,</l>
     <l n="144">Of noble mien , and formed to be admired ,</l>
     <l n="145">Who t'ward him drew , with pleasing , gracious air ,</l>
     <l n="146">While he was wrapped in thought , a prey to care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="147">SAID she , I 'd have you , Atis , happy be ;</l>
     <l n="148">‘ Tis in my pow'r , and this I hope to see ;</l>
     <l n="149">A fairy greet me , Manto is my name :—</l>
     <l n="150">Your friend , and one you 've served unknown :— the same</l>
     <l n="151">My fame you 've heard , no doubt ; from me proceeds</l>
     <l n="152">The Mantuan town , renowned for ancient deeds ;</l>
     <l n="153">In days of yore I these foundations laid ,</l>
     <l n="154">Which in duration , equal I have made ,</l>
     <l n="155">To those of Memphis , where the Nile 's proud course</l>
     <l n="156">Majestically flows from hidden source .</l>
     <l n="157">The cruel Parcae are to us unknown ;</l>
     <l n="158">We wond'rous magick pow'rs have often shown ;</l>
     <l n="159">But wretched , spite of this , appears our lot</l>
     <l n="160">Death never comes , though various ills we 've got ,</l>
     <l n="161">For we to human maladies are prone ,</l>
     <l n="162">And suffer greatly oft , I freely own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="163">ONCE , in each week to serpents we are changed ;</l>
     <l n="164">Do you remember how you here arranged ,</l>
     <l n="165">To save an adder from a clown 's attack ?</l>
     <l n="166">‘ Twas I , the furious rustick wished to hack ,</l>
     <l n="167">When you assisted me to get away ;</l>
     <l n="168">For recompense , my friend , without delay ,</l>
     <l n="169">I 'll you procure the kindness of the fair ,</l>
     <l n="170">Who makes you love and drives you to despair :</l>
     <l n="171">We 'll go and see her :— be assured from me ,</l>
     <l n="172">Before two days are passed , as I foresee ,</l>
     <l n="173">You 'll gain , by presents , Argia and the rest ,</l>
     <l n="174">Who round her watch , and are the suitor 's pest .</l>
     <l n="175">Grudge no expense , be gen'rous , and be bold ,</l>
     <l n="176">Your handfuls scatter , lavish be of gold .</l>
     <l n="177">Assured you shall not want the precious ore ;</l>
     <l n="178">For I command the whole of Plutus ’ store ,</l>
     <l n="179">Preserved , to please me , in the shades below ;</l>
     <l n="180">This charmer soon our magick pow'r shall know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="181">THE better to approach the cruel belle ,</l>
     <l n="182">And to your suit her prompt consent compel ,</l>
     <l n="183">Myself transformed you 'll presently perceive ;</l>
     <l n="184">And , as a little dog , I 'll much achieve ,</l>
     <l n="185">Around and round I 'll gambol o'er the lawn ,</l>
     <l n="186">And ev'ry way attempt to please and fawn ,</l>
     <l n="187">While you , a pilgrim , shall the bag-pipe play ;</l>
     <l n="188">Come , bring me to the dame without delay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="189">NO sooner said , the lover quickly changed ,</l>
     <l n="190">Together with the fairy , as arranged ;</l>
     <l n="191">A pilgrim he , like Orpheus , piped and sang ;</l>
     <l n="192">While Manto , as a dog , skipt , jumped , and sprang .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="193">THEY thus proceeded to the beauteous dame ;</l>
     <l n="194">Soon valets , maids , and others round them came ;</l>
     <l n="195">The dog and pilgrim gave extreme delight</l>
     <l n="196">And all were quite diverted at the sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="197">THE lady heard the noise , and sent her maid ,</l>
     <l n="198">To learn the reason why they romped and played :</l>
     <l n="199">She soon returned and told the lovely belle ,</l>
     <l n="200">A spaniel danced , and even spoke so well ,</l>
     <l n="201">it ev'ry thing could fully understand ,</l>
     <l n="202">And showed obedience to the least command .</l>
     <l n="203">‘ Twere better come herself and take a view :</l>
     <l n="204">The things were wond'rous that the dog could do .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="205">THE dame at any price the dog would buy ,</l>
     <l n="206">In case the master should the boon deny .</l>
     <l n="207">To give the dog our pilgrim was desired ;</l>
     <l n="208">But though he would not grant the thing required ;</l>
     <l n="209">He whispered to the maid the price he 'd take ,</l>
     <l n="210">And some proposals was induced to make .</l>
     <l n="211">Said he , ‘ tis true , the creature ‘ s not for sale ;</l>
     <l n="212">Nor would I give it : prayers will ne'er prevail ;</l>
     <l n="213">Whate'er I chance to want from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="214">It furnishes without the least delay .</l>
     <l n="215">To have my wish , three words alone I use ,</l>
     <l n="216">Its paw I squeeze , and whatsoe'er I choose ,</l>
     <l n="217">Of gold , or jewels , fall upon the ground ;</l>
     <l n="218">Search all the world , there 's nothing like it found .</l>
     <l n="219">Your lady 's rich , and money does not want ;</l>
     <l n="220">Howe'er , my little dog to her I 'll grant</l>
     <l n="221">If she 'll a night permit me in her bed ,</l>
     <l n="222">The treasure shall at once to her be led .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="223">THE maid at this proposal felt surprise ;</l>
     <l n="224">Her mistress truly ! less might well suffice ;</l>
     <l n="225">A paltry knave ! cried she , it makes me laugh ;</l>
     <l n="226">What ! take within her bed a pilgrim 's staff !</l>
     <l n="227">Were such a circumstance abroad to get ,</l>
     <l n="228">My lady would with ridicule be met ;</l>
     <l n="229">The dog and master , probably , were last</l>
     <l n="230">Beneath a hedge , or on a dunghill cast ;</l>
     <l n="231">A house like this they 'll never see agen ;—</l>
     <l n="232">But then the master is the pride of men ,</l>
     <l n="233">And that in love is ev'ry thing we find</l>
     <l n="234">Much wealth and beauty please all womankind !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="235">HIS features and his mien the knight had changed ;</l>
     <l n="236">Each air and look for conquest were arranged .</l>
     <l n="237">The maid exclaimed : when such a lover sues ,</l>
     <l n="238">How can a woman any thing refuse ?</l>
     <l n="239">Besides the pilgrim has a dog , ‘ tis plain ,</l>
     <l n="240">Not all the wealth of China could obtain .</l>
     <l n="241">Yet to possess my lady for a night ,</l>
     <l n="242">Would to the master be supreme delight :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="243">I SHOULD have mentioned , that our cunning spark ;</l>
     <l n="244">The dog would whisper ( feigning some remark ,)</l>
     <l n="245">On which ten ducats tumbled at his feet ;</l>
     <l n="246">These Atis gave the maid , ( O deed discreet ;)</l>
     <l n="247">Then fell a diamond : this our wily wight</l>
     <l n="248">Took up , and smiling at the precious sight ,</l>
     <l n="249">Said he , what now I hold I beg you 'll bear ,</l>
     <l n="250">To her you serve , so worthy of your care ;</l>
     <l n="251">Present my compliments , and to her say ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="253">THU female quickly to her mistress went ;</l>
     <l n="254">Our charming little dog to represent :</l>
     <l n="255">The various pow'rs displayed , and wonders done ;</l>
     <l n="256">Yet scarcely had she on the knight begun ,</l>
     <l n="257">And mentioned what he wished her to unfold ,</l>
     <l n="258">But Argia could her rage no longer hold ;</l>
     <l n="259">A fellow ! to presume , cried she , to speak</l>
     <l n="260">Of me with freedom !— I am not so weak ,</l>
     <l n="261">To listen to such infamy , not I</l>
     <l n="262">A pilgrim too !— no , you may well rely ,</l>
     <l n="263">E'en were he Atis , it would be the same ,</l>
     <l n="264">To whom I now my cruel conduct blame :</l>
     <l n="265">Such things he never would to me propose ;</l>

     <l n="271">Ambassadress my rank ! and to admit</l>
     <l n="272">A fellow , only for the gallows fit !</l>

     <l n="273">THIS pilgrim , cried the maid , has got the means</l>

     <l n="276">He 's worth a thousand Atis 's ‘ tis plain .</l>
     <l n="277">Bur , said the wife , my husband made me vow .</l>
     <l n="278">What ? cried the maid , you 'd not bedeck his brow !</l>
     <l n="279">A pretty promise truly :— can you think ,</l>
     <l n="280">You less from this , than from the first , should shrink ?</l>
