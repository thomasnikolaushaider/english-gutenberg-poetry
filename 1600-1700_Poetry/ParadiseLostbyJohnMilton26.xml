   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Of Man 's first disobedience , and the fruit</l>
     <l n="2">Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste</l>
     <l n="3">Brought death into the World , and all our woe ,</l>
     <l n="4">With loss of Eden , till one greater Man</l>
     <l n="5">Restore us , and regain the blissful seat ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sing , Heavenly Muse , that , on the secret top</l>
     <l n="7">Of Oreb , or of Sinai , didst inspire</l>
     <l n="8">That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed</l>
     <l n="9">In the beginning how the heavens and earth</l>
     <l n="10">Rose out of Chaos : or , if Sion hill</l>
     <l n="11">Delight thee more , and Siloa 's brook that flowed</l>
     <l n="12">Fast by the oracle of God , I thence</l>
     <l n="13">Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song ,</l>
     <l n="14">That with no middle flight intends to soar</l>
     <l n="15">Above th ’ Aonian mount , while it pursues</l>
     <l n="16">Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme .</l>
     <l n="17">And chiefly thou , O Spirit , that dost prefer</l>
     <l n="18">Before all temples th ’ upright heart and pure ,</l>
     <l n="19">Instruct me , for thou know'st ; thou from the first</l>
     <l n="20">Wast present , and , with mighty wings outspread ,</l>
     <l n="21">Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss ,</l>
     <l n="22">And mad'st it pregnant : what in me is dark</l>
     <l n="23">Illumine , what is low raise and support ;</l>
     <l n="24">That , to the height of this great argument ,</l>
     <l n="25">I may assert Eternal Providence ,</l>
     <l n="26">And justify the ways of God to men .</l>
     <l n="27">Say first — for Heaven hides nothing from thy view ,</l>
     <l n="28">Nor the deep tract of Hell — say first what cause</l>
     <l n="29">Moved our grand parents , in that happy state ,</l>
     <l n="30">Favoured of Heaven so highly , to fall off</l>
     <l n="31">From their Creator , and transgress his will</l>
     <l n="32">For one restraint , lords of the World besides .</l>
     <l n="33">Who first seduced them to that foul revolt ?</l>
     <l n="34">Th ’ infernal Serpent ; he it was whose guile ,</l>
     <l n="35">Stirred up with envy and revenge , deceived</l>
     <l n="36">The mother of mankind , what time his pride</l>
     <l n="37">Had cast him out from Heaven , with all his host</l>
     <l n="38">Of rebel Angels , by whose aid , aspiring</l>
     <l n="39">To set himself in glory above his peers ,</l>
     <l n="40">He trusted to have equalled the Most High ,</l>
     <l n="41">If he opposed , and with ambitious aim</l>
     <l n="42">Against the throne and monarchy of God ,</l>
     <l n="43">Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud ,</l>
     <l n="44">With vain attempt . Him the Almighty Power</l>
     <l n="45">Hurled headlong flaming from th ’ ethereal sky ,</l>
     <l n="46">With hideous ruin and combustion , down</l>
     <l n="47">To bottomless perdition , there to dwell</l>
     <l n="48">In adamantine chains and penal fire ,</l>
     <l n="49">Who durst defy th ’ Omnipotent to arms .</l>
     <l n="50">Nine times the space that measures day and night</l>
     <l n="51">To mortal men , he , with his horrid crew ,</l>
     <l n="52">Lay vanquished , rolling in the fiery gulf ,</l>
     <l n="53">Confounded , though immortal . But his doom</l>
     <l n="54">Reserved him to more wrath ; for now the thought</l>
     <l n="55">Both of lost happiness and lasting pain</l>
     <l n="56">Torments him : round he throws his baleful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="57">That witnessed huge affliction and dismay ,</l>
     <l n="58">Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate .</l>
     <l n="59">At once , as far as Angels ken , he views</l>
     <l n="60">The dismal situation waste and wild .</l>
     <l n="61">A dungeon horrible , on all sides round ,</l>
     <l n="62">As one great furnace flamed ; yet from those flames</l>
     <l n="63">No light ; but rather darkness visible</l>
     <l n="64">Served only to discover sights of woe ,</l>
     <l n="65">Regions of sorrow , doleful shades , where peace</l>
     <l n="66">And rest can never dwell , hope never comes</l>
     <l n="67">That comes to all , but torture without end</l>
     <l n="68">Still urges , and a fiery deluge , fed</l>
     <l n="69">With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed .</l>
     <l n="70">Such place Eternal Justice has prepared</l>
     <l n="71">For those rebellious ; here their prison ordained</l>
     <l n="72">In utter darkness , and their portion set ,</l>
     <l n="73">As far removed from God and light of Heaven</l>
     <l n="74">As from the centre thrice to th ’ utmost pole .</l>
     <l n="75">Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell !</l>
     <l n="76">There the companions of his fall , o'erwhelmed</l>
     <l n="77">With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire ,</l>
     <l n="78">He soon discerns ; and , weltering by his side ,</l>
     <l n="79">One next himself in power , and next in crime ,</l>
     <l n="80">Long after known in Palestine , and named</l>
     <l n="81">Beelzebub . To whom th ’ Arch-Enemy ,</l>
     <l n="82">And thence in Heaven called Satan , with bold words</l>
     <l n="83">Breaking the horrid silence , thus began :—</l>
     <l n="84">“ If thou beest he — but O how fallen ! how changed</l>
     <l n="85">From him who , in the happy realms of light</l>
     <l n="86">Clothed with transcendent brightness , didst outshine</l>
     <l n="87">Myriads , though bright !— if he whom mutual league ,</l>
     <l n="88">United thoughts and counsels , equal hope</l>
     <l n="89">And hazard in the glorious enterprise</l>
     <l n="90">Joined with me once , now misery hath joined</l>
     <l n="91">In equal ruin ; into what pit thou seest</l>
     <l n="92">From what height fallen : so much the stronger proved</l>
     <l n="93">He with his thunder ; and till then who knew</l>
     <l n="94">The force of those dire arms ? Yet not for those ,</l>
     <l n="95">Nor what the potent Victor in his rage</l>
     <l n="96">Can else inflict , do I repent , or change ,</l>
     <l n="97">Though changed in outward lustre , that fixed mind ,</l>
     <l n="98">And high disdain from sense of injured merit ,</l>
     <l n="99">That with the Mightiest raised me to contend ,</l>
     <l n="100">And to the fierce contentions brought along</l>
     <l n="101">Innumerable force of Spirits armed ,</l>
     <l n="102">That durst dislike his reign , and , me preferring ,</l>
     <l n="103">His utmost power with adverse power opposed</l>
     <l n="104">In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="105">And shook his throne . What though the field be lost ?</l>
     <l n="106">All is not lost — the unconquerable will ,</l>
     <l n="107">And study of revenge , immortal hate ,</l>
     <l n="108">And courage never to submit or yield :</l>
     <l n="109">And what is else not to be overcome ?</l>
     <l n="110">That glory never shall his wrath or might</l>
     <l n="111">Extort from me . To bow and sue for grace</l>
     <l n="112">With suppliant knee , and deify his power</l>
     <l n="113">Who , from the terror of this arm , so late</l>
     <l n="114">Doubted his empire — that were low indeed ;</l>
     <l n="115">That were an ignominy and shame beneath</l>
     <l n="116">This downfall ; since , by fate , the strength of Gods ,</l>
     <l n="117">And this empyreal sybstance , cannot fail ;</l>
     <l n="118">Since , through experience of this great event ,</l>
     <l n="119">In arms not worse , in foresight much advanced ,</l>
     <l n="120">We may with more successful hope resolve</l>
     <l n="121">To wage by force or guile eternal war ,</l>
     <l n="122">Irreconcilable to our grand Foe ,</l>
     <l n="123">Who now triumphs , and in th ’ excess of joy</l>
     <l n="124">Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven . ”</l>
     <l n="125">So spake th ’ apostate Angel , though in pain ,</l>
     <l n="126">Vaunting aloud , but racked with deep despair ;</l>
     <l n="127">And him thus answered soon his bold compeer :—</l>
     <l n="128">“ O Prince , O Chief of many throned Powers</l>
     <l n="129">That led th ’ embattled Seraphim to war</l>
     <l n="130">Under thy conduct , and , in dreadful deeds</l>
     <l n="131">Fearless , endangered Heaven 's perpetual King ,</l>
     <l n="132">And put to proof his high supremacy ,</l>
     <l n="133">Whether upheld by strength , or chance , or fate ,</l>
     <l n="134">Too well I see and rue the dire event</l>
     <l n="135">That , with sad overthrow and foul defeat ,</l>
     <l n="136">Hath lost us Heaven , and all this mighty host</l>
     <l n="137">In horrible destruction laid thus low ,</l>
     <l n="138">As far as Gods and heavenly Essences</l>
     <l n="139">Can perish : for the mind and spirit remains</l>
     <l n="140">Invincible , and vigour soon returns ,</l>
     <l n="141">Though all our glory extinct , and happy state</l>
     <l n="142">Here swallowed up in endless misery .</l>
     <l n="143">But what if he our Conqueror ( whom I now</l>
     <l n="144">Of force believe almighty , since no less</l>
     <l n="145">Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours )</l>
     <l n="146">Have left us this our spirit and strength entire ,</l>
     <l n="147">Strongly to suffer and support our pains ,</l>
     <l n="148">That we may so suffice his vengeful ire ,</l>
     <l n="149">Or do him mightier service as his thralls</l>
     <l n="150">By right of war , whate'er his business be ,</l>
     <l n="151">Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire ,</l>
     <l n="152">Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep ?</l>
     <l n="153">What can it the avail though yet we feel</l>
     <l n="154">Strength undiminished , or eternal being</l>
     <l n="155">To undergo eternal punishment ? ”</l>
     <l n="156">Whereto with speedy words th ’ Arch-Fiend replied :—</l>
     <l n="157">“ Fallen Cherub , to be weak is miserable ,</l>
     <l n="158">Doing or suffering : but of this be sure —</l>
     <l n="159">To do aught good never will be our task ,</l>
     <l n="160">But ever to do ill our sole delight ,</l>
     <l n="161">As being the contrary to his high will</l>
     <l n="162">Whom we resist . If then his providence</l>
     <l n="163">Out of our evil seek to bring forth good ,</l>
     <l n="164">Our labour must be to pervert that end ,</l>
     <l n="165">And out of good still to find means of evil ;</l>
     <l n="166">Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps</l>
     <l n="167">Shall grieve him , if I fail not , and disturb</l>
     <l n="168">His inmost counsels from their destined aim .</l>
     <l n="169">But see ! the angry Victor hath recalled</l>
     <l n="170">His ministers of vengeance and pursuit</l>
     <l n="171">Back to the gates of Heaven : the sulphurous hail ,</l>
     <l n="172">Shot after us in storm , o'erblown hath laid</l>
     <l n="173">The fiery surge that from the precipice</l>
     <l n="174">Of Heaven received us falling ; and the thunder ,</l>
     <l n="175">Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage ,</l>
     <l n="176">Perhaps hath spent his shafts , and ceases now</l>
     <l n="177">To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep .</l>
     <l n="178">Let us not slip th ’ occasion , whether scorn</l>
     <l n="179">Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe .</l>
     <l n="180">Seest thou yon dreary plain , forlorn and wild ,</l>
     <l n="181">The seat of desolation , void of light ,</l>
     <l n="182">Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</l>
     <l n="183">Casts pale and dreadful ? Thither let us tend</l>
     <l n="184">From off the tossing of these fiery waves ;</l>
     <l n="185">There rest , if any rest can harbour there ;</l>
     <l n="186">And , re-assembling our afflicted powers ,</l>
     <l n="187">Consult how we may henceforth most offend</l>
     <l n="188">Our enemy , our own loss how repair ,</l>
     <l n="189">How overcome this dire calamity ,</l>
     <l n="190">What reinforcement we may gain from hope ,</l>
     <l n="191">If not , what resolution from despair . ”</l>
     <l n="192">Thus Satan , talking to his nearest mate ,</l>
     <l n="193">With head uplift above the wave , and eyes</l>
     <l n="194">That sparkling blazed ; his other parts besides</l>
     <l n="195">Prone on the flood , extended long and large ,</l>
     <l n="196">Lay floating many a rood , in bulk as huge</l>
     <l n="197">As whom the fables name of monstrous size ,</l>
     <l n="198">Titanian or Earth-born , that warred on Jove ,</l>
     <l n="199">Briareos or Typhon , whom the den</l>
     <l n="200">By ancient Tarsus held , or that sea-beast</l>
     <l n="201">Leviathan , which God of all his works</l>
     <l n="202">Created hugest that swim th ’ ocean-stream .</l>
     <l n="203">Him , haply slumbering on the Norway foam ,</l>
     <l n="204">The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff ,</l>
     <l n="205">Deeming some island , oft , as seamen tell ,</l>
     <l n="206">With fixed anchor in his scaly rind ,</l>
     <l n="207">Moors by his side under the lee , while night</l>
     <l n="208">Invests the sea , and wished morn delays .</l>
     <l n="209">So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay ,</l>
     <l n="210">Chained on the burning lake ; nor ever thence</l>
     <l n="211">Had risen , or heaved his head , but that the will</l>
     <l n="212">And high permission of all-ruling Heaven</l>
     <l n="213">Left him at large to his own dark designs ,</l>
     <l n="214">That with reiterated crimes he might</l>
     <l n="215">Heap on himself damnation , while he sought</l>
     <l n="216">Evil to others , and enraged might see</l>
     <l n="217">How all his malice served but to bring forth</l>
     <l n="218">Infinite goodness , grace , and mercy , shewn</l>
     <l n="219">On Man by him seduced , but on himself</l>
     <l n="220">Treble confusion , wrath , and vengeance poured .</l>
     <l n="221">Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool</l>
     <l n="222">His mighty stature ; on each hand the flames</l>
     <l n="223">Driven backward slope their pointing spires , and rolled</l>
     <l n="224">In billows , leave i ’ th ’ midst a horrid vale .</l>
     <l n="225">Then with expanded wings he steers his flight</l>
     <l n="226">Aloft , incumbent on the dusky air ,</l>
     <l n="227">That felt unusual weight ; till on dry land</l>
     <l n="228">He lights — if it were land that ever burned</l>
     <l n="229">With solid , as the lake with liquid fire ,</l>
     <l n="230">And such appeared in hue as when the force</l>
     <l n="231">Of subterranean wind transports a hill</l>
     <l n="232">Torn from Pelorus , or the shattered side</l>
     <l n="233">Of thundering Etna , whose combustible</l>
     <l n="234">And fuelled entrails , thence conceiving fire ,</l>
     <l n="235">Sublimed with mineral fury , aid the winds ,</l>
     <l n="236">And leave a singed bottom all involved</l>
     <l n="237">With stench and smoke . Such resting found the sole</l>
     <l n="238">Of unblest feet . Him followed his next mate ;</l>
     <l n="239">Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood</l>
     <l n="240">As gods , and by their own recovered strength ,</l>
     <l n="241">Not by the sufferance of supernal Power .</l>
     <l n="242">“ Is this the region , this the soil , the clime , ”</l>
     <l n="243">Said then the lost Archangel , “ this the seat</l>
     <l n="244">That we must change for Heaven ?— this mournful gloom</l>
     <l n="245">For that celestial light ? Be it so , since he</l>
     <l n="246">Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid</l>
     <l n="247">What shall be right : farthest from him is best</l>
     <l n="248">Whom reason hath equalled , force hath made supreme</l>
     <l n="249">Above his equals . Farewell , happy fields ,</l>
     <l n="250">Where joy for ever dwells ! Hail , horrors ! hail ,</l>
     <l n="251">Infernal world ! and thou , profoundest Hell ,</l>
     <l n="252">Receive thy new possessor — one who brings</l>
     <l n="253">A mind not to be changed by place or time .</l>
     <l n="254">The mind is its own place , and in itself</l>
     <l n="255">Can make a Heaven of Hell , a Hell of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="256">What matter where , if I be still the same ,</l>
     <l n="257">And what I should be , all but less than he</l>
     <l n="258">Whom thunder hath made greater ? Here at least</l>
     <l n="259">We shall be free ; th ’ Almighty hath not built</l>
     <l n="260">Here for his envy , will not drive us hence :</l>
     <l n="261">Here we may reign secure ; and , in my choice ,</l>
     <l n="262">To reign is worth ambition , though in Hell :</l>
     <l n="263">Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven .</l>
     <l n="264">But wherefore let we then our faithful friends ,</l>
     <l n="265">Th ’ associates and co-partners of our loss ,</l>
     <l n="266">Lie thus astonished on th ’ oblivious pool ,</l>
     <l n="267">And call them not to share with us their part</l>
     <l n="268">In this unhappy mansion , or once more</l>
     <l n="269">With rallied arms to try what may be yet</l>
     <l n="270">Regained in Heaven , or what more lost in Hell ? ”</l>
     <l n="271">So Satan spake ; and him Beelzebub</l>
     <l n="272">Thus answered :— “ Leader of those armies bright</l>
     <l n="273">Which , but th ’ Omnipotent , none could have foiled !</l>
     <l n="274">If once they hear that voice , their liveliest pledge</l>
     <l n="275">Of hope in fears and dangers — heard so oft</l>
     <l n="276">In worst extremes , and on the perilous edge</l>
     <l n="277">Of battle , when it raged , in all assaults</l>
     <l n="278">Their surest signal — they will soon resume</l>
     <l n="279">New courage and revive , though now they lie</l>
     <l n="280">Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire ,</l>
     <l n="281">As we erewhile , astounded and amazed ;</l>
     <l n="282">No wonder , fallen such a pernicious height ! ”</l>
     <l n="283">He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend</l>
     <l n="284">Was moving toward the shore ; his ponderous shield ,</l>
     <l n="285">Ethereal temper , massy , large , and round ,</l>
     <l n="286">Behind him cast . The broad circumference</l>
     <l n="287">Hung on his shoulders like the moon , whose orb</l>
     <l n="288">Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views</l>
     <l n="289">At evening , from the top of Fesole ,</l>
     <l n="290">Or in Valdarno , to descry new lands ,</l>
     <l n="291">Rivers , or mountains , in her spotty globe .</l>
     <l n="292">His spear — to equal which the tallest pine</l>
     <l n="293">Hewn on Norwegian hills , to be the mast</l>
     <l n="294">Of some great ammiral , were but a wand —</l>
     <l n="295">He walked with , to support uneasy steps</l>
     <l n="296">Over the burning marl , not like those steps</l>
     <l n="297">On Heaven 's azure ; and the torrid clime</l>
     <l n="298">Smote on him sore besides , vaulted with fire .</l>
     <l n="299">Nathless he so endured , till on the beach</l>
     <l n="300">Of that inflamed sea he stood , and called</l>
     <l n="301">His legions — Angel Forms , who lay entranced</l>
     <l n="302">Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks</l>
     <l n="303">In Vallombrosa , where th ’ Etrurian shades</l>
     <l n="304">High over-arched embower ; or scattered sedge</l>
     <l n="305">Afloat , when with fierce winds Orion armed</l>
     <l n="306">Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast , whose waves o'erthrew</l>
     <l n="307">Busiris and his Memphian chivalry ,</l>
     <l n="308">While with perfidious hatred they pursued</l>
     <l n="309">The sojourners of Goshen , who beheld</l>
     <l n="310">From the safe shore their floating carcases</l>
     <l n="311">And broken chariot-wheels . So thick bestrown ,</l>
     <l n="312">Abject and lost , lay these , covering the flood ,</l>
     <l n="313">Under amazement of their hideous change .</l>
     <l n="314">He called so loud that all the hollow deep</l>
     <l n="315">Of Hell resounded :— “ Princes , Potentates ,</l>
     <l n="316">Warriors , the Flower of Heaven — once yours ; now lost ,</l>
     <l n="317">If such astonishment as this can seize</l>
     <l n="318">Eternal Spirits ! Or have ye chosen this place</l>
     <l n="319">After the toil of battle to repose</l>
     <l n="320">Your wearied virtue , for the ease you find</l>
     <l n="321">To slumber here , as in the vales of Heaven ?</l>
     <l n="322">Or in this abject posture have ye sworn</l>
     <l n="323">To adore the Conqueror , who now beholds</l>
     <l n="324">Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood</l>
     <l n="325">With scattered arms and ensigns , till anon</l>
     <l n="326">His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern</l>
     <l n="327">Th ’ advantage , and , descending , tread us down</l>
     <l n="328">Thus drooping , or with linked thunderbolts</l>
     <l n="329">Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf ?</l>
     <l n="330">Awake , arise , or be for ever fallen ! ”</l>
     <l n="331">They heard , and were abashed , and up they sprung</l>
     <l n="332">Upon the wing , as when men wont to watch</l>
     <l n="333">On duty , sleeping found by whom they dread ,</l>
     <l n="334">Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake .</l>
     <l n="335">Nor did they not perceive the evil plight</l>
     <l n="336">In which they were , or the fierce pains not feel ;</l>
     <l n="337">Yet to their General 's voice they soon obeyed</l>
     <l n="338">Innumerable . As when the potent rod</l>
     <l n="339">Of Amram 's son , in Egypt 's evil day ,</l>
     <l n="340">Waved round the coast , up-called a pitchy cloud</l>
     <l n="341">Of locusts , warping on the eastern wind ,</l>
     <l n="342">That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung</l>
     <l n="343">Like Night , and darkened all the land of Nile ;</l>
     <l n="344">So numberless were those bad Angels seen</l>
     <l n="345">Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell ,</l>
     <l n="346">‘ Twixt upper , nether , and surrounding fires ;</l>
     <l n="347">Till , as a signal given , th ’ uplifted spear</l>
     <l n="348">Of their great Sultan waving to direct</l>
     <l n="349">Their course , in even balance down they light</l>
     <l n="350">On the firm brimstone , and fill all the plain :</l>
     <l n="351">A multitude like which the populous North</l>
     <l n="352">Poured never from her frozen loins to pass</l>
     <l n="353">Rhene or the Danaw , when her barbarous sons</l>
     <l n="354">Came like a deluge on the South , and spread</l>
     <l n="355">Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands .</l>
     <l n="356">Forthwith , form every squadron and each band ,</l>
     <l n="357">The heads and leaders thither haste where stood</l>
     <l n="358">Their great Commander — godlike Shapes , and Forms</l>
     <l n="359">Excelling human ; princely Dignities ;</l>
     <l n="360">And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones ,</l>
     <l n="361">Though on their names in Heavenly records now</l>
     <l n="362">Be no memorial , blotted out and rased</l>
     <l n="363">By their rebellion from the Books of Life .</l>
     <l n="364">Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve</l>
     <l n="365">Got them new names , till , wandering o'er the earth ,</l>
     <l n="366">Through God 's high sufferance for the trial of man ,</l>
     <l n="367">By falsities and lies the greatest part</l>
     <l n="368">Of mankind they corrupted to forsake</l>
     <l n="369">God their Creator , and th ’ invisible</l>
     <l n="370">Glory of him that made them to transform</l>
     <l n="371">Oft to the image of a brute , adorned</l>
     <l n="372">With gay religions full of pomp and gold ,</l>
     <l n="373">And devils to adore for deities :</l>
     <l n="374">Then were they known to men by various names ,</l>
     <l n="375">And various idols through the heathen world .</l>
     <l n="376">Say , Muse , their names then known , who first , who last ,</l>
     <l n="377">Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch ,</l>
     <l n="378">At their great Emperor 's call , as next in worth</l>
     <l n="379">Came singly where he stood on the bare strand ,</l>
     <l n="380">While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof ?</l>
     <l n="381">The chief were those who , from the pit of Hell</l>
     <l n="382">Roaming to seek their prey on Earth , durst fix</l>
     <l n="383">Their seats , long after , next the seat of God ,</l>
     <l n="384">Their altars by his altar , gods adored</l>
     <l n="385">Among the nations round , and durst abide</l>
     <l n="386">Jehovah thundering out of Sion , throned</l>
     <l n="387">Between the Cherubim ; yea , often placed</l>
     <l n="388">Within his sanctuary itself their shrines ,</l>
     <l n="389">Abominations ; and with cursed things</l>
     <l n="390">His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned ,</l>
     <l n="391">And with their darkness durst affront his light .</l>
     <l n="392">First , Moloch , horrid king , besmeared with blood</l>
     <l n="393">Of human sacrifice , and parents ’ tears ;</l>
     <l n="394">Though , for the noise of drums and timbrels loud ,</l>
     <l n="395">Their children 's cries unheard that passed through fire</l>
     <l n="396">To his grim idol . Him the Ammonite</l>
     <l n="397">Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain ,</l>
     <l n="398">In Argob and in Basan , to the stream</l>
     <l n="399">Of utmost Arnon . Nor content with such</l>
     <l n="400">Audacious neighbourhood , the wisest heart</l>
     <l n="401">Of Solomon he led by fraud to build</l>
     <l n="402">His temple right against the temple of God</l>
     <l n="403">On that opprobrious hill , and made his grove</l>
     <l n="404">The pleasant valley of Hinnom , Tophet thence</l>
     <l n="405">And black Gehenna called , the type of Hell .</l>
     <l n="406">Next Chemos , th ’ obscene dread of Moab 's sons ,</l>
     <l n="407">From Aroar to Nebo and the wild</l>
     <l n="408">Of southmost Abarim ; in Hesebon</l>
     <l n="409">And Horonaim , Seon 's real , beyond</l>
     <l n="410">The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines ,</l>
     <l n="411">And Eleale to th ’ Asphaltic Pool :</l>
     <l n="412">Peor his other name , when he enticed</l>
     <l n="413">Israel in Sittim , on their march from Nile ,</l>
     <l n="414">To do him wanton rites , which cost them woe .</l>
     <l n="415">Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged</l>
     <l n="416">Even to that hill of scandal , by the grove</l>
     <l n="417">Of Moloch homicide , lust hard by hate ,</l>
     <l n="418">Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell .</l>
     <l n="419">With these came they who , from the bordering flood</l>
     <l n="420">Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts</l>
     <l n="421">Egypt from Syrian ground , had general names</l>
     <l n="422">Of Baalim and Ashtaroth — those male ,</l>
     <l n="423">These feminine . For Spirits , when they please ,</l>
     <l n="424">Can either sex assume , or both ; so soft</l>
     <l n="425">And uncompounded is their essence pure ,</l>
     <l n="426">Not tried or manacled with joint or limb ,</l>
     <l n="427">Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones ,</l>
     <l n="428">Like cumbrous flesh ; but , in what shape they choose ,</l>
     <l n="429">Dilated or condensed , bright or obscure ,</l>
     <l n="430">Can execute their airy purposes ,</l>
     <l n="431">And works of love or enmity fulfil .</l>
     <l n="432">For those the race of Israel oft forsook</l>
     <l n="433">Their Living Strength , and unfrequented left</l>
     <l n="434">His righteous altar , bowing lowly down</l>
     <l n="435">To bestial gods ; for which their heads as low</l>
     <l n="436">Bowed down in battle , sunk before the spear</l>
     <l n="437">Of despicable foes . With these in troop</l>
     <l n="438">Came Astoreth , whom the Phoenicians called</l>
     <l n="439">Astarte , queen of heaven , with crescent horns ;</l>
     <l n="440">To whose bright image nightly by the moon</l>
     <l n="441">Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs ;</l>
     <l n="442">In Sion also not unsung , where stood</l>
     <l n="443">Her temple on th ’ offensive mountain , built</l>
     <l n="444">By that uxorious king whose heart , though large ,</l>
     <l n="445">Beguiled by fair idolatresses , fell</l>
     <l n="446">To idols foul . Thammuz came next behind ,</l>
     <l n="447">Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured</l>
     <l n="448">The Syrian damsels to lament his fate</l>
     <l n="449">In amorous ditties all a summer 's day ,</l>
     <l n="450">While smooth Adonis from his native rock</l>
     <l n="451">Ran purple to the sea , supposed with blood</l>
     <l n="452">Of Thammuz yearly wounded : the love-tale</l>
     <l n="453">Infected Sion 's daughters with like heat ,</l>
     <l n="454">Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch</l>
     <l n="455">Ezekiel saw , when , by the vision led ,</l>
     <l n="456">His eye surveyed the dark idolatries</l>
     <l n="457">Of alienated Judah . Next came one</l>
     <l n="458">Who mourned in earnest , when the captive ark</l>
     <l n="459">Maimed his brute image , head and hands lopt off ,</l>
     <l n="460">In his own temple , on the grunsel-edge ,</l>
     <l n="461">Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers :</l>
     <l n="462">Dagon his name , sea-monster , upward man</l>
     <l n="463">And downward fish ; yet had his temple high</l>
     <l n="464">Reared in Azotus , dreaded through the coast</l>
     <l n="465">Of Palestine , in Gath and Ascalon ,</l>
     <l n="466">And Accaron and Gaza 's frontier bounds .</l>
     <l n="467">Him followed Rimmon , whose delightful seat</l>
     <l n="468">Was fair Damascus , on the fertile banks</l>
     <l n="469">Of Abbana and Pharphar , lucid streams .</l>
     <l n="470">He also against the house of God was bold :</l>
     <l n="471">A leper once he lost , and gained a king —</l>
     <l n="472">Ahaz , his sottish conqueror , whom he drew</l>
     <l n="473">God 's altar to disparage and displace</l>
     <l n="474">For one of Syrian mode , whereon to burn</l>
     <l n="475">His odious offerings , and adore the gods</l>
     <l n="476">Whom he had vanquished . After these appeared</l>
     <l n="477">A crew who , under names of old renown —</l>
     <l n="478">Osiris , Isis , Orus , and their train —</l>
     <l n="479">With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused</l>
     <l n="480">Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek</l>
     <l n="481">Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms</l>
     <l n="482">Rather than human . Nor did Israel scape</l>
     <l n="483">Th ’ infection , when their borrowed gold composed</l>
     <l n="484">The calf in Oreb ; and the rebel king</l>
     <l n="485">Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan ,</l>
     <l n="486">Likening his Maker to the grazed ox —</l>
     <l n="487">Jehovah , who , in one night , when he passed</l>
     <l n="488">From Egypt marching , equalled with one stroke</l>
     <l n="489">Both her first-born and all her bleating gods .</l>
     <l n="490">Belial came last ; than whom a Spirit more lewd</l>
     <l n="491">Fell not from Heaven , or more gross to love</l>
     <l n="492">Vice for itself . To him no temple stood</l>
     <l n="493">Or altar smoked ; yet who more oft than he</l>
     <l n="494">In temples and at altars , when the priest</l>
     <l n="495">Turns atheist , as did Eli 's sons , who filled</l>
     <l n="496">With lust and violence the house of God ?</l>
     <l n="497">In courts and palaces he also reigns ,</l>
     <l n="498">And in luxurious cities , where the noise</l>
     <l n="499">Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers ,</l>
     <l n="500">And injury and outrage ; and , when night</l>
     <l n="501">Darkens the streets , then wander forth the sons</l>
     <l n="502">Of Belial , flown with insolence and wine .</l>
     <l n="503">Witness the streets of Sodom , and that night</l>
     <l n="504">In Gibeah , when the hospitable door</l>
     <l n="505">Exposed a matron , to avoid worse rape .</l>
     <l n="506">These were the prime in order and in might :</l>
     <l n="507">The rest were long to tell ; though far renowned</l>
     <l n="508">Th ’ Ionian gods — of Javan 's issue held</l>
     <l n="509">Gods , yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth ,</l>
     <l n="510">Their boasted parents ;— Titan , Heaven 's first-born ,</l>
     <l n="511">With his enormous brood , and birthright seized</l>
     <l n="512">By younger Saturn : he from mightier Jove ,</l>
     <l n="513">His own and Rhea 's son , like measure found ;</l>
     <l n="514">So Jove usurping reigned . These , first in Crete</l>
     <l n="515">And Ida known , thence on the snowy top</l>
     <l n="516">Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air ,</l>
     <l n="517">Their highest heaven ; or on the Delphian cliff ,</l>
     <l n="518">Or in Dodona , and through all the bounds</l>
     <l n="519">Of Doric land ; or who with Saturn old</l>
     <l n="520">Fled over Adria to th ’ Hesperian fields ,</l>
     <l n="521">And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles .</l>
     <l n="522">All these and more came flocking ; but with looks</l>
     <l n="523">Downcast and damp ; yet such wherein appeared</l>
     <l n="524">Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief</l>
     <l n="525">Not in despair , to have found themselves not lost</l>
     <l n="526">In loss itself ; which on his countenance cast</l>
     <l n="527">Like doubtful hue . But he , his wonted pride</l>
     <l n="528">Soon recollecting , with high words , that bore</l>
     <l n="529">Semblance of worth , not substance , gently raised</l>
     <l n="530">Their fainting courage , and dispelled their fears .</l>
     <l n="531">Then straight commands that , at the warlike sound</l>
     <l n="532">Of trumpets loud and clarions , be upreared</l>
     <l n="533">His mighty standard . That proud honour claimed</l>
     <l n="534">Azazel as his right , a Cherub tall :</l>
     <l n="535">Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled</l>
     <l n="536">Th ’ imperial ensign ; which , full high advanced ,</l>
     <l n="537">Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind ,</l>
     <l n="538">With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed ,</l>
     <l n="539">Seraphic arms and trophies ; all the while</l>
     <l n="540">Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds :</l>
     <l n="541">At which the universal host up-sent</l>
     <l n="542">A shout that tore Hell 's concave , and beyond</l>
     <l n="543">Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night .</l>
     <l n="544">All in a moment through the gloom were seen</l>
     <l n="545">Ten thousand banners rise into the air ,</l>
     <l n="546">With orient colours waving : with them rose</l>
     <l n="547">A forest huge of spears ; and thronging helms</l>
     <l n="548">Appeared , and serried shields in thick array</l>
     <l n="549">Of depth immeasurable . Anon they move</l>
     <l n="550">In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood</l>
     <l n="551">Of flutes and soft recorders — such as raised</l>
     <l n="552">To height of noblest temper heroes old</l>
     <l n="553">Arming to battle , and instead of rage</l>
     <l n="554">Deliberate valour breathed , firm , and unmoved</l>
     <l n="555">With dread of death to flight or foul retreat ;</l>
     <l n="556">Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage</l>
     <l n="557">With solemn touches troubled thoughts , and chase</l>
     <l n="558">Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain</l>
     <l n="559">From mortal or immortal minds . Thus they ,</l>
     <l n="560">Breathing united force with fixed thought ,</l>
     <l n="561">Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed</l>
     <l n="562">Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil . And now</l>
     <l n="563">Advanced in view they stand — a horrid front</l>
     <l n="564">Of dreadful length and dazzling arms , in guise</l>
     <l n="565">Of warriors old , with ordered spear and shield ,</l>
     <l n="566">Awaiting what command their mighty Chief</l>
     <l n="567">Had to impose . He through the armed files</l>
     <l n="568">Darts his experienced eye , and soon traverse</l>
     <l n="569">The whole battalion views — their order due ,</l>
     <l n="570">Their visages and stature as of gods ;</l>
     <l n="571">Their number last he sums . And now his heart</l>
     <l n="572">Distends with pride , and , hardening in his strength ,</l>
     <l n="573">Glories : for never , since created Man ,</l>
     <l n="574">Met such embodied force as , named with these ,</l>
     <l n="575">Could merit more than that small infantry</l>
     <l n="576">Warred on by cranes — though all the giant brood</l>
     <l n="577">Of Phlegra with th ’ heroic race were joined</l>
     <l n="578">That fought at Thebes and Ilium , on each side</l>
     <l n="579">Mixed with auxiliar gods ; and what resounds</l>
     <l n="580">In fable or romance of Uther 's son ,</l>
     <l n="581">Begirt with British and Armoric knights ;</l>
     <l n="582">And all who since , baptized or infidel ,</l>
     <l n="583">Jousted in Aspramont , or Montalban ,</l>
     <l n="584">Damasco , or Marocco , or Trebisond ,</l>
     <l n="585">Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore</l>
     <l n="586">When Charlemain with all his peerage fell</l>
     <l n="587">By Fontarabbia . Thus far these beyond</l>
     <l n="588">Compare of mortal prowess , yet observed</l>
     <l n="589">Their dread Commander . He , above the rest</l>
     <l n="590">In shape and gesture proudly eminent ,</l>
     <l n="591">Stood like a tower . His form had yet not lost</l>
     <l n="592">All her original brightness , nor appeared</l>
     <l n="593">Less than Archangel ruined , and th ’ excess</l>
     <l n="594">Of glory obscured : as when the sun new-risen</l>
     <l n="595">Looks through the horizontal misty air</l>
     <l n="596">Shorn of his beams , or , from behind the moon ,</l>
     <l n="597">In dim eclipse , disastrous twilight sheds</l>
     <l n="598">On half the nations , and with fear of change</l>
     <l n="599">Perplexes monarchs . Darkened so , yet shone</l>
     <l n="600">Above them all th ’ Archangel : but his face</l>
     <l n="601">Deep scars of thunder had intrenched , and care</l>
     <l n="602">Sat on his faded cheek , but under brows</l>
     <l n="603">Of dauntless courage , and considerate pride</l>
     <l n="604">Waiting revenge . Cruel his eye , but cast</l>
     <l n="605">Signs of remorse and passion , to behold</l>
     <l n="606">The fellows of his crime , the followers rather</l>
     <l n="607">( Far other once beheld in bliss ) , condemned</l>
     <l n="608">For ever now to have their lot in pain —</l>
     <l n="609">Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced</l>
     <l n="610">Of Heaven , and from eternal splendours flung</l>
     <l n="611">For his revolt — yet faithful how they stood ,</l>
     <l n="612">Their glory withered ; as , when heaven 's fire</l>
     <l n="613">Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines ,</l>
     <l n="614">With singed top their stately growth , though bare ,</l>
     <l n="615">Stands on the blasted heath . He now prepared</l>
     <l n="616">To speak ; whereat their doubled ranks they bend</l>
     <l n="617">From wing to wing , and half enclose him round</l>
     <l n="618">With all his peers : attention held them mute .</l>
     <l n="619">Thrice he assayed , and thrice , in spite of scorn ,</l>
     <l n="620">Tears , such as Angels weep , burst forth : at last</l>
     <l n="621">Words interwove with sighs found out their way :—</l>
     <l n="622">“ O myriads of immortal Spirits ! O Powers</l>
     <l n="623">Matchless , but with th ’ Almighty !— and that strife</l>
     <l n="624">Was not inglorious , though th ’ event was dire ,</l>
     <l n="625">As this place testifies , and this dire change ,</l>
     <l n="626">Hateful to utter . But what power of mind ,</l>
     <l n="627">Forseeing or presaging , from the depth</l>
     <l n="628">Of knowledge past or present , could have feared</l>
     <l n="629">How such united force of gods , how such</l>
     <l n="630">As stood like these , could ever know repulse ?</l>
     <l n="631">For who can yet believe , though after loss ,</l>
     <l n="632">That all these puissant legions , whose exile</l>
     <l n="633">Hath emptied Heaven , shall fail to re-ascend ,</l>
     <l n="634">Self-raised , and repossess their native seat ?</l>
     <l n="635">For me , be witness all the host of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="636">If counsels different , or danger shunned</l>
     <l n="637">By me , have lost our hopes . But he who reigns</l>
     <l n="638">Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure</l>
     <l n="639">Sat on his throne , upheld by old repute ,</l>
     <l n="640">Consent or custom , and his regal state</l>
     <l n="641">Put forth at full , but still his strength concealed —</l>
     <l n="642">Which tempted our attempt , and wrought our fall .</l>
     <l n="643">Henceforth his might we know , and know our own ,</l>
     <l n="644">So as not either to provoke , or dread</l>
     <l n="645">New war provoked : our better part remains</l>
     <l n="646">To work in close design , by fraud or guile ,</l>
     <l n="647">What force effected not ; that he no less</l>
     <l n="648">At length from us may find , who overcomes</l>
     <l n="649">By force hath overcome but half his foe .</l>
     <l n="650">Space may produce new Worlds ; whereof so rife</l>
     <l n="651">There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long</l>
     <l n="652">Intended to create , and therein plant</l>
     <l n="653">A generation whom his choice regard</l>
     <l n="654">Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="655">Thither , if but to pry , shall be perhaps</l>
     <l n="656">Our first eruption — thither , or elsewhere ;</l>
     <l n="657">For this infernal pit shall never hold</l>
     <l n="658">Celestial Spirits in bondage , nor th ’ Abyss</l>
     <l n="659">Long under darkness cover . But these thoughts</l>
     <l n="660">Full counsel must mature . Peace is despaired ;</l>
     <l n="661">For who can think submission ? War , then , war</l>
     <l n="662">Open or understood , must be resolved . ”</l>
     <l n="663">He spake ; and , to confirm his words , outflew</l>
     <l n="664">Millions of flaming swords , drawn from the thighs</l>
     <l n="665">Of mighty Cherubim ; the sudden blaze</l>
     <l n="666">Far round illumined Hell . Highly they raged</l>
     <l n="667">Against the Highest , and fierce with grasped arms</l>
     <l n="668">Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war ,</l>
     <l n="669">Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="670">There stood a hill not far , whose grisly top</l>
     <l n="671">Belched fire and rolling smoke ; the rest entire</l>
     <l n="672">Shone with a glossy scurf — undoubted sign</l>
     <l n="673">That in his womb was hid metallic ore ,</l>
     <l n="674">The work of sulphur . Thither , winged with speed ,</l>
     <l n="675">A numerous brigade hastened : as when bands</l>
     <l n="676">Of pioneers , with spade and pickaxe armed ,</l>
     <l n="677">Forerun the royal camp , to trench a field ,</l>
     <l n="678">Or cast a rampart . Mammon led them on —</l>
     <l n="679">Mammon , the least erected Spirit that fell</l>
     <l n="680">From Heaven ; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts</l>
     <l n="681">Were always downward bent , admiring more</l>
     <l n="682">The riches of heaven 's pavement , trodden gold ,</l>
     <l n="683">Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed</l>
     <l n="684">In vision beatific . By him first</l>
     <l n="685">Men also , and by his suggestion taught ,</l>
     <l n="686">Ransacked the centre , and with impious hands</l>
     <l n="687">Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth</l>
     <l n="688">For treasures better hid . Soon had his crew</l>
     <l n="689">Opened into the hill a spacious wound ,</l>
     <l n="690">And digged out ribs of gold . Let none admire</l>
     <l n="691">That riches grow in Hell ; that soil may best</l>
     <l n="692">Deserve the precious bane . And here let those</l>
     <l n="693">Who boast in mortal things , and wondering tell</l>
     <l n="694">Of Babel , and the works of Memphian kings ,</l>
     <l n="695">Learn how their greatest monuments of fame</l>
     <l n="696">And strength , and art , are easily outdone</l>
     <l n="697">By Spirits reprobate , and in an hour</l>
     <l n="698">What in an age they , with incessant toil</l>
     <l n="699">And hands innumerable , scarce perform .</l>
     <l n="700">Nigh on the plain , in many cells prepared ,</l>
     <l n="701">That underneath had veins of liquid fire</l>
     <l n="702">Sluiced from the lake , a second multitude</l>
     <l n="703">With wondrous art founded the massy ore ,</l>
     <l n="704">Severing each kind , and scummed the bullion-dross .</l>
     <l n="705">A third as soon had formed within the ground</l>
     <l n="706">A various mould , and from the boiling cells</l>
     <l n="707">By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook ;</l>
     <l n="708">As in an organ , from one blast of wind ,</l>
     <l n="709">To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes .</l>
     <l n="710">Anon out of the earth a fabric huge</l>
     <l n="711">Rose like an exhalation , with the sound</l>
     <l n="712">Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet —</l>
     <l n="713">Built like a temple , where pilasters round</l>
     <l n="714">Were set , and Doric pillars overlaid</l>
     <l n="715">With golden architrave ; nor did there want</l>
     <l n="716">Cornice or frieze , with bossy sculptures graven ;</l>
     <l n="717">The roof was fretted gold . Not Babylon</l>
     <l n="718">Nor great Alcairo such magnificence</l>
     <l n="719">Equalled in all their glories , to enshrine</l>
     <l n="720">Belus or Serapis their gods , or seat</l>
     <l n="721">Their kings , when Egypt with Assyria strove</l>
     <l n="722">In wealth and luxury . Th ’ ascending pile</l>
     <l n="723">Stood fixed her stately height , and straight the doors ,</l>
     <l n="724">Opening their brazen folds , discover , wide</l>
     <l n="725">Within , her ample spaces o'er the smooth</l>
     <l n="726">And level pavement : from the arched roof ,</l>
     <l n="727">Pendent by subtle magic , many a row</l>
     <l n="728">Of starry lamps and blazing cressets , fed</l>
     <l n="729">With naptha and asphaltus , yielded light</l>
     <l n="730">As from a sky . The hasty multitude</l>
     <l n="731">Admiring entered ; and the work some praise ,</l>
     <l n="732">And some the architect . His hand was known</l>
     <l n="733">In Heaven by many a towered structure high ,</l>
     <l n="734">Where sceptred Angels held their residence ,</l>
     <l n="735">And sat as Princes , whom the supreme King</l>
     <l n="736">Exalted to such power , and gave to rule ,</l>
     <l n="737">Each in his Hierarchy , the Orders bright .</l>
     <l n="738">Nor was his name unheard or unadored</l>
     <l n="739">In ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land</l>
     <l n="740">Men called him Mulciber ; and how he fell</l>
     <l n="741">From Heaven they fabled , thrown by angry Jove</l>
     <l n="742">Sheer o'er the crystal battlements : from morn</l>
     <l n="743">To noon he fell , from noon to dewy eve ,</l>
     <l n="744">A summer 's day , and with the setting sun</l>
     <l n="745">Dropt from the zenith , like a falling star ,</l>
     <l n="746">On Lemnos , th ’ Aegaean isle . Thus they relate ,</l>
     <l n="747">Erring ; for he with this rebellious rout</l>
     <l n="748">Fell long before ; nor aught availed him now</l>
     <l n="749">To have built in Heaven high towers ; nor did he scape</l>
     <l n="750">By all his engines , but was headlong sent ,</l>
     <l n="751">With his industrious crew , to build in Hell .</l>
     <l n="752">Meanwhile the winged Heralds , by command</l>
     <l n="753">Of sovereign power , with awful ceremony</l>
     <l n="754">And trumpet 's sound , throughout the host proclaim</l>
     <l n="755">A solemn council forthwith to be held</l>
     <l n="756">At Pandemonium , the high capital</l>
     <l n="757">Of Satan and his peers . Their summons called</l>
     <l n="758">From every band and squared regiment</l>
     <l n="759">By place or choice the worthiest : they anon</l>
     <l n="760">With hundreds and with thousands trooping came</l>
     <l n="761">Attended . All access was thronged ; the gates</l>
     <l n="762">And porches wide , but chief the spacious hall</l>
     <l n="763">( Though like a covered field , where champions bold</l>
     <l n="764">Wont ride in armed , and at the Soldan 's chair</l>
     <l n="765">Defied the best of Paynim chivalry</l>
     <l n="766">To mortal combat , or career with lance ) ,</l>
     <l n="767">Thick swarmed , both on the ground and in the air ,</l>
     <l n="768">Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings . As bees</l>
     <l n="769">In spring-time , when the Sun with Taurus rides .</l>
     <l n="770">Pour forth their populous youth about the hive</l>
     <l n="771">In clusters ; they among fresh dews and flowers</l>
     <l n="772">Fly to and fro , or on the smoothed plank ,</l>
     <l n="773">The suburb of their straw-built citadel ,</l>
     <l n="774">New rubbed with balm , expatiate , and confer</l>
     <l n="775">Their state-affairs : so thick the airy crowd</l>
     <l n="776">Swarmed and were straitened ; till , the signal given ,</l>
     <l n="777">Behold a wonder ! They but now who seemed</l>
     <l n="778">In bigness to surpass Earth 's giant sons ,</l>
     <l n="779">Now less than smallest dwarfs , in narrow room</l>
     <l n="780">Throng numberless — like that pygmean race</l>
     <l n="781">Beyond the Indian mount ; or faery elves ,</l>
     <l n="782">Whose midnight revels , by a forest-side</l>
     <l n="783">Or fountain , some belated peasant sees ,</l>
     <l n="784">Or dreams he sees , while overhead the Moon</l>
     <l n="785">Sits arbitress , and nearer to the Earth</l>
     <l n="786">Wheels her pale course : they , on their mirth and dance</l>
     <l n="787">Intent , with jocund music charm his ear ;</l>
     <l n="788">At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds .</l>
     <l n="789">Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms</l>
     <l n="790">Reduced their shapes immense , and were at large ,</l>
     <l n="791">Though without number still , amidst the hall</l>
     <l n="792">Of that infernal court . But far within ,</l>
     <l n="793">And in their own dimensions like themselves ,</l>
     <l n="794">The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim</l>
     <l n="795">In close recess and secret conclave sat ,</l>
     <l n="796">A thousand demi-gods on golden seats ,</l>
     <l n="797">Frequent and full . After short silence then ,</l>
     <l n="798">And summons read , the great consult began .</l>

     <l n="802">Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand</l>
     <l n="803">Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold ,</l>
     <l n="804">Satan exalted sat , by merit raised</l>
     <l n="805">To that bad eminence ; and , from despair</l>

     <l n="807">Beyond thus high , insatiate to pursue</l>
     <l n="808">Vain war with Heaven ; and , by success untaught ,</l>
     <l n="809">His proud imaginations thus displayed :—</l>

     <l n="813">I give not Heaven for lost : from this descent</l>

     <l n="817">Me though just right , and the fixed laws of Heaven ,</l>

     <l n="819">With what besides in council or in fight</l>

     <l n="821">Thus far at least recovered , hath much more</l>
     <l n="822">Established in a safe , unenvied throne ,</l>
     <l n="823">Yielded with full consent . The happier state</l>
     <l n="824">In Heaven , which follows dignity , might draw</l>
     <l n="825">Envy from each inferior ; but who here</l>
     <l n="826">Will envy whom the highest place exposes</l>
     <l n="827">Foremost to stand against the Thunderer 's aim</l>
     <l n="828">Your bulwark , and condemns to greatest share</l>
     <l n="829">Of endless pain ? Where there is , then , no good</l>
     <l n="830">For which to strive , no strife can grow up there</l>
     <l n="831">From faction : for none sure will claim in Hell</l>
     <l n="832">Precedence ; none whose portion is so small</l>
     <l n="833">Of present pain that with ambitious mind</l>

     <l n="842">He ceased ; and next him Moloch , sceptred king ,</l>

     <l n="844">That fought in Heaven , now fiercer by despair .</l>
     <l n="845">His trust was with th ’ Eternal to be deemed</l>
     <l n="846">Equal in strength , and rather than be less</l>
     <l n="847">Cared not to be at all ; with that care lost</l>
     <l n="848">Went all his fear : of God , or Hell , or worse ,</l>
     <l n="849">He recked not , and these words thereafter spake :—</l>

     <l n="859">By our delay ? No ! let us rather choose ,</l>
     <l n="860">Armed with Hell-flames and fury , all at once</l>
     <l n="861">O'er Heaven 's high towers to force resistless way ,</l>

     <l n="864">Of his almighty engine , he shall hear</l>
     <l n="865">Infernal thunder , and , for lightning , see</l>
     <l n="866">Black fire and horror shot with equal rage</l>

     <l n="870">The way seems difficult , and steep to scale</l>
     <l n="871">With upright wing against a higher foe !</l>
     <l n="872">Let such bethink them , if the sleepy drench</l>
     <l n="873">Of that forgetful lake benumb not still ,</l>
     <l n="874">That in our proper motion we ascend</l>
     <l n="875">Up to our native seat ; descent and fall</l>
     <l n="876">To us is adverse . Who but felt of late ,</l>
     <l n="877">When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear</l>
     <l n="878">Insulting , and pursued us through the Deep ,</l>
     <l n="879">With what compulsion and laborious flight</l>
     <l n="880">We sunk thus low ? Th ’ ascent is easy , then ;</l>
     <l n="881">Th ’ event is feared ! Should we again provoke</l>
     <l n="882">Our stronger , some worse way his wrath may find</l>
     <l n="883">To our destruction , if there be in Hell</l>
     <l n="884">Fear to be worse destroyed ! What can be worse</l>
     <l n="885">Than to dwell here , driven out from bliss , condemned</l>
     <l n="886">In this abhorred deep to utter woe !</l>
     <l n="887">Where pain of unextinguishable fire</l>
     <l n="888">Must exercise us without hope of end</l>
     <l n="889">The vassals of his anger , when the scourge</l>
     <l n="890">Inexorably , and the torturing hour ,</l>
     <l n="891">Calls us to penance ? More destroyed than thus ,</l>
     <l n="892">We should be quite abolished , and expire .</l>
     <l n="893">What fear we then ? what doubt we to incense</l>
     <l n="894">His utmost ire ? which , to the height enraged ,</l>
     <l n="895">Will either quite consume us , and reduce</l>
     <l n="896">To nothing this essential — happier far</l>
     <l n="897">Than miserable to have eternal being !—</l>
     <l n="898">Or , if our substance be indeed divine ,</l>
     <l n="899">And cannot cease to be , we are at worst</l>
     <l n="900">On this side nothing ; and by proof we feel</l>
     <l n="901">Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="902">And with perpetual inroads to alarm ,</l>
     <l n="903">Though inaccessible , his fatal throne :</l>
     <l n="904">Which , if not victory , is yet revenge . ”</l>
     <l n="905">He ended frowning , and his look denounced</l>
     <l n="906">Desperate revenge , and battle dangerous</l>
     <l n="907">To less than gods . On th ’ other side up rose</l>
     <l n="908">Belial , in act more graceful and humane .</l>
     <l n="909">A fairer person lost not Heaven ; he seemed</l>
     <l n="910">For dignity composed , and high exploit .</l>
     <l n="911">But all was false and hollow ; though his tongue</l>
     <l n="912">Dropped manna , and could make the worse appear</l>
     <l n="913">The better reason , to perplex and dash</l>
     <l n="914">Maturest counsels : for his thoughts were low —</l>
     <l n="915">To vice industrious , but to nobler deeds</l>
     <l n="916">Timorous and slothful . Yet he pleased the ear ,</l>
     <l n="917">And with persuasive accent thus began :—</l>
     <l n="918">“ I should be much for open war , O Peers ,</l>
     <l n="919">As not behind in hate , if what was urged</l>
     <l n="920">Main reason to persuade immediate war</l>
     <l n="921">Did not dissuade me most , and seem to cast</l>
     <l n="922">Ominous conjecture on the whole success ;</l>
     <l n="923">When he who most excels in fact of arms ,</l>
     <l n="924">In what he counsels and in what excels</l>
     <l n="925">Mistrustful , grounds his courage on despair</l>
     <l n="926">And utter dissolution , as the scope</l>
     <l n="927">Of all his aim , after some dire revenge .</l>
     <l n="928">First , what revenge ? The towers of Heaven are filled</l>
     <l n="929">With armed watch , that render all access</l>
     <l n="930">Impregnable : oft on the bordering Deep</l>
     <l n="931">Encamp their legions , or with obscure wing</l>
     <l n="932">Scout far and wide into the realm of Night ,</l>
     <l n="933">Scorning surprise . Or , could we break our way</l>
     <l n="934">By force , and at our heels all Hell should rise</l>
     <l n="935">With blackest insurrection to confound</l>
     <l n="936">Heaven 's purest light , yet our great Enemy ,</l>
     <l n="937">All incorruptible , would on his throne</l>
     <l n="938">Sit unpolluted , and th ’ ethereal mould ,</l>
     <l n="939">Incapable of stain , would soon expel</l>
     <l n="940">Her mischief , and purge off the baser fire ,</l>
     <l n="941">Victorious . Thus repulsed , our final hope</l>
     <l n="942">Is flat despair : we must exasperate</l>
     <l n="943">Th ’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage ;</l>
     <l n="944">And that must end us ; that must be our cure —</l>
     <l n="945">To be no more . Sad cure ! for who would lose ,</l>
     <l n="946">Though full of pain , this intellectual being ,</l>
     <l n="947">Those thoughts that wander through eternity ,</l>
     <l n="948">To perish rather , swallowed up and lost</l>
     <l n="949">In the wide womb of uncreated Night ,</l>
     <l n="950">Devoid of sense and motion ? And who knows ,</l>
     <l n="951">Let this be good , whether our angry Foe</l>
     <l n="952">Can give it , or will ever ? How he can</l>
     <l n="953">Is doubtful ; that he never will is sure .</l>
     <l n="954">Will he , so wise , let loose at once his ire ,</l>
     <l n="955">Belike through impotence or unaware ,</l>
     <l n="956">To give his enemies their wish , and end</l>
     <l n="957">Them in his anger whom his anger saves</l>
     <l n="958">To punish endless ? “ Wherefore cease we , then ? ”</l>
     <l n="959">Say they who counsel war ; “ we are decreed ,</l>
     <l n="960">Reserved , and destined to eternal woe ;</l>
     <l n="961">Whatever doing , what can we suffer more ,</l>
     <l n="962">What can we suffer worse ? ” Is this , then , worst —</l>
     <l n="963">Thus sitting , thus consulting , thus in arms ?</l>
     <l n="964">What when we fled amain , pursued and struck</l>
     <l n="965">With Heaven 's afflicting thunder , and besought</l>
     <l n="966">The Deep to shelter us ? This Hell then seemed</l>
     <l n="967">A refuge from those wounds . Or when we lay</l>
     <l n="968">Chained on the burning lake ? That sure was worse .</l>
     <l n="969">What if the breath that kindled those grim fires ,</l>
     <l n="970">Awaked , should blow them into sevenfold rage ,</l>
     <l n="971">And plunge us in the flames ; or from above</l>
     <l n="972">Should intermitted vengeance arm again</l>
     <l n="973">His red right hand to plague us ? What if all</l>
     <l n="974">Her stores were opened , and this firmament</l>
     <l n="975">Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire ,</l>
     <l n="976">Impendent horrors , threatening hideous fall</l>
     <l n="977">One day upon our heads ; while we perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="978">Designing or exhorting glorious war ,</l>
     <l n="979">Caught in a fiery tempest , shall be hurled ,</l>
     <l n="980">Each on his rock transfixed , the sport and prey</l>
     <l n="981">Or racking whirlwinds , or for ever sunk</l>
     <l n="982">Under yon boiling ocean , wrapt in chains ,</l>
     <l n="983">There to converse with everlasting groans ,</l>
     <l n="984">Unrespited , unpitied , unreprieved ,</l>
     <l n="985">Ages of hopeless end ? This would be worse .</l>
     <l n="986">War , therefore , open or concealed , alike</l>
     <l n="987">My voice dissuades ; for what can force or guile</l>
     <l n="988">With him , or who deceive his mind , whose eye</l>
     <l n="989">Views all things at one view ? He from Heaven 's height</l>
     <l n="990">All these our motions vain sees and derides ,</l>
     <l n="991">Not more almighty to resist our might</l>
     <l n="992">Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles .</l>
     <l n="993">Shall we , then , live thus vile — the race of Heaven</l>
     <l n="994">Thus trampled , thus expelled , to suffer here</l>
     <l n="995">Chains and these torments ? Better these than worse ,</l>
     <l n="996">By my advice ; since fate inevitable</l>
     <l n="997">Subdues us , and omnipotent decree ,</l>
     <l n="998">The Victor 's will . To suffer , as to do ,</l>
     <l n="999">Our strength is equal ; nor the law unjust</l>
     <l n="1000">That so ordains . This was at first resolved ,</l>
     <l n="1001">If we were wise , against so great a foe</l>
     <l n="1002">Contending , and so doubtful what might fall .</l>
     <l n="1003">I laugh when those who at the spear are bold</l>
     <l n="1004">And venturous , if that fail them , shrink , and fear</l>
     <l n="1005">What yet they know must follow — to endure</l>
     <l n="1006">Exile , or igominy , or bonds , or pain ,</l>
     <l n="1007">The sentence of their Conqueror . This is now</l>
     <l n="1008">Our doom ; which if we can sustain and bear ,</l>
     <l n="1009">Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit</l>
     <l n="1010">His anger , and perhaps , thus far removed ,</l>
     <l n="1011">Not mind us not offending , satisfied</l>
     <l n="1012">With what is punished ; whence these raging fires</l>
     <l n="1013">Will slacken , if his breath stir not their flames .</l>
     <l n="1014">Our purer essence then will overcome</l>
     <l n="1015">Their noxious vapour ; or , inured , not feel ;</l>
     <l n="1016">Or , changed at length , and to the place conformed</l>
     <l n="1017">In temper and in nature , will receive</l>
     <l n="1018">Familiar the fierce heat ; and , void of pain ,</l>
     <l n="1019">This horror will grow mild , this darkness light ;</l>
     <l n="1020">Besides what hope the never-ending flight</l>
     <l n="1021">Of future days may bring , what chance , what change</l>
     <l n="1022">Worth waiting — since our present lot appears</l>
     <l n="1023">For happy though but ill , for ill not worst ,</l>
     <l n="1024">If we procure not to ourselves more woe . ”</l>
     <l n="1025">Thus Belial , with words clothed in reason 's garb ,</l>
     <l n="1026">Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth ,</l>
     <l n="1027">Not peace ; and after him thus Mammon spake :—</l>
     <l n="1028">“ Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven</l>
     <l n="1029">We war , if war be best , or to regain</l>
     <l n="1030">Our own right lost . Him to unthrone we then</l>
     <l n="1031">May hope , when everlasting Fate shall yield</l>
     <l n="1032">To fickle Chance , and Chaos judge the strife .</l>
     <l n="1033">The former , vain to hope , argues as vain</l>
     <l n="1034">The latter ; for what place can be for us</l>
     <l n="1035">Within Heaven 's bound , unless Heaven 's Lord supreme</l>
     <l n="1036">We overpower ? Suppose he should relent</l>
     <l n="1037">And publish grace to all , on promise made</l>
     <l n="1038">Of new subjection ; with what eyes could we</l>
     <l n="1039">Stand in his presence humble , and receive</l>
     <l n="1040">Strict laws imposed , to celebrate his throne</l>
     <l n="1041">With warbled hymns , and to his Godhead sing</l>
     <l n="1042">Forced hallelujahs , while he lordly sits</l>
     <l n="1043">Our envied sovereign , and his altar breathes</l>
     <l n="1044">Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers ,</l>
     <l n="1045">Our servile offerings ? This must be our task</l>
     <l n="1046">In Heaven , this our delight . How wearisome</l>
     <l n="1047">Eternity so spent in worship paid</l>
     <l n="1048">To whom we hate ! Let us not then pursue ,</l>
     <l n="1049">By force impossible , by leave obtained</l>
     <l n="1050">Unacceptable , though in Heaven , our state</l>
     <l n="1051">Of splendid vassalage ; but rather seek</l>
     <l n="1052">Our own good from ourselves , and from our own</l>
     <l n="1053">Live to ourselves , though in this vast recess ,</l>
     <l n="1054">Free and to none accountable , preferring</l>
     <l n="1055">Hard liberty before the easy yoke</l>
     <l n="1056">Of servile pomp . Our greatness will appear</l>
     <l n="1057">Then most conspicuous when great things of small ,</l>
     <l n="1058">Useful of hurtful , prosperous of adverse ,</l>
     <l n="1059">We can create , and in what place soe'er</l>
     <l n="1060">Thrive under evil , and work ease out of pain</l>
     <l n="1061">Through labour and endurance . This deep world</l>
     <l n="1062">Of darkness do we dread ? How oft amidst</l>
     <l n="1063">Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven 's all-ruling Sire</l>
     <l n="1064">Choose to reside , his glory unobscured ,</l>
     <l n="1065">And with the majesty of darkness round</l>
     <l n="1066">Covers his throne , from whence deep thunders roar .</l>
     <l n="1067">Mustering their rage , and Heaven resembles Hell !</l>
     <l n="1068">As he our darkness , cannot we his light</l>
     <l n="1069">Imitate when we please ? This desert soil</l>
     <l n="1070">Wants not her hidden lustre , gems and gold ;</l>
     <l n="1071">Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise</l>
     <l n="1072">Magnificence ; and what can Heaven show more ?</l>
     <l n="1073">Our torments also may , in length of time ,</l>
     <l n="1074">Become our elements , these piercing fires</l>
     <l n="1075">As soft as now severe , our temper changed</l>
     <l n="1076">Into their temper ; which must needs remove</l>
     <l n="1077">The sensible of pain . All things invite</l>
     <l n="1078">To peaceful counsels , and the settled state</l>
     <l n="1079">Of order , how in safety best we may</l>
     <l n="1080">Compose our present evils , with regard</l>
     <l n="1081">Of what we are and where , dismissing quite</l>
     <l n="1082">All thoughts of war . Ye have what I advise . ”</l>
     <l n="1083">He scarce had finished , when such murmur filled</l>
     <l n="1084">Th ’ assembly as when hollow rocks retain</l>
     <l n="1085">The sound of blustering winds , which all night long</l>
     <l n="1086">Had roused the sea , now with hoarse cadence lull</l>
     <l n="1087">Seafaring men o'erwatched , whose bark by chance</l>
     <l n="1088">Or pinnace , anchors in a craggy bay</l>
     <l n="1089">After the tempest . Such applause was heard</l>
     <l n="1090">As Mammon ended , and his sentence pleased ,</l>
     <l n="1091">Advising peace : for such another field</l>
     <l n="1092">They dreaded worse than Hell ; so much the fear</l>
     <l n="1093">Of thunder and the sword of Michael</l>
     <l n="1094">Wrought still within them ; and no less desire</l>
     <l n="1095">To found this nether empire , which might rise ,</l>
     <l n="1096">By policy and long process of time ,</l>
     <l n="1097">In emulation opposite to Heaven .</l>
     <l n="1098">Which when Beelzebub perceived — than whom ,</l>
     <l n="1099">Satan except , none higher sat — with grave</l>
     <l n="1100">Aspect he rose , and in his rising seemed</l>
     <l n="1101">A pillar of state . Deep on his front engraven</l>
     <l n="1102">Deliberation sat , and public care ;</l>
     <l n="1103">And princely counsel in his face yet shone ,</l>
     <l n="1104">Majestic , though in ruin . Sage he stood</l>
     <l n="1105">With Atlantean shoulders , fit to bear</l>
     <l n="1106">The weight of mightiest monarchies ; his look</l>
     <l n="1107">Drew audience and attention still as night</l>
     <l n="1108">Or summer 's noontide air , while thus he spake :—</l>
     <l n="1109">“ Thrones and Imperial Powers , Offspring of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="1110">Ethereal Virtues ! or these titles now</l>
     <l n="1111">Must we renounce , and , changing style , be called</l>
     <l n="1112">Princes of Hell ? for so the popular vote</l>
     <l n="1113">Inclines — here to continue , and build up here</l>
     <l n="1114">A growing empire ; doubtless ! while we dream ,</l>
     <l n="1115">And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed</l>
     <l n="1116">This place our dungeon , not our safe retreat</l>
     <l n="1117">Beyond his potent arm , to live exempt</l>
     <l n="1118">From Heaven 's high jurisdiction , in new league</l>
     <l n="1119">Banded against his throne , but to remain</l>
     <l n="1120">In strictest bondage , though thus far removed ,</l>
     <l n="1121">Under th ’ inevitable curb , reserved</l>
     <l n="1122">His captive multitude . For he , to be sure ,</l>
     <l n="1123">In height or depth , still first and last will reign</l>
     <l n="1124">Sole king , and of his kingdom lose no part</l>
     <l n="1125">By our revolt , but over Hell extend</l>
     <l n="1126">His empire , and with iron sceptre rule</l>
     <l n="1127">Us here , as with his golden those in Heaven .</l>
     <l n="1128">What sit we then projecting peace and war ?</l>
     <l n="1129">War hath determined us and foiled with loss</l>
     <l n="1130">Irreparable ; terms of peace yet none</l>
     <l n="1131">Vouchsafed or sought ; for what peace will be given</l>
     <l n="1132">To us enslaved , but custody severe ,</l>
     <l n="1133">And stripes and arbitrary punishment</l>
     <l n="1134">Inflicted ? and what peace can we return ,</l>
     <l n="1135">But , to our power , hostility and hate ,</l>
     <l n="1136">Untamed reluctance , and revenge , though slow ,</l>
     <l n="1137">Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least</l>
     <l n="1138">May reap his conquest , and may least rejoice</l>
     <l n="1139">In doing what we most in suffering feel ?</l>
     <l n="1140">Nor will occasion want , nor shall we need</l>
     <l n="1141">With dangerous expedition to invade</l>
     <l n="1142">Heaven , whose high walls fear no assault or siege ,</l>
     <l n="1143">Or ambush from the Deep . What if we find</l>
     <l n="1144">Some easier enterprise ? There is a place</l>
     <l n="1145">( If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven</l>
     <l n="1146">Err not ) — another World , the happy seat</l>
     <l n="1147">Of some new race , called Man , about this time</l>
     <l n="1148">To be created like to us , though less</l>
     <l n="1149">In power and excellence , but favoured more</l>
     <l n="1150">Of him who rules above ; so was his will</l>
     <l n="1151">Pronounced among the Gods , and by an oath</l>
     <l n="1152">That shook Heaven 's whole circumference confirmed .</l>
     <l n="1153">Thither let us bend all our thoughts , to learn</l>
     <l n="1154">What creatures there inhabit , of what mould</l>
     <l n="1155">Or substance , how endued , and what their power</l>
     <l n="1156">And where their weakness : how attempted best ,</l>
     <l n="1157">By force of subtlety . Though Heaven be shut ,</l>
     <l n="1158">And Heaven 's high Arbitrator sit secure</l>
     <l n="1159">In his own strength , this place may lie exposed ,</l>
     <l n="1160">The utmost border of his kingdom , left</l>
     <l n="1161">To their defence who hold it : here , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="1162">Some advantageous act may be achieved</l>
     <l n="1163">By sudden onset — either with Hell-fire</l>
     <l n="1164">To waste his whole creation , or possess</l>
     <l n="1165">All as our own , and drive , as we were driven ,</l>
     <l n="1166">The puny habitants ; or , if not drive ,</l>
     <l n="1167">Seduce them to our party , that their God</l>
     <l n="1168">May prove their foe , and with repenting hand</l>
     <l n="1169">Abolish his own works . This would surpass</l>
     <l n="1170">Common revenge , and interrupt his joy</l>
     <l n="1171">In our confusion , and our joy upraise</l>
     <l n="1172">In his disturbance ; when his darling sons ,</l>
     <l n="1173">Hurled headlong to partake with us , shall curse</l>
     <l n="1174">Their frail original , and faded bliss —</l>
     <l n="1175">Faded so soon ! Advise if this be worth</l>
     <l n="1176">Attempting , or to sit in darkness here</l>
     <l n="1177">Hatching vain empires . ” Thus Beelzebub</l>
     <l n="1178">Pleaded his devilish counsel — first devised</l>
     <l n="1179">By Satan , and in part proposed : for whence ,</l>
     <l n="1180">But from the author of all ill , could spring</l>
     <l n="1181">So deep a malice , to confound the race</l>
     <l n="1182">Of mankind in one root , and Earth with Hell</l>
     <l n="1183">To mingle and involve , done all to spite</l>
     <l n="1184">The great Creator ? But their spite still serves</l>
     <l n="1185">His glory to augment . The bold design</l>
     <l n="1186">Pleased highly those infernal States , and joy</l>
     <l n="1187">Sparkled in all their eyes : with full assent</l>
     <l n="1188">They vote : whereat his speech he thus renews :—</l>
     <l n="1189">“ Well have ye judged , well ended long debate ,</l>
     <l n="1190">Synod of Gods , and , like to what ye are ,</l>
     <l n="1191">Great things resolved , which from the lowest deep</l>
     <l n="1192">Will once more lift us up , in spite of fate ,</l>
     <l n="1193">Nearer our ancient seat — perhaps in view</l>
     <l n="1194">Of those bright confines , whence , with neighbouring arms ,</l>
     <l n="1195">And opportune excursion , we may chance</l>
     <l n="1196">Re-enter Heaven ; or else in some mild zone</l>
     <l n="1197">Dwell , not unvisited of Heaven 's fair light ,</l>
     <l n="1198">Secure , and at the brightening orient beam</l>
     <l n="1199">Purge off this gloom : the soft delicious air ,</l>
     <l n="1200">To heal the scar of these corrosive fires ,</l>
     <l n="1201">Shall breathe her balm . But , first , whom shall we send</l>
     <l n="1202">In search of this new World ? whom shall we find</l>
     <l n="1203">Sufficient ? who shall tempt with wandering feet</l>
     <l n="1204">The dark , unbottomed , infinite Abyss ,</l>
     <l n="1205">And through the palpable obscure find out</l>
     <l n="1206">His uncouth way , or spread his airy flight ,</l>
     <l n="1207">Upborne with indefatigable wings</l>
     <l n="1208">Over the vast abrupt , ere he arrive</l>
     <l n="1209">The happy Isle ? What strength , what art , can then</l>
     <l n="1210">Suffice , or what evasion bear him safe ,</l>
     <l n="1211">Through the strict senteries and stations thick</l>
     <l n="1212">Of Angels watching round ? Here he had need</l>
     <l n="1213">All circumspection : and we now no less</l>
     <l n="1214">Choice in our suffrage ; for on whom we send</l>
     <l n="1215">The weight of all , and our last hope , relies . ”</l>
     <l n="1216">This said , he sat ; and expectation held</l>
     <l n="1217">His look suspense , awaiting who appeared</l>
     <l n="1218">To second , or oppose , or undertake</l>
     <l n="1219">The perilous attempt . But all sat mute ,</l>
     <l n="1220">Pondering the danger with deep thoughts ; and each</l>
     <l n="1221">In other 's countenance read his own dismay ,</l>
     <l n="1222">Astonished . None among the choice and prime</l>
     <l n="1223">Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found</l>
     <l n="1224">So hardy as to proffer or accept ,</l>
     <l n="1225">Alone , the dreadful voyage ; till , at last ,</l>
     <l n="1226">Satan , whom now transcendent glory raised</l>
     <l n="1227">Above his fellows , with monarchal pride</l>
     <l n="1228">Conscious of highest worth , unmoved thus spake :—</l>
     <l n="1229">“ O Progeny of Heaven ! Empyreal Thrones !</l>
     <l n="1230">With reason hath deep silence and demur</l>
     <l n="1231">Seized us , though undismayed . Long is the way</l>
     <l n="1232">And hard , that out of Hell leads up to light .</l>
     <l n="1233">Our prison strong , this huge convex of fire ,</l>
     <l n="1234">Outrageous to devour , immures us round</l>
     <l n="1235">Ninefold ; and gates of burning adamant ,</l>
     <l n="1236">Barred over us , prohibit all egress .</l>
     <l n="1237">These passed , if any pass , the void profound</l>
     <l n="1238">Of unessential Night receives him next ,</l>
     <l n="1239">Wide-gaping , and with utter loss of being</l>
     <l n="1240">Threatens him , plunged in that abortive gulf .</l>
     <l n="1241">If thence he scape , into whatever world ,</l>
     <l n="1242">Or unknown region , what remains him less</l>
     <l n="1243">Than unknown dangers , and as hard escape ?</l>
     <l n="1244">But I should ill become this throne , O Peers ,</l>
     <l n="1245">And this imperial sovereignty , adorned</l>
     <l n="1246">With splendour , armed with power , if aught proposed</l>
     <l n="1247">And judged of public moment in the shape</l>
     <l n="1248">Of difficulty or danger , could deter</l>
     <l n="1249">Me from attempting . Wherefore do I assume</l>
     <l n="1250">These royalties , and not refuse to reign ,</l>
     <l n="1251">Refusing to accept as great a share</l>
     <l n="1252">Of hazard as of honour , due alike</l>
     <l n="1253">To him who reigns , and so much to him due</l>
     <l n="1254">Of hazard more as he above the rest</l>
     <l n="1255">High honoured sits ? Go , therefore , mighty Powers ,</l>
     <l n="1256">Terror of Heaven , though fallen ; intend at home ,</l>
     <l n="1257">While here shall be our home , what best may ease</l>
     <l n="1258">The present misery , and render Hell</l>
     <l n="1259">More tolerable ; if there be cure or charm</l>
     <l n="1260">To respite , or deceive , or slack the pain</l>
     <l n="1261">Of this ill mansion : intermit no watch</l>
     <l n="1262">Against a wakeful foe , while I abroad</l>
     <l n="1263">Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek</l>
     <l n="1264">Deliverance for us all . This enterprise</l>
     <l n="1265">None shall partake with me . ” Thus saying , rose</l>
     <l n="1266">The Monarch , and prevented all reply ;</l>
     <l n="1267">Prudent lest , from his resolution raised ,</l>
     <l n="1268">Others among the chief might offer now ,</l>
     <l n="1269">Certain to be refused , what erst they feared ,</l>
     <l n="1270">And , so refused , might in opinion stand</l>
     <l n="1271">His rivals , winning cheap the high repute</l>
     <l n="1272">Which he through hazard huge must earn . But they</l>
     <l n="1273">Dreaded not more th ’ adventure than his voice</l>
     <l n="1274">Forbidding ; and at once with him they rose .</l>
     <l n="1275">Their rising all at once was as the sound</l>
     <l n="1276">Of thunder heard remote . Towards him they bend</l>
     <l n="1277">With awful reverence prone , and as a God</l>
     <l n="1278">Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven .</l>
     <l n="1279">Nor failed they to express how much they praised</l>
     <l n="1280">That for the general safety he despised</l>
     <l n="1281">His own : for neither do the Spirits damned</l>
     <l n="1282">Lose all their virtue ; lest bad men should boast</l>
     <l n="1283">Their specious deeds on earth , which glory excites ,</l>
     <l n="1284">Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal .</l>
     <l n="1285">Thus they their doubtful consultations dark</l>
     <l n="1286">Ended , rejoicing in their matchless Chief :</l>
     <l n="1287">As , when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds</l>
     <l n="1288">Ascending , while the north wind sleeps , o'erspread</l>
     <l n="1289">Heaven 's cheerful face , the louring element</l>
     <l n="1290">Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower ,</l>
     <l n="1291">If chance the radiant sun , with farewell sweet ,</l>
     <l n="1292">Extend his evening beam , the fields revive ,</l>
     <l n="1293">The birds their notes renew , and bleating herds</l>
     <l n="1294">Attest their joy , that hill and valley rings .</l>
     <l n="1295">O shame to men ! Devil with devil damned</l>
     <l n="1296">Firm concord holds ; men only disagree</l>
     <l n="1297">Of creatures rational , though under hope</l>
     <l n="1298">Of heavenly grace , and , God proclaiming peace ,</l>
     <l n="1299">Yet live in hatred , enmity , and strife</l>
     <l n="1300">Among themselves , and levy cruel wars</l>
     <l n="1301">Wasting the earth , each other to destroy :</l>
     <l n="1302">As if ( which might induce us to accord )</l>
     <l n="1303">Man had not hellish foes enow besides ,</l>
     <l n="1304">That day and night for his destruction wait !</l>
     <l n="1305">The Stygian council thus dissolved ; and forth</l>
     <l n="1306">In order came the grand infernal Peers :</l>
     <l n="1307">Midst came their mighty Paramount , and seemed</l>
     <l n="1308">Alone th ’ antagonist of Heaven , nor less</l>
     <l n="1309">Than Hell 's dread Emperor , with pomp supreme ,</l>
     <l n="1310">And god-like imitated state : him round</l>
     <l n="1311">A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed</l>
     <l n="1312">With bright emblazonry , and horrent arms .</l>
     <l n="1313">Then of their session ended they bid cry</l>
     <l n="1314">With trumpet 's regal sound the great result :</l>
     <l n="1315">Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim</l>
     <l n="1316">Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy ,</l>
     <l n="1317">By herald 's voice explained ; the hollow Abyss</l>
     <l n="1318">Heard far and wide , and all the host of Hell</l>
     <l n="1319">With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim .</l>
     <l n="1320">Thence more at ease their minds , and somewhat raised</l>
     <l n="1321">By false presumptuous hope , the ranged Powers</l>
     <l n="1322">Disband ; and , wandering , each his several way</l>
     <l n="1323">Pursues , as inclination or sad choice</l>
     <l n="1324">Leads him perplexed , where he may likeliest find</l>
     <l n="1325">Truce to his restless thoughts , and entertain</l>
     <l n="1326">The irksome hours , till his great Chief return .</l>
     <l n="1327">Part on the plain , or in the air sublime ,</l>
     <l n="1328">Upon the wing or in swift race contend ,</l>
     <l n="1329">As at th ’ Olympian games or Pythian fields ;</l>
     <l n="1330">Part curb their fiery steeds , or shun the goal</l>
     <l n="1331">With rapid wheels , or fronted brigades form :</l>
     <l n="1332">As when , to warn proud cities , war appears</l>
     <l n="1333">Waged in the troubled sky , and armies rush</l>
     <l n="1334">To battle in the clouds ; before each van</l>
     <l n="1335">Prick forth the airy knights , and couch their spears ,</l>
     <l n="1336">Till thickest legions close ; with feats of arms</l>
     <l n="1337">From either end of heaven the welkin burns .</l>
     <l n="1338">Others , with vast Typhoean rage , more fell ,</l>
     <l n="1339">Rend up both rocks and hills , and ride the air</l>
     <l n="1340">In whirlwind ; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar :—</l>
     <l n="1341">As when Alcides , from Oechalia crowned</l>
     <l n="1342">With conquest , felt th ’ envenomed robe , and tore</l>
     <l n="1343">Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines ,</l>
     <l n="1344">And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw</l>
     <l n="1345">Into th ’ Euboic sea . Others , more mild ,</l>
     <l n="1346">Retreated in a silent valley , sing</l>
     <l n="1347">With notes angelical to many a harp</l>
     <l n="1348">Their own heroic deeds , and hapless fall</l>
     <l n="1349">By doom of battle , and complain that Fate</l>
     <l n="1350">Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance .</l>
     <l n="1351">Their song was partial ; but the harmony</l>
     <l n="1352">( What could it less when Spirits immortal sing ? )</l>
     <l n="1353">Suspended Hell , and took with ravishment</l>
     <l n="1354">The thronging audience . In discourse more sweet</l>
     <l n="1355">( For Eloquence the Soul , Song charms the Sense )</l>
     <l n="1356">Others apart sat on a hill retired ,</l>
     <l n="1357">In thoughts more elevate , and reasoned high</l>
     <l n="1358">Of Providence , Foreknowledge , Will , and Fate —</l>
     <l n="1359">Fixed fate , free will , foreknowledge absolute ,</l>
     <l n="1360">And found no end , in wandering mazes lost .</l>
     <l n="1361">Of good and evil much they argued then ,</l>
     <l n="1362">Of happiness and final misery ,</l>
     <l n="1363">Passion and apathy , and glory and shame :</l>
     <l n="1364">Vain wisdom all , and false philosophy !—</l>
     <l n="1365">Yet , with a pleasing sorcery , could charm</l>
     <l n="1366">Pain for a while or anguish , and excite</l>
     <l n="1367">Fallacious hope , or arm th ’ obdured breast</l>
     <l n="1368">With stubborn patience as with triple steel .</l>
     <l n="1369">Another part , in squadrons and gross bands ,</l>
     <l n="1370">On bold adventure to discover wide</l>
     <l n="1371">That dismal world , if any clime perhaps</l>
     <l n="1372">Might yield them easier habitation , bend</l>
     <l n="1373">Four ways their flying march , along the banks</l>
     <l n="1374">Of four infernal rivers , that disgorge</l>
     <l n="1375">Into the burning lake their baleful streams —</l>
     <l n="1376">Abhorred Styx , the flood of deadly hate ;</l>
     <l n="1377">Sad Acheron of sorrow , black and deep ;</l>
     <l n="1378">Cocytus , named of lamentation loud</l>
     <l n="1379">Heard on the rueful stream ; fierce Phlegeton ,</l>
     <l n="1380">Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage .</l>
     <l n="1381">Far off from these , a slow and silent stream ,</l>
     <l n="1382">Lethe , the river of oblivion , rolls</l>
     <l n="1383">Her watery labyrinth , whereof who drinks</l>
     <l n="1384">Forthwith his former state and being forgets —</l>
     <l n="1385">Forgets both joy and grief , pleasure and pain .</l>
     <l n="1386">Beyond this flood a frozen continent</l>
     <l n="1387">Lies dark and wild , beat with perpetual storms</l>
     <l n="1388">Of whirlwind and dire hail , which on firm land</l>
     <l n="1389">Thaws not , but gathers heap , and ruin seems</l>
     <l n="1390">Of ancient pile ; all else deep snow and ice ,</l>
     <l n="1391">A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog</l>
     <l n="1392">Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old ,</l>
     <l n="1393">Where armies whole have sunk : the parching air</l>
     <l n="1394">Burns frore , and cold performs th ’ effect of fire .</l>
     <l n="1395">Thither , by harpy-footed Furies haled ,</l>
     <l n="1396">At certain revolutions all the damned</l>
     <l n="1397">Are brought ; and feel by turns the bitter change</l>
     <l n="1398">Of fierce extremes , extremes by change more fierce ,</l>
     <l n="1399">From beds of raging fire to starve in ice</l>
     <l n="1400">Their soft ethereal warmth , and there to pine</l>
     <l n="1401">Immovable , infixed , and frozen round</l>
     <l n="1402">Periods of time ,— thence hurried back to fire .</l>
     <l n="1403">They ferry over this Lethean sound</l>
     <l n="1404">Both to and fro , their sorrow to augment ,</l>
     <l n="1405">And wish and struggle , as they pass , to reach</l>
     <l n="1406">The tempting stream , with one small drop to lose</l>
     <l n="1407">In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe ,</l>
     <l n="1408">All in one moment , and so near the brink ;</l>
     <l n="1409">But Fate withstands , and , to oppose th ’ attempt ,</l>
     <l n="1410">Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards</l>
     <l n="1411">The ford , and of itself the water flies</l>
     <l n="1412">All taste of living wight , as once it fled</l>
     <l n="1413">The lip of Tantalus . Thus roving on</l>
     <l n="1414">In confused march forlorn , th ’ adventurous bands ,</l>
     <l n="1415">With shuddering horror pale , and eyes aghast ,</l>
     <l n="1416">Viewed first their lamentable lot , and found</l>
     <l n="1417">No rest . Through many a dark and dreary vale</l>
     <l n="1418">They passed , and many a region dolorous ,</l>
     <l n="1419">O'er many a frozen , many a fiery alp ,</l>
     <l n="1420">Rocks , caves , lakes , fens , bogs , dens , and shades of death —</l>
     <l n="1421">A universe of death , which God by curse</l>
     <l n="1422">Created evil , for evil only good ;</l>
     <l n="1423">Where all life dies , death lives , and Nature breeds ,</l>
     <l n="1424">Perverse , all monstrous , all prodigious things ,</l>
     <l n="1425">Obominable , inutterable , and worse</l>
     <l n="1426">Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived ,</l>
     <l n="1427">Gorgons , and Hydras , and Chimeras dire .</l>
     <l n="1428">Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man ,</l>
     <l n="1429">Satan , with thoughts inflamed of highest design ,</l>
     <l n="1430">Puts on swift wings , and toward the gates of Hell</l>
     <l n="1431">Explores his solitary flight : sometimes</l>
     <l n="1432">He scours the right hand coast , sometimes the left ;</l>
     <l n="1433">Now shaves with level wing the deep , then soars</l>
     <l n="1434">Up to the fiery concave towering high .</l>
     <l n="1435">As when far off at sea a fleet descried</l>
     <l n="1436">Hangs in the clouds , by equinoctial winds</l>
     <l n="1437">Close sailing from Bengala , or the isles</l>
     <l n="1438">Of Ternate and Tidore , whence merchants bring</l>
     <l n="1439">Their spicy drugs ; they on the trading flood ,</l>
     <l n="1440">Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape ,</l>
     <l n="1441">Ply stemming nightly toward the pole : so seemed</l>
     <l n="1442">Far off the flying Fiend . At last appear</l>
     <l n="1443">Hell-bounds , high reaching to the horrid roof ,</l>
     <l n="1444">And thrice threefold the gates ; three folds were brass ,</l>
     <l n="1445">Three iron , three of adamantine rock ,</l>
     <l n="1446">Impenetrable , impaled with circling fire ,</l>
     <l n="1447">Yet unconsumed . Before the gates there sat</l>
     <l n="1448">On either side a formidable Shape .</l>
     <l n="1449">The one seemed woman to the waist , and fair ,</l>
     <l n="1450">But ended foul in many a scaly fold ,</l>
     <l n="1451">Voluminous and vast — a serpent armed</l>
     <l n="1452">With mortal sting . About her middle round</l>
     <l n="1453">A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked</l>
     <l n="1454">With wide Cerberean mouths full loud , and rung</l>
     <l n="1455">A hideous peal ; yet , when they list , would creep ,</l>
     <l n="1456">If aught disturbed their noise , into her womb ,</l>
     <l n="1457">And kennel there ; yet there still barked and howled</l>
     <l n="1458">Within unseen . Far less abhorred than these</l>
     <l n="1459">Vexed Scylla , bathing in the sea that parts</l>
     <l n="1460">Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore ;</l>
     <l n="1461">Nor uglier follow the night-hag , when , called</l>
     <l n="1462">In secret , riding through the air she comes ,</l>
     <l n="1463">Lured with the smell of infant blood , to dance</l>
     <l n="1464">With Lapland witches , while the labouring moon</l>
     <l n="1465">Eclipses at their charms . The other Shape —</l>
     <l n="1466">If shape it might be called that shape had none</l>
     <l n="1467">Distinguishable in member , joint , or limb ;</l>
     <l n="1468">Or substance might be called that shadow seemed ,</l>
     <l n="1469">For each seemed either — black it stood as Night ,</l>
     <l n="1470">Fierce as ten Furies , terrible as Hell ,</l>
     <l n="1471">And shook a dreadful dart : what seemed his head</l>
     <l n="1472">The likeness of a kingly crown had on .</l>
     <l n="1473">Satan was now at hand , and from his seat</l>
     <l n="1474">The monster moving onward came as fast</l>
     <l n="1475">With horrid strides ; Hell trembled as he strode .</l>
     <l n="1476">Th ’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admired —</l>
     <l n="1477">Admired , not feared ( God and his Son except ,</l>
     <l n="1478">Created thing naught valued he nor shunned ) ,</l>
     <l n="1479">And with disdainful look thus first began :—</l>
     <l n="1480">“ Whence and what art thou , execrable Shape ,</l>
     <l n="1481">That dar'st , though grim and terrible , advance</l>
     <l n="1482">Thy miscreated front athwart my way</l>
     <l n="1483">To yonder gates ? Through them I mean to pass ,</l>
     <l n="1484">That be assured , without leave asked of thee .</l>
     <l n="1485">Retire ; or taste thy folly , and learn by proof ,</l>
     <l n="1486">Hell-born , not to contend with Spirits of Heaven . ”</l>
     <l n="1487">To whom the Goblin , full of wrath , replied :—</l>
     <l n="1488">“ Art thou that traitor Angel ? art thou he ,</l>
     <l n="1489">Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith , till then</l>
     <l n="1490">Unbroken , and in proud rebellious arms</l>
     <l n="1491">Drew after him the third part of Heaven 's sons ,</l>
     <l n="1492">Conjured against the Highest — for which both thou</l>
     <l n="1493">And they , outcast from God , are here condemned</l>
     <l n="1494">To waste eternal days in woe and pain ?</l>
     <l n="1495">And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven</l>
     <l n="1496">Hell-doomed , and breath'st defiance here and scorn ,</l>
     <l n="1497">Where I reign king , and , to enrage thee more ,</l>
     <l n="1498">Thy king and lord ? Back to thy punishment ,</l>
     <l n="1499">False fugitive ; and to thy speed add wings ,</l>
     <l n="1500">Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue</l>
     <l n="1501">Thy lingering , or with one stroke of this dart</l>
     <l n="1502">Strange horror seize thee , and pangs unfelt before . ”</l>
     <l n="1503">So spake the grisly Terror , and in shape ,</l>
     <l n="1504">So speaking and so threatening , grew tenfold ,</l>
     <l n="1505">More dreadful and deform . On th ’ other side ,</l>
     <l n="1506">Incensed with indignation , Satan stood</l>
     <l n="1507">Unterrified , and like a comet burned ,</l>
     <l n="1508">That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge</l>
     <l n="1509">In th ’ arctic sky , and from his horrid hair</l>
     <l n="1510">Shakes pestilence and war . Each at the head</l>
     <l n="1511">Levelled his deadly aim ; their fatal hands</l>
     <l n="1512">No second stroke intend ; and such a frown</l>
     <l n="1513">Each cast at th ’ other as when two black clouds ,</l>
     <l n="1514">With heaven 's artillery fraught , came rattling on</l>
     <l n="1515">Over the Caspian ,— then stand front to front</l>
     <l n="1516">Hovering a space , till winds the signal blow</l>
     <l n="1517">To join their dark encounter in mid-air .</l>
     <l n="1518">So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell</l>
     <l n="1519">Grew darker at their frown ; so matched they stood ;</l>
     <l n="1520">For never but once more was wither like</l>
     <l n="1521">To meet so great a foe . And now great deeds</l>
     <l n="1522">Had been achieved , whereof all Hell had rung ,</l>
     <l n="1523">Had not the snaky Sorceress , that sat</l>
     <l n="1524">Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key ,</l>
     <l n="1525">Risen , and with hideous outcry rushed between .</l>
     <l n="1526">“ O father , what intends thy hand , ” she cried ,</l>
     <l n="1527">“ Against thy only son ? What fury , O son ,</l>
     <l n="1528">Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart</l>
     <l n="1529">Against thy father 's head ? And know'st for whom ?</l>
     <l n="1530">For him who sits above , and laughs the while</l>
     <l n="1531">At thee , ordained his drudge to execute</l>
     <l n="1532">Whate'er his wrath , which he calls justice , bids —</l>
     <l n="1533">His wrath , which one day will destroy ye both ! ”</l>
     <l n="1534">She spake , and at her words the hellish Pest</l>
     <l n="1535">Forbore : then these to her Satan returned :—</l>
     <l n="1536">“ So strange thy outcry , and thy words so strange</l>
     <l n="1537">Thou interposest , that my sudden hand ,</l>
     <l n="1538">Prevented , spares to tell thee yet by deeds</l>
     <l n="1539">What it intends , till first I know of thee</l>
     <l n="1540">What thing thou art , thus double-formed , and why ,</l>
     <l n="1541">In this infernal vale first met , thou call'st</l>
     <l n="1542">Me father , and that phantasm call'st my son .</l>
     <l n="1543">I know thee not , nor ever saw till now</l>
     <l n="1544">Sight more detestable than him and thee . ”</l>
     <l n="1545">T ’ whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied :—</l>
     <l n="1546">“ Hast thou forgot me , then ; and do I seem</l>
     <l n="1547">Now in thine eye so foul ?— once deemed so fair</l>
     <l n="1548">In Heaven , when at th ’ assembly , and in sight</l>
     <l n="1549">Of all the Seraphim with thee combined</l>
     <l n="1550">In bold conspiracy against Heaven 's King ,</l>
     <l n="1551">All on a sudden miserable pain</l>
     <l n="1552">Surprised thee , dim thine eyes and dizzy swum</l>
     <l n="1553">In darkness , while thy head flames thick and fast</l>
     <l n="1554">Threw forth , till on the left side opening wide ,</l>
     <l n="1555">Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright ,</l>
     <l n="1556">Then shining heavenly fair , a goddess armed ,</l>
     <l n="1557">Out of thy head I sprung . Amazement seized</l>
     <l n="1558">All th ’ host of Heaven ; back they recoiled afraid</l>
     <l n="1559">At first , and called me Sin , and for a sign</l>
     <l n="1560">Portentous held me ; but , familiar grown ,</l>
     <l n="1561">I pleased , and with attractive graces won</l>
     <l n="1562">The most averse — thee chiefly , who , full oft</l>
     <l n="1563">Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing ,</l>
     <l n="1564">Becam'st enamoured ; and such joy thou took'st</l>
     <l n="1565">With me in secret that my womb conceived</l>
     <l n="1566">A growing burden . Meanwhile war arose ,</l>
     <l n="1567">And fields were fought in Heaven : wherein remained</l>
     <l n="1568">( For what could else ? ) to our Almighty Foe</l>
     <l n="1569">Clear victory ; to our part loss and rout</l>
     <l n="1570">Through all the Empyrean . Down they fell ,</l>
     <l n="1571">Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven , down</l>
     <l n="1572">Into this Deep ; and in the general fall</l>
     <l n="1573">I also : at which time this powerful key</l>
     <l n="1574">Into my hands was given , with charge to keep</l>
     <l n="1575">These gates for ever shut , which none can pass</l>
     <l n="1576">Without my opening . Pensive here I sat</l>
     <l n="1577">Alone ; but long I sat not , till my womb ,</l>
     <l n="1578">Pregnant by thee , and now excessive grown ,</l>
     <l n="1579">Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes .</l>
     <l n="1580">At last this odious offspring whom thou seest ,</l>
     <l n="1581">Thine own begotten , breaking violent way ,</l>
     <l n="1582">Tore through my entrails , that , with fear and pain</l>
     <l n="1583">Distorted , all my nether shape thus grew</l>
     <l n="1584">Transformed : but he my inbred enemy</l>
     <l n="1585">Forth issued , brandishing his fatal dart ,</l>
     <l n="1586">Made to destroy . I fled , and cried out Death !</l>
     <l n="1587">Hell trembled at the hideous name , and sighed</l>
     <l n="1588">From all her caves , and back resounded Death !</l>
     <l n="1589">I fled ; but he pursued ( though more , it seems ,</l>
     <l n="1590">Inflamed with lust than rage ) , and , swifter far ,</l>
     <l n="1591">Me overtook , his mother , all dismayed ,</l>
     <l n="1592">And , in embraces forcible and foul</l>
     <l n="1593">Engendering with me , of that rape begot</l>
     <l n="1594">These yelling monsters , that with ceaseless cry</l>
     <l n="1595">Surround me , as thou saw'st — hourly conceived</l>
     <l n="1596">And hourly born , with sorrow infinite</l>
     <l n="1597">To me ; for , when they list , into the womb</l>
     <l n="1598">That bred them they return , and howl , and gnaw</l>
     <l n="1599">My bowels , their repast ; then , bursting forth</l>
     <l n="1600">Afresh , with conscious terrors vex me round ,</l>
     <l n="1601">That rest or intermission none I find .</l>
     <l n="1602">Before mine eyes in opposition sits</l>
     <l n="1603">Grim Death , my son and foe , who set them on ,</l>
     <l n="1604">And me , his parent , would full soon devour</l>
     <l n="1605">For want of other prey , but that he knows</l>
     <l n="1606">His end with mine involved , and knows that I</l>
     <l n="1607">Should prove a bitter morsel , and his bane ,</l>
     <l n="1608">Whenever that shall be : so Fate pronounced .</l>
     <l n="1609">But thou , O father , I forewarn thee , shun</l>
     <l n="1610">His deadly arrow ; neither vainly hope</l>
     <l n="1611">To be invulnerable in those bright arms ,</l>
     <l n="1612">Through tempered heavenly ; for that mortal dint ,</l>
     <l n="1613">Save he who reigns above , none can resist . ”</l>
     <l n="1614">She finished ; and the subtle Fiend his lore</l>
     <l n="1615">Soon learned , now milder , and thus answered smooth :—</l>
     <l n="1616">“ Dear daughter — since thou claim'st me for thy sire ,</l>
     <l n="1617">And my fair son here show'st me , the dear pledge</l>
     <l n="1618">Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven , and joys</l>
     <l n="1619">Then sweet , now sad to mention , through dire change</l>
     <l n="1620">Befallen us unforeseen , unthought-of — know ,</l>
     <l n="1621">I come no enemy , but to set free</l>
     <l n="1622">From out this dark and dismal house of pain</l>
     <l n="1623">Both him and thee , and all the heavenly host</l>
     <l n="1624">Of Spirits that , in our just pretences armed ,</l>
     <l n="1625">Fell with us from on high . From them I go</l>
     <l n="1626">This uncouth errand sole , and one for all</l>
     <l n="1627">Myself expose , with lonely steps to tread</l>
     <l n="1628">Th ’ unfounded Deep , and through the void immense</l>
     <l n="1629">To search , with wandering quest , a place foretold</l>
     <l n="1630">Should be — and , by concurring signs , ere now</l>
     <l n="1631">Created vast and round — a place of bliss</l>
     <l n="1632">In the purlieus of Heaven ; and therein placed</l>
     <l n="1633">A race of upstart creatures , to supply</l>
     <l n="1634">Perhaps our vacant room , though more removed ,</l>
     <l n="1635">Lest Heaven , surcharged with potent multitude ,</l>
     <l n="1636">Might hap to move new broils . Be this , or aught</l>
     <l n="1637">Than this more secret , now designed , I haste</l>
     <l n="1638">To know ; and , this once known , shall soon return ,</l>
     <l n="1639">And bring ye to the place where thou and Death</l>
     <l n="1640">Shall dwell at ease , and up and down unseen</l>
     <l n="1641">Wing silently the buxom air , embalmed</l>
     <l n="1642">With odours . There ye shall be fed and filled</l>
     <l n="1643">Immeasurably ; all things shall be your prey . ”</l>
     <l n="1644">He ceased ; for both seemed highly pleased , and Death</l>
     <l n="1645">Grinned horrible a ghastly smile , to hear</l>
     <l n="1646">His famine should be filled , and blessed his maw</l>
     <l n="1647">Destined to that good hour . No less rejoiced</l>
     <l n="1648">His mother bad , and thus bespake her sire :—</l>
     <l n="1649">“ The key of this infernal Pit , by due</l>
     <l n="1650">And by command of Heaven 's all-powerful King ,</l>
     <l n="1651">I keep , by him forbidden to unlock</l>
     <l n="1652">These adamantine gates ; against all force</l>
     <l n="1653">Death ready stands to interpose his dart ,</l>
     <l n="1654">Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might .</l>
     <l n="1655">But what owe I to his commands above ,</l>
     <l n="1656">Who hates me , and hath hither thrust me down</l>
     <l n="1657">Into this gloom of Tartarus profound ,</l>
     <l n="1658">To sit in hateful office here confined ,</l>
     <l n="1659">Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born —</l>
     <l n="1660">Here in perpetual agony and pain ,</l>
     <l n="1661">With terrors and with clamours compassed round</l>
     <l n="1662">Of mine own brood , that on my bowels feed ?</l>
     <l n="1663">Thou art my father , thou my author , thou</l>
     <l n="1664">My being gav'st me ; whom should I obey</l>
     <l n="1665">But thee ? whom follow ? Thou wilt bring me soon</l>
     <l n="1666">To that new world of light and bliss , among</l>
     <l n="1667">The gods who live at ease , where I shall reign</l>
     <l n="1668">At thy right hand voluptuous , as beseems</l>
     <l n="1669">Thy daughter and thy darling , without end . ”</l>
     <l n="1670">Thus saying , from her side the fatal key ,</l>
     <l n="1671">Sad instrument of all our woe , she took ;</l>
     <l n="1672">And , towards the gate rolling her bestial train ,</l>
     <l n="1673">Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew ,</l>
     <l n="1674">Which , but herself , not all the Stygian Powers</l>
     <l n="1675">Could once have moved ; then in the key-hole turns</l>
     <l n="1676">Th ’ intricate wards , and every bolt and bar</l>
     <l n="1677">Of massy iron or solid rock with ease</l>
     <l n="1678">Unfastens . On a sudden open fly ,</l>
     <l n="1679">With impetuous recoil and jarring sound ,</l>
     <l n="1680">Th ’ infernal doors , and on their hinges grate</l>
     <l n="1681">Harsh thunder , that the lowest bottom shook</l>
     <l n="1682">Of Erebus . She opened ; but to shut</l>
     <l n="1683">Excelled her power : the gates wide open stood ,</l>
     <l n="1684">That with extended wings a bannered host ,</l>
     <l n="1685">Under spread ensigns marching , might pass through</l>
     <l n="1686">With horse and chariots ranked in loose array ;</l>
     <l n="1687">So wide they stood , and like a furnace-mouth</l>
     <l n="1688">Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame .</l>
     <l n="1689">Before their eyes in sudden view appear</l>
     <l n="1690">The secrets of the hoary Deep — a dark</l>
     <l n="1691">Illimitable ocean , without bound ,</l>
     <l n="1692">Without dimension ; where length , breadth , and height ,</l>
     <l n="1693">And time , and place , are lost ; where eldest Night</l>
     <l n="1694">And Chaos , ancestors of Nature , hold</l>
     <l n="1695">Eternal anarchy , amidst the noise</l>
     <l n="1696">Of endless wars , and by confusion stand .</l>
     <l n="1697">For Hot , Cold , Moist , and Dry , four champions fierce ,</l>
     <l n="1698">Strive here for mastery , and to battle bring</l>
     <l n="1699">Their embryon atoms : they around the flag</l>
     <l n="1700">Of each his faction , in their several clans ,</l>
     <l n="1701">Light-armed or heavy , sharp , smooth , swift , or slow ,</l>
     <l n="1702">Swarm populous , unnumbered as the sands</l>
     <l n="1703">Of Barca or Cyrene 's torrid soil ,</l>
     <l n="1704">Levied to side with warring winds , and poise</l>
     <l n="1705">Their lighter wings . To whom these most adhere</l>
     <l n="1706">He rules a moment : Chaos umpire sits ,</l>
     <l n="1707">And by decision more embroils the fray</l>
     <l n="1708">By which he reigns : next him , high arbiter ,</l>
     <l n="1709">Chance governs all . Into this wild Abyss ,</l>
     <l n="1710">The womb of Nature , and perhaps her grave ,</l>
     <l n="1711">Of neither sea , nor shore , nor air , nor fire ,</l>
     <l n="1712">But all these in their pregnant causes mixed</l>
     <l n="1713">Confusedly , and which thus must ever fight ,</l>
     <l n="1714">Unless th ’ Almighty Maker them ordain</l>
     <l n="1715">His dark materials to create more worlds —</l>
     <l n="1716">Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend</l>
     <l n="1717">Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while ,</l>
     <l n="1718">Pondering his voyage ; for no narrow frith</l>
     <l n="1719">He had to cross . Nor was his ear less pealed</l>
     <l n="1720">With noises loud and ruinous ( to compare</l>
     <l n="1721">Great things with small ) than when Bellona storms</l>
     <l n="1722">With all her battering engines , bent to rase</l>
     <l n="1723">Some capital city ; or less than if this frame</l>
     <l n="1724">Of Heaven were falling , and these elements</l>
     <l n="1725">In mutiny had from her axle torn</l>
     <l n="1726">The steadfast Earth . At last his sail-broad vans</l>
     <l n="1727">He spread for flight , and , in the surging smoke</l>
     <l n="1728">Uplifted , spurns the ground ; thence many a league ,</l>
     <l n="1729">As in a cloudy chair , ascending rides</l>
     <l n="1730">Audacious ; but , that seat soon failing , meets</l>
     <l n="1731">A vast vacuity . All unawares ,</l>
     <l n="1732">Fluttering his pennons vain , plumb-down he drops</l>
     <l n="1733">Ten thousand fathom deep , and to this hour</l>
     <l n="1734">Down had been falling , had not , by ill chance ,</l>
     <l n="1735">The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud ,</l>
     <l n="1736">Instinct with fire and nitre , hurried him</l>
     <l n="1737">As many miles aloft . That fury stayed —</l>
     <l n="1738">Quenched in a boggy Syrtis , neither sea ,</l>
     <l n="1739">Nor good dry land — nigh foundered , on he fares ,</l>
     <l n="1740">Treading the crude consistence , half on foot ,</l>
     <l n="1741">Half flying ; behoves him now both oar and sail .</l>
     <l n="1742">As when a gryphon through the wilderness</l>
     <l n="1743">With winged course , o'er hill or moory dale ,</l>
     <l n="1744">Pursues the Arimaspian , who by stealth</l>
     <l n="1745">Had from his wakeful custody purloined</l>
     <l n="1746">The guarded gold ; so eagerly the Fiend</l>
     <l n="1747">O'er bog or steep , through strait , rough , dense , or rare ,</l>
     <l n="1748">With head , hands , wings , or feet , pursues his way ,</l>
     <l n="1749">And swims , or sinks , or wades , or creeps , or flies .</l>
     <l n="1750">At length a universal hubbub wild</l>
     <l n="1751">Of stunning sounds , and voices all confused ,</l>
     <l n="1752">Borne through the hollow dark , assaults his ear</l>
     <l n="1753">With loudest vehemence . Thither he plies</l>
     <l n="1754">Undaunted , to meet there whatever Power</l>
     <l n="1755">Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss</l>
     <l n="1756">Might in that noise reside , of whom to ask</l>
     <l n="1757">Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies</l>
     <l n="1758">Bordering on light ; when straight behold the throne</l>
     <l n="1759">Of Chaos , and his dark pavilion spread</l>
     <l n="1760">Wide on the wasteful Deep ! With him enthroned</l>
     <l n="1761">Sat sable-vested Night , eldest of things ,</l>
     <l n="1762">The consort of his reign ; and by them stood</l>
     <l n="1763">Orcus and Ades , and the dreaded name</l>
     <l n="1764">Of Demogorgon ; Rumour next , and Chance ,</l>
     <l n="1765">And Tumult , and Confusion , all embroiled ,</l>
     <l n="1766">And Discord with a thousand various mouths .</l>
     <l n="1767">T ’ whom Satan , turning boldly , thus :— “ Ye Powers</l>
     <l n="1768">And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss ,</l>
     <l n="1769">Chaos and ancient Night , I come no spy</l>
     <l n="1770">With purpose to explore or to disturb</l>
     <l n="1771">The secrets of your realm ; but , by constraint</l>
     <l n="1772">Wandering this darksome desert , as my way</l>
     <l n="1773">Lies through your spacious empire up to light ,</l>
     <l n="1774">Alone and without guide , half lost , I seek ,</l>
     <l n="1775">What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds</l>
     <l n="1776">Confine with Heaven ; or , if some other place ,</l>
     <l n="1777">From your dominion won , th ’ Ethereal King</l>
     <l n="1778">Possesses lately , thither to arrive</l>
     <l n="1779">I travel this profound . Direct my course :</l>
     <l n="1780">Directed , no mean recompense it brings</l>
     <l n="1781">To your behoof , if I that region lost ,</l>
     <l n="1782">All usurpation thence expelled , reduce</l>
     <l n="1783">To her original darkness and your sway</l>
     <l n="1784">( Which is my present journey ) , and once more</l>
     <l n="1785">Erect the standard there of ancient Night .</l>
     <l n="1786">Yours be th ’ advantage all , mine the revenge ! ”</l>
     <l n="1787">Thus Satan ; and him thus the Anarch old ,</l>
     <l n="1788">With faltering speech and visage incomposed ,</l>
     <l n="1789">Answered : “ I know thee , stranger , who thou art —</l>
     <l n="1790">That mighty leading Angel , who of late</l>
     <l n="1791">Made head against Heaven 's King , though overthrown .</l>
     <l n="1792">I saw and heard ; for such a numerous host</l>
     <l n="1793">Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep ,</l>
     <l n="1794">With ruin upon ruin , rout on rout ,</l>
     <l n="1795">Confusion worse confounded ; and Heaven-gates</l>
     <l n="1796">Poured out by millions her victorious bands ,</l>
     <l n="1797">Pursuing . I upon my frontiers here</l>
     <l n="1798">Keep residence ; if all I can will serve</l>
     <l n="1799">That little which is left so to defend ,</l>
     <l n="1800">Encroached on still through our intestine broils</l>
     <l n="1801">Weakening the sceptre of old Night : first , Hell ,</l>
     <l n="1802">Your dungeon , stretching far and wide beneath ;</l>
     <l n="1803">Now lately Heaven and Earth , another world</l>
     <l n="1804">Hung o'er my realm , linked in a golden chain</l>
     <l n="1805">To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell !</l>
     <l n="1806">If that way be your walk , you have not far ;</l>
     <l n="1807">So much the nearer danger . Go , and speed ;</l>
     <l n="1808">Havoc , and spoil , and ruin , are my gain . ”</l>
     <l n="1809">He ceased ; and Satan stayed not to reply ,</l>
     <l n="1810">But , glad that now his sea should find a shore ,</l>
     <l n="1811">With fresh alacrity and force renewed</l>
     <l n="1812">Springs upward , like a pyramid of fire ,</l>
     <l n="1813">Into the wild expanse , and through the shock</l>
     <l n="1814">Of fighting elements , on all sides round</l>
     <l n="1815">Environed , wins his way ; harder beset</l>
     <l n="1816">And more endangered than when Argo passed</l>
     <l n="1817">Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks ,</l>
     <l n="1818">Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned</l>
     <l n="1819">Charybdis , and by th ’ other whirlpool steered .</l>
     <l n="1820">So he with difficulty and labour hard</l>
     <l n="1821">Moved on , with difficulty and labour he ;</l>
     <l n="1822">But , he once passed , soon after , when Man fell ,</l>
     <l n="1823">Strange alteration ! Sin and Death amain ,</l>
     <l n="1824">Following his track ( such was the will of Heaven )</l>
     <l n="1825">Paved after him a broad and beaten way</l>
     <l n="1826">Over the dark Abyss , whose boiling gulf</l>
     <l n="1827">Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length ,</l>
     <l n="1828">From Hell continued , reaching th ’ utmost orb</l>
     <l n="1829">Of this frail World ; by which the Spirits perverse</l>
     <l n="1830">With easy intercourse pass to and fro</l>
     <l n="1831">To tempt or punish mortals , except whom</l>
     <l n="1832">God and good Angels guard by special grace .</l>
     <l n="1833">But now at last the sacred influence</l>
     <l n="1834">Of light appears , and from the walls of Heaven</l>
     <l n="1835">Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night</l>
     <l n="1836">A glimmering dawn . Here Nature first begins</l>
     <l n="1837">Her farthest verge , and Chaos to retire ,</l>
     <l n="1838">As from her outmost works , a broken foe ,</l>
     <l n="1839">With tumult less and with less hostile din ;</l>
     <l n="1840">That Satan with less toil , and now with ease ,</l>
     <l n="1841">Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light ,</l>
     <l n="1842">And , like a weather-beaten vessel , holds</l>
     <l n="1843">Gladly the port , though shrouds and tackle torn ;</l>
     <l n="1844">Or in the emptier waste , resembling air ,</l>
     <l n="1845">Weighs his spread wings , at leisure to behold</l>
     <l n="1846">Far off th ’ empyreal Heaven , extended wide</l>
     <l n="1847">In circuit , undetermined square or round ,</l>
     <l n="1848">With opal towers and battlements adorned</l>
     <l n="1849">Of living sapphire , once his native seat ;</l>
     <l n="1850">And , fast by , hanging in a golden chain ,</l>
     <l n="1851">This pendent World , in bigness as a star</l>
     <l n="1852">Of smallest magnitude close by the moon .</l>
     <l n="1853">Thither , full fraught with mischievous revenge ,</l>
     <l n="1854">Accursed , and in a cursed hour , he hies .</l>

     <l n="1856">Hail , holy Light , offspring of Heaven firstborn ,</l>
     <l n="1857">Or of the Eternal coeternal beam</l>
     <l n="1858">May I express thee unblam 'd ? since God is light ,</l>
     <l n="1859">And never but in unapproached light</l>
     <l n="1860">Dwelt from eternity , dwelt then in thee</l>
     <l n="1861">Bright effluence of bright essence increate .</l>
     <l n="1862">Or hear'st thou rather pure ethereal stream ,</l>
     <l n="1863">Whose fountain who shall tell ? before the sun ,</l>
     <l n="1864">Before the Heavens thou wert , and at the voice</l>
     <l n="1865">Of God , as with a mantle , didst invest</l>
     <l n="1866">The rising world of waters dark and deep ,</l>
     <l n="1867">Won from the void and formless infinite .</l>

     <l n="1869">Escap 'd the Stygian pool , though long detain 'd</l>
     <l n="1870">In that obscure sojourn , while in my flight</l>
     <l n="1871">Through utter and through middle darkness borne ,</l>
     <l n="1872">With other notes than to the Orphean lyre</l>
     <l n="1873">I sung of Chaos and eternal Night ;</l>
     <l n="1874">Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down</l>
     <l n="1875">The dark descent , and up to re-ascend ,</l>
     <l n="1876">Though hard and rare : Thee I revisit safe ,</l>
     <l n="1877">And feel thy sovran vital lamp ; but thou</l>
     <l n="1878">Revisit'st not these eyes , that roll in vain</l>
     <l n="1879">To find thy piercing ray , and find no dawn ;</l>
     <l n="1880">So thick a drop serene hath quench 'd their orbs ,</l>
     <l n="1881">Or dim suffusion veil 'd . Yet not the more</l>
     <l n="1882">Cease I to wander , where the Muses haunt ,</l>
     <l n="1883">Clear spring , or shady grove , or sunny hill ,</l>
     <l n="1884">Smit with the love of sacred song ; but chief</l>
     <l n="1885">Thee , Sion , and the flowery brooks beneath ,</l>
     <l n="1886">That wash thy hallow 'd feet , and warbling flow ,</l>
     <l n="1887">Nightly I visit : nor sometimes forget</l>
     <l n="1888">So were I equall 'd with them in renown ,</l>
     <l n="1889">Thy sovran command , that Man should find grace ;</l>
     <l n="1890">Blind Thamyris , and blind Maeonides ,</l>
     <l n="1891">And Tiresias , and Phineus , prophets old :</l>
     <l n="1892">Then feed on thoughts , that voluntary move</l>

     <l n="1894">Sings darkling , and in shadiest covert hid</l>
     <l n="1895">Tunes her nocturnal note . Thus with the year</l>
     <l n="1896">Seasons return ; but not to me returns</l>
     <l n="1897">Day , or the sweet approach of even or morn ,</l>
     <l n="1898">Or sight of vernal bloom , or summer 's rose ,</l>
     <l n="1899">Or flocks , or herds , or human face divine ;</l>
     <l n="1900">But cloud instead , and ever-during dark</l>
     <l n="1901">Surrounds me , from the cheerful ways of men</l>
     <l n="1902">Cut off , and for the book of knowledge fair</l>
     <l n="1903">Presented with a universal blank</l>
     <l n="1904">Of nature 's works to me expung 'd and ras 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1905">And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out .</l>

     <l n="1908">Irradiate ; there plant eyes , all mist from thence</l>
     <l n="1909">Purge and disperse , that I may see and tell</l>
     <l n="1910">Of things invisible to mortal sight .</l>
     <l n="1911">Now had the Almighty Father from above ,</l>
     <l n="1912">From the pure empyrean where he sits</l>
     <l n="1913">High thron 'd above all highth , bent down his eye</l>

     <l n="1915">About him all the Sanctities of Heaven</l>
     <l n="1916">Stood thick as stars , and from his sight receiv 'd</l>
     <l n="1917">Beatitude past utterance ; on his right</l>

     <l n="1922">Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love ,</l>
     <l n="1923">Uninterrupted joy , unrivall 'd love ,</l>
     <l n="1924">In blissful solitude ; he then survey 'd</l>
     <l n="1925">Hell and the gulf between , and Satan there</l>
     <l n="1926">Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night</l>
     <l n="1927">In the dun air sublime , and ready now</l>
     <l n="1928">To stoop with wearied wings , and willing feet ,</l>
     <l n="1929">On the bare outside of this world , that seem 'd</l>
     <l n="1930">Firm land imbosom 'd , without firmament ,</l>
     <l n="1931">Uncertain which , in ocean or in air .</l>
     <l n="1932">Him God beholding from his prospect high ,</l>
     <l n="1933">Wherein past , present , future , he beholds ,</l>
     <l n="1934">Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake .</l>
     <l n="1935">Only begotten Son , seest thou what rage</l>
     <l n="1936">Transports our Adversary ? whom no bounds</l>
     <l n="1937">Prescrib 'd no bars of Hell , nor all the chains</l>
     <l n="1938">Heap 'd on him there , nor yet the main abyss</l>
     <l n="1939">Wide interrupt , can hold ; so bent he seems</l>
     <l n="1940">On desperate revenge , that shall redound</l>
     <l n="1941">Upon his own rebellious head . And now ,</l>
     <l n="1942">Through all restraint broke loose , he wings his way</l>
     <l n="1943">Not far off Heaven , in the precincts of light ,</l>
     <l n="1944">Directly towards the new created world ,</l>
     <l n="1945">And man there plac 'd , with purpose to assay</l>
     <l n="1946">If him by force he can destroy , or , worse ,</l>
     <l n="1947">By some false guile pervert ; and shall pervert ;</l>
     <l n="1948">For man will hearken to his glozing lies ,</l>
     <l n="1949">And easily transgress the sole command ,</l>
     <l n="1950">Sole pledge of his obedience : So will fall</l>
     <l n="1951">He and his faithless progeny : Whose fault ?</l>
     <l n="1952">Whose but his own ? ingrate , he had of me</l>
     <l n="1953">All he could have ; I made him just and right ,</l>
     <l n="1954">Sufficient to have stood , though free to fall .</l>
     <l n="1955">Such I created all the ethereal Powers</l>
     <l n="1956">And Spirits , both them who stood , and them who fail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="1957">Freely they stood who stood , and fell who fell .</l>
     <l n="1958">Not free , what proof could they have given sincere</l>
     <l n="1959">Of true allegiance , constant faith or love ,</l>
     <l n="1960">Where only what they needs must do appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1961">Not what they would ? what praise could they receive ?</l>
     <l n="1962">What pleasure I from such obedience paid ,</l>
     <l n="1963">When will and reason ( reason also is choice )</l>
     <l n="1964">Useless and vain , of freedom both despoil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1965">Made passive both , had serv 'd necessity ,</l>
     <l n="1966">Not me . They therefore , as to right belong 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1967">So were created , nor can justly accuse</l>
     <l n="1968">Their Maker , or their making , or their fate ,</l>
     <l n="1969">As if predestination over-rul 'd</l>
     <l n="1970">Their will dispos 'd by absolute decree</l>
     <l n="1971">Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed</l>
     <l n="1972">Their own revolt , not I ; if I foreknew ,</l>
     <l n="1973">Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault ,</l>
     <l n="1974">Which had no less proved certain unforeknown .</l>
     <l n="1975">So without least impulse or shadow of fate ,</l>
     <l n="1976">Or aught by me immutably foreseen ,</l>
     <l n="1977">They trespass , authors to themselves in all</l>
     <l n="1978">Both what they judge , and what they choose ; for so</l>
     <l n="1979">I form 'd them free : and free they must remain ,</l>
     <l n="1980">Till they enthrall themselves ; I else must change</l>
     <l n="1981">Their nature , and revoke the high decree</l>
     <l n="1982">Unchangeable , eternal , which ordain 'd</l>
     <l n="1983">Their freedom : they themselves ordain 'd their fall .</l>
     <l n="1984">The first sort by their own suggestion fell ,</l>
     <l n="1985">Self-tempted , self-deprav 'd : Man falls , deceiv 'd</l>
     <l n="1986">By the other first : Man therefore shall find grace ,</l>
     <l n="1987">The other none : In mercy and justice both ,</l>
     <l n="1988">Through Heaven and Earth , so shall my glory excel ;</l>
     <l n="1989">But Mercy , first and last , shall brightest shine .</l>
     <l n="1990">Thus while God spake , ambrosial fragrance fill 'd</l>
     <l n="1991">All Heaven , and in the blessed Spirits elect</l>
     <l n="1992">Sense of new joy ineffable diffus 'd .</l>
     <l n="1993">Beyond compare the Son of God was seen</l>
     <l n="1994">Most glorious ; in him all his Father shone</l>
     <l n="1995">Substantially express 'd ; and in his face</l>
     <l n="1996">Divine compassion visibly appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1997">Love without end , and without measure grace ,</l>
     <l n="1998">Which uttering , thus he to his Father spake .</l>
     <l n="1999">O Father , gracious was that word which clos 'd</l>
     <l n="2000">Thy sovran command , that Man should find grace ;</l>
     <l n="2001">For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol</l>
     <l n="2002">Thy praises , with the innumerable sound</l>
     <l n="2003">Of hymns and sacred songs , wherewith thy throne</l>
     <l n="2004">Encompass 'd shall resound thee ever blest .</l>
     <l n="2005">For should Man finally be lost , should Man ,</l>
     <l n="2006">Thy creature late so lov 'd , thy youngest son ,</l>
     <l n="2007">Fall circumvented thus by fraud , though join 'd</l>
     <l n="2008">With his own folly ? that be from thee far ,</l>
     <l n="2009">That far be from thee , Father , who art judge</l>
     <l n="2010">Of all things made , and judgest only right .</l>
     <l n="2011">Or shall the Adversary thus obtain</l>
     <l n="2012">His end , and frustrate thine ? shall he fulfill</l>
     <l n="2013">His malice , and thy goodness bring to nought ,</l>
     <l n="2014">Or proud return , though to his heavier doom ,</l>
     <l n="2015">Yet with revenge accomplish 'd , and to Hell</l>
     <l n="2016">Draw after him the whole race of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="2017">By him corrupted ? or wilt thou thyself</l>
     <l n="2018">Abolish thy creation , and unmake</l>
     <l n="2019">For him , what for thy glory thou hast made ?</l>
     <l n="2020">So should thy goodness and thy greatness both</l>
     <l n="2021">Be question 'd and blasphem 'd without defence .</l>
     <l n="2022">To whom the great Creator thus replied .</l>
     <l n="2023">O son , in whom my soul hath chief delight ,</l>
     <l n="2024">Son of my bosom , Son who art alone .</l>
     <l n="2025">My word , my wisdom , and effectual might ,</l>
     <l n="2026">All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are , all</l>
     <l n="2027">As my eternal purpose hath decreed ;</l>
     <l n="2028">Man shall not quite be lost , but sav 'd who will ;</l>
     <l n="2029">Yet not of will in him , but grace in me</l>
     <l n="2030">Freely vouchsaf 'd ; once more I will renew</l>
     <l n="2031">His lapsed powers , though forfeit ; and enthrall 'd</l>
     <l n="2032">By sin to foul exorbitant desires ;</l>
     <l n="2033">Upheld by me , yet once more he shall stand</l>
     <l n="2034">On even ground against his mortal foe ;</l>
     <l n="2035">By me upheld , that he may know how frail</l>
     <l n="2036">His fallen condition is , and to me owe</l>
     <l n="2037">All his deliverance , and to none but me .</l>
     <l n="2038">Some I have chosen of peculiar grace ,</l>
     <l n="2039">Elect above the rest ; so is my will :</l>
     <l n="2040">The rest shall hear me call , and oft be warn 'd</l>
     <l n="2041">Their sinful state , and to appease betimes</l>
     <l n="2042">The incensed Deity , while offer 'd grace</l>
     <l n="2043">Invites ; for I will clear their senses dark ,</l>
     <l n="2044">What may suffice , and soften stony hearts</l>
     <l n="2045">To pray , repent , and bring obedience due .</l>
     <l n="2046">To prayer , repentance , and obedience due ,</l>
     <l n="2047">Though but endeavour 'd with sincere intent ,</l>
     <l n="2048">Mine ear shall not be slow , mine eye not shut .</l>
     <l n="2049">And I will place within them as a guide ,</l>
     <l n="2050">My umpire Conscience ; whom if they will hear ,</l>
     <l n="2051">Light after light , well us 'd , they shall attain ,</l>
     <l n="2052">And to the end , persisting , safe arrive .</l>
     <l n="2053">This my long sufferance , and my day of grace ,</l>
     <l n="2054">They who neglect and scorn , shall never taste ;</l>
     <l n="2055">But hard be harden 'd , blind be blinded more ,</l>
     <l n="2056">That they may stumble on , and deeper fall ;</l>
     <l n="2057">And none but such from mercy I exclude .</l>
     <l n="2058">But yet all is not done ; Man disobeying ,</l>
     <l n="2059">Disloyal , breaks his fealty , and sins</l>
     <l n="2060">Against the high supremacy of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="2061">Affecting God-head , and , so losing all ,</l>
     <l n="2062">To expiate his treason hath nought left ,</l>
     <l n="2063">But to destruction sacred and devote ,</l>
     <l n="2064">He , with his whole posterity , must die ,</l>
     <l n="2065">Die he or justice must ; unless for him</l>
     <l n="2066">Some other able , and as willing , pay</l>
     <l n="2067">The rigid satisfaction , death for death .</l>
     <l n="2068">Say , heavenly Powers , where shall we find such love ?</l>
     <l n="2069">Which of you will be mortal , to redeem</l>
     <l n="2070">Man 's mortal crime , and just the unjust to save ?</l>
     <l n="2071">Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear ?</l>
     <l n="2072">He ask 'd , but all the heavenly quire stood mute ,</l>
     <l n="2073">And silence was in Heaven : on Man 's behalf</l>
     <l n="2074">Patron or intercessour none appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="2075">Much less that durst upon his own head draw</l>
     <l n="2076">The deadly forfeiture , and ransom set .</l>
     <l n="2077">And now without redemption all mankind</l>
     <l n="2078">Must have been lost , adjudg 'd to Death and Hell</l>
     <l n="2079">By doom severe , had not the Son of God ,</l>
     <l n="2080">In whom the fulness dwells of love divine ,</l>
     <l n="2081">His dearest mediation thus renew 'd .</l>
     <l n="2082">Father , thy word is past , Man shall find grace ;</l>
     <l n="2083">And shall grace not find means , that finds her way ,</l>
     <l n="2084">The speediest of thy winged messengers ,</l>
     <l n="2085">To visit all thy creatures , and to all</l>
     <l n="2086">Comes unprevented , unimplor 'd , unsought ?</l>
     <l n="2087">Happy for Man , so coming ; he her aid</l>
     <l n="2088">Can never seek , once dead in sins , and lost ;</l>
     <l n="2089">Atonement for himself , or offering meet ,</l>
     <l n="2090">Indebted and undone , hath none to bring ;</l>
     <l n="2091">Behold me then : me for him , life for life</l>
     <l n="2092">I offer : on me let thine anger fall ;</l>
     <l n="2093">Account me Man ; I for his sake will leave</l>
     <l n="2094">Thy bosom , and this glory next to thee</l>
     <l n="2095">Freely put off , and for him lastly die</l>
     <l n="2096">Well pleased ; on me let Death wreak all his rage .</l>
     <l n="2097">Under his gloomy power I shall not long</l>
     <l n="2098">Lie vanquished . Thou hast given me to possess</l>
     <l n="2099">Life in myself for ever ; by thee I live ;</l>
     <l n="2100">Though now to Death I yield , and am his due ,</l>
     <l n="2101">All that of me can die , yet , that debt paid ,</l>
     <l n="2102">Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave</l>
     <l n="2103">His prey , nor suffer my unspotted soul</l>
     <l n="2104">For ever with corruption there to dwell ;</l>
     <l n="2105">But I shall rise victorious , and subdue</l>
     <l n="2106">My vanquisher , spoiled of his vaunted spoil .</l>
     <l n="2107">Death his death 's wound shall then receive , and stoop</l>
     <l n="2108">Inglorious , of his mortal sting disarmed ;</l>
     <l n="2109">I through the ample air in triumph high</l>
     <l n="2110">Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell , and show</l>
     <l n="2111">The powers of darkness bound . Thou , at the sight</l>
     <l n="2112">Pleased , out of Heaven shalt look down and smile ,</l>
     <l n="2113">While , by thee raised , I ruin all my foes ;</l>
     <l n="2114">Death last , and with his carcase glut the grave ;</l>
     <l n="2115">Then , with the multitude of my redeemed ,</l>
     <l n="2116">Shall enter Heaven , long absent , and return ,</l>
     <l n="2117">Father , to see thy face , wherein no cloud</l>
     <l n="2118">Of anger shall remain , but peace assured</l>
     <l n="2119">And reconcilement : wrath shall be no more</l>
     <l n="2120">Thenceforth , but in thy presence joy entire .</l>
     <l n="2121">His words here ended ; but his meek aspect</l>
     <l n="2122">Silent yet spake , and breathed immortal love</l>
     <l n="2123">To mortal men , above which only shone</l>
     <l n="2124">Filial obedience : as a sacrifice</l>
     <l n="2125">Glad to be offered , he attends the will</l>
     <l n="2126">Of his great Father . Admiration seized</l>
     <l n="2127">All Heaven , what this might mean , and whither tend ,</l>
     <l n="2128">Wondering ; but soon th ’ Almighty thus replied :</l>
     <l n="2129">O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace</l>
     <l n="2130">Found out for mankind under wrath , O thou</l>
     <l n="2131">My sole complacence ! Well thou know'st how dear</l>
     <l n="2132">To me are all my works ; nor Man the least ,</l>
     <l n="2133">Though last created , that for him I spare</l>
     <l n="2134">Thee from my bosom and right hand , to save ,</l>
     <l n="2135">By losing thee a while , the whole race lost .</l>
     <l n="2136">Thou , therefore , whom thou only canst redeem ,</l>
     <l n="2137">Their nature also to thy nature join ;</l>
     <l n="2138">And be thyself Man among men on Earth ,</l>
     <l n="2139">Made flesh , when time shall be , of virgin seed ,</l>
     <l n="2140">By wondrous birth ; be thou in Adam 's room</l>
     <l n="2141">The head of all mankind , though Adam 's son .</l>
     <l n="2142">As in him perish all men , so in thee ,</l>
     <l n="2143">As from a second root , shall be restored</l>
     <l n="2144">As many as are restored , without thee none .</l>
     <l n="2145">His crime makes guilty all his sons ; thy merit ,</l>
     <l n="2146">Imputed , shall absolve them who renounce</l>
     <l n="2147">Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds ,</l>
     <l n="2148">And live in thee transplanted , and from thee</l>
     <l n="2149">Receive new life . So Man , as is most just ,</l>
     <l n="2150">Shall satisfy for Man , be judged and die ,</l>
     <l n="2151">And dying rise , and rising with him raise</l>
     <l n="2152">His brethren , ransomed with his own dear life .</l>
     <l n="2153">So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate ,</l>
     <l n="2154">Giving to death , and dying to redeem ,</l>
     <l n="2155">So dearly to redeem what hellish hate</l>
     <l n="2156">So easily destroyed , and still destroys</l>
     <l n="2157">In those who , when they may , accept not grace .</l>
     <l n="2158">Nor shalt thou , by descending to assume</l>
     <l n="2159">Man 's nature , lessen or degrade thine own .</l>
     <l n="2160">Because thou hast , though throned in highest bliss</l>
     <l n="2161">Equal to God , and equally enjoying</l>
     <l n="2162">God-like fruition , quitted all , to save</l>
     <l n="2163">A world from utter loss , and hast been found</l>
     <l n="2164">By merit more than birthright Son of God ,</l>
     <l n="2165">Found worthiest to be so by being good ,</l>
     <l n="2166">Far more than great or high ; because in thee</l>
     <l n="2167">Love hath abounded more than glory abounds ;</l>
     <l n="2168">Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt</l>
     <l n="2169">With thee thy manhood also to this throne :</l>
     <l n="2170">Here shalt thou sit incarnate , here shalt reign</l>
     <l n="2171">Both God and Man , Son both of God and Man ,</l>
     <l n="2172">Anointed universal King ; all power</l>
     <l n="2173">I give thee ; reign for ever , and assume</l>
     <l n="2174">Thy merits ; under thee , as head supreme ,</l>
     <l n="2175">Thrones , Princedoms , Powers , Dominions , I reduce :</l>
     <l n="2176">All knees to thee shall bow , of them that bide</l>
     <l n="2177">In Heaven , or Earth , or under Earth in Hell .</l>
     <l n="2178">When thou , attended gloriously from Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="2179">Shalt in the sky appear , and from thee send</l>
     <l n="2180">The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim</l>
     <l n="2181">Thy dread tribunal ; forthwith from all winds ,</l>
     <l n="2182">The living , and forthwith the cited dead</l>
     <l n="2183">Of all past ages , to the general doom</l>
     <l n="2184">Shall hasten ; such a peal shall rouse their sleep .</l>
     <l n="2185">Then , all thy saints assembled , thou shalt judge</l>
     <l n="2186">Bad Men and Angels ; they , arraigned , shall sink</l>
     <l n="2187">Beneath thy sentence ; Hell , her numbers full ,</l>
     <l n="2188">Thenceforth shall be for ever shut . Mean while</l>
     <l n="2189">The world shall burn , and from her ashes spring</l>
     <l n="2190">New Heaven and Earth , wherein the just shall dwell ,</l>
     <l n="2191">And , after all their tribulations long ,</l>
     <l n="2192">See golden days , fruitful of golden deeds ,</l>
     <l n="2193">With joy and peace triumphing , and fair truth .</l>
     <l n="2194">Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by ,</l>
     <l n="2195">For regal scepter then no more shall need ,</l>
     <l n="2196">God shall be all in all . But , all ye Gods ,</l>
     <l n="2197">Adore him , who to compass all this dies ;</l>
     <l n="2198">Adore the Son , and honour him as me .</l>
     <l n="2199">No sooner had the Almighty ceased , but all</l>
     <l n="2200">The multitude of Angels , with a shout</l>
     <l n="2201">Loud as from numbers without number , sweet</l>
     <l n="2202">As from blest voices , uttering joy , Heaven rung</l>
     <l n="2203">With jubilee , and loud Hosannas filled</l>
     <l n="2204">The eternal regions : Lowly reverent</l>
     <l n="2205">Towards either throne they bow , and to the ground</l>
     <l n="2206">With solemn adoration down they cast</l>
     <l n="2207">Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold ;</l>
     <l n="2208">Immortal amarant , a flower which once</l>
     <l n="2209">In Paradise , fast by the tree of life ,</l>
     <l n="2210">Began to bloom ; but soon for man 's offence</l>
     <l n="2211">To Heaven removed , where first it grew , there grows ,</l>
     <l n="2212">And flowers aloft shading the fount of life ,</l>
     <l n="2213">And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven</l>
     <l n="2214">Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream ;</l>
     <l n="2215">With these that never fade the Spirits elect</l>
     <l n="2216">Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams ;</l>
     <l n="2217">Now in loose garlands thick thrown off , the bright</l>
     <l n="2218">Pavement , that like a sea of jasper shone ,</l>
     <l n="2219">Impurpled with celestial roses smiled .</l>
     <l n="2220">Then , crowned again , their golden harps they took ,</l>
     <l n="2221">Harps ever tuned , that glittering by their side</l>
     <l n="2222">Like quivers hung , and with preamble sweet</l>
     <l n="2223">Of charming symphony they introduce</l>
     <l n="2224">Their sacred song , and waken raptures high ;</l>
     <l n="2225">No voice exempt , no voice but well could join</l>
     <l n="2226">Melodious part , such concord is in Heaven .</l>
     <l n="2227">Thee , Father , first they sung Omnipotent ,</l>
     <l n="2228">Immutable , Immortal , Infinite ,</l>
     <l n="2229">Eternal King ; the Author of all being ,</l>
     <l n="2230">Fountain of light , thyself invisible</l>
     <l n="2231">Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st</l>
     <l n="2232">Throned inaccessible , but when thou shadest</l>
     <l n="2233">The full blaze of thy beams , and , through a cloud</l>
     <l n="2234">Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine ,</l>
     <l n="2235">Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear ,</l>
     <l n="2236">Yet dazzle Heaven , that brightest Seraphim</l>
     <l n="2237">Approach not , but with both wings veil their eyes .</l>
     <l n="2238">Thee next they sang of all creation first ,</l>
     <l n="2239">Begotten Son , Divine Similitude ,</l>
     <l n="2240">In whose conspicuous countenance , without cloud</l>
     <l n="2241">Made visible , the Almighty Father shines ,</l>
     <l n="2242">Whom else no creature can behold ; on thee</l>
     <l n="2243">Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides ,</l>
     <l n="2244">Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests .</l>
     <l n="2245">He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein</l>
     <l n="2246">By thee created ; and by thee threw down</l>
     <l n="2247">The aspiring Dominations : Thou that day</l>
     <l n="2248">Thy Father 's dreadful thunder didst not spare ,</l>
     <l n="2249">Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels , that shook</l>
     <l n="2250">Heaven 's everlasting frame , while o'er the necks</l>
     <l n="2251">Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed .</l>
     <l n="2252">Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim</l>
     <l n="2253">Thee only extolled , Son of thy Father 's might ,</l>
     <l n="2254">To execute fierce vengeance on his foes ,</l>
     <l n="2255">Not so on Man : Him through their malice fallen ,</l>
     <l n="2256">Father of mercy and grace , thou didst not doom</l>
     <l n="2257">So strictly , but much more to pity incline :</l>
     <l n="2258">No sooner did thy dear and only Son</l>
     <l n="2259">Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man</l>
     <l n="2260">So strictly , but much more to pity inclined ,</l>
     <l n="2261">He to appease thy wrath , and end the strife</l>
     <l n="2262">Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned ,</l>
     <l n="2263">Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat</l>
     <l n="2264">Second to thee , offered himself to die</l>
     <l n="2265">For Man 's offence . O unexampled love ,</l>
     <l n="2266">Love no where to be found less than Divine !</l>
     <l n="2267">Hail , Son of God , Saviour of Men ! Thy name</l>
     <l n="2268">Shall be the copious matter of my song</l>
     <l n="2269">Henceforth , and never shall my heart thy praise</l>
     <l n="2270">Forget , nor from thy Father 's praise disjoin .</l>
     <l n="2271">Thus they in Heaven , above the starry sphere ,</l>
     <l n="2272">Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent .</l>
     <l n="2273">Mean while upon the firm opacous globe</l>
     <l n="2274">Of this round world , whose first convex divides</l>
     <l n="2275">The luminous inferiour orbs , enclosed</l>
     <l n="2276">From Chaos , and the inroad of Darkness old ,</l>
     <l n="2277">Satan alighted walks : A globe far off</l>
     <l n="2278">It seemed , now seems a boundless continent</l>
     <l n="2279">Dark , waste , and wild , under the frown of Night</l>
     <l n="2280">Starless exposed , and ever-threatening storms</l>
     <l n="2281">Of Chaos blustering round , inclement sky ;</l>
     <l n="2282">Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="2283">Though distant far , some small reflection gains</l>
     <l n="2284">Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud :</l>
     <l n="2285">Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field .</l>
     <l n="2286">As when a vultur on Imaus bred ,</l>
     <l n="2287">Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds ,</l>
     <l n="2288">Dislodging from a region scarce of prey</l>
     <l n="2289">To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids ,</l>
     <l n="2290">On hills where flocks are fed , flies toward the springs</l>
     <l n="2291">Of Ganges or Hydaspes , Indian streams ;</l>
     <l n="2292">But in his way lights on the barren plains</l>
     <l n="2293">Of Sericana , where Chineses drive</l>
     <l n="2294">With sails and wind their cany waggons light :</l>
     <l n="2295">So , on this windy sea of land , the Fiend</l>
     <l n="2296">Walked up and down alone , bent on his prey ;</l>
     <l n="2297">Alone , for other creature in this place ,</l>
     <l n="2298">Living or lifeless , to be found was none ;</l>
     <l n="2299">None yet , but store hereafter from the earth</l>
     <l n="2300">Up hither like aereal vapours flew</l>
     <l n="2301">Of all things transitory and vain , when sin</l>
     <l n="2302">With vanity had filled the works of men :</l>
     <l n="2303">Both all things vain , and all who in vain things</l>
     <l n="2304">Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame ,</l>
     <l n="2305">Or happiness in this or the other life ;</l>
     <l n="2306">All who have their reward on earth , the fruits</l>
     <l n="2307">Of painful superstition and blind zeal ,</l>
     <l n="2308">Nought seeking but the praise of men , here find</l>
     <l n="2309">Fit retribution , empty as their deeds ;</l>
     <l n="2310">All the unaccomplished works of Nature 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="2311">Abortive , monstrous , or unkindly mixed ,</l>
     <l n="2312">Dissolved on earth , fleet hither , and in vain ,</l>
     <l n="2313">Till final dissolution , wander here ;</l>
     <l n="2314">Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed ;</l>
     <l n="2315">Those argent fields more likely habitants ,</l>
     <l n="2316">Translated Saints , or middle Spirits hold</l>
     <l n="2317">Betwixt the angelical and human kind .</l>
     <l n="2318">Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born</l>
     <l n="2319">First from the ancient world those giants came</l>
     <l n="2320">With many a vain exploit , though then renowned :</l>
     <l n="2321">The builders next of Babel on the plain</l>
     <l n="2322">Of Sennaar , and still with vain design ,</l>
     <l n="2323">New Babels , had they wherewithal , would build :</l>
     <l n="2324">Others came single ; he , who , to be deemed</l>
     <l n="2325">A God , leaped fondly into Aetna flames ,</l>
     <l n="2326">Empedocles ; and he , who , to enjoy</l>
     <l n="2327">Plato 's Elysium , leaped into the sea ,</l>
     <l n="2328">Cleombrotus ; and many more too long ,</l>
     <l n="2329">Embryos , and idiots , eremites , and friars</l>
     <l n="2330">White , black , and gray , with all their trumpery .</l>
     <l n="2331">Here pilgrims roam , that strayed so far to seek</l>
     <l n="2332">In Golgotha him dead , who lives in Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="2333">And they , who to be sure of Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="2334">Dying , put on the weeds of Dominick ,</l>
     <l n="2335">Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised ;</l>
     <l n="2336">They pass the planets seven , and pass the fixed ,</l>
     <l n="2337">And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs</l>
     <l n="2338">The trepidation talked , and that first moved ;</l>
     <l n="2339">And now Saint Peter at Heaven 's wicket seems</l>
     <l n="2340">To wait them with his keys , and now at foot</l>
     <l n="2341">Of Heaven 's ascent they lift their feet , when lo</l>
     <l n="2342">A violent cross wind from either coast</l>
     <l n="2343">Blows them transverse , ten thousand leagues awry</l>
     <l n="2344">Into the devious air : Then might ye see</l>
     <l n="2345">Cowls , hoods , and habits , with their wearers , tost</l>
     <l n="2346">And fluttered into rags ; then reliques , beads ,</l>
     <l n="2347">Indulgences , dispenses , pardons , bulls ,</l>
     <l n="2348">The sport of winds : All these , upwhirled aloft ,</l>
     <l n="2349">Fly o'er the backside of the world far off</l>
     <l n="2350">Into a Limbo large and broad , since called</l>
     <l n="2351">The Paradise of Fools , to few unknown</l>
     <l n="2352">Long after ; now unpeopled , and untrod .</l>
     <l n="2353">All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed ,</l>
     <l n="2354">And long he wandered , till at last a gleam</l>
     <l n="2355">Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste</l>
     <l n="2356">His travelled steps : far distant he descries</l>
     <l n="2357">Ascending by degrees magnificent</l>
     <l n="2358">Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high ;</l>
     <l n="2359">At top whereof , but far more rich , appeared</l>
     <l n="2360">The work as of a kingly palace-gate ,</l>
     <l n="2361">With frontispiece of diamond and gold</l>
     <l n="2362">Embellished ; thick with sparkling orient gems</l>
     <l n="2363">The portal shone , inimitable on earth</l>
     <l n="2364">By model , or by shading pencil , drawn .</l>
     <l n="2365">These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw</l>
     <l n="2366">Angels ascending and descending , bands</l>
     <l n="2367">Of guardians bright , when he from Esau fled</l>
     <l n="2368">To Padan-Aram , in the field of Luz</l>
     <l n="2369">Dreaming by night under the open sky</l>
     <l n="2370">And waking cried , This is the gate of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="2371">Each stair mysteriously was meant , nor stood</l>
     <l n="2372">There always , but drawn up to Heaven sometimes</l>
     <l n="2373">Viewless ; and underneath a bright sea flowed</l>
     <l n="2374">Of jasper , or of liquid pearl , whereon</l>
     <l n="2375">Who after came from earth , failing arrived</l>
     <l n="2376">Wafted by Angels , or flew o'er the lake</l>
     <l n="2377">Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds .</l>
     <l n="2378">The stairs were then let down , whether to dare</l>
     <l n="2379">The Fiend by easy ascent , or aggravate</l>
     <l n="2380">His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss :</l>
     <l n="2381">Direct against which opened from beneath ,</l>
     <l n="2382">Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="2383">A passage down to the Earth , a passage wide ,</l>
     <l n="2384">Wider by far than that of after-times</l>
     <l n="2385">Over mount Sion , and , though that were large ,</l>
     <l n="2386">Over the Promised Land to God so dear ;</l>
     <l n="2387">By which , to visit oft those happy tribes ,</l>
     <l n="2388">On high behests his angels to and fro</l>
     <l n="2389">Passed frequent , and his eye with choice regard</l>
     <l n="2390">From Paneas , the fount of Jordan 's flood ,</l>
     <l n="2391">To Beersaba , where the Holy Land</l>
     <l n="2392">Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore ;</l>
     <l n="2393">So wide the opening seemed , where bounds were set</l>
     <l n="2394">To darkness , such as bound the ocean wave .</l>
     <l n="2395">Satan from hence , now on the lower stair ,</l>
     <l n="2396">That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate ,</l>
     <l n="2397">Looks down with wonder at the sudden view</l>
     <l n="2398">Of all this world at once . As when a scout ,</l>
     <l n="2399">Through dark and desert ways with peril gone</l>
     <l n="2400">All night ; at last by break of cheerful dawn</l>
     <l n="2401">Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill ,</l>
     <l n="2402">Which to his eye discovers unaware</l>
     <l n="2403">The goodly prospect of some foreign land</l>
     <l n="2404">First seen , or some renowned metropolis</l>
     <l n="2405">With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned ,</l>
     <l n="2406">Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams :</l>
     <l n="2407">Such wonder seised , though after Heaven seen ,</l>
     <l n="2408">The Spirit malign , but much more envy seised ,</l>
     <l n="2409">At sight of all this world beheld so fair .</l>
     <l n="2410">Round he surveys ( and well might , where he stood</l>
     <l n="2411">So high above the circling canopy</l>
     <l n="2412">Of night 's extended shade ,) from eastern point</l>
     <l n="2413">Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears</l>
     <l n="2414">Andromeda far off Atlantick seas</l>
     <l n="2415">Beyond the horizon ; then from pole to pole</l>
     <l n="2416">He views in breadth , and without longer pause</l>
     <l n="2417">Down right into the world 's first region throws</l>
     <l n="2418">His flight precipitant , and winds with ease</l>
     <l n="2419">Through the pure marble air his oblique way</l>
     <l n="2420">Amongst innumerable stars , that shone</l>
     <l n="2421">Stars distant , but nigh hand seemed other worlds ;</l>
     <l n="2422">Or other worlds they seemed , or happy isles ,</l>
     <l n="2423">Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old ,</l>
     <l n="2424">Fortunate fields , and groves , and flowery vales ,</l>
     <l n="2425">Thrice happy isles ; but who dwelt happy there</l>
     <l n="2426">He staid not to inquire : Above them all</l>
     <l n="2427">The golden sun , in splendour likest Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="2428">Allured his eye ; thither his course he bends</l>
     <l n="2429">Through the calm firmament , ( but up or down ,</l>
     <l n="2430">By center , or eccentrick , hard to tell ,</l>
     <l n="2431">Or longitude ,) where the great luminary</l>
     <l n="2432">Aloof the vulgar constellations thick ,</l>
     <l n="2433">That from his lordly eye keep distance due ,</l>
     <l n="2434">Dispenses light from far ; they , as they move</l>
     <l n="2435">Their starry dance in numbers that compute</l>
     <l n="2436">Days , months , and years , towards his all-cheering lamp</l>
     <l n="2437">Turn swift their various motions , or are turned</l>
     <l n="2438">By his magnetick beam , that gently warms</l>
     <l n="2439">The universe , and to each inward part</l>
     <l n="2440">With gentle penetration , though unseen ,</l>
     <l n="2441">Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep ;</l>
     <l n="2442">So wonderously was set his station bright .</l>
     <l n="2443">There lands the Fiend , a spot like which perhaps</l>
     <l n="2444">Astronomer in the sun 's lucent orb</l>
     <l n="2445">Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw .</l>
     <l n="2446">The place he found beyond expression bright ,</l>
     <l n="2447">Compared with aught on earth , metal or stone ;</l>
     <l n="2448">Not all parts like , but all alike informed</l>
     <l n="2449">With radiant light , as glowing iron with fire ;</l>
     <l n="2450">If metal , part seemed gold , part silver clear ;</l>
     <l n="2451">If stone , carbuncle most or chrysolite ,</l>
     <l n="2452">Ruby or topaz , to the twelve that shone</l>
     <l n="2453">In Aaron 's breast-plate , and a stone besides</l>
     <l n="2454">Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen ,</l>
     <l n="2455">That stone , or like to that which here below</l>
     <l n="2456">Philosophers in vain so long have sought ,</l>
     <l n="2457">In vain , though by their powerful art they bind</l>
     <l n="2458">Volatile Hermes , and call up unbound</l>
     <l n="2459">In various shapes old Proteus from the sea ,</l>
     <l n="2460">Drained through a limbeck to his native form .</l>
     <l n="2461">What wonder then if fields and regions here</l>
     <l n="2462">Breathe forth Elixir pure , and rivers run</l>
     <l n="2463">Potable gold , when with one virtuous touch</l>
     <l n="2464">The arch-chemick sun , so far from us remote ,</l>
     <l n="2465">Produces , with terrestrial humour mixed ,</l>
     <l n="2466">Here in the dark so many precious things</l>
     <l n="2467">Of colour glorious , and effect so rare ?</l>
     <l n="2468">Here matter new to gaze the Devil met</l>
     <l n="2469">Undazzled ; far and wide his eye commands ;</l>
     <l n="2470">For sight no obstacle found here , nor shade ,</l>
     <l n="2471">But all sun-shine , as when his beams at noon</l>
     <l n="2472">Culminate from the equator , as they now</l>
     <l n="2473">Shot upward still direct , whence no way round</l>
     <l n="2474">Shadow from body opaque can fall ; and the air ,</l>
     <l n="2475">No where so clear , sharpened his visual ray</l>
     <l n="2476">To objects distant far , whereby he soon</l>
     <l n="2477">Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand ,</l>
     <l n="2478">The same whom John saw also in the sun :</l>
     <l n="2479">His back was turned , but not his brightness hid ;</l>
     <l n="2480">Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar</l>
     <l n="2481">Circled his head , nor less his locks behind</l>
     <l n="2482">Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings</l>
     <l n="2483">Lay waving round ; on some great charge employed</l>
     <l n="2484">He seemed , or fixed in cogitation deep .</l>
     <l n="2485">Glad was the Spirit impure , as now in hope</l>
     <l n="2486">To find who might direct his wandering flight</l>
     <l n="2487">To Paradise , the happy seat of Man ,</l>
     <l n="2488">His journey 's end and our beginning woe .</l>
     <l n="2489">But first he casts to change his proper shape ,</l>
     <l n="2490">Which else might work him danger or delay :</l>
     <l n="2491">And now a stripling Cherub he appears ,</l>
     <l n="2492">Not of the prime , yet such as in his face</l>
     <l n="2493">Youth smiled celestial , and to every limb</l>
     <l n="2494">Suitable grace diffused , so well he feigned :</l>
     <l n="2495">Under a coronet his flowing hair</l>
     <l n="2496">In curls on either cheek played ; wings he wore</l>
     <l n="2497">Of many a coloured plume , sprinkled with gold ;</l>
     <l n="2498">His habit fit for speed succinct , and held</l>
     <l n="2499">Before his decent steps a silver wand .</l>
     <l n="2500">He drew not nigh unheard ; the Angel bright ,</l>
     <l n="2501">Ere he drew nigh , his radiant visage turned ,</l>
     <l n="2502">Admonished by his ear , and straight was known</l>
     <l n="2503">The Arch-Angel Uriel , one of the seven</l>
     <l n="2504">Who in God 's presence , nearest to his throne ,</l>
     <l n="2505">Stand ready at command , and are his eyes</l>
     <l n="2506">That run through all the Heavens , or down to the Earth</l>
     <l n="2507">Bear his swift errands over moist and dry ,</l>
     <l n="2508">O'er sea and land : him Satan thus accosts .</l>
     <l n="2509">Uriel , for thou of those seven Spirits that stand</l>
     <l n="2510">In sight of God 's high throne , gloriously bright ,</l>
     <l n="2511">The first art wont his great authentick will</l>
     <l n="2512">Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring ,</l>
     <l n="2513">Where all his sons thy embassy attend ;</l>
     <l n="2514">And here art likeliest by supreme decree</l>
     <l n="2515">Like honour to obtain , and as his eye</l>
     <l n="2516">To visit oft this new creation round ;</l>
     <l n="2517">Unspeakable desire to see , and know</l>
     <l n="2518">All these his wonderous works , but chiefly Man ,</l>
     <l n="2519">His chief delight and favour , him for whom</l>
     <l n="2520">All these his works so wonderous he ordained ,</l>
     <l n="2521">Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim</l>
     <l n="2522">Alone thus wandering . Brightest Seraph , tell</l>
     <l n="2523">In which of all these shining orbs hath Man</l>
     <l n="2524">His fixed seat , or fixed seat hath none ,</l>
     <l n="2525">But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell ;</l>
     <l n="2526">That I may find him , and with secret gaze</l>
     <l n="2527">Or open admiration him behold ,</l>
     <l n="2528">On whom the great Creator hath bestowed</l>
     <l n="2529">Worlds , and on whom hath all these graces poured ;</l>
     <l n="2530">That both in him and all things , as is meet ,</l>
     <l n="2531">The universal Maker we may praise ;</l>
     <l n="2532">Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes</l>
     <l n="2533">To deepest Hell , and , to repair that loss ,</l>
     <l n="2534">Created this new happy race of Men</l>
     <l n="2535">To serve him better : Wise are all his ways .</l>
     <l n="2536">So spake the false dissembler unperceived ;</l>
     <l n="2537">For neither Man nor Angel can discern</l>
     <l n="2538">Hypocrisy , the only evil that walks</l>
     <l n="2539">Invisible , except to God alone ,</l>
     <l n="2540">By his permissive will , through Heaven and Earth :</l>
     <l n="2541">And oft , though wisdom wake , suspicion sleeps</l>
     <l n="2542">At wisdom 's gate , and to simplicity</l>
     <l n="2543">Resigns her charge , while goodness thinks no ill</l>
     <l n="2544">Where no ill seems : Which now for once beguiled</l>
     <l n="2545">Uriel , though regent of the sun , and held</l>
     <l n="2546">The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="2547">Who to the fraudulent impostor foul ,</l>
     <l n="2548">In his uprightness , answer thus returned .</l>
     <l n="2549">Fair Angel , thy desire , which tends to know</l>
     <l n="2550">The works of God , thereby to glorify</l>
     <l n="2551">The great Work-master , leads to no excess</l>
     <l n="2552">That reaches blame , but rather merits praise</l>
     <l n="2553">The more it seems excess , that led thee hither</l>
     <l n="2554">From thy empyreal mansion thus alone ,</l>
     <l n="2555">To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="2556">Contented with report , hear only in Heaven :</l>
     <l n="2557">For wonderful indeed are all his works ,</l>
     <l n="2558">Pleasant to know , and worthiest to be all</l>
     <l n="2559">Had in remembrance always with delight ;</l>
     <l n="2560">But what created mind can comprehend</l>
     <l n="2561">Their number , or the wisdom infinite</l>
     <l n="2562">That brought them forth , but hid their causes deep ?</l>
     <l n="2563">I saw when at his word the formless mass ,</l>
     <l n="2564">This world 's material mould , came to a heap :</l>
     <l n="2565">Confusion heard his voice , and wild uproar</l>
     <l n="2566">Stood ruled , stood vast infinitude confined ;</l>
     <l n="2567">Till at his second bidding Darkness fled ,</l>
     <l n="2568">Light shone , and order from disorder sprung :</l>
     <l n="2569">Swift to their several quarters hasted then</l>
     <l n="2570">The cumbrous elements , earth , flood , air , fire ;</l>
     <l n="2571">And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven</l>
     <l n="2572">Flew upward , spirited with various forms ,</l>
     <l n="2573">That rolled orbicular , and turned to stars</l>
     <l n="2574">Numberless , as thou seest , and how they move ;</l>
     <l n="2575">Each had his place appointed , each his course ;</l>
     <l n="2576">The rest in circuit walls this universe .</l>
     <l n="2577">Look downward on that globe , whose hither side</l>
     <l n="2578">With light from hence , though but reflected , shines ;</l>
     <l n="2579">That place is Earth , the seat of Man ; that light</l>
     <l n="2580">His day , which else , as the other hemisphere ,</l>
     <l n="2581">Night would invade ; but there the neighbouring moon</l>
     <l n="2582">( So call that opposite fair star ) her aid</l>
     <l n="2583">Timely interposes , and her monthly round</l>

     <l n="2585">With borrowed light her countenance triform</l>
     <l n="2586">Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth ,</l>
     <l n="2587">And in her pale dominion checks the night .</l>
     <l n="2588">That spot , to which I point , is Paradise ,</l>

     <l n="2599">O , for that warning voice , which he , who saw</l>
     <l n="2600">The Apocalypse , heard cry in Heaven aloud ,</l>
     <l n="2601">Then when the Dragon , put to second rout ,</l>

     <l n="2607">Satan , now first inflamed with rage , came down ,</l>
     <l n="2608">The tempter ere the accuser of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="2609">To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss</l>
     <l n="2610">Of that first battle , and his flight to Hell :</l>

     <l n="2635">Of Sun ! to tell thee how I hate thy beams ,</l>
     <l n="2636">That bring to my remembrance from what state</l>
     <l n="2637">I fell , how glorious once above thy sphere ;</l>
     <l n="2638">Till pride and worse ambition threw me down</l>
     <l n="2639">Warring in Heaven against Heaven 's matchless King :</l>
     <l n="2640">Ah , wherefore ! he deserved no such return</l>
     <l n="2641">From me , whom he created what I was</l>
     <l n="2642">In that bright eminence , and with his good</l>
     <l n="2643">Upbraided none ; nor was his service hard .</l>
     <l n="2644">What could be less than to afford him praise ,</l>
     <l n="2645">The easiest recompence , and pay him thanks ,</l>
     <l n="2646">How due ! yet all his good proved ill in me ,</l>
     <l n="2647">And wrought but malice ; lifted up so high</l>
     <l n="2648">I ‘ sdeined subjection , and thought one step higher</l>
     <l n="2649">Would set me highest , and in a moment quit</l>
     <l n="2650">The debt immense of endless gratitude ,</l>
     <l n="2651">So burdensome still paying , still to owe ,</l>
     <l n="2652">Forgetful what from him I still received ,</l>
     <l n="2653">And understood not that a grateful mind</l>
     <l n="2654">By owing owes not , but still pays , at once</l>
     <l n="2655">Indebted and discharged ; what burden then</l>
     <l n="2656">O , had his powerful destiny ordained</l>
     <l n="2657">Me some inferiour Angel , I had stood</l>
     <l n="2658">Then happy ; no unbounded hope had raised</l>
     <l n="2659">Ambition ! Yet why not some other Power</l>
     <l n="2660">As great might have aspired , and me , though mean ,</l>
     <l n="2661">Drawn to his part ; but other Powers as great</l>
     <l n="2662">Fell not , but stand unshaken , from within</l>
     <l n="2663">Or from without , to all temptations armed .</l>
     <l n="2664">Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand ?</l>
     <l n="2665">Thou hadst : whom hast thou then or what to accuse ,</l>
     <l n="2666">But Heaven 's free love dealt equally to all ?</l>
     <l n="2667">Be then his love accursed , since love or hate ,</l>
     <l n="2668">To me alike , it deals eternal woe .</l>
     <l n="2669">Nay , cursed be thou ; since against his thy will</l>
     <l n="2670">Chose freely what it now so justly rues .</l>
     <l n="2671">Me miserable ! which way shall I fly</l>
     <l n="2672">Infinite wrath , and infinite despair ?</l>
     <l n="2673">Which way I fly is Hell ; myself am Hell ;</l>
     <l n="2674">And , in the lowest deep , a lower deep</l>
     <l n="2675">Still threatening to devour me opens wide ,</l>
     <l n="2676">To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven .</l>
     <l n="2677">O , then , at last relent : Is there no place</l>
     <l n="2678">Left for repentance , none for pardon left ?</l>
     <l n="2679">None left but by submission ; and that word</l>
     <l n="2680">Disdain forbids me , and my dread of shame</l>
     <l n="2681">Among the Spirits beneath , whom I seduced</l>
     <l n="2682">With other promises and other vaunts</l>
     <l n="2683">Than to submit , boasting I could subdue</l>
     <l n="2684">The Omnipotent . Ay me ! they little know</l>
     <l n="2685">How dearly I abide that boast so vain ,</l>
     <l n="2686">Under what torments inwardly I groan ,</l>
     <l n="2687">While they adore me on the throne of Hell .</l>
     <l n="2688">With diadem and scepter high advanced ,</l>
     <l n="2689">The lower still I fall , only supreme</l>
     <l n="2690">In misery : Such joy ambition finds .</l>
     <l n="2691">But say I could repent , and could obtain ,</l>
     <l n="2692">By act of grace , my former state ; how soon</l>
     <l n="2693">Would highth recall high thoughts , how soon unsay</l>
     <l n="2694">What feigned submission swore ? Ease would recant</l>
     <l n="2695">Vows made in pain , as violent and void .</l>
     <l n="2696">For never can true reconcilement grow ,</l>
     <l n="2697">Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep :</l>
     <l n="2698">Which would but lead me to a worse relapse</l>
     <l n="2699">And heavier fall : so should I purchase dear</l>
     <l n="2700">Short intermission bought with double smart .</l>
     <l n="2701">This knows my Punisher ; therefore as far</l>
     <l n="2702">From granting he , as I from begging , peace ;</l>
     <l n="2703">All hope excluded thus , behold , instead</l>
     <l n="2704">Of us out-cast , exil 'd , his new delight ,</l>
     <l n="2705">Mankind created , and for him this world .</l>
     <l n="2706">So farewell , hope ; and with hope farewell , fear ;</l>
     <l n="2707">Farewell , remorse ! all good to me is lost ;</l>
     <l n="2708">Evil , be thou my good ; by thee at least</l>
     <l n="2709">Divided empire with Heaven 's King I hold ,</l>
     <l n="2710">By thee , and more than half perhaps will reign ;</l>
     <l n="2711">As Man ere long , and this new world , shall know .</l>
     <l n="2712">Thus while he spake , each passion dimmed his face</l>
     <l n="2713">Thrice changed with pale , ire , envy , and despair ;</l>
     <l n="2714">Which marred his borrowed visage , and betrayed</l>
     <l n="2715">Him counterfeit , if any eye beheld .</l>
     <l n="2716">For heavenly minds from such distempers foul</l>
     <l n="2717">Are ever clear . Whereof he soon aware ,</l>
     <l n="2718">Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm ,</l>
     <l n="2719">Artificer of fraud ; and was the first</l>
     <l n="2720">That practised falsehood under saintly show ,</l>
     <l n="2721">Deep malice to conceal , couched with revenge :</l>
     <l n="2722">Yet not enough had practised to deceive</l>
     <l n="2723">Uriel once warned ; whose eye pursued him down</l>
     <l n="2724">The way he went , and on the Assyrian mount</l>
     <l n="2725">Saw him disfigured , more than could befall</l>
     <l n="2726">Spirit of happy sort ; his gestures fierce</l>
     <l n="2727">He marked and mad demeanour , then alone ,</l>
     <l n="2728">As he supposed , all unobserved , unseen .</l>
     <l n="2729">So on he fares , and to the border comes</l>
     <l n="2730">Of Eden , where delicious Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="2731">Now nearer , crowns with her enclosure green ,</l>
     <l n="2732">As with a rural mound , the champaign head</l>
     <l n="2733">Of a steep wilderness , whose hairy sides</l>
     <l n="2734">With thicket overgrown , grotesque and wild ,</l>
     <l n="2735">Access denied ; and overhead upgrew</l>
     <l n="2736">Insuperable height of loftiest shade ,</l>
     <l n="2737">Cedar , and pine , and fir , and branching palm ,</l>
     <l n="2738">A sylvan scene , and , as the ranks ascend ,</l>
     <l n="2739">Shade above shade , a woody theatre</l>
     <l n="2740">Of stateliest view . Yet higher than their tops</l>
     <l n="2741">The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung ;</l>
     <l n="2742">Which to our general sire gave prospect large</l>
     <l n="2743">Into his nether empire neighbouring round .</l>
     <l n="2744">And higher than that wall a circling row</l>
     <l n="2745">Of goodliest trees , loaden with fairest fruit ,</l>
     <l n="2746">Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue ,</l>
     <l n="2747">Appeared , with gay enamelled colours mixed :</l>
     <l n="2748">On which the sun more glad impressed his beams</l>
     <l n="2749">Than in fair evening cloud , or humid bow ,</l>
     <l n="2750">When God hath showered the earth ; so lovely seemed</l>
     <l n="2751">That landskip : And of pure now purer air</l>
     <l n="2752">Meets his approach , and to the heart inspires</l>
     <l n="2753">Vernal delight and joy , able to drive</l>
     <l n="2754">All sadness but despair : Now gentle gales ,</l>
     <l n="2755">Fanning their odoriferous wings , dispense</l>
     <l n="2756">Native perfumes , and whisper whence they stole</l>
     <l n="2757">Those balmy spoils . As when to them who fail</l>
     <l n="2758">Beyond the Cape of Hope , and now are past</l>
     <l n="2759">Mozambick , off at sea north-east winds blow</l>
     <l n="2760">Sabean odours from the spicy shore</l>
     <l n="2761">Of Araby the blest ; with such delay</l>
     <l n="2762">Well pleased they slack their course , and many a league</l>
     <l n="2763">Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles :</l>
     <l n="2764">So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend ,</l>
     <l n="2765">Who came their bane ; though with them better pleased</l>
     <l n="2766">Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume</l>
     <l n="2767">That drove him , though enamoured , from the spouse</l>
     <l n="2768">Of Tobit 's son , and with a vengeance sent</l>
     <l n="2769">From Media post to Egypt , there fast bound .</l>
     <l n="2770">Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill</l>
     <l n="2771">Satan had journeyed on , pensive and slow ;</l>
     <l n="2772">But further way found none , so thick entwined ,</l>
     <l n="2773">As one continued brake , the undergrowth</l>
     <l n="2774">Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed</l>
     <l n="2775">All path of man or beast that passed that way .</l>
     <l n="2776">One gate there only was , and that looked east</l>
     <l n="2777">On the other side : which when the arch-felon saw ,</l>
     <l n="2778">Due entrance he disdained ; and , in contempt ,</l>
     <l n="2779">At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound</l>
     <l n="2780">Of hill or highest wall , and sheer within</l>
     <l n="2781">Lights on his feet . As when a prowling wolf ,</l>
     <l n="2782">Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey ,</l>
     <l n="2783">Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve</l>
     <l n="2784">In hurdled cotes amid the field secure ,</l>
     <l n="2785">Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold :</l>
     <l n="2786">Or as a thief , bent to unhoard the cash</l>
     <l n="2787">Of some rich burgher , whose substantial doors ,</l>
     <l n="2788">Cross-barred and bolted fast , fear no assault ,</l>
     <l n="2789">In at the window climbs , or o'er the tiles :</l>
     <l n="2790">So clomb this first grand thief into God 's fold ;</l>
     <l n="2791">So since into his church lewd hirelings climb .</l>
     <l n="2792">Thence up he flew , and on the tree of life ,</l>
     <l n="2793">The middle tree and highest there that grew ,</l>
     <l n="2794">Sat like a cormorant ; yet not true life</l>
     <l n="2795">Thereby regained , but sat devising death</l>
     <l n="2796">To them who lived ; nor on the virtue thought</l>
     <l n="2797">Of that life-giving plant , but only used</l>
     <l n="2798">For prospect , what well used had been the pledge</l>
     <l n="2799">Of immortality . So little knows</l>
     <l n="2800">Any , but God alone , to value right</l>
     <l n="2801">The good before him , but perverts best things</l>
     <l n="2802">To worst abuse , or to their meanest use .</l>
     <l n="2803">Beneath him with new wonder now he views ,</l>
     <l n="2804">To all delight of human sense exposed ,</l>
     <l n="2805">In narrow room , Nature 's whole wealth , yea more ,</l>
     <l n="2806">A Heaven on Earth : For blissful Paradise</l>
     <l n="2807">Of God the garden was , by him in the east</l>
     <l n="2808">Of Eden planted ; Eden stretched her line</l>
     <l n="2809">From Auran eastward to the royal towers</l>
     <l n="2810">Of great Seleucia , built by Grecian kings ,</l>
     <l n="2811">Or where the sons of Eden long before</l>
     <l n="2812">Dwelt in Telassar : In this pleasant soil</l>
     <l n="2813">His far more pleasant garden God ordained ;</l>
     <l n="2814">Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow</l>
     <l n="2815">All trees of noblest kind for sight , smell , taste ;</l>
     <l n="2816">And all amid them stood the tree of life ,</l>
     <l n="2817">High eminent , blooming ambrosial fruit</l>
     <l n="2818">Of vegetable gold ; and next to life ,</l>
     <l n="2819">Our death , the tree of knowledge , grew fast by ,</l>
     <l n="2820">Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill .</l>
     <l n="2821">Southward through Eden went a river large ,</l>
     <l n="2822">Nor changed his course , but through the shaggy hill</l>
     <l n="2823">Passed underneath ingulfed ; for God had thrown</l>
     <l n="2824">That mountain as his garden-mould high raised</l>
     <l n="2825">Upon the rapid current , which , through veins</l>
     <l n="2826">Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn ,</l>
     <l n="2827">Rose a fresh fountain , and with many a rill</l>
     <l n="2828">Watered the garden ; thence united fell</l>
     <l n="2829">Down the steep glade , and met the nether flood ,</l>
     <l n="2830">Which from his darksome passage now appears ,</l>
     <l n="2831">And now , divided into four main streams ,</l>
     <l n="2832">Runs diverse , wandering many a famous realm</l>
     <l n="2833">And country , whereof here needs no account ;</l>
     <l n="2834">But rather to tell how , if Art could tell ,</l>
     <l n="2835">How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks ,</l>
     <l n="2836">Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold ,</l>
     <l n="2837">With mazy errour under pendant shades</l>
     <l n="2838">Ran nectar , visiting each plant , and fed</l>
     <l n="2839">Flowers worthy of Paradise , which not nice Art</l>
     <l n="2840">In beds and curious knots , but Nature boon</l>
     <l n="2841">Poured forth profuse on hill , and dale , and plain ,</l>
     <l n="2842">Both where the morning sun first warmly smote</l>
     <l n="2843">The open field , and where the unpierced shade</l>
     <l n="2844">Imbrowned the noontide bowers : Thus was this place</l>
     <l n="2845">A happy rural seat of various view ;</l>
     <l n="2846">Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm ,</l>
     <l n="2847">Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind ,</l>
     <l n="2848">Hung amiable , Hesperian fables true ,</l>
     <l n="2849">If true , here only , and of delicious taste :</l>
     <l n="2850">Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks</l>
     <l n="2851">Grazing the tender herb , were interposed ,</l>
     <l n="2852">Or palmy hillock ; or the flowery lap</l>
     <l n="2853">Of some irriguous valley spread her store ,</l>
     <l n="2854">Flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose :</l>
     <l n="2855">Another side , umbrageous grots and caves</l>
     <l n="2856">Of cool recess , o'er which the mantling vine</l>
     <l n="2857">Lays forth her purple grape , and gently creeps</l>
     <l n="2858">Luxuriant ; mean while murmuring waters fall</l>
     <l n="2859">Down the slope hills , dispersed , or in a lake ,</l>
     <l n="2860">That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned</l>
     <l n="2861">Her crystal mirrour holds , unite their streams .</l>
     <l n="2862">The birds their quire apply ; airs , vernal airs ,</l>
     <l n="2863">Breathing the smell of field and grove , attune</l>
     <l n="2864">The trembling leaves , while universal Pan ,</l>
     <l n="2865">Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance ,</l>
     <l n="2866">Led on the eternal Spring . Not that fair field</l>
     <l n="2867">Of Enna , where Proserpine gathering flowers ,</l>
     <l n="2868">Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis</l>
     <l n="2869">Was gathered , which cost Ceres all that pain</l>
     <l n="2870">To seek her through the world ; nor that sweet grove</l>
     <l n="2871">Of Daphne by Orontes , and the inspired</l>
     <l n="2872">Castalian spring , might with this Paradise</l>
     <l n="2873">Of Eden strive ; nor that Nyseian isle</l>
     <l n="2874">Girt with the river Triton , where old Cham ,</l>
     <l n="2875">Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove ,</l>
     <l n="2876">Hid Amalthea , and her florid son</l>
     <l n="2877">Young Bacchus , from his stepdame Rhea 's eye ;</l>
     <l n="2878">Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard ,</l>
     <l n="2879">Mount Amara , though this by some supposed</l>
     <l n="2880">True Paradise under the Ethiop line</l>
     <l n="2881">By Nilus ’ head , enclosed with shining rock ,</l>
     <l n="2882">A whole day 's journey high , but wide remote</l>
     <l n="2883">From this Assyrian garden , where the Fiend</l>
     <l n="2884">Saw , undelighted , all delight , all kind</l>
     <l n="2885">Of living creatures , new to sight , and strange</l>
     <l n="2886">Two of far nobler shape , erect and tall ,</l>
     <l n="2887">Godlike erect , with native honour clad</l>
     <l n="2888">In naked majesty seemed lords of all :</l>
     <l n="2889">And worthy seemed ; for in their looks divine</l>
     <l n="2890">The image of their glorious Maker shone ,</l>
     <l n="2891">Truth , wisdom , sanctitude severe and pure ,</l>
     <l n="2892">( Severe , but in true filial freedom placed ,)</l>
     <l n="2893">Whence true authority in men ; though both</l>
     <l n="2894">Not equal , as their sex not equal seemed ;</l>
     <l n="2895">For contemplation he and valour formed ;</l>
     <l n="2896">For softness she and sweet attractive grace ;</l>
     <l n="2897">He for God only , she for God in him :</l>
     <l n="2898">His fair large front and eye sublime declared</l>
     <l n="2899">Absolute rule ; and hyacinthine locks</l>
     <l n="2900">Round from his parted forelock manly hung</l>
     <l n="2901">Clustering , but not beneath his shoulders broad :</l>
     <l n="2902">She , as a veil , down to the slender waist</l>
     <l n="2903">Her unadorned golden tresses wore</l>
     <l n="2904">Dishevelled , but in wanton ringlets waved</l>
     <l n="2905">As the vine curls her tendrils , which implied</l>
     <l n="2906">Subjection , but required with gentle sway ,</l>
     <l n="2907">And by her yielded , by him best received ,</l>
     <l n="2908">Yielded with coy submission , modest pride ,</l>
     <l n="2909">And sweet , reluctant , amorous delay .</l>
     <l n="2910">Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed ;</l>
     <l n="2911">Then was not guilty shame , dishonest shame</l>
     <l n="2912">Of nature 's works , honour dishonourable ,</l>
     <l n="2913">Sin-bred , how have ye troubled all mankind</l>
     <l n="2914">With shows instead , mere shows of seeming pure ,</l>
     <l n="2915">And banished from man 's life his happiest life ,</l>
     <l n="2916">Simplicity and spotless innocence !</l>
     <l n="2917">So passed they naked on , nor shunned the sight</l>
     <l n="2918">Of God or Angel ; for they thought no ill :</l>
     <l n="2919">So hand in hand they passed , the loveliest pair ,</l>
     <l n="2920">That ever since in love 's embraces met ;</l>
     <l n="2921">Adam the goodliest man of men since born</l>
     <l n="2922">His sons , the fairest of her daughters Eve .</l>
     <l n="2923">Under a tuft of shade that on a green</l>
     <l n="2924">Stood whispering soft , by a fresh fountain side</l>
     <l n="2925">They sat them down ; and , after no more toil</l>
     <l n="2926">Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed</l>
     <l n="2927">To recommend cool Zephyr , and made ease</l>
     <l n="2928">More easy , wholesome thirst and appetite</l>
     <l n="2929">More grateful , to their supper-fruits they fell ,</l>
     <l n="2930">Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs</l>
     <l n="2931">Yielded them , side-long as they sat recline</l>
     <l n="2932">On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers :</l>
     <l n="2933">The savoury pulp they chew , and in the rind ,</l>
     <l n="2934">Still as they thirsted , scoop the brimming stream ;</l>
     <l n="2935">Nor gentle purpose , nor endearing smiles</l>
     <l n="2936">Wanted , nor youthful dalliance , as beseems</l>
     <l n="2937">Fair couple , linked in happy nuptial league ,</l>
     <l n="2938">Alone as they . About them frisking played</l>
     <l n="2939">All beasts of the earth , since wild , and of all chase</l>
     <l n="2940">In wood or wilderness , forest or den ;</l>
     <l n="2941">Sporting the lion ramped , and in his paw</l>
     <l n="2942">Dandled the kid ; bears , tigers , ounces , pards ,</l>
     <l n="2943">Gambolled before them ; the unwieldy elephant ,</l>
     <l n="2944">To make them mirth , used all his might , and wreathed</l>
     <l n="2945">His lithe proboscis ; close the serpent sly ,</l>
     <l n="2946">Insinuating , wove with Gordian twine</l>
     <l n="2947">His braided train , and of his fatal guile</l>
     <l n="2948">Gave proof unheeded ; others on the grass</l>
     <l n="2949">Couched , and now filled with pasture gazing sat ,</l>
     <l n="2950">Or bedward ruminating ; for the sun ,</l>
     <l n="2951">Declined , was hasting now with prone career</l>
     <l n="2952">To the ocean isles , and in the ascending scale</l>
     <l n="2953">Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose :</l>
     <l n="2954">When Satan still in gaze , as first he stood ,</l>
     <l n="2955">Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad .</l>
     <l n="2956">O Hell ! what do mine eyes with grief behold !</l>
     <l n="2957">Into our room of bliss thus high advanced</l>
     <l n="2958">Creatures of other mould , earth-born perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="2959">Not Spirits , yet to heavenly Spirits bright</l>
     <l n="2960">Little inferiour ; whom my thoughts pursue</l>
     <l n="2961">With wonder , and could love , so lively shines</l>
     <l n="2962">In them divine resemblance , and such grace</l>
     <l n="2963">The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured .</l>
     <l n="2964">Ah ! gentle pair , ye little think how nigh</l>
     <l n="2965">Your change approaches , when all these delights</l>
     <l n="2966">Will vanish , and deliver ye to woe ;</l>
     <l n="2967">More woe , the more your taste is now of joy ;</l>
     <l n="2968">Happy , but for so happy ill secured</l>
     <l n="2969">Long to continue , and this high seat your Heaven</l>
     <l n="2970">Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe</l>
     <l n="2971">As now is entered ; yet no purposed foe</l>
     <l n="2972">To you , whom I could pity thus forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="2973">Though I unpitied : League with you I seek ,</l>
     <l n="2974">And mutual amity , so strait , so close ,</l>
     <l n="2975">That I with you must dwell , or you with me</l>
     <l n="2976">Henceforth ; my dwelling haply may not please ,</l>
     <l n="2977">Like this fair Paradise , your sense ; yet such</l>
     <l n="2978">Accept your Maker 's work ; he gave it me ,</l>
     <l n="2979">Which I as freely give : Hell shall unfold ,</l>
     <l n="2980">To entertain you two , her widest gates ,</l>
     <l n="2981">And send forth all her kings ; there will be room ,</l>
     <l n="2982">Not like these narrow limits , to receive</l>
     <l n="2983">Your numerous offspring ; if no better place ,</l>
     <l n="2984">Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge</l>
     <l n="2985">On you who wrong me not for him who wronged .</l>
     <l n="2986">And should I at your harmless innocence</l>
     <l n="2987">Melt , as I do , yet publick reason just ,</l>
     <l n="2988">Honour and empire with revenge enlarged ,</l>
     <l n="2989">By conquering this new world , compels me now</l>
     <l n="2990">To do what else , though damned , I should abhor .</l>
     <l n="2991">So spake the Fiend , and with necessity ,</l>
     <l n="2992">The tyrant 's plea , excused his devilish deeds .</l>
     <l n="2993">Then from his lofty stand on that high tree</l>
     <l n="2994">Down he alights among the sportful herd</l>
     <l n="2995">Of those four-footed kinds , himself now one ,</l>
     <l n="2996">Now other , as their shape served best his end</l>
     <l n="2997">Nearer to view his prey , and , unespied ,</l>
     <l n="2998">To mark what of their state he more might learn ,</l>
     <l n="2999">By word or action marked . About them round</l>
     <l n="3000">A lion now he stalks with fiery glare ;</l>
     <l n="3001">Then as a tiger , who by chance hath spied</l>
     <l n="3002">In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play ,</l>
     <l n="3003">Straight couches close , then , rising , changes oft</l>
     <l n="3004">His couchant watch , as one who chose his ground ,</l>
     <l n="3005">Whence rushing , he might surest seize them both ,</l>
     <l n="3006">Griped in each paw : when , Adam first of men</l>
     <l n="3007">To first of women Eve thus moving speech ,</l>
     <l n="3008">Turned him , all ear to hear new utterance flow .</l>
     <l n="3009">Sole partner , and sole part , of all these joys ,</l>
     <l n="3010">Dearer thyself than all ; needs must the Power</l>
     <l n="3011">That made us , and for us this ample world ,</l>
     <l n="3012">Be infinitely good , and of his good</l>
     <l n="3013">As liberal and free as infinite ;</l>
     <l n="3014">That raised us from the dust , and placed us here</l>
     <l n="3015">In all this happiness , who at his hand</l>
     <l n="3016">Have nothing merited , nor can perform</l>
     <l n="3017">Aught whereof he hath need ; he who requires</l>
     <l n="3018">From us no other service than to keep</l>
     <l n="3019">This one , this easy charge , of all the trees</l>
     <l n="3020">In Paradise that bear delicious fruit</l>
     <l n="3021">So various , not to taste that only tree</l>
     <l n="3022">Of knowledge , planted by the tree of life ;</l>
     <l n="3023">So near grows death to life , whate'er death is ,</l>
     <l n="3024">Some dreadful thing no doubt ; for well thou knowest</l>
     <l n="3025">God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree ,</l>
     <l n="3026">The only sign of our obedience left ,</l>
     <l n="3027">Among so many signs of power and rule</l>
     <l n="3028">Conferred upon us , and dominion given</l>
     <l n="3029">Over all other creatures that possess</l>
     <l n="3030">Earth , air , and sea . Then let us not think hard</l>
     <l n="3031">One easy prohibition , who enjoy</l>
     <l n="3032">Free leave so large to all things else , and choice</l>
     <l n="3033">Unlimited of manifold delights :</l>
     <l n="3034">But let us ever praise him , and extol</l>
     <l n="3035">His bounty , following our delightful task ,</l>
     <l n="3036">To prune these growing plants , and tend these flowers ,</l>
     <l n="3037">Which were it toilsome , yet with thee were sweet .</l>
     <l n="3038">To whom thus Eve replied . O thou for whom</l>
     <l n="3039">And from whom I was formed , flesh of thy flesh ,</l>
     <l n="3040">And without whom am to no end , my guide</l>
     <l n="3041">And head ! what thou hast said is just and right .</l>
     <l n="3042">For we to him indeed all praises owe ,</l>
     <l n="3043">And daily thanks ; I chiefly , who enjoy</l>
     <l n="3044">So far the happier lot , enjoying thee</l>
     <l n="3045">Pre-eminent by so much odds , while thou</l>
     <l n="3046">Like consort to thyself canst no where find .</l>
     <l n="3047">That day I oft remember , when from sleep</l>
     <l n="3048">I first awaked , and found myself reposed</l>
     <l n="3049">Under a shade on flowers , much wondering where</l>
     <l n="3050">And what I was , whence thither brought , and how .</l>
     <l n="3051">Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound</l>
     <l n="3052">Of waters issued from a cave , and spread</l>
     <l n="3053">Into a liquid plain , then stood unmoved</l>
     <l n="3054">Pure as the expanse of Heaven ; I thither went</l>
     <l n="3055">With unexperienced thought , and laid me down</l>
     <l n="3056">On the green bank , to look into the clear</l>
     <l n="3057">Smooth lake , that to me seemed another sky .</l>
     <l n="3058">As I bent down to look , just opposite</l>
     <l n="3059">A shape within the watery gleam appeared ,</l>
     <l n="3060">Bending to look on me : I started back ,</l>
     <l n="3061">It started back ; but pleased I soon returned ,</l>
     <l n="3062">Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks</l>
     <l n="3063">Of sympathy and love : There I had fixed</l>
     <l n="3064">Mine eyes till now , and pined with vain desire ,</l>
     <l n="3065">Had not a voice thus warned me ; “ What thou seest ,</l>
     <l n="3066">What there thou seest , fair Creature , is thyself ;</l>
     <l n="3067">With thee it came and goes : but follow me ,</l>
     <l n="3068">And I will bring thee where no shadow stays</l>
     <l n="3069">Thy coming , and thy soft embraces , he</l>
     <l n="3070">Whose image thou art ; him thou shalt enjoy</l>
     <l n="3071">Inseparably thine , to him shalt bear</l>
     <l n="3072">Multitudes like thyself , and thence be called</l>
     <l n="3073">Mother of human race . ” What could I do ,</l>
     <l n="3074">But follow straight , invisibly thus led ?</l>
     <l n="3075">Till I espied thee , fair indeed and tall ,</l>
     <l n="3076">Under a platane ; yet methought less fair ,</l>
     <l n="3077">Less winning soft , less amiably mild ,</l>
     <l n="3078">Than that smooth watery image : Back I turned ;</l>
     <l n="3079">Thou following cryedst aloud , “ Return , fair Eve ;</l>
     <l n="3080">Whom flyest thou ? whom thou flyest , of him thou art ,</l>
     <l n="3081">His flesh , his bone ; to give thee being I lent</l>
     <l n="3082">Out of my side to thee , nearest my heart ,</l>
     <l n="3083">Substantial life , to have thee by my side</l>
     <l n="3084">Henceforth an individual solace dear ;</l>
     <l n="3085">Part of my soul I seek thee , and thee claim</l>
     <l n="3086">My other half : ” With that thy gentle hand</l>
     <l n="3087">Seised mine : I yielded ; and from that time see</l>
     <l n="3088">How beauty is excelled by manly grace ,</l>
     <l n="3089">And wisdom , which alone is truly fair .</l>
     <l n="3090">So spake our general mother , and with eyes</l>
     <l n="3091">Of conjugal attraction unreproved ,</l>
     <l n="3092">And meek surrender , half-embracing leaned</l>
     <l n="3093">On our first father ; half her swelling breast</l>
     <l n="3094">Naked met his , under the flowing gold</l>
     <l n="3095">Of her loose tresses hid : he in delight</l>
     <l n="3096">Both of her beauty , and submissive charms ,</l>
     <l n="3097">Smiled with superiour love , as Jupiter</l>
     <l n="3098">On Juno smiles , when he impregns the clouds</l>
     <l n="3099">That shed Mayflowers ; and pressed her matron lip</l>
     <l n="3100">With kisses pure : Aside the Devil turned</l>
     <l n="3101">For envy ; yet with jealous leer malign</l>
     <l n="3102">Eyed them askance , and to himself thus plained .</l>
     <l n="3103">Sight hateful , sight tormenting ! thus these two ,</l>
     <l n="3104">Imparadised in one another 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="3105">The happier Eden , shall enjoy their fill</l>
     <l n="3106">Of bliss on bliss ; while I to Hell am thrust ,</l>
     <l n="3107">Where neither joy nor love , but fierce desire ,</l>
     <l n="3108">Among our other torments not the least ,</l>
     <l n="3109">Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines .</l>
     <l n="3110">Yet let me not forget what I have gained</l>
     <l n="3111">From their own mouths : All is not theirs , it seems ;</l>
     <l n="3112">One fatal tree there stands , of knowledge called ,</l>
     <l n="3113">Forbidden them to taste : Knowledge forbidden</l>
     <l n="3114">Suspicious , reasonless . Why should their Lord</l>
     <l n="3115">Envy them that ? Can it be sin to know ?</l>
     <l n="3116">Can it be death ? And do they only stand</l>
     <l n="3117">By ignorance ? Is that their happy state ,</l>
     <l n="3118">The proof of their obedience and their faith ?</l>
     <l n="3119">O fair foundation laid whereon to build</l>
     <l n="3120">Their ruin ! hence I will excite their minds</l>
     <l n="3121">With more desire to know , and to reject</l>
     <l n="3122">Envious commands , invented with design</l>
     <l n="3123">To keep them low , whom knowledge might exalt</l>
     <l n="3124">Equal with Gods : aspiring to be such ,</l>
     <l n="3125">They taste and die : What likelier can ensue</l>
     <l n="3126">But first with narrow search I must walk round</l>
     <l n="3127">This garden , and no corner leave unspied ;</l>
     <l n="3128">A chance but chance may lead where I may meet</l>
     <l n="3129">Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side ,</l>
     <l n="3130">Or in thick shade retired , from him to draw</l>
     <l n="3131">What further would be learned . Live while ye may ,</l>
     <l n="3132">Yet happy pair ; enjoy , till I return ,</l>
     <l n="3133">Short pleasures , for long woes are to succeed !</l>
     <l n="3134">So saying , his proud step he scornful turned ,</l>
     <l n="3135">But with sly circumspection , and began</l>
     <l n="3136">Through wood , through waste , o'er hill , o'er dale , his roam</l>
     <l n="3137">Mean while in utmost longitude , where Heaven</l>
     <l n="3138">With earth and ocean meets , the setting sun</l>
     <l n="3139">Slowly descended , and with right aspect</l>
     <l n="3140">Against the eastern gate of Paradise</l>
     <l n="3141">Levelled his evening rays : It was a rock</l>
     <l n="3142">Of alabaster , piled up to the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="3143">Conspicuous far , winding with one ascent</l>
     <l n="3144">Accessible from earth , one entrance high ;</l>
     <l n="3145">The rest was craggy cliff , that overhung</l>
     <l n="3146">Still as it rose , impossible to climb .</l>
     <l n="3147">Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat ,</l>
     <l n="3148">Chief of the angelick guards , awaiting night ;</l>
     <l n="3149">About him exercised heroick games</l>
     <l n="3150">The unarmed youth of Heaven , but nigh at hand</l>
     <l n="3151">Celestial armoury , shields , helms , and spears ,</l>
     <l n="3152">Hung high with diamond flaming , and with gold .</l>
     <l n="3153">Thither came Uriel , gliding through the even</l>
     <l n="3154">On a sun-beam , swift as a shooting star</l>
     <l n="3155">In autumn thwarts the night , when vapours fired</l>
     <l n="3156">Impress the air , and shows the mariner</l>
     <l n="3157">From what point of his compass to beware</l>
     <l n="3158">Impetuous winds : He thus began in haste .</l>
     <l n="3159">Gabriel , to thee thy course by lot hath given</l>
     <l n="3160">Charge and strict watch , that to this happy place</l>
     <l n="3161">No evil thing approach or enter in .</l>
     <l n="3162">This day at highth of noon came to my sphere</l>
     <l n="3163">A Spirit , zealous , as he seemed , to know</l>
     <l n="3164">More of the Almighty 's works , and chiefly Man ,</l>
     <l n="3165">God 's latest image : I described his way</l>
     <l n="3166">Bent all on speed , and marked his aery gait ;</l>
     <l n="3167">But in the mount that lies from Eden north ,</l>
     <l n="3168">Where he first lighted , soon discerned his looks</l>
     <l n="3169">Alien from Heaven , with passions foul obscured :</l>
     <l n="3170">Mine eye pursued him still , but under shade</l>
     <l n="3171">Lost sight of him : One of the banished crew ,</l>
     <l n="3172">I fear , hath ventured from the deep , to raise</l>
     <l n="3173">New troubles ; him thy care must be to find .</l>
     <l n="3174">To whom the winged warriour thus returned .</l>
     <l n="3175">Uriel , no wonder if thy perfect sight ,</l>
     <l n="3176">Amid the sun 's bright circle where thou sitst ,</l>
     <l n="3177">See far and wide : In at this gate none pass</l>
     <l n="3178">The vigilance here placed , but such as come</l>
     <l n="3179">Well known from Heaven ; and since meridian hour</l>
     <l n="3180">No creature thence : If Spirit of other sort ,</l>
     <l n="3181">So minded , have o'erhYpppHeNleaped these earthly bounds</l>
     <l n="3182">On purpose , hard thou knowest it to exclude</l>
     <l n="3183">Spiritual substance with corporeal bar .</l>
     <l n="3184">But if within the circuit of these walks ,</l>
     <l n="3185">In whatsoever shape he lurk , of whom</l>
     <l n="3186">Thou tellest , by morrow dawning I shall know .</l>
     <l n="3187">So promised he ; and Uriel to his charge</l>
     <l n="3188">Returned on that bright beam , whose point now raised</l>
     <l n="3189">Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen</l>
     <l n="3190">Beneath the Azores ; whether the prime orb ,</l>
     <l n="3191">Incredible how swift , had thither rolled</l>
     <l n="3192">Diurnal , or this less volubil earth ,</l>
     <l n="3193">By shorter flight to the east , had left him there</l>
     <l n="3194">Arraying with reflected purple and gold</l>
     <l n="3195">The clouds that on his western throne attend .</l>
     <l n="3196">Now came still Evening on , and Twilight gray</l>
     <l n="3197">Had in her sober livery all things clad ;</l>
     <l n="3198">Silence accompanied ; for beast and bird ,</l>
     <l n="3199">They to their grassy couch , these to their nests</l>
     <l n="3200">Were slunk , all but the wakeful nightingale ;</l>
     <l n="3201">She all night long her amorous descant sung ;</l>
     <l n="3202">Silence was pleased : Now glowed the firmament</l>
     <l n="3203">With living sapphires : Hesperus , that led</l>
     <l n="3204">The starry host , rode brightest , till the moon ,</l>
     <l n="3205">Rising in clouded majesty , at length</l>
     <l n="3206">Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light ,</l>
     <l n="3207">And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw .</l>
     <l n="3208">When Adam thus to Eve . Fair Consort , the hour</l>
     <l n="3209">Of night , and all things now retired to rest ,</l>
     <l n="3210">Mind us of like repose ; since God hath set</l>
     <l n="3211">Labour and rest , as day and night , to men</l>
     <l n="3212">Successive ; and the timely dew of sleep ,</l>
     <l n="3213">Now falling with soft slumbrous weight , inclines</l>
     <l n="3214">Our eye-lids : Other creatures all day long</l>
     <l n="3215">Rove idle , unemployed , and less need rest ;</l>
     <l n="3216">Man hath his daily work of body or mind</l>
     <l n="3217">Appointed , which declares his dignity ,</l>
     <l n="3218">And the regard of Heaven on all his ways ;</l>
     <l n="3219">While other animals unactive range ,</l>
     <l n="3220">And of their doings God takes no account .</l>
     <l n="3221">To-morrow , ere fresh morning streak the east</l>
     <l n="3222">With first approach of light , we must be risen ,</l>
     <l n="3223">And at our pleasant labour , to reform</l>
     <l n="3224">Yon flowery arbours , yonder alleys green ,</l>
     <l n="3225">Our walk at noon , with branches overgrown ,</l>
     <l n="3226">That mock our scant manuring , and require</l>
     <l n="3227">More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth :</l>
     <l n="3228">Those blossoms also , and those dropping gums ,</l>
     <l n="3229">That lie bestrown , unsightly and unsmooth ,</l>
     <l n="3230">Ask riddance , if we mean to tread with ease ;</l>
     <l n="3231">Mean while , as Nature wills , night bids us rest .</l>
     <l n="3232">To whom thus Eve , with perfect beauty adorned</l>
     <l n="3233">My Author and Disposer , what thou bidst</l>
     <l n="3234">Unargued I obey : So God ordains ;</l>
     <l n="3235">God is thy law , thou mine : To know no more</l>
     <l n="3236">Is woman 's happiest knowledge , and her praise .</l>
     <l n="3237">With thee conversing I forget all time ;</l>
     <l n="3238">All seasons , and their change , all please alike .</l>
     <l n="3239">Sweet is the breath of Morn , her rising sweet ,</l>
     <l n="3240">With charm of earliest birds : pleasant the sun ,</l>
     <l n="3241">When first on this delightful land he spreads</l>
     <l n="3242">His orient beams , on herb , tree , fruit , and flower ,</l>
     <l n="3243">Glistering with dew ; fragrant the fertile earth</l>
     <l n="3244">After soft showers ; and sweet the coming on</l>
     <l n="3245">Of grateful Evening mild ; then silent Night ,</l>
     <l n="3246">With this her solemn bird , and this fair moon ,</l>
     <l n="3247">And these the gems of Heaven , her starry train :</l>
     <l n="3248">But neither breath of Morn , when she ascends</l>
     <l n="3249">With charm of earliest birds ; nor rising sun</l>
     <l n="3250">On this delightful land ; nor herb , fruit , flower ,</l>
     <l n="3251">Glistering with dew ; nor fragrance after showers ;</l>
     <l n="3252">Nor grateful Evening mild ; nor silent Night ,</l>
     <l n="3253">With this her solemn bird , nor walk by moon ,</l>
     <l n="3254">Or glittering star-light , without thee is sweet .</l>
     <l n="3255">But wherefore all night long shine these ? for whom</l>
     <l n="3256">This glorious sight , when sleep hath shut all eyes ?</l>
     <l n="3257">To whom our general ancestor replied .</l>
     <l n="3258">Daughter of God and Man , accomplished Eve ,</l>
     <l n="3259">These have their course to finish round the earth ,</l>
     <l n="3260">By morrow evening , and from land to land</l>
     <l n="3261">In order , though to nations yet unborn ,</l>
     <l n="3262">Ministring light prepared , they set and rise ;</l>
     <l n="3263">Lest total Darkness should by night regain</l>
     <l n="3264">Her old possession , and extinguish life</l>
     <l n="3265">In Nature and all things ; which these soft fires</l>
     <l n="3266">Not only enlighten , but with kindly heat</l>
     <l n="3267">Of various influence foment and warm ,</l>
     <l n="3268">Temper or nourish , or in part shed down</l>
     <l n="3269">Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow</l>
     <l n="3270">On earth , made hereby apter to receive</l>
     <l n="3271">Perfection from the sun 's more potent ray .</l>
     <l n="3272">These then , though unbeheld in deep of night ,</l>
     <l n="3273">Shine not in vain ; nor think , though men were none ,</l>
     <l n="3274">That Heaven would want spectators , God want praise :</l>
     <l n="3275">Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth</l>
     <l n="3276">Unseen , both when we wake , and when we sleep :</l>
     <l n="3277">All these with ceaseless praise his works behold</l>
     <l n="3278">Both day and night : How often from the steep</l>
     <l n="3279">Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard</l>
     <l n="3280">Celestial voices to the midnight air ,</l>
     <l n="3281">Sole , or responsive each to others note ,</l>
     <l n="3282">Singing their great Creator ? oft in bands</l>
     <l n="3283">While they keep watch , or nightly rounding walk ,</l>
     <l n="3284">With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds</l>
     <l n="3285">In full harmonick number joined , their songs</l>
     <l n="3286">Divide the night , and lift our thoughts to Heaven .</l>
     <l n="3287">Thus talking , hand in hand alone they passed</l>
     <l n="3288">On to their blissful bower : it was a place</l>
     <l n="3289">Chosen by the sovran Planter , when he framed</l>
     <l n="3290">All things to Man 's delightful use ; the roof</l>
     <l n="3291">Of thickest covert was inwoven shade</l>
     <l n="3292">Laurel and myrtle , and what higher grew</l>
     <l n="3293">Of firm and fragrant leaf ; on either side</l>
     <l n="3294">Acanthus , and each odorous bushy shrub ,</l>
     <l n="3295">Fenced up the verdant wall ; each beauteous flower ,</l>
     <l n="3296">Iris all hues , roses , and jessamin ,</l>
     <l n="3297">Reared high their flourished heads between , and wrought</l>
     <l n="3298">Mosaick ; underfoot the violet ,</l>
     <l n="3299">Crocus , and hyacinth , with rich inlay</l>
     <l n="3300">Broidered the ground , more coloured than with stone</l>
     <l n="3301">Of costliest emblem : Other creature here ,</l>
     <l n="3302">Bird , beast , insect , or worm , durst enter none ,</l>
     <l n="3303">Such was their awe of Man . In shadier bower</l>
     <l n="3304">More sacred and sequestered , though but feigned ,</l>
     <l n="3305">Pan or Sylvanus never slept , nor Nymph</l>
     <l n="3306">Nor Faunus haunted . Here , in close recess ,</l>
     <l n="3307">With flowers , garlands , and sweet-smelling herbs ,</l>
     <l n="3308">Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed ;</l>
     <l n="3309">And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung ,</l>
     <l n="3310">What day the genial Angel to our sire</l>
     <l n="3311">Brought her in naked beauty more adorned ,</l>
     <l n="3312">More lovely , than Pandora , whom the Gods</l>
     <l n="3313">Endowed with all their gifts , and O ! too like</l>
     <l n="3314">In sad event , when to the unwiser son</l>
     <l n="3315">Of Japhet brought by Hermes , she ensnared</l>
     <l n="3316">Mankind with her fair looks , to be avenged</l>
     <l n="3317">On him who had stole Jove 's authentick fire .</l>
     <l n="3318">Thus , at their shady lodge arrived , both stood ,</l>
     <l n="3319">Both turned , and under open sky adored</l>
     <l n="3320">The God that made both sky , air , earth , and heaven ,</l>
     <l n="3321">Which they beheld , the moon 's resplendent globe ,</l>
     <l n="3322">And starry pole : Thou also madest the night ,</l>
     <l n="3323">Maker Omnipotent , and thou the day ,</l>
     <l n="3324">Which we , in our appointed work employed ,</l>
     <l n="3325">Have finished , happy in our mutual help</l>
     <l n="3326">And mutual love , the crown of all our bliss</l>
     <l n="3327">Ordained by thee ; and this delicious place</l>
     <l n="3328">For us too large , where thy abundance wants</l>
     <l n="3329">Partakers , and uncropt falls to the ground .</l>
     <l n="3330">But thou hast promised from us two a race</l>
     <l n="3331">To fill the earth , who shall with us extol</l>
     <l n="3332">Thy goodness infinite , both when we wake ,</l>
     <l n="3333">And when we seek , as now , thy gift of sleep .</l>
     <l n="3334">This said unanimous , and other rites</l>
     <l n="3335">Observing none , but adoration pure</l>
     <l n="3336">Which God likes best , into their inmost bower</l>
     <l n="3337">Handed they went ; and , eased the putting off</l>
     <l n="3338">These troublesome disguises which we wear ,</l>
     <l n="3339">Straight side by side were laid ; nor turned , I ween ,</l>
     <l n="3340">Adam from his fair spouse , nor Eve the rites</l>
     <l n="3341">Mysterious of connubial love refused :</l>
     <l n="3342">Whatever hypocrites austerely talk</l>
     <l n="3343">Of purity , and place , and innocence ,</l>
     <l n="3344">Defaming as impure what God declares</l>
     <l n="3345">Pure , and commands to some , leaves free to all .</l>
     <l n="3346">Our Maker bids encrease ; who bids abstain</l>
     <l n="3347">But our Destroyer , foe to God and Man ?</l>
     <l n="3348">Hail , wedded Love , mysterious law , true source</l>
     <l n="3349">Of human offspring , sole propriety</l>
     <l n="3350">In Paradise of all things common else !</l>
     <l n="3351">By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men</l>
     <l n="3352">Among the bestial herds to range ; by thee</l>
     <l n="3353">Founded in reason , loyal , just , and pure ,</l>
     <l n="3354">Relations dear , and all the charities</l>
     <l n="3355">Of father , son , and brother , first were known .</l>
     <l n="3356">Far be it , that I should write thee sin or blame ,</l>
     <l n="3357">Or think thee unbefitting holiest place ,</l>
     <l n="3358">Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets ,</l>
     <l n="3359">Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced ,</l>
     <l n="3360">Present , or past , as saints and patriarchs used .</l>
     <l n="3361">Here Love his golden shafts employs , here lights</l>
     <l n="3362">His constant lamp , and waves his purple wings ,</l>
     <l n="3363">Reigns here and revels ; not in the bought smile</l>
     <l n="3364">Of harlots , loveless , joyless , unendeared ,</l>
     <l n="3365">Casual fruition ; nor in court-amours ,</l>
     <l n="3366">Mixed dance , or wanton mask , or midnight ball ,</l>
     <l n="3367">Or serenate , which the starved lover sings</l>
     <l n="3368">To his proud fair , best quitted with disdain .</l>
     <l n="3369">These , lulled by nightingales , embracing slept ,</l>
     <l n="3370">And on their naked limbs the flowery roof</l>
     <l n="3371">Showered roses , which the morn repaired . Sleep on ,</l>
     <l n="3372">Blest pair ; and O ! yet happiest , if ye seek</l>
     <l n="3373">No happier state , and know to know no more .</l>
     <l n="3374">Now had night measured with her shadowy cone</l>
     <l n="3375">Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault ,</l>
     <l n="3376">And from their ivory port the Cherubim ,</l>
     <l n="3377">Forth issuing at the accustomed hour , stood armed</l>
     <l n="3378">To their night watches in warlike parade ;</l>
     <l n="3379">When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake .</l>
     <l n="3380">Uzziel , half these draw off , and coast the south</l>
     <l n="3381">With strictest watch ; these other wheel the north ;</l>
     <l n="3382">Our circuit meets full west . As flame they part ,</l>
     <l n="3383">Half wheeling to the shield , half to the spear .</l>
     <l n="3384">From these , two strong and subtle Spirits he called</l>
     <l n="3385">That near him stood , and gave them thus in charge .</l>
     <l n="3386">Ithuriel and Zephon , with winged speed</l>
     <l n="3387">Search through this garden , leave unsearched no nook ;</l>
     <l n="3388">But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge ,</l>
     <l n="3389">Now laid perhaps asleep , secure of harm .</l>
     <l n="3390">This evening from the sun 's decline arrived ,</l>
     <l n="3391">Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen</l>
     <l n="3392">Hitherward bent ( who could have thought ? ) escaped</l>
     <l n="3393">The bars of Hell , on errand bad no doubt :</l>
     <l n="3394">Such , where ye find , seise fast , and hither bring .</l>
     <l n="3395">So saying , on he led his radiant files ,</l>
     <l n="3396">Dazzling the moon ; these to the bower direct</l>
     <l n="3397">In search of whom they sought : Him there they found</l>
     <l n="3398">Squat like a toad , close at the ear of Eve ,</l>
     <l n="3399">Assaying by his devilish art to reach</l>
     <l n="3400">The organs of her fancy , and with them forge</l>
     <l n="3401">Illusions , as he list , phantasms and dreams ;</l>
     <l n="3402">Or if , inspiring venom , he might taint</l>
     <l n="3403">The animal spirits , that from pure blood arise</l>
     <l n="3404">Like gentle breaths from rivers pure , thence raise</l>
     <l n="3405">At least distempered , discontented thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="3406">Vain hopes , vain aims , inordinate desires ,</l>
     <l n="3407">Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride .</l>
     <l n="3408">Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear</l>
     <l n="3409">Touched lightly ; for no falshood can endure</l>
     <l n="3410">Touch of celestial temper , but returns</l>
     <l n="3411">Of force to its own likeness : Up he starts</l>
     <l n="3412">Discovered and surprised . As when a spark</l>
     <l n="3413">Lights on a heap of nitrous powder , laid</l>
     <l n="3414">Fit for the tun some magazine to store</l>
     <l n="3415">Against a rumoured war , the smutty grain ,</l>
     <l n="3416">With sudden blaze diffused , inflames the air ;</l>
     <l n="3417">So started up in his own shape the Fiend .</l>
     <l n="3418">Back stept those two fair Angels , half amazed</l>
     <l n="3419">So sudden to behold the grisly king ;</l>
     <l n="3420">Yet thus , unmoved with fear , accost him soon .</l>
     <l n="3421">Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell</l>
     <l n="3422">Comest thou , escaped thy prison ? and , transformed ,</l>
     <l n="3423">Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait ,</l>
     <l n="3424">Here watching at the head of these that sleep ?</l>
     <l n="3425">Know ye not then said Satan , filled with scorn ,</l>
     <l n="3426">Know ye not me ? ye knew me once no mate</l>
     <l n="3427">For you , there sitting where ye durst not soar :</l>
     <l n="3428">Not to know me argues yourselves unknown ,</l>
     <l n="3429">The lowest of your throng ; or , if ye know ,</l>
     <l n="3430">Why ask ye , and superfluous begin</l>
     <l n="3431">Your message , like to end as much in vain ?</l>
     <l n="3432">To whom thus Zephon , answering scorn with scorn .</l>
     <l n="3433">Think not , revolted Spirit , thy shape the same ,</l>
     <l n="3434">Or undiminished brightness to be known ,</l>
     <l n="3435">As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure ;</l>
     <l n="3436">That glory then , when thou no more wast good ,</l>
     <l n="3437">Departed from thee ; and thou resemblest now</l>
     <l n="3438">Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul .</l>
     <l n="3439">But come , for thou , be sure , shalt give account</l>
     <l n="3440">To him who sent us , whose charge is to keep</l>
     <l n="3441">This place inviolable , and these from harm .</l>
     <l n="3442">So spake the Cherub ; and his grave rebuke ,</l>
     <l n="3443">Severe in youthful beauty , added grace</l>
     <l n="3444">Invincible : Abashed the Devil stood ,</l>
     <l n="3445">And felt how awful goodness is , and saw</l>
     <l n="3446">Virtue in her shape how lovely ; saw , and pined</l>
     <l n="3447">His loss ; but chiefly to find here observed</l>
     <l n="3448">His lustre visibly impaired ; yet seemed</l>
     <l n="3449">Undaunted . If I must contend , said he ,</l>
     <l n="3450">Best with the best , the sender , not the sent ,</l>
     <l n="3451">Or all at once ; more glory will be won ,</l>
     <l n="3452">Or less be lost . Thy fear , said Zephon bold ,</l>
     <l n="3453">Will save us trial what the least can do</l>
     <l n="3454">Single against thee wicked , and thence weak .</l>
     <l n="3455">The Fiend replied not , overcome with rage ;</l>
     <l n="3456">But , like a proud steed reined , went haughty on ,</l>
     <l n="3457">Champing his iron curb : To strive or fly</l>
     <l n="3458">He held it vain ; awe from above had quelled</l>
     <l n="3459">His heart , not else dismayed . Now drew they nigh</l>
     <l n="3460">The western point , where those half-rounding guards</l>
     <l n="3461">Just met , and closing stood in squadron joined ,</l>
     <l n="3462">A waiting next command . To whom their Chief ,</l>
     <l n="3463">Gabriel , from the front thus called aloud .</l>
     <l n="3464">O friends ! I hear the tread of nimble feet</l>
     <l n="3465">Hasting this way , and now by glimpse discern</l>
     <l n="3466">Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade ;</l>
     <l n="3467">And with them comes a third of regal port ,</l>
     <l n="3468">But faded splendour wan ; who by his gait</l>
     <l n="3469">And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell ,</l>
     <l n="3470">Not likely to part hence without contest ;</l>
     <l n="3471">Stand firm , for in his look defiance lours .</l>
     <l n="3472">He scarce had ended , when those two approached ,</l>
     <l n="3473">And brief related whom they brought , where found ,</l>
     <l n="3474">How busied , in what form and posture couched .</l>
     <l n="3475">To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake .</l>
     <l n="3476">Why hast thou , Satan , broke the bounds prescribed</l>
     <l n="3477">To thy transgressions , and disturbed the charge</l>
     <l n="3478">Of others , who approve not to transgress</l>
     <l n="3479">By thy example , but have power and right</l>
     <l n="3480">To question thy bold entrance on this place ;</l>
     <l n="3481">Employed , it seems , to violate sleep , and those</l>
     <l n="3482">Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss !</l>
     <l n="3483">To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow .</l>
     <l n="3484">Gabriel ? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise ,</l>
     <l n="3485">And such I held thee ; but this question asked</l>
     <l n="3486">Puts me in doubt . Lives there who loves his pain !</l>
     <l n="3487">Who would not , finding way , break loose from Hell ,</l>
     <l n="3488">Though thither doomed ! Thou wouldst thyself , no doubt</l>
     <l n="3489">And boldly venture to whatever place</l>
     <l n="3490">Farthest from pain , where thou mightst hope to change</l>
     <l n="3491">Torment with ease , and soonest recompense</l>
     <l n="3492">Dole with delight , which in this place I sought ;</l>
     <l n="3493">To thee no reason , who knowest only good ,</l>
     <l n="3494">But evil hast not tried : and wilt object</l>
     <l n="3495">His will who bounds us ! Let him surer bar</l>
     <l n="3496">His iron gates , if he intends our stay</l>
     <l n="3497">In that dark durance : Thus much what was asked .</l>
     <l n="3498">The rest is true , they found me where they say ;</l>
     <l n="3499">But that implies not violence or harm .</l>
     <l n="3500">Thus he in scorn . The warlike Angel moved ,</l>
     <l n="3501">Disdainfully half smiling , thus replied .</l>
     <l n="3502">O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise</l>
     <l n="3503">Since Satan fell , whom folly overthrew ,</l>
     <l n="3504">And now returns him from his prison ‘ scaped ,</l>
     <l n="3505">Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise</l>
     <l n="3506">Or not , who ask what boldness brought him hither</l>
     <l n="3507">Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed ;</l>
     <l n="3508">So wise he judges it to fly from pain</l>
     <l n="3509">However , and to ‘ scape his punishment !</l>
     <l n="3510">So judge thou still , presumptuous ! till the wrath ,</l>
     <l n="3511">Which thou incurrest by flying , meet thy flight</l>
     <l n="3512">Sevenfold , and scourge that wisdom back to Hell ,</l>
     <l n="3513">Which taught thee yet no better , that no pain</l>
     <l n="3514">Can equal anger infinite provoked .</l>
     <l n="3515">But wherefore thou alone ? wherefore with thee</l>
     <l n="3516">Came not all hell broke loose ? or thou than they</l>
     <l n="3517">Less hardy to endure ? Courageous Chief !</l>
     <l n="3518">The first in flight from pain ! hadst thou alleged</l>
     <l n="3519">To thy deserted host this cause of flight ,</l>
     <l n="3520">Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive .</l>
     <l n="3521">To which the Fiend thus answered , frowning stern .</l>
     <l n="3522">Not that I less endure , or shrink from pain ,</l>
     <l n="3523">Insulting Angel ! well thou knowest I stood</l>
     <l n="3524">Thy fiercest , when in battle to thy aid</l>
     <l n="3525">The blasting vollied thunder made all speed ,</l>
     <l n="3526">And seconded thy else not dreaded spear .</l>
     <l n="3527">But still thy words at random , as before ,</l>
     <l n="3528">Argue thy inexperience what behoves</l>
     <l n="3529">From hard assays and ill successes past</l>
     <l n="3530">A faithful leader , not to hazard all</l>
     <l n="3531">Through ways of danger by himself untried :</l>
     <l n="3532">I , therefore , I alone first undertook</l>
     <l n="3533">To wing the desolate abyss , and spy</l>
     <l n="3534">This new created world , whereof in Hell</l>
     <l n="3535">Fame is not silent , here in hope to find</l>
     <l n="3536">Better abode , and my afflicted Powers</l>
     <l n="3537">To settle here on earth , or in mid air ;</l>
     <l n="3538">Though for possession put to try once more</l>
     <l n="3539">What thou and thy gay legions dare against ;</l>
     <l n="3540">Whose easier business were to serve their Lord</l>
     <l n="3541">High up in Heaven , with songs to hymn his throne ,</l>
     <l n="3542">And practised distances to cringe , not fight ,</l>
     <l n="3543">To whom the warriour Angel soon replied .</l>
     <l n="3544">To say and straight unsay , pretending first</l>
     <l n="3545">Wise to fly pain , professing next the spy ,</l>
     <l n="3546">Argues no leader but a liar traced ,</l>
     <l n="3547">Satan , and couldst thou faithful add ? O name ,</l>
     <l n="3548">O sacred name of faithfulness profaned !</l>
     <l n="3549">Faithful to whom ? to thy rebellious crew ?</l>
     <l n="3550">Army of Fiends , fit body to fit head .</l>
     <l n="3551">Was this your discipline and faith engaged ,</l>
     <l n="3552">Your military obedience , to dissolve</l>
     <l n="3553">Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme ?</l>
     <l n="3554">And thou , sly hypocrite , who now wouldst seem</l>
     <l n="3555">Patron of liberty , who more than thou</l>
     <l n="3556">Once fawned , and cringed , and servilely adored</l>
     <l n="3557">Heaven 's awful Monarch ? wherefore , but in hope</l>
     <l n="3558">To dispossess him , and thyself to reign ?</l>
     <l n="3559">But mark what I arreed thee now , Avant ;</l>
     <l n="3560">Fly neither whence thou fledst ! If from this hour</l>
     <l n="3561">Within these hallowed limits thou appear ,</l>
     <l n="3562">Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained ,</l>
     <l n="3563">And seal thee so , as henceforth not to scorn</l>
     <l n="3564">The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred .</l>
     <l n="3565">So threatened he ; but Satan to no threats</l>
     <l n="3566">Gave heed , but waxing more in rage replied .</l>
     <l n="3567">Then when I am thy captive talk of chains ,</l>
     <l n="3568">Proud limitary Cherub ! but ere then</l>
     <l n="3569">Far heavier load thyself expect to feel</l>
     <l n="3570">From my prevailing arm , though Heaven 's King</l>
     <l n="3571">Ride on thy wings , and thou with thy compeers ,</l>
     <l n="3572">Us 'd to the yoke , drawest his triumphant wheels</l>
     <l n="3573">In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved .</l>
     <l n="3574">While thus he spake , the angelick squadron bright</l>
     <l n="3575">Turned fiery red , sharpening in mooned horns</l>
     <l n="3576">Their phalanx , and began to hem him round</l>
     <l n="3577">With ported spears , as thick as when a field</l>
     <l n="3578">Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends</l>
     <l n="3579">Her bearded grove of ears , which way the wind</l>
     <l n="3580">Sways them ; the careful plowman doubting stands ,</l>
     <l n="3581">Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves</l>
     <l n="3582">Prove chaff . On the other side , Satan , alarmed ,</l>
     <l n="3583">Collecting all his might , dilated stood ,</l>
     <l n="3584">Like Teneriff or Atlas , unremoved :</l>
     <l n="3585">His stature reached the sky , and on his crest</l>
     <l n="3586">Sat Horrour plumed ; nor wanted in his grasp</l>
     <l n="3587">What seemed both spear and shield : Now dreadful deeds</l>
     <l n="3588">Might have ensued , nor only Paradise</l>
     <l n="3589">In this commotion , but the starry cope</l>
     <l n="3590">Of Heaven perhaps , or all the elements</l>
     <l n="3591">At least had gone to wrack , disturbed and torn</l>
     <l n="3592">With violence of this conflict , had not soon</l>
     <l n="3593">The Eternal , to prevent such horrid fray ,</l>
     <l n="3594">Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales , yet seen</l>
     <l n="3595">Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign ,</l>
     <l n="3596">Wherein all things created first he weighed ,</l>
     <l n="3597">The pendulous round earth with balanced air</l>
     <l n="3598">In counterpoise , now ponders all events ,</l>
     <l n="3599">Battles and realms : In these he put two weights ,</l>
     <l n="3600">The sequel each of parting and of fight :</l>
     <l n="3601">The latter quick up flew , and kicked the beam ,</l>
     <l n="3602">Which Gabriel spying , thus bespake the Fiend .</l>
     <l n="3603">Satan , I know thy strength , and thou knowest mine ;</l>
     <l n="3604">Neither our own , but given : What folly then</l>
     <l n="3605">To boast what arms can do ? since thine no more</l>
     <l n="3606">Than Heaven permits , nor mine , though doubled now</l>
     <l n="3607">To trample thee as mire : For proof look up ,</l>
     <l n="3608">And read thy lot in yon celestial sign ;</l>
     <l n="3609">Where thou art weighed , and shown how light , how weak ,</l>
     <l n="3610">If thou resist . The Fiend looked up , and knew</l>
     <l n="3611">His mounted scale aloft : Nor more ; but fled</l>
     <l n="3612">Murmuring , and with him fled the shades of night .</l>

     <l n="3614">Now Morn , her rosy steps in the eastern clime</l>
     <l n="3615">Advancing , sowed the earth with orient pearl ,</l>
     <l n="3616">When Adam waked , so customed ; for his sleep</l>
     <l n="3617">Was aery-light , from pure digestion bred ,</l>
     <l n="3618">And temperate vapours bland , which the only sound</l>
     <l n="3619">Of leaves and fuming rills , Aurora 's fan ,</l>
     <l n="3620">Lightly dispersed , and the shrill matin song</l>
     <l n="3621">Of birds on every bough ; so much the more</l>
     <l n="3622">His wonder was to find unwakened Eve</l>
     <l n="3623">With tresses discomposed , and glowing cheek ,</l>
     <l n="3624">As through unquiet rest : He , on his side</l>
     <l n="3625">Leaning half raised , with looks of cordial love</l>
     <l n="3626">Hung over her enamoured , and beheld</l>
     <l n="3627">Beauty , which , whether waking or asleep ,</l>
     <l n="3628">Shot forth peculiar graces ; then with voice</l>
     <l n="3629">Mild , as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes ,</l>
     <l n="3630">Her hand soft touching , whispered thus . Awake ,</l>
     <l n="3631">My fairest , my espoused , my latest found ,</l>
     <l n="3632">Heaven 's last best gift , my ever new delight !</l>
     <l n="3633">Awake : The morning shines , and the fresh field</l>
     <l n="3634">Calls us ; we lose the prime , to mark how spring</l>
     <l n="3635">Our tender plants , how blows the citron grove ,</l>
     <l n="3636">What drops the myrrh , and what the balmy reed ,</l>
     <l n="3637">How nature paints her colours , how the bee</l>
     <l n="3638">Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet .</l>
     <l n="3639">Such whispering waked her , but with startled eye</l>
     <l n="3640">On Adam , whom embracing , thus she spake .</l>
     <l n="3641">O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose ,</l>
     <l n="3642">My glory , my perfection ! glad I see</l>
     <l n="3643">Thy face , and morn returned ; for I this night</l>
     <l n="3644">( Such night till this I never passed ) have dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="3645">If dreamed , not , as I oft am wont , of thee ,</l>
     <l n="3646">Works of day past , or morrow 's next design ,</l>
     <l n="3647">But of offence and trouble , which my mind</l>
     <l n="3648">Knew never till this irksome night : Methought ,</l>
     <l n="3649">Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk</l>
     <l n="3650">With gentle voice ; I thought it thine : It said ,</l>
     <l n="3651">“ Why sleepest thou , Eve ? now is the pleasant time ,</l>
     <l n="3652">The cool , the silent , save where silence yields</l>
     <l n="3653">To the night-warbling bird , that now awake</l>
     <l n="3654">Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song ; now reigns</l>
     <l n="3655">Full-orbed the moon , and with more pleasing light</l>
     <l n="3656">Shadowy sets off the face of things ; in vain ,</l>
     <l n="3657">If none regard ; Heaven wakes with all his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="3658">Whom to behold but thee , Nature 's desire ?</l>
     <l n="3659">In whose sight all things joy , with ravishment</l>
     <l n="3660">Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze . ”</l>
     <l n="3661">I rose as at thy call , but found thee not ;</l>
     <l n="3662">To find thee I directed then my walk ;</l>
     <l n="3663">And on , methought , alone I passed through ways</l>
     <l n="3664">That brought me on a sudden to the tree</l>
     <l n="3665">Of interdicted knowledge : fair it seemed ,</l>
     <l n="3666">Much fairer to my fancy than by day :</l>
     <l n="3667">And , as I wondering looked , beside it stood</l>
     <l n="3668">One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven</l>
     <l n="3669">By us oft seen ; his dewy locks distilled</l>
     <l n="3670">Ambrosia ; on that tree he also gazed ;</l>
     <l n="3671">And “ O fair plant , ” said he , “ with fruit surcharged ,</l>
     <l n="3672">Deigns none to ease thy load , and taste thy sweet ,</l>
     <l n="3673">Nor God , nor Man ? Is knowledge so despised ?</l>
     <l n="3674">Or envy , or what reserve forbids to taste ?</l>
     <l n="3675">Forbid who will , none shall from me withhold</l>
     <l n="3676">Longer thy offered good ; why else set here ? ”</l>
     <l n="3677">This said , he paused not , but with venturous arm</l>
     <l n="3678">He plucked , he tasted ; me damp horrour chilled</l>
     <l n="3679">At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold :</l>
     <l n="3680">But he thus , overjoyed ; “ O fruit divine ,</l>
     <l n="3681">Sweet of thyself , but much more sweet thus cropt ,</l>
     <l n="3682">Forbidden here , it seems , as only fit</l>
     <l n="3683">For Gods , yet able to make Gods of Men :</l>
     <l n="3684">And why not Gods of Men ; since good , the more</l>
     <l n="3685">Communicated , more abundant grows ,</l>
     <l n="3686">The author not impaired , but honoured more ?</l>
     <l n="3687">Here , happy creature , fair angelick Eve !</l>
     <l n="3688">Partake thou also ; happy though thou art ,</l>
     <l n="3689">Happier thou mayest be , worthier canst not be :</l>
     <l n="3690">Taste this , and be henceforth among the Gods</l>
     <l n="3691">Thyself a Goddess , not to earth confined ,</l>
     <l n="3692">But sometimes in the air , as we , sometimes</l>
     <l n="3693">Ascend to Heaven , by merit thine , and see</l>
     <l n="3694">What life the Gods live there , and such live thou ! ”</l>
     <l n="3695">So saying , he drew nigh , and to me held ,</l>
     <l n="3696">Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part</l>
     <l n="3697">Which he had plucked ; the pleasant savoury smell</l>
     <l n="3698">So quickened appetite , that I , methought ,</l>
     <l n="3699">Could not but taste . Forthwith up to the clouds</l>
     <l n="3700">With him I flew , and underneath beheld</l>
     <l n="3701">The earth outstretched immense , a prospect wide</l>
     <l n="3702">And various : Wondering at my flight and change</l>
     <l n="3703">To this high exaltation ; suddenly</l>
     <l n="3704">My guide was gone , and I , methought , sunk down ,</l>
     <l n="3705">And fell asleep ; but O , how glad I waked</l>
     <l n="3706">To find this but a dream ! Thus Eve her night</l>
     <l n="3707">Related , and thus Adam answered sad .</l>
     <l n="3708">Best image of myself , and dearer half ,</l>
     <l n="3709">The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep</l>
     <l n="3710">Affects me equally ; nor can I like</l>
     <l n="3711">This uncouth dream , of evil sprung , I fear ;</l>
     <l n="3712">Yet evil whence ? in thee can harbour none ,</l>
     <l n="3713">Created pure . But know that in the soul</l>
     <l n="3714">Are many lesser faculties , that serve</l>
     <l n="3715">Reason as chief ; among these Fancy next</l>
     <l n="3716">Her office holds ; of all external things</l>
     <l n="3717">Which the five watchful senses represent ,</l>
     <l n="3718">She forms imaginations , aery shapes ,</l>
     <l n="3719">Which Reason , joining or disjoining , frames</l>
     <l n="3720">All what we affirm or what deny , and call</l>
     <l n="3721">Our knowledge or opinion ; then retires</l>
     <l n="3722">Into her private cell , when nature rests .</l>
     <l n="3723">Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes</l>
     <l n="3724">To imitate her ; but , misjoining shapes ,</l>
     <l n="3725">Wild work produces oft , and most in dreams ;</l>
     <l n="3726">Ill matching words and deeds long past or late .</l>
     <l n="3727">Some such resemblances , methinks , I find</l>
     <l n="3728">Of our last evening 's talk , in this thy dream ,</l>
     <l n="3729">But with addition strange ; yet be not sad .</l>
     <l n="3730">Evil into the mind of God or Man</l>
     <l n="3731">May come and go , so unreproved , and leave</l>
     <l n="3732">No spot or blame behind : Which gives me hope</l>
     <l n="3733">That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream ,</l>
     <l n="3734">Waking thou never will consent to do .</l>
     <l n="3735">Be not disheartened then , nor cloud those looks ,</l>
     <l n="3736">That wont to be more cheerful and serene ,</l>
     <l n="3737">Than when fair morning first smiles on the world ;</l>
     <l n="3738">And let us to our fresh employments rise</l>
     <l n="3739">Among the groves , the fountains , and the flowers</l>
     <l n="3740">That open now their choisest bosomed smells ,</l>
     <l n="3741">Reserved from night , and kept for thee in store .</l>
     <l n="3742">So cheered he his fair spouse , and she was cheered ;</l>
     <l n="3743">But silently a gentle tear let fall</l>
     <l n="3744">From either eye , and wiped them with her hair ;</l>
     <l n="3745">Two other precious drops that ready stood ,</l>
     <l n="3746">Each in their crystal sluice , he ere they fell</l>
     <l n="3747">Kissed , as the gracious signs of sweet remorse</l>
     <l n="3748">And pious awe , that feared to have offended .</l>
     <l n="3749">So all was cleared , and to the field they haste .</l>
     <l n="3750">But first , from under shady arborous roof</l>
     <l n="3751">Soon as they forth were come to open sight</l>
     <l n="3752">Of day-spring , and the sun , who , scarce up-risen ,</l>
     <l n="3753">With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim ,</l>
     <l n="3754">Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray ,</l>
     <l n="3755">Discovering in wide landskip all the east</l>
     <l n="3756">Of Paradise and Eden 's happy plains ,</l>
     <l n="3757">Lowly they bowed adoring , and began</l>
     <l n="3758">Their orisons , each morning duly paid</l>
     <l n="3759">In various style ; for neither various style</l>
     <l n="3760">Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise</l>
     <l n="3761">Their Maker , in fit strains pronounced , or sung</l>
     <l n="3762">Unmeditated ; such prompt eloquence</l>
     <l n="3763">Flowed from their lips , in prose or numerous verse ,</l>
     <l n="3764">More tuneable than needed lute or harp</l>
     <l n="3765">To add more sweetness ; and they thus began .</l>
     <l n="3766">These are thy glorious works , Parent of good ,</l>
     <l n="3767">Almighty ! Thine this universal frame ,</l>
     <l n="3768">Thus wonderous fair ; Thyself how wonderous then !</l>
     <l n="3769">Unspeakable , who sitst above these heavens</l>
     <l n="3770">To us invisible , or dimly seen</l>
     <l n="3771">In these thy lowest works ; yet these declare</l>
     <l n="3772">Thy goodness beyond thought , and power divine .</l>
     <l n="3773">Speak , ye who best can tell , ye sons of light ,</l>
     <l n="3774">Angels ; for ye behold him , and with songs</l>
     <l n="3775">And choral symphonies , day without night ,</l>
     <l n="3776">Circle his throne rejoicing ; ye in Heaven</l>
     <l n="3777">On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol</l>
     <l n="3778">Him first , him last , him midst , and without end .</l>
     <l n="3779">Fairest of stars , last in the train of night ,</l>
     <l n="3780">If better thou belong not to the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="3781">Sure pledge of day , that crownest the smiling morn</l>
     <l n="3782">With thy bright circlet , praise him in thy sphere ,</l>
     <l n="3783">While day arises , that sweet hour of prime .</l>
     <l n="3784">Thou Sun , of this great world both eye and soul ,</l>
     <l n="3785">Acknowledge him thy greater ; sound his praise</l>
     <l n="3786">In thy eternal course , both when thou climbest ,</l>
     <l n="3787">And when high noon hast gained , and when thou fallest .</l>
     <l n="3788">Moon , that now meetest the orient sun , now flyest ,</l>
     <l n="3789">With the fixed Stars , fixed in their orb that flies ;</l>
     <l n="3790">And ye five other wandering Fires , that move</l>
     <l n="3791">In mystick dance not without song , resound</l>
     <l n="3792">His praise , who out of darkness called up light .</l>
     <l n="3793">Air , and ye Elements , the eldest birth</l>
     <l n="3794">Of Nature 's womb , that in quaternion run</l>
     <l n="3795">Perpetual circle , multiform ; and mix</l>
     <l n="3796">And nourish all things ; let your ceaseless change</l>
     <l n="3797">Vary to our great Maker still new praise .</l>
     <l n="3798">Ye Mists and Exhalations , that now rise</l>
     <l n="3799">From hill or steaming lake , dusky or gray ,</l>
     <l n="3800">Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold ,</l>
     <l n="3801">In honour to the world 's great Author rise ;</l>
     <l n="3802">Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky ,</l>
     <l n="3803">Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers ,</l>
     <l n="3804">Rising or falling still advance his praise .</l>
     <l n="3805">His praise , ye Winds , that from four quarters blow ,</l>
     <l n="3806">Breathe soft or loud ; and , wave your tops , ye Pines ,</l>
     <l n="3807">With every plant , in sign of worship wave .</l>
     <l n="3808">Fountains , and ye that warble , as ye flow ,</l>
     <l n="3809">Melodious murmurs , warbling tune his praise .</l>
     <l n="3810">Join voices , all ye living Souls : Ye Birds ,</l>
     <l n="3811">That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend ,</l>
     <l n="3812">Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise .</l>
     <l n="3813">Ye that in waters glide , and ye that walk</l>
     <l n="3814">The earth , and stately tread , or lowly creep ;</l>
     <l n="3815">Witness if I be silent , morn or even ,</l>
     <l n="3816">To hill , or valley , fountain , or fresh shade ,</l>
     <l n="3817">Made vocal by my song , and taught his praise .</l>
     <l n="3818">Hail , universal Lord , be bounteous still</l>
     <l n="3819">To give us only good ; and if the night</l>
     <l n="3820">Have gathered aught of evil , or concealed ,</l>
     <l n="3821">Disperse it , as now light dispels the dark !</l>
     <l n="3822">So prayed they innocent , and to their thoughts</l>
     <l n="3823">Firm peace recovered soon , and wonted calm .</l>
     <l n="3824">On to their morning 's rural work they haste ,</l>
     <l n="3825">Among sweet dews and flowers ; where any row</l>
     <l n="3826">Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far</l>
     <l n="3827">Their pampered boughs , and needed hands to check</l>
     <l n="3828">Fruitless embraces : or they led the vine</l>
     <l n="3829">To wed her elm ; she , spoused , about him twines</l>
     <l n="3830">Her marriageable arms , and with him brings</l>
     <l n="3831">Her dower , the adopted clusters , to adorn</l>
     <l n="3832">His barren leaves . Them thus employed beheld</l>
     <l n="3833">With pity Heaven 's high King , and to him called</l>
     <l n="3834">Raphael , the sociable Spirit , that deigned</l>
     <l n="3835">To travel with Tobias , and secured</l>
     <l n="3836">His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid .</l>
     <l n="3837">Raphael , said he , thou hearest what stir on Earth</l>
     <l n="3838">Satan , from Hell ‘ scaped through the darksome gulf ,</l>
     <l n="3839">Hath raised in Paradise ; and how disturbed</l>
     <l n="3840">This night the human pair ; how he designs</l>
     <l n="3841">In them at once to ruin all mankind .</l>
     <l n="3842">Go therefore , half this day as friend with friend</l>
     <l n="3843">Converse with Adam , in what bower or shade</l>
     <l n="3844">Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired ,</l>
     <l n="3845">To respite his day-labour with repast ,</l>
     <l n="3846">Or with repose ; and such discourse bring on ,</l>
     <l n="3847">As may advise him of his happy state ,</l>
     <l n="3848">Happiness in his power left free to will ,</l>
     <l n="3849">Left to his own free will , his will though free ,</l>
     <l n="3850">Yet mutable ; whence warn him to beware</l>
     <l n="3851">He swerve not , too secure : Tell him withal</l>
     <l n="3852">His danger , and from whom ; what enemy ,</l>
     <l n="3853">Late fallen himself from Heaven , is plotting now</l>
     <l n="3854">The fall of others from like state of bliss ;</l>
     <l n="3855">By violence ? no , for that shall be withstood ;</l>
     <l n="3856">But by deceit and lies : This let him know ,</l>
     <l n="3857">Lest , wilfully transgressing , he pretend</l>
     <l n="3858">Surprisal , unadmonished , unforewarned .</l>
     <l n="3859">So spake the Eternal Father , and fulfilled</l>
     <l n="3860">All justice : Nor delayed the winged Saint</l>
     <l n="3861">After his charge received ; but from among</l>
     <l n="3862">Thousand celestial Ardours , where he stood</l>
     <l n="3863">Veiled with his gorgeous wings , up springing light ,</l>
     <l n="3864">Flew through the midst of Heaven ; the angelick quires ,</l>
     <l n="3865">On each hand parting , to his speed gave way</l>
     <l n="3866">Through all the empyreal road ; till , at the gate</l>
     <l n="3867">Of Heaven arrived , the gate self-opened wide</l>
     <l n="3868">On golden hinges turning , as by work</l>
     <l n="3869">Divine the sovran Architect had framed .</l>
     <l n="3870">From hence no cloud , or , to obstruct his sight ,</l>
     <l n="3871">Star interposed , however small he sees ,</l>
     <l n="3872">Not unconformed to other shining globes ,</l>
     <l n="3873">Earth , and the garden of God , with cedars crowned</l>
     <l n="3874">Above all hills . As when by night the glass</l>
     <l n="3875">Of Galileo , less assured , observes</l>
     <l n="3876">Imagined lands and regions in the moon :</l>
     <l n="3877">Or pilot , from amidst the Cyclades</l>
     <l n="3878">Delos or Samos first appearing , kens</l>
     <l n="3879">A cloudy spot . Down thither prone in flight</l>
     <l n="3880">He speeds , and through the vast ethereal sky</l>
     <l n="3881">Sails between worlds and worlds , with steady wing</l>
     <l n="3882">Now on the polar winds , then with quick fan</l>
     <l n="3883">Winnows the buxom air ; till , within soar</l>
     <l n="3884">Of towering eagles , to all the fowls he seems</l>
     <l n="3885">A phoenix , gazed by all as that sole bird ,</l>
     <l n="3886">When , to enshrine his reliques in the Sun 's</l>
     <l n="3887">Bright temple , to Egyptian Thebes he flies .</l>
     <l n="3888">At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise</l>
     <l n="3889">He lights , and to his proper shape returns</l>
     <l n="3890">A Seraph winged : Six wings he wore , to shade</l>
     <l n="3891">His lineaments divine ; the pair that clad</l>
     <l n="3892">Each shoulder broad , came mantling o'er his breast</l>
     <l n="3893">With regal ornament ; the middle pair</l>
     <l n="3894">Girt like a starry zone his waist , and round</l>
     <l n="3895">Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold</l>
     <l n="3896">And colours dipt in Heaven ; the third his feet</l>
     <l n="3897">Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail ,</l>
     <l n="3898">Sky-tinctured grain . Like Maia 's son he stood ,</l>
     <l n="3899">And shook his plumes , that heavenly fragrance filled</l>
     <l n="3900">The circuit wide . Straight knew him all the bands</l>
     <l n="3901">Of Angels under watch ; and to his state ,</l>
     <l n="3902">And to his message high , in honour rise ;</l>
     <l n="3903">For on some message high they guessed him bound .</l>
     <l n="3904">Their glittering tents he passed , and now is come</l>
     <l n="3905">Into the blissful field , through groves of myrrh ,</l>
     <l n="3906">And flowering odours , cassia , nard , and balm ;</l>
     <l n="3907">A wilderness of sweets ; for Nature here</l>
     <l n="3908">Wantoned as in her prime , and played at will</l>
     <l n="3909">Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet ,</l>
     <l n="3910">Wild above rule or art , enormous bliss .</l>
     <l n="3911">Him through the spicy forest onward come</l>
     <l n="3912">Adam discerned , as in the door he sat</l>
     <l n="3913">Of his cool bower , while now the mounted sun</l>
     <l n="3914">Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm</l>
     <l n="3915">Earth 's inmost womb , more warmth than Adam needs :</l>
     <l n="3916">And Eve within , due at her hour prepared</l>
     <l n="3917">For dinner savoury fruits , of taste to please</l>
     <l n="3918">True appetite , and not disrelish thirst</l>
     <l n="3919">Of nectarous draughts between , from milky stream ,</l>
     <l n="3920">Berry or grape : To whom thus Adam called .</l>
     <l n="3921">Haste hither , Eve , and worth thy sight behold</l>
     <l n="3922">Eastward among those trees , what glorious shape</l>
     <l n="3923">Comes this way moving ; seems another morn</l>
     <l n="3924">Risen on mid-noon ; some great behest from Heaven</l>
     <l n="3925">To us perhaps he brings , and will vouchsafe</l>
     <l n="3926">This day to be our guest . But go with speed ,</l>
     <l n="3927">And , what thy stores contain , bring forth , and pour</l>
     <l n="3928">Abundance , fit to honour and receive</l>
     <l n="3929">Our heavenly stranger : Well we may afford</l>
     <l n="3930">Our givers their own gifts , and large bestow</l>
     <l n="3931">From large bestowed , where Nature multiplies</l>
     <l n="3932">Her fertile growth , and by disburthening grows</l>
     <l n="3933">More fruitful , which instructs us not to spare .</l>
     <l n="3934">To whom thus Eve . Adam , earth 's hallowed mould ,</l>
     <l n="3935">Of God inspired ! small store will serve , where store ,</l>
     <l n="3936">All seasons , ripe for use hangs on the stalk ;</l>
     <l n="3937">Save what by frugal storing firmness gains</l>
     <l n="3938">To nourish , and superfluous moist consumes :</l>
     <l n="3939">But I will haste , and from each bough and brake ,</l>
     <l n="3940">Each plant and juciest gourd , will pluck such choice</l>
     <l n="3941">To entertain our Angel-guest , as he</l>
     <l n="3942">Beholding shall confess , that here on Earth</l>
     <l n="3943">God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven .</l>
     <l n="3944">So saying , with dispatchful looks in haste</l>
     <l n="3945">She turns , on hospitable thoughts intent</l>
     <l n="3946">What choice to choose for delicacy best ,</l>
     <l n="3947">What order , so contrived as not to mix</l>
     <l n="3948">Tastes , not well joined , inelegant , but bring</l>
     <l n="3949">Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change ;</l>
     <l n="3950">Bestirs her then , and from each tender stalk</l>
     <l n="3951">Whatever Earth , all-bearing mother , yields</l>
     <l n="3952">In India East or West , or middle shore</l>
     <l n="3953">In Pontus or the Punick coast , or where</l>
     <l n="3954">Alcinous reigned , fruit of all kinds , in coat</l>
     <l n="3955">Rough , or smooth rind , or bearded husk , or shell ,</l>
     <l n="3956">She gathers , tribute large , and on the board</l>
     <l n="3957">Heaps with unsparing hand ; for drink the grape</l>
     <l n="3958">She crushes , inoffensive must , and meaths</l>
     <l n="3959">From many a berry , and from sweet kernels pressed</l>
     <l n="3960">She tempers dulcet creams ; nor these to hold</l>
     <l n="3961">Wants her fit vessels pure ; then strows the ground</l>
     <l n="3962">With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed .</l>
     <l n="3963">Mean while our primitive great sire , to meet</l>
     <l n="3964">His God-like guest , walks forth , without more train</l>
     <l n="3965">Accompanied than with his own complete</l>
     <l n="3966">Perfections ; in himself was all his state ,</l>
     <l n="3967">More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits</l>
     <l n="3968">On princes , when their rich retinue long</l>
     <l n="3969">Of horses led , and grooms besmeared with gold ,</l>
     <l n="3970">Dazzles the croud , and sets them all agape .</l>
     <l n="3971">Nearer his presence Adam , though not awed ,</l>
     <l n="3972">Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek ,</l>
     <l n="3973">As to a superiour nature bowing low ,</l>
     <l n="3974">Thus said . Native of Heaven , for other place</l>
     <l n="3975">None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain ;</l>
     <l n="3976">Since , by descending from the thrones above ,</l>
     <l n="3977">Those happy places thou hast deigned a while</l>
     <l n="3978">To want , and honour these , vouchsafe with us</l>
     <l n="3979">Two only , who yet by sovran gift possess</l>
     <l n="3980">This spacious ground , in yonder shady bower</l>
     <l n="3981">To rest ; and what the garden choicest bears</l>
     <l n="3982">To sit and taste , till this meridian heat</l>
     <l n="3983">Be over , and the sun more cool decline .</l>
     <l n="3984">Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild .</l>
     <l n="3985">Adam , I therefore came ; nor art thou such</l>
     <l n="3986">Created , or such place hast here to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="3987">As may not oft invite , though Spirits of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="3988">To visit thee ; lead on then where thy bower</l>
     <l n="3989">O'ershades ; for these mid-hours , till evening rise ,</l>
     <l n="3990">I have at will . So to the sylvan lodge</l>
     <l n="3991">They came , that like Pomona 's arbour smiled ,</l>
     <l n="3992">With flowerets decked , and fragrant smells ; but Eve ,</l>
     <l n="3993">Undecked save with herself , more lovely fair</l>
     <l n="3994">Than Wood-Nymph , or the fairest Goddess feigned</l>
     <l n="3995">Of three that in mount Ida naked strove ,</l>
     <l n="3996">Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven ; no veil</l>
     <l n="3997">She needed , virtue-proof ; no thought infirm</l>
     <l n="3998">Altered her cheek . On whom the Angel Hail</l>
     <l n="3999">Bestowed , the holy salutation used</l>
     <l n="4000">Long after to blest Mary , second Eve .</l>
     <l n="4001">Hail , Mother of Mankind , whose fruitful womb</l>
     <l n="4002">Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons ,</l>
     <l n="4003">Than with these various fruits the trees of God</l>
     <l n="4004">Have heaped this table !— Raised of grassy turf</l>
     <l n="4005">Their table was , and mossy seats had round ,</l>
     <l n="4006">And on her ample square from side to side</l>
     <l n="4007">All autumn piled , though spring and autumn here</l>
     <l n="4008">Danced hand in hand . A while discourse they hold ;</l>
     <l n="4009">No fear lest dinner cool ; when thus began</l>
     <l n="4010">Our author . Heavenly stranger , please to taste</l>
     <l n="4011">These bounties , which our Nourisher , from whom</l>
     <l n="4012">All perfect good , unmeasured out , descends ,</l>
     <l n="4013">To us for food and for delight hath caused</l>
     <l n="4014">The earth to yield ; unsavoury food perhaps</l>
     <l n="4015">To spiritual natures ; only this I know ,</l>
     <l n="4016">That one celestial Father gives to all .</l>
     <l n="4017">To whom the Angel . Therefore what he gives</l>
     <l n="4018">( Whose praise be ever sung ) to Man in part</l>
     <l n="4019">Spiritual , may of purest Spirits be found</l>
     <l n="4020">No ingrateful food : And food alike those pure</l>
     <l n="4021">Intelligential substances require ,</l>
     <l n="4022">As doth your rational ; and both contain</l>
     <l n="4023">Within them every lower faculty</l>
     <l n="4024">Of sense , whereby they hear , see , smell , touch , taste ,</l>
     <l n="4025">Tasting concoct , digest , assimilate ,</l>
     <l n="4026">And corporeal to incorporeal turn .</l>
     <l n="4027">For know , whatever was created , needs</l>
     <l n="4028">To be sustained and fed : Of elements</l>
     <l n="4029">The grosser feeds the purer , earth the sea ,</l>
     <l n="4030">Earth and the sea feed air , the air those fires</l>
     <l n="4031">Ethereal , and as lowest first the moon ;</l>
     <l n="4032">Whence in her visage round those spots , unpurged</l>
     <l n="4033">Vapours not yet into her substance turned .</l>
     <l n="4034">Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale</l>
     <l n="4035">From her moist continent to higher orbs .</l>
     <l n="4036">The sun that light imparts to all , receives</l>
     <l n="4037">From all his alimental recompence</l>
     <l n="4038">In humid exhalations , and at even</l>
     <l n="4039">Sups with the ocean . Though in Heaven the trees</l>
     <l n="4040">Of life ambrosial fruitage bear , and vines</l>
     <l n="4041">Yield nectar ; though from off the boughs each morn</l>
     <l n="4042">We brush mellifluous dews , and find the ground</l>
     <l n="4043">Covered with pearly grain : Yet God hath here</l>
     <l n="4044">Varied his bounty so with new delights ,</l>
     <l n="4045">As may compare with Heaven ; and to taste</l>
     <l n="4046">Think not I shall be nice . So down they sat ,</l>
     <l n="4047">And to their viands fell ; nor seemingly</l>
     <l n="4048">The Angel , nor in mist , the common gloss</l>
     <l n="4049">Of Theologians ; but with keen dispatch</l>
     <l n="4050">Of real hunger , and concoctive heat</l>
     <l n="4051">To transubstantiate : What redounds , transpires</l>
     <l n="4052">Through Spirits with ease ; nor wonder ; if by fire</l>
     <l n="4053">Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist</l>
     <l n="4054">Can turn , or holds it possible to turn ,</l>
     <l n="4055">Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold ,</l>
     <l n="4056">As from the mine . Mean while at table Eve</l>
     <l n="4057">Ministered naked , and their flowing cups</l>
     <l n="4058">With pleasant liquours crowned : O innocence</l>
     <l n="4059">Deserving Paradise ! if ever , then ,</l>
     <l n="4060">Then had the sons of God excuse to have been</l>
     <l n="4061">Enamoured at that sight ; but in those hearts</l>
     <l n="4062">Love unlibidinous reigned , nor jealousy</l>
     <l n="4063">Was understood , the injured lover 's hell .</l>
     <l n="4064">Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed ,</l>
     <l n="4065">Not burdened nature , sudden mind arose</l>
     <l n="4066">In Adam , not to let the occasion pass</l>
     <l n="4067">Given him by this great conference to know</l>
     <l n="4068">Of things above his world , and of their being</l>
     <l n="4069">Who dwell in Heaven , whose excellence he saw</l>
     <l n="4070">Transcend his own so far ; whose radiant forms ,</l>
     <l n="4071">Divine effulgence , whose high power , so far</l>
     <l n="4072">Exceeded human ; and his wary speech</l>
     <l n="4073">Thus to the empyreal minister he framed .</l>
     <l n="4074">Inhabitant with God , now know I well</l>
     <l n="4075">Thy favour , in this honour done to Man ;</l>
     <l n="4076">Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed</l>
     <l n="4077">To enter , and these earthly fruits to taste ,</l>
     <l n="4078">Food not of Angels , yet accepted so ,</l>
     <l n="4079">As that more willingly thou couldst not seem</l>
     <l n="4080">At Heaven 's high feasts to have fed : yet what compare</l>
     <l n="4081">To whom the winged Hierarch replied .</l>
     <l n="4082">O Adam , One Almighty is , from whom</l>
     <l n="4083">All things proceed , and up to him return ,</l>
     <l n="4084">If not depraved from good , created all</l>
     <l n="4085">Such to perfection , one first matter all ,</l>
     <l n="4086">Endued with various forms , various degrees</l>
     <l n="4087">Of substance , and , in things that live , of life ;</l>
     <l n="4088">But more refined , more spiritous , and pure ,</l>

     <l n="4119">To whom the patriarch of mankind replied .</l>
     <l n="4120">O favourable Spirit , propitious guest ,</l>
     <l n="4121">Well hast thou taught the way that might direct</l>
     <l n="4122">Our knowledge , and the scale of nature set</l>
     <l n="4123">From center to circumference ; whereon ,</l>
     <l n="4124">In contemplation of created things ,</l>
     <l n="4125">By steps we may ascend to God . But say ,</l>
     <l n="4126">What meant that caution joined , If ye be found</l>
     <l n="4127">Obedient ? Can we want obedience then</l>
     <l n="4128">To him , or possibly his love desert ,</l>
     <l n="4129">Who formed us from the dust and placed us here</l>
     <l n="4130">Full to the utmost measure of what bliss</l>
     <l n="4131">Human desires can seek or apprehend ?</l>
     <l n="4132">To whom the Angel . Son of Heaven and Earth ,</l>
     <l n="4133">Attend ! That thou art happy , owe to God ;</l>
     <l n="4134">That thou continuest such , owe to thyself ,</l>
     <l n="4135">That is , to thy obedience ; therein stand .</l>
     <l n="4136">This was that caution given thee ; be advised .</l>
     <l n="4137">God made thee perfect , not immutable ;</l>
     <l n="4138">And good he made thee , but to persevere</l>
     <l n="4139">He left it in thy power ; ordained thy will</l>

     <l n="4151">On other surety none : Freely we serve ,</l>
     <l n="4152">Because we freely love , as in our will</l>
     <l n="4153">To love or not ; in this we stand or fall :</l>
     <l n="4154">And some are fallen , to disobedience fallen ,</l>
     <l n="4155">And so from Heaven to deepest Hell ; O fall</l>
     <l n="4156">From what high state of bliss , into what woe !</l>
     <l n="4157">To whom our great progenitor . Thy words</l>
     <l n="4158">Attentive , and with more delighted ear ,</l>
     <l n="4159">Divine instructer , I have heard , than when</l>
     <l n="4160">Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills</l>
     <l n="4161">Aereal musick send : Nor knew I not</l>
     <l n="4162">To be both will and deed created free ;</l>
     <l n="4163">Yet that we never shall forget to love</l>
     <l n="4164">Our Maker , and obey him whose command</l>
     <l n="4165">Single is yet so just , my constant thoughts</l>
     <l n="4166">Assured me , and still assure : Though what thou tellest</l>
     <l n="4167">Hath passed in Heaven , some doubt within me move ,</l>
     <l n="4168">But more desire to hear , if thou consent ,</l>
     <l n="4169">The full relation , which must needs be strange ,</l>
     <l n="4170">Worthy of sacred silence to be heard ;</l>
     <l n="4171">And we have yet large day , for scarce the sun</l>
     <l n="4172">Hath finished half his journey , and scarce begins</l>
     <l n="4173">His other half in the great zone of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="4174">Thus Adam made request ; and Raphael ,</l>
     <l n="4175">After short pause assenting , thus began .</l>
     <l n="4176">High matter thou enjoinest me , O prime of men ,</l>
     <l n="4177">Sad task and hard : For how shall I relate</l>
     <l n="4178">To human sense the invisible exploits</l>
     <l n="4179">Of warring Spirits ? how , without remorse ,</l>
     <l n="4180">The ruin of so many glorious once</l>
     <l n="4181">And perfect while they stood ? how last unfold</l>
     <l n="4182">The secrets of another world , perhaps</l>
     <l n="4183">Not lawful to reveal ? yet for thy good</l>
     <l n="4184">This is dispensed ; and what surmounts the reach</l>
     <l n="4185">Of human sense , I shall delineate so ,</l>
     <l n="4186">By likening spiritual to corporal forms ,</l>
     <l n="4187">As may express them best ; though what if Earth</l>
     <l n="4188">Be but a shadow of Heaven , and things therein</l>
     <l n="4189">Each to other like , more than on earth is thought ?</l>
     <l n="4190">As yet this world was not , and Chaos wild</l>
     <l n="4191">Reigned where these Heavens now roll , where Earth now rests</l>
     <l n="4192">Upon her center poised ; when on a day</l>
     <l n="4193">( For time , though in eternity , applied</l>

     <l n="4196">As Heaven 's great year brings forth , the empyreal host</l>
     <l n="4197">Of Angels by imperial summons called ,</l>
     <l n="4198">Innumerable before the Almighty 's throne</l>
     <l n="4199">Forthwith , from all the ends of Heaven , appeared</l>
     <l n="4200">Under their Hierarchs in orders bright :</l>

     <l n="4204">Of hierarchies , of orders , and degrees ;</l>
     <l n="4205">Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed</l>
     <l n="4206">Holy memorials , acts of zeal and love</l>
     <l n="4207">Recorded eminent . Thus when in orbs</l>
     <l n="4208">Of circuit inexpressible they stood ,</l>
     <l n="4209">Orb within orb , the Father Infinite ,</l>
     <l n="4210">By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son ,</l>
     <l n="4211">Amidst as from a flaming mount , whose top</l>
     <l n="4212">Brightness had made invisible , thus spake .</l>

     <l n="4216">This day I have begot whom I declare</l>
     <l n="4217">My only Son , and on this holy hill</l>
     <l n="4218">Him have anointed , whom ye now behold</l>
     <l n="4219">At my right hand ; your head I him appoint ;</l>

     <l n="4222">Under his great vice-gerent reign abide</l>
     <l n="4223">United , as one individual soul ,</l>

     <l n="4226">Cast out from God and blessed vision , falls</l>
     <l n="4227">Into utter darkness , deep ingulfed , his place</l>
     <l n="4228">Ordained without redemption , without end .</l>
     <l n="4229">So spake the Omnipotent , and with his words</l>
     <l n="4230">All seemed well pleased ; all seemed , but were not all .</l>
     <l n="4231">That day , as other solemn days , they spent</l>
     <l n="4232">In song and dance about the sacred hill ;</l>
     <l n="4233">Mystical dance , which yonder starry sphere</l>
     <l n="4234">Of planets , and of fixed , in all her wheels</l>
     <l n="4235">Resembles nearest , mazes intricate ,</l>
     <l n="4236">Eccentrick , intervolved , yet regular</l>

     <l n="4238">And in their motions harmony divine</l>

     <l n="4243">Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn</l>
     <l n="4244">Desirous ; all in circles as they stood ,</l>
     <l n="4245">Tables are set , and on a sudden piled</l>
     <l n="4246">With Angels food , and rubied nectar flows</l>
     <l n="4247">In pearl , in diamond , and massy gold ,</l>
     <l n="4248">Fruit of delicious vines , the growth of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="4249">On flowers reposed , and with fresh flowerets crowned ,</l>
     <l n="4250">They eat , they drink , and in communion sweet</l>

     <l n="4254">With copious hand , rejoicing in their joy .</l>
     <l n="4255">Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled</l>
     <l n="4256">From that high mount of God , whence light and shade</l>
     <l n="4257">Spring both , the face of brightest Heaven had changed</l>
     <l n="4258">To grateful twilight , ( for night comes not there</l>
     <l n="4259">In darker veil ) and roseate dews disposed</l>
     <l n="4260">All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest ;</l>
     <l n="4261">Wide over all the plain , and wider far</l>

     <l n="4266">Pavilions numberless , and sudden reared ,</l>
     <l n="4267">Celestial tabernacles , where they slept</l>

     <l n="4274">In favour and pre-eminence , yet fraught</l>

     <l n="4280">Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour</l>
     <l n="4281">Friendliest to sleep and silence , he resolved</l>
     <l n="4282">With all his legions to dislodge , and leave</l>
     <l n="4283">Unworshipt , unobeyed , the throne supreme ,</l>
     <l n="4284">Contemptuous ; and his next subordinate</l>
     <l n="4285">Awakening , thus to him in secret spake .</l>
     <l n="4286">Sleepest thou , Companion dear ? What sleep can close</l>
     <l n="4287">Thy eye-lids ? and rememberest what decree</l>
     <l n="4288">Of yesterday , so late hath passed the lips</l>
     <l n="4289">Of Heaven 's Almighty . Thou to me thy thoughts</l>
     <l n="4290">Wast wont , I mine to thee was wont to impart ;</l>
     <l n="4291">Both waking we were one ; how then can now</l>
     <l n="4292">Thy sleep dissent ? New laws thou seest imposed ;</l>
     <l n="4293">New laws from him who reigns , new minds may raise</l>
     <l n="4294">In us who serve , new counsels to debate</l>
     <l n="4295">What doubtful may ensue : More in this place</l>
     <l n="4296">To utter is not safe . Assemble thou</l>
     <l n="4297">Of all those myriads which we lead the chief ;</l>
     <l n="4298">Tell them , that by command , ere yet dim night</l>
     <l n="4299">Her shadowy cloud withdraws , I am to haste ,</l>
     <l n="4300">And all who under me their banners wave ,</l>
     <l n="4301">Homeward , with flying march , where we possess</l>
     <l n="4302">The quarters of the north ; there to prepare</l>
     <l n="4303">Fit entertainment to receive our King ,</l>
     <l n="4304">The great Messiah , and his new commands ,</l>
     <l n="4305">Who speedily through all the hierarchies</l>
     <l n="4306">Intends to pass triumphant , and give laws .</l>
     <l n="4307">So spake the false Arch-Angel , and infused</l>
     <l n="4308">Bad influence into the unwary breast</l>
     <l n="4309">Of his associate : He together calls ,</l>
     <l n="4310">Or several one by one , the regent Powers ,</l>
     <l n="4311">Under him Regent ; tells , as he was taught ,</l>
     <l n="4312">That the Most High commanding , now ere night ,</l>
     <l n="4313">Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="4314">The great hierarchal standard was to move ;</l>

     <l n="4316">Ambiguous words and jealousies , to sound</l>
     <l n="4317">Or taint integrity : But all obeyed</l>
     <l n="4318">The wonted signal , and superiour voice</l>
     <l n="4319">Of their great Potentate ; for great indeed</l>
     <l n="4320">His name , and high was his degree in Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="4321">His countenance , as the morning-star that guides</l>
     <l n="4322">The starry flock , allured them , and with lies</l>
     <l n="4323">Drew after him the third part of Heaven 's host .</l>
     <l n="4324">Mean while the Eternal eye , whose sight discerns</l>
     <l n="4325">Abstrusest thoughts , from forth his holy mount ,</l>
     <l n="4326">And from within the golden lamps that burn</l>
     <l n="4327">Nightly before him , saw without their light</l>
     <l n="4328">Rebellion rising ; saw in whom , how spread</l>
     <l n="4329">Among the sons of morn , what multitudes</l>
     <l n="4330">Were banded to oppose his high decree ;</l>
     <l n="4331">And , smiling , to his only Son thus said .</l>
     <l n="4332">Son , thou in whom my glory I behold</l>
     <l n="4333">In full resplendence , Heir of all my might ,</l>
     <l n="4334">Nearly it now concerns us to be sure</l>
     <l n="4335">Of our Omnipotence , and with what arms</l>
     <l n="4336">We mean to hold what anciently we claim</l>
     <l n="4337">Of deity or empire : Such a foe</l>
     <l n="4338">Is rising , who intends to erect his throne</l>
     <l n="4339">Equal to ours , throughout the spacious north ;</l>
     <l n="4340">Nor so content , hath in his thought to try</l>
     <l n="4341">In battle , what our power is , or our right .</l>
     <l n="4342">Let us advise , and to this hazard draw</l>
     <l n="4343">With speed what force is left , and all employ</l>
     <l n="4344">In our defence ; lest unawares we lose</l>
     <l n="4345">This our high place , our sanctuary , our hill .</l>
     <l n="4346">To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear ,</l>
     <l n="4347">Lightning divine , ineffable , serene ,</l>
     <l n="4348">Made answer . Mighty Father , thou thy foes</l>
     <l n="4349">Justly hast in derision , and , secure ,</l>
     <l n="4350">Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain ,</l>
     <l n="4351">Matter to me of glory , whom their hate</l>
     <l n="4352">Illustrates , when they see all regal power</l>
     <l n="4353">Given me to quell their pride , and in event</l>
     <l n="4354">Know whether I be dextrous to subdue</l>
     <l n="4355">Thy rebels , or be found the worst in Heaven .</l>
     <l n="4356">So spake the Son ; but Satan , with his Powers ,</l>
     <l n="4357">Far was advanced on winged speed ; an host</l>
     <l n="4358">Innumerable as the stars of night ,</l>

     <l n="4363">In their triple degrees ; regions to which</l>
     <l n="4364">All thy dominion , Adam , is no more</l>
     <l n="4365">Than what this garden is to all the earth ,</l>
     <l n="4366">And all the sea , from one entire globose</l>
     <l n="4367">Stretched into longitude ; which having passed ,</l>
     <l n="4368">At length into the limits of the north</l>
     <l n="4369">They came ; and Satan to his royal seat</l>
     <l n="4370">High on a hill , far blazing , as a mount</l>
     <l n="4371">Raised on a mount , with pyramids and towers</l>
     <l n="4372">From diamond quarries hewn , and rocks of gold ;</l>

     <l n="4377">In imitation of that mount whereon</l>
     <l n="4378">Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="4379">The Mountain of the Congregation called ;</l>
     <l n="4380">For thither he assembled all his train ,</l>
     <l n="4381">Pretending so commanded to consult</l>
     <l n="4382">About the great reception of their King ,</l>
     <l n="4383">Thither to come , and with calumnious art</l>
     <l n="4384">Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears .</l>
     <l n="4385">Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers ;</l>
     <l n="4386">If these magnifick titles yet remain</l>
     <l n="4387">Not merely titular , since by decree</l>
     <l n="4388">Another now hath to himself engrossed</l>
     <l n="4389">All power , and us eclipsed under the name</l>
     <l n="4390">Of King anointed , for whom all this haste</l>
     <l n="4391">Of midnight-march , and hurried meeting here ,</l>
     <l n="4392">This only to consult how we may best ,</l>
     <l n="4393">With what may be devised of honours new ,</l>
     <l n="4394">Receive him coming to receive from us</l>
     <l n="4395">Knee-tribute yet unpaid , prostration vile !</l>
     <l n="4396">Too much to one ! but double how endured ,</l>
     <l n="4397">To one , and to his image now proclaimed ?</l>
     <l n="4398">But what if better counsels might erect</l>
     <l n="4399">Our minds , and teach us to cast off this yoke ?</l>
     <l n="4400">Will ye submit your necks , and choose to bend</l>
     <l n="4401">The supple knee ? Ye will not , if I trust</l>
     <l n="4402">To know ye right , or if ye know yourselves</l>
     <l n="4403">Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before</l>
     <l n="4404">By none ; and if not equal all , yet free ,</l>
     <l n="4405">Equally free ; for orders and degrees</l>
     <l n="4406">Jar not with liberty , but well consist .</l>
     <l n="4407">Who can in reason then , or right , assume</l>
     <l n="4408">Monarchy over such as live by right</l>
     <l n="4409">His equals , if in power and splendour less ,</l>
     <l n="4410">In freedom equal ? or can introduce</l>
     <l n="4411">Law and edict on us , who without law</l>
     <l n="4412">Err not ? much less for this to be our Lord ,</l>
     <l n="4413">And look for adoration , to the abuse</l>
     <l n="4414">Of those imperial titles , which assert</l>
     <l n="4415">Our being ordained to govern , not to serve .</l>
     <l n="4416">Thus far his bold discourse without controul</l>
     <l n="4417">Had audience ; when among the Seraphim</l>
     <l n="4418">Abdiel , than whom none with more zeal adored</l>
     <l n="4419">The Deity , and divine commands obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="4420">Stood up , and in a flame of zeal severe</l>
     <l n="4421">The current of his fury thus opposed .</l>
     <l n="4422">O argument blasphemous , false , and proud !</l>
     <l n="4423">Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven</l>
     <l n="4424">Expected , least of all from thee , Ingrate ,</l>
     <l n="4425">In place thyself so high above thy peers .</l>
     <l n="4426">Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn</l>
     <l n="4427">The just decree of God , pronounced and sworn ,</l>
     <l n="4428">That to his only Son , by right endued</l>
     <l n="4429">With regal scepter , every soul in Heaven</l>
     <l n="4430">Shall bend the knee , and in that honour due</l>
     <l n="4431">Confess him rightful King ? unjust , thou sayest ,</l>
     <l n="4432">Flatly unjust , to bind with laws the free ,</l>
     <l n="4433">And equal over equals to let reign ,</l>
     <l n="4434">One over all with unsucceeded power .</l>
     <l n="4435">Shalt thou give law to God ? shalt thou dispute</l>
     <l n="4436">With him the points of liberty , who made</l>
     <l n="4437">Thee what thou art , and formed the Powers of Heaven</l>
     <l n="4438">Such as he pleased , and circumscribed their being ?</l>
     <l n="4439">Yet , by experience taught , we know how good ,</l>
     <l n="4440">And of our good and of our dignity</l>
     <l n="4441">How provident he is ; how far from thought</l>
     <l n="4442">To make us less , bent rather to exalt</l>
     <l n="4443">Our happy state , under one head more near</l>
     <l n="4444">United . But to grant it thee unjust ,</l>
     <l n="4445">That equal over equals monarch reign :</l>
     <l n="4446">Thyself , though great and glorious , dost thou count ,</l>
     <l n="4447">Or all angelick nature joined in one ,</l>
     <l n="4448">Equal to him begotten Son ? by whom ,</l>
     <l n="4449">As by his Word , the Mighty Father made</l>
     <l n="4450">All things , even thee ; and all the Spirits of Heaven</l>
     <l n="4451">By him created in their bright degrees ,</l>
     <l n="4452">Crowned them with glory , and to their glory named</l>
     <l n="4453">Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers ,</l>
     <l n="4454">Essential Powers ; nor by his reign obscured ,</l>
     <l n="4455">But more illustrious made ; since he the head</l>
     <l n="4456">One of our number thus reduced becomes ;</l>
     <l n="4457">His laws our laws ; all honour to him done</l>
     <l n="4458">Returns our own . Cease then this impious rage ,</l>
     <l n="4459">And tempt not these ; but hasten to appease</l>
     <l n="4460">The incensed Father , and the incensed Son ,</l>
     <l n="4461">While pardon may be found in time besought .</l>
     <l n="4462">So spake the fervent Angel ; but his zeal</l>
     <l n="4463">None seconded , as out of season judged ,</l>
     <l n="4464">Or singular and rash : Whereat rejoiced</l>
     <l n="4465">The Apostate , and , more haughty , thus replied .</l>
     <l n="4466">That we were formed then sayest thou ? and the work</l>
     <l n="4467">Of secondary hands , by task transferred</l>
     <l n="4468">From Father to his Son ? strange point and new !</l>
     <l n="4469">Doctrine which we would know whence learned : who saw</l>
     <l n="4470">When this creation was ? rememberest thou</l>
     <l n="4471">Thy making , while the Maker gave thee being ?</l>
     <l n="4472">We know no time when we were not as now ;</l>
     <l n="4473">Know none before us , self-begot , self-raised</l>
     <l n="4474">By our own quickening power , when fatal course</l>
     <l n="4475">Had circled his full orb , the birth mature</l>
     <l n="4476">Of this our native Heaven , ethereal sons .</l>
     <l n="4477">Our puissance is our own ; our own right hand</l>
     <l n="4478">Shall teach us highest deeds , by proof to try</l>
     <l n="4479">Who is our equal : Then thou shalt behold</l>
     <l n="4480">Whether by supplication we intend</l>
     <l n="4481">Address , and to begirt the almighty throne</l>
     <l n="4482">Beseeching or besieging . This report ,</l>
     <l n="4483">These tidings carry to the anointed King ;</l>
     <l n="4484">And fly , ere evil intercept thy flight .</l>
     <l n="4485">He said ; and , as the sound of waters deep ,</l>
     <l n="4486">Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause</l>
     <l n="4487">Through the infinite host ; nor less for that</l>
     <l n="4488">The flaming Seraph fearless , though alone</l>
     <l n="4489">Encompassed round with foes , thus answered bold .</l>
     <l n="4490">O alienate from God , O Spirit accursed ,</l>
     <l n="4491">Forsaken of all good ! I see thy fall</l>
     <l n="4492">Determined , and thy hapless crew involved</l>
     <l n="4493">In this perfidious fraud , contagion spread</l>
     <l n="4494">Both of thy crime and punishment : Henceforth</l>
     <l n="4495">No more be troubled how to quit the yoke</l>
     <l n="4496">Of God 's Messiah ; those indulgent laws</l>
     <l n="4497">Will not be now vouchsafed ; other decrees</l>
     <l n="4498">Against thee are gone forth without recall ;</l>
     <l n="4499">That golden scepter , which thou didst reject ,</l>
     <l n="4500">Is now an iron rod to bruise and break</l>
     <l n="4501">Thy disobedience . Well thou didst advise ;</l>
     <l n="4502">Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly</l>
     <l n="4503">These wicked tents devoted , lest the wrath</l>
     <l n="4504">Impendent , raging into sudden flame ,</l>
     <l n="4505">Distinguish not : For soon expect to feel</l>
     <l n="4506">His thunder on thy head , devouring fire .</l>
     <l n="4507">Then who created thee lamenting learn ,</l>
     <l n="4508">When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know .</l>
     <l n="4509">So spake the Seraph Abdiel , faithful found</l>
     <l n="4510">Among the faithless , faithful only he ;</l>
     <l n="4511">Among innumerable false , unmoved ,</l>
     <l n="4512">Unshaken , unseduced , unterrified ,</l>
     <l n="4513">His loyalty he kept , his love , his zeal ;</l>
     <l n="4514">Nor number , nor example , with him wrought</l>
     <l n="4515">To swerve from truth , or change his constant mind ,</l>
     <l n="4516">Though single . From amidst them forth he passed ,</l>
     <l n="4517">Long way through hostile scorn , which he sustained</l>
     <l n="4518">Superiour , nor of violence feared aught ;</l>
     <l n="4519">And , with retorted scorn , his back he turned</l>
     <l n="4520">On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed .</l>

     <l n="4522">All night the dreadless Angel , unpursued ,</l>
     <l n="4523">Through Heaven 's wide champain held his way ; till Morn ,</l>
     <l n="4524">Waked by the circling Hours , with rosy hand</l>
     <l n="4525">Unbarred the gates of light . There is a cave</l>
     <l n="4526">Within the mount of God , fast by his throne ,</l>
     <l n="4527">Where light and darkness in perpetual round</l>
     <l n="4528">Lodge and dislodge by turns , which makes through Heaven</l>
     <l n="4529">Grateful vicissitude , like day and night ;</l>
     <l n="4530">Light issues forth , and at the other door</l>
     <l n="4531">Obsequious darkness enters , till her hour</l>
     <l n="4532">To veil the Heaven , though darkness there might well</l>
     <l n="4533">Seem twilight here : And now went forth the Morn</l>
     <l n="4534">Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold</l>
     <l n="4535">Empyreal ; from before her vanished Night ,</l>
     <l n="4536">Shot through with orient beams ; when all the plain</l>
     <l n="4537">Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright ,</l>
     <l n="4538">Chariots , and flaming arms , and fiery steeds ,</l>
     <l n="4539">Reflecting blaze on blaze , first met his view :</l>
     <l n="4540">War he perceived , war in procinct ; and found</l>
     <l n="4541">Already known what he for news had thought</l>
     <l n="4542">To have reported : Gladly then he mixed</l>
     <l n="4543">Among those friendly Powers , who him received</l>
     <l n="4544">With joy and acclamations loud , that one ,</l>
     <l n="4545">That of so many myriads fallen , yet one</l>
     <l n="4546">Returned not lost . On to the sacred hill</l>
     <l n="4547">They led him high applauded , and present</l>
     <l n="4548">Before the seat supreme ; from whence a voice ,</l>
     <l n="4549">From midst a golden cloud , thus mild was heard .</l>
     <l n="4550">Servant of God . Well done ; well hast thou fought</l>
     <l n="4551">The better fight , who single hast maintained</l>
     <l n="4552">Against revolted multitudes the cause</l>
     <l n="4553">Of truth , in word mightier than they in arms ;</l>
     <l n="4554">And for the testimony of truth hast borne</l>
     <l n="4555">Universal reproach , far worse to bear</l>
     <l n="4556">Than violence ; for this was all thy care</l>
     <l n="4557">To stand approved in sight of God , though worlds</l>
     <l n="4558">Judged thee perverse : The easier conquest now</l>
     <l n="4559">Remains thee , aided by this host of friends ,</l>
     <l n="4560">Back on thy foes more glorious to return ,</l>
     <l n="4561">Than scorned thou didst depart ; and to subdue</l>
     <l n="4562">By force , who reason for their law refuse ,</l>
     <l n="4563">Right reason for their law , and for their King</l>
     <l n="4564">Messiah , who by right of merit reigns .</l>
     <l n="4565">Go , Michael , of celestial armies prince ,</l>
     <l n="4566">And thou , in military prowess next ,</l>
     <l n="4567">Gabriel , lead forth to battle these my sons</l>
     <l n="4568">Invincible ; lead forth my armed Saints ,</l>
     <l n="4569">By thousands and by millions , ranged for fight ,</l>
     <l n="4570">Equal in number to that Godless crew</l>
     <l n="4571">Rebellious : Them with fire and hostile arms</l>
     <l n="4572">Fearless assault ; and , to the brow of Heaven</l>
     <l n="4573">Pursuing , drive them out from God and bliss ,</l>
     <l n="4574">Into their place of punishment , the gulf</l>
     <l n="4575">Of Tartarus , which ready opens wide</l>
     <l n="4576">His fiery Chaos to receive their fall .</l>
     <l n="4577">So spake the Sovran Voice , and clouds began</l>
     <l n="4578">To darken all the hill , and smoke to roll</l>
     <l n="4579">In dusky wreaths , reluctant flames , the sign</l>
     <l n="4580">Of wrath awaked ; nor with less dread the loud</l>
     <l n="4581">Ethereal trumpet from on high ‘ gan blow :</l>
     <l n="4582">At which command the Powers militant ,</l>
     <l n="4583">That stood for Heaven , in mighty quadrate joined</l>
     <l n="4584">Of union irresistible , moved on</l>
     <l n="4585">In silence their bright legions , to the sound</l>
     <l n="4586">Of instrumental harmony , that breathed</l>
     <l n="4587">Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds</l>
     <l n="4588">Under their God-like leaders , in the cause</l>
     <l n="4589">Of God and his Messiah . On they move</l>
     <l n="4590">Indissolubly firm ; nor obvious hill ,</l>
     <l n="4591">Nor straitening vale , nor wood , nor stream , divides</l>
     <l n="4592">Their perfect ranks ; for high above the ground</l>
     <l n="4593">Their march was , and the passive air upbore</l>
     <l n="4594">Their nimble tread ; as when the total kind</l>
     <l n="4595">Of birds , in orderly array on wing ,</l>
     <l n="4596">Came summoned over Eden to receive</l>
     <l n="4597">Their names of thee ; so over many a tract</l>
     <l n="4598">Of Heaven they marched , and many a province wide ,</l>
     <l n="4599">Tenfold the length of this terrene : At last ,</l>
     <l n="4600">Far in the horizon to the north appeared</l>
     <l n="4601">From skirt to skirt a fiery region , stretched</l>
     <l n="4602">In battailous aspect , and nearer view</l>
     <l n="4603">Bristled with upright beams innumerable</l>
     <l n="4604">Of rigid spears , and helmets thronged , and shields</l>
     <l n="4605">Various , with boastful argument portrayed ,</l>
     <l n="4606">The banded Powers of Satan hasting on</l>
     <l n="4607">With furious expedition ; for they weened</l>
     <l n="4608">That self-same day , by fight or by surprise ,</l>
     <l n="4609">To win the mount of God , and on his throne</l>
     <l n="4610">To set the Envier of his state , the proud</l>
     <l n="4611">Aspirer ; but their thoughts proved fond and vain</l>
     <l n="4612">In the mid way : Though strange to us it seemed</l>
     <l n="4613">At first , that Angel should with Angel war ,</l>
     <l n="4614">And in fierce hosting meet , who wont to meet</l>
     <l n="4615">So oft in festivals of joy and love</l>
     <l n="4616">Unanimous , as sons of one great Sire ,</l>
     <l n="4617">Hymning the Eternal Father : But the shout</l>
     <l n="4618">Of battle now began , and rushing sound</l>
     <l n="4619">Of onset ended soon each milder thought .</l>
     <l n="4620">High in the midst , exalted as a God ,</l>
     <l n="4621">The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat ,</l>
     <l n="4622">Idol of majesty divine , enclosed</l>
     <l n="4623">With flaming Cherubim , and golden shields ;</l>
     <l n="4624">Then lighted from his gorgeous throne , for now</l>
     <l n="4625">‘ Twixt host and host but narrow space was left ,</l>
     <l n="4626">A dreadful interval , and front to front</l>
     <l n="4627">Presented stood in terrible array</l>
     <l n="4628">Of hideous length : Before the cloudy van ,</l>
     <l n="4629">On the rough edge of battle ere it joined ,</l>
     <l n="4630">Satan , with vast and haughty strides advanced ,</l>
     <l n="4631">Came towering , armed in adamant and gold ;</l>
     <l n="4632">Abdiel that sight endured not , where he stood</l>
     <l n="4633">Among the mightiest , bent on highest deeds ,</l>
     <l n="4634">And thus his own undaunted heart explores .</l>
     <l n="4635">O Heaven ! that such resemblance of the Highest</l>
     <l n="4636">Should yet remain , where faith and realty</l>
     <l n="4637">Remain not : Wherefore should not strength and might</l>
     <l n="4638">There fail where virtue fails , or weakest prove</l>
     <l n="4639">Where boldest , though to fight unconquerable ?</l>
     <l n="4640">His puissance , trusting in the Almighty 's aid ,</l>
     <l n="4641">I mean to try , whose reason I have tried</l>
     <l n="4642">Unsound and false ; nor is it aught but just ,</l>
     <l n="4643">That he , who in debate of truth hath won ,</l>
     <l n="4644">Should win in arms , in both disputes alike</l>
     <l n="4645">Victor ; though brutish that contest and foul ,</l>
     <l n="4646">When reason hath to deal with force , yet so</l>
     <l n="4647">Most reason is that reason overcome .</l>
     <l n="4648">So pondering , and from his armed peers</l>
     <l n="4649">Forth stepping opposite , half-way he met</l>
     <l n="4650">His daring foe , at this prevention more</l>
     <l n="4651">Incensed , and thus securely him defied .</l>
     <l n="4652">Proud , art thou met ? thy hope was to have reached</l>
     <l n="4653">The highth of thy aspiring unopposed ,</l>
     <l n="4654">The throne of God unguarded , and his side</l>
     <l n="4655">Abandoned , at the terrour of thy power</l>
     <l n="4656">Or potent tongue : Fool ! not to think how vain</l>
     <l n="4657">Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms ;</l>
     <l n="4658">Who out of smallest things could , without end ,</l>
     <l n="4659">Have raised incessant armies to defeat</l>
     <l n="4660">Thy folly ; or with solitary hand</l>
     <l n="4661">Reaching beyond all limit , at one blow ,</l>
     <l n="4662">Unaided , could have finished thee , and whelmed</l>
     <l n="4663">Thy legions under darkness : But thou seest</l>
     <l n="4664">All are not of thy train ; there be , who faith</l>
     <l n="4665">Prefer , and piety to God , though then</l>
     <l n="4666">To thee not visible , when I alone</l>
     <l n="4667">Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent</l>
     <l n="4668">From all : My sect thou seest ; now learn too late</l>
     <l n="4669">How few sometimes may know , when thousands err .</l>
     <l n="4670">Whom the grand foe , with scornful eye askance ,</l>
     <l n="4671">Thus answered . Ill for thee , but in wished hour</l>
     <l n="4672">Of my revenge , first sought for , thou returnest</l>
     <l n="4673">From flight , seditious Angel ! to receive</l>
     <l n="4674">Thy merited reward , the first assay</l>
     <l n="4675">Of this right hand provoked , since first that tongue ,</l>
     <l n="4676">Inspired with contradiction , durst oppose</l>
     <l n="4677">A third part of the Gods , in synod met</l>
     <l n="4678">Their deities to assert ; who , while they feel</l>
     <l n="4679">Vigour divine within them , can allow</l>
     <l n="4680">Omnipotence to none . But well thou comest</l>
     <l n="4681">Before thy fellows , ambitious to win</l>
     <l n="4682">From me some plume , that thy success may show</l>
     <l n="4683">Destruction to the rest : This pause between ,</l>
     <l n="4684">( Unanswered lest thou boast ) to let thee know ,</l>
     <l n="4685">At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven</l>
     <l n="4686">To heavenly souls had been all one ; but now</l>
     <l n="4687">I see that most through sloth had rather serve ,</l>
     <l n="4688">Ministring Spirits , trained up in feast and song !</l>
     <l n="4689">Such hast thou armed , the minstrelsy of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="4690">Servility with freedom to contend ,</l>
     <l n="4691">As both their deeds compared this day shall prove .</l>
     <l n="4692">To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied .</l>
     <l n="4693">Apostate ! still thou errest , nor end wilt find</l>
     <l n="4694">Of erring , from the path of truth remote :</l>
     <l n="4695">Unjustly thou depravest it with the name</l>
     <l n="4696">Of servitude , to serve whom God ordains ,</l>
     <l n="4697">Or Nature : God and Nature bid the same ,</l>
     <l n="4698">When he who rules is worthiest , and excels</l>
     <l n="4699">Them whom he governs . This is servitude ,</l>
     <l n="4700">To serve the unwise , or him who hath rebelled</l>
     <l n="4701">Against his worthier , as thine now serve thee ,</l>
     <l n="4702">Thyself not free , but to thyself enthralled ;</l>
     <l n="4703">Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid .</l>
     <l n="4704">Reign thou in Hell , thy kingdom ; let me serve</l>
     <l n="4705">In Heaven God ever blest , and his divine</l>
     <l n="4706">Behests obey , worthiest to be obeyed ;</l>
     <l n="4707">Yet chains in Hell , not realms , expect : Mean while</l>
     <l n="4708">From me returned , as erst thou saidst , from flight ,</l>
     <l n="4709">This greeting on thy impious crest receive .</l>
     <l n="4710">So saying , a noble stroke he lifted high ,</l>
     <l n="4711">Which hung not , but so swift with tempest fell</l>
     <l n="4712">On the proud crest of Satan , that no sight ,</l>
     <l n="4713">Nor motion of swift thought , less could his shield ,</l>
     <l n="4714">Such ruin intercept : Ten paces huge</l>
     <l n="4715">He back recoiled ; the tenth on bended knee</l>
     <l n="4716">His massy spear upstaid ; as if on earth</l>
     <l n="4717">Winds under ground , or waters forcing way ,</l>
     <l n="4718">Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat ,</l>
     <l n="4719">Half sunk with all his pines . Amazement seised</l>
     <l n="4720">The rebel Thrones , but greater rage , to see</l>
     <l n="4721">Thus foiled their mightiest ; ours joy filled , and shout ,</l>
     <l n="4722">Presage of victory , and fierce desire</l>
     <l n="4723">Of battle : Whereat Michael bid sound</l>
     <l n="4724">The Arch-Angel trumpet ; through the vast of Heaven</l>
     <l n="4725">It sounded , and the faithful armies rung</l>
     <l n="4726">Hosanna to the Highest : Nor stood at gaze</l>
     <l n="4727">The adverse legions , nor less hideous joined</l>
     <l n="4728">The horrid shock . Now storming fury rose ,</l>
     <l n="4729">And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now</l>
     <l n="4730">Was never ; arms on armour clashing brayed</l>
     <l n="4731">Horrible discord , and the madding wheels</l>
     <l n="4732">Of brazen chariots raged ; dire was the noise</l>
     <l n="4733">Of conflict ; over head the dismal hiss</l>
     <l n="4734">Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew ,</l>
     <l n="4735">And flying vaulted either host with fire .</l>
     <l n="4736">So under fiery cope together rushed</l>
     <l n="4737">Both battles main , with ruinous assault</l>
     <l n="4738">And inextinguishable rage . All Heaven</l>
     <l n="4739">Resounded ; and had Earth been then , all Earth</l>
     <l n="4740">Had to her center shook . What wonder ? when</l>
     <l n="4741">Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought</l>
     <l n="4742">On either side , the least of whom could wield</l>
     <l n="4743">These elements , and arm him with the force</l>
     <l n="4744">Of all their regions : How much more of power</l>
     <l n="4745">Army against army numberless to raise</l>
     <l n="4746">Dreadful combustion warring , and disturb ,</l>
     <l n="4747">Though not destroy , their happy native seat ;</l>
     <l n="4748">Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent ,</l>
     <l n="4749">From his strong hold of Heaven , high over-ruled</l>
     <l n="4750">And limited their might ; though numbered such</l>
     <l n="4751">As each divided legion might have seemed</l>
     <l n="4752">A numerous host ; in strength each armed hand</l>
     <l n="4753">A legion ; led in fight , yet leader seemed</l>
     <l n="4754">Each warriour single as in chief , expert</l>
     <l n="4755">When to advance , or stand , or turn the sway</l>
     <l n="4756">Of battle , open when , and when to close</l>
     <l n="4757">The ridges of grim war : No thought of flight ,</l>
     <l n="4758">None of retreat , no unbecoming deed</l>
     <l n="4759">That argued fear ; each on himself relied ,</l>
     <l n="4760">As only in his arm the moment lay</l>
     <l n="4761">Of victory : Deeds of eternal fame</l>
     <l n="4762">Were done , but infinite ; for wide was spread</l>
     <l n="4763">That war and various ; sometimes on firm ground</l>
     <l n="4764">A standing fight , then , soaring on main wing ,</l>
     <l n="4765">Tormented all the air ; all air seemed then</l>
     <l n="4766">Conflicting fire . Long time in even scale</l>
     <l n="4767">The battle hung ; till Satan , who that day</l>
     <l n="4768">Prodigious power had shown , and met in arms</l>
     <l n="4769">No equal , ranging through the dire attack</l>
     <l n="4770">Of fighting Seraphim confused , at length</l>
     <l n="4771">Saw where the sword of Michael smote , and felled</l>
     <l n="4772">Squadrons at once ; with huge two-handed sway</l>
     <l n="4773">Brandished aloft , the horrid edge came down</l>
     <l n="4774">Wide-wasting ; such destruction to withstand</l>
     <l n="4775">He hasted , and opposed the rocky orb</l>
     <l n="4776">Of tenfold adamant , his ample shield ,</l>
     <l n="4777">A vast circumference . At his approach</l>
     <l n="4778">The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil</l>
     <l n="4779">Surceased , and glad , as hoping here to end</l>
     <l n="4780">Intestine war in Heaven , the arch-foe subdued</l>
     <l n="4781">Or captive dragged in chains , with hostile frown</l>
     <l n="4782">And visage all inflamed first thus began .</l>
     <l n="4783">Author of evil , unknown till thy revolt ,</l>
     <l n="4784">Unnamed in Heaven , now plenteous as thou seest</l>
     <l n="4785">These acts of hateful strife , hateful to all ,</l>
     <l n="4786">Though heaviest by just measure on thyself ,</l>
     <l n="4787">And thy adherents : How hast thou disturbed</l>
     <l n="4788">Heaven 's blessed peace , and into nature brought</l>
     <l n="4789">Misery , uncreated till the crime</l>
     <l n="4790">Of thy rebellion ! how hast thou instilled</l>
     <l n="4791">Thy malice into thousands , once upright</l>
     <l n="4792">And faithful , now proved false ! But think not here</l>
     <l n="4793">To trouble holy rest ; Heaven casts thee out</l>
     <l n="4794">From all her confines . Heaven , the seat of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="4795">Brooks not the works of violence and war .</l>
     <l n="4796">Hence then , and evil go with thee along ,</l>
     <l n="4797">Thy offspring , to the place of evil , Hell ;</l>
     <l n="4798">Thou and thy wicked crew ! there mingle broils ,</l>
     <l n="4799">Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom ,</l>
     <l n="4800">Or some more sudden vengeance , winged from God ,</l>
     <l n="4801">Precipitate thee with augmented pain .</l>
     <l n="4802">So spake the Prince of Angels ; to whom thus</l>
     <l n="4803">The Adversary . Nor think thou with wind</l>
     <l n="4804">Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds</l>
     <l n="4805">Thou canst not . Hast thou turned the least of these</l>
     <l n="4806">To flight , or if to fall , but that they rise</l>
     <l n="4807">Unvanquished , easier to transact with me</l>
     <l n="4808">That thou shouldst hope , imperious , and with threats</l>
     <l n="4809">To chase me hence ? err not , that so shall end</l>
     <l n="4810">The strife which thou callest evil , but we style</l>
     <l n="4811">The strife of glory ; which we mean to win ,</l>
     <l n="4812">Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell</l>
     <l n="4813">Thou fablest ; here however to dwell free ,</l>
     <l n="4814">If not to reign : Mean while thy utmost force ,</l>
     <l n="4815">And join him named Almighty to thy aid ,</l>
     <l n="4816">I fly not , but have sought thee far and nigh .</l>
     <l n="4817">They ended parle , and both addressed for fight</l>
     <l n="4818">Unspeakable ; for who , though with the tongue</l>
     <l n="4819">Of Angels , can relate , or to what things</l>
     <l n="4820">Liken on earth conspicuous , that may lift</l>
     <l n="4821">Human imagination to such highth</l>
     <l n="4822">Of Godlike power ? for likest Gods they seemed ,</l>
     <l n="4823">Stood they or moved , in stature , motion , arms ,</l>
     <l n="4824">Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven .</l>
     <l n="4825">Now waved their fiery swords , and in the air</l>
     <l n="4826">Made horrid circles ; two broad suns their shields</l>
     <l n="4827">Blazed opposite , while Expectation stood</l>
     <l n="4828">In horrour : From each hand with speed retired ,</l>
     <l n="4829">Where erst was thickest fight , the angelick throng ,</l>
     <l n="4830">And left large field , unsafe within the wind</l>
     <l n="4831">Of such commotion ; such as , to set forth</l>
     <l n="4832">Great things by small , if , nature 's concord broke ,</l>
     <l n="4833">Among the constellations war were sprung ,</l>
     <l n="4834">Two planets , rushing from aspect malign</l>
     <l n="4835">Of fiercest opposition , in mid sky</l>
     <l n="4836">Should combat , and their jarring spheres confound .</l>
     <l n="4837">Together both with next to almighty arm</l>
     <l n="4838">Up-lifted imminent , one stroke they aimed</l>
     <l n="4839">That might determine , and not need repeat ,</l>
     <l n="4840">As not of power at once ; nor odds appeared</l>
     <l n="4841">In might or swift prevention : But the sword</l>
     <l n="4842">Of Michael from the armoury of God</l>
     <l n="4843">Was given him tempered so , that neither keen</l>
     <l n="4844">Nor solid might resist that edge : it met</l>
     <l n="4845">The sword of Satan , with steep force to smite</l>
     <l n="4846">Descending , and in half cut sheer ; nor staid ,</l>
     <l n="4847">But with swift wheel reverse , deep entering , shared</l>
     <l n="4848">All his right side : Then Satan first knew pain ,</l>
     <l n="4849">And writhed him to and fro convolved ; so sore</l>
     <l n="4850">The griding sword with discontinuous wound</l>
     <l n="4851">Passed through him : But the ethereal substance closed ,</l>
     <l n="4852">Not long divisible ; and from the gash</l>
     <l n="4853">A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed</l>
     <l n="4854">Sanguine , such as celestial Spirits may bleed ,</l>
     <l n="4855">And all his armour stained , ere while so bright .</l>
     <l n="4856">Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run</l>
     <l n="4857">By Angels many and strong , who interposed</l>
     <l n="4858">Defence , while others bore him on their shields</l>
     <l n="4859">Back to his chariot , where it stood retired</l>
     <l n="4860">From off the files of war : There they him laid</l>
     <l n="4861">Gnashing for anguish , and despite , and shame ,</l>
     <l n="4862">To find himself not matchless , and his pride</l>
     <l n="4863">Humbled by such rebuke , so far beneath</l>
     <l n="4864">His confidence to equal God in power .</l>
     <l n="4865">Yet soon he healed ; for Spirits that live throughout</l>
     <l n="4866">Vital in every part , not as frail man</l>
     <l n="4867">In entrails , heart of head , liver or reins ,</l>
     <l n="4868">Cannot but by annihilating die ;</l>
     <l n="4869">Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound</l>
     <l n="4870">Receive , no more than can the fluid air :</l>
     <l n="4871">All heart they live , all head , all eye , all ear ,</l>
     <l n="4872">All intellect , all sense ; and , as they please ,</l>
     <l n="4873">They limb themselves , and colour , shape , or size</l>
     <l n="4874">Assume , as likes them best , condense or rare .</l>
     <l n="4875">Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved</l>
     <l n="4876">Memorial , where the might of Gabriel fought ,</l>
     <l n="4877">And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array</l>
     <l n="4878">Of Moloch , furious king ; who him defied ,</l>
     <l n="4879">And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound</l>
     <l n="4880">Threatened , nor from the Holy One of Heaven</l>
     <l n="4881">Refrained his tongue blasphemous ; but anon</l>
     <l n="4882">Down cloven to the waist , with shattered arms</l>
     <l n="4883">And uncouth pain fled bellowing . On each wing</l>
     <l n="4884">Uriel , and Raphael , his vaunting foe ,</l>
     <l n="4885">Though huge , and in a rock of diamond armed ,</l>
     <l n="4886">Vanquished Adramelech , and Asmadai ,</l>
     <l n="4887">Two potent Thrones , that to be less than Gods</l>
     <l n="4888">Disdained , but meaner thoughts learned in their flight ,</l>
     <l n="4889">Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail .</l>
     <l n="4890">Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy</l>
     <l n="4891">The atheist crew , but with redoubled blow</l>
     <l n="4892">Ariel , and Arioch , and the violence</l>
     <l n="4893">Of Ramiel scorched and blasted , overthrew .</l>
     <l n="4894">I might relate of thousands , and their names</l>
     <l n="4895">Eternize here on earth ; but those elect</l>
     <l n="4896">Angels , contented with their fame in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="4897">Seek not the praise of men : The other sort ,</l>
     <l n="4898">In might though wonderous and in acts of war ,</l>
     <l n="4899">Nor of renown less eager , yet by doom</l>
     <l n="4900">Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory ,</l>
     <l n="4901">Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell .</l>
     <l n="4902">For strength from truth divided , and from just ,</l>
     <l n="4903">Illaudable , nought merits but dispraise</l>
     <l n="4904">And ignominy ; yet to glory aspires</l>
     <l n="4905">Vain-glorious , and through infamy seeks fame :</l>
     <l n="4906">Therefore eternal silence be their doom .</l>
     <l n="4907">And now , their mightiest quelled , the battle swerved ,</l>
     <l n="4908">With many an inroad gored ; deformed rout</l>
     <l n="4909">Entered , and foul disorder ; all the ground</l>
     <l n="4910">With shivered armour strown , and on a heap</l>
     <l n="4911">Chariot and charioteer lay overturned ,</l>
     <l n="4912">And fiery-foaming steeds ; what stood , recoiled</l>
     <l n="4913">O'erhYpppHeNwearied , through the faint Satanick host</l>
     <l n="4914">Defensive scarce , or with pale fear surprised ,</l>
     <l n="4915">Then first with fear surprised , and sense of pain ,</l>
     <l n="4916">Fled ignominious , to such evil brought</l>
     <l n="4917">By sin of disobedience ; till that hour</l>
     <l n="4918">Not liable to fear , or flight , or pain .</l>
     <l n="4919">Far otherwise the inviolable Saints ,</l>
     <l n="4920">In cubick phalanx firm , advanced entire ,</l>
     <l n="4921">Invulnerable , impenetrably armed ;</l>
     <l n="4922">Such high advantages their innocence</l>
     <l n="4923">Gave them above their foes ; not to have sinned ,</l>
     <l n="4924">Not to have disobeyed ; in fight they stood</l>
     <l n="4925">Unwearied , unobnoxious to be pained</l>
     <l n="4926">By wound , though from their place by violence moved ,</l>
     <l n="4927">Now Night her course began , and , over Heaven</l>
     <l n="4928">Inducing darkness , grateful truce imposed ,</l>
     <l n="4929">And silence on the odious din of war :</l>
     <l n="4930">Under her cloudy covert both retired ,</l>
     <l n="4931">Victor and vanquished : On the foughten field</l>
     <l n="4932">Michael and his Angels prevalent</l>
     <l n="4933">Encamping , placed in guard their watches round ,</l>
     <l n="4934">Cherubick waving fires : On the other part ,</l>
     <l n="4935">Satan with his rebellious disappeared ,</l>
     <l n="4936">Far in the dark dislodged ; and , void of rest ,</l>
     <l n="4937">His potentates to council called by night ;</l>
     <l n="4938">And in the midst thus undismayed began .</l>
     <l n="4939">O now in danger tried , now known in arms</l>
     <l n="4940">Not to be overpowered , Companions dear ,</l>
     <l n="4941">Found worthy not of liberty alone ,</l>
     <l n="4942">Too mean pretence ! but what we more affect ,</l>
     <l n="4943">Honour , dominion , glory , and renown ;</l>
     <l n="4944">Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight ,</l>
     <l n="4945">( And if one day , why not eternal days ? )</l>
     <l n="4946">What Heaven 's Lord had powerfullest to send</l>
     <l n="4947">Against us from about his throne , and judged</l>
     <l n="4948">Sufficient to subdue us to his will ,</l>
     <l n="4949">But proves not so : Then fallible , it seems ,</l>
     <l n="4950">Of future we may deem him , though till now</l>
     <l n="4951">Omniscient thought . True is , less firmly armed ,</l>
     <l n="4952">Some disadvantage we endured and pain ,</l>
     <l n="4953">Till now not known , but , known , as soon contemned ;</l>
     <l n="4954">Since now we find this our empyreal form</l>
     <l n="4955">Incapable of mortal injury ,</l>
     <l n="4956">Imperishable , and , though pierced with wound ,</l>
     <l n="4957">Soon closing , and by native vigour healed .</l>
     <l n="4958">Of evil then so small as easy think</l>
     <l n="4959">The remedy ; perhaps more valid arms ,</l>
     <l n="4960">Weapons more violent , when next we meet ,</l>
     <l n="4961">May serve to better us , and worse our foes ,</l>
     <l n="4962">Or equal what between us made the odds ,</l>
     <l n="4963">In nature none : If other hidden cause</l>
     <l n="4964">Left them superiour , while we can preserve</l>
     <l n="4965">Unhurt our minds , and understanding sound ,</l>
     <l n="4966">Due search and consultation will disclose .</l>
     <l n="4967">He sat ; and in the assembly next upstood</l>

     <l n="4970">Sore toiled , his riven arms to havock hewn ,</l>

     <l n="4973">Enjoyment of our right as Gods ; yet hard</l>
     <l n="4974">For Gods , and too unequal work we find ,</l>
     <l n="4975">Against unequal arms to fight in pain ,</l>
     <l n="4976">Against unpained , impassive ; from which evil</l>
     <l n="4977">Ruin must needs ensue ; for what avails</l>
     <l n="4978">Valour or strength , though matchless , quelled with pain</l>
     <l n="4979">Which all subdues , and makes remiss the hands</l>
     <l n="4980">Of mightiest ? Sense of pleasure we may well</l>
     <l n="4981">Spare out of life perhaps , and not repine ,</l>
     <l n="4982">But live content , which is the calmest life :</l>
     <l n="4983">But pain is perfect misery , the worst</l>
     <l n="4984">Of evils , and , excessive , overturns</l>
     <l n="4985">All patience . He , who therefore can invent</l>
     <l n="4986">With what more forcible we may offend</l>
     <l n="4987">Our yet unwounded enemies , or arm</l>
     <l n="4988">Ourselves with like defence , to me deserves</l>
     <l n="4989">No less than for deliverance what we owe .</l>
     <l n="4990">Whereto with look composed Satan replied .</l>
     <l n="4991">Not uninvented that , which thou aright</l>
     <l n="4992">Believest so main to our success , I bring .</l>
     <l n="4993">Which of us who beholds the bright surface</l>
     <l n="4994">Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand ,</l>
     <l n="4995">This continent of spacious Heaven , adorned</l>
     <l n="4996">With plant , fruit , flower ambrosial , gems , and gold ;</l>
     <l n="4997">Whose eye so superficially surveys</l>
     <l n="4998">These things , as not to mind from whence they grow</l>
     <l n="4999">Deep under ground , materials dark and crude ,</l>
     <l n="5000">Of spiritous and fiery spume , till touched</l>
     <l n="5001">With Heaven 's ray , and tempered , they shoot forth</l>
     <l n="5002">So beauteous , opening to the ambient light ?</l>
     <l n="5003">These in their dark nativity the deep</l>
     <l n="5004">Shall yield us , pregnant with infernal flame ;</l>
     <l n="5005">Which , into hollow engines , long and round ,</l>
     <l n="5006">Thick rammed , at the other bore with touch of fire</l>
     <l n="5007">Dilated and infuriate , shall send forth</l>
     <l n="5008">From far , with thundering noise , among our foes</l>
     <l n="5009">Such implements of mischief , as shall dash</l>
     <l n="5010">To pieces , and o'erwhelm whatever stands</l>
     <l n="5011">Adverse , that they shall fear we have disarmed</l>
     <l n="5012">The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt .</l>
     <l n="5013">Nor long shall be our labour ; yet ere dawn ,</l>
     <l n="5014">Effect shall end our wish . Mean while revive ;</l>
     <l n="5015">Abandon fear ; to strength and counsel joined</l>
     <l n="5016">Think nothing hard , much less to be despaired .</l>
     <l n="5017">He ended , and his words their drooping cheer</l>
     <l n="5018">Enlightened , and their languished hope revived .</l>
     <l n="5019">The invention all admired , and each , how he</l>
     <l n="5020">To be the inventer missed ; so easy it seemed</l>
     <l n="5021">Once found , which yet unfound most would have thought</l>
     <l n="5022">Impossible : Yet , haply , of thy race</l>
     <l n="5023">In future days , if malice should abound ,</l>
     <l n="5024">Some one intent on mischief , or inspired</l>
     <l n="5025">With devilish machination , might devise</l>
     <l n="5026">Like instrument to plague the sons of men</l>
     <l n="5027">For sin , on war and mutual slaughter bent .</l>
     <l n="5028">Forthwith from council to the work they flew ;</l>
     <l n="5029">None arguing stood ; innumerable hands</l>
     <l n="5030">Were ready ; in a moment up they turned</l>
     <l n="5031">Wide the celestial soil , and saw beneath</l>
     <l n="5032">The originals of nature in their crude</l>
     <l n="5033">Conception ; sulphurous and nitrous foam</l>
     <l n="5034">They found , they mingled , and , with subtle art ,</l>
     <l n="5035">Concocted and adusted they reduced</l>
     <l n="5036">To blackest grain , and into store conveyed :</l>
     <l n="5037">Part hidden veins digged up ( nor hath this earth</l>
     <l n="5038">Entrails unlike ) of mineral and stone ,</l>
     <l n="5039">Whereof to found their engines and their balls</l>
     <l n="5040">Of missive ruin ; part incentive reed</l>
     <l n="5041">Provide , pernicious with one touch to fire .</l>
     <l n="5042">So all ere day-spring , under conscious night ,</l>
     <l n="5043">Secret they finished , and in order set ,</l>
     <l n="5044">With silent circumspection , unespied .</l>
     <l n="5045">Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared ,</l>
     <l n="5046">Up rose the victor-Angels , and to arms</l>
     <l n="5047">The matin trumpet sung : In arms they stood</l>
     <l n="5048">Of golden panoply , refulgent host ,</l>
     <l n="5049">Soon banded ; others from the dawning hills</l>
     <l n="5050">Look round , and scouts each coast light-armed scour ,</l>
     <l n="5051">Each quarter to descry the distant foe ,</l>
     <l n="5052">Where lodged , or whither fled , or if for fight ,</l>
     <l n="5053">In motion or in halt : Him soon they met</l>
     <l n="5054">Under spread ensigns moving nigh , in slow</l>
     <l n="5055">But firm battalion ; back with speediest sail</l>
     <l n="5056">Zophiel , of Cherubim the swiftest wing ,</l>
     <l n="5057">Came flying , and in mid air aloud thus cried .</l>
     <l n="5058">Arm , Warriours , arm for fight ; the foe at hand ,</l>
     <l n="5059">Whom fled we thought , will save us long pursuit</l>
     <l n="5060">This day ; fear not his flight ; so thick a cloud</l>
     <l n="5061">He comes , and settled in his face I see</l>
     <l n="5062">Sad resolution , and secure : Let each</l>
     <l n="5063">His adamantine coat gird well , and each</l>
     <l n="5064">Fit well his helm , gripe fast his orbed shield ,</l>
     <l n="5065">Borne even or high ; for this day will pour down ,</l>
     <l n="5066">If I conjecture aught , no drizzling shower ,</l>
     <l n="5067">But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire .</l>
     <l n="5068">So warned he them , aware themselves , and soon</l>
     <l n="5069">In order , quit of all impediment ;</l>
     <l n="5070">Instant without disturb they took alarm ,</l>
     <l n="5071">And onward moved embattled : When behold !</l>
     <l n="5072">Not distant far with heavy pace the foe</l>
     <l n="5073">Approaching gross and huge , in hollow cube</l>
     <l n="5074">Training his devilish enginery , impaled</l>
     <l n="5075">On every side with shadowing squadrons deep ,</l>
     <l n="5076">To hide the fraud . At interview both stood</l>
     <l n="5077">A while ; but suddenly at head appeared</l>
     <l n="5078">Satan , and thus was heard commanding loud .</l>
     <l n="5079">Vanguard , to right and left the front unfold ;</l>
     <l n="5080">That all may see who hate us , how we seek</l>
     <l n="5081">Peace and composure , and with open breast</l>
     <l n="5082">Stand ready to receive them , if they like</l>
     <l n="5083">Our overture ; and turn not back perverse :</l>
     <l n="5084">But that I doubt ; however witness , Heaven !</l>
     <l n="5085">Heaven , witness thou anon ! while we discharge</l>
     <l n="5086">Freely our part : ye , who appointed stand</l>
     <l n="5087">Do as you have in charge , and briefly touch</l>
     <l n="5088">What we propound , and loud that all may hear !</l>
     <l n="5089">So scoffing in ambiguous words , he scarce</l>
     <l n="5090">Had ended ; when to right and left the front</l>
     <l n="5091">Divided , and to either flank retired :</l>
     <l n="5092">Which to our eyes discovered , new and strange ,</l>
     <l n="5093">A triple mounted row of pillars laid</l>
     <l n="5094">On wheels ( for like to pillars most they seemed ,</l>
     <l n="5095">Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir ,</l>
     <l n="5096">With branches lopt , in wood or mountain felled ,)</l>
     <l n="5097">Brass , iron , stony mould , had not their mouths</l>
     <l n="5098">With hideous orifice gaped on us wide ,</l>
     <l n="5099">Portending hollow truce : At each behind</l>
     <l n="5100">A Seraph stood , and in his hand a reed</l>
     <l n="5101">Stood waving tipt with fire ; while we , suspense ,</l>
     <l n="5102">Collected stood within our thoughts amused ,</l>
     <l n="5103">Not long ; for sudden all at once their reeds</l>
     <l n="5104">Put forth , and to a narrow vent applied</l>
     <l n="5105">With nicest touch . Immediate in a flame ,</l>
     <l n="5106">But soon obscured with smoke , all Heaven appeared ,</l>
     <l n="5107">From those deep-throated engines belched , whose roar</l>
     <l n="5108">Embowelled with outrageous noise the air ,</l>
     <l n="5109">And all her entrails tore , disgorging foul</l>
     <l n="5110">Their devilish glut , chained thunderbolts and hail</l>
     <l n="5111">Of iron globes ; which , on the victor host</l>
     <l n="5112">Levelled , with such impetuous fury smote ,</l>
     <l n="5113">That , whom they hit , none on their feet might stand ,</l>
     <l n="5114">Though standing else as rocks , but down they fell</l>
     <l n="5115">By thousands , Angel on Arch-Angel rolled ;</l>
     <l n="5116">The sooner for their arms ; unarmed , they might</l>
     <l n="5117">Have easily , as Spirits , evaded swift</l>
     <l n="5118">By quick contraction or remove ; but now</l>
     <l n="5119">Foul dissipation followed , and forced rout ;</l>
     <l n="5120">Nor served it to relax their serried files .</l>
     <l n="5121">What should they do ? if on they rushed , repulse</l>
     <l n="5122">Repeated , and indecent overthrow</l>
     <l n="5123">Doubled , would render them yet more despised ,</l>
     <l n="5124">And to their foes a laughter ; for in view</l>
     <l n="5125">Stood ranked of Seraphim another row ,</l>
     <l n="5126">In posture to displode their second tire</l>
     <l n="5127">Of thunder : Back defeated to return</l>
     <l n="5128">They worse abhorred . Satan beheld their plight ,</l>
     <l n="5129">And to his mates thus in derision called .</l>
     <l n="5130">O Friends ! why come not on these victors proud</l>
     <l n="5131">Ere while they fierce were coming ; and when we ,</l>
     <l n="5132">To entertain them fair with open front</l>
     <l n="5133">And breast , ( what could we more ? ) propounded terms</l>
     <l n="5134">Of composition , straight they changed their minds ,</l>
     <l n="5135">Flew off , and into strange vagaries fell ,</l>
     <l n="5136">As they would dance ; yet for a dance they seemed</l>
     <l n="5137">Somewhat extravagant and wild ; perhaps</l>
     <l n="5138">For joy of offered peace : But I suppose ,</l>
     <l n="5139">If our proposals once again were heard ,</l>
     <l n="5140">We should compel them to a quick result .</l>
     <l n="5141">To whom thus Belial , in like gamesome mood .</l>
     <l n="5142">Leader ! the terms we sent were terms of weight ,</l>
     <l n="5143">Of hard contents , and full of force urged home ;</l>
     <l n="5144">Such as we might perceive amused them all ,</l>
     <l n="5145">And stumbled many : Who receives them right ,</l>
     <l n="5146">Had need from head to foot well understand ;</l>
     <l n="5147">Not understood , this gift they have besides ,</l>
     <l n="5148">They show us when our foes walk not upright .</l>
     <l n="5149">So they among themselves in pleasant vein</l>
     <l n="5150">Stood scoffing , hightened in their thoughts beyond</l>
     <l n="5151">All doubt of victory : Eternal Might</l>
     <l n="5152">To match with their inventions they presumed</l>
     <l n="5153">So easy , and of his thunder made a scorn ,</l>
     <l n="5154">And all his host derided , while they stood</l>
     <l n="5155">A while in trouble : But they stood not long ;</l>
     <l n="5156">Rage prompted them at length , and found them arms</l>
     <l n="5157">Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose .</l>
     <l n="5158">Forthwith ( behold the excellence , the power ,</l>
     <l n="5159">Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed ! )</l>
     <l n="5160">Their arms away they threw , and to the hills</l>
     <l n="5161">( For Earth hath this variety from Heaven</l>
     <l n="5162">Of pleasure situate in hill and dale ,)</l>
     <l n="5163">Light as the lightning glimpse they ran , they flew ;</l>
     <l n="5164">From their foundations loosening to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="5165">They plucked the seated hills , with all their load ,</l>
     <l n="5166">Rocks , waters , woods , and by the shaggy tops</l>
     <l n="5167">Up-lifting bore them in their hands : Amaze ,</l>
     <l n="5168">Be sure , and terrour , seized the rebel host ,</l>
     <l n="5169">When coming towards them so dread they saw</l>
     <l n="5170">The bottom of the mountains upward turned ;</l>
     <l n="5171">Till on those cursed engines ’ triple-row</l>
     <l n="5172">They saw them whelmed , and all their confidence</l>
     <l n="5173">Under the weight of mountains buried deep ;</l>
     <l n="5174">Themselves invaded next , and on their heads</l>
     <l n="5175">Main promontories flung , which in the air</l>
     <l n="5176">Came shadowing , and oppressed whole legions armed ;</l>
     <l n="5177">Their armour helped their harm , crushed in and bruised</l>
     <l n="5178">Into their substance pent , which wrought them pain</l>
     <l n="5179">Implacable , and many a dolorous groan ;</l>
     <l n="5180">Long struggling underneath , ere they could wind</l>
     <l n="5181">Out of such prison , though Spirits of purest light ,</l>
     <l n="5182">Purest at first , now gross by sinning grown .</l>
     <l n="5183">The rest , in imitation , to like arms</l>
     <l n="5184">Betook them , and the neighbouring hills uptore :</l>
     <l n="5185">So hills amid the air encountered hills ,</l>
     <l n="5186">Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire ;</l>
     <l n="5187">That under ground they fought in dismal shade ;</l>
     <l n="5188">Infernal noise ! war seemed a civil game</l>
     <l n="5189">To this uproar ; horrid confusion heaped</l>
     <l n="5190">Upon confusion rose : And now all Heaven</l>
     <l n="5191">Had gone to wrack , with ruin overspread ;</l>
     <l n="5192">Had not the Almighty Father , where he sits</l>
     <l n="5193">Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure ,</l>
     <l n="5194">Consulting on the sum of things , foreseen</l>
     <l n="5195">This tumult , and permitted all , advised :</l>
     <l n="5196">That his great purpose he might so fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="5197">To honour his anointed Son avenged</l>
     <l n="5198">Upon his enemies , and to declare</l>
     <l n="5199">All power on him transferred : Whence to his Son ,</l>
     <l n="5200">The Assessour of his throne , he thus began .</l>
     <l n="5201">Effulgence of my glory , Son beloved ,</l>
     <l n="5202">Son , in whose face invisible is beheld</l>
     <l n="5203">Visibly , what by Deity I am ;</l>
     <l n="5204">And in whose hand what by decree I do ,</l>
     <l n="5205">Second Omnipotence ! two days are past ,</l>
     <l n="5206">Two days , as we compute the days of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5207">Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame</l>
     <l n="5208">These disobedient : Sore hath been their fight ,</l>
     <l n="5209">As likeliest was , when two such foes met armed ;</l>
     <l n="5210">For to themselves I left them ; and thou knowest ,</l>
     <l n="5211">Equal in their creation they were formed ,</l>
     <l n="5212">Save what sin hath impaired ; which yet hath wrought</l>
     <l n="5213">Insensibly , for I suspend their doom ;</l>
     <l n="5214">Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last</l>
     <l n="5215">Endless , and no solution will be found :</l>
     <l n="5216">War wearied hath performed what war can do ,</l>
     <l n="5217">And to disordered rage let loose the reins</l>
     <l n="5218">With mountains , as with weapons , armed ; which makes</l>
     <l n="5219">Wild work in Heaven , and dangerous to the main .</l>
     <l n="5220">Two days are therefore past , the third is thine ;</l>
     <l n="5221">For thee I have ordained it ; and thus far</l>
     <l n="5222">Have suffered , that the glory may be thine</l>
     <l n="5223">Of ending this great war , since none but Thou</l>
     <l n="5224">Can end it . Into thee such virtue and grace</l>
     <l n="5225">Immense I have transfused , that all may know</l>
     <l n="5226">In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare ;</l>
     <l n="5227">And , this perverse commotion governed thus ,</l>
     <l n="5228">To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir</l>
     <l n="5229">Of all things ; to be Heir , and to be King</l>
     <l n="5230">By sacred unction , thy deserved right .</l>
     <l n="5231">Go then , Thou Mightiest , in thy Father 's might ;</l>
     <l n="5232">Ascend my chariot , guide the rapid wheels</l>
     <l n="5233">That shake Heaven 's basis , bring forth all my war ,</l>
     <l n="5234">My bow and thunder , my almighty arms</l>
     <l n="5235">Gird on , and sword upon thy puissant thigh ;</l>
     <l n="5236">Pursue these sons of darkness , drive them out</l>
     <l n="5237">From all Heaven 's bounds into the utter deep :</l>
     <l n="5238">There let them learn , as likes them , to despise</l>
     <l n="5239">God , and Messiah his anointed King .</l>
     <l n="5240">He said , and on his Son with rays direct</l>
     <l n="5241">Shone full ; he all his Father full expressed</l>
     <l n="5242">Ineffably into his face received ;</l>
     <l n="5243">And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake .</l>
     <l n="5244">O Father , O Supreme of heavenly Thrones ,</l>
     <l n="5245">First , Highest , Holiest , Best ; thou always seek'st</l>
     <l n="5246">To glorify thy Son , I always thee ,</l>
     <l n="5247">As is most just : This I my glory account ,</l>
     <l n="5248">My exaltation , and my whole delight ,</l>
     <l n="5249">That thou , in me well pleased , declarest thy will</l>
     <l n="5250">Fulfilled , which to fulfil is all my bliss .</l>
     <l n="5251">Scepter and power , thy giving , I assume ,</l>
     <l n="5252">And gladlier shall resign , when in the end</l>
     <l n="5253">Thou shalt be all in all , and I in thee</l>
     <l n="5254">For ever ; and in me all whom thou lovest :</l>
     <l n="5255">But whom thou hatest , I hate , and can put on</l>
     <l n="5256">Thy terrours , as I put thy mildness on ,</l>
     <l n="5257">Image of thee in all things ; and shall soon ,</l>
     <l n="5258">Armed with thy might , rid Heaven of these rebelled ;</l>
     <l n="5259">To their prepared ill mansion driven down ,</l>
     <l n="5260">To chains of darkness , and the undying worm ;</l>
     <l n="5261">That from thy just obedience could revolt ,</l>
     <l n="5262">Whom to obey is happiness entire .</l>
     <l n="5263">Then shall thy Saints unmixed , and from the impure</l>
     <l n="5264">Far separate , circling thy holy mount ,</l>
     <l n="5265">Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing ,</l>
     <l n="5266">Hymns of high praise , and I among them Chief .</l>
     <l n="5267">So said , he , o'er his scepter bowing , rose</l>
     <l n="5268">From the right hand of Glory where he sat ;</l>
     <l n="5269">And the third sacred morn began to shine ,</l>
     <l n="5270">Dawning through Heaven . Forth rushed with whirlwind sound</l>
     <l n="5271">The chariot of Paternal Deity ,</l>
     <l n="5272">Flashing thick flames , wheel within wheel undrawn ,</l>
     <l n="5273">Itself instinct with Spirit , but convoyed</l>
     <l n="5274">By four Cherubick shapes ; four faces each</l>
     <l n="5275">Had wonderous ; as with stars , their bodies all</l>
     <l n="5276">And wings were set with eyes ; with eyes the wheels</l>
     <l n="5277">Of beryl , and careering fires between ;</l>
     <l n="5278">Over their heads a crystal firmament ,</l>
     <l n="5279">Whereon a sapphire throne , inlaid with pure</l>
     <l n="5280">Amber , and colours of the showery arch .</l>
     <l n="5281">He , in celestial panoply all armed</l>
     <l n="5282">Of radiant Urim , work divinely wrought ,</l>
     <l n="5283">Ascended ; at his right hand Victory</l>
     <l n="5284">Sat eagle-winged ; beside him hung his bow</l>
     <l n="5285">And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored ;</l>
     <l n="5286">And from about him fierce effusion rolled</l>
     <l n="5287">Of smoke , and bickering flame , and sparkles dire :</l>
     <l n="5288">Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints ,</l>
     <l n="5289">He onward came ; far off his coming shone ;</l>
     <l n="5290">And twenty thousand ( I their number heard )</l>
     <l n="5291">Chariots of God , half on each hand , were seen ;</l>
     <l n="5292">He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime</l>
     <l n="5293">On the crystalline sky , in sapphire throned ,</l>
     <l n="5294">Illustrious far and wide ; but by his own</l>
     <l n="5295">First seen : Them unexpected joy surprised ,</l>
     <l n="5296">When the great ensign of Messiah blazed</l>
     <l n="5297">Aloft by Angels borne , his sign in Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="5298">Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced</l>
     <l n="5299">His army , circumfused on either wing ,</l>
     <l n="5300">Under their Head imbodied all in one .</l>
     <l n="5301">Before him Power Divine his way prepared ;</l>
     <l n="5302">At his command the uprooted hills retired</l>
     <l n="5303">Each to his place ; they heard his voice , and went</l>
     <l n="5304">Obsequious ; Heaven his wonted face renewed ,</l>
     <l n="5305">And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled .</l>
     <l n="5306">This saw his hapless foes , but stood obdured ,</l>
     <l n="5307">And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers ,</l>
     <l n="5308">Insensate , hope conceiving from despair .</l>
     <l n="5309">In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell ?</l>
     <l n="5310">But to convince the proud what signs avail ,</l>
     <l n="5311">Or wonders move the obdurate to relent ?</l>
     <l n="5312">They , hardened more by what might most reclaim ,</l>
     <l n="5313">Grieving to see his glory , at the sight</l>
     <l n="5314">Took envy ; and , aspiring to his highth ,</l>
     <l n="5315">Stood re-embattled fierce , by force or fraud</l>
     <l n="5316">Weening to prosper , and at length prevail</l>
     <l n="5317">Against God and Messiah , or to fall</l>
     <l n="5318">In universal ruin last ; and now</l>
     <l n="5319">To final battle drew , disdaining flight ,</l>
     <l n="5320">Or faint retreat ; when the great Son of God</l>
     <l n="5321">To all his host on either hand thus spake .</l>
     <l n="5322">Stand still in bright array , ye Saints ; here stand ,</l>
     <l n="5323">Ye Angels armed ; this day from battle rest :</l>
     <l n="5324">Faithful hath been your warfare , and of God</l>
     <l n="5325">Accepted , fearless in his righteous cause ;</l>
     <l n="5326">And as ye have received , so have ye done ,</l>
     <l n="5327">Invincibly : But of this cursed crew</l>
     <l n="5328">The punishment to other hand belongs ;</l>
     <l n="5329">Vengeance is his , or whose he sole appoints :</l>
     <l n="5330">Number to this day 's work is not ordained ,</l>
     <l n="5331">Nor multitude ; stand only , and behold</l>
     <l n="5332">God 's indignation on these godless poured</l>
     <l n="5333">By me ; not you , but me , they have despised ,</l>
     <l n="5334">Yet envied ; against me is all their rage ,</l>
     <l n="5335">Because the Father , to whom in Heaven s'preme</l>
     <l n="5336">Kingdom , and power , and glory appertains ,</l>
     <l n="5337">Hath honoured me , according to his will .</l>
     <l n="5338">Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned ;</l>
     <l n="5339">That they may have their wish , to try with me</l>
     <l n="5340">In battle which the stronger proves ; they all ,</l>
     <l n="5341">Or I alone against them ; since by strength</l>
     <l n="5342">They measure all , of other excellence</l>
     <l n="5343">Not emulous , nor care who them excels ;</l>
     <l n="5344">Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe .</l>
     <l n="5345">So spake the Son , and into terrour changed</l>
     <l n="5346">His countenance too severe to be beheld ,</l>
     <l n="5347">And full of wrath bent on his enemies .</l>
     <l n="5348">At once the Four spread out their starry wings</l>
     <l n="5349">With dreadful shade contiguous , and the orbs</l>
     <l n="5350">Of his fierce chariot rolled , as with the sound</l>
     <l n="5351">Of torrent floods , or of a numerous host .</l>
     <l n="5352">He on his impious foes right onward drove ,</l>
     <l n="5353">Gloomy as night ; under his burning wheels</l>
     <l n="5354">The stedfast empyrean shook throughout ,</l>
     <l n="5355">All but the throne itself of God . Full soon</l>
     <l n="5356">Among them he arrived ; in his right hand</l>
     <l n="5357">Grasping ten thousand thunders , which he sent</l>
     <l n="5358">Before him , such as in their souls infixed</l>
     <l n="5359">Plagues : They , astonished , all resistance lost ,</l>
     <l n="5360">All courage ; down their idle weapons dropt :</l>
     <l n="5361">O'er shields , and helms , and helmed heads he rode</l>
     <l n="5362">Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate ,</l>
     <l n="5363">That wished the mountains now might be again</l>
     <l n="5364">Thrown on them , as a shelter from his ire .</l>
     <l n="5365">Nor less on either side tempestuous fell</l>
     <l n="5366">His arrows , from the fourfold-visaged Four</l>
     <l n="5367">Distinct with eyes , and from the living wheels</l>
     <l n="5368">Distinct alike with multitude of eyes ;</l>
     <l n="5369">One Spirit in them ruled ; and every eye</l>
     <l n="5370">Glared lightning , and shot forth pernicious fire</l>
     <l n="5371">Among the accursed , that withered all their strength ,</l>
     <l n="5372">And of their wonted vigour left them drained ,</l>
     <l n="5373">Exhausted , spiritless , afflicted , fallen .</l>
     <l n="5374">Yet half his strength he put not forth , but checked</l>
     <l n="5375">His thunder in mid volley ; for he meant</l>
     <l n="5376">Not to destroy , but root them out of Heaven :</l>
     <l n="5377">The overthrown he raised , and as a herd</l>
     <l n="5378">Of goats or timorous flock together thronged</l>
     <l n="5379">Drove them before him thunder-struck , pursued</l>
     <l n="5380">With terrours , and with furies , to the bounds</l>
     <l n="5381">And crystal wall of Heaven ; which , opening wide ,</l>
     <l n="5382">Rolled inward , and a spacious gap disclosed</l>
     <l n="5383">Into the wasteful deep : The monstrous sight</l>
     <l n="5384">Struck them with horrour backward , but far worse</l>
     <l n="5385">Urged them behind : Headlong themselves they threw</l>
     <l n="5386">Down from the verge of Heaven ; eternal wrath</l>
     <l n="5387">Burnt after them to the bottomless pit .</l>
     <l n="5388">Hell heard the unsufferable noise , Hell saw</l>
     <l n="5389">Heaven ruining from Heaven , and would have fled</l>
     <l n="5390">Affrighted ; but strict Fate had cast too deep</l>
     <l n="5391">Her dark foundations , and too fast had bound .</l>
     <l n="5392">Nine days they fell : Confounded Chaos roared ,</l>
     <l n="5393">And felt tenfold confusion in their fall</l>
     <l n="5394">Through his wild anarchy , so huge a rout</l>
     <l n="5395">Incumbered him with ruin : Hell at last</l>
     <l n="5396">Yawning received them whole , and on them closed ;</l>
     <l n="5397">Hell , their fit habitation , fraught with fire</l>
     <l n="5398">Unquenchable , the house of woe and pain .</l>
     <l n="5399">Disburdened Heaven rejoiced , and soon repaired</l>
     <l n="5400">Her mural breach , returning whence it rolled .</l>
     <l n="5401">Sole victor , from the expulsion of his foes ,</l>
     <l n="5402">Messiah his triumphal chariot turned :</l>
     <l n="5403">To meet him all his Saints , who silent stood</l>
     <l n="5404">Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts ,</l>
     <l n="5405">With jubilee advanced ; and , as they went ,</l>
     <l n="5406">Shaded with branching palm , each Order bright ,</l>
     <l n="5407">Sung triumph , and him sung victorious King ,</l>
     <l n="5408">Son , Heir , and Lord , to him dominion given ,</l>
     <l n="5409">Worthiest to reign : He , celebrated , rode</l>
     <l n="5410">Triumphant through mid Heaven , into the courts</l>
     <l n="5411">And temple of his Mighty Father throned</l>
     <l n="5412">On high ; who into glory him received ,</l>
     <l n="5413">Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss .</l>
     <l n="5414">Thus , measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth ,</l>
     <l n="5415">At thy request , and that thou mayest beware</l>
     <l n="5416">By what is past , to thee I have revealed</l>
     <l n="5417">What might have else to human race been hid ;</l>
     <l n="5418">The discord which befel , and war in Heaven</l>
     <l n="5419">Among the angelick Powers , and the deep fall</l>
     <l n="5420">Of those too high aspiring , who rebelled</l>
     <l n="5421">With Satan ; he who envies now thy state ,</l>
     <l n="5422">Who now is plotting how he may seduce</l>
     <l n="5423">Thee also from obedience , that , with him</l>
     <l n="5424">Bereaved of happiness , thou mayest partake</l>
     <l n="5425">His punishment , eternal misery ;</l>
     <l n="5426">Which would be all his solace and revenge ,</l>
     <l n="5427">As a despite done against the Most High ,</l>
     <l n="5428">Thee once to gain companion of his woe .</l>
     <l n="5429">But listen not to his temptations , warn</l>
     <l n="5430">Thy weaker ; let it profit thee to have heard ,</l>
     <l n="5431">By terrible example , the reward</l>
     <l n="5432">Of disobedience ; firm they might have stood ,</l>
     <l n="5433">Yet fell ; remember , and fear to transgress .</l>

     <l n="5437">Following , above the Olympian hill I soar ,</l>
     <l n="5438">Above the flight of Pegasean wing !</l>
     <l n="5439">The meaning , not the name , I call : for thou</l>
     <l n="5440">Nor of the Muses nine , nor on the top</l>
     <l n="5441">Of old Olympus dwellest ; but , heavenly-born ,</l>
     <l n="5442">Before the hills appeared , or fountain flowed ,</l>
     <l n="5443">Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse ,</l>

     <l n="5447">Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed ,</l>
     <l n="5448">An earthly guest , and drawn empyreal air ,</l>

     <l n="5460">On evil days though fallen , and evil tongues ;</l>
     <l n="5461">In darkness , and with dangers compassed round ,</l>

     <l n="5468">Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard</l>
     <l n="5469">In Rhodope , where woods and rocks had ears</l>
     <l n="5470">To rapture , till the savage clamour drowned</l>
     <l n="5471">Both harp and voice ; nor could the Muse defend</l>

     <l n="5481">If they transgress , and slight that sole command ,</l>

     <l n="5488">So unimaginable , as hate in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5489">And war so near the peace of God in bliss ,</l>
     <l n="5490">With such confusion : but the evil , soon</l>
     <l n="5491">Driven back , redounded as a flood on those</l>
     <l n="5492">From whom it sprung ; impossible to mix</l>
     <l n="5493">With blessedness . Whence Adam soon repealed</l>
     <l n="5494">The doubts that in his heart arose : and now</l>

     <l n="5498">When , and whereof created ; for what cause ;</l>
     <l n="5499">What within Eden , or without , was done</l>

     <l n="5503">Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest .</l>
     <l n="5504">Great things , and full of wonder in our ears ,</l>
     <l n="5505">Far differing from this world , thou hast revealed ,</l>

     <l n="5507">Down from the empyrean , to forewarn</l>
     <l n="5508">Us timely of what might else have been our loss ,</l>
     <l n="5509">Unknown , which human knowledge could not reach ;</l>
     <l n="5510">For which to the infinitely Good we owe</l>
     <l n="5511">Immortal thanks , and his admonishment</l>
     <l n="5512">Receive , with solemn purpose to observe</l>
     <l n="5513">Immutably his sovran will , the end</l>
     <l n="5514">Of what we are . But since thou hast vouchsafed</l>
     <l n="5515">Gently , for our instruction , to impart</l>
     <l n="5516">Things above earthly thought , which yet concerned</l>
     <l n="5517">Our knowing , as to highest wisdom seemed ,</l>
     <l n="5518">Deign to descend now lower , and relate</l>
     <l n="5519">What may no less perhaps avail us known ,</l>
     <l n="5520">How first began this Heaven which we behold</l>
     <l n="5521">Distant so high , with moving fires adorned</l>
     <l n="5522">Innumerable ; and this which yields or fills</l>
     <l n="5523">All space , the ambient air wide interfused</l>
     <l n="5524">Embracing round this floried Earth ; what cause</l>
     <l n="5525">Moved the Creator , in his holy rest</l>
     <l n="5526">Through all eternity , so late to build</l>
     <l n="5527">In Chaos ; and the work begun , how soon</l>
     <l n="5528">Absolved ; if unforbid thou mayest unfold</l>
     <l n="5529">What we , not to explore the secrets ask</l>
     <l n="5530">Of his eternal empire , but the more</l>
     <l n="5531">To magnify his works , the more we know .</l>
     <l n="5532">And the great light of day yet wants to run</l>
     <l n="5533">Much of his race though steep ; suspense in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5534">Held by thy voice , thy potent voice , he hears ,</l>
     <l n="5535">And longer will delay to hear thee tell</l>
     <l n="5536">His generation , and the rising birth</l>
     <l n="5537">Of Nature from the unapparent Deep :</l>
     <l n="5538">Or if the star of evening and the moon</l>
     <l n="5539">Haste to thy audience , Night with her will bring ,</l>
     <l n="5540">Silence ; and Sleep , listening to thee , will watch ;</l>
     <l n="5541">Or we can bid his absence , till thy song</l>
     <l n="5542">End , and dismiss thee ere the morning shine .</l>
     <l n="5543">Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought :</l>
     <l n="5544">And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild .</l>
     <l n="5545">This also thy request , with caution asked ,</l>
     <l n="5546">Obtain ; though to recount almighty works</l>
     <l n="5547">What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice ,</l>
     <l n="5548">Or heart of man suffice to comprehend ?</l>
     <l n="5549">Yet what thou canst attain , which best may serve</l>
     <l n="5550">To glorify the Maker , and infer</l>
     <l n="5551">Thee also happier , shall not be withheld</l>
     <l n="5552">Thy hearing ; such commission from above</l>
     <l n="5553">I have received , to answer thy desire</l>
     <l n="5554">Of knowledge within bounds ; beyond , abstain</l>
     <l n="5555">To ask ; nor let thine own inventions hope</l>
     <l n="5556">Things not revealed , which the invisible King ,</l>
     <l n="5557">Only Omniscient , hath suppressed in night ;</l>
     <l n="5558">To none communicable in Earth or Heaven :</l>
     <l n="5559">Enough is left besides to search and know .</l>
     <l n="5560">But knowledge is as food , and needs no less</l>
     <l n="5561">Her temperance over appetite , to know</l>
     <l n="5562">In measure what the mind may well contain ;</l>
     <l n="5563">Oppresses else with surfeit , and soon turns</l>
     <l n="5564">Wisdom to folly , as nourishment to wind .</l>
     <l n="5565">Know then , that , after Lucifer from Heaven</l>
     <l n="5566">( So call him , brighter once amidst the host</l>
     <l n="5567">Of Angels , than that star the stars among ,)</l>
     <l n="5568">Fell with his flaming legions through the deep</l>
     <l n="5569">Into his place , and the great Son returned</l>
     <l n="5570">Victorious with his Saints , the Omnipotent</l>
     <l n="5571">Eternal Father from his throne beheld</l>
     <l n="5572">Their multitude , and to his Son thus spake .</l>
     <l n="5573">At least our envious Foe hath failed , who thought</l>
     <l n="5574">All like himself rebellious , by whose aid</l>
     <l n="5575">This inaccessible high strength , the seat</l>
     <l n="5576">Of Deity supreme , us dispossessed ,</l>
     <l n="5577">He trusted to have seised , and into fraud</l>
     <l n="5578">Drew many , whom their place knows here no more :</l>
     <l n="5579">Yet far the greater part have kept , I see ,</l>
     <l n="5580">Their station ; Heaven , yet populous , retains</l>
     <l n="5581">Number sufficient to possess her realms</l>
     <l n="5582">Though wide , and this high temple to frequent</l>
     <l n="5583">With ministeries due , and solemn rites :</l>
     <l n="5584">But , lest his heart exalt him in the harm</l>
     <l n="5585">Already done , to have dispeopled Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5586">My damage fondly deemed , I can repair</l>
     <l n="5587">That detriment , if such it be to lose</l>
     <l n="5588">Self-lost ; and in a moment will create</l>
     <l n="5589">Another world , out of one man a race</l>
     <l n="5590">Of men innumerable , there to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="5591">Not here ; till , by degrees of merit raised ,</l>
     <l n="5592">They open to themselves at length the way</l>
     <l n="5593">Up hither , under long obedience tried ;</l>
     <l n="5594">And Earth be changed to Heaven , and Heaven to Earth ,</l>
     <l n="5595">One kingdom , joy and union without end .</l>
     <l n="5596">Mean while inhabit lax , ye Powers of Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="5597">And thou my Word , begotten Son , by thee</l>
     <l n="5598">This I perform ; speak thou , and be it done !</l>
     <l n="5599">My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee</l>
     <l n="5600">I send along ; ride forth , and bid the Deep</l>
     <l n="5601">Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth ;</l>
     <l n="5602">Boundless the Deep , because I Am who fill</l>
     <l n="5603">Infinitude , nor vacuous the space .</l>
     <l n="5604">Though I , uncircumscribed myself , retire ,</l>
     <l n="5605">And put not forth my goodness , which is free</l>
     <l n="5606">To act or not , Necessity and Chance</l>
     <l n="5607">Approach not me , and what I will is Fate .</l>
     <l n="5608">So spake the Almighty , and to what he spake</l>
     <l n="5609">His Word , the Filial Godhead , gave effect .</l>
     <l n="5610">Immediate are the acts of God , more swift</l>
     <l n="5611">Than time or motion , but to human ears</l>
     <l n="5612">Cannot without process of speech be told ,</l>
     <l n="5613">So told as earthly notion can receive .</l>
     <l n="5614">Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5615">When such was heard declared the Almighty 's will ;</l>
     <l n="5616">Glory they sung to the Most High , good will</l>
     <l n="5617">To future men , and in their dwellings peace ;</l>
     <l n="5618">Glory to Him , whose just avenging ire</l>
     <l n="5619">Had driven out the ungodly from his sight</l>
     <l n="5620">And the habitations of the just ; to Him</l>
     <l n="5621">Glory and praise , whose wisdom had ordained</l>
     <l n="5622">Good out of evil to create ; instead</l>
     <l n="5623">Of Spirits malign , a better race to bring</l>
     <l n="5624">Into their vacant room , and thence diffuse</l>
     <l n="5625">His good to worlds and ages infinite .</l>
     <l n="5626">So sang the Hierarchies : Mean while the Son</l>
     <l n="5627">On his great expedition now appeared ,</l>
     <l n="5628">Girt with Omnipotence , with radiance crowned</l>
     <l n="5629">Of Majesty Divine ; sapience and love</l>
     <l n="5630">Immense , and all his Father in him shone .</l>
     <l n="5631">About his chariot numberless were poured</l>
     <l n="5632">Cherub , and Seraph , Potentates , and Thrones ,</l>
     <l n="5633">And Virtues , winged Spirits , and chariots winged</l>
     <l n="5634">From the armoury of God ; where stand of old</l>
     <l n="5635">Myriads , between two brazen mountains lodged</l>
     <l n="5636">Against a solemn day , harnessed at hand ,</l>
     <l n="5637">Celestial equipage ; and now came forth</l>
     <l n="5638">Spontaneous , for within them Spirit lived ,</l>
     <l n="5639">Attendant on their Lord : Heaven opened wide</l>
     <l n="5640">Her ever-during gates , harmonious sound</l>
     <l n="5641">On golden hinges moving , to let forth</l>
     <l n="5642">The King of Glory , in his powerful Word</l>
     <l n="5643">And Spirit , coming to create new worlds .</l>
     <l n="5644">On heavenly ground they stood ; and from the shore</l>
     <l n="5645">They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss</l>
     <l n="5646">Outrageous as a sea , dark , wasteful , wild ,</l>
     <l n="5647">Up from the bottom turned by furious winds</l>
     <l n="5648">And surging waves , as mountains , to assault</l>
     <l n="5649">Heaven 's highth , and with the center mix the pole .</l>
     <l n="5650">Silence , ye troubled Waves , and thou Deep , peace ,</l>
     <l n="5651">Said then the Omnifick Word ; your discord end !</l>
     <l n="5652">Nor staid ; but , on the wings of Cherubim</l>
     <l n="5653">Uplifted , in paternal glory rode</l>
     <l n="5654">Far into Chaos , and the world unborn ;</l>
     <l n="5655">For Chaos heard his voice : Him all his train</l>
     <l n="5656">Followed in bright procession , to behold</l>
     <l n="5657">Creation , and the wonders of his might .</l>
     <l n="5658">Then staid the fervid wheels , and in his hand</l>
     <l n="5659">He took the golden compasses , prepared</l>
     <l n="5660">In God 's eternal store , to circumscribe</l>
     <l n="5661">This universe , and all created things :</l>
     <l n="5662">One foot he centered , and the other turned</l>
     <l n="5663">Round through the vast profundity obscure ;</l>
     <l n="5664">And said , Thus far extend , thus far thy bounds ,</l>
     <l n="5665">This be thy just circumference , O World !</l>
     <l n="5666">Thus God the Heaven created , thus the Earth ,</l>
     <l n="5667">Matter unformed and void : Darkness profound</l>
     <l n="5668">Covered the abyss : but on the watery calm</l>
     <l n="5669">His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread ,</l>
     <l n="5670">And vital virtue infused , and vital warmth</l>
     <l n="5671">Throughout the fluid mass ; but downward purged</l>
     <l n="5672">The black tartareous cold infernal dregs ,</l>
     <l n="5673">Adverse to life : then founded , then conglobed</l>
     <l n="5674">Like things to like ; the rest to several place</l>
     <l n="5675">Disparted , and between spun out the air ;</l>
     <l n="5676">And Earth self-balanced on her center hung .</l>
     <l n="5677">Let there be light , said God ; and forthwith Light</l>
     <l n="5678">Ethereal , first of things , quintessence pure ,</l>
     <l n="5679">Sprung from the deep ; and from her native east</l>
     <l n="5680">To journey through the aery gloom began ,</l>
     <l n="5681">Sphered in a radiant cloud , for yet the sun</l>
     <l n="5682">Was not ; she in a cloudy tabernacle</l>
     <l n="5683">Sojourned the while . God saw the light was good ;</l>
     <l n="5684">And light from darkness by the hemisphere</l>
     <l n="5685">Divided : light the Day , and darkness Night ,</l>
     <l n="5686">He named . Thus was the first day even and morn :</l>
     <l n="5687">Nor past uncelebrated , nor unsung</l>
     <l n="5688">By the celestial quires , when orient light</l>
     <l n="5689">Exhaling first from darkness they beheld ;</l>
     <l n="5690">Birth-day of Heaven and Earth ; with joy and shout</l>
     <l n="5691">The hollow universal orb they filled ,</l>
     <l n="5692">And touched their golden harps , and hymning praised</l>
     <l n="5693">God and his works ; Creator him they sung ,</l>
     <l n="5694">Both when first evening was , and when first morn .</l>
     <l n="5695">Again , God said , Let there be firmament</l>
     <l n="5696">Amid the waters , and let it divide</l>
     <l n="5697">The waters from the waters ; and God made</l>
     <l n="5698">The firmament , expanse of liquid , pure ,</l>
     <l n="5699">Transparent , elemental air , diffused</l>
     <l n="5700">In circuit to the uttermost convex</l>
     <l n="5701">Of this great round ; partition firm and sure ,</l>
     <l n="5702">The waters underneath from those above</l>
     <l n="5703">Dividing : for as earth , so he the world</l>
     <l n="5704">Built on circumfluous waters calm , in wide</l>
     <l n="5705">Crystalline ocean , and the loud misrule</l>
     <l n="5706">Of Chaos far removed ; lest fierce extremes</l>
     <l n="5707">Contiguous might distemper the whole frame :</l>
     <l n="5708">And Heaven he named the Firmament : So even</l>
     <l n="5709">And morning chorus sung the second day .</l>
     <l n="5710">The Earth was formed , but in the womb as yet</l>
     <l n="5711">Of waters , embryon immature involved ,</l>
     <l n="5712">Appeared not : over all the face of Earth</l>
     <l n="5713">Main ocean flowed , not idle ; but , with warm</l>
     <l n="5714">Prolifick humour softening all her globe ,</l>
     <l n="5715">Fermented the great mother to conceive ,</l>
     <l n="5716">Satiate with genial moisture ; when God said ,</l>
     <l n="5717">Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven</l>
     <l n="5718">Into one place , and let dry land appear .</l>
     <l n="5719">Immediately the mountains huge appear</l>
     <l n="5720">Emergent , and their broad bare backs upheave</l>
     <l n="5721">Into the clouds ; their tops ascend the sky :</l>
     <l n="5722">So high as heaved the tumid hills , so low</l>
     <l n="5723">Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep ,</l>
     <l n="5724">Capacious bed of waters : Thither they</l>
     <l n="5725">Hasted with glad precipitance , uprolled ,</l>
     <l n="5726">As drops on dust conglobing from the dry :</l>
     <l n="5727">Part rise in crystal wall , or ridge direct ,</l>
     <l n="5728">For haste ; such flight the great command impressed</l>
     <l n="5729">On the swift floods : As armies at the call</l>
     <l n="5730">Of trumpet ( for of armies thou hast heard )</l>
     <l n="5731">Troop to their standard ; so the watery throng ,</l>
     <l n="5732">Wave rolling after wave , where way they found ,</l>
     <l n="5733">If steep , with torrent rapture , if through plain ,</l>
     <l n="5734">Soft-ebbing ; nor withstood them rock or hill ;</l>
     <l n="5735">But they , or under ground , or circuit wide</l>
     <l n="5736">With serpent errour wandering , found their way ,</l>
     <l n="5737">And on the washy oose deep channels wore ;</l>
     <l n="5738">Easy , ere God had bid the ground be dry ,</l>
     <l n="5739">All but within those banks , where rivers now</l>
     <l n="5740">Stream , and perpetual draw their humid train .</l>
     <l n="5741">The dry land , Earth ; and the great receptacle</l>
     <l n="5742">Of congregated waters , he called Seas :</l>
     <l n="5743">And saw that it was good ; and said , Let the Earth</l>
     <l n="5744">Put forth the verdant grass , herb yielding seed ,</l>
     <l n="5745">And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind ,</l>
     <l n="5746">Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth .</l>
     <l n="5747">He scarce had said , when the bare Earth , till then</l>
     <l n="5748">Desart and bare , unsightly , unadorned ,</l>
     <l n="5749">Brought forth the tender grass , whose verdure clad</l>
     <l n="5750">Her universal face with pleasant green ;</l>
     <l n="5751">Then herbs of every leaf , that sudden flowered</l>
     <l n="5752">Opening their various colours , and made gay</l>
     <l n="5753">Her bosom , smelling sweet : and , these scarce blown ,</l>
     <l n="5754">Forth flourished thick the clustering vine , forth crept</l>
     <l n="5755">The swelling gourd , up stood the corny reed</l>
     <l n="5756">Embattled in her field , and the humble shrub ,</l>
     <l n="5757">And bush with frizzled hair implicit : Last</l>
     <l n="5758">Rose , as in dance , the stately trees , and spread</l>
     <l n="5759">Their branches hung with copious fruit , or gemmed</l>
     <l n="5760">Their blossoms : With high woods the hills were crowned ;</l>
     <l n="5761">With tufts the valleys , and each fountain side ;</l>
     <l n="5762">With borders long the rivers : that Earth now</l>
     <l n="5763">Seemed like to Heaven , a seat where Gods might dwell ,</l>
     <l n="5764">Or wander with delight , and love to haunt</l>
     <l n="5765">Her sacred shades : though God had yet not rained</l>
     <l n="5766">Upon the Earth , and man to till the ground</l>
     <l n="5767">None was ; but from the Earth a dewy mist</l>
     <l n="5768">Went up , and watered all the ground , and each</l>
     <l n="5769">Plant of the field ; which , ere it was in the Earth ,</l>
     <l n="5770">God made , and every herb , before it grew</l>
     <l n="5771">On the green stem : God saw that it was good :</l>
     <l n="5772">So even and morn recorded the third day .</l>
     <l n="5773">Again the Almighty spake , Let there be lights</l>
     <l n="5774">High in the expanse of Heaven , to divide</l>
     <l n="5775">The day from night ; and let them be for signs ,</l>
     <l n="5776">For seasons , and for days , and circling years ;</l>
     <l n="5777">And let them be for lights , as I ordain</l>
     <l n="5778">Their office in the firmament of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5779">To give light on the Earth ; and it was so .</l>
     <l n="5780">And God made two great lights , great for their use</l>
     <l n="5781">To Man , the greater to have rule by day ,</l>
     <l n="5782">The less by night , altern ; and made the stars ,</l>
     <l n="5783">And set them in the firmament of Heaven</l>
     <l n="5784">To illuminate the Earth , and rule the day</l>
     <l n="5785">In their vicissitude , and rule the night ,</l>
     <l n="5786">And light from darkness to divide . God saw ,</l>
     <l n="5787">Surveying his great work , that it was good :</l>
     <l n="5788">For of celestial bodies first the sun</l>
     <l n="5789">A mighty sphere he framed , unlightsome first ,</l>
     <l n="5790">Though of ethereal mould : then formed the moon</l>
     <l n="5791">Globose , and every magnitude of stars ,</l>
     <l n="5792">And sowed with stars the Heaven , thick as a field :</l>
     <l n="5793">Of light by far the greater part he took ,</l>
     <l n="5794">Transplanted from her cloudy shrine , and placed</l>
     <l n="5795">In the sun 's orb , made porous to receive</l>
     <l n="5796">And drink the liquid light ; firm to retain</l>
     <l n="5797">Her gathered beams , great palace now of light .</l>
     <l n="5798">Hither , as to their fountain , other stars</l>
     <l n="5799">Repairing , in their golden urns draw light ,</l>
     <l n="5800">And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns ;</l>
     <l n="5801">By tincture or reflection they augment</l>
     <l n="5802">Their small peculiar , though from human sight</l>
     <l n="5803">So far remote , with diminution seen ,</l>
     <l n="5804">First in his east the glorious lamp was seen ,</l>
     <l n="5805">Regent of day , and all the horizon round</l>
     <l n="5806">Invested with bright rays , jocund to run</l>
     <l n="5807">His longitude through Heaven 's high road ; the gray</l>
     <l n="5808">Dawn , and the Pleiades , before him danced ,</l>
     <l n="5809">Shedding sweet influence : Less bright the moon ,</l>
     <l n="5810">But opposite in levelled west was set ,</l>
     <l n="5811">His mirrour , with full face borrowing her light</l>
     <l n="5812">From him ; for other light she needed none</l>
     <l n="5813">In that aspect , and still that distance keeps</l>
     <l n="5814">Till night ; then in the east her turn she shines ,</l>
     <l n="5815">Revolved on Heaven 's great axle , and her reign</l>
     <l n="5816">With thousand lesser lights dividual holds ,</l>
     <l n="5817">With thousand thousand stars , that then appeared</l>
     <l n="5818">Spangling the hemisphere : Then first adorned</l>
     <l n="5819">With their bright luminaries that set and rose ,</l>
     <l n="5820">Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day .</l>
     <l n="5821">And God said , Let the waters generate</l>
     <l n="5822">Reptile with spawn abundant , living soul :</l>
     <l n="5823">And let fowl fly above the Earth , with wings</l>
     <l n="5824">Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="5825">And God created the great whales , and each</l>
     <l n="5826">Soul living , each that crept , which plenteously</l>
     <l n="5827">The waters generated by their kinds ;</l>
     <l n="5828">And every bird of wing after his kind ;</l>
     <l n="5829">And saw that it was good , and blessed them , saying .</l>
     <l n="5830">Be fruitful , multiply , and in the seas ,</l>
     <l n="5831">And lakes , and running streams , the waters fill ;</l>
     <l n="5832">And let the fowl be multiplied , on the Earth .</l>
     <l n="5833">Forthwith the sounds and seas , each creek and bay ,</l>
     <l n="5834">With fry innumerable swarm , and shoals</l>
     <l n="5835">Of fish that with their fins , and shining scales ,</l>
     <l n="5836">Glide under the green wave , in sculls that oft</l>
     <l n="5837">Bank the mid sea : part single , or with mate ,</l>
     <l n="5838">Graze the sea-weed their pasture , and through groves</l>
     <l n="5839">Of coral stray ; or , sporting with quick glance ,</l>
     <l n="5840">Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold ;</l>
     <l n="5841">Or , in their pearly shells at ease , attend</l>
     <l n="5842">Moist nutriment ; or under rocks their food</l>
     <l n="5843">In jointed armour watch : on smooth the seal</l>
     <l n="5844">And bended dolphins play : part huge of bulk</l>
     <l n="5845">Wallowing unwieldy , enormous in their gait ,</l>
     <l n="5846">Tempest the ocean : there leviathan ,</l>
     <l n="5847">Hugest of living creatures , on the deep</l>
     <l n="5848">Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims ,</l>
     <l n="5849">And seems a moving land ; and at his gills</l>
     <l n="5850">Draws in , and at his trunk spouts out , a sea .</l>
     <l n="5851">Mean while the tepid caves , and fens , and shores ,</l>
     <l n="5852">Their brood as numerous hatch , from the egg that soon</l>
     <l n="5853">Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed</l>
     <l n="5854">Their callow young ; but feathered soon and fledge</l>
     <l n="5855">They summed their pens ; and , soaring the air sublime ,</l>
     <l n="5856">With clang despised the ground , under a cloud</l>
     <l n="5857">In prospect ; there the eagle and the stork</l>
     <l n="5858">On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build :</l>
     <l n="5859">Part loosely wing the region , part more wise</l>
     <l n="5860">In common , ranged in figure , wedge their way ,</l>
     <l n="5861">Intelligent of seasons , and set forth</l>
     <l n="5862">Their aery caravan , high over seas</l>
     <l n="5863">Flying , and over lands , with mutual wing</l>
     <l n="5864">Easing their flight ; so steers the prudent crane</l>
     <l n="5865">Her annual voyage , borne on winds ; the air</l>
     <l n="5866">Floats as they pass , fanned with unnumbered plumes :</l>
     <l n="5867">From branch to branch the smaller birds with song</l>
     <l n="5868">Solaced the woods , and spread their painted wings</l>
     <l n="5869">Till even ; nor then the solemn nightingale</l>
     <l n="5870">Ceased warbling , but all night tun 'd her soft lays :</l>
     <l n="5871">Others , on silver lakes and rivers , bathed</l>
     <l n="5872">Their downy breast ; the swan with arched neck ,</l>
     <l n="5873">Between her white wings mantling proudly , rows</l>
     <l n="5874">Her state with oary feet ; yet oft they quit</l>
     <l n="5875">The dank , and , rising on stiff pennons , tower</l>
     <l n="5876">The mid aereal sky : Others on ground</l>
     <l n="5877">Walked firm ; the crested cock whose clarion sounds</l>
     <l n="5878">The silent hours , and the other whose gay train</l>
     <l n="5879">Adorns him , coloured with the florid hue</l>
     <l n="5880">Of rainbows and starry eyes . The waters thus</l>
     <l n="5881">With fish replenished , and the air with fowl ,</l>
     <l n="5882">Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day .</l>
     <l n="5883">The sixth , and of creation last , arose</l>
     <l n="5884">With evening harps and matin ; when God said ,</l>
     <l n="5885">Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind ,</l>
     <l n="5886">Cattle , and creeping things , and beast of the Earth ,</l>
     <l n="5887">Each in their kind . The Earth obeyed , and straight</l>
     <l n="5888">Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth</l>
     <l n="5889">Innumerous living creatures , perfect forms ,</l>
     <l n="5890">Limbed and full grown : Out of the ground up rose ,</l>
     <l n="5891">As from his lair , the wild beast where he wons</l>
     <l n="5892">In forest wild , in thicket , brake , or den ;</l>
     <l n="5893">Among the trees in pairs they rose , they walked :</l>
     <l n="5894">The cattle in the fields and meadows green :</l>
     <l n="5895">Those rare and solitary , these in flocks</l>
     <l n="5896">Pasturing at once , and in broad herds upsprung .</l>
     <l n="5897">The grassy clods now calved ; now half appeared</l>
     <l n="5898">The tawny lion , pawing to get free</l>
     <l n="5899">His hinder parts , then springs as broke from bonds ,</l>
     <l n="5900">And rampant shakes his brinded mane ; the ounce ,</l>
     <l n="5901">The libbard , and the tiger , as the mole</l>
     <l n="5902">Rising , the crumbled earth above them threw</l>
     <l n="5903">In hillocks : The swift stag from under ground</l>
     <l n="5904">Bore up his branching head : Scarce from his mould</l>
     <l n="5905">Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved</l>
     <l n="5906">His vastness : Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose ,</l>
     <l n="5907">As plants : Ambiguous between sea and land</l>
     <l n="5908">The river-horse , and scaly crocodile .</l>
     <l n="5909">At once came forth whatever creeps the ground ,</l>
     <l n="5910">Insect or worm : those waved their limber fans</l>
     <l n="5911">For wings , and smallest lineaments exact</l>
     <l n="5912">In all the liveries decked of summer 's pride</l>
     <l n="5913">With spots of gold and purple , azure and green :</l>
     <l n="5914">These , as a line , their long dimension drew ,</l>
     <l n="5915">Streaking the ground with sinuous trace ; not all</l>
     <l n="5916">Minims of nature ; some of serpent-kind ,</l>
     <l n="5917">Wonderous in length and corpulence , involved</l>
     <l n="5918">Their snaky folds , and added wings . First crept</l>
     <l n="5919">The parsimonious emmet , provident</l>
     <l n="5920">Of future ; in small room large heart enclosed ;</l>
     <l n="5921">Pattern of just equality perhaps</l>
     <l n="5922">Hereafter , joined in her popular tribes</l>
     <l n="5923">Of commonalty : Swarming next appeared</l>
     <l n="5924">The female bee , that feeds her husband drone</l>
     <l n="5925">Deliciously , and builds her waxen cells</l>
     <l n="5926">With honey stored : The rest are numberless ,</l>
     <l n="5927">And thou their natures knowest , and gavest them names ,</l>
     <l n="5928">Needless to thee repeated ; nor unknown</l>
     <l n="5929">The serpent , subtlest beast of all the field ,</l>
     <l n="5930">Of huge extent sometimes , with brazen eyes</l>
     <l n="5931">And hairy mane terrifick , though to thee</l>
     <l n="5932">Not noxious , but obedient at thy call .</l>
     <l n="5933">Now Heaven in all her glory shone , and rolled</l>
     <l n="5934">Her motions , as the great first Mover 's hand</l>
     <l n="5935">First wheeled their course : Earth in her rich attire</l>
     <l n="5936">Consummate lovely smiled ; air , water , earth ,</l>
     <l n="5937">By fowl , fish , beast , was flown , was swum , was walked ,</l>
     <l n="5938">Frequent ; and of the sixth day yet remained :</l>
     <l n="5939">There wanted yet the master-work , the end</l>
     <l n="5940">Of all yet done ; a creature , who , not prone</l>
     <l n="5941">And brute as other creatures , but endued</l>
     <l n="5942">With sanctity of reason , might erect</l>
     <l n="5943">His stature , and upright with front serene</l>
     <l n="5944">Govern the rest , self-knowing ; and from thence</l>
     <l n="5945">Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5946">But grateful to acknowledge whence his good</l>
     <l n="5947">Descends , thither with heart , and voice , and eyes</l>
     <l n="5948">Directed in devotion , to adore</l>
     <l n="5949">And worship God Supreme , who made him chief</l>
     <l n="5950">Of all his works : therefore the Omnipotent</l>
     <l n="5951">Eternal Father ( for where is not he</l>
     <l n="5952">Present ? ) thus to his Son audibly spake .</l>
     <l n="5953">Let us make now Man in our image , Man</l>
     <l n="5954">In our similitude , and let them rule</l>
     <l n="5955">Over the fish and fowl of sea and air ,</l>
     <l n="5956">Beast of the field , and over all the Earth ,</l>
     <l n="5957">And every creeping thing that creeps the ground .</l>
     <l n="5958">This said , he formed thee , Adam , thee , O Man ,</l>
     <l n="5959">Dust of the ground , and in thy nostrils breathed</l>
     <l n="5960">The breath of life ; in his own image he</l>
     <l n="5961">Created thee , in the image of God</l>
     <l n="5962">Express ; and thou becamest a living soul .</l>
     <l n="5963">Male he created thee ; but thy consort</l>
     <l n="5964">Female , for race ; then blessed mankind , and said ,</l>
     <l n="5965">Be fruitful , multiply , and fill the Earth ;</l>
     <l n="5966">Subdue it , and throughout dominion hold</l>
     <l n="5967">Over fish of the sea , and fowl of the air ,</l>
     <l n="5968">And every living thing that moves on the Earth .</l>
     <l n="5969">Wherever thus created , for no place</l>
     <l n="5970">Is yet distinct by name , thence , as thou knowest ,</l>
     <l n="5971">He brought thee into this delicious grove ,</l>
     <l n="5972">This garden , planted with the trees of God ,</l>
     <l n="5973">Delectable both to behold and taste ;</l>
     <l n="5974">And freely all their pleasant fruit for food</l>
     <l n="5975">Gave thee ; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields ,</l>
     <l n="5976">Variety without end ; but of the tree ,</l>
     <l n="5977">Which , tasted , works knowledge of good and evil ,</l>
     <l n="5978">Thou mayest not ; in the day thou eatest , thou diest ;</l>
     <l n="5979">Death is the penalty imposed ; beware ,</l>
     <l n="5980">And govern well thy appetite ; lest Sin</l>
     <l n="5981">Surprise thee , and her black attendant Death .</l>
     <l n="5982">Here finished he , and all that he had made</l>
     <l n="5983">Viewed , and behold all was entirely good ;</l>
     <l n="5984">So even and morn accomplished the sixth day :</l>
     <l n="5985">Yet not till the Creator from his work</l>
     <l n="5986">Desisting , though unwearied , up returned ,</l>
     <l n="5987">Up to the Heaven of Heavens , his high abode ;</l>
     <l n="5988">Thence to behold this new created world ,</l>
     <l n="5989">The addition of his empire , how it showed</l>
     <l n="5990">In prospect from his throne , how good , how fair ,</l>
     <l n="5991">Answering his great idea . Up he rode</l>
     <l n="5992">Followed with acclamation , and the sound</l>
     <l n="5993">Symphonious of ten thousand harps , that tuned</l>
     <l n="5994">Angelick harmonies : The earth , the air</l>
     <l n="5995">Resounded , ( thou rememberest , for thou heardst ,)</l>
     <l n="5996">The heavens and all the constellations rung ,</l>
     <l n="5997">The planets in their station listening stood ,</l>
     <l n="5998">While the bright pomp ascended jubilant .</l>
     <l n="5999">Open , ye everlasting gates ! they sung ,</l>
     <l n="6000">Open , ye Heavens ! your living doors ; let in</l>
     <l n="6001">The great Creator from his work returned</l>
     <l n="6002">Magnificent , his six days work , a World ;</l>
     <l n="6003">Open , and henceforth oft ; for God will deign</l>
     <l n="6004">To visit oft the dwellings of just men ,</l>
     <l n="6005">Delighted ; and with frequent intercourse</l>
     <l n="6006">Thither will send his winged messengers</l>
     <l n="6007">On errands of supernal grace . So sung</l>
     <l n="6008">The glorious train ascending : He through Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="6009">That opened wide her blazing portals , led</l>
     <l n="6010">To God 's eternal house direct the way ;</l>
     <l n="6011">A broad and ample road , whose dust is gold</l>
     <l n="6012">And pavement stars , as stars to thee appear ,</l>
     <l n="6013">Seen in the galaxy , that milky way ,</l>
     <l n="6014">Which nightly , as a circling zone , thou seest</l>
     <l n="6015">Powdered with stars . And now on Earth the seventh</l>
     <l n="6016">Evening arose in Eden , for the sun</l>
     <l n="6017">Was set , and twilight from the east came on ,</l>
     <l n="6018">Forerunning night ; when at the holy mount</l>
     <l n="6019">Of Heaven 's high-seated top , the imperial throne</l>
     <l n="6020">Of Godhead , fixed for ever firm and sure ,</l>
     <l n="6021">The Filial Power arrived , and sat him down</l>
     <l n="6022">With his great Father ; for he also went</l>
     <l n="6023">Invisible , yet staid , ( such privilege</l>
     <l n="6024">Hath Omnipresence ) and the work ordained ,</l>
     <l n="6025">Author and End of all things ; and , from work</l>
     <l n="6026">Now resting , blessed and hallowed the seventh day ,</l>
     <l n="6027">As resting on that day from all his work ,</l>
     <l n="6028">But not in silence holy kept : the harp</l>
     <l n="6029">Had work and rested not ; the solemn pipe ,</l>
     <l n="6030">And dulcimer , all organs of sweet stop ,</l>
     <l n="6031">All sounds on fret by string or golden wire ,</l>
     <l n="6032">Tempered soft tunings , intermixed with voice</l>
     <l n="6033">Choral or unison : of incense clouds ,</l>
     <l n="6034">Fuming from golden censers , hid the mount .</l>
     <l n="6035">Creation and the six days acts they sung :</l>
     <l n="6036">Great are thy works , Jehovah ! infinite</l>
     <l n="6037">Thy power ! what thought can measure thee , or tongue</l>
     <l n="6038">Relate thee ! Greater now in thy return</l>
     <l n="6039">Than from the giant Angels : Thee that day</l>
     <l n="6040">Thy thunders magnified ; but to create</l>
     <l n="6041">Is greater than created to destroy .</l>
     <l n="6042">Who can impair thee , Mighty King , or bound</l>
     <l n="6043">Thy empire ! Easily the proud attempt</l>
     <l n="6044">Of Spirits apostate , and their counsels vain ,</l>
     <l n="6045">Thou hast repelled ; while impiously they thought</l>
     <l n="6046">Thee to diminish , and from thee withdraw</l>
     <l n="6047">The number of thy worshippers . Who seeks</l>
     <l n="6048">To lessen thee , against his purpose serves</l>
     <l n="6049">To manifest the more thy might : his evil</l>
     <l n="6050">Thou usest , and from thence createst more good .</l>
     <l n="6051">Witness this new-made world , another Heaven</l>
     <l n="6052">From Heaven-gate not far , founded in view</l>
     <l n="6053">On the clear hyaline , the glassy sea ;</l>
     <l n="6054">Of amplitude almost immense , with stars</l>
     <l n="6055">Numerous , and every star perhaps a world</l>
     <l n="6056">Of destined habitation ; but thou knowest</l>
     <l n="6057">Their seasons : among these the seat of Men ,</l>
     <l n="6058">Earth , with her nether ocean circumfused ,</l>
     <l n="6059">Their pleasant dwelling-place . Thrice happy Men ,</l>
     <l n="6060">And sons of Men , whom God hath thus advanced !</l>
     <l n="6061">Created in his image , there to dwell</l>
     <l n="6062">And worship him ; and in reward to rule</l>
     <l n="6063">Over his works , on earth , in sea , or air ,</l>
     <l n="6064">And multiply a race of worshippers</l>
     <l n="6065">Holy and just : Thrice happy , if they know</l>
     <l n="6066">Their happiness , and persevere upright !</l>
     <l n="6067">So sung they , and the empyrean rung</l>
     <l n="6068">With halleluiahs : Thus was sabbath kept .</l>
     <l n="6069">And thy request think now fulfilled , that asked</l>
     <l n="6070">How first this world and face of things began ,</l>
     <l n="6071">And what before thy memory was done</l>
     <l n="6072">From the beginning ; that posterity ,</l>
     <l n="6073">Informed by thee , might know : If else thou seekest</l>
     <l n="6074">Aught , not surpassing human measure , say .</l>

     <l n="6076">The Angel ended , and in Adam 's ear</l>
     <l n="6077">So charming left his voice , that he a while</l>
     <l n="6078">Thought him still speaking , still stood fixed to hear ;</l>
     <l n="6079">Then , as new waked , thus gratefully replied .</l>

     <l n="6082">Historian , who thus largely hast allayed</l>

     <l n="6084">This friendly condescension to relate</l>
     <l n="6085">Things , else by me unsearchable ; now heard</l>

     <l n="6089">Which only thy solution can resolve .</l>
     <l n="6090">When I behold this goodly frame , this world ,</l>
     <l n="6091">Of Heaven and Earth consisting ; and compute</l>
     <l n="6092">Their magnitudes ; this Earth , a spot , a grain ,</l>
     <l n="6093">An atom , with the firmament compared</l>
     <l n="6094">And all her numbered stars , that seem to roll</l>
     <l n="6095">Spaces incomprehensible , ( for such</l>
     <l n="6096">Their distance argues , and their swift return</l>
     <l n="6097">Diurnal ,) merely to officiate light</l>
     <l n="6098">Round this opacous Earth , this punctual spot ,</l>
     <l n="6099">One day and night ; in all her vast survey</l>
     <l n="6100">Useless besides ; reasoning I oft admire ,</l>
     <l n="6101">How Nature wise and frugal could commit</l>
     <l n="6102">Such disproportions , with superfluous hand</l>
     <l n="6103">So many nobler bodies to create ,</l>
     <l n="6104">Greater so manifold , to this one use ,</l>
     <l n="6105">For aught appears , and on their orbs impose</l>
     <l n="6106">Such restless revolution day by day</l>
     <l n="6107">Repeated ; while the sedentary Earth ,</l>
     <l n="6108">That better might with far less compass move ,</l>
     <l n="6109">Served by more noble than herself , attains</l>
     <l n="6110">Her end without least motion , and receives ,</l>
     <l n="6111">As tribute , such a sumless journey brought</l>
     <l n="6112">Of incorporeal speed , her warmth and light ;</l>
     <l n="6113">Speed , to describe whose swiftness number fails .</l>
     <l n="6114">So spake our sire , and by his countenance seemed</l>
     <l n="6115">Entering on studious thoughts abstruse ; which Eve</l>
     <l n="6116">Perceiving , where she sat retired in sight ,</l>
     <l n="6117">With lowliness majestick from her seat ,</l>
     <l n="6118">And grace that won who saw to wish her stay ,</l>
     <l n="6119">Rose , and went forth among her fruits and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="6120">To visit how they prospered , bud and bloom ,</l>
     <l n="6121">Her nursery ; they at her coming sprung ,</l>
     <l n="6122">And , touched by her fair tendance , gladlier grew .</l>
     <l n="6123">Yet went she not , as not with such discourse</l>
     <l n="6124">Delighted , or not capable her ear</l>
     <l n="6125">Of what was high : such pleasure she reserved ,</l>
     <l n="6126">Adam relating , she sole auditress ;</l>

     <l n="6130">Grateful digressions , and solve high dispute</l>
     <l n="6131">With conjugal caresses : from his lip</l>
     <l n="6132">Not words alone pleased her . O ! when meet now</l>
     <l n="6133">Such pairs , in love and mutual honour joined ?</l>
     <l n="6134">With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went ,</l>
     <l n="6135">Not unattended ; for on her , as Queen ,</l>
     <l n="6136">A pomp of winning Graces waited still ,</l>
     <l n="6137">And from about her shot darts of desire</l>
     <l n="6138">Into all eyes , to wish her still in sight .</l>
     <l n="6139">And Raphael now , to Adam 's doubt proposed ,</l>

     <l n="6141">To ask or search , I blame thee not ; for Heaven</l>

     <l n="6147">From Man or Angel the great Architect</l>
     <l n="6148">Did wisely to conceal , and not divulge</l>
     <l n="6149">His secrets to be scanned by them who ought</l>
     <l n="6150">Rather admire ; or , if they list to try</l>
     <l n="6151">Conjecture , he his fabrick of the Heavens</l>
     <l n="6152">Hath left to their disputes , perhaps to move</l>
     <l n="6153">His laughter at their quaint opinions wide</l>
     <l n="6154">Hereafter ; when they come to model Heaven</l>
     <l n="6155">And calculate the stars , how they will wield</l>
     <l n="6156">The mighty frame ; how build , unbuild , contrive</l>
     <l n="6157">To save appearances ; how gird the sphere</l>
     <l n="6158">With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er ,</l>
     <l n="6159">Cycle and epicycle , orb in orb :</l>
     <l n="6160">Already by thy reasoning this I guess ,</l>
     <l n="6161">Who art to lead thy offspring , and supposest</l>
     <l n="6162">That bodies bright and greater should not serve</l>
     <l n="6163">The less not bright , nor Heaven such journeys run ,</l>
     <l n="6164">Earth sitting still , when she alone receives</l>
     <l n="6165">The benefit : Consider first , that great</l>
     <l n="6166">Or bright infers not excellence : the Earth</l>
     <l n="6167">Though , in comparison of Heaven , so small ,</l>
     <l n="6168">Nor glistering , may of solid good contain</l>
     <l n="6169">More plenty than the sun that barren shines ;</l>
     <l n="6170">Whose virtue on itself works no effect ,</l>
     <l n="6171">But in the fruitful Earth ; there first received ,</l>
     <l n="6172">His beams , unactive else , their vigour find .</l>
     <l n="6173">Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries</l>
     <l n="6174">Officious ; but to thee , Earth 's habitant .</l>
     <l n="6175">And for the Heaven 's wide circuit , let it speak</l>
     <l n="6176">The Maker 's high magnificence , who built</l>
     <l n="6177">So spacious , and his line stretched out so far ;</l>
     <l n="6178">That Man may know he dwells not in his own ;</l>
     <l n="6179">An edifice too large for him to fill ,</l>
     <l n="6180">Lodged in a small partition ; and the rest</l>
     <l n="6181">Ordained for uses to his Lord best known .</l>
     <l n="6182">The swiftness of those circles attribute ,</l>
     <l n="6183">Though numberless , to his Omnipotence ,</l>
     <l n="6184">That to corporeal substances could add</l>
     <l n="6185">Speed almost spiritual : Me thou thinkest not slow ,</l>
     <l n="6186">Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven</l>
     <l n="6187">Where God resides , and ere mid-day arrived</l>
     <l n="6188">In Eden ; distance inexpressible</l>
     <l n="6189">By numbers that have name . But this I urge ,</l>
     <l n="6190">Admitting motion in the Heavens , to show</l>
     <l n="6191">Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved ;</l>
     <l n="6192">Not that I so affirm , though so it seem</l>
     <l n="6193">To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth .</l>
     <l n="6194">God , to remove his ways from human sense ,</l>
     <l n="6195">Placed Heaven from Earth so far , that earthly sight ,</l>
     <l n="6196">If it presume , might err in things too high ,</l>
     <l n="6197">And no advantage gain . What if the sun</l>
     <l n="6198">Be center to the world ; and other stars ,</l>
     <l n="6199">By his attractive virtue and their own</l>
     <l n="6200">Incited , dance about him various rounds ?</l>
     <l n="6201">Their wandering course now high , now low , then hid ,</l>
     <l n="6202">Progressive , retrograde , or standing still ,</l>
     <l n="6203">In six thou seest ; and what if seventh to these</l>
     <l n="6204">The planet earth , so stedfast though she seem ,</l>
     <l n="6205">Insensibly three different motions move ?</l>
     <l n="6206">Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe ,</l>
     <l n="6207">Moved contrary with thwart obliquities ;</l>
     <l n="6208">Or save the sun his labour , and that swift</l>
     <l n="6209">Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed ,</l>
     <l n="6210">Invisible else above all stars , the wheel</l>
     <l n="6211">Of day and night ; which needs not thy belief ,</l>
     <l n="6212">If earth , industrious of herself , fetch day</l>
     <l n="6213">Travelling east , and with her part averse</l>
     <l n="6214">From the sun 's beam meet night , her other part</l>
     <l n="6215">Still luminous by his ray . What if that light ,</l>
     <l n="6216">Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air ,</l>
     <l n="6217">To the terrestrial moon be as a star ,</l>
     <l n="6218">Enlightening her by day , as she by night</l>
     <l n="6219">This earth ? reciprocal , if land be there ,</l>
     <l n="6220">Fields and inhabitants : Her spots thou seest</l>
     <l n="6221">As clouds , and clouds may rain , and rain produce</l>
     <l n="6222">Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat</l>
     <l n="6223">Allotted there ; and other suns perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="6224">With their attendant moons , thou wilt descry ,</l>
     <l n="6225">Communicating male and female light ;</l>
     <l n="6226">Which two great sexes animate the world ,</l>
     <l n="6227">Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live .</l>
     <l n="6228">For such vast room in Nature unpossessed</l>
     <l n="6229">By living soul , desart and desolate ,</l>
     <l n="6230">Only to shine , yet scarce to contribute</l>
     <l n="6231">Each orb a glimpse of light , conveyed so far</l>
     <l n="6232">Down to this habitable , which returns</l>
     <l n="6233">Light back to them , is obvious to dispute .</l>
     <l n="6234">But whether thus these things , or whether not ;</l>
     <l n="6235">But whether the sun , predominant in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="6236">Rise on the earth ; or earth rise on the sun ;</l>
     <l n="6237">He from the east his flaming road begin ;</l>
     <l n="6238">Or she from west her silent course advance ,</l>
     <l n="6239">With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps</l>
     <l n="6240">On her soft axle , while she paces even ,</l>
     <l n="6241">And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along ;</l>
     <l n="6242">Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid ;</l>
     <l n="6243">Leave them to God above ; him serve , and fear !</l>
     <l n="6244">Of other creatures , as him pleases best ,</l>
     <l n="6245">Wherever placed , let him dispose ; joy thou</l>
     <l n="6246">In what he gives to thee , this Paradise</l>
     <l n="6247">And thy fair Eve ; Heaven is for thee too high</l>
     <l n="6248">To know what passes there ; be lowly wise :</l>
     <l n="6249">Think only what concerns thee , and thy being ;</l>
     <l n="6250">Dream not of other worlds , what creatures there</l>
     <l n="6251">Live , in what state , condition , or degree ;</l>
     <l n="6252">Contented that thus far hath been revealed</l>
     <l n="6253">Not of Earth only , but of highest Heaven .</l>
     <l n="6254">To whom thus Adam , cleared of doubt , replied .</l>
     <l n="6255">How fully hast thou satisfied me , pure</l>
     <l n="6256">Intelligence of Heaven , Angel serene !</l>
     <l n="6257">And , freed from intricacies , taught to live</l>
     <l n="6258">The easiest way ; nor with perplexing thoughts</l>
     <l n="6259">To interrupt the sweet of life , from which</l>
     <l n="6260">God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares ,</l>
     <l n="6261">And not molest us ; unless we ourselves</l>
     <l n="6262">Seek them with wandering thoughts , and notions vain .</l>
     <l n="6263">But apt the mind or fancy is to rove</l>
     <l n="6264">Unchecked , and of her roving is no end ;</l>
     <l n="6265">Till warned , or by experience taught , she learn ,</l>
     <l n="6266">That , not to know at large of things remote</l>
     <l n="6267">From use , obscure and subtle ; but , to know</l>
     <l n="6268">That which before us lies in daily life ,</l>
     <l n="6269">Is the prime wisdom : What is more , is fume ,</l>
     <l n="6270">Or emptiness , or fond impertinence :</l>
     <l n="6271">And renders us , in things that most concern ,</l>
     <l n="6272">Unpractised , unprepared , and still to seek .</l>
     <l n="6273">Therefore from this high pitch let us descend</l>
     <l n="6274">A lower flight , and speak of things at hand</l>
     <l n="6275">Useful ; whence , haply , mention may arise</l>
     <l n="6276">Of something not unseasonable to ask ,</l>
     <l n="6277">By sufferance , and thy wonted favour , deigned .</l>
     <l n="6278">Thee I have heard relating what was done</l>
     <l n="6279">Ere my remembrance : now , hear me relate</l>
     <l n="6280">My story , which perhaps thou hast not heard ;</l>
     <l n="6281">And day is not yet spent ; till then thou seest</l>
     <l n="6282">How subtly to detain thee I devise ;</l>
     <l n="6283">Inviting thee to hear while I relate ;</l>
     <l n="6284">Fond ! were it not in hope of thy reply :</l>
     <l n="6285">For , while I sit with thee , I seem in Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="6286">And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear</l>
     <l n="6287">Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst</l>
     <l n="6288">And hunger both , from labour , at the hour</l>
     <l n="6289">Of sweet repast ; they satiate , and soon fill ,</l>
     <l n="6290">Though pleasant ; but thy words , with grace divine</l>
     <l n="6291">Imbued , bring to their sweetness no satiety .</l>
     <l n="6292">To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek .</l>
     <l n="6293">Nor are thy lips ungraceful , Sire of men ,</l>
     <l n="6294">Nor tongue ineloquent ; for God on thee</l>
     <l n="6295">Abundantly his gifts hath also poured</l>
     <l n="6296">Inward and outward both , his image fair :</l>
     <l n="6297">Speaking , or mute , all comeliness and grace</l>
     <l n="6298">Attends thee ; and each word , each motion , forms ;</l>
     <l n="6299">Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth</l>
     <l n="6300">Than of our fellow-servant , and inquire</l>
     <l n="6301">Gladly into the ways of God with Man :</l>
     <l n="6302">For God , we see , hath honoured thee , and set</l>
     <l n="6303">On Man his equal love : Say therefore on ;</l>
     <l n="6304">For I that day was absent , as befel ,</l>
     <l n="6305">Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure ,</l>
     <l n="6306">Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell ;</l>
     <l n="6307">Squared in full legion ( such command we had )</l>
     <l n="6308">To see that none thence issued forth a spy ,</l>
     <l n="6309">Or enemy , while God was in his work ;</l>
     <l n="6310">Lest he , incensed at such eruption bold ,</l>
     <l n="6311">Destruction with creation might have mixed .</l>
     <l n="6312">Not that they durst without his leave attempt ;</l>
     <l n="6313">But us he sends upon his high behests</l>
     <l n="6314">For state , as Sovran King ; and to inure</l>
     <l n="6315">Our prompt obedience . Fast we found , fast shut ,</l>
     <l n="6316">The dismal gates , and barricadoed strong ;</l>
     <l n="6317">But long ere our approaching heard within</l>
     <l n="6318">Noise , other than the sound of dance or song ,</l>
     <l n="6319">Torment , and loud lament , and furious rage .</l>
     <l n="6320">Glad we returned up to the coasts of light</l>
     <l n="6321">Ere sabbath-evening : so we had in charge .</l>
     <l n="6322">But thy relation now ; for I attend ,</l>
     <l n="6323">Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine .</l>
     <l n="6324">So spake the Godlike Power , and thus our Sire .</l>
     <l n="6325">For Man to tell how human life began</l>
     <l n="6326">Is hard ; for who himself beginning knew</l>
     <l n="6327">Desire with thee still longer to converse</l>
     <l n="6328">Induced me . As new waked from soundest sleep ,</l>
     <l n="6329">Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid ,</l>
     <l n="6330">In balmy sweat ; which with his beams the sun</l>
     <l n="6331">Soon dried , and on the reeking moisture fed .</l>
     <l n="6332">Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned ,</l>
     <l n="6333">And gazed a while the ample sky ; till , raised</l>
     <l n="6334">By quick instinctive motion , up I sprung ,</l>
     <l n="6335">As thitherward endeavouring , and upright</l>
     <l n="6336">Stood on my feet : about me round I saw</l>
     <l n="6337">Hill , dale , and shady woods , and sunny plains ,</l>
     <l n="6338">And liquid lapse of murmuring streams ; by these ,</l>
     <l n="6339">Creatures that lived and moved , and walked , or flew ;</l>
     <l n="6340">Birds on the branches warbling ; all things smiled ;</l>
     <l n="6341">With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed .</l>
     <l n="6342">Myself I then perused , and limb by limb</l>
     <l n="6343">Surveyed , and sometimes went , and sometimes ran</l>
     <l n="6344">With supple joints , as lively vigour led :</l>
     <l n="6345">But who I was , or where , or from what cause ,</l>
     <l n="6346">Knew not ; to speak I tried , and forthwith spake ;</l>
     <l n="6347">My tongue obeyed , and readily could name</l>
     <l n="6348">Whate'er I saw . Thou Sun , said I , fair light ,</l>
     <l n="6349">And thou enlightened Earth , so fresh and gay ,</l>
     <l n="6350">Ye Hills , and Dales , ye Rivers , Woods , and Plains ,</l>
     <l n="6351">And ye that live and move , fair Creatures , tell ,</l>
     <l n="6352">Tell , if ye saw , how I came thus , how here ?—</l>
     <l n="6353">Not of myself ;— by some great Maker then ,</l>
     <l n="6354">In goodness and in power pre-eminent :</l>
     <l n="6355">Tell me , how may I know him , how adore ,</l>
     <l n="6356">From whom I have that thus I move and live ,</l>
     <l n="6357">And feel that I am happier than I know .—</l>
     <l n="6358">While thus I called , and strayed I knew not whither ,</l>
     <l n="6359">From where I first drew air , and first beheld</l>
     <l n="6360">This happy light ; when , answer none returned ,</l>
     <l n="6361">On a green shady bank , profuse of flowers ,</l>
     <l n="6362">Pensive I sat me down : There gentle sleep</l>
     <l n="6363">First found me , and with soft oppression seised</l>
     <l n="6364">My droused sense , untroubled , though I thought</l>
     <l n="6365">I then was passing to my former state</l>
     <l n="6366">Insensible , and forthwith to dissolve :</l>
     <l n="6367">When suddenly stood at my head a dream ,</l>
     <l n="6368">Whose inward apparition gently moved</l>
     <l n="6369">My fancy to believe I yet had being ,</l>
     <l n="6370">And lived : One came , methought , of shape divine ,</l>
     <l n="6371">And said , “ Thy mansion wants thee , Adam ; rise ,</l>
     <l n="6372">First Man , of men innumerable ordained</l>
     <l n="6373">First Father ! called by thee , I come thy guide</l>
     <l n="6374">To the garden of bliss , thy seat prepared . ”</l>
     <l n="6375">So saying , by the hand he took me raised ,</l>
     <l n="6376">And over fields and waters , as in air</l>
     <l n="6377">Smooth-sliding without step , last led me up</l>
     <l n="6378">A woody mountain ; whose high top was plain ,</l>
     <l n="6379">A circuit wide , enclosed , with goodliest trees</l>
     <l n="6380">Planted , with walks , and bowers ; that what I saw</l>
     <l n="6381">Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed . Each tree ,</l>
     <l n="6382">Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye</l>
     <l n="6383">Tempting , stirred in me sudden appetite</l>
     <l n="6384">To pluck and eat ; whereat I waked , and found</l>
     <l n="6385">Before mine eyes all real , as the dream</l>
     <l n="6386">Had lively shadowed : Here had new begun</l>
     <l n="6387">My wandering , had not he , who was my guide</l>
     <l n="6388">Up hither , from among the trees appeared ,</l>
     <l n="6389">Presence Divine . Rejoicing , but with awe ,</l>
     <l n="6390">In adoration at his feet I fell</l>
     <l n="6391">Submiss : He reared me , and “ Whom thou soughtest I am , ”</l>
     <l n="6392">Said mildly , “ Author of all this thou seest</l>
     <l n="6393">Above , or round about thee , or beneath .</l>
     <l n="6394">This Paradise I give thee , count it thine</l>
     <l n="6395">To till and keep , and of the fruit to eat :</l>
     <l n="6396">Of every tree that in the garden grows</l>
     <l n="6397">Eat freely with glad heart ; fear here no dearth :</l>
     <l n="6398">But of the tree whose operation brings</l>
     <l n="6399">Knowledge of good and ill , which I have set</l>
     <l n="6400">The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith ,</l>
     <l n="6401">Amid the garden by the tree of life ,</l>
     <l n="6402">Remember what I warn thee , shun to taste ,</l>
     <l n="6403">And shun the bitter consequence : for know ,</l>
     <l n="6404">The day thou eatest thereof , my sole command</l>
     <l n="6405">Transgressed , inevitably thou shalt die ,</l>
     <l n="6406">From that day mortal ; and this happy state</l>
     <l n="6407">Shalt lose , expelled from hence into a world</l>
     <l n="6408">Of woe and sorrow . ” Sternly he pronounced</l>
     <l n="6409">The rigid interdiction , which resounds</l>
     <l n="6410">Yet dreadful in mine ear , though in my choice</l>
     <l n="6411">Not to incur ; but soon his clear aspect</l>
     <l n="6412">Returned , and gracious purpose thus renewed .</l>
     <l n="6413">“ Not only these fair bounds , but all the Earth</l>
     <l n="6414">To thee and to thy race I give ; as lords</l>
     <l n="6415">Possess it , and all things that therein live ,</l>
     <l n="6416">Or live in sea , or air ; beast , fish , and fowl .</l>
     <l n="6417">In sign whereof , each bird and beast behold</l>
     <l n="6418">After their kinds ; I bring them to receive</l>
     <l n="6419">From thee their names , and pay thee fealty</l>
     <l n="6420">With low subjection ; understand the same</l>
     <l n="6421">Of fish within their watery residence ,</l>
     <l n="6422">Not hither summoned , since they cannot change</l>
     <l n="6423">Their element , to draw the thinner air . ”</l>
     <l n="6424">As thus he spake , each bird and beast behold</l>
     <l n="6425">Approaching two and two ; these cowering low</l>
     <l n="6426">With blandishment ; each bird stooped on his wing .</l>
     <l n="6427">I named them , as they passed , and understood</l>
     <l n="6428">Their nature , with such knowledge God endued</l>
     <l n="6429">My sudden apprehension : But in these</l>
     <l n="6430">I found not what methought I wanted still ;</l>
     <l n="6431">And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed .</l>
     <l n="6432">O , by what name , for thou above all these ,</l>
     <l n="6433">Above mankind , or aught than mankind higher ,</l>
     <l n="6434">Surpassest far my naming ; how may I</l>
     <l n="6435">Adore thee , Author of this universe ,</l>
     <l n="6436">And all this good to man ? for whose well being</l>
     <l n="6437">So amply , and with hands so liberal ,</l>
     <l n="6438">Thou hast provided all things : But with me</l>
     <l n="6439">I see not who partakes . In solitude</l>
     <l n="6440">What happiness , who can enjoy alone ,</l>
     <l n="6441">Or , all enjoying , what contentment find ?</l>
     <l n="6442">Thus I presumptuous ; and the Vision bright ,</l>
     <l n="6443">As with a smile more brightened , thus replied .</l>
     <l n="6444">What callest thou solitude ? Is not the Earth</l>
     <l n="6445">With various living creatures , and the air</l>
     <l n="6446">Replenished , and all these at thy command</l>
     <l n="6447">To come and play before thee ? Knowest thou not</l>
     <l n="6448">Their language and their ways ? They also know ,</l>
     <l n="6449">And reason not contemptibly : With these</l>
     <l n="6450">Find pastime , and bear rule ; thy realm is large .</l>
     <l n="6451">So spake the Universal Lord , and seemed</l>
     <l n="6452">So ordering : I , with leave of speech implored ,</l>
     <l n="6453">And humble deprecation , thus replied .</l>
     <l n="6454">Let not my words offend thee , Heavenly Power ;</l>
     <l n="6455">My Maker , be propitious while I speak .</l>
     <l n="6456">Hast thou not made me here thy substitute ,</l>
     <l n="6457">And these inferiour far beneath me set ?</l>
     <l n="6458">Among unequals what society</l>
     <l n="6459">Can sort , what harmony , or true delight ?</l>
     <l n="6460">Which must be mutual , in proportion due</l>
     <l n="6461">Given and received ; but , in disparity</l>
     <l n="6462">The one intense , the other still remiss ,</l>
     <l n="6463">Cannot well suit with either , but soon prove</l>
     <l n="6464">Tedious alike : Of fellowship I speak</l>
     <l n="6465">Such as I seek , fit to participate</l>
     <l n="6466">All rational delight : wherein the brute</l>
     <l n="6467">Cannot be human consort : They rejoice</l>
     <l n="6468">Each with their kind , lion with lioness ;</l>
     <l n="6469">So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined :</l>
     <l n="6470">Much less can bird with beast , or fish with fowl</l>
     <l n="6471">So well converse , nor with the ox the ape ;</l>
     <l n="6472">Worse then can man with beast , and least of all .</l>
     <l n="6473">Whereto the Almighty answered , not displeased .</l>
     <l n="6474">A nice and subtle happiness , I see ,</l>
     <l n="6475">Thou to thyself proposest , in the choice</l>
     <l n="6476">Of thy associates , Adam ! and wilt taste</l>
     <l n="6477">No pleasure , though in pleasure , solitary .</l>
     <l n="6478">What thinkest thou then of me , and this my state ?</l>
     <l n="6479">Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed</l>
     <l n="6480">Of happiness , or not ? who am alone</l>
     <l n="6481">From all eternity ; for none I know</l>
     <l n="6482">Second to me or like , equal much less .</l>
     <l n="6483">How have I then with whom to hold converse ,</l>
     <l n="6484">Save with the creatures which I made , and those</l>
     <l n="6485">To me inferiour , infinite descents</l>
     <l n="6486">Beneath what other creatures are to thee ?</l>
     <l n="6487">He ceased ; I lowly answered . To attain</l>
     <l n="6488">The highth and depth of thy eternal ways</l>
     <l n="6489">All human thoughts come short , Supreme of things !</l>
     <l n="6490">Thou in thyself art perfect , and in thee</l>
     <l n="6491">Is no deficience found : Not so is Man ,</l>
     <l n="6492">But in degree ; the cause of his desire</l>
     <l n="6493">By conversation with his like to help</l>
     <l n="6494">Or solace his defects . No need that thou</l>
     <l n="6495">Shouldst propagate , already Infinite ;</l>
     <l n="6496">And through all numbers absolute , though One :</l>
     <l n="6497">But Man by number is to manifest</l>
     <l n="6498">His single imperfection , and beget</l>
     <l n="6499">Like of his like , his image multiplied ,</l>
     <l n="6500">In unity defective ; which requires</l>
     <l n="6501">Collateral love , and dearest amity .</l>
     <l n="6502">Thou in thy secresy although alone ,</l>
     <l n="6503">Best with thyself accompanied , seekest not</l>
     <l n="6504">Social communication ; yet , so pleased ,</l>
     <l n="6505">Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt</l>
     <l n="6506">Of union or communion , deified :</l>
     <l n="6507">I , by conversing , cannot these erect</l>
     <l n="6508">From prone ; nor in their ways complacence find .</l>
     <l n="6509">Thus I emboldened spake , and freedom used</l>
     <l n="6510">Permissive , and acceptance found ; which gained</l>
     <l n="6511">This answer from the gracious Voice Divine .</l>
     <l n="6512">Thus far to try thee , Adam , I was pleased ;</l>
     <l n="6513">And find thee knowing , not of beasts alone ,</l>
     <l n="6514">Which thou hast rightly named , but of thyself ;</l>
     <l n="6515">Expressing well the spirit within thee free ,</l>
     <l n="6516">My image , not imparted to the brute ;</l>
     <l n="6517">Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee</l>
     <l n="6518">Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike ;</l>
     <l n="6519">And be so minded still : I , ere thou spakest ,</l>
     <l n="6520">Knew it not good for Man to be alone ;</l>
     <l n="6521">And no such company as then thou sawest</l>
     <l n="6522">Intended thee ; for trial only brought ,</l>
     <l n="6523">To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet :</l>
     <l n="6524">What next I bring shall please thee , be assured ,</l>
     <l n="6525">Thy likeness , thy fit help , thy other self ,</l>
     <l n="6526">Thy wish exactly to thy heart 's desire .</l>
     <l n="6527">He ended , or I heard no more ; for now</l>
     <l n="6528">My earthly by his heavenly overpowered ,</l>
     <l n="6529">Which it had long stood under , strained to the highth</l>
     <l n="6530">In that celestial colloquy sublime ,</l>
     <l n="6531">As with an object that excels the sense</l>
     <l n="6532">Dazzled and spent , sunk down ; and sought repair</l>
     <l n="6533">Of sleep , which instantly fell on me , called</l>
     <l n="6534">By Nature as in aid , and closed mine eyes .</l>
     <l n="6535">Mine eyes he closed , but open left the cell</l>
     <l n="6536">Of fancy , my internal sight ; by which ,</l>
     <l n="6537">Abstract as in a trance , methought I saw ,</l>
     <l n="6538">Though sleeping , where I lay , and saw the shape</l>
     <l n="6539">Still glorious before whom awake I stood :</l>
     <l n="6540">Who stooping opened my left side , and took</l>
     <l n="6541">From thence a rib , with cordial spirits warm ,</l>
     <l n="6542">And life-blood streaming fresh ; wide was the wound ,</l>
     <l n="6543">But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed :</l>
     <l n="6544">The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands ;</l>
     <l n="6545">Under his forming hands a creature grew ,</l>
     <l n="6546">Man-like , but different sex ; so lovely fair ,</l>
     <l n="6547">That what seemed fair in all the world , seemed now</l>
     <l n="6548">Mean , or in her summed up , in her contained</l>
     <l n="6549">And in her looks ; which from that time infused</l>
     <l n="6550">Sweetness into my heart , unfelt before ,</l>
     <l n="6551">And into all things from her air inspired</l>
     <l n="6552">The spirit of love and amorous delight .</l>
     <l n="6553">She disappeared , and left me dark ; I waked</l>
     <l n="6554">To find her , or for ever to deplore</l>
     <l n="6555">Her loss , and other pleasures all abjure :</l>
     <l n="6556">When out of hope , behold her , not far off ,</l>
     <l n="6557">Such as I saw her in my dream , adorned</l>
     <l n="6558">With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow</l>
     <l n="6559">To make her amiable : On she came ,</l>
     <l n="6560">Led by her heavenly Maker , though unseen ,</l>
     <l n="6561">And guided by his voice ; nor uninformed</l>
     <l n="6562">Of nuptial sanctity , and marriage rites :</l>
     <l n="6563">Grace was in all her steps , Heaven in her eye ,</l>
     <l n="6564">In every gesture dignity and love .</l>
     <l n="6565">I , overjoyed , could not forbear aloud .</l>
     <l n="6566">This turn hath made amends ; thou hast fulfilled</l>
     <l n="6567">Thy words , Creator bounteous and benign ,</l>
     <l n="6568">Giver of all things fair ! but fairest this</l>
     <l n="6569">Of all thy gifts ! nor enviest . I now see</l>
     <l n="6570">Bone of my bone , flesh of my flesh , myself</l>
     <l n="6571">Before me : Woman is her name ; of Man</l>
     <l n="6572">Extracted : for this cause he shall forego</l>
     <l n="6573">Father and mother , and to his wife adhere ;</l>
     <l n="6574">And they shall be one flesh , one heart , one soul .</l>
     <l n="6575">She heard me thus ; and though divinely brought ,</l>
     <l n="6576">Yet innocence , and virgin modesty ,</l>
     <l n="6577">Her virtue , and the conscience of her worth ,</l>
     <l n="6578">That would be wooed , and not unsought be won ,</l>
     <l n="6579">Not obvious , not obtrusive , but , retired ,</l>
     <l n="6580">The more desirable ; or , to say all ,</l>
     <l n="6581">Nature herself , though pure of sinful thought ,</l>
     <l n="6582">Wrought in her so , that , seeing me , she turned :</l>
     <l n="6583">I followed her ; she what was honour knew ,</l>
     <l n="6584">And with obsequious majesty approved</l>
     <l n="6585">My pleaded reason . To the nuptial bower</l>
     <l n="6586">I led her blushing like the morn : All Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="6587">And happy constellations , on that hour</l>
     <l n="6588">Shed their selectest influence ; the Earth</l>
     <l n="6589">Gave sign of gratulation , and each hill ;</l>
     <l n="6590">Joyous the birds ; fresh gales and gentle airs</l>
     <l n="6591">Whispered it to the woods , and from their wings</l>
     <l n="6592">Flung rose , flung odours from the spicy shrub ,</l>
     <l n="6593">Disporting , till the amorous bird of night</l>
     <l n="6594">Sung spousal , and bid haste the evening-star</l>
     <l n="6595">On his hill top , to light the bridal lamp .</l>
     <l n="6596">Thus have I told thee all my state , and brought</l>
     <l n="6597">My story to the sum of earthly bliss ,</l>
     <l n="6598">Which I enjoy ; and must confess to find</l>
     <l n="6599">In all things else delight indeed , but such</l>
     <l n="6600">As , used or not , works in the mind no change ,</l>
     <l n="6601">Nor vehement desire ; these delicacies</l>
     <l n="6602">I mean of taste , sight , smell , herbs , fruits , and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="6603">Walks , and the melody of birds : but here</l>
     <l n="6604">Far otherwise , transported I behold ,</l>
     <l n="6605">Transported touch ; here passion first I felt ,</l>
     <l n="6606">Commotion strange ! in all enjoyments else</l>
     <l n="6607">Superiour and unmoved ; here only weak</l>
     <l n="6608">Against the charm of Beauty 's powerful glance .</l>
     <l n="6609">Or Nature failed in me , and left some part</l>
     <l n="6610">Not proof enough such object to sustain ;</l>
     <l n="6611">Or , from my side subducting , took perhaps</l>
     <l n="6612">More than enough ; at least on her bestowed</l>
     <l n="6613">Too much of ornament , in outward show</l>
     <l n="6614">Elaborate , of inward less exact .</l>
     <l n="6615">For well I understand in the prime end</l>
     <l n="6616">Of Nature her the inferiour , in the mind</l>
     <l n="6617">And inward faculties , which most excel ;</l>
     <l n="6618">In outward also her resembling less</l>
     <l n="6619">His image who made both , and less expressing</l>
     <l n="6620">The character of that dominion given</l>
     <l n="6621">O'er other creatures : Yet when I approach</l>
     <l n="6622">Her loveliness , so absolute she seems</l>
     <l n="6623">And in herself complete , so well to know</l>
     <l n="6624">Her own , that what she wills to do or say ,</l>
     <l n="6625">Seems wisest , virtuousest , discreetest , best :</l>
     <l n="6626">All higher knowledge in her presence falls</l>
     <l n="6627">Degraded ; Wisdom in discourse with her</l>
     <l n="6628">Loses discountenanced , and like Folly shows ;</l>
     <l n="6629">Authority and Reason on her wait ,</l>
     <l n="6630">As one intended first , not after made</l>
     <l n="6631">Occasionally ; and , to consummate all ,</l>
     <l n="6632">Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat</l>
     <l n="6633">Build in her loveliest , and create an awe</l>
     <l n="6634">About her , as a guard angelick placed .</l>
     <l n="6635">To whom the Angel with contracted brow .</l>
     <l n="6636">Accuse not Nature , she hath done her part ;</l>
     <l n="6637">Do thou but thine ; and be not diffident</l>
     <l n="6638">Of Wisdom ; she deserts thee not , if thou</l>
     <l n="6639">Dismiss not her , when most thou needest her nigh ,</l>
     <l n="6640">By attributing overmuch to things</l>
     <l n="6641">Less excellent , as thou thyself perceivest .</l>
     <l n="6642">For , what admirest thou , what transports thee so ,</l>
     <l n="6643">An outside ? fair , no doubt , and worthy well</l>
     <l n="6644">Thy cherishing , thy honouring , and thy love ;</l>
     <l n="6645">Not thy subjection : Weigh with her thyself ;</l>
     <l n="6646">Then value : Oft-times nothing profits more</l>
     <l n="6647">Than self-esteem , grounded on just and right</l>
     <l n="6648">Well managed ; of that skill the more thou knowest ,</l>
     <l n="6649">The more she will acknowledge thee her head ,</l>
     <l n="6650">And to realities yield all her shows :</l>
     <l n="6651">Made so adorn for thy delight the more ,</l>
     <l n="6652">So awful , that with honour thou mayest love</l>
     <l n="6653">Thy mate , who sees when thou art seen least wise .</l>
     <l n="6654">But if the sense of touch , whereby mankind</l>
     <l n="6655">Is propagated , seem such dear delight</l>
     <l n="6656">Beyond all other ; think the same vouchsafed</l>
     <l n="6657">To cattle and each beast ; which would not be</l>
     <l n="6658">To them made common and divulged , if aught</l>
     <l n="6659">Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue</l>
     <l n="6660">The soul of man , or passion in him move .</l>
     <l n="6661">What higher in her society thou findest</l>
     <l n="6662">Attractive , human , rational , love still ;</l>
     <l n="6663">In loving thou dost well , in passion not ,</l>
     <l n="6664">Wherein true love consists not : Love refines</l>
     <l n="6665">The thoughts , and heart enlarges ; hath his seat</l>
     <l n="6666">In reason , and is judicious ; is the scale</l>
     <l n="6667">By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend ,</l>
     <l n="6668">Not sunk in carnal pleasure ; for which cause ,</l>
     <l n="6669">Among the beasts no mate for thee was found .</l>
     <l n="6670">To whom thus , half abashed , Adam replied .</l>
     <l n="6671">Neither her outside formed so fair , nor aught</l>
     <l n="6672">In procreation common to all kinds ,</l>
     <l n="6673">( Though higher of the genial bed by far ,</l>
     <l n="6674">And with mysterious reverence I deem ,)</l>
     <l n="6675">So much delights me , as those graceful acts ,</l>
     <l n="6676">Those thousand decencies , that daily flow</l>
     <l n="6677">From all her words and actions mixed with love</l>
     <l n="6678">And sweet compliance , which declare unfeigned</l>
     <l n="6679">Union of mind , or in us both one soul ;</l>
     <l n="6680">Harmony to behold in wedded pair</l>
     <l n="6681">More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear .</l>
     <l n="6682">Yet these subject not ; I to thee disclose</l>
     <l n="6683">What inward thence I feel , not therefore foiled ,</l>
     <l n="6684">Who meet with various objects , from the sense</l>
     <l n="6685">Variously representing ; yet , still free ,</l>
     <l n="6686">Approve the best , and follow what I approve .</l>
     <l n="6687">To love , thou blamest me not ; for Love , thou sayest ,</l>
     <l n="6688">Leads up to Heaven , is both the way and guide ;</l>
     <l n="6689">Bear with me then , if lawful what I ask :</l>
     <l n="6690">Love not the heavenly Spirits , and how their love</l>
     <l n="6691">Express they ? by looks only ? or do they mix</l>
     <l n="6692">Irradiance , virtual or immediate touch ?</l>
     <l n="6693">To whom the Angel , with a smile that glowed</l>
     <l n="6694">Celestial rosy red , Love 's proper hue ,</l>
     <l n="6695">Answered . Let it suffice thee that thou knowest</l>
     <l n="6696">Us happy , and without love no happiness .</l>
     <l n="6697">Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest ,</l>
     <l n="6698">( And pure thou wert created ) we enjoy</l>
     <l n="6699">In eminence ; and obstacle find none</l>
     <l n="6700">Of membrane , joint , or limb , exclusive bars ;</l>
     <l n="6701">Easier than air with air , if Spirits embrace ,</l>
     <l n="6702">Total they mix , union of pure with pure</l>
     <l n="6703">Desiring , nor restrained conveyance need ,</l>
     <l n="6704">As flesh to mix with flesh , or soul with soul .</l>
     <l n="6705">But I can now no more ; the parting sun</l>
     <l n="6706">Beyond the Earth 's green Cape and verdant Isles</l>
     <l n="6707">Hesperian sets , my signal to depart .</l>
     <l n="6708">Be strong , live happy , and love ! But , first of all ,</l>
     <l n="6709">Him , whom to love is to obey , and keep</l>
     <l n="6710">His great command ; take heed lest passion sway</l>
     <l n="6711">Thy judgement to do aught , which else free will</l>
     <l n="6712">Would not admit : thine , and of all thy sons ,</l>
     <l n="6713">The weal or woe in thee is placed ; beware !</l>
     <l n="6714">I in thy persevering shall rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="6715">And all the Blest : Stand fast ; to stand or fall</l>
     <l n="6716">Free in thine own arbitrement it lies .</l>
     <l n="6717">Perfect within , no outward aid require ;</l>
     <l n="6718">And all temptation to transgress repel .</l>
     <l n="6719">So saying , he arose ; whom Adam thus</l>
     <l n="6720">Followed with benediction . Since to part ,</l>
     <l n="6721">Go , heavenly guest , ethereal Messenger ,</l>
     <l n="6722">Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore !</l>
     <l n="6723">Gentle to me and affable hath been</l>

     <l n="6780">‘ Twixt day and night , and now from end to end</l>
     <l n="6781">Night 's hemisphere had veil 'd the horizon round :</l>

     <l n="6787">By night he fled , and at midnight returned</l>
     <l n="6788">From compassing the earth ; cautious of day ,</l>
     <l n="6789">Since Uriel , regent of the sun , descried</l>
     <l n="6790">His entrance , and foreworned the Cherubim</l>
     <l n="6791">That kept their watch ; thence full of anguish driven ,</l>
     <l n="6792">The space of seven continued nights he rode</l>
     <l n="6793">With darkness ; thrice the equinoctial line</l>
     <l n="6794">He circled ; four times crossed the car of night</l>
     <l n="6795">From pole to pole , traversing each colure ;</l>
     <l n="6796">On the eighth returned ; and , on the coast averse</l>
     <l n="6797">From entrance or Cherubick watch , by stealth</l>
     <l n="6798">Found unsuspected way . There was a place ,</l>
     <l n="6799">Now not , though sin , not time , first wrought the change ,</l>
     <l n="6800">Where Tigris , at the foot of Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="6801">Into a gulf shot under ground , till part</l>
     <l n="6802">Rose up a fountain by the tree of life :</l>
     <l n="6803">In with the river sunk , and with it rose</l>
     <l n="6804">Satan , involved in rising mist ; then sought</l>
     <l n="6805">Where to lie hid ; sea he had searched , and land ,</l>
     <l n="6806">From Eden over Pontus and the pool</l>
     <l n="6807">Maeotis , up beyond the river Ob ;</l>
     <l n="6808">Downward as far antarctick ; and in length ,</l>
     <l n="6809">West from Orontes to the ocean barred</l>
     <l n="6810">At Darien ; thence to the land where flows</l>
     <l n="6811">Ganges and Indus : Thus the orb he roamed</l>
     <l n="6812">With narrow search ; and with inspection deep</l>
     <l n="6813">Considered every creature , which of all</l>
     <l n="6814">Most opportune might serve his wiles ; and found</l>
     <l n="6815">The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field .</l>
     <l n="6816">Him after long debate , irresolute</l>
     <l n="6817">Of thoughts revolved , his final sentence chose</l>
     <l n="6818">Fit vessel , fittest imp of fraud , in whom</l>
     <l n="6819">To enter , and his dark suggestions hide</l>
     <l n="6820">From sharpest sight : for , in the wily snake</l>
     <l n="6821">Whatever sleights , none would suspicious mark ,</l>
     <l n="6822">As from his wit and native subtlety</l>
     <l n="6823">Proceeding ; which , in other beasts observed ,</l>
     <l n="6824">Doubt might beget of diabolick power</l>
     <l n="6825">Active within , beyond the sense of brute .</l>
     <l n="6826">Thus he resolved , but first from inward grief</l>
     <l n="6827">His bursting passion into plaints thus poured .</l>
     <l n="6828">More justly , seat worthier of Gods , as built</l>
     <l n="6829">With second thoughts , reforming what was old !</l>
     <l n="6830">O Earth , how like to Heaven , if not preferred</l>
     <l n="6831">For what God , after better , worse would build ?</l>
     <l n="6832">Terrestrial Heaven , danced round by other Heavens</l>
     <l n="6833">That shine , yet bear their bright officious lamps ,</l>
     <l n="6834">Light above light , for thee alone , as seems ,</l>
     <l n="6835">In thee concentring all their precious beams</l>
     <l n="6836">Of sacred influence ! As God in Heaven</l>
     <l n="6837">Is center , yet extends to all ; so thou ,</l>
     <l n="6838">Centring , receivest from all those orbs : in thee ,</l>
     <l n="6839">Not in themselves , all their known virtue appears</l>
     <l n="6840">Productive in herb , plant , and nobler birth</l>
     <l n="6841">Of creatures animate with gradual life</l>
     <l n="6842">Of growth , sense , reason , all summed up in Man .</l>
     <l n="6843">With what delight could I have walked thee round ,</l>
     <l n="6844">If I could joy in aught , sweet interchange</l>
     <l n="6845">Of hill , and valley , rivers , woods , and plains ,</l>
     <l n="6846">Now land , now sea and shores with forest crowned ,</l>
     <l n="6847">Rocks , dens , and caves ! But I in none of these</l>
     <l n="6848">Find place or refuge ; and the more I see</l>
     <l n="6849">Pleasures about me , so much more I feel</l>
     <l n="6850">Torment within me , as from the hateful siege</l>
     <l n="6851">Of contraries : all good to me becomes</l>
     <l n="6852">Bane , and in Heaven much worse would be my state .</l>
     <l n="6853">But neither here seek I , no nor in Heaven</l>
     <l n="6854">To dwell , unless by mastering Heaven 's Supreme ;</l>
     <l n="6855">Nor hope to be myself less miserable</l>
     <l n="6856">By what I seek , but others to make such</l>
     <l n="6857">As I , though thereby worse to me redound :</l>
     <l n="6858">For only in destroying I find ease</l>
     <l n="6859">To my relentless thoughts ; and , him destroyed ,</l>
     <l n="6860">Or won to what may work his utter loss ,</l>
     <l n="6861">For whom all this was made , all this will soon</l>
     <l n="6862">Follow , as to him linked in weal or woe ;</l>
     <l n="6863">In woe then ; that destruction wide may range :</l>
     <l n="6864">To me shall be the glory sole among</l>
     <l n="6865">The infernal Powers , in one day to have marred</l>
     <l n="6866">What he , Almighty styled , six nights and days</l>
     <l n="6867">Continued making ; and who knows how long</l>
     <l n="6868">Before had been contriving ? though perhaps</l>
     <l n="6869">Not longer than since I , in one night , freed</l>
     <l n="6870">From servitude inglorious well nigh half</l>
     <l n="6871">The angelick name , and thinner left the throng</l>
     <l n="6872">Of his adorers : He , to be avenged ,</l>
     <l n="6873">And to repair his numbers thus impaired ,</l>
     <l n="6874">Whether such virtue spent of old now failed</l>
     <l n="6875">More Angels to create , if they at least</l>
     <l n="6876">Are his created , or , to spite us more ,</l>
     <l n="6877">Determined to advance into our room</l>
     <l n="6878">A creature formed of earth , and him endow ,</l>
     <l n="6879">Exalted from so base original ,</l>
     <l n="6880">With heavenly spoils , our spoils : What he decreed ,</l>
     <l n="6881">He effected ; Man he made , and for him built</l>
     <l n="6882">Magnificent this world , and earth his seat ,</l>
     <l n="6883">Him lord pronounced ; and , O indignity !</l>
     <l n="6884">Subjected to his service angel-wings ,</l>
     <l n="6885">And flaming ministers to watch and tend</l>
     <l n="6886">Their earthly charge : Of these the vigilance</l>
     <l n="6887">I dread ; and , to elude , thus wrapt in mist</l>
     <l n="6888">Of midnight vapour glide obscure , and pry</l>
     <l n="6889">In every bush and brake , where hap may find</l>
     <l n="6890">The serpent sleeping ; in whose mazy folds</l>
     <l n="6891">To hide me , and the dark intent I bring .</l>
     <l n="6892">O foul descent ! that I , who erst contended</l>
     <l n="6893">With Gods to sit the highest , am now constrained</l>
     <l n="6894">Into a beast ; and , mixed with bestial slime ,</l>
     <l n="6895">This essence to incarnate and imbrute ,</l>
     <l n="6896">That to the highth of Deity aspired !</l>
     <l n="6897">But what will not ambition and revenge</l>
     <l n="6898">Descend to ? Who aspires , must down as low</l>
     <l n="6899">As high he soared ; obnoxious , first or last ,</l>
     <l n="6900">To basest things . Revenge , at first though sweet ,</l>
     <l n="6901">Bitter ere long , back on itself recoils :</l>
     <l n="6902">Let it ; I reck not , so it light well aimed ,</l>
     <l n="6903">Since higher I fall short , on him who next</l>
     <l n="6904">Provokes my envy , this new favourite</l>
     <l n="6905">Of Heaven , this man of clay , son of despite ,</l>
     <l n="6906">Whom , us the more to spite , his Maker raised</l>
     <l n="6907">From dust : Spite then with spite is best repaid .</l>
     <l n="6908">So saying , through each thicket dank or dry ,</l>
     <l n="6909">Like a black mist low-creeping , he held on</l>
     <l n="6910">His midnight-search , where soonest he might find</l>
     <l n="6911">The serpent ; him fast-sleeping soon he found</l>
     <l n="6912">In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled ,</l>
     <l n="6913">His head the midst , well stored with subtile wiles :</l>
     <l n="6914">Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den ,</l>
     <l n="6915">Nor nocent yet ; but , on the grassy herb ,</l>
     <l n="6916">Fearless unfeared he slept : in at his mouth</l>
     <l n="6917">The Devil entered ; and his brutal sense ,</l>
     <l n="6918">In heart or head , possessing , soon inspired</l>
     <l n="6919">With act intelligential ; but his sleep</l>
     <l n="6920">Disturbed not , waiting close the approach of morn .</l>
     <l n="6921">Now , when as sacred light began to dawn</l>
     <l n="6922">In Eden on the humid flowers , that breathed</l>
     <l n="6923">Their morning incense , when all things , that breathe ,</l>
     <l n="6924">From the Earth 's great altar send up silent praise</l>
     <l n="6925">To the Creator , and his nostrils fill</l>
     <l n="6926">With grateful smell , forth came the human pair ,</l>
     <l n="6927">And joined their vocal worship to the quire</l>
     <l n="6928">Of creatures wanting voice ; that done , partake</l>
     <l n="6929">The season prime for sweetest scents and airs :</l>
     <l n="6930">Then commune , how that day they best may ply</l>
     <l n="6931">Their growing work : for much their work out-grew</l>
     <l n="6932">The hands ’ dispatch of two gardening so wide ,</l>
     <l n="6933">And Eve first to her husband thus began .</l>
     <l n="6934">Adam , well may we labour still to dress</l>
     <l n="6935">This garden , still to tend plant , herb , and flower ,</l>
     <l n="6936">Our pleasant task enjoined ; but , till more hands</l>
     <l n="6937">Aid us , the work under our labour grows ,</l>
     <l n="6938">Luxurious by restraint ; what we by day</l>
     <l n="6939">Lop overgrown , or prune , or prop , or bind ,</l>
     <l n="6940">One night or two with wanton growth derides</l>
     <l n="6941">Tending to wild . Thou therefore now advise ,</l>
     <l n="6942">Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present :</l>
     <l n="6943">Let us divide our labours ; thou , where choice</l>
     <l n="6944">Leads thee , or where most needs , whether to wind</l>
     <l n="6945">The woodbine round this arbour , or direct</l>
     <l n="6946">The clasping ivy where to climb ; while I ,</l>
     <l n="6947">In yonder spring of roses intermixed</l>
     <l n="6948">With myrtle , find what to redress till noon :</l>
     <l n="6949">For , while so near each other thus all day</l>
     <l n="6950">Our task we choose , what wonder if so near</l>
     <l n="6951">Looks intervene and smiles , or object new</l>
     <l n="6952">Casual discourse draw on ; which intermits</l>
     <l n="6953">Our day 's work , brought to little , though begun</l>
     <l n="6954">Early , and the hour of supper comes unearned ?</l>
     <l n="6955">To whom mild answer Adam thus returned .</l>
     <l n="6956">Sole Eve , associate sole , to me beyond</l>
     <l n="6957">Compare above all living creatures dear !</l>
     <l n="6958">Well hast thou motioned , well thy thoughts employed ,</l>
     <l n="6959">How we might best fulfil the work which here</l>
     <l n="6960">God hath assigned us ; nor of me shalt pass</l>
     <l n="6961">Unpraised : for nothing lovelier can be found</l>
     <l n="6962">In woman , than to study houshold good ,</l>
     <l n="6963">And good works in her husband to promote .</l>
     <l n="6964">Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed</l>
     <l n="6965">Labour , as to debar us when we need</l>
     <l n="6966">Refreshment , whether food , or talk between ,</l>
     <l n="6967">Food of the mind , or this sweet intercourse</l>
     <l n="6968">Of looks and smiles ; for smiles from reason flow ,</l>
     <l n="6969">To brute denied , and are of love the food ;</l>
     <l n="6970">Love , not the lowest end of human life .</l>
     <l n="6971">For not to irksome toil , but to delight ,</l>
     <l n="6972">He made us , and delight to reason joined .</l>
     <l n="6973">These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands</l>
     <l n="6974">Will keep from wilderness with ease , as wide</l>
     <l n="6975">As we need walk , till younger hands ere long</l>
     <l n="6976">Assist us ; But , if much converse perhaps</l>
     <l n="6977">Thee satiate , to short absence I could yield :</l>
     <l n="6978">For solitude sometimes is best society ,</l>
     <l n="6979">And short retirement urges sweet return .</l>
     <l n="6980">But other doubt possesses me , lest harm</l>
     <l n="6981">Befall thee severed from me ; for thou knowest</l>
     <l n="6982">What hath been warned us , what malicious foe</l>
     <l n="6983">Envying our happiness , and of his own</l>
     <l n="6984">Despairing , seeks to work us woe and shame</l>
     <l n="6985">By sly assault ; and somewhere nigh at hand</l>
     <l n="6986">Watches , no doubt , with greedy hope to find</l>
     <l n="6987">His wish and best advantage , us asunder ;</l>
     <l n="6988">Hopeless to circumvent us joined , where each</l>
     <l n="6989">To other speedy aid might lend at need :</l>
     <l n="6990">Whether his first design be to withdraw</l>
     <l n="6991">Our fealty from God , or to disturb</l>
     <l n="6992">Conjugal love , than which perhaps no bliss</l>
     <l n="6993">Enjoyed by us excites his envy more ;</l>
     <l n="6994">Or this , or worse , leave not the faithful side</l>
     <l n="6995">That gave thee being , still shades thee , and protects .</l>
     <l n="6996">The wife , where danger or dishonour lurks ,</l>
     <l n="6997">Safest and seemliest by her husband stays ,</l>
     <l n="6998">Who guards her , or with her the worst endures .</l>
     <l n="6999">To whom the virgin majesty of Eve ,</l>
     <l n="7000">As one who loves , and some unkindness meets ,</l>
     <l n="7001">With sweet austere composure thus replied .</l>
     <l n="7002">Offspring of Heaven and Earth , and all Earth 's Lord !</l>
     <l n="7003">That such an enemy we have , who seeks</l>
     <l n="7004">Our ruin , both by thee informed I learn ,</l>
     <l n="7005">And from the parting Angel over-heard ,</l>
     <l n="7006">As in a shady nook I stood behind ,</l>
     <l n="7007">Just then returned at shut of evening flowers .</l>
     <l n="7008">But , that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt</l>
     <l n="7009">To God or thee , because we have a foe</l>
     <l n="7010">May tempt it , I expected not to hear .</l>
     <l n="7011">His violence thou fearest not , being such</l>
     <l n="7012">As we , not capable of death or pain ,</l>
     <l n="7013">Can either not receive , or can repel .</l>
     <l n="7014">His fraud is then thy fear ; which plain infers</l>
     <l n="7015">Thy equal fear , that my firm faith and love</l>
     <l n="7016">Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced ;</l>
     <l n="7017">Thoughts , which how found they harbour in thy breast ,</l>
     <l n="7018">Adam , mis-thought of her to thee so dear ?</l>
     <l n="7019">To whom with healing words Adam replied .</l>
     <l n="7020">Daughter of God and Man , immortal Eve !</l>
     <l n="7021">For such thou art ; from sin and blame entire :</l>
     <l n="7022">Not diffident of thee do I dissuade</l>
     <l n="7023">Thy absence from my sight , but to avoid</l>
     <l n="7024">The attempt itself , intended by our foe .</l>
     <l n="7025">For he who tempts , though in vain , at least asperses</l>
     <l n="7026">The tempted with dishonour foul ; supposed</l>
     <l n="7027">Not incorruptible of faith , not proof</l>
     <l n="7028">Against temptation : Thou thyself with scorn</l>
     <l n="7029">And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong ,</l>
     <l n="7030">Though ineffectual found : misdeem not then ,</l>
     <l n="7031">If such affront I labour to avert</l>
     <l n="7032">From thee alone , which on us both at once</l>
     <l n="7033">The enemy , though bold , will hardly dare ;</l>
     <l n="7034">Or daring , first on me the assault shall light .</l>
     <l n="7035">Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn ;</l>
     <l n="7036">Subtle he needs must be , who could seduce</l>
     <l n="7037">Angels ; nor think superfluous other 's aid .</l>
     <l n="7038">I , from the influence of thy looks , receive</l>
     <l n="7039">Access in every virtue ; in thy sight</l>
     <l n="7040">More wise , more watchful , stronger , if need were</l>
     <l n="7041">Of outward strength ; while shame , thou looking on ,</l>
     <l n="7042">Shame to be overcome or over-reached ,</l>
     <l n="7043">Would utmost vigour raise , and raised unite .</l>
     <l n="7044">Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel</l>
     <l n="7045">When I am present , and thy trial choose</l>
     <l n="7046">With me , best witness of thy virtue tried ?</l>
     <l n="7047">So spake domestick Adam in his care</l>
     <l n="7048">And matrimonial love ; but Eve , who thought</l>
     <l n="7049">Less attributed to her faith sincere ,</l>
     <l n="7050">Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed .</l>
     <l n="7051">If this be our condition , thus to dwell</l>
     <l n="7052">In narrow circuit straitened by a foe ,</l>
     <l n="7053">Subtle or violent , we not endued</l>
     <l n="7054">Single with like defence , wherever met ;</l>
     <l n="7055">How are we happy , still in fear of harm ?</l>
     <l n="7056">But harm precedes not sin : only our foe ,</l>
     <l n="7057">Tempting , affronts us with his foul esteem</l>
     <l n="7058">Of our integrity : his foul esteem</l>
     <l n="7059">Sticks no dishonour on our front , but turns</l>
     <l n="7060">Foul on himself ; then wherefore shunned or feared</l>
     <l n="7061">By us ? who rather double honour gain</l>
     <l n="7062">From his surmise proved false ; find peace within ,</l>
     <l n="7063">Favour from Heaven , our witness , from the event .</l>
     <l n="7064">And what is faith , love , virtue , unassayed</l>
     <l n="7065">Alone , without exteriour help sustained ?</l>
     <l n="7066">Let us not then suspect our happy state</l>
     <l n="7067">Left so imperfect by the Maker wise ,</l>
     <l n="7068">As not secure to single or combined .</l>
     <l n="7069">Frail is our happiness , if this be so ,</l>
     <l n="7070">And Eden were no Eden , thus exposed .</l>
     <l n="7071">To whom thus Adam fervently replied .</l>
     <l n="7072">O Woman , best are all things as the will</l>
     <l n="7073">Of God ordained them : His creating hand</l>
     <l n="7074">Nothing imperfect or deficient left</l>
     <l n="7075">Of all that he created , much less Man ,</l>
     <l n="7076">Or aught that might his happy state secure ,</l>
     <l n="7077">Secure from outward force ; within himself</l>
     <l n="7078">The danger lies , yet lies within his power :</l>
     <l n="7079">Against his will he can receive no harm .</l>
     <l n="7080">But God left free the will ; for what obeys</l>
     <l n="7081">Reason , is free ; and Reason he made right ,</l>
     <l n="7082">But bid her well be ware , and still erect ;</l>
     <l n="7083">Lest , by some fair-appearing good surprised ,</l>
     <l n="7084">She dictate false ; and mis-inform the will</l>
     <l n="7085">To do what God expressly hath forbid .</l>
     <l n="7086">Not then mistrust , but tender love , enjoins ,</l>
     <l n="7087">That I should mind thee oft ; and mind thou me .</l>
     <l n="7088">Firm we subsist , yet possible to swerve ;</l>
     <l n="7089">Since Reason not impossibly may meet</l>
     <l n="7090">Some specious object by the foe suborned ,</l>
     <l n="7091">And fall into deception unaware ,</l>
     <l n="7092">Not keeping strictest watch , as she was warned .</l>
     <l n="7093">Seek not temptation then , which to avoid</l>
     <l n="7094">Were better , and most likely if from me</l>
     <l n="7095">Thou sever not : Trial will come unsought .</l>
     <l n="7096">Wouldst thou approve thy constancy , approve</l>
     <l n="7097">First thy obedience ; the other who can know ,</l>
     <l n="7098">Not seeing thee attempted , who attest ?</l>
     <l n="7099">But , if thou think , trial unsought may find</l>
     <l n="7100">Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest ,</l>
     <l n="7101">Go ; for thy stay , not free , absents thee more ;</l>
     <l n="7102">Go in thy native innocence , rely</l>
     <l n="7103">On what thou hast of virtue ; summon all !</l>
     <l n="7104">For God towards thee hath done his part , do thine .</l>
     <l n="7105">So spake the patriarch of mankind ; but Eve</l>
     <l n="7106">Persisted ; yet submiss , though last , replied .</l>
     <l n="7107">With thy permission then , and thus forewarned</l>
     <l n="7108">Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words</l>
     <l n="7109">Touched only ; that our trial , when least sought ,</l>
     <l n="7110">May find us both perhaps far less prepared ,</l>
     <l n="7111">The willinger I go , nor much expect</l>
     <l n="7112">A foe so proud will first the weaker seek ;</l>
     <l n="7113">So bent , the more shall shame him his repulse .</l>
     <l n="7114">Thus saying , from her husband 's hand her hand</l>
     <l n="7115">Soft she withdrew ; and , like a Wood-Nymph light ,</l>
     <l n="7116">Oread or Dryad , or of Delia 's train ,</l>
     <l n="7117">Betook her to the groves ; but Delia 's self</l>
     <l n="7118">In gait surpassed , and Goddess-like deport ,</l>
     <l n="7119">Though not as she with bow and quiver armed ,</l>
     <l n="7120">But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude ,</l>
     <l n="7121">Guiltless of fire , had formed , or Angels brought .</l>
     <l n="7122">To Pales , or Pomona , thus adorned ,</l>
     <l n="7123">Likest she seemed , Pomona when she fled</l>
     <l n="7124">Vertumnus , or to Ceres in her prime ,</l>
     <l n="7125">Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove .</l>
     <l n="7126">Her long with ardent look his eye pursued</l>
     <l n="7127">Delighted , but desiring more her stay .</l>
     <l n="7128">Oft he to her his charge of quick return</l>
     <l n="7129">Repeated ; she to him as oft engaged</l>
     <l n="7130">To be returned by noon amid the bower ,</l>
     <l n="7131">And all things in best order to invite</l>
     <l n="7132">Noontide repast , or afternoon 's repose .</l>
     <l n="7133">O much deceived , much failing , hapless Eve ,</l>
     <l n="7134">Of thy presumed return ! event perverse !</l>
     <l n="7135">Thou never from that hour in Paradise</l>
     <l n="7136">Foundst either sweet repast , or sound repose ;</l>
     <l n="7137">Such ambush , hid among sweet flowers and shades ,</l>
     <l n="7138">Waited with hellish rancour imminent</l>
     <l n="7139">To intercept thy way , or send thee back</l>
     <l n="7140">Despoiled of innocence , of faith , of bliss !</l>
     <l n="7141">For now , and since first break of dawn , the Fiend ,</l>
     <l n="7142">Mere serpent in appearance , forth was come ;</l>
     <l n="7143">And on his quest , where likeliest he might find</l>
     <l n="7144">The only two of mankind , but in them</l>
     <l n="7145">The whole included race , his purposed prey .</l>
     <l n="7146">In bower and field he sought , where any tuft</l>
     <l n="7147">Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay ,</l>
     <l n="7148">Their tendance , or plantation for delight ;</l>
     <l n="7149">By fountain or by shady rivulet</l>
     <l n="7150">He sought them both , but wished his hap might find</l>
     <l n="7151">Eve separate ; he wished , but not with hope</l>
     <l n="7152">Of what so seldom chanced ; when to his wish ,</l>
     <l n="7153">Beyond his hope , Eve separate he spies ,</l>
     <l n="7154">Veiled in a cloud of fragrance , where she stood ,</l>
     <l n="7155">Half spied , so thick the roses blushing round</l>
     <l n="7156">About her glowed , oft stooping to support</l>
     <l n="7157">Each flower of slender stalk , whose head , though gay</l>
     <l n="7158">Carnation , purple , azure , or specked with gold ,</l>
     <l n="7159">Hung drooping unsustained ; them she upstays</l>
     <l n="7160">Gently with myrtle band , mindless the while</l>
     <l n="7161">Herself , though fairest unsupported flower ,</l>
     <l n="7162">From her best prop so far , and storm so nigh .</l>
     <l n="7163">Nearer he drew , and many a walk traversed</l>
     <l n="7164">Of stateliest covert , cedar , pine , or palm ;</l>
     <l n="7165">Then voluble and bold , now hid , now seen ,</l>
     <l n="7166">Among thick-woven arborets , and flowers</l>
     <l n="7167">Imbordered on each bank , the hand of Eve :</l>
     <l n="7168">Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned</l>
     <l n="7169">Or of revived Adonis , or renowned</l>
     <l n="7170">Alcinous , host of old Laertes ’ son ;</l>
     <l n="7171">Or that , not mystick , where the sapient king</l>
     <l n="7172">Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse .</l>
     <l n="7173">Much he the place admired , the person more .</l>
     <l n="7174">As one who long in populous city pent ,</l>
     <l n="7175">Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air ,</l>
     <l n="7176">Forth issuing on a summer 's morn , to breathe</l>
     <l n="7177">Among the pleasant villages and farms</l>
     <l n="7178">Adjoined , from each thing met conceives delight ;</l>
     <l n="7179">The smell of grain , or tedded grass , or kine ,</l>
     <l n="7180">Or dairy , each rural sight , each rural sound ;</l>
     <l n="7181">If chance , with nymph-like step , fair virgin pass ,</l>
     <l n="7182">What pleasing seemed , for her now pleases more ;</l>
     <l n="7183">She most , and in her look sums all delight :</l>
     <l n="7184">Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold</l>
     <l n="7185">This flowery plat , the sweet recess of Eve</l>
     <l n="7186">Thus early , thus alone : Her heavenly form</l>
     <l n="7187">Angelick , but more soft , and feminine ,</l>
     <l n="7188">Her graceful innocence , her every air</l>
     <l n="7189">Of gesture , or least action , overawed</l>
     <l n="7190">His malice , and with rapine sweet bereaved</l>
     <l n="7191">His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought :</l>
     <l n="7192">That space the Evil-one abstracted stood</l>
     <l n="7193">From his own evil , and for the time remained</l>
     <l n="7194">Stupidly good ; of enmity disarmed ,</l>
     <l n="7195">Of guile , of hate , of envy , of revenge :</l>
     <l n="7196">But the hot Hell that always in him burns ,</l>
     <l n="7197">Though in mid Heaven , soon ended his delight ,</l>
     <l n="7198">And tortures him now more , the more he sees</l>
     <l n="7199">Of pleasure , not for him ordained : then soon</l>
     <l n="7200">Fierce hate he recollects , and all his thoughts</l>
     <l n="7201">Of mischief , gratulating , thus excites .</l>
     <l n="7202">Thoughts , whither have ye led me ! with what sweet</l>
     <l n="7203">Compulsion thus transported , to forget</l>
     <l n="7204">What hither brought us ! hate , not love ; nor hope</l>
     <l n="7205">Of Paradise for Hell , hope here to taste</l>
     <l n="7206">Of pleasure ; but all pleasure to destroy ,</l>
     <l n="7207">Save what is in destroying ; other joy</l>
     <l n="7208">To me is lost . Then , let me not let pass</l>
     <l n="7209">Occasion which now smiles ; behold alone</l>
     <l n="7210">The woman , opportune to all attempts ,</l>
     <l n="7211">Her husband , for I view far round , not nigh ,</l>
     <l n="7212">Whose higher intellectual more I shun ,</l>
     <l n="7213">And strength , of courage haughty , and of limb</l>
     <l n="7214">Heroick built , though of terrestrial mould ;</l>
     <l n="7215">Foe not informidable ! exempt from wound ,</l>
     <l n="7216">I not ; so much hath Hell debased , and pain</l>
     <l n="7217">Enfeebled me , to what I was in Heaven .</l>
     <l n="7218">She fair , divinely fair , fit love for Gods !</l>
     <l n="7219">Not terrible , though terrour be in love</l>
     <l n="7220">And beauty , not approached by stronger hate ,</l>
     <l n="7221">Hate stronger , under show of love well feigned ;</l>
     <l n="7222">The way which to her ruin now I tend .</l>
     <l n="7223">So spake the enemy of mankind , enclosed</l>
     <l n="7224">In serpent , inmate bad ! and toward Eve</l>
     <l n="7225">Addressed his way : not with indented wave ,</l>
     <l n="7226">Prone on the ground , as since ; but on his rear ,</l>
     <l n="7227">Circular base of rising folds , that towered</l>
     <l n="7228">Fold above fold , a surging maze ! his head</l>
     <l n="7229">Crested aloft , and carbuncle his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="7230">With burnished neck of verdant gold , erect</l>
     <l n="7231">Amidst his circling spires , that on the grass</l>
     <l n="7232">Floated redundant : pleasing was his shape</l>
     <l n="7233">And lovely ; never since of serpent-kind</l>
     <l n="7234">Lovelier , not those that in Illyria changed ,</l>
     <l n="7235">Hermione and Cadmus , or the god</l>
     <l n="7236">In Epidaurus ; nor to which transformed</l>
     <l n="7237">Ammonian Jove , or Capitoline , was seen ;</l>
     <l n="7238">He with Olympias ; this with her who bore</l>
     <l n="7239">Scipio , the highth of Rome . With tract oblique</l>
     <l n="7240">At first , as one who sought access , but feared</l>
     <l n="7241">To interrupt , side-long he works his way .</l>
     <l n="7242">As when a ship , by skilful steersmen wrought</l>
     <l n="7243">Nigh river 's mouth or foreland , where the wind</l>
     <l n="7244">Veers oft , as oft so steers , and shifts her sail :</l>
     <l n="7245">So varied he , and of his tortuous train</l>
     <l n="7246">Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve ,</l>
     <l n="7247">To lure her eye ; she , busied , heard the sound</l>
     <l n="7248">Of rusling leaves , but minded not , as used</l>
     <l n="7249">To such disport before her through the field ,</l>
     <l n="7250">From every beast ; more duteous at her call ,</l>
     <l n="7251">Than at Circean call the herd disguised .</l>
     <l n="7252">He , bolder now , uncalled before her stood ,</l>
     <l n="7253">But as in gaze admiring : oft he bowed</l>
     <l n="7254">His turret crest , and sleek enamelled neck ,</l>
     <l n="7255">Fawning ; and licked the ground whereon she trod .</l>
     <l n="7256">His gentle dumb expression turned at length</l>
     <l n="7257">The eye of Eve to mark his play ; he , glad</l>
     <l n="7258">Of her attention gained , with serpent-tongue</l>
     <l n="7259">Organick , or impulse of vocal air ,</l>
     <l n="7260">His fraudulent temptation thus began .</l>
     <l n="7261">Wonder not , sovran Mistress , if perhaps</l>
     <l n="7262">Thou canst , who art sole wonder ! much less arm</l>
     <l n="7263">Thy looks , the Heaven of mildness , with disdain ,</l>
     <l n="7264">Displeased that I approach thee thus , and gaze</l>
     <l n="7265">Insatiate ; I thus single ; nor have feared</l>
     <l n="7266">Thy awful brow , more awful thus retired .</l>
     <l n="7267">Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair ,</l>
     <l n="7268">Thee all things living gaze on , all things thine</l>
     <l n="7269">By gift , and thy celestial beauty adore</l>
     <l n="7270">With ravishment beheld ! there best beheld ,</l>
     <l n="7271">Where universally admired ; but here</l>
     <l n="7272">In this enclosure wild , these beasts among ,</l>
     <l n="7273">Beholders rude , and shallow to discern</l>
     <l n="7274">Half what in thee is fair , one man except ,</l>
     <l n="7275">Who sees thee ? and what is one ? who should be seen</l>
     <l n="7276">A Goddess among Gods , adored and served</l>
     <l n="7277">By Angels numberless , thy daily train .</l>
     <l n="7278">So glozed the Tempter , and his proem tuned :</l>
     <l n="7279">Into the heart of Eve his words made way ,</l>
     <l n="7280">Though at the voice much marvelling ; at length ,</l>
     <l n="7281">Not unamazed , she thus in answer spake .</l>
     <l n="7282">What may this mean ? language of man pronounced</l>
     <l n="7283">By tongue of brute , and human sense expressed ?</l>
     <l n="7284">The first , at least , of these I thought denied</l>
     <l n="7285">To beasts ; whom God , on their creation-day ,</l>
     <l n="7286">Created mute to all articulate sound :</l>
     <l n="7287">The latter I demur ; for in their looks</l>
     <l n="7288">Much reason , and in their actions , oft appears .</l>
     <l n="7289">Thee , Serpent , subtlest beast of all the field</l>
     <l n="7290">I knew , but not with human voice endued ;</l>
     <l n="7291">Redouble then this miracle , and say ,</l>
     <l n="7292">How camest thou speakable of mute , and how</l>
     <l n="7293">To me so friendly grown above the rest</l>
     <l n="7294">Of brutal kind , that daily are in sight ?</l>
     <l n="7295">Say , for such wonder claims attention due .</l>
     <l n="7296">To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied .</l>
     <l n="7297">Empress of this fair world , resplendent Eve !</l>
     <l n="7298">Easy to me it is to tell thee all</l>
     <l n="7299">What thou commandest ; and right thou shouldst be obeyed :</l>
     <l n="7300">I was at first as other beasts that graze</l>
     <l n="7301">The trodden herb , of abject thoughts and low ,</l>
     <l n="7302">As was my food ; nor aught but food discerned</l>
     <l n="7303">Or sex , and apprehended nothing high :</l>
     <l n="7304">Till , on a day roving the field , I chanced</l>
     <l n="7305">A goodly tree far distant to behold</l>
     <l n="7306">Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed ,</l>
     <l n="7307">Ruddy and gold : I nearer drew to gaze ;</l>
     <l n="7308">When from the boughs a savoury odour blown ,</l>
     <l n="7309">Grateful to appetite , more pleased my sense</l>
     <l n="7310">Than smell of sweetest fennel , or the teats</l>
     <l n="7311">Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even ,</l>
     <l n="7312">Unsucked of lamb or kid , that tend their play .</l>
     <l n="7313">To satisfy the sharp desire I had</l>
     <l n="7314">Of tasting those fair apples , I resolved</l>
     <l n="7315">Not to defer ; hunger and thirst at once ,</l>
     <l n="7316">Powerful persuaders , quickened at the scent</l>
     <l n="7317">Of that alluring fruit , urged me so keen .</l>
     <l n="7318">About the mossy trunk I wound me soon ;</l>
     <l n="7319">For , high from ground , the branches would require</l>
     <l n="7320">Thy utmost reach or Adam 's : Round the tree</l>
     <l n="7321">All other beasts that saw , with like desire</l>
     <l n="7322">Longing and envying stood , but could not reach .</l>
     <l n="7323">Amid the tree now got , where plenty hung</l>
     <l n="7324">Tempting so nigh , to pluck and eat my fill</l>
     <l n="7325">I spared not ; for , such pleasure till that hour ,</l>
     <l n="7326">At feed or fountain , never had I found .</l>
     <l n="7327">Sated at length , ere long I might perceive</l>
     <l n="7328">Strange alteration in me , to degree</l>
     <l n="7329">Of reason in my inward powers ; and speech</l>
     <l n="7330">Wanted not long ; though to this shape retained .</l>
     <l n="7331">Thenceforth to speculations high or deep</l>
     <l n="7332">I turned my thoughts , and with capacious mind</l>
     <l n="7333">Considered all things visible in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="7334">Or Earth , or Middle ; all things fair and good :</l>
     <l n="7335">But all that fair and good in thy divine</l>
     <l n="7336">Semblance , and in thy beauty 's heavenly ray ,</l>
     <l n="7337">United I beheld ; no fair to thine</l>
     <l n="7338">Equivalent or second ! which compelled</l>
     <l n="7339">Me thus , though importune perhaps , to come</l>
     <l n="7340">And gaze , and worship thee of right declared</l>
     <l n="7341">Sovran of creatures , universal Dame !</l>
     <l n="7342">So talked the spirited sly Snake ; and Eve ,</l>
     <l n="7343">Yet more amazed , unwary thus replied .</l>
     <l n="7344">Serpent , thy overpraising leaves in doubt</l>
     <l n="7345">The virtue of that fruit , in thee first proved :</l>
     <l n="7346">But say , where grows the tree ? from hence how far ?</l>
     <l n="7347">For many are the trees of God that grow</l>
     <l n="7348">In Paradise , and various , yet unknown</l>
     <l n="7349">To us ; in such abundance lies our choice ,</l>
     <l n="7350">As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched ,</l>
     <l n="7351">Still hanging incorruptible , till men</l>
     <l n="7352">Grow up to their provision , and more hands</l>
     <l n="7353">Help to disburden Nature of her birth .</l>
     <l n="7354">To whom the wily Adder , blithe and glad .</l>
     <l n="7355">Empress , the way is ready , and not long ;</l>
     <l n="7356">Beyond a row of myrtles , on a flat ,</l>
     <l n="7357">Fast by a fountain , one small thicket past</l>
     <l n="7358">Of blowing myrrh and balm : if thou accept</l>
     <l n="7359">My conduct , I can bring thee thither soon</l>
     <l n="7360">Lead then , said Eve . He , leading , swiftly rolled</l>
     <l n="7361">In tangles , and made intricate seem straight ,</l>
     <l n="7362">To mischief swift . Hope elevates , and joy</l>
     <l n="7363">Brightens his crest ; as when a wandering fire ,</l>
     <l n="7364">Compact of unctuous vapour , which the night</l>
     <l n="7365">Condenses , and the cold environs round ,</l>
     <l n="7366">Kindled through agitation to a flame ,</l>
     <l n="7367">Which oft , they say , some evil Spirit attends ,</l>
     <l n="7368">Hovering and blazing with delusive light ,</l>
     <l n="7369">Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way</l>
     <l n="7370">To bogs and mires , and oft through pond or pool ;</l>
     <l n="7371">There swallowed up and lost , from succour far .</l>
     <l n="7372">So glistered the dire Snake , and into fraud</l>
     <l n="7373">Led Eve , our credulous mother , to the tree</l>
     <l n="7374">Of prohibition , root of all our woe ;</l>
     <l n="7375">Which when she saw , thus to her guide she spake .</l>
     <l n="7376">Serpent , we might have spared our coming hither ,</l>
     <l n="7377">Fruitless to me , though fruit be here to excess ,</l>
     <l n="7378">The credit of whose virtue rest with thee ;</l>
     <l n="7379">Wonderous indeed , if cause of such effects .</l>
     <l n="7380">But of this tree we may not taste nor touch ;</l>
     <l n="7381">God so commanded , and left that command</l>
     <l n="7382">Sole daughter of his voice ; the rest , we live</l>
     <l n="7383">Law to ourselves ; our reason is our law .</l>
     <l n="7384">To whom the Tempter guilefully replied .</l>
     <l n="7385">Indeed ! hath God then said that of the fruit</l>
     <l n="7386">Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat ,</l>
     <l n="7387">Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air ?</l>
     <l n="7388">To whom thus Eve , yet sinless . Of the fruit</l>
     <l n="7389">Of each tree in the garden we may eat ;</l>
     <l n="7390">But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst</l>
     <l n="7391">The garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat</l>
     <l n="7392">Thereof , nor shall ye touch it , lest ye die .</l>
     <l n="7393">She scarce had said , though brief , when now more bold</l>
     <l n="7394">The Tempter , but with show of zeal and love</l>
     <l n="7395">To Man , and indignation at his wrong ,</l>
     <l n="7396">New part puts on ; and , as to passion moved ,</l>
     <l n="7397">Fluctuates disturbed , yet comely and in act</l>
     <l n="7398">Raised , as of some great matter to begin .</l>
     <l n="7399">As when of old some orator renowned ,</l>
     <l n="7400">In Athens or free Rome , where eloquence</l>
     <l n="7401">Flourished , since mute ! to some great cause addressed ,</l>
     <l n="7402">Stood in himself collected ; while each part ,</l>
     <l n="7403">Motion , each act , won audience ere the tongue ;</l>
     <l n="7404">Sometimes in highth began , as no delay</l>
     <l n="7405">Of preface brooking , through his zeal of right :</l>
     <l n="7406">So standing , moving , or to highth up grown ,</l>
     <l n="7407">The Tempter , all impassioned , thus began .</l>
     <l n="7408">O sacred , wise , and wisdom-giving Plant ,</l>
     <l n="7409">Mother of science ! now I feel thy power</l>
     <l n="7410">Within me clear ; not only to discern</l>
     <l n="7411">Things in their causes , but to trace the ways</l>
     <l n="7412">Of highest agents , deemed however wise .</l>
     <l n="7413">Queen of this universe ! do not believe</l>
     <l n="7414">Those rigid threats of death : ye shall not die :</l>
     <l n="7415">How should you ? by the fruit ? it gives you life</l>
     <l n="7416">To knowledge ; by the threatener ? look on me ,</l>
     <l n="7417">Me , who have touched and tasted ; yet both live ,</l>
     <l n="7418">And life more perfect have attained than Fate</l>
     <l n="7419">Meant me , by venturing higher than my lot .</l>
     <l n="7420">Shall that be shut to Man , which to the Beast</l>
     <l n="7421">Is open ? or will God incense his ire</l>
     <l n="7422">For such a petty trespass ? and not praise</l>
     <l n="7423">Rather your dauntless virtue , whom the pain</l>
     <l n="7424">Of death denounced , whatever thing death be ,</l>
     <l n="7425">Deterred not from achieving what might lead</l>
     <l n="7426">To happier life , knowledge of good and evil ;</l>
     <l n="7427">Of good , how just ? of evil , if what is evil</l>
     <l n="7428">Be real , why not known , since easier shunned ?</l>
     <l n="7429">God therefore cannot hurt ye , and be just ;</l>
     <l n="7430">Not just , not God ; not feared then , nor obeyed :</l>
     <l n="7431">Your fear itself of death removes the fear .</l>
     <l n="7432">Why then was this forbid ? Why , but to awe ;</l>
     <l n="7433">Why , but to keep ye low and ignorant ,</l>
     <l n="7434">His worshippers ? He knows that in the day</l>
     <l n="7435">Ye eat thereof , your eyes that seem so clear ,</l>
     <l n="7436">Yet are but dim , shall perfectly be then</l>
     <l n="7437">Opened and cleared , and ye shall be as Gods ,</l>
     <l n="7438">Knowing both good and evil , as they know .</l>
     <l n="7439">That ye shall be as Gods , since I as Man ,</l>
     <l n="7440">Internal Man , is but proportion meet ;</l>
     <l n="7441">I , of brute , human ; ye , of human , Gods .</l>
     <l n="7442">So ye shall die perhaps , by putting off</l>
     <l n="7443">Human , to put on Gods ; death to be wished ,</l>
     <l n="7444">Though threatened , which no worse than this can bring .</l>
     <l n="7445">And what are Gods , that Man may not become</l>
     <l n="7446">As they , participating God-like food ?</l>
     <l n="7447">The Gods are first , and that advantage use</l>
     <l n="7448">On our belief , that all from them proceeds :</l>
     <l n="7449">I question it ; for this fair earth I see ,</l>
     <l n="7450">Warmed by the sun , producing every kind ;</l>
     <l n="7451">Them , nothing : if they all things , who enclosed</l>
     <l n="7452">Knowledge of good and evil in this tree ,</l>
     <l n="7453">That whoso eats thereof , forthwith attains</l>
     <l n="7454">Wisdom without their leave ? and wherein lies</l>
     <l n="7455">The offence , that Man should thus attain to know ?</l>
     <l n="7456">What can your knowledge hurt him , or this tree</l>
     <l n="7457">Impart against his will , if all be his ?</l>
     <l n="7458">Or is it envy ? and can envy dwell</l>
     <l n="7459">In heavenly breasts ? These , these , and many more</l>
     <l n="7460">Causes import your need of this fair fruit .</l>
     <l n="7461">Goddess humane , reach then , and freely taste !</l>
     <l n="7462">He ended ; and his words , replete with guile ,</l>
     <l n="7463">Into her heart too easy entrance won :</l>
     <l n="7464">Fixed on the fruit she gazed , which to behold</l>
     <l n="7465">Might tempt alone ; and in her ears the sound</l>
     <l n="7466">Yet rung of his persuasive words , impregned</l>
     <l n="7467">With reason , to her seeming , and with truth :</l>
     <l n="7468">Mean while the hour of noon drew on , and waked</l>
     <l n="7469">An eager appetite , raised by the smell</l>
     <l n="7470">So savoury of that fruit , which with desire ,</l>
     <l n="7471">Inclinable now grown to touch or taste ,</l>
     <l n="7472">Solicited her longing eye ; yet first</l>
     <l n="7473">Pausing a while , thus to herself she mused .</l>
     <l n="7474">Great are thy virtues , doubtless , best of fruits ,</l>
     <l n="7475">Though kept from man , and worthy to be admired ;</l>
     <l n="7476">Whose taste , too long forborn , at first assay</l>
     <l n="7477">Gave elocution to the mute , and taught</l>
     <l n="7478">The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise :</l>
     <l n="7479">Thy praise he also , who forbids thy use ,</l>
     <l n="7480">Conceals not from us , naming thee the tree</l>
     <l n="7481">Of knowledge , knowledge both of good and evil ;</l>
     <l n="7482">Forbids us then to taste ! but his forbidding</l>
     <l n="7483">Commends thee more , while it infers the good</l>
     <l n="7484">By thee communicated , and our want :</l>
     <l n="7485">For good unknown sure is not had ; or , had</l>
     <l n="7486">And yet unknown , is as not had at all .</l>
     <l n="7487">In plain then , what forbids he but to know ,</l>
     <l n="7488">Forbids us good , forbids us to be wise ?</l>
     <l n="7489">Such prohibitions bind not . But , if death</l>
     <l n="7490">Bind us with after-bands , what profits then</l>
     <l n="7491">Our inward freedom ? In the day we eat</l>
     <l n="7492">Of this fair fruit , our doom is , we shall die !</l>
     <l n="7493">How dies the Serpent ? he hath eaten and lives ,</l>
     <l n="7494">And knows , and speaks , and reasons , and discerns ,</l>
     <l n="7495">Irrational till then . For us alone</l>
     <l n="7496">Was death invented ? or to us denied</l>
     <l n="7497">This intellectual food , for beasts reserved ?</l>
     <l n="7498">For beasts it seems : yet that one beast which first</l>
     <l n="7499">Hath tasted envies not , but brings with joy</l>
     <l n="7500">The good befallen him , author unsuspect ,</l>
     <l n="7501">Friendly to man , far from deceit or guile .</l>
     <l n="7502">What fear I then ? rather , what know to fear</l>
     <l n="7503">Under this ignorance of good and evil ,</l>
     <l n="7504">Of God or death , of law or penalty ?</l>
     <l n="7505">Here grows the cure of all , this fruit divine ,</l>
     <l n="7506">Fair to the eye , inviting to the taste ,</l>
     <l n="7507">Of virtue to make wise : What hinders then</l>
     <l n="7508">To reach , and feed at once both body and mind ?</l>
     <l n="7509">So saying , her rash hand in evil hour</l>
     <l n="7510">Forth reaching to the fruit , she plucked , she eat !</l>
     <l n="7511">Earth felt the wound ; and Nature from her seat ,</l>
     <l n="7512">Sighing through all her works , gave signs of woe ,</l>
     <l n="7513">That all was lost . Back to the thicket slunk</l>
     <l n="7514">The guilty Serpent ; and well might ; for Eve ,</l>
     <l n="7515">Intent now wholly on her taste , nought else</l>
     <l n="7516">Regarded ; such delight till then , as seemed ,</l>
     <l n="7517">In fruit she never tasted , whether true</l>
     <l n="7518">Or fancied so , through expectation high</l>
     <l n="7519">Of knowledge ; not was Godhead from her thought .</l>
     <l n="7520">Greedily she ingorged without restraint ,</l>
     <l n="7521">And knew not eating death : Satiate at length ,</l>
     <l n="7522">And hightened as with wine , jocund and boon ,</l>
     <l n="7523">Thus to herself she pleasingly began .</l>
     <l n="7524">O sovran , virtuous , precious of all trees</l>
     <l n="7525">In Paradise ! of operation blest</l>
     <l n="7526">To sapience , hitherto obscured , infamed .</l>
     <l n="7527">And thy fair fruit let hang , as to no end</l>
     <l n="7528">Created ; but henceforth my early care ,</l>
     <l n="7529">Not without song , each morning , and due praise ,</l>
     <l n="7530">Shall tend thee , and the fertile burden ease</l>
     <l n="7531">Of thy full branches offered free to all ;</l>
     <l n="7532">Till , dieted by thee , I grow mature</l>
     <l n="7533">In knowledge , as the Gods , who all things know ;</l>
     <l n="7534">Though others envy what they cannot give :</l>
     <l n="7535">For , had the gift been theirs , it had not here</l>
     <l n="7536">Thus grown . Experience , next , to thee I owe ,</l>
     <l n="7537">Best guide ; not following thee , I had remained</l>
     <l n="7538">In ignorance ; thou openest wisdom 's way ,</l>
     <l n="7539">And givest access , though secret she retire .</l>
     <l n="7540">And I perhaps am secret : Heaven is high ,</l>
     <l n="7541">High , and remote to see from thence distinct</l>
     <l n="7542">Each thing on Earth ; and other care perhaps</l>
     <l n="7543">May have diverted from continual watch</l>
     <l n="7544">Our great Forbidder , safe with all his spies</l>
     <l n="7545">About him . But to Adam in what sort</l>
     <l n="7546">Shall I appear ? shall I to him make known</l>
     <l n="7547">As yet my change , and give him to partake</l>
     <l n="7548">Full happiness with me , or rather not ,</l>
     <l n="7549">But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power</l>
     <l n="7550">Without copartner ? so to add what wants</l>
     <l n="7551">In female sex , the more to draw his love ,</l>
     <l n="7552">And render me more equal ; and perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="7553">A thing not undesirable , sometime</l>
     <l n="7554">Superiour ; for , inferiour , who is free</l>
     <l n="7555">This may be well : But what if God have seen ,</l>
     <l n="7556">And death ensue ? then I shall be no more !</l>
     <l n="7557">And Adam , wedded to another Eve ,</l>
     <l n="7558">Shall live with her enjoying , I extinct ;</l>
     <l n="7559">A death to think ! Confirmed then I resolve ,</l>
     <l n="7560">Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe :</l>
     <l n="7561">So dear I love him , that with him all deaths</l>
     <l n="7562">I could endure , without him live no life .</l>
     <l n="7563">So saying , from the tree her step she turned ;</l>
     <l n="7564">But first low reverence done , as to the Power</l>
     <l n="7565">That dwelt within , whose presence had infused</l>
     <l n="7566">Into the plant sciential sap , derived</l>
     <l n="7567">From nectar , drink of Gods . Adam the while ,</l>
     <l n="7568">Waiting desirous her return , had wove</l>
     <l n="7569">Of choicest flowers a garland , to adorn</l>
     <l n="7570">Her tresses , and her rural labours crown ;</l>
     <l n="7571">As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen .</l>
     <l n="7572">Great joy he promised to his thoughts , and new</l>
     <l n="7573">Solace in her return , so long delayed :</l>
     <l n="7574">Yet oft his heart , divine of something ill ,</l>
     <l n="7575">Misgave him ; he the faltering measure felt ;</l>
     <l n="7576">And forth to meet her went , the way she took</l>
     <l n="7577">That morn when first they parted : by the tree</l>
     <l n="7578">Of knowledge he must pass ; there he her met ,</l>
     <l n="7579">Scarce from the tree returning ; in her hand</l>
     <l n="7580">A bough of fairest fruit , that downy smiled ,</l>
     <l n="7581">New gathered , and ambrosial smell diffused .</l>
     <l n="7582">To him she hasted ; in her face excuse</l>
     <l n="7583">Came prologue , and apology too prompt ;</l>
     <l n="7584">Which , with bland words at will , she thus addressed .</l>
     <l n="7585">Hast thou not wondered , Adam , at my stay ?</l>
     <l n="7586">Thee I have missed , and thought it long , deprived</l>
     <l n="7587">Thy presence ; agony of love till now</l>
     <l n="7588">Not felt , nor shall be twice ; for never more</l>
     <l n="7589">Mean I to try , what rash untried I sought ,</l>
     <l n="7590">The pain of absence from thy sight . But strange</l>
     <l n="7591">Hath been the cause , and wonderful to hear :</l>
     <l n="7592">This tree is not , as we are told , a tree</l>
     <l n="7593">Of danger tasted , nor to evil unknown</l>
     <l n="7594">Opening the way , but of divine effect</l>
     <l n="7595">To open eyes , and make them Gods who taste ;</l>
     <l n="7596">And hath been tasted such : The serpent wise ,</l>
     <l n="7597">Or not restrained as we , or not obeying ,</l>
     <l n="7598">Hath eaten of the fruit ; and is become ,</l>
     <l n="7599">Not dead , as we are threatened , but thenceforth</l>
     <l n="7600">Endued with human voice and human sense ,</l>
     <l n="7601">Reasoning to admiration ; and with me</l>
     <l n="7602">Persuasively hath so prevailed , that I</l>
     <l n="7603">Have also tasted , and have also found</l>
     <l n="7604">The effects to correspond ; opener mine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="7605">Dim erst , dilated spirits , ampler heart ,</l>
     <l n="7606">And growing up to Godhead ; which for thee</l>
     <l n="7607">Chiefly I sought , without thee can despise .</l>
     <l n="7608">For bliss , as thou hast part , to me is bliss ;</l>
     <l n="7609">Tedious , unshared with thee , and odious soon .</l>
     <l n="7610">Thou therefore also taste , that equal lot</l>
     <l n="7611">May join us , equal joy , as equal love ;</l>
     <l n="7612">Lest , thou not tasting , different degree</l>
     <l n="7613">Disjoin us , and I then too late renounce</l>
     <l n="7614">Deity for thee , when Fate will not permit .</l>
     <l n="7615">Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told ;</l>
     <l n="7616">But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed .</l>
     <l n="7617">On the other side Adam , soon as he heard</l>
     <l n="7618">The fatal trespass done by Eve , amazed ,</l>
     <l n="7619">Astonied stood and blank , while horrour chill</l>
     <l n="7620">Ran through his veins , and all his joints relaxed ;</l>
     <l n="7621">From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve</l>
     <l n="7622">Down dropt , and all the faded roses shed :</l>
     <l n="7623">Speechless he stood and pale , till thus at length</l>
     <l n="7624">First to himself he inward silence broke .</l>
     <l n="7625">O fairest of Creation , last and best</l>
     <l n="7626">Of all God 's works , Creature in whom excelled</l>
     <l n="7627">Whatever can to sight or thought be formed ,</l>
     <l n="7628">Holy , divine , good , amiable , or sweet !</l>
     <l n="7629">How art thou lost ! how on a sudden lost ,</l>
     <l n="7630">Defaced , deflowered , and now to death devote !</l>
     <l n="7631">Rather , how hast thou yielded to transgress</l>
     <l n="7632">The strict forbiddance , how to violate</l>
     <l n="7633">The sacred fruit forbidden ! Some cursed fraud</l>
     <l n="7634">Of enemy hath beguiled thee , yet unknown ,</l>
     <l n="7635">And me with thee hath ruined ; for with thee</l>
     <l n="7636">Certain my resolution is to die :</l>
     <l n="7637">How can I live without thee ! how forego</l>
     <l n="7638">Thy sweet converse , and love so dearly joined ,</l>
     <l n="7639">To live again in these wild woods forlorn !</l>
     <l n="7640">Should God create another Eve , and I</l>
     <l n="7641">Another rib afford , yet loss of thee</l>
     <l n="7642">Would never from my heart : no , no ! I feel</l>
     <l n="7643">The link of Nature draw me : flesh of flesh ,</l>
     <l n="7644">Bone of my bone thou art , and from thy state</l>
     <l n="7645">Mine never shall be parted , bliss or woe .</l>
     <l n="7646">So having said , as one from sad dismay</l>
     <l n="7647">Recomforted , and after thoughts disturbed</l>
     <l n="7648">Submitting to what seemed remediless ,</l>
     <l n="7649">Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned .</l>
     <l n="7650">Bold deed thou hast presumed , adventurous Eve ,</l>
     <l n="7651">And peril great provoked , who thus hast dared ,</l>
     <l n="7652">Had it been only coveting to eye</l>
     <l n="7653">That sacred fruit , sacred to abstinence ,</l>
     <l n="7654">Much more to taste it under ban to touch .</l>
     <l n="7655">But past who can recall , or done undo ?</l>
     <l n="7656">Not God Omnipotent , nor Fate ; yet so</l>
     <l n="7657">Perhaps thou shalt not die , perhaps the fact</l>
     <l n="7658">Is not so heinous now , foretasted fruit ,</l>
     <l n="7659">Profaned first by the serpent , by him first</l>
     <l n="7660">Made common , and unhallowed , ere our taste ;</l>
     <l n="7661">Nor yet on him found deadly ; yet he lives ;</l>
     <l n="7662">Lives , as thou saidst , and gains to live , as Man ,</l>
     <l n="7663">Higher degree of life ; inducement strong</l>
     <l n="7664">To us , as likely tasting to attain</l>
     <l n="7665">Proportional ascent ; which cannot be</l>
     <l n="7666">But to be Gods , or Angels , demi-Gods .</l>
     <l n="7667">Nor can I think that God , Creator wise ,</l>
     <l n="7668">Though threatening , will in earnest so destroy</l>
     <l n="7669">Us his prime creatures , dignified so high ,</l>
     <l n="7670">Set over all his works ; which in our fall ,</l>
     <l n="7671">For us created , needs with us must fail ,</l>
     <l n="7672">Dependant made ; so God shall uncreate ,</l>
     <l n="7673">Be frustrate , do , undo , and labour lose ;</l>
     <l n="7674">Not well conceived of God , who , though his power</l>
     <l n="7675">Creation could repeat , yet would be loth</l>
     <l n="7676">Us to abolish , lest the Adversary</l>
     <l n="7677">Triumph , and say ; “ Fickle their state whom God</l>
     <l n="7678">Most favours ; who can please him long ? Me first</l>
     <l n="7679">He ruined , now Mankind ; whom will he next ? ”</l>
     <l n="7680">Matter of scorn , not to be given the Foe .</l>
     <l n="7681">However I with thee have fixed my lot ,</l>
     <l n="7682">Certain to undergo like doom : If death</l>
     <l n="7683">Consort with thee , death is to me as life ;</l>
     <l n="7684">So forcible within my heart I feel</l>
     <l n="7685">The bond of Nature draw me to my own ;</l>
     <l n="7686">My own in thee , for what thou art is mine ;</l>
     <l n="7687">Our state cannot be severed ; we are one ,</l>
     <l n="7688">One flesh ; to lose thee were to lose myself .</l>
     <l n="7689">So Adam ; and thus Eve to him replied .</l>
     <l n="7690">O glorious trial of exceeding love ,</l>
     <l n="7691">Illustrious evidence , example high !</l>
     <l n="7692">Engaging me to emulate ; but , short</l>
     <l n="7693">Of thy perfection , how shall I attain ,</l>
     <l n="7694">Adam , from whose dear side I boast me sprung ,</l>
     <l n="7695">And gladly of our union hear thee speak ,</l>
     <l n="7696">One heart , one soul in both ; whereof good proof</l>
     <l n="7697">This day affords , declaring thee resolved ,</l>
     <l n="7698">Rather than death , or aught than death more dread ,</l>
     <l n="7699">Shall separate us , linked in love so dear ,</l>
     <l n="7700">To undergo with me one guilt , one crime ,</l>
     <l n="7701">If any be , of tasting this fair fruit ;</l>
     <l n="7702">Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds ,</l>
     <l n="7703">Direct , or by occasion , hath presented</l>
     <l n="7704">This happy trial of thy love , which else</l>
     <l n="7705">So eminently never had been known ?</l>
     <l n="7706">Were it I thought death menaced would ensue</l>
     <l n="7707">This my attempt , I would sustain alone</l>
     <l n="7708">The worst , and not persuade thee , rather die</l>
     <l n="7709">Deserted , than oblige thee with a fact</l>
     <l n="7710">Pernicious to thy peace ; chiefly assured</l>
     <l n="7711">Remarkably so late of thy so true ,</l>
     <l n="7712">So faithful , love unequalled : but I feel</l>
     <l n="7713">Far otherwise the event ; not death , but life</l>
     <l n="7714">Augmented , opened eyes , new hopes , new joys ,</l>
     <l n="7715">Taste so divine , that what of sweet before</l>
     <l n="7716">Hath touched my sense , flat seems to this , and harsh .</l>
     <l n="7717">On my experience , Adam , freely taste ,</l>
     <l n="7718">And fear of death deliver to the winds .</l>
     <l n="7719">So saying , she embraced him , and for joy</l>
     <l n="7720">Tenderly wept ; much won , that he his love</l>
     <l n="7721">Had so ennobled , as of choice to incur</l>
     <l n="7722">Divine displeasure for her sake , or death .</l>
     <l n="7723">In recompence ( for such compliance bad</l>
     <l n="7724">Such recompence best merits ) from the bough</l>
     <l n="7725">She gave him of that fair enticing fruit</l>
     <l n="7726">With liberal hand : he scrupled not to eat ,</l>
     <l n="7727">Against his better knowledge ; not deceived ,</l>
     <l n="7728">But fondly overcome with female charm .</l>
     <l n="7729">Earth trembled from her entrails , as again</l>
     <l n="7730">In pangs ; and Nature gave a second groan ;</l>
     <l n="7731">Sky loured ; and , muttering thunder , some sad drops</l>
     <l n="7732">Wept at completing of the mortal sin</l>
     <l n="7733">Original : while Adam took no thought ,</l>
     <l n="7734">Eating his fill ; nor Eve to iterate</l>
     <l n="7735">Her former trespass feared , the more to sooth</l>
     <l n="7736">Him with her loved society ; that now ,</l>
     <l n="7737">As with new wine intoxicated both ,</l>
     <l n="7738">They swim in mirth , and fancy that they feel</l>
     <l n="7739">Divinity within them breeding wings ,</l>
     <l n="7740">Wherewith to scorn the earth : But that false fruit</l>
     <l n="7741">Far other operation first displayed ,</l>
     <l n="7742">Carnal desire inflaming ; he on Eve</l>
     <l n="7743">Began to cast lascivious eyes ; she him</l>
     <l n="7744">As wantonly repaid ; in lust they burn :</l>
     <l n="7745">Till Adam thus ‘ gan Eve to dalliance move .</l>
     <l n="7746">Eve , now I see thou art exact of taste ,</l>
     <l n="7747">And elegant , of sapience no small part ;</l>
     <l n="7748">Since to each meaning savour we apply ,</l>
     <l n="7749">And palate call judicious ; I the praise</l>
     <l n="7750">Yield thee , so well this day thou hast purveyed .</l>
     <l n="7751">Much pleasure we have lost , while we abstained</l>
     <l n="7752">From this delightful fruit , nor known till now</l>
     <l n="7753">True relish , tasting ; if such pleasure be</l>
     <l n="7754">In things to us forbidden , it might be wished ,</l>
     <l n="7755">For this one tree had been forbidden ten .</l>
     <l n="7756">But come , so well refreshed , now let us play ,</l>
     <l n="7757">As meet is , after such delicious fare ;</l>
     <l n="7758">For never did thy beauty , since the day</l>
     <l n="7759">I saw thee first and wedded thee , adorned</l>
     <l n="7760">With all perfections , so inflame my sense</l>
     <l n="7761">With ardour to enjoy thee , fairer now</l>
     <l n="7762">Than ever ; bounty of this virtuous tree !</l>
     <l n="7763">So said he , and forbore not glance or toy</l>
     <l n="7764">Of amorous intent ; well understood</l>
     <l n="7765">Of Eve , whose eye darted contagious fire .</l>
     <l n="7766">Her hand he seised ; and to a shady bank ,</l>
     <l n="7767">Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered ,</l>
     <l n="7768">He led her nothing loth ; flowers were the couch ,</l>
     <l n="7769">Pansies , and violets , and asphodel ,</l>
     <l n="7770">And hyacinth ; Earth 's freshest softest lap .</l>
     <l n="7771">There they their fill of love and love 's disport</l>
     <l n="7772">Took largely , of their mutual guilt the seal ,</l>
     <l n="7773">The solace of their sin ; till dewy sleep</l>
     <l n="7774">Oppressed them , wearied with their amorous play ,</l>
     <l n="7775">Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit ,</l>
     <l n="7776">That with exhilarating vapour bland</l>
     <l n="7777">About their spirits had played , and inmost powers</l>
     <l n="7778">Made err , was now exhaled ; and grosser sleep ,</l>
     <l n="7779">Bred of unkindly fumes , with conscious dreams</l>
     <l n="7780">Incumbered , now had left them ; up they rose</l>
     <l n="7781">As from unrest ; and , each the other viewing ,</l>
     <l n="7782">Soon found their eyes how opened , and their minds</l>
     <l n="7783">How darkened ; innocence , that as a veil</l>
     <l n="7784">Had shadowed them from knowing ill , was gone ;</l>
     <l n="7785">Just confidence , and native righteousness ,</l>
     <l n="7786">And honour , from about them , naked left</l>
     <l n="7787">To guilty Shame ; he covered , but his robe</l>
     <l n="7788">Uncovered more . So rose the Danite strong ,</l>
     <l n="7789">Herculean Samson , from the harlot-lap</l>
     <l n="7790">Of Philistean Dalilah , and waked</l>
     <l n="7791">Shorn of his strength . They destitute and bare</l>
     <l n="7792">Of all their virtue : Silent , and in face</l>
     <l n="7793">Confounded , long they sat , as strucken mute :</l>
     <l n="7794">Till Adam , though not less than Eve abashed ,</l>
     <l n="7795">At length gave utterance to these words constrained .</l>
     <l n="7796">O Eve , in evil hour thou didst give ear</l>
     <l n="7797">To that false worm , of whomsoever taught</l>
     <l n="7798">To counterfeit Man 's voice ; true in our fall ,</l>
     <l n="7799">False in our promised rising ; since our eyes</l>
     <l n="7800">Opened we find indeed , and find we know</l>
     <l n="7801">Both good and evil ; good lost , and evil got ;</l>
     <l n="7802">Bad fruit of knowledge , if this be to know ;</l>
     <l n="7803">Which leaves us naked thus , of honour void ,</l>
     <l n="7804">Of innocence , of faith , of purity ,</l>
     <l n="7805">Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained ,</l>
     <l n="7806">And in our faces evident the signs</l>
     <l n="7807">Of foul concupiscence ; whence evil store ;</l>
     <l n="7808">Even shame , the last of evils ; of the first</l>
     <l n="7809">Be sure then .— How shall I behold the face</l>
     <l n="7810">Henceforth of God or Angel , erst with joy</l>
     <l n="7811">And rapture so oft beheld ? Those heavenly shapes</l>
     <l n="7812">Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze</l>
     <l n="7813">Insufferably bright . O ! might I here</l>
     <l n="7814">In solitude live savage ; in some glade</l>
     <l n="7815">Obscured , where highest woods , impenetrable</l>
     <l n="7816">To star or sun-light , spread their umbrage broad</l>
     <l n="7817">And brown as evening : Cover me , ye Pines !</l>
     <l n="7818">Ye Cedars , with innumerable boughs</l>
     <l n="7819">Hide me , where I may never see them more !—</l>
     <l n="7820">But let us now , as in bad plight , devise</l>
     <l n="7821">What best may for the present serve to hide</l>
     <l n="7822">The parts of each from other , that seem most</l>
     <l n="7823">To shame obnoxious , and unseemliest seen ;</l>
     <l n="7824">Some tree , whose broad smooth leaves together sewed ,</l>
     <l n="7825">And girded on our loins , may cover round</l>
     <l n="7826">Those middle parts ; that this new comer , Shame ,</l>
     <l n="7827">There sit not , and reproach us as unclean .</l>
     <l n="7828">So counselled he , and both together went</l>
     <l n="7829">Into the thickest wood ; there soon they chose</l>
     <l n="7830">The fig-tree ; not that kind for fruit renowned ,</l>
     <l n="7831">But such as at this day , to Indians known ,</l>
     <l n="7832">In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms</l>
     <l n="7833">Branching so broad and long , that in the ground</l>
     <l n="7834">The bended twigs take root , and daughters grow</l>
     <l n="7835">About the mother tree , a pillared shade</l>
     <l n="7836">High over-arched , and echoing walks between :</l>
     <l n="7837">There oft the Indian herdsman , shunning heat ,</l>
     <l n="7838">Shelters in cool , and tends his pasturing herds</l>
     <l n="7839">At loop-holes cut through thickest shade : Those leaves</l>
     <l n="7840">They gathered , broad as Amazonian targe ;</l>
     <l n="7841">And , with what skill they had , together sewed ,</l>
     <l n="7842">To gird their waist ; vain covering , if to hide</l>
     <l n="7843">Their guilt and dreaded shame ! O , how unlike</l>
     <l n="7844">To that first naked glory ! Such of late</l>
     <l n="7845">Columbus found the American , so girt</l>
     <l n="7846">With feathered cincture ; naked else , and wild</l>
     <l n="7847">Among the trees on isles and woody shores .</l>
     <l n="7848">Thus fenced , and , as they thought , their shame in part</l>
     <l n="7849">Covered , but not at rest or ease of mind ,</l>
     <l n="7850">They sat them down to weep ; nor only tears</l>
     <l n="7851">Rained at their eyes , but high winds worse within</l>
     <l n="7852">Began to rise , high passions , anger , hate ,</l>
     <l n="7853">Mistrust , suspicion , discord ; and shook sore</l>
     <l n="7854">Their inward state of mind , calm region once</l>
     <l n="7855">And full of peace , now tost and turbulent :</l>
     <l n="7856">For Understanding ruled not , and the Will</l>
     <l n="7857">Heard not her lore ; both in subjection now</l>
     <l n="7858">To sensual Appetite , who from beneath</l>
     <l n="7859">Usurping over sovran Reason claimed</l>
     <l n="7860">Superiour sway : From thus distempered breast ,</l>
     <l n="7861">Adam , estranged in look and altered style ,</l>
     <l n="7862">Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed .</l>
     <l n="7863">Would thou hadst hearkened to my words , and staid</l>
     <l n="7864">With me , as I besought thee , when that strange</l>
     <l n="7865">Desire of wandering , this unhappy morn ,</l>
     <l n="7866">I know not whence possessed thee ; we had then</l>
     <l n="7867">Remained still happy ; not , as now , despoiled</l>
     <l n="7868">Of all our good ; shamed , naked , miserable !</l>
     <l n="7869">Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve</l>
     <l n="7870">The faith they owe ; when earnestly they seek</l>
     <l n="7871">Such proof , conclude , they then begin to fail .</l>
     <l n="7872">To whom , soon moved with touch of blame , thus Eve .</l>
     <l n="7873">What words have passed thy lips , Adam severe !</l>
     <l n="7874">Imputest thou that to my default , or will</l>
     <l n="7875">Of wandering , as thou callest it , which who knows</l>
     <l n="7876">But might as ill have happened thou being by ,</l>
     <l n="7877">Or to thyself perhaps ? Hadst thou been there ,</l>
     <l n="7878">Or here the attempt , thou couldst not have discerned</l>
     <l n="7879">Fraud in the Serpent , speaking as he spake ;</l>
     <l n="7880">No ground of enmity between us known ,</l>
     <l n="7881">Why he should mean me ill , or seek to harm .</l>
     <l n="7882">Was I to have never parted from thy side ?</l>
     <l n="7883">As good have grown there still a lifeless rib .</l>
     <l n="7884">Being as I am , why didst not thou , the head ,</l>
     <l n="7885">Command me absolutely not to go ,</l>
     <l n="7886">Going into such danger , as thou saidst ?</l>
     <l n="7887">Too facile then , thou didst not much gainsay ;</l>
     <l n="7888">Nay , didst permit , approve , and fair dismiss .</l>
     <l n="7889">Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent ,</l>
     <l n="7890">Neither had I transgressed , nor thou with me .</l>
     <l n="7891">To whom , then first incensed , Adam replied .</l>
     <l n="7892">Is this the love , is this the recompence</l>
     <l n="7893">Of mine to thee , ingrateful Eve ! expressed</l>
     <l n="7894">Immutable , when thou wert lost , not I ;</l>
     <l n="7895">Who might have lived , and joyed immortal bliss ,</l>
     <l n="7896">Yet willingly chose rather death with thee ?</l>
     <l n="7897">And am I now upbraided as the cause</l>

     <l n="7899">It seems , in thy restraint : What could I more</l>
     <l n="7900">I warned thee , I admonished thee , foretold</l>
     <l n="7901">The danger , and the lurking enemy</l>
     <l n="7902">That lay in wait ; beyond this , had been force ;</l>
     <l n="7903">And force upon free will hath here no place .</l>
     <l n="7904">But confidence then bore thee on ; secure</l>
     <l n="7905">Either to meet no danger , or to find</l>
     <l n="7906">Matter of glorious trial ; and perhaps</l>
     <l n="7907">I also erred , in overmuch admiring</l>
     <l n="7908">What seemed in thee so perfect , that I thought</l>
     <l n="7909">No evil durst attempt thee ; but I rue</l>
     <l n="7910">The errour now , which is become my crime ,</l>
     <l n="7911">And thou the accuser . Thus it shall befall</l>
     <l n="7912">Him , who , to worth in women overtrusting ,</l>
     <l n="7913">Lets her will rule : restraint she will not brook ;</l>
     <l n="7914">And , left to herself , if evil thence ensue ,</l>
     <l n="7915">She first his weak indulgence will accuse .</l>
     <l n="7916">Thus they in mutual accusation spent</l>
     <l n="7917">The fruitless hours , but neither self-condemning ;</l>
     <l n="7918">And of their vain contest appeared no end .</l>

     <l n="7920">Mean while the heinous and despiteful act</l>
     <l n="7921">Of Satan , done in Paradise ; and how</l>
     <l n="7922">He , in the serpent , had perverted Eve ,</l>
     <l n="7923">Her husband she , to taste the fatal fruit ,</l>

     <l n="7936">Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste</l>
     <l n="7937">The angelick guards ascended , mute , and sad ,</l>
     <l n="7938">For Man ; for of his state by this they knew ,</l>
     <l n="7939">Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen</l>
     <l n="7940">Entrance unseen . Soon as the unwelcome news</l>
     <l n="7941">From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate , displeased</l>
     <l n="7942">All were who heard ; dim sadness did not spare</l>
     <l n="7943">That time celestial visages , yet , mixed</l>
     <l n="7944">With pity , violated not their bliss .</l>
     <l n="7945">About the new-arrived , in multitudes</l>
     <l n="7946">The ethereal people ran , to hear and know</l>
     <l n="7947">How all befel : They towards the throne supreme ,</l>
     <l n="7948">Accountable , made haste , to make appear ,</l>
     <l n="7949">With righteous plea , their utmost vigilance</l>
     <l n="7950">And easily approved ; when the Most High</l>
     <l n="7951">Eternal Father , from his secret cloud ,</l>
     <l n="7952">Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice .</l>
     <l n="7953">Assembled Angels , and ye Powers returned</l>
     <l n="7954">From unsuccessful charge ; be not dismayed ,</l>
     <l n="7955">Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth ,</l>
     <l n="7956">Which your sincerest care could not prevent ;</l>
     <l n="7957">Foretold so lately what would come to pass ,</l>
     <l n="7958">When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell .</l>
     <l n="7959">I told ye then he should prevail , and speed</l>
     <l n="7960">On his bad errand ; Man should be seduced ,</l>
     <l n="7961">And flattered out of all , believing lies</l>
     <l n="7962">Against his Maker ; no decree of mine</l>
     <l n="7963">Concurring to necessitate his fall ,</l>
     <l n="7964">Or touch with lightest moment of impulse</l>
     <l n="7965">His free will , to her own inclining left</l>
     <l n="7966">In even scale . But fallen he is ; and now</l>
     <l n="7967">What rests , but that the mortal sentence pass</l>
     <l n="7968">On his transgression ,— death denounced that day ?</l>
     <l n="7969">Which he presumes already vain and void ,</l>
     <l n="7970">Because not yet inflicted , as he feared ,</l>
     <l n="7971">By some immediate stroke ; but soon shall find</l>
     <l n="7972">Forbearance no acquittance , ere day end .</l>
     <l n="7973">Justice shall not return as bounty scorned .</l>
     <l n="7974">But whom send I to judge them ? whom but thee ,</l>
     <l n="7975">Vicegerent Son ? To thee I have transferred</l>
     <l n="7976">All judgement , whether in Heaven , or Earth , or Hell .</l>
     <l n="7977">Easy it may be seen that I intend</l>
     <l n="7978">Mercy colleague with justice , sending thee</l>
     <l n="7979">Man 's friend , his Mediator , his designed</l>
     <l n="7980">Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary ,</l>
     <l n="7981">And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen .</l>
     <l n="7982">So spake the Father ; and , unfolding bright</l>
     <l n="7983">Toward the right hand his glory , on the Son</l>
     <l n="7984">Blazed forth unclouded Deity : He full</l>
     <l n="7985">Resplendent all his Father manifest</l>
     <l n="7986">Expressed , and thus divinely answered mild .</l>
     <l n="7987">Father Eternal , thine is to decree ;</l>
     <l n="7988">Mine , both in Heaven and Earth , to do thy will</l>
     <l n="7989">Supreme ; that thou in me , thy Son beloved ,</l>
     <l n="7990">Mayest ever rest well pleased . I go to judge</l>
     <l n="7991">On earth these thy transgressours ; but thou knowest ,</l>
     <l n="7992">Whoever judged , the worst on me must light ,</l>
     <l n="7993">When time shall be ; for so I undertook</l>
     <l n="7994">Before thee ; and , not repenting , this obtain</l>
     <l n="7995">Of right , that I may mitigate their doom</l>
     <l n="7996">On me derived ; yet I shall temper so</l>
     <l n="7997">Justice with mercy , as may illustrate most</l>
     <l n="7998">Them fully satisfied , and thee appease .</l>
     <l n="7999">Attendance none shall need , nor train , where none</l>
     <l n="8000">Are to behold the judgement , but the judged ,</l>
     <l n="8001">Those two ; the third best absent is condemned ,</l>
     <l n="8002">Convict by flight , and rebel to all law :</l>
     <l n="8003">Conviction to the serpent none belongs .</l>
     <l n="8004">Thus saying , from his radiant seat he rose</l>
     <l n="8005">Of high collateral glory : Him Thrones , and Powers ,</l>
     <l n="8006">Princedoms , and Dominations ministrant ,</l>
     <l n="8007">Accompanied to Heaven-gate ; from whence</l>
     <l n="8008">Eden , and all the coast , in prospect lay .</l>
     <l n="8009">Down he descended straight ; the speed of Gods</l>
     <l n="8010">Time counts not , though with swiftest minutes winged .</l>
     <l n="8011">Now was the sun in western cadence low</l>
     <l n="8012">From noon , and gentle airs , due at their hour ,</l>
     <l n="8013">To fan the earth now waked , and usher in</l>
     <l n="8014">The evening cool ; when he , from wrath more cool ,</l>
     <l n="8015">Came the mild Judge , and Intercessour both ,</l>
     <l n="8016">To sentence Man : The voice of God they heard</l>
     <l n="8017">Now walking in the garden , by soft winds</l>
     <l n="8018">Brought to their ears , while day declined ; they heard ,</l>
     <l n="8019">And from his presence hid themselves among</l>
     <l n="8020">The thickest trees , both man and wife ; till God ,</l>
     <l n="8021">Approaching , thus to Adam called aloud .</l>
     <l n="8022">Where art thou , Adam , wont with joy to meet</l>
     <l n="8023">My coming seen far off ? I miss thee here ,</l>
     <l n="8024">Not pleased , thus entertained with solitude ,</l>
     <l n="8025">Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought :</l>
     <l n="8026">Or come I less conspicuous , or what change</l>
     <l n="8027">Absents thee , or what chance detains ?— Come forth !</l>
     <l n="8028">He came ; and with him Eve , more loth , though first</l>
     <l n="8029">To offend ; discountenanced both , and discomposed ;</l>
     <l n="8030">Love was not in their looks , either to God ,</l>
     <l n="8031">Or to each other ; but apparent guilt ,</l>
     <l n="8032">And shame , and perturbation , and despair ,</l>
     <l n="8033">Anger , and obstinacy , and hate , and guile .</l>
     <l n="8034">Whence Adam , faltering long , thus answered brief .</l>
     <l n="8035">I heard thee in the garden , and of thy voice</l>
     <l n="8036">Afraid , being naked , hid myself . To whom</l>
     <l n="8037">The gracious Judge without revile replied .</l>
     <l n="8038">My voice thou oft hast heard , and hast not feared ,</l>
     <l n="8039">But still rejoiced ; how is it now become</l>
     <l n="8040">So dreadful to thee ? That thou art naked , who</l>
     <l n="8041">Hath told thee ? Hast thou eaten of the tree ,</l>
     <l n="8042">Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat ?</l>
     <l n="8043">To whom thus Adam sore beset replied .</l>
     <l n="8044">O Heaven ! in evil strait this day I stand</l>
     <l n="8045">Before my Judge ; either to undergo</l>
     <l n="8046">Myself the total crime , or to accuse</l>
     <l n="8047">My other self , the partner of my life ;</l>
     <l n="8048">Whose failing , while her faith to me remains ,</l>
     <l n="8049">I should conceal , and not expose to blame</l>
     <l n="8050">By my complaint : but strict necessity</l>
     <l n="8051">Subdues me , and calamitous constraint ;</l>
     <l n="8052">Lest on my head both sin and punishment ,</l>
     <l n="8053">However insupportable , be all</l>
     <l n="8054">Devolved ; though should I hold my peace , yet thou</l>
     <l n="8055">Wouldst easily detect what I conceal .—</l>
     <l n="8056">This Woman , whom thou madest to be my help ,</l>
     <l n="8057">And gavest me as thy perfect gift , so good ,</l>
     <l n="8058">So fit , so acceptable , so divine ,</l>
     <l n="8059">That from her hand I could suspect no ill ,</l>
     <l n="8060">And what she did , whatever in itself ,</l>
     <l n="8061">Her doing seemed to justify the deed ;</l>
     <l n="8062">She gave me of the tree , and I did eat .</l>
     <l n="8063">To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied .</l>
     <l n="8064">Was she thy God , that her thou didst obey</l>
     <l n="8065">Before his voice ? or was she made thy guide ,</l>
     <l n="8066">Superiour , or but equal , that to her</l>
     <l n="8067">Thou didst resign thy manhood , and the place</l>
     <l n="8068">Wherein God set thee above her made of thee ,</l>
     <l n="8069">And for thee , whose perfection far excelled</l>
     <l n="8070">Hers in all real dignity ? Adorned</l>
     <l n="8071">She was indeed , and lovely , to attract</l>
     <l n="8072">Thy love , not thy subjection ; and her gifts</l>
     <l n="8073">Were such , as under government well seemed ;</l>
     <l n="8074">Unseemly to bear rule ; which was thy part</l>
     <l n="8075">And person , hadst thou known thyself aright .</l>
     <l n="8076">So having said , he thus to Eve in few .</l>
     <l n="8077">Say , Woman , what is this which thou hast done ?</l>
     <l n="8078">To whom sad Eve , with shame nigh overwhelmed ,</l>
     <l n="8079">Confessing soon , yet not before her Judge</l>
     <l n="8080">Bold or loquacious , thus abashed replied .</l>
     <l n="8081">The Serpent me beguiled , and I did eat .</l>
     <l n="8082">Which when the Lord God heard , without delay</l>
     <l n="8083">To judgement he proceeded on the accused</l>
     <l n="8084">Serpent , though brute ; unable to transfer</l>
     <l n="8085">The guilt on him , who made him instrument</l>
     <l n="8086">Of mischief , and polluted from the end</l>
     <l n="8087">Of his creation ; justly then accursed ,</l>
     <l n="8088">As vitiated in nature : More to know</l>
     <l n="8089">Concerned not Man , ( since he no further knew )</l>
     <l n="8090">Nor altered his offence ; yet God at last</l>
     <l n="8091">To Satan first in sin his doom applied ,</l>
     <l n="8092">Though in mysterious terms , judged as then best :</l>
     <l n="8093">And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall .</l>
     <l n="8094">Because thou hast done this , thou art accursed</l>
     <l n="8095">Above all cattle , each beast of the field ;</l>
     <l n="8096">Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go ,</l>
     <l n="8097">And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life .</l>
     <l n="8098">Between thee and the woman I will put</l>
     <l n="8099">Enmity , and between thine and her seed ;</l>
     <l n="8100">Her seed shall bruise thy head , thou bruise his heel .</l>
     <l n="8101">So spake this oracle , then verified</l>
     <l n="8102">When Jesus , Son of Mary , second Eve ,</l>
     <l n="8103">Saw Satan fall , like lightning , down from Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="8104">Prince of the air ; then , rising from his grave</l>
     <l n="8105">Spoiled Principalities and Powers , triumphed</l>
     <l n="8106">In open show ; and , with ascension bright ,</l>
     <l n="8107">Captivity led captive through the air ,</l>
     <l n="8108">The realm itself of Satan , long usurped ;</l>
     <l n="8109">Whom he shall tread at last under our feet ;</l>
     <l n="8110">Even he , who now foretold his fatal bruise ;</l>
     <l n="8111">And to the Woman thus his sentence turned .</l>
     <l n="8112">Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply</l>
     <l n="8113">By thy conception ; children thou shalt bring</l>
     <l n="8114">In sorrow forth ; and to thy husband 's will</l>
     <l n="8115">Thine shall submit ; he over thee shall rule .</l>
     <l n="8116">On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced .</l>
     <l n="8117">Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife ,</l>
     <l n="8118">And eaten of the tree , concerning which</l>
     <l n="8119">I charged thee , saying , Thou shalt not eat thereof :</l>
     <l n="8120">Cursed is the ground for thy sake ; thou in sorrow</l>
     <l n="8121">Shalt eat thereof , all the days of thy life ;</l>
     <l n="8122">Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth</l>
     <l n="8123">Unbid ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;</l>
     <l n="8124">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread ,</l>
     <l n="8125">Till thou return unto the ground ; for thou</l>
     <l n="8126">Out of the ground wast taken , know thy birth ,</l>
     <l n="8127">For dust thou art , and shalt to dust return .</l>
     <l n="8128">So judged he Man , both Judge and Saviour sent ;</l>
     <l n="8129">And the instant stroke of death , denounced that day ,</l>
     <l n="8130">Removed far off ; then , pitying how they stood</l>
     <l n="8131">Before him naked to the air , that now</l>
     <l n="8132">Must suffer change , disdained not to begin</l>
     <l n="8133">Thenceforth the form of servant to assume ;</l>
     <l n="8134">As when he washed his servants feet ; so now ,</l>
     <l n="8135">As father of his family , he clad</l>
     <l n="8136">Their nakedness with skins of beasts , or slain ,</l>
     <l n="8137">Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid ;</l>
     <l n="8138">And thought not much to clothe his enemies ;</l>
     <l n="8139">Nor he their outward only with the skins</l>
     <l n="8140">Of beasts , but inward nakedness , much more .</l>
     <l n="8141">Opprobrious , with his robe of righteousness ,</l>
     <l n="8142">Arraying , covered from his Father 's sight .</l>
     <l n="8143">To him with swift ascent he up returned ,</l>
     <l n="8144">Into his blissful bosom reassumed</l>
     <l n="8145">In glory , as of old ; to him appeased</l>
     <l n="8146">All , though all-knowing , what had passed with Man</l>
     <l n="8147">Recounted , mixing intercession sweet .</l>
     <l n="8148">Mean while , ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth ,</l>
     <l n="8149">Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death ,</l>
     <l n="8150">In counterview within the gates , that now</l>
     <l n="8151">Stood open wide , belching outrageous flame</l>
     <l n="8152">Far into Chaos , since the Fiend passed through ,</l>
     <l n="8153">Sin opening ; who thus now to Death began .</l>
     <l n="8154">O Son , why sit we here each other viewing</l>
     <l n="8155">Idly , while Satan , our great author , thrives</l>
     <l n="8156">In other worlds , and happier seat provides</l>
     <l n="8157">For us , his offspring dear ? It cannot be</l>
     <l n="8158">But that success attends him ; if mishap ,</l>
     <l n="8159">Ere this he had returned , with fury driven</l>
     <l n="8160">By his avengers ; since no place like this</l>
     <l n="8161">Can fit his punishment , or their revenge .</l>
     <l n="8162">Methinks I feel new strength within me rise ,</l>
     <l n="8163">Wings growing , and dominion given me large</l>
     <l n="8164">Beyond this deep ; whatever draws me on ,</l>
     <l n="8165">Or sympathy , or some connatural force ,</l>
     <l n="8166">Powerful at greatest distance to unite ,</l>
     <l n="8167">With secret amity , things of like kind ,</l>
     <l n="8168">By secretest conveyance . Thou , my shade</l>
     <l n="8169">Inseparable , must with me along ;</l>
     <l n="8170">For Death from Sin no power can separate .</l>
     <l n="8171">But , lest the difficulty of passing back</l>
     <l n="8172">Stay his return perhaps over this gulf</l>
     <l n="8173">Impassable , impervious ; let us try</l>
     <l n="8174">Adventurous work , yet to thy power and mine</l>
     <l n="8175">Not unagreeable , to found a path</l>
     <l n="8176">Over this main from Hell to that new world ,</l>
     <l n="8177">Where Satan now prevails ; a monument</l>
     <l n="8178">Of merit high to all the infernal host ,</l>
     <l n="8179">Easing their passage hence , for intercourse ,</l>
     <l n="8180">Or transmigration , as their lot shall lead .</l>
     <l n="8181">Nor can I miss the way , so strongly drawn</l>
     <l n="8182">By this new-felt attraction and instinct .</l>
     <l n="8183">Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon .</l>
     <l n="8184">Go , whither Fate , and inclination strong ,</l>
     <l n="8185">Leads thee ; I shall not lag behind , nor err</l>
     <l n="8186">The way , thou leading ; such a scent I draw</l>
     <l n="8187">Of carnage , prey innumerable , and taste</l>
     <l n="8188">The savour of death from all things there that live :</l>
     <l n="8189">Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest</l>
     <l n="8190">Be wanting , but afford thee equal aid .</l>
     <l n="8191">So saying , with delight he snuffed the smell</l>
     <l n="8192">Of mortal change on earth . As when a flock</l>
     <l n="8193">Of ravenous fowl , though many a league remote ,</l>
     <l n="8194">Against the day of battle , to a field ,</l>
     <l n="8195">Where armies lie encamped , come flying , lured</l>
     <l n="8196">With scent of living carcasses designed</l>
     <l n="8197">For death , the following day , in bloody fight :</l>
     <l n="8198">So scented the grim Feature , and upturned</l>
     <l n="8199">His nostril wide into the murky air ;</l>
     <l n="8200">Sagacious of his quarry from so far .</l>
     <l n="8201">Then both from out Hell-gates , into the waste</l>
     <l n="8202">Wide anarchy of Chaos , damp and dark ,</l>
     <l n="8203">Flew diverse ; and with power ( their power was great )</l>
     <l n="8204">Hovering upon the waters , what they met</l>
     <l n="8205">Solid or slimy , as in raging sea</l>
     <l n="8206">Tost up and down , together crouded drove ,</l>
     <l n="8207">From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell ;</l>
     <l n="8208">As when two polar winds , blowing adverse</l>
     <l n="8209">Upon the Cronian sea , together drive</l>
     <l n="8210">Mountains of ice , that stop the imagined way</l>
     <l n="8211">Beyond Petsora eastward , to the rich</l>
     <l n="8212">Cathaian coast . The aggregated soil</l>
     <l n="8213">Death with his mace petrifick , cold and dry ,</l>
     <l n="8214">As with a trident , smote ; and fixed as firm</l>
     <l n="8215">As Delos , floating once ; the rest his look</l>
     <l n="8216">Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move ;</l>
     <l n="8217">And with Asphaltick slime , broad as the gate ,</l>
     <l n="8218">Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach</l>
     <l n="8219">They fastened , and the mole immense wrought on</l>
     <l n="8220">Over the foaming deep high-arched , a bridge</l>
     <l n="8221">Of length prodigious , joining to the wall</l>
     <l n="8222">Immoveable of this now fenceless world ,</l>
     <l n="8223">Forfeit to Death ; from hence a passage broad ,</l>
     <l n="8224">Smooth , easy , inoffensive , down to Hell .</l>
     <l n="8225">So , if great things to small may be compared ,</l>
     <l n="8226">Xerxes , the liberty of Greece to yoke ,</l>
     <l n="8227">From Susa , his Memnonian palace high ,</l>
     <l n="8228">Came to the sea : and , over Hellespont</l>
     <l n="8229">Bridging his way , Europe with Asia joined ,</l>
     <l n="8230">And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves .</l>
     <l n="8231">Now had they brought the work by wonderous art</l>
     <l n="8232">Pontifical , a ridge of pendant rock ,</l>
     <l n="8233">Over the vexed abyss , following the track</l>
     <l n="8234">Of Satan to the self-same place where he</l>
     <l n="8235">First lighted from his wing , and landed safe</l>
     <l n="8236">From out of Chaos , to the outside bare</l>
     <l n="8237">Of this round world : With pins of adamant</l>
     <l n="8238">And chains they made all fast , too fast they made</l>
     <l n="8239">And durable ! And now in little space</l>
     <l n="8240">The confines met of empyrean Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="8241">And of this World ; and , on the left hand , Hell</l>
     <l n="8242">With long reach interposed ; three several ways</l>
     <l n="8243">In sight , to each of these three places led .</l>
     <l n="8244">And now their way to Earth they had descried ,</l>
     <l n="8245">To Paradise first tending ; when , behold !</l>
     <l n="8246">Satan , in likeness of an Angel bright ,</l>
     <l n="8247">Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering</l>
     <l n="8248">His zenith , while the sun in Aries rose :</l>
     <l n="8249">Disguised he came ; but those his children dear</l>
     <l n="8250">Their parent soon discerned , though in disguise .</l>
     <l n="8251">He , after Eve seduced , unminded slunk</l>
     <l n="8252">Into the wood fast by ; and , changing shape ,</l>
     <l n="8253">To observe the sequel , saw his guileful act</l>
     <l n="8254">By Eve , though all unweeting , seconded</l>
     <l n="8255">Upon her husband ; saw their shame that sought</l>
     <l n="8256">Vain covertures ; but when he saw descend</l>
     <l n="8257">The Son of God to judge them , terrified</l>
     <l n="8258">He fled ; not hoping to escape , but shun</l>
     <l n="8259">The present ; fearing , guilty , what his wrath</l>
     <l n="8260">Might suddenly inflict ; that past , returned</l>
     <l n="8261">By night , and listening where the hapless pair</l>
     <l n="8262">Sat in their sad discourse , and various plaint ,</l>
     <l n="8263">Thence gathered his own doom ; which understood</l>
     <l n="8264">Not instant , but of future time , with joy</l>
     <l n="8265">And tidings fraught , to Hell he now returned ;</l>
     <l n="8266">And at the brink of Chaos , near the foot</l>
     <l n="8267">Of this new wonderous pontifice , unhoped</l>
     <l n="8268">Met , who to meet him came , his offspring dear .</l>
     <l n="8269">Great joy was at their meeting , and at sight</l>
     <l n="8270">Of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased .</l>
     <l n="8271">Long he admiring stood , till Sin , his fair</l>
     <l n="8272">Enchanting daughter , thus the silence broke .</l>
     <l n="8273">O Parent , these are thy magnifick deeds ,</l>
     <l n="8274">Thy trophies ! which thou viewest as not thine own ;</l>
     <l n="8275">Thou art their author , and prime architect :</l>
     <l n="8276">For I no sooner in my heart divined ,</l>
     <l n="8277">My heart , which by a secret harmony</l>
     <l n="8278">Still moves with thine , joined in connexion sweet ,</l>
     <l n="8279">That thou on earth hadst prospered , which thy looks</l>
     <l n="8280">Now also evidence , but straight I felt ,</l>
     <l n="8281">Though distant from thee worlds between , yet felt ,</l>
     <l n="8282">That I must after thee , with this thy son ;</l>
     <l n="8283">Such fatal consequence unites us three !</l>
     <l n="8284">Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds ,</l>
     <l n="8285">Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure</l>
     <l n="8286">Detain from following thy illustrious track .</l>
     <l n="8287">Thou hast achieved our liberty , confined</l>
     <l n="8288">Within Hell-gates till now ; thou us impowered</l>
     <l n="8289">To fortify thus far , and overlay ,</l>
     <l n="8290">With this portentous bridge , the dark abyss .</l>
     <l n="8291">Thine now is all this world ; thy virtue hath won</l>
     <l n="8292">What thy hands builded not ; thy wisdom gained</l>
     <l n="8293">With odds what war hath lost , and fully avenged</l>
     <l n="8294">Our foil in Heaven ; here thou shalt monarch reign ,</l>
     <l n="8295">There didst not ; there let him still victor sway ,</l>
     <l n="8296">As battle hath adjudged ; from this new world</l>
     <l n="8297">Retiring , by his own doom alienated ;</l>
     <l n="8298">And henceforth monarchy with thee divide</l>
     <l n="8299">Of all things , parted by the empyreal bounds ,</l>
     <l n="8300">His quadrature , from thy orbicular world ;</l>
     <l n="8301">Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne .</l>
     <l n="8302">Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad .</l>
     <l n="8303">Fair Daughter , and thou Son and Grandchild both ;</l>
     <l n="8304">High proof ye now have given to be the race</l>
     <l n="8305">Of Satan ( for I glory in the name ,</l>
     <l n="8306">Antagonist of Heaven 's Almighty King ,)</l>
     <l n="8307">Amply have merited of me , of all</l>
     <l n="8308">The infernal empire , that so near Heaven 's door</l>
     <l n="8309">Triumphal with triumphal act have met ,</l>
     <l n="8310">Mine , with this glorious work ; and made one realm ,</l>
     <l n="8311">Hell and this world , one realm , one continent</l>
     <l n="8312">Of easy thorough-fare . Therefore , while I</l>
     <l n="8313">Descend through darkness , on your road with ease ,</l>
     <l n="8314">To my associate Powers , them to acquaint</l>
     <l n="8315">With these successes , and with them rejoice ;</l>
     <l n="8316">You two this way , among these numerous orbs ,</l>
     <l n="8317">All yours , right down to Paradise descend ;</l>
     <l n="8318">There dwell , and reign in bliss ; thence on the earth</l>
     <l n="8319">Dominion exercise and in the air ,</l>
     <l n="8320">Chiefly on Man , sole lord of all declared ;</l>
     <l n="8321">Him first make sure your thrall , and lastly kill .</l>
     <l n="8322">My substitutes I send ye , and create</l>
     <l n="8323">Plenipotent on earth , of matchless might</l>
     <l n="8324">Issuing from me : on your joint vigour now</l>
     <l n="8325">My hold of this new kingdom all depends ,</l>
     <l n="8326">Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit .</l>
     <l n="8327">If your joint power prevail , the affairs of Hell</l>
     <l n="8328">No detriment need fear ; go , and be strong !</l>
     <l n="8329">So saying he dismissed them ; they with speed</l>
     <l n="8330">Their course through thickest constellations held ,</l>
     <l n="8331">Spreading their bane ; the blasted stars looked wan ,</l>
     <l n="8332">And planets , planet-struck , real eclipse</l>
     <l n="8333">Then suffered . The other way Satan went down</l>
     <l n="8334">The causey to Hell-gate : On either side</l>
     <l n="8335">Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed ,</l>
     <l n="8336">And with rebounding surge the bars assailed ,</l>
     <l n="8337">That scorned his indignation : Through the gate ,</l>
     <l n="8338">Wide open and unguarded , Satan passed ,</l>
     <l n="8339">And all about found desolate ; for those ,</l>
     <l n="8340">Appointed to sit there , had left their charge ,</l>
     <l n="8341">Flown to the upper world ; the rest were all</l>
     <l n="8342">Far to the inland retired , about the walls</l>
     <l n="8343">Of Pandemonium ; city and proud seat</l>
     <l n="8344">Of Lucifer , so by allusion called</l>
     <l n="8345">Of that bright star to Satan paragoned ;</l>
     <l n="8346">There kept their watch the legions , while the Grand</l>
     <l n="8347">In council sat , solicitous what chance</l>
     <l n="8348">Might intercept their emperour sent ; so he</l>
     <l n="8349">Departing gave command , and they observed .</l>
     <l n="8350">As when the Tartar from his Russian foe ,</l>
     <l n="8351">By Astracan , over the snowy plains ,</l>
     <l n="8352">Retires ; or Bactrin Sophi , from the horns</l>
     <l n="8353">Of Turkish crescent , leaves all waste beyond</l>
     <l n="8354">The realm of Aladule , in his retreat</l>
     <l n="8355">To Tauris or Casbeen : So these , the late</l>
     <l n="8356">Heaven-banished host , left desart utmost Hell</l>
     <l n="8357">Many a dark league , reduced in careful watch</l>
     <l n="8358">Round their metropolis ; and now expecting</l>
     <l n="8359">Each hour their great adventurer , from the search</l>
     <l n="8360">Of foreign worlds : He through the midst unmarked ,</l>
     <l n="8361">In show plebeian Angel militant</l>
     <l n="8362">Of lowest order , passed ; and from the door</l>
     <l n="8363">Of that Plutonian hall , invisible</l>
     <l n="8364">Ascended his high throne ; which , under state</l>
     <l n="8365">Of richest texture spread , at the upper end</l>
     <l n="8366">Was placed in regal lustre . Down a while</l>
     <l n="8367">He sat , and round about him saw unseen :</l>
     <l n="8368">At last , as from a cloud , his fulgent head</l>
     <l n="8369">And shape star-bright appeared , or brighter ; clad</l>
     <l n="8370">With what permissive glory since his fall</l>
     <l n="8371">Was left him , or false glitter : All amazed</l>
     <l n="8372">At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng</l>
     <l n="8373">Bent their aspect , and whom they wished beheld ,</l>
     <l n="8374">Their mighty Chief returned : loud was the acclaim :</l>
     <l n="8375">Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers ,</l>
     <l n="8376">Raised from their dark Divan , and with like joy</l>
     <l n="8377">Congratulant approached him ; who with hand</l>
     <l n="8378">Silence , and with these words attention , won .</l>
     <l n="8379">Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers ;</l>
     <l n="8380">For in possession such , not only of right ,</l>
     <l n="8381">I call ye , and declare ye now ; returned</l>
     <l n="8382">Successful beyond hope , to lead ye forth</l>
     <l n="8383">Triumphant out of this infernal pit</l>
     <l n="8384">Abominable , accursed , the house of woe ,</l>
     <l n="8385">And dungeon of our tyrant : Now possess ,</l>
     <l n="8386">As Lords , a spacious world , to our native Heaven</l>
     <l n="8387">Little inferiour , by my adventure hard</l>
     <l n="8388">With peril great achieved . Long were to tell</l>
     <l n="8389">What I have done ; what suffered ; with what pain</l>
     <l n="8390">Voyaged th ’ unreal , vast , unbounded deep</l>
     <l n="8391">Of horrible confusion ; over which</l>
     <l n="8392">By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved ,</l>
     <l n="8393">To expedite your glorious march ; but I</l>
     <l n="8394">Toiled out my uncouth passage , forced to ride</l>
     <l n="8395">The untractable abyss , plunged in the womb</l>
     <l n="8396">Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild ;</l>
     <l n="8397">That , jealous of their secrets , fiercely opposed</l>
     <l n="8398">My journey strange , with clamorous uproar</l>
     <l n="8399">Protesting Fate supreme ; thence how I found</l>
     <l n="8400">The new created world , which fame in Heaven</l>
     <l n="8401">Long had foretold , a fabrick wonderful</l>
     <l n="8402">Of absolute perfection ! therein Man</l>
     <l n="8403">Placed in a Paradise , by our exile</l>
     <l n="8404">Made happy : Him by fraud I have seduced</l>
     <l n="8405">From his Creator ; and , the more to encrease</l>
     <l n="8406">Your wonder , with an apple ; he , thereat</l>
     <l n="8407">Offended , worth your laughter ! hath given up</l>
     <l n="8408">Both his beloved Man , and all his world ,</l>
     <l n="8409">To Sin and Death a prey , and so to us ,</l>
     <l n="8410">Without our hazard , labour , or alarm ;</l>
     <l n="8411">To range in , and to dwell , and over Man</l>
     <l n="8412">To rule , as over all he should have ruled .</l>
     <l n="8413">True is , me also he hath judged , or rather</l>
     <l n="8414">Me not , but the brute serpent in whose shape</l>
     <l n="8415">Man I deceived : that which to me belongs ,</l>
     <l n="8416">Is enmity which he will put between</l>
     <l n="8417">Me and mankind ; I am to bruise his heel ;</l>
     <l n="8418">His seed , when is not set , shall bruise my head :</l>
     <l n="8419">A world who would not purchase with a bruise ,</l>
     <l n="8420">Or much more grievous pain ?— Ye have the account</l>
     <l n="8421">Of my performance : What remains , ye Gods ,</l>
     <l n="8422">But up , and enter now into full bliss ?</l>
     <l n="8423">So having said , a while he stood , expecting</l>
     <l n="8424">Their universal shout , and high applause ,</l>
     <l n="8425">To fill his ear ; when , contrary , he hears</l>
     <l n="8426">On all sides , from innumerable tongues ,</l>
     <l n="8427">A dismal universal hiss , the sound</l>
     <l n="8428">Of publick scorn ; he wondered , but not long</l>
     <l n="8429">Had leisure , wondering at himself now more ,</l>
     <l n="8430">His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare ;</l>
     <l n="8431">His arms clung to his ribs ; his legs entwining</l>
     <l n="8432">Each other , till supplanted down he fell</l>
     <l n="8433">A monstrous serpent on his belly prone ,</l>
     <l n="8434">Reluctant , but in vain ; a greater power</l>
     <l n="8435">Now ruled him , punished in the shape he sinned ,</l>
     <l n="8436">According to his doom : he would have spoke ,</l>
     <l n="8437">But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue</l>
     <l n="8438">To forked tongue ; for now were all transformed</l>
     <l n="8439">Alike , to serpents all , as accessories</l>
     <l n="8440">To his bold riot : Dreadful was the din</l>
     <l n="8441">Of hissing through the hall , thick swarming now</l>
     <l n="8442">With complicated monsters head and tail ,</l>
     <l n="8443">Scorpion , and Asp , and Amphisbaena dire ,</l>
     <l n="8444">Cerastes horned , Hydrus , and Elops drear ,</l>
     <l n="8445">And Dipsas ; ( not so thick swarmed once the soil</l>
     <l n="8446">Bedropt with blood of Gorgon , or the isle</l>
     <l n="8447">Ophiusa ,) but still greatest he the midst ,</l>
     <l n="8448">Now Dragon grown , larger than whom the sun</l>
     <l n="8449">Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime ,</l>
     <l n="8450">Huge Python , and his power no less he seemed</l>
     <l n="8451">Above the rest still to retain ; they all</l>
     <l n="8452">Him followed , issuing forth to the open field ,</l>
     <l n="8453">Where all yet left of that revolted rout ,</l>
     <l n="8454">Heaven-fallen , in station stood or just array ;</l>
     <l n="8455">Sublime with expectation when to see</l>
     <l n="8456">In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief ;</l>
     <l n="8457">They saw , but other sight instead ! a croud</l>
     <l n="8458">Of ugly serpents ; horrour on them fell ,</l>
     <l n="8459">And horrid sympathy ; for , what they saw ,</l>
     <l n="8460">They felt themselves , now changing ; down their arms ,</l>
     <l n="8461">Down fell both spear and shield ; down they as fast ;</l>
     <l n="8462">And the dire hiss renewed , and the dire form</l>
     <l n="8463">Catched , by contagion ; like in punishment ,</l>
     <l n="8464">As in their crime . Thus was the applause they meant ,</l>
     <l n="8465">Turned to exploding hiss , triumph to shame</l>
     <l n="8466">Cast on themselves from their own mouths . There stood</l>
     <l n="8467">A grove hard by , sprung up with this their change ,</l>
     <l n="8468">His will who reigns above , to aggravate</l>
     <l n="8469">Their penance , laden with fair fruit , like that</l>
     <l n="8470">Which grew in Paradise , the bait of Eve</l>
     <l n="8471">Used by the Tempter : on that prospect strange</l>
     <l n="8472">Their earnest eyes they fixed , imagining</l>
     <l n="8473">For one forbidden tree a multitude</l>
     <l n="8474">Now risen , to work them further woe or shame ;</l>
     <l n="8475">Yet , parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce ,</l>
     <l n="8476">Though to delude them sent , could not abstain ;</l>
     <l n="8477">But on they rolled in heaps , and , up the trees</l>
     <l n="8478">Climbing , sat thicker than the snaky locks</l>
     <l n="8479">That curled Megaera : greedily they plucked</l>
     <l n="8480">The fruitage fair to sight , like that which grew</l>
     <l n="8481">Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed ;</l>
     <l n="8482">This more delusive , not the touch , but taste</l>
     <l n="8483">Deceived ; they , fondly thinking to allay</l>
     <l n="8484">Their appetite with gust , instead of fruit</l>
     <l n="8485">Chewed bitter ashes , which the offended taste</l>
     <l n="8486">With spattering noise rejected : oft they assayed ,</l>
     <l n="8487">Hunger and thirst constraining ; drugged as oft ,</l>
     <l n="8488">With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws ,</l>
     <l n="8489">With soot and cinders filled ; so oft they fell</l>
     <l n="8490">Into the same illusion , not as Man</l>
     <l n="8491">Whom they triumphed once lapsed . Thus were they plagued</l>
     <l n="8492">And worn with famine , long and ceaseless hiss ,</l>
     <l n="8493">Till their lost shape , permitted , they resumed ;</l>
     <l n="8494">Yearly enjoined , some say , to undergo ,</l>
     <l n="8495">This annual humbling certain numbered days ,</l>
     <l n="8496">To dash their pride , and joy , for Man seduced .</l>
     <l n="8497">However , some tradition they dispersed</l>
     <l n="8498">Among the Heathen , of their purchase got ,</l>
     <l n="8499">And fabled how the Serpent , whom they called</l>
     <l n="8500">Ophion , with Eurynome , the wide —</l>
     <l n="8501">Encroaching Eve perhaps , had first the rule</l>
     <l n="8502">Of high Olympus ; thence by Saturn driven</l>
     <l n="8503">And Ops , ere yet Dictaean Jove was born .</l>
     <l n="8504">Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair</l>
     <l n="8505">Too soon arrived ; Sin , there in power before ,</l>
     <l n="8506">Once actual ; now in body , and to dwell</l>
     <l n="8507">Habitual habitant ; behind her Death ,</l>
     <l n="8508">Close following pace for pace , not mounted yet</l>
     <l n="8509">On his pale horse : to whom Sin thus began .</l>
     <l n="8510">Second of Satan sprung , all-conquering Death !</l>
     <l n="8511">What thinkest thou of our empire now , though earned</l>
     <l n="8512">With travel difficult , not better far</l>
     <l n="8513">Than still at Hell 's dark threshold to have sat watch ,</l>
     <l n="8514">Unnamed , undreaded , and thyself half starved ?</l>
     <l n="8515">Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon .</l>
     <l n="8516">To me , who with eternal famine pine ,</l>
     <l n="8517">Alike is Hell , or Paradise , or Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="8518">There best , where most with ravine I may meet ;</l>
     <l n="8519">Which here , though plenteous , all too little seems</l>
     <l n="8520">To stuff this maw , this vast unhide-bound corps .</l>
     <l n="8521">To whom the incestuous mother thus replied .</l>
     <l n="8522">Thou therefore on these herbs , and fruits , and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="8523">Feed first ; on each beast next , and fish , and fowl ;</l>
     <l n="8524">No homely morsels ! and , whatever thing</l>
     <l n="8525">The sithe of Time mows down , devour unspared ;</l>
     <l n="8526">Till I , in Man residing , through the race ,</l>
     <l n="8527">His thoughts , his looks , words , actions , all infect ;</l>
     <l n="8528">And season him thy last and sweetest prey .</l>
     <l n="8529">This said , they both betook them several ways ,</l>
     <l n="8530">Both to destroy , or unimmortal make</l>
     <l n="8531">All kinds , and for destruction to mature</l>
     <l n="8532">Sooner or later ; which the Almighty seeing ,</l>
     <l n="8533">From his transcendent seat the Saints among ,</l>
     <l n="8534">To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice .</l>
     <l n="8535">See , with what heat these dogs of Hell advance</l>
     <l n="8536">To waste and havock yonder world , which I</l>
     <l n="8537">So fair and good created ; and had still</l>
     <l n="8538">Kept in that state , had not the folly of Man</l>
     <l n="8539">Let in these wasteful furies , who impute</l>
     <l n="8540">Folly to me ; so doth the Prince of Hell</l>
     <l n="8541">And his adherents , that with so much ease</l>
     <l n="8542">I suffer them to enter and possess</l>
     <l n="8543">A place so heavenly ; and , conniving , seem</l>
     <l n="8544">To gratify my scornful enemies ,</l>
     <l n="8545">That laugh , as if , transported with some fit</l>
     <l n="8546">Of passion , I to them had quitted all ,</l>
     <l n="8547">At random yielded up to their misrule ;</l>
     <l n="8548">And know not that I called , and drew them thither ,</l>
     <l n="8549">My Hell-hounds , to lick up the draff and filth</l>
     <l n="8550">Which Man 's polluting sin with taint hath shed</l>
     <l n="8551">On what was pure ; til , crammed and gorged , nigh burst</l>
     <l n="8552">With sucked and glutted offal , at one sling</l>
     <l n="8553">Of thy victorious arm , well-pleasing Son ,</l>
     <l n="8554">Both Sin , and Death , and yawning Grave , at last ,</l>
     <l n="8555">Through Chaos hurled , obstruct the mouth of Hell</l>
     <l n="8556">For ever , and seal up his ravenous jaws .</l>
     <l n="8557">Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure</l>
     <l n="8558">To sanctity , that shall receive no stain :</l>
     <l n="8559">Till then , the curse pronounced on both precedes .</l>
     <l n="8560">He ended , and the heavenly audience loud</l>
     <l n="8561">Sung Halleluiah , as the sound of seas ,</l>
     <l n="8562">Through multitude that sung : Just are thy ways ,</l>
     <l n="8563">Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works ;</l>
     <l n="8564">Who can extenuate thee ? Next , to the Son ,</l>
     <l n="8565">Destined Restorer of mankind , by whom</l>
     <l n="8566">New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise ,</l>
     <l n="8567">Or down from Heaven descend .— Such was their song ;</l>
     <l n="8568">While the Creator , calling forth by name</l>
     <l n="8569">His mighty Angels , gave them several charge ,</l>
     <l n="8570">As sorted best with present things . The sun</l>
     <l n="8571">Had first his precept so to move , so shine ,</l>
     <l n="8572">As might affect the earth with cold and heat</l>
     <l n="8573">Scarce tolerable ; and from the north to call</l>
     <l n="8574">Decrepit winter ; from the south to bring</l>
     <l n="8575">Solstitial summer 's heat . To the blanc moon</l>
     <l n="8576">Her office they prescribed ; to the other five</l>
     <l n="8577">Their planetary motions , and aspects ,</l>
     <l n="8578">In sextile , square , and trine , and opposite ,</l>
     <l n="8579">Of noxious efficacy , and when to join</l>
     <l n="8580">In synod unbenign ; and taught the fixed</l>
     <l n="8581">Their influence malignant when to shower ,</l>
     <l n="8582">Which of them rising with the sun , or falling ,</l>
     <l n="8583">Should prove tempestuous : To the winds they set</l>
     <l n="8584">Their corners , when with bluster to confound</l>
     <l n="8585">Sea , air , and shore ; the thunder when to roll</l>
     <l n="8586">With terrour through the dark aereal hall .</l>
     <l n="8587">Some say , he bid his Angels turn ascanse</l>
     <l n="8588">The poles of earth , twice ten degrees and more ,</l>
     <l n="8589">From the sun 's axle ; they with labour pushed</l>
     <l n="8590">Oblique the centrick globe : Some say , the sun</l>
     <l n="8591">Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road</l>
     <l n="8592">Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven</l>
     <l n="8593">Atlantick Sisters , and the Spartan Twins ,</l>
     <l n="8594">Up to the Tropick Crab : thence down amain</l>
     <l n="8595">By Leo , and the Virgin , and the Scales ,</l>
     <l n="8596">As deep as Capricorn ; to bring in change</l>
     <l n="8597">Of seasons to each clime ; else had the spring</l>
     <l n="8598">Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers ,</l>
     <l n="8599">Equal in days and nights , except to those</l>
     <l n="8600">Beyond the polar circles ; to them day</l>
     <l n="8601">Had unbenighted shone , while the low sun ,</l>
     <l n="8602">To recompense his distance , in their sight</l>
     <l n="8603">Had rounded still the horizon , and not known</l>
     <l n="8604">Or east or west ; which had forbid the snow</l>
     <l n="8605">From cold Estotiland , and south as far</l>
     <l n="8606">Beneath Magellan . At that tasted fruit</l>
     <l n="8607">The sun , as from Thyestean banquet , turned</l>
     <l n="8608">His course intended ; else , how had the world</l>
     <l n="8609">Inhabited , though sinless , more than now ,</l>
     <l n="8610">Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat ?</l>
     <l n="8611">These changes in the Heavens , though slow , produced</l>
     <l n="8612">Like change on sea and land ; sideral blast ,</l>
     <l n="8613">Vapour , and mist , and exhalation hot ,</l>
     <l n="8614">Corrupt and pestilent : Now from the north</l>
     <l n="8615">Of Norumbega , and the Samoed shore ,</l>
     <l n="8616">Bursting their brazen dungeon , armed with ice ,</l>
     <l n="8617">And snow , and hail , and stormy gust and flaw ,</l>
     <l n="8618">Boreas , and Caecias , and Argestes loud ,</l>
     <l n="8619">And Thrascias , rend the woods , and seas upturn ;</l>
     <l n="8620">With adverse blast upturns them from the south</l>
     <l n="8621">Notus , and Afer black with thunderous clouds</l>
     <l n="8622">From Serraliona ; thwart of these , as fierce ,</l>
     <l n="8623">Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds ,</l>
     <l n="8624">Eurus and Zephyr , with their lateral noise ,</l>
     <l n="8625">Sirocco and Libecchio . Thus began</l>
     <l n="8626">Outrage from lifeless things ; but Discord first ,</l>
     <l n="8627">Daughter of Sin , among the irrational</l>
     <l n="8628">Death introduced , through fierce antipathy :</l>
     <l n="8629">Beast now with beast ‘ gan war , and fowl with fowl ,</l>
     <l n="8630">And fish with fish ; to graze the herb all leaving ,</l>
     <l n="8631">Devoured each other ; nor stood much in awe</l>
     <l n="8632">Of Man , but fled him ; or , with countenance grim ,</l>
     <l n="8633">Glared on him passing . These were from without</l>
     <l n="8634">The growing miseries , which Adam saw</l>
     <l n="8635">Already in part , though hid in gloomiest shade ,</l>
     <l n="8636">To sorrow abandoned , but worse felt within ;</l>
     <l n="8637">And , in a troubled sea of passion tost ,</l>
     <l n="8638">Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint .</l>
     <l n="8639">O miserable of happy ! Is this the end</l>
     <l n="8640">Of this new glorious world , and me so late</l>
     <l n="8641">The glory of that glory , who now become</l>
     <l n="8642">Accursed , of blessed ? hide me from the face</l>
     <l n="8643">Of God , whom to behold was then my highth</l>
     <l n="8644">Of happiness !— Yet well , if here would end</l>
     <l n="8645">The misery ; I deserved it , and would bear</l>
     <l n="8646">My own deservings ; but this will not serve :</l>
     <l n="8647">All that I eat or drink , or shall beget ,</l>
     <l n="8648">Is propagated curse . O voice , once heard</l>
     <l n="8649">Delightfully , Encrease and multiply ;</l>
     <l n="8650">Now death to hear ! for what can I encrease ,</l>
     <l n="8651">Or multiply , but curses on my head ?</l>
     <l n="8652">Who of all ages to succeed , but , feeling</l>
     <l n="8653">The evil on him brought by me , will curse</l>
     <l n="8654">My head ? Ill fare our ancestor impure ,</l>
     <l n="8655">For this we may thank Adam ! but his thanks</l>
     <l n="8656">Shall be the execration : so , besides</l>
     <l n="8657">Mine own that bide upon me , all from me</l>
     <l n="8658">Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound ;</l>
     <l n="8659">On me , as on their natural center , light</l>
     <l n="8660">Heavy , though in their place . O fleeting joys</l>
     <l n="8661">Of Paradise , dear bought with lasting woes !</l>
     <l n="8662">Did I request thee , Maker , from my clay</l>
     <l n="8663">To mould me Man ? did I solicit thee</l>
     <l n="8664">From darkness to promote me , or here place</l>
     <l n="8665">In this delicious garden ? As my will</l>
     <l n="8666">Concurred not to my being , it were but right</l>
     <l n="8667">And equal to reduce me to my dust ;</l>
     <l n="8668">Desirous to resign and render back</l>
     <l n="8669">All I received ; unable to perform</l>
     <l n="8670">Thy terms too hard , by which I was to hold</l>
     <l n="8671">The good I sought not . To the loss of that ,</l>
     <l n="8672">Sufficient penalty , why hast thou added</l>
     <l n="8673">The sense of endless woes ? Inexplicable</l>
     <l n="8674">Thy justice seems ; yet to say truth , too late</l>
     <l n="8675">I thus contest ; then should have been refused</l>
     <l n="8676">Those terms whatever , when they were proposed :</l>
     <l n="8677">Thou didst accept them ; wilt thou enjoy the good ,</l>
     <l n="8678">Then cavil the conditions ? And , though God</l>
     <l n="8679">Made thee without thy leave , what if thy son</l>
     <l n="8680">Prove disobedient , and reproved , retort ,</l>
     <l n="8681">“ Wherefore didst thou beget me ? I sought it not ! ”</l>
     <l n="8682">Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee</l>
     <l n="8683">That proud excuse ? yet him not thy election ,</l>
     <l n="8684">But natural necessity begot .</l>
     <l n="8685">God made thee of choice his own , and of his own</l>
     <l n="8686">To serve him ; thy reward was of his grace ;</l>
     <l n="8687">Thy punishment then , justly is at his will .</l>
     <l n="8688">Be it so , for I submit ; his doom is fair ,</l>
     <l n="8689">That dust I am , and shall to dust return .</l>
     <l n="8690">O welcome hour whenever ! Why delays</l>
     <l n="8691">His hand to execute what his decree</l>
     <l n="8692">Fixed on this day ? Why do I overlive ,</l>
     <l n="8693">Why am I mocked with death , and lengthened out</l>
     <l n="8694">To deathless pain ? How gladly would I meet</l>
     <l n="8695">Mortality my sentence , and be earth</l>
     <l n="8696">Insensible ! How glad would lay me down</l>
     <l n="8697">As in my mother 's lap ! There I should rest ,</l>
     <l n="8698">And sleep secure ; his dreadful voice no more</l>
     <l n="8699">Would thunder in my ears ; no fear of worse</l>
     <l n="8700">To me , and to my offspring , would torment me</l>
     <l n="8701">With cruel expectation . Yet one doubt</l>
     <l n="8702">Pursues me still , lest all I cannot die ;</l>
     <l n="8703">Lest that pure breath of life , the spirit of Man</l>
     <l n="8704">Which God inspired , cannot together perish</l>
     <l n="8705">With this corporeal clod ; then , in the grave ,</l>
     <l n="8706">Or in some other dismal place , who knows</l>
     <l n="8707">But I shall die a living death ? O thought</l>
     <l n="8708">Horrid , if true ! Yet why ? It was but breath</l>
     <l n="8709">Of life that sinned ; what dies but what had life</l>
     <l n="8710">And sin ? The body properly had neither ,</l>
     <l n="8711">All of me then shall die : let this appease</l>
     <l n="8712">The doubt , since human reach no further knows .</l>
     <l n="8713">For though the Lord of all be infinite ,</l>
     <l n="8714">Is his wrath also ? Be it , Man is not so ,</l>
     <l n="8715">But mortal doomed . How can he exercise</l>
     <l n="8716">Wrath without end on Man , whom death must end ?</l>
     <l n="8717">Can he make deathless death ? That were to make</l>
     <l n="8718">Strange contradiction , which to God himself</l>
     <l n="8719">Impossible is held ; as argument</l>
     <l n="8720">Of weakness , not of power . Will he draw out ,</l>
     <l n="8721">For anger 's sake , finite to infinite ,</l>
     <l n="8722">In punished Man , to satisfy his rigour ,</l>
     <l n="8723">Satisfied never ? That were to extend</l>
     <l n="8724">His sentence beyond dust and Nature 's law ;</l>
     <l n="8725">By which all causes else , according still</l>
     <l n="8726">To the reception of their matter , act ;</l>
     <l n="8727">Not to the extent of their own sphere . But say</l>
     <l n="8728">That death be not one stroke , as I supposed ,</l>
     <l n="8729">Bereaving sense , but endless misery</l>
     <l n="8730">From this day onward ; which I feel begun</l>
     <l n="8731">Both in me , and without me ; and so last</l>
     <l n="8732">To perpetuity ;— Ay me ! that fear</l>
     <l n="8733">Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution</l>
     <l n="8734">On my defenceless head ; both Death and I</l>
     <l n="8735">Am found eternal , and incorporate both ;</l>
     <l n="8736">Nor I on my part single ; in me all</l>
     <l n="8737">Posterity stands cursed : Fair patrimony</l>
     <l n="8738">That I must leave ye , Sons ! O , were I able</l>
     <l n="8739">To waste it all myself , and leave ye none !</l>
     <l n="8740">So disinherited , how would you bless</l>
     <l n="8741">Me , now your curse ! Ah , why should all mankind ,</l>
     <l n="8742">For one man 's fault , thus guiltless be condemned ,</l>
     <l n="8743">It guiltless ? But from me what can proceed ,</l>
     <l n="8744">But all corrupt ; both mind and will depraved</l>
     <l n="8745">Not to do only , but to will the same</l>
     <l n="8746">With me ? How can they then acquitted stand</l>
     <l n="8747">In sight of God ? Him , after all disputes ,</l>
     <l n="8748">Forced I absolve : all my evasions vain ,</l>
     <l n="8749">And reasonings , though through mazes , lead me still</l>
     <l n="8750">But to my own conviction : first and last</l>
     <l n="8751">On me , me only , as the source and spring</l>
     <l n="8752">Of all corruption , all the blame lights due ;</l>
     <l n="8753">So might the wrath ! Fond wish ! couldst thou support</l>
     <l n="8754">That burden , heavier than the earth to bear ;</l>
     <l n="8755">Than all the world much heavier , though divided</l>
     <l n="8756">With that bad Woman ? Thus , what thou desirest ,</l>
     <l n="8757">And what thou fearest , alike destroys all hope</l>
     <l n="8758">Of refuge , and concludes thee miserable</l>
     <l n="8759">Beyond all past example and future ;</l>
     <l n="8760">To Satan only like both crime and doom .</l>
     <l n="8761">O Conscience ! into what abyss of fears</l>
     <l n="8762">And horrours hast thou driven me ; out of which</l>
     <l n="8763">I find no way , from deep to deeper plunged !</l>
     <l n="8764">Thus Adam to himself lamented loud ,</l>
     <l n="8765">Through the still night ; not now , as ere Man fell ,</l>
     <l n="8766">Wholesome , and cool , and mild , but with black air</l>
     <l n="8767">Accompanied ; with damps , and dreadful gloom ;</l>
     <l n="8768">Which to his evil conscience represented</l>
     <l n="8769">All things with double terrour : On the ground</l>
     <l n="8770">Outstretched he lay , on the cold ground ; and oft</l>
     <l n="8771">Cursed his creation ; Death as oft accused</l>
     <l n="8772">Of tardy execution , since denounced</l>
     <l n="8773">The day of his offence . Why comes not Death ,</l>
     <l n="8774">Said he , with one thrice-acceptable stroke</l>
     <l n="8775">To end me ? Shall Truth fail to keep her word ,</l>
     <l n="8776">Justice Divine not hasten to be just ?</l>
     <l n="8777">But Death comes not at call ; Justice Divine</l>
     <l n="8778">Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries ,</l>
     <l n="8779">O woods , O fountains , hillocks , dales , and bowers !</l>
     <l n="8780">With other echo late I taught your shades</l>
     <l n="8781">To answer , and resound far other song .—</l>
     <l n="8782">Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld ,</l>
     <l n="8783">Desolate where she sat , approaching nigh ,</l>
     <l n="8784">Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed :</l>
     <l n="8785">But her with stern regard he thus repelled .</l>
     <l n="8786">Out of my sight , thou Serpent ! That name best</l>
     <l n="8787">Befits thee with him leagued , thyself as false</l>
     <l n="8788">And hateful ; nothing wants , but that thy shape ,</l>
     <l n="8789">Like his , and colour serpentine , may show</l>
     <l n="8790">Thy inward fraud ; to warn all creatures from thee</l>
     <l n="8791">Henceforth ; lest that too heavenly form , pretended</l>
     <l n="8792">To hellish falshood , snare them ! But for thee</l>
     <l n="8793">I had persisted happy ; had not thy pride</l>
     <l n="8794">And wandering vanity , when least was safe ,</l>
     <l n="8795">Rejected my forewarning , and disdained</l>
     <l n="8796">Not to be trusted ; longing to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="8797">Though by the Devil himself ; him overweening</l>
     <l n="8798">To over-reach ; but , with the serpent meeting ,</l>
     <l n="8799">Fooled and beguiled ; by him thou , I by thee</l>
     <l n="8800">To trust thee from my side ; imagined wise ,</l>
     <l n="8801">Constant , mature , proof against all assaults ;</l>
     <l n="8802">And understood not all was but a show ,</l>
     <l n="8803">Rather than solid virtue ; all but a rib</l>
     <l n="8804">Crooked by nature , bent , as now appears ,</l>
     <l n="8805">More to the part sinister , from me drawn ;</l>
     <l n="8806">Well if thrown out , as supernumerary</l>
     <l n="8807">To my just number found . O ! why did God ,</l>
     <l n="8808">Creator wise , that peopled highest Heaven</l>
     <l n="8809">With Spirits masculine , create at last</l>
     <l n="8810">This novelty on earth , this fair defect</l>
     <l n="8811">Of nature , and not fill the world at once</l>
     <l n="8812">With Men , as Angels , without feminine ;</l>
     <l n="8813">Or find some other way to generate</l>
     <l n="8814">Mankind ? This mischief had not been befallen ,</l>
     <l n="8815">And more that shall befall ; innumerable</l>
     <l n="8816">Disturbances on earth through female snares ,</l>
     <l n="8817">And strait conjunction with this sex : for either</l>
     <l n="8818">He never shall find out fit mate , but such</l>
     <l n="8819">As some misfortune brings him , or mistake ;</l>
     <l n="8820">Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain</l>
     <l n="8821">Through her perverseness , but shall see her gained</l>
     <l n="8822">By a far worse ; or , if she love , withheld</l>
     <l n="8823">By parents ; or his happiest choice too late</l>
     <l n="8824">Shall meet , already linked and wedlock-bound</l>
     <l n="8825">To a fell adversary , his hate or shame :</l>
     <l n="8826">Which infinite calamity shall cause</l>
     <l n="8827">To human life , and houshold peace confound .</l>
     <l n="8828">He added not , and from her turned ; but Eve ,</l>
     <l n="8829">Not so repulsed , with tears that ceased not flowing</l>
     <l n="8830">And tresses all disordered , at his feet</l>
     <l n="8831">Fell humble ; and , embracing them , besought</l>
     <l n="8832">His peace , and thus proceeded in her plaint .</l>
     <l n="8833">Forsake me not thus , Adam ! witness Heaven</l>
     <l n="8834">What love sincere , and reverence in my heart</l>
     <l n="8835">I bear thee , and unweeting have offended ,</l>
     <l n="8836">Unhappily deceived ! Thy suppliant</l>
     <l n="8837">I beg , and clasp thy knees ; bereave me not ,</l>
     <l n="8838">Whereon I live , thy gentle looks , thy aid ,</l>
     <l n="8839">Thy counsel , in this uttermost distress ,</l>
     <l n="8840">My only strength and stay : Forlorn of thee ,</l>
     <l n="8841">Whither shall I betake me , where subsist ?</l>
     <l n="8842">While yet we live , scarce one short hour perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="8843">Between us two let there be peace ; both joining ,</l>
     <l n="8844">As joined in injuries , one enmity</l>
     <l n="8845">Against a foe by doom express assigned us ,</l>
     <l n="8846">That cruel Serpent : On me exercise not</l>
     <l n="8847">Thy hatred for this misery befallen ;</l>
     <l n="8848">On me already lost , me than thyself</l>
     <l n="8849">More miserable ! Both have sinned ; but thou</l>
     <l n="8850">Against God only ; I against God and thee ;</l>
     <l n="8851">And to the place of judgement will return ,</l>
     <l n="8852">There with my cries importune Heaven ; that all</l>
     <l n="8853">The sentence , from thy head removed , may light</l>
     <l n="8854">On me , sole cause to thee of all this woe ;</l>
     <l n="8855">Me , me only , just object of his ire !</l>
     <l n="8856">She ended weeping ; and her lowly plight ,</l>
     <l n="8857">Immoveable , till peace obtained from fault</l>
     <l n="8858">Acknowledged and deplored , in Adam wrought</l>
     <l n="8859">Commiseration : Soon his heart relented</l>
     <l n="8860">Towards her , his life so late , and sole delight ,</l>
     <l n="8861">Now at his feet submissive in distress ;</l>
     <l n="8862">Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking ,</l>
     <l n="8863">His counsel , whom she had displeased , his aid :</l>
     <l n="8864">As one disarmed , his anger all he lost ,</l>
     <l n="8865">And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon .</l>
     <l n="8866">Unwary , and too desirous , as before ,</l>
     <l n="8867">So now of what thou knowest not , who desirest</l>
     <l n="8868">The punishment all on thyself ; alas !</l>
     <l n="8869">Bear thine own first , ill able to sustain</l>
     <l n="8870">His full wrath , whose thou feelest as yet least part ,</l>
     <l n="8871">And my displeasure bearest so ill . If prayers</l>
     <l n="8872">Could alter high decrees , I to that place</l>
     <l n="8873">Would speed before thee , and be louder heard ,</l>
     <l n="8874">That on my head all might be visited ;</l>
     <l n="8875">Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven ,</l>
     <l n="8876">To me committed , and by me exposed .</l>
     <l n="8877">But rise ;— let us no more contend , nor blame</l>
     <l n="8878">Each other , blamed enough elsewhere ; but strive</l>
     <l n="8879">In offices of love , how we may lighten</l>
     <l n="8880">Each other 's burden , in our share of woe ;</l>
     <l n="8881">Since this day 's death denounced , if aught I see ,</l>
     <l n="8882">Will prove no sudden , but a slow-paced evil ;</l>
     <l n="8883">A long day 's dying , to augment our pain ;</l>
     <l n="8884">And to our seed ( O hapless seed ! ) derived .</l>
     <l n="8885">To whom thus Eve , recovering heart , replied .</l>
     <l n="8886">Adam , by sad experiment I know</l>
     <l n="8887">How little weight my words with thee can find ,</l>
     <l n="8888">Found so erroneous ; thence by just event</l>
     <l n="8889">Found so unfortunate : Nevertheless ,</l>
     <l n="8890">Restored by thee , vile as I am , to place</l>
     <l n="8891">Of new acceptance , hopeful to regain</l>
     <l n="8892">Thy love , the sole contentment of my heart</l>
     <l n="8893">Living or dying , from thee I will not hide</l>
     <l n="8894">What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen ,</l>
     <l n="8895">Tending to some relief of our extremes ,</l>
     <l n="8896">Or end ; though sharp and sad , yet tolerable ,</l>
     <l n="8897">As in our evils , and of easier choice .</l>
     <l n="8898">If care of our descent perplex us most ,</l>
     <l n="8899">Which must be born to certain woe , devoured</l>
     <l n="8900">By Death at last ; and miserable it is</l>
     <l n="8901">To be to others cause of misery ,</l>
     <l n="8902">Our own begotten , and of our loins to bring</l>
     <l n="8903">Into this cursed world a woeful race ,</l>
     <l n="8904">That after wretched life must be at last</l>
     <l n="8905">Food for so foul a monster ; in thy power</l>
     <l n="8906">It lies , yet ere conception to prevent</l>
     <l n="8907">The race unblest , to being yet unbegot .</l>
     <l n="8908">Childless thou art , childless remain : so Death</l>
     <l n="8909">Shall be deceived his glut , and with us two</l>
     <l n="8910">Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw .</l>
     <l n="8911">But if thou judge it hard and difficult ,</l>
     <l n="8912">Conversing , looking , loving , to abstain</l>
     <l n="8913">From love 's due rights , nuptial embraces sweet ;</l>
     <l n="8914">And with desire to languish without hope ,</l>
     <l n="8915">Before the present object languishing</l>
     <l n="8916">With like desire ; which would be misery</l>
     <l n="8917">And torment less than none of what we dread ;</l>
     <l n="8918">Then , both ourselves and seed at once to free</l>
     <l n="8919">From what we fear for both , let us make short ,—</l>
     <l n="8920">Let us seek Death ;— or , he not found , supply</l>
     <l n="8921">With our own hands his office on ourselves :</l>
     <l n="8922">Why stand we longer shivering under fears ,</l>
     <l n="8923">That show no end but death , and have the power ,</l>
     <l n="8924">Of many ways to die the shortest choosing ,</l>
     <l n="8925">Destruction with destruction to destroy ?—</l>
     <l n="8926">She ended here , or vehement despair</l>
     <l n="8927">Broke off the rest : so much of death her thoughts</l>
     <l n="8928">Had entertained , as dyed her cheeks with pale .</l>
     <l n="8929">But Adam , with such counsel nothing swayed ,</l>
     <l n="8930">To better hopes his more attentive mind</l>
     <l n="8931">Labouring had raised ; and thus to Eve replied .</l>
     <l n="8932">Eve , thy contempt of life and pleasure seems</l>
     <l n="8933">To argue in thee something more sublime</l>
     <l n="8934">And excellent , than what thy mind contemns ;</l>
     <l n="8935">But self-destruction therefore sought , refutes</l>
     <l n="8936">That excellence thought in thee ; and implies ,</l>
     <l n="8937">Not thy contempt , but anguish and regret</l>
     <l n="8938">For loss of life and pleasure overloved .</l>
     <l n="8939">Or if thou covet death , as utmost end</l>
     <l n="8940">Of misery , so thinking to evade</l>
     <l n="8941">The penalty pronounced ; doubt not but God</l>
     <l n="8942">Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire , than so</l>
     <l n="8943">To be forestalled ; much more I fear lest death ,</l>
     <l n="8944">So snatched , will not exempt us from the pain</l>
     <l n="8945">We are by doom to pay ; rather , such acts</l>
     <l n="8946">Of contumacy will provoke the Highest</l>
     <l n="8947">To make death in us live : Then let us seek</l>
     <l n="8948">Some safer resolution , which methinks</l>
     <l n="8949">I have in view , calling to mind with heed</l>
     <l n="8950">Part of our sentence , that thy seed shall bruise</l>
     <l n="8951">The Serpent 's head ; piteous amends ! unless</l>
     <l n="8952">Be meant , whom I conjecture , our grand foe ,</l>
     <l n="8953">Satan ; who , in the serpent , hath contrived</l>
     <l n="8954">Against us this deceit : To crush his head</l>
     <l n="8955">Would be revenge indeed ! which will be lost</l>
     <l n="8956">By death brought on ourselves , or childless days</l>
     <l n="8957">Resolved , as thou proposest ; so our foe</l>
     <l n="8958">Shal ‘ scape his punishment ordained , and we</l>
     <l n="8959">Instead shall double ours upon our heads .</l>
     <l n="8960">No more be mentioned then of violence</l>
     <l n="8961">Against ourselves ; and wilful barrenness ,</l>
     <l n="8962">That cuts us off from hope ; and savours only</l>
     <l n="8963">Rancour and pride , impatience and despite ,</l>
     <l n="8964">Reluctance against God and his just yoke</l>
     <l n="8965">Laid on our necks . Remember with what mild</l>
     <l n="8966">And gracious temper he both heard , and judged ,</l>
     <l n="8967">Without wrath or reviling ; we expected</l>
     <l n="8968">Immediate dissolution , which we thought</l>
     <l n="8969">Was meant by death that day ; when lo ! to thee</l>
     <l n="8970">Pains only in child-bearing were foretold ,</l>
     <l n="8971">And bringing forth ; soon recompensed with joy ,</l>
     <l n="8972">Fruit of thy womb : On me the curse aslope</l>
     <l n="8973">Glanced on the ground ; with labour I must earn</l>
     <l n="8974">My bread ; what harm ? Idleness had been worse ;</l>
     <l n="8975">My labour will sustain me ; and , lest cold</l>
     <l n="8976">Or heat should injure us , his timely care</l>
     <l n="8977">Hath , unbesought , provided ; and his hands</l>
     <l n="8978">Clothed us unworthy , pitying while he judged ;</l>
     <l n="8979">How much more , if we pray him , will his ear</l>
     <l n="8980">Be open , and his heart to pity incline ,</l>
     <l n="8981">And teach us further by what means to shun</l>
     <l n="8982">The inclement seasons , rain , ice , hail , and snow !</l>
     <l n="8983">Which now the sky , with various face , begins</l>
     <l n="8984">To show us in this mountain ; while the winds</l>
     <l n="8985">Blow moist and keen , shattering the graceful locks</l>
     <l n="8986">Of these fair spreading trees ; which bids us seek</l>
     <l n="8987">Some better shroud , some better warmth to cherish</l>
     <l n="8988">Our limbs benummed , ere this diurnal star</l>
     <l n="8989">Leave cold the night , how we his gathered beams</l>
     <l n="8990">Reflected may with matter sere foment ;</l>
     <l n="8991">Or , by collision of two bodies , grind</l>
     <l n="8992">The air attrite to fire ; as late the clouds</l>
     <l n="8993">Justling , or pushed with winds , rude in their shock ,</l>
     <l n="8994">Tine the slant lightning ; whose thwart flame , driven down</l>
     <l n="8995">Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine ;</l>
     <l n="8996">And sends a comfortable heat from far ,</l>
     <l n="8997">Which might supply the sun : Such fire to use ,</l>
     <l n="8998">And what may else be remedy or cure</l>
     <l n="8999">To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought ,</l>
     <l n="9000">He will instruct us praying , and of grace</l>
     <l n="9001">Beseeching him ; so as we need not fear</l>
     <l n="9002">To pass commodiously this life , sustained</l>
     <l n="9003">By him with many comforts , till we end</l>
     <l n="9004">In dust , our final rest and native home .</l>
     <l n="9005">What better can we do , than , to the place</l>
     <l n="9006">Repairing where he judged us , prostrate fall</l>
     <l n="9007">Before him reverent ; and there confess</l>
     <l n="9008">Humbly our faults , and pardon beg ; with tears</l>
     <l n="9009">Watering the ground , and with our sighs the air</l>
     <l n="9010">Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign</l>
     <l n="9011">Of sorrow unfeigned , and humiliation meek .</l>
     <l n="9012">Undoubtedly he will relent , and turn</l>
     <l n="9013">From his displeasure ; in whose look serene ,</l>
     <l n="9014">When angry most he seemed and most severe ,</l>
     <l n="9015">What else but favour , grace , and mercy , shone ?</l>
     <l n="9016">So spake our father penitent ; nor Eve</l>
     <l n="9017">Felt less remorse : they , forthwith to the place</l>
     <l n="9018">Repairing where he judged them , prostrate fell</l>
     <l n="9019">Before him reverent ; and both confessed</l>
     <l n="9020">Humbly their faults , and pardon begged ; with tears</l>
     <l n="9021">Watering the ground , and with their sighs the air</l>
     <l n="9022">Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign</l>

     <l n="9025">Thus they , in lowliest plight , repentant stood</l>
     <l n="9026">Praying ; for from the mercy-seat above</l>
     <l n="9027">Prevenient grace descending had removed</l>
     <l n="9028">The stony from their hearts , and made new flesh</l>
     <l n="9029">Regenerate grow instead ; that sighs now breathed</l>
     <l n="9030">Unutterable ; which the Spirit of prayer</l>
     <l n="9031">Inspired , and winged for Heaven with speedier flight</l>
     <l n="9032">Than loudest oratory : Yet their port</l>
     <l n="9033">Not of mean suitors ; nor important less</l>
     <l n="9034">Seemed their petition , than when the ancient pair</l>

     <l n="9036">Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha , to restore</l>
     <l n="9037">The race of mankind drowned , before the shrine</l>
     <l n="9038">Of Themis stood devout . To Heaven their prayers</l>
     <l n="9039">Flew up , nor missed the way , by envious winds</l>
     <l n="9040">Blown vagabond or frustrate : in they passed</l>
     <l n="9041">Dimensionless through heavenly doors ; then clad</l>
     <l n="9042">With incense , where the golden altar fumed ,</l>
     <l n="9043">By their great intercessour , came in sight</l>
     <l n="9044">Before the Father 's throne : them the glad Son</l>

     <l n="9047">From thy implanted grace in Man ; these sighs</l>
     <l n="9048">And prayers , which in this golden censer mixed</l>

     <l n="9050">Fruits of more pleasing savour , from thy seed</l>

     <l n="9066">To better life shall yield him : where with me</l>
     <l n="9067">All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss ;</l>
     <l n="9068">Made one with me , as I with thee am one .</l>
     <l n="9069">To whom the Father , without cloud , serene .</l>
     <l n="9070">All thy request for Man , accepted Son ,</l>
     <l n="9071">Obtain ; all thy request was my decree :</l>
     <l n="9072">But , longer in that Paradise to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="9073">The law I gave to Nature him forbids :</l>
     <l n="9074">Those pure immortal elements , that know ,</l>
     <l n="9075">No gross , no unharmonious mixture foul ,</l>
     <l n="9076">Eject him , tainted now ; and purge him off ,</l>
     <l n="9077">As a distemper , gross , to air as gross ,</l>
     <l n="9078">And mortal food ; as may dispose him best</l>
     <l n="9079">For dissolution wrought by sin , that first</l>
     <l n="9080">Distempered all things , and of incorrupt</l>
     <l n="9081">Corrupted . I , at first , with two fair gifts</l>
     <l n="9082">Created him endowed ; with happiness ,</l>
     <l n="9083">And immortality : that fondly lost ,</l>
     <l n="9084">This other served but to eternize woe ;</l>
     <l n="9085">Till I provided death : so death becomes</l>
     <l n="9086">His final remedy ; and , after life ,</l>
     <l n="9087">Tried in sharp tribulation , and refined</l>
     <l n="9088">By faith and faithful works , to second life ,</l>
     <l n="9089">Waked in the renovation of the just ,</l>
     <l n="9090">Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed .</l>
     <l n="9091">But let us call to synod all the Blest ,</l>
     <l n="9092">Through Heaven 's wide bounds : from them I will not hide</l>
     <l n="9093">My judgements ; how with mankind I proceed ,</l>
     <l n="9094">As how with peccant Angels late they saw ,</l>
     <l n="9095">And in their state , though firm , stood more confirmed .</l>
     <l n="9096">He ended , and the Son gave signal high</l>
     <l n="9097">To the bright minister that watched ; he blew</l>
     <l n="9098">His trumpet , heard in Oreb since perhaps</l>
     <l n="9099">When God descended , and perhaps once more</l>
     <l n="9100">To sound at general doom . The angelick blast</l>
     <l n="9101">Filled all the regions : from their blisful bowers</l>
     <l n="9102">Of amarantine shade , fountain or spring ,</l>
     <l n="9103">By the waters of life , where'er they sat</l>
     <l n="9104">In fellowships of joy , the sons of light</l>
     <l n="9105">Hasted , resorting to the summons high ;</l>
     <l n="9106">And took their seats ; till from his throne supreme</l>
     <l n="9107">The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will .</l>
     <l n="9108">O Sons , like one of us Man is become</l>
     <l n="9109">To know both good and evil , since his taste</l>
     <l n="9110">Of that defended fruit ; but let him boast</l>
     <l n="9111">His knowledge of good lost , and evil got ;</l>
     <l n="9112">Happier ! had it sufficed him to have known</l>
     <l n="9113">Good by itself , and evil not at all .</l>
     <l n="9114">He sorrows now , repents , and prays contrite ,</l>
     <l n="9115">My motions in him ; longer than they move ,</l>
     <l n="9116">His heart I know , how variable and vain ,</l>
     <l n="9117">Self-left . Lest therefore his now bolder hand</l>
     <l n="9118">Reach also of the tree of life , and eat ,</l>
     <l n="9119">And live for ever , dream at least to live</l>
     <l n="9120">For ever , to remove him I decree ,</l>
     <l n="9121">And send him from the garden forth to till</l>
     <l n="9122">The ground whence he was taken , fitter soil .</l>
     <l n="9123">Michael , this my behest have thou in charge ;</l>
     <l n="9124">Take to thee from among the Cherubim</l>
     <l n="9125">Thy choice of flaming warriours , lest the Fiend ,</l>
     <l n="9126">Or in behalf of Man , or to invade</l>
     <l n="9127">Vacant possession , some new trouble raise :</l>
     <l n="9128">Haste thee , and from the Paradise of God</l>
     <l n="9129">Without remorse drive out the sinful pair ;</l>
     <l n="9130">From hallowed ground the unholy ; and denounce</l>
     <l n="9131">To them , and to their progeny , from thence</l>
     <l n="9132">Perpetual banishment . Yet , lest they faint</l>
     <l n="9133">At the sad sentence rigorously urged ,</l>
     <l n="9134">( For I behold them softened , and with tears</l>
     <l n="9135">Bewailing their excess ,) all terrour hide .</l>
     <l n="9136">If patiently thy bidding they obey ,</l>
     <l n="9137">Dismiss them not disconsolate ; reveal</l>
     <l n="9138">To Adam what shall come in future days ,</l>
     <l n="9139">As I shall thee enlighten ; intermix</l>
     <l n="9140">My covenant in the Woman 's seed renewed ;</l>
     <l n="9141">So send them forth , though sorrowing , yet in peace :</l>
     <l n="9142">And on the east side of the garden place ,</l>
     <l n="9143">Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs ,</l>
     <l n="9144">Cherubick watch ; and of a sword the flame</l>
     <l n="9145">Wide-waving ; all approach far off to fright ,</l>
     <l n="9146">And guard all passage to the tree of life :</l>
     <l n="9147">Lest Paradise a receptacle prove</l>
     <l n="9148">To Spirits foul , and all my trees their prey ;</l>
     <l n="9149">With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude .</l>
     <l n="9150">He ceased ; and the arch-angelick Power prepared</l>
     <l n="9151">For swift descent ; with him the cohort bright</l>
     <l n="9152">Of watchful Cherubim : four faces each</l>
     <l n="9153">Had , like a double Janus ; all their shape</l>
     <l n="9154">Spangled with eyes more numerous than those</l>
     <l n="9155">Of Argus , and more wakeful than to drouse ,</l>
     <l n="9156">Charmed with Arcadian pipe , the pastoral reed</l>
     <l n="9157">Of Hermes , or his opiate rod . Mean while ,</l>
     <l n="9158">To re-salute the world with sacred light ,</l>
     <l n="9159">Leucothea waked ; and with fresh dews imbalmed</l>
     <l n="9160">The earth ; when Adam and first matron Eve</l>
     <l n="9161">Had ended now their orisons , and found</l>
     <l n="9162">Strength added from above ; new hope to spring</l>
     <l n="9163">Out of despair ; joy , but with fear yet linked ;</l>
     <l n="9164">Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed .</l>
     <l n="9165">Eve , easily my faith admit , that all</l>
     <l n="9166">The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends ;</l>
     <l n="9167">But , that from us aught should ascend to Heaven</l>
     <l n="9168">So prevalent as to concern the mind</l>
     <l n="9169">Of God high-blest , or to incline his will ,</l>
     <l n="9170">Hard to belief may seem ; yet this will prayer</l>
     <l n="9171">Or one short sigh of human breath , upborne</l>
     <l n="9172">Even to the seat of God . For since I sought</l>
     <l n="9173">By prayer the offended Deity to appease ;</l>
     <l n="9174">Kneeled , and before him humbled all my heart ;</l>
     <l n="9175">Methought I saw him placable and mild ,</l>
     <l n="9176">Bending his ear ; persuasion in me grew</l>
     <l n="9177">That I was heard with favour ; peace returned</l>
     <l n="9178">Home to my breast , and to my memory</l>
     <l n="9179">His promise , that thy seed shall bruise our foe ;</l>
     <l n="9180">Which , then not minded in dismay , yet now</l>
     <l n="9181">Assures me that the bitterness of death</l>
     <l n="9182">Is past , and we shall live . Whence hail to thee ,</l>
     <l n="9183">Eve rightly called , mother of all mankind ,</l>
     <l n="9184">Mother of all things living , since by thee</l>
     <l n="9185">Man is to live ; and all things live for Man .</l>
     <l n="9186">To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek .</l>
     <l n="9187">Ill-worthy I such title should belong</l>
     <l n="9188">To me transgressour ; who , for thee ordained</l>
     <l n="9189">A help , became thy snare ; to me reproach</l>
     <l n="9190">Rather belongs , distrust , and all dispraise :</l>
     <l n="9191">But infinite in pardon was my Judge ,</l>
     <l n="9192">That I , who first brought death on all , am graced</l>
     <l n="9193">The source of life ; next favourable thou ,</l>
     <l n="9194">Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st ,</l>
     <l n="9195">Far other name deserving . But the field</l>
     <l n="9196">To labour calls us , now with sweat imposed ,</l>
     <l n="9197">Though after sleepless night ; for see ! the morn ,</l>
     <l n="9198">All unconcerned with our unrest , begins</l>
     <l n="9199">Her rosy progress smiling : let us forth ;</l>
     <l n="9200">I never from thy side henceforth to stray ,</l>
     <l n="9201">Where'er our day 's work lies , though now enjoined</l>
     <l n="9202">Laborious , till day droop ; while here we dwell ,</l>
     <l n="9203">What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks ?</l>
     <l n="9204">Here let us live , though in fallen state , content .</l>
     <l n="9205">So spake , so wished much humbled Eve ; but Fate</l>
     <l n="9206">Subscribed not : Nature first gave signs , impressed</l>
     <l n="9207">On bird , beast , air ; air suddenly eclipsed ,</l>
     <l n="9208">After short blush of morn ; nigh in her sight</l>
     <l n="9209">The bird of Jove , stooped from his aery tour ,</l>
     <l n="9210">Two birds of gayest plume before him drove ;</l>
     <l n="9211">Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods ,</l>
     <l n="9212">First hunter then , pursued a gentle brace ,</l>
     <l n="9213">Goodliest of all the forest , hart and hind ;</l>
     <l n="9214">Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight .</l>
     <l n="9215">Adam observed , and with his eye the chase</l>
     <l n="9216">Pursuing , not unmoved , to Eve thus spake .</l>
     <l n="9217">O Eve , some further change awaits us nigh ,</l>
     <l n="9218">Which Heaven , by these mute signs in Nature , shows</l>
     <l n="9219">Forerunners of his purpose ; or to warn</l>
     <l n="9220">Us , haply too secure , of our discharge</l>
     <l n="9221">From penalty , because from death released</l>
     <l n="9222">Some days : how long , and what till then our life ,</l>
     <l n="9223">Who knows ? or more than this , that we are dust ,</l>
     <l n="9224">And thither must return , and be no more ?</l>
     <l n="9225">Why else this double object in our sight</l>
     <l n="9226">Of flight pursued in the air , and o'er the ground ,</l>
     <l n="9227">One way the self-same hour ? why in the east</l>
     <l n="9228">Darkness ere day 's mid-course , and morning-light</l>
     <l n="9229">More orient in yon western cloud , that draws</l>
     <l n="9230">O'er the blue firmament a radiant white ,</l>
     <l n="9231">And slow descends with something heavenly fraught ?</l>
     <l n="9232">He erred not ; for by this the heavenly bands</l>
     <l n="9233">Down from a sky of jasper lighted now</l>
     <l n="9234">In Paradise , and on a hill made halt ;</l>
     <l n="9235">A glorious apparition , had not doubt</l>
     <l n="9236">And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam 's eye .</l>
     <l n="9237">Not that more glorious , when the Angels met</l>
     <l n="9238">Jacob in Mahanaim , where he saw</l>
     <l n="9239">The field pavilioned with his guardians bright ;</l>
     <l n="9240">Nor that , which on the flaming mount appeared</l>
     <l n="9241">In Dothan , covered with a camp of fire ,</l>
     <l n="9242">Against the Syrian king , who to surprise</l>
     <l n="9243">One man , assassin-like , had levied war ,</l>
     <l n="9244">War unproclaimed . The princely Hierarch</l>
     <l n="9245">In their bright stand there left his Powers , to seise</l>
     <l n="9246">Possession of the garden ; he alone ,</l>
     <l n="9247">To find where Adam sheltered , took his way ,</l>
     <l n="9248">Not unperceived of Adam ; who to Eve ,</l>
     <l n="9249">While the great visitant approached , thus spake .</l>
     <l n="9250">Eve , now expect great tidings , which perhaps</l>
     <l n="9251">Of us will soon determine , or impose</l>
     <l n="9252">New laws to be observed ; for I descry ,</l>
     <l n="9253">From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill ,</l>
     <l n="9254">One of the heavenly host ; and , by his gait ,</l>
     <l n="9255">None of the meanest ; some great Potentate</l>
     <l n="9256">Or of the Thrones above ; such majesty</l>
     <l n="9257">Invests him coming ! yet not terrible ,</l>
     <l n="9258">That I should fear ; nor sociably mild ,</l>
     <l n="9259">As Raphael , that I should much confide ;</l>
     <l n="9260">But solemn and sublime ; whom not to offend ,</l>
     <l n="9261">With reverence I must meet , and thou retire .</l>
     <l n="9262">He ended : and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh ,</l>
     <l n="9263">Not in his shape celestial , but as man</l>
     <l n="9264">Clad to meet man ; over his lucid arms</l>
     <l n="9265">A military vest of purple flowed ,</l>
     <l n="9266">Livelier than Meliboean , or the grain</l>
     <l n="9267">Of Sarra , worn by kings and heroes old</l>
     <l n="9268">In time of truce ; Iris had dipt the woof ;</l>
     <l n="9269">His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime</l>
     <l n="9270">In manhood where youth ended ; by his side ,</l>
     <l n="9271">As in a glistering zodiack , hung the sword ,</l>
     <l n="9272">Satan 's dire dread ; and in his hand the spear .</l>
     <l n="9273">Adam bowed low ; he , kingly , from his state</l>
     <l n="9274">Inclined not , but his coming thus declared .</l>
     <l n="9275">Adam , Heaven 's high behest no preface needs :</l>
     <l n="9276">Sufficient that thy prayers are heard ; and Death ,</l>
     <l n="9277">Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress ,</l>
     <l n="9278">Defeated of his seisure many days</l>
     <l n="9279">Given thee of grace ; wherein thou mayest repent ,</l>
     <l n="9280">And one bad act with many deeds well done</l>
     <l n="9281">Mayest cover : Well may then thy Lord , appeased ,</l>
     <l n="9282">Redeem thee quite from Death 's rapacious claim ;</l>
     <l n="9283">But longer in this Paradise to dwell</l>
     <l n="9284">Permits not : to remove thee I am come ,</l>
     <l n="9285">And send thee from the garden forth to till</l>
     <l n="9286">The ground whence thou wast taken , fitter soil .</l>
     <l n="9287">He added not ; for Adam at the news</l>
     <l n="9288">Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood ,</l>
     <l n="9289">That all his senses bound ; Eve , who unseen</l>
     <l n="9290">Yet all had heard , with audible lament</l>
     <l n="9291">Discovered soon the place of her retire .</l>
     <l n="9292">O unexpected stroke , worse than of Death !</l>
     <l n="9293">Must I thus leave thee Paradise ? thus leave</l>
     <l n="9294">Thee , native soil ! these happy walks and shades ,</l>
     <l n="9295">Fit haunt of Gods ? where I had hope to spend ,</l>
     <l n="9296">Quiet though sad , the respite of that day</l>
     <l n="9297">That must be mortal to us both . O flowers ,</l>
     <l n="9298">That never will in other climate grow ,</l>
     <l n="9299">My early visitation , and my last</l>
     <l n="9300">At even , which I bred up with tender hand</l>
     <l n="9301">From the first opening bud , and gave ye names ,</l>
     <l n="9302">Who now shall rear ye to the sun , or rank</l>
     <l n="9303">Your tribes , and water from the ambrosial fount ?</l>
     <l n="9304">Thee lastly , nuptial bower ! by me adorned</l>
     <l n="9305">With what to sight or smell was sweet ! from thee</l>
     <l n="9306">How shall I part , and whither wander down</l>
     <l n="9307">Into a lower world ; to this obscure</l>
     <l n="9308">And wild , how shall we breathe in other air</l>
     <l n="9309">Less pure , accustomed to immortal fruits ?</l>
     <l n="9310">Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild .</l>
     <l n="9311">Lament not , Eve , but patiently resign</l>
     <l n="9312">What justly thou hast lost , nor set thy heart ,</l>
     <l n="9313">Thus over-fond , on that which is not thine :</l>
     <l n="9314">Thy going is not lonely ; with thee goes</l>
     <l n="9315">Thy husband ; whom to follow thou art bound ;</l>
     <l n="9316">Where he abides , think there thy native soil .</l>
     <l n="9317">Adam , by this from the cold sudden damp</l>
     <l n="9318">Recovering , and his scattered spirits returned ,</l>
     <l n="9319">To Michael thus his humble words addressed .</l>
     <l n="9320">Celestial , whether among the Thrones , or named</l>
     <l n="9321">Of them the highest ; for such of shape may seem</l>
     <l n="9322">Prince above princes ! gently hast thou told</l>
     <l n="9323">Thy message , which might else in telling wound ,</l>
     <l n="9324">And in performing end us ; what besides</l>
     <l n="9325">Of sorrow , and dejection , and despair ,</l>
     <l n="9326">Our frailty can sustain , thy tidings bring ,</l>
     <l n="9327">Departure from this happy place , our sweet</l>
     <l n="9328">Recess , and only consolation left</l>
     <l n="9329">Familiar to our eyes ! all places else</l>
     <l n="9330">Inhospitable appear , and desolate ;</l>
     <l n="9331">Nor knowing us , nor known : And , if by prayer</l>
     <l n="9332">Incessant I could hope to change the will</l>
     <l n="9333">Of Him who all things can , I would not cease</l>
     <l n="9334">To weary him with my assiduous cries :</l>
     <l n="9335">But prayer against his absolute decree</l>
     <l n="9336">No more avails than breath against the wind ,</l>
     <l n="9337">Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth :</l>
     <l n="9338">Therefore to his great bidding I submit .</l>
     <l n="9339">This most afflicts me , that , departing hence ,</l>
     <l n="9340">As from his face I shall be hid , deprived</l>
     <l n="9341">His blessed countenance : Here I could frequent</l>
     <l n="9342">With worship place by place where he vouchsafed</l>
     <l n="9343">Presence Divine ; and to my sons relate ,</l>
     <l n="9344">On this mount he appeared ; under this tree</l>
     <l n="9345">Stood visible ; among these pines his voice</l>
     <l n="9346">I heard ; here with him at this fountain talked :</l>
     <l n="9347">So many grateful altars I would rear</l>
     <l n="9348">Of grassy turf , and pile up every stone</l>
     <l n="9349">Of lustre from the brook , in memory ,</l>
     <l n="9350">Or monument to ages ; and theron</l>
     <l n="9351">Offer sweet-smelling gums , and fruits , and flowers :</l>
     <l n="9352">In yonder nether world where shall I seek</l>
     <l n="9353">His bright appearances , or foot-step trace ?</l>
     <l n="9354">For though I fled him angry , yet recalled</l>
     <l n="9355">To life prolonged and promised race , I now</l>
     <l n="9356">Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts</l>
     <l n="9357">Of glory ; and far off his steps adore .</l>
     <l n="9358">To whom thus Michael with regard benign .</l>
     <l n="9359">Adam , thou knowest Heaven his , and all the Earth ;</l>
     <l n="9360">Not this rock only ; his Omnipresence fills</l>
     <l n="9361">Land , sea , and air , and every kind that lives ,</l>
     <l n="9362">Fomented by his virtual power and warmed :</l>
     <l n="9363">All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule ,</l>
     <l n="9364">No despicable gift ; surmise not then</l>
     <l n="9365">His presence to these narrow bounds confined</l>
     <l n="9366">Of Paradise , or Eden : this had been</l>
     <l n="9367">Perhaps thy capital seat , from whence had spread</l>
     <l n="9368">All generations ; and had hither come</l>
     <l n="9369">From all the ends of the earth , to celebrate</l>
     <l n="9370">And reverence thee , their great progenitor .</l>
     <l n="9371">But this pre-eminence thou hast lost , brought down</l>
     <l n="9372">To dwell on even ground now with thy sons :</l>
     <l n="9373">Yet doubt not but in valley , and in plain ,</l>
     <l n="9374">God is , as here ; and will be found alike</l>
     <l n="9375">Present ; and of his presence many a sign</l>
     <l n="9376">Still following thee , still compassing thee round</l>
     <l n="9377">With goodness and paternal love , his face</l>
     <l n="9378">Express , and of his steps the track divine .</l>
     <l n="9379">Which that thou mayest believe , and be confirmed</l>
     <l n="9380">Ere thou from hence depart ; know , I am sent</l>
     <l n="9381">To show thee what shall come in future days</l>
     <l n="9382">To thee , and to thy offspring : good with bad</l>
     <l n="9383">Expect to hear ; supernal grace contending</l>
     <l n="9384">With sinfulness of men ; thereby to learn</l>
     <l n="9385">True patience , and to temper joy with fear</l>
     <l n="9386">And pious sorrow ; equally inured</l>
     <l n="9387">By moderation either state to bear ,</l>
     <l n="9388">Prosperous or adverse : so shalt thou lead</l>
     <l n="9389">Safest thy life , and best prepared endure</l>
     <l n="9390">Thy mortal passage when it comes .— Ascend</l>
     <l n="9391">This hill ; let Eve ( for I have drenched her eyes )</l>
     <l n="9392">Here sleep below ; while thou to foresight wakest ;</l>
     <l n="9393">As once thou sleptst , while she to life was formed .</l>
     <l n="9394">To whom thus Adam gratefully replied .</l>
     <l n="9395">Ascend , I follow thee , safe Guide , the path</l>
     <l n="9396">Thou leadest me ; and to the hand of Heaven submit ,</l>
     <l n="9397">However chastening ; to the evil turn</l>
     <l n="9398">My obvious breast ; arming to overcome</l>
     <l n="9399">By suffering , and earn rest from labour won ,</l>
     <l n="9400">If so I may attain .— So both ascend</l>
     <l n="9401">In the visions of God . It was a hill ,</l>
     <l n="9402">Of Paradise the highest ; from whose top</l>
     <l n="9403">The hemisphere of earth , in clearest ken ,</l>
     <l n="9404">Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay .</l>
     <l n="9405">Not higher that hill , nor wider looking round ,</l>
     <l n="9406">Whereon , for different cause , the Tempter set</l>
     <l n="9407">Our second Adam , in the wilderness ;</l>
     <l n="9408">To show him all Earth 's kingdoms , and their glory .</l>
     <l n="9409">His eye might there command wherever stood</l>
     <l n="9410">City of old or modern fame , the seat</l>
     <l n="9411">Of mightiest empire , from the destined walls</l>
     <l n="9412">Of Cambalu , seat of Cathaian Can ,</l>
     <l n="9413">And Samarchand by Oxus , Temir 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="9414">To Paquin of Sinaean kings ; and thence</l>
     <l n="9415">To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul ,</l>
     <l n="9416">Down to the golden Chersonese ; or where</l>
     <l n="9417">The Persian in Ecbatan sat , or since</l>
     <l n="9418">In Hispahan ; or where the Russian Ksar</l>
     <l n="9419">In Mosco ; or the Sultan in Bizance ,</l>
     <l n="9420">Turchestan-born ; nor could his eye not ken</l>
     <l n="9421">The empire of Negus to his utmost port</l>
     <l n="9422">Ercoco , and the less maritim kings</l>
     <l n="9423">Mombaza , and Quiloa , and Melind ,</l>
     <l n="9424">And Sofala , thought Ophir , to the realm</l>
     <l n="9425">Of Congo , and Angola farthest south ;</l>
     <l n="9426">Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount</l>
     <l n="9427">The kingdoms of Almansor , Fez and Sus ,</l>
     <l n="9428">Morocco , and Algiers , and Tremisen ;</l>
     <l n="9429">On Europe thence , and where Rome was to sway</l>
     <l n="9430">The world : in spirit perhaps he also saw</l>
     <l n="9431">Rich Mexico , the seat of Montezume ,</l>
     <l n="9432">And Cusco in Peru , the richer seat</l>
     <l n="9433">Of Atabalipa ; and yet unspoiled</l>
     <l n="9434">Guiana , whose great city Geryon 's sons</l>
     <l n="9435">Call El Dorado . But to nobler sights</l>
     <l n="9436">Michael from Adam 's eyes the film removed ,</l>
     <l n="9437">Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight</l>
     <l n="9438">Had bred ; then purged with euphrasy and rue</l>
     <l n="9439">The visual nerve , for he had much to see ;</l>
     <l n="9440">And from the well of life three drops instilled .</l>
     <l n="9441">So deep the power of these ingredients pierced ,</l>
     <l n="9442">Even to the inmost seat of mental sight ,</l>
     <l n="9443">That Adam , now enforced to close his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="9444">Sunk down , and all his spirits became entranced ;</l>
     <l n="9445">But him the gentle Angel by the hand</l>
     <l n="9446">Soon raised , and his attention thus recalled .</l>
     <l n="9447">Adam , now ope thine eyes ; and first behold</l>
     <l n="9448">The effects , which thy original crime hath wrought</l>
     <l n="9449">In some to spring from thee ; who never touched</l>
     <l n="9450">The excepted tree ; nor with the snake conspired ;</l>
     <l n="9451">Nor sinned thy sin ; yet from that sin derive</l>
     <l n="9452">Corruption , to bring forth more violent deeds .</l>
     <l n="9453">His eyes he opened , and beheld a field ,</l>
     <l n="9454">Part arable and tilth , whereon were sheaves</l>
     <l n="9455">New reaped ; the other part sheep-walks and folds ;</l>
     <l n="9456">I ’ the midst an altar as the land-mark stood ,</l>
     <l n="9457">Rustick , of grassy sord ; thither anon</l>
     <l n="9458">A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought</l>
     <l n="9459">First fruits , the green ear , and the yellow sheaf ,</l>
     <l n="9460">Unculled , as came to hand ; a shepherd next ,</l>
     <l n="9461">More meek , came with the firstlings of his flock ,</l>
     <l n="9462">Choicest and best ; then , sacrificing , laid</l>
     <l n="9463">The inwards and their fat , with incense strowed ,</l>
     <l n="9464">On the cleft wood , and all due rights performed :</l>
     <l n="9465">His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven</l>
     <l n="9466">Consumed with nimble glance , and grateful steam ;</l>
     <l n="9467">The other 's not , for his was not sincere ;</l>
     <l n="9468">Whereat he inly raged , and , as they talked ,</l>
     <l n="9469">Smote him into the midriff with a stone</l>
     <l n="9470">That beat out life ; he fell ; and , deadly pale ,</l>
     <l n="9471">Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused .</l>
     <l n="9472">Much at that sight was Adam in his heart</l>
     <l n="9473">Dismayed , and thus in haste to the Angel cried .</l>
     <l n="9474">O Teacher , some great mischief hath befallen</l>
     <l n="9475">To that meek man , who well had sacrificed ;</l>
     <l n="9476">Is piety thus and pure devotion paid ?</l>
     <l n="9477">To whom Michael thus , he also moved , replied .</l>
     <l n="9478">These two are brethren , Adam , and to come</l>
     <l n="9479">Out of thy loins ; the unjust the just hath slain ,</l>
     <l n="9480">For envy that his brother 's offering found</l>
     <l n="9481">From Heaven acceptance ; but the bloody fact</l>
     <l n="9482">Will be avenged ; and the other 's faith , approved ,</l>
     <l n="9483">Lose no reward ; though here thou see him die ,</l>
     <l n="9484">Rolling in dust and gore . To which our sire .</l>
     <l n="9485">Alas ! both for the deed , and for the cause !</l>
     <l n="9486">But have I now seen Death ? Is this the way</l>
     <l n="9487">I must return to native dust ? O sight</l>
     <l n="9488">Of terrour , foul and ugly to behold ,</l>
     <l n="9489">Horrid to think , how horrible to feel !</l>
     <l n="9490">To whom thus Michael . Death thou hast seen</l>
     <l n="9491">In his first shape on Man ; but many shapes</l>
     <l n="9492">Of Death , and many are the ways that lead</l>
     <l n="9493">To his grim cave , all dismal ; yet to sense</l>
     <l n="9494">More terrible at the entrance , than within .</l>
     <l n="9495">Some , as thou sawest , by violent stroke shall die ;</l>
     <l n="9496">By fire , flood , famine , by intemperance more</l>
     <l n="9497">In meats and drinks , which on the earth shall bring</l>
     <l n="9498">Diseases dire , of which a monstrous crew</l>
     <l n="9499">Before thee shall appear ; that thou mayest know</l>
     <l n="9500">What misery the inabstinence of Eve</l>
     <l n="9501">Shall bring on Men . Immediately a place</l>
     <l n="9502">Before his eyes appeared , sad , noisome , dark ;</l>
     <l n="9503">A lazar-house it seemed ; wherein were laid</l>
     <l n="9504">Numbers of all diseased ; all maladies</l>
     <l n="9505">Of ghastly spasm , or racking torture , qualms</l>
     <l n="9506">Of heart-sick agony , all feverous kinds ,</l>
     <l n="9507">Convulsions , epilepsies , fierce catarrhs ,</l>
     <l n="9508">Intestine stone and ulcer , colick-pangs ,</l>
     <l n="9509">Demoniack phrenzy , moaping melancholy ,</l>
     <l n="9510">And moon-struck madness , pining atrophy ,</l>
     <l n="9511">Marasmus , and wide-wasting pestilence ,</l>
     <l n="9512">Dropsies , and asthmas , and joint-racking rheums .</l>
     <l n="9513">Dire was the tossing , deep the groans ; Despair</l>
     <l n="9514">Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch ;</l>
     <l n="9515">And over them triumphant Death his dart</l>
     <l n="9516">Shook , but delayed to strike , though oft invoked</l>
     <l n="9517">With vows , as their chief good , and final hope .</l>
     <l n="9518">Sight so deform what heart of rock could long</l>
     <l n="9519">Dry-eyed behold ? Adam could not , but wept ,</l>
     <l n="9520">Though not of woman born ; compassion quelled</l>
     <l n="9521">His best of man , and gave him up to tears</l>
     <l n="9522">A space , till firmer thoughts restrained excess ;</l>
     <l n="9523">And , scarce recovering words , his plaint renewed .</l>
     <l n="9524">O miserable mankind , to what fall</l>
     <l n="9525">Degraded , to what wretched state reserved !</l>
     <l n="9526">Better end here unborn . Why is life given</l>
     <l n="9527">To be thus wrested from us ? rather , why</l>
     <l n="9528">Obtruded on us thus ? who , if we knew</l>
     <l n="9529">What we receive , would either no accept</l>
     <l n="9530">Life offered , or soon beg to lay it down ;</l>
     <l n="9531">Glad to be so dismissed in peace . Can thus</l>
     <l n="9532">The image of God in Man , created once</l>
     <l n="9533">So goodly and erect , though faulty since ,</l>
     <l n="9534">To such unsightly sufferings be debased</l>
     <l n="9535">Under inhuman pains ? Why should not Man ,</l>
     <l n="9536">Retaining still divine similitude</l>
     <l n="9537">In part , from such deformities be free ,</l>
     <l n="9538">And , for his Maker 's image sake , exempt ?</l>
     <l n="9539">Their Maker 's image , answered Michael , then</l>
     <l n="9540">Forsook them , when themselves they vilified</l>
     <l n="9541">To serve ungoverned Appetite ; and took</l>
     <l n="9542">His image whom they served , a brutish vice ,</l>
     <l n="9543">Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve .</l>
     <l n="9544">Therefore so abject is their punishment ,</l>
     <l n="9545">Disfiguring not God 's likeness , but their own ;</l>
     <l n="9546">Or if his likeness , by themselves defaced ;</l>
     <l n="9547">While they pervert pure Nature 's healthful rules</l>
     <l n="9548">To loathsome sickness ; worthily , since they</l>
     <l n="9549">God 's image did not reverence in themselves .</l>
     <l n="9550">I yield it just , said Adam , and submit .</l>
     <l n="9551">But is there yet no other way , besides</l>
     <l n="9552">These painful passages , how we may come</l>
     <l n="9553">To death , and mix with our connatural dust ?</l>
     <l n="9554">There is , said Michael , if thou well observe</l>
     <l n="9555">The rule of Not too much ; by temperance taught ,</l>
     <l n="9556">In what thou eatest and drinkest ; seeking from thence</l>
     <l n="9557">Due nourishment , not gluttonous delight ,</l>
     <l n="9558">Till many years over thy head return :</l>
     <l n="9559">So mayest thou live ; till , like ripe fruit , thou drop</l>
     <l n="9560">Into thy mother 's lap ; or be with ease</l>
     <l n="9561">Gathered , nor harshly plucked ; for death mature :</l>
     <l n="9562">This is Old Age ; but then , thou must outlive</l>
     <l n="9563">Thy youth , thy strength , thy beauty ; which will change</l>
     <l n="9564">To withered , weak , and gray ; thy senses then ,</l>
     <l n="9565">Obtuse , all taste of pleasure must forego ,</l>
     <l n="9566">To what thou hast ; and , for the air of youth ,</l>
     <l n="9567">Hopeful and cheerful , in thy blood will reign</l>
     <l n="9568">A melancholy damp of cold and dry</l>
     <l n="9569">To weigh thy spirits down , and last consume</l>
     <l n="9570">The balm of life . To whom our ancestor .</l>
     <l n="9571">Henceforth I fly not death , nor would prolong</l>
     <l n="9572">Life much ; bent rather , how I may be quit ,</l>
     <l n="9573">Fairest and easiest , of this cumbrous charge ;</l>
     <l n="9574">Which I must keep till my appointed day</l>
     <l n="9575">Of rendering up , and patiently attend</l>
     <l n="9576">My dissolution . Michael replied .</l>
     <l n="9577">Nor love thy life , nor hate ; but what thou livest</l>
     <l n="9578">Live well ; how long , or short , permit to Heaven :</l>
     <l n="9579">And now prepare thee for another sight .</l>
     <l n="9580">He looked , and saw a spacious plain , whereon</l>
     <l n="9581">Were tents of various hue ; by some , were herds</l>
     <l n="9582">Of cattle grazing ; others , whence the sound</l>
     <l n="9583">Of instruments , that made melodious chime ,</l>
     <l n="9584">Was heard , of harp and organ ; and , who moved</l>
     <l n="9585">Their stops and chords , was seen ; his volant touch ,</l>
     <l n="9586">Instinct through all proportions , low and high ,</l>
     <l n="9587">Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue .</l>
     <l n="9588">In other part stood one who , at the forge</l>
     <l n="9589">Labouring , two massy clods of iron and brass</l>
     <l n="9590">Had melted , ( whether found where casual fire</l>
     <l n="9591">Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale ,</l>
     <l n="9592">Down to the veins of earth ; thence gliding hot</l>
     <l n="9593">To some cave 's mouth ; or whether washed by stream</l>
     <l n="9594">From underground ;) the liquid ore he drained</l>
     <l n="9595">Into fit moulds prepared ; from which he formed</l>
     <l n="9596">First his own tools ; then , what might else be wrought</l>
     <l n="9597">Fusil or graven in metal . After these ,</l>
     <l n="9598">But on the hither side , a different sort</l>
     <l n="9599">From the high neighbouring hills , which was their seat ,</l>
     <l n="9600">Down to the plain descended ; by their guise</l>
     <l n="9601">Just men they seemed , and all their study bent</l>
     <l n="9602">To worship God aright , and know his works</l>
     <l n="9603">Not hid ; nor those things last , which might preserve</l>
     <l n="9604">Freedom and peace to Men ; they on the plain</l>
     <l n="9605">Long had not walked , when from the tents , behold !</l>
     <l n="9606">A bevy of fair women , richly gay</l>
     <l n="9607">In gems and wanton dress ; to the harp they sung</l>
     <l n="9608">Soft amorous ditties , and in dance came on :</l>
     <l n="9609">The men , though grave , eyed them ; and let their eyes</l>
     <l n="9610">Rove without rein ; till , in the amorous net</l>
     <l n="9611">Fast caught , they liked ; and each his liking chose ;</l>
     <l n="9612">And now of love they treat , till the evening-star ,</l>
     <l n="9613">Love 's harbinger , appeared ; then , all in heat</l>
     <l n="9614">They light the nuptial torch , and bid invoke</l>
     <l n="9615">Hymen , then first to marriage rites invoked :</l>
     <l n="9616">With feast and musick all the tents resound .</l>
     <l n="9617">Such happy interview , and fair event</l>
     <l n="9618">Of love and youth not lost , songs , garlands , flowers ,</l>
     <l n="9619">And charming symphonies , attached the heart</l>
     <l n="9620">Of Adam , soon inclined to admit delight ,</l>
     <l n="9621">The bent of nature ; which he thus expressed .</l>
     <l n="9622">True opener of mine eyes , prime Angel blest ;</l>
     <l n="9623">Much better seems this vision , and more hope</l>
     <l n="9624">Of peaceful days portends , than those two past ;</l>
     <l n="9625">Those were of hate and death , or pain much worse ;</l>
     <l n="9626">Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends .</l>
     <l n="9627">To whom thus Michael . Judge not what is best</l>
     <l n="9628">By pleasure , though to nature seeming meet ;</l>
     <l n="9629">Created , as thou art , to nobler end</l>
     <l n="9630">Holy and pure , conformity divine .</l>
     <l n="9631">Those tents thou sawest so pleasant , were the tents</l>
     <l n="9632">Of wickedness , wherein shall dwell his race</l>
     <l n="9633">Who slew his brother ; studious they appear</l>
     <l n="9634">Of arts that polish life , inventers rare ;</l>
     <l n="9635">Unmindful of their Maker , though his Spirit</l>
     <l n="9636">Taught them ; but they his gifts acknowledged none .</l>
     <l n="9637">Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget ;</l>
     <l n="9638">For that fair female troop thou sawest , that seemed</l>
     <l n="9639">Of Goddesses , so blithe , so smooth , so gay ,</l>
     <l n="9640">Yet empty of all good wherein consists</l>
     <l n="9641">Woman 's domestick honour and chief praise ;</l>
     <l n="9642">Bred only and completed to the taste</l>
     <l n="9643">Of lustful appetence , to sing , to dance ,</l>
     <l n="9644">To dress , and troll the tongue , and roll the eye :</l>
     <l n="9645">To these that sober race of men , whose lives</l>
     <l n="9646">Religious titled them the sons of God ,</l>
     <l n="9647">Shall yield up all their virtue , all their fame</l>
     <l n="9648">Ignobly , to the trains and to the smiles</l>
     <l n="9649">Of these fair atheists ; and now swim in joy ,</l>
     <l n="9650">Erelong to swim at large ; and laugh , for which</l>
     <l n="9651">The world erelong a world of tears must weep .</l>
     <l n="9652">To whom thus Adam , of short joy bereft .</l>
     <l n="9653">O pity and shame , that they , who to live well</l>
     <l n="9654">Entered so fair , should turn aside to tread</l>
     <l n="9655">Paths indirect , or in the mid way faint !</l>
     <l n="9656">But still I see the tenour of Man 's woe</l>
     <l n="9657">Holds on the same , from Woman to begin .</l>
     <l n="9658">From Man 's effeminate slackness it begins ,</l>
     <l n="9659">Said the Angel , who should better hold his place</l>
     <l n="9660">By wisdom , and superiour gifts received .</l>
     <l n="9661">But now prepare thee for another scene .</l>
     <l n="9662">He looked , and saw wide territory spread</l>
     <l n="9663">Before him , towns , and rural works between ;</l>
     <l n="9664">Cities of men with lofty gates and towers ,</l>
     <l n="9665">Concourse in arms , fierce faces threatening war ,</l>
     <l n="9666">Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise ;</l>
     <l n="9667">Part wield their arms , part curb the foaming steed ,</l>
     <l n="9668">Single or in array of battle ranged</l>
     <l n="9669">Both horse and foot , nor idly mustering stood ;</l>
     <l n="9670">One way a band select from forage drives</l>
     <l n="9671">A herd of beeves , fair oxen and fair kine ,</l>
     <l n="9672">From a fat meadow ground ; or fleecy flock ,</l>
     <l n="9673">Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain ,</l>
     <l n="9674">Their booty ; scarce with life the shepherds fly ,</l>
     <l n="9675">But call in aid , which makes a bloody fray ;</l>
     <l n="9676">With cruel tournament the squadrons join ;</l>
     <l n="9677">Where cattle pastured late , now scattered lies</l>
     <l n="9678">With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field ,</l>
     <l n="9679">Deserted : Others to a city strong</l>
     <l n="9680">Lay siege , encamped ; by battery , scale , and mine ,</l>
     <l n="9681">Assaulting ; others from the wall defend</l>
     <l n="9682">With dart and javelin , stones , and sulphurous fire ;</l>
     <l n="9683">On each hand slaughter , and gigantick deeds .</l>
     <l n="9684">In other part the sceptered heralds call</l>
     <l n="9685">To council , in the city-gates ; anon</l>
     <l n="9686">Gray-headed men and grave , with warriours mixed ,</l>
     <l n="9687">Assemble , and harangues are heard ; but soon ,</l>
     <l n="9688">In factious opposition ; till at last ,</l>
     <l n="9689">Of middle age one rising , eminent</l>
     <l n="9690">In wise deport , spake much of right and wrong ,</l>
     <l n="9691">Of justice , or religion , truth , and peace ,</l>
     <l n="9692">And judgement from above : him old and young</l>
     <l n="9693">Exploded , and had seized with violent hands ,</l>
     <l n="9694">Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence</l>
     <l n="9695">Unseen amid the throng : so violence</l>
     <l n="9696">Proceeded , and oppression , and sword-law ,</l>
     <l n="9697">Through all the plain , and refuge none was found .</l>
     <l n="9698">Adam was all in tears , and to his guide</l>
     <l n="9699">Lamenting turned full sad ; O ! what are these ,</l>
     <l n="9700">Death 's ministers , not men ? who thus deal death</l>
     <l n="9701">Inhumanly to men , and multiply</l>
     <l n="9702">Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew</l>
     <l n="9703">His brother : for of whom such massacre</l>
     <l n="9704">Make they , but of their brethren ; men of men</l>
     <l n="9705">But who was that just man , whom had not Heaven</l>
     <l n="9706">Rescued , had in his righteousness been lost ?</l>
     <l n="9707">To whom thus Michael . These are the product</l>
     <l n="9708">Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest ;</l>
     <l n="9709">Where good with bad were matched , who of themselves</l>
     <l n="9710">Abhor to join ; and , by imprudence mixed ,</l>
     <l n="9711">Produce prodigious births of body or mind .</l>
     <l n="9712">Such were these giants , men of high renown ;</l>
     <l n="9713">For in those days might only shall be admired ,</l>
     <l n="9714">And valour and heroick virtue called ;</l>
     <l n="9715">To overcome in battle , and subdue</l>
     <l n="9716">Nations , and bring home spoils with infinite</l>
     <l n="9717">Man-slaughter , shall be held the highest pitch</l>
     <l n="9718">Of human glory ; and for glory done</l>
     <l n="9719">Of triumph , to be styled great conquerours</l>
     <l n="9720">Patrons of mankind , Gods , and sons of Gods ;</l>
     <l n="9721">Destroyers rightlier called , and plagues of men .</l>
     <l n="9722">Thus fame shall be achieved , renown on earth ;</l>
     <l n="9723">And what most merits fame , in silence hid .</l>
     <l n="9724">But he , the seventh from thee , whom thou beheldst</l>
     <l n="9725">The only righteous in a world preverse ,</l>
     <l n="9726">And therefore hated , therefore so beset</l>
     <l n="9727">With foes , for daring single to be just ,</l>
     <l n="9728">And utter odious truth , that God would come</l>
     <l n="9729">To judge them with his Saints ; him the Most High</l>
     <l n="9730">Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds</l>
     <l n="9731">Did , as thou sawest , receive , to walk with God</l>
     <l n="9732">High in salvation and the climes of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="9733">Exempt from death ; to show thee what reward</l>
     <l n="9734">Awaits the good ; the rest what punishment ;</l>
     <l n="9735">Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold .</l>
     <l n="9736">He looked , and saw the face of things quite changed ;</l>
     <l n="9737">The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar ;</l>
     <l n="9738">All now was turned to jollity and game ,</l>
     <l n="9739">To luxury and riot , feast and dance ;</l>
     <l n="9740">Marrying or prostituting , as befel ,</l>
     <l n="9741">Rape or adultery , where passing fair</l>
     <l n="9742">Allured them ; thence from cups to civil broils .</l>
     <l n="9743">At length a reverend sire among them came ,</l>
     <l n="9744">And of their doings great dislike declared ,</l>
     <l n="9745">And testified against their ways ; he oft</l>
     <l n="9746">Frequented their assemblies , whereso met ,</l>
     <l n="9747">Triumphs or festivals ; and to them preached</l>
     <l n="9748">Conversion and repentance , as to souls</l>
     <l n="9749">In prison , under judgements imminent :</l>
     <l n="9750">But all in vain : which when he saw , he ceased</l>
     <l n="9751">Contending , and removed his tents far off ;</l>
     <l n="9752">Then , from the mountain hewing timber tall ,</l>
     <l n="9753">Began to build a vessel of huge bulk ;</l>
     <l n="9754">Measured by cubit , length , and breadth , and highth ;</l>
     <l n="9755">Smeared round with pitch ; and in the side a door</l>
     <l n="9756">Contrived ; and of provisions laid in large ,</l>
     <l n="9757">For man and beast : when lo , a wonder strange !</l>
     <l n="9758">Of every beast , and bird , and insect small ,</l>
     <l n="9759">Came sevens , and pairs ; and entered in as taught</l>
     <l n="9760">Their order : last the sire and his three sons ,</l>
     <l n="9761">With their four wives ; and God made fast the door .</l>
     <l n="9762">Mean while the south-wind rose , and , with black wings</l>
     <l n="9763">Wide-hovering , all the clouds together drove</l>
     <l n="9764">From under Heaven ; the hills to their supply</l>
     <l n="9765">Vapour , and exhalation dusk and moist ,</l>
     <l n="9766">Sent up amain ; and now the thickened sky</l>
     <l n="9767">Like a dark ceiling stood ; down rushed the rain</l>
     <l n="9768">Impetuous ; and continued , till the earth</l>
     <l n="9769">No more was seen : the floating vessel swum</l>
     <l n="9770">Uplifted , and secure with beaked prow</l>
     <l n="9771">Rode tilting o'er the waves ; all dwellings else</l>
     <l n="9772">Flood overwhelmed , and them with all their pomp</l>
     <l n="9773">Deep under water rolled ; sea covered sea ,</l>
     <l n="9774">Sea without shore ; and in their palaces ,</l>
     <l n="9775">Where luxury late reigned , sea-monsters whelped</l>
     <l n="9776">And stabled ; of mankind , so numerous late ,</l>
     <l n="9777">All left , in one small bottom swum imbarked .</l>
     <l n="9778">How didst thou grieve then , Adam , to behold</l>
     <l n="9779">The end of all thy offspring , end so sad ,</l>
     <l n="9780">Depopulation ! Thee another flood ,</l>
     <l n="9781">Of tears and sorrow a flood , thee also drowned ,</l>
     <l n="9782">And sunk thee as thy sons ; till , gently reared</l>
     <l n="9783">By the Angel , on thy feet thou stoodest at last ,</l>
     <l n="9784">Though comfortless ; as when a father mourns</l>
     <l n="9785">His children , all in view destroyed at once ;</l>
     <l n="9786">And scarce to the Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint .</l>
     <l n="9787">O visions ill foreseen ! Better had I</l>
     <l n="9788">Lived ignorant of future ! so had borne</l>
     <l n="9789">My part of evil only , each day 's lot</l>
     <l n="9790">Enough to bear ; those now , that were dispensed</l>
     <l n="9791">The burden of many ages , on me light</l>
     <l n="9792">At once , by my foreknowledge gaining birth</l>
     <l n="9793">Abortive , to torment me ere their being ,</l>
     <l n="9794">With thought that they must be . Let no man seek</l>
     <l n="9795">Henceforth to be foretold , what shall befall</l>
     <l n="9796">Him or his children ; evil he may be sure ,</l>
     <l n="9797">Which neither his foreknowing can prevent ;</l>
     <l n="9798">And he the future evil shall no less</l>
     <l n="9799">In apprehension than in substance feel ,</l>
     <l n="9800">Grievous to bear : but that care now is past ,</l>
     <l n="9801">Man is not whom to warn : those few escaped</l>
     <l n="9802">Famine and anguish will at last consume ,</l>
     <l n="9803">Wandering that watery desart : I had hope ,</l>
     <l n="9804">When violence was ceased , and war on earth ,</l>
     <l n="9805">All would have then gone well ; peace would have crowned</l>
     <l n="9806">With length of happy days the race of Man ;</l>
     <l n="9807">But I was far deceived ; for now I see</l>
     <l n="9808">Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste .</l>
     <l n="9809">How comes it thus ? unfold , celestial Guide ,</l>
     <l n="9810">And whether here the race of Man will end .</l>
     <l n="9811">To whom thus Michael . Those , whom last thou sawest</l>
     <l n="9812">In triumph and luxurious wealth , are they</l>
     <l n="9813">First seen in acts of prowess eminent</l>
     <l n="9814">And great exploits , but of true virtue void ;</l>
     <l n="9815">Who , having spilt much blood , and done much wast</l>
     <l n="9816">Subduing nations , and achieved thereby</l>
     <l n="9817">Fame in the world , high titles , and rich prey ;</l>
     <l n="9818">Shall change their course to pleasure , ease , and sloth ,</l>
     <l n="9819">Surfeit , and lust ; till wantonness and pride</l>
     <l n="9820">Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace .</l>
     <l n="9821">The conquered also , and enslaved by war ,</l>
     <l n="9822">Shall , with their freedom lost , all virtue lose</l>
     <l n="9823">And fear of God ; from whom their piety feigned</l>
     <l n="9824">In sharp contest of battle found no aid</l>
     <l n="9825">Against invaders ; therefore , cooled in zeal ,</l>
     <l n="9826">Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure ,</l>
     <l n="9827">Worldly or dissolute , on what their lords</l>
     <l n="9828">Shall leave them to enjoy ; for the earth shall bear</l>
     <l n="9829">More than enough , that temperance may be tried :</l>
     <l n="9830">So all shall turn degenerate , all depraved ;</l>
     <l n="9831">Justice and temperance , truth and faith , forgot ;</l>
     <l n="9832">One man except , the only son of light</l>
     <l n="9833">In a dark age , against example good ,</l>
     <l n="9834">Against allurement , custom , and a world</l>
     <l n="9835">Offended : fearless of reproach and scorn ,</l>
     <l n="9836">Or violence , he of their wicked ways</l>
     <l n="9837">Shall them admonish ; and before them set</l>
     <l n="9838">The paths of righteousness , how much more safe</l>
     <l n="9839">And full of peace ; denouncing wrath to come</l>
     <l n="9840">On their impenitence ; and shall return</l>
     <l n="9841">Of them derided , but of God observed</l>
     <l n="9842">The one just man alive ; by his command</l>
     <l n="9843">Shall build a wonderous ark , as thou beheldst ,</l>
     <l n="9844">To save himself , and houshold , from amidst</l>
     <l n="9845">A world devote to universal wrack .</l>
     <l n="9846">No sooner he , with them of man and beast</l>
     <l n="9847">Select for life , shall in the ark be lodged ,</l>
     <l n="9848">And sheltered round ; but all the cataracts</l>
     <l n="9849">Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour</l>
     <l n="9850">Rain , day and night ; all fountains of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="9851">Broke up , shall heave the ocean to usurp</l>
     <l n="9852">Beyond all bounds ; till inundation rise</l>
     <l n="9853">Above the highest hills : Then shall this mount</l>
     <l n="9854">Of Paradise by might of waves be moved</l>
     <l n="9855">Out of his place , pushed by the horned flood ,</l>
     <l n="9856">With all his verdure spoiled , and trees adrift ,</l>
     <l n="9857">Down the great river to the opening gulf ,</l>
     <l n="9858">And there take root an island salt and bare ,</l>
     <l n="9859">The haunt of seals , and orcs , and sea-mews ’ clang :</l>
     <l n="9860">To teach thee that God attributes to place</l>
     <l n="9861">No sanctity , if none be thither brought</l>
     <l n="9862">By men who there frequent , or therein dwell .</l>
     <l n="9863">And now , what further shall ensue , behold .</l>
     <l n="9864">He looked , and saw the ark hull on the flood ,</l>
     <l n="9865">Which now abated ; for the clouds were fled ,</l>
     <l n="9866">Driven by a keen north-wind , that , blowing dry ,</l>
     <l n="9867">Wrinkled the face of deluge , as decayed ;</l>
     <l n="9868">And the clear sun on his wide watery glass</l>
     <l n="9869">Gazed hot , and of the fresh wave largely drew ,</l>
     <l n="9870">As after thirst ; which made their flowing shrink</l>
     <l n="9871">From standing lake to tripping ebb , that stole</l>
     <l n="9872">With soft foot towards the deep ; who now had stopt</l>
     <l n="9873">His sluces , as the Heaven his windows shut .</l>
     <l n="9874">The ark no more now floats , but seems on ground ,</l>
     <l n="9875">Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed .</l>
     <l n="9876">And now the tops of hills , as rocks , appear ;</l>
     <l n="9877">With clamour thence the rapid currents drive ,</l>
     <l n="9878">Towards the retreating sea , their furious tide .</l>
     <l n="9879">Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies ,</l>
     <l n="9880">And after him , the surer messenger ,</l>
     <l n="9881">A dove sent forth once and again to spy</l>
     <l n="9882">Green tree or ground , whereon his foot may light :</l>
     <l n="9883">The second time returning , in his bill</l>
     <l n="9884">An olive-leaf he brings , pacifick sign :</l>
     <l n="9885">Anon dry ground appears , and from his ark</l>
     <l n="9886">The ancient sire descends , with all his train ;</l>
     <l n="9887">Then with uplifted hands , and eyes devout ,</l>
     <l n="9888">Grateful to Heaven , over his head beholds</l>
     <l n="9889">A dewy cloud , and in the cloud a bow</l>
     <l n="9890">Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay ,</l>
     <l n="9891">Betokening peace from God , and covenant new .</l>
     <l n="9892">Whereat the heart of Adam , erst so sad ,</l>
     <l n="9893">Greatly rejoiced ; and thus his joy broke forth .</l>
     <l n="9894">O thou , who future things canst represent</l>
     <l n="9895">As present , heavenly Instructer ! I revive</l>
     <l n="9896">At this last sight ; assured that Man shall live ,</l>
     <l n="9897">With all the creatures , and their seed preserve .</l>
     <l n="9898">Far less I now lament for one whole world</l>
     <l n="9899">Of wicked sons destroyed , than I rejoice</l>
     <l n="9900">For one man found so perfect , and so just ,</l>
     <l n="9901">That God vouchsafes to raise another world</l>
     <l n="9902">From him , and all his anger to forget .</l>
     <l n="9903">But say , what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven</l>
     <l n="9904">Distended , as the brow of God appeased ?</l>
     <l n="9905">Or serve they , as a flowery verge , to bind</l>
     <l n="9906">The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud ,</l>
     <l n="9907">Lest it again dissolve , and shower the earth ?</l>
     <l n="9908">To whom the Arch-Angel . Dextrously thou aimest ;</l>
     <l n="9909">So willingly doth God remit his ire ,</l>
     <l n="9910">Though late repenting him of Man depraved ;</l>
     <l n="9911">Grieved at his heart , when looking down he saw</l>
     <l n="9912">The whole earth filled with violence , and all flesh</l>
     <l n="9913">Corrupting each their way ; yet , those removed ,</l>
     <l n="9914">Such grace shall one just man find in his sight ,</l>
     <l n="9915">That he relents , not to blot out mankind ;</l>
     <l n="9916">And makes a covenant never to destroy</l>
     <l n="9917">The earth again by flood ; nor let the sea</l>
     <l n="9918">Surpass his bounds ; nor rain to drown the world ,</l>
     <l n="9919">With man therein or beast ; but , when he brings</l>
     <l n="9920">Over the earth a cloud , will therein set</l>
     <l n="9921">His triple-coloured bow , whereon to look ,</l>
     <l n="9922">And call to mind his covenant : Day and night ,</l>
     <l n="9923">Seed-time and harvest , heat and hoary frost ,</l>
     <l n="9924">Shall hold their course ; till fire purge all things new ,</l>
     <l n="9925">Both Heaven and Earth , wherein the just shall dwell .</l>

     <l n="9935">Thy mortal sight to fail ; objects divine</l>
     <l n="9936">Must needs impair and weary human sense :</l>
     <l n="9937">Henceforth what is to come I will relate ;</l>

     <l n="9939">This second source of Men , while yet but few ,</l>
     <l n="9940">And while the dread of judgement past remains</l>
     <l n="9941">Fresh in their minds , fearing the Deity ,</l>
     <l n="9942">With some regard to what is just and right</l>
     <l n="9943">Shall lead their lives , and multiply apace ;</l>
     <l n="9944">Labouring the soil , and reaping plenteous crop ,</l>

     <l n="9947">With large wine-offerings poured , and sacred feast ,</l>
     <l n="9948">Shall spend their days in joy unblamed ; and dwell</l>
     <l n="9949">Long time in peace , by families and tribes ,</l>
     <l n="9950">Under paternal rule : till one shall rise</l>
     <l n="9951">Of proud ambitious heart ; who , not content</l>
     <l n="9952">With fair equality , fraternal state ,</l>
     <l n="9953">Will arrogate dominion undeserved</l>
     <l n="9954">Over his brethren , and quite dispossess</l>
     <l n="9955">Concord and law of nature from the earth ;</l>
     <l n="9956">Hunting ( and men not beasts shall be his game )</l>
     <l n="9957">With war , and hostile snare , such as refuse</l>
     <l n="9958">Subjection to his empire tyrannous :</l>
     <l n="9959">A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled</l>

     <l n="9961">Or from Heaven , claiming second sovranty ;</l>
     <l n="9962">And from rebellion shall derive his name ,</l>
     <l n="9963">Though of rebellion others he accuse .</l>
     <l n="9964">He with a crew , whom like ambition joins</l>
     <l n="9965">With him or under him to tyrannize ,</l>

     <l n="9969">Of brick , and of that stuff , they cast to build</l>
     <l n="9970">A city and tower , whose top may reach to Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="9971">And get themselves a name ; lest , far dispersed</l>

     <l n="9974">But God , who oft descends to visit men</l>
     <l n="9975">Unseen , and through their habitations walks</l>
     <l n="9976">To mark their doings , them beholding soon ,</l>
     <l n="9977">Comes down to see their city , ere the tower</l>
     <l n="9978">Obstruct Heaven-towers , and in derision sets</l>
     <l n="9979">Upon their tongues a various spirit , to rase</l>
     <l n="9980">Quite out their native language ; and , instead ,</l>
     <l n="9981">To sow a jangling noise of words unknown :</l>
     <l n="9982">Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud ,</l>
     <l n="9983">Among the builders ; each to other calls</l>
     <l n="9984">Not understood ; till hoarse , and all in rage ,</l>
     <l n="9985">As mocked they storm : great laughter was in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="9986">And looking down , to see the hubbub strange ,</l>
     <l n="9987">And hear the din : Thus was the building left</l>
     <l n="9988">Ridiculous , and the work Confusion named .</l>
     <l n="9989">Whereto thus Adam , fatherly displeased .</l>
     <l n="9990">O execrable son ! so to aspire</l>
     <l n="9991">Above his brethren ; to himself assuming</l>
     <l n="9992">Authority usurped , from God not given :</l>
     <l n="9993">He gave us only over beast , fish , fowl ,</l>
     <l n="9994">Dominion absolute ; that right we hold</l>
     <l n="9995">By his donation ; but man over men</l>
     <l n="9996">He made not lord ; such title to himself</l>
     <l n="9997">Reserving , human left from human free .</l>
     <l n="9998">But this usurper his encroachment proud</l>
     <l n="9999">Stays not on Man ; to God his tower intends</l>
     <l n="10000">Siege and defiance : Wretched man ! what food</l>
     <l n="10001">Will he convey up thither , to sustain</l>
     <l n="10002">Himself and his rash army ; where thin air</l>
     <l n="10003">Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross ,</l>
     <l n="10004">And famish him of breath , if not of bread ?</l>
     <l n="10005">To whom thus Michael . Justly thou abhorrest</l>
     <l n="10006">That son , who on the quiet state of men</l>
     <l n="10007">Such trouble brought , affecting to subdue</l>
     <l n="10008">Rational liberty ; yet know withal ,</l>
     <l n="10009">Since thy original lapse , true liberty</l>
     <l n="10010">Is lost , which always with right reason dwells</l>
     <l n="10011">Twinned , and from her hath no dividual being :</l>
     <l n="10012">Reason in man obscured , or not obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="10013">Immediately inordinate desires ,</l>
     <l n="10014">And upstart passions , catch the government</l>
     <l n="10015">From reason ; and to servitude reduce</l>
     <l n="10016">Man , till then free . Therefore , since he permits</l>
     <l n="10017">Within himself unworthy powers to reign</l>
     <l n="10018">Over free reason , God , in judgement just ,</l>
     <l n="10019">Subjects him from without to violent lords ;</l>
     <l n="10020">Who oft as undeservedly enthrall</l>
     <l n="10021">His outward freedom : Tyranny must be ;</l>
     <l n="10022">Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse .</l>
     <l n="10023">Yet sometimes nations will decline so low</l>
     <l n="10024">From virtue , which is reason , that no wrong ,</l>
     <l n="10025">But justice , and some fatal curse annexed ,</l>
     <l n="10026">Deprives them of their outward liberty ;</l>
     <l n="10027">Their inward lost : Witness the irreverent son</l>
     <l n="10028">Of him who built the ark ; who , for the shame</l>
     <l n="10029">Done to his father , heard this heavy curse ,</l>
     <l n="10030">Servant of servants , on his vicious race .</l>
     <l n="10031">Thus will this latter , as the former world ,</l>
     <l n="10032">Still tend from bad to worse ; till God at last ,</l>
     <l n="10033">Wearied with their iniquities , withdraw</l>
     <l n="10034">His presence from among them , and avert</l>
     <l n="10035">His holy eyes ; resolving from thenceforth</l>
     <l n="10036">To leave them to their own polluted ways ;</l>
     <l n="10037">And one peculiar nation to select</l>
     <l n="10038">From all the rest , of whom to be invoked ,</l>
     <l n="10039">A nation from one faithful man to spring :</l>
     <l n="10040">Him on this side Euphrates yet residing ,</l>
     <l n="10041">Bred up in idol-worship : O , that men</l>
     <l n="10042">( Canst thou believe ? ) should be so stupid grown ,</l>
     <l n="10043">While yet the patriarch lived , who ‘ scaped the flood ,</l>
     <l n="10044">As to forsake the living God , and fall</l>
     <l n="10045">To worship their own work in wood and stone</l>
     <l n="10046">For Gods ! Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes</l>
     <l n="10047">To call by vision , from his father 's house ,</l>
     <l n="10048">His kindred , and false Gods , into a land</l>
     <l n="10049">Which he will show him ; and from him will raise</l>
     <l n="10050">A mighty nation ; and upon him shower</l>
     <l n="10051">His benediction so , that in his seed</l>
     <l n="10052">All nations shall be blest : he straight obeys ;</l>

     <l n="10056">Ur of Chaldaea , passing now the ford</l>
     <l n="10057">To Haran ; after him a cumbrous train</l>
     <l n="10058">Of herds and flocks , and numerous servitude ;</l>
     <l n="10059">Not wandering poor , but trusting all his wealth</l>
     <l n="10060">With God , who called him , in a land unknown .</l>
     <l n="10061">Canaan he now attains ; I see his tents</l>
     <l n="10062">Pitched about Sechem , and the neighbouring plain</l>
     <l n="10063">Of Moreh ; there by promise he receives</l>
     <l n="10064">Gift to his progeny of all that land ,</l>
     <l n="10065">From Hameth northward to the Desart south ;</l>
     <l n="10066">( Things by their names I call , though yet unnamed ;)</l>
     <l n="10067">From Hermon east to the great western Sea ;</l>

     <l n="10069">In prospect , as I point them ; on the shore</l>
     <l n="10070">Mount Carmel ; here , the double-founted stream ,</l>
     <l n="10071">Jordan , true limit eastward ; but his sons</l>

     <l n="10073">This ponder , that all nations of the earth</l>
     <l n="10074">Shall in his seed be blessed : By that seed</l>
     <l n="10075">Is meant thy great Deliverer , who shall bruise</l>
     <l n="10076">The Serpent 's head ; whereof to thee anon</l>

     <l n="10078">Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call ,</l>
     <l n="10079">A son , and of his son a grand-child , leaves ;</l>
     <l n="10080">Like him in faith , in wisdom , and renown :</l>
     <l n="10081">The grandchild , with twelve sons increased , departs</l>
     <l n="10082">From Canaan to a land hereafter called</l>
     <l n="10083">Egypt , divided by the river Nile</l>
     <l n="10084">See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths</l>
     <l n="10085">Into the sea . To sojourn in that land</l>
     <l n="10086">He comes , invited by a younger son</l>
     <l n="10087">In time of dearth , a son whose worthy deeds</l>
     <l n="10088">Raise him to be the second in that realm</l>
     <l n="10089">Of Pharaoh . There he dies , and leaves his race</l>

     <l n="10092">To stop their overgrowth , as inmate guests</l>
     <l n="10093">Too numerous ; whence of guests he makes them slaves</l>
     <l n="10094">Inhospitably , and kills their infant males :</l>
     <l n="10095">Till by two brethren ( these two brethren call</l>
     <l n="10096">Moses and Aaron ) sent from God to claim</l>
     <l n="10097">His people from enthralment , they return ,</l>
     <l n="10098">With glory and spoil , back to their promised land .</l>
     <l n="10099">But first , the lawless tyrant , who denies</l>
     <l n="10100">To know their God , or message to regard ,</l>
     <l n="10101">Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire ;</l>
     <l n="10102">To blood unshed the rivers must be turned ;</l>
     <l n="10103">Frogs , lice , and flies , must all his palace fill</l>
     <l n="10104">With loathed intrusion , and fill all the land ;</l>
     <l n="10105">His cattle must of rot and murren die ;</l>
     <l n="10106">Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss ,</l>
     <l n="10107">And all his people ; thunder mixed with hail ,</l>
     <l n="10108">Hail mixed with fire , must rend the Egyptians sky ,</l>
     <l n="10109">And wheel on the earth , devouring where it rolls ;</l>
     <l n="10110">What it devours not , herb , or fruit , or grain ,</l>
     <l n="10111">A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down</l>
     <l n="10112">Must eat , and on the ground leave nothing green ;</l>
     <l n="10113">Darkness must overshadow all his bounds ,</l>
     <l n="10114">Palpable darkness , and blot out three days ;</l>
     <l n="10115">Last , with one midnight stroke , all the first-born</l>
     <l n="10116">Of Egypt must lie dead . Thus with ten wounds</l>
     <l n="10117">The river-dragon tamed at length submits</l>
     <l n="10118">To let his sojourners depart , and oft</l>
     <l n="10119">Humbles his stubborn heart ; but still , as ice</l>
     <l n="10120">More hardened after thaw ; till , in his rage</l>
     <l n="10121">Pursuing whom he late dismissed , the sea</l>
     <l n="10122">Swallows him with his host ; but them lets pass ,</l>
     <l n="10123">As on dry land , between two crystal walls ;</l>
     <l n="10124">Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand</l>
     <l n="10125">Divided , till his rescued gain their shore :</l>
     <l n="10126">Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend ,</l>
     <l n="10127">Though present in his Angel ; who shall go</l>
     <l n="10128">Before them in a cloud , and pillar of fire ;</l>
     <l n="10129">By day a cloud , by night a pillar of fire ;</l>
     <l n="10130">To guide them in their journey , and remove</l>
     <l n="10131">Behind them , while the obdurate king pursues :</l>
     <l n="10132">All night he will pursue ; but his approach</l>
     <l n="10133">Darkness defends between till morning watch ;</l>
     <l n="10134">Then through the fiery pillar , and the cloud ,</l>
     <l n="10135">God looking forth will trouble all his host ,</l>
     <l n="10136">And craze their chariot-wheels : when by command</l>
     <l n="10137">Moses once more his potent rod extends</l>
     <l n="10138">Over the sea ; the sea his rod obeys ;</l>
     <l n="10139">On their embattled ranks the waves return ,</l>
     <l n="10140">And overwhelm their war : The race elect</l>
     <l n="10141">Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance</l>
     <l n="10142">Through the wild Desart , not the readiest way ;</l>
     <l n="10143">Lest , entering on the Canaanite alarmed ,</l>
     <l n="10144">War terrify them inexpert , and fear</l>
     <l n="10145">Return them back to Egypt , choosing rather</l>
     <l n="10146">Inglorious life with servitude ; for life</l>
     <l n="10147">To noble and ignoble is more sweet</l>
     <l n="10148">Untrained in arms , where rashness leads not on .</l>
     <l n="10149">This also shall they gain by their delay</l>
     <l n="10150">In the wide wilderness ; there they shall found</l>
     <l n="10151">Their government , and their great senate choose</l>
     <l n="10152">Through the twelve tribes , to rule by laws ordained :</l>
     <l n="10153">God from the mount of Sinai , whose gray top</l>
     <l n="10154">Shall tremble , he descending , will himself</l>
     <l n="10155">In thunder , lightning , and loud trumpets ’ sound ,</l>
     <l n="10156">Ordain them laws ; part , such as appertain</l>
     <l n="10157">To civil justice ; part , religious rites</l>
     <l n="10158">Of sacrifice ; informing them , by types</l>

     <l n="10160">The Serpent , by what means he shall achieve</l>
     <l n="10161">Mankind 's deliverance . But the voice of God</l>
     <l n="10162">To mortal ear is dreadful : They beseech</l>
     <l n="10163">That Moses might report to them his will ,</l>
     <l n="10164">And terrour cease ; he grants what they besought ,</l>
     <l n="10165">Instructed that to God is no access</l>
     <l n="10166">Without Mediator , whose high office now</l>
     <l n="10167">Moses in figure bears ; to introduce</l>
     <l n="10168">One greater , of whose day he shall foretel ,</l>
     <l n="10169">And all the Prophets in their age the times</l>
     <l n="10170">Of great Messiah shall sing . Thus , laws and rites</l>
     <l n="10171">Established , such delight hath God in Men</l>
     <l n="10172">Obedient to his will , that he vouchsafes</l>
     <l n="10173">Among them to set up his tabernacle ;</l>
     <l n="10174">The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell :</l>
     <l n="10175">By his prescript a sanctuary is framed</l>
     <l n="10176">Of cedar , overlaid with gold ; therein</l>
     <l n="10177">An ark , and in the ark his testimony ,</l>
     <l n="10178">The records of his covenant ; over these</l>
     <l n="10179">A mercy-seat of gold , between the wings</l>

     <l n="10185">Conducted by his Angel , to the land</l>
     <l n="10186">Promised to Abraham and his seed :— The rest</l>
     <l n="10187">Were long to tell ; how many battles fought</l>
     <l n="10188">How many kings destroyed ; and kingdoms won ;</l>
     <l n="10189">Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still</l>

     <l n="10205">Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means .</l>
     <l n="10206">This yet I apprehend not , why to those</l>
     <l n="10207">Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth</l>
     <l n="10208">So many and so various laws are given ;</l>

     <l n="10212">Will reign among them , as of thee begot ;</l>
     <l n="10213">And therefore was law given them , to evince</l>
     <l n="10214">Their natural pravity , by stirring up</l>
     <l n="10215">Sin against law to fight : that when they see</l>
     <l n="10216">Law can discover sin , but not remove ,</l>
     <l n="10217">Save by those shadowy expiations weak ,</l>
     <l n="10218">The blood of bulls and goats , they may conclude</l>
     <l n="10219">Some blood more precious must be paid for Man ;</l>

     <l n="10222">Justification towards God , and peace</l>
     <l n="10223">Of conscience ; which the law by ceremonies</l>
     <l n="10224">Cannot appease ; nor Man the mortal part</l>
     <l n="10225">Perform ; and , not performing , cannot live .</l>
     <l n="10226">So law appears imperfect ; and but given</l>
     <l n="10227">With purpose to resign them , in full time ,</l>
     <l n="10228">Up to a better covenant ; disciplined</l>
     <l n="10229">From shadowy types to truth ; from flesh to spirit ;</l>

     <l n="10261">Such follow him , as shall be registered</l>
     <l n="10262">Part good , part bad ; of bad the longer scroll ;</l>
     <l n="10263">Whose foul idolatries , and other faults</l>
     <l n="10264">Heaped to the popular sum , will so incense</l>
     <l n="10265">God , as to leave them , and expose their land ,</l>
     <l n="10266">Their city , his temple , and his holy ark ,</l>

     <l n="10269">Left in confusion ; Babylon thence called .</l>
     <l n="10270">There in captivity he lets them dwell</l>

     <l n="10272">Remembering mercy , and his covenant sworn</l>
     <l n="10273">To David , stablished as the days of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="10274">Returned from Babylon by leave of kings</l>
     <l n="10275">Their lords , whom God disposed , the house of God</l>
     <l n="10276">They first re-edify ; and for a while</l>
     <l n="10277">In mean estate live moderate ; till , grown</l>
     <l n="10278">In wealth and multitude , factious they grow ;</l>
     <l n="10279">But first among the priests dissention springs ,</l>
     <l n="10280">Men who attend the altar , and should most</l>
     <l n="10281">Endeavour peace : their strife pollution brings</l>
     <l n="10282">Upon the temple itself : at last they seise</l>
     <l n="10283">The scepter , and regard not David 's sons ;</l>
     <l n="10284">Then lose it to a stranger , that the true</l>

     <l n="10286">Barred of his right ; yet at his birth a star ,</l>
     <l n="10287">Unseen before in Heaven , proclaims him come ;</l>
     <l n="10288">And guides the eastern sages , who inquire</l>
     <l n="10289">His place , to offer incense , myrrh , and gold :</l>
     <l n="10290">His place of birth a solemn Angel tells</l>
     <l n="10291">To simple shepherds , keeping watch by night ;</l>
     <l n="10292">They gladly thither haste , and by a quire</l>
     <l n="10293">Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung .</l>
     <l n="10294">A virgin is his mother , but his sire</l>
     <l n="10295">The power of the Most High : He shall ascend</l>
     <l n="10296">The throne hereditary , and bound his reign</l>
     <l n="10297">With Earth 's wide bounds , his glory with the Heavens .</l>
     <l n="10298">He ceased , discerning Adam with such joy</l>
     <l n="10299">Surcharged , as had like grief been dewed in tears ,</l>
     <l n="10300">Without the vent of words ; which these he breathed .</l>
     <l n="10301">O prophet of glad tidings , finisher</l>
     <l n="10302">Of utmost hope ! now clear I understand</l>
     <l n="10303">What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain ;</l>
     <l n="10304">Why our great Expectation should be called</l>
     <l n="10305">The seed of Woman : Virgin Mother , hail ,</l>
     <l n="10306">High in the love of Heaven ; yet from my loins</l>
     <l n="10307">Thou shalt proceed , and from thy womb the Son</l>
     <l n="10308">Of God Most High : so God with Man unites !</l>
     <l n="10309">Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise</l>
     <l n="10310">Expect with mortal pain : Say where and when</l>
     <l n="10311">Their fight , what stroke shall bruise the victor 's heel .</l>
     <l n="10312">To whom thus Michael . Dream not of their fight ,</l>
     <l n="10313">As of a duel , or the local wounds</l>
     <l n="10314">Of head or heel : Not therefore joins the Son</l>
     <l n="10315">Manhood to Godhead , with more strength to foil</l>
     <l n="10316">Thy enemy ; nor so is overcome</l>
     <l n="10317">Satan , whose fall from Heaven , a deadlier bruise ,</l>
     <l n="10318">Disabled , not to give thee thy death 's wound :</l>
     <l n="10319">Which he , who comes thy Saviour , shall recure ,</l>
     <l n="10320">Not by destroying Satan , but his works</l>
     <l n="10321">In thee , and in thy seed : Nor can this be ,</l>
     <l n="10322">But by fulfilling that which thou didst want ,</l>
     <l n="10323">Obedience to the law of God , imposed</l>
     <l n="10324">On penalty of death , and suffering death ;</l>
     <l n="10325">The penalty to thy transgression due ,</l>
     <l n="10326">And due to theirs which out of thine will grow :</l>
     <l n="10327">So only can high Justice rest appaid .</l>
     <l n="10328">The law of God exact he shall fulfil</l>
     <l n="10329">Both by obedience and by love , though love</l>
     <l n="10330">Alone fulfil the law ; thy punishment</l>
     <l n="10331">He shall endure , by coming in the flesh</l>
     <l n="10332">To a reproachful life , and cursed death ;</l>
     <l n="10333">Proclaiming life to all who shall believe</l>
     <l n="10334">In his redemption ; and that his obedience ,</l>
     <l n="10335">Imputed , becomes theirs by faith ; his merits</l>
     <l n="10336">To save them , not their own , though legal , works .</l>
     <l n="10337">For this he shall live hated , be blasphemed ,</l>
     <l n="10338">Seised on by force , judged , and to death condemned</l>
     <l n="10339">A shameful and accursed , nailed to the cross</l>
     <l n="10340">By his own nation ; slain for bringing life :</l>
     <l n="10341">But to the cross he nails thy enemies ,</l>
     <l n="10342">The law that is against thee , and the sins</l>
     <l n="10343">Of all mankind , with him there crucified ,</l>
     <l n="10344">Never to hurt them more who rightly trust</l>
     <l n="10345">In this his satisfaction ; so he dies ,</l>
     <l n="10346">But soon revives ; Death over him no power</l>
     <l n="10347">Shall long usurp ; ere the third dawning light</l>
     <l n="10348">Return , the stars of morn shall see him rise</l>
     <l n="10349">Out of his grave , fresh as the dawning light ,</l>
     <l n="10350">Thy ransom paid , which Man from death redeems ,</l>
     <l n="10351">His death for Man , as many as offered life</l>
     <l n="10352">Neglect not , and the benefit embrace</l>
     <l n="10353">By faith not void of works : This God-like act</l>
     <l n="10354">Annuls thy doom , the death thou shouldest have died ,</l>
     <l n="10355">In sin for ever lost from life ; this act</l>
     <l n="10356">Shall bruise the head of Satan , crush his strength ,</l>
     <l n="10357">Defeating Sin and Death , his two main arms ;</l>
     <l n="10358">And fix far deeper in his head their stings</l>
     <l n="10359">Than temporal death shall bruise the victor 's heel ,</l>
     <l n="10360">Or theirs whom he redeems ; a death , like sleep ,</l>
     <l n="10361">A gentle wafting to immortal life .</l>
     <l n="10362">Nor after resurrection shall he stay</l>
     <l n="10363">Longer on earth , than certain times to appear</l>
     <l n="10364">To his disciples , men who in his life</l>
     <l n="10365">Still followed him ; to them shall leave in charge</l>
     <l n="10366">To teach all nations what of him they learned</l>
     <l n="10367">And his salvation ; them who shall believe</l>
     <l n="10368">Baptizing in the profluent stream , the sign</l>
     <l n="10369">Of washing them from guilt of sin to life</l>
     <l n="10370">Pure , and in mind prepared , if so befall ,</l>
     <l n="10371">For death , like that which the Redeemer died .</l>
     <l n="10372">All nations they shall teach ; for , from that day ,</l>
     <l n="10373">Not only to the sons of Abraham 's loins</l>
     <l n="10374">Salvation shall be preached , but to the sons</l>
     <l n="10375">Of Abraham 's faith wherever through the world ;</l>
     <l n="10376">So in his seed all nations shall be blest .</l>
     <l n="10377">Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend</l>
     <l n="10378">With victory , triumphing through the air</l>
     <l n="10379">Over his foes and thine ; there shall surprise</l>
     <l n="10380">The Serpent , prince of air , and drag in chains</l>
     <l n="10381">Through all his realm , and there confounded leave ;</l>
     <l n="10382">Then enter into glory , and resume</l>
     <l n="10383">His seat at God 's right hand , exalted high</l>
     <l n="10384">Above all names in Heaven ; and thence shall come ,</l>
     <l n="10385">When this world 's dissolution shall be ripe ,</l>
     <l n="10386">With glory and power to judge both quick and dead ;</l>
     <l n="10387">To judge the unfaithful dead , but to reward</l>
     <l n="10388">His faithful , and receive them into bliss ,</l>
     <l n="10389">Whether in Heaven or Earth ; for then the Earth</l>
     <l n="10390">Shall all be Paradise , far happier place</l>
     <l n="10391">Than this of Eden , and far happier days .</l>
     <l n="10392">So spake the Arch-Angel Michael ; then paused ,</l>
     <l n="10393">As at the world 's great period ; and our sire ,</l>
     <l n="10394">Replete with joy and wonder , thus replied .</l>
     <l n="10395">O Goodness infinite , Goodness immense !</l>
     <l n="10396">That all this good of evil shall produce ,</l>
     <l n="10397">And evil turn to good ; more wonderful</l>
     <l n="10398">Than that which by creation first brought forth</l>
     <l n="10399">Light out of darkness ! Full of doubt I stand ,</l>
     <l n="10400">Whether I should repent me now of sin</l>
     <l n="10401">By me done , and occasioned ; or rejoice</l>
     <l n="10402">Much more , that much more good thereof shall spring ;</l>
     <l n="10403">To God more glory , more good-will to Men</l>
     <l n="10404">From God , and over wrath grace shall abound .</l>
     <l n="10405">But say , if our Deliverer up to Heaven</l>
     <l n="10406">Must re-ascend , what will betide the few</l>
     <l n="10407">His faithful , left among the unfaithful herd ,</l>
     <l n="10408">The enemies of truth ? Who then shall guide</l>
     <l n="10409">His people , who defend ? Will they not deal</l>
     <l n="10410">Worse with his followers than with him they dealt ?</l>
     <l n="10411">Be sure they will , said the Angel ; but from Heaven</l>
     <l n="10412">He to his own a Comforter will send ,</l>
     <l n="10413">The promise of the Father , who shall dwell</l>
     <l n="10414">His Spirit within them ; and the law of faith ,</l>
     <l n="10415">Working through love , upon their hearts shall write ,</l>
     <l n="10416">To guide them in all truth ; and also arm</l>
     <l n="10417">With spiritual armour , able to resist</l>
     <l n="10418">Satan 's assaults , and quench his fiery darts ;</l>
     <l n="10419">What man can do against them , not afraid ,</l>
     <l n="10420">Though to the death ; against such cruelties</l>
     <l n="10421">With inward consolations recompensed ,</l>
     <l n="10422">And oft supported so as shall amaze</l>
     <l n="10423">Their proudest persecutors : For the Spirit ,</l>
     <l n="10424">Poured first on his Apostles , whom he sends</l>
     <l n="10425">To evangelize the nations , then on all</l>
     <l n="10426">Baptized , shall them with wonderous gifts endue</l>
     <l n="10427">To speak all tongues , and do all miracles ,</l>
     <l n="10428">As did their Lord before them . Thus they win</l>
     <l n="10429">Great numbers of each nation to receive</l>
     <l n="10430">With joy the tidings brought from Heaven : At length</l>
     <l n="10431">Their ministry performed , and race well run ,</l>
     <l n="10432">Their doctrine and their story written left ,</l>
     <l n="10433">They die ; but in their room , as they forewarn ,</l>
     <l n="10434">Wolves shall succeed for teachers , grievous wolves ,</l>
     <l n="10435">Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven</l>
     <l n="10436">To their own vile advantages shall turn</l>
     <l n="10437">Of lucre and ambition ; and the truth</l>
     <l n="10438">With superstitions and traditions taint ,</l>
     <l n="10439">Left only in those written records pure ,</l>
     <l n="10440">Though not but by the Spirit understood .</l>
     <l n="10441">Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names ,</l>
     <l n="10442">Places , and titles , and with these to join</l>
     <l n="10443">Secular power ; though feigning still to act</l>
     <l n="10444">By spiritual , to themselves appropriating</l>
     <l n="10445">The Spirit of God , promised alike and given</l>
     <l n="10446">To all believers ; and , from that pretence ,</l>
     <l n="10447">Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force</l>
     <l n="10448">On every conscience ; laws which none shall find</l>
     <l n="10449">Left them inrolled , or what the Spirit within</l>
     <l n="10450">Shall on the heart engrave . What will they then</l>
     <l n="10451">But force the Spirit of Grace itself , and bind</l>
     <l n="10452">His consort Liberty ? what , but unbuild</l>
     <l n="10453">His living temples , built by faith to stand ,</l>
     <l n="10454">Their own faith , not another 's ? for , on earth ,</l>
     <l n="10455">Who against faith and conscience can be heard</l>
     <l n="10456">Infallible ? yet many will presume :</l>
     <l n="10457">Whence heavy persecution shall arise</l>
     <l n="10458">On all , who in the worship persevere</l>
     <l n="10459">Of spirit and truth ; the rest , far greater part ,</l>
     <l n="10460">Will deem in outward rites and specious forms</l>
     <l n="10461">Religion satisfied ; Truth shall retire</l>
     <l n="10462">Bestuck with slanderous darts , and works of faith</l>
     <l n="10463">Rarely be found : So shall the world go on ,</l>
     <l n="10464">To good malignant , to bad men benign ;</l>
     <l n="10465">Under her own weight groaning ; till the day</l>
     <l n="10466">Appear of respiration to the just ,</l>
     <l n="10467">And vengeance to the wicked , at return</l>
     <l n="10468">Of him so lately promised to thy aid ,</l>
     <l n="10469">The Woman 's Seed ; obscurely then foretold ,</l>
     <l n="10470">Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord ;</l>
     <l n="10471">Last , in the clouds , from Heaven to be revealed</l>
     <l n="10472">In glory of the Father , to dissolve</l>
     <l n="10473">Satan with his perverted world ; then raise</l>
     <l n="10474">From the conflagrant mass , purged and refined ,</l>
     <l n="10475">New Heavens , new Earth , ages of endless date ,</l>
     <l n="10476">Founded in righteousness , and peace , and love ;</l>
     <l n="10477">To bring forth fruits , joy and eternal bliss .</l>
     <l n="10478">He ended ; and thus Adam last replied .</l>
     <l n="10479">How soon hath thy prediction , Seer blest ,</l>
     <l n="10480">Measured this transient world , the race of time ,</l>
     <l n="10481">Till time stand fixed ! Beyond is all abyss ,</l>
     <l n="10482">Eternity , whose end no eye can reach .</l>
     <l n="10483">Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart ;</l>
     <l n="10484">Greatly in peace of thought ; and have my fill</l>
     <l n="10485">Of knowledge , what this vessel can contain ;</l>
     <l n="10486">Beyond which was my folly to aspire .</l>
     <l n="10487">Henceforth I learn , that to obey is best ,</l>
     <l n="10488">And love with fear the only God ; to walk</l>
     <l n="10489">As in his presence ; ever to observe</l>
     <l n="10490">His providence ; and on him sole depend ,</l>
     <l n="10491">Merciful over all his works , with good</l>
     <l n="10492">Still overcoming evil , and by small</l>
     <l n="10493">Accomplishing great things , by things deemed weak</l>
     <l n="10494">Subverting worldly strong , and worldly wise</l>
     <l n="10495">By simply meek : that suffering for truth 's sake</l>
     <l n="10496">Is fortitude to highest victory ,</l>
     <l n="10497">And , to the faithful , death the gate of life ;</l>
     <l n="10498">Taught this by his example , whom I now</l>
     <l n="10499">Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest .</l>
     <l n="10500">To whom thus also the Angel last replied .</l>
     <l n="10501">This having learned , thou hast attained the sum</l>
     <l n="10502">Of wisdom ; hope no higher , though all the stars</l>
     <l n="10503">Thou knewest by name , and all the ethereal powers ,</l>
     <l n="10504">All secrets of the deep , all Nature 's works ,</l>
     <l n="10505">Or works of God in Heaven , air , earth , or sea ,</l>
     <l n="10506">And all the riches of this world enjoyedst ,</l>
     <l n="10507">And all the rule , one empire ; only add</l>
     <l n="10508">Deeds to thy knowledge answerable ; add faith ,</l>

     <l n="10512">To leave this Paradise , but shalt possess</l>
     <l n="10513">A Paradise within thee , happier far .—</l>
     <l n="10514">Let us descend now therefore from this top</l>
     <l n="10515">Of speculation ; for the hour precise</l>
     <l n="10516">Exacts our parting hence ; and see the guards ,</l>
     <l n="10517">By me encamped on yonder hill , expect</l>
     <l n="10518">Their motion ; at whose front a flaming sword ,</l>
     <l n="10519">In signal of remove , waves fiercely round :</l>
     <l n="10520">We may no longer stay : go , waken Eve ;</l>
     <l n="10521">Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed</l>
     <l n="10522">Portending good , and all her spirits composed</l>
     <l n="10523">To meek submission : thou , at season fit ,</l>
     <l n="10524">Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard ;</l>
     <l n="10525">Chiefly what may concern her faith to know ,</l>
     <l n="10526">The great deliverance by her seed to come</l>
     <l n="10527">( For by the Woman 's seed ) on all mankind :</l>
     <l n="10528">That ye may live , which will be many days ,</l>
     <l n="10529">Both in one faith unanimous , though sad ,</l>
     <l n="10530">With cause , for evils past ; yet much more cheered</l>
     <l n="10531">With meditation on the happy end .</l>
     <l n="10532">He ended , and they both descend the hill ;</l>
     <l n="10533">Descended , Adam to the bower , where Eve</l>
     <l n="10534">Lay sleeping , ran before ; but found her waked ;</l>
     <l n="10535">And thus with words not sad she him received .</l>
     <l n="10536">Whence thou returnest , and whither wentest , I know ;</l>
     <l n="10537">For God is also in sleep ; and dreams advise ,</l>
     <l n="10538">Which he hath sent propitious , some great good</l>
     <l n="10539">Presaging , since with sorrow and heart 's distress</l>
     <l n="10540">Wearied I fell asleep : But now lead on ;</l>
     <l n="10541">In me is no delay ; with thee to go ,</l>
     <l n="10542">Is to stay here ; without thee here to stay ,</l>
     <l n="10543">Is to go hence unwilling ; thou to me</l>
     <l n="10544">Art all things under Heaven , all places thou ,</l>
     <l n="10545">Who for my wilful crime art banished hence .</l>
     <l n="10546">This further consolation yet secure</l>
     <l n="10547">I carry hence ; though all by me is lost ,</l>
     <l n="10548">Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed ,</l>
     <l n="10549">By me the Promised Seed shall all restore .</l>
     <l n="10550">So spake our mother Eve ; and Adam heard</l>
     <l n="10551">Well pleased , but answered not : For now , too nigh</l>
     <l n="10552">The Arch-Angel stood ; and , from the other hill</l>
     <l n="10553">To their fixed station , all in bright array</l>
     <l n="10554">The Cherubim descended ; on the ground</l>
     <l n="10555">Gliding meteorous , as evening-mist</l>
     <l n="10556">Risen from a river o'er the marish glides ,</l>
     <l n="10557">And gathers ground fast at the labourer 's heel</l>
     <l n="10558">Homeward returning . High in front advanced ,</l>
     <l n="10559">The brandished sword of God before them blazed ,</l>
     <l n="10560">Fierce as a comet ; which with torrid heat ,</l>
     <l n="10561">And vapour as the Libyan air adust ,</l>
     <l n="10562">Began to parch that temperate clime ; whereat</l>
     <l n="10563">In either hand the hastening Angel caught</l>
     <l n="10564">Our lingering parents , and to the eastern gate</l>
     <l n="10565">Led them direct , and down the cliff as fast</l>
     <l n="10566">To the subjected plain ; then disappeared .</l>
     <l n="10567">They , looking back , all the eastern side beheld</l>
     <l n="10568">Of Paradise , so late their happy seat ,</l>
     <l n="10569">Waved over by that flaming brand ; the gate</l>
     <l n="10570">With dreadful faces thronged , and fiery arms :</l>
     <l n="10571">Some natural tears they dropt , but wiped them soon ;</l>
     <l n="10572">The world was all before them , where to choose</l>
     <l n="10573">Their place of rest , and Providence their guide :</l>
     <l n="10574">They , hand in hand , with wandering steps and slow ,</l>
     <l n="10575">Through Eden took their solitary way .</l>
