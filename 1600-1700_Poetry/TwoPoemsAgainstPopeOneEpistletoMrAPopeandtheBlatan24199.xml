    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="2">I .</p>
    <p n="3">One Epistle To Mr. Pope , complained Pope to Bethel , “ contains as many Lyes as Lines .” But just for that reason it is not , as Pope also says in the same letter , “ below all notice .”[ 1 ] The Blatant Beast , published twelve years later , is another attack on Pope almost as compendious and quite as virulent . They are here presented to the modern student of Pope as good examples of their kind . The importance of the pamphlet attacks on Pope for a full understanding of his satiric art is universally admitted , but the pamphlets themselves were cheap and ephemeral , and copies are now rare and not easily come by . Both in the comprehensiveness of their charges and in the slashing hatred which informs them ( however feeble the verse ) , One Epistle and The Blatant Beast offer as fair a sample as any two such pamphlets can of the calumny , detraction , and critical misunderstanding Pope endured , for the most part patiently , from the publication of his Essay on Criticism to the year of his death . “ Welcome for thee , fair Virtue ! all the past ,” ( Epistle to Arbuthnot , l. 358 ) he exclaimed in his role as Satirist .</p>
    <p n="4">It was this public proclamation of Virtue that confused and enraged the Dunces . We have again learned to read satire as something quite other than an expression of personal malice and misanthropy . What the present pamphlets amply testify to is that most of the Dunces were no more able to read satire properly than were Pope ’ s nineteenth-century critics . They were , as Pope quite properly kept pointing out , very bad writers and very dull men . The ethos of the satiric persona was something they could not understand . Although some of the Dunces knew their classics well and although all of them , we may presume , read the Roman satirists , one did not , typically , in Grub Street consult one ’ s Horace with diurnal hand ; one consulted the public . Literature to them was sold . They were not deeply concerned about absolute standards of right and wrong , about works of imagination which justify an entire civilization , about the problem of tradition and the individual talent . Accordingly , they explained satire , with the only vocabulary they had , as the expression of ingratitude , purely personal malice , and demonic pride , the product of a diseased heart and a misshapen body .</p>
    <p n="5">It would be misleading to suggest a narrow definition of Pope ’ s Dunces . Some were critics of worth , such as Dennis and Gildon ; some were not despicable minor poets , such as Welsted and Cooke . But if we leave these aside , as well as his aristocratic enemies , Lady Mary and Lord Hervey , some valid generalizations emerge . The very persistency of the Dunces ’ attacks on Pope ( I have located over one hundred and fifty published during Pope ’ s lifetime ) and the large number of anonymous pamphlets that we cannot definitely ascribe to anyone Pope ever mentioned suggest that the Battle of the Dunces is best seen economically and sociologically . They were , for the most part , hack-writers , who were attempting the commercialization of literature that Pope recognized and deplored . Since they were authors to be let , they were neither fastidious about standards of taste nor filled with reverence for the Word . Yet Pope had succeeded in doing what they could not do — he had made himself a moderately rich man entirely by writing poetry . No theme recurs more insistently and suggestively in Popiana than Pope ’ s wealth . Faced with the nasty fact that if one wrote well enough , there was a public to support one , they could only accuse Pope monotonously of venality and avarice .</p>
    <p n="6">In all of this there is a strong element of class antagonism . The Dunces were middle-class and Whiggish , their spirit capitalist . Pope , though middle-class by birth , was aristocratic in his sympathies , Tory in a loose sense , and firmly anti-Walpole . Perhaps verse satire is essentially aristocratic . Perhaps wit is , too . Certainly they never seem at home in a middle-class society . Wit comes to savor of indecency and blasphemy ; satire in its incessant defence of moral value and centers of order comes to seem the expression of an arrogant disdain and a disquieting unease . His poise and verbal brilliance and hieratic commitment to the venerable tradition of classical and Christian ethical thought set the Satirist coolly apart from the profanum vulgus . Had Pope never mentioned one of the Dunces , although they would have done so less frequently , they would still have cried out against him .</p>

   <head>II .</head>
   <p>One Epistle To Mr. A. Pope , Occasion ’ d By Two Epistles Lately Published appeared , according to the Daily Journal , on 28 April 1730 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Pope ’ s mention of it in Appendix II to The Dunciad A , his “ List of Books , Papers , and Verses , in which our Author was abused ” which is our best guide to Popiana , is somewhat confusing and made more difficult because the first part dates from 1729 , the second from 1735 : “ Labeo , A Paper of Verses written by Leonard Welsted . [ 1729 a-d ] , which after came into One Epistle , and was publish ’ d by James Moore . 4to . 1730 . Another part of it came out in Welsted ’ s own name in 1731 , under the just Title of Dulness and Scandal , fol . [ 1735a ] .”[ 3 ]</p>
   <p>The Labeo reference is mysterious . Pope in his note on Welsted to The Dunciad A II. 293 had said in a sentence omitted in all editions from 1735a , “ The strength of the metaphors in this passage is to express the great scurrility and fury of this writer , which may be seen , One day , in a Piece of his , call ’ d ( as I think ) Labeo .”[ 4 ] Since no Labeo has ever turned up , it seems reasonable to conclude with Fineman that , though Welsted may have toyed with the idea of writing one , “ he either never did enough with it to warrant its publication , or discarded it entirely in favor of writing the collaborative One Epistle to Mr. Pope that appeared in 1730 . Naturally , he would not broadcast his plans , and as a result the enemy camp continued to believe — or at any rate , to say — that Welsted would retaliate with a Labeo .”[ 5 ] This was in 1729 ; by 1735 Pope had realized no Labeo would appear and deciding , apparently on no evidence , that it had been incorporated into Welsted ’ s One Epistle and Of Dulness and Scandal ( 1732 ) , made the appropriate changes in The Dunciad .</p>
   <p>Pope did not at first realize that One Epistle was by Welsted . It had been announced as early as 1 Feb. 1729 in The Universal Spectator “ as the due Chastisement of Mr. Pope for his Dunciad , by James Moore Smythe , Esq ; and Mr. Welsted .” The poem must have been circulated privately before publication at least by October , 1729 at which time Pope believed it to be Lady Mary ’ s , since we find Lady Mary writing to Dr. Arbuthnot twice in October 1729 denying Pope ’ s accusation that she had written it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>There is no evidence that she was not telling the truth , but on 21 May 1730 The Grub-Street Journal reported that Lady Mary had “ some hand in the piece .”</p>
   <p>Like most Pope attacks , the poem was published anonymously . The preface , a defence of the Dunces , is , with probably intentional ambiguity , written in the first person singular but ends by referring to “ the Writers of the following Poem ” ( p. viii ) . One hand seems responsible for the preface , but we can only conclude that a Dunce collaborating with other Dunces produced the poem . Four days after its publication Pope wrote to Broome that it was “ by James Moore and others ,” and a few weeks later wrote to Bethel that “ James Moore own ’ d it but was made by three others , and he will disown it whenever any man takes him for it .”[ 7 ] It was Moore Smythe who was attacked in The Grub-Street Journal for several months as the poem ’ s chief author .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></p>
   <p>A letter from Welsted to Dodington , however , shows that though the poem was a collaborative effort and though others may have made suggestions and additions , Welsted felt himself responsible for the poem .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>In 1735 Pope attributed One Epistle finally to Welsted , with Moore Smythe as publisher , and in 1737 The Memoirs of Grub-Street said of Moore Smythe that he “ reported himself author ” of One Epistle , “ but was only a publisher ; it being written by Mr. Welsted and others .”[ 10 ]</p>
   <p>As to the “ others ” we should remember Mallet ’ s caution that it would be vain ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To guess , ere One Epistle saw the light ,</l>
     <l n="2">How many brother-dunces club ’ d their mite .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>Welsted himself had begun his quarrel with Pope with an attack on Three Hours after Marriage , that amusing and much-abused play , in Palaemon To Caelia at Bath ; Or , The Triumvirate ( 1717 ) . Pope is said to have collaborated with Gay not only in Three Hours , a play “ so lewd ,/ Ev ’ n Bullies blush ’ d , and Beaux astonish ’ d stood ” ( Second Edition , p. 11 ) , but in The Wife of Bath and The What D ’ Ye Call It . Welsted also hits at God ’ s Revenge Against Punning , the First Psalm , praises Tickell , and finds Pope ’ s versification flat . All of these charges ( except the one that Pope collaborated in The Wife of Bath ) had appeared in print before , but Pope was to remember Palaemon To Caelia and include it in a note to The Dunciad A II. 293 , where it is neatly described as “ meant for a Satire on Mr. P. and some of his friends .”</p>
   <p>In 1721 Welsted ’ s name appears in the title of a pamphlet containing an attack on Pope ’ s Homer , An Epistle To Mr. Welsted ; And A Satyre on the English Translations of Homer , by that engagingly inept Dunce , Bezaleel Morrice . In 1724 in the “ Dissertation concerning the Perfection of the English Language ” prefixed to his Epistles , Odes , &amp; c ., Welsted quoted ( not quite correctly ) and criticized Pope ’ s “ And such as Chaucer is , shall Dryden be ” ( p. x ) . The anonymous author of Characters of The Times ( 1728 ) thought that Welsted would have been spared Pope ’ s abuse if he had not in his “ Dissertation ” “ happen ’ d to cite a low and false line from Mr. P [ o ] pe for the meer Purpose of refuting it , without seeming to know , or care who was the Author of it ” ( p. 24 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span></p>
   <p>In the Peri Bathous Pope included Welsted as a didapper and an eel . Pope then put him into The Dunciad in II. 293-300 and , more memorably , in III. 163-166 :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Flow Welsted , Flow ! like thine inspirer , Beer ,</l>
     <l n="2">Tho ’ stale , not ripe ; tho ’ thin , yet never clear ;</l>
     <l n="3">So sweetly mawkish , and so smoothly dull ;</l>
     <l n="4">Heady , not strong , and foaming tho ’ not full .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Unable to leave well enough alone , Welsted continued his attack on Pope with One Epistle and then again in January 1732 with Of Dulness and Scandal , which ran to three editions . The half-title of One Epistle had promised that it was to be continued , and the writer of the preface had said that he intended “ in the preface to the next Epistle ... to state several Matters of Fact , in Contradiction to the Notes of the Dunciad ” ( p. viii ) . Of Dulness and Scandal , however , has no preface and is an independent attack . Its main charge is Pope ’ s ingratitude to the Duke of Chandos as shown in the Epistle to Burlington , a famous charge frequently to be repeated ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>but it claims as well that a lady named Victoria died as a result of reading Pope ’ s Homer and attacks once more The Rape of the Lock and the First Psalm .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In February 1732 Welsted published his last attack on Pope , Of False</l>
     <l n="2">Fame , in which he attacks Windsor Forest , The Rape of the Lock ,</l>
     <l n="3">Pope ’ s edition of Shakespeare , The Dunciad , and the Epistle to</l>
     <l n="4">Burlington . Pope then mentioned him in the Epistle to Arbuthnot , at</l>
     <l n="5">first in l. 49 , although he altered this to “ Pitholeon ,” and then in</l>
     <l n="6">l. 375 , where most twentieth-century college students first meet his</l>
     <l n="7">name .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The charges in One Epistle are unusually comprehensive , but almost none of them is original . To help the reader to evaluate the more important , the following notes may be helpful . The denial in the preface of Pope ’ s statement that no one is attacked in The Dunciad “ who had not before , either in Print or private Conversation , endeavour ’ d something to his Disadvantage ” ( p. v ) is a reference to The Dunciad , p. 203 , where , however , conversation is not mentioned . This sentence of Pope ’ s annoyed many of the Dunces .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>What the preface says about Swift and Arbuthnot and the Peri Bathous ( p. vii ) may well be true .<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Welsted ’ s charge that Pope wrote the Prologue to Cato and then “ the Play decried ” ( p. 12 ) is simply Dennis ’ s old charge first made in A True Character of Mr. Pope ( 1716 ) and repeated in Remarks Upon ... the Dunciad ( 1729 ) that Pope had teased Lintot into publishing Dennis ’ s attack on Cato . The charge rests only on Dennis ’ s authority .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>The obscenity of The Rape of the Lock was an old story .<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>So was the notorious First Psalm .<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>Welsted ’ s attacks on the Pastorals , the Homer , the Peri Bathous , and The Dunciad are simply the commonplaces of Popiana . The charge that he libeled Addison only after the great man ’ s death is also familiar<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>( Welsted seems to have been the first , though , to mention the libel on Lady Mary ) and long since disproved by Sherburn and Ault . That Pope was a plagiarist is an idea that turns up constantly .<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span></p>
   <p>Welsted ’ s other charges are more interesting . He seems to be the only Dunce who objected ( p. 12 ) to Pope ’ s mentioning Bishop Hoadly in The Dunciad A II. 368 . It may just possibly be true that Gildon was dismissed by Buckingham because of Gildon ’ s dislike of Pope ( p. 22 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span></p>
   <p>The most curious of the charges is that Pope ,</p>
   <p>... from the Skies , propitious to the Fair , Brought down Caecilia , and sent Cloris there . ( p. 11 )</p>
   <p>Welsted apparently means that Pope debased St. Cecilia in his Ode for Musick on St. Cecilia ’ s Day and glorified a suicide in his Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady . He is not saying , as did The Life of the late Celebrated Mrs. Elizabeth Wisebourn ( 1721 ) , that the heroine of the Elegy died of her unrequited love for Pope . Pope ’ s note to l. 375 of the Epistle to Arbuthnot accusing Welsted of having “ had the Impudence to tell in print , that Mr. P. had occasion ’ d a Lady ’ s death , and to name a person he never heard of ” refers not to Cloris but to Victoria in Welsted ’ s Of Dulness and Scandal who died from reading Pope ’ s Illiad .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span></p>
   <p>The Grub-Street Journal for 21 May 1730 invited “ any Person of Credit and Character to stand forth and attest any of the following Facts ....”</p>
   <p>That the late Duke of Buckingham paid any Pension to Charles Gildon , which he took from him since his acquaintance with Mr. P .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">That the present Archbishop of Canterbury hath past any Censure on</l>
     <l n="2">Mr. P .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">That Mr. F [ ento ] n and he ever were at distance on variance with each</l>
     <l n="4">other .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>That the Rev . Mr. Br [ oo ] me ever asserted or complain ’ d , he was not gratify ’ d with a competent Sum for his Share in the Odyssey ; nay did not own that he thought himself highly paid .</p>
   <p>That Mr. Addison or any other but Mr. P. writ , or alter ’ d , one line of the Prologue to Cato .</p>
   <p>Who will name any young Writer , allow ’ d to have Merit , that hath been personally discourag ’ d by him ; or who hath not received either actual Services , or amicable Treatment from him ?</p>

    <head>III .</head>
     <l n="1">The Blatant Beast appeared in December 1742 , according to The London</l>
     <l n="2">Magazine ; its authorship remains unknown . Pope had published The New</l>
     <l n="3">Dunciad in March 1742 , and Cibber had published his famous A Letter</l>
     <l n="4">From Mr. Cibber , To Mr. Pope in July . Five other pamphlets attacking</l>
     <l n="5">Pope appeared in August , obviously capitalizing on the Cibber attack .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Blatant Beast is pro-Cibber , of course , but it criticizes specifically only a few lines from The New Dunciad . The writer ’ s chief interest is in a general attack . The criticisms of the Shakespeare , of Three Hours and the Epistle to Burlington , and of Pope ’ s plagiarism are perfectly conventional . More interesting is the accusation ( p. 6 ) that Pope wrote ( as , of course , he did ) his Homer on the backs of personal letters . Also interesting is the reference to Pope ’ s inscription on the Shakespeare monument in Westminster Abbey ( p. 5 ) . Pope was , with several others , responsible for the Latin inscription ; it does not seem that he had anything to do with the lines from The Tempest IV . i . 152-156 , which were added several months later . These lines are given in the first note to The Dunciad B I. and , in slightly different form , in The Gentleman ’ s Magazine , XI , 276 . The last line reads , “ Leave not a wreck behind .” Pope ’ s version of the lines in both his 1725 and 1728 editions of Shakespeare ( Griffith 149 and 210 ) does not commit the errors of the inscription and prints , “ Leave not a rack behind !”[ 23 ] The bantering note about the monument which begins The Dunciad B may have been prompted by this passage in The Blatant Beast as well as by the comment of Theobald which Sutherland refers to .</p>
   <p>But it is the shrill personal abuse of Pope ’ s deformity and moral obliquity ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Morals blacken ’ d when the Writings scape ;</l>
     <l n="2">The libel ’ d Person , and the pictur ’ d Shape</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">( Epistle to Arbuthnot , ll . 353-353 )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>which is most impressive . The writer shows a talent for invective , but there is a good deal of evidence that he was well-read in other Pope attacks . The phrase , Pope ’ s “ Mountain Shoulders ,” ( p. 5 ) recalls Pope ’ s “ Mountain Back ” in The Difference Between Verbal and Practical Virtue , p. 5 , published in August 1742 . The image of the wasp ( pp . 6 , 10 ) had appeared in Hervey ’ s and Lady Mary ’ s Verses Address ’ d to the Imitator Of ... Horace ( 1733 ) , p. 7 ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>as had the metaphor of Pope as Satan ( pp . 5-6 ) with which The Blatant Beast opens .<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span></p>
   <p>Pope had already been pictured as a mad dog ( p. 7 ) in The Metamorphosis ( 1728 ) , attributed by Pope to Smedley and one of the least pleasant of the pamphlets . Pope as Aesop ’ s toad bursting with spleen ( p. 12 ) had been used in Codrus ( 1728 ) , p. 12 , attributed by Pope to Curll and Mrs. Thomas . Cibber ’ s prevention of Pope from peopling the isle with Calibans ( p. 9 ) is a reference , of course , to Cibber ’ s famous anecdote about rescuing Pope in the bawdy-house ; but in Mr . Taste , The Poetical Fop ( 1732 ) where Pope figures as the monkey-like poetaster Taste , the servant-maid who was to have married him is delighted the marriage is broken off , “ for fear our children should have resembled Baboons , Ha , ha , ha !” ( p. 73 ) . Stern anti-sentimentalists sometimes point out that we react too squeamishly to the abuse of Pope ’ s deformity . I doubt it myself . The eighteenth century was probably a coarser and more outspoken age than ours , but scurrilous attacks on the physical appearance of distinguished poets do not otherwise seem to have been a prominent feature of the Augustan literary scene .</p>
   <p>It is hoped that both these pamphlets will prove useful to those who have little first-hand knowledge of what his enemies said of Pope and will help to warn the novice of the fatal ease with which we can read “ with but a Lust to mis-apply ,/ Make Satire a Lampoon , and Fiction , Lye ” ( Epistle to Arbuthnot , ll . 301-302 ) .</p>
   <p>One Epistle was reprinted by John Nichols in his edition of The Works in Verse and Prose of Leonard Welsted ( London , 1787 ) . Nichols normalizes the text , spells out several names in full , and adds several unimportant notes . It is here reproduced from the copy in the Sterling Library , Yale University . The Blatant Beast has never been reprinted and is reproduced from the copy in the Huntington Library .</p>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The indecent Images , and the frequent and bad Imitations of the Classics in the Dunciad , have occasioned several just Observations upon so new and coarse a Manner of Writing : I shall wave this Topic at present , and only regard the most plausible Insinuation in Favour of this Author ; which is , that he never begun an Attack upon any Person , who had not before , either in Print or private Conversation , endeavour ’ d something to his Disadvantage .</p>
   <p>This Assertion is by no means true , as I shall immediately shew ; if it were true , it might indeed bear some Weight , but however with this Distinction , that the Reports of private Conversation , brought to him by such Emissaries , as belong to him , are not always to be believed , and that no Attack in Print upon a Man ’ s Poetical Character , ought to be repaid by Lampoon and Virulence upon the Moral Character of his Antagonist : Every Person has a Right to determine upon the Talents of Writers , particularly of one , who appears in Publick only to gratify the two worst Appetites , that disgrace Human Nature , I mean Malice and Avarice ; and sure no Man deserves a violent Injury to his Reputation , as a Gentleman , because perhaps at a Distance of several Years since he might have said , that Mr. Pope had nothing in him Original as a Writer , that Mr. Tickel greatly excelled him in his Translation of Homer , and many of his Contemporaries in other Branches of Writing , and that he is infinitely inferior to Mr. Phillips in Pastoral : And yet such Arguments or Apologies as these have been used by himself , or his Tea-Table Cabals , for calling Gentlemen Scoundrels , Blockheads , Gareteers , and Beggars ,: If he can transmit them to Posterity under such Imputations , he is a bad Man ; if he cannot , he is a bad Writer : I believe , that he would rather suffer under the first Character , than the last : But before I have done with him , I will make a very strict Inquiry into both .</p>
   <p>In the mean time I shall shew the Reader , in general , the Falshood of his main Pretence , that he has meddled with no one , that had not before hurt him , and in this View , tho ’ I should be ashamed of being too serious in a Controversy of this Sort , I think it proper to acquaint the Town with the original Design of the Dunciad , and the real Reasons of its Production . This Piece , which has been honour ’ d by Booksellers of Quality , contains only the Poetical Part of Dulness , extracted from a Libel , call ’ d , The Progress of it , and which included several other Branches of Science , and perhaps some of those Gentlemen , who have in the warmest Manner asserted the Cause of the Dunciad , might have seen a Publication of a Work , upon the Death of this Writer , in which no past Friendship could have screen ’ d them from Lampoon for any Pretences to excel in any Science whatever : It appears , therefore , that he was teaz ’ d into a Publication of these Cantos , which regarded the Writers of the Age , by some Attacks , that were made upon him about that Time : We must refer to a Miscellany of Poems published by Him and Swift , to which is prefix ’ d , An Essay on the Profund , to consider if those Attacks were justifiable ; Mr. Dean Swift never saw the Profund , till made publick , and Dr. Arburthnot , who originally sketch ’ d the Design of it , desired that the Initial Letters of Names of the Gentlemen abused might not be inserted , that they might be A or B , or Do or Ro , or any thing of that Nature , which would make this Satire a general one upon any dull Writers in any Age : This was refused by Pope , and he chose rather to treat a Set of Gentlemen as Vermin , Reptiles , &amp; c. at a Time when he had no Provocation to do so , when he had closed his Labours , finish ’ d his great Subscriptions , and was in a fashionable Degree of Reputation : Several Gentlemen , who are there ranked with the dullest Men , or dullest Beasts , never did appear in Print against him , or say any thing in Conversation which might affect his Character : Some Replies , which were made to the Profund , occasioned the Publication of the Dunciad , which was first of all begun with a general Malice to all Mankind , and now appears under an Excuse of Provocations , which he had received , after he himself had struck the first Blow in the above-mentioned Miscellanies .</p>
   <p>I cannot indeed say much in Praise of some Performances , which appear ’ d against him , and am sorry that Voluntiers enter ’ d into the War , whom I could wish to have been only Spectators : But the Cause became so general , that some Gentlemen , who never aim ’ d at the Laurel , grew Poets merely upon their being angry : A Militia , in Case of publick Invasion , may perhaps be thought necessary , but yet one could always wish for an Army of regular Troops : I should not have touched upon this Circumstance , but to obviate some Imputations , which he had suggested , of my Writing several Pieces , which I never heard of , till I saw them with the rest of the Town : But these Suggestions shall be considered in the Preface to the next Epistle , in which , among other Things , I intend to state several Matters of Fact , in Contradiction to the Notes of the Dunciad , particularly as they concern the Writers of the following Poem .</p>

   <p>P — pe ’ s Reputation for versifying is a vulgar Error , founded only on discreet Theft : Half a Line from Mr. Dryden ’ s Conquest of Mexico , and another from his Translation of Virgil , have seemingly made tolerable Music , when join ’ d in his Works ; but Music of the Morocco Kind , which has but one Note .</p>

   <p>Mr. Wycherley subscribed to a Compliment ( some say , before his Death ) upon P — pe ’ s Pastorals , in which he says , his Arcadia speaks the Language of the Mall , but does not explain , whether he means at Noon or Night . I do not agree with what Mr. Wycherley is supposed to have writ of him , but I do with what he certainly said of him , viz . That he was not able to make a Suit of Cloaths , but could perhaps turn an old Coat .</p>

   <note>[ Decoration ] * * * * [ Transcriber ’ s Note : Footnotes are here shown between stanzas . The labels ( a , b , c ) are unchanged . ] The BLATANT-BEAST . a POEM . What is that Blatant-Beast ? Then he reply ’ d . It is a Monster bred of hellish Race , Then answered he , which often hath annoy ’ d Good Knights and Ladies true , and many else destroy ’ d . SPENCER ’ s Fairy Queen , Book VI . Canto I . No Might , no Greatness in Mortality Can Censure ’ scape : Back-wounding Calumny The whitest Virtue strikes . What King so strong , Can tye the Gall up in sland ’ rous Tongue ? SHAKESPEAR . [ Decoration ] LONDON : Printed for J. ROBINSON , at the Golden Lyon in Ludgate-street . MDCCXLII . [ Decoration ] The BLATANT-BEAST a POEM . Beauty , the fondling Mother ’ s earliest Pray ’ r , Nature ’ s kind Gift to sweeten worldly Care . Beauty the greatest Extasy imparts , Steals thro ’ our Eyes , and revels in our Hearts ; Adds Lustre to a Crown , gives Weight to Sense , The Orator assists in Truth ’ s Defence . The very Fool our Hearts resistless warms , And while we curse the Tongue , the Figure charms . If Beauty be the Subject of our Praise , A rude , mishapen Lump Contempt must raise . When Lucifer with Angels held first Place , Seraphic Beauty sparkled in his Face . By Pride and Malice tempted to rebel , Vengeance pursu ’ d him to the lowest Hell : Not sulph ’ rous Lakes suffic ’ d , nor dreary Plains ; Deformity was join ’ d t ’ improve his Pains . Paint then the Person , and expose the Mind , Who rails at others , to his own Faults blind . Sly Sancho ’ s Paunch , meagre Don Quixot ’ s Love , The Satyr and the Ridicule improve . So when fam ’ d Butler wou ’ d Rebellion paint , He lasht the Traitor and the Mimic Saint . Sir Hudibras he sung ; the crumpled Wight , Contempt and Laughter ever will excite . The Blatant-Beast once more has broke his Chains , Disperses Falshoods , and remorseless reigns . Scornful of all thy Verses dare design , ( Where useless Epithets crowd ev ’ ry Line ,) The Blatant-Beast shall be afresh pursu ’ d , Nor cease my Labours till again subdu ’ d . Distorted Elf ! to Nature a Disgrace , Thy Mind envenom ’ d pictur ’ d in thy Face ; Malice with Envy in thy Breast combines , And in thy Visage grav ’ d those ghastly Lines . Like Plagues , like Death thy ranc ’ rous Arrows fly , At Good and Bad , at Friend and Enemy . To thy own Breast recoils the erring Dart , Corrupts thy Blood , and rankles in thy Heart . There swell the Poisons which thy Breast distend , And with the Load thy Mountain Shoulders bend . Horrid to view ! retire from human Sight , Nor with thy Figure pregnant Dames affright . Crawl thro ’ thy childish Grot , growl round thy Grove , A Foe to Man , an Antidote to Love . In Curses waste thy Time instead of Pray ’ r , ( a ) And with thy Breath pollute the fragrant Air . There doze o ’ er Shakespear ; then thy Blunders fell ( b ) At mighty Price ; this Truth let Tonson tell . Then frontless intimate , ( oh perjur ’ d Bard ! ) Thy Labours were bestow ’ d without Reward . On that immortal Author wreak thy Spite , ( c ) And on his Monument thy Nonsense write . Should Theobald thy presumptuous Errors shew , Be thou to Theobald an invet ’ rate Foe . Cibber shall foremost in thy Satyrs stand ; His Plays succeed , and thine was justly damn ’ d . But Colley call him , when thou would ’ st declame ; Great is the Jest that lies in Colley ’ s Name . [ Footnote a : It is surely allowable to treat a Man after this manner who abuses all others , and to make this just Reflexion , since in his new Dunciad he not only calls Mummius a Fool , but uses this filthy Expression — who stinks above the Ground . ] [ Footnote b : See this farther explained in the ingenious Dialogues of Sawney and Colley . ] [ Footnote c : Tho ’ he was informed that Wreck was improper , yet he was resolv ’ d it should be inscrib ’ d , because the Nonsense was in his Edition of Shakespear . ] Beware all ye , whom he as Friends carest , How ye entrust your Secrets to his Breast . ( a ) On Backs of Letters was his Homer wrote , All your Affairs disclos ’ d to save a Groat . He valu ’ d not to whom he gave Offence ; He sav ’ d his Paper , tho ’ at your Expence . [ Footnote a : When he sent his Homer to his Acquaintance for their Emendations , it was written on the Back of the Letters of his Correspondents , whether of Business , Complement or Secrecy . A shameful Instance of Avarice and Treachery ! ] But shall a low-born Wretch the best traduce , And call it Poetry , because Abuse ? The Heav ’ n-born Muse , by Truth and Justice sway ’ d , To false Aspersions ne ’ er vouchsafes her Aid . When unprovok ’ d , not vengeful Wasps molest , Nor dart their Stings , when undisturb ’ d their Nest . Thy Muse , by Virgil ’ s Harpies taught to write , Scatters her Ordure in her screaming Flight ; Sacred Religion and her Priests defames , And against Monarchs saucily exclames . ( a ) The Fathers , of our Church the surest Guides , As a poor Pack of Punsters she derides . But chief O Cam ! and Isis ! dread her Frown , ( b ) Chain ’ d to the Footstool of the Goddess ’ Throne . No Order , no Degree escapes her Rage , And dull , and dull , and dull swells ev ’ ry Page . Thirsty , she Poison draws from ev ’ ry Flow ’ r , Like Satan , seeks whom next she may devour . [ Footnote a : Vide Notes on the new Dunciad . ] [ Footnote b : Goddess of Dullness . ] So have I seen a Dog distracted roam ; He bites , he snaps at all , disgorging Foam . The frighten ’ d Passenger the Danger flies , And sees the Poison flashing from his Eyes . Till some stout Dray-man dashes out his Brains , And his corrupted Blood the Kennel stains . Thy Notes pedantic shall no more engage ; Arbuthnot ’ s Wit enlivens not the Page . Thy Muse , that Prostitute abandon ’ d Jade , Now flounders in the Mire without Swift ’ s Aid . Thy base Invectives Men no more regard ; With just Disdain thy Scare-Crow Muse is heard . So when the latent Seeds their Fruits display , And gain fresh Vigour from a genial Ray : The careful Hind a monst ’ rous Figure frames ; From various Rags unwonted Terror streams . The feather ’ d Choristers in Flocks retreat , And at a Distance view the tempting Bait . At length grown bold , they perch upon his Head , And with their Meute bedawb what late they fled . B-ns-n abuse for raising Milton ’ s Bust , And impiously molest learn ’ d Johnston ’ s Dust . Religious , he the Psalms in Latin sung , From hence the Malice of the Deist sprung . While with a just Derision we survey , Thy wretched Epitaph on poor John Gay . Had Peter , Charters thee with Gold supply ’ d , Peter and Charters had been deify ’ d . But ev ’ ry Lord , each gen ’ rous Friend implore , And by Subscriptions meanly swell thy Store . When to the Town by sordid Int ’ rest led , Mump for a Dinner , flatter for a Bed . Then to thy Grot retire , indulge thy Spite , And rail at those who for Subsistence write . Summon thy Rags , invoke thy scurril Muse , With keenest Malice Addison abuse . Sculking , the Scandal privately disperse , ( a ) Then own in Prose the Baseness of thy Verse . [ Footnote a : He writ a vile Lampoon on Mr. Addison , and then in a Preface owns , he deserves Respect from every Lover of Learning . ] So e ’ re Arachne to her Cell repairs , Insidiously she weaves her glewy Snares . Sullen , she meditates on Deaths to come , And meliorates the Poison in her Womb . ( b ) Should hapless Clarion thither take his Flight , He falls her Prey , mindful of ancient Spite . [ Footnote b : Vide Spencer ’ s Fate of the Butterfly . ] With Malice swoll ’ n , Pride , Envy , Avarice , Ingratitude attends this Train to Vice . Yet one remains untold ; with Lust endu ’ d , Behold the Fribler lab ’ ring to be lewd . Kind Cibber interpos ’ d , forbad the Banns , He ’ d peopled else this Isle with Calibans . ( a ) The noble Timon , in thy waspish Strains , A Proof of thy Ingratitude remains . Courteous to all , munificent , humane , Subject of others Praise , to thee of Pain . Exalted far above thy groveling State , The Object of his Pity , not his Hate . He smiles at Scandal so unjustly thrown , And at thy Malice he disdains to frown . [ Footnote a : Vide a Poem on Taste . ] Thus oft we see a currish , Mungrel Crew , A stately Mastiff eagerly pursue . They swarm around , they yelp , they snarl , they grin , Bold in Appearance , timerous within : With such mean Foes he deigns not to engage , But lifts his Leg , and pisses out their Rage . How dar ’ st thou , Peasant , give thy Pen this Loose ? Becomes it thee thus madly to traduce ? The Great , the Low , the Virtuous , and the Base , Alike are grown thy Subject of Disgrace . Safe in thy Weakness , thou defi ’ st a Foe ; E ’ en ( b ) Cibber ’ s Cudgel scorn ’ d to stoop so low . The Mercy of the Law restrains thy Fears ; Coventry ’ s Act secures thy Nose and Ears . Yet there remains , to fill thy Soul with Care , A Blanket to curvet thee in the Air . [ Footnote b : Vide Cibber ’ s Letter to Pope . ] O wretched Life consum ’ d in restless Pains , Where Dread of Punishment incessant reigns ! Poor Self-Tormentor ! in whose gloomy Breast The Vulture dwells , inhospitable Guest . Be to my Foe no greater Curse assign ’ d ! Than a malignant Heart and envious Mind . Thrice happy he ! that ’ s with Good Nature blest , Love of his Species rules his tender Breast ; Nor there confin ’ d : The Brute Creation share His kind Beneficence and gen ’ rous Care . No base malicious Thoughts his Peace annoy : Are others happy ? he partakes their Joy . Chearful and innocent the Day he spends , And Silver Sleep his quiet Nights attends . But thou , a Stranger to this Peace of Mind , Search where thou may ’ st conspicuous Merit find : There strive to blacken with thy utmost Art , And rail the more , the greater the Desert . Is there a Man , an Honour to the Age , Unsully ’ d by the keenest Party-rage ; By Vice untainted ; who , from early Youth , Firmly adher ’ d to Honour , Justice , Truth ; Whom no unruly Passions e ’ re cou ’ d blind , Nor ruffle his Serenity of Mind ; His Country ’ s Good , the Patriot ’ s noblest View , Unbrib ’ d , unaw ’ d , does stedfastly pursue ; Polite in Manners , and rever ’ d his Sense , And long in Senates fam ’ d for Eloquence ; But if to these Endowments of the Mind , A graceful Figure happily is join ’ d , Then flows thy Gall , then raves thy half-form ’ d Clay , Then frets thy putrid Carcass to Decay . So when the croaking Toad the Ox beheld , His envious Heart with Indignation swell ’ d . Vainly the Reptil thought he could extend His bloated Form , and Nature ’ s Error mend . He drew his Breath ; he swell ’ d — he burst ; he dy ’ d A Victim to his Arrogance and Pride .</note>
