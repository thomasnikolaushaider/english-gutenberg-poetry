   <p>BELPHEGOR ADDRESSED TO MISS DE CHAMMELAY</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">YOUR name with ev'ry pleasure here I place ,</l>
     <l n="2">The last effusions of my muse to grace .</l>
     <l n="3">O charming Phillis ! may the same extend</l>
     <l n="4">Through time 's dark night : our praise together blend ;</l>
     <l n="5">To this we surely may pretend to aim</l>
     <l n="6">Your acting and my rhymes attention claim .</l>
     <l n="7">Long , long in mem'ry ' s page your fame shall live ;</l>
     <l n="8">You , who such ecstacy so often give ;</l>
     <l n="9">O'er minds , o'er hearts triumphantly you reign :</l>
     <l n="10">In Berenice , in Phaedra , and Chimene ,</l>
     <l n="11">Your tears and plaintive accents all engage :</l>
     <l n="12">Beyond compare in proud Camilla 's rage ;</l>
     <l n="13">Your voice and manner auditors delight ;</l>
     <l n="14">Who strong emotions can so well excite ?</l>
     <l n="15">No fine eulogium from my pen expect :</l>
     <l n="16">With you each air and grace appear correct</l>
     <l n="17">My first of Phillis 's you ought to be ;</l>
     <l n="18">My sole affection had been placed on thee ;</l>
     <l n="19">Long since , had I presumed the truth to tell ;</l>
     <l n="20">But he who loves would fain be loved as well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="21">NO hope of gaining such a charming fair ,</l>
     <l n="22">Too soon , perhaps , I ceded to despair ;</l>
     <l n="23">Your friend , was all I ventured to be thought ,</l>
     <l n="24">Though in your net I more than half was caught .</l>
     <l n="25">Most willingly your lover I 'd have been ;</l>
     <l n="26">But time it is our story should be seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">ONE , day , old Satan , sov'reign dread of hell ;</l>
     <l n="28">Reviewed his subjects , as our hist'ries tell ;</l>
     <l n="29">The diff'rent ranks , confounded as they stood ,</l>
     <l n="30">Kings , nobles , females , and plebeian blood ,</l>
     <l n="31">Such grief expressed , and made such horrid cries ,</l>
     <l n="32">As almost stunned , and filled him with surprise .</l>
     <l n="33">The monarch , as he passed , desired to know</l>
     <l n="34">The cause that sent each shade to realms below .</l>
     <l n="35">Some said — my HUSBAND ; others WIFE replied ;</l>
     <l n="36">The same was echoed loud from ev'ry side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">His majesty on this was heard to say :</l>
     <l n="38">If truth these shadows to my ears convey ,</l>
     <l n="39">With ease our glory we may now augment :</l>
     <l n="40">I 'm fully bent to try th ’ experiment .</l>
     <l n="41">With this design we must some demon send ,</l>
     <l n="42">Who wily art with prudence well can blend ;</l>
     <l n="43">And , not content with watching Hymen 's flock ,</l>
     <l n="44">Must add his own experience to the stock .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">THE sable senate instantly approved</l>
     <l n="46">The proposition that the monarch moved ;</l>
     <l n="47">Belphegor was to execute the work ;</l>
     <l n="48">The proper talent in him seemed to lurk :</l>
     <l n="49">All ears and eyes , a prying knave in grain</l>
     <l n="50">In short , the very thing they wished to gain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">THAT he might all expense and cost defray ,</l>
     <l n="52">They gave him num'rous bills without delay ,</l>
     <l n="53">And credit too , in ev'ry place of note ,</l>
     <l n="54">With various things that might their plan promote .</l>
     <l n="55">He was , besides , the human lot to fill ,</l>
     <l n="56">Of pleasure and of pain :— of good and ill ;</l>
     <l n="57">In fact , whate'er for mortals was designed ,</l>
     <l n="58">With his legation was to be combined .</l>
     <l n="59">He might by industry and wily art ,</l>
     <l n="60">His own afflictions dissipate in part ;</l>
     <l n="61">But die he could not , nor his country see ,</l>
     <l n="62">Till he ten years complete on earth should be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="63">BEHOLD him trav'lling o'er th ’ extensive space ;</l>
     <l n="64">Between the realms of darkness and our race .</l>
     <l n="65">To pass it , scarcely he a moment took ;</l>
     <l n="66">On Florence instantly he cast a look ;—</l>
     <l n="67">Delighted with the beauty of the spot ,</l>
     <l n="68">He there resolved to fix his earthly lot ,</l>
     <l n="69">Regarding it as proper for his wiles ,</l>
     <l n="70">A city famed for wanton freaks and guiles .</l>
     <l n="71">Belphegor soon a noble mansion hired ,</l>
     <l n="72">And furnished it with ev'ry thing desired ;</l>
     <l n="73">As signor Roderick he designed to pass ;</l>
     <l n="74">His equipage was large of ev'ry class ;</l>
     <l n="75">Expense anticipating day by day ,</l>
     <l n="76">What , in ten years , he had to throw away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="77">HIS noble entertainments raised surprise ;</l>
     <l n="78">Magnificence alone would not suffice ;</l>
     <l n="79">Delightful pleasures he dispensed around ,</l>
     <l n="80">And flattery abundantly was found ,</l>
     <l n="81">An art in which a demon should excel :</l>
     <l n="82">No devil surely e'er was liked so well .</l>
     <l n="83">His heart was soon the object of the FAIR ;</l>
     <l n="84">To please Belphegor was their constant care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="85">WHO lib'rally with presents smoothes the road ,</l>
     <l n="86">Will meet no obstacles to LOVE 'S abode .</l>
     <l n="87">In ev'ry situation they are sweet ,</l>
     <l n="88">I 've often said , and now the same repeat :</l>
     <l n="89">The primum mobile of human kind ,</l>
     <l n="90">Are gold and silver , through the world we find .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="91">OUR envoy kept two books , in which he wrote</l>
     <l n="92">The names of all the married pairs of note ;</l>
     <l n="93">But that assigned to couples satisfied ,</l>
     <l n="94">He scarcely for it could a name provide ,</l>
     <l n="95">Which made the demon almost blush to see ,</l>
     <l n="96">How few , alas ! in wedlock 's chains agree ;</l>
     <l n="97">While presently the other , which contained</l>
     <l n="98">Th ’ unhappy — not a leaf in blank remained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="99">No other choice Belphegor now had got ,</l>
     <l n="100">Than — try himself the hymeneal knot .</l>
     <l n="101">In Florence he beheld a certain fair ,</l>
     <l n="102">With charming face and smart engaging air ;</l>
     <l n="103">Of noble birth , but puffed with empty pride ;</l>
     <l n="104">Some marks of virtue , though not much beside .</l>
     <l n="105">For Roderick was asked this lofty dame ;</l>
     <l n="106">The father said Honesta * ( such her name )</l>
     <l n="107">Had many eligible offers found ;</l>
     <l n="108">But , ‘ mong the num'rous band that hovered round ,</l>
     <l n="109">Perhaps his daughter , Rod'rick ' s suit might take ,</l>
     <l n="110">Though he should wish for time the choice to make .</l>
     <l n="111">This approbation met , and Rod'rick ‘ gan</l>
     <l n="112">To use his arts and execute his plan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="113">THE entertainments , balls , and serenades ,</l>
     <l n="114">Plays , concerts , presents , feasts , and masquerades ,</l>
     <l n="115">Much lessened what the demon with him brought ;</l>
     <l n="116">He nothing grudged :— whate'er was wished he bought .</l>
     <l n="117">The dame believed high honour she bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="118">When she attention to his offer showed ;</l>
     <l n="119">And , after prayers , entreaties , and the rest ,</l>
     <l n="120">To be his wife she full assent expressed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="121">BUT first a pettifogger to him came ,</l>
     <l n="122">Of whom ( aside ) Belphegor made a game ;</l>
     <l n="123">What ! said the demon , is a lady gained</l>
     <l n="124">just like a house ?— these scoundrels have obtained</l>
     <l n="125">Such pow'r and sway , without them nothing 's done ;</l>
     <l n="126">But hell will get them when their course is run .</l>
     <l n="127">He reasoned properly ; when faith 's no more ,</l>
     <l n="128">True honesty is forced to leave the door ;</l>
     <l n="129">When men with confidence no longer view</l>
     <l n="130">Their fellow-mortals ,— happiness adieu !</l>
     <l n="131">The very means we use t ’ escape the snare ,</l>
     <l n="132">Oft deeper plunge us in the gulph of care ;</l>
     <l n="133">Avoid attorneys , if you comfort crave</l>
     <l n="134">Who knows a PETTIFOGGER , knows a KNAVE ;</l>
     <l n="135">Their contracts , filled with IFS and FORS , appear</l>
     <l n="136">The gate through which STRIFE found admittance here .</l>
     <l n="137">In vain we hope again the earth ‘ twill leave</l>
     <l n="138">Still STRIFE remains , and we ourselves deceive :</l>
     <l n="139">In spite of solemn forms and laws we see ,</l>
     <l n="140">That LOVE and HYMEN often disagree .</l>
     <l n="141">The heart alone can tranquilize the mind ;</l>
     <l n="142">In mutual passion ev'ry bliss we find .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="143">HOW diff'rent things in other states appear !</l>
     <l n="144">With friends — ‘ tis who can be the most sincere ;</l>
     <l n="145">With lovers — all is sweetness , balm of life ;</l>
     <l n="146">While all is IRKSOMENESS with man and wife .</l>
     <l n="147">We daily see from DUTY springs disgust ,</l>
     <l n="148">And PLEASURE likes true LIBERTY to trust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="149">ARE happy marriages for ever flown ?</l>
     <l n="150">On full consideration I will own ,</l>
     <l n="151">That when each other 's follies couples bear ;</l>
     <l n="152">They then deserve the name of HAPPY PAIR .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="153">ENOUGH of this :— no sooner had our wight</l>
     <l n="154">The belle possessed , and passed the month 's delight ;</l>
     <l n="155">But he perceived what marriage must be here ,</l>
     <l n="156">With such a demon in our nether sphere .</l>
     <l n="157">For ever jars and discords rang around ;</l>
     <l n="158">Of follies , ev'ry class our couple found ;</l>
     <l n="159">Honesta often times such noise would make ,</l>
     <l n="160">Her screams and cries the neighbours kept awake ,</l>
     <l n="161">Who , running thither , by the wife were told :—</l>
     <l n="162">Some paltry tradesman 's daughter , coarse and bold ,</l>
     <l n="163">He should have had :— not one of rank like me ;</l>
     <l n="164">To treat me thus , what villain he must be !</l>
     <l n="165">A wife so virtuous , could he e'er deserve !</l>
     <l n="166">My scruples are too great , or I should swerve ;</l>
     <l n="167">Indeed , without dispute , ‘ twould serve him right :—</l>
     <l n="168">We are not sure she nothing did in spite ;</l>
     <l n="169">These prudes can make us credit what they please :</l>
     <l n="170">Few ponder long when they can dupe with ease .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="171">THIS wife and husband , as our hist'ries say ,</l>
     <l n="172">Each moment squabbled through the passing day ;</l>
     <l n="173">Their disagreements often would arise</l>
     <l n="174">About a petticoat , cards , tables , pies ,</l>
     <l n="175">Gowns , chairs , dice , summer-houses , in a word ,</l>
     <l n="176">Things most ridiculous and quite absurd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="177">WELL might this spouse regret his Hell profound ,</l>
     <l n="178">When he considered what he 'd met on ground .</l>
     <l n="179">To make our demon 's wretchedness complete ,</l>
     <l n="180">Honesta 's relatives , from ev'ry street ,</l>
     <l n="181">He seemed to marry , since he daily fed</l>
     <l n="182">The father , mother , sister ( fit to wed ,)</l>
     <l n="183">And little brother , whom he sent to school ;</l>
     <l n="184">While MISS he portioned to a wealthy fool .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="185">His utter ruin , howsoe'er , arose</l>
     <l n="186">From his attorney-steward that he chose .</l>
     <l n="187">What 's that ? you ask — a wily sneaking knave ,</l>
     <l n="188">Who , while his master spends , contrives to save ;</l>
     <l n="189">Till , in the end , grown rich , the lands he buys ,</l>
     <l n="190">Which his good lord is forced to sacrifice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="191">IF , in the course of time , the master take</l>
     <l n="192">The place of steward , and his fortune make ,</l>
     <l n="193">‘ Twould only to their proper rank restore ,</l>
     <l n="194">Those who become just what they were before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="195">POOR Rod'rick now no other hope had got ,</l>
     <l n="196">Than what the chance of traffick might allot ;</l>
     <l n="197">Illusion vain , or doubtful at the best :—</l>
     <l n="198">Though some grow rich , yet all are not so blessed .</l>
     <l n="199">‘ Twas said our husband never would succeed ;</l>
     <l n="200">And truly , such it seemed to be decreed .</l>
     <l n="201">His agents ( similar to those we see</l>
     <l n="202">In modern days ) were with his treasure free ;</l>
     <l n="203">His ships were wrecked ; his commerce came to naught ;</l>
     <l n="204">Deceived by knaves , of whom he well had thought ;</l>
     <l n="205">Obliged to borrow money , which to pay ,</l>
     <l n="206">He was unable at th ’ appointed day ,</l>
     <l n="207">He fled , and with a farmer shelter took ,</l>
     <l n="208">Where he might hope the bailiffs would not look .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="209">HE told to Matthew , ( such the farmer 's name ,)</l>
     <l n="210">His situation , character , and fame :</l>
     <l n="211">By duns assailed , and harassed by a wife ,</l>
     <l n="212">Who proved the very torment of his life ,</l>
     <l n="213">He knew no place of safety to obtain ,</l>
     <l n="214">Like ent'ring other bodies , where ‘ twas plain ,</l>
     <l n="215">He might escape the catchpole 's prowling eye ,</l>
     <l n="216">Honesta 's wrath , and all her rage defy .</l>
     <l n="217">From these he promised he would thrice retire ;</l>
     <l n="218">Whenever Matthew should the same desire :</l>
     <l n="219">Thrice , but no more , t'oblige this worthy man ,</l>
     <l n="220">Who shelter gave when from the fiends he ran .</l>

     <l n="221">THE AMBASSADOR commenced his form to change :—</l>
     <l n="222">From human frame to frame he ‘ gan to range ;</l>
     <l n="223">But what became his own fantastick state ,</l>
     <l n="224">Our books are silent , nor the facts relate .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="225">AN only daughter was the first he seized ,</l>

     <l n="228">Obliged him , at a word , to quit his hold .</l>
     <l n="229">This passed at Naples — next to Rome he came ,</l>
     <l n="230">Where , with another fair , he did the same ;</l>
     <l n="231">But still the farmer banished him again ,</l>
     <l n="232">So well he could the devil 's will restrain ;</l>
     <l n="233">Another weighty purse to him was paid</l>
     <l n="234">Thrice Matthew drove him out from belle and maid .</l>
