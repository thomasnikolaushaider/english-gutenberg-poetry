    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">To edit an English classic for study in secondary schools is difficult . The lack of anything like uniformity in the type of examination required by the colleges and universities complicates treatment . Not only do two distinct institutions differ in the scope and character of their questions , but the same university varies its demands from year to year . The only safe course to pursue is , therefore , a generally comprehensive one . But here , again , we are hampered by limited space , and are forced to content ourselves with a bare outline , which the individual instructor can fill in as much or as little as he pleases .</p>
    <p n="2">The ignorance of most of our classical students in regard to the history of English literature is appalling ; and yet it is impossible properly to study a given work of a given author without some knowledge of the background against which that particular writer stands . I have , therefore , sketched the politics , society , and literature of the age in which Dryden lived , and during which he gave to the world his Palamon and Arcite . In the critical comments of the introduction I have contented myself with little more than hints . That particular line of study , whether it concerns the poet 's style , his verse forms , or the possession of the divine instinct itself , can be much more satisfactorily developed by the instructor , as the student 's knowledge of the poem grows .</p>
    <p n="3">It is certainly a subject for congratulation that so many youth will be introduced , through the medium of Dryden 's crisp and vigorous verse , to one of the tales of Chaucer . May it now , as in his own century , accomplish the poet 's desire , and awaken in them appreciative admiration for the old bard , the best story-teller in the English language .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="4">THE BACKGROUND .</p>
    <p n="5">The fifty years of Dryden 's literary production just fill the last half of the seventeenth century . It was a period bristling with violent political and religious prejudices , provocative of strife that amounted to revolution . Its social life ran the gamut from the severity of the Commonwealth Puritan to the unbridled debauchery of the Restoration Courtier . In literature it experienced a remarkable transformation in poetry , and developed modern prose , watched the production of the greatest English epics , smarted under the lash of the greatest English satires , blushed at the brilliant wit of unspeakable comedies , and applauded the beginnings of English criticism .</p>
    <p n="6">When the period began , England was a Commonwealth . Charles I ., by obstinate insistence upon absolutism , by fickleness and faithlessness , had increased and strengthened his enemies . Parliament had seized the reins of government in 1642 , had completely established its authority at Naseby in 1645 , and had beheaded the king in front of his own palace in 1649 . The army had accomplished these results , and the army proposed to enjoy the reward . Cromwell , the idolized commander of the Ironsides , was placed at the head of the new-formed state with the title of Lord Protector ; and for five years he ruled England , as she had been ruled by no sovereign since Elizabeth . He suppressed Parliamentary dissensions and royalist uprisings , humbled the Dutch , took vengeance on the Spaniard , and made England indisputably mistress of the ocean . He was succeeded , at his death in 1658 , by his son Richard ; but the father 's strong instinct for government had not been inherited by the son . The nation , homesick for monarchy , was tiring of dissension and bickering , and by the Restoration of 1660 the son of Charles I became Charles II of England .</p>
    <p n="7">Scarcely had the demonstrations of joy at the Restoration subsided when London was visited by the devouring plague of 1665 . All who could fled from the stricken city where thousands died in a day . In 1666 came the great fire which swept from the Tower to the Temple ; but , while it destroyed a vast deal of property , it prevented by its violent purification a recurrence of the plague , and made possible the rebuilding of the city with great sanitary and architectural improvements .</p>
    <p n="8">Charles possessed some of the virtues of the Stuarts and most of their faults . His arbitrary irresponsibility shook the confidence of the nation in his sincerity . Two parties , the Whigs and the Tories , came into being , and party spirit and party strife ran high . The question at issue was chiefly one of religion . The rank and file of Protestant England was determined against the revival of Romanism , which a continuation of the Stuart line seemed to threaten . Charles was a Protestant only from expediency , and on his deathbed accepted the Roman Catholic faith ; his brother James , Duke of York , the heir apparent , was a professed Romanist .</p>
    <p n="9">Such an outlook incited the Whigs , under the leadership of Shaftesbury , to support the claims of Charles ’ eldest illegitimate son , the Duke of Monmouth , who , on the death of his father in 1685 , landed in England ; but the promised uprising was scarcely more than a rabble of peasantry , and was easily suppressed . Then came the vengeance of James , as foolish as it was tyrannical . Judge Jeffries and his bloody assizes sent scores of Protestants to the block or to the gallows , till England would endure no more . William , Prince of Orange , who had married Mary , the eldest daughter of James , was invited to accept the English crown . He landed at Torbay , was joined by Churchill , the commander of the king 's forces , and , on the precipitate flight of James , mounted the throne of England . This event stands in history as the Protestant Revolution of 1688 .</p>
    <p n="10">During William 's reign , which terminated in 1702 , Stuart uprisings were successfully suppressed , English liberties were guaranteed by the famous Bill of Rights , Protestant succession was assured , and liberal toleration was extended to the various dissenting sects .</p>
    <p n="11">Society had passed through quite as great variations as had politics during this half-century . The roistering Cavalier of the first Charles , with his flowing locks and plumed hat , with his maypoles and morrice dances , with his stage plays and bear-baitings , with his carousals and gallantries , had given way to the Puritan Roundhead . It was a serious , sober-minded England in which the youth Dryden found himself . If the Puritan differed from the Cavalier in political principles , they were even more diametrically opposed in mode of life . An Act of Parliament closed the theaters in 1642 . Amusements of all kinds were frowned upon as frivolous , and many were suppressed by law . The old English feasts at Michaelmas , Christmas , Twelfth Night , and Candlemas were regarded as relics of popery and were condemned . The Puritan took his religion seriously , so seriously that it overpowered him . The energy and fervor of his religious life were illustrated in the work performed by Cromwell 's chaplain , John Howe , on any one of the countless fast days . “ He began with his flock at nine in the morning , prayed during a quarter of an hour for blessing upon the day 's work , then read and explained a chapter for three-quarters of an hour , then prayed for an hour , preached for an hour , and prayed again for a half an hour , then retired for a quarter of an hour 's refreshment — the people singing all the while — returned to his pulpit , prayed for another hour , preached for another hour , and finished at four P. M . ”</p>
    <p n="12">At the Restoration the pendulum swung back again . From the strained morality of the Puritans there was a sudden leap to the most extravagant license and the grossest immorality , with the king and the court in the van . The theaters were thrown wide open , women for the first time went upon the stage , and they acted in plays whose moral tone is so low that they cannot now be presented on the stage or read in the drawing-room . Of course they voiced the social conditions of the time . Marriage ties were lightly regarded ; no gallant but boasted his amours . Revelry ran riot ; drunkenness became a habit and gambling a craze . The court scintillated with brilliant wits , conscienceless libertines , and scoffing atheists . It was an age of debauchery and disbelief .</p>
    <p n="13">The splendor of this life sometimes dazzles , the lack of conveniences appalls . The post left London once a week . A journey to the country must be made in your own lumbering carriage , or on the snail-slow stagecoach over miserable roads , beset with highwaymen . The narrow , ill-lighted streets , even of London , could not be traversed safely at night ; and ladies , borne to routs and levees in their sedan chairs , were lighted by link-boys , and were carried by stalwart , broad-shouldered bearers who could wield well the staves in a street fight . Such were the conditions of life and society which Dryden found in the last fifty years of the seventeenth century .</p>
    <p n="14">Strong as were the contrasts in politics and manners during Dryden 's lifetime , they were paralleled by contrasts in literature no less marked . Dryden was born in 1631 ; he died in 1700 . In the year of his birth died John Donne , the father of the Metaphysical bards , or Marinists ; in the year of his death was born James Thomson , who was to give the first real start to the Romantic movement ; while between these two dates lies the period devoted to the development of French Classicism in English literature .</p>
    <p n="15">At Dryden 's birth Ben Jonson was the only one of the great Elizabethan dramatists still living , and of the lesser stars in the same galaxy , Chapman , Massinger , Ford , Webster , and Heywood all died during his boyhood and youth , while Shirley , the last of his line , lingered till 1667 . Of the older writers in prose , Selden alone remained ; but as Dryden grew to manhood , he had at hand , fresh from the printers , the whole wealth of Commonwealth prose , still somewhat clumsy with Latinism or tainted with Euphuism , but working steadily toward that simple strength and graceful fluency with which he was himself to mark the beginning of modern English prose .</p>
    <p n="16">Clarendon , with his magnificently involved style , began his famous History of the Great Rebellion in 1641 . Ten years later Hobbes published the Leviathan , a sketch of an ideal commonwealth . Baxter , with his Saints ’ Everlasting Rest sent a book of religious consolation into every household . In 1642 Dr. Thomas Browne , with the simplicity of a child and a quaintness that fascinates , published his Religio Medici ; and in 1653 dear old simple-hearted Isaak Walton told us in his Compleat Angler how to catch , dress , and cook fish . Thomas Fuller , born a score or more of years before Dryden , in the same town , Aldwinkle , published in 1642 his Holy and Profane State , a collection of brief and brisk character sketches , which come nearer modern prose than anything of that time ; while for inspired thought and purity of diction the Holy Living , 1650 , and the Holy Dying , 1651 , of Jeremy Taylor , a gifted young divine , rank preëminent in the prose of the Commonwealth .</p>
    <p n="17">But without question the ablest prose of the period came from the pen of Cromwell 's Latin Secretary of State , John Milton . Milton stands in his own time a peculiarly isolated figure . We never in thought associate him with his contemporaries . Dryden had become the leading literary figure in London before Milton wrote his great epic ; yet , were it not for definite chronology , we should scarcely realize that they worked in the same century . While , therefore , no sketch of seventeenth-century literature can exclude Milton , he must be taken by himself , without relation to the development , forms , and spirit of his age , and must be regarded , rather , as a late-born Elizabethan .</p>
    <p n="18">When Dryden was born , Milton at twenty-three was just completing his seven years at Cambridge , and as the younger poet grew through boyhood , the elder was enriching English verse with his Juvenilia . Then came the twenty years of strife . As Secretary of the Commonwealth , he threw himself into controversial prose . His Iconoclast , the Divorce pamphlets , the Smectymnuus tracts , and the Areopagitica date from this period . A strong partisan of the Commonwealth , he was in emphatic disfavor at the Restoration . Blind and in hiding , deserted by one-time friends , out of sympathy with his age , he fulfilled the promise of his youth : he turned again to poetry ; and in Paradise Lost , Paradise Regained , and Samson Agonistes he has left us “ something so written that the world shall not willingly let it die . ”</p>
    <p n="19">I have said that Milton 's poetry differed distinctly from the poetry of his age . The verse that Dryden was reading as a schoolboy was quite other than L'Allegro and Lycidas . In the closing years of the preceding century , John Donne had traveled in Italy . There the poet Marino was developing fantastic eccentricities in verse . Donne under similar influences adopted similar methods .</p>
    <p n="20">To seize upon the quaintest possible thought and then to express it in as quaint a manner as possible became the chief aim of English poets during the first three-quarters of the seventeenth century . Donne had encountered trouble in obtaining his wife from her father . Finding one morning a flea that had feasted during the night on his wife and himself , he was overcome by its poetic possibilities , and wrote :</p>
    <p n="21">“ This flea is you and I , and this Our marriage bed and temple is ; Tho ’ parents frown , and you , we 're met And cloister 'd in these living walls of jet . ”</p>
    <p n="22">To strain after conceits , to strive for quaintness of thought and expression , was the striking characteristic of all the poets of the generation , to whom Dr. Johnson gave the title Metaphysical , and who are now known as the Marinists . There were Quarles , with his Dutch Emblems ; Vaughan , Sandys , Crashaw , and pure-souled George Herbert , with his Temple . There were Carew , with the Rapture ; Wither and his “ Shall I wasting in despair ” ; the two dashing Cavaliers Suckling and Lovelace , the latter the only man who ever received an M. A . for his personal beauty . There was Herrick , the dispossessed Devonshire rector , with Hesperides and Noble Numbers , freer than were the others from the beauty-marring conceits of the time . There , too , were to be found the gallant love-maker Waller , Cowley , the queen 's secretary during her exile , and Marvell , Milton 's assistant Secretary of State . But these three men were to pledge allegiance to a new sovereignty in English verse .</p>
    <p n="23">In the civil strife , Waller had at first sided with Parliament , had later engaged in a plot against it , and after a year 's imprisonment was exiled to France . At this time the Academy , organized to introduce form and method in the French language and literature , held full sway . Malherbe was inculcating its principles , Corneille and Molière were practicing its tenets in their plays , and Boileau was following its rules in his satires , when Waller and his associates came in contact with this influence . The tendency was distinctly toward formality and conventionality . Surfeited with the eccentricities and far-fetched conceits of the Marinists , the exiled Englishmen welcomed the change ; they espoused the French principles ; and when at the Restoration they returned to England with their king , whose taste had been trained in the same school , they began at once to formalize and conventionalize English poetry . The writers of the past , even the greatest writers of the past , were regarded as men of genius , but without art ; and English poetry was thenceforth , in Dryden 's own words , to start with Waller .</p>
    <p n="24">Under the newly adopted canons of French taste , narrative and didactic verse , or satire , took first place . Blank verse was tabooed as too prose-like ; so , too , were the enjambed rhymes . A succession of rhymed pentameter couplets , with the sense complete in each couplet , was set forth as the proper vehicle for poetry ; and this unenjambed distich fettered English verse for three-quarters of a century . In the drama the characters must be noble , the language dignified ; the metrical form must be the rhymed couplet , and the unities of time , place , and action must be observed .</p>
    <p n="25">Such , in brief , were the principles of French Classicism as applied to English poetry , principles of which Dryden was the first great exponent , and which Pope in the next generation carried to absolute perfection . Waller , Marvell , and Cowley all tried their pens in the new method , Cowley with least success ; and they were the poets in vogue when Dryden himself first attracted attention . Denham quite caught the favor of the critics with his mild conventionalities ; the Earl of Roscommon delighted them with his rhymed Essay on Translated Verse ; the brilliant court wits , Rochester , Dorset , and Sedley , who were writing for pleasure and not for publication , still clung to the frivolous lyric ; but the most - read and worst-treated poet of the Restoration was Butler . He published his Hudibras , a sharp satire on the extreme Puritans , in 1663 . Every one read the book , laughed uproariously , and left the author to starve in a garret . Of Dryden 's contemporaries in prose , there were Sir William Temple , later the patron of Swift , John Locke who contributed to philosophy his Essay Concerning the Human Understanding , the two diarists Evelyn and Pepys , and the critics Rymer and Langbaine ; there was Isaac Newton , who expounded in his Principia , 1687 , the laws of gravitation ; and there was the preaching tinker , who , confined in Bedford jail , gave to the world in 1678 one of its greatest allegories , Pilgrim 's Progress .</p>
    <p n="26">Dryden was nearly thirty before the production of the drama was resumed in England . Parliament had closed the theaters in 1642 , and that was an extinguisher of dramatic genius . Davenant had vainly tried to elude the law , and finally succeeded in evading it by setting his Siege of Rhodes to music , and producing the first English opera . At the Restoration , when the theaters were reopened , the dramas then produced reflected most vividly the looseness and immorality of the times . Their worst feature was that “ they possessed not wit enough to keep the mass of moral putrefaction sweet . ”</p>
    <p n="27">Davenant was prolific , Crowne wallowed in tragedy , Tate remodeled Shakspere ; so did Shadwell , who was later to measure swords with Dryden , and receive for his rashness an unmerciful castigation . But by all odds the strongest name in tragedy was Thomas Otway , who smacks of true Elizabethan genius in the Orphan and Venice Preserved . In comedy we receive the brilliant work of Etheridge , the vigor of Wycherley , and , as the century drew near its close , the dashing wit of Congreve , Vanbrugh , and Farquhar . This burst of brilliancy , in which the Restoration drama closes , was the prelude to the Augustan Age of Queen Anne and the first Georges , the period wherein flourished that group of self-satisfied , exceptionally clever , ultra-classical wits who added a peculiar zest and charm to our literature . As Dryden grew to old age , these younger men were already beginning to make themselves heard , though none had done great work . In poetry there were Prior , Gay , and Pope , while in prose we find names that stand high in the roll of fame ,— the story-teller Defoe , the bitter Swift , the rollicking Dick Steele , and delightful Addison .</p>
    <p n="28">This is the background in politics , society , and letters on which the life of Dryden was laid during the last half of the seventeenth century . There were conditions in his environment which materially modified his life and affected his literary form , and without a knowledge of these conditions no study of the man or his works can be effective or satisfactory . Dryden was preëminently a man of his times .</p>
    <p n="29">LIFE OF DRYDEN .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docTitle><titlePart>John Dryden was born at the vicarage of Aldwinkle , All Saints , in Northamptonshire , August 9 , 1631 . His father , Erasmus Dryden , was the third son of Sir Erasmus Dryden of Cannons Ashby . The estate descended to Dryden 's uncle , John , and is still in the family . His mother was Mary Pickering . Both the Drydens and Pickerings were Puritans , and were ranged on the side of Parliament in its struggle with Charles I . As a boy Dryden received his elementary education at Tichmarsh , and went thence to Westminster School , where he studied under the famous Dr. Busby . Here he first appeared in print with an elegiac poem on the death of a schoolfellow , Lord Hastings . It possesses the peculiarities of the extreme Marinists . The boy had died from smallpox , and Dryden writes :</titlePart></docTitle>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Each little pimple had a tear in it To wail the fault its rising did commit . ”</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>He entered Trinity College ,<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>, May 18 ,<date>1650</date>, took his B. A . in<date>1654</date>, and then , though he received no fellowship , lingered at the university for three years . Tradition tells us that he had no fondness for his Alma Mater , and certainly his verse contains compliments only for<settlement>Oxford</settlement>.</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>His father had died in 1654 and had bequeathed him a small estate . When , in 1657 , he finally left the university , he attached himself to his uncle , Sir Gilbert Pickering , a general of the Commonwealth . In 1658 he wrote Heroic Stanzas on Cromwell 's Death ; but shortly thereafter he went to London , threw himself into the life of literary Bohemia , and at the Restoration , in 1660 , wrote his Astroea Redux , as enthusiastically as the veriest royalist of them all . This sudden transformation of the eulogist of Cromwell to the panegyrist of Charles won for Dryden in some quarters the name of a political turncoat ; but such criticism was unjust . He was by birth and early training a Puritan ; add to this a poet 's admiration for a truly great character , and the lines on Cromwell are explained ; but during his London life he rubbed elbows with the world , early prejudices vanished , his true nature asserted itself , and it was John Dryden himself , not merely the son of his father , who celebrated Charles ’ return .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>On December 1 ,<date>1663</date>, he married Lady Elizabeth Howard , eldest daughter of the Earl of Berkshire , and the sister of a literary intimate . Tradition has pronounced the marriage an unhappy one , but facts do not bear out tradition . He nowhere referred other than affectionately to his wife , and always displayed a father 's warm affection for his sons , John , Charles , and Erasmus . Lady Elizabeth outlived her husband and eventually died insane . During the great plague in<settlement>London</settlement>,<date>1665</date>, Dryden fled with his wife to Charleton . He lived there for two years , and during that time wrote three productions that illustrate the three departments of literature to which he devoted himself : Annus Mirabilis , a narrative and descriptive poem on the fire of<date>1666</date>and the sea fight with the Dutch , the Essay on Dramatic Poesy , his first attempt at literary criticism in prose , and the Maiden Queen , a drama . In Annus Mirabilis we find the best work yet done by him . Marinist quaintness still clings here and there , and he has temporarily deserted the classical distich for a quatrain stanza ; but here , for the first time , we taste the Dryden of the Satires and the Fables . His Essay on Dramatic Poesy started modern prose . Hitherto English prose had suffered from long sentences , from involved sentences , and from clumsy Latinisms or too bald vernacular . Dryden happily united simplicity with grace , and gave us plain , straightforward sentences , musically arranged in well-ordered periods . This was the vehicle in which he introduced literary criticism , and he continued it in prefaces to most of his plays and subsequent poems . At this same time he not only discussed the drama , but indulged in its production ; and for a score of years from the early sixties he devoted himself almost exclusively to the stage . It was the most popular and the most profitable mode of expression . He began with a comedy , the Wild Gallant , in<date>1662</date>. It was a poor play and was incontinently condemned . He then developed a curious series of plays , of which the Indian Emperor , the Conquest of Grenada , and Aurengzebe are examples . He professedly followed French methods , observed the unities , and used the rhymed couplet . But they were not French ; they were a nondescript incubation by Dryden himself , and were called heroic dramas . They were ridiculed in the Duke of Buckingham 's farce , the Rehearsal ; but their popularity was scarcely impaired . In<date>1678</date>Dryden showed a return to common sense and to blank verse in All for Love , and , though it necessarily suffers from its comparison with the original , Shakspere 's Antony and Cleopatra , it nevertheless possesses enough dramatic power to make it his best play . He had preceded this by rewriting Milton 's Paradise Lost as an opera , in the State of Innocence , and he followed it in<date>1681</date>with perhaps his best comedy , the Spanish Friar . Dryden was now far the most prominent man of letters in<settlement>London</settlement>. In<date>1670</date>he had been appointed Poet Laureate and Historiographer Royal with a salary of two hundred pounds and a butt of sack . His connection with the stage had been a decided financial success , and he was in receipt of an income of about seven hundred pounds , which at modern values would approximate $ 15 , 000 . His house on Gerard Street , Soho , backed upon Leicester 's gardens . There he spent his days in writing , but the evening found him at Will 's Coffee House . In this famous resort of the wits and writers of the day the literary dictator of his generation held his court . Seated in his particular armchair , on the balcony in summer , by the fire in winter , he discoursed on topics current in the literary world , pronounced his verdict of praise or condemnation , and woe to the unfortunate upon whom the latter fell . A week before Christmas , in<date>1679</date>, as Dryden was walking home from an evening of this sort , he was waylaid by masked ruffians in Rose Alley and was beaten to unconsciousness . The attack was supposed to have been incited by Rochester , who smarted under an anonymous satire mistakenly attributed to Dryden . Though wrongly accused of this particular satire , it was not long before he did turn his attention to that department of verse . It was the time of the restless dissent of the Whigs from the succession of James ; and in<date>1681</date>Dryden launched Absalom and Achitophel , one of the most brilliant satires in our language , against Shaftesbury and his adherents , who were inciting Monmouth to revolt . He found an admirable parallel in Absalom 's revolt from his father David , and he sustained the comparison . The Scriptural names concealed living characters , and Shaftesbury masked as Achitophel , the evil counsellor , and Buckingham as Zimri . Feeling ran high . Shaftesbury was arrested and tried , but was acquitted , and his friends struck off a medal in commemoration . In<date>1682</date>, therefore , came Dryden 's second satire , the Medal . These two political satires called forth in the fevered state of the times a host of replies , two of the most scurrilous from the pens of Shadwell and Settle . Of these two poor Whigs the first was drawn and quartered in MacFlecnoe , while the two were yoked for castigation in Part II . of Absalom and Achitophel , which appeared in<date>1682</date>. Dryden possessed preëminently the faculty for satire . He did not devote himself exclusively to an abstract treatment , nor , like Pope , to bitter personalities ; he blends and combines the two methods most effectively . Every one of his brisk , nervous couplets carries a sting ; every distich is a sound box on the ear . We reach now a most interesting period in Dryden 's career and one that has provoked much controversy . In<date>1681</date>he published a long argument in verse , entitled Religio Laici ( the Religion of a Layman ) , in which he states his religious faith and his adherence to the Church of<country>England</country>. When King James came to the throne in<date>1685</date>he made an immediate attempt to establish the Roman Catholic faith ; and now Dryden , too , turned Romanist , and in<date>1687</date>supported his new faith in the long poetical allegory , the Hind and the Panther . Of course his enemies cried turncoat ; and it certainly looked like it . Dryden was well into manhood before the religious instinct stirred in him , and then , once waking , he naturally walked in the beaten track . But these instincts , though roused late , possessed the poet 's impetuosity ; and it was merely a natural intensifying of the same impulse that had brought him into the Church of<country>England</country>, which carried him to a more pronounced religious manifestation , and landed him in the Church of Rome . His sincerity is certainly backed by his acts , for when James had fled , and the staunch Protestants William and Mary held the throne , he absolutely refused to recant , and sacrificed his positions and emoluments . He was stripped of his royal offices and pensions , and , bitter humiliation , the laurel , torn from his brow , was placed on the head of that scorned jangler in verse , Shadwell . Deprived now of royal patronage and pensions , Dryden turned again to the stage , his old-time purse-filler ; and he produced two of his best plays , Don Sebastian and Amphitryon . The rest of his life , however , was to be spent , not with the drama , but in translation and paraphrase . Since<date>1684</date>he had several times published Miscellanies , collections of verse in which had appeared fragments of translations . With that indefatigable energy which characterized him , he now devoted himself to sustained effort . In<date>1693</date>he published a translation of Juvenal , and in the same year began his translation of Virgil , which was published in<date>1697</date>. The work was sold by subscription , and the poet was fairly well paid . Dryden 's translations are by no means exact ; but he caught the spirit of his poet , and carried something of it into his own effective verse .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Dryden was not great in original work , but he was particularly happy in adaptation ; and so it happened that his best play , All for Love , was modeled on Shakspere 's Antony and Cleopatra , and his best poem , Palamon and Arcite , was a paraphrase of the Knight 's Tale of Chaucer . Contrary to the general taste of his age , he had long felt and often expressed great admiration for the fourteenth-century poet . His work on Ovid had first turned his thought to Chaucer , he tells us , and by association he linked with him Boccaccio . As his life drew near its close he turned to those famous old story-tellers , and in the Fables gave us paraphrases in verse of eight of their most delightful tales , with translations from Homer and Ovid , a verse letter to his kinsman John Driden , his second St. Cedlia 's Ode , entitled Alexander 's Feast , and an Epitaph .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The Fables were published in<date>1700</date>. They were his last work . Friends of the poet , and they were legion , busied themselves at the beginning of that year in the arrangement of an elaborate benefit performance for him at the Duke 's Theater ; but Dryden did not live to enjoy the compliment . He suffered severely from gout ; a lack of proper treatment induced mortification , which spread rapidly , and in the early morning of the first of May ,<date>1700</date>, he died . He had been the literary figurehead of his generation , and the elaborate pomp of his funeral attested his great popularity . His body lay in state for several days and then with a great procession was borne , on the 13th of May , to the Poet 's Corner in Westminster Abbey . The last years of his life had been spent in fond study of the work of Chaucer , and so it happened that just three hundred years after the death of elder bard Dryden was laid to rest by the side of his great master .</docImprint>

  <body>
   <p>The Fables , in which this poem appears , were published in 1700 . The word fable as here used by Dryden holds its original meaning of story or tale . Besides the Palamon and Arcite , he paraphrased from Chaucer the Cock and the Fox , the Flower and the Leaf , the Wife of Bath 's Tale , the Character of the Good Parson . From Boccaccio he gave us Sigismonda and Guiscardo , Theodore and Honoria , and Cymon and Iphigenia , while he completed the volume with the first book of the Iliad , certain of Ovid 's Metamorphoses , the Epistle to John Driden , Alexander 's Feast , and an Epitaph . The Fables were dedicated to the Duke of Ormond , whose father and grandfather Dryden had previously honored in a prose epistle , full of the rather excessive compliment then in vogue . Palamon and Arcite is itself preceded by a dedication in verse to the Duchess of Ormond . In the graceful flattery of this inscription Dryden excelled himself , and he was easily grand master of the art in that age of superlative gallantry . The Duke acknowledged the compliment by a gift of five hundred pounds . The preface to the volume is one of Dryden 's best efforts in prose . It is mainly concerned with critical comment on Chaucer and Boccaccio ; and , though it lacks the accuracy of modern scholarship , it is full of a keen appreciation of his great forerunners .</p>
   <p>The work of Dryden in Palamon and Arcite may seem to us superfluous , for a well-educated man in the nineteenth century is familiar with his Chaucer in the original ; but in the sixteenth century our early poets were regarded as little better than barbarians , and their language was quite unintelligible . It was , therefore , a distinct addition to the literature of his age when he rescued from oblivion the Knight 's Tale , the first of the Canterbury Tales , and gave it to his world as Palamon and Arcite .</p>
   <p>Here , as in his translations , Dryden catches the spirit of his original and follows it ; but he does not track slavishly in its footprints . In this particular poem he follows his leader more closely than in some of his other paraphrases , and the three books in which he divides his Palamon and Arcite scarcely exceed in length the original Knight 's Tale . The tendency toward diffuse expansion , an excess of diluting epithets , which became a feature of eighteenth-century poetry , Dryden has sensibly shunned , and has stuck close to the brisk narrative and pithy descriptions of Chaucer . If the subject in hand be concrete description , as in the Temple of Mars , Dryden is at his best , and surpasses his original ; but if the abstract enters , as in the portraiture on the walls , he expands , and when he expands he weakens . To illustrate :</p>
   <p>“ The smiler with the knif under the cloke ”</p>
   <p>has lost force when Dryden stretches it into five verses :</p>
   <p>“ Next stood Hypocrisy , with holy leer ; Soft smiling , and demurely looking down , But hid the dagger underneath the gown : The assassinating wife , the household fiend , And far the blackest there , the traitor - friend . ”</p>
   <p>The anachronisms in the poem are Chaucer 's . When he put this story of Greek love and jealousy and strife into the mouth of his Knight , he was living in the golden age of chivalry ; and he simply transferred its setting to this chivalrous story of ancient Greece . The arms , the lists , the combat , the whole environment are those of the England of Edward III , not the Athens of Theseus . Dryden has left this unchanged , realizing the charm of its mediaeval simplicity . As Dryden gives it to us the poem is an example of narrative verse , brisk in its movement , dramatic in its action , and interspersed with descriptive passages that stimulate the imagination and satisfy the sense .</p>
   <p>Coming as it did in the last years of his life , the poem found him with his vocabulary fully developed and his versification perfected ; and these are points eminently essential in narrative verse . When Dryden began his literary career , he had but just left the university , and his speech smacked somewhat of the pedantry of the classical scholar of the times . Then came the Restoration with its worship of French phrase and its liberal importation . His easy-going life as a Bohemian in the early sixties strengthened his vernacular , and his association with the wits at Will 's Coffee House developed his literary English . A happy blending of all these elements , governed by his strong common sense , gave him at maturity a vocabulary not only of great scope , but of tremendous energy and vitality .</p>
   <p>At the time of the production of Palamon and Arcite Dryden had , by long practice , become an absolute master of the verse he used . As we have seen , his early work was impregnated with the peculiarities of the Marinists ; and even after the ascendency of French taste at the Restoration he still dallied with the stanza , and was not free from conceits . But his work in the heroic drama and in satire had determined his verse form and developed his ability in its use . In this poem , as in the bulk of his work , he employs the unenjambed pentameter distich ; that is , a couplet with five accented syllables in each verse and with the sense terminating with the couplet . Dryden 's mastery of this couplet was marvelous . He did not attain to the perfect polish of Pope a score of years later , but he possessed more vitality ; and to this strength must be added a fluent grace and a ready sequence which increased the beauty of the measure and gave to it a nervous energy of movement . The great danger that attends the use of the distich is monotony ; but Dryden avoided this . By a constant variation of cadence , he threw the natural pause now near the start , now near the close , and now in the midst of his verse , and in this way developed a rhythm that never wearies the ear with monotonous recurrence . He employed for this same purpose the hemistich or half-verse , the triplet or three consecutive verses with the same rhyme , and the Alexandrine with its six accents and its consequent well-rounded fullness .</p>
   <p>So much for Palamon and Arcite . First put into English by the best story-teller in our literature , it was retold at the close of the seventeenth century by the greatest poet of his generation , one of whose chief claims to greatness lies in his marvelous ability for adaptation and paraphrase .</p>
   <p>DRYDEN 'S PLACE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE .</p>
   <p>It remains to indicate briefly Dryden 's position in English literature . To the critics of his own time he was without question the greatest man of letters in his generation , and so he undeniably was after the death of Milton . We are not ready to say with Dr. Johnson that “ he found English of brick and left it of marble , ” for there was much marble before Dryden was dreamed of , and his own work is not entirely devoid of brick ; but that Dryden rendered to English services of inestimable value is not to be questioned . For forty years the great aim of his life was , as he tells us himself , to improve the English language and English poetry , and by constant and tireless effort in a mass of production of antipodal types he accomplished his object . He enriched and extended our vocabulary , he modulated our meters , he developed new forms , and he purified and invigorated style .</p>
   <p>There are a few poets in our literature who are better than Dryden ; there are a great many who are worse ; but there has been none who worked more constantly and more conscientiously for its improvement . Mr. Saintsbury has admirably summarized the situation : “ He is not our greatest poet ; far from it . But there is one point in which the superlative may safely be applied to him . Considering what he started with , what he accomplished , and what advantages he left to his successors , he must be pronounced , without exception , the greatest craftsman in English Letters . ”</p>

     <l n="1">In days of old there lived , of mighty fame ,</l>
     <l n="2">A valiant Prince , and Theseus was his name ;</l>
     <l n="3">A chief , who more in feats of arms excelled ,</l>
     <l n="4">The rising nor the setting sun beheld .</l>
     <l n="5">Of Athens he was lord ; much land he won ,</l>
     <l n="6">And added foreign countries to his crown .</l>
     <l n="7">In Scythia with the warrior Queen he strove ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whom first by force he conquered , then by love ;</l>
     <l n="9">He brought in triumph back the beauteous dame ,</l>
     <l n="10">With whom her sister , fair Emilia , came .</l>
     <l n="11">With honour to his home let Theseus ride ,</l>
     <l n="12">With Love to friend , and Fortune for his guide ,</l>
     <l n="13">And his victorious army at his side .</l>
     <l n="14">I pass their warlike pomp , their proud array ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their shouts , their songs , their welcome on the way ;</l>
     <l n="16">But , were it not too long , I would recite</l>
     <l n="17">The feats of Amazons , the fatal fight</l>
     <l n="18">Betwixt the hardy Queen and hero Knight ;</l>
     <l n="19">The town besieged , and how much blood it cost</l>
     <l n="20">The female army , and the Athenian host ;</l>
     <l n="21">The spousals of Hippolyta the Queen ;</l>
     <l n="22">What tilts and turneys at the feast were seen ;</l>
     <l n="23">The storm at their return , the ladies ’ fear :</l>
     <l n="24">But these and other things I must forbear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">The field is spacious I design to sow</l>
     <l n="26">With oxen far unfit to draw the plough :</l>
     <l n="27">The remnant of my tale is of a length</l>
     <l n="28">To tire your patience , and to waste my strength ;</l>
     <l n="29">And trivial accidents shall be forborn ,</l>
     <l n="30">That others may have time to take their turn ,</l>
     <l n="31">As was at first enjoined us by mine host ,</l>
     <l n="32">That he , whose tale is best and pleases most ,</l>
     <l n="33">Should win his supper at our common cost .</l>
     <l n="34">And therefore where I left , I will pursue</l>
     <l n="35">This ancient story , whether false or true ,</l>
     <l n="36">In hope it may be mended with a new .</l>
     <l n="37">The Prince I mentioned , full of high renown ,</l>
     <l n="38">In this array drew near the Athenian town ;</l>
     <l n="39">When , in his pomp and utmost of his pride</l>
     <l n="40">Marching , he chanced to cast his eye aside ,</l>
     <l n="41">And saw a quire of mourning dames , who lay</l>
     <l n="42">By two and two across the common way :</l>
     <l n="43">At his approach they raised a rueful cry ,</l>
     <l n="44">And beat their breasts , and held their hands on high ,</l>
     <l n="45">Creeping and crying , till they seized at last</l>
     <l n="46">His courser 's bridle and his feet embraced .</l>
     <l n="47">“ Tell me , ” said Theseus , “ what and whence you are ,</l>
     <l n="48">“ And why this funeral pageant you prepare ?</l>
     <l n="49">Is this the welcome of my worthy deeds ,</l>
     <l n="50">To meet my triumph in ill-omened weeds ?</l>
     <l n="51">Or envy you my praise , and would destroy</l>
     <l n="52">With grief my pleasures , and pollute my joy ?</l>
     <l n="53">Or are you injured , and demand relief ?</l>
     <l n="54">Name your request , and I will ease your grief . ”</l>
     <l n="55">The most in years of all the mourning train</l>
     <l n="56">Began ; but swounded first away for pain ;</l>
     <l n="57">Then scarce recovered spoke : “ Nor envy we</l>
     <l n="58">“ Thy great renown , nor grudge thy victory ;</l>
     <l n="59">‘ Tis thine , O King , the afflicted to redress ,</l>
     <l n="60">And fame has filled the world with thy success :</l>
     <l n="61">We wretched women sue for that alone ,</l>
     <l n="62">Which of thy goodness is refused to none ;</l>
     <l n="63">Let fall some drops of pity on our grief ,</l>
     <l n="64">If what we beg be just , and we deserve relief ;</l>
     <l n="65">For none of us , who now thy grace implore ,</l>
     <l n="66">But held the rank of sovereign queen before ;</l>
     <l n="67">Till , thanks to giddy Chance , which never bears</l>
     <l n="68">That mortal bliss should last for length of years ,</l>
     <l n="69">She cast us headlong from our high estate ,</l>
     <l n="70">And here in hope of thy return we wait ,</l>
     <l n="71">And long have waited in the temple nigh ,</l>
     <l n="72">Built to the gracious goddess Clemency .</l>
     <l n="73">But reverence thou the power whose name it bears ,</l>
     <l n="74">Relieve the oppressed , and wipe the widows ’ tears .</l>
     <l n="75">I , wretched I , have other fortune seen ,</l>
     <l n="76">The wife of Capaneus , and once a Queen ;</l>
     <l n="77">At Thebes he fell ; cursed be the fatal day !</l>
     <l n="78">And all the rest thou seest in this array</l>
     <l n="79">To make their moan their lords in battle lost ,</l>
     <l n="80">Before that town besieged by our confederate host .</l>
     <l n="81">But Creon , old and impious , who commands</l>
     <l n="82">The Theban city , and usurps the lands ,</l>
     <l n="83">Denies the rites of funeral fires to those</l>
     <l n="84">Whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes .</l>
     <l n="85">Unburned , unburied , on a heap they lie ;</l>
     <l n="86">Such is their fate , and such his tyranny ;</l>
     <l n="87">No friend has leave to bear away the dead ,</l>
     <l n="88">But with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed . ”</l>
     <l n="89">At this she shrieked aloud ; the mournful train</l>
     <l n="90">Echoed her grief , and grovelling on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="91">With groans , and hands upheld , to move his mind ,</l>
     <l n="92">Besought his pity to their helpless kind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="93">The Prince was touched , his tears began to flow ,</l>
     <l n="94">And , as his tender heart would break in two ,</l>
     <l n="95">He sighed ; and could not but their fate deplore ,</l>
     <l n="96">So wretched now , so fortunate before .</l>
     <l n="97">Then lightly from his lofty steed he flew ,</l>
     <l n="98">And raising one by one the suppliant crew ,</l>
     <l n="99">To comfort each , full solemnly he swore ,</l>
     <l n="100">That by the faith which knights to knighthood bore ,</l>
     <l n="101">And whate'er else to chivalry belongs ,</l>
     <l n="102">He would not cease , till he revenged their wrongs ;</l>
     <l n="103">That Greece should see performed what he declared ,</l>
     <l n="104">And cruel Creon find his just reward .</l>
     <l n="105">He said no more , but shunning all delay</l>
     <l n="106">Rode on , nor entered Athens on his way ;</l>
     <l n="107">But left his sister and his queen behind ,</l>
     <l n="108">And waved his royal banner in the wind ,</l>
     <l n="109">Where in an argent field the God of War</l>
     <l n="110">Was drawn triumphant on his iron car .</l>
     <l n="111">Red was his sword , and shield , and whole attire ,</l>
     <l n="112">And all the godhead seemed to glow with fire ;</l>
     <l n="113">Even the ground glittered where the standard flew ,</l>
     <l n="114">And the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue .</l>
     <l n="115">High on his pointed lance his pennon bore</l>
     <l n="116">His Cretan fight , the conquered Minotaur :</l>
     <l n="117">The soldiers shout around with generous rage ,</l>
     <l n="118">And in that victory their own presage .</l>
     <l n="119">He praised their ardour , inly pleased to see</l>
     <l n="120">His host , the flower of Grecian chivalry .</l>
     <l n="121">All day he marched , and all the ensuing night ,</l>
     <l n="122">And saw the city with returning light .</l>
     <l n="123">The process of the war I need not tell ,</l>
     <l n="124">How Theseus conquered , and how Creon fell ;</l>
     <l n="125">Or after , how by storm the walls were won ,</l>
     <l n="126">Or how the victor sacked and burned the town ;</l>
     <l n="127">How to the ladies he restored again</l>
     <l n="128">The bodies of their lords in battle slain ;</l>
     <l n="129">And with what ancient rites they were interred ;</l>
     <l n="130">All these to fitter time shall be deferred :</l>
     <l n="131">I spare the widows ’ tears , their woful cries ,</l>
     <l n="132">And howling at their husbands ’ obsequies ;</l>
     <l n="133">How Theseus at these funerals did assist ,</l>
     <l n="134">And with what gifts the mourning dames dismissed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="135">Thus when the victor chief had Creon slain ,</l>
     <l n="136">And conquered Thebes , he pitched upon the plain</l>
     <l n="137">His mighty camp , and when the day returned ,</l>
     <l n="138">The country wasted and the hamlets burned ,</l>
     <l n="139">And left the pillagers , to rapine bred ,</l>
     <l n="140">Without control to strip and spoil the dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="141">There , in a heap of slain , among the rest</l>
     <l n="142">Two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppressed</l>
     <l n="143">Of slaughtered foes , whom first to death they sent ,</l>
     <l n="144">The trophies of their strength , a bloody monument .</l>
     <l n="145">Both fair , and both of royal blood they seemed ,</l>
     <l n="146">Whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deemed ;</l>
     <l n="147">That day in equal arms they fought for fame ;</l>
     <l n="148">Their swords , their shields , their surcoats were the same :</l>
     <l n="149">Close by each other laid they pressed the ground ,</l>
     <l n="150">Their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound ;</l>
     <l n="151">Nor well alive nor wholly dead they were ,</l>
     <l n="152">But some faint signs of feeble life appear ;</l>
     <l n="153">The wandering breath was on the wing to part ,</l>
     <l n="154">Weak was the pulse , and hardly heaved the heart .</l>
     <l n="155">These two were sisters ’ sons ; and Arcite one ,</l>
     <l n="156">Much famed in fields , with valiant Palamon .</l>
     <l n="157">From these their costly arms the spoilers rent ,</l>
     <l n="158">And softly both conveyed to Theseus ’ tent :</l>
     <l n="159">Whom , known of Creon 's line and cured with care ,</l>
     <l n="160">He to his city sent as prisoners of the war ;</l>
     <l n="161">Hopeless of ransom , and condemned to lie</l>
     <l n="162">In durance , doomed a lingering death to die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="163">This done , he marched away with warlike sound ,</l>
     <l n="164">And to his Athens turned with laurels crowned ,</l>
     <l n="165">Where happy long he lived , much loved , and more renowned .</l>
     <l n="166">But in a tower , and never to be loosed ,</l>
     <l n="167">The woful captive kinsmen are enclosed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="168">Thus year by year they pass , and day by day ,</l>
     <l n="169">Till once ( ‘ twas on the morn of cheerful May )</l>
     <l n="170">The young Emilia , fairer to be seen</l>
     <l n="171">Than the fair lily on the flowery green ,</l>
     <l n="172">More fresh than May herself in blossoms new ,</l>
     <l n="173">( For with the rosy colour strove her hue ,)</l>
     <l n="174">Waked , as her custom was , before the day ,</l>
     <l n="175">To do the observance due to sprightly May ;</l>
     <l n="176">For sprightly May commands our youth to keep</l>
     <l n="177">The vigils of her night , and breaks their sluggard sleep ;</l>
     <l n="178">Each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves ;</l>
     <l n="179">Inspires new flames , revives extinguished loves .</l>
     <l n="180">In this remembrance Emily ere day</l>
     <l n="181">Arose , and dressed herself in rich array ;</l>

     <l n="183">Adown her shoulders fell her length of hair :</l>
     <l n="184">A ribband did the braided tresses bind ,</l>
     <l n="185">The rest was loose , and wantoned in the wind :</l>
     <l n="186">Aurora had but newly chased the night ,</l>
     <l n="187">And purpled o'er the sky with blushing light ,</l>
     <l n="188">When to the garden-walk she took her way ,</l>
     <l n="189">To sport and trip along in cool of day ,</l>
     <l n="190">And offer maiden vows in honour of the May . 190</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="191">At every turn she made a little stand ,</l>

     <l n="194">She shook the stalk , and brushed away the dew ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="195">Then party-coloured flowers of white and red</l>
     <l n="196">She wove , to make a garland for her head :</l>

     <l n="198">That men and angels might rejoice to hear ;</l>
     <l n="199">Even wondering Philomel forgot to sing ,</l>
     <l n="200">And learned from her to welcome in the spring .</l>
     <l n="201">The tower , of which before was mention made ,</l>
     <l n="202">Within whose keep the captive knights were laid ,</l>
     <l n="203">Built of a large extent , and strong withal ,</l>
     <l n="204">Was one partition of the palace wall ;</l>
     <l n="205">The garden was enclosed within the square ,</l>

     <l n="207">It happened Palamon , the prisoner knight ,</l>
     <l n="208">Restless for woe , arose before the light ,</l>
     <l n="209">And with his jailor 's leave desired to breathe</l>
     <l n="210">An air more wholesome than the damps beneath .</l>
     <l n="211">This granted , to the tower he took his way ,</l>
     <l n="212">Cheered with the promise of a glorious day ;</l>
     <l n="213">Then cast a languishing regard around ,</l>
     <l n="214">And saw with hateful eyes the temples crowned</l>
     <l n="215">With golden spires , and all the hostile ground .</l>
     <l n="216">He sighed , and turned his eyes , because he knew</l>
     <l n="217">‘ Twas but a larger jail he had in view ;</l>
     <l n="218">Then looked below , and from the castle 's height</l>

     <l n="225">Himself an object of the public scorn ,</l>
     <l n="226">And often wished he never had been born .</l>
     <l n="227">At last ( for so his destiny required ) ,</l>
     <l n="228">With walking giddy , and with thinking tired ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="229">He through a little window cast his sight ,</l>

     <l n="237">Young Arcite heard ; and up he ran with haste ,</l>
     <l n="238">To help his friend , and in his arms embraced ;</l>

     <l n="240">And whence , and how , his change of cheer began ?</l>
     <l n="241">Or who had done the offence ? “ But if , ” said he ,</l>

     <l n="256">And perish with insensible decay :</l>
     <l n="257">A glance of some new goddess gave the wound ,</l>
     <l n="258">Whom , like Actaeon , unaware I found .</l>

     <l n="561">By chance he spied a mirror while he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="562">And gazing there beheld his altered look ;</l>
     <l n="563">Wondering , he saw his features and his hue</l>
     <l n="564">So much were changed , that scarce himself he knew .</l>
     <l n="565">A sudden thought then starting in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="566">“ Since I in Arcite cannot Arcite find ,</l>
     <l n="567">The world may search in vain with all their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="568">But never penetrate through this disguise .</l>
     <l n="569">Thanks to the change which grief and sickness give ,</l>
     <l n="570">In low estate I may securely live ,</l>
     <l n="571">And see , unknown , my mistress day by day . ”</l>
     <l n="572">He said , and clothed himself in coarse array ,</l>
     <l n="573">A labouring hind in show ; then forth he went ,</l>
     <l n="574">And to the Athenian towers his journey bent :</l>
     <l n="575">One squire attended in the same disguise ,</l>
     <l n="576">Made conscious of his master 's enterprise .</l>
     <l n="577">Arrived at Athens , soon he came to court ,</l>
     <l n="578">Unknown , unquestioned in that thick resort :</l>
     <l n="579">Proffering for hire his service at the gate ,</l>
     <l n="580">To drudge , draw water , and to run or wait .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="581">So fair befel him , that for little gain</l>
     <l n="582">He served at first Emilia 's chamberlain ;</l>
     <l n="583">And , watchful all advantages to spy ,</l>
     <l n="584">Was still at hand , and in his master 's eye ;</l>
     <l n="585">And as his bones were big , and sinews strong ,</l>
     <l n="586">Refused no toil that could to slaves belong ;</l>
     <l n="587">But from deep wells with engines water drew ,</l>
     <l n="588">And used his noble hands the wood to hew .</l>
     <l n="589">He passed a year at least attending thus</l>
     <l n="590">On Emily , and called Philostratus .</l>
     <l n="591">But never was there man of his degree</l>
     <l n="592">So much esteemed , so well beloved as he .</l>
     <l n="593">So gentle of condition was he known ,</l>
     <l n="594">That through the court his courtesy was blown :</l>
     <l n="595">All think him worthy of a greater place ,</l>
     <l n="596">And recommend him to the royal grace ;</l>
     <l n="597">That exercised within a higher sphere ,</l>
     <l n="598">His virtues more conspicuous might appear .</l>
     <l n="599">Thus by the general voice was Arcite praised ,</l>
     <l n="600">And by great Theseus to high favour raised ;</l>
     <l n="601">Among his menial servants first enrolled ,</l>
     <l n="602">And largely entertained with sums of gold :</l>
     <l n="603">Besides what secretly from Thebes was sent ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="604">Of his own income and his annual rent .</l>
     <l n="605">This well employed , he purchased friends and fame ,</l>
     <l n="606">But cautiously concealed from whence it came .</l>
     <l n="607">Thus for three years he lived with large increase</l>
     <l n="608">In arms of honour , and esteem in peace ;</l>
     <l n="609">To Theseus ’ person he was ever near ,</l>
     <l n="610">And Theseus for his virtues held him dear .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">While Arcite lives in bliss , the story turns</l>
     <l n="2">Where hopeless Palamon in prison mourns .</l>
     <l n="3">For six long years immured , the captive knight</l>
     <l n="4">Had dragged his chains , and scarcely seen the light :</l>
     <l n="5">Lost liberty and love at once he bore ;</l>
     <l n="6">His prison pained him much , his passion more :</l>
     <l n="7">Nor dares he hope his fetters to remove ,</l>
     <l n="8">Nor ever wishes to be free from love .</l>
     <l n="9">But when the sixth revolving year was run ,</l>
     <l n="10">And May within the Twins received the sun ,</l>
     <l n="11">Were it by Chance , or forceful Destiny ,</l>
     <l n="12">Which forms in causes first whate'er shall be ,</l>
     <l n="13">Assisted by a friend one moonless night ,</l>
     <l n="14">This Palamon from prison took his flight :</l>
     <l n="15">A pleasant beverage he prepared before</l>
     <l n="16">Of wine and honey mixed , with added store</l>
     <l n="17">Of opium ; to his keeper this he brought ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who swallowed unaware the sleepy draught ,</l>
     <l n="19">And snored secure till morn , his senses bound</l>
     <l n="20">In slumber , and in long oblivion drowned .</l>
     <l n="21">Short was the night , and careful Palamon</l>
     <l n="22">Sought the next covert ere the rising sun .</l>
     <l n="23">A thick-spread forest near the city lay ,</l>
     <l n="24">To this with lengthened strides he took his way ,</l>
     <l n="25">( For far he could not fly , and feared the day . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="26">Safe from pursuit , he meant to shun the light ,</l>
     <l n="27">Till the brown shadows of the friendly night</l>
     <l n="28">To Thebes might favour his intended flight .</l>
     <l n="29">When to his country come , his next design</l>
     <l n="30">Was all the Theban race in arms to join ,</l>
     <l n="31">And war on Theseus , till he lost his life ,</l>
     <l n="32">Or won the beauteous Emily to wife .</l>
     <l n="33">Thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile ,</l>
     <l n="34">To gentle Arcite let us turn our style ;</l>
     <l n="35">Who little dreamt how nigh he was to care ,</l>
     <l n="36">Till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare .</l>
     <l n="37">The morning-lark , the messenger of day ,</l>
     <l n="38">Saluted in her song the morning gray ;</l>
     <l n="39">And soon the sun arose with beams so bright ,</l>
     <l n="40">That all the horizon laughed to see the joyous sight ;</l>
     <l n="41">He with his tepid rays the rose renews ,</l>
     <l n="42">And licks the dropping leaves , and dries the dews ;</l>
     <l n="43">When Arcite left his bed , resolved to pay</l>
     <l n="44">Observance to the month of merry May ,</l>
     <l n="45">Forth on his fiery steed betimes he rode ,</l>
     <l n="46">That scarcely prints the turf on which he trod :</l>
     <l n="47">At ease he seemed , and prancing o'er the plains ,</l>
     <l n="48">Turned only to the grove his horse 's reins ,</l>
     <l n="49">The grove I named before , and , lighting there ,</l>
     <l n="50">A woodbind garland sought to crown his hair ;</l>
     <l n="51">Then turned his face against the rising day ,</l>
     <l n="52">And raised his voice to welcome in the May :</l>
     <l n="53">“ For thee , sweet month , the groves green liveries wear ,</l>
     <l n="54">If not the first , the fairest of the year :</l>
     <l n="55">For thee the Graces lead the dancing hours ,</l>
     <l n="56">And Nature 's ready pencil paints the flowers :</l>
     <l n="57">When thy short reign is past , the feverish sun</l>
     <l n="58">The sultry tropic fears , and moves more slowly on .</l>
     <l n="59">So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight ,</l>
     <l n="60">Nor goats with venomed teeth thy tendrils bite ,</l>
     <l n="61">As thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find</l>
     <l n="62">The fragrant greens I seek , my brows to bind . ”</l>
     <l n="63">His vows addressed , within the grove he strayed ,</l>
     <l n="64">Till Fate or Fortune near the place conveyed</l>
     <l n="65">His steps where secret Palamon was laid .</l>
     <l n="66">Full little thought of him the gentle knight ,</l>
     <l n="67">Who flying death had there concealed his flight ,</l>
     <l n="68">In brakes and brambles hid , and shunning mortal sight ;</l>
     <l n="69">And less he knew him for his hated foe ,</l>
     <l n="70">But feared him as a man he did not know .</l>
     <l n="71">But as it has been said of ancient years ,</l>
     <l n="72">That fields are full of eyes and woods have ears ,</l>
     <l n="73">For this the wise are ever on their guard ,</l>
     <l n="74">For unforeseen , they say , is unprepared .</l>
     <l n="75">Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone ,</l>
     <l n="76">And less than all suspected Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="77">Who , listening , heard him , while he searched the grove ,</l>
     <l n="78">And loudly sung his roundelay of love :</l>
     <l n="79">But on the sudden stopped , and silent stood ,</l>
     <l n="80">( As lovers often muse , and change their mood ;)</l>
     <l n="81">Now high as heaven , and then as low as hell ,</l>
     <l n="82">Now up , now down , as buckets in a well :</l>
     <l n="83">For Venus , like her day , will change her cheer ,</l>
     <l n="84">And seldom shall we see a Friday clear .</l>
     <l n="85">Thus Arcite , having sung , with altered hue</l>
     <l n="86">Sunk on the ground , and from his bosom drew</l>
     <l n="87">A desperate sigh , accusing Heaven and Fate ,</l>
     <l n="88">And angry Juno 's unrelenting hate :</l>
     <l n="89">“ Cursed be the day when first I did appear ;</l>
     <l n="90">Let it be blotted from the calendar ,</l>
     <l n="91">Lest it pollute the month , and poison all the year .</l>
     <l n="92">Still will the jealous Queen pursue our race ?</l>
     <l n="93">Cadmus is dead , the Theban city was :</l>
     <l n="94">Yet ceases not her hate ; for all who come</l>
     <l n="95">From Cadmus are involved in Cadmus ’ doom .</l>
     <l n="96">I suffer for my blood : unjust decree ,</l>
     <l n="97">That punishes another 's crime on me .</l>
     <l n="98">In mean estate I serve my mortal foe ,</l>
     <l n="99">The man who caused my country 's overthrow .</l>
     <l n="100">This is not all ; for Juno , to my shame ,</l>
     <l n="101">Has forced me to forsake my former name ;</l>
     <l n="102">Arcite I was , Philostratus I am .</l>
     <l n="103">That side of heaven is all my enemy :</l>
     <l n="104">Mars ruined Thebes ; his mother ruined me .</l>
     <l n="105">Of all the royal race remains but one</l>
     <l n="106">Besides myself , the unhappy Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="107">Whom Theseus holds in bonds and will not free ;</l>
     <l n="108">Without a crime , except his kin to me .</l>
     <l n="109">Yet these and all the rest I could endure ;</l>
     <l n="110">But love 's a malady without a cure :</l>
     <l n="111">Fierce Love has pierced me with his fiery dart ,</l>
     <l n="112">He fires within , and hisses at my heart .</l>
     <l n="113">Your eyes , fair Emily , my fate pursue ;</l>
     <l n="114">I suffer for the rest , I die for you .</l>
     <l n="115">Of such a goddess no time leaves record ,</l>
     <l n="116">Who burned the temple where she was adored :</l>
     <l n="117">And let it burn , I never will complain ,</l>
     <l n="118">Pleased with my sufferings , if you knew my pain . ”</l>
     <l n="119">At this a sickly qualm his heart assailed ,</l>
     <l n="120">His ears ring inward , and his senses failed .</l>
     <l n="121">No word missed Palamon of all he spoke ;</l>
     <l n="122">But soon to deadly pale he changed his look :</l>
     <l n="123">He trembled every limb , and felt a smart ,</l>
     <l n="124">As if cold steel had glided through his heart ;</l>
     <l n="125">Nor longer stayed , but starting from his place ,</l>
     <l n="126">Discovered stood , and showed his hostile face :</l>
     <l n="127">“ False traitor , Arcite , traitor to thy blood ,</l>
     <l n="128">Bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good ,</l>
     <l n="129">Now art thou found forsworn for Emily ,</l>
     <l n="130">And darest attempt her love , for whom I die .</l>
     <l n="131">So hast thou cheated Theseus with a wile ,</l>
     <l n="132">Against thy vow , returning to beguile</l>
     <l n="133">Under a borrowed name : as false to me ,</l>
     <l n="134">So false thou art to him who set thee free .</l>
     <l n="135">But rest assured , that either thou shalt die ,</l>
     <l n="136">Or else renounce thy claim in Emily ;</l>
     <l n="137">For , though unarmed I am , and freed by chance ,</l>
     <l n="138">Am here without my sword or pointed lance ,</l>
     <l n="139">Hope not , base man , unquestioned hence to go ,</l>
     <l n="140">For I am Palamon , thy mortal foe . ”</l>
     <l n="141">Arcite , who heard his tale and knew the man ,</l>
     <l n="142">His sword unsheathed , and fiercely thus began :</l>
     <l n="143">“ Now , by the gods who govern heaven above ,</l>

     <l n="145">That word had been thy last ; or in this grove</l>
     <l n="146">This hand should force thee to renounce thy love ;</l>

     <l n="153">Our arms shall plead the titles of our love :</l>
     <l n="154">And Heaven so help my right , as I alone</l>
     <l n="155">Will come , and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown ,</l>
     <l n="156">With arms of proof both for myself and thee ;</l>
     <l n="157">Choose thou the best , and leave the worst to me .</l>
     <l n="158">And , that at better ease thou mayest abide ,</l>
     <l n="159">Bedding and clothes I will this night provide ,</l>
     <l n="160">And needful sustenance , that thou mayest be</l>

     <l n="162">His promise Palamon accepts ; but prayed ,</l>
     <l n="163">To keep it better than the first he made .</l>
     <l n="164">Thus fair they parted till the morrow 's dawn ;</l>
     <l n="165">For each had laid his plighted faith to pawn ;</l>
     <l n="166">Oh Love ! thou sternly dost thy power maintain ,</l>

     <l n="171">Arcite returned , and , as in honour tied ,</l>
     <l n="172">His foe with bedding and with food supplied ;</l>
     <l n="173">Then , ere the day , two suits of armour sought ,</l>

     <l n="207">With grunts and groans the forest rings around .</l>
     <l n="208">So fought the knights , and fighting must abide ,</l>

     <l n="216">And some one day , some wondrous chance appears ,</l>
     <l n="217">Which happened not in centuries of years :</l>
     <l n="218">For sure , whate'er we mortals hate or love</l>
     <l n="219">Or hope or fear depends on powers above :</l>
     <l n="220">They move our appetites to good or ill ,</l>
     <l n="221">And by foresight necessitate the will .</l>
     <l n="222">In Theseus this appears , whose youthful joy</l>
     <l n="223">Was beasts of chase in forests to destroy ;</l>
     <l n="224">This gentle knight , inspired by jolly May ,</l>
     <l n="225">Forsook his easy couch at early day ,</l>
     <l n="226">And to the wood and wilds pursued his way .</l>
     <l n="227">Beside him rode Hippolita the queen ,</l>
     <l n="228">And Emily attired in lively green ,</l>
     <l n="229">With horns and hounds and all the tuneful cry ,</l>
     <l n="230">To hunt a royal hart within the covert nigh :</l>
     <l n="231">And , as he followed Mars before , so now</l>
     <l n="232">He serves the goddess of the silver bow .</l>
     <l n="233">The way that Theseus took was to the wood ,</l>
     <l n="234">Where the two knights in cruel battle stood :</l>
     <l n="235">The laund on which they fought , the appointed place</l>
     <l n="236">In which the uncoupled hounds began the chase .</l>
     <l n="237">Thither forth-right he rode to rouse the prey ,</l>
     <l n="238">That shaded by the fern in harbour lay ;</l>
     <l n="239">And thence dislodged , was wont to leave the wood</l>
     <l n="240">For open fields , and cross the crystal flood .</l>
     <l n="241">Approached , and looking underneath the sun ,</l>
     <l n="242">He saw proud Arcite and fierce Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="243">In mortal battle doubling blow on blow ;</l>
     <l n="244">Like lightning flamed their fauchions to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="245">And shot a dreadful gleam ; so strong they strook ,</l>
     <l n="246">There seemed less force required to fell an oak .</l>
     <l n="247">He gazed with wonder on their equal might ,</l>
     <l n="248">Looked eager on , but knew not either knight .</l>
     <l n="249">Resolved to learn , he spurred his fiery steed</l>
     <l n="250">With goring rowels to provoke his speed .</l>
     <l n="251">The minute ended that began the race ,</l>
     <l n="252">So soon he was betwixt them on the place ;</l>
     <l n="253">And with his sword unsheathed , on pain of life</l>
     <l n="254">Commands both combatants to cease their strife ;</l>
     <l n="255">Then with imperious tone pursues his threat :</l>
     <l n="256">“ What are you ? why in arms together met ?</l>
     <l n="257">How dares your pride presume against my laws ,</l>
     <l n="258">As in a listed field to fight your cause ,</l>
     <l n="259">Unasked the royal grant ; no marshal by ,</l>
     <l n="260">As knightly rites require , nor judge to try ? ”</l>
     <l n="261">Then Palamon , with scarce recovered breath ,</l>
     <l n="262">Thus hasty spoke : “ We both deserve the death ,</l>
     <l n="263">And both would die ; for look the world around ,</l>
     <l n="264">And pity soonest runs in gentle minds ;</l>
     <l n="265">Then reasons with himself ; and first he finds</l>
     <l n="266">His passion cast a mist before his sense ,</l>
     <l n="267">And either made or magnified the offence .</l>
     <l n="268">Offence ? Of what ? To whom ? Who judged the cause ?</l>
     <l n="269">The prisoner freed himself by Nature 's laws ;</l>
     <l n="270">Born free , he sought his right ; the man he freed</l>
     <l n="271">Was perjured , but his love excused the deed :</l>
     <l n="272">Thus pondering , he looked under with his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="273">And saw the women 's tears , and heard their cries ,</l>
     <l n="274">Which moved compassion more ; he shook his head ,</l>
     <l n="275">And softly sighing to himself he said :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="276">Curse on the unpardoning prince , whom tears can draw</l>
     <l n="277">“ To no remorse , who rules by lion 's law ;</l>
     <l n="278">And deaf to prayers , by no submission bowed ,</l>
     <l n="279">Rends all alike , the penitent and proud ! ”</l>
     <l n="280">At this with look serene he raised his head ;</l>
     <l n="281">Reason resumed her place , and passion fled :</l>
     <l n="282">Then thus aloud he spoke :— ” The power of Love ,</l>
     <l n="283">“ In earth , and seas , and air , and heaven above ,</l>
     <l n="284">Rules , unresisted , with an awful nod ,</l>
     <l n="285">By daily miracles declared a god ;</l>
     <l n="286">He blinds the wise , gives eye-sight to the blind ;</l>
     <l n="287">And moulds and stamps anew the lover 's mind .</l>
     <l n="288">Behold that Arcite , and this Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="289">Freed from my fetters , and in safety gone ,</l>
     <l n="290">What hindered either in their native soil</l>
     <l n="291">At ease to reap the harvest of their toil ?</l>
     <l n="292">But Love , their lord , did otherwise ordain ,</l>
     <l n="293">And brought them , in their own despite again ,</l>
     <l n="294">To suffer death deserved ; for well they know</l>
     <l n="295">‘ Tis in my power , and I their deadly foe .</l>
     <l n="296">The proverb holds , that to be wise and love ,</l>
     <l n="297">Is hardly granted to the gods above .</l>
     <l n="298">See how the madmen bleed ! behold the gains</l>
     <l n="299">With which their master , Love , rewards their pains !</l>
     <l n="300">For seven long years , on duty every day ,</l>
     <l n="301">Lo ! their obedience , and their monarch 's pay !</l>
     <l n="302">Yet , as in duty bound , they serve him on ;</l>
     <l n="303">And ask the fools , they think it wisely done ;</l>
     <l n="304">Nor ease nor wealth nor life it self regard ,</l>
     <l n="305">For ‘ tis their maxim , love is love 's reward .</l>
     <l n="306">This is not all ; the fair , for whom they strove ,</l>
     <l n="307">Nor knew before , nor could suspect their love ,</l>
     <l n="308">Nor thought , when she beheld the fight from far ,</l>
     <l n="309">Her beauty was the occasion of the war .</l>
     <l n="310">But sure a general doom on man is past ,</l>
     <l n="311">And all are fools and lovers , first or last :</l>
     <l n="312">This both by others and my self I know ,</l>
     <l n="313">For I have served their sovereign long ago ;</l>
     <l n="314">Oft have been caught within the winding train</l>
     <l n="315">Of female snares , and felt the lover 's pain ,</l>
     <l n="316">And learned how far the god can human hearts constrain .</l>
     <l n="317">To this remembrance , and the prayers of those</l>
     <l n="318">Who for the offending warriors interpose ,</l>
     <l n="319">I give their forfeit lives , on this accord ,</l>
     <l n="320">To do me homage as their sovereign lord ;</l>
     <l n="321">And as my vassals , to their utmost might ,</l>
     <l n="322">Assist my person and assert my right . ”</l>
     <l n="323">This freely sworn , the knights their grace obtained ;</l>
     <l n="324">Then thus the King his secret thought explained :</l>
     <l n="325">“ If wealth or honour or a royal race ,</l>
     <l n="326">Or each or all , may win a lady 's grace ,</l>
     <l n="327">Then either of you knights may well deserve</l>

     <l n="329">For Emily is sister to the crown ,</l>
     <l n="330">And but too well to both her beauty known :</l>
     <l n="331">But should you combat till you both were dead ,</l>
     <l n="332">Two lovers cannot share a single bed</l>
     <l n="333">As , therefore , both are equal in degree ,</l>

     <l n="338">Search the wide world , and where you please repair ;</l>
     <l n="339">But on the day when this returning sun</l>
     <l n="340">To the same point through every sign has run ,</l>
     <l n="341">Then each of you his hundred knights shall bring</l>
     <l n="342">In royal lists , to fight before the king ;</l>
     <l n="343">And then the knight , whom Fate or happy Chance</l>
     <l n="344">Shall with his friends to victory advance ,</l>
     <l n="345">And grace his arms so far in equal fight ,</l>
     <l n="346">From out the bars to force his opposite ,</l>
     <l n="347">Or kill , or make him recreant on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="348">The prize of valour and of love shall gain ;</l>
     <l n="349">The vanquished party shall their claim release ,</l>
     <l n="350">And the long jars conclude in lasting peace .</l>
     <l n="351">The charge be mine to adorn the chosen ground ,</l>
     <l n="352">The theatre of war , for champions so renowned ;</l>
     <l n="353">And take the patron 's place of either knight ,</l>
     <l n="354">With eyes impartial to behold the fight ;</l>
     <l n="355">And Heaven of me so judge as I shall judge aright .</l>
     <l n="356">If both are satisfied with this accord ,</l>
     <l n="357">Swear by the laws of knighthood on my sword . ”</l>

     <l n="575">The graceful goddess was arrayed in green ;</l>

     <l n="1">The day approached when Fortune should decide</l>
     <l n="2">The important enterprise , and give the bride ;</l>
     <l n="3">For now the rivals round the world had sought ,</l>
     <l n="4">And each his number , well appointed , brought .</l>
     <l n="5">The nations far and near contend in choice ,</l>
     <l n="6">And send the flower of war by public voice ;</l>
     <l n="7">That after or before were never known</l>
     <l n="8">Such chiefs , as each an army seemed alone :</l>
     <l n="9">Beside the champions , all of high degree ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who knighthood loved , and deeds of chivalry ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thronged to the lists , and envied to behold</l>
     <l n="12">The names of others , not their own , enrolled .</l>
     <l n="13">Nor seems it strange ; for every noble knight</l>
     <l n="14">Who loves the fair , and is endued with might ,</l>
     <l n="15">In such a quarrel would be proud to fight .</l>
     <l n="16">There breathes not scarce a man on British ground</l>
     <l n="17">( An isle for love and arms of old renowned )</l>
     <l n="18">But would have sold his life to purchase fame ,</l>
     <l n="19">To Palamon or Arcite sent his name ;</l>
     <l n="20">And had the land selected of the best ,</l>
     <l n="21">Half had come hence , and let the world provide the rest .</l>
     <l n="22">A hundred knights with Palamon there came ,</l>
     <l n="23">Approved in fight , and men of mighty name ;</l>
     <l n="24">Their arms were several , as their nations were ,</l>
     <l n="25">But furnished all alike with sword and spear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="26">Some wore coat armour , imitating scale ,</l>
     <l n="27">And next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail ;</l>
     <l n="28">Some wore a breastplate and a light juppon ,</l>
     <l n="29">Their horses clothed with rich caparison ;</l>
     <l n="30">Some for defence would leathern bucklers use</l>
     <l n="31">Of folded hides , and others shields of Pruce .</l>
     <l n="32">One hung a pole-axe at his saddle-bow ,</l>
     <l n="33">And one a heavy mace to stun the foe ;</l>
     <l n="34">One for his legs and knees provided well ,</l>
     <l n="35">With jambeux armed , and double plates of steel ;</l>
     <l n="36">This on his helmet wore a lady 's glove ,</l>
     <l n="37">And that a sleeve embroidered by his love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="38">With Palamon above the rest in place ,</l>
     <l n="39">Lycurgus came , the surly king of Thrace ;</l>
     <l n="40">Black was his beard , and manly was his face</l>
     <l n="41">The balls of his broad eyes rolled in his head ,</l>
     <l n="42">And glared betwixt a yellow and a red ;</l>
     <l n="43">He looked a lion with a gloomy stare ,</l>
     <l n="44">And o'er his eyebrows hung his matted hair ;</l>
     <l n="45">Big-boned and large of limbs , with sinews strong ,</l>
     <l n="46">Broad-shouldered , and his arms were round and long .</l>
     <l n="47">Four milk-white bulls ( the Thracian use of old )</l>
     <l n="48">Were yoked to draw his car of burnished gold .</l>
     <l n="49">Upright he stood , and bore aloft his shield ,</l>
     <l n="50">Conspicuous from afar , and overlooked the field .</l>
     <l n="51">His surcoat was a bear-skin on his back ;</l>
     <l n="52">His hair hung long behind , and glossy raven-black .</l>
     <l n="53">His ample forehead bore a coronet ,</l>
     <l n="54">With sparkling diamonds and with rubies set .</l>
     <l n="55">Ten brace , and more , of greyhounds , snowy fair ,</l>
     <l n="56">And tall as stags , ran loose , and coursed around his chair ,</l>
     <l n="57">A match for pards in flight , in grappling for the bear ;</l>
     <l n="58">With golden muzzles all their mouths were bound ,</l>
     <l n="59">And collars of the same their necks surround .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="60">Thus through the fields Lycurgus took his way ;</l>
     <l n="61">His hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="62">To match this monarch , with strong Arcite came</l>
     <l n="63">Emetrius , king of Inde , a mighty name ,</l>
     <l n="64">On a bay courser , goodly to behold ,</l>
     <l n="65">The trappings of his horse embossed with barbarous gold .</l>
     <l n="66">Not Mars bestrode a steed with greater grace ;</l>
     <l n="67">His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace ,</l>
     <l n="68">Adorned with pearls , all orient , round , and great ;</l>
     <l n="69">His saddle was of gold , with emeralds set ;</l>
     <l n="70">His shoulders large a mantle did attire ,</l>
     <l n="71">With rubies thick , and sparkling as the fire ;</l>
     <l n="72">His amber-coloured locks in ringlets run ,</l>
     <l n="73">With graceful negligence , and shone against the sun .</l>
     <l n="74">His nose was aquiline , his eyes were blue ,</l>
     <l n="75">Ruddy his lips , and fresh and fair his hue ;</l>
     <l n="76">Some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skin .</l>
     <l n="78">His awful presence did the crowd surprise ,</l>
     <l n="79">Nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="80">Eyes that confessed him born for kingly sway ,</l>
     <l n="81">So fierce , they flashed intolerable day .</l>
     <l n="82">His age in nature 's youthful prime appeared ,</l>
     <l n="83">And just began to bloom his yellow beard .</l>
     <l n="84">Whene'er he spoke , his voice was heard around ,</l>
     <l n="85">Loud as a trumpet , with a silver sound ;</l>
     <l n="86">A laurel wreathed his temples , fresh , and green ,</l>
     <l n="87">And myrtle sprigs , the marks of love , were mixed between .</l>
     <l n="88">Upon his fist he bore , for his delight ,</l>
     <l n="89">An eagle well reclaimed , and lily white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="90">His hundred knights attend him to the war ,</l>
     <l n="91">All armed for battle ; save their heads were bare .</l>
     <l n="92">Words and devices blazed on every shield ,</l>
     <l n="93">And pleasing was the terror of the field .</l>
     <l n="94">For kings , and dukes , and barons you might see ,</l>
     <l n="95">Like sparkling stars , though different in degree ,</l>
     <l n="96">All for the increase of arms , and love of chivalry .</l>
     <l n="97">Before the king tame leopards led the way ,</l>
     <l n="98">And troops of lions innocently play .</l>
     <l n="99">So Bacchus through the conquered Indies rode ,</l>

     <l n="101">In this array the war of either side</l>

     <l n="107">Himself with open arms the kings embraced ,</l>
     <l n="108">Then all the rest in their degrees were graced .</l>
     <l n="109">No harbinger was needful for the night ,</l>

     <l n="127">There , falling on his knees before her shrine ,</l>
