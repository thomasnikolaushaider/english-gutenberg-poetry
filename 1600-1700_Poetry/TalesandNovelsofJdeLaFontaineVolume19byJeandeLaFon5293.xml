    <head>THE PSALTER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">ONCE more permit me , nuns , and this the last ;</l>
     <l n="2">I can n't resist , whatever may have passed ,</l>
     <l n="3">But must relate , what often I 've been told ;</l>
     <l n="4">Your tales of convent pranks are seldom cold ;</l>
     <l n="5">They have a grace that no where else we find ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , somehow , better seem to please designed .</l>
     <l n="7">Another then we 'll have , which three will make :—</l>
     <l n="8">Three did I say ? -  ‘ tis four , or I mistake ;</l>
     <l n="9">Let 's count them well : - The GARD'NER first , we 'll name ;</l>
     <l n="10">Then comes the ABBESS , whose declining frame</l>
     <l n="11">Required a youth , her malady to cure</l>
     <l n="12">A story thought , perhaps , not over pure ;</l>
     <l n="13">And , as to SISTER JANE , who 'd got a brat ,</l>
     <l n="14">I cannot fancy we should alter that .</l>
     <l n="15">These are the whole , and four 's a number round ;</l>
     <l n="16">You 'll probably remark , ‘ tis strange I 've found</l>
     <l n="17">Such pleasure in detailing convent scenes :—</l>
     <l n="18">‘ Tis not my whim , but TASTE , that thither leans :</l>
     <l n="19">And , if you 'd kept your breviary in view ,</l>
     <l n="20">‘ Tis clear , you 'd nothing had with this to do ;</l>
     <l n="21">We know , howe'er , ‘ tis not your fondest care ;</l>
     <l n="22">So , quickly to our hist'ry let 's repair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">A CHARMING youth would frequent visits pay ,</l>
     <l n="24">To nuns , whose convent near his dwelling lay ;</l>
     <l n="25">And , ‘ mong the sisters , one his person saw ,</l>
     <l n="26">Who , by her eyes , would fain attention draw ;</l>
     <l n="27">Smiles she bestowed , and other complaisance ,</l>
     <l n="28">But not a single step would he advance ;</l>
     <l n="29">By old and young he greatly was admired ;</l>
     <l n="30">Sighs burst around , but none his bosom fired .</l>
     <l n="31">Fair Isabella solely got his love ,</l>
     <l n="32">A beauteous nun , and gentle as a dove ,</l>
     <l n="33">Till then a novice in the flow'ry chain ,</l>
     <l n="34">And envied doubly :— for her charms and swain .</l>
     <l n="35">Their soft amours were watched with eagle-eye :</l>
     <l n="36">No pleasure 's free from care you may rely ;</l>
     <l n="37">In life each comfort coupled is with ill ,</l>
     <l n="38">And this to alter baffles all our skill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">THE sister nuns so vigilant had been ,</l>
     <l n="40">One night when darkness overspread the scene ;</l>
     <l n="41">And all was proper mysteries to hide ,</l>
     <l n="42">Some words escaped her cell that doubts supplied ,</l>
     <l n="43">And other matters too were heard around ,</l>
     <l n="44">That in her breviary could not be found .</l>
     <l n="45">‘ Tis her gallant ! said they : he 's clearly caught ;</l>
     <l n="46">Alarm pervaded ; swarms were quickly brought ;</l>
     <l n="47">Rage seemed to triumph ; sentinels were placed ;</l>
     <l n="48">The abbess too must know they were disgraced .</l>
     <l n="49">Away they hastened to convey surprise ,</l>
     <l n="50">And , thund'ring at her door , cried , madam rise ,</l>
     <l n="51">For sister Isabella , in her cell ,</l>
     <l n="52">Has got a man , which surely can n't be well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="53">YOU will observe , the dame was not at prayer ,</l>
     <l n="54">Nor yet absorbed in sleep , devoid of care ,</l>
     <l n="55">But with her then , this abbess had in bed</l>
     <l n="56">Good parson John , by kindness thither led ,</l>
     <l n="57">A neighb'ring rector , confessor , and friend ;</l>
     <l n="58">She rose in haste the sisters to attend ,</l>
     <l n="59">And , seeking for her veil , with sense confused ,</l>
     <l n="60">The parson 's breeches took for what she used ,</l>
     <l n="61">Which , in the dark , resembled what was worn</l>
     <l n="62">By nuns for veils , and called ( perhaps in scorn ) ,</l>
     <l n="63">Among themselves , their PSALTER , to express</l>
     <l n="64">Familiarly , a common , awkward dress .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="65">WITH this new ornament , by way of veil ,</l>
     <l n="66">She sallied forth and heard the woeful tale .</l>
     <l n="67">Then , irritated , she exclaimed with ire</l>
     <l n="68">To see this wretched creature I desire ,</l>
     <l n="69">The devil 's daughter , from her bold career ,</l>
     <l n="70">Who 'll bring our convent to disgrace , I fear ;</l>
     <l n="71">But God forbid , I say , and with his leave ,</l>
     <l n="72">We 'll all restore :— rebuke she shall receive .</l>
     <l n="73">A chapter we will call :— the sisters came ,</l>
     <l n="74">And stood around to hear their pious dame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="75">FAIR Isabella now the abbess sent ,</l>
     <l n="76">Who straight obeyed , and to her tears gave vent ,</l>
     <l n="77">Which overspread those lily cheeks and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="78">A roguish youth so lately held his prize .</l>
     <l n="79">What ! said the abbess : pretty scandal here ,</l>
     <l n="80">When in the house of God such things appear ;</l>
     <l n="81">Ashamed to death you ought to be , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="82">Who brought you thither ?— such we always scout .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="83">NOW Isabella , (— sister you must lose ,</l>
     <l n="84">Henceforth , that name to you we cannot use ;</l>
     <l n="85">The honour is too great ,) in such a case ,</l>
     <l n="86">Pray are you sensible of your disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="87">And what 's the punishment you 'll undergo ?</l>
     <l n="88">Before to-morrow , this you 'll fully know ;</l>
     <l n="89">Our institution chastisement decrees ;</l>
     <l n="90">Come speak , I say , we 'll hear you if you please .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="91">POOR Isabella , with her sight on ground ,</l>
     <l n="92">Confused , till then had scarcely looked around ,</l>
     <l n="93">Now raised her eyes , and luckily perceived</l>
     <l n="94">The breeches , which her fears in part relieved ,</l>
     <l n="95">And that the sisters , by surprise unnerved ,</l>
     <l n="96">As oft 's the case , had never once observed .</l>
     <l n="97">She courage took , and to the abbess said ,</l>
     <l n="98">There 's something from the Psalter , on your head ,</l>
     <l n="99">That awkwardly hangs down ; pray , madam , try</l>
     <l n="100">To put it right , or ‘ twill be in your eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="101">‘ TWAS knee-strings , worn , at times , by priests and beaux ,</l>
     <l n="102">For , more or less , all follow fashion 's laws .</l>
     <l n="103">This veil , no doubt , had very much the air</l>
     <l n="104">Of those unmentionables parsons wear ;</l>
     <l n="105">And this the nun , to frolicking inclined ,</l>
     <l n="106">It seems had well impressed upon her mind .</l>
     <l n="107">What , cried the abbess , dares she still to sneer ?</l>
     <l n="108">How great her insolence to laugh and jeer ,</l>
     <l n="109">When sins so heavily upon her rest ,</l>
     <l n="110">And ev'ry thing remains quite unconfessed .</l>
     <l n="111">Upon my word , she 'd be a saint decreed ;</l>
     <l n="112">My veil , young imp , your notice cannot need ;</l>
     <l n="113">‘ Tis better think , you little hellish crow ,</l>
     <l n="114">What pains your soul must undergo below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="115">THE mother abbess sermonized and fired ,</l>
     <l n="116">And seemed as if her tongue would ne'er be tired .</l>
     <l n="117">Again the culprit said , your Psalter , pray ,</l>
     <l n="118">Good madam , haste to set the proper way ;</l>
     <l n="119">On which the sisters looked , both young and old</l>
     <l n="120">THOSE ‘ gan to laugh , while THESE were heard to scold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="121">OUR preacher , quite ashamed of what she 'd done ,</l>
     <l n="122">Now lost her voice , and noticed not the nun ;</l>
     <l n="123">The murmur buzzed around , too well expressed ,</l>
     <l n="124">What thoughts the holy sisterhood possessed .</l>
     <l n="125">At length the abbess said :— we 've now not time</l>
     <l n="126">To take the chapter 's votes upon her crime ;</l>
     <l n="127">‘ Twould make it late ; let each to bed return ,</l>
     <l n="128">And , till to-morrow , we 'll the case adjourn .</l>
     <l n="129">No chapter met , howe'er , when morrow came ;</l>
     <l n="130">Another day arrived , and still the same ;</l>
     <l n="131">The sages of the convent thought it best ,</l>
     <l n="132">In fact , to let the mystick business rest .</l>
     <l n="133">Much noise , perhaps , would hurt religion 's cause ,</l>
     <l n="134">And , that considered , prudent ‘ twere to pause .</l>
     <l n="135">Base envy made them Isabella hate ,</l>
     <l n="136">And dark suspicions to the abbess state .</l>
     <l n="137">In short , unable by their schemes to get</l>
     <l n="138">The morsel she 'd so fortunately met ,</l>
     <l n="139">Each nun exerted all her art to find ,</l>
     <l n="140">What equally might satisfy the mind .</l>
     <l n="141">Old friends were willingly received again ;</l>
     <l n="142">Her gallant our belle was suffered to retain ;</l>
     <l n="143">The rector and the abbess had their will ;</l>
     <l n="144">And , such their union , precepts to fulfill ,</l>
     <l n="145">That if a nun had none to give her bliss ,</l>
     <l n="146">To lend a friend was nothing thought amiss .</l>

    <head>KING CANDAULES AND THE DOCTOR OF LAWS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IN life oft ills from self-imprudence spring ;</l>
     <l n="2">As proof , Candaules ’ story we will bring ;</l>
     <l n="3">In folly 's scenes the king was truly great :</l>
     <l n="4">His vassal , Gyges , had from him a bait ,</l>
     <l n="5">The like in gallantry was rarely known ,</l>
     <l n="6">And want of prudence never more was shown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">MY friend , said he , you frequently have seen</l>
     <l n="8">The beauteous face and features of the queen ;</l>
     <l n="9">But these are naught , believe me , to the rest ,</l>
     <l n="10">Which solely can be viewed when quite undressed .</l>
     <l n="11">Some day I 'll let you gratify your eyes ;</l>
     <l n="12">Without her knowledge I 'll means devise ;</l>
     <l n="13">But on condition :— you 'll remember well</l>
     <l n="14">What you behold , to no one you will tell ,</l>
     <l n="15">In ev'ry step most cautiously proceed ,</l>
     <l n="16">And not your mind with silly wishes feed ;</l>
     <l n="17">No sort of pleasure surely I could take ,</l>
     <l n="18">To see vain passion you her lover make .</l>
     <l n="19">You must propose , this charming form to view ,</l>
     <l n="20">As if mere marble , though to nature true ;</l>
     <l n="21">And I 'm convinced you 'll readily declare ,</l>
     <l n="22">Beyond nor art can reach , nor thought prepare ;</l>
     <l n="23">Just now I left her in the bath at ease :</l>
     <l n="24">A judge you are , and shall the moment seize ;</l>
     <l n="25">Come , witness my felicity supreme ;</l>
     <l n="26">You know her beauties are my constant theme .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">AWAY they went , and Gyges much admired ;</l>
     <l n="28">Still more than that : in truth his breast was fired ;</l>
     <l n="29">For when she moved astonishment was great ,</l>
     <l n="30">And ev'ry grace upon her seemed to wait .</l>
     <l n="31">Emotion to suppress howe'er he tried ,</l>
     <l n="32">Since he had promised what he felt to hide ;</l>
     <l n="33">To hold his tongue he wished , but that might raise</l>
     <l n="34">Suspicions of designs and mystick ways .</l>
     <l n="35">Exaggeration was the better part ,</l>
     <l n="36">And from the subject he would never start ,</l>
     <l n="37">But fully praised each beauty in detail ,</l>
     <l n="38">Without appearing any thing to veil .</l>
     <l n="39">Gods ! Gyges cried , how truly , king , you 're blessed ;</l>
     <l n="40">The skin how fair — how charming all the rest !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="41">THIS am'rous conversation by the queen</l>
     <l n="42">Was never heard , or she 'd enraged have been ;</l>
     <l n="43">In ancient days of ignorance , we find ,</l>
     <l n="44">The sex , to show resentment , much inclined ;</l>
     <l n="45">In diff'rent light at present this appears ,</l>
     <l n="46">And fulsome praises ne'er offend their ears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">OUR arch observer struggled with his sighs</l>
     <l n="48">Those feelings much increased , so fair the prize :</l>
     <l n="49">The prince , in doubt , conducted him away ;</l>
     <l n="50">But in his heart a hundred arrows lay ;</l>
     <l n="51">Each magick charm directed pointed darts ;</l>
     <l n="52">To flee were useless : LOVE such pain imparts ,</l>
     <l n="53">That nothing can at times obstruct its course ;</l>
     <l n="54">So quick the flight : so truly great the force .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="55">WHILE near the king , much caution Gyges showed ;</l>
     <l n="56">But soon the belle perceived his bosom glowed ;</l>
     <l n="57">She learned the cause :— her spouse the tale disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="58">And laughed and jeered , as he the facts exposed :</l>
     <l n="59">A silly blockhead ! not to know a queen</l>
     <l n="60">Could raillery not bear on such a scene .</l>
     <l n="61">But had it pleased her wishes , still ‘ twere right</l>
     <l n="62">( Such honour 's dictates ) to discover spite ;</l>
     <l n="63">And this she truly did , while in her mind ,</l>
     <l n="64">To be revenged she fully was inclined .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="65">FOR once , good reader , I should wish thee wife ;</l>
     <l n="66">Or otherwise , thou never can'st in life ,</l>
     <l n="67">Conceive the lengths a woman oft will go ,</l>
     <l n="68">Whose breast is filled with wrath and secret woe .</l>
     <l n="69">A mortal was allowed these charms to view ,</l>
     <l n="70">Which others ’ eyes could never dare pursue .</l>
     <l n="71">Such treasures were for gods , or rather kings</l>
     <l n="72">The privilege of both are beauteous things .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="73">THESE thoughts induced the queen revenge to seek ;</l>
     <l n="74">Rage moved her breast , and shame possessed her cheek .</l>
     <l n="75">E'en Cupid , we are told , assistance gave ;</l>
     <l n="76">What from his aim effectually can save ?</l>
     <l n="77">Fair in person was Gyges to behold ;</l>
     <l n="78">Excuses for her easy ‘ twere to mould ;</l>
     <l n="79">To show her charms , what baseness could excel ?</l>
     <l n="80">And on th ’ exposer all her hatred fell .</l>
     <l n="81">Besides , he was a husband , which is worse</l>
     <l n="82">With these each sin receives a double curse .</l>
     <l n="83">What more shall I detail ?— the facts are plain :</l>
     <l n="84">Detested was the king :— beloved the swain ;</l>
     <l n="85">All was accomplished , and the monarch placed</l>
     <l n="86">Among the heroes who with horns are graced ;</l>
     <l n="87">No doubt a dignity not much desired ,</l>
     <l n="88">Though in repute , and easily acquired .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="89">SUCH merit had the prince 's folly got ,</l>
     <l n="90">‘ In petto ’ , Vulcan 's brother was his lot ;</l>
     <l n="91">The distance thence is little to the HAT :</l>
     <l n="92">The honour much the same of this or that .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="93">SO far ‘ twas passing well , but , in the intrigue ;</l>
     <l n="94">The cruel Parcae now appeared to league ;</l>
     <l n="95">And soon the lovers , on possession bent ,</l>
     <l n="96">To black Cocytus ’ shores the monarch sent ;</l>
     <l n="97">Too much of certain potions forced to drink ,</l>
     <l n="98">He quickly viewed the dreary , horrid brink ;</l>
     <l n="99">While pleasing the objects Gyges ’ eyes beheld ;</l>

     <l n="114">Where better tastes have into fashion got ,</l>
     <l n="115">And pleasure solely occupies the mind</l>
     <l n="116">To rapture ev'ry bosom seems resigned .</l>
     <l n="117">A tempting journey truly it appears ,</l>

     <l n="119">NOT long ago , then , in the city dwelled ,</l>
     <l n="120">A master , who in teaching law excelled ;</l>
     <l n="121">In other matters he , howe'er , was thought</l>
     <l n="122">A man that jollity and laughter sought .</l>

     <l n="125">IT happened that our learned doctor had ,</l>
     <l n="126">Among his many pupils ( good and bad )</l>
     <l n="127">A Frenchman , less designed to study laws ,</l>
     <l n="128">Than , in amours , perhaps , to gain applause .</l>
     <l n="129">One day , observing him with clouded mien ,</l>
     <l n="130">My friend , said he , you surely have the spleen ,</l>
     <l n="131">And , out of college , nothing seem to do ;</l>
     <l n="132">No law books read :— some object I 'd pursue ;</l>
     <l n="133">A handsome Frenchman should his hours improve ;</l>

     <l n="137">THE , student answered , I am new at Rome ,</l>

     <l n="139">I can n't perceive , gallants much business find ,</l>
     <l n="140">Each house , like monasteries , is designed ,</l>
     <l n="141">With double doors , and bolts , and matrons sour ,</l>
     <l n="142">And husbands Argus-eyed , who 'd you devour .</l>
     <l n="143">Where can I go to follow up your plan ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="147">HA ! HA ! replied the doctor with delight ,</l>
     <l n="148">The honour which you do us is not slight ;</l>
     <l n="149">I pity men quite fresh and raw like you ;</l>
     <l n="150">Our town , I see , you 've hardly travelled through ,</l>
     <l n="151">You fancy then , such wily snares are set ,</l>

     <l n="153">I 'd have you know , we 've creatures who devise ,</l>

     <l n="155">‘ Tis very common ; only try around ,</l>
     <l n="156">And soon you 'll find , that sly amours abound .</l>
     <l n="157">Within the neighb'ring church go take your place ,</l>
     <l n="158">And , to the dames who pass in search of grace ,</l>
     <l n="159">Present your fingers dipt in water blessed :—</l>
     <l n="160">A sign for those who wish to be caressed .</l>
     <l n="161">In case the suppliant 's air some lady please ,</l>
     <l n="162">Who knows her trade , and how to act at ease ,</l>
     <l n="163">She 'll send a message , something to desire :</l>
     <l n="164">You 'll soon be found , wherever you retire ,</l>
     <l n="165">Though lodged so secretly , that God alone ,</l>
     <l n="166">Till then , your place of residence had known .</l>
     <l n="167">An aged female will on you attend ,</l>
     <l n="168">Who , used to this , will full assistance lend ,</l>
     <l n="169">Arrange an interview with wily art ;</l>
     <l n="170">No trouble take , you 'll have an easy part ;</l>
     <l n="171">No trouble did I say ? why , that 's too much ;</l>
     <l n="172">Some things I would except , their pow'r is such ;</l>
     <l n="173">And proper ‘ tis , my friend , that I should hint ,</l>
     <l n="174">Attentions you at Rome should well imprint ,</l>
     <l n="175">And be discrete ; in France you favours boast :</l>
     <l n="176">Of ev'ry moment here you make the most ;</l>
     <l n="177">The Romans to the greatest lengths proceed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="178">So best , the spark replied , I like the deed ;</l>

     <l n="180">Superior prowess always I display .</l>
     <l n="181">Perhaps ‘ twas otherwise , for ev'ry wight ;</l>
     <l n="182">In this , to play the Gascon , thinks it right .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="183">To all the doctor 's words our youth adhered ,</l>
     <l n="184">And presently within a church appeared ,</l>
     <l n="185">Where daily came the choicest belles around ,</l>
     <l n="186">And loves and graces in their train were found ,</l>
     <l n="187">Or , if ‘ tis wished in modern phrase to speak ,</l>
     <l n="188">Attention num'rous angels there would seek .</l>
     <l n="189">Beneath their veils were beauteous sparkling eyes ;</l>

     <l n="191">IN lucky spot the spark his station took ,</l>

     <l n="195">One angel ‘ mong the rest the boon received ,</l>
     <l n="196">With easy pleasing air , that much relieved ;</l>
     <l n="197">On which the student to himself expressed ,</l>

     <l n="199">WHEN home , an aged female to him came ,</l>

     <l n="201">To count particulars howe'er were vain</l>
     <l n="202">Their pranks were many , and their folly plain ;</l>
     <l n="203">The belle was handsome ; ev'ry bliss was sought ,</l>
     <l n="204">And all their moments most delightful thought .</l>

     <l n="205">HE , to the doctor , ev'ry matter told</l>
     <l n="206">Discretion in a Frenchman would be cold ;</l>

     <l n="208">Smells strong of shop , and would not fashion fit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="209">THE learned teacher satisfaction showed ,</l>
     <l n="210">That such success from his instructions flowed ,</l>
     <l n="211">Laughed heartily at husbands , silly wights ,</l>
     <l n="212">Who had not wit to guard connubial rights ,</l>
     <l n="213">And from their lamb the wily wolf to keep :</l>
     <l n="214">A shepherd will o'erlook a hundred sheep ,</l>
     <l n="215">While foolish man 's unable to protect ,</l>
     <l n="216">E'en one where most he 'd wish to be correct .</l>
     <l n="217">Howe'er , this care he thought was somewhat hard ,</l>
     <l n="218">But not a thing impossible to guard ;</l>
     <l n="219">And if he had not got a hundred eyes ,</l>
     <l n="220">Thank heav'n , his wife , though cunning to devise ,</l>
     <l n="221">He could defy :— her thoughts so well he knew ,</l>
     <l n="222">That these intrigues she never would pursue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="223">YOU 'LL , ne'er believe , good reader , without shame ,</l>
     <l n="224">The doctor 's wife was she our annals name ;</l>
     <l n="225">And what 's still worse , so many things he asked ,</l>
     <l n="226">Her look , air , form , and secret charms unmasked ,</l>
     <l n="227">That ev'ry answer fully seemed to say ,</l>
     <l n="228">‘ Twas clearly she , who thus had gone astray .</l>
     <l n="229">One circumstance the lawyer led to doubt :</l>
     <l n="230">Some talents had the student pointed out ,</l>
     <l n="231">Which she had never to her husband shown ,</l>
     <l n="232">And this relief administered alone .</l>
     <l n="233">Thought he , those manners not to her belong ,</l>
     <l n="234">But all the rest are indications strong ,</l>
     <l n="235">And prove the case ; yet she at home is dull ;</l>
     <l n="236">While this appears to be a prattling trull ,</l>
     <l n="237">And pleasing in her conversation too ;</l>
     <l n="238">In other matters ‘ tis my wife we view ,</l>
     <l n="239">Form , face , complexion , features , eyes , and hair ,</l>
     <l n="240">The whole combined pronounces her the fair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="241">AT length , when to himself the sage had said</l>
     <l n="242">‘ Tis she ; and then , ‘ tis not ;— his senses led</l>
     <l n="243">To make him in the first opinion rest ,</l>
     <l n="244">You well may guess what rage was in his breast .</l>
     <l n="245">A second meeting you have fixed ? cried he ;</l>
     <l n="246">Yes , said the Frenchman , that was made with glee ;</l>
     <l n="247">We found the first so pleasing to our mind ,</l>
     <l n="248">That to another both were well inclined ,</l>
     <l n="249">And thoroughly resolved more fun to seek .</l>
     <l n="250">That 's right , replied the doctor , have your freak ;</l>
     <l n="251">The lady howsoe'er I now could name .</l>
     <l n="252">The scholar answered , that to me 's the same ;</l>
     <l n="253">I care not what she 's called , Nor who she be :</l>
     <l n="254">‘ Tis quite enough that we so well agree .</l>
     <l n="255">By this time I 'm convinced her loving spouse .</l>
     <l n="256">Possesses what an anchorite might rouse ;</l>
     <l n="257">And if a failure any where be met ,</l>
     <l n="258">At such a place to-morrow one may get ,</l>
     <l n="259">What I shall hope , exactly at the hour ,</l>
     <l n="260">To find resigned and fully in my pow'r :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="261">IN bed I shall be instantly received ,</l>
     <l n="262">And from anxiety be soon relieved .</l>
     <l n="263">The place of meeting is a room below ,</l>
     <l n="264">Most nicely furnished , rich , but void of show .</l>
     <l n="265">At first I through a passage dark was led ,</l>
     <l n="266">Where Sol 's bright rays are ne'er allowed to spread ;</l>
     <l n="267">But soon , by my conductress , I was brought ,</l>
     <l n="268">‘ Mid LOVE 'S delights , where all with charms was frought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="269">ON this you may suppose the doctor 's pain ;</l>
     <l n="270">But presently he thought a point to gain ,</l>
     <l n="271">And take the student 's place by wily art ,</l>
     <l n="272">Where , acting in disguise the lover 's part ,</l>
     <l n="273">His rib he might entangle in a net ,</l>
     <l n="274">And vassalage bestow she 'd ne'er forget .</l>
     <l n="275">Our learned man was clearly in the wrong ;</l>
     <l n="276">‘ Twere better far to sleep and hold his tongue ;</l>
     <l n="277">Unless , with God 's assistance , he could raise</l>
     <l n="278">A remedy that merited full praise .</l>
     <l n="279">Whenever wives have got a candidate ,</l>
     <l n="280">To be admitted to the Cuckold 's state ,</l>
     <l n="281">If thence he get scot free ‘ tis luck indeed ;</l>
     <l n="282">But once received , and ornaments decreed ,</l>
     <l n="283">A blot the more will surely nothing add ,</l>
     <l n="284">To one already in the garment clad .</l>
     <l n="285">The doctor otherwise however thought ;</l>
     <l n="286">Yet still his reason no advantage brought ;</l>
     <l n="287">Indeed he fancied , if he could forestall</l>
     <l n="288">The youth who now he might his master call ;</l>
     <l n="289">The trick would to his wisdom credit do ,</l>
     <l n="290">And show , superior wiles he could pursue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="291">AWAY the husband hastened to the place ;</l>
     <l n="292">In full belief , that , hiding well his face ,</l>
     <l n="293">And favoured by the darkness of the spot ,</l>
     <l n="294">The silence marked , and myst'ry of the plot ,</l>
     <l n="295">He , undiscovered , safely might be led ,</l>
     <l n="296">Where such delicious fruits were ready spread .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="297">MISFORTUNE , howsoe'er , would so direct</l>
     <l n="298">The aged female nothing to neglect ,</l>
     <l n="299">Had with her got a lantern to conduct ,</l>
     <l n="300">The light from which at will she could obstruct ,</l>
     <l n="301">And , far more cunning than our learned sage ,</l>
     <l n="302">Perceived at once with whom she had t'engage ;</l>
     <l n="303">But , marking no surprise , she bade him wait ,</l>
     <l n="304">While she , his coming , to her dame should state .</l>
     <l n="305">Said she , unless I tell her first you 're here ,</l>
     <l n="306">I dare not let you in her room appear .</l>
     <l n="307">Besides , you have not got the right attire ;</l>

     <l n="309">My lady , you must know , is gone to bed :—</l>
     <l n="310">Then , thrusting in a dressing room his head ,</l>

     <l n="312">Of night-cap , slippers , shirt , and combs for hair ,</l>
     <l n="313">With perfumes too , in Rome the nicest known ,</l>
     <l n="314">And fit for highest cardinals to own .</l>
     <l n="315">His clothes the learned doctor laid aside ;</l>
     <l n="316">The aged female came his steps to guide ;</l>
     <l n="317">Through passages she led him by the hand ,</l>
     <l n="318">Where all was dark , and many turnings planned ;</l>
     <l n="319">At once bewildered , and deprived of sight ,</l>
     <l n="320">The lawyer tottered much for want of light .</l>
     <l n="321">At length she ope 'd a door , and pushed the sage ,</l>
     <l n="322">Where most unpleasantly he must engage ,</l>
     <l n="323">Though doubtless ev'ry way his proper place :—</l>
     <l n="324">The school where he was used the LAWS to trace !</l>
     <l n="325">O'ercome with shame , confusion , and surprise ,</l>
     <l n="326">He nearly fainted , vain ‘ twere to disguise .</l>
