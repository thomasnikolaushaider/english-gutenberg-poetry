    <head>THE PROGRESS OF WIT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">DIVERTING in extreme there is a play ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which oft resumes its fascinating sway ;</l>
     <l n="3">Delights the sex , or ugly , fair , or sour ;</l>
     <l n="4">By night or day :— ‘ tis sweet at any hour .</l>
     <l n="5">The frolick , ev'ry where is known to fame ;</l>
     <l n="6">Conjecture if you can , and tells its name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">THIS play 's chief charm to husbands is unknown ;</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis with the lover it excels alone ;</l>
     <l n="9">No lookers-on , as umpires , are required ;</l>
     <l n="10">No quarrels rise , though each appears inspired ;</l>
     <l n="11">All seem delighted with the pleasing game :—</l>
     <l n="12">Conjecture if you can , and tell its name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">BE this as ‘ twill , and called whate'er it may ;</l>
     <l n="14">No longer trifling with it I shall stay ,</l>
     <l n="15">But now disclose a method to transmit</l>
     <l n="16">( As oft we find ) to ninnies sense and wit .</l>
     <l n="17">Till Alice got instruction in this school ,</l>
     <l n="18">She was regarded as a silly fool ,</l>
     <l n="19">Her exercise appeared to spin and sew :—</l>
     <l n="20">Not hers indeed , the hands alone would go ;</l>
     <l n="21">For sense or wit had in it no concern ;</l>
     <l n="22">Whate'er the foolish girl had got to learn ,</l>
     <l n="23">No part therein could ever take the mind ;</l>
     <l n="24">Her doll , for thought , was just as well designed .</l>
     <l n="25">The mother would , a hundred times a day ,</l>
     <l n="26">Abuse the stupid maid , and to her say</l>
     <l n="27">Go wretched lump and try some wit to gain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">THE girl , quite overcome with shame and pain ;</l>
     <l n="29">Her neighbours asked to point her out the spot ,</l>
     <l n="30">Where useful wit by purchase might be got .</l>
     <l n="31">The simple question laughter raised around ;</l>
     <l n="32">At length they told her , that it might be found</l>
     <l n="33">With father Bonadventure , who 'd a stock ,</l>
     <l n="34">Which he at times disposed of to his flock .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">AWAY in haste she to the cloister went ,</l>
     <l n="36">To see the friar she was quite intent ,</l>
     <l n="37">Though trembling lest she might disturb his ease ;</l>
     <l n="38">And one of his high character displease .</l>
     <l n="39">The girl exclaimed , as on she moved ,— Will he</l>
     <l n="40">Such presents willingly bestow on me ,</l>
     <l n="41">Whose age , as yet , has scarcely reached fifteen ?</l>
     <l n="42">With such can I be worthy to be seen ?</l>
     <l n="43">Her innocence much added to her charms ,</l>
     <l n="44">The gentle wily god of soft alarms</l>
     <l n="45">Had not a youthful maiden in his book ,</l>
     <l n="46">That carried more temptation in her look .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="47">MOST rev'rend sir , said she , by friends I 'm told ,</l>
     <l n="48">That in this convent wit is often sold ,</l>
     <l n="49">Will you allow me some on trust to take ?</l>
     <l n="50">My treasure wo n't afford that much I stake ;</l>
     <l n="51">I can return if more I should require ;</l>
     <l n="52">Howe'er , you 'll take this pledge I much desire ;</l>
     <l n="53">On which she tried to give the monk a ring ,</l>
     <l n="54">That to her finger firmly seemed to cling .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">BUT when the friar saw the girl 's design ,</l>
     <l n="56">He cried , good maid , the pledge we will decline ,</l>
     <l n="57">And what is wished , provide for you the same ;</l>
     <l n="58">‘ Tis merchandize , and whatsoe'er its fame ,</l>
     <l n="59">To some ‘ tis freely giv'n :— to others taught</l>
     <l n="60">If not too dear , oft better when ‘ tis bought .</l>
     <l n="61">Come in and boldly follow where I lead ;</l>
     <l n="62">None round can see : you 've nothing here to heed ;</l>
     <l n="63">They 're all at prayers ; the porter 's at my will ;</l>
     <l n="64">The very walls , of prudence have their fill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">SHE entered as the holy monk desired ,</l>
     <l n="66">And they together to his cell retired .</l>
     <l n="67">The friar on the bed this maiden threw ;</l>
     <l n="68">A kiss would take :— she from him rather drew ;</l>
     <l n="69">And said .— To give one wit is this the way ?</l>
     <l n="70">Yes , answered he , and round her ‘ gan to play :</l>
     <l n="71">Upon her bosom then he put his hand</l>
     <l n="72">What now , said she , am I to understand ?</l>
     <l n="73">Is this the way ?— Said he , ‘ tis so decreed ;</l>
     <l n="74">Then patiently she let the monk proceed ,</l>
     <l n="75">Who followed up , from point to point , his aim ;</l>
     <l n="76">And wit , by easy steps , advancing came ,</l>
     <l n="77">Till its progression with her was complete ;</l>
     <l n="78">Then Alice laughed , success appeared so sweet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="79">A SECOND dose the friar soon bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="80">And e'en a third , so fast his bounty flowed .</l>
     <l n="81">Well , said the monk , pray how d'ye find the play ?</l>
     <l n="82">The girl replied : wit will not long delay ;</l>
     <l n="83">‘ Twill soon arrive ; but then I fear its flight :</l>
     <l n="84">I 'm half afraid ‘ twill leave me ere ‘ tis night .</l>
     <l n="85">We 'll see , rejoined the priest , that naught you lose ;</l>
     <l n="86">But other secrets oftentimes we use .</l>
     <l n="87">Seek not those the smiling girl replied</l>
     <l n="88">With this most perfectly I 'm satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="89">Then be it so , said he , we 'll recommence ,</l>
     <l n="90">Nor longer keep the business in suspense ,</l>
     <l n="91">But to the utmost length at once advance ;</l>
     <l n="92">For this fair Alice showed much complaisance :</l>
     <l n="93">The secret by the friar was renewed ;</l>
     <l n="94">Much pleasure in it Bonadventure viewed ;</l>
     <l n="95">The belle a courtesy dropt , and then retired ,</l>
     <l n="96">Reflecting on the wit she had acquired ;</l>
     <l n="97">Reflecting , do you say ?— To think inclined ?</l>
     <l n="98">Yes , even more :— she sought excuse to find ,</l>
     <l n="99">Not doubting that she should be forced to say ,</l>
     <l n="100">Some cause for keeping her so long away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="101">TWO days had passed , when came a youthful friend ;</l>
     <l n="102">Fair Nancy with her often would unbend ;</l>
     <l n="103">Howe'er , so very thoughtful Alice seemed ,</l>
     <l n="104">That Nancy ( who was penetrating deemed )</l>
     <l n="105">Was well convinced whatever Alice sought ,</l>
     <l n="106">So very absent she was not for naught .</l>
     <l n="107">In questioning she managed with such art ,</l>
     <l n="108">That soon she learned — what Alice could impart</l>
     <l n="109">To listen she was thoroughly disposed ,</l>
     <l n="110">While t'other ev'ry circumstance disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="111">From first to last , each point and mystick hit ,</l>
     <l n="112">And e'en the largeness of the friar 's wit ,</l>
     <l n="113">The repetitions , and the wondrous skill</l>
     <l n="114">With which he managed ev'ry thing at will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="115">BUT now , cried Alice , favour me I pray ,</l>
     <l n="116">And tell at once , without reserve , the way</l>
     <l n="117">That you obtained such wit as you possess ,</l>
     <l n="118">And all particulars to me confess .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="119">IF I , said Nancy , must avow the truth ,</l>
     <l n="120">Your brother Alan was the bounteous youth ,</l>
     <l n="121">Who me obliged therewith , and freely taught ,</l>
     <l n="122">What from the holy friar you 'd have bought .</l>
     <l n="123">My brother Alan !— Alan ! Alice cried ;</l>
     <l n="124">He ne'er with any was himself supplied ;</l>
     <l n="125">I 'm all surprise ; he 's thought a heavy clot ,</l>
     <l n="126">How could he give what he had never got ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="127">FOOL ! said the other , little thou can'st know ;</l>
     <l n="128">For once , to me some information owe ;</l>
     <l n="129">In such a case much skill is not required ,</l>
     <l n="130">And Alan freely gave what I desired .</l>
     <l n="131">If me thou disbeliev'st , thy mother ask ;</l>
     <l n="132">She thoroughly can undertake the task .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="133">ON such a point we readily should say ,</l>
     <l n="134">Long live the fools who wit so well display !</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE SICK ABBESS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">EXAMPLE often proves of sov'reign use ;</l>
     <l n="2">At other times it cherishes abuse ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis not my purpose , howsoe'er , to tell</l>
     <l n="4">Which of the two I fancy to excel .</l>
     <l n="5">Some will conceive the Abbess acted right ,</l>
     <l n="6">While others think her conduct very light</l>
     <l n="7">Be that as ‘ twill , her actions right or wrong ,</l>
     <l n="8">I 'll freely give a license to my tongue ,</l>
     <l n="9">Or pen , at all events , and clearly show ,</l>
     <l n="10">By what some nuns were led to undergo ,</l>
     <l n="11">That flocks are equally of flesh and blood ,</l>
     <l n="12">And , if one passes , hundreds stem the flood ,</l>
     <l n="13">To follow up the course the first has run ,</l>
     <l n="14">And imitate what t'other has begun .</l>
     <l n="15">When Agnes passed , another sister came ,</l>
     <l n="16">And ev'ry nun desired to do the same ;</l>
     <l n="17">At length the guardian of the flock appeared ,</l>
     <l n="18">And likewise passed , though much at first she feared .</l>
     <l n="19">The tale is this , we purpose to relate ;</l>
     <l n="20">And full particulars we now will state .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="21">AN Abbess once a certain illness had ,</l>
     <l n="22">Chlorosis named , which oft proves very bad ,</l>
     <l n="23">Destroys the rose that decorates the cheek ,</l>
     <l n="24">And renders females languid , pale , and weak .</l>
     <l n="25">Our lady 's face was like a saint 's in Lent :</l>
     <l n="26">Quite wan , though otherwise it marked content .</l>
     <l n="27">The faculty , consulted on her case ,</l>
     <l n="28">And who the dire disorder 's source would trace ,</l>
     <l n="29">At length pronounced slow fever must succeed ,</l>
     <l n="30">And death inevitably be decreed ,</l>
     <l n="31">Unless ;— but this unless is very strange</l>
     <l n="32">Unless indeed she some way could arrange ;</l>
     <l n="33">To gratify her wish , which seemed to vex ,</l>
     <l n="34">And converse be allowed with t'other sex :</l>
     <l n="35">Hippocrates , howe'er , more plainly speaks ,</l>
     <l n="36">No circumlocutory phrase he seeks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">O JESUS ! quite abashed the Abbess cried ;</l>
     <l n="38">What is it ?— fy !— a man would you provide ?</l>
     <l n="39">Yes , they rejoined , ‘ tis clearly what you want ,</l>
     <l n="40">And you will die without a brisk gallant ;</l>
     <l n="41">One truly able will alone suffice ;</l>
     <l n="42">And , if not such , take two we would advise .</l>
     <l n="43">This still was worse , though , if we rightly guess ,</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Twas by her wished , durst she the truth confess .</l>
     <l n="45">But how the sisterhood would see her take</l>
     <l n="46">Such remedies and no objection make ?</l>
     <l n="47">Shame often causes injury and pain ;</l>
     <l n="48">And ills concealed bring others in their train .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">SAID sister Agnes , Madam , take their word ;</l>
     <l n="50">A remedy like this would be absurd ,</l>
     <l n="51">If , like old death , it had a haggard look ,</l>
     <l n="52">And you designed to get by hook or crook .</l>
     <l n="53">A hundred secrets you retain at ease ;</l>
     <l n="54">Can one so greatly shock and you displease ?—</l>
     <l n="55">You talk at random , Agnes , she replied ;</l>
     <l n="56">Now , would you for the remedy decide ,</l>
     <l n="57">Upon your word , if you were in my place ?—</l>
     <l n="58">Yes , madam , said the nun , and think it grace ;</l>
     <l n="59">Still more I 'd do , if necessary thought ;</l>
     <l n="60">Your health , by me , would ev'ry way be sought ,</l>
     <l n="61">And , if required by you to suffer this ,</l>
     <l n="62">Not one around would less appear remiss ;</l>
     <l n="63">Sincere affection for you I have shown ,</l>
     <l n="64">And my regard I 'll ever proudly own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="65">A THOUSAND thanks the Abbess gave her friend ;</l>
     <l n="66">The doctors said :— no use for them to send ;</l>
     <l n="67">Throughout the convent sad distress appeared ;</l>
     <l n="68">When Agnes , who to sage advice adhered ,</l>
     <l n="69">And was not thought the weakest head around ,</l>
     <l n="70">A kinder soul perhaps could not be found ,</l>
     <l n="71">Said to the sisterhood ,— What now retains</l>
     <l n="72">Our worthy Abbess , and her will enchains ,</l>
     <l n="73">Is nothing but the shame of pow'rs divine ,</l>
     <l n="74">Or else , to what 's prescribed she would resign .</l>
     <l n="75">Through charity will no one take the lead ,</l>
     <l n="76">And , by example , get her to proceed ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="77">THE counsel was by ev'ry one approved ,</l>
     <l n="78">And commendation through the circle moved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="79">IN this design not one , nor grave , nor old ,</l>
     <l n="80">Nor young , nor prioress , at all seemed cold ;</l>
     <l n="81">Notes flew around , and friends of worth and taste ,</l>
     <l n="82">The black , the fair , the brown , appeared in haste ;</l>
     <l n="83">The number was not small , our records say ,</l>
     <l n="84">Not ( what might be ) appearance of delay ,</l>
     <l n="85">But all most anxious seemed the road to show ,</l>
     <l n="86">And what the Abbess feared , at once to know ;</l>
     <l n="87">None more sincerely ‘ mong the nuns desired ,</l>
     <l n="88">That shame should not prevent what was required .</l>
     <l n="89">Nor that the Abbess should , within her soul ,</l>
     <l n="90">Retain what might injuriously control .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="91">NO sooner one among the flock had made</l>
     <l n="92">The step , of which the Abbess was afraid ,</l>
     <l n="93">But other sisters followed in the train :—</l>
     <l n="94">Not one behind consented to remain ;</l>
     <l n="95">Each forward pressed , in dread to be the last ;</l>
     <l n="96">At length , from prejudice the Abbess passed ;</l>
     <l n="97">To such examples she at last gave way ,</l>
     <l n="98">And , to a youth , no longer offered nay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="99">THE operation o'er , her lily face</l>
     <l n="100">Resumed the rose , and ev'ry other grace .</l>
     <l n="101">O remedy divine , prescription blessed !</l>
     <l n="102">Thy friendly aid to numbers stands confessed ;</l>

     <l n="5">Not ev'ry time such wishes might arise ,</l>
     <l n="6">But , once in life at least , ‘ twere not unwise ;</l>
     <l n="7">Perhaps one day we may the boon obtain ;</l>
     <l n="8">Amen , I say : my sentiments are plain ;</l>
     <l n="9">The privilege in France may yet arrive</l>
     <l n="10">There trucking pleases , and exchanges thrive ;</l>
     <l n="11">The people love variety , we find ;</l>
     <l n="12">And such by heav'n was ere for them designed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">ONCE there dwelled , near Rouen , ( sapient clime )</l>
     <l n="14">Two villagers , whose wives were in their prime ,</l>
     <l n="15">And rather pleasing in their shape and mien ,</l>
     <l n="16">For those in whom refinement ‘ s scarcely seen .</l>
     <l n="17">Each looker-on conceives , LOVE needs not greet</l>
     <l n="18">Such humble wights , as he would prelates treat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">IT happened , howsoe'er , both weary grown ,</l>
     <l n="20">Of halves that they so long had called their own ;</l>
     <l n="21">One holyday , with them there chanced to drink</l>
     <l n="22">The village lawyer ( bred in Satan 's sink ) ;</l>
     <l n="23">To him , said one of these , with jeering air ,</l>
     <l n="24">Good mister Oudinet , a strange affair</l>
     <l n="25">Is in my head : you 've doubtless often made</l>
     <l n="26">Variety of contracts ; ‘ tis your trade :</l>
     <l n="27">Now , cannot you contrive , by one of these ,</l>
     <l n="28">That men should barter wives , like goods , at ease ?</l>
     <l n="29">Our pastor oft his benefice has changed ;</l>
     <l n="30">Is trucking wives less easily arranged ?</l>
     <l n="31">It cannot be , for well I recollect ,</l>
     <l n="32">That Parson Gregory ( whom none suspect )</l>
     <l n="33">Would always say , or much my mem'ry fails ,</l>
     <l n="34">My flock ‘ s my wife : love equally prevails ;</l>
     <l n="35">He changed ; let us , good neighbour do the same ;</l>
     <l n="36">With all my heart , said t'other , that 's my aim ;</l>
     <l n="37">But well thou know'st that mine 's the fairest face ,</l>
     <l n="38">And , Mister Oudinet , since that 's the case ,</l>
     <l n="39">Should he not add , at least , his mule to boot ?</l>
     <l n="40">My mule ? rejoined the first , that will not suit ;</l>
     <l n="41">In this world ev'ry thing has got its price :</l>
     <l n="42">Mine I will change for thine and that ‘ s concise .</l>
     <l n="43">Wives are not viewed so near ; naught will I add ;</l>
     <l n="44">Why , neighbour Stephen , dost thou think me mad ,</l>
     <l n="45">To give my mule to boot ?— of mules the king ;</l>
     <l n="46">Not e'en an ass I 'd to the bargain bring ;</l>
     <l n="47">Change wife for wife , the barter will be fair ;</l>
     <l n="48">Then each will act with t'other on the square .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">THE village lawyer now the friends addressed :</l>
     <l n="50">Said he , Antoinetta is confessed</l>
     <l n="51">To have superior charms to those of Jane ;</l>
     <l n="52">But still , if I may venture to be plain ,</l>
     <l n="53">Not always is the best what meets the eye ,</l>
     <l n="54">For many beauties in concealment lie ,</l>
     <l n="55">Which I prefer ; and these are hid with care ;</l>
     <l n="56">Deceptions , too , are practised by the FAIR ;</l>
     <l n="57">Howe'er , we wish the whole to be disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="58">Too much , ‘ tis said , they must not be exposed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="59">NOW , neighbours , let us fair arrangement make :</l>
     <l n="60">A pig in poke you 'd neither give nor take ;</l>
     <l n="61">Confront these halves in nature 's birth-day suit ;</l>
     <l n="62">To neither , then , will you deceit impute .</l>
     <l n="63">The project was most thoroughly approved ;</l>
     <l n="64">Like inclination both the husbands moved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="65">ANTOINETTA , said the second spouse ,</l>
     <l n="66">Has neither ill nor scratch her fears to rouse .</l>
     <l n="67">Jane , cried the first , is ev'ry way complete ;</l>
     <l n="68">No freckles on the skin : as balm she 's sweet :</l>
     <l n="69">Antoinetta is , her spouse replied ,</l>
     <l n="70">Ambrosia ev'ry way : no fault to hide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="71">SAID t'other :— Do n't so confident appear ;</l>
     <l n="72">Thou know'st not Jane : her ways would marble cheer ;</l>
     <l n="73">And there 's a play :— thou understand'st no doubt ?</l>
     <l n="74">To this rejoined the second village lout ,</l>
     <l n="75">One diff'rence only have my wife and I :</l>
     <l n="76">Which plays the prettiest wiles is what we try ;</l>
     <l n="77">Thou'lt very soon of these know how to think ;</l>
     <l n="78">Here 's to thee , neighbour ; Mister Oud'net , drink ;</l>
     <l n="79">Come , toast Antoinetta ; likewise Jane ;</l>
     <l n="80">The mule was granted , and the bargain plain :</l>
     <l n="81">Our village lawyer promised to prepare ,</l>
     <l n="82">At once , the writings , which would all declare .</l>
     <l n="83">This Oudinet a good apostle proved</l>
     <l n="84">Well paid for parchment , or he never moved :</l>
     <l n="85">By whom was payment made ?— by both the dames ;</l>
     <l n="86">On neither husband showed he any claims .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="87">THE village clowns some little time supposed</l>
     <l n="88">That all was secret : not a hint disclosed ;</l>
     <l n="89">The parson of it , howsoe'er , obtained</l>
     <l n="90">Some intimation , and his off'rings gained .</l>
     <l n="91">I was not present , fully I admit ;</l>
     <l n="92">But rarely clergymen their dues will quit .</l>
     <l n="93">The very clerk would not remit his fee :—</l>
     <l n="94">All those who serve the church in this agree .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="95">THE permutation could not well be made ,</l>
     <l n="96">But scandal would such practices upbraid ;</l>
     <l n="97">In country villages each step is seen ;</l>
     <l n="98">Thus , round the whisper went of what had been ,</l>
     <l n="99">And placed at length the thorn where all was ease ;</l>
     <l n="100">The pow'rs divine alone it could displease .</l>
     <l n="101">‘ Twas pleasant them together to behold ;</l>
     <l n="102">The wives , in emulation , were not cold ;</l>
     <l n="103">In easy talk they 'd to each other say :</l>
     <l n="104">How pleasing to exchange from day to day !</l>
     <l n="105">What think you , neighbour , if , to try our luck ,</l>
     <l n="106">For once we 've something new , and valets truck ?</l>
     <l n="107">This last , if made , the secret had respect ;</l>
     <l n="108">The other had at first a good effect .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="109">FOR one good month the whole proceeded well ;</l>
     <l n="110">But , at the end , disgust dispersed the spell ;</l>
     <l n="111">And neighbour Stephen , as we might suppose ,</l>
     <l n="112">Began dissatisfaction to disclose ;</l>
     <l n="113">Lamented much Antoinetta 's stop ;</l>
     <l n="114">No doubt he was a loser by the swop ;</l>
     <l n="115">Yet neighbour Giles expressed extreme regret ,</l>
     <l n="116">That t'other from him ought to boot should get :</l>
     <l n="117">Howe'er , he would retrucking not consent ,</l>
     <l n="118">So much he otherwise appeared content .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="119">IT happened on a day , as Stephen strayed</l>
     <l n="120">Within a wood , he saw , beneath a shade ,</l>
     <l n="121">And near the stream , asleep , and quite alone ,</l>
     <l n="122">Antoinetta , whom he wished his own .</l>
     <l n="123">He near her drew , and waked her with surprise ;</l>
     <l n="124">The change ne'er struck her when she ope 'd her eyes ;</l>
     <l n="125">The gay gallant advantage quickly took ,</l>
     <l n="126">And , what he wished , soon placed within his hook .</l>
     <l n="127">‘ Tis said , he found her better than at first ;</l>
     <l n="128">Why so ? you ask : was she then at the worst ?</l>
     <l n="129">A curious question , truly , you 've designed ;</l>
     <l n="130">In Cupid 's am'rous code of laws you 'll find —</l>
     <l n="131">Bread got by stealth , and eat where none can spy ,</l>
     <l n="132">Is better far than what you bake or buy ;</l>
     <l n="133">For proof of this , ask those most learn 'd in love</l>
     <l n="134">Truth we prefer , all other things above ;</l>
     <l n="135">Yet Hymen , and the god of soft desire ,</l>
     <l n="136">How much soe'er their union we admire ,</l>
     <l n="137">Are not designed together bread to bake ;</l>
     <l n="138">In proof , the sleeping scene for instance take .</l>
     <l n="139">Good cheer was there : each dish was served with taste ;</l>
     <l n="140">The god of love , who often cooks in haste ,</l>
     <l n="141">Most nicely seasoned things to relish well ;</l>
     <l n="142">In this he 's thought old Hymen to excel .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="143">ANTOINETTA , to his clasp restored ,</l>
     <l n="144">Our neighbour Stephen , who his wife adored ,</l>
     <l n="145">Quite raw , howe'er , in this , exclaimed apart</l>
     <l n="146">Friend Giles has surely got some secret art ,</l>
     <l n="147">For now my rib displays superior charms ,</l>
     <l n="148">To what she had , before she left my arms .</l>
     <l n="149">Let 's take her back , and play the Norman trick</l>
     <l n="150">Deny the whole , and by our priv'lege stick .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="151">IMMEDIATELY he ev'ry effort tried ,</l>
     <l n="152">To get the bargain fully set aside .</l>
     <l n="153">Giles , much distressed , exerted all his might ,</l>
     <l n="154">To keep his prize , and prove his conduct right .</l>
     <l n="155">The cause was carried to the bishop 's court ;</l>
     <l n="156">Much noise it made , according to report .</l>
     <l n="157">At length the parliament would hear the claim ,</l>
     <l n="158">And judge a case of such peculiar fame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="159">THE village lawyer , Oudinet , was brought ;</l>
     <l n="160">From him , who drew the contract , truth was sought ;</l>
     <l n="161">There rests the cause , for ‘ tis of recent date ;</l>
     <l n="162">While undecided , more we cannot state .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="163">HOW silly neighbour Stephen must appear !</l>
     <l n="164">He went against his int'rest now ‘ tis clear ;</l>
     <l n="165">For , when superior pleasure he was shown ,</l>
     <l n="166">The fascinating fair was not his own .</l>
     <l n="167">Good sense would whisper then , ‘ twere full as well ,</l>
     <l n="168">To let remain with Giles the beauteous belle ;</l>
     <l n="169">Save now and then , within the leafy shade ,</l>
     <l n="170">Where oft Antoinetta visits made ,</l>
     <l n="171">And warbled to the shrubs and trees around ;</l>
     <l n="172">There he might easily the nymph have found ,</l>
     <l n="173">But , if with ease it could not be obtained ,</l>
     <l n="174">Still greater pleasure he would then have gained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="175">GO preach me this to silly country louts ;</l>
     <l n="176">These , howsoe'er , had managed well their bouts ,</l>
     <l n="177">It must not be denied , and all was nice ;</l>
     <l n="178">To do the like perhaps ‘ twill some entice .</l>
     <l n="179">I much regret my lot was not the same ,</l>
     <l n="180">Though doubtless many will my wishes blame .</l>
