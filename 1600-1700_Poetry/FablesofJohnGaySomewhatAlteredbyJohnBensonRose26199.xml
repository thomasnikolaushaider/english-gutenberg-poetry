    <head>DEDICATION .</head>
     <l n="1">Si doulce la Margarite .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When I first saw you — never mind the year — you could speak no English , and when next I saw you , after a lapse of two years , you would prattle no French ; when again we met , you were the nymph with bright and flowing hair , which frightened his Highness Prince James out of his feline senses , when , as you came in by the door , he made his bolt by the window . It was then that you entreated me , with “ most petitionary vehemence , ” to write you a book — a big book — thick , and all for yourself —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Apollo heard , and granting half the prayer ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shuffled to winds the rest and tossed in air . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have not written the book , nor is it thick : but I have printed you a book , and it is thin . And I take the occasion to note that old Geoffry Chaucer , our father poet , must have had you in his mind 's eye , by prescience or precognition , or he could hardly else have written two poems , one on the daisy and one on the rose . They are poems too long for modern days , nor are we equal in patience to our fore-fathers , who read ‘ The Faërie Queen , ’ ‘ Gondibert , ’ and the ‘ Polyolbion , ’ annually , as they cheeringly averred , through and out . Photography , steam , and electricity make us otherwise , and Patience has fled to the spheres ; therefore , if feasible , shall “ brevity be the soul of wit , ” and we will eschew “ tediousness and outward flourishes ” in compressing ‘ The Flower and the Leaf ’ into little :—</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A maiden in greenwood in month of sweet May ,</l>
     <l n="2">Arose and awoke at the dawn of the day :</l>
     <l n="3">As she wended along ,</l>
     <l n="4">She heard fairie song —</l>
     <l n="5">“ Si doulce est la Margarite . ”</l>
     <l n="6">There the Ladye the Flower and Ladye the Leaf ,</l>
     <l n="7">With knights and squires of fairie chief ,</l>
     <l n="8">Were met upon mead ,</l>
     <l n="9">For devoir and deed —</l>
     <l n="10">Homage unto “ La doulce Margarite . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">There the ladye in white and the ladye in green</l>
     <l n="12">Sat on their thrones by the Fairie Queen ,</l>
     <l n="13">Whilst knights did their duty ,</l>
     <l n="14">And bowed down to beauty —</l>
     <l n="15">“ Si doulce est la Margarite , ” —</l>
     <l n="16">When the skies grew hot and the ladies pale ,</l>
     <l n="17">And the storm descended in lightning and hail ,</l>
     <l n="18">As they danced and sung ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the burden rung —</l>
     <l n="20">“ Sous la feuille , sous la feuille , meet . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">Our Ladye of Leaf asked her of the Flower</l>
     <l n="22">And fairie Nymphs to shelter in bower :</l>
     <l n="23">And they danced and sung ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the refrain rung —</l>
     <l n="25">“ Si doulce est la Margarite . ”</l>
     <l n="26">All woe begone shivered the Ladye Flower ,</l>
     <l n="27">The Ladye Leaf glittered in gems from the shower :</l>
     <l n="28">As they danced and sung ,</l>
     <l n="29">And the refrain rung —</l>
     <l n="30">“ Si doulce est la Margarite . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">And knights and squires then wended forth ,</l>
     <l n="32">East and west , and south , and north :</l>
     <l n="33">To free forests and shores</l>
     <l n="34">From giants and boars ,</l>
     <l n="35">And shelter in night and in storm ;</l>
     <l n="36">And every knight bore in chief on his shield</l>
     <l n="37">The foyle en verte on an argent field :</l>
     <l n="38">And they rode and they sung</l>
     <l n="39">The huge oaks among :—</l>
     <l n="40">“ Sous la feuille , sous la feuille , dorme . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">The maiden then asked of the Fairie Queen</l>
     <l n="42">To tell her the moral of what she had seen :</l>
     <l n="43">Who answered and sung</l>
     <l n="44">In her fairie tongue —</l>
     <l n="45">“ Si doulce est la Margarite . ”</l>
     <l n="46">The knight that is wise will lead from bower</l>
     <l n="47">The lasting Leaf — not the fading Flower :</l>
     <l n="48">And when storms arise</l>
     <l n="49">To turmoil life 's skies —</l>
     <l n="50">“ Sous la feuille , sous la feuille , meet . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">Romaunt of the Rose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="52">Within my twentie yeares of age ,</l>
     <l n="53">When Love asserteth most his courage ,</l>
     <l n="54">I dreamed a dream , now fain to tell —</l>
     <l n="55">A dream that pleased me wondrous well .</l>
     <l n="56">Now this dream will I rime aright ,</l>
     <l n="57">To make your heartes gaye and light ;</l>
     <l n="58">For Love desireth it — also</l>
     <l n="59">Commandeth me that it be so .</l>
     <l n="60">It is the Romaunt of the Rose ,</l>
     <l n="61">And tale of love I must disclose .</l>
     <l n="62">Fair is the matter for to make ,</l>
     <l n="63">But fairer — if she will to take</l>
     <l n="64">For whom the romaunt is begonne</l>
     <l n="65">For that I wis she is the fair one</l>
     <l n="66">Of mokle prise ; and therefore she</l>
     <l n="67">So worthier is beloved to be ;</l>
     <l n="68">And well she ought of prise and right</l>
     <l n="69">Be clepened Rose of every wight .</l>
     <l n="70">But it was May , thus dreamed me ,—</l>
     <l n="71">A time of love and jollitie :</l>
     <l n="72">A time there is no husks or straw ,</l>
     <l n="73">But new grene leaves on everie shaw ;</l>
     <l n="74">The woods were grene , the earth was proud ,</l>
     <l n="75">Beastès and birdès snug aloud ;</l>
     <l n="76">And earth her poore estate forgote ,</l>
     <l n="77">In which the winter her had fraught .</l>
     <l n="78">Ah ! ben in May the sunne is bright ,</l>
     <l n="79">And everie thing does take delight :</l>
     <l n="80">The nightingale then singeth blithe ;</l>
     <l n="81">Then is blissful many a scithe ;</l>
     <l n="82">The goldfinch and the popinjay ,</l>
     <l n="83">They then have many things to say .</l>
     <l n="84">Hard is his heart that loveth nought</l>
     <l n="85">In May , when all such love is wrought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="86">Right from my bed full readilie ,</l>
     <l n="87">That it was by the morrow earlie ;</l>
     <l n="88">And up I rose , and gan me clothe</l>
     <l n="89">Anon I with my handès bothe :</l>
     <l n="90">A silver needle forth I drew</l>
     <l n="91">Out of an aguiler quainte inew ,</l>
     <l n="92">And gan this needle threade anone ,</l>
     <l n="93">For out of town me list to gone ,</l>
     <l n="94">Jollife and gaye , full of gladnesse ,</l>
     <l n="95">Towards a river gan I me dresse ,</l>
     <l n="96">For from a hill that stood there neere</l>
     <l n="97">Came down the stream of that rivere —</l>
     <l n="98">My face , I wis , there saw I wele ,</l>
     <l n="99">The bottom ypaved everie dele</l>
     <l n="100">With gravel , which was shining shene ,</l>
     <l n="101">In meadows soft and soote and greene .</l>
     <l n="102">And full attempre out of drede</l>
     <l n="103">Then gan I walken throw the mede</l>
     <l n="104">Downward ever in my playing</l>
     <l n="105">As the river 's waters straying ;</l>
     <l n="106">And when I had awhile igone</l>
     <l n="107">I saw a garden right anone ,</l>
     <l n="108">Of walls with many portraitures ,</l>
     <l n="109">And bothe of images and peintures —</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="125">Which is in Gloucestershire , there unto Bisley ,</l>

     <l n="127">It is not either uncouth , square , or grisly ,</l>

    <head>GAY 'S FABLES .</head>
    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Remote from cities dwelt a swain ,</l>
     <l n="2">Unvexed by petty cares of gain ;</l>
     <l n="3">His head was silvered , and by age</l>
     <l n="4">He had contented grown and sage ;</l>
     <l n="5">In summer 's heat and winter 's cold</l>
     <l n="6">He fed his flock and penned his fold ,</l>
     <l n="7">Devoid of envy or ambition ,</l>
     <l n="8">So had he won a proud position .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">A deep philosopher , whose rules</l>
     <l n="10">Of moral life were drawn from schools ,</l>
     <l n="11">With wonder sought this shepherd 's nest ,</l>
     <l n="12">And his perplexity expressed :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">“ Whence is thy wisdom ? Hath thy toil</l>
     <l n="14">O'er books consumed the midnight oil ,</l>
     <l n="15">Communed o'er Greek and Roman pages ,</l>
     <l n="16">With Plato , Socrates — those sages —</l>
     <l n="17">Or fathomed Tully ,— or hast travelled</l>
     <l n="18">With wise Ulysses , and unravelled</l>
     <l n="19">Of customs half a mundane sphere ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="20">The shepherd answered him : “ I ne'er</l>
     <l n="21">From books or from mankind sought learning ,</l>
     <l n="22">For both will cheat the most discerning ;</l>
     <l n="23">The more perplexed the more they view</l>
     <l n="24">In the wide fields of false and true .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">“ I draw from Nature all I know —</l>
     <l n="26">To virtue friend , to vice a foe .</l>
     <l n="27">The ceaseless labour of the bee</l>
     <l n="28">Prompted my soul to industry ;</l>
     <l n="29">The wise provision of the ant</l>
     <l n="30">Made me for winter provident ;</l>
     <l n="31">My trusty dog there showed the way ,</l>
     <l n="32">And to be true I copy Tray .</l>
     <l n="33">Then for domestic hallowed love ,</l>
     <l n="34">I learnt it of the cooing dove ;</l>
     <l n="35">And love paternal followed , when</l>
     <l n="36">I marked devotion in the hen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="37">“ Nature then prompted me to school</l>
     <l n="38">My tongue from scorn and ridicule ,</l>
     <l n="39">And never with important mien</l>
     <l n="40">In conversation to o'erween .</l>
     <l n="41">I learnt some lessons from the fowls :</l>
     <l n="42">To shun solemnity , from owls ;</l>
     <l n="43">Another lesson from the pie ,—</l>
     <l n="44">Pert and pretentious , and as sly ;</l>
     <l n="45">And to detest man 's raids and mulctures ,</l>
     <l n="46">From eagles , kites , goshawks , and vultures ;</l>
     <l n="47">But most of all abhorrence take</l>
     <l n="48">From the base toad or viler snake ,</l>
     <l n="49">With filthy venom in the bite ,</l>
     <l n="50">Of envies , jealousies , and spite .</l>
     <l n="51">Thus from Dame Nature and Creation</l>
     <l n="52">Have I deduced my observation ;</l>
     <l n="53">Nor found I ever thing so mean ,</l>
     <l n="54">That gave no moral thence to glean . ”</l>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT . The moralist , my dear niece , has said that — “ The man of sense will read a work of note In the like humour as the author wrote . ” To which end we must try to identify the reign of King George I. and the manners of that era with these fables ; for manners change with every age , and every age has its transitions of political and social manners : “ Manners with fortunes , humours turn with climes , Tenets with books , and principles with times . ” It was in the era of the two first Georges that Gay wrote and applied these fables , filled with diatribes against ministers , courtiers , and misers , and inveighing against court corruption and bribery . It was a period of transition , such as had before occurred , from feudal to monarchial , and now from monarchial to ministerial rule . We had entered into another phase — one of civil and religious liberty ; but , at the same time , the royal court was a scene devoid of any graces : the kings could not speak our language , and their feminine favourites were the reverse of fair or virtuous ; whilst domestic hate ruled in the palace . Power then ran into a new groove of corruption and bribery ; and the scene , vile in itself , was made viler by exaggeration and the retaliations of one political party on the other , whilst either side was equally lauded by its own party . Therefore we may reasonably conclude that matters were not so bad as they were painted , and moreover that it was but a change and transition of evils , to play a part and disappear . The advent of the third George to the throne , and the rigid integrity of the first and second Pitt , reversed the story as read in these fables ; the court became pure , the king true , the ministers honest , and the nation progressed from the miserable peace of Utrecht , in 1714 , to the proud position we held on its centenary at Vienna , in 1814 . We may grant , then , that Gay had reason on his side when he inveighed so bitterly against courts and kings ; and , granting that , we may recognise the amelioration of the court of the present day , wholly free from corruption and presenting a school to be followed rather than contemned . In the fable of the ‘ Degenerate Bees , ’ Gay takes the part of the Tory ministry ,— Oxford , Bolingbroke , Dean Swift , and Mat . Prior ; and in the ‘ Ant in Office ’ he alludes to a Whig minister of that day . We must not be too hard on ministers . Kings and the nation have been open to bribes and assenting to French diplomacy ,— “ When policy regained what arms had lost . ” Louis XI . purchased the retreat of Edward IV . in 1475 , when he seized on the domains of King Réné — Provence , Anjou , Maine , Touraine , and Lorraine , and Burgundy from the domains of Charles the Bold ; when we abandoned our blood allies for bribes . Again , in 1681 , Charles II . was the pensioner of Louis XIV ., when Louis seized on Strasbourg . William III . reluctantly let it pass at the peace and treaty of Ryswick , which Louis dictated ; and it was very basely abandoned by us at the peace of Utrecht , in 1714 , when we abandoned our ally the emperor , and the degenerate Bees of the fable suffered exile and the Tower , barely escaping death from the indignant nation . Again , in the treaty of Vienna , 1814 , we sacrificed the interests of Austria to France , in ceding to the latter the pillaged counties of the Messin and of Alsace . Finding , therefore , like results from wholly different causes , we must not be extreme to judge , but , with Gay , admit the ministers of 1714 to grace , for they only then did what we sanctioned in 1814 , and which 1870 sees righted , and the German towns restored to Germany . I am now rounding off half a century in which I have wandered in this wilderness of a world , and in all that time I have never known , or heard of , corruption in a minister of state . I have seen and known many fall untimely to ministerial labours and responsibility . Walking through the streets and squares we may behold the noble brows of Pitt , Canning , Lord George Bentinck , Sir Robert Peel , Lord Palmerston — men “ on whose brows shame is ashamed to sit ” — and , we might add , another Canning , a Follett , Sir George Lewis , and a hecatomb of Colonial rulers , who have died , overtasked by toil and responsibility ; but in all that time we have never heard a minister accused of corruption , or building palaces , or making a fortune from public treasure . Corruption , if so it may still be termed , has taken another phase ; it has bowed its head and courted democracy , like to the Roman king , Ancus Martius , “ nimium gaudens popularibus auris ” — cringing to popular suffrage — to ride into place and power , by granting measures momentarily floating uppermost , and suffering the tail to guide the head , as did the snake in Æsop 's fable . We attained the height of grandeur of 1814 under the guidance of the head , and we are now upon our trial of democratical government , and whether it be equal to the old . Under such auspices commerce has been the petted minion of the last thirty years . Not the native forest tree of Pitt , Huskisson , and Canning , but the hot-bed plant of the advocates of a predominant trade . No British statesman ever dreamt of restricting commerce ,— which ever was the bond of unity of nations ; but we have sunk every interest at home to swell the exports and imports , to make Britain what Egypt was in the days of the patriarch — the storehouse of the world . Egypt and England both put their agriculturists to pain , and the rural population to serfdom ; but they only exchange the stable basis of well-being for an unstable one , for commerce is proverbially of a fleeting nature . The age in which Gay wrote was eminently what we now designate as conservative . Excise was hateful then ; as customs are denounced now , so home taxation was denounced then . So wonderfully do systems change , that in the monthly table of the revenue of this period ( December , 1870 ) , the customs do not raise one-third of the revenue , of which the other two-thirds are raised by home taxation . From ministers proceed we to the misers . I doubt whether any domestic changes have wrought so great an amelioration in our well-being as banks and banking . It has saved us from burglars ; it has , by cheques , redeemed us from the tyranny of tradesmen 's books . It has put personal property on a stronger foundation than it held , and the banker keeps an excellent private account , gratuitously , of your receipts and expenditure . The trouble that the possession of gold gave to its possessor before this wonderful institution was brought to bear , may be told by a few instances of divers epochs . There is a tale of a man who was supposed to have discovered the treasures of Croesus , in the treasury — such as is shown now at Mycenæ and Orchomenos as the treasuries of old . The hero of the tale having discovered the crypt and its hoard , built another , and spent half of his life in secretly removing the treasures of Croesus to his new treasury ; which was no sooner a deed accomplished than he perceived the original treasury was superior to the new , and he spent an equal amount of years in secretly restoring the treasures to their original crypt , where doubtless they are now , for he died whilst he was the slave to the gold . Herodotus has stories quite as marvellous as this , of the fortunate finder of the treasures of Croesus . But our friend Mr. Pepys — who , I believe , has given us more amusement than any other Englishman , be he whom he may — is more amusing and instructive . His story is written in 1667 , the year after the fire of London , and whilst the invasion of the Dutch was apprehended , and we will see how Mr. Pepys fulfilled the adage of “ as much trouble as all my money . ” On 30th March , 1666 , we find him write :— “ I to Lombard St ., and there received 2200l ., and brought it home , and , contrary to expectation , received 35l . for the use of 2000l . of it for a quarter of a year , where it hath produced me this profit , and hath been a conveniency to me as to care and security at my house , and demandable at two days ’ warning , as this has been . ” On 12th November : “ This day I received 450 pieces of gold , which cost me 22-1 / 2d . change . But I am well contented with it , I having now nearly 2800l . in gold , and will not rest till I get full 3000l . ” But on the 13th June , 1667 , on the sad news of the taking of the ‘ Royal Charles , ’ and sinking ships at Barking Creek , “ put me into such a fear , that I presently resolved of my father 's and wife 's going into the country ; and at two hours ’ warning they did go by the coach this day with 1300l . in gold in their night-bag . Pray God give them good passage , and good care to hide it when they come home ! But my heart is full of fear . They gone , I continued in frights and fear what to do with the rest . ” And on the 10th October , when the Dutch were gone , we read :— “ Up , and to walk up and down in the garden with my father , to talk of all our concernments : about a husband for my sister , whereof there is at present no appearance ; but we must endeavour to find her one now , for she grows old and ugly . My father and I with a dark lantern , it being now light , into the garden with my wife , and there went about our great work to dig up my gold . But , Lord , what a tosse I was for some time in , that they could not justly tell where it was : but by-and-bye , poking with a spit , we found it , and then began with a spudd . But , good God ! to see how sillily they did it , not half a foot under ground , and in the sight of the world from a hundred places , and within sight of a neighbour 's window . Only my father says that he saw them all gone to church before he began the work when he laid the money . But I was out of my wits almost , and the more from that , upon my lifting the earth with my spudd , I did discern that I had scattered the pieces of gold in the loose earth , and , taking up the iron head-pieces whereon they were put , I perceived the earth had gotten among the gold , and wet , so that the bags were all rotten and notes ; so that I could not tell what in the world to say to it , not knowing how to judge what was wanting , or what had been lost by Gibson in his journey down , which , all put together , did make me mad . And at last I was obliged to take up the pieces , dirt and all , by candle-light , and carry them into my brother 's chamber , and there lock them up , whilst I eat a little supper ; and then , all people going to bed , William Hewer and I did , all alone , with pails of water and besoms , wash the dirt off the pieces , and then began to tell them , by a note which I had of the value of the whole in my pocket , and do find that there was short above a hundred pieces , which did make me mad .... So William Hewer and I out again about midnight , and there by candle-light did make shift to gather forty pieces more ; and so to bed , and there lay in some disquiet until daylight . 11th .— And then William Hewer and I , with pails and a sieve , did lock ourselves into the garden , and did gather the earth and then sift those pails in one of the summer-houses ( just as they do for diamonds in other parts ) , and there , to our great content did , by nine o'clock , make the last night 's forty-five up to seventy-nine ; so that we are come to some twenty or thirty of what I think the true number should be . So do leave my father to make a second examination of the dirt , and my mind at rest on it , being but an accident ; and so give me some kind of content to remember how painful it is sometimes to keep money as well as to get it , and how doubtful I was to keep it all night , and how to secure it to London . “ About ten o'clock , took coach , my wife and I , and Willett and W. Hewer , and Mumford and Bowles ( whom my lady sent me to go along with me my journey , not telling her the reason , but it was only to secure my gold ) , and my brother John on horseback ; and with these four I thought myself pretty safe . My gold I put into a basket , and set it under one of the seats ; and so my work every quarter of an hour was to look to see whether all was well ; and I did ride in great fear all the day . 12th .— By five o'clock got home , and did bring my gold to my heart 's content very safe , having not this day carried it in a basket , but in our hands ; the girl took care of one , and my wife of another bag , and I the rest , I being afraid of the bottom of the coach lest it should break . ” Such is Mr. Pepys ’ story . “ Nor light nor darkness brings his pains relief : One shows the plunder , and one hides the thief . ” Mr. Crabbe has portrayed the marvel of an honest inhabitant of Aldborough , when first he learnt , in his graphic phrase , “ that money would breed , ” — that it could afford to pay yearly interest . Shakespeare has several references to the fact . Shylock , and a clown in ‘ Twelfth Night ’ making very quaint allusions . I shall only add one more tale from Mr. S. Trench 's late stories of ‘ Realities of Irish Life . ’ A neighbour , who had saved two hundred pounds in gold , kept it in the thatch of his roof . One day he appeared before Mr. Trench bearing his gold , and requesting him to be his depositee , expressing the comfort it would afford him . Mr. Trench declined the unprofitable duty , and pointed out to him the bank , which would accept his deposit and give him interest . The eye of Patrick flashed with intelligence and foresight as he warned Mr. Trench from the delusion of banks , which every year wasted the original sum by paying the stipend , and when you wished to reclaim the original , lo , it had disappeared . No , no , he would have no dividend , forsooth , to eat away his capital ; which he bore back again ( about five pounds ’ weight ) and replaced it in his thatch . It was neither lost nor wasted there ; it became the inheritance of his only daughter , a woman of extreme energy , who had from childhood loved — more , methinks , as a mother loves a helpless child — a good-hearted , unvicious piece of indolence and sloth . She followed him to New York and married him , nolens volens ; and Providence assigned to him an energetic woman , to make his castle of indolence a bed of roses to the satisfaction of them both ,— supplying for each the energy and the repose , both constitutional , both unvicious , which the other lacked . Highwaymen beset the highways , as burglars invaded the residences ; and Macaulay chuckles over the fact that his bête noire — the noble Marlborough — was eased of 5000l . in gold in one of his trips between London and St. Alban 's . From the regions of ministers and misers we may descend to the equally disputed realms of the muses . Horace terms it “ the peevish and inhuman muse , ” which those who drink of Aganippe 's fountain woo ; whilst others are apt to equal their Castalian spring and Parnassus with the height of the empyreal , regarding with pity the toilers on the land and deep . But herein , as in aught else , it is the mind , and not the outward circumstances , which makes the happiness suited to its strength and position ; for it must be confessed it is from the weak in bodily frame , the lame , and the blind , that we draw our poets : and when we find a rare bodily exception to the rule , we find too often a mind insatiate of applause , and pining for more appreciation of their productions . The votaries of the muse cannot be set down as so happy and contented as many a ploughman , nor does the smoothness of the lines gratify the eye more than the smoothness of the furrow . But these rhymes of Gay hardly aspire to the height of poesy , nor do they possess the banter and raciness , such as we find in Butler 's ‘ Hudibras ':— “ When oyster-women lock their fish up , And trudge away to bawl , ‘ No bishop ! ’ ” Neither has it the deep pathos of the Spenserian stanza , which perhaps strives at the deepest vein of poetry . Take two of Thomson 's , for example :— “ O mortal man , who livest here by toil , Do not complain of this thy hard estate ; That like an emmet thou must ever moil , Is a hard sentence of an ancient date : And , certes , there is for it reason great ; For though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail , And curse thy star , and early drudge and late , Withouten that would come a heavier bale ,— Loose life , unruly passions , and diseases pale . ” And another stanza runs thus :— “ I care not , Fortune , what you me deny : You cannot rob me of free Nature 's grace ; You cannot shut the windows of the sky , Through which Aurora shows her brightening face ; You cannot bar my constant feet to trace The woods and lawns by living stream at eve . Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace , And I their toys to the great children leave ; Of fancy , reason , virtue , nought can me bereave . ” Such is the stanza in which are written Spenser 's ‘ Faërie Queen , ’ Thomson 's ‘ Castle of Indolence , ’ and Byron 's ‘ Childe Harold , ’ and it is the highest flight of poetry : after which comes the heroic verse , in which we lap the heavy poems we call epic — their Latin appellation ; of these the Iliads of Homer and the Æneids of Virgil are the ever recurring aspirations of poets doomed to fall untimely . The charm of Homer is that it is not only a poem , but it instructs us in the history — all that we know of it — of those prehistoric days . It is full of ballads , which are the ground-work by which we trace the manners and the tenets of the pagan tribes . The truth involved in ‘ Homer ’ is the charm of his epic poem , while the falsehood involved in the ‘ Henriade ’ of Voltaire is amply sufficient to condemn it utterly . For a specimen let us take Pope 's ‘ Homer , ’ where Hector answers Andromache 's appeal to stay and guard the walls of Troy :— “ The chief replied , ‘ That post shall be my care ; Nor that alone , but all the works of war ; Still foremost let me stand to guard the throne , To save my father 's honours and my own : Yet come it will , the day decreed by Fates — How my heart trembles whilst my tongue relates — That day when thou , imperial Troy , must bend , Must see thy warriors fall , thy glories end . And yet no presage dire so wounds my mind — My mother 's death , the ruin of my kind — As thine , Andromache , thy griefs I dread . I see thee weeping , trembling , captive led . In Argive looms our battles to design , Woes — of which woes so large a part was thine ; To bear the victor 's hard commands , or bring The waters from the Hypereian spring . There , whilst you groan beneath the load of life , They cry “ Behold the Trojan Hector 's wife ! ” Some Argive , who shall live thy griefs to see , Embitters thy great woe by naming me : The thoughts of glory past and present shame , A thousand griefs , shall waken at the name . May I lie cold before that dreadful day , Pressed by a load of monumental clay Thy Hector , wrapped in everlasting sleep , Shall neither hear thee sigh nor see thee weep . ’ ” Next in pathos is the mournful elegy ; of which none can surpass Gray 's elegy :— “ The boast of heraldry , the pomp of power , And all that beauty , all that wealth e'er gave , Alike await the inevitable hour ; The paths of glory lead but to the grave . Can storied urn or animated bust Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath ? Can honour 's voice provoke the silent dust , Or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death ? Full many a gem of purest ray serene The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear ; Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , And waste its sweetness on the desert air . Let not ambition mock our useful toil , Our homely joys and destiny obscure , Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile The short and simple annals of the poor : Their names , their years spelt by the untaught Muse , The place of fame and elegy supply , And many a holy text around she strews , To teach the rustic moralist to die . ” Nursery rhymes , old ballads , odes , sonnets , epigrams , travesties , fables , satires , and eclogues , and , most of all , songs , provide daily pleasure for us from our cradle to the grave . Every language has its nursery rhymes , which are a sort of Delphian lot , sung in enigma from ‘ King Pittacus of Mytilene ’ and ‘ Le bon Roi Dagobert , ’ to the lullaby of ‘ Four-and-twenty Blackbirds . ’ There is as much sarcasm in nursery rhymes as there is of pride and boast in the songs of bards at the feast of heroes , and as there is of humble confession in the funeral psalm . Song tends alike to evaporate exuberant spirits , and to soothe the soul in an affliction — as Desdemona informs us so sweetly in her misery :— “ My mother had a maid called Barbara ; She was in love : and he she loved proved mad , And did forsake her . She had a song of willow , An old thing ‘ twas ; but it expressed her fortune , And she died singing it . That song to-night Will not go from my mind : I have much to do , But to go hang my head all of one side , And sing it like poor Barbara . ” Ophelia chanted as she floated down the brook , Arion tamed the flood , and Orpheus the trees and rocks . It is a marvellous power which soothes alike the babe in the arms and the hero at the feast , the lover and the forsaken maiden , which leads to battle and returns from conquest ; therefore let us see the ODE , in ‘ Eton Revisited ':— “ Ah , happy hills ! ah , pleasing shade ! Ah , fields beloved in vain ! Where once my careless boyhood strayed A stranger yet to pain . I feel the gales that from ye blow A momentary bliss bestow , As waving fresh their gladsome wing My weary soul they seem to soothe , And redolent of joy and youth , To breathe a second spring . Whilst some on earnest labour bent Their business , murmuring , ply ‘ Gainst graver hours that bring constraint To sweeten liberty ; Some bold adventurers disdain The limits of the little reign And unknown regions dare descry ; Still as they run they look behind , And hear a voice in every wind , And snatch a fearful joy . To each his sufferings , all are men Condemned alike to groan ; The tender , for another 's pain — The unfeeling , for his own . Yet , ah ! why should they know their fate , Since sorrow never comes too late ; And happiness too swiftly flies ? Thought would destroy their paradise . No more : ‘ where ignorance is bliss , ‘ Tis folly to be wise . ’ ” Let me add four lines from Denham 's poem , ‘ On Cooper 's Hill , ’ addressing the River Thames :— “ O could I flow like thee , and make thy stream My great example , as it is my theme ! Though deep yet clear , though gentle yet not dull , Strong without rage , without o'erflowing full . ” Our old ballads are very fine : the opening of ‘ Chevy Chase ’ is equal to ‘ Wrath , Goddess sing the Wrath of Achilles , ’ or ‘ Arms and the Man : ’ — “ The Persé owt of Northumberland , And a vowe to Godde made he , That he would hunt in the mountains Of Cheviot within days three . In maugre of doughty Douglas And all that ever with him be , The fattest hartes in all Cheviot , He said , to kill and bear away . ‘ By my faith ! ’ quoth the doughty Douglas then , ‘ I will lette that hunting , gif I may . ’ Worde is commen to Eddenburrowe To James , the Scottish King , That doughty Douglas , Lyfftenant of Marches , Lay slain Chevyot hills within . His handdes did James weal and wryng , Sighing , ‘ Alas ! and woe is me — Such another captain Scotland within I trow there will never be ! ’ Worde is commen to lovely Londone Till the fourth Harry , our King , That Lord Persé , Lyfftenant of Marches , Lay slain Cheviot hills within . ‘ God have mercy on his soul ! ’ said Kyng Harry , ‘ Good Lord , if thy will it be . I have a hondrith Captains in Englonde As good as ever was he ; But Persé , and I brook my lyffe Thy death well quit shall be . ’ This was the honting off the Cheviot ‘ That tear beganne this spurn : ’ Old men that known the ground well enough Call it the battle of Otterburn . At Otterburn began this spurn Upon a Monnynday ; There was the doughtie Douglas slain , The Persé went captive away . ” But of every species of poetry none are so rife with life and beauty as the song . It conjoins music with words , and brevity with sweetness . There is no position in which man does not sing ,— in joy to express it , and in woe to relieve it : in company in chorus , and alone for companionship . Sir Walter Scott has imagined the minstrel to sing :— “ I have song of war for knight , Lay of love for ladye bright , Fairie tale to lull the heir , Goblin grim the maid to scare . If you pity kith or kin , Take the wandering harper in . ” But songs are like the flowers of the field : each age hath its own , which fade and perish and make way for another crop , and every age claims its own . For melody , terseness , and beauty of words , the song excels more than any other form of poetry ; and they are wise who have a private collection of the songs which , like swallows , come and disappear . It may appear strange to print the Fables of Gay , and say no word of our author ; but the truth is that it is unkind to withdraw the veil of privacy from any man 's life . Doctor Johnson did an unkind deed when he wrote the ‘ Lives of the Poets ; ’ for which he was fully repaid when Boswell flayed him bare as ever Apollo flayed Marsyas , and exposed all the quivering nerves to the light of day . Of all classes of men , the class of poets most need the concealing veil : the greatest have been blind ; the next greatest halt , and the remainder weak or deformed of frame . Debarred the healthier paths of life , man rushes for employment to the refuging muse ; and rightly so , for he finds an employment ornamental and useful still . But solitude does not nurture the virtues of the soul more than physical defect does that of the body , and the withdrawal of the curtain divulges a very sad sight of discontent and envy . Homer himself is recorded to have ejaculated his aspiration to be the favourite of the Greek girls and boys . A poet seer loves no brother near his throne , and is but too apt to complain of non-appreciation of his muse on the part of the world . The fault rather is in their own too sensitive souls ; and it is a fact that there is scarcely a name in the roll of poets , whose fame is not harmed by divulging his exotic life . The rural labourer 's fate — “ Where to be born and die , Of rich and poor , make all the history ” — is far better than to be paraded from the disobedience of youth , the rebellion of manhood , and the disappointment of age , divulged in the storied lives of the few hundred names admitted to be British poets ; and the reading of whose works is , as a rule , a task of weariness . The career of Gay is a very fair one as an average of the poetic . He mainly avoided the enumerated ills — enumerated by Dr. Johnson — “ Toil , envy , want , the patron , and the jail . ” The poetic element in Britain was very strong in the days of Gay . Pope , Swift , Prior , Addison were the petted servants of the Ministers . They were all far more successful in their careers than was Gay , who from his boyhood refused to labour for his bread . Very early he found a patroness in the Duchess of Monmouth , who had “ Wept over Monmouth 's bloody tomb , ” with whom he enjoyed a sort of honorary post — secretary to the shadow of a princess ; next he became a real secretary to the Earl of Clarendon , Ambassador at Hanover , as Prior had been to the Ambassador at Paris . We easily trace in Gay 's career the unsatisfied overweening poetic soul , like a Charybdis , insatiable of adulation . In 1716 , the Earl of Burlington cheered him at his seat in Devon ; in 1717 , he accompanied Mr. Pulteney to Aix ; in 1718 , Lord Harcourt soothed his spirits . Then he made money , which burnt holes in his pockets . He called his friends together , to ask how he should invest . His poetic friends Pope and Swift advised him to sink it in an annuity . But fate or fortune cast him in with Secretary Craggs and the South Sea scheme , and , from the possessor of 20 , 000l ., his capital collapsed to nil . In vain he had been bidden to sell and to realize . He had visions of wealth , and held on to be accidentally an honester man than if he had enriched himself by that delusive scheme ; but he nearly sunk beneath his disappointment , and his health was endangered . Hope and the Muse restored him to more life and to more disappointment . He then wrote ‘ The Captive , ’ obtained an appointment to read it to the Princess of Wales , stumbled , like Cæsar , over a stool ; the princess screamed , the omen was a true one — ‘ The Captive ’ pined and died . In 1726 he wrote these Fables , dedicating them to the Duke of Cumberland , and in 1727 his royal patron succeeded to the crown ; when he was offered the post of Gentleman Usher to the Princess Louisa . Gay was hurt and indignant , and made court to Mrs. Howard ( afterwards Countess of Suffolk ) , one of the anomalous favourites alluded to in page 131 , but in vain . Then came the great success of his ‘ Beggars ’ Opera , ’ which was followed by ‘ Polly , ’ its sequel . ‘ Polly ’ was forbidden by the Lord Chamberlain , and a private subscription raised 1200l . to recompense Gay for not being suffered to please the mob with his immorality . And , lastly , the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry took this child of nature by the hand — the duke to manage his worldly substance , and the duchess to soothe his insatiable vanity — and so he died at the early age of 45 , and has a very pretty tomb , with “ Queensberry weeping o'er his urn , ” in Poets ’ Corner . Pope 's epitaph runs thus :— “ Blest be the gods for those they took away , And those they left me , for they left me Gay . Left me to see deserted genius bloom , Neglected die , and tell it on his tomb ; Of all his blameless life the sole return My verse and Queensberry weeping o'er his urn . ” Peace with his dust ! Another couplet of Pope 's , methinks , has more of moral truth and justice :— “ A wit 's a feather , and a chief 's a rod ; An honest man 's the noblest work of God . ” +—————————————————————————+</note>
