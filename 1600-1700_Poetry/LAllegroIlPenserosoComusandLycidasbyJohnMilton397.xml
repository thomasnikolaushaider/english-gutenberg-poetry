     <l n="2">HENCE , loathed Melancholy ,</l>
     <l n="3">............ Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born</l>
     <l n="4">In Stygian cave forlorn</l>
     <l n="5">............' Mongst horrid shapes , and shrieks , and sights</l>
     <l n="6">unholy !</l>
     <l n="7">Find out some uncouth cell ,</l>
     <l n="8">............ Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the night-raven sings ;</l>
     <l n="10">............ There , under ebon shades and low-browed rocks ,</l>
     <l n="11">As ragged as thy locks ,</l>
     <l n="12">............ In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell .</l>
     <l n="13">But come , thou Goddess fair and free ,</l>
     <l n="14">In heaven yclept Euphrosyne ,</l>
     <l n="15">And by men heart-easing Mirth ;</l>
     <l n="16">Whom lovely Venus , at a birth ,</l>
     <l n="17">With two sister Graces more ,</l>
     <l n="18">To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore :</l>
     <l n="19">Or whether ( as some sager sing )</l>
     <l n="20">The frolic wind that breathes the spring ,</l>
     <l n="21">Zephyr , with Aurora playing ,</l>
     <l n="22">As he met her once a-Maying ,</l>
     <l n="23">There , on beds of violets blue ,</l>
     <l n="24">And fresh-blown roses washed in dew ,</l>
     <l n="25">Filled her with thee , a daughter fair ,</l>
     <l n="26">So buxom , blithe , and debonair .</l>
     <l n="27">Haste thee , Nymph , and bring with thee</l>
     <l n="28">Jest , and youthful Jollity ,</l>
     <l n="29">Quips and cranks and wanton wiles ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nods and becks and wreathed smiles</l>
     <l n="31">Such as hang on Hebe 's cheek ,</l>
     <l n="32">And love to live in dimple sleek ;</l>
     <l n="33">Sport that wrinkled Care derides ,</l>
     <l n="34">And Laughter holding both his sides .</l>
     <l n="35">Come , and trip it , as you go ,</l>
     <l n="36">On the light fantastic toe ;</l>
     <l n="37">And in thy right hand lead with thee</l>
     <l n="38">The mountain-nymph , sweet Liberty ;</l>
     <l n="39">And , if I give thee honour due ,</l>
     <l n="40">Mirth , admit me of thy crew ,</l>
     <l n="41">To live with her , and live with thee ,</l>
     <l n="42">In unreproved pleasures free :</l>
     <l n="43">To hear the lark begin his flight ,</l>
     <l n="44">And , singing , startle the dull night ,</l>
     <l n="45">From his watch-tower in the skies ,</l>
     <l n="46">Till the dappled dawn doth rise ;</l>
     <l n="47">Then to come , in spite of sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="48">And at my window bid good-morrow ,</l>
     <l n="49">Through the sweet-briar or the vine ,</l>
     <l n="50">Or the twisted eglantine ;</l>
     <l n="51">While the cock , with lively din ,</l>
     <l n="52">Scatters the rear of darkness thin ,</l>
     <l n="53">And to the stack , or the barn-door ,</l>
     <l n="54">Stoutly struts his dames before :</l>
     <l n="55">Oft listening how the hounds and horn</l>
     <l n="56">Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn ,</l>
     <l n="57">From the side of some hoar hill ,</l>
     <l n="58">Through the high wood echoing shrill :</l>
     <l n="59">Sometime walking , not unseen ,</l>
     <l n="60">By hedgerow elms , on hillocks green ,</l>
     <l n="61">Right against the eastern gate</l>
     <l n="62">Where the great Sun begins his state ,</l>
     <l n="63">Robed in flames and amber light ,</l>
     <l n="64">The clouds in thousand liveries dight ;</l>
     <l n="65">While the ploughman , near at hand ,</l>
     <l n="66">Whistles o'er the furrowed land ,</l>
     <l n="67">And the milkmaid singeth blithe ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the mower whets his scythe ,</l>
     <l n="69">And every shepherd tells his tale</l>
     <l n="70">Under the hawthorn in the dale .</l>
     <l n="71">Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures ,</l>
     <l n="72">Whilst the landskip round it measures :</l>
     <l n="73">Russet lawns , and fallows grey ,</l>
     <l n="74">Where the nibbling flocks do stray ;</l>
     <l n="75">Mountains on whose barren breast</l>
     <l n="76">The labouring clouds do often rest ;</l>
     <l n="77">Meadows trim , with daisies pied ;</l>
     <l n="78">Shallow brooks , and rivers wide ;</l>
     <l n="79">Towers and battlements it sees</l>
     <l n="80">Bosomed high in tufted trees ,</l>
     <l n="81">Where perhaps some beauty lies ,</l>
     <l n="82">The cynosure of neighbouring eyes .</l>
     <l n="83">Hard by a cottage chimney smokes</l>
     <l n="84">From betwixt two aged oaks ,</l>
     <l n="85">Where Corydon and Thyrsis met</l>
     <l n="86">Are at their savoury dinner set</l>
     <l n="87">Of herbs and other country messes ,</l>
     <l n="88">Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses ;</l>
     <l n="89">And then in haste her bower she leaves ,</l>
     <l n="90">With Thestylis to bind the sheaves ;</l>
     <l n="91">Or , if the earlier season lead ,</l>
     <l n="92">To the tanned haycock in the mead .</l>
     <l n="93">Sometimes , with secure delight ,</l>
     <l n="94">The upland hamlets will invite ,</l>
     <l n="95">When the merry bells ring round ,</l>
     <l n="96">And the jocund rebecks sound</l>
     <l n="97">To many a youth and many a maid</l>
     <l n="98">Dancing in the chequered shade ,</l>
     <l n="99">And young and old come forth to play</l>
     <l n="100">On a sunshine holiday ,</l>
     <l n="101">Till the livelong daylight fail :</l>
     <l n="102">Then to the spicy nut-brown ale ,</l>
     <l n="103">With stories told of many a feat ,</l>
     <l n="104">How Faery Mab the junkets eat .</l>
     <l n="105">She was pinched and pulled , she said ;</l>
     <l n="106">And he , by Friar 's lantern led ,</l>
     <l n="107">Tells how the drudging goblin sweat</l>
     <l n="108">To earn his cream-bowl duly set ,</l>
     <l n="109">When in one night , ere glimpse of morn ,</l>
     <l n="110">His shadowy flail hath threshed the corn</l>
     <l n="111">That ten day-labourers could not end ;</l>
     <l n="112">Then lies him down , the lubber fiend ,</l>
     <l n="113">And , stretched out all the chimney 's length ,</l>
     <l n="114">Basks at the fire his hairy strength ,</l>
     <l n="115">And crop-full out of doors he flings ,</l>
     <l n="116">Ere the first cock his matin rings .</l>
     <l n="117">Thus done the tales , to bed they creep ,</l>
     <l n="118">By whispering winds soon lulled asleep .</l>
     <l n="119">Towered cities please us then ,</l>
     <l n="120">And the busy hum of men ,</l>
     <l n="121">Where throngs of knights and barons bold ,</l>
     <l n="122">In weeds of peace , high triumphs hold</l>
     <l n="123">With store of ladies , whose bright eyes</l>
     <l n="124">Rain influence , and judge the prize</l>
     <l n="125">Of wit or arms , while both contend</l>
     <l n="126">To win her grace whom all commend .</l>
     <l n="127">There let Hymen oft appear</l>
     <l n="128">In saffron robe , with taper clear ,</l>
     <l n="129">And pomp , and feast , and revelry ,</l>
     <l n="130">With mask and antique pageantry ;</l>
     <l n="131">Such sights as youthful poets dream</l>
     <l n="132">On summer eves by haunted stream .</l>
     <l n="133">Then to the well-trod stage anon ,</l>
     <l n="134">If Jonson 's learned sock be on ,</l>
     <l n="135">Or sweetest Shakespeare , Fancy 's child ,</l>
     <l n="136">Warble his native wood-notes wild .</l>
     <l n="137">And ever , against eating cares ,</l>
     <l n="138">Lap me in soft Lydian airs ,</l>
     <l n="139">Married to immortal verse ,</l>
     <l n="140">Such as the meeting soul may pierce ,</l>
     <l n="141">In notes with many a winding bout</l>
     <l n="142">Of linked sweetness long drawn out</l>
     <l n="143">With wanton heed and giddy cunning ,</l>
     <l n="144">The melting voice through mazes running ,</l>
     <l n="145">Untwisting all the chains that tie</l>
     <l n="146">The hidden soul of harmony ;</l>
     <l n="147">That Orpheus ’ self may heave his head</l>
     <l n="148">From golden slumber on a bed</l>
     <l n="149">Of heaped Elysian flowers , and hear</l>
     <l n="150">Such strains as would have won the ear</l>
     <l n="151">Of Pluto to have quite set free</l>
     <l n="152">His half-regained Eurydice .</l>
     <l n="153">These delights if thou canst give ,</l>
     <l n="154">Mirth , with thee I mean to live .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>IL PENSEROSO</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="155">HENCE , vain deluding Joys ,</l>
     <l n="156">............ The brood of Folly without father bred !</l>
     <l n="157">How little you bested</l>
     <l n="158">............ Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys !</l>
     <l n="159">Dwell in some idle brain ,</l>
     <l n="160">............ And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess ,</l>
     <l n="161">As thick and numberless</l>
     <l n="162">............ As the gay motes that people the sun-beams ,</l>
     <l n="163">Or likest hovering dreams ,</l>
     <l n="164">............ The fickle pensioners of Morpheus ’ train .</l>
     <l n="165">But , hail ! thou Goddess sage and holy !</l>
     <l n="166">Hail , divinest Melancholy !</l>
     <l n="167">Whose saintly visage is too bright</l>
     <l n="168">To hit the sense of human sight ,</l>
     <l n="169">And therefore to our weaker view</l>
     <l n="170">O'erlaid with black , staid Wisdom 's hue ;</l>
     <l n="171">Black , but such as in esteem</l>
     <l n="172">Prince Memnon 's sister might beseem ,</l>
     <l n="173">Or that starred Ethiop queen that strove</l>
     <l n="174">To set her beauty 's praise above</l>
     <l n="175">The Sea-Nymphs , and their powers offended .</l>
     <l n="176">Yet thou art higher far descended :</l>
     <l n="177">Thee bright-haired Vesta long of yore</l>
     <l n="178">To solitary Saturn bore ;</l>
     <l n="179">His daughter she ; in Saturn 's reign</l>
     <l n="180">Such mixture was not held a stain .</l>
     <l n="181">Oft in glimmering bowers and glades</l>
     <l n="182">He met her , and in secret shades</l>
     <l n="183">Of woody Ida 's inmost grove ,</l>
     <l n="184">Whilst yet there was no fear of Jove .</l>
     <l n="185">Come , pensive Nun , devout and pure ,</l>
     <l n="186">Sober , steadfast , and demure ,</l>
     <l n="187">All in a robe of darkest grain ,</l>
     <l n="188">Flowing with majestic train ,</l>
     <l n="189">And sable stole of cypress lawn</l>
     <l n="190">Over thy decent shoulders drawn .</l>
     <l n="191">Come ; but keep thy wonted state ,</l>
     <l n="192">With even step , and musing gait ,</l>
     <l n="193">And looks commercing with the skies ,</l>
     <l n="194">Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes :</l>
     <l n="195">There , held in holy passion still ,</l>
     <l n="196">Forget thyself to marble , till</l>
     <l n="197">With a sad leaden downward cast</l>
     <l n="198">Thou fix them on the earth as fast .</l>
     <l n="199">And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet ,</l>
     <l n="200">Spare Fast , that oft with gods doth diet ,</l>
     <l n="201">And hears the Muses in a ring</l>
     <l n="202">Aye round about Jove 's altar sing ;</l>
     <l n="203">And add to these retired Leisure ,</l>
     <l n="204">That in trim gardens takes his pleasure ;</l>
     <l n="205">But , first and chiefest , with thee bring</l>
     <l n="206">Him that yon soars on golden wing ,</l>
     <l n="207">Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne ,</l>
     <l n="208">The Cherub Contemplation ;</l>
     <l n="209">And the mute Silence hist along ,</l>
     <l n="210">‘ Less Philomel will deign a song ,</l>
     <l n="211">In her sweetest saddest plight ,</l>
     <l n="212">Smoothing the rugged brow of Night ,</l>
     <l n="213">While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke</l>
     <l n="214">Gently o'er the accustomed oak .</l>
     <l n="215">Sweet bird , that shunn'st the noise of folly ,</l>
     <l n="216">Most musical , most melancholy !</l>
     <l n="217">Thee , chauntress , oft the woods among</l>
     <l n="218">I woo , to hear thy even-song ;</l>
     <l n="219">And , missing thee , I walk unseen</l>
     <l n="220">On the dry smooth-shaven green ,</l>
     <l n="221">To behold the wandering moon ,</l>
     <l n="222">Riding near her highest noon ,</l>
     <l n="223">Like one that had been led astray</l>
     <l n="224">Through the heaven 's wide pathless way ,</l>
     <l n="225">And oft , as if her head she bowed ,</l>
     <l n="226">Stooping through a fleecy cloud .</l>
     <l n="227">Oft , on a plat of rising ground ,</l>
     <l n="228">I hear the far-off curfew sound ,</l>
     <l n="229">Over some wide-watered shore ,</l>
     <l n="230">Swinging slow with sullen roar ;</l>
     <l n="231">Or , if the air will not permit ,</l>
     <l n="232">Some still removed place will fit ,</l>
     <l n="233">Where glowing embers through the room</l>
     <l n="234">Teach light to counterfeit a gloom ,</l>
     <l n="235">Far from all resort of mirth ,</l>
     <l n="236">Save the cricket on the hearth ,</l>
     <l n="237">Or the bellman 's drowsy charm</l>
     <l n="238">To bless the doors from nightly harm .</l>
     <l n="239">Or let my lamp , at midnight hour ,</l>
     <l n="240">Be seen in some high lonely tower ,</l>
     <l n="241">Where I may oft outwatch the Bear ,</l>
     <l n="242">With thrice great Hermes , or unsphere</l>
     <l n="243">The spirit of Plato , to unfold</l>
     <l n="244">What worlds or what vast regions hold</l>
     <l n="245">The immortal mind that hath forsook</l>
     <l n="246">Her mansion in this fleshly nook ;</l>
     <l n="247">And of those demons that are found</l>
     <l n="248">In fire , air , flood , or underground ,</l>
     <l n="249">Whose power hath a true consent</l>
     <l n="250">With planet or with element .</l>
     <l n="251">Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy</l>
     <l n="252">In sceptred pall come sweeping by ,</l>
     <l n="253">Presenting Thebes , or Pelops ’ line ,</l>
     <l n="254">Or the tale of Troy divine ,</l>
     <l n="255">Or what ( though rare ) of later age</l>
     <l n="256">Ennobled hath the buskined stage .</l>
     <l n="257">But , O sad Virgin ! that thy power</l>
     <l n="258">Might raise Musaeus from his bower ;</l>
     <l n="259">Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing</l>
     <l n="260">Such notes as , warbled to the string ,</l>
     <l n="261">Drew iron tears down Pluto 's cheek ,</l>
     <l n="262">And made Hell grant what love did seek ;</l>
     <l n="263">Or call up him that left half-told</l>
     <l n="264">The story of Cambuscan bold ,</l>
     <l n="265">Of Camball , and of Algarsife ,</l>
     <l n="266">And who had Canace to wife ,</l>
     <l n="267">That owned the virtuous ring and glass ,</l>
     <l n="268">And of the wondrous horse of brass</l>
     <l n="269">On which the Tartar king did ride ;</l>
     <l n="270">And if aught else great bards beside</l>
     <l n="271">In sage and solemn tunes have sung ,</l>
     <l n="272">Of turneys , and of trophies hung ,</l>
     <l n="273">Of forests , and enchantments drear ,</l>
     <l n="274">Where more is meant than meets the ear .</l>
     <l n="275">Thus , Night , oft see me in thy pale career ,</l>
     <l n="276">Till civil-suited Morn appear ,</l>
     <l n="277">Not tricked and frounced , as she was wont</l>
     <l n="278">With the Attic boy to hunt ,</l>
     <l n="279">But kerchieft in a comely cloud</l>
     <l n="280">While rocking winds are piping loud ,</l>
     <l n="281">Or ushered with a shower still ,</l>
     <l n="282">When the gust hath blown his fill ,</l>
     <l n="283">Ending on the rustling leaves ,</l>
     <l n="284">With minute-drops from off the eaves .</l>
     <l n="285">And , when the sun begins to fling</l>
     <l n="286">His flaring beams , me , Goddess , bring</l>
     <l n="287">To arched walks of twilight groves ,</l>
     <l n="288">And shadows brown , that Sylvan loves ,</l>
     <l n="289">Of pine , or monumental oak ,</l>
     <l n="290">Where the rude axe with heaved stroke</l>
     <l n="291">Was never heard the nymphs to daunt ,</l>
     <l n="292">Or fright them from their hallowed haunt .</l>
     <l n="293">There , in close covert , by some brook ,</l>
     <l n="294">Where no profaner eye may look ,</l>
     <l n="295">Hide me from day 's garish eye ,</l>
     <l n="296">While the bee with honeyed thigh ,</l>
     <l n="297">That at her flowery work doth sing ,</l>
     <l n="298">And the waters murmuring ,</l>
     <l n="299">With such consort as they keep ,</l>
     <l n="300">Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep .</l>
     <l n="301">And let some strange mysterious dream</l>
     <l n="302">Wave at his wings , in airy stream</l>
     <l n="303">Of lively portraiture displayed ,</l>
     <l n="304">Softly on my eyelids laid ;</l>
     <l n="305">And , as I wake , sweet music breathe</l>
     <l n="306">Above , about , or underneath ,</l>
     <l n="307">Sent by some Spirit to mortals good ,</l>
     <l n="308">Or the unseen Genius of the wood .</l>
     <l n="309">But let my due feet never fail</l>
     <l n="310">To walk the studious cloister 's pale ,</l>
     <l n="311">And love the high embowed roof ,</l>
     <l n="312">With antique pillars massy proof ,</l>
     <l n="313">And storied windows richly dight ,</l>
     <l n="314">Casting a dim religious light .</l>
     <l n="315">There let the pealing organ blow ,</l>
     <l n="316">To the full-voiced quire below ,</l>
     <l n="317">In service high and anthems clear ,</l>
     <l n="318">As may with sweetness , through mine ear ,</l>
     <l n="319">Dissolve me into ecstasies ,</l>
     <l n="320">And bring all Heaven before mine eyes .</l>
     <l n="321">And may at last my weary age</l>
     <l n="322">Find out the peaceful hermitage ,</l>
     <l n="323">The hairy gown and mossy cell ,</l>
     <l n="324">Where I may sit and rightly spell</l>
     <l n="325">Of every star that heaven doth shew ,</l>
     <l n="326">And every herb that sips the dew ,</l>
     <l n="327">Till old experience do attain</l>
     <l n="328">To something like prophetic strain .</l>
     <l n="329">These pleasures , Melancholy , give ;</l>
     <l n="330">And I with thee will choose to live .</l>

     <l n="5">The ATTENDANT SPIRIT descends or enters .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">BEFORE the starry threshold of Jove 's court</l>
     <l n="7">My mansion is , where those immortal shapes</l>
     <l n="8">Of bright aerial spirits live insphered</l>
     <l n="9">In regions mild of calm and serene air ,</l>
     <l n="10">Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot</l>
     <l n="11">Which men call Earth , and , with low-thoughted care ,</l>
     <l n="12">Confined and pestered in this pinfold here ,</l>
     <l n="13">Strive to keep up a frail and feverish being ,</l>
     <l n="14">Unmindful of the crown that Virtue gives ,</l>
     <l n="15">After this mortal change , to her true servants</l>
     <l n="16">Amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats .</l>
     <l n="17">Yet some there be that by due steps aspire</l>
     <l n="18">To lay their just hands on that golden key</l>
     <l n="19">That opes the palace of eternity .</l>
     <l n="20">To Such my errand is ; and , but for such ,</l>
     <l n="21">I would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds</l>
     <l n="22">With the rank vapours of this sin-worn mould .</l>
     <l n="23">But to my task . Neptune , besides the sway</l>
     <l n="24">Of every salt flood and each ebbing stream ,</l>
     <l n="25">Took in by lot , ‘ twixt high and nether Jove ,</l>
     <l n="26">Imperial rule of all the sea-girt isles</l>
     <l n="27">That , like to rich and various gems , inlay</l>
     <l n="28">The unadorned bosom of the deep ;</l>
     <l n="29">Which he , to grace his tributary gods ,</l>
     <l n="30">By course commits to several government ,</l>
     <l n="31">And gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns</l>
     <l n="32">And wield their little tridents . But this Isle ,</l>
     <l n="33">The greatest and the best of all the main ,</l>
     <l n="34">He quarters to his blue-haired deities ;</l>
     <l n="35">And all this tract that fronts the falling sun</l>
     <l n="36">A noble Peer of mickle trust and power</l>
     <l n="37">Has in his charge , with tempered awe to guide</l>
     <l n="38">An old and haughty nation , proud in arms :</l>
     <l n="39">Where his fair offspring , nursed in princely lore ,</l>
     <l n="40">Are coming to attend their father 's state ,</l>
     <l n="41">And new-intrusted sceptre . But their way</l>
     <l n="42">Lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood ,</l>
     <l n="43">The nodding horror of whose shady brows</l>
     <l n="44">Threats the forlorn and wandering passenger ;</l>
     <l n="45">And here their tender age might suffer peril ,</l>
     <l n="46">But that , by quick command from sovran Jove ,</l>
     <l n="47">I was despatched for their defence and guard :</l>
     <l n="48">And listen why ; for I will tell you now</l>
     <l n="49">What never yet was heard in tale or song ,</l>
     <l n="50">From old or modern bard , in hall or bower .</l>
     <l n="51">Bacchus , that first from out the purple grape</l>
     <l n="52">Crushed the sweet poison of misused wine ,</l>
     <l n="53">After the Tuscan mariners transformed ,</l>
     <l n="54">Coasting the Tyrrhene shore , as the winds listed ,</l>
     <l n="55">On Circe 's island fell . ( Who knows not Circe ,</l>
     <l n="56">The daughter of the Sun , whose charmed cup</l>
     <l n="57">Whoever tasted lost his upright shape ,</l>
     <l n="58">And downward fell into a grovelling swine ? )</l>
     <l n="59">This Nymph , that gazed upon his clustering locks ,</l>
     <l n="60">With ivy berries wreathed , and his blithe youth ,</l>
     <l n="61">Had by him , ere he parted thence , a son</l>
     <l n="62">Much like his father , but his mother more ,</l>
     <l n="63">Whom therefore she brought up , and Comus named :</l>
     <l n="64">Who , ripe and frolic of his full-grown age ,</l>
     <l n="65">Roving the Celtic and Iberian fields ,</l>
     <l n="66">At last betakes him to this ominous wood ,</l>
     <l n="67">And , in thick shelter of black shades imbowered ,</l>
     <l n="68">Excels his mother at her mighty art ;</l>
     <l n="69">Offering to every weary traveller</l>
     <l n="70">His orient liquor in a crystal glass ,</l>
     <l n="71">To quench the drouth of Phoebus ; which as they taste</l>
     <l n="72">( For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst ) ,</l>
     <l n="73">Soon as the potion works , their human count'nance ,</l>
     <l n="74">The express resemblance of the gods , is changed</l>
     <l n="75">Into some brutish form of wolf or bear ,</l>
     <l n="76">Or ounce or tiger , hog , or bearded goat ,</l>
     <l n="77">All other parts remaining as they were .</l>
     <l n="78">And they , so perfect is their misery ,</l>
     <l n="79">Not once perceive their foul disfigurement ,</l>
     <l n="80">But boast themselves more comely than before ,</l>
     <l n="81">And all their friends and native home forget ,</l>
     <l n="82">To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty .</l>
     <l n="83">Therefore , when any favoured of high Jove</l>
     <l n="84">Chances to pass through this adventurous glade ,</l>
     <l n="85">Swift as the sparkle of a glancing star</l>
     <l n="86">I shoot from heaven , to give him safe convoy ,</l>
     <l n="87">As now I do . But first I must put off</l>
     <l n="88">These my sky-robes , spun out of Iris ’ woof ,</l>
     <l n="89">And take the weeds and likeness of a swain</l>
     <l n="90">That to the service of this house belongs ,</l>
     <l n="91">Who , with his soft pipe and smooth-dittied song ,</l>
     <l n="92">Well knows to still the wild winds when they roar ,</l>
     <l n="93">And hush the waving woods ; nor of less faith</l>
     <l n="94">And in this office of his mountain watch</l>
     <l n="95">Likeliest , and nearest to the present aid</l>
     <l n="96">Of this occasion . But I hear the tread</l>
     <l n="97">Of hateful steps ; I must be viewless now .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>COMUS enters , with a charming-rod in one hand , his glass in the other : with him a rout of monsters , headed like sundry sorts of wild beasts , but otherwise like men and women , their apparel glistering . They come in making a riotous and unruly noise , with torches in their hands .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">COMUS . The star that bids the shepherd fold</l>
     <l n="2">Now the top of heaven doth hold ;</l>
     <l n="3">And the gilded car of day</l>
     <l n="4">His glowing axle doth allay</l>
     <l n="5">In the steep Atlantic stream ;</l>
     <l n="6">And the slope sun his upward beam</l>
     <l n="7">Shoots against the dusky pole ,</l>
     <l n="8">Pacing toward the other goal</l>
     <l n="9">Of his chamber in the east .</l>
     <l n="10">Meanwhile , welcome joy and feast ,</l>
     <l n="11">Midnight shout and revelry ,</l>
     <l n="12">Tipsy dance and jollity .</l>
     <l n="13">Braid your locks with rosy twine ,</l>
     <l n="14">Dropping odours , dropping wine .</l>
     <l n="15">Rigour now is gone to bed ;</l>
     <l n="16">And Advice with scrupulous head ,</l>
     <l n="17">Strict Age , and sour Severity ,</l>
     <l n="18">With their grave saws , in slumber lie .</l>
     <l n="19">We , that are of purer fire ,</l>
     <l n="20">Imitate the starry quire ,</l>
     <l n="21">Who , in their nightly watchful spheres ,</l>
     <l n="22">Lead in swift round the months and years .</l>
     <l n="23">The sounds and seas , with all their finny drove ,</l>
     <l n="24">Now to the moon in wavering morrice move ;</l>
     <l n="25">And on the tawny sands and shelves</l>
     <l n="26">Trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves .</l>
     <l n="27">By dimpled brook and fountain-brim ,</l>
     <l n="28">The wood-nymphs , decked with daisies trim ,</l>
     <l n="29">Their merry wakes and pastimes keep :</l>
     <l n="30">What hath night to do with sleep ?</l>
     <l n="31">Night hath better sweets to prove ;</l>
     <l n="32">Venus now wakes , and wakens Love .</l>
     <l n="33">Come , let us our rights begin ;</l>
     <l n="34">‘ T is only daylight that makes sin ,</l>
     <l n="35">Which these dun shades will ne'er report .</l>
     <l n="36">Hail , goddess of nocturnal sport ,</l>
     <l n="37">Dark-veiled Cotytto , to whom the secret flame</l>
     <l n="38">Of midnight torches burns ! mysterious dame ,</l>
     <l n="39">That ne'er art called but when the dragon womb</l>
     <l n="40">Of Stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom ,</l>
     <l n="41">And makes one blot of all the air !</l>
     <l n="42">Stay thy cloudy ebon chair ,</l>
     <l n="43">Wherein thou ridest with Hecat ’ , and befriend</l>
     <l n="44">Us thy vowed priests , till utmost end</l>

     <l n="46">Ere the blabbing eastern scout ,</l>
     <l n="47">The nice Morn on the Indian steep ,</l>
     <l n="48">From her cabined loop-hole peep ,</l>
     <l n="49">And to the tell-tale Sun descry</l>
     <l n="50">Our concealed solemnity .</l>

     <l n="54">Break off , break off ! I feel the different pace</l>
     <l n="55">Of some chaste footing near about this ground .</l>
     <l n="56">Run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees ;</l>
     <l n="57">Our number may affright . Some virgin sure</l>
     <l n="58">( For so I can distinguish by mine art )</l>
     <l n="59">Benighted in these woods ! Now to my charms ,</l>
     <l n="60">And to my wily trains : I shall ere long</l>
     <l n="61">Be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed</l>
     <l n="62">About my mother Circe . Thus I hurl</l>
     <l n="63">My dazzling spells into the spongy air ,</l>
     <l n="64">Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion ,</l>
     <l n="65">And give it false presentments , lest the place</l>
     <l n="66">And my quaint habits breed astonishment ,</l>
     <l n="67">And put the damsel to suspicious flight ;</l>
     <l n="68">Which must not be , for that 's against my course .</l>
     <l n="69">I , under fair pretence of friendly ends ,</l>
     <l n="70">And well-placed words of glozing courtesy ,</l>
     <l n="71">Baited with reasons not unplausible ,</l>
     <l n="72">Wind me into the easy-hearted man ,</l>
     <l n="73">And hug him into snares . When once her eye</l>
     <l n="74">Hath met the virtue of this magic dust ,</l>
     <l n="75">I shall appear some harmless villager</l>
     <l n="76">Whom thrift keeps up about his country gear .</l>
     <l n="77">But here she comes ; I fairly step aside ,</l>
     <l n="78">And hearken , if I may her business hear .</l>

     <l n="79">The LADY enters .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="80">LADY . This way the noise was , if mine ear be true ,</l>
     <l n="81">My best guide now . Methought it was the sound</l>
     <l n="82">Of riot and ill-managed merriment ,</l>
     <l n="83">Such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe</l>
     <l n="84">Stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds ,</l>
     <l n="85">When , for their teeming flocks and granges full ,</l>
     <l n="86">In wanton dance they praise the bounteous Pan ,</l>
     <l n="87">And thank the gods amiss . I should be loth</l>
     <l n="88">To meet the rudeness and swilled insolence</l>
     <l n="89">Of such late wassailers ; yet , oh ! where else</l>
     <l n="90">Shall I inform my unacquainted feet</l>
     <l n="91">In the blind mazes of this tangled wood ?</l>
     <l n="92">My brothers , when they saw me wearied out</l>
     <l n="93">With this long way , resolving here to lodge</l>
     <l n="94">Under the spreading favour of these pines ,</l>
     <l n="95">Stepped , as they said , to the next thicket-side</l>
     <l n="96">To bring me berries , or such cooling fruit</l>
     <l n="97">As the kind hospitable woods provide .</l>
     <l n="98">They left me then when the grey-hooded Even ,</l>
     <l n="99">Like a sad votarist in palmer 's weed ,</l>
     <l n="100">Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus ’ wain .</l>
     <l n="101">But where they are , and why they came not back ,</l>
     <l n="102">Is now the labour of my thoughts . ‘ Tis likeliest</l>
     <l n="103">They had engaged their wandering steps too far ;</l>
     <l n="104">And envious darkness , ere they could return ,</l>
     <l n="105">Had stole them from me . Else , O thievish Night ,</l>
     <l n="106">Why shouldst thou , but for some felonious end ,</l>
     <l n="107">In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars</l>
     <l n="108">That Nature hung in heaven , and filled their lamps</l>
     <l n="109">With everlasting oil to give due light</l>
     <l n="110">To the misled and lonely traveller ?</l>
     <l n="111">This is the place , as well as I may guess ,</l>
     <l n="112">Whence even now the tumult of loud mirth</l>
     <l n="113">Was rife , and perfect in my listening ear ;</l>
     <l n="114">Yet nought but single darkness do I find .</l>
     <l n="115">What might this be ? A thousand fantasies</l>
     <l n="116">Begin to throng into my memory ,</l>
     <l n="117">Of calling shapes , and beckoning shadows dire ,</l>
     <l n="118">And airy tongues that syllable men 's names</l>
     <l n="119">On sands and shores and desert wildernesses .</l>
     <l n="120">These thoughts may startle well , but not astound</l>
     <l n="121">The virtuous mind , that ever walks attended</l>
     <l n="122">By a strong siding champion , Conscience .</l>
     <l n="123">O , welcome , pure-eyed Faith , white-handed Hope ,</l>
     <l n="124">Thou hovering angel girt with golden wings ,</l>
     <l n="125">And thou unblemished form of Chastity !</l>
     <l n="126">I see ye visibly , and now believe</l>
     <l n="127">That He , the Supreme Good , to whom all things ill</l>
     <l n="128">Are but as slavish officers of vengeance ,</l>
     <l n="129">Would send a glistering guardian , if need were ,</l>
     <l n="130">To keep my life and honour unassailed . . . .</l>
     <l n="131">Was I deceived , or did a sable cloud</l>
     <l n="132">Turn forth her silver lining on the night ?</l>
     <l n="133">I did not err : there does a sable cloud</l>
     <l n="134">Turn forth her silver lining on the night ,</l>
     <l n="135">And casts a gleam over this tufted grove .</l>
     <l n="136">I cannot hallo to my brothers , but</l>
     <l n="137">Such noise as I can make to be heard farthest</l>
     <l n="138">I 'll venture ; for my new-enlivened spirits</l>
     <l n="139">Prompt me , and they perhaps are not far off .</l>

     <l n="456">Tending my flocks hard by i ’ the hilly crofts</l>

     <l n="460">Doing abhorred rites to Hecate</l>
     <l n="461">In their obscured haunts of inmost bowers .</l>
     <l n="462">Yet have they many baits and guileful spells</l>
     <l n="463">To inveigle and invite the unwary sense</l>
     <l n="464">Of them that pass unweeting by the way .</l>
     <l n="465">This evening late , by then the chewing flocks</l>

     <l n="473">Till fancy had her fill . But ere a close</l>
     <l n="474">The wonted roar was up amidst the woods ,</l>
     <l n="475">And filled the air with barbarous dissonance ;</l>
     <l n="476">At which I ceased , and listened them awhile ,</l>
     <l n="477">Till an unusual stop of sudden silence</l>
     <l n="478">Gave respite to the drowsy-flighted steeds</l>
     <l n="479">That draw the litter of close-curtained Sleep .</l>
     <l n="480">At last a soft and solemn-breathing sound</l>
     <l n="481">Rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes ,</l>
     <l n="482">And stole upon the air , that even Silence</l>
     <l n="483">Was took ere she was ware , and wished she might</l>
     <l n="484">Deny her nature , and be never more ,</l>
     <l n="485">Still to be so displaced . I was all ear ,</l>
     <l n="486">And took in strains that might create a soul</l>
     <l n="487">Under the ribs of Death . But , oh ! ere long</l>
     <l n="488">Too well I did perceive it was the voice</l>

   <p>The Scene changes to a stately palace , set out with all manner of deliciousness : soft music , tables spread with all dainties . Comus appears with his rabble , and the LADY set in an enchanted chair ; to whom he offers his glass ; which she puts by , and goes about to rise .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">COMUS . Nay , Lady , sit . If I but wave this wand ,</l>
     <l n="2">Your nerves are all chained up in alabaster ,</l>
     <l n="3">And you a statue , or as Daphne was ,</l>

     <l n="13">When the fresh blood grows lively , and returns</l>
     <l n="14">Brisk as the April buds in primrose season .</l>
     <l n="15">And first behold this cordial julep here ,</l>
     <l n="16">That flames and dances in his crystal bounds ,</l>
     <l n="17">With spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed .</l>
     <l n="18">Not that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone</l>

     <l n="57">Covering the earth with odours , fruits , and flocks ,</l>
     <l n="58">Thronging the seas with spawn innumerable ,</l>
     <l n="59">But all to please and sate the curious taste ?</l>

     <l n="79">And so bestud with stars , that they below</l>
     <l n="80">Would grow inured to light , and come at last</l>

     <l n="84">Beauty is Nature 's coin ; must not be hoarded ,</l>

     <l n="7">Yet stay : be not disturbed ; now I bethink me ,</l>
     <l n="8">Some other means I have which may be used ,</l>
     <l n="9">Which once of Meliboeus old I learnt ,</l>
     <l n="10">The soothest shepherd that e'er piped on plains .</l>
     <l n="11">There is a gentle Nymph not far from hence ,</l>
     <l n="12">That with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream :</l>
     <l n="13">Sabrina is her name : a virgin pure ;</l>
     <l n="14">Whilom she was the daughter of Locrine ,</l>
     <l n="15">That had the sceptre from his father Brute .</l>
     <l n="16">She , guiltless damsel , flying the mad pursuit</l>
     <l n="17">Of her enraged stepdame , Guendolen ,</l>
     <l n="18">Commended her fair innocence to the flood</l>
     <l n="19">That stayed her flight with his cross-flowing course .</l>
     <l n="20">The water-nymphs , that in the bottom played ,</l>
     <l n="21">Held up their pearled wrists , and took her in ,</l>
     <l n="22">Bearing her straight to aged Nereus ’ hall ;</l>
     <l n="23">Who , piteous of her woes , reared her lank head ,</l>
     <l n="24">And gave her to his daughters to imbathe</l>
     <l n="25">In nectared lavers strewed with asphodil ,</l>
     <l n="26">And through the porch and inlet of each sense</l>
     <l n="27">Dropt in ambrosial oils , till she revived ,</l>
     <l n="28">And underwent a quick immortal change ,</l>
     <l n="29">Made Goddess of the river . Still she retains</l>
     <l n="30">Her maiden gentleness , and oft at eve</l>
     <l n="31">Visits the herds along the twilight meadows ,</l>
     <l n="32">Helping all urchin blasts , and ill-luck signs</l>
     <l n="33">That the shrewd meddling elf delights to make ,</l>
     <l n="34">Which she with precious vialed liquors heals :</l>
     <l n="35">For which the shepherds , at their festivals ,</l>
     <l n="36">Carol her goodness loud in rustic lays ,</l>
     <l n="37">And throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream</l>
     <l n="38">Of pansies , pinks , and gaudy daffodils .</l>
     <l n="39">And , as the old swain said , she can unlock</l>
     <l n="40">The clasping charm , and thaw the numbing spell ,</l>
     <l n="41">If she be right invoked in warbled song ;</l>
     <l n="42">For maidenhood she loves , and will be swift</l>
     <l n="43">To aid a virgin , such as was herself ,</l>
     <l n="44">In hard-besetting need . This will I try ,</l>
     <l n="45">And add the power of some adjuring verse .</l>

  <p>LYCIDAS</p>
   <p>In this Monody the author bewails a learned Friend , unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish Seas , 1637 ; and , by occasion , foretells the ruin of our corrupted Clergy , then in their height .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">YET once more , O ye laurels , and once more ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ye myrtles brown , with ivy never sere ,</l>
     <l n="3">I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude ,</l>
     <l n="4">And with forced fingers rude</l>
     <l n="5">Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year .</l>
     <l n="6">Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear</l>
     <l n="7">Compels me to disturb your season due ;</l>
     <l n="8">For Lycidas is dead , dead ere his prime ,</l>
     <l n="9">Young Lycidas , and hath not left his peer .</l>
     <l n="10">Who would not sing for Lycidas ? he knew</l>
     <l n="11">Himself to sing , and build the lofty rhyme .</l>
     <l n="12">He must not float upon his watery bier</l>
     <l n="13">Unwept , and welter to the parching wind ,</l>
     <l n="14">Without the meed of some melodious tear .</l>
     <l n="15">Begin , then , Sisters of the sacred well</l>
     <l n="16">That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring ;</l>
     <l n="17">Begin , and somewhat loudly sweep the string .</l>

     <l n="21">And as he passes turn ,</l>
     <l n="22">And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud !</l>
     <l n="23">For we were nursed upon the self-same hill ,</l>
     <l n="24">Fed the same flock , by fountain , shade , and rill ;</l>
     <l n="25">Together both , ere the high lawns appeared</l>
     <l n="26">Under the opening eyelids of the Morn ,</l>
     <l n="27">We drove a-field , and both together heard</l>
     <l n="28">What time the grey-fly winds her sultry horn ,</l>
     <l n="29">Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night ,</l>
     <l n="30">Oft till the star that rose at evening bright</l>
     <l n="31">Toward heaven 's descent had sloped his westering wheel .</l>

     <l n="35">From the glad sound would not be absent long ;</l>
     <l n="36">And old Damoetas loved to hear our song .</l>
     <l n="37">But , oh ! the heavy change , now thou art gone ,</l>
     <l n="38">Now thou art gone and never must return !</l>
     <l n="39">Thee , Shepherd , thee the woods and desert caves ,</l>

     <l n="41">And all their echoes , mourn .</l>
     <l n="42">The willows , and the hazel copses green ,</l>
     <l n="43">Shall now no more be seen</l>
     <l n="44">Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays .</l>
     <l n="45">As killing as the canker to the rose ,</l>
     <l n="46">Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze ,</l>
     <l n="47">Or frost to flowers , that their gay wardrobe wear ,</l>
     <l n="48">When first the white-thorn blows ;</l>

     <l n="51">Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas ?</l>

     <l n="60">Whom universal nature did lament ,</l>
     <l n="61">When , by the rout that made the hideous roar ,</l>
     <l n="62">His gory visage down the stream was sent ,</l>
     <l n="63">Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore ?</l>
     <l n="64">Alas ! what boots it with uncessant care</l>
     <l n="65">To tend the homely , slighted , shepherd 's trade ,</l>
     <l n="66">And strictly meditate the thankless Muse ?</l>
     <l n="67">Were it not better done , as others use ,</l>
     <l n="68">To sport with Amaryllis in the shade ,</l>
     <l n="69">Or with the tangles of Neaera 's hair ?</l>

     <l n="102">That sunk so low that sacred head of thine .</l>
     <l n="103">Next , Camus , reverend sire , went footing slow ,</l>
     <l n="104">His mantle hairy , and his bonnet sedge ,</l>
     <l n="105">Inwrought with figures dim , and on the edge</l>
     <l n="106">Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe .</l>
     <l n="107">“ Ah ! who hath reft , ” quoth he , “ my dearest pledge ? ”</l>
     <l n="108">Last came , and last did go ,</l>
     <l n="109">The Pilot of the Galilean Lake ;</l>
     <l n="110">Two massy keys he bore of metals twain .</l>
     <l n="111">( The golden opes , the iron shuts amain ) .</l>
     <l n="112">He shook his mitred locks , and stern bespake :—</l>
     <l n="113">“ How well could I have spared for thee , young swain ,</l>
     <l n="114">Enow of such as , for their bellies ’ sake ,</l>
     <l n="115">Creep , and intrude , and climb into the fold !</l>
     <l n="116">Of other care they little reckoning make</l>
     <l n="117">Than how to scramble at the shearers ’ feast ,</l>
     <l n="118">And shove away the worthy bidden guest .</l>
     <l n="119">Blind mouths ! that scarce themselves know how to hold</l>
     <l n="120">A sheep-hook , or have learnt aught else the least</l>
     <l n="121">That to the faithful herdman 's art belongs !</l>
     <l n="122">What recks it them ? What need they ? They are sped :</l>
     <l n="123">And , when they list , their lean and flashy songs</l>
     <l n="124">Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw ;</l>
     <l n="125">The hungry sheep look up , and are not fed ,</l>
     <l n="126">But , swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw ,</l>
     <l n="127">Rot inwardly , and foul contagion spread ;</l>
     <l n="128">Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw</l>
     <l n="129">Daily devours apace , and nothing said .</l>
     <l n="130">But that two-handed engine at the door</l>
     <l n="131">Stands ready to smite once , and smite no more . ”</l>
     <l n="132">Return , Alpheus ; the dread voice is past</l>
     <l n="133">That shrunk thy streams ; return Sicilian Muse ,</l>
     <l n="134">And call the vales , and bid them hither cast</l>
     <l n="135">Their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues .</l>
     <l n="136">Ye valleys low , where the mild whispers use</l>
     <l n="137">Of shades , and wanton winds , and gushing brooks ,</l>
     <l n="138">On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks ,</l>
     <l n="139">Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes ,</l>
     <l n="140">That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers ,</l>
     <l n="141">And purple all the ground with vernal flowers .</l>
     <l n="142">Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies ,</l>
     <l n="143">The tufted crow-toe , and pale jessamine ,</l>
     <l n="144">The white pink , and the pansy freaked with jet ,</l>
     <l n="145">The glowing violet ,</l>
     <l n="146">The musk-rose , and the well-attired woodbine ,</l>
     <l n="147">With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head ,</l>
     <l n="148">And every flower that sad embroidery wears ;</l>
     <l n="149">Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed ,</l>
     <l n="150">And daffadillies fill their cups with tears ,</l>
     <l n="151">To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies .</l>
     <l n="152">For so , to interpose a little ease ,</l>
     <l n="153">Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise ,</l>
     <l n="154">Ay me ! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas</l>
     <l n="155">Wash far away , where'er thy bones are hurled ;</l>
     <l n="156">Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides ,</l>
     <l n="157">Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide</l>
     <l n="158">Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world ;</l>
     <l n="159">Or whether thou , to our moist vows denied ,</l>
     <l n="160">Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old ,</l>
     <l n="161">Where the great Vision of the guarded mount</l>
     <l n="162">Looks toward Namancos and Bayona 's hold .</l>
     <l n="163">Look homeward , Angel , now , and melt with ruth :</l>
     <l n="164">And , O ye dolphins , waft the hapless youth .</l>
     <l n="165">Weep no more , woeful shepherds , weep no more ,</l>
     <l n="166">For Lycidas , your sorrow , is not dead ,</l>
     <l n="167">Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor .</l>
     <l n="168">So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed ,</l>
     <l n="169">And yet anon repairs his drooping head ,</l>
     <l n="170">And tricks his beams , and with new-spangled ore</l>
     <l n="171">Flames in the forehead of the morning sky :</l>
     <l n="172">So Lycidas sunk low , but mounted high ,</l>
     <l n="173">Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves ,</l>
     <l n="174">Where , other groves and other streams along ,</l>
     <l n="175">With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves ,</l>
     <l n="176">And hears the unexpressive nuptial song ,</l>
     <l n="177">In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love .</l>
     <l n="178">There entertain him all the Saints above ,</l>
     <l n="179">In solemn troops , and sweet societies ,</l>
     <l n="180">That Sing , and singing in their glory move ,</l>
     <l n="181">And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes .</l>
     <l n="182">Now , Lycidas , the shepherds weep no more ;</l>
     <l n="183">Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore ,</l>
     <l n="184">In thy large recompense , and shalt be good</l>
     <l n="185">To all that wander in that perilous flood .</l>
     <l n="186">Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills ,</l>
     <l n="187">While the still morn went out with sandals grey :</l>
     <l n="188">He touched the tender stops of various quills ,</l>
     <l n="189">With eager thought warbling his Doric lay :</l>
     <l n="190">And now the sun had stretched out all the hills ,</l>
     <l n="191">And now was dropt into the western bay .</l>
     <l n="192">At last he rose , and twitched his mantle blue :</l>
     <l n="193">Tomorrow to fresh woods , and pastures new .</l>
