     <l n="5">When first she put the covering on ,</l>
     <l n="6">Her robe of innocence was gone ;</l>

    <head>THE SLUGGARD .</head>

     <l n="1">‘ Tis the voice of the Sluggard : I heard him complain ,</l>
     <l n="2">‘ You have waked me too soon ! I must slumber again ! ’</l>
     <l n="3">As the door on its hinges , so he on his bed</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">‘ A little more sleep , and a little more slumber ! ’</l>
     <l n="6">Thus he wastes half his days and his hours without number ;</l>
     <l n="7">And when he gets up he sits folding his hands ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or walks about sauntering , or trifling he stands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I pass 'd by his garden , and saw the wild brier ,</l>
     <l n="10">The thorn , and the thistle grow broader and higher ;</l>
     <l n="11">The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags ;</l>
     <l n="12">And his money still wastes , till he starves or he begs .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">I made him a visit , still hoping to find</l>
     <l n="14">He had took better care for improving his mind :</l>
     <l n="15">He told me his dreams , talk 'd of eating and drinking ;</l>
     <l n="16">But he scarce reads his Bible , and never loves thinking .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Said I then to my heart , ‘ Here 's a lesson for me !</l>
     <l n="18">That man 's but a picture of what I might be ;</l>
     <l n="19">But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who have taught me by times to love working and reading ! ’</l>

    <head>THE ANT , OR EMMET .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">These Emmets , how little they are in our eyes !</l>
     <l n="2">We tread them to dust , and a troop of them dies ,</l>
     <l n="3">Without our regard or concern :</l>
     <l n="4">Yet , as wise as we are , if we went to their school ,</l>
     <l n="5">There 's many a sluggard and many a fool</l>

     <l n="7">They wear not their time out in sleeping or play ,</l>
     <l n="8">But gather up corn in a sunshiny day ,</l>
     <l n="9">And for winter they lay up their stores :</l>

     <l n="11">One would think they foresaw all the frosts and the storms ,</l>
     <l n="12">And so brought their food within doors .</l>

     <l n="13">But I have less sense than a poor creeping Ant ,</l>
     <l n="14">If I take not due care for the things I shall want ,</l>
     <l n="15">Nor provide against dangers in time :</l>
     <l n="16">When death or old age shall once stare in my face ,</l>
     <l n="17">What a wretch shall I be in the end of my days ,</l>
     <l n="18">If I trifle away all their prime !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Now , now , while my strength and my youth are in bloom ,</l>
     <l n="20">Let me think what shall serve me when sickness shall come ,</l>
     <l n="21">And pray that my sins be forgiven .</l>
     <l n="22">Let me read in good books , and believe , and obey ;</l>
     <l n="23">That , when death turns me out of this cottage of clay ,</l>

     <l n="3">With fleeces so clean and so white ;</l>
     <l n="4">Or a nest of young doves in a large open cage</l>

     <l n="7">If we had been ducks , we might dabble in mud ;</l>
     <l n="8">Or dogs , we might play till it ended in blood :</l>
     <l n="9">So foul and so fierce are their natures ;</l>
     <l n="10">But Thomas and William , and such pretty names ,</l>

     <l n="13">Not a thing that we do , nor a word that we say ,</l>
     <l n="14">Should injure another in jesting or play ,</l>

     <l n="16">How rude are the boys that throw pebbles and mire ;</l>
     <l n="17">There 's none but a madman will fling about fire ,</l>
