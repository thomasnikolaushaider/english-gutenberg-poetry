    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="2">Henry More ( 1614-1687 ) , the most interesting member of that group traditionally known as the Cambridge Platonists , lived conscientiously and well . Having early set out on one course , he never thought to change it ; he devoted his whole life to the joy of celebrating , again and again , “ a firm and unshaken Belief of the Existence of GOD . . . , a God infinitely Good , as well as infinitely Great . . . .”[ 1 ] Such faith was for More the starting point of his rational understanding : “ with the most fervent Prayers ” he beseeched God , in his autobiographical “ Praefatio Generalissima ,” “ to set me free from the dark Chains , and this so sordid Captivity of my own Will .” More offered to faith all which his reason could know , and so it happened that he “ was got into a most Joyous and Lucid State of Mind ,” something quite ineffable ; to preserve these “ Sensations and Experiences of my own Soul ,” he wrote “ a pretty full Poem call ’ d Psychozoia ” ( or A Christiano-Platonicall display of Life ) , an exercise begun about 1640 and designed for no audience but himself . There were times , More continued in his autobiographical remarks , when he thought of destroying Psychozoia because its style is rough and its language filled with archaisms . His principal purpose in that poem was to demonstrate in detail the spiritual foundation of all existence ; Psyche , his heroine , is the daughter of the Absolute , the general Soul who holds together the metaphysical universe , against whom he sees reflected his own soul ’ s mystical progress . More must , nevertheless , have been pleased with his labor , for he next wrote Psychathanasia Platonica : or Platonicall Poem of the Immortality of Souls , especially Mans Soul , in which he attempts to demonstrate the immortality of the soul as a corrective to his age . Then , he joined to that Antipsychopannychia , or A Confutation of the sleep of the Soul after death , and Antimonopsychia , or That all Souls are not one ; at the urging of friends , he published the poems in 1642 — his first literary work — as Psychodia Platonica .</p>
    <p n="3">In his argument for the soul ’ s immortality toward the end of Psychathanasia ( III. 4 ) , More had urged that there was no need to plead for any extension of the infinite (“ a contradiction ,” and also , it would seem , a fruitless inquiry ) ; but he soon changed his mind . The preface to Democritus Platonissans reproduces those stanzas of the earlier poem which deny infinity ( 34 to the end of the canto ) with a new ( formerly concluding ) stanza 39 and three further stanzas “ for a more easie and naturall leading to the present Canto ,” i. e ., Democritus Platonissans , which More clearly intended to be an addition , a fifth canto to Psychathanasia ( Book III ) ; and although Democritus Platonissans first appeared separately , More appended it to Psychathanasia in the second edition of his collected poems , this time with English titles , the whole being called A Platonick Song of the Soul ( 1647 ) .</p>
    <p n="4">There is little relationship between Democritus Platonissans and the rest of More ’ s poetry ; even the main work to which it supposedly forms a final and conclusive canto provides only the slightest excuse for such a continuation . Certainly , in Psychathanasia , More is excited by the new astronomy ; he praises the Copernican system throughout Book III , giving an account of it according to the lessons of his study of Galileo ’ s Dialogo , which he may have been reading even as he wrote .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Indeed , More tries to harmonize the two poems — his habit was always to look for unity . But even though Democritus Platonissans explores an astronomical subject , just as the third part of Psychathanasia also does , its attitude and theme are quite different ; for More had meanwhile been reading Descartes .</p>
    <p n="5">More ’ s theory of the infinity of worlds and God ’ s plenitude evidently owed a great deal to Descartes ’ recent example ; More responds exuberantly to him , especially to his Principes de la Philosophie ( 1644 ) ; for in him he fancied having found a true ally . Steeped in Platonic and neo-Platonic thought , and determined to reconcile Spirit with the rational mind of man , More thought he had discovered in Cartesian ‘ intuition ’ what was not necessarily there . Descartes had enjoyed an ecstatic illumination , and so had Plotinus ; but this was not enough , as More may have wanted to imagine , to make Descartes a neo-Platonist .<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>But the Platonic element implicit in Descartes , his theory of innate ideas , and his proof of the existence of God from the idea of God , all helped to make More so receptive to him . Nevertheless , More did not really need Descartes , nor , as he himself was later to discover , had he even understood him properly , for More had looked at him only to find his own reflection .</p>
    <p n="6">But there was nothing really new about the idea of infinite worlds which More described in Democritus Platonissans ; it surely was not a conception unique to Descartes . The theory was a common one in Greek and Renaissance thought . Democritus and the Epicureans , of course , advocated the theme of infinite worlds in an infinite universe which More accepted ; but at the same time , he rejected their view of a mechanistic and fortuitous creation . Although Plato specifically rejects the idea of infinite worlds ( in Timaeus ) , More imagines , as the title of his poem implies , a Platonic universe , by which he really means neo-Platonic , combined with a Democritean plurality of worlds . More filled space , not with the infinite void of the Atomists , but with the Divine , ever active immanence . More , in fact , in an early philosophic work , An Antidote against Atheisme ( 1652 ) , and again in Divine Dialogues ( 1668 ) , refutes Lucretius by asserting the usefulness of all created things in God ’ s Providence and the essential design in Nature . His reference in Democritus Platonissans ( st. 20 ) is typical : “ though I detest the sect / of Epicurus for their manners vile ,/ Yet what is true I may not well reject .” In bringing together Democritus ’ theories and neo-Platonic thought , More obviously has attempted reconciliation of two exclusive world views , but with dubious success .</p>
    <p n="7">While More stands firmly before a familiar tradition , his belief in an infinity of worlds evidently has little immediate connection with any predecessors . Even Bruno ’ s work , or Thomas Digges ,’ which could have occupied an important place , seems to have had little , if any , direct influence on More . It was Descartes who stimulated his thought at the most receptive moment : in 1642 to have denied a theory which in 1646 he proclaimed with such force evidently argues in favor of a most powerful attachment . More responded enthusiastically to what he deemed a congenial metaphysical system ; as a champion of Descartes , he was first to make him known in England and first in England to praise the infinity of worlds , yet Descartes ’ system could give to him little real solace . More embraces God ’ s plenitude and infinity of worlds , he rejoices in the variety and grandeur of the universe , and he worships it as he might God Himself ; but Descartes was fundamentally uninterested in such enthusiasms and found them even repellant — as well as unnecessary — to his thought . For More the doctrine of infinity was a proper corollary of Copernican astronomy and neo-Platonism ( as well as Cabbalistic mysticism ) and therefore a necessity to his whole elaborate and eclectic view of the world .</p>
    <p n="8">In introducing Cartesian thought into England , More emphasized particular physical doctrines mainly described in The Principles of Philosophy ; he shows little interest in the Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason ( 1637 ) , or in the Meditations ( 1641 ) , both of which were also available to him when he wrote Democritus Platonissans . In the preface to his poem , he refers to Descartes whom he seems to have read hopefully : surely “ infinitude ” is the same as the Cartesian “ indefinite .” “ For what is his = mundus indefinitè extensus =, but = extensus infinitè =? Else it sounds onely = infinitus quoad nos =, but = simpliciter finitus =,” for there can be no space “ unstuffd with Atoms .” More thinks that Descartes seems “ to mince it ,” that difficulty lies in the interpretation of a word , not in an essential idea . He is referring to Part II , xxi , of The Principles , but he quotes , with tacit approval , from Part III , i and ii , in the motto to the poem . More undoubtedly knows the specific discussion of ‘ infinity ’ in Part I , xxvi-xxviii , where he must first have felt uneasy delight on reading “ that it is not needful to enter into disputes regarding the infinite , but merely to hold all that in which we can find no limits as indefinite , such as the extension of the world . . . .”[ 4 ] More asked Descartes to clarify his language in their correspondence of 1648-49 , the last year of Descartes ’ life .</p>
    <p n="9">Democritus Platonissans is More ’ s earliest statement about absolute space and time ; by introducing these themes into English philosophy , he contributed significantly to the intellectual history of the seventeenth century . Newton , indeed , was able to make use of More ’ s forging efforts ; but of relative time or space and their measurement , which so much concerned Newton , More had little to say . He was preoccupied with the development of a theory which would show that immaterial substance , with space and time as attributes , is as real and as absolute as the Cartesian geometrical and spatial account of matter which he felt was true but much in need of amplification .</p>
    <p n="10">In his first letter to Descartes , of 11 December 1648 , More wrote : “. . . this indefinite extension is either simpliciter infinite , or only in respect to us . If you understand extension to be infinite simpliciter , why do you obscure your thought by too low and too modest words ? If it is infinite only in respect to us , extension , in reality , will be finite ; for our mind is the measure neither of the things nor of truth . . . .” Unsatisfied by his first answer from Descartes ( 5 February 1649 ) , he urges his point again ( 5 March ): if extension can describe matter , the same quality must apply to the immaterial and yet be only one of many attributes of Spirit . In his second letter to More ( 15 April ) , Descartes answers firmly : “ It is repugnant to my concept to attribute any limit to the world , and I have no other measure than my perception for what I have to assert or to deny . I say , therefore , that the world is indeterminate or indefinite , because I do not recognize in it any limits . But I dare not call it infinite as I perceive that God is greater than the world , not in respect to His extension , because , as I have already said , I do not acknowledge in God any proper [ extension ] , but in respect to His perfection . . . . It is repugnant to my mind . . . it implies a contradiction , that the world be finite or limited , because I cannot but conceive a space outside the boundaries of the world wherever I presuppose them .” More plainly fails to understand the basic dualism inherent in Cartesian philosophy and to sense the irrelevance of his questions . While Descartes is really disposing of the spiritual world in order to get on with his analysis of finite experience , More is keenly attempting to reconcile neo-Platonism with the lively claims of matter . His effort can be read as the brave attempt to harmonize an older mode of thought with the urgency of the ‘ new philosophy ’ which called the rest in doubt . More saw this conflict and the implications of it with a kind of clarity that other men of his age hardly possessed . But the way of Descartes , which at first seemed to him so promising , certainly did not lead to the kind of harmony which he sought .</p>
    <p n="11">More ’ s original enthusiasm for Descartes declined as he understood better that the Cartesian world in practice excluded spirits and souls . Because Descartes could find no necessary place even for God Himself , More styled him , in Enchiridion Metaphysicum ( 1671 ) , the “ Prince of the Nullibists ”; these men “ readily acknowledge there are such things as Incorporeal Beings or Spirits , yet do very peremptorily contend , that they are no where in the whole World [;] . . . because they so boldly affirm that a Spirit is Nullibi , that is to say , no where ,” they deserve to be called Nullibists .<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>In contrast to these false teachers , More describes absolute space by listing twenty epithets which can be applied either to God or to pure extension , such as “ Unum , Simplex , Immobile . . . Incomprehensible ”[ 6 ] There is , however , a great difficulty here ; for while Space and Spirit are eternal and uncreated , they yet contain material substance which has been created by God . If the material world possesses infinite extension , as More generally believes , that would preclude any need of its having a creator . In order to avoid this dilemma , which Democritus Platonissans ignores , More must at last separate matter and space , seeing the latter as an attribute of God through which He is able to contain a finite world limited in space as well as in time . In writing that “ this infinite space because of its infinity is distinct from matter ,”[ 7 ] More reveals the direction of his conclusion ; the dichotomy it embodies is Cartesianism in reverse .</p>
    <p n="12">While More always labored to describe the ineffable , his earliest work , the poetry , may have succeeded in this wish most of all . Although he felt that his poetry was aiming toward truths which his “ later and better concocted Prose ”[ 8 ] reached , the effort cost him the suggestiveness of figurative speech . In urging himself on toward an ever more consistent statement of belief , he lost much of his beginning exuberance ( best expressed in the brief “ Philosopher ’ s Devotion ”) and the joy of intellectual discovery . In the search “ to find out Words which will prove faithful witnesses of the peculiarities of my Thoughts ,” he staggers under the unsupportable burden of too many words . In trying so desperately to clarify his thought , he rejected poetic discourse as “ slight ”; only a language free of metaphor and symbol could , he supposed , lead toward correctness . Indeed , More soon renounced poetry ; he apparently wrote no more after collecting it in Philosophical Poems ( 1647 ) , when he gave up poetry for “ more seeming Substantial performances in solid Prose .”[ 9 ] “ Cupids Conflict ,” which is “ annexed ” to Democritus Platonissans , is an interesting revelation of the failure of poetry , as More felt it : he justifies his “ rude rugged uncouth style ” by suggesting that sweet verses avoid telling important truths ; harshness and obscurity may at least remind one that there is a significance beyond mere words . His lament is characteristic : “ How ill alas ! with wisdome it accords / To sell my living sense for liveless words .”</p>
    <p n="13">In spite of these downcast complaints , More was quite capable of lively and meaningful poetic ideas . One is the striking image of the cone which occurs in Democritus Platonissans ( especially in stanzas 7-8 , 66-67 , and 88 ) and becomes the most essential symbol to More ’ s expression of infinitude and extension . The figure first appears in Antipsychopannychia ( II. 9 ) where his purpose is to reconcile the world Soul with Christian eschatology . In Democritus Platonissans , the cone enables More to adapt the familiar Hermetic paradox :</p>
    <p n="14">A Circle whose circumference no where Is circumscrib ’ d , whose Centre ’ s each where set , But the low Cusp ’ s a figure circular , Whose compasse is ybound , but centre ’ s every where . ( st. 8 )</p>
    <p n="15">Every point on the circumference , or base of the cone , relates to the single point at the top . The world , More wants to say , has no limits , no center , yet there are bounds in its not having any . More recognizes the contradiction when he fancies “ some strong arm ’ d Archer ” at the wide world ’ s edge ( st. 37 ) . Where shall he send his shafts ? Into “ mere vacuity ”? But More hardly seems aware of the inappropriateness of the cone : he uses a geometrical figure to locate space , time , and numberless worlds within the universal sight of God , but matter is infinite , “ distinct / And yet proceeding from the Deitie ” ( st. 68 ) . Obviously , the archer must forever be sending his arrows through an infinitely expanding surface . Nevertheless , the cone has great value as a metaphor , as a richly suggestive and fascinating conception . More , however , does not want to speak metaphorically ; he is attempting to disclose truths , literal and plain , where pretty words and metaphors have no place . Even as he is writing his most effective poetry , we are aware that More is denying his poetic office ; for he is pleading a reasoned case where the words crack and strain , where poetic meaning gathers , only to be denied .</p>
    <p n="16">But these objections momentarily disappear when More forgets himself enough to let us feel his imagination and does not worry that we might miss the proofs of his philosophy . Democritus Platonissans concludes with an apocalyptic vision wherein the poet imagines the reconciliation of infinite worlds and time within God ’ s immensity . He is also attempting to harmonize Psychathanasia , where he rejected infinitude , with its sequel , Democritus Platonissans , where he has everywhere been declaring it ; thus we should think of endless worlds as we should think of Nature and the Phoenix , dying yet ever regenerative , sustained by a “ centrall power / Of hid spermatick life ” which sucks “ sweet heavenly juice ” from above ( st. 101 ) . More closes his poem on a vision of harmony and ceaseless energy , a most fit ending for one who dared to believe that the new philosophy sustained the old , that all coherence had not gone out of the world , but was always there , only waiting to be discovered afresh in this latter age .</p>

    <note xml:id="note1" place="bottom" n="1">The quotations from More ’ s Latin autobiography occur in the Opera Omnia ( London , 1675-79 ) , portions of which Richard Ward translated in The Life of . . . Henry More ( London , 1710 ) . Cf . the modern edition of this work , ed . M. F. Howard ( London , 1911 ) , pp . 61 , 67-68 , the text followed here . There is a recent reprint of the Opera Omnia in 3 volumes ( Hildesheim , 1966 ) with an introduction by Serge Hutin . The “ Praefatio Generalissima ” begins vol . II . 1 . One passage in it which Ward did not translate describes the genesis of Democritus Platonissans . More writes that after finishing Psychathanasia , he felt a change of heart : “ Postea vero mutata sententia furore nescio quo Poetico incitatus supra dictum Poema scripsi , ea potissimum innixus ratione quod liquido constaret extensionem spacii dari infinitam , nec majores absurditates pluresve contingere posse in Materia infinita , infinitaque ; Mundi duratione , quam in infinita Extensione spacii ” ( p. ix ) .</note>

    <p n="21">READER ,</p>
    <p n="22">If thou standest not to the judgement of thine eye more then of thy reason , this fragment may passe favourably , though in the neglectfull disguise of a fragment ; if the strangenesse of the argument prove no hinderance . INFINITIE of WORLDS ! A thing monstrous if assented to , and to be startled at , especially by them , whose thoughts this one have alwayes so engaged , that they can find no leisure to think of any thing else . But I onely make a bare proposall to more acute judgements , of what my sportfull fancie , with pleasure hath suggested : following my old designe of furnishing mens minds with varietie of apprehensions concerning the most weightie points of Philosophie , that they may not seem rashly to have settled in the truth , though it be the truth : a thing as ill beseeming Philosophers , as hastie prejudicative sentence Politicall Judges . But if I had relinquishd here my wonted self , in proving Dogmaticall , I should have found very noble Patronage for the cause among the ancients , = Epicurus =, = Democritus =, = Lucretius =, =&amp; c .= Or if justice may reach the dead , do them the right , as to shew , that though they be hooted at , by the Rout of the learned , as men of monstrous conceits , they were either very wise or exceeding fortunate to light on so probable and specious an opinion , in which notwithstanding there is so much difficultie and seeming inconsistencie .</p>
    <p n="23">Nay and that sublime and subtil Mechanick too , = DesChartes =, though he seem to mince it must hold infinitude of worlds , or which is as harsh one infinite one . For what is his = mundus indefinitè extensus =, but = extensus infinitè =? Else it sounds onely = infinitus quoad nos = but = simpliciter finitus =. But if any space be left out unstuffd with Atoms , it will hazard the dissipation of the whole frame of Nature into disjoynted dust . As may be proved by the Principles of his own Philosophie . And that there is space whereever God is , or any actuall and self-subsistent Being , seems to me no plainer then one of the κοιναί ἔννοιαι .</p>
    <p n="24">For mine own part I must confesse these apprehensions do plainly oppose what heretofore I have conceived ; but I have sworn more faithfull friendship with Truth then with myself . And therefore without all remorse lay batterie against mine own edifice : not sparing to shew how weak that is , that my self now deems not impregnably strong . I have at the latter end of the last Canto of = Psychathanasia =, not without triumph concluded , that the world hath not continued = ab æterno =, from this ground :</p>
    <p n="25">Extension That ’ s infinite implies a contradiction .</p>
    <p n="26">And this is in answer to an objection against my last argument of the souls Immortalitie , = viz .= divine goodnesse , which I there make the measure of his providence . That ground limits the essence of the world as well as its duration , and satisfies the curiositie of the Opposer , by shewing the incompossibilitie in the Creature , not want of goodnesse in the Creatour to have staid the framing of the Universe . But now roused up by a new Philosophick furie , I answer that difficultie by taking away the Hypothesis of either the world or time being finite : defending the infinitude of both , which though I had done with a great deal of vigour and life , and semblance of assent , it would have agreed well enough with the free beat of Poesie , and might have passed for a pleasant flourish : but the severitie of my own judgement , and sad Genius hath cast in many correctives and coolers into the Canto it self ; so that it cannot amount to more then a discussion . And discussion is no prejudice but an honour to the truth : for then and never but then is she Victorious . And what a glorious Trophee shall the finite world erect when it hath vanquished the Infinite ; a Pygmee a Giant .</p>
    <p n="27">For the better understanding of the connexion of this Appendix , with the Poem of the souls Immortalitie ; I have taken off the last stanza ’ s thereof , and added some few new ones to them for a more easie and naturall leading to the present Canto . = Psychathan . lib . 3 . Cant . 4 .=</p>
    <p n="28">Stanz . 33d .</p>
    <p n="29">But thou who ere thou art that thus dost strive With fierce assault my groundwork to subvert , And boldly dost into Gods secrets dive , Base fear my manly face note make m ’ avert . In that odde question which thou first didst stert , I ’ ll plainly prove thine incapacitie , And force thy feeble feet back to revert , That cannot climb so high a mysterie , I ’ le shew thee strange perplexed inconsistencie .</p>
    <p n="30">34</p>
    <p n="31">Why was this world from all infinitie Not made ? say ’ st thou : why ? could it be so made Say I . For well observe the sequencie : If this Out-world continually hath wade Through a long long-spun-time that never had Beginning , then there as few circulings Have been in the quick Moon as Saturn sad ; And still more plainly this clear truth to sing , As many years as dayes or flitting houres have been .</p>
    <p n="32">35</p>
    <p n="33">For things that we conceive are infinite , One th ’ other no ’ te surpasse in quantitie . So I have prov ’ d with clear convincing light , This world could never from infinitie Been made . Certain deficiencie Doth alwayes follow evolution : Nought ’ s infinite but tight eternitie Close thrust into itself : extension That ’ s infinite implies a contradiction .</p>
    <p n="34">36</p>
    <p n="35">So then for ought we know this world was made So soon as such a Nature could exist ; And though that it continue , never fade , Yet never will it be that that long twist Of time prove infinite , though ner ’ e desist From running still . But we may safely say Time past compar ’ d with this long future list Doth show as if the world but yesterday Were made , and in due time Gods glory out may ray .</p>
    <p n="36">37</p>
    <p n="37">Then this short night and ignorant dull ages Will quite be swallowed in oblivion ; And though this hope by many surly Sages Be now derided , yet they ’ ll all be gone In a short time , like Bats and Owls yflone At dayes approch . This will hap certainly At this worlds shining conflagration . Fayes , Satyrs , Goblins the night merrily May spend , but ruddy Sol shall make them all to flie .</p>
    <p n="38">38</p>
    <p n="39">The roaring Lions and drad beasts of prey Rule in the dark with pitious crueltie ; But harmlesse Man is matter of the day , Which doth his work in pure simplicitie . God blesse his honest usefull industrie . But pride and covetize , ambition , Riot , revenge , self-love , hypocrisie , Contempt of goodnesse , forc ’ d opinion ; These and such like do breed the worlds confusion .</p>
    <p n="40">39</p>
    <p n="41">But sooth to say though my triumphant Muse Seemeth to vant as in got victorie , And with puissant stroke the head to bruize Of her stiff so , and daze his phantasie , Captive his reason , dead each facultie : Yet in her self so strong a force withstands That of her self afraid , she ’ ll not aby , Nor keep the field . She ’ ll fall by her own hand As Ajax once laid Ajax dead upon the strand .</p>
    <p n="42">40</p>
    <p n="43">For thus her-self by her own self ’ s oppos ’ d ; The Heavens the Earth the universall Frame Of living Nature God so soon disclos ’ d As He could do , or she receive the same . All times delay since that must turn to blame , And what cannot He do that can be done ? And what might let but by th ’ all-powerfull Name Or Word of God , the Worlds Creation More suddenly were made then mans swift thought can run ?</p>
    <p n="44">41</p>
    <p n="45">Wherefore that Heavenly Power or is as young As this Worlds date ; or else some needlesse space Of time was spent , before the Earth did clung So close unto her-self and seas embrace Her hollow breast , and if that time surpasse A finite number then Infinitie Of years before this Worlds Creation passe . So that the durance of the Deitie We must contract or strait his full Benignitie .</p>
    <p n="46">42</p>
    <p n="47">But for the cradle of the Cretian Jove , And guardians of his vagient Infancie What sober man but sagely will reprove ? Or drown the noise of the fond Dactyli By laughter loud ? Dated Divinitie Certes is but the dream of a drie brain : God maim ’ d in goodnesse , inconsistencie ; Wherefore my troubled mind is now in pain Of a new birth , which this one Canto ’ ll not contain .</p>
    <p n="48">Now Reader , thou art arrived to the Canto it self , from which I have kept thee off by too tedious Preface and Apologie , which is seldome made without consciousnesse of some fault , which I professe I find not in my self , unlesse this be it , that I am more tender of thy satisfaction then mine own credit . As for that high sullen Poem , = Cupids Conflict =, I must leave it to thy candour and favourable censure . The = Philosophers Devotion = I cast in onely , that the latter pages should not be unfurnished .</p>

    <p>are radiant ab intimo and awake into this or the other operation , by the powerfull appulse of some superadvenient form . That which change of Phantasmes is to the soul , that is alteration of rayes to them . For their rayes are ab intrinseco , as the phantasmes of the soul . These be the reall matter of which all supposed bodies are compounded , and this matter ( as I said ) is form and life , so that all is life and form what ever is in the world , as I have somewhere intimated in Antipsychopan : But however I use the terme body ordinarily in the usuall and vulgar acception . And for that sense of the ancients , nearest to which I have defined it in the place first above mentioned , that I seem not to choose that same as most easie to proceed against in disproving the corporeity of the soul , the arguments do as necessarily conclude against such a naturall body as is ordinarily described in Physiologie ( as you may plainly discern if you list to observe ) as also against this body composed of the Cuspidall particles of the Cone . For though they be Centrall lives , yet are they neither Plasticall , Sensitive , or Rationall , so farre are they from proving to be the humane soul whose nature is there discust . C Cone : Is a solid figure made by the turning of a rectangular triangle , about ; one of the sides that include the right angle resting , which will be then the Axis of the compleated Cone . But I take it sometimes for the comprehension of all things , God himself not left out , whom I tearm the Basis of the Cone or Universe . And because all from him descends , καθ ’ ὑποστολῆν , with abatement or contraction , I give the name of Cone to the Universe . And of Cone rather then Pyramid because of the roundnesse of the figure , which the effluxes of all things imitate . Chaos , } Chronicall , } See interpret · Gen. Clare , } Circulation , The terme is taken from a toyish observation , viz . the circling of water when a stone is cast into a standing pool . The motion drives on circularly , the first rings are thickest , but the further they go they grow the thinner , till they vanish into nothing . Such is the diffusion of the species audible in the strucken aire , as also of the visible species . In brief any thing is said to circulate that diffuseth its image or species in a round . It might have been more significantly called orbiculation ; seeing this circumfusion makes not onely a circle , but fills a sphere , which may be called the sphere of activity . Yet Circulation more fitly sets out the diminution of activity , from those ringes in the water which as they grow in compasse , abate in force and thicknesse . But sometimes I use Circulate in an ordinary sense to turn round , or return in a circle . Centre , Centrall , Centrality . When they are used out of their ordinary sense , they signifie the depth or inmost being of any thing , from whence its acts and energies flow forth . See Atom-lives . Cuspis of the Cone . The multiplide Cuspis of the Cone is nothing but the last projection of life from Psyche , which is ש ׁ מים a liquid fire or fire and water , which are the corporeall or materiall principles of all things , changed or disgregated ( if they be centrally distinguishable ) and again mingled by the virtue of Physis or Spermaticall life of the world ; of these are the Sunne and all the Planets , they being kned together , and fixt by the Centrall power of each Planet and Sunne . The volatile Ether is also of the same , and all the bodies of plants , beasts and men . These are they which we handle and touch , a sufficient number compact together . For neither is the noise of those little flies in a summer-evening audible severally : but a full Quire of them strike the ear with a pretty kind of buzzing . Strong and tumultuous pleasure and scorching pain reside in these , they being essentiall and centrall , but sight and hearing are onely of the images of these , See Body . Eternitie . Is the steddie comprehension of all things at once . See Æon discribed in my Expos . upon Psychozoia . Energie . It is a peculiar Platonicall terme . In my Interpret . Gen . I expounded it Operation , Efflux , Activity . None of those words bear the full sense of it . The examples there are fit , viz . the light of the Sunne , the phantasms of the soul . We may collect the genuine sense of the word by comparing severall places in the Philosopher . Ἔχει γὰρ ἕκαστον τῶν ὄντων ἐνεργειαν , ἥ ἐστιν ὁμοίωμα αὐτοῦ , ὥστε αὐτοῦ ὄντος , κἀκεῖνο εἶναι , καὶ μένοντος φθάνειν εἰς τὸ πόῤῥω , τὸ μὲν ἐπὶ πλέον , τὸ δὲ εἰς ἔλαττον . Καὶ αἱ μὲν ἀσθενεῖς καὶ ἀμυδραὶ , αἱ δὲ καὶ λανθάνουσαι , τῶν δ ’ εἰσὶ μείζους καὶ εἰς τὸ πόῤῥω . For every being hath its Energie , which is the image of it self , so that it existing that Energie doth also exist , and standing still is projected forward more or lesse . And some of those energies are weak and obscure , others hid or undiscernable , othersome greater and of a larger projection . Plotin . Ennead . 4. lib . 5. cap . 7 . And again , Ennead . 3. lib . 4 . Καὶ μένομεν τῷ μὲν νοητῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἄνω · τῷ δὲ ἐσχάτῳ αὐτοῦ , πεπεδήμεθα τῷ κάτω , οἷον ἀπόῤῥοιαν ἀπ ’ ἐκείνου διδόντες εἰς τὸ κάτω , μᾶλλον δὲ ἐνέργειαν , ἐκείνου οὐκ ἐλαττουμένου . And we remain above by the Intellectuall man , but by the extreme part of him we are held below , as it were yielding an efflux from him to that which is below , or rather an energie he being not at all lessened . This curiositie Antoninus also observes , ( lib . 8 . Meditat . ) in the nature of the sun-beams , where although he admits of χύσις , yet he doth not of ἀπόῤῥοια which is ἔκχυσις . Ὁ ἥλιος κατακεχύσθαι δοκεῖ , καὶ πάντῇ γε κέχυται οὐ μὴν ἐκκέχυται . ἡ γὰρ χύσις αὐτοῦ τάσις ἐστίν . ἀκτῖνες γοῦν αἱ αὐγαὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐκτείνεσθαι λέγονται . The sunne , saith he , is diffused , and his fusion is every where but without effusion , &amp; c. I will onely adde one place more out of Plotinus . Ennead . 3. lib . 6 . Ἑκάστου δὲ μορίου ἡ ἐνέργεια ἡ κατὰ φύσιν ζωὴ οὐκ ἐξιστᾶσα . The naturall energie of each power of the soul is life not parted from the soul though gone out of the soul , = viz .= into act . Comparing of all these places together , I cannot better explain this Platonick term , energie , then by calling it the rayes of an essence , or the beams of a vitall Centre . For essence is the Centre as it were of that which is truly called Energie , and Energie the beams and rayes of an essence . And as the Radii of a circle leave not the centre by touching the Circumference , no more doth that which is the pure Energie of an essence , leave the essence by being called out into act , but is ἐν-έργεια a working in the essence though it flow out into act . So that Energie depends alwayes on essence , as Lumen on Lux , or the creature on God ; Whom therefore Synesius in his Hymnes calls the Centre of all things . Entelecheia . See Interpret . Gen. F Faith . Platonick faith in the first Good . This faith is excellently described in Proclus , where it is set above all ratiocination , nay , Intellect it self . Πρὸς δὲ αὖ τὸ ἀγαθὸν οὐ γνώσεως ἔτι καὶ συνεργείας δεῖ τοῖς συναφθῆναι σπεύδουσιν , ἀλλ ’ ἱδρύσεως καὶ μονίμου καταστάσεως καὶ ἠρεμίας . But to them that endeavour to be joyned with the first Good , there is no need of knowledge or multifarious cooperation , but settlednesse , steddinesse , and rest . lib . 1. cap . 24 . Theolog . Platon . And in the next chapter ; Δεῖ γὰρ οὐ γνωστικῶς οὐδ ’ ἀτελῶς τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐπιζητεῖν , ἀλλ ’ ἐπιδόντας ἑαυτοὺς τῷ θείῳ φωτὶ καὶ μύσαντας , οὕτως ἐνιδρύεσθαι τῇ ἀγνώστῳ καὶ κρυφίῳ τῶν ὄντων ἑνάδι . For we must not seek after that absolute or first Good cognoscitively or imperfectly , but giving our selves up to the divine light , and winking ( that is shutting our eyes of reason and understanding ) so to place our selves steddily in that hidden Unitie of all things . After he preferres this faith before the clear and present assent to the κοιναὶ ἔννοιαι , yea and the νοερὰ ἁπλότης , so that he will not that any intellectuall operation should come in comparison with it . Πολυειδὴς γὰρ αἵτη καὶ δι ’ ἑτερότητος χωριζομένη τῶν νοουμένων , καὶ ὅλως κίνησίς ἐστι νοερὰ περὶ τὸ νοητόν . Δεῖ δὲ τὴν θείαν πίστιν ἑνοειδῆ καὶ ἤρεμον ὑπάρχειν ἐν τῷ τῆς ἀγαθότητος ὁρμῷ τελείως ἱδρυθεῖσαν . For the operation of the Intellect is multiform and by diversitie separate from her objects , and is in a word , intellectuall motion about the object intelligible . But the divine faith must be simple and uniform , quiet and steddily resting in the haven of Goodnesse . And at last he summarily concludes , Ἐστί οὖν οὗτος ὅρμος ἀσφαλὴς τῶν ὄντων ἁπάντων . See Procl . Theolog . Platonick . lib . 1. cap . 25 . H Hyle . See Interpret . Gen . I Intellect . Sometimes it is to be interpreted Soul . Sometime the intellectuall facultie of the soul . Sometimes Intellect is an absolute essence shining into the soul : whose nature is this . A substance purely immateriall , impeccable , actually omniform , or comprehending all things at once , which the soul doth also being perfectly joyned with the Intellect . Ἔχομεν οὖν καὶ τὰ εἴδη διχῶς , ἐν μὲν ψυχῇ οἷον μὲν ἀνειλιγμένα καὶ οἷον κεχωρισμένα , ἐν δὲ τῷ νῷ ὁμοῦ τὰ πάντα . Plot . Ennead . 1. lib . 1. cap . 8 . Ideas , or Idees . Sometimes they are forms in the Intellectuall world . viz . in Æon , or On , other sometimes , phantasmes or representations in the soul . Innate Idees are the souls nature it self , her uniform essence , able by her Fire to produce this or that phantasme into act . Idiopathy . } See Interpret . Gen. Iao } L Logos . See Interpret . Gen. Life . The vitall operation of any soul . Sometime it is the soul it self , be it sensitive , vegetative , or rationall . Lower man . The lower man is our enquickned body , into which our soul comes , it being fitly prepared for the receiving of such a guest . The manner of the production of souls , or rather their non-production is admirably well set down in Plotinus , See , Ennead . 6. lib . 4. cap . 14 , 15 . M Monad . See Interpr . Gen. Mundane . Mundane spirit , Is that which is the spirit of the world or Universe . I mean by it not an intellectuall spirit , but a fine , unfixt , attenuate , subtill , ethereall substance , the immediate vehicle of plasticall or sensitive life . Memory . Mundane memory . Is that memory that is seated in the Mundane spirit of man , by a strong impression , or inustion of any phantasme , or outward sensible object , upon that spirit . But there is a Memory more subtill and abstract in the soul it self , without the help of this spirit , which she also carries away with her having left the body . Magicall . That is , attractive , or commanding by force of sympathy with the life of this naturall world . Moment . Sometimes signifies an instant , as indivisible , as κίνημα , which in motion answers to an instant in time , or a point in a line , Aristot . Phys . In this sense I use it , Psychathan . lib . 3. cant . 2. stanz . 16 ; But in a moment sol doth ray . But Cant . the 3 . Stanz . 45. v. 2 . I understand , as also doth Lansbergius , by a moment one second of a minute . In Antipsych . Cant . 2 . Stanz . the 20. v. 2. by a moment I understand a minute , or indefinitely any small time . O Orb . Orb Intellectuall , is nothing else but Æon or the Intellectuall world . The Orbs generall mentioned Psycathan . lib . 1. cant . 3. stanz . 23. v. 2 . I understand by them but so many universall orders of beings , if I may so terme them all ; for Hyle hath little or nothing of being . Omniformity . The omniformity of the soul is the having in her nature all forms , latent at least , and power of awaking them into act , upon occasion . Out-world . and Out-Heaven . The sensible world , the visible Heaven . P Perigee , } Psychicall , } Pareties , } See Interpret . Gen. Parallax , } Protopathy . } Parturient . See , Vaticinant . Phantasie . Lower phantasie , is that which resides in the Mundane spirit of a man , See Memory . Q Quantitative . Forms quantitative , are such sensible energies as arise from the complexion of many natures together , at whose discretion they vanish . That ’ s the seventh Orb of things , though broken and not filling all as the other do . But if you take it for the whole sensible world , it is entire , and is the same that Tasis in Psycozoia . But the centre of Tasis , viz . the multiplication of the reall Cuspis of the Cone ( for Hyle that is set for the most contract point of the Cuspis is scarce to be reckoned among realities ) that immense diffusion of atoms , is to be referred to Psyche , as an internall vegetative act , and so belongs to Physis the lowest order of life . For as that warmth that the sense doth afford the body , is not rationall , sensitive , or imaginative , but vegetative ; So this , ש ׁ מים i. e . liquid fire , which Psyche sends out , and is the outmost , last , and lowest operation from her self , is also vegetative . R Rhomboides . See Interpr . general . Reason . I understand by Reason , the deduction of one thing from another , which I conceive proceeds from a kind of continuitie of phantasmes : and is something like the moving of a cord at one end ; the parts next it rise with it . And by this concatenation of phantasmes I conceive , that both brutes and men are moved in reasonable wayes and methods in their ordinary externall actions . Rayes . The rayes of an essence is its energie . See Energie . Reduplicative . That is reduplicative , which is not onely in this point , but also in another , having a kind of circumscribed ubiquitie , viz . in its own sphear . And this is either by being in that sphear omnipresent it self , as the soul is said to be in the body tota in toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte , or else at least by propagation of rayes , which is the image of it self ; and so are divers sensible objects Reduplicative , as light , colours , sounds . And I make account either of these wayes justly denominate any thing spirituall . Though the former is most properly , at least more eminently spirituall . And whether any thing be after that way spirituall saving the Divinitie , there is reason to doubt . For what is entirely omnipresent in a sphear , whose diametre is but three feet , I see not , why ( that in the circumference being as fresh and entire as that in the centre ) it should stop there and not proceed even in infinitum , if the circumference be still as fresh and entire as the centre . But I define nothing . S Spermaticall . It belongs properly to Plants , but is transferred also to the Plasticall power in Animalls , I enlarge it to all magnetick power whatsoever that doth immediately rule and actuate any body . For all magnetick power is founded in Physis , and in reference to her , this world is but one great Plant , ( one λόγος σπερματικός giving it shape and corporeall life ) as in reference to Psyche , one happy and holy Animall . Spirit . Sometimes it signifieth the soul , othersometime , the naturall spirits in a mans body , which are Vinculum animæ &amp; corporis , and the souls vehicle : Sometimes life . See Reduplicative . Soul . When I speak of mans Soul , I understand that which Moses saith was inspired into the body , ( fitted out and made of earth ) by God , Genes . 2. which is not that impeccable spirit that cannot sinne ; but the very same that the Platonists call ψυχή , a middle essence betwixt that which they call νοῦς ( and we would in the Christian language call πνεῦμα ) and the life of the body which is εἴδωλον ψυχῆς , a kind of an umbratil vitalitie , that the soul imparts to the bodie in the enlivening of it : That and the body together , we Christians would call σὰρξ , and the suggestions of it , especially in its corrupt estate , φρόνημα σαρκός . And that which God inspired into Adam was no more then ψυχὴ , the soul , not the spirit , though it be called נשמת חיים Spiraculum vitæ ; is plain out of the text ; because it made man but become a living soul , נפש חיה . But you will say , he was a dead soul before , and this was the spirit of life , yea the spirit of God , the life of the soul that was breathed into him . But if חיה implie such a life and spirit , you must acknowledge the same to be also in the most stupid of all living creatures , even the fishes ( whose soul is but as salt to keep them from stinking , as Philo speaks ) for they are said to be נשמת חיים chap . 1. v. 20 . 21 . See 1 Cor . chap . 15 , v. 45 , 46 . In brief therefore , that which in Platonisme is νοῦς , is in Scripture πνεῦμα ; what σὰρξ in one , τὸ θηρίον , the brute or beast in the other , ψυχὴ the same in both . Self-reduplicative . See Reduplicative . T Tricentreitie . Centre is put for essence , so Tricentreitie must implie a trinitie of essence . See Centre , and Energie . V Vaticinant . The soul is said to be in a vaticinant or parturient condition , when she hath some kind of sense and hovering knowledge of a thing , but yet cannot distinctly and fully , and commandingly represent it to her self , cannot plainly apprehend , much lesse comprehend the matter . The phrase is borrowed of Proclus , who describing the incomprehensiblenese of God , and the desire of all things towards him , speaks thus ; Ἄγνωστον γὰρ ὂν ποθεῖ τὰ ὄντα τὸ ἐφετὸν τοῦτο καὶ ἄληπτον , μήτε οῦν γνῶναι μήτε ἑλεῖν ὁ ποθεῖ , δυνάμενα , περὶ αὐτὸ πάντα χορεύει καὶ ὠδίνει μὲν αὐτὸ καὶ οἷον ἀπομαντεύεται . Theolog . Platon . lib . 1. cap . 21 . See Psychathan . lib . 3. cant . 3. stanz . 12 . &amp; 14 . The Philosophers Devotion . Sing aloud his praise rehearse Who hath made the Universe . He the boundlesse Heavens has spread All the vitall Orbs has kned ; He that on Olympus high Tends his flocks with watchfull eye , And this eye has multiplide Midst each flock for so reside . Thus as round about they stray Toucheth each with out-stretch ’ d ray , Nimbly they hold on their way , Shaping out their Night and Day . Never slack they ; none respires , Dancing round their Centrall fires . In due order as they move Echo ’ s sweet be gently drove Thorough Heavens vast Hollownesse , Which unto all corners presse : Musick that the heart of Jove Moves to joy and sportfull love ; Fills the listning saylers eares Riding on the wandering Sphears . Neither Speech nor Language is Where their voice is not transmisse . God is Good , is Wise , is Strong , Witnesse all the creature-throng , Is confess ’ d by every Tongue . All things back from whence they sprong , As the thankfull Rivers pay What they borrowed of the Sea . Now my self I do resigne , Take me whole I all am thine . Save me , God ! from Self-desire , Deaths pit , dark Hells raging fire , Envy , Hatred , Vengeance , Ire . Let not Lust my soul bemire . Quit from these thy praise I ’ ll sing , Loudly sweep the trembling string . Bear a part , O Wisdomes sonnes ! Free ’ d from vain Relligions . Lo ! from farre I you salute , Sweetly warbling on my Lute . Indie , Egypt , Arabie , Asia , Greece , and Tartarie , Carmel-tracts , and Lebanon With the Mountains of the Moon , from whence muddie Nile doth runne , Or whereever else you won ; Breathing in one vitall aire , One we are though distant farre . Rise at once lett ’ s sacrifice Odours sweet perfume the skies . See how Heavenly lightning fires Hearts inflam ’ d with high aspires ! All the substance of our souls Up in clouds of Incense rolls . Leave we nothing to our selves Save a voice , what need we els ! Or an hand to wear and tire On the thankfull Lute or Lyre . Sing aloud his praise rehearse Who hath made the Universe .</p>
