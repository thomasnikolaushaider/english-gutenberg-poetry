   <lg>
     <l n="2">Jean de La Fontaine was born on the 8th of July , 1621 , at Chateau-</l>
     <l n="3">Thierry , and his family held a respectable position there .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His education was neglected , but he had received that genius which makes amends for all . While still young the tedium of society led him into retirement , from which a taste for independence afterwards withdrew him .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He had reached the age of twenty-two , when a few sounds from the lyre of</l>
     <l n="2">Malherbe , heard by accident , awoke in him the muse which slept .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He soon became acquainted with the best models : Pheedrus , Virgil , Horace and Terence amongst the Latins ; Plutarch , Homer and Plato , amongst the Greeks ; Rabelais , Marot and d'Urfe , amongst the French ; Tasso , Ariosto and Boccaccio , amongst the Italians .</p>
   <p>He married , in compliance with the wishes of his family , a beautiful , witty and chaste woman , who drove him to despair .</p>
   <p>He was sought after and cherished by all distinguished men of letters . But it was two Ladies who kept him from experiencing the pangs of poverty .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine , if there remain anything of thee , and if it be permitted to thee for a moment to soar above all time ; see the names of La Sabliere and of Hervard pass with thine to the ages to come !</p>
   <p>The life of La Fontaine was , so to speak , only one of continual distraction . In the midst of society , he was absent from it . Regarded almost as an imbecile by the crowd , this clever author , this amiable man , only permitted himself to be seen at intervals and by friends .</p>
   <p>He had few books and few friends .</p>
   <p>Amongst a large number of works that he has left , everyone knows his fables and his tales , and the circumstances of his life are written in a hundred places .</p>
   <p>He died on the 16th of March , 1695 .</p>
   <p>Let us keep silence about his last moments , for fear of irritating those who never forgive .</p>
   <p>His fellow-citizens honour him in his posterity to this day .</p>
   <p>Long after his death , foreigners went to visit the room which he had occupied .</p>
   <p>Once a year , I shall go to visit his tomb .</p>
   <p>On that day , I shall tear up a fable of La Mothe , a tale of Vergier , or several of the best pages of Grecourt .</p>
   <p>He was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Joseph , by the side of Moliere .</p>
   <p>That spot will always be held sacred by poets and people of taste .</p>
   <p>THE AUTHOR 'S PREFACE</p>
   <p>TO THE FIRST VOLUME OF THESE TALES</p>
   <p>I had resolved not to consent to the printing of these Tales , until after I had joined to them those of Boccaccio , which are those most to my taste ; but several persons have advised me to produce at once what I have remaining of these trifles , in order to prevent from cooling the curiosity to see them , which is still in its first ardour . I gave way to this advice without much difficulty , and I have thought well to profit by the occasion . Not only is that permitted me , but it would be vanity on my part to despise such an advantage . It has sufficed me to wish that no one should be imposed upon in my favour , and to follow a road contrary to that of certain persons , who only make friends in order to gain voices in their favour by their means ; creatures of the Cabal , very different from that Spaniard who prided himself on being the son of his own works . Although I may still be as much in want of these artifices as any other person , I cannot bring myself to resolve to employ them ; however I shall accommodate myself if possible to the taste of the times , instructed as I am by my own experience , that there is nothing which is more necessary . Indeed one cannot say that all seasons are suitable for all classes of books . We have seen the Roundelays , the Metamorphoses , the Crambos , reign one after another . At present , these gallantries are out of date and nobody cares about them : so certain is it that what pleases at one time may not please at another ! It only belongs to works of truly solid merit and sovereign beauty , to be well received by all minds and in all ages , without possessing any other passport than the sole merit with which they are filled . As mine are so far distant from such a high degree of perfection , prudence advises that I should keep them in my cabinet unless I choose well my own time for producing them . This is what I have done , or what I have tried to do in this edition , in which I have only added new Tales , because it seemed to me that people were prepared to take pleasure in them . There are some which I have extended , and others which I have abridged , only for the sake of diversifying them and making them less tedious . But I am occupying myself over matters about which perhaps people will take no notice , whilst I have reason to apprehend much more important objections . There are only two principal ones which can be made against me ; the one that this book is licentious ; the other that it does not sufficiently spare the fair sex . With regard to the first , I say boldly that the nature of what is understood as a tale decided that it should be so , it being an indispensable law according to Horace , or rather according to reason and common sense , that one must conform one 's self to the nature of the things about which one writes . Now , that I should be permitted to write about these as so many others have done and with success I do not believe it can be doubted ; and people cannot condemn me for so doing , without also condemning Ariosto before me and the Ancients before Ariosto . It may be said that I should have done better to have suppressed certain details , or at least to have disguised them . Nothing was more easy , but it would have weakened the tale and taken away some of its charm : So much circumspection is only necessary in works which promise great discretion from the beginning , either by their subject or by the manner in which they are treated . I confess that it is necessary to keep within certain limits , and that the narrowest are the best ; also it must be allowed me that to be too scrupulous would spoil all . He who would wish to reduce Boccaccio to the same modesty as Virgil , would assuredly produce nothing worth having , and would sin against the laws of propriety by setting himself the task to observe them . For in order that one may not make a mistake in matters of verse and prose , extreme modesty and propriety are two very different things . Cicero makes the latter consist in saying what is appropriate one should say , considering the place , the time , and the persons to whom one is speaking . This principle once admitted , it is not a fault of judgment to entertain the people of to-day with Tales which are a little broad . Neither do I sin in that against morality . If there is anything in our writings which is capable of making an impression on the mind , it is by no means the gaiety of these Tales ; it passes off lightly ; I should rather fear a tranquil melancholy , into which the most chaste and modest novels are very capable of plunging us , and which is a great preparation for love . As to the second objection , by which people reproach me that this book does wrong to womankind , they would be right if I were speaking seriously : but who does not see that this is all in jest , and consequently cannot injure ? We must not be afraid on that account that marriages in the future will be less frequent , and husbands more on their guard . It may still be objected that these Tales are unfounded or that they have everywhere a foundation easy to destroy ; in short that they are absurdities and have not the least tinge of probability . I reply in a few words that I have my authorities : and besides it is neither truth nor probability which makes the beauty and the charm of these Tales : it is only the manner of telling them . These are the principal points on which I have thought it necessary to defend myself . I abandon the rest to the censors ; the more so as it would be an infinite undertaking to pretend to reply to all . Criticism never stops short nor ever wants for subjects on which to exercise itself : even if those I am able to foresee were taken from it , it would soon have discovered others .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IN Lombardy 's fair land , in days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="2">Once dwelt a prince , of youthful charms , a store ;</l>
     <l n="3">Each FAIR , with anxious look , his favours sought ,</l>
     <l n="4">And ev'ry heart within his net was caught .</l>
     <l n="5">Quite proud of beauteous form and smart address ,</l>
     <l n="6">In which the world was led to acquiesce ,</l>
     <l n="7">He cried one day , while ALL attention paid ,</l>
     <l n="8">I 'll bet a million , Nature never made</l>
     <l n="9">Beneath the sun , another man like me ,</l>
     <l n="10">Whose symmetry with mine can well agree .</l>
     <l n="11">If such exist , and here will come , I swear</l>
     <l n="12">I 'll show him ev'ry lib'ral princely care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">A noble Roman , who the challenge heard ,</l>
     <l n="14">This answer gave the king his soul preferr 'd</l>
     <l n="15">— Great prince , if you would see a handsome man ,</l>
     <l n="16">To have my brother here should be your plan ;</l>
     <l n="17">A frame more perfect Nature never gave ;</l>
     <l n="18">But this to prove , your courtly dames I crave ;</l>
     <l n="19">May judge the fact , when I 'm convinc 'd they 'll find :</l>
     <l n="20">Like you , the youth will please all womankind ;</l>
     <l n="21">And since so many sweets at once may cloy ,</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Twere well to have a partner in your joy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">THE king , surpris 'd , expressed a wish to view</l>
     <l n="24">This brother , form 'd by lines so very true ;</l>
     <l n="25">We 'll see , said he , if here his charms divine</l>
     <l n="26">Attract the heart of ev'ry nymph , like mine ;</l>
     <l n="27">And should success attend our am'rous lord ,</l>
     <l n="28">To you , my friend , full credit we 'll accord .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">AWAY the Roman flew , Joconde to get ,</l>
     <l n="30">( So nam 'd was he in whom these features met ;)</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Midst woods and lawns , retir 'd from city strife ,</l>
     <l n="32">And lately wedded to a beauteous wife ;</l>
     <l n="33">If bless 'd , I know not ; but with such a fair ,</l>
     <l n="34">On him must rest the folly to despair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">THE Roman courtier came , his business told</l>
     <l n="36">The brilliant offers from the monarch bold ;</l>
     <l n="37">His mission had success , but still the youth</l>
     <l n="38">Distraction felt , which ‘ gan to shake his truth ;</l>
     <l n="39">A pow'rful monarch 's favour there he view 'd ;</l>
     <l n="40">A partner here , with melting tears bedew 'd ;</l>
     <l n="41">And while he wavered on the painful choice ,</l>
     <l n="42">She thus address 'd her spouse with plaintive voice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="43">CAN you , Joconde , so truly cruel prove ,</l>
     <l n="44">To quit my fervent love in courts to move ?</l>
     <l n="45">The promises of kings are airy dreams ,</l>
     <l n="46">And scarcely last beyond the day 's extremes</l>
     <l n="47">By watchful , anxious care alone retain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="48">And lost , through mere caprice , as soon as gain 'd .</l>
     <l n="49">If weary of my charms , alas ! you feel ,</l>
     <l n="50">Still think , my love , what joys these woods conceal ;</l>
     <l n="51">Here dwell around tranquillity and ease ;</l>
     <l n="52">The streams ’ soft murmurs , and the balmy breeze ,</l>
     <l n="53">Invite to sleep ; these vales where breathe the doves ,</l>
     <l n="54">All , all , my dear Joconde , renew our loves ;</l>
     <l n="55">You laugh !— Ah ! cruel , go , expose thy charms ,</l>
     <l n="56">Grim death will quickly spare me these alarms !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">JOCONDE 'S reply our records ne'er relate ,</l>
     <l n="58">Nor what he did , nor how he left his mate ;</l>
     <l n="59">And since contemp'raries decline the task ;</l>
     <l n="60">‘ Twere folly , such details of me to ask .</l>
     <l n="61">We 're told , howe'er , when ready to depart ,</l>
     <l n="62">With flowing tears she press 'd him to her heart ;</l>
     <l n="63">And on his arm a brilliant bracelet plac 'd ,</l>
     <l n="64">With hair around her picture nicely trac 'd ;</l>
     <l n="65">This guard in full remembrance of my love ,</l>
     <l n="66">She cried ;— then clasped her hands to pow'rs above .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="67">TO see such dire distress , and poignant grief ,</l>
     <l n="68">Might lead to think , soon death would bring relief ;</l>

     <l n="70">At best oft doubt affliction of the kind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="71">JOCONDE set out at length ; but that same morn ;</l>
     <l n="72">As on he mov 'd , his soul with anguish torn ,</l>
     <l n="73">He found the picture he had quite forgot ,</l>
     <l n="74">Then turn 'd his steed , and back began to trot .</l>
     <l n="75">While musing what excuse to make his mate ,</l>
     <l n="76">At home he soon arriv 'd , and op 'd the gate ;</l>
     <l n="77">Alighted unobserv 'd , ran up the stairs ;</l>
     <l n="78">And ent'ring to the lady unawares ,</l>
     <l n="79">He found this darling rib , so full of charms ;</l>

     <l n="84">In this dilemma , clearly acted right ;</l>
     <l n="85">The less of such misfortunes said is best ;</l>

     <l n="87">Their lives , through pity , or prudential care ;</l>
     <l n="88">With much reluctance , he was led to spare ;</l>

     <l n="422">Which soon a husband in her train enroll 'd ,</l>
     <l n="423">Who , for a maid , the pretty fair-one took ;</l>
     <l n="424">And then our heroes wand'ring pranks forsook ,</l>
     <l n="425">With laurels cover 'd , which in future times ,</l>
     <l n="426">Will make them famous through the Western climes ;</l>
     <l n="427">More glorious since , they only cost , we find ,</l>
     <l n="428">Those sweet ATTENTIONS pleasing to the MIND .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="45">
     <l n="429">So many conquests proud of having made ,</l>
     <l n="430">And over full the BOOK of — those who 'd play 'd ;</l>
     <l n="431">Said gay Astolphus we will now , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="432">Return the shortest road and poaching end ;</l>
     <l n="433">If false our mates , yet we 'll console ourselves ,</l>
     <l n="434">That many others have inconstant elves .</l>
     <l n="435">Perhaps , in things a change will be one day ,</l>
     <l n="436">And only tender flames LOVE 'S torch display ;</l>
     <l n="437">But now it seems some evil star presides ,</l>
     <l n="438">And Hymen 's flock the devil surely rides .</l>
     <l n="439">Besides , vile fiends the universe pervade ,</l>
     <l n="440">Whose constant aim is mortals to degrade ,</l>
     <l n="441">And cheat us to our noses if they can ,</l>
     <l n="442">( Hell 's imps in human shape , disgrace to man ! )</l>
     <l n="443">Perhaps these wretches have bewitch 'd our wives ,</l>
     <l n="444">And made us fancy errors in their lives .</l>
     <l n="445">Then let us like good citizens , our days</l>
     <l n="446">In future pass amidst domestick ways ;</l>
     <l n="447">Our absence may indeed restore their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="448">For jealousy oft virtuous truths imparts .</l>

     <l n="451">A little scolding first assail 'd the ear ;</l>
     <l n="452">But blissful kisses banish 'd ev'ry fear .</l>
     <l n="453">To balls and banquets ALL themselves resigned ;</l>
     <l n="454">Of dwarf or valet nothing more we find ;</l>
     <l n="455">Each with his wife contentedly remained :—</l>
