    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">The meagre information known about James Bramston 's life has been ably summarized by F. P. Lock in his introduction to The Man of Taste ( ARS 171 ) . For our present purposes , we need only add that Bramston seems to have been acquainted with Pope , who saw The Art of Politicks before it was printed and thought it “ pretty ” . [ A ] Bramston quite likely met Pope through John Caryll , whose Sussex estate , Lady-Holt , was in the neighborhood of Bramston 's parishes .</p>
    <p n="2">The Art of Politicks , Bramston 's first English poem , was published anonymously in 1729 and advertised in the Monthly Chronicle of 8 December . Several reimpressions followed , as did another London edition , one from Edinburgh , and two from Dublin , all dated 1729 , and a London edition of 1731 . [ B ] It was reprinted in Robert Dodsley 's Collection of Poems , by Several Hands ( 1748 ) , where it was attributed to Bramston , and in John Bell 's Classical Arrangement of Fugitive Poetry , Volume 5 ( 1789 ) , with a few notes . [ C ] Horace Walpole 's copy of Dodsley 's Collection , with a few rather uninformative manuscript notes , is now in the British Library ( C. 117. aa. 16 ) .</p>
    <p n="3">It seems likely that the poem was completed in the summer of 1729 . The most recent events that Bramston alludes to are Thomas Woolston 's trial for blasphemy of 4 March ( p. 27 ) and Sir Paul Methuen 's resignation as Treasurer of the King 's Household , which was reported in May ( p. 13 ) . [ D ]</p>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Horace 's Ars Poetica was one of the most fertile sources for eighteenth-century imitations and adaptations . Some were completely serious attempts to marry one art to another or to show that all arts share the same fundamental principles ; an example of this type is John Gwynn 's Art of Architecture ( 1742 ; ARS 144 ) . Others , like William King 's Art of Cookery ( 1708 ) are downright burlesques .</p>
   <p>Bramston 's usual method falls somewhere between these extremes . He often uses the dignity of poetry to show up the indignity of politics or political writing , as on pp . 5-6 where Horace 's advice on choice of subject is transformed into advice to “ Weekly Writers of seditious News , ” or on page 7 , where the rise and fall of South Sea stock fills the place of Horace 's famous comparison of archaic and new-coined words to the leaves of the forest . But Bramston 's poem more often aspires to the same level as its model ; in this respect it resembles Absalom and Achitophel more than Mac Flecknoe .</p>
   <p>Several factors help to bring Ars Poetica and The Art of Politicks together . Perhaps most important , Bramston conceives of politics primarily as a verbal art , the use of speech to persuade others to a course of action . Bribes and other crasser incentives appear in the poem , of course , but they are clearly the result of declining standards . For Bramston , rhetoric should govern politics ; the House of Commons is a reincarnation of a Roman senate or courtroom . Bramston 's inclusion of political writing as well as politics itself in his poem also helps to keep him in Horace 's orbit . On Horace 's side , his conception of poetry is basically rhetorical and persuasive ; it should instruct and delight , move to laughter or tears . Horace 's readiness to digress into literary history gives Bramston many opportunities to bring in political history . The Ars Poetica is very much concerned with the world of men ; poets are seen in their social roles , and Horace 's standards of literary decorum are usually based on social norms : young men in plays should behave the way young men are observed to behave in real life . The Ars Poetica also contains several sharp satiric darts ; Horace 's contrast between the eloquence of ancient Greece and the commercial arithmetic of modern Rome slides easily into a contrast between Elizabethan learning and Hanoverian place-hunting ( pp. 32-33 ) . Finally , Horace 's urbane and chatty style is as suitable for other subjects as it is for poetry . To appreciate Horace 's adaptability , one need only imagine the difficulty of writing an art of politics in imitation of Archibald MacLeish 's “ Ars Poetica ” or Aristotle 's Poetics .</p>
   <p>Though he does not pretend to Pope 's image of himself as a new Horace bringing the whole weight of Roman tradition to bear on contemporary society , Bramston is very clever on the local level at transposing Horace for his own purposes . Horace recounts the increasing complexity and sophistication of theatrical music , Bramston the increasingly elaborated musical celebrations of victorious candidates ( pp . 22-23 ) , and Horace 's implication that the sophistication of taste is really a decline — “ an impetuous style brought in an unwonted diction ” ( 217 ) — constitutes an unspoken comment on Bramston 's subject . [ E ] Bramston 's page 27 corresponds to Horace 's brief history of the theatre , from Thespis 's tragedies that he staged on wagons to the silencing of the excessively outspoken chorus of Old Comedy ( 275-84 ) . Bramston replaces Thespis with Defoe , and the wagon-mounted stage with the cart and pillory . Instead of deploring the silencing of the chorus , Bramston applauds the silencing of Woolston . The contrast between Thespis and Defoe is clearly mock-heroic , but Bramston implies that Woolston 's similarity to an ancient satyr is a decline from the character expected of a modern clergyman .</p>
   <p>Sometimes the mere fact of changing from a poetic to a political context produces the satire or humour . What is praiseworthy in a poet — the ability to mingle fact and fiction skillfully ( 151 ) — becomes highly ironic when applied to a politician who</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>More humourous than satirical is the relation between Horace 's declaration that there 's no place for a mediocre poet ( 372-73 ) and Bramston 's</p>

     <l n="4">On either side is , Honest Man , or Rogue . ( pp . 37-38 )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The conclusion of the poem involves a somewhat more complex transformation . Horace closes with a humourously self-deprecating description of the “ poetic itch ": the afflicted poet stumbles into ditches as he babbles his verses aloud ; people flee from him , and with good reason ; if he catches anyone , he hangs on like a leech and reads his victim to death . Bramston describes another “ sort of itch , ” parliamenteering . Sir Harry Clodpole knows better than to make speeches to the electors ; he solicits their votes by feasting them , and they run towards him ( or his table ) , not away . They , not he , are the leeches ; “ they never leave him while he 's worth a groat ” ( p. 45 ) .</p>
   <p>Bramston — it seems an excessive refinement to speak of a persona or narrator — presents himself as a rather simple , naive political observer who yearns for clear-cut distinctions between parties ; he wants to know where politicians stand on issues . The confusion , the blurring of old party lines , in present-day England is like the monster in the frontispiece . Though simple , he is also well informed . He seems to have a good knowledge of British history since the Restoration , referring casually to the Exclusion Crisis of 1680-81 ( p. 15 ) , the Kentish Petition of 1701 ( p. 10 ) , and the South Sea Bubble of 1720 ( p. 7 ) . All these past events are used to reinforce present lessons . He is up-to-date , as shown by his reference to the recent events in the careers of Methuen and Woolston . He professes familiarity with the characters of the leading politicians and also knows something about what is going on in the constituencies . He knows , or claims to know , how different kinds of listeners will react to different kinds of speeches .</p>
   <p>For a son of Christ Church , one of the most Tory Colleges of Tory Oxford , he seems remarkably non-partisan , though his Opposition biases do show through . When he says that “ Addison 's immortal Page ” shows us how “ to screen good Ministers from Publick rage ” ( p. 9 ) , he is clearly aiming at Walpole , known as the “ Screenmaster General ” since his success in shielding many of the perpetrators of the South Sea Bubble in 1720 . ( I have not been able to discover the passage of Addison that Bramston had in mind . ) When the aspiring orator is urged not to “ join with silver Tongue a brazen Face ” ( p. 24 ) , Walpole is again present by innuendo , for “ brazen-face ” was another of his nicknames . On the other hand , Bramston also makes fun of the “ everlasting Fame ” that results from quibbling on Sir Robert 's name ( p. 6 ) . Bramston perhaps has it both ways here ; while ridiculing commonplace puns , he also invites us to remember that “ Robin ” does indeed sound very much like “ robbing . ”</p>
   <p>Sometimes he is more subtle and ironic . This subtlety caused difficulty for at least one contemporary reader , and may do the same for us . Consider the following passage , which parallels Horace 's advice always to show Achilles wrathful , Orestes mourning , and the like :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">To Likelihood your Characters confine ;</l>

   </lg>
   <p>This critic finds two main faults in the poem : misinformation and confusion about particular individuals and , more generally , an inability to distinguish Whigs from Tories and give each their due . This last complaint of course mocks Bramston 's lament at the beginning of the poem about the current lack of distinction between parties .</p>
   <p>To what extent is this critique justified ? What is Bramston trying to do in this passage ? There is no problem with the second line : Sir Paul Methuen did indeed resign his office , and one gets the impression from Hervey ( pp . 101-2 , 250 ) that he never let anyone forget that he resigned . Thus we have here the most conventional of truisms . Walpole is more difficult . He was certainly no friend of the universities , which were Tory hotbeds . On the other hand , he was reluctant to try to reduce their privileges or bring them more closely under government control , for fear of rousing them to keener opposition . Nowhere else did he follow so faithfully his policy of letting sleeping dogs lie . [ G ] In a certain sense , then , he might be called a friend of the universities . I have been unable to determine whom Bramston means by “ Maidston ” — perhaps one of the Finches , the most prominent family in the area of Maidstone , Kent . Bramston 's critic is certainly right about the Pelhams : they have nothing whatever in common with the Scipios . Scipio Africanus Major ( 236-184 / 3 ) was one of the most illustrious Roman heroes , consul during the Second Punic War and an outstanding military tactician . Scipio Africanus Minor ( c. 185-129 ) was not only a consul and a military hero but a great patron of letters whom Cicero considered the greatest Roman of them all . [ H ] Thomas Pelham-Holles , Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne ( 1693-1768 ) , Walpole 's chief election manager , was notoriously muddle-headed , nervous , embarrassed , swamped in petty detail , suspicious , fretful , pompous , and indecisive . [ I ] His brother , Henry Pelham ( 1695 ? - 1754 ) , was much less well known ; reserved and withdrawn , he preferred to work in the background , and his tactical and organizational abilities were not recognized until considerably later . [ J ] As far as their public image was concerned , then , no two men could be less like the Scipios . Most contemporaries agreed with Bramston 's praise of John Carteret , Earl Granville ( 1690-1763 ) , though many of them also mention other , less admirable traits . [ K ] As for George II , it depends on whose hearts you consult . An anonymous journalist :</p>
   <p>What an Assurance has the Kingdom already given of an unfeigned Affection to their Majesties Persons and Government ? How do the People shew that none are acceptable to them , but those that are so to their Majesties ? How can Subjects give stronger Proofs of the high Esteem they have their Sovereign in , for Penetration and Wisdom , than those who entirely rely upon the Royal Discerning , and regulate their Conduct by the King 's Direction ? [ L ]</p>
   <p>William Pultney :</p>
   <p>The Queen is hated , the King despised , their son both the one and the other , and such a spirit of disaffection to the family and general discontent with the present Government is spread all over the Kingdom , that it is absolutely impossible for things to go on in the track they are now in . [ M ]</p>
   <p>By now Bramston 's method should be clear : he is praising everyone , but the praise fits the Opposition ( such as Carteret ) much better than it does the Government ( the Pelhams ) . There is perhaps room for doubt about Walpole and George II , but Bramston 's critic 's failure to see the irony in the comparison of Pelhams to Scipios must be the result of sheer obtuseness . The rationale for Bramston 's technique becomes clearer if we look again at Horace and recall that the basis of his advice is to follow conventional opinion . The conventional opinions that Bramston is by implication urging his pupil to follow are those of the politician 's supporters and dependents . It just happens that Bramston has chosen his examples so that the Opposition conventions are closer to reality than the Government conventions . [ N ]</p>
   <p>All this is fun , but it is quite inoffensive . There 's no animus , no vehemence , no bite . Politics do not really engage any of Bramston 's strong convictions . The self-portrait he offers us on pages 29-30 would be for many political satirists of the period a transparent facade of mock-innocence , but it seems to fit Bramston very accurately :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Alas Poor Me , you may my fortune guess :</l>
     <l n="2">I write , and yet Humanity profess :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">I love the King , the Queen , and Royal Race :</l>

     <l n="6">I Politicks to Poetry convert .</l>

     <l n="7">By contrast to the increasing acrimony of most political satire of the</l>

    <head>NOTES TO THE ART OF POLITICKS</head>
    <head>Given the topical nature of The Art of Politicks , the best use of my remaining space is probably to annotate the poem . From what I have learned about its background — and many mysteries remain — I have tried to choose what seems most relevant . In the interests of saving space , and since full annotation is not possible anyway , I have kept documentation to a minimum , especially where the information comes from easily available sources like the DNB or , conversely , has been pieced together from several sources . Some works are occasionally referred to by abbreviation or author 's name ; the ones not mentioned in the Notes to the Introduction are the following :[ O ]</head>

   <p>P. 12 , line 4. the Rod : that is , the rod of the Serjeant-at-Arms , the officer responsible for keeping order in the House of Commons .</p>
   <p>line 6. the Bar : The Bar marked the outer limit of the House , and , as the lines imply , was where offenders stood to be reprimanded .</p>
   <p>lines 11-12 . The “ one cause ” is presumably Walpole 's patronage . The Cornish constituencies were notoriously corrupt even by eighteenth-century standards , and Walpole cultivated the Scots assiduously . A Scottish “ laird ” is a landowner , not a “ lord ” in the English sense .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">P. 13 , line 12 . Flying-Squadron : apparently a group which claimed to</l>
     <l n="2">vote by principle rather than from attachment to any party . Sir Joseph</l>
     <l n="3">Jekyll was considered its leader . See Sedgwick , House of Commons , 2 ,</l>
     <l n="4">175 ; Realey , p. 54 ; and OED , “ Squadron 7 , ” “ Squadrone b ., ” and</l>
     <l n="5">“ Squadronist . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>P. 15 , lines 2ff . The famous speech of Colonel Silius Titus ( 7 Jan. 1681 ) was widely reported in two slightly different versions ; see Grey , 8 , 279 and Cobbett , 4 , 1291 . In both these versions the question is whether to keep the lion out or to let him in and chain him . Bramston may have been following an independent tradition or merely exercising poetic license . The lion is , of course , James , Duke of York , the Roman Catholic heir to the throne .</p>
   <p>Lane : Sir Richard Lane ( c. 1667-1756 ) , MP for Worcester 1727-34 . He was a merchant , sugar baker , and salt trader , and a consistent supporter of the administration . For examples of his indecorous use of biblical allusions see Sedgwick , 2 , 197-98 ( the “ bantering speech ” mentioned there used the Book of Revelation to prove that merchants were the best people on earth ) ; and Knatchbull , p. 137 .</p>
   <p>P. 16 , line 5 . Rufus : King William II , son of William the Conqueror , known as William Rufus , was often evoked as an example of tyranny , as in Pope 's Windsor-Forest .</p>
   <p>P. 17 , lines 9-10 . Prince William : younger son of George II , eight years old in 1729 ; Louisa : youngest daughter of King George , then five .</p>
   <p>P. 18 , line 4 . William Shippen ( 1673-1743 ) was an extreme Tory , noted for his outspoken attacks on the Walpole ministry , one of which landed him in the Tower . Sir William Yonge ( c. 1693-1755 ) was notorious , at least among the opposition , for voluble but empty speeches in support of Walpole , “ melodious nothings ” as one satirist put it . See also Hervey , p. 36 , and TE , 4 , 394 . The attack on The Art of Politicks quoted above complains that Shippen and Yonge should be mentioned in the same breath , but Bramston 's point obviously is that the young MP cares nothing for either side .</p>

     <l n="1">P. 20 , line 8 . Polly Peachum is of course the heroine of Gay 's</l>
     <l n="2">Beggar 's Opera . The role was played by Lavinia Fenton , who</l>
     <l n="3">immediately became the toast of London . “ Old Sir John ” may be Sir John</l>
     <l n="4">Hobart ( 1693-1756 ) , although he was only fifteen years older than Miss</l>
     <l n="5">Fenton ( see Sedgwick , 2 , 142 ) . His name was sometimes spelled</l>
     <l n="6">“ Hubbard , ” and the following stanza appears in “ A New Ballad Inscrib 'd</l>
     <l n="7">to Polly Peachum ” ( British Library C-116. i. 4 # 38 ) , the cavalier</l>
     <l n="8">typography of which perhaps indicates hasty composition :</l>

     <l n="12">And did soon dispatch him .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Whoever he was , Sir John lost out to Charles Paulet , third Duke of Bolton , who kept Miss Fenton faithfully as his mistress , had three children by her , and married her on the death of his wife in 1751 .</p>
   <p>P. 21 , line 10 . The House of Commons had used St. Stephen 's Chapel as its meeting place since the mid-sixteenth century . Dover-Court is “ a proverbial term for a company , in which all are speakers and none hearers ” ( Bell ) .</p>
   <p>P. 23 , line 2 . Waits : “ a small body of wind instrumentalists maintained by a city or town at the public charge ” ( OED ) .</p>
   <p>line 10 . To sell bargains is to return indecent answers to civil questions .</p>
   <p>P. 24 , line 6 . Mother Needham was a prominent bawd , notorious for her foul language . See TE , 4 , 374-75 , and 5 , 293-94 .</p>
   <p>lines 7-8 . “ Oldfieldismus ” and “ Kibberismus ” refer respectively to the styles of Anne Oldfield , a well-known actress , and Colley Cibber , playwright , stage manager , and hero of the Dunciad . Mrs. Oldfield was generally respected , but Pope , like Bramston , seems to have disliked her ( TE , 4 , 375 ) .</p>
   <p>line 11 . Tallboy was a booby young lover in Richard Brome 's comedy The Jovial Crew ( 1641 ) , popular throughout the eighteenth century .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">P. 26 , line 12 . Mist : Nathaniel Mist , Tory journalist . See TE , 5 , 448 .</l>
     <l n="2">Eusden : Laurence Eusden , Poet Laureate 1718-30 , often ridiculed by</l>
     <l n="3">Pope .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>line 14 . Cibber 's opera is Love in a Riddle ( 1729 ) , designed to capitalize on the craze for ballad opera created by The Beggar 's Opera .</p>
   <p>P. 27 , line 5 . Censor : Sir Richard Steele as Isaac Bickerstaffe , the nominal author of The Tatler .</p>
   <p>P. 29 , line 6 . Where Edmund Curll stood was in the pillory .</p>
   <p>P. 31 , line 3 . Hugo Grotius 's classic of political science , De jure belli ac pacis , was published in 1625 and translated in 1654 .</p>
   <p>P. 32 , line 1 . Wickfort : Abraham de Wicquefort , l'Ambassadeur et ses fonctions ( La Haye , 1680 ) . It was summarized in The Craftsman of 23 Sept. 1727 .</p>
   <p>line 4 . John Banks was the author of The Unhappy Favourite ; or the Earl of Essex ( 1681 ) and of The Island Queens , or the Death of Mary , Queen of Scotland ( prohibited in 1684 ; a revision was produced in 1704 ) . Bell says that although “ written in the most contemptible language , yet they never fail to melt the audience into tears , merely by the force of judicious and well-arranged plots and incidents . ”</p>
   <p>P. 33 , line 1 . Arch-Bishop : William Wake , Archbishop of Canterbury since 1716 . He was 72 in 1729 . Master of the Rolls : Sir Joseph Jekyll , who had held the office since 1717 , was about 66 in 1729 .</p>
   <p>line 12 . Spence : Thomas Spence ( d. 1737 ) , Serjeant-at-Arms .</p>
   <p>P. 34 , line 3 . Toft : In 1726 one Mary Toft claimed to have given birth to seventeen live rabbits , and some who should have known better believed her . See Pope 's poem on her , TE , 6 , 259 , and Hogarth 's engraving .</p>
   <p>throws : i. e ., throes , labor pains .</p>
   <p>line 8 : Bromley and Hanmer : William Bromley (? 1663-1732 ) , MP for Oxford 1701-32 , Speaker 1710-13 ; Sir Thomas Hanmer ( 1677-1746 ) , who represented several constituencies from 1701-27 and was Speaker 1714-15 . They were Tory heroes , at least to Atterbury , for having refused the places offered them by George I in 1715 ( Foord , p. 51 ) .</p>
   <p>P. 35 , line 1 . Tonson : Jacob Tonson , prominent bookseller .</p>
   <p>line 9 . Cler . Dom . Com . : “ Clerk of the House of Commons . ”</p>
   <p>P. 36 , line 2 . Die Martis is Tuesday ; Thursday is Die Jovis .</p>
   <p>line 6 . Wyndham : Sir William Wyndham , MP for Somerset 1710-40 , prominent opposition leader from the 1720s . See Sedgwick , 2 , 562-64 , for his reputation . Hervey believed that his high reputation was partly due to Walpole 's henchmen , who inflated it in order to deflate Pultney 's ( p. 21 ) .</p>
   <p>P. 44 , line 4 . Sir Robert Fagg was better known for horse-racing and wenching than for politics ; he appears in Hogarth 's painting of The Beggar 's Opera admiring Lavinia Fenton and in the ballad cited in my note to p. 20 , line 8 . Running for Parliament in the borough of Steyning , Sussex , in 1722 , he came in third in a five-man race with nineteen votes . He also ran third in 1727 ; the vote is not recorded , unless Bramston 's “ two Voices ” is to be taken literally .</p>
