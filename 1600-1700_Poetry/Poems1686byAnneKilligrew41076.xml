    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Condemnation by a great poet has lasting impact , while the effects of praise seldom endure ; Shadwell remains MacFlecknoe in our minds , Shaftesbury Achitophel , but Anne Killigrew , “ A Grace for Beauty , and a Muse for Wit , ” is virtually forgotten . Her book of verses is known essentially because of John Dryden 's commendatory Ode . Yet we may justify a study of her own poems . Dryden 's piece is not a generalised encomium ; obviously he had read her verses , and his analysis of her art is firmly based . Our understanding of this famous poem , then , depends to some degree on our knowledge of Anne Killigrew 's output .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Her verses deserve attention on their own merits — Dryden may well be thought more gallant than scrupulous , but undeniably the poems have an appealing wit , a picturesque imagination and a touching personal candour .</p>
    <p n="2">The facts of Anne Killigrew 's short life are succinctly and elegantly related by Anthony Wood .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>She was born about 1660 , the daughter of Dr. Henry Killigrew , Royalist , theologian and sometime dramatist , and related through his family to the other theatrical Killigrews — Thomas , the author of The Parson 's Wedding , and Sir William , her uncles ; and Thomas , the author of Chit-Chat , and Charles , Master of the Revels , her cousins . Dr. Killigrew became Chaplain to the Duke of York and in 1663 Master of the Savoy . Anne Killigrew grew up to join the household of the doleful Mary of Modena , Duchess of York , as Maid of Honour . A companion in this office was Anne Finch , Countess of Winchelsea . Mistress Killigrew 's poems reflect some of the sparkle of Restoration court life , but more of the sorrow produced by Mary of Modena 's consistent unpopularity . After a short battle with the smallpox , Anne Killigrew died on 16 June , 1685 , to the “ unspeakable Reluctancy ” of her many loving relations and friends .</p>
    <p n="3"><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The most recent study of Dryden 's poem is David M. Vieth 's “ Irony in Dryden 's Ode to Anne Killigrew , ” Studies in Philology , LXII ( January , 1965 ) , pp . 91-100 , which lists earlier criticism . Professor Vieth refers to Anne Killigrew 's poems several times to illustrate his theory of Dryden 's intentions .</p>
    <p n="4"><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Anthony Wood , Athenae Oxonienses ( 1721 ) , c. 1036 . Biographical and critical comment is also to be found in George Ballard , Memoirs of Several Ladies ( 1752 ) , pp . 337-45 ; T. Cibber , Lives of the Poets ( 1753 ) , II , 224-6 ; Ellen Creathorne Clayton , English Female Artists ( 1876 ) , I , 59-70 and The Poems of Anne Countess of Winchelsea , edited by Myra Reynolds ( 1903 ) , pp . xxiii-xxiv .</p>
    <p n="5">After her untimely death , Dr. Killigrew worked to produce a memorial edition of her papers , and invited Dryden to write the prefatory poem . The publication was swift : less than three months after her death the volume was licensed to be printed ( 30 September , 1685 ) and listed in the Stationers ’ Register ( 2 October ) . It was listed in the Term Catalogue for November , and advertised in The Observator on 2 November , 1685 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The date of 1686 on the title page must have been anticipated by actual publication .</p>
    <p n="6"><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>A bibliographical analysis of the volume is given by Hugh Macdonald , John Dryden a Bibliography ( 1939 ) , pp . 42-43 .</p>
    <p n="7">The poetry in the volume can be described in Dryden 's terms :</p>
    <p n="8">Art she had none , yet wanted none : For Nature did that Want supply .</p>
    <p n="9">Anne Killigrew lacked the artistry which comes from discipline and practice ( which Anne Finch had time to develop ) , but she felt that the prompting of passion outweighed the niceties of form :</p>
    <p n="10">Here take no Care , take here no Care , my Muse , Nor ought of Art or Labour use .... The ruggeder my Measures run when read , They'l livelier paint th ’ unequal Paths fond Mortals tread , ( p. 51 )</p>
    <p n="11">Her verses belong to the generalising conventions of strong-minded Denham and limpid Waller :</p>
    <p n="12">Such Noble Vigour did her Verse adorn , That it seem 'd borrow 'd .</p>
    <p n="13">Yet to judge from her lively objections ( pp . 44-47 ) , the attempt to class her as a plagiarist was unjustified . Court poetry in the age was so uniform that apparent echoes are a matter of course . We may compare her</p>
    <p n="14">The bloody Wolf , the Wolf does not pursue ; The Boar , though fierce , his Tusk will not embrue In his own Kind , Bares , not on Bares do prey : Then art thou , Man , more savage far than they , ( p. 37 )</p>
    <p n="15">with Rochester 's Satyr against Mankind :</p>
    <p n="16">Birds , feed on Birds , Beasts , on each other prey , But Savage Man alone , does Man betray ,</p>
    <p n="17">or Waller on the death of Lady Rich , “ But savage beasts , or men as wild as they ! ” Anne Killigrew 's use of stock epithets and polite locutions mark a conventionality which inevitably borders on the derivative . But at her best , as for example “ On the Birth-Day of Queen Katherine , ” p. 47 , she is able to move effectively beyond the conventional . The conflict between the formal occasion and the dismal weather becomes a surprising symbol of paradox , and the dream and scriptural consolation come to have an intensity more metaphysical than courtly . Similarly , in the unfinished “ Ode , ” p. 82 , or in parts of the “ Pastoral Dialogue , ” p. 63 , she produces some forceful and startling images .</p>
    <p n="18">The individuality of her works lies in their firm , evangelical moral tone , which is clearly distinguishable from the genteel piety of her contemporaries . Dryden 's comment :</p>
    <p n="19">So cold herself , whilst she such Warmth exprest , ‘ Twas Cupid bathing in Diana 's Stream ,</p>
    <p n="20">is an apt description of , say , her “ Pastoral Dialogue , ” pp . 63-75 . Anne Killigrew 's interest in poetic theory is notable ; her early “ Alexandreis ” prays for the “ frozen style ” to be warmed with a “ Poetique fire , ” and her “ Love , the Soul of Poetry , ” contrasts the flatness of commonplace verse with the rapture and heat produced by a subject which “ Enlarg 'd his Fancy , and set free his Muse . ” The poem “ To My Lord Colrane ” meditates on her slothful muse and its awakening of life . Throughout her writings she keeps the poet 's didactic end in view and has a high regard for the nature of her art . Something of the severity of the York household is reflected in the writings of the Maid of Honour .</p>
    <p n="21">The present text is reproduced , by kind permission , from the beautiful copy in the Alexander Turnbull Library , Wellington . This volume , originally in Dr. Philip Bliss 's collection , is listed in the Huth Catalogue ( 1913 ) , p. 1207 , and described by W. C. Hazlitt , Second Series of Bibliographical Collections and Notes ( 1882 ) , p. 328 . It contains on the flyleaf a MS poem by E. E ., transcribed below . The Rev . Joseph Hunter , British Museum Add . MSS . 24492 , Vol . VI , p. 100 , suggests that E. E. was Edmund Elys ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>the learned and contentious author of occasional poems ( Verses on Several Occasions , 1699 ) and theological pamphlets ( for example , Epistola ad Sam . Parkerum S. T. P ., 1680 ) . The generally vivacious style of the verse and the reference to the debate with Dr. Parker suggest that the identification is just , but the relationship between Mrs. Elys and the Killigrews is not known . Pages 72 and 73 are skipped , and pages 68 and 69 are misnumbered 60 and 61 .</p>
    <p n="22"><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>On Elys 's life see Anthony Wood , Athenae Oxonienses ( 1721 ) , c. 943-44 .</p>
    <p n="23">The self-portrait of Anne Killigrew prefixed to the Poems and printed herein as the frontispiece shows that she was a competent if conventional artist . Her descriptions of her paintings , pp . 27-29 , suggest that here too moral and scriptural topics predominated over courtly affairs . E. E ., Dryden and the writer of the Epitaph agree on Anne Killigrew 's sanctity and gravity of mind . The modern reader may gain from her book of verse a moving insight into the thoughts and preoccupations of a young lady at court in the declining years of the Stuarts .</p>

    <p n="26">Notes on the Poems</p>
    <p n="27">Several of Anne Killigrew 's friends and relatives appear in the volume :</p>
    <p n="28">sig . b 2 “ her Warlike Brother ” is Henry Killigrew ( d. 1712 ) , commodore in the 1680 's and eventually Admiral , who was on duty in the Mediterranean when Dryden wrote .</p>
    <p n="29">p. 24 Lady Berkeley and her son are the wife and son , John , of John , first Baron Berkeley of Stratton ( d. 1687 ) . John the younger was lieutenant in 1685 and attained the rank of Admiral in 1688 .</p>
    <p n="30">p. 49 Lord Colrane is Henry Hare , second Baron Coleraine ( 1636-1708 ) , the distinguished antiquary . A copy of the Poems bearing his bookplate , dated 1702 , is in the University of Michigan Library .</p>
    <p n="31">p. 76 Mrs. A. K ., the victim of this extraordinary accident shortly before the civil broils , was probably Anne , daughter of Sir Robert Killigrew , the poetess 's grandfather .</p>
    <p n="32">p. 79 The Duchess of Grafton is the daughter of Henry Bennet , Earl of Arlington and wife of Henry Fitzroy , Duke of Grafton and son to Charles II and Barbara Villiers .</p>
    <p n="33">On the Death of The Truly Virtuous</p>
    <p n="34">Mrs. Anne Killigrew</p>
    <p n="35">who was Related to my ( Deceased ) Wife .</p>
    <p n="36">I cannot Mourn thy Fate , Sweet Mayd , but Joy That Thou art gone from all this Worlds Annoy , From th ’ hurry of this cursed Age , that draws Heav'ns Vengeance down by th ’ breach of all the Laws . Of GOD , &amp; Man : ther 's nothing here but Noise And Interruption of True Peacefull Joyes . That which they Pleasure call is Sport for Apes Which turns the Phansie to a thousand Shapes And Wrests the Mind from that Celestial Sphear To which Its Nature ever would adhere That by a Constant Revolution Its Rest &amp; Motion ever might be ONE That which my Mind hath ever Sought , thy Mind Tho Compast with these walls of Clay did Find : Pure Quintessential Love , Aethereal Flame , Which Always shines , &amp; Alwayes is the Same : Here 's no faint trembling Flame : all Bright appears ‘ Tis ne 're blown out with Sighs , nor quencht with tears . Thy Soul Enflames my Love : the Unitie I had with Her , who was Allie 'd to Thee Is Now made Perfect : Our Souls Mutual Flame Tho Higher in Degree in Nature 's still the same .</p>
    <p n="37">Her , Thee , &amp; All the Glorious Souls Above I Now Enioy , whilst in You All I Love The Boundless Spring of Joy to Ev'ry Mind That knowes what 's Truly Fair &amp; Knowes what 's Truly Kind . How have I Labour 'd to Depress the Pride Of one [ Dr. Parker ] that strives Illustrious Truth to Hide In the Thick Bushes of Learn 'd Sophistrie , Which he that Enters hardly sees the Skie ? Truth that thy Splendid Soul did clearly see And of it made a plain Discoverie . And having Conquer 'd Fate , Thou leavst those Arms [ Her Poems ] By which Mankind may Conquer All their Harms And make them Serve their Noble Purposes . All Good to Gain , All Evil to Repress . How Bravely did thy Melibaeus shew The Madness of that Love most men pursue And how Youth may their strongest Lusts subdue ! O Happy Mayd , who didst so soon Espie In This Dark Life , that All is Vanitie ! May thy Bright Love , All Youthfull Minds Inspire , And like the SUN , put out all other Fire ; May all the Virtuous Celebrate thy Name ; All Poets Hearts Partake of thy Great Flame That all their Ardors &amp; their Flights may be The Flames that Fly up to the Deitie ; That DAVID 's Muse they all may Imitate , Sing Virtues Triumphs ore the Power of Fate : That all their Works Resembling Hea'vn may prove The Blest Effects of Glory , Power , &amp; Love .</p>
