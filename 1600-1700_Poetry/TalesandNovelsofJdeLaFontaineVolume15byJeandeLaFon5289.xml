    <head>THE MANDRAKE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">FLORENTINE we now design to show ;—</l>
     <l n="2">A greater blockhead ne'er appeared below ;</l>
     <l n="3">It seems a prudent woman he had wed ,</l>
     <l n="4">With beauty that might grace a monarch 's bed ;</l>
     <l n="5">Young , brisk , good-humoured , with engaging mien ;</l>
     <l n="6">None in the town , or round , the like was seen :</l>
     <l n="7">Her praises every voice inclined to sing ,</l>
     <l n="8">And judged her worthy of a mighty king ;</l>
     <l n="9">At least a better husband she deserved :</l>
     <l n="10">An arrant fool he looked , and quite unnerved .</l>
     <l n="11">This Nicia Calfucci ( for such his name )</l>
     <l n="12">Was fully bent to have a father 's fame ,</l>
     <l n="13">And thought his country honour he could do ,</l>
     <l n="14">Could he contrive his lineage to pursue .</l>
     <l n="15">No holy saint in Paradise was blessed ,</l>
     <l n="16">But what this husband fervently addressed ;</l>
     <l n="17">From day to day , so oft he teazed for grace ,</l>
     <l n="18">They scarcely knew his off'rings where to place .</l>
     <l n="19">No matron , quack , nor conjurer around ,</l>
     <l n="20">But what he tried their qualities profound ;</l>
     <l n="21">Yet all in vain : in spite of charm or book ,</l>
     <l n="22">No father he , whatever pains he took .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">TO Florence then returned a youth from France ;</l>
     <l n="24">Where he had studied ,— more than complaisance :</l>
     <l n="25">Well trained as any from that polished court ;</l>
     <l n="26">To Fortune 's favours anxious to resort ;</l>
     <l n="27">Gallant and seeking ev'ry FAIR to please ;</l>
     <l n="28">Each house , road , alley , soon he knew at ease ;</l>
     <l n="29">The husbands , good or bad , their whims and years ,</l>
     <l n="30">With ev'ry thing that moved their hopes or fears ;</l>
     <l n="31">What sort of fuel best their females charmed ;</l>
     <l n="32">What spies were kept by those who felt alarmed ;</l>
     <l n="33">The if 's , for 's , to 's , and ev'ry artful wile ,</l>
     <l n="34">That might in love a confidant beguile ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or nurse , or father-confessor , or dog ;</l>
     <l n="36">When passion prompts , few obstacles can clog .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">THE snares were spread , each stratagem was laid ;</l>
     <l n="38">And every thing arranged to furnish aid ,</l>
     <l n="39">When our gay spark determined to invest</l>
     <l n="40">Old Nicia with the cuckold 's branching crest .</l>
     <l n="41">The plan no doubt was well conceived and bold ;</l>
     <l n="42">The lady to her friends appeared not cold ;</l>
     <l n="43">Within her husband 's house she seemed polite ;</l>
     <l n="44">But ne'er familiarly was seen invite ,</l>
     <l n="45">No further could a lover dare proceed ;</l>
     <l n="46">Not one had hope the belle his flame would heed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">OUR youth , Calimachus , no sooner came ,</l>
     <l n="48">But he howe'er appeared to please the dame ;</l>
     <l n="49">His camp he pitched and entered on the siege</l>
     <l n="50">Of fair Lucretia , faithful to her liege ,</l>
     <l n="51">Who presently the haughty tigress played ,</l>
     <l n="52">And sent him , like the rest , away dismayed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="53">HE , scarcely knew what saint he could invoke ;</l>
     <l n="54">When Nicia 's folly served him for a cloak ;</l>
     <l n="55">However strange , no stratagem nor snare ,</l>
     <l n="56">But what the fool would willingly prepare</l>
     <l n="57">With all his heart , and nothing fancy wrong ;</l>
     <l n="58">That might to others possibly belong .</l>
     <l n="59">The lover and himself , as learned men ,</l>
     <l n="60">Had conversations ev'ry now and then ;</l>
     <l n="61">For Nicia was a doctor in the law :</l>
     <l n="62">Degree , to him , not worth a single straw ;</l>
     <l n="63">Far better had he common prudence traced ;</l>
     <l n="64">And not his confidence so badly placed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="65">ONE day he to Calimachus complained ,</l>
     <l n="66">Of want of heirs , and wished they could be gained :</l>
     <l n="67">Where lay the fault ? He was a gay gallant ;</l>
     <l n="68">Lucretia young with features to enchant .</l>
     <l n="69">When I at Paris was , replied our wight ,</l>
     <l n="70">There passed a clever man , a curious sight ,</l>
     <l n="71">His company with anxious care I sought ,</l>
     <l n="72">And was at length a hundred secrets taught ;</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Mong others how , at will , to get an heir :—</l>
     <l n="74">A certain thing , he often would declare ;</l>
     <l n="75">The great Mogul had tried it on his queen ,</l>
     <l n="76">just two years since , the heir might then be seen ;</l>
     <l n="77">And many other princesses of fame ,</l>
     <l n="78">Had added by it to their husband 's name .</l>
     <l n="79">‘ Twas very true ; I 've seen it fully proved :</l>
     <l n="80">The remedy all obstacles removed ;</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Tis from the root of certain tree expressed ;</l>
     <l n="82">A juice most potent ev'ry where confessed ,</l>
     <l n="83">And Mandrake called , which taken by a wife ;</l>
     <l n="84">More pow'r evinces o'er organick life ,</l>
     <l n="85">Than from conventual grace was e'er derived ,</l>
     <l n="86">Though in the cloister youthful friars hived .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="87">TEN months from hence I 'll you a father make ;</l>
     <l n="88">No longer time than that I ask to take ;</l>
     <l n="89">This period o'er , the child to church we 'll bring ,—</l>
     <l n="90">If true , said Nicia , what a glorious thing !</l>
     <l n="91">You 'll do me services I can n't express .—</l>
     <l n="92">Do n't doubt it , cried the spark of smart address :</l>
     <l n="93">Must I the fact so oft to you repeat ?</l>
     <l n="94">I 've seen it with my eyes ; ‘ tis most complete ;</l>
     <l n="95">You mean to jest , assuredly my friend ;</l>
     <l n="96">Would you by doubts the great Mogul offend ?</l>
     <l n="97">So handsomely this traveller he paid ,</l>
     <l n="98">No sign of discontent he e'er betrayed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="99">‘ TIS excellent , the Florentine replied ;</l>
     <l n="100">Lucretia must be pleased to have it tried ;</l>
     <l n="101">What satisfaction ! in her arms to view</l>
     <l n="102">An infant that my lineage will renew .</l>
     <l n="103">Now , worthy friend , you god-father shall stand ;</l>
     <l n="104">This very day pray take the thing in hand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="105">NOT quite so fast , rejoined our smart gallant ,</l>
     <l n="106">First know the plan , before consent you grant ;</l>
     <l n="107">There is an ill attends the whole affair ;</l>
     <l n="108">But what below , alas ! is free from care ;</l>
     <l n="109">This juice , possessing virtues so divine ,</l>
     <l n="110">Has also pow'rs that prove the most malign :</l>
     <l n="111">Whoe'er receives the patient 's first embrace ;</l>
     <l n="112">Too fatally the dire effects will trace ;</l>
     <l n="113">Death oft succeeds the momentary joy ;</l>
     <l n="114">We scarcely good can find without alloy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="115">YOUR servant ; sir , said Nicia with surprise ;</l>
     <l n="116">No more of this : the name will me suffice ;</l>
     <l n="117">Lucretia we will let remain at ease :</l>
     <l n="118">What you propose can never truly please ;</l>
     <l n="119">If I must die by getting of a son ,</l>
     <l n="120">‘ Tis better far the benefit to shun ;</l>
     <l n="121">Go find some other for your wondrous art ;</l>
     <l n="122">In fact I 'm not inclined with life to part .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="123">HOW strange your conduct , cried the sprightly youth :</l>
     <l n="124">Extremes you seek , and overleap the truth ;</l>
     <l n="125">Just now the fond desire to have a boy</l>
     <l n="126">Chased ev'ry care and filled your heart with joy ;</l>
     <l n="127">At present quite the contrary appears</l>
     <l n="128">A moment changed your fondest hopes to fears ;</l>
     <l n="129">Come , hear the rest ; no longer waste your breath :</l>
     <l n="130">Kind Nature all can cure , excepting death .</l>
     <l n="131">What 's necessary pray , that things succeed ?</l>
     <l n="132">Some youthful clod for once should take the lead ,</l>
     <l n="133">And clear the way of ev'ry venom round</l>
     <l n="134">Then you with safety may commence to sound ;</l>
     <l n="135">No time you 'll lose , but instantly begin</l>
     <l n="136">And you 'll most certainly your object win .</l>
     <l n="137">This step is necessary to the end ;</l>
     <l n="138">Some lad of little worth I recommend ;</l>
     <l n="139">But not ill made , nor savagely robust ,</l>
     <l n="140">To give your lady terror nor disgust .</l>
     <l n="141">We know that , used to Nicia 's soft caress ,</l>
     <l n="142">Lucretia would disrelish rude address ;</l>
     <l n="143">Indeed ‘ tis possible in such event ,</l>
     <l n="144">Her tender heart would never give consent ;</l>
     <l n="145">This led me to propose a man that 's young ;</l>
     <l n="146">Besides , the more he proves for action strong ,</l>
     <l n="147">The less of venom will behind remain ,</l>
     <l n="148">And I 'll engage that ev'ry drop he 'll drain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="149">AT first the husband disapproved the plan ,</l>
     <l n="150">The infamy , and danger which they ran</l>
     <l n="151">Perhaps the magistrate might have him sought ,</l>
     <l n="152">And he , of murder , guilty might be thought ;</l>
     <l n="153">The sudden death would mightily perplex ;</l>
     <l n="154">A fellow 's creature 's loss would sorely vex ;</l>
     <l n="155">Lucretia , who 'd withstood each tempter 's charms ,</l>
     <l n="156">Was now to be disgraced in rustick arms !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="157">CALIMACHUS , with eagerness replied ;</l>
     <l n="158">I would a man of consequence provide ,</l>
     <l n="159">Or one , at all events , whose anxious aim</l>
     <l n="160">Would be , aloud the myst'ry , to proclaim !</l>
     <l n="161">But fear and folly would contain the clown ,</l>
     <l n="162">Or money at the worst would stop renown ,</l>
     <l n="163">Your better half apparently resigned ;</l>
     <l n="164">The clod without intention of the kind ;</l>
     <l n="165">In short whate'er arrived , ‘ tis clear your case</l>
     <l n="166">Could not with Cuckoldom be well in place .</l>
     <l n="167">Besides ‘ tis no way certain but our blade ,</l>
     <l n="168">By strength of nerves the poison may evade ;</l>
     <l n="169">And that 's a double reason for the choice ,</l>
     <l n="170">Since with more certainty we shall rejoice :</l>
     <l n="171">The venom may evaporate in fume ,</l>
     <l n="172">And Mandrake pleasing pow'rs at once assume ;</l>
     <l n="173">For when I spoke of death , I did not mean ,</l>
     <l n="174">That nothing from it would the person screen ;</l>
     <l n="175">To-morrow we the rustick lad must name ;</l>
     <l n="176">To-night the potion given your charming dame ;</l>
     <l n="177">I 've some already with me , all prepared ;</l>
     <l n="178">Let nothing of your project be declared :</l>
     <l n="179">You should not seem to know what we 've designed ;</l>
     <l n="180">Ligurio you 'll permit this clod to find ;</l>
     <l n="181">You can most thoroughly in him confide :</l>
     <l n="182">Discretion , secrecy , with him reside .</l>
     <l n="183">One thing , however , nearly I 'd forgot ;</l>
     <l n="184">A bandage for the eyes we should allot ;</l>
     <l n="185">And when well bound he nothing e'er can trace</l>
     <l n="186">Of whom , or what , the lady , or the place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="187">THE whole arrangement Nicia much approved ;</l>
     <l n="188">But now ‘ twas time the lady should be moved .</l>
     <l n="189">At first she thought it jest , then angry grew ,</l>
     <l n="190">And vowed the plan she never would pursue ;</l>
     <l n="191">Her life she 'd rather forfeit than her name :</l>
     <l n="192">Once known , for ever lost would be her fame</l>
     <l n="193">Besides the heinous sin and vile offence ,</l>
     <l n="194">God knew she rather would with all dispense ;</l>
     <l n="195">Mere complaisance had led her to comply ;</l>
     <l n="196">Would she admit a wretch with blearing eye ,</l>
     <l n="197">To incommode , and banish tranquil ease ?</l>
     <l n="198">Who could conceive her formed a clod to please ?</l>
     <l n="199">Can I , said she , the paths of honour quit ,</l>
     <l n="200">And in my bed a loathsome brute permit ?</l>
     <l n="201">Or e'er regard the plan but with disdain ?</l>
     <l n="202">No , by saint John , I ever will maintain ,</l>
     <l n="203">Nor beau , nor clown , nor king , nor lord , nor ‘ squire ,</l>
     <l n="204">Save Nicia , with me freely shall retire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="205">THE fair Lucretia seemed so firmly bent ,</l>
     <l n="206">To father Timothy at length they went ,</l>
     <l n="207">Who preached the lady such a fine discourse ,</l>
     <l n="208">She ceded more through penitence than force .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="209">MOREOVER she was promised that the lad</l>
     <l n="210">Should be nor clownish , nor in person bad ;</l>
     <l n="211">Nor such as any way might give disgust ,</l>
     <l n="212">But one to whom she perfectly might trust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="213">THE wondrous draught was taken by the fair ;</l>
     <l n="214">Next day our Wight prepared his wily snare :</l>
     <l n="215">Himself bepowdered like a miller 's man ,</l>
     <l n="216">With beard and whiskers to complete his plan ;</l>
     <l n="217">A better metamorphose ne'er was seen ;</l>
     <l n="218">Ligurio , who had in the secret been ,</l>
     <l n="219">So thoroughly disguised the lover thought ,</l>
     <l n="220">At midnight him to Nicia freely brought ,</l>
     <l n="221">With bandage o'er the eyes and hair disdained ,</l>
     <l n="222">Not once the husband of deceit complained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="223">BESIDE the dame in silence slid our spark ;</l>
     <l n="224">In silence she attended in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="225">Perfumed and nicely ev'ry way bedecked ;</l>
     <l n="226">For what ? you ask , or whom did she expect ;</l>
     <l n="227">Were all these pains a miller to receive ?—</l>
     <l n="228">Too much they cannot take , the sex believe ;</l>
     <l n="229">And whether kings or millers be their aim ,</l>
     <l n="230">The wish to please is ever found the same .</l>
     <l n="231">‘ Tis double honour in a woman thought ,</l>
     <l n="232">When by her charms a torpid heart is caught ;</l>
     <l n="233">She , who in icy bosoms flame can raise ,</l>
     <l n="234">Deserving doubtless is of treble praise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="235">THE spark disguised , his place no sooner took ,</l>
     <l n="236">But awkwardness he presently forsook ;</l>
     <l n="237">No more the miller , but the smart gallant :</l>
     <l n="238">The lady found him kind and complaisant ;</l>
     <l n="239">Such moments we 'll suppose were well employed ;</l>
     <l n="240">Though trembling fears not perfectly destroyed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="241">SHE , to herself , remarked , ‘ tis very strange ,</l>
     <l n="242">This lad 's demeanour should so quickly change ;</l>
     <l n="243">He 's quite another character , ‘ tis clear ;</l>
     <l n="244">What pity that his end should be so near ;</l>
     <l n="245">Alas ! he merits not so hard a fate ;</l>
     <l n="246">I feel regret the lot should him await ;</l>
     <l n="247">And while soft pleasure seems his heart 's delight ;</l>
     <l n="248">His soul is doomed from hence to take its flight .</l>

     <l n="193">Since one the painter clearly has disgraced ,</l>
     <l n="194">The other equally should be embraced .</l>
     <l n="195">In spite of ev'ry thing you now advance ,</l>
     <l n="196">Your wife as well as mine shall have a dance ;</l>
     <l n="197">A hand I 'll lend , if wanting it be found ;</l>
     <l n="198">Say what you will , I 'll see she has her round .</l>
     <l n="199">She had it then :— our painter tried to please ;</l>
     <l n="200">The lady equally appeared at ease ;</l>
     <l n="201">Full time the others gave , and when they came ,</l>
     <l n="202">More wine was not required by spark nor dame ;</l>
     <l n="203">‘ Twas late , and for the day enough he 'd done ;</l>
     <l n="204">Good night was said : their course the belles had run ;</l>
     <l n="205">The painter , satisfied , retired to rest ;</l>
     <l n="206">The gay gallants , who lay so long distressed ,</l>
     <l n="207">The wily hostess from the closet drew ,</l>
     <l n="208">Abashed , disconsolate , and cuckolds too ;</l>
     <l n="209">Still worse to think , with all their care and pain ;</l>
     <l n="210">That neither of them could his wish obtain ,</l>
     <l n="211">Or e'en return the dame what she procured</l>
     <l n="212">Their wives , whom she so cleverly allured .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="213">HERE ends our tale ; the business is complete ;</l>
     <l n="214">In soft amours success alone is sweet .</l>
    </lg>

   <p>* The Saint Ampoule , or Holy Ampulla , a vial said to have descended from heaven , in which was oil for anointing the kings of France at the coronation , and formerly kept at Rheims .</p>
