   <p>AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE AND WORKS</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>JEAN DE LA FONTAINE .</p>
   <p>There are some writers the facts about whom can never be entirely told , because they are inexhaustible , and speaking of whom we do not fear to be blamed for repetition , because , though well known , they furnish topics which never weary . La Fontaine is one of this class . No poet has been praised oftener , or by more able critics , and of no poet has the biography been so frequently written , and with such affectionate minuteness . Nevertheless , it is certain that there will yet arise fresh critics and new biographers , who will be as regardless as ourselves of the fact that the subject has been so frequently enlarged upon . And why , indeed , should we refuse to ourselves , or forbid to others , the pleasure of speaking of an old friend of our childhood , whose memory is always fresh and always dear ?</p>
   <p>This truly worthy man was born in Château-Thierry , a little town of Champagne , where his father , Charles de la Fontaine , was a supervisor of woods and forests . His mother , Françoise Piloux , was the daughter of a mayor of Coulommiers . An amiable but careless child , he was lazy in his studies , and certainly did not display , by the direction of his earlier inclinations , the germs of his future genius . At twenty years of age , after the perusal of some religious works , he formed the idea that his vocation was the Church , and entered the seminary of Saint Magloire , where , however , he remained only one year . His example was followed by his brother Claude , with this difference , that the latter persevered to the end . On quitting the seminary , La Fontaine , in the paternal mansion , led that life of idleness and pleasure which so frequently , especially in the provinces , enervates young men of family . To bring him back to a more orderly course of life , his father procured him a wife , and gave him the reversion of his office . He was then twenty-six years of age , and the demon of poetry had not yet taken possession of him . La Fontaine never hurried himself about anything .</p>
   <p>The accidental recitation in his presence of an ode by Malherbe aroused in his soul , which had hitherto been devoted to pleasure and idleness , a taste for poetry . He read the whole of Malherbe 's writings with enthusiasm , and endeavoured to imitate him . Malherbe alone would have spoiled La Fontaine , had not Pintrel and Maucroix , two of his friends , led him to the study of the true models . La Fontaine himself has left a confession of these first flights of his muse . Plato and Plutarch , amongst the ancients , were his favourite authors ; but he could read them only by the aid of translations , as he had never studied Greek . Horace , Virgil , and Terence , whose writings he could approach in the original , also charmed him . Of modern authors his favourites were Rabelais , Marot , De Periers , Mathurin , Régnier , and D'Urfé , whose “ Astræa ” was his especial delight .</p>
   <p>Marriage had not by any means fixed his inconstant tastes . Marie Héricart , whom he had been induced to marry in 1647 , was endowed with beauty and intellect , but was unsupplied with those solid qualities , love of order , industry , and that firmness of character which might have exercised a wholesome discipline over her husband . Whilst she was reading romances , La Fontaine sought amusement away from home , or brooded either over his own poems or those of his favourite authors . The natural consequence was , that the affairs of the young people soon fell into disorder ; in addition to this , when La Fontaine 's father died , he left our poet an inheritance encumbered with mortgages , which had been the only means of paying debts , and preserving the family estate intact ; these became fresh sources of embarrassment to our poet , who being , as may well be supposed , anything but a man of business , incapable of self-denial , and unassisted by his wife , soon , as he himself gaily expressed it , devoured both capital and income , and in a few years found himself without either .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine seems to have confined his duties , as supervisor of woods and waters , to simply taking long rambles under the venerable trees of the forests submitted to his care , or to enjoying prolonged slumbers on the verdant banks of murmuring brooks . And that this was the case we may reasonably suppose , since at sixty years of age he declared that he did not know what foresters meant by round timber , ornamental timber , or &lt; i > bois de touche .&lt;/ i ></p>
   <p>His soul was wrapped up in poetry . His first poems were what might be called album verses , and could scarcely have been understood beyond Château-Thierry . These verses , however , obtained so favourable a reception , that at length he ventured to attempt a comedy . But , as the faculty of construction had been denied him , he only &lt; i > adapted &lt;/ i > one of Terence 's plays , changing the names of the characters , and taking certain liberties with the situations . The piece which he had selected , the “ Eunuchus , ” was very unsuited to the boards of the French stage , and he never attempted to get it produced ; but he published it , and it was by means of this mediocre , although neatly versified work , that his name first became known to the public , when he had already entered his thirty-third year .</p>
   <p>It was about this period that one of his relations , J. Jannart , a counsellor of the king , presented the poet to Fouquet , for whom Jannart acted as deputy in the Parliament of Paris . The Surintendant , partial to men of letters , gave La Fontaine a cordial reception , and bestowed upon him a liberal pension . La Fontaine became , not a mere accessory , but one of the most valued elements of the royal luxury of Fouquet 's house , or , rather , court ; and it was through his &lt; i > protégé &lt;/ i >, at a later period , that Fouquet received the only consolation that soothed his disgrace . La Fontaine , established as poet-in-ordinary to Fouquet , received a pension of a thousand livres , on condition that he furnished , once in every three months , a copy of laudatory verses . He was henceforth a guest at a perpetual round of fêtes ; his eyes were dazzled , his heart was moved , and his mind at last awoke . The years which he passed in the midst of this voluptuous magnificence were years of enchantment , of which he has left traces in the “ Songe de Vaux , ” the earliest indication of a talent which was to develop into genius . The first efforts of his muse at this period were laid at the shrine of &lt; i > gratitude &lt;/ i >, but &lt; i > grief &lt;/ i > more happily inspired him , for the “ Elegy to the Nymphs of Vaux , ” the subject matter of which was the disgrace of the Surintendant , raised him to the front rank amongst the masters of his art . Up to this time La Fontaine had been only a pleasant , lively , and ingenious versifier ; but on this occasion he proved himself a true poet , and the lines which we have just named are still regarded as amongst the choicest productions of the sort in the French language . “ La Fontaine did not merely bewail , in the fall of Fouquet , the loss of his own hopes and pleasures , but the misfortunes of the one friend to whom he was gratefully attached , and of whose brilliant qualities he had the highest admiration . The emotion which he expressed was no fleeting one , for , some years afterwards , when passing by Amboise , the faithful friend desired to visit the apartment in which Fouquet had endured the first period of his imprisonment . He could not enter it , but paused on the threshold , weeping bitterly ; and it was only at the approach of night that he could be induced to leave the spot . ”</p>
   <p>Our poet 's success amongst the crowd of brilliant men and distinguished women who formed Fouquet 's court , could never be understood , if we gave full credence to those stories of odd eccentricities , simplicities , and blunders of which he has so frequently been made the hero . It cannot be denied that he was frequently a dreamer , absorbed in his own thoughts , and too apt to be credulous and absent in mind ; but the greeting which was accorded to him , and the eagerness with which his acquaintance was courted in such a place , are sufficient evidences that he could be a charming companion when he pleased . He could be abstracted enough when surrounded by uncongenial spirits ; he opened his heart only to those who pleased him : but on his friends he lavishly bestowed his joyous but refined wit , and his delightful &lt; i > bonhomie .&lt;/ i > The inborn carelessness of his nature rendered him averse to everything like effort ; he was dumb to those who knew not how to touch the keynote of his soul ; to such he was present , indeed , in the body , but his soul was cold and inharmonious . It may even be added , that reverie with him was a species of politeness by which he was wont to conceal his weariness . On such occasions he doubtless fled to the companionship of his fabulous beasts , although he refrained from saying so . Abstraction was to La Fontaine a means of becoming independent , and it is not , therefore , very surprising that he should have allowed people to attribute to him , in an exaggerated degree , a defect which he found so useful .</p>
   <p>Fouquet 's disgrace threw La Fontaine once more into that family life for the earnest and monotonous duties of which he had now grown more than ever unfitted . A son had been born to him , and this might have been supposed to attach him to his home ; but the truth is , that children , whom he has for so many generations amused , were regarded by La Fontaine as his natural enemies , and he never let slip any occasion of expressing this opinion . “ The little people , ” as he called them , were always obnoxious to him . It must be admitted that they are importunate , noisy , ever clamorous for small attentions , and they appear tyrannical to the last degree , in the eyes , at least , of those who have no warm affection for them . And it must also be admitted that La Fontaine was frequently their rival ; for he always desired to be , and was , the spoilt child of the house , the child whose caprices were ever humoured , whose tastes were ever consulted . His life was , indeed , one long period of childhood . He arrived at manhood , became grey , and grew old , without ceasing to be a child ; and to understand him rightly we must remember this fact . It is the key to , and some excuse for , that neglect of all serious duties which we should have to severely blame in him , if we applied to his case the rules of rigorous morality .</p>
   <p>Constituted as he was , La Fontaine would naturally seize every opportunity of quitting his family and that Château-Thierry which he now regarded as a species of tomb . To distract himself from his grief , whilst apparently clinging to it more closely , he followed to Limoges his relation Jannart , who had been exiled by &lt; i > lettre de cachet &lt;/ i > with Madame Fouquet , to whom he served as secretary and steward . Our poet has written a narrative of this journey in a series of letters to his wife , interspersed with pretty verses , and abounding in vivacity . His stay at Limoges was short , and we soon after find him dividing his time between Paris and Château-Thierry , sometimes alone , and sometimes with Madame de La Fontaine , who at first frequently accompanied him in his excursions . The expense of these frequent journeys was naturally calculated to add to the disorder of his affairs ; but he troubled himself little on this score , and it was some consolation that his own property alone was melting away , and that his wife would by-and-by be able to live by herself on property devoted to her own use . Let us also remark , in passing , that he did not altogether neglect that son of his who , at a later period , he describes as a charming boy , in that short and singular interview which has been so frequently discussed , and to whose education he attended until he was relieved of that duty by the generosity of the Procureur-General , De Harlay .</p>
   <p>To this period must be referred his intimacy with Racine , also a “ Champenois , ” and a brother poet — an intimacy which was due to the good offices of Molière , whom La Fontaine had known , and , consequently admired and loved , when residing with Fouquet . His acquaintance with Racine led again to that with Boileau and Molière Chapelle , that incurable promoter of orgies , that wine-bibbing Anacreon , who was always at war with our four poets , especially towards the conclusion of their suppers . Boileau , the Severe , endeavoured sometimes to curb his joyous comrades , but with scant success , and it is on record that on a certain occasion Chapelle got drunk during the course of an impromptu sermon of Boileau 's on the virtues of temperance . Our good friends led a joyous life , which , however , was nearly having a tragic termination , since once , after a dinner at Auteuil , over deep potations of wine , they were led to become philosophic in so melancholy a fashion , that they resolved to drown their several griefs in the Seine , and would have done so , had not Molière happily remarked that it would be more heroic to perform the deed on the morrow . This joyous fraternity soon broke up . Molière was driven away by an ill-judged action on the part of Racine . The royal favour induced Boileau and Racine to become more circumspect ; Chapelle gave himself up to inordinate debauchery ; and La Fontaine , whilst retaining his friendships , went to dream and amuse himself elsewhere .</p>
   <p>Whilst this intimacy lasted , La Fontaine frequently took Racine and Boileau to Château-Thierry , whither he went from time to time to sell a few acres of land , in order to enable him to balance his receipts against his expenditure . The amiable Maucroix , another Epicurean , arrived in his turn to complete the revel which was now carried on at Rheims , to which city he gladly enticed his dear La Fontaine , who desired nothing better than to follow him thither , for , as he has himself told us ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Of all fair cities do I most love Rheims ,</l>
     <l n="2">At once the beauty and the pride of France . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Madame de la Fontaine soon became weary of this life of dissipation , and ceased to follow her volatile husband to Paris . The separation between the spouses was effected , if not without disputes , at any rate without any legal process . Racine frequently urged his friend to become reconciled to his wife , and it was in compliance with such counsels that he made that celebrated journey to Château-Thierry , from which he returned without having even seen Madame de La Fontaine . The anecdote is well known . “ Well , have you seen your wife ? Are you reconciled ? ” “ I went to see her ; but she was in retirement . ” “ Ah ! how charmingly naive ! ” exclaim the biographers ; “ what a delightful illustration of the poet 's habitual &lt; i > bonhomie &lt;/ i > and abstraction ! ” Alas ! it is nothing of the kind . La Fontaine knew what he was about . He had set out in compliance with his friend 's wish , and , in fulfilment of his promise , he had gone to his house door ; but , having found no one at home , he had quietly returned , only too glad that he had redeemed his promise , and avoided an interview which he dreaded . Then , returning to his friends , he put them off with a childish excuse , at which he would not be the last to laugh with all his heart . The whole incident is quite in accordance with the man 's character . His weak resolution induced him at first to yield , but the natural buoyancy of his spirit recovered itself , and triumphed in the end .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine was now more than forty years of age , and , with the exception of his frigid imitation of Terence 's comedy , and his admirable elegy on Fouquet , he had produced nothing which proved that he was anything more than a pleasant and elegant versifier . We must remark , however , that he obtained at this time the position of Gentleman-in-Waiting to the Dowager Duchess of Orleans , widow of Gaston , brother of Louis XIII . The little court of the Luxembourg , at least , if not that of the grand King 's , was thrown open to La Fontaine , and he was received there on terms of the pleasantest intimacy . The office to which he was appointed was not merely honorary , and it justified his acceptance of liberalities of which he was not a little in need . The Duchess of Bouillon also became a patroness of our poet , whom she had met at Château-Thierry ; and he was now engaged by this princess of easy manners and voluptuous disposition , to apply his talents to , the imitation in verse of those somewhat too gallant tales which Ariosto and Boccaccio borrowed from our Trouvères . This advice , eagerly followed , opened up to La Fontaine a new vein of his genius , and threw him upon apologue as one of the means of poetic expression . “ Joconde ” was his first effort in this style ; and this tale , freely rendered from Ariosto , was the cause of a literary discussion , in which Boileau broke a lance in the service of his friend with another imitator against whom La Fontaine was then pitted , and who has since been forgotten : it was like Pradon being compared to Racine . The success of this first effort encouraged the author to make fresh ones , and he speedily produced new tales , as ingenious and indecent as the first . Such fame as Fontaine acquired by these tales must not be dilated on ; for , although there was nothing in the corrupt ingenuity of the pleasant poet that was deliberately vicious , and although he was sincerely astonished that , on account of a few rather free narratives , he should be accused of corrupting the innocence of youth , we must nevertheless hold that the accusation was well founded .</p>
   <p>Recognised and appreciated as La Fontaine 's talents now were , he would doubtless have been the object of some of those distinguishing marks of favour which Louis XIV . was ever ready to bestow upon men of genius , had not his irregular mode of life , and the character of some of his later productions , offended the susceptibilities of the monarch and those of the severe Colbert , the administrator of his liberalities . That La Fontaine should have once been the friend of Fouquet is not sufficient to account for this denial of royal favour , since Pélisson , the eloquent defender of the Surintendant , was himself at this period the object of distinguished royal patronage . The fall of Fouquet was , indeed , so terribly complete and hopeless , that his enemies could well afford to allow his friends to shelter themselves under the cloak of amnesty . To say , as some have done , that La Fontaine was neglected because he belonged to the “ party of the opposition , ” is idle ; for , in the first place , &lt; i > le bonne homme &lt;/ i > had not the courage to resist the majority , and in the second place , there was nothing he more eagerly desired than to be one of the Court poets . Indeed , he seized every opportunity of celebrating the glories of the reign of Louis the Great .</p>
   <p>The real truth is , that he was treated coldly on account of the licentiousness , equally great , both of his verses and his mode of life , at a time when he would merely have had to promise amendment for the future , to have been a participator in the royal benefits , and to have been made a member of the Academy .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine had not a conscience entirely pure , and , accordingly , strove to hide his misdoings under cover of works perfectly irreproachable . Uninvited , he now proposed to himself the task of amusing and instructing the Dauphin , whose education had then commenced . It was an honourable method of paying homage to the Court , and of atoning for past errors . The elegance of Phædrus and the simplicity of Æsop had already fascinated him — he was ambitious of imitating them ; but although thoroughly skilled in the art of narrating , he never suspected that he was about to eclipse his models . He set himself below Phædrus , and Fontenelle has declared that his doing so was one of his blunders — a piquant word , which we may translate in this instance as “ a sincere and even exaggerated admiration for consecrated names . ” A feeling of and a taste for perfection are , moreover , the surest curb-reins to self-love . The playfulness , delicacy , and ingenuity of La Fontaine 's spirit , as well as the natural simplicity of his character , preserved him from the illusions of vanity , and caused him even to misconceive the real value of his genius . It was necessary , then , in the first place , that his true vocation should be revealed to him , and actual fame alone could show that his talent had raised him to the first rank .</p>
   <p>His first collection of fables , arranged in six books , appeared in 1668 , under the modest title of “ Æsop 's Fables : Translated into Verse by M. de la Fontaine . ” The work was dedicated to the Dauphin , and this dedication reveals to us the poet 's secret intention in the publication of the volume . At a later period we find him taking a more direct part in the education of the grandson of Louis XIV ., through the medium of Fénélon . And now , as we have followed so many others in judging of these inimitable compositions , we remark how slowly La Fontaine 's talent developed itself , the better to attain the highest state of maturity . If the poet , on the one hand , careless as to fortune , allowed his patrimony to melt away , let us observe how much time , pure air , and sunlight he has given to the peaceful cultivation of his genius . The tree has been covered with branches , the leaves in due season have adorned them , and then fruits the most delicious have appeared craving to be gathered . Oh , careless great one ! full well had you the right to spurn all vulgar cares ; to devour , as you have said , your capital together with your revenue , since you stored up for yourself another capital , which will give you immortal wealth !</p>
   <p>La Fontaine 's improvidence may be attributed in some degree to his friends , who seem never to have failed him in any necessity . When death had deprived him of the protection of the Duchess of Orleans , he was immediately adopted , so to speak , by the Duchess de la Sablière , whose generosity provided for all his wants , and whose delicate kindness anticipated all his wishes . It was , doubtless , the gratitude with which this lady inspired him , that drew from La Fontaine 's heart those verses , which so many others have since recited in a spirit of bitterness —</p>
   <p>“ Oh , what it is to have a faithful friend , ” &amp; amp ; c .</p>
   <p>And here we have another of those names on which one loves to dwell so fondly . Madame de la Sablière was a genuine patroness of philosophers and men of letters . Her house was always open to them , and her fortune encouraged them to prosecute their labours . Sauveur , Roberval , and Bernier experienced her discreet liberality , which disguised itself only that it might be the more freely bestowed . She loved knowledge , and possessed it without the desire of display ; she had a passion for doing good , yet she employed an innocent art in concealing it . The devotion which she displayed in an unholy love was , for this woman , otherwise so irreproachable , only a transition to those transports of sincere piety which occupied the closing years of her life . La Fontaine was , up to the seventy-second year of his life , the familiar genius of Madame de la Sablière 's mansion , and passed more than twenty years in it in complete tranquillity , at first as one of a most select circle of wits and philosophers , and afterwards as an independent host , doing himself the honours of the house to a rather miscellaneous circle of visitors , which he gathered round him during the prolonged religious seclusions of his patroness , who latterly devoted herself entirely to care for the safety of her soul .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine had no longer any need to secure fresh protectors . His destiny was secured , for , like the rat in the fable ,</p>
   <p>“ Provisions and lodgings ! what wanted he more ? ”</p>
   <p>We may now , therefore , be as tranquil on his account as he was himself , merely observing that he took advantage of this security to deliver himself up with a species of fury to the demon of poetry , which never deserted him . His first fables were received with favour , and when he published others he met with a good fortune which is accorded to but few poets , for even the later ones increased his fame . However , this , his favourite species of writing , had not completely absorbed his attention ; the romance of “ Psyche , ” and some theatrical pieces , occupied his time at intervals . “ Psyche , ” which still amuses us , amused him also much . He worked at it when he wished to rest from other labours , and also at length completed it . The “ Songe de Vaux ” was less happy ; but how could he recall the enchantments and fairy lore of that château where Fouquet had passed the last years of his life in hopeless captivity ? Versailles had surpassed it in magnificence , and La Fontaine employed his descriptive talents in describing the palace whose increasing marvels , which struck every eye , he attached incidentally to the plot of his allegorical fable , already complicated with interlocutors , who may be easily recognised under feigned names as Molière , Boileau , Racine , and La Fontaine . The publication of this romance , of which the prose is elegant , and which also contains many excellent verses , took place soon after that of the first fables . It was received with much favour , and Molière , assisted by Corneille and De Quinault , extracted from it an opera , the music of which was composed by Lulli .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine 's dramatic attempts were , it must be confessed , seldom happy ; but Furetierè certainly exaggerates when he tells us that managers never ventured to give a second representation of his pieces , for fear of being pelted . However this may be , the theatre had a great attraction for La Fontaine , and the society of actors a still greater . When Madame de la Sablière 's drawing-room appeared too serious to him , he would go to amuse himself at Champmeslé 's , and , whilst Racine shaped the talents of this great actress , La Fontaine assisted her husband in the composition of mediocre comedies , in which we can find but few traces of the poet 's skill . It is on this account that he has been made to share the responsibility of the authorship of “ Ragotin , ” a dull imitation of the “ Roman Comique . ” There is little more , indeed , to be said in favour of “ Je vous prends sans Verts , ” which has been attributed to him , and which we may surrender to Champmeslé , who will not gain much , while La Fontaine would certainly lose by it . Of all the pieces put on the stage by Champmeslé , there is only one that we should wish to be able , with a clear conscience , to assign to La Fontaine , and that is “ Le Florentin , ” an amusing little comedy , which contains one scene worthy of Molière . The share which La Fontaine took , or is asserted to have taken , in the composition of these comedies , is difficult to determine . What there can be no doubt of is , that at one time he formed the design of writing a tragedy , and this , perhaps , at the instigation of Racine , who could never refrain from a joke , especially at the expense of his friends . Achilles was the hero selected by our poet ; but he prudently paused after having made a commencement .</p>
   <p>This brings us to the mention of La Fontaine 's one great , solitary , and brief fit of anger . Always ready to yield to the advice of his friends , he imprudently listened to Lulli , who had importuned him to produce , at a very short notice , the libretto of an opera . The music was to be marvellous , the Court would applaud to the skies the author and the composer , and the poet would be free of the theatre , and have acquired all the rights of dramatic authorship . What a temptation was this ! La Fontaine courageously set himself to work under the guidance of Lulli , who urged him forward , and day by day made fresh suggestions . The poet readily obeyed the spur , and even yielded to the sacrifice of some of his verses ; but he had scarcely finished , when he discovered that his perfidious employer had passed over , with all his musical baggage , to the Proserpine of Quinault . We may judge of the poet 's rage . The four months ’ labour utterly lost ; the nights passed without sleep ; the treachery of the instigation ; the heartless abandonment ! Ah ! how many causes of complaint had the poet against this traitor ! La Fontaine could not contain himself , and wrote a satire , compound of gall and bile , in which he complains of having been made a fool of . This fit of passion , however , did not last long . Madame de Thianges brought about a reconciliation between the culprit and the victim , and that without much difficulty , for , after all , Lulli was an excellent companion , and La Fontaine was incapable of nursing anger long . To be angry was a trouble to him , and consequently he never kept up a sense of ill-feeling for any length of time . His friends might become estranged from or quarrel with each other ; but he remained on the best of terms with them , and saw them separately . One might have thought that he had taken for his motto the verse of the old poet , Garnier —</p>
   <p>“ To love I am plighted , but never to hate . ”</p>
   <p>The poetical excursions of La Fontaine out of his own domain added nothing to his renown , and were scarcely perceived amidst the rays of his glory as a fabulist — the title by which he is known to posterity ; and it may be added , that the Fable , as it is fashioned by La Fontaine , is one of the happiest creations of the human mind . It is , properly speaking , a &lt; i > charm &lt;/ i >, as he has said , for in it all the resources of poetry are enclosed in one frame . La Fontaine 's apologue is connected with the &lt; i > épopée &lt;/ i > by the narrative , with the descriptive style by his pictures , with the drama by the play of various personages , and the representation of various characters , and with didactic poetry by the precepts which he inculcates . Nor is this all ; for the poet frequently speaks in his own person . The supreme charm of his compositions consists in the vitality with which they are imbued . The illusion is complete , and passes from the poet who has been first subjected to it , to the spectator , whom it entrances . Homer is the only poet who possesses this characteristic in the same degree . La Fontaine has always before his eyes all that he describes , and his description is an actual painting . His spirit , gently moved by the spectacle which at first it enjoys alone , reproduces it in vivid pictures . That simplicity for which he has been praised exists but in the nature of the images which he has chosen as the best means of representing his thoughts , or , rather , his emotions . Properly speaking , we do not so much read La Fontaine 's fables as gaze at them ; we do not know them by heart , but we have them constantly before our eyes . Let us take as an example “ Death and the Woodman , ” since on this subject two great poets have weakly contended against our fabulist . In this laughable rivalry Boileau and J . B. Rousseau are killed by the spirit of abstraction ; whilst La Fontaine triumphs by means of the image which glows before the eyes and penetrates the heart . If we add to the constant attractiveness of living reality the pleasure caused by the representation of humanity under animal symbols , we shall have before us the two active principles of the universal interest excited by La Fontaine 's fables — I mean &lt; i > illusion &lt;/ i >, which excites the imagination ; and &lt; i > allusion &lt;/ i >, which has a reduplicate action on the mind .</p>
   <p>We do not pretend to assert that there were no French fabulists in France before La Fontaine . The Trouvères were fabulists , and one of the most remarkable specimens of the literature of the middle ages , the “ Romance of the Fox , ” is a genuine study of feudal society , in the guise of personages selected from the animal kingdom . The resemblance of men to animals in this work is complete , and this strange &lt; i > épopée &lt;/ i > derives its interest from the &lt; i > allusion &lt;/ i >, which was so remarkable a characteristic of La Fontaine 's fables . But our poet never drew from this abundant source , and was also unaware that Marie de France in the thirteenth century had adopted , in imitation of Æsop , the simplicity of treatment which he himself had surpassed , and that other poets of the same period had not only treated of similar subjects , but had written verses on them , which he reproduced in the full confidence that they were original . La Fontaine drew his materials directly from the Greek , the Latin , or the Oriental , Æsop , Phædrus , and Pilpay were his models ; but it must be observed that he might have found amongst French writers guides to that perfection which he alone has attained . P. Blanchet , in “ L'Avocat Patelin , ” has inserted the fable of “ The Crow and the Fox , ” to the first of whom he has given the name of Maitre , adopted by La Fontaine . Clément Marot wrote a little drama , full of grace and playfulness , on the subject of the fable of “ The Rat and the Lion ; ” and Régnier has illumined with his genius the oft-told story of “ The Wolf and the Horse . ” La Fontaine knew no other predecessors , amongst modern poets , than the three above mentioned , and he was at no pains to imitate them . In spite of some few scattered similarities between his writings and theirs , La Fontaine was , on the whole , completely original .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine 's originality does not consist solely in the particular bent of his imagination , but also in his language . It is true that his style bears the impress of the purity and elegance of the language of his age , and is characterised by that finish which is common to all the great writers of his time ; but there is also a peculiar richness , suppleness , and naturalness about his idiom . There is , indeed , a Gallic tone in his writings , which is to be found in the works of no other authors of the same period , and which , though derived from old sources , gives to his works a surprising air of novelty . The use of old words and phrases , which he has revived , is a genuine conquest over the lapse of time , and a convenient method of setting forth ideas which would have been unsuited to the over-strained dignity of classic language . Marot , Rabelais , and Bonaventure des Periers , all contributed to enable La Fontaine to make use of the best colloquial language that has ever been employed by any writer ; but La Fontaine 's thefts are never discoverable ; they blend with such exquisite effect with his own ideas , that they seem rather to be reminiscences than robberies . It is in this way that he has robbed the ancients without betraying himself , and that Horace , Virgil , and Plato , even , have furnished him with happy phrases , which have been obdurate to the efforts of all their translators ; phrases which La Fontaine has unconsciously appropriated . His brain took them as they fell in with the current of his thought , and they flowed on with it as though from the same source . Virgil may discover his &lt; i > frigus captabis opacum &lt;/ i > in “ Gouter l'Ombre , et le Frais ; ” Horace , his &lt; i > O ! imitatores , servum pecus &lt;/ i > in “ Quelques Imitateurs sot Bétail , je l'Avoue ; ” and , again , his &lt; i > at nostri proavi &lt;/ i > in “ Nos Aïeux , Bonnes Gens . ” But if either Virgil or Horace were to meet with La Fontaine , they would neither exclaim against him as a traitor nor a thief , but only hail him as a brother poet .</p>
   <p>La Fontaine was permitted to present his second collection of fables to Louis XIV ., and obtained a privilege with respect to its publication which was almost unique ; a eulogium on the work being included in its &lt; i > authorisation &lt;/ i >. Our poet at this period assumed a most discreet air , and out of regard , doubtless , for his patroness , avoided all occasion for scandal . Another , and perhaps a stronger reason was , that he cherished a secret ambition of becoming a member of the Academy . Inspired by this hope , he prevailed on himself so far as to praise Colbert , who had been the vindictive means of the fall of Fouquet . The illustrious fraternity , it must be observed , had given him some intimation that it was willing to elect him , and entreated him to act in such a manner that the election might be unanimous . The goodwill of the Academy was so decided , that , at the death of Colbert , it preferred the fabulist to Boileau , who had the support of the royal favour . But a delay was necessary . The Academy 's choice was neither annulled nor confirmed ; the final decision being delayed until the death of another of the immortals had created a fresh vacancy , and Boileau and La Fontaine entered the Academy side by side ; Boileau as soon as elected , and La Fontaine after a year 's delay . As we have already said , he had performed his purgatory , and Louis XIV . had been willing to believe that he would henceforth be discreet . We shall see , however , that La Fontaine had only strength enough to promise , and that he was a living example of the refrain of one of his most charming ballads —</p>
   <p>“ A promise is one thing — the keeping another . ”</p>
   <p>The desire to become a member of the Academy had been with La Fontaine a passion . He was attracted to the honour as well by his friendship for his comrades as by his love for literature . He rendered himself noticeable by the constancy with which he frequented the Academy , always joining its sittings in time to receive his fee for attendance . One day he was late , and , strict as the rule was , the members present , who knew that this little weekly payment was about all the pocket money their comrade enjoyed , proposed that the rule for that occasion should be relaxed ; but La Fontaine was inflexible . Nevertheless , this act of heroism did not prevent Furetière , in the course of his quarrel with the Academy , from stigmatising La Fontaine as a &lt; i > jetonnier &lt;/ i >. It is well known why this lexicographical abbé , as bilious as reforming grammarians mostly are , entered upon a campaign against his comrades , and how his obstinacy and evil deeds , although he was really in the right , caused his exclusion from the Academy . Fontaine , either through inadvertence or from a feeling of &lt; i > esprit de corps &lt;/ i >, which is more probably the case , had deposited the fatal black ball for the exclusion of his obstinate friend . The consequence was , that Furetière pursued him with implacable animosity , and showered upon the head of the good old fabulist more than his share of epigrams , which were rather venomous than witty . It was the only attack of this sort that La Fontaine had to endure , but it was a particularly sharp one . To style the most inoffensive of men “ a monster of perfidy ” was the slightest of the onslaughts of the rancorous Abbé of Chalivoix . May Heaven preserve us all from the vengeance of soured friends , for there is nothing to equal their venom and malice !</p>
   <p>La Fontaine found himself mixed up in another not less animated Academical quarrel , one in which his opponents did not display so great an absence of courtesy . I refer to the controversy between the ancient and modern schools , which was revived in full Academy by Christopher Perrault . Boileau was as eager in the matter as Racine . La Fontaine enrolled himself in their ranks , with less of partisanship , but equal decision . Thus , the three best instances that the panegyrist of the moderns could have employed in support of his position , were found ranged against him . The turn which the dispute took is singular indeed . Those who were really the rivals of antiquity declared themselves in its favour , while writers of mediocrity , who had much less personal interest in the question than they themselves imagined , proclaimed with fervour the superiority of the moderns . Saint-Sorlin had begun the battle . On Perrault 's signal the weapons were snatched up once more , and Lamotte-Houdard continued the war . Strange champions of progress in letters ! whom the absurdity of the contrast between their pretensions on behalf of their school and the little merits of themselves , its examples , have almost alone saved from oblivion . In fact , the only thing which remains of the least interest in the bulky files of this controversy is our poet 's admirable epistle to the learned Huet , at the time Bishop of Soissons .</p>
   <p>As long as La Fontaine was under the watchful eye of Madame de la Sablière , he was guilty of nothing worse than mere peccadilloes ; but as soon as she had closed her saloon — having been abandoned by the Marquis de la Fare — and had given herself up to the practice of the most austere devotion , the old infant , whom she had left without a guardian , took advantage of his independence precisely as any school-boy might have done . The princes of the house of Vendôme , who amused themselves in the Temple like real Templars , invited him to their festivals , and led him on by their example . Fresh seductions enticed him to an improper indulgence in pleasures suited only to a time of life far different from his own . It is sad to have to record these weaknesses on the part of our poet , but we have , at least , the consolation of knowing that they were expiated by a most sincere repentance .</p>
   <p>A serious illness at length warned La Fontaine that it was time for him to refrain from the pursuit of pleasure , and to contemplate the approach of death . He had never , even in the midst of his wildest dissipation , failed in respect for religion : he had neither insulted nor neglected it . The easy morals of men and women of the world in the seventeenth century were by no means a systematic revolt against religious principles . Such persons were quite conscious that they were offending against that which is right , and had no idea of maintaining the contrary . The most licentious of them intended to repent some day . Where such a tone of feeling prevails , a change of life need not be despaired of . It must be acknowledged that La Fontaine was slow to make such a change ; but when he did make it , he returned completely to that fervent piety which had led him to resolve in his youth to adopt the sacred calling . Racine , who had long since discarded the brief errors of his youth , nursed his friend during this illness , and procured his reconciliation with the Church . It was he , when at the sick man 's pillow , to whom La Fontaine naively proposed to distribute in alms the price which he was to receive for certain copies of a new edition of his “ Tales . ” However , his illness grew daily more serious , and a young vicar of Saint Roch , the Abbé Poujet , was charged with the duty of giving the final direction to Fontaine 's penitence . He found him in the best frame of mind , and La Fontaine not only consented to disavow and apologise for his literary offences before a deputation of the Academy , but also promised , should he survive , to write only on moral or religious subjects ; and , finally , agreed to sacrifice to the scruples of his director , and the Sorbonne , a comedy in verse , which was about to be represented , and which the poet loved as the child of his old age . This sacrifice was truly meritorious , for it was not accomplished without many regrets . No doubt could exist as to the sincerity of his conversion . La Fontaine accordingly received the last sacrament ; and when a rumour was spread abroad that he was dead , it was declared that he had died as a saint . This rumour of his departure , however , was not well founded , for health had returned with peace of soul , and he was yet allowed time to prove , by the rigorous practice of the duties of a Christian , the sincerity of his repentance . Whilst following all the phases of this solemn preparation for death , I am astonished and saddened by the fact that I can behold around the sick man 's couch academicians , clergy , and crowds of friends , but neither wife nor child .</p>
   <p>While the illustrious and henceforth Christian guest of Madame de la Sablière was recovering his health , his patroness had died at the Incurables , to which she had retired . La Fontaine had scarcely regained his health , when he had to leave the mansion which had afforded him an asylum for more than twenty-two years ; he was on the point of quitting it when he met M. d'Hervart , who had come to propose that he should go with him to his hotel in the Rue Plâtrière . La Fontaine 's answer is well known . He accepted the offer .</p>
   <p>“ Which of them loved the other the better ? ”</p>
   <p>It was in this magnificent abode , adorned by the pencil of Mignard , that La Fontaine passed in peace the two years which yet remained to him of life . He still visited the Academy , but he went more frequently to church ; he put a few psalms into verse , paraphrased the &lt; i > Dies Iræ &lt;/ i >, and even yet occasionally found time for the composition of fresh fables . It was in this way that Fénélon was able to give him a share in the education of the young Duke of Burgundy , who furnished subjects which the good old poet put into verse with an infantine delight . The preceptor and his royal pupil rivalled each other in delicate attentions towards the amiable old man , who had not lost by his conversion either his good temper or his wit . Thanks to this high protection , to the vigilance of friendship and the consolation of religion , we shall be able to say , of him when he shall have closed his eyes , “ His end was as calm as the close of a summer day . ”</p>
   <p>La Fontaine passed away gently , after a few weeks of extreme weakness , on the 13th of February , 1695 , in the seventy-fourth year of his age . Racine saw him die with extreme regret , and Fénélon , deeply affected , expressed in exquisite terms the admiration of his contemporaries . Let us quote the last sentences of this brief funeral oration :— “ Read him , and then say whether Anacreon be more gracefully playful ; whether Horace has adorned morality with more varied and more attractive ornaments ; whether Terence has painted the manners of mankind with more nature and truth ; and finally , whether Virgil himself is more touching or more harmonious . ” We shall not seek for any further homage to his genius ; but , as regards his character , we obtain a precious testimony , which has hitherto been unknown to his biographers . On learning of the death of his old friend , Maucroix wrote these touching lines :— “ My very dear and faithful friend , M. de La Fontaine , is dead . We were friends for more than fifty years ; and I thank God that he allowed our great friendship to survive to a good old age without any interruption or diminution , and that I am able sincerely to say , that I have also tenderly loved him , as much at the last as at the first . God , in his merciful wisdom , has thought fit to take him to his own holy repose . His soul was the most sincere and candid that I have ever met with , and was totally free from anything like guile . I believe that he never told a falsehood in his life . ”</p>
   <p>GERUZEZ .</p>
   <p>THE LIFE OF ÆSOP , THE PHRYGIAN .</p>
   <p>We have no certain records concerning the births of either Homer or Æsop ; and scarcely any important circumstance is known respecting their lives : which is somewhat strange , since history readily fathers facts far less interesting and useful . Many destroyers of nations , many ignoble princes , too , have found chroniclers of the most trifling particulars of their lives , and yet we are ignorant of the most important of those of Homer and Æsop — that is to say , of the two persons who have most deserved well of posterity : for Homer is not only the father of the gods , but also of all good poets ; whilst Æsop seems to me to be one of those who ought to be reckoned amongst the wise men for whom Greece is so celebrated , since he taught true wisdom , and taught it with more skill than is employed by those who lay down mere definitions and rules . Biographies of these two great men have certainly been written , but the best critics regard both these narratives as fabulous , and particularly that written by Planudes . For my own part I cannot coincide in this criticism ; for as Planudes lived in an age when the remembrance of circumstances respecting Æsop might well be still kept alive ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>I think it is probable that he had learnt by tradition the particulars he has left us concerning him . Entertaining this belief , I have followed him , suppressing nothing which he has said of Æsop ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>save such particulars as have appeared to me either too puerile or else wanting in good taste .</p>
   <p>Æsop was a Phrygian , a native of a town called Amorium , and was born about the fifty-seventh Olympiad , some two centuries after the foundation of Rome . It is hard to say whether he had to thank or to complain of Nature ; for whilst she gave him a keen intelligence , she also afflicted him with a deformed body and ugly face — so deformed and so ugly , indeed , that he scarcely resembled a man ; and , moreover , she had almost entirely deprived him of the use of speech . Encumbered by such defects as these , if he had not been born a slave , he could scarcely have failed to become one ; but at the same time his soul ever remained free and independent of the freaks of fortune .</p>
   <p>The first master whom he had sent him to labour in the fields , either because he thought him unfitted for anything else , or because he wished to avoid the sight of so disagreeable an object . It happened , on a certain occasion , that this master , on paying a visit to his country house , was presented by a peasant with some figs , which he found so good that he had them carefully locked up , giving directions to his butler , who was named Agathopus , to bring them to him when he should leave the bath . It chanced that Æsop had occasion to visit the mansion at this time , and as soon as he had entered it , Agathopus took advantage of the opportunity to share the figs with some of his friends , and then throw the blame of the theft on Æsop , never supposing that he would be able to defend himself from the charge , as he not only stammered , but appeared to be an idiot . The punishments inflicted on their slaves by the ancients were very cruel , and this was an aggravated theft . Poor Æsop threw himself at his master 's feet , and making himself understood as well as he could , he begged that his punishment might be deferred for a few moments . This favour having been accorded him , he fetched some warm water , and having drunk it in his master 's presence , thrust his finger down his throat . He vomited , and nothing came up but the water as it went down . Having thus proved his own innocence , he made signs that the others should be compelled to do as he had done . Every one was astonished , scarcely believing that Æsop could have devised such a scheme . Agathopus and his companions in the theft drank the water and thrust their fingers down their throats , as the Phrygian had done , and straightway the figs , still undigested , re-appeared with the water . By this means Æsop proved his innocence , and his accusers were punished for their theft and malice .</p>
   <p>On the following day , when the master had set off for town , and Æsop was at his usual work , some travellers who had lost their way entreated him , in the name of hospitable Jove , to show them their right road to the town . Upon this , Æsop first prevailed upon them to repose for a time in the shade , and then , after having refreshed them with a slight collation , became himself their guide , not leaving them until he had put them well on their right road . The good people raised their hands to heaven , and besought Jupiter that he would not leave this charitable act unrewarded . Æsop had scarcely left them , when , overcome with heat and with weariness , he fell asleep . During his slumber he dreamt the goddess Fortune appeared before him , and , having untied his tongue , bestowed upon him that art of which he may be termed the author . Startled with delight at such a dream , he at once awoke , and , leaping up , exclaimed , “ What is this ? my voice is free , and I can pronounce the words ‘ plough , ’ ‘ rake , ’ and , in fact , everything I choose ! ”</p>
   <p>This miracle was the cause of his changing masters , for a certain Zenas , who acted as steward on the estate , and who superintended the slaves , having beaten one outrageously for a fault which did not merit such severe punishment , Æsop could not refrain from reproving him , and threatened to make known his bad conduct . Zenas , with the purpose of anticipating Æsop and avenging himself upon him , went to the master and told him a prodigy had happened in his house — that the Phrygian had recovered the use of speech , but that the wretch only made use of his gift to blaspheme and say evil things of his master . The latter believed him , and went beyond this , for he gave Æsop to Zenas , with liberty to do what he liked with him . On returning to the fields , Zenas was met by a merchant , who asked him whether he would sell him some beast of burden . “ I cannot do that , ” said Zenas ; “ but I will sell you , if you like , one of our slaves ; ” and then sent for Æsop . On seeing Æsop the merchant said , “ Is it to make fun of me that you propose to sell me such a thing as that ? One would take him for an ape . ” Having thus spoken , the merchant went off , half grumbling and half laughing at the beautiful object which had just been shown him . But Æsop called him back , and said , “ Take courage and buy me , and you will find that I shall not be useless . If you have children who cry and are naughty , the very sight of me will make them quiet ; I shall serve , in fact , as a real old bogy . ” This suggestion so amused the merchant , that he purchased Æsop for three oboli , and said to him , laughing , “ The gods be praised ! I have not got hold of any great prize ; but then on the other hand I have not spent much money . ”</p>
   <p>Amongst other goods this merchant bought and sold slaves : and as he was on his way to Ephesus to offer for sale those that he had , such things as were required for use on the journey were laid on the backs of each slave in proportion to his strength . Æsop prayed that , out of regard to the smallness of his stature , and the fact that he was a new comer , he might be treated gently ; his comrades replied that he might refrain from carrying anything at all , if he chose . But as Æsop made it a point of honour to carry something like the rest , they allowed him to select his own burden , and he selected the bread-basket , which was the heaviest burden of all . Every one believed that he had done this out of sheer folly ; but at dinner-time the basket was lightened of some of its load ; the same thing happened at supper , then on the following day , and so on ; so that on the second day he walked free of any burden , and was much admired for the keenness of his wit .</p>
   <p>As for the merchant , he got rid of his slaves , with the exception of a grammarian , a singer , and Æsop , whom he intended to expose for sale at Samos . Before taking them to the market-place he had the two first dressed as well as he could , whilst Æsop , on the other hand , was only clad in an old sack , and placed between his two companions to set them off . Some intending purchasers soon presented themselves , and amongst others a philosopher named Xantus . He asked of the grammarian and the singer what they could do . “ Everything , ” they replied ; on which Æsop laughed in a manner which may be well imagined , and , indeed , Planudes asserts that his grin was so terrible that the bystanders were almost on the point of taking flight . The merchant valued the singer at a thousand oboli , the grammarian at three thousand , and said that whoever first purchased one of the two should have the other thrown in . The high price of the singer and the grammarian disgusted Xantus , but , that he might not return home without having made some purchase , his disciples persuaded him to buy that little make-believe of a man who had laughed with such exquisite grace . He would be useful as a scarecrow , said some ; as a buffoon , said others . Xantus allowed himself to be persuaded , and consented to give sixty oboli for Æsop , but before he completed the bargain demanded of him , as he had of his comrades , for what work he was fitted ; to which Æsop replied , “ For nothing , as his two companions had monopolised all possible work . ” The clerk of the market , taking the droll nature of the purchase into consideration , graciously excused Xantus from paying the usual fee .</p>
   <p>Xantus had a wife of very delicate tastes , who was extremely particular as to the style of persons she allowed to be about her . Xantus knew , therefore , that to present his new slave to her in the ordinary way would be to excite not only her ridicule but her anger . He resolved , accordingly , to make the presentation a subject of pleasantry , and spread a report through the mansion that he had purchased a young slave as handsome as ever was seen . Having heard this , the young girls who waited on the mistress were ready to tear each other to pieces for the sake of having the new slave as her own particular servant ; and their astonishment at the appearance of the new-comer may well be imagined . One hid her face in her hands , another fled , and a third screamed . The mistress of the house , for her part , said that she could very well see that this monster had been brought to drive her away from the house , and that she had long perceived that the philosopher was tired of her . Word followed word , and the quarrel at length became so hot that the lady demanded her goods , and declared that she would return to her parents . Xantus , however , by means of his patience , and Æsop by means of his wit , contrived to arrange matters . The lady resigned her project of insisting upon a divorce from bed and board , and admitted that she might possibly in time become accustomed to even so ugly a slave .</p>
   <p>I have omitted many little circumstances in which Æsop displayed the liveliness of his wit ; for although they all serve as proofs of the keenness of his mind , they are not sufficiently important to be recorded . We will merely give here a single specimen of his good sense and of his master 's ignorance . The latter on a certain occasion went to a gardener 's to choose a salad for himself ; and when the herbs had been selected , the gardener begged the philosopher to satisfy him with respect to something which concerned him , the philosopher , as much as it concerned gardening in general , and it was this : that the herbs which he planted and cultivated with great care did not prove so valuable as those which the earth produced of itself without any thought . Xantus attributed the whole thing to the will of Providence , as persons are apt to do when they are puzzled . Æsop having overheard the conversation , began to laugh , and having drawn his master aside , advised him to say that he had made so general a reply because it was not suited to his dignity to answer such trivial questions , but that he would leave its solution to his slave-boy , who would doubtless satisfy the inquirer . Then , Xantus having gone to walk at the other end of the garden , Æsop compared the garden to a woman who , having children by a first husband , should espouse a second husband who should have children by a first wife . His new wife would not fail to form feelings of aversion for her step-children , and would deprive them of their due nourishment for the sake of benefiting her own . And it was thus with the earth , which adopted only with reluctance the productions of labour and culture , and reserved all her tenderness and benefits for her own productions alone — being a step-mother to the former , and a passionately fond mother of the latter . The gardener was so delighted with this answer , that he offered Æsop the choice of anything in his garden .</p>
   <p>Some time after this a great difference took place between Xantus and his wife . The philosopher , being at a feast , put aside certain delicacies , and said to Æsop , “ Carry these to my loving pet ; ” upon which Æsop gave them to a little dog of which his master was very fond . Xantus , on returning home , did not fail to inquire how his wife liked his present , and as the latter evidently did not understand what he meant , Æsop was sent for to give an explanation . Xantus , who was only too willing to find a pretext for giving his slave a thrashing , asked him whether he had not expressly said , “ Carry those sweet things from me to &lt; i > my loving pet ?&lt;/ i > ” To which Æsop replied , that Xantus 's loving pet was not his wife , who for the least word threatened to sue for a divorce , but his little dog , who patiently endured the harshest language , and which , even after having been beaten , returned to be caressed . The philosopher was silenced by this reply , but his wife was thrown into such a passion by it that she left the house . Xantus employed in vain every relation and friend to endeavour to induce her to return , both prayers and arguments being equally lost upon her . In this dilemma Æsop advised his master to have recourse to a stratagem . He went to the market , and having bought a quantity of game and such things , as though for a sumptuous wedding , managed to be met by one of the lady 's servants . The latter , of course , asked why he had bought all those good things , upon which Æsop replied that his master , being unable to persuade his wife to return to him , was about to wed another . As soon as the lady heard this news she was naturally constrained , by the spirit of jealousy and contradiction , to return to her husband 's side . She did not do this , however , without being resolved to be avenged some time or other on Æsop , who day after day played some prank , and yet always succeeded by some witty scheme in avoiding punishment . The philosopher found his new slave more than his match .</p>
   <p>On a certain market-day Xantus , having resolved to regale some friends , ordered Æsop to purchase the best of everything , and nothing else . “ Ah ! ” said the Phrygian to himself , “ I will teach you to specify what you want , and not to trust to the discretion of a slave . ” He went accordingly and purchased a certain number of tongues , which he had served up with various sauces as entrées , entremets , and so forth . When the tongues first appeared at table , the guests praised the choice of this dish , but when it appeared in constant succession , they became disgusted with it ; and Xantus exclaimed , “ Did I not bid you buy whatever was best in the market ? ” “ Well , ” replied Æsop , “ and what is better than the tongue ? It is the very bond of civilised life , the key of all the sciences , the organ of reason and truth ; by its aid we build cities and organise municipal institutions ; we instruct , persuade , and , what is more than all , we perform the first of all duties , which is that of offering up prayers to the gods . ” “ Ah ! well , ” said Xantus , who thought that he would catch him in a trap at last , “ purchase then for me to-morrow the worst of everything ; the same gentlemen who are now present will dine with me , and I should like to give them some variety . ”</p>
   <p>On the following day Æsop had only the same dish served at table , saying that “ the tongue is the worst thing which there is in the world ; for it is the author of wars , the source of law-suits , and the mother of every species of dissension . If it be argued that it is the organ of truth , it may with equal veracity be maintained that it is the organ of error , and , what is worse , of calumny . By its means cities are destroyed , and men exhorted to the performance of evil deeds . If , on the one hand , it sometimes praises the gods , on the other it more frequently blasphemes them . ” Upon this one of the company said to Xantus , that certainly this varlet was very necessary to him , for he was more calculated than any one else to exercise the patience of a philosopher .</p>
   <p>“ About what are you in trouble ? ” said Æsop . “ Ah ! find me , ” replied Xantus , “ a man who troubles himself about nothing . ” Æsop went on the following day to the market-place , and perceiving there a peasant who regarded all things with the utmost stolidity , he took him to his master 's house . “ Behold , ” said he to Xantus , “ the man without cares whom you have demanded . ” Xantus then bade his wife heat some water , put it in a basin , and wash with her own hands the stranger 's feet . The peasant allowed this to be done , although he knew very well that he did not deserve any such honour , and merely said to himself , “ Perhaps it is the custom in this part of the world . ” He was then conducted to the place of honour , and took his seat without ceremony . During the repast Xantus did nothing but blame his cook . Nothing pleased him . If anything was sweet , he declared that it was too salt , and blamed everything that was salt for being repulsively sweet . The man without cares let him talk on , and meanwhile ate away with all his might . At dessert a cake was placed on the table , which had been made by the philosopher 's wife , and which Xantus scoffed at , although it was in reality very good . “ Behold ! ” cried the philosopher , “ the most wretched pastry I have ever eaten . The maker of it must be burnt alive , for she will never do any good in the world . Let faggots be brought ! ” “ Wait , ” said the peasant , “ and I will go and fetch my wife , so that they may be both burned at the same stake . ” This final speech disconcerted the philosopher , and deprived him of the hope of being able to catch Æsop in a trap .</p>
   <p>But it was not only with his master that Æsop played jokes and found opportunities for witticisms . Xantus having sent him to a certain place , he met on his way a magistrate , who asked him where he was going ; and Æsop , either out of thoughtlessness or for some other reason , replied that he did not know . The magistrate , regarding this answer as a mark of disrespect to himself , had him conveyed to prison . But as the officers were hauling him off , Æsop cried out , “ Did I not give a proper reply ? Could I know that I was going to prison ? ” Upon this the magistrate had him released , and considered Xantus fortunate in having so witty a slave .</p>
   <p>Xantus now began to perceive how important it was for his own interests to have a slave in his possession who did him so much honour . Well , it occurred on a certain occasion that Xantus , having a revel with his disciples , it became soon evident to Æsop , who was in attendance , that the master was becoming as drunk as the scholars . “ The effects of drinking wine , ” said he to them , “ may be divided into three different stages . In the first stage the result is pleasurable emotions ; in the second , mere intoxication ; and in the third , madness . ” These remarks were received with a roar of laughter , and the wine-bibbing went on more furiously than before . Xantus , in fact , got so drunk that he lost all command over his brains , and swore that he could drink up the sea . This declaration , of course , raised a great guffaw amongst his boon companions , and the natural result was , that Xantus , irritated beyond all bounds , offered to wager his house that he would drink up the whole sea , and , to bind the wager , deposited a valuable ring which he wore on his finger .</p>
   <p>On the following day , when the vapours of the wine had evaporated , Xantus was extremely surprised to find that his ring had disappeared from his finger , and with horror learned from Æsop that not only his ring , but his house also , were the forfeitures of the ridiculous wager which he had made over-night . Vexed beyond measure , the philosopher condescended to entreat Æsop to help him out of his difficulty . And this is what came of the Phrygian 's advice . When the day arrived for the decision of the wager , the whole population of Samos rushed to the sea-shore to be witnesses of the philosopher 's defeat ; but , just as one of his disciples who had made the bet with him began to glory in his victory , the philosopher said to the assembled multitude , “ It is quite true that I have bet that I would drink up the whole of the sea ; but I certainly never engaged to drink up all the rivers which flow into it . I must request , therefore , that the gentleman with whom I have made the bet will first prevent the rivers from flowing into the sea . When he has done that , I shall be very happy to fulfil my portion of the wager . ” It need scarcely be said that every one applauded the adroitness with which Xantus had got out of his difficulty . The disciple confessed that he was vanquished , begged his master 's pardon , and Xantus was conducted to his home with great applause .</p>
   <p>As a recompense for this happy hint , Æsop begged for his liberty , which Xantus refused , saying that the moment for Æsop 's freedom had not yet come ; but that if the gods should intimate that it had , he would willingly grant it . If , for instance , he said , two crows should meet his sight on his first leaving the house , he would grant the request ; but that if he should see one only , Æsop should continue to be a slave . Æsop at once went out , whilst his master retired to a neighbouring grove . Our Phrygian had scarcely sallied forth when he perceived two crows caw-caw-ing together upon a lofty branch , and ran to tell his master . Of course , Xantus hastened to see the fact for himself , and before he could reach the spot one of the crows had flown away . “ Ah , ah ! ” said the philosopher to Æsop , “ you are determined to be always cheating me , are you ? Here , you fellows , give this rascal a good horse-whipping . ” This order was at once carried into effect , and whilst the punishment was going on Xantus was invited to a repast , and he sent word to say that he would attend at the time and place appointed . “ Alas ! ” exclaimed Æsop , “ what lies , then , are the forewarnings of heaven ! Here am I , who have seen two crows , suffering the torments of the lash , whilst my master , who has seen but one , is invited to a nuptial feast . ” This sarcasm so pleased Xantus that he gave orders that Æsop should be taken down from the triangles ; but , nevertheless , he could not as yet prevail upon himself to give the Phrygian his often promised liberty .</p>
   <p>One day as the master and man were wandering amongst old monuments , reading with much pleasure the inscriptions , Xantus came to one which he could not understand , although he remained a considerable time trying to explain it . It was composed of the first letters of certain words , and the philosopher avowed that he could not solve the problem which it presented . “ If I help you to find a treasure by means of those letters , ” said Æsop , “ what will you give me ? ” Xantus promised him his liberty and half the treasure . “ They mean , then , ” said Æsop , “ that four paces from this column a treasure lies concealed . ” After having dug for some time they found that such was indeed the case . The philosopher was now called upon to keep his word ; but he still declined to do so . “ May the gods forbid I should set you free , ” said he to Æsop , “ before you have explained the mystery of those letters . To know that will be a greater treasure to me than what we have found . ” “ Well , ” said Æsop , “ they have been engraved here as the first letters of these words , Απόβας Βήματα , &amp; amp ; c .; that is to say , &lt; i > If you step back four paces &lt;/ i > and then dig , you will find a treasure . ” “ As you are so clever , ” said Xantus , “ I should be wrong to part with you ; so give up the idea that you will ever be free . ” “ And I , for my part , ” said Æsop , “ will denounce you to King Denys , for it is to him that the treasure belongs , and these letters are the initials of other words which state the fact . ” The philosopher , alarmed , told his slave to take his part of the treasure and to say nothing about it ; on which Æsop declared that he was under no obligation to him , for that these letters had been selected in such a manner that they contained a triple sense , and signified still further , “ As you go away , you will divide the treasure which you have discovered . ” When they had returned home , Xantus ordered that Æsop should be put in irons and imprisoned , for fear that he should make the adventure known . “ Alas ! ” cried Æsop , “ is it thus that these philosophers fulfil their promises ? But do as you will , Master Xantus , you shall set me free at last in spite of yourself . ”</p>
   <p>This prediction turned out to be true . A prodigy appeared , by which the Samians were greatly frightened . An eagle carried off the public ring ( some seal apparently which was affixed to the proceedings of the Town Council ) , and let it drop into the bosom of a slave . The philosopher was consulted on the matter , both in his capacity as a philosopher and as being one of the Republic . He asked for time , and had recourse to his usual oracle , Æsop . The latter advised him to produce him in public , since , if he succeeded well , the philosopher would have the honour , and if he failed , he , Æsop , would alone bear the blame . Xantus approved of this course , and presented him before the chief assembly of the citizens . As soon as the Phrygian appeared , every one burst into a fit of laughter ; no one supposed that anything sensible could come from the mouth of one so grotesquely formed . Æsop told them , however , that they should not consider the fashion of the vase , but the liquor which it contained ; whereupon the Samians cried out to him to say without fear what he thought of the prodigy . But Æsop excused himself on the ground that he dare not . “ Fortune , ” he said , “ had raised a strife for glory between the master and the slave . If the slave spoke badly , he would be beaten ; and if he spoke better than his master , he would still be beaten . ” Upon this every one pressed Xantus to set the Phrygian free . The philosopher obstinately resisted for some time ; but at length the provost of the town threatened to do so himself , in virtue of his magisterial power . This had the desired effect , and Æsop was set free , upon which he declared the Samians were threatened by this prodigy with being reduced to a state of servitude , and that the carrying off of their ring by the eagle was symbolic of a powerful monarch who was desirous of subjugating them .</p>
   <p>Shortly afterwards Crœsus , King of the Lydians , announced to the Samians that if they did not become his tributaries , he would compel them to do so by force of arms . The greater number were for obeying his commands . Æsop told them that Fortune offered to men the choice of two roads : the one , that of liberty , rough and thorny at the commencement , but afterwards very pleasant ; and the other that of slavery , which at first was easy , but was afterwards very laborious . This was , in effect , plain advice to the Phrygians to defend their liberties ; so they dismissed the monarch 's envoy , unsatisfied as to his demands .</p>
   <p>Crœsus at once made preparations to attack them , but was informed by his ambassador that , as long as they had Æsop amongst them , he would find it difficult to reduce them , such well-grounded confidence had they in that person 's wisdom . Crœsus accordingly sent to the Samians to demand the Phrygian of them ; declaring that , if they would give him up to him , he would respect their liberty . The rulers of the state regarded these conditions as advantageous , and thought that the sacrifice of Æsop would be a cheap means of obtaining peace . The Phrygian , however , made them change this opinion by telling them how the wolves and the sheep , having made a treaty of peace , the latter gave up their dogs as hostages . When they no longer had protectors , the wolves were able to devour them with less trouble than formerly . This fable had its effect , and the Samians then came to a resolution precisely contrary to the one they had just adopted . Æsop , however , was desirous of his own accord of going to Crœsus , and said that he could serve them better if he were with the king than if he remained at Samos .</p>
   <p>When Crœsus saw him , he was astonished that so mean-looking a person had been such an obstruction to his plans . “ What ! ” he cried , “ see what sort of a creature it is that has dared to oppose my will ! ” Æsop prostrated himself , and said , “ A man in pursuit of locusts happened to catch hold of a grasshopper , and was about to kill it , when the insect exclaimed to the man , ‘ What have I done that you should kill me ? I have not devoured your corn ; I have done you no sort of harm . My only peculiarity is a loud voice , of which I make a very innocent use . ’ Ah ! mighty monarch ! I resemble that grasshopper . I only possess powers of speech , and I have not used them to injure you . ” Crœsus , moved with admiration and pity , not only pardoned Æsop , but left the Samians alone on his account .</p>
   <p>It was at this time that the Phrygian composed his fables , which he left with the King of Lydia , when he was sent by the latter to the Samians , who accorded him great honours . He then took it into his head to travel about the world , and to hold high converse with those who were generally regarded as philosophers ; and at length it happened that he obtained an exalted place in the esteem of Lycerus , King of Babylon .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>At this period kings were in the habit of sending to each other problems to solve , on condition that certain tributes should be paid , according as the questions were answered well or ill , on the one side or the other ; and in this sort of game Lycerus , by the assistance of Æsop , rendered himself especially illustrious , whether as proposer or answerer .</p>
   <p>In the course of time Æsop married , and as no children came to him he adopted a young man of noble extraction , named Ennus . The latter rewarded this kindness by ingratitude , and was , indeed , so base as to sully his master 's bed . This having come to the knowledge of Æsop , he drove the rascal from his house , and the latter , in order to be revenged upon him , forged letters by which it was made to appear that Æsop was in the pay of kings who were at enmity with Lycerus . Lycerus , deceived by the apparent genuineness of the seals and signatures appended to those letters , ordered one of his officers , named Hermippus , without seeking any further proofs of the Phrygian 's treachery , to put Æsop to death . This Hermippus , however , being a friend of Æsop 's , saved his life , and secretly fed him for some time in a sepulchre , until Necténabo , King of Egypt , believing in the report of Æsop 's death , thought that he should now be able to compel Lycerus to become his tributary . He commenced provoking him by defying him to send him a man who could build a tower in the air , and who could answer all sorts of questions . Lycerus , having read these letters , and having submitted them to the most able men of his kingdom , found that none of them were prepared to give satisfactory answers , and deeply regretted Æsop . Upon this Hermippus confessed his disobedience of orders , and produced Æsop , who was very well received , and , having proved his innocence of the charge against him , was most graciously pardoned . As for the letter from the King of Egypt , he only laughed at it , and directed Lycerus to reply that he would send the required architects in the spring , and also one who could answer all sorts of questions . Lycerus replaced Æsop in possession of all his property , and at the same time delivered up Ennus to him , to deal with him as he pleased . Æsop received the latter as though he had been his own son , and only punished him by recommending him to honour the gods and his king ; to make himself feared by his enemies ; to render himself useful to others ; to treat his wife well , but at the same time never to trust her with his secrets ; to speak little , and to avoid the company of babblers ; never to give way to misfortune ; to have a care for the morrow , since it is better to enrich one 's enemies by one 's death than to be troublesome to one 's friends whilst living ; and , above all , never to be envious of the happiness or the good qualities of others , since that is but to inflict an injury on ourselves . Ennus , touched by this advice , and by Æsop 's goodness towards him , died soon afterwards , as though he had been stabbed to the heart .</p>
   <p>To return to Necténabo 's challenge . Æsop procured some eagles , and taught them ( a difficult thing to do , but he did it ) to carry each of them a basket in which was a child , and when the spring-time had come , he set off with them , to the great wonder of all the people whom he met who had heard of his design . Necténabo , who had only sent his puzzle because he had heard of Æsop 's death , was greatly surprised as well as greatly disgusted at seeing him . He asked Æsop , however , whether he had brought the architects and the man who could answer all sorts of questions . To which Æsop replied , that the latter was himself , and that the architects should be produced at the proper place . They proceeded to the open country , where the eagles soared up aloft with the children , who cried out to those below to hand them up stones , mortar , &amp; amp ; c. “ You see , ” said Æsop to Necténabo , “ that I have brought you the workmen ; it is for you to supply them with the materials . ” Necténabo acknowledged that in this Lycerus was the conqueror . He proposed , however , this question to Æsop : “ I have mares in Egypt which reply to the neighings of the horses about Babylon . What may that mean ? ” The Phrygian deferred his answer , and returning to his lodging , bade some children take a cat and whip it along the streets . The Egyptians , who worship this animal , regarded this as an extremely scandalous proceeding , and snatching the creature from the children 's hands , went to complain to the king . The Phrygian was at once ordered to the presence , and the king said to him , “ Do you not know that this animal is one of our gods ? Why , then , have you had it treated in this way ? ” “ For an offence which he has committed against Lycerus , ” replied Æsop ; “ for the other night it strangled an extremely courageous cock which crowed at every hour . ” “ You are a liar , ” replied the monarch ; “ how could the cat have made so long a journey in so short a time ? ” “ Just as possible , ” rejoined Æsop , “ as that your mares should hear our stallions neigh at so great a distance . ”</p>
   <p>After this the king had certain ingenious persons brought from Heliopolis , and gave them a great banquet , to which the Phrygian was invited . During the repast they proposed to Æsop various enigmas , and this amongst others : “ There is a vast temple supported on a column , which is surrounded by twelve cities , each of which has thirty buttresses , and around these buttresses walk , one after the other , two women , the one white , the other black . ” “ Such a question as that , ” said Æsop , “ is only fit for little children . The temple is the world ; the column is the year ; the cities are the months ; the buttresses are the days ; around which move , after each other , the day and night . ”</p>
   <p>On the following day Necténabo assembled all his friends , and said to them , “ Is it to be borne that such a pigmy of a man , such an abortion , should enable Lycerus to gain the prize and vanquish me ? ” One of them then advised him to request Æsop to ask them questions about things of which they had never heard . On this Æsop wrote out a memorandum , according to which Necténabo acknowledged that he owed Lycerus two thousand talents . The memorandum was placed sealed in Necténabo 's hands ; and before it was opened Necténabo 's friends declared that the thing which he held in his hands was well known to them . When it was opened , Necténabo exclaimed , “ Behold the greatest falsehood that was ever concocted ! I take you all to witness ! ” “ Certainly , ” they replied ; “ we have never heard of such a thing . ” “ Therefore , ” said Æsop , “ I have satisfied your demand . ” Upon this Necténabo dismissed Æsop , burdened with presents both for himself and his master .</p>
   <p>This residence of Æsop in Egypt may , perhaps , have been the origin of the story that he was a slave there with Rhodope , who , by the aid of the presents made her by her lovers , erected one of the three Pyramids which still exist , and are regarded with such admiration . The legend refers to the smallest of the three , but the one built with the most skill .</p>
   <p>Æsop , on his return to Babylon , was received by Lycerus with great demonstrations of joy and good-will , and had a statue erected to him . His desire , however , to see the world and acquire knowledge , induced him to renounce all honours . He accordingly quitted the court of Lycerus , where he enjoyed everything that could be wished , and took leave of this prince , for the purpose of visiting Greece . Lycerus did not allow him to leave without bestowing upon him the greatest marks of affection , nor without making him swear that he would return to end his days with him .</p>
   <p>Amongst the cities which he visited , Delphi was one of the principal . The Delphians were very willing to listen to him , but they paid him no honours , and Æsop , piqued by this lack of respect , compared them to sticks which float on the water , which at some distance off seem to be something important , but when close at hand are discovered to be worthless . This comparison , however , cost him dear , for the Delphians conceived such a dislike to him , and such a vehement desire of being avenged on him ( as well as being impressed by a fear that he would defame them ) , that they resolved to compass his death . To attain this end , they concealed amongst his goods one of their sacred vessels , intending to accuse him of theft and sacrilege , and then to condemn him to death .</p>
   <p>As Æsop was setting out from Delphi , and journeying towards Phocis , the Delphians ran after him with every appearance of great wrath , and accused him of having stolen their sacred vessel . Æsop denied the theft with solemn oaths , but when his baggage was searched it was found amongst it ; therefore , all that Æsop could say did not prevent them from treating him as an infamous criminal . He was conveyed back to Delphi , loaded with irons , cast into a dungeon , and condemned to be thrown headlong from a rock . It was in vain that , attempting to defend himself with his ordinary weapons , he recited fables . The Delphians only laughed at them .</p>
   <p>“ The frog , ” he said , “ had invited the rat to come to see her . In order to enable him to pass across the pond , she tied him to her foot . As soon as he was fairly on the water she tried to drag him to the bottom , in order to drown him , and then make a meal of him . The unfortunate rat resisted for some little time ; and whilst he was struggling on the surface , a bird of prey perceived him , pounced on him , and having carried him off , together with the frog , who could not extricate herself , made a meal of both . And thus , O Delphians , one more powerful than either of us will avenge me . I shall perish ; but you will perish also . ”</p>
   <p>As Æsop was being led to his place of punishment , he found means to escape , and entered a little chapel dedicated to Apollo , from which , however , the Delphians tore him . “ You violate this asylum , ” he said to them , “ because it is only a little chapel ; but a day will come when your wickedness will find no hiding-place — no , not even in your great temple . The same thing will happen to you that happened to the eagle , which , in spite of the prayers of the beetle , carried off the leveret , which had taken refuge with the insect . The eagle 's offspring was punished for this , even when it had sought shelter in Jupiter 's bosom . ” The Delphians , however , little moved by these remarks , cast Æsop headlong from the rock .</p>
   <p>Soon after Æsop 's death a pestilence spread havoc throughout the Delphian land . The inhabitants asked of the oracle by what means they might appease the wrath of the gods ; the oracle replied , that the only means by which they could do this was by expiating their crime and laying Æsop 's ghost . On this a pyramid was immediately erected to his memory . But it was not Heaven alone that testified its displeasure at Æsop 's murder ; man also avenged the sage 's death . Greece instantly sent a commission to inquire into the circumstances , and inflicted a severe punishment on the criminals .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The chronology of our worthy La Fontaine is here at fault , for between the times of Æsop and Planudes there was an interval of nearly twenty centuries ; Æsop having flourished in the sixth century before Christ , and Planudes having lived in the fourteenth century of the Christian era .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>This life of Æsop , composed by a monk of the fourteenth century , is a legend which has replaced history by disfiguring it . If we confine ourselves exclusively to the testimonies of the ancients , we shall be able to tell in a few words all that has come down to us that is at all likely to be true respecting the life of Æsop . Although various authors have attributed his birth-place in turn to Mesembria in Thrace , to Samos , and to Sardis in Lydia , it is almost certain that he was born in Phrygia , either at Amorium , or in another city of the same province named Cotisium . The deformity which has been attributed to him is simply an exaggeration of a certain ugliness of countenance ; and as he also stammered , he has been declared to have been almost dumb . The first portion of his life was passed in slavery , at first under the Lydian philosopher Xantus , and then under Iadmo at Samos , where he had for a companion the celebrated courtesan , Rhodope . Having been freed by Iadmo , he went to the court of Crœsus , where he enjoyed great favour . Employed by this prince to convey his presents to the temple at Delphi , and certain liberalities to the inhabitants , the perfidy and resentment of the people , whom he had not deemed worthy of his master 's gifts , were the cause of his death . He was accused of having stolen a sacred vase which had been treacherously concealed amongst his goods . Both gods and men avenged his death . His journeys to Babylon and in Egypt are pure inventions . If we may believe Plutarch , he was present at the banquet of the Seven Wise Men at Corinth . The contradictory accounts given by authors as to the place of his birth may be explained by his many journeys ; for he has been said to have been born wherever he resided . It will be seen by this brief sketch , that the life of Æsop by Planudes is not a pure invention , and that we may say with respect to it —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ However great the lie may he .</l>
     <l n="2">Therein some grains of truth we see . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>In the lists of the Kings of Babylon there is found no monarch of this name , and this is another proof amongst many that the life of Æsop by Planudes is a fiction .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The Athenians erected a statue to Æsop , which was the work of the celebrated Lysippus , and it was placed opposite those of the Seven Wise Men .</p>
   <p>DEDICATION</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>MONSEIGNEUR THE DAUPHIN<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>MONSEIGNEUR ,</p>
   <p>If there be anything ingenious in the republic of letters , it may be said that it is the manner in which Æsop has deduced his moral . It were truly to be wished that other hands than mine had added to the fable the ornaments of poetry , since the wisest of the ancients<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>has decided that they are not useless . I venture , Monseigneur , to submit to you certain attempts in this manner , as being not altogether unsuited to your earlier years . You are of an age<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>at which amusements and sports are allowed to princes ; but at the same time you should devote some portion of your attention to serious reflections . This is precisely what we meet with in the fables which we owe to Æsop . At first sight they appear puerile ; but their puerility is only the covering of important truths .</p>
   <p>I do not doubt , Monseigneur , that you entertain a favourable opinion of compositions which are at once so useful and so agreeable ; for what more can one desire than the useful and the agreeable ? It is these that have been the means of introducing knowledge amongst men . Æsop has discovered the singular art of joining the one to the other . The perusal of his works invariably plants in the soul the seeds of virtue , and teaches it to know itself , without letting it feel that it is pursuing a study , whilst , in fact , it even believes that it is otherwise engaged . It is a means of instruction which has been happily made use of by him whom His Majesty has selected as your tutor .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>He teaches you all that a prince should learn in such a manner that you study not only without trouble , but even with pleasure . We hope much from this ; but , to tell the truth , there are things from which we hope infinitely more , and those , Monseigneur , are the qualities which our invincible monarch has bestowed upon you by the mere circumstance of your birth , and the example which he gives you day by day . When you see him forming such grand designs ; when you see him calmly regarding the agitation of Europe and the efforts which it makes to divert him from his enterprises ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>when you see him penetrating by a single effort the heart of one province<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>bristling against him with insurmountable obstacles , and subjugating another<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>within eight days , during that season which is the most hostile of all others to the operations of war , and when the courts of other princes are redolent only of peace and pleasure ; when you see him not content with merely subduing men , but resolved also to vanquish the elements ; and when , I say , on his return from this expedition , in which he has conquered like another Alexander , you see him ruling his people like another Augustus ,— admit , Monseigneur , that , in spite of the tenderness of your years , you sigh for glory as ardently as your father , and that you await with impatience the moment when you will be able to declare yourself his rival in your worship of this divine mistress . But , no ; you do not await it , Monseigneur ; you anticipate it ; and in proof of this I need no other witnesses than that noble restlessness , that vivacity , that ardour , those many evidences of spirit , of courage , of greatness of soul , which you so continually display . It must , doubtless , be the greatest gratification to our monarch , as it is a most agreeable spectacle to the universe , to see you thus growing up , a young plant which will one day protect with its shadow peoples and nations .</p>
   <p>I might enlarge upon this subject . But as the plan I have proposed to myself of amusing you is more suited to my powers than that of praising you , I shall hasten to have recourse to my fables , and will add to the truths I have told you but this — and that is , Monseigneur , that I am , with respectful zeal , your very humble , very obedient , and very faithful servant ,</p>

   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The indulgence with which some of my fables have been received<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>has induced me to hope that this present collection may meet with the same favour . At the same time I must admit that one of the masters of our eloquence<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>has disapproved of the plan of rendering these fables in verse , since he believes that their chief ornament consists in having none ; and that , moreover , the restraints of poetry , added to the severity of our language , would frequently embarrass me , and deprive most of these narratives of that brevity which may be styled the very soul of the art of story-telling , since without it a tale necessarily becomes tame and languid . This opinion could only have been expressed by a man of exquisite taste , and I will merely ask of him that he will in some degree relax it , and will admit that the Lacedemonian graces are not so entirely opposed to the French language , that it is impossible to make them accord .</p>
   <p>After all , I have but followed the example , I will not say of the ancients , which would not affect me in this case , but that of the moderns . In every age , amongst every poetical people , Parnassus has deemed this species of composition its own . Æsop 's fables had scarcely seen the light , when Socrates<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>thought proper to dress them in the livery of the Muses ; and what Plato says on this subject is so pleasant , that I cannot refrain from making it one of the ornaments of this Preface . He says , then , that Socrates having been condemned to death , his punishment was respited on account of the occurrence of certain fêtes . Cébès went to see him on the day of his death , and Socrates then told him that the gods had several times warned him by dreams that he should devote himself to music before he died . He did not at first understand the signification of these dreams ; for , as music does not improve a man 's moral nature , of what use could it be to him ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>It was evident , however , that there was some mystery involved , for the gods never ceased to give him the same warning , and it had come to him again on the occasion of one of the fêtes to which I have above alluded . At length , after having deeply reflected on what it might be that Heaven intended him to do , he concluded that as music and poetry are so closely allied , it probably meant him to turn his attention to the latter . There can be no good poetry without harmony ; but to good poetry fiction is also equally necessary , and Socrates only knew how to tell the truth . At length , however , he discovered a compromise ; selecting such fables as those of Æsop , which always contain something of truth in them , he employed the last moments of his life in rendering them into verse .</p>
   <p>Socrates is not the only one who has regarded fables and poetry as sisters . Phædrus has also declared that he held this opinion , and by the excellence of his work we are able to judge of that of the philosopher . After Phædrus , Avienus treated the same subject in the same way ; finally , the moderns have also followed their example , and we find instances of this not only amongst foreign nations , but in our own . It is true , that when our own countrymen devoted their attention to this species of composition , the French language was so different from what it now is , that we may regard them in this case as foreigners . This has not deterred me from my enterprise . On the contrary , I have flattered myself with the hope that , if I did not pursue this career with success , I should at least earn the credit of having opened the road .</p>
   <p>It may possibly happen that my labours will induce others to continue the work ; and , indeed , there is no reason why this species of composition should be exhausted until there shall remain no fresh fables to put in verse . I have selected the best ; that is to say , those which seem to me to be so ; but , in addition to the fact that I may have erred in my selection , it will be by no means a difficult thing for others to give a different rendering even to those which I have selected ; and if their renderings should be briefer than mine , they will doubtless be more approved . In any case , some praise will always be due to me , either because my rashness has had a happy result , and that I have not departed too far from the right path , or , at least , because I shall have instigated others to do better .</p>
   <p>I think that I have sufficiently justified my design . As regards the execution , I shall leave the public to be the judge . There will not be found in my renderings the elegance and extreme brevity which are the charms of Phædrus , for these qualities are beyond my powers ; and that being the case , I have thought it right to give more ornament to my work than he has done . I do not blame him for having restricted himself in length , for the Latin language enabled him to be brief ; and , indeed , if we take the trouble to examine closely , we shall find in this author all the genuine characteristics and genius of Terence . The simplicity of these great men is magnificent ; but , not possessing the powers of language of these authors , I cannot attain their heights . I have striven , therefore , to compensate in some degree for my failings in this respect , and I have done this with all the more boldness because Quintilian has said that one can never deviate too much in narrative . It is not necessary in this place to prove whether this be true or not ; it is sufficient that Quintilian has made the statement .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></p>
   <p>I have also considered that , as these fables are already known to all the world , I should have done nothing if I had not rendered them in some degree new , by clothing them with certain fresh characteristics . I have endeavoured to meet the wants of the day , which are novelty and gaiety ; and by gaiety I do not mean merely that which excites laughter , but a certain charm , an agreeable air , which may be given to every species of subject , even the most serious .</p>
   <p>It is not , however , by the outward form which I have given it that the value of my work should be alone judged , but by the quality of the matter of which it is composed , and by its utility . For what is there that is worthy of praise in the productions of the mind which is not to be found in the apologue ? There is something so grand in this species of composition , that many of the ancients have attributed the greater part of these fables to Socrates ; selecting as their author that individual amongst mortals who was most directly in communication with the gods . I am rather surprised that they have not maintained that these fables descended direct from heaven ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>or that they have not attributed their guardianship to some one special deity , as they have done in the case of poetry and eloquence . And what I say is not altogether without foundation , since , if I may venture to speak of that which is most sacred in our eyes in the same breath with the errors of the ancients , we find that Truth has spoken to men in parables ; and is the parable anything else than a fable ? that is to say , a feigned example of some truth , which has by so much the more force and effect as it is the more common and familiar ?</p>
   <p>It is for these reasons that Plato , having banished Homer from his Republic , has given a very honourable place in it to Æsop . He maintains that infants suck in fables with their mothers ’ milk , and recommends nurses to teach them to them , since it is impossible that children should be accustomed at too early an age to the accents of wisdom and virtue . If we would not have to endure the pain of correcting our habits , we should take care to render them good whilst as yet they are neither good nor bad . And what better aids can we have in this work than fables ? Tell a child that Crassus , when he waged war against the Parthians , entered their country without considering how he should be able to get out of it again , and that this was the cause of the destruction of himself and his whole army , and how great an effort will the infant have to make to remember the fact ! But tell the same child that the fox and the he-goat descended to the bottom of a well for the purpose of quenching their thirst , and that the fox got out of it by making use of the shoulders and horns of his companion as a ladder , but that the goat remained there in consequence of not having had so much foresight , and that , consequently , we should always consider what is likely to be the result of what we do ,— tell a child these two stories , I say , and which will make the most impression on his mind ? Is it not certain that he will cling to the latter version as more conformable and less disproportioned than the other to the tenderness of his brain ? It is useless for you to reply that the ideas of childhood are in themselves sufficiently infantine , without filling them with a heap of fresh trifles . These trifles , as you may please to call them , are only trifles in appearance ; in reality , they are full of solid sense . And as by the definition of the point , the line , the surface , and the other well-known elements of form , we obtain a knowledge which enables us to measure not only the earth but the universe , in the same manner , by the aid of the truths involved in fables , we finally become enabled to form correct opinions of what is right and what is wrong , and to take a foremost place in the ranks of life .</p>
   <p>The fables which are included in this collection are not merely moral , but are , to a certain extent , an encyclopædia of the qualities and characteristics of animals , and , consequently , of our own ; since we men are , in fact , but a summary of all that is good and bad in the lower ranks of creatures . When Prometheus determined upon creating man , he took the dominant characteristic of each beast , and of these various characteristics composed the human species . It follows , therefore , that in these fables , in which beasts play so great a part , we may each of us find some feature which we may recognise as our own . The old may find in them a confirmation of their experiences , and the young may learn from them that which they ought to know . As the latter are but strangers in the world , they are as yet unacquainted with its inhabitants ; they are even unacquainted with themselves . They ought not to be left in this ignorance , but should be instructed as to the qualities of the lion , the fox , and so forth , and as to the why and the wherefore a man is sometimes compared to the said lion and fox . To effect this instruction is the object of these fables .</p>
   <p>I have already overstepped the ordinary limits of a Preface , but I have still a few remarks to make on the principles on which the present work has been constructed .</p>
   <p>The fable proper is composed of two parts , of which one may be termed the body , and the other the soul . The body is the subject-matter of the fable , and the soul is the moral . Aristotle will admit none but animals into the domain of fabledom , and rigorously excludes from it both men and plants . This rule , however , cannot be strictly necessary , since neither Æsop , Phædrus , nor any of the fabulists<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>have observed it ; but , on the other hand , a moral is to a fable an indispensable adjunct , and if I have in any instances omitted it , it is only in those cases in which it could not be gracefully introduced , or in which it was so obvious that the reader could deduce it for himself . The great rule in France is to value only that which pleases , and I have thought it no crime , therefore , to cancel ancient customs when they would not harmonise with modern ones . In Æsop 's time the fable was first related as a simple story , and then supplemented by a moral which was distinct in itself . Next Phædrus came , who was so far from complying with this rule , that he sometimes transposed the moral from the end to the commencement . For my own part , I have never failed to follow Æsop 's rule , except when it was necessary to observe a no less important one laid down by Horace , to the effect that no writer should obstinately struggle against the natural bent of his mind or the capabilities of his subject . A man , he asserts , who wishes to succeed will never pursue such a course , but will at once abandon a subject when he finds that he cannot mould it into a creditable shape :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>It only remains to speak of the life of Æsop , whose biography by Planudes is almost universally regarded as fabulous . It is supposed that this writer formed the design of attributing a character and adventures to his hero which should bear some resemblance to his fables . This criticism , at first glance , appeared to me sufficiently specious , but I have since found that it has no solid basis . It is partly founded on what took place between Xantus and Æsop , and the quantities of nonsense there contrasted . To which I reply , Who is the sage to whom such things have not happened ? The whole of the life even of Socrates was not serious ; and what confirms me in my favourable opinion is , that the character which Planudes gives to Æsop is similar to that which Plutarch gives him in his Banquet of the Seven Wise Men — that is , the character of a keen and all-observant man . It may be objected , I know , that the Banquet of the Seven Wise Men is in itself a fiction ; and I admit that it is possible to be doubtful about everything . For my own part , I cannot well see why Plutarch should have desired to deceive posterity on this subject , when he has professed to be truthful on every other , and to give to each of his personages his real character . But however this may be , I would ask , Shall I be less likely to be believed if I endorse another man 's falsehoods than if I invented some of my own ? I might certainly fabricate a tissue of conjectures , and entitle them the “ Life of Æsop ; ” but whatever air of genuineness it might wear , no one could rely upon such a work , and , if he must put up with fiction , the reader would always prefer that of Planudes to mine .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Before the year 1668 , when the present collection of fables was first published . Fontaine had already published a few separately , and others had circulated in manuscript .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Patru , a celebrated lawyer , a member of the French Academy , and one of La Fontaine 's friends , who made a strange mistake in trying to divert him from a species of composition which has immortalised him .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>These fables had long been known when Socrates came into the world , and the Father of Philosophy only took the trouble to render them into verse during the imprisonment which preceded his death .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The word Μουσιχὴ implied amongst the Greeks all the arts to which the Muses devote themselves . It comprises the employments of the mind in opposition to γυμναστιχὴ , which means the exercises of the body . La Fontaine does not give Plato 's meaning quite correctly . The philosopher , at the commencement of the “ Phædo , ” makes Socrates say that , having been several times warned in dreams by the gods to study music , he had only regarded it as an encouragement to persevere in the pursuit of truth ; but that , since his imprisonment , he had given another interpretation to those warnings , and had decided that he should better obey the wishes of the gods by making verses .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>The following is the passage in Quintilian to which the poet alludes :— “ Ego vero narrationem , at si ullam partem orationis , omni qua potest gratia et venere exorundam . ” —&lt; i > Quint ., “ Hist Orat . "&lt;/ i > lib . ix ., cap iv .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>La Fontaine has not ventured altogether to repair the oversight of the ancients , for he has left the origin of fables a doubtful point between heaven and earth , when he says , in a dedication to Madame de Montespan , “ The fable is a gift which comes from the immortals ; if it were the gift of man , he who gave it us would indeed deserve a temple . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>The word fabulist was invented by La Fontaine , and has no equivalent either in the Greek or Latin languages . La Motte only ventured to use it under cover of the authority of our poet ; and the French Academy , having declined to admit it into the first edition of its Dictionary , which was published after La Fontaine 's death , only did so when it had been sanctioned by usage and public admiration .</p>

     <l n="1">A Swallow , in his travels o'er the earth ,</l>
     <l n="2">Into the law of storms had gained a peep ;</l>
     <l n="3">Could prophesy them long before their birth ,</l>
     <l n="4">And warn in time the ploughmen of the deep .</l>
     <l n="5">Just as the month for sowing hemp came round ,</l>
     <l n="6">The Swallow called the smaller birds together .</l>

     <l n="16">Who thought themselves , no doubt , immensely clever ,</l>

     <l n="2">“ Goddess , ” he said , “ they justly blame</l>
     <l n="3">The song you 've given to your bird :</l>
     <l n="4">All nature thinks it most absurd ,</l>
     <l n="5">The while the Nightingale , a paltry thing ,</l>
     <l n="6">Is the chief glory of the spring :</l>
     <l n="7">Her note so sweet , and deep , and strong . ”</l>
     <l n="8">“ I do thee , jealous bird , no wrong , ”</l>
     <l n="9">Juno , in anger , cried :</l>
     <l n="10">“ Restrain thy foolish pride .</l>
     <l n="11">Is it for you to envy other 's song ?—</l>
     <l n="12">You who around your neck art wearing</l>
     <l n="13">Of rainbow silks a hundred different dyes ?—</l>
     <l n="14">You , who can still display to mortal 's eyes</l>
     <l n="15">A plume that far outfaces</l>
     <l n="16">A lapidary 's jewel-cases ?</l>
     <l n="17">Is there a bird beneath the skies</l>
     <l n="18">More fit to please and strike ?</l>
     <l n="19">No animal has every gift alike :</l>
     <l n="20">We 've given you each one his special dower ;</l>
     <l n="21">This one has beauty , and that other power .</l>
     <l n="22">Falcons are swift ; the Eagle 's proud and bold ;</l>
     <l n="23">By Ravens sorrow is foretold ;</l>
     <l n="24">The Crow announces miseries to come ;</l>
     <l n="25">All are content if singing or if dumb .</l>
     <l n="26">Cease , then , to murmur , lest , as punishment ,</l>
     <l n="27">The plumage from thy foolish back be rent . ”</l>

     <l n="17">But two days later , though it seems absurd ,</l>
     <l n="18">The simpleton into another hole intruded .</l>
     <l n="19">This second Weasel hated every bird ,</l>
     <l n="20">And darted on the rash intruder .</l>

     <l n="24">I am a mouse — long live the rats ,</l>

     <l n="29">( Boy of fifteen , if I remember well ) ,</l>
     <l n="30">Went one fair day a favourite Ass to sell ;</l>
     <l n="31">To take him fresh — according to wise rules —</l>
     <l n="32">They tied his feet and swung him — the two fools —</l>
     <l n="33">They carried him just like a chandelier .</l>
     <l n="34">Poor simple rustics ( idiots , I fear ) ,</l>
     <l n="35">The first who met them gave a loud guffaw ,</l>

     <l n="30">The Beetle addled all the eggs again .</l>

     <l n="34">The bird that bore off Ganymede ,</l>
     <l n="35">Furious and loud remonstrance made ,</l>
     <l n="36">And flew to Jupiter for aid .</l>
     <l n="37">Her eggs she placed upon the Thunderer 's lap —</l>
     <l n="38">There could come no mishap ;</l>
     <l n="39">Jove must defend them : who would dare</l>
     <l n="40">To touch the objects of his care ?</l>
     <l n="41">The enemy now changed his note ; he soared ,</l>
     <l n="42">And let some earth fall where they 're stored ;</l>
     <l n="43">The god , his vestment shaking carelessly ,</l>
     <l n="44">Let the eggs fall into infinity .</l>
     <l n="45">The Eagle , mad with rage at the event</l>
     <l n="46">( Merely an accident ) ,</l>
     <l n="47">Swore she would leave the wicked court ,</l>
     <l n="48">And make the desert her resort ;</l>
     <l n="49">With such vagaries .—</l>
     <l n="50">( In rage all fair is . )</l>
     <l n="51">Poor Jupiter in silence heard ;</l>
     <l n="52">The Beetle came , and charged the bird —</l>
     <l n="53">In the tribunal of the upper air</l>
     <l n="54">Related the affair .</l>
     <l n="55">The god pronounced the Eagle in the wrong ,</l>
     <l n="56">But still the mutual hate was strong .</l>
     <l n="57">To make a truce , Jove then arranged</l>
     <l n="58">The time for Eagles ’ hatching should be changed</l>
     <l n="59">To winter , when the marmots sleep ,</l>

     <l n="29">What meant their worthy father , then ?</l>
     <l n="30">They run and ask the black-gowned men ,</l>
     <l n="31">Who turn the case for many days —</l>
     <l n="32">Turn it a hundred thousand ways ;</l>
     <l n="33">Yet after all , in sheer vexation ,</l>
     <l n="34">Throw down their wigs in perturbation .</l>
     <l n="35">At last the judge advised the heirs</l>
     <l n="36">At once to settle the affairs .</l>
     <l n="37">As to the widow 's part , the counsels say</l>
     <l n="38">A third each sister 's bound to pay ,</l>
     <l n="39">Upon demand , unless she choose to take</l>
     <l n="40">A life annuity , for quietness ’ sake ,</l>
     <l n="41">Beginning from the day her husband died ,</l>
     <l n="42">And so they all decide .</l>
     <l n="43">Then in three lots they part the whole estate :</l>
     <l n="44">In number one the plate ;</l>
     <l n="45">The mighty cellars ; summer-houses built</l>
     <l n="46">Beneath the vine ;</l>
     <l n="47">The stores of rich Malvoisin wine ;</l>
     <l n="48">The spits , the bowls of silver gilt ,</l>
     <l n="49">And all the tribes of slaves who wait ;—</l>
     <l n="50">In short , the perfect apparatus ,</l>
     <l n="51">That gives an epicure his social status .</l>
     <l n="52">The second lot comprises</l>
     <l n="53">All that a flirting girl surprises :</l>
     <l n="54">Embroiderer 's , and many a lady 's maid ,</l>
     <l n="55">Jewels , and costly robes ;— be sure</l>
     <l n="56">The town house , and the furniture ,</l>
     <l n="57">And stately eunuchs , rich arrayed .</l>
     <l n="58">Lot three comprises farming-stock ,</l>
     <l n="59">Pastures and houses , fold and flock ;</l>
     <l n="60">Labourers and horses , stores and herds .</l>
     <l n="61">This done , they fix , with many words ,</l>
     <l n="62">That since the lottery wo n't select</l>
     <l n="63">What each one would the most affect ,</l>
     <l n="64">The eldest have what she likes best ,</l>
     <l n="65">Leaving the same choice to the rest .</l>
     <l n="66">In Athens it fell out ,</l>
     <l n="67">This pleased the motley rout ,</l>
     <l n="68">Both great and small .</l>
     <l n="69">The judge was praised by all ;</l>
     <l n="70">Æsop alone derided</l>
     <l n="71">The way they had decided .</l>
     <l n="72">After much time and pains , they 'd gone , he thought ,</l>
     <l n="73">And set the wishes of the man at nought .</l>
     <l n="74">“ If the dead came to life , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="75">“ Athens aloud he would upbraid .</l>
     <l n="76">What ! men who cherish subtlety ,</l>
     <l n="77">To blunder o'er a will so stupidly ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">Then quickly he divides ,</l>
     <l n="79">And thus the sage decides :—</l>
     <l n="80">To each he gave the part</l>
     <l n="81">Least grateful to her heart :</l>
     <l n="82">Pressing on them what they most hate .</l>
     <l n="83">To the coquette the cups and bowls</l>
     <l n="84">Cherished and loved by thirsty souls ;</l>
     <l n="85">The toper had the farm ; still worse than that ,</l>
     <l n="86">The miser had the slaves and dresses .</l>
     <l n="87">This is the way , Æsop confesses ,</l>
     <l n="88">To make the sisters alienate</l>
     <l n="89">Their shares of the bequeathed estate ;</l>
     <l n="90">Nor would they longer single tarry ,</l>
     <l n="91">But run post haste , and quickly marry ;</l>
     <l n="92">So very soon the father 's gold , set free ,</l>
     <l n="93">Would to the mother come , with certainty ,</l>
     <l n="94">Which was the meaning of the testament .</l>
     <l n="95">The people wondered , as they homeward went ,</l>
     <l n="96">That he alone should have more brains</l>
     <l n="97">Than all the lawyers and their trains .</l>

     <l n="5">I think with you an author wastes his days ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who tries with over-care his tale to tell ;</l>

     <l n="9">With Æsop 's aim , I simply do my best ;</l>
     <l n="10">And fail — well , just as little as I can .</l>
     <l n="11">Try to instruct by reasoning or jest ;</l>
     <l n="12">No fault of mine if no one likes my plan .</l>
     <l n="13">Rude strength is not by any means my forte ;</l>
     <l n="14">I seek to pelt , with playful ridicule ,</l>
     <l n="15">Folly and vice ; and tease the motley fool</l>
     <l n="16">With stinging missiles — any way , in short ;</l>

     <l n="21">Sometimes I try to paint in fabled guise ,</l>
     <l n="22">A foolish vanity , with envy blended ;</l>
     <l n="23">Two of life 's pivots , mocked at by the wise ,</l>
     <l n="24">In satires long ago , and not yet ended .</l>
     <l n="25">Such , was the miserable creature ,</l>
     <l n="26">Mean and poor in shape , in feature ,</l>
     <l n="27">That tried to puff herself into an ox .</l>
     <l n="28">Sometimes I try , by playful paradox ,</l>
     <l n="29">To pair a vice with virtue , folly with good sense ,</l>
     <l n="30">Lambs with gaunt wolves , the ant to match the fly ;</l>

     <l n="12">He spoke , however , of the things he 'd see :</l>

     <l n="14">The novelties along the marsh 's shore ,</l>
     <l n="15">The score and score</l>
     <l n="16">Of spots of beauty , manners of the races ,</l>
     <l n="17">The government of various places ,</l>
     <l n="18">Some day he would recount with glee</l>
     <l n="19">Unto his youthful progeny ;</l>
     <l n="20">One thing alone the gallant vexed ,</l>
     <l n="21">And his adventurous soul perplexed ;</l>
     <l n="22">He swam but little , and he needed aid .</l>
     <l n="23">The friendly Frog was undismayed ;</l>
     <l n="24">His paw to hers she strongly tied ,</l>
     <l n="25">And then they started side by side .</l>
     <l n="26">The hostess towed her frightened guest</l>
     <l n="27">Quick to the bottom of the lake —</l>
     <l n="28">Perfidious breach of law of nations —</l>
     <l n="29">All promises she faithless breaks ,</l>

     <l n="40">And pounces swift as lightning down .</l>
     <l n="41">The Frog tied to him , by the way ,</l>
     <l n="42">Also became the glad Kite 's prey ;</l>
     <l n="43">They gave him all that he could wish ,</l>

    <head>THE ANIMALS SENDING A TRIBUTE TO ALEXANDER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A Fable current in the ancient times</l>
     <l n="2">Had surely meaning ; but none clear to me .</l>
     <l n="3">Its moral 's somewhere , reader , in these rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="4">So here 's the thing itself for you to see .</l>
     <l n="5">Fame had loud rumoured in a thousand places</l>
     <l n="6">Of Jove 's great son , a certain Alexander ,</l>
     <l n="7">Who had resolved , however sour men 's faces ,</l>
     <l n="8">To leave none free ; moreover , this commander</l>
     <l n="9">Had summoned every living thing beneath the skies</l>
     <l n="10">To come and worship at his sovereign feet :</l>
     <l n="11">Quadrupeds , bipeds , elephants , and flies ;</l>
     <l n="12">The bird republic , also , were to meet .</l>
     <l n="13">The goddess of the hundred mouths , I say ,</l>
     <l n="14">Having thus spread a wide dismay ,</l>
     <l n="15">By publishing the conqueror 's decree ,</l>
     <l n="16">The animals , and all that do obey</l>
     <l n="17">Their appetites alone , began to think that now</l>
     <l n="18">They should be kept in slavery ,</l>
     <l n="19">And to fresh laws and other customs bow .</l>
     <l n="20">They met in the wild desert and decide ,</l>
     <l n="21">After long sittings and conflicting chatter ,</l>
     <l n="22">To pay a tribute , pocketing their pride .</l>
     <l n="23">The Monkey was to manage style and matter</l>
     <l n="24">( Chief of all diplomats in every way ) ;</l>
     <l n="25">They write down what he has to say .</l>
     <l n="26">The tribute only vexed the creatures :</l>
     <l n="27">No money ! how their cash to pay ?</l>
     <l n="28">Well from a prince , who chanced to own</l>
     <l n="29">Some mines of gold , they got a loan .</l>
     <l n="30">To bear the tribute volunteered</l>
     <l n="31">The Mule and Ass , and they were cheered ;</l>
     <l n="32">The Horse and Camel lent their aid .</l>
     <l n="33">Then gaily started all the four ,</l>
     <l n="34">Led by the new ambassador .</l>
     <l n="35">The caravan went on till , in a narrow place ,</l>
     <l n="36">They saw his majesty the Lion 's face ;</l>
     <l n="37">They did not like his look at all ,</l>
     <l n="38">Still less when he began to call .</l>
     <l n="39">“ Well met ; and just in time , ” quoth he ;</l>
     <l n="40">“ Your fellow-traveller I will be ;</l>
     <l n="41">Your toil I wish to freely share ,</l>
     <l n="42">My tribute 's light , yet hard to bear ;</l>
     <l n="43">I 'm not accustomed to a load ; so , please ,</l>
     <l n="44">Take each a quarter at your ease ,</l>
     <l n="45">To you ‘ tis nothing , that I feel ;</l>
     <l n="46">If robbers come to pick and steal ,</l>
     <l n="47">I shall not be the last to fight :</l>
     <l n="48">A Lion is not backward in a fray . ”</l>
     <l n="49">They welcome him , and he 's in pleasant plight ;</l>
     <l n="50">So , spite of Jove-sprung hero , every day</l>
     <l n="51">Upon the public purse he battens ,</l>
     <l n="52">And on good deer he quickly fattens .</l>
     <l n="53">They reach at last a meadow land ,</l>
     <l n="54">With flowers besprinkled , fed by brooks ;</l>
     <l n="55">The sheep feed there on either hand ,</l>
     <l n="56">Unguarded by the shepherd 's crooks :</l>
     <l n="57">It is the summer zephyr 's home .</l>
     <l n="58">No sooner has the Lion come ,</l>
     <l n="59">Than he of fever much complains ;</l>
     <l n="60">“ Continue , sirs , your embassy , ”</l>
     <l n="61">Said he ; “ but burning , darting pains</l>
     <l n="62">Torment me now exceedingly .</l>
     <l n="63">I seek some herb for speedy cure ;</l>
     <l n="64">You must not long delay , I 'm sure ;</l>
     <l n="65">Give me my money ; quick ! I 'm hurried . ”</l>
     <l n="66">Then quickly out the gold was scurried .</l>
     <l n="67">The Lion , quite delighted , cried ,</l>
     <l n="68">In tones that showed his joy and pride ,</l>
     <l n="69">“ Ye gods ! my gold has hatched its brood ;</l>
     <l n="70">And , look ! the young ones are all grown</l>
     <l n="71">Big as the old ones ; that is good :</l>
     <l n="72">The increase comes to me alone . ”</l>
     <l n="73">He took the whole , although he was not bid ;</l>
     <l n="74">Or if he did n't , some one like him did .</l>
     <l n="75">The Monkey and his retinue</l>
     <l n="76">Half frightened and half angry grew ,</l>
     <l n="77">But did not dare reply ; so left him there .</l>
     <l n="78">‘ Tis said that they complained at court ; but where</l>
     <l n="79">Was then the use ? in vain their loud abuse .</l>
     <l n="80">What could he do ? Jove 's royal scion !</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Twould have been Lion against Lion .</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Tis said when Corsairs fight Corsairs ,</l>
     <l n="83">They are not minding their affairs .</l>

     <l n="6">While they thus haggled , churlishly indeed ,</l>
     <l n="7">One bolder than the rest — but wiser ?— no —</l>
     <l n="8">Consents to take it , if Jove only grant</l>
     <l n="9">The climate that he wishes ; he will plant ,</l>
     <l n="10">And sow , and reap , if but the heat and cold</l>
     <l n="11">May come and go , like slaves , as they are told .</l>
     <l n="12">The seasons wait his nod : the wet and dry</l>
     <l n="13">Obey his bidding from a servile sky .</l>
     <l n="14">Jove grants his wish — our foolish fellow sways</l>
     <l n="15">His sceptre bravely — rains and blows for days ;</l>
     <l n="16">Makes his own climate just as he may please :</l>
     <l n="17">His neighbours , no more than Antipodes ,</l>
     <l n="18">Share his good weather . Still as well they fare ;</l>
     <l n="19">Their barns are teeming full ; but his art bare .</l>
     <l n="20">The next year quite a change ; another way</l>
     <l n="21">He sets the seasons , watching day by day :</l>
     <l n="22">Still , there 's some flaw — his crops are thin and poor ,</l>
     <l n="23">While loaded waggons crowd his neighbour 's door .</l>
     <l n="24">What can he do ?— he falls before Jove 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="25">Confesses all his folly : he alone</l>
     <l n="26">Has been to blame . Jove , with much gentleness ,</l>
     <l n="27">Like a mild master , pities his distress .</l>
     <l n="28">It is agreed that Providence is kind ,</l>
     <l n="29">And knows far better than a human mind</l>
     <l n="30">What 's good for us , and calmly bids us do it :</l>

     <l n="6">If we judge only by them without heed ;</l>
     <l n="7">But if we mark the distance and reflect</l>
     <l n="8">On atmosphere and what it will effect ,</l>
     <l n="9">The senses cheat none of us ; Nature 's wise :</l>
     <l n="10">I 'll give an instance . With my naked eyes</l>
     <l n="11">I see the sun ; how large is it , think you ?</l>
     <l n="12">Three feet at farthest ? It appears so , true !</l>
     <l n="13">But could I see it from a nearer sky ,</l>
     <l n="14">‘ Twould seem of our vast universe the eye :</l>
     <l n="15">The distance shows its magnitude , you see ;</l>
     <l n="16">My hand discovers angles easily .</l>
     <l n="17">Fools think the earth is flat ; it 's round , I know ;</l>
     <l n="18">Some think it motionless , it moves so slow .</l>
     <l n="19">Thus , in a word , my eyes have wisdom got ,</l>
     <l n="20">The illusions of the senses cheat me not .</l>
     <l n="21">My soul , beneath appearances , sees deep ;</l>
     <l n="22">My eye 's too quick , a watch on it I keep ;</l>
     <l n="23">My ear , not slow to carry sounds , betrays ;</l>
     <l n="24">When water seems to bend a stick ten ways ,</l>
     <l n="25">My reason helps me out , and if my sight</l>
     <l n="26">Lies always , yet it never cheats me quite :</l>
     <l n="27">If I would trust my senses , very soon</l>
     <l n="28">They 'd tell me of the woman in the moon .</l>
     <l n="29">What is there really ?— No , mistrust your eyes ,</l>
     <l n="30">For what you see are inequalities .</l>
     <l n="31">The surface of the moon has many regions ,</l>
     <l n="32">Here spread the plains , there mountains rise in legions .</l>
     <l n="33">In light and shade strange figures you can trace — -</l>
     <l n="34">An elephant , an ox , a human face .</l>
     <l n="35">Not long ago , in England men perplexed ,</l>
     <l n="36">Saw , in a telescope , what &lt; i > savants &lt;/ i > vexed ,</l>
     <l n="37">A monster in this planet 's mirror fair ;</l>
     <l n="38">Wild cries of horror filled the midnight air .</l>
     <l n="39">Some change was pending — some mysterious change ,</l>
     <l n="40">Predicting wars , or a misfortune strange .</l>
     <l n="41">The monarch came , he favoured learned men ;</l>
     <l n="42">The wondrous monster showed itself again :</l>
     <l n="43">It was a mouse between the glasses shut —</l>
     <l n="44">The source of war — the nibbler of a nut .</l>
     <l n="45">The people laughed — oh , nation blessed with ease ,</l>
     <l n="46">When will the French have time for toils like these ?</l>
     <l n="47">Mars brings us glory 's harvests ; still the foe</l>
     <l n="48">Shrinks down before us , dreading every blow ;</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Tis we who seek them , sure that victory ,</l>
     <l n="50">Slave to our Louis , follows ceaselessly</l>
     <l n="51">His flag ; his laurels render us renowned :</l>
     <l n="52">Yet memory has not left this mortal round .</l>
     <l n="53">We wish for peace — for peace alone we sigh ;</l>
     <l n="54">Charles tastes the joys of rest : he would in war</l>
     <l n="55">Display his valour , and his flag bear far ,</l>
     <l n="56">To reach the tranquil joy that now he shares .</l>
     <l n="57">Would he could end our quarrels and our cares !</l>
     <l n="58">What incense would be his , what endless fame !</l>
     <l n="59">Did not Augustus win a glorious name ,</l>
     <l n="60">Equal to Cæsar 's in its majesty ,</l>
     <l n="61">And worthy of like reverence , may be ?</l>
     <l n="62">Oh , happy people , when will Peace come down ,</l>

     <l n="5">At each wide prospect , hitherto unscanned ,</l>
     <l n="6">He murmured , “ Oh , how beautiful ! how grand !</l>

     <l n="9">For every molehill , to his wondering eyes ,</l>
     <l n="10">Became a mountain of terrific size .</l>
     <l n="11">He reached a province of the land , at last ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where Tethys , deity of seas , had cast</l>
     <l n="13">Some Oysters on the sand , which looked at least</l>
     <l n="14">Like first-rate frigates to our simple beast .</l>
     <l n="15">“ My father is a timid soul , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="16">“ Who fears to travel : what an empty dread !</l>

     <l n="37">It held him fast : the Oyster from his nap</l>
     <l n="38">Had woke , and sharply shut his treacherous trap .</l>
     <l n="39">This all arose from fatal ignorance :</l>
     <l n="40">The fable 's useful to the folks of France ,—</l>

    <head>THE HOROSCOPE .</head>
     <l n="1">A Man will sometimes meet his destiny</l>
     <l n="2">The moment that he turns ill-luck to flee .</l>
     <l n="3">A father had an only son , and dear</l>
     <l n="4">He held him ; so , as love is kin to fear ,</l>
     <l n="5">He with astrologers held a debate</l>
     <l n="6">About the stars that ruled the infant 's fate .</l>
     <l n="7">One of these people said the father 's care</l>
     <l n="8">Should of all lions specially beware .</l>
     <l n="9">Till he was twenty , he should keep him in ,</l>
     <l n="10">And , after that , his safety would begin .</l>
     <l n="11">The cautious father , resolute to save</l>
     <l n="12">His offspring from the ever-yawning grave ,</l>
     <l n="13">Knowing the danger turned on one neglect ,</l>
     <l n="14">Guarded him carefully , in this respect ;—</l>
     <l n="15">Forbad him exit ; barred up every door ;</l>
     <l n="16">But other pleasures lavished more and more .</l>
     <l n="17">With his companions , all the live-long day ,</l>
     <l n="18">He was allowed to walk , and run , and play .</l>
     <l n="19">When he had reached the age that loves the chase ,</l>
     <l n="20">A closer ward they kept upon the place .</l>
     <l n="21">They talked with scorn of all the huntsman 's joys ,</l>
     <l n="22">Spoke of the dangers — mocked the trumpet 's noise .</l>
     <l n="23">But all in vain were sermons , though well meant ;</l>
     <l n="24">Nothing can change the force of temperament .</l>
     <l n="25">The youth was restless , fiery , hot , and brave ;</l>
     <l n="26">The stormy impulses came , wave on wave .</l>
     <l n="27">He sighed for pleasure ;— more the obstacle ,</l>
     <l n="28">The more desire ; in vain they try to quell :</l>
     <l n="29">He knew the cause of all his misery .</l>
     <l n="30">The spacious house , so rich with luxury ,</l>
     <l n="31">Was full of pictures , and of tapestry ,—</l>
     <l n="32">The subjects hunting scenes , and forest glades :</l>
     <l n="33">Here animals , there men , strong lights , dark shades ,—</l>
     <l n="34">The weaver made the lion chief of all :</l>
     <l n="35">“ Out , monster ! ” cried the youth , and eyed the wall</l>
     <l n="36">With foaming rage : “ ‘ tis you that keep me here ,</l>
     <l n="37">In gloom and fetters . Is it you I fear ? ”</l>
     <l n="38">He spoke , and struck , with all a madman 's might ,</l>
     <l n="39">The beast so innocent . There , out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="40">Under the hanging , a sharp nail was stuck :</l>
     <l n="41">It pricked him deeply , by the worst of luck .</l>
     <l n="42">The arts of Æsculapius were in vain :</l>
     <l n="43">He joined the shadows that own Pluto 's reign .</l>
     <l n="44">His death was due to his fond sire 's regard ,</l>
     <l n="45">That in the locked-up palace kept him barred .</l>
     <l n="46">It was precaution , too , that whilom slew</l>
     <l n="47">The poet Æschylus , if they say true .</l>
     <l n="48">It had been prophesied a house should fall</l>
     <l n="49">Upon his head , so he shunned tower and wall ,</l>
     <l n="50">The city left , and camped out on the plain .</l>
     <l n="51">Far from all roofs and danger , he was slain :</l>
     <l n="52">An eagle , with a tortoise in his grip , flew by ;</l>
     <l n="53">The poet 's bald head , from the upper sky ,</l>
     <l n="54">Looked like a smooth boulder ; the bird let drop</l>
     <l n="55">The prey he wished to crush upon the top .</l>
     <l n="56">So perished Æschylus . From hence , we see ,</l>
     <l n="57">The art , if true , led to the misery</l>
     <l n="58">That they would shun , all who in it had trust ;</l>
     <l n="59">But I maintain it 's false , and quite unjust .</l>
     <l n="60">I 'll ne'er believe that Nature ties our hands ,</l>
     <l n="61">Or would submit herself to such vile bands ,</l>
     <l n="62">As in the skies to write our future fate ;</l>
     <l n="63">Times , persons , places , have far greater weight</l>
     <l n="64">Than the conjunctions of a charlatan ,</l>
     <l n="65">Under the self-same planet , tell the man .</l>
     <l n="66">Are kings and shepherds born , though one may sway</l>
     <l n="67">With golden sceptre , and the other play</l>
     <l n="68">With ashen crook ? “ The will of Jupiter , ” —</l>
     <l n="69">A star has not a soul , my worthy sir ;</l>
     <l n="70">Why should its influence affect these two</l>
     <l n="71">So diversely ? How can it pierce through</l>
     <l n="72">That sea of air ,— those cloudy gulfs profound ,</l>
     <l n="73">Mars and the Sun , and pass each fiery bound ?</l>
     <l n="74">An atom would disturb it on its path .</l>
     <l n="75">Horoscope-mongers , let me rouse your wrath :</l>
     <l n="76">The state of Europe ,— who predicted that ?</l>
     <l n="77">Did you foresee it ?— now , then , answer pat .</l>
     <l n="78">Think of each planet 's distance , and its speed ;</l>
     <l n="79">These sage 's passions , it is well agreed ,</l>
     <l n="80">Prevent their judging of our actions right .</l>
     <l n="81">On them our fate depends : a planet 's course</l>
     <l n="82">Goes like our minds , with a still-varying force .</l>
     <l n="83">And yet these fools , with compass and with line ,</l>
     <l n="84">Of men 's whole lives would map out a design !</l>
     <l n="85">But do not let the tales that I repeat</l>
     <l n="86">Weigh in the balance more than it is meet .</l>
     <l n="87">The fate of boy and Æschylus came true ,</l>
     <l n="88">Blind and deceitful though the art be , too .</l>
     <l n="89">Once in a thousand times the bull 's eye 's hit ;</l>

     <l n="2">Ye wise men , listen to my speech .</l>

     <l n="16">Some were indignant ; they , instead</l>
     <l n="17">Of pity , only mockery got .</l>
     <l n="18">The best way was to bear one 's lot ,</l>
     <l n="19">And walk off laughing ; or else go</l>
     <l n="20">Home , and not talk about the blow .</l>
     <l n="21">To ask the meaning of all this</l>
     <l n="22">Was to secure a wise man 's hiss ;</l>
     <l n="23">There is no reason in such folks .</l>

     <l n="26">One of the dupes who took it serious</l>

     <l n="28">Who replied thus at the first view :—</l>
     <l n="29">“ These hieroglyphics I can see ;</l>

     <l n="1">Four animals , of natures various ,</l>
     <l n="2">Living lives the most precarious ,</l>
     <l n="3">Together dwelt , and yet apart ,</l>
     <l n="4">Close to , and e'en within the heart</l>
     <l n="5">Of a most ancient pine .</l>
     <l n="6">The one was Master Cat , who claws ;</l>
     <l n="7">Another , Master Rat , who gnaws ;</l>
     <l n="8">The Weasel third , with waist so fine ,</l>
     <l n="9">And of a very ancient line .</l>
     <l n="10">The fourth was sapient Master Owl ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whose midnight hoot disturbs the ghoul .</l>
     <l n="12">One night , a man about their tree</l>
     <l n="13">A snare disposed with secresy ;</l>
     <l n="14">And Master Cat , at early dawn ,</l>
     <l n="15">From couch with hope of plunder drawn ,</l>
     <l n="16">Scarce half awake , fell plump within</l>
     <l n="17">The cruelly-invented gin .</l>
     <l n="18">Such caterwauling then arose ,</l>
     <l n="19">That Master Gnaw-cheese hurried round</l>
     <l n="20">To see , in fetters safely bound ,</l>
     <l n="21">The deadliest of his special foes .</l>
     <l n="22">Then Master Purrer softly cried ,</l>
     <l n="23">“ Sir Rat , your true benevolence</l>
     <l n="24">Is known in all the country wide ;</l>
     <l n="25">So pray , for pity , take me hence</l>
     <l n="26">From this atrocious , strangling snare</l>

     <l n="30">Have won my heart , and , thank the skies !</l>
     <l n="31">I 've loved you more than both my eyes .</l>
     <l n="32">[ ’ ] Twas just as I was on my way ,</l>

     <l n="35">Within this cursed instrument .</l>
     <l n="36">My life is in your hands , my friend ;</l>
     <l n="37">Pray , with your tooth these , shackles rend . ”</l>
     <l n="38">But curtly then replied the Rat ,</l>
     <l n="39">“ Pray , say what I should gain by that ? ”</l>
     <l n="40">“ My friendship true , for evermore , ”</l>
     <l n="41">The Cat replied . “ These talons grim</l>
     <l n="42">Shall be your guard ; the Owl no more</l>
     <l n="43">Should watch your nest ; the Weasel slim</l>
     <l n="44">Shall never make of you his meat . ”</l>
     <l n="45">“ Not such a fool , ” replied the Rat ,</l>
     <l n="46">“ Am I as to release a Cat ! ”</l>
     <l n="47">And forthwith sought his snug retreat ;</l>
     <l n="48">But near the narrow hole he sought</l>
     <l n="49">The Weasel watched , perhaps meaning nought .</l>
     <l n="50">Still further upward climbed the Rat ,</l>
     <l n="51">To where the great Owl grimly sat ;</l>
     <l n="52">At last , by dangers menaced round ,</l>
     <l n="53">Sir Gnaw-cheese once more seeks the ground ,</l>
     <l n="54">And , working hard with practised grinder ,</l>
     <l n="55">Relieves poor Puss from cords that bind her .</l>
     <l n="56">The task is just completed ,</l>
     <l n="57">When the ruthless man appears ,</l>
     <l n="58">And , overwhelmed with equal fears ,</l>
     <l n="59">The new allies by different paths retreated .</l>
     <l n="60">Soon after this adventure</l>
     <l n="61">The Cat beheld , one sunny day ,</l>
     <l n="62">Snug in a place from cats secure ,</l>
     <l n="63">His friend the Rat , and said , “ I pray ,</l>

     <l n="65">It gives me , on my word , true pain</l>

     <l n="67">My life should deem me still his foe ! ”</l>
     <l n="68">“ And do you think , ” replied the Rat ,</l>

     <l n="10">Pythagoras taught them this law erudite .</l>
     <l n="11">Thus believing , the Brahmin a sorcerer prayed</l>
     <l n="12">That the Mouse might resume some more elegant dress .</l>
     <l n="13">The wise man consented , and , truth to confess ,</l>
     <l n="14">Performed his task well , for the Mouse became Maid ,—</l>
     <l n="15">Ah ! a Maid of fifteen — such an elegant creature ,</l>
     <l n="16">Of a form so genteel , of such exquisite feature ,</l>
     <l n="17">That if Paris had met her , that amorous boy</l>
     <l n="18">Would have risked , to possess her , full many a Troy .</l>
     <l n="19">Surprised at the sight of a being so fair ,</l>
     <l n="20">The Brahmin said , “ Darling , you 've but to declare</l>
     <l n="21">Whom you 'll have for a husband , for none will refuse</l>
     <l n="22">Such a beautiful bride ;— you have only to choose . ”</l>
     <l n="23">Then the Maiden replied , “ I confess that I long</l>
     <l n="24">For a husband that 's valiant , and noble , and strong . ”</l>
     <l n="25">Then the Brahmin knelt down , and addressing the Sun ,</l>
     <l n="26">Cried , “ Noblest of living things , you are the one ! ”</l>
     <l n="27">But the Lord of the Daylight replied , “ ‘ Tis not true</l>
     <l n="28">That I am so strong ; for the Cloud you see yonder ,</l>
     <l n="29">Piled high with the rain , and the hail , and the thunder ,</l>
     <l n="30">Could hide me at once , if he chose , from your view . ”</l>
     <l n="31">To the Cloud , then , appealing , the Brahmin declared</l>
     <l n="32">That with him , Lord of Storms , his child 's fate should</l>
     <l n="33">be shared .</l>
     <l n="34">“ No , No ! ” said the dark Cloud ; “ it never can be ,</l>
     <l n="35">For at each breath of wind I am driven to flee .</l>
     <l n="36">If you 'd have for a son-in-law somebody strong ,</l>
     <l n="37">Your Maid to the North Wind should fairly belong . ”</l>
     <l n="38">Disgusted with constant refusals like these ,</l>
     <l n="39">The Brahmin appealed to the wild , roving Breeze ;</l>
     <l n="40">And the Breeze was quite willing to wed the fair Maid ,</l>
     <l n="41">But a Mountain Top huge his love 's pilgrimage stayed .</l>
     <l n="42">The ball , at this game of “ a lover to find , ”</l>
     <l n="43">Now passed to the Hill , but he quickly declined ;</l>
     <l n="44">“ For , ” said he , “ with the Rat I 'm not friends , and , I know ,</l>
     <l n="45">If I took the fair Maid , he would gnaw at me so . ”</l>
     <l n="46">At the mention of Rat , the fair Maiden , with glee ,</l>
     <l n="47">Cried , “ ‘ Tis Rat , and Rat only , my husband shall be ! ”</l>
     <l n="48">See a Girl for a Rat now Apollo forsaking !</l>
     <l n="49">It was one of those strokes which Love glories in making .</l>
     <l n="50">And , ‘ twixt you and me , such strange instances are ,</l>
     <l n="51">‘ Mongst girls that we know of , more frequent than rare .</l>

     <l n="53">They still show the trace of the place whence they came ;</l>
     <l n="54">And this fable may aid us to prove it ; but yet ,</l>
     <l n="55">On a nearer inspection , some sophistry 's met</l>
     <l n="56">In its traits ; for , to trust to this fanciful story ,</l>
     <l n="57">Any spouse were more good than the Sun in his glory .</l>

     <l n="58">But , what ! shall I say that a giant is less</l>
     <l n="59">Than a flea , because fleas can a giant distress ?</l>
     <l n="60">The Rat , if this rule must be strictly obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="61">Of his wife to the Cat would a present have made :</l>
     <l n="62">And the Cat to the Dog , and the Dog to the Bear ;</l>
     <l n="63">Till , at length , by a sort of a high-winding stair ,</l>
     <l n="64">The story had brought us where first ‘ twas begun ,</l>
     <l n="65">And the beautiful Maid would have married the Sun .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="66">But let us return to the Metempsychosis</l>
     <l n="67">The truth of which , firstly , this fable supposes .</l>
     <l n="68">It seems to me plain that the fable itself</l>
     <l n="69">The system decidedly puts on the shelf .</l>
     <l n="70">According to Brahmin law , animals all</l>
     <l n="71">That inhabit the earth , be they mighty or small ,—</l>
     <l n="72">Be they men , mice , or wolves , or e'en creatures more coarse ,—</l>
     <l n="73">Their souls have derived from one general source ;</l>
     <l n="74">And vary , in physical actions , just so</l>
     <l n="75">As the form of their organs may force them to do .</l>
     <l n="76">And if this be the case , then , how came it that one</l>
     <l n="77">Of so fine-formed a frame did not wed with the Sun ?</l>
     <l n="78">Whereas , as we know , to a Rat she devoted</l>
     <l n="79">The charms on which many a king would have doated .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="80">All things considered , I 'll declare</l>
     <l n="81">That girl and mouse souls different are .</l>
     <l n="82">We must our destiny fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="83">As ordered by the sovereign will .</l>
     <l n="84">Appeal to magic ,— it is all in vain ;</l>
     <l n="85">The soul , once born , will still the same remain .</l>

     <l n="1">Bertrand and Raton — a Monkey and Cat —</l>
     <l n="2">Were messmates in mischief , with roguery fat ;</l>
     <l n="3">There was nothing they feared , there was nothing they spared ,</l>
     <l n="4">And whatever they plundered they usually shared .</l>
     <l n="5">If anything close by was stealable , they</l>
     <l n="6">Would never go foraging out of their way .</l>
     <l n="7">Bertrand stole everything Raton to please ,</l>
     <l n="8">And Raton cared less for the mice than the cheese .</l>
     <l n="9">One day at the fire , when all clear was the coast ,</l>
     <l n="10">The pair were both spying some chesnuts at roast :</l>
     <l n="11">To steal a good meal is its pleasure to double ;</l>
     <l n="12">Besides , it would bring the cook 's man into trouble .</l>
     <l n="13">Says Bertrand to Raton , “ My brother , you see ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fate 's given a moment of glory to thee ;</l>
     <l n="15">Get those chesnuts , and quickly , my brave one , I pray ,</l>
     <l n="16">The gods have vouchsafed us a dinner to-day . ”</l>
     <l n="17">And so to snatch chesnuts poor Raton agreed ,</l>
     <l n="18">And at once set to work on the dangerous deed .</l>
     <l n="19">With gingerly touch he the cinders withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="20">And snatched the hot prizes , first one , and then two .</l>
     <l n="21">He has pilfered quite half , but has not eaten one ;</l>
     <l n="22">The eating his comrade , Bertrand , has done .</l>
     <l n="23">A scullion comes — there 's adieu to the theft —</l>

     <l n="19">The day expired ; he came with faith to see</l>
     <l n="20">If good had come from this festivity .</l>
     <l n="21">To Wolf without the Dog spoke through the gate :</l>

     <l n="27">The caller paused : “ Your servant I remain , ”</l>

     <l n="43">No feeling heart , no self-control ;</l>
     <l n="44">But are like watches , which , set going ,</l>
     <l n="45">Work on , without their object knowing .</l>

     <l n="17">The Cray-fish hurried off without delay ,</l>
     <l n="18">And soon the pool was quivering with dismay :</l>
     <l n="19">Much trouble , much debate . At length was sent</l>
     <l n="20">A deputation to the Cormorant .</l>
     <l n="21">“ Most lordly web-foot ! are you sure th ’ event</l>

     <l n="23">Your kind advice in this our present need ! ”</l>
     <l n="24">The sly bird answered — “ Change your home with speed . ”</l>

     <l n="49">Of sacred life , continuing , said —</l>
     <l n="50">“ Alas ! already I can scan</l>
     <l n="51">How far astray your wits have fled ;</l>
     <l n="52">Your foolish conduct calls to mind</l>
     <l n="53">The story of the traveller blind ,</l>
     <l n="54">Who sees a snake benumbed with cold ;</l>
     <l n="55">The creature frosts so numb and nip ,</l>
     <l n="56">He lies like some old leathern whip ;</l>
     <l n="57">His own just lost , the man takes hold ,</l>
     <l n="58">And waves the reptile in his joy ,</l>
     <l n="59">When one who passes by that way</l>
     <l n="60">Cries — ‘ Heavens ! throw that snake away ,</l>
     <l n="61">Or quickly ‘ twill your life destroy . ’</l>
     <l n="62">‘ No snake ; but a good whip , ’ replied the other .</l>
     <l n="63">‘ No whip ; but snake , ’ replied the stranger ;</l>
     <l n="64">‘ And , pray , should I thus make a pother</l>
     <l n="65">Unless I saw your woful danger ?</l>
     <l n="66">And will you really keep that thing ,</l>
     <l n="67">With fangs so sharp , and deadly sting ? ’</l>
     <l n="68">‘ Of course , I shall ; my whip was lost ,</l>
     <l n="69">And this will save another 's cost .</l>
     <l n="70">You speak from envy — sir , good-bye . ’</l>
     <l n="71">The snake , now brandished wide and high ,</l>
     <l n="72">Grew warm and warmer gradually ,</l>
     <l n="73">And , stinging , caused the fool to die .</l>
     <l n="74">But , as for you , my satrap friend ,</l>
     <l n="75">You hasten to a bitterer end . ”</l>
     <l n="76">“ What ! worse than death ? ” the satrap cried .</l>
     <l n="77">“ Ah ! worse than death , ” the sage replied .</l>
     <l n="78">And , in due time , the hermit 's word</l>
     <l n="79">Was proved with truth in due accord ;</l>
     <l n="80">For all the pests that haunt a Court ,</l>
     <l n="81">By hint and wink , and false report ,</l>
     <l n="82">Soon made the satrap 's virtuous skill</l>
     <l n="83">Seem to his royal master ill .</l>
     <l n="84">Cabals arose on every side ;</l>
     <l n="85">Defeated suitors loudly cried ,</l>
     <l n="86">“ With what belonged to us he built that palace wide . ”</l>
     <l n="87">The Monarch fain would see this wealth ,</l>
     <l n="88">And thither stole one day by stealth ,</l>
     <l n="89">But nought within it met his eyes</l>
     <l n="90">Save modest mediocrities ,</l>
     <l n="91">And praises of the joys that lie</l>
     <l n="92">In loneliness and poverty .</l>
     <l n="93">“ His wealth , then , ” cried the pests , “ consists</l>
     <l n="94">In diamonds , pearls , and amethysts ;</l>

     <l n="97">The Monarch , with his own white hands ,</l>
     <l n="98">Undoes the locks and clumsy bands ,</l>
     <l n="99">Throws back the wooden lid — and mute</l>

     <l n="101">For in that oaken chest is nought</l>
     <l n="102">But cap and jacket , roughly wrought ,</l>
     <l n="103">A simple cloak , a shepherd 's flute .</l>
     <l n="104">“ Ah ! much-loved treasures ; ” then exclaims</l>
     <l n="105">The Shepherd ; “ you are dear , indeed ,</l>

     <l n="107">Or malice of my fellow-men ,</l>
     <l n="108">And you your master now reclaims ;</l>
     <l n="109">Let 's leave this palace , ne'er again</l>
     <l n="110">To enter , save in airy vision .</l>

     <l n="13">To show that he with justice acted ,</l>
     <l n="14">His reasons in these words compacted :—</l>

     <l n="5">Two Ducks , to whom our friend repaired</l>
     <l n="6">To gossip o'er her bold intent ,</l>
     <l n="7">Their full approval straight declared ;</l>
     <l n="8">And , pointing to the firmament ,</l>
     <l n="9">Said , “ By that road — ‘ tis broad and ample —</l>

     <l n="15">The Tortoise liking much this plan ,</l>
     <l n="16">Straightway the friendly Ducks began</l>
     <l n="17">To see how one for flight unfitted</l>
     <l n="18">Might through the realms of air be flitted .</l>
     <l n="19">At length within her jaws they fitted</l>
     <l n="20">A trusty stick , and seizing each an end ,</l>
     <l n="21">With many a warning cry — “ Hold fast ! hold fast ! ”</l>
     <l n="22">Bore up to heaven their adventurous friend .</l>
     <l n="23">The people wondered as the cortège passed ,</l>
     <l n="24">And truly it was droll to see</l>
     <l n="25">A Tortoise and her house in the Ducks ’ company .</l>
     <l n="26">“ A miracle ! ” the wondering mob surprises :</l>
     <l n="27">“ Behold , on clouds the great Queen Tortoise rises ! ”</l>
     <l n="28">“ A queen ! ” the Tortoise answered ; “ yes , forsooth ;</l>
     <l n="29">Make no mistake — I am — in honest truth . ”</l>
     <l n="30">Alas ! why did she speak ? She was a chattering dunce :</l>
     <l n="31">For as her jaws unclose , the stick slips out at once ,</l>
     <l n="32">And down amidst the gaping crowds she sank ,</l>
     <l n="33">A wretched victim to her claims to rank .</l>
     <l n="34">Self-pride , a love of idle speaking ,</l>
     <l n="35">And wish to be for ever seeking</l>
     <l n="36">A power that Nature ne'er intended ,</l>
     <l n="37">Are follies close allied , and from one stock descended .</l>

     <l n="4">Mortal heroes unto glory ;</l>

     <l n="7">However , once , by Talisman</l>
     <l n="8">Induced , a knight conceived the plan</l>
     <l n="9">Of mounting horse and couching lance ,</l>
     <l n="10">And seeking lands of fair romance ,</l>
     <l n="11">Accompanied by one he knew .</l>
     <l n="12">After a time there came in view</l>
     <l n="13">A post upon the public way ,</l>

     <l n="15">Adventurous knight . If you would see</l>

     <l n="20">Raise up , and , without resting , bear</l>
     <l n="21">To yonder mountain 's crest , which proudly stands alone . ”</l>
     <l n="22">Now of these knights one was of those</l>
     <l n="23">Who shudder at your swashing blows .</l>
     <l n="24">“ The torrent 's deep and broad , ” he cried ;</l>
     <l n="25">“ And if we reach the other side ?</l>
     <l n="26">Why climb unto a mountain 's crest ,</l>

     <l n="32">Bear it to yonder mountain 's top ,</l>
     <l n="33">Not daring once for breath to stay .</l>
     <l n="34">Perhaps this mystic head is naught</l>
     <l n="35">But such as one might bear away ;</l>
     <l n="36">And if the latter be the truth ,</l>
     <l n="37">Success were honour small , in sooth .</l>

     <l n="40">This wise man having passed along ,</l>
     <l n="41">The other crossed his breast , and made</l>
     <l n="42">A dash across the torrent strong ,</l>
     <l n="43">And found beneath the tree the beast 's head laid .</l>
     <l n="44">He raised it , and , with breathless stride ,</l>
     <l n="45">He bore it to the mountain 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="46">And there , upon a terrace wide ,</l>
     <l n="47">Gazed on a city fair that stretched below .</l>
     <l n="48">“ Umph ! ” cried the elephant , and then</l>
     <l n="49">Forth swarmed a host of armed men .</l>
     <l n="50">All other errant knights but this</l>
     <l n="51">Would now have shown some cowardice ;</l>

     <l n="55">When all the crowd , with joyful cries ,</l>
     <l n="56">Proclaimed him monarch , in the place</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A Miser once who 'd got much money ,</l>
     <l n="2">Was puzzled how to hide that honey ;</l>
     <l n="3">For ignorance and love of gain</l>
     <l n="4">Being ever sisters twain ,</l>
     <l n="5">Had left him at a total loss</l>
     <l n="6">Where to secrete his golden dross ;</l>
     <l n="7">And why the Miser was so hot to find</l>
     <l n="8">A place of safety for his hoarded pelf ,</l>
     <l n="9">Was simply the great fear that filled his mind ,</l>
     <l n="10">That some day he should spend and rob himself :</l>
     <l n="11">Yes , rob himself by gathering pleasure</l>
     <l n="12">From the usage of his treasure .</l>
     <l n="13">Poor Miser ! how I pity your mistake !</l>
     <l n="14">Wealth is not wealth unless we use it ,</l>
     <l n="15">And when we do not we abuse it .</l>
     <l n="16">Why keep money till the sense</l>
     <l n="17">Of pleasure dies in impotence ?</l>
     <l n="18">To gather gold alone is wretched slaving ;</l>
     <l n="19">To have to watch it makes it not worth having .</l>
     <l n="20">However this may be , our Miser might</l>
     <l n="21">Have found some trusty banker for his gold ;</l>
     <l n="22">But it seemed better , to his purblind sight ,</l>
     <l n="23">To give it to the depths of earth to hold .</l>
     <l n="24">So with a comrade 's aid</l>
     <l n="25">It soon beneath the turf was laid ;</l>
     <l n="26">But when a little time was past ,</l>
     <l n="27">Our Miser going to re-visit</l>
     <l n="28">His buried treasure , found a huge deficit .</l>
     <l n="29">At first despair oppressed him ; but at last</l>
     <l n="30">He hurried to his comrade , and he said —</l>
     <l n="31">“ To-morrow I shall want your help again ;</l>
     <l n="32">Some bags of gold still in my house remain ,</l>
     <l n="33">And they had better with the rest be laid . ”</l>
     <l n="34">The comrade immediately hurried away ,</l>
     <l n="35">And returned all the gold he had taken ,</l>
     <l n="36">Intending to grasp the whole lot the next day ;</l>
     <l n="37">But in this he was somewhat mistaken ;</l>
     <l n="38">For the Miser grown wise by the loss of his store ,</l>
     <l n="39">Resolved ‘ neath the earth to conceal it no more ,</l>
     <l n="40">But to use and enjoy it ; and thus the poor thief ,</l>

     <l n="9">In England long since a price paid for my head ,</l>

     <l n="17">Which never leaves the Wolf at rest ?</l>

     <l n="23">Or starve and die — a cruel , cruel fate —</l>
     <l n="24">Sooner than be a thing of universal hate . ”</l>
     <l n="25">Saying these words , a pleasant savour drew</l>
     <l n="26">Our wolf 's attention to some shepherds near ,</l>
     <l n="27">Feasting on what his wolfish instinct knew</l>
     <l n="28">Had once been lambkin , to some mother dear .</l>
     <l n="29">“ Ah , ah ! ” he exclaimed , “ this is strange , by my troth ;</l>
     <l n="30">I 'm reproaching myself for each lamb that I 've slain ,</l>
     <l n="31">Whilst the shepherds and sheep-dogs themselves are not loth</l>
     <l n="32">To regale on roast lamb is abundantly plain ;</l>
     <l n="33">And shall I , then , a Wolf , feed on nothing but grass ?</l>
     <l n="34">No , not if I know it ! The day shall not pass</l>
     <l n="35">Till a lambkin has gone down my cavernous jaws ,</l>
     <l n="36">Without waiting for any of cookery 's laws .</l>
     <l n="37">A lamb , did I say ? I should just think so , rather ;</l>
     <l n="38">Aye , the mother that bore him , and also his father . ”</l>
     <l n="39">Well , the Wolf was right ; for as long as we feed</l>
     <l n="40">On animals ’ flesh , it is surely unjust</l>
     <l n="41">That we should endeavour to make them recede</l>
     <l n="42">To the primitive food of a root or a crust .</l>
     <l n="43">And beasts of prey , we should always remember ,</l>
     <l n="44">Know not the use of spit or ember .</l>
     <l n="45">Shepherds , shepherds ! trust to me ;</l>
     <l n="46">The Wolf a hermit ne'er can be .</l>

     <l n="12">“ I know you suffer from the spleen ,</l>
     <l n="13">Because this Lion-whelp is bred .</l>
     <l n="14">But why be fearful , since his father</l>
     <l n="15">Is in deaths keeping ? Pity , rather ,</l>
     <l n="16">This orphan child , disconsolate ,</l>

     <l n="18">If he , instead of seeking strife ,</l>
     <l n="19">Can but contrive to save his life . ”</l>
     <l n="20">The Fox replied , “ For orphans such</l>
     <l n="21">My pity is not over much .</l>
     <l n="22">In fact , two things alone remain ,—</l>
     <l n="23">His friendship by some means to gain ,</l>

     <l n="28">To us the bitterest enemy ,</l>
     <l n="29">But to allies he will cling fast .</l>
     <l n="30">So , now , decide : become his friend ,</l>
     <l n="31">Or straightway of him make an end . ”</l>
     <l n="32">But argued thus the Fox in vain :</l>
     <l n="33">The Leopard slept , with all his train ,</l>
     <l n="34">Until the Lion 's whelp , full grown ,</l>
     <l n="35">Spread havoc , and made all his own .</l>
     <l n="36">Then Mr. Fox , with careworn brow ,</l>
     <l n="37">Appealed to , said , “ ‘ Tis useless , now ,</l>
     <l n="38">To think of meeting force by force :</l>
     <l n="39">Suppose to friends you had recourse ,</l>
     <l n="40">They would but eat up all your store ,</l>
     <l n="41">And Master Lion does no more .</l>
     <l n="42">But , sire , remember that the Lion</l>
     <l n="43">Has got three friends he can rely on ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who ask for neither pay nor food ,—</l>
     <l n="45">Strength , Vigilance , and Fortitude .</l>
     <l n="46">So , send him now a sheep or two ;</l>
     <l n="47">If that wo n't answer , lambs a few ;</l>
     <l n="48">And if he 's not content with that ,</l>
     <l n="49">A heifer add , both large and fat ;</l>
     <l n="50">For by this means , perchance , you may</l>
     <l n="51">Save something from this beast of prey . ”</l>
     <l n="52">Thus spoke the Fox ; but to his master</l>
     <l n="53">Th ’ advice seemed ill ; and thence disaster</l>
     <l n="54">Spread over all the country round ;</l>
     <l n="55">For still , combine as might the states ,</l>
     <l n="56">Republics , cities , potentates ,</l>
     <l n="57">They still the Lion master found .</l>
     <l n="58">If you would now the moral know ,</l>
     <l n="59">Just to this brief advice attend :—</l>
     <l n="60">If you have let a Lion grow ,</l>

     <l n="9">The Prince confessed , with many a bitter sigh ,</l>
     <l n="10">The ills that fall on those who sit on high .</l>
     <l n="11">The Shepherd thought it best to throw</l>
     <l n="12">All thoughts of former ills afar ;—</l>
     <l n="13">“ Laments , ” he said , “ no medicines are ;</l>
     <l n="14">So let us use the arts we know ,</l>
     <l n="15">And work , and earn the means to take us back to Rome . ”</l>
     <l n="16">But what is this ? Can prudent language come</l>
     <l n="17">From Shepherd 's mouth ? and is it not , then , true</l>
     <l n="18">That they alone are wise whose blood is blue ?</l>
     <l n="19">Surely sheep and shepherd are ,</l>
     <l n="20">As far as thought goes , on a par ?</l>
     <l n="21">However , wrecked on shores American ,</l>
     <l n="22">Without a choice , the three approved this plan .</l>
     <l n="23">The Merchant cried that they should keep a school ;</l>
     <l n="24">Himself arithmetic would teach by rule ,</l>
     <l n="25">For monthly pay . “ And I , ” the Prince exclaimed ,</l>
     <l n="26">“ Will teach how proper laws for states are framed . ”</l>
     <l n="27">The Noble said , “ And I intend to try</l>
     <l n="28">For pupils in the art of Heraldry . ” —</l>
     <l n="29">As though such wretched stuff could have</l>
     <l n="30">A home beyond the Atlantic wave !</l>
     <l n="31">Then cried the Shepherd , “ Worth all praise</l>
     <l n="32">Are your intentions ; but , remark , the week</l>
     <l n="33">Has many days . Now , where a meal to seek</l>
     <l n="34">I am somewhat in the dark .</l>
     <l n="35">Your prospects of success are good ,</l>
     <l n="36">But I am pining , now , for food ;</l>
     <l n="37">Tell me therefore , comrades , pray ,</l>
     <l n="38">Whence comes to-morrow 's meal , and whence the meal</l>
     <l n="39">to-day ?</l>
     <l n="40">You seem in your resources rich ;</l>
     <l n="41">But food to day 's a subject which</l>
     <l n="42">So presses , that I really must</l>
     <l n="43">Decline to put in you my trust . ”</l>
     <l n="44">This said , the Shepherd in a neighbouring wood</l>
     <l n="45">Collected fagots , which he sold for food ,</l>
     <l n="46">And shared it kindly with his clever friends ,</l>
     <l n="47">Before their talents had attained their ends ,</l>
     <l n="48">Or , by long fasting , they were forced to go</l>
     <l n="49">And air their talents in the world below .</l>
     <l n="50">From this adventure we , I think , may learn</l>
     <l n="51">That for life 's daily needs much learning is not wanted ;</l>
     <l n="52">But that to every man the power to earn</l>
     <l n="53">Food by his labour has been freely granted .</l>

     <l n="10">Flora was first to set</l>

     <l n="22">Assembling his council , one thunderous day ,</l>

     <l n="30">Thus the God of Thunder spoke ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Wolf and the Fox are neighbours strange ,</l>
     <l n="2">And within their reach I 'd not build my grange .</l>
     <l n="3">One of the latter had long espied</l>
     <l n="4">The fowls of a Farmer ; but though he tried</l>
     <l n="5">Each art of his cunning , the hens were still</l>
     <l n="6">Safe from the jaws of the midnight ranger .</l>
     <l n="7">Perplex 'd as he was ‘ twixt his hungry will</l>
     <l n="8">And the wholesome dread of impending danger ,</l>
     <l n="9">“ Alas ! ” he cried , “ it is fine , forsooth ,</l>
     <l n="10">That wretches like these should mock me .</l>
     <l n="11">I come and I go , and I whet my tooth ,</l>
     <l n="12">And with brilliant schemes I stock me ;</l>
     <l n="13">And all this time that horrible lout ,</l>
     <l n="14">The Farmer , makes money , week in , week out ,</l>
     <l n="15">Of chicken and capon , or roasts or boils ;</l>
     <l n="16">Whilst I , who surpass him in wit and sense ,</l>
     <l n="17">Would be glad if I could but carry from hence</l>
     <l n="18">The toughest old hen , as reward for my toils .</l>
     <l n="19">By the gods above and the gods below ,</l>
     <l n="20">Omnipotent Jove ! I should like to know ,</l>
     <l n="21">And I will know , too , why you made me a Fox</l>
     <l n="22">To suffer such troubles and impudent mocks . ”</l>
     <l n="23">So breathing his vengeance , Sir Sly Fox chose</l>
     <l n="24">A night when the world was bathed in repose ;</l>
     <l n="25">When the Farmer , his servants , and even his dogs ,</l>
     <l n="26">Cocks , chickens , and hens slept as sound as logs .</l>
     <l n="27">Now the Farmer himself , with a folly extreme ,</l>
     <l n="28">Had left the door open ere he went to dream ;</l>
     <l n="29">And the consequence was , that the Fox entered in it ,</l>
     <l n="30">And its feathered inhabitants slew in a minute .</l>
     <l n="31">With the morrow 's new-born sun ,</l>
     <l n="32">All the slaughter that was done</l>
     <l n="33">Struck the eye with huge dismay ,</l>
     <l n="34">And almost made the sun avert his rising ray .</l>
     <l n="35">‘ Twas a parallel , in fact ,</l>
     <l n="36">With Apollo 's direful act ,</l>
     <l n="37">When , with Atreus ’ son enraged ,</l>
     <l n="38">With the Greeks such war he waged ,</l>
     <l n="39">That great hillocks of the slain</l>
     <l n="40">Lay heaped high upon the plain .</l>
     <l n="41">Not unlike the ghastly scene</l>
     <l n="42">When great Ajax , filled with spleen ,</l>
     <l n="43">Flocks of sheep and herds of oxen madly slew ,</l>
     <l n="44">Dreaming that he smote the crew</l>
     <l n="45">Who , with famed Ulysses wise ,</l>
     <l n="46">Had deprived him of his prize .</l>
     <l n="47">Then the Fox , whom none could parry ,</l>
     <l n="48">Having seized on what he might ,</l>
     <l n="49">Thought it quite unwise to tarry ,</l>
     <l n="50">And discreetly took to flight .</l>
     <l n="51">Now when the Master rose , be sure</l>
     <l n="52">Against his men and dogs he swore ,</l>
     <l n="53">For ‘ tis a common trick of masters</l>
     <l n="54">Others to blame for their disasters .</l>
     <l n="55">“ Oh , wretched Dog ! ” he shouted forth ;</l>
     <l n="56">“ O Dog ! for drowning only worth ,</l>
     <l n="57">Why barked you not to let us know ? ”</l>
     <l n="58">“ Master , ” the Dog replied , “ I trow ,</l>
     <l n="59">Master and Farmer , ‘ tis not fair</l>
     <l n="60">That I your anger now should share .</l>
     <l n="61">The fowls are yours , and yours the gain ;</l>
     <l n="62">Then why should I , sir , suffer pain ,</l>
     <l n="63">Because you leave your fowls exposed</l>
     <l n="64">To any thief that way disposed ? ”</l>
     <l n="65">Such reasoning , we must all admit ,</l>
     <l n="66">For a mere Dog , was fraught with wit ;</l>
     <l n="67">But , on the other hand , ‘ tis sure</l>
     <l n="68">That masters can n't such wit endure ,</l>
     <l n="69">As Carlo found , when soundly whipped</l>
     <l n="70">For words of sense unwisely slipped .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="71">Now , fathers all , whoe'er you be</l>
     <l n="72">( I aim not at that high degree ) ,</l>
     <l n="73">When you would sleep , trust none of those</l>
     <l n="74">Around you , but your own doors close .</l>
     <l n="75">He who would have a thing well done</l>
     <l n="76">Should trust unto himself alone .</l>

     <l n="1">Once on a time , in slumber wrapt ,</l>
     <l n="2">A certain peasant had a vision</l>

     <l n="4">In endless joys of fields Elysian ;</l>
     <l n="5">Then straightway in a moment 's space</l>

     <l n="10">With sympathy compassionate .</l>

     <l n="14">That straight he woke , and fell surmising</l>
     <l n="15">His dreams were ill , as some aver .</l>
     <l n="16">But soon a wise Interpreter ,</l>

     <l n="21">And mean , On earth , whene'er he could ,</l>
     <l n="22">The Vizier sought sweet solitude ;</l>
     <l n="23">Whereas the Hermit , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="24">To courts of viziers made his way . ”</l>

     <l n="34">When shall the Nine , the heavenly maids ,</l>
     <l n="35">Far from cities , far from towns ,</l>
     <l n="36">Far from human smiles and frowns ,</l>

     <l n="57">But I 've spoken too long , and will only request</l>
     <l n="58">That this secret be hid in your Majesty 's breast :</l>
     <l n="59">Since your Majesty wished me some trait to divulge ,</l>
     <l n="60">Which would show him how those who in self-love indulge</l>

     <l n="30">So changing my key , in a far humbler song</l>
     <l n="31">I 'll tell you a tale , how a fierce bird of prey</l>
     <l n="32">Assaulted a king , and got safely away .</l>
     <l n="33">‘ Tis seldom falconers contrive</l>
     <l n="34">To take a new-fledged Hawk alive ;</l>
     <l n="35">But one so taken , to a King</l>
     <l n="36">Was made a humble offering .</l>
     <l n="37">The bird , if true the story be ,</l>
     <l n="38">No sooner saw his Majesty ,</l>
     <l n="39">Than straight the Royal nose he clawed ,</l>
     <l n="40">And then the Royal forehead gnawed .</l>
     <l n="41">“ What ! clutch a mighty monarch 's nose ?</l>
     <l n="42">He wore no crown , then , I suppose ? ”</l>
     <l n="43">Had he wore crown and sceptre , too ,</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Twere all the same , the creature flew ,</l>
     <l n="45">And King 's nose clawed , like common nose .</l>
     <l n="46">Of course , an uproar loud arose ,</l>
     <l n="47">Such as my verse could scarce describe ,</l>
     <l n="48">From all the startled courtier tribe .</l>
     <l n="49">The King alone was calm and cool :</l>
     <l n="50">For calmness is with kings a rule .</l>
     <l n="51">The bird kept his place , and could not be persuaded</l>
     <l n="52">To vacate the strange throne he 'd so roughly invaded .</l>
     <l n="53">His master , in vain , with threats and with cries ,</l>
     <l n="54">Showed him his fist , but he would not rise .</l>
     <l n="55">And it seemed , at length , as though the bird —</l>
     <l n="56">Insolent creature !— would cling to that feature</l>
     <l n="57">Until the next morning 's chimes were heard .</l>
     <l n="58">The greater the efforts to make him let go ,</l>
     <l n="59">The deeper he dug in each keen-pointed toe .</l>
     <l n="60">At length he relaxed , of his own fickle will ;</l>
     <l n="61">Then the King said to those round about , “ Do not kill</l>
     <l n="62">The poor bird , nor the falconer trouble , for each , in</l>
     <l n="63">His several way , has obeyed Nature 's teaching :—</l>
     <l n="64">The one has just proved himself falconer good ,</l>
     <l n="65">And the other a real savage thing of the wood .</l>
     <l n="66">And I , knowing well that kings clement should be ,</l>
     <l n="67">Grant both full pardon : so let them go free . ”</l>
     <l n="68">Of course , the courtiers all declared</l>
     <l n="69">That such great mercy ne'er was shown ;</l>
     <l n="70">And had the trouble been their own ,</l>
     <l n="71">Nor man nor bird would have been spared .</l>
     <l n="72">Few kings indeed had acted so ,</l>
     <l n="73">And let the woodman freely go .</l>
     <l n="74">They ‘ scaped right well ; but boor and bird</l>
     <l n="75">In nothing in this matter erred ,</l>
     <l n="76">But only this , that , woodland-bred ,</l>
     <l n="77">They had not learnt enough to dread</l>
     <l n="78">The neighbourhood of courts ; but this small lapse</l>
     <l n="79">May be excused in such poor folk , perhaps .</l>

     <l n="94">The tale of that bold bird who clutched the King</l>

     <l n="99">Such captures we but seldom meet —</l>
     <l n="100">Once in a hundred years ; indeed ,</l>
     <l n="101">‘ Tis written in the falconer 's creed</l>
     <l n="102">That woodman who a Hawk can catch</l>
     <l n="103">In nest , is any woodman 's match .</l>
     <l n="104">Through all the crowd of courtiers , then ,</l>
     <l n="105">Our huntsman , happiest of men ,</l>
     <l n="106">Thrust with his prize , at last secure</l>
     <l n="107">His fortune now was firm and sure .</l>
     <l n="108">But , just as he had reached the throne ,</l>
     <l n="109">Seized with a rage before unknown ,</l>
     <l n="110">The savage bird , untamed as yet ,</l>
     <l n="111">In spite of chained foot , turned and set</l>
     <l n="112">His claws deep in his master 's nose .</l>
     <l n="113">All laughed , as you may well suppose —</l>
     <l n="114">The courtiers and the monarch , too ;</l>
     <l n="115">Such very comic sight to view ,</l>
     <l n="116">I 'd give a crown , though it were new .</l>
     <l n="117">If Popes may laugh , I 'm not quite sure</l>

     <l n="119">If they might laugh not — ‘ tis divine ;</l>
     <l n="120">And Jove , though mostly saturnine ,</l>
     <l n="121">With all his comrades , laughs , at times ,</l>
     <l n="122">Enough to shake these earthly climes .</l>
     <l n="123">And Jove laughed loudest when , I think ,</l>
     <l n="124">Poor hobbling Vulcan gave him drink .</l>
     <l n="125">Whether or no , ‘ tis well arranged</l>
     <l n="126">That gods should laugh , my subject 's changed ,</l>
     <l n="127">With reason ; for ‘ tis time to ask</l>
     <l n="128">What moral lies beneath the mask</l>
     <l n="129">Of falconer unfortunate ?</l>
     <l n="130">This simple lesson I will state :—</l>

     <l n="61">A Rat , a Gazelle , and a Tortoise and Crow</l>
     <l n="62">Lived together as friends , in a desolate place ;</l>
     <l n="63">And , as they took care to indulge in no show ,</l>
     <l n="64">Man failed for some time the companions to trace .</l>
     <l n="65">But , alas ! for poor beasts there 's no safety from man ,</l>
     <l n="66">Whatever concealment their instincts may plan ;</l>
     <l n="67">To the heart of the desert , the depths of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="68">Or to heaven 's own vault , ‘ tis in vain that they flee .</l>
     <l n="69">The Gazelle , one sad day , was at innocent play ,</l>
     <l n="70">When a dog — cruel dogs ! whom the men treat as brothers ,</l>
     <l n="71">Though beasts , to assist them to capture the others —</l>
     <l n="72">Unluckily snuffed at her scent , and , pursuing ,</l>
     <l n="73">Led on his fierce master , to cause her undoing .</l>
     <l n="74">When dinner came that day , the Rat</l>
     <l n="75">Said , “ What can Miss Gazelle be at ?</l>
     <l n="76">She surely dreads some new attacks ,</l>
     <l n="77">Or else our friendship 's bonds relax ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">“ Ah ! ” then the Tortoise , sighing , cried ,</l>
     <l n="79">“ If Heaven wings would but provide ,</l>
     <l n="80">Such as our Crow has , I would fly ,</l>
     <l n="81">And all around the country spy ,</l>
     <l n="82">To find what accidents withhold</l>
     <l n="83">Our friend . Her heart 's as good as gold . ”</l>
     <l n="84">The Crow , without a word , took flight ,</l>
     <l n="85">And soon had poor Gazelle in sight ,</l>
     <l n="86">Tied up with cords against a tree ,</l>
     <l n="87">A hapless piece of misery .</l>
     <l n="88">At once the Crow , without a pause ,</l>
     <l n="89">Flies back , nor seeks to probe the cause ,</l>
     <l n="90">The whys , the wherefores , or the when</l>
     <l n="91">Which make Gazelles the prey of men .</l>
     <l n="92">Nor loses time , for action meant ,</l>
     <l n="93">In a pedantic argument .</l>
     <l n="94">The Crow 's report was duly heard ,</l>
     <l n="95">And then the Crow a vote preferred</l>
     <l n="96">That two should speed , without delay ,</l>
     <l n="97">To where their friend in bondage lay ,</l>
     <l n="98">But that the Tortoise , lying still ,</l>
     <l n="99">Should serve the counter ,— guard the till ;</l>
     <l n="100">For , whilst the Tortoise ’ step is slow ,</l>
     <l n="101">Gazelles die quickly , as we know .</l>
     <l n="102">The words were scarcely said , when forth</l>
     <l n="103">The angry Crow and Rat went north ,</l>
     <l n="104">To where their dark-eyed , dear Gazelle</l>
     <l n="105">Lay , victim of man 's purpose fell .</l>
     <l n="106">The Tortoise , also , not behind-hand</l>
     <l n="107">To lend to any one a kind hand ,</l>
     <l n="108">Toiled thither , also , grimly swearing</l>
     <l n="109">That he his house must still be bearing .</l>
     <l n="110">Arrived at the place where the Deer was confined ,</l>
     <l n="111">Sir &lt; i > Gnaw-net &lt;/ i > ( the Rat is so properly named )</l>
     <l n="112">At once set his teeth the hard cordage to grind ,</l>
     <l n="113">And in less than two minutes the friend was reclaimed</l>
     <l n="114">The hunter coming up just then ,</l>
     <l n="115">Cursed like a thousand sporting men ;</l>
     <l n="116">And Master Rat , with prudence fraught ,</l>
     <l n="117">A cozy hole directly sought ,</l>
     <l n="118">Whilst Crow swam safely up to tree ,</l>
     <l n="119">And dear Gazelle in woods ran free .</l>
     <l n="120">Just then the hunter , in a state</l>
     <l n="121">Of hunger most disconsolate ,</l>
     <l n="122">Perceived the Tortoise on his path ,</l>
     <l n="123">And , thereupon , subdued his wrath .</l>
     <l n="124">“ Why should I , ” said he , “ vex myself ?</l>
     <l n="125">This beast will grace my supper-shelf . ”</l>
     <l n="126">And thus the hapless Tortoise soon</l>
     <l n="127">Had been condemned to knife and spoon ,</l>
     <l n="128">Had not the Crow the dear Gazelle</l>
     <l n="129">Taught how to act the lame man well .</l>
     <l n="130">The timid deer , with halting feet ,</l>
     <l n="131">Went forth , the hunter 's eyes to meet .</l>
     <l n="132">The man threw off , without delay ,</l>
     <l n="133">All that his eager steps might stay —</l>
     <l n="134">The Tortoise , with some other things .</l>
     <l n="135">Of course the Rat undid the strings</l>
     <l n="136">That held the bag where Tortoise lay ,</l>
     <l n="137">And all four friends got safe away !</l>

     <l n="29">Old Fox this was ! his enemies soon ran</l>
     <l n="30">To where he lay for dead . The barking clan</l>
     <l n="31">Filled all the air with clamour long and loud .</l>
     <l n="32">The master whipped away the noisy crowd :</l>

     <l n="37">Much to his loss . ” And , while the dogs give tongue ,</l>

     <l n="1">A Philosopher once , who , in Scythia born ,</l>
     <l n="2">Had somewhat , with study , his brain-pan outworn ,</l>
     <l n="3">Made his mind up , for pleasure and profit , to seek</l>
     <l n="4">Repose for a time in the land of the Greek ;</l>
     <l n="5">And there he made friends with a man of the kind</l>
     <l n="6">Whom Virgil so well in the Georgics defined :</l>
     <l n="7">A man who 's a king , for himself he controls ,</l>
     <l n="8">And a god , for he blends his own will with men 's souls .</l>
     <l n="9">He found him with pruning-knife grasped in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="10">Pruning here , snipping there , in all parts of his land ,</l>
     <l n="11">As tranquil as Jove ; here he cut off a twig ,</l>
     <l n="12">There lopped off a branch to make others more big ;</l>
     <l n="13">For Nature , experience had taught him , is prone</l>
     <l n="14">To waste in rash gifts all the wealth of her throne .</l>
     <l n="15">The Scythian , brought up in town , was downcast ,</l>
     <l n="16">And looked at the ruinous waste quite aghast ,</l>
     <l n="17">And exclaimed , “ My dear friend , lay your pruning</l>

     <l n="19">And let Nature , judicious , take care of her own ;</l>

     <l n="21">The fruits which Time 's tooth will but too soon devour . ”</l>
     <l n="22">The old man replied , with a rustical grace ,</l>
     <l n="23">“ I cut useless ones off to give useful ones space . ”</l>
     <l n="24">Struck by wisdom like this , with no moments delay ,</l>
     <l n="25">The Scythian homewards at once took his way ;</l>
     <l n="26">And no sooner had got there but took up a bill ,</l>
     <l n="27">And at cutting and hewing showed wonderful skill :</l>
     <l n="28">Hewed branches , snipped twigs , and persuaded his</l>

     <l n="30">To share in his rude horticultural labours .</l>
     <l n="31">The result is soon told : hacking trees without reason ,</l>

     <l n="3">Nor war , nor any like disaster ,</l>
     <l n="4">Could harm them under such a master .</l>

    <head>THE ARBITRATOR , ALMONER , AND HERMIT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Three saints , by holy fervour fired ,</l>
     <l n="2">To gain the heights of heaven aspired ;</l>
     <l n="3">But , as the well-known proverb says ,</l>
     <l n="4">Rome can be reached by various ways ,</l>
     <l n="5">So these by different methods planned</l>
     <l n="6">To gain the shores of Canaan 's land .</l>
     <l n="7">One , touched by the expense and care</l>
     <l n="8">Which luckless suitors have to bear ,</l>
     <l n="9">Offered cases to determine</l>
     <l n="10">Without a fee , or wig , or ermine .</l>
     <l n="11">Since human laws were first began ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lawsuits have been the curse of man ;</l>
     <l n="13">Absorbing half , three-fourths , or all</l>
     <l n="14">Of days which , at the best , are small .</l>
     <l n="15">To cure a state of things so vicious ,</l>
     <l n="16">Our Umpire thought his plan judicious .</l>
     <l n="17">The second of our saints declares</l>
     <l n="18">The sick sole object of his cares ;</l>
     <l n="19">And I praise him : in truth , to me</l>
     <l n="20">This seems the truest charity .</l>
     <l n="21">But sick men , troublous then , as now ,</l>
     <l n="22">Our good man vexed enough , I vow .</l>
     <l n="23">Capricious , restless , petulant ,</l>
     <l n="24">Each moment brings a separate want ;</l>
     <l n="25">And , if no other fault they find ,</l>
     <l n="26">They cry , “ To such and such he 's kind :</l>
     <l n="27">Spends all his days and nights in caring</l>
     <l n="28">For them , and leaves us here despairing . ”</l>
     <l n="29">But these complaints were small to those</l>
     <l n="30">Which harassed , every day , the heart</l>
     <l n="31">Of him who , well-intentioned , chose</l>
     <l n="32">To act the Arbitrator 's part .</l>
     <l n="33">The plaintiff and defendant , both ,</l>
     <l n="34">T ’ adopt his sentences were loth ;</l>
     <l n="35">And swore , with all their might and main ,</l>
     <l n="36">His partiality was plain .</l>
     <l n="37">By such abuse as this disgusted ,</l>
     <l n="38">The Umpire and the Almoner</l>
     <l n="39">Each unto each his woes entrusted ;</l>
     <l n="40">And each agreed he could not bear</l>
     <l n="41">To be so shamefully mistrusted .</l>
     <l n="42">This being so , they sought a glade</l>
     <l n="43">Which neither suns nor winds invade ,</l>
     <l n="44">And there , beneath a rugged mountain ,</l>
     <l n="45">Beside a clear and babbling fountain ,</l>
     <l n="46">They found their friend the Hermit saint ;</l>
     <l n="47">So each one having made his plaint ,</l>
     <l n="48">Asked his advice . “ Your own pursue , ”</l>
     <l n="49">Replied their friend ; “ for who but you</l>
     <l n="50">Can know your several wants ? To know</l>
     <l n="51">One 's self makes gods of man below .</l>
     <l n="52">And let me ask you , have you found</l>
     <l n="53">This knowledge where vast crowds abound ?</l>
     <l n="54">No ; trust me , it can only be</l>
     <l n="55">The fruit of sweet tranquillity .</l>
     <l n="56">Shake but the water in your vase ,</l>
     <l n="57">And you no longer see your face ;</l>
     <l n="58">But let it once more still remain ,</l>
     <l n="59">And straight your likeness comes again .</l>
     <l n="60">‘ Midst worldly scenes you 'll never learn</l>
     <l n="61">The love for which we all should yearn .</l>
     <l n="62">Believe me , friends , the desert 's best</l>
