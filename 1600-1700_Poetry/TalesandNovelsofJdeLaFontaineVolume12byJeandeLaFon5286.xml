    <head>THE MONKS OF CATALONIA</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">TO you , my friends , allow me to detail ,</l>
     <l n="2">The feats of monks in Catalonia 's vale ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where oft the holy fathers pow'rs displayed ,</l>
     <l n="4">And showed such charity to wife and maid ,</l>
     <l n="5">That o'er their minds sweet fascination reigned ,</l>
     <l n="6">And made them think , they Paradise had gained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">SUCH characters oft preciously advise ,</l>
     <l n="8">And youthful easy female minds surprise ,</l>
     <l n="9">The beauteous FAIR encircle with their net ,</l>
     <l n="10">And , of the feeling heart , possession get :</l>
     <l n="11">Work in the holy vineyard , you may guess ,</l>
     <l n="12">And , as our tale will show , with full success .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">IN times of old , when learning ‘ mong the FAIR ,</l>
     <l n="14">Enough to read the testament , was rare ,</l>
     <l n="15">( Times howsoe'er thought difficult to quote ,)</l>
     <l n="16">A swarm of monks of gormandizing note ,</l>
     <l n="17">Arrived and fixed themselves within a town ,</l>
     <l n="18">For young and beauteous belles of great renown ,</l>
     <l n="19">While , of gallants , there seemed but very few ,</l>
     <l n="20">Though num'rous aged husbands you might view .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">A NOBLE chapel soon the fathers raised ,</l>
     <l n="22">To which the females ran and highly praised ,</l>
     <l n="23">Surveyed it o'er and confidently thought ,</l>
     <l n="24">‘ Twas there , of course , salvation should be sought .</l>
     <l n="25">And when their faith had thoroughly been proved ,</l>
     <l n="26">To gain their point the monks the veil removed .—</l>
     <l n="27">Good father Andrew scorned to use finesse ,</l>
     <l n="28">And in discourse the sex would thus address .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">IF any thing prevent your sov'reign bliss ,</l>
     <l n="30">And Paradise incautiously you miss ,</l>
     <l n="31">Most certainly the evil will arise ,</l>
     <l n="32">From keeping for your husbands large supplies ,</l>
     <l n="33">Of what a surplus you have clearly got ,</l>
     <l n="34">And more than requisite to them allot ,</l>
     <l n="35">Without bestowing on your trusty friends ,</l>
     <l n="36">The saving that to no one blessings lends .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="37">PERHAPS you 'll tell me , marriage boons we shun ;</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Tis true , and Heav'n be praised enough is done ,</l>
     <l n="39">Without those duties to require our share</l>
     <l n="40">You know from direful sin we guard the FAIR .</l>
     <l n="41">Ingratitude ‘ s declared the height of crimes ,</l>
     <l n="42">And God pronounced it such in early times ;</l>
     <l n="43">For this eternally was Satan curst ;</l>
     <l n="44">Howe'er you err , be careful of the worst .</l>
     <l n="45">Return to Heav'n your thanks for bounteous care ,</l>
     <l n="46">And then to us a tithe of surplus spare ,</l>
     <l n="47">Which costs you nothing worth a moment 's thought ;</l>
     <l n="48">And marks the zeal with which our faith is taught ,</l>
     <l n="49">A claim legitimate our order opes ,</l>
     <l n="50">Bestowed , for holy offices , by popes ,</l>
     <l n="51">No charitable gift , but lawful right :</l>
     <l n="52">Priests well supported are a glorious sight .</l>
     <l n="53">Four times a year , exactly to a day ,</l>
     <l n="54">Each wife this tithe should personally pay</l>
     <l n="55">Our holy saint requires that you submit :</l>
     <l n="56">‘ Tis founded on decrees of holy writ .</l>
     <l n="57">All Nature carefully the law reveres ,</l>
     <l n="58">That gratitude and fealty endears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="59">NOW marriage works we rank as an estate ,</l>
     <l n="60">And tithe is due for that at any rate .</l>
     <l n="61">We 'll take it patiently , whate'er the toil :</l>
     <l n="62">Nor be o'er nice about the justful spoil .</l>
     <l n="63">Our order have not , you must surely know ,</l>
     <l n="64">By many comforts , what we wish below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">‘ TIS right , however , that I now suggest ,</l>
     <l n="66">Whatever passes must not be expressed ;</l>
     <l n="67">But naught to husbands , parents , friends , reveal ;</l>
     <l n="68">From ev'ry one the mysterious conceal .</l>
     <l n="69">Three words th ’ apostle taught : be these your care ;</l>
     <l n="70">FAITH , CHARITY , and PRUDENCE learn to share .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="71">THE holy father , by his fine discourse ,</l>
     <l n="72">Delivered with the most impressive force ,</l>
     <l n="73">Gave wonderous satisfaction and surprise ,</l>
     <l n="74">And passed with all for Solomon the wise ;</l>
     <l n="75">Few slept while Andrew preached , and ev'ry wife ,</l>
     <l n="76">His precepts guarded as she would her life ;</l>
     <l n="77">And these not solely treasured in the mind ,</l>
     <l n="78">But showed to practise them the heart inclined ,</l>
     <l n="79">Each hastened tithe to bring without delay ,</l>
     <l n="80">And quarrelled who should be the first to pay ;</l>
     <l n="81">Loud murmurs rang , and many city dames ,</l>
     <l n="82">Were forced to keep till morn the friar 's claims ,</l>
     <l n="83">And HOLY CHURCH , not knowing what to do ,</l>
     <l n="84">Such numbers seemed to be in paying cue ,</l>
     <l n="85">At length was forced , without restraint , to say ,</l>
     <l n="86">The Lord commands that , till a future day ,</l>
     <l n="87">You give us time to breathe :— so large the lot ,</l>
     <l n="88">To serve for present we enough have got ;</l>
     <l n="89">Too much the whole at once , but by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="90">Your tithe we 'll take and all contrive to please .</l>
     <l n="91">With us arrange the hour you would be here ,</l>
     <l n="92">And some to-day :— to-morrow more we 'll cheer ;</l>
     <l n="93">The whole in order , and you 'll clearly see ,</l>
     <l n="94">That SOFTLY with FAIRLY best agree .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="95">THE sex inclined to follow this advice ;</l>
     <l n="96">About receipts however they were not nice ;</l>
     <l n="97">The entertainment greatly was admired ,</l>
     <l n="98">And pure devotion all their bosoms fired ,</l>
     <l n="99">A glass of cordial some apart received ;</l>
     <l n="100">Good cheer was given , may be well believed ;</l>
     <l n="101">Ten youthful dames brisk friar Fripart took ,</l>
     <l n="102">Gay , airy , and engaging ev'ry look ,</l>
     <l n="103">Who paid with pleasure all the monk could wish ;</l>
     <l n="104">Some had fifteen :— some twelve to taste their dish ;</l>
     <l n="105">Good friar Rock had twenty for his share ,</l>
     <l n="106">And gave such satisfaction to the FAIR ,</l>
     <l n="107">That some , to show they never grudged the price ,</l>
     <l n="108">And proved their punctuality ,— paid twice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="109">So much indeed , that satiated with ways ,</l>
     <l n="110">That six long months engaged their nights and days :</l>
     <l n="111">They gladly credit would have given now ,</l>
     <l n="112">But found the ladies would not this allow ,</l>
     <l n="113">Believing it most positively wrong ,</l>
     <l n="114">To keep whate'er might to the church belong .</l>
     <l n="115">No tithe arrears were any where around ,</l>
     <l n="116">So zealous were the dames in duty found ,</l>
     <l n="117">They often in advance paid holy dues ,</l>
     <l n="118">How pure the monks !— how just the ladies views !</l>
     <l n="119">The friars used despatch alone with those ,</l>
     <l n="120">That for their fascinating charms they chose ,</l>
     <l n="121">And sent the sempiternals to bestow ,</l>
     <l n="122">The tribute they had brought on those below ,</l>
     <l n="123">For in the refuse tithes that were their lot ,</l>
     <l n="124">The laicks oft pleasant pickings got .</l>
     <l n="125">In short ‘ twas difficult to say ,</l>
     <l n="126">What charity was shown from day to day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="127">IT happened that one night a married dame ,</l>
     <l n="128">Desirous to convey the monks their claim ,</l>
     <l n="129">And walking with her spouse just by the spot ,</l>
     <l n="130">Where dwelled the arch contrivers of the plot ,</l>
     <l n="131">Good Heavens ! said she , I well remember now ,</l>
     <l n="132">I 've business with a friar here , I vow ;</l>
     <l n="133">‘ Twill presently be done if you 'll but wait ;</l>
     <l n="134">Religious duties we must ne'er abate .</l>
     <l n="135">What duties ? cried the husband with surprise ;</l>
     <l n="136">You 're surely mad :— ‘ tis midnight I surmise ;</l>
     <l n="137">Confess yourself to-morrow if required ;</l>
     <l n="138">The holy fathers are to bed retired .</l>
     <l n="139">That makes no difference , the lady cried .—</l>
     <l n="140">I think it does , the husband straight replied ,</l>
     <l n="141">And thither I 'll not let you go to-night :—</l>
     <l n="142">What heinous sins so terribly affright ,</l>
     <l n="143">That in such haste the mind you wish to ease ?</l>
     <l n="144">To-morrow morn repair whene'er you please :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="145">YOU do me wrong , rejoined the charming fair ;</l>
     <l n="146">I neither want confession nor a prayer ,</l>
     <l n="147">But anxiously desire what is due to pay ;</l>
     <l n="148">For if incautiously I should delay ,</l>
     <l n="149">Long time ‘ would be ere I the monk should see ,</l>
     <l n="150">With other matters he 'll so busy be .</l>
     <l n="151">But what can you the holy fathers owe ?</l>
     <l n="152">To which the lady said :— what do n't you know ?</l>
     <l n="153">A tithe , my dear , the friars always claim .—</l>
     <l n="154">What tithe ? cried he ; it surely has a name .</l>
     <l n="155">Not know ! astonishingly , replied the wife .—</l>
     <l n="156">To which the husband answered :— On my life ,</l>
     <l n="157">That women friars pay is very strange ;</l>
     <l n="158">Will you particulars with me arrange ?</l>
     <l n="159">How cunningly , said she , you seem to act ;</l>
     <l n="160">Why clearly you 're acquainted with the fact ?</l>
     <l n="161">‘ Tis Hymeneal works :— What works ? cried he —</l>
     <l n="162">Lord ! said the dame , assuredly you see ,</l>
     <l n="163">Why I had paid an hour ago or more</l>
     <l n="164">And you 've prevented me when at the door ;</l>
     <l n="165">I 'm sure , of those who owe , I 'm not the worst ,</l>
     <l n="166">For I , in paying , always was the first .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="167">THE husband quite astonished now appeared ;</l>
     <l n="168">At once a hundred diff'rent ills he feared ;</l>
     <l n="169">But questioning his wife howe'er , he found ,</l>
     <l n="170">That many other dames who lived around ,</l>
     <l n="171">Like her ; in paying tithes , the monks obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="172">Which consolation to his breast conveyed .</l>
     <l n="173">Poor innocent ! she nothing wished to hide ;</l>
     <l n="174">Said she , not one but tithe they make provide ;</l>
     <l n="175">Good friar Aubrey takes your sister 's dues ;</l>
     <l n="176">To father Fabry Mrs. B 's accrues ;</l>
     <l n="177">The mayoress friar William likes to greet ,</l>
     <l n="178">A monk more handsome scarcely you will meet ;</l>
     <l n="179">And I to friar Gerard always go ;</l>
     <l n="180">I wished this night to pay him all I owe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="181">ALAS ! when tongues unbridled drop disguise ,</l>
     <l n="182">What direful ills , what discords oft arise !</l>
     <l n="183">The cunning husband having thus obtained ,</l>
     <l n="184">Particulars of what the fathers gained ,</l>
     <l n="185">At first designed in secret to disclose ,</l>
     <l n="186">Those scenes of fraud and matrimonial woes :</l>
     <l n="187">The mayor and citizens should know , he thought ;</l>
     <l n="188">What dues were paid : what tithes the friars sought ;</l>
     <l n="189">But since ‘ twas rather difficult to place ,</l>
     <l n="190">Full credence , at the first , in such a case ,</l>
     <l n="191">He judged it best to make the fellow speak ,</l>
     <l n="192">To whom his wife had shown herself so weak .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="193">FOR father Gerard in the morn he sent ,</l>
     <l n="194">Who , unsuspecting , to the husband went ,</l>
     <l n="195">When , in the presence of the injured wife ,</l>
     <l n="196">He drew his sword and swore he 'd take his life ,</l>
     <l n="197">Unless the mystery he would disclose ,</l>
     <l n="198">Which he reluctantly through terror chose .</l>
     <l n="199">Then having bound the friar hand and foot ,</l>
     <l n="200">And in another room his lady put ,</l>
     <l n="201">He sallied forth his hapless lot to tell ,</l>
     <l n="202">And to the mayor exposed the wily spell ;</l>
     <l n="203">The corporation next ; then up and down ,</l>
     <l n="204">The secret he divulged throughout the town .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="205">A CRY for vengeance presently was heard ;</l>
     <l n="206">The whole at once to slaughter , some preferred</l>
     <l n="207">While others would the place with fire surround ,</l>
     <l n="208">And burn the house with those within it found .</l>
     <l n="209">Some wished to drown them , bound within their dress ;</l>
     <l n="210">With various other projects you may guess ;</l>
     <l n="211">But all agreed that death should be their lot ,</l>
     <l n="212">And those for burning had most voices got .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="213">WITHOUT delay they to the convent flew ;</l>
     <l n="214">But when the holy mansion came in view ,</l>
     <l n="215">Respect , the place of execution changed ;</l>
     <l n="216">A citizen his barn for this arranged ;</l>
     <l n="217">The crafty crew together were confined ,</l>
     <l n="218">And in the blaze their wretched lives resigned ,</l>
     <l n="219">While round the husbands danced at sound of drum ,</l>
     <l n="220">And burnt whatever to their hands had come ;</l>
     <l n="221">Naught ‘ scaped their fury , monks of all degrees ,</l>
     <l n="222">Robes , mantles , capuchins , and mock decrees :</l>
     <l n="223">All perished properly within the flames ;</l>
     <l n="224">But nothing more I find about the dames ;</l>
     <l n="225">And friar Gerard , in another place ,</l>
     <l n="226">Had met apart his merited disgrace .</l>

    <head>THE CRADLE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NEAR Rome , of yore , close to the Florence road ,</l>
     <l n="2">Was seen a humble innkeeper 's abode ;</l>
     <l n="3">Small sums were charged ; few guests the night would stay ;</l>
     <l n="4">And these could seldom much afford to pay .</l>
     <l n="5">A pleasing active partner had the host</l>
     <l n="6">Her age not much ‘ bove thirty at the most ;</l>
     <l n="7">Two children she her loving husband bore ;</l>
     <l n="8">The boy was one year old : the daughter more ;</l>
     <l n="9">Just fifteen summers o'er her form had smiled ;</l>

     <l n="11">IT happened that Pinucio , young and gay ,</l>
     <l n="12">A youth of family , oft passed the way ,</l>
     <l n="13">Admired the girl , and thought she might be gained ,</l>
     <l n="14">Attentions showed , and like return obtained ;</l>
     <l n="15">The mistress was not deaf , nor lover mute ;</l>
     <l n="16">Pinucio seemed the lady 's taste to suit ,</l>
     <l n="17">Of pleasing person and engaging air ;</l>
     <l n="18">And ‘ mong the equals of our youthful fair ,</l>
     <l n="19">As yet , not one a pref'rence had received ;</l>
     <l n="20">Nor had she e'er in golden dreams believed ;</l>
     <l n="21">But , spite of tender years , her mind was high ,</l>

     <l n="24">And many in the place her hand desired ,</l>
     <l n="25">Rejected some , and others would not take ,</l>
     <l n="26">And this most clearly for Pinucio 's sake .</l>
     <l n="27">Long conversations she could rarely get ,</l>
     <l n="28">And various obstacles the lovers met ;</l>
     <l n="29">No interviews where they might be at ease ,</l>
     <l n="30">But ev'ry thing conspired to fret and teaze .</l>
     <l n="31">O parents , husbands ! be advised by me ;</l>
     <l n="32">Constraint with wives or children wo n't agree ;</l>

     <l n="35">PINUCIO and a friend , one stormy night ,</l>
     <l n="36">The landlord 's reached and would in haste alight ;</l>
     <l n="37">They asked for beds , but were too late they found :</l>
     <l n="38">You know , sir , cried the host , we do n't abound ;</l>
     <l n="39">And now the very garrets we have let :</l>
     <l n="40">You 'd better elsewhere try your wish to get ,</l>
     <l n="41">And spite of weather , further on pursue</l>
     <l n="42">At best , our lodging is unfit for you .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="43">HAVE you no truckle bed ? the lover cried ;</l>
     <l n="44">No corner left ?— we fain would here abide :</l>
     <l n="45">Why , truly , said the host , we always keep</l>
     <l n="46">Two beds within the chamber where we sleep ;</l>
     <l n="47">My wife and I , of course , take one of these ;</l>
     <l n="48">Together lie in t'other if you please .</l>
     <l n="49">The spark replied , this we will gladly do ;</l>
     <l n="50">Come , supper get ; that o'er , the friends withdrew :</l>
     <l n="51">Pinucio , by Coletta 's sage advice ,</l>
     <l n="52">In looking o'er the room was very nice ;</l>
     <l n="53">With eagle-eyes particulars he traced ,</l>
     <l n="54">Then ‘ tween the clothes himself and friend he placed .</l>
     <l n="55">A camp-bed for the girl was on the floor ;</l>
     <l n="56">The landlord 's , ‘ gainst the wall and next the door ;</l>
     <l n="57">Another opposite the last was set ,</l>
     <l n="58">And this , to guests , at certain times was let ;</l>
     <l n="59">And ‘ tween the two , but near the parents ’ best ,</l>
     <l n="60">A cradle for the child to rest its head ,</l>
     <l n="61">From which a pleasant accident arrived ,</l>
     <l n="62">That our gallant 's young friend of rest deprived .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">WHEN midnight came , and this gay spark supposed</l>
     <l n="64">The host and hostess ’ eyes in sleep were closed ,</l>
     <l n="65">Convinced the time appointed was at hand ,</l>
     <l n="66">To put in execution what was planned ,</l>
     <l n="67">He to the camp-bed silently repaired ,</l>
     <l n="68">And found the belle by Morpheus not insnared ;</l>
     <l n="69">Coletta taught a play that mortals find</l>
     <l n="70">Fatigues the body more than plagues the mind :</l>
     <l n="71">A truce succeeded , but ‘ twas quickly o'er :</l>
     <l n="72">Those rest not long who pilfer Cupid 's store .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="73">AGAIN , when to the room the hostess came ,</l>
     <l n="74">And found the cradle rested not the same ,</l>
     <l n="75">Good heav'ns ! cried she , it joins my husband 's head :</l>
     <l n="76">And , but for that , I truly had been led</l>
     <l n="77">To lay myself unthinkingly beside</l>
     <l n="78">The strangers whom with lodging we provide ;</l>
     <l n="79">But , God be praised , this cradle shows the place</l>
     <l n="80">Where my good husband 's pillow I must trace .</l>
     <l n="81">This said , she with the friend was quickly laid ,</l>
     <l n="82">Without suspecting what mistake she 'd made .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="83">BETWEEN the lovers all was blithe and gay ,</l>
     <l n="84">When suddenly the friend , though far from day ,</l>
     <l n="85">Was forced to rise ( ‘ twas plain a pressing case ,)</l>
     <l n="86">And move the infant 's cradle from its place ,</l>
     <l n="87">To ope the door , and lest he noise might make ,</l>
     <l n="88">Or any way by chance the child should wake ,</l>
     <l n="89">He set it carefully beside his bed ,</l>
     <l n="90">And ( softly treading ) to the garden sped .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="91">ON his return he passed the cradle by ;</l>
     <l n="92">To place it as before he would not try ,</l>
     <l n="93">But went to sleep ; when presently a sound ,</l>
     <l n="94">From something that had tumbled , rang around ,</l>
     <l n="95">Awoke his wife , who ran below ,</l>
     <l n="96">That what had happened she might clearly know .</l>
     <l n="97">No fool in such adventures was our Wight :</l>
     <l n="98">The opportunity he would not slight ,</l>
     <l n="99">But played the husband well : no , no , I 'm wrong ;</l>
     <l n="100">He played it ill :— too oft , too much , too long ;</l>
     <l n="101">For whosoe'er would wish to do it well ,</l>
     <l n="102">Should softly go :— the gentle most excel .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="103">IN truth , the wife was quite surprised to find</l>
     <l n="104">Her spouse so much to frolicking inclined ;</l>
     <l n="105">Said she , what ails the man , he 's grown so gay ?</l>
     <l n="106">A lad of twenty 's not more fond of play .</l>
     <l n="107">Well ! let 's enjoy the moments while we can ;</l>
     <l n="108">God 's will be done , since life is but a span !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="109">THE words were scarcely said , when our gallant</l>
     <l n="110">Renewed his fun , and nothing seemed to want ;</l>
     <l n="111">Indeed , the hostess still her charms possessed ,</l>
     <l n="112">And , on occasion , well might be caressed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="113">MEANWHILE Coletta , dreading a surprise ,</l>
     <l n="114">Prevailed upon her paramour to rise ;</l>
     <l n="115">‘ Twas nearly break of day when he withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="116">But , groping to his place the way anew ,</l>
     <l n="117">Pinucio , by the cradle too , was led</l>
     <l n="118">To miss his friend 's and take the landlord 's bed .</l>
     <l n="119">No sooner in than with an under voice ,</l>
     <l n="120">( Intriguers oft too eagerly rejoice ,)</l>
     <l n="121">Said he , my friend , I wish I could relate</l>
     <l n="122">The pleasure I 've received ; my bliss is great ;</l>
     <l n="123">To you , I 'm sorry , Fortune proves so cold ;</l>
     <l n="124">Like happiness I 'd fain in you behold ;</l>
     <l n="125">Coletta is a morsel for a king ;</l>
     <l n="126">Inestimable girl !— to me she 'll cling .</l>
     <l n="127">I 've many seen , but such a charming fair ,</l>
     <l n="128">There 's not another like her any where .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="129">WITH softest skin , delightful form and mien ;</l>
     <l n="130">Her ev'ry act resembles BEAUTY 's queen ;</l>
     <l n="131">In short , before we 'd ended with our fun ,</l>
     <l n="132">Six posts ( without a fiction ) we had run .</l>
     <l n="133">The host was struck with what the spark averred ,</l>
     <l n="134">And muttered something indistinctly heard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="135">THE hostess whispered HIM she thought her spouse :—</l>
     <l n="136">Again , my dear , such sparks let 's never house ;</l>
     <l n="137">Pray do n't you hear how they together chat ?—</l>
     <l n="138">Just then the husband raised himself and sat ;</l>
     <l n="139">Is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage ;</l>
     <l n="140">Was it for THIS you would my house engage ?</l>
     <l n="141">You understand me , but I 'll seek redress ;</l>
     <l n="142">Think you so very cheap to have success ?</l>
     <l n="143">What , would you ruin families at will ,</l>
     <l n="144">And with our daughters take at ease your fill ?</l>
     <l n="145">Away , I say ! my house this moment quit ;</l>
     <l n="146">And as for You , abominable chit ,</l>
     <l n="147">I 'll have your life : this hour you breathe your last ;</l>
     <l n="148">Such creatures only can with beasts be classed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="149">PINUCIO heard the lecture with dismay ,</l>
     <l n="150">At once was mute , and grew as cold as clay ;</l>
     <l n="151">A moment 's silence through the room prevailed ;</l>
     <l n="152">Coletta trembled , and her lot bewailed .</l>
     <l n="153">The hostess now , on ev'ry side perceived</l>
     <l n="154">Her peril great , and for the error grieved .</l>
     <l n="155">The friend , howe'er , the cradle called to mind ,</l>
     <l n="156">Which caused the many ills we 've seen combined ,</l>
     <l n="157">And instantly he cried :— Pinucio ! strange</l>
     <l n="158">You thus allow yourself about to range ;</l>
     <l n="159">Did I not tell you when the wine you took ,</l>
     <l n="160">‘ Twould make many sad misfortunes hook ?</l>
     <l n="161">Whene'er you freely drink , ‘ tis known fall well ,</l>
     <l n="162">Your sleep 's disturbed , you walk , and nonsense tell .</l>
     <l n="163">Come , come to bed : the morning soon will peep ;</l>
     <l n="164">Pinucio took the hint , pretended sleep ,</l>
     <l n="165">And carried on so artfully the wile ,</l>
     <l n="166">The husband no suspicion had of guile .</l>
     <l n="167">The stratagem our hostess likewise tried ,</l>
     <l n="168">And to her daughter 's bed in silence hied ,</l>
     <l n="169">Where she conceived her fortress was so strong ,</l>
     <l n="170">She presently began to use her tongue ,</l>
     <l n="171">And cried aloud :— Impossible the fact ;</l>
     <l n="172">Such things he could not with Coletta act ;</l>
     <l n="173">I 've with her been in bed throughout the night ,</l>
     <l n="174">And she , no more than I , has swerved from right ;</l>
     <l n="175">‘ Twere mighty pretty , truly , here to come ;</l>
     <l n="176">At this the host a little while was dumb ;</l>
     <l n="177">But in a lower tone at length replied</l>
     <l n="178">I nought with your account I 'm satisfied .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="179">THE party rose ; the titter circled round ;</l>
     <l n="180">And each sufficient reason for it found ;</l>
     <l n="181">The whole was secret , and whoe'er had gained ,</l>
     <l n="182">With care upon the subject mute remained .</l>
