   <p>TO THE READER .</p>
   <p>If ever anything , call 'd a Poem , deserv 'd a severe Reflection , that of Absalom and Achitophel may justly contract it . For tho ’ Lines can never be purg 'd from the dross and filth they would throw on others ( there being no retraction that can expiate the conveying of persons to an unjust and publick reproach ) ; yet the cleansing of their fames from a design 'd pollution , may well become a more ingenious Pen than the Author of these few reflections will presume to challenge .</p>
   <p>To epitomize which scandalous Phamphlet ( unworthy the denomination of Poesy ) no eye can inspect it without a prodigious amazement ; the abuses being so gross and deliberate , that it seems rather a Capital or National Libel , than personal exposures , in order to an infamous detraction . For how does he character the King , but as a broad figure of scandalous inclinations , or contriv 'd unto such irregularities , as renders him rather the property of Parasites and Vice , than suitable to the accomplishment of so excellent a Prince ? Nay , he forces on King David such a Royal resemblance , that he darkens his sanctity in spite of illuminations from Holy Writ .</p>
   <p>Next ( to take as near our King as he could ) he calumniates the Duke of Monmouth with that height of impudence , that his Sense is far blacker than his Ink , exposing him to all the censures that a Murderer , a Traytor , or what a Subject of most ambitious evil can possibly comprehend : and it is some wonder , that his Lines also had not hang 'd him on a Tree , to make the intended Absalom more compleat .</p>
   <p>As to my Lord Shaftsbury ( in his collusive Achitophel ) , what does he other than exceed Malice it self ? or that the more prudent deserts of that Peer were to be so impeach 'd before hand by his impious Poem , as that he might be granted more emphatically condign of the Hangman 's Ax ; And which his Muse does in effect take upon her to hasten .</p>
   <p>And if the season be well observ 'd , when this Adulterate Poem was spread , it will be found purposely divulg 'd near the time when this Lord , with his other Noble Partner , were to be brought to their Tryals . And I suppose this Poet thought himself enough assur 'd of their condemnation ; at least , that his Genius had not otherwise ventur 'd to have trampled on persons of such eminent Abilities , and Interest in the Nation . A consideration , I confess , incited my Pen ( its preceding respect being paid to the Duke of Monmouth ) to vindicate their Reputations where I thought it due .</p>
   <p>And some are not a little mistaken in their judgments of persons , if any Kingdom has at this time Two men of their Dignity , of more extraordinary Understandings : Which may ( if well consider 'd ) be some inducement to their future preservation and esteem . As I have endeavour 'd chiefly to clear their abuse , so I have pass 'd divers considerable persons , under as malign inclinations of this Author 's ; conceiving , that what I have said for the Principals , may remove such smaller prejudices as are on the value of others on the same concern .</p>
   <p>His most select and pecuniary Favourites , I have but barely touch 'd , in respect his praise includes a concomitant reprehension , if well apprehended . Besides , I was unwilling to discourage any , that for the future may desire to be admir 'd by him according to their liberality . A method , that perhaps may in time set up some Merchants of Parnassus , where the Indies of Fame seem lately discover 'd , and may be purchas 'd per Centum , according to modern example .</p>
   <p>As to the Character of Amiel , I confess my Lines are something pointed , the one reason being , that it alludes much to a manner of expression of this Writer 's , as may be seen by the marginal Notes ; and a second will be soon allowed . The figure of Amiel has been so squeez 'd into Paint , that his soul is seen in spite of the Varnish .</p>
   <p>And none will deny , but it is as easie to send Truth backward , as it is to spur Falsities egregiously forward , and might have caus 'd any Asse , as knowing as Balaam 's , to have rebuk 'd such a Poet as will needs prophecy against the sense of Heaven and Men . But I have enough of this Amiell , as well as of his Muse , unless that by his means it occasions a further account . And for what is mine here , It will at worst contract censure , in respect it is a brief reflection on a very large Libel . And tho ’ I believe it did not cost ( tho ’ that be not offer 'd for an excuse ) the tenth part of the time of the other . As to my Preface , I was willing that he should find , that this smaller work has some Nose .— Tho ’ I am no more bound to have my Face known by it , than he is willing to obscure his by a Nameless Preamble .</p>

     <l n="5">A Poet there starts up , of wondrous Fame ;</l>

     <l n="10">For ‘ tis not harder much , if we tax Nature ,</l>
     <l n="11">That Lines should give a Poet such a Feature ;</l>
     <l n="12">Than that his Verse a Hero should us show ,</l>

     <l n="23">Should seem ‘ twixt him , and such called Earthly Gods .</l>
     <l n="24">And tho no Wit can Royal Blood infuse ,</l>
     <l n="25">No more than melt a Mother to a Muse :</l>
     <l n="26">Yet much a certain Poet undertook ,</l>
     <l n="27">That Men and Manners deals in without-Book .</l>
     <l n="28">And might not more to Gospel-Truth belong ,</l>
     <l n="29">Than he ( if Christened ) does by name of John .</l>

     <l n="31">Of which some might bring Coyn , whilst some none brought ,</l>

     <l n="35">Had notch 'd his Sconce just level with his Ear .</l>
     <l n="36">An Emblem in these days of much import ,</l>
     <l n="37">When Crop-ear 'd Wits had such a Modish Court .</l>
     <l n="38">Tho some from after-deeds much fear the Fate ,</l>
     <l n="39">That such a Muse may for its Lugs create .</l>
     <l n="40">As Stars may without Pillories dispence ,</l>
     <l n="41">To slit some Ears for Forgeries of sense ,</l>
     <l n="42">Which Princes , Nobles , and the Fame of Men ,</l>
     <l n="43">Sought to bespatter by a worthless Pen .</l>
     <l n="44">But leaving this to Circumstances fit ,</l>
     <l n="45">With what thence spreads this Renegado-wit .</l>

     <l n="47">And what choice Things and Persons he doth take , }</l>

     <l n="58">Must fall adorn 'd , which then they pity least .</l>
     <l n="59">But fear not Monmouth , if a Libel 's quill ,</l>

     <l n="73">What Altitude can more exalt thy Praise ,</l>
     <l n="74">Tho best Devotion should thy Trophies raise ,</l>
     <l n="75">And ‘ tis perhaps from thy Diviner Bliss ,</l>
     <l n="76">That some may fear their Souls are seen amiss .</l>
     <l n="77">As what so high does Emulation mount ,</l>

     <l n="142">As is discern 'd in Shaftsbury 's Great Case ;</l>
     <l n="143">Where Verse so vile an Obloquy betray ,</l>
     <l n="144">As for a Statist-Jew they 'd him convey .</l>
     <l n="145">Tho hard it is to understand what Spell</l>
     <l n="146">Can conjure up in him Achitophel ,</l>
     <l n="147">Or tax this Peer with an Abused Sense</l>
     <l n="148">Of his so deep and apt Intelligence :</l>
     <l n="149">A Promptitude by which the Nation 's shown</l>
     <l n="150">To be in Thought concurrent with his own .</l>
     <l n="151">Shaftsbury ! A Soul that Nature did impart</l>
     <l n="152">To raise her Wonder in a Brain and Heart ;</l>
     <l n="153">Or that in him produc 'd , the World might know ,</l>
     <l n="154">She others did with drooping Thought bestow .</l>
     <l n="155">As in Mans most perspicuous Soul , we find</l>
     <l n="156">The nearest Draught of her Internal Mind ,</l>
     <l n="157">Tho it appears her highest Act of State ,</l>
     <l n="158">When Human Conducts she does most compleat ,</l>
     <l n="159">And place them so , for Mankinds good , that they</l>
     <l n="160">Are fit to Guide , where others miss their Way ;</l>
     <l n="161">It being in Worldly Politiques less Great</l>
     <l n="162">To be a Law-maker , than Preserve a State .</l>
     <l n="163">In Publick Dangers Laws are unsecure ,</l>
     <l n="164">As strongest Anchors can n't all Winds endure ;</l>
     <l n="165">Though ‘ tis in Exigents the wisest Ease</l>
     <l n="166">To know who best can ply when Storms encrease ;</l>
     <l n="167">Whilst other Prospects , by mistaking Fate ,</l>
     <l n="168">Through wrong Preventions , more its Bad dilate .</l>
     <l n="169">Whence some their Counter-Politicks extend ,</l>
     <l n="170">To ruine such can Evils best amend .</l>
     <l n="171">A Thwarting Genius , which our Nation more</l>

     <l n="179">As from a Cubick Power , or Three-fold Might ,</l>
     <l n="180">Roots much expand , as Authors prove aright ;</l>
     <l n="181">But of such Managements we 'll little say ,</l>
     <l n="182">Or shamm 'd Intrigues , for Fame left to convey ;</l>
     <l n="183">Which may by peeping through a Gown-mans Sleeve ,</l>

     <l n="185">With what for Plots and Trials has been done ,</l>
     <l n="186">As Whores depos 'd , before away they run ;</l>
     <l n="187">All which was well discern 'd by numerous Sense ,</l>
     <l n="188">Before the Doctors py 'd Intelligence ,</l>
     <l n="189">Who , with some Motley Lawyers , took much care</l>
     <l n="190">To gain the Caput of this Knowing Peer ;</l>
     <l n="191">When after so much Noise , and nothing prov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="192">Heaven thank 'd , to Freedom he 's at last remov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="193">Leaving a Low-Bridge Cerberus to try</l>
     <l n="194">In what Clerks Pate his monstrous Fee does lie ;</l>
     <l n="195">Or by the help of Tory-Roger tell</l>
     <l n="196">How Sacred Gain-Prerogativ 'd should spell .</l>
     <l n="197">But these are Thoughts may fit some Pensive Skulls ,</l>
     <l n="198">Or Men concern 'd to bait their several Bulls ;</l>
     <l n="199">Whilst on this Peer we must some Lines bestow ,</l>
     <l n="200">Tho more he merits than best Verse can show :</l>
     <l n="201">Great in his Name , but greater in his Parts ,</l>
     <l n="202">Judgment sublim 'd , with all its strong Deserts ;</l>
     <l n="203">A Sense above Occasions quick surprize ,</l>
     <l n="204">That he no Study needs to make him Wise ,</l>
     <l n="205">Or labour 'd Thoughts , that trains of Sinews knit ,</l>
     <l n="206">His Judgment always twin 'd unto his Wit ;</l>
     <l n="207">That from his clear Discussions Men may know</l>
     <l n="208">He does to wonder other Brains out-do .</l>
     <l n="209">Whilst they for Notions search they can n't compact ,</l>
     <l n="210">His Genius fitly stands prepar 'd to act .</l>
     <l n="211">Admir 'd of Man , that in thy Sense alone</l>
     <l n="212">So ready dost exalt high Reason 's Throne ;</l>
     <l n="213">That Men abate Resentments to expect</l>
     <l n="214">Thou mayst rise Greater , having past Neglect .</l>
     <l n="215">A Sacred Method Kings receive from Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="216">That still does Cherish , when it has Forgiven ;</l>
     <l n="217">Which from our Princes Soul so largely flows ,</l>
     <l n="218">That Mercy 's Channel with his Greatness goes .</l>
     <l n="219">No Arbitrary Whispers him can guide</l>
     <l n="220">To swell his Rule beyond its genuine Tide :</l>
     <l n="221">Whilst other Kings their rugged Scepters see</l>
     <l n="222">Eclips 'd in his more soft Felicity ;</l>
     <l n="223">Whose Goodness can all Stress of State remove ,</l>
     <l n="224">So fitly own 'd the Subjects Fear and Love .</l>
     <l n="225">My Verse might here discharge its hasty Flight , }</l>
     <l n="226">As Pencils that attempt Immortal Heighth }</l>
     <l n="227">Droop in the Colours should convey its Light , }</l>
     <l n="228">Did not this Poet 's Lines upon me call</l>
     <l n="229">For some Reflexions on a Lower Fall ;</l>
     <l n="230">Where he by Rhyming , a Judaick Sham ,</l>
     <l n="231">Obtrudes for Israelites some Seeds of Cham .</l>
     <l n="232">And this Inspexion needs no further go</l>
     <l n="233">Than where his Pen does most Indulgent show :</l>
     <l n="234">And ‘ tis no wonder if his Types of Sense</l>
     <l n="235">Should stroke such Figures as give down their Pence ;</l>
     <l n="236">A Crime for which some Poets Lines so stretch ,</l>
     <l n="237">As on themselves they Metaphor Jack Ketch .</l>
     <l n="238">Tho small the Varnish is to Humane Name ,</l>
     <l n="239">Where Cogging Measures rob the truth of Fame .</l>
     <l n="240">And more to do his skew 'd Encomiums right ,</l>
     <l n="241">Some Persons speak by him their motly Sight :</l>
     <l n="242">Or much like Hudibras , on Wits pretence ,</l>
     <l n="243">Some Lines for Rhyme , and some to gingle Sense .</l>
     <l n="244">Who else would Adriel , Jotham , Hushai , fit ,</l>
     <l n="245">With loathed Amiell , for a Court of Wit ?</l>
     <l n="246">For , as Men Squares of Circles hardly find ,</l>
     <l n="247">Some think these Measures are as odly joyn 'd .</l>
     <l n="248">What else could Adriell 's sharpness more abuse ,</l>
     <l n="249">Than headlong dubb 'd , to own himself a Muse ,</l>
     <l n="250">Unless to spread Poetick Honours so</l>
     <l n="251">As should a Muse give each St. George 's Show ?</l>
     <l n="252">A Mode of Glory might Parnassus fit ,</l>
     <l n="253">Tho our Sage Prince knows few he 'd Knight for Wit .</l>
     <l n="254">And thus this Freak is left upon the File ,</l>
     <l n="255">Or as ‘ tis written in this Poet 's Stile .</l>
     <l n="256">Next , as in Course , to Jotham we 'll descend ,</l>
     <l n="257">Thoughtful it seems which Side he 'll next befriend ,</l>
     <l n="258">As thinking Brains can caper to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="259">Before they jump into the Box they 'd go .</l>
     <l n="260">And ‘ tis a moody Age , as many guess ,</l>
     <l n="261">When some with busie Fears still forward press ;</l>
     <l n="262">As ‘ tis Ambitions oft-deluding Cheat</l>
     <l n="263">To tempt Mens aims , secureless of defeat .</l>
     <l n="264">Hushai the Compass of th'Exchequer guides ,</l>
     <l n="265">Propense enough unto the North besides :</l>
     <l n="266">As what can steady Stations more allure ,</l>

   <p>AZARIA AND HUSHAI ,</p>
   <p>A POEM .</p>
   <p>Quod cuique visum est sentiant .</p>
   <p>LONDON , Printed for Charles Lee , An . Dom . 1682 .</p>
   <p>TO THE READER .</p>
   <p>I shall not go about , either to excuse , or justifie the Publishing of this Poem ; for that would be much more an harder Task than the Writing of it : But however , I shall say , in the words of the Author of the incomparable Absalom and Achitophel , That I am sure the Design is honest . If Wit and Fool be the Consequence of Whig and Tory , no doubt , but Knave and Ass may be Epithets plentifully bestowed upon me by the one party , whilst the other may grant me more favourable ones , than perhaps I do deserve . But as very few are Judges of Wit , so I think , much fewer of honesty ; since Interest and Faction on either side , prejudices and blinds the Judgment ; and the violence of Passion makes neither discernible in an Adversary . I know not whether my Poem has a Genius to force its way against prejudice : Opinion sways much in the World , and he that has once gained it writes securely . I speak not this any ways to lessen the merits of an Author , whose Wit has deservedly gained the Bays ; but in this I have the advantage , since , as I desire not Glory or vain applause , I can securely wrap my self in my own Cloud , and remain unknown , whilest he is exposed through his great Lustre . I shall never envy what I desire not , nor am I altogether so doting , as to believe the Issues of my own Brain to exceed all others , and to be so very fond of them , ( as most Authors , especially Poets , are ) as to think them without fault , or be so blinded as not to see their blemishes , and that they are excelled by others ; yet since Poems are like Children , it may be allowed me to be naturally inclined to have some good Opinion of my own , and not to believe this Poem altogether despicable or ridiculous . The Ancients say , that every thing hath two handles , I have laid hold of that opposite to the Author of Absalom : As to Truth , who has the better hold , let the World judge ; and it is no new thing , for the same Persons , to be ill or well represented , by several parties . I hope then , I may be excused as well as another , since I have told my Dreams with the same Liberty , for the fancies of Poets are no more than waking Dreams , and never imposed as dogmatical precepts , which are more agreeable to truth or falshood , or according to the Poets Language , which proceed from the Horny or Ivory Port , will be sentenced according to the Humour and Interest of several Parties who in spite of our Teeth will be our judges . Where I have been satyrical , ‘ tis without Malice or Revenge ; and though I brag not of my Talent therein , I could have said much worse , of some Enemies to our Jewish Heroe . He that will lash others , ought not to be angry if the like be returned to himself : Lex talionis is a general and natural Law . I call not this an Answer to Absalom , I have nothing to do with him , he was a Rebel to his Father ; my Azaria a good Son , influenced by a worthy and Loyal Counsellor , and Achitophel and Hushai were men of contrary Opinions , and different Principles : And if Poets ( as it is often brought for their excuse , when they vary from known History ) ought to represent Persons as they ought to be , I have not transcurred the Precepts of Poetry , and Absalom is not so good a Poem , because his Character is not so agreeable to the virtue of an Heroe , as this of Azaria is : But certainly when Poetry and Truth are joyned together , and that the persons are truly what they are represented , and liv 'd their Character , the glory is double , both to the Heroe and the Poet : And I could wish , that the same Hand , that drew the Rebellious Son , with so much Ingenuity and Skill , would out do mine , in shewing the virtues of an obedient Son and loyal Counsellor , since he may have as much Truth for a Foundation to build upon , the Artful Structure of the Heroes Glory , with his own Fame and Immortality .</p>

     <l n="1">In Impious Times , when Priest-craft was at height ,</l>
     <l n="2">And all the Deadly Sins esteemed light ;</l>
     <l n="3">When that Religion only was a Stale ,</l>
     <l n="4">And some bow 'd down to God , and some to Baal ;</l>
     <l n="5">When Perjury was scarce esteem 'd a Sin ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Vice , like flowing Tides , came rowling in ;</l>
     <l n="7">When Luxury , Debauch , and Concubine ,</l>
     <l n="8">The sad Effects of Women and of Wine ,</l>
     <l n="9">Rag 'd in Judea and Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="10">Good Amazia of great David 's Stem ,</l>
     <l n="11">God-like and great in Peace did rule that Land ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all the Jews stoop 'd to his just Command .</l>
     <l n="13">Long now in Sion had he Peace enjoy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="14">After that Civil Broils the Land destroy 'd :</l>
     <l n="15">Plenty and Peace attended on his Reign ,</l>
     <l n="16">And Solomon 's Golden days return 'd again ;</l>
     <l n="17">When the Old Canaanites , who there did lurk ,</l>
     <l n="18">Began to find both God and King new Work :</l>
     <l n="19">For Amazia , tho ’ he God did love ,</l>
     <l n="20">Had not cast out Baal 's Priests , and cut down every Grove .</l>
     <l n="21">Too oft Religion 's made pretence for Sin ,</l>
     <l n="22">About it in all Ages Strife has been ;</l>
     <l n="23">But Int'rest , which at bottom doth remain ,</l>
     <l n="24">Which still converts all Godliness to Gain ,</l>
     <l n="25">What e'er Pretence is made , is the true Cause ,</l>
     <l n="26">That moves the Priest , and like the Load-stone draws .</l>
     <l n="27">The Canaanites of Old that Land possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="28">And long therein Idolatry profess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="29">Till Sins of Priests , and of the Common Rout ,</l>
     <l n="30">Caus 'd God and his good Kings to cast them out .</l>
     <l n="31">Their Idols were pull 'd down , their Groves destroy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="32">Strict Laws against them , and their Worship made .</l>
     <l n="33">The Heathen Priests were banish 'd from the Land</l>
     <l n="34">Of Baal , no Temple suffer 'd was to stand ;</l>
     <l n="35">And all Succeeding Kings made it their Care ,</l>
     <l n="36">They should no more rear up their Altars there .</l>
     <l n="37">If some mild Kings did wink at their Abode ,</l>
     <l n="38">They to the Jews still prov 'd a Pricking-goad :</l>
     <l n="39">Growing more bold , they penal Laws defy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="40">And like tormenting Thorns , stuck in their Side .</l>
     <l n="41">The busy Priests had lost their gainful Trade ,</l>
     <l n="42">Revenge and Malice do then Hearts invade ;</l>
     <l n="43">And since by Force they can n't themselves restore ,</l>
     <l n="44">Nor gain the Sway they in Judea bore ,</l>
     <l n="45">With Hell they Joyn their secret Plots to bring</l>

     <l n="680">The Noble Youth , with Vertues Robes arrai 'd ,</l>
     <l n="681">Consider 'd well what the wise Hushai said .</l>
     <l n="682">Desire of Power , though of Celestial Birth ,</l>
     <l n="683">Below , is ever intermixt with Earth :</l>
     <l n="684">And all who do to hight of Place aspire ,</l>

     <l n="686">Praise may debauch , and strong Ambition blind ,</l>
     <l n="687">Where heav'nly Vertue does not guard the Mind .</l>
     <l n="688">But Azaria so well understood ,</l>
     <l n="689">He left the Evil , and embrac 'd the Good :</l>
     <l n="690">Tho in his breast aspiring thoughts he found ,</l>
     <l n="691">Yet Loyalty still kept them within bound .</l>
     <l n="692">And tho he might have Empire in his Eye ,</l>
     <l n="693">When to it by his bloud allay 'd so nigh ,</l>
     <l n="694">Yet in his Soul such Virtue did remain ,</l>
     <l n="695">He by Rebellion would not Empire gain .</l>
     <l n="696">Through every Vein his Loyal Bloud did run ,</l>
     <l n="697">Yet Royal too , as Amazia 's Son .</l>
     <l n="698">About his noble Heart he felt it spring ;</l>
     <l n="699">Which let him know his Father was a King .</l>
     <l n="700">If that to Azaria were a Blot ,</l>
     <l n="701">His Father made it when he him begot :</l>
     <l n="702">But Heav'n such Virtue moulded with his Soul ,</l>
     <l n="703">That his aspiring Lust it did controul .</l>
     <l n="704">Thus to wise Hushai he repli 'd : I finde</l>
     <l n="705">Your Counsel is agreeing with my Minde .</l>
     <l n="706">And tho my Foes me an ill man do make ,</l>
     <l n="707">My Loyalty I never will forsake :</l>

     <l n="712">Or never had been born a Royal Blot !</l>
     <l n="713">My Father 's Bloud runs thorow every Vein ; }</l>
     <l n="714">He form 'd those Spirits which desire to reign , }</l>
     <l n="715">Mount t'wards a Throne , and sordid Earth disdain . }</l>
     <l n="716">In Glory , Fame , Crowns , Empire , they delight ,</l>
     <l n="717">And to all these they would assert my Right .</l>
     <l n="718">And my great Thoughts do whisper there is none</l>
     <l n="719">Can be more neer a Father , than his Son .</l>
     <l n="720">This prompts me to oppose Eliakim ,</l>
