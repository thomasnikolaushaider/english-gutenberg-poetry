    <head>THE CASE OF CONSCIENCE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THOSE who in fables deal , bestow at ease</l>
     <l n="2">Both names and titles , freely as they please .</l>
     <l n="3">It costs them scarcely any thing , we find .</l>
     <l n="4">And each is nymph or shepherdess designed ;</l>
     <l n="5">Some e'en are goddesses , that move below ,</l>
     <l n="6">From whom celestial bliss of course must flow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">THIS Horace followed , with superior art :—</l>
     <l n="8">If , to the trav'ller ' s bed , with throbbing heart ,</l>
     <l n="9">The chambermaid approached , ‘ twas Ilia found ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or fair Egeria , or some nymph renowned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">GOD , in his goodness , made , one lovely day ,</l>
     <l n="12">Apollo , who directs the lyrick lay ,</l>
     <l n="13">And gave him pow'rs to call and name at will ,</l>
     <l n="14">Like father Adam , with primordial skill .</l>
     <l n="15">Said he , go , names bestow that please the ear ;</l>
     <l n="16">In ev'ry word let sweetest sound appear .</l>
     <l n="17">This ancient law then proves , by right divine ,</l>
     <l n="18">WE oft are sponsors to the royal line .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">WHEN pleasing tales and fables I endite ,</l>
     <l n="20">I , who in humble verse presume to write ,</l>
     <l n="21">May surely use this privilege of old ,</l>
     <l n="22">And , to my fancy , appellations mould .</l>
     <l n="23">If I , instead of Anne , should Sylvia say ,</l>
     <l n="24">And Master Thomas ( when the case I weigh )</l>
     <l n="25">Should change to Adamas , the druid sage ,</l>
     <l n="26">Must I a fine or punishment engage ?</l>
     <l n="27">No , surely not :— at present I shall choose</l>
     <l n="28">Anne and the Parson for my tale to use .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">WITHIN her village , Anne was thought the belle ,</l>
     <l n="30">And ev'ry other charmer to excel .</l>
     <l n="31">As near a river once she chanced to stray ,</l>
     <l n="32">She saw a youth in Nature 's pure array ,</l>
     <l n="33">Who bathed at ease within the gliding stream ;</l>
     <l n="34">The girl was brisk , and worthy of esteem ,</l>
     <l n="35">Her eyes were pleased ; the object gave delight ;</l>
     <l n="36">Not one defect could be produced in sight ;</l>
     <l n="37">Already , by the shepherdess adored ,</l>
     <l n="38">If with the belle to pleasing flights he 'd soared ,</l>
     <l n="39">The god of love had all they wished concealed</l>
     <l n="40">None better know what should not be revealed .</l>
     <l n="41">Anne nothing feared : the willows were her shade ,</l>
     <l n="42">Which , like Venetian blinds , a cov'ring made ;</l>
     <l n="43">Her eyes , howe'er , across had easy view ,</l>
     <l n="44">And , o'er the youth , each beauty could pursue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="45">SHE back four paces drew , at first , through shame ;</l>
     <l n="46">Then , led by LOVE , eight others forward came ;</l>
     <l n="47">But scruples still arose that ardour foiled ,</l>
     <l n="48">And nearly ey'ry thing had truly spoiled .</l>
     <l n="49">Anne had a conscience pure as holy fire ;</l>
     <l n="50">But how could she abstain from soft desire ?</l>
     <l n="51">If , in the bosom chance a flame should raise ,</l>
     <l n="52">Is there a pow'r can then subdue the blaze ?</l>
     <l n="53">At first these inclinations she withstood ;</l>
     <l n="54">But doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood</l>
     <l n="55">Could sins commit by stepping in advance ,</l>
     <l n="56">She took her seat upon the green expanse ,</l>
     <l n="57">And there attentively the lad observed ,</l>
     <l n="58">With eyes that scarcely from him ever swerved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="59">PERHAPS you 've seen , from Nature , drawings made ?</l>
     <l n="60">Some Eve , or Adam , artists then persuade ,</l>
     <l n="61">In birth-attire to stand within their view ,</l>
     <l n="62">While they with care and taste each trait pursue ;</l>
     <l n="63">And , like our shepherdess , their stations take ,</l>
     <l n="64">A perfect semblance ev'ry way to make .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">ANNE in her mem'ry now his image placed ;</l>
     <l n="66">Each line and feature thoroughly she traced ,</l>
     <l n="67">And even now the fair would there remain ,</l>
     <l n="68">If William ( so was called this youthful swain )</l>
     <l n="69">Had not the water left ; when she retired ,</l>
     <l n="70">Though scarcely twenty steps from him admired ,</l>
     <l n="71">Who , more alert than usual then appeared ,</l>
     <l n="72">And , by the belle , in silence was revered .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">WHEN such sensations once were in the breast ,</l>
     <l n="74">Love there we may believe would hardly rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="75">THE favours Anne reserved he thought his own ,</l>
     <l n="76">Though expectations oft away have flown .</l>
     <l n="77">The more of this I think , the less I know ;</l>
     <l n="78">Perhaps one half our bliss to chance we owe !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="79">BE this as ‘ twill , the conscientious Anne</l>
     <l n="80">Would nothing venture to regale her man ;</l>
     <l n="81">Howe'er , she stated what had raised her fear ,</l>
     <l n="82">And ev'ry thing that made her persevere .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="83">WHEN Easter came , new difficulties rose</l>
     <l n="84">Then , in confession , ALL she should disclose .</l>
     <l n="85">Anne , passing peccadillos in review ,</l>
     <l n="86">This case aside , as an intruder threw ;</l>
     <l n="87">But parson Thomas made her all relate ;</l>
     <l n="88">And ev'ry circumstance most clearly state ;</l>
     <l n="89">That he , by knowing fully each defect ,</l>
     <l n="90">Might punishment accordingly direct ,</l>
     <l n="91">In which no father-confessor should err ,</l>
     <l n="92">Who absolution justly would confer .</l>
     <l n="93">The parson much his penitent abused ;</l>
     <l n="94">Said he , with sensual views to be amused ,</l>
     <l n="95">Is such a sin , ‘ tis scarcely worse to steal ;</l>
     <l n="96">The sight is just the same as if you feel .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="97">HOWE'ER , the punishment that he imposed</l>
     <l n="98">Was nothing great :— too slight to be disclosed ;</l>
     <l n="99">Enough to say , that in the country round ,</l>
     <l n="100">The father-confessors , who there abound ,</l>
     <l n="101">As in our own , ( perhaps in ev'ry part ,)</l>
     <l n="102">Have devotees , who , when they ought to smart ,</l>
     <l n="103">A tribute pay , according to their lot ,</l>
     <l n="104">And thus indulgences are often got .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="105">THIS tribute to discharge the current year ,</l>
     <l n="106">Much troubled Anne , and filled her breast with fear ,</l>
     <l n="107">When William , fishing , chanced a pike to hook ,</l>
     <l n="108">And gave it to his dear at once to cook ,</l>
     <l n="109">Who , quite delighted , hastened to the priest ,</l>
     <l n="110">And begged his rev'rence on the fish to feast .</l>
     <l n="111">The parson with the present much was pleased ;</l>
     <l n="112">A tap upon the shoulder care appeased ;</l>
     <l n="113">And with a smile he to the bringer said</l>
     <l n="114">This fish , with trifles on the table spread ,</l>
     <l n="115">Will all complete ; ‘ twas holyday we find ,</l>
     <l n="116">When other clergy with our rector dined .</l>
     <l n="117">Will you still more oblige , the parson cried ,</l>
     <l n="118">And let the fish at home by you be fried ?</l>
     <l n="119">Then bring it here :— my servant 's very new ,</l>
     <l n="120">And can n't attempt to cook as well as you .</l>
     <l n="121">Anne hastened back ; meanwhile the priests arrived ,</l>
     <l n="122">Much noise , and rout of course , once these were hived ;</l>
     <l n="123">Wines from the vault were brought without delay ;</l>
     <l n="124">Each of the quality would something say .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="125">THE dinner served ; the dean at table placed ;</l>
     <l n="126">Their conversation various points embraced ;</l>
     <l n="127">To state the whole would clearly endless be ;</l>
     <l n="128">In this no doubt the reader will agree .</l>
     <l n="129">They changed and changed , and healths went round and round ;</l>
     <l n="130">No time for scandal while such cheer was found ;</l>
     <l n="131">The first and second course away were cleared ,</l>
     <l n="132">Dessert served up , yet still no pike appeared .</l>
     <l n="133">The dinner o'er without th ’ expected dish ,</l>
     <l n="134">Or even a shadow of the promised fish .</l>
     <l n="135">When William learned the present Anne had made ,</l>
     <l n="136">His wish , to have it cancelled , with her weighed .</l>
     <l n="137">The rector was surprised , you may suppose ,</l>
     <l n="138">And , soon as from the table all arose ,</l>
     <l n="139">He went to Anne , and called her fool and knave ,</l>
     <l n="140">And , in his wrath , could scarcely secrets wave ,</l>
     <l n="141">But nearly her reproached the bathing scene ;</l>
     <l n="142">What , treat , said he , your priest like base and mean ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="143">ANNE archly answered , with expression neat :—</l>
     <l n="144">The sight is just the same as if you eat !</l>

    <head>THE DEVIL OF POPE-FIG ISLAND</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">BY master Francis clearly ‘ tis expressed :</l>
     <l n="2">The folks of Papimania are blessed ;</l>
     <l n="3">True sleep for them alone it seems was made</l>
     <l n="4">With US the copy only has been laid ;</l>
     <l n="5">And by Saint John , if Heav'n my life will spare ,</l>
     <l n="6">I 'll see this place where sleeping ‘ s free from care .</l>
     <l n="7">E'en better still I find , for naught they do :</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis that employment always I pursue .</l>
     <l n="9">Just add thereto a little honest love ,</l>
     <l n="10">And I shall be as easy as a glove .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">ON t'other hand an island may be seen ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where all are hated , cursed , and full of spleen .</l>
     <l n="13">We know them by the thinness of their face</l>
     <l n="14">Long sleep is quite excluded from their race .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">SHOULD you , good reader , any person meet ,</l>
     <l n="16">With rosy , smiling looks , and cheeks replete ,</l>
     <l n="17">The form not clumsy , you may safely say ,</l>
     <l n="18">A Papimanian doubtless I survey .</l>
     <l n="19">But if , on t'other side , you chance to view ,</l>
     <l n="20">A meagre figure , void of blooming hue ,</l>
     <l n="21">With stupid , heavy eye , and gloomy mien</l>
     <l n="22">Conclude at once a Pope-figer , you 've seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">POPE-FIG ‘ S the name upon an isle bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="24">Where once a fig the silly people showed ,</l>
     <l n="25">As like the pope , and due devotion paid :—</l>
     <l n="26">By folly , blocks have often gods been made !</l>
     <l n="27">These islanders were punished for their crime ;</l>
     <l n="28">Naught prospers , Francis tells us , in their clime ;</l>
     <l n="29">To Lucifer was giv'n the hateful spot ,</l>
     <l n="30">And there his country house he now has got .</l>
     <l n="31">His underlings appear throughout the isle ,</l>
     <l n="32">Rude , wretched , poor , mean , sordid , base , and vile ;</l>
     <l n="33">With tales , and horns , and claws , if we believe ,</l>
     <l n="34">What many say who ought not to deceive .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">ONE day it happened that a cunning clown</l>
     <l n="36">Was by an imp observed , without the town ,</l>
     <l n="37">To turn the earth , which seemed to be accurst ,</l>
     <l n="38">Since ev'ry trench was painful as the first .</l>
     <l n="39">This youthful devil was a titled lord ;</l>
     <l n="40">In manners simple :— naught to be abhorred ;</l>
     <l n="41">He might , so ignorant , be duped at ease ;</l>
     <l n="42">As yet he 'd scarcely ventured to displease :</l>
     <l n="43">Said he , I 'd have thee know , I was not born ,</l>
     <l n="44">Like clods to labour , dig nor sow the corn ;</l>
     <l n="45">A devil thou in me beholdest here ,</l>
     <l n="46">Of noble race : to toil I ne'er appear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="47">THOU know'st full well , these fields to us belong :</l>
     <l n="48">The islanders , it seems , had acted wrong ;</l>
     <l n="49">And , for their crimes , the pope withdrew his cares ;</l>
     <l n="50">Our subjects now you live , the law declares ;</l>
     <l n="51">And therefore , fellow , I 've undoubted right ,</l>
     <l n="52">To take the produce of this field , at sight ;</l>
     <l n="53">But I am kind , and clearly will decide</l>
     <l n="54">The year concluded , we 'll the fruits divided .</l>
     <l n="55">What crop , pray tell me , dost thou mean to sow ?</l>
     <l n="56">The clod replied , my lord , what best will grow</l>
     <l n="57">I think is Tousell ; grain of hardy fame ;</l>
     <l n="58">The imp rejoined , I never heard its name ;</l>
     <l n="59">What is it . Tousell , say'st thou ?— I agree ,</l>
     <l n="60">If good return , ‘ twill be the same to me ;</l>
     <l n="61">Work fellow , work ; make haste , the ground prepare ;</l>
     <l n="62">To dig and delve should be the rabble 's care ;</l>
     <l n="63">Do n't think that I will ever lend a hand ,</l>
     <l n="64">Or give the slightest aid to till the land ;</l>
     <l n="65">I 've told thee I 'm a gentleman by birth ,</l>
     <l n="66">Designed for ease : not doomed to turn the earth .</l>
     <l n="67">Howe'er I 'll now the diff'rent parts allot ,</l>
     <l n="68">And thus divide the produce of the plot :—</l>
     <l n="69">What shall above the heritage arise ,</l>
     <l n="70">I 'll leave to thee ; ‘ twill very well suffice ;</l>
     <l n="71">But what is in the soil shall be my share ;</l>
     <l n="72">To this attend , see ev'ry thing is fair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="73">THIS beardless corn when ripe , with joy was reaped ,</l>
     <l n="74">And then the stubble by the roots was heaped ,</l>
     <l n="75">To satisfy the lordly devil 's claim ,</l>
     <l n="76">Who thought the seed and root were just the same ,</l>
     <l n="77">And that the ear and stalk were useless parts ,</l>
     <l n="78">Which nothing made if carried to the marts :</l>
     <l n="79">The labourer his produce housed with care ;</l>
     <l n="80">The other to the market brought his ware ,</l>
     <l n="81">Where ridicule and laughter he received ;</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Twas nothing worth , which much his bosom grieved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="83">QUITE mortified , the devil quickly went ;</l>
     <l n="84">To seek our clod , and mark his discontent :</l>
     <l n="85">The fellow had discreetly sold the corn ,</l>
     <l n="86">In straw , unthrashed , and off the money borne ,</l>
     <l n="87">Which he , with ev'ry wily care , concealed ;</l>
     <l n="88">The imp was duped , and nothing was revealed .</l>
     <l n="89">Said he , thou rascal ?— pretty tricks thou'st played ;</l>
     <l n="90">It seems that cheating is thy daily trade ;</l>
     <l n="91">But I 'm a noble devil of the court ,</l>
     <l n="92">Who tricking never knew , save by report .</l>
     <l n="93">What grain dost mean to sow th ’ ensuing year ?</l>
     <l n="94">The labourer replied , I think it clear ,</l>
     <l n="95">Instead of grain , ‘ twill better be to chop ,</l>
     <l n="96">And take a carrot , or a turnip crop ;</l>
     <l n="97">You then , my lord , will surely plenty find ;</l>
     <l n="98">And radishes , if you are so inclined .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
