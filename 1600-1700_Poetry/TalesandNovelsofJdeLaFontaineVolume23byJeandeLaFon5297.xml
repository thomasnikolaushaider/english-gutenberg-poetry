    <head>THE RIVER SCAMANDER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I 'M now disposed to give a pretty tale ;</l>
     <l n="2">Love laughs at what I 've sworn and will prevail ;</l>
     <l n="3">Men , gods , and all , his mighty influence know ,</l>
     <l n="4">And full obedience to the urchin show .</l>
     <l n="5">In future when I celebrate his flame ,</l>
     <l n="6">Expressions not so warm will be my aim ;</l>
     <l n="7">I would not willingly abuses plant ,</l>
     <l n="8">But rather let my writings spirit want .</l>
     <l n="9">If in these verses I around should twirl ,</l>
     <l n="10">Some wily knave and easy simple girl ,</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Tis with intention in the breast to place ;</l>
     <l n="12">On such occasions , dread of dire disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="13">The mind to open , and the sex to set</l>
     <l n="14">Upon their guard ‘ gainst snares so often met .</l>
     <l n="15">Gross ignorance a thousand has misled ,</l>
     <l n="16">For one that has been hurt by what I 've said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">I 'VE read that once , an orator renowned</l>
     <l n="18">In Greece , where arts superior then were found ,</l>
     <l n="19">By law 's severe decree , compelled to quit</l>
     <l n="20">His country , and to banishment submit ,</l>
     <l n="21">Resolved that he a season would employ ,</l>
     <l n="22">In visiting the site of ancient Troy .</l>
     <l n="23">His comrade , Cymon , with him thither went ,</l>
     <l n="24">To view those ruins , we so oft lament .</l>
     <l n="25">A hamlet had been raised from Ilion 's wall ,</l>
     <l n="26">Ennobled by misfortune and its fall ;</l>
     <l n="27">Where now mere names are Priam and his court ;</l>
     <l n="28">Of all devouring Time the prey and sport .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">O TROY ! for me thy very name has got</l>
     <l n="30">Superior charms :— in story fruitful spot ;</l>
     <l n="31">Thy famed remains I ne'er can hope to view ,</l>
     <l n="32">That gods by labour raised , and gods o'erthrew ;</l>
     <l n="33">Those fields where daring acts of valour shone ;</l>
     <l n="34">So many fights were lost :— so many won .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">BUT to resume my thread , and not extend</l>
     <l n="36">Too much the subjects which our plan suspend ;</l>
     <l n="37">This Cymon , who 's the hero of our tale ,</l>
     <l n="38">When walking near the banks that form the dale</l>
     <l n="39">Through which Scamander 's waters freely flow ,</l>
     <l n="40">Observed a youthful charmer thither go ,</l>
     <l n="41">To breathe the cool refreshing breeze around ;</l>
     <l n="42">That on its verdant borders oft she 'd found .</l>
     <l n="43">Her veil was floating , and her artless dress ,</l>
     <l n="44">A shepherdess seemed clearly to express .</l>
     <l n="45">Tall , elegantly formed , with beauteous mien ,</l>
     <l n="46">And ev'ry feature lovely to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="47">Young Cymon felt emotion and surprise ,</l>
     <l n="48">And thought ‘ twas Venus that had caught his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="49">Who on the river 's side her charms displayed ,</l>
     <l n="50">Those wondrous treasures all perfection made .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="51">A GROT was nigh , to which the simple fair ,</l>
     <l n="52">Not dreaming ills , was anxious to repair ;</l>
     <l n="53">The heat , some evil spirit , and the place ,</l>
     <l n="54">Invited her the moment to embrace ,</l>
     <l n="55">To bathe within the stream that near her ran ;</l>
     <l n="56">And instantly her project she began .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="57">THE spark concealed himself ; each charm admired ;</l>
     <l n="58">Now this , now that , now t'other feature fired ;</l>
     <l n="59">A hundred beauties caught his eager sight ;</l>
     <l n="60">And while his bosom felt supreme delight ,</l>
     <l n="61">He turned his thoughts advantages to take ,</l>
     <l n="62">And of the maiden 's error something make ;</l>
     <l n="63">Assumed the character , and dress ; and air ;</l>
     <l n="64">That should a wat'ry deity declare ;</l>
     <l n="65">Within the gliding flood his vestments dipt :</l>
     <l n="66">A crown of rushes on his head he slipt ;</l>
     <l n="67">Aquatick herbs and plants around he twined :</l>
     <l n="68">Then Mercury intreated to be kind ,</l>
     <l n="69">And Cupid too , the wily god of hearts ;</l>
     <l n="70">How could the innocent resist these arts ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="71">AT length a foot so fair the belle exposed ,</l>
     <l n="72">E'en Galatea never such disclosed ;</l>
     <l n="73">The stream , that glided by , received the prize ;</l>
     <l n="74">Her lilies she beheld with downcast eyes ,</l>
     <l n="75">And , half ashamed , herself surveyed at ease ,</l>
     <l n="76">While round the zephyrs wantoned in the breeze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="77">WHEN thus engaged , the lover near her drew ;</l>
     <l n="78">At whose approach away the damsel flew ,</l>
     <l n="79">And tried to hide within the rocky cell ;</l>
     <l n="80">Cried Cymon , I beneath these waters dwell ,</l>
     <l n="81">And o'er their course a sov'reign right maintain ;</l>
     <l n="82">Be goddess of the flood , and with me reign ;</l>
     <l n="83">Few rivers could with you like pow'rs divide ;</l>
     <l n="84">My crystal 's clear : in me you may confide ;</l>
     <l n="85">My heart is pure ; with flow'rs I 'll deck the stream ,</l>
     <l n="86">If worthy of yourself the flood you deem ;</l>
     <l n="87">Too happy should this honour you bestow ,</l>
     <l n="88">And with me , ‘ neath the current , freely go .</l>
     <l n="89">Your fair companions , ev'ry one I 'll make</l>
     <l n="90">A nymph of fountains , hill , or grove , or lake ;</l>
     <l n="91">My pow'r is great , extending far around</l>
     <l n="92">Where'er the eye can reach , ‘ tis fully found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="93">THE eloquence he used , her fears and dread ;</l>
     <l n="94">Lest she might give offence by what she said ,</l>
     <l n="95">In spite of bashfulness that bliss alloys ,</l>
     <l n="96">Soon all concluded with celestial joys .</l>
     <l n="97">‘ Tis even said that Cupid lent supplies ;</l>
     <l n="98">From superstition many things arise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="99">THE spark withdrew , delighted by success ;</l>
     <l n="100">Return said he :— we 'll mutually caress ;</l>
     <l n="101">But secret prove : let none our union learn ;</l>
     <l n="102">Concealment is to me of high concern ;</l>
     <l n="103">To make it publick would improper be ,</l>
     <l n="104">Till on Olympus ’ mount the gods we see ,</l>
     <l n="105">In council met , to whom I 'll state the case ;</l>
     <l n="106">On this the new-made goddess left the place ,</l>
     <l n="107">In ev'ry thing contented as a dove ,</l>
     <l n="108">And fully witnessed by the god of love .</l>
     <l n="109">Two months had passed , and not a person knew</l>
     <l n="110">Their frequent meetings , pleasure to pursue .</l>
     <l n="111">O mortals ! is it true , as we are told ,</l>
     <l n="112">That ev'ry bliss at last is rendered cold ?</l>
     <l n="113">The sly gallant , though not a word he said ,</l>
     <l n="114">The grot to visit now was rarely led .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="115">AT length a wedding much attention caught ;</l>
     <l n="116">The lads and lasses of the hamlet sought ,</l>
     <l n="117">To see the couple pass : the belle perceived</l>
     <l n="118">The very man for whom her bosom heaved ,</l>
     <l n="119">And loudly cried , behold Scamander 's flood !</l>
     <l n="120">Which raised surprise ; soon numbers round her stood ,</l>
     <l n="121">Astonishment expressed , but still the fair ,</l>
     <l n="122">Whate'er was asked , would nothing more declare ,</l>
     <l n="123">Than , in the spacious , blue , ethereal sky ,</l>
     <l n="124">Her marriage would be soon , they might rely .</l>
     <l n="125">A laugh prevailed ; for what was to be done ?</l>
     <l n="126">The god with hasty steps away had run ,</l>
     <l n="127">And none with stones pursued his rapid flight :</l>
     <l n="128">The deity was quickly ought of sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="129">WERE this to happen now , Scamander 's stream</l>
     <l n="130">Would not so easily preserve esteem ;</l>
     <l n="131">But crimes like these ( whoever was abused ) ,</l>
     <l n="132">In former days , were easily excused .</l>
     <l n="133">With time our maxims change , and what was then ,</l>
     <l n="134">Though wrong at present , may prevail agen .</l>
     <l n="135">Scamander 's spouse some raillery received ;</l>
     <l n="136">But in the end she fully was relieved :</l>
     <l n="137">A lover e'en superior thought her charms ,</l>
     <l n="138">( His taste was such ) and took her to his arms .</l>
     <l n="139">The gods can nothing spoil ! but should they cause</l>
     <l n="140">A belle to lose a portion of applause ,</l>
     <l n="141">A handsome fortune give , and you 'll behold ,</l>
     <l n="142">That ev'ry thing can be repaired by gold .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A CONFIDANT WITHOUT KNOWING IT ; OR THE STRATAGEM</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NO master sage , nor orator I know ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who can success , like gentle Cupid show ;</l>
     <l n="3">His ways and arguments are pleasing smiles ,</l>
     <l n="4">Engaging looks , soft tears , and winning wiles .</l>
     <l n="5">Wars in his empire will at times arise ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , in the field , his standard meet the eyes ;</l>
     <l n="7">Now stealing secretly , with skilful lure .</l>
     <l n="8">He penetrates to hearts supposed secure ,</l>
     <l n="9">O'erleaps the ramparts that protect around ,</l>
     <l n="10">And citadels reduces , most renowned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">I DARE engage , two fortresses besiege</l>
     <l n="12">Leave one to Mars , and t'other to this liege .</l>
     <l n="13">And though the god of war should numbers bring ,</l>
     <l n="14">With all the arms that can his thunders fling ,</l>
     <l n="15">Before the fort he 'll vainly waste his time ,</l>
     <l n="16">While Cupid , unattended , in shall climb ,</l>
     <l n="17">Obtain possession perfectly at ease ,</l>
     <l n="18">And grant conditions just as he shall please .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">I NOW propose to give a fav'rite tale :—</l>
     <l n="20">The god of Love was never known to fail ,</l>
     <l n="21">In finding stratagems , as I have read ,</l>
     <l n="22">And many have I seen most nicely spread .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">THE young Aminta was Gerontes ’ wife ,</l>
     <l n="24">With whom she lived , it seems , a wretched life .</l>
     <l n="25">Far better she deserved than what she had ,</l>
     <l n="26">For he was jealous , and his temper bad :</l>
     <l n="27">An aged hunks , while she was in the hour</l>
     <l n="28">When hearts , that never felt LOVE 'S mighty pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="29">Are presently by tender objects caught ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which ne'er before had entered in the thought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="31">WHEN first Aminta saw young Cleon 's face ,</l>
     <l n="32">A lad possessing all engaging grace ,</l>
     <l n="33">Much prudence then she ev'ry way displayed ,</l>
     <l n="34">E'en more perhaps than necessary made .</l>
     <l n="35">For though we may suppose the lovely fair ,</l>
     <l n="36">Would ev'ry effort use to ‘ scape the snare ,</l>
     <l n="37">Yet when the god of soft persuasion takes</l>
     <l n="38">The fatal moment , havock soon he makes ,</l>
     <l n="39">In vain his duty , any thing opposed ,</l>
     <l n="40">If once the tender sentiment 's disclosed .</l>
     <l n="41">Aminta consolation had in view</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Twas that alone the passion from her drew ,</l>
     <l n="43">A meeting innocent , to vent her tears ,</l>
     <l n="44">And , to a feeling friend , express her fears .</l>
     <l n="45">‘ Tis represented thus I cannot doubt ;</l>
     <l n="46">But sight of meat brings appetite about ;</l>
     <l n="47">And if you would avoid the tempting bit ,</l>
     <l n="48">‘ Tis better far at table not to sit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">AMINTA hoped to render Cleon kind ;</l>
     <l n="50">Poor innocent ! as yet to dangers blind ,</l>
     <l n="51">These conversations she was led to deem ,</l>
     <l n="52">Mere friendly ways that raised sincere esteem ;</l>
     <l n="53">And this alone she ardently desired ,</l>
     <l n="54">Without supposing more would be required ,</l>
     <l n="55">Or any thing improper be the case :</l>
     <l n="56">She 'd rather die than suffer such disgrace .</l>
     <l n="57">‘ Twas difficult the business to commence ;</l>
     <l n="58">A letter ‘ s often lost , or gives offence ,</l>
     <l n="59">And many serious accidents arrive :</l>
     <l n="60">To have a confidant ‘ twere better strive ;</l>
     <l n="61">But where could such a female friend be found ?</l>
     <l n="62">Gerontes dreaded was by all around .</l>
     <l n="63">I 've said already , Cupid will obtain ,</l>
     <l n="64">One way or t'other , what he wants to gain ;</l>
     <l n="65">And this will show the observation just</l>
     <l n="66">The maxim 's such as you may always trust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="67">A FEMALE relative young Cleon had ,</l>
     <l n="68">A peevish prude , who looked upon the lad ,</l>
     <l n="69">As one she had a right to rule and scold ;</l>
     <l n="70">Her name was Mistress Alice : sour and old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="71">ONE summer 's day , Aminta to her said :</l>
     <l n="72">I cannot think how ‘ tis , your cousin 's led ,</l>
     <l n="73">( Though quite indifferent he is to me ,</l>
     <l n="74">And doubtless such will ever prove to be )</l>
     <l n="75">With various fond attentions , to pretend ,</l>
     <l n="76">He loves me — much beyond a common friend .</l>
     <l n="77">My window oft he passes day and night ;</l>
     <l n="78">I cannot move a step , but he 's in sight ,</l>
     <l n="79">And in a moment at my heels appears ;</l>
     <l n="80">Notes , letters full of soft expressions , dears ,</l>
     <l n="81">To me are sent by one I will not name ,</l>
     <l n="82">For known to you , she would be thought to blame :</l>
     <l n="83">Pray put an end to such a wild pursuit</l>
     <l n="84">It nothing can produce but wretched fruit ;</l>
     <l n="85">My husband may take fire at things like these ;</l>
     <l n="86">And as to Cleon .— me he 'll never please ;</l>
     <l n="87">I 'll thank you to inform him what I say ;</l>
     <l n="88">Such steps are useless : folly they betray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="89">MUCH praise Aminta from the dame received ;</l>
     <l n="90">Who promised that the conduct , which aggrieved ;</l>
     <l n="91">To Cleon she would mention , as desired ,</l>
     <l n="92">And reprimand him , as the fault required :</l>
     <l n="93">So well would scold him , that she might be sure ,</l>
     <l n="94">From him in future she would be secure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="95">THE foll'wing day our youth to Alice came ;</l>
     <l n="96">To pay a visit solely was his aim ;</l>
     <l n="97">She told him what Aminta had declared ,</l>
     <l n="98">And , in her lecture , words by no means spared .</l>
     <l n="99">The lad , surprised , on oath the whole denied ,</l>
     <l n="100">And vowed to gain her love , he never tried .</l>
     <l n="101">Old Alice called her cousin , imp of Hell ;</l>
     <l n="102">Said she , in all that 's wicked , you excel ;</l>
     <l n="103">You will not all your base designs confess ;</l>
     <l n="104">The oaths are false on which you lay such stress ,</l>
     <l n="105">And punishment most richly you deserve ;</l>
     <l n="106">But false or true , from this I will not swerve ,</l>

     <l n="113">THREE days had scarcely passed : Aminta came ,</l>

     <l n="123">Unless an iron tongue I could obtain :</l>
     <l n="124">All Hell was ransacked epithets to gain ;</l>
     <l n="125">And Lucifer and Beelzebub were used :</l>

     <l n="127">QUITE terrified , poor lad , he scarcely knew ;</l>

     <l n="134">To play some cunning trick , which , not disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="135">Would operate to bring her wish about ;</l>
     <l n="136">I see , said he , the scheme I should not doubt ;</l>

     <l n="140">I love her too , for beauty that secures ;</l>
     <l n="141">And while her seraph charms my bosom fire ;</l>
     <l n="142">I equally the stratagem admire .</l>
     <l n="143">Most freely howsoe'er I will confess ,</l>
     <l n="144">At first I was so dull , I could not guess</l>
     <l n="145">At what she aimed , but now the object 's plain :</l>
