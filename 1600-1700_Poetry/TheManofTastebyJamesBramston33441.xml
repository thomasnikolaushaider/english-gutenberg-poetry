  <body>
   <p>The idea of “ taste ” and the ideal of the “ man of taste ” have fallen considerably in critical esteem since the eighteenth century . When F. R. Leavis calls Andrew Lang “ a scholar and a man of taste , with a feeling for language and a desire to write poetry ,"[ 1 ] it is clear that for Leavis these attributes disqualify Lang from being taken seriously as a poet . But for the age of Pope , “ taste ” was a key term in its aesthetic thinking ; the meaning and application of the term was a lively issue which engaged most of the ablest minds of the period .</p>
   <p>Addison prefaced his series of Spectator papers on the “ Pleasures of the Imagination ” with a ground-clearing essay on “ taste ” ( No . 409 ) . In this classic account of the term , Addison defines “ taste ” as “ that Faculty of the Soul , which discerns the Beauties of an Author with Pleasure , and the Imperfections with Dislike . ” Addison 's “ taste ” is an innate proclivity towards certain kinds of aesthetic experience that has been consciously cultivated in the approved direction . It is not enough to value and enjoy the right authors ; they must be valued and enjoyed for the right reasons . When he holds up to ridicule the man who assured him that “ the greatest Pleasure he took in reading Virgil , was in examining Aeneas his Voyage by the Map , ” Addison clearly expects his readers to agree that such a singular taste was in fact no taste at all . His account implies not only a standard of “ taste , ” but also general agreement , at least among “ men of taste , ” about what the standard was . It is this circularity that makes it essential to assume some innate faculty of “ taste . ”</p>
   <p>But Addison 's prescription for the cultivation of taste was a laborious one , involving prolonged reading and study . The wealthy , and especially the newly wealthy , were tempted to confuse the correct appreciation of the objects of taste with the mere possession of them ; so that , as with Pope 's Timon in the Epistle to Burlington ( 1731 ) , owning a library became a substitute for reading books . This false taste for ostentation — especially in buildings — is a frequent target of contemporary satire .</p>
   <p>The social importance of “ taste ” as an index of wealth was reinforced by current philosophical thinking that gave “ taste ” a moral dimension too . In his Characteristicks ( 1711 ) , Shaftesbury postulated an innate moral sense , just as Addison did an innate aesthetic sense . Shaftesbury draws this analogy between the moral and the aesthetic :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The Case is the same here [ in the mental or moral Subjects ] , as in</l>
     <l n="2">the ordinary Bodys , or common Subjects of Sense . The Shapes ,</l>
     <l n="3">Motions , Colours , and Proportions of these being presented to our</l>
     <l n="4">Eye ; there necessarily results a Beauty or Deformity , according to</l>
     <l n="5">the different Measure , Arrangement and Disposition of their several</l>
     <l n="6">Parts . So in Behaviour and Actions , when presented to our</l>
     <l n="7">Understanding , there must be found , of necessity , an apparent</l>
     <l n="8">Difference , according to the Regularity or Irregularity of the</l>
     <l n="9">Subjects .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>The correct training of this capacity would enable men to make the right choices in both moral and aesthetic matters . This analogy is also the basis of Francis Hutcheson 's Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections ( 1728 ) .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">It is against the philosophical background of the writings of Addison ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shaftesbury , and Hutcheson that the satire on “ taste ” of Pope ,</l>
     <l n="3">Bramston , and others must be seen . But by the time Pope wrote his</l>
     <l n="4">Epistle to Burlington , Addison 's “ Faculty of the Soul ” had been</l>
     <l n="5">somewhat debased as a critical term , and the decline of “ taste ” was a</l>
     <l n="6">common topic . “ Nothing is so common as the affectation of , nor any</l>
     <l n="7">thing so seldom found as Taste ” was the complaint of the Weekly</l>
     <l n="8">Register in 1731 , deploring “ the degeneracy of Taste since Mr .</l>
     <l n="9">Addison 's time . "[ 3 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The publication of Pope 's Epistle to Burlington in December 1731 was a literary event of some importance , especially since it was his first poem since the Dunciad Variorum of 1729 . The Epistle gave “ taste ” a renewed currency as a vogue word . “ Of Taste ” is found only on the half-title of the first edition . But , significantly changed to “ Of False Taste ” for the second edition , this designation found its way onto the title-page of the third edition , and became the poem 's popular title ( it is so described on the advertisement leaf of Bramston 's The Man of Taste ) .</p>
   <p>Several attacks on Pope and his poem were published in the following year or so . A Miscellany on Taste ( 1732 ) reprinted Pope 's Epistle with combative critical notes . Pope himself was attacked , as “ Mr. Alexander Taste , ” in an anonymous pamphlet Mr . Taste the Poetical Fop ( 1732 ) , reissued in 1733 as The Man of Taste , apparently borrowing the title of Bramston 's poem .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Bramston 's The Man of Taste ( 1733 ) is an early example of the more positive reaction to Pope 's Epistle , joining him rather than attempting to beat him . Bramston 's poem in its turn occasioned an anonymous The Woman of Taste ( 1733 ) , and suggested some details for the character of Lord Apemode in James Miller 's comedy The Man of Taste ( 1735 ) . Pope himself borrowed an idea from it ( see p. 14 , 11 . 5-6 ) for a passage in the Dunciad ( the allusion to Free-Masons and F. R. S . ; IV , 567-71 ) .</p>
   <p>The cluster of works provoked by Pope 's Epistle is evidence of the topicality of “ taste ” at the time Bramston wrote his poem , and it is his Man of Taste that retains most interest today . The later history of “ taste ” in eighteenth-century aesthetics and satire can only briefly be glanced at here . Important philosophical discussions are Hume 's essay “ Of the Standard of Taste ” ( in Four Dissertations , 1757 ) , Burke 's Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful ( 1757 ; a “ Discourse Concerning Taste ” was prefaced to the second edition , 1759 ) , and Alexander Gerard 's Essay on Taste ( 1759 ) . Foote 's farce Taste ( 1752 ) exposed the sham taste for the antique . There are numerous satiric portraits of the “ Man of Taste ": Mr. Sterling in The Clandestine Marriage ( 1766 ) is a good example clearly in the tradition of Pope 's Timon , as is General Tilney in Northanger Abbey ( 1818 , but written much earlier ) .</p>
   <p>By the time of Jane Austen , of course , “ taste ” had developed away from the Addisonian rules , and indeed the whole tenor of the aesthetics of the imagination had changed . What had happened can be suggested by juxtaposing two significant statements about “ taste ” as metaphor . In his Spectator essay ( No . 409 ) Addison speaks of “ a very great Conformity between that Mental Taste , which is the Subject of this Paper , and that Sensitive Taste which gives us a Relish of every different Flavour that affects the Palate . ” But in the Preface to Lyrical Ballads ( 1802 ) , Wordsworth deprecates those “ who will converse with us as gravely about a taste for Poetry , as they express it , as if it were a thing indifferent as a taste for Rope-dancing , or Frontiniac or Sherry . "[ 5 ] But the breakdown of the metaphor of “ taste ” is too large a subject to be explored here .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Bramston also wrote Latin verses , and at least two unpublished poems survive ; but his reputation rests on The Art of Politicks and The Man of Taste . Both poems are of interest to the political and cultural historian , but from a literary point of view The Man of Taste is probably the better poem . This is largely because of Bramston 's success in creating the persona of a self-consciously affected Man of Taste , who , however , exposes himself more than he intends . Joseph Warton mistook this effect for a failure of technique when he called Bramston “ guilty of the indecorum and absurdity of making his hero laugh at himself and his own follies . "[ 7 ] The poem is deliberately the “ confessions ” of a self-styled Man of Taste . It begins in a casual , cynical tone , but as the speaker is gradually seduced by his own rhetoric ( especially when he imagines himself a nobleman ) he strikes an almost rhapsodic note , so that he is revealed as the victim , not the exploiter , of “ taste . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Both in his targets and his techniques , Bramston is a disciple of Pope .</l>
     <l n="2">Sometimes there is a conscious recollection of the master :</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="6">To murder mortar , and disfigure stones ! ( p. 10 )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Here the stylistic habit of antithesis works against the meaning instead of reinforcing it . But there are many good things in the poem ; Bramston 's treatment of the idea of the stage as a “ school of morality , ” for example , is clever and amusing . His hero derives his “ Hereditary Taste ” from being “ tragi-comically got ” by a player-poet and an orange-woman ( p. 6 ) . This gives point to his later claim :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">There are also a number of verbal successes , such as :</l>

     <l n="11">shows considerable appreciation of the Art of Sinking ; the second line</l>
     <l n="12">especially is fine bathos .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The poem as a whole provides an interesting portrait of contemporary fashionable “ taste ” that supplements , at a lower social level , Pope 's portraits of such magnates of tastelessness as Timon . Bramston 's Man of Taste is an odd amalgam of the singular and the trite . He begins by professing to despise laws , and ends by attempting to enact his own . In drawing a character whose tastes are at one moment shamelessly perverse , at another servilely imitative , and in depicting a wide range of “ tastes , ” Bramston has developed significantly the idea that he took from the Epistle to Burlington , which is largely concerned with false taste in building .</p>
   <p>This is not to deny that most of the victims of Bramston 's satire are somewhere Pope 's too . At times one even begins to suspect that Bramston 's knowledge of London derives as much from the Dunciad Variorum as from first-hand experience of the city . There is certainly a strong traditional element in some of his themes . The ironic praise of Sir Cloudesley Shovell 's tomb , for example ( p. 12 ) , was probably suggested by the Spectator ( No . 26 ) rather than a visit to Westminster Abbey ; the tomb had offended Addison because it portrayed the admiral in an alien character .</p>
   <p>But the traditional is combined with the topical . If Sir Cloudesley 's tomb had been a butt for twenty years , Sir Balaam is an allusion to Pope 's Epistle to Bathurst , only published in February , 1733 , the month before the Man of Taste . Further evidence that Bramston was making additions to the poem as late as February 1733 ( the poem was published on 8 March ) are the lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Not so my mind , unsatisfied with hints ,</l>
     <l n="2">Knows more than Budgel writes , or Roberts prints . ( p. 10 )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>These lines hit at a new readers ’ digest , The Bee : or , Universal Weekly Pamphlet . Containing Something to Hit Every Man 's Taste and Principles , which was edited by Budgell and published by Roberts . The first number came out in February 1733 . There is a similar mixture of past and current with the musical satire ( p. 13 ) . Handel 's Esther and the novelty of oratorio were as recent as 1732 ; Heidegger 's ugliness ( “ Prince Phyz ! ” ) was proverbial , and his renaming of the masquerade a decade old .</p>
   <p>This mixture is confusing , but certainly intentional , since it would have made the Man of Taste more ridiculous to a contemporary audience . There is also a vertical mixture of the tastes of different levels of society ; the writer in the Weekly Register for February 1731 , already quoted above , makes this distinction : “ The gaming-table , and the royal diversion at Newmarket , are the ambition of the majority ; and the rest prefer Senesino to Shakespear , as the highest proof of modern politeness . "[ 8 ] Bramston 's Man of Taste is a concertina-brow , enjoying Senesino , gaming , and Newmarket ( pp . 13 , 15 , 17 ) .</p>
   <p>The usefulness of notes for a full understanding of Bramston 's satire was recognized as early as 1733 , when a few were added to Faulkner 's Dublin reprint . Faulkner 's notes are remarkable for their xenophobic bias , for apart from those on Mrs. Oldfield ( “ Ophelia , ” p. 9 ) , they mostly call attention to evils of continental origin : Pasaran 's recommendation of suicide ( p. 9 ) ; Heidegger 's role as corrupting entertainer ( p. 13 ) ; the imposter Count D'Ughi ( the “ Di'mond Count , ” p. 16 ) ; and Misaubin ( p. 17 ) , “ famous for curing the venereal Disorders . ” These men were Italian , Swiss , Italian , and French respectively . This xenophobia is a remarkably constant feature of eighteenth-century satire on “ taste . ”</p>
   <p>The Man of Taste ( together with The Art of Politicks ) was included in Dodsley 's Collection ; in the 1782 edition , notes ( unsigned , but by Isaac Reed ) were added , identifying many allusions which no longer passed current . These are often helpful , but sometimes miss the point — as they do with the Budgell-Roberts joke , discussed above . But although notes are useful for a complete understanding of all Bramston 's satiric points , a familiarity with the world of Pope and his victims removes most of the difficulties for a modern reader . Only occasionally does Bramston sound a more personal note , as in the list of doctors ( p. 17 ) , where he includes two of his contemporaries at Christ Church ; and even here , Arbuthnot is a sufficient signpost .</p>
   <p>Bramston is a minor poet , but there is no need to apologize for The Man of Taste . It is a lively and amusing poem in its own right , and its association with Pope and its place in the corpus of eighteenth-century satire on “ taste ” raise its claim to the attention of students of the period .</p>

   <p>The Man of Taste was published on 8 March 1733 by Lawton Gilliver in a handsome folio format . A second folio edition ( although not so called ) was published later in the same month ; this was followed within the year by octavo editions in London<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and Dublin .</p>
   <p>Using the evidence of advertisements in the two folios and contemporary newspapers , W. B. Todd argues for the priority of the edition he calls “ A ,"[ 2 ] reversing the order previously suggested by Iolo A. Williams on internal evidence .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The textual variants are slight and are confined to accidentals , except that on p. 5 , line 9 , “ A ” reads “ Strife still persists ” and “ B ” has “ Strife still subsists . ” A copy of Todd 's edition “ A ” is reproduced here .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Although the imprint on the title page reads “ London , ” this edition was probably printed in Edinburgh .

     <l n="6">The Man of Taste .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="7">Whoe'er he be that to a Taste aspires ,</l>
     <l n="8">Let him read this , and be what he desires .</l>
     <l n="9">In men and manners vers 'd from life I write ,</l>
     <l n="10">Not what was once but what is now polite .</l>
     <l n="11">Those who of courtly France have made the tour ,</l>
     <l n="12">Can scarce our English awkwardness endure .</l>
     <l n="13">But honest men who never were abroad ,</l>
     <l n="14">Like England only , and its Taste applaud .</l>
     <l n="15">Strife still persists , which yields the better gout ;</l>
     <l n="16">Books or the world , the many or the few .</l>
     <l n="17">True Taste to me is by this touchstone known ,</l>
     <l n="18">That 's always best that 's nearest to my own .</l>
     <l n="19">To shew that my pretensions are not vain ,</l>
     <l n="20">My Father was a play'r in Drury-lane .</l>
     <l n="21">Pears and Pistachio-nuts my Mother sold ,</l>
     <l n="22">He a Dramatick-poet , She a Scold .</l>
     <l n="23">His tragick muse could Countesses affright ,</l>
     <l n="24">Her wit in boxes was my Lord 's delight .</l>
     <l n="25">No mercenary Priest e'er join 'd their hands ,</l>
     <l n="26">Uncramp 'd by wedlock 's unpoetick bands .</l>
     <l n="27">Laws my Pindarick parents matter 'd not ,</l>
     <l n="28">So I was tragi-comically got .</l>
     <l n="29">My infant tears a sort of measure kept ,</l>
     <l n="30">I squal 'd in Distichs , and in Triplets wept .</l>
     <l n="31">No youth did in I education waste ,</l>
     <l n="32">Happy in an Hereditary Taste .</l>
     <l n="33">Writing ne'er cramp 'd the sinews of my thumb ,</l>
     <l n="34">Nor barb'rous birch e'er brush 'd my brawny bum .</l>
     <l n="35">My guts ne'er suffer 'd from a college-cook ,</l>
     <l n="36">My name ne'er enter 'd in a buttery-book .</l>
     <l n="37">Grammar in vain the sons of Priscian teach ,</l>
     <l n="38">Good Parts are better than Eight Parts of Speech :</l>
     <l n="39">Since these declin 'd those undeclin 'd they call ,</l>
     <l n="40">I thank my Stars , that I declin 'd ‘ em all .</l>
     <l n="41">To Greek or Latin Tongues without pretence ,</l>
     <l n="42">I trust to mother Wit , and father Sense .</l>
     <l n="43">Nature 's my guide , all Sciences I scorn ,</l>
     <l n="44">Pains I abhor , I was a Poet born .</l>
     <l n="45">Yet is my gout for criticism such ,</l>
     <l n="46">I 've got some French , and know a little Dutch .</l>
     <l n="47">Huge commentators grace my learned shelves ,</l>
     <l n="48">Notes upon books out-do the books themselves .</l>
     <l n="49">Criticks indeed are valuable men ,</l>
     <l n="50">But hyper-criticks are as good agen .</l>
     <l n="51">Tho ’ Blackmore 's works my soul with raptures fill ,</l>
     <l n="52">With notes by Bently they 'd be better still .</l>
     <l n="53">The Boghouse-Miscellany 's well design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="54">To ease the body , and improve the mind .</l>
     <l n="55">Swift 's whims and jokes for my resentment call ,</l>
     <l n="56">For he displeases me , that pleases all .</l>
     <l n="57">Verse without rhyme I never could endure ,</l>
     <l n="58">Uncouth in numbers , and in sense obscure .</l>
     <l n="59">To him as Nature , when he ceas 'd to see ,</l>
     <l n="60">Milton 's an universal Blank to me .</l>
     <l n="61">Confirm 'd and settled by the Nations voice ,</l>
     <l n="62">Rhyme is the poet 's pride , and peoples choice .</l>
     <l n="63">Always upheld by national Support ,</l>
     <l n="64">Of Market , University , and Court :</l>
     <l n="65">Thompson , write blank ; but know that for that reason ,</l>
     <l n="66">These lines shall live , when thine are out of season .</l>
     <l n="67">Rhyme binds and beautifies the Poet 's lays ,</l>
     <l n="68">As London Ladies owe their shape to stays .</l>
     <l n="69">Had Cibber 's self the Careless Husband wrote ,</l>
     <l n="70">He for the Laurel ne'er had had my Vote :</l>
     <l n="71">But for his Epilogues and other Plays ,</l>
     <l n="72">He thoroughly deserves the Modern Bays .</l>
     <l n="73">It pleases me , that Pope unlaurell 'd goes ,</l>
     <l n="74">While Cibber wears the Bays for Playhouse Prose .</l>
     <l n="75">So Britain 's Monarch once uncover 'd fate ,</l>
     <l n="76">While Bradshaw bully 'd in a broad-brimm 'd hat .</l>
     <l n="77">Long live old Curl ! he ne'er to publish fears ,</l>
     <l n="78">The speeches , verses , and last wills of Peers .</l>
     <l n="79">How oft has he a publick spirit shewn ,</l>
     <l n="80">And pleas 'd our ears regardless of his own ?</l>
     <l n="81">But to give Merit due , though Curl 's the same ?</l>
     <l n="82">Are not his Brother-booksellers the same ?</l>
     <l n="83">Can Statutes keep the British Press in awe ,</l>
     <l n="84">While that sells best , that 's most against the Law ?</l>
     <l n="85">Lives of dead Play'rs my leisure hours beguile ,</l>
     <l n="86">And Sessions-Papers tragedize my stile .</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Tis charming reading in Ophelia 's life ,</l>
     <l n="88">So oft a Mother , and not once a Wife :</l>
     <l n="89">She could with just propriety behave ,</l>
     <l n="90">Alive with Peers , with Monarchs in her grave :</l>
     <l n="91">Her lot how oft have envious harlots wept ,</l>
     <l n="92">By Prebends bury 'd and by Generals kept .</l>
     <l n="93">T'improve in Morals Mandevil I read ,</l>
     <l n="94">And Tyndal 's Scruples are my settled Creed .</l>
     <l n="95">I travell 'd early , and I soon saw through</l>
     <l n="96">Religion all , e'er I was twenty-two .</l>
     <l n="97">Shame , Pain , or Poverty shall I endure ,</l>
     <l n="98">When ropes or opium can my ease procure ?</l>
     <l n="99">When money 's gone , and I no debts can pay ,</l>
     <l n="100">Self-murder is an honourable way .</l>
     <l n="101">As Pasaran directs I 'd end my life ,</l>
     <l n="102">And kill myself , my daughter , and my wife .</l>
     <l n="103">Burn but that Bible which the Parson quotes ,</l>
     <l n="104">And men of spirit all shall cut their throats .</l>
     <l n="105">But not to writings I confine my pen ,</l>
     <l n="106">I have a taste for buildings , musick , men .</l>
     <l n="107">Young travell 'd coxcombs mighty knowledge boast ,</l>
     <l n="108">With superficial Smatterings at Most .</l>
     <l n="109">Not so my mind , unsatisfied with hints ,</l>
     <l n="110">Knows more than Budgel writes , or Roberts prints .</l>
     <l n="111">I know the town , all houses I have seen ,</l>
     <l n="112">From High-Park corner down to Bednal-Green .</l>
     <l n="113">Sure wretched Wren was taught by bungling Jones ,</l>
     <l n="114">To murder mortar , and disfigure stones !</l>
     <l n="115">Who in Whitehall can symmetry discern ?</l>
     <l n="116">I reckon Convent-garden Church a Barn .</l>
     <l n="117">Nor hate I less thy vile Cathedral , Paul !</l>
     <l n="118">The choir 's too big , the cupola 's too small :</l>
     <l n="119">Substantial walls and heavy roofs I like ,</l>
     <l n="120">‘ Tis Vanbrug 's structures that my fancy strike :</l>
     <l n="121">Such noble ruins ev'ry pile wou 'd make ,</l>
     <l n="122">I wish they 'd tumble for the prospect 's sake .</l>
     <l n="123">To lofty Chelsea or to Greenwich Dome ,</l>
     <l n="124">Soldiers and sailors all are welcom 'd home .</l>
     <l n="125">Her poor to palaces Britannia brings ,</l>
     <l n="126">St. James 's hospital may serve for kings .</l>
     <l n="127">Building so happily I understand ,</l>
     <l n="128">That for one house I 'd mortgage all my land .</l>
     <l n="129">Dorick , Ionick , shall not there be found ,</l>
     <l n="130">But it shall cost me threescore thousand pound .</l>
     <l n="131">From out my honest workmen , I 'll select</l>
     <l n="132">A Bricklay'r , and proclaim him architect ;</l>
     <l n="133">First bid him build me a stupendous Dome ,</l>
     <l n="134">Which having finish 'd , we set out for Rome ;</l>
     <l n="135">Take a weeks view of Venice and the Brent ,</l>
     <l n="136">Stare round , see nothing , and come home content .</l>
     <l n="137">I 'll have my Villa too , a sweet abode ,</l>
     <l n="138">Its situation shall be London road :</l>
     <l n="139">Pots o'er the door I 'll place like Cits balconies ,</l>
     <l n="140">Which<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Bently calls the Gardens of Adonis .</l>
     <l n="141">I 'll have my Gardens in the fashion too ,</l>
     <l n="142">For what is beautiful that is not new ?</l>
     <l n="143">Fair four-legg 'd temples , theatres that vye ,</l>
     <l n="144">With all the angles of a Christmas-pye .</l>
     <l n="145">Does it not merit the beholder 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="146">What 's high to sink ? and what is low to raise ?</l>
     <l n="147">Slopes shall ascend where once a green-house stood ,</l>
     <l n="148">And in my horse-pond I will plant a wood .</l>
     <l n="149">Let misers dread the hoarded gold to waste ,</l>
     <l n="150">Expence and alteration shew a Taste .</l>
     <l n="151">In curious paintings I 'm exceeding nice ,</l>
     <l n="152">And know their several beauties by their Price .</l>
     <l n="153">Auctions and Sales I constantly attend ,</l>
     <l n="154">But chuse my pictures by a skilful friend .</l>
     <l n="155">Originals and copies much the same ,</l>
     <l n="156">The picture 's value is the painter 's name .</l>
     <l n="157">My taste in Sculpture from my choice is seen ,</l>
     <l n="158">I buy no statues that are not obscene .</l>
     <l n="159">In spite of Addison and ancient Rome ,</l>
     <l n="160">Sir Cloudesly Shovel 's is my fav'rite tomb .</l>
     <l n="161">How oft have I with admiration stood ,</l>
     <l n="162">To view some City-magistrate in wood ?</l>
     <l n="163">I gaze with pleasure on a Lord May'r ' s head ,</l>
     <l n="164">Cast with propriety in gilded lead .</l>
     <l n="165">Oh could I view through London as I pass ,</l>
     <l n="166">Some broad Sir Balaam in Corinthian brass ;</l>
     <l n="167">High on a pedestal , ye Freemen , place</l>
     <l n="168">His magisterial Paunch and griping Face ;</l>
     <l n="169">Letter 'd and Gilt , let him adorn Cheapside ,</l>
     <l n="170">And grant the Tradesman , what a King 's deny 'd .</l>
     <l n="171">Old Coins and Medals I collect , ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="172">Sir Andrew has ‘ em , and I 'll have ‘ em too .</l>
     <l n="173">But among friends if I the truth might speak ,</l>
     <l n="174">I like the modern , and despise th ’ antique .</l>
     <l n="175">Tho ’ in the draw'rs of my japan Bureau ,</l>
     <l n="176">To Lady Gripeall I the Caesars shew ,</l>
     <l n="177">‘ Tis equal to her Ladyship or me ,</l>
     <l n="178">A copper Otho , or a Scotch Baubee .</l>
     <l n="179">Without Italian , or without an ear ,</l>
     <l n="180">To Bononcini 's musick I adhere :</l>
     <l n="181">Musick has charms to sooth a savage beast ,</l>
     <l n="182">And therefore proper at a Sheriff 's feast .</l>
     <l n="183">My soul has oft a secret pleasure found ,</l>
     <l n="184">In the harmonious Bagpipe 's lofty sound .</l>
     <l n="185">Bagpipes for men , shrill German-flutes for boys ,</l>
     <l n="186">I 'm English born , and love a grumbling noise .</l>
     <l n="187">The Stage should yield the solemn Organ 's note ,</l>
     <l n="188">And Scripture tremble in the Eunuch 's throat .</l>
     <l n="189">Let Senesino sing , what David writ ,</l>
     <l n="190">And Hallelujahs charm the pious pit .</l>
     <l n="191">Eager in throngs the town to Hester came ,</l>
     <l n="192">And Oratorio was a lucky name .</l>
     <l n="193">Thou , Heeideggre ! the English taste has found ,</l>
     <l n="194">And rul'st the mob of quality with sound .</l>
     <l n="195">In Lent , if Masquerades displease the town ,</l>
     <l n="196">Call ‘ em Ridotto 's , and they still go down :</l>
     <l n="197">Go on , Prince Phyz ! to please the British nation ,</l>
     <l n="198">Call thy next Masquerade a Convocation .</l>
     <l n="199">Bears , Lyons , Wolves , and Elephants I breed ,</l>
     <l n="200">And Philosophical Transactions read .</l>
     <l n="201">Next Lodge I 'll be Free-Mason , nothing less ,</l>
     <l n="202">Unless I happen to be F. R. S .</l>
     <l n="203">I have a Palate , and ( as yet ) two Ears ,</l>
     <l n="204">Fit company for Porters , or for Peers .</l>
     <l n="205">Of ev'ry useful knowledge I 've a share ,</l>
     <l n="206">But my top talent is a bill of fare .</l>
     <l n="207">Sir Loins and rumps of beef offend my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="208">Pleas 'd with frogs fricasseed , and coxcomb-pies .</l>
     <l n="209">Dishes I chuse though little , yet genteel ,</l>
     <l n="210">Snails the first course , and Peepers crown the meal .</l>
     <l n="211">Pigs heads with hair on , much my fancy please ,</l>
     <l n="212">I love young colly-flow'rs if stew 'd in cheese ,</l>
     <l n="213">And give ten guineas for a pint of peas .</l>
     <l n="214">No tatling servants to my table come ,</l>
     <l n="215">My Grace is Silence , and my waiter Dumb .</l>
     <l n="216">Queer Country-puts extol Queen Bess 's reign ,</l>
     <l n="217">And of lost hospitality complain .</l>
     <l n="218">Say thou that do'st thy father 's table praise ,</l>
     <l n="219">Was there Mahogena in former days ?</l>
     <l n="220">Oh ! could a British Barony be sold !</l>
     <l n="221">I would bright honour buy with dazling gold .</l>
     <l n="222">Could I the privilege of Peer procure ,</l>
     <l n="223">The rich I 'd bully , and oppress the poor .</l>
     <l n="224">To give is wrong , but it is wronger still ,</l>
     <l n="225">On any terms to pay a tradesman 's bill .</l>
     <l n="226">I 'd make the insolent Mechanicks stay ,</l>
     <l n="227">And keep my ready money all for play .</l>
     <l n="228">I 'd try if any pleasure could be found ,</l>
     <l n="229">In tossing-up for twenty thousand pound .</l>
     <l n="230">Had I whole Counties , I to White 's would go ,</l>
     <l n="231">And set lands , woods , and rivers , at a throw .</l>
     <l n="232">But should I meet with an unlucky run ,</l>
     <l n="233">And at a throw be gloriously undone ;</l>
     <l n="234">My debts of honour I 'd discharge the first ,</l>
     <l n="235">Let all my lawful creditors be curst :</l>
     <l n="236">My Title would preserve me from arrest ,</l>
     <l n="237">And seising hired horses is a jest .</l>
     <l n="238">I 'd walk the mornings with an oaken stick ,</l>
     <l n="239">With gloves and hat , like my own footman , Dick .</l>
     <l n="240">A footman I wou 'd be , in outward show ,</l>
     <l n="241">In sense , and education , truly so .</l>
     <l n="242">As for my head , it should ambiguous wear</l>
     <l n="243">At once a periwig , and its own hair .</l>
     <l n="244">My hair I 'd powder in the women 's way ,</l>
     <l n="245">And dress , and talk of dressing , more than they .</l>
     <l n="246">I 'll please the maids of honour , if I can ;</l>
     <l n="247">Without black-velvet-britches , what is man ?</l>
     <l n="248">I will my skill in button-holes display ,</l>
     <l n="249">And brag how oft I shift me ev'ry day .</l>
     <l n="250">Shall I wear cloaths , in awkward England made ?</l>
     <l n="251">And sweat in cloth , to help the woollen trade ?</l>
     <l n="252">In French embroid'ry and in Flanders lace</l>
     <l n="253">I 'll spend the income of a treasurer 's place .</l>
     <l n="254">Deard 's bill for baubles shall to thousands mount ,</l>
     <l n="255">And I 'd out-di'mond ev'n the Di'mond Count .</l>
     <l n="256">I would convince the world by taudry cloa 's ,</l>
     <l n="257">That Belles are less effeminate than beaux ,</l>
     <l n="258">And Doctor Lamb should pare my Lordship 's toes .</l>
     <l n="259">To boon companions I my time would give ,</l>
     <l n="260">With players , pimps , and parasites I 'd live .</l>
     <l n="261">I would with Jockeys from Newmarket dine ,</l>
     <l n="262">And to Rough-riders give my choicest wine .</l>
     <l n="263">I would caress some Stableman of note ,</l>
     <l n="264">And imitate his language , and his coat .</l>
     <l n="265">My ev'nings all I would with sharpers spend ,</l>
     <l n="266">And make the Thief-catcher my bosom friend .</l>
     <l n="267">In Fig the Prize-fighter by day delight ,</l>
     <l n="268">And sup with Colly Cibber ev'ry night .</l>
     <l n="269">Should I perchance be fashionably ill ,</l>
     <l n="270">I 'd send for Misaubin , and take his pill .</l>
     <l n="271">I should abhor , though in the utmost need ,</l>
     <l n="272">Arbuthnot , Hollins , Wigan , Lee , or Mead :</l>
     <l n="273">But if I found that I grew worse and worse ,</l>
     <l n="274">I 'd turn off Misaubin and take a Nurse .</l>
     <l n="275">How oft , when eminent physicians fail ,</l>
     <l n="276">Do good old womens remedies prevail ?</l>
     <l n="277">When beauty 's gone , and Chloe 's struck with years ,</l>
     <l n="278">Eyes she can couch , or she can syringe ears .</l>
     <l n="279">Of Graduates I dislike the learned rout ,</l>
     <l n="280">And chuse a female Doctor for the gout .</l>
     <l n="281">Thus would I live , with no dull pedants curs 'd ,</l>
     <l n="282">Sure , of all blockheads , Scholars are the worst .</l>
     <l n="283">Back to your Universitys , ye fools ,</l>
     <l n="284">And dangle Arguments on strings in schools :</l>
     <l n="285">Those schools which Universitys they call ,</l>
     <l n="286">‘ Twere well for England were there none at all .</l>
     <l n="287">With ease that loss the nation might sustain ,</l>

     <l n="289">Oxford and Cambridge are not worth one farthing ,</l>
     <l n="290">Compar 'd to Haymarket , and Convent-garden :</l>
