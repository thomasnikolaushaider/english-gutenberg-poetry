   <p>My Dear Young Friends ,</p>
   <p>Whom I am constrained to love and honour by many Obligations . It was the generous and condescending Friendship of your Parents under my weak Circumstances of Health , that brought me to their Country-Seat for the Benefit of the Air ; but it was an Instance of most uncommon Kindness , to supply me there so chearfully for two Years of Sickness with the richest Conveniences of Life . Such a Favour requires my most affectionate Returns of Service to themselves , and to all that is dear to them ; and meer Gratitude demands some solemn and publick Acknowledgment .</p>
   <p>But great Minds have the true Relish and Pleasure of doing Good , and are content to be unknown .</p>
   <p>It is such a silent Satisfaction Sir Thomas Abney enjoys in the unspeakable Blessings of this Year , that brought our present King to the Throne : and he permits the World to forget that happy Turn that was given to the Affairs of the Kingdom by his wise Management in the Highest Office of the City , whereby the Settlement of the Crown was so much strengthen 'd in the Illustrious Family which now possesses it . O may the Crown flourish many Years on the Head of our Soveraign , and may his House possess it to the End of Time , to secure all Religious and Civil Liberties to the Posterity of those who have been so zealous to establish this Succession !</p>
   <p>The fair and lovely Character your Honoured Father hath acquired by passing thro ’ all the chief Offices of the City , and leaving a Lustre upon them , seems imperfect in his own Esteem , without the Addition of this Title , A Succourer and a Friend of the Ministers of Christ . And in this part of his Honour the Lady your Mother is resolved to have an unborrow 'd Share , and becomes his daily Rival .</p>
   <p>It is to her unwearied Tenderness , and many kind Offices by Night and Day , in the more violent Seasons of my Indisposition , that ( under God ) I own my Life , and Power to write or think . And while I remember those Hours , I can n't forget the cheerful and ready Attendance of her worthy Sister , her dear Companion and Assistant in every good Work .</p>
   <p>Under the Influence of two such Examples I have also enjoy 'd the Pleasure and Conveniency of your younger Services , according to the Capacity of your Years ; and that with such a Degree of sincere and hearty Zeal for my Welfare , that you are ready to vie with each other in the kind Imployment , and assist all you can toward my Recovery and Usefulness . So that whoever shall reap benefit by any of my Labours , it is but a reasonable Request , that you share with me in their Thanks and their Prayers .</p>
   <p>But this is a small Part of your Praise .</p>
   <p>If it would not be suspected of Flattery , I could tell the World what an Acquaintance with Scripture , what a Knowledge of Religion , what a Memory of Divine things both in Verse and Prose is found among you ; and what a just and regular account is given of Sermons at your Age ; to awaken all the Children that shall read these Songs , to furnish their memories and beautify their Souls like yours . The Honour you have done me in learning by heart so large a number of the Hymns I have publish 'd , perhaps has been of some use towards these greater Improvements , and gives me rich Encouragement to offer you this little Present .</p>

     <l n="1">Since I have ventured to shew a Part of your early Character to the</l>
     <l n="2">World , I perswade my self you will remember , that it must inlarge</l>
     <l n="3">and brighten daily . Remember what the World will expect from the</l>

     <l n="5">such Examples , and after such fair and promising Blossoms of Piety</l>

     <l n="7">from whose Grace you have received plentiful Distributions in the</l>
     <l n="8">Beginning of your Days . May the Blessings of his Right Hand more</l>
     <l n="9">enrich you daily , as your Capacities and your Years increase ; and</l>
     <l n="10">may he add bountifully of the Favours of his Left Hand , Riches and</l>

      <l n="20">To all that are concerned in the Education of Children .</l>
     </lg>

      <l n="21">My Friends ,</l>

   <p>It is an awful and important charge that is committed to you . The wisdom and welfare of the succeeding generation are intrusted with you beforehand , and depend much on your conduct . The seeds of misery or happiness in this world , and that to come , are oftentimes sown very early , and therefore whatever may conduce to give the minds of children a relish for vertue and religion , ought in the first place to be proposed to you .</p>
   <p>Verse was at first design 'd for the service of God , tho ’ it hath been wretchedly abused since . The ancients among the Jews and the Heathens taught their children and disciples the precepts of morality and worship in verse . The children of Israel were commanded to learn the words of the song of Moses , Deut . 31 . 19 , 30 . And we are directed in the New Testament , not only to sing with grace in the heart , but to teach and admonish one another by hymns and songs , Eph . 5 . 19. and there are these four advantages in it :</p>
   <p>1 . There is a greater delight in the very learning of truths and duties this way . There is something so amusing and entertaining in rhymes and metre , that will incline children to make this part of their business a diversion . And you may turn their very duty into a reward , by giving them the privilege of learning one of these songs every week , if they fulfil the business of the week well , and promising them the book itself when they have learned ten or twenty songs out of it .</p>
   <p>2 . What is learnt in verse is longer retained in memory , and sooner recollected . The like sounds and the like number of syllables exceedingly assist the remembrance . And it may often happen , that the end of a song running in the mind may be an effectual means to keep off some temptation , or to incline to some duty , when a word of scripture is not upon the thoughts .</p>
   <p>3 . This will be a constant furniture for the minds of children , that they may have something to think upon when alone , and sing over to themselves . This may sometimes give their thoughts a divine turn , and raise a young meditation . Thus they will not be forced to seek relief for an emptiness of mind out of the loose and dangerous sonnets of the age .</p>
   <p>4 . These Divine Songs may be a pleasant and proper matter for their daily or weekly worship , to sing one in the family at such time as the parents or governors shall appoint ; and therefore I have confin 'd the verse to the most usual psalm tunes .</p>
   <p>The greatest part of this little book was composed several years ago , at the request of a friend , who has been long engaged in the work of catechising a very great number of children of all kinds , and with abundant skill and success . So that you will find here nothing that savours of a party : the children of high and low degree , of the Church of England or Dissenters , baptized in infancy or not , may all join together in these songs . And as I have endeavoured to sink the language to the level of a child 's understanding , and yet to keep it ( if possible ) above contempt ; so I have designed to profit all ( if possible ) and offend none . I hope the more general the sense is , these composures may be of the more universal use and service .</p>
   <p>I have added at the end an attempt or two of Sonnets on Moral Subjects for children , with an air of pleasantry , to provoke some fitter pen to write a little book of them . My talent doth not lie that way , and a man on the borders of the grave has other work . Besides , if I had health or leisure to lay out this way , it should be employ 'd in finishing the Psalms , which I have so long promised the world .</p>
   <p>May the Almighty God make you faithful in this important work of education : may he succeed your cares with his abundant graces , that the rising generation of Great Britain may be a glory amongst the nations , a pattern to the Christian world , and a blessing to the earth .</p>
