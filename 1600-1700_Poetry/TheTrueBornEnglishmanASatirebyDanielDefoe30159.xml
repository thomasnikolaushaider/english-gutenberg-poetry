    <docImprint>Ye heavens regard ! Almighty Jove , look down , And view thy injured monarch on the throne . On their ungrateful heads due vengeance take , Who sought his aid , and then his part forsake . If I have fallen rudely upon our vices , I hope none but the vicious will be angry . As for writing for interest , I disown it ; I have neither place , nor pension , nor prospect ; nor seek none , nor will have none : if matter of fact justifies the truth of the crimes , the Satire is just . As to the poetic liberties , I hope the crime is pardonable ; I am content to be stoned , provided none will attack me but the innocent . If my countrymen would take the hint , and grow better natured from my ill-natured poem as some call it ; I would say this of it , that though it is far from the best Satire that ever was wrote , it would do the most good that ever Satire did . And yet I am ready to ask pardon of some gentlemen too ; who though they are Englishmen , have good nature enough to see themselves reproved , and can hear it . These are gentlemen in a true sense , that can bare to be told of their faux pas , and not abuse the reprover . To such I must say , this is no Satire ; they are exceptions to the general rule ; and I value my performance from their generous approbation , more than I can from any opinion I have of its worth . The hasty errors of my verse I made my excuse for before ; and since the time I have been upon it has been but little , and my leisure less , I have all along strove rather to make the thoughts explicit , than the poem correct . However , I have mended some faults in this edition , and the rest must be placed to my account . As to answers , banters , true English Billingsgate , I expect them till nobody will buy , and then the shop will be shut . Had I wrote it for the gain of the press , I should have been concerned at its being printed again , and again , by pirates , as they call them , and paragraph-men ; but would they but do it justice , and print it true , according to the copy , they are welcome to sell it for a penny , if they please . The pence , indeed , is the end of their works . I will engage if nobody will buy , nobody will write : and not a patriot poet of them all , now will in defence of his native country , which I have abused , they say , print an answer to it , and give it about for God 's sake .</docImprint>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The end of satire is reformation : and the author , though he doubt the work of conversion is at a general stop , has put his hand in the plough . I expect a storm of ill language from the fury of the town . And especially from those whose English talent it is to rail : and , without being taken for a conjuror , I may venture to foretel , that I shall be cavilled at about my mean style , rough verse , and incorrect language , things I indeed might have taken more care in . But the book is printed ; and though I see some faults , it is too late to mend them . And this is all I think needful to say to them .</p>
    <p n="2">Possibly somebody may take me for a Dutchman ; in which they are mistaken : but I am one that would be glad to see Englishmen behave themselves better to strangers , and to governors also , that one might not be reproached in foreign countries for belonging to a nation that wants manners .</p>
    <p n="3">I assure you , gentlemen , strangers use us better abroad ; and we can give no reason but our ill-nature for the contrary here .</p>
    <p n="4">Methinks an Englishman who is so proud of being called a good fellow , should be civil . And it cannot be denied , but we are , in many cases , and particularly to strangers , the most churlish people alive .</p>
    <p n="5">As to vices , who can dispute our intemperance , while an honest drunken fellow is a character in a man 's praise ? All our reformations are banters , and will be so till our magistrates and gentry reform themselves , by way of example ; then , and not till then , they may be expected to punish others without blushing .</p>
    <p n="6">As to our ingratitude , I desire to be understood of that particular people , who pretending to be Protestants , have all along endeavoured to reduce the liberties and religion of this nation into the hands of King James and his Popish powers : together with such who enjoy the peace and protection of the present government , and yet abuse and affront the king who procured it , and openly profess their uneasiness under him : these , by whatsoever names or titles they are dignified or distinguished , are the people aimed at ; nor do I disown , but that it is so much the temper of an Englishman to abuse his benefactor , that I could be glad to see it rectified .</p>
    <p n="7">They who think I have been guilty of any error , in exposing the crimes of my own countrymen to themselves , may , among many honest instances of the like nature , find the same thing in Mr. Cowley , in his imitation of the second Olympic Ode of Pindar ; his words are these :—</p>
    <p n="8">But in this thankless world , the givers Are envied even by the receivers . ‘ Tis now the cheap and frugal fashion , Rather to hide than pay an obligation . Nay , ‘ tis much worse than so ; It now an artifice doth grow , Wrongs and outrages they do , Lest men should think we owe .</p>

    <head>THE INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Speak , Satire , for there 's none can tell like thee ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whether ‘ tis folly , pride , or knavery ,</l>
     <l n="3">That makes this discontented land appear</l>
     <l n="4">Less happy now in times of peace , than war :</l>
     <l n="5">Why civil feuds disturb the nation more ,</l>
     <l n="6">Than all our bloody wars have done before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place ,</l>
     <l n="8">And men are always honest in disgrace :</l>
     <l n="9">The court preferments make men knaves in course :</l>
     <l n="10">But they which wou 'd be in them wou 'd be worse .</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Tis not at foreigners that we repine ,</l>
     <l n="12">Wou 'd foreigners their perquisites resign :</l>
     <l n="13">The grand contention 's plainly to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="14">To get some men put out , and some put in .</l>
     <l n="15">For this our Senators make long harangues .</l>
     <l n="16">And florid Ministers whet their polish 'd tongues .</l>
     <l n="17">Statesmen are always sick of one disease ;</l>
     <l n="18">And a good pension gives them present ease .</l>
     <l n="19">That 's the specific makes them all content</l>
     <l n="20">With any King and any government .</l>
     <l n="21">Good patriots at court abuses rail ,</l>
     <l n="22">And all the nation 's grievances bewail :</l>
     <l n="23">But when the sov'reign balsam 's once apply 'd ,</l>
     <l n="24">The zealot never fails to change his side ;</l>
     <l n="25">And when he must the golden key resign ,</l>
     <l n="26">The railing spirit comes about again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">Who shall this bubbl 'd nation disabuse ,</l>
     <l n="28">While they their own felicities refuse ?</l>
     <l n="29">Who at the wars have made such mighty pother ,</l>
     <l n="30">And now are falling out with one another :</l>
     <l n="31">With needless fears the jealous nations fill ,</l>
     <l n="32">And always have been sav 'd against their will :</l>
     <l n="33">Who fifty millions sterling have disburs 'd</l>
     <l n="34">To be with peace , and too much plenty , curs 'd ;</l>
     <l n="35">Who their old monarch eagerly undo ,</l>
     <l n="36">And yet uneasily obey the new .</l>
     <l n="37">Search , Satire , search ; a deep incision make :</l>
     <l n="38">The poison 's strong , the antidote 's too weak .</l>
     <l n="39">‘ Tis pointed truth must manage this dispute ,</l>
     <l n="40">And down-right English , Englishmen confute .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="41">Whet thy just anger at the nation 's pride ;</l>
     <l n="42">And with keen phrase repel the vicious tide ,</l>
     <l n="43">To Englishmen their own beginnings show ,</l>
     <l n="44">And ask them , why they slight their neighbours so :</l>
     <l n="45">Go back to elder times , and ages past ,</l>
     <l n="46">And nations into long oblivion cast ;</l>
     <l n="47">To elder Britain 's youthful days retire ,</l>
     <l n="48">And there for true-born Englishmen inquire ,</l>
     <l n="49">Britannia freely will disown the name ,</l>
     <l n="50">And hardly knows herself from whence they came ;</l>
     <l n="51">Wonders that they of all men should pretend</l>
     <l n="52">To birth , and blood , and for a name contend .</l>
     <l n="53">Go back to causes where our follies dwell ,</l>
     <l n="54">And fetch the dark original from hell :</l>
     <l n="55">Speak , Satire , for there 's none like thee can tell .</l>

      <l n="21">Thro ’ all the world they spread his vast command ,</l>

      <l n="23">They rule so politicly and so well ,</l>
      <l n="24">As if they were Lords Justices of hell ;</l>

      <l n="27">Pride , the first peer , and president of hell ,</l>

    <head>THE CONCLUSION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then let us boast of ancestors no more ,</l>
     <l n="2">Or deeds of heroes done in days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="3">In latent records of the ages past ,</l>
     <l n="4">Behind the rear of time , in long oblivion plac 'd ;</l>
     <l n="5">For if our virtues must in lines descend ,</l>
     <l n="6">The merit with the families would end ,</l>
     <l n="7">And intermixtures would most fatal grow ;</l>
     <l n="8">For vice would be hereditary too ;</l>
     <l n="9">The tainted blood would of necessity ,</l>
     <l n="10">Involuntary wickedness convey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Vice , like ill-nature , for an age or two ,</l>
     <l n="12">May seem a generation to pursue ;</l>
     <l n="13">But virtue seldom does regard the breed ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fools do the wise , and wise men fools succeed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">What is't to us , what ancestors we had ?</l>
     <l n="16">If good , what better ? or what worse , if bad ?</l>
     <l n="17">Examples are for imitation set ,</l>
     <l n="18">Yet all men follow virtue with regret .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Could but our ancestors retrieve their fate ,</l>
     <l n="20">And see their offspring thus degenerate ;</l>
     <l n="21">How we contend for birth and names unknown ,</l>
     <l n="22">And build on their past actions , not our own ;</l>
     <l n="23">They 'd cancel records , and their tombs deface ,</l>
     <l n="24">And openly disown the vile degenerate race :</l>
     <l n="25">For fame of families is all a cheat ,</l>
     <l n="26">It 's personal virtue only makes us great .</l>
