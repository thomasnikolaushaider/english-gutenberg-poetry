   <p>Courteous Reader , there was no Argument at first intended to the Book , but for the satisfaction of many that have desired it , I have procur 'd it , and withall a reason of that which stumbled many others , why the Poem Rimes not . S. Simmons .</p>
   <p>Notes : The Printer to the Reader ] Added in 1668 to the copies then remaining of the first edition , amended in 1669 , and omitted in 1670 . I have procur 'd it , and .... not . 1669 ] is procured . 1668 .</p>
   <p>THE VERSE .</p>
   <p>THE measure is English Heroic Verse without Rime as that of Homer in Greek , and of Virgil in Latin ; Rime being no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse , in longer Works especially , but the Invention of a barbarous Age , to set off wretched matter and lame Meeter ; grac't indeed since by the use of some famous modern Poets , carried away by Custom , but much to thir own vexation , hindrance , and constraint to express many things otherwise , and for the most part worse then else they would have exprest them . Not without cause therefore some both Italian and Spanish Poets of prime note have rejected Rime both in longer and shorter Works , as have also long since our best English Tragedies , as a thing of it self , to all judicious eares , triveal and of no true musical delight : which consists only in apt Numbers , fit quantity of Syllables , and the sense variously drawn out from one Verse into another , not in the jingling sound of like endings , a fault avoyded by the learned Ancients both in Poetry and all good Oratory This neglect then of Rime so little is to be taken for a defect though it may seem so perhaps to vulgar Readers , that it rather is to be esteem 'd an example set , the first in English , of ancient liberty recover 'd to Heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing .</p>
   <p>Note : The Verse ] Added in 1668 to the copies then remaining of the first edition ; together with the Argument . In the second edition ( 1674 ) the Argument , with the necessary adjustment to the division made in Books vii and x , was distributed through the several books of the poem , as it is here printed .</p>

    <head>BOOK I .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>THIS first Book proposes first in brief the whole Subject , Mans disobedience , and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was plac't : Then touches the prime cause of his fall , the Serpent , or rather Satan in the Serpent ; who revolting from God , and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels , was by the command of God driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the great Deep . Which action past over , the Poem hasts into the midst of things , presenting Satan with his Angels now fallen into Hell describ 'd here , not in the Center ( for Heaven and Earth may be suppos 'd as yet not made , certainly not yet accurst ) but in a place of utter darknesse , fitliest call 'd Chaos : Here Satan with his Angels lying on the burning Lake , thunder-struck and astonisht , after a certain space recovers , as from confusion , calls up him who next in Order and Dignity lay by him ; they confer of thir miserable fall . Satan awakens all his Legions , who lay till then in the same manner confounded ; They rise , thir Numbers , array of Battel , thir chief Leaders nam 'd according to the Idols known afterwards in Canaan and the Countries adjoyning . To these Satan directs his Speech , comforts them with hope yet of gaining Heaven , but tells them lastly of a new World and new kind of Creature to be created , according to an ancient Prophesie or report in Heaven ; for that Angels were long before this visible Creation , was the opinion of many ancient Fathers . To find out the truth of this Prophesie , and what to determin thereon he refers to a full councell . What his Associates thence attempt . Pandemonium the palace of Satan rises , suddenly built out of the Deep : The infernal Peers there sit in Counsel .</head>
     <l n="1">Of Mans First Disobedience , and the Fruit</l>
     <l n="2">Of that Forbidden Tree , whose mortal tast</l>
     <l n="3">Brought Death into the World , and all our woe ,</l>
     <l n="4">With loss of Eden , till one greater Man</l>
     <l n="5">Restore us , and regain the blissful Seat ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sing Heav'nly Muse , that on the secret top</l>
     <l n="7">Of Oreb , or of Sinai , didst inspire</l>
     <l n="8">That Shepherd , who first taught the chosen Seed ,</l>
     <l n="9">In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth</l>
     <l n="10">Rose out of Chaos : Or if Sion Hill 10</l>
     <l n="11">Delight thee more , and Siloa 's Brook that flow 'd</l>
     <l n="12">Fast by the Oracle of God ; I thence</l>
     <l n="13">Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song ,</l>
     <l n="14">That with no middle flight intends to soar</l>
     <l n="15">Above th ’ Aonian Mount , while it pursues</l>
     <l n="16">Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime .</l>
     <l n="17">And chiefly Thou O Spirit , that dost prefer</l>
     <l n="18">Before all Temples th ’ upright heart and pure ,</l>
     <l n="19">Instruct me , for Thou know'st ; Thou from the first</l>
     <l n="20">Wast present , and with mighty wings outspread 20</l>
     <l n="21">Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss</l>
     <l n="22">And mad'st it pregnant : What in me is dark</l>
     <l n="23">Illumine , what is low raise and support ;</l>
     <l n="24">That to the highth of this great Argument</l>
     <l n="25">I may assert th ’ Eternal Providence ,</l>
     <l n="26">And justifie the wayes of God to men .</l>
     <l n="27">Say first , for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view</l>
     <l n="28">Nor the deep Tract of Hell , say first what cause</l>
     <l n="29">Mov 'd our Grand Parents in that happy State ,</l>
     <l n="30">Favour 'd of Heav'n so highly , to fall off 30</l>
     <l n="31">From their Creator , and transgress his Will</l>
     <l n="32">For one restraint , Lords of the World besides ?</l>
     <l n="33">Who first seduc 'd them to that fowl revolt ?</l>
     <l n="34">Th ’ infernal Serpent ; he it was , whose guile</l>
     <l n="35">Stird up with Envy and Revenge , deceiv 'd</l>
     <l n="36">The Mother of Mankinde , what time his Pride</l>
     <l n="37">Had cast him out from Heav'n , with all his Host</l>
     <l n="38">Of Rebel Angels , by whose aid aspiring</l>
     <l n="39">To set himself in Glory above his Peers ,</l>
     <l n="40">He trusted to have equal 'd the most High , 40</l>
     <l n="41">If he oppos 'd ; and with ambitious aim</l>
     <l n="42">Against the Throne and Monarchy of God</l>
     <l n="43">Rais 'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud</l>
     <l n="44">With vain attempt . Him the Almighty Power</l>
     <l n="45">Hurld headlong flaming from th ’ Ethereal Skie</l>
     <l n="46">With hideous ruine and combustion down</l>
     <l n="47">To bottomless perdition , there to dwell</l>
     <l n="48">In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire ,</l>
     <l n="49">Who durst defie th ’ Omnipotent to Arms .</l>
     <l n="50">Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night 50</l>
     <l n="51">To mortal men , he with his horrid crew</l>
     <l n="52">Lay vanquisht , rowling in the fiery Gulfe</l>
     <l n="53">Confounded though immortal : But his doom</l>
     <l n="54">Reserv 'd him to more wrath ; for now the thought</l>
     <l n="55">Both of lost happiness and lasting pain</l>
     <l n="56">Torments him ; round he throws his baleful eyes</l>
     <l n="57">That witness 'd huge affliction and dismay</l>
     <l n="58">Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate :</l>
     <l n="59">At once as far as Angels kenn he views</l>
     <l n="60">The dismal Situation waste and wilde , 60</l>
     <l n="61">A Dungeon horrible , on all sides round</l>
     <l n="62">As one great Furnace flam 'd , yet from those flames</l>
     <l n="63">No light , but rather darkness visible</l>
     <l n="64">Serv 'd only to discover sights of woe ,</l>
     <l n="65">Regions of sorrow , doleful shades , where peace</l>
     <l n="66">And rest can never dwell , hope never comes</l>
     <l n="67">That comes to all ; but torture without end</l>
     <l n="68">Still urges , and a fiery Deluge , fed</l>
     <l n="69">With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum 'd :</l>
     <l n="70">Such place Eternal Justice had prepar 'd 70</l>
     <l n="71">For those rebellious , here their Prison ordain 'd</l>
     <l n="72">In utter darkness , and their portion set</l>
     <l n="73">As far remov 'd from God and light of Heav'n</l>
     <l n="74">As from the Center thrice to th ’ utmost Pole .</l>
     <l n="75">O how unlike the place from whence they fell !</l>
     <l n="76">There the companions of his fall , o'rewhelm ' d</l>
     <l n="77">With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire ,</l>
     <l n="78">He soon discerns , and weltring by his side</l>
     <l n="79">One next himself in power , and next in crime ,</l>
     <l n="80">Long after known in Palestine , and nam 'd 80</l>
     <l n="81">Beelzebub . To whom th ’ Arch-Enemy ,</l>
     <l n="82">And thence in Heav'n call 'd Satan , with bold words</l>
     <l n="83">Breaking the horrid silence thus began .</l>
     <l n="84">If thou beest he ; But O how fall'n ! how chang 'd</l>
     <l n="85">From him , who in the happy Realms of Light</l>
     <l n="86">Cloth 'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine</l>
     <l n="87">Myriads though bright : If he whom mutual league ,</l>
     <l n="88">United thoughts and counsels , equal hope ,</l>
     <l n="89">And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize ,</l>
     <l n="90">Joynd with me once , now misery hath joynd 90</l>
     <l n="91">In equal ruin : into what Pit thou seest</l>
     <l n="92">From what highth fal'n , so much the stronger provd</l>
     <l n="93">He with his Thunder : and till then who knew</l>
     <l n="94">The force of those dire Arms ? yet not for those</l>
     <l n="95">Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage</l>
     <l n="96">Can else inflict do I repent or change ,</l>
     <l n="97">Though chang 'd in outward lustre ; that fixt mind</l>
     <l n="98">And high disdain , from sence of injur 'd merit ,</l>
     <l n="99">That with the mightiest rais 'd me to contend ,</l>
     <l n="100">And to the fierce contention brought along 100</l>
     <l n="101">Innumerable force of Spirits arm 'd</l>
     <l n="102">That durst dislike his reign , and me preferring ,</l>
     <l n="103">His utmost power with adverse power oppos 'd</l>
     <l n="104">In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n ,</l>
     <l n="105">And shook his throne . What though the field be lost ?</l>
     <l n="106">All is not lost ; the unconquerable Will ,</l>
     <l n="107">And study of revenge , immortal hate ,</l>
     <l n="108">And courage never to submit or yield :</l>
     <l n="109">And what is else not to be overcome ?</l>
     <l n="110">That Glory never shall his wrath or might 110</l>
     <l n="111">Extort from me . To bow and sue for grace</l>
     <l n="112">With suppliant knee , and deifie his power</l>
     <l n="113">Who from the terrour of this Arm so late</l>
     <l n="114">Doubted his Empire , that were low indeed ,</l>
     <l n="115">That were an ignominy and shame beneath</l>
     <l n="116">This downfall ; since by Fate the strength of Gods</l>
     <l n="117">And this Empyreal substance cannot fail ,</l>
     <l n="118">Since through experience of this great event</l>
     <l n="119">In Arms not worse , in foresight much advanc't ,</l>
     <l n="120">We may with more successful hope resolve 120</l>
     <l n="121">To wage by force or guile eternal Warr</l>
     <l n="122">Irreconcileable , to our grand Foe ,</l>
     <l n="123">Who now triumphs , and in th ’ excess of joy</l>
     <l n="124">Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n .</l>
     <l n="125">So spake th ’ Apostate Angel , though in pain ,</l>
     <l n="126">Vaunting aloud , but rackt with deep despare :</l>
     <l n="127">And him thus answer 'd soon his bold Compeer .</l>
     <l n="128">O Prince , O Chief of many Throned Powers ,</l>
     <l n="129">That led th ’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr</l>
     <l n="130">Under thy conduct , and in dreadful deeds 130</l>
     <l n="131">Fearless , endanger 'd Heav'ns perpetual King ;</l>
     <l n="132">And put to proof his high Supremacy ,</l>
     <l n="133">Whether upheld by strength , or Chance , or Fate ,</l>
     <l n="134">Too well I see and rue the dire event ,</l>
     <l n="135">That with sad overthrow and foul defeat</l>
     <l n="136">Hath lost us Heav'n , and all this mighty Host</l>
     <l n="137">In horrible destruction laid thus low ,</l>
     <l n="138">As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences</l>
     <l n="139">Can Perish : for the mind and spirit remains</l>
     <l n="140">Invincible , and vigour soon returns , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Though all our Glory extinct , and happy state</l>
     <l n="142">Here swallow 'd up in endless misery .</l>
     <l n="143">But what if he our Conquerour , ( whom I now</l>
     <l n="144">Of force believe Almighty , since no less</l>
     <l n="145">Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours )</l>
     <l n="146">Have left us this our spirit and strength intire</l>
     <l n="147">Strongly to suffer and support our pains ,</l>
     <l n="148">That we may so suffice his vengeful ire ,</l>
     <l n="149">Or do him mightier service as his thralls</l>
     <l n="150">By right of Warr , what e 're his business be 150</l>
     <l n="151">Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire ,</l>
     <l n="152">Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep ;</l>
     <l n="153">What can it then avail though yet we feel</l>
     <l n="154">Strength undiminisht , or eternal being</l>
     <l n="155">To undergo eternal punishment ?</l>
     <l n="156">Whereto with speedy words th ’ Arch-fiend reply 'd .</l>
     <l n="157">Fall'n Cherube , to be weak is miserable</l>
     <l n="158">Doing or Suffering : but of this be sure ,</l>
     <l n="159">To do ought good never will be our task ,</l>
     <l n="160">But ever to do ill our sole delight , 160</l>
     <l n="161">As being the contrary to his high will</l>
     <l n="162">Whom we resist . If then his Providence</l>
     <l n="163">Out of our evil seek to bring forth good ,</l>

     <l n="460">In his own Temple , on the grunsel edge , 460</l>
     <l n="461">Where he fell flat , and sham 'd his Worshipers :</l>

     <l n="467">Him follow 'd Rimmon , whose delightful Seat</l>

     <l n="469">Of Abbana and Pharphar , lucid streams .</l>
     <l n="470">He also against the house of God was bold : 470</l>

     <l n="661">For who can think Submission ? Warr then , Warr</l>
     <l n="662">Open or understood must be resolv 'd .</l>
     <l n="663">He spake : and to confirm his words , out-flew</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The Consultation begun , Satan debates whether another Battel be to be hazarded for the recovery of Heaven : some advise it , others dissuade : A third proposal is prefer 'd , mention 'd before by Satan , to search the truth of that Prophesie or Tradition in Heaven concerning another world , and another kind of creature equal or much inferiour to themselves , about this time to be created : Thir doubt who shall be sent on this difficult search : Satan thir cheif undertakes alone the voyage , is honourd and applauded . The Councel thus ended , the rest betake them several wayes and to several imployments , as thir inclinations lead them , to entertain the time till Satan return . He passes on his Journey to Hell Gates , finds them shut , and who sat there to guard them , by whom at length they are op'nd , and discover to him the great Gulf between Hell and Heaven ; with what difficulty he passes through , directed by Chaos the Power of that place , to the sight of this new World which he sought .</head>

     <l n="76">That in our proper motion we ascend</l>
     <l n="77">Up to our native seat : descent and fall</l>

     <l n="79">When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear</l>
     <l n="80">Insulting , and pursu 'd us through the Deep ,</l>

     <l n="84">Our stronger , some worse way his wrath may find</l>

     <l n="86">Fear to be worse destroy 'd : what can be worse</l>
     <l n="87">Then to dwell here , driv'n out from bliss , condemn 'd</l>
     <l n="88">In this abhorred deep to utter woe ;</l>
     <l n="89">Where pain of unextinguishable fire</l>
     <l n="90">Must exercise us without hope of end</l>
     <l n="91">The Vassals of his anger , when the Scourge 90</l>
     <l n="92">Inexorably , and the torturing houre</l>
     <l n="93">Calls us to Penance ? More destroy 'd then thus</l>
     <l n="94">We should be quite abolisht and expire .</l>
     <l n="95">What fear we then ? what doubt we to incense</l>
     <l n="96">His utmost ire ? which to the highth enrag 'd ,</l>
     <l n="97">Will either quite consume us , and reduce</l>
     <l n="98">To nothing this essential , happier farr</l>
     <l n="99">Then miserable to have eternal being :</l>
     <l n="100">Or if our substance be indeed Divine ,</l>
     <l n="101">And cannot cease to be , we are at worst 100</l>
     <l n="102">On this side nothing ; and by proof we feel</l>
     <l n="103">Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n ,</l>
     <l n="104">And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme ,</l>
     <l n="105">Though inaccessible , his fatal Throne :</l>
     <l n="106">Which if not Victory is yet Revenge .</l>
     <l n="107">He ended frowning , and his look denounc 'd</l>
     <l n="108">Desperate revenge , and Battel dangerous</l>
     <l n="109">To less then Gods . On th ’ other side up rose</l>
     <l n="110">Belial , in act more graceful and humane ;</l>
     <l n="111">A fairer person lost not Heav'n ; he seemd 110</l>
     <l n="112">For dignity compos 'd and high exploit :</l>
     <l n="113">But all was false and hollow ; though his Tongue</l>
     <l n="114">Dropt Manna , and could make the worse appear</l>
     <l n="115">The better reason , to perplex and dash</l>
     <l n="116">Maturest Counsels : for his thoughts were low ;</l>
     <l n="117">To vice industrious , but to Nobler deeds</l>
     <l n="118">Timorous and slothful : yet he pleas 'd the eare ,</l>
     <l n="119">And with perswasive accent thus began .</l>
     <l n="120">I should be much for open Warr , O Peers ,</l>
     <l n="121">As not behind in hate ; if what was urg 'd 120</l>
     <l n="122">Main reason to perswade immediate Warr ,</l>
     <l n="123">Did not disswade me most , and seem to cast</l>
     <l n="124">Ominous conjecture on the whole success :</l>
     <l n="125">When he who most excels in fact of Arms ,</l>
     <l n="126">In what he counsels and in what excels</l>
     <l n="127">Mistrustful , grounds his courage on despair</l>
     <l n="128">And utter dissolution , as the scope</l>
     <l n="129">Of all his aim , after some dire revenge .</l>
     <l n="130">First , what Revenge ? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill 'd</l>
     <l n="131">With Armed watch , that render all access 130</l>
     <l n="132">Impregnable ; oft on the bordering Deep</l>
     <l n="133">Encamp thir Legions , or with obscure wing</l>
     <l n="134">Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night ,</l>
     <l n="135">Scorning surprize . Or could we break our way</l>
     <l n="136">By force , and at our heels all Hell should rise</l>
     <l n="137">With blackest Insurrection , to confound</l>
     <l n="138">Heav'ns purest Light , yet our great Enemie</l>
     <l n="139">All incorruptible would on his Throne</l>
     <l n="140">Sit unpolluted , and th ’ Ethereal mould</l>
     <l n="141">Incapable of stain would soon expel 140</l>
     <l n="142">Her mischief , and purge off the baser fire</l>
     <l n="143">Victorious . Thus repuls 'd , our final hope</l>
     <l n="144">Is flat despair : we must exasperate</l>
     <l n="145">Th ’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage ,</l>
     <l n="146">And that must end us , that must be our cure ,</l>
     <l n="147">To be no more ; sad cure ; for who would loose ,</l>
     <l n="148">Though full of pain , this intellectual being ,</l>
     <l n="149">Those thoughts that wander through Eternity ,</l>
     <l n="150">To perish rather , swallowd up and lost</l>
     <l n="151">In the wide womb of uncreated night , 150</l>
     <l n="152">Devoid of sense and motion ? and who knows ,</l>
     <l n="153">Let this be good , whether our angry Foe</l>
     <l n="154">Can give it , or will ever ? how he can</l>
     <l n="155">Is doubtful ; that he never will is sure .</l>
     <l n="156">Will he , so wise , let loose at once his ire ,</l>
     <l n="157">Belike through impotence , or unaware ,</l>
     <l n="158">To give his Enemies thir wish , and end</l>
     <l n="159">Them in his anger , whom his anger saves</l>
     <l n="160">To punish endless ? wherefore cease we then ?</l>
     <l n="161">Say they who counsel Warr , we are decreed , 160</l>
     <l n="162">Reserv 'd and destin 'd to Eternal woe ;</l>
     <l n="163">Whatever doing , what can we suffer more ,</l>
     <l n="164">What can we suffer worse ? is this then worst ,</l>
     <l n="165">Thus sitting , thus consulting , thus in Arms ?</l>
     <l n="166">What when we fled amain , pursu 'd and strook</l>
     <l n="167">With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder , and besought</l>
     <l n="168">The Deep to shelter us ? this Hell then seem 'd</l>
     <l n="169">A refuge from those wounds : or when we lay</l>
     <l n="170">Chain 'd on the burning Lake ? that sure was worse .</l>
     <l n="171">What if the breath that kindl 'd those grim fires 170</l>
     <l n="172">Awak 'd should blow them into sevenfold rage</l>
     <l n="173">And plunge us in the Flames ? or from above</l>
     <l n="174">Should intermitted vengeance Arme again</l>
     <l n="175">His red right hand to plague us ? what if all</l>
     <l n="176">Her stores were op'n ' d , and this Firmament</l>
     <l n="177">Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire ,</l>
     <l n="178">Impendent horrors , threatning hideous fall</l>
     <l n="179">One day upon our heads ; while we perhaps</l>
     <l n="180">Designing or exhorting glorious Warr ,</l>
     <l n="181">Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl 'd 180</l>
     <l n="182">Each on his rock transfixt , the sport and prey</l>
     <l n="183">Of racking whirlwinds , or for ever sunk</l>
     <l n="184">Under yon boyling Ocean , wrapt in Chains ;</l>
     <l n="185">There to converse with everlasting groans ,</l>
     <l n="186">Unrespited , unpitied , unrepreevd ,</l>
     <l n="187">Ages of hopeless end ; this would be worse .</l>
     <l n="188">Warr therefore , open or conceal 'd , alike</l>
     <l n="189">My voice disswades ; for what can force or guile</l>
     <l n="190">With him , or who deceive his mind , whose eye</l>
     <l n="191">Views all things at one view ? he from heav'ns highth 190</l>
     <l n="192">All these our motions vain , sees and derides ;</l>
     <l n="193">Not more Almighty to resist our might</l>
     <l n="194">Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles .</l>
     <l n="195">Shall we then live thus vile , the race of Heav'n</l>
     <l n="196">Thus trampl 'd , thus expell 'd to suffer here</l>
     <l n="197">Chains and these Torments ? better these then worse</l>
     <l n="198">By my advice ; since fate inevitable</l>
     <l n="199">Subdues us , and Omnipotent Decree ,</l>
     <l n="200">The Victors will . To suffer , as to doe ,</l>
     <l n="201">Our strength is equal , nor the Law unjust 200</l>
     <l n="202">That so ordains : this was at first resolv 'd ,</l>
     <l n="203">If we were wise , against so great a foe</l>
     <l n="204">Contending , and so doubtful what might fall .</l>
     <l n="205">I laugh , when those who at the Spear are bold</l>
     <l n="206">And vent'rous , if that fail them , shrink and fear</l>
     <l n="207">What yet they know must follow , to endure</l>
     <l n="208">Exile , or ignominy , or bonds , or pain ,</l>
     <l n="209">The sentence of thir Conquerour : This is now</l>
     <l n="210">Our doom ; which if we can sustain and bear ,</l>
     <l n="211">Our Supream Foe in time may much remit 210</l>
     <l n="212">His anger , and perhaps thus farr remov 'd</l>
     <l n="213">Not mind us not offending , satisfi 'd</l>
     <l n="214">With what is punish't ; whence these raging fires</l>
     <l n="215">Will slack'n , if his breath stir not thir flames .</l>
     <l n="216">Our purer essence then will overcome</l>
     <l n="217">Thir noxious vapour , or enur 'd not feel ,</l>
     <l n="218">Or chang 'd at length , and to the place conformd</l>
     <l n="219">In temper and in nature , will receive</l>
     <l n="220">Familiar the fierce heat , and void of pain ;</l>
     <l n="221">This horror will grow milde , this darkness light , 220</l>
     <l n="222">Besides what hope the never-ending flight</l>
     <l n="223">Of future days may bring , what chance , what change</l>
     <l n="224">Worth waiting , since our present lot appeers</l>
     <l n="225">For happy though but ill , for ill not worst ,</l>
     <l n="226">If we procure not to our selves more woe .</l>
     <l n="227">Thus Belial with words cloath 'd in reasons garb</l>
     <l n="228">Counsel 'd ignoble ease , and peaceful sloath ,</l>
     <l n="229">Not peace : and after him thus Mammon spake .</l>
     <l n="230">Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n</l>
     <l n="231">We warr , if warr be best , or to regain 230</l>

     <l n="233">May hope , when everlasting Fate shall yeild</l>

     <l n="242">Strict Laws impos 'd , to celebrate his Throne</l>

    <head>BOOK III .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>God sitting on his Throne sees Satan flying towards this world , then newly created ; shews him to the Son who sat at his right hand ; foretells the success of Satan in perverting mankind ; clears his own Justice and Wisdom from all imputation , having created Man free and able enough to have withstood his Tempter ; yet declares his purpose of grace towards him , in regard he fell not of his own malice , as did Satan , but by him seduc't . The Son of God renders praises to his father for the manifestation of his gracious purpose towards Man ; God again declares , that Grace cannot be extended towards Man without the satisfaction of divine Justice ; Man hath offended the majesty of God by aspiring to Godhead , and therefore with all his progeny devoted to death must dye , unless some one can be found sufficient to answer for his offence , and undergoe his Punishment . The Son of God freely offers himself a Ransome for Man : the Father accepts him , ordains his incarnation , pronounces his exaltation above all in Heaven and Earth , commands all the Angels to adore him ; they obey , amid hymning to their Harps in full Quire , celebrate the Father and the Son .. Mean while Satan alights upon the bare convex of this Worlds outermost Orb ; where wandring he first finds a place since call 'd The Lymbo of Vanity , what persons and things fly up thither ; thence comes to the Gate of Heaven , describ 'd ascending by stairs and the waters above the Firmament that flow about it : His passage thence to the Orb of the Sun ; he finds there Uriel the Regent of that Orb , but first changes himself into the shape of a meaner Angel ; and pretending a zealous desire to behold the new Creation and Man whom God had plac't here , inquires of him the place of his habitation , and is directed ; alights first on Mount Niphates .</head>

     <l n="92">By som false guile pervert ; and shall pervert ;</l>
     <l n="93">For man will heark'n to his glozing lyes ,</l>

     <l n="95">Sole pledge of his obedience : So will fall</l>
     <l n="96">Hee and his faithless Progenie : whose fault ?</l>
     <l n="97">Whose but his own ? ingrate , he had of mee</l>
     <l n="98">All he could have ; I made him just and right ,</l>
     <l n="99">Sufficient to have stood , though free to fall .</l>
     <l n="100">Such I created all th ’ Ethereal Powers 100</l>

     <l n="104">Of true allegiance , constant Faith or Love ,</l>
     <l n="105">Where onely what they needs must do , appeard ,</l>
     <l n="106">Not what they would ? what praise could they receive ?</l>
     <l n="107">What pleasure I from such obedience paid ,</l>
     <l n="108">When Will and Reason ( Reason also is choice )</l>
     <l n="109">Useless and vain , of freedom both despoild ,</l>
     <l n="110">Made passive both , had servd necessitie , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Not mee . They therefore as to right belongd ,</l>
     <l n="112">So were created , nor can justly accuse</l>
     <l n="113">Thir maker , or thir making , or thir Fate ;</l>
     <l n="114">As if Predestination over-rul 'd</l>
     <l n="115">Thir will , dispos 'd by absolute Decree</l>

     <l n="117">Thir own revolt , not I : if I foreknew ,</l>

     <l n="119">Which had no less prov 'd certain unforeknown .</l>
     <l n="120">So without least impulse or shadow of Fate , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Or aught by me immutablie foreseen ,</l>
     <l n="122">They trespass , Authors to themselves in all</l>
     <l n="123">Both what they judge and what they choose ; for so</l>
     <l n="124">I formd them free , and free they must remain ,</l>
     <l n="125">Till they enthrall themselves : I else must change</l>

     <l n="155">Of all things made , and judgest onely right .</l>
     <l n="156">Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain</l>

     <l n="158">His malice , and thy goodness bring to naught ,</l>
     <l n="159">Or proud return though to his heavier doom ,</l>
     <l n="160">Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell 160</l>
     <l n="161">Draw after him the whole Race of mankind ,</l>

     <l n="624">His back was turnd , but not his brightness hid ;</l>
     <l n="625">Of beaming sunnie Raies , a golden tiar</l>
     <l n="626">Circl 'd his Head , nor less his Locks behind</l>
     <l n="627">Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings</l>
     <l n="628">Lay waving round ; on som great charge imploy 'd</l>
     <l n="629">Hee seemd , or fixt in cogitation deep .</l>
     <l n="630">Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope 630</l>

     <l n="634">But first he casts to change his proper shape ,</l>
     <l n="635">Which else might work him danger or delay :</l>
     <l n="636">And now a stripling Cherube he appeers ,</l>
     <l n="637">Not of the prime , yet such as in his face</l>
     <l n="638">Youth smil 'd Celestial , and to every Limb</l>
     <l n="639">Sutable grace diffus 'd , so well he feignd ;</l>
     <l n="640">Under a Coronet his flowing haire 640</l>
     <l n="641">In curles on either cheek plaid , wings he wore</l>
     <l n="642">Of many a colourd plume sprinkl 'd with Gold ,</l>
     <l n="643">His habit fit for speed succinct , and held</l>
     <l n="644">Before his decent steps a Silver wand .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Satan now in prospect of Eden , and nigh the place where he must now attempt the bold enterprize which he undertook alone against God and Man , falls into many doubts with himself , and many passions , fear , envy , and despare ; but at length confirms himself in evil , journeys on to Paradise , whose outward prospect and scituation is described , overleaps the bounds , sits in the shape of a Cormorant on the tree of life , as highest in the Garden to look about him . The Garden describ 'd ; Satans first sight of Adam and Eve ; his wonder at thir excellent form and happy state but with resolution to work thir fall ; overhears thir discourse , thence gathers that the Tree of knowledge was forbidden them to eat of , under penalty of death ; and thereon intends to found his temptation , by seducing them to transgress : then leaves them a while to know further of thir state by some other means . Mean while Uriel descending on a Sunbeam warns Gabriel , who had in charge the Gate of Paradise , that some evil spirit had escap 'd the Deep , and past at Noon by his Sphere in the shape of a good Angel down to Paradise , discovered after by his furious gestures in the Mount . Gabriel promises to find him out ere morning . Night coming on , Adam and Eve discourse of going to thir rest : thir Bower describ 'd ; thir Evening worship . Gabriel drawing forth his Bands of Night-watch to walk the round of Paradise , appoints two strong Angels to Adams Bower , least the evill spirit should be there doing some harm to Adam or Eve sleeping ; there they find him at the ear of Eve , tempting her in a dream , and bring him , though unwilling , to Gabriel ; by whom question 'd he scornfully answers , prepares resistance , but hinder 'd by a Sign from Heaven , flies out of Paradise .</head>
     <l n="1">O For that warning voice , which he who saw</l>
     <l n="2">Th ’ Apocalyps , heard cry in Heaven aloud ,</l>
     <l n="3">Then when the Dragon , put to second rout ,</l>
     <l n="4">Came furious down to be reveng 'd on men ,</l>
     <l n="5">Wo To The Inhabitants On Earth ! that now ,</l>
     <l n="6">While time was , our first Parents had bin warnd</l>
     <l n="7">The coming of thir secret foe , and scap 'd</l>
     <l n="8">Haply so scap 'd his mortal snare ; for now</l>
     <l n="9">Satan , now first inflam 'd with rage , came down ,</l>
     <l n="10">The Tempter ere th ’ Accuser of man-kind , 10</l>
     <l n="11">To wreck on innocent frail man his loss</l>
     <l n="12">Of that first Battel , and his flight to Hell :</l>
     <l n="13">Yet not rejoycing in his speed , though bold ,</l>
     <l n="14">Far off and fearless , nor with cause to boast ,</l>
     <l n="15">Begins his dire attempt , which nigh the birth</l>
     <l n="16">Now rowling , boiles in his tumultuous brest ,</l>
     <l n="17">And like a devillish Engine back recoiles</l>
     <l n="18">Upon himself ; horror and doubt distract</l>
     <l n="19">His troubl 'd thoughts , and from the bottom stirr</l>
     <l n="20">The Hell within him , for within him Hell 20</l>
     <l n="21">He brings , and round about him , nor from Hell</l>
     <l n="22">One step no more then from himself can fly</l>
     <l n="23">By change of place : Now conscience wakes despair</l>
     <l n="24">That slumberd , wakes the bitter memorie</l>
     <l n="25">Of what he was , what is , and what must be</l>
     <l n="26">Worse ; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue .</l>
     <l n="27">Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view</l>
     <l n="28">Lay pleasant , his grievd look he fixes sad ,</l>
     <l n="29">Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre : 30</l>
     <l n="31">Then much revolving , thus in sighs began .</l>
     <l n="32">O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd ,</l>
     <l n="33">Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God</l>
     <l n="34">Of this new World ; at whose sight all the Starrs</l>
     <l n="35">Hide thir diminisht heads ; to thee I call ,</l>
     <l n="36">But with no friendly voice , and add thy name</l>
     <l n="37">O Sun , to tell thee how I hate thy beams</l>
     <l n="38">That bring to my remembrance from what state</l>
     <l n="39">I fell , how glorious once above thy Spheare ;</l>
     <l n="40">Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down 40</l>
     <l n="41">Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King :</l>
     <l n="42">Ah wherefore ! he deservd no such return</l>
     <l n="43">From me , whom he created what I was</l>
     <l n="44">In that bright eminence , and with his good</l>
     <l n="45">Upbraided none ; nor was his service hard .</l>
     <l n="46">What could be less then to afford him praise ,</l>
     <l n="47">The easiest recompence , and pay him thanks ,</l>
     <l n="48">How due ! yet all his good prov 'd ill in me ,</l>
     <l n="49">And wrought but malice ; lifted up so high</l>
     <l n="50">I sdeind subjection , and thought one step higher 50</l>
     <l n="51">Would set me highest , and in a moment quit</l>
     <l n="52">The debt immense of endless gratitude ,</l>
     <l n="53">So burthensome , still paying , still to ow ;</l>
     <l n="54">Forgetful what from him I still receivd ,</l>
     <l n="55">And understood not that a grateful mind</l>
     <l n="56">By owing owes not , but still pays , at once</l>
     <l n="57">Indebted and dischargd ; what burden then ?</l>
     <l n="58">O had his powerful Destiny ordaind</l>
     <l n="59">Me some inferiour Angel , I had stood</l>
     <l n="60">Then happie ; no unbounded hope had rais 'd 60</l>
     <l n="61">Ambition . Yet why not ? som other Power</l>
     <l n="62">As great might have aspir 'd , and me though mean</l>
     <l n="63">Drawn to his part ; but other Powers as great</l>
     <l n="64">Fell not , but stand unshak'n , from within</l>
     <l n="65">Or from without , to all temptations arm 'd .</l>
     <l n="66">Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand ?</l>
     <l n="67">Thou hadst : whom hast thou then or what to accuse ,</l>
     <l n="68">But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all ?</l>
     <l n="69">Be then his Love accurst , since love or hate ,</l>
     <l n="70">To me alike , it deals eternal woe . 70</l>
     <l n="71">Nay curs 'd be thou ; since against his thy will</l>
     <l n="72">Chose freely what it now so justly rues .</l>
     <l n="73">Me miserable ! which way shall I flie</l>
     <l n="74">Infinite wrauth , and infinite despaire ?</l>
     <l n="75">Which way I flie is Hell ; my self am Hell ;</l>
     <l n="76">And in the lowest deep a lower deep</l>
     <l n="77">Still threatning to devour me opens wide ,</l>
     <l n="78">To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n .</l>
     <l n="79">O then at last relent : is there no place</l>
     <l n="80">Left for Repentance , none for Pardon left ? 80</l>
     <l n="81">None left but by submission ; and that word</l>
     <l n="82">Disdain forbids me , and my dread of shame</l>
     <l n="83">Among the spirits beneath , whom I seduc 'd</l>
     <l n="84">With other promises and other vaunts</l>
     <l n="85">Then to submit , boasting I could subdue</l>
     <l n="86">Th ’ Omnipotent . Ay me , they little know</l>
     <l n="87">How dearly I abide that boast so vaine ,</l>
     <l n="88">Under what torments inwardly I groane ;</l>
     <l n="89">While they adore me on the Throne of Hell ,</l>
     <l n="90">With Diadem and Scepter high advanc 'd 90</l>
     <l n="91">The lower still I fall , onely Supream</l>
     <l n="92">In miserie ; such joy Ambition findes .</l>
     <l n="93">But say I could repent and could obtaine</l>
     <l n="94">By Act of Grace my former state ; how soon</l>
     <l n="95">Would highth recal high thoughts , how soon unsay</l>
     <l n="96">What feign 'd submission swore : ease would recant</l>
     <l n="97">Vows made in pain , as violent and void .</l>
     <l n="98">For never can true reconcilement grow</l>
     <l n="99">Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc 'd so deep :</l>
     <l n="100">Which would but lead me to a worse relapse 100</l>
     <l n="101">And heavier fall : so should I purchase deare</l>
     <l n="102">Short intermission bought with double smart .</l>
     <l n="103">This knows my punisher ; therefore as farr</l>
     <l n="104">From granting hee , as I from begging peace :</l>
     <l n="105">All hope excluded thus , behold in stead</l>
     <l n="106">Of us out-cast , exil 'd , his new delight ,</l>
     <l n="107">Mankind created , and for him this World .</l>
     <l n="108">So farwel Hope , and with Hope farwel Fear ,</l>
     <l n="109">Farwel Remorse : all Good to me is lost ;</l>
     <l n="110">Evil be thou my Good ; by thee at least 110</l>
     <l n="111">Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold</l>
     <l n="112">By thee , and more then half perhaps will reigne ;</l>
     <l n="113">As Man ere long , and this new World shall know .</l>
     <l n="114">Thus while he spake , each passion dimm 'd his face</l>
     <l n="115">Thrice chang 'd with pale , ire , envie and despair ,</l>
     <l n="116">Which marrd his borrow 'd visage , and betraid</l>
     <l n="117">Him counterfet , if any eye beheld .</l>
     <l n="118">For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule</l>
     <l n="119">Are ever cleer . Whereof hee soon aware ,</l>
     <l n="120">Each perturbation smooth 'd with outward calme , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Artificer of fraud ; and was the first</l>
     <l n="122">That practisd falshood under saintly shew ,</l>
     <l n="123">Deep malice to conceale , couch't with revenge :</l>
     <l n="124">Yet not anough had practisd to deceive</l>
     <l n="125">Uriel once warnd ; whose eye pursu 'd him down</l>
     <l n="126">The way he went , and on th ’ Assyrian mount</l>
     <l n="127">Saw him disfigur 'd , more then could befall</l>
     <l n="128">Spirit of happie sort : his gestures fierce</l>
     <l n="129">He markd and mad demeanour , then alone ,</l>
     <l n="130">As he suppos 'd , all unobserv 'd , unseen . 130</l>
     <l n="131">So on he fares , and to the border comes</l>
     <l n="132">Of Eden , where delicious Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="133">Now nearer , Crowns with her enclosure green ,</l>
     <l n="134">As with a rural mound the champain head</l>
     <l n="135">Of a steep wilderness , whose hairie sides</l>
     <l n="136">With thicket overgrown , grottesque and wilde ,</l>
     <l n="137">Access deni 'd ; and over head up grew</l>
     <l n="138">Insuperable highth of loftiest shade ,</l>
     <l n="139">Cedar , and Pine , and Firr , and branching Palm ,</l>
     <l n="140">A Silvan Scene , and as the ranks ascend 140</l>
     <l n="141">Shade above shade , a woodie Theatre</l>
     <l n="142">Of stateliest view . Yet higher then thir tops</l>
     <l n="143">The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung :</l>
     <l n="144">Which to our general Sire gave prospect large</l>
     <l n="145">Into his neather Empire neighbouring round .</l>
     <l n="146">And higher then that Wall a circling row</l>
     <l n="147">Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit ,</l>
     <l n="148">Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue</l>
     <l n="149">Appeerd , with gay enameld colours mixt :</l>
     <l n="150">On which the Sun more glad impress 'd his beams 150</l>
     <l n="151">Then in fair Evening Cloud , or humid Bow ,</l>
     <l n="152">When God hath showrd the earth ; so lovely seemd</l>
     <l n="153">That Lantskip : And of pure now purer aire</l>
     <l n="154">Meets his approach , and to the heart inspires</l>
     <l n="155">Vernal delight and joy , able to drive</l>
     <l n="156">All sadness but despair : now gentle gales</l>

     <l n="158">Native perfumes , and whisper whence they stole</l>
     <l n="159">Those balmie spoiles . As when to them who saile</l>

     <l n="171">From Media post to Aegypt , there fast bound .</l>
     <l n="172">Now to th ’ ascent of that steep savage Hill</l>

     <l n="454">Of waters issu 'd from a Cave and spread</l>
     <l n="455">Into a liquid Plain , then stood unmov 'd</l>
     <l n="456">Pure as th ’ expanse of Heav'n ; I thither went</l>
     <l n="457">With unexperienc't thought , and laid me downe</l>
     <l n="458">On the green bank , to look into the cleer</l>
     <l n="459">Smooth Lake , that to me seemd another Skie .</l>
     <l n="460">As I bent down to look , just opposite , 460</l>
     <l n="461">A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd</l>
     <l n="462">Bending to look on me , I started back ,</l>
     <l n="463">It started back , but pleasd I soon returnd ,</l>
     <l n="464">Pleas 'd it returnd as soon with answering looks</l>
     <l n="465">Of sympathie and love , there I had fixt</l>
     <l n="466">Mine eyes till now , and pin 'd with vain desire ,</l>
     <l n="467">Had not a voice thus warnd me , What thou seest ,</l>
     <l n="468">What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self ,</l>
     <l n="469">With thee it came and goes : but follow me ,</l>
     <l n="470">And I will bring thee where no shadow staies 470</l>
     <l n="471">Thy coming , and thy soft imbraces , hee</l>
     <l n="472">Whose image thou art , him thou shall enjoy</l>
     <l n="473">Inseparablie thine , to him shalt beare</l>
     <l n="474">Multitudes like thy self , and thence be call 'd</l>
     <l n="475">Mother of human Race : what could I doe ,</l>
     <l n="476">But follow strait , invisibly thus led ?</l>
     <l n="477">Till I espi 'd thee , fair indeed and tall ,</l>
     <l n="478">Under a Platan , yet methought less faire ,</l>
     <l n="479">Less winning soft , less amiablie milde ,</l>
     <l n="480">Then that smooth watry image ; back I turnd , 480</l>
     <l n="481">Thou following cryd'st aloud , Return fair Eve ,</l>
     <l n="482">Whom fli'st thou ? whom thou fli'st , of him thou art ,</l>
     <l n="483">His flesh , his bone ; to give thee being I lent</l>
     <l n="484">Out of my side to thee , neerest my heart</l>
     <l n="485">Substantial Life , to have thee by my side</l>
     <l n="486">Henceforth an individual solace dear ;</l>
     <l n="487">Part of my Soul I seek thee , and thee claim</l>
     <l n="488">My other half : with that thy gentle hand</l>
     <l n="489">Seisd mine , I yeilded , and from that time see</l>
     <l n="490">How beauty is excelld by manly grace 490</l>
     <l n="491">And wisdom , which alone is truly fair .</l>
     <l n="492">So spake our general Mother , and with eyes</l>
     <l n="493">Of conjugal attraction unreprov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="494">And meek surrender , half imbracing leand</l>
     <l n="495">On our first Father , half her swelling Breast</l>
     <l n="496">Naked met his under the flowing Gold</l>
     <l n="497">Of her loose tresses hid : he in delight</l>
     <l n="498">Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms</l>
     <l n="499">Smil 'd with superior Love , as Jupiter</l>
     <l n="500">On Juno smiles , when he impregns the Clouds 500</l>
     <l n="501">That shed May Flowers ; and press 'd her Matron lip</l>
     <l n="502">With kisses pure : aside the Devil turnd</l>
     <l n="503">For envie , yet with jealous leer maligne</l>
     <l n="504">Ey 'd them askance , and to himself thus plaind .</l>
     <l n="505">Sight hateful , sight tormenting ! thus these two</l>
     <l n="506">Imparadis't in one anothers arms</l>
     <l n="507">The happier Eden , shall enjoy thir fill</l>
     <l n="508">Of bliss on bliss , while I to Hell am thrust ,</l>
     <l n="509">Where neither joy nor love , but fierce desire ,</l>
     <l n="510">Among our other torments not the least , 510</l>
     <l n="511">Still unfulfill 'd with pain of longing pines ;</l>
     <l n="512">Yet let me not forget what I have gain 'd</l>
     <l n="513">From thir own mouths ; all is not theirs it seems :</l>
     <l n="514">One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call 'd ,</l>
     <l n="515">Forbidden them to taste : Knowledge forbidd'n ?</l>
     <l n="516">Suspicious , reasonless . Why should thir Lord</l>
     <l n="517">Envie them that ? can it be sin to know ,</l>
     <l n="518">Can it be death ? and do they onely stand</l>
     <l n="519">By Ignorance , is that thir happie state ,</l>
     <l n="520">The proof of thir obedience and thir faith ? 520</l>
     <l n="521">O fair foundation laid whereon to build</l>
     <l n="522">Thir ruine ! Hence I will excite thir minds</l>
     <l n="523">With more desire to know , and to reject</l>
     <l n="524">Envious commands , invented with designe</l>
     <l n="525">To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt</l>
     <l n="526">Equal with Gods ; aspiring to be such ,</l>
     <l n="527">They taste and die : what likelier can ensue ?</l>
     <l n="528">But first with narrow search I must walk round</l>
     <l n="529">This Garden , and no corner leave unspi 'd ;</l>
     <l n="530">A chance but chance may lead where I may meet 530</l>
     <l n="531">Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n , by Fountain side ,</l>
     <l n="532">Or in thick shade retir 'd , from him to draw</l>
     <l n="533">What further would be learnt . Live while ye may ,</l>
     <l n="534">Yet happie pair ; enjoy , till I return ,</l>
     <l n="535">Short pleasures , for long woes are to succeed .</l>
     <l n="536">So saying , his proud step he scornful turn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="537">But with sly circumspection , and began</l>
     <l n="538">Through wood , through waste , o 're hil , o 're dale his roam .</l>
     <l n="539">Mean while in utmost Longitude , where Heav'n</l>
     <l n="540">With Earth and Ocean meets , the setting Sun 540</l>
     <l n="541">Slowly descended , and with right aspect</l>
     <l n="542">Against the eastern Gate of Paradise</l>
     <l n="543">Leveld his eevning Rayes : it was a Rock</l>
     <l n="544">Of Alablaster , pil 'd up to the Clouds ,</l>
     <l n="545">Conspicuous farr , winding with one ascent</l>
     <l n="546">Accessible from Earth , one entrance high ;</l>
     <l n="547">The rest was craggie cliff , that overhung</l>
     <l n="548">Still as it rose , impossible to climbe .</l>
     <l n="549">Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat</l>
     <l n="550">Chief of th ’ Angelic Guards , awaiting night ; 550</l>
     <l n="551">About him exercis 'd Heroic Games</l>
     <l n="552">Th ’ unarmed Youth of Heav'n , but nigh at hand</l>
     <l n="553">Celestial Armourie , Shields , Helmes , and Speares</l>
     <l n="554">Hung high with Diamond flaming , and with Gold .</l>
     <l n="555">Thither came Uriel , gliding through the Eeven</l>
     <l n="556">On a Sun beam , swift as a shooting Starr</l>
     <l n="557">In Autumn thwarts the night , when vapors fir 'd</l>
     <l n="558">Impress the Air , and shews the Mariner</l>
     <l n="559">From what point of his Compass to beware</l>
     <l n="560">Impetuous winds : he thus began in haste . 560</l>
     <l n="561">Gabriel , to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv'n</l>
     <l n="562">Charge and strict watch that to this happie place</l>
     <l n="563">No evil thing approach or enter in ;</l>
     <l n="564">This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare</l>
     <l n="565">A Spirit , zealous , as he seem 'd , to know</l>
     <l n="566">More of th ’ Almighties works , and chiefly Man</l>
     <l n="567">Gods latest Image : I describ 'd his way</l>
     <l n="568">Bent all on speed , and markt his Aerie Gate ;</l>
     <l n="569">But in the Mount that lies from Eden North ,</l>
     <l n="570">Where he first lighted , soon discernd his looks 570</l>
     <l n="571">Alien from Heav'n , with passions foul obscur 'd :</l>
     <l n="572">Mine eye pursu 'd him still , but under shade</l>
     <l n="573">Lost sight of him ; one of the banisht crew</l>
     <l n="574">I fear , hath ventur 'd from the deep , to raise</l>
     <l n="575">New troubles ; him thy care must be to find .</l>
     <l n="576">To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd :</l>
     <l n="577">Uriel , no wonder if thy perfet sight ,</l>
     <l n="578">Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst ,</l>
     <l n="579">See farr and wide : in at this Gate none pass</l>
     <l n="580">The vigilance here plac't , but such as come 580</l>
     <l n="581">Well known from Heav'n ; and since Meridian hour</l>
     <l n="582">No Creature thence : if Spirit of other sort ,</l>
     <l n="583">So minded , have oreleapt these earthie bounds</l>
     <l n="584">On purpose , hard thou knowst it to exclude</l>
     <l n="585">Spiritual substance with corporeal barr .</l>
     <l n="586">But if within the circuit of these walks</l>
     <l n="587">In whatsoever shape he lurk , of whom</l>
     <l n="588">Thou telst , by morrow dawning I shall know .</l>
     <l n="589">So promis 'd hee , and Uriel to his charge</l>
     <l n="590">Returnd on that bright beam , whose point now raisd 590</l>
     <l n="591">Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n</l>
     <l n="592">Beneath th ’ Azores ; whither the prime Orb ,</l>
     <l n="593">Incredible how swift , had thither rowl 'd</l>
     <l n="594">Diurnal , or this less volubil Earth</l>
     <l n="595">By shorter flight to th ’ East , had left him there</l>
     <l n="596">Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold</l>
     <l n="597">The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend :</l>
     <l n="598">Now came still Eevning on , and Twilight gray</l>
     <l n="599">Had in her sober Liverie all things clad ;</l>
     <l n="600">Silence accompanied , for Beast and Bird , 600</l>
     <l n="601">They to thir grassie Couch , these to thir Nests</l>
     <l n="602">Were slunk , all but the wakeful Nightingale ;</l>
     <l n="603">She all night long her amorous descant sung ;</l>
     <l n="604">Silence was pleas 'd : now glow 'd the Firmament</l>
     <l n="605">With living Saphirs : Hesperus that led</l>
     <l n="606">The starrie Host , rode brightest , till the Moon</l>
     <l n="607">Rising in clouded Majestie , at length</l>
     <l n="608">Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light ,</l>
     <l n="609">And o 're the dark her Silver Mantle threw .</l>
     <l n="610">When Adam thus to Eve : Fair Consort , th ’ hour 610</l>
     <l n="611">Of night , and all things now retir 'd to rest</l>
     <l n="612">Mind us of like repose , since God hath set</l>
     <l n="613">Labour and rest , as day and night to men</l>
     <l n="614">Successive , and the timely dew of sleep</l>
     <l n="615">Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines</l>
     <l n="616">Our eye-lids ; other Creatures all day long</l>
     <l n="617">Rove idle unimploid , and less need rest ;</l>
     <l n="618">Man hath his daily work of body or mind</l>
     <l n="619">Appointed , which declares his Dignitie ,</l>
     <l n="620">And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies ; 620</l>

     <l n="623">Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East</l>
     <l n="624">With first approach of light , we must be ris'n ,</l>
     <l n="625">And at our pleasant labour , to reform</l>
     <l n="626">Yon flourie Arbors , yonder Allies green ,</l>
     <l n="627">Our walks at noon , with branches overgrown ,</l>
     <l n="628">That mock our scant manuring , and require</l>
     <l n="629">More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth :</l>
     <l n="630">Those Blossoms also , and those dropping Gumms , 630</l>
     <l n="631">That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth ,</l>
     <l n="632">Ask riddance , if we mean to tread with ease ;</l>
     <l n="633">Mean while , as Nature wills , Night bids us rest .</l>
     <l n="634">To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd .</l>
     <l n="635">My Author and Disposer , what thou bidst</l>
     <l n="636">Unargu 'd I obey ; so God ordains ,</l>
     <l n="637">God is thy Law , thou mine : to know no more</l>

     <l n="640">All seasons and thir change , all please alike . 640</l>
     <l n="641">Sweet is the breath of morn , her rising sweet ,</l>
     <l n="642">With charm of earliest Birds ; pleasant the Sun</l>
     <l n="643">When first on this delightful Land he spreads</l>

     <l n="680">Both day and night : how often from the steep 680</l>
     <l n="681">Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard</l>
     <l n="682">Celestial voices to the midnight air ,</l>
     <l n="683">Sole , or responsive each to others note</l>

     <l n="828">Know ye not me ? ye knew me once no mate</l>
     <l n="829">For you , there sitting where ye durst not soare ;</l>

     <l n="839">Departed from thee , and thou resembl'st now</l>
     <l n="840">Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule . 840</l>
     <l n="841">But come , for thou , be sure , shalt give account</l>
     <l n="842">To him who sent us , whose charge is to keep</l>
     <l n="843">This place inviolable , and these from harm .</l>
     <l n="844">So spake the Cherube , and his grave rebuke</l>
     <l n="845">Severe in youthful beautie , added grace</l>
     <l n="846">Invincible : abasht the Devil stood ,</l>
     <l n="847">And felt how awful goodness is , and saw</l>
     <l n="848">Vertue in her shape how lovly , saw , and pin 'd</l>
     <l n="849">His loss ; but chiefly to find here observd</l>
     <l n="850">His lustre visibly impar 'd ; yet seemd 850</l>
     <l n="851">Undaunted . If I must contend , said he ,</l>
     <l n="852">Best with the best , the Sender not the sent ,</l>
     <l n="853">Or all at once ; more glorie will be wonn ,</l>
     <l n="854">Or less be lost . Thy fear , said Zephon bold ,</l>
     <l n="855">Will save us trial what the least can doe</l>
     <l n="856">Single against thee wicked , and thence weak .</l>
     <l n="857">The Fiend repli 'd not , overcome with rage ;</l>
     <l n="858">But like a proud Steed reind , went hautie on ,</l>
     <l n="859">Chaumping his iron curb : to strive or flie</l>
     <l n="860">He held it vain ; awe from above had quelld 860</l>
     <l n="861">His heart , not else dismai 'd . Now drew they nigh</l>
     <l n="862">The western point , where those half-rounding guards</l>
     <l n="863">Just met , &amp; closing stood in squadron joind</l>
     <l n="864">Awaiting next command . To whom thir Chief</l>
     <l n="865">Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud .</l>
     <l n="866">O friends , I hear the tread of nimble feet</l>
     <l n="867">Hasting this way , and now by glimps discerne</l>
     <l n="868">Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade ,</l>
     <l n="869">And with them comes a third of Regal port ,</l>
     <l n="870">But faded splendor wan ; who by his gate 870</l>
     <l n="871">And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell ,</l>
     <l n="872">Not likely to part hence without contest ;</l>
     <l n="873">Stand firm , for in his look defiance lours .</l>
     <l n="874">He scarce had ended , when those two approachd</l>
     <l n="875">And brief related whom they brought , wher found ,</l>
     <l n="876">How busied , in what form and posture coucht .</l>
     <l n="877">To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake .</l>
     <l n="878">Why hast thou , Satan , broke the bounds prescrib 'd</l>
     <l n="879">To thy transgressions , and disturbd the charge</l>
     <l n="880">Of others , who approve not to transgress 880</l>
     <l n="881">By thy example , but have power and right</l>
     <l n="882">To question thy bold entrance on this place ;</l>
     <l n="883">Imploi 'd it seems to violate sleep , and those</l>
     <l n="884">Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss ?</l>
     <l n="885">To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow .</l>
     <l n="886">Gabriel , thou hadst in Heav'n th ’ esteem of wise ,</l>
     <l n="887">And such I held thee ; but this question askt</l>
     <l n="888">Puts me in doubt . Lives ther who loves his pain ?</l>
     <l n="889">Who would not , finding way , break loose from Hell ,</l>
     <l n="890">Though thither doomd ? Thou wouldst thy self , no doubt , 890</l>
     <l n="891">And boldly venture to whatever place</l>
     <l n="892">Farthest from pain , where thou mightst hope to change</l>
     <l n="893">Torment with ease , &amp; soonest recompence</l>
     <l n="894">Dole with delight , which in this place I sought ;</l>
     <l n="895">To thee no reason ; who knowst only good ,</l>
     <l n="896">But evil hast not tri 'd : and wilt object</l>
     <l n="897">His will who bound us ? let him surer barr</l>
     <l n="898">His Iron Gates , if he intends our stay</l>
     <l n="899">In that dark durance : thus much what was askt .</l>
     <l n="900">The rest is true , they found me where they say ; 900</l>
     <l n="901">But that implies not violence or harme .</l>
     <l n="902">Thus hee in scorn . The warlike Angel mov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="903">Disdainfully half smiling thus repli 'd .</l>
     <l n="904">O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise ,</l>
     <l n="905">Since Satan fell , whom follie overthrew ,</l>
     <l n="906">And now returns him from his prison scap't ,</l>
     <l n="907">Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise</l>
     <l n="908">Or not , who ask what boldness brought him hither</l>
     <l n="909">Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib 'd ;</l>
     <l n="910">So wise he judges it to fly from pain 910</l>
     <l n="911">However , and to scape his punishment .</l>
     <l n="912">So judge thou still , presumptuous , till the wrauth ,</l>
     <l n="913">Which thou incurr'st by flying , meet thy flight</l>
     <l n="914">Seavenfold , and scourge that wisdom back to Hell ,</l>
     <l n="915">Which taught thee yet no better , that no pain</l>
     <l n="916">Can equal anger infinite provok't .</l>
     <l n="917">But wherefore thou alone ? wherefore with thee</l>
     <l n="918">Came not all Hell broke loose ? is pain to them</l>
     <l n="919">Less pain , less to be fled , or thou then they</l>
     <l n="920">Less hardie to endure ? courageous Chief , 920</l>
     <l n="921">The first in flight from pain , had'st thou alleg 'd</l>
     <l n="922">To thy deserted host this cause of flight ,</l>
     <l n="923">Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive .</l>
     <l n="924">To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern .</l>
     <l n="925">Not that I less endure , or shrink from pain ,</l>
     <l n="926">Insulting Angel , well thou knowst I stood</l>
     <l n="927">Thy fiercest , when in Battel to thy aide</l>

     <l n="929">And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear .</l>
     <l n="930">But still thy words at random , as before , 930</l>
     <l n="931">Argue thy inexperience what behooves</l>
     <l n="932">From hard assaies and ill successes past</l>
     <l n="933">A faithful Leader , not to hazard all</l>
     <l n="934">Through wayes of danger by himself untri 'd .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Morning approach't , Eve relates to Adam her troublesome dream : he likes it not , yet comforts her : They come forth to thir day labours : Their Morning Hymn at the Door of their Bower . God to render Man inexcusable sends Raphael to admonish him of his obedience , of his free estate , of his enemy near at hand ; who he is , and why his enemy , and whatever else may avail Adam to know . Raphael comes down to Paradise ; his appearance describ 'd , his coming discern 'd by Adam afar off sitting at the door of his Bower ; he goes out to meet him , brings him to his lodge , entertains him with the choycest fruits of Paradise got together by Eve ; their discourse at Table : Raphael performs his message , minds Adam of his state and of his enemy ; relates at Adams request who that enemy is , and how he came to be so , beginning with his first revolt in Heaven and the occasion thereof ; how he drew his Legions after him to the parts of the North , and there incited them to rebel with him , perswading all but only Abdiel a Seraph , who in Argument diswades and opposes him , then forsakes him .</head>

     <l n="5">And temperat vapors bland , which th ’ only sound</l>
     <l n="6">Of leaves and fuming rills , Aurora 's fan ,</l>
     <l n="7">Lightly dispers 'd , and the shrill Matin Song</l>
     <l n="8">Of Birds on every bough ; so much the more</l>
     <l n="9">His wonder was to find unwak'nd Eve</l>
     <l n="10">With Tresses discompos 'd , and glowing Cheek , 10</l>
     <l n="11">As through unquiet rest : he on his side</l>
     <l n="12">Leaning half-rais 'd , with looks of cordial Love</l>
     <l n="13">Hung over her enamour 'd , and beheld</l>
     <l n="14">Beautie , which whether waking or asleep ,</l>
     <l n="15">Shot forth peculiar Graces ; then with voice</l>
     <l n="16">Milde , as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes ,</l>
     <l n="17">Her hand soft touching , whisperd thus . Awake</l>
     <l n="18">My fairest , my espous 'd , my latest found ,</l>
     <l n="19">Heav'ns last best gift , my ever new delight ,</l>
     <l n="20">Awake , the morning shines , and the fresh field 20</l>
     <l n="21">Calls us , we lose the prime , to mark how spring</l>
     <l n="22">Our tended Plants , how blows the Citron Grove ,</l>
     <l n="23">What drops the Myrrhe , &amp; what the balmie Reed ,</l>
     <l n="24">How Nature paints her colours , how the Bee</l>
     <l n="25">Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet .</l>
     <l n="26">Such whispering wak 'd her , but with startl 'd eye</l>
     <l n="27">On Adam , whom imbracing , thus she spake .</l>
     <l n="28">O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose ,</l>
     <l n="29">My Glorie , my Perfection , glad I see</l>
     <l n="30">Thy face , and Morn return 'd , for I this Night , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Such night till this I never pass 'd , have dream 'd ,</l>
     <l n="32">If dream 'd , not as I oft am wont , of thee ,</l>
     <l n="33">Works of day pass't , or morrows next designe ,</l>
     <l n="34">But of offence and trouble , which my mind</l>
     <l n="35">Knew never till this irksom night ; methought</l>
     <l n="36">Close at mine ear one call 'd me forth to walk</l>
     <l n="37">With gentle voice , I thought it thine ; it said ,</l>
     <l n="38">Why sleepst thou Eve ? now is the pleasant time ,</l>
     <l n="39">The cool , the silent , save where silence yields</l>
     <l n="40">To the night-warbling Bird , that now awake 40</l>
     <l n="41">Tunes sweetest his love-labor 'd song ; now reignes</l>
     <l n="42">Full Orb 'd the Moon , and with more pleasing light</l>
     <l n="43">Shadowie sets off the face of things ; in vain ,</l>
     <l n="44">If none regard ; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="45">Whom to behold but thee , Natures desire ,</l>
     <l n="46">In whose sight all things joy , with ravishment</l>
     <l n="47">Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze .</l>
     <l n="48">I rose as at thy call , but found thee not ;</l>
     <l n="49">To find thee I directed then my walk ;</l>
     <l n="50">And on , methought , alone I pass 'd through ways 50</l>
     <l n="51">That brought me on a sudden to the Tree</l>
     <l n="52">Of interdicted Knowledge : fair it seem 'd ,</l>
     <l n="53">Much fairer to my Fancie then by day :</l>
     <l n="54">And as I wondring lookt , beside it stood</l>
     <l n="55">One shap 'd and wing 'd like one of those from Heav'n</l>
     <l n="56">By us oft seen ; his dewie locks distill 'd</l>
     <l n="57">Ambrosia ; on that Tree he also gaz 'd ;</l>
     <l n="58">And O fair Plant , said he , with fruit surcharg 'd ,</l>
     <l n="59">Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet ,</l>
     <l n="60">Nor God , nor Man ; is Knowledge so despis 'd ? 60</l>
     <l n="61">Or envie , or what reserve forbids to taste ?</l>
     <l n="62">Forbid who will , none shall from me withhold</l>
     <l n="63">Longer thy offerd good , why else set here ?</l>
     <l n="64">This said he paus 'd not , but with ventrous Arme</l>
     <l n="65">He pluckt , he tasted ; mee damp horror chil 'd</l>
     <l n="66">At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold :</l>
     <l n="67">But he thus overjoy 'd , O Fruit Divine ,</l>
     <l n="68">Sweet of thy self , but much more sweet thus cropt ,</l>
     <l n="69">Forbidd'n here , it seems , as onely fit</l>
     <l n="70">For Gods , yet able to make Gods of Men : 70</l>
     <l n="71">And why not Gods of Men , since good , the more</l>
     <l n="72">Communicated , more abundant growes ,</l>
     <l n="73">The Author not impair 'd , but honourd more ?</l>
     <l n="74">Here , happie Creature , fair Angelic Eve ,</l>
     <l n="75">Partake thou also ; happie though thou art ,</l>
     <l n="76">Happier thou mayst be , worthier canst not be :</l>
     <l n="77">Taste this , and be henceforth among the Gods</l>
     <l n="78">Thy self a Goddess , not to Earth confind ,</l>
     <l n="79">But somtimes in the Air , as wee , somtimes</l>
     <l n="80">Ascend to Heav'n , by merit thine , and see 80</l>
     <l n="81">What life the Gods live there , and such live thou .</l>
     <l n="82">So saying , he drew nigh , and to me held ,</l>
     <l n="83">Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part</l>
     <l n="84">Which he had pluckt ; the pleasant savourie smell</l>
     <l n="85">So quick'nd appetite , that I , methought ,</l>
     <l n="86">Could not but taste . Forthwith up to the Clouds</l>
     <l n="87">With him I flew , and underneath beheld</l>
     <l n="88">The Earth outstretcht immense , a prospect wide</l>
     <l n="89">And various : wondring at my flight and change</l>
     <l n="90">To this high exaltation ; suddenly 90</l>
     <l n="91">My Guide was gon , and I , me thought , sunk down ,</l>
     <l n="92">And fell asleep ; but O how glad I wak 'd</l>
     <l n="93">To find this but a dream ! Thus Eve her Night</l>
     <l n="94">Related , and thus Adam answerd sad .</l>
     <l n="95">Best Image of my self and dearer half ,</l>
     <l n="96">The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep</l>
     <l n="97">Affects me equally ; nor can I like</l>
     <l n="98">This uncouth dream , of evil sprung I fear ;</l>
     <l n="99">Yet evil whence ? in thee can harbour none ,</l>
     <l n="100">Created pure . But know that in the Soule 100</l>
     <l n="101">Are many lesser Faculties that serve</l>
     <l n="102">Reason as chief ; among these Fansie next</l>
     <l n="103">Her office holds ; of all external things ,</l>
     <l n="104">Which the five watchful Senses represent ,</l>
     <l n="105">She forms Imaginations , Aerie shapes ,</l>
     <l n="106">Which Reason joyning or disjoyning , frames</l>
     <l n="107">All what we affirm or what deny , and call</l>
     <l n="108">Our knowledge or opinion ; then retires</l>
     <l n="109">Into her private Cell when Nature rests .</l>
     <l n="110">Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes 110</l>
     <l n="111">To imitate her ; but misjoyning shapes ,</l>
     <l n="112">Wilde work produces oft , and most in dreams ,</l>
     <l n="113">Ill matching words and deeds long past or late .</l>
     <l n="114">Som such resemblances methinks I find</l>
     <l n="115">Of our last Eevnings talk , in this thy dream ,</l>
     <l n="116">But with addition strange ; yet be not sad .</l>
     <l n="117">Evil into the mind of God or Man</l>
     <l n="118">May come and go , so unapprov 'd , and leave</l>
     <l n="119">No spot or blame behind : Which gives me hope</l>
     <l n="120">That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Waking thou never wilt consent to do .</l>
     <l n="122">Be not disheart'nd then , nor cloud those looks</l>
     <l n="123">That wont to be more chearful and serene</l>
     <l n="124">Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World ,</l>
     <l n="125">And let us to our fresh imployments rise</l>
     <l n="126">Among the Groves , the Fountains , and the Flours</l>
     <l n="127">That open now thir choicest bosom 'd smells</l>
     <l n="128">Reservd from night , and kept for thee in store .</l>
     <l n="129">So cheard he his fair Spouse , and she was cheard ,</l>
     <l n="130">But silently a gentle tear let fall 130</l>
     <l n="131">From either eye , and wip 'd them with her haire ;</l>
     <l n="132">Two other precious drops that ready stood ,</l>
     <l n="133">Each in thir chrystal sluce , hee ere they fell</l>
     <l n="134">Kiss 'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse</l>
     <l n="135">And pious awe , that feard to have offended .</l>
     <l n="136">So all was cleard , and to the Field they haste .</l>
     <l n="137">But first from under shadie arborous roof ,</l>
     <l n="138">Soon as they forth were come to open sight</l>
     <l n="139">Of day-spring , and the Sun , who scarce up risen</l>
     <l n="140">With wheels yet hov'ring o 're the Ocean brim , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray ,</l>
     <l n="142">Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East</l>
     <l n="143">Of Paradise and Edens happie Plains ,</l>
     <l n="144">Lowly they bow 'd adoring , and began</l>
     <l n="145">Thir Orisons , each Morning duly paid</l>
     <l n="146">In various style , for neither various style</l>
     <l n="147">Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise</l>
     <l n="148">Thir Maker , in fit strains pronounc't or sung</l>
     <l n="149">Unmeditated , such prompt eloquence</l>
     <l n="150">Flowd from thir lips , in Prose or numerous Verse , 150</l>
     <l n="151">More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp</l>
     <l n="152">To add more sweetness , and they thus began .</l>
     <l n="153">These are thy glorious works , Parent of good ,</l>
     <l n="154">Almightie , thine this universal Frame ,</l>
     <l n="155">Thus wondrous fair ; thy self how wondrous then !</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Raphael continues to relate how Michael and Gabriel were sent forth to Battel against Satan and his Angels . The first Fight describ 'd : Satan and his Powers retire under Night : he calls a Councel , invents devilish Engines , which in the second dayes Fight put Michael and his Angels to some disorder ; But they at length pulling up Mountains overwhelm 'd both the force and Machins of Satan : Yet the Tumult not so ending , God on the third day sends Messiah his Son , for whom he had reserv 'd the glory of that Victory . Hee in the Power of his Father coming to the place , and causing all his Legions to stand still on either side , with his Chariot and Thunder driving into the midst of his Enemies , pursues them unable to resist towards the wall of Heaven ; which opening , they leap down with horror and confusion into the place of punishment prepar 'd for them in the Deep : Messiah returns with triumph to his Father .</head>

     <l n="1">All night the dreadless Angel unpursu 'd</l>

     <l n="3">Wak't by the circling Hours , with rosie hand</l>
     <l n="4">Unbarr 'd the gates of Light . There is a Cave</l>
     <l n="5">Within the Mount of God , fast by his Throne ,</l>
     <l n="6">Where light and darkness in perpetual round</l>
     <l n="7">Lodge and dislodge by turns , which makes through Heav'n</l>
     <l n="8">Grateful vicissitude , like Day and Night ;</l>
     <l n="9">Light issues forth , and at the other dore</l>
     <l n="10">Obsequious darkness enters , till her houre 10</l>
     <l n="11">To veile the Heav'n , though darkness there might well</l>
     <l n="12">Seem twilight here ; and now went forth the Morn</l>
     <l n="13">Such as in highest Heav'n , arrayd in Gold</l>
     <l n="14">Empyreal , from before her vanisht Night ,</l>
     <l n="15">Shot through with orient Beams : when all the Plain</l>

     <l n="17">Chariots and flaming Armes , and fierie Steeds</l>
     <l n="18">Reflecting blaze on blaze , first met his view :</l>

     <l n="20">Already known what he for news had thought 20</l>
     <l n="21">To have reported : gladly then he mixt</l>

     <l n="26">They led him high applauded , and present</l>
     <l n="27">Before the seat supream ; from whence a voice</l>
     <l n="28">From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard .</l>
     <l n="29">Servant of God , well done , well hast thou fought</l>
     <l n="30">The better fight , who single hast maintaind 30</l>
     <l n="31">Against revolted multitudes the Cause</l>

     <l n="35">Then violence : for this was all thy care</l>
     <l n="36">To stand approv 'd in sight of God , though Worlds</l>

     <l n="38">Remains thee , aided by this host of friends ,</l>

     <l n="83">Of rigid Spears , and Helmets throng 'd , and Shields</l>
     <l n="84">Various , with boastful Argument portraid ,</l>
     <l n="85">The banded Powers of Satan hasting on</l>
     <l n="86">With furious expedition ; for they weend</l>
     <l n="87">That self same day by fight , or by surprize</l>
     <l n="88">To win the Mount of God , and on his Throne</l>
     <l n="89">To set the envier of his State , the proud</l>
     <l n="90">Aspirer , but thir thoughts prov 'd fond and vain 90</l>
     <l n="91">In the mid way : though strange to us it seemd</l>
     <l n="92">At first , that Angel should with Angel warr ,</l>
     <l n="93">And in fierce hosting meet , who wont to meet</l>
     <l n="94">So oft in Festivals of joy and love</l>
     <l n="95">Unanimous , as sons of one great Sire</l>
     <l n="96">Hymning th ’ Eternal Father : but the shout</l>
     <l n="97">Of Battel now began , and rushing sound</l>
     <l n="98">Of onset ended soon each milder thought .</l>
     <l n="99">High in the midst exalted as a God</l>
     <l n="100">Th ’ Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate 100</l>
     <l n="101">Idol of Majestie Divine , enclos 'd</l>

     <l n="104">‘ Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left ,</l>
     <l n="105">A dreadful interval , and Front to Front</l>
     <l n="106">Presented stood in terrible array</l>
     <l n="107">Of hideous length : before the cloudie Van ,</l>
     <l n="108">On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="109">Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't ,</l>
     <l n="110">Came towring , armd in Adamant and Gold ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Abdiel that sight endur 'd not , where he stood</l>
     <l n="112">Among the mightiest , bent on highest deeds ,</l>
     <l n="113">And thus his own undaunted heart explores .</l>
     <l n="114">O Heav'n ! that such resemblance of the Highest</l>
     <l n="115">Should yet remain , where faith and realtie</l>
     <l n="116">Remain not ; wherfore should not strength &amp; might</l>

     <l n="119">His puissance , trusting in th ’ Almightie 's aide ,</l>
     <l n="120">I mean to try , whose Reason I have tri 'd 120</l>
     <l n="121">Unsound and false ; nor is it aught but just ,</l>
     <l n="122">That he who in debate of Truth hath won ,</l>
     <l n="123">Should win in Arms , in both disputes alike</l>
     <l n="124">Victor ; though brutish that contest and foule ,</l>
     <l n="125">When Reason hath to deal with force , yet so</l>
     <l n="126">Most reason is that Reason overcome .</l>
     <l n="127">So pondering , and from his armed Peers</l>

     <l n="129">His daring foe , at this prevention more</l>

     <l n="138">Have rais 'd incessant Armies to defeat</l>
     <l n="139">Thy folly ; or with solitarie hand</l>
     <l n="140">Reaching beyond all limit , at one blow 140</l>

     <l n="175">Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains ,</l>
     <l n="176">Or Nature ; God and Nature bid the same ,</l>
     <l n="177">When he who rules is worthiest , and excells</l>

     <l n="618">If our proposals once again were heard</l>
     <l n="619">We should compel them to a quick result .</l>
     <l n="620">To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood . 620</l>
     <l n="621">Leader , the terms we sent were terms of weight ,</l>

    <head>Adam inquires concerning celestial Motions , is doubtfully answer 'd and exhorted to search rather things more worthy of knowledg : Adam assents , and still desirous to detain Raphael , relates to him what he remember 'd since his own Creation , his placing in Paradise , his talk with God concerning solitude and fit society , his first meeting and Nuptials with Eve , his discourse with the Angel thereupon ; who after admonitions repeated departs .</head>

     <l n="300">So saying , by the hand he took me rais 'd , 300</l>
     <l n="301">And over Fields and Waters , as in Aire</l>
     <l n="302">Smooth sliding without step , last led me up</l>
     <l n="303">A woodie Mountain ; whose high top was plaine ,</l>
     <l n="304">A Circuit wide , enclos 'd , with goodliest Trees</l>
     <l n="305">Planted , with Walks , and Bowers , that what I saw</l>
     <l n="306">Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd . Each Tree</l>
     <l n="307">Load'n with fairest Fruit , that hung to the Eye</l>
     <l n="308">Tempting , stirr 'd in me sudden appetite</l>
     <l n="309">To pluck and eate ; whereat I wak 'd , and found</l>
     <l n="310">Before mine Eyes all real , as the dream 310</l>
     <l n="311">Had lively shadowd : Here had new begun</l>
     <l n="312">My wandring , had not hee who was my Guide</l>
     <l n="313">Up hither , from among the Trees appeer 'd ,</l>
     <l n="314">Presence Divine . Rejoycing , but with aw</l>
     <l n="315">In adoration at his feet I fell</l>
     <l n="316">Submiss : he rear 'd me , &amp; Whom thou soughtst I am ,</l>
     <l n="317">Said mildely , Author of all this thou seest</l>
     <l n="318">Above , or round about thee or beneath .</l>
     <l n="319">This Paradise I give thee , count it thine</l>
     <l n="320">To Till and keep , and of the Fruit to eate : 320</l>
     <l n="321">Of every Tree that in the Garden growes</l>
     <l n="322">Eate freely with glad heart ; fear here no dearth :</l>
     <l n="323">But of the Tree whose operation brings</l>
     <l n="324">Knowledg of good and ill , which I have set</l>
     <l n="325">The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith ,</l>
     <l n="326">Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life ,</l>
     <l n="327">Remember what I warne thee , shun to taste ,</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Satan having compast the Earth , with meditated guile returns as a mist by Night into Paradise , enters into the Serpent sleeping . Adam and Eve in the Morning go forth to thir labours , which Eve proposes to divide in several places , each labouring apart : Adam consents not , alledging the danger , lest that Enemy , of whom they were forewarn 'd , should attempt her found alone : Eve loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough , urges her going apart , the rather desirous to make tryal of her strength ; Adam at last yields : The Serpent finds her alone ; his subtle approach , first gazing , then speaking with much flattery extolling Eve above all other Creatures . Eve wondring to hear the Serpent speak , asks how he attain 'd to human speech and such understanding not till now ; the Serpent answers , that by tasting of a certain Tree in the Garden he attain 'd both to Speech and Reason , till then void of both : Eve requires him to bring her to that Tree , and finds it to be the Tree of Knowledge forbidden : The Serpent now grown bolder , with many wiles and arguments induces her at length to eat ; she pleas 'd with the taste deliberates awhile whether to impart thereof to Adam or not , at last brings him of the Fruit , relates what persuaded her to eat thereof : Adam at first amaz 'd , but perceiving her lost , resolves through vehemence of love to perish with her ; and extenuating the trespass , eats also of the Fruit : The effects thereof in them both ; they seek to cover thir nakedness ; then fall to variance and accusation of one another .</head>

     <l n="353">But bid her well beware , and still erect ,</l>
     <l n="354">Least by some faire appeering good surpris 'd</l>
     <l n="355">She dictate false , and missinforme the Will</l>
     <l n="356">To do what God expresly hath forbid .</l>
     <l n="357">Not then mistrust , but tender love enjoynes ,</l>
     <l n="358">That I should mind thee oft , and mind thou me .</l>
     <l n="359">Firm we subsist , yet possible to swerve ,</l>
     <l n="360">Since Reason not impossibly may meet 360</l>
     <l n="361">Some specious object by the Foe subornd ,</l>
     <l n="362">And fall into deception unaware ,</l>
     <l n="363">Not keeping strictest watch , as she was warnd .</l>
     <l n="364">Seek not temptation then , which to avoide</l>
     <l n="365">Were better , and most likelie if from mee</l>
     <l n="366">Thou sever not ; Trial will come unsought .</l>
     <l n="367">Wouldst thou approve thy constancie , approve</l>
     <l n="368">First thy obedience ; th ’ other who can know ,</l>
     <l n="369">Not seeing thee attempted , who attest ?</l>
     <l n="370">But if thou think , trial unsought may finde 370</l>
     <l n="371">Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst ,</l>
     <l n="372">Go ; for thy stay , not free , absents thee more ;</l>
     <l n="373">Go in thy native innocence , relie</l>
     <l n="374">On what thou hast of vertue , summon all ,</l>
     <l n="375">For God towards thee hath done his part , do thine .</l>
     <l n="376">So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde , but Eve</l>
     <l n="377">Persisted , yet submiss , though last , repli 'd .</l>
     <l n="378">With thy permission then , and thus forewarnd</l>
     <l n="379">Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words</l>
     <l n="380">Touchd onely , that our trial , when least sought , 380</l>
     <l n="381">May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar 'd ,</l>
     <l n="382">The willinger I goe , nor much expect</l>
     <l n="383">A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek ;</l>
     <l n="384">So bent , the more shall shame him his repulse .</l>
     <l n="385">Thus saying , from her Husbands hand her hand</l>
     <l n="386">Soft she withdrew , and like a Wood-Nymph light</l>
     <l n="387">Oread or Dryad , or of Delia 's Traine ,</l>
     <l n="388">Betook her to the Groves , but Delia 's self</l>
     <l n="389">In gate surpass 'd and Goddess-like deport ,</l>
     <l n="390">Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd , 390</l>
     <l n="391">But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude ,</l>
     <l n="392">Guiltless of fire had formd , or Angels brought ,</l>
     <l n="393">To Pales , or Pomona , thus adornd ,</l>
     <l n="394">Likest she seemd , Pomona when she fled</l>
     <l n="395">Vertumnus , or to Ceres in her Prime ,</l>
     <l n="396">Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove .</l>
     <l n="397">Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu 'd</l>

     <l n="399">Oft he to her his charge of quick returne ,</l>
     <l n="400">Repeated , shee to him as oft engag 'd 400</l>
     <l n="401">To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre ,</l>

     <l n="403">Noontide repast , or Afternoons repose .</l>
     <l n="404">O much deceav 'd , much failing , hapless Eve ,</l>
     <l n="405">Of thy presum 'd return ! event perverse !</l>
     <l n="406">Thou never from that houre in Paradise</l>
     <l n="407">Foundst either sweet repast , or found repose ;</l>
     <l n="408">Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades</l>
     <l n="409">Waited with hellish rancor imminent</l>
     <l n="410">To intercept thy way , or send thee back 410</l>
     <l n="411">Despoild of Innocence , of Faith , of Bliss .</l>
     <l n="412">For now , and since first break of dawne the Fiend ,</l>
     <l n="413">Meer Serpent in appearance , forth was come ,</l>
     <l n="414">And on his Quest , where likeliest he might finde</l>
     <l n="415">The onely two of Mankinde , but in them</l>
     <l n="416">The whole included Race , his purposd prey .</l>
     <l n="417">In Bowre and Field he sought , where any tuft</l>
     <l n="418">Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay ,</l>
     <l n="419">Thir tendance or Plantation for delight ,</l>
     <l n="420">By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet 420</l>
     <l n="421">He sought them both , but wish 'd his hap might find</l>
     <l n="422">Eve separate , he wish 'd , but not with hope</l>
     <l n="423">Of what so seldom chanc 'd , when to his wish ,</l>
     <l n="424">Beyond his hope , Eve separate he spies ,</l>
     <l n="425">Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance , where she stood ,</l>
     <l n="426">Half spi 'd , so thick the Roses bushing round</l>
     <l n="427">About her glowd , oft stooping to support</l>
     <l n="428">Each Flour of slender stalk , whose head though gay</l>
     <l n="429">Carnation , Purple , Azure , or spect with Gold ,</l>
     <l n="430">Hung drooping unsustaind , them she upstaies 430</l>
     <l n="431">Gently with Mirtle band , mindless the while ,</l>
     <l n="432">Her self , though fairest unsupported Flour ,</l>
     <l n="433">From her best prop so farr , and storm so nigh .</l>
     <l n="434">Neerer he drew , and many a walk travers 'd</l>
     <l n="435">Of stateliest Covert , Cedar , Pine , or Palme ,</l>
     <l n="436">Then voluble and bold , now hid , now seen</l>
     <l n="437">Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours</l>
     <l n="438">Imborderd on each Bank , the hand of Eve :</l>
     <l n="439">Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign 'd</l>
     <l n="440">Or of reviv 'd Adonis , or renownd 440</l>
     <l n="441">Alcinous , host of old Laertes Son ,</l>
     <l n="442">Or that , not Mystic , where the Sapient King</l>
     <l n="443">Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse .</l>
     <l n="444">Much hee the Place admir 'd , the Person more .</l>
     <l n="445">As one who long in populous City pent ,</l>
     <l n="446">Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire ,</l>
     <l n="447">Forth issuing on a Summers Morn , to breathe</l>
     <l n="448">Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes</l>
     <l n="449">Adjoynd , from each thing met conceaves delight ,</l>
     <l n="450">The smell of Grain , or tedded Grass , or Kine , 450</l>
     <l n="451">Or Dairie , each rural sight , each rural sound ;</l>
     <l n="452">If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass ,</l>
     <l n="453">What pleasing seemd , for her now pleases more ,</l>
     <l n="454">She most , and in her look summs all Delight .</l>
     <l n="455">Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold</l>
     <l n="456">This Flourie Plat , the sweet recess of Eve</l>
     <l n="457">Thus earlie , thus alone ; her Heav'nly forme</l>
     <l n="458">Angelic , but more soft , and Feminine ,</l>
     <l n="459">Her graceful Innocence , her every Aire</l>
     <l n="460">Of gesture or lest action overawd 460</l>
     <l n="461">His Malice , and with rapine sweet bereav 'd</l>
     <l n="462">His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought :</l>
     <l n="463">That space the Evil one abstracted stood</l>
     <l n="464">From his own evil , and for the time remaind</l>
     <l n="465">Stupidly good , of enmitie disarm 'd ,</l>
     <l n="466">Of guile , of hate , of envie , of revenge ;</l>
     <l n="467">But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes ,</l>
     <l n="468">Though in mid Heav'n , soon ended his delight ,</l>
     <l n="469">And tortures him now more , the more he sees</l>
     <l n="470">Of pleasure not for him ordain 'd : then soon 470</l>
     <l n="471">Fierce hate he recollects , and all his thoughts</l>
     <l n="472">Of mischief , gratulating , thus excites .</l>
     <l n="473">Thoughts , whither have he led me , with what sweet</l>
     <l n="474">Compulsion thus transported to forget</l>
     <l n="475">What hither brought us , hate , not love , nor hope</l>
     <l n="476">Of Paradise for Hell , hope here to taste</l>
     <l n="477">Of pleasure , but all pleasure to destroy ,</l>
     <l n="478">Save what is in destroying , other joy</l>
     <l n="479">To me is lost . Then let me not let pass</l>
     <l n="480">Occasion which now smiles , behold alone 480</l>
     <l n="481">The Woman , opportune to all attempts ,</l>
     <l n="482">Her Husband , for I view far round , not nigh ,</l>
     <l n="483">Whose higher intellectual more I shun ,</l>
     <l n="484">And strength , of courage hautie , and of limb</l>
     <l n="485">Heroic built , though of terrestrial mould ,</l>
     <l n="486">Foe not informidable , exempt from wound ,</l>
     <l n="487">I not ; so much hath Hell debas 'd , and paine</l>
     <l n="488">Infeebl 'd me , to what I was in Heav'n .</l>
     <l n="489">Shee fair , divinely fair , fit Love for Gods ,</l>
     <l n="490">Not terrible , though terrour be in Love 490</l>
     <l n="491">And beautie , not approacht by stronger hate ,</l>
     <l n="492">Hate stronger , under shew of Love well feign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="493">The way which to her ruin now I tend .</l>
     <l n="494">So spake the Enemie of Mankind , enclos 'd</l>
     <l n="495">In Serpent , Inmate bad , and toward Eve</l>
     <l n="496">Address 'd his way , not with indented wave ,</l>
     <l n="497">Prone on the ground , as since , but on his reare ,</l>
     <l n="498">Circular base of rising foulds , that tour 'd</l>
     <l n="499">Fould above fould a surging Maze , his Head</l>
     <l n="500">Crested aloft , and Carbuncle his Eyes ; 500</l>
     <l n="501">With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold , erect</l>
     <l n="502">Amidst his circling Spires , that on the grass</l>
     <l n="503">Floted redundant : pleasing was his shape ,</l>
     <l n="504">And lovely , never since of Serpent kind</l>
     <l n="505">Lovelier , not those that in Illyria chang 'd</l>
     <l n="506">Hermione and Cadmus , or the God</l>
     <l n="507">In Epidaurus ; nor to which transformd</l>
     <l n="508">Ammonian Jove , or Capitoline was seen ,</l>
     <l n="509">Hee with Olympias , this with her who bore</l>
     <l n="510">Scipio the highth of Rome . With tract oblique 510</l>
     <l n="511">At first , as one who sought access , but feard</l>
     <l n="512">To interrupt , side-long he works his way .</l>
     <l n="513">As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought</l>
     <l n="514">Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland , where the Wind</l>
     <l n="515">Veres oft , as oft so steers , and shifts her Saile ;</l>
     <l n="516">So varied hee , and of his tortuous Traine</l>
     <l n="517">Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve ,</l>
     <l n="518">To lure her Eye ; shee busied heard the sound</l>
     <l n="519">Of rusling Leaves , but minded not , as us 'd</l>
     <l n="520">To such disport before her through the Field , 520</l>
     <l n="521">From every Beast , more duteous at her call ,</l>
     <l n="522">Then at Circean call the Herd disguis 'd .</l>
     <l n="523">Hee boulder now , uncall 'd before her stood ;</l>
     <l n="524">But as in gaze admiring : Oft he bowd</l>
     <l n="525">His turret Crest , and sleek enamel 'd Neck ,</l>
     <l n="526">Fawning , and lick 'd the ground whereon she trod .</l>
     <l n="527">His gentle dumb expression turnd at length</l>
     <l n="528">The Eye of Eve to mark his play ; he glad</l>
     <l n="529">Of her attention gaind , with Serpent Tongue</l>
     <l n="530">Organic , or impulse of vocal Air , 530</l>
     <l n="531">His fraudulent temptation thus began .</l>
     <l n="532">Wonder not , sovran Mistress , if perhaps</l>
     <l n="533">Thou canst , who art sole Wonder , much less arm</l>
     <l n="534">Thy looks , the Heav'n of mildness , with disdain ,</l>
     <l n="535">Displeas 'd that I approach thee thus , and gaze</l>
     <l n="536">Insatiate , I thus single ; nor have feard</l>
     <l n="537">Thy awful brow , more awful thus retir 'd .</l>
     <l n="538">Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire ,</l>
     <l n="539">Thee all living things gaze on , all things thine</l>
     <l n="540">By gift , and thy Celestial Beautie adore 540</l>
     <l n="541">With ravishment beheld , there best beheld</l>
     <l n="542">Where universally admir 'd ; but here</l>
     <l n="543">In this enclosure wild , these Beasts among ,</l>
     <l n="544">Beholders rude , and shallow to discerne</l>
     <l n="545">Half what in thee is fair , one man except ,</l>
     <l n="546">Who sees thee ? ( and what is one ? ) who shouldst be seen</l>
     <l n="547">A Goddess among Gods , ador 'd and serv 'd</l>
     <l n="548">By Angels numberless , thy daily Train .</l>
     <l n="549">So gloz 'd the Tempter , and his Proem tun 'd ;</l>
     <l n="550">Into the Heart of Eve his words made way , 550</l>
     <l n="551">Though at the voice much marveling ; at length</l>
     <l n="552">Not unamaz 'd she thus in answer spake .</l>
     <l n="553">What may this mean ? Language of Man pronounc't</l>
     <l n="554">By Tongue of Brute , and human sense exprest ?</l>
     <l n="555">The first at lest of these I thought deni 'd</l>
     <l n="556">To Beasts , whom God on their Creation-Day</l>
     <l n="557">Created mute to all articulat sound ;</l>
     <l n="558">The latter I demurre , for in thir looks</l>
     <l n="559">Much reason , and in thir actions oft appeers .</l>
     <l n="560">Thee , Serpent , suttlest beast of all the field 560</l>
     <l n="561">I knew , but not with human voice endu 'd ;</l>
     <l n="562">Redouble then this miracle , and say ,</l>
     <l n="563">How cam'st thou speakable of mute , and how</l>
     <l n="564">To me so friendly grown above the rest</l>
     <l n="565">Of brutal kind , that daily are in sight ?</l>
     <l n="566">Say , for such wonder claims attention due .</l>
     <l n="567">To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply 'd .</l>
     <l n="568">Empress of this fair World , resplendent Eve ,</l>
     <l n="569">Easie to mee it is to tell thee all</l>
     <l n="570">What thou commandst , and right thou shouldst be obeyd : 570</l>
     <l n="571">I was at first as other Beasts that graze</l>
     <l n="572">The trodden Herb , of abject thoughts and low ,</l>
     <l n="573">As was my food , nor aught but food discern 'd</l>
     <l n="574">Or Sex , and apprehended nothing high :</l>
     <l n="575">Till on a day roaving the field , I chanc 'd</l>
     <l n="576">A goodly Tree farr distant to behold</l>
     <l n="577">Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt ,</l>
     <l n="578">Ruddie and Gold : I nearer drew to gaze ;</l>
     <l n="579">When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n ,</l>
     <l n="580">Grateful to appetite , more pleas 'd my sense 580</l>
     <l n="581">Then smell of sweetest Fenel , or the Teats</l>
     <l n="582">Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn ,</l>
     <l n="583">Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid , that tend thir play .</l>
     <l n="584">To satisfie the sharp desire I had</l>
     <l n="585">Of tasting those fair Apples , I resolv 'd</l>
     <l n="586">Not to deferr ; hunger and thirst at once ,</l>
     <l n="587">Powerful perswaders , quick'nd at the scent</l>
     <l n="588">Of that alluring fruit , urg 'd me so keene .</l>
     <l n="589">About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon ,</l>
     <l n="590">For high from ground the branches would require 590</l>
     <l n="591">Thy utmost reach or Adams : Round the Tree</l>
     <l n="592">All other Beasts that saw , with like desire</l>
     <l n="593">Longing and envying stood , but could not reach .</l>
     <l n="594">Amid the Tree now got , where plentie hung</l>
     <l n="595">Tempting so nigh , to pluck and eat my fill</l>
     <l n="596">I spar 'd not , for such pleasure till that hour</l>
     <l n="597">At Feed or Fountain never had I found .</l>
     <l n="598">Sated at length , ere long I might perceave</l>
     <l n="599">Strange alteration in me , to degree</l>
     <l n="600">Of Reason in my inward Powers , and Speech 600</l>
     <l n="601">Wanted not long , though to this shape retaind .</l>
     <l n="602">Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep</l>
     <l n="603">I turnd my thoughts , and with capacious mind</l>

     <l n="618">For many are the Trees of God that grow</l>
     <l n="619">In Paradise , and various , yet unknown</l>
     <l n="620">To us , in such abundance lies our choice , 620</l>
     <l n="621">As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht ,</l>

     <l n="751">Conceales not from us , naming thee the Tree</l>
     <l n="752">Of Knowledge , knowledge both of good and evil ;</l>
     <l n="753">Forbids us then to taste , but his forbidding</l>
     <l n="754">Commends thee more , while it inferrs the good</l>
     <l n="755">By thee communicated , and our want :</l>
     <l n="756">For good unknown , sure is not had , or had</l>
     <l n="757">And yet unknown , is as not had at all .</l>
     <l n="758">In plain then , what forbids he but to know ,</l>
     <l n="759">Forbids us good , forbids us to be wise ?</l>
     <l n="760">Such prohibitions binde not . But if Death 760</l>

     <l n="762">Our inward freedom ? In the day we eate</l>
     <l n="763">Of this fair Fruit , our doom is , we shall die .</l>
     <l n="764">How dies the Serpent ? hee hath eat'n and lives ,</l>

     <l n="768">This intellectual food , for beasts reserv 'd ?</l>
     <l n="769">For Beasts it seems : yet that one Beast which first</l>
     <l n="770">Hath tasted , envies not , but brings with joy 770</l>
     <l n="771">The good befall'n him , Author unsuspect ,</l>
     <l n="772">Friendly to man , farr from deceit or guile .</l>

     <l n="774">Under this ignorance of Good and Evil ,</l>
     <l n="775">Of God or Death , of Law or Penaltie ?</l>
     <l n="776">Here grows the Cure of all , this Fruit Divine ,</l>
     <l n="777">Fair to the Eye , inviting to the Taste ,</l>
     <l n="778">Of vertue to make wise : what hinders then</l>
     <l n="779">To reach , and feed at once both Bodie and Mind ?</l>
     <l n="780">So saying , her rash hand in evil hour 780</l>
     <l n="781">Forth reaching to the Fruit , she pluck 'd , she eat :</l>
     <l n="782">Earth felt the wound , and Nature from her seat</l>

     <l n="786">Intent now wholly on her taste , naught else</l>
     <l n="787">Regarded , such delight till then , as seemd ,</l>
     <l n="788">In Fruit she never tasted , whether true</l>
     <l n="789">Or fansied so , through expectation high</l>
     <l n="790">Of knowledg , nor was God-head from her thought . 790</l>
     <l n="791">Greedily she ingorg 'd without restraint ,</l>
     <l n="792">And knew not eating Death : Satiate at length ,</l>
     <l n="793">And hight'nd as with Wine , jocond and boon ,</l>
     <l n="794">Thus to her self she pleasingly began .</l>
     <l n="795">O Sovran , vertuous , precious of all Trees</l>
     <l n="796">In Paradise , of operation blest</l>
     <l n="797">To Sapience , hitherto obscur 'd , infam 'd ,</l>

     <l n="802">Of thy full branches offer 'd free to all ;</l>
     <l n="803">Till dieted by thee I grow mature</l>
     <l n="804">In knowledge , as the Gods who all things know ;</l>
     <l n="805">Though others envie what they cannot give ;</l>
     <l n="806">For had the gift bin theirs , it had not here</l>
     <l n="807">Thus grown . Experience , next to thee I owe ,</l>
     <l n="808">Best guide ; not following thee , I had remaind</l>
     <l n="809">In ignorance , thou op'nst Wisdoms way ,</l>
     <l n="810">And giv'st access , though secret she retire . 810</l>
     <l n="811">And I perhaps am secret ; Heav'n is high ,</l>
     <l n="812">High and remote to see from thence distinct</l>
     <l n="813">Each thing on Earth ; and other care perhaps</l>
     <l n="814">May have diverted from continual watch</l>
     <l n="815">Our great Forbidder , safe with all his Spies</l>
     <l n="816">About him . But to Adam in what sort</l>
     <l n="817">Shall I appeer ? shall I to him make known</l>
     <l n="818">As yet my change , and give him to partake</l>
     <l n="819">Full happiness with mee , or rather not ,</l>
     <l n="820">But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power 820</l>
     <l n="821">Without Copartner ? so to add what wants</l>
     <l n="822">In Femal Sex , the more to draw his Love ,</l>
     <l n="823">And render me more equal , and perhaps</l>
     <l n="824">A thing not undesireable , somtime</l>
     <l n="825">Superior ; for inferior who is free ?</l>
     <l n="826">This may be well : but what if God have seen ,</l>
     <l n="827">And Death ensue ? then I shall be no more ,</l>
     <l n="828">And Adam wedded to another Eve ,</l>
     <l n="829">Shall live with her enjoying , I extinct ;</l>
     <l n="830">A death to think . Confirm 'd then I resolve , 830</l>
     <l n="831">Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe :</l>
     <l n="832">So dear I love him , that with him all deaths</l>
     <l n="833">I could endure ; without him live no life .</l>
     <l n="834">So saying , from the Tree her step she turnd ,</l>
     <l n="835">But first low Reverence don , as to the power</l>
     <l n="836">That dwelt within , whose presence had infus 'd</l>

     <l n="838">From Nectar , drink of Gods . Adam the while</l>

     <l n="841">Her Tresses , and her rural labours crown</l>
     <l n="842">As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen .</l>

     <l n="845">Yet oft his heart , divine of somthing ill ,</l>
     <l n="846">Misgave him ; hee the faultring measure felt ;</l>
     <l n="847">And forth to meet her went , the way she took</l>
     <l n="848">That Morn when first they parted ; by the Tree</l>
     <l n="849">Of Knowledge he must pass , there he her met ,</l>
     <l n="850">Scarse from the Tree returning ; in her hand 850</l>

     <l n="861">The paine of absence from thy sight . But strange</l>
     <l n="862">Hath bin the cause , and wonderful to heare :</l>
     <l n="863">This Tree is not as we are told , a Tree</l>
     <l n="864">Of danger tasted , nor to evil unknown</l>
     <l n="865">Op'ning the way , but of Divine effect</l>
     <l n="866">To open Eyes , and make them Gods who taste ;</l>
     <l n="867">And hath bin tasted such ; the Serpent wise ,</l>
     <l n="868">Or not restraind as wee , or not obeying ,</l>
     <l n="869">Hath eat'n of the fruit , and is become ,</l>
     <l n="870">Not dead , as we are threatn 'd , but thenceforth 870</l>
     <l n="871">Endu 'd with human voice and human sense ,</l>

     <l n="878">Chiefly I sought , without thee can despise .</l>
     <l n="879">For bliss , as thou hast part , to me is bliss ,</l>
     <l n="880">Tedious , unshar 'd with thee , and odious soon . 880</l>
     <l n="881">Thou therefore also taste , that equal Lot</l>

     <l n="1036">Of Eve , whose Eye darted contagious Fire .</l>
     <l n="1037">Her hand he seis 'd , and to a shadie bank ,</l>
     <l n="1038">Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr 'd</l>
     <l n="1039">He led her nothing loath ; Flours were the Couch ,</l>
     <l n="1040">Pansies , and Violets , and Asphodel , 1040</l>
     <l n="1041">And Hyacinth , Earths freshest softest lap .</l>
     <l n="1042">There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport</l>
     <l n="1043">Took largely , of thir mutual guilt the Seale ,</l>
     <l n="1044">The solace of thir sin , till dewie sleep</l>
     <l n="1045">Oppress 'd them , wearied with thir amorous play .</l>
     <l n="1046">Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit ,</l>

     <l n="1048">About thir spirits had plaid , and inmost powers</l>
     <l n="1049">Made erre , was now exhal 'd , and grosser sleep</l>
     <l n="1050">Bred of unkindly fumes , with conscious dreams 1050</l>
     <l n="1051">Encumberd , now had left them , up they rose</l>
     <l n="1052">As from unrest , and each the other viewing ,</l>
     <l n="1053">Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd , and thir minds</l>
     <l n="1054">How dark'nd ; innocence , that as a veile</l>
     <l n="1055">Had shadow 'd them from knowing ill , was gon ,</l>
     <l n="1056">Just confidence , and native righteousness ,</l>

     <l n="1058">To guiltie shame hee cover 'd , but his Robe</l>
     <l n="1059">Uncover 'd more . So rose the Danite strong</l>

     <l n="1064">Confounded long they sate , as struck'n mute ,</l>
     <l n="1065">Till Adam , though not less then Eve abasht ,</l>
     <l n="1066">At length gave utterance to these words constraind .</l>
     <l n="1067">O Eve , in evil hour thou didst give care</l>
     <l n="1068">To that false Worm , of whomsoever taught</l>
     <l n="1069">To counterfet Mans voice , true in our Fall ,</l>
     <l n="1070">False in our promis 'd Rising ; since our Eyes 1070</l>

     <l n="1073">Bad Fruit of Knowledge , if this be to know ,</l>

     <l n="1080">Be sure then . How shall I behold the face 1080</l>
     <l n="1081">Henceforth of God or Angel , earst with joy</l>

     <l n="1083">Will dazle now this earthly , with thir blaze</l>
     <l n="1084">Insufferably bright . O might I here</l>
     <l n="1085">In solitude live savage , in some glad</l>

     <l n="1091">But let us now , as in bad plight , devise</l>
     <l n="1092">What best may for the present serve to hide</l>
     <l n="1093">The Parts of each from other , that seem most</l>
     <l n="1094">To shame obnoxious , and unseemliest seen ,</l>
     <l n="1095">Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd ,</l>
     <l n="1096">And girded on our loyns , may cover round</l>
     <l n="1097">Those middle parts , that this new commer , Shame ,</l>

     <l n="1099">So counsel 'd hee , and both together went</l>
     <l n="1100">Into the thickest Wood , there soon they chose 1100</l>
     <l n="1101">The Figtree , not that kind for Fruit renown 'd ,</l>

Mans transgression known , the Guardian Angels forsake Paradise , and return up to Heaven to approve thir vigilance , and are approv 'd , God declaring that The entrance of Satan could not be by them prevented . He sends his Son to judge the Transgressors , who descends and gives Sentence accordingly ; then in pity cloaths them both , and reascends . Sin and Death sitting till then at the Gates of Hell by wondrous sympathie feeling the success of Satan in this new World , and the sin by Man there committed , resolve to sit no longer confin 'd in Hell , but to follow Satan thir Sire up to the place of Man : To make the way easier from Hell to this World to and fro , they pave a broad Highway or Bridge over Chaos , according to the Track that Satan first made ; then preparing for Earth , they meet him proud of his success returning to Hell ; thir mutual gratulation . Satan arrives at Pandemonium , in full assembly relates with boasting his success against Man ; instead of applause is entertained with a general hiss by all his audience , transform 'd with himself also suddenly into Serpents , according to his doom giv'n in Paradise ; then deluded with a shew of the forbidden Tree springing up before them , they greedily reaching to take of the Fruit , chew dust and bitter ashes. The proceedings of Sin and Death ; God foretels the final Victory of his Son over them , and the renewing of all things ; but for the present commands his Angels to make several alterations in the Heavens and Elements . Adam more and more perceiving his fall'n condition heavily bewailes , rejects the condolement of Eve ; she persists and at length appeases him : then to evade the Curse likely to fall on thir Ofspring , proposes to Adam violent wayes , which he approves not , but conceiving better hope , puts her in mind of the late Promise made them , that her Seed should be reveng 'd on the Serpent , and exhorts her with him to seek Peace of the offended Deity , by repentance and supplication . Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act Of Satan done in Paradise , and how Hee in the Serpent had perverted Eve , Her Husband shee , to taste the fatall fruit , Was known in Heav'n ; for what can scape the Eye Of God All-seeing , or deceave his Heart Omniscient , who in all things wise and just , Hinder 'd not Satan to attempt the minde Of Man , with strength entire , and free Will arm 'd , Complete to have discover 'd and repulst 10 Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend . For still they knew , and ought to have still remember 'd The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit , Whoever tempted ; which they not obeying , Incurr 'd , what could they less , the penaltie , And manifold in sin , deserv 'd to fall . Up into Heav'n from Paradise in hast Th ’ Angelic Guards ascended , mute and sad For Man , for of his state by this they knew , Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln 20 Entrance unseen . Soon as th ’ unwelcome news From Earth arriv 'd at Heaven Gate , displeas 'd All were who heard , dim sadness did not spare That time Celestial visages , yet mixt With pitie , violated not thir bliss . About the new-arriv 'd , in multitudes Th ’ ethereal People ran , to hear and know How all befell : they towards the Throne Supream Accountable made haste to make appear With righteous plea , thir utmost vigilance , 30 And easily approv 'd ; when the most High Eternal Father from his secret Cloud , Amidst in Thunder utter 'd thus his voice . Assembl 'd Angels , and ye Powers return 'd From unsuccessful charge , be not dismaid , Nor troubl 'd at these tidings from the Earth , Which your sincerest care could not prevent , Foretold so lately what would come to pass , When first this Tempter cross 'd the Gulf from Hell . I told ye then he should prevail and speed 40 On his bad Errand , Man should be seduc't And flatter 'd out of all , believing lies Against his Maker ; no Decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his Fall , Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free Will , to her own inclining left In eevn scale . But fall'n he is , and now What rests , but that the mortal Sentence pass On his transgression , Death denounc't that day , Which he presumes already vain and void , 50 Because not yet inflicted , as he fear 'd , By some immediate stroak ; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance ere day end . Justice shall not return as bountie scorn 'd . But whom send I to judge them ? whom but thee Vicegerent Son , to thee I have transferr 'd All Judgement , whether in Heav'n , or Earth ; or Hell . Easie it may be seen that I intend Mercie collegue with Justice , sending thee Mans Friend , his Mediator , his design 'd 60 Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie , And destin 'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n . So spake the Father , and unfoulding bright Toward the right hand his Glorie , on the Son Blaz 'd forth unclouded Deitie ; he full Resplendent all his Father manifest Express 'd , and thus divinely answer 'd milde . Father Eternal , thine is to decree , Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will Supream , that thou in mee thy Son belov 'd 70 Mayst ever rest well pleas 'd . I go to judge On Earth these thy transgressors , but thou knowst , Whoever judg 'd , the worst on mee must light , When time shall be , for so I undertook Before thee ; and not repenting , this obtaine Of right , that I may mitigate thir doom On me deriv 'd , yet I shall temper so Justice with Mercie , as may illustrate most Them fully satisfied , and thee appease . Attendance none shall need , nor Train , where none 80 Are to behold the Judgement , but the judg 'd , Those two ; the third best absent is condemn 'd , Convict by flight , and Rebel to all Law Conviction to the Serpent none belongs . Thus saying , from his radiant Seat he rose Of high collateral glorie : him Thrones and Powers , Princedoms , and Dominations ministrant Accompanied to Heaven Gate , from whence Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay . Down he descended strait ; the speed of Gods 90 Time counts not , though with swiftest minutes wing 'd . Now was the Sun in Western cadence low From Noon , and gentle Aires due at thir hour To fan the Earth now wak 'd , and usher in The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both To sentence Man : the voice of God they heard Now walking in the Garden , by soft windes Brought to thir Ears , while day declin 'd , they heard And from his presence hid themselves among 100 The thickest Trees , both Man and Wife , till God Approaching , thus to Adam call 'd aloud . Where art thou Adam , wont with joy to meet My coming seen far off ? I miss thee here , Not pleas 'd , thus entertaind with solitude , Where obvious dutie erewhile appear 'd unsaught : Or come I less conspicuous , or what change Absents thee , or what chance detains ? Come forth . He came , and with him Eve , more loth , though first To offend , discount'nanc ' t both , and discompos 'd ; 110 Love was not in thir looks , either to God Or to each other , but apparent guilt , And shame , and perturbation , and despaire , Anger , and obstinacie , and hate , and guile . Whence Adam faultring long , thus answer 'd brief . I heard thee in the Garden , and of thy voice Affraid , being naked , hid my self . To whom The gracious Judge without revile repli 'd . My voice thou oft hast heard , and hast not fear 'd , But still rejoyc't , how is it now become 120 So dreadful to thee ? that thou art naked , who Hath told thee ? hast thou eaten of the Tree Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat ? To whom thus Adam sore beset repli 'd . O Heav'n ! in evil strait this day I stand Before my Judge , either to undergoe My self the total Crime , or to accuse My other self , the partner of my life ; Whose failing , while her Faith to me remaines , I should conceal , and not expose to blame 130 By my complaint ; but strict necessitie Subdues me , and calamitous constraint , Least on my head both sin and punishment , However insupportable , be all Devolv 'd ; though should I hold my peace , yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceale . This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help , And gav'st me as thy perfet gift , so good , So fit , so acceptable , so Divine , That from her hand I could suspect no ill , 140 And what she did , whatever in it self , Her doing seem 'd to justifie the deed ; Shee gave me of the Tree , and I did eate . To whom the sovran Presence thus repli 'd . Was shee thy God , that her thou didst obey Before his voice , or was shee made thy guide , Superior , or but equal , that to her Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood , and the Place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee , And for thee , whose perfection farr excell 'd 150 Hers in all real dignitie : Adornd She was indeed , and lovely to attract Thy Love , not thy Subjection , and her Gifts Were such as under Government well seem 'd , Unseemly to beare rule , which was thy part And person , had'st thou known thy self aright . So having said , he thus to Eve in few : Say Woman , what is this which thou hast done ? To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm 'd , Confessing soon , yet not before her Judge 160 Bold or loquacious , thus abasht repli 'd . The Serpent me beguil 'd and I did eate . Which when the Lord God heard , without delay To Judgement he proceeded on th ’ accus 'd Serpent though brute , unable to transferre The Guilt on him who made him instrument Of mischief , and polluted from the end Of his Creation ; justly then accurst , As vitiated in Nature : more to know Concern 'd not Man ( since he no further knew ) 170 Nor alter 'd his offence ; yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom apply 'd , Though in mysterious terms , judg 'd as then best : And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall . Because thou hast done this , thou art accurst Above all Cattel , each Beast of the Field ; Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe , And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life . Between Thee and the Woman I will put Enmitie , and between thine and her Seed ; 180 Her Seed shall bruise thy head , thou bruise his heel . So spake this Oracle , then verifi 'd When Jesus son of Mary second Eve , Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n , Prince of the Aire ; then rising from his Grave Spoild Principalities and Powers , triumpht In open shew , and with ascention bright Captivity led captive through the Aire , The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt , Whom he shall tread at last under our feet ; 190 Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise , And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn 'd . Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie By thy Conception ; Children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth , and to thy Husbands will Thine shall submit , hee over thee shall rule . On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc 'd . Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife , And eaten of the Tree concerning which I charg 'd thee , saying : Thou shalt not eate thereof , 200 Curs 'd is the ground for thy sake , thou in sorrow Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life ; Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth Unbid , and thou shalt eate th ’ Herb of th ’ Field , In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread , Till thou return unto the ground , for thou Out of the ground wast taken , know thy Birth , For dust thou art , and shalt to dust returne . So judg 'd he Man , both Judge and Saviour sent , And th ’ instant stroke of Death denounc't that day 210 Remov 'd farr off ; then pittying how they stood Before him naked to the aire , that now Must suffer change , disdain 'd not to begin Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume , As when he wash 'd his servants feet , so now As Father of his Familie he clad Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts , or slain , Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid ; And thought not much to cloath his Enemies : Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins 220 Of Beasts , but inward nakedness , much more Opprobrious , with his Robe of righteousness , Araying cover 'd from his Fathers sight . To him with swift ascent he up returnd , Into his blissful bosom reassum 'd In glory as of old , to him appeas 'd All , though all-knowing , what had past with Man Recounted , mixing intercession sweet . Meanwhile ere thus was sin 'd and judg 'd on Earth , Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death , 230 In counterview within the Gates , that now Stood open wide , belching outrageous flame Farr into Chaos , since the Fiend pass 'd through , Sin opening , who thus now to Death began . O Son , why sit we here each other viewing Idlely , while Satan our great Author thrives In other Worlds , and happier Seat provides For us his ofspring deare ? It cannot be But that success attends him ; if mishap , Ere this he had return 'd , with fury driv'n 240 By his Avenger , since no place like this Can fit his punishment , or their revenge . Methinks I feel new strength within me rise , Wings growing , and Dominion giv'n me large Beyond this Deep ; whatever drawes me on , Or sympathie , or som connatural force Powerful at greatest distance to unite With secret amity things of like kinde By secretest conveyance . Thou my Shade Inseparable must with mee along : 250 For Death from Sin no power can separate . But least the difficultie of passing back Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe Impassable , impervious , let us try Adventrous work , yet to thy power and mine Not unagreeable , to found a path Over this Maine from Hell to that new World Where Satan now prevailes , a Monument Of merit high to all th ’ infernal Host , Easing thir passage hence , for intercourse , 260 Or transmigration , as thir lot shall lead . Nor can I miss the way , so strongly drawn By this new felt attraction and instinct . Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon . Goe whither Fate and inclination strong Leads thee , I shall not lag behinde , nor erre The way , thou leading , such a sent I draw Of carnage , prey innumerable , and taste The savour of Death from all things there that live : Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest 270 Be wanting , but afford thee equal aid . So saying , with delight he snuff 'd the smell Of mortal change on Earth . As when a flock Of ravenous Fowl , though many a League remote , Against the day of Battel , to a Field , Where Armies lie encampt , come flying , lur 'd With sent of living Carcasses design 'd For death , the following day , in bloodie fight . So sented the grim Feature , and upturn 'd His Nostril wide into the murkie Air , 280 Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr . Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark Flew divers , &amp; with Power ( thir Power was great ) Hovering upon the Waters ; what they met Solid or slimie , as in raging Sea Tost up and down , together crowded drove From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell . As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse Upon the Cronian Sea , together drive 290 Mountains of Ice , that stop th ’ imagin 'd way Beyond Petsora Eastward , to the rich Cathaian Coast . The aggregated Soyle Death with his Mace petrific , cold and dry , As with a Trident smote , and fix't as firm As Delos floating once ; the rest his look Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move , And with Asphaltic slime ; broad as the Gate , Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather 'd beach They fasten 'd , and the Mole immense wraught on 300 Over the foaming deep high Archt , a Bridge Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall Immoveable of this now fenceless world Forfeit to Death ; from hence a passage broad , Smooth , easie , inoffensive down to Hell . So , if great things to small may be compar 'd , Xerxes , the Libertie of Greece to yoke , From Susa his Memnonian Palace high Came to the Sea , and over Hellespont Bridging his way , Europe with Asia joyn 'd , 310 And scourg 'd with many a stroak th ’ indignant waves . Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art Pontifical , a ridge of pendent Rock Over the vext Abyss , following the track Of Satan , to the selfsame place where hee First lighted from his Wing , and landed safe From out of Chaos to the outside bare Of this round World : with Pinns of Adamant And Chains they made all fast , too fast they made And durable ; and now in little space 320 The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n And of this World , and on the left hand Hell With long reach interpos 'd ; three sev'ral wayes In sight , to each of these three places led . And now thir way to Earth they had descri 'd , To Paradise first tending , when behold Satan in likeness of an Angel bright Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing His Zenith , while the Sun in Aries rose : Disguis 'd he came , but those his Children dear 330 Thir Parent soon discern 'd , though in disguise . Hee , after Eve seduc't , unminded slunk Into the Wood fast by , and changing shape To observe the sequel , saw his guileful act By Eve , though all unweeting , seconded Upon her Husband , saw thir shame that sought Vain covertures ; but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them , terrifi 'd Hee fled , not hoping to escape , but shun The present , fearing guiltie what his wrauth 340 Might suddenly inflict ; that past , return 'd By Night , and listning where the hapless Paire Sate in thir sad discourse , and various plaint , Thence gatherd his own doom , which understood Not instant , but of future time . With joy And tidings fraught , to Hell he now return 'd , And at the brink of Chaos , neer the foot Of this new wondrous Pontifice , unhop't Met who to meet him came , his Ofspring dear . Great joy was at thir meeting , and at sight 350 Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas 'd . Long hee admiring stood , till Sin , his faire Inchanting Daughter , thus the silence broke . O Parent , these are thy magnific deeds , Thy Trophies , which thou view'st as not thine own , Thou art thir Author and prime Architect : For I no sooner in my Heart divin 'd , My Heart , which by a secret harmonie Still moves with thine , joyn 'd in connexion sweet , That thou on Earth hadst prosper 'd , which thy looks 360 Now also evidence , but straight I felt Though distant from thee Worlds between , yet felt That I must after thee with this thy Son ; Such fatal consequence unites us three : Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds , Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure Detain from following thy illustrious track . Thou hast atchiev 'd our libertie , confin 'd Within Hell Gates till now , thou us impow'rd To fortifie thus farr , and overlay 370 With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss . Thine now is all this World , thy vertue hath won What thy hands builded not , thy Wisdom gain 'd With odds what Warr hath lost , and fully aveng 'd Our foile in Heav'n ; here thou shalt Monarch reign , There didst not ; there let him still Victor sway , As Battel hath adjudg 'd , from this new World Retiring , by his own doom alienated , And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide Of all things , parted by th ’ Empyreal bounds , 380 His Quadrature , from thy Orbicular World , Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne . Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad . Fair Daughter , and thou Son and Grandchild both , High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race Of Satan ( for I glorie in the name , Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King ) Amply have merited of me , of all Th ’ Infernal Empire , that so neer Heav'ns dore Triumphal with triumphal act have met , 390 Mine with this glorious Work , &amp; made one Realm Hell and this World , one Realm , one Continent Of easie thorough-fare . Therefore while I Descend through Darkness , on your Rode with ease To my associate Powers , them to acquaint With these successes , and with them rejoyce , You two this way , among those numerous Orbs All yours , right down to Paradise descend ; There dwell &amp; Reign in bliss , thence on the Earth Dominion exercise and in the Aire , 400 Chiefly on Man , sole Lord of all declar 'd , Him first make sure your thrall , and lastly kill . My Substitutes I send ye , and Create Plenipotent on Earth , of matchless might Issuing from mee : on your joynt vigor now My hold of this new Kingdom all depends , Through Sin to Death expos 'd by my exploit . If your joynt power prevaile , th ’ affaires of Hell No detriment need feare , goe and be strong . So saying he dismiss 'd them , they with speed 410 Thir course through thickest Constellations held Spreading thir bane ; the blasted Starrs lookt wan , And Planets , Planet-strook , real Eclips Then sufferd . Th ’ other way Satan went down The Causey to Hell Gate ; on either side Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd , And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild , That scorn 'd his indignation : through the Gate , Wide open and unguarded , Satan pass 'd , And all about found desolate ; for those 420 Appointed to sit there , had left thir charge , Flown to the upper World ; the rest were all Farr to the inland retir 'd , about the walls Of Pandemonium , Citie and proud seate Of Lucifer , so by allusion calld , Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond . There kept thir Watch the Legions , while the Grand In Council sate , sollicitous what chance Might intercept thir Emperour sent , so hee Departing gave command , and they observ 'd . 430 As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines Retires , or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes Of Turkish Crescent , leaves all waste beyond The Realme of Aladule , in his retreate To Tauris or Casbeen . So these the late Heav'nhYpppHeNbanisht Host , left desert utmost Hell Many a dark League , reduc't in careful Watch Round thir Metropolis , and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer from the search 440 Of Forrein Worlds : he through the midst unmarkt , In shew plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order , past ; and from the dore Of that Plutonian Hall , invisible Ascended his high Throne , which under state Of richest texture spred , at th ’ upper end Was plac't in regal lustre . Down a while He sate , and round about him saw unseen : At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head And shape Starr bright appeer 'd , or brighter , clad 450 With what permissive glory since his fall Was left him , or false glitter : All amaz 'd At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng Bent thir aspect , and whom they wish 'd beheld , Thir mighty Chief returnd : loud was th ’ acclaime : Forth rush 'd in haste the great consulting Peers , Rais 'd from thir dark Divan , and with like joy Congratulant approach 'd him , who with hand Silence , and with these words attention won . Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Vertues , Powers , 460 For in possession such , not onely of right , I call ye and declare ye now , returnd Successful beyond hope , to lead ye forth Triumphant out of this infernal Pit Abominable , accurst , the house of woe , And Dungeon of our Tyrant : Now possess , As Lords , a spacious World , to our native Heaven Little inferiour , by my adventure hard With peril great atchiev 'd . Long were to tell What I have don , what sufferd , with what paine 470 Voyag 'd the unreal , vast , unbounded deep Of horrible confusion , over which By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav 'd To expedite your glorious march ; but I Toild out my uncouth passage , forc't to ride Th ’ untractable Abysse , plung 'd in the womb Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde , That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos 'd My journey strange , with clamorous uproare Protesting Fate supreame ; thence how I found 480 The new created World , which fame in Heav'n Long had foretold , a Fabrick wonderful Of absolute perfection , therein Man Plac't in a Paradise , by our exile Made happie : Him by fraud I have seduc 'd From his Creator , and the more to increase Your wonder , with an Apple ; he thereat Offended , worth your laughter , hath giv'n up Both his beloved Man and all his World , To Sin and Death a prey , and so to us , 490 Without our hazard , labour or allarme , To range in , and to dwell , and over Man To rule , as over all he should have rul 'd . True is , mee also he hath judg 'd , or rather Mee not , but the brute Serpent in whose shape Man I deceav 'd : that which to mee belongs , Is enmity , which he will put between Mee and Mankinde ; I am to bruise his heel ; His Seed , when is not set , shall bruise my head : A World who would not purchase with a bruise , 500 Or much more grievous pain ? Ye have th ’ account Of my performance : What remaines , ye Gods , But up and enter now into full bliss . So having said , a while he stood , expecting Thir universal shout and high applause To fill his eare , when contrary he hears On all sides , from innumerable tongues A dismal universal hiss , the sound Of public scorn ; he wonderd , but not long Had leasure , wondring at himself now more ; 510 His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare , His Armes clung to his Ribs , his Leggs entwining Each other , till supplanted down he fell A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone , Reluctant , but in vaine , a greater power Now rul 'd him , punisht in the shape he sin 'd , According to his doom : he would have spoke , But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue To forked tongue , for now were all transform 'd Alike , to Serpents all as accessories 520 To his bold Riot : dreadful was the din Of hissing through the Hall , thick swarming now With complicated monsters , head and taile , Scorpion and Asp , and Amphisbaena dire , Cerastes hornd , Hydrus , and Ellops drear , And Dipsas ( Not so thick swarm 'd once the Soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon , or the Isle Ophiusa ) but still greatest hee the midst , Now Dragon grown , larger then whom the Sun Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime , 530 Huge Python , and his Power no less he seem 'd Above the rest still to retain ; they all Him follow 'd issuing forth to th ’ open Field , Where all yet left of that revolted Rout Heav'nhYpppHeNfall ' n , in station stood or just array , Sublime with expectation when to see In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief ; They saw , but other sight instead , a crowd Of ugly Serpents ; horror on them fell , And horrid sympathie ; for what they saw , 540 They felt themselvs now changing ; down thir arms , Down fell both Spear and Shield , down they as fast , And the dire hiss renew 'd , and the dire form Catcht by Contagion , like in punishment , As in thir crime . Thus was th ’ applause they meant , Turnd to exploding hiss , triumph to shame Cast on themselves from thir own mouths . There stood A Grove hard by , sprung up with this thir change , His will who reigns above , to aggravate Thir penance , laden with fair Fruit , like that 550 Which grew in Paradise , the bait of Eve Us 'd by the Tempter : on that prospect strange Thir earnest eyes they fix 'd , imagining For one forbidden Tree a multitude Now ris'n , to work them furder woe or shame ; Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce , Though to delude them sent , could not abstain , But on they rould in heaps , and up the Trees Climbing , sat thicker then the snakie locks That curld Megaera : greedily they pluck 'd 560 The Frutage fair to sight , like that which grew Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam 'd ; This more delusive , not the touch , but taste Deceav 'd ; they fondly thinking to allay Thir appetite with gust , instead of Fruit Chewd bitter Ashes , which th ’ offended taste With spattering noise rejected : oft they assayd , Hunger and thirst constraining , drugd as oft , With hatefullest disrelish writh 'd thir jaws With foot and cinders fill 'd ; so oft they fell 570 Into the same illusion , not as Man Whom they triumph 'd once lapst . Thus were they plagu 'd And worn with Famin , long and ceasless hiss , Till thir lost shape , permitted , they resum 'd , Yearly enjoynd , some say , to undergo This annual humbling certain number 'd days , To dash thir pride , and joy for Man seduc't . However some tradition they dispers 'd Among the Heathen of thir purchase got , And Fabl 'd how the Serpent , whom they calld 580 Ophion with Eurynome , the wide - Encroaching Eve perhaps , had first the rule Of high Olympus , thence by Saturn driv'n And Ops , ere yet Dictaean Jove was born . Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair Too soon arriv 'd , Sin there in power before , Once actual , now in body , and to dwell Habitual habitant ; behind her Death Close following pace for pace , not mounted yet On his pale Horse : to whom Sin thus began . 590 Second of Satan sprung , all conquering Death , What thinkst thou of our Empire now , though earnd With travail difficult , not better farr Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch , Unnam 'd , undreaded , and thy self half starv 'd ? Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon . To mee , who with eternal Famin pine , Alike is Hell , or Paradise , or Heaven , There best , where most with ravin I may meet ; Which here , though plenteous , all too little seems 600 To stuff this Maw , this vast unhide-bound Corps . To whom th ’ incestuous Mother thus repli 'd . Thou therefore on these Herbs , and Fruits , &amp; Flours Feed first , on each Beast next , and Fish , and Fowle , No homely morsels , and whatever thing The Sithe of Time mowes down , devour unspar 'd , Till I in Man residing through the Race , His thoughts , his looks , words , actions all infect , And season him thy last and sweetest prey . This said , they both betook them several wayes , 610 Both to destroy , or unimmortal make All kinds , and for destruction to mature Sooner or later ; which th ’ Almightie seeing , From his transcendent Seat the Saints among , To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice . See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance To waste and havoc yonder World , which I So fair and good created , and had still Kept in that state , had not the folly of Man Let in these wastful Furies , who impute 620 Folly to mee , so doth the Prince of Hell And his Adherents , that with so much ease I suffer them to enter and possess A place so heav'nly , and conniving seem To gratifie my scornful Enemies , That laugh , as if transported with some fit Of Passion , I to them had quitted all , At random yeilded up to their misrule ; And know not that I call 'd and drew them thither My Hell-hounds , to lick up the draff and filth 630 Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed On what was pure , till cramm 'd and gorg 'd , nigh burst With suckt and glutted offal , at one fling Of thy victorious Arm , well-pleasing Son , Both Sin , and Death , and yawning Grave at last Through Chaos hurld , obstruct the mouth of Hell For ever , and seal up his ravenous Jawes . Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure To sanctitie that shall receive no staine : Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes . 640 Hee ended , and the heav'nly Audience loud Sung Halleluia , as the sound of Seas , Through multitude that sung : Just are thy ways , Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works ; Who can extenuate thee ? Next , to the Son , Destin 'd restorer of Mankind , by whom New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise , Or down from Heav'n descend . Such was thir song , While the Creator calling forth by name His mightie Angels gave them several charge , 650 As sorted best with present things . The Sun Had first his precept so to move , so shine , As might affect the Earth with cold and heat Scarce tollerable , and from the North to call Decrepit Winter , from the South to bring Solstitial summers heat . To the blanc Moone Her office they prescrib 'd , to th ’ other five Thir planetarie motions and aspects In Sextile , Square , and Trine , and Opposite , Of noxious efficacie , and when to joyne 660 In Synod unbenigne , and taught the fixt Thir influence malignant when to showre , Which of them rising with the Sun , or falling , Should prove tempestuous : To the Winds they set Thir corners , when with bluster to confound Sea , Aire , and Shoar , the Thunder when to rowle With terror through the dark Aereal Hall . Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more From the Suns Axle ; they with labour push 'd 670 Oblique the Centric Globe : Som say the Sun Was bid turn Reines from th ’ Equinoctial Rode Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n Atlantick Sisters , and the Spartan Twins Up to the Tropic Crab ; thence down amaine By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales , As deep as Capricorne , to bring in change Of Seasons to each Clime ; else had the Spring Perpetual smil 'd on Earth with vernant Flours , Equal in Days and Nights , except to those 680 Beyond the Polar Circles ; to them Day Had unbenighted shon , while the low Sun To recompence his distance , in thir sight Had rounded still th ’ Horizon , and not known Or East or West , which had forbid the Snow From cold Estotiland , and South as farr Beneath Magellan . At that tasted Fruit The Sun , as from Thyestean Banquet , turn 'd His course intended ; else how had the World Inhabited , though sinless , more then now , 690 Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate ? These changes in the Heav'ns , though slow , produc 'd Like change on Sea and Land , sideral blast , Vapour , and Mist , and Exhalation hot , Corrupt and Pestilent : Now from the North Of Norumbega , and the Samoed shoar Bursting thir brazen Dungeon , armd with ice And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw , Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn ; 700 With adverse blast up-turns them from the South Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds From Serraliona ; thwart of these as fierce Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise , Sirocco , and Libecchio . Thus began Outrage from liveless things ; but Discord first Daughter of Sin , among th ’ irrational , Death introduc 'd through fierce antipathie : Beast now with Beast gan war , &amp; Fowle with Fowle , 710 And Fish with Fish ; to graze the Herb all leaving , Devourd each other ; nor stood much in awe Of Man , but fled him , or with count'nance grim Glar 'd on him passing : these were from without The growing miseries , which Adam saw Alreadie in part , though hid in gloomiest shade , To sorrow abandond , but worse felt within , And in a troubl 'd Sea of passion tost , Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint . O miserable of happie ! is this the end 720 Of this new glorious World , and mee so late The Glory of that Glory , who now becom Accurst of blessed , hide me from the face Of God , whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness : yet well , if here would end The miserie , I deserv 'd it , and would beare My own deservings ; but this will not serve ; All that I eate or drink , or shall beget , Is propagated curse . O voice once heard Delightfully , Encrease And Multiply , 730 Now death to heare ! for what can I encrease Or multiplie , but curses on my head ? Who of all Ages to succeed , but feeling The evil on him brought by me , will curse My Head , Ill fare our Ancestor impure , For this we may thank Adam ; but his thanks Shall be the execration ; so besides Mine own that bide upon me , all from mee Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound , On mee as on thir natural center light 740 Heavie , though in thir place . O fleeting joyes Of Paradise , deare bought with lasting woes ! Did I request thee , Maker , from my Clay To mould me Man , did I sollicite thee From darkness to promote me , or here place In this delicious Garden ? as my Will Concurd not to my being , it were but right And equal to reduce me to my dust , Desirous to resigne , and render back All I receav 'd , unable to performe 750 Thy terms too hard , by which I was to hold The good I sought not . To the loss of that , Sufficient penaltie , why hast thou added The sense of endless woes ? inexplicable Thy Justice seems ; yet to say truth , too late , I thus contest ; then should have been refusd Those terms whatever , when they were propos 'd : Thou didst accept them ; wilt thou enjoy the good , Then cavil the conditions ? and though God Made thee without thy leave , what if thy Son 760 Prove disobedient , and reprov 'd , retort , Wherefore didst thou beget me ? I sought it not : Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee That proud excuse ? yet him not thy election , But Natural necessity begot . God made thee of choice his own , and of his own To serve him , thy reward was of his grace , Thy punishment then justly is at his Will . Be it so , for I submit , his doom is fair , That dust I am , and shall to dust returne : 770 O welcom hour whenever ! why delayes His hand to execute what his Decree Fixd on this day ? why do I overlive , Why am I mockt with death , and length'nd out To deathless pain ? how gladly would I meet Mortalitie my sentence , and be Earth Insensible , how glad would lay me down As in my Mothers lap ? there I should rest And sleep secure ; his dreadful voice no more Would Thunder in my ears , no fear of worse 780 To mee and to my ofspring would torment me With cruel expectation . Yet one doubt Pursues me still , least all I cannot die , Least that pure breath of Life , the Spirit of Man Which God inspir 'd , cannot together perish With this corporeal Clod ; then in the Grave , Or in some other dismal place , who knows But I shall die a living Death ? O thought Horrid , if true ! yet why ? it was but breath Of Life that sinn 'd ; what dies but what had life 790 And sin ? the Bodie properly hath neither . All of me then shall die : let this appease The doubt , since humane reach no further knows . For though the Lord of all be infinite , Is his wrauth also ? be it , man is not so , But mortal doom 'd . How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end ? Can he make deathless Death ? that were to make Strange contradiction , which to God himself Impossible is held , as Argument 800 Of weakness , not of Power . Will he , draw out , For angers sake , finite to infinite In punisht man , to satisfie his rigour Satisfi 'd never ; that were to extend His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law , By which all Causes else according still To the reception of thir matter act , Not to th ’ extent of thir own Spheare . But say That Death be not one stroak , as I suppos 'd , Bereaving sense , but endless miserie 810 From this day onward , which I feel begun Both in me , and without me , and so last To perpetuitie ; Ay me , that fear Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution On my defensless head ; both Death and I Am found Eternal , and incorporate both , Nor I on my part single , in mee all Posteritie stands curst : Fair Patrimonie That I must leave ye , Sons ; O were I able To waste it all my self , and leave ye none ! 820 So disinherited how would ye bless Me now your Curse ! Ah , why should all mankind For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn 'd , If guiltless ? But from mee what can proceed , But all corrupt , both Mind and Will deprav 'd , Not to do onely , but to will the same With me ? how can they acquitted stand In sight of God ? Him after all Disputes Forc't I absolve : all my evasions vain And reasonings , though through Mazes , lead me still 830 But to my own conviction : first and last On mee , mee onely , as the sourse and spring Of all corruption , all the blame lights due ; So might the wrauth , Fond wish ! couldst thou support That burden heavier then the Earth to bear , Then all the world much heavier , though divided With that bad Woman ? Thus what thou desir'st , And what thou fearst , alike destroyes all hope Of refuge , and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future , 840 To Satan onely like both crime and doom . O Conscience , into what Abyss of fears And horrors hast thou driv'n me ; out of which I find no way , from deep to deeper plung 'd ! Thus Adam to himself lamented loud Through the still Night , now now , as ere man fell , Wholsom and cool , and mild , but with black Air Accompanied , with damps and dreadful gloom , Which to his evil Conscience represented All things with double terror : On the ground 850 Outstretcht he lay , on the cold ground , and oft Curs 'd his Creation , Death as oft accus 'd Of tardie execution , since denounc't The day of his offence . Why comes not Death , Said hee , with one thrice acceptable stroke To end me ? Shall Truth fail to keep her word , Justice Divine not hast'n to be just ? But Death comes not at call , Justice Divine Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries . O Woods , O Fountains , Hillocks , Dales and Bowrs , 860 With other echo farr I taught your Shades To answer , and resound farr other Song . Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld , Desolate where she sate , approaching nigh , Soft words to his fierce passion she assay 'd : But her with stern regard he thus repell 'd . Out of my sight , thou Serpent , that name best Befits thee with him leagu 'd , thy self as false And hateful ; nothing wants , but that thy shape , Like his , and colour Serpentine may shew 870 Thy inward fraud , to warn all Creatures from thee Henceforth ; least that too heav'nly form , pretended To hellish falshood , snare them . But for thee I had persisted happie , had not thy pride And wandring vanitie , when lest was safe , Rejected my forewarning , and disdain 'd Not to be trusted , longing to be seen Though by the Devil himself , him overweening To over-reach , but with the Serpent meeting Fool 'd and beguil 'd , by him thou , I by thee , 880 To trust thee from my side , imagin 'd wise , Constant , mature , proof against all assaults , And understood not all was but a shew Rather then solid vertu , all but a Rib Crooked by nature , bent , as now appears , More to the part sinister from me drawn , Well if thrown out , as supernumerarie To my just number found . O why did God , Creator wise , that peopl 'd highest Heav'n With Spirits Masculine , create at last 890 This noveltie on Earth , this fair defect Of Nature , and not fill the World at once With Men as Angels without Feminine , Or find some other way to generate Mankind ? this mischief had not then befall'n , And more that shall befall , innumerable Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares , And straight conjunction with this Sex : for either He never shall find out fit Mate , but such As some misfortune brings him , or mistake , 900 Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain Through her perverseness , but shall see her gaind By a farr worse , or if she love , withheld By Parents , or his happiest choice too late Shall meet , alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound To a fell Adversarie , his hate or shame : Which infinite calamitie shall cause To humane life , and houshold peace confound . He added not , and from her turn 'd , but Eve Not so repulst , with Tears that ceas 'd not flowing , 910 And tresses all disorderd , at his feet Fell humble , and imbracing them , besaught His peace , and thus proceeded in her plaint . Forsake me not thus , Adam , witness Heav'n What love sincere , and reverence in my heart I beare thee , and unweeting have offended , Unhappilie deceav 'd ; thy suppliant I beg , and clasp thy knees ; bereave me not , Whereon I live , thy gentle looks , thy aid , Thy counsel in this uttermost distress , 920 My onely strength and stay : forlorn of thee , Whither shall I betake me , where subsist ? While yet we live , scarse one short hour perhaps , Between us two let there be peace , both joyning , As joyn 'd in injuries , one enmitie Against a Foe by doom express assign 'd us , That cruel Serpent : On me exercise not Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n , On me already lost , mee then thy self More miserable ; both have sin 'd , but thou 930 Against God onely , I against God and thee , And to the place of judgement will return , There with my cries importune Heaven , that all The sentence from thy head remov 'd may light On me , sole cause to thee of all this woe , Mee mee onely just object of his ire . She ended weeping , and her lowlie plight , Immoveable till peace obtain 'd from fault Acknowledg 'd and deplor 'd , in Adam wraught Commiseration ; soon his heart relented 940 Towards her , his life so late and sole delight , Now at his feet submissive in distress , Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking , His counsel whom she had displeas 'd , his aide ; As one disarm 'd , his anger all he lost , And thus with peaceful words uprais 'd her soon . Unwarie , and too desirous , as before , So now of what thou knowst not , who desir'st The punishment all on thy self ; alas , Beare thine own first , ill able to sustaine 950 His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part , And my displeasure bearst so ill . If Prayers Could alter high Decrees , I to that place Would speed before thee , and be louder heard , That on my head all might be visited , Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n , To me committed and by me expos 'd . But rise , let us no more contend , nor blame Each other , blam 'd enough elsewhere , but strive In offices of Love , how we may light'n 960 Each others burden in our share of woe ; Since this days Death denounc't , if ought I see , Will prove no sudden , but a slow-pac't evill , A long days dying to augment our paine , And to our Seed ( O hapless Seed ! ) deriv 'd . To whom thus Eve , recovering heart , repli 'd . Adam , by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can finde , Found so erroneous , thence by just event Found so unfortunate ; nevertheless , 970 Restor 'd by thee , vile as I am , to place Of new acceptance , hopeful to regaine Thy Love , the sole contentment of my heart , Living or dying from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n , Tending to som relief of our extremes , Or end , though sharp and sad , yet tolerable , As in our evils , and of easier choice . If care of our descent perplex us most , Which must be born to certain woe , devourd 980 By Death at last , and miserable it is To be to others cause of misery , Our own begotten , and of our Loines to bring Into this cursed World a woful Race , That after wretched Life must be at last Food for so foule a Monster , in thy power It lies , yet ere Conception to prevent The Race unblest , to being yet unbegot . Childless thou art , Childless remaine : So Death shall be deceav 'd his glut , and with us two 990 Be forc 'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw . But if thou judge it hard and difficult , Conversing , looking , loving , to abstain From Loves due Rites , Nuptial embraces sweet , And with desire to languish without hope , Before the present object languishing With like desire , which would be miserie And torment less then none of what we dread , Then both our selves and Seed at once to free From what we fear for both , let us make short , 1000 Let us seek Death , or hee not found , supply With our own hands his Office on our selves ; Why stand we longer shivering under feares , That shew no end but Death , and have the power , Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing , Destruction with destruction to destroy . She ended heer , or vehement despaire Broke off the rest ; so much of Death her thoughts Had entertaind , as di 'd her Cheeks with pale . But Adam with such counsel nothing sway 'd , 1010 To better hopes his more attentive minde Labouring had rais 'd , and thus to Eve repli 'd . Eve , thy contempt of life and pleasure seems To argue in thee somthing more sublime And excellent then what thy minde contemnes ; But self-destruction therefore saught , refutes That excellence thought in thee , and implies , Not thy contempt , but anguish and regret For loss of life and pleasure overlov 'd . Or if thou covet death , as utmost end 1020 Of miserie , so thinking to evade The penaltie pronounc't , doubt not but God Hath wiselier arm 'd his vengeful ire then so To be forestall 'd ; much more I fear least Death So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine We are by doom to pay ; rather such acts Of contumacie will provoke the highest To make death in us live : Then let us seek Som safer resolution , which methinks I have in view , calling to minde with heed 1030 Part of our Sentence , that thy Seed shall bruise The Serpents head ; piteous amends , unless Be meant , whom I conjecture , our grand Foe Satan , who in the Serpent hath contriv 'd Against us this deceit : to crush his head Would be revenge indeed ; which will be lost By death brought on our selves , or childless days Resolv 'd , as thou proposest ; so our Foe Shall scape his punishment ordain 'd , and wee Instead shall double ours upon our heads . 1040 No more be mention 'd then of violence Against our selves , and wilful barrenness , That cuts us off from hope , and savours onely Rancor and pride , impatience and despite , Reluctance against God and his just yoke Laid on our Necks . Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard and judg 'd Without wrauth or reviling ; wee expected Immediate dissolution , which we thought Was meant by Death that day , when lo , to thee 1050 Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold , And bringing forth , soon recompenc't with joy , Fruit of thy Womb : On mee the Curse aslope Glanc 'd on the ground , with labour I must earne My bread ; what harm ? Idleness had bin worse ; My labour will sustain me ; and least Cold Or Heat should injure us , his timely care Hath unbesaught provided , and his hands Cloath 'd us unworthie , pitying while he judg 'd ; How much more , if we pray him , will his ear 1060 Be open , and his heart to pitie incline , And teach us further by what means to shun Th ’ inclement Seasons , Rain , Ice , Hail and Snow , Which now the Skie with various Face begins To shew us in this Mountain , while the Winds Blow moist and keen , shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading Trees ; which bids us seek Som better shroud , som better warmth to cherish Our Limbs benumm 'd , ere this diurnal Starr Leave cold the Night , how we his gather 'd beams 1070 Reflected , may with matter sere foment , Or by collision of two bodies grinde The Air attrite to Fire , as late the Clouds Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock Tine the slant Lightning , whose thwart flame driv'n down Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine , And sends a comfortable heat from farr , Which might supplie the Sun : such Fire to use , And what may else be remedie or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought , 1080 Hee will instruct us praying , and of Grace Beseeching him , so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life , sustain 'd By him with many comforts , till we end In dust , our final rest and native home . What better can we do , then to the place Repairing where he judg 'd us , prostrate fall Before him reverent , and there confess Humbly our faults , and pardon beg , with tears Watering the ground , and with our sighs the Air 1090 Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign Of sorrow unfeign 'd , and humiliation meek . Undoubtedly he will relent and turn From his displeasure ; in whose look serene , When angry most he seem 'd and most severe , What else but favor , grace , and mercie shon ? So spake our Father penitent , nor Eve Felt less remorse : they forthwith to the place Repairing where he judg 'd them prostrate fell Before him reverent , and both confess 'd 1100 Humbly thir faults , and pardon beg 'd , with tears Watering the ground , and with thir sighs the Air Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign Of sorrow unfeign 'd , and humiliation meek .

The Son of God presents to his Father the Prayers of our first Parents now repenting , and intercedes for them : God accepts them , but declares that they must no longer abide in Paradise ; sends Michael with a Band of Cherubim to dispossess them ; but first to reveal to Adam future things : Michaels coming down , Adam shews to Eve certain ominous signs ; he discerns Michaels approach , goes out to meet him : the Angel denounces thir departure . Eve 's Lamentation . Adam pleads , but submits : The Angel leads him up to a high Hill , sets before him in a vision what shall happ'n till the Flood . Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood Praying , for from the Mercie-seat above Prevenient Grace descending had remov 'd The stonie from thir hearts , and made new flesh Regenerat grow instead , that sighs now breath 'd Unutterable , which the Spirit of prayer Inspir 'd , and wing 'd for Heav'n with speedier flight Then loudest Oratorie : yet thir port Not of mean suiters , nor important less Seem 'd thir Petition , then when th ’ ancient Pair 10 In Fables old , less ancient yet then these , Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore The Race of Mankind drownd , before the Shrine Of Themis stood devout . To Heav'n thir prayers Flew up , nor missed the way , by envious windes Blow'n vagabond or frustrate : in they passd Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores ; then clad With incense , where the Golden Altar fum 'd , By thir great Intercessor , came in sight Before the Fathers Throne : Them the glad Son 20 Presenting , thus to intercede began . See Father , what first fruits on Earth are sprung From thy implanted Grace in Man , these Sighs And Prayers , which in this Golden Censer , mixt With Incense , I thy Priest before thee bring , Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed Sow'n with contrition in his heart , then those Which his own hand manuring all the Trees Of Paradise could have produc't , ere fall'n From innocence . Now therefore bend thine eare 30 To supplication , heare his sighs though mute ; Unskilful with what words to pray , let mee Interpret for him , mee his Advocate And propitiation , all his works on mee Good or not good ingraft , my Merit those Shall perfet , and for these my Death shall pay . Accept me , and in mee from these receave The smell of peace toward Mankinde , let him live Before thee reconcil 'd , at least his days Numberd , though sad , till Death , his doom ( which I 40 To mitigate thus plead , not to reverse ) To better life shall yeeld him , where with mee All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss , Made one with me as I with thee am one . To whom the Father , without Cloud , serene . All thy request for Man , accepted Son , Obtain , all thy request was my Decree : But longer in that Paradise to dwell , The Law I gave to Nature him forbids : Those pure immortal Elements that know 50 No gross , no unharmoneous mixture foule , Eject him tainted now , and purge him off As a distemper , gross to aire as gross , And mortal food , as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by Sin , that first Distemperd all things , and of incorrupt Corrupted . I at first with two fair gifts Created him endowd , with Happiness And Immortalitie : that fondly lost , This other serv 'd but to eternize woe ; 60 Till I provided Death ; so Death becomes His final remedie , and after Life Tri 'd in sharp tribulation , and refin 'd By Faith and faithful works , to second Life , Wak't in the renovation of the just , Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd . But let us call to Synod all the Blest Through Heav'ns wide bounds ; from them I will not hide My judgments , how with Mankind I proceed , As how with peccant Angels late they saw ; 70 And in thir state , though firm , stood more confirmd . He ended , and the Son gave signal high To the bright Minister that watchd , hee blew His Trumpet , heard in Oreb since perhaps When God descended , and perhaps once more To sound at general Doom . Th ’ Angelic blast Filld all the Regions : from thir blissful Bowrs Of Amarantin Shade , Fountain or Spring , By the waters of Life , where ere they sate In fellowships of joy : the Sons of Light 80 Hasted , resorting to the Summons high , And took thir Seats ; till from his Throne supream Th ’ Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will . O Sons , like one of us Man is become To know both Good and Evil , since his taste Of that defended Fruit ; but let him boast His knowledge of Good lost , and Evil got , Happier , had it suffic 'd him to have known Good by it self , and Evil not at all . He sorrows now , repents , and prayes contrite , 90 My motions in him , longer then they move , His heart I know , how variable and vain Self-left . Least therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the Tree of Life , and eat , And live for ever , dream at least to live Forever , to remove him I decree , And send him from the Garden forth to Till The Ground whence he was taken , fitter soile . Michael , this my behest have thou in charge , Take to thee from among the Cherubim 100 Thy choice of flaming Warriours , least the Fiend Or in behalf of Man , or to invade Vacant possession som new trouble raise : Hast thee , and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair , From hallowd ground th ’ unholie , and denounce To them and to thir Progenie from thence Perpetual banishment . Yet least they faint At the sad Sentence rigorously urg 'd , For I behold them soft'nd and with tears 110 Bewailing thir excess , all terror hide . If patiently thy bidding they obey , Dismiss them not disconsolate ; reveale To Adam what shall come in future dayes , As I shall thee enlighten , intermix My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd ; So send them forth , though sorrowing , yet in peace : And on the East side of the Garden place , Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes , Cherubic watch , and of a Sword the flame 120 Wide waving , all approach farr off to fright , And guard all passage to the Tree of Life : Least Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foule , and all my Trees thir prey , With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude . He ceas 'd ; and th ’ Archangelic Power prepar 'd For swift descent , with him the Cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim ; four faces each Had , like a double Janus , all thir shape Spangl 'd with eyes more numerous then those 130 Of Argus , and more wakeful then to drouze , Charm 'd with Arcadian Pipe , the Pastoral Reed Of Hermes , or his opiate Rod . Meanwhile To resalute the World with sacred Light Leucothea wak 'd , and with fresh dews imbalmd The Earth , when Adam and first Matron Eve Had ended now thir Orisons , and found , Strength added from above , new hope to spring Out of despaire , joy , but with fear yet linkt ; Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd . 140 Eve , easily may Faith admit , that all The good which we enjoy , from Heav'n descends But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n So prevalent as to concerne the mind Of God high blest , or to incline his will , Hard to belief may seem ; yet this will Prayer , Or one short sigh of humane breath , up-borne Ev'n to the Seat of God . For since I saught By Prayer th ’ offended Deitie to appease , Kneel 'd and before him humbl 'd all my heart , 150 Methought I saw him placable and mild , Bending his eare ; perswasion in me grew That I was heard with favour ; peace returnd Home to my brest , and to my memorie His promise , that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe ; Which then not minded in dismay , yet now Assures me that the bitterness of death Is past , and we shall live . Whence Haile to thee , Eve rightly call 'd , Mother of all Mankind , Mother of all things living , since by thee 160 Man is to live , and all things live for Man . To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek . Ill worthie I such title should belong To me transgressour , who for thee ordaind A help , became thy snare ; to mee reproach Rather belongs , distrust and all dispraise : But infinite in pardon was my Judge , That I who first brought Death on all , am grac't The sourse of life ; next favourable thou , Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't , 170 Farr other name deserving . But the Field To labour calls us now with sweat impos 'd , Though after sleepless Night ; for see the Morn , All unconcern 'd with our unrest , begins Her rosie progress smiling ; let us forth , I never from thy side henceforth to stray , Wherere our days work lies , though now enjoind Laborious , till day droop ; while here we dwell , What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes ? Here let us live , though in fall'n state , content . 180 So spake , so wish 'd much-humbl 'd Eve , but Fate Subscrib 'd not ; Nature first gave Signs , imprest On Bird , Beast , Aire , Aire suddenly eclips 'd After short blush of Morn ; nigh in her sight The Bird of Jove , stoopt from his aerie tour , Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove : Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods , First Hunter then , pursu 'd a gentle brace , Goodliest of all the Forrest , Hart and Hinde ; Direct to th ’ Eastern Gate was bent thir flight . 190 Adam observ 'd , and with his Eye the chase Pursuing , not unmov 'd to Eve thus spake . O Eve , some furder change awaits us nigh , Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews Forerunners of his purpose , or to warn Us haply too secure of our discharge From penaltie , because from death releast Some days ; how long , and what till then our life , Who knows , or more then this , that we are dust , And thither must return and be no more . 200 Why else this double object in our sight Of flight pursu 'd in th ’ Air and ore the ground One way the self-same hour ? why in the East Darkness ere Dayes mid-course , and Morning light More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws O 're the blew Firmament a radiant white , And slow descends , with somthing heav'nly fraught . He err 'd not , for by this the heav'nly Bands Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now In Paradise , and on a Hill made alt , 210 A glorious Apparition , had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimm 'd Adams eye . Not that more glorious , when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim , where he saw The field Pavilion 'd with his Guardians bright ; Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd In Dothan , cover 'd with a Camp of Fire , Against the Syrian King , who to surprize One man , Assassin-like had levied Warr , Warr unproclam 'd . The Princely Hierarch 220 In thir bright stand , there left his Powers to seise Possession of the Garden ; hee alone , To finde where Adam shelterd , took his way , Not unperceav 'd of Adam , who to Eve , While the great Visitant approachd , thus spake . Eve , now expect great tidings , which perhaps Of us will soon determin , or impose New Laws to be observ 'd ; for I descrie From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill One of the heav'nly Host , and by his Gate 230 None of the meanest , some great Potentate Or of the Thrones above , such Majestie Invests him coming ; yet not terrible , That I should fear , nor sociably mild , As Raphael , that I should much confide , But solemn and sublime , whom not to offend , With reverence I must meet , and thou retire . He ended ; and th ’ Arch-Angel soon drew nigh , Not in his shape Celestial , but as Man Clad to meet Man ; over his lucid Armes 240 A militarie Vest of purple flowd Livelier then Meliboean , or the graine Of Sarra , worn by Kings and Hero 's old In time of Truce ; Iris had dipt the wooff ; His starrie Helme unbuckl 'd shew 'd him prime In Manhood where Youth ended ; by his side As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword , Satans dire dread , and in his hand the Spear . Adam bowd low , hee Kingly from his State Inclin 'd not , but his coming thus declar 'd . 250 Adam , Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs : Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard , and Death , Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress , Defeated of his seisure many dayes Giv'n thee of Grace , wherein thou may'st repent , And one bad act with many deeds well done Mayst cover : well may then thy Lord appeas 'd Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes ; But longer in this Paradise to dwell Permits not ; to remove thee I am come , 260 And send thee from the Garden forth to till The ground whence thou wast tak'n , fitter Soile . He added not , for Adam at the newes Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood , That all his senses bound ; Eve , who unseen Yet all had heard , with audible lament Discover 'd soon the place of her retire . O unexpected stroke , worse then of Death ! Must I thus leave thee Paradise ? thus leave Thee Native Soile , these happie Walks and Shades , 270 Fit haunt of Gods ? where I had hope to spend , Quiet though sad , the respit of that day That must be mortal to us both . O flours , That never will in other Climate grow , My early visitation , and my last At Eev'n , which I bred up with tender hand From the first op'ning bud , and gave ye Names , Who now shall reare ye to the Sun , or ranke Your Tribes , and water from th ’ ambrosial Fount ? Thee lastly nuptial Bowre , by mee adornd 280 With what to sight or smell was sweet ; from thee How shall I part , and whither wander down Into a lower World , to this obscure And wilde , how shall we breath in other Aire Less pure , accustomd to immortal Fruits ? Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde . Lament not Eve , but patiently resigne What justly thou hast lost ; nor set thy heart , Thus over fond , on that which is not thine ; Thy going is not lonely , with thee goes 290 Thy Husband , him to follow thou art bound ; Where he abides , think there thy native soile . Adam by this from the cold sudden damp Recovering , and his scatterd spirits returnd , To Michael thus his humble words addressd . Celestial , whether among the Thrones , or nam 'd Of them the Highest , for such of shape may seem Prince above Princes , gently hast thou tould Thy message , which might else in telling wound , And in performing end us ; what besides 300 Of sorrow and dejection and despair Our frailtie can sustain , thy tidings bring , Departure from this happy place , our sweet Recess , and onely consolation left Familiar to our eyes , all places else Inhospitable appeer and desolate , Nor knowing us nor known : and if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of him who all things can , I would not cease To wearie him with my assiduous cries : 310 But prayer against his absolute Decree No more availes then breath against the winde , Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth : Therefore to his great bidding I submit . This most afflicts me , that departing hence , As from his face I shall be hid , deprivd His blessed count'nance ; here I could frequent , With worship , place by place where he voutsaf 'd Presence Divine , and to my Sons relate ; On this Mount he appeerd , under this Tree 320 Stood visible , among these Pines his voice I heard , here with him at this Fountain talk 'd : So many grateful Altars I would reare Of grassie Terfe , and pile up every Stone Of lustre from the brook , in memorie , Or monument to Ages , and thereon Offer sweet smelling Gumms &amp; Fruits and Flours : In yonder nether World where shall I seek His bright appearances , or footstep trace ? For though I fled him angrie , yet recall 'd 330 To life prolongd and promisd Race , I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory , and farr off his steps adore . To whom thus Michael with regard benigne . Adam , thou know'st Heav'n his , and all the Earth Not this Rock onely ; his Omnipresence fills Land , Sea , and Aire , and every kinde that lives , Fomented by his virtual power and warmd : All th ’ Earth he gave thee to possess and rule , No despicable gift ; surmise not then 340 His presence to these narrow bounds confin 'd Of Paradise or Eden : this had been Perhaps thy Capital Seate , from whence had spred All generations , and had hither come From all the ends of th ’ Earth , to celebrate And reverence thee thir great Progenitor . But this praeeminence thou hast lost , brought down To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons : Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine God is as here , and will be found alike 350 Present , and of his presence many a signe Still following thee , still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal Love , his Face Express , and of his steps the track Divine . Which that thou mayst beleeve , and be confirmd , Ere thou from hence depart , know I am sent To shew thee what shall come in future dayes To thee and to thy Ofspring ; good with bad Expect to hear , supernal Grace contending With sinfulness of Men ; thereby to learn 360 True patience , and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow , equally enur 'd By moderation either state to beare , Prosperous or adverse : so shalt thou lead Safest thy life , and best prepar 'd endure Thy mortal passage when it comes . Ascend This Hill ; let Eve ( for I have drencht her eyes ) Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st , As once thou slepst , while Shee to life was formd . To whom thus Adam gratefully repli 'd . 370 Ascend , I follow thee , safe Guide , the path Thou lead'st me , and to the hand of Heav'n submit , However chast'ning , to the evil turne My obvious breast , arming to overcom By suffering , and earne rest from labour won , If so I may attain . So both ascend In the Visions of God : It was a Hill Of Paradise the highest , from whose top The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay . 380 Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round , Whereon for different cause the Tempter set Our second Adam in the Wilderness , To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory . His Eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern Fame , the Seat Of mightiest Empire , from the destind Walls Of Cambalu , seat of Cathaian Can And Samarchand by Oxus , Temirs Throne , To Paquin of Sinaean Kings , and thence 390 To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul Down to the golden Chersonese , or where The Persian in Ecbatan sate , or since In Hispahan , or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco , or the Sultan in Bizance , Turchestan-born ; nor could his eye not ken Th ’ Empire of Negus to his utmost Port Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings Mombaza , and Quiloa , and Melind , And Sofala thought Ophir , to the Realme 400 Of Congo , and Angola fardest South ; Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount The Kingdoms of Almansor , Fez , and Sus , Marocco and Algiers , and Tremisen ; On Europe thence , and where Rome was to sway The World : in Spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume , And Cusco in Peru , the richer seat Of Atabalipa , and yet unspoil 'd Guiana , whose great Citie Geryons Sons 410 Call El Dorado : but to nobler sights Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov 'd Which that false Fruit that promis 'd clearer sight Had bred ; then purg 'd with Euphrasie and Rue The visual Nerve , for he had much to see ; And from the Well of Life three drops instill 'd . So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc 'd , Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight , That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes , Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst : 420 But him the gentle Angel by the hand Soon rais 'd , and his attention thus recall 'd . Adam , now ope thine eyes , and first behold Th ’ effects which thy original crime hath wrought In some to spring from thee , who never touch 'd Th ’ excepted Tree , nor with the Snake conspir 'd , Nor sinn 'd thy sin , yet from that sin derive Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds . His eyes he op'nd , and beheld a field , Part arable and tilth , whereon were Sheaves 430 New reapt , the other part sheep-walks and foulds ; Ith ’ midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood Rustic , of grassie sord ; thither anon A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought First Fruits , the green Eare , and the yellow Sheaf , Uncull 'd , as came to hand ; a Shepherd next More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock Choicest and best ; then sacrificing , laid The Inwards and thir Fat , with Incense strew 'd , On the cleft Wood , and all due Rites perform 'd . 440 His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n Consum 'd with nimble glance , and grateful steame ; The others not , for his was not sincere ; Whereat hee inlie rag 'd , and as they talk 'd , Smote him into the Midriff with a stone That beat out life ; he fell , and deadly pale Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus 'd . Much at that sight was Adam in his heart Dismai 'd , and thus in haste to th ’ Angel cri 'd . O Teacher , some great mischief hath befall'n 450 To that meek man , who well had sacrific 'd ; Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid ? T ’ whom Michael thus , hee also mov 'd , repli 'd . These two are Brethren , Adam , and to come Out of thy loyns ; th ’ unjust the just hath slain , For envie that his Brothers Offering found From Heav'n acceptance ; but the bloodie Fact Will be aveng 'd , and th ’ others Faith approv 'd Loose no reward , though here thou see him die , Rowling in dust and gore . To which our Sire . 460 Alas , both for the deed and for the cause ! But have I now seen Death ? Is this the way I must return to native dust ? O sight Of terrour , foul and ugly to behold , Horrid to think , how horrible to feel ! To whom thus Michael . Death thou hast seen In his first shape on man ; but many shapes Of Death , and many are the wayes that lead To his grim Cave , all dismal ; yet to sense More terrible at th ’ entrance then within . 470 Some , as thou saw'st , by violent stroke shall die , By Fire , Flood , Famin , by Intemperance more In Meats and Drinks , which on the Earth shal bring Diseases dire , of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear ; that thou mayst know What miserie th ’ inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on men . Immediately a place Before his eyes appeard , sad , noysom , dark , A Lazar-house it seemd , wherein were laid Numbers of all diseas 'd , all maladies 480 Of gastly Spasm , or racking torture , qualmes Of heart-sick Agonie , all feavorous kinds , Convulsions , Epilepsies , fierce Catarrhs , Intestin Stone and Ulcer , Colic pangs , Dropsies , and Asthma 's , and Joint-racking Rheums . Dire was the tossing , deep the groans , despair Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch ; And over them triumphant Death his Dart Shook , but delaid to strike , though oft invok't With vows , as thir chief good , and final hope . 490 Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long Drie-ey 'd behold ? Adam could not , but wept , Though not of Woman born ; compassion quell 'd His best of Man , and gave him up to tears A space , till firmer thoughts restraind excess , And scarce recovering words his plaint renew 'd . O miserable Mankind , to what fall Degraded , to what wretched state reserv 'd ? Better end heer unborn . Why is life giv'n To be thus wrested from us ? rather why 500 Obtruded on us thus ? who if we knew What we receive , would either not accept Life offer 'd , or soon beg to lay it down , Glad to be so dismist in peace . Can thus Th ’ Image of God in man created once So goodly and erect , though faultie since , To such unsightly sufferings be debas't Under inhuman pains ? Why should not Man , Retaining still Divine similitude In part , from such deformities be free , 510 And for his Makers Image sake exempt ? Thir Makers Image , answerd Michael , then Forsook them , when themselves they villifi 'd To serve ungovern 'd appetite , and took His Image whom they serv 'd , a brutish vice , Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve . Therefore so abject is thir punishment , Disfiguring not Gods likeness , but thir own , Or if his likeness , by themselves defac't While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules 520 To loathsom sickness , worthily , since they Gods Image did not reverence in themselves . I yeild it just , said Adam , and submit . But is there yet no other way , besides These painful passages , how we may come To Death , and mix with our connatural dust ? There is , said Michael , if thou well observe The rule of not too much , by temperance taught In what thou eatst and drinkst , seeking from thence Due nourishment , not gluttonous delight , 530 Till many years over thy head return : So maist thou live , till like ripe Fruit thou drop Into thy Mothers lap , or be with ease Gatherd , not harshly pluckt , for death mature : This is old age ; but then thou must outlive Thy youth , thy strength , thy beauty , which will change To witherd weak &amp; gray ; thy Senses then Obtuse , all taste of pleasure must forgoe , To what thou hast , and for the Aire of youth Hopeful and cheerful , in thy blood will reigne 540 A melancholly damp of cold and dry To waigh thy spirits down , and last consume The Balme of Life . To whom our Ancestor . Henceforth I flie not Death , nor would prolong Life much , bent rather how I may be quit Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge , Which I must keep till my appointed day Of rendring up , Michael to him repli 'd . Nor love thy Life , nor hate ; but what thou livst Live well , how long or short permit to Heav'n : 550 And now prepare thee for another sight . He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine , whereon Were Tents of various hue ; by some were herds Of Cattel grazing : others , whence the sound Of Instruments that made melodious chime Was heard , of Harp and Organ ; and who moovd Thir stops and chords was seen : his volant touch Instinct through all proportions low and high Fled and pursu 'd transverse the resonant fugue . In other part stood one who at the Forge 560 Labouring , two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted ( whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale , Down to the veins of Earth , thence gliding hot To som Caves mouth , or whether washt by stream From underground ) the liquid Ore he dreind Into fit moulds prepar 'd ; from which he formd First his own Tooles ; then , what might else be wrought Fulfil or grav'n in mettle . After these , But on the hether side a different sort 570 From the high neighbouring Hills , which was thir Seat , Down to the Plain descended : by thir guise Just men they seemd , and all thir study bent To worship God aright , and know his works Not hid , nor those things lost which might preserve Freedom and Peace to men : they on the Plain Long had not walkt , when from the Tents behold A Beavie of fair Women , richly gay In Gems and wanton dress ; to the Harp they sung Soft amorous Ditties , and in dance came on : 580 The Men though grave , ey 'd them , and let thir eyes Rove without rein , till in the amorous Net Fast caught , they lik 'd , and each his liking chose ; And now of love they treat till th ’ Eevning Star Loves Harbinger appeerd ; then all in heat They light the Nuptial Torch , and bid invoke Hymen , then first to marriage Rites invok't ; With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound . Such happy interview and fair event Of love &amp; youth not lost , Songs , Garlands , Flours , 590 And charming Symphonies attach 'd the heart Of Adam , soon enclin 'd to admit delight , The bent of Nature ; which he thus express 'd . True opener of mine eyes , prime Angel blest , Much better seems this Vision , and more hope Of peaceful dayes portends , then those two past ; Those were of hate and death , or pain much worse , Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends . To whom thus Michael . Judg not what is best By pleasure , though to Nature seeming meet , 600 Created , as thou art , to nobler end Holie and pure , conformitie divine . Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant , were the Tents Of wickedness , wherein shall dwell his Race Who slew his Brother ; studious they appere Of Arts that polish Life , Inventers rare , Unmindful of thir Maker , though his Spirit Taught them , but they his gifts acknowledg 'd none . Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget ; For that fair femal Troop thou sawst , that seemd 610 Of Goddesses , so blithe , so smooth , so gay , Yet empty of all good wherein consists Womans domestic honour and chief praise ; Bred onely and completed to the taste Of lustful apperence , to sing , to dance , To dress , and troule the Tongue , and roule the Eye . To these that sober Race of Men , whose lives Religious titl 'd them the Sons of God , Shall yeild up all thir vertue , all thir fame Ignobly , to the trains and to the smiles 620 Of these fair Atheists , and now swim in joy , ( Erelong to swim at larg ) and laugh ; for which The world erelong a world of tears must weepe . To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft . O pittie and shame , that they who to live well Enterd so faire , should turn aside to tread Paths indirect , or in the mid way faint ! But still I see the tenor of Mans woe Holds on the same , from Woman to begin . From Mans effeminate slackness it begins , 630 Said th ’ Angel , who should better hold his place By wisdome , and superiour gifts receavd . But now prepare thee for another Scene . He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred Before him , Towns , and rural works between , Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs , Concours in Arms , fierce Faces threatning Warr , Giants of mightie Bone , and bould emprise ; Part wield thir Arms , part courb the foaming Steed , Single or in Array of Battel rang 'd 640 Both Horse and Foot , nor idely mustring stood ; One way a Band select from forage drives A herd of Beeves , faire Oxen and faire Kine From a fat Meddow ground ; or fleecy Flock , Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine , Thir Bootie ; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye , But call in aide , which tacks a bloody Fray ; With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine ; Where Cattel pastur 'd late , now scatterd lies With Carcasses and Arms th ’ ensanguind Field 650 Deserted : Others to a Citie strong Lay Siege , encampt ; by Batterie , Scale , and Mine , Assaulting ; others from the Wall defend With Dart and Jav'lin , Stones and sulfurous Fire ; On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds . In other part the scepter 'd Haralds call To Council in the Citie Gates : anon Grey-headed men and grave , with Warriours mixt , Assemble , and Harangues are heard , but soon In factious opposition , till at last 660 Of middle Age one rising , eminent In wise deport , spake much of Right and Wrong , Of Justice , of Religion , Truth and Peace , And Judgement from above : him old and young Exploded , and had seiz 'd with violent hands , Had not a Cloud descending snatch 'd him thence Unseen amid the throng : so violence Proceeded , and Oppression , and Sword-Law Through all the Plain , and refuge none was found . Adam was all in tears , and to his guide 670 Lamenting turnd full sad ; O what are these , Deaths Ministers , not Men , who thus deal Death Inhumanly to men , and multiply Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew His Brother ; for of whom such massacher Make they but of thir Brethren , men of men ? But who was that Just Man , whom had not Heav'n Rescu 'd , had in his Righteousness bin lost ? To whom thus Michael ; These are the product Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st ; 680 Where good with bad were matcht , who of themselves Abhor to joyn ; and by imprudence mixt , Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind . Such were these Giants , men of high renown ; For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir 'd , And Valour and Heroic Vertu call 'd ; To overcome in Battel , and subdue Nations , and bring home spoils with infinite Man-slaughter , shall be held the highest pitch Of human Glorie , and for Glorie done 690 Of triumph , to be styl 'd great Conquerours , Patrons of Mankind , Gods , and Sons of Gods , Destroyers rightlier call 'd and Plagues of men . Thus Fame shall be achiev 'd , renown on Earth , And what most merits fame in silence hid . But hee the seventh from thee , whom thou beheldst The onely righteous in a World perverse , And therefore hated , therefore so beset With Foes for daring single to be just , And utter odious Truth , that God would come 700 To judge them with his Saints : Him the most High Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds Did , as thou sawst , receave , to walk with God High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss , Exempt from Death ; to shew thee what reward Awaits the good , the rest what punishment ; Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold . He look 'd , &amp; saw the face of things quite chang 'd ; The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar , All now was turn 'd to jollitie and game , 710 To luxurie and riot , feast and dance , Marrying or prostituting , as befell , Rape or Adulterie , where passing faire Allurd them ; thence from Cups to civil Broiles . At length a Reverend Sire among them came , And of thir doings great dislike declar 'd , And testifi 'd against thir wayes ; hee oft Frequented thir Assemblies , whereso met , Triumphs or Festivals , and to them preachd Conversion and Repentance , as to Souls 720 In prison under Judgements imminent : But all in vain : which when he saw , he ceas 'd Contending , and remov 'd his Tents farr off ; Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall , Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk , Measur 'd by Cubit , length , &amp; breadth , and highth , Smeard round with Pitch , and in the side a dore Contriv 'd , and of provisions laid in large For Man and Beast : when loe a wonder strange ! Of everie Beast , and Bird , and Insect small 730 Came seavens , and pairs , and enterd in , as taught Thir order ; last the Sire , and his three Sons With thir four Wives , and God made fast the dore . Meanwhile the Southwind rose , &amp; with black wings Wide hovering , all the Clouds together drove From under Heav'n ; the Hills to their supplie Vapour , and Exhalation dusk and moist , Sent up amain ; and now the thick'nd Skie Like a dark Ceeling stood ; down rush 'd the Rain Impetuous , and continu 'd till the Earth 740 No more was seen ; the floating Vessel swum Uplifted ; and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting o 're the Waves , all dwellings else Flood overwhelmd , and them with all thir pomp Deep under water rould ; Sea cover 'd Sea , Sea without shoar ; and in thir Palaces Where luxurie late reign 'd , Sea-monsters whelp 'd And stabl 'd ; of Mankind , so numerous late , All left , in one small bottom swum imbark't . How didst thou grieve then , Adam , to behold 750 The end of all thy Ofspring , end so sad , Depopulation ; thee another Floud , Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown 'd , And sunk thee as thy Sons ; till gently reard By th ’ Angel , on thy feet thou stoodst at last , Though comfortless , as when a Father mourns His Childern , all in view destroyd at once ; And scarce to th ’ Angel utterdst thus thy plaint . O Visions ill foreseen ! better had I Liv 'd ignorant of future , so had borne 760 My part of evil onely , each dayes lot Anough to bear ; those now , that were dispenst The burd'n of many Ages , on me light At once , by my foreknowledge gaining Birth Abortive , to torment me ere thir being , With thought that they must be . Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall Him or his Childern , evil he may be sure , Which neither his foreknowing can prevent , And hee the future evil shall no less 770 In apprehension then in substance feel Grievous to bear : but that care now is past , Man is not whom to warne : those few escap't Famin and anguish will at last consume Wandring that watrie Desert : I had hope When violence was ceas't , and Warr on Earth , All would have then gon well , peace would have crownd With length of happy days the race of man ; But I was farr deceav 'd ; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste . 780 How comes it thus ? unfould , Celestial Guide , And whether here the Race of man will end . To whom thus Michael . Those whom last thou sawst In triumph and luxurious wealth , are they First seen in acts of prowess eminent And great exploits , but of true vertu void ; Who having spilt much blood , and don much waste Subduing Nations , and achievd thereby Fame in the World , high titles , and rich prey , Shall change thir course to pleasure , ease , and sloth , 790 Surfet , and lust , till wantonness and pride Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace . The conquerd also , and enslav 'd by Warr Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose And feare of God , from whom thir pietie feign 'd In sharp contest of Battel found no aide Against invaders ; therefore coold in zeale Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure , Worldlie or dissolute , on what thir Lords Shall leave them to enjoy ; for th ’ Earth shall bear 800 More then anough , that temperance may be tri 'd : So all shall turn degenerate , all deprav 'd , Justice and Temperance , Truth and Faith forgot ; One Man except , the onely Son of light In a dark Age , against example good , Against allurement , custom , and a World Offended ; fearless of reproach and scorn , Or violence , hee of thir wicked wayes Shall them admonish , and before them set The paths of righteousness , how much more safe , 810 And full of peace , denouncing wrauth to come On thir impenitence ; and shall returne Of them derided , but of God observd The one just Man alive ; by his command Shall build a wondrous Ark , as thou beheldst , To save himself and houshold from amidst A World devote to universal rack . No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg 'd , And shelterd round , but all the Cataracts 820 Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre Raine day and night , all fountaines of the Deep Broke up , shall heave the Ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds , till inundation rise Above the highest Hills : then shall this Mount Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd Out of his place , pushd by the horned floud , With all his verdure spoil 'd , and Trees adrift Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf , And there take root an Iland salt and bare , 830 The haunt of Seales and Orcs , and Sea-mews clang . To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctitie , if none be thither brought By Men who there frequent , or therein dwell . And now what further shall ensue , behold . He lookd , and saw the Ark hull on the floud , Which now abated , for the Clouds were fled , Drivn by a keen North-winde , that blowing drie Wrinkl 'd the face of Deluge , as decai 'd ; And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass 840 Gaz 'd hot , and of the fresh Wave largely drew , As after thirst , which made thir flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebbe , that stole With soft foot towards the deep , who now had stopt His Sluces , as the Heav'n his windows shut . The Ark no more now flotes , but seems on ground Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt . And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer ; With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde . 850 Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies , And after him , the surer messenger , A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light ; The second time returning , in his Bill An Olive leafe he brings , pacific signe : Anon drie ground appeers , and from his Arke The ancient Sire descends with all his Train ; Then with uplifted hands , and eyes devout , Grateful to Heav'n , over his head beholds 860 A dewie Cloud , and in the Cloud a Bow Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay , Betok'ning peace from God , and Cov'nant new . Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad Greatly rejoyc 'd , and thus his joy broke forth . O thou that future things canst represent As present , Heav'nly instructer , I revive At this last sight , assur 'd that Man shall live With all the Creatures , and thir seed preserve . Farr less I now lament for one whole World 870 Of wicked Sons destroyd , then I rejoyce For one Man found so perfet and so just , That God voutsafes to raise another World From him , and all his anger to forget . But say , what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn , Distended as the Brow of God appeas 'd , Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud , Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth ? To whom th ’ Archangel . Dextrously thou aim'st ; 880 So willingly doth God remit his Ire , Though late repenting him of Man deprav 'd , Griev 'd at his heart , when looking down he saw The whole Earth fill 'd with violence , and all flesh Corrupting each thir way ; yet those remoov 'd , Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight , That he relents , not to blot out mankind , And makes a Covenant never to destroy The Earth again by flood , nor let the Sea Surpass his bounds , nor Rain to drown the World 890 With Man therein or Beast ; but when he brings Over the Earth a Cloud , will therein set His triple-colour 'd Bow , whereon to look And call to mind his Cov'nant : Day and Night , Seed time and Harvest , Heat and hoary Frost Shall hold thir course , till fire purge all things new , Both Heav'n and Earth , wherein the just shall dwell .

The Angel Michael continues from the Flood to relate what shall succeed ; then , in the mention of Abraham , comes by degrees to explain who that Seed of the Woman shall be , which was promised Adam and Eve in the Fall ; his Incarnation , Death , Resurrection , and Ascention ; the state of the Church till his second Coming . Adam greatly satisfied and recomforted by these Relations and Promises descends the Hill with Michael ; wakens Eve , who all this while had slept , but with gentle dreams compos 'd to quietness of mind and submission . Michael in either hand leads them out of Paradise , the fiery Sword waving behind them , and the Cherubim taking thir Stations to guard the Place . [ As one who in his journey bates at Noone Though bent on speed , so heer the Archangel ’ paus 'd Betwixt the world destroy 'd and world restor 'd , If Adam aught perhaps might interpose ; Then with transition sweet new Speech resumes ] Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end ; And Man as from a second stock proceed . Much thou hast yet to see , but I perceave Thy mortal sight to faile ; objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense : 10 Henceforth what is to com I will relate , Thou therefore give due audience , and attend . This second sours of Men , while yet but few , And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in thir mindes , fearing the Deitie , With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead thir lives , and multiplie apace , Labouring the soile , and reaping plenteous crop , Corn wine and oyle ; and from the herd or flock , Oft sacrificing Bullock , Lamb , or Kid , 20 With large Wine-offerings pour 'd , and sacred Feast Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam 'd , and dwell Long time in peace by Families and Tribes Under paternal rule ; till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart , who not content With fair equalitie , fraternal state , Will arrogate Dominion undeserv 'd Over his brethren , and quite dispossess Concord and law of Nature from the Earth ; Hunting ( and Men not Beasts shall be his game ) 30 With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse Subjection to his Empire tyrannous : A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl 'd Before the Lord , as in despite of Heav'n , Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie ; And from Rebellion shall derive his name , Though of Rebellion others he accuse . Hee with a crew , whom like Ambition joyns With him or under him to tyrannize , Marching from Eden towards the West , shall finde 40 The Plain , wherein a black bituminous gurge Boiles out from under ground , the mouth of Hell ; Of Brick , and of that stuff they cast to build A Citie &amp; Towre , whose top may reach to Heav'n ; And get themselves a name , least far disperst In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost , Regardless whether good or evil fame . But God who oft descends to visit men Unseen , and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings , them beholding soon , 50 Comes down to see thir Citie , ere the Tower Obstruct Heav'n Towrs , and in derision sets Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase Quite out thir Native Language , and instead To sow a jangling noise of words unknown : Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud Among the Builders ; each to other calls Not understood , till hoarse , and all in rage , As mockt they storm ; great laughter was in Heav'n And looking down , to see the hubbub strange 60 And hear the din ; thus was the building left Ridiculous , and the work Confusion nam 'd . Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas 'd . O execrable Son so to aspire Above his Brethren , to himself affirming Authoritie usurpt , from God not giv'n : He gave us onely over Beast , Fish , Fowl Dominion absolute ; that right we hold By his donation ; but Man over men He made not Lord ; such title to himself 70 Reserving , human left from human free . But this Usurper his encroachment proud Stayes not on Man ; to God his Tower intends Siege and defiance : Wretched man ! what food Will he convey up thither to sustain Himself and his rash Armie , where thin Aire Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross , And famish him of Breath , if not of Bread ? To whom thus Michael . Justly thou abhorr'st That Son , who on the quiet state of men 80 Such trouble brought , affecting to subdue Rational Libertie ; yet know withall , Since thy original lapse , true Libertie Is lost , which alwayes with right Reason dwells Twinn 'd , and from her hath no dividual being : Reason in man obscur 'd , or not obeyd , Immediately inordinate desires And upstart Passions catch the Government From Reason , and to servitude reduce Man till then free . Therefore since hee permits 90 Within himself unworthie Powers to reign Over free Reason , God in Judgement just Subjects him from without to violent Lords ; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom : Tyrannie must be , Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse . Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low From vertue , which is reason , that no wrong , But Justice , and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie , 100 Thir inward lost : Witness th ’ irreverent Son Of him who built the Ark , who for the shame Don to his Father , heard this heavie curse , Servant Of Servants , on his vitious Race . Thus will this latter , as the former World , Still tend from bad to worse , till God at last Wearied with their iniquities , withdraw His presence from among them , and avert His holy Eyes ; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes ; 110 And one peculiar Nation to select From all the rest , of whom to be invok 'd , A Nation from one faithful man to spring : Him on this side Euphrates yet residing , Bred up in Idol-worship ; O that men ( Canst thou believe ? ) should be so stupid grown , While yet the Patriark liv 'd , who scap 'd the Flood , As to forsake the living God , and fall To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone For Gods ! yet him God the most High voutsafes 120 To call by Vision from his Fathers house , His kindred and false Gods , into a Land Which he will shew him , and from him will raise A mightie Nation , and upon him showre His benediction so , that in his Seed All Nations shall be blest ; hee straight obeys , Not knowing to what Land , yet firm believes : I see him , but thou canst not , with what Faith He leaves his Gods , his Friends , and native Soile Ur of Chaldaea , passing now the Ford 130 To Haran , after him a cumbrous Train Of Herds and Flocks , and numerous servitude ; Not wandring poor , but trusting all his wealth With God , who call 'd him , in a land unknown . Canaan he now attains , I see his Tents Pitcht about Sechem , and the neighbouring Plaine Of Moreb ; there by promise he receaves Gift to his Progenie of all that Land ; From Hamath Northward to the Desert South ( Things by thir names I call , though yet unnam 'd ) 140 From Hermon East to the great Western Sea , Mount Hermon , yonder Sea , each place behold In prospect , as I point them ; on the shoare Mount Carmel ; here the double-founted stream Jordan , true limit Eastward ; but his Sons Shall dwell to Senir , that long ridge of Hills . This ponder , that all Nations of the Earth Shall in his Seed be blessed ; by that Seed Is meant thy great deliverer , who shall bruise The Serpents head ; whereof to thee anon 150 Plainlier shall be reveald . This Patriarch blest , Whom Faithful Abraham due time shall call , A Son , and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves , Like him in faith , in wisdom , and renown ; The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast , departs From Canaan , to a Land hereafter call 'd Egypt , divided by the River Nile ; See where it flows , disgorging at seaven mouthes Into the Sea : to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger Son 160 In time of dearth , a Son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that Realme Of Pharao : there he dies , and leaves his Race Growing into a Nation , and now grown Suspected to a sequent King , who seeks To stop thir overgrowth , as inmate guests Too numerous ; whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably , and kills thir infant Males : Till by two brethren ( those two brethren call Moses and Aaron ) sent from God to claime 170 His people from enthralment , they return With glory and spoile back to thir promis 'd Land . But first the lawless Tyrant , who denies To know thir God , or message to regard , Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire ; To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd , Frogs , Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill With loath 'd intrusion , and fill all the land ; His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die , Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss , 180 And all his people ; Thunder mixt with Haile , Haile mixt with fire must rend th ’ Egyptian Skie And wheel on th ’ Earth , devouring where it rouls ; What it devours not , Herb , or Fruit , or Graine , A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down Must eat , and on the ground leave nothing green : Darkness must overshadow all his bounds , Palpable darkness , and blot out three dayes ; Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born Of Egypt must lie dead . Thus with ten wounds 190 This River-dragon tam 'd at length submits To let his sojourners depart , and oft Humbles his stubborn heart , but still as Ice More hard'nd after thaw , till in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissd , the Sea Swallows him with his Host , but them lets pass As on drie land between two christal walls , Aw 'd by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided , till his rescu 'd gain thir shoar : Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend , 200 Though present in his Angel , who shall goe Before them in a Cloud , and Pillar of Fire , To guide them in thir journey , and remove Behinde them , while th ’ obdurat King pursues : All night he will pursue , but his approach Darkness defends between till morning Watch ; Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud God looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels : when by command Moses once more his potent Rod extends 210 Over the Sea ; the Sea his Rod obeys ; On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return , And overwhelm thir Warr : the Race elect Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance Through the wilde Desert , not the readiest way , Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd Warr terrifie them inexpert , and feare Return them back to Egypt , choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude ; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet 220 Untraind in Armes , where rashness leads not on . This also shall they gain by thir delay In the wide Wilderness , there they shall found Thir government , and thir great Senate choose Through the twelve Tribes , to rule by Laws ordaind : God from the Mount of Sinai , whose gray top Shall tremble , he descending , will himself In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes ; part such as appertaine To civil Justice , part religious Rites 230 Of sacrifice , informing them , by types And shadowes , of that destind Seed to bruise The Serpent , by what meanes he shall achieve Mankinds deliverance . But the voice of God To mortal eare is dreadful ; they beseech That Moses might report to them his will , And terror cease ; he grants them thir desire , Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator , whose high Office now Moses in figure beares , to introduce 240 One greater , of whose day he shall foretell , And all the Prophets in thir Age the times Of great Messiah shall sing . Thus Laws and Rites Establisht , such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will , that he voutsafes Among them to set up his Tabernacle , The holy One with mortal Men to dwell : By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram 'd Of Cedar , overlaid with Gold , therein An Ark , and in the Ark his Testimony , 250 The Records of his Cov'nant , over these A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings Of two bright Cherubim , before him burn Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing The Heav'nly fires ; over the Tent a Cloud Shall rest by Day , a fierie gleame by Night , Save when they journie , and at length they come , Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to Abraham and his Seed : the rest Were long to tell , how many Battels fought , 260 How many Kings destroyd , and Kingdoms won , Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still A day entire , and Nights due course adjourne , Mans voice commanding , Sun in Gibeon stand , And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon , Till Israel overcome ; so call the third From Abraham , Son of Isaac , and from him His whole descent , who thus shall Canaan win . Here Adam interpos 'd . O sent from Heav'n , Enlightner of my darkness , gracious things 270 Thou hast reveald , those chiefly which concerne Just Abraham and his Seed : now first I finde Mine eyes true op'ning , and my heart much eas 'd , Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom Of mee and all Mankind ; but now I see His day , in whom all Nations shall be blest , Favour unmerited by me , who sought Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means . This yet I apprehend not , why to those Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth 280 So many and so various Laws are giv'n ; So many Laws argue so many sins Among them ; how can God with such reside ? To whom thus Michael . Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them , as of thee begot ; And therefore was Law given them to evince Thir natural pravitie , by stirring up Sin against Law to fight ; that when they see Law can discover sin , but not remove , Save by those shadowie expiations weak , 290 The bloud of Bulls and Goats , they may conclude Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man , Just for unjust , that in such righteousness To them by Faith imputed , they may finde Justification towards God , and peace Of Conscience , which the Law by Ceremonies Cannot appease , nor Man the moral part Perform , and not performing cannot live . So Law appears imperfet , and but giv'n With purpose to resign them in full time 300 Up to a better Cov'nant , disciplin 'd From shadowie Types to Truth , from Flesh to Spirit , From imposition of strict Laws , to free Acceptance of large Grace , from servil fear To filial , works of Law to works of Faith . And therefore shall not Moses , though of God Highly belov 'd , being but the Minister Of Law , his people into Canaan lead ; But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call , His Name and Office bearing , who shall quell 310 The adversarie Serpent , and bring back Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest . Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't Long time shall dwell and prosper , but when sins National interrupt thir public peace , Provoking God to raise them enemies : From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first , then under Kings ; of whom The second , both for pietie renownd 320 And puissant deeds , a promise shall receive Irrevocable , that his Regal Throne For ever shall endure ; the like shall sing All Prophecie , That of the Royal Stock Of David ( so I name this King ) shall rise A Son , the Womans Seed to thee foretold , Foretold to Abraham , as in whom shall trust All Nations , and to Kings foretold , of Kings The last , for of his Reign shall be no end . But first a long succession must ensue , 330 And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam 'd , The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents Wandring , shall in a glorious Temple enshrine . Such follow him , as shall be registerd Part good , part bad , of bad the longer scrowle , Whose foul Idolatries , and other faults Heapt to the popular summe , will so incense God , as to leave them , and expose thir Land , Thir Citie , his Temple , and his holy Ark With all his sacred things , a scorn and prey 340 To that proud Citie , whose high Walls thou saw'st Left in confusion , Babylon thence call 'd . There in captivitie he lets them dwell The space of seventie years , then brings them back , Remembring mercie , and his Cov'nant sworn To David , stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n . Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings Thir Lords , whom God dispos 'd , the house of God They first re-edifie , and for a while In mean estate live moderate , till grown 350 In wealth and multitude , factious they grow ; But first among the Priests dissension springs , Men who attend the Altar , and should most Endeavour Peace : thir strife pollution brings Upon the Temple it self : at last they seise The Scepter , and regard not Davids Sons , Then loose it to a stranger , that the true Anointed King Messiah might be born Barr 'd of his right ; yet at his Birth a Starr Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com , 360 And guides the Eastern Sages , who enquire His place , to offer Incense , Myrrh , and Gold ; His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple Shepherds , keeping watch by night ; They gladly thither haste , and by a Quire Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung . A Virgin is his Mother , but his Sire The Power of the most High ; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie , and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds , his glory with the Heav'ns . 370 He ceas 'd , discerning Adam with such joy Surcharg 'd , as had like grief bin dew 'd in tears , Without the vent of words , which these he breathd . O Prophet of glad tidings , finisher Of utmost hope ! now clear I understand What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain , Why our great expectation should be call 'd The seed of Woman : Virgin Mother , Haile , High in the love of Heav'n , yet from my Loynes Thou shalt proceed , and from thy Womb the Son 380 Of God most High ; So God with man unites . Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise Expect with mortal paine : say where and when Thir fight , what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel . To whom thus Michael . Dream not of thir fight , As of a Duel , or the local wounds Of head or heel : not therefore joynes the Son Manhood to God-head , with more strength to foil Thy enemie ; nor so is overcome Satan , whose fall from Heav'n , a deadlier bruise , 390 Disabl 'd not to give thee thy deaths wound : Which hee , who comes thy Saviour , shall recure , Not by destroying Satan , but his works In thee and in thy Seed : nor can this be , But by fulfilling that which thou didst want , Obedience to the Law of God , impos 'd On penaltie of death , and suffering death , The penaltie to thy transgression due , And due to theirs which out of thine will grow : So onely can high Justice rest appaid . 400 The Law of God exact he shall fulfill Both by obedience and by love , though love Alone fulfill the Law ; thy punishment He shall endure by coming in the Flesh To a reproachful life and cursed death , Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe In his redemption , and that his obedience Imputed becomes theirs by Faith , his merits To save them , not thir own , though legal works . For this he shall live hated , be blasphem 'd , 410 Seis 'd on by force , judg 'd , and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst , naild to the Cross By his own Nation , slaine for bringing Life ; But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies , The Law that is against thee , and the sins Of all mankinde , with him there crucifi 'd , Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction ; so he dies , But soon revives , Death over him no power Shall long usurp ; ere the third dawning light 420 Returne , the Starres of Morn shall see him rise Out of his grave , fresh as the dawning light , Thy ransom paid , which Man from death redeems , His death for Man , as many as offerd Life Neglect not , and the benefit imbrace By Faith not void of works : this God-like act Annuls thy doom , the death thou shouldst have dy 'd , In sin for ever lost from life ; this act Shall bruise the head of Satan , crush his strength Defeating Sin and Death , his two maine armes , 430 And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel , Or theirs whom he redeems , a death like sleep , A gentle wafting to immortal Life . Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer To his Disciples , Men who in his Life Still follow 'd him ; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learn 'd And his Salvation , them who shall beleeve 440 Baptizing in the profluent streame , the signe Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life Pure , and in mind prepar 'd , if so befall , For death , like that which the redeemer dy 'd . All Nations they shall teach ; for from that day Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines Salvation shall be Preacht , but to the Sons Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world ; So in his seed all Nations shall be blest . Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend 450 With victory , triumphing through the aire Over his foes and thine ; there shall surprise The Serpent , Prince of aire , and drag in Chaines Through all his realme , &amp; there confounded leave ; Then enter into glory , and resume His Seat at Gods right hand , exalted high Above all names in Heav'n ; and thence shall come , When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe , With glory and power to judge both quick &amp; dead , To judge th ’ unfaithful dead , but to reward 460 His faithful , and receave them into bliss , Whether in Heav'n or Earth , for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise , far happier place Then this of Eden , and far happier daies . So spake th ’ Archangel Michael , then paus 'd , As at the Worlds great period ; and our Sire Replete with joy and wonder thus repli 'd . O goodness infinite , goodness immense ! That all this good of evil shall produce , And evil turn to good ; more wonderful 470 Then that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness ! full of doubt I stand , Whether I should repent me now of sin By mee done and occasiond , or rejoyce Much more , that much more good thereof shall spring , To God more glory , more good will to Men From God , and over wrauth grace shall abound . But say , if our deliverer up to Heav'n Must reascend , what will betide the few His faithful , left among th ’ unfaithful herd , 480 The enemies of truth ; who then shall guide His people , who defend ? will they not deale Wors with his followers then with him they dealt ? Be sure they will , said th ’ Angel ; but from Heav'n Hee to his own a Comforter will send , The promise of the Father , who shall dwell His Spirit within them , and the Law of Faith Working through love , upon thir hearts shall write , To guide them in all truth , and also arme With spiritual Armour , able to resist 490 Satans assaults , and quench his fierie darts What Man can do against them , not affraid , Though to the death , against such cruelties With inward consolations recompenc't , And oft supported so as shall amaze Thir proudest persecuters : for the Spirit Powrd first on his Apostles , whom he sends To evangelize the Nations , then on all Baptiz 'd , shall them with wondrous gifts endue To speak all Tongues , and do all Miracles , 500 As did thir Lord before them . Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n : at length Thir Ministry perform 'd , and race well run , Thir doctrine and thir story written left , They die ; but in thir room , as they forewarne , Wolves shall succeed for teachers , grievous Wolves , Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition , and the truth 510 With superstitions and traditions taint , Left onely in those written Records pure , Though not but by the Spirit understood . Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names , Places and titles , and with these to joine Secular power , though feigning still to act By spiritual , to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God , promisd alike and giv'n To all Beleevers ; and from that pretense , Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force 520 On every conscience ; Laws which none shall finde Left them inrould , or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave . What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace it self , and binde His consort Libertie ; what , but unbuild His living Temples , built by Faith to stand , Thir own Faith not anothers : for on Earth Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible ? yet many will presume : Whence heavie persecution shall arise 530 On all who in the worship persevere Of Spirit and Truth ; the rest , farr greater part , Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes Religion satisfi 'd ; Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts , and works of Faith Rarely be found : so shall the World goe on , To good malignant , to bad men benigne , Under her own waight groaning , till the day Appeer of respiration to the just , And vengeance to the wicked , at return 540 Of him so lately promis 'd to thy aid , The Womans seed , obscurely then foretold , Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord , Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald In glory of the Father , to dissolve Satan with his perverted World , then raise From the conflagrant mass , purg 'd and refin 'd , New Heav'ns , new Earth , Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love , To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss . 550 He ended ; and thus Adam last reply 'd . How soon hath thy prediction , Seer blest , Measur 'd this transient World , the Race of time , Till time stand fixt : beyond is all abyss , Eternitie , whose end no eye can reach . Greatly instructed I shall hence depart , Greatly in peace of thought , and have my fill Of knowledge , what this vessel can containe ; Beyond which was my folly to aspire . Henceforth I learne , that to obey is best , 560 And love with feare the onely God , to walk As in his presence , ever to observe His providence , and on him sole depend , Merciful over all his works , with good Still overcoming evil , and by small Accomplishing great things , by things deemd weak Subverting worldly strong , and worldly wise By simply meek ; that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie , And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life ; 570 Taught this by his example whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest . To whom thus also th ’ Angel last repli 'd : This having learnt , thou hast attaind the summe Of wisdom ; hope no higher , though all the Starrs Thou knewst by name , and all th ’ ethereal Powers , All secrets of the deep , all Natures works , Or works of God in Heav'n , Air , Earth , or Sea , And all the riches of this World enjoydst , And all the rule , one Empire ; onely add 580 Deeds to thy knowledge answerable , add Faith , Add Vertue , Patience , Temperance , add Love , By name to come call 'd Charitie , the soul Of all the rest : then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise , but shalt possess A Paradise within thee , happier farr . Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation ; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence ; and see the Guards , By mee encampt on yonder Hill , expect 590 Thir motion , at whose Front a flaming Sword , In signal of remove , waves fiercely round ; We may no longer stay : go , waken Eve ; Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm 'd Portending good , and all her spirits compos 'd To meek submission : thou at season fit Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard , Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know , The great deliverance by her Seed to come ( For by the Womans Seed ) on all Mankind . 600 That ye may live , which will be many dayes , Both in one Faith unanimous though sad , With cause for evils past , yet much more cheer 'd With meditation on the happie end . He ended , and they both descend the Hill ; Descended , Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before , but found her wak't ; And thus with words not sad she him receav 'd . Whence thou returnst , &amp; whither wentst , I know ; For God is also in sleep , and Dreams advise , 610 Which he hath sent propitious , some great good Presaging , since with sorrow and hearts distress Wearied I fell asleep : but now lead on ; In mee is no delay ; with thee to goe , Is to stay here ; without thee here to stay , Is to go hence unwilling ; thou to mee Art all things under Heav'n , all places thou , Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence . This further consolation yet secure I carry hence ; though all by mee is lost , 620 Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft , By mee the Promis 'd Seed shall all restore . So spake our Mother Eve , and Adam heard Well pleas 'd , but answer 'd not ; for now too nigh Th ’ Archangel stood , and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station , all in bright array The Cherubim descended ; on the ground Gliding meteorous , as Ev'ning Mist Ris'n from a River o 're the marish glides , And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel 630 Homeward returning . High in Front advanc't , The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz 'd Fierce as a Comet ; which with torrid heat , And vapour as the Libyan Air adust , Began to parch that temperate Clime ; whereat In either hand the hastning Angel caught Our lingring Parents , and to th ’ Eastern Gate Let them direct , and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plaine ; then disappeer 'd . They looking back , all th ’ Eastern side beheld 640 Of Paradise , so late thir happie seat , Wav 'd over by that flaming Brand , the Gate With dreadful Faces throng 'd and fierie Armes : Som natural tears they drop 'd , but wip 'd them soon ; The World was all before them , where to choose Thir place of rest , and Providence thir guide : They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow , Through Eden took thir solitarie way .
