  <body>
   <p>THE AUTHOR 'S PREFACE TO THE SECOND BOOK OF THESE TALES</p>
   <p>These are the last works of this style that will come from the pen of the Author , and consequently this is the last opportunity he has of vindicating the boldness and privilege which he has assumed . We make no mention of villainous rhymes , of lines that run into the next , of two vowels without elision , nor , in general , of such kinds of carelessness as he would not allow himself in another style of poetry , but which are part and parcel , so to say , of this style . Too anxious a care in avoiding such would force a tale-writer into a labyrinth of shifts , into narratives as dull as they are grand , into straits that are utterly useless , and would make him disregard the pleasure of the heart in order to labour for the gratification of the ear . We must leave studied narrative for lofty subjects , and not compose an epic poem of the Adventures of Renaud d'Ast . Suppose the Author , who has put these tales into rhyme , had brought to bear on them all the care and preciseness required of him ; not only would this care be observed , especially as it is unnecessary , but it would also transgress the precept lain down by Ouintilian , still the Author would not have attained the main object , which is to interest the reader , to charm him , to rivet his attention in spite of himself ,— in a word , to please him . As everybody knows , the secret of pleasing the reader is not always based on regulation , nor even on symmetry ; there is need of smartness and tastefulness , if we would strike home . How many of those perfect types of beauty do we see which never strike home , and of which nobody feels enamoured ! We do not wish to rob Modern Authors of the praise that is due to them . Nicely turned lines , fine language , accuracy , elegance of rhyme are accomplishments in a poet . However that may be , let us consider of our own epigrams wherein all these qualities are combined , perhaps we shall find in them far less point , nay , I would venture to add , far less charm than in those of Marot or Saint-Gelais , although almost all the works of the latter poets are full of the same faults as are attributed to us . We will be told that these were not faults in their day , whereas they are very great faults in ours . To this we answer by a similar kind of argument , by saying , as we have already said , that these would undoubtedly be faults in another style of poetry , but not in this . The late M. de Voiture is a proof in point . We need only read the works in which he brings to life again the character of Marot . For our Author does not lay claim to praise for himself , nor to rounds of applause from the public for having put a few tales into rhyme . Without doubt he has entered on quite a new path , and has pursued it to the utmost of his power , choosing now one road , now another , and always treading with surer step when he has followed the manner of our old poets “ quorum in hae re imitari negligentiam exoptat potius quam istorum diligentiam . ”</p>
   <p>But while saying that we wished to waive this question , we have unconsciously involved ourselves in its discussion . Perhaps this has not been without advantage ; for there is nothing that resembles faults more than these licenses . Let us now consider the liberty which the Author has assumed in cutting into the property of others as well as his own , without making exception even to the best known stories , none of which he scruples to tamper with . He curtails , enlarges , and alters incidents and details , at times the main issue and the sequel ; in short , the story is no longer the same ; it is , in point of fact , quite a new tale ; its original author would find it no small difficulty to recognise in it his own work . “ Non sic decet contaminari fabulas , ” Critics will say . Why should they not ? They twitted Terence in just the same way ; but Terence sneered at them , and claimed a right to treat the matter as he did . He has mingled his own ideas with the subjects he drew from Menander , just as Sophocles and Euripides mingled theirs with the subjects they drew from former writers , sparing neither history nor romance , where “ decorum ” and the rules of the Drama were at issue . Shall this privilege cease with respect to fictitious stories ? Must we in future have more scrupulous or religious regard , if we may be allowed the expression , for falsehood than the Ancients had for truth ? What people call a good tale never passes from hand to hand without receiving some fresh touch of embellishment . How comes it then , we may be asked , that in many passages the Author curtails instead of enlarging on the original ? On that point we are agreed : the Author does so in order to avoid lengthiness and ambiguity ,— two faults which are inadmissible in such matters , especially the latter . For if lucidity is to be commended in all literary works , we may say that it is especially necessary in narratives , where one thing is , as a rule , the sequel and the result of another ; where the less important sometimes lays the basis of the more important ; so that , once the thread becomes broken , the reader cannot gather it up again . Besides , as narratives in verse are very awkward , the author must clog himself with details as little as possible ; by means of this you relieve not only yourself , but also the reader , for whom an author should not fail to prepare pleasure unalloyed . Whenever the Author has altered a few particulars and even a few catastrophes , he has been forced to do so by the cause of that catastrophe and the urgency of giving it a happy termination . He has fancied that in tales of this kind everyone ought to be satisfied with the end : it pleases the reader at any rate , if the author has not given the characters too distasteful a rendering . But he must not go so far as that , if possible , nor make the reader laugh and cry in the same tale . This medley shocks Horace above all things ; his wish is not that our works should border on the grotesque , and that we should draw a picture half woman half fish . These are the general motives the Author has had in view . We might still quote special motives and vindicate each point ; but we must needs leave something to the capacity and leniency of our readers . They will be satisfied , then , with the motives we have mentioned . We would have stated them more clearly and have set more by them , had the general compass of a Preface so allowed .</p>

    <head>FRIAR PHILIP 'S GEESE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IF these gay tales give pleasure to the FAIR ,</l>
     <l n="2">The honour 's great conferred , I 'm well aware ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet , why suppose the sex my pages shun ?</l>
     <l n="4">Enough , if they condemn where follies run ;</l>
     <l n="5">Laugh in their sleeve at tricks they disapprove ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , false or true , a muscle never move .</l>
     <l n="7">A playful jest can scarcely give offence :</l>
     <l n="8">Who knows too much , oft shows a want of sense .</l>
     <l n="9">From flatt'ry oft more dire effects arise ,</l>
     <l n="10">Enflame the heart and take it by surprise ;</l>
     <l n="11">Ye beauteous belles , beware each sighing swain ,</l>
     <l n="12">Discard his vows :— my book with care retain ;</l>
     <l n="13">Your safety then I 'll guarantee at ease .—</l>
     <l n="14">But why dismiss ?— their wishes are to please :</l>
     <l n="15">And , truly , no necessity appears</l>
     <l n="16">For solitude :— consider well your years .</l>
     <l n="17">I HAVE , and feel convinced they do you wrong ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who think no virtue can to such belong ;</l>
     <l n="19">White crows and phoenixes do not abound ;</l>
     <l n="20">But lucky lovers still are sometimes found ;</l>
     <l n="21">And though , as these famed birds , not quite so rare ,</l>
     <l n="22">The numbers are not great that favours share ;</l>
     <l n="23">I own my works a diff'rent sense express ,</l>
     <l n="24">But these are tales :— mere tales in easy dress .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">To beauty 's wiles , in ev'ry class , I 've bowed ;</l>
     <l n="26">Fawned , flattered , sighed , e'en constancy have vowed</l>
     <l n="27">What gained ? you ask — but little I admit ;</l>
     <l n="28">Howe'er we aim , too oft we fail to hit .</l>
     <l n="29">My latter days I 'll now devote with care ,</l>
     <l n="30">To guard the sex from ev'ry latent snare .</l>
     <l n="31">Tales I 'll detail , and these relate at ease :</l>
     <l n="32">Narrations clear and neat will always please ;</l>
     <l n="33">Like me , to this attention criticks pay ;</l>
     <l n="34">Then sleep , on either side , from night till day .</l>
     <l n="35">If awkward , vulgar phrase intervene ,</l>
     <l n="36">Or rhymes imperfect o'er the page be seen ,</l>
     <l n="37">Condemn at will ; but stratagems and art ,</l>
     <l n="38">Pass , shut your eyes , who 'd heed the idle part ?</l>
     <l n="39">Some mothers , husbands , may perhaps be led ,</l>
     <l n="40">To pull my locks for stories white or red ;</l>
     <l n="41">So matters stand : a fine affair , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="42">And what I 've failed to do — my book makes out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="43">THE FAIR my pages safely may pursue ,</l>
     <l n="44">And this apology they 'll not refuse .</l>
     <l n="45">What recompense can I presume to make ?</l>
     <l n="46">A tale I 'll give , where female charms partake ,</l>
     <l n="47">And prove resistless whatsoe'er assail :</l>
     <l n="48">Blessed BEAUTY , NATURE ever should prevail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">HAD Fate decreed our YOUTH , at early morn ,</l>
     <l n="50">To view the angel features you adorn ,</l>
     <l n="51">The captivating pow'rs AURORA bless ,</l>
     <l n="52">Or airy SPRING bedecked in beauteous dress ,</l>
     <l n="53">And all the azure canopy on high</l>
     <l n="54">Had vanished like a dream , once you were nigh .</l>
     <l n="55">And when his eyes at length your charms beheld ,</l>
     <l n="56">His glowing breast with softest passion swelled ;</l>
     <l n="57">Superior lustre beamed at ev'ry view ;</l>
     <l n="58">No pleasures pleased : his soul was fixed on you .</l>
     <l n="59">Crowns , jewels , palaces , appeared as naught .</l>
     <l n="60">‘ Twas solely beauteous woman now he sought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="61">A WOOD , from earliest years , his home had been ,</l>
     <l n="62">And birds the only company he 'd seen ,</l>
     <l n="63">Whose notes harmonious often lulled his care ,</l>
     <l n="64">Beguiled his hours , and saved him from despair ;</l>
     <l n="65">Delightful sounds ! from nightingale and dove</l>
     <l n="66">Unknown their tongue , yet indicant of love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="67">THIS savage , solitary , rustick school ,</l>
     <l n="68">The father chose his infancy to rule .</l>
     <l n="69">The mother 's recent death induced the sire ,</l>
     <l n="70">To place the son where only beasts retire ;</l>
     <l n="71">And long the forest habitants alone</l>
     <l n="72">Were all his youthful sight had ever known .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="73">TWO reasons , good or bad , the father led</l>
     <l n="74">To fly the world :— all intercourse to dread</l>
     <l n="75">Since fate had torn his lovely spouse from hence ;</l>
     <l n="76">Misanthropy and fear o'ercame each sense ;</l>
     <l n="77">Of the world grown tired , he hated all around :—</l>
     <l n="78">Too oft in solitude is sorrow found .</l>
     <l n="79">His partner 's death produced distaste of life ,</l>
     <l n="80">And made him fear to seek another wife .</l>
     <l n="81">A hermit 's gloomy , mossy cell he took ,</l>
     <l n="82">And wished his child might thither solely look .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="83">AMONG the poor his little wealth he threw ,</l>
     <l n="84">And with his infant son alone withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="85">The forest 's dreary wilds concealed his cell ;</l>
     <l n="86">There Philip ( such his name ) resolved to dwell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="87">BY holy motives led , and not chagrin ,</l>
     <l n="88">The hermit never spoke of what he 'd seen ;</l>
     <l n="89">But , from the youth 's discernment , strove to hide ,</l>
     <l n="90">Whate'er regarded love , and much beside ,</l>
     <l n="91">The softer sex , with all their magick charms ,</l>
     <l n="92">That fill the feeling bosom with alarms .</l>
     <l n="93">As years advanced , the boy with care he taught ;</l>
     <l n="94">What suited best his age before him brought ;</l>
     <l n="95">At five he showed him animals and flow'rs ,</l>
     <l n="96">The birds of air , the beasts , their sev'ral pow'rs ;</l>
     <l n="97">And now and then of hell he gave a hint ,</l>
     <l n="98">Old Satan 's wrath , and what might awe imprint ,</l>
     <l n="99">How formed , and doomed to infamy below ;</l>
     <l n="100">In childhood FEAR ‘ s the lesson first we know !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="101">THE years had passed away , when Philip tried ,</l>
     <l n="102">In matters more profound his son to guide ;</l>
     <l n="103">He spoke of Paradise and Heav'n above ;</l>
     <l n="104">But not a word of woman ,— nor of LOVE .</l>
     <l n="105">Fifteen arrived , the sire with anxious care ,</l>
     <l n="106">Of NATURE 'S works declaimed ,— but not the FAIR :</l>
     <l n="107">An age , when those , for solitude designed ,</l>
     <l n="108">Should be to scenes of seriousness confined ,</l>
     <l n="109">Nor joys of youth , nor soft ideas praised</l>
     <l n="110">The flame soon spreads when Cupid 's torch is raised .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="111">AT length , when twenty summers time had run ,</l>
     <l n="112">The father to the city brought his son ;</l>
     <l n="113">With years weighed down , the hermit scarcely knew</l>
     <l n="114">His daily course of duty to pursue ;</l>
     <l n="115">And when Death 's venomed shaft should on him fall ;</l>
     <l n="116">On whom could then his boy for succour call ?</l>
     <l n="117">How life support , unknowing and unknown ?</l>
     <l n="118">Wolves , foxes , bears , ne'er charity have shown ;</l>
     <l n="119">And all the sire could give his darling care ,</l>
     <l n="120">A staff and wallet , he was well aware</l>
     <l n="121">Fine patrimony , truly , for a child !</l>
     <l n="122">To which his mind was no way reconciled .</l>
     <l n="123">Bread few , ‘ twas clear , the hermit would deny ,</l>
     <l n="124">And rich he might have been you may rely ;</l>
     <l n="125">When he drew near , the children quickly cried</l>
     <l n="126">Here 's father Philip — haste , the alms provide ;</l>
     <l n="127">And many pious men his friends were found ,</l>
     <l n="128">But not one female devotee around :</l>
     <l n="129">None would he hear ; the FAIR he always fled</l>
     <l n="130">Their smiles and wiles the friar kept in dread .</l>

     <l n="134">How food to beg , and other ways discern .</l>
     <l n="135">In tears he viewed his son the forest quit ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="137">THE city 's palaces and lofty spires ,</l>

     <l n="141">What 's here ? said he ; The court , his friends replied :—</l>

     <l n="32">And begged the names he would not from her hide ,</l>
     <l n="33">With all particulars , from first to last :—</l>
     <l n="34">Her ardent wish to know whate'er had passed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">SO long your reign , said Richard , o'er my mind ,</l>
     <l n="36">Deny I could not , howsoe'er inclined ;</l>
     <l n="37">With Mrs. Simon often is your spouse ;</l>
     <l n="38">Her character no doubt your spleen will rouse ;</l>
     <l n="39">I 've no design , observe to give offence ,</l>
     <l n="40">But , when I see your int'rest in suspense ,</l>
     <l n="41">I cannot silent keep ; though , were I still</l>
     <l n="42">A slave , devoted wholly to your will ,</l>
     <l n="43">As late I moved , I would not drop a word</l>
     <l n="44">Mistrust of lovers may not be absurd ;</l>
     <l n="45">Besides , you 'd fancy other motives led</l>
     <l n="46">To tell you of your husband what was said ;</l>
     <l n="47">But heav'n be praised , of you I nothing want ;</l>
     <l n="48">My object 's plain — no more the fond gallant .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">I 'VE lately certain information had ,</l>
     <l n="50">Your spouse ( I scarcely thought the man so bad ,)</l>
     <l n="51">Has with the lady an appointment made ;</l>
     <l n="52">At Jack 's nice bagnio he will meet the jade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">NOW clearly Jack 's not rich , and there 's no doubt ;</l>
     <l n="54">A hundred ducats give , and — ALL will out ;</l>
     <l n="55">Let him but have a handsome sum in view ,</l>
     <l n="56">And any thing you wish , be sure he 'll do ;</l>
     <l n="57">You then can manage ev'ry way so well ,</l>
     <l n="58">That , at the place assigned to meet his belle ,</l>
     <l n="59">You 'll take this truant husband by surprise ;—</l>
     <l n="60">Permit me in this nice affair to advise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="61">THE lady has agreed , you will remark ,</l>
     <l n="62">That in a room where ev'ry part is dark ,</l>
     <l n="63">( Perhaps to ‘ scape the keeper 's prying sight ,</l>
     <l n="64">Or shame directs exclusion of the light ,)</l>
     <l n="65">She will receive your gay inconstant spouse ;</l>
     <l n="66">Now , take her place ; the case deceit allows ;</l>
     <l n="67">Make Jack your friend ; nor haggle at the price ;</l>
     <l n="68">A hundred ducats give , is my advice ;</l>
     <l n="69">He 'll place you in the room where darkness reigns ;</l>
     <l n="70">Think not too fast , nor suffer heavy chains ;</l>
     <l n="71">Do what you wish , and utter not a word ;</l>
     <l n="72">To speak , assuredly would be absurd ;</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Twould spoil the whole ; destroy the project quite ;</l>
     <l n="74">Attend , and see if all things be not right .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="75">THE project pleased Catella to the soul ;</l>
     <l n="76">Her wrath , no longer able to controul ,</l>
     <l n="77">She Richard stopt ; enough , enough , she cried ;</l>
     <l n="78">I fully understand :— leave me to guide ;</l>
     <l n="79">I 'll play the fellow and his wanton lass</l>
     <l n="80">A pretty trick-shall all their art surpass ,</l>
     <l n="81">Unless the string gives way and spoils my scheme ;</l>
     <l n="82">What , take me for a nincompoop ?— they dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="83">THIS said , she sought excuse to get away ,</l>
     <l n="84">And went in quest of Jack without delay .</l>
     <l n="85">The keeper , howsoe'er , a hint had got ;</l>
     <l n="86">Minutolo had schooled him for the plot ;</l>
     <l n="87">Oft cash does wonders , and , if such the case</l>
     <l n="88">In France or Britain , when conferred a grace ,</l>
     <l n="89">The bribe is taken , and the truth abused ,</l>
     <l n="90">In Italy it will not be refused ;</l>
     <l n="91">There this sole quiver Cupid useful finds ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="92">A purse well stored — all binds , gunlocks , or blinds :</l>
     <l n="93">Jack took the pelf from Richard and the dame ;</l>
     <l n="94">Had Satan offered — ‘ twould have been the same .</l>
     <l n="95">In short , Minutolo had full success ,</l>
     <l n="96">All came about , and marked the spark 's address .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="97">THE lady had at first some warm dispute</l>
     <l n="98">To many questions Jack was even mute ;</l>
     <l n="99">But when he saw the golden charms unmasked ,</l>
     <l n="100">Far more he promised than Catella asked .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="101">THE time of rendezvous arrived , our spark</l>
     <l n="102">To Jack 's repaired , and found the room quite dark ;</l>
     <l n="103">So well arranged , no crevice could he find ,</l>
     <l n="104">Through which the light might hurt what he designed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="105">NOT long he waited , ere our jealous dame ,</l>
     <l n="106">Who longed to find her faithless husband , came ,</l>
     <l n="107">Most thoroughly prepared his ears to greet .</l>
     <l n="108">Jack brought the couple presently to meet .</l>
     <l n="109">The lady found , howe'er , not what she sought :</l>
     <l n="110">No guilty spouse , nor Mrs. Simon caught ;</l>
     <l n="111">But wily Richard , who , without alarms ,</l>
     <l n="112">In silence took Catella in his arms .</l>
     <l n="113">What further passed between the easy pair ,</l>
     <l n="114">Think what you will , I mean not to declare ;</l>
     <l n="115">The lover certainly received delight</l>
     <l n="116">The lady showed no terror nor affright ;</l>
     <l n="117">On neither side a syllable was dropt</l>
     <l n="118">With care Minutolo his laughter stopt ;</l>
     <l n="119">Though difficult , our spark succeeded well ;</l>
     <l n="120">No words of mine can Richard 's pleasure tell .</l>
     <l n="121">His fav'rite beauteous belle he now possessed ,</l>
     <l n="122">And triumphed where so oft he 'd been repressed ,</l>
     <l n="123">Yet fondly hoped her pardon he should get ,</l>
     <l n="124">Since they together had so gaily met .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="125">AT length , the fair could no longer contain :</l>
     <l n="126">Vile wretch , she cried , I 've borne too much ‘ tis plain ;</l>
     <l n="127">I 'm not the fav'rite whom thou had'st in view :</l>
     <l n="128">To tear thy eyes out justly were thy due ,</l>
     <l n="129">‘ Tis this , indeed , that makes thee silent keep ,</l>
     <l n="130">Each morn feign sickness , and pretend to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="131">Thyself reserving doubtless for amours :—</l>
     <l n="132">Speak , villain ! say , of charms have I less stores ?</l>
     <l n="133">Or what has Mrs. Simon more than I ?</l>
     <l n="134">A wanton wench , in tricks so wondrous sly !</l>
     <l n="135">Where my love less ? though truly now I hate ;</l>
     <l n="136">Would that I 'd seen thee hung , thou wretch ingrate !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="137">MINUTOLO , while thus Catella spoke ,</l>
     <l n="138">Caressed her much , but silence never broke ;</l>
     <l n="139">A kiss e'en tried to gain , without success ;</l>
     <l n="140">She struggled , and refused to acquiesce ;</l>
     <l n="141">Begone ! said she , nor treat me like a child ;</l>
     <l n="142">Stand off !— away !— thy taction is defiled ;</l>
     <l n="143">My tears express an injured woman 's grief ;</l>
     <l n="144">No more thy wife I 'll be , but seek relief ;</l>
     <l n="145">Return my fortune — go :— thy mistress seek ;</l>
     <l n="146">To be so constant :— How was I so weak ?</l>
     <l n="147">It surely would be nothing more than right ,</l>
     <l n="148">Were Richard I to see this very night ,</l>
     <l n="149">Who adoration constantly has paid :—</l>
     <l n="150">You much deserve to be a cuckold made ;</l>
     <l n="151">I 'm half inclined , I vow , to do the worst .</l>
     <l n="152">At this our arch gallant with laughter burst .</l>
     <l n="153">What impudence !— You mock me too ? she cried</l>
     <l n="154">Let 's see , with blushes if his face be dyed ?</l>
     <l n="155">When from his arms she sprang , a window sought ;</l>
     <l n="156">The shutters ope 'd , and then a view she caught ;</l>
     <l n="157">Minutolo , her lover ! * * * what surprise !</l>
     <l n="158">Pale , faint , she instant grew , and closed her eyes :</l>
     <l n="159">Who would have thought , said she , thou wert so base ?</l>
     <l n="160">I 'm lost ! * * * for ever sunk in dire disgrace !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="161">WHO 'LL , know it ? Richard earnestly replied ;</l>
     <l n="162">In Jack 's concealment we may both confide ;</l>
     <l n="163">Excuse the trick I 've played and ne'er repine ;</l>
     <l n="164">Address , force , treachery , in love combine ;</l>
     <l n="165">All are permitted when intrigue ‘ s the word ;</l>
     <l n="166">To hold the contrary were quite absurd .</l>
     <l n="167">Till stratagem was used I naught could gain ,</l>
     <l n="168">But looks and darts from eyes , for all my pain .</l>
     <l n="169">I 've paid myself ;— Would you have done it ?— No ;</l>
     <l n="170">‘ Tis all as might be wished ;— come , smiles bestow ;</l>
     <l n="171">I 'm satisfied , the fault was not with you .</l>
     <l n="172">In this , to make you wretched , naught I view ;</l>
     <l n="173">Why sigh and groan ?— What numbers could I name ,</l>
     <l n="174">Who would be happy to be served the same .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="175">HIS reas'ning yet could not the belle appease ;</l>
     <l n="176">She wept , and sought by tears her mind to ease ;</l>
     <l n="177">Affliction highly added to her charms ;</l>
     <l n="178">Minutolo still gave her new alarms ;</l>
     <l n="179">He took her hand , which she at once withdrew :</l>
     <l n="180">Away , she cried ; no longer me pursue ;</l>
     <l n="181">Be satisfied ; you surely do n't desire</l>
     <l n="182">That I assistance from the house require ,</l>
     <l n="183">Or rouse the neighbours with my plaintive cries</l>
     <l n="184">I 'll ev'ry thing declare without disguise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="185">SUCH folly do n't commit , replied the spark ;</l>
     <l n="186">Your wisest plan is nothing to remark :</l>
     <l n="187">The world at present is become so vile ,</l>
     <l n="188">If you the truth divulge , they 'll only smile ;</l>
     <l n="189">Not one a word of treachery would believe ,</l>
     <l n="190">But think you came — and money to receive :</l>
     <l n="191">Suppose , besides , it reached your husband 's ears ;</l>
     <l n="192">Th ’ effect has reason to excite your fears ;</l>
     <l n="193">‘ Twould give displeasure and occasion strife :</l>
     <l n="194">Would you in duels wish to risk his life ?</l>
     <l n="195">Whatever makes you with him disagree ,</l>
     <l n="196">At all events , I 'm full as bad as he .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="197">THESE reasons with Catella greatly weighed</l>
     <l n="198">Since things , continued he , are thus displayed ;</l>
     <l n="199">And cannot be repaired , console your mind ;</l>
     <l n="200">A perfect being never was designed .</l>
     <l n="201">If , howsoe'er you will * * * but say no more ;</l>
     <l n="202">Such thoughts for ever banish , I implore .</l>
     <l n="203">‘ Mid all my perseverance , zeal , and art ,</l>
     <l n="204">I nothing got but frowns that pierced the heart :</l>
     <l n="205">‘ Twill now on you depend if pleasure prove</l>
     <l n="206">This day imperfect , ere from hence we move .</l>
     <l n="207">What more remains to do ? the worst is past ;</l>
     <l n="208">‘ Tis step the first that costs , however classed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="209">So well Minutolo preferred his suit ,</l>
     <l n="210">The lady with him more would not dispute ,</l>
     <l n="211">With downcast eyes she listened to his prayer ,</l>
     <l n="212">And looked disposed to tranquilize his care ;</l>
     <l n="213">From easy freedom soon he ‘ gan to soar ;</l>
     <l n="214">A smile received :— a kiss bestowed and more :</l>
     <l n="215">At length , the lady passed resistance by ,</l>
     <l n="216">And all conceded , e'en without a sigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="217">OUR hero felt a thousand times more blessed</l>
     <l n="218">Than when he first the beauteous fair caressed ;</l>
     <l n="219">For when a flame reciprocal is raised ,</l>
     <l n="220">The bliss redoubles , and by all is praised .</l>
