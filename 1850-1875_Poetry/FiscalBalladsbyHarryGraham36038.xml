    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="1">I 'm only a common workin ’ - man , With a eye to my vittles an ’ beer , But afore I puts my money on Joe , There 's a thing or two as I 'd like to know , Which ‘ e ‘ as n't a-made quite clear .</p>
    <p n="2">I admit as it sounds attractive-like For to shut them furriners out , But every Board School nipper knows As there 's things wot only a furriner grows As we could n't well do without .</p>
    <p n="3">There 's sugar , an ’ rice , an ’ cocoa-nibs , There 's cawfy an ’ tea as well , As we never could raise , suppose we tried , And we ‘ as to buy ‘ em somewheres outside , And the furriners ‘ as to sell .</p>
    <p n="4">But they do n't give nothin ’ for nothink — Which you can n't dispute the fac ’ — An ’ we 're sending ‘ em hevery bit as much Of our cotton-goods , an ’ our coal , an ’ such , As ‘ ll pay the beggars back .</p>
    <p n="5">An ’ the less we buys o ’ them furrin goods , The less of our own 's returned ; Which it 's plain to see as the more they take , The more our firms ‘ as a chance to make , An ’ the ‘ igher the wages earned .</p>
    <p n="6">For it 's British Labour as pays the price O ’ them goods as crosses the sea , An ’ suppose as the furrin imports fail , It 's the case of a empty dinner-pail For the workin ’ - man like me .</p>
    <p n="7">Let the furriner send ‘ is foodstuffs in — Lor ’ bless you , I ai n't afraid ! For the more we markets with other lands , The more employment for British ‘ ands , An ’ the better for British trade !</p>
    <p n="8">I ‘ as n't no love for the German man , Nor yet for the ‘ eathen Turk , But I ai n't a fool as ‘ ll shut the door In the face of even a blooming Boer , If the beggar can give me work .</p>
    <p n="9">For it 's work I wants , an ’ it 's wages too , An ’ I 'm lookin ’ afore I leap ; I wo n't go chucking a job away , On the chance of a possible rise o ’ pay , While food 's to be ‘ ad so cheap .</p>
    <p n="10">I 'm only a workin ’ artisan , But the truth I 'd like to know ; I ai n't for takin ’ no risks , myself , Of a empty grate an ’ a empty shelf — No , thanks , sir , not for Joe !</p>
    <p n="11">‘ E says as ‘ e 'll ‘ sweep the Country ’ ! And ‘ e 'll do it too , maybe ; If the workin ’ - men do n't ‘ ave a care , They 'll find as there ai n't no Country there , When ‘ e 's swep ’ it — into the sea !</p>
