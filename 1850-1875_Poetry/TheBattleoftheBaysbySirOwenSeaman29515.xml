    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the days of my season of salad ,</l>
     <l n="2">When the down was as dew on my cheek ,</l>
     <l n="3">And for French I was bred on the ballad ,</l>
     <l n="4">For Greek on the writers of Greek ,—</l>
     <l n="5">Then I sang of the rose that is ruddy ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of ‘ pleasure that winces and stings , ’</l>
     <l n="7">Of white women and wine that is bloody ,</l>
     <l n="8">And similar things .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Of Delight that is dear as Desi-er ,</l>
     <l n="10">And Desire that is dear as Delight ;</l>
     <l n="11">Of the fangs of the flame that is fi-er ,</l>
     <l n="12">Of the bruises of kisses that bite ;</l>
     <l n="13">Of embraces that clasp and that sever ,</l>
     <l n="14">Of blushes that flutter and flee</l>
     <l n="15">Round the limbs of Dolores , whoever</l>
     <l n="16">Dolores may be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">I sang of false faith that is fleeting</l>
     <l n="18">As froth of the swallowing seas ,</l>
     <l n="19">Time 's curse that is fatal as Keating</l>
     <l n="20">Is fatal to amorous fleas ;</l>
     <l n="21">Of the wanness of woe that is whelp of</l>
     <l n="22">The lust that is blind as a bat —</l>
     <l n="23">By the help of my Muse and the help of</l>
     <l n="24">The relative THAT .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Panatheist , bruiser and breaker</l>
     <l n="26">Of kings and the creatures of kings ,</l>
     <l n="27">I shouted on Freedom to shake her</l>
     <l n="28">Feet loose of the fetter that clings ;</l>
     <l n="29">Far rolling my ravenous red eye ,</l>
     <l n="30">And lifting a mutinous lid ,</l>
     <l n="31">To all monarchs and matrons I said I</l>
     <l n="32">Would shock them — and did .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Thee I sang , and thy loves , O Thalassian ,</l>
     <l n="34">O ‘ noble and nude and antique ! ’</l>
     <l n="35">Unashamed in the ‘ fearless old fashion ’</l>
     <l n="36">Ere washing was done by the week ;</l>
     <l n="37">When the ‘ roses and rapture ’ that girt you</l>
     <l n="38">Were visions of delicate vice ,</l>
     <l n="39">And the ‘ lilies and languors of virtue ’</l>
     <l n="40">Not nearly so nice .</l>

     <l n="43">Foam-yeast of a youth in its seething</l>
     <l n="44">On blasted and blithering sand !</l>
     <l n="45">Snake-crowned on your tresses and belted</l>
     <l n="46">With blossoms that coil and decay ,</l>
     <l n="47">Ye are gone ; ye are lost ; ye are melted</l>

     <l n="49">Hushed now is the bibulous bubble</l>

     <l n="51">Long stript and extinct is the stubble</l>
     <l n="52">Of hoary and harvested oats ;</l>
     <l n="53">From the sweets that are sour as the sorrel 's</l>
     <l n="54">The bees have abortively swarmed ;</l>
     <l n="55">And Algernon 's earlier morals</l>
     <l n="56">Are fairly reformed .</l>

     <l n="57">I have written a loyal Armada ,</l>
     <l n="58">And posed in a Jubilee pose ;</l>
     <l n="59">I have babbled of babies and played a</l>
     <l n="60">New tune on the turn of their toes ;</l>
     <l n="61">Washed white from the stain of Astarte ,</l>
     <l n="62">My books any virgin may buy ;</l>
     <l n="63">And I hear I am praised by a party</l>
     <l n="64">Called Something Mackay !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">When erased are the records , and rotten</l>
     <l n="66">The meshes of memory 's net ;</l>
     <l n="67">When the grace that forgives has forgotten</l>
     <l n="68">The things that are good to forget ;</l>
     <l n="69">When the trill of my juvenile trumpet</l>
     <l n="70">Is dead and its echoes are dead ;</l>
     <l n="71">Then the laurel shall lie on the crumpet</l>
     <l n="72">And crown of my head !</l>

    <head>MARSYAS IN HADES .</head>
    <head>( AFTER SIR L. M .)</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Next I saw</l>
     <l n="2">A pensive gentleman of middle age ,</l>
     <l n="3">That leaned against a Druid oak , his pipe</l>
     <l n="4">Pendent beneath his chin — a double one —</l>
     <l n="5">( Meaning the pipe ) ; reluctant was his breath ,</l>
     <l n="6">For he had mingled in the Morris dance</l>
     <l n="7">And rested blown ; but damsels in their teens ,</l>
     <l n="8">All decorous and decorously clad ,</l>
     <l n="9">Their very ankles hardly visible ,</l>
     <l n="10">Recalled his motions ; while , for chaperon ,</l>
     <l n="11">Good Mrs. Grundy up against the wall</l>
     <l n="12">Beamed approbation .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">On his face I read</l>
     <l n="14">Signs of high sadness such as poets wear ,</l>
     <l n="15">Being divinely discontented with</l>
     <l n="16">The praise of jeunes filles . Even as I looked ,</l>
     <l n="17">He touched the portion of his pipe reserved</l>
     <l n="18">For minor poetry of solemn tone ,</l>
     <l n="19">Checking the humorous stops intended for</l>
     <l n="20">Electioneering posters and the like ;</l>
     <l n="21">And therewithal he made the following</l>
     <l n="22">Addition to his Songs Unsung , or else</l>

     <l n="25">“ Excuse my saying ‘ Sir ’ like that ; it is</l>
     <l n="26">Our way in Hades here among the damned ;</l>
     <l n="27">For you must know that some of us are damned</l>
     <l n="28">Not only by faint praise but full applause</l>
     <l n="29">Of simple critics . Take my case . In me</l>
     <l n="30">Behold the good knight Marsyas , M. A .,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="40">You have read perhaps</l>

     <l n="67">The kilomètre ; yet I rhyme as well</l>
     <l n="68">A little ; but it takes a lot of time ,</l>

     <l n="31">whales ;</l>
     <l n="32">And out laughed Sal ( like a dog-toothed wheel was the laugh that Sal</l>
     <l n="33">laughed she ):</l>
     <l n="34">“ Now who 's for a bride on the shady side of up'ards of forty-three ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">

     <l n="36">And nautical names that no man frames but your amateur nautical</l>
     <l n="37">wit ;</l>
     <l n="38">And Sam said , “ Shiver my topping-lifts and scuttle my foc 's'le</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="42">Now the smack Tommy This and the smack Tommy That and the</l>
     <l n="43">Fuzzy-Wuz smack , all three ,</l>
     <l n="44">Their captains bold , they were Bill and Ned and Sam respectivelee .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And it 's writ in the rules that the primary schools of kippers should get off cheap For a two mile reach off Foulness beach when the July tide 's at neap ; And the lawless lubbers that lust for loot and filch the yearling stock They get smart raps from the coastguard chaps with their blunderbuss fixed half-cock .</p>
   <p>Now Bill the Skipper and Ned the Nipper could tell green cheese from blue , And Bill knew a trick and Ned knew a trick , but Sam knew a trick worth two .</p>
   <p>So Bill he sneaks a corporal 's breeks and a belt of pipeclayed hide , And splices them on to the jibsail-boom like a troopship on the tide .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And likewise Ned to his masthead he runs a rag of the Queen 's ,</l>
     <l n="2">With a rusty sword and a moke on board to bray like the Horse</l>
     <l n="3">Marines .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But Sam sniffs gore and he keeps off-shore and he waits for things to stir , Then he tracks for the deep with a long fog-horn rigged up like a bowchasér .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Now scarce had Ned dropped line and lead when he spots the</l>
     <l n="2">pipeclayed hide ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the corporal 's breeks on the jibsail-boom like a troopship on</l>
     <l n="4">the tide ;</l>
     <l n="5">And Bill likewise , when he ups and spies the slip of a rag of the</l>
     <l n="6">Queen 's ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the rusty sword , and he sniffs aboard the moke of the Horse</l>
     <l n="8">Marines .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So they each luffed sail , and they each turned tail , and they whipped their wheels like mad , When the one he said “ By the Lord , it 's Ned ! ” and the other , “ It 's Bill , by Gad ! ”</p>
   <p>Then about and about , and nozzle to snout , they rammed through breach and brace , And the splinters flew as they mostly do when a Government test takes place .</p>
   <p>Then up stole Sam with his little ram and the nautical talk flowed free , And in good bold type might have covered the two front sheets of the P. M. G .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But the fog-horn bluff was safe enough , where all was weed and</l>
     <l n="2">weft ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the conger-eels were a-making meals , and the pick of the tackle</l>
     <l n="4">left</l>
     <l n="5">Was a binnacle-lid and a leak in the bilge and the chip of a cracked</l>
     <l n="6">sheerstrake</l>
     <l n="7">And the corporal 's belt and the moke 's cool pelt and a portrait of</l>
     <l n="8">Francis Drake .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So Sam he hauls the dead men 's trawls and he booms for the harbour-bar , And the splitten fry are salted dry by the blink of the morning star .</p>

     <l n="1">And Sal o ’ the Dune was wed next moon by the man that paid his way</l>

    <p n="3">The Battle of the Bays .</p>
    <p n="4">Eighth Edition . Price 3s . 6d . net . Fcap . 8vo . Price $ 1. 25 .</p>
    <p n="5">SOME PRESS OPINIONS .</p>
    <p n="6">“ The new ‘ Rejected Addresses ’ of Mr. Owen Seaman are quite worthy to be ranked with the classic volumes of Horace and James .... The thing is done as well as it could be .... This little volume is merum sal . ” — The Spectator .</p>
    <p n="7">“ Mr. Kipling has never been so nimbly caught before , for Mr . Seaman has the art to reproduce his flute-notes as well as his big drum .... Several of the miscellaneous pieces are among the very best humourous poetry of this generation . We have laughed at nothing lately more than at ‘ Ars Postera , ’ at ‘ A New Blue Book , ’ at ‘ To a Boy-Poet of the Decadence , ’ and at ‘ To Julia in Shooting Togs . ’ But , after all , Mr . Seaman 's masterpiece up to date is certainly ‘ To the Lord of Potsdam . ’ ... This will live , or we are greatly mistaken , among the most effective examples of historical satire-lyric . ” — The Saturday Review .</p>
    <p n="8">“ It is certainly remarkable , in our dearth of great poetry , how good of its sort the satiric verse of our day is — so good , in fact , that nothing but the best will serve , and even the best , like Mr . Seaman 's , which in the day when Sir George Trevelyan was a wit would have taken people 's breath away , is apt to be treated as mere journalism .... But really it is the most characteristic expression of our time , using the accustomed forms of verse to point the neatest criticisms and the slyest of epigrams .... Mr . Seaman 's humourous imitation of Mr. Swinburne , Sir Edwin Arnold , Sir Lewis Morris , Mr. Kipling , and the rest , is in every case very funny . ” — St. James 's Gazette .</p>
    <p n="9">“ The book abounds in excellent fooling and really wholesome satire , the ingenuity and felicity of verse and expression giving it likewise a high artistic value .... Quips and cranks of audacious wit , strokes of a humour always sane and healthy , waylay the reader incessantly , and leave him no peace for laughter . ” — The Westminster Gazette .</p>
    <p n="10">“ Mr . Seaman must be tired of being compared to Calverley and J. K. S ., but he is of their company , and , what is more , on their level . ‘ The Battle of the Bays ’ ... bristles with points ; it is brilliant , ... and it has that easy conversational flow which is the one absolutely necessary characteristic of good humourous poetry .... One charm of writing such as Mr . Seaman 's is that it makes us feel quite obliged to poets whom we have never admired for being so good to parody . ” — Pall Mall Gazette .</p>
    <p n="11">“ Mr. Owen Seaman has a very neat talent for parody .... The ‘ Ballad of a Bun ’ is exceedingly funny , and ought to make even Mr. John Davidson laugh .... All the imitations are good . ” — The Times .</p>
    <p n="12">“ His versatility and bright and ready wit are conspicuous in all his work . As a parodist he is second to none , not even to Mr. Calverley , if we may take the word of the reviewers .... Mr . Seaman cracks the whip with consummate skill , and applies it with such naughty precision , that even his victims must find it difficult to withhold their admiration . ” — The National Observer .</p>

    <p>BY THE SAME AUTHOR . Horace at Cambridge New and Revised Edition . Price 3s . 6d . net . Fcap . 8vo . Price $ 1. 25 . “ To every university man ... this book will be a rare treat . But in virtue of its humour , its extreme and felicitous dexterity of workmanship both in rhyme and metre ... it will appeal to a far wider public . ” — Punch . “ We very cordially recommend Mr . Seaman 's book ... to all who are likely to care for verse which is not unworthy to be ranked with the efforts of Calverley the immortal . ” — The World . “ Mr . Seaman manages his ingenious metres with unfailing skill . ” — The Athenæum . “ A genial cynic with a genuine smack of Bon Gaultier . ” — St. James 's Gazette . “ The humour is bright and spontaneous . ” — The Times . “ Mr . Seaman 's book is never slipshod ; it has the neatness , the precision , the sparkle of its Latin namesake . ” — The Spectator . Tillers of the Sand SMITH , ELDER &amp; CO ., London . 3s . 6d . “ In the political sphere Mr . Seaman is at present without a rival . ” — The Globe . “ Taken as a whole , we are much mistaken if any better volume of political verse has made its appearance since the days of the Rolliad and the Anti-Jacobin . ” — The World . “ The best of the satirists on the other side is Mr. Owen Seaman , who has touched off some of the weaknesses of the late government with very happy and caustic humour . ” — The Spectator . “ Mr . Seaman is own brother to Calverley , and in modern times there has been nothing so good of its sort as ‘ Tillers of the Sand . ’ ... Mr . Seaman proves himself so brilliant a jester that it needs must be he takes the jester 's privilege of offending no one . ” — The Speaker . “ One of the most accomplished writers of occasional verse to-day . ” — Bookman . “ It is all so good that passages are hard to choose . ” — Scotsman . “ The author 's rare quality — a capacity for satirizing one 's political opponents with a wit that leaves no wound . ” — Mr. JAMES PAYN in The Illustrated London News . “ Brilliant and inimitable . ” — Chicago Daily News . In Cap and Bells Fifth Edition . Price 3s . 6d . net . Fcap . 8vo . Price $ 1. 25 . “ Here is no shouting , no banging of the bauble . The form of phrase , the inflexion of voice , the dancing light of humour , make up the motley which is the true jester 's ‘ only wear ’ ; and under his flashes of merriment is a sober , sound philosophy . This , after all , is the only kind of humour that lasts ... it is easy to appreciate , difficult to acquire ; and Mr. Owen Seaman , having acquired it with all the felicity of good humour and art , stands practically alone among the humourists of the hour .... His technical quality seems to strengthen with every new volume . ” — Mr. ARTHUR WAUGH in The St. James ’ Gazette . “ Clean laughter , and scholarly wit ; polished metre , and humorous phrase — these are to me the essential characteristics for which I am invariably glad to read Mr. Owen Seaman . ” — Mr. THEODORE COOK in Literature . “ The brilliant author of ‘ Cap and Bells ’ assumes , before the eyes of a later generation , the mantle of Crawley , and does the same sort of work more felicitously still . ” — The Speaker . “ At the end of the volume Mr . Seaman gives agreeable evidence that , in the domain of memorial and complimentary verse , he has the knack of combining felicity of phrase with a wholesome avoidance alike of adulation and excess . The ‘ In Memoriam ’ lines to Lewis Carroll , with the graceful reference to Sir John Tenniel , are particularly happy . ” — The Spectator . “ Calverley had not , or did not show in his verses , Mr . Seaman 's critical acuteness and depth .... As a critic in the form of parody , Mr . Seaman is without a rival .... Of his serious poems an ode to Queen Wilhelmina is a very graceful accomplishment of a difficult task . ” — Mr. G. S. STREET in The Pall Mall Magazine . “ Mr . Seaman is what we may call a critic of mannerisms , and a very keen critic to boot . His is a useful , not a merely destructive , function . He is no wanton debaser of the poetic currency . One might rather call him a touchstone of true merit in poetry . ” — Daily Chronicle . “ A new volume from the pen of Mr. Owen Seaman must needs be welcome . He is the most accomplished versifier among all our jesters . ” — The Globe . “ The parodies in Mr . Seaman 's new volume are wonderful examples of this difficult art ; the Stephen Phillips , the Alfred Austin , the Watts-Dunton , and the George Meredith are faultless . ” — Academy . “ Mr. Owen Seaman has already made his reputation as , perhaps , the surest modern poet to make you laugh , and the nature of his new collection of copies of verse cannot be better described than by saying that it is well worthy of his hand .... The book is heartsome and delightful all through . ” — The Scotsman . “ The present vogue of Mr. Owen Seaman 's delightful parodies is very great . ” — Liverpool Courier .
