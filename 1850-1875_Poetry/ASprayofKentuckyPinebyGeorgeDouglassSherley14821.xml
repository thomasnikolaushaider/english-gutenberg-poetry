    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>With James Whitcomb Riley , some years ago . This Man From Down On The Farm , made a Reading Tour , of — in Population — more than one-half of this Imperial Republic , including the Cream of the Canadian Provinces . Of that Tour , at some other time , in some more leisurely hour , he desires , if able , to make a full and faithful Record . This , is but a humble Spray of Kentucky Pine , placed at the feet of the Dead Poet !</p>
   <p>According to a long established Custom , the Man , in some way , in private print — — for the Relative , for the Friend , for the Stranger too — quietly Celebrates the various Red-Letter Days , of the Dear Lady Here , On the Banks of Wolf Run — his Mother ! Her full Restoration , to her usual Good Health , is a Source of much Joy , and the cause of much Gratitude . The many Prayers made for her Recovery must have been of much avail before the Great White Throne , of Infinite Mercy ! He is also deeply grateful , that the nearness of her Eighty-Fifth Birthday , makes it possible for him , to make an Inscription Two-fold , for the Dead , for the Living — for the Dear Poet , for the Beloved Mother ! The linking of their names together , under this Spray of Kentucky Pine — culled by a hand most loving — is like unto finding the other half of a broken Chord , in some Prelude Elusive : for James Whitcomb Riley , deeply endeared himself , to the Dear Lady Here , while he and her son were a long while away , on their Reading Tour . Out of sheer Kindliness , out of Goodness of Heart , he often wrote to her , delightful Letters of Good Cheer , filled with a charming detail , with more than a trifle of over-Praise ; all of which , is most acceptable , to the heart of a too fond mother . Recently , from his Winter Home in the South-land , he sent to her , in response to one of these Farm Bubbles , a little Bit of unpublished Verse , written before his hand had failed him , reproduced for her — and others — in fac-simile .</p>

     <l n="1">Pray deem it not , all too presumptuous , this humble</l>
     <l n="2">Spray of Kentucky Pine !</l>
     <l n="3">It serves as a Reverent Tribute to the One !</l>
     <l n="4">As a Loving Commemoration to the Other !</l>

     <l n="6">— Holding Two Telegrams And A Plea —</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I .</p>
   <p>When the word came that James Whitcomb Riley was Dead this Telegram was sent to a near Relative an astute Man of Affairs who with the Head of a Great Publishing House — a Prime Favorite from his early Boyhood of the Poet — held his well-placed Confidence in all matters concerning the necessary material Things of Life .</p>
   <p>The mightiest Monarch of the Indiana Forest lies prone upon his Native Soil ! This Man From Down On The Farm , Reverently , sends this humble Spray of Kentucky Pine , as a Symbol , ever-green , of his Lasting Love , for the Dead Poet : as a Symbol , made manifest , of his deep Sympathy , for You , for Yours .</p>
   <p>II .</p>
   <p>This Message was wired to a most Gentle Lady who had meant so much in so many ways to James Whitcomb Riley appealing as she did to the Best to the Highest in his Nature and who was indeed a “ Ministering Angel ” when “ Pain and Anguish ” wrung his brow , racked his frail body where lingered its Tenant his Immortal Soul !</p>
   <p>Tenderly , Lovingly , let the Fair Elaine cherish the Shield Invincible of her Sir Launcelot ! Some Day — Some Glad Day — she too , will go upward with the Flood , in the Dark Barge , decked with Flowers : clasping in her Beautiful Hand of Gentle Service , the Lily of Fidelity : floating with the Mystic Tide , to meet again — at Towered Camelot — — her Gallant , her Waiting Knight ! For Love shares with the Soul its Precious Immortality !</p>

     <l n="2">— To The Relatives To The Intimate Friends of James Whitcomb Riley —</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Let Lockerbie Street , in its Lovely Brevity , be held — if you will — as a Perpetual Reservation for the Children of your Great , your Growing City , holding the House , which for many years was the Happy Home of the Poet , as a Sacred Shrine . Let your fine Civic Building , now rising in its Majesty — like the Towers of Illion — made possible by his Generous Gift of the Site , made Glorious by the touch of his hand , on its Great Cornerstone : let it — if you will — proudly bear his Name . Let either one , or both , of these Noble Things be done , for the sake of his memory . Let this , that , or any other form of a Memorial wait upon the wisdom of your Choice : but no matter what is done ; how much is done ; or how it is done ; there is one Thing which ought not to be left undone . Every tender , slender needle , rising out of its Globular Greenness , in this humble Spray of Kentucky Pine , harbors this One Thought , this Single Plea ! This is the Plea :</p>
   <p>Let James Whitcomb Riley , skillfully cast in Bronze , simply clad in the plain blue garb of a Union Soldier Lad a Private — let him stand fur all Time , in your Circle , in the Centre , in the Heart of your City , the beloved City of his adoption . Let him stand there , under the shadow of that Mighty Shaft , the Tribute of your Grand Commonwealth , to her Valiant Sons — the Soldier , the Sailor . Let him stand there , on a one-piece Pedestal of Indiana Stone ; Simple , Massive . Thereon carve his Name , the date of his Birth ; the date of his Death ; and these Immortal words :</p>

   <p>O ! James Whitcomb Riley ! This Man From Down On The Farm — one-while your constant Companion , in work most Congenial , all-while your Faithful Friend — rejoices . and is exceeding Glad , That All Is Well With You ! For no one knew , better than you , the Wisdom , the Beauty , of Death ! No one the more fully realized the Folly , the Futility , of human Grief ! You firmly believed , that he , who follows The Christ ; that he , who , in all Humility , bears the Cross ; that he , who , in all Gratitude , wears upon his unworthy brow , the imprint of the Kiss Divine !— the Kiss of Forgiveness Complete — you firmly believed , that he ought to be brave enough , strong enough , to meet the Call , whensoever , wheresoever , it may chance to come . You firmly believed that the Call always comes at the Right Moment : that Incompletion Here , finds its Completement There : that every human Life holds — like the Palace of Aladdin — its unfinished Window : that the finite mind , hampered by its mortality , is a clog to any Completion , to any Earthly Perfection . Therefore , feeling , believing , as you did Here , now knowing , as you must know There , this Man rejoices , and is exceeding Glad , That All Is Well With You !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">O ! James Whitcomb Riley</l>
     <l n="2">Your Nature-on the surface — was</l>
     <l n="3">Simple , Honest , Open , Direct .</l>
     <l n="4">It was all of that but — it was More !</l>
     <l n="5">It was deeper than Tears !</l>
     <l n="6">It was wider than Laughter !</l>
     <l n="7">It was more profound , more subtle ,</l>
     <l n="8">than either your spoken Word .</l>
     <l n="9">or , your written , your printed Thought .</l>
     <l n="10">You were infinitely better than the</l>
     <l n="11">Very Best that you ever did !</l>
     <l n="12">High Praise , but True !</l>
     <l n="13">Your nature was strangely Complex :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There was the Man ! There was the Poet ! There was the Mystic !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Man could be known — and was — of all men .</l>
     <l n="2">The Poet could be read — as he was — and he understood .</l>
     <l n="3">He could Sing — as he did — Songs</l>
     <l n="4">which caught the Hearts of the</l>
     <l n="5">People — from the Cradle to the Grave !</l>

     <l n="7">O ! James Whitcomb Riley !</l>
     <l n="8">That Mystic Element in your Nature !</l>
     <l n="9">It was held under a Strong Curb :</l>
     <l n="10">It was constantly held in Check :</l>
     <l n="11">But it was never Overcome !</l>
     <l n="12">It was a Mood — not a Madness .</l>
     <l n="13">It seldom made an Outward Sign .</l>
     <l n="14">Then , it was brief , spasmodic , eratic .</l>
     <l n="15">It was known to but few , even of those</l>
     <l n="16">who came with you , in constant contact .</l>
     <l n="17">To this Man , that Mystic Element in your Nature ,</l>
     <l n="18">made a most wonderful Appeal , deep , strong .</l>
     <l n="19">To him , it was the real James Whitcomb Riley !</l>
     <l n="20">You were a Mystic , but never a Reformer .</l>
     <l n="21">You cheerfully rendered unto Ceasar all things</l>
     <l n="22">that were his just due .</l>
     <l n="23">You had no desire to overturn Natural Law ,</l>
     <l n="24">Human Regulation .</l>
     <l n="25">You accepted , without question , the Established</l>
     <l n="26">Order of Things .</l>
     <l n="27">But so strong was this touch of the Mystic</l>
     <l n="28">that , it you had desired , you could have ,</l>
     <l n="29">quickly , thickly , populated some far off Smiling Isle ,</l>
     <l n="30">of the Fair Summer Seas , with a Band of</l>
     <l n="31">Cultured Men , of Cultured Women , ready ,</l>
     <l n="32">eager , to follow you — that Mystic You ! into</l>
     <l n="33">the Creation of a New Cult , of a New Religion !</l>
     <l n="34">In your Poems there is but a trickle of the Mystic</l>
     <l n="35">— a flash a dash — as the falling of a Star !</l>
     <l n="36">That Edgar Allen Poe Episode , is the Answer .</l>
     <l n="37">You were unduly humiliated by that Incident —</l>
     <l n="38">— and it was but as Nothing</l>
     <l n="39">But your Super-Sensitiveness , made you Suffer !</l>

     <l n="40">O ! James Whitcomb Riley !</l>
     <l n="41">Death , hath yet other Compensations !</l>

     <l n="52">He knew your need ; he spoke no unnecessary word ;</l>

   <p>On the drive back to the little Station , you were the Man , the Poet , but not the Mystic ! You delighted the Wizard with your genial flow of Verse , of Story . When the watchful Wizard , smuggled you aboard your train — with privacy unbroken you , like King Saul , returned to your People , refreshed in body , restored in mind ; for had not the Wizard done for you , as David did for Saul , for had not he brought Peace to your no longer Troubled Soul ? Did he not say to you , in parting , “ All Is Well With You ? ”</p>

   <p>Postlude</p>
   <p>— Which ought to have been The Prelude to this Spray of Kentucky Pine . Because it was written , published , a little more than a year before the Death of the Poet . Therefore , it was a Tribute to him , Living !</p>
   <p>A Promethean Poet was there . He had touched the Heavenly flame ; he had lasted the Waters of Inspiration : he had drained the Crystal Cup of Fancy , finding therein neither Lees nor Dregs , which bite the tongue , stifle the song , of lesser Men ; he had reverently kissed the coy hand of Fame , when she had crowned his Worthy Brow , with her Wreath Immortal ! His Poems , homely , simple , sweet — springing from the lap of Nature — had spread , like wild-fire of the Forest , into the Four Quarters of the Globe . He came from the Land , across the River , where , in these latter days , the People quit the planting of the Potato , to pen a Poem : pause in the cultivation of the Corn , to compose a Novel . Some of it is good , very good ; Some of it is bad , very bad : but all of it produces a princely Revenue far in excess of any return from either the Potato or the Corn . Long before the avalanche-like advent of this State - wide Literary Madness , the Star of this Poet had risen — risen before , and still shines beyond , and above them all . The hand which wrote “ Goodbye , Jim ” — not classical in either Greek or Roman sense , yet a great American Classic — with its pungent odor of Blue Jeans , with its clean , sweet , clear-cut , fine smell , of its native soil — that hand may never again hold the Pen ; the man himself , may crumble — God forbid !— back into the Dust — that “ Little Dust of Harm ” — out of which he came ; but his Poems will not , cannot die . When those other Writers will have been forgotten ; when even the gifted Maker of “ Ben Hur ” will be , but as an empty name ; even then , this Poet , and his Poems , will cleave to the Mind , cling to the Heart , of countless Generations , not yet born !</p>
