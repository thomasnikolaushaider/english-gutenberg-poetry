     <head>A GOOD SPORT</head>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">I was a little lad , and the older boys called to me from the pier :</l>
       <l n="3">They called to me : ‘ Be a sport : be a sport ! Leap in and swim ! ’</l>
       <l n="4">I leaped in and swam , though I had never been taught a stroke .</l>
       <l n="5">Then I was made a hero , and they all shouted :</l>
       <l n="6">‘ Well done ! Well done ,</l>
       <l n="7">Brave boy , you are a sport , a good sport ! ’</l>
       <l n="8">And I was very glad .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">But now I wish I had learned to swim the right way ,</l>
       <l n="10">Or had never learned at all .</l>
       <l n="11">Now I regret that day ,</l>
       <l n="12">For it led to my fall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">I was a youth , and I heard the older men talking of the road to wealth ;</l>
       <l n="14">They talked of bulls and bears , of buying on margins ,</l>
       <l n="15">And they said , ‘ Be a sport , my boy , plunge in and win or lose it all !</l>
       <l n="16">It is the only way to fortune . ’</l>
       <l n="17">So I plunged in and won ; and the older men patted me on the back ,</l>
       <l n="18">And they said , ‘ You are a sport , my boy , a good sport ! ’</l>
       <l n="19">And I was very glad .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="20">But now I wish I had lost all I ventured on that day -</l>
       <l n="21">Yes , wish I had lost it all .</l>
       <l n="22">For it was the wrong way ,</l>
       <l n="23">And pushed me to my fall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="24">I was a young man , and the gay world called me to come ;</l>
       <l n="25">Gay women and gay men called to me , crying :</l>
       <l n="26">‘ Be a sport ; be a good sport !</l>
       <l n="27">Fill our glasses and let us fill yours .</l>
       <l n="28">We are young but once ; let us dance and sing ,</l>
       <l n="29">And drive the dull hours of night until they stand at bay</l>
       <l n="30">Against the shining bayonets of day . ’</l>
       <l n="31">So I filled my glass , and I filled their glasses , over and over again ,</l>
       <l n="32">And I sang and danced and drank , and drank and danced and sang ,</l>
       <l n="33">And I heard them cry , ‘ He is a sport , a good sport ! ’</l>
       <l n="34">As they held their glasses out to be filled again .</l>
       <l n="35">And I was very glad .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="36">Oh the madness of youth and song and dance and wine ,</l>
       <l n="37">Of woman 's eyes and lips , when the night dies in the arms of dawn !</l>
       <l n="38">And now I wish I had not gone that way .</l>
       <l n="39">Now I wish I had not heard them say ,</l>
       <l n="40">‘ He is a sport , a good sport ! ’</l>
       <l n="41">For I am old who should be young .</l>
       <l n="42">The splendid vigour of my youth I flung</l>
       <l n="43">Under the feet of a mad , unthinking throng .</l>
       <l n="44">My strength went out with wine and dance and song ;</l>
       <l n="45">Unto the winds of earth I tossed like chaff ,</l>
       <l n="46">With idle jest and laugh ,</l>
       <l n="47">The pride of splendid manhood , all its wealth</l>
       <l n="48">Of unused power and health -</l>
       <l n="49">Its dream of looking into some pure girl 's eyes</l>
       <l n="50">And finding there its earthly paradise -</l>
       <l n="51">Its hope of virile children free from blight -</l>
       <l n="52">Its thoughts of climbing to some noble height</l>
       <l n="53">Of great achievement — all these gifts divine</l>
       <l n="54">I cast away for song and dance and wine .</l>
       <l n="55">Oh , I have been a sport , a good sport ;</l>
       <l n="56">But I am very sad .</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">I left you for the large , loud world of men ,</l>
       <l n="5">When I had lived one little score of years .</l>
       <l n="6">I judged all women by you , and my heart</l>
       <l n="7">Was filled with high esteem and reverence</l>
       <l n="8">For your angelic sex ; and for the wives ,</l>
       <l n="9">The sisters , daughters , mothers of my friends</l>
       <l n="10">I held but holy thoughts . To fallen stars</l>
       <l n="11">( Of whom you told me in our last sweet talk ,</l>
       <l n="12">Warning me of the dangers in my path )</l>
       <l n="13">I gave wide pity as you bade me to ,</l>
       <l n="14">Saying their sins harked back to my base sex .</l>

       <l n="15">Now listen , mother mine : Ten years have passed</l>
       <l n="16">Since that clean-minded and pure-bodied youth ,</l>
       <l n="17">Thinking to write his name upon the stars ,</l>
       <l n="18">Went from your presence . He returns to you</l>
       <l n="19">Fallen from his altitude of thought ,</l>
       <l n="20">Hiding deep scars of sins upon his soul ,</l>
       <l n="21">His fair illusions shattered and destroyed .</l>
       <l n="22">And would you know the story of his fall ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="23">He sat beside a good man 's honoured wife</l>
       <l n="24">At her own table . She was beautiful</l>
       <l n="25">As woods in early autumn . Full of soft</l>
       <l n="26">And subtle witcheries of voice and look -</l>
       <l n="27">His senior , both in knowledge and in years .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="28">The boyish admiration of his glance</l>
       <l n="29">Was white as April sunlight when it falls</l>
       <l n="30">Upon a blooming tree , until she leaned</l>
       <l n="31">So close her rounded body sent quick thrills</l>
       <l n="32">Along his nerves . He thought it accident ,</l>
       <l n="33">And moved a little ; soon she leaned again .</l>
       <l n="34">The half-hid beauties of her heaving breast</l>
       <l n="35">Rising and falling under scented lace ,</l>
       <l n="36">The teasing tendrils of her fragrant hair ,</l>
       <l n="37">With intermittent touches on his cheek ,</l>
       <l n="38">Changed the boy 's interest to a man 's desire .</l>
       <l n="39">She saw that first young madness in his eyes</l>
       <l n="40">And smiled and fanned the flame . That was his fall ;</l>
       <l n="41">And as some mangled fly may crawl away</l>
       <l n="42">And leave his wings behind him in the web ,</l>
       <l n="43">So were his wings of faith in womanhood</l>
       <l n="44">Left in the meshes of her sensuous net .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="45">The youth , forced into sudden manhood , went</l>

       <l n="51">As children play with loaded guns . He heard</l>
       <l n="52">( Until the tale fell dull upon his ears )</l>
       <l n="53">The unsolicited complaints of wives</l>

       <l n="57">And openly or with appealing look</l>
       <l n="58">Asking for sympathy . ( The first blind step</l>
       <l n="59">That leads from wifely honour down to shame ,</l>
       <l n="60">Is ofttimes hid with flowers of sympathy . )</l>

       <l n="66">Charms meant alone for lover and for child .</l>

      <head>THE YOUNGER BORN</head>
      <head>The modern English-speaking young girl is the astonishment of the world and the despair of the older generation . Nothing like her has ever been seen or heard before . Alike in drawing-rooms and the amusement places of the people , she defies conventions in dress , speech , and conduct . She is bold , yet not immoral . She is immodest , yet she is chaste . She has no ideals , yet she is kind and generous . She is an anomaly and a paradox .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">We are the little daughters of Time and the World his wife ,</l>
       <l n="2">We are not like the children , born in their younger life ,</l>
       <l n="3">We are marred with our mother 's follies and torn with our father 's strife .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">We are the little daughters of the modern world ,</l>
       <l n="5">And Time , her spouse .</l>
       <l n="6">She has brought many children to our father 's house</l>
       <l n="7">Before we came , when both our parents were content</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">With simple pleasures and with quiet homely ways .</l>
       <l n="9">Modest and mild</l>
       <l n="10">Were the fair daughters born to them in those fair days ,</l>
       <l n="11">Modest and mild .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="12">But Father Time grew restless and longed for a swifter pace ,</l>
       <l n="13">And our mother pushed out beside him at the cost of her tender grace ,</l>
       <l n="14">And life was no more living but just a headlong race .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="15">And we are wild -</l>
       <l n="16">Yea , wild are we , the younger born of the World</l>
       <l n="17">Into life 's vortex hurled .</l>
       <l n="18">With the milk of our mother 's breast</l>
       <l n="19">We drank her own unrest ,</l>
       <l n="20">And we learned our speech from Time</l>
       <l n="21">Who scoffs at the things sublime .</l>
       <l n="22">Time and the World have hurried so</l>
       <l n="23">They could not help their younger born to grow ;</l>
       <l n="24">We only follow , follow where they go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="25">They left their high ideals behind them as they ran ;</l>
       <l n="26">There was but one goal , pleasure , for Woman or for Man ,</l>
       <l n="27">And they robbed the nights of slumber to lengthen the days ’ brief span .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="28">We are the demi-virgins of the modern day ;</l>
       <l n="29">All evil on the earth is known to us in thought ,</l>
       <l n="30">But yet we do it not .</l>
       <l n="31">We bare our beauteous bodies to the gaze of men ,</l>
       <l n="32">We lure them , tempt them , lead them on , and then</l>
       <l n="33">Lightly we turn away .</l>
       <l n="34">By strong compelling passion we are never stirred ;</l>
       <l n="35">To us it is a word -</l>
       <l n="36">A word much used when tragic tales are told ;</l>
       <l n="37">We are the younger born , yet we are very old</l>
       <l n="38">In understanding , and our knowledge makes us bold .</l>
       <l n="39">Boldly we look at life ,</l>
       <l n="40">Loving its stress and strife ,</l>
       <l n="41">And hating all conventions that may mean restraint ,</l>
       <l n="42">Yet shunning sin 's black taint .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="43">We know wine 's taste ;</l>
       <l n="44">And the young-maiden bloom and sweetness of our lips</l>
       <l n="45">Is often in eclipse</l>
       <l n="46">Under the brown weed 's stain .</l>
       <l n="47">Yet we are chaste ;</l>
       <l n="48">We have no large capacity for joy or pain ,</l>
       <l n="49">But an insatiable appetite for pleasure .</l>
       <l n="50">We have no use for leisure</l>
       <l n="51">And never learned the meaning of that word ‘ repose . ’</l>
       <l n="52">Life as it goes</l>
       <l n="53">Must spell excitement for us , be the cost what may .</l>
       <l n="54">Speeding along the way ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="55">We ofttimes pause to do some generous little deed ,</l>

       <l n="57">For we are kind at heart ,</l>
       <l n="58">Though with less heart than head ,</l>
       <l n="59">Unmoral , not immoral , when the worst is said ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There are so many little things that make life beautiful .</l>
       <l n="2">I can recall a day in early youth when I was longing for happiness .</l>
       <l n="3">Toward the western hills I gazed , watching for its approach .</l>
       <l n="4">The hills lay between me and the setting sun , and over them led a highway .</l>
       <l n="5">When some traveller crossed the hill , always a fine grey dust rose</l>
       <l n="6">cloudless against the sky .</l>
       <l n="7">The traveller I could not distinguish , but the dust-cloud I could see .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">And the dust-cloud seemed formed of hopes and possibilities — each speck an</l>
       <l n="9">embryo event .</l>
       <l n="10">At sunset , when the skies were fair , the dust-cloud grew radiant and shone</l>
       <l n="11">with visions .</l>
       <l n="12">The happiness for which I waited came not to me adown that western slope ,</l>
       <l n="13">But now I can recall the cloud of golden dust , the sunset , and the highway</l>
       <l n="14">leading over the hill ,</l>
       <l n="15">The wonderful hope and expectancy of my heart , the visions of youth in my</l>

       <l n="17">There are so many little things that make life beautiful .</l>
       <l n="18">I can recall another day when I rebelled at life 's monotony .</l>
       <l n="19">Everywhere about me was the commonplace ; and nothing seemed to happen .</l>
       <l n="20">Each day was like its yesterday , and to-morrow gave no promise of change .</l>
       <l n="21">My young heart rose rebellious in my breast ; and I ran aimlessly into the</l>
       <l n="22">sunlight — the glowing sunlight of June .</l>
       <l n="23">I sent out a dumb cry to Fate , demanding larger joys and more delight .</l>
       <l n="24">I ran blindly into a field of blooming clover .</l>
       <l n="25">It was breast-high , and billowed about me like rose-red waves of a fragrant</l>
       <l n="26">sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="27">The bees were singing above it ; and their little brown bodies were loaded</l>
       <l n="28">with honey-dew , extracted from the clover blossoms .</l>
       <l n="29">The sun reeled in the heavens dizzy with its own splendour .</l>
       <l n="30">The day went into night , without bringing any new event to change my life .</l>
       <l n="31">But now I recall the field of blooming clover , and the honey-laden bees ,</l>
       <l n="32">the glorious June sunlight , and the passion of youth in my heart ; and I</l>
       <l n="33">know that was happiness .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="34">There are so many little things that make life beautiful .</l>
       <l n="35">Yesterday a failure stared me in the face , where I had thought to welcome</l>
       <l n="36">proud success .</l>
       <l n="37">There was no radiant cloud of dust against the western sky , and no clover</l>
       <l n="38">field lying fragrant under mid-June suns ,</l>
       <l n="39">Neither was youth with me any more .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>But under the vines that clung against my walls , a flock of birds sought shelter just at twilight ; And , standing at my casement , I could hear the twitter of their voices and the soft , sweet flutter of their wings . Then over me there fell a sense of peace and calm , and love for all created things , and trust illimitable .</p>
     <p>And that I knew was happiness .</p>
     <p>There are so many little things to make life beautiful .</p>

       <l n="25">For never was one of us known by a male , or made to mother its kind ,</l>
       <l n="26">Unless there went from our minds consent ( or from what we call the mind ) .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ But you , the highest of all she-things , you gorge yourselves at your feasts , And you smoke and drink in a way we think would lower the standard of beasts ; For a ring , a roof and a rag , you are bought by your males , to have and to hold , And you mate and you breed without nature 's need , while your hearts and your bodies are cold .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ All unwanted your offspring come , or you slay them before they are born ;</l>
       <l n="2">And now the wild she-things of the earth have spoken and told their scorn .</l>
       <l n="3">We have no mind and we have no souls , maybe as you think — And still ,</l>
       <l n="4">Never one of us ate or drank the things that poison and kill ,</l>
       <l n="5">And never was one of us known by a male except by our wish and will . ’</l>

      <head>PROTEST</head>
       <l n="1">To sit in silence when we should protest</l>
       <l n="2">Makes cowards out of men . The human race</l>
       <l n="3">Has climbed on protest . Had no voice been raised</l>
       <l n="4">Against injustice , ignorance and lust</l>
       <l n="5">The Inquisition yet would serve the law</l>

       <l n="23">The precious one beneath her heart ; until</l>
       <l n="24">God 's soil is rescued from the clutch of greed</l>
       <l n="25">And given back to labour , let no man</l>

       <l n="1">When love is lost , the day sets towards the night ,</l>
       <l n="2">Albeit the morning sun may still be bright ,</l>
       <l n="3">And not one cloud-ship sails across the sky .</l>

       <l n="7">No scene spreads fair and beauteous to the sight ;</l>
       <l n="8">All , all seems dull and dreary to the eye</l>
       <l n="9">When love is lost .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">Love lends to life its grandeur and its might ;</l>
       <l n="11">Love goes , and leaves behind it gloom and blight ;</l>
       <l n="12">Like ghosts of time the pallid hours drag by ,</l>
       <l n="13">And grief 's one happy thought is that we die .</l>
       <l n="14">Ah , what can recompense us for its flight</l>
       <l n="15">When love is lost ?</l>

      <head>THE REVEALING ANGELS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Suddenly and without warning they came -</l>
       <l n="2">The Revealing Angels came .</l>
       <l n="3">Suddenly and simultaneously , through city streets ,</l>
       <l n="4">Through quiet lanes and country roads they walked .</l>
       <l n="5">They walked crying : ‘ God has sent us to find</l>
       <l n="6">The vilest sinners of earth .</l>
       <l n="7">We are to bring them before Him , before the Lord of Life . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">Their voices were like bugles ;</l>
       <l n="9">And then all war , all strife ,</l>
       <l n="10">And all the noises of the world grew still ;</l>
       <l n="11">And no one talked ;</l>
       <l n="12">And no one toiled , but many strove to flee away .</l>
       <l n="13">Robbers and thieves , and those sunk in drunkenness and crime ,</l>
       <l n="14">Men and women of evil repute ,</l>
       <l n="15">And mothers with fatherless children in their arms , all strove to hide .</l>
       <l n="16">But the Revealing Angels passed them by ,</l>
       <l n="17">Saying : ‘ Not you , not you .</l>
       <l n="18">Another day , when we shall come again</l>
       <l n="19">Unto the haunts of men ,</l>
       <l n="20">Then we will call your names ;</l>
       <l n="21">But God has asked us first to bring to him</l>
       <l n="22">Those guilty of greater shames</l>
       <l n="23">Than lust , or theft , or drunkenness , or vice -</l>
       <l n="24">Yea , greater than murder done in passion ,</l>
       <l n="25">Or self-destruction done in dark despair .</l>
       <l n="26">Now in His Holy Name we call :</l>
       <l n="27">Come one and all</l>
       <l n="28">Come forth ; reveal your faces . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Then through the awful silence of the world , Where noise had ceased , they came -  The sinful hosts . They came from lowly and from lofty places , Some poorly clad , but many clothed like queens ; They came from scenes of revel and from toil ; From haunts of sin , from palaces , from homes , From boudoirs , and from churches . They came like ghosts -  THE VAST BRIGADES OF WOMEN WHO HAD SLAIN THEIR HELPLESS , UNBORN CHILDREN . With them trailed Lovers and husbands who had said , ‘ Do this , ’ And those who helped for hire . They stood before the Angels — before the Revealing Angels they stood . And they heard the Angels say , And all the listening world heard the Angels say : ‘ These are the vilest sinners of all ; For the Lord of Life made sex that birth might come ; Made sex and its keen compelling desire To fashion bodies wherein souls might go From lower planes to higher , Until the end is reached ( which is Beginning ) . They have stolen the costly pleasures of the senses And refused to pay God 's price . They have come together , these men and these women , As male and female they have come together In the great creative act . They have invited souls , and then flung them out into space ; They have made a jest of God 's design . All other sins look white beside this sinning ; All other sins may be condoned , forgiven ; All other sinners may be cleansed and shriven ; Not these , not these . Pass on , and meet God 's eyes . ’</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The vast brigade moved forward , and behind then walked the Angels ,</l>
       <l n="2">Walked the sorrowful Revealing Angels .</l>

      <head>THE WELL-BORN</head>
       <l n="1">So many people — people — in the world ;</l>

       <l n="12">No tidal wave swept o'er them with its flood ;</l>
       <l n="13">No thrill of flesh or heart ; no leap of blood ;</l>
       <l n="14">No glowing fire , flaming to white desire</l>
       <l n="15">For mating and for motherhood :</l>

       <l n="21">Left on the sands to fertilise ,</l>
       <l n="22">She is the means through which the race goes on !</l>
       <l n="23">Not so the first intent .</l>
       <l n="24">Birth , as the Supreme Mind conceived it , meant</l>
       <l n="25">The clear imperious call of mate to mate</l>
       <l n="26">And the clear answer . Only thus and then</l>
       <l n="27">Are fine , well-ordered , and potential lives</l>
       <l n="28">Brought into being . Not by Church or State</l>
       <l n="29">Can birth be made legitimate ,</l>
       <l n="30">Unless</l>
       <l n="31">Love in its fulness bless .</l>
       <l n="32">Creation so ordains its lofty laws</l>
       <l n="33">That man , while greater in all other things ,</l>
       <l n="34">Is lesser in the generative cause .</l>
       <l n="35">The father may be merely man , the male ;</l>
       <l n="36">Yet more than female must the mother be .</l>
       <l n="37">The woman who would fashion</l>
       <l n="38">Souls , for the use of earth and angels meet ,</l>
       <l n="39">Must entertain a high and holy passion .</l>
       <l n="40">Not rank , or wealth , or influence of kings</l>
       <l n="41">Can give a soul its dower</l>
       <l n="42">Of majesty and power ,</l>
       <l n="43">Unless the mother brings</l>

       <l n="1">O well have we done the old tasks ! in the old , old ways of earth .</l>
       <l n="2">We have kept the house in order , we have given the children birth ;</l>
       <l n="3">And our sons went out with their fathers , and left us alone at the hearth !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>We have cooked the meats for their table ; we have woven their cloth at the loom ; We have pulled the weeds from their gardens , and kept the flowers in bloom ; And then we have sat and waited , alone in a silent room .</p>
     <p>We have borne all the pains of travail in giving life to the race ; We have toiled and saved , for the masters , and helped them to power and place ; And when we asked for a pittance , they gave it with grudging grace .</p>
     <p>On the bold , bright face of the dollar all the evils of earth are shown . We are weary of love that is barter , and of virtue that pines alone ; We are out in the world with the masters : we are finding and claiming our own !</p>
