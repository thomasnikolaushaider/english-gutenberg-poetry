     <l n="2">Night ; and the street a corpse beneath the moon ,</l>
     <l n="3">Upon the threshold of the jubilant day</l>
     <l n="4">That was to follow soon ;</l>
     <l n="5">Thickened with inundating dark</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Gainst which the drowning lamps kept struggle ; pole</l>
     <l n="7">And plank cast rigid shadows ; ‘ twas a stark</l>
     <l n="8">Thing waiting for its soul ,</l>
     <l n="9">The bones of the preluded pomp . I saw</l>
     <l n="10">In the cloud-sullied moon a pale array ,</l>
     <l n="11">A lengthened apparition , slowly draw ;</l>
     <l n="12">And as it came ,</l>
     <l n="13">Brake all the street in phantom flame</l>
     <l n="14">Of flag and flower and hanging , shadowy show</l>
     <l n="15">Of the to-morrow 's glories , as might suit</l>
     <l n="16">A pageant of the dead ; and spectral bruit</l>
     <l n="17">I heard , where stood the dead to watch the dead ,</l>
     <l n="18">The long Victorian line that passed with printless tread .</l>
     <l n="19">First went the holy poets , two on two ,</l>
     <l n="20">And music , sown along the hardened ground ,</l>
     <l n="21">Budded like frequence of glad daisies , where</l>
     <l n="22">Those sacred feet did fare ;</l>
     <l n="23">Arcadian pipe , and psaltery , around ,</l>
     <l n="24">And stringed viol , sound</l>
     <l n="25">To make for them melodious due .</l>
     <l n="26">In the first twain of those great ranks of death</l>
     <l n="27">Went one , the impress recent on his hair</l>
     <l n="28">Where it was dinted by the laureate wreath :</l>
     <l n="29">Who sang those goddesses with splendours bare</l>
     <l n="30">On Ida hill , before the Trojan boy ;</l>
     <l n="31">And many a lovely lay ,</l>
     <l n="32">Where Beauty did her beauties unarray</l>
     <l n="33">In conscious song . I saw young Love his plumes deploy ,</l>
     <l n="34">And shake their shivering lustres , till the night</l>
     <l n="35">Was sprinkled and bedropt with starry play</l>
     <l n="36">Of versicoloured light ,</l>
     <l n="37">To see that poet pass who sang him well ;</l>
     <l n="38">And I could hear his heart</l>
     <l n="39">Throb like the after-vibrance of a bell .</l>
     <l n="40">A Strength beside this Beauty , Browning went ,</l>
     <l n="41">With shrewd looks and intent ,</l>
     <l n="42">And meditating still some gnarled theme .</l>
     <l n="43">Then came , somewhat apart ,</l>
     <l n="44">In a fastidious dream ,</l>
     <l n="45">Arnold , with a half-discontented calm ,</l>
     <l n="46">Binding up wounds , but pouring in no balm .</l>
     <l n="47">The fervid breathing of Elizabeth</l>
     <l n="48">Broke on Christina 's gentle-taken breath .</l>
     <l n="49">Rossetti , whose heart stirred within his breast</l>
     <l n="50">Like lightning in a cloud , a spirit without rest ,</l>
     <l n="51">Came on disranked ; Song 's hand was in his hair ,</l>
     <l n="52">Lest Art should have withdrawn him from the band ,</l>
     <l n="53">Save for her strong command ;</l>
     <l n="54">And in his eyes high Sadness made its lair .</l>
     <l n="55">Last came a shadow tall , with drooping lid ,</l>
     <l n="56">Which yet not hid</l>
     <l n="57">The steel-like flashing of his armed glance ;</l>
     <l n="58">Alone he did advance ,</l>
     <l n="59">And all the throngs gave room</l>
     <l n="60">For one that looked with such a captain 's mien :</l>
     <l n="61">A scornful smile lay keen</l>
     <l n="62">On lips that , living , prophesied of doom .</l>
     <l n="63">His one hand held a lightning-bolt , the other</l>
     <l n="64">A cup of milk and honey blent with fire ;</l>
     <l n="65">It seemed as in that quire</l>
     <l n="66">He had not , nor desired not , any brother .</l>
     <l n="67">A space his alien eye surveyed the pride</l>
     <l n="68">Of meditated pomp , as one that much</l>
     <l n="69">Disdained the sight , methought ; then at a touch ,</l>
     <l n="70">He turned the heel , and sought with shadowy stride</l>
     <l n="71">His station in the dim ,</l>
     <l n="72">Where the sole-thoughted Dante waited him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="73">What throngs illustrious next , of Art and Prose ,</l>
     <l n="74">Too long to tell ; but other music rose</l>
     <l n="75">When came the sabre 's children : they who led</l>
     <l n="76">The iron-throated harmonies of war ,</l>
     <l n="77">The march resounding of the armed line ,</l>
     <l n="78">And measured movement of battalia :</l>
     <l n="79">Accompanied their tread</l>
     <l n="80">No harps , no pipes of soft Arcadia ,</l>
     <l n="81">But — borne to me afar —</l>
     <l n="82">The tramp of squadrons , and the bursting mine ,</l>
     <l n="83">The shock of steel , the volleying rifle-crack ,</l>
     <l n="84">And echoes out of ancient battles dead .</l>
     <l n="85">So Cawnpore unto Alma thundered back ,</l>
     <l n="86">And Delhi 's cannon roared to Gujerat :</l>
     <l n="87">Carnage through all those iron vents gave out</l>
     <l n="88">Her thousand-mouthed shout .</l>
     <l n="89">As balefire answering balefire is unfurled ,</l>
     <l n="90">From mountain-peaks , to tell the foe 's approaches ,</l>
     <l n="91">So ran that battle-clangour round the world ,</l>
     <l n="92">From famous field to field</l>
     <l n="93">So that reverberated war was tossed ;</l>
     <l n="94">And — in the distance lost —</l>
     <l n="95">Across the plains of France and hills of Spain</l>
     <l n="96">It swelled once more to birth ,</l>
     <l n="97">And broke on me again ,</l>
     <l n="98">The voice of England 's glories girdling in the earth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="99">It caught like fire the main ,</l>
     <l n="100">Where rending planks were heard , and broadsides pealed ,</l>
     <l n="101">That shook were all the seas ,</l>
     <l n="102">Which feared , and thought on Nelson . For with them</l>
     <l n="103">That struck the Russ , that brake the Mutineer ,</l>
     <l n="104">And smote the stiff Sikh to his knee ,— with these</l>
     <l n="105">Came they that kept our England 's sea-swept hem ,</l>
     <l n="106">And held afar from her the foreign fear .</l>
     <l n="107">After them came</l>
     <l n="108">They who pushed back the ocean of the Unknown ,</l>
     <l n="109">And fenced some strand of knowledge for our own</l>
     <l n="110">Against the outgoing sea</l>
     <l n="111">Of ebbing mystery ;</l>
     <l n="112">And on their banner “ Science ” blazoned shone .</l>
     <l n="113">The rear were they that wore the statesman 's fame ,</l>
     <l n="114">From Melbourne , to</l>
     <l n="115">The arcane face of the much-wrinkled Jew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="116">Lo , in this day we keep the yesterdays ,</l>
     <l n="117">And those great dead of the Victorian line .</l>
     <l n="118">They passed , they passed , but cannot pass away ,</l>
     <l n="119">For England feels them in her blood like wine .</l>
     <l n="120">She was their mother , and she is their daughter ,</l>
     <l n="121">This Lady of the water ,</l>
     <l n="122">And from their loins she draws the greatness which they were .</l>
     <l n="123">And still their wisdom sways ,</l>
     <l n="124">Their power lives in her .</l>
     <l n="125">Their thews it is , England , that lift thy sword ,</l>
     <l n="126">They are the splendour , England , in thy song ,</l>
     <l n="127">They sit unbidden at thy council-board ,</l>
     <l n="128">Their fame doth compass all thy coasts from wrong ,</l>
     <l n="129">And in thy sinews they are strong .</l>
     <l n="130">Their absence is a presence and a guest</l>
     <l n="131">In this day 's feast ;</l>
     <l n="132">This living feast is also of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="133">And this , O England , is thine All Souls ’ Day .</l>
     <l n="134">And when thy cities flake the night with flames ,</l>
     <l n="135">Thy proudest torches yet shall be their names .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="136">O royal England ! happy child</l>
     <l n="137">Of such a more than regal line ;</l>
     <l n="138">Be it said</l>
     <l n="139">Fair right of jubilee is thine ;</l>
     <l n="140">And surely thou art unbeguiled</l>
     <l n="141">If thou keep with mirth and play ,</l>
     <l n="142">With dance , and jollity , and praise ,</l>
     <l n="143">Such a To-day which sums such Yesterdays .</l>
     <l n="144">Pour to the joyless ones thy joy , thy oil</l>
     <l n="145">And wine to such as faint and toil .</l>
     <l n="146">And let thy vales make haste to be more green</l>
     <l n="147">Than any vales are seen</l>
     <l n="148">In less auspicious lands ,</l>
     <l n="149">And let thy trees clap all their leafy hands ,</l>
     <l n="150">And let thy flowers be gladder far of hue</l>
     <l n="151">Than flowers of other regions may ;</l>
     <l n="152">Let the rose , with her fragrance sweetened through ,</l>
     <l n="153">Flush as young maidens do ,</l>
     <l n="154">With their own inward blissfulness at play .</l>
     <l n="155">And let the sky twinkle an eagerer blue</l>
     <l n="156">Over our English isle</l>
     <l n="157">Than any otherwhere ;</l>
     <l n="158">Till strangers shall behold , and own that she is fair .</l>
     <l n="159">Play up , play up , ye birds of minstrel June ,</l>
     <l n="160">Play up your reel , play up your giddiest spring ,</l>
     <l n="161">And trouble every tree with lusty tune ,</l>
     <l n="162">Whereto our hearts shall dance</l>
     <l n="163">For overmuch pleasance ,</l>
     <l n="164">And children 's running make the earth to sing .</l>
     <l n="165">And ye soft winds , and ye white-fingered beams ,</l>
     <l n="166">Aid ye her to invest ,</l>
     <l n="167">Our queenly England , in all circumstance</l>
     <l n="168">Of fair and feat adorning to be drest ;</l>
     <l n="169">Kirtled in jocund green ,</l>
     <l n="170">Which does befit a Queen ,</l>
     <l n="171">And like our spirits cast forth lively gleams :</l>
     <l n="172">And let her robe be goodly garlanded</l>
     <l n="173">With store of florets white and florets red ,</l>
     <l n="174">With store of florets white and florets gold ,</l>
     <l n="175">A fair thing to behold ;</l>
     <l n="176">Intrailed with the white blossom and the blue ,</l>
     <l n="177">A seemly thing to view !</l>
     <l n="178">And thereunto ,</l>
     <l n="179">Set over all a woof of lawny air ,</l>
     <l n="180">From her head wavering to her sea-shod feet ,</l>
     <l n="181">Which shall her lovely beauty well complete ,</l>
     <l n="182">And grace her much to wear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="183">Lo , she is dressed , and lo , she cometh forth ,</l>
     <l n="184">Our stately Lady of the North ;</l>
     <l n="185">Lo , how she doth advance ,</l>
     <l n="186">In her most sovereign eye regard of puissance ,</l>
     <l n="187">And tiar 'd with conquest her prevailing brow ,</l>
     <l n="188">While nations to her bow .</l>
     <l n="189">Come hither , proud and ancient East ,</l>
     <l n="190">Gather ye to this Lady of the North ,</l>
     <l n="191">And sit down with her at her solemn feast ,</l>
     <l n="192">Upon this culminant day of all her days ;</l>
     <l n="193">For ye have heard the thunder of her goings-forth ,</l>
     <l n="194">And wonder of her large imperial ways .</l>
     <l n="195">Let India send her turbans , and Japan</l>
     <l n="196">Her pictured vests from that remotest isle</l>
     <l n="197">Seated in the antechambers of the Sun :</l>
     <l n="198">And let her Western sisters for a while</l>
     <l n="199">Remit long envy and disunion ,</l>
     <l n="200">And take in peace</l>
     <l n="201">Her hand behind the buckler of her seas ,</l>
     <l n="202">‘ Gainst which their wrath has splintered ; come , for she</l>
     <l n="203">Her hand ungauntlets in mild amity .</l>
     <l n="204">Victoria ! Queen , whose name is victory ,</l>
     <l n="205">Whose woman 's nature sorteth best with peace ,</l>
     <l n="206">Bid thou the cloud of war to cease</l>
     <l n="207">Which ever round thy wide-girt empery</l>
     <l n="208">Fumes , like to smoke about a burning brand ,</l>
     <l n="209">Telling the energies which keep within</l>
     <l n="210">The light unquenched , as England 's light shall be ;</l>
     <l n="211">And let this day hear only peaceful din .</l>
     <l n="212">For , queenly woman , thou art more than woman ;</l>
     <l n="213">Thy name the often-struck barbarian shuns ;</l>
     <l n="214">Thou art the fear of England to her foemen ,</l>
     <l n="215">The love of England to her sons .</l>
     <l n="216">And this thy glorious day is England 's ; who</l>
     <l n="217">Can separate the two ?</l>
     <l n="218">She joys thy joys and weeps thy tears ,</l>
     <l n="219">And she is one with all thy moods ;</l>
     <l n="220">Thy story is the tale of England 's years ,</l>
     <l n="221">And big with all her ills , and all her stately goods .</l>
     <l n="222">Now unto thee</l>
     <l n="223">The plenitude of the glories thou didst sow</l>
     <l n="224">Is garnered up in prosperous memory ;</l>
     <l n="225">And , for the perfect evening of thy day ,</l>
     <l n="226">An untumultuous bliss , serenely gay ,</l>
     <l n="227">Sweetened with silence of the after-glow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="228">Nor does the joyous shout</l>
     <l n="229">Which all our lips give out</l>
     <l n="230">Jar on that quietude ; more than may do</l>
     <l n="231">A radiant childish crew ,</l>
     <l n="232">With well-accordant discord fretting the soft hour ,</l>
     <l n="233">Whose hair is yellowed by the sinking blaze</l>
     <l n="234">Over a low-mouthed sea . Exult , yet be not twirled ,</l>
     <l n="235">England , by gusts of mere</l>
     <l n="236">Blind and insensate lightness ; neither fear</l>
     <l n="237">The vastness of thy shadow on the world .</l>
     <l n="238">If in the East</l>
     <l n="239">Still strains against its leash the unglutted beast</l>
     <l n="240">Of War ; if yet the cannon 's lip be warm ;</l>
     <l n="241">Thou , whom these portents warn but not alarm ,</l>
     <l n="242">Feastest , but with thy hand upon the sword ,</l>
     <l n="243">As fits a warrior race .</l>
     <l n="244">Not like the Saxon fools of olden days ,</l>
     <l n="245">With the mead dripping from the hairy mouth ,</l>
     <l n="246">While all the South</l>
     <l n="247">Filled with the shaven faces of the Norman horde .</l>
