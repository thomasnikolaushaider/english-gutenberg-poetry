    <p n="1">Most of the lyrics of love and life , the translations of which from Bengali are published in this book , were written much earlier than the series of religious poems contained in the book named Gitanjali . The translations are not always literal — the originals being sometimes abridged and sometimes paraphrased .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SERVANT . When you have finished with others , that is my time .</l>

   <p>SERVANT . I will give up my other work . I will throw my swords and lances down in the dust . Do not send me to distant courts ; do not bid me undertake new conquests . But make me the gardener of your flower garden .</p>
   <p>QUEEN . What will your duties be ?</p>
   <p>SERVANT . The service of your idle days . I will keep fresh the grassy path where you walk in the morning , where your feet will be greeted with praise at every step by the flowers eager for death . I will swing you in a swing among the branches of the saptaparna , where the early evening moon will struggle to kiss your skirt through the leaves . I will replenish with scented oil the lamp that burns by your bedside , and decorate your footstool with sandal and saffron paste in wondrous designs .</p>
   <p>QUEEN . What will you have for your reward ?</p>
   <p>SERVANT . To be allowed to hold your little fists like tender lotus-buds and slip flower chains over your wrists ; to tinge the soles of your feet with the red juice of ashoka petals and kiss away the speck of dust that may chance to linger there .</p>
   <p>QUEEN . Your prayers are granted , my servant , you will be the gardener of my flower garden .</p>

     <l n="1">“ Ah , poet , the evening draws near ; your hair is turning grey .</l>
     <l n="2">“ Do you in your lonely musing hear the message of the hereafter ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ It is evening , ” the poet said , “ and I am listening because some one may call from the village , late though it be . “ I watch if young straying hearts meet together , and two pairs of eager eyes beg for music to break their silence and speak for them . “ Who is there to weave their passionate songs , if I sit on the shore of life and contemplate death and the beyond ?</p>
   <p>“ The early evening star disappears . “ The glow of a funeral pyre slowly dies by the silent river . “ Jackals cry in chorus from the courtyard of the deserted house in the light of the worn-out moon . “ If some wanderer , leaving home , come here to watch the night and with bowed head listen to the murmur of the darkness , who is there to whisper the secrets of life into his ears if I , shutting my doors , should try to free myself from mortal bonds ?</p>

   <p>In the morning I cast my net into the sea . I dragged up from the dark abyss things of strange aspect and strange beauty — some shone like a smile , some glistened like tears , and some were flushed like the cheeks of a bride . When with the day 's burden I went home , my love was sitting in the garden idly tearing the leaves of a flower . I hesitated for a moment , and then placed at her feet all that I had dragged up , and stood silent . She glanced at them and said , “ What strange things are these ? I know not of what use they are ! ” I bowed my head in shame and thought , “ I have not fought for these , I did not buy them in the market ; they are not fit gifts for her . ” Then the whole night through I flung them one by one into the street . In the morning travellers came ; they picked them up and carried them into far countries .</p>

   <p>O mother , the young Prince is to pass by our door ,— how can I attend to my work this morning ? Show me how to braid up my hair ; tell me what garment to put on . Why do you look at me amazed , mother ? I know well he will not glance up once at my window ; I know he will pass out of my sight in the twinkling of an eye ; only the vanishing strain of the flute will come sobbing to me from afar . But the young Prince will pass by our door , and I will put on my best for the moment .</p>
   <p>O mother , the young Prince did pass by our door , and the morning sun flashed from his chariot . I swept aside the veil from my face , I tore the ruby chain from my neck and flung it in his path . Why do you look at me amazed , mother ? I know well he did not pick up my chain ; I know it was crushed under his wheels leaving a red stain upon the dust , and no one knows what my gift was nor to whom . But the young Prince did pass by our door , and I flung the jewel from my breast before his path .</p>

   <p>When I go alone at night to my love-tryst , birds do not sing , the wind does not stir , the houses on both sides of the street stand silent . It is my own anklets that grow loud at every step and I am ashamed .</p>
   <p>When I sit on my balcony and listen for his footsteps , leaves do not rustle on the trees , and the water is still in the river like the sword on the knees of a sentry fallen asleep . It is my own heart that beats wildly — I do not know how to quiet it .</p>
   <p>When my love comes and sits by my side , when my body trembles and my eyelids droop , the night darkens , the wind blows out the lamp , and the clouds draw veils over the stars . It is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light . I do not know how to hide it .</p>

   <p>I hoped my love would be saved from the shivering shame of the shelterless , but you turn your face away . Yes , your path lies open before you , but you have cut off my return , and left me stripped naked before the world with its lidless eyes staring night and day .</p>

   <p>A wandering madman was seeking the touchstone , with matted locks tawny and dust-laden , and body worn to a shadow , his lips tight-pressed , like the shut-up doors of his heart , his burning eyes like the lamp of a glow-worm seeking its mate .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Before him the endless ocean roared .</l>
     <l n="2">The garrulous waves ceaselessly talked of hidden treasures ,</l>
     <l n="3">mocking the ignorance that knew not their meaning .</l>
     <l n="4">Maybe he now had no hope remaining , yet he would not rest , for</l>
     <l n="5">the search had become his life ,—</l>

     <l n="9">never be reached —</l>
     <l n="10">Even so on the lonely shore the madman with dusty tawny locks</l>
     <l n="11">still roamed in search of the touchstone .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>One day a village boy came up and asked , “ Tell me , where did you come at this golden chain about your waist ? ” The madman started — the chain that once was iron was verily gold ; it was not a dream , but he did not know when it had changed . He struck his forehead wildly — where , O where had he without knowing it achieved success ? It had grown into a habit , to pick up pebbles and touch the chain , and to throw them away without looking to see if a change had come ; thus the madman found and lost the touchstone . The sun was sinking low in the west , the sky was of gold . The madman returned on his footsteps to seek anew the lost treasure , with his strength gone , his body bent , and his heart in the dust , like a tree uprooted .</p>

Brighter than all the gladness of the crowd was the bright smile of a girl who bought for a farthing a whistle of palm leaf . The shrill joy of that whistle floated above all laughter and noise . An endless throng of people came and jostled together . The road was muddy , the river in flood , the field under water in ceaseless rain . Greater than all the troubles of the crowd was a little boy 's trouble — he had not a farthing to buy a painted stick . His wistful eyes gazing at the shop made this whole meeting of men so pitiful .</p>

Her little brother , with shaven head and brown , naked , mud - covered limbs , follows after her and waits patiently on the high bank at her bidding . She goes back home with the full pitcher poised on her head , the shining brass pot in her left hand , holding the child with her right — she the tiny servant of her mother , grave with the weight of the household cares .</p>

     <l n="1">One day I saw this naked boy sitting with legs outstretched .</l>
     <l n="2">In the water his sister sat rubbing a drinking-pot with a handful</l>
     <l n="3">of earth , turning it round and round .</l>
     <l n="4">Near by a soft-haired lamb stood gazing along the bank .</l>
     <l n="5">It came close to where the boy sat and suddenly bleated aloud ,</l>
     <l n="6">and the child started up and screamed .</l>
     <l n="7">His sister left off cleaning her pot and ran up .</l>
     <l n="8">She took up her brother in one arm and the lamb in the other , and</l>
     <l n="9">dividing her caresses between them bound in one bond of</l>
     <l n="10">affection the offspring of beast and man .</l>

     <l n="12">It was in May . The sultry noon seemed endlessly long . The dry</l>
     <l n="13">earth gaped with thirst in the heat .</l>
     <l n="14">When I heard from the riverside a voice calling , “ Come , my</l>
     <l n="15">darling ! ”</l>
     <l n="16">I shut my book and opened the window to look out .</l>
     <l n="17">I saw a big buffalo with mud-stained hide , standing near the</l>
     <l n="18">river with placid , patient eyes ; and a youth , knee deep in</l>
     <l n="19">water , calling it to its bath .</l>
     <l n="20">I smiled amused and felt a touch of sweetness in my heart .</l>

   <p>I often wonder where lie hidden the boundaries of recognition between man and the beast whose heart knows no spoken language . Through what primal paradise in a remote morning of creation ran the simple path by which their hearts visited each other . Those marks of their constant tread have not been effaced though their kinship has been long forgotten . Yet suddenly in some wordless music the dim memory wakes up and the beast gazes into the man 's face with a tender trust , and the man looks down into its eyes with amused affection . It seems that the two friends meet masked and vaguely know each other through the disguise .</p>

   <p>Why do you whisper so faintly in my ears , O Death , my Death ? When the flowers droop in the evening and cattle come back to their stalls , you stealthily come to my side and speak words that I do not understand . Is this how you must woo and win me with the opiate of drowsy murmur and cold kisses , O Death , my Death ?</p>
   <p>Will there be no proud ceremony for our wedding ? Will you not tie up with a wreath your tawny coiled locks ? Is there none to carry your banner before you , and will not the night be on fire with your red torch-lights , O Death , my Death ?</p>

   <p>She dwelt on the hillside by the edge of a maize-field , near the spring that flows in laughing rills through the solemn shadows of ancient trees . The women came there to fill their jars , and travellers would sit there to rest and talk . She worked and dreamed daily to the tune of the bubbling stream .</p>
   <p>One evening the stranger came down from the cloud-hidden peak ; his locks were tangled like drowsy snakes . We asked in wonder , “ Who are you ? ” He answered not but sat by the garrulous stream and silently gazed at the hut where she dwelt . Our hearts quaked in fear and we came back home when it was night .</p>
   <p>Next morning when the women came to fetch water at the spring by the deodar trees , they found the doors open in her hut , but her voice was gone and where was her smiling face ? The empty jar lay on the floor and her lamp had burnt itself out in the corner . No one knew where she had fled to before it was morning — and the stranger had gone .</p>
   <p>In the month of May the sun grew strong and the snow melted , and we sat by the spring and wept . We wondered in our mind , “ Is there a spring in the land where she has gone and where she can fill her vessel in these hot thirsty days ? ” And we asked each other in dismay , “ Is there a land beyond these hills where we live ? ”</p>
   <p>It was a summer night ; the breeze blew from the south ; and I sat in her deserted room where the lamp stood still unlit . When suddenly from before my eyes the hills vanished like curtains drawn aside . “ Ah , it is she who comes . How are you , my child ? Are you happy ? But where can you shelter under this open sky ? And , alas , our spring is not here to allay your thirst . ”</p>
   <p>“ Here is the same sky , ” she said , “ only free from the fencing hills ,— this is the same stream grown into a river ,— the same earth widened into a plain . ” “ Everything is here , ” I sighed , “ only we are not . ” She smiled sadly and said , “ You are in my heart . ” I woke up and heard the babbling of the stream and the rustling of the deodars at night .</p>
