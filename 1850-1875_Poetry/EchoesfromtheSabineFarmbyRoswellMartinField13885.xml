    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">One Sunday evening in the winter of 1890 Eugene Field and the writer were walking in Lake View , Chicago , on their way to visit the library of a common friend , when the subject of publishing a book for Field came up for discussion .</p>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Little Book of Western Verse and The Little Book of Profitable Tales had been privately printed the year before at Chicago , and Field had been frequently reminded that the writer was ready and willing to stand sponsor for any new volume he , Field , might desire to bring out .</p>
   <p>“ The only thing I have on hand that might make a book , ” said Field , “ are some few paraphrases of the Odes of Horace which my brother , ‘ Rose , ’ and I have been fooling over , and which , truth to tell , are certainly freely rendered . There are not enough of them , but we 'll do some more , and I 'll add a brief Life of Horace as a preface or introduction . ”</p>
   <p>It is to be regretted that Field never carried out his intention with respect to this last , for he had given much thought and study to the great Roman satirist , and what Eugene Field could have said upon the subject must have been of interest . It is my belief that as he thought upon the matter it grew too great for him to handle within the space he had at first determined , and that tucked away within the recesses of his literary intentions was the determination , nullified by his early death , to write , con amore , a life of Quintus Horatius Flaccus .</p>
   <p>This determination to write separately an extended account of Horace greatly reduced the bulk of the material intended for the Sabine Echoes , and it was with respect to this that Field apologetically and , as was his wont , humorously wrote :</p>
   <p>“ The volume may be rather thin in corpore , but think how hefty it will be intellectually . ”</p>
   <p>When it came to the discussion of how many copies should be printed it was suggested that the edition be an exceedingly limited one , in order to cause as much scrambling and heartburning as possible among our bibliophilic brethren . And never shall I forget the seriousness of the man 's face , nor the roars of laughter that followed , when he suggested that fifty copies only should be made , and that we should reserve one each and burn the other forty-eight !</p>
   <p>It was a biting cold night and we had been loitering by the way , stopping to debate each point as it arose — but now we plunged on with excess of motion to keep ourselves warm , breaking out with occasional peals of laughter as we thought of our plan to make the publication what the booksellers call “ excessively rare . ”</p>
   <p>Field , elsewhere , has said he did not know why the original intention as to the destruction of the forty-eight copies was not carried out , but the answer is not far away . As the time for publication approached it was found impossible that such and such a friend should be forgotten in the matter of a copy , and so it went on until it was deemed prudent to add fifty to the number originally intended to be issued , and that decision , in the light of what followed , proved to be an eminently wise one . More than once some to me unknown friend of Field would write a pleasant lie as a reason to gain possession of the book , and up in a corner of the letter would be found an endorsement of the request after this fashion :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">What 's writ below</l>
     <l n="2">I 'd have you know</l>
     <l n="3">Nor falsehood nor romance is ;</l>
     <l n="4">It 's solemn truth ,</l>
     <l n="5">So grant the youth</l>
     <l n="6">The boon he seeks , dear Francis .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>EUGENE FIELD .</p>
   <p>It is perhaps unnecessary to add that , however flimsy the pretext upon which the request for a copy was made , it never failed of its object if it brought with it Field 's endorsement . Among many pleasant utterances on this subject Field has said that but for the writer the Horatian verses would not have been given to the world — and this has been taken to mean more than was intended , and much unearned praise has been bestowed . But , in allusion to the original issue of the Odes , Field added , “ in this charming guise , ” which places quite another construction upon the matter .</p>
   <p>It may be that the enthusiasm displayed not only pleased Field , and incited him and his brother Roswell to perform that which , otherwise , might have been indefinitely deferred , but there is no question but that they intended to publish the Horatian odes at some time or another . Field was greatly delighted with the reception of this work , and I once heard him say it would outlive all his other books . He came naturally by his love of the classics . His father was a splendid scholar who obliged his sons to correspond with him in Latin . Field 's favorite ode was the Bandusian Spring , the paraphrasing of which in the styles of the various writers of different periods gave him genuine joy and is perhaps the choice bit of the collection . The Echoes from the Sabine Farm was the most ambitious work Field had attempted up to the time of its issue . He was not at all sure that the public for whom he wrote , what following he then felt was his own , would accept his efforts in this direction with any sort of acclaim . Unquestionably , Field , at all times , believed in himself and in his power ultimately to make a name , as every man must who achieves success , but he was as far from believing that the public would accept him as an interpreter of Horatian odes as was Edward Fitzgerald with respect to Omar Khayyám . In short , he looked upon his work in the original publication of Echoes from the Sabine Farm as a labor of love — an effort from which some reputation might come , but certainly no monetary remuneration . It was because he so regarded it that he permitted the work to be first issued under the bolstering influence of a patron . It was , so he thought , an excellent opportunity to show his friends and acquaintances that his Pegasus was capable of soaring to classic heights , and he little dreamed that the paraphrasing of the Odes of Horace over which “ Rose and I have been fooling ” would be required for a popular edition . With the announcement of the Scribner edition of The Sabine Echoes came also the intelligence of Field 's death .</p>
   <p>I have found people who were somewhat puzzled as to the exact intentions of the Fields with respect to these translations and paraphrases . However , there can be no chance for mistake even to the veriest embryonic reader of Horace , if he will but remember that , while some of these transcriptions are indeed very faithful reproductions or adaptations of the original , others again are to be accepted as the very riot of burlesque verse-making .</p>
   <p>The last stanza in the epilogue of this book reads :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Or if we part to meet no more</l>
     <l n="2">This side the misty Stygian river ,</l>
     <l n="3">Be sure of this : On yonder shore</l>
     <l n="4">Sweet cheer awaiteth such as we —</l>
     <l n="5">A Sabine pagan 's heaven , O friend —</l>
     <l n="6">And fellowship that knows no end .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Come , dear old friend , and with us twain</l>
     <l n="2">To calm Digentian groves repair ;</l>
     <l n="3">The turtle coos his sweet refrain</l>
     <l n="4">And posies are a-blooming there ;</l>
     <l n="5">And there the romping Sabine girls</l>
     <l n="6">Bind myrtle in their lustrous curls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">I know a certain ilex-tree</l>
     <l n="8">Whence leaps a fountain cool and clear .</l>
     <l n="9">Its voices summon you and me ;</l>
     <l n="10">Come , let us haste to share its cheer !</l>
     <l n="11">Methinks the rapturous song it sings</l>
     <l n="12">Should woo our thoughts from mortal things .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">But , good old friend , I charge thee well ,</l>
     <l n="14">Watch thou my brother all the while ,</l>
     <l n="15">Lest some fair Lydia cast her spell</l>
     <l n="16">Round him unschooled in female guile .</l>
     <l n="17">Those damsels have no charms for me ;</l>
     <l n="18">Guard thou that brother ,— I 'll guard thee !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">And , lo , sweet friend ! behold this cup ,</l>
     <l n="20">Round which the garlands intertwine ;</l>
     <l n="21">With Massic it is foaming up ,</l>
     <l n="22">And we would drink to thee and thine .</l>
     <l n="23">And of the draught thou shalt partake ,</l>
     <l n="24">Who lov'st us for our father 's sake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Hark you ! from yonder Sabine farm</l>
     <l n="26">Echo the songs of long ago ,</l>
     <l n="27">With power to soothe and grace to charm</l>
     <l n="28">What ills humanity may know ;</l>
     <l n="29">With that sweet music in the air ,</l>
     <l n="30">‘ T is Love and Summer everywhere .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">So , though no grief consumes our lot</l>
     <l n="32">( Since all our lives have been discreet ) ,</l>
     <l n="33">Come , in this consecrated spot ,</l>
     <l n="34">Let 's see if pagan cheer be sweet .</l>
     <l n="35">Now , then , the songs ; but , first , more wine .</l>
     <l n="36">The gods be with you , friends of mine !</l>

     <l n="1">Dear , noble friend ! a virgin cask</l>
     <l n="2">Of wine solicits your attention ;</l>
     <l n="3">And roses fair , to deck your hair ,</l>
     <l n="4">And things too numerous to mention .</l>
     <l n="5">So tear yourself awhile away</l>
     <l n="6">From urban turmoil , pride , and splendor ,</l>
     <l n="7">And deign to share what humble fare</l>
     <l n="8">And sumptuous fellowship I tender .</l>
     <l n="9">The sweet content retirement brings</l>

     <l n="14">Vainly of ice-cream soda-water .</l>
     <l n="15">And meanwhile you , defying heat ,</l>
     <l n="16">With patriotic ardor ponder</l>
     <l n="17">On what old Rome essays at home ,</l>
     <l n="18">And what her heathen do out yonder .</l>
     <l n="19">Mæcenas , no such vain alarm</l>
     <l n="20">Disturbs the quiet of this farm !</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="21">God in His providence obscures</l>

     <l n="35">When favoring gales bring in my ships ,</l>
     <l n="36">I hie to Rome and live in clover ;</l>

     <l n="38">And anchor till the storm blows over .</l>

     <l n="11">The way he intercepted boars was quite beyond surmising ,—</l>

     <l n="13">So I repeat that with these maids fate is unkindly dealing ,</l>

    <head>AT THE BALL GAME</head>

     <l n="1">What gods or heroes , whose brave deeds none can dispute ,</l>
     <l n="2">Will you record , O Clio , on the harp and flute ?</l>
     <l n="3">What lofty names shall sportive Echo grant a place</l>
     <l n="4">On Pindus ’ crown or Helicon 's cool , shadowy space ?</l>

     <l n="5">Sing not , my Orpheus , sweeping oft the tuneful strings ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of gliding streams and nimble winds and such poor things ;</l>
     <l n="7">But lend your measures to a theme of noble thought ,</l>
     <l n="8">And crown with laurel these great heroes , as you ought .</l>

     <l n="9">Now steps Ryanus forth at call of furious Mars ,</l>
     <l n="10">And from his oaken staff the sphere speeds to the stars ;</l>
     <l n="11">And now he gains the tertiary goal , and turns ,</l>
     <l n="12">While whiskered balls play round the timid staff of Burns .</l>

     <l n="13">Lo ! from the tribunes on the bleachers comes a shout ,</l>
     <l n="14">Beseeching bold Ansonius to line ‘ em out ;</l>
     <l n="15">And as Apollo 's flying chariot cleaves the sky ,</l>
     <l n="16">So stanch Ansonius lifts the frightened ball on high .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Like roar of ocean beating on the Cretan cliff ,</l>
     <l n="18">The strong Komiske gives the panting sphere a biff ;</l>

     <l n="20">When twice and thrice Mikellius beats the mocking air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">And as Achilles ’ fleet the Trojan waters sweeps ,</l>
     <l n="22">So horror sways the throng ,— Pfefferius sleeps !</l>

     <l n="24">The Equus Carolus defies , and is retired .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">So waxes fierce the strife between these godlike men ;</l>
     <l n="26">And as the hero 's fame grows by Virgilian pen ,</l>
     <l n="27">So let Clarksonius Maximus be raised to heights</l>
     <l n="28">As far above the moon as moon o'er lesser lights .</l>

     <l n="29">But as for me , the ivy leaf is my reward ,</l>

     <l n="31">With crest exalted , and O “ People , ” with delight ,</l>
     <l n="32">I 'll proudly strike the stars , and so be out of sight .</l>
