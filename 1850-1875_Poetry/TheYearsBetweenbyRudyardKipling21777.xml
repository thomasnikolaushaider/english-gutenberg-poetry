    <p>TO THE SEVEN WATCHMEN Seven Watchmen sitting in a tower , Watching what had come upon mankind , Showed the Man the Glory and the Power , And bade him shape the Kingdom to his mind . ‘ All things on Earth your will shall win you ’ ( ‘ Twas so their counsel ran ) ‘ But the Kingdom — the Kingdom is within you , ’ Said the Man 's own mind to the Man . For time , and some time — As it was in the bitter years before , So it shall be in the over-sweetened hour — That a man 's mind is wont to tell him more Than Seven Watchmen sitting in a tower .</p>

What avails the classic bent , 96 A tinker out of Bedford , 38 Be well assured that on our side , 24 Brethren , how shall it fare with me , 33 Broke to every known mischance , lifted over all , 15 For all we have and are , 21 God rest you , peaceful gentlemen , let nothing you dismay , 44 ‘ Have you news of my boy Jack ? ’ 61 He passed in the very battle-smoke , 31 I ate my fill of a whale that died , 121 I do not look for holy saints to guide me on my way , 114 If you stop to find out what your wages will be , 80 In a land that the sand overlays — the ways to her gates are untrod , 148 Not in the thick of the fight , 63 Oh ye who hold the written clue , 93 Once , after long-drawn revel at The Mermaid , 91 Seven Watchmen sitting in a tower , v The Babe was laid in the Manger , 52 The banked oars fell an hundred strong , 1 The dark eleventh hour , 9 The Doorkeepers of Zion , 29 The fans and the beltings they roar round me , 81 The first time that Peter denied his Lord , 125 The Garden called Gethsemane , 85 The overfaithful sword returns the user , 87 There are no leaders to lead us to honour , and yet without leaders we sally , 70 The road to En-dor is easy to tread , 55 These were never your true love 's eyes , 119 The Sons of Mary seldom bother , for they have inherited that good part , 75 They shall not return to us , the resolute , the young , 65 ‘ This is the State above the Law , 106 To-day , across our fathers ’ graves , 5 To the Judge of Right and Wrong , 35 Through learned and laborious years , 27 Try as he will , no man breaks wholly loose , 112 ‘ Twixt my house and thy house the pathway is broad , 42 We 're not so old in the Army List , 48 We thought we ranked above the chance of ill , 13 We were all one heart and one race , 6 What boots it on the Gods to call ? 58 ‘ Whence comest thou , Gehazi , 109 When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride , 128 Who in the Realm to-day lays down dear life for the sake of a land more dear ? 100 THE ROWERS</p>

    <docDate><date>1902</date>( When Germany proposed that England should help her in a naval demonstration to collect debts from Venezuela . ) The banked oars fell an hundred strong , And backed and threshed and ground , But bitter was the rowers ’ song As they brought the war-boat round . They had no heart for the rally and roar That makes the whale-bath smoke — When the great blades cleave and hold and leave As one on the racing stroke . They sang :— ‘ What reckoning do you keep , And steer her by what star , If we come unscathed from the Southern deep To be wrecked on a Baltic bar ? ‘ Last night you swore our voyage was done , But seaward still we go , And you tell us now of a secret vow You have made with an open foe ! ‘ That we must lie off a lightless coast And haul and back and veer , At the will of the breed that have wronged us most For a year and a year and a year ! ‘ There was never a shame in Christendie They laid not to our door — And you say we must take the winter sea And sail with them once more ? ‘ Look South ! The gale is scarce o'erpast That stripped and laid us down , When we stood forth but they stood fast And prayed to see us drown</docDate>
    <docImprint>‘ Our dead they mocked are scarcely cold , Our wounds are bleeding yet — And you tell us now that our strength is sold To help them press for a debt ’ ‘'Neath all the flags of all mankind That use upon the seas , Was there no other fleet to find That you strike hands with these ? ‘ Of evil times that men can choose On evil fate to fall , What brooding Judgment let you loose To pick the worst of all ? ‘ In sight of peace — from the Narrow Seas O'er half the world to run — With a cheated crew , to league anew With the Goth and the shameless Hun ! ’ THE VETERANS [ Written for the gathering of survivors of the Indian Mutiny , Albert Hall ,<date>1907</date>. ] To-day , across our fathers ’ graves , The astonished years reveal The remnant of that desperate host Which cleansed our East with steel . Hail and farewell ! We greet you here , With tears that none will scorn — O Keepers of the House of old , Or ever we were born ! One service more we dare to ask — Pray for us , heroes , pray , That when Fate lays on us our task We do not shame the Day ! THE DECLARATION OF<settlement>LONDON</settlement>JUNE 29 ,<date>1911</date>( ‘ On the re-assembling of Parliament after the Coronation , the Government have no intention of allowing their followers to vote according to their convictions on the Declaration of<settlement>London</settlement>, but insist on a strictly party vote ’ — Daily Papers . ) We were all one heart and one race When the Abbey trumpets blew . For a moment 's breathing-space We had forgotten you Now you return to your honoured place Panting to shame us anew . We have walked with the Ages dead — With our Past alive and ablaze , And you bid us pawn our honour for bread ; This day of all the days ! And you cannot wait till our guests are sped , Or last week 's wreath decays ? The light is still in our eyes Of Faith and Gentlehood , Of Service and Sacrifice , And it does not match our mood , To turn so soon to your treacheries That starve our land of her food . Our ears still carry the sound Of our once Imperial seas , Exultant after our King was crowned , Beneath the sun and the breeze . It is too early to have them bound Or sold at your decrees . Wait till the memory goes , Wait till the visions fade , We may betray in time , God knows , But we would not have it said , When you make report to our scornful foes , That we kissed as we betrayed !</docImprint>

       <l n="11">Ere men knew our tongues apart , our one task was known —</l>

     <p>THE SONS OF MARTHA</p>
     <p>The Sons of Mary seldom bother , for they have inherited that good part , But the Sons of Martha favour their Mother of the careful soul and the troubled heart . And because she lost her temper once , and because she was rude to the Lord her Guest , Her Sons must wait upon Mary 's Sons , world without end , reprieve , or rest .</p>
     <p>It is their care in all the ages to take the buffet and cushion the shock . It is their care that the gear engages ; it is their care that the switches lock . It is their care that the wheels run truly ; it is their care to embark and entrain , Tally , transport , and deliver duly the Sons of Mary by land and main .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">They say to mountains ‘ Be ye removèd . ’ They say to the lesser floods</l>
       <l n="2">‘ Be dry . ’</l>
       <l n="3">Under their rods are the rocks reprovèd — they are not afraid of that</l>
       <l n="4">which is high .</l>
       <l n="5">Then do the hill-tops shake to the summit — then is the bed of the</l>
       <l n="6">deep laid bare ,</l>
       <l n="7">That the Sons of Mary may overcome it , pleasantly sleeping and</l>
       <l n="8">unaware .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>They finger death at their gloves ’ end where they piece and repiece the living wires . He rears against the gates they rend : they feed him hungry behind their fires . Early at dawn , ere men see clear , they stumble into his terrible stall , And hale him forth like a haltered steer , and goad and turn him till evenfall .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">To these from birth is Belief forbidden ; from these till death is</l>
       <l n="2">Relief afar .</l>
       <l n="3">They are concerned with matters hidden — under the earth-line their</l>
       <l n="4">altars are .</l>
       <l n="5">The secret fountains to follow up , waters withdrawn to restore to</l>
       <l n="6">the mouth ,</l>
       <l n="7">And gather the floods as in a cup , and pour them again at a city 's</l>
       <l n="8">drouth .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>They do not preach that their God will rouse them a little before the nuts work loose . They do not teach that His Pity allows them to leave their work when they damn-well choose . As in the thronged and the lighted ways , so in the dark and the desert they stand , Wary and watchful all their days that their brethren 's days may be long in the land .</p>
