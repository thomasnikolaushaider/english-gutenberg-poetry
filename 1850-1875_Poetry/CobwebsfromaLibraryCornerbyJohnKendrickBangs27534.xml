    <head>THE MASTER ’ S PEN — A CONFESSION</head>
     <l n="1">IN my collection famed of curios</l>
     <l n="2">I have , as every bookman knows ,</l>
     <l n="3">A pen that Thackeray once used .</l>
     <l n="4">To be amused ,</l>
     <l n="5">I thought I ’ d “ take that pen in hand ,”</l>
     <l n="6">And see what came of it — what grand</l>
     <l n="7">Inspired lines ’ twould write ,</l>
     <l n="8">One Sunday night .</l>
     <l n="9">I dipped it in the ink ,</l>
     <l n="10">And tried to think ,</l>
     <l n="11">“ Just what shall I indite ?”</l>
     <l n="12">And do you know , that pen went fairly mad ;</l>
     <l n="13">A dreadful time with it I had .</l>
     <l n="14">It spluttered , spattered , scratched , and blotted so ,</l>
     <l n="15">I had to give it up , you know .</l>
     <l n="16">It really wouldn ’ t work for me ,</l>
     <l n="17">And so I put it down ; but last night , after tea ,</l>
     <l n="18">I took it up again ,</l>
     <l n="19">And equally in vain .</l>
     <l n="20">The hours sped ;</l>
     <l n="21">I went to bed ,</l>
     <l n="22">And in my dreams the pen came up to me and said :</l>
     <l n="23">“ Here is the list of Asses who have tried</l>
     <l n="24">To take up pens the master laid aside ;</l>
     <l n="25">Look thou !” I looked , and lo !— perhaps you ’ ve guessed —</l>

    <head>A LITERARY FEAST</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">MY Bookworm gave a dinner to a number of his set .</l>
     <l n="2">I was not there — I say it to my very great regret .</l>
     <l n="3">For they dined well , I fancy , if the menu that I saw</l>
     <l n="4">Was followed as implicitly as one obeys the law .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“’ Twill open ,” he observed to me , “ with quatrains on the half .</l>
     <l n="6">They go down easy ; then for soup ”— it really made me laugh —</l>
     <l n="7">“ The poems of old Johnny Gay ”— his words were rather rough —</l>
     <l n="8">“ They ’ ll do quite well , for , after all , soup ’ s thin and sloppy stuff .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ For fish , old Izaak Walton ; and to serve as an entrée ,</l>
     <l n="10">I think some fixed-up morsel , say from James , or from Daudet ;</l>
     <l n="11">The roast will be Charles Kingsley — there ’ s a deal of beef in him .</l>
     <l n="12">For sherbet , T. B. Aldrich is just suited to my whim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ For game I ’ ll have Boccaccio — he ’ s quite the proper one ;</l>
     <l n="14">He certainly is gamey , and a trifle underdone ;</l>
     <l n="15">And for the salad , Addison , so fresh and crisp is he ,</l>
     <l n="16">With just a touch of Pope to give a tang to him , you see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">“ And then for cheese , Max Nordau , for I think you ’ ll find right there</l>
     <l n="18">Some things as strong and mushy as the best of Camembert ;</l>
     <l n="19">And for dessert let Thackeray and O. Khayyám be brought ,</l>
     <l n="20">The which completes a dinner of most wondrous richness fraught .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">“ For olives and for almonds we can take the jokes of Punch —</l>
     <l n="22">They ’ re good enough for us , I think , to casually munch ;</l>
     <l n="23">And through it all we ’ ll quaff the wines that flow forever clear</l>
     <l n="24">From Avon ’ s vineyards in the heart of Will of Warwickshire .”</l>

     <l n="1">I ’ M in literary culture , and I ’ ve opened up a shop ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where I ’ d like ye , gents and ladies , if you ’ re passing by to stop .</l>
     <l n="3">Come and see my rich assortment of fine literary seed</l>
     <l n="4">That I ’ m selling to the writers of full many a modern screed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I ’ ve bacilli for ten volumes for a dollar , in a bag —</l>
     <l n="6">Not a single germ among ’ em that ’ s been ever known to drag .</l>
     <l n="7">Not a single germ among ’ em , if you see they ’ re planted right ,</l>
     <l n="8">But will grow into a novel that they ’ ll say is out of sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I have motifs by the thousand , motifs sad and motifs gay .</l>
     <l n="10">You can buy ’ em by the dozen , or I ’ ll serve ’ em every day :</l>
     <l n="11">I will serve ’ em in the morning , as the milkman serves his wares ;</l>
     <l n="12">I will serve ’ em by the postman , or I ’ ll leave ’ em on your stairs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">When you get down to your table with your head a vacuum ,</l>
     <l n="14">You can say unto your helpmeet , “ Has that quart of ideas come</l>
     <l n="15">That we ordered served here daily from that plot-man down the street ?”</l>
     <l n="16">And you ’ ll find that I ’ ve been early my engagement to complete .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Should you want a book of poems that will bring you into fame ,</l>
     <l n="18">Let me send a sample packet that will guarantee the same ,</l>
     <l n="19">Holding “ Seeds of Thought from Byron , Herrick , Chaucer , Tennyson .”</l>
     <l n="20">Plant ’ em deep , and keep ’ em watered , and you ’ ll find the deed is done .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">I ’ ve a hundred comic packets that would make a Twain of Job ;</l>
     <l n="22">I have “ Seeds of Tales Narcotic ; Tales of Surgeons and the Probe .”</l>
     <l n="23">I ’ ve a most superb assortment , on the very cheapest terms ,</l>
     <l n="24">Done up carefully in tin-foil , of my A 1 “ Trilby Germs .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">So perchance if you ’ re ambitious in a literary line ,</l>
     <l n="26">Be as dull as e ’ er you can be , you will surely cut a shine ,</l>
     <l n="27">If you ’ ll only take advantage of this opportunity ,</l>
     <l n="28">When you ’ re passing by to stop in for a little chat with me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">You may ask me , in conclusion , why I do not seek myself</l>
     <l n="30">All the laurel and the glory of these seeds I sell for pelf .</l>
     <l n="31">I will tell you , though the confidence I can ’ t deny is rash ,</l>
     <l n="32">I ’ m a trifle long on laurels , and a little short of cash .</l>

     <l n="3">Charles Dickens , too , has pleased me quite a lot ,</l>
     <l n="4">As also have both Stevenson and Scott .</l>
     <l n="5">I like Dumas and Balzac , and I think</l>
     <l n="6">Lord Byron quite a dab at spreading ink ;</l>

     <l n="13">A richly pictured set of Avon ’ s bard</l>
