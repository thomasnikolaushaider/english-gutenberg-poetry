     <l n="7">To the smile on your lip , and your questioning eye ,</l>
     <l n="8">That the work was begun</l>
     <l n="9">In a spirit of fun ,</l>
     <l n="10">To amuse when the work of the daylight was done ;</l>
     <l n="11">And continued , because we believed it would be</l>
     <l n="12">Amusement to such as were weary as we</l>
     <l n="13">To drift for awhile among goblins and elves ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or haply make shadows and rhymes for themselves .</l>
     <l n="15">For though years have passed since we drifted apart ,</l>
     <l n="16">We 're all of us more or less children at heart .</l>
     <l n="17">And maybe yourselves and the youngsters ‘ t will please</l>

    <head>THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM .</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Drop a little ink on a sheet of white paper . Fold the sheet in the center and press the ink-spots together with the fingers . All of the pictures in this book were made in this manner —— none of them having been touched with a pen or brush .</p>
   <p>A great deal of practice will only go to show that the Gobolink , as his name implies , is a veritable goblin of the ink-bottle , and the way he eludes the artist 's design proves him a self-made eccentric creature of a superior imagination .</p>
   <p>It is hardly to be expected that the animals and birds of prey referred to under more or less familiar names in the accompanying rhymes will be strikingly correct as to anatomy ; and because , as upon page 15 , the elephants , or whatever they may be , happen to have each a row of interesting tails continuing along the full length of the spinal column , no unkind criticism should be made upon the ability of the overworked and conscientious artists , who would have made fewer tails if they could , and have added nothing to the price of the book on account of undue liberality in the matter of caudal appendages .</p>

   <p>In fact the most unexpected and startling results will often occur — results grotesquely and strangely beautiful , well worthy of preservation . The authors of this book will be glad to receive a few examples of some of the more unusual Gobolinks or Shadow-Pictures that may occur to those interested in the amusement . They may be sent care of The Century Co .</p>

    <head>THE GAME OF GOBOLINK .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Persons of all ages may obtain amusement out of Gobolinks , or</l>
     <l n="2">Shadow-Pictures , as they are also called .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">[ Illustration ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">The following is a very good method for playing the game :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Let three of the company be selected by the hostess as judges . To each of the others she then distributes from five to ten sheets of paper , from which they must produce at least one completed picture and rhyme in a given length of time , say five minutes , at the end of which the hostess rings a bell and the judges proceed at once to take up the pictures . These are then passed upon by them while the hostess is distributing a fresh round of paper , and the best two and the worst one are laid aside .</p>
   <p>Those whose pictures have been selected now act as judges , surrendering their places at the tables to their predecessors , and another lot of pictures and rhymes are made .</p>
   <p>The game is continued in this manner until the hostess announces the arrival of the time for final judgment , or until a certain hour specified in the beginning .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The three judges then in office now select one of the company as “ reader , ” and such person selected shall take up his position in strong light , and after reading the verses on each picture shall display it in full view of all present . It should then be pinned to a suspended sheet or screen where it may be easily examined by the company .</p>
   <p>This shall be continued until all the pictures selected by the judges have been so treated and displayed . The reader then acts as chairman , and the company proceed to vote on them for first , second , and booby prizes .</p>
   <p>The Gobolink receiving second largest number of votes for first prize is awarded second . The ballot for booby should be , of course , taken separately . Pictures should be signed or otherwise identified .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Where a number are making the pictures , it is well to seat them around a large table with the ink-supply in the center .</p>
   <p>Jet-black ink should be used , and a good quality of unglazed paper . The ink should not be too thin .</p>
   <p>The table should be protected from accident with several thicknesses of newspaper .</p>
   <p>A filled pen or tincture-dropper may be used for supplying the ink .</p>
   <p>For a specially invited Gobolink party the company may dress in any grotesque fashion , remembering only that both sides of their costume shall be the same , this being a feature peculiar to Gobolink attire .</p>
   <p>No game could be more productive of amusement than Gobolink .</p>
