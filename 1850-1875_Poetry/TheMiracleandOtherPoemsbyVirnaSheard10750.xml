      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Up from the templed city of the Jews ,</l>
       <l n="3">The road ran straight and white</l>
       <l n="4">To Jericho , the City of the Palms ,</l>
       <l n="5">The City of Delight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">Down that still road from far Judean hills</l>
       <l n="7">The shepherds drove their sheep</l>
       <l n="8">At silver dawn — at stirring of the birds —</l>
       <l n="9">When men were all asleep .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Full many went that weary way at noon ,</l>
       <l n="11">Or rested by the trees ,</l>
       <l n="12">Romans and slaves , Gentiles and bearded priests ,</l>
       <l n="13">Sinners and Pharisees .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">But when the pink clouds drifted far and high ,</l>
       <l n="15">Like rose leaves blowing past ,</l>
       <l n="16">When in the west where one star blessed the sky</l>
       <l n="17">The gates of day shut fast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">All travellers journeyed home , and the moonlight</l>
       <l n="19">Washed the road fresh and sweet ,</l>
       <l n="20">Until it seemed a gleaming ivory path ,</l>
       <l n="21">Waiting for royal feet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">Now it was noon , and life at its full tide</l>
       <l n="23">Rolled ever to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="24">A restless sea , between Jerusalem</l>
       <l n="25">And white-walled Jericho .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="26">Blind Bartimeus , by the highway side ,</l>
       <l n="27">Sat begging ‘ neath the trees ,</l>
       <l n="28">And heard the world go by , Gentiles and Jews ,</l>
       <l n="29">Sinners and Pharisees .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="30">Blind Bartimeus of the mask-like face ,</l>
       <l n="31">And patient , outstretched hand —</l>
       <l n="32">He upon whom his God had set a mark</l>
       <l n="33">No man might understand ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="34">Blind Bartimeus of the lonely dark ,</l>
       <l n="35">Who knew no thing called fear ,</l>
       <l n="36">But dreamt his dreams , and heard the little sounds</l>
       <l n="37">No man but he could hear .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="38">He heard the beating of the bird 's soft wings</l>
       <l n="39">Uprising through the air ;</l>
       <l n="40">He heard the camel 's footfall in the dust ,</l>
       <l n="41">And knew who travelled there .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="42">He heard the lizard when it moved at noon</l>
       <l n="43">On the grey , sunlit wall ;</l>
       <l n="44">He heard the far-off temple bells , what time</l>
       <l n="45">He felt the shadows fall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="46">Now , in the golden hour , he stooped to hear</l>
       <l n="47">A muffled sound and low ,</l>
       <l n="48">The tramping of a myriad sandalled feet</l>
       <l n="49">That came from Jericho .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="50">Then on the road a little lad he knew</l>
       <l n="51">Ran past , with eager cry ,</l>
       <l n="52">“ Ho , Bartimeus ! Give thine heart good cheer ,</l>
       <l n="53">For David 's Son comes by !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="54">“ He comes ! He comes ! And , sad one , who can say</l>
       <l n="55">What He may do for thee ?</l>
       <l n="56">He makes the lame to walk ! He heals the sick !</l>
       <l n="57">He makes the blind to see ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="58">“ He makes the blind to see ! Oh , God of Hosts ,</l>
       <l n="59">Beyond the sky called blue ,</l>
       <l n="60">What if Messiah cometh to His own !</l>
       <l n="61">What if the words be true ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="62">On his swift way the little herald sped ,</l>
       <l n="63">Like bird upon the wing ,</l>
       <l n="64">And left the lean , brown beggar — world-forgot —</l>
       <l n="65">Waiting for Israel 's King .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="66">But when the dust came whirling to his feet —</l>
       <l n="67">When the mad throng drew near —</l>
       <l n="68">Blind Bartimeus rose , and from his lips</l>
       <l n="69">A cry rang loud and clear —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="70">The cry of all the ages , of each soul</l>
       <l n="71">In sad captivity ;</l>
       <l n="72">The endless cry from depths of bitter woe —</l>
       <l n="73">“ Have mercy upon me ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="74">What though the wild oncoming multitude</l>
       <l n="75">Jested and bade him cease ;</l>
       <l n="76">What though the Scribes and mighty Pharisees</l>
       <l n="77">Told him to keep his peace ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="78">What though his heart grew faint , and all the strength</l>
       <l n="79">Slipped from each trembling limb —</l>
       <l n="80">The One of all the earth his soul desired</l>
       <l n="81">Stood still — and spoke to him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="82">Then silence fell , while the upheaving throng ,</l>
       <l n="83">As sea-waves backward curled ,</l>
       <l n="84">Left a great path , and down the path there shone</l>
       <l n="85">The Light of all the world .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="86">The Light from whose mysterious golden depths</l>
       <l n="87">The Sun rose in his might —</l>
       <l n="88">The light from whose white , hidden fires were lit</l>
       <l n="89">The torches of the night ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="24">
       <l n="90">The Light that shining on a thing of clay</l>
       <l n="91">Giveth it Life and Will :</l>
       <l n="92">The Light that with an unknown power can blast</l>
       <l n="93">And bid all life be still ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="25">
       <l n="94">The Light that calls a ray of its own light</l>
       <l n="95">A man 's undying soul —</l>
       <l n="96">The Light that lifts the broken lives of earth ,</l>
       <l n="97">Touches and makes them whole .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="26">
       <l n="98">Up towards the Radiance Bartimeus went ,</l>
       <l n="99">Alone , and poor , and blind —</l>
       <l n="100">Feeling his way , if haply it led on</l>
       <l n="101">To One he fain would find .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="27">
       <l n="102">Then spoke the Voice again . Oh , mystic words</l>
       <l n="103">Of a compelling grace :</l>
       <l n="104">The curtain rose from off his darkened sight —</l>
       <l n="105">He saw the King 's own face .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="28">
       <l n="106">So strangely beautiful — so strangely near —</l>
       <l n="107">He worshipped with his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="108">Unheeding that for him at last there shone</l>
       <l n="109">The sunlit noonday skies .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="29">
       <l n="110">What though the clamouring crowd echoed his name</l>
       <l n="111">Unto its utmost rim ,</l>
       <l n="112">He only saw the Christ — and in the light</l>
       <l n="113">He rose and followed Him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="30">
       <l n="114">Oh , Bartimeus of the mask-like face ,</l>

       <l n="1">Hail , little herald !— Art thou then returning</l>
       <l n="2">From summer lands , this wild and wind-torn day ?</l>
       <l n="3">Hast brought the word for which our hearts are yearning ,</l>
       <l n="4">That spring is on the way ?</l>
       <l n="5">Hark ! Now there comes a clear , insistent calling ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">From hill tops crested with untarnished snow ;</l>
       <l n="7">The trumpet notes are drifting — floating — falling —</l>

       <l n="24">What time the skies are blue .</l>
       <l n="25">When robins from the apple-trees are flinging</l>
       <l n="26">Out on the air their silver shower of song ,—</l>

       <l n="11">While bobolinks will whistle through the days ,</l>

       <l n="13">When April comes , the world so wise and old ,</l>

      <head>HALLOWE'EN</head>
      <head>There is an old Italian legend which says that on the eve of the beloved festival of All Saints ( Hallowe'en ) the souls of the dead return to earth for a little while and go by on the wind . The feast of All Saints is followed by the feast of the dead , when for a day only the sound of the Miserere is heard throughout the cities of Italy .</head>

       <l n="1">Hark ! Hark to the wind ! ‘ Tis the night , they say ,</l>
       <l n="2">When all souls come back from the far away —</l>
       <l n="3">The dead , forgotten this many a day !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">And the dead remembered — ay ! long and well —</l>

       <l n="6">In God 's green garden of asphodel .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Have you reached the country of all content , 0 souls we know , since the day you went From this time-worn world , where your years were spent ?</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Would you come back to the sun and the rain ,</l>
       <l n="2">The sweetness , the strife , the thing we call pain ,</l>
       <l n="3">And then unravel life 's tangle again ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I lean to the dark — Hush !— was it a sigh ? Or the painted vine-leaves that rustled by ? Or only a night-bird 's echoing cry ?</p>

     <head>JEAN DE BREBOEUF</head>
     <p>Jean de Breboeuf , a priest of the Jesuit Order , came to Canada as a missionary to the Indians about the year 1625 . He belonged to an old and honourable French family that had given many sons to the army , and was a man of great physical strength , one who possessed an iron will , that was yet combined with sweetness and gentleness of temper .</p>
     <p>He lived with the Indians for many years , and spoke the dialects of different tribes , though his mission was chiefly to the Hurons . By them he was much beloved .</p>
     <p>At the time of the uprising of the Iroquois in 1649 , there was a massacre of the Hurons at the little mission village of St. Louis upon the shores of Georgian Bay . There Jean de Breboeuf , refusing to leave his people , met death by torture at the hands of the conquering Iroquois . Lalement , his friend , a priest of the same order , was also martyred by these Indians upon the same day , March 16th , 1649 .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">As Jean de Breboeuf told his rosary</l>

       <l n="4">Breaking the beauty of tranquillity —</l>
       <l n="5">Down from the heart of Heaven it seemed to fall :</l>

       <l n="6">“ Hail , Jean de Breboeuf ! Lift thee to thy feet !</l>
       <l n="7">Not , for thy sins , by prayer shalt thou atone ;</l>
       <l n="8">Thou wert not made for peace so deeply sweet ,</l>
       <l n="9">Thine be the midnight cold , the noonday heat ,</l>

      <head>IN EGYPT</head>
      <head>It was the Angel Azrael the Lord God sent below At midnight , into every house in Egypt , long ago — 0 long , and long ago .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">All day the wife of Pharaoh had paced the palace hall</l>
       <l n="2">Or the long white pillared court that was open to the sky ;</l>
       <l n="3">A passion of wild restlessness ensnared her in its thrall</l>
       <l n="4">While she fought a fear within her — a thing that would not die .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">She had sent away her maidens — their weeping vexed her ears —</l>
       <l n="6">Their pallid faces filled her with impatient pitying scorn ;—</l>
       <l n="7">But she kept one time-worn woman , who long had outgrown fears ,</l>
       <l n="8">The old brown nurse who held her son the day that he was born .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">The mighty gods had failed her — the river-gods and the sun ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the little gods of brass and stone — who stared but made no sign ,</l>
       <l n="11">So she pled with them no longer , her prayers were said and done ,</l>
       <l n="12">And now she neither bowed her head , or knelt at any shrine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Her hair was blown upon the wind like wreathes of golden flame ,</l>
       <l n="14">And the sea-blue of her eyes cast blue shadows on her face ,</l>
       <l n="15">For she was not of Egypt — but unto the king she came</l>
       <l n="16">A captive — yet a princess — from a northern sea-bound place .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">She watched the fiery wheel roll down behind the level land ,</l>
       <l n="18">One small hand curled above her eyes , and one above her heart ,</l>
       <l n="19">But when the ruby afterglow crept up and stained the sand</l>
       <l n="20">She turned and gazed toward Goshen , where Israel dwelt apart .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Nine plagues had wasted Egypt with their tortures grim and slow ;</l>
       <l n="22">The earth was desolated , and scarred by hail and fire ;</l>
       <l n="23">Still even yet her Lord refused to let his bondsmen go</l>
       <l n="24">To worship in the wilderness , the God of their desire .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">The yellow Nile had turned to blood before her watching eyes —</l>

       <l n="27">The very dust upon the street the rod had made to rise</l>
       <l n="28">In a living moving horror , of atoms , leprous-white .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">The frogs had come as things bewitched ; an army without fear</l>

       <l n="31">And each one followed steadily a voice no man could hear —</l>
       <l n="32">While poisoned wind and pestilence came swiftly in their wake .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Then oh , the little flies that swarmed from out the earth and air !</l>
       <l n="34">And the murrain of the camels , and cattle in the field !</l>
       <l n="35">She prayed the king for love of her to hear the people 's prayer</l>
       <l n="36">And send the slaves far hither ;— but for love he would not yield .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">His face was like the carven face upon the basalt door ;—</l>
       <l n="38">Her beauty could not charm him , her voice had lost its power ;</l>
       <l n="39">So she wrapped a veil about her and entreated him no more</l>
       <l n="40">But sat alone and watched , from out her window in the tower .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">She saw the Hebrew leader with uncovered silvery hair</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">But naught prevailed , for sore disease had scourged the low and high ,</l>
       <l n="46">And the hail of God had fallen and crushed the growing grain ,</l>
       <l n="47">And a fire no hand had kindled in searing wrath swept by —</l>
       <l n="48">Such fire as none had seen before — as none would see again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="49">Then came the pirate locusts , with a sea-song free and bold ;—</l>
       <l n="50">The spent and broken people lacked the strength to force them back ,</l>
       <l n="51">But watched them take the last green blades that never would be gold —</l>
       <l n="52">And shut their doors against the foe that turned the meadows black .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="53">Then Pharaoh wavered — more — he called the Hebrews in his haste</l>
       <l n="54">Imploring respite — pleading his repentance bitterly —</l>
       <l n="55">For there was death on every side , and all the land was waste ;—</l>
       <l n="56">So the western wind of God blew the locusts out to sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="57">Yet not enough . Once more the king denied his given word ;</l>
       <l n="58">He dared the wrath of Heaven , and he made his heart as steel ;</l>
       <l n="59">Then all the lights of God went out , and no man even stirred —</l>
       <l n="60">But stayed companioned by his fear , in darkness he could feel .</l>
