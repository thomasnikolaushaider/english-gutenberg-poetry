      <p>THE QUALITY OF THE WORKS OF EDWARD DOYLE The quality of Edward Doyle 's work was appraised by Ella Wheeler Wilcox in the following article by Mrs. Wilcox which appeared in the New York Evening Journal and the San Francisco Examiner , in 1905 :</p>
     </div>
    </front>
    <body>
     <p>Shut your eyes and bind them with a black cloth and try for one hour to see how cheerful you can be . Then imagine yourself deprived for life of the light of day .</p>
     <p>Perhaps this experiment will make you less rebellious with your present lot .</p>
     <p>Then take the little book called “ The Haunted Temple and Other Poems , ” by Edward Doyle , the blind poet of Harlem , and read and wonder and feel ashamed of any mood of distrust of God and discontent with life you have ever indulged .</p>
     <p>Mr. Doyle has been blind for the last thirty-seven years ; he has lived a half century .</p>
     <p>Therefore he still remembers the privilege of seeing God 's world when a lad , and this must augment rather than ameliorate his sorrow .</p>
     <p>He who has never known the use of eyes cannot fully understand the immensity of the loss of sight .</p>
     <p>I hear people in possession of all their senses , and with many blessings , bewail the fact that they were ever born .</p>
     <p>They have missed some aim , failed of some cherished ambition , lost some special joy or been defeated in some purpose .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>A GREAT SOUL</head>
      <head>And so they sit in spiritual darkness and curse life and doubt God . But here is a great soul who has found his divine self in the darkness and who sends out this wonderful song of joy and gratitude .</head>
       <l n="1">Read it , oh , ye weak repiners , and read it again and again . It is</l>
       <l n="2">beautiful in thought , perfect in expression and glorious with truth .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>CHIME , DARK BELL</head>
       <l n="1">My life is in deep darkness ; still , I cry ,</l>
       <l n="2">With joy to my Creator , “ It is well ! ”</l>
       <l n="3">Were worlds my words , what firmaments would tell</l>
       <l n="4">My transport at the consciousness that I</l>
       <l n="5">Who was not , Am ! To be — oh , that is why</l>
       <l n="6">The awful convex dark in which I dwell</l>
       <l n="7">Is tongued with joy , and chimes a temple bell .</l>
       <l n="8">Antiphonally to the choirs on high !</l>
       <l n="9">Chime cheerily , dark bell ! for were no more</l>
       <l n="10">Than consciousness my gift , this were to know</l>
       <l n="11">The Giver Good — which sums up all the lore</l>
       <l n="12">Eternity can possibly bestow .</l>
       <l n="13">Chime ! for thy metal is the molten ore</l>
       <l n="14">Of the great stars , and marks no wreck below .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I know a gifted and brilliant man in New York who is full of charm and wit in conversation , but the moment he touches a pen he becomes , as a rule , a melancholy pessimist , crying out at the injustice of the world and the uselessness of high endeavor in the field of art .</p>
     <p>When urged to take a different mental attitude for the sake of the reading world , which needs strong tonics of hope and courage , rather than the slow poison of pessimism , however subtly sweet the brew , my friend responds that “ The song and dance of literature is not my special gift . ” And he is obliged to “ speak of the world as I find it . ”</p>
     <p>He is an able-bodied man , in the prime of life , with splendid years waiting on his threshold to lead him to any height he may wish to climb . But to his mental vision , nothing is really “ worth while . ”</p>
     <p>What a rebuke this wonderful poem of Edward Doyle 's should be to all such men and women . What an inspiration it should be to every mortal who reads it , to look within , and find the = Kingdom of God = as this blind poet has found it .</p>
     <p>Mr. Doyle was in St. Francis Xavier 's College when his great affliction fell upon him . He started a local paper , The Advocate , in Harlem twenty-three years ago and has in the darkness of his physical vision developed his poetical talent and given the world some great lines .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>AN INSPIRATION</head>
       <l n="1">Here is a poem which throbs with the keen anguish which must have been</l>
       <l n="2">his guest through many silent hours of these thirty-seven years :</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>TO A CHILD READING</head>
       <l n="1">My darling , spell the words out . You may creep</l>
       <l n="2">Across the syllables on hands and knees ,</l>
       <l n="3">And stumble often , yet pass me with ease</l>
       <l n="4">And reach the spring upon the summit steep .</l>
       <l n="5">Oh , I could lay me down , dear child , and weep</l>
       <l n="6">These charr 'd orbs out , but that you then might cease</l>
       <l n="7">Your upward effort , and with inquiries</l>
       <l n="8">Stoop down and probe my heart too deep , too deep !</l>
       <l n="9">I thirst for Knowledge . Oh , for an endless drink</l>
       <l n="10">Your goblet leaks the whole way from the spring —</l>
       <l n="11">No matter , to its rim a few drops cling ,</l>
       <l n="12">And these refresh me with the joy to think</l>
       <l n="13">That you , my darling , have the morning 's wing</l>
       <l n="14">To cross the mountain at whose base I sink .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>But Edward Doyle has not sunk “ at the mountain 's base . ” He is far up its summit , and he will go higher . He has found God , and nothing can hinder his flight . He is an inspiration to all struggling , toiling souls on earth .</p>
     <p>As I read his book , with its strong clarion cry of faith and joy and courage , and ponder over the carefully finished thoughts and beautifully polished lines , I feel ashamed of my own small achievements , and am inspired to new efforts .</p>
     <p>Glory and success to you , Edward Doyle .</p>

      <head>THE JEWS IN RUSSIA</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">From town and village to a wood , stript bare ,</l>
       <l n="2">As they of their possessions , see them throng .</l>
       <l n="3">Above them grows a cloud ; it moves along ,</l>
       <l n="4">As flee they from the circling wolf pack 's glare .</l>
       <l n="5">Is it their Brocken-Shadow of despair ,</l>
       <l n="6">The looming of their life of cruel wrong</l>
       <l n="7">For countless ages ? No ; their faith is strong</l>
       <l n="8">In their Jehovah ; that huge cloud is prayer .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">A flash of light , and black the despot lies .</l>
       <l n="10">What thunder round the world ! ‘ Tis transport 's strain</l>
       <l n="11">Proclaiming loud : “ No righteous prayer is vain</l>
       <l n="12">No God-imploring tears are lost ; they rise</l>
       <l n="13">Into a cloud , and in the sky remain</l>
       <l n="14">Till they draw lightening from Jehovah 's eyes . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The author of this superb little gem , like Homer , is blind ; but , like Homer , his mental vision is clear , and broad , and deep . President Schurman , of Cornell University , commenting on Doyle once said : “ It is as true today as of yore that the genuine poet , even though blind , is the Seer and Prophet of his generation . ” The poem here printed illustrates the point . Did we not know that it was published some fifteen years ago in a volume entitled “ The Haunted Temple , ” we should assume that it was written on the occasion of the fall of the Czar . In fact , however , it merely foretells this event by some dozen years . And how terribly applicable are the lines to the facts of today ! The prophecy is one capable of repeated fulfillment .</p>
     <p>But it is as a prophet of nationalism that this man compels our particular attention . The prophecy is embodied in a play entitled “ The Comet , a Play of Our Times , ” brought out as far back as 1908 . The play is a microcosm of American life . The chief character is a college president , and he it is that is chosen to expound the true nature of nationalism and to give voice and utterance to the principle of self-determination . ( Is it merely a coincidence that at that time Woodrow Wilson was President of Princeton , or is it a case of poetic vision . Wilson , be it remembered , was already a national figure , and there were already glimmerings that he was destined to usher in a new era in politics . ) According to the protagonist , America is not “ a boiling cauldron in which the elements seethe , but never settle , ” but rather a college where every class is taught to translate —</p>

       <l n="3">and any body of citizens form a part of our republic only in so far —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">“ As they contribute to its character</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">We must lead the peoples of the world to freedom . And what is freedom ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="8">“ ‘ Tis intelligence</l>
       <l n="9">Aloof from harm and hamper , grandly circling</l>
       <l n="10">Its native sun-lit peaks , the highest hopes</l>
       <l n="11">Heaved from the heart of man upon the earth ,</l>
       <l n="12">In ranges long as time and soul endure . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="13">What , then , is America 's duty to the oppressed race or the small nation ?</l>
       <l n="14">It is to “ wake and disabuse it of false hope ” —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="15">“ and urge it on</l>

       <l n="19">By which a tribe can thrive to its perfection . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>To make this possible , civilization must be given a more human content . It is therefore necessary to awake human intelligence , “ the godlike genius , ” to a realization of the fact —</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ — that , on having brought</l>
       <l n="2">This world from out the chaos dark</l>

       <l n="5">Must providence its beautiful creation</l>
       <l n="6">With altruistic love and tenderness ;</l>
       <l n="7">So that all tribes of man , what'er their hue ,</l>
       <l n="8">Have each a hill where it can touch the star</l>
       <l n="9">That it has followed with its mental growth . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">Such a program is rendered imperative by the inexorability of the law</l>
       <l n="11">of race , which nullifies any attempts to force assimilation :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="12">“ It is a foolish , futile thing</l>

       <l n="16">Proclaiming certain territory hers</l>
       <l n="17">And warning all encroaching powers therefrom ,</l>
       <l n="18">Without the ordering out of her reserves</l>
       <l n="19">To see to it the edict is enforced .</l>
       <l n="20">Let politics keep off forbidden shores . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="21">If any powers preserve in a policy of oppression , our duty is plain :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="22">“ To teach the barbarous tribes throughout the globe ,</l>

       <l n="1">( From the “ Independent , ” May 30 , 1912 . )</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The scene of Mr. Edward Doyle 's new play is the Florence of 1400 ; the atmosphere that of a plague stricken city in a time when man was helpless , authorities hopeless , social life in shreds and patches . The plot of the play founded on this state of affairs is rich in incident , varied and sufficiently complex in color , passion and character to furnish material for an exciting spectacular representation . The tragic element is strong , but supported and shaded by the company of roysterers , a jester , whose foolery is a compound of bluff of that period and bluff of modern politics and athletics . The jester , the black company and the penitents , together with the roysterers , form now the foreground , now the background , of action , which in itself is never without the dolorous sound of the death bell . The doomed city is under a spell comparable to that set forth so vividly in Manzoni 's “ I Promessi Sposi . ” Says the villain of the plot as he listens from his seat at the festive board :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ It bodes ill for the black Cowled company</l>
       <l n="2">To make a visit to a festive house .</l>
       <l n="3">‘ Tis like death looking in and whispering ‘ Next . ’</l>
       <l n="4">Fool , call the servants . Bid them fetch the wine —</l>
       <l n="5">A cask of it — the best varnaccio !</l>
       <l n="6">Here come my friends to help me drown the Plague . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Pictures like this as sharply defined are frequent and throw in shadowed blackening on shadow . The author defends the use of a meteorological phenomenon translated in the spirit of the time as supernatural by quoting Dante as recognizing it , but the authority of Dante was not necessary to justify the dramatist in introducing the “ Crimson Cross . ” It was a part of the pyrotechnics of the church propaganda . Though the advance of scientific discovery has laid a heavy hand on thaumaturgy of the sort , it would no doubt , have its use when properly handled on a modern stage . The action of the drama is rapid and natural , the characters well drawn and individualized , the dialogue spicy , forceful and varied .</p>
