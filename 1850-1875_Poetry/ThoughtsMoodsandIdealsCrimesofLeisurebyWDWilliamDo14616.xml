   <head>THE CONFUSED DAWN .</head>
   <p>YOUNG MAN What are the Vision and the Cry That haunt the new Canadian soul ? Dim grandeur spreads we know not why O'er mountain , forest , tree and knoll , And murmurs indistinctly fly .— Some magic moment sure is nigh . O Seer , the curtain roll !</p>
   <p>SEER The Vision , mortal , it is this — Dead mountain , forest , knoll and tree Awaken all endued with bliss , A native land — O think !— to be — Thy native land — and ne'er amiss , Its smile shall like a lover 's kiss From henceforth seem to thee .</p>

   <p>CANADA NOT LAST .</p>
   <p>AT VENICE Lo ! Venice , gay with color , lights and song , Calls from St. Mark 's with ancient voice and strange : I am the Witch of Cities ! glide along My silver streets that never wear by change Of years : forget the years , and pain , and wrong , And every sorrow reigning men among . Know I can soothe thee , please and marry thee To my illusions . Old and siren-strong , I smile immortal , while the mortals flee Who whiten on to death in wooing me .</p>
   <p>AT FLORENCE Say , what more fair , by Arno 's bridgéd gleam , [ A ] Than Florence , viewed from San Miniato 's slope At eventide , when west along the stream , The last of day reflects a silver hope !— Lo , all else softened in the twilight beam :— The city 's mass blent in one hazy cream , The brown Dome midst it , and the Lily tower , And stern Old Tower more near , and hills that seem Afar , like clouds to fade , and hills of power , On this side , greenly dark with cypress , vine and bower .</p>
   <p>AT ROME End of desire to stray I feel would come Though Italy were all fair skies to me , Though France 's fields went mad with flowery foam And Blanc put on a special majesty . Not all could match the growing thought of home Nor tempt to exile . Look I not on ROME — This ancient , modern , mediæval queen — Yet still sigh westward over hill and dome , Imperial ruin and villa 's princely scene Lovely with pictured saints and marble gods serene .</p>
   <p>REFLECTION Rome , Florence , Venice — noble , fair and quaint , They reign in robes of magic round me here ; But fading , blotted , dim , a picture faint , With spell more silent , only pleads a tear . Plead not ! Thou hast my heart , O picture dim ! I see the fields , I see the autumn hand Of God upon the maples ! Answer Him With weird , translucent glories , ye that stand Like spirits in scarlet and in amethyst ! I see the sun break over you ; the mist On hills that lift from iron bases grand Their heads superb !— the dream , it is my native land .</p>

     <l n="9">Some wall might yield and I behold again</l>

   <p>THE KNIGHT ERRANT .</p>
   <p>CLOUD TO WIND O blow , blow high , for I descend ; Friend must go to meet his friend , If to earth you tie your feet You and I will never meet .</p>
   <p>WIND Nay , I haste . A trifle wait ; I exceed my usual gait . Ha ! this hill-top is sublime , But it makes me pant to climb .</p>
   <p>CLOUD Once again , a little space , Meet we in this Alpine place , Before you leap adown the vale Or I along my pathway sail .</p>
   <p>WIND Then let our little bell of time Ring onward with a chatty chime — How we have fled o'er earth and sky , And what you saw and what saw I .</p>
   <p>CLOUD O , I from off my couch serene , Woods , meadows , towns and seas have seen ; And in one wood , beside a cave , A hermit kneeling by a grave :— The which I felt so touched to see I wept a shower of sympathy . And in one mead I saw , methought , A brave , dark-armored knight , who fought A shining-dragon in a mist , That , mixed with flames did roll and twist Out of the beast 's red mouth — a breath Of choking , blinding , sulphurous death , On which I shot my thickest rain And made the conflict fair again . And from one town I heard the swell Of a loud , melancholy bell , That past me rose in flames of sound And up to Saint Cecilia wound . And on one sea I saw a ship Bend out its full-fed sails and slip So light , so gladly o'er the tide I could not help but look inside — Its passengers were groom and bride . I floated o'er them snowily , They felt my beauty in the sky , Their eyes , their souls , their joy were one , I would not cross their happy sun . I love this life of calm and use — No bonds but windy ribbons loose , No gifts to ask but all to give , Secure Elysium fugitive .</p>
   <p>WIND Your life , though , drinks not half the wine Of active gladness that doth mine ; I spread my wings and stretch my arms Over a dozen hedgéd farms ; I breast steep hills , through pine-groves rush , Rock birds ’ nests , yet no fledgling crush , Tossing the grain-fields everywhere , The trees , the grass , the school-girl 's hair , Whirling away her laugh the while — ( We breezes love the children 's smile ) ; And then I lag and wander down Among the roofs and dust of town , Bearing cool draughts from lake and moor To fan the faces of the poor , While sick babes , stifled half to death , Grow rosy at my country breath . I lent a shoulder to your ship ; I moaned with that sad hermit 's lip ; I helped disperse the dragon 's mist ; And some bell 's voice , ‘ twas yours I wist , I handed up to winds on high Who wing a loftier flight than I . But , hark ! a rider leaves the vale .</p>
   <p>CLOUD Ah , yes , I catch the gleam of mail .</p>
   <p>RANDOLPH O speak again ye voicéd ghosts ! I heard afar your cheerful boasts . And , if I doubt not , ye are they That here have met me many a day .</p>
   <p>WIND We are they .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">CLOUD , ( echoing )</l>
     <l n="2">We are they .</l>
     <l n="3">But whither now doth Randolph stray ,</l>
     <l n="4">And why the mail , and why the steed ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>RANDOLPH This is my father 's mail indeed , Bequeathed with message to his son : “ Stand straight in it and yield to none . ”</p>
   <p>WIND But whither off and why away ?</p>
   <p>RANDOLPH Off to the world ; I cannot stay — That world I have so often viewed Here from this upper solitude — This bulwark barring strife and trade . Love calls me off . I love a maid , Loving her silently and long , Learning for her to hate the wrong , Learning for her to seek the right , To hew at sloth and faint resolve And thoughts that round but self revolve , And pray for grace and virtue — wings That bear men to the highest things , Enwrapt and rising into light . For her , for her , O Cloud and Wind ! I trained my limbs and taught my mind , Ran , wrestled , clomb , and learned to bend The cross-bow with each village friend ; And by my hermit-guardian spent The earliest dimness morning lent , And the faint torch that evening bore , In science and in saintly lore , Reading the stars and signs of rain , Noting each tree and herb and grain ; Each bird that flutters through the leaves , Each beast , each fish that green lake cleaves , The curious deeds Devotion paints In missals and in lives of saints , And every olden subtle trick Of grammar , logic , rhetoric . But most on chivalry I turned A torrent eagerness , and burned To hear of wrong repaired , or read The working of some famous deed , Like those I dreamt that I could do When what I set myself was through : Vexed lest the inward clock of fate That ticked “ Too soon ! ” might tick “ Too late ! ” But now that dial points the hour When I must test my gathered power , And leave my books and leave my dreams Of steeds and towers and knightly themes , Of tourney gay and woodland quest , Of Perceval and Perceforest , Of Richard , Arthur , Charlemain , Amadis and the Cid of Spain — Must leave them all and seek alone Some grand adventure of my own .</p>
   <p>CLOUD Yet if you seek and cannot find Or fail to work what you designed , Be it but as the steadfast sun Who bright or dim his course doth run , And last doth reach as far a spot Whether he seems to shine or not .</p>
   <p>RANDOLPH The height , the fynial of my aim Is to be worthy of her name .</p>
   <p>CLOUD You mortals are a curious race — More whirled by passions , hot in chase Of passions , than myself am whirled When tempests tug me o'er the world ; I cannot understand your ways . We clouds live our divinest days Beneath great sunny depths of sky , High above all that you think high , Drifting through sunset 's surf of gold , Dawn-lakes and moonlight 's clear waves cold , In realms so distant , chill and lone , That Love , impatient , leaves the throne To meditative Amity .</p>
   <p>RANDOLPH So would my guardian have it be , So flowed his constant voice to me , Of those to make me one , he sought , Who watch from mountain towers of thought , Or wandering into paths apart Pursue the lonely star of art .</p>
   <p>WIND But you would rather love and do . Well said , so much the wiser you ! But let your love be false as maid 's , Your every fire a flame that fades — A word , a smile , an easy thing To fledge and easy taking wing . Kiss every lip , as tired of rest As I am now . I 'm off to west Good-bye , and some day when you 're hot I 'll meet you cool .</p>
   <p>CLOUD And I should not Delay my showers so long as this . God speed ! Good-bye !</p>
   <p>RANDOLPH Good-bye . I miss Their wonderful companionship . So onward seems the world to slip . Now one glance backward firmly cast ; Thy next foot forward bears thee past The mountain 's crest . Ah , I behold Our reckless river leaping bold Down all its ledges . And I see The castle where Elaine must be . Lo , in yon window sits she oft .— From yon green maze of willows soft I hear our hermitage 's bell . Sweet sound , sweet many scenes , farewell . Elaine ! Elaine !</p>

    <head>WINTER 'S DAWN IN LOWER CANADA .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">To each there lives some beauteous sight : mine is to me most fair ,</l>
     <l n="2">I carry fadeless one clear dawn in keen December air ,</l>
     <l n="3">O'er leagues of plain from night we fled upon a pulsing train ;</l>
     <l n="4">For breath of morn , outside I stood . Then up a carmine stain</l>
     <l n="5">Flushed calm and rich the long , low east , deep reddening till the sun</l>
     <l n="6">Eyed from its molten fires and shot strange arrows , one by one</l>
     <l n="7">On certain fields , and on a wood of distant evergreen ,</l>
     <l n="8">And fairy opal blues and pinks on all the snows between :</l>
     <l n="9">( Broad earth had never such a flower , as in my country grows ,</l>
     <l n="10">When at the rising winter sun , the plain is all a rose . )</l>
     <l n="11">Then seemed all nymphs and gods awake — heaven brightened with their</l>
     <l n="12">smiles ,</l>
     <l n="13">The land was theirs ; like mirages , stood out Elysian isles .</l>
     <l n="14">Westward the forests smiled in strength and glory like the plain ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their bare boughs rose , an arrowy flight , and by them sped the train .</l>
     <l n="16">But dream-crown of that porcelain sea , those plains of sunrise snow ,</l>
     <l n="17">The green woods east , the grey woods west , and molten carmine glow —</l>
     <l n="18">A light flashed through the sappling wastes and alders nearer by ,</l>
     <l n="19">Where Phoebus worked the spell of spells that ever charmed an eye ,</l>
     <l n="20">His bright spears to the forest-flakes reached ; that on their branches</l>
     <l n="21">lay ,</l>
     <l n="22">And each shot back , as we sped by , a single peerless ray .</l>
     <l n="23">More bright than starry hosts appeared that vision in the wood</l>
     <l n="24">And flashed and flew like fire-flies in a nightly solitude ,</l>
     <l n="25">A maze of silver stars , a dance of diamonds in the day :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="26">Through many lives though fly my soul as on that pulsing train ,</l>
     <l n="27">That sparkling dawn shall oftentimes enkindle it again .</l>
