    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The high and mighty lord of Glendare ,</l>
     <l n="2">The owner of acres both broad and fair ,</l>
     <l n="3">Searched , once on a time , his vast domains ,</l>
     <l n="4">His deep , green forest , and yellow plains ,</l>
     <l n="5">For some rare singer , to make complete</l>
     <l n="6">The studied charms of his country-seat ;</l>

     <l n="9">Ah , what shall my lord of the manor do ?</l>
     <l n="10">He pondered the day and the whole night through .</l>

     <l n="12">And at last on Madame the Nightingale ,—</l>
     <l n="13">Inviting , in his majestical way ,</l>
     <l n="14">Her pupils to sing at his grand soiree ,</l>
     <l n="15">That perchance among them my lord might find</l>
     <l n="16">Some singer to whom his heart inclined .</l>
     <l n="17">What wonder , then , when the evening came ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the castle gardens were all aflame</l>
     <l n="19">With the many curious lights that hung</l>
     <l n="20">O'er the ivied porches , and flared among</l>
     <l n="21">The grand old trees and the banners proud ,</l>
     <l n="22">That many a heart beat high and loud ,</l>
     <l n="23">While the famous choir of Glendare Bog ,</l>
     <l n="24">Established and led by the Brothers Frog ,</l>
     <l n="25">Sat thrumming as hoarsely as they were able ,</l>
     <l n="26">In front of the manager 's mushroom table !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">The overture closed with a crash — then , hark !</l>
     <l n="28">Across the stage comes the sweet-voiced Lark .</l>
     <l n="29">She daintily sways , with an airy grace ,</l>
     <l n="30">And flutters a bit of gossamer lace ,</l>
     <l n="31">While the leafy alcove echoes and thrills</l>
     <l n="32">With her liquid runs and lingering trills .</l>
     <l n="33">Miss Goldfinch came next , in her satin gown ,</l>
     <l n="34">And shaking her feathery flounces down ,</l>
     <l n="35">With much expression and feeling sung</l>
     <l n="36">Some “ Oh 's ” and “ Ah 's ” in a foreign tongue ;</l>
     <l n="37">While to give the affair a classic tone ,</l>
     <l n="38">Miss Katydid rendered a song of her own ,</l>
     <l n="39">In which each line closed as it had begun ,</l>
     <l n="40">With some wonderful deed which she had done .</l>
     <l n="41">Then the Misses Sparrow , so prim and set ,</l>
     <l n="42">Twittered and chirped through a long duet ;</l>
     <l n="43">And poor little Wren , who tried with a will ,</l>
     <l n="44">But who could n't tell “ Heber ” from “ Ortonville , ”</l>
     <l n="45">Unconscious of sarcasm , piped away</l>
     <l n="46">And courtesied low o'er a huge bouquet</l>
     <l n="47">Of crimson clover-heads , culled by the dozen ,</l>
     <l n="48">By some brown-coated , plebeian cousin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">But you should have heard the red Robin sing</l>
     <l n="50">His English ballad , “ Come , beautiful Spring ! ”</l>

     <l n="52">“ O , meet me under the silvery moon ! ”</l>
     <l n="53">Then , as flighty Miss Humming-bird did n't care</l>
     <l n="54">To sing for the high and mighty Glendare ,</l>
     <l n="55">The close of the evening 's performance fell</l>
     <l n="56">To the fair young Nightingale , Mademoiselle .</l>
     <l n="57">Ah ! the wealth of each wonderful note</l>
     <l n="58">That came from the depths of her tiny throat !</l>
     <l n="59">She carolled , she trilled , and she held her breath ,</l>
     <l n="60">Till she seemed to hang at the point of death :</l>
     <l n="61">She ran the chromatics through every key ,</l>
     <l n="62">And ended triumphant on upper C ;</l>
     <l n="63">Airing the graces her mother had taught her</l>
     <l n="64">In a manner quite worthy of Madame 's daughter .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="65">But his lordship glared down the leafy aisle</l>
     <l n="66">With never so much as a nod or smile ,</l>
     <l n="67">Till , out in the shade of a blackberry thicket ,</l>
     <l n="68">He all of a sudden spied little Miss Cricket ;</l>
     <l n="69">And , roused from his gloom , like an angry bat ,</l>
     <l n="70">He sternly demanded , “ Who is that ? ”</l>
     <l n="71">“ Miss Cricket , my lord , may it please you so ,</l>
     <l n="72">A charity scholar — ahem !— you know —</l>
     <l n="73">Quite worthy , of course , but we could n't bring ” —</l>
     <l n="74">Thundered His Mightiness , “ Let her sing ! ”</l>
     <l n="75">The Nightingale opened her little eyes</l>
     <l n="76">Extremely wide in her blank surprise ;</l>
     <l n="77">But catching a glimpse of his lordship 's rage ,</l>
     <l n="78">Led little Miss Cricket upon the stage ,</l>
     <l n="79">Where she modestly sang , in her simple measures ,</l>
     <l n="80">Of “ Home , sweet Home , ” and its humble pleasures .</l>
     <l n="81">And the lord of Glendare cried out in his glee ,</l>
     <l n="82">“ This little Miss Cricket shall sing for me ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="83">Of course , of comment there was no need ;</l>
     <l n="84">But the world said , “ Really ! ” and “ Ah , indeed ! ”</l>
     <l n="85">Yet , notwithstanding , we find it true</l>
     <l n="86">As his lordship does will the neighbors do ;</l>
     <l n="87">So this is the way , as the legends tell ,</l>
     <l n="88">In the very beginning it befell</l>
     <l n="89">That the Crickets came , in the evening 's gloom ,</l>

     <l n="29">Then he came out to his door again , and merrily did sing ,—</l>

     <l n="4">Nor yet when eventide was ended ,</l>

     <l n="9">A something shining in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="10">And knew the glow-worm by his spark ;</l>
     <l n="11">So , stooping down from hawthorn top ,</l>
     <l n="12">He thought to put him in his crop .</l>
     <l n="13">The worm , aware of his intent ,</l>
     <l n="14">Harangued him thus , right eloquent :</l>

     <l n="16">“ As much as I your minstrelsy ,</l>
     <l n="17">You would abhor to do me wrong ,</l>

     <l n="31">But sing and shine by sweet consent ,</l>
     <l n="32">Till life 's poor transient night is spent ,</l>

     <l n="3">A doleful story you shall hear ,</l>
     <l n="4">In time brought forth to light .</l>
     <l n="5">A gentleman of good account</l>
     <l n="6">In Norfolk dwelt of late ,</l>

     <l n="78">THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN</l>
     <l n="79">A Child 's Story</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I Hamelin Town 's in Brunswick , By famous Hanover city ; The river Weser , deep and wide , Washes its wall on the southern side ; A pleasanter spot you never spied ; But , when begins my ditty , Almost five hundred years ago , To see the townsfolk suffer so From vermin was a pity .</p>
   <p>II Rats ! They fought the dogs and killed the cats , And bit the babies in the cradles , And ate the cheeses out of the vats , And licked the soup from the cooks ’ own ladles , Split open the kegs of salted sprats , Made nests inside men 's Sunday hats , And even spoiled the women 's chats By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats .</p>
   <p>III At last the people in a body To the Town Hall came flocking : “ ‘ Tis clear , ” cried they , “ our Mayor 's a noddy ; And as for our Corporation ,— shocking To think we buy gowns lined with ermine For dolts that can n't or wo n't determine What 's best to rid us of our vermin ! You hope , because you 're old and obese , To find in the furry civic robe ease ? Rouse up , sirs ! Give your brains a racking , To find the remedy we 're lacking , Or , sure as fate , we 'll send you packing ! ” At this the Mayor and Corporation Quaked with a mighty consternation .</p>
   <p>IV An hour they sat in council ,— At length the Mayor broke silence : “ For a guilder I 'd my ermine gown sell ; I wish I were a mile hence ! It 's easy to bid one rack one 's brain ,— I 'm sure my poor head aches again , I 've scratched it so , and all in vain . Oh for a trap , a trap , a trap ! ” Just as he said this , what should hap At the chamber-door but a gentle tap ? “ Bless us , ” cried the Mayor , “ what 's that ? ” ( With the Corporation as he sat , Looking little though wondrous fat ; Nor brighter was his eye , nor moister Than a too-long-opened oyster , Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous For a plate of turtle green and glutinous ) “ Only a scraping of shoes on the mat ? Anything like the sound of a rat Makes my heart go pit-a-pat ! ”</p>
   <p>V “ Come in ! ” the Mayor cried , looking bigger : And in did come the strangest figure ! His queer long coat from heel to head Was half of yellow and half of red , And he himself was tall and thin , With sharp blue eyes , each like a pin , And light loose hair , yet swarthy skin , No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin , But lips where smiles went out and in ; There was no guessing his kith and kin : And nobody could enough admire The tall man and his quaint attire . Quoth one : “ It 's as my great-grandsire , Starting up at the Trump of Doom 's tone , Had walked this way from his painted tombstone ! ”</p>
   <p>VI He advanced to the council-table : And , “ Please your honors , ” said he , I 'm able , By means of a secret charm , to draw All creatures living beneath the sun , That creep or swim or fly or run , After me so as you never saw ! And I chiefly use my charm On creatures that do people harm , The mole and toad and newt and viper ; And people call me the Pied Piper . ” ( And here they noticed round his neck A scarf of red and yellow stripe , To match with his coat of the self-same check , And at the scarf 's end hung a pipe ; And his fingers , they noticed , were ever straying As if impatient to be playing Upon this pipe , as low it dangled Over his vesture so old-fangled . ) “ Yet , ” said he , “ poor piper as I am , In Tartary I freed the Cham , Last June , from his huge swarms of gnats ; I eased in Asia the Nizam Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats ; And as for what your brain bewilders ,— If I can rid your town of rats , Will you give me a thousand guilders ? ” “ One ? fifty thousand ! ” was the exclamation Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation .</p>
   <p>VII Into the street the Piper stepped , Smiling first a little smile , As if he knew what magic slept In his quiet pipe the while ; Then , like a musical adept , To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled , And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled , Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled ; And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered , You heard as if an army muttered ; And the muttering grew to a grumbling ; And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ; And out of the houses the rats came tumbling . Great rats , small rats , lean rats , brawny rats , Brown rats , black rats , gray rats , tawny rats , Grave old plodders , gay young friskers , Fathers , mothers , uncles , cousins , Cocking tails and pricking whiskers ; Families by tens and dozens , Brothers , sisters , husbands , wives ,— Followed the Piper for their lives . From street to street he piped advancing , And step for step they followed dancing , Until they came to the river Weser , Wherein all plunged and perished ! — Save one who , stout as Julius Caesar , Swam across and lived to carry ( As he , the manuscript he cherished ) To Rat-land home his commentary , Which was : “ At the first shrill notes of the pipe , I heard a sound as of scraping tripe , And putting apples , wondrous ripe , Into a cider-press 's gripe ,— And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards , And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards , And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks , And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks ; And it seemed as if a voice ( Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery Is breathed ) called out , ‘ Oh rats , rejoice ! The world is grown to one vast drysaltery ! So munch on , crunch on , take your nuncheon , Breakfast , supper , dinner , luncheon ! ’ And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon , Already staved , like a great sun shone Glorious scarce an inch before me , Just as methought it said , ‘ Come , bore me ! ’ — I found the Weser rolling o'er me . ”</p>
   <p>VIII You should have heard the Hamelin people Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple ; “ Go , ” cried the Mayor , “ and get long poles ! Poke out the nests and block up the holes ! Consult with carpenters and builders , And leave in our town not even a trace Of the rats ! ” — when suddenly , up the face Of the Piper perked in the market-place , With a “ First , if you please , my thousand guilders ! ”</p>
   <p>IX A thousand guilders ! the Mayor looked blue ; So did the Corporation too . For council-dinners made rare havoc With Claret , Moselle , Via-de-Grave , Hock ; And half the money would replenish Their cellar 's biggest butt with Rhenish . To pay this sum to a wandering fellow With a gypsy coat of red and yellow ! “ Beside , ” quoth the Mayor , with a knowing wink , “ Our business was done at the river 's brink ; We saw with our eyes the vermin sink , And what 's dead can n't come to life , I think . So , friend , we 're not the folks to shrink From the duty of giving you something to drink , And a matter of money to put in your poke ; But as for the guilders , what we spoke Of them , as you very well know , was in joke . Beside , our losses have made us thrifty ; A thousand guilders ! Come , take fifty ! ”</p>
   <p>X The Piper 's face fell , and he cried , “ No trifling ! I can n't wait ! beside , I 've promised to visit by dinner time Bagdat , and accept the prime Of the Head Cook 's pottage , all he 's rich in , For having left , in the Caliph 's kitchen , Of a nest of scorpions no survivor : With him I proved no bargain-driver ; With you , do n't think I 'll bate a stiver ! And folks who put me in a passion May find me pipe after another fashion . ”</p>
   <p>XI “ How ? ” cried the Mayor , “ d'ye think I brook Being worse treated than a Cook ? Insulted by a lazy ribald With idle pipe and vesture piebald ? You threaten us , fellow ? Do your worst , Blow your pipe there till you burst ! ”</p>
   <p>XII Once more he stepped into the street ; And to his lips again Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane ; And ere he blew three notes ( such sweet Soft notes as yet musician 's cunning Never gave the enraptured air ) There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling ; Small feet were pattering , wooden shoes clattering , Little hands clapping , and little tongues chattering ; And , like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering , Out came the children running : All the little boys and girls , With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls , And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls , Tripping and skipping , ran merrily after The wonderful music with shouting and laughter .</p>
   <p>XIII The Mayor was dumb , and the Council stood As if they were changed into blocks of wood , Unable to move a step , or cry To the children merrily skipping by ,— And could only follow with the eye That joyous crowd at the Piper 's back . But how the Mayor was on the rack , And the wretched Council 's bosoms beat , As the Piper turned from the High Street To where the Weser rolled its waters Right in the way of their sons and daughters ! However , he turned from south to west , And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed , And after him the children pressed ; Great was the joy in every breast . “ He never can cross that mighty top ! He 's forced to let the piping drop , And we shall see our children stop ! ” When , lo , as they reached the mountain-side , A wondrous portal opened wide , As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed ; And the Piper advanced and the children followed ; And when all were in , to the very last , The door in the mountain-side shut fast . Did I say , all ? No ! One was lame , And could not dance the whole of the way ; And in after years , if you would blame His sadness , he was used to say ,— “ It 's dull in our town since my playmates left ! I can n't forget that I 'm bereft Of all the pleasant sights they see , Which the Piper also promised me ; For he led us , he said , to a joyous land , Joining the town and just at hand , Where waters gushed , and fruit-trees grew , And flowers put forth a fairer hue , And everything was strange and new ; The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here , And their dogs outran our fallow deer , And honey-bees had lost their stings , And horses were born with eagles ’ wings ; And just as I became assured My lame foot would be speedily cured , The music stopped and I stood still , And found myself outside the hill , Left alone against my will , To go now limping as before , And never hear of that country more !</p>
   <p>XIV Alas , alas for Hamelin ! There came into many a burgher 's pate A text which says that heaven 's gate Opes to the rich at as easy rate As the needle 's eye takes a camel in ! The Mayor sent East , West , North and South , To offer the Piper , by word of mouth , Wherever it was men 's lot to find him , Silver and gold to his heart 's content , If he 'd only return the way he went , And bring the children behind him . But when they saw ‘ twas a lost endeavor , And piper and dancers were gone forever , They made a decree that lawyers never Should think their records dated duly If , after the day of the month and year , These words did not as well appear , “ And so long after what happened here On the Twenty-second of July , Thirteen hundred and seventy-six : ” And the better in memory to fix The place of the children 's last retreat , They called it , the Pied Piper 's Street — Where any one playing on pipe or tabor Was sure for the future to lose his labor . Nor suffered they hostlery or tavern To shock with mirth a street so solemn ; But opposite the place of the cavern They wrote the story on a column , And on the great church-window painted The same , to make the world acquainted How their children were stolen away , And there it stands to this very day . And I must not omit to say That in Transylvania there 's a tribe Of alien people who ascribe The outlandish ways and dress On which their neighbors lay such stress , To their fathers and mothers having risen Out of some subterraneous prison Into which they were trepanned Long time ago in a mighty band Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land , But how or why , they do n't understand .</p>
   <p>XV So , Willy , let me and you be wipers Of scores out with all men — especially pipers ! And , whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice , If we 've promised them aught , let us keep our promise !</p>

    <head>THE THREE KINGS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Three Kings came riding from far away ,</l>
     <l n="2">Melchior and Gaspar and Baltasar ;</l>
     <l n="3">Three Wise Men out of the East were they ,</l>
     <l n="4">And they travelled by night and they slept by day ,</l>
     <l n="5">For their guide was a beautiful , wonderful star .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">The star was so beautiful , large and clear ,</l>
     <l n="7">That all the other stars of the sky</l>
     <l n="8">Became a white mist in the atmosphere ;</l>
     <l n="9">And by this they knew that the coming was near</l>
     <l n="10">Of the Prince foretold in the prophecy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Three caskets they bore on their saddle-bows ,</l>
     <l n="12">Three caskets of gold with golden keys ;</l>
     <l n="13">Their robes were of crimson silk , with rows</l>
     <l n="14">Of bells and pomegranates and furbelows ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their turbans like blossoming almond-trees .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">And so the Three Kings rode into the West ,</l>
     <l n="17">Through the dusk of night , over hill and dell ,</l>
     <l n="18">And sometimes they nodded with beard on breast ,</l>
     <l n="19">And sometimes talked , as they paused to rest ,</l>
     <l n="20">With the people they met at some wayside well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">“ Of the child that is born , ” said Baltasar ,</l>
     <l n="22">“ Good people , I pray you , tell us the news ,</l>
     <l n="23">For we in the East have seen his star ,</l>
     <l n="24">And have ridden fast , and have ridden far ,</l>
     <l n="25">To find and worship the King of the Jews . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">And the people answered , “ You ask in vain ;</l>
     <l n="27">We know of no king but Herod the Great ! ”</l>
     <l n="28">They thought the Wise Men were men insane ,</l>
     <l n="29">As they spurred their horses across the plain</l>
     <l n="30">Like riders in haste , and who cannot wait .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="31">And when they came to Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="32">Herod the Great , who had heard this thing ,</l>
     <l n="33">Sent for the Wise Men and questioned them ;</l>
     <l n="34">And said , “ Go down unto Bethlehem ,</l>
     <l n="35">And bring me tidings of this new king . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="36">So they rode away , and the star stood still ,</l>
     <l n="37">The only one in the gray of morn ;</l>
     <l n="38">Yes , it stopped ,— it stood still of its own free will ,</l>
     <l n="39">Right over Bethlehem on the hill ,</l>
     <l n="40">The city of David , where Christ was born .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="41">And the Three Kings rode through the gate and the guard ,</l>
     <l n="42">Through the silent street , till their horses turned</l>
     <l n="43">And neighed as they entered the great inn-yard ;</l>
     <l n="44">But the windows were closed , and the doors were barred ,</l>
     <l n="45">And only a light in the stable burned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="46">And cradled there in the scented hay ,</l>
     <l n="47">In the air made sweet by the breath of kine ,</l>
     <l n="48">The little child in the manger lay ,</l>
     <l n="49">The Child that would be King one day</l>
     <l n="50">Of a kingdom not human , but divine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="51">His mother , Mary of Nazareth ,</l>
     <l n="52">Sat watching beside his place of rest ,</l>
     <l n="53">Watching the even flow of his breath ,</l>
     <l n="54">For the joy of life and the terror of death</l>
     <l n="55">Were mingled together in her breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="56">They laid their offerings at his feet :</l>
     <l n="57">The gold was their tribute to a King ;</l>
     <l n="58">The frankincense , with its odor sweet ,</l>
     <l n="59">Was for the Priest , the Paraclete ;</l>
     <l n="60">The myrrh for the body 's burying .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="61">And the mother wondered and bowed her head ,</l>
     <l n="62">And sat as still as a statue of stone ;</l>
     <l n="63">Her heart was troubled yet comforted ,</l>
     <l n="64">Remembering what the Angel had said</l>
     <l n="65">Of an endless reign and of David 's throne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="66">Then the Kings rode out of the city gate ,</l>
     <l n="67">With a clatter of hoofs in proud array ;</l>
     <l n="68">But they went not back to Herod the Great ,</l>
     <l n="69">For they knew his malice and feared his hate ,</l>
     <l n="70">And returned to their homes by another way .</l>

    <head>A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Twas the night before Christmas , when all through the house</l>
     <l n="2">Not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse ;</l>
     <l n="3">The stockings were hung by the chimney with care ,</l>
     <l n="4">In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there ;</l>
     <l n="5">The children were nestled all snug in their beds ,</l>
     <l n="6">While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads ;</l>
     <l n="7">And mamma in her ‘ kerchief , and I in my cap ,</l>
     <l n="8">Had just settled our brains for a long winter 's nap ,</l>
     <l n="9">When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter ,</l>
     <l n="10">I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter .</l>
     <l n="11">Away to the window I flew like a flash ,</l>
     <l n="12">Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash .</l>
     <l n="13">The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow</l>
     <l n="14">Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below ,</l>
     <l n="15">When , what to my wondering eyes should appear ,</l>
     <l n="16">But a miniature sleigh , and eight tiny reindeer ,</l>
     <l n="17">With a little old driver , so lively and quick ,</l>
     <l n="18">I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick .</l>
     <l n="19">More rapid than eagles his coursers they came ,</l>
     <l n="20">And he whistled , and shouted , and called them by name ;</l>
     <l n="21">“ Now , Dasher ! now , Dancer ! now , Prancer and Vixen !</l>
     <l n="22">On , Comet ! on Cupid ! on , Donder and Blitzen !</l>
     <l n="23">To the top of the porch ! to the top of the wall !</l>
     <l n="24">Now dash away ! dash away ! dash away all ! ”</l>
     <l n="25">As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly ,</l>
     <l n="26">When they meet with an obstacle , mount to the sky ,</l>
     <l n="27">So up to the house-top the coursers they flew ,</l>
     <l n="28">With the sleigh full of toys , and St. Nicholas too .</l>
     <l n="29">And then , in a twinkling , I heard on the roof</l>
     <l n="30">The prancing and pawing of each little hoof .</l>
     <l n="31">As I drew in my head , and was turning around ,</l>
     <l n="32">Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound .</l>
     <l n="33">He was dressed all in fur , from his head to his foot ,</l>
     <l n="34">And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot ;</l>
     <l n="35">A bundle of toys he had flung on his back ,</l>
     <l n="36">And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack .</l>
     <l n="37">His eyes — how they twinkled ! his dimples how merry !</l>
     <l n="38">His cheeks were like roses , his nose like a cherry !</l>
     <l n="39">His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow ;</l>
     <l n="41">The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth ,</l>
     <l n="42">And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath ;</l>
     <l n="43">He had a broad face and a little round belly ,</l>
     <l n="44">That shook , when he laughed , like a bowlful of jelly .</l>
     <l n="45">He was chubby and plump , a right jolly old elf ,</l>
     <l n="46">And I laughed when I saw him , in spite of myself ;</l>
     <l n="47">A wink of his eye and a twist of his head ,</l>
     <l n="48">Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread ;</l>
     <l n="49">He spoke not a word , but went straight to his work ,</l>
     <l n="50">And filled all the stockings ; then turned with a jerk ,</l>
     <l n="51">And laying his finger aside of his nose ,</l>
     <l n="52">And giving a nod , up the chimney he rose ;</l>
     <l n="53">He sprang to his sleigh , to his team gave a whistle ,</l>
     <l n="54">And away they all flew like the down of a thistle .</l>
     <l n="55">But I heard him exclaim , ere he drove out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="56">“ Happy Christmas to all , and to all a good-night . ”</l>

     <l n="129">How should He know that it 's me ? such a lot of beds in the ward ? ”</l>
     <l n="130">That was a puzzle for Annie . Again she considered and said :</l>
     <l n="131">“ Emmie , you put out your arms , and you leave ‘ em outside on the bed —</l>

     <l n="134">I had sat three nights by the child — I could not watch her for four —</l>

     <l n="137">There was a thunderclap once , and a clatter of hail on the glass ,</l>

     <l n="139">The motherless bleat of a lamb in the storm and the darkness without ;</l>
     <l n="140">My sleep was broken besides with dreams of the dreadful knife</l>
     <l n="141">And fears for our delicate Emmie who scarce would escape with her life ;</l>
     <l n="142">Then in the gray of the morning it seemed she stood by me and smiled ,</l>

     <l n="46">On the scroll of twice three thousand years ,</l>
     <l n="47">More than in the groves is taught ,</l>
     <l n="48">Or from furthest Indies brought ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My little Madchen found one day</l>
     <l n="2">A curious something in her play ,</l>
     <l n="3">That was not fruit , nor flower , nor seed ;</l>

     <l n="5">Or crept , or climbed , or swam , or flew ;</l>
     <l n="6">Had neither legs nor wings , indeed ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">She brought in her tiny hand</l>
     <l n="10">To see if I would understand ,</l>
     <l n="11">And wondered when I made reply ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ You 've found a baby butterfly . ”</l>
     <l n="13">“ A butterfly is not like this , ”</l>
     <l n="14">With doubtful look she answered me .</l>
     <l n="15">So then I told her what would be</l>
     <l n="16">Some day within the chrysalis ;</l>
     <l n="17">How , slowly , in the dull brown thing</l>
     <l n="18">Now still as death , a spotted wing ,</l>
     <l n="19">And then another , would unfold ,</l>
     <l n="20">Till from the empty shell would fly</l>
     <l n="21">A pretty creature , by and by ,</l>
     <l n="22">All radiant in blue and gold .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">“ And will it , truly ? ” questioned she —</l>

     <l n="26">“ And shall your little Madchen see ? ”</l>
     <l n="27">“ She shall ! I said . How could I tell</l>
     <l n="28">That ere the worm within its shell</l>
     <l n="29">Its gauzy , splendid wings had spread ,</l>
     <l n="30">My little Madchen would be dead ?</l>

     <l n="31">To-day the butterfly has flown ,—</l>
     <l n="32">She was not here to see it fly ,—</l>

     <l n="34">The empty shell is mine alone .</l>
     <l n="35">Perhaps the secret lies in this :</l>
     <l n="36">I too had found a chrysalis ,</l>
     <l n="37">And Death that robbed me of delight</l>
     <l n="38">Was but the radiant creature 's flight !</l>

     <l n="52">From “ Mimma Bella ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I Have dark Egyptians stolen Thee away , Oh Baby , Baby , in whose cot we peer As down some empty gulf that opens sheer And fathomless , illumined by no ray ? And wilt thou come , on some far distant day , With unknown face , and say , “ Behold ! I 'm here , The child you lost ; ” while we in sudden fear , Dumb with great doubt , shall find no word to say ? One darker than dark gipsy holds thee fast ; One whose strong fingers none has forced apart Since first they closed on things that were too fair ; Nor shall we see thee other than thou wast , But such as thou art printed in the heart , In changeless baby loveliness still there .</p>
   <p>II Two springs she saw — two radiant Tuscan springs , What time the wild red tulips are aflame In the new wheat , and wreaths of young vine frame The daffodils that every light breeze swings ; And the anemones that April brings Make purple pools , as if Adonis came Just there to die ; and Florence scrolls her name In every blossom Primavera flings . Now , when the scented iris , straight and tall , Shall hedge the garden gravel once again With pale blue flags , at May 's exulting call , And when the amber roses , wet with rain , Shall tapestry the old gray villa wall , We , left alone , shall seek one bud in vain .</p>
   <p>IV Oh , rosy as the lining of a shell Were the wee hands that now are white as snows ; And like pink coral , with their elfin toes , The feet that on life 's brambles never fell . And with its tiny smile , adorable The mouth that never knew life 's bitter sloes ; And like the incurved petal of a rose The little ear , now deaf in Death 's strong spell . Now , while the seasons in their order roll , And sun and rain pour down from God 's great dome , And deathless stars shine nightly overhead , Near other children , with her little doll , She waits the wizard that will never come To wake the sleep-struck playground of the dead .</p>
   <p>VI Oh , bless the law that veils the Future 's face ; For who could smile into a baby 's eyes , Or bear the beauty of the evening skies , If he could see what cometh on apace ? The ticking of the death-watch would replace The baby 's prattle , for the over-wise ; The breeze 's murmur would become the cries Of stormy petrels where the breakers race . We live as moves the walker in his sleep , Who walks because he sees not the abyss His feet are skirting as he goes his way : If we could see the morrow from the steep Of our security , the soul would miss Its footing , and fall headlong from to-day .</p>
   <p>VIII One day , I mind me , now that she is dead , When nothing warned us of the dark decree , I crooned , to lull her , in a minor key , Such fancies as first came into my head . I crooned them low , beside her little bed ; And the refrain was somehow “ Come with me , And we will wander by the purple sea ; ” I crooned it , and — God help me !— felt no dread . O Purple Sea , beyond the stress of storms , Where never ripple breaks upon the shore Of Death 's pale Isles of Twilight as they dream , Give back , give back , O Sea of Nevermore , The frailest of the unsubstantial forms That leave the shores that are for those that seem !</p>
   <p>XX What essences from Idumean palm , What ambergris , what sacerdotal wine , What Arab myrrh , what spikenard , would be thine , If I could swathe thy memory in such balm ! Oh , for wrecked gold , from depths for ever calm , To fashion for thy name a fretted shrine ; Oh , for strange gems , still locked in virgin mine , To stud the pyx , where thought would bring sweet psalm ! I have but this small rosary of rhyme ,— No rubies but heart 's drops , no pearls but tears , To lay upon the altar of thy name , O Mimma Bella ;— on the shrine that Time Makes ever holier for the soul , while years Obliterate the rolls of human fame .</p>

   <p>THE THREE COTTAGE GIRLS</p>
   <p>I How blest the Maid whose heart — yet free From Love 's uneasy sovereignty — Beats with a fancy running high , Her simple cares to magnify ; Whom Labor , never urged to toil , Hath cherished on a healthful soil ; Who knows not pomp , who heeds not pelf ; Whose heaviest sin it is to look Askance upon her pretty Self Reflected in some crystal brook ; Whom grief hath spared — who sheds no tear But in sweet pity ; and can hear Another 's praise from envy clear .</p>
   <p>II Such ( but O lavish Nature ! why That dark unfathomable eye , Where lurks a Spirit that replies To stillest mood of softest skies , Yet hints at peace to be o'erthrown , Another 's first , and then her own ? ) Such haply , yon Italian Maid , Our Lady 's laggard Votaress , Halting beneath the chestnut shade To accomplish there her loveliness : Nice aid maternal fingers lend ; A Sister serves with slacker hand ; Then , glittering like a star , she joins the festal band .</p>
   <p>III How blest ( if truth may entertain Coy fancy with a bolder strain ) The Helvetian Girl — who daily braves , In her light skiff , the tossing waves , And quits the bosom of the deep Only to climb the rugged steep ! — Say whence that modulated shout ! From Wood-nymph of Diana 's throng ? Or does the greeting to a rout Of giddy Bacchanals belong ? Jubilant outcry ! rock and glade Resounded — but the voice obeyed The breath of an Helvetian Maid .</p>
   <p>IV Her beauty dazzles the thick wood ; Her courage animates the flood ; Her steps the elastic greensward meets Returning unreluctant sweets ; The mountains ( as ye heard ) rejoice Aloud , saluted by her voice ! Blithe Paragon of Alpine grace , Be as thou art — for through thy veins The blood of Heroes runs its race ! And nobly wilt thou brook the chains That , for the virtuous , Life prepares ; The fetter which the Matron wears ; The patriot Mother 's weight of anxious cares !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Sweet Highland Girl ! a very shower</l>
     <l n="2">Of beauty was thy earthly dower , ”</l>
     <l n="3">When thou didst flit before mine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="4">Gay Vision under sullen skies ,</l>
     <l n="5">While Hope and Love around thee played ,</l>
     <l n="6">Near the rough falls of Inversneyd !</l>
     <l n="7">Have they , who nursed the blossom , seen</l>
     <l n="8">No breach of promise in the fruit ?</l>
     <l n="9">Was joy , in following joy , as keen</l>
     <l n="10">As grief can be in grief 's pursuit ?</l>
     <l n="11">When youth had flown did hope still bless</l>
     <l n="12">Thy goings — or the cheerfulness</l>
     <l n="13">Of innocence survive to mitigate distress ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>VI But from our course why turn — to tread A way with shadows overspread ; Where what we gladliest would believe Is feared as what may most deceive ? Bright Spirit , not with amaranth crowned But heath-bells from thy native ground , Time cannot thin thy flowing hair , Nor take one ray of light from Thee ; For in my Fancy thou dost share The gift of immortality ; And there shall bloom , with Thee allied , The Votaress by Lugano 's side ; And that intrepid Nymph , on Uri 's steep descried !</p>

     <l n="22">ODE ON THE INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY</l>
     <l n="23">FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I There was a time when meadow , grove , and stream , The earth , and every common sight , To me did seem Apparelled in celestial light , The glory and the freshness of a dream . It is not now as it hath been of yore ;— Turn wheresoe'er I may , By night or day , The things which I have seen I now can see no more .</p>
   <p>II The Rainbow comes and goes , And lovely is the Rose ; The Moon doth with delight Look round her when the heavens are bare ; Waters on a starry night Are beautiful and fair ; The sunshine is a glorious birth ; But yet I know , where'er I go , That there hath passed away a glory from the earth .</p>
   <p>III Now , while the Birds thus sing a joyous song , And while the young Lambs bound As to the tabor 's sound , To me alone there came a thought of grief : A timely utterance gave that thought relief , And I again am strong . The Cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep : No more shall grief of mine the season wrong ; I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng , The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep , And all the earth is gay ; Land and Sea Give themselves up to jollity , And with the heart of May Doth every Beast keep holiday ;— Thou Child of Joy , Shout round me , let me hear thy shouts , thou happy Shepherd-boy !</p>
   <p>IV Ye blessed Creatures , I have heard the call Ye to each other make ; I see The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee ; My heart is at your festival , My head hath its coronal , The fulness of your bliss , I feel — I feel it all . O evil day ! if I were sullen While Earth herself is adorning This sweet May morning , And the Children are culling On every side , In a thousand valleys far and wide , Fresh flowers ; while the sun shines warm , And the Babe leaps up on his Mother 's arm :— I hear , I hear , with joy I hear ! — But there 's a Tree , of many , one , A single Field which I have looked upon , Both of them speak of something that is gone : The Pansy at my feet Doth the same tale repeat : Whither is fled the visionary gleam ? Where is it now , the glory and the dream ?</p>
   <p>V Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting : The Soul that rises with us , our life 's Star , Hath had elsewhere its setting , And cometh from afar : Not in entire forgetfulness , And not in utter nakedness , But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God , who is our home : Heaven lies about us in our infancy ! Shades of the prison-house begin to close Upon the growing Boy , But he beholds the light , and whence it flows , He sees it in his joy ; The Youth , who daily farther from the East Must travel , still is Nature 's Priest , And by the vision spendid Is on his way attended ; At length the Man perceives it die away , And fade into the light of common day .</p>
   <p>VI Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own ; Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind , And even with something of a Mother 's mind , And no unworthy aim , The homely Nurse doth all she can , To make her Foster-child , her Inmate Man , Forget the glories he hath known , And that imperial palace whence he came .</p>
   <p>VII Behold the Child among his new-born blisses , A six years ’ darling of a pigmy size ! See , where ‘ mid work of his own hand he lies , Fretted by sallies of his Mother 's kisses , With light upon him from his Father 's eyes ! See , at his feet , some little plan or chart , Some fragment from his dream of human life , Shaped by himself with newly-learned art ; A wedding or a festival , A mourning or a funeral ; And this hath now his heart , And unto this he frames his song : Then will he fit his tongue To dialogues of business , love , or strife : But it will not be long Ere this be thrown aside , And with new joy and pride The little Actor cons another part ; Filling from time to time his “ humorous stage ” With all the Persons , down to palsied Age , That Life brings with her in her equipage ; As if his whole vocation Were endless imitation .</p>
   <p>VIII Thou , whose exterior semblance doth belie Thy Soul 's immensity ; Thou best Philosopher , who yet dost keep Thy heritage , thou Eye among the blind , That , deaf and silent , read'st the eternal deep , Haunted for ever by the eternal mind ,— Mighty Prophet ! Seer blest ! On whom those truths do rest , Which we are toiling all our lives to find , In darkness lost , the darkness of the grave : Thou , over whom thy Immortality Broods like the Day , a master o'er a Slave , A Presence which is not to be put by ; Thou little Child , yet glorious in the might Of heaven-born freedom on thy being 's height , Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke The years to bring the inevitable yoke , Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife ? Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight , And Custom lie upon thee with a weight Heavy as frost , and deep almost as life !</p>
   <p>IX O joy ! that in our embers Is something that doth live , That nature yet remembers What was so fugitive ! The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benediction : not indeed For that which is most worthy to be blest — Delight and liberty , the simple creed Of Childhood , whether busy or at rest , With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast :— Not for these I raise The song of thanks and praise ; But for those obstinate questionings Of sense and outward things , Fallings from us , vanishings ; Blank misgivings of a Creature Moving about in worlds not realized , High instincts before which our mortal Nature Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised : But for those first affections , Those shadowy recollections , Which , be they what they may , Are yet the fountain-light of all our day , Are yet a master-light of all our seeing ; Uphold us , cherish , and have power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal Silence : truths that wake , To perish never ; Which neither listlessness , nor mad endeavor , Nor Man nor Boy , Nor all that is at enmity with joy , Can utterly abolish or destroy ! Hence , in a season of calm weather , Though inland far we be , Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea Which brought us hither , Can in a moment travel thither And see the children sport upon the shore , And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore .</p>
   <p>X Then sing , ye Birds , sing , sing a joyous song ! And let the young Lambs bound As to the tabor 's sound ! We in thought will join your throng , Ye that pipe and ye that play , Ye that through your hearts to-day Feel the gladness of the May ! What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now for ever taken from my sight , Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendor in the grass , of glory in the flower ; We will grieve not , rather find Strength in what remains behind ; In the primal sympathy Which having been must ever be ; In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering ; In the faith that looks through death , In years that bring the philosophic mind .</p>
   <p>XI And O , ye Fountains , Meadows , Hills , and Groves , Forebode not any severing of our loves ! Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might ; I only have relinquished one delight To live beneath your more habitual sway . I love the Brooks , which down their channels fret , Even more than when I tripped lightly as they : The innocent brightness of a new-born Day Is lovely yet ; The Clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober coloring from an eye That hath kept watch o'er man 's mortality ; Another race hath been , and other palms are won . Thanks to the human heart by which we live , Thanks to its tenderness , its joys , and fears , To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Do n't you remember sweet Alice , Ben Bolt ,—</l>
     <l n="2">Sweet Alice whose hair was so Brown ,</l>
     <l n="3">Who wept with delight when you gave her a smile ,</l>
     <l n="4">And trembled with fear at your frown ?</l>
     <l n="5">In the old churchyard in the valley , Ben Bolt ,</l>
     <l n="6">In a corner obscure and alone ,</l>
     <l n="7">They have fitted a slab of the granite so gray ,</l>
     <l n="8">And Alice lies under the stone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Under the hickory tree , Ben Bolt ,</l>
     <l n="10">Which stood at the foot of the hill ,</l>
     <l n="11">Together we 've lain in the noonday shade ,</l>
     <l n="12">And listened to Appleton 's mill .</l>
     <l n="13">The mill-wheel has fallen to pieces , Ben Bolt ,</l>
     <l n="14">The rafters have tumbled in ,</l>
     <l n="15">And a quiet which crawls round the walls as you gaze</l>
     <l n="16">Has followed the olden din .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Do you mind of the cabin of logs , Ben Bolt .</l>
     <l n="18">At the edge of the pathless wood ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the button-ball tree with its motley limbs ,</l>
     <l n="20">Which nigh by the doorstep stood ?</l>
     <l n="21">The cabin to ruin has gone , Ben Bolt ,</l>
     <l n="22">The tree you would seek for in vain ;</l>
     <l n="23">And where once the lords of the forest waved</l>
     <l n="24">Are grass and the golden grain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">And do n't you remember the school , Ben Bolt ,</l>
     <l n="26">With the master so cruel and grim ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the shaded nook in the running brook</l>
     <l n="28">Where the children went to swim ?</l>
     <l n="29">Grass grows on the master 's grave , Ben Bolt ,</l>
     <l n="30">The spring of the brook is dry ,</l>
     <l n="31">And of all the boys who were schoolmates then</l>
     <l n="32">There are only you and I .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">There is change in the things I loved , Ben Bolt ,</l>
     <l n="34">They have changed from the old to the new ;</l>
     <l n="35">But I feel in the deeps of my spirit the truth ,</l>
     <l n="36">There never was change in you .</l>
     <l n="37">Twelvemonths twenty have passed , Ben Bolt ,</l>
     <l n="38">Since first we were friends — yet I hail</l>
     <l n="39">Your presence a blessing , your friendship a truth ,</l>
