    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="1">No one expects a man to make a chair without first learning how , but there is a popular impression that the poet is born , not made , and that his verses burst from his overflowing heart of themselves . As a matter of fact , the poet must learn his trade in the same manner , and with the same painstaking care , as the cabinet-maker . His heart may overflow with high thoughts and sparkling fancies , but if he cannot convey them to his reader by means of the written word he has no claim to be considered a poet . A workman may be pardoned , therefore , for spending a few moments to explain and describe the technique of his trade . A work of beauty which cannot stand an intimate examination is a poor and jerry-built thing .</p>
    <p n="2">In the first place , I wish to state my firm belief that poetry should not try to teach , that it should exist simply because it is a created beauty , even if sometimes the beauty of a gothic grotesque . We do not ask the trees to teach us moral lessons , and only the Salvation Army feels it necessary to pin texts upon them . We know that these texts are ridiculous , but many of us do not yet see that to write an obvious moral all over a work of art , picture , statue , or poem , is not only ridiculous , but timid and vulgar . We distrust a beauty we only half understand , and rush in with our impertinent suggestions . How far we are from “ admitting the Universe ” ! The Universe , which flings down its continents and seas , and leaves them without comment . Art is as much a function of the Universe as an Equinoctial gale , or the Law of Gravitation ; and we insist upon considering it merely a little scroll-work , of no great importance unless it be studded with nails from which pretty and uplifting sentiments may be hung !</p>
    <p n="3">For the purely technical side I must state my immense debt to the French , and perhaps above all to the , so-called , Parnassian School , although some of the writers who have influenced me most do not belong to it . High-minded and untiring workmen , they have spared no pains to produce a poetry finer than that of any other country in our time . Poetry so full of beauty and feeling , that the study of it is at once an inspiration and a despair to the artist . The Anglo-Saxon of our day has a tendency to think that a fine idea excuses slovenly workmanship . These clear-eyed Frenchmen are a reproof to our self-satisfied laziness . Before the works of Parnassians like Leconte de Lisle , and José-Maria de Heredia , or those of Henri de Régnier , Albert Samain , Francis Jammes , Remy de Gourmont , and Paul Fort , of the more modern school , we stand rebuked . Indeed — “ They order this matter better in France . ”</p>
    <p n="4">It is because in France , to-day , poetry is so living and vigorous a thing , that so many metrical experiments come from there . Only a vigorous tree has the vitality to put forth new branches . The poet with originality and power is always seeking to give his readers the same poignant feeling which he has himself . To do this he must constantly find new and striking images , delightful and unexpected forms . Take the word “ daybreak ” , for instance . What a remarkable picture it must once have conjured up ! The great , round sun , like the yolk of some mighty egg , BREAKING through cracked and splintered clouds . But we have said “ daybreak ” so often that we do not see the picture any more , it has become only another word for dawn . The poet must be constantly seeking new pictures to make his readers feel the vitality of his thought .</p>
    <p n="5">Many of the poems in this volume are written in what the French call “ Vers Libre ” , a nomenclature more suited to French use and to French versification than to ours . I prefer to call them poems in “ unrhymed cadence ” , for that conveys their exact meaning to an English ear . They are built upon “ organic rhythm ” , or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing , rather than upon a strict metrical system . They differ from ordinary prose rhythms by being more curved , and containing more stress . The stress , and exceedingly marked curve , of any regular metre is easily perceived . These poems , built upon cadence , are more subtle , but the laws they follow are not less fixed . Merely chopping prose lines into lengths does not produce cadence , it is constructed upon mathematical and absolute laws of balance and time . In the preface to his “ Poems ” , Henley speaks of “ those unrhyming rhythms in which I had tried to quintessentialize , as ( I believe ) one scarce can do in rhyme . ” The desire to “ quintessentialize ” , to head-up an emotion until it burns white-hot , seems to be an integral part of the modern temper , and certainly “ unrhymed cadence ” is unique in its power of expressing this .</p>
    <p n="6">Three of these poems are written in a form which , so far as I know , has never before been attempted in English . M. Paul Fort is its inventor , and the results it has yielded to him are most beautiful and satisfactory . Perhaps it is more suited to the French language than to English . But I found it the only medium in which these particular poems could be written . It is a fluid and changing form , now prose , now verse , and permitting a great variety of treatment .</p>
    <p n="7">But the reader will see that I have not entirely abandoned the more classic English metres . I cannot see why , because certain manners suit certain emotions and subjects , it should be considered imperative for an author to employ no others . Schools are for those who can confine themselves within them . Perhaps it is a weakness in me that I cannot .</p>
    <p n="8">In conclusion , I would say that these remarks are in answer to many questions asked me by people who have happened to read some of these poems in periodicals . They are not for the purpose of forestalling criticism , nor of courting it ; and they deal , as I said in the beginning , solely with the question of technique . For the more important part of the book , the poems must speak for themselves .</p>

       <l n="2">A drifting , April , twilight sky ,</l>
       <l n="3">A wind which blew the puddles dry ,</l>
       <l n="4">And slapped the river into waves</l>
       <l n="5">That ran and hid among the staves</l>
       <l n="6">Of an old wharf . A watery light</l>
       <l n="7">Touched bleak the granite bridge , and white</l>
       <l n="8">Without the slightest tinge of gold ,</l>
       <l n="9">The city shivered in the cold .</l>
       <l n="10">All day my thoughts had lain as dead ,</l>
       <l n="11">Unborn and bursting in my head .</l>
       <l n="12">From time to time I wrote a word</l>
       <l n="13">Which lines and circles overscored .</l>
       <l n="14">My table seemed a graveyard , full</l>
       <l n="15">Of coffins waiting burial .</l>
       <l n="16">I seized these vile abortions , tore</l>
       <l n="17">Them into jagged bits , and swore</l>
       <l n="18">To be the dupe of hope no more .</l>
       <l n="19">Into the evening straight I went ,</l>
       <l n="20">Starved of a day 's accomplishment .</l>
       <l n="21">Unnoticing , I wandered where</l>
       <l n="22">The city gave a space for air ,</l>
       <l n="23">And on the bridge 's parapet</l>
       <l n="24">I leant , while pallidly there set</l>
       <l n="25">A dim , discouraged , worn-out sun .</l>
       <l n="26">Behind me , where the tramways run ,</l>
       <l n="27">Blossomed bright lights , I turned to leave ,</l>
       <l n="28">When someone plucked me by the sleeve .</l>
       <l n="29">“ Your pardon , Sir , but I should be</l>
       <l n="30">Most grateful could you lend to me</l>
       <l n="31">A carfare , I have lost my purse . ”</l>
       <l n="32">The voice was clear , concise , and terse .</l>
       <l n="33">I turned and met the quiet gaze</l>
       <l n="34">Of strange eyes flashing through the haze .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="35">The man was old and slightly bent ,</l>
       <l n="36">Under his cloak some instrument</l>
       <l n="37">Disarranged its stately line ,</l>
       <l n="38">He rested on his cane a fine</l>
       <l n="39">And nervous hand , an almandine</l>
       <l n="40">Smouldered with dull-red flames , sanguine</l>
       <l n="41">It burned in twisted gold , upon</l>
       <l n="42">His finger . Like some Spanish don ,</l>
       <l n="43">Conferring favours even when</l>
       <l n="44">Asking an alms , he bowed again</l>
       <l n="45">And waited . But my pockets proved</l>
       <l n="46">Empty , in vain I poked and shoved ,</l>
       <l n="47">No hidden penny lurking there</l>
       <l n="48">Greeted my search . “ Sir , I declare</l>
       <l n="49">I have no money , pray forgive ,</l>
       <l n="50">But let me take you where you live . ”</l>
       <l n="51">And so we plodded through the mire</l>
       <l n="52">Where street lamps cast a wavering fire .</l>
       <l n="53">I took no note of where we went ,</l>
       <l n="54">His talk became the element</l>
       <l n="55">Wherein my being swam , content .</l>
       <l n="56">It flashed like rapiers in the night</l>
       <l n="57">Lit by uncertain candle-light ,</l>
       <l n="58">When on some moon-forsaken sward</l>
       <l n="59">A quarrel dies upon a sword .</l>
       <l n="60">It hacked and carved like a cutlass blade ,</l>
       <l n="61">And the noise in the air the broad words made</l>
       <l n="62">Was the cry of the wind at a window-pane</l>
       <l n="63">On an Autumn night of sobbing rain .</l>
       <l n="64">Then it would run like a steady stream</l>
       <l n="65">Under pinnacled bridges where minarets gleam ,</l>
       <l n="66">Or lap the air like the lapping tide</l>
       <l n="67">Where a marble staircase lifts its wide</l>
       <l n="68">Green-spotted steps to a garden gate ,</l>
       <l n="69">And a waning moon is sinking straight</l>
       <l n="70">Down to a black and ominous sea ,</l>
       <l n="71">While a nightingale sings in a lemon tree .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="72">I walked as though some opiate</l>
       <l n="73">Had stung and dulled my brain , a state</l>
       <l n="74">Acute and slumbrous . It grew late .</l>
       <l n="75">We stopped , a house stood silent , dark .</l>
       <l n="76">The old man scratched a match , the spark</l>
       <l n="77">Lit up the keyhole of a door ,</l>
       <l n="78">We entered straight upon a floor</l>
       <l n="79">White with finest powdered sand</l>
       <l n="80">Carefully sifted , one might stand</l>
       <l n="81">Muddy and dripping , and yet no trace</l>
       <l n="82">Would stain the boards of this kitchen-place .</l>
       <l n="83">From the chimney , red eyes sparked the gloom ,</l>
       <l n="84">And a cricket 's chirp filled all the room .</l>
       <l n="85">My host threw pine-cones on the fire</l>
       <l n="86">And crimson and scarlet glowed the pyre</l>
       <l n="87">Wrapped in the golden flame 's desire .</l>
       <l n="88">The chamber opened like an eye ,</l>
       <l n="89">As a half-melted cloud in a Summer sky</l>
       <l n="90">The soul of the house stood guessed , and shy</l>
       <l n="91">It peered at the stranger warily .</l>
       <l n="92">A little shop with its various ware</l>
       <l n="93">Spread on shelves with nicest care .</l>
       <l n="94">Pitchers , and jars , and jugs , and pots ,</l>
       <l n="95">Pipkins , and mugs , and many lots</l>
       <l n="96">Of lacquered canisters , black and gold ,</l>
       <l n="97">Like those in which Chinese tea is sold .</l>
       <l n="98">Chests , and puncheons , kegs , and flasks ,</l>
       <l n="99">Goblets , chalices , firkins , and casks .</l>
       <l n="100">In a corner three ancient amphorae leaned</l>
       <l n="101">Against the wall , like ships careened .</l>
       <l n="102">There was dusky blue of Wedgewood ware ,</l>
       <l n="103">The carved , white figures fluttering there</l>
       <l n="104">Like leaves adrift upon the air .</l>
       <l n="105">Classic in touch , but emasculate ,</l>
       <l n="106">The Greek soul grown effeminate .</l>
       <l n="107">The factory of Sevres had lent</l>
       <l n="108">Elegant boxes with ornament</l>
       <l n="109">Culled from gardens where fountains splashed</l>
       <l n="110">And golden carp in the shadows flashed ,</l>
       <l n="111">Nuzzling for crumbs under lily-pads ,</l>
       <l n="112">Which ladies threw as the last of fads .</l>
       <l n="113">Eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt ,</l>
       <l n="114">Hand on heart , and daintily spelt</l>
       <l n="115">Their love in flowers , brittle and bright ,</l>
       <l n="116">Artificial and fragile , which told aright</l>
       <l n="117">The vows of an eighteenth-century knight .</l>
       <l n="118">The cruder tones of old Dutch jugs</l>
       <l n="119">Glared from one shelf , where Toby mugs</l>
       <l n="120">Endlessly drank the foaming ale ,</l>
       <l n="121">Its froth grown dusty , awaiting sale .</l>
       <l n="122">The glancing light of the burning wood</l>
       <l n="123">Played over a group of jars which stood</l>
       <l n="124">On a distant shelf , it seemed the sky</l>
       <l n="125">Had lent the half-tones of his blazonry</l>
       <l n="126">To paint these porcelains with unknown hues</l>
       <l n="127">Of reds dyed purple and greens turned blues ,</l>
       <l n="128">Of lustres with so evanescent a sheen</l>
       <l n="129">Their colours are felt , but never seen .</l>
       <l n="130">Strange winged dragons writhe about</l>
       <l n="131">These vases , poisoned venoms spout ,</l>
       <l n="132">Impregnate with old Chinese charms ;</l>
       <l n="133">Sealed urns containing mortal harms ,</l>
       <l n="134">They fill the mind with thoughts impure ,</l>
       <l n="135">Pestilent drippings from the ure</l>
       <l n="136">Of vicious thinkings . “ Ah , I see , ”</l>
       <l n="137">Said I , “ you deal in pottery . ”</l>
       <l n="138">The old man turned and looked at me .</l>
       <l n="139">Shook his head gently . “ No , ” said he .</l>

       <l n="143">As he laid it down it flashed in the light ,</l>
       <l n="144">A Toledo blade , with basket hilt ,</l>
       <l n="145">Damascened with arabesques of gilt ,</l>
       <l n="146">Or rather gold , and tempered so</l>
       <l n="147">It could cut a floating thread at a blow .</l>
       <l n="148">The old man smiled , “ It has no sheath ,</l>
       <l n="149">‘ Twas a little careless to have it beneath</l>
       <l n="150">My cloak , for a jostle to my arm</l>
       <l n="151">Would have resulted in serious harm .</l>
       <l n="152">But it was so fine , I could not wait ,</l>
       <l n="153">So I brought it with me despite its state . ”</l>
       <l n="154">“ An amateur of arms , ” I thought ,</l>
       <l n="155">“ Bringing home a prize which he has bought . ”</l>
       <l n="156">“ You care for this sort of thing , Dear Sir ? ”</l>
       <l n="157">“ Not in the way which you infer .</l>
       <l n="158">I need them in business , that is all . ”</l>
       <l n="159">And he pointed his finger at the wall .</l>
       <l n="160">Then I saw what I had not noticed before .</l>
       <l n="161">The walls were hung with at least five score</l>
       <l n="162">Of swords and daggers of every size</l>
       <l n="163">Which nations of militant men could devise .</l>
       <l n="164">Poisoned spears from tropic seas ,</l>
       <l n="165">That natives , under banana trees ,</l>
       <l n="166">Smear with the juice of some deadly snake .</l>
       <l n="167">Blood-dipped arrows , which savages make</l>
       <l n="168">And tip with feathers , orange and green ,</l>
       <l n="169">A quivering death , in harlequin sheen .</l>
       <l n="170">High up , a fan of glancing steel</l>
       <l n="171">Was formed of claymores in a wheel .</l>
       <l n="172">Jewelled swords worn at kings ’ levees</l>
       <l n="173">Were suspended next midshipmen 's dirks , and these</l>
       <l n="174">Elbowed stilettos come from Spain ,</l>
       <l n="175">Chased with some splendid Hidalgo 's name .</l>
       <l n="176">There were Samurai swords from old Japan ,</l>
       <l n="177">And scimitars from Hindoostan ,</l>
       <l n="178">While the blade of a Turkish yataghan</l>
       <l n="179">Made a waving streak of vitreous white</l>
       <l n="180">Upon the wall , in the firelight .</l>
       <l n="181">Foils with buttons broken or lost</l>
       <l n="182">Lay heaped on a chair , among them tossed</l>
       <l n="183">The boarding-pike of a privateer .</l>
       <l n="184">Against the chimney leaned a queer</l>
       <l n="185">Two-handed weapon , with edges dull</l>
       <l n="186">As though from hacking on a skull .</l>
       <l n="187">The rusted blood corroded it still .</l>
       <l n="188">My host took up a paper spill</l>
       <l n="189">From a heap which lay in an earthen bowl ,</l>
       <l n="190">And lighted it at a burning coal .</l>
       <l n="191">At either end of the table , tall</l>
       <l n="192">Wax candles were placed , each in a small ,</l>
       <l n="193">And slim , and burnished candlestick</l>
       <l n="194">Of pewter . The old man lit each wick ,</l>
       <l n="195">And the room leapt more obviously</l>
       <l n="196">Upon my mind , and I could see</l>
       <l n="197">What the flickering fire had hid from me .</l>
       <l n="198">Above the chimney 's yawning throat ,</l>
       <l n="199">Shoulder high , like the dark wainscote ,</l>
       <l n="200">Was a mantelshelf of polished oak</l>
       <l n="201">Blackened with the pungent smoke</l>
       <l n="202">Of firelit nights ; a Cromwell clock</l>
       <l n="203">Of tarnished brass stood like a rock</l>
       <l n="204">In the midst of a heaving , turbulent sea</l>
       <l n="205">Of every sort of cutlery .</l>
       <l n="206">There lay knives sharpened to any use ,</l>
       <l n="207">The keenest lancet , and the obtuse</l>
       <l n="208">And blunted pruning bill-hook ; blades</l>
       <l n="209">Of razors , scalpels , shears ; cascades</l>
       <l n="210">Of penknives , with handles of mother-of-pearl ,</l>
       <l n="211">And scythes , and sickles , and scissors ; a whirl</l>
       <l n="212">Of points and edges , and underneath</l>
       <l n="213">Shot the gleam of a saw with bristling teeth .</l>
       <l n="214">My head grew dizzy , I seemed to hear</l>
       <l n="215">A battle-cry from somewhere near ,</l>
       <l n="216">The clash of arms , and the squeal of balls ,</l>
       <l n="217">And the echoless thud when a dead man falls .</l>
       <l n="218">A smoky cloud had veiled the room ,</l>
       <l n="219">Shot through with lurid glares ; the gloom</l>
       <l n="220">Pounded with shouts and dying groans ,</l>
       <l n="221">With the drip of blood on cold , hard stones .</l>
       <l n="222">Sabres and lances in streaks of light</l>
       <l n="223">Gleamed through the smoke , and at my right</l>
       <l n="224">A creese , like a licking serpent 's tongue ,</l>
       <l n="225">Glittered an instant , while it stung .</l>
       <l n="226">Streams , and points , and lines of fire !</l>
       <l n="227">The livid steel , which man 's desire</l>
       <l n="228">Had forged and welded , burned white and cold .</l>
       <l n="229">Every blade which man could mould ,</l>
       <l n="230">Which could cut , or slash , or cleave , or rip ,</l>
       <l n="231">Or pierce , or thrust , or carve , or strip ,</l>
       <l n="232">Or gash , or chop , or puncture , or tear ,</l>
       <l n="233">Or slice , or hack , they all were there .</l>
       <l n="234">Nerveless and shaking , round and round ,</l>
       <l n="235">I stared at the walls and at the ground ,</l>
       <l n="236">Till the room spun like a whipping top ,</l>
       <l n="237">And a stern voice in my ear said , “ Stop !</l>
       <l n="238">I sell no tools for murderers here .</l>
       <l n="239">Of what are you thinking ! Please clear</l>
       <l n="240">Your mind of such imaginings .</l>
       <l n="241">Sit down . I will tell you of these things . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="242">He pushed me into a great chair</l>
       <l n="243">Of russet leather , poked a flare</l>
       <l n="244">Of tumbling flame , with the old long sword ,</l>
       <l n="245">Up the chimney ; but said no word .</l>
       <l n="246">Slowly he walked to a distant shelf ,</l>
       <l n="247">And brought back a crock of finest delf .</l>
       <l n="248">He rested a moment a blue-veined hand</l>
       <l n="249">Upon the cover , then cut a band</l>
       <l n="250">Of paper , pasted neatly round ,</l>
       <l n="251">Opened and poured . A sliding sound</l>
       <l n="252">Came from beneath his old white hands ,</l>
       <l n="253">And I saw a little heap of sands ,</l>
       <l n="254">Black and smooth . What could they be :</l>
       <l n="255">“ Pepper , ” I thought . He looked at me .</l>
       <l n="256">“ What you see is poppy seed .</l>
       <l n="257">Lethean dreams for those in need . ”</l>
       <l n="258">He took up the grains with a gentle hand</l>
       <l n="259">And sifted them slowly like hour-glass sand .</l>
       <l n="260">On his old white finger the almandine</l>
       <l n="261">Shot out its rays , incarnadine .</l>
       <l n="262">“ Visions for those too tired to sleep .</l>
       <l n="263">These seeds cast a film over eyes which weep .</l>
       <l n="264">No single soul in the world could dwell ,</l>
       <l n="265">Without these poppy-seeds I sell . ”</l>
       <l n="266">For a moment he played with the shining stuff ,</l>
       <l n="267">Passing it through his fingers . Enough</l>
       <l n="268">At last , he poured it back into</l>
       <l n="269">The china jar of Holland blue ,</l>
       <l n="270">Which he carefully carried to its place .</l>
       <l n="271">Then , with a smile on his aged face ,</l>
       <l n="272">He drew up a chair to the open space</l>
       <l n="273">‘ Twixt table and chimney . “ Without preface ,</l>
       <l n="274">Young man , I will say that what you see</l>
       <l n="275">Is not the puzzle you take it to be . ”</l>
       <l n="276">“ But surely , Sir , there is something strange</l>
       <l n="277">In a shop with goods at so wide a range</l>
       <l n="278">Each from the other , as swords and seeds .</l>
       <l n="279">Your neighbours must have greatly differing needs . ”</l>
       <l n="280">“ My neighbours , ” he said , and he stroked his chin ,</l>
       <l n="281">“ Live everywhere from here to Pekin .</l>
       <l n="282">But you are wrong , my sort of goods</l>
       <l n="283">Is but one thing in all its moods . ”</l>
       <l n="284">He took a shagreen letter case</l>
       <l n="285">From his pocket , and with charming grace</l>
       <l n="286">Offered me a printed card .</l>
       <l n="287">I read the legend , “ Ephraim Bard .</l>
       <l n="288">Dealer in Words . ” And that was all .</l>
       <l n="289">I stared at the letters , whimsical</l>
       <l n="290">Indeed , or was it merely a jest .</l>
       <l n="291">He answered my unasked request :</l>
       <l n="292">“ All books are either dreams or swords ,</l>
       <l n="293">You can cut , or you can drug , with words .</l>
       <l n="294">My firm is a very ancient house ,</l>
       <l n="295">The entries on my books would rouse</l>
       <l n="296">Your wonder , perhaps incredulity .</l>
       <l n="297">I inherited from an ancestry</l>
       <l n="298">Stretching remotely back and far ,</l>
       <l n="299">This business , and my clients are</l>
       <l n="300">As were those of my grandfather 's days ,</l>
       <l n="301">Writers of books , and poems , and plays .</l>
       <l n="302">My swords are tempered for every speech ,</l>
       <l n="303">For fencing wit , or to carve a breach</l>
       <l n="304">Through old abuses the world condones .</l>
       <l n="305">In another room are my grindstones and hones ,</l>
       <l n="306">For whetting razors and putting a point</l>
       <l n="307">On daggers , sometimes I even anoint</l>
       <l n="308">The blades with a subtle poison , so</l>
       <l n="309">A twofold result may follow the blow .</l>
       <l n="310">These are purchased by men who feel</l>
       <l n="311">The need of stabbing society 's heel ,</l>
       <l n="312">Which egotism has brought them to think</l>
       <l n="313">Is set on their necks . I have foils to pink</l>
       <l n="314">An adversary to quaint reply ,</l>
       <l n="315">And I have customers who buy</l>
       <l n="316">Scalpels with which to dissect the brains</l>
       <l n="317">And hearts of men . Ultramundanes</l>
       <l n="318">Even demand some finer kinds</l>
       <l n="319">To open their own souls and minds .</l>
       <l n="320">But the other half of my business deals</l>
       <l n="321">With visions and fancies . Under seals ,</l>
       <l n="322">Sorted , and placed in vessels here ,</l>
       <l n="323">I keep the seeds of an atmosphere .</l>
       <l n="324">Each jar contains a different kind</l>
       <l n="325">Of poppy seed . From farthest Ind</l>
       <l n="326">Come the purple flowers , opium filled ,</l>
       <l n="327">From which the weirdest myths are distilled ;</l>
       <l n="328">My orient porcelains contain them all .</l>
       <l n="329">Those Lowestoft pitchers against the wall</l>
       <l n="330">Hold a lighter kind of bright conceit ;</l>
       <l n="331">And those old Saxe vases , out of the heat</l>
       <l n="332">On that lowest shelf beside the door ,</l>
       <l n="333">Have a sort of Ideal , “ couleur d'or ” .</l>
       <l n="334">Every castle of the air</l>
       <l n="335">Sleeps in the fine black grains , and there</l>
       <l n="336">Are seeds for every romance , or light</l>
       <l n="337">Whiff of a dream for a summer night .</l>
       <l n="338">I supply to every want and taste . ”</l>
       <l n="339">‘ Twas slowly said , in no great haste</l>
       <l n="340">He seemed to push his wares , but I</l>
       <l n="341">Dumfounded listened . By and by</l>
       <l n="342">A log on the fire broke in two .</l>
       <l n="343">He looked up quickly , “ Sir , and you ? ”</l>
       <l n="344">I groped for something I should say ;</l>
       <l n="345">Amazement held me numb . “ To-day</l>
       <l n="346">You sweated at a fruitless task . ”</l>
       <l n="347">He spoke for me , “ What do you ask ?</l>
       <l n="348">How can I serve you ? ” “ My kind host ,</l>
       <l n="349">My penniless state was not a boast ;</l>
       <l n="350">I have no money with me . ” He smiled .</l>
       <l n="351">“ Not for that money I beguiled</l>
       <l n="352">You here ; you paid me in advance . ”</l>
       <l n="353">Again I felt as though a trance</l>
       <l n="354">Had dimmed my faculties . Again</l>
       <l n="355">He spoke , and this time to explain .</l>
       <l n="356">“ The money I demand is Life ,</l>
       <l n="357">Your nervous force , your joy , your strife ! ”</l>
       <l n="358">What infamous proposal now</l>
       <l n="359">Was made me with so calm a brow ?</l>
       <l n="360">Bursting through my lethargy ,</l>
       <l n="361">Indignantly I hurled the cry :</l>
       <l n="362">“ Is this a nightmare , or am I</l>
       <l n="363">Drunk with some infernal wine ?</l>
       <l n="364">I am no Faust , and what is mine</l>
       <l n="365">Is what I call my soul ! Old Man !</l>
       <l n="366">Devil or Ghost ! Your hellish plan</l>
       <l n="367">Revolts me . Let me go . ” “ My child , ”</l>
       <l n="368">And the old tones were very mild ,</l>
       <l n="369">“ I have no wish to barter souls ;</l>
       <l n="370">My traffic does not ask such tolls .</l>
       <l n="371">I am no devil ; is there one ?</l>
       <l n="372">Surely the age of fear is gone .</l>
       <l n="373">We live within a daylight world</l>
       <l n="374">Lit by the sun , where winds unfurled</l>
       <l n="375">Sweep clouds to scatter pattering rain ,</l>
       <l n="376">And then blow back the sun again .</l>
       <l n="377">I sell my fancies , or my swords ,</l>
       <l n="378">To those who care far more for words ,</l>
       <l n="379">Ideas , of which they are the sign ,</l>
       <l n="380">Than any other life-design .</l>
       <l n="381">Who buy of me must simply pay</l>
       <l n="382">Their whole existence quite away :</l>
       <l n="383">Their strength , their manhood , and their prime ,</l>
       <l n="384">Their hours from morning till the time</l>
       <l n="385">When evening comes on tiptoe feet ,</l>
       <l n="386">And losing life , think it complete ;</l>
       <l n="387">Must miss what other men count being ,</l>
       <l n="388">To gain the gift of deeper seeing ;</l>
       <l n="389">Must spurn all ease , all hindering love ,</l>
       <l n="390">All which could hold or bind ; must prove</l>
       <l n="391">The farthest boundaries of thought ,</l>
       <l n="392">And shun no end which these have brought ;</l>
       <l n="393">Then die in satisfaction , knowing</l>
       <l n="394">That what was sown was worth the sowing .</l>
       <l n="395">I claim for all the goods I sell</l>
       <l n="396">That they will serve their purpose well ,</l>
       <l n="397">And though you perish , they will live .</l>
       <l n="398">Full measure for your pay I give .</l>
       <l n="399">To-day you worked , you thought , in vain .</l>
       <l n="400">What since has happened is the train</l>
       <l n="401">Your toiling brought . I spoke to you</l>
       <l n="402">For my share of the bargain , due . ”</l>
       <l n="403">“ My life ! And is that all you crave</l>
       <l n="404">In pay ? What even childhood gave !</l>
       <l n="405">I have been dedicate from youth .</l>
       <l n="406">Before my God I speak the truth ! ”</l>
       <l n="407">Fatigue , excitement of the past</l>
       <l n="408">Few hours broke me down at last .</l>
       <l n="409">All day I had forgot to eat ,</l>
       <l n="410">My nerves betrayed me , lacking meat .</l>
       <l n="411">I bowed my head and felt the storm</l>
       <l n="412">Plough shattering through my prostrate form .</l>
       <l n="413">The tearless sobs tore at my heart .</l>
       <l n="414">My host withdrew himself apart ;</l>
       <l n="415">Busied among his crockery ,</l>
       <l n="416">He paid no farther heed to me .</l>
       <l n="417">Exhausted , spent , I huddled there ,</l>
       <l n="418">Within the arms of the old carved chair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="419">A long half-hour dragged away ,</l>
       <l n="420">And then I heard a kind voice say ,</l>
       <l n="421">“ The day will soon be dawning , when</l>

       <l n="423">Here are the things which you require . ”</l>
       <l n="424">By the fading light of the dying fire ,</l>
       <l n="425">And by the guttering candle 's flare ,</l>
       <l n="426">I saw the old man standing there .</l>
       <l n="427">He handed me a packet , tied</l>
       <l n="428">With crimson tape , and sealed . “ Inside</l>

     <p>The inkstand is full of ink , and the paper lies white and unspotted , in the round of light thrown by a candle . Puffs of darkness sweep into the corners , and keep rolling through the room behind his chair . The air is silver and pearl , for the night is liquid with moonlight .</p>
     <p>See how the roof glitters , like ice !</p>
     <p>Over there , a slice of yellow cuts into the silver-blue , and beside it stand two geraniums , purple because the light is silver-blue , to-night .</p>
     <p>See ! She is coming , the young woman with the bright hair . She swings a basket as she walks , which she places on the sill , between the geranium stalks . He laughs , and crumples his paper as he leans forward to look . “ The Basket Filled with Moonlight ” , what a title for a book !</p>
     <p>The bellying clouds swing over the housetops .</p>
     <p>He has forgotten the woman in the room with the geraniums . He is beating his brain , and in his eardrums hammers his heavy pulse . She sits on the window-sill , with the basket in her lap . And tap ! She cracks a nut . And tap ! Another . Tap ! Tap ! Tap ! The shells ricochet upon the roof , and get into the gutters , and bounce over the edge and disappear .</p>

     <p>II</p>
     <p>Five o'clock . The geraniums are very gay in their crimson array . The bellying clouds swing over the housetops , and over the roofs goes Peter to pay his morning 's work with a holiday .</p>
     <p>“ Annette , it is I . Have you finished ? Can I come ? ”</p>
     <p>Peter jumps through the window .</p>
     <p>“ Dear , are you alone ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Look , Peter , the dome of the tabernacle is done . This gold thread is so very high , I am glad it is morning , a starry sky would have seen me bankrupt . Sit down , now tell me , is your story going well ? ”</p>
     <p>The golden dome glittered in the orange of the setting sun . On the walls , at intervals , hung altar-cloths and chasubles , and copes , and stoles , and coffin palls . All stiff with rich embroidery , and stitched with so much artistry , they seemed like spun and woven gems , or flower-buds new-opened on their stems .</p>
     <p>Annette looked at the geraniums , very red against the blue sky .</p>
     <p>“ No matter how I try , I cannot find any thread of such a red . My bleeding hearts drip stuff muddy in comparison . Heigh-ho ! See my little pecking dove ? I 'm in love with my own temple . Only that halo 's wrong . The colour 's too strong , or not strong enough . I do n't know . My eyes are tired . Oh , Peter , do n't be so rough ; it is valuable . I wo n't do any more . I promise . You tyrannise , Dear , that 's enough . Now sit down and amuse me while I rest . ”</p>
     <p>The shadows of the geraniums creep over the floor , and begin to climb the opposite wall .</p>
     <p>Peter watches her , fluid with fatigue , floating , and drifting , and undulant in the orange glow . His senses flow towards her , where she lies supine and dreaming . Seeming drowned in a golden halo .</p>
     <p>The pungent smell of the geraniums is hard to bear .</p>
     <p>He pushes against her knees , and brushes his lips across her languid hands . His lips are hot and speechless . He woos her , quivering , and the room is filled with shadows , for the sun has set . But she only understands the ways of a needle through delicate stuffs , and the shock of one colour on another . She does not see that this is the same , and querulously murmurs his name .</p>
     <p>“ Peter , I do n't want it . I am tired . ”</p>
     <p>And he , the undesired , burns and is consumed .</p>
     <p>There is a crescent moon on the rim of the sky .</p>
     <lg type="poem">

       <l n="1">“ Go home , now , Peter . To-night is full moon . I must be alone . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ How soon the moon is full again ! Annette , let me stay . Indeed , Dear Love , I shall not go away . My God , but you keep me starved ! You write ` No Entrance Here ’ , over all the doors . Is it not strange , my Dear , that loving , yet you deny me entrance everywhere . Would marriage strike you blind , or , hating bonds as you do , why should I be denied the rights of loving if I leave you free ? You want the whole of me , you pick my brains to rest you , but you give me not one heart-beat . Oh , forgive me , Sweet ! I suffer in my loving , and you know it . I cannot feed my life on being a poet . Let me stay . ”</p>
     <p>“ As you please , poor Peter , but it will hurt me if you do . It will crush your heart and squeeze the love out . ”</p>
     <p>He answered gruffly , “ I know what I 'm about . ”</p>
     <p>“ Only remember one thing from to-night . My work is taxing and I must have sight ! I must ! ”</p>
     <p>The clear moon looks in between the geraniums . On the wall , the shadow of the man is divided from the shadow of the woman by a silver thread .</p>
     <p>They are eyes , hundreds of eyes , round like marbles ! Unwinking , for there are no lids . Blue , black , gray , and hazel , and the irises are cased in the whites , and they glitter and spark under the moon . The basket is heaped with human eyes . She cracks off the whites and throws them away . They ricochet upon the roof , and get into the gutters , and bounce over the edge and disappear . But she is here , quietly sitting on the window-sill , eating human eyes .</p>
     <p>The silver-blue moonlight makes the geraniums purple , and the roof shines like ice .</p>

     <p>The air is of silver and pearl , for the night is liquid with moonlight . How the ruin glistens , like a palace of ice ! Only two black holes swallow the brilliance of the moon . Deflowered windows , sockets without sight .</p>

      <head>I</head>
      <head>Over the yawning chimney hangs the fog . Drip — hiss — drip — hiss — fall the raindrops on the oaken log which burns , and steams , and smokes the ceiling beams . Drip — hiss — the rain never stops .</head>
      <head>The wide , state bed shivers beneath its velvet coverlet . Above , dim , in the smoke , a tarnished coronet gleams dully . Overhead hammers and chinks the rain . Fearfully wails the wind down distant corridors , and there comes the swish and sigh of rushes lifted off the floors . The arras blows sidewise out from the wall , and then falls back again .</head>
       <l n="1">It is my lady 's key , confided with much nice cunning , whisperingly .</l>
       <l n="2">He enters on a sob of wind , which gutters the candles almost to swaling .</l>
       <l n="3">The fire flutters and drops . Drip — hiss — the rain never stops .</l>
       <l n="4">He shuts the door . The rushes fall again to stillness along the floor .</l>
       <l n="5">Outside , the wind goes wailing .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The velvet coverlet of the wide bed is smooth and cold . Above , in the firelight , winks the coronet of tarnished gold . The knight shivers in his coat of fur , and holds out his hands to the withering flame . She is always the same , a sweet coquette . He will wait for her .</p>
     <p>How the log hisses and drips ! How warm and satisfying will be her lips !</p>
     <p>It is wide and cold , the state bed ; but when her head lies under the coronet , and her eyes are full and wet with love , and when she holds out her arms , and the velvet counterpane half slips from her , and alarms her trembling modesty , how eagerly he will leap to cover her , and blot himself beneath the quilt , making her laugh and tremble .</p>
     <p>Is it guilt to free a lady from her palsied lord , absent and fighting , terribly abhorred ?</p>
     <p>He stirs a booted heel and kicks a rolling coal . His spur clinks on the hearth . Overhead , the rain hammers and chinks . She is so pure and whole . Only because he has her soul will she resign herself to him , for where the soul has gone , the body must be given as a sign . He takes her by the divine right of the only lover . He has sworn to fight her lord , and wed her after . Should he be overborne , she will die adoring him , forlorn , shriven by her great love .</p>

     <p>The room is filled with lisps and whispers . Something mutters . One candle drowns and the other gutters . Is that the rain which pads and patters , is it the wind through the winding entries which chatters ?</p>
     <p>The state bed is very cold and he is alone . How far from the wall the arras is blown !</p>
     <p>Christ 's Death ! It is no storm which makes these little chuckling sounds . By the Great Wounds of Holy Jesus , it is his dear lady , kissing and clasping someone ! Through the sobbing storm he hears her love take form and flutter out in words . They prick into his ears and stun his desire , which lies within him , hard and dead , like frozen fire . And the little noise never stops .</p>
     <p>Drip — hiss — the rain drops .</p>
     <p>He tears down the arras from before an inner chamber 's bolted door .</p>

     <p>On the velvet coverlet lie two bodies , stripped and fair in the cold , grey air . Drip — hiss — fall the blood-drops , for the bleeding never stops . The bodies lie quietly . At each side of the bed , on the floor , is a head . A man 's on this side , a woman 's on that , and the red blood oozes along the rush mat .</p>
     <p>A wisp of paper is twisted carefully into the strands of the dead man 's hair . It says , “ My Lord : Your wife 's paramour has paid with his life for the high favour . ”</p>
     <p>Through the lady 's silver fillet is wound another paper . It reads , “ Most noble Lord : Your wife 's misdeeds are as a double-stranded necklace of beads . But I have engaged that , on your return , she shall welcome you here . She will not spurn your love as before , you have still the best part of her . Her blood was red , her body white , they will both be here for your delight . The soul inside was a lump of dirt , I have rid you of that with a spurt of my sword point . Good luck to your pleasure . She will be quite complaisant , my friend , I wager . ” The end was a splashed flourish of ink .</p>
     <p>Hark ! In the passage is heard the clink of armour , the tread of a heavy man . The door bursts open and standing there , his thin hair wavering in the glare of steely daylight , is my Lord of Clair .</p>
     <p>Over the yawning chimney hangs the fog . Drip — hiss — drip — hiss — fall the raindrops . Overhead hammers and chinks the rain which never stops .</p>

        <l n="418">And he paid in jewels for his slobbering kisses .</l>
        <l n="419">This watch was made to buy him blisses</l>
        <l n="420">From an Austrian countess on her way</l>
        <l n="421">Home , and she meant to start next day .</l>

        <l n="423">Of a tallow candle , and became</l>
        <l n="424">So absorbed , that his old clock made him wince</l>

        <l n="426">Its echo , only half apprehended ,</l>
        <l n="427">Lingered about the room . He ended</l>
        <l n="428">Screwing the little rubies in ,</l>

        <l n="430">Curling the infinitesimal springs ,</l>

        <l n="436">A heap of emeralds , and steel .</l>
        <l n="437">Here was a gem , there was a wheel .</l>
        <l n="438">And glasses lay like limpid lakes</l>
        <l n="439">Shining and still , and there were flakes</l>

        <l n="441">And little wires all awhirl</l>
        <l n="442">With the light of the candle . He took the watch</l>

        <l n="446">Good , Merciful Power !</l>
        <l n="447">How came that shadow on the wall ,</l>
        <l n="448">No woman was in the room ! His tall</l>
        <l n="449">Chiffonier stood gaunt behind</l>
        <l n="450">His chair . His old cloak , rabbit-lined ,</l>
        <l n="451">Hung from a peg . The door was closed .</l>

        <l n="456">Even when the candle quavered</l>
        <l n="457">Under his panting breath . What made</l>
        <l n="458">That beautiful , dreadful thing , that shade</l>
        <l n="459">Of something so lovely , so exquisite ,</l>
        <l n="460">Cast from a substance which the sight</l>

        <l n="488">He saw , in the patch of light , the gloom</l>

     <p>Holy Mother of God , Merciful Mary . Hear me ! I am very weary . I have come from a village miles away , all day I have been coming , and I ache for such far roaming . I cannot walk as light as I used , and my thoughts grow confused . I am heavier than I was . Mary Mother , you know the cause !</p>
     <p>Beautiful Holy Lady , take my shame away from me ! Let this fear be only seeming , let it be that I am dreaming . For months I have hoped it was so , now I am afraid I know . Lady , why should this be shame , just because I have n't got his name . He loved me , yes , Lady , he did , and he could n't keep it hid . We meant to marry . Why did he die ?</p>
     <p>That day when they told me he had gone down in the avalanche , and could not be found until the snow melted in Spring , I did nothing . I could not cry . Why should he die ? Why should he die and his child live ? His little child alive in me , for my comfort . No , Good God , for my misery ! I cannot face the shame , to be a mother , and not married , and the poor child to be reviled for having no father . Merciful Mother , Holy Virgin , take away this sin I did . Let the baby not be . Only take the stigma off of me !</p>
     <p>I have told no one but you , Holy Mary . My mother would call me “ whore ” , and spit upon me ; the priest would have me repent , and have the rest of my life spent in a convent . I am no whore , no bad woman , he loved me , and we were to be married . I carried him always in my heart , what did it matter if I gave him the least part of me too ? You were a virgin , Holy Mother , but you had a son , you know there are times when a woman must give all . There is some call to give and hold back nothing . I swear I obeyed God then , and this child who lives in me is the sign . What am I saying ? He is dead , my beautiful , strong man ! I shall never feel him caress me again . This is the only baby I shall have . Oh , Holy Virgin , protect my baby ! My little , helpless baby !</p>

       <l n="5">out of white wood . Oh , No ! No ! No ! How can I think such things ,</l>
       <l n="6">I am not good . My father will have nothing to do with my boy ,</l>
       <l n="7">I shall be an outcast thing . Oh , Mother of our Lord God , be merciful ,</l>
       <l n="8">take away my shame ! Let my body be as it was before he came .</l>
       <l n="9">No little baby for me to keep underneath my heart for those long months .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="14">And I shall have nothing , nothing ! Just be known as a good girl .</l>

       <l n="16">my man . Known the length and breadth of his beautiful white body ,</l>
       <l n="17">and the depth of his love , on the high Summer Alp , with the moon above ,</l>
       <l n="18">and the pine-needles all shiny in the light of it . He is gone , my man ,</l>
       <l n="19">I shall never hear him or feel him again , but I could not touch another .</l>
       <l n="20">I would rather lie under the snow with my own man in my arms !</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>So I shall live on and on . Just a good woman . With nothing to warm my heart where he lay , and where he left his baby for me to care for . I shall not be quite human , I think . Merely a stone-dead creature . They will respect me . What do I care for respect ! You did n't care for people 's tongues when you were carrying our Lord Jesus . God had my man give me my baby , when He knew that He was going to take him away . His lips will comfort me , his hands will soothe me . All day I will work at my lace-making , and all night I will keep him warm by my side and pray the blessed Angels to cover him with their wings . Dear Mother , what is it that sings ? I hear voices singing , and lovely silver trumpets through it all . They seem just on the other side of the wall . Let me keep my baby , Holy Mother . He is only a poor lace-maker 's baby , with a stain upon him , but give me strength to bring him up to be a man .</p>
