    <head>THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Years , years ago , ere yet my dreams</l>
     <l n="2">Had been of being wise or witty ;</l>
     <l n="3">Ere I had done with writing themes ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or yawned o'er this infernal Chitty ;—</l>
     <l n="5">Years , years ago , while all my joy</l>
     <l n="6">Were in my fowling-piece and filly ;</l>
     <l n="7">In short , while I was yet a boy ,</l>
     <l n="8">I fell in love with Laura Lilly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">I saw her at the County Ball ;</l>
     <l n="10">There , when the sounds of flute and fiddle</l>
     <l n="11">Gave signal sweet in that old hall</l>
     <l n="12">Of hands across and down the middle ,</l>
     <l n="13">Hers was the subtlest spell by far</l>
     <l n="14">Of all that sets young hearts romancing :</l>
     <l n="15">She was our queen , our rose , our star ;</l>
     <l n="16">And then she danced ,— oh , heaven , her dancing !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Dark was her hair , her hand was white ;</l>
     <l n="18">Her voice was exquisitely tender ;</l>
     <l n="19">Her eyes were full of liquid light ;</l>
     <l n="20">I never saw a waist so slender ;</l>
     <l n="21">Her every look , her every smile ,</l>
     <l n="22">Shot right and left a score of arrows ;</l>
     <l n="23">I thought ‘ twas Venus from her isle ,</l>
     <l n="24">And wondered where she 'd left her sparrows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">She talked of politics or prayers ,—</l>
     <l n="26">Of Southey 's prose , or Wordsworth 's sonnets ,</l>
     <l n="27">Of danglers or of dancing bears ,</l>
     <l n="28">Of battles , or the last new bonnets ;</l>
     <l n="29">By candle-light , at twelve o'clock ,</l>
     <l n="30">To me it mattered not a tittle ,</l>
     <l n="31">If those bright lips had quoted Locke ,</l>
     <l n="32">I might have thought they murmured Little .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Through sunny May , through sultry June ,</l>
     <l n="34">I loved her with a love eternal ;</l>
     <l n="35">I spoke her praises to the moon ,</l>
     <l n="36">I wrote them to the Sunday Journal .</l>
     <l n="37">My mother laughed ; I soon found out</l>
     <l n="38">That ancient ladies have no feeling :</l>
     <l n="39">My father frowned ; but how should gout</l>
     <l n="40">See any happiness in kneeling ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">She was the daughter of a dean ,</l>
     <l n="42">Rich , fat , and rather apoplectic ;</l>
     <l n="43">She had one brother just thirteen ,</l>
     <l n="44">Whose color was extremely hectic ;</l>
     <l n="45">Her grandmother , for many a year ,</l>
     <l n="46">Had fed the parish with her bounty ;</l>
     <l n="47">Her second cousin was a peer ,</l>
     <l n="48">And lord-lieutenant of the county .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">But titles and the three-per-cents ,</l>
     <l n="50">And mortgages , and great relations ,</l>
     <l n="51">And India bonds , and tithes and rents ,</l>
     <l n="52">Oh , what are they to love 's sensations ?</l>
     <l n="53">Black eyes , fair forehead , clustering locks ,—</l>
     <l n="54">Such wealth , such honors , Cupid chooses ;</l>
     <l n="55">He cares as little for the stocks ,</l>
     <l n="56">As Baron Rothschild for the Muses .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">She sketched ; the vale , the wood , the beach ,</l>
     <l n="58">Grew lovelier from her pencil 's shading ;</l>
     <l n="59">She botanized ; I envied each</l>
     <l n="60">Young blossom in her boudoir fading :</l>
     <l n="61">She warbled Handel ; it was grand ,—</l>
     <l n="62">She made the Catilina jealous ;</l>
     <l n="63">She touched the organ ; I could stand</l>
     <l n="64">For hours and hours to blow the bellows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">She kept an album , too , at home ,</l>
     <l n="66">Well filled with all an album 's glories ;</l>
     <l n="67">Paintings of butterflies and Rome ,</l>
     <l n="68">Patterns for trimmings , Persian stories ,</l>
     <l n="69">Soft songs to Julia 's cockatoo ,</l>
     <l n="70">Fierce odes to famine and to slaughter ,</l>
     <l n="71">And autographs of Prince Leboo ,</l>
     <l n="72">And recipes for elder-water .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">And she was flattered , worshipped , bored ;</l>
     <l n="74">Her steps were watched , her dress was noted ;</l>
     <l n="75">Her poodle-dog was quite adored ;</l>
     <l n="76">Her sayings were extremely quoted .</l>
     <l n="77">She laughed , and every heart was glad ,</l>
     <l n="78">As if the taxes were abolished ;</l>
     <l n="79">She frowned , and every took was sad ,</l>
     <l n="80">As if the opera were demolished .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="81">She smiled on many just for fun ,—</l>
     <l n="82">I knew that there was nothing in it ;</l>
     <l n="83">I was the first , the only one</l>
     <l n="84">Her heart had thought of for a minute .</l>
     <l n="85">I knew it , for she told me so ,</l>
     <l n="86">In phrase which was divinely moulded ;</l>
     <l n="87">She wrote a charming hand , and oh ,</l>
     <l n="88">How sweetly all her notes were folded !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="89">Our love was like most other loves ,—</l>
     <l n="90">A little glow , a little shiver ,</l>
     <l n="91">A rosebud and a pair of gloves ,</l>
     <l n="92">And “ Fly Not Yet , ” upon the river ;</l>
     <l n="93">Some jealousy of some one 's heir ,</l>
     <l n="94">Some hopes of dying broken-hearted ;</l>
     <l n="95">A miniature , a lock of hair ,</l>
     <l n="96">The usual vows ,— and then we parted .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="97">We parted : months and years rolled by ;</l>
     <l n="98">We met again four summers after .</l>
     <l n="99">Our parting was all sob and sigh ,—</l>
     <l n="100">Our meeting was all mirth and laughter ;</l>
     <l n="101">For , in my heart 's most secret cell ,</l>
     <l n="102">There had been many other lodgers ;</l>
     <l n="103">And she was not the ball-room 's belle ,</l>
     <l n="104">But only Mrs .— Something — Rogers .</l>

     <l n="21">When winter 's cold brought frost and snow ,</l>

     <l n="1">Fair cousin mine ! the golden days</l>
     <l n="2">Of old romance are over ;</l>

     <l n="13">Now wedlock is a sober thing —</l>

     <l n="17">Then every cross-bow had a string ,</l>

    <head>THE JOLLY OLD PEDAGOGUE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Twas a jolly old pedagogue , long ago ,</l>
     <l n="2">Tall and slender , and sallow and dry ;</l>
     <l n="3">His form was bent , and his gait was slow ,</l>
     <l n="4">His long , thin hair was as white as snow ,</l>
     <l n="5">But a wonderful twinkle shone in his eye ;</l>
     <l n="6">And he sang every night as he went to bed ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ Let us be happy down here below :</l>
     <l n="8">The living should live , though the dead be dead , ”</l>
     <l n="9">Said the jolly old pedagogue , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">He taught his scholars the rule of three ,</l>
     <l n="11">Writing , and reading , and history , too ;</l>
     <l n="12">He took the little ones up on his knee ,</l>
     <l n="13">For a kind old heart in his breast had he ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the wants of the littlest child he knew :</l>
     <l n="15">“ Learn while you 're young , ” he often said ,</l>
     <l n="16">“ There is much to enjoy , down here below ;</l>
     <l n="17">Life for the living , and rest for the dead ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">With the stupidest boys he was kind and cool ,</l>
     <l n="20">Speaking only in gentlest tones ;</l>
     <l n="21">The rod was hardly known in his school ...</l>
     <l n="22">Whipping , to him , was a barbarous rule ,</l>
     <l n="23">And too hard work for his poor old bones ;</l>
     <l n="24">Besides , it was painful , he sometimes said :</l>
     <l n="25">“ We should make life pleasant , down here below ,</l>
     <l n="26">The living need charity more than the dead , ”</l>
     <l n="27">Said the jolly old pedagogue , long ago .</l>

     <l n="28">He lived in the house by the hawthorn lane ,</l>
     <l n="29">With roses and woodbine over the door ;</l>
     <l n="30">His rooms were quiet , and neat , and plain ,</l>
     <l n="31">But a spirit of comfort there held reign ,</l>
     <l n="32">And made him forget he was old and poor ;</l>
     <l n="33">“ I need so little , ” he often said ;</l>
     <l n="34">“ And my friends and relatives here below</l>
     <l n="35">Wo n't litigate over me when I am dead , ”</l>
     <l n="36">Said the jolly old pedagogue , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">But the pleasantest times that he had , of all ,</l>
     <l n="38">Were the sociable hours he used to pass ,</l>
     <l n="39">With his chair tipped back to a neighbor 's wall ,</l>
     <l n="40">Making an unceremonious call ,</l>
     <l n="41">Over a pipe and a friendly glass :</l>
     <l n="42">This was the finest picture , he said ,</l>

     <l n="46">Then the jolly old pedagogue 's wrinkled face</l>
     <l n="47">Melted all over in sunshiny smiles ;</l>
     <l n="48">He stirred his glass with an old-school grace ,</l>
     <l n="49">Chuckled , and sipped , and prattled apace ,</l>
     <l n="50">Till the house grew merry , from cellar to tiles :</l>
     <l n="51">“ I 'm a pretty old man , ” he gently said ,</l>
     <l n="52">“ I 've lingered a long while , here below ;</l>
     <l n="53">But my heart is fresh , if my youth is fled ! ”</l>
     <l n="54">Said the jolly old pedagogue , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">He smoked his pipe in the balmy air ,</l>
     <l n="56">Every night when the sun went down ,</l>
     <l n="57">While the soft wind played in his silvery hair ,</l>
     <l n="58">Leaving its tenderest kisses there ,</l>
     <l n="59">On the jolly old pedagogue 's jolly old crown :</l>
     <l n="60">And , feeling the kisses , he smiled and said ,</l>
     <l n="61">‘ Twas a glorious world , down here below ;</l>
     <l n="62">“ Why wait for happiness till we are dead ? ”</l>
     <l n="63">Said the jolly old pedagogue , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">He sat at his door , one midsummer night ,</l>
     <l n="65">After the sun had sunk in the west ,</l>
     <l n="66">And the lingering beams of golden light</l>
     <l n="67">Made his kindly old face look warm and bright ,</l>
     <l n="68">While the odorous night-wind whispered “ Rest ! ”</l>
     <l n="69">Gently , gently , he bowed his head ....</l>
     <l n="70">There were angels waiting for him , I know ;</l>
     <l n="71">He was sure of happiness , living or dead ,</l>
     <l n="72">This jolly old pedagogue , long ago !</l>

   <p>THALIA A Middle-aged Lyrical Poet Is supposed To Be Taking Final Leave Of The Muse Of Comedy . She Has Brought Him His Hat And Gloves , And Is Abstractedly Picking A Thread Of Gold Hair From His Coat Sleeve As He Begins To Speak :</p>
   <p>I say it under the rose — oh , thanks !— yes , under the laurel , We part lovers , not foes ; we are not going to quarrel .</p>
   <p>We have too long been friends on foot and in gilded coaches , Now that the whole thing ends , to spoil our kiss with reproaches .</p>
   <p>I leave you ; my soul is wrung ; I pause , look back from the portal — Ah , I no more am young , and you , child , you are immortal !</p>
   <p>Mine is the glacier 's way , yours is the blossom 's weather — When were December and May known to be happy together ?</p>
   <p>Before my kisses grow tame , before my moodiness grieve you , While yet my heart is flame , and I all lover , I leave you .</p>
   <p>So , in the coming time , when you count the rich years over , Think of me in my prime , and not as a white-haired lover ,</p>
   <p>Fretful , pierced with regret , the wraith of a dead Desire Thrumming a cracked spinet by a slowly dying fire .</p>
   <p>When , at last , I am cold — years hence , if the gods so will it — Say , “ He was true as gold , ” and wear a rose in your fillet !</p>
   <p>Others , tender as I , will come and sue for caresses , Woo you , win you , and die — mind you , a rose in your tresses !</p>
   <p>Some Melpomene woo , some hold Clio the nearest ; You , sweet Comedy — you were ever sweetest and dearest !</p>
   <p>Nay , it is time to go . When writing your tragic sister Say to that child of woe how sorry I was I missed her .</p>
   <p>Really , I cannot stay , though “ parting is such sweet sorrow ” ... Perhaps I will , on my way down-town , look in to-morrow !</p>

     <l n="1">Friendship , like love , is but a name ,</l>
     <l n="2">Unless to one you stint the flame .</l>
     <l n="3">The child , whom many fathers share ,</l>
     <l n="4">Hath seldom known a father 's care .</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Tis thus in friendship ; who depend</l>
     <l n="6">On many , rarely find a friend .</l>
     <l n="7">A Hare , who , in a civil way ,</l>
     <l n="8">Complied with everything , like Gay ,</l>
     <l n="9">Was known by all the bestial train ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who haunt the wood , or graze the plain ;</l>
     <l n="11">Her care was never to offend ,</l>
     <l n="12">And every creature was her friend .</l>
     <l n="13">As forth she went at early dawn ,</l>
     <l n="14">To taste the dew-besprinkled lawn ,</l>
     <l n="15">Behind she hears the hunter 's cries ,</l>
     <l n="16">And from the deep-mouthed thunder flies :</l>
     <l n="17">She starts , she stops , she pants for breath ;</l>
     <l n="18">She hears the near advance of death ;</l>
     <l n="19">She doubles , to mislead the hound ,</l>
     <l n="20">And measures back her mazy round :</l>
     <l n="21">Till , fainting in the public way ,</l>
     <l n="22">Half dead with fear she gasping lay .</l>
     <l n="23">What transport in her bosom grew ,</l>
     <l n="24">When first the Horse appeared in view !</l>
     <l n="25">“ Let me , ” says she , “ your back ascend ,</l>
     <l n="26">And owe my safety to a friend .</l>
     <l n="27">You know my feet betray my flight :</l>
     <l n="28">To friendship every burden 's light . ”</l>
     <l n="29">The Horse replied : “ Poor honest Puss ,</l>
     <l n="30">It grieves my heart to see thee thus ;</l>
     <l n="31">Be comforted ; relief is near ,</l>
     <l n="32">For all your friends are in the rear . ”</l>
     <l n="33">She next the stately Bull implored ;</l>
     <l n="34">And thus replied the mighty lord :</l>
     <l n="35">“ Since every beast alive can tell</l>
     <l n="36">That I sincerely wish you well ,</l>
     <l n="37">I may , without offence , pretend ,</l>
     <l n="38">To take the freedom of a friend .</l>
     <l n="39">Love calls me hence ; a favorite cow</l>

     <l n="41">And when a lady 's in the case ,</l>
     <l n="42">You know , all other things give place .</l>
     <l n="43">To leave you thus might seem unkind ;</l>
     <l n="44">But see , the Goat is just behind . ”</l>
     <l n="45">The Goat remarked her pulse was high ,</l>
     <l n="46">Her languid head , her heavy eye ;</l>

     <l n="49">The Sheep was feeble , and complained</l>
     <l n="50">His sides a load of wool sustained :</l>
     <l n="51">Said he was slow , confessed his fears ,</l>
     <l n="52">For hounds eat sheep as well as Hares .</l>
     <l n="53">She now the trotting Calf addressed ,</l>

     <l n="1">When the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Eden 's green and gold ,</l>

   <p>CERTAIN MAXIMS OF HAFIZ</p>
   <p>I If It be pleasant to look on , stalled in the packed serai , Does not the Young Man try Its temper and pace ere he buy ? If She be pleasant to look on , what does the Young Man say ? “ Lo ! She is pleasant to look on , give Her to me today ! ”</p>
   <p>II Yea , though a Kaffir die , to him is remitted Jehannum If he borrowed in life from a native at sixty per cent per annum .</p>
   <p>III Blister we not for bursati ? So when the heart is vexed , The pain of one maiden 's refusal is drowned in the pain of the next .</p>
   <p>IV The temper of chums , the love of your wife , and a new piano 's tune — Which of the three will you trust at the end of an Indian June ?</p>
   <p>V Who are the rulers of Ind — to whom shall we bow the knee ? Make your peace with the women , and men will make you L. G .</p>
   <p>VI Does the woodpecker flit round the young ferash ? Does the grass clothe a new-built wall ? Is she under thirty , the woman who holds a boy in her thrall ?</p>
   <p>VI If She grow suddenly gracious — reflect . Is it all for thee ? The black-buck is stalked through the bullock , and Man through jealousy .</p>
   <p>VIII Seek not for favor of women . So shall you find it indeed . Does not the boar break cover just when you 're lighting a weed ?</p>
   <p>IX If He play , being young and unskilful , for shekels of silver and gold , Take His money , my son , praising Allah . The kid was ordained to be sold .</p>
   <p>X With a “ weed ” among men or horses verily this is the best , That you work him in office or dog-cart lightly — but give him no rest .</p>
   <p>XI Pleasant the snaffle of Courtship , improving the manners and carriage ; But the colt who is wise will abstain from the terrible thornbit of Marriage .</p>
   <p>XII As the thriftless gold of the babul , so is the gold that we spend On a Derby Sweep , or our neighbor 's wife , or the horse that we buy from a friend .</p>
   <p>XIII The ways of a man with a maid be strange , yet simple and tame To the ways of a man with a horse , when selling or racing that same .</p>
   <p>XIV In public Her face turneth to thee , and pleasant Her smile when ye meet . It is ill . The cold rocks of El-Gidar smile thus on the waves at their feet . In public Her face is averted , with anger She nameth thy name . It is well . Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game ?</p>
   <p>XV If She have spoken a word , remember thy lips are sealed , And the Brand of the Dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed . If She have written a letter , delay not an instant , but burn it . Tear it in pieces , O Fool , and the wind to her mate shall return it ! If there be trouble to Herward , and a lie of the blackest can clear , Lie , while thy lips can move or a man is alive to hear .</p>
   <p>XVI My Son , if a maiden deny thee and scufflingly bid thee give o'er , Yet lip meets with lip at the lastward — get out ! She has been there before . They are pecked on the ear and the chin and the nose who are lacking in lore .</p>
   <p>XVII If we fall in the race , though we win , the hoof-slide is scarred on the course . Though Allah and Earth pardon Sin , remaineth forever Remorse .</p>
   <p>XVIII “ By all I am misunderstood ! ” if the Matron shall say , or the Maid :— “ Alas ! I do not understand , ” my son , be thou nowise afraid . In vain in the sight of the Bird is the net of the Fowler displayed .</p>
   <p>XIX My Son , if I , Hafiz , thy father , take hold of thy knees in my pain , Demanding thy name on stamped paper , one day or one hour — refrain . Are the links of thy fetters so light that thou cravest another man 's chain ?</p>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT : To borrow Wordsworth 's name was wrong , Or slightly misapplied ; And so I 'd better call my song “ Lines after Ache-inside . ” Henry Sambrooke Leigh [ 1837-1883 ] LUCY LAKE After Wordsworth Poor Lucy Lake was overgrown , But somewhat underbrained . She did not know enough , I own , To go in when it rained . Yet Lucy was constrained to go ; Green bedding ,— you infer . Few people knew she died , but oh , The difference to her ! Newton Mackintosh [ 1858 - JANE SMITH After Wordsworth I journeyed , on a winter 's day , Across the lonely wold ; No bird did sing upon the spray , And it was very cold . I had a coach with horses four , Three white ( though one was black ) , And on they went the common o'er , Nor swiftness did they lack . A little girl ran by my side , And she was pinched and thin . “ Oh , please , sir , do give me a ride ! I 'm fetching mother 's gin . ” “ Enter my coach , sweet child , ” said I , “ For you shall ride with me ; And I will get you your supply Of mother 's eau-de-vie . ” The publican was stern and cold , And said : “ Her mother 's score Is writ , as you shall soon behold , Behind the bar-room door ! ” I blotted out the score with tears , And paid the money down ; And took the maid of thirteen years Back to her mother 's town . And though the past with surges wild Fond memories may sever , The vision of that happy child Will leave my spirits never ! Rudyard Kipling [ 1865-1936 ] FATHER WILLIAM From “ Alice in Wonderland ” After Southey “ You are old , Father William , ” the young man said , “ And your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your head — Do you think , at your age , it is right ? ” “ In my youth , ” Father William replied to his son , “ I feared it might injure the brain ; But , now that I 'm perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again . ” “ You are old , ” said the youth , “ as I mentioned before , And have grown most uncommonly fat ; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door — Pray , what is the reason of that ? ” “ In my youth , ” said the sage , as he shook his gray locks , “ I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment — one shilling the box — Allow me to sell you a couple ? ” “ You are old , ” said the youth , “ and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet ; Yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beak — Pray , how did you manage to do it ? ” “ In my youth , ” said his father , “ I took to the law , And argued each case with my wife ; And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw , Has lasted the rest of my life . ” “ You are old , ” said the youth , “ one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose — What made you so awfully clever ? ” “ I have answered three questions and that is enough , ” Said his father ; “ do n't give yourself airs ! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ? Be off , or I 'll kick you downstairs ! ” Lewis Carroll [ 1832-1898 ] THE NEW ARRIVAL After Campbell There came to port last Sunday night The queerest little craft , Without an inch of rigging on ; I looked and looked — and laughed ! It seemed so curious that she Should cross the Unknown water , And moor herself within my room — My daughter ! O , my daughter ! Yet by these presents witness all She 's welcome fifty times , And comes consigned in hope and love — And common-metre rhymes . She has no manifest but this ; No flag floats o'er the water ; She 's too new for the British Lloyds — My daughter ! O , my daughter ! Ring out , wild bells — and tame ones too ; Ring out the lover 's moon . Ring in the little worsted socks , Ring in the bib and spoon . Ring out the muse , ring in the nurse , Ring in the milk and water . Away with paper , pen , and ink — My daughter ! O , my daughter ! George Washington Cable [ 1844-1925 ] DISASTER After Moore ‘ Twas ever thus from childhood 's hour My fondest hopes would not decay : I never loved a tree or flower Which was the first to fade away ! The garden , where I used to delve Short-frocked , still yields me pinks in plenty ; The pear-tree that I climbed at twelve , I see still blossoming , at twenty . I never nursed a dear gazelle . But I was given a paroquet — How I did nurse him if unwell ! He 's imbecile , but lingers yet . He 's green , with an enchanting tuft ; He melts me with his small black eye : He 'd look inimitable stuffed , And knows it — but he will not die ! I had a kitten — I was rich In pets — but all too soon my kitten Became a full-sized cat , by which I 've more than once been scratched and bitten ; And when for sleep her limbs she curled One day beside her untouched plateful , And glided calmly from the world , I freely own that I was grateful . And then I bought a dog — a queen ! Ah , Tiny , dear departing pug ! She lives , but she is past sixteen , And scarce can crawl across the rug . I loved her beautiful and kind ; Delighted in her pert Bow-wow : But now she snaps if you do n't mind ; ‘ Twere lunacy to love her now . I used to think , should e'er mishap Betide my crumple-visaged Ti , In shape of prowling thief , or trap , Or coarse bull-terrier — I should die . But ah ! disasters have their use ; And life might e'en be too sunshiny : Nor would I make myself a goose , If some big dog should swallow Tiny . Charles Stuart Calverley [ 1831-1884 ] ‘ TWAS EVER THUS After Moore I never reared a young gazelle , ( Because , you see , I never tried ) ; But had it known and loved me well , No doubt the creature would have died . My rich and aged Uncle John Has known me long and loves me well But still persists in living on — I would he were a young gazelle . I never loved a tree or flower ; But , if I had , I beg to say The blight , the wind , the sun , or shower Would soon have withered it away . I 've dearly loved my Uncle John , From childhood to the present hour , And yet he will go living on — I would he were a tree or flower ! Henry Sambrooke Leigh [ 1837-1883 ] A GRIEVANCE After Byron Dear Mr. Editor : I wish to say — If you will not be angry at my , writing it — But I 've been used , since childhood 's happy day , When I have thought of something , to inditing it ; I seldom think of things ; and , by the way , Although this meter may not be exciting , it Enables one to be extremely terse , Which is not what one always is in verse . I used to know a man ,— such things befall The observant wayfarer through Fate 's domain — He was a man , take him for all in all , We shall not look upon his like again ; I know that statement 's not original ; What statement is , since Shakespeare ? or , since Cain , What murder ? I believe ‘ twas Shakespeare said it , or Perhaps it may have been your Fighting Editor . Though why an Editor should fight , or why A Fighter should abase himself to edit , Are problems far too difficult and high For me to solve with any sort of credit . Some greatly more accomplished man than I Must tackle them : let 's say then Shakespeare said it ; And , if he did not , Lewis Morris may ( Or even if he did ) . Some other day , When I have nothing pressing to impart , I should not mind dilating on this matter . I feel its import both in head and heart , And always did ,— especially the latter . I could discuss it in the busy mart Or on the lonely housetop ; hold ! this chatter Diverts me from my purpose . To the point : The time , as Hamlet said , is out of joint , And perhaps I was born to set it right ,— A fact I greet with perfect equanimity . I do not put it down to “ cursed spite , ” I do n't see any cause for cursing in it . I Have always taken very great delight In such pursuits since first I read divinity . Whoever will may write a nation 's songs As long as I 'm allowed to right its wrongs . What 's Eton but a nursery of wrong-righters , A mighty mother of effective men ; A training ground for amateur reciters , A sharpener of the sword as of the pen ; A factory of orators and fighters , A forcing-house of genius ? Now and then The world at large shrinks back , abashed and beaten , Unable to endure the glare of Eton . I think I said I knew a man : what then ? I do n't suppose such knowledge is forbid . We nearly all do , more or less , know men ,— Or think we do ; nor will a man get rid Of that delusion while he wields a pen . But who this man was , what , if aught , he did , Nor why I mentioned him , I do not know , Nor what I “ wished to say ” a while ago . James Kenneth Stephen [ 1859-1892 ] “ NOT A SOU HAD HE GOT ” After Charles Wolfe Not a sou had he got — not a guinea or note — And he looked confoundedly flurried , As he bolted away without paying his shot , And the landlady after him hurried . We saw him again at dead of night , When home from the club returning ; We twigged the doctor beneath the light Of the gas-lamp brilliantly burning . All bare and exposed to the midnight dews , Reclined in a gutter we found him ; And he looked like a gentleman taking a snooze With his Marshall cloak around him . “ The doctor 's as drunk as the devil , ” we said , And we managed a shutter to borrow ; We raised him ; and sighed at the thought that his head Would consumedly ache on the morrow . We bore him home , and we put him to bed , And we told his wife and his daughter To give him next morning a couple of red - Herrings , with soda-water . Loudly they talked of his money that 's gone , And his lady began to upbraid him ; But little he recked , so they let him snore on ‘ Neath the counterpane , just as we laid him . We tucked him in , and had hardly done , When , beneath the window calling , We heard the rough voice of a son of a gun Of a watchman “ One o'clock ! ” bawling . Slowly and sadly we all walked down From his room on the uppermost story ; A rushlight we placed on the cold hearth-stone , And we left him alone in his glory . Richard Harris Barham [ 1788-1845 ] THE WHITING AND THE SNAIL From “ Alice in Wonderland ” After Mary Howitt “ Will you walk a little faster ? ” said a whiting to a snail , “ There 's a porpoise close behind us , and he 's treading on my tail , See bow eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance ! They are waiting on the shingle — will you come and join the dance ? Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , will you join the dance ? Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , wo n't you join the dance ? “ You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! ” But the snail replied , “ Too far , too far ! ” and gave a look askance — Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance . Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance . Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance . “ What matters it how far we go ? ” his scaly friend replied . “ There is another shore , you know , upon the other side . The further off from England the nearer is to France — Then turn not pale , beloved snail , but come and join the dance . Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , will you join the dance ? Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , wo n't you join the dance ? ” Lewis Carroll [ 1832-1898 ] THE RECOGNITION After Tennyson Home they brought her sailor son , Grown a man across the sea , Tall and broad and black of beard , And hoarse of voice as man may be . Hand to shake and mouth to kiss , Both he offered ere he spoke ; But she said , “ What man is this Comes to play a sorry joke ? ” Then they praised him — called him “ smart , ” “ Tightest lad that ever stept ; ” But her son she did not know , And she neither smiled nor wept . Rose , a nurse of ninety years , Set a pigeon-pie in sight ; She saw him eat :— “ ‘ Tis he ! ‘ tis he ! ” She knew him — by his appetite ! Frederick William Sawyer [ 1810-1875 ] THE HIGHER PANTHEISM IN A NUTSHELL After Tennyson One , who is not , we see : but one , whom we see not , is ; Surely this is not that : but that is assuredly this . What , and wherefore , and whence ? for under is over and under ; If thunder could be without lightning , lightning could be without thunder . Doubt is faith in the main : but faith , on the whole , is doubt ; We cannot believe by proof : but could we believe without ? Why , and whither , and how ? for barley and rye are not clover ; Neither are straight lines curves : yet over is under and over . Two and two may be four : but four and four are not eight ; Fate and God may be twain : but God is the same thing as fate . Ask a man what he thinks , and get from a man what he feels ; God , once caught in the fact , shows you a fair pair of heels . Body and spirit are twins : God only knows which is which ; The soul squats down in the flesh , like a tinker drunk in a ditch . One and two are not one : but one and nothing is two ; Truth can hardly be false , if falsehood cannot be true . Once the mastodon was : pterodactyls were common as cocks ; Then the mammoth was God ; now is He a prize ox . Parallels all things are : yet many of these are askew . You are certainly I : but certainly I am not you . Springs the rock from the plain , shoots the stream from the rock ; Cocks exist for the hen : but hens exist for the cock . God , whom we see not , is : and God , who is not , we see ; Fiddle , we know , is diddle ; and diddle , we take it , is dee . Algernon Charles Swinburne [ 1837-1909 ] THE WILLOW-TREE After Hood Long by the willow-trees Vainly they sought her , Wild rang the mother 's screams O'er the gray water : “ Where is my lovely one ? Where is my daughter ? “ Rouse thee , Sir Constable — Rouse thee and look ; Fisherman , bring your net , Boatman , your hook . Beat in the lily-beds , Dive in the brook ! ” Vainly the constable Shouted and called her ; Vainly the fisherman Beat the green alder ; Vainly he flung the net , Never it hauled her ! Mother beside the fire Sat , her nightcap in ; Father , in easy chair , Gloomily napping , When at the window-sill Came a light tapping ! And a pale countenance Looked through the casement . Loud beat the mother 's heart , Sick with amazement , And at the vision which Came to surprise her , Shrieked in an agony — “ Lor ’ ! it 's Elizar ! ” Yes , ‘ twas Elizabeth — Yes , ‘ twas their girl ; Pale was her cheek , and her Hair out of curl . “ Mother , ” the loving one , Blushing exclaimed , “ Let not your innocent Lizzy be blamed . “ Yesterday , going to Aunt Jones 's to tea , Mother , dear mother , I Forgot the door-key ! And as the night was cold And the way steep , Mrs. Jones kept me to Breakfast and sleep . ” Whether her Pa and Ma Fully believed her , That we shall never know , Stern they received her ; And for the work of that Cruel , though short , night Sent her to bed without Tea for a fortnight . MORAL Hey diddle diddlety , Cat and the fiddlety , Maidens of England , take caution by she ! Let love and suicide Never tempt you aside , And always remember to take the door-key . William Makepeace Thackeray [ 1811-1863 ] POETS AND LINNETS After Robert Browning Where'er there 's a thistle to feed a linnet And linnets are plenty , thistles rife — Or an acorn-cup to catch dew-drops in it There 's ample promise of further life . Now , mark how we begin it . For linnets will follow , if linnets are minded , As blows the white-feather parachute ; And ships will reel by the tempest blinded — Aye , ships and shiploads of men to boot ! How deep whole fleets you 'll find hid . And we blow the thistle-down hither and thither Forgetful of linnets , and men , and God . The dew ! for its want an oak will wither — By the dull hoof into the dust is trod , And then who strikes the cither ? But thistles were only for donkeys intended , And that donkeys are common enough is clear , And that drop ! what a vessel it might have befriended , Does it add any flavor to Glugabib 's beer ? Well , there 's my musing ended . Tom Hood [ 1835-1874 ] THE JAM-POT The Jam-pot — tender thought ! I grabbed it — so did you . “ What wonder while we fought Together that it flew In shivers ? ” you retort . You should have loosed your hold One moment — checked your fist . But , as it was , too bold You grappled and you missed . More plainly — you were sold . “ Well , neither of us shared The dainty . ” That your plea ? “ Well , neither of us cared , ” I answer .... “ Let me see . How have your trousers fared ? ” Rudyard Kipling [ 1865-1936 ] BALLAD After William Morris Part I The auld wife sat at her ivied door , ( Butler and eggs and a pound of cheese ) A thing she had frequently done before ; And her spectacles lay on her aproned knees . The piper he piped on the hill-top high , ( Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ) Till the cow said “ I die , ” and the goose asked “ Why ? ” And the dog said nothing , but searched for fleas . The farmer he strode through the square farmyard ; ( Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ) His last brew of ale was a trifle hard — The connection of which with the plot one sees . The farmer 's daughter hath frank blue eyes ; ( Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ) She hears the rooks caw in the windy skies , As she sits at her lattice and shells her peas . The farmer 's daughter hath ripe red lips ; ( Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ) If you try to approach her , away she skips Over tables and chairs with apparent ease . The farmer 's daughter hath soft brown hair ; ( Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ) And I met with a ballad , I can n't say where , Which wholly consisted of lines like these . Part II She sat , with her hands ‘ neath her dimpled cheeks , ( Butler and eggs and a pound of cheese ) And spake not a word . While a lady speaks There is hope , but she did n't even sneeze . She sat , with her hands ‘ neath her crimson cheeks , ( Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ) She gave up mending her father 's breeks , And let the cat roll in her new chemise . She sat , with her hands ‘ neath her burning cheeks , ( Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ) And gazed at the piper for thirteen weeks ; Then she followed him out o'er the misty leas . Her sheep followed her , as their tails did them . ( Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ) And this song is considered a perfect gem , And as to the meaning , it 's what you please . Charles Stuart Calverley [ 1831-1884 ] THE POSTER-GIRL After Dante Gabriel Rossetti The blessed Poster-girl leaned out From a pinky-purple heaven ; One eye was red and one was green ; Her bang was cut uneven ; She had three fingers on her hand , And the hairs on her head were seven . Her robe , ungirt from clasp to hem , No sunflowers did adorn , But a heavy Turkish portiere Was very neatly worn ; And the hat that lay along her back Was yellow like canned corn . It was a kind of wobbly wave That she was standing on , And high aloft she flung a scarf That must have weighed a ton ; And she was rather tall — at least She reached up to the sun . She curved and writhed , and then she said , Less green of speech than blue : “ Perhaps I am absurd — perhaps I do n't appeal to you ; But my artistic worth depends Upon the point of view . ” I saw her smile , although her eyes Were only smudgy smears ; And then she swished her swirling arms , And wagged her gorgeous ears , She sobbed a blue-and-green-checked sob , And wept some purple tears . Carolyn Wells [ 186 ?— AFTER DILETTANTE CONCETTI After Dante Gabriel Rossetti “ Why do you wear your hair like a man , Sister Helen ? This week is the third since you began . ” “ I 'm writing a ballad ; be still if you can , Little brother . ( O Mother Carey , mother ! What chickens are these between sea and heaven ? ) ” “ But why does your figure appear so lean , Sister Helen ? And why do you dress in sage , sage green ? ” “ Children should never be heard , if seen , Little brother ! ( O Mother Carey , mother ! What fowls are a-wing in the stormy heaven ! ) ” “ But why is your face so yellowy white , Sister Helen ? And why are your skirts so funnily tight ? ” “ Be quiet , you torment , or how can I write , Little brother ? ( O Mother Carey , mother ! How gathers thy train to the sea from the heaven ! ) ” “ And who 's Mother Carey , and what is her train , Sister Helen ? And why do you call her again and again ? ” “ You troublesome boy , why that 's the refrain , Little brother . ( O Mother Carey , mother ! What work is toward in the startled heaven ? ) ” “ And what 's a refrain ? What a curious word , Sister Helen ! Is the ballad you 're writing about a sea-bird ? ” “ Not at all ; why should it be ? Do n't be absurd , Little brother . ( O Mother Carey , mother ! Thy brood flies lower as lowers the heaven . ) ” ( A big brother speaketh :) “ The refrain you 've studied a meaning had , Sister Helen ! It gave strange force to a weird ballad . But refrains have become a ridiculous ‘ fad ’ , Little brother . And Mother Carey , mother , Has a bearing on nothing in earth or heaven . “ But the finical fashion has had its day , Sister Helen . And let 's try in the style of a different lay To bid it adieu in poetical way , Little brother . So , Mother Carey , mother ! Collect your chickens and go to — heaven . ” ( A pause . Then the big brother singeth , accompanying himself in a plaintive wise on the triangle :) “ Look in my face . My name is Used-to-was , I am also called Played-out and Done-to-death , And It-will-wash-no-more . Awakeneth Slowly , but sure awakening it has , The common-sense of man ; and I , alas ! The ballad-burden trick , now known too well , Am turned to scorn , and grown contemptible — A too transparent artifice to pass . “ What a cheap dodge I am ! The cats who dart Tin-kettled through the streets in wild surprise Assail judicious ears not otherwise ; And yet no critics praise the urchin 's ‘ art ’ , Who to the wretched creature 's caudal part Its foolish empty-jingling ‘ burden ’ ties . ” Henry Duff Traill [ 1842-1900 ] IF After Swinburne If life were never bitter , And love were always sweet , Then who would care to borrow A moral from to-morrow — If Thames would always glitter , And joy would ne'er retreat , If life were never bitter , And love were always sweet ! If care were not the waiter Behind a fellow 's chair , When easy-going sinners Sit down to Richmond dinners , And life 's swift stream flows straighter , By Jove , it would be rare , If care were not the waiter Behind a fellow 's chair . If wit were always radiant , And wine were always iced , And bores were kicked out straightway Through a convenient gateway ; Then down the year 's long gradient ‘ Twere sad to be enticed , If wit were always radiant , And wine were always iced . Mortimer Collins [ 1827-1876 ] NEPHELIDIA After Swinburne From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn through a notable nimbus of nebulous noonshine , Pallid and pink as the palm of the flag-flower that flickers with fear of the flies as they float , Are the looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a marvel of mystic , miraculous moonshine , These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that thicken and threaten with throbs through the throat ? Thicken and thrill as a theatre thronged at appeal of an actor 's appalled agitation , Fainter with fear of the fires of the future than pale with the promise of pride in the past ; Flushed with the famishing fulness of fever that reddens with radiance of rathe recreation , Gaunt as the ghastliest of glimpses that gleam through the gloom of the gloaming when ghosts go aghast ? Nay , for the nick of the tick of the time is a tremulous touch on the temples of terror , Strained as the sinews yet strenuous with strife of the dead who is dumb as the dust-heaps of death ; Surely no soul is it , sweet as the spasm of erotic , emotional , exquisite error , Bathed in the balms of beatified bliss , beatific itself by beatitude 's breath . Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft to the spirit and soul of our senses Sweetens the stress of suspiring suspicion that sobs in the semblance and sound of a sigh ; Only this oracle opens Olympian in mystical moods and triangular tenses ,— “ Life is the lust of a lamp for the light that is dark till the dawn of the day when we die . ” Mild is the mirk and monotonous music of memory , melodiously mute as it may be , While the hope in the heart of a hero is bruised by the breach of men 's rapiers , resigned to the rod ; Made meek as a mother whose bosom-beats bound with the bliss-bringing bulk of a balm-breathing baby , As they grope through the graveyard of creeds under skies growing green at a groan for the grimness of God . Blank is the book of his bounty beholden of old , and its binding is blacker than bluer : Out of blue into black is the scheme of the skies , and their dews are the wine of the blood-shed of things ; Till the darkling desire of delight shall be free as a fawn that is freed from the fangs that pursue her , Till the heart-beats of hell shall be hushed by a hymn from the hunt that has harried the kennel of kings . Algernon Charles Swinburne [ 1837-1909 ] COMMONPLACES After Heine Rain on the face of the sea , Rain on the sodden land , And the window-pane is blurred with rain As I watch it , pen in hand . Mist on the face of the sea , Mist on the sodden land , Filling the vales as daylight fails , And blotting the desolate sand . Voices from out of the mist , Calling to one another : “ Hath love an end , thou more than friend , Thou dearer than ever brother ? ” Voices from out of the mist , Calling and passing away ; But I cannot speak , for my voice is weak , And .... this is the end of my lay . Rudyard Kipling [ 1865-1936 ] THE PROMISSORY NOTE After Poe In the lonesome latter years ( Fatal years ! ) To the dropping of my tears Danced the mad and mystic spheres In a rounded , reeling rune , ‘ Neath the moon , To the dripping and the dropping of my tears . Ah , my soul is swathed in gloom , ( Ulalume ! ) In a dim Titanic tomb , For my gaunt and gloomy soul Ponders o'er the penal scroll , O'er the parchment ( not a rhyme ) , Out of place ,— out of time ,— I am shredded , shorn , unshifty , ( Oh , the fifty ! ) And the days have passed , the three , Over me ! And the debit and the credit are as one to him and me ! ‘ Twas the random runes I wrote At the bottom of the note , ( Wrote and freely Gave to Greeley ) In the middle of the night , In the mellow , moonless night , When the stars were out of sight , When my pulses , like a knell , ( Israfel ! ) Danced with dim and dying fays , O'er the ruins of my days , O'er the dimeless , timeless days , When the fifty , drawn at thirty , Seeming thrifty , yet the dirty Lucre of the market , was the most that I could raise ! Fiends controlled it , ( Let him hold it ! ) Devils held me for the inkstand and the pen ; Now the days of grace are o'er , ( Ah , Lenore ! ) I am but as other men ; What is time , time , time , To my rare and runic rhyme , To my random , reeling rhyme , By the sands along the shore , Where the tempest whispers , “ Pay him ! ” and I answer , “ Nevermore ! ” Bayard Taylor [ 1825-1878 ] MRS. JUDGE JENKINS Being The Only Genuine Sequel To “ Maud Muller ” After Whittier Maud Muller all that summer day Raked the meadow sweet with hay ; Yet , looking down the distant lane , She hoped the Judge would come again . But when he came , with smile and bow , Maud only blushed , and stammered , “ Ha-ow ? ” And spoke of her “ pa , ” and wondered whether He 'd give consent they should wed together . Old Muller burst in tears , and then Begged that the Judge would lend him “ ten ” ; For trade was dull and wages low , And the “ craps , ” this year , were somewhat slow . And ere the languid summer died , Sweet Maud became the Judge 's bride . But on the day that they were mated , Maud 's brother Bob was intoxicated ; And Maud 's relations , twelve in all , Were very drunk at the Judge 's hall ; And when the summer came again , The young bride bore him babies twain ; And the Judge was blest , but thought it strange That bearing children made such a change . For Maud grew broad , and red , and stout , And the waist that his arm once clasped about Was more than he now could span ; and he Sighed as he pondered , ruefully , How that which in Maud was native grace In Mrs. Jenkins was out of place ; And thought of the twins , and wished that they Looked less like the men who raked the hay On Muller 's farm , and dreamed with pain Of the day he wandered down the lane . And , looking down that dreary track , He half regretted that he came back . For , had he waited , he might have wed Some maiden fair and thoroughbred ; For there be women as fair as she , Whose verbs and nouns do more agree . Alas for maiden ! alas for judge ! And the sentimental ,— that 's one-half “ fudge ” ; For Maud soon thought the Judge a bore , With all his learning and all his lore ; And the Judge would have bartered Maud 's fair face For more refinement and social grace . If , of all words of tongue and pen , The saddest are , “ It might have been , ” More sad are these we daily see : “ It is , but had n't ought to be . ” Bret Harte [ 1839-1902 ] THE MODERN HIAWATHA From “ The Song of Milkanwatha ” He killed the noble Mudjokivis , With the skin he made him mittens , Made them with the fur side inside , Made them with the skin side outside , He , to get the warm side inside , Put the inside skin side outside : He , to get the cold side outside , Put the warm side fur side inside : That 's why he put the fur side inside , Why he put the skin side outside , Why he turned them inside outside . George A . Strong [ 1832-1912 ] HOW OFTEN After Longfellow They stood on the bridge at midnight , In a park not far from the town ; They stood on the bridge at midnight , Because they did n't sit down . The moon rose o'er the city , Behind the dark church spire ; The moon rose o'er the city , And kept on rising higher . How often , oh ! how often They whispered words so soft ; How often , oh ! how often , How often , oh ! how oft . Ben King [ 1857-1894 ] “ IF I SHOULD DIE TO-NIGHT ” After Arabella Eugenia Smith If I should die to-night And you should come to my cold corpse and say , Weeping and heartsick o'er my lifeless clay — If I should die to-night , And you should come in deepest grief and woe — And say : “ Here 's that ten dollars that I owe , ” I might arise in my large white cravat And say , “ What 's that ? ” If I should die to-night And you should come to my cold corpse and , kneel , Clasping my bier to show the grief you feel , I say , if I should die to-night And you should come to me , and there and then Just even hint at paying me that ten , I might arise the while , But I 'd drop dead again . Ben King [ 1857-1894 ] SINCERE FLATTERY Of W. W. ( Americanus ) The clear cool note of the cuckoo which has ousted the legitimate nest-holder , The whistle of the railway guard dispatching the train to the inevitable collision , The maiden 's monosyllabic reply to a polysyllabic proposal , The fundamental note of the last trump , which is presumably D natural ; All of these are sounds to rejoice in , yea , to let your very ribs re-echo with : But better than all of them is the absolutely last chord of the apparently inexhaustible pianoforte player .

I kissed her — I did so ! And her and me Was pals . And if that ai n't good business , “ O crikey , Bill ! ” II . VILLANELLE Now ai n't they utterly too-too ( She ses , my Missus mine , ses she ) , Them flymy little bits of Blue . Joe , just you kool ‘ em — nice and skew Upon our old meogginee , Now ai n't they utterly too-too ?

William Ernest Henley [ 1849-1903 ] THE POETS AT TEA I .— ( Macaulay ) Pour , varlet , pour the water , The water steaming hot ! A spoonful for each man of us , Another for the pot ! We shall not drink from amber , No Capuan slave shall mix For us the snows of Athos With port at thirty-six ; Whiter than snow the crystals Grown sweet ‘ neath tropic fires , More rich the herb of China 's field , The pasture-lands more fragrance yield ; Forever let Britannia wield The teapot of her sires ! II .— ( Tennyson ) I think that I am drawing to an end : For on a sudden came a gasp for breath , And stretching of the hands , and blinded eyes , And a , great darkness falling on my soul . O Hallelujah !... Kindly pass the milk . III .— ( Swinburne ) As the sin that was sweet in the sinning Is foul in the ending thereof , As the heat of the summer 's beginning Is past in the winter of love : O purity , painful and pleading ! O coldness , ineffably gray ! O hear us , our handmaid unheeding , And take it away ! IV .— ( Cowper ) The cosy fire is bright and gay , The merry kettle boils away And hums a cheerful song . I sing the saucer and the cup ; Pray , Mary , fill the teapot up , And do not make it strong . V .— ( Browning ) Tut ! Bah ! We take as another case — Pass the pills on the window-sill ; notice the capsule ( A sick man 's fancy , no doubt , but I place Reliance on trade-marks , Sir ) — so perhaps you 'll Excuse the digression — this cup which I hold Light-poised — Bah , it 's spilt in the bed — well , let 's on go — Hold Bohea and sugar , Sir ; if you were told The sugar was salt , would the Bohea be Congo ? VI .— ( Wordsworth ) “ Come , little cottage girl , you seem To want my cup of tea ; And will you take a little cream ? Now tell the truth to me . ” She had a rustic , woodland grin , Her cheek was soft as silk , And she replied , “ Sir , please put in A little drop of milk . ” “ Why , what put milk into your head ? ‘ Tis cream my cows supply ; ” And five times to the child I said , “ Why , pig-head , tell me , why ? ” “ You call me pig-head , ” she replied ; “ My proper name is Ruth . I called that milk ” — she blushed with pride — “ You bade me speak the truth . ” VII .— ( Poe ) Here 's a mellow cup of tea — golden tea ! What a world of rapturous thought its fragrance brings to me ! Oh , from out the silver cells How it wells ! How it smells ! Keeping tune , tune , tune , To the tintinnabulation of the spoon . And the kettle on the fire Boils its spout off with desire , With a desperate desire And a crystalline endeavor Now , now to sit , or never , On the top of the pale-faced moon , But he always came home to tea , tea , tea , tea , tea , Tea to the n-th . VIII .— ( Rossetti ) The lilies lie in my lady 's bower , ( O weary mother , drive the cows to roost ) , They faintly droop for a little hour ; My lady 's head droops like a flower . She took the porcelain in her hand ( O weary mother , drive the cows to roost ) ; She poured ; I drank at her command ; Drank deep , and now — you understand ! ( O weary mother , drive the cows to roost ) . IX .— ( Burns ) Weel , gin ye speir , I 'm no inclined , Whusky or tay — to state my mind Fore ane or ither ; For , gin I tak the first , I 'm fou , And gin the next , I 'm dull as you : Mix a ’ thegither . X .— ( Walt Whitman ) One cup for my self-hood , Many for you . Allons , camerados , we will drink together , O hand-in-hand ! That tea-spoon , please , when you 've done with it . What butter-colored hair you 've got . I do n't want to be personal . All right , then , you need n't . You 're a stale-cadaver . Eighteen-pence if the bottles are returned . Allons , from all bat-eyed formulas . Barry Pain [ 1864-1928 ] WORDSWORTH Two voices are there : one is of the deep ; It learns the storm cloud 's thunderous melody , Now roars , now murmurs with the changing sea , Now birdlike pipes , now closes soft in sleep ; And one is of an old half-witted sheep Which bleats articulate monotony , And indicates that two and one are three , That grass is green , lakes damp , and mountains steep : And , Wordsworth , both are thine : at certain times , Forth from the heart of thy melodious rhymes The form and pressure of high thoughts will burst ; At other times-good Lord ! I 'd rather be Quite unacquainted with the A , B , C , Than write such hopeless rubbish as thy worst . James Kenneth Stephen [ 1859-1892 ]</p>
