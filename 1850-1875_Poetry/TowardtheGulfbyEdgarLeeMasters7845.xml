    <docImprint>It would have been fitting had I dedicated Spoon River Anthology to you . Considerations of an intimate nature , not to mention a literary encouragement which was before yours , crowded you from the page . Yet you know that it was you who pressed upon my attention in June ,<date>1909</date>, the Greek Anthology . It was from contemplation of its epitaphs that my hand unconsciously strayed to the sketches of “ Hod Putt , ” “ Serepta The Scold ” ( “ Serepta Mason ” in the book ) , “ Amanda Barker ” ( “ Amanda ” in the book ) , “ Ollie McGee ” and “ The Unknown , ” the first written and the first printed sketches of The Spoon River Anthology . The Mirror of May 29th ,<date>1914</date>, is their record . I take one of the epigrams of Meleager with its sad revealment and touch of irony and turn it from its prose form to a verse form , making verses according to the breath pauses : “ The holy night and thou , O Lamp , we took as witness of our vows ; and before thee we swore , he that would love me always and I that I would never leave him . We swore , and thou wert witness of our double promise . But now he says that our vows were written on the running waters . And thou , O Lamp , thou seest him in the arms of another . ” In verse this epigram is as follows : The holy night and thou , O Lamp , We took as witness of our vows ; And before thee we swore , He that would love me always And I that I would never leave him . We swore , And thou wert witness of our double promise . But now he says that our vows were written on the running waters . And thou , O Lamp , Thou seest him in the arms of another . It will be observed that iambic feet prevail in this translation . They merely become noticeable and imperative when arranged in verses . But so it is , even in the briefest and starkest rendering of these epigrams from the Greek the humanism and dignity of the original transfer themselves , making something , if less than verse , yet more than prose ; as Byron said of Sheridan 's speeches , neither poetry nor oratory , but better than either . It was no difficult matter to pass from Chase Henry :</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ In life I was the town drunkard . When I died the priest denied me burial In holy ground , etc . ” to the use of standard measures , or rhythmical arrangements of iambics or what not , and so to make a book , which for the first third required a practiced voice or eye to yield the semblance of verse ; and for the last two-thirds , or nearly so , accommodated itself to the less sensitive conception of the average reader . The prosody was allowed to take care of itself under the emotional requirements and inspiration of the moment . But there is nothing new in English literature for some hundreds of years in combinations of dactyls , anapests or trochees , and without rhyme . Nor did I discover to the world that an iambic pentameter can be lopped to a tetrameter without the verse ceasing to be an iambic ; though it be no longer the blank verse which has so ennobled English poetry . A great deal of unrhymed poetry is yet to be written in the various standard rhythms and in carefully fashioned metres . But obviously a formal resuscitation of the Greek epigrams , ironical and tender , satirical and sympathetic , as casual experiments in unrelated themes would scarcely make the same appeal that an epic rendition of modern life would do , and as it turned out actually achieved .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>The response of the American press to Spoon River Anthology during the summer of<date>1914</date>while it was appearing in the Mirror is my warrant for saying this . It was quoted and parodied during that time in the country and in the metropolitan newspapers . Current Opinion in its issue of September ,<date>1914</date>, reproduced from the Mirror some of the poems . Though at this time the schematic effect of the Anthology could not be measured , Edward J. Wheeler , that devoted patron of the art and discriminating critic of its manifestations , was attracted , I venture to say , by the substance of “ Griffy , The Cooper , ” for that is one of the poems from the Anthology which he set forth in his column “ The Voice of Living Poets ” in the issue referred to . Poetry , A Magazine of Verse , followed in its issue of October ,<date>1914</date>, with a reprinting from the Mirror . In a word , the Anthology went the rounds over the country before it was issued in book form . And a reception was thus prepared for the complete work not often falling to the lot of a literary production . I must not omit an expression of my gratitude for the very high praise which John Cowper Powys bestowed on the Anthology just before it appeared in book form and the publicity which was given his lecture by the<settlement>New York</settlement>Times . Nathan Haskell Dole printed an article in the<settlement>Boston</settlement>Transcript of June 30 ,<date>1915</date>, in which he contrasted the work with the Greek Anthology , pointing in particular to certain epitaphs by Carphylides , Kallaischros and Pollianos . The critical testimony of Miss Harriet Monroe in her editorial comments and in her preface to “ The New Poetry ” has greatly strengthened the judgment of to-day against a reversal at the hands of a later criticism . This response to the Anthology while it was appearing in the Mirror and afterwards when put in the book was to nothing so much as to the substance . It was accepted as a picture of our life in<country>America</country>. It was interpreted as a transcript of the state of mind of men and women here and elsewhere . You called it a Comedy Humaine in your announcement of my identity as the author in the Mirror of November 20 ,<date>1914</date>. If the epitaphic form gave added novelty I must confess that the idea was suggested to me by the Greek Anthology . But it was rather because of the Greek Anthology than from it that I evolved the less harmonious epitaphs with which Spoon River Anthology was commenced . As to metrical epitaphs it is needless to say that I drew upon the legitimate materials of authentic English versification . Up to the Spring of<date>1914</date>, I had never allowed a Spring to pass without reading Homer ; and I feel that this familiarity had its influence both as to form and spirit ; but I shall not take the space now to pursue this line of confessional . What is the substance of which I have spoken if it be not the life around us as we view it through eyes whose vision lies in heredity , mode of life , understanding of ourselves and of our place and time ? You have lived much . As a critic and a student of the country no one understands<country>America</country>better than you do . As a denizen of the west , but as a surveyor of the east and west you have brought to the country 's interpretation a knowledge of its political and literary life as well as a proficiency in the history of other lands and other times . You have seen and watched the unfolding of forces that sprang up after the Civil War . Those forces mounted in the eighties and exploded in free silver in<date>1896</date>. They began to hit through the directed marksmanship of Theodore Roosevelt during his second term . You knew at first hand all that went with these forces of human hope , futile or valiant endeavor , articulate or inarticulate expression of the new birth . You saw and lived , but in greater degree , what I have seen and lived . And with this back-ground you inspired and instructed me in my analysis . Standing by you confirmed or corrected my sculpturing of the clay taken out of the soil from which we both came . You did this with an eye familiar with the secrets of the last twenty years , familiar also with the relation of those years to the time which preceded and bore them . So it is , that not only because I could not dedicate Spoon River to you , but for the larger reasons indicated , am I impelled to do you whatever honor there may be in taking your name for this book . By this outline confession , sometime perhaps to be filled in , do I make known what your relation is to these interpretations of mine resulting from a spirit , life , thought , environment which have similarly come to us and have similarly affected us . I call this book “ Toward the Gulf , ” a title importing a continuation of the attempts of Spoon River and The Great Valley to mirror the age and the country in which we live . It does not matter which one of these books carries your name and makes these acknowledgments ; so far , anyway , as the opportunity is concerned for expressing my appreciation of your friendship and the great esteem and affectionate interest in which I hold you .</docImprint>

       <l n="357">That it is not worth living , snap , the bag</l>
       <l n="358">Would fly back for another punch . For life</l>
       <l n="359">Just like a punching bag will stand your whacks</l>
       <l n="360">Of hatred and denial , let you punch</l>
       <l n="361">Almost at will . But sometime , like the bag ,</l>

       <l n="372">And so his color fades , it well may be</l>
       <l n="373">The crisis of a long neurosis , well</l>
       <l n="374">What caused it ? But his eyes are wondrous clear</l>

       <l n="376">He takes his seat , admiring friends swarm round him ,</l>
       <l n="377">Conduct him to a carriage , he goes home</l>
       <l n="378">And sitting by the fire ( O what is fire ?</l>
       <l n="379">The miracle of fire dawns on his thought ,</l>
       <l n="380">Fire has been near him all these years unseen ,</l>
       <l n="381">How wonderful is fire ! ) which warms and soothes</l>
       <l n="382">Neuritic pains , he takes the rubber case</l>

       <l n="384">And as he stares upon the oval brow ,</l>
       <l n="385">The eyes of blue which flash the light of faith ,</l>
       <l n="386">Preserved like dendrites in this silver shimmer ,</l>
       <l n="387">Some spectral speculations fill his brain ,</l>
       <l n="388">Float like a storm above the sorry wreck</l>
       <l n="389">Of all his logic tools , machines ; for now</l>
       <l n="390">Since pains in back and shoulder like to father 's</l>
       <l n="391">Fall to him at the age that father had them ,</l>
       <l n="392">Father has entered him , has settled down</l>
       <l n="393">To live with him with those neuritic pangs .</l>
       <l n="394">Thus are his speculations . Over all</l>
       <l n="395">How comes it that a sudden feel of life ,</l>
       <l n="396">Its wonder , terror , beauty is like father 's ?</l>
       <l n="397">As if the soul of father entered in him</l>
       <l n="398">And made the field of consciousness his own ,</l>
       <l n="399">Emotions , powers of thought his instruments .</l>
       <l n="400">That is a horrible atavism , when</l>
       <l n="401">You find yourself reverting to a soul</l>
       <l n="402">You have not loved , despite yourself becoming</l>
       <l n="403">That other soul , and with an out-worn self</l>
       <l n="404">Crying for burial on your hands , a life</l>
       <l n="405">Not yours till now that waits your new found powers —</l>
       <l n="406">Live now or die indeed !</l>

       <l n="4">No meal has been prepared , where have you been ?</l>
       <l n="5">Toward sun 's decline we see you down the path ,</l>

       <l n="10">That Johnny Appleseed came here , planted some orchards around here ,</l>
       <l n="11">When nothing was here but the pine trees , oaks and the beeches ,</l>
       <l n="12">And nothing was here but the marshes , lake and the river .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Peter Van Zylen is ninety and this he tells me :</l>
       <l n="14">My father talked with Johnny Appleseed there on the hill-side ,</l>
       <l n="15">There by the road on the way to Fruitport , saw him</l>
       <l n="16">Clearing pines and oaks for a place for an apple orchard .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Peter Van Zylen says : He got that name from the people</l>
       <l n="18">For carrying apple-seed with him and planting orchards</l>
       <l n="19">All the way from Ohio , through Indiana across here ,</l>
       <l n="20">Planting orchards , they say , as far as Illinois .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Johnny Appleseed said , so my father told me :</l>
       <l n="22">I go to a place forgotten , the orchards will thrive and be here</l>
       <l n="23">For children to come , who will gather and eat hereafter .</l>
       <l n="24">And few will know who planted , and none will understand .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">I laugh , said Johnny Appleseed : Some fellow buys this timber</l>
       <l n="26">Five years , perhaps from to-day , begins to clear for barley .</l>
       <l n="27">And here in the midst of the timber is hidden an apple orchard .</l>
       <l n="28">How did it come here ? Lord ! Who was it here before me ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">Yes , I was here before him , to make these places of worship ,</l>
       <l n="30">Labor and laughter and gain in the late October .</l>
       <l n="31">Why did I do it , eh ? Some folks say I am crazy .</l>
       <l n="32">Where do my labors end ? Far west , God only knows !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Said Johnny Appleseed there on the hill-side : Listen !</l>
       <l n="34">Beware the deceit of nurseries , sellers of seeds of the apple .</l>
       <l n="35">Think ! You labor for years in trees not worth the raising .</l>
       <l n="36">You planted what you knew not , bitter or sour for sweet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">No luck more bitter than poor seed , but one as bitter :</l>
       <l n="38">The planting of perfect seed in soil that feeds and fails ,</l>
       <l n="39">Nourishes for a little , and then goes spent forever .</l>
       <l n="40">Look to your seed , he said , and remember the soil .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">And after that is the fight : the foe curled up at the root ,</l>
       <l n="42">The scale that crumples and deadens , the moth in the blossoms</l>
       <l n="43">Becoming a life that coils at the core of a thing of beauty :</l>
       <l n="44">You bite your apple , a worm is crushed on your tongue !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">And it 's every bit the truth , said Peter Van Zylen .</l>
       <l n="46">So many things love an apple as well as ourselves .</l>
       <l n="47">A man must fight for the thing he loves , to possess it :</l>
       <l n="48">Apples , freedom , heaven , said Peter Van Zylen .</l>

       <l n="1">My brother , the god , and I grow sick</l>

       <l n="8">To the shuttle 's play ;</l>
       <l n="9">Who grows the wool , who cards and spins ,</l>

       <l n="11">For the storied weave of the Gobelins ,</l>

       <l n="13">But whether you stand or walk around</l>

       <l n="17">No Hand is seen , but still you may feel</l>
       <l n="18">A pulse in the thread ,</l>
       <l n="19">And thought in every lever and wheel</l>
       <l n="20">Where the shuttle sped ,</l>
       <l n="21">Dripping the colors , as crushed and urged —</l>
       <l n="22">Is it cochineal ?—</l>
       <l n="23">Shot from the shuttle , woven and merged</l>
       <l n="24">A tale to reveal .</l>
       <l n="25">Woven and wound in a bolt and dried</l>
       <l n="26">As it were a plan .</l>
       <l n="27">Closer I looked at the thread and cried</l>

       <l n="29">Then my brother curious , strong and bold ,</l>

       <l n="32">The cryptic cloth .</l>
       <l n="33">He gasped for labor , blind for the moult</l>

       <l n="56">The dream of the dome ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="59">And here was the Persian , Jew and Goth</l>

       <l n="62">Angel and elf .</l>

       <l n="66">In the finished stuff ,</l>
       <l n="67">Where the knotted thread was proud and rebelled</l>
       <l n="68">As the shuttle proved</l>
       <l n="69">The fated warp and woof that held</l>
       <l n="70">When the shuttle moved ;</l>
       <l n="71">And pressed the dye which ran to loss</l>
       <l n="72">In a deep maroon</l>
       <l n="73">Around an altar , oracle , cross</l>
       <l n="74">Or a crescent moon .</l>
       <l n="75">Around a face , a thought , a star</l>

       <l n="80">Be woven and hushed ;</l>
       <l n="81">The Loom has a tale , you can see , to tell ,</l>

     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>JACK</head>
       <l n="1">The same as you :</l>
       <l n="2">You ran away from school . It was romance .</l>
       <l n="3">You thought you loved this flashy travelling man .</l>
       <l n="4">And I — I loved adventure , loved the truth .</l>
       <l n="5">I wanted to destroy the force called “ They . ”</l>
       <l n="6">There is no “ They ” — we 're all together here ,</l>
       <l n="7">And everyone must live , Christ Perko too ,</l>
       <l n="8">The pulp-mill , the policeman , magistrate ,</l>
       <l n="9">The alderman , the precinct captain too ,</l>
       <l n="10">And you the girls , myself the editor ,</l>
       <l n="11">And all the lesser writers . Here we are</l>
       <l n="12">Thrown in one integrated lot . You see</l>
       <l n="13">There is no “ They , ” except the terms , the thought</l>
       <l n="14">Which ramifies and vivifies the whole . ...</l>
       <l n="15">So I came to the city , went to work</l>
       <l n="16">Reporting for a paper . Having said</l>
       <l n="17">There is no “ They ” — I 've freed myself to say</l>
       <l n="18">What bitter things I choose . For how they drive you ,</l>
       <l n="19">And terrify you , mock you , ridicule you ,</l>
       <l n="20">And call you cub and greenhorn , send you round</l>
       <l n="21">To courts and dirty places , make you risk</l>
       <l n="22">Your body and your life , and make you watch</l>
       <l n="23">The rules about your writing ; what 's tabooed ,</l>
       <l n="24">What names are to be cursed or to be praised ,</l>
       <l n="25">What interests , policies to be subserved ,</l>
       <l n="26">And what to undermine . So I went through ,</l>
       <l n="27">Until I had a desk , wrote editorials —</l>
       <l n="28">Now said I to myself , I 'm free at last .</l>
       <l n="29">But no , my manager , your madam , mark you ,</l>
       <l n="30">Kept eye on me , for he was under watch</l>
       <l n="31">Of some Christ Perko . So my manager</l>
       <l n="32">Blue penciled me when I touched certain subjects .</l>
       <l n="33">But , as he was a just man , loved me too .</l>
       <l n="34">He gave me things to write where he could let</l>
       <l n="35">My conscience have full scope , as you might live</l>
       <l n="36">In this house where you saw the man you loved ,</l>
       <l n="37">And no one else , though living in this hell .</l>
       <l n="38">For I lived in a hell , who saw around me</l>
       <l n="39">Such lying , hatred , malice , prostitution .</l>
       <l n="40">And when this offer came to be an editor</l>
       <l n="41">Of a great magazine , I seemed to feel</l>
       <l n="42">My courage and my virtue given reward .</l>
       <l n="43">Now , I should pass on poems , and on stories ,</l>
       <l n="44">Creations of free souls . It was not so .</l>
       <l n="45">The poems and the stories one could see</l>
       <l n="46">Were written to be sold , to please a taste ,</l>
       <l n="47">Placate a prejudice , keep still alive</l>
       <l n="48">An era dying , ready for the tomb ,</l>
       <l n="49">Already smelling . And that was not all .</l>
       <l n="50">Just as the madam here must make report</l>
       <l n="51">To Perko , so the magazine had to run</l>
       <l n="52">To suit the pulp mill . As the madam here ,</l>
       <l n="53">Assistant to Christ Perko , must keep friends</l>
       <l n="54">With alderman , policemen , magistrates ,</l>
       <l n="55">So I was just a wheel in a machine</l>
       <l n="56">To keep it running with such larger wheels ,</l>
       <l n="57">And by them run , of policies , and politics</l>
       <l n="58">Of State and Nation . Here was I locked in</l>
       <l n="59">And given dope to keep me still lest I</l>
       <l n="60">Cry out and wake the copper-who 's the copper</l>
       <l n="61">For such as I was ? If he heard me cry</l>
       <l n="62">How could he raid the magazine ? If he raided</l>
       <l n="63">Where was the court to take me and the rest —</l>
       <l n="64">That 's it , where is the court ?</l>

      <head>SIR GALAHAD</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I met Hosea Job on Randolph Street</l>
       <l n="2">Who said to me : “ I 'm going for the train ,</l>
       <l n="3">I want you with me . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">And it happened then</l>
       <l n="5">My mind was hard , as muscles of the back</l>
       <l n="6">Grow hard resisting cold or shock or strain</l>
       <l n="7">And need the osteopath to be made supple ,</l>
       <l n="8">To give the nerves and streams of life a chance .</l>
       <l n="9">Hosea Job was just the osteopath</l>
       <l n="10">To loose , relax my mood . And so I said</l>
       <l n="11">“ All right ” — and went .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="12">Hosea was a man</l>
       <l n="13">Whom nothing touched of danger , or of harm .</l>
       <l n="14">His life was just a rare-bit dream , where some one</l>
       <l n="15">Seems like to fall before a truck or train —</l>
       <l n="16">Instead he walks across them . Or you see</l>
       <l n="17">Shadows of falling things , great buildings topple ,</l>
       <l n="18">Pianos skid like bulls from hellish corners</l>
       <l n="19">And chase the oblivious fool who stands and smiles .</l>
       <l n="20">The buildings slant and sway like monstrous searchlights ,</l>
       <l n="21">But never touch him . And the mad piano</l>
       <l n="22">Comes up to him , puts down its angry head ,</l>
       <l n="23">Runs out a friendly tongue and licks his hand ,</l>
       <l n="24">And lows a symphony .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">By which I mean</l>
       <l n="26">Hosea had some money , and would sign</l>
       <l n="27">A bond or note for any man who asked him .</l>
       <l n="28">He 'd rent a house and leave it , rent another ,</l>
       <l n="29">Then rent a farm , move out from town and in .</l>
       <l n="30">He 'd have the leases of superfluous places</l>
       <l n="31">Cancelled some how , was never sued for rent .</l>
       <l n="32">One time he had a fancy he would see</l>
       <l n="33">South Africa , took ship with a load of mules ,</l>
       <l n="34">First telegraphing home from New Orleans</l>
       <l n="35">He 'd be back in the Spring . Likewise he went</l>
       <l n="36">To Klondike with the rush . I think he owned</l>
       <l n="37">More kinds of mining stock than there were mines .</l>
       <l n="38">He had more quaint , peculiar men for friends</l>
       <l n="39">Than one could think were living . He believed</l>
       <l n="40">In every doctrine in its time , that promised</l>
       <l n="41">Salvation for the world . He took no thought</l>
       <l n="42">For life or for to-morrow , or for health ,</l>
       <l n="43">Slept with his windows closed , ate what he wished .</l>
       <l n="44">And if he cut his finger , let it go .</l>
       <l n="45">I offered him peroxide once , he laughed .</l>
       <l n="46">And when I asked him if his soul was saved</l>
       <l n="47">He only said : “ I see things . I lie back</l>
       <l n="48">And take it easy . Nothing can go wrong</l>
       <l n="49">In any serious sense . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="50">So many thought</l>
       <l n="51">Hosea was a nut , and others thought ,</l>
       <l n="52">That I was just a nut for liking him .</l>
       <l n="53">And what would any man of business say</l>
       <l n="54">If he knew that I did n't ask a question ,</l>
       <l n="55">But simply went with him to take the train</l>
       <l n="56">That day he asked me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="57">And the train had gone</l>
       <l n="58">Five miles or so when I said : “ Where you going ? ”</l>
       <l n="59">Hosea answered , and it made me start —</l>
       <l n="60">Hosea answered simply , “ We are going</l>
       <l n="61">To see Sir Galahad . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="62">It made me start</l>
       <l n="63">To hear Hosea say this , for I thought</l>
       <l n="64">He was now really off . But , I looked at him</l>
       <l n="65">And saw his eyes were sane .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="66">“ Sir Galahad ?</l>
       <l n="67">Who is Sir Galahad ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="68">Hosea answered :</l>
       <l n="69">“ I 'm going up to see Sir Galahad ,</l>
       <l n="70">And sound him out about re-entering</l>
       <l n="71">The game and run for governor again . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="72">So then I knew he was the man our fathers</l>
       <l n="73">Worked with and knew and called Sir Galahad ,</l>
       <l n="74">Now in retirement fifteen years or so .</l>
       <l n="75">Well , I was twenty-five when he was famous .</l>
       <l n="76">Sir Galahad was forty then , and now</l>
       <l n="77">Must be some fifty-five while I am forty .</l>
       <l n="78">So flashed across my thought the matter of time</l>
       <l n="79">And ages . So I thought of all he did :</l>
       <l n="80">Of how he went from faith to faith in politics</l>
       <l n="81">And ran for every office up to governor ,</l>
       <l n="82">And ran for governor four times or so ,</l>
       <l n="83">And never was elected to an office .</l>
       <l n="84">He drew more bills to remedy injustice ,</l>
       <l n="85">Improve the courts , relieve the poor , reform</l>
       <l n="86">Administration , than the legislature</l>
       <l n="87">Could read , much less digest or understand .</l>
       <l n="88">The people beat him and the leaders flogged him .</l>
       <l n="89">They shut the door against his face until</l>
       <l n="90">He had no place to go except a farm</l>
       <l n="91">Among the stony hills , and there he went .</l>
       <l n="92">And thither we were going to see the knight ,</l>
       <l n="93">And call him from his solitude to the fight</l>
       <l n="94">Against injustice , greed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="95">So we got off</l>
       <l n="96">The train at Alden , just a little village</l>
       <l n="97">Of fifty houses lying beneath the sprawl</l>
       <l n="98">Of hills and hills . And here there was a stillness</l>
       <l n="99">Made lonelier by an anvil ringing , by</l>
       <l n="100">A plow-man 's voice at intervals .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="101">Here Hosea</l>
       <l n="102">Engaged a horse and buggy , and we drove</l>
       <l n="103">And wound about a crooked road between</l>
       <l n="104">Great hills that stood together like the backs</l>
       <l n="105">Of elephants in a herd , where boulders lay</l>
       <l n="106">As thick as hail in places . Ruined pines</l>
       <l n="107">Stood like burnt matches . There was one which stuck</l>
       <l n="108">Against a single cloud so white it seemed</l>
       <l n="109">A bursted bale of cotton .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="110">We reached the summit</l>
       <l n="111">And drove along past orchards , past a field</l>
       <l n="112">Level and green , kept like a garden , rich</l>
       <l n="113">Against the coming harvest . Here we met</l>
       <l n="114">A scarecrow man , driving a scarecrow horse</l>
       <l n="115">Hitched to a wobbly wagon . And we stopped ,</l>
       <l n="116">The scarecrow stopped . The scarecrow and Hosea</l>
       <l n="117">Talked much of people and of farming — I</l>
       <l n="118">Sat listening , and I gathered from the talk ,</l>
       <l n="119">And what Hosea told me as we drove ,</l>
       <l n="120">That once this field so level and so green</l>
       <l n="121">The scarecrow owned . He had cleaned out the stumps ,</l>
       <l n="122">And tried to farm it , failed , and lost the field ,</l>
       <l n="123">But raged to lose it , thought he might succeed</l>
       <l n="124">In further time . Now having lost the field</l>
       <l n="125">So many years ago , could be a scarecrow ,</l>
       <l n="126">And drive a scarecrow horse , yet laugh again</l>
       <l n="127">And have no care , the sorrow healed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="128">It seemed</l>
       <l n="129">The clearing of the stumps was scarce a starter</l>
       <l n="130">Toward a field of profit . For in truth ,</l>
       <l n="131">The soil possessed a secret which the scarecrow</l>
       <l n="132">Never went deep enough to learn about .</l>
       <l n="133">His problem was all stumps . Not solving that ,</l>
       <l n="134">He sold it to a farmer who out-slaved</l>
       <l n="135">The busiest bee , but only half succeeded .</l>
       <l n="136">He tried to raise potatoes , made a failure .</l>
       <l n="137">He planted it in beans , had half a crop .</l>
       <l n="138">He sowed wheat once and reaped a stack of straw .</l>
       <l n="139">The secret of the soil eluded him .</l>
       <l n="140">And here Hosea laughed : “ This fellow 's failure</l>
       <l n="141">Was just the thing that gave another man</l>
       <l n="142">The secret of the soil . For he had studied</l>
       <l n="143">The properties of soils and fertilizers .</l>
       <l n="144">And when he heard the field had failed to raise</l>
       <l n="145">Potatoes , beans and wheat , he simply said :</l>
       <l n="146">There are other things to raise : the question is</l>
       <l n="147">Whether the soil is suited to the things</l>
       <l n="148">He tried to raise , or whether it needs building</l>
       <l n="149">To raise the things he tried to raise , or whether</l>
       <l n="150">It must be builded up for anything .</l>
       <l n="151">At least he said the field is clear of stumps .</l>
       <l n="152">Pass on your field , he said . If I lose out</l>
       <l n="153">I 'll pass it on . The field is his , he said</l>
       <l n="154">Who can make something grow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="155">And so this field</l>
       <l n="156">Of waving wheat along which we were driving</l>
       <l n="157">Was just the very field the scarecrow man</l>
       <l n="158">Had failed to master , as that other man</l>
       <l n="159">Had failed to master after him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="160">Hosea</l>
       <l n="161">Kept talking of this field as we drove on .</l>
       <l n="162">That field , he said , is economical</l>
       <l n="163">Of men compared with many fields . You see</l>
       <l n="164">It only used two men . To grub the stumps</l>
       <l n="165">Took all the scarecrow 's strength . That other man</l>
       <l n="166">Ran off to Oklahoma from this field .</l>
       <l n="167">I have known fields that ate a dozen men</l>
       <l n="168">In country such as this . The field remains</l>
       <l n="169">And laughs and waits for some one who divines</l>
       <l n="170">The secret of the field . Some farmers live</l>
       <l n="171">To prove what can n't be done , and narrow down</l>
       <l n="172">The guess of what is possible . It 's right</l>
       <l n="173">A certain crop should prosper and another</l>
       <l n="174">Should fail , and when a farmer tries to raise</l>
       <l n="175">A crop before it 's time , he wastes himself</l>
       <l n="176">And wastes the field to try .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="177">We now were climbing</l>
       <l n="178">To higher hills and rockier fields . Hosea</l>
       <l n="179">Had fallen into silence . I was thinking</l>
       <l n="180">About Sir Galahad , was wondering</l>
       <l n="181">Which man he was , the scarecrow , or the farmer</l>
       <l n="182">Who did n't know the seed to sow , or whether</l>
       <l n="183">He might still prove the farmer raising wheat ,</l>
       <l n="184">Now we were come to give him back the field</l>
       <l n="185">With all the stumps grubbed out , the secret lying</l>

       <l n="206">Bowed down upon his breast , locked fast in sleep .</l>
       <l n="207">And by his feet a dog half blind and fat</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">You dull Goliaths clothed in coats of blue ,</l>
       <l n="2">Strained and half bursted by the swell of flesh ,</l>
       <l n="3">Topped by Gorilla heads . You Marmoset ,</l>
       <l n="4">Trained scoundrel , taught to question and ensnare ,</l>
       <l n="5">I hate you , hate your laws and hate your courts .</l>
       <l n="6">Hands off , give me a chair , now let me be .</l>
       <l n="7">I 'll tell you more than you can think to ask me .</l>
       <l n="8">I love this woman , but what is love to you ?</l>
       <l n="9">What is it to your laws or courts ? I love her .</l>
       <l n="10">She loves me , if you 'd know . I entered her room —</l>
       <l n="11">She stood before me naked , shrank a little ,</l>
       <l n="12">Cried out a little , calmed her sudden cry</l>
       <l n="13">When she saw amiable passion in my eyes —</l>
       <l n="14">She loves me , if you 'd know . I saw in her eyes</l>
       <l n="15">More in those moments than whole hours of talk</l>
       <l n="16">From witness stands exculpate could make clear</l>
       <l n="17">My innocence .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="18">But if I did a crime</l>
       <l n="19">My excuse is hunger , hunger for more life .</l>
       <l n="20">Oh what a world , where beauty , rapture , love</l>
       <l n="21">Are walled in and locked up like coal or food</l>
       <l n="22">And only may he had by purchasers</l>
       <l n="23">From whose fat fingers slip the unheeded gold .</l>
       <l n="24">Oh what a world where beauty lies in waste ,</l>
       <l n="25">While power and freedom skulk with famished lips</l>
       <l n="26">Too tightly pressed for curses .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="27">So do men ,</l>
       <l n="28">Save for the thousandth man , deny themselves</l>
       <l n="29">And live in meagreness to make sure a life</l>
       <l n="30">Of meagreness by hearth stones long since stale ;</l>
       <l n="31">And live in ways , companionships as fixed</l>
       <l n="32">As the geared figures of the Strassburg clock .</l>
       <l n="33">You wonder at war ? Why war lets loose desires ,</l>
       <l n="34">Emotions long repressed . Would you stop war ?</l>
       <l n="35">Then let men live . The moral equivalent</l>
       <l n="36">Of war is freedom . Art does not suffice —</l>
       <l n="37">Religion is not life , but life is living .</l>
       <l n="38">And painted cherries to the hungry thrush</l>
       <l n="39">Is art to life . The artist lived his work .</l>
       <l n="40">You cannot live his life who love his work .</l>
       <l n="41">You are the thrush that pecks at painted cherries</l>
       <l n="42">Who hope to live through art . Beer-soaked Goliaths ,</l>
       <l n="43">The story 's coming of her nakedness</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="45">All this I learned</l>

       <l n="47">Till hunger drove me to this servile work</l>
       <l n="48">As butler in her father 's house , with time</l>
       <l n="49">On certain days to walk the galleries</l>
       <l n="50">And look at pictures , marbles . For I saw</l>
       <l n="51">I was not living while I painted pictures .</l>
       <l n="52">I was not living working for a crust ,</l>
       <l n="53">I was not living walking galleries :</l>
       <l n="54">All this was but vicarious life which felt</l>
       <l n="55">Through gazing at the thing the artist made ,</l>
       <l n="56">In memory of the life he lived himself :</l>
       <l n="57">As we preserve the fragrance of a flower</l>
       <l n="58">By drawing off its essence in a bottle ,</l>
       <l n="59">Where color , fluttering leaves , are thrown away</l>
       <l n="60">To get the inner passion of the flower</l>
       <l n="61">Extracted to a bottle that a queen</l>

       <l n="65">Your desks of editors , your woolsack benches</l>
       <l n="66">Where judges sit , that this dull hypocrite ,</l>
       <l n="67">You call the State , has fashioned life aright —</l>
       <l n="68">The secret is abroad , from eye to eye</l>
       <l n="69">The secret passes from poor eyes that wink</l>
       <l n="70">In boredom , in fatigue , in furious strength</l>
       <l n="71">Roped down or barred , that what the human heart</l>
       <l n="72">Dreams of and hopes for till the aspiring flame</l>
       <l n="73">Flaps in the guttered candle and goes out ,</l>
       <l n="74">Is love for body and for spirit , love</l>
       <l n="75">To satisfy their hunger . Yet what is it ,</l>
       <l n="76">This earth , this life , what is it but a meadow</l>
       <l n="77">Where spirits are left free a little while</l>
       <l n="78">Within a little space , so long as strength ,</l>
       <l n="79">Flesh , blood increases to the day of use</l>
       <l n="80">As roasts or stews wherewith this witless beast ,</l>

       <l n="98">Where my eyes daily rested on this woman</l>
       <l n="99">A thought came to me like a little spark</l>
       <l n="100">One sees far down the darkness of a cave ,</l>
       <l n="101">Which grows into a flame , a blinding light</l>
       <l n="102">As one approaches it , so did this thought</l>
       <l n="103">Both burn and blind me : For I loved this woman ,</l>
       <l n="104">I wanted her , why should I lose this woman ?</l>
       <l n="105">What was there to oppose possession ? Will ?</l>

       <l n="107">Which will is better , mine or hers ? Which will</l>
       <l n="108">Deserves achievement ? Which has rights above</l>
       <l n="109">The other ? I desire her , her desire</l>
       <l n="110">Is not toward me , which of these two desires</l>
       <l n="111">Shall triumph ? Why not mine for me and hers</l>
       <l n="112">For her , at least the stronger must prevail ,</l>

       <l n="114">That millionaire who wooed her , tried in vain</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="118">But as I said</l>
       <l n="119">I walked the galleries . When I stood in the yard</l>
       <l n="120">Bare armed , bare throated at my work , she came</l>
       <l n="121">And gazed upon me from her window . I</l>
       <l n="122">Could feel the exhausting influence of her eyes .</l>
       <l n="123">Then in a concentration which was blindness</l>
       <l n="124">To all else , so bewilderment of mind ,</l>
       <l n="125">I 'd go to see Watteau 's Antiope</l>
       <l n="126">Where he sketched Zeus in hunger , drawing back</l>
       <l n="127">The veil that hid her sleeping nakedness .</l>
       <l n="128">There was Correggio 's too , on whom a satyr</l>
       <l n="129">Smiled for his amorous wonder . A Semele ,</l>
       <l n="130">Done by an unknown hand , a thing of lightning</l>
       <l n="131">Moved through by Zeus who seized her as the flames</l>
       <l n="132">Consumed her ravished beauty .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="133">So I looked ,</l>
       <l n="134">And trembled , then returned perhaps to find</l>
       <l n="135">Her eyes upon me conscious , calm , elate ,</l>
       <l n="136">And radiate with lashes of surprise ,</l>
       <l n="137">Delight as when a star is still but shines .</l>
       <l n="138">And on this night somehow our natures worked</l>
       <l n="139">To climaxes . For first she dressed for dinner</l>
       <l n="140">To show more back and bosom than before .</l>
       <l n="141">And as I served her , her down-looking eyes</l>
       <l n="142">Were more than glances . Then she dropped her napkin .</l>
       <l n="143">Before I could begin to bend she leaned</l>
       <l n="144">And let me see — oh yes , she let me see</l>
       <l n="145">The white foam of her little breasts caressing</l>
       <l n="146">The scarlet flame of silk , a swooning shore</l>
       <l n="147">Of bright carnations . It was from such foam</l>
       <l n="148">That Venus rose . And as I stooped and gave</l>
       <l n="149">The napkin to her she pushed out a foot ,</l>
       <l n="150">And then I coughed for breath grown short , and she</l>
       <l n="151">Concealed a smile — and you , you jailers laugh</l>
       <l n="152">Coarse-mouthed , and mock my hunger .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="153">I go on ,</l>
       <l n="154">Observe how courage , boldness mark my steps !</l>
       <l n="155">At nine o'clock she climbs to her boudoir .</l>
       <l n="156">I finding errands in the hallway hear</l>
       <l n="157">The desultory taking up of books ,</l>
       <l n="158">And through her open door , see her at last</l>
       <l n="159">Cast off her dinner gown and to the bath</l>
       <l n="160">Step like a ray of moonlight . Then she snaps</l>
       <l n="161">The light on where the onyx tub and walls</l>
       <l n="162">Dazzle the air . I enter then her room</l>
       <l n="163">And stand against the closed door , do not pry</l>
       <l n="164">Upon her in the bath . Give her the chance</l>
       <l n="165">To fly me , fight me standing face to face .</l>
       <l n="166">I hear her flounder in the water , hear</l>
       <l n="167">Hands slap and slip with water breast and arms ;</l>
       <l n="168">Hear little sighs and shudders and the roughness</l>
       <l n="169">Of crash towels on her back , when in a minute</l>
       <l n="170">She stands with back toward me in the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="171">A sea-shell glory , pink and white to hair</l>
       <l n="172">Sun-lit , a lily crowned with powdered gold .</l>
       <l n="173">She turned toward her dresser then and shook</l>
       <l n="174">White dust of talcum on her arms , and looked</l>
       <l n="175">So lovingly upon her tense straight breasts ,</l>
       <l n="176">Touching them under with soft tapering hands</l>
       <l n="177">To blue eyes deepening like a brazier flame</l>
       <l n="178">Turned by a sudden gust . Who gives her these ,</l>
       <l n="179">The thought ran through me , for her joy alone</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="181">So I stood there like Zeus</l>

       <l n="196">That smile of hers not wilting me she clapped</l>
       <l n="197">Hands over eyes and said : “ I am afraid —</l>
       <l n="198">Oh no , it cannot be — what would they say ? ”</l>
       <l n="199">Then rushing in the bathroom , quick she slammed</l>
       <l n="200">The door and shrieked : “ You scoundrel , go — you beast . ”</l>
       <l n="201">My dream went up like paper charred and whirled</l>
       <l n="202">Above a hearth . Thrilling I stood alone</l>
       <l n="203">Amid her room and saw my life , our life</l>
       <l n="204">Embodied in this woman lately there</l>
       <l n="205">Lying and cowardly . And as I turned</l>
       <l n="206">To leave the room , her father and the gardener</l>
       <l n="207">Pounced on me , threw me down a flight of stairs</l>
       <l n="208">And turned me over , stunned , to you the law</l>
       <l n="209">Here with these others who have stolen coal</l>
       <l n="210">To keep them warm , as I have stolen beauty</l>
       <l n="211">To keep from freezing in this arid country</l>
       <l n="212">Of winter winds on which the dust of custom</l>
       <l n="213">Rides like a fog .</l>

      <head>THE LANDSCAPE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">You and your landscape ! There it lies</l>
       <l n="2">Stripped , resuming its disguise ,</l>
       <l n="3">Clothed in dreams , made bare again ,</l>
       <l n="4">Symbol infinite of pain ,</l>
       <l n="5">Rapture , magic , mystery</l>
       <l n="6">Of vanished days and days to be .</l>
       <l n="7">There 's its sea of tidal grass</l>
       <l n="8">Over which the south winds pass ,</l>
       <l n="9">And the sun-set 's Tuscan gold</l>
       <l n="10">Which the distant windows hold</l>
       <l n="11">For an instant like a sphere</l>
       <l n="12">Bursting ere it disappear .</l>
       <l n="13">There 's the dark green woods which throve</l>
       <l n="14">In the spell of Leese 's Grove .</l>
       <l n="15">And the winding of the road ;</l>
       <l n="16">And the hill o'er which the sky</l>
       <l n="17">Stretched its pallied vacancy</l>
       <l n="18">Ere the dawn or evening glowed .</l>
       <l n="19">And the wonder of the town</l>
       <l n="20">Somewhere from the hill-top down</l>
       <l n="21">Nestling under hills and woods</l>
       <l n="22">And the meadow 's solitudes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="23">And your paper knight of old</l>
       <l n="24">Secrets of the landscape told .</l>
       <l n="25">And the hedge-rows where the pond</l>
       <l n="26">Took the blue of heavens beyond</l>
       <l n="27">The hastening clouds of gusty March .</l>
       <l n="28">There you saw their wrinkled arch</l>
       <l n="29">Where the East wind cracks his whips</l>
       <l n="30">Round the little pond and clips</l>
       <l n="31">Main-sails from your toppled ships . ...</l>

       <l n="32">Landscape that in youth you knew</l>
       <l n="33">Past and present , earth and you !</l>
       <l n="34">All the legends and the tales</l>
       <l n="35">Of the uplands , of the vales ;</l>
       <l n="36">Sounds of cattle and the cries</l>
       <l n="37">Of ploughmen and of travelers</l>
       <l n="38">Were its soul 's interpreters .</l>
       <l n="39">And here the lame were always lame .</l>
       <l n="40">Always gray the gray of head .</l>
       <l n="41">And the dead were always dead</l>
       <l n="42">Ere the landscape had become</l>
       <l n="43">Your cradle , as it was their tomb .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="44">And when the thunder storms would waken</l>
       <l n="45">Of the dream your soul was not forsaken :</l>
       <l n="46">In the room where the dormer windows look —</l>
       <l n="47">There were your knight and the tattered book .</l>
       <l n="48">With colors of the forest green</l>
       <l n="49">Gabled roofs and the demesne</l>
       <l n="50">Of faery kingdoms and faery time</l>
       <l n="51">Storied in pre-natal rhyme . ...</l>
       <l n="52">Past the orchards , in the plain</l>
       <l n="53">The cattle fed on in the rain .</l>
       <l n="54">And the storm-beaten horseman sped</l>
       <l n="55">Rain blinded and with bended head .</l>
       <l n="56">And John the ploughman comes and goes</l>
       <l n="57">In labor wet , with steaming clothes .</l>
       <l n="58">This is your landscape , but you see</l>
       <l n="59">Not terror and not destiny</l>
       <l n="60">Behind its loved , maternal face ,</l>
       <l n="61">Its power to change , or fade , replace</l>
       <l n="62">Its wonder with a deeper dream ,</l>
       <l n="63">Unfolding to a vaster theme .</l>
       <l n="64">From time eternal was this earth ?</l>
       <l n="65">No less this landscape with your birth</l>
       <l n="66">Arose , nor leaves you , nor decay</l>
       <l n="67">Finds till the twilight of your day .</l>
       <l n="68">It bore you , moulds you to its plan .</l>
       <l n="69">It ends with you as it began ,</l>
       <l n="70">But bears the seed of future years</l>
       <l n="71">Of higher raptures , dumber tears .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="72">For soon you lose the landscape through</l>
       <l n="73">Absence , sorrow , eyes grown true</l>
       <l n="74">To the naked limbs which show</l>
       <l n="75">Buds that never more may blow .</l>
       <l n="76">Now you know the lame were straight</l>
       <l n="77">Ere you knew them , and the fate</l>
       <l n="78">Of the old is yet to die .</l>
       <l n="79">Now you know the dead who lie</l>
       <l n="80">In the graves you saw where first</l>
       <l n="81">The landscape on your vision burst ,</l>
       <l n="82">Were not always dead , and now</l>

       <l n="85">Some are gone , though years are few</l>
       <l n="86">Since you roamed with them the hills .</l>

       <l n="90">For you return and find it bare :</l>
       <l n="91">There is no heaven of golden air .</l>
       <l n="92">Your eyes around the horizon rove ,</l>
       <l n="93">A clump of trees is Leese 's Grove .</l>

       <l n="109">And you who nourished me and bred</l>
       <l n="110">I find the spirit from you fled .</l>
       <l n="111">You gave me dreams ,' twas at your breast</l>
       <l n="112">My soul 's beginning rose and pressed</l>
       <l n="113">My steps afar at last and shaped</l>
       <l n="114">A world elusive , which escaped</l>
       <l n="115">Whatever love or thought could find</l>
       <l n="116">Beyond the tireless wings of mind .</l>
       <l n="117">Yet grown by you , and feeding on</l>
       <l n="118">Your strength as mother , you are gone</l>
       <l n="119">When I return from living , trace</l>
       <l n="120">My steps to see how I began ,</l>
       <l n="121">And deeply search your mother face</l>
       <l n="122">To know your inner self , the place</l>

       <l n="10">As a mad younker</l>

       <l n="13">Of change , or passing time , or secret thoughts .</l>
       <l n="14">If it was spring he sighed it , if ‘ twas fall ,</l>

       <l n="17">This habit of his grief . And on a time</l>
       <l n="18">As he stood looking at the flying clouds ,</l>
       <l n="19">I loitering near , expectant , heard him say it ,</l>
       <l n="20">Inquired , “ Why do you say ‘ Ah , mercy me , ’</l>
       <l n="21">Now that it 's April ? ” So he hobbled off</l>

       <l n="27">Slaved by a mood which must have breath — “ Tra-la !</l>
       <l n="28">That 's what I say instead of “ Ah , mercy me . ”</l>
       <l n="29">For look you , Ben , I catch myself with “ Tra-la ”</l>

       <l n="32">I say , “ Tra-la ” unknowing . Oft at table</l>
       <l n="33">I say , “ Tra-la . ” And ‘ tother day , poor Anne</l>
       <l n="34">Looked long at me and said , “ You say , ‘ Tra-la ’</l>
       <l n="35">Sometimes when you 're asleep ; why do you so ? ”</l>
       <l n="36">Then I bethought me of that aged man</l>

       <l n="39">The song crops out in slumber — who can say ? ”</l>
       <l n="40">And Anne arose , began to keel the pot ,</l>

       <l n="1">Only a few plants up — and not a blossom</l>

       <l n="6">What comes of letting Hunter do your work .</l>
       <l n="7">The ground was not plowed right , or disced perhaps ,</l>
       <l n="8">Or harrowed fine enough , or too little seed</l>
       <l n="9">Was sown .</l>

       <l n="10">But John , who knows a clover field ,</l>

       <l n="13">He says , Look at the roots !</l>

       <l n="16">Clover bacteria to make it grow ,</l>
       <l n="17">And blossom . In a thrifty field of clover</l>
       <l n="18">The roots are studded thick with tubercles ,</l>
       <l n="19">Like little warts , made by bacteria .</l>

       <l n="21">Upon the nitrogen that fills the soil ,</l>
       <l n="22">And make the plants grow , make them blossom too .</l>
       <l n="23">When Hunter sowed this field he was not well :</l>
       <l n="24">He should have hauled some top-soil to this field</l>
       <l n="25">From some old clover field , or made a culture</l>

       <l n="34">To run away from . Wife and children too</l>
       <l n="35">Are pretty hard to leave , since thought of them</l>
       <l n="36">Stays with a fellow and cannot be left .</l>
       <l n="37">Yes , Hunter 's back , but he can n't work for you .</l>
       <l n="38">He 's straightening out his little farm and making</l>
       <l n="39">Provision for his family . Hunter 's changed .</l>

      <head>FRONT THE AGES WITH A SMILE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">How did the sculptor , Voltaire , keep you quiet and posed</l>
       <l n="2">In an arm chair , just think , at your busiest age we are told ,</l>
       <l n="3">Being better than seventy ? How did he manage to stay you</l>
       <l n="4">From hopping through Europe for long enough time for his work ,</l>
       <l n="5">Which shows you in marble , the look and the smile and the nose ,</l>
       <l n="6">The filleted brow very bald , the thin little hands ,</l>
       <l n="7">The posture pontifical , face imperturbable , smile so serene .</l>
       <l n="8">How did the sculptor detain you , you ever so restless ,</l>
       <l n="9">You ever so driven by princes and priests ? So I stand here</l>
       <l n="10">Enwrapped of this face of you , frail little frame of you ,</l>
       <l n="11">And think of your work — how nothing could balk you</l>
       <l n="12">Or quench you or damp you . How you twisted and turned ,</l>
       <l n="13">Emerged from the fingers of malice , emerged with a laugh ,</l>
       <l n="14">Kept Europe in laughter , in turmoil , in fear</l>
       <l n="15">For your eighty-four years !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="16">And they say of you still</l>
       <l n="17">You were light and a mocker ! You should have been solemn ,</l>
       <l n="18">And argued with monkeys and swine , speaking truthfully always .</l>
       <l n="19">Nay , truthful with whom , to what end ? With a breed such as lived</l>
       <l n="20">In your day and your place ? It was never their due !</l>
       <l n="21">Truth for the truthful and true , and a lie for the liar if need be —</l>
       <l n="22">A board out of plumb for a place out of plumb , for the hypocrite flashes</l>
       <l n="23">Of lightning or rods red hot for thrusting in tortuous places .</l>
       <l n="24">Well , this was your way , you lived out the genius God gave you .</l>
       <l n="25">And they hated you for it , hunted you all over Europe —</l>
       <l n="26">Why should they not hate you ? Why should you not follow your light ?</l>
       <l n="27">But wherever they drove you , you climbed to a place more satiric .</l>
       <l n="28">Did France bar her door ? Geneva remained — good enough !</l>
       <l n="29">Les Delices close to some several cantons , you know .</l>
       <l n="30">Would they lay hands upon you ? I fancy you laughing ,</l>
       <l n="31">You stand at your door and step into Vaud by one path ;</l>
       <l n="32">You stand at your door and step by another to France —</l>
       <l n="33">Such safe jurisdictions , in truth , as the Illinois rowdies</l>
       <l n="34">Step from county to county ahead of the frustrate policeman .</l>
       <l n="35">And here you have printers to print what you write and a house</l>
       <l n="36">For the acting of plays , La Pucelle , Orphelin .</l>

       <l n="38">So England conservative , England of Southey and Burke ,</l>
       <l n="39">The fox-hunting squires , the England of Church and of State ,</l>
       <l n="40">The England half mule and half ox , writes you down , O Voltaire :</l>
       <l n="41">The quack grass of popery flourished in France , you essayed</l>
       <l n="42">To plow up the tangle , and harrow the roots from the soil .</l>
       <l n="43">It took a good ploughman to plow it , a ploughman of laughter ,</l>
       <l n="44">A ploughman who laughed when the plow struck the roots , and your breast</l>
       <l n="45">Was thrown on the handles .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="46">And yet to this day , O Voltaire ,</l>
       <l n="47">They charge you with levity , scoffing , when all that you did</l>
       <l n="48">Was to plough up the quack grass , and turn up the roots to the sun ,</l>
       <l n="49">And let the sun kill them . For laughter is sun-light ,</l>
       <l n="50">And nothing of worth or of truth needs to fear it .</l>
       <l n="51">But listen</l>
       <l n="52">The strength of a nation is mind , I will grant you , and still</l>
       <l n="53">But give it a tongue read and spoken more greatly than others ,</l>
       <l n="54">That nation can judge true or false and the judgment abides .</l>
       <l n="55">The judgment in English condemns you , where is there a judgment</l>
       <l n="56">To save you from this ? Is it German , or Russian , or French ?</l>

       <l n="63">Forever that all of this sacrifice , service was noble ,</l>

       <l n="68">How well did you know that life to a genius , a god ,</l>

       <l n="191">That Hamilton — we 'll say , is so revered ,</l>
       <l n="192">So lauded , toasted , all his papers studied</l>
       <l n="193">On tariffs and on banks , evoking ahs !</l>
       <l n="194">Great genius ! and so forth — and there 's the Crisis</l>
       <l n="195">And Common Sense which only little Shelleys</l>
       <l n="196">Haunting the dusty book shops read at all .</l>
       <l n="197">It was n't that he liked his rum and drank</l>
       <l n="198">Too much at times , or chased a pretty skirt —</l>
       <l n="199">For Hamilton did that . Paine never mixed</l>
       <l n="200">In money matters to another 's wrong</l>
       <l n="201">For his sake or a system 's . Yes , I know</l>
       <l n="202">The world cares more for chastity and temperance</l>
       <l n="203">Than for a faultless life in money matters .</l>
       <l n="204">No use to dramatize that vital contrast ,</l>
       <l n="205">The world to-day is what it always was .</l>
       <l n="206">But you do n't call this Hamilton an artist</l>
       <l n="207">And Paine a mere logician and a wrangler ?</l>
       <l n="208">Your artist soul gets limed in this mad world</l>
       <l n="209">As much as any . There is Leonardo —</l>
       <l n="210">The point 's not here .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="211">I think it 's more like this :</l>
       <l n="212">Some men are Titans and some men are gods ,</l>
       <l n="213">And some are gods who fall while climbing back</l>
       <l n="214">Up to Olympus whence they came . And some</l>
       <l n="215">While fighting for the race fall into holes</l>
       <l n="216">Where to return and rescue them is death .</l>
       <l n="217">Why look you here ! You 'd think America</l>
       <l n="218">Had gone to war to cheat the guillotine</l>
       <l n="219">Of Thomas Paine , in fiery gratitude .</l>
       <l n="220">He 's there in France 's national assembly ,</l>
       <l n="221">And votes to save King Louis with this phrase :</l>
       <l n="222">Do n't kill the man but kill the kingly office .</l>
       <l n="223">They think him faithless to the revolution</l>
       <l n="224">For words like these — and clap ! the prison door</l>
       <l n="225">Shuts on our Thomas . So he writes a letter</l>
       <l n="226">To president — of what ! to Washington</l>
       <l n="227">President of the United States of America ,</l>
       <l n="228">A title which Paine coined in seventy-seven</l>
       <l n="229">Now lettered on a monstrous seal of state !</l>
       <l n="230">And Washington is silent , never answers ,</l>
       <l n="231">And leaves our Thomas shivering in a cell ,</l>
       <l n="232">Who hears the guillotine go slash and click !</l>
       <l n="233">Perhaps this is the nucleus of my drama .</l>
       <l n="234">Or else to show that Washington was wise</l>
       <l n="235">Respecting England 's hatred of our Thomas ,</l>
       <l n="236">And wise to lift no finger to save Thomas ,</l>
       <l n="237">Incurring England 's wrath , who hated Thomas</l>
       <l n="238">For pamphlets like the “ Crisis ” “ Common Sense . ”</l>
       <l n="239">That may be just the story for my drama .</l>
       <l n="240">Old Homer satirized the human race</l>
       <l n="241">For warring for the rescue of a Cyprian .</l>
       <l n="242">But there 's not stuff for satire in a war</l>
       <l n="243">Ensuing on the insult for the rescue</l>
       <l n="244">Of nothing but a fellow who wrote pamphlets ,</l>
       <l n="245">And won a continent for the rescuer .</l>
       <l n="246">That 's tragedy , the more so if the fellow</l>
       <l n="247">Likes rum and writes that Jesus was a man .</l>
       <l n="248">This crushing of poor Thomas in the hate</l>
       <l n="249">Of England and her power , America 's</l>
       <l n="250">Great fear and lowered strength might make a drama</l>
       <l n="251">As showing how the more you do in life</l>
       <l n="252">The greater shall you suffer . This is true ,</l>
       <l n="253">If what you battered down gets hold of you .</l>
       <l n="254">This drama almost drives me mad at times .</l>
       <l n="255">I have his story at my fingers ’ ends .</l>
       <l n="256">But it wo n't take a shape . It flies my hands .</l>
       <l n="257">I think I 'll have to give it up . What 's that ?</l>
       <l n="258">Well , if an audience of to-day would turn</l>
       <l n="259">From seeing Thomas Paine upon the stage</l>
       <l n="260">What is the use to write it , if they 'd turn</l>
       <l n="261">No matter how you wrote it ? I believe</l>
       <l n="262">They would n't like it in America ,</l>
       <l n="263">Nor England either , maybe — you are right !</l>
       <l n="264">A drama with no audience is a failure .</l>
       <l n="265">But here 's this skull . What shall I do with it ?</l>
       <l n="266">If I should have it cased in solid silver</l>
       <l n="267">There is no shrine to take it — no Cologne</l>
       <l n="268">For skulls like this .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="269">Well , I must die sometime ,</l>
       <l n="270">And who will get it then ? Look at this skull !</l>
       <l n="271">This bony hand ! Then look at me , my friend :</l>

      <head>IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I arise in the silence of the dawn hour .</l>
       <l n="2">And softly steal out to the garden</l>
       <l n="3">Under the Favrile goblet of the dawning .</l>
       <l n="4">And a wind moves out of the south-land ,</l>
       <l n="5">Like a film of silver ,</l>
       <l n="6">And thrills with a far borne message</l>
       <l n="7">The flowers of the garden .</l>
       <l n="8">Poppies untie their scarlet hoods and wave them</l>
       <l n="9">To the south wind as he passes .</l>
       <l n="10">But the zinnias and calendulas ,</l>
       <l n="11">In a mood of calm reserve , nod faintly</l>
       <l n="12">As the south wind whispers the secret</l>
       <l n="13">Of the dawn hour !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="14">I stand in the silence of the dawn hour</l>
       <l n="15">In the garden ,</l>
       <l n="16">As the star of morning fades .</l>
       <l n="17">Flying from scythes of air</l>
       <l n="18">The hare-bells , purples and golden glow</l>
       <l n="19">On the sand-hill back of the orchard</l>
       <l n="20">Race before the feet of the wind .</l>
       <l n="21">But clusters of oak-leaves over the yellow sand rim</l>
       <l n="22">Begin to flutter and glisten .</l>
       <l n="23">And in a moment , in a twinkled passion ,</l>
       <l n="24">The blazing rapiers of the sun are flashed ,</l>
       <l n="25">As he fences the lilac lights of the sky ,</l>
       <l n="26">And drives them up where the ice of the melting moon</l>

       <l n="46">Caught in the twinkling oak leaves :</l>
       <l n="47">Poppies who wave their untied hoods to the south wind ;</l>
       <l n="48">And the imperious bows of zinnias and calendulas ;</l>
       <l n="49">The star of morning drowned , and lights of lilac</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">( Dedicated to Vachel Lindsay and in Memory of Richard E. Burke )</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Said dear old Dick</l>
       <l n="3">To the colored waiter :</l>
       <l n="4">“ Here , George ! be quick</l>
       <l n="5">Roast beef and a potato .</l>
       <l n="6">I 'm due at the courthouse at half-past one ,</l>
       <l n="7">You black old scoundrel , get a move on you !</l>
       <l n="8">I want a pot of coffee and a graham bun .</l>
       <l n="9">This vinegar decanter 'll make a groove on you ,</l>
       <l n="10">You black-faced mandril , you grinning baboon — ”</l>
       <l n="11">“ Yas sah ! Yas sah ," answered the coon .</l>
       <l n="12">“ Now do n't you talk back , ” said dear old Dick ,</l>
       <l n="13">“ Go and get my dinner or I 'll show you a trick</l>
       <l n="14">With a plate , a tumbler or a silver castor ,</l>
       <l n="15">Fuliginous monkey , sired by old Nick . ”</l>
       <l n="16">And the nigger all the time was moving round the table ,</l>
       <l n="17">Rattling the silver things faster and faster —</l>
       <l n="18">“ Yes sah ! Yas sah , soon as I'se able</l>
       <l n="19">I 'll bring yo ’ dinnah as shore as yo 's bawn . ”</l>
       <l n="20">“ Quit talking about it ; hurry and be gone ,</l>
       <l n="21">You low-down nigger , ” said dear old Dick .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="22">Then I said to my friend : “ Suppose he 'd up and stick</l>
       <l n="23">A knife in your side for raggin ’ him so hard ;</l>
       <l n="24">Or how would you relish some spit in your broth ?</l>
       <l n="25">Or a little Paris green in your cheese for chard ?</l>
       <l n="26">Or something in your coffee to make your stomach froth ?</l>
       <l n="27">Or a bit of asafoetida hidden in your pie ?</l>
       <l n="28">That 's a gentlemanly nigger or he 'd black your eye / ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="29">Then dear old Dick made this long reply :</l>
       <l n="30">“ You know , I love a nigger ,</l>
       <l n="31">And I love this nigger .</l>
       <l n="32">I met him first on the train from California</l>
       <l n="33">Out of Kansas City ; in the morning early</l>
       <l n="34">I walked through the diner , feeling upset</l>
       <l n="35">For a cup of coffee , looking rather surly .</l>
       <l n="36">And there sat this nigger by a table all dressed ,</l>
       <l n="37">Waiting for the time to serve the omelet ,</l>
       <l n="38">Buttered toast and coffee to the passengers .</l>
       <l n="39">And this is what he said in a fine southern way :</l>
       <l n="40">‘ Good mawnin , ’ sah , I hopes yo ’ had yo ’ rest ,</l>
       <l n="41">I 'm glad to see you on dis sunny day . ’</l>
       <l n="42">Now think ! here 's a human who has no other cares</l>
       <l n="43">Except to please the white man , serve him when he 's starving ,</l>
       <l n="44">And who has as much fun when he sees you carving</l>
       <l n="45">The sirloin as you do , does this black man .</l>
       <l n="46">Just think for a minute , how the negroes excel ,</l>
       <l n="47">Can you beat them with a banjo or a broiling pan ?</l>
       <l n="48">There 's music in their soul as original</l>
       <l n="49">As any breed of people in the whole wide earth ;</l>
       <l n="50">They 're elemental hope , heartiness , mirth .</l>
       <l n="51">There are only two things real American :</l>
       <l n="52">One is Christian Science , the other is the nigger .</l>
       <l n="53">Think it over for yourself and see if you can figure</l>
       <l n="54">Anything beside that is not imitation</l>
       <l n="55">Of something in Europe in this hybrid nation .</l>
       <l n="56">Return to this globe five hundred years hence —</l>
       <l n="57">You 'll see how the fundamental color of the coon</l>
       <l n="58">In art , in music , has altered our tune ;</l>
       <l n="59">We are destined to bow to their influence ;</l>
       <l n="60">There 's a whole cult of music in Dixie alone ,</l>
       <l n="61">And that is America put into tone . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="62">And dear old Dick gathered speed and said :</l>
       <l n="63">“ Sometimes through Dvorák a vision arises</l>
       <l n="64">To the words of Merneptah whose hands were red :</l>
       <l n="65">‘ I shall live , I shall live , I shall grow , I shall grow ,</l>
       <l n="66">I shall wake up in peace , I shall thrill with the glow</l>
       <l n="67">Of the life of Temu , the god who prizes</l>
       <l n="68">Favorite souls and the souls of kings . ’</l>
       <l n="69">Now these are the words , and here is the dream ,</l>
       <l n="70">No wonder you think I am seeing things :</l>
       <l n="71">The desert of Egypt shimmers in the gleam</l>
       <l n="72">Of the noonday sun on my dazzled sight .</l>
       <l n="73">And a giant negro as black as night</l>
       <l n="74">Is walking by a camel in a caravan .</l>
       <l n="75">His great back glistens with the streaming sweat .</l>
       <l n="76">The camel is ridden by a light-faced man ,</l>
       <l n="77">A Greek perhaps , or Arabian .</l>
       <l n="78">And this giant negro is rhythmically swaying</l>
       <l n="79">With the rhythm of the camel 's neck up and down .</l>
       <l n="80">He seems to be singing , rollicking , playing ;</l>
       <l n="81">His ivory teeth are glistening , the Greek is listening</l>
       <l n="82">To the negro keeping time like a tabouret .</l>
       <l n="83">And what cares he for Memphis town ,</l>
       <l n="84">Merneptah the bloody , or Books of the Dead ,</l>
       <l n="85">Pyramids , philosophies of madness or dread ?</l>
       <l n="86">A tune is in his heart , a reality :</l>
       <l n="87">The camel , the desert are things that be ,</l>
       <l n="88">He 's a negro slave , but his heart is free . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="89">Just then the colored waiter brought in the dinner .</l>
       <l n="90">“ Get a hustle on you , you miserable sinner , ”</l>
       <l n="91">Said dear old Dick to the colored waiter .</l>
       <l n="92">“ Heah 's a nice piece of beef and a great big potato .</l>
       <l n="93">I hopes yo 'll enjoy ‘ em sah , yas I do ;</l>
       <l n="94">Heah 's black mustahd greens , ‘ specially for yo ’ ,</l>
       <l n="95">And a fine piece of jowl that I swiped and took</l>
       <l n="96">From a dish set by , by the git-away cook .</l>
       <l n="97">I hope yo 'll enjoy ‘ em , sah , yas I do . ”</l>
       <l n="98">“ Well , George , ” Dick said , “ if Gabriel blew</l>
       <l n="99">His horn this minute , you 'd up and ascend</l>
       <l n="100">To wait on St. Peter world without end . ”</l>

      <head>THE ROOM OF MIRRORS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I saw a room where many feet were dancing .</l>
       <l n="2">The ceiling and the wall were mirrors glancing</l>
       <l n="3">Both flames of candles and the heaven 's light ,</l>
       <l n="4">Though windows there were none for air or flight .</l>
       <l n="5">The room was in a form polygonal</l>
       <l n="6">Reached by a little door and narrow hall .</l>
       <l n="7">One could behold them enter for the dance ,</l>
       <l n="8">And waken as it were out of a trance ,</l>
       <l n="9">And either singly or with some one whirl :</l>
       <l n="10">The old , the young , full livers , boy and girl .</l>
       <l n="11">And every panel of the room was just</l>
       <l n="12">A mirrored door through which a hand was thrust</l>
       <l n="13">Here , there , around the room , a soul to seize</l>
       <l n="14">Whereat a scream would rise , but no surcease</l>
       <l n="15">Of music or of dancing , save by him</l>
       <l n="16">Drawn through the mirrored panel to the dim</l>
       <l n="17">And unknown space behind the flashing mirrors ,</l>
       <l n="18">And by his partner struck through by the terrors</l>
       <l n="19">Of sudden loss .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="20">And looking I could see</l>
       <l n="21">That scarcely any dancer here could free</l>
       <l n="22">His eyes from off the mirrors , but would gaze</l>
       <l n="23">Upon himself or others , till a craze</l>
       <l n="24">Shone in his eyes thus to anticipate</l>
       <l n="25">The hand that took each dancer soon or late .</l>
       <l n="26">Some analyzed themselves , some only glanced ,</l>
       <l n="27">Some stared and paled and then more madly danced .</l>
       <l n="28">One dancer only never looked at all .</l>
       <l n="29">He seemed soul captured by the carnival .</l>
       <l n="30">There were so many dancers there he loved ,</l>
       <l n="31">He was so greatly by the music moved ,</l>
       <l n="32">He had no time to study his own face</l>
       <l n="33">There in the mirrors as from place to place</l>
       <l n="34">He quickly danced .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="35">Until I saw at last</l>
       <l n="36">This dancer by the whirling dancers cast</l>
       <l n="37">Face full against a mirrored panel where</l>
       <l n="38">Before he could look at himself or stare</l>
       <l n="39">He plunged through to the other side — and quick ,</l>
       <l n="40">As water closes when you lift the stick ,</l>
       <l n="41">The mirrored panel swung in place and left</l>
       <l n="42">No trace of him , as ‘ twere a magic trick .</l>
       <l n="43">But all his partners thus so soon bereft</l>
       <l n="44">Went dancing to the music as before .</l>
       <l n="45">But I saw faces in that mirrored door</l>
       <l n="46">Anatomizing their forced smiles and watching</l>
       <l n="47">Their faces over shoulders , even matching</l>
       <l n="48">Their terror with each other 's to repress</l>
       <l n="49">A growing fear in seeing it was less</l>
       <l n="50">Than some one else 's , or to ease despair</l>
       <l n="51">By looking in a face who did not care ,</l>
       <l n="52">While watching for the hand that through some door</l>
       <l n="53">Caught a poor dancer from the dancing floor</l>
       <l n="54">With every time-beat of the orchestra .</l>
       <l n="55">What is this room of mirrors ? Who can say ?</l>

      <head>THE LETTER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">What does one gain by living ? What by dying</l>
       <l n="2">Is lost worth having ? What the daily things</l>
       <l n="3">Lived through together make them worth the while</l>
       <l n="4">For their sakes or for life 's ? Where 's the denying</l>
       <l n="5">Of souls through separation ? There 's your smile !</l>
       <l n="6">And your hands ’ touch ! And the long day that brings</l>
       <l n="7">Half uttered nothings of delight ! But then</l>
       <l n="8">Now that I see you not , and shall again</l>
       <l n="9">Touch you no more — memory can possess</l>
       <l n="10">Your soul 's essential self , and none the less</l>
       <l n="11">You live with me . I therefore write to you</l>
       <l n="12">This letter just as if you were away</l>
       <l n="13">Upon a journey , or a holiday ;</l>
       <l n="14">And so I 'll put down everything that 's new</l>
       <l n="15">In this secluded village , since you left . ...</l>
       <l n="16">Now let me think ! Well , then , as I remember ,</l>
       <l n="17">After ten days the lilacs burst in bloom .</l>
       <l n="18">We had spring all at once — the long December</l>
       <l n="19">Gave way to sunshine . Then we swept your room ,</l>
       <l n="20">And laid your things away . And then one morning</l>
       <l n="21">I saw the mother robin giving warning</l>
       <l n="22">To little bills stuck just above the rim</l>
       <l n="23">Of that nest which you watched while being built ,</l>
       <l n="24">Near where she sat , upon a leafless limb ,</l>
       <l n="25">With folded wings against an April rain .</l>
       <l n="26">On June the tenth Edward and Julia married ,</l>
       <l n="27">I did not go for fear of an old pain .</l>
       <l n="28">I was out on the porch as they drove by ,</l>
       <l n="29">Coming from church . I think I never scanned</l>
       <l n="30">A girl 's face with such sunny smiles upon it</l>
       <l n="31">Showing beneath the roses on her bonnet —</l>
       <l n="32">I went into the house to have a cry .</l>
       <l n="33">A few days later Kimbrough lost his wife .</l>
       <l n="34">Between housework and hoeing in the garden</l>
       <l n="35">I read Sir Thomas More and Goethe 's life .</l>
       <l n="36">My heart was numb and still I had to harden</l>
       <l n="37">All memory or die . And just the same</l>
       <l n="38">As when you sat beside the window , passed</l>
       <l n="39">Larson , the cobbler , hollow-chested , lamed .</l>
       <l n="40">He did not die till late November came .</l>
       <l n="41">Things did not come as Doctor Jones forecast ,</l>
       <l n="42">‘ Twas June when Mary Morgan had her child .</l>
       <l n="43">Her husband was in Monmouth at the time .</l>
       <l n="44">She had no milk , the baby is not well .</l>
       <l n="45">The Baptist Church has got a fine new bell .</l>
       <l n="46">And after harvest Joseph Clifford tiled</l>
       <l n="47">His bottom land . Then Judy Heaton 's crime</l>
       <l n="48">Has shocked the village , for the monster killed</l>
       <l n="49">Glendora Wilson 's father at his door —</l>
       <l n="50">A daughter 's name was why the blood was spilled .</l>
       <l n="51">I could go on , but wherefore tell you more ?</l>
       <l n="52">The world of men has gone its olden way</l>
       <l n="53">With war in Europe and the same routine</l>
       <l n="54">Of life among us that you knew when here .</l>
       <l n="55">This gossip is not idle , since I say</l>
       <l n="56">By means of it what I would tell you , dear :</l>
       <l n="57">I have been near you , dear , for I have been</l>
       <l n="58">Not with you through these things , but in despite</l>
       <l n="59">Of living them without you , therefore near</l>
       <l n="60">In spirit and in memory with you .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="61">Do you remember that delightful Inn</l>
       <l n="62">At Chester and the Roman wall , and how</l>
       <l n="63">We walked from Avon clear to Kenilworth ?</l>
       <l n="64">And afterward when you and I came down</l>
       <l n="65">To London , I forsook the murky town ,</l>
       <l n="66">And left you to quaint ways and crowded places ,</l>
       <l n="67">While I went on to Putney just to see</l>
       <l n="68">Old Swinburne and to look into his face 's</l>
       <l n="69">Changeable lights and shadows and to seize on</l>
       <l n="70">A finer thing than any verse he wrote ?</l>
       <l n="71">( Oh beautiful illusions of our youth ! )</l>
       <l n="72">He did not see me gladly . Talked of treason</l>
       <l n="73">To England 's greatness . What was Camden like ?</l>
       <l n="74">Did old Walt Whitman smoke or did he drink ?</l>
       <l n="75">And Longfellow was sweet , but could n't think .</l>
       <l n="76">His mood was crusty . Lowell made him laugh !</l>
       <l n="77">Meantime Watts-Dunton came and broke in half</l>
       <l n="78">My visit , so I left .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="79">The thing was this :</l>
       <l n="80">None of this talk was Swinburne any more</l>
       <l n="81">Than some child of his loins would take his hair ,</l>
       <l n="82">Eyes , skin , from him in some pangenesis ,—</l>
       <l n="83">His flesh was nothing but a poor affair ,</l>
       <l n="84">A channel for the eternal stream — his flesh</l>
       <l n="85">Gave nothing closer , mind you , than his book ,</l>
       <l n="86">But rather blurred it ; even his eyes ’ look</l>
       <l n="87">Confused “ Madonna Mia ” from its fresh</l>
       <l n="88">And liquid meaning . So I knew at last</l>
       <l n="89">His real immortal self is in his verse .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="90">Since you have gone I 've thought of this so much .</l>
       <l n="91">I cannot lose you in this universe —</l>
       <l n="92">I first must lose myself . The essential touch</l>
       <l n="93">Of soul possession lies not in the walk</l>
       <l n="94">Of daily life on earth , nor in the talk</l>
       <l n="95">Of daily things , nor in the sight of eyes</l>
       <l n="96">Looking in other eyes , nor daily bread</l>
       <l n="97">Broken together , nor the hour of love</l>
       <l n="98">When flesh surrenders depths of things divine</l>
       <l n="99">Beyond all vision , as they were the dream</l>
       <l n="100">Of other planets , but without these even</l>
       <l n="101">In death and separation , there is heaven :</l>
       <l n="102">By just that unison and its memory</l>
       <l n="103">Which brought our lips together . To be free</l>
       <l n="104">From accidents of being , to be freeing</l>
       <l n="105">The soul from trammels on essential being ,</l>
       <l n="106">Is to possess the loved one . I have strayed</l>
       <l n="107">Into the only heaven God has made :</l>
       <l n="108">That 's where we know each other as we are ,</l>
       <l n="109">In the bright ether of some quiet star ,</l>
       <l n="110">Communing as two memories with each other .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="68">And then we ran .</l>
       <l n="69">And the others lagged behind me ,</l>
       <l n="70">Like smoke behind the wind .</l>
       <l n="71">But the faces of Young Coyote , Rattler , Little Fox</l>
       <l n="72">Grew dark .</l>

       <l n="78">To find a match .</l>
       <l n="79">And to get wagers of ponies , nuggets of copper ,</l>
       <l n="80">And nuggets of gold .</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="82">It was under a sky as blue as the cup of a harebell ,</l>

       <l n="86">Hundreds of Indians came to the race .</l>
       <l n="87">They babbled , smoked and quarreled .</l>
       <l n="88">And everyone carried a knife ,</l>
       <l n="89">And everyone carried a gun .</l>
       <l n="90">And we runners —</l>
       <l n="91">How young we were and unknowing</l>
       <l n="92">What the race meant to them !</l>

       <l n="96">And I saw no one but Tobacco Jim .</l>
       <l n="97">But the Indians and the squaws saw much else ,</l>
       <l n="98">They thought of the race in such different ways</l>
       <l n="99">From the way we thought of it .</l>
       <l n="100">For with me it was honor ,</l>
       <l n="101">It was triumph ,</l>
       <l n="102">It was fame .</l>
       <l n="103">It was the tender looks of Indian maidens</l>
       <l n="104">Wherever I went .</l>
       <l n="105">But now I know that to Tobacco Jim ,</l>
       <l n="106">And the old fathers and young bucks</l>
       <l n="107">The race meant jugs of whiskey ,</l>
       <l n="108">And new guns .</l>
       <l n="109">It meant a squaw ,</l>
       <l n="110">A pony ,</l>
       <l n="111">Or some rise in the life of the tribe .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="112">So the shot of the starter rang at last ,</l>
       <l n="113">And we were off .</l>
       <l n="114">I wore a band of yellow around my brow</l>
       <l n="115">With an eagle 's feather in it ,</l>

       <l n="120">And they were all behind me ,</l>
       <l n="121">As the cloud 's shadow is behind</l>
       <l n="122">The bend of the grass under the wind .</l>
       <l n="123">But as we neared the end of the race</l>
       <l n="124">The onlookers , the gamblers , the old Indians ,</l>
       <l n="125">And the young bucks ,</l>
       <l n="126">Crowded close to the track —</l>

       <l n="4">To deities or devils . To resume</l>
       <l n="5">We find it caused by morphological</l>
       <l n="6">Changes of the cortex cells . Sometimes ,</l>
       <l n="7">More times , indeed , the anatomical</l>
       <l n="8">Basis , if one be , escapes detection .</l>
       <l n="9">For many functions of the cortex are</l>
       <l n="10">Unknown , as I have said .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">And now remember</l>
       <l n="12">Mercier 's analysis of heredity :</l>
       <l n="13">Besides direct transmission of unstable</l>
       <l n="14">Nervous systems , there remains the law</l>
       <l n="15">Hereditary of sanguinity .</l>
       <l n="16">Then here 's another matter : Parents may</l>
       <l n="17">Have normal nervous systems , yet produce</l>
       <l n="18">Children of abnormal nerves and minds ,</l>
       <l n="19">Caused by unsuitable sexual germs .</l>
       <l n="20">Let me repeat before I leave the matter</l>
       <l n="21">The factors in a perfect organization :</l>
       <l n="22">First quality in the germ producing matter ;</l>
       <l n="23">Then quality in the sperm producing force ,</l>
       <l n="24">And lastly relative fitness of the two .</l>
       <l n="25">We are but plants , however high we rise ,</l>
       <l n="26">Whatever thoughts we have , or dreams we dream</l>
       <l n="27">We are but plants , and all we are and do</l>
       <l n="28">Depends upon the seed and on the soil .</l>
       <l n="29">What Mendel found in raising peas may lead</l>
       <l n="30">To perfect knowledge of the human mind .</l>
       <l n="31">There is one law for men and peas , the law</l>
       <l n="32">Makes peas of certain matter , and makes men</l>
       <l n="33">And mind of certain matter , all depends</l>
       <l n="34">Not on a varying law , but on a law</l>
       <l n="35">Varied in its course by matter , as</l>
       <l n="36">The arm , which is a lever and which works</l>
       <l n="37">By lever principle cannot make use</l>
       <l n="38">And form cement with trowel to the forms</l>
       <l n="39">It makes of paint or marble .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="40">To resume :</l>
       <l n="41">A child may take the qualities of one parent</l>
       <l n="42">In some respects , and of the other parent</l>
       <l n="43">In some respects . A child may have the traits</l>
       <l n="44">Of father at one period of his life ,</l>
       <l n="45">The mother at one period of his life .</l>
       <l n="46">And if the parents ’ traits are similar</l>
       <l n="47">Their traits may be prepotent in a child ,</l>
       <l n="48">Thus giving rise to qualities convergent .</l>
       <l n="49">So if you take a circle and draw off</l>
       <l n="50">A line which would become another circle</l>
       <l n="51">If drawn enough , completed , but is left</l>
       <l n="52">Half drawn or less , that illustrates a mind</l>
       <l n="53">Of cumulative heredity . Take John ,</l>
       <l n="54">My gardener , John , within his sphere is perfect ,</l>
       <l n="55">John has a mind which is a perfect circle .</l>
       <l n="56">A perfect circle can be small , you know .</l>
       <l n="57">And so John has good sense within his sphere .</l>
       <l n="58">But if some force began to work like yeast</l>
       <l n="59">In brain cells , and his mind shot forth a line</l>
       <l n="60">To make a larger thinking circle , say</l>
       <l n="61">About a great invention , heaven or God ,</l>
       <l n="62">Then John would be abnormal , till this line</l>
       <l n="63">Shot round and joined , became a larger circle .</l>
       <l n="64">This is the secret of eccentric genius ,</l>
       <l n="65">The man is half a sphere , sticks out in space</l>
       <l n="66">Does not enclose co-ordinated thought .</l>
       <l n="67">He 's like a plant mutating , half himself</l>
       <l n="68">Half something new and greater . If we looked</l>
       <l n="69">To John 's heredity we 'd find this change</l>
       <l n="70">Was manifest in mother or in father</l>
       <l n="71">About the self-same period of life ,</l>
       <l n="72">Most likely in his father . Attributes</l>
       <l n="73">Of fathers are inherited by sons ,</l>

       <l n="103">But this is scarce significant . Let me tell</l>
       <l n="104">How Jacob Groesbell looked :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="105">The man was tall ,</l>
       <l n="106">Had shapely hands and feet , but awkward limbs .</l>
       <l n="107">His hair was brown and fine , his forehead high ,</l>
       <l n="108">And ran back at an angle , temples full .</l>
       <l n="109">His nose was long and fleshy at the point ,</l>
       <l n="110">Was tilted to one side . His eyes were gray ,</l>
       <l n="111">The iris flecked . They looked as if a light</l>
       <l n="112">As of a sun-set shone behind them . Ears</l>
       <l n="113">Were very large , projected at right angles .</l>
       <l n="114">His neck was slender , womanish . His skin</l>
       <l n="115">Of finest texture , white and very smooth .</l>
       <l n="116">His voice was quiet , musical . His manner</l>
       <l n="117">Patient and gentle , modest , reasonable .</l>
       <l n="118">His parents , as I learned through inquiry ,</l>
       <l n="119">Were Methodists , devout and greatly loved .</l>
       <l n="120">The mother healthy both in mind and body .</l>
       <l n="121">The father was eccentric , perhaps insane .</l>
       <l n="122">They were first cousins .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="123">I knew Jacob Groesbell</l>
       <l n="124">Ten years before he died . I knew him first</l>
       <l n="125">When he was sent to mend my porch . A workman</l>
       <l n="126">With saw and hammer never excelled him . Then</l>
       <l n="127">As time went on I saw him when he came</l>
       <l n="128">At my request to do my carpentry .</l>
       <l n="129">I grew to know him , and by slow degrees</l>
       <l n="130">He told me of his readings in the Bible ,</l>
       <l n="131">And gave me his interpretations . At last</l>
       <l n="132">Aged forty-six , had ulcers of the stomach ,</l>
       <l n="133">Which took him off . He sent for me , and said</l>
       <l n="134">He wished me to attend him , which I did .</l>
       <l n="135">He told me I could have his body and brain</l>
       <l n="136">To lecture on , dissect , since some had said</l>
       <l n="137">He was insane , he told me , and if so</l>
       <l n="138">I should find something wrong with brain or body .</l>
       <l n="139">And if I found a wrong then all his visions</l>
       <l n="140">Of God and archangels were just the fancies</l>
       <l n="141">That come to madmen . So he made provision</l>
       <l n="142">To give his brain and body for this cause ,</l>
       <l n="143">And here 's his brain and skull , and I am lecturing</l>
       <l n="144">On Jacob Groesbell as a paranoic .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="145">As I have said before , in making tests</l>
       <l n="146">And observations of the patient , have</l>
       <l n="147">His conversation taken stenographically ,</l>
       <l n="148">In order to preserve his speech exactly ,</l>
       <l n="149">And catch the flow if he becomes excited .</l>
       <l n="150">So we determine if he makes new words ,</l>
       <l n="151">If he be incoherent , or repeats .</l>
       <l n="152">I took my secretary once to make</l>
       <l n="153">A stenographic record . Strange enough</l>
       <l n="154">He would not talk while she was writing down .</l>
       <l n="155">And when I asked him why , he would not tell .</l>
       <l n="156">So I devised a scheme : I took a satchel ,</l>
       <l n="157">And put in it a dictaphone , and when</l>
       <l n="158">A cylinder was full I 'd stoop and put</l>
       <l n="159">My hand among my bottles in the satchel ,</l>
       <l n="160">As if I was compounding medicine ,</l>
       <l n="161">Instead I 'd put another cylinder on .</l>
       <l n="162">And thus I got his story in his voice ,</l>
       <l n="163">Just as he talked , with nothing lost at all ,</l>
       <l n="164">Which you shall hear . For with this megaphone</l>
       <l n="165">The students in the farthest gallery</l>
       <l n="166">Can hear what Jacob Groesbell said to me ,</l>
       <l n="167">And weigh the thought that stirred within the brain</l>
       <l n="168">Here in this jar beside me . Listen now</l>

       <l n="1">June , but we kept the fire place piled with logs ,</l>
       <l n="2">And every day it rained . And every morning</l>
       <l n="3">I heard the wind and rain among the leaves .</l>
       <l n="4">Try as I would my spirits grew no better .</l>
       <l n="5">What was it ? Was I ill or sick in mind ?</l>
       <l n="6">I spent the whole day working with my hands ,</l>
       <l n="7">For there was brush to clear and corn to plant</l>
       <l n="8">Between the gusts of rain ; and there at night</l>
       <l n="9">I sat about the room and hugged the fire .</l>
       <l n="10">And the rain dripped and the wind blew , we shivered</l>
       <l n="11">For cold and it was June . I ached all through</l>
       <l n="12">For my hard labor , why did muscles grow not</l>
       <l n="13">To hardness and cure body , if ‘ twere body ,</l>

       <l n="17">Of sleep , and restless in this interval</l>
       <l n="18">Of nothingness , the silence out-of-doors ,</l>
       <l n="19">Timed by the dripping rain , and by the slap</l>
       <l n="20">Of cards upon a table by a boarder</l>
       <l n="21">Who passed the time in playing solitaire ,</l>
       <l n="22">Sometimes my ancient host would fill his pipe ,</l>

       <l n="24">To show me what had happened in his life .</l>
       <l n="25">And as he smoked and talked his aged wife</l>
       <l n="26">Would parallel his theme , as a brooks ’ branches</l>
       <l n="27">Formed by a slender island , flow together .</l>
       <l n="28">Or yet again she 'd intercalate a touch ,</l>
       <l n="29">An episode or version . And sometimes</l>
       <l n="30">He 'd make her hush ; or sometimes he 'd suspend</l>
       <l n="31">While she went on to what she wished to finish ,</l>
       <l n="32">When he 'd resume . They talked together thus .</l>
       <l n="33">He found the story and began to tell it ,</l>

       <l n="25">An inner light , a Presence , Secret splendor ,</l>
       <l n="26">I clap hands over eyes , for the earth reels ;</l>
       <l n="27">And I have fears of dieties shown or spun</l>

       <l n="29">The earth has stayed itself , I see the lake ,</l>
       <l n="30">The leaves , the light of the sun , the cyclop hoods</l>
       <l n="31">Of thunder heads , yet feel upon my arm</l>
       <l n="32">A hand I know , and hear a voice I know —</l>

       <l n="35">The voice says : “ Leave the sphinx .</l>

       <l n="37">And I arise and follow down a slope</l>
       <l n="38">To a lawn by the lake and an ancient seat of stone ,</l>
       <l n="39">And near it a fountain 's shattered rim enclosing</l>

       <l n="41">Consciously dimples for the unveiled pistil of love ,</l>
       <l n="42">As he strokes with baby hand the slender arching</l>
       <l n="43">Neck of a swan . And here is a peristyle</l>

       <l n="48">With feet of a Babylonian lion amid</l>
       <l n="49">This ruined garden of yellow daisies , poppies</l>
       <l n="50">And ruddy asphodel from Crete , it seems ,</l>
       <l n="51">Though here is our western moon as white and thin</l>
       <l n="52">As an abalone shell hung under the boughs</l>
       <l n="53">Of an oak , that is mocked by the vastness of sky between</l>

       <l n="59">This gradual growth from algae , reeds and grasses ,</l>
       <l n="60">That builds the soil against the water 's hands ,</l>
       <l n="61">All things are fierce for place and garner life</l>

       <l n="133">I might have asked</l>

       <l n="136">Planted this garden , why and to what end ,</l>
       <l n="137">And why this fight for place , for soil and sun</l>

       <l n="139">Between the things here planted , and between</l>
       <l n="140">Flying or crawling life and plants , and whence</l>
       <l n="141">The power that falls in one place but arises</l>
       <l n="142">Some other place ; and why the unceasing growth</l>

       <l n="155">Of good or beauty made experiments</l>
       <l n="156">With seed or soils or crossings of the seed .</l>
       <l n="157">Even as peoples , epochs , did the garden</l>

       <l n="170">Goths , Vandals , Tartars , striving for more life ,</l>
       <l n="171">And praying to the urge within as God ,</l>
