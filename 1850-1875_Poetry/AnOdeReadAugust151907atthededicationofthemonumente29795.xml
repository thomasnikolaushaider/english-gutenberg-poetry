     <l n="16">For faith and truth .</l>
     <l n="17">Here they the corner-stone</l>

     <l n="22">Here , with God 's aid ,</l>
     <l n="23">Conquered the wilderness ,</l>

      <l n="255">And at her front one star ,</l>
      <l n="256">Refulgent hope ,</l>
      <l n="257">Like that on morning 's slope ,</l>
      <l n="258">Beaconing the world afar .—</l>
      <l n="259">From her high place she sees</l>
      <l n="260">Her long procession of accomplished acts .</l>
      <l n="261">Cloud-wing 'd refulgences</l>
      <l n="262">Of thoughts in steel and stone , of marble dreams ,</l>
      <l n="263">Lift up tremendous battlements ,</l>
      <l n="264">Sun-blinding , built of facts ;</l>
      <l n="265">While in her soul she seems ,</l>
      <l n="266">Listening , to hear , as from innumerable tents ,</l>
      <l n="267">Æonian thunder , wonder , and applause</l>
      <l n="268">Of all the heroic ages that are gone ;</l>
      <l n="269">Feeling secure</l>
      <l n="270">That , as her Past , her Future shall endure ,</l>
      <l n="271">As did her Cause</l>
      <l n="272">When redly broke the dawn</l>
      <l n="273">Of fierce rebellion , and , beneath its star ,</l>
      <l n="274">The firmaments of war</l>
      <l n="275">Poured down infernal rain ,</l>
      <l n="276">And North and South lay bleeding ‘ mid their slain .</l>
      <l n="277">And now , no less , shall her Cause still prevail ,</l>
      <l n="278">More so in peace than war ,</l>
      <l n="279">Through the thrilled wire and electric rail ,</l>
      <l n="280">Carrying her message far ;</l>
      <l n="281">Shaping her dream</l>
      <l n="282">Within the brain of steam ,</l>
      <l n="283">That , with a myriad hands ,</l>
      <l n="284">Labors unceasingly , and knits her lands</l>
      <l n="285">In firmer union ; joining plain and stream</l>
      <l n="286">With steel ; and binding shore to shore</l>
      <l n="287">With bands of iron ;— nerves and arteries ,</l>
      <l n="288">Along whose adamant forever pour</l>
      <l n="289">Her concrete thoughts , her tireless energies .</l>

     <l n="1">Old days , old ways , old homes beside the sea ;</l>
     <l n="2">Old gardens with old-fashioned flowers aflame ,</l>
     <l n="3">Poppy , petunia , and many a name</l>
     <l n="4">Of many a flower of fragrant pedigree .</l>
     <l n="5">Old hills that glow with blue - and barberry ,</l>
     <l n="6">And rocks and pines that stand on guard , the same .</l>
     <l n="7">Immutable , as when the Pilgrim came ,</l>
     <l n="8">And here laid firm foundations of the Free .</l>
     <l n="9">The sunlight makes the dim dunes hills of snow ,</l>
     <l n="10">And every vessel 's sail a twinkling wing</l>
     <l n="11">Glancing the violet ocean far away :</l>
     <l n="12">The world is full of color and of glow ;</l>
     <l n="13">A mighty canvas whereon God doth fling</l>
     <l n="14">The flawless picture of a perfect day .</l>

    <head>“ THE HIGHLANDS , ” ANNISQUAM</head>
     <l n="1">Here , from the heights , among the rocks and pines ,</l>
     <l n="2">The sea and shore seem some tremendous page</l>
     <l n="3">Of some vast book , great with our heritage ,</l>
     <l n="4">Breathing the splendor of majestic lines .</l>
     <l n="5">Yonder the dunes speak silver ; yonder shines</l>
     <l n="6">The ocean 's sapphire word ; there , gray with age ,</l>
     <l n="7">The granite writes its lesson , strong and sage ;</l>
     <l n="8">And there the surf its rhythmic passage signs .</l>
     <l n="9">The winds , that sweep the page , that interlude</l>
     <l n="10">Its majesty with music ; and the tides ,</l>
     <l n="11">That roll their thunder in , that period</l>
     <l n="12">Its mighty rhetoric , deep and dream-imbued ,</l>
     <l n="13">Are what it seems to say , of what abides ,</l>
     <l n="14">Of what 's eternal , and of what is God .</l>

    <head>STORM AT ANNISQUAM</head>
     <l n="1">The sun sinks scarlet as a barberry .</l>
     <l n="2">Far off at sea one vessel lifts a sail ,</l>
     <l n="3">Hurrying to harbor from the coming gale ,</l>
     <l n="4">That banks the west above a choppy sea .</l>
     <l n="5">The sun is gone ; the tide is flowing free ;</l>
     <l n="6">The bay is opaled with wild light ; and pale</l>
     <l n="7">The lighthouse spears its flame now ; through a veil</l>
     <l n="8">That falls about the sea mysteriously .</l>
     <l n="9">Out there she sits and mutters of her dead ,</l>
     <l n="10">Old Ocean ; of the stalwart and the strong ,</l>
     <l n="11">Skipper and fisher whom her arms dragged down :</l>
     <l n="12">Before her now she sees their ghosts ; o'erhead ,</l>
     <l n="13">As gray as rain , their wild wrecks sweep along ,</l>
     <l n="14">And all night long lay siege to this old town .</l>

    <head>FROM COVE TO COVE</head>
     <l n="1">The road leads up a hill through many a brake ,</l>
     <l n="2">Blueberry and barberry , bay and sassafras ,</l>
     <l n="3">By an abandoned quarry , where , like glass ,</l>
     <l n="4">A round pool lies ; an isolated lake ,</l>
     <l n="5">A mirror for what presences , that make</l>
     <l n="6">Their wildwood toilets here ! The road is grass</l>
     <l n="7">Gray-scarred with stone : great bowlders , as we pass ,</l>
     <l n="8">Slope burly shoulders towards us . Cedars shake</l>
     <l n="9">Wild balsam from their tresses ; there and here</l>
     <l n="10">Clasping a glimpse of ocean and of shore</l>
     <l n="11">In arms of swaying green . Below , at last ,</l>
     <l n="12">Beside the sea , with derrick and with pier ,</l>
     <l n="13">By heaps of granite , noise of drill and bore ,</l>
     <l n="14">A Cape Ann town , towering with many a mast .</l>

    <head>PASTURES BY THE SEA</head>
     <l n="1">Here where the coves indent the shore and fall</l>
     <l n="2">And fill with ebb and flowing of the tides ;</l>
     <l n="3">Whereon some barge rocks or some dory rides ,</l>
     <l n="4">By which old orchards bloom , or , from the wall ,</l>
     <l n="5">Pelt every lane with fruit ; where gardens , tall</l>
     <l n="6">With roses , riot ; swift my gladness glides</l>
     <l n="7">To that old pasture where the mushroom hides ,</l>
     <l n="8">The chicory blooms and Peace sits mid them all .</l>
     <l n="9">Fenced in with rails and rocks , its emerald slopes ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Ribbed with huge granite ,— where the placid cows</l>
     <l n="11">Tinkle a browsing bell , roll to a height</l>
     <l n="12">Wherefrom the sea , bright as adventuring hopes ,</l>
     <l n="13">Swept of white sails and plowed of foaming prows ,</l>
     <l n="14">Leaps like a Nereid on the ravished sight .</l>

    <head>THE DUNES</head>
     <l n="1">Far as the eye can see , in domes and spires ,</l>
     <l n="2">Buttress and curve , ruins of shifting sand ,—</l>
     <l n="3">In whose wild making wind and sea took hand ,—</l>
     <l n="4">The white dunes stretch . The wind , that never tires ,</l>
     <l n="5">Striving for strange effects that he admires ,</l>
     <l n="6">Changes their form from time to time ; the land</l>
     <l n="7">Forever passive to his mad demand ,</l>
     <l n="8">And to the sea 's , who with the wind conspires .</l>
     <l n="9">Here , as on towers of desolate cities , bay</l>
     <l n="10">And wire-grass grow , wherein no insect cries ,</l>
     <l n="11">Only a bird , the swallow of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="12">That homes in sand . I hear it far away</l>
     <l n="13">Crying — or is it some lost soul that flies ,</l>
     <l n="14">Above the land , ailing unceasingly ?</l>

    <head>BY THE SUMMER SEA</head>
     <l n="1">Sunlight and shrill cicada and the low ,</l>
     <l n="2">Slow , sleepy kissing of the sea and shore ,</l>
     <l n="3">And rumor of the wind . The morning wore</l>
     <l n="4">A sullen face of fog that lifted slow ,</l>
     <l n="5">Letting her eyes gleam through of grayest glow ;</l>
     <l n="6">Wearing a look like that which once she wore</l>
     <l n="7">When , Gloucesterward from Dogtown there , they bore</l>
     <l n="8">Some old witchwife with many a gibe and blow .</l>
     <l n="9">But now the day has put off every care ,</l>
     <l n="10">And sits at peace beside the smiling sea ,</l>
     <l n="11">Dreaming bright dreams with lazy-lidded eyes :</l>
     <l n="12">One is a castle , precipiced in air ,</l>
     <l n="13">And one a golden galleon — can it be</l>
     <l n="14">‘ Tis but the cloudworld of the sunset skies ?</l>
