     <p>“ I shall never , in the years remaining , Paint you pictures , no , nor carve you statues , Make you music that should all-express me ; So it seems : I stand on my attainment . This of verse alone , one life allows me ; Verse and nothing else have I to give you . Other heights in other lives , God willing : All the gifts from all the heights , your own , Love ! ” ROBERT BROWNING .</p>

       <l n="1">My soul awoke from slumber — the long ease</l>
       <l n="2">Of years that passed away in dull content ,</l>
       <l n="3">Not caring what the world 's deep voices meant —</l>
       <l n="4">Sunk in my dreams , I heard their harmonies</l>
       <l n="5">Like wind-blown clamour of far-calling seas</l>
       <l n="6">That told of Ithaca to sailors spent</l>
       <l n="7">With trouble , and forgetful at the scent</l>
       <l n="8">And taste of fruit plucked from the lotus trees ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">For as I slept , your footsteps on the grass ,</l>
       <l n="10">Your voice , wrought once again the Miracle</l>
       <l n="11">Of Eden ; and I saw appear and pass</l>
       <l n="12">Eve in her beauty , binding still the spell</l>
       <l n="13">That Adam felt , when from his opened side</l>
       <l n="14">Stepped Woman forth in loveliness and pride .</l>

        <l n="17">An opalescent splendour , like a noon</l>
        <l n="18">Of lilies ; and I wonder that the height</l>
        <l n="19">Should darken for the depth to give me light —</l>
        <l n="20">Light of your face , so lovely that I swoon</l>
        <l n="21">With gazing , and then wake to find how soon</l>
        <l n="22">Joy of the world fades when you fade from sight .</l>

        <l n="32">Fill one far valley to a purple sea ;</l>
        <l n="33">And white-domed cities rise with porphyry ,</l>
        <l n="34">Jacinth and sapphire gates , beneath the heights ,</l>
        <l n="35">Rose-flamed within the dawn where Ph [ oe ] bus smites</l>

        <l n="46">Down to a garden ; there the rose distills</l>
