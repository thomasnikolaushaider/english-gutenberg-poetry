     <l n="1">My rhymes are rough , and often in my rhyming</l>
     <l n="2">I 've drifted , silver-sailed , on seas of dream ,</l>
     <l n="3">Hearing afar the bells of Elfland chiming ,</l>
     <l n="4">Seeing the groves of Arcadie agleam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I was the thrall of Beauty that rejoices</l>
     <l n="6">From peak snow-diademed to regal star ;</l>
     <l n="7">Yet to mine aerie ever pierced the voices ,</l>
     <l n="8">The pregnant voices of the Things That Are .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The Here , the Now , the vast Forlorn around us ;</l>
     <l n="10">The gold-delirium , the ferine strife ;</l>
     <l n="11">The lusts that lure us on , the hates that hound us ;</l>
     <l n="12">Our red rags in the patch-work quilt of Life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The nameless men who nameless rivers travel ,</l>
     <l n="14">And in strange valleys greet strange deaths alone ;</l>
     <l n="15">The grim , intrepid ones who would unravel</l>
     <l n="16">The mysteries that shroud the Polar Zone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">These will I sing , and if one of you linger</l>
     <l n="18">Over my pages in the Long , Long Night ,</l>
     <l n="19">And on some lone line lay a calloused finger ,</l>
     <l n="20">Saying : “ It 's human-true — it hits me right ” ;</l>
     <l n="21">Then will I count this loving toil well spent ;</l>
     <l n="22">Then will I dream awhile — content , content .</l>

     <l n="24">Men of the High North , the wild sky is blazing ;</l>

     <l n="26">Swift splendors kindle , barbaric , amazing ;</l>
     <l n="27">Pale ports of amber , golden argosies .</l>
     <l n="28">Ringed all around us the proud peaks are glowing ;</l>
     <l n="29">Fierce chiefs in council , their wigwam the sky ;</l>
     <l n="30">Far , far below us the big Yukon flowing ,</l>
     <l n="31">Like threaded quicksilver , gleams to the eye .</l>

     <l n="32">Men of the High North , you who have known it ;</l>
     <l n="33">You in whose hearts its splendors have abode ;</l>
     <l n="34">Can you renounce it , can you disown it ?</l>
     <l n="35">Can you forget it , its glory and its goad ?</l>
     <l n="36">Where is the hardship , where is the pain of it ?</l>
     <l n="37">Lost in the limbo of things you 've forgot ;</l>
     <l n="38">Only remain the guerdon and gain of it ;</l>

     <l n="43">There with your soul on the Top o ’ the World ?</l>
     <l n="44">Nights when no peril could keep you awake on</l>
     <l n="45">Spruce boughs you spread for your couch in the snow ;</l>
     <l n="46">Taste all your feasts like the beans and the bacon</l>
     <l n="47">Fried at the camp-fire at forty below ?</l>

     <l n="48">Can you remember your huskies all going ,</l>
     <l n="49">Barking with joy and their brushes in air ;</l>
     <l n="50">You in your parka , glad-eyed and glowing ,</l>
     <l n="51">Monarch , your subjects the wolf and the bear ?</l>
     <l n="52">Monarch , your kingdom unravisht and gleaming ;</l>
     <l n="53">Mountains your throne , and a river your car ;</l>
     <l n="54">Crash of a bull moose to rouse you from dreaming ;</l>
     <l n="55">Forest your couch , and your candle a star .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="56">You who this faint day the High North is luring</l>
     <l n="57">Unto her vastness , taintlessly sweet ;</l>
     <l n="58">You who are steel-braced , straight-lipped , enduring ,</l>
     <l n="59">Dreadless in danger and dire in defeat :</l>
     <l n="60">Honor the High North ever and ever ,</l>
     <l n="61">Whether she crown you , or whether she slay ;</l>

     <l n="64">Men of the High North , fierce mountains love you ;</l>

     <l n="66">See , the austere sky , pensive above you ,</l>
     <l n="67">Dons all her jewels to smile on your rest .</l>
     <l n="68">Children of Freedom , scornful of frontiers ,</l>
     <l n="69">We who are weaklings honor your worth .</l>
     <l n="70">Lords of the wilderness , Princes of Pioneers ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="73">One of the Down and Out — that 's me . Stare at me well , ay , stare !</l>
     <l n="74">Stare and shrink — say ! you would n't think that I was a millionaire .</l>
     <l n="75">Look at my face , it 's crimped and gouged — one of them death-mask things ;</l>
     <l n="76">Do n't seem the sort of man , do I , as might be the pal of kings ?</l>
     <l n="77">Slouching along in smelly rags , a bleary-eyed , no-good bum ;</l>
     <l n="78">A knight of the hollow needle , pard , spewed from the sodden slum .</l>
     <l n="79">Look me all over from head to foot ; how much would you think I was worth ?</l>
     <l n="80">A dollar ? a dime ? a nickel ? Why , I 'M THE WEALTHIEST MAN ON EARTH .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="81">No , do n't you think that I 'm off my base . You 'll sing a different tune</l>
     <l n="82">If only you 'll let me spin my yarn . Come over to this saloon ;</l>
     <l n="83">Wet my throat — it 's as dry as chalk , and seeing as how it 's you ,</l>
     <l n="84">I 'll tell the tale of a Northern trail , and so help me God , it 's true .</l>
     <l n="85">I 'll tell of the howling wilderness and the haggard Arctic heights ,</l>
     <l n="86">Of a reckless vow that I made , and how I STAKED THE NORTHERN LIGHTS .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="87">Remember the year of the Big Stampede and the trail of Ninety-eight ,</l>
     <l n="88">When the eyes of the world were turned to the North ,</l>
     <l n="89">and the hearts of men elate ;</l>
     <l n="90">Hearts of the old dare-devil breed thrilled at the wondrous strike ,</l>
     <l n="91">And to every man who could hold a pan came the message , “ Up and hike ” .</l>
     <l n="92">Well , I was there with the best of them , and I knew I would not fail .</l>
     <l n="93">You would n't believe it to see me now ; but wait till you 've heard my tale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="94">You 've read of the trail of Ninety-eight , but its woe no man may tell ;</l>
     <l n="95">It was all of a piece and a whole yard wide ,</l>
     <l n="96">and the name of the brand was “ Hell ” .</l>
     <l n="97">We heard the call and we staked our all ; we were plungers playing blind ,</l>
     <l n="98">And no man cared how his neighbor fared , and no man looked behind ;</l>
     <l n="99">For a ruthless greed was born of need , and the weakling went to the wall ,</l>
     <l n="100">And a curse might avail where a prayer would fail ,</l>
     <l n="101">and the gold lust crazed us all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="102">Bold were we , and they called us three the “ Unholy Trinity ” ;</l>
     <l n="103">There was Ole Olson , the sailor Swede , and the Dago Kid and me .</l>
     <l n="104">We were the discards of the pack , the foreloopers of Unrest ,</l>
     <l n="105">Reckless spirits of fierce revolt in the ferment of the West .</l>
     <l n="106">We were bound to win and we revelled in the hardships of the way .</l>
     <l n="107">We staked our ground and our hopes were crowned ,</l>
     <l n="108">and we hoisted out the pay .</l>
     <l n="109">We were rich in a day beyond our dreams ,</l>
     <l n="110">it was gold from the grass-roots down ;</l>
     <l n="111">But we were n't used to such sudden wealth , and there was the siren town .</l>
     <l n="112">We were crude and careless frontiersmen , with much in us of the beast ;</l>
     <l n="113">We could bear the famine worthily , but we lost our heads at the feast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="114">The town looked mighty bright to us , with a bunch of dust to spend ,</l>
     <l n="115">And nothing was half too good them days , and everyone was our friend .</l>
     <l n="116">Wining meant more than mining then , and life was a dizzy whirl ,</l>
     <l n="117">Gambling and dropping chunks of gold down the neck of a dance-hall girl ;</l>
     <l n="118">Till we went clean mad , it seems to me , and we squandered our last poke ,</l>
     <l n="119">And we sold our claim , and we found ourselves one bitter morning — broke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="120">The Dago Kid he dreamed a dream of his mother 's aunt who died —</l>
     <l n="121">In the dawn-light dim she came to him , and she stood by his bedside ,</l>
     <l n="122">And she said : “ Go forth to the highest North till a lonely trail ye find ;</l>
     <l n="123">Follow it far and trust your star , and fortune will be kind . ”</l>
     <l n="124">But I jeered at him , and then there came the Sailor Swede to me ,</l>
     <l n="125">And he said : “ I dreamed of my sister 's son ,</l>
     <l n="126">who croaked at the age of three .</l>
     <l n="127">From the herded dead he sneaked and said : ` Seek you an Arctic trail ;</l>
     <l n="128">‘ Tis pale and grim by the Polar rim , but seek and ye shall not fail . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="129">And lo ! that night I too did dream of my mother 's sister 's son ,</l>
     <l n="130">And he said to me : “ By the Arctic Sea there 's a treasure to be won .</l>
     <l n="131">Follow and follow a lone moose trail , till you come to a valley grim ,</l>
     <l n="132">On the slope of the lonely watershed that borders the Polar brim . ”</l>
     <l n="133">Then I woke my pals , and soft we swore by the mystic Silver Flail ,</l>
     <l n="134">‘ Twas the hand of Fate , and to-morrow straight</l>
     <l n="135">we would seek the lone moose trail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="136">We watched the groaning ice wrench free , crash on with a hollow din ;</l>
     <l n="137">Men of the wilderness were we , freed from the taint of sin .</l>
     <l n="138">The mighty river snatched us up and it bore us swift along ;</l>
     <l n="139">The days were bright , and the morning light was sweet with jewelled song .</l>
     <l n="140">We poled and lined up nameless streams , portaged o'er hill and plain ;</l>
     <l n="141">We burnt our boat to save the nails , and built our boat again ;</l>
     <l n="142">We guessed and groped , North , ever North , with many a twist and turn ;</l>
     <l n="143">We saw ablaze in the deathless days the splendid sunsets burn .</l>
     <l n="144">O'er soundless lakes where the grayling makes a rush at the clumsy fly ;</l>
     <l n="145">By bluffs so steep that the hard-hit sheep falls sheer from out the sky ;</l>
     <l n="146">By lilied pools where the bull moose cools and wallows in huge content ;</l>
     <l n="147">By rocky lairs where the pig-eyed bears peered at our tiny tent .</l>
     <l n="148">Through the black canyon 's angry foam we hurled to dreamy bars ,</l>
     <l n="149">And round in a ring the dog-nosed peaks bayed to the mocking stars .</l>
     <l n="150">Spring and summer and autumn went ; the sky had a tallow gleam ,</l>
     <l n="151">Yet North and ever North we pressed to the land of our Golden Dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="152">So we came at last to a tundra vast and dark and grim and lone ;</l>
     <l n="153">And there was the little lone moose trail , and we knew it for our own .</l>
     <l n="154">By muskeg hollow and nigger-head it wandered endlessly ;</l>
     <l n="155">Sorry of heart and sore of foot , weary men were we .</l>
     <l n="156">The short-lived sun had a leaden glare and the darkness came too soon ,</l>
     <l n="157">And stationed there with a solemn stare was the pinched , anaemic moon .</l>
     <l n="158">Silence and silvern solitude till it made you dumbly shrink ,</l>
     <l n="159">And you thought to hear with an outward ear</l>
     <l n="160">the things you thought to think .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="161">Oh , it was wild and weird and wan , and ever in camp o ’ nights</l>
     <l n="162">We would watch and watch the silver dance of the mystic Northern Lights .</l>
     <l n="163">And soft they danced from the Polar sky and swept in primrose haze ;</l>
     <l n="164">And swift they pranced with their silver feet ,</l>
     <l n="165">and pierced with a blinding blaze .</l>
     <l n="166">They danced a cotillion in the sky ; they were rose and silver shod ;</l>
     <l n="167">It was not good for the eyes of man — ‘ twas a sight for the eyes of God .</l>
     <l n="168">It made us mad and strange and sad , and the gold whereof we dreamed</l>
     <l n="169">Was all forgot , and our only thought was of the lights that gleamed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="170">Oh , the tundra sponge it was golden brown , and some was a bright blood-red ;</l>
     <l n="171">And the reindeer moss gleamed here and there</l>
     <l n="172">like the tombstones of the dead .</l>
     <l n="173">And in and out and around about the little trail ran clear ,</l>
     <l n="174">And we hated it with a deadly hate and we feared with a deadly fear .</l>
     <l n="175">And the skies of night were alive with light ,</l>
     <l n="176">with a throbbing , thrilling flame ;</l>
     <l n="177">Amber and rose and violet , opal and gold it came .</l>
     <l n="178">It swept the sky like a giant scythe , it quivered back to a wedge ;</l>
     <l n="179">Argently bright , it cleft the night with a wavy golden edge .</l>
     <l n="180">Pennants of silver waved and streamed , lazy banners unfurled ;</l>
     <l n="181">Sudden splendors of sabres gleamed , lightning javelins were hurled .</l>
     <l n="182">There in our awe we crouched and saw with our wild , uplifted eyes</l>
     <l n="183">Charge and retire the hosts of fire in the battlefield of the skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="184">But all things come to an end at last , and the muskeg melted away ,</l>
     <l n="185">And frowning down to bar our path a muddle of mountains lay .</l>
     <l n="186">And a gorge sheered up in granite walls , and the moose trail crept betwixt ;</l>
     <l n="187">‘ Twas as if the earth had gaped too far and her stony jaws were fixt .</l>
     <l n="188">Then the winter fell with a sudden swoop , and the heavy clouds sagged low ,</l>
     <l n="189">And earth and sky were blotted out in a whirl of driving snow .</l>
    </lg>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="276">There was Claw-fingered Kitty and Windy Ike living the life of shame ,</l>
     <l n="277">When unto them in the Long , Long Night came the man-who-had-no-name ;</l>
     <l n="278">Bearing his prize of a black fox pelt , out of the Wild he came .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>His cheeks were blanched as the flume-head foam when the brown spring freshets flow ; Deep in their dark , sin-calcined pits were his sombre eyes aglow ; They knew him far for the fitful man who spat forth blood on the snow .</p>
   <p>“ Did ever you see such a skin ? ” quoth he ; “ there 's nought in the world so fine — Such fullness of fur as black as the night , such lustre , such size , such shine ; It 's life to a one-lunged man like me ; it 's London , it 's women , it 's wine .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The Moose-hides called it the devil-fox , and swore that no man could kill ;</l>
     <l n="2">That he who hunted it , soon or late , must surely suffer some ill ;</l>
     <l n="3">But I laughed at them and their old squaw-tales .</l>
     <l n="4">Ha ! Ha ! I 'm laughing still .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ For look ye , the skin — it 's as smooth as sin , and black as the core of the Pit . By gun or by trap , whatever the hap , I swore I would capture it ; By star and by star afield and afar , I hunted and would not quit .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ For the devil-fox , it was swift and sly , and it seemed to fleer at me ;</l>
     <l n="2">I would wake in fright by the camp-fire light , hearing its evil glee ;</l>
     <l n="3">Into my dream its eyes would gleam , and its shadow would I see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">“ It sniffed and ran from the ptarmigan I had poisoned to excess ;</l>
     <l n="5">Unharmed it sped from my wrathful lead ( ‘ twas as if I shot by guess ) ;</l>
     <l n="6">Yet it came by night in the stark moonlight to mock at my weariness .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I tracked it up where the mountains hunch like the vertebrae of the world ; I tracked it down to the death-still pits where the avalanche is hurled ; From the glooms to the sacerdotal snows , where the carded clouds are curled .</p>
   <p>“ From the vastitudes where the world protrudes through clouds like seas up-shoaled , I held its track till it led me back to the land I had left of old — The land I had looted many moons . I was weary and sick and cold .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I was sick , soul-sick , of the futile chase , and there and then I swore</l>
     <l n="2">The foul fiend fox might scathless go , for I would hunt no more ;</l>
     <l n="3">Then I rubbed mine eyes in a vast surprise — it stood by my cabin door .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ A rifle raised in the wraith-like gloom , and a vengeful shot that sped ; A howl that would thrill a cream-faced corpse — and the demon fox lay dead . . . . Yet there was never a sign of wound , and never a drop he bled .</p>
   <p>“ So that was the end of the great black fox , and here is the prize I 've won ; And now for a drink to cheer me up — I 've mushed since the early sun ; We 'll drink a toast to the sorry ghost of the fox whose race is run . ”</p>

     <l n="3">Or finish me off with a dose of dope — so utterly lost was I .</l>

   <lg>
     <l n="1">Yet they were woefully wicked men , and often at night in pain</l>

   </lg>
   <p>I 'll never forget that bitter dawn , so evil , askew and gray , When they wrapped me round in the skins of beasts and they bore me to a sleigh , And we started out with the nearest post an hundred miles away .</p>
   <p>I 'll never forget the trail they broke , with its tense , unuttered woe ; And the crunch , crunch , crunch as their snowshoes sank through the crust of the hollow snow ; And my breath would fail , and every beat of my heart was like a blow .</p>
   <p>And oftentimes I would die the death , yet wake up to life anew ; The sun would be all ablaze on the waste , and the sky a blighting blue , And the tears would rise in my snow-blind eyes and furrow my cheeks like dew .</p>
   <p>And the camps we made when their strength outplayed and the day was pinched and wan ; And oh , the joy of that blessed halt , and how I did dread the dawn ; And how I hated the weary men who rose and dragged me on .</p>
   <p>And oh , how I begged to rest , to rest — the snow was so sweet a shroud ; And oh , how I cried when they urged me on , cried and cursed them aloud ; Yet on they strained , all racked and pained , and sorely their backs were bowed .</p>
