       <l n="2">O my Author , do you hear the Autumn calling ?</l>
       <l n="3">Does its message fail to reach you in your den ,</l>
       <l n="4">Where the ink that once so sluggishly was crawling</l>
       <l n="5">Courses swiftly through your stylographic pen ?</l>
       <l n="6">‘ Tis the season when the editor grows active ,</l>
       <l n="7">When the office-boy looks longingly to you .</l>
       <l n="8">Wo n't you give him something novel and attractive</l>
       <l n="9">To review ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">Never mind if you are frivolous or solemn ,</l>
       <l n="11">If you only can be striking and unique ,</l>
       <l n="12">The reviewers will concede you half a column</l>
       <l n="13">In their literary journals , any week .</l>
       <l n="14">And ‘ twill always be your publisher 's ambition</l>
       <l n="15">To provide for the demand that you create ,</l>
       <l n="16">And dispose of a gigantic first edition ,</l>
       <l n="17">While you wait .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">O my Author , can n't you pull yourself together ,</l>
       <l n="19">Try to expiate the failures of the past ,</l>
       <l n="20">And just ask yourself dispassionately whether</l>
       <l n="21">You can n't give us something better than your last ?</l>
       <l n="22">If you really — if you truly — are a poet ,</l>

      <head>THE CRY OF THE AUTHOR</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">O my Publisher , how dreadfully you bore me !</l>
       <l n="2">Of your censure I am frankly growing tired .</l>
       <l n="3">With your diatribes eternally before me ,</l>
       <l n="4">How on earth can I expect to feel inspired ?</l>
       <l n="5">You are orderly , no doubt , and systematic ,</l>
       <l n="6">In that office where recumbent you recline ;</l>
       <l n="7">You would modify your methods in an attic</l>
       <l n="8">Such as mine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">If you lived a sort of hand-to-mouth existence</l>
       <l n="10">( Where the mouth found less employment than the hand ) ;</l>
       <l n="11">If your rhymes would lend your humour no assistance ,</l>
       <l n="12">And your wit assumed a form that never scann 'd ;</l>
       <l n="13">If you sat and waited vainly at your table</l>
       <l n="14">While Calliope declined to give her cues ,</l>
       <l n="15">You would realise how very far from stable</l>
       <l n="16">Was the Mews !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">You would find it quite impossible to labour</l>
       <l n="18">With the patient perseverance of a drone ,</l>
       <l n="19">While some tactless but enthusiastic neighbour</l>
       <l n="20">Played a cake walk on a wheezy gramophone ,</l>
       <l n="21">While your peace was so disturbed by constant clatter ,</l>
       <l n="22">That at length you grew accustomed — nay , resigned ,</l>
       <l n="23">To the never-ending victory of Matter</l>
       <l n="24">Over Mind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">While you batten upon plovers ’ eggs and claret ,</l>
       <l n="26">In the shelter of some fashionable club ,</l>
       <l n="27">I am starving , very likely , in a garret ,</l>
       <l n="28">Off the street so incorrectly labelled Grub ,</l>
       <l n="29">Where the vintage smacks distinctly of the ink-butt ,</l>
       <l n="30">And the atmosphere is redolent of toil ,</l>
       <l n="31">And there 's nothing for the journalist to drink but</l>
       <l n="32">Midnight oil !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">It is useless to solicit inspiration</l>
       <l n="34">When one is n't in the true poetic mood ,</l>
       <l n="35">When one contemplates the prospect of starvation ,</l>
       <l n="36">And one 's little ones are clamouring for food .</l>
       <l n="37">When one 's tongue remains ingloriously tacit ,</l>
       <l n="38">One is forced with some reluctance to admit</l>
       <l n="39">That , alas ! ( as Virgil said ) Poeta nascit-</l>
       <l n="40">-Ur , non fit !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="41">Then , my Publisher , be gentle with your poet ;</l>
       <l n="42">Do not treat him with the harshness he deserves ,</l>
       <l n="43">For , in fact , altho ’ you little seem to know it ,</l>
       <l n="44">You are gradually getting on his nerves .</l>
       <l n="45">Kindly dam the foaming torrent of your curses ,</l>
       <l n="46">While I ask you ,— yes , and pause for a reply ,—</l>
       <l n="47">Are you writing this immortal book of verses ,</l>
       <l n="48">Or am I ?</l>
