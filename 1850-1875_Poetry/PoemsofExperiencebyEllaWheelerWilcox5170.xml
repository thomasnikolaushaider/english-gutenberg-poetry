     <head>THE EMPTY BOWL</head>
     <lg>
       <l n="2">I held the golden vessel of my soul</l>
       <l n="3">And prayed that God would fill it from on high .</l>
       <l n="4">Day after day the importuning cry</l>
       <l n="5">Grew stronger — grew , a heaven-accusing dole</l>
       <l n="6">Because no sacred waters laved my bowl .</l>
       <l n="7">‘ So full the fountain , Lord , wouldst Thou deny</l>
       <l n="8">The little needed for a soul 's supply ?</l>
       <l n="9">I ask but this small portion of Thy whole . ’</l>
       <l n="10">Then from the vast invisible Somewhere ,</l>
       <l n="11">A voice , as one love-authorised by Him ,</l>
       <l n="12">Spake , and the tumult of my heart was stilled .</l>
       <l n="13">‘ Who wants the waters must the bowl prepare ;</l>
       <l n="14">Pour out the self , that chokes it to the brim ,</l>
       <l n="15">But emptied vessels , from the source are filled . ’</l>

       <l n="3">Here in my cosy corner ,</l>
       <l n="4">Before a blazing log ,</l>
       <l n="5">I 'm thinking of cold London</l>
       <l n="6">Wrapped in its killing fog ;</l>
       <l n="7">And , like a shining beacon</l>
       <l n="8">Above the picture grim ,</l>
       <l n="9">I see the London ‘ Bobby , ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">I see his stalwart figure ,</l>

       <l n="14">At any hour or place .</l>
       <l n="15">For , though you seek some by-way</l>
       <l n="16">Long miles from his own beat ,</l>
       <l n="17">He tells you all about it ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">He looks like some bold Viking ,</l>

       <l n="21">Yet in his voice lies feeling ,</l>
       <l n="22">And in his eye lies peace ;</l>

       <l n="1">The Radiant Rulers of Mystic Regions</l>
       <l n="2">Where souls of artists are fitted for birth</l>
       <l n="3">Gathered together their lovely legions</l>
       <l n="4">And fashioned a woman to shine on earth .</l>
       <l n="5">They bathed her in splendour ,</l>
       <l n="6">They made her tender ,</l>
       <l n="7">They gave her a nature both sweet and wild ;</l>
       <l n="8">They gave her emotions like storm-stirred oceans ,</l>
       <l n="9">And they gave her the heart of a little child .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">These Radiant Rulers ( who are not human</l>
       <l n="11">Nor yet divine like the gods above )</l>
       <l n="12">Poured all their gifts in the soul of woman ,</l>
       <l n="13">That fragile vessel meant only for love .</l>
       <l n="14">Still more they taught her ,</l>
       <l n="15">Still more they brought her ,</l>
       <l n="16">Till they gave her the world for a harp one day :</l>
       <l n="17">And they bade her string it ,</l>
       <l n="18">They bade her ring it ,</l>
       <l n="19">While the stars all wondered to hear her play .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="20">She touched the strings in a master fashion ,</l>
       <l n="21">She uttered the cry of a world 's despair :</l>
       <l n="22">Its long hid secret , its pent-up passion ,</l>
       <l n="23">She gave to the winds in a vibrant air .</l>
       <l n="24">For oh ! the heart of her ,</l>
       <l n="25">That was the art of her .</l>
       <l n="26">Great with the feeling that makes men kin .</l>
       <l n="27">Art unapproachable ,</l>
       <l n="28">Art all uncoachable ,</l>
       <l n="29">Fragrance and flame from the spirit within .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="30">The earth turns ever an ear unheeding</l>
       <l n="31">To the sorrows of art , as it cries ‘ encore . ’</l>
       <l n="32">And she played on the harp till her hands were bleeding ,</l>
       <l n="33">And her brow was bruised by the laurels she wore .</l>
       <l n="34">She knew the trend of it ,</l>
       <l n="35">She knew the end of it -</l>
       <l n="36">Men heard the music and men felt the thrill .</l>
       <l n="37">Bound to the altar</l>
       <l n="38">Of art , could she falter ?</l>
       <l n="39">Then came a silence — the music was still .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="40">And yet in the echoes we seem to hear it ;</l>
       <l n="41">In waves unbroken it circles the earth :</l>
       <l n="42">And we catch in the light of her dauntless spirit</l>
       <l n="43">A gleam from the centre that gave her birth .</l>
       <l n="44">Still is the fame of her</l>
       <l n="45">Felt in the name of her -</l>
       <l n="46">But low lies the harp that once thrilled to her strain ;</l>
       <l n="47">No hand has taken it ,</l>
       <l n="48">No hand can waken it -</l>
       <l n="49">For the soul of her art was her secret of pain .</l>

       <l n="5">‘ Now whither away ’ — called one of the ghosts ,</l>

     <head>THE WHITE MAN</head>
     <p>Wherever the white man 's feet have trod ( Oh far does the white man stray ) A bold road rifles the virginal sod , And the forest wakes out of its dream of God , To yield him the right of way . For this is the law : BY THE POWER OF THOUGHT , FOR WORSE , OR FOR BETTER , ARE MIRACLES WROUGHT .</p>
     <p>Wherever the white man 's pathway leads , ( Far , far has that pathway gone ) The Earth is littered with broken creeds -  And alway the dark man 's tent recedes , And the white man pushes on . For this is the law : BE IT GOOD OR ILL , ALL THINGS MUST YIELD TO THE STRONGER WILL .</p>
     <p>Wherever the white man 's light is shed , ( Oh far has that light been thrown ) Though Nature has suffered and beauty bled , Yet the goal of the race has been thrust ahead , And the might of the race has grown . For this is the law : BE IT CRUEL OR KIND , THE UNIVERSE SWAYS TO THE POWER OF MIND .</p>

      <head>CHRIST CRUCIFIED</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Now ere I slept , my prayer had been that I might see my way</l>
       <l n="2">To do the will of Christ , our Lord and Master , day by day ;</l>
       <l n="3">And with this prayer upon my lips , I knew not that I dreamed ,</l>
       <l n="4">But suddenly the world of night a pandemonium seemed .</l>
       <l n="5">From forest , and from slaughter house , from bull ring , and from</l>
       <l n="6">stall ,</l>
       <l n="7">There rose an anguished cry of pain , a loud , appealing call ;</l>
       <l n="8">As man — the dumb beast 's next of kin — with gun , and whip , and knife ,</l>
       <l n="9">Went pleasure-seeking through the earth , blood-bent on taking life .</l>
       <l n="10">From trap , and cage , and house , and zoo , and street , that awful</l>
       <l n="11">strain</l>
       <l n="12">Of tortured creatures rose and swelled the orchestra of pain .</l>
       <l n="13">And then methought the gentle Christ appeared to me , and spoke :</l>
       <l n="14">‘ I called you , but ye answered not ’ — and in my fear I woke .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">Then next I heard the roar of mills ; and moving through the noise ,</l>
       <l n="16">Like phantoms in an underworld , were little girls and boys .</l>
       <l n="17">Their backs were bent , their brows were pale , their eyes were sad and</l>
       <l n="18">old ;</l>
       <l n="19">But by the labour of their hands greed added gold to gold .</l>
       <l n="20">Again the Presence and the Voice : ‘ Behold the crimes I see ,</l>
       <l n="21">As ye have done it unto these , so have ye done to me . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="22">Again I slept . I seemed to climb a hard , ascending track ;</l>
       <l n="23">And just behind me laboured one whose patient face was black .</l>
       <l n="24">I pitied him ; but hour by hour he gained upon the path ;</l>
       <l n="25">He stood beside me , stood upright — and then I turned in wrath .</l>
       <l n="26">‘ Go back ! ’ I cried . ‘ What right have you to walk beside me here ?</l>
       <l n="27">For you are black , and I am white . ’ I paused , struck dumb with fear .</l>
       <l n="28">For lo ! the black man was not there , but Christ stood in his place ;</l>
       <l n="29">And oh ! the pain , the pain , the pain that looked from that dear face .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="30">Now when I woke , the air was rife with that sweet , rhythmic din</l>
       <l n="31">Which tells the world that Christ has come to save mankind from sin .</l>
       <l n="32">And through the open door of church and temple passed a throng ,</l>
       <l n="33">To worship Him with bended knee , with sermon , and with song .</l>
       <l n="34">But over all I heard the cry of hunted , mangled things ;</l>
       <l n="35">Those creatures which are part of God , though they have hoofs and</l>
       <l n="36">wings .</l>
       <l n="37">I saw in mill , and mine , and shop , the little slaves of greed ;</l>
       <l n="38">I heard the strife of race with race , all sprung from one God-seed .</l>
       <l n="39">And then I bowed my head in shame , and in contrition cried -</l>
       <l n="40">‘ Lo , after nineteen hundred years , Christ still is Crucified . ’</l>

     <head>THE NEW HAWAIIAN GIRL</head>
     <head>EXPLANATORY</head>
     <p>Kamehameha First , of the Hawaiian Islands , conquered his foes in a great battle , driving them over the high mountain peak known as Pali - - one of the famous scenic views of the world , and the goal of all visitors in Honolulu .</p>
     <p>The Hula ( pronounced hoola ) was the national muscle and abdominal dance of Hawaii , and the late King Kalakua was its enthusiastic patron . The costume of the dancers was composed chiefly of skirts of grass . The Hula ( so attired ) is now forbidden by law . The Hula Kui is a modification of the dance and exceedingly graceful .</p>
     <p>Many charming young self-supporting woman in Honolulu trace their ancestry back to Kamehameha with great pride . The chant is a weird sing-song which relates the conquests of the race .</p>
     <p>It is the custom in Honolulu to present guests at feasts and festivals , or departing visitors , with long wreaths of natural flowers , and which are worn by men , as well as women , about the head , hat , and neck . These wreaths , called lais ( pronounced lays ) , sometimes reach below the waist .</p>
     <p>The flower-sellers are one of the national features of Honolulu .</p>
     <p>Scene made to represent grounds at Hawaiian hotel . Sort of open cafe or pavilion with palms , vines , and tropic flowers . RALPH sitting alone with a dreamy air .</p>
     <p>Enter ETHEL — in short travelling suit — typical American girl — blonde and petite .</p>
