       <l n="2">It is n't just colors and bunting —</l>
       <l n="3">The red and the blue and the white .</l>
       <l n="4">It 's something heaps better and finer ,—</l>
       <l n="5">It 's the soul of my country in sight !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">There 's a lot of ceremony ‘ bout the Flag ,</l>
       <l n="7">Though many half-baked patriots believe</l>
       <l n="8">Salutin ’ it and hangin ’ it correct</l>
       <l n="9">“ Is only loyalty upon the sleeve . ”</l>
       <l n="10">But we who work beneath the Flag to-day ,</l>
       <l n="11">Who 'll honor it — and die for it , perhaps —</l>
       <l n="12">Get a slightly different view of the old red , white and blue</l>
       <l n="13">Than is visioned by th ’ criticisin ’ chaps .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">It is n't just for decoratin ’ things ,</l>
       <l n="15">It is n't just an emblem , clean and bright ,</l>
       <l n="16">No matter what its “ hoist ” or what its “ fly , ”</l>
       <l n="17">To us it means our country — wrong or right !</l>
       <l n="18">The sobby stuff that some good people spout</l>
       <l n="19">Wo n't help a man to understand this view ,</l>
       <l n="20">But : Wherever that Flag goes , the man who follows , knows</l>
       <l n="21">That a better , cleaner citizen goes too !</l>

      <head>LOYALTY</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">This is no time to quibble or to fool ;</l>
       <l n="2">To argue over who was wrong , who right ;</l>
       <l n="3">To measure fealty with a worn foot-rule ;</l>
       <l n="4">To ask : “ Shall we keep still or shall we fight ? ”</l>
       <l n="5">The Clock of Fate has struck ; the hour is here ;</l>
       <l n="6">War is upon us now — not far away ;</l>
       <l n="7">One question only rises , clarion clear :</l>
       <l n="8">“ How may I serve my country , day by day ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Not all of us may join the khakied throng</l>
       <l n="10">Of those who answer and go forth to stem</l>
       <l n="11">The tide of war . But we can all be strong</l>
       <l n="12">And steady in our loyalty to them !</l>
       <l n="13">Not with unfettered thought , or tongue let loose</l>
       <l n="14">In bitterness and hate — a childish game !</l>
       <l n="15">But with a faith , untroubled by abuse ,</l>
       <l n="16">That honors those who put the rest to shame !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">There is no middle ground on which to stand ;</l>
       <l n="18">We 've done with useless pro-and-con debates ;</l>
       <l n="19">The one-time friend , so welcome in this land ,</l>
       <l n="20">Has turned upon us at our very gates .</l>
       <l n="21">There is no way , with honor , to stand back —</l>
       <l n="22">Real patriotism is n't cool — then hot ;</l>
       <l n="23">You cannot trim the flag to fit your lack ;</l>
       <l n="24">You are American — or else you 're not !</l>

      <head>THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">You pull a lot of funny stuff about us , when there 's peace ,</l>
       <l n="2">The jokes you spring are sometimes rough , and make a guy see red ;</l>
       <l n="3">But when there 's trouble in the air you “ vaudevillians ” cease ,</l>
       <l n="4">And them that laughed the loudest laugh , salute the flag instead !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Oh , it 's kid the boys along</l>
       <l n="6">When there 's nothing going wrong ;</l>
       <l n="7">But when your country 's facin ’ war ,</l>
       <l n="8">You sing a different song !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">The khaki that they doll us in ai n't seen war service — no !</l>
       <l n="10">The most of it has been worn thin a-loafin ’ ‘ round the mess ;</l>
       <l n="11">Folks think it 's great to josh us when things are goin ’ slow ,</l>
       <l n="12">But when the country 's all het up — we ai n't so worse , I guess !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Then it 's , “ Look ! The Guard is here ;</l>
       <l n="14">Fine set of men , muh dear . ” ...</l>
       <l n="15">( We 'd like it better if you spread</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">We 're only folks — th ’ reg'lar kind — that answered to th ’ call ;</l>
       <l n="18">We may be dumb and also blind — but still we 'll see it through !</l>
       <l n="19">Just wearin ’ khaki does n't change our insides — not a'tall !</l>
       <l n="20">We 're human ( Does that seem so strange ? ) waitin ’ to fight — for you !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">We may n't be worth a cuss</l>
       <l n="22">In this ugly foreign muss ,</l>
       <l n="23">But when the nation needs some help ,</l>
       <l n="24">Why — pass the job to us !</l>

      <head>THE ALIEN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">( Of course , this did n't happen ,</l>
       <l n="2">But if it had —</l>
       <l n="3">Would you have been shocked ? )</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">She was a pretty little thing ,</l>
       <l n="5">Round-headed , bronze-haired and trim</l>
       <l n="6">As a yacht .</l>
       <l n="7">And when she married a handsome , polished Prussian</l>
       <l n="8">( Before the war was ours )</l>
       <l n="9">Her friends all said</l>
       <l n="10">She 'd made no mistake .</l>
       <l n="11">He had much money , and he was n't arrogant —</l>
       <l n="12">To her .</l>
       <l n="13">Their baby came —</l>
       <l n="14">Big and blue-eyed ,</l>
       <l n="15">Solemn and serious ,</l>
       <l n="16">With his father 's arrogance in the small .</l>
       <l n="17">She knew how wonderful a child he was</l>
       <l n="18">And said so .</l>
       <l n="19">The husband knew it , too —</l>
       <l n="20">Because the child looked like him ,</l>
       <l n="21">And they were happy</l>
       <l n="22">Until the Nation roused itself ,</l>
       <l n="23">Stretched and yawned</l>
       <l n="24">And got into the hellish game of kill .</l>
       <l n="25">Then the man ,</l>
       <l n="26">Who had been almost human ,</l>
       <l n="27">Dropped his mask ,</l>
       <l n="28">And uncovered his ragged soul .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="29">Having no sense of right or wrong —</l>
       <l n="30">No spiritual standards for measurements ;</l>
       <l n="31">Feeding upon that same egotism</l>
       <l n="32">That swept his country</l>
       <l n="33">Into the depths of hate —</l>
       <l n="34">He sneered and laughed</l>
       <l n="35">At her pale patriotism</l>
       <l n="36">And the country that inspired it .</l>
       <l n="37">There was no open break between them ,</l>
       <l n="38">For a child 's small hands</l>
       <l n="39">Clung to both and kept them close .</l>
       <l n="40">Shutting her eyes to all else</l>
       <l n="41">Save that she was his wife ,</l>
       <l n="42">She played her part well .</l>
       <l n="43">His work — his bluff at work , instead —</l>
       <l n="44">Was something big and important</l>
       <l n="45">( Always he looked the importance )</l>
       <l n="46">That had to do with ships —</l>
       <l n="47">Ships that idled at their docks to-day</l>
       <l n="48">Because they were interned .</l>
       <l n="49">And there was always money —</l>
       <l n="50">More money than she had ever known ,—</l>
       <l n="51">Which he lavished — on himself</l>
       <l n="52">And his desires .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="53">Not that he gave her nothing ,</l>
       <l n="54">For he did ....</l>
       <l n="55">They lived in a big hotel ,</l>
       <l n="56">And the child had everything it should have</l>
       <l n="57">And much it should not .</l>
       <l n="58">She , too , was cared for well ,</l>
       <l n="59">After his wants were satisfied .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="60">Then —</l>
       <l n="61">The silent blow fell .</l>
       <l n="62">Secret service men called upon him ,</l>
       <l n="63">And next day he was taken away</l>
       <l n="64">To a detention camp</l>
       <l n="65">For alien enemies .</l>
       <l n="66">Interned like the anchor-chafing ships</l>
       <l n="67">That once had flown his flag !</l>
       <l n="68">The woman , up in arms , dinned at officials</l>
       <l n="69">Until ( so easy-going and so slow to learn )</l>
       <l n="70">They told her what he had done .</l>
       <l n="71">That night she stared long at their child , asleep ,</l>
       <l n="72">And at its father 's picture ,</l>
       <l n="73">On her dresser ....</l>
       <l n="74">Did the wife-courage that transcends</l>
       <l n="75">All other kinds of bravery</l>
       <l n="76">Keep her awake for hours ,</l>
       <l n="77">Planning , scheming , thinking ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="78">A week later she and the child —</l>
       <l n="79">A blue-eyed , self-assertive mite —</l>
       <l n="80">Were at the camp ,</l>
       <l n="81">She carrying it ( the nurse was left behind )</l>
       <l n="82">And the passports that allowed her to see him</l>
       <l n="83">One hour , with a guard five yards away .</l>
       <l n="84">Some of his polite impudence was gone ,</l>
       <l n="85">Yet he threw back his head and shoulders</l>
       <l n="86">And shrugged as his wife and boy came in .</l>
       <l n="87">“ Always late , ” said he , after a perfunctory kiss ,</l>
       <l n="88">“ You — and your country ! ”</l>
       <l n="89">She stared long at him , holding the child close ,</l>
       <l n="90">Her own round , bronze head bowed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="91">Then , with a swift glance at the guard</l>
       <l n="92">Thoughtfully chewing a straw and looking</l>
       <l n="93">At the city of shacks ,</l>
       <l n="94">She spoke .</l>
       <l n="95">“ Did you know , Karl , ” she whispered ,</l>
       <l n="96">“ That my brother was on that transport —</l>
       <l n="97">My only brother — a soldier — my only blood ?</l>
       <l n="98">If it had gone down — that transport — been sunk — ”</l>
       <l n="99">“ Well ? ” said he . That was all .</l>
       <l n="100">“ My brother — my only — Karl ! ”</l>
       <l n="101">“ Well ? ” said he again . “ What of it ? ”</l>
       <l n="102">Then — her little head lifted , her eyes gone mad —</l>
       <l n="103">“ This ! ” she said . “ Rather than give</l>
       <l n="104">Life to another human scorpion like you —</l>
       <l n="105">Man in form only !— Lower than the floor of hell itself ;</l>
       <l n="106">Rather than have my blood mingle with</l>
       <l n="107">The foul poison that is yours ,</l>
       <l n="108">To make a child of ours —</l>
       <l n="109">This : I give him back to you —</l>
       <l n="110">And recall my love — all of my love ! ”</l>
       <l n="111">Again he shrugged his shoulders ,</l>
       <l n="112">Yawned — and saw , too late .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="113">Swift as the eagle that drives a lamb to death</l>
       <l n="114">She whipped a hat-pin from her dainty hat ,</l>
       <l n="115">Drove it with steady aim</l>
       <l n="116">Into the baby 's heart</l>
       <l n="117">And handed back to the gulping man</l>
       <l n="118">All that was left of what had once meant joy —</l>
       <l n="119">A dead baby with red bubbles on its lips !</l>
