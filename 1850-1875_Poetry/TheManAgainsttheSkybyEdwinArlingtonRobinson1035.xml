   <p>Flammonde</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The man Flammonde , from God knows where ,</l>
     <l n="2">With firm address and foreign air ,</l>
     <l n="3">With news of nations in his talk</l>
     <l n="4">And something royal in his walk ,</l>
     <l n="5">With glint of iron in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="6">But never doubt , nor yet surprise ,</l>
     <l n="7">Appeared , and stayed , and held his head</l>
     <l n="8">As one by kings accredited .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Erect , with his alert repose</l>
     <l n="10">About him , and about his clothes ,</l>
     <l n="11">He pictured all tradition hears</l>
     <l n="12">Of what we owe to fifty years .</l>
     <l n="13">His cleansing heritage of taste</l>
     <l n="14">Paraded neither want nor waste ;</l>
     <l n="15">And what he needed for his fee</l>
     <l n="16">To live , he borrowed graciously .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">He never told us what he was ,</l>
     <l n="18">Or what mischance , or other cause ,</l>
     <l n="19">Had banished him from better days</l>
     <l n="20">To play the Prince of Castaways .</l>
     <l n="21">Meanwhile he played surpassing well</l>
     <l n="22">A part , for most , unplayable ;</l>
     <l n="23">In fine , one pauses , half afraid</l>
     <l n="24">To say for certain that he played .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">For that , one may as well forego</l>
     <l n="26">Conviction as to yes or no ;</l>
     <l n="27">Nor can I say just how intense</l>
     <l n="28">Would then have been the difference</l>
     <l n="29">To several , who , having striven</l>
     <l n="30">In vain to get what he was given ,</l>
     <l n="31">Would see the stranger taken on</l>
     <l n="32">By friends not easy to be won .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Moreover , many a malcontent</l>
     <l n="34">He soothed and found munificent ;</l>
     <l n="35">His courtesy beguiled and foiled</l>
     <l n="36">Suspicion that his years were soiled ;</l>
     <l n="37">His mien distinguished any crowd ,</l>
     <l n="38">His credit strengthened when he bowed ;</l>
     <l n="39">And women , young and old , were fond</l>
     <l n="40">Of looking at the man Flammonde .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">There was a woman in our town</l>
     <l n="42">On whom the fashion was to frown ;</l>
     <l n="43">But while our talk renewed the tinge</l>
     <l n="44">Of a long-faded scarlet fringe ,</l>
     <l n="45">The man Flammonde saw none of that ,</l>
     <l n="46">And what he saw we wondered at —</l>
     <l n="47">That none of us , in her distress ,</l>
     <l n="48">Could hide or find our littleness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">There was a boy that all agreed</l>
     <l n="50">Had shut within him the rare seed</l>
     <l n="51">Of learning . We could understand ,</l>
     <l n="52">But none of us could lift a hand .</l>
     <l n="53">The man Flammonde appraised the youth ,</l>
     <l n="54">And told a few of us the truth ;</l>
     <l n="55">And thereby , for a little gold ,</l>
     <l n="56">A flowered future was unrolled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">There were two citizens who fought</l>
     <l n="58">For years and years , and over nought ;</l>
     <l n="59">They made life awkward for their friends ,</l>
     <l n="60">And shortened their own dividends .</l>
     <l n="61">The man Flammonde said what was wrong</l>
     <l n="62">Should be made right ; nor was it long</l>
     <l n="63">Before they were again in line ,</l>
     <l n="64">And had each other in to dine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">And these I mention are but four</l>
     <l n="66">Of many out of many more .</l>
     <l n="67">So much for them . But what of him —</l>
     <l n="68">So firm in every look and limb ?</l>
     <l n="69">What small satanic sort of kink</l>
     <l n="70">Was in his brain ? What broken link</l>
     <l n="71">Withheld him from the destinies</l>
     <l n="72">That came so near to being his ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">What was he , when we came to sift</l>
     <l n="74">His meaning , and to note the drift</l>
     <l n="75">Of incommunicable ways</l>
     <l n="76">That make us ponder while we praise ?</l>
     <l n="77">Why was it that his charm revealed</l>
     <l n="78">Somehow the surface of a shield ?</l>
     <l n="79">What was it that we never caught ?</l>
     <l n="80">What was he , and what was he not ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="81">How much it was of him we met</l>
     <l n="82">We cannot ever know ; nor yet</l>
     <l n="83">Shall all he gave us quite atone</l>
     <l n="84">For what was his , and his alone ;</l>
     <l n="85">Nor need we now , since he knew best ,</l>
     <l n="86">Nourish an ethical unrest :</l>
     <l n="87">Rarely at once will nature give</l>
     <l n="88">The power to be Flammonde and live .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="89">We cannot know how much we learn</l>
     <l n="90">From those who never will return ,</l>
     <l n="91">Until a flash of unforeseen</l>
     <l n="92">Remembrance falls on what has been .</l>
     <l n="93">We 've each a darkening hill to climb ;</l>
     <l n="94">And this is why , from time to time</l>
     <l n="95">In Tilbury Town , we look beyond</l>
     <l n="96">Horizons for the man Flammonde .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="97">The Gift of God</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="98">Blessed with a joy that only she</l>
     <l n="99">Of all alive shall ever know ,</l>
     <l n="100">She wears a proud humility</l>
     <l n="101">For what it was that willed it so ,—</l>
     <l n="102">That her degree should be so great</l>
     <l n="103">Among the favored of the Lord</l>
     <l n="104">That she may scarcely bear the weight</l>
     <l n="105">Of her bewildering reward .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="106">As one apart , immune , alone ,</l>
     <l n="107">Or featured for the shining ones ,</l>
     <l n="108">And like to none that she has known</l>
     <l n="109">Of other women 's other sons ,—</l>
     <l n="110">The firm fruition of her need ,</l>
     <l n="111">He shines anointed ; and he blurs</l>
     <l n="112">Her vision , till it seems indeed</l>
     <l n="113">A sacrilege to call him hers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="114">She fears a little for so much</l>
     <l n="115">Of what is best , and hardly dares</l>
     <l n="116">To think of him as one to touch</l>
     <l n="117">With aches , indignities , and cares ;</l>
     <l n="118">She sees him rather at the goal ,</l>
     <l n="119">Still shining ; and her dream foretells</l>
     <l n="120">The proper shining of a soul</l>
     <l n="121">Where nothing ordinary dwells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="122">Perchance a canvass of the town</l>
     <l n="123">Would find him far from flags and shouts ,</l>
     <l n="124">And leave him only the renown</l>
     <l n="125">Of many smiles and many doubts ;</l>
     <l n="126">Perchance the crude and common tongue</l>
     <l n="127">Would havoc strangely with his worth ;</l>
     <l n="128">But she , with innocence unwrung ,</l>
     <l n="129">Would read his name around the earth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="130">And others , knowing how this youth</l>
     <l n="131">Would shine , if love could make him great ,</l>
     <l n="132">When caught and tortured for the truth</l>
     <l n="133">Would only writhe and hesitate ;</l>
     <l n="134">While she , arranging for his days</l>
     <l n="135">What centuries could not fulfill ,</l>
     <l n="136">Transmutes him with her faith and praise ,</l>
     <l n="137">And has him shining where she will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="138">She crowns him with her gratefulness ,</l>
     <l n="139">And says again that life is good ;</l>
     <l n="140">And should the gift of God be less</l>
     <l n="141">In him than in her motherhood ,</l>
     <l n="142">His fame , though vague , will not be small ,</l>
     <l n="143">As upward through her dream he fares ,</l>
     <l n="144">Half clouded with a crimson fall</l>
     <l n="145">Of roses thrown on marble stairs .</l>
    </lg>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="92">
     <l n="498">You are a friend then , as I make it out ,</l>
     <l n="499">Of our man Shakespeare , who alone of us</l>
     <l n="500">Will put an ass 's head in Fairyland</l>
     <l n="501">As he would add a shilling to more shillings ,</l>
     <l n="502">All most harmonious ,— and out of his</l>
     <l n="503">Miraculous inviolable increase</l>
     <l n="504">Fills Ilion , Rome , or any town you like</l>
     <l n="505">Of olden time with timeless Englishmen ;</l>
     <l n="506">And I must wonder what you think of him —</l>
     <l n="507">All you down there where your small Avon flows</l>
     <l n="508">By Stratford , and where you 're an Alderman .</l>
     <l n="509">Some , for a guess , would have him riding back</l>
     <l n="510">To be a farrier there , or say a dyer ;</l>
     <l n="511">Or maybe one of your adept surveyors ;</l>
     <l n="512">Or like enough the wizard of all tanners .</l>
     <l n="513">Not you — no fear of that ; for I discern</l>
     <l n="514">In you a kindling of the flame that saves —</l>
     <l n="515">The nimble element , the true phlogiston ;</l>
     <l n="516">I see it , and was told of it , moreover ,</l>
     <l n="517">By our discriminate friend himself , no other .</l>
     <l n="518">Had you been one of the sad average ,</l>
     <l n="519">As he would have it ,— meaning , as I take it ,</l>
     <l n="520">The sinew and the solvent of our Island ,</l>
     <l n="521">You 'd not be buying beer for this Terpander 's</l>
     <l n="522">Approved and estimated friend Ben Jonson ;</l>
     <l n="523">He 'd never foist it as a part of his</l>
     <l n="524">Contingent entertainment of a townsman</l>
     <l n="525">While he goes off rehearsing , as he must ,</l>
     <l n="526">If he shall ever be the Duke of Stratford .</l>
     <l n="527">And my words are no shadow on your town —</l>
     <l n="528">Far from it ; for one town 's as like another</l>
     <l n="529">As all are unlike London . Oh , he knows it ,—</l>
     <l n="530">And there 's the Stratford in him ; he denies it ,</l>
     <l n="531">And there 's the Shakespeare in him . So , God help him !</l>
     <l n="532">I tell him he needs Greek ; but neither God</l>
     <l n="533">Nor Greek will help him . Nothing will help that man .</l>
     <l n="534">You see the fates have given him so much ,</l>
     <l n="535">He must have all or perish ,— or look out</l>
     <l n="536">Of London , where he sees too many lords ;</l>
     <l n="537">They 're part of half what ails him : I suppose</l>
     <l n="538">There 's nothing fouler down among the demons</l>
     <l n="539">Than what it is he feels when he remembers</l>
     <l n="540">The dust and sweat and ointment of his calling</l>
     <l n="541">With his lords looking on and laughing at him .</l>
     <l n="542">King as he is , he can n't be king de facto ,</l>
     <l n="543">And that 's as well , because he would n't like it ;</l>
     <l n="544">He 'd frame a lower rating of men then</l>
     <l n="545">Than he has now ; and after that would come</l>
     <l n="546">An abdication or an apoplexy .</l>
     <l n="547">He can n't be king , not even king of Stratford ,—</l>
     <l n="548">Though half the world , if not the whole of it ,</l>
     <l n="549">May crown him with a crown that fits no king</l>
     <l n="550">Save Lord Apollo 's homesick emissary :</l>
     <l n="551">Not there on Avon , or on any stream</l>
     <l n="552">Where Naiads and their white arms are no more ,</l>
     <l n="553">Shall he find home again . It 's all too bad .</l>
     <l n="554">But there 's a comfort , for he 'll have that House —</l>
     <l n="555">The best you ever saw ; and he 'll be there</l>
     <l n="556">Anon , as you 're an Alderman . Good God !</l>
     <l n="557">He makes me lie awake o ’ nights and laugh .</l>
     <l n="558">And you have known him from his origin ,</l>
     <l n="559">You tell me ; and a most uncommon urchin</l>
     <l n="560">He must have been to the few seeing ones —</l>
     <l n="561">A trifle terrifying , I dare say ,</l>
     <l n="562">Discovering a world with his man 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="563">Quite as another lad might see some finches ,</l>
     <l n="564">If he looked hard and had an eye for nature .</l>
     <l n="565">But this one had his eyes and their foretelling ,</l>
     <l n="566">And he had you to fare with , and what else ?</l>
     <l n="567">He must have had a father and a mother —</l>
     <l n="568">In fact I 've heard him say so — and a dog ,</l>
     <l n="569">As a boy should , I venture ; and the dog ,</l>
     <l n="570">Most likely , was the only man who knew him .</l>
     <l n="571">A dog , for all I know , is what he needs</l>
     <l n="572">As much as anything right here to-day ,</l>
     <l n="573">To counsel him about his disillusions ,</l>
     <l n="574">Old aches , and parturitions of what 's coming ,—</l>
     <l n="575">A dog of orders , an emeritus ,</l>
     <l n="576">To wag his tail at him when he comes home ,</l>
     <l n="577">And then to put his paws up on his knees</l>
     <l n="578">And say , “ For God 's sake , what 's it all about ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="93">
     <l n="579">I do n't know whether he needs a dog or not —</l>
     <l n="580">Or what he needs . I tell him he needs Greek ;</l>
     <l n="581">I 'll talk of rules and Aristotle with him ,</l>
     <l n="582">And if his tongue 's at home he 'll say to that ,</l>
     <l n="583">“ I have your word that Aristotle knows ,</l>
     <l n="584">And you mine that I do n't know Aristotle . ”</l>
     <l n="585">He 's all at odds with all the unities ,</l>
     <l n="586">And what 's yet worse , it does n't seem to matter ;</l>
     <l n="587">He treads along through Time 's old wilderness</l>
     <l n="588">As if the tramp of all the centuries</l>
     <l n="589">Had left no roads — and there are none , for him ;</l>
     <l n="590">He does n't see them , even with those eyes ,—</l>
     <l n="591">And that 's a pity , or I say it is .</l>
     <l n="592">Accordingly we have him as we have him —</l>
     <l n="593">Going his way , the way that he goes best ,</l>
     <l n="594">A pleasant animal with no great noise</l>
     <l n="595">Or nonsense anywhere to set him off —</l>
     <l n="596">Save only divers and inclement devils</l>
     <l n="597">Have made of late his heart their dwelling place .</l>
     <l n="598">A flame half ready to fly out sometimes</l>
     <l n="599">At some annoyance may be fanned up in him ,</l>
     <l n="600">But soon it falls , and when it falls goes out ;</l>
     <l n="601">He knows how little room there is in there</l>
     <l n="602">For crude and futile animosities ,</l>
     <l n="603">And how much for the joy of being whole ,</l>
     <l n="604">And how much for long sorrow and old pain .</l>
     <l n="605">On our side there are some who may be given</l>
     <l n="606">To grow old wondering what he thinks of us</l>
     <l n="607">And some above us , who are , in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="608">Above himself ,— and that 's quite right and English .</l>
     <l n="609">Yet here we smile , or disappoint the gods</l>
     <l n="610">Who made it so : the gods have always eyes</l>
     <l n="611">To see men scratch ; and they see one down here</l>
     <l n="612">Who itches , manor-bitten to the bone ,</l>
     <l n="613">Albeit he knows himself — yes , yes , he knows —</l>
     <l n="614">The lord of more than England and of more</l>
     <l n="615">Than all the seas of England in all time</l>
     <l n="616">Shall ever wash. D'ye wonder that I laugh ?</l>
     <l n="617">He sees me , and he does n't seem to care ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="94">
     <l n="619">I 'll meet him out alone of a bright Sunday ,</l>
     <l n="620">Trim , rather spruce , and quite the gentleman .</l>
     <l n="621">“ What ho , my lord ! ” say I . He does n't hear me ;</l>
     <l n="622">Wherefore I have to pause and look at him .</l>
     <l n="623">He 's not enormous , but one looks at him .</l>
     <l n="624">A little on the round if you insist ,</l>
     <l n="625">For now , God save the mark , he 's growing old ;</l>
     <l n="626">He 's five and forty , and to hear him talk</l>
     <l n="627">These days you 'd call him eighty ; then you 'd add</l>
     <l n="628">More years to that . He 's old enough to be</l>

     <l n="630">“ Ben , you 're a scholar , what 's the time of day ? ”</l>

     <l n="632">An aged light that has no age or station —</l>
     <l n="633">The mystery that 's his — a mischievous</l>
     <l n="634">Half-mad serenity that laughs at fame</l>
     <l n="635">For being won so easy , and at friends</l>
     <l n="636">Who laugh at him for what he wants the most ,</l>
     <l n="637">And for his dukedom down in Warwickshire ;—</l>
     <l n="638">By which you see we 're all a little jealous ....</l>
     <l n="639">Poor Greene ! I fear the color of his name</l>
     <l n="640">Was even as that of his ascending soul ;</l>
     <l n="641">And he was one where there are many others ,—</l>
     <l n="642">Some scrivening to the end against their fate ,</l>
     <l n="643">Their puppets all in ink and all to die there ;</l>
     <l n="644">And some with hands that once would shade an eye</l>
     <l n="645">That scanned Euripides and Aeschylus</l>
     <l n="646">Will reach by this time for a pot-house mop</l>
     <l n="647">To slush their first and last of royalties .</l>
     <l n="648">Poor devils ! and they all play to his hand ;</l>

     <l n="654">We 'll all be riding , one of these fine days ,</l>
     <l n="655">Down there to see him — and his wife wo n't like us ;</l>
     <l n="656">And then we 'll think of what he never said</l>
     <l n="657">Of women — which , if taken all in all</l>
     <l n="658">With what he did say , would buy many horses .</l>
     <l n="659">Though nowadays he 's not so much for women :</l>
     <l n="660">“ So few of them , ” he says , “ are worth the guessing . ”</l>
     <l n="661">But there 's a work at work when he says that ,</l>
     <l n="662">And while he says it one feels in the air</l>
     <l n="663">A deal of circumambient hocus-pocus .</l>
     <l n="664">They 've had him dancing till his toes were tender ,</l>
     <l n="665">And he can feel ‘ em now , come chilly rains .</l>
     <l n="666">There 's no long cry for going into it ,</l>
     <l n="667">However , and we do n't know much about it .</l>
     <l n="668">The Fitton thing was worst of all , I fancy ;</l>
     <l n="669">And you in Stratford , like most here in London ,</l>
     <l n="670">Have more now in the ‘ Sonnets ’ than you paid for ;</l>
     <l n="671">He 's put her there with all her poison on ,</l>
     <l n="672">To make a singing fiction of a shadow</l>
     <l n="673">That 's in his life a fact , and always will be .</l>
     <l n="674">But she 's no care of ours , though Time , I fear ,</l>
     <l n="675">Will have a more reverberant ado</l>
     <l n="676">About her than about another one</l>
     <l n="677">Who seems to have decoyed him , married him ,</l>
     <l n="678">And sent him scuttling on his way to London ,—</l>
     <l n="679">With much already learned , and more to learn ,</l>
     <l n="680">And more to follow . Lord ! how I see him now ,</l>
     <l n="681">Pretending , maybe trying , to be like us .</l>
     <l n="682">Whatever he may have meant , we never had him ;</l>
     <l n="683">He failed us , or escaped , or what you will ,—</l>
     <l n="684">And there was that about him ( God knows what ,—</l>
     <l n="685">We 'd flayed another had he tried it on us )</l>
     <l n="686">That made as many of us as had wits</l>
     <l n="687">More fond of all his easy distances</l>
     <l n="688">Than one another 's noise and clap-your-shoulder .</l>
     <l n="689">But think you not , my friend , he 'd never talk !</l>
     <l n="690">Talk ? He was eldritch at it ; and we listened —</l>
     <l n="691">Thereby acquiring much we knew before</l>
     <l n="692">About ourselves , and hitherto had held</l>
     <l n="693">Irrelevant , or not prime to the purpose .</l>
     <l n="694">And there were some , of course , and there be now ,</l>
     <l n="695">Disordered and reduced amazedly</l>
     <l n="696">To resignation by the mystic seal</l>
     <l n="697">Of young finality the gods had laid</l>
     <l n="698">On everything that made him a young demon ;</l>
     <l n="699">And one or two shot looks at him already</l>
     <l n="700">As he had been their executioner ;</l>
     <l n="701">And once or twice he was , not knowing it ,—</l>
     <l n="702">Or knowing , being sorry for poor clay</l>
     <l n="703">And saying nothing .... Yet , for all his engines ,</l>
     <l n="704">You 'll meet a thousand of an afternoon</l>

     <l n="707">Than his , I swear , that he sees here to-day ;</l>
     <l n="708">Though he may scarcely give a Fool an exit</l>
     <l n="709">But we mark how he sees in everything</l>
     <l n="710">A law that , given we flout it once too often ,</l>
     <l n="711">Brings fire and iron down on our naked heads .</l>
     <l n="712">To me it looks as if the power that made him ,</l>
     <l n="713">For fear of giving all things to one creature ,</l>
     <l n="714">Left out the first ,— faith , innocence , illusion ,</l>
     <l n="715">Whatever ‘ tis that keeps us out o ’ Bedlam ,—</l>
     <l n="716">And thereby , for his too consuming vision ,</l>

     <l n="721">And all for cellaring what he knows wo n't keep ,</l>
     <l n="722">And what he 'd best forget — but that he can n't .</l>
     <l n="723">You 'll have it , and have more than I 'm foretelling ;</l>
     <l n="724">And there 'll be such a roaring at the Globe</l>
     <l n="725">As never stunned the bleeding gladiators .</l>
     <l n="726">He 'll have to change the color of its hair</l>
     <l n="727">A bit , for now he calls it Cleopatra .</l>
