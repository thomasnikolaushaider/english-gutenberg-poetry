       <l n="7">And ever again , in the wink of an eye ,</l>
       <l n="8">Painted stations whistle by .</l>
       <l n="9">Here is a child who clambers and scrambles ,</l>
       <l n="10">All by himself and gathering brambles ;</l>
       <l n="11">Here is a tramp who stands and gazes ;</l>
       <l n="12">And there is the green for stringing the daisies !</l>
       <l n="13">Here is a cart run away in the road</l>
       <l n="14">Lumping along with man and load ;</l>
       <l n="15">And here is a mill , and there is a river :</l>

     <p>DEDICATION</p>
     <p>There are men and classes of men that stand above the common herd : the soldier , the sailor , and the shepherd not unfrequently ; the artist rarely ; rarelier still , the clergyman ; the physician almost as a rule . He is the flower ( such as it is ) of our civilisation ; and when that stage of man is done with , and only remembered to be marvelled at in history , he will be thought to have shared as little as any in the defects of the period , and most notably exhibited the virtues of the race . Generosity he has , such as is possible to those who practise an art , never to those who drive a trade ; discretion , tested by a hundred secrets ; tact , tried in a thousand embarrassments ; and , what are more important , Heraclean cheerfulness and courage . So it is that he brings air and cheer into the sickroom , and often enough , though not so often as he wishes , brings healing .</p>
     <p>Gratitude is but a lame sentiment ; thanks , when they are expressed , are often more embarrassing than welcome ; and yet I must set forth mine to a few out of many doctors who have brought me comfort and help : to Dr. Willey of San Francisco , whose kindness to a stranger it must be as grateful to him , as it is touching to me , to remember ; to Dr. Karl Ruedi of Davos , the good genius of the English in his frosty mountains ; to Dr. Herbert of Paris , whom I knew only for a week , and to Dr. Caissot of Montpellier , whom I knew only for ten days , and who have yet written their names deeply in my memory ; to Dr. Brandt of Royat ; to Dr. Wakefield of Nice ; to Dr. Chepmell , whose visits make it a pleasure to be ill ; to Dr. Horace Dobell , so wise in counsel ; to Sir Andrew Clark , so unwearied in kindness ; and to that wise youth , my uncle , Dr. Balfour .</p>
     <p>I forget as many as I remember ; and I ask both to pardon me , these for silence , those for inadequate speech . But one name I have kept on purpose to the last , because it is a household word with me , and because if I had not received favours from so many hands and in so many quarters of the world , it should have stood upon this page alone : that of my friend Thomas Bodley Scott of Bournemouth . Will he accept this , although shared among so many , for a dedication to himself ? and when next my ill-fortune ( which has thus its pleasant side ) brings him hurrying to me when he would fain sit down to meat or lie down to rest , will he care to remember that he takes this trouble for one who is not fool enough to be ungrateful ?</p>

       <l n="1">In ancient tales , O friend , thy spirit dwelt ;</l>
       <l n="2">There , from of old , thy childhood passed ; and there</l>
       <l n="3">High expectation , high delights and deeds ,</l>
       <l n="4">Thy fluttering heart with hope and terror moved .</l>
       <l n="5">And thou hast heard of yore the Blatant Beast ,</l>
       <l n="6">And Roland 's horn , and that war-scattering shout</l>
       <l n="7">Of all-unarmed Achilles , ægis-crowned .</l>
       <l n="8">And perilous lands thou sawest , sounding shores</l>
       <l n="9">And seas and forests drear , island and dale</l>
       <l n="10">And mountain dark . For thou with Tristram rod'st</l>
       <l n="11">Or Bedevere , in farthest Lyonesse .</l>
       <l n="12">Thou hadst a booth in Samarcand , whereat</l>
       <l n="13">Side-looking Magians trafficked ; thence , by night ,</l>
       <l n="14">An Afreet snatched thee , and with wings upbore</l>
       <l n="15">Beyond the Aral Mount ; or , hoping gain ,</l>
       <l n="16">Thou , with a jar of money , didst embark</l>
       <l n="17">For Balsorah by sea . But chiefly thou</l>
       <l n="18">In that clear air took'st life ; in Arcady</l>
       <l n="19">The haunted , land of song ; and by the wells</l>
       <l n="20">Where most the gods frequent . There Chiron old ,</l>
       <l n="21">In the Pelethronian antre , taught thee lore ;</l>
       <l n="22">The plants he taught , and by the shining stars</l>
       <l n="23">In forests dim to steer . There hast thou seen</l>
       <l n="24">Immortal Pan dance secret in a glade ,</l>
       <l n="25">And , dancing , roll his eyes ; these , where they fell ,</l>
       <l n="26">Shed glee , and through the congregated oaks</l>
       <l n="27">A flying horror winged ; while all the earth</l>
       <l n="28">To the god 's pregnant footing thrilled within .</l>
       <l n="29">Or whiles , beside the sobbing stream , he breathed ,</l>
       <l n="30">In his clutched pipe unformed and wizard strains</l>
       <l n="31">Divine yet brutal ; which the forest heard ,</l>
       <l n="32">And thou , with awe ; and far upon the plain</l>

       <l n="34">Now things there are that , upon him who sees ,</l>

       <l n="37">For evermore thou hear'st immortal Pan</l>

       <l n="57">Long cold with rains , and where old terror lodged ,</l>
       <l n="58">And where the dead : so thee undying Hope ,</l>
       <l n="59">With all her pack , hunts screaming through the years :</l>
       <l n="60">Here , there , thou fleeëst ; but nor here nor there</l>
       <l n="61">The pleasant gods abide , the glory dwells .</l>

       <l n="63">This was not Venus , though she Venus seemed</l>
       <l n="64">A moment . And though fair yon river move ,</l>
       <l n="65">She , all the way , from disenchanted fount</l>
       <l n="66">To seas unhallowed runs ; the gods forsook</l>
       <l n="67">Long since her trembling rushes ; from her plains</l>
       <l n="68">Disconsolate , long since adventure fled ;</l>
       <l n="69">And now although the inviting river flows ,</l>
       <l n="70">And every poplared cape , and every bend</l>
       <l n="71">Or willowy islet , win upon thy soul</l>
       <l n="72">And to thy hopeful shallop whisper speed ;</l>
       <l n="73">Yet hope not thou at all ; hope is no more ;</l>
       <l n="74">And O , long since the golden groves are dead</l>

       <l n="1">The year runs through her phases ; rain and sun ,</l>

       <l n="3">But one pale season rules the house of death .</l>
       <l n="4">Cold falls the imprisoned daylight ; fell disease</l>
       <l n="5">By each lean pallet squats , and pain and sleep</l>
       <l n="6">Toss gaping on the pillows .</l>
       <l n="7">But O thou !</l>
       <l n="8">Uprise and take thy pipe . Bid music flow ,</l>
       <l n="9">Strains by good thoughts attended , like the spring</l>
       <l n="10">The swallows follow over land and sea .</l>
       <l n="11">Pain sleeps at once ; at once , with open eyes ,</l>
       <l n="12">Dozing despair awakes . The shepherd sees</l>
       <l n="13">His flock come bleating home ; the seaman hears</l>
       <l n="14">Once more the cordage rattle . Airs of home !</l>
       <l n="15">Youth , love , and roses blossom ; the gaunt ward</l>
       <l n="16">Dislimns and disappears , and , opening out ,</l>
       <l n="17">Shows brooks and forests , and the blue beyond</l>
       <l n="18">Of mountains .</l>
       <l n="19">Small the pipe ; but O ! do thou ,</l>
       <l n="20">Peak-faced and suffering piper , blow therein</l>
       <l n="21">The dirge of heroes dead ; and to these sick ,</l>
       <l n="22">These dying , sound the triumph over death .</l>
       <l n="23">Behold ! each greatly breathes ; each tastes a joy</l>
       <l n="24">Unknown before , in dying ; for each knows</l>
       <l n="25">A hero dies with him — though unfulfilled ,</l>
       <l n="26">Yet conquering truly — and not dies in vain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="27">So is pain cheered , death comforted ; the house</l>

       <l n="1">Out of the sun , out of the blast ,</l>
       <l n="2">Out of the world , alone I passed</l>

       <l n="6">Nor rumour of the world of life ,</l>
       <l n="7">Nor confidences low and dear ,</l>
       <l n="8">Shall strike the meditative ear .</l>
       <l n="9">Aloof , unhelpful , and unkind ,</l>
       <l n="10">The prisoners of the iron mind ,</l>
       <l n="11">Where nothing speaks except the bell ,</l>

     <p>BOOK II</p>
     <p>IN SCOTS</p>
     <p>NOTE TO BOOK II</p>
     <p>The human conscience has fled of late the troublesome domain of conduct for what I should have supposed to be the less congenial field of art : there she may now be said to rage , and with special severity in all that touches dialect : so that in every novel the letters of the alphabet are tortured , and the reader wearied , to commemorate shades of mispronunciation . Now , spelling is an art of great difficulty in my eyes , and I am inclined to lean upon the printer , even in common practice , rather than to venture abroad upon new quests . And the Scots tongue has an orthography of its own , lacking neither “ authority nor author . ” Yet the temptation is great to lend a little guidance to the bewildered Englishman . Some simple phonetic artifice might defend your verses from barbarous mishandling , and yet not injure any vested interest . So it seems at first ; but there are rocks ahead . Thus , if I wish the diphthong ou to have its proper value , I may write oor instead of our ; many have done so and lived , and the pillars of the universe remained unshaken . But if I did so , and came presently to doun , which is the classical Scots spelling of the English down , I should begin to feel uneasy ; and if I went on a little further , and came to a classical Scots word , like stour or dour or clour , I should know precisely where I was — that is to say , that I was out of sight of land on those high seas of spelling reform in which so many strong swimmers have toiled vainly . To some the situation is exhilarating ; as for me , I give one bubbling cry and sink . The compromise at which I have arrived is indefensible , and I have no thought of trying to defend it . As I have stuck for the most part to the proper spelling , I append a table of some common vowel sounds which no one need consult ; and just to prove that I belong to my age and have in me the stuff of a reformer , I have used modification marks throughout . Thus I can tell myself , not without pride , that I have added a fresh stumbling-block for English readers , and to a page of print in my native tongue have lent a new uncouthness . Sed non nobis .</p>
     <p>I note again , that among our new dialecticians , the local habitat of every dialect is given to the square mile . I could not emulate this nicety if I desired ; for I simply wrote my Scots as well as I was able , not caring if it hailed from Lauderdale or Angus , from the Mearns or Galloway ; if I had ever heard a good word , I used it without shame ; and when Scots was lacking , or the rhyme jibbed , I was glad ( like my betters ) to fall back on English . For all that , I own to a friendly feeling for the tongue of Fergusson and of Sir Walter , both Edinburgh men ; and I confess that Burns has always sounded in my ear like something partly foreign . And indeed I am from the Lothians myself ; it is there I heard the language spoken about my childhood ; and it is in the drawling Lothian voice that I repeat it to myself . Let the precisians call my speech that of the Lothians . And if it be not pure , alas ! what matters it ? The day draws near when this illustrious and malleable tongue shall be quite forgotten ; and Burns 's Ayrshire , and Dr. MacDonald 's Aberdeen-awa ’ , and Scott 's brave , metropolitan utterance will be all equally the ghosts of speech . Till then I would love to have my hour as a native Maker , and be read by my own countryfolk in our own dying language ; an ambition surely rather of the heart than of the head , so restricted as it is in prospect of endurance , so parochial in bounds of space .</p>

     <p>NOTE .— It may be guessed by some that I had a certain parish in my eye , and this makes it proper I should add a word of disclamation . In my time there have been two ministers in that parish . Of the first I have a special reason to speak well , even had there been any to think ill . The second I have often met in private and long ( in the due phrase ) “ sat under ” in his church , and neither here nor there have I heard an unkind or ugly word upon his lips . The preacher of the text had thus no original in that particular parish ; but when I was a boy , he might have been observed in many others ; he was then ( like the schoolmaster ) abroad ; and by recent advices , it would seem he has not yet entirely disappeared .— [ R. L. S .]</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It fell in the days of old , as the men of Taiárapu tell ,</l>
       <l n="2">A youth went forth to the fishing , and fortune favoured him well .</l>
       <l n="3">Támatéa his name : gullible , simple , and kind .</l>
       <l n="4">Comely of countenance , nimble of body , empty of mind ,</l>
       <l n="5">His mother ruled him and loved him beyond the wont of a wife ,</l>
       <l n="6">Serving the lad for eyes and living herself in his life .</l>
       <l n="7">Alone from the sea and the fishing came Támatéa the fair ,</l>
       <l n="8">Urging his boat to the beach , and the mother awaited him there .</l>
       <l n="9">— “ Long may you live ! ” said she . “ Your fishing has sped to a wish .</l>
       <l n="10">And now let us choose for the king the fairest of all your fish .</l>
       <l n="11">For fear inhabits the palace and grudging grows in the land ,</l>
       <l n="12">Marked is the sluggardly foot and marked the niggardly hand ,</l>
       <l n="13">The hours and the miles are counted , the tributes numbered and weighed ,</l>
       <l n="14">And woe to him that comes short , and woe to him that delayed ! ”</l>
       <l n="15">So spoke on the beach the mother , and counselled the wiser thing .</l>
       <l n="16">For Rahéro stirred in the country and secretly mined the king .</l>
       <l n="17">Nor were the signals wanting of how the leaven wrought ,</l>
       <l n="18">In the cords of obedience loosed and the tributes grudgingly brought .</l>
       <l n="19">And when last to the temple of Oro the boat with the victim sped ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the priest uncovered the basket and looked on the face of the dead ,</l>
       <l n="21">Trembling fell upon all at sight of an ominous thing ,</l>
       <l n="22">For there was the aito<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>dead , and he of the house of the king .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="23">So spake on the beach the mother , matter worthy of note ,</l>
       <l n="24">And wattled a basket well , and chose a fish from the boat ;</l>
       <l n="25">And Támatéa the pliable shouldered the basket and went ,</l>
       <l n="26">And travelled , and sang as he travelled , a lad that was well content .</l>
       <l n="27">Still the way of his going was round by the roaring coast ,</l>
       <l n="28">Where the ring of the reef is broke and the trades run riot the most .</l>
       <l n="29">On his left , with smoke as of battle , the billows battered the land ;</l>
       <l n="30">Unscalable , turreted mountains rose on the inner hand .</l>
       <l n="31">And cape , and village , and river , and vale , and mountain above ,</l>
       <l n="32">Each had a name in the land for men to remember and love ;</l>
       <l n="33">And never the name of a place , but lo ! a song in its praise :</l>
       <l n="34">Ancient and unforgotten , songs of the earlier days</l>
       <l n="35">That the elders taught to the young , and at night , in the full of the</l>
       <l n="36">moon ,</l>
       <l n="37">Garlanded boys and maidens sang together in tune .</l>
       <l n="38">Támatéa the placable went with a lingering foot ;</l>
       <l n="39">He sang as loud as a bird , he whistled hoarse as a flute ;</l>
       <l n="40">He broiled in the sun , he breathed in the grateful shadow of trees ,</l>
       <l n="41">In the icy stream of the rivers he waded over the knees ;</l>
       <l n="42">And still in his empty mind crowded , a thousand-fold ,</l>
       <l n="43">The deeds of the strong and the songs of the cunning heroes of old .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="44">And now was he come to a place Taiárapu honoured the most ,</l>
       <l n="45">Where a silent valley of woods debouched on the noisy coast ,</l>
       <l n="46">Spewing a level river . There was a haunt of Pai .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="47">There , in his potent youth , when his parents drove him to die ,</l>
       <l n="48">Honoura lived like a beast , lacking the lamp and the fire ,</l>
       <l n="49">Washed by the rains of the trade and clotting his hair in the mire ;</l>
       <l n="50">And there , so mighty his hands , he bent the tree to his foot —</l>
       <l n="51">So keen the spur of his hunger , he plucked it naked of fruit .</l>
       <l n="52">There , as she pondered the clouds for the shadow of coming ills ,</l>
       <l n="53">Ahupu , the woman of song , walked on high on the hills .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="54">Of these was Rahéro sprung , a man of a godly race ;</l>
       <l n="55">And inherited cunning of spirit , and beauty of body and face .</l>
       <l n="56">Of yore in his youth , as an aito , Rahéro wandered the land ,</l>
       <l n="57">Delighting maids with his tongue , smiting men with his hand .</l>
       <l n="58">Famous he was in his youth ; but before the midst of his life</l>
       <l n="59">Paused , and fashioned a song of farewell to glory and strife .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="60">House of mine ( it went ) , house upon the sea ,</l>
       <l n="61">Belov 'd of all my fathers , more belov 'd by me !</l>
       <l n="62">Vale of the strong Honoura , deep ravine of Pai ,</l>
       <l n="63">Again in your woody summits I hear the trade-wind cry .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">

       <l n="67">Sweeter now in my house I hear the trade-wind cry .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="68">These were the words of his singing , other the thought of his heart ;</l>
       <l n="69">For secret desire of glory vexed him , dwelling apart .</l>
       <l n="70">Lazy and crafty he was , and loved to lie in the sun ,</l>
       <l n="71">And loved the cackle of talk and the true word uttered in fun ;</l>
       <l n="72">Lazy he was , his roof was ragged , his table was lean ,</l>
       <l n="73">And the fish swam safe in his sea , and he gathered the near and the</l>
       <l n="74">green .</l>
       <l n="75">He sat in his house and laughed , but he loathed the king of the land ,</l>
       <l n="76">And he uttered the grudging word under the covering hand .</l>
       <l n="77">Treason spread from his door ; and he looked for a day to come ,</l>
       <l n="78">A day of the crowding people , a day of the summoning drum ,</l>
       <l n="79">When the vote should be taken , the king be driven forth in disgrace ,</l>
       <l n="80">And Rahéro , the laughing and lazy , sit and rule in his place .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="81">Here Támatéa came , and beheld the house on the brook ;</l>
       <l n="82">And Rahéro was there by the way and covered an oven to cook .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="83">Naked he was to the loins , but the tattoo covered the lack ,</l>
       <l n="84">And the sun and the shadow of palms dappled his muscular back .</l>
       <l n="85">Swiftly he lifted his head at the fall of the coming feet ,</l>
       <l n="86">And the water sprang in his mouth with a sudden desire of meat :</l>
       <l n="87">For he marked the basket carried , covered from flies and the sun ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="88">And Rahéro buried his fire , but the meat in his house was done .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="89">Forth he stepped ; and took , and delayed the boy , by the hand ;</l>
       <l n="90">And vaunted the joys of meat and the ancient ways of the land :</l>
       <l n="91">— “ Our sires of old in Taiárapu , they that created the race ,</l>
       <l n="92">Ate ever with eager hand , nor regarded season or place ,</l>
       <l n="93">Ate in the boat at the oar , on the way afoot ; and at night</l>
       <l n="94">Arose in the midst of dreams to rummage the house for a bite .</l>
       <l n="95">It is good for the youth in his turn to follow the way of the sire ;</l>
       <l n="96">And behold how fitting the time ! for here do I cover my fire . ”</l>
       <l n="97">— “ I see the fire for the cooking , but never the meat to cook , ”</l>
       <l n="98">Said Támatéa .— “ Tut ! ” said Rahéro . “ Here in the brook ,</l>
       <l n="99">And there in the tumbling sea , the fishes are thick as flies ,</l>
       <l n="100">Hungry like healthy men , and like pigs for savour and size :</l>
       <l n="101">Crayfish crowding the river , sea-fish thronging the sea . ”</l>
       <l n="102">— “ Well , it may be , ” says the other , “ and yet be nothing to me .</l>
       <l n="103">Fain would I eat , but alas ! I have needful matter in hand ,</l>
       <l n="104">Since I carry my tribute of fish to the jealous king of the land . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="105">Now at the word a light sprang in Rahéro 's eyes .</l>
       <l n="106">“ I will gain me a dinner , ” thought he , “ and lend the king a surprise . ”</l>
       <l n="107">And he took the lad by the arm , as they stood by the side of the track ,</l>
       <l n="108">And smiled , and rallied , and flattered , and pushed him forward and back .</l>
       <l n="109">It was “ You that sing like a bird , I never have heard you sing , ”</l>
       <l n="110">And “ The lads when I was a lad were none so feared of a king .</l>
       <l n="111">And of what account is an hour , when the heart is empty of guile ?</l>
       <l n="112">But come , and sit in the house and laugh with the women awhile ;</l>
       <l n="113">And I will but drop my hook , and behold ! the dinner made . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="114">So Támatéa the pliable hung up his fish in the shade</l>
       <l n="115">On a tree by the side of the way ; and Rahéro carried him in ,</l>
       <l n="116">Smiling as smiles the fowler when flutters the bird to the gin ,</l>
       <l n="117">And chose him a shining hook ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>and viewed it with sedulous eye ,</l>
       <l n="118">And breathed and burnished it well on the brawn of his naked thigh ,</l>
       <l n="119">And set a mat for the gull , and bade him be merry and bide ,</l>
       <l n="120">Like a man concerned for his guest , and the fishing , and nothing beside .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="121">Now when Rahéro was forth , he paused and hearkened , and heard</l>
       <l n="122">The gull jest in the house and the women laugh at his word ;</l>
       <l n="123">And stealthily crossed to the side of the way , to the shady place</l>
       <l n="124">Where the basket hung on a mango ; and craft transfigured his face .</l>
       <l n="125">Deftly he opened the basket , and took of the fat of the fish ,</l>
       <l n="126">The cut of kings and chieftains , enough for a goodly dish .</l>
       <l n="127">This he wrapped in a leaf , set on the fire to cook ,</l>
       <l n="128">And buried ; and next the marred remains of the tribute he took ,</l>
       <l n="129">And doubled and packed them well , and covered the basket close .</l>
       <l n="130">— “ There is a buffet , my king , ” quoth he , “ and a nauseous dose ! ” —</l>
       <l n="131">And hung the basket again in the shade , in a cloud of flies ;</l>
       <l n="132">— “ And there is a sauce to your dinner , king of the crafty eyes ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="133">Soon as the oven was open , the fish smelt excellent good .</l>
       <l n="134">In the shade , by the house of Rahéro , down they sat to their food ,</l>
       <l n="135">And cleared the leaves ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>in silence , or uttered a jest and laughed</l>
       <l n="136">And raising the cocoa-nut bowls , buried their faces and quaffed .</l>
       <l n="137">But chiefly in silence they ate ; and soon as the meal was done ,</l>
       <l n="138">Rahéro feigned to remember and measured the hour by the sun</l>
       <l n="139">And “ Támatéa , ” quoth he , “ it is time to be jogging , my lad . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="140">So Támatéa arose , doing ever the thing he was bade ,</l>
       <l n="141">And carelessly shouldered the basket , and kindly saluted his host ;</l>
       <l n="142">And again the way of his going was round by the roaring coast .</l>
       <l n="143">Long he went ; and at length was aware of a pleasant green ,</l>
       <l n="144">And the stems and shadows of palms , and roofs of lodges between .</l>
       <l n="145">There sate , in the door of his palace , the king on a kingly seat ,</l>
       <l n="146">And aitos stood armed around , and the yottowas<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>sat at his feet .</l>
       <l n="147">But fear was a worm in his heart : fear darted his eyes ;</l>
       <l n="148">And he probed men 's faces for treasons and pondered their speech for</l>
       <l n="149">lies .</l>
       <l n="150">To him came Támatéa , the basket slung in his hand ,</l>
       <l n="151">And paid him the due obeisance standing as vassals stand .</l>
       <l n="152">In silence hearkened the king , and closed the eyes in his face ,</l>
       <l n="153">Harbouring odious thoughts and the baseless fears of the base ;</l>
       <l n="154">In silence accepted the gift and sent the giver away .</l>
       <l n="155">So Támatéa departed , turning his back on the day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="156">And lo ! as the king sat brooding , a rumour rose in the crowd ;</l>
       <l n="157">The yottowas nudged and whispered , the commons murmured aloud ;</l>
       <l n="158">Tittering fell upon all at sight of the impudent thing ,</l>
       <l n="159">At the sight of a gift unroyal flung in the face of a king .</l>
       <l n="160">And the face of the king turned white and red with anger and shame</l>
       <l n="161">In their midst ; and the heart in his body was water and then was flame ;</l>
       <l n="162">Till of a sudden , turning , he gripped an aito hard ,</l>
       <l n="163">A youth that stood with his ómare ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>one of the daily guard ,</l>
       <l n="164">And spat in his ear a command , and pointed and uttered a name ,</l>
       <l n="165">And hid in the shade of the house his impotent anger and shame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="166">Now Támatéa the fool was far on his homeward way ,</l>
       <l n="167">The rising night in his face , behind him the dying day .</l>
       <l n="168">Rahéro saw him go by , and the heart of Rahéro was glad ,</l>
       <l n="169">Devising shame to the king and nowise harm to the lad ;</l>
       <l n="170">And all that dwelt by the way saw and saluted him well ,</l>
       <l n="171">For he had the face of a friend and the news of the town to tell ;</l>
       <l n="172">And pleased with the notice of folk , and pleased that his journey was</l>
       <l n="173">done ,</l>
       <l n="174">Támatéa drew homeward , turning his back to the sun .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="175">And now was the hour of the bath in Taiárapu : far and near</l>
       <l n="176">The lovely laughter of bathers rose and delighted his ear .</l>
       <l n="177">Night massed in the valleys ; the sun on the mountain coast</l>
       <l n="178">Struck , end-long ; and above the clouds embattled their host ,</l>
       <l n="179">And glowed and gloomed on the heights ; and the heads of the palms were</l>
       <l n="180">gems ,</l>
       <l n="181">And far to the rising eve extended the shade of their stems ;</l>
       <l n="182">And the shadow of Támatéa hovered already at home .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="183">And sudden the sound of one coming and running light as the foam</l>
       <l n="184">Struck on his ear ; and he turned , and lo ! a man on his track ,</l>
       <l n="185">Girded and armed with an ómare , following hard at his back .</l>
       <l n="186">At a bound the man was upon him ;— and , or ever a word was said ,</l>
       <l n="187">The loaded end of the ómare fell and laid him dead .</l>

      <head>THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Thus was Rahéro 's treason ; thus and no further it sped .</l>
       <l n="2">The king sat safe in his place and a kindly fool was dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">But the mother of Támatéa arose with death in her eyes .</l>
       <l n="4">All night long , and the next , Taiárapu rang with her cries .</l>
       <l n="5">As when a babe in the wood turns with a chill of doubt</l>
       <l n="6">And perceives nor home , nor friends , for the trees have closed her</l>
       <l n="7">about ,</l>
       <l n="8">The mountain rings and her breast is torn with the voice of despair :</l>
       <l n="9">So the lion-like woman idly wearied the air</l>
       <l n="10">For a while , and pierced men 's hearing in vain , and wounded their</l>
       <l n="11">hearts .</l>
       <l n="12">But as when the weather changes at sea , in dangerous parts ,</l>
       <l n="13">And sudden the hurricane wrack unrolls up the front of the sky ,</l>
       <l n="14">At once the ship lies idle , the sails hang silent on high ,</l>
       <l n="15">The breath of the wind that blew is blown out like the flame of a lamp ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the silent armies of death draw near with inaudible tramp :</l>
       <l n="17">So sudden , the voice of her weeping ceased ; in silence she rose</l>
       <l n="18">And passed from the house of her sorrow , a woman clothed with repose ,</l>
       <l n="19">Carrying death in her breast and sharpening death in her hand .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="20">Hither she went and thither in all the coasts of the land .</l>
       <l n="21">They tell that she feared not to slumber alone , in the dead of night ,</l>
       <l n="22">In accursed places ; beheld , unblenched , the ribbon of light<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></l>
       <l n="23">Spin from temple to temple ; guided the perilous skiff ,</l>
       <l n="24">Abhorred not the paths of the mountain and trod the verge of the cliff ;</l>
       <l n="25">From end to end of the island , thought not the distance long ,</l>
       <l n="26">But forth from king to king carried the tale of her wrong .</l>
       <l n="27">To king after king , as they sat in the palace door , she came ,</l>
       <l n="28">Claiming kinship , declaiming verses , naming her name</l>
       <l n="29">And the names of all of her fathers ; and still , with a heart on the</l>
       <l n="30">rack ,</l>
       <l n="31">Jested to capture a hearing and laughed when they jested back ;</l>
       <l n="32">So would deceive them a while , and change and return in a breath ,</l>
       <l n="33">And on all the men of Vaiau imprecate instant death ;</l>
       <l n="34">And tempt her kings — for Vaiau was a rich and prosperous land ,</l>
       <l n="35">And flatter — for who would attempt it but warriors mighty of hand ?</l>
       <l n="36">And change in a breath again and rise in a strain of song ,</l>
       <l n="37">Invoking the beaten drums , beholding the fall of the strong ,</l>
       <l n="38">Calling the fowls of the air to come and feast on the dead .</l>
       <l n="39">And they held the chin in silence , and heard her , and shook the head ;</l>
       <l n="40">For they knew the men of Taiárapu famous in battle and feast ,</l>
       <l n="41">Marvellous eaters and smiters : the men of Vaiau not least .</l>
       <l n="42">To the land of the Námunu-úra , to Paea ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>at length she came ,</l>
       <l n="43">To men who were foes to the Tevas and hated their race and name .</l>
       <l n="44">There was she well received , and spoke with Hiopa the king .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span></l>
       <l n="45">And Hiopa listened , and weighed , and wisely considered the thing .</l>
       <l n="46">“ Here in the back of the isle we dwell in a sheltered place , ”</l>
       <l n="47">Quoth he to the woman , “ in quiet , a weak and peaceable race .</l>
       <l n="48">But far in the teeth of the wind lofty Taiárapu lies ;</l>
       <l n="49">Strong blows the wind of the trade on its seaward face , and cries</l>
       <l n="50">Aloud in the top of arduous mountains , and utters its song</l>
       <l n="51">In green continuous forests . Strong is the wind , and strong</l>
       <l n="52">And fruitful and hardy the race , famous in battle and feast ,</l>
       <l n="53">Marvellous eaters and smiters : the men of Vaiau not least .</l>
       <l n="54">Now hearken to me , my daughter , and hear a word of the wise :</l>
       <l n="55">How a strength goes linked with a weakness , two by two , like the eyes .</l>
       <l n="56">They can wield the ómare well and cast the javelin far ;</l>
       <l n="57">Yet are they greedy and weak as the swine and the children are .</l>
       <l n="58">Plant we , then , here at Paea a garden of excellent fruits ;</l>
       <l n="59">Plant we bananas and kava and taro , the king of roots ;</l>
       <l n="60">Let the pigs in Paea be tapu<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>and no man fish for a year ;</l>
       <l n="61">And of all the meat in Tahiti gather we threefold here .</l>
       <l n="62">So shall the fame of our plenty fill the island and so ,</l>
       <l n="63">At last , on the tongue of rumour , go where we wish it to go .</l>
       <l n="64">Then shall the pigs of Taiárapu raise their snouts in the air ;</l>
       <l n="65">But we sit quiet and wait , as the fowler sits by the snare ,</l>
       <l n="66">And tranquilly fold our hands , till the pigs come nosing the food :</l>
       <l n="67">But meanwhile build us a house of Trotéa , the stubborn wood ,</l>
       <l n="68">Bind it with incombustible thongs , set a roof to the room ,</l>
       <l n="69">Too strong for the hands of a man to dissever or fire to consume ;</l>
       <l n="70">And there , when the pigs come trotting , there shall the feast be spread ,</l>
       <l n="71">There shall the eye of the morn enlighten the feasters dead .</l>
       <l n="72">So be it done ; for I have a heart that pities your state ,</l>
       <l n="73">And Nateva and Námunu-úra are fire and water for hate . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="74">All was done as he said , and the gardens prospered ; and now</l>
       <l n="75">The fame of their plenty went out , and word of it came to Vaiau .</l>
       <l n="76">For the men of Námunu-úra sailed , to the windward far ,</l>
       <l n="77">Lay in the offing by south where the towns of the Tevas are ,</l>
       <l n="78">And cast overboard of their plenty ; and lo ! at the Tevas ’ feet</l>
       <l n="79">The surf on all the beaches tumbled treasures of meat .</l>
       <l n="80">In the salt of the sea , a harvest tossed with the refluent foam ;</l>
       <l n="81">And the children gleaned it in playing , and ate and carried it home ;</l>
       <l n="82">And the elders stared and debated , and wondered and passed the jest ,</l>
       <l n="83">But whenever a guest came by eagerly questioned the guest ;</l>
       <l n="84">And little by little , from one to another , the word went round :</l>
       <l n="85">“ In all the borders of Paea the victual rots on the ground ,</l>
       <l n="86">And swine are plenty as rats . And now , when they fare to the sea ,</l>
       <l n="87">The men of the Námunu-úra glean from under the tree</l>
       <l n="88">And load the canoe to the gunwale with all that is toothsome to eat ;</l>
       <l n="89">And all day long on the sea the jaws are crushing the meat ,</l>
       <l n="90">The steersman eats at the helm , the rowers munch at the oar ,</l>
       <l n="91">And at length , when their bellies are full , overboard with the store ! ”</l>
       <l n="92">Now was the word made true , and soon as the bait was bare ,</l>
       <l n="93">All the pigs of Taiárapu raised their snouts in the air .</l>
       <l n="94">Songs were recited , and kinship was counted , and tales were told</l>
       <l n="95">How war had severed of late but peace had cemented of old</l>
       <l n="96">The clans of the island . “ To war , ” said they , “ now set we an end ,</l>
       <l n="97">And hie to the Námunu-úra even as a friend to a friend . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="98">So judged , and a day was named ; and soon as the morning broke ,</l>
       <l n="99">Canoes were thrust in the sea , and the houses emptied of folk .</l>
       <l n="100">Strong blew the wind of the south , the wind that gathers the clan ;</l>
       <l n="101">Along all the line of the reef the clamorous surges ran ;</l>
       <l n="102">And the clouds were piled on the top of the island mountain-high ,</l>
       <l n="103">A mountain throned on a mountain . The fleet of canoes swept by</l>
       <l n="104">In the midst , on the green lagoon , with a crew released from care ,</l>
       <l n="105">Sailing an even water , breathing a summer air ,</l>
       <l n="106">Cheered by a cloudless sun ; and ever to left and right ,</l>
       <l n="107">Bursting surge on the reef , drenching storms on the height .</l>
       <l n="108">So the folk of Vaiau sailed and were glad all day ,</l>
       <l n="109">Coasting the palm-tree cape and crossing the populous bay</l>
       <l n="110">By all the towns of the Tevas ; and still as they bowled along ,</l>
       <l n="111">Boat would answer to boat with jest and laughter and song ,</l>
       <l n="112">And the people of all the towns trooped to the sides of the sea ,</l>
       <l n="113">And gazed from under the hand or sprang aloft on the tree</l>
       <l n="114">Hailing and cheering . Time failed them for more to do ;</l>
       <l n="115">The holiday village careened to the wind , and was gone from view</l>
       <l n="116">Swift as a passing bird ; and ever as onward it bore ,</l>
       <l n="117">Like the cry of the passing bird , bequeathed its song to the shore —</l>
       <l n="118">Desirable laughter of maids and the cry of delight of the child .</l>
       <l n="119">And the gazer , left behind , stared at the wake and smiled .</l>
       <l n="120">By all the towns of the Tevas they went , and Pápara last ,</l>
       <l n="121">The home of the chief , the place of muster in war ; and passed</l>
       <l n="122">The march of the lands of the clan , to the lands of an alien folk .</l>
       <l n="123">And there , from the dusk of the shoreside palms , a column of smoke</l>
       <l n="124">Mounted and wavered and died in the gold of the setting sun ,</l>
       <l n="125">“ Paea ! ” they cried . “ It is Paea . ” And so was the voyage done .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="126">In the early fall of the night Hiopa came to the shore ,</l>
       <l n="127">And beheld and counted the comers , and lo , they were forty score ;</l>
       <l n="128">The pelting feet of the babes that ran already and played ,</l>
       <l n="129">The clean-lipped smile of the boy , the slender breasts of the maid ,</l>
       <l n="130">And mighty limbs of women , stalwart mothers of men .</l>
       <l n="131">The sires stood forth unabashed ; but a little back from</l>
       <l n="132">his ken</l>
       <l n="133">Clustered the scarcely nubile , the lads and maids , in a ring ,</l>
       <l n="134">Fain of each other , afraid of themselves , aware of the king</l>
       <l n="135">And aping behaviour , but clinging together with hands and eyes ,</l>
       <l n="136">With looks that were kind like kisses , and laughter tender as sighs .</l>
       <l n="137">There , too , the grandsire stood , raising his silver crest ,</l>
       <l n="138">And the impotent hands of a suckling groped in his barren breast .</l>
       <l n="139">The childhood of love , the pair well married , the innocent brood ,</l>
       <l n="140">The tale of the generations repeated and ever renewed —</l>
       <l n="141">Hiopa beheld them together , all the ages of man ,</l>
       <l n="142">And a moment shook in his purpose .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="143">But these were the foes of his clan ,</l>
       <l n="144">And he trod upon pity , and came , and civilly greeted the king ,</l>
       <l n="145">And gravely entreated Rahéro ; and for all that could fight or sing ,</l>
       <l n="146">And claimed a name in the land , had fitting phrases of praise :</l>
       <l n="147">But with all who were well-descended he spoke of the ancient days .</l>
       <l n="148">And “ ‘ Tis true , ” said he , “ that in Paea the victual rots on the ground ;</l>
       <l n="149">But , friends , your number is many ; and pigs must be hunted and found ,</l>
       <l n="150">And the lads must troop to the mountains to bring the féis down ,</l>
       <l n="151">And around the bowls of the kava cluster the maids of the town .</l>
       <l n="152">So , for to-night , sleep here ; but king , common , and priest</l>
       <l n="153">To-morrow , in order due , shall sit with me in the feast . ”</l>
       <l n="154">Sleepless the live-long night , Hiopa 's followers toiled .</l>
       <l n="155">The pigs screamed and were slaughtered ; the spars of the guest-house</l>
       <l n="156">oiled ,</l>
       <l n="157">The leaves spread on the floor . In many a mountain glen</l>
       <l n="158">The moon drew shadows of trees on the naked bodies of men</l>
       <l n="159">Plucking and bearing fruits ; and in all the bounds of the town</l>
       <l n="160">Red glowed the cocoa-nut fires , and were buried and trodden down .</l>
       <l n="161">Thus did seven of the yottowas toil with their tale of the clan ,</l>
       <l n="162">But the eighth wrought with his lads , hid from the sight of man .</l>
       <l n="163">In the deeps of the woods they laboured , piling the fuel high</l>
       <l n="164">In fagots , the load of a man , fuel seasoned and dry ,</l>
       <l n="165">Thirsty to seize upon fire and apt to blurt into flame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="166">And now was the day of the feast . The forests , as morning came ,</l>
       <l n="167">Tossed in the wind , and the peaks quaked in the blaze of the day —</l>
       <l n="168">And the cocoa-nuts showered on the ground , rebounding and rolling away :</l>
       <l n="169">A glorious morn for a feast , a famous wind for a fire .</l>
       <l n="170">To the hall of feasting Hiopa led them , mother and sire</l>
       <l n="171">And maid and babe in a tale , the whole of the holiday throng .</l>
       <l n="172">Smiling they came , garlanded green , not dreaming of wrong ;</l>
       <l n="173">And for every three , a pig , tenderly cooked in the ground ,</l>
       <l n="174">Waited ; and féi , the staff of life , heaped in a mound</l>
       <l n="175">For each where he sat ;— for each , bananas roasted and raw</l>
       <l n="176">Piled with a bountiful hand , as for horses hay and straw</l>
       <l n="177">Are stacked in a stable ; and fish , the food of desire ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span></l>
       <l n="178">And plentiful vessels of sauce , and bread-fruit gilt in the fire ;—</l>
       <l n="179">And kava was common as water . Feasts have there been ere now ,</l>
       <l n="180">And many , but never a feast like that of the folk of Vaiau .</l>
       <l n="181">All day long they ate with the resolute greed of brutes ,</l>
       <l n="182">And turned from the pigs to the fish , and again from the fish to the</l>
       <l n="183">fruits ,</l>
       <l n="184">And emptied the vessels of sauce , and drank of the kava deep ;</l>
       <l n="185">Till the young lay stupid as stones , and the strongest nodded to sleep .</l>
       <l n="186">Sleep that was mighty as death and blind as a moonless night</l>
       <l n="187">Tethered them hand and foot ; and their souls were drowned , and the light</l>
       <l n="188">Was cloaked from their eyes . Senseless together , the old and the young ,</l>
       <l n="189">The fighter deadly to smite and the prater cunning of tongue ,</l>
       <l n="190">The woman wedded and fruitful , inured to the pangs of birth ,</l>
       <l n="191">And the maid that knew not of kisses , blindly sprawled on the earth .</l>
       <l n="192">From the hall Hiopa the king and his chiefs came stealthily forth .</l>

       <l n="193">Already the sun hung low and enlightened the peaks of the north ;</l>

       <l n="195">Showering the nuts in the dusk , and e'en as a banner is torn ,</l>
       <l n="196">High on the peaks of the island , shattered the mountain cloud .</l>
       <l n="197">And now at once , at a signal , a silent , emulous crowd</l>
       <l n="198">Set hands to the work of death , hurrying to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="199">Like ants , to furnish the fagots , building them broad and low ,</l>
       <l n="200">And piling them high and higher around the walls of the hall .</l>
       <l n="201">Silence persisted within , for sleep lay heavy on all</l>
       <l n="202">But the mother of Támatéa stood at Hiopa 's side ,</l>
       <l n="203">And shook for terror and joy like a girl that is a bride ,</l>
       <l n="204">Night fell on the toilers , and first Hiopa the wise</l>
       <l n="205">Made the round of the hose , visiting all with his eyes ;</l>
       <l n="206">And all was piled to the eaves , and fuel blockaded the door ;</l>
       <l n="207">And within , in the house beleaguered , slumbered the forty score .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="208">Then was an aito despatched and came with fire in his hand ,</l>
       <l n="209">And Hiopa took it .— “ Within , ” said he , “ is the life of a land ;</l>
       <l n="210">And behold ! I breathe on the coal , I breathe on the dales of the east ,</l>
       <l n="211">And silence falls on forest and shore ; the voice of the feast</l>
       <l n="212">Is quenched , and the smoke of cooking ; the roof-tree decays and falls</l>
       <l n="213">On the empty lodge , and the winds subvert deserted walls . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="214">Therewithal , to the fuel , he laid the glowing coal ;</l>
       <l n="215">And the redness ran in the mass and burrowed within like a mole ,</l>
       <l n="216">And copious smoke was conceived . But , as when a dam is to burst ,</l>
       <l n="217">The water lips it and crosses in silver trickles at first ,</l>
       <l n="218">And then , of a sudden , whelms and bears it away forthright ;</l>
       <l n="219">So now , in a moment , the flame sprang and towered in the night ,</l>
       <l n="220">And wrestled and roared in the wind , and high over house and tree ,</l>

      <head>RAHÉRO</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Rahéro was there in the hall asleep : beside him his wife ,</l>
       <l n="2">Comely , a mirthful woman , one that delighted in life ;</l>
       <l n="3">And a girl that was ripe for marriage , shy and sly as a mouse ;</l>
       <l n="4">And a boy , a climber of trees : all the hopes of his house .</l>
       <l n="5">Unwary , with open hands , he slept in the midst of his folk ,</l>
       <l n="6">And dreamed that he heard a voice crying without , and awoke ,</l>
       <l n="7">Leaping blindly afoot like one from a dream that he fears .</l>
       <l n="8">A hellish glow and clouds were about him ;— it roared in his ears</l>
       <l n="9">Like the sound of the cataract fall that plunges sudden and steep ;</l>
       <l n="10">And Rahéro swayed as he stood , and his reason was still asleep .</l>
       <l n="11">Now the flame struck hard on the house , wind-wielded , a fracturing blow ,</l>
       <l n="12">And the end of the roof was burst and fell on the sleepers below ;</l>
       <l n="13">And the lofty hall , and the feast , and the prostrate bodies of folk ,</l>
       <l n="14">Shone red in his eyes a moment , and then were swallowed of smoke .</l>
       <l n="15">In the mind of Rahéro clearness came ; and he opened his throat ;</l>
       <l n="16">And as when a squall comes sudden , the straining sail of a boat</l>
       <l n="17">Thunders aloud and bursts , so thundered the voice of the man .</l>
       <l n="18">— “ The wind and the rain ! ” he shouted , the mustering word of the</l>
       <l n="19">clan ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span></l>
       <l n="20">And “ Up ! ” and “ To arms , men of Vaiau ! ” But silence replied ,</l>
       <l n="21">Or only the voice of the gusts of the fire , and nothing beside .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="22">Rahéro stooped and groped . He handled his womankind ,</l>
       <l n="23">But the fumes of the fire and the kava had quenched the life of their</l>
       <l n="24">mind ,</l>
       <l n="25">And they lay like pillars prone ; and his hand encountered the boy ,</l>
       <l n="26">And there sprang in the gloom of his soul a sudden lightning of joy .</l>
       <l n="27">“ Him can I save ! ” he thought , “ if I were speedy enough . ”</l>
       <l n="28">And he loosened the cloth from his loins , and swaddled the child in the</l>
       <l n="29">stuff :</l>
       <l n="30">And about the strength of his neck he knotted the burden well .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="31">There where the roof had fallen , it roared like the mouth of hell .</l>
       <l n="32">Thither Rahéro went , stumbling on senseless folk ,</l>
       <l n="33">And grappled a post of the house , and began to climb in the smoke :</l>
       <l n="34">The last alive of Vaiau ; and the son borne by the sire .</l>
       <l n="35">The post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire ,</l>
       <l n="36">And the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and thighs ;</l>
       <l n="37">And the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his eyes ;</l>
       <l n="38">And still he climbed , and came to the top , the place of proof ,</l>
       <l n="39">And thrust a hand through the flame , and clambered alive on the roof .</l>
       <l n="40">But even as he did so , the wind , in a garment of flames and pain ,</l>
       <l n="41">Wrapped him from head to heel ; and the waistcloth parted in twain ;</l>
       <l n="42">And the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="43">About the blazing feast-house clustered the eyes of the foe ,</l>
       <l n="44">Watching , hand upon weapon , lest ever a soul should flee ,</l>
       <l n="45">Shading the brow from the glare , straining the neck to see .</l>
       <l n="46">Only , to leeward , the flames in the wind swept far and wide ,</l>
       <l n="47">And the forest sputtered on fire ; and there might no man abide .</l>
       <l n="48">Thither Rahéro crept , and dropped from the burning eaves ,</l>
       <l n="49">And crouching low to the ground , in a treble covert of leaves</l>
       <l n="50">And fire and volleying smoke , ran for the life of his soul</l>
       <l n="51">Unseen ; and behind him under a furnace of ardent coal ,</l>
       <l n="52">Cairned with a wonder of flame , and blotting the night with smoke ,</l>
       <l n="53">Blazed and were smelted together the bones of all his folk .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="54">He fled unguided at first ; but hearing the breakers roar ,</l>
       <l n="55">Thitherward shaped his way , and came at length to the shore .</l>
       <l n="56">Sound-limbed he was : dry-eyed ; but smarted in every part ;</l>
       <l n="57">And the mighty cage of his ribs heaved on his straining heart</l>
       <l n="58">With sorrow and rage . And “ Fools ! ” he cried , “ fools of Vaiau ,</l>
       <l n="59">Heads of swine — gluttons — Alas ! and where are they now ?</l>
       <l n="60">Those that I played with , those that nursed me , those that I nursed ?</l>
       <l n="61">God , and I outliving them ! I , the least and the worst —</l>
       <l n="62">I , that thought myself crafty , snared by this herd of swine ,</l>
       <l n="63">In the tortures of hell and desolate , stripped of all that was mine :</l>
       <l n="64">All !— my friends and my fathers — the silver heads of yore</l>
       <l n="65">That trooped to the council , the children that ran to the open door</l>
       <l n="66">Crying with innocent voices and clasping a father 's knees !</l>
       <l n="67">And mine , my wife — my daughter — my sturdy climber of trees ,</l>
       <l n="68">Ah , never to climb again ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="69">Thus in the dusk of the night</l>
       <l n="70">( For clouds rolled in the sky and the moon was swallowed from sight ) ,</l>
       <l n="71">Pacing and gnawing his fists , Rahéro raged by the shore .</l>
       <l n="72">Vengeance : that must be his . But much was to do before ;</l>
       <l n="73">And first a single life to be snatched from a deadly place ,</l>
       <l n="74">A life , the root of revenge , surviving plant of the race :</l>
       <l n="75">And next the race to be raised anew , and the lands of the clan</l>
       <l n="76">Repeopled . So Rahéro designed , a prudent man</l>
       <l n="77">Even in wrath , and turned for the means of revenge and escape :</l>
       <l n="78">A boat to be seized by stealth , a wife to be taken by rape .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="79">Still was the dark lagoon ; beyond on the coral wall ,</l>
       <l n="80">He saw the breakers shine , he heard them bellow and fall .</l>
       <l n="81">Alone , on the top of the reef , a man with a flaming brand</l>
       <l n="82">Walked , gazing and pausing , a fish-spear poised in his hand .</l>
       <l n="83">The foam boiled to his calf when the mightier breakers came ,</l>
       <l n="84">And the torch shed in the wind scattering tufts of flame</l>
       <l n="85">Afar on the dark lagoon a canoe lay idly at wait :</l>
       <l n="86">A figure dimly guiding it : surely the fisherman 's mate .</l>
       <l n="87">Rahéro saw and he smiled . He straightened his mighty thews :</l>
       <l n="88">Naked , with never a weapon , and covered with scorch and bruise ,</l>
       <l n="89">He straightened his arms , he filled the void of his body with breath ,</l>
       <l n="90">And , strong as the wind in his manhood , doomed the fisher to death .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="91">Silent he entered the water , and silently swam , and came</l>
       <l n="92">There where the fisher walked , holding on high the flame .</l>
       <l n="93">Loud on the pier of the reef volleyed the breach of the sea ;</l>
       <l n="94">And hard at the back of the man , Rahéro crept to his knee</l>
       <l n="95">On the coral , and suddenly sprang and seized him , the elder hand</l>
       <l n="96">Clutching the joint of his throat , the other snatching the brand</l>
       <l n="97">Ere it had time to fall , and holding it steady and high .</l>
       <l n="98">Strong was the fisher , brave , and swift of mind and of eye —</l>
       <l n="99">Strongly he threw in the clutch ; but Rahéro resisted the strain ,</l>
       <l n="100">And jerked , and the spine of life snapped with a crack in twain ,</l>
       <l n="101">And the man came slack in his hands and tumbled a lump at his feet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="102">One moment : and there , on the reef , where the breakers whitened and</l>
       <l n="103">beat ,</l>
       <l n="104">Rahéro was standing alone , glowing , and scorched and bare ,</l>
       <l n="105">A victor unknown of any , raising the torch in the air .</l>
       <l n="106">But once he drank of his breath , and instantly set him to fish</l>
       <l n="107">Like a man intent upon supper at home and a savoury dish .</l>
       <l n="108">For what should the woman have seen ? A man with a torch — and then</l>
       <l n="109">A moment 's blur of the eyes — and a man with a torch again .</l>
       <l n="110">And the torch had scarcely been shaken . “ Ah , surely , ” Rahéro said ,</l>
       <l n="111">“ She will deem it a trick of the eyes , a fancy born in the head ;</l>
       <l n="112">But time must be given the fool to nourish a fool 's belief . ”</l>
       <l n="113">So for a while , a sedulous fisher , he walked the reef ,</l>
       <l n="114">Pausing at times and gazing , striking at times with the spear :</l>
       <l n="115">— Lastly , uttered the call ; and even as the boat drew near ,</l>
       <l n="116">Like a man that was done with its use , tossed the torch in the sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="117">Lightly he leaped on the boat beside the woman ; and she</l>
       <l n="118">Lightly addressed him , and yielded the paddle and place to sit ;</l>
       <l n="119">For now the torch was extinguished the night was black as the pit .</l>
       <l n="120">Rahéro set him to row , never a word he spoke ,</l>
       <l n="121">And the boat sang in the water urged by his vigorous stroke .</l>
       <l n="122">— “ What ails you ? ” the woman asked , “ and why did you drop the brand ?</l>
       <l n="123">We have only to kindle another as soon as we come to land . ”</l>
       <l n="124">Never a word Rahéro replied , but urged the canoe .</l>
       <l n="125">And a chill fell on the woman .— “ Atta ! speak ! is it you ?</l>
       <l n="126">Speak ! Why are you silent ? Why do you bend aside ?</l>
       <l n="127">Wherefore steer to the seaward ? ” thus she panted and cried .</l>
       <l n="128">Never a word from the oarsman , toiling there in the dark ;</l>
       <l n="129">But right for a gate of the reef he silently headed the bark ,</l>
       <l n="130">And wielding the single paddle with passionate sweep on sweep ,</l>
       <l n="131">Drove her , the little fitted , forth on the open deep .</l>
       <l n="132">And fear , there where she sat , froze the woman to stone :</l>
       <l n="133">Not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone ;</l>
       <l n="134">But a keener fear of the night , the dark , and the ghostly hour ,</l>
       <l n="135">And the thing that drove the canoe with more than a mortal 's power</l>
       <l n="136">And more than a mortal 's boldness . For much she knew of the dead</l>
       <l n="137">That haunt and fish upon reefs , toiling , like men , for bread ,</l>
       <l n="138">And traffic with human fishers , or slay them and take their ware ,</l>
       <l n="139">Till the hour when the star of the dead<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>goes down , and the morning</l>
       <l n="140">air</l>
       <l n="141">Blows , and the cocks are singing on shore . And surely she knew</l>
       <l n="142">The speechless thing at her side belonged to the grave .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span></l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="143">It blew</l>
       <l n="144">All night from the south ; all night , Rahéro contended and kept</l>
       <l n="145">The prow to the cresting sea ; and , silent as though she slept ,</l>
       <l n="146">The woman huddled and quaked . And now was the peep of day .</l>
       <l n="147">High and long on their left the mountainous island lay ;</l>
       <l n="148">And over the peaks of Taiárapu arrows of sunlight struck .</l>
       <l n="149">On shore the birds were beginning to sing : the ghostly ruck</l>
       <l n="150">Of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave ;</l>
       <l n="151">And here on the sea , the woman , waxing suddenly brave ,</l>
       <l n="152">Turned her swiftly about and looked in the face of the man .</l>
       <l n="153">And sure he was none that she knew , none of her country or clan :</l>
       <l n="154">A stranger , mother-naked , and marred with the marks of fire ,</l>
       <l n="155">But comely and great of stature , a man to obey and admire .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="156">And Rahéro regarded her also , fixed , with a frowning face ,</l>
       <l n="157">Judging the woman 's fitness to mother a warlike race .</l>
       <l n="158">Broad of shoulder , ample of girdle , long in the thigh ,</l>
       <l n="159">Deep of bosom she was , and bravely supported his eye .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="160">“ Woman , ” said he , “ last night the men of your folk —</l>
       <l n="161">Man , woman , and maid , smothered my race in smoke .</l>
       <l n="162">It was done like cowards ; and I , a mighty man of my hands ,</l>
       <l n="163">Escaped , a single life ; and now to the empty lands</l>
       <l n="164">And smokeless hearths of my people , sail , with yourself , alone .</l>
       <l n="165">Before your mother was born , the die of to-day was thrown</l>
       <l n="166">And you selected :— your husband , vainly striving , to fall</l>
       <l n="167">Broken between these hands :— yourself to be severed from all ,</l>
       <l n="168">The places , the people , you love — home , kindred , and clan —</l>

       <l n="53">Only the chiefs and the priest talked and consulted a while :</l>

       <l n="58">Sheer from the trees of the valley the face of the mountain sprang ;</l>
       <l n="59">Sheer and bare it rose , unscalable barricade ,</l>
       <l n="60">Beaten and blown against by the generous draught of the trade .</l>
       <l n="61">Dawn on its fluted brow painted rainbow light ,</l>
       <l n="62">Close on its pinnacled crown trembled the stars at night .</l>
       <l n="63">Here and there in a cleft clustered contorted trees ,</l>
       <l n="64">Or the silver beard of a stream hung and swung in the breeze ,</l>
       <l n="65">High overhead , with a cry , the torrents leaped for the main ,</l>
       <l n="66">And silently sprinkled below in thin perennial rain .</l>
       <l n="67">Dark in the staring noon , dark was Rua 's ravine ,</l>
       <l n="68">Damp and cold was the air , and the face of the cliffs was green .</l>
       <l n="69">Here , in the rocky pit , accursed already of old ,</l>
       <l n="70">On a stone in the midst of a river , Rua sat and was cold .</l>

       <l n="76">Whence he beheld the woods , and the sea , and houses of men .</l>
       <l n="77">Wide blew the riotous trade , and smelt in his nostrils good ;</l>
       <l n="78">It bowed the boats on the bay , and tore and divided the wood ;</l>
       <l n="79">It smote and sundered the groves as Moses smote with the rod ,</l>
       <l n="80">And the streamers of all the trees blew like banners abroad ;</l>
       <l n="81">And ever and on , in a lull , the trade-wind brought him along</l>
       <l n="82">A far-off patter of drums and a far-off whisper of song .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="83">Swift as the swallow 's wings , the diligent hands on the drum</l>
       <l n="84">Fluttered and hurried and throbbed . “ Ah , woe that I hear you come , ”</l>
       <l n="85">Rua cried in his grief , “ a sorrowful sound to me ,</l>
       <l n="86">Mounting far and faint from the resonant shore of the sea !</l>
       <l n="87">Woe in the song ! for the grave breathes in the singers ’ breath ,</l>
       <l n="88">And I hear in the tramp of the drums the beat of the heart of death .</l>
       <l n="89">Home of my youth ! no more through all the length of the years ,</l>
       <l n="90">No more to the place of the echoes of early laughter and tears ,</l>
       <l n="91">No more shall Rua return ; no more as the evening ends ,</l>
       <l n="92">To crowded eyes of welcome , to the reaching hands of friends . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="93">All day long from the High-place the drums and the singing came ,</l>
       <l n="94">And the even fell , and the sun went down , a wheel of flame ;</l>
       <l n="95">And night came gleaning the shadows and hushing the sounds of the wood ;</l>
       <l n="96">And silence slept on all , where Rua sorrowed and stood .</l>
       <l n="97">But still from the shore of the bay the sound of the festival rang ,</l>
       <l n="98">And still the crowd in the High-place danced and shouted and sang .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="99">Now over all the isle terror was breathed abroad</l>
       <l n="100">Of shadowy hands from the trees and shadowy snares in the sod ;</l>
       <l n="101">And before the nostrils of night , the shuddering hunter of men</l>
       <l n="102">Hurried , with beard on shoulder , back to his lighted den .</l>
       <l n="103">“ Taheia , here to my side ! ” — “ Rua , my Rua , you ! ”</l>
       <l n="104">And cold from the clutch of terror , cold with the damp of the dew ,</l>
       <l n="105">Taheia , heavy of hair , leaped through the dark to his arms ;</l>
       <l n="106">Taheia leaped to his clasp , and was folded in from alarms .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="107">“ Rua , beloved , here , see what your love has brought ;</l>
       <l n="108">Coming — alas ! returning — swift as the shuttle of thought ;</l>
       <l n="109">Returning , alas ! for to-night , with the beaten drum and the voice ,</l>
       <l n="110">In the shine of many torches must the sleepless clan rejoice ;</l>
       <l n="111">And Taheia the well-descended , the daughter of chief and priest ,</l>
       <l n="112">Taheia must sit in her place in the crowded bench of the feast . ”</l>
       <l n="113">So it was spoken ; and she , girding her garment high ,</l>
       <l n="114">Fled and was swallowed of woods , swift as the sight of an eye .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="115">Night over isle and sea rolled her curtain of stars ,</l>
       <l n="116">Then a trouble awoke in the air , the east was banded with bars ;</l>
       <l n="117">Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height ;</l>
       <l n="118">Dawn , in the deepest glen , fell a wonder of light ;</l>
       <l n="119">High and clear stood the palms in the eye of the brightening east ,</l>
       <l n="120">And lo ! from the sides of the sea the broken sound of the feast !</l>
       <l n="121">As , when in days of summer , through open windows , the fly</l>
       <l n="122">Swift as a breeze and loud as a trump goes by ,</l>
       <l n="123">But when frosts in the field have pinched the wintering mouse ,</l>
       <l n="124">Blindly noses and buzzes and hums in the firelit house :</l>
       <l n="125">So the sound of the feast gallantly trampled at night ,</l>
       <l n="126">So it staggered and drooped , and droned in the morning light .</l>

      <head>THE RAID</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It chanced that as Rua sat in the valley of silent falls</l>
       <l n="2">He heard a calling of doves from high on the cliffy walls .</l>
       <l n="3">Fire had fashioned of yore , and time had broken , the rocks ;</l>
       <l n="4">There were rooting crannies for trees and nesting-places for flocks ;</l>
       <l n="5">And he saw on the top of the cliffs , looking up from the pit of the</l>
       <l n="6">shade ,</l>
       <l n="7">A flicker of wings and sunshine , and trees that swung in the trade .</l>
       <l n="8">“ The trees swing in the trade , ” quoth Rua , doubtful of words ,</l>
       <l n="9">“ And the sun stares from the sky , but what should trouble the birds ? ”</l>
       <l n="10">Up from the shade he gazed , where high the parapet shone ,</l>
       <l n="11">And he was aware of a ledge and of things that moved thereon .</l>
       <l n="12">“ What manner of things are these ? Are they spirits abroad by day ?</l>
       <l n="13">Or the foes of my clan that are come , bringing death by a perilous way ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="14">The valley was gouged like a vessel , and round like the vessel 's lip ,</l>
       <l n="15">With a cape of the side of the hill thrust forth like the bows of a</l>
       <l n="16">ship .</l>
       <l n="17">On the top of the face of the cape a volley of sun struck fair ,</l>
       <l n="18">And the cape overhung like a chin a gulf of sunless air .</l>
       <l n="19">“ Silence , heart ! What is that ?— that , which flickered and shone ,</l>
       <l n="20">Into the sun for an instant , and in an instant gone ?</l>
       <l n="21">Was it a warrior 's plume , a warrior 's girdle of hair ?</l>
       <l n="22">Swung in the loop of a rope , is he making a bridge of the air ? ”</l>
       <l n="23">Once and again Rua saw , in the trenchant edge of the sky ,</l>
       <l n="24">The giddy conjuring done . And then , in the blink of an eye ,</l>
       <l n="25">A scream caught in with the breath , a whirling packet of limbs ,</l>
       <l n="26">A lump that dived in the gulf , more swift than a dolphin swims ;</l>
       <l n="27">And there was a lump at his feet , and eyes were alive in the lump .</l>
       <l n="28">Sick was the soul of Rua , ambushed close in a clump ;</l>
       <l n="29">Sick of soul he drew near , making his courage stout ;</l>
       <l n="30">And he looked in the face of the thing , and the life of the thing went</l>
       <l n="31">out .</l>
       <l n="32">And he gazed on the tattooed limbs , and , behold , he knew the man :</l>
       <l n="33">Hoka , a chief of the Vais , the truculent foe of his clan :</l>
       <l n="34">Hoka a moment since that stepped in the loop of the rope ,</l>
       <l n="35">Filled with the lust of war , and alive with courage and hope .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="36">Again to the giddy cornice Rua lifted his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="37">And again beheld men passing in the armpit of the skies .</l>
       <l n="38">“ Foes of my race ! ” cried Rua , “ the mouth of Rua is true :</l>
       <l n="39">Never a shark in the deep is nobler of soul than you .</l>
       <l n="40">There was never a nobler foray , never a bolder plan ;</l>
       <l n="41">Never a dizzier path was trod by the children of man ;</l>
       <l n="42">And Rua , your evil-doer through all the days of his years ,</l>
       <l n="43">Counts it honour to hate you , honour to fall by your spears . ”</l>
       <l n="44">And Rua straightened his back . “ O Vais , a scheme for a scheme ! ”</l>
       <l n="45">Cried Rua and turned and descended the turbulent stair of the stream ,</l>
       <l n="46">Leaping from rock to rock as the water-wagtail at home</l>
       <l n="47">Flits through resonant valleys and skims by boulder and foam .</l>
       <l n="48">And Rua burst from the glen and leaped on the shore of the brook ,</l>
       <l n="49">And straight for the roofs of the clan his vigorous way he took .</l>
       <l n="50">Swift were the heels of his flight , and loud behind as he went</l>
       <l n="51">Rattled the leaping stones on the line of his long descent .</l>
       <l n="52">And ever he thought as he ran , and caught at his gasping breath ,</l>
       <l n="53">“ O the fool of a Rua , Rua that runs to his death !</l>
       <l n="54">But the right is the right , ” thought Rua , and ran like the wind on the</l>
       <l n="55">foam ,</l>
       <l n="56">“ The right is the right for ever , and home for ever home .</l>
       <l n="57">For what though the oven smoke ? And what though I die ere morn ?</l>
       <l n="58">There was I nourished and tended , and there was Taheia born . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="59">Noon was high on the High-place , the second noon of the feast ;</l>
       <l n="60">And heat and shameful slumber weighed on people and priest ;</l>
       <l n="61">And the heart drudged slow in bodies heavy with monstrous meals ;</l>
       <l n="62">And the senseless limbs were scattered abroad like spokes of wheels ;</l>
       <l n="63">And crapulous women sat and stared at the stones anigh</l>
       <l n="64">With a bestial droop of the lip and a swinish rheum in the eye .</l>
       <l n="65">As about the dome of the bees in the time for the drones to fall ,</l>
       <l n="66">The dead and the maimed are scattered , and lie , and stagger , and crawl ;</l>
       <l n="67">So on the grades of the terrace , in the ardent eye of the day ,</l>
       <l n="68">The half-awake and the sleepers clustered and crawled and lay ;</l>
       <l n="69">And loud as the dome of the bees , in the time of a swarming horde ,</l>
       <l n="70">A horror of many insects hung in the air and roared .</l>
       <l n="71">Rua looked and wondered ; he said to himself in his heart :</l>
       <l n="72">“ Poor are the pleasures of life , and death is the better part . ”</l>
       <l n="73">But lo ! on the higher benches a cluster of tranquil folk</l>
       <l n="74">Sat by themselves , nor raised their serious eyes , nor spoke :</l>
       <l n="75">Women with robes unruffled and garlands duly arranged ,</l>
       <l n="76">Gazing far from the feast with faces of people estranged ;</l>
       <l n="77">And quiet amongst the quiet , and fairer than all the fair ,</l>
       <l n="78">Taheia , the well-descended , Taheia , heavy of hair .</l>
       <l n="79">And the soul of Rua awoke , courage enlightened his eyes</l>
       <l n="80">And he uttered a summoning shout and called on the clan to rise .</l>
       <l n="81">Over against him at once , in the spotted shade of the trees ,</l>
       <l n="82">Owlish and blinking creatures scrambled to hands and knees ;</l>
       <l n="83">On the grades of the sacred terrace , the driveller woke to fear ,</l>
       <l n="84">And the hand of the ham-drooped warrior brandished a wavering spear .</l>
       <l n="85">And Rua folded his arms , and scorn discovered his teeth ;</l>
       <l n="86">Above the war-crowd gibbered , and Rua stood smiling beneath .</l>
       <l n="87">Thick , like leaves in the autumn , faint , like April sleet ,</l>
       <l n="88">Missiles from tremulous hands quivered around his feet ;</l>
       <l n="89">And Taheia leaped from her place ; and the priest , the ruby-eyed ,</l>
       <l n="90">Ran to the front of the terrace , and brandished his arms and cried :</l>
       <l n="91">“ Hold , O fools , he brings tidings ! ” and “ Hold , ‘ tis the love of my</l>
       <l n="92">heart ! ”</l>
       <l n="93">Till lo ! in front of the terrace , Rua pierced with a dart .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="94">Taheia cherished his head , and the aged priest stood by ,</l>
       <l n="95">And gazed with eyes of ruby at Rua 's darkening eye .</l>
       <l n="96">“ Taheia , here is the end , I die a death for a man .</l>
       <l n="97">I have given the life of my soul to save an unsavable clan .</l>
       <l n="98">See them , the drooping of hams ! behold me the blinking crew ;</l>
       <l n="99">Fifty spears they cast , and one of fifty true !</l>
       <l n="100">And you , O priest , the foreteller , foretell for yourself if you can ,</l>
       <l n="101">Foretell the hour of the day when the Vais shall burst on your clan !</l>
       <l n="102">By the head of the tapu cleft , with death and fire in their hand ,</l>
       <l n="103">Thick and silent like ants , the warriors swarm in the land . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="104">And they tell that when next the sun had climbed to the noonday skies ,</l>

     <p>NOTES TO THE SONG OF RAHÉRO</p>
     <p>INTRODUCTION .— This tale , of which I have not consciously changed a single feature , I received from tradition . It is highly popular through all the country of the eight Tevas , the clan to which Rahéro belonged ; and particularly in Taiárapu , the windward peninsula of Tahiti , where he lived . I have heard from end to end two versions ; and as many as five different persons have helped me with details . There seems no reason why the tale should not be true .</p>
     <p>Note 1 , page 140 . “ The aito ” , quasi champion , or brave . One skilled in the use of some weapon , who wandered the country challenging distinguished rivals and taking part in local quarrels . It was in the natural course of his advancement to be at last employed by a chief , or king ; and it would then be a part of his duties to purvey the victim for sacrifice . One of the doomed families was indicated ; the aito took his weapon and went forth alone ; a little behind him bearers followed with the sacrificial basket . Sometimes the victim showed fight , sometimes prevailed ; more often , without doubt , he fell . But whatever body was found , the bearers indifferently took up .</p>
     <p>Note 2 , page 141 . “ Pai ” , “ Honoura ” , and “ Ahupu ” . Legendary persons of Tahiti , all natives of Taiárapu . Of the first two I have collected singular although imperfect legends , which I hope soon to lay before the public in another place . Of Ahupu , except in snatches of song , little memory appears to linger . She dwelt at least about Tepari ,— “ the sea-cliffs , ” — the eastern fastness of the isle ; walked by paths known only to herself upon the mountains ; was courted by dangerous suitors who came swimming from adjacent islands , and defended and rescued ( as I gather ) by the loyalty of native fish . My anxiety to learn more of “ Ahupu Vehine ” became ( during my stay in Taiárapu ) a cause of some diversion to that mirthful people , the inhabitants .</p>
     <p>Note 3 , page 142 . “ Covered an oven . ” The cooking fire is made in a hole in the ground , and is then buried .</p>
     <p>Note 4 , page 143 . “ Flies . ” This is perhaps an anachronism . Even speaking of to-day in Tahiti , the phrase would have to be understood as referring mainly to mosquitoes , and these only in watered valleys with close woods , such as I suppose to form the surroundings of Rahéro 's homestead . A quarter of a mile away , where the air moves freely , you shall look in vain for one .</p>
     <p>Note 5 , page 144 . “ Hook ” of mother-of-pearl . Bright-hook fishing , and that with the spear , appear to be the favourite native methods .</p>
     <p>Note 6 , page 145 . “ Leaves , ” the plates of Tahiti .</p>
     <p>Note 7 , page 146 . “ Yottowas , ” so spelt for convenience of pronunciation , quasi Tacksmen in the Scottish Highlands . The organisation of eight sub-districts and eight yottowas to a division , which was in use ( until yesterday ) among the Tevas , I have attributed without authority to the next clan ( see page 155 ) .</p>
     <p>Note 8 , page 146 . “ Omare , ” pronounce as a dactyl . A loaded quarterstaff , one of the two favourite weapons of the Tahitian brave ; the javelin , or casting spear , was the other .</p>
     <p>Note 9 , page 148 . “ The ribbon of light . ” Still to be seen ( and heard ) spinning from one marae to another on Tahiti ; or so I have it upon evidence that would rejoice the Psychical Society .</p>
     <p>Note 10 , page 149 . “ Námunu-úra . ” The complete name is Námunu-úra te aropa . Why it should be pronounced Námunu , dactylically , I cannot see , but so I have always heard it . This was the clan immediately beyond the Tevas on the south coast of the island . At the date of the tale the clan organisation must have been very weak . There is no particular mention of Támatéa 's mother going to Pápara , to the head chief of her own clan , which would appear her natural recourse . On the other hand , she seems to have visited various lesser chiefs among the Tevas , and these to have excused themselves solely on the danger of the enterprise . The broad distinction here drawn between Nateva and Námunu-úra is therefore not impossibly anachronistic .</p>
     <p>Note 11 , page 149 . “ Hiopa the king . ” Hiopa was really the name of the king ( chief ) of Vaiau ; but I could never learn that of the king of Paea — pronounce to rhyme with the Indian ayah — and I gave the name where it was most needed . This note must appear otiose indeed to readers who have never heard of either of these two gentlemen ; and perhaps there is only one person in the world capable at once of reading my verses and spying the inaccuracy . For him , for Mr. Tati Salmon , hereditary high chief of the Tevas , the note is solely written : a small attention from a clansman to his chief .</p>
     <p>Note 12 , page 150 . “ Let the pigs be tapu . ” It is impossible to explain tapu in a note ; we have it as an English word , taboo . Suffice it , that a thing which was tapu must not be touched , nor a place that was tapu visited .</p>
     <p>Note 13 , page 155 . “ Fish , the food of desire . ” There is a special word in the Tahitian language to signify hungering after fish . I may remark that here is one of my chief difficulties about the whole story . How did king , commons , women , and all come to eat together at this feast ? But it troubled none of my numerous authorities ; so there must certainly be some natural explanation .</p>
     <p>Note 14 , page 160 . “ The mustering word of the clan . ”</p>

     <p>Notes 15 and 16 , page 165 . “ The star of the dead . ” Venus as a morning star . I have collected much curious evidence as to this belief . The dead retain their taste for a fish diet , enter into copartnery with living fishers , and haunt the reef and the lagoon . The conclusion attributed to the nameless lady of the legend would be reached to-day , under the like circumstances , by ninety per cent . of Polynesians : and here I probably under-state by one-tenth .</p>

      <head>NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE</head>
      <head>In this ballad I have strung together some of the more striking particularities of the Marquesas . It rests upon no authority ; it is in no sense , like “ Rahéro , ” a native story ; but a patchwork of details of manners and the impressions of a traveller . It may seem strange , when the scene is laid upon these profligate islands , to make the story hinge on love . But love is not less known in the Marquesas than elsewhere ; nor is there any cause of suicide more common in the islands .</head>
       <l n="1">Note 1 , page 169 . “ Pit of popoi . ” Where the bread-fruit was stored for</l>
       <l n="2">preservation .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Note 2 , page 169 . “ Ruby-red . ” The priest 's eyes were probably red from the abuse of kava . His beard ( ib . ) is said to be worth an estate ; for the beards of old men are the favourite head-adornment of the Marquesans , as the hair of women formed their most costly girdle . The former , among this generally beardless and short-lived people , fetch to-day considerable sums .</p>
     <p>Note 3 , page 169 . “ Tikis . ” The tiki is an ugly image hewn out of wood or stone .</p>
     <p>Note 4 , page 172 . “ The one-stringed harp . ” Usually employed for serenades .</p>
     <p>Note 5 , page 173 . “ The sacred cabin of palm . ” Which , however , no woman could approach . I do not know where women were tattooed ; probably in the common house , or in the bush , for a woman was a creature of small account . I must guard the reader against supposing Taheia was at all disfigured ; the art of the Marquesan tattooer is extreme ; and she would appear to be clothed in a web of lace , inimitably delicate , exquisite in pattern , and of a bluish hue that at once contrasts and harmonises with the warm pigment of the native skin . It would be hard to find a woman more becomingly adorned than “ a well-tattooed ” Marquesan .</p>
     <p>Note 6 , page 175 . “ The horror of night . ” The Polynesian fear of ghosts and of the dark has been already referred to . Their life is beleaguered by the dead .</p>
     <p>Note 7 , page 176 . “ The quiet passage of souls . ” So , I am told , the natives explain the sound of a little wind passing overhead unfelt .</p>
     <p>Note 8 , page 178 . “ The first of the victims fell . ” Without doubt , this whole scene is untrue to fact . The victims were disposed of privately and some time before . And indeed I am far from claiming the credit of any high degree of accuracy for this ballad . Even in the time of famine , it is probable that Marquesan life went far more gaily than is here represented . But the melancholy of to-day lies on the writer 's mind .</p>

      <head>NOTES TO TICONDEROGA</head>
      <head>INTRODUCTION .— I first heard this legend of my own country from that friend of men of letters , Mr. Alfred Nutt , “ there in roaring London 's central stream , ” and since the ballad first saw the light of day in Scribner 's Magazine , Mr. Nutt and Lord Archibald Campbell have been in public controversy on the facts . Two clans , the Camerons and the Campbells , lay claim to this bracing story ; and they do well : the man who preferred his plighted troth to the commands and menaces of the dead is an ancestor worth disputing . But the Campbells must rest content : they have the broad lands and the broad page of history ; this appanage must be denied them ; for between the name of Cameron and that of Campbell the muse will never hesitate .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Note 1 , page 191 . Mr. Nutt reminds me it was “ by my sword and Ben</l>
       <l n="2">Cruachan ” the Cameron swore .</l>

      </lg>

     <p>Note 3 , page 195 . “ Cathay . ” There must be some omission in General Stewart 's charming “ History of the Highland Regiments , ” a book that might well be republished and continued ; or it scarce appears how our friend could have got to China .</p>
     <p>NOTE TO HEATHER ALE</p>
     <p>Among the curiosities of human nature this legend claims a high place . It is needless to remind the reader that the Picts were never exterminated , and form to this day a large proportion of the folk of Scotland , occupying the eastern and the central parts , from the Firth of Forth , or perhaps the Lammermoors , upon the south , to the Ord of Caithness on the north . That the blundering guess of a dull chronicler should have inspired men with imaginary loathing for their own ancestors is already strange ; that it should have begotten this wild legend seems incredible . Is it possible the chronicler 's error was merely nominal ? that what he told , and what the people proved themselves so ready to receive , about the Picts , was true or partly true of some anterior and perhaps Lappish savages , small of stature , black of hue , dwelling underground — possibly also the distillers of some forgotten spirit ? See Mr. Campbell 's “ Tales of the West Highlands . ”</p>

       <l n="1">Do you remember — can we e'er forget ?—</l>
       <l n="2">How , in the coiled perplexities of youth ,</l>
       <l n="3">In our wild climate , in our scowling town ,</l>
       <l n="4">We gloomed and shivered , sorrowed , sobbed and feared ?</l>
       <l n="5">The belching winter wind , the missile rain ,</l>
       <l n="6">The rare and welcome silence of the snows ,</l>
       <l n="7">The laggard morn , the haggard day , the night ,</l>
       <l n="8">The grimy spell of the nocturnal town ,</l>
       <l n="9">Do you remember ?— Ah , could one forget !</l>
       <l n="10">As when the fevered sick that all night long</l>
       <l n="11">Listed the wind intone , and hear at last</l>
       <l n="12">The ever-welcome voice of chanticleer</l>
       <l n="13">Sing in the bitter hour before the dawn ,—</l>
       <l n="14">With sudden ardour , these desire the day :</l>
       <l n="15">So sang in the gloom of youth the bird of hope ;</l>
       <l n="16">So we , exulting , hearkened and desired .</l>
       <l n="17">For lo ! as in the palace porch of life</l>
       <l n="18">We huddled with chimeras , from within —</l>
       <l n="19">How sweet to hear !— the music swelled and fell ,</l>
       <l n="20">And through the breach of the revolving doors</l>
       <l n="21">What dreams of splendour blinded us and fled !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="22">I have since then contended and rejoiced ;</l>
       <l n="23">Amid the glories of the house of life</l>
       <l n="24">Profoundly entered , and the shrine beheld :</l>
       <l n="25">Yet when the lamp from my expiring eyes</l>
       <l n="26">Shall dwindle and recede , the voice of love</l>
       <l n="27">Fall insignificant on my closing ears ,</l>
       <l n="28">What sound shall come but the old cry of the wind</l>
       <l n="29">In our inclement city ? what return</l>
       <l n="30">But the image of the emptiness of youth ,</l>
       <l n="31">Filled with the sound of footsteps and that voice</l>
       <l n="32">Of discontent and rapture and despair ?</l>
       <l n="33">So , as in darkness , from the magic lamp ,</l>
       <l n="34">The momentary pictures gleam and fade</l>
       <l n="35">And perish , and the night resurges — these</l>
       <l n="36">Shall I remember , and then all forget .</l>

     <note>At my departure from the island of Apemama , for which you will look in vain in most atlases , the King and I agreed , since we both set up to be in the poetical way , that we should celebrate our separation in verse . Whether or not his Majesty has been true to his bargain , the laggard posts of the Pacific may perhaps inform me in six months , perhaps not before a year . The following lines represent my part of the contract , and it is hoped , by their pictures of strange manners , they may entertain a civilised audience . Nothing throughout has been invented or exaggerated ; the lady herein referred to as the author 's muse has confined herself to stringing into rhyme facts or legends that I saw or heard during two months ’ residence upon the island .— R .
