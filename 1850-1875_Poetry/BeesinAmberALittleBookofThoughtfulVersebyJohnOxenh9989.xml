     <item>AUTHOR 'S APOLOGY</item>
     <item>In these rushful days an apology is advisable , if not absolutely essential , from any man , save the one or two elect , who has the temerity to publish a volume of verse .</item>
     <item>These stray lines , such as they are , have come to me from time to time , I hardly know how or whence ; certainly not of deliberate intention or of malice aforethought . More often than not they have come to the interruption of other , as it seemed to me , more important — and undoubtedly more profitable — work .</item>
     <item>They are for the most part , simply attempts at concrete and rememberable expression of ideas — ages old most of them — which “ asked for more . ”</item>
     <item>Most writers , I imagine , find themselves at times in that same predicament — worried by some thought which dances within them and stubbornly refuses to be satisfied with the sober dress of prose . For their own satisfaction and relief , in such a case , if they be not fools they endeavour to garb it more to its liking , and so find peace . Or , to vary the metaphor , they pluck the Bee out of their Bonnet and pop it into such amber as they happen to have about them or are able to evolve , and so put an end to its buzzing .</item>
     <item>In their previous states these little Bonnet-Bees of mine have apparently given pleasure to quite a number of intelligent and thoughtful folk ; and now — chiefly , I am bound to say , for my own satisfaction in seeing them all together — I have gathered them into one bunch .</item>
     <item>If they please you — good ! If not , there is no harm done , and one man is content .</item>

     <head>CREDO</head>
     <p>Not what , but WHOM , I do believe , That , in my darkest hour of need , Hath comfort that no mortal creed To mortal man may give ;— Not what , but WHOM ! For Christ is more than all the creeds , And His full life of gentle deeds Shall all the creeds outlive . Not what I do believe , but WHOM ! WHO walks beside me in the gloom ? WHO shares the burden wearisome ? WHO all the dim way doth illume , And bids me look beyond the tomb The larger life to live ?— Not what I do believe , BUT WHOM ! Not what , But WHOM !</p>

       <l n="3">But the souls of men fall into them and are powdered into dust ,</l>

       <l n="11">In sorrow the seeds are planted , they are watered with bitter tears ,</l>

       <l n="1">“ A little child shall lead them . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">I trod an arduous way , but came at last</l>
       <l n="3">To where the city walls rose fair and white</l>
       <l n="4">Above the darkening plain ,— a goodly sight .</l>
       <l n="5">And eagerly , while yet a great way off ,</l>
       <l n="6">My eyes did seek the Gates — the Great White Gates</l>
       <l n="7">That close not ever , day or night , but stand</l>
       <l n="8">Wide as the love of Christ that opened them .</l>
       <l n="9">But nought could I discern of gate or breach ,</l>
       <l n="10">The wall stood flawless far as eye could reach .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">“ But when I drew in closer to the wall ,</l>
       <l n="12">I saw a lowly portal , strait and small ;</l>
       <l n="13">So small , a man might hardly enter there ,</l>
       <l n="14">Low-browed and shadowed , and close-pressed to earth —</l>
       <l n="15">A very needle 's eye — scarce visible .</l>
       <l n="16">I looked and wondered . Could this trivial way</l>
       <l n="17">Be the sole entrance to the light of day ?</l>
       <l n="18">And as I stood perplext , a clear voice cried ,—</l>
       <l n="19">Come ! Enter in ! The Gate is open wide . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="20">And while I stood in doubt , there came along</l>
       <l n="21">One of earth 's mighty ones — a conqueror</l>
       <l n="22">Of Kings . He looked for gates that should swing wide</l>
       <l n="23">To meet his high estate and welcome him .</l>
       <l n="24">He stood and gazed , then raised his voice and cried ,</l>
       <l n="25">“ My work on earth is done . I would within , ”</l>
       <l n="26">And from the City wall the voice replied ,—</l>
       <l n="27">“ Come ! Enter in ! The Gate is open wide . ”</l>
       <l n="28">He stood perplext , then set himself to wait ,</l>

       <l n="30">Another came ,— a man of mind so rare ,</l>
       <l n="31">He scarce had breathed the common earthly air .</l>
       <l n="32">Knowledge was his , and wisdom so profound ,</l>
       <l n="33">All things he knew in heaven and earth . No bound</l>
       <l n="34">To his accomplishment , until he sought</l>
       <l n="35">The great wide-opened Gate ,— and found it not .</l>
       <l n="36">He stood perplext , and then cried wearily ,</l>
       <l n="37">“ Pray give me entrance . I am done with earth . ”</l>
       <l n="38">And from the City wall the clear voice cried ,—</l>
       <l n="39">“ Come ! Enter in ! The Gate is open wide . ”</l>
       <l n="40">He looked in vain , then set himself to wait ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="42">I saw a woman come , noble and fair ,</l>

       <l n="44">More richly robed than Fashion 's fairest queen .</l>
       <l n="45">And to myself I said ,— “ Surely for her</l>
       <l n="46">A way will open that she may go in ! ”</l>
       <l n="47">She said no word , but stood and looked upon</l>
       <l n="48">The shining walls , with eyes that answering shone .</l>
       <l n="49">And from the City wall the clear voice cried ,—</l>
       <l n="50">“ Come ! Enter in ! The Gate is open wide . ”</l>

       <l n="56">“ Entrance I crave , ” he cried , “ to well-earned rest ,—</l>

       <l n="64">Sought glorious entrance through wide-opened gates ,</l>
       <l n="65">And stood perplext . He had borne well his part ,</l>
       <l n="66">And served his people and his God , and died</l>
       <l n="67">The Martyr 's death , and yet he found no gate .</l>
       <l n="68">“ I fain would rest , ” he cried . “ My life has been</l>
       <l n="69">One ceaseless striving . I would enter in . ”</l>
       <l n="70">And from the City wall the clear voice cried ,—</l>

       <l n="90">And then — a child in white came carolling</l>
       <l n="91">Along the arduous road we all had trod .</l>
       <l n="92">He stopped and looked , then laughed with childish glee ,—</l>

       <l n="99">Of pure white samite , on her hands and knees</l>
       <l n="100">She crept into the doorway and was gone ,</l>

       <l n="102">And , one by one , they followed . First the Judge</l>

       <l n="104">And followed — where the little child had led .</l>
       <l n="105">And he whose brow had borne that weighty crown</l>
       <l n="106">Bent low and followed ,— where the little child had led .</l>
       <l n="107">And he who knew so much of earthly things</l>
       <l n="108">Discarded them , and , on his hands and knees ,</l>
       <l n="109">Crept through the doorway ,— where the little child had led .</l>

       <l n="111">And followed ,— where the little child had led .</l>
       <l n="112">And , last of all , the War Lord cast aside</l>
       <l n="113">His victor 's wreaths , and all his pomp and pride ,</l>
       <l n="114">And followed ,— where the little child had led .</l>

       <l n="10">Came one in royal robes and all the pride</l>
       <l n="11">And pomp of majesty , and on his head</l>
       <l n="12">A helmet with an eagle poised for flight .</l>
       <l n="13">He stood amazed at sight of him in white ,</l>
       <l n="14">His lips apart in haughty questioning .</l>
       <l n="15">But no words came . Breathless , he raised his hand</l>
       <l n="16">And gave salute as to a mightier lord ,</l>
       <l n="17">And doffed his helm , and stood . And in his eyes I saw</l>
       <l n="18">The reflex glory of his Master 's face .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="19">The Master spoke . His voice so soft and sweet</l>
       <l n="20">Thrilled my heart 's core and shook me where I stood ,—</l>
       <l n="21">“ Time runs apace . The New Time is at hand .</l>
       <l n="22">Shall it be Peace or War ? It rests with THEE . ”</l>
       <l n="23">In dumb amaze the other shook his head .</l>
       <l n="24">“ Thy brother of the North has cast his lot</l>
       <l n="25">For peace . Alone he cannot compass it .</l>
       <l n="26">Shall it be Peace or War ? It rests with THEE . ”</l>
       <l n="27">Again the other shook his head amazed ,</l>
       <l n="28">But never swerved a hair 's breadth in his gaze .</l>
       <l n="29">“ Shall it be Peace or War ? Join hands with him ,</l>
       <l n="30">Thy Northern brother , with the Western Isles ,</l>
       <l n="31">And with their brethren of the Further West ,</l>
       <l n="32">And Peace shall reign to Earth 's remotest bound . ”</l>
       <l n="33">And still the other shook his head amazed .</l>
       <l n="34">“ Shall it be Peace or War ? Millions of lives</l>
       <l n="35">Are in thy hand , women and men and those</l>
       <l n="36">My little ones . Their souls are mine . Their lives</l>
       <l n="37">Are in thy hand . Of thee I shall require them .</l>
       <l n="38">Shall it be Peace or War ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="39">“ I am but one , ”</l>
       <l n="40">The other answered with reluctant tongue .</l>
       <l n="41">“ Thou art THE one and so I come to thee .</l>
       <l n="42">For Peace or War the scales are in thy hand .</l>
       <l n="43">As thou decidest now , so shall it be .</l>
       <l n="44">But ,— as thou sayest now , so be it</l>
       <l n="45">With thee — then .</l>
       <l n="46">Shall it be Peace or War ? Nay — look !— ”</l>
       <l n="47">And at the word — where stood the wall — a space ;</l>
       <l n="48">And at their feet , like mighty map unrolled ,—</l>
       <l n="49">The kingdoms of the earth , and every kingdom</l>
       <l n="50">Groaned with the burden of its armour-plate .</l>
       <l n="51">And the weight grew till man was crushed beneath ,</l>
       <l n="52">And lost his manhood and became a cog</l>
       <l n="53">To roll along the great machine of war .</l>
       <l n="54">And , as he watched , the War-Lord 's eyes flamed fire ,</l>
       <l n="55">His nostrils panted like a mettled steed 's .</l>
       <l n="56">This was the game of games he knew and loved ,</l>
       <l n="57">And every fibre of his soul was knit</l>
       <l n="58">To see what passed .</l>
       <l n="59">Then ,— in a sun-white land ,</l>
       <l n="60">Where a great sea poured out through narrow gates</l>
       <l n="61">To meet a greater ,— came the clang of arms ,</l>
       <l n="62">And drew the nations like a tocsin peal ,</l>
       <l n="63">Till all the sun-white sands ran red , and earth</l>
       <l n="64">Sweat blood , and writhed in fiery ashes , and</l>
       <l n="65">Grew sick with all the reek and stench of war ,</l>
       <l n="66">And heaven drew back behind the battle-clouds .</l>
       <l n="67">And ever , through the clamour of the strife ,</l>
       <l n="68">I heard the ceaseless wailing of a child ,</l>
       <l n="69">And the sobbing , sobbing , sobbing , endless</l>
       <l n="70">Sobbing of a reft and broken woman ;—</l>
       <l n="71">And the hoarse whisper of the War-Lord 's voice ,—</l>
       <l n="72">“ Britain fights once again for Barbary</l>
       <l n="73">Lest others occupy to her undoing .</l>
       <l n="74">And Italy and Greece and Turkey join ,</l>
       <l n="75">To beat back France and Spain . ”</l>
       <l n="76">Again I saw ,—</l>
       <l n="77">Where legions marched and wound ‘ mid snowy peaks ,</l>
       <l n="78">And came upon a smiling vine-clad land ,</l>
       <l n="79">And filled it with the reek and stench of war .</l>
       <l n="80">The hoarse voice spoke ,—</l>
       <l n="81">“ The provinces she stole</l>
       <l n="82">And lost , Austria takes back . ”</l>
       <l n="83">Again I saw ,—</l>
       <l n="84">Where white-capped hosts crept swiftly to the straits</l>
       <l n="85">Twixt old and new , and drenched the land with blood ,</l>
       <l n="86">And filled it with the reek and stench of war .</l>
       <l n="87">The War-Lord spoke ,—</l>
       <l n="88">“ Despite his love of peace ,</l>
       <l n="89">Our brother of the North has seized his chance ,</l>
       <l n="90">And got his heart 's desire . ”</l>
       <l n="91">Again I saw ,—</l>
       <l n="92">Where legions poured through the eternal snows ,</l>
       <l n="93">And legions swept o'er every sea to meet</l>
       <l n="94">Their long-expected onslaught , and the dead</l>
       <l n="95">Were piled in mountains , and the snows ran red .</l>
       <l n="96">The War-Lord spoke ,—</l>
       <l n="97">“ Up , Britain , up ! Strike home !</l>
       <l n="98">Or drop your rod of Empire in the dust —</l>
       <l n="99">One of you dies this day . ”</l>
       <l n="100">Again I saw ,—</l>
       <l n="101">Beneath us , legions swarming to the West ,</l>
       <l n="102">Devouring kingdoms till they reached the sea ,</l>
       <l n="103">And filling all the lands with blood and fire .</l>
       <l n="104">The War-Lord gazed , with eyes that blazed and flamed ,</l>
       <l n="105">And panted like a soul in torment ,— “ Mine !</l>
       <l n="106">All these are mine ! ”</l>
       <l n="107">“ Thine , sayest thou ?— Thine now ,</l>
       <l n="108">When thou shalt stand before me — then ,</l>
       <l n="109">I shall require them of thee . ”</l>
       <l n="110">— Thus the voice</l>
       <l n="111">Of Him who sat and gazed with sorrowing face ,</l>
       <l n="112">While all the earth beneath us reeked of war ,</l>
       <l n="113">And heaven grew dim behind the battle-clouds .</l>
       <l n="114">And ever , through the clamour of the strife ,</l>
       <l n="115">I heard the ceaseless wailing of a child ,</l>
       <l n="116">And the sobbing , sobbing , sobbing , endless</l>
       <l n="117">Sobbing of a reft and broken woman .</l>
       <l n="118">“ Shall it be Peace or War ? ”</l>
       <l n="119">A two-edged sword</l>
       <l n="120">Could cut no sharper than the gentle voice</l>
       <l n="121">Of Him who bowed with sorrow at the sight</l>
       <l n="122">Of man destroying man for sake of gain .</l>
       <l n="123">I waited , breathless , for the warrior 's word .</l>
       <l n="124">But no word came . His heart was with his men .</l>
       <l n="125">“ Shall it be Peace or War ? Look yet again ! ”</l>
       <l n="126">And at their feet , like mighty map unrolled ,</l>
       <l n="127">Lay all the kingdoms of the earth — at peace .</l>
       <l n="128">The glad earth smiled beneath a smiling heaven ,</l>
       <l n="129">And brought forth fruit for all her children 's needs .</l>
       <l n="130">The desert lands had blossomed , and the earth</l>
       <l n="131">Was large enough for all . Her voice came up ,</l>
       <l n="132">A softly-rounded murmur of content ,</l>
       <l n="133">Like bees that labour gladly on the comb .</l>
       <l n="134">The reign of Peace ,— and yet an army lay</l>
       <l n="135">Couchant and watchful , ready for the strife</l>
       <l n="136">If strife need be ,— the strife of quelling strife ,—</l>
       <l n="137">An army culled in part from all the lands .</l>
       <l n="138">Owning no master but the public weal ,</l>
       <l n="139">And prompt to quench the first red spark of war .</l>
       <l n="140">Even as we watched , a frontier turmoil rose ,</l>
       <l n="141">And therewith rose the army , and the fire</l>
       <l n="142">Died out while scarce begun . The smoke of it</l>
       <l n="143">Was scarcely seen , the noise scarce heard ; for all</l>
       <l n="144">The lands , sore-spent with war , had welcomed Peace ,</l>
       <l n="145">And bowed to mightier forces than their own ;</l>
       <l n="146">Men cast aside their armour and their arms ,</l>
       <l n="147">And lived men 's lives and were no more machines .</l>
       <l n="148">“ Wars shall there be , indeed , till that last war</l>
       <l n="149">That shall wage war on War and sweep the earth</l>
       <l n="150">Of all war-wagers and of all mankind . ”</l>
       <l n="151">So spake the voice and ceased . And still we gazed ,—</l>
       <l n="152">A great white building , on its topmost tower</l>
       <l n="153">A great white flag , proclaimed a World 's Tribunal</l>
       <l n="154">For the righting of the nations ’ wrongs .</l>
       <l n="155">And that great army answered its behests</l>
       <l n="156">And owned allegiance to no other head .</l>
       <l n="157">Peace reigned triumphant . On the quiet air</l>
       <l n="158">I heard the merry laughter of the child ,</l>
       <l n="159">And the great sigh of gratitude that rose</l>
       <l n="160">From all the mother-hearts of all the world .</l>
       <l n="161">“ Shall it be Peace or War ? ” —</l>
       <l n="162">Once more the voice ,—</l>
       <l n="163">“ To one man is it given to decide ,</l>
       <l n="164">THOU ART THE MAN ! The scales are in THY hand .</l>
       <l n="165">Think well , and say ,— Shall it be Peace or War ?</l>
       <l n="166">As thou , shalt say so shall it be with thee . ”</l>
       <l n="167">But , ere the answer came , all vanished like</l>
       <l n="168">A scrap of paper in a fire of coals .</l>
       <l n="169">Then , with a crackling peal , the thick black vail</l>
       <l n="170">That hangs before the face of men was rent ,</l>
       <l n="171">And in the instant lightning flash I saw ,—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="172">A chamber hung with black and heaped with flowers ,</l>
       <l n="173">Where candles tall flashed white on watchers ’ swords .</l>
       <l n="174">High on a high-raised bier lay one at rest —</l>
       <l n="175">Crosses and orders on his quiet breast ,</l>
       <l n="176">Head proudly cushioned on his country 's flag ,</l>
       <l n="177">Hands calmly folded on his helmet 's crest ,</l>
       <l n="178">His back to earth , his mute face turned to heaven ,—</l>
       <l n="179">Answering the summons of his Over-Lord .</l>
       <l n="180">I strained my eyes upon his face to learn</l>
       <l n="181">Thereon his answer . But the dark vail dropped ,</l>
       <l n="182">And left me wondering what his word had been .</l>
       <l n="183">Had I but read his face I should have known</l>
       <l n="184">Who lay there .— Man , like other men ? Or one</l>
       <l n="185">Who grasped the greater things , and by his will</l>
       <l n="186">Brought Peace on Earth and drew Earth nearer Heaven .</l>
       <l n="187">The bells beat softly on the midnight air</l>
       <l n="188">Proclaiming the New Time ? Shall it be Peace ?</l>
       <l n="189">A voice within me cried and would not cease ,</l>
       <l n="190">“ One man could do it if he would but dare . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>NOTE .— This was written in 1898 , at the time of the Tzar 's Rescript to the Powers suggesting a Peace Conference with a view to the lightening of the ever-growing burden of arms .</p>
     <p>The possibilities have changed their faces , but at heart the great problem remains much the same . And above all , the great fact remains that if Great Britain , Germany , Russia and the United States joined hands for a World Peace , they could ensure it . Germany is still mistrustful . On her lies a great responsibility .</p>

     <head>KAPIOLANI IN RAROTONGAN</head>
     <p>Mr. F. W . Christian , of the Polynesian Society of New Zealand , whose personal acquaintance with the South Sea Islands and their dialects is unique , is translating “ Kapiolani ” into Rarotongan . He writes —</p>
     <p>“ I enclose a four-line stanza which , translating your first line — ‘ Where the great green combers break , ’ etc .— strictly according to East Polynesian ballad-metres , ushers in your great theme .</p>
     <p>“ ‘ Kapiolani ’ will , I trust , God willing , become a household classic in many of the Eastern Islands , such as Rapa and Manahiki , where the Rarotongan language runs current as a sort of Lingua Franca or Sacred Esperanto , thanks to the magnificent translation of the Bible by the great missionary , John Williams . I have translated the poem most carefully , and as accurately as possible into the peculiar metre and cast of expression which an Eastern Polynesian ‘ Atu-Pe'e , or Versifier , would immediately grasp as idiomatic . The first lines run thus :— ”</p>
