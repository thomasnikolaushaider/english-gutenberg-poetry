      <head>HYMN TO THE DEAD</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">O , you who have gone from the ways of cities ,</l>
       <l n="2">From the peopled places , the streets of strife ,</l>
       <l n="3">From offices , markets , rooms , retreats ,</l>
       <l n="4">Pastoral ways , hamlets , everywhere from the earth ,</l>
       <l n="5">And have made of the emptiness of your departure</l>
       <l n="6">A land , a country , a realm all your own ,</l>
       <l n="7">Set above the hills of our vision , an empire</l>
       <l n="8">Within , around , above our empire of days ,</l>
       <l n="9">Of pain and clamorous tongues ;</l>
       <l n="10">An empire which out of a sovereign silence</l>
       <l n="11">Stretches its power over the restless multitude</l>
       <l n="12">Of our thoughts , and the ceaseless music of our beings ,</l>
       <l n="13">And surrounds us even as the air we breathe —</l>
       <l n="14">O ye majestic Dead , hear our hymn !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">The clown , the wastrel and the fool in life</l>
       <l n="16">Are lifted up by you , O Death !</l>
       <l n="17">The least of these who has entered in</l>
       <l n="18">Your realm , O Death ,</l>
       <l n="19">Is greater than the greatest of us ,</l>
       <l n="20">And by a transfiguration has been clothed</l>
       <l n="21">With the glory and the wonder of nature .</l>
       <l n="22">He has drunk of the purple cup of apotheosis ,</l>
       <l n="23">And passed through the mystical change ,</l>
       <l n="24">And accomplished the cycle of being .</l>
       <l n="25">He has risen from the lowlands of earth</l>
       <l n="26">Into the air on wings of breath .</l>
       <l n="27">He has rejected the shell of the body , feet and hands ,</l>
       <l n="28">He has become one with the majesty of Time ,</l>
       <l n="29">And taken the kingdom of triumph</l>
       <l n="30">Whether it be cessation or bliss .</l>
       <l n="31">For he has entered into the kingdom of primal powers ,</l>
       <l n="32">Being or ceasing to be ,</l>
       <l n="33">Even as he has re-entered the womb of nature .</l>
       <l n="34">Or he has found peace ,</l>
       <l n="35">States of wisdom , or vision —</l>
       <l n="36">Hail ! realm of Silence ,</l>
       <l n="37">Whence comes the unheard symphony too deep for strings ,</l>
       <l n="38">Hail , infinite Light ,</l>
       <l n="39">Darkness to eyes of flesh —</l>
       <l n="40">All hail !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="41">What are we , the living , beside you the dead ?</l>
       <l n="42">We of daily hunger , daily food , daily ablutions ,</l>
       <l n="43">The daily rising and lying down ,</l>
       <l n="44">Waking and sleep ;</l>
       <l n="45">The daily care of the body 's needs ;</l>
       <l n="46">And daily desire to pass the gift of life ;</l>
       <l n="47">And daily fears of the morrow to come ;</l>
       <l n="48">And daily pains for things that are gone ;</l>
       <l n="49">And daily longing for things that fly us ;</l>
       <l n="50">And sorrow that follows wherever we go ;</l>
       <l n="51">And love that mocks us , and peace that breaks ,</l>
       <l n="52">And shame that tracks us , and want that gnaws .</l>
       <l n="53">But O ye Dead ! Ye great ones ,</l>
       <l n="54">Triumphant over these , released</l>
       <l n="55">From the duties of dust , all chains of desire ,</l>
       <l n="56">And made inhabitants of breathless spaces ,</l>
       <l n="57">Immanent in a realm of calm ,</l>
       <l n="58">Rulers of a sphere of tideless air ,</l>
       <l n="59">Victors returned from the war of death in life ,</l>
       <l n="60">Victors over death in death !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="61">For the growing soul turns in</l>
       <l n="62">Even as the seed turns in on itself ,</l>
       <l n="63">And becomes hard , transparent ,</l>
       <l n="64">An encased life , condensed</l>
       <l n="65">In the process of saving itself</l>
       <l n="66">From rains that beat in the fall ,</l>
       <l n="67">And frosts that descend from skies grown cold .</l>
       <l n="68">And we who shed away old thoughts and hopes ,</l>
       <l n="69">Days and dreams of life</l>
       <l n="70">Turn in , grow clear like grains of rice ,</l>
       <l n="71">Until the realm of death</l>
       <l n="72">Is as snow delivered land</l>
       <l n="73">Luring the seed —</l>
       <l n="74">And it becomes our home , our country ,</l>
       <l n="75">Our native land that calls us back</l>
       <l n="76">From this sojourn of adventure ,</l>
       <l n="77">And place of profit ;</l>
       <l n="78">For O ye majestic Dead , your absence draws us ,</l>
       <l n="79">If it be naught but absence still you summon ,</l>
       <l n="80">Your absence has become a very Presence ,</l>
       <l n="81">A Power , a hierarchy of Life !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="82">Even as leaves enrich the earth</l>

       <l n="84">Even as bodies of men enrich the soil</l>
       <l n="85">Generation on generation ,</l>

       <l n="2">It can n't be lost . I have a memory</l>
       <l n="3">I put it in a drawer , or again</l>
       <l n="4">I seem to see me tuck it in a pocket</l>
       <l n="5">Of some portmanteau . If you find the letter</l>
       <l n="6">Deliver it to Moore . But if it 's lost ,</l>
       <l n="7">The story is not lost . I tell you this</l>
       <l n="8">To save the story from my side . Attend !</l>
       <l n="9">It was this way :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">Allegra had become</l>
       <l n="11">A child requiring care , and nutritive</l>
       <l n="12">Instruction in religion , morals , well ,</l>
       <l n="13">They call me blasphemer and sensualist ,</l>
       <l n="14">But read my poems . Christianity</l>
       <l n="15">Was never of rejected things with me .</l>
       <l n="16">The Decalogue is good enough , I think .</l>
       <l n="17">And Shelley 's theories , atheist speculations</l>
       <l n="18">I never shared — nor social dreams . The scheme</l>
       <l n="19">Of having all things , women , too , in common</l>
       <l n="20">Means common women . I have sinned , I know —</l>
       <l n="21">I call it sin . The marriage vow I honor ,</l>
       <l n="22">And woman 's virtue . Though I stray , I hold</l>
       <l n="23">That women should be chaste , though man is not .</l>
       <l n="24">That 's why I placed Allegra in a convent ....</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="25">Now to the letter , and my story of it .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="26">The mother , Claire , Claire Claremont , as you know —</l>
       <l n="27">Pined for Allegra ; would possess the child</l>
       <l n="28">And take her from the convent — where ? No doubt</l>
       <l n="29">To Shelley 's nest , where William Godwin 's daughter</l>
       <l n="30">Raised on free love , and Shelley preaching it ,</l>
       <l n="31">And Claire in whom ‘ tis bred , hold sway , who read ,</l>
       <l n="32">Talk , argue , dream of freedom , all the things</l>
       <l n="33">Opposed to what is in the present order .</l>
       <l n="34">You know the notes to “ Queen Mab . ” Well , I say</l>
       <l n="35">This suits me not .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="36">So Shelley and his wife ,</l>
       <l n="37">Mary , the planet of an hour , since quenched ,</l>
       <l n="38">Conceive I keep Allegra where she is</l>
       <l n="39">From wounded pride , or pique . Hell fire ! They think</l>
       <l n="40">I 'm hurt for thinking Claire and Shelley join</l>
       <l n="41">Their lips in love , and masque my jealousy</l>
       <l n="42">By just this pose of morals , make reprisal</l>
       <l n="43">Under a lying flag , and keep Allegra</l>
       <l n="44">To punish Claire and sate my jealousy</l>
       <l n="45">By this hypocrisy — It makes me laugh .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="46">But to pursue . A maid who was discharged</l>
       <l n="47">From Shelley 's household told the credible tale</l>
       <l n="48">That Claire was Shelley 's mistress , and the Hoppners</l>
       <l n="49">Heard and believed — why not ? As she is fair ,</l>
       <l n="50">And Shelley wrote “ Love is like understanding</l>
       <l n="51">Which brighter grows gazing on many truths ,</l>
       <l n="52">Increases by division , ” that himself</l>
       <l n="53">Could not accept the code , a man should choose</l>
       <l n="54">One woman and leave all the rest , why not ?</l>
       <l n="55">As for myself , I have not preached this doctrine ,</l>
       <l n="56">Though living it as men do in the world ....</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="57">Oh yes , I know this love called spiritual ,</l>
       <l n="58">Of which old maids , whose milk has gone to brain</l>

       <l n="60">For taking men and women as they are ,</l>
       <l n="61">Talk to create belief for self and others .</l>

       <l n="69">That Claire and Shelley loved , you understand —</l>
       <l n="70">By the flesh . Sweet , was it not ? Naive !</l>
       <l n="71">This letter I should hand the Hoppners , who</l>
       <l n="72">Believed the story , and who held a place</l>
       <l n="73">Persuasive touching poor Allegra . Well ,</l>
       <l n="74">So Shelley comes and makes the point , the child</l>
       <l n="75">Is in ill health , Claire , too , in a decline ,</l>

       <l n="79">What principle makes me collaborator</l>
       <l n="80">With such fantastic business ? To resume :</l>
       <l n="81">He acted like the boy he was . I smiled —</l>
       <l n="82">Against the flaming rage that burned his face —</l>
       <l n="83">My mocking smile , he thought , the Don Juan</l>
       <l n="84">Upcurved my lips . I read his very thought</l>
       <l n="85">Between words spoken ; words that he suppressed :</l>
       <l n="86">It was that I was glad that Claire was ill</l>
       <l n="87">Because of that male mood when love of man</l>
       <l n="88">Finds sustenance where suffering lays low</l>
       <l n="89">The object of desire : If she suffers ,</l>
       <l n="90">The man subdues , devours her . She escapes</l>
       <l n="91">If free of love . Oh yes , and this he thought :</l>

       <l n="93">Had failed to hold her , failed to satisfy</l>
       <l n="94">Her noble heart ! God 's wounds ! Why Shelley thought</l>
       <l n="95">She turned to him and with his spirit found</l>
       <l n="96">A purity of peace and sweetest friendship ,</l>
       <l n="97">And faith that saves and serves , as men and women</l>
       <l n="98">Are to each other souls to serve and save !</l>
       <l n="99">Poor fool ! I read it all , or pieced it out</l>

       <l n="101">There was this further thing : I am a man ,</l>

       <l n="103">That woman 's love is lawless and a toy</l>
       <l n="104">When given if no priest has sanctified it —</l>

       <l n="12">Made by the folding mirrors . Look !</l>
       <l n="13">His thin legs wobble , bend and dangle</l>
       <l n="14">Like radish roots . He takes the crook</l>
       <l n="15">Out of his arms and raises them up ,</l>
       <l n="16">As if in panic , or supplication .</l>
       <l n="17">He bends and peers , whines like a pup ,</l>
       <l n="18">Walks to and fro in his desperation ,</l>

       <l n="25">Sees for the first the prodigal</l>
       <l n="26">Waste of stars in the black inane .</l>
       <l n="27">Stamps with his feet upon the void</l>
       <l n="28">He stands on , paces on , why , he wonders</l>

       <l n="43">The sacred fire with wings outspread and free ,</l>
       <l n="44">Wherein an Athens falls , a Sidon stands ,</l>

       <l n="51">The avid hunger of a fire so pure .</l>

       <l n="58">A slender reed that 's shaken by the wind .</l>
       <l n="59">Come cyclops of the counter , millionaires ,</l>
       <l n="60">Lawyers and statesmen in the world 's affairs ,</l>
       <l n="61">And thin away like flesh which acid eats</l>
       <l n="62">Under the passion even of John Keats .</l>
       <l n="63">But if you felt and saw love , agony ,</l>
       <l n="64">As Shakspeare knew them you would quickly die .</l>
       <l n="65">There is no tragedy like the gift of song ,</l>
       <l n="66">It keeps you mortal but demands you strong ;</l>
       <l n="67">It gives you God 's eyes blurred with human tears ,</l>
       <l n="68">And crowns a thousand lives in fifty years .</l>
       <l n="69">Enter the breathless silence where God dwells ,</l>

      <head>FOR A PLAY</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Love began with both of them so gently</l>
       <l n="2">Meeting , neither thought nor looked intently .</l>
       <l n="3">Afterward her breath invoked the fire —</l>
       <l n="4">Breath to breath set burning their desire .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Is there aught in flesh or is it spirit</l>
       <l n="6">Conscious of its kindred soul when near it ?</l>
       <l n="7">Woe to flesh or soul that 's wholly wakened</l>
       <l n="8">While the other 's soul-depths lie unshakened !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">How could she give him all sacred blisses ,</l>
       <l n="10">Long embraces , in the darkness kisses ,</l>
       <l n="11">If she was not his , all else forgetting ,</l>
       <l n="12">Lovers gone and other loves ’ regretting ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">That was just the place her gold was leadened —</l>
       <l n="14">Flesh there too alive , to him all deadened .</l>
       <l n="15">She could harp not to his playing wholly ,</l>
       <l n="16">Yet his heart strings trembled for her solely .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">So this love play hastened to the curtain .</l>
       <l n="18">Each one spoke his lines in accents certain ,</l>
       <l n="19">While at times behind the wings her glances</l>
       <l n="20">Warmed the prompter 's treasonous advances .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Is there greater martyrdom than this is ?</l>
       <l n="22">You have staked your soul where the abyss is .</l>
       <l n="23">You have given all — oh sorry barter</l>
       <l n="24">You have lit the fire for you the martyr .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">You will still love on , or turn to hating ,</l>
       <l n="26">Days depart , your heart stays in its waiting ,</l>
       <l n="27">Where 's the blame ? She gave her heart 's half measure ,</l>
       <l n="28">All she had , for all your soul 's full treasure .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">What 's the half to keep , could you achieve it ?</l>
       <l n="30">What your treasure if you could retrieve it ?</l>
       <l n="31">Never more shall you again bestow it ...</l>
       <l n="32">Now you have a song if you 're a poet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Now you 're ever dumb if song 's denied you ,</l>
       <l n="34">You shall be more dumb than all beside you ,</l>
       <l n="35">While your soul is shaken by its torrents —</l>
       <l n="36">Dante songless in a Dante Florence .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">Age shall not make strong , nor deeper learning .</l>
       <l n="38">Grief grows clearer with your eye 's discerning .</l>
       <l n="39">Pass the years , but oh the soil grows faster —</l>
       <l n="40">Richer for the roots of your disaster .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Ends the play — for what is life but dying ? What is love but fire forever crying ? What your soul but love 's pure carbon fuel ? Love and life make ashes of the jewel !</p>

       <l n="19">Was never caged , but from the first was bliss ,</l>

       <l n="102">Of change or faithlessness . Then with a swift</l>
       <l n="103">Arising from the prayer you disappear .</l>
       <l n="104">I sleep meanwhile , you come again and lift</l>

       <l n="111">Of your ecstatic coming — O my sweet !</l>
       <l n="112">I touched your silken gown , where underneath</l>

       <l n="115">Your golden ringlets loosened — and at last</l>

       <l n="117">For soon ‘ twixt love and sleep the night was past ,</l>
       <l n="118">And dawn cob-webbed the chamber . Then I heard</l>
       <l n="119">One faintest note and all was still — the vast</l>
       <l n="120">Spherule of heaven was pecked at by a bird</l>
       <l n="121">As it were to break the sky 's shell , let the light</l>

       <l n="124">We woke together , heard together , thrilled</l>

       <l n="183">Thus about your lawn</l>

       <l n="195">The madness of my life 's futility ,</l>

       <l n="10">So much</l>

       <l n="12">The father is a saint , a quietist ,</l>
       <l n="13">Save that he has his hatreds , strong enough :</l>
       <l n="14">Turns face of stone and silence to the men</l>
       <l n="15">Whose ways of life are laid in sin , he thinks</l>
       <l n="16">And calls them dirty dogs and scalawags ,</l>
       <l n="17">Because they vote a ticket he dislikes ,</l>
       <l n="18">Or love a game of cards , a glass of beer ,</l>

       <l n="61">Against a youth who speaks on Liberty .</l>
       <l n="62">And then he uses Gladstone for his theme ,</l>
       <l n="63">The Christian Statesman ; for exordium</l>

       <l n="65">It suffers soilure — that was Gladstone — yes !</l>
       <l n="66">But still he cannot win the prize ; a boy</l>
       <l n="67">Who talks about the labors of Charles Darwin ,</l>
       <l n="68">His suffering and sacrifice , is awarded</l>
       <l n="69">The prize this time — a boy who had the wit</l>
       <l n="70">To speak in praise of Darwin 's virtues — saying</l>
       <l n="71">Nothing about his hellish doctrines , thus</l>
       <l n="72">Winning the cautious judges to his theme .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="73">But is our little Gladstone crushed , dismayed ?</l>
       <l n="74">He plucks up further strength and takes a hint :</l>
       <l n="75">A larger subject may bring down the prize .</l>
       <l n="76">He thinks of Thomas Jefferson — but then</l>
       <l n="77">Jefferson was a deist , took the Bible</l>
       <l n="78">And cut out everything but Jesus ’ words .</l>

       <l n="82">Then something of this plan crept like a snake</l>
       <l n="83">Into his brain , he petted it with hands :</l>
       <l n="84">Be ye as wise as serpents , and as doves</l>
       <l n="85">Harmless , he smiled — and went to work again ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="87">And now he has stepped forth</l>
       <l n="88">Into the world 's arena to become</l>
       <l n="89">A Savior , an evangel , as he thinks ,</l>
       <l n="90">In truth a pest . He runs for Congress first</l>
       <l n="91">And when his manager takes out a check</l>
       <l n="92">And shows him , given by the local brewery ,</l>
       <l n="93">Another check a bank gives , he maintains</l>
       <l n="94">A smiling silence , thinking to himself ,</l>
       <l n="95">Jesus accepted gifts from publicans ,</l>
       <l n="96">And if I am elected then this money ,</l>

       <l n="99">But then he was defeated .</l>
       <l n="100">He thinks the banks and breweries did the trick .</l>
       <l n="101">In truth they knew the Christian Statesman , knew</l>
       <l n="102">The oleaginous smile and silver voice</l>
       <l n="103">Concealed the despot . Did he scourge them then ?</l>
       <l n="104">Well , scarcely then — he wrote a public letter</l>
       <l n="105">And said the people had decided it .</l>
       <l n="106">And what the people said was law . He nerved</l>
       <l n="107">His purpose for another trial — that body</l>
       <l n="108">So big and flawless could not be exhausted —</l>
       <l n="109">That voice still carried to the farthest corner ,</l>
       <l n="110">That oily smile deceived the multitude</l>
       <l n="111">That he was hurt , embittered , only waited</l>
       <l n="112">To see if body , voice and oily smile</l>
       <l n="113">Could win by any means ; if not , the scourge</l>
       <l n="114">Would be brought forth , the smile dropped , the complaints</l>
       <l n="115">Against the breweries , what not , opened up ,</l>
       <l n="116">Unmasked . For when your hope is gone , you 're free</l>
       <l n="117">To scold and tell your bitterness .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="118">And then</l>
       <l n="119">He made a third and last attempt , though edging</l>
       <l n="120">Toward the sophistry that moral questions</l>
       <l n="121">Make those political , and by this means</l>
       <l n="122">Trying to win the churches . Still he stuck</l>
       <l n="123">To matters economic , as before</l>
       <l n="124">Took what the breweries gave to help his cause ,</l>
       <l n="125">His campaign fund . By this time many more</l>
       <l n="126">Had found him out , and knew him for a voice</l>
       <l n="127">And tireless body nourishing a brain</l>
       <l n="128">As mediocre as the world contained ,</l>
       <l n="129">And only making louder noise because</l>
       <l n="130">Of body strong and voice mellifluous .</l>
       <l n="131">They put him down for good : the Christian Statesman</l>
       <l n="132">Had cause to think he was no statesman , or</l>
       <l n="133">No Christian , or the electorate not Christian .</l>
       <l n="134">And so he took the mask off , dropped the smile ,</l>
       <l n="135">And let his mouth set like a concrete crack</l>
       <l n="136">And went about to punish men , while seeming</l>
       <l n="137">To save the world .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="138">Out of that indentation ,</l>

       <l n="141">And smile toothed to the gullet — it was this :</l>
       <l n="142">Questions political are moral questions ,</l>

       <l n="146">To moral America , draw audiences</l>
       <l n="147">In churches , of the churches . If I win</l>
       <l n="148">Majorities upon — no matter what —</l>
       <l n="149">A law will blossom ; as all moral questions</l>
       <l n="150">Are equally political , procure</l>
       <l n="151">For their adoption the majority .</l>
       <l n="152">Upon this fortress I can stand and shoot —</l>
       <l n="153">Who can attack me , since I seek for self</l>
       <l n="154">Nothing , but for my country righteousness ?</l>
       <l n="155">And as an instrument of God I punish</l>
       <l n="156">My enemies as well .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="157">Who are my enemies ?</l>

       <l n="165">Really American !— I know the crowd —</l>

       <l n="174">The cocktail and the wine they love so well .</l>
       <l n="175">This is a moral question , being so</l>

      <head>AT SAGAMORE HILL</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">All things proceed as though the stage were set</l>
       <l n="2">For acts arranged . I have not learned the part ,</l>
       <l n="3">The day enacts itself . I take the tube ,</l>
       <l n="4">Find daylight at Jamaica , know the place</l>
       <l n="5">Through some rehearsal , all the country know</l>
       <l n="6">Which glides along the window , is not seen</l>
       <l n="7">For definite memory . At Oyster Bay</l>
       <l n="8">A taxi stands in readiness ; in a trice</l>
       <l n="9">We circle strips of water , slopes of hills ,</l>
       <l n="10">Climb where a granite wall supports a hill ,</l>
       <l n="11">A mass of blossoms , ripening berries , too ,</l>
       <l n="12">And enter at a gate , go up a drive ,</l>
       <l n="13">Shadowed by larches , cedars , silver willows .</l>
       <l n="14">This taxi just ahead is in the play ,</l>
       <l n="15">Is here in life as I had seen it in</l>
       <l n="16">The crystal of prevision , reaches first</l>
       <l n="17">The porte cochere . This moment from the door</l>
       <l n="18">Comes Roosevelt , and greets the man who leaves</l>
       <l n="19">The taxi just ahead , then waits for me ,</l>
       <l n="20">Puts a strong hand that softens into mine ,</l>
       <l n="21">And says , O , this is bully !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="22">We go in .</l>
       <l n="23">He leaves my antecessor in a room</l>
       <l n="24">Somewhere along the hall , and comes to me</l>
       <l n="25">Who wait him in the roomy library .</l>
       <l n="26">How are those lovely daughters ? Oh , by George !</l>
       <l n="27">I thought I might forget their names , I know —</l>
       <l n="28">It 's Madeline and Marcia . Yes , you know</l>
       <l n="29">Corinne adores the picture which you sent</l>
       <l n="30">Of Madeline — your boy , too ? In the war !</l>
       <l n="31">That 's bully — tea is coming — we must talk ,</l>
       <l n="32">I have five hundred things to ask you — set</l>
       <l n="33">The tea things on this table , Anna — now ,</l>
       <l n="34">Do you take sugar , lemon ? O , you smoke !</l>
       <l n="35">I 'll give you a cigar .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="36">The talk begins .</l>
       <l n="37">He 's dressed in canvas khaki , flannel shirt ,</l>
       <l n="38">Laced boots for farming , chopping trees , perhaps ;</l>
       <l n="39">A stocky frame , curtains of skin on cheeks</l>
       <l n="40">Drained slightly of their fat ; gash in the neck</l>
       <l n="41">Where pus was emptied lately ; one eye dim ,</l>
       <l n="42">And growing dimmer ; almost blind in that .</l>
       <l n="43">And when he walks he rolls a little like</l>
       <l n="44">A man whose youth is fading , like a cart</l>
       <l n="45">That rolls when springs are old . He is a moose ,</l>
       <l n="46">Scarred , battered from the hunters , thickets , stones ;</l>
       <l n="47">Some finest tips of antlers broken off ,</l>
       <l n="48">And eyes where images of ancient things</l>
       <l n="49">Flit back and forth across them , keeping still</l>
       <l n="50">A certain slumberous indifference</l>
       <l n="51">Or wisdom , it may be .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="52">But then the talk !</l>
       <l n="53">Bronze dolphins in a fountain cannot spout</l>
       <l n="54">More streams at once : Of course the war , the emperor ,</l>
       <l n="55">America in the war , his sons in France ,</l>
       <l n="56">The dangers , separation , let them go !</l>
       <l n="57">The fate has been appointed — to our task ,</l>
       <l n="58">Live full our lives with duty , go to sleep !</l>
       <l n="59">For I say , he exclaims , the man who fears</l>
       <l n="60">To die should not be born , nor left to live .</l>
       <l n="61">It 's Celtic poetry , free verse . He says :</l>
       <l n="62">You nobly celebrate in your Spoon River</l>
       <l n="63">The pioneers , the soldiers of the past ,</l>
       <l n="64">Why do you flout our Philippine adventure ?</l>
       <l n="65">No difference , Colonel , in the stock , the difference</l>
       <l n="66">Lies in the causes . Well , another stream :</l>
       <l n="67">Mark Hanna , Quay and others , what I hate ,</l>
       <l n="68">He says to me , is the Pharisee — I can stand</l>
       <l n="69">All other men . And you will find the men</l>
       <l n="70">So much maligned had gentle qualities ,</l>
       <l n="71">And noble dreams . Poor Quay , he loved the Indians ,</l>
       <l n="72">Sent for me when he lay there dying , said ,</l>
       <l n="73">Look after such a tribe when I am dead .</l>
       <l n="74">I want to crawl upon a sunny rock</l>
       <l n="75">And die there like a wolf . Did he say that ,</l>
       <l n="76">Colonel , to you ? Yes ! and you know , a man</l>
       <l n="77">Who says a thing like that has in his soul</l>
       <l n="78">An orb of light to flash that meaning forth</l>
       <l n="79">Of heroism , nature .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="80">Time goes on ,</l>
       <l n="81">The play is staged , must end ; my taxi comes</l>
       <l n="82">In half an hour or so . Before it comes ,</l>
       <l n="83">Let 's walk about the farm and see my corn .</l>
       <l n="84">A fellow on the porch is warming heels</l>
       <l n="85">As we go by . I 'll see him when you go ,</l>
       <l n="86">The Colonel says .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="87">The rail fence by the corn</l>
       <l n="88">Is good to lean on as we stand and talk</l>
       <l n="89">Of farming , cattle , country life . We turn ,</l>
       <l n="90">Sit for some moments in a garden house</l>
       <l n="91">On which a rose vine clambers all in bloom ,</l>
       <l n="92">And from this hilly place look at the strips</l>
       <l n="93">Of water from the bay a mile beyond ,</l>
       <l n="94">Below some several terraces of hills</l>
       <l n="95">Where firs and pines are growing . This resembles</l>
       <l n="96">A scene in Milton that I 've read . He knows ,</l>
       <l n="97">Catches the reminiscence , quotes the lines — and then</l>
       <l n="98">Something of country silence , look of grass</l>
       <l n="99">Where the wind stirs it , mystical little breaths</l>
       <l n="100">Coming between the roses ; something , too ,</l>
       <l n="101">In Vulcan 's figure ; he is Vulcan , too ,</l>
       <l n="102">Deprived his shop , great bellows , hammer , anvil ,</l>
       <l n="103">Sitting so quietly beside me , hands</l>
       <l n="104">Spread over knees ; something of these evokes</l>
       <l n="105">A pathos , and immediately in key</l>
       <l n="106">With all of this he says : I have achieved</l>
       <l n="107">By labor , concentration , not at all</l>
       <l n="108">By gifts or genius , being commonplace</l>
       <l n="109">In all my faculties .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="110">Not all , I say .</l>

       <l n="114">Your case against you , timid born , you say ,</l>
       <l n="115">Becoming brave , asthmatic , growing strong :</l>
       <l n="116">No marksman , yet becoming skilled with guns ;</l>
       <l n="117">No gift of speech , yet winning golden speech ;</l>
       <l n="118">No gift of writing , writing books , no less</l>

        <l n="212">Spoke to her , slapped her hands and shook her ,</l>
        <l n="213">Asked her who it was that forsook her ,</l>

        <l n="223">Feathery clear in the crystal flood ;</l>
        <l n="224">He gave me honey and grapes for food .</l>
        <l n="225">We rode on the clouds and counted the stars .</l>
        <l n="226">He sang me songs of the ancient wars .</l>

       <l n="15">It was this way : I fell in love that spring</l>

       <l n="19">And Lillie thought of me , and so we flunked .</l>
       <l n="20">That thinned the class to Burney Cole , and he</l>

       <l n="25">Lil and I</l>
       <l n="26">Sat there and laughed — the town was in the hall ,</l>

       <l n="28">And when they handed Burney his diploma</l>
       <l n="29">The crowd went wild .</l>
       <l n="30">How does this razor work ?</l>
       <l n="31">Not shaving you too close ? I try to please ...</l>
       <l n="32">Burney was famous for a night , you see .</l>
       <l n="33">They thought his piece was wonderful , such command</l>

       <l n="35">Next morning with his ears and cheeks still burning ,</l>
       <l n="36">Flushed like a god , as Keats says , Burney stood</l>
       <l n="37">Behind the counter in the grocery store</l>
       <l n="38">Beginning then to earn the means to take</l>
       <l n="39">A course in Science — when a customer</l>
       <l n="40">Came in and said : a piece of star tobacco ,</l>
       <l n="41">Young fellow , hurry ! Such is fame — one night</l>
       <l n="42">You 're on a platform gathering in bouquets ,</l>

       <l n="59">And penitent , we had a great revival .</l>
       <l n="60">And just to use the lingo : after much</l>
       <l n="61">Wrestling at the Seat of Mercy , prayers</l>
       <l n="62">And ministrations then I saw the light ,</l>
       <l n="63">Became converted , got the ecstasy .</l>
       <l n="64">I wrote to Lillie who was in Chicago</l>
       <l n="65">To seek salvation , told her of myself .</l>
       <l n="66">She wrote back , you are cracked — go take a pill ....</l>
       <l n="67">I know you 've come to get your hair trimmed , shaved ,</l>
       <l n="68">Also to hear my story — you shall hear .</l>
       <l n="69">The elders saw in me a likely man</l>
       <l n="70">And said there is a preacher . First I knew</l>
       <l n="71">They had a purse made up to send me off</l>
       <l n="72">To learn theology , and so I went .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="73">I plunged into the stuff that preachers learn :</l>
       <l n="74">The Hebrew language , Aramaic and Syriac ;</l>
       <l n="75">The Hebrew ideas — rapid survey — oh , yes ,</l>
       <l n="76">Rapid survey , that was the usual thing .</l>
       <l n="77">Histories of Syria and Palestine ;</l>
       <l n="78">Theology of the Synoptics , eschatology .</l>
       <l n="79">Doctrine of the Trinity , Docetism ,</l>
       <l n="80">And Christian writings to Eusebius .</l>
       <l n="81">Well , in the midst of all of this what happens ?</l>
       <l n="82">A fellow shows me Draper and this stuff</l>
       <l n="83">Went up like shale and soft rock in a blast .</l>
       <l n="84">My room mate was John Smith , he handed me</l>
       <l n="85">This book of Draper 's . What do you suppose ?</l>
       <l n="86">This scamp was there to get at secret things ,</l>
       <l n="87">Was laughing in his sleeve , had no belief .</l>
       <l n="88">He used to say : “ They 'd never know me now . ”</l>
       <l n="89">By which he meant he was a different person</l>
       <l n="90">In some round dozen places , and each place</l>
       <l n="91">Was different from the others , he was native</l>
       <l n="92">To each place , played his part there , was unknown</l>
       <l n="93">As fitted to another , hence his words</l>
       <l n="94">“ They 'd never know me now . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="95">And so it was</l>
       <l n="96">This John Smith acted through the course , came through</l>
       <l n="97">A finished preacher . But they found me out</l>
       <l n="98">As soon as Draper gnawed my faith in two .</l>
       <l n="99">The good folks back in Sepo took away</l>
       <l n="100">The purse they lent and left me high and dry .</l>
       <l n="101">So I came back and learned the barber 's trade ,</l>
       <l n="102">And here I am . But when I save enough</l>
       <l n="103">I mean to start a little magazine</l>
       <l n="104">To show what is the matter . Do you know ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="105">It 's something on the shelf — not booze or jam :</l>
       <l n="106">It 's that old bible , precious family bible ,</l>
       <l n="107">That record of the Hebrew thought and life —</l>
       <l n="108">That book that takes a course of years to study ,</l>
       <l n="109">Requires Aramaic , Hebrew , Greek and Coptic</l>
       <l n="110">And epigraphy , metaphysics , not</l>
       <l n="111">Because the book itself is rich in these</l>

       <l n="117">After this manner , you will travel far</l>
       <l n="118">In every land and realm . But this is nothing .</l>
       <l n="119">The preachers are a handful to the world .</l>
       <l n="120">They eat this dead stuff like bacteria</l>
       <l n="121">That clean away decay . The harm is here</l>

       <l n="132">You have created , kept intact a body ,</l>
       <l n="133">An audience and voting strength — for whom ,</l>
       <l n="134">The reformer , the fanatic , non-conformist ,</l>

       <l n="11">My first step in this world was as a soldier ,</l>

       <l n="56">I see at last</l>
       <l n="57">I am not one but many minds at once ,</l>
       <l n="58">And many personalities . As a boy</l>
       <l n="59">I took the color of the leaves or wall</l>
       <l n="60">Where I was resting , climbing . If in truth</l>
       <l n="61">I lived three months with an uncle , then they said</l>
       <l n="62">You look just like your uncle . When I worked</l>
       <l n="63">Under a lawyer 's tutelage , they said :</l>
       <l n="64">How much your face resembles his . I knew</l>
       <l n="65">My face and voice and gestures simulated</l>
       <l n="66">Those I admired or lived with . But besides</l>
       <l n="67">I took a certain pleasure , impish , maybe ,</l>
       <l n="68">In egging on , agreeing with , the souls</l>
       <l n="69">Whom I sought out ; I used to tell my uncle ,</l>
       <l n="70">A man of firmest piety , what I heard</l>
       <l n="71">Of blasphemy about the village , just</l>
       <l n="72">To hear him deprecate it , look with dark</l>
       <l n="73">And flashing eyes upon such sin , while I ,</l>
       <l n="74">With serious face and earnest sympathy</l>
       <l n="75">With what he felt , was laughing in my sleeve .</l>
       <l n="76">Here is the germ then of my after life :</l>
       <l n="77">The faculty that harmonized my hue</l>
       <l n="78">Of spirit with the place , the person , while</l>
       <l n="79">Something in me , perhaps supremest self ,</l>
       <l n="80">Stood quite aloof and smiled .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="81">But , as I said ,</l>
       <l n="82">When our Republic left its hill of vision ,</l>
       <l n="83">Descended to the place of herding hogs ,</l>
       <l n="84">This self of me , the adventurer , rose up</l>
       <l n="85">And led me forth to play with life , and first</l>
       <l n="86">To try theology , as I have said ...</l>
       <l n="87">I was a wonder bred among the crew</l>
       <l n="88">Of quiet , gate-toothed , crook-nosed psychopaths ,</l>
       <l n="89">The foul-breathed , thick-lipped onanists who filled</l>
       <l n="90">The seminary , stared at me to see</l>
       <l n="91">How I learned Sanscrit , could defend and rout</l>
       <l n="92">The atheistic speculations . Well ,</l>
       <l n="93">What I enjoyed most was to get a crowd</l>
       <l n="94">Of celibates and talk of chastity ,</l>
       <l n="95">And get them in a glow , and say to them :</l>
       <l n="96">The mind is fortified by abstinence ,</l>
       <l n="97">The spirit clarified and lifted up —</l>
       <l n="98">I got a thrill somehow . But all the time</l>
       <l n="99">I knew a girl named Ella . Oftentimes</l>
       <l n="100">Lying beside her I would shriek with laughter</l>
       <l n="101">And she would ask , what is the matter , John ?</l>
       <l n="102">And I would say : I 'm thinking of a song</l>
       <l n="103">I heard one time : “ They 'd never know me now . ”</l>
       <l n="104">And Ella said : If Dr. Simpson knew</l>
       <l n="105">That you were here with me , you 'd take a fall</l>
       <l n="106">Out of the Seminary 's second floor ....</l>

       <l n="107">But I went through and did n't fall . And thought</l>
       <l n="108">This is a way to live , I 'll preach awhile ,</l>
       <l n="109">And see what comes . I took a church and preached ,</l>
       <l n="110">Was known as Smith the eloquent , the earnest .</l>
       <l n="111">But all the time I heard a voice that said :</l>
       <l n="112">“ They 'd never know me now . ” When I came in</l>
       <l n="113">The Sunday School and little children flocked</l>
       <l n="114">About my knees and patient teachers looked</l>
       <l n="115">With white , pure faces at me , then that voice</l>
       <l n="116">“ They 'd never know me now ” was in my ear ....</l>

       <l n="117">Well , to go on , a widow in my church</l>
       <l n="118">Young , beautiful and rich began to beat</l>
       <l n="119">Her wings around my flame , and on the Sunday</l>
       <l n="120">I preached about the rich young man , she came ,</l>
       <l n="121">Invited me to dinner . We commenced ,</l>
       <l n="122">Were married in six months . And to conserve</l>
       <l n="123">Her properties I studied law , at last</l>
       <l n="124">Was spending days with brokers , business men ,</l>
       <l n="125">Began to tell her that my health was failing ,</l>
       <l n="126">Saw doctors frequently to play the part .</l>
       <l n="127">And then she said : You must resign your charge ,</l>
       <l n="128">Your health is breaking , dear . And I resigned</l>
       <l n="129">To spend the time in checking mortgages ,</l>
       <l n="130">Collecting rents :— “ They 'd never know me now ” ...</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="131">We went the round of summer places , travel ,</l>
       <l n="132">Saw Europe , China , India and the Isles .</l>
       <l n="133">Near Florence had a villa for a time ,</l>
       <l n="134">Met people of all kinds , when I was forty</l>
       <l n="135">I had a thousand selves , but if I had</l>
       <l n="136">A self in truth it was submerged or scrawled</l>
       <l n="137">Like a palimpsest all over and so lost .</l>
       <l n="138">I did n't know myself , was anything</l>
       <l n="139">To every one , and everything to all .</l>
       <l n="140">I felt the walking age come on me now :</l>
       <l n="141">A polar bear in a terrible rhythm swings</l>
       <l n="142">His body back and forth behind the bars ,</l>
       <l n="143">And I would walk in restlessness or think</l>
       <l n="144">Of other skies and places , teased and stung</l>
       <l n="145">By memories of my other selves , by wonder</l>
       <l n="146">About what may be happening here or there ;</l>
       <l n="147">What are they doing now ? What is she doing ?</l>
       <l n="148">There were a dozen shes to wonder about ,</l>
       <l n="149">And if you think of one you wish to see ,</l>
       <l n="150">And dream she knows delight apart from you ,</l>
       <l n="151">You simply thrill , the wings you lost revolve ,</l>
       <l n="152">Like thumbs , vestigial stubs — but there you sit .</l>
       <l n="153">Thank God the aeroplane came on to help ,</l>
       <l n="154">And wipe out distance , for you find at last</l>
       <l n="155">Distance is tragedy , terrifies the soul</l>
       <l n="156">With space which must be mastered by the soul .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="157">And so I bought a hydroplane . Perhaps</l>
       <l n="158">Would be upon my lawn at sun-down holding</l>
       <l n="159">These children on my knees , a lovely picture !</l>
       <l n="160">Then as a fish darts out of darkened water</l>
       <l n="161">Into a water sun-lit , there would come</l>
       <l n="162">A thought — we 'll say of Alice — in two hours</l>
       <l n="163">I 'd be upon her little sleeping porch</l>
       <l n="164">Two hundred miles away , beneath the stars</l>
       <l n="165">Of middle summer , having killed that space ,</l>
       <l n="166">And found the hour I wanted — hearing too</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="168">And I remember when we were in Florence</l>
       <l n="169">My tribe had gone to Milan for some weeks ,</l>
       <l n="170">And I was quite alone , too bored to live .</l>
       <l n="171">One listless afternoon who should come in ?</l>
       <l n="172">My wife 's friend Constance — but to tell the truth</l>
       <l n="173">More friend of mine than hers , for all my life</l>
       <l n="174">I seemed to have these secret understandings ,</l>
       <l n="175">And was two persons to a twain who thought</l>
       <l n="176">They were the bond , whereas the bond existed</l>
       <l n="177">Between myself and one , and to the other</l>
       <l n="178">Was not so much as dreamed .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="179">And Constance brought</l>
       <l n="180">A certain Countess with her . In a glance</l>
       <l n="181">We two , the Countess and myself , beheld</l>
       <l n="182">A flame that joined our hands . And in a week</l>
       <l n="183">The Countess took me on her yacht to Capri ,</l>
       <l n="184">And round the Mediterranean . No one knew ,</l>
       <l n="185">Not Constance , nor my wife , for I returned</l>
       <l n="186">Before she came from Milan .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="187">Oh that week !</l>
       <l n="188">That breeze that sung the port-holes , waters blue</l>
       <l n="189">And stars at night and music ; and the Countess</l>
       <l n="190">Whose voice was like a lute of gold , who lived ,</l>
       <l n="191">Knew life , was unafraid . She heard me say</l>
       <l n="192">“ They 'd never know me now . ” And softly murmured</l>
       <l n="193">Smiling the while : il lupo cangia</l>
       <l n="194">Il pelo ma non il vizio</l>
       <l n="195">Adding , Qual matto ! Something yet remains</l>
       <l n="196">That makes you charming ! Oh the feasts and wine ,</l>
       <l n="197">The songs and poems , till at last too soon</l>
       <l n="198">We anchored in the bay of Naples . When</l>
       <l n="199">I saw Vesuvius , then I felt again</l>
       <l n="200">That sinking of the heart that I had known ,</l>
       <l n="201">That sickness , strange , nostalgia , from a boy ,</l>
       <l n="202">Of which a word again . But now it was</l>
       <l n="203">Precursive of the end , the finished idyll .</l>
       <l n="204">The Countess took my hand , with misty eyes —</l>
       <l n="205">They let me off and rowed me to the dock ,</l>
       <l n="206">I caught the train to Florence , magically</l>
       <l n="207">Before I had forgotten , seemed to be</l>
       <l n="208">Upon the yacht still , was in truth alone</l>
       <l n="209">Amid the silence of my dining room ,</l>
       <l n="210">Supping alone — “ They 'd never know me now ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="211">Later I had the fever , was delirious</l>
       <l n="212">And saw myself receding as if backing</l>
       <l n="213">Into a funnel toward the little end ,</l>
       <l n="214">And growing smaller as the funnel narrowed</l>
       <l n="215">Until I was so small I held myself</l>
       <l n="216">Within the palm 's hand of my other self ,</l>
       <l n="217">Laughed like a devil , scared the nurse to death ,</l>
       <l n="218">Saying “ They 'd never know me now — just look ! ”</l>
       <l n="219">My wife too had the fever . I awoke</l>
       <l n="220">Out of this illness , found that she was gone ,</l>
       <l n="221">Had died a week before and for a week</l>
       <l n="222">Had been entombed while I was raving — then</l>
       <l n="223">If any real self of me ever was it came</l>
       <l n="224">Back to me then . I bowed my head and wept</l>
       <l n="225">And scanned my life back :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="226">What was that in me</l>
       <l n="227">Which made me homesick from a boy right through</l>
       <l n="228">This life of mine , not for my home , for something ,</l>
       <l n="229">Some place , some hand , some scene , which made me dread</l>
       <l n="230">All partings , overwhelmed me with a grief</l>
       <l n="231">For ended raptures , kept my brain too full</l>
       <l n="232">Of memories , never lost , that grew until</l>
       <l n="233">I lost myself , and seemed a thousand selves</l>
       <l n="234">Wandering through a thousand years , how restless !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="235">Then mutterings shook our skies ! Another war ,</l>
       <l n="236">France , Germany and England , so it seemed</l>
       <l n="237">Best to return here to America .</l>
       <l n="238">I gathered up the children — all but one ,</l>
       <l n="239">The boy eighteen escaped me , ran away</l>
       <l n="240">And joined the English army . Now I saw</l>

       <l n="242">To free the Cubans ! Curse these freedom wars !</l>
       <l n="243">They shipped him off to India , soon he had</l>
       <l n="244">His fill of liberty . But I came back</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="246">For what is left of me , what ever was</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="261">So I was in America again ,</l>
       <l n="262">Had fled the war and plunged into the war :—</l>
       <l n="263">The waves roared yonder , but the shores were here</l>
       <l n="264">Where wreckage , putrid monsters were thrown up ,</l>
       <l n="265">Corpses of ancient liberties and bones</l>
       <l n="266">Of treasured beauty ; and I saw the Land</l>

       <l n="268">When I fought for the Cubans , even worse .</l>
       <l n="269">They shipped my boy to Africa ; in spite</l>
       <l n="270">Of censorship I pieced the picture out ,</l>
       <l n="271">Knew what he suffered , how they took his faith</l>
       <l n="272">And dimmed its flame with ordure . Then came forth</l>
       <l n="273">That father self of me . I brooded on</l>
       <l n="274">His blue eyes , gentle ways , sat terrified</l>
       <l n="275">And tried to trace the days through and the years</l>
       <l n="276">When he had slipped from just a little boy</l>
       <l n="277">Into a stripling , soldier finally —</l>
       <l n="278">While I — what was I doing ? Oh , my God ,</l>
       <l n="279">Living these other selves , oblivious</l>
       <l n="280">That this boy was . I 'd jump from soundest sleep</l>
       <l n="281">Thinking of him in Africa , and seized</l>
       <l n="282">With dreams that I must fly to him . O years</l>
       <l n="283">Wherein I lost that boy . How could I live</l>
       <l n="284">So many lives and not lose out of some ,</l>
       <l n="285">Some precious thing ? Well , then I broke at last ,</l>

       <l n="2">James Frothingham , a reverend , have the church</l>

       <l n="4">As I was passing by a vile saloon</l>
       <l n="5">Some men were entering the back room , saying</l>
       <l n="6">Is he dead or drunk , and such things . I looked in ,</l>
       <l n="7">Went in at last and saw this fellow there ,</l>

       <l n="153">And the cities reek with hypocrites , who step</l>
       <l n="154">On Freedom and on Beauty , are rewarded ,</l>
       <l n="155">Praised , fed and honored for it . Then behold</l>
       <l n="156">Your friend who loves you , hunted , buffeted ,</l>
       <l n="157">For a little drink , when in spite of drink and even</l>
       <l n="158">Because of drink , who knows ? I have achieved ,</l>
       <l n="159">Written these books . And what is life beside ,</l>
       <l n="160">Whether with drink or whether with abstinence ,</l>
       <l n="161">Except to sing your song and die , what course</l>
       <l n="162">Can stave the event , the wage of life , not sin ?</l>
       <l n="163">Oh if you knew what love I have for you !</l>
       <l n="164">All of my powers are not enough to tell</l>

       <l n="166">Eternal things through you , cannot surrender</l>
       <l n="167">Your love , your heart , without I lose some life ,</l>
       <l n="168">Some vital part of me — and yet farewell ,</l>
       <l n="169">For you have willed it so , and I submit .</l>
       <l n="170">I rise up in my loneliness , seek the sun</l>
       <l n="171">To shine about me in my loneliness ,</l>
       <l n="172">Submit and say farewell . ”</l>
