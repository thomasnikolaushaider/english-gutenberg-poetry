     <l n="1">Tender flowers , light as the sea 's foam ,</l>
     <l n="2">Graced our garden way ;</l>
     <l n="3">The lapsing wind would give your hands caress</l>
     <l n="4">And with your hair would play .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The shade was kind to our united steps</l>
     <l n="6">That wandered soberly ;</l>
     <l n="7">And from the village a child 's song arose</l>
     <l n="8">To fill infinity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Our ponds extended in the autumn light</l>
     <l n="10">Beneath the guarding reed ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the wood 's forehead showed its mobile crown</l>
     <l n="12">To pools upon the mead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">And we , who knew our hearts were murmuring</l>
     <l n="14">In union but one prayer ,</l>
     <l n="15">Thought that it was our peaceful life the eve</l>
     <l n="16">Showed unveiled there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Supremely then you saw the sky aglow</l>
     <l n="18">For a farewell caress ;</l>
     <l n="19">And long and long you looked on it with eyes</l>
     <l n="20">Filled with mute tenderness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>II</head>

      <l n="21">If it be true</l>
      <l n="22">That garden flower or meadow tree</l>
      <l n="23">May hold still any memory</l>
      <l n="24">Of lovers past who once looked on</l>
      <l n="25">Their splendour or their purity ,</l>
      <l n="26">So shall our love return once more</l>
      <l n="27">In that long hour of long regret</l>
      <l n="28">To give the rose , or in the oak restore ,</l>
      <l n="29">Its sweetness or its strength ,</l>
      <l n="30">Ere death come yet .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="31">Thus shall it survive unconquered</l>
      <l n="32">Within the glory that belongs to simple things ,</l>
      <l n="33">And find a joy again , in light that cleaves</l>
      <l n="34">The sky on summer break of day ,</l>
      <l n="35">And find a joy again</l>
      <l n="36">In the sweet rain</l>
      <l n="37">That dwells in drops on hanging leaves .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="38">And if on some fair eve , from depths of space ,</l>
      <l n="39">Should come two lovers hand in hand ,</l>
      <l n="40">The oak , like a large and puissant wing</l>
      <l n="41">Would reach its shadow out to where they stand ,</l>
      <l n="42">And the rose would give them of its perfumed grace .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="43">Dead is the glycin and the hawthorne flower ;</l>
      <l n="44">But now is the time when heather-bloom is seen ,</l>
      <l n="45">And on this so calm eve the rustling wind</l>
      <l n="46">Brings you the fragrance of the starved Campine .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="47">Love and breathe them , thinking of its fate ;</l>
      <l n="48">Over that rugged soil the storm-wind lives ;</l>
      <l n="49">Sand and sea have made of it their prey ,</l>
      <l n="50">Yet of the little left , it ever gives .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="51">Of old , though autumn came , we dwelled with it ,</l>
      <l n="52">With plain and forest , with the storm and light ,</l>
      <l n="53">Until the angels of the Christmas time</l>
      <l n="54">Inscribed its legend with their winged flight .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="55">Your heart became more simple and more sure ;</l>
      <l n="56">We loved the villagers and the forlorn</l>
      <l n="57">Old women who would speak of their great age</l>
      <l n="58">And of old spinning-wheels their hands had worn .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="59">Our quiet house upon the misty heath</l>
      <l n="60">Was frank and welcoming to all who came ;</l>
      <l n="61">Its roof was dear to us , its door and sill ,</l>
      <l n="62">And hearth long blackened by familiar flame .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="63">When over vast , pale , measureless repose</l>
      <l n="64">The total splendour of the night was set ,</l>
      <l n="65">A lesson of deep silence we received ,</l>
      <l n="66">Whose ardour never shall our souls forget .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="67">Since we were more alone amid the plain ,</l>
      <l n="68">The dawn and evening entered more our thought ,</l>
      <l n="69">Our eyes were franker and our hearts more sweet</l>
      <l n="70">And with the world 's desire more fully fraught .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="71">We found content in not exacting it ;</l>
      <l n="72">The sadness , even , of the days was kind ,</l>
      <l n="73">And the rare sunlight of the autumn 's end</l>
      <l n="74">Charmed us the more that it seemed weak and blind .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="75">Dead is the glycin and the hawthorne flower ;</l>
      <l n="76">But now are the days when heather-bloom is seen ,</l>
      <l n="77">Remember these , and let the rustling wind</l>
      <l n="78">Bring you the fragrance of the starved Campine .</l>

      <l n="82">Shine</l>
      <l n="83">The ancient flame ;</l>
      <l n="84">And look upon the fire</l>
      <l n="85">Quietly , with your eyes</l>
      <l n="86">That have no fear of any light ,</l>
      <l n="87">So that for me they be the same ,</l>
      <l n="88">Yet franker when the blaze leaps higher</l>
      <l n="89">Making them as from deep within you , bright .</l>

      <l n="94">Which we will not to restrain ,</l>
      <l n="95">Leads the kiss , marvellous and sure ,</l>
      <l n="96">From hand to brow , from brow to lips again .</l>

      <l n="100">All is more dear to me , your lips , your arms close-pressed ,</l>
      <l n="101">And your kind bosom whereon my tired head</l>
      <l n="102">After the rapture you bestow , sinks down</l>
      <l n="103">Quietly , near your heart to find its rest .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="104">I love you still more after love 's sharp pain</l>
      <l n="105">When your goodness still more sure and motherly</l>
      <l n="106">Brings repose to passion 's ardency ,</l>
      <l n="107">And , when desire has cried aloud its will ,</l>
      <l n="108">I hear approach familiar joy again ,</l>
