    <head>I</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I marked the slow withdrawal of the year ,</l>
     <l n="2">Out on the hills the scarlet maples shone —</l>
     <l n="3">The glad , first herald of triumphant dawn .</l>
     <l n="4">A robin 's song fell through the silence — clear</l>
     <l n="5">As long ago it rang when June was here .</l>
     <l n="6">Then , suddenly , a few grey clouds were drawn</l>
     <l n="7">Across the sky ; and all the song was gone ,</l>
     <l n="8">And all the gold was quick to disappear ,</l>
     <l n="9">That day the sun seemed loth to come again ;</l>
     <l n="10">And all day long the low wind spoke of rain ,</l>
     <l n="11">Far off , beyond the hills ; and moaned , like one</l>
     <l n="12">Wounded , among the pines : as though the Earth ,</l>
     <l n="13">Knowing some giant grief had come to birth ,</l>
     <l n="14">Had wearied of the Summer and the Sun .</l>

     <head>II</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="15">I watched the slow oncoming of the Fall .</l>
      <l n="16">Slowly the leaves fell from the elms , and lay</l>
      <l n="17">Along the roadside ; and the wind 's strange way</l>
      <l n="18">Was their way , when they heard the wind 's far call .</l>
      <l n="19">The crimson vines that clung along the wall</l>
      <l n="20">Grew thin as snow that lives on into May ;</l>
      <l n="21">Grey dawn , grey noon ,— all things and hours were grey ,</l>
      <l n="22">When quietly the darkness covered all .</l>
      <l n="23">And while no sunset flamed across the west ,</l>
      <l n="24">And no great moon rose where the hills were low ,</l>
      <l n="25">The day passed out as if it had not been :</l>
      <l n="26">And so it seemed the year sank to its rest ,</l>
      <l n="27">Remembering naught , desiring naught ,— as though</l>
      <l n="28">Early in Spring its young leaves were not green .</l>

     <head>III</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="29">A little while before the Fall was done</l>
      <l n="30">A day came when the frail year paused and said :</l>
      <l n="31">“ Behold ! a little while and I am dead ;</l>
      <l n="32">Wilt thou not choose , of all the old dreams , one ? ”</l>
      <l n="33">Then dwelt I in a garden , where the sun</l>
      <l n="34">Shone always , and the roses all were red ;</l>
      <l n="35">Far off , the great sea slept , and overhead ,</l>
      <l n="36">Among the robins , matins had begun .</l>
      <l n="37">And I knew not at all it was a dream</l>
      <l n="38">Only , and that the year was near its close ;</l>
      <l n="39">Garden and sunshine , robin-song and rose ,</l>
      <l n="40">The half-heard murmur and the distant gleam</l>
      <l n="41">Of all the unvext sea , a little space</l>
      <l n="42">Were as a mist above the Autumn 's face .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="43">And in this garden sloping to the sea</l>
      <l n="44">I dwelt ( it seemed ) to watch a pageant pass ,—</l>
      <l n="45">Great Kings , their armour strong with iron and brass ,</l>
      <l n="46">Young Queens , with yellow hair bound wonderfully .</l>
      <l n="47">For love 's sake , and because of love 's decree ,</l>
      <l n="48">Most went , I knew ; and so the flowers and grass</l>
      <l n="49">Knew my steps also : yet I wept Alas ,</l>
      <l n="50">Deeming the garden surely lost to me .</l>
      <l n="51">But as the days went over , and still our feet</l>
      <l n="52">Trod the warm , even places , I knew well</l>
      <l n="53">( For I , as they , followed the close-heard beat</l>
      <l n="54">Of Love 's wide wings who was her sentinel )</l>
      <l n="55">That here had Beauty built her citadel</l>
      <l n="56">And only we should reach her mercy-seat .</l>

      <l n="58">Thy raiment , Glauce , shall be my attire !</l>
      <l n="59">East of the Sun I , too , seek my desire !</l>
      <l n="60">My kisses , also , quicken the well-wrought clay !</l>
      <l n="61">And thou , Alcestis , lest my little day</l>
      <l n="62">Be done , art glad to die ! Upon my pyre ,</l>
      <l n="63">O Brynhild , let thine ashes feed the fire !</l>
      <l n="64">And , O thou Wood Sun , pray for me , I pray !</l>
      <l n="65">Yea , ye are mine ! Yet there remaineth one</l>
      <l n="66">Who maketh Summer-time of all the year ,</l>
      <l n="67">Whose glory darkeneth the very sun .</l>
      <l n="68">For thee my sword was sharpened and my spear ,</l>
      <l n="69">For thee my least poor deed was dreamed and done ,</l>

      <l n="71">Then , suddenly , I was awake . Dead things</l>
      <l n="72">Were all about me and the year was dead .</l>
      <l n="73">Save where the birches grew , all leaves were shed</l>
      <l n="74">And nowhere fell the sound of song or wings .</l>
      <l n="75">The fields I deemed were graves of worshipped Kings</l>

      <l n="80">This time of year shall hold some unknown grace</l>
      <l n="81">When the leaves fall , and shall be sanctified :</l>
      <l n="82">As April only comes for memory</l>
      <l n="83">Of him who kissed the veil from Beauty 's face</l>
