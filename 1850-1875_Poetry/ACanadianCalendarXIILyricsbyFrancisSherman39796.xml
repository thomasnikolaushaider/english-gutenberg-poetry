     <head>I . IN THE NORTH .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">Come , let us go and be glad again together</l>
      <l n="2">Where of old our eyes were opened and we knew that we were free !</l>
      <l n="3">Come , for it is April , and her hands have loosed the tether</l>
      <l n="4">That has bound for long her children .— who her children more</l>
      <l n="5">than we ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="6">Hark ! hear you not how the strong waters thunder</l>
      <l n="7">Down through the alders with the word they have to bring ?</l>
      <l n="8">Even now they win the meadow and the withered turf is under ,</l>
      <l n="9">And , above , the willows quiver with foreknowledge of the spring .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="10">Yea , they come , and joy in coming : for the giant hills have sent</l>
      <l n="11">them .—</l>
      <l n="12">The hills that guard the portal where the South has built her</l>
      <l n="13">throne :</l>
      <l n="14">Unloitering their course is ,— can wayside pools content them ,</l>
      <l n="15">Who were born where old pine forests for the sea forever moan ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="16">And they , behind the hills , where forever bloom the flowers ,</l>
      <l n="17">So they ever know the worship of the re-arisen Earth ?</l>
      <l n="18">Do their hands ever clasp such a happiness as ours ,</l>
      <l n="19">Now the waters foam about us and the grasses have their birth ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="20">Fair is their land ,— yea fair beyond all dreaming ,—</l>
      <l n="21">With its sun upon the roses and its long summer day ;</l>
      <l n="22">Yet surely they must envy us our vision of the gleaming</l>
      <l n="23">Of our lady 's white throat as she comes her ancient way .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="24">For their year is never April — Oh what were Time without her !</l>
      <l n="25">Yea , the drifted snows may cover us , yet shall we not complain :</l>
      <l n="26">Knowing well our Lady April — all her raiment blown about her —</l>
      <l n="27">Will return with many kisses for our unremembered pain !</l>

     <head>II . A ROAD SONG IN MAY .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="28">O come ! Is it not surely May ?</l>
      <l n="29">The year is at its poise today .</l>
      <l n="30">Northward , I hear the distant beat</l>
      <l n="31">Of Spring 's irrevocable feet :</l>
      <l n="32">Tomorrow June will have her way .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="33">O tawny waters , flecked with sun ,</l>
      <l n="34">Come : for your labours all are done .</l>
      <l n="35">The grey snow fadeth from the hills ;</l>
      <l n="36">And toward the sound of waking mills</l>
      <l n="37">Swing the brown rafts in , one by one .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="38">O bees among the willow-blooms ,</l>
      <l n="39">Forget your empty waxen rooms</l>
      <l n="40">Awhile , and share our golden hours !</l>
      <l n="41">Will they not come , the later flowers ,</l>
      <l n="42">With their old colours and perfumes ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="43">O wind that bloweth from the west ,</l>
      <l n="44">Is not this morning road the best ?</l>
      <l n="45">— Let us go hand in hand , as free</l>
      <l n="46">And glad as little children be</l>
      <l n="47">That follow some long-dreamed-of quest !</l>

      <l n="48">“ It well may be just as you say ,</l>

      <l n="56">“ Inland , it 's June ! And birds sing</l>
      <l n="57">Among the wooded hills , I know ;</l>
      <l n="58">Between green fields , unhastening ,</l>
      <l n="59">The Nashwaak 's shadowed waters flow .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="60">“ What know you of such things as these</l>
      <l n="61">Who have the grey sea at your door ,—</l>
      <l n="62">Whose path is as the strong winds please</l>
      <l n="63">Beyond this narrow strip of shore ? ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="64">“ Your fields and woods ! Now , answer me :</l>
      <l n="65">Up what green path have your feet run</l>
      <l n="66">So wide as mine , when the deep sea</l>
      <l n="67">Lies all-uncovered to the sun ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="68">And down the hollows of what hills</l>
      <l n="69">Have you gone — half so glad of heart</l>
      <l n="70">As you shall be when our sail fills</l>
      <l n="71">And the great waves ride far apart ? ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="72">“ O ! half your life is good to live ,</l>
      <l n="73">Will Carver ; yet , if I should go ,</l>
      <l n="74">What are the things that you can give</l>
      <l n="75">Lest I regret the things I know !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="76">“ Lest I desire the old life 's way ?</l>
      <l n="77">The noises of the crowded town ?</l>
      <l n="78">The busy streets , where , night and day ,</l>
      <l n="79">The traffickers go up and down ? ”</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="80">“ What can I give for these ? Alas ,</l>
      <l n="81">That all unchanged your path must be !</l>
      <l n="82">Strange lights shall open as we pass</l>
      <l n="83">And alien wakes traverse the sea ;</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="84">“ Your ears shall hear ( across your sleep )</l>
      <l n="85">New hails , remote , disquieted ,</l>
      <l n="86">For not a hand-breadth of the deep</l>

     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="22">
      <l n="92">“ The slow south-wind comes amorously ?</l>
      <l n="93">The sudden gleam of some far sail</l>

      <l n="95">Hastily , lest the good wind fail ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="23">
      <l n="96">“ The dreams that come ( so strange , so fair ! )</l>
      <l n="97">When all your world lies well within</l>
      <l n="98">The moving magic circle where</l>
      <l n="99">The sea ends and the skies begin ? ” ......</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="25">
      <l n="104">Just where the field becomes the wood</l>
      <l n="105">I thought I saw again</l>
      <l n="106">Her old remembered face — made grey</l>
      <l n="107">As it had known the rain .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="26">
      <l n="108">The trees grow thickly there ; no place</l>
      <l n="109">Has half so many trees ;</l>
      <l n="110">And hunted things elude one there</l>
      <l n="111">Like ancient memories .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="27">
      <l n="112">The path itself is hard to find ,</l>
      <l n="113">And slopes up suddenly ;</l>
      <l n="114">— In the old days it was a path</l>
      <l n="115">None knew so well as we .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="28">
      <l n="116">The path slopes upward , till it leaves</l>

      <l n="119">Grow up to meet the wind .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="29">
      <l n="120">Where the poplars quiver endlessly</l>

      <l n="122">I saw her come , and I was glad</l>
      <l n="123">That she had learned the way .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="30">
      <l n="124">She paused a moment where the path</l>
      <l n="125">Grew sunlighted and broad ;</l>

     <head>V. A SONG IN AUGUST .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="36">
      <l n="148">O gold is the West and gold the river-waters</l>
      <l n="149">Washing past the sides of my yellow birch canoe ,</l>
      <l n="150">Gold are the great drops that fall from my paddle ,</l>
      <l n="151">The far-off hills cry a golden word of you .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="37">
      <l n="152">I can almost see you ! Where its own shadow</l>
      <l n="153">Creeps down the hill 's side , gradual and slow .</l>
      <l n="154">There you stand waiting ; the goldenrod and thistle</l>
      <l n="155">Glad of you beside them — the fairest thing they know .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="38">
      <l n="156">Down the worn foot-path , the tufted pines behind you ,</l>
      <l n="157">Grey sheep between ,— unfrightened as you pass ;</l>
      <l n="158">Swift through the sun-glow , I to my loved one</l>
      <l n="159">Come , striving hard against the long trailing grass .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="39">
      <l n="160">Soon shall I ground on the shining gravel-reaches :</l>
      <l n="161">Through the thick alders you will break your way :</l>
      <l n="162">Then your hand in mine , and our path is on the waters ,—</l>
      <l n="163">For us the long shadows and the end of day .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="40">
      <l n="164">Whither shall we go ? See , over to the westward ,</l>
      <l n="165">An hour of precious gold standeth still for you and me ;</l>
      <l n="166">Still gleams the grain , all yellow on the uplands ;</l>
      <l n="167">West is it , or East , O Love that you would be ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="41">
      <l n="168">West now , or East ? For , underneath the moonrise ,</l>
      <l n="169">Also it is fair ; and where the reeds are tall ,</l>
      <l n="170">And the only little noise is the sound of quiet waters ,</l>
      <l n="171">Heavy , like the rain , we shall hear the duck-oats fall .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="42">
      <l n="172">And perhaps we shall see , rising slowly from the driftwood ,</l>
      <l n="173">A lone crane go over to its inland nest :</l>
      <l n="174">Or a dark line of ducks will come in across the islands</l>
      <l n="175">And sail overhead to the marshes of the west .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="43">
      <l n="176">Now a little wind rises up for our returning ;</l>
      <l n="177">Silver grows the East as the West grows grey ;</l>
      <l n="178">Shadows on the waters , shaded are the meadows ,</l>
      <l n="179">The firs on the hillside — naught so dark as they .</l>

      <l n="180">Yet we have known the light !— Was ever such an August ?</l>

      <l n="202">Before thine altar burneth the ancient fire ;</l>
      <l n="203">The blackness of the pines is still the same ,</l>
      <l n="204">And the same peace broodeth behind the hill</l>

      <l n="159">And the hillside wakes and quivers with the strength of newborn</l>
      <l n="160">rivers</l>
      <l n="161">Come to make our Northland glad and free again .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="45">
      <l n="162">O remember how the snow fell the long winter through !</l>
      <l n="163">Was it yesterday I tied your snowshoes on ?</l>
      <l n="164">All my soul grew wild with yearning for the sight of you</l>
      <l n="165">returning</l>
      <l n="166">But I waited all those hours that you were gone ,</l>
      <l n="167">For I watched you from our window through the blurring flakes</l>
      <l n="168">that fell</l>
      <l n="169">Till you gained the quiet wood , and then I knew</l>
      <l n="170">( When our pathways lay together how we revelled in such</l>
      <l n="171">weather ! )</l>
      <l n="172">That the ancient things I loved would comfort you .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="46">
      <l n="173">Now I knew that you would tarry in the shadow of the firs</l>
      <l n="174">And remember many winters overpast :</l>
      <l n="175">All the hidden signs I found you of the hiding life around you ,</l>
      <l n="176">Sleeping patient till the year should wake at last .</l>
      <l n="177">Here a tuft of fern underneath the rounded drift :</l>
      <l n="178">A rock , there , behind a covered spring ;</l>
      <l n="179">And here , nowhither tending , tracks beginning not nor ending ,—</l>
      <l n="180">Was it bird or shy four-footed furry thing ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="47">
      <l n="181">And remember how we followed down the woodman 's winding trail !</l>
      <l n="182">By the axe-strokes ringing louder , one by one ,</l>
      <l n="183">Well we knew that we were nearing now the edges of the</l>
      <l n="184">clearing ,—</l>
      <l n="185">O the gleam of chips all yellow in the sun !</l>
      <l n="186">But the twilight fell about us as we watched him at his work ;</l>
      <l n="187">And in the south a sudden moon , hung low ,</l>
      <l n="188">Beckoned us beyond the shadows — down the hill — across the</l>
      <l n="189">meadows</l>
      <l n="190">Where our little house loomed dark against the snow .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="48">
      <l n="191">And that night , too — remember ?— outside our quiet house ,</l>
      <l n="192">Just before the dawn we heard the moaning wind :</l>
      <l n="193">Only then its wings were weighted with the storm itself created</l>
      <l n="194">And it hid the very things it came to find .</l>
      <l n="195">In the morn , when we arose , and looked out across the fields ,</l>
      <l n="196">( Hark the branches ! how they shatter overhead ! )</l>
      <l n="197">Seemed it not that Time was sleeping , and the whole wide world</l>
      <l n="198">was keeping</l>
      <l n="199">All the silence of the Houses of the dead ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="49">
      <l n="200">Ah , but that was long ago ! And tonight the wind foretells</l>
      <l n="201">( Hark , above the wind , the little laughing rills ! )</l>
      <l n="202">Earth 's forgetfulness of sorrow when the dawn shall break</l>
      <l n="203">tomorrow</l>
      <l n="204">And lead me to the bases of the hills :</l>
      <l n="205">To the low southern hills where of old we used to go —</l>
      <l n="206">( Hark the rumour of ten thousand ancient Springs ! )</l>
      <l n="207">O my love , to thy dark quiet — far beyond our North 's mad riot —</l>
      <l n="208">Do thy new Gods bring remembrance of such things ?</l>
