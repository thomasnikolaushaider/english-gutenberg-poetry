    <docTitle><titlePart>GLOUCESTER MOORS A mile behind is Gloucester town Where the fishing fleets put in , A mile ahead the land dips down And the woods and farms begin . Here , where the moors stretch free In the high blue afternoon , Are the marching sun and talking sea , And the racing winds that wheel and flee On the flying heels of June . Jill-o'erhYpppHeNthehYpppHeNground is purple blue , Blue is the quaker-maid , The wild geranium holds its dew Long in the boulder 's shade . Wax-red hangs the cup From the huckleberry boughs , In barberry bells the grey moths sup , Or where the choke-cherry lifts high up Sweet bowls for their carouse . Over the shelf of the sandy cove Beach-peas blossom late . By copse and cliff the swallows rove Each calling to his mate . Seaward the sea-gulls go , And the land-birds all are here ; That green-gold flash was a vireo , And yonder flame where the marsh-flags grow Was a scarlet tanager . This earth is not the steadfast place We landsmen build upon ; From deep to deep she varies pace , And while she comes is gone . Beneath my feet I feel Her smooth bulk heave and dip ; With velvet plunge and soft upreel She swings and steadies to her keel Like a gallant , gallant ship . These summer clouds she sets for sail , The sun is her masthead light , She tows the moon like a pinnace frail Where her phosphor wake churns bright . Now hid , now looming clear , On the face of the dangerous blue The star fleets tack and wheel and veer , But on , but on does the old earth steer As if her port she knew . God , dear God ! Does she know her port , Though she goes so far about ? Or blind astray , does she make her sport To brazen and chance it out ? I watched when her captains passed : She were better captainless . Men in the cabin , before the mast , But some were reckless and some aghast , And some sat gorged at mess . By her battened hatch I leaned and caught Sounds from the noisome hold ,— Cursing and sighing of souls distraught And cries too sad to be told . Then I strove to go down and see ; But they said , “ Thou art not of us ! ” I turned to those on the deck with me And cried , “ Give help ! ” But they said , “ Let be : Our ship sails faster thus . ” Jill-o'erhYpppHeNthehYpppHeNground is purple blue , Blue is the quaker-maid , The alder-clump where the brook comes through Breeds cresses in its shade . To be out of the moiling street With its swelter and its sin ! Who has given to me this sweet , And given my brother dust to eat ? And when will his wage come in ? Scattering wide or blown in ranks , Yellow and white and brown , Boats and boats from the fishing banks Come home to Gloucester town . There is cash to purse and spend , There are wives to be embraced , Hearts to borrow and hearts to lend , And hearts to take and keep to the end ,— O little sails , make haste ! But thou , vast outbound ship of souls , What harbor town for thee ? What shapes , when thy arriving tolls , Shall crowd the banks to see ? Shall all the happy shipmates then Stand singing brotherly ? Or shall a haggard ruthless few Warp her over and bring her to , While the many broken souls of men Fester down in the slaver 's pen , And nothing to say or do ?</titlePart></docTitle>

   <head>GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT</head>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">At last the bird that sang so long</l>
     <l n="3">In twilight circles , hushed his song :</l>
     <l n="4">Above the ancient square</l>
     <l n="5">The stars came here and there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Good Friday night ! Some hearts were bowed ,</l>
     <l n="7">But some amid the waiting crowd</l>
     <l n="8">Because of too much youth</l>
     <l n="9">Felt not that mystic ruth ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">And of these hearts my heart was one :</l>
     <l n="11">Nor when beneath the arch of stone</l>
     <l n="12">With dirge and candle flame</l>
     <l n="13">The cross of passion came ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">Did my glad spirit feel reproof ,</l>
     <l n="15">Though on the awful tree aloof ,</l>
     <l n="16">Unspiritual , dead ,</l>
     <l n="17">Drooped the ensanguined Head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">To one who stood where myrtles made</l>
     <l n="19">A little space of deeper shade</l>
     <l n="20">( As I could half descry ,</l>
     <l n="21">A stranger , even as I ) ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">I said , “ These youths who bear along</l>
     <l n="23">The symbols of their Saviour 's wrong ,</l>
     <l n="24">The spear , the garment torn ,</l>
     <l n="25">The flaggel , and the thorn ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">“ Why do they make this mummery ?</l>
     <l n="27">Would not a brave man gladly die</l>
     <l n="28">For a much smaller thing</l>
     <l n="29">Than to be Christ and king ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">He answered nothing , and I turned .</l>
     <l n="31">Throned in its hundred candles burned</l>
     <l n="32">The jeweled eidolon</l>
     <l n="33">Of her who bore the Son .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">The crowd was prostrate ; still , I felt</l>
     <l n="35">No shame until the stranger knelt ;</l>
     <l n="36">Then not to kneel , almost</l>
     <l n="37">Seemed like a vulgar boast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">I knelt . The doll-face , waxen white ,</l>
     <l n="39">Flowered out a living dimness ; bright</l>
     <l n="40">Dawned the dear mortal grace</l>
     <l n="41">Of my own mother 's face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="42">When we were risen up , the street</l>
     <l n="43">Was vacant ; all the air hung sweet</l>
     <l n="44">With lemon-flowers ; and soon</l>
     <l n="45">The sky would hold the moon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">More silently than new-found friends</l>
     <l n="47">To whom much silence makes amends</l>
     <l n="48">For the much babble vain</l>
     <l n="49">While yet their lives were twain ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">We walked along the odorous hill .</l>
     <l n="51">The light was little yet ; his will</l>
     <l n="52">I could not see to trace</l>
     <l n="53">Upon his form or face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="54">So when aloft the gold moon broke ,</l>
     <l n="55">I cried , heart-stung . As one who woke</l>
     <l n="56">He turned unto my cries</l>
     <l n="57">The anguish of his eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="58">“ Friend ! Master ! ” I cried falteringly ,</l>
     <l n="59">“ Thou seest the thing they make of thee .</l>
     <l n="60">Oh , by the light divine</l>
     <l n="61">My mother shares with thine ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="62">“ I beg that I may lay my head</l>
     <l n="63">Upon thy shoulder and be fed</l>
     <l n="64">With thoughts of brotherhood ! ”</l>
     <l n="65">So through the odorous wood ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="66">More silently than friends new-found</l>
     <l n="67">We walked . At the first meadow bound</l>
     <l n="68">His figure ashen-stoled</l>
     <l n="69">Sank in the moon 's broad gold .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>ROAD-HYMN FOR THE START</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="70">Leave the early bells at chime ,</l>
     <l n="71">Leave the kindled hearth to blaze ,</l>
     <l n="72">Leave the trellised panes where children linger out the waking-time ,</l>
     <l n="73">Leave the forms of sons and fathers trudging through the misty ways ,</l>
     <l n="74">Leave the sounds of mothers taking up their sweet laborious days .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="75">Pass them by ! even while our soul</l>
     <l n="76">Yearns to them with keen distress .</l>
     <l n="77">Unto them a part is given ; we will strive to see the whole .</l>
     <l n="78">Dear shall be the banquet table where their singing spirits press ;</l>
     <l n="79">Dearer be our sacred hunger , and our pilgrim loneliness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="80">We have felt the ancient swaying</l>
     <l n="81">Of the earth before the sun ,</l>
     <l n="82">On the darkened marge of midnight heard sidereal rivers playing ;</l>
     <l n="83">Rash it was to bathe our souls there , but we plunged and all was done .</l>
     <l n="84">That is lives and lives behind us — lo , our journey is begun !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">Careless where our face is set ,</l>
     <l n="86">Let us take the open way .</l>
     <l n="87">What we are no tongue has told us : Errand-goers who forget ?</l>
     <l n="88">Soldiers heedless of their harry ? Pilgrim people gone astray ?</l>
     <l n="89">We have heard a voice cry “ Wander ! ” That was all we heard it say .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="90">Ask no more : ‘ t is much , ‘ t is much !</l>
     <l n="91">Down the road the day-star calls ;</l>
     <l n="92">Touched with change in the wide heavens , like a leaf the frost winds</l>
     <l n="93">touch ,</l>
     <l n="94">Flames the failing moon a moment , ere it shrivels white and falls ;</l>
     <l n="95">Hid aloft , a wild throat holdeth sweet and sweeter intervals .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="96">Leave him still to ease in song</l>
     <l n="97">Half his little heart 's unrest :</l>
     <l n="98">Speech is his , but we may journey toward the life for which we long .</l>
     <l n="99">God , who gives the bird its anguish , maketh nothing manifest ,</l>
     <l n="100">But upon our lifted foreheads pours the boon of endless quest .</l>

  <p>AN ODE IN TIME OF HESITATION</p>
   <p>( After seeing at Boston the statue of Robert Gould Shaw , killed while storming Fort Wagner , July 18 , 1863 , at the head of the first enlisted negro regiment , the 54th Massachusetts . )</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Before the solemn bronze Saint Gaudens made</l>
     <l n="2">To thrill the heedless passer 's heart with awe ,</l>
     <l n="3">And set here in the city 's talk and trade</l>
     <l n="4">To the good memory of Robert Shaw ,</l>
     <l n="5">This bright March morn I stand ,</l>
     <l n="6">And hear the distant spring come up the land ;</l>
     <l n="7">Knowing that what I hear is not unheard</l>
     <l n="8">Of this boy soldier and his negro band ,</l>
     <l n="9">For all their gaze is fixed so stern ahead ,</l>
     <l n="10">For all the fatal rhythm of their tread .</l>
     <l n="11">The land they died to save from death and shame</l>
     <l n="12">Trembles and waits , hearing the spring 's great name ,</l>
     <l n="13">And by her pangs these resolute ghosts are stirred .</l>

      <l n="15">Heedless ; the trees upon the Common show</l>
      <l n="16">No hint of green ; but to my listening heart</l>
      <l n="17">The still earth doth impart</l>
      <l n="18">Assurance of her jubilant emprise ,</l>
      <l n="19">And it is clear to my long-searching eyes</l>
      <l n="20">That love at last has might upon the skies .</l>
      <l n="21">The ice is runneled on the little pond ;</l>
      <l n="22">A telltale patter drips from off the trees ;</l>
      <l n="23">The air is touched with southland spiceries ,</l>
      <l n="24">As if but yesterday it tossed the frond</l>
      <l n="25">Of pendent mosses where the live-oaks grow</l>
      <l n="26">Beyond Virginia and the Carolines ,</l>
      <l n="27">Or had its will among the fruits and vines</l>

      <l n="33">Go honking northward over Tennessee ;</l>

      <l n="53">For flutter of broad phylacteries ;</l>
      <l n="54">While Shasta signals to Alaskan seas</l>

      <l n="56">To fling their icebergs thundering from the steep ,</l>
      <l n="57">And Mariposa through the purple calms</l>
      <l n="58">Gazes at far Hawaii crowned with palms</l>

      <l n="372">Had run and spread and rippled everywhere</l>
      <l n="373">Over the fields ; and in the level sun</l>
      <l n="374">Walked something like a presence and a power ,</l>

      <l n="376">To all the world , but chiefly unto me .</l>
      <l n="377">It walked before me when I went to work ,</l>

      <l n="379">Were spun upon a core of golden sound ,</l>
      <l n="380">Half-spoken words and interrupted songs</l>
      <l n="381">Of blessed promise , meant for all the world ,</l>
      <l n="382">But most for me , because I suffered most .</l>
      <l n="383">The shooting spindles , the smooth-humming wheels ,</l>
      <l n="384">The rocking webs , seemed toiling to some end</l>
      <l n="385">Beneficent and human known to them ,</l>
      <l n="386">And duly brought to pass in power and love .</l>
      <l n="387">The faces of the girls and men at work</l>
      <l n="388">Met mine with intense greeting , veiled at once ,</l>
      <l n="389">As if they knew a secret they must keep</l>
      <l n="390">For fear the joy would harm me if they told</l>
      <l n="391">Before some inkling filtered to my mind</l>
      <l n="392">In roundabout ways . When the day 's work was done</l>
      <l n="393">There lay a special silence on the fields ;</l>
      <l n="394">And , as I passed , the bushes and the trees ,</l>
      <l n="395">The very ruts and puddles of the road</l>
      <l n="396">Spoke to each other , saying it was she ,</l>
      <l n="397">The happy woman , the elected one ,</l>
      <l n="398">The vessel of strange mercy and the sign</l>
      <l n="399">Of many loving wonders done in Heaven</l>

      <l n="404">What was the matter with the evening now</l>

      <l n="406">As morning and the live-long day had been ?</l>
      <l n="407">Me , who had quite forgot what gladness was ,</l>

      <l n="414">Back there in the dark places of my mind</l>
      <l n="415">Where I had thrust it , fearing to believe</l>
      <l n="416">An unbelievable mercy , shone the news</l>
      <l n="417">Told by the village neighbors coming home</l>
      <l n="418">Last night from the great city , of a man</l>
      <l n="419">Arisen , like the first evangelists ,</l>

      <l n="425">No , no ! I did not dare to think of it ,</l>
      <l n="426">Feeling what weakness and despair would come</l>
      <l n="427">After the crazy hope broke under me .</l>
      <l n="428">I turned and started homeward , faster now ,</l>
      <l n="429">But never fast enough to leave behind</l>
      <l n="430">The voices and the troubled happiness</l>
      <l n="431">That still kept mounting , mounting like a sea ,</l>
      <l n="432">And singing far-off like a rush of wings .</l>
      <l n="433">Far down the road a yellow spot of light</l>
      <l n="434">Shone from my cottage window , rayless yet ,</l>
      <l n="435">Where the last sunset crimson caught the panes .</l>
      <l n="436">Alice had lit the lamp before she went ;</l>
      <l n="437">Her day of pity and unmirthful play</l>

      <l n="439">Until to-morrow brought her nursing-task</l>
      <l n="440">Again , and made her feel how dark and still</l>
      <l n="441">That life could be to others which to her</l>
      <l n="442">Was full of dreams that beckoned , reaching hands ,</l>
      <l n="443">And thrilling invitations young girls hear .</l>
      <l n="444">My boy was sleeping , little mind and frame</l>
      <l n="445">More tired just lying there awake two hours</l>
      <l n="446">Than with a whole day 's romp he should have been .</l>
      <l n="447">He would not know his mother had come home ;</l>

      <l n="450">For that worst love that stabs and breaks and kills .</l>
      <l n="451">This I thought over to myself by rote</l>

      <l n="454">Kept mounting , mounting round me like a sea ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="456">Before I lifted up the latch , I knew .</l>
      <l n="457">I felt no fear ; the One who waited there</l>
      <l n="458">In the low lamplight by the bed , had come</l>
      <l n="459">Because I was his sister and in need .</l>
      <l n="460">My word had got to Him somehow at last ,</l>
      <l n="461">And He had come to help me or to tell</l>
      <l n="462">Where help was to be found . It was not strange .</l>
      <l n="463">Strange only He had stayed away so long ;</l>
      <l n="464">But that should be forgotten — He was here .</l>
      <l n="465">I pushed the door wide open and looked in .</l>
      <l n="466">He had been kneeling by the bed , and now ,</l>
      <l n="467">Half-risen , kissed my boy upon the lips ,</l>
      <l n="468">Then turned and smiled and pointed with his hand .</l>
      <l n="469">I must have fallen on the threshold stone ,</l>
      <l n="470">For I remember that I felt , not saw ,</l>
      <l n="471">The resurrection glory and the peace</l>
      <l n="472">Shed from his face and raiment as He went</l>
      <l n="473">Out by the door into the evening street .</l>
      <l n="474">But when I looked , the place about the bed</l>
      <l n="475">Was yet all bathed in light , and in the midst</l>
      <l n="476">My boy lay changed ,— no longer clothed upon</l>
      <l n="477">With scraps and shreds of life , but like the child</l>
      <l n="478">Of some most fortunate mother . In a breath</l>
      <l n="479">The image faded . There he lay again</l>
      <l n="480">The same as always ; and the light was gone .</l>
      <l n="481">I sank with moans and cries beside the bed .</l>
      <l n="482">The cruelty , O Christ , the cruelty !</l>
      <l n="483">To come at last and then to go like that ,</l>
      <l n="484">Leaving the darkness deeper than before !</l>
      <l n="485">Then , though I heard no sound , I grew aware</l>
      <l n="486">Of some one standing by the open door</l>
      <l n="487">Among the dry vines rustling in the porch .</l>
      <l n="488">My heart laughed suddenly . He had come back !</l>
      <l n="489">He had come back to make the vision true .</l>
      <l n="490">He had not meant to mock me : God was God ,</l>
      <l n="491">And Christ was Christ ; there was no falsehood there .</l>
      <l n="492">I heard a quiet footstep cross the room</l>
      <l n="493">And felt a hand laid gently on my hair ,—</l>
      <l n="494">A human hand , worn hard by daily toil ,</l>
      <l n="495">Heavy with life-long struggle after bread .</l>
      <l n="496">Alice 's father . The kind homely voice</l>
      <l n="497">Had in it such strange music that I dreamed</l>
      <l n="498">Perhaps it was the Other speaking in him ,</l>
      <l n="499">Because His own bright form had made me swoon</l>
      <l n="500">With its too much of glory . What he brought</l>
      <l n="501">Was news as good as ever heavenly lips</l>
      <l n="502">Had the dear right to utter . He had been</l>
      <l n="503">All day among the crowds of curious folk</l>
      <l n="504">From the great city and the country-side</l>
      <l n="505">Gathered to watch the Healer do his work</l>
      <l n="506">Of mercy on the sick and halt and blind ,</l>
      <l n="507">And with his very eyes had seen such things</l>
      <l n="508">As awestruck men had witnessed long ago</l>
      <l n="509">In Galilee , and writ of in the Book .</l>
      <l n="510">To-morrow morning he would take me there</l>
      <l n="511">If I had strength and courage to believe .</l>
      <l n="512">It might be there was hope ; he could not say ,</l>
      <l n="513">But knew what he had seen . When he was gone</l>
      <l n="514">I lay for hours , letting the solemn waves</l>

      <l n="659">And in the curtained window of a house</l>
      <l n="660">Whence sin reeked on the night , a shameful head</l>
      <l n="661">Was silhouetted black as Satan 's face</l>
      <l n="662">Against eternal fires . I stumbled on</l>
      <l n="663">Down the dark slope that reaches riverward ,</l>
      <l n="664">Stretching blind hands to find the throat of God</l>
      <l n="665">And crush Him in his lies . The river lay</l>
      <l n="666">Coiled in its factory filth and few lean trees .</l>
      <l n="667">All was too hateful — I could not die there !</l>
      <l n="668">I whom the Spring had strained unto her breast ,</l>
      <l n="669">Whose lips had felt the wet vague lips of dawn .</l>
      <l n="670">So under the thin willows ’ leprous shade</l>
      <l n="671">And through the tangled ranks of riverweed</l>
      <l n="672">I pushed — till lo , God heard me ! I came forth</l>
      <l n="673">Where , ‘ neath the shoreless hush of region light ,</l>
      <l n="674">Through a new world , undreamed of , undesired ,</l>
      <l n="675">Beyond imagining of man 's weary heart ,</l>
      <l n="676">Far to the white marge of the wondering sea</l>
      <l n="677">This still plain widens , and this moon rains down</l>
      <l n="678">Insufferable ecstasy of peace .</l>

      <l n="679">My heart is man 's heart , strong to bear this night 's</l>

      <l n="682">Dissemble , feign a busy intercourse ;</l>
      <l n="683">The bushes deal in shadowy subterfuge ,</l>
      <l n="684">Lurk dull , dart spiteful out , make heartless signs ,</l>
      <l n="685">Utter awestricken purpose of no sense ,—</l>

      <l n="697">I dare not look again ; another gaze</l>
      <l n="698">Might drive me to the wavering coppice there ,</l>
      <l n="699">Where bat-winged madness brushed me , the wild laugh</l>
      <l n="700">Of naked nature crashed across my blood .</l>
      <l n="701">So rank it was with earthy presences ,</l>
      <l n="702">Faun-shapes in goatish dance , young witches ’ eyes</l>
      <l n="703">Slanting deep invitation , whinnying calls</l>
      <l n="704">Ambiguous , shocks and whirlwinds of wild mirth ,—</l>

      <l n="708">The dumb light ached and rummaged , and with out ,</l>
      <l n="709">The soaring splendor summoned me aloud</l>
      <l n="710">To leave the low dank thickets of the flesh</l>
      <l n="711">Where man meets beast and makes his lair with him ,</l>
      <l n="712">For spirit reaches of the strenuous vast ,</l>

      <l n="714">God breaketh at his tables and is glad .</l>
      <l n="715">I came out in the moonlight cleansed and strong ,</l>
      <l n="716">And gazed up at the lyric face to see</l>
      <l n="717">All sweetness tasted of in earthen cups</l>
      <l n="718">Ere it be dashed and spilled , all radiance flung</l>
      <l n="719">Beyond experience , every benison dream ,</l>

      <l n="731">Of all the sights that starred the dreamy year ,</l>

      <l n="738">Whose gray boughs shivered with excess of awe ,—</l>
      <l n="739">As with preluding gush of amber light ,</l>
      <l n="740">And herald trumpets softly lifted through ,</l>
      <l n="741">Across the palpitant horizon marge</l>
      <l n="742">Crocus-filleted came the singing moon .</l>
      <l n="743">Out of her changing lights I wove my youth</l>
      <l n="744">A place to dwell in , sweet and spiritual ,</l>
      <l n="745">And all the bitter years of my exile</l>
      <l n="746">My heart has called afar off unto her .</l>

      <l n="748">The futile adorations , the waste tears ,</l>
      <l n="749">The hymns that fluttered low in the false dawn ,</l>

      <l n="755">In coming through the quiet fields of space ,</l>
      <l n="756">And breathe between her passion-parted lips</l>
      <l n="757">Calling me out along the flowering road</l>

      <l n="762">The myriad silence yearns to myriad speech .</l>

      <l n="775">Was large behind Him , and the morning stars</l>
      <l n="776">Circled and sang about his face as birds</l>
      <l n="777">About the fieldward morning cottager ,</l>
      <l n="778">My coward heart said faintly , “ Let us haste !</l>
      <l n="779">Day grows and it is far to market-town . ”</l>
      <l n="780">Once where I lay in darkness after fight ,</l>

      <l n="782">Searching and searching at my muffled sense</l>
      <l n="783">Until it shook sweet pangs through all my blood ,</l>
      <l n="784">And I beheld one globed in ghostly fire</l>
      <l n="785">Singing , star-strong , her golden canticle ;</l>
      <l n="786">And her mouth sang , “ The hosts of Hate roll past ,</l>

      <l n="789">From east to west one legion ! Wilt thou strive ? ”</l>
      <l n="790">Then , since the splendor of her sword-bright gaze</l>

      <l n="794">O heart , shalt thou not once be strong to go</l>
      <l n="795">Where all sweet throats are calling , once be brave</l>
      <l n="796">To slake with deed thy dumbness ? Let us go</l>

      <l n="803">To make me clean for those near-searching eyes</l>
      <l n="804">That question yonder whether all be well ,</l>

      <l n="814">Made mention how the leas were lily-sprent ,</l>
      <l n="815">Into a land God 's eyes had looked not on</l>
      <l n="816">To love the tender bloom upon the hills .</l>
      <l n="817">To-morrow , when the fishers come at dawn</l>
      <l n="818">Upon that shell of me the sea has tossed</l>

      <l n="825">Who know so well my losses . Even you</l>

      <l n="827">And hold yourselves acquainted with the truth ,</l>

      <l n="831">Of battle ‘ neath the heaven-suspended sign ,</l>
      <l n="832">And nightly refuge ‘ neath God 's ægis-rim ;</l>
      <l n="833">Increase of wisdom , and acquaintance held</l>
      <l n="834">With the heart 's austerities ; still governance ,</l>
      <l n="835">And ripening of the blood in the weekday sun</l>
      <l n="836">To make the full-orbed consecrated fruit</l>
      <l n="837">At life 's end for the Sabbath supper meet .</l>
      <l n="838">I shall not sit beside you at that feast ,</l>
      <l n="839">For ere a seedling of my golden tree</l>
      <l n="840">Pushed off its petals to get room to grow ,</l>
      <l n="841">I stripped the boughs to make an April gaud</l>
      <l n="842">And wreathe a spendthrift garland for my hair .</l>
      <l n="843">But mine is not the failure God deplores ;</l>
      <l n="844">For I of old am beauty 's votarist ,</l>
      <l n="845">Long recreant , often foiled and led astray ,</l>
      <l n="846">But resolute at last to seek her there</l>
      <l n="847">Where most she does abide , and crave with tears</l>
      <l n="848">That she assoil me of my blemishment .</l>
      <l n="849">Low looms her singing face to point the way ,</l>
      <l n="850">Pendulous , blanched with longing , shedding flame</l>
      <l n="851">Of silver on the brown grope of the flood .</l>
      <l n="852">The stars are for me ; the horizon wakes</l>
      <l n="853">Its pilgrim chanting ; and the little sand</l>
      <l n="854">Grows musical of hope beneath my feet .</l>
      <l n="855">The waves that leap to meet my swimming breast</l>
      <l n="856">Gossip sweet secrets of the light-drenched way ,</l>
      <l n="857">And when the deep throbs of the rising surge</l>
      <l n="858">Pulse upward with me , and a rain of wings</l>
      <l n="859">Blurs round the moon 's pale place , she stoops to reach</l>
      <l n="860">Still welcome of bright hands across the wave ,</l>
      <l n="861">And sings low , low , globed all in ghostly fire ,</l>
      <l n="862">Lost verses from my youth 's gold canticle .</l>

     <l n="71">The shrill satiric fields ghastly with day ,</l>
     <l n="72">Raging to front God in his pride of sway</l>
     <l n="73">And hurl across the lifted swords of fate</l>
     <l n="74">That ringed Him where He sat</l>
     <l n="75">My puny gage of scorn and desolate hate</l>
     <l n="76">Which somehow should undo Him , after all !</l>
     <l n="77">That this girl face , expectant , virginal ,</l>
     <l n="78">Which gazes out at me</l>
     <l n="79">Boon as a sweetheart , as if nothing loth</l>
     <l n="80">( Save for the eyes , with other presage stored )</l>
     <l n="81">To pledge me troth ,</l>
     <l n="82">And in the kingdom where the heart is lord</l>
     <l n="83">Take sail on the terrible gladness of the deep</l>
     <l n="84">Whose winds the gray Norns keep ,—</l>
     <l n="85">That this should be indeed</l>
     <l n="86">The flesh which caught my soul , a flying seed ,</l>
     <l n="87">Out of the to and fro</l>
     <l n="88">Of scattering hands where the seedsman Mage ,</l>
     <l n="89">Stooping from star to star and age to age</l>
     <l n="90">Sings as he sows !</l>
     <l n="91">That underneath this breast</l>
     <l n="92">Nine moons I fed</l>
     <l n="93">Deep of divine unrest ,</l>
     <l n="94">While over and over in the dark she said ,</l>
     <l n="95">“ Blessèd ! but not as happier children blessed ” —</l>
     <l n="96">That this should be</l>
     <l n="97">Even she ....</l>
     <l n="98">God , how with time and change</l>
     <l n="99">Thou makest thy footsteps strange !</l>
     <l n="100">Ah , now I know</l>
     <l n="101">They play upon me , and it is not so .</l>
     <l n="102">Why , ‘ t is a girl I never saw before ,</l>
     <l n="103">A little thing to flatter and make weep ,</l>
     <l n="104">To tease until her heart is sore ,</l>
     <l n="105">Then kiss and clear the score ;</l>
     <l n="106">A gypsy run-the-fields ,</l>
     <l n="107">A little liberal daughter of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="108">Good for what hour of truancy and mirth</l>
     <l n="109">The careless season yields</l>
     <l n="110">Hither-side the flood o ’ the year and yonder of the neap ;</l>
     <l n="111">Then thank you , thanks again , and twenty light good-byes .—</l>
     <l n="112">O shrined above the skies ,</l>
     <l n="113">Frown not , clear brow ,</l>
     <l n="114">Darken not , holy eyes !</l>
     <l n="115">Thou knowest well I know that it is thou !</l>
     <l n="116">Only to save me from such memories</l>
     <l n="117">As would unman me quite ,</l>
     <l n="118">Here in this web of strangeness caught</l>
     <l n="119">And prey to troubled thought</l>
     <l n="120">Do I devise</l>
     <l n="121">These foolish shifts and slight ;</l>
     <l n="122">Only to shield me from the afflicting sense</l>
     <l n="123">Of some waste influence</l>
     <l n="124">Which from this morning face and lustrous hair</l>
     <l n="125">Breathes on me sudden ruin and despair .</l>
     <l n="126">In any other guise ,</l>
     <l n="127">With any but this girlish depth of gaze ,</l>
     <l n="128">Your coming had not so unsealed and poured</l>
     <l n="129">The dusty amphoras where I had stored</l>
     <l n="130">The drippings of the winepress of my days .</l>
     <l n="131">I think these eyes foresee ,</l>
     <l n="132">Now in their unawakened virgin time ,</l>
     <l n="133">Their mother 's pride in me ,</l>
     <l n="134">And dream even now , unconsciously ,</l>
     <l n="135">Upon each soaring peak and sky-hung lea</l>
     <l n="136">You pictured I should climb .</l>
     <l n="137">Broken premonitions come ,</l>
     <l n="138">Shapes , gestures visionary ,</l>
     <l n="139">Not as once to maiden Mary</l>
     <l n="140">The manifest angel with fresh lilies came</l>
     <l n="141">Intelligibly calling her by name ;</l>
     <l n="142">But vanishingly , dumb ,</l>
     <l n="143">Thwarted and bright and wild ,</l>
     <l n="144">As heralding a sin-defiled ,</l>
     <l n="145">Earth-encumbered , blood-begotten , passionate man-child ,</l>
     <l n="146">Who yet should be a trump of mighty call</l>
     <l n="147">Blown in the gates of evil kings</l>
     <l n="148">To make them fall ;</l>
     <l n="149">Who yet should be a sword of flame before</l>
     <l n="150">The soul 's inviolate door</l>
     <l n="151">To beat away the clang of hellish wings ;</l>
     <l n="152">Who yet should be a lyre</l>
     <l n="153">Of high unquenchable desire</l>
     <l n="154">In the day of little things .—</l>
     <l n="155">Look , where the amphoras ,</l>
     <l n="156">The yield of many days ,</l>
     <l n="157">Trod by my hot soul from the pulp of self</l>
     <l n="158">And set upon the shelf</l>
     <l n="159">In sullen pride</l>
     <l n="160">The Vineyard-master 's tasting to abide —</l>
     <l n="161">O mother mine !</l>
     <l n="162">Are these the bringings-in , the doings fine ,</l>
     <l n="163">Of him you used to praise ?</l>
     <l n="164">Emptied and overthrown</l>
     <l n="165">The jars lie strown .</l>
     <l n="166">These , for their flavor duly nursed ,</l>
     <l n="167">Drip from the stopples vinegar accursed ;</l>
     <l n="168">These , I thought honied to the very seal ,</l>
     <l n="169">Dry , dry ,— a little acid meal ,</l>
     <l n="170">A pinch of mouldy dust ,</l>
     <l n="171">Sole leavings of the amber-mantling must ;</l>
     <l n="172">These , rude to look upon ,</l>
     <l n="173">But flasking up the liquor dearest won ,</l>
     <l n="174">Through sacred hours and hard ,</l>
     <l n="175">With watching and with wrestlings and with grief ,</l>
     <l n="176">Even of these , of these in chief ,</l>
     <l n="177">The stale breath sickens , reeking from the shard .</l>
     <l n="178">Nothing is left . Ay , how much less than naught !</l>
     <l n="179">What shall be said or thought</l>
     <l n="180">Of the slack hours and waste imaginings ,</l>
     <l n="181">The cynic rending of the wings ,</l>
     <l n="182">Known to that froward , that unreckoning heart</l>
     <l n="183">Whereof this brewage was the precious part ,</l>
     <l n="184">Treasured and set away with furtive boast ?</l>
     <l n="185">O dear and cruel ghost ,</l>
     <l n="186">Be merciful , be just !</l>
     <l n="187">See , I was yours and I am in the dust .</l>
     <l n="188">Then look not so , as if all things were well !</l>
     <l n="189">Take your eyes from me , leave me to my shame ,</l>
     <l n="190">Or else , if gaze they must ,</l>
     <l n="191">Steel them with judgment , darken them with blame ;</l>
     <l n="192">But by the ways of light ineffable</l>
     <l n="193">You bade me go and I have faltered from ,</l>
     <l n="194">By the low waters moaning out of hell</l>
     <l n="195">Whereto my feet have come ,</l>
     <l n="196">Lay not on me these intolerable</l>
     <l n="197">Looks of rejoicing love , of pride , of happy trust !</l>
