    <docTitle><titlePart>Selected Poems of Oscar Wilde It is thought that a selection from Oscar Wilde 's early verses may be of interest to a large public at present familiar only with the always popular BALLAD OF READING GAOL , also included in this volume . The poems were first collected by their author when he was twenty-sex years old , and though never , until recently , well received by the critics , have survived the test of NINE editions . Readers will be able to make for themselves the obvious and striking contrasts between these first and last phases of Oscar Wilde 's literary activity . The intervening period was devoted almost entirely to dramas , prose , fiction , essays , and criticism .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>NOTE</head>
    <head>At the end of the complete text will be found a shorter version based on the original draft of the poem . This is included for the benefit of reciters and their audiences who have found the entire poem too long for declamation . I have tried to obviate a difficulty , without officiously exercising the ungrateful prerogatives of a literary executor , by falling back on a text which represents the author 's first scheme for a poem -  never intended of course for recitation .</head>

     <l n="72">Caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly :</l>
     <l n="73">With such glad dreams I sought this holy place ,</l>
     <l n="74">And now with wondering eyes and heart I stand</l>
     <l n="75">Before this supreme mystery of Love :</l>
     <l n="76">Some kneeling girl with passionless pale face ,</l>
     <l n="77">An angel with a lily in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="78">And over both the white wings of a Dove .</l>

   <note>In this poem the author laments the growth of materialism in the nineteenth century . He hails Keats and Shelley and some of the poets and artists who were his contemporaries , although his seniors , as the torch-bearers of the intellectual life . Among these are Swinburne , William Morris , Rossetti , and Brune-Jones .</note>

     <l n="169">Flame-jewelled censers the young deacons swing ,</l>
     <l n="170">When the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine ,</l>
     <l n="171">And makes God 's body from the common fruit of corn and vine .</l>

     <l n="172">Poor Fra Giovanni bawling at the Mass</l>
     <l n="173">Were out of tune now , for a small brown bird</l>
     <l n="174">Sings overhead , and through the long cool grass</l>
     <l n="175">I see that throbbing throat which once I heard</l>
     <l n="176">On starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady ,</l>

     <l n="181">Her little lonely bed , and carols blithe</l>
     <l n="182">To see the heavy-lowing cattle wait</l>

     <l n="193">The song of Linus through a sunny dell</l>
     <l n="194">Of warm Arcadia where the corn is gold</l>
     <l n="195">And the slight lithe-limbed reapers dance about the wattled fold .</l>

     <l n="251">Poem : Flower of Love</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Sweet , I blame you not , for mine the fault was , had I not been made of common clay I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed yet , seen the fuller air , the larger day .</p>
   <p>From the wildness of my wasted passion I had struck a better , clearer song , Lit some lighter light of freer freedom , battled with some Hydra-headed wrong .</p>
   <p>Had my lips been smitten into music by the kisses that but made them bleed , You had walked with Bice and the angels on that verdant and enamelled mead .</p>
   <p>I had trod the road which Dante treading saw the suns of seven circles shine , Ay ! perchance had seen the heavens opening , as they opened to the Florentine .</p>
   <p>And the mighty nations would have crowned me , who am crownless now and without name , And some orient dawn had found me kneeling on the threshold of the House of Fame .</p>
   <p>I had sat within that marble circle where the oldest bard is as the young , And the pipe is ever dropping honey , and the lyre 's strings are ever strung .</p>
   <p>Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out the poppy-seeded wine , With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead , clasped the hand of noble love in mine .</p>
   <p>And at springtide , when the apple-blossoms brush the burnished bosom of the dove , Two young lovers lying in an orchard would have read the story of our love ;</p>
   <p>Would have read the legend of my passion , known the bitter secret of my heart , Kissed as we have kissed , but never parted as we two are fated now to part .</p>
   <p>For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by the cankerworm of truth , And no hand can gather up the fallen withered petals of the rose of youth .</p>
   <p>Yet I am not sorry that I loved you -  ah ! what else had I a boy to do , -  For the hungry teeth of time devour , and the silent-footed years pursue .</p>
   <p>Rudderless , we drift athwart a tempest , and when once the storm of youth is past , Without lyre , without lute or chorus , Death the silent pilot comes at last .</p>
   <p>And within the grave there is no pleasure , for the blindworm battens on the root , And Desire shudders into ashes , and the tree of Passion bears no fruit .</p>
   <p>Ah ! what else had I to do but love you ? God 's own mother was less dear to me , And less dear the Cytheraean rising like an argent lily from the sea .</p>
   <p>I have made my choice , have lived my poems , and , though youth is gone in wasted days , I have found the lover 's crown of myrtle better than the poet 's crown of bays .</p>
