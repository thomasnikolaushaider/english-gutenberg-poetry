      <head>NEUTRAL</head>
       <l n="1">That pale word ‘ Neutral ’ sits becomingly</l>
       <l n="2">On lips of weaklings . But the men whose brains</l>
       <l n="3">Find fuel in their blood , the men whose minds</l>
       <l n="4">Hold sympathetic converse with their hearts ,</l>
       <l n="5">Such men are never neutral . That word stands</l>
       <l n="6">Unsexed and impotent in Realms of Speech .</l>
       <l n="7">When mighty problems face a startled world</l>
       <l n="8">No virile man is neutral . Right or wrong</l>
       <l n="9">His thoughts go forth , assertive , unafraid</l>
       <l n="10">To stand by his convictions , and to do</l>
       <l n="11">Their part in shaping issues to an end .</l>
       <l n="12">Silence may guard the door of useless words ,</l>
       <l n="13">At dictate of Discretion ; but to stand</l>
       <l n="14">Without opinions in a world which needs</l>
       <l n="15">Constructive thinking , is a coward 's part .</l>

       <l n="4">And now we separate .</l>
       <l n="5">Soon , all too soon ,</l>

       <l n="9">Was wholly gone .</l>
       <l n="10">And yet we two were forced to follow on -</l>
       <l n="11">Leagues , leagues apart while ever side by side .</l>
       <l n="12">Darker and darker grew the loveless weather ,</l>
       <l n="13">Darker the way ,</l>
       <l n="14">Until we could not stay</l>
       <l n="15">Longer together .</l>
       <l n="16">Now that all anger from our hearts has died ,</l>
       <l n="17">And love has flown far from its ruined nest ,</l>

       <l n="22">By generous love . Hate never framed a curse</l>

       <l n="27">A cold , rude thing it needs the nicest touch</l>
       <l n="28">Of thought and speech when it approaches love ,</l>

       <l n="11">Why , if each dweller on this little globe</l>

       <l n="13">And understand its deep significance ,</l>
       <l n="14">Men 's thoughts would form in beauty , till their dreams</l>

       <l n="5">But suddenly earth seemed Arcady , and life grew young and sweet .</l>
       <l n="6">For the city street fled , and the world was green , and a little house</l>
       <l n="7">stood by the sea ;</l>
       <l n="8">And she came singing a martial air ( she who was peace itself ) ;</l>
       <l n="9">She brought back with her the old , strange charm , of mingled pathos</l>

     <p>But now she had come , for I saw her there , and she looked so blithe and young ; ( Not white and still , as I saw her last ) and the rose that she wore was red ; And her voice soared up in a bird-like trill , at the end of the song she sung , And she mimicked a soldier 's warlike stride , and tossed back her dear little head .</p>

      <head>THE PENDULUM</head>
      <note>In Edgar Allan Poe 's story , ‘ The Pit and the Pendulum , ’ the victim is bound hand and foot , face upturned to a huge , knife-edged pendulum which swings back and forth across his body , the blade dropping closer to his heart at each swing .</note>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Bound hand and foot in the pit I lie ,</l>

       <l n="4">With maximum labour and minimum pay ;</l>

       <l n="8">But the devil of greed has given a hope .</l>
       <l n="9">He swings before me the pendulum — Vice ;</l>
       <l n="10">I know its purpose and know its price ,</l>

       <l n="12">As never an audible orchestra made .</l>

       <l n="14">Aquiver with life is each leaf on the tree ,</l>

       <l n="20">A vagabond thing , with a vagabond throng ,</l>

       <l n="22">With winds and with sunbeams , and tree-tops and birds ,</l>

       <l n="24">To songs without music and verse without words .</l>

     <p>No ; God is no longer in heaven ; He has come down on earth to see That nothing is wrong with the world He made ; THE WRONG IS IN YOU AND ME . He meant the earth for a garden-spot , where mill and factory stand ; Childhood , he meant for growing-time — but look at the toiling band ! Woman was meant for mother and mate — now look at the slaves of lust . And the good folks shake their heads and say , ‘ We must pray to God and trust . ’ God has a billion books of our prayers unopened upon his shelves , For the things we are begging Him to do , He wants us to do ourselves .</p>

      <head>THE ANSWER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Up to the gates of gleaming Pearl ,</l>
       <l n="2">There came the spirit of a girl ,</l>
       <l n="3">And to the white-robed Guard she said :</l>
       <l n="4">‘ Dear Angel , am I truly dead ?</l>
       <l n="5">Just yonder , lying on my bed ,</l>
       <l n="6">I heard them say it ; and they wept .</l>
       <l n="7">And after that , methinks I slept .</l>
       <l n="8">Then when I woke , I saw your face ,</l>
       <l n="9">And suddenly was in this place .</l>
       <l n="10">It seems a pleasant place to be ,</l>
       <l n="11">Yet earth was fair enough to me .</l>
       <l n="12">What is there here , to do , or see ?</l>
       <l n="13">Will I see God , dear Angel , say ?</l>
       <l n="14">And is He very far away ? ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">The Angel said , ‘ You are in truth</l>
       <l n="16">What men call dead . That word to youth</l>
       <l n="17">Is full of terror ; but it means</l>
       <l n="18">Only a change of tasks , and scenes .</l>
       <l n="19">You have been brought to us because</l>
       <l n="20">Of certain ancient karmic laws</l>
       <l n="21">Set into motion aeons gone .</l>
       <l n="22">By us you will be guided on</l>
       <l n="23">From plane to plane , and sphere to sphere ,</l>
       <l n="24">Until your tasks are finished here .</l>
       <l n="25">Then back to earth , the home of man ,</l>
       <l n="26">To work again another span . ’</l>

       <l n="30">To see , or hear , or own , or have</l>
       <l n="31">Aught beside — HIM . Then shall His face</l>
       <l n="32">Reveal itself to you in space .</l>
       <l n="33">And you shall find yourself made one</l>
       <l n="34">With that Great Sun , behind the sun .</l>
       <l n="35">Child , go thy way inside the gate ,</l>
       <l n="36">Where many eager loved ones wait .</l>

      <head>A VISION</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">My soul beheld a vision of the Master :</l>
       <l n="2">Methought He stood with grieved and questioning eyes ,</l>
       <l n="3">Where Freedom drove its chariot to disaster</l>
       <l n="4">And toilers heard , unheeding , toilers ’ cries .</l>
       <l n="5">Where man withheld God 's bounties from his neighbour ,</l>
       <l n="6">And fertile fields were sterilised by greed ;</l>
       <l n="7">Where Labour 's hand was lifted against labour ,</l>
       <l n="8">And suffering serfs to despots turned when freed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Majestic rose tall steeple after steeple ;</l>
       <l n="10">Imperious bells called worshippers to prayer ;</l>
       <l n="11">But as they passed , the faces of the people</l>
       <l n="12">Were marred by envy , anger and despair .</l>
       <l n="13">‘ Christ the Redeemer of the world has risen ,</l>
       <l n="14">Peace and good will , ’ so rang the major strain ;</l>
       <l n="15">But forth from sweat-shops , tenement and prison</l>
       <l n="16">Wailed minor protests , redolent with pain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">Methought about the Master , all unseeing ,</l>
       <l n="18">Fought desperate hosts of striking clan with clan ,</l>
       <l n="19">Their primal purpose , meant for labour 's freeing ,</l>
       <l n="20">Sunk in vindictive hate of man for man .</l>
       <l n="21">Pretentious Wealth , in unearned robes of beauty ,</l>
       <l n="22">Flung Want a pittance from her bulging purse ,</l>
       <l n="23">While ill-paid Toil went on dull rounds of duty ,</l>
       <l n="24">Hell in her heart , and on her lips a curse .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">Then spoke the Christ ( so wondrous was my vision )</l>
       <l n="26">( Deep , deep , His voice , with sorrow 's cadence fraught ):</l>
       <l n="27">‘ This world to-day would be a realm elysian</l>
       <l n="28">Had my disciples lived the love I taught .</l>
       <l n="29">Un-Christlike is the Christian creed men fashion</l>
       <l n="30">Who kneel to worship , and who rise to slay .</l>
       <l n="31">Profane pretenders of my holy Passion ,</l>
       <l n="32">Ye nail Me newly to the cross each day . ’</l>
