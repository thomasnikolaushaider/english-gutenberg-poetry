    <docImprint>Strike hands for faith , and power To gladden the passing hour ; To wield the sword , or raise a song ;— To press the grape ; or crush out wrong . And strengthen right . Give me the man of sturdy palm And vigorous brain ; Hearty , companionable , sane , ‘ Mid all commotions calm , Yet filled with quick , enthusiastic fire ;— Give me the man Whose impulses aspire , And all his features seem to say , “ I can ! ” Strike hands , young men ! ‘ Tis yours to help rebuild the State , And keep the Nation great . With act and speech and pen ‘ Tis yours to spread The morning-red That ushers in a grander day : To scatter prejudice that blinds , And hail fresh thoughts in noble minds ; To overthrow bland tyrannies That cheat the people , and with slow disease Change the Republic to a mockery . Your words can teach that liberty Means more than just to cry “ We 're free ” While bending to some new-found yoke . So shall each unjust bond be broke , Each toiler gain his meet reward , And life sound forth a truer chord . Ah , if we so have striven , And mutually the grasp have given Of brotherhood , To work each other and the whole race good ; What matter if the dream Come only partly true , And all the things accomplished seem Feeble and few ? At least , when summer 's flame burns low And on our heads the drifting snow Settles and stays , We shall rejoice that in our earlier days We boldly then Struck hands , young men !</docImprint>

   <p>“ O JAY ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O jay —</l>
     <l n="2">Blue-jay !</l>
     <l n="3">What are you trying to say ?</l>
     <l n="4">I remember , in the spring</l>
     <l n="5">You pretended you could sing ;</l>
     <l n="6">But your voice is now still queerer ,</l>
     <l n="7">And as yet you 've come no nearer</l>
     <l n="8">To a song .</l>
     <l n="9">In fact , to sum the matter ,</l>
     <l n="10">I never heard a flatter</l>
     <l n="11">Failure than your doleful clatter .</l>
     <l n="12">Do n't you think it 's wrong ?</l>
     <l n="13">It was sweet to hear your note ,</l>
     <l n="14">I 'll not deny ,</l>
     <l n="15">When April set pale clouds afloat</l>
     <l n="16">O'er the blue tides of sky ,</l>
     <l n="17">And ‘ mid the wind 's triumphant drums</l>
     <l n="18">You , in your white and azure coat ,</l>
     <l n="19">A herald proud , came forth to cry ,</l>
     <l n="20">“ The royal summer comes ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="21">But now that autumn 's here ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the leaves curl up in sheer</l>
     <l n="23">Disgust ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the cold rains fringe the pine ,</l>
     <l n="25">You really must</l>
     <l n="26">Stop that supercilious whine — -</l>
     <l n="27">Or you 'll be shot , by some mephitic</l>
     <l n="28">Angry critic .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">You do n't fulfill your early promise :</l>
     <l n="30">You 're not the smartest</l>
     <l n="31">Kind of artist ,</l>
     <l n="32">Any more than poor Blind Tom is .</l>
     <l n="33">Yet somehow , still ,</l>
     <l n="34">There 's meaning in your screaming bill .</l>
     <l n="35">What are you trying to say ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="36">Sometimes your piping is delicious ,</l>
     <l n="37">And then again it 's simply vicious ;</l>
     <l n="38">Though on the whole the varying jangle</l>
     <l n="39">Weaves round me an entrancing tangle</l>
     <l n="40">Of memories grave or joyous :</l>
     <l n="41">Things to weep or laugh at ;</l>
     <l n="42">Love that lived at a hint , or</l>
     <l n="43">Days so sweet , they 'd cloy us ;</l>
     <l n="44">Nights I have spent with friends ;—</l>
     <l n="45">Glistening groves of winter ,</l>
     <l n="46">And the sound of vanished feet</l>
     <l n="47">That walked by the ripening wheat ;</l>
     <l n="48">With other things .... Not the half that</l>
     <l n="49">Your cry familiar blends</l>
     <l n="50">Can I name , for it is mostly</l>
     <l n="51">Very ghostly ;—</l>
     <l n="52">Such mixed-up things your voice recalls ,</l>
     <l n="53">With its peculiar quirks and falls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="54">Possibly , then , your meaning , plain ,</l>
     <l n="55">Is that your harsh and broken strain</l>
     <l n="56">Tallies best with a world of pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="57">Well , I 'll admit</l>
     <l n="58">There 's merit in a voice that 's truthful :</l>
     <l n="59">Yours is not honey-sweet nor youthful ,</l>
     <l n="60">But querulously fit .</l>
     <l n="61">And if we cannot sing , we 'll say</l>
     <l n="62">Something to the purpose , jay !</l>

    <head>THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Go , ” said the star to its light :</l>
     <l n="2">“ Follow your fathomless flight !</l>
     <l n="3">Into the dreams of space</l>
     <l n="4">Carry the joy of my face .</l>
     <l n="5">Go , ” said the star to its light :</l>
     <l n="6">“ Tell me the tale of your flight . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">As the mandate rang</l>
     <l n="8">The heavens through ,</l>
     <l n="9">Quick the ray sprang :</l>
     <l n="10">Unheard it flew ,</l>
     <l n="11">Sped by the touch of an unseen spur .</l>
     <l n="12">It crumbled the dusk of the deep</l>
     <l n="13">That folds the worlds in sleep ,</l>
     <l n="14">And shot through night with noiseless stir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Then came the day ;</l>
     <l n="16">And all that swift array</l>
     <l n="17">Of diamond-sparkles died .</l>
     <l n="18">And lo ! the far star cried :</l>
     <l n="19">“ My light has lost its way ! ”</l>
     <l n="20">Ages on ages passed :</l>
     <l n="21">The light returned , at last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">“ What have you seen ,</l>
     <l n="23">What have you heard —</l>
     <l n="24">O ray serene ,</l>
     <l n="25">O flame-winged bird</l>
     <l n="26">I loosed on endless air ?</l>
     <l n="27">Why do you look so faint and white ? ” —</l>
     <l n="28">Said the star to its light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">“ O star , ” said the tremulous ray ,</l>
     <l n="30">“ Grief and struggle I found .</l>
     <l n="31">Horror impeded my way .</l>
     <l n="32">Many a star and sun</l>
     <l n="33">I passed and touched , on my round .</l>
     <l n="34">Many a life undone</l>
     <l n="35">I lit with a tender gleam :</l>
     <l n="36">I shone in the lover 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="37">And soothed the maiden 's dream .</l>
     <l n="38">But alas for the stifling mist of lies !</l>
     <l n="39">Alas , for the wrath of the battle-field</l>
     <l n="40">Where my glance was mixed with blood !</l>
     <l n="41">And woe for the hearts by hate congealed ,</l>
     <l n="42">And the crime that rolls like a flood !</l>
     <l n="43">Too vast is the world for me ;</l>
     <l n="44">Too vast for the sparkling dew</l>
     <l n="45">Of a force like yours to renew .</l>
     <l n="46">Hopeless the world 's immensity !</l>
     <l n="47">The suns go on without end :</l>
     <l n="48">The universe holds no friend :</l>
     <l n="49">And so I come back to you . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="50">“ Go , ” said the star to its light :</l>
     <l n="51">“ You have not told me aright .</l>
     <l n="52">This you have taught : I am one</l>
     <l n="53">In a million of million others —</l>
     <l n="54">Stars , or planets , or men ;—</l>
     <l n="55">And all of these are my brothers .</l>
     <l n="56">Carry that message , and then</l>
     <l n="57">My guerdon of praise you have won !</l>
     <l n="58">Say that I serve in my place :</l>
     <l n="59">Say I will hide my own face</l>
     <l n="60">Ere the sorrows of others I shun .</l>
     <l n="61">So , then , my trust you 'll requite .</l>
     <l n="62">Go ! ” — said the star to its light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="63">“ THE SUNSHINE OF THINE EYES ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">The sunshine of thine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="65">( O still , celestial beam ! )</l>
     <l n="66">Whatever it touches it fills</l>
     <l n="67">With the life of its lambent gleam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="68">The sunshine of thine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="69">O let it fall on me !</l>
     <l n="70">Though I be but a mote of the air ,</l>
     <l n="71">I could turn to gold for thee !</l>

    <head>JESSAMINE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Here stands the great tree still , with broad bent head ;</l>
     <l n="2">Its wide arms grown aweary , yet outspread</l>
     <l n="3">With their old blessing . But wan memory weaves</l>
     <l n="4">Strange garlands , now , amongst the darkening leaves .</l>
     <l n="5">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Beneath these glimmering arches Jessamine</l>
     <l n="7">Walked with her lover long ago ; and in</l>
     <l n="8">The leaf-dimmed light he questioned , and she spoke ;</l>
     <l n="9">Then on them both , supreme , love 's radiance broke .</l>
     <l n="10">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Sweet Jessamine we called her ; for she shone</l>
     <l n="12">Like blossoms that in sun and shade have grown ,</l>
     <l n="13">Gathering from each alike a perfect white ,</l>
     <l n="14">Whose rich bloom breaks opaque through darkest night .</l>
     <l n="15">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">For this her sweetness Walt , her lover , sought</l>
     <l n="17">To win her ; wooed her here , his heart o'er fraught</l>
     <l n="18">With fragrance of her being ; and gained his plea .</l>
     <l n="19">So “ We will wed , ” they said , “ beneath this tree . ”</l>
     <l n="20">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">Yet dreams of conquering greater prize for her</l>
     <l n="22">Roused his wild spirit with a glittering spur .</l>
     <l n="23">Eager for wealth , far , far from home he sailed ;</l>
     <l n="24">And life paused ;— while she watched joy vanish , veiled .</l>
     <l n="25">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">Ah , better at the elm-tree 's sunbrowned feet</l>
     <l n="27">If he had been content to let life fleet</l>
     <l n="28">Its wonted way !— lord of his little farm ,</l>
     <l n="29">In zest of joys or cares unmixed with harm .</l>
     <l n="30">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="31">For , as against a snarling sea one steers ,</l>
     <l n="32">He battled vainly with the surging years ;</l>
     <l n="33">While ever Jessamine must watch and pine ,</l>
     <l n="34">Her vision bounded by the bleak sea-line .</l>
     <l n="35">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="36">Then silence fell ; and all the neighbors said</l>
     <l n="37">That Walt had married , faithless , or was dead :</l>
     <l n="38">Unmoved in constancy , her tryst she kept ,</l>
     <l n="39">Each night beneath the tree , ere sorrow slept .</l>
     <l n="40">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="41">So , circling years went by , till in her face</l>
     <l n="42">Slow melancholy wrought a mingled grace ,</l>
     <l n="43">Of early joy with suffering 's hard alloy —</l>
     <l n="44">Refined and rare , no doom could e'er destroy .</l>
     <l n="45">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="46">Sometimes at twilight , when sweet Jessamine</l>
     <l n="47">Slow-footed , weary-eyed , passed by to win</l>
     <l n="48">The elm , we smiled for pity of her , and mused</l>
     <l n="49">On love that so could live , with love refused .</l>
     <l n="50">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="51">And none could hope for her . But she had grown</l>
     <l n="52">Too high in love , for hope . She bloomed alone ,</l>
     <l n="53">Aloft in proud devotion ; and secure</l>
     <l n="54">Against despair ; so sweet her faith , so sure .</l>
     <l n="55">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="56">Her wandering lover knew not well her soul .</l>
     <l n="57">Discouraged , on disaster 's changing shoal</l>
     <l n="58">Stranding , he waited ; starved on selfish pride ,</l>
     <l n="59">Long years ; nor would obey love 's homeward tide .</l>
     <l n="60">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="61">But , bitterly repenting of his sin ,</l>
     <l n="62">Deeper at last he learned to look within</l>
     <l n="63">Sweet Jessamine 's true heart — when the past , dead ,</l>
     <l n="64">Mocked him with wasted years forever fled .</l>
     <l n="65">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="66">Late , late , oh late , beneath the tree stood two ;</l>
     <l n="67">In trembling joy , and wondering “ Is it true ? ” —</l>
     <l n="68">Two that were each like some strange , misty wraith :</l>
     <l n="69">Yet each on each gazed with a living faith .</l>
     <l n="70">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="71">Even to the tree-top sang the wedding-bell :</l>
     <l n="72">Even to the tree-top tolled the passing knell .</l>
     <l n="73">Beneath it Walt and Jessamine were wed ,</l>
     <l n="74">Beneath it many a year has she lain dead .</l>
     <l n="75">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="76">Here stands the great tree , still . But age has crept</l>
     <l n="77">Through every coil , while Walt each night has kept</l>
     <l n="78">The tryst alone . Hark ! with what windy might</l>
     <l n="79">The boughs chant o'er her grave their burial-rite !</l>
     <l n="80">And the moon hangs low in the elm .</l>

     <l n="1">How sweetly sang the bobolink ,</l>
     <l n="2">When thou , my love , wast nigh !</l>
     <l n="3">His liquid music from the brink</l>

     <l n="1">With my beloved I lingered late one night .</l>
     <l n="2">At last the hour when I must leave her came :</l>
     <l n="3">But , as I turned , a fear I could not name</l>
     <l n="4">Possessed me that the long sweet evening might</l>
     <l n="5">Prelude some sudden storm , whereby delight</l>
     <l n="6">Should perish . What if death , ere dawn , should claim</l>
     <l n="7">One of us ? What , though living , not the same</l>
     <l n="8">Each should appear to each in morning-light ?</l>

     <l n="9">Changed did I find her , truly , the next day :</l>
     <l n="10">Ne'er could I see her as of old again .</l>
     <l n="11">That strange mood seemed to draw a cloud away ,</l>
     <l n="12">And let her beauty pour through every vein</l>
     <l n="13">Sunlight and life , part of me . Thus the lover</l>
     <l n="14">With each new morn a new world may discover .</l>

    <head>YOUTH TO THE POET</head>
    <head>( TO OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES )</head>
     <l n="1">Strange spell of youth for age , and age for youth ,</l>
     <l n="2">Affinity between two forms of truth !—</l>
     <l n="3">As if the dawn and sunset watched each other ,</l>
     <l n="4">Like and unlike as children of one mother</l>
     <l n="5">And wondering at the likeness . Ardent eyes</l>
     <l n="6">Of young men see the prophecy arise</l>
     <l n="7">Of what their lives shall be when all is told ;</l>
     <l n="8">And , in the far-off glow of years called old ,</l>
     <l n="9">Those other eyes look back to catch a trace</l>
     <l n="10">Of what was once their own unshadowed grace .</l>
     <l n="11">But here in our dear poet both are blended —</l>
     <l n="12">Ripe age begun , yet golden youth not ended ;—</l>
     <l n="13">Even as his song the willowy scent of spring</l>
     <l n="14">Doth blend with autumn 's tender mellowing ,</l>
     <l n="15">And mixes praise with satire , tears with fun ,</l>
     <l n="16">In strains that ever delicately run ;</l>
     <l n="17">So musical and wise , page after page ,</l>
     <l n="18">The sage a minstrel grows , the bard a sage .</l>
     <l n="19">The dew of youth fills yet his late-sprung flowers ,</l>
     <l n="20">And day-break glory haunts his evening hours .</l>
     <l n="21">Ah , such a life prefigures its own moral :</l>
     <l n="22">That first “ Last Leaf ” is now a leaf of laurel ,</l>
     <l n="23">Which — smiling not , but trembling at the touch —</l>
     <l n="24">Youth gives back to the hand that gave so much .</l>

   <p>MARTHY VIRGINIA 'S HAND</p>
   <p>“ There , on the left ! ” said the colonel : the battle had shuddered and faded away , Wraith of a fiery enchantment that left only ashes and blood-sprinkled clay — “ Ride to the left and examine that ridge , where the enemy 's sharpshooters stood . Lord , how they picked off our men , from the treacherous vantage-ground of the wood ! But for their bullets , I 'll bet , my batteries sent them something as good . Go and explore , and report to me then , and tell me how many we killed . Never a wink shall I sleep till I know our vengeance was duly fulfilled . ”</p>
   <p>Fiercely the orderly rode down the slope of the corn-field — scarred and forlorn , Rutted by violent wheels , and scathed by the shot that had plowed it in scorn ; Fiercely , and burning with wrath for the sight of his comrades crushed at a blow , Flung in broken shapes on the ground like ruined memorials of woe : These were the men whom at daybreak he knew , but never again could know . Thence to the ridge , where roots outthrust , and twisted branches of trees Clutched the hill like clawing lions , firm their prey to seize .</p>

    <p n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Bride Brook .— The colony of New London ( now part of Connecticut ) was founded by John Winthrop , Jr ., under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts . One of the boundary lines was a stream flowing into Long Island Sound , between the present city of New London and the Connecticut River . In the snowy winter of 1646 , Jonathan Rudd , who dwelt in the settlement of Saybrook Fort , at the mouth of the Connecticut , sent for Winthrop to celebrate a marriage between himself and a certain “ Mary ” of Saybrook , whose last name has been lost . Winthrop performed the ceremony on the frozen surface of the streamlet , the farthest limit of his magistracy ; and thereupon bestowed the name “ Bride Brook , ” which it still bears .</p>
    <p n="2"><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The Bride of War .— Jemima Warner , a Pennsylvania woman , was the wife of one of Morgan 's riflemen . She marched with the expedition ; and , when her husband perished of cold and exhaustion , she took his rifle and equipments and herself carried them to Quebec , where she delivered them to Arnold as a token of her husband 's sacrifice , and proof that he was not a deserter .</p>
    <p n="3">Colonel Enos of Connecticut abandoned the column while it was struggling through the Dead River region , with his whole force , the rear-guard , numbering eight hundred men .
