   <p>To My Husband .</p>
   <p>The following tales , which have no legendary warrant , are supposed to belong to the time , lost in obscurity , immediately subsequent to King Arthur 's death ; when , says Malory , in the closing chapter of LA MORT D'ARTHURE , “ Sir Constantine , which was Sir Cadors son of Cornwaile , was chosen king of England ; and hee was a full noble knight , and worshipfully hee ruled this realme ”</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SANPEUR .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The great King Constantine is at the hunt ;</l>
     <l n="2">The brilliant cavalcade of knights and dames ,</l>
     <l n="3">On palfreys and on chargers trapped in gold</l>
     <l n="4">And silver and red purple , ride in mirth</l>
     <l n="5">Along the winding way , by hill and tarn</l>
     <l n="6">And violet-sprinkled dell . Impatient hounds</l>
     <l n="7">Sniff the keen morning air , and startled birds</l>
     <l n="8">Rustle the foliage redolent with spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">From time to time some courtier reins his steed</l>
     <l n="10">Beside the love-enkindling Gwendolaine ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whose wayward moods do vary as the winds ,—</l>
     <l n="12">Now wooing with her soft , seductive grace ;</l>
     <l n="13">Now fascinating with her stately pride ;</l>
     <l n="14">Anon , bewitching by her recklessness</l>
     <l n="15">Of wilful daring in some wild caprice</l>
     <l n="16">Which no one could anticipate or stay .</l>
     <l n="17">How fair she is to-day ! How beautiful !</l>
     <l n="18">Her hunting-robe is bluer than the sky ,—</l>
     <l n="19">Matching one phase of her great , changeful eyes ,—</l>
     <l n="20">Clasped with twin falcons of unburnished gold ,</l>
     <l n="21">The colour of her brown hair in the sun .</l>
     <l n="22">The white plumes , drooping from her hunting-cap ,</l>
     <l n="23">Leave her alluring lips in tempting sight ,</l>
     <l n="24">But hide the growing shadow in her eyes .</l>
     <l n="25">For she marks none of all the court to-day</l>
     <l n="26">Save Sir Sanpeur , the passing noble knight</l>
     <l n="27">Whose bearing doth bespeak heroic deeds ,</l>
     <l n="28">There where he rides with the sweet maid Ettonne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">Sir Torm , the husband of fair Gwendolaine ,</l>
     <l n="30">Is all unconscious of aught else beside</l>
     <l n="31">The outward seeming , ‘ tis enough for him</l>
     <l n="32">That she is gay and beautiful , and smiles .</l>
     <l n="33">He has a nature small and limited</l>
     <l n="34">By sight , and sense , and self , and his desires ;</l>
     <l n="35">A heart as open as the day to all</l>
     <l n="36">That touches his quick impulse , when it costs</l>
     <l n="37">Him naught of sacrifice . The needy poor</l>
     <l n="38">Flock to his castle for the careless gift</l>
     <l n="39">Of falling dole , but his esquire is faint</l>
     <l n="40">From his exacting service , night and day</l>
     <l n="41">His Lady Gwendolaine is satiate</l>
     <l n="42">With costly gems , palfreys , and samite thick</l>
     <l n="43">With threads of gold and silver , but the sweet</l>
     <l n="44">Heart subtleties and fair observances</l>
     <l n="45">Are lost in the of course of married life .</l>
     <l n="46">He sees , too quickly , does she fail to smile ,</l>
     <l n="47">But never sees the shadow in her eyes</l>
     <l n="48">His hounds are beaten till they scarce draw breath ,</l>
     <l n="49">And then caressed beyond the worth of hounds .</l>
     <l n="50">His vassals know not if , from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="51">He will approve , or strike them with a curse .</l>
     <l n="52">His humours are the byword of the court ,</l>
     <l n="53">And , were it not for his good-heartedness ,</l>
     <l n="54">His prowess , and undaunted strength at arms ,</l>
     <l n="55">Men would speak lightly of him in disdain ;</l>
     <l n="56">He is so often in a stormy rage ,</l>
     <l n="57">Or supplicating humour to atone ,—</l>
     <l n="58">Too petty to repent in very truth ,</l>
     <l n="59">Too light and yielding in repentance , when</l>
     <l n="60">His temper 's force is spent , for dignity</l>
     <l n="61">Of truest knighthood . No one feels his faults</l>
     <l n="62">So quickly , with such flushing of regret</l>
     <l n="63">And shame , as Gwendolaine . But she is wife ,</l>
     <l n="64">His honour is her own , and she would hide</l>
     <l n="65">From all the world , and even from herself ,</l>
     <l n="66">His pettiness and narrowness of soul .</l>
     <l n="67">So she forgets , or doth pretend forget ,</l>
     <l n="68">Where he has failed , save when he passes bounds ;</l>
     <l n="69">Then her swift scorn — a piercing force he dreads —</l>
     <l n="70">Flashes upon him like a probing lance ,</l>
     <l n="71">To silence merriment if it be coarse ,</l>
     <l n="72">To hush his wrath when it is violent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="73">Though powerful to check , she ne'er could change</l>
     <l n="74">The underflow and current of their life .</l>
     <l n="75">In the first years , gone by , ere she had grown</l>
     <l n="76">A woman of the world , she had essayed</l>
     <l n="77">To stem the tide of shallow vanity ,</l>
     <l n="78">To realise her girlhood 's high ideal ,</l>
     <l n="79">And make her home more reverent , and more fine .</l>
     <l n="80">Sir Torm had overborne her words with jest</l>
     <l n="81">And noisy laughter , vowing she would learn</l>
     <l n="82">Romance and sweet simplicity were well</l>
     <l n="83">For harper minstrel , singing in the hall ,</l>
     <l n="84">But not for courtiers living in the world .</l>
     <l n="85">Once , when she faced the thought of motherhood ,—</l>
     <l n="86">For some brief days of sweet expectancy</l>
     <l n="87">Never fulfilled for her ,— she was aware</l>
     <l n="88">Of thirst for living water , and a dread</l>
     <l n="89">Of the light , shallow life she led , fell on her ;</l>
     <l n="90">She went to Torm , and spoke , in broken words ,</l>
     <l n="91">The unformed longing of her dawning soul .</l>
     <l n="92">He lightly laughed , filliped her ear , called her</l>
     <l n="93">“ My Lady Abbess , ” “ pretty saint , ” and then</l>
     <l n="94">Said , later , jesting , before all the court ,</l>
     <l n="95">“ Behold a lady too good for her lord ! ”</l>
     <l n="96">The blood swept up her cheeks to lose itself</l>
     <l n="97">In her hair 's gold , then ebbed again to leave</l>
     <l n="98">Her paler than before . She stood in silent ,</l>
     <l n="99">Momentary hate of Torm , all impotent .</l>
     <l n="100">He saw her pallor and her eyes down-dropt ,</l>
     <l n="101">Came quickly , flung his arm around her , saying ,</l>
     <l n="102">“ God 's faith , my girl , you do not mind a jest !</l>
     <l n="103">Where are the spirits you are wont to have ? ”</l>
     <l n="104">“ My lord , they shall not fail you any more , ”</l>
     <l n="105">She answered bitterly , and after that</l>
     <l n="106">Torm did not see her soul unveiled again .</l>
     <l n="107">Thenceforth she turned her strivings after truth</l>
     <l n="108">To winning outward charm the more complete ,</l>
     <l n="109">And hid her inner self more deeply ‘ neath</l>
     <l n="110">The sparkling surface of her brilliant life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="111">To-day he wearies her with brutal jest</l>
     <l n="112">Upon the hunted boar , and calls her dull</l>
     <l n="113">That she laughs not as ever .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="114">While Sanpeur</l>
     <l n="115">Was far upon a distant quest , all perilous ,</l>
     <l n="116">She thought with secret longing of the hour</l>
     <l n="117">When once again together they should ride .</l>
     <l n="118">He has returned triumphant , having won</l>
     <l n="119">Fresh honours .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="120">Now at last , the hunt has come ,</l>
     <l n="121">The day is golden , and her beauty fair ,—</l>
     <l n="122">And Sir Sanpeur is riding with Ettonne .</l>
     <l n="123">A sudden conflict wages in her heart</l>
     <l n="124">As she talks lightly to each courtier gay ,</l>
     <l n="125">Jealous impatience that the Gwendolaine</l>
     <l n="126">Whom all men flatter , should be thwarted , fights</l>
     <l n="127">A tender yearning to defy all pride</l>
     <l n="128">And call him to her for one spoken word .</l>
     <l n="129">The world seems better when he talks with her ,</l>
     <l n="130">No one has ever lifted her above</l>
     <l n="131">The empty nothings of a courtly life</l>
     <l n="132">As Sir Sanpeur , who makes both life and death</l>
     <l n="133">More grandly solemn , yet more simply clear .</l>
     <l n="134">In a steep curving of the road , he turns</l>
     <l n="135">To meet her smile , which deepens as he comes .</l>
     <l n="136">Sanpeur , bronzed by the eastern sun , is tall ,</l>
     <l n="137">Straight as a javelin , in each noble line</l>
     <l n="138">His knighthood is revealed . Slighter than Torm ,</l>
     <l n="139">Whose strength is in his size , but full as strong ,</l>
     <l n="140">Sanpeur 's unrivalled strength is in his sinew</l>
     <l n="141">His scarlet garb , deep furred with miniver ,</l>
     <l n="142">Is broidered with the cross which leaves untold</l>
     <l n="143">The fame he won in lands of which it tells</l>
     <l n="144">Upon his breast he wears the silver dove ,</l>
     <l n="145">The sacred Order of the Holy Ghost ,</l>
     <l n="146">Which Gwendolaine once noted with the words ,</l>
     <l n="147">“ What famous honours you have won , my lord ! ”</l>
     <l n="148">And he had answered with all knightly grace ,</l>
     <l n="149">“ My Lady Gwendolaine , I seldom think</l>
     <l n="150">Of the high honour , though I greatly prize</l>
     <l n="151">This recognition , far beyond my worth ;</l>
     <l n="152">My thought is ever what it signifieth .</l>
     <l n="153">It is my consecration I belong</l>
     <l n="154">To God the Father , and this is the sign</l>
     <l n="155">Of His most Holy Spirit , sent to us</l>
     <l n="156">By our ascended Saviour , Jesu Christ ,</l>
     <l n="157">By Whom alone I live from day to day . ”</l>
     <l n="158">His quiet words , amid the laughing court ,</l>
     <l n="159">Had startled her , as if a solemn peal</l>
     <l n="160">Of full cathedral music had rung clear</l>
     <l n="161">Above the jousting cry of “ Halt and Ho ! ”</l>
     <l n="162">Then , as she wondered if he were a man</l>
     <l n="163">Like other men , or priest in knightly garb ,</l>
     <l n="164">He spoke of her rich jewels with delight</l>
     <l n="165">And worldly wisdom , telling her the tale</l>
     <l n="166">Of many jewelled mysteries she wore</l>
     <l n="167">“ In the far East , the sapphire stone is held</l>
     <l n="168">To be the talisman for Love and Truth ,</l>
     <l n="169">So is it fitly placed upon your robe ;</l>
     <l n="170">It is the stone of stones to girdle you ”</l>
     <l n="171">“ A man , indeed , ” she thought , “ but not like men . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="172">As on his foam-flecked charger , Carn-Aflang ,</l>
     <l n="173">He rides to-day towards Lady Gwendolaine ,</l>
     <l n="174">She draws her rein more tightly , arching more</l>
     <l n="175">Her palfrey 's head , and all unconsciously</l>
     <l n="176">Uplifts her own ,— for she has waited long .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="177">“ Good morrow , my fair Lady Gwendolaine . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="178">“ Good morrow , Sir Sanpeur , pray do you mark</l>
     <l n="179">My new gerfalcon , from beyond the sea ?</l>
     <l n="180">Your eyes are just the colour of her wings . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="181">“ Now , by my troth , I challenge any knight</l>
     <l n="182">To say precisely what that colour is . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="183">“ ‘ Tis there the likeness serves so well , Sanpeur . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="184">“ My Lady Gwendoline , your speech is , far</l>
     <l n="185">Beyond your purpose , gracious , for right well</l>
     <l n="186">I mind me that you told me , once , your heart</l>
     <l n="187">Often rebelled against the well-defined ,</l>
     <l n="188">And I should be content to have my eyes</l>
     <l n="189">The motley colour of your falcon 's plume ,</l>
     <l n="190">Lest they make you rebel . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="191">“ Ah , Sir Sanpeur ,</l>
     <l n="192">Your memory is far too steadfast ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="193">“ Naught</l>
     <l n="194">Can be too steadfast for your grace , fair dame . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="195">Now he has come , the wayward Gwendolaine</l>
     <l n="196">Is fain to punish him for his delay .</l>
     <l n="197">“ Methinks , ” she says , in pique , against her will ,</l>
     <l n="198">“ The beautiful Ettonne looks for her knight ;</l>
     <l n="199">It scarce seems chivalrous to leave her thus . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="200">“ ‘ Tis true , my lady , I came not to stay ,</l>
     <l n="201">But for a greeting , which I now have said . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="202">He left her , the light shadow darker grew</l>
     <l n="203">Within her eyes , and golden hawking bells</l>
     <l n="204">Upon her jesses clashed with sudden clink ,</l>
     <l n="205">As her fair hand had closed impatiently .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="206">Betimes came Constantine , who looked a man</l>
     <l n="207">Of hard-won conquests , not the least , o'er self .</l>
     <l n="208">Before his stately presence Gwendolaine</l>
     <l n="209">Bowed low with heartfelt loyalty .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="210">“ My King ,</l>
     <l n="211">Care rides beside you , banish him , to-day ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="213">“ Alas ! he is the Sovereign of the King ,</l>
     <l n="214">And stays , defying all command , fair Gwendolaine . ”</l>
     <l n="215">Then , smiling grimly ,— “ My great heritage ,</l>
     <l n="216">As heir to fragments of the Table Round ,</l>
     <l n="217">Brings me no wealth of ease . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="218">In converse light</l>
     <l n="219">They rode together . When the hunt was done ,</l>
     <l n="220">The King , all courteous , said , “ My gracious dame ,</l>
     <l n="221">Well have you learned of nature her great laws ;</l>
     <l n="222">The sun , that warms with its intensity</l>
     <l n="223">The earth to fruitage , is the same that throws</l>

     <l n="225">And you , who meet my purposes of state</l>

     <l n="229">Forget their weight . Gramercy for your grace !</l>
     <l n="230">It has revived me as a summer shower</l>
     <l n="231">Revives the parched and under-trodden grass ;</l>
     <l n="232">It is but seldom I have time to seek</l>
     <l n="233">Refreshment , save of labour changed . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="234">“ My King , ” —</l>
     <l n="235">She passed from gay to grave ,— “ my own heart aches</l>
     <l n="236">With life 's vexed questions , and its stern demands ,</l>
     <l n="237">Full often even in my sheltered state ;</l>
     <l n="238">And you , my liege , must be well-nigh o'ercome</l>
     <l n="239">With the vast load of duties you fulfil</l>
     <l n="240">So nobly , to the glory of the realm .</l>
     <l n="241">Would I could serve you , as you well deserve ;</l>
     <l n="242">But I am only woman , so I smile</l>
     <l n="243">In lieu of fighting for you , as I would</l>
     <l n="244">Unto the death , if I were but a knight . ”</l>
