IN MEMORIAM PALESTINE , ‘ 19 Do you remember one immortal Lost moment out of time and space , What time we thought , who passed the portal Of that divine disastrous place Where Life was slain and Truth was slandered On that one holier hill than Rome , How far abroad our bodies wandered That evening when our souls came home ? The mystic city many-gated , With monstrous columns , was your own : Herodian stones fell down and waited Two thousand years to be your throne . In the grey rocks the burning blossom Glowed terrible as the sacred blood : It was no stranger to your bosom Than bluebells of an English wood . Do you remember a road that follows The way of unforgotten feet , Where from the waste of rocks and hollows Climb up the crawling crooked street The stages of one towering drama Always ahead and out of sight ... Do you remember Aceldama And the jackal barking in the night ? Life is not void or stuff for scorners : We have laughed loud and kept our love , We have heard singers in tavern corners And not forgotten the birds above : We have known smiters and sons of thunder And not unworthily walked with them , We have grown wiser and lost not wonder ; And we have seen Jerusalem .</docImprint>

     <head>THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA</head>
     <p>( St. Barbara is the patron saint of artillery and of those in danger of sudden death . )</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">When the long grey lines came flooding upon Paris in the plain ,</l>
       <l n="2">We stood and drank of the last free air we never could taste again :</l>
       <l n="3">They had led us back from the lost battle , to halt we knew not where</l>
       <l n="4">And stilled us ; and our gaping guns were dumb with our despair .</l>
       <l n="5">The grey tribes flowed for ever from the infinite lifeless lands</l>
       <l n="6">And a Norman to a Breton spoke , his chin upon his hands .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">“ There was an end to Ilium ; and an end came to Rome ;</l>
       <l n="8">And a man plays on a painted stage in the land that he calls home ;</l>
       <l n="9">Arch after arch of triumph , but floor beyond falling floor ,</l>
       <l n="10">That lead to a low door at last ; and beyond there is no door . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">And the Breton to the Norman spoke , like a small child spoke he ,</l>
       <l n="12">And his sea-blue eyes were empty as his home beside the sea :</l>
       <l n="13">“ There are more windows in one house than there are eyes to see ,</l>
       <l n="14">There are more doors in a man 's house , but God has hid the key :</l>
       <l n="15">Ruin is a builder of windows ; her legend witnesseth</l>
       <l n="16">Barbara , the saint of gunners , and a stay in sudden death . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="17">It seemed the wheel of the world stood still an instant in its turning ,</l>
       <l n="18">More than the kings of the earth that turned with the turning of Valmy</l>
       <l n="19">mill :</l>
       <l n="20">While trickled the idle tale and the sea-blue eyes were burning ,</l>
       <l n="21">Still as the heart of a whirlwind the heart of the world stood still .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="22">“ Barbara the beautiful</l>
       <l n="23">Had praise of lute and pen :</l>
       <l n="24">Her hair was like a summer night</l>
       <l n="25">Dark and desired of men .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Her feet like birds from far away</l>
       <l n="27">That linger and light in doubt ;</l>
       <l n="28">And her face was like a window</l>
       <l n="29">Where a man 's first love looked out .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="30">Her sire was master of many slaves</l>
       <l n="31">A hard man of his hands ;</l>
       <l n="32">They built a tower about her</l>
       <l n="33">In the desolate golden lands ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="34">Sealed as the tyrants sealed their tombs ,</l>
       <l n="35">Planned with an ancient plan ,</l>
       <l n="36">And set two windows in the tower</l>
       <l n="37">Like the two eyes of a man . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="38">Our guns were set toward the foe ; we had no word , for firing .</l>
       <l n="39">Grey in the gateway of St. Gond the Guard of the tyrant shone ;</l>
       <l n="40">Dark with the fate of a falling star , retiring and retiring ,</l>
       <l n="41">The Breton line went backward and the Breton tale went on .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="42">“ Her father had sailed across the sea</l>
       <l n="43">From the harbour of Africa</l>
       <l n="44">When all the slaves took up their tools</l>
       <l n="45">For the bidding of Barbara .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="46">She smote the bare wall with her hand</l>
       <l n="47">And bad them smite again ;</l>
       <l n="48">She poured them wealth of wine and meat</l>
       <l n="49">To stay them in their pain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="50">And cried through the lifted thunder</l>
       <l n="51">Of thronging hammer and hod</l>
       <l n="52">‘ Throw open the third window</l>
       <l n="53">In the third name of God . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="54">Then the hearts failed and the tools fell ,</l>
       <l n="55">And far towards the foam ,</l>
       <l n="56">Men saw a shadow on the sands</l>
       <l n="57">And her father coming home . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="58">Speak low and low , along the line the whispered word is flying</l>
       <l n="59">Before the touch , before the time , we may not loose a breath :</l>
       <l n="60">Their guns must mash us to the mire and there be no replying ,</l>
       <l n="61">Till the hand is raised to fling us for the final dice to death .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="62">“ There were two windows in your tower ,</l>
       <l n="63">Barbara , Barbara ,</l>
       <l n="64">For all between the sun and moon</l>
       <l n="65">In the lands of Africa .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="66">Hath a man three eyes , Barbara ,</l>
       <l n="67">A bird three wings ,</l>
       <l n="68">That you have riven roof and wall</l>
       <l n="69">To look upon vain things ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="70">Her voice was like a wandering thing</l>
       <l n="71">That falters yet is free ,</l>
       <l n="72">Whose soul has drunk in a distant land</l>
       <l n="73">Of the rivers of liberty .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="74">“ There are more wings than the wind knows</l>
       <l n="75">Or eyes than see the sun</l>
       <l n="76">In the light of the lost window</l>
       <l n="77">And the wind of the doors undone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="78">For out of the first lattice</l>
       <l n="79">Are the red lands that break</l>
       <l n="80">And out of the second lattice</l>
       <l n="81">Sea like a green snake ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="82">But out of the third lattice</l>
       <l n="83">Under low eaves like wings</l>
       <l n="84">Is a new corner of the sky</l>
       <l n="85">And the other side of things . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="86">It opened in the inmost place an instant beyond uttering ,</l>
       <l n="87">A casement and a chasm and a thunder of doors undone ,</l>
       <l n="88">A seraph 's strong wing shaken out the shock of its unshuttering ,</l>
       <l n="89">That split the shattered sunlight from a light behind the sun .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="90">“ Then he drew sword and drave her</l>
       <l n="91">Where the judges sat and said</l>
       <l n="92">‘ Caesar sits above the gods ,</l>
       <l n="93">Barbara the maid .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="94">Caesar hath made a treaty</l>
       <l n="95">With the moon and with the sun ,</l>
       <l n="96">All the gods that men can praise</l>
       <l n="97">Praise him every one .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="24">
       <l n="98">There is peace with the anointed</l>
       <l n="99">Of the scarlet oils of Bel ,</l>
       <l n="100">With the Fish God , where the whirlpool</l>
       <l n="101">Is a winding stair to hell ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="25">
       <l n="102">With the pathless pyramids of slime ,</l>

       <l n="105">Abominable gifts ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="26">
       <l n="106">With the leprous silver cities</l>
       <l n="107">Where the dumb priests dance and nod ,</l>
