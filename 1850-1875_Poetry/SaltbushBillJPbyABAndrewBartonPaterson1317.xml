       <l n="14">Weary with waiting and hope deferred</l>
       <l n="15">They were ready to own defeat ,</l>

       <l n="1">Brumby 's Run</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Brumby is the Aboriginal word for a wild horse . At a recent trial a N. S. W . Supreme Court Judge , hearing of Brumby horses , asked : “ Who is Brumby , and where is his Run ? ”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It lies beyond the Western Pines</l>
       <l n="2">Towards the sinking sun ,</l>
       <l n="3">And not a survey mark defines</l>
       <l n="4">The bounds of “ Brumby 's Run ” .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">On odds and ends of mountain land ,</l>
       <l n="6">On tracks of range and rock</l>
       <l n="7">Where no one else can make a stand ,</l>
       <l n="8">Old Brumby rears his stock .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">A wild , unhandled lot they are</l>
       <l n="10">Of every shape and breed .</l>
       <l n="11">They venture out ‘ neath moon and star</l>
       <l n="12">Along the flats to feed ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">But when the dawn makes pink the sky</l>
       <l n="14">And steals along the plain ,</l>
       <l n="15">The Brumby horses turn and fly</l>
       <l n="16">Towards the hills again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">The traveller by the mountain-track</l>
       <l n="18">May hear their hoof-beats pass ,</l>
       <l n="19">And catch a glimpse of brown and black</l>
       <l n="20">Dim shadows on the grass .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">The eager stockhorse pricks his ears</l>
       <l n="22">And lifts his head on high</l>
       <l n="23">In wild excitement when he hears</l>
       <l n="24">The Brumby mob go by .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">Old Brumby asks no price or fee</l>
       <l n="26">O'er all his wide domains :</l>
       <l n="27">The man who yards his stock is free</l>
       <l n="28">To keep them for his pains .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">So , off to scour the mountain-side</l>
       <l n="30">With eager eyes aglow ,</l>
       <l n="31">To strongholds where the wild mobs hide</l>
       <l n="32">The gully-rakers go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">A rush of horses through the trees ,</l>
       <l n="34">A red shirt making play ;</l>
       <l n="35">A sound of stockwhips on the breeze ,</l>
       <l n="36">They vanish far away !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">

       <l n="38">Ah , me ! before our day is done</l>
       <l n="39">We long with bitter pain</l>
       <l n="40">To ride once more on Brumby 's Run</l>

       <l n="1">Saltbush Bill on the Patriarchs</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Come all you little rouseabouts and climb upon my knee ;</l>
       <l n="3">To-day , you see , is Christmas Day , and so it 's up to me</l>
       <l n="4">To give you some instruction like — a kind of Christmas tale —</l>
       <l n="5">So name your yarn , and off she goes . What , “ Jonah and the Whale ” ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">Well , whales is sheep I 've never shore ; I 've never been to sea ,</l>
       <l n="7">So all them great Leviathans is mysteries to me ;</l>
       <l n="8">But there 's a tale the Bible tells I fully understand ,</l>
       <l n="9">About the time the Patriarchs were settling on the land .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Those Patriarchs of olden time , when all is said and done ,</l>
       <l n="11">They lived the same as far-out men on many a Queensland run —</l>
       <l n="12">A lot of roving , droving men who drifted to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="13">The same we did out Queensland way a score of years ago .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">Now Isaac was a squatter man , and Jacob was his son ,</l>
       <l n="15">And when the boy grew up , you see , he wearied of the run .</l>
       <l n="16">You know the way that boys grow up — there 's some that stick at home ;</l>
       <l n="17">But any boy that 's worth his salt will roll his swag and roam .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">So Jacob caught the roving fit and took the drovers ’ track</l>
       <l n="19">To where his uncle had a run , beyond the outer back ;</l>
       <l n="20">You see they made for out-back runs for room to stretch and grow ,</l>
       <l n="21">The same we did out Queensland way , a score of years ago .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">Now , Jacob knew the ways of stock — that 's most uncommon clear —</l>
       <l n="23">For when he got to Laban 's Run , they made him overseer ;</l>
       <l n="24">He did n't ask a pound a week , but bargained for his pay</l>
       <l n="25">To take the roan and strawberry calves — the same we 'd take to-day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="26">The duns and blacks and “ Goulburn roans ” ( that 's brindles ) , coarse and hard ,</l>
       <l n="27">He branded them with Laban 's brand , in Old Man Laban 's yard ;</l>
       <l n="28">So , when he 'd done the station work for close on seven year ,</l>
       <l n="29">Why , all the choicest stock belonged to Laban 's overseer .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="30">It 's often so with overseers — I 've seen the same thing done</l>
       <l n="31">By many a Queensland overseer on many a Queensland run .</l>
       <l n="32">But when the mustering time came on old Laban acted straight ,</l>
       <l n="33">And gave him country of his own outside the boundary gate .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="34">He gave him stock , and offered him his daughter 's hand in troth ;</l>
       <l n="35">And Jacob first he married one , and then he married both ;</l>
       <l n="36">You see , they were n't particular about a wife or so —</l>
       <l n="37">No more were we up Queensland way a score of years ago .</l>

       <l n="2">My son , if you go to the races to battle with Ikey and Mo ,</l>
       <l n="3">Remember , it 's seldom the pigeon can pick out the eye of the crow ;</l>
       <l n="4">Remember , they live by the business ; remember , my son , and go slow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">If ever an owner should tell you , “ Back mine ” — do n't you be such a flat .</l>
       <l n="6">He knows his own cunning , no doubt — does he know what the others are at ?</l>
       <l n="7">Find out what he 's frightened of most , and invest a few dollars on that .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Walk not in the track of the trainer , nor hang round the rails at his stall . His wisdom belongs to his patron — shall he give it to one and to all ? When the stable is served he may tell you — and his words are like jewels let fall .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Run wide of the tipster who whispers that Borak is sure to be first ,</l>
       <l n="2">He tells the next mug that he corners a tale with the placings reversed ;</l>
       <l n="3">And , remember , of judges of racing , the jockey 's the absolute worst .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>When they lay three to one on the field , and the runners are twenty-and-two , Take a pull on yourself ; take a pull — it 's a mighty big field to get through . Is the club handicapper a fool ? If a fool is about , p'raps it 's you !</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Beware of the critic who tells you the handicap 's absolute rot ,</l>
       <l n="2">For this is chucked in , and that 's hopeless , and somebody ought to be shot .</l>

       <l n="4">From tipsters , and jockeys , and trials , and gallops , the glory has gone ,</l>

       <l n="1">An Answer to Various Bards</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Well , I 've waited mighty patient while they all came rolling in ,</l>
       <l n="3">Mister Lawson , Mister Dyson , and the others of their kin ,</l>
       <l n="4">With their dreadful , dismal stories of the Overlander 's camp ,</l>
       <l n="5">How his fire is always smoky , and his boots are always damp ;</l>
       <l n="6">And they paint it so terrific it would fill one 's soul with gloom ,</l>
       <l n="7">But you know they 're fond of writing about “ corpses ” and “ the tomb ” .</l>
       <l n="8">So , before they curse the bushland they should let their fancy range ,</l>
       <l n="9">And take something for their livers , and be cheerful for a change .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">Now , for instance , Mr. Lawson — well , of course , we almost cried</l>
       <l n="11">At the sorrowful description how his “ little ‘ Arvie ” died ,</l>
       <l n="12">And we lachrymosed in silence when “ His Father 's Mate ” was slain ;</l>
       <l n="13">Then he went and killed the father , and we had to weep again .</l>
       <l n="14">Ben Duggan and Jack Denver , too , he caused them to expire ,</l>
       <l n="15">And he went and cooked the gander of Jack Dunn , of Nevertire ;</l>
       <l n="16">So , no doubt , the bush is wretched if you judge it by the groan</l>
       <l n="17">Of the sad and soulful poet with a graveyard of his own .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">And he spoke in terms prophetic of a revolution 's heat ,</l>
       <l n="19">When the world should hear the clamour of those people in the street ;</l>
       <l n="20">But the shearer chaps who start it — why , he rounds on them in blame ,</l>
       <l n="21">And he calls ‘ em “ agitators ” who are living on the game .</l>
       <l n="22">But I “ over-write ” the bushmen ! Well , I own without a doubt</l>
       <l n="23">That I always see a hero in the “ man from furthest out ” .</l>
       <l n="24">I could never contemplate him through an atmosphere of gloom ,</l>
       <l n="25">And a bushman never struck me as a subject for “ the tomb ” .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="26">If it ai n't all “ golden sunshine ” where the “ wattle branches wave ” ,</l>
       <l n="27">Well , it ai n't all damp and dismal , and it ai n't all “ lonely grave ” .</l>
       <l n="28">And , of course , there 's no denying that the bushman 's life is rough ,</l>
       <l n="29">But a man can easy stand it if he 's built of sterling stuff ;</l>
       <l n="30">Tho ’ it 's seldom that the drover gets a bed of eider-down ,</l>
       <l n="31">Yet the man who 's born a bushman , he gets mighty sick of town ,</l>
       <l n="32">For he 's jotting down the figures , and he 's adding up the bills</l>
       <l n="33">While his heart is simply aching for a sight of Southern hills .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="34">Then he hears a wool-team passing with a rumble and a lurch ,</l>
       <l n="35">And , although the work is pressing , yet it brings him off his perch .</l>
       <l n="36">For it stirs him like a message from his station friends afar</l>
       <l n="37">And he seems to sniff the ranges in the scent of wool and tar ;</l>
       <l n="38">And it takes him back in fancy , half in laughter , half in tears ,</l>
       <l n="39">To a sound of other voices and a thought of other years ,</l>
       <l n="40">When the woolshed rang with bustle from the dawning of the day ,</l>
       <l n="41">And the shear-blades were a-clicking to the cry of “ Wool away ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="42">Then his face was somewhat browner and his frame was firmer set —</l>
       <l n="43">And he feels his flabby muscles with a feeling of regret .</l>
       <l n="44">But the wool-team slowly passes , and his eyes go sadly back</l>
       <l n="45">To the dusty little table and the papers in the rack ,</l>
       <l n="46">And his thoughts go to the terrace where his sickly children squall ,</l>
       <l n="47">And he thinks there 's something healthy in the bush-life after all .</l>
       <l n="48">But we 'll go no more a-droving in the wind or in the sun ,</l>
       <l n="49">For our fathers ’ hearts have failed us and the droving days are done .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="50">There 's a nasty dash of danger where the long-horned bullock wheels ,</l>
       <l n="51">And we like to live in comfort and to get our reg'lar meals .</l>
       <l n="52">For to hang around the townships suits us better , you 'll agree ,</l>
       <l n="53">And a job at washing bottles is the job for such as we .</l>
       <l n="54">Let us herd into the cities , let us crush and crowd and push</l>
       <l n="55">Till we lose the love of roving and we learn to hate the bush ;</l>
       <l n="56">And we 'll turn our aspirations to a city life and beer ,</l>
       <l n="57">And we 'll slip across to England — it 's a nicer place than here ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="58">For there 's not much risk of hardship where all comforts are in store ,</l>
       <l n="59">And the theatres are plenty and the pubs are more and more .</l>
       <l n="60">But that ends it , Mr. Lawson , and it 's time to say good-bye ,</l>
       <l n="61">We must agree to differ in all friendship , you and I ;</l>
       <l n="62">So we 'll work our own salvation with the stoutest hearts we may ,</l>
       <l n="63">And if fortune only favours we will take the road some day ,</l>
       <l n="64">And go droving down the river ‘ neath the sunshine and the stars ,</l>
       <l n="65">And then return to Sydney and vermilionize the bars .</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">It was over at Coolgardie that a mining speculator ,</l>
       <l n="3">Who was going down the township just to make a bit o ’ chink ,</l>
       <l n="4">Went off to hire a camel from a camel propagator ,</l>
       <l n="5">And the Afghan said he 'd lend it if he 'd stand the beast a drink .</l>
       <l n="6">Yes , the only price he asked him was to stand the beast a drink .</l>
       <l n="7">He was cheap , very cheap , as the dromedaries go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">So the mining speculator made the bargain , proudly thinking</l>
       <l n="9">He had bested old Mahomet , he had done him in the eye .</l>
       <l n="10">Then he clambered on the camel , and the while the beast was drinking</l>
       <l n="11">He explained with satisfaction to the miners standing by</l>
       <l n="12">That ‘ twas cheap , very cheap , as the dromedaries go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">But the camel kept on drinking and he filled his hold with water ,</l>
       <l n="14">And the more he had inside him yet the more he seemed to need ;</l>
       <l n="15">For he drank it by the gallon , and his girths grew taut and tauter ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the miners muttered softly , “ Yes , he 's very dry indeed !</l>
       <l n="17">But he 's cheap , very cheap , as the dromedaries go . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="18">So he drank up twenty buckets — it was weird to watch him suck it ,</l>
       <l n="19">( And the market price for water was per bucket half-a-crown )</l>
       <l n="20">Till the speculator stopped him , saying , “ Not another bucket —</l>
       <l n="21">If I give him any more there 'll be a famine in the town .</l>
       <l n="22">Take him back to old Mahomet , and I 'll tramp it through the town . ”</l>
       <l n="23">He was cheap , very cheap , as the speculators go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="24">There 's a moral to this story — in your hat you ought to paste it ,</l>
       <l n="25">Be careful whom you shout for when a camel is about ,</l>
       <l n="26">And there 's plenty human camels who , before they 'll see you waste it ,</l>
       <l n="27">Will drink up all you pay for if you 're fool enough to shout ;</l>
       <l n="28">If you chance to strike a camel when you 're fool enough to shout ,</l>

       <l n="62">The race put her owner right clear of his debts ,</l>

       <l n="8">When every jump means all you know to keep him on his feet ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="9">When any slip means sudden death — with wife and child to keep —</l>
       <l n="10">It needs some nerve to draw the whip and flog him at the leap —</l>

       <l n="12">He never flinched at fence or wall , he never was afraid ;</l>
       <l n="13">With easy seat and nerve of steel , light hand and smiling face ,</l>
       <l n="14">He held the rushing horses back , and made the sluggards race .</l>

       <l n="15">He gave the shirkers extra heart , he steadied down the rash ,</l>

       <l n="17">He got the rushing Wymlet home that never jumped at all —</l>

       <l n="21">They were , indeed , a glorious pair — the great upstanding horse ,</l>

       <l n="23">Though weight was big and pace was hot and fences stiff and tall ,</l>
       <l n="24">“ You follow Tommy Corrigan ” was passed to one and all .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="27">But now we 'll keep his memory green while horsemen come and go ,</l>
       <l n="28">We may not see his like again where silks and satins glow .</l>
       <l n="29">We 'll drink to him in silence , boys — he 's followed down the track</l>
       <l n="30">Where many a good man went before , but never one came back .</l>
       <l n="31">And let us hope in that far land where shades of brave men reign ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Now , this is just a simple tale to tell the reader how</l>
       <l n="3">They civilised the Maori tribe at Rooti-iti-au .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">. . . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="5">The Maoris are a mighty race — the finest ever known ;</l>
       <l n="6">Before the missionaries came they worshipped wood and stone ;</l>
       <l n="7">They went to war and fought like fiends , and when the war was done</l>
       <l n="8">They pacified their conquered foes by eating every one .</l>
       <l n="9">But now-a-days about the pahs in idleness they lurk ,</l>
       <l n="10">Prepared to smoke or drink or talk — or anything but work .</l>
       <l n="11">The richest tribe in all the North in sheep and horse and cow</l>
       <l n="12">Were those who led their simple lives at Rooti-iti-au .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="13">‘ Twas down to town at Wellington a noble Maori came ,</l>
       <l n="14">A Rangatira of the best , Rerenga was his name —</l>
       <l n="15">( The word Rerenga means a “ snag ” — but until he was gone</l>
       <l n="16">This did n't strike the folk he met — it struck them later on ) .</l>
       <l n="17">He stalked into the Bank they call the “ Great Financial Hell ” ,</l>
       <l n="18">And told the Chief Financial Fiend the tribe had wool to sell .</l>
       <l n="19">The Bold Bank Manager looked grave — the price of wool was high .</l>
       <l n="20">He said , “ We 'll lend you what you need — we 're not disposed to buy .</l>
       <l n="21">You ship the wool to England , Chief !— You 'll find it 's good advice ,</l>
       <l n="22">And meanwhile you can draw from us the local market price . ”</l>
       <l n="23">The Chief he thanked him courteously and said he wished to state</l>
       <l n="24">In all the Rooti-iti tribe his mana would be great ,</l>
       <l n="25">But still the tribe were simple folk , and did not understand</l>
       <l n="26">This strange finance that gave them cash without the wool in hand .</l>
       <l n="27">So off he started home again , with trouble on his brow ,</l>
       <l n="28">To lay the case before the tribe at Rooti-iti-au .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="29">They held a great korero in the Rooti-iti clan ,</l>
       <l n="30">With speeches lasting half a day from every leading man .</l>
       <l n="31">They called themselves poetic names — “ lost children in a wood ” ;</l>
       <l n="32">They said the Great Bank Manager was Kapai — extra good !</l>
       <l n="33">And so they sent Rerenga down , full-powered and well-equipped ,</l>
       <l n="34">To draw as much as he could get , and let the wool be shipped ;</l>
       <l n="35">And wedged into a “ Cargo Tank ” , full up from stern to bow ,</l>
       <l n="36">A mighty clip of wool went Home from Rooti-iti-au .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">It was the Bold Bank Manager who drew a heavy cheque ;</l>
       <l n="38">Rerenga cashed it thoughtfully , then clasped him round the neck ;</l>
       <l n="39">A hug from him was not at all a thing you 'd call a lark —</l>
       <l n="40">You see he lived on mutton-birds and dried remains of shark —</l>
       <l n="41">But still it showed his gratitude , and , as he pouched the pelf ,</l>
       <l n="42">“ I 'll haka for you , sir , ” he said , “ in honour of yourself ! ”</l>
       <l n="43">The haka is a striking dance — the sort they do n't allow</l>
       <l n="44">In any place more civilised than Rooti-iti-au .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="45">He “ haka 'd ” most effectively — then , with an airy grace</l>
       <l n="46">Rubbed noses with the Manager , and vanished into space .</l>
       <l n="47">But when the wool-return came back , ah me , what sighs and groans !</l>
       <l n="48">For every bale of Maori wool was loaded up with stones !</l>
       <l n="49">Yes — thumping great New Zealand rocks among the wool they found ;</l>
       <l n="50">On every rock the Bank had lent just seven pence a pound .</l>
       <l n="51">And now the Bold Bank Manager , with trouble on his brow ,</l>
       <l n="52">Is searching vainly for the chief from Rooti-iti-au .</l>
