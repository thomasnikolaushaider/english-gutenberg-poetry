     <l n="3">The wine is spilled , the altar violate ;</l>

     <l n="5">Its joys that could not last ,</l>
     <l n="6">Its flowers that had to fade ,</l>
     <l n="7">Its bliss so long delayed ,</l>
     <l n="8">Its sun so soon o'ercast ,</l>
     <l n="9">Its faith so soon betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="10">Its prayers so madly prayed ,</l>
     <l n="11">Its wildly-fought-for right ,</l>
     <l n="12">Its dear renounced delight ,</l>
     <l n="13">Its passions and its pain —</l>
     <l n="14">All these stand gray about</l>
     <l n="15">My bed , like ghosts from Paradise shut out ,</l>

     <l n="19">Not one of these but life has fouled its name ,</l>
     <l n="20">Blotted it out with sin and loss and shame —</l>

     <l n="26">Through the last bitterness of the last vain tear ,</l>
     <l n="27">One saw a face —</l>
     <l n="28">Human — not turned away from man 's disgrace —</l>
     <l n="29">A face divinely dear —</l>
     <l n="30">A head that had a crown of thorns to wear ;</l>
     <l n="31">If there should come a hand</l>
     <l n="32">Drawing this tired head to a place of rest</l>
     <l n="33">On a most loving breast ;</l>
     <l n="34">And as one felt that one could almost bear</l>
     <l n="35">To tell the whole long sickening trivial tale</l>
     <l n="36">Of how one came so utterly to fail</l>
     <l n="37">Of all one once knew that one might attain —</l>
     <l n="38">If one should feel consoling arms about ,</l>
     <l n="39">Shutting one in , shutting the black past out —</l>
     <l n="40">Should feel the tears that washed one clean again ,</l>
     <l n="41">And turn , made dumb with love and shame , to hear :</l>

     <l n="19">They set in hand at once to yield their suppliant ,</l>
     <l n="20">But Aristodicus , loved of the city ,</l>
     <l n="21">Withstood their will ,— and thus to them spake he .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">“ Your messengers have lied — they have made merry</l>
     <l n="23">In their own homes , they have not sought Apollo ;</l>
     <l n="24">The god in Branch [) i ] dae had never counselled</l>
     <l n="25">That we should yield our suppliant to the foe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">“ Wait . I , myself , with others of your choosing ,</l>
     <l n="27">Will seek the god , and bring you back his answer ,</l>
     <l n="28">I would not yield the man who trusted Cyme —</l>
     <l n="29">What — is the god of baser stuff than I ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">So , by the bright bay , under the blue heavens ,</l>
     <l n="31">A second time to Branch [) i ] dae they journeyed ,</l>
     <l n="32">A second time beneath the purple shadows</l>
     <l n="33">Passed through the laurels to Apollo 's fane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">Then Aristodicus spake thus : “ To Cyme</l>
     <l n="35">Comes Pactyes fleeing from the wrath of Persia —</l>
     <l n="36">And she demands him , but we dare not yield him ,</l>
     <l n="37">Until we know what thou wouldst have us do .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">“ Our arm is weak against the power of Persia ,</l>
     <l n="39">The foe is strong , and our defences slender ;</l>
     <l n="40">Yet , Lord , not yet have we been bold to render</l>
     <l n="41">Him who has come , a suppliant , to our gates . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="42">So the Cymean spake . Apollo answered :</l>
     <l n="43">“ Yield ye your suppliant — yield him to the Persians ” .</l>
     <l n="44">Then Aristodicus bethought him further ,</l>
     <l n="45">And in this fashion craftily he wrought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">All round the temple , in the nooks and crannies</l>
     <l n="47">Of carven work made by man 's love and labour ,</l>
     <l n="48">In perfect safety , by Apollo guarded ,</l>
     <l n="49">The swallows and the sparrows built their nests .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">And all day long their floating wings made beauty</l>
     <l n="51">About the temple and the whispering laurels ,</l>

     <l n="54">Now round the temple went the men of Cyme ,</l>

     <l n="56">And a wild wind went moaning through the branches .</l>
     <l n="57">The sunlight died , and all the sky grew gray .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="58">Men shivered in the disenchanted noontide ,</l>

     <l n="61">The anger of the immortal gods made night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="62">Then from the hid shrine of the inner temple</l>
     <l n="63">Came forth a voice more beautiful than music ,</l>
     <l n="64">More terrible than thunder and wild waters ,</l>
     <l n="65">And more to be desired than summer sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="66">“ O thou most impious of all impious mortals ,</l>

     <l n="68">And torn away the homes of those who trust me ,</l>
     <l n="69">Taken my suppliants from me for thy prey ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="70">Then Aristodicus stood forth , and answered :</l>

     <l n="73">To yield their suppliant to the Persian spears ? ”</l>

     <l n="74">Then on the hush of awful expectation</l>
     <l n="75">Following the challenge of the too-bold mortals ,</l>
     <l n="76">Broke the god 's voice , unspeakably melodious</l>
     <l n="77">With all the song and sorrow of the world :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="78">“ Yea , I do bid you yield him , that so sinning</l>
     <l n="79">Against the gods ye may the sooner perish —</l>
     <l n="80">And come no more to question at my temple</l>
     <l n="81">Of yielding suppliants who have trusted you ! ”</l>

    <head>RUCKINGE CHURCH .</head>
    <head>“ And we said how dreary and desolate and forlorn the church was , and how long it was since any music but that of the moth-eaten harmonium and the heartless mixed choir had sounded there . And we said : ‘ Poor old church ! it will never hear any true music any more ’ . Then she turned to us from the door of the Lady Chapel , which was plastered and whitewashed , and had a stove and the Evangelical Almanac in it , and her eyes were full of tears . And , standing there , she sang ‘ Ave Maria ’ — it was Gounod 's music , I think — with her voice and her face like an angel 's . And while she sang a stranger came to the church door and stood listening , but he did not see us . Only we saw that he loved her singing . And he went away as soon as the hymn was ended , we also soon following , and the church was left lonely as before . ” — Extract from our Diary .</head>
