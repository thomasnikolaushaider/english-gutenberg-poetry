    <head>NOTES ON THE BIRTH OF THE LARK</head>
    <head>Boston Herald .— “ The pictures and rhymes in The Lark rank with the most remarkable things done for children since the days of Mother Goose . ”</head>
    <head>Boston Budget .— “ The Lark is a reaction against the decadent spirit . It is blithe , happy , full of the joy of life and the Greek within us — a herald of the dawn of the new century . ”</head>
     <l n="1">Boston Commonwealth .— “ Everything in The Lark is clever — some , we</l>
     <l n="2">may be permitted to add , cleverer than the rest . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>New York Critic .— “ The faddists have produced some extraordinary things in the way of literature , but nothing more freakish has made its appearance in the last half-century than The Lark . ”</p>
   <p>New York Tribune .— “ It is perhaps one-fourth a monthly periodical and three-fourths an escapade . The Lark ought really to be called ‘ The Goose . ’ ”</p>
   <p>New York Herald .— “ The current number of The Lark is , if possible , more curious , more quaint , more preposterously humorous , and more original than its predecessors . It is entirely unlike any other publication . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Richmond Times .— “ We do not understand upon what the editor of</l>
     <l n="2">The Lark bases anticipation of interest and consequent demand . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Philadelphia Times .— “ The young men who publish The Lark have ideas of their own . The Lark is smart and funny in a way quite its own , and it is also capable of serious flights and of musical notes clear enough to be heard across the continent . ”</p>
   <p>Cincinnati Commercial Gazette .— “ The worst thing about it being that it is all too brief . ”</p>
   <p>Jersey City Chronicle .— “ Every line in it is well worth perusal . ”</p>
   <p>St. Paul Globe .— “ The Lark partakes of the prevalent temper of life on the Pacific Coast , where the don'thYpppHeNcare mood of the West takes an especially sunny and cheerful turn , and life looks a bigger joke than elsewhere in the Union . ”</p>
   <p>St. Louis Mirror .— “ The Lark continues to be odd and ridiculous . Its humor is quite unlike any other humor ever seen in this country . There are good men with good pens working on The Lark . ”</p>
   <p>Kansas City Star .— “ The Lark seems to have attained a distinction hitherto considered impossible in the unconventional . It seems really original . It succeeds in holding in captivity the unexpected . ”</p>
   <p>Los Angeles : The Land of Sunshine .— “ It is unlike anything nearer to hand than ‘ Alice in Wonderland . ’ ”</p>
   <p># Lark Posters .#— The full set of Eight Posters for THE LARK will be sent post-paid for $ 2. 00 . The Lark Posters are printed from wooden blocks , all but the first two having been cut by the artist .</p>

     <l n="3">It was none o ’ your teenty little dots ,</l>
     <l n="4">With pinhole eyes an ’ pencil-spots ;</l>
     <l n="5">But this was a terribul big one — well ,</l>
     <l n="6">‘ T was a'most as high as the Palace Hotel !</l>
     <l n="7">It took ‘ em a year to chew the gum ! !</l>

     <l n="12">They brung it to him in gret big drays ;</l>
     <l n="13">An ’ fast as he got it good an ’ soft ,</l>
     <l n="14">Then Wallie he come and carried it oft .</l>
     <l n="15">Then he 'd roll it into a gret big ball ,</l>
     <l n="16">An ’ he made a-more'n a MILLION in all !</l>
     <l n="17">Then Huldy Ann she spanked ‘ em flat</l>
     <l n="18">An ’ pinched an ’ poked , an ’ the like o ’ that ,</l>
     <l n="19">Till she got it inter a gret big hunk —</l>

     <l n="29">They all was smooth with roundin ’ bends</l>
     <l n="30">An ’ chopped the fingers inter the ends !</l>

   <p>THE SOLES OF THE UNFORTUNATES .</p>
   <p>Likkery had but one leg [ A ] when I married him . [ B ] I did not realize what this meant { it meant 41 right-foot shoes [ for he was extravagant ( and I was economical [ C ]) to a degree ] in his dressing closet } until he died .</p>
   <p>{ I could not bear to throw { them away . { { The clerks asserted that all { their one-legged right-footed I could not get rid of them { customers wore { large sizes . [ D ] { { There were not weddings { enough to throw them all { after the carriages .</p>
   <p>Chapter II .</p>
   <note>Sidenote : Mr . Silk WAS a two-legged gentleman .</note>
   <p>My second marriage WOULD have been happy , but my husband met with a distressing accident , which necessitated an amputation ^{ of his right leg } of his wrong leg . So the collection increased .</p>
   <p>In spite of all my precautions , Mr . Silk 's shoes would often be left pointing toward the bed . [ E ] How I suffered ! At last Mr . Silk died . The day after the funeral , I made a procession of all the shoes —</p>
   <p>ORDER : 1 . Patent leathers 2 . Brogans 3 . Bluchers ( small ) 4 . Bluchers ( large ) 5 . Tan shoes 6 . Slippers ( carpet ) 7 . Congresses 8 . Riding boots 9 . Pumps</p>
   <p>Sixty-two right-foot shoes , ^{ toe to heel ,} they reached from my bedroom [ F ] to the stairs .</p>
   <p>I was in despair when a small-footed man named Box proposed to me . I looked at his feet and accepted him . ( I was sure the shoes would fit . )</p>
   <p>As soon as he was asleep I approached his prostrate form ( my axe was sharp { I ground it myself } and my mind was set ) .</p>
   <p>Sixty-two soles inspired me . [ G ] I struck the blow !— Then the HORROR of my deed seized me . The rest is too awful !</p>
   <p>NOTE : I had cut off the wrong foot !</p>
   <p>[ A ] Left leg .</p>
   <p>[ B ] Fool that I was .</p>

    <head>NOTES ON THE PASSING OF THE LARK</head>
    <p n="1">Literary Review .— “ Its ways were ways of pleasantness , and all its paths were peace . It had no enemies and all its friends were true ones . We see it go with a real regret and a feeling that we could have better spared a better paper . ” — CAROLYN WELLS .</p>
    <p n="2">New York Times .— “ Regret moderately deep and thoroughly sincere will be felt all over the country , at the announcement that The Lark has ceased publication . A considerable number of people could see no humor and less meaning in its songs , but thousands of others had keener eyes and ears , and looked and listened with delight . ”</p>
    <p n="3">Cincinnati Commercial Tribune .— “ The Lark is dead , and the Epilark has come and gone , leaving behind them only a haunting echo of joyous song and a love of living delicious to contemplate . ”</p>
    <p n="4">St. Paul Daily Globe .— “ But the mood in which we turn the Japanese pages of the last Lark is anything but flippant . It is something to have known youth and gayety , enthusiasm and a bravery which flies in the face of day , and now — something to have lost them . The Lark has lived and now dies well , and , to some at least , the time of its irregular appearance will no longer be a red-letter day . ”</p>
    <p n="5">The Philosopher .— “ And now The Lark announces its end . It was the freshest , purest breath of air that ever blew across the atmosphere of letters . ”</p>
    <p n="6">London Times .— “ So unique in literature and illustration , we are sorry to note that its publication is to be suspended . The bound volumes for the two years it has been running deserve a place in the libraries of all lovers of the odd and advanced in literature . ”</p>
    <p n="7">Paragraphs .— “ No more shall its cool notes delight the tree-tops , and no longer may we follow in the footsteps of Vivette . It is a pity , of course ; but what can you expect ? Larks must be fed , and — no one thinks of feeding them . ”</p>
    <p n="8">Trenton Tribune .— “ Its clever foolery shows how big a void was created when The Lark decided to sing no more . The Lark was the one new thing in junior magazinedom that did not outlive its welcome . ”</p>
    <p n="9">St. Louis Mirror .— “ It smacked of Robert Louis Stevenson . It was ‘ Alice in Wonderland ’ in picture . It was art through a crazy looking-glass . It was the realism of nonsense . The whole country laughed at the strange pictures with the brilliantly unintelligible verses . But much of it was not understood of the people who need diagrams . The Lark was always too high in the blue for the many ; but for those who might mount with him or to him — for those the magazinelet was published . Those enjoyed it ; and now they regret it — for The Lark is no more . It was so original that its death is its only unoriginality . ”</p>
    <p n="10"># The Lark Almanac for 1899 :#</p>
    <p n="11">Being a collection of vagaries from THE LARK , with original designs by Porter Garnett ; uniform in size with “ The Purple Cow . ” Price , 50c .</p>
    <p n="12">Published by WM . DOXEY , at the Sign of the Lark , San Francisco</p>
    <p n="13">“ Who 'll be the Clerk ! ” “ I ! ” said THE LARK .</p>
