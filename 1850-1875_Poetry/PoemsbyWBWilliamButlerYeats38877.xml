    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">During the last year I have spent much time altering “ The Countess Cathleen ” and “ The Land of Heart 's Desire ” that they might be a part of the repertory of the Abbey Theatre . I had written them before I had any practical experience , and I knew from the performance of the one in Dublin in 1899 and of the other in London in 1894 that they were full of defects . But in their new shape — and each play has been twice played during the winter — they have given me some pleasure , and are , I think , easier to play effectively than my later plays , depending less upon the players and more upon the producer , both having been imagined more for variety of stage-picture than variety of mood in the player . It was , indeed , the first performance of “ The Countess Cathleen , ” when our stage-pictures were made out of poor conventional scenery and hired costumes , that set me writing plays where all would depend upon the player . The first two scenes are wholly new , and though I have left the old end in the body of this book I have given in the notes an end less difficult to producer and audience , and there are slight alterations elsewhere in the poem . “ The Land of Heart 's Desire , ” besides some mending in the details , has been thrown back in time because the metrical speech would have sounded unreal if spoken in a country cottage now that we have so many dialect comedies . The shades of Mrs. Fallan and Mrs. Dillane and of Dan Bourke and the Tramp would have seemed too boisterous or too vivid for shades made cold and distant with the artifice of verse .</p>
    <p n="2">I have not again retouched the lyric poems of my youth , fearing some stupidity in my middle years , but have changed two or three pages that I always knew to be wrong in “ The Wanderings of Usheen . ”</p>
    <p n="3">W. B . YEATS .</p>
    <p n="4">June , 1912 .</p>
    <p n="5">PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</p>
    <p n="6">I have added some passages to “ The Land of Heart 's Desire , ” and a new scene of some little length , besides passages here and there , to “ The Countess Cathleen . ” The goddess has never come to me with her hands so full that I have not found many waste places after I had planted all that she had brought me . The present version of “ The Countess Cathleen ” is not quite the version adopted by the Irish Literary Theatre a couple of years ago , for our stage and scenery were capable of little ; and it may differ more from any stage version I make in future , for it seems that my people of the waters and my unhappy dead , in the third act , cannot keep their supernatural essence , but must put on too much of our mortality , in any ordinary theatre . I am told that I must abandon a meaning or two and make my merchants carry away the treasure themselves . The act was written long ago , when I had seen so few plays that I took pleasure in stage effects . Indeed , I am not yet certain that a wealthy theatre could not shape it to an impressive pageantry , or that a theatre without any wealth could not lift it out of pageantry into the mind , with a dim curtain , and some dimly lighted players , and the beautiful voices that should be as important in poetical as in musical drama . The Elizabethan stage was so little imprisoned in material circumstance that the Elizabethan imagination was not strained by god or spirit , nor even by Echo herself — no , not even when she answered , as in “ The Duchess of Malfi , ” in clear , loud words which were not the words that had been spoken to her . We have made a prison-house of paint and canvas , where we have as little freedom as under our own roofs , for there is no freedom in a house that has been made with hands . All art moves in the cave of the Chimaera , or in the garden of the Hesperides , or in the more silent house of the gods , and neither cave , nor garden , nor house can show itself clearly but to the mind 's eye .</p>
    <p n="7">Besides rewriting a lyric or two , I have much enlarged the note on “ The Countess Cathleen , ” as there has been some discussion in Ireland about the origin of the story , but the other notes are as they have always been . They are short enough , but I do not think that anybody who knows modern poetry will find obscurities in this book . In any case , I must leave my myths and symbols to explain themselves as the years go by and one poems lights up another , and the stories that friends , and one friend in particular , have gathered for me , or that I have gathered myself in many cottages , find their way into the light . I would , if I could , add to that majestic heraldry of the poets , that great and complicated inheritance of images which written literature has substituted for the greater and more complex inheritance of spoken tradition , some new heraldic images , gathered from the lips of the common people . Christianity and the old nature faith have lain down side by side in the cottages , and I would proclaim that peace as loudly as I can among the kingdoms of poetry , where there is no peace that is not joyous , no battle that does not give life instead of death ; I may even try to persuade others , in more sober prose , that there can be no language more worthy of poetry and of the meditation of the soul than that which has been made , or can be made , out of a subtlety of desire , an emotion of sacrifice , a delight in order , that are perhaps Christian , and myths and images that mirror the energies of woods and streams , and of their wild creatures . Has any part of that majestic heraldry of the poets had a very different fountain ? Is it not the ritual of the marriage of heaven and earth ?</p>
    <p n="8">These details may seem to many unnecessary ; but after all one writes poetry for a few careful readers and for a few friends , who will not consider such details unnecessary . When Cimabue had the cry it was , it seems , worth thinking of those that run ; but to-day , when they can write as well as read , one can sit with one 's companions under the hedgerow contentedly . If one writes well and has the patience , somebody will come from among the runners and read what one has written quickly , and go away quickly , and write out as much as he can remember in the language of the highway .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The old priest Peter Gilligan</l>
       <l n="2">Was weary night and day ;</l>
       <l n="3">For half his flock were in their beds ,</l>
       <l n="4">Or under green sods lay .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Once , while he nodded on a chair ,</l>
       <l n="6">At the moth-hour of eve ,</l>
       <l n="7">Another poor man sent for him ,</l>
       <l n="8">And he began to grieve .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">“ I have no rest , nor joy , nor peace ,</l>
       <l n="10">“ For people die and die ” ;</l>
       <l n="11">And after cried he , “ God forgive !</l>
       <l n="12">“ My body spake , not I ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">He knelt , and leaning on the chair</l>
       <l n="14">He prayed and fell asleep ;</l>
       <l n="15">And the moth-hour went from the fields ,</l>
       <l n="16">And stars began to peep .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">They slowly into millions grew ,</l>
       <l n="18">And leaves shook in the wind ;</l>
       <l n="19">And God covered the world with shade ,</l>
       <l n="20">And whispered to mankind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Upon the time of sparrow chirp</l>
       <l n="22">When the moths came once more ,</l>
       <l n="23">The old priest Peter Gilligan</l>
       <l n="24">Stood upright on the floor .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">“ Mavrone , mavrone ! the man has died ,</l>
       <l n="26">“ While I slept on the chair ” ;</l>
       <l n="27">He roused his horse out of its sleep ,</l>
       <l n="28">And rode with little care .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">He rode now as he never rode ,</l>
       <l n="30">By rocky lane and fen ;</l>
       <l n="31">The sick man 's wife opened the door :</l>
       <l n="32">“ Father ! you come again ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">“ And is the poor man dead ? ” he cried ,</l>
       <l n="34">“ He died an hour ago , ”</l>
       <l n="35">The old priest Peter Gilligan</l>
       <l n="36">In grief swayed to and fro .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">“ When you were gone , he turned and died</l>
       <l n="38">“ As merry as a bird . ”</l>
       <l n="39">The old priest Peter Gilligan</l>
       <l n="40">He knelt him at that word .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">“ He who hath made the night of stars</l>
       <l n="42">“ For souls , who tire and bleed ,</l>
       <l n="43">“ Sent one of His great angels down</l>
       <l n="44">“ To help me in my need .</l>

      <head>THE TWO TREES</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Beloved , gaze in thine own heart ,</l>
       <l n="2">The holy tree is growing there ;</l>
       <l n="3">From joy the holy branches start ,</l>
       <l n="4">And all the trembling flowers they bear .</l>
       <l n="5">The changing colours of its fruit</l>
       <l n="6">Have dowered the stars with merry light ;</l>
       <l n="7">The surety of its hidden root</l>
       <l n="8">Has planted quiet in the night ;</l>
       <l n="9">The shaking of its leafy head</l>
       <l n="10">Has given the waves their melody ,</l>
       <l n="11">And made my lips and music wed ,</l>
       <l n="12">Murmuring a wizard song for thee .</l>
       <l n="13">There , through bewildered branches , go</l>
       <l n="14">Winged Loves borne on in gentle strife ,</l>
       <l n="15">Tossing and tossing to and fro</l>
       <l n="16">The flaming circle of our life .</l>
       <l n="17">When looking on their shaken hair ,</l>
       <l n="18">And dreaming how they dance and dart ,</l>
       <l n="19">Thine eyes grow full of tender care :</l>
       <l n="20">Beloved , gaze in thine own heart .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="21">Gaze no more in the bitter glass</l>
       <l n="22">The demons , with their subtle guile ,</l>
       <l n="23">Lift up before us when they pass ,</l>
       <l n="24">Or only gaze a little while ;</l>
       <l n="25">For there a fatal image grows ,</l>
       <l n="26">With broken boughs , and blackened leaves ,</l>
       <l n="27">And roots half hidden under snows</l>
       <l n="28">Driven by a storm that ever grieves .</l>
       <l n="29">For all things turn to barrenness</l>
       <l n="30">In the dim glass the demons hold ,</l>
       <l n="31">The glass of outer weariness ,</l>
       <l n="32">Made when God slept in times of old .</l>
       <l n="33">There , through the broken branches , go</l>
       <l n="34">The ravens of unresting thought ;</l>
       <l n="35">Peering and flying to and fro</l>
       <l n="36">To see men 's souls bartered and bought .</l>
       <l n="37">When they are heard upon the wind ,</l>
       <l n="38">And when they shake their wings ; alas !</l>
       <l n="39">Thy tender eyes grow all unkind :</l>
       <l n="40">Gaze no more in the bitter glass .</l>

       <l n="2">Sligo , and at a remote time .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>SCENE .— A room with a hearth on the floor in the middle of a deep alcove to the Right . There are benches in the alcove and a table ; and a crucifix on the wall . The alcove is full of a glow of light from the fire . There is an open door facing the audience to the Left , and to the left of this a bench . Through the door one can see the forest . It is night , but the moon or a late sunset glimmers through the trees and carries the eye far off into a vague , mysterious world . MAURTEEN BRUIN , SHAWN BRUIN , and BRIDGET BRUIN sit in the alcove at the table or about the fire . They are dressed in the costume of some remote time , and near them sits an old priest , FATHER HART . He may be dressed as a friar . There is food and drink upon the table . MARY BRUIN stands by the door reading a book . If she looks up she can see through the door into the wood .</p>

      <head>THE SAD SHEPHERD</head>
       <l n="1">There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend ,</l>

       <l n="11">Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill ;</l>
       <l n="12">He fled the persecution of her glory</l>
       <l n="13">And , in a far-off , gentle valley stopping ,</l>

       <l n="20">Till my own words , re-echoing , shall send</l>
       <l n="21">Their sadness through a hollow , pearly heart ;</l>

       <l n="23">And my own whispering words be comforting ,</l>
       <l n="24">And lo ! my ancient burden may depart .</l>
       <l n="25">Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim ;</l>
       <l n="26">But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone</l>
       <l n="27">Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan</l>

      <head>THE INDIAN UPON GOD</head>
       <l n="1">I passed along the water 's edge below the humid trees ,</l>
       <l n="2">My spirit rocked in evening light , the rushes round my knees ,</l>
       <l n="3">My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs ; and saw the moorfowl pace</l>
       <l n="4">All dripping on a grassy slope , and saw them cease to chase</l>
       <l n="5">Each other round in circles , and heard the eldest speak :</l>
       <l n="6">Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong or weak</l>
       <l n="7">Is an undying moorfowl , and He lives beyond the sky .</l>
       <l n="8">The rains are from His dripping wing , the moonbeams from His eye .</l>
       <l n="9">I passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk :</l>
       <l n="10">Who made the world and ruleth it , He hangeth on a stalk ,</l>
       <l n="11">For I am in His image made , and all this tinkling tide</l>
       <l n="12">Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide .</l>
       <l n="13">A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes</l>
       <l n="14">Brimful of starlight , and he said : The Stamper of the Skies ,</l>
       <l n="15">He is a gentle roebuck ; for how else , I pray , could He</l>
       <l n="16">Conceive a thing so sad and soft , a gentle thing like me ?</l>
       <l n="17">I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say :</l>
       <l n="18">Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay ,</l>
       <l n="19">He is a monstrous peacock , and He waveth all the night</l>
       <l n="20">His languid tail above us , lit with myriad spots of light .</l>

       <l n="40">Like sooty fingers , many a tree</l>

       <l n="77">Was dim with mire of a mortal shore ,</l>
       <l n="78">They fingered it and gazed on me</l>
       <l n="79">And laughed like murmurs of the sea ;</l>

       <l n="112">That kept dim waters from the sky ;</l>
       <l n="113">And each one said , with a long , long sigh ,</l>

       <l n="1">Yes , yes ,</l>
       <l n="2">For these were ancient Usheen 's fate</l>
       <l n="3">Loosed long ago from heaven 's gate ,</l>
       <l n="4">For his last days to lie in wait .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">When one day by the tide I stood ,</l>
       <l n="6">I found in that forgetfulness</l>
       <l n="7">Of dreamy foam a staff of wood</l>
       <l n="8">From some dead warrior 's broken lance :</l>
       <l n="9">I turned it in my hands ; the stains</l>
       <l n="10">Of war were on it , and I wept ,</l>
       <l n="11">Remembering how the Fenians stept</l>
       <l n="12">Along the blood-bedabbled plains ,</l>
       <l n="13">Equal to good or grievous chance :</l>
       <l n="14">Thereon young Niam softly came</l>
       <l n="15">And caught my hands , but spake no word</l>
       <l n="16">Save only many times my name ,</l>
       <l n="17">In murmurs , like a frighted bird .</l>
       <l n="18">We passed by woods , and lawns of clover ,</l>
       <l n="19">And found the horse and bridled him ,</l>
       <l n="20">For we knew well the old was over .</l>
       <l n="21">I heard one say “ His eyes grow dim</l>
       <l n="22">“ With all the ancient sorrow of men ” ;</l>
       <l n="23">And wrapped in dreams rode out again</l>
       <l n="24">With hoofs of the pale findrinny</l>
       <l n="25">Over the glimmering purple sea :</l>
       <l n="26">Under the golden evening light .</l>
       <l n="27">The immortals moved among the fountains</l>
       <l n="28">By rivers and the woods ’ old night ;</l>
       <l n="29">Some danced like shadows on the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="30">Some wandered ever hand in hand ,</l>
       <l n="31">Or sat in dreams on the pale strand ;</l>
       <l n="32">Each forehead like an obscure star</l>
       <l n="33">Bent down above each hooked knee :</l>
       <l n="34">And sang , and with a dreamy gaze</l>
       <l n="35">Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze</l>
       <l n="36">Was slumbering half in the sea ways ;</l>
       <l n="37">And , as they sang , the painted birds</l>
       <l n="38">Kept time with their bright wings and feet ;</l>
       <l n="39">Like drops of honey came their words ,</l>
       <l n="40">But fainter than a young lamb 's bleat .</l>

       <l n="41">“ An old man stirs the fire to a blaze ,</l>
       <l n="42">“ In the house of a child , of a friend , of a brother</l>
       <l n="43">“ He has over-lingered his welcome ; the days ,</l>
       <l n="44">“ Grown desolate , whisper and sigh to each other ;</l>
       <l n="45">“ He hears the storm in the chimney above ,</l>
       <l n="46">“ And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold ,</l>
       <l n="47">“ While his heart still dreams of battle and love ,</l>
       <l n="48">“ And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="49">“ But we are apart in the grassy places ,</l>

       <l n="55">“ Before the swift things that she dreamed of were done</l>
       <l n="56">“ She limps along in an aged whiteness ;</l>
       <l n="57">“ A storm of birds in the Asian trees</l>
       <l n="58">“ Like tulips in the air a-winging ,</l>
       <l n="59">“ And the gentle waves of the summer seas ,</l>
       <l n="60">“ That raise their heads and wander singing .</l>
       <l n="61">“ Must murmur at last ‘ Unjust , unjust ’ ;</l>
       <l n="62">“ And ‘ My speed is a weariness , ’ falters the mouse</l>
       <l n="63">“ And the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust ,</l>
       <l n="64">“ And the roof falls in of his tunnelled house .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="65">“ But the love-dew dims our eyes till the day</l>
       <l n="66">“ When God shall come from the sea with a sigh</l>
       <l n="67">“ And bid the stars drop down from the sky ,</l>
       <l n="68">“ And the moon like a pale rose wither away . ”</l>

       <l n="1">Now , man of croziers , shadows called our names</l>

       <l n="23">Woven into her hair , before dark towers</l>

       <l n="25">About them ; and the horse of faery screamed</l>

       <l n="29">A foaming tide</l>
       <l n="30">Whitened afar with surge , fan-formed and wide ,</l>
       <l n="31">Burst from a great door marred by many a blow</l>
       <l n="32">From mace and sword and pole-axe , long ago</l>
       <l n="33">When gods and giants warred . We rode between</l>
       <l n="34">The seaweed-covered pillars , and the green</l>
       <l n="35">And surging phosphorus alone gave light</l>
       <l n="36">On our dark pathway , till a countless flight</l>
       <l n="37">Of moonlit steps glimmered ; and left and right</l>
       <l n="38">Dark statues glimmered over the pale tide</l>
       <l n="39">Upon dark thrones . Between the lids of one</l>
       <l n="40">The imaged meteors had flashed and run</l>
       <l n="41">And had disported in the stilly jet ,</l>
       <l n="42">And the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set ,</l>
       <l n="43">Since God made Time and Death and Sleep : the other</l>
       <l n="44">Stretched his long arm to where , a misty smother ,</l>
       <l n="45">The stream churned , churned , and churned — his lips apart ,</l>
       <l n="46">As though he told his never slumbering heart</l>
       <l n="47">Of every foamdrop on its misty way :</l>
       <l n="48">Tying the horse to his vast foot that lay</l>
       <l n="49">Half in the unvesselled sea , we climbed the stairs</l>

       <l n="148">Lest they should look upon some dreadful sight ;</l>
       <l n="149">And thrust the torch between the slimy flags .</l>
       <l n="150">A dome made out of endless carven jags ,</l>
       <l n="151">Where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face ,</l>
       <l n="152">Looked down on me ; and in the self-same place</l>

       <l n="154">Windowless , pillarless , multitudinous home</l>
       <l n="155">Of faces , waited ; and the leisured gaze</l>
       <l n="156">Was loaded with the memory of days</l>
       <l n="157">Buried and mighty . When through the great door</l>
       <l n="158">The dawn came in , and glimmered on the floor</l>
       <l n="159">With a pale light , I journeyed round the hall</l>
       <l n="160">And found a door deep sunken in the wall ,</l>
       <l n="161">The least of doors ; beyond on a dim plain</l>
       <l n="162">A little runnel made a bubbling strain ,</l>
       <l n="163">And on the runnel 's stony and bare edge</l>
       <l n="164">A husky demon dry as a withered sedge</l>
       <l n="165">Swayed , crooning to himself an unknown tongue :</l>
       <l n="166">In a sad revelry he sang and swung</l>
       <l n="167">Bacchant and mournful , passing to and fro</l>
       <l n="168">His hand along the runnel 's side , as though</l>
       <l n="169">The flowers still grew there : far on the sea 's waste</l>
       <l n="170">Shaking and waving , vapour vapour chased ,</l>
       <l n="171">While high frail cloudlets , fed with a green light ,</l>
       <l n="172">Like drifts of leaves , immovable and bright ,</l>
       <l n="173">Hung in the passionate dawn . He slowly turned :</l>
       <l n="174">A demon 's leisure : eyes , first white , now burned</l>
       <l n="175">Like wings of kingfishers ; and he arose</l>
       <l n="176">Barking . We trampled up and down with blows</l>
       <l n="177">Of sword and brazen battle-axe , while day</l>
       <l n="178">Gave to high noon and noon to night gave way ;</l>
       <l n="179">And when at withering of the sun he knew</l>

       <l n="181">To many shapes ; I lunged at the smooth throat</l>

       <l n="183">A fir-tree roaring in its leafless top ;</l>
       <l n="184">I held a dripping corpse , with livid chop</l>
       <l n="185">And sunken shape , against my face and breast ,</l>
       <l n="186">When I tore down the tree ; but when the west</l>
       <l n="187">Surged up in plumy fire , I lunged and drave</l>
       <l n="188">Through heart and spine , and cast him in the wave ,</l>

       <l n="194">Then in that hall , lit by the dim sea shine ,</l>
       <l n="195">We lay on skins of otters , and drank wine ,</l>
       <l n="196">Brewed by the sea-gods , from huge cups that lay</l>

    <head>GLOSSARY AND NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">The Pronunciation of the Irish Words .— When I wrote the greater number of these poems I had hardly considered the question seriously . I copied at times somebody 's perhaps fanciful phonetic spelling , and at times the ancient spelling as I found it in some literal translation , pronouncing the words always as they were spelt . I do not suppose I would have defended this system at any time , but I do not yet know what system to adopt . The modern pronunciation , which is usually followed by those who spell the words phonetically , is certainly unlike the pronunciation of the time when classical Irish literature was written , and , so far as I know , no Irish scholar who writes in English or French has made that minute examination of the way the names come into the rhythms and measures of the old poems which can alone discover the old pronunciation . A French Celtic scholar gave me the pronunciation of a few names , and told me that Mr. Whitley Stokes had written something about the subject in German , but I am ignorant of German . If I ever learn the old pronunciation , I will revise all these poems , but at present I can only affirm that I have not treated my Irish names as badly as the mediaeval writers of the stories of King Arthur treated their Welsh names .</p>
    <p n="2">Mythological Gods and Heroes .— I refer the reader for such names as Balor and Finn and Usheen to Lady Gregory 's “ Cuchulain of Muirthemne ” and to her “ Gods and Fighting Men . ”</p>
    <p n="3">The Ballad of Father Gilligan .— A tradition among the people of Castleisland , Kerry .</p>
    <p n="4">The Ballad of Father O'Hart .— This ballad is founded on the story of a certain Father O'Hart , priest of Coloony , Sligo , in the last century , as told by the present priest of Coloony in his History of Ballisodare and Kilvarnet . The robbery of the lands of Father O'Hart was a kind of robbery which occurred but rarely during the penal laws . Catholics , forbidden to own landed property , evaded the law by giving a Protestant nominal possession of their estates . There are instances on record in which poor men were nominal owners of immense estates .</p>
    <p n="5">The Ballad of the Foxhunter .— Founded on an incident , probably itself a Tipperary tradition , in Kickham 's Knockagow .</p>
    <p n="6">Bell-branch .— A legendary branch whose shaking casts all men into a sleep .</p>
    <p n="7">The Countess Cathleen .— I found the story of the Countess Cathleen in what professed to be a collection of Irish folk-lore in an Irish newspaper some years ago . I wrote to the compiler , asking about its source , but got no answer , but have since heard that it was translated from Les Matinees de Timothe Trimm a good many years ago , and has been drifting about the Irish press ever since . Leo Lespes gives it as an Irish story , and though the editor of Folklore has kindly advertised for information , the only Christian variant I know of is a Donegal tale , given by Mr. Larminie in his West Irish Folk Tales and Romances , of a woman who goes to hell for ten years to save her husband , and stays there another ten , having been granted permission to carry away as many souls as could cling to her skirt . Leo Lespes may have added a few details , but I have no doubt of the essential antiquity of what seems to me the most impressive form of one of the supreme parables of the world . The parable came to the Greeks in the sacrifice of Alcestis , but her sacrifice was less overwhelming , less apparently irremediable . Leo Lespes tells the story as follows :—</p>
    <p n="8">Ce que je vais vous dire est un recit du careme Irlandais . Le boiteux , l'aveugle , le paralytique des rues de Dublin ou de Limerick , vous le diraient mieux que moi , cher lecteur , si vous alliez le leur demander , un sixpense d'argent a la main .— Il n'est pas une jeune fille catholique a laquelle on ne l'ait appris pendant les jours de preparation a la communion sainte , pas un berger des bords de la Blackwater qui ne le puisse redire a la veillee .</p>
    <p n="9">Il y a bien longtemps qu'il apparut tout-a-coup dans la vielle Irlande deux marchands inconnus dont personne n'avait oui parler , et qui parlaient neanmoins avec la plus grande perfection la langue du pays . Leurs cheveux etaient noirs et ferres avec de l'or et leurs robes d'une grande magnificence .</p>
    <p n="10">Tous deux semblaient avoir le meme age ; ils paraissaient etre des hommes de cinquante ans , car leur barbe grisonnait un peu .</p>
    <p n="11">Or , a cette epoque , comme aujourd'hui , l'Irlande etait pauvre , car le soleil avait ete rare , et des recoltes presque nulles . Les indigents ne savaient a quel sainte se vouer , et la misere devenait de plus en plus terrible .</p>
    <p n="12">Dans l'hotellerie ou descendirent les marchands fastueux on chercha a penetrer leurs desseins : mais ce fut en vain , ils demeurerent silencieux et discrets .</p>
    <p n="13">Et pendant qu'ils demeurerent dans l'hotellerie , ils ne cesserent de compter et de recompter des sacs de pieces d'or , dont la vive clarte s'apercevait a travers les vitres du logis .</p>
    <p n="14">Gentlemen , leur dit l'hotesse un jour , d'ou vient que vous etes si opulents , et que , venus pour secourir la misere publique , vous ne fassiez pas de bonnes oeuvres ?</p>
    <p n="15">— Belle hotesse , repondit l'un d'eux , nous n'avons pas voulu aller au-devant d'infortunes honorables , dans la crainte d'etre trompes par des miseres fictives : que la douleur frappe a la porte , nous ouvrirons .</p>
    <p n="16">Le lendemain , quand on sut qu'il existait deux opulents etrangers prets a prodiguer l'or , la foule assiegea leur logis ; mais les figures des gens qui en sortaient etaient bien diverses . Les uns avaient la fierte dans le regard , les autres portaient la honte au front . Les deux trafiquants achetaient des ames pour le demon . L'ame d'un vieillard valait vingt pieces d'or , pas un penny de plus ; car Satan avait eu le temps d'y former hypotheque . L'ame d'une epose en valait cinquante quand elle etait jolie , ou cent quand elle etait laide . L'ame d'une jeune fille se payait des prix fous : les fleurs les plus belles et les plus pures sont les plus cheres .</p>
    <p n="17">Pendant ce temps , il existait dans la ville un ange de beaute , la comtesse Ketty O'Connor . Elle etait l'idole du peuple , et la providence des indigents . Des qu'elle eut appris que des mecreants profitaient de la misere publique pour derober des coeurs a Dieu , elle fit appeler son majordome .</p>
    <p n="18">— Master Patrick , lui dit elle , combien ai-je de pieces d'or dans mon coffre ?</p>
    <p n="19">— Cent mille .</p>
    <p n="20">— Combien de bijoux ?</p>
    <p n="21">— Peur autant d'argent .</p>
    <p n="22">— Combien de chateux , de bois et de terres ?</p>
    <p n="23">— Pour le double de ces sommes .</p>
    <p n="24">— Eh bien ! Patrick , vendez tout ce qui n'est pas or et apportez-m'en le montant . Je ne veux garder a moi que ce castel et le champ qui l'entoure .</p>
    <p n="25">Deux jours apres , les ordres de la pieuse Ketty etaient executes et le tresor etait distribue aux pauvres au fur et a mesure de leurs besoins .</p>
    <p n="26">Ceci ne faisait pas le compte , dit la tradition , des commis-voyageurs du malin esprit , qui ne trouvaient plus d'ames a acheter .</p>
    <p n="27">Aides par un valet infame , ils penetrerent dans la retraite de la noble dame et lui deroberent le reste de son tresor ... en vain lutta-t-elle de toutes ses forces pour sauver le contenu de son coffre , les larrons diaboliques furent les plus forts . Si Ketty avait eu les moyens de faire un signe de croix , ajoute la legende Irlandaise , elle les eut mis en fuite , mais ses mains etaient captives — Le larcin fut effectue . Alors les pauvres solliciterent en vain pres de Ketty depouillee , elle ne pouvait plus secourir leur misere ;— elle les abandonnait a la tentation . Pourtant il n'y avait plus que huit jours a passer pour que les grains et lea fourrages arrivassent en abondance des pays d'Orient . Mais , huit jours , c'etait un siecle : huit jours necessitaient une somme immense pour subvenir aux exigences de la disette , et les pauvres allaient ou expirer dans les angousses de la faim , ou , reniant les saintes maximes de l'Evangile , vendre a vil prix leur ame , le plus beau present de la munificence du Seigneur tout-puissant .</p>
    <p n="28">Et Ketty n'avait plus une obole , car elle avait abandonne son chateux aux malheureux .</p>
    <p n="29">Elle passa douze heures dans les larmes et le deuil , arrachant ses cheveux couleur de soleil et meurtrissant son sein couleur du lis : puis elle se leva resolue , animee par un vif sentiment de desespoir .</p>
    <p n="30">Elle se rendit chez les marchands d'ames .</p>
    <p n="31">— Que voulez-vous ? dirent ils .</p>
    <p n="32">— Vous achetez des ames ?</p>
    <p n="33">— Oui , un peu malgre vous , n'est ce pas , sainte aux yeux de saphir ?</p>
    <p n="34">— Aujourd'hui je viens vous proposer un marche , reprit elle .</p>
    <p n="35">— Lequel ?</p>
    <p n="36">— J'ai une ame a vendre ; mais elle est chere .</p>
    <p n="37">— Qu'importe si elle est precieuse ? l'ame , comme le diamant , s'apprecie a sa blancheur .</p>
    <p n="38">— C'est la mienne , dit Ketty .</p>
    <p n="39">Les deux envoyes de Satan tressaillirent . Leurs griffes s'allongerent sous leurs gants de cuir ; leurs yeux gris etincelerent — l'ame , pure , immaculee , virginale de Ketty !... c'etait une acquisition inappreciable .</p>
    <p n="40">— Gentille dame , combien voulez-vous ?</p>
    <p n="41">— Cent cinquante mille ecus d'or .</p>
    <p n="42">— C'est fait , dirent les marchands : et ils tendirent a Ketty un parchemin cachete de noir , qu'elle signa en frissonnant .</p>
    <p n="43">La somme lui fut comptee .</p>
    <p n="44">Des qu'elle fut rentree , elle dit au majordome :</p>
    <p n="45">— Tenez , distribuez ceci . Avec la somme que je vous donne les pauvres attendront la huitaine necessaire et pas une de leurs ames ne sera livree au demon .</p>
    <p n="46">Puis elle s'enferma et recommanda qu'on ne vint pas la deranger .</p>
    <p n="47">Trois jours se passerent ; elle n'appela pas ; elle ne sortit pas .</p>
    <p n="48">Quand on ouvrit sa porte , on la trouva raide et froide : elle etait morte de douleur .</p>
    <p n="49">Mais la vente de cette ame si adorable dans sa charite fut declaree nulle par le Seigneur : car elle avait sauve ses concitoyens de la morte eternelle .</p>
    <p n="50">Apres la huitaine , des vaisseaux nombreux amenerent a l'Irlande affamee d'immenses provisions de grains .</p>
    <p n="51">La famine n'etait plus possible . Quant aux marchands , ils disparurent de leur hotellerie , sans qu'on sut jamais ce qu'ils etaient devenus .</p>
    <p n="52">Toutefois , les pecheurs de la Blackwater pretendent qu'ils sont enchaines dans une prison souterraine par ordre de Lucifer jusqu'au moment ou ils pourront livrer l'ame de Ketty qui leur a echappe . Je vous dis la legende telle que je la sais .</p>
    <p n="53">— Mais les pauvres l'ont raconte d'age en age et les enfants de Cork et de Dublin chantent encore la ballade dont voici les derniers couplets :—</p>
    <p n="54">Pour sauver les pauvres qu'elle aime Ketty donna Son esprit , sa croyance meme : Satan paya Cette ame au devoument sublime , En ecus d'or , Disons pour racheter son crime , Confiteor .</p>
    <p n="55">Mais l'ange qui se fit coupable Par charite Au sejour d'amour ineffable Est remonte . Satan vaincu n'eut pas de prise Sur ce coeur d'or ; Chantons sous la nef de l'eglise , Confiteor .</p>
    <p n="56">N'est ce pas que ce recit , ne de l'imagination des poetes catholiques de la verte Erin , est une veritable recit de careme ?</p>
    <p n="57">The Countess Cathleen was acted in Dublin in 1899 , with Mr. Marcus St. John and Mr. Trevor Lowe as the First and Second Demon , Mr. Valentine Grace as Shemus Rua , Master Charles Sefton as Teig , Madame San Carola as Mary , Miss Florence Farr as Aleel , Miss Anna Mather as Oona , Mr. Charles Holmes as the Herdsman , Mr. Jack Wilcox as the Gardener , Mr. Walford as a Peasant , Miss Dorothy Paget as a Spirit , Miss M. Kelly as a Peasant Woman , Mr. T. E . Wilkinson as a Servant , and Miss May Whitty as The Countess Kathleen . They had to face a very vehement opposition stirred up by a politician and a newspaper , the one accusing me in a pamphlet , the other in long articles day after day , of blasphemy because of the language of the demons or of Shemus Rua , and because I made a woman sell her soul and yet escape damnation , and of a lack of patriotism because I made Irish men and women , who , it seems , never did such a thing , sell theirs . The politician or the newspaper persuaded some forty Catholic students to sign a protest against the play , and a Cardinal , who avowed that he had not read it , to make another , and both politician and newspaper made such obvious appeals to the audience to break the peace , that a score or so of police were sent to the theatre to see that they did not . I had , however , no reason to regret the result , for the stalls , containing almost all that was distinguished in Dublin , and a gallery of artisans alike insisted on the freedom of literature .</p>
    <p n="58">After the performance in 1899 I added the love scene between Aleel and the Countess , and in this new form the play was revived in New York by Miss Wycherley as well as being played a good deal in England and America by amateurs . Now at last I have made a complete revision to make it suitable for performance at the Abbey Theatre . The first two scenes are almost wholly new , and throughout the play I have added or left out such passages as a stage experience of some years showed me encumbered the action ; the play in its first form having been written before I knew anything of the theatre . I have left the old end , however , in the version printed in the body of this book , because the change for dramatic purposes has been made for no better reason than that audiences — even at the Abbey Theatre — are almost ignorant of Irish mythology — or because a shallow stage made the elaborate vision of armed angels upon a mountain-side impossible . The new end is particularly suited to the Abbey stage , where the stage platform can be brought out in front of the proscenium and have a flight of steps at one side up which the Angel comes , crossing towards the back of the stage at the opposite side . The principal lighting is from two arc lights in the balcony which throw their lights into the faces of the players , making footlights unnecessary . The room at Shemus Rua 's house is suggested by a great grey curtain — a colour which becomes full of rich tints under the stream of light from the arcs . The two or more arches in the third scene permit the use of a gauze . The short front scene before the last is just long enough when played with incidental music to allow the scene set behind it to be changed . The play when played without interval in this way lasts a little over an hour .</p>
    <p n="59">The play was performed at the Abbey Theatre for the first time on December 14 , 1911 , Miss Maire O'Neill taking the part of the Countess , and the last scene from the going out of the Merchants was as follows :—</p>
    <p n="60">( MERCHANTS rush out . ALEEL crawls into the middle of the room ; the twilight has fallen and gradually darkens as the scene goes on . )</p>
    <p n="61">ALEEL</p>
    <p n="62">They 're rising up — they 're rising through the earth , Fat Asmodel and giddy Belial , And all the fiends . Now they leap in the air . But why does Hell 's gate creak so ? Round and round . Hither and hither , to and fro they 're running .</p>
    <p n="63">( He moves about as though the air was full of spirits . OONA enters . )</p>
    <p n="64">Crouch down , old heron , out of the blind storm .</p>
    <p n="65">OONA</p>
    <p n="66">Where is the Countess Cathleen ? All this day Her eyes were full of tears , and when for a moment Her hand was laid upon my hand , it trembled . And now I do not know where she is gone .</p>
    <p n="67">ALEEL</p>
    <p n="68">Cathleen has chosen other friends than us , And they are rising through the hollow world . Demons are out , old heron .</p>
    <p n="69">OONA</p>
    <p n="70">God guard her soul .</p>
    <p n="71">ALEEL</p>
    <p n="72">She 's bartered it away this very hour , As though we two were never in the world .</p>
    <p n="73">( He kneels beside her , but does not seem to hear her words . The PEASANTS return . They carry the COUNTESS CATHLEEN and lay her upon the ground before OONA and ALEEL . She lies there as if dead . )</p>
    <p n="74">OONA</p>
    <p n="75">O , that so many pitchers of rough clay Should prosper and the porcelain break in two !</p>
    <p n="76">( She kisses the hands of CATHLEEN . )</p>
    <p n="77">A PEASANT</p>
    <p n="78">We were under the tree where the path turns When she grew pale as death and fainted away .</p>
    <p n="79">CATHLEEN</p>
    <p n="80">O , hold me , and hold me tightly , for the storm Is dragging me away .</p>
    <p n="81">( OONA takes her in her arms . A WOMAN begins to wail . )</p>
    <p n="82">PEASANTS</p>
    <p n="83">Hush !</p>
    <p n="84">PEASANTS</p>
    <p n="85">Hush !</p>
    <p n="86">PEASANT WOMEN</p>
    <p n="87">Hush !</p>
    <p n="88">OTHER PEASANT WOMEN</p>
    <p n="89">Hush !</p>
    <p n="90">CATHLEEN ( half rising )</p>
    <p n="91">Lay all the bags of money in a heap , And when I am gone , old Oona , share them out To every man and woman : judge , and give According to their needs .</p>
    <p n="92">A PEASANT WOMAN</p>
    <p n="93">And will she give Enough to keep my children through the dearth ?</p>
    <p n="94">ANOTHER PEASANT WOMAN</p>
    <p n="95">O , Queen of Heaven , and all you blessed saints , Let us and ours be lost , so she be shriven .</p>
    <p n="96">CATHLEEN</p>
    <p n="97">Bend down your faces , Oona and Aleel ; I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes Upon the nest under the eave , before She wander the loud waters . Do not weep Too great a while , for there is many a candle On the High Altar though one fall . Aleel , Who sang about the dancers of the woods , That know not the hard burden of the world , Having but breath in their kind bodies , farewell ! And farewell , Oona , you who played with me And bore me in your arms about the house When I was but a child — and therefore happy , Therefore happy even like those that dance . The storm is in my hair and I must go .</p>
    <p n="98">( She dies . )</p>
    <p n="99">OONA</p>
    <p n="100">Bring me the looking-glass .</p>
    <p n="101">( A WOMAN brings it to her out of inner room . OONA holds glass over the lips of CATHLEEN . All is silent for a moment , then she speaks in a half-scream . )</p>
    <p n="102">O , she is dead !</p>
    <p n="103">A PEASANT</p>
    <p n="104">She was the great white lily of the world .</p>
    <p n="105">A PEASANT</p>
    <p n="106">She was more beautiful than the pale stars .</p>
    <p n="107">AN OLD PEASANT WOMAN</p>
    <p n="108">The little plant I loved is broken in two .</p>
    <p n="109">( ALEEL takes looking-glass from OONA and flings it upon floor , so that it is broken in many pieces . )</p>
    <p n="110">ALEEL</p>
    <p n="111">I shatter you in fragments , for the face That brimmed you up with beauty is no more ; And die , dull heart , for you that were a mirror Are but a ball of passionate dust again ! And level earth and plumy sea , rise up ! And haughty sky , fall down !</p>
    <p n="112">A PEASANT WOMAN</p>
    <p n="113">Pull him upon his knees , His curses will pluck lightning on our heads .</p>
    <p n="114">ALEEL</p>
    <p n="115">Angels and devils clash in the middle air , And brazen swords clang upon brazen helms . Look , look , a spear has gone through Belial 's eye !</p>
    <p n="116">( A winged ANGEL , carrying a torch and a sword , enters from the R. with eyes fixed upon some distant thing . The ANGEL is about to pass out to the L. when ALEEL speaks . The ANGEL stops a moment and turns . )</p>
    <p n="117">Look no more on the half-closed gates of Hell , But speak to me whose mind is smitten of God , That it may be no more with mortal things : And tell of her who lies there .</p>
    <p n="118">( The ANGEL turns again and is about to go , but is seized by ALEEL . )</p>
    <p n="119">Till you speak You shall not drift into eternity .</p>
    <p n="120">THE ANGEL</p>
    <p n="121">The light beats down ; the gates of pearl are wide . And she is passing to the floor of peace , And Mary of the seven times wounded heart Has kissed her lips , and the long blessed hair Has fallen on her face ; the Light of Lights Looks always on the motive , not the deed , The Shadow of Shadows on the deed alone .</p>
    <p n="122">( ALEEL releases the ANGEL and kneels . )</p>
    <p n="123">OONA</p>
    <p n="124">Tell them to walk upon the floor of peace , That I would die and go to her I love ; The years like great black oxen tread the world , And God the herdsman goads them on behind , And I am broken by their passing feet .</p>
    <p n="125">Down by the Salley Gardens .— An extension of three lines sung to me by an old woman at Ballisodare .</p>
    <p n="126">Findrinny ( Findruine ) .— A kind of white bronze .</p>
    <p n="127">Finvarra ( Finbar ) .— The king of the faeries of Connaught .</p>
    <p n="128">Hell .— In the older Irish books Hell is always cold , and it may be because the Fomoroh , or evil powers , ruled over the north and the winter . Christianity adopted as far as possible the Pagan symbolism in Ireland as elsewhere , and Irish poets , when they spoke of “ the cold flagstone of Hell , ” may have repeated Pagan symbolism . The folk-tales , and Keating in his description of Hell , make use , however , of the ordinary symbolism of fire .</p>
    <p n="129">The Lamentation of the Pensioner .— This poem is little more than a translation into verse of the very words of an old Wicklow peasant . Fret means doom or destiny .</p>
    <p n="130">The Land of Heart 's Desire .— This little play was produced at the Avenue Theatre in the spring of 1894 , with the following cast :— Maurteen Bruin , Mr. James Welch ; Shawn Bruin , Mr. A. E. W . Mason ; Father Hart , Mr. G. R . Foss ; Bridget Bruin , Miss Charlotte Morland ; Maire Bruin , Miss Winifred Fraser ; A Faery Child , Miss Dorothy Paget . It ran for a little over six weeks . It was revived in America in 1901 , when it was taken on tour by Mrs. Lemoyne . It has been played two or three times professionally since then in America and a great many times in England and America by amateurs . Till lately it was not part of the repertory of the Abbey Theatre , for I had grown to dislike it without knowing what I disliked in it . This winter , however , I have made many revisions and now it plays well enough to give me pleasure . It is printed in this book in the new form , which was acted for the first time on February 22 , 1912 , at the Abbey Theatre , Dublin . At the Abbey Theatre , where the platform of the stage comes out in front of the curtain , the curtain falls before the priest 's last words . He remains outside the curtain and the words are spoken to the audience like an epilogue .</p>
    <p n="131">The Meditation of the Old Fisherman .— This poem is founded upon some things a fisherman said to me when out fishing in Sligo Bay .</p>
    <p n="132">Northern Cold .— The Fomor , the powers of death and darkness and cold and evil , came from the north .</p>
    <p n="133">Nuala .— The wife of Finvarra .</p>
    <p n="134">Rose .— The rose is a favourite symbol with the Irish poets , and has given a name to several poems both Gaelic and English , and is used in love poems , in addresses to Ireland like Mr. Aubrey de Vere 's poem telling how “ The little black rose shall be red at last , ” and in religious poems , like the old Gaelic one which speaks of “ the Rose of Friday , ” meaning the Rose of Austerity .</p>
    <p n="135">Salley .— Willow .</p>
    <p n="136">Seven Hazel-trees .— There was once a well overshadowed by seven sacred hazel-trees , in the midst of Ireland . A certain woman plucked their fruit , and seven rivers arose out of the well and swept her away . In my poems this well is the source of all the waters of this world , which are therefore seven-fold .</p>
    <p n="137">The Wanderings of Usheen .— The poem is founded upon the middle Irish dialogues of S. Patric and Usheen and a certain Gaelic poem of the last century . The events it describes , like the events in most of the poems in this volume , are supposed to have taken place rather in the indefinite period , made up of many periods , described by the folk-tales , than in any particular century ; it therefore , like the later Fenian stories themselves , mixes much that is mediaeval with much that is ancient . The Gaelic poems do not make Usheen go to more than one island , but a story in Silva Gadelica describes “ four paradises , ” an island to the north , an island to the west , an island to the south , and Adam 's paradise in the east .</p>
