   <p>JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX</p>
   <p>Johnny ’ s sand box is in the back yard . It is a fine big box , with the sides raised so that Johnny and the sand will not fall out . The sand is fine and dry , and almost white ; it came from the seashore , and sometimes you find a little shell in it .</p>
   <p>The things that belong in the sand box ( beside Johnny himself ! ) are the blue tin pail to hold sand , and the red tin pail to hold water , and the shovel , and the rake , and the old kitchen spoon . The things that do not belong there ( some of them ) are the woolly dog ( because the sand gets all into his wool , and then shakes out on the nursery floor , and Maggie says it is a Sight ! ) , and Johnny ’ s shoes and stockings ( he likes to take them off and sift the hot , clean sand between his bare toes ) , and the neighbors ’ cats .</p>
   <p>This story is about the cats . There are five of them . One is black , and has a red leather collar with a little silver bell ; it belongs to the deaf old lady next door , and its name is Jetty . Another is yellow , and belongs to the lame girl in the white house with green blinds ; its name is Topaz . The third cat is gray , with white front and paws . This is a lady cat , and her name is Malta ; she belongs to the lady whom Johnny calls Mrs . Nose . Mamma does not allow him to say this , and he tries to remember , but sometimes he forgets ; one day he said right out , “ Good morning , Mrs . Nose !” and she only laughed , and said her nose was just the right size , and she needed it all to smell catnip with . She is a funny lady , and Johnny likes her , and Malta too .</p>
   <p>The fourth cat belongs to Mr . Chops the butcher , and is a big tabby , with green eyes and fierce whiskers . Johnny does not like him at all . But the fifth cat is Muffet , his own dear white kitten .</p>
   <p>Now all these cats were friends except Bobs , the butcher ’ s cat . He lives on meat , and Mamma says perhaps that makes him cross . Anyhow , he is cross , and he growls and snarls and spits at Muffet and Jetty and Topaz and Malta , and tries to steal their fishbones , and upsets their milk , and is really a very horrid cat .</p>

   <p>The story happened one night last week . Johnny was asleep , and Maggie was tidying up the nursery before going to bed , when suddenly she heard a queer noise . It came from the yard , and she stepped to the window and looked out . It was bright moonlight ; and what do you think ? The cats were having a party in the sand box ! the four friendly cats , that is , Muffet and Topaz and Malta and Jetty . Maggie thought Muffet must have invited the others , for she was sitting in the middle of the box with her front paws tucked under her , looking so pleased and happy ; and the three others had their paws tucked in too , and they were all four talking in little soft mews , and seemed to be having a very good time . Then all of a sudden there was a snarl and a yowl , and that horrid great Bobs sprang over the fence and into the sand box , and began clawing and spitting and scratching right and left , just as hard as he could . At first the four friendly cats were too startled to do anything ; but in another minute they began to spit and scratch and claw , and there were all five of them rolling over and over , scattering the sand on every side , and making such a noise that it woke Johnny out of his sound sleep . At first he was frightened , but Maggie told him what it was , and said wait and see what she would do . She pushed up the fly screen very softly , and then she brought the great big jug full of water , and leaning out ,— splash ! she emptied it full on the fighting , struggling cats . Oh ! how they yelled ! One jumped this way , and one jumped that ; and the next moment not one was left except poor little Muffet , sitting in the middle of the box and crying pitifully . “ Oh , poor Muffy !” said Johnny . “ Poor Muffy all wet !” So then good Maggie ran down and brought Muffet up , and dried her with a towel , and comforted her till she purred . Johnny wanted to take her into bed with him , but Maggie said that never would do ; so ,— what do you think ? She put her in the doll ’ s cradle with Susan Dolly , and covered her up , and told her to go to sleep , and she did !</p>

    <head>“ Wake up !” said a clear little voice . Tommy woke , and sat up in bed . At the foot of the bed stood a boy about his own age , all dressed in white , like fresh snow . He had very bright eyes , and he looked straight at Tommy .</head>

   <p>“ Oh , must it ?” said Tommy . He felt frightened , and did not know just what to say .</p>
   <p>The boy nodded . “ If it does not stop ,” he said , “ you will grow worse and worse every year , till you grow up into a Horrid Man . Do you want to be a Horrid Man ?”</p>
   <p>“ N-no !” said Tommy .</p>
   <p>“ Then you must stop being a horrid boy !” said the New Year . “ Take your leaves !” and he held out a packet of what looked like copy-book leaves , all sparkling white , like his own clothes .</p>
   <p>“ Turn over one of these every day ,” he said , “ and soon you will be a good boy instead of a horrid one .”</p>
   <p>Tommy took the leaves and looked at them . On each leaf a few words were written . On one it said , “ Help your mother !” On another , “ Don ’ t pull the cat ’ s tail !” On another , “ Don ’ t eat so much !” And on still another , “ Don ’ t fight Billy Jenkins !”</p>
   <p>“ Oh !” cried Tommy . “ I have to fight Billy Jenkins ! He said —”</p>

   <p>“ My leaves ! My leaves !” cried Tommy ; and jumping out of bed he looked all over the room , but he could not find one .</p>

Then her mother kissed her , and said everybody had to turn over new leaves now , and she had some of her own to turn , so she knew just how it was . The door shut then — on the tip of my tail , too — and I heard no more ; but what do you suppose it means ?”</p>
   <p>Little Dog shook his head . “ We must ask somebody ,” he said . “ Let me see ! Great Old Dog is out for a walk , and Crosspatch Parrot bit me the last time I asked her a question .”</p>
   <p>“ I know ,” said Little Cat . “ We will ask Old Cat in the Barn . She knows a good many things , and if she isn ’ t catching rats — but she generally is — she will tell us .”</p>

   <p>They found Old Cat in the Barn sitting on a truss of hay , washing herself . She listened to Little Cat ’ s story , and her green eyes twinkled .</p>
   <p>“ So you have been looking for new leaves under the snow !” she said .</p>
   <p>“ Yes ,” said Little Cat . “ First I looked on the trees , and there weren ’ t any there ; so I thought it must be leaves of plants and things , so I scratched and dug till my poor paws were almost quite frozen , but not one single scrap of a leaf could I find .”</p>
   <p>“ Fffff !” said Old Cat in the Barn . “ This barn is full of ’ em !”</p>
   <p>“ Full of leaves !” cried Little Cat and Little Dog together . “ What can you mean , Old Cat ? We don ’ t call hay leaves !”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ How many rats have you caught this week ?” asked Old Cat , turning to</l>
     <l n="2">Little Dog .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ None !” said Little Dog . “ The last rat I caught bit me horridly ; besides , they are odious , vulgar beasts , and I don ’ t care to have anything to do with them .”</p>
   <p>“ Fffff !” said Old Cat . “ Little Cat , how many mice have you caught in the kitchen this week ?”</p>
   <p>Little Cat hung her head . “ I haven ’ t caught any ,” she said . “ I don ’ t care for mice , the flavor is too strong ; I like cream better .”</p>
   <p>“ Ffffff ! grrrr-yow !” said Old Cat ; her green eyes shot out sparks , and her fur began to stand up . “ Now , you two , listen to me ! Why do you think the Big People keep you ? Because you are soft and pretty and foolish ? Not at all ! They keep you because you are supposed to be useful . Your mother , Little Cat , was a hard-working , self-respecting mouser , who caught her daily mouse as regularly as she ate her daily bread and milk . Your father , Little Dog , hunted rats with me in this barn as long as he had legs to stand upon , and between us we kept the place in tolerable order . Great Old Dog cannot be expected to hunt at his age , and besides , he is too big ; one might as well hunt with an ox . But since your parents died you two lazy children have done next to nothing , and what is the consequence ? I am worked to skin and bone , and the mice are all over the house ; I heard Cook say so . Mind what I say ; no creature , with four legs or two , is worth his salt unless he earns it , in one way or another . Now , what have you to say for yourselves ?”</p>
   <p>“ Miaouw !” said Little Cat . “ I am very sorry , Old Cat .”</p>
   <p>“ Yap ! Yap !” said Little Dog . “ I am sorry too , Old Cat .”</p>
   <p>“ Very well !” said Old Cat in the Barn . “ Then turn over a new leaf !”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Miaouw !” “ Yap !” “ That is just what we want to do !” said Little Cat and</l>
     <l n="2">Little Dog together ; “ but we can ’ t find any .”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The fact is ,” said Old Cat in the Barn , “ it is one of the foolish ways of speaking that the Big People have . It just means , stop being bad and begin to be good . Now do you see ?”</p>
   <p>“ Prrr !” said Little Cat ; “ now I see . I will go and catch a mouse this minute , Old Cat .”</p>
   <p>“ Wuff !” said Little Dog ; “ I see , too , and I will come and hunt rats with you , Old Cat .”</p>
   <p>“ Prrrrrrr !” said Old Cat in the Barn . “ That is right ! Go to work , like good children , and as I may have been rather short with you lately I will turn over a new leaf , too , and ask you both to supper with me in my hay-parlor . Cook gave me the bones of the Christmas goose , and we will have a great feast .”</p>

    <head>NEW YEAR ’ S DAY IN THE WOOD</head>

     <l n="1">“ Do I look nice ?” asked the Rabbit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">“ Very nice !” said the Chipmunk ; “ that is , for a person who has no tail</l>
     <l n="3">to speak of . But , of course , you cannot help that .”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Rabbit looked into the looking-glass pond and saw his little white blob of a tail . “ Don ’ t you want to lend me yours , just this once ?” he asked . “ I would take great care of it !”</p>
   <p>“ No , I cannot do that ,” said the Chipmunk , “ but I can lend you the tail of my late uncle . It is such a fine one that we have kept it to brush out the nest with .”</p>
   <p>“ The very thing !” said the Rabbit .</p>
   <p>So the Chipmunk brought the tail of his late uncle and tied it on to the Rabbit ’ s stub .</p>
   <p>“ How does that look ?” asked the Rabbit .</p>
   <p>“ Fine !” said the Chipmunk . “ Now tell me how I look !”</p>
   <p>“ Well enough !” said the Rabbit . “ Of course , you would look better if you had long ears .”</p>
   <p>“ Dear me !” said the Chipmunk ; and he , too , looked into the looking-glass pond . “ Haven ’ t you a spare pair that you could lend me ?”</p>
   <p>“ Why , yes ,” said the Rabbit . “ There is a pair that belonged to my grandfather , hanging on the wall at home . I will get those .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>

   <p>So the Rabbit got the ears and tied them on to the Chipmunk ’ s head .</p>
   <p>“ How do I look now ?” asked the Chipmunk .</p>
   <p>“ Splendid !” said the Rabbit . “ Now let us go and make our New Year ’ s calls . Where shall we go first ?”</p>
   <p>“ I wish to call on Miss Woodchuck !” said the Chipmunk .</p>
   <p>“ So do I ,” said the Rabbit . “ We will go there first .” And off they went .</p>
   <p>They came to Miss Woodchuck ’ s door and knocked , and she opened the door . “ Mercy !” she cried . “ Who are you , and what do you want ?”</p>
   <p>“ We are Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Chipmunk ,” said the two friends , “ and we have come to make you a New Year ’ s call .”</p>
   <p>“ More likely you have come to steal the nuts !” said the lady angrily . “ I know Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Chipmunk well , and neither of you is either of them . Who ever heard of a long-tailed rabbit or a long-eared squirrel ? Get along with you ! You are frights , and probably thieves as well .” And she shut the door in their faces .</p>
   <p>The two friends walked a little way in silence ; then they stopped and looked at each other .</p>
   <p>“ You said I looked fine !” said the Rabbit .</p>
   <p>“ I — I meant the tail !” said the Chipmunk . “ It is a fine tail . But you said I looked splendid !”</p>
   <p>“ I was thinking of the ears !” said the Rabbit . “ They are splendid ears .”</p>
   <p>They walked on until they came once more to the looking-glass pond . They looked at themselves ; then they looked at each other ; then , all in a minute , off came the long ears and tail .</p>

    <head>THE BOASTFUL DONKEY</head>
     <l n="1">( Adapted )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Once upon a time there was a donkey who lived in a field where there was no pond ; so he had never seen his own image , and he thought he was the biggest and strongest and handsomest creature in the world .</p>
   <p>One day a lion came through the field , and , being a polite beast , stopped to greet the donkey . “ Good morning , friend !” he said . “ What a fine day this is !”</p>
   <p>“ Fine enough , I dare say !” said the donkey . “ I never think about the weather . I have other things to think about .”</p>
   <p>“ Indeed !” said the lion . “ May I ask what things ?”</p>
   <p>“ None of your business !” said the donkey rudely ; and he set up a loud braying , thinking to frighten the lion away .</p>
   <p>“ Why do you bray ?” asked the lion .</p>
   <p>“ Bray !” cried the donkey . “ That was not braying — it was roaring !”</p>
   <p>“ If you think I don ’ t know braying from roaring ,” said the lion , still politely , “ you are mistaken . That was a bray .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ Very well !” shouted the donkey . “ If that was , this shall not be !” and he uttered a long and loud “ Hee-haw !” and kicked up his heels in angry pride . “ What do you call that ?” he asked proudly .</p>
   <p>“ I call it a bray ,” replied the lion ; “ and a very ugly one . You see , after all , you are a donkey ; look at the length of your ears !”</p>
   <p>“ How dare you ?” cried the donkey . “ My ears are the finest in the world , everybody says so . And as for roaring , if I have not scared you yet , just listen to me now !” And flinging up his heels again he bellowed till his own long ears tingled with the sound .</p>
   <p>He expected the lion to be terrified , but the lion merely smiled .</p>
   <p>“ You certainly can make a most hideous noise ,” he said ; “ but when all is said and done , it is only a bray . If you really wish to know how a roar sounds I shall be happy to oblige you .”</p>
   <p>The King of Beasts then began to lash his tail and pretended to fall into a great passion . His eyes flashed fire , his tawny mane bristled ; he opened his great mouth , and a roar like thunder filled the air . The donkey , after one terrified look , took to his heels and scampered off as fast as he could go , tumbled into a ditch , and lay there all day , not daring to move for fear .</p>
   <p>The lion went on his way smiling . “ It is a pity ,” he said , “ for a person to live in a place where he cannot see what he looks like .”</p>

    <head>THE CAT ’ S NAME</head>
    <head>Tom had a cat who was so white that he named her Snow . He loved Snow and thought her the best cat in the world , but she would not come when she was called .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">One day Snow went and played in the coal-bin , and when she came out she</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ See , Mother ,” said Tom : “ Snow cannot be Snow now , for she is black .</l>
     <l n="4">What shall I name her ?”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ You might name her Soot !” said his mother .</l>

     <l n="6">So he named Snow Soot . Snow did not care , and Soot did not care , but</l>
     <l n="7">neither of them came when she was called .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>One day Snow saw a tin pot on the shed floor , and Soot thought there might be cream in it ; and Snow went to see , and Soot fell in , and it was green paint , and when she came out she was all green .</p>
   <p>“ See , Mother ,” said Tom . “ My cat is not white now , so she cannot be Snow , and she is not black , so she cannot be Soot . What shall I name her now ?”</p>
   <p>“ You might name her Grass ,” said his mother , “ till you have washed her ; but I would wash her soon if I were you .”</p>

   <p>So , Tom named the cat Grass . Snow did not care , and Soot did not care , and Grass did not care , but none of them came when they were called .</p>
   <p>“ How can I wash her ,” asked Tom , “ if she will not come when she is called ?”</p>
   <p>“ Let me try !” said his mother . So she called , “ Puss ! Puss ! Puss !” and the cat came running as fast as she could .</p>
   <p>“ Why-ee !” said Tom . “ I think her name must be Puss .”</p>
   <p>“ I think so , too ,” said his mother .</p>

   <p>JOHNNY ’ S RED SHOES AND WHITE STOCKINGS</p>
   <p>For every day , Johnny always wears blue ; blue rompers in the morning , when he is playing in the sand box or helping Maggie make bread in the kitchen , and a blue sailor suit in the afternoon , when he goes “ walk-a-walk-a ” with Mamma . But on Sunday afternoon he goes walk-a-walk-a with Daddy ( but they take Mamma too ! ) , and then he has on his white sailor suit , and his white stockings and red shoes . Aunt Kitty brought him the shoes , and when they came there was a china cat inside one , and a tin frog inside the other . They were surprises , the cat and the frog ; Aunt Kitty likes to give surprises .</p>
   <p>Well ! one Sunday morning Mamma and Daddy were going to church , and Maggie was very busy , so she put Johnny in the sand box , and told him to play like a good boy , and he did . He made two forts , one with the red tin pail and one with the blue tin pail ; and then he hammered on them with the old kitchen spoon and said , “ Bang ! bang ! bang !” and that made a battle . While he was having the battle , the Boy Over the Fence came and looked through the pickets , and said , “ Hurnh ! I ’ ve got new shoes on !” Johnny looked , and he had ; new brown shoes , that tied in front . So Johnny said : “ I have new shoes too , only they are not on ; they are up-stairs , and they are red .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ They ain ’ t !” said the Boy Over the Fence . He was not a very nice boy .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>“ HE HELD THEM UP SO THAT THE BOY OVER THE FENCE COULD SEE THEM .”</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ They are !” said Johnny . “ Bright red , with wankle buttons . Aunt Kitty bringed them , and there was a cat in one , and a frog in the other , and they were s ’ prises . And white stockings too , so there !” Then he stopped , for he was out of breath .</p>
   <p>“ Hurnh !” said the Boy Over the Fence . “ Let ’ s see ’ em !”</p>
   <p>Johnny trotted up the back stairs and brought down the white stockings and the red shoes ; they were laid out on the chair , with the white suit , all ready for him to put on . He held them up so that the Boy Over the Fence could see them , and said , “ So there !” again ; it was all he could think of to say .</p>
   <p>And the Boy Over the Fence said , “ Hurnh !” again , as if that was all he could think of to say .</p>
   <p>Just then Maggie opened the kitchen door and said : “ Come in this minute of time , Johnny boy , and get your luncheon ! see the nice cracker and the lovely mug of milk Maggie has for ye !”</p>
   <p>Johnny was hungry , and he dropped the red shoes and white stockings and ran in to have his luncheon . While he was eating it , Maggie told him the story of the Little Rid Hin ; ( Mamma says it is “ Red Hen ,” really , but Maggie always says it the other way , and Johnny likes it better ) ; and then she said it was time for his nap , and she whisked him up-stairs and tucked him up in his crib and told him to go to sleep like a good boy , and he went .</p>
   <p>By and by he woke up , and Mamma came in to dress him for dinner . She washed his face and hands , and brushed his hair , and put on his white sailor suit ; and then she said , “ Why , where ever are the shoes and stockings ?”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">She looked under the chair , and on the bureau , and under the bed .</l>
     <l n="2">“ Johnny ,” she said , “ I cannot find your red shoes and white stockings .</l>
     <l n="3">I put them here with your suit , and now they are gone .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">“ Oh !” said Johnny .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ Do you know where they are , dear ?” asked Mamma .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">“ Oh !” said Johnny again . “ I think — they are in — the sand box !”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="7">“ In the sand box !” said Mamma .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Boy Over the Fence said they wasn ’ t red ,” said Johnny ; “ and they was , and I gotted them and showed him , and then Maggie called me , and — and — I think that is all I know .”</p>
   <p>“ My goodness !” said Mamma . And she ran down-stairs and out into the yard to the sand box . But no red shoes or white stockings were there . Mamma looked all about carefully . There was the red tin pail , and the blue tin pail , both turned upside down , and the old kitchen spoon laid across them . And there were the marks of Johnny ’ s moccasins , and — oh ! there were the marks of another pair of shoes , a little bigger than Johnny ’ s , with heels to them .</p>
   <p>“ My goodness !” said Mamma . “ You don ’ t suppose —” but she did not say what you didn ’ t suppose .</p>
   <p>She looked over toward the next yard . There was no one there , but there were muddy footmarks leading from the fence to the sand box , and sandy footmarks leading back from the sand box to the fence .</p>
   <p>“ Now ,” said Mamma , “ I am afraid —” but she did not say what she was afraid of .</p>
   <p>Just as she was stepping out of the sand box , her foot struck against the red tin pail and knocked it over ; and — what do you think ? Inside of the pail was one red shoe and one white stocking .</p>
   <p>“ My goodness !” said Mamma again . Then she turned over the blue tin pail , and there was the other red shoe and the other white stocking .</p>
   <p>Mamma looked very severely over the fence , but no one was there ; so she took the shoes and stockings up-stairs and showed them to Johnny . “ Oh !” said Johnny .</p>
   <p>She told him where she had found them ; and then she put them away in the drawer , and brought out Johnny ’ s old brown moccasins and a pair of rather old brown stockings . “ You shall wear these to-day !” said Mamma .</p>
   <p>“ But why ?” said Johnny . “ I like my red shoes and white stockings best .”</p>
   <p>“ But you took them out and left them in the sand box !” said Mamma .</p>
   <p>“ But I did forget !” said Johnny .</p>
   <p>“ But this will help you to remember !” said Mamma .</p>
   <p>And it did .</p>

    <head>THE FOOLISH TORTOISE</head>
     <l n="1">( Adapted )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Close beside the Pool of the Blue Lotus lived the two geese White-Wings and Gray-Back , and in the pool lived the tortoise Shelly-Neck , and the three were good friends . One night Shelly-Neck heard two fishermen talking together beside the pool . “ To-morrow morning ,” they said , “ we will lay our nets and catch that old tortoise and cook him for our dinner .”</p>
   <p>Shelly-Neck was much frightened , and when the men were gone he called his friends the geese , and begged them to save him .</p>
   <p>“ We will save you ,” said White-Wings .</p>
   <p>“ But you must do just what we tell you to do !” said Gray-Back .</p>
   <p>“ I will ! I will !” cried poor Shelly-Neck .</p>
   <p>The two geese waddled about , looking till they found a stick . “ Now ,” said White-Wings , “ take this in your mouth and hold on tight !”</p>
   <p>“ And remember ,” said Gray-Back , “ that once you have taken hold you must not let go till we bid you .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The tortoise promised and took hold on the middle of the stick with his strong jaws . Then White-Wings took one end of the stick in his bill and Gray-Back took the other , and they flew high up in the air over the roofs of the houses .</p>
   <p>All the people came running to see this strange sight . “ Look ! look !” cried one . “ See the flying tortoise !”</p>
   <p>“ Ho !” said another , who was one of the fishermen . “ He has no wings ; soon he will forget and open his mouth , and then down he will come and we shall have him for dinner .”</p>

    <head>LITTLE CAT ’ S VALENTINE</head>
    <head>Great Old Dog was taking a nap before the parlor fire . He lay stretched out on the white bear skin , and reached almost from end to end , for he was a very great old dog indeed . By-and-by he woke up , and saw Little Dog sitting in front of him looking very melancholy .</head>

   <p>“ And you think two wrongs make a right ?” said Great Old Dog . “ They don ’ t . That is monkey arithmetic , not fit for respectable dogs and cats . My advice to you is to make it up as soon as you can .”</p>
   <p>“ But she says she will never speak to me again !” said Little Dog piteously .</p>
   <p>Great Old Dog yawned so wide that Little Dog could have got inside his mouth and turned around .</p>
   <p>“ She will !” he said .</p>
   <p>“ How do you know , Great Old Dog ?”</p>
   <p>“ Wuff ! I know cats .”</p>

   <p>“ Please let me out !” said Little Dog ; but she thought he said “ Yap !”</p>

   <p>Mamma looked , and then she took the dish in her hand and thought a minute . Mamma always likes to be sure about things before she says “ Yes !” for fear it might not really be “ yes ” after all . But now she nodded her head , and said , “ Yes , Johnny , you may have it .”</p>
   <p>“ O-oh !” said Johnny . “ For my welly own ?”</p>
   <p>“ For your very own . The rest of the set is broken , and I have just kept this dish because it is so pretty . Now you may take it down into the nursery , and have it for a bath for Flora .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>“ NOW HE GAVE HER ONE IN THE ROSY-POSY DISH .”</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Flora was a small doll , all china , and her clothes came off , so she could have a bath any time , and Johnny often gave her one . Now he gave her one in the rosy-posy dish , and it was just exactly the right size , and Johnny was so pleased , and said , “ Oh , thank you , dear Mamma !” without having to be told . ( Sometimes he forgets to say “ thank you ,” but he is getting to be quite good about it . )</p>
   <p>The next time Johnny went down-stairs , he took the doll ’ s bath to show to Maggie , and she said ’ twas the pick of the world for a dish , and asked Johnny to lave her bake a cake in it ; but Johnny said no , not now , though perhaps by and by , for now he must take it out to show to Muffy . Muffet was out in the sand-box , and when Johnny showed her the dish she mewed and rubbed against his legs , and seemed to want something very much .</p>
   <p>“ Maggie ,” said Johnny , “ Muffy wants something ! What do you suppose it is ?”</p>
   <p>“ Sure she might be wanting a sup o ’ milk !” said Maggie . “ Bring me here the grand dish and we ’ ll give the crature a sup in itself , and won ’ t she be the proud kitty !” that is the way Maggie talks ; it is a nice , funny way , Johnny thinks .</p>
   <p>Well ! so Maggie filled the pretty dish with milk , and Johnny set it down in the sand box before Muffet , and she lapped it up , every single drop , purring all the time . Johnny was watching her when Mamma called him in to take his nap . Muffet had not quite finished , so he left the dish standing , and ran in to Mamma , and then he went for his nap . When he woke up it was raining hard , and it rained all the afternoon , so he did not go out again , but stayed in the nursery building a Choo Choo House . The next morning was bright and clear , and the very first thing Johnny thought of , when he had had his bath , and Mamma was dressing him , was the rosy posy dish .</p>
   <p>“ I wants my diss ,” said Johnny , “ to give Flora her bath !”</p>
   <p>So Mamma looked for the dish , all over the nursery , but it was not to be found .</p>
   <p>“ Where did you leave it , Johnny Boy ?” said Mamma . “ Think a minute !”</p>
   <p>So Johnny thought a minute , and then he remembered . “ I left it in the sand box ,” he said . “ Muffy was very thirsty , and she was drinking out of it , and you called me , and she hadn ’ t finished , and so , you see — and so , you see —”</p>
   <p>And Mamma said she saw . Then she looked out of the window , and said yes , there was the dish , right in the sand box , beside the red tin pail and the blue tin pail and the old kitchen spoon . Then she said , “ Oh ! oh , Johnny , come here and look !”</p>
   <p>So Johnny went to the window , and stood on his tippy-toe-toes , and looked ; and what do you think he saw ? A little brown sparrow had come fluttering down , and was drinking out of the rosy posy dish . ( You see , it had rained all night , so the dish was full of water . ) He perched on the edge , and dipped his little beak in , and drank and drank ; he must have been very thirsty . And then — oh ! oh ! what did he do but hop down into the dish , and begin taking his bath ! He splashed , and he shook himself , and rustled his feathers , and then he splashed again . “ Oh !” said Johnny . “ Oh ! Mamma , he is doing it all himself . Nobody told him to , not one bit .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ No , indeed !” said Mamma . “ He likes to take his bath and be clean , just as Johnny does . He knows it feels good to be clean .”</p>
   <p>“ Mamma !” said Johnny . “ I want to tell you something . Shall we have something else for Flora , and let the rosy posy dish be the sparrow ’ s bath , his ownty donty ?”</p>
   <p>“ Suppose we do !” said Mamma . And they did .</p>

    <head>HOW MR. PEACOCK WENT TO THE FAIR</head>
     <l n="1">( Adapted )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Mr. Peacock was proud . He had a fine long train , a splendid crest , and the gayest blue-green coat that ever was seen ; and all day long he would strut up and down the barnyard and say : “ See what a beauty I am !”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The geese and ducks and turkeys were much displeased at this . “ Beauty , indeed !” they said . “ Of what use is your beauty ? Can it hatch eggs ? Tell us that !” and they turned their backs and walked away .</p>
   <p>“ These are stupid creatures !” said Mr. Peacock . “ Why should I stay among them ? I will go to the Fair , for there people will see my beauty and admire it .”</p>
   <p>So he spread his tail like a fan , raised his crested head and strutted off down the road to the Fair . Pretty soon he met some young men who also were going to the Fair . “ Aha !” said Mr. Peacock . “ These people will admire me !” and he strutted more than ever .</p>
   <p>“ Look !” said the young men . “ What a fine peacock , and what splendid feathers he has ! They are just what we want for our hats .” They surrounded Mr. Peacock , and , spite of his screams of rage and terror , tore out three or four of his finest tail feathers and went away laughing . Presently he fell in with a large flock of geese which a boy was driving to the Fair to sell . He spread his tail and tried to push his way to the head of the flock , but they took no notice of him and waddled steadily on , keeping close together .</p>
   <p>“ Make way , you stupid creatures !” said Mr. Peacock . “ Keep your dirty feet off my fine train !”</p>
   <p>“ Quack !” said an old gray goose , the grandmother of the flock . “ Keep your train out from under our feet , Mr. Strut ! Who asked you to join our company ?”</p>
   <p>“ Join your company , indeed !” cried Mr. Peacock . “ Get out of my way , you rude , clumsy thing , and learn how to treat your betters !” and he gave the goose a hard peck .</p>
   <p>When the other geese , who loved their grandmother , saw this , they all fell upon Mr. Peacock and beat and pecked and hustled him till he ran screaming away , dragging his tail behind him .</p>
   <p>He was now in a sad way , covered with dust , and many of his finest feathers were torn and broken ; but still , when he came to the Fair he spread his tail , reared his crest and made as much of himself as he could .</p>
   <p>“ I am still handsomer than any one else !” he said , “ and people will be sure to admire me .”</p>
   <p>“ Look there !” said a man . “ There is a peacock . Let us kill and stuff him and add him to our show .” And he chased Mr. Peacock , who ran off screaming with terror . Coming around a corner he ran into a large dog who was coming the other way .</p>
   <p>“ Get out of my way !” screamed Mr. Peacock .</p>
   <p>“ Get out of mine !” growled Mr. Dog , and he grabbed Mr. Peacock by the neck , shook him hard and tore out a great mouthful of feathers .</p>
   <p>More dead than alive , the poor Peacock ran and ran and ran , and never stopped till he got home .</p>
   <p>The geese and turkeys looked at him in great surprise . “ Who is this wretched , shabby bird ?” they asked each other . “ It cannot possibly be Mr. Peacock ?”</p>
   <p>“ Yes ,” sobbed the poor creature , “ it is I ; but I have left my pride behind . If you will only let me stay with you I will do my best to hatch eggs .”</p>
   <p>But he never could .</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">“ Where are you going in such haste , friend ?” said Trusty , the</l>
     <l n="3">shepherd ’ s Dog , to a great wolf that was jogging along the same road .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ If I were sure you would not betray my secret ,” said the Wolf , with a</l>

    </lg>

     <l n="6">“ You need not fear me ; I shall tell no one a word of the matter ,” said</l>
     <l n="7">Trusty .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Well , then ,” said the Wolf , “ you must know , as I was prowling around yonder cottage I saw the farmer ’ s wife put a fine baby into the cradle , and heard her say : ‘ Lie still , my darling , and go to sleep , while I run down to the village to buy bread for your father ’ s supper .’ As soon as the babe is asleep I shall go and fetch it : it is fair and fat , and will make a nice supper for me and my cubs .”</p>
   <p>“ Then ,” said Trusty , “ I would advise you to wait a little longer , for I saw the baby ’ s mother step into the next house to speak to a neighbor : take care lest you are seen .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The Wolf thanked the Dog for his good advice , for he did not know that the baby belonged to Trusty ’ s master ; and he said he would take heed and keep close .</p>
   <p>Then Trusty ran home with all the speed he could . The door was ajar , and the innocent baby was fast asleep in the cradle ; so he lay down on the mat behind the door and listened for the coming of the Wolf . It was not long before he heard the tread of the Wolf ’ s feet on the gravel path , and in another minute the savage beast was in the room and stealing with cautious steps to the cradle ; but just as he was preparing to seize the poor baby Trusty sprang upon him and after a fierce struggle laid him dead on the floor .</p>
   <p>The first thing the mother saw on her return was the Wolf dead at the foot of the cradle , while the baby , unhurt , lay soundly sleeping on his little pillow , and faithful Trusty watching beside him . She flew to look the little one all over , to make sure that he was safe and sound , and then , oh ! how she patted and fondled the good Dog who had saved her darling ’ s life ! She called in all the neighbors , and told them what Trusty had done , and from that time he became the pet of the whole village , and all the mothers wished they had such a dog to watch over their children .</p>

    <head>THE GRATEFUL CRANE</head>
     <l n="1">( Adapted )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Once a poor Crane was caught in a net , and could not get out . She fluttered and flapped her wings , but it was of no use , she was held fast .</p>
   <p>“ Oh !” she cried , “ what will become of me if I cannot break this net ? The hunter will come and kill me , or else I shall die of hunger , and if I die who will care for my poor little young ones in the nest ? They must perish also if I do not come back to feed them .”</p>
   <p>Now Trusty ( the same Trusty who saved the baby ’ s life ) was in the next field and heard the poor Crane ’ s cries . He jumped over the fence , and seizing the net in his teeth quickly tore it in pieces . “ There !” he said . “ Now fly back to your young ones , ma ’ am , and good luck to you all !”</p>
   <p>The Crane thanked him a thousand times . “ I wish all dogs were like you !” she said . “ And I wish I could do something to help you , as you have helped me .”</p>
   <p>“ Who knows ?” said Trusty . “ Some day I may need help in my turn , and then you may remember me . My old mother used to say to me :</p>

     <l n="4">Then Trusty went back to mind his master ’ s sheep , and Mrs. Crane flew</l>
     <l n="5">to her nest and fed and tended her crane babies .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Some time after this she was flying homeward and stopped at a clear pool to drink . As she did so she heard a sad , moaning sound , and looking about , whom should she see but good Trusty , lying on the ground , almost at the point of death . She flew to him . “ Oh , my good , kind friend ,” she cried , “ what has happened to you ?”</p>
   <p>“ A bone has stuck in my throat ,” said the Dog , “ and I am choking to death .”</p>
   <p>“ Now , thank Heaven for my long bill !” said Mrs. Crane . “ Open your mouth , good friend , and let me see what I can do .”</p>
   <p>Trusty opened his mouth wide ; the Crane darted in her long , slender bill , and with a few good tugs loosened the bone and finally got it out .</p>
   <p>“ Oh ! you kind , friendly bird !” cried the Dog , as he sprang to his feet and capered joyfully about . “ How shall I ever reward you for saving my life ?”</p>
   <p>“ Did you not save mine first ?” said Mrs. Crane . “ Shake paws and claws , friend Trusty ! I have only learned your mother ’ s lesson , which you taught me , that</p>

    <head>THE KING OF THE FEN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">( Adapted )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">“ I will be King of the Fen !” said Croaker the Frog , leaping out of the</l>
     <l n="3">brook upon the dry land .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ You King , indeed !” said Slyboots , a fine , fat Field Mouse with a long tail and bright eyes , jumping out of his hole at the foot of a hazel bush which grew near . “ I am larger than you , and I will be King , and the frogs shall be my subjects and cut rushes and bring me dry moss to line my nest .” And Slyboots strutted about and gave himself a great many airs .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ I will never consent to be ruled by a Mouse ,” replied the Frog with a disdainful air . “ How finely King Slyboots would sound !”</p>
   <p>“ Quite as well as King Croaker !” retorted the Mouse .</p>
   <p>Then the Frog flew into a great passion and hopped so high and croaked so loud that the Mouse crept a little farther from him ( for frogs , like children , look very ugly when they are out of temper ) ; and Slyboots did not much like the idea of being touched by his cold paws , and he said to himself : “ In spite of this Frog ’ s looking so fierce and talking so loud I should not wonder if he were a coward at heart .”</p>
   <p>So he turned to the Frog and said : “ As we both wish to be King of the Fen I know of no way of ending the dispute but by fighting , and the one that wins the fight shall be King over the other .”</p>
   <p>Then the Frog said : “ Very well ! We will each bring a friend to see fair play . To-morrow at twelve o ’ clock I shall be ready to take the field ; and if you fail to meet me here I shall be King of the Fen , and the mice shall be my servants .” For Croaker thought Slyboots was braver in word than in deed , as cowards are often the foremost to talk of fighting .</p>
   <p>Then the Frog retired among the bulrushes and the Mouse ran home to his hole under the nut tree .</p>
   <p>The two rivals awoke next morning by break of day to prepare for the combat , which was to take place at noon . The Frog was very much afraid of Slyboots ’ s sharp teeth and claws , so he fell to work and made a shield from the bark of an old willow tree , and then he plucked a long bulrush for a spear . “ Now ,” said he , “ I am well armed : I have a shield to defend myself and a spear to attack the enemy with . If I had but a brave friend to be my second in the fight I should do very well .”</p>
   <p>“ I will be your second ,” said a great Pike , raising his head above the water ; “ I will lie close to the bank among these rushes , and if you break your spear come to me and I will procure you another .”</p>
   <p>The Frog was well pleased at this offer . “ I shall beat Slyboots in a little time ,” said he , “ with such weapons and so good a friend .”</p>
   <p>Slyboots in the meantime was not idle ; he sharpened his teeth and his claws and chose a light twig from the hazel bush and said : “ I only want now a friend to be my second and see fair play .” A great Hawk , which was hovering near , said : “ Mr . Slyboots , you may command my services at any hour you please to name .”</p>
   <p>Now Slyboots was somewhat afraid of the Hawk , for he thought he had rather a hungry look about the eyes and beak , but he dared not refuse his offer lest he should give offence ; so he thanked him for his kindness , and at the appointed hour they went to the spot where the Frog was waiting for them . The Pike lay in the hole among the rushes and the Hawk sat on the bough of a tree close by .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>“ THE BATTLE WAS LONG AND FIERCE ON BOTH SIDES .”</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The Frog and the Mouse looked at one another for a few minutes and shook their weapons . At last the Hawk and the Pike gave signal for the fight to begin . The battle was long and fierce on both sides , and for some time it was doubtful which would win . At last the Frog seemed to gain ground , but at the very minute that he seemed to be winning his spear broke in pieces .</p>
   <p>“ Alas !” croaked he in a tone of dismay , “ what shall I do ? Who will give me another weapon ?”</p>
   <p>“ Here is one ,” cried his friend , the Pike , from among the rushes .</p>
   <p>The Frog gave a leap of joy and sprang toward the Pike , who , opening his mouth , quickly put an end to the battle by swallowing the hapless Frog at one mouthful .</p>
   <p>“ I am King of the Fen now !” cried Slyboots with a joyful squeak . “ Long live your Majesty !” exclaimed the crafty Hawk . As he spoke he darted from the tree and , pouncing upon the new monarch , bore him away in his claws and put an end to his reign and his life at the same moment .</p>

   <p>“ Te hee !” laughed the Maples and Birches and Ash trees , rustling their leaves and nodding their heads . “ She has but one dress ! What a poor thing she is !”</p>
   <p>But the old Pine waved his dark branches and said : “ Hush ! hush ! I know what I know !”</p>
   <p>“ We know , too ,” cried the Maples . “ We know that in snow-time Santa Claus comes , and chooses the finest tree , and dresses it in gold and silver and hangs stars all over it . That is why we wish to be fine and gay .”</p>
   <p>“ Hush ! hush !” said the old Pine . “ I know what I know .”</p>
   <p>So the trees put on their gay robes , gold and red and purple , and each one was finer than the rest ; only the little Fir and the great old Pine stayed just as they were , in their plain green dresses .</p>
   <p>Now it grew cold , and a bleak wind blew through the forest . The trees shivered and drew their bright robes close around them . Colder still it grew , and snow fell , and the wind moaned ; one day Jack Frost came in his silver coat and touched the bright leaves with his shining brush , and they curled up and turned brown , and , one by one , fell rustling to the ground . Soon the poor Maples and Birches and the purple Ash who thought he looked like a King stood all bare , and the wind blew through their branches , and they shook with the cold . They looked at the Fir and wished that they had her warm , green dress . Now came Santa Claus , driving his reindeer team through the forest , cracking his whip and jingling his bells . He looked at the trees with his bright eyes .</p>

   <p>“ Ho ! ho !” he said as he saw the Maples and Birches . “ What a beggarly set ! Why , they have not a cloak among them to keep them warm . These will never do for me .”</p>
   <p>But now he saw the little Fir , and a smile came over his face .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ This is the tree for me !” he cried . “ Will you come with me , little</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ That I will !” said the little Fir gladly .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So Santa Claus took her away and dressed her in gold and silver and hung bright stars all over her ; and she became the Christmas Tree , and many hearts were glad because of her .</p>
   <p>“ Hush ! hush !” said the old Pine . “ I knew what I knew .”</p>

    <head>THE DEER AND THE CROW</head>
     <l n="1">( Adapted )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Once upon a time in a deep wood lived a Deer and a Crow , who were great friends and loved each other dearly . One day , as the Deer was roaming about alone , he met Small-Wit , the Jackal .</p>
   <p>Small-Wit was hungry , and when he saw the fine fat Deer he said to himself : “ Oho ! if only I could have this fat Deer for my supper !” So he went up to the Deer , hanging his head and looking very sad .</p>
   <p>“ Who are you , Friend ?” asked the Deer , “ and why do you look so sad ?”</p>
   <p>“ My name is Small-Wit ,” said the Jackal ; “ and I am sad because I have not a friend in the world . Ah ! if I could win your friendship how happy I should be !”</p>
   <p>“ Very well ,” said the Deer , who was very good-natured . “ Come with me , and we will be friends .”</p>
   <p>He led the way to his home , and the Jackal followed him . As they drew near , Sharp-Sense , the Crow , called from the tree where he was perching : “ Who is this number two , Friend Deer ?”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ It is Small-Wit , the Jackal ,” said the Deer . “ He is lonely , and wishes to be our friend .”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="8">Next morning they went off hunting , and the Jackal said to the Deer : “ I</l>
     <l n="9">know a field of sweet corn , and I will take you there .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="10">So the Deer followed Small-Wit , and , sure enough , they came to a field</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="12">“ You are a friend indeed !” cried the Deer , and he feasted till suddenly</l>
     <l n="13">he fell into a snare which the farmer had laid .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Alas !” cried the Deer , “ Friend Small-Wit , here am I caught by the feet , and cannot move . Come , I pray you , and gnaw these cords with your sharp teeth and set me free !”</p>
   <p>The Jackal came and looked at the snare . “ That will hold you fast enough ,” he said . “ To-day is a fast day , but to-morrow I will have a fine feast on your fat carcass , my foolish friend .” And off he went .</p>
   <p>Presently came along Sharp-Sense , the Crow , who had been looking for his friend . “ Alas !” he cried , “ how did this happen , Friend Deer ?”</p>
   <p>“ Through not minding what you said ,” replied the Deer .</p>
   <p>“ Well ,” said the Crow , “ we must do what we can . Here comes the farmer . Do you lie still and pretend to be dead until I croak : then spring up and be off .”</p>
   <p>The farmer came along and saw our friend lying perfectly still . “ Aha !” he cried , “ this fellow will eat no more of my corn .”</p>
   <p>He stooped down and untied the cords of the snare , meaning to carry off the dead Deer ; but at that moment the Crow gave a loud “ Caw !” Up sprang the Deer and in a moment was safe in the forest . The farmer flung a club after him ; it hit Small-Wit , the Jackal , who was lurking near by hoping to have a share of the spoil , and killed him ; and the two friends went home happy .</p>

    <head>LITTLE GOLDSTAR</head>
     <l n="1">( Adapted )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In a southern garden lived a family of green lizards , under the roots of a palm-tree . They were merry little creatures , and their parents loved them dearly .</p>
   <p>One day Father Lizard said to his children : “ Your mother and I must go away this morning ; now be good children ; stay close together , and be sure that one of you keeps watch for fear of snakes and hawks !”</p>
   <p>The little lizards promised ; and for some time they were very careful ; first one kept watch , and then another ; but at length Sprightly said : “ There is no danger near . Why should we not all play together , just for a little while ?”</p>
   <p>Oh dear ! they forgot their promise , and see what came of it ! While they were playing merrily , a great snake glided quietly out from the grass , seized poor Sprightly , and carried her off to his den .</p>
   <p>The other lizards fled in terror . Swiftfoot ran up the tree , Longtail hid in the nest , and Goldstar ran away and away , to the farthest end of the garden . She did not dare to go home again , but found a hole in the bank near a summerhouse , and slipping into it , stayed all night , weeping for the death of her dear Sprightly .</p>
   <p>Next day she tried to find her way home , but the garden was large , and she was too afraid of snakes to go far ; so she decided to stay where she was , and make her home in the hole by the summerhouse .</p>
   <p>One day , as she was lying in the sun , Goldstar saw a boy standing near her , with a cane in his hand . At first she was afraid to move , fearing he might strike her ; but Carlos ( for that was the boy ’ s name ) was fond of lizards , and would not have hurt one for the world . He spoke softly to Goldstar , and she soon saw that he was kind and good . He stroked her gently , first with a green leaf , then with his hand , and Goldstar lay still , and was not afraid any more .</p>
   <p>They became great friends , and Carlos came every day to see his pretty lizard and play with her . One day , as he was coming down the garden walk , he saw a large hawk hovering in the air near the summerhouse , just about to dart down on something . “ Oh ! my lizard ! my lizard !” cried Carlos ; and he ran as fast as he could to the spot , shouting and waving his arms . The hawk flew screaming away , and Goldstar ran to Carlos , and crept inside his jacket . She could not speak , but he knew that she was glad , and perhaps was trying to thank him in her own way .</p>
   <p>One very hot day , Carlos was taking a nap in the summerhouse , when he was waked by something running over his face . He brushed it away without opening his eyes , but it came again , and still again . In fact , he could not get rid of it . At last he sat up , wide awake and very angry , and found that it was Goldstar . He tried to shake her off , but she ran into his bosom . He was going to pull her out in a pet , when , looking down , he saw a large snake , with head raised and glittering eyes , gliding slowly toward him . He knew its bite was fatal , and he sprang up with a loud cry . The snake stopped , and then turning , glided away into the bushes .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Very gently , Carlos drew his little pet from his bosom , and stroked her green and golden back . “ Dear Goldstar ,” he said , “ if I saved you from the hawk , you have saved me from the serpent . I will love you and take care of you as long as you live .” And so he did .</p>

    <head>THE CLEVER CROWS</head>
     <l n="1">( Adapted )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A pair of crows had their nest in a certain tree . It was a fine tree , and suited them well , but they had a bad neighbor , a black snake , who often stole and ate their young ones .</p>
   <p>“ Husband ,” said Mrs. Crow , “ we must leave this pleasant home of ours ; we shall never be able to rear our children while that bad snake is there .”</p>
   <p>“ My dear ,” replied Mr. Crow , “ think no more about him . I have had enough of Black Snake , and I am going to get rid of him .”</p>
   <p>“ What can you do against a huge snake like that ?” asked Mrs. Crow .</p>
   <p>“ Listen !” said Mr. Crow . “ As you know , the Prince comes every day to bathe in the fountain under our tree . He has a fine gold chain , and he takes it off before he goes into the water , and lays it on a stone . To-morrow , when he does this , do you take the chain in your beak ( for I shall be away getting food for the babies ) , and drop it into the hollow of the tree , taking care to give some good loud ‘ Caws ’ while you do so . Then wait and see what happens !”</p>
   <p>Sure enough , next morning the young Prince came as usual to bathe in the clear fountain . He took off his gold chain and laid it on a stone , just as Mr. Crow said he would ; then he began to take off his robes . Just then down flew Mrs. Crow , took the chain in her yellow bill , and flew up into the branches with it . “ Oh ! my chain ! my chain !” cried the Prince . “ That crow has flown away with it !”</p>
   <p>“ Have peace , your Highness !” replied his servant . “ The bird has not flown far ; she has this instant dropped the chain into a hole in the tree , and I will climb up and get it .”</p>
   <p>Up climbed the servant , and looked down into the hole .</p>
   <p>“ Do you see my chain ?” cried the Prince .</p>
   <p>“ Yes ,” said the servant , “ I see it , shining in the hole , but I see something else that is not so pretty ; the head of a great ugly black snake . If your Highness will throw me up a stone , I will kill the creature , for it is a poisonous snake .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>So the Prince threw up a stone , and the servant caught it , and killed the snake with it . Then he reached down into the hole , pulled out the gold chain , and took it back to his master , who thanked him kindly .</p>
   <p>“ Ah !” said Mrs. Crow . “ He is glad to get back his fine jewel ; but I am far happier , for I have my babies safe and sound . See what it is to have a clever husband ! I must be sure to have everything he likes best for supper to-night .”</p>
   <p>So she did ! I do not know what crows like best for supper , so I cannot tell you ; but they had a wonderful feast , and the little ones picked the bones , and there was no happier family in all the forest than the Crow Family .</p>

    <head>THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There are many old , old stories about the dear Christ Child when he was little . Not all of them are true , but all are sweet and lovely ; listen now , and you shall hear one .</p>
   <p>It had been raining in Nazareth , and the ground , which had long been parched and dry , was turned to wet clay . This was a wonderful thing for the children , and they all ran to play with the clay , just as you boys and girls do now . Some dug canals and wells , some built houses and towers ; while others took the soft clay in their hands and moulded it into shapes of men and animals . The little Jesus joined this last group , and while they made dogs and cats , horses and lions , he made little gray doves , and set them one by one on the edge of the fountain .</p>
   <p>Presently sweet Mary the Mother came to the door and looked out , to see what the children were doing .</p>
   <p>“ See !” cried one little boy . “ Mary Mother , see my dog ! he can almost wag his tail and bark .”</p>
   <p>“ Look at my lion !” cried another . “ He is so big and strong , he could eat up your dog in a minute .”</p>
   <p>“ Ho !” said a third . “ My man here could whip your dog , and kill your lion with his sword , so he is the best of all .”</p>
   <p>Mary Mother smiled , and praised the dog , the lion , and the man . Then she said , “ And what has my little Jesus to show me ?”</p>
   <p>“ I have made some little gray doves ,” said Jesus . “ See ! here they are !”</p>
   <p>“ And what can they do , my little one ?” asked sweet Mary , as she stroked the boy ’ s curly head .</p>
   <p>“ I think they can fly !” said little Jesus . “ Fly , pretty doves !”</p>
   <p>He clapped his hands , and up flew the doves like a soft gray cloud . Then fluttered round the child ’ s fair head , and lighted for a moment on his shoulders and his hands ; then they spread their gray wings and flew up into the sky , and were seen no more .</p>

    <head>“ What is going on to-day , Little Cat ?” asked Little Dog . “ Every one seems so happy and merry . I had chicken-bones for breakfast , with ever so much meat on them !”</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I had creamed fish ,” said Little Cat ; “ and it was real cream . Look !</l>
     <l n="2">Little Girl tied a red ribbon round my neck , and said I was a beauty .</l>

   <p>“ I have a new collar , you see ,” said Little Dog . “ And your girl has on a new blue dress , and my boy a velvet jacket . And they are not going to say one cross word all day ; I heard them tell their mother so .”</p>
   <p>“ I was in the nursery this morning ,” said Little Cat . “ The children ’ s stockings were full of toys and sugar-plums , and they kissed each other and said , ‘ Merry ’— something ! What can it all mean ?”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ Let us ask Great Old Dog !” said Little Dog . “ He knows almost everything , and he can surely tell us .”</p>
   <p>Great Old Dog was asleep , but he woke up and heard their story patiently . “ It was ‘ Merry Christmas !’ that the children said ,” he told them . “ This is Christmas Day .”</p>
   <p>“ What does it mean ?” asked Little Cat .</p>
   <p>“ I don ’ t understand all about it ,” said Great Old Dog ; “ but it is the best day in the whole year , for everybody is happy and kind , and tries to do pleasant things for everybody else . I think some one was born who brought kindness into the world .”</p>
   <p>“ Well ,” said Little Dog ; “ if everybody is going to be good we must be good , too . Little Cat , I will not growl at you once to-day , even if they put our dinner on the same plate !”</p>
   <p>“ Nor I at you ,” said Little Cat , “ even if there is only one cushion by the fireside .”</p>
   <p>“ Nice Little Cat !” said Little Dog .</p>
   <p>“ Good Little Dog !” said Little Cat .</p>
   <p>Just then in came Little Girl in her blue dress and Little Boy in his velvet jacket . “ Merry Christmas !” they cried : “ Little Cat and Little Dog , and dear , good Great Old Dog !”</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Dear ,” said his mother , “ I have no money . We are very poor , and I can</l>
     <l n="4">hardly buy food for us all .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Jack hung his head ; if he had not been ten the tears would have come to</l>
     <l n="6">his eyes , but he was ten .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">“ All the other boys give presents !” he said .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ So shall you !” said his mother . “ All presents are not bought with money . The best boy that ever lived was as poor as we are , and yet he was always giving .”</p>
   <p>“ Who was he ?” asked Jack ; “ and what did he give ?”</p>
   <p>“ This is his birthday ,” said the mother . “ He was the good Jesus . He was born in a stable , and he lived in a poor workingman ’ s house . He never had a penny of his own , yet he gave twelve good gifts every day . Would you like to try his way ?”</p>
   <p>“ Yes !” cried Jack .</p>
   <p>So his mother told him this and that ; and soon after Jack started out , dressed in his best suit , to give his presents .</p>
   <p>First , he went to Aunt Jane ’ s house . She was old and lame and she did not like boys .</p>
   <p>“ What do you want ?” she asked as she opened the door .</p>
   <p>“ Merry Christmas !” said Jack . “ May I stay for an hour and help you ?”</p>
   <p>“ Humph !” said Aunt Jane . “ Want to keep you out of mischief , do they ? Well ! you may bring in some wood .”</p>
   <p>“ Shall I split some kindling , too ?” asked Jack .</p>
   <p>“ If you know how !” said Aunt Jane . “ I can ’ t have you cutting your foot and messing my clean shed all up .”</p>
   <p>Jack found some fresh pine wood and a bright hatchet , and he split up a great pile of kindling and thought it fun . He stacked it neatly , and then he brought in a pail of water and filled the kettle .</p>
   <p>“ What else can I do ?” he asked . “ There are twenty minutes more .”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ Humph !” said Aunt Jane . “ You might feed the pig .”</p>
   <p>Jack fed the pig , who thanked him in his own way .</p>
   <p>“ Ten minutes more !” he said . “ What shall I do now ?”</p>
   <p>“ Humph !” said Aunt Jane . “ You may sit down and tell me why you came .”</p>
   <p>“ It is a Christmas present !” said Jack . “ I am giving hours for presents . I had twelve , but I gave one to Mother , and another one was gone before I knew I had it . This hour was your present .”</p>
   <p>“ Humph !” said Aunt Jane . She hobbled to the cupboard and took out a small round pie that smelt very good . “ Here !” she said . “ This is your present , and I thank you for mine . Come again , will you ?”</p>
   <p>“ Indeed I will !” said Jack , “ and thank you for the pie !”</p>
   <p>Next Jack went and read for an hour to old Mr. Green , who was blind . He read a book about the sea , and they both liked it very much , so the hour went quickly . Then it was time to help Mother get dinner , and then time to eat it ; that took two hours , and Aunt Jane ’ s pie was wonderful . Then Jack took the Smith baby for a ride in its carriage , as Mrs. Smith was ill , and they met its grandfather , who filled Jack ’ s pockets with candy and popcorn and invited him to a Christmas Tree that night .</p>
   <p>Next Jack went to see Willy Brown , who had been ill for a long time and could not leave his bed . Willy was very glad to see him ; they played a game , and then each told the other a story , and before Jack knew it the clock struck six .</p>
   <p>“ Oh !” cried Jack . “ You have had two !”</p>
   <p>“ Two what ?” asked Willy .</p>
   <p>“ Two hours !” said Jack ; and he told Willy about the presents he was giving . “ I am glad I gave you two ,” he said , “ and I would give you three , but I must go and help Mother .”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , dear !” said Willy . “ I thank you very much , Jack . I have had a perfectly great time , and it has driven the pain away ; but I have nothing to give you .”</p>
   <p>Jack laughed . “ Why , don ’ t you see ,” he cried , “ you have given me just the same thing ? I have had a great time , too .”</p>
   <p>“ Mother ,” said Jack as he was going to bed , “ I have had a splendid Christmas , but I wish I had had something to give you besides the hours .”</p>
   <p>“ My darling ,” said his mother , “ you have given me the best gift of all , yourself !”</p>

    <head>PUSSY AND DOGGY</head>
    <head>Pussy White and Doggy Brown were in the yard one day . Doggy Brown thought he would like to go into the house , so he went to the door , but it was shut . He tried to open it by bumping against it , but in vain . Then he barked , but no one heard him . Then he felt very sad , and sat down by the door and howled .</head>

   <p>DICK ’ S FAMILY</p>
   <p>Now this is true , for we saw it with our eyes . Dick was a bachelor , or so we had always supposed : a large black bachelor , with bright green eyes , and a very fine tail . He lived in the kitchen , and managed things pretty much as he pleased . When Peter , the new puppy , came he thought it would be fun to tease Dick . Dick thought it would be fun to be teased , and when he had sent Peter yelping and ki-yi-ing out into the shed , he sat and purred and blinked his green eyes , and thought the world a pleasant place .</p>
   <p>Now one day we looked out of the south parlor window , and what do you think we saw ? Dick was coming across the lawn looking very proud and very happy . Every now and then he stopped and looked over his shoulder and mewed as if he were calling some one to follow him . And some one was following him ! Across the lawn after him came :</p>
   <p>One very thin and wretched-looking tortoise-shell cat .</p>
   <p>One Maltese kitten .</p>
   <p>One yellow kitten .</p>
   <p>All three looked half-starved , and all three were scared out of their wits !</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ Come on !” said Dick , as plain as mew could speak . “ They won ’ t hurt you ; those are my people : they belong to me . Come on , I tell you !”</p>
   <p>They came on , though still very timidly , till they reached the barn . Then Dick took them under the barn and there he made them comfortable , we do not know just how , because we cannot get under the barn , and there they stayed . And when Dick came for his supper he said to Maggie as plain as mew could speak , “ Please feed my family , too !” and Maggie did .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">That was a year ago . Now the tortoise-shell cat is dead , but the</l>
     <l n="2">Maltese kitten and the yellow kitten are large and handsome cats , and</l>
     <l n="3">Dick still sits by the fire and purrs , and blinks his large green eyes .</l>
