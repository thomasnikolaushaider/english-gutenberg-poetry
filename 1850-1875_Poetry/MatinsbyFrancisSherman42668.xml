       <l n="15">With the mind and the will to cross the new-born waters</l>

       <l n="3">He knew she came from some far place ;</l>
       <l n="4">For when she threw her body down ,</l>
       <l n="5">She seemed quite tired ; and her face</l>
       <l n="6">Had dust upon it ; and her gown ,</l>
       <l n="7">That had been yellow , now was brown .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">She lay near where the shadows lie</l>
       <l n="9">At noontime when they meet the sun .</l>
       <l n="10">The water floated slowly by</l>
       <l n="11">Her feet . Her hair was all undone ,</l>
       <l n="12">And with the grass its gold was spun .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">The trees were tall and green behind ,</l>
       <l n="14">And hid the house upon the hill .</l>
       <l n="15">This place was sheltered from the wind ,</l>
       <l n="16">And all the little leaves were still ,</l>
       <l n="17">And every fern and daffodil .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="18">Her face was hidden in her hands ;</l>
       <l n="19">And through the grass , and through her hair ,</l>
       <l n="20">The sunlight found the golden bands</l>
       <l n="21">About her wrists . ( It was aware ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="23">From his high branch , the Kingfisher</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">He wondered who that she could be ,—</l>

       <l n="28">And why her days were wearisome ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="30">Her home must be far off indeed ,</l>

       <l n="38">To make them cry , “ We yield ! we yield</l>

      <head>TE DEUM LAUDAMUS</head>
       <l n="1">I will praise God alway for each new year ,</l>
       <l n="2">Knowing that it shall be most worthy of</l>
       <l n="3">His kindness and His pity and His love</l>
       <l n="4">I will wait patient , till , from sphere to sphere ,</l>
       <l n="5">Across large times and spaces , ringeth clear</l>
       <l n="6">The voice of Him who sitteth high above ,</l>
       <l n="7">Saying , “ Behold ! thou hast had pain enough ;</l>
       <l n="8">Come ; for thy Love is waiting for thee here ! ”</l>
       <l n="9">I know that it must happen as God saith .</l>
       <l n="10">I know it well . Yet , also , I know well</l>
       <l n="11">That where birds sing and yellow wild-flowers dwell ,</l>
       <l n="12">Or where some strange new sunset lingereth ,</l>
       <l n="13">All Earth shall alway of her presence tell</l>
       <l n="14">Who liveth not for me this side of death .</l>
