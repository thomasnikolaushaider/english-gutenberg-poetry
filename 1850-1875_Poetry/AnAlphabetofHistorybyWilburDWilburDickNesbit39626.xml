     <l n="2">Alexander the Great was a victim of fate ,</l>
     <l n="3">And he sighed there was naught to delight him</l>
     <l n="4">When he brandished his sword and defiantly roared</l>
     <l n="5">And could not get a country to fight him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">All the armies he 'd chased , all the lands laid to waste ,</l>
     <l n="7">And he clamored for further diversions ;</l>
     <l n="8">And our history speaks of his grip on the Greeks</l>
     <l n="9">And his hammerlock hold on the Persians .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Though the Gordian knot , cut in two , in a spot</l>
     <l n="11">In his palace was labeled a relic ,</l>
     <l n="12">Though Bucephalus , stuffed , gave him fame , he was huffed —</l>
     <l n="13">He was grouchy and grumpy , was Aleck .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">And the cause of his woe , he would have you to know ,</l>
     <l n="15">Was the fact that he never was able</l>
     <l n="16">To conduct a big scrap that a versatile chap</l>
     <l n="17">Of a war correspondent would cable .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">‘ Stead of being quite glad , he would grow very sad</l>
     <l n="19">When he told of the fellows who 'd fought him ,</l>
     <l n="20">As he thought of the lack of the clicking kodak</l>
     <l n="21">In the hands of a man to “ snapshot ” him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">We are told that he wept , and in dolefulness crept</l>
     <l n="23">Through his palace — the reason is hinted :</l>
     <l n="24">There were not at that time magazines for a dime ,</l>
     <l n="25">And his articles could not be printed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">Though it may seem unkind , ere his life we 've outlined ,</l>
     <l n="27">We must say in some ways he was hateful ;</l>
     <l n="28">And in truth , we have heard he went back on his word ,</l>

     <l n="2">When Christopher Columbus stood the egg upon its end ,</l>
     <l n="3">He solved a weighty problem that no one could comprehend —</l>
     <l n="4">Perhaps it was the puzzle whose solution clearly showed</l>
     <l n="5">The psychologic motives of the hen that crossed the road .</l>
     <l n="6">Perhaps cold storage minstrels never might have heard of this</l>
     <l n="7">If it had n't been for Chris .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Columbus packed his little grip and got upon the train</l>
     <l n="9">And went to see that noble man , King Ferdinand of Spain .</l>
     <l n="10">Result : He found America — oh , do not idly nod ,</l>
     <l n="11">For if it had n't been for this we could n't go abroad !</l>
     <l n="12">Just think of all the travel and the voyages we 'd miss</l>
     <l n="13">If it had n't been for Chris .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">Columbus found America and won a lot of fame —</l>
     <l n="15">Nobody ever thought to ask him how he knew its name ;</l>
     <l n="16">Nobody ever booked him for some lectures to declare</l>
     <l n="17">In eloquent assertions how he knew the land was there .</l>
     <l n="18">Today we might be savages , unknowing modern bliss ,</l>

     <l n="20">He landed near Havana , and he said : “ It seems to me</l>
     <l n="21">That sometime in the future little Cuby shall be free . ”</l>
     <l n="22">His vision was prophetic — far adown the future 's track</l>
     <l n="23">He saw the dauntless Hobson and the sinking Merrimac .</l>
     <l n="24">We might have still been tyros in the ethics of the kiss</l>

     <l n="26">Today there are big cities and big buildings named for him ,</l>
     <l n="27">And yet he was so poor that once he thought he 'd have to swim</l>
     <l n="28">To find this wondrous country , for he was so badly broke ;</l>
     <l n="29">But Isabella nobly put her watch and ring in soak .</l>
     <l n="30">Who knows but Isabella never might have thought of this</l>

     <l n="9">Were sure to start some quarrels .</l>
     <l n="10">In fact , his tub became a booth</l>

     <l n="16">He seldom left his narrow home —</l>

     <l n="18">The only time that he would roam</l>
     <l n="19">Abroad was on a Monday .</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">Society , with all its sham ,</l>
     <l n="23">Gave him a paroxysm ;</l>
     <l n="24">He always spoke in epigram</l>
     <l n="25">And thought in aphorism .</l>
     <l n="26">One day he took his lantern down</l>
     <l n="27">And polished it and lit it —</l>
     <l n="28">But first he frowned a peevish frown</l>
     <l n="29">And growled : “ The wick do n't fit it . ”</l>
     <l n="30">And then , with pessimistic scan ,</l>
     <l n="31">He sought to find an honest man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="32">Diogenes has long been dead ;</l>
     <l n="33">His search was not well heeded ,</l>
     <l n="34">For no historian has said</l>
     <l n="35">If ever he succeeded .</l>
     <l n="36">But there 's this thought for you and me :</l>
     <l n="37">It would not be quite pleasant</l>
     <l n="38">If on that quest the sage should be</l>
     <l n="39">With his fierce light , at present .</l>
     <l n="40">For , if he were , one may but think</l>
     <l n="41">How much that light would make him blink .</l>

     <l n="26">In fact , his works could have been played</l>

     <l n="28">He never used the soubrette maid</l>
     <l n="29">Or based his play on show girls ;</l>
     <l n="30">And , this for old Euripides :</l>
     <l n="31">In none of all his dramas</l>

     <l n="34">Euripides was Athens ’ Fitch</l>

   <p>Hippocrates was father to an awful lot of bother , for ‘ tis claimed that as to medicine he was the pioneer , That but for him the surgeon or the latter-day chirurgeon might never have been tinkering the human running gear .</p>
   <p>Hippocrates ’ diploma never threw him into coma in his efforts to decipher what its classic diction said , For when he was seeking practice — long ago — the simple fact is that the Latin tongue was common and was very far from dead .</p>
   <p>He often growled , “ Dad gum it ! ” when he felt the glossy summit of his head , which was as bald as any shiny billiard ball — But old Hip had to endure it , for he knew he could n't cure it , and that once his hair was falling , why , he had to let it fall .</p>
   <p>He was written up by Plato ( who was quite a hot potato when it came to mental effort , for you know he reasoned well ) ; Plato praised his diagnosis , called him healing 's patient Moses , and though facts were hard to gather , found a goodly lot to tell .</p>
   <p>Hippocrates had knowledge , though he did n't go to college ; he could speak of all diseases that he knew , in Latin terms ( Still , ‘ twas only second nature to affect that nomenclature ) , but he never even thought of , much less heard of , any germs .</p>
   <p>Streptococcus or bacillus such as get in us and kill us to Hippocrates were always undiscovered and unknown , And the grim appendicitis which today is sure to fright us , was by Dr. Hip considered but a stomach-achic groan .</p>
   <p>Were he living at this moment , would the world be in a foment ? Would physicians of the present take him out to see the town ? From New Jersey clear to Joppa not a one would call him “ Papa , ” and his theories and treatments would be greeted with a frown .</p>
   <p>We must say that he was clever , and that in one way , however , he resembled all the others who are treating human ills — He was constantly complaining that in spite of all his training he could never cure his patients of the trait of dodging bills .</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Xantippe was the lady who was wed to Socrates —</l>
     <l n="3">And their life was not a grand , sweet song ;</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Twas a study — just a study — done in all the minor keys</l>
     <l n="5">With the gloomy measures turned on strong .</l>
     <l n="6">When old Socrates was busy at the office , she would wait</l>
     <l n="7">Till he ambled in at 3 a. m .</l>
     <l n="8">And she met him in the moonlight ‘ twixt the doorway and the gate —</l>
     <l n="9">Then the neighbors heard a lot from them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">But Socrates — he did n't mind when she pulled out his hair ,</l>
     <l n="11">When she would box his ears for him he did n't seem to care —</l>
     <l n="12">In a manner bland and wise</l>
     <l n="13">He would then philosophize</l>
     <l n="14">On the Whyness of the Whichness of the Neither Here Nor There .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="15">Xantippe did the cooking , and ( we have to tell the truth ) —</l>
     <l n="16">Indigestion quickly seized on him ,</l>
     <l n="17">And in one of her biscuits on a time he broke a tooth ,</l>
     <l n="18">Yet he smiled across at wifey grim .</l>
     <l n="19">When she tried her hand at pastry was the only time he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="20">And of course he had to make a break —</l>
     <l n="21">‘ Twas perhaps the first appearance of the ever-lasting joke</l>
     <l n="22">On the pies that mother used to make .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="23">Poor Socrates ! He never even ducked his head or dodged</l>
     <l n="24">But merely rubbed the spot whereon the flying platter lodged ,</l>
     <l n="25">Then he murmured : “ Xanty , dear ,</l>
     <l n="26">You have made a problem clear ” —</l>
     <l n="27">Then he went to get the swelling on his cranium massaged .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="28">Xantippe would n't let him smoke at all about the place ,</l>
     <l n="29">And she would n't let him take a drink .</l>
     <l n="30">He never learned the value of a two-spot or an ace —</l>
     <l n="31">For ‘ most all that he could do was think .</l>
     <l n="32">Thus you see that though Xantippe has been fiercely criticized ,</l>
     <l n="33">Yet she really made her husband 's fame ,</l>
     <l n="34">For ‘ twas while she bossed him sorely that the great man analyzed</l>
     <l n="35">All the subjects that have made his name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="36">Xantippe made him famous ; but for her the man had been</l>
     <l n="37">Forgotten like the others of the time that he lived in .</l>
     <l n="38">“ Oh , my darling , such a help ! ”</l>
     <l n="39">He most gratefully would yelp</l>
     <l n="40">When she gave him an impression with a busy rolling-pin .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Zenobia was empress of the people of Palmyra ;</l>
     <l n="3">She tried to boss the army when she should have stayed at home .</l>
     <l n="4">Aurelian , the soldier , led a sort of a hegira</l>
     <l n="5">Of armies up to fight her — they came all the way from Rome .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Full soon he was pursuing them , with spears and daggers “ shooing ” them ,</l>
     <l n="7">At last he sent them to defeat and caught the doughty queen .</l>
     <l n="8">He captured her regretfully , he said , but she said fretfully</l>
     <l n="9">That she considered him a spiteful thing , and very , very “ mean . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">He led her back a captive with her hands in jeweled fetters ,</l>
     <l n="11">Though she cast on Aurelian a look of proud disdain ;</l>
     <l n="12">Her manacles were carved and chased and decked by jewel setters ,</l>
     <l n="13">And to securely hold her he had made a golden chain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">There is a lot of mystery connected with all history —</l>
     <l n="15">Zenobia , they tell us , did n't want to go to jail ,</l>
     <l n="16">But , think of such a fate as that ! Why , such a jeweled weight as that</l>
     <l n="17">Was better than to pawn your clothes and be released on bail !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">Zenobia was taken to the royal Roman palace</l>
     <l n="19">And there the charming prisoner , we read , was quite the rage —</l>
     <l n="20">Had she lived in this time of ours ( we say this without malice ) ,</l>
     <l n="21">She might have made a lasting hit by going on the stage .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">Aurelian was nice to her — he hinted more than twice to her</l>
     <l n="23">That he was getting pretty tired of kinging it alone .</l>
     <l n="24">You see , she might have captured him — already she enraptured him —</l>
     <l n="25">And had that handcuff jewelry to wear upon the throne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">But , no ! Zenobia was like ‘ most any other lady —</l>
     <l n="27">They 've been the same since mother Eve ; they have the same way still :</l>
     <l n="28">No matter if it 's Princess May , or Susie , Sal or Sadie ,</l>
     <l n="29">No lady will consent to be convinced against her will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">At last they told her civilly , “ You 'll have to live in Tivoli ”</l>
     <l n="31">( Which may or may not be the way to speak that city 's name ) .</l>
     <l n="32">She answered very prettily : “ I 'll love to live in Italy ” —</l>
     <l n="33">And there she stayed until she was an old , forgotten dame .</l>
