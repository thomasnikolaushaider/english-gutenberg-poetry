    <p n="1">And one , perchance , will read and sigh : “ What aimless songs ! Why will he sing Of nature that drags out her woe Through wind and rain , and sun , and snow , From miserable spring to spring ? ” Then put me by .</p>
    <p n="2">And one , perhaps , will read and say : “ Why write of things across the sea ; Of men and women , far and near , When we of things at home would hear — Well , who would call this poetry ? ” Then toss away .</p>
    <p n="3">A hopeless task have we , meseems , At this late day ; whom fate hath made Sad , bankrupt heirs of song ; who , filled With kindred yearnings , try to build A tower like theirs , that will not fade , Out of our dreams .</p>

   <p>The Brothers</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Not far from here , it lies beyond</l>
     <l n="2">That low-hilled belt of woods . We 'll take</l>
     <l n="3">This unused lane where brambles make</l>
     <l n="4">A wall of twilight , and the blond</l>
     <l n="5">Brier-roses pelt the path and flake</l>
     <l n="6">The margin waters of a pond .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">This is its fence — or that which was</l>
     <l n="8">Its fence once — now , rock rolled from rock ,</l>
     <l n="9">One tangle of the vine and dock ,</l>
     <l n="10">Where bloom the wild petunias ;</l>
     <l n="11">And this its gate , the iron-weeds block ,</l>
     <l n="12">Hot with the insects ’ dusty buzz .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Two wooden posts , wherefrom has peeled</l>
     <l n="14">The weather-crumbled paint , still rise ;</l>
     <l n="15">Gaunt things — that groan when someone tries</l>
     <l n="16">The gate whose hinges , rust-congealed ,</l>
     <l n="17">Snarl open :— on each post still lies</l>
     <l n="18">Its carven lion with a shield .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">We enter ; and between great rows</l>
     <l n="20">Of locusts winds a grass-grown road ;</l>
     <l n="21">And at its glimmering end ,— o'erflowed</l>
     <l n="22">With quiet light ,— the white front shows</l>
     <l n="23">Of an old mansion , grand and broad ,</l>
     <l n="24">With grave Colonial porticoes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Grown thick around it , dark and deep ,</l>
     <l n="26">The locust trees make one vast hush ;</l>
     <l n="27">Their brawny branches crowd and crush</l>
     <l n="28">Its very casements , and o'ersweep</l>
     <l n="29">Its rotting roofs ; their tranquil rush</l>
     <l n="30">Haunts all its spacious rooms with sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Still is it called The Locusts ; though</l>
     <l n="32">None lives here now . A tale 's to tell</l>
     <l n="33">Of some dark thing that here befell ;</l>
     <l n="34">A crime that happened years ago ,</l>
     <l n="35">When by its walls , with shot and shell ,</l>
     <l n="36">The war swept on and left it so .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">For one black night , within it , shame</l>
     <l n="38">Made revel , while , all here about ,</l>
     <l n="39">With prayer or curse or battle-shout ,</l>
     <l n="40">Men died and homesteads leapt in flame :</l>
     <l n="41">Then passed the conquering Northern rout ,</l>
     <l n="42">And left it silent and the same .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">Why should I speak of what has been ?</l>
     <l n="44">Or what dark part I played in all ?</l>
     <l n="45">Why ruin sits in porch and hall</l>
     <l n="46">Where pride and gladness once were seen ;</l>
     <l n="47">And why beneath this lichened wall</l>
     <l n="48">The grave of Margaret is green .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">Heart-broken Margaret ! whose fate</l>
     <l n="50">Was sadder yet than his who won</l>
     <l n="51">Her hand — my brother Hamilton —</l>
     <l n="52">Or mine , who learned to know too late ;</l>
     <l n="53">Who learned to know , when all was done ,</l>
     <l n="54">And nothing could exonerate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">To expiate is still my lot ,—</l>
     <l n="56">And , like the Ancient Mariner ,</l>
     <l n="57">To show to others how things are</l>
     <l n="58">And what I am , still helps me blot</l>
     <l n="59">A little from that crime 's red scar ,</l>
     <l n="60">That on my soul is branded hot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">He was my only brother . She</l>
     <l n="62">A sister of my brother 's friend .</l>
     <l n="63">They met , and married in the end .</l>
     <l n="64">And I remember well when he</l>
     <l n="65">Brought her rejoicing home , the trend</l>
     <l n="66">Of war moved towards us sullenly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">And scarce a year of wedlock when</l>
     <l n="68">Its red arms took him from his bride .</l>
     <l n="69">With lips by hers thrice sanctified</l>
     <l n="70">He left to ride with Morgan 's men .</l>
     <l n="71">And I — I never could decide —</l>
     <l n="72">Remained at home . It happened then .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="73">For days went by . And , oft delayed ,</l>
     <l n="74">A letter came of loving word</l>
     <l n="75">Scrawled by some camp-fire , sabre-stirred ,</l>
     <l n="76">Or by a pine-knot 's fitful aid ,</l>
     <l n="77">When in the saddle , armed and spurred</l>
     <l n="78">And booted for some hurried raid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="79">Then weeks went by . I do not know</l>
     <l n="80">How long it was before there came ,</l>
     <l n="81">Blown from the North , the clarion fame</l>
     <l n="82">Of Morgan , who , with blow on blow ,</l>
     <l n="83">Had drawn a line of blood and flame</l>
     <l n="84">From Tennessee to Ohio .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="85">Then letters ceased ; and days went on .</l>
     <l n="86">No word from him . The war rolled back ,</l>
     <l n="87">And in its turgid crimson track</l>
     <l n="88">A rumor grew , like some wild dawn ,</l>
     <l n="89">All ominous and red and black ,</l>
     <l n="90">With news of our lost Hamilton ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="91">That hinted death or capture . Yet</l>
     <l n="92">No thing was sure ; till one day ,— fed</l>
     <l n="93">By us ,— some men rode up who said</l>
     <l n="94">They 'd been with Morgan and had met</l>
     <l n="95">Disaster , and that he was dead ,</l>
     <l n="96">My brother .— I and Margaret</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="97">Believed them . Grief was ours too :</l>
     <l n="98">But mine was more for her than him ;</l>
     <l n="99">Grief , that her eyes with tears were dim ;</l>
     <l n="100">Grief , that became the avenue</l>
     <l n="101">For love , who crowned the sombre brim</l>
     <l n="102">Of death 's dark cup with rose-red hue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="103">In sympathy ,— unconsciously</l>
     <l n="104">Though it be given — I hold , doth dwell</l>
     <l n="105">The germ of love that time shall swell</l>
     <l n="106">To blossom . Sooner then in me —</l>
     <l n="107">When close relations so befell —</l>
     <l n="108">That love should spring from sympathy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="109">Our similar tastes and mutual bents</l>
     <l n="110">Combined to make us intimates</l>
     <l n="111">From our first meeting . Different states</l>
     <l n="112">Of interest then our temperaments</l>
     <l n="113">Begot . Then friendship , that abates</l>
     <l n="114">No love , whose self it represents .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="115">These led to talks and dreams : how oft</l>
     <l n="116">We sat at some wide window while</l>
     <l n="117">The sun sank o'er the hills ’ far file ,</l>
     <l n="118">Serene ; and of the cloud aloft</l>
     <l n="119">Made one vast rose ; and mile on mile</l>
     <l n="120">Of firmament grew sad and soft .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="121">And all in harmony with these</l>
     <l n="122">Dim clemencies of dusk , afar</l>
     <l n="123">Our talks and dreams went ; while the star</l>
     <l n="124">Of evening brightened o'er the trees :</l>
     <l n="125">We spoke of home ; the end of war :</l>
     <l n="126">We dreamed of life and love and peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="127">How on our walks in listening lanes</l>
     <l n="128">Or confidences of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="129">We paused to hear the dove that cooed ;</l>
     <l n="130">Or gathered wild-flowers , taking pains</l>
     <l n="131">To find the fairest ; or her hood</l>
     <l n="132">Filled with wild fruit that left deep stains .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="133">No echo of the drum or fife ,</l>
     <l n="134">No hint of conflict entered in</l>
     <l n="135">Our thoughts then . Will you call it sin —</l>
     <l n="136">Indifference to a nation 's strife ?</l>
     <l n="137">What side might lose , what side might win ,</l>
     <l n="138">Both immaterial to our life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="139">Into the past we did not look ;</l>
     <l n="140">Beyond what was we did not dream ;</l>
     <l n="141">While onward rushed the thunderous stream</l>
     <l n="142">Of war , that , in its torrent , took</l>
     <l n="143">One of our own . No crimson gleam</l>
     <l n="144">Of its wild course around us shook .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="145">At last we knew . And when we learned</l>
     <l n="146">How he had fallen , Margaret</l>
     <l n="147">Wept ; and , albeit my eyes were wet ,</l>
     <l n="148">Within my soul I half discerned</l>
     <l n="149">A joy that mingled with regret ,</l>
     <l n="150">A grief that to relief was turned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="151">As time went on and confidence</l>
     <l n="152">Drew us more strongly each to each ,</l>
     <l n="153">Why did no intimation reach</l>
     <l n="154">Its warning hand into the dense</l>
     <l n="155">Soul-silence , and confuse the speech</l>
     <l n="156">Of love 's unbroken eloquence !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="157">But , no ! no hint to turn the poise ,</l>
     <l n="158">Or check the impulse of our youth ;</l>
     <l n="159">To chill it with the living truth</l>
     <l n="160">As with the awe of God 's own voice ;</l>
     <l n="161">No hint , to make our hope uncouth ;</l>
     <l n="162">No word , to warn us from our choice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="163">To me a wall seemed overthrown</l>
     <l n="164">That social law had raised between ;</l>
     <l n="165">And o'er its ruin , broad and green</l>
     <l n="166">A path went , I possessed alone ;</l>
     <l n="167">The sky above seemed all serene ;</l>
     <l n="168">The land around seemed all my own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="169">What shall I say of Margaret</l>
     <l n="170">To justify her part in this ?</l>
     <l n="171">That her young heart was never his ?</l>
     <l n="172">But had been mine since first we met ?</l>
     <l n="173">So would you say !— Enough it is</l>
     <l n="174">That when he left she loved him yet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="175">So passed the Spring , and Summer sped ;</l>
     <l n="176">And early Autumn brought the day</l>
     <l n="177">When she her hand in mine should lay ,</l>
     <l n="178">And I should take her hand and wed .</l>
     <l n="179">And still no hint that might gainsay ,</l>
     <l n="180">No warning word of quick or dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="181">The day arrived ; and , with it born ,</l>
     <l n="182">A battle , sullying the East</l>
     <l n="183">With boom of cannon , that increased ,</l>
     <l n="184">And throb of musket and of horn :</l>
     <l n="185">Until at last , towards dusk , it ceased ;</l>
     <l n="186">And men with faces wild and worn ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="187">In fierce retreat swept past ; now groups ;</l>
     <l n="188">Now one by one ; now sternly white ,</l>
     <l n="189">Or blood-stained ; now with looks whose fright</l>
     <l n="190">Said all was lost . Then sullen troops</l>
     <l n="191">That , beaten , still kept up the fight .</l>
     <l n="192">Then came the victors ; shadowy loops</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="193">Of men and horse , that left a crowd</l>
     <l n="194">Of officers in hall and porch ....</l>
     <l n="195">While through the land around the torch</l>
     <l n="196">Circled , and many a fiery cloud</l>
     <l n="197">Marked out the army 's iron march</l>
     <l n="198">In furrows red , that pillage plowed ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="199">Here we were wedded .— Ask the years</l>
     <l n="200">How such could be , while over us</l>
     <l n="201">A sword of wrath swung ominous ,</l>
     <l n="202">And on our cheeks its breath was fierce !</l>
     <l n="203">All I remember is — ‘ twas thus ,</l>
     <l n="204">And Margaret 's eyes were wet with tears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="205">No other cause my memory sees</l>
     <l n="206">Save this , that night was set ; and when</l>
     <l n="207">I found my home filled with armed men</l>
     <l n="208">With whom were all my sympathies</l>
     <l n="209">Of Union — why postpone it then ?</l>
     <l n="210">So argued conscience into peace .</l>

      <l n="746">I met him here at Ammendorf one Spring .</l>
      <l n="747">It was the end of April and the Harz ,</l>
      <l n="748">Veined to their ruin-crested summits , seemed</l>
      <l n="749">One pulse of tender green and delicate gold ,</l>
      <l n="750">Beneath a heaven that was like the face</l>
      <l n="751">Of girlhood waking into motherhood .</l>
      <l n="752">Along the furrowed meadow , freshly ploughed ,</l>
      <l n="753">The patient oxen , loamy to the knees ,</l>
      <l n="754">Plodded or lowed or snuffed the fragrant soil ;</l>
      <l n="755">And in each thorntree hedge the wild bird sang</l>
      <l n="756">A song to Spring , made of its own wild heart</l>
      <l n="757">And soul , that heard the dairy-maiden May 's</l>
      <l n="758">Heart beating like a star at break of day ,</l>
      <l n="759">As , kissing ripe the blossoms , she drew near ,</l>
      <l n="760">Her mouth 's sweet rose all dew-drops and perfume .</l>
      <l n="761">Here at this inn and underneath this tree</l>
      <l n="762">We took our wine , the morning prismed in its</l>
      <l n="763">Flame-angled gold .— A goodly vintage that !</l>
      <l n="764">Tang with the ripeness of full twenty years .</l>
      <l n="765">Rare ! I remember !— wine that spurred the blood ,</l>
      <l n="766">That brought the heart glad to the limbered lip ,</l>
      <l n="767">And made the eyes unlatticed casements where</l>
      <l n="768">A man 's true soul you could not help but see .</l>
      <l n="769">As royal a Rhenish , I will vouch to say ,</l>
      <l n="770">As that , old legends tell , which Necromance</l>
      <l n="771">And Magic keep , gnome-guarded , in huge casks</l>
      <l n="772">Of antique make deep in the Kyffhaeuser ,</l>
      <l n="773">The Cellar of the Knights near Sittendorf .—</l>
      <l n="774">So solaced of that wine we sat an hour .</l>
      <l n="775">He told me his intent in coming here .</l>
      <l n="776">His name was Rudolf ; and his native home ,</l>
      <l n="777">Franconia ; but no word of parentage :</l>
      <l n="778">Only his mind to don the buff and green</l>
      <l n="779">And live a forester with us and be</l>
      <l n="780">Enfellowed in the Duke of Brunswick 's train ,</l>
      <l n="781">And for the Duke 's estate even now was bound .</l>
      <l n="782">Tall was he for his age and strong and brown ,</l>
      <l n="783">And lithe of limb ; and with a face that seemed</l>
      <l n="784">Hope 's counterpart — but with the eyes of doubt ;</l>
      <l n="785">Deep restless disks , instinct with gleaming night ,</l>
      <l n="786">That seemed to say , “ We 're sure of earth , at least</l>
      <l n="787">For some short space , my friend ; but afterward —</l>
      <l n="788">Nay ! ransack not to-morrow till to-day ,</l>
      <l n="789">Lest it engulf thy joy before it is ! ” —</l>
      <l n="790">And when he spoke , the fire in his eyes</l>
      <l n="791">Worked stealthy as a hunted animal 's ;</l>
      <l n="792">Or like the Count von Hackelnburg 's that turn ,</l>
      <l n="793">Feeling the unseen presence of a fiend .</l>
      <l n="794">Then , as it chanced , old Kurt had come that morn</l>
      <l n="795">With some six of his jerkined foresters</l>
      <l n="796">From the Thuringian forest ; wet with dew ,</l>
      <l n="797">And fresh as morn with early travel ; bound</l>
      <l n="798">For Brunswick , Dummburg and the Hakel passed .</l>
      <l n="799">Chief huntsman he then to our lord the Duke ,</l>
      <l n="800">And father of the loveliest maiden here</l>
      <l n="801">In Ammendorf , the sunny Ilsabe :</l>
      <l n="802">Her mother dead , the gray-haired father prized</l>
      <l n="803">His daughter more than all that men hold dear ;</l>
      <l n="804">His only happiness , who was beloved</l>
      <l n="805">Of all as Lora of Thuringia was ,</l>
      <l n="806">For gentle ways that spoke a noble soul ,</l>
      <l n="807">Winning all hearts to love her and to praise ,</l>
      <l n="808">As might a great and beautiful thought that holds</l>
      <l n="809">Us by the simplest words .— Her eyes were blue</l>
      <l n="810">As the high influence of a summer day .</l>
      <l n="811">Her hair ,— serene and braided over brows</l>
      <l n="812">White as a Harz dove 's wing ,— was auburn brown ,</l>
      <l n="813">And deep as mists the sun has drenched with gold .</l>
      <l n="814">And her young presence — well , ‘ t was like a song ,</l>
      <l n="815">A far Tyrolean melody of love ,</l>
      <l n="816">Heard on an Alpine path at close of day</l>
      <l n="817">When shepherds homeward lead their tinkling flocks .</l>
      <l n="818">And when she left , being with you awhile ,—</l>
      <l n="819">How shall I say it ?— ‘ t was as when one hath</l>
      <l n="820">Beheld an Undine by the moonlit Rhine ,</l>
      <l n="821">Who , ere the mind adjusts a thought , is gone ,</l>
      <l n="822">And in your soul you wonder if a dream .</l>
      <l n="823">Some thirty years ago it was ;— and I ,</l>
      <l n="824">Commissioner of the Duke — ( no sinecure</l>
      <l n="825">I can assure you ) — had scarce reached the age</l>
      <l n="826">Of thirty ,— that we sat here at our wine ;</l>
      <l n="827">And ‘ t was through me that Rudolf ,— whom at first ,</l>
      <l n="828">From some rash words dropped then in argument ,</l>
      <l n="829">The foresterhood was like to be denied ,—</l>
      <l n="830">Was then enfellowed . “ Yes , ” said I , “ he 's young .</l>
      <l n="831">Kurt , he is young ; but see , a wiry frame ;</l>
      <l n="832">A chamois footing and a face for deeds ;</l>
      <l n="833">An eye that likes me not ; too quick to turn ;</l>
      <l n="834">But that may be the restless soul within ;</l>
      <l n="835">A soul perhaps with virtues that have been</l>
      <l n="836">Severely tried and could not stand the test ;</l>
      <l n="837">These be thy care , Kurt ; and if not too deep</l>
      <l n="838">In vices of the flesh , discover them ,</l>
      <l n="839">As divers bring lost riches up from ooze .</l>
      <l n="840">Thou hast a daughter ; let him be thy son . ”</l>
      <l n="841">A year thereafter was it that I heard</l>
      <l n="842">Of Rudolf 's passion for Kurt 's Ilsabe ;</l>
      <l n="843">Then their betrothal . And it was from this ,—</l>
      <l n="844">Good Mother Mary ! how she haunts me still !</l>
      <l n="845">Sweet Ilsabe ! whose higher womanhood ,</l>
      <l n="846">True as the touchstone which philosophers feign</l>
      <l n="847">Transmutes to gold base metals it may touch ,</l>
      <l n="848">Had turned to good all evil in this man ,—</l>
      <l n="849">Surmised I of the excellency which</l>
      <l n="850">Refinement of her purer company ,</l>
      <l n="851">And contact with her innocence , had resolved</l>
      <l n="852">His fiery nature to , conditioning slave .</l>
      <l n="853">And so I came from Brunswick — as , you know ,</l>
      <l n="854">Is custom of the Duke or , by his seal</l>
      <l n="855">Commissioned proxy , his commissioner —</l>
      <l n="856">To test the marksmanship of Rudolf , who</l>
      <l n="857">Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child ,</l>
      <l n="858">An heir of Kuno .— He ?— Greatgrandfather</l>
      <l n="859">Of Kurt ; and of this forestkeepership</l>
      <l n="860">The first possessor ; thus established here —</l>
      <l n="861">Or this the tale they tell on winter nights :</l>
      <l n="862">Kuno , once in the Knight of Wippach 's train ,</l>
      <l n="863">Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke , who came ,—</l>
      <l n="864">Grandfather of the father of our Duke ,—</l>
      <l n="865">With much magnificence of knights and squires ,</l>
      <l n="866">Great velvet-vestured nobles , cloaked and plumed ,</l>
      <l n="867">To hunt Thuringian deer . Then morn ,— too quick</l>
      <l n="868">To bid good-morrow ,— was too slow for these ,</l>
      <l n="869">And on the wind-trod hills recumbent yawned</l>
      <l n="870">Disturbed an hour too soon ; all sleepy-eyed ,</l>
      <l n="871">Like some young milkmaid whom the cock hath roused ,</l>
      <l n="872">Who sits and rubs stiff eyes that still will close .</l>
      <l n="873">Horns sang and deer-hounds tugged a whimpering leash ,</l>
      <l n="874">Or , loosened , bounded through the baying glens :</l>
      <l n="875">And ere the mountain mists , compact of white ,</l>
      <l n="876">Broke wild before the azure spears of day ,</l>
      <l n="877">The far-off hunt , that woke the woods to life ,</l>
      <l n="878">Seemed but the heart-beat of the ancient hills .</l>
      <l n="879">And then , near noon , within a forest brake ,</l>
      <l n="880">The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag ,</l>
      <l n="881">Lashed to whose back with gnarly-knotted cords ,</l>
      <l n="882">And borne along like some pale parasite ,</l>
      <l n="883">A man shrieked : tangle-bearded , and wild hair</l>
      <l n="884">A mane of forest-burs . The man himself ,</l>
      <l n="885">Emaciated and half-naked from</l>
      <l n="886">The stag 's mad flight through headlong rocks and trees ,</l>
      <l n="887">One bleeding bruise , with eyes like holes of fire .</l>
      <l n="888">For such the law then : when the peasant chased</l>
      <l n="889">Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords ,</l>
      <l n="890">If seized , as punishment the withes and spine</l>
      <l n="891">Of some strong stag , a gift to him of game ,</l>
      <l n="892">Enough till death — death in the antlered herd ,</l>
      <l n="893">Or slow starvation in the haggard hills .</l>
      <l n="894">Then was the great Duke glad , and forthwith cried</l>
      <l n="895">To all his hunting train a rich reward</l>
      <l n="896">For him who slew the stag and saved the man ,</l>
      <l n="897">But death for him who slew both man and stag .</l>
      <l n="898">So plunged the hunt after the hurrying slot ,</l>
      <l n="899">A shout and glimmer through the sounding woods ,—</l>
      <l n="900">Like some mad torrent that the hills have loosed</l>
      <l n="901">With death for goal .— ‘ T was late ; and none had risked</l>
      <l n="902">That shot as yet ,— too desperate the risk</l>
      <l n="903">Beside the poor life and a little gold ,—</l>
      <l n="904">When this young Kuno , with fierce eyes , wherein</l>
      <l n="905">Hunt and impatience kindled reckless flame ,</l>
      <l n="906">Cried , “ Has the dew then made our powder wet ?</l>
      <l n="907">Or have we left our marksmanship at home ?</l>
      <l n="908">Here 's for its heart ! the Fiend direct my ball ! ” —</l>
      <l n="909">And fired into a covert deeply packed ,</l>
      <l n="910">An intertangled wall of matted night ,</l>
      <l n="911">Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive</l>
      <l n="912">To pierce one fathom , earn one foot beyond .</l>
      <l n="913">But , ha ! the huge stag staggered from the brake</l>
      <l n="914">Hit full i ’ the heart . And that wan wretch , unbound ,</l>
      <l n="915">Was ta'en and cared for . Then his grace , the Duke ,</l>
      <l n="916">Charmed with the eagle aim , called Kuno up ,</l>
      <l n="917">And there to him and his forever gave</l>
      <l n="918">The forestkeepership .</l>
      <l n="919">But envious tongues</l>
      <l n="920">Were soon at wag ; and whispered went the tale</l>
      <l n="921">Of how the shot was free , and how the balls</l>
      <l n="922">Used by young Kuno were free bullets — which</l>
      <l n="923">To say is : Lead by magic moulded , in</l>
      <l n="924">The influence and directed , of the Fiend .</l>
      <l n="925">Of some effect these tales , and had some force</l>
      <l n="926">Even with the Duke , who lent an ear so far</l>
      <l n="927">As to ordain Kuno 's descendants all</l>
      <l n="928">To proof of skill ere their succession to</l>
      <l n="929">The father 's office . Kurt himself hath shot</l>
      <l n="930">The silver ring out o ’ the popinjay 's beak —</l>
      <l n="931">A good shot he , you see , who would succeed .</l>
      <l n="932">Of these enchanted bullets let me speak :</l>
      <l n="933">There may be such ; our Earth has things as strange ,</l>
      <l n="934">Perhaps , and stranger , that we doubt not of ,</l>
      <l n="935">While we behold , not only ‘ neath the thatch</l>
      <l n="936">Of Ignorance 's hovel , but within</l>
      <l n="937">The pictured halls of Wisdom 's palaces ,</l>
      <l n="938">How Superstition sits an honored guest .</l>
      <l n="939">A cross-way let it be among the hills ;</l>
      <l n="940">A cross-way in a solitude of pines ;</l>
      <l n="941">And on the lonely cross-way you must draw</l>
      <l n="942">A blood-red circle with a bloody sword ;</l>
      <l n="943">And round the circle , runic characters ,</l>
      <l n="944">Gaunt and satanic ; here a skull , and there</l>
      <l n="945">A scythe and cross-bones , and an hour-glass here ;</l>
      <l n="946">And in the centre , fed with coffin-wood ,</l>
      <l n="947">Stol'n from the grave of one , a murderer ,</l>
      <l n="948">A smouldering fire . Eleven of the clock</l>
      <l n="949">The first ball leaves the mold — the sullen lead</l>
      <l n="950">Mixed with three bullets that have hit their mark ,</l>
      <l n="951">And blood , the wounded Sacramental Host</l>
      <l n="952">Stolen , and hence unhallowed , oozed , when shot</l>
      <l n="953">Fixed to a riven pine . Ere twelve o'clock</l>
      <l n="954">With never a word until that hour sound ,</l>
      <l n="955">Must all the balls be cast ; and these must be</l>
      <l n="956">In number three and sixty ; three of which</l>
      <l n="957">The Fiend 's dark agent , demon Sammael ,</l>
      <l n="958">Claims for his master and stamps for his own</l>
      <l n="959">To hit aside their mark , askew for harm .</l>
      <l n="960">The other sixty shall not miss their mark .</l>
      <l n="961">No cry , no word , no whisper , even though</l>
      <l n="962">Vague , gesturing shapes , that loom like moonlit mists ,</l>
      <l n="963">Their faces human but with animal forms ,</l>
      <l n="964">Rise thick around and threaten to destroy .</l>
      <l n="965">No cry , no word , no whisper should there come ,</l>
      <l n="966">Weeping , a wandering shadow like the girl</l>
      <l n="967">You love , or loved , now lost to you , her eyes</l>
      <l n="968">Hollow with tears ; all palely beckoning</l>
      <l n="969">With beautiful arms , or censuring ; her face</l>
      <l n="970">Sad with a desolate love ; who , if you speak</l>
      <l n="971">Or waver from that circle — hideous change !—</l>
      <l n="972">Shrinks to a wrinkled hag , whose harpy hands</l>
      <l n="973">Shall tear you limb from limb with horrible mirth .</l>
      <l n="974">Nor be deceived if some far midnight bell</l>
      <l n="975">Strike that anticipated hour ; nor leave</l>
      <l n="976">By one short inch the circle , for , unseen</l>
      <l n="977">Though now they be , Hell 's minions still are there ,</l>

      <l n="994">And , spun a spiral spark into the night ,</l>
      <l n="995">Whistling the phantom flies and fades away .</l>
      <l n="996">Some say there comes no stage ; that Hackelnburg ,</l>
      <l n="997">Wild-huntsman of the Harz , comes dark as storm ,</l>
      <l n="998">With rain and wind and demon dogs of Hell ,</l>

      <l n="1004">And at the last , plutonian-cloaked , there comes ,</l>
      <l n="1005">Upon a stallion gaunt and lurid black ,</l>
      <l n="1006">The minister of Satan , Sammael ,</l>
      <l n="1007">Who greets you , and informs you , and assures .</l>
      <l n="1008">Enough ! these wives ’ - tales told , to what I 've seen :</l>
      <l n="1009">To Ammendorf I came ; and Rudolf here</l>
      <l n="1010">With Kurt and his assembled men , I met .</l>
      <l n="1011">The abundant year ,— like some sweet wife ,— a-smile</l>
      <l n="1012">At her brown baby , Autumn , in her arms ,</l>
      <l n="1013">Stood ‘ mid the garnered harvests of her fields</l>
      <l n="1014">Dreaming of days that pass like almoners</l>
      <l n="1015">Scattering their alms in minted gold of flowers ;</l>
      <l n="1016">Of nights , that forest all the skies with stars ,</l>
      <l n="1017">Wherethrough the moon — bare-bosomed huntress — rides ,</l>
      <l n="1018">One cloud before her like a flying fawn .</l>
      <l n="1019">Then I proposed the season 's hunt ; till eve</l>
      <l n="1020">The test of Rudolf 's skill postponed , at which</l>
      <l n="1021">He seemed impatient . And ‘ t was then I heard</l>
      <l n="1022">How he an execrable marksman was ;</l>
      <l n="1023">And tales that told of near , incredible shots ,</l>
      <l n="1024">That missed their mark ; or how his flint-lock oft</l>
      <l n="1025">Flashed harmless powder , while the curious deer</l>
      <l n="1026">Stood staring ; as in pity of such aim</l>
      <l n="1027">Bidding him try his marksmanship again .</l>
      <l n="1028">Howbeit , he that day acquitted him</l>
      <l n="1029">Of all this gossip ; in that day 's long hunt</l>
      <l n="1030">Missing no shot , however rashly made</l>
      <l n="1031">Or distant through the intercepting trees .</l>
      <l n="1032">And the piled , various game brought down of all</l>
      <l n="1033">Good marksmen of Kurt 's train had not sufficed ,</l>
      <l n="1034">Doubled , nay , trebled , there to match his heap .</l>
      <l n="1035">And marvelling the hunters saw , nor knew</l>
      <l n="1036">How to excuse them . My indulgence giv'n ,</l>
      <l n="1037">Some told me that but yesterday old Kurt</l>
      <l n="1038">Had made his daughter weep and Rudolf frown ,</l>
      <l n="1039">By vowing end to their betrothed love ,</l>
      <l n="1040">Unless that love developed better aim</l>
      <l n="1041">Against the morrow 's test ; his ancestors ’</l>
      <l n="1042">High fame should not be tarnished . So he railed ;</l>
      <l n="1043">And bowed his gray head and sat moodily ;</l>
      <l n="1044">But looking up , forgave all when he saw</l>
      <l n="1045">Tears in his daughter 's eyes and Rudolf gone</l>
      <l n="1046">Out in the night black with approaching storm .</l>
      <l n="1047">Before this inn , yonder and here , they stood ,</l>
      <l n="1048">The holiday village come to view the trial :</l>
      <l n="1049">Fair maidens and their comely mothers with</l>
      <l n="1050">Their sweethearts and their husbands . And I marked</l>
      <l n="1051">Kurt and his daughter here ; his florid face</l>
      <l n="1052">All jubilant at Rudolf 's great success ;</l>
      <l n="1053">Hers , radiant with happiness ; for this</l>
      <l n="1054">Her marriage eve — so had her father said —</l>
      <l n="1055">Should Rudolf come successful from the hunt .</l>
      <l n="1056">So pleased was I with what I 'd seen him do ,</l>
      <l n="1057">The trial of skill superfluous seemed , and so</l>
      <l n="1058">Was on the bare brink of announcing , when</l>
      <l n="1059">Out of the western heaven 's deepening red ,—</l>
      <l n="1060">Like a white message dropped by rosy lips ,—</l>
      <l n="1061">A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there ,</l>
      <l n="1062">Upon that limb , a peaceful moment sat .</l>
      <l n="1063">Then I , “ Thy rifle , Rudolf ! pierce its head ! ”</l>
      <l n="1064">Cried pointing , “ and chief-forester art thou ! ” —</l>
      <l n="1065">Why did he falter with a face as strange</l>
      <l n="1066">As a dark omen ? did his soul foresee</l>
      <l n="1067">What was to be with tragic prescience ?—</l>
      <l n="1068">What a bad dream it all seems now !— Again</l>
      <l n="1069">I see him aim . Again I hear the cry ,</l>
      <l n="1070">“ My dove ! O Rudolf , do not kill my dove ! ”</l>
      <l n="1071">And from the crowd , like some sweet dove herself ,</l>
      <l n="1072">A fluttering whiteness , came our Ilsabe —</l>
      <l n="1073">Too late ! the rifle cracked ... The unhurt dove</l>
      <l n="1074">Rose , beating frightened wings — but Ilsabe !...</l>
      <l n="1075">The sight ! the sight !... lay smitten ; a red stain ,</l>
      <l n="1076">Sullying the pureness of her bridal bodice ,</l>
      <l n="1077">Showed where the ball had pierced her through the heart .</l>
      <l n="1078">And Rudolf ?— Ah , of him you still would know ?—</l>
      <l n="1079">When he beheld this thing that he had done ,</l>
      <l n="1080">Why he went mad — I say — but others not .</l>
      <l n="1081">An hour he raved of how her life had paid</l>
      <l n="1082">For the unholy bullets he had used ,</l>
      <l n="1083">And how his soul was three times lost and damned .</l>

    <head>TO J . FOX , JR .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">You remember how the mist ,</l>
     <l n="2">When we climbed to Devil 's Den ,</l>
     <l n="3">Pearly in the mountain glen ,</l>
     <l n="4">And above us , amethyst ,</l>
     <l n="5">Throbbed or circled ? then away ,</l>
     <l n="6">Through the wildwoods opposite ,</l>
     <l n="7">Torn and scattered , morning-lit ,</l>
     <l n="8">Vanished into dewy gray ?—</l>
     <l n="9">Vague as in romance we saw ,</l>
     <l n="10">From the fog , one riven trunk ,</l>
     <l n="11">Talon-like with branches shrunk ,</l>
     <l n="12">Thrust a monster dragon claw .</l>
     <l n="13">And we climbed for hours through</l>
     <l n="14">The dawn-dripping Jellicoes ,</l>
     <l n="15">To a wooded rock that shows</l>
     <l n="16">Undulating leagues of blue</l>
     <l n="17">Summits ; mountain-chains that lie</l>
     <l n="18">Dark with forests ; bar on bar ,</l>
     <l n="19">Ranging their irregular</l>
     <l n="20">Purple peaks beneath a sky</l>
     <l n="21">Soft as slumber . Range on range</l>
     <l n="22">Billow their enormous spines ,</l>
     <l n="23">Where the rocks and priestly pines</l>
     <l n="24">Sit eternal , without change .</l>
     <l n="25">We were sons of Nature then :</l>
     <l n="26">She had taken us to her ,</l>
     <l n="27">Signalized by brier and burr ,</l>
     <l n="28">Something more to her than men :</l>
     <l n="29">Pupils of her lofty moods ,</l>
     <l n="30">From her bloom-anointed looks ,</l>
     <l n="31">Wisdom of no man-made books</l>
     <l n="32">Learned we in those solitudes :</l>
     <l n="33">How the seed supplied the flower ;</l>
     <l n="34">How the sapling held the oak ;</l>
     <l n="35">How within the vine awoke</l>
     <l n="36">The wild impulse still to tower ;</l>
     <l n="37">How in fantasy or mirth ,</l>
     <l n="38">Springing from her footsteps there ,</l>
     <l n="39">Curious fungi everywhere</l>
     <l n="40">Bulged , exuded from the earth ;</l>
     <l n="41">Coral vegetable things ,</l>
     <l n="42">That the underworld exhaled ,</l>
     <l n="43">Bulbous , crystal-ribbed and scaled ,</l>
     <l n="44">Many colored and in rings ,</l>
     <l n="45">Like the Indian-Pipe that grew</l>
     <l n="46">Pink and white in loamy cracks ,</l>
     <l n="47">Flowers of a natural wax ,</l>
     <l n="48">She had turned her fancy to .—</l>
     <l n="49">On that laureled precipice ,</l>
     <l n="50">Where the chestnuts dropped their burrs ,</l>
     <l n="51">Sweet with balsam of the firs ,</l>
     <l n="52">First we felt her mother kiss</l>
     <l n="53">Full of heaven and the wind ;</l>
     <l n="54">While the forests , wood on wood ,</l>
     <l n="55">Murmured like a multitude</l>
     <l n="56">Giving praise where none hath sinned .—</l>
     <l n="57">Freedom met us there ; we saw</l>
     <l n="58">Freedom giving audience ;</l>
     <l n="59">In her face the eloquence ,</l>
     <l n="60">Lightning-like , of love and law :</l>
     <l n="61">Round her , with majestic hips ,</l>
     <l n="62">Lay the giant mountains ; there</l>
     <l n="63">Near her , cataracts tossed their hair ,</l>
     <l n="64">God and thunder on their lips .—</l>
     <l n="65">Oft an eagle , or a hawk ,</l>
     <l n="66">Or a scavenger , we knew</l>
     <l n="67">Winged through altitudes of blue ,</l>
     <l n="68">By its shadow on the rock .</l>
     <l n="69">Or a cloud of templed white</l>
     <l n="70">Moved , a lazy berg of pearl ,</l>
     <l n="71">Through the sky 's pacific swirl ,</l>
     <l n="72">Shot with cool cerulean light .</l>
     <l n="73">So we dreamed an hour upon</l>
     <l n="74">That warm rock the lichens mossed ,</l>
     <l n="75">While around us foliage tossed</l>
     <l n="76">Coins , gold-minted of the sun :</l>
     <l n="77">Then arose ; and a ravine ,</l>
     <l n="78">Which a torrent once had worn ,</l>
     <l n="79">Made our roadway to the corn ,</l>
     <l n="80">In the valley , deep and green ;</l>
     <l n="81">And the farm house with its bees ,</l>
     <l n="82">Where old-fashioned flowers spun</l>
     <l n="83">Gay rag-carpets in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="84">Hid among the apple trees .</l>
     <l n="85">Here we watched the twilight fall ;</l>
     <l n="86">O'er WolfhYpppHeNMountain sunset made</l>
     <l n="87">A huge rhododendron rayed</l>
     <l n="88">Round the sun 's cloud-centered ball .</l>
     <l n="89">Then through scents of herb and soil ,</l>
     <l n="90">To the mining-camp we turned ,</l>
     <l n="91">In the twinkling dusk discerned</l>
     <l n="92">With its white-washed homes of toil .</l>
     <l n="93">Ah , those nights !— We wandered forth</l>
     <l n="94">On some haunted mountain path ,</l>
     <l n="95">When the moon was late , and rathe</l>
     <l n="96">The large stars , sowed south and north ,</l>
     <l n="97">Splashed with gold the purple skies ;</l>
     <l n="98">And the milky zodiac ,</l>
     <l n="99">Rolled athwart the belted black ,</l>
     <l n="100">Seemed a path to Paradise .</l>
     <l n="101">And we walked or lingered till ,</l>
     <l n="102">In the valley-land beneath ,</l>
     <l n="103">Like the vapor of a breath</l>
     <l n="104">Breathed in frost , arose the still</l>
     <l n="105">Architecture of the mist :</l>
     <l n="106">And the moon-dawn 's necromance</l>
     <l n="107">Touched the mist and made it glance</l>
     <l n="108">Like a town of amethyst .</l>
     <l n="109">Then around us , sharp and brusque ,</l>
     <l n="110">Night 's shrill insects strident strung</l>
     <l n="111">Instruments that buzzed and sung</l>
     <l n="112">Pixy music of the dusk .</l>
     <l n="113">And we seemed to hear soft sighs ,</l>
     <l n="114">And hushed steps of ghostly things ,</l>
     <l n="115">Fluttered feet or rustled wings ,</l>
     <l n="116">Moved before us . Fire-flies ,</l>
     <l n="117">Gleaming in the tangled glade ,</l>
     <l n="118">Seemed the eyes of warriors</l>
     <l n="119">Stealing under watching stars</l>
     <l n="120">To some midnight ambuscade ;</l>
     <l n="121">To the Indian village there ,</l>
     <l n="122">Wigwamed with the mist , that slept</l>
     <l n="123">By the woodland side , whence crept</l>
     <l n="124">Shadowy Shawnees of the air .</l>
     <l n="125">When the moon rose , like a cup</l>
     <l n="126">Lay the valley , brimmed with wine</l>
     <l n="127">Of mesmeric shade and shine ,</l>
     <l n="128">To the moon 's pale face held up .</l>
     <l n="129">As she rose from out the mines</l>
     <l n="130">Of the eastern darkness , night</l>
     <l n="131">Met her , clad in dewy light</l>
     <l n="132">‘ Mid Pine Mountain 's sachem pines .</l>
     <l n="133">As from clouds in pearly parts</l>
     <l n="134">Her serene circumference grew ,</l>

    <head>AFTERWORD .</head>
    <p n="1">The old enthusiasms Are dead , quite dead , in me ; Dead the aspiring spasms Of art and poesy , That opened magic chasms , Once , of wild mystery , In youth 's rich Araby . That opened magic chasms .</p>
    <p n="2">The longing and the care Are mine ; and , helplessly , The heartache and despair For what can never be . More than my mortal share Of sad mortality , It seems , God gives to me , More than my mortal share .</p>
    <p n="3">O world ! O time ! O fate ! Remorseless trinity ! Let not your wheel abate Its iron rotary !— Turn round ! nor make me wait , Bound to it neck and knee , Hope 's final agony !— Turn round ! nor make me wait .</p>
