There may be more enchanting climes Within a southern zone ; There may be eastern Edens deckt With charms to thee unknown ; But thou art fairest unto me , Because thou art mine own , Canada , my land . More spacious plains and loftier heights In other realms may be , And mightier streams than those which bear Thy waters to the sea ; But thou , great handiwork of God , Art grandest unto me , Canada , my land . More glorious records may adorn The annals of the past Than those which tell the rise and growth Of thy dominion vast ; But I am proudest of the land In which my lot is cast , Canada , my land . Beneath thy green or snow-clad sod My fathers ’ ashes lie ; Thou hast my all , to thee I 'm bound By every dearest tie ; For thee I 'll gladly live , for thee I cheerfully would die , Canada , my land .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <head>THE PARSON AT THE HOCKEY MATCH .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It 's very disagreeable to sit here in the cold ,</l>
       <l n="2">And a sinful waste of time — ah , well , it 's too late now to scold ;</l>
       <l n="3">I 'll think about my sermon and my prayers for Sunday next ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the young folks may be happy — let me see — what was my text ?</l>
       <l n="5">But what a throng of people — an immortal soul in each :</l>
       <l n="6">With such an audience this would be a splendid place to preach .</l>
       <l n="7">I 'd have the pulpit half-way down — what ice ! without a smirch !</l>
       <l n="8">Here are the men — I wonder if they ever go to church .</l>
       <l n="9">“ The teams ? ” Ah , yes , “ the forwards , point , and cover-point and goal ” ;</l>
       <l n="10">Thank you , my dear , I understand — is that a lump of coal ?</l>
       <l n="11">“ Rubber ? ” Ah , yes , “ The puck ? ” just so ! One 's holding it , I see —</l>
       <l n="12">That fellow with his clothes all on — ah , that 's the referee .</l>
       <l n="13">What was he whistling for — his dog ? Why , they 've begun to play ;</l>
       <l n="14">Well , well , that 's rough ; I really think we 're doing wrong to stay .</l>
       <l n="15">It 's sickening , deafening ; dear ! I wish this uproar could be stilled .</l>
       <l n="16">I do sincerely trust there 'll not be anybody killed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="17">It 's a wondrous exhibition of alertness , speed , and strength .</l>
       <l n="18">I suppose there 's not much danger — there 's a fellow at full length .</l>
       <l n="19">He 's up again ; that 's plucky . Well , the little lad has pluck —</l>
       <l n="20">And now he 's master of the ice , possessor of the puck .</l>
       <l n="21">He dodges two opponents , but collides with one at last ,</l>
       <l n="22">A Philistine Goliath — David baffles him and fast</l>
       <l n="23">Darts onward o'er the whitening sheet , while from each crowded row</l>
       <l n="24">The crazed spectators cheer him on — Look !— has he lost it ? No !</l>
       <l n="25">He 's clear again . Played , played , my boy . I 'd like to see him score :—</l>
       <l n="26">( I 'll have no voice for Sunday if I shout like this much more ) —</l>
       <l n="27">But there his ruthless enemies o'erwhelm him in a shoal —</l>
       <l n="28">Well played , you hero , safely passed . Now for a shot on goal .</l>
       <l n="29">Shoot , shoot , you duffer ; shoot , you goose , you ass , you great galoot ,</l>
       <l n="30">You addle-pated idiot , you nincompoop , you — shoot !</l>
       <l n="31">You 've lost it ! Never mind — well tried — that other dash was grand .</l>
       <l n="32">Why do they stop ? “ Off side , ” you say ? I do n't quite understand .</l>
       <l n="33">That 's puzzling . I suppose it 's right . I wish they 'd not delay .</l>
       <l n="34">This is a most provoking interruption to the play .</l>

       <l n="37">I 'd like to see both ends at once ; I can n't from where we sit .</l>
       <l n="38">They 've scored one yonder — What 's the row ? A player has been hit ?</l>
       <l n="39">Such things are bound to happen in a rapid game like this ;</l>
       <l n="40">They 'll soon resume the play , my dear ; there 's nothing much amiss ,—</l>
       <l n="41">Some trifling accident received in a rough body check ,</l>
       <l n="42">A shoulder dislocated or a fracture of the neck .</l>
       <l n="43">Oh , no , it 's nothing serious — the game begins again .</l>
       <l n="44">They 're here , a writhing , struggling mass of half a dozen men</l>
       <l n="45">Battling and groaning with the strife , and breathing hard and fast ,</l>
       <l n="46">Swayed back and forth and stooping low like elms before the blast ,</l>
       <l n="47">Changing their places like a fleet of vessels tempest-driven</l>
       <l n="48">That blindly meet within the waves and part with timbers riven ,</l>
       <l n="49">Waving their sticks with frantic zeal — But is n't this a sight ?</l>
       <l n="50">My goodness ! I could sit and watch a game like this all night .</l>
       <l n="51">There , dirty trousers , there 's your chance . Muffed it ! Why were n't</l>
       <l n="52">you quick ?</l>
       <l n="53">This is a sight to make the sad rejoice , to heal the sick ,</l>
       <l n="54">To rouse the drones and give them life to last them half a year —</l>
       <l n="55">Hit him again !— I wish I had my congregation here .</l>

       <l n="56">My stars ! and this is hockey . Hockey 's the king of sports .</l>

       <l n="58">This is the greatest holiday I 've had for many weeks .</l>
       <l n="59">This helps one to appreciate the feeling of the Greeks .</l>
       <l n="60">I understand my Homer now — O Hercules , behold</l>
       <l n="61">Yon Trojan giant , he that 's cast in an Olympian mould ,</l>
       <l n="62">Ye gods , he more than doubled up that other stalwart cove —</l>
       <l n="63">Here comes swift-footed Mercury , the messenger of Jove .</l>
       <l n="64">Adown the blue , outstripping all , he speeds . Oh , what a spurt !</l>
       <l n="65">His shoulders have no wings , but see , he has them on his shirt .</l>
       <l n="66">He 's broken through the forward line , baffled the cover-point ,</l>
       <l n="67">Thrown down the other man and knocked their game all out of joint .</l>
       <l n="68">And now he rushes on the goal — this makes the senses reel —</l>
