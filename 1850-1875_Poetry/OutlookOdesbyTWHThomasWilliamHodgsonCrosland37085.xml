    <head>TO EVERYBODY</head>
    <head>TO THE PRIVATE MEMBER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My dear Sir ,—</l>
     <l n="2">You may think it unkind of me</l>
     <l n="3">To interrupt the peaceful calm of your holiday</l>
     <l n="4">With a poem about business .</l>
     <l n="5">But I assure you , my dear sir ,</l>
     <l n="6">That I do so with the very best intentions ,</l>
     <l n="7">And at the call of what I consider to be duty .</l>
     <l n="8">Duty , as you know , is a tremendous abstraction ,</l>
     <l n="9">And brings a man into all sorts of difficult corners .</l>
     <l n="10">It was duty that took you into Parliament :</l>
     <l n="11">Similarly it is duty that constrains me to Odes .</l>
     <l n="12">When a man sees another man and pities him ,</l>
     <l n="13">It is the duty of the first man to let the other man know about it</l>
     <l n="14">Delicately .</l>
     <l n="15">I pity you , my dear Mr . Private Member ,</l>
     <l n="16">From the bottom of a bottomless heart .</l>
     <l n="17">Many a time and oft in the course of my rambles</l>
     <l n="18">Through the lobbies and liquor bars of St. Stephens</l>
     <l n="19">It has been my ineffable portion to run across you —</l>
     <l n="20">Silk hat , frock coat , baggy trousers , patient stare , bored expression :</l>
     <l n="21">Suddenly you smile</l>
     <l n="22">And crook the pregnant hinges of the back of your neck .</l>
     <l n="23">Mrs. Wiggle , the three Misses Wiggle , and little Master Wiggle ,</l>
     <l n="24">Wife , daughters , and son of Mr. Forthree Wiggle ,</l>
     <l n="25">Draper , and burgess of the good old Parliamentary Division</l>
     <l n="26">Of Mudsher West ,</l>
     <l n="27">Are up from Mudsher West ,</l>
     <l n="28">And they want showin ’ round the ‘ Ouse , you know .</l>
     <l n="29">Round you go .</l>
     <l n="30">Again : you appear in the Strangers ’ Lobby ,</l>
     <l n="31">Spectacles on nose , somebody 's card in hand .</l>
     <l n="32">The policeman roars out name of leading constituent .</l>
     <l n="33">Leading constituent departed in a huff twenty minutes ago ,</l>
     <l n="34">Because he thought you were not attending to him .</l>
     <l n="35">There being no answer ,</l>
     <l n="36">Policeman roars out name of leading constituent once more .</l>
     <l n="37">Name echoes along Lords ’ Lobby ;</l>
     <l n="38">But not being there , leading constituent fails to come forward .</l>
     <l n="39">You look embarrassed , turn tail , retire to your back bench ,</l>
     <l n="40">And feel deucedly uncomfortable for the rest of the evening .</l>
     <l n="41">You would like to get away to the theatre ,</l>
     <l n="42">But you dare not do it :</l>
     <l n="43">There are Whips about .</l>
     <l n="44">You would like to go home to bed ;</l>
     <l n="45">You must wait the good pleasure of the course of the debate .</l>
     <l n="46">You would like to stand on your hind legs</l>
     <l n="47">And address the House on large matters :</l>
     <l n="48">But you know in your heart</l>
     <l n="49">That the House will stand absolutely nothing from you</l>
     <l n="50">Bar a question or so .</l>
     <l n="51">You sit , and sit , and sit through dull debate after dull debate ,</l>
     <l n="52">And you sigh for the hustings and the brass bands ,</l>
     <l n="53">And the banquets and the “ He'shYpppHeNahYpppHeNjollyhYpppHeNgoodhYpppHeNfellow ” -s</l>
     <l n="54">And wonder how it comes to pass</l>
     <l n="55">That you , who were once set down in the Mudsher Mercury</l>
     <l n="56">For a blend of Demosthenes and John Bright ,</l>
     <l n="57">Can never get more than twenty words off the end of your tongue</l>
     <l n="58">After “ Mr. Speaker , Sir . ”</l>
     <l n="59">Oh ! my dear Mr . Private Member ,</l>
     <l n="60">Your case is indeed a sad one ,</l>
     <l n="61">And it is all the sadder when one comes to reflect</l>
     <l n="62">That , as a general rule , you are a sincereish sort of man ,</l>
     <l n="63">Burning and bursting with a desire</l>
     <l n="64">To do your poor suffering country</l>
     <l n="65">A bit of good .</l>
     <l n="66">You know that the men who have the ear of the House</l>
     <l n="67">Are mere talkers ;</l>
     <l n="68">That they are only “ playing the party game , ”</l>
     <l n="69">And that the country may go to pot for anything they care .</l>
     <l n="70">And yet they make their speeches</l>
     <l n="71">And get them reported at length in the papers ,</l>
     <l n="72">And are given places in the Cabinet ,</l>
     <l n="73">And go for “ dines-and-sleeps ” with the King ,</l>
     <l n="74">What time you grow old and grey and obese and bleary eyed ,</l>
     <l n="75">And never get the smallest show .</l>
     <l n="76">I pity you , my dear Mr . Private Member , I do really .</l>
     <l n="77">But for your comfort I may tell you</l>
     <l n="78">That all you lack</l>
     <l n="79">Is courage</l>
     <l n="80">And brains .</l>

     <l n="82">Dear Sir , or Madam ,</l>
     <l n="83">As the case may be ,</l>
     <l n="84">When Britain first ,</l>
     <l n="85">At Heaving 's command ,</l>
     <l n="86">Arose from out</l>
     <l n="87">The azure main ,</l>
     <l n="88">This was the chawter</l>

     <l n="91">Sang this strain :</l>
     <l n="92">Do n't you think so ?</l>
     <l n="93">For my own part ,</l>
     <l n="94">I am quite sure of it :</l>
     <l n="95">Monday night convinced me .</l>
     <l n="96">Mafeking night ,</l>
     <l n="97">As you may remember ,</l>
     <l n="98">Was a honeyed</l>

     <l n="101">Peace night ,</l>
     <l n="102">I think ,</l>
     <l n="103">Really outdid it in splendours .</l>
     <l n="104">At the cafe</l>
     <l n="105">Which I most frequent ,</l>
     <l n="106">All was Peace .</l>
     <l n="107">Round the table next mine ,</l>
     <l n="108">There were seventeen Jews ,</l>
     <l n="109">With a Union Jack .</l>
     <l n="110">Ever and anon</l>
     <l n="111">( Between drinks , as it were ) ,</l>
     <l n="112">They held up</l>
     <l n="113">That Union Jack</l>
     <l n="114">And yelled :</l>
     <l n="115">“ Shend him victoriouth ,</l>

     <l n="119">I wonder , my dear Sir , or Madam ,</l>

     <l n="121">I can n't make it out .</l>
     <l n="122">Howsomever ,</l>
     <l n="123">Pleased they are ,</l>
     <l n="124">And a pleased Jew</l>
     <l n="125">Is worth a king 's ransom ,</l>
     <l n="126">Or words to that effect .</l>
     <l n="127">Peace , my dear Sir , or Madam ,</l>
     <l n="128">Is a chaste and choice</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="130">Outside the aforesaid cafe ,</l>
     <l n="131">The crowd</l>
     <l n="132">Was so numerous</l>
     <l n="133">And exuberant</l>
     <l n="134">That I was compelled</l>
     <l n="135">( Much to my annoyance , of course )</l>
     <l n="136">To remain inside</l>
     <l n="137">Till closing-time .</l>
     <l n="138">Then I went home</l>
     <l n="139">In the friendly embrace</l>
     <l n="140">Of a four-wheeler .</l>
     <l n="141">For a little while ,</l>
     <l n="142">There was much shouting and yelling and roaring and squeaking</l>

     <l n="144">And then I knew</l>
     <l n="145">No more .</l>
     <l n="146">My cab</l>
     <l n="147">Bowled away</l>
     <l n="148">Through the sweet evening air</l>
     <l n="149">( That is to say ,</l>
     <l n="150">If the common or Regent Street growler</l>
     <l n="151">Ever does bowl away ) ,</l>
     <l n="152">And all the time</l>
     <l n="153">I snored .</l>
     <l n="154">Duly awakened</l>
     <l n="155">Outside my bungalow ,</l>
     <l n="156">I raked up the fare ,</l>
     <l n="157">And , in reply to kind enquiries</l>
     <l n="158">In the hall ,</l>
     <l n="159">I remarked :</l>

    <p>TO THE CAMBRIDGE CREW</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="162">My dear Cambridge ,</l>
     <l n="163">You have pulled it off ,</l>
     <l n="164">As all men know .</l>
     <l n="165">This ode</l>
     <l n="166">Will make Oxford pretty sick ;</l>
     <l n="167">But the spoils are to the victor .</l>
     <l n="168">If Oxford had rowed better</l>
     <l n="169">And won ,</l>
     <l n="170">They should have had a nice new ode ,</l>
     <l n="171">Like good boys ;</l>
     <l n="172">But they have been and gone and lost ,</l>
     <l n="173">And are , therefore ,</l>
     <l n="174">Not fit subjects</l>
     <l n="175">For immortal verse .</l>
     <l n="176">Pah !</l>
     <l n="177">I pass by Oxford !</l>
     <l n="178">As for you , dear Cambridge ,</l>
     <l n="179">Here 's to you :</l>
     <l n="180">In spite of your long and honourable connection</l>
     <l n="181">With the manufacture</l>
     <l n="182">Of sossiges ,</l>
     <l n="183">There appears to be something in you ,</l>
     <l n="184">Which is more than can be said</l>
     <l n="185">For some of the sossiges .</l>
     <l n="186">Cambridge , my own ,</l>
     <l n="187">You have won the bowt rice !</l>
     <l n="188">‘ Ave a drink !</l>
     <l n="189">What is the good of winning the bowt rice ,</l>
     <l n="190">If you do n't ‘ ave a drink ?</l>
     <l n="191">I do n't know ,</l>
     <l n="192">And I 'm sure you do n't .</l>
     <l n="193">Also , what is the good</l>
     <l n="194">Of winning the bowt rice</l>
     <l n="195">At all ?</l>
     <l n="196">I give it up .</l>
     <l n="197">Yes , I do really ;</l>
     <l n="198">Please do let me give it up .</l>
     <l n="199">You have won ;</l>
     <l n="200">You can afford to be generous ;</l>
     <l n="201">Suffer me to indulge my little whim :</l>
     <l n="202">There is no good</l>
     <l n="203">In winning the bowt rice , Cambridge</l>
     <l n="204">No good at all .</l>
     <l n="205">On the other hand ,</l>
     <l n="206">When I come to think of it</l>
     <l n="207">I am not quite sure</l>
     <l n="208">That to have rowed</l>
     <l n="209">In the Cambridge boat</l>
     <l n="210">Which won the bowt rice ,</l>
     <l n="211">Is materially to have damaged</l>
     <l n="212">One 's prospects or career :</l>
     <l n="213">At the very least , it makes one safe</l>
     <l n="214">For a tutor 's job</l>
     <l n="215">At L80 per annum ;</l>
     <l n="216">And what self-respecting person from Cambridge</l>
     <l n="217">Could wish for more ?</l>
     <l n="218">I have heard of a man</l>
     <l n="219">Who rowed</l>
     <l n="220">In a winning Cambridge boat</l>
     <l n="221">And is now driving</l>
     <l n="222">A hansom cab .</l>
     <l n="223">And I have heard of another man</l>
     <l n="224">Who omitted to row</l>
     <l n="225">In a winning Cambridge boat</l>
     <l n="226">And is now driving a four-wheeler .</l>
     <l n="227">You see the difference , of course !</l>
     <l n="228">After all ,</l>
     <l n="229">To row</l>
     <l n="230">In a winning Cambridge boat</l>
     <l n="231">Does give one</l>
     <l n="232">A sort of start in life ,</l>
     <l n="233">And do n't you forget it .</l>
     <l n="234">Always remember , my dear Cambridge , who you are .</l>
     <l n="235">You licked Oxford by five lengths</l>
     <l n="236">In 1902 .</l>
     <l n="237">This is probably</l>
     <l n="238">All you will get</l>
     <l n="239">For your father 's money .</l>
     <l n="240">Be thankful .</l>

     <l n="4">For Art —</l>
     <l n="5">One of the biggest weeks in fact</l>
     <l n="6">On record .</l>
     <l n="7">For at the beginning of the week , my dear Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="8">You were a mere popular entertainer ,</l>
     <l n="9">Whereas at the present moment</l>
     <l n="10">You are a proud and ‘ appy man ,</l>
     <l n="11">And in a position to walk about the Strand</l>
     <l n="12">With a diamond E</l>
     <l n="13">Scintillating in your cravat .</l>
     <l n="14">The thing that was anticipated</l>
     <l n="15">By the intelligent paragraphists ,</l>
     <l n="16">My dear Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="17">Has come to pass .</l>
     <l n="18">His Britannic Majesty</l>
     <l n="19">King Edward VII ., D. G . : B. et T. T. B. R . : I. I .,</l>
     <l n="20">Does intend to give artists and authors and people</l>
     <l n="21">A little bit more of a show</l>
     <l n="22">Than has hitherto fallen to their lot .</l>
     <l n="23">His Majesty ,</l>
     <l n="24">My dear Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="25">Has always been noted for his tact ,</l>
     <l n="26">And in opening the ball with you , as it were ,</l>
     <l n="27">His Majesty has exhibited an amount of tact</l>
     <l n="28">Which leaves absolutely nothing to be desired .</l>
     <l n="29">Had he commenced with Mr. Swinburne ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or myself ,</l>
     <l n="31">Or Mr. Hall Caine</l>
     <l n="32">What howls there would have been !</l>
     <l n="33">Whereas as it is</l>
     <l n="34">Everybody is delighted ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the Halls resound nightly with his Majesty 's praises .</l>
     <l n="36">Furthermore ,</l>
     <l n="37">Besides being tactful ,</l>
     <l n="38">The King 's choice of you ,</l>
     <l n="39">My dear Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="40">For an invitation to Sandringham</l>
     <l n="41">Has its basis in a profound common sense ;</l>
     <l n="42">For I am acquainted with nobody in the movement ,</l>
     <l n="43">My dear Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who could have done the Sandringham turn</l>
     <l n="45">With anything like the success which appears to have been yours .</l>
     <l n="46">I gather from interviews</l>
     <l n="47">That the King “ laughed heartily ” at your jokes ,</l>
     <l n="48">And that “ it was a treat to see him enjoying himself . ”</l>
     <l n="49">It is just here that Mr. Swinburne , myself , and Mr. Hall Caine</l>
     <l n="50">Would have broken down .</l>
     <l n="51">It seems to me unlikely</l>
     <l n="52">That the King would have laughed</l>
     <l n="53">At Mr. Swinburne 's jokes ;</l>
     <l n="54">My own jokes , as everybody is aware ,</l>
     <l n="55">Are constructed on a principle</l>
     <l n="56">Which entirely prohibits laughter ;</l>
     <l n="57">While , as for Mr. Hall Caine 's jokes ,</l>
     <l n="58">They have such a tremendous sale</l>
     <l n="59">That it is not good form to laugh at them .</l>
     <l n="60">Mr. Leno , my boy ,</l>
     <l n="61">You have been the humble means</l>
     <l n="62">Of doing us all</l>
     <l n="63">A great kindness .</l>
     <l n="64">Those jokes of yours</l>
     <l n="65">Which have tickled Royal ears</l>
     <l n="66">Will be nectar to me</l>
     <l n="67">When next it is my pleasurable duty</l>
     <l n="68">To sit under you ;</l>
     <l n="69">That hand which Royalty has shaken</l>
     <l n="70">I shall grasp</l>
     <l n="71">With an added fervour ;</l>
     <l n="72">That smile will cheer me all the more readily</l>
     <l n="73">Because it has cheered</l>
     <l n="74">My liege Lord and Sovereign ;</l>
     <l n="75">Those feet ——</l>
     <l n="76">But , after all , the great point</l>
     <l n="77">Is the scarf pin .</l>
     <l n="78">I suppose you would not care to lend it to me</l>
     <l n="79">For a week or two</l>
     <l n="80">While I have one made</l>
     <l n="81">Like it ?</l>

    <p>TO THE POPE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="82">May it please your Holiness</l>
     <l n="83">There are possibly two ,</l>
     <l n="84">Or it may be three ,</l>
     <l n="85">Men</l>
     <l n="86">In Europe</l>
     <l n="87">Who could indite this Ode</l>
     <l n="88">Without treading on anybody 's corns .</l>
     <l n="89">After mature reflection ,</l>
     <l n="90">I am inclined to think that I am those three men</l>
     <l n="91">So that you will understand .</l>
     <l n="92">Well , my dear Pope , I hear on all hands</l>
     <l n="93">That you are engaged , at the present moment ,</l>
     <l n="94">In the cheerful act and process</l>
     <l n="95">Of having a Jubilee .</l>
     <l n="96">I have had several myself</l>
     <l n="97">And I know what pleasant little functions they are ,</l>
     <l n="98">Especially when the King</l>
     <l n="99">Sends a mission to congratulate one on them .</l>
     <l n="100">To proceed ,</l>
     <l n="101">You must know , my dear Pope ,</l>
     <l n="102">That , by conviction</l>
     <l n="103">And in my own delightful country ,</l>
     <l n="104">I am a rabid , saw-toothed Kensitite Protestant ;</l>
     <l n="105">All my ancestors figure gloriously</l>
     <l n="106">In Foxe 's “ Book of Martyrs , ”</l>
     <l n="107">And , if they do n't , they ought to .</l>
     <l n="108">Also , I never go into Smithfield</l>
     <l n="109">Without thinking of the far-famed fires thereof</l>
     <l n="110">And thanking my lucky stars</l>
     <l n="111">That this is Protestant England</l>
     <l n="112">And that the King defends the Faith .</l>
     <l n="113">But , when I get on to the Continent ,</l>
     <l n="114">To do my week-end in Paris ,</l>
     <l n="115">Or my “ ten days at lovely Lucerne , ”</l>
     <l n="116">Or my walk with Dr. Lunn</l>
     <l n="117">“ In the footsteps of St. Paul , ”</l>
     <l n="118">Why , then , somehow</l>
     <l n="119">The bottom falls clean out of my Kensitariousness</l>
     <l n="120">And I become a decent , mass-hearing , candle-burning Catholic .</l>
     <l n="121">That is curious , but true ,</l>
     <l n="122">And may probably be accounted for</l>
     <l n="123">By differences of climate .</l>
     <l n="124">However , we can leave that ;</l>
     <l n="125">Here , in England , my dear Pope ,</l>
     <l n="126">We all like you ,</l>
     <l n="127">Whether we be Catholics or Protestants or Jews or Gentiles or</l>
     <l n="128">members of the Playgoers ’ Club ;</l>
     <l n="129">And we all see you , in our minds ’ eye ,</l>
     <l n="130">Seated benevolently upon your throne</l>
     <l n="131">Giving people blessings ;</l>
     <l n="132">Or walking in the Vatican Garden</l>
     <l n="133">Clothed on with simple white .</l>
     <l n="134">We all think of you , my beloved Pope ,</l>
     <l n="135">As a diaphanous and dear old gentleman</l>
     <l n="136">Whose intentions are the kindest in the world .</l>
     <l n="137">And yet , and yet , and yet —</l>
     <l n="138">The memory of Smithfield</l>
     <l n="139">So rages in our honest British blood</l>
     <l n="140">That , in spite of your white garments</l>
     <l n="141">And your placid , gentle ways ,</l>
     <l n="142">We feel quite sure that you do carry ,</l>
     <l n="143">Somewhere about your person ,</l>
     <l n="144">A box of matches ;</l>
     <l n="145">And that , if certain people had their way ,</l>
     <l n="146">You would soon be lighting such a candle in England</l>
     <l n="147">That we should want a new Foxe</l>
     <l n="148">And a new Book of Martyrs</l>
     <l n="149">Of about the size of a pantechnicon .</l>
     <l n="150">Hence it is , my dear Pope ,</l>
     <l n="151">That we — er — Englishmen remain Protestant</l>
     <l n="152">And make the King swear fearful oaths</l>
     <l n="153">Against popery and all its works ,</l>
     <l n="154">Although , for aught one knows to the contrary ,</l>
     <l n="155">He may have Mass said twice daily</l>
     <l n="156">Behind the curtain , as it were .</l>
     <l n="157">All the same , I wish you good wishes</l>
     <l n="158">As to this your Jubilee</l>
     <l n="159">And</l>
     <l n="160">Nihil obstat .</l>

     <l n="162">My dear Mr. Chamberlain ,</l>
     <l n="163">Since you last heard from me ,</l>
     <l n="164">Many curious things have happened ,</l>
     <l n="165">Both in Birmingham and abroad .</l>
     <l n="166">As to the happenings in Birmingham ,</l>
     <l n="167">Nobody cares tuppence for them .</l>
     <l n="168">The happenings abroad , however , are a different matter ,</l>
     <l n="169">Inasmuch as they have brought you great fame ,</l>
     <l n="170">And cost us a lot of money .</l>
     <l n="171">Your influence in the governance of this great country ,</l>
     <l n="172">my dear Mr. Chamberlain ,</l>
     <l n="173">Is undoubted .</l>
     <l n="174">When you say things ,</l>
     <l n="175">It is understood that all your fellow-ministers</l>
     <l n="176">Sit up and look good .</l>
     <l n="177">“ We do n't like it , ” they say in their decent hearts ;</l>
     <l n="178">“ But Joseph says it must be so , and be so it must . ”</l>
     <l n="179">To the delicate souls of Arthur James ,</l>
     <l n="180">And George , and Broddy , and the rest of ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="181">You must , my dear Mr. Chamberlain , be a good deal of a trial ,</l>
     <l n="182">But , somehow , they have to put up with you ,</l>
     <l n="183">Even as the honest martyr has to put up with his shirt ;</l>
     <l n="184">And , for my own part , I rather like to see it :</l>
     <l n="185">At any rate , in a sort of way , do n't you know .</l>
     <l n="186">But , my dear Mr. Chamberlain ,</l>
     <l n="187">In the daily papers of Monday morning ,</l>
     <l n="188">What did I read ? Why , I read :</l>
     <l n="189">“ Mr. Chamberlain had an audience of the King</l>
     <l n="190">Yesterday afternoon . ”</l>
     <l n="191">And yesterday afternoon was Sunday afternoon .</l>
     <l n="192">Now , my dear Joseph , I do not mind in the least</l>
     <l n="193">What you do to Arthur James ,</l>
     <l n="194">Or what you do to George ,</l>
     <l n="195">Or what you do to Broddy ,</l>
     <l n="196">Or whether you do it on Sunday afternoons ,</l>
     <l n="197">Or on any other afternoon .</l>
     <l n="198">But I really must draw the line somewhere ,</l>
     <l n="199">And I wish you to understand</l>
     <l n="200">That if you go to see His Majesty the King</l>
     <l n="201">On Sunday afternoons</l>
     <l n="202">( On the afternoon of the Sabbath , as they would say in Birmingham ) ,</l>
     <l n="203">You do so entirely without my approval .</l>
     <l n="204">I think it is scandalous , and , not being a politician ,</l>
     <l n="205">I have no hesitation in saying what I think .</l>
     <l n="206">Somehow , while I know you to be a competent man of business ,</l>
     <l n="207">You never figure in my mind 's eye , Joseph ,</l>
     <l n="208">As the sort of man who ought to have</l>
     <l n="209">Personal communication with his Sovereign ,</l>
     <l n="210">Particularly on Sunday afternoons .</l>
     <l n="211">Birmingham men were not born to grace the Court ;</l>
     <l n="212">And , when it comes to the furnishing of Pleasant Sunday Afternoons</l>
     <l n="213">for Monarchs ,</l>
     <l n="214">In my opinion , they are quite out of it .</l>
     <l n="215">When business presses ,</l>
     <l n="216">As it no doubt did press on Sunday , Joseph ,</l>
     <l n="217">It is your business , as a Birmingham man ,</l>
     <l n="218">To remember your origin ,</l>
     <l n="219">And , if you have anything on your mind</l>
     <l n="220">Which really must be communicated</l>
     <l n="221">To His Gracious Majesty King Edward the Seventh ,</l>
     <l n="222">To look up the peerage and send round somebody</l>
     <l n="223">Who is , as one might say , fit for the job .</l>
     <l n="224">There is always Salisbury ,</l>
     <l n="225">There is always Arthur James ,</l>
     <l n="226">There is always George ,</l>
     <l n="227">And there is always Broddy :</l>
     <l n="228">These men , my dear Joseph , are gentlemen ,</l>
     <l n="229">And have known the Court all their lives .</l>
     <l n="230">What they do on Sundays I neither know nor care</l>
     <l n="231">But I have no doubt that , if you told them to go round and</l>
     <l n="232">see the King ,</l>
     <l n="233">They would go hotfoot and see him .</l>
     <l n="234">So that you have no excuse , Joseph .</l>
     <l n="235">Birmingham will , no doubt , forgive you this once :</l>
     <l n="236">As for me , I solemnly swear that I never will .</l>

     <l n="331">And “ The King 's Jester ” written all over you</l>
     <l n="332">As I have already stated ,</l>
     <l n="333">I do not doubt for a moment</l>
     <l n="334">That the King really did laugh</l>
     <l n="335">At Mr. Leno .</l>
     <l n="336">I have laughed at him</l>
     <l n="337">( That is to say , at Mr. Leno ) myself ,</l>
     <l n="338">And I know what it is ;</l>
     <l n="339">But to-day , Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="340">To-day being the 1st of April ,</l>
     <l n="341">It is my turn to laugh ,</l>
     <l n="342">And I do so with a right good will ,</l>
     <l n="343">For to-day , Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="344">Your cup appears to be full ,</l>
     <l n="345">Inasmuch as for this day only</l>
     <l n="346">You are actually editing a paper !</l>
     <l n="347">Now when a man takes to editing papers</l>
     <l n="348">All is over with him :</l>
     <l n="349">The next step is</l>
     <l n="350">Into the unutterable dark .</l>
     <l n="351">I have read your paper , Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="352">And I find that on the whole</l>
     <l n="353">It has been remarkably well edited :</l>
     <l n="354">That is to say , you as Editor</l>
     <l n="355">And your big co-editor ,</l>
     <l n="356">Mr. Campbell of that ilk ,</l>
     <l n="357">Have had the good sense</l>
     <l n="358">To edit the paper</l>
     <l n="359">In the only way in which an editor</l>
     <l n="360">Should edit a paper ,</l>
     <l n="361">Namely , by leaving it to itself</l>
     <l n="362">As much as possible .</l>
     <l n="363">If all editors would have the sense</l>
     <l n="364">To take this wise course ,</l>
     <l n="365">Contributors and subordinates , generally ,</l>
     <l n="366">Would , to say the least of it ,</l>
     <l n="367">Have a fairly happy life .</l>
     <l n="368">It seems in a way a pity , Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="369">That you should waste yourself</l>
     <l n="370">Upon an evening paper ,</l>
     <l n="371">When there are so many morning papers</l>
     <l n="372">Requiring Editors :</l>
     <l n="373">The Daily Chronicle , for example ,</l>
     <l n="374">Would have offered you a fair field</l>
     <l n="375">For the exercise of your extraordinary abilities ;</l>
     <l n="376">Even the Times might , for once in a way ,</l>
     <l n="377">Have added lustre to itself</l>
     <l n="378">By taking on</l>
     <l n="379">Your joyous and winning lucubrations ;</l>
     <l n="380">Then there is Punch ,</l>
     <l n="381">Which journal , I understand ,</l>
     <l n="382">Is always ( and still ) on the look-out</l>
     <l n="383">For that humour</l>
     <l n="384">Which somehow never comes its way .</l>
     <l n="385">But there , Mr. Leno ,</l>
     <l n="386">You have missed your chance ,</l>
     <l n="387">And possibly it will not come round again .</l>
     <l n="388">As you are young in journalism ,</l>
     <l n="389">Let me say three things to you :</l>
     <l n="390">Imprimis , never be an Editor ,</l>
     <l n="391">It is better to be in the ballet ;</l>
     <l n="392">Item , always be on either a morning paper or a weekly .</l>
     <l n="393">The all-day papers keep one too busy .</l>
     <l n="394">Item , if you are an editor only for a day ,</l>
     <l n="395">Be sure to subscribe to the Newspaper Press Fund ;</l>
     <l n="396">Otherwise , what will your widow do ?</l>

  <p>TO THE POET LAUREATE</p>
   <p>My dear Poet Laureate ,— Do not , I implore you , Be perturbed . It is not my purpose to harp Upon old strings , Or to express the smallest satisfaction Either with you as an official personage Or with your verses as a production of an official personage ; I have called to-day , as it were , For a little quiet talk : You are a fellow-townsman of mine , Consequently I am a fellow-townsman of yours ; We ought to get on well together . Between ourselves , my dear Poet Laureate , It seems to me That if you were to set about it In the right way You might , with very little trouble Render a real service to the State Being as you are The only writer fellow Who in his literary capacity Is associated with the Court , You have , if I may say so , chances and opportunities Such as do not appear to have been vouchsafed To any other contemporary worker in the department of Letters . Our Gracious Sovereign Lord King Edward VII . ( I make no doubt ) Continually consults you on matters literary “ Dear Mr. Austen ” ( I can hear him saying ) , “ Would you now advise me to read Mr. Newverse 's Sonnets And Miss Jumpabouti 's new novel , Or would you not ? ” Of course , my dear Poet Laureate , If you were one of those stiff ungenerous Poets Laureate Who make it a rule to stick to business , You would say very respectfully , “ Your Majesty honours me , But I am not your Majesty 's Book-Taster , Being , as your Majesty is aware , Paid only to wangle my harp In celebration of Births , Deaths , and Marriages . Therefore I must respectfully , civilly , humbly , and generally otherwisely Beg to decline to answer your Majesty 's kind inquiry . ” But my dear Poet Laureate , There is nothing of that sort about you . You believe that a Poet Laureate , Should not only be a sort of walking rhyming dictionary , But also a general compendium of advice , counsel , and straight tips For crowned heads . Hence ( I make no doubt ) That when his Majesty the King Does ask you for a hint as to the kind of book he ought to read You break the marble box of your wisdom Upon the palace floor And expound things to him . Having thus the ear Of an exceedingly amiable and capable Monarch , You should by all means Take advantage of the circumstance To do what you can in that quarter For the benefit of your brethren and sisters of the pen . Many of them , my dear Poet Laureate , Are at the present moment Going about the country With weary souls and tattered nerves Because their Services to Literature Have not been blessed and approved , Not to say “ recognised , ” By the Crown . Some of them believe in their hearts That they ought to have a peerage . Others desire to be Baronets , Knights , and so forth , In order that their wives may be called “ Lady . ” Others , whom I know , Would be well content with a humble K. C. B . And yet others Would go off their heads with joy If they might only be invited regularly To the King 's Levees and Droring Rooms . My dear Poet Laureate , I charge you to do your best for these suffering people . WRITING IS A NOBLE ART , IT SHOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE RECOGNISED BY THE CROWN . Rub these facts well in , my dear Poet Laureate ( You know who to rub ‘ em into ) ; And while you are about it , There are two persons On whose behalf You might use every legitimate endeavour To rub your hardest — One of them , my dear Poet Laureate , is YOURSELF And the other is MYSELF . Your own desires in the way of “ recognition ” Are of course your own affair , Ask for what you like , my dear Poet Laureate , And see that you get it , For me ( Let me whisper ) I want a pension .</p>

     <l n="22">The American woman , I am told ,</l>

     <l n="32">Which are creating all the trouble .</l>
     <l n="33">They are beginning to circulate</l>
     <l n="34">And “ geta-holt ”</l>
     <l n="35">Wherever honest Britons most do congregate .</l>
     <l n="36">My tobacco merchant ,</l>
     <l n="37">Who sells me two ounces of the real thing every week ,</l>
     <l n="38">Has just been bought up by an American syndicate ;</l>
     <l n="39">My barber is in the same case ;</l>
     <l n="40">And I feel sure</l>
     <l n="41">That the woman who brings home “ the laundry ”</l>
     <l n="42">Is seriously considering proposals which have been made to her</l>
     <l n="43">By a syndicate of wealthy American gentlemen .</l>
     <l n="44">The electric-lighting plant in St. Paul 's Cathedral</l>
     <l n="45">Was , it seems , paid for by an American .</l>
     <l n="46">Another American is doing something or other</l>
     <l n="47">With the underground railways ,</l>
     <l n="48">And a third proposes to erect a building</l>
     <l n="49">Which will contain 6 , 000 rooms</l>
     <l n="50">On one of the best sites</l>
     <l n="51">On the new Holborn-Strand improvement .</l>
     <l n="52">Also I am using</l>
     <l n="53">An American roll-top desk ,</l>

    <head>TO THE “ MUDDIED OAF ”</head>
     <l n="1">My dear Muddied Oaf ,—</l>
     <l n="2">While still a youth and all unknown to fame ,</l>
     <l n="3">I went to school .</l>
     <l n="4">And on a certain Saturday</l>
     <l n="5">I put on a beautiful blue jersey , and some striped knickers ,</l>
     <l n="6">And betook myself into a damp field</l>
     <l n="7">With my hands nice and clean ,</l>
     <l n="8">And my hair parted .</l>
     <l n="9">Within an hour 's time</l>
     <l n="10">My shins had the appearance of a broken paint can ,</l>
     <l n="11">My garments were covered with mud ,</l>
     <l n="12">One of my teeth had somehow got swallowed ,</l>
     <l n="13">And my hair was out of joint .</l>
     <l n="14">When I come to think of it ,</l>
     <l n="15">In that hour I must have been a Muddied Oaf ,</l>
     <l n="16">Though I did not know what to call myself .</l>
     <l n="17">And no doubt on that and successive Saturday afternoons</l>
     <l n="18">I won my various journalistic Waterloos ,</l>
     <l n="19">And contracted a stubborn cardiac hypertrophy</l>
     <l n="20">Which is even yet with me .</l>
     <l n="21">For nigh twenty years , however ,</l>
     <l n="22">I have never , to my knowledge ,</l>
     <l n="23">Taken part in a football match ;</l>
     <l n="24">And , in spite of Mr. Kipling ,</l>
     <l n="25">I do not propose to indulge again</l>
     <l n="26">In either Rugby or the other thing .</l>
     <l n="27">Youth loves to be muddied ;</l>
     <l n="28">In old age one flings one 's mud at other people .</l>
     <l n="29">I do n't know , my dear Muddied Oaf ,</l>
     <l n="30">How you like being called a Muddied Oaf .</l>
     <l n="31">The average Muddied Oaf of my acquaintance</l>
     <l n="32">Will not in the least understand</l>
     <l n="33">What Muddied Oaf means ,</l>
     <l n="34">And even when a dozen reporters</l>
     <l n="35">Have explained it to him , dictionary in hand ,</l>
     <l n="36">He will not care .</l>
     <l n="37">You cannot take the glory of having crumpled up the Footleum Otspurs</l>
     <l n="38">out of a man</l>
     <l n="39">By calling him Muddy ;</l>
     <l n="40">And as for Oaf ,</l>
     <l n="41">When all is said</l>
     <l n="42">It is a poor synonym for “ dashing forward . ”</l>
     <l n="43">No , my dear boy ,</l>
     <l n="44">Phrases out of poems cannot damp your ardours .</l>
     <l n="45">And , so far as you are concerned ,</l>
     <l n="46">Mr .</l>
     <l n="47">Rudyard</l>
     <l n="48">Kipling</l>
     <l n="49">May</l>
     <l n="50">Be</l>
     <l n="51">Blowed !</l>
     <l n="52">All the same , I assure you</l>
     <l n="53">As an old muddifier</l>
     <l n="54">That there is a great deal in what the gentleman says .</l>
     <l n="55">To a delicate age ,</l>
     <l n="56">Rifle practice presents many attractions :</l>
     <l n="57">To shoot out of a No . 1 rifle</l>
     <l n="58">At a choice array of clay pipes , dancing globules , and cardboard rabbits</l>
     <l n="59">Is on the face of it</l>
     <l n="60">A gentleman 's job :</l>
     <l n="61">You can do it with your hair parted :</l>
     <l n="62">And providing you do n't get betting drinks</l>
     <l n="63">That you will ring the bell every time ,</l>
     <l n="64">It does n't cost much .</l>
     <l n="65">Regular practice</l>
     <l n="66">At the ordinary shooting booths</l>
     <l n="67">Will no doubt make a soldier and a gentleman of you ,</l>
     <l n="68">And teach you to fear no Boer in shining armour .</l>
     <l n="69">These are points worth considering .</l>
     <l n="70">Also , the game does not hurt .</l>
     <l n="71">You need no lemon to help you through with it ,</l>
     <l n="72">You run no risk of dislocation , fracture , hypertrophy , gouged eye ,</l>
     <l n="73">or broken neck ,</l>
     <l n="74">You are on velvet all the time .</l>
     <l n="75">And when it comes to calling names ,</l>
     <l n="76">You will have the honour and glory</l>
     <l n="77">Of being set down for a gallant and gilt-edged</l>
     <l n="78">Defender of your country ,</l>
     <l n="79">Ponder it , O Muddied One ,</l>
     <l n="80">And be wise .</l>

    <head>TO A PUBLISHER</head>
     <l n="1">My dear Sir ,—</l>
     <l n="2">In the whole round</l>
     <l n="3">Of animated nature</l>
     <l n="4">I am acquainted</l>
     <l n="5">With nothing or nobody</l>
     <l n="6">Who is , generally speaking ,</l>
     <l n="7">So gay , gaudy , and interesting</l>
     <l n="8">As yourself .</l>
     <l n="9">From my youth up</l>
     <l n="10">I have been taught to look upon a publisher</l>
     <l n="11">As a very great person indeed .</l>
     <l n="12">When I was young and courted him</l>
     <l n="13">He it was drew from me</l>
     <l n="14">( As morn from Memnon )</l>
     <l n="15">Rivers of melody ;</l>
     <l n="16">The which , however ,</l>
     <l n="17">He took good care</l>
     <l n="18">Not to glorify with his imprimatur .</l>
     <l n="19">In those days</l>
     <l n="20">I looked upon publishing as a trade</l>
     <l n="21">And poetry as a profession .</l>
     <l n="22">Recently I have become wise ,</l>
     <l n="23">And I feel in the heart of me</l>
     <l n="24">That publishing is a profession</l>
     <l n="25">And poetry a trade .</l>
     <l n="26">In spite of all that has been said to the contrary ,</l>
     <l n="27">Barabbas</l>
     <l n="28">Certainly was not a publisher .</l>
     <l n="29">I have not had time to look him up ,</l>
     <l n="30">But I feel quite sure</l>
     <l n="31">That he was not a professional man .</l>
     <l n="32">Besides ,</l>
     <l n="33">If he was a publisher ,</l>
     <l n="34">Why did he not publish something ?</l>
     <l n="35">Echo and the Publishers ’ Association</l>
     <l n="36">No doubt answer</l>
     <l n="37">“ Why ? ”</l>
     <l n="38">I sometimes think I should like to be a publisher myself .</l>
     <l n="39">It must be rather nice</l>
     <l n="40">To know for a fact</l>
     <l n="41">How many copies</l>
     <l n="42">Mr. So-and-so , and Mr. So-and-so , and Mr. So-and-so</l>
     <l n="43">Really do sell ,</l>
     <l n="44">And how many “ A second large edition ”</l>
     <l n="45">And “ Tenth impression ”</l>
     <l n="46">Really mean .</l>
     <l n="47">It must be rather nice , also ,</l>
     <l n="48">To go off to Switzerland every year</l>
     <l n="49">( With your wife )</l>
     <l n="50">To attend the Publishers ’ Conference .</l>
     <l n="51">It must be rather nice , too ,</l>
     <l n="52">To know of a surety</l>
     <l n="53">That when an author is making money</l>
     <l n="54">Some publisher or other</l>
     <l n="55">Is making just as much ,</l>
     <l n="56">And not infrequently a trifle more ,</l>
     <l n="57">On the same work .</l>
     <l n="58">We have learnt of late</l>
     <l n="59">Greatly to our disgust</l>
     <l n="60">That when a publisher dies rich</l>
     <l n="61">He has made his money out of Apollinaris .</l>
     <l n="62">This is hard on authors ,</l>
     <l n="63">Who , between ourselves ,</l>
     <l n="64">Are not by any means bad people ,</l>
     <l n="65">And invariably take a kindly interest</l>
     <l n="66">In their publishers ’ welfare .</l>
     <l n="67">On the other hand ,</l>
     <l n="68">You must admit , sir ,</l>
     <l n="69">That a publisher seldom goes bankrupt ,</l>
     <l n="70">And does not as a rule sleep</l>
     <l n="71">Under his own counter .</l>
     <l n="72">Once</l>
     <l n="73">I lent a publisher half a crown .</l>
     <l n="74">He paid it back .</l>
     <l n="75">The average author would have taken it</l>
     <l n="76">As money earned .</l>
     <l n="77">So that , on the whole ,</l>
     <l n="78">I am inclined to like publishers ,</l>
     <l n="79">And to set them down in my tablets</l>
     <l n="80">For</l>
     <l n="81">Useful persons .</l>

     <l n="3">My thoughts fly</l>
     <l n="4">In your direction ,</l>
     <l n="5">For oft in the stilly night</l>
     <l n="6">It is my unfortunate habit</l>
     <l n="7">To have uncomfortable dreams ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the worst of them</l>
     <l n="9">Runs to bankruptcy .</l>
     <l n="10">I have a horror of bankruptcy ,</l>
     <l n="11">At any rate in my dreams .</l>
     <l n="12">I sometimes lie</l>
     <l n="13">Between the blankets</l>
     <l n="14">In a cold sweat</l>
     <l n="15">And for public examination as it were ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the presiding genius of the court</l>
     <l n="17">Says to me , sepulchrally ,</l>
     <l n="18">“ To what do you attribute your financial rottenness ? ”</l>
     <l n="19">I fall into a colder sweat</l>
     <l n="20">And remark ,</l>
     <l n="21">With a humility</l>
     <l n="22">Which becomes my unfortunate position ,</l>
     <l n="23">“ Sir , if you please ,</l>
     <l n="24">I have been living at an hotel . ”</l>
     <l n="25">At this juncture of course</l>
     <l n="26">I come in for every sympathy :</l>
     <l n="27">The Court is with me ,</l>
     <l n="28">The Court has been there itself ;</l>
     <l n="29">There is not a dry eye about the place ,</l>
     <l n="30">Every man present knows what I mean ,</l>
     <l n="31">And his heart is touched accordingly .</l>
     <l n="32">Sir ,</l>
     <l n="33">My dear Sir ,</l>
     <l n="34">You also know what I mean ;</l>
     <l n="35">In other words , you know</l>
     <l n="36">That I am the victim of a convention ,</l>
     <l n="37">And that , when all is said that can be said ,</l>
     <l n="38">You are the author of that convention .</l>
     <l n="39">As to the nature of that convention</l>
     <l n="40">We will put it this way :</l>
     <l n="41">One pound of steak</l>
     <l n="42">To the actual consumer</l>
     <l n="43">Should cost , say , 1s . 2d .</l>
     <l n="44">Trimmings</l>
     <l n="45">In the way of potatoes and peas might cost , say , 6d .,</l>
     <l n="46">Bread , 1d .,</l>
     <l n="47">Pepper , salt , and mustard , 1d .</l>
     <l n="48">( You will notice that I put a princely price on everything ) ,</l>
     <l n="49">Total , 1s . 10d .</l>
     <l n="50">Fifty per cent . profit for you , let us say ,</l>
     <l n="51">Would bring us up to 2s . 9d .</l>
     <l n="52">Really you ought to let one off for 2s . 9d .,</l>
     <l n="53">But what do you do ?</l>
     <l n="54">Well ,</l>
     <l n="55">So far as I can gather from your bills ,</l>
     <l n="56">You lie awake at night</l>
     <l n="57">Debating with yourself</l>
     <l n="58">Whether you should charge one 3s . 6d . or 4s . 6d .</l>
     <l n="59">And you usually come to the conclusion</l>
     <l n="60">That it will be best</l>
     <l n="61">For all parties concerned</l>
     <l n="62">To charge one 5s .</l>
     <l n="63">If one expostulates ,</l>
     <l n="64">You remark</l>
     <l n="65">With hauteur</l>
     <l n="66">That you thought you were dealing with a gentleman .</l>
     <l n="67">You are quite correct in this surmise .</l>
     <l n="68">But —</l>
     <l n="69">One pays ,</l>
     <l n="70">And you pocket the difference .</l>
     <l n="71">Then , again , on one 's bill</l>
     <l n="72">You put</l>
     <l n="73">Bed , 7s . 6d .</l>
     <l n="74">Which is cheap ;</l>
     <l n="75">And I do not murmur ;</l>
     <l n="76">But you also put</l>
     <l n="77">Attendance , 2s . 6d . ;</l>
     <l n="78">Coffee in bedroom before rising , 1s . ;</l>
     <l n="79">Bath , 1s . 6d . ;</l>
     <l n="80">This is just 5s . too much ,</l>
     <l n="81">Especially in view of the fact</l>
     <l n="82">That the attendance wears dirty shirts ,</l>
     <l n="83">That the bath</l>
     <l n="84">Is lukewarm if you order it cold</l>
     <l n="85">And lukewarm if you order it hot ;</l>
     <l n="86">And that the coffee before rising</l>
     <l n="87">Does n't cost you a farthing .</l>
     <l n="88">I am aware , of course ,</l>
     <l n="89">That all this is very mean</l>
     <l n="90">And low down</l>
     <l n="91">On my part ,</l>
     <l n="92">But frankly</l>
     <l n="93">Your rapacity</l>
     <l n="94">Matters not so much to me</l>
     <l n="95">As to yourself .</l>
     <l n="96">People come once to your establishment ,</l>
     <l n="97">They read your bill ,</l>
     <l n="98">Pay your prices</l>
     <l n="99">And tip your dirty-shirted waiters ,</l>
     <l n="100">And go away</l>
     <l n="101">And forget to come back .</l>
     <l n="102">Hence</l>
     <l n="103">You are bound to charge</l>
     <l n="104">The next man that comes along</l>
     <l n="105">As much extra as he will stand ,</l>
     <l n="106">And by slow degrees</l>
     <l n="107">Your establishment</l>
     <l n="108">Is becoming</l>
     <l n="109">A by-word</l>
     <l n="110">And a warning .</l>
     <l n="111">My dear Sir ,</l>
     <l n="112">Have a shilling bottle of wine</l>
     <l n="113">( For which you charge me 3s . 6d . )</l>
     <l n="114">At your own expense ,</l>
     <l n="115">Consult with your wife ,</l>
     <l n="116">And make up your mind</l>
     <l n="117">Never to charge</l>
     <l n="118">More than 2s .</l>
     <l n="119">For 9d . worth of goods .</l>
     <l n="120">Honesty is its own reward —</l>
     <l n="121">It is really .</l>

   <p>TO THE MAN WITH A GUN</p>
   <p>My dear Sir ,— I suppose you are having an excellent time just now . There are a large number of counties In England and Scotland , And I am not acquainted with one of them Wherein your bang-bang And puffs of smoke And red-faced men with dogs Are not to be encountered . You like it ; It is very nice ; And really , when you come to think of it , It is what the counties were made for . In the history books They were wont to say Of a certain Norman monarch , That he loved the red deer As if he were their brother . Of you it may safely be said That you love the red grouse And the brown partridge . As if you were a poulterer . You are a sportsman . The man who first went out with a gun To shoot game Probably did it on the sly . Had he been caught He would no doubt have been regarded By the sportsmen of his day With the same contempt That you yourself indulge For the unprincipled blackguard , Sir , Who shoots foxes . But time and the gunsmiths Have changed all that ; And now you are a sportsman , A shooter of birds For the London market . You are also a gunner , And you kill things . Oh ! why do you not go And live at Gunners-bury ? Bad joke ? Well , I know it is . But I assure you , my dear Sir , That it is not half so bad as I can make them When I try . To come now to the region Of practical politics , Let me explain to you right off That , despite all that has been said against you By people who are mad about the Land And the Game-laws , And the feathered kingdom And so forth , I , Who am always on the side of wisdom , Have discovered a justification for you . It is this : There has been a great demand of late For really competent shots . In response to that demand Mr. Kipling has started a village rifle club . I understand that the members thereof Are , let us say , five hundred in number . Now , I put it to you , Sir , How many sportsmen are there Shooting in this beautiful country and Scotland To-day ? Well , we will not compute ; It is dangerous . But you could make a fairly big rifle club out of them . They are all good men , And of course all beautiful shots . Some day ( When the war is over ) England may want them . Will they answer to the call ? My dear Sir , You have your uses . Go in peace .</p>

    <head>TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE</head>
     <l n="1">( On its Centenary )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Stock Exchange ,— I am given to understand That to-day you are a hundred years old , And that to-day therefore You will celebrate What nine men out of every ten of you Call your “ Centeenary ” By taking a whole holiday instead of a half one . It would be easy for me , my dear Stock Exchange , To present you With a sort of illuminated address on this occasion ; But I refrain . One short year ago I tumbled into a little money ; It was “ not enough to live upon , ” But it was a nice sum . A man introduced me to a member of the Stock Exchange , The member of the Stock Exchange introduced me to a little game of “ in and out , ” And my five hundred pounds folded its tents like the Arabs — That is to say , it silently stole away . It was not the member of the Stock Exchange 's fault ; Certainly it was not my fault ; And I will not say that it was the fault of the Stock Exchange . But I am not giving the Stock Exchange Any illuminated addresses At present . On the other hand , let me assure you That I believe the Stock Exchange To be a highly respectable , Honourable , And useful institution . It leaves the court without a stain upon its character . I say these latter things advisedly , Because some time back A friend of mine who writes articles on food supply Having delivered himself of the opinion That London 's milk was largely water , Was sued for slander By the Amalgamated Society of Dairymen 's Daughters , And had to climb down and apologise . So that on the whole I repeat that , in my humble opinion , If you want to find Really sound , white men , Men of spotless character and impregnable probity , You cannot do better Than wend your way to Gorgonzola Hall . And joking apart , my dear Stock Exchange , You really are a blessing . If it were not for you People with a lot of money , And people with only a little , Would simply not lose it . It would lie in banks and old stockings and kindred receptacles Till it went mouldy . You keep things going . You are the heart of the monetary world , You pump in the gold , You pump out all that you do n't happen to want . And you go and live in Maida Vale , Keep a butler , Drive two horses , And change your name from Manassah to Howard . This “ Centeenary ” holiday of yours Gives me much pause . Supposing , instead of taking a day , You were to take a year , What would happen to England ? SHE — WOULD — BE — RUINED ! Yeth , indeed .</p>

    <head>TO THE LORD MAYOR</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">( November 9th )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">My dear Lord Mayor ,—</l>
     <l n="3">In Fleet Street all is gay</l>
     <l n="4">From min ’ office window I catch glimpses</l>
     <l n="5">Of fluttering bunting and swinging festoons .</l>
     <l n="6">I do n't know who pays for them</l>
     <l n="7">( The bunting and the festoons , that is to say ) ,</l>
     <l n="8">But I am informed by the police that they</l>
     <l n="9">( The bunting and the festoons , that is to say )</l>
     <l n="10">Have been hung up in honour of YOU .</l>
     <l n="11">I am also given to understand that there has been a big rush</l>
     <l n="12">For free windows to view your procession ,</l>
     <l n="13">Which , all being well ( the Procession , that is to say )</l>
     <l n="14">Will take place this day , Saturday ;</l>
     <l n="15">For my own part I am going into the country ,</l>
     <l n="16">And I dare say that on the whole</l>
     <l n="17">You wish you were going with me ;</l>
     <l n="18">But ambition has its penalties ,</l>
     <l n="19">And if you will become Lord Mayor of London</l>
     <l n="20">( A dizzy pinnacle to which none but the biggest-souled of us</l>
     <l n="21">May aspire )</l>
     <l n="22">I suppose you must put up with the attendant inconveniences</l>
     <l n="23">And publicity .</l>
     <l n="24">So far as I have been able to judge</l>
     <l n="25">( And I arrive at this conclusion by dint of steadfast abstinence</l>
     <l n="26">From witnessing Lord Mayors ’ Shows )</l>
     <l n="27">A Lord Mayor 's Show is a distinctly inspiriting spectacle .</l>
     <l n="28">It may be set down</l>
     <l n="29">As the Londoner 's one annual opportunity</l>
     <l n="30">Of seeing a circus for nothing ;</l>
     <l n="31">Hence no doubt its popularity .</l>
     <l n="32">Think not , however , my dear Lord Mayor ,</l>
     <l n="33">That I deprecate your little pageant , gratis though it be .</l>
     <l n="34">This country , as everybody knows ,</l>
     <l n="35">Has for centuries past been on the high road to ruin ,</l>
     <l n="36">And , in my humble opinion , its decadence has been largely due</l>
     <l n="37">To a deep-rooted tendency on the part of the powerful</l>
     <l n="38">To curtail and do away with mayoral and other shows .</l>
     <l n="39">Feasts and fairs have been kicked out of England</l>
     <l n="40">By the aforesaid powerful :</l>
     <l n="41">If you would be a respectable community</l>
     <l n="42">You must have neither feast nor fair ,</l>
     <l n="43">And , if you would be a respectable citizen of any given city ,</l>
     <l n="44">You must not array yourself in motley .</l>
     <l n="45">A man who walked into his bank</l>
     <l n="46">In yellow trousers and a blue silk hat</l>
     <l n="47">Would never be allowed an overdraft ,</l>
     <l n="48">Black and subdued greens and browns being the only wear</l>
     <l n="49">For persons who would get on in life .</l>
     <l n="50">All this is wrong , my dear Lord Mayor .</l>
     <l n="51">I am of opinion that millionaires</l>
     <l n="52">Ought to wear purple breeches ;</l>
     <l n="53">I see no reason why I myself</l>
     <l n="54">Should not have a morning coat of red , white , and blue ,</l>
     <l n="55">Or a waistcoat emblazoned with the arms</l>
     <l n="56">Of the Worshipful Company of Spectaclemakers .</l>
     <l n="57">In fact , my dear Lord Mayor ,</l>
     <l n="58">To perpetrate a Mrs. Meynellism ,</l>
     <l n="59">The colour of life is the salt of it ,</l>
     <l n="60">Just as the Lord Mayor 's Show is the salt of the Lord Mayoralty</l>
     <l n="61">And the one beautiful thing</l>
     <l n="62">About life as people expect you to live it</l>
     <l n="63">In the Metropolis .</l>
     <l n="64">Come hither , come hither , my dear Lord Mayor ,</l>
     <l n="65">And do not tremble so !</l>
     <l n="66">We are all glad to see you going up Fleet Street ,</l>
     <l n="67">We are all glad to see you going home the other way ;</l>
     <l n="68">And we shall be equally glad to see your successor</l>
     <l n="69">Getting through the same flowerful day 's work</l>
     <l n="70">Next year .</l>
     <l n="71">Goodbye , my dear Lord Mayor !</l>
     <l n="72">And</l>
     <l n="73">Hooray ?</l>

    <head>TO THE MOTORIST</head>
     <l n="1">My dear Sir ,—</l>
     <l n="2">When men have nightmares , they dream about you .</l>
     <l n="3">I myself have been chased over the tops of pinnacles</l>
     <l n="4">By flaming-eyed Panhards and Durkopps</l>
     <l n="5">In my sleep .</l>
     <l n="6">Nor is this all ,</l>
     <l n="7">For if one brings oneself</l>
     <l n="8">To read reports of the proceedings of police courts</l>
     <l n="9">One finds that the average citizen</l>
     <l n="10">Gets more or less chased by you sir ,</l>
     <l n="11">In his waking moments .</l>
     <l n="12">The Police I know , sir , seldom speak the truth :</l>
     <l n="13">They remember so well the day</l>
     <l n="14">When a horseless carriage had to be taken through the street</l>
     <l n="15">At the speed of a funeral march ,</l>
     <l n="16">And with a red flag in front of it ,</l>
     <l n="17">That the spectacle of an affable motorist</l>
     <l n="18">Bowling through a Surrey village</l>
     <l n="19">To the tune of six miles an hour</l>
     <l n="20">Shocks ther imagination ,</l>
     <l n="21">And they believe for the rest of their natural lives</l>
     <l n="22">That the affable motorist aforesaid</l>
     <l n="23">Must have been travelling</l>
     <l n="24">At the rate of anything from 60 to 600 miles per minute .</l>
     <l n="25">Hence , my dear motorist ,</l>
     <l n="26">It comes to pass that you are afforded so many opportunities</l>
     <l n="27">For airing your eloquence and the fatness of your purse</l>
     <l n="28">Before the police magistrates .</l>
     <l n="29">In my opinion it seems just possible</l>
     <l n="30">That the real trouble lies in the fact</l>
     <l n="31">That you , my dear sir , do actually</l>
     <l n="32">Go through villages at a very low speed ,</l>
     <l n="33">And that really the best thing you can do</l>
     <l n="34">Would be to make a point of going through them</l>
     <l n="35">At the highest speed consistent</l>
     <l n="36">With the safety of your own person .</l>
     <l n="37">For if you did this ,</l>
     <l n="38">No policeman of my acquaintance would be able to catch you ,</l>
     <l n="39">Hence you would never be fined .</l>
     <l n="40">I have been out of sympathy with motor cars</l>
     <l n="41">Right up to the other night .</l>
     <l n="42">The other night I had the felicity to take a small trip on one .</l>
     <l n="43">The motorist would fain have driven me to my house ,</l>
     <l n="44">Which is half an hour 's cab drive from Charing Cross .</l>
     <l n="45">He offered to do the distance in ten minutes</l>
     <l n="46">And started stirring up his petroleum ,</l>
     <l n="47">But I said “ No . Let us go to the Marble Arch . ”</l>
     <l n="48">We went through the Mall , to Hyde Park Corner ,</l>
     <l n="49">to South Kensington , to Paddington ,</l>
     <l n="50">Into the Edgware Road , and so to the Marble Arch ;</l>
     <l n="51">Time , at the outside , 15 min .</l>
     <l n="52">I am willing to admit</l>
     <l n="53">That we went down certain streets quite rapidly ,</l>
     <l n="54">What time the policemen at odd corners stared stupidly ,</l>
     <l n="55">And fumbled for their note-books .</l>
     <l n="56">But , as a result of that trip , my dear sir ,</l>
     <l n="57">I have become an enthusiastic motorist .</l>
     <l n="58">I am convinced that speed and wind and the smell of petroleum mixed</l>
     <l n="59">Is the only thing which can be considered worth living for .</l>
     <l n="60">And if you happen to know anybody</l>
     <l n="61">Who would be willing to take</l>
     <l n="62">A typewriter and a pair of skates ( not much worn )</l>
     <l n="63">In exchange for a Durkopp racer ,</l>
     <l n="64">Kindly communicate with me .</l>

    <head>TO NEXT CHRISTMAS</head>
     <l n="1">My dear Next Christmas ,—</l>
     <l n="2">It is an excellent journalistic thing ,</l>
     <l n="3">Not to say a poetical thing ,</l>
     <l n="4">To be first in the field .</l>
     <l n="5">Behold me , therefore , advancing</l>
     <l n="6">At the head of that motley army</l>
     <l n="7">Which will inevitably hail you</l>
     <l n="8">When your time comes .</l>
     <l n="9">For your predecessor ,</l>
     <l n="10">My dear Next Christmas ,</l>
     <l n="11">I cannot say much .</l>
     <l n="12">He came in with several thousand inches of rain ;</l>
     <l n="13">He went out on a watery moon .</l>
     <l n="14">There was turkey as usual ,</l>

     <l n="16">Mistletoe as usual ,</l>
     <l n="17">Peace on earth as usual .</l>

     <l n="25">Half the world pretended to be happy ,</l>
     <l n="26">The other half pretended to be bored .</l>
     <l n="27">The festivities , I understand ,</l>
     <l n="28">Are still being kept up .</l>
     <l n="29">There is a ping-pong tournament at the Queen 's Hall</l>

     <l n="1">My dear Sir , or Madam ,—</l>
     <l n="2">When James Watt ,</l>

     <l n="4">Had the luck</l>

     <l n="11">However ,</l>
     <l n="12">James Watt</l>
     <l n="13">Omitted to take cognisance of the ultimate trouble ,</l>

     <l n="16">Till our iron roads are beaten into ploughshares ,</l>

     <l n="21">Your goings to and fro upon the earth ,</l>
     <l n="22">And walkings up and down thereon ,</l>
     <l n="23">Were limited by the day trip .</l>
     <l n="24">For half-a-crown</l>
     <l n="25">You went to Brighton ,</l>

     <l n="28">As the case may be .</l>
     <l n="29">A special tap of ale</l>
     <l n="30">And a special cut of ‘ am</l>
     <l n="31">Were put on for your delectation ;</l>
     <l n="32">You sang a mixture of hymns</l>
     <l n="33">And music-hall songs</l>
     <l n="34">On your homeward journey ,</l>
     <l n="35">And there was an end of the matter .</l>

     <l n="37">The trip that was over and done</l>
     <l n="38">In twenty-four hours at most</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">May it please your Worships ,</l>
     <l n="3">For years past , Glasgow has stood in the forefront</l>
     <l n="4">As a city given over to the small-pox</l>
     <l n="5">And magisterial reform .</l>
     <l n="6">It is , I believe ,</l>
     <l n="7">An exceedingly well-managed city :</l>
     <l n="8">In fact , it appears to be managed</l>
     <l n="9">Out of all reasonable existence ;</l>
     <l n="10">Hence , no doubt , it comes to pass</l>
     <l n="11">That it was lately visited</l>
     <l n="12">By a smart sample of the plague .</l>
     <l n="13">I have not the smallest doubt that your Worships</l>
     <l n="14">Are sincere and clean-thinking men .</l>
     <l n="15">I believe that you do what you do do , so to speak ,</l>
     <l n="16">Out of sheer public spirit</l>
     <l n="17">And with a view to bettering the condition</l>
     <l n="18">Of the city over which you preside .</l>
     <l n="19">In other words , I impute no motives :</l>
     <l n="20">That is to say , no base motives .</l>
     <l n="21">But , my dear Worships ,</l>
     <l n="22">Why , in the name of Heaven , would you abolish</l>
     <l n="23">The harmless , necessary barmaid ?</l>
     <l n="24">Have you never been young ?</l>
     <l n="25">Have you never known the tender delight</l>
     <l n="26">Of whiling away a morning</l>
     <l n="27">With your elbow on the zinc</l>
     <l n="28">And threepennyworth of Bass before you ?</l>
     <l n="29">What , may I ask your Worships ,</l>
     <l n="30">Is Bass without a barmaid ?</l>
     <l n="31">I grant that , taking them all in all ,</l>
     <l n="32">The barmaids of Scotland</l>
     <l n="33">Are not what you might term</l>
     <l n="34">An altogether bewitching lot .</l>
     <l n="35">Years ago , when I was young and callow ,</l>
     <l n="36">Fate threw me into the propinquity</l>
     <l n="37">Of a lady of this ilk ;</l>
     <l n="38">She hailed from Glasgow ,</l>
     <l n="39">And she was not beautiful ;</l>
     <l n="40">On the other hand , I was young .</l>
     <l n="41">And , out of an income which was even slenderer then</l>
     <l n="42">Than it is now ,</l>
     <l n="43">I purchased for that dear lady of the North</l>
     <l n="44">Many bottles of perfume ,</l>
     <l n="45">Many pairs of kid gloves ,</l>
     <l n="46">And a Prayer Book or so ;</l>
     <l n="47">And , when I had consumed innumerable Basses</l>
     <l n="48">At her altar ,</l>
     <l n="49">And the time had , as I thought , become ripe ,</l>
     <l n="50">I offered her matrimony ,</l>
     <l n="51">To which she replied , in limpid Doric :</l>
     <l n="52">“ Gang awa hame to yer mither . ”</l>
     <l n="53">That , my dear Worships ,</l>
     <l n="54">Is Glasgow !</l>
     <l n="55">If you can weed out of Glasgow</l>
     <l n="56">All young females</l>
     <l n="57">Possessed of this particular kind of temperament ,</l>
     <l n="58">I am not so sure</l>
     <l n="59">But that you would have my blessing .</l>
     <l n="60">On the other hand , I am free to admit</l>
     <l n="61">That I hae my doots as to your capacity for so doing .</l>
     <l n="62">The perfume-bottle ,</l>
     <l n="63">The kid gloves ,</l>
     <l n="64">The Prayer Book</l>
     <l n="65">And “ Na , na , na , I winna , ”</l>
     <l n="66">Will always remain the prerogatives</l>
     <l n="67">Of the Glasgae lassies ,</l>
     <l n="68">If I know anything of them .</l>
     <l n="69">Also , my dear Worships ,</l>
     <l n="70">One thing is absolutely certain ,</l>
     <l n="71">That , if the magistrates of all the cities</l>
     <l n="72">In the United Kingdom</l>
     <l n="73">Would take the step you have taken ,</l>
     <l n="74">We should have gone a very considerable way</l>
     <l n="75">Towards solving the drink problem ,</l>
     <l n="76">And putting Sir Michael Hicks-Beach</l>

     <l n="14">Of entirely different build from yourself .</l>
     <l n="15">I was born a poet ,</l>

     <l n="17">Unto this last .</l>
     <l n="18">Possibly you were born a bookseller .</l>
     <l n="19">I am willing to give your credit for it ,</l>
     <l n="20">But I doubt it all the same ,</l>
     <l n="21">For I often think the average bookseller</l>
     <l n="22">Must have been born a draper .</l>
     <l n="23">The other day I had occasion to do a little book-buying .</l>
     <l n="24">It was my first essay</l>
     <l n="25">In what I now believe to be</l>
     <l n="26">An altogether elegant and delightful form</l>
     <l n="27">Of intellectual recreation .</l>

     <l n="42">Whereat he smiled and banged under my nose</l>
     <l n="43">A heavy volume ,</l>
     <l n="44">Bound like a cheap purse ,</l>
     <l n="45">And murmured , “ There you are ,</l>
     <l n="46">The best line in the market ,</l>
     <l n="47">Two-and-eight . ”</l>
     <l n="48">And because I opened it ,</l>
     <l n="49">And looked disconsolately at the stodgy running-titles</l>
     <l n="50">And the entrancing red-line border ,</l>
     <l n="51">He cast upon me eyes of contempt and disgust ,</l>

     <l n="55">In fact , that fat youth</l>

     <l n="58">Let us clear our minds of Cecil .</l>
     <l n="59">After all is said</l>
     <l n="60">You are the Auntie of my children ,</l>
     <l n="61">And the great-niece of my wife 's great-uncle ,</l>

     <l n="63">Come along ,</l>
     <l n="64">Here are ducats ,</l>
     <l n="65">A ring ,</l>

     <l n="70">And we have forgotten about Mrs. ——</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">My dear Sir Michael Hicks-Beach ,—</l>
     <l n="3">The devotion of one 's life</l>
     <l n="4">To the service of the Muses</l>
     <l n="5">And the neglect of golden opportunities ,</l>
     <l n="6">Is not without its compensations ,</l>
     <l n="7">One of the chief of them being</l>
     <l n="8">That the devotee can look into the eyes</l>
     <l n="9">Of the most rapacious of Chancellors of the Exchequer</l>
     <l n="10">And smile .</l>
     <l n="11">For my own part , dear Sir Michael ,</l>
     <l n="12">By the writing of Odes ,</l>
     <l n="13">And general inattention to business ,</l>
     <l n="14">I am able to knock up a precarious one hundred and seventy-five</l>
     <l n="15">pounds per annum ;</l>
     <l n="16">On one hundred and sixty pounds of that sum</l>
     <l n="17">I am always careful to claim exemption ,</l>
     <l n="18">Which leaves a taxable balance of fifteen pounds .</l>
     <l n="19">Out of this balance , my dear old friend , you are welcome to take</l>
     <l n="20">fifteen shillings ,</l>
     <l n="21">Or twenty-three and fourpence ha'penny ,</l>
     <l n="22">Or twenty-seven and sixpence farthing ,</l>
     <l n="23">Or any other sum that you think might come in handy .</l>
     <l n="24">Indeed , in all the circumstances</l>
     <l n="25">( And without prejudice ) ,</l>
     <l n="26">I should not be greatly upset</l>
     <l n="27">If you took the lot .</l>
     <l n="28">For well I wot</l>
     <l n="29">That the late War</l>
     <l n="30">Has cost more than the price of a row of houses ,</l>
     <l n="31">And that it is my duty , as a full-blooded patriot ,</l>
     <l n="32">To pay , and pay cheerfully ;</l>
     <l n="33">And particularly so</l>
     <l n="34">Since it is not due for a month or so .</l>
     <l n="35">Ah , my dear Chancellor ,</l>
     <l n="36">Who fears Black Michael</l>
     <l n="37">Must himself be black .</l>
     <l n="38">They call you Black because you want a lot of money ;</l>
     <l n="39">I call them black because they 've got it .</l>
     <l n="40">However , this is not a Ruskinian oration ,</l>
     <l n="41">But an Ode ,</l>
     <l n="42">And I shall therefore proceed to give you a few tips</l>
     <l n="43">As to legitimate methods of raising the wind .</l>
     <l n="44">Judging by your recent efforts ,</l>
     <l n="45">You appear to be short of ideas .</l>
     <l n="46">Here you are .</l>
     <l n="47">Put sixpence a hundred on cigars .</l>
     <l n="48">“ See What You Save ”</l>
     <l n="49">Will see me through somehow ;</l>
     <l n="50">Besides , I never smoke cigars .</l>
     <l n="51">Put a bit more on all sorts of wines and liqueurs ,</l>
     <l n="52">Excepting Sauterne and Benedictine</l>
     <l n="53">( Of which I am particularly fond ) ;</l>
     <l n="54">Put a bit more on beer ,</l>
     <l n="55">And sixpence a pound on arsenic</l>
     <l n="56">( As a rule I do not take either ) ;</l>
     <l n="57">Tax railway tickets</l>
     <l n="58">( I invariably travel on “ passes ” ) ;</l>
     <l n="59">Tax perambulators</l>
     <l n="60">( My sons and heirs can all walk ) ;</l>
     <l n="61">Tax sky-signs</l>
     <l n="62">( Like the Omar Khayyam Club ,</l>
     <l n="63">I never advertise ) ;</l>
     <l n="64">Tax bicycles</l>
     <l n="65">( I abhor exertion ) ;</l>
     <l n="66">Tax gold and gem jewellery</l>
     <l n="67">( I never keep it ) ;</l>
     <l n="68">Tax fiction</l>
     <l n="69">And “ Fourth enormous ” editions</l>
     <l n="70">( We shall then hear less about them )</l>
     <l n="71">Abolish the free breakfast-table</l>
     <l n="72">( I invariably begin the day with lunch ) ;</l>
     <l n="73">Also tax ground-rents</l>
     <l n="74">( I am not the Duke of Bedford ) ;</l>
     <l n="75">And seize all the unclaimed bank balances</l>
     <l n="76">( None of which by any possibility</l>
     <l n="77">Can be mine ) .</l>
     <l n="78">In fact , my dear Sir Michael ,</l>
     <l n="79">Tax and seize whatever you like .</l>
     <l n="80">The opulent , and the well-to-do ,</l>
     <l n="81">Not to mention the rascally working classes ,</l>
     <l n="82">Will have to put up with it .</l>

    <head>TO THE COMMON GOLFER</head>
     <l n="1">My dear Common Golfer ,—</l>
     <l n="2">The game you affect</l>
     <l n="3">Is a great game</l>
     <l n="4">Played by yourself</l>
     <l n="5">And all the crowned heads of Europe ,</l>
     <l n="6">Not to mention all the fat persons who desire to bant ,</l>
     <l n="7">All the thin persons who desire to become</l>
     <l n="8">Vigorous and muscular , as it were ,</l>
     <l n="9">All the clerks who desire to pass for dukes ,</l>
     <l n="10">And all the dukes who relish the society of clerks .</l>
     <l n="11">It is a great game :</l>
     <l n="12">The people who play it are not the fault of the game .</l>
     <l n="13">It is also a good game .</l>
     <l n="14">If I am not mistaken ,</l>
     <l n="15">It is a game that originally came out of Scotland ;</l>
     <l n="16">Therefore it must be a good game .</l>
     <l n="17">For everything that comes out of Scotland is good ,</l>
     <l n="18">Even the Scot .</l>
     <l n="19">And golf being a great and good game</l>
     <l n="20">I do not see any tremendous reason</l>
     <l n="21">Why you , my dear Common Golfer ,</l>
     <l n="22">Should not engage in it if you so choose .</l>
     <l n="23">On the other hand , I wish from the bottom of my heart</l>
     <l n="24">That you did not engage in it .</l>
     <l n="25">I know a bank</l>
     <l n="26">Whereon the wild thyme blows</l>
     <l n="27">( Or ought to blow ):</l>
     <l n="28">Oft of a pleasant summer morn</l>
     <l n="29">Have I taken a cheap ticket</l>
     <l n="30">To a station which is not far from that bank ,</l>
     <l n="31">And there ( on the bank , that is to say ) reclined me</l>
     <l n="32">What time I looked up into the blue dome ,</l>
     <l n="33">And watched the lazy-pacing clouds ,</l>
     <l n="34">And flicked away the midges ,</l>
     <l n="35">And wished my name was Corydon ,</l>
     <l n="36">And remembered bits of Keats</l>
     <l n="37">And bits of Herrick</l>
     <l n="38">And bits of business ,</l>
     <l n="39">And so forth .</l>
     <l n="40">Oft , I say , have I done these things ;</l>
     <l n="41">But of late I no longer do them ,</l>
     <l n="42">Inasmuch as my bank</l>
     <l n="43">Has become ( if I may so term it )</l>
     <l n="44">Golf-ridden .</l>
     <l n="45">The other day I repaired to the said bank</l>
     <l n="46">On rural musings bent .</l>
     <l n="47">What did I find ?</l>
     <l n="48">Why , my dear old thymy bank</l>
     <l n="49">Was in the possession</l>
     <l n="50">Of half a dozen gross fellows in red coats ,</l>
     <l n="51">Thy had pipes in their mouths ,</l>
     <l n="52">And a jar of beer in their midst ,</l>
     <l n="53">And they were actually talking and laughing</l>
     <l n="54">In the most uproarious fashion .</l>
     <l n="55">I heard one of them say</l>
     <l n="56">“ Why did Arthur Bawl-Fore ? ”</l>
     <l n="57">And the others thought hard ,</l>
     <l n="58">And trifled with their brassies and things ,</l>
     <l n="59">And could not make answer .</l>
     <l n="60">O , my dear Common Golfer ,</l>
     <l n="61">You were of that party ;</l>
     <l n="62">You were ;</l>
     <l n="63">You are always of such parties ,</l>
     <l n="64">You are always sitting</l>
     <l n="65">On other people 's thymy banks ,</l>
     <l n="66">And saying , “ Why did So-and-so so-and-so ? ”</l>
     <l n="67">And depleting village public-houses of good beer ,</l>
     <l n="68">And turning whole village populations into caddies ,</l>
     <l n="69">And dotting the landscape with your red coats ,</l>
     <l n="70">And generally appropriating the fair face of Nature .</l>
     <l n="71">I cannot stop you , my dear Common Golfer ,</l>
     <l n="72">I cannot , O I cannot !</l>
     <l n="73">Would that I could . O would that I could !</l>
     <l n="74">In which case , perhaps , I would n't .</l>
     <l n="75">No , my dear boy ,</l>
     <l n="76">Rural England is yours ,</l>
     <l n="77">Also the sea-side ,</l>
     <l n="78">Take them , old man , take them ;</l>
     <l n="79">I hand them over to you with the best heart in the world .</l>
     <l n="80">Take them — they are yours —</l>
     <l n="81">And excuse these tears .</l>

    <head>TO MR. PIERPONT MORGAN</head>
     <l n="1">Dear Mr. Pierpont Morgan ,—</l>
     <l n="2">I hasten to give you a hearty British welcome .</l>
     <l n="3">Come to my arms ;</l>
     <l n="4">I am in the Trust line myself —</l>
     <l n="5">That is to say , I used to be</l>
     <l n="6">Before people started putting up announcements</l>
     <l n="7">To the effect that</l>
     <l n="8">“ Poor Trust is dead ,</l>
     <l n="9">Bad pay killed him . ”</l>
     <l n="10">Some day , an I mistake not , Mr. Morgan ,</l>
     <l n="11">Your Trust will die :</l>
     <l n="12">All Trusts are grass .</l>
     <l n="13">Ponder it !</l>
     <l n="14">I am a political economist , and I know .</l>
     <l n="15">Meanwhile I am very pleased to think</l>
     <l n="16">That we have amongst us a man of your financial prowess</l>
     <l n="17">And purchasing power .</l>
     <l n="18">There is a certain class of British person</l>
     <l n="19">Who apparently goes in bodily fear of you .</l>
     <l n="20">That class of person has groaned loudly over your steel exploit ,</l>
     <l n="21">And he has groaned loudlier still</l>
     <l n="22">Over your purchase of the Leyland Line of Steamships .</l>
     <l n="23">To groan over a fair deal of any kind</l>
     <l n="24">Appears to me , my dear Mr. Pierpont Morgan ,</l>
     <l n="25">To be an entirely stupid proceeding .</l>
     <l n="26">Nobody can come to grief by selling things ,</l>
     <l n="27">Providing they sell them at the right price .</l>
     <l n="28">You have bought the Leyland Line of Steamships :</l>
     <l n="29">I see no reason why you should not buy all the other lines</l>
     <l n="30">If you want them , and have the wherewithal to pay for them ,</l>
     <l n="31">For in the long run everything comes to him who vends .</l>
     <l n="32">You buy my steamships , or my steelworks ,</l>
     <l n="33">Or , for that matter , my caller herrin ':</l>
     <l n="34">I take your money , I put it in your bank ,</l>
     <l n="35">And live sumptuously on the interest .</l>
     <l n="36">You have all the trouble</l>
     <l n="37">Inasmuch as you have to rake up the interest .</l>
     <l n="38">I sit at home and enjoy myself ,</l>
     <l n="39">You scheme , and scheme , and scheme , and scheme , and scheme ,</l>
     <l n="40">and scheme , and scheme ,</l>
     <l n="41">I am happy ,</l>
     <l n="42">I hope you are .</l>
     <l n="43">Between ourselves I should not tremble</l>
     <l n="44">If you bought up Great Britain and Ireland ( especially Ireland ) ,</l>
     <l n="45">And all that in them is ,</l>
     <l n="46">Providing always , as I have said before ,</l>
     <l n="47">That you paid the price .</l>
     <l n="48">Indeed , I hope to live to see the day</l>
     <l n="49">When Englishmen will cease to toil and spin ,</l>
     <l n="50">And derive their incomes</l>
     <l n="51">Wholly and solely from American dividends .</l>
     <l n="52">Fools buy things , my dear Mr. Pierpont Morgan ,</l>
     <l n="53">Wise men sell them .</l>
     <l n="54">That is particularly true</l>
     <l n="55">When the article involved happens to be poetry .</l>
     <l n="56">Nevertheless , as you appear to be in a buying frame of mind ,</l>
     <l n="57">I take this opportunity of informing you</l>
     <l n="58">That I have at my villa at Hindhead</l>
     <l n="59">A large and varied stock</l>
     <l n="60">Of sonnets , odes , rhymes , jingles , and what not ,</l>
     <l n="61">Which I am prepared to sell at an enormous sacrifice .</l>
     <l n="62">My price to you for the lot would be</l>
     <l n="63">Fifteen Million Dollars .</l>
     <l n="64">If you care to deal , I undertake to melt your cheque</l>
     <l n="65">At your own bank ,</l>
     <l n="66">And to invest the proceeds in any concerns</l>
     <l n="67">In which you happen to be interested ,</l>
     <l n="68">So that you would not only get the poetry ,</l>
     <l n="69">But also your money back again .</l>
     <l n="70">This , at any rate , is how it seems to me .</l>
     <l n="71">Vale !</l>

     <l n="2">Most well-behaved little Prince ,—</l>

     <l n="5">Of certain other small boys</l>
     <l n="6">In whom I am interested</l>
     <l n="7">I hasten to assure you</l>
     <l n="8">Of my loyalty to the Imperial House</l>

     <l n="10">And of my respect for your own podgy little person .</l>
     <l n="11">To-day , I need scarcely tell you , my dear little Prince ,</l>
     <l n="12">Is a very big day for you ,</l>
     <l n="13">Inasmuch as</l>
     <l n="14">To-day your excellent parents —</l>
     <l n="15">Their Royal Highnesses</l>
     <l n="16">The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York , KG .—</l>
     <l n="17">Return from their wanderings ,</l>
     <l n="18">Laden , I am given to understand ,</l>
     <l n="19">With presents for his Royal Highness</l>
     <l n="20">Prince Edward of York ,</l>
     <l n="21">Who , I am given to understand ,</l>
     <l n="22">Has been a very good boy</l>
     <l n="23">During these long weeks of separation .</l>
     <l n="24">I am quite sure</l>
     <l n="25">That you deserve these presents ,</l>
     <l n="26">And that your Grandmama</l>
     <l n="27">Will be able to give your parents a very good account of you ,</l>
     <l n="28">And that your Grandpapa ,</l>
     <l n="29">With that tact which is only one of many of his excellent qualities ,</l>
     <l n="30">Will refrain from making reports</l>
     <l n="31">Which might lead to parental chastisement ,</l>
     <l n="32">I remember quite well</l>
     <l n="33">That when my own Mama and Papa</l>
     <l n="34">Returned once from a little jaunt</l>
     <l n="35">They brought back with them ,</l>
     <l n="36">As a present for me ,</l>
     <l n="37">A tin cylinder with a spike to it ,</l>
     <l n="38">Which you set on a piece of wood</l>
     <l n="39">And spun round ;</l>
     <l n="40">Then you looked through some holes in the tin cylinder</l>
     <l n="41">And beheld many wonderful things ,</l>
     <l n="42">Such as a little girl skipping ,</l>
     <l n="43">And jockeys riding a steeplechase on tigers .</l>
     <l n="44">If your Papa , my dear little Prince ,</l>
     <l n="45">Has not brought you one of those ,</l>
     <l n="46">Be sure you ask for it .</l>
     <l n="47">It is not rude to ask for what you do not see in the window ,</l>
     <l n="48">Providing you say “ Please . ”</l>
     <l n="49">And now before I go</l>
     <l n="50">Let me add a few words</l>
     <l n="51">Of kindly admonition .</l>
     <l n="52">I hope you will grow up to be a good and great man ,</l>
     <l n="53">And that you will never give your parents</l>
     <l n="54">Cause for sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="55">By turning Socialist ,</l>
     <l n="56">Or newspaper editor ,</l>
     <l n="57">Or attempting to imitate these Odes .</l>
     <l n="58">To your infant mind</l>
     <l n="59">This last crime</l>
     <l n="60">May appear to be the most innocent in the world ,</l>
     <l n="61">Because these odes</l>
     <l n="62">( God wot )</l>
     <l n="63">Are so easy to imitate ;</l>
     <l n="64">Diplomats , Members of Parliament , publishers ’ assistants ,</l>
     <l n="65">Cabmen , poets , peers of the realm ,</l>
     <l n="66">Nay , even the very crowned heads of Europe ,</l>
     <l n="67">Have , at time and time ,</l>
     <l n="68">Been consumed with a desire to do them for me ;</l>
     <l n="69">Because , as I have said ,</l>
     <l n="70">It is so easy .</l>
     <l n="71">Well , my dear little Prince ,</l>
     <l n="72">Let us draw our moral .</l>
     <l n="73">The easy thing is not always the wisest thing .</l>
     <l n="74">I feel that in my inmost heart .</l>
     <l n="75">And if you blossom into manhood</l>
     <l n="76">With the same conviction ,</l>
     <l n="77">More or less ,</l>
     <l n="78">I make no doubt whatever</l>

   <p>TO MME . BERNHARDT</p>
   <p>My dear Madame Bernhardt ,— I have been very nigh addressing this ode To the winner of the Derby . But , on second thoughts , I said , “ No , no — never ! ” ( Non , non , jamais , in fact . ) “ Not while we have in our midst One of whom I wot , For is it meet That the charming Mme . Bernhardt Should return to her interesting country Possessed of the impression that the bas Anglais Have a greater feeling for le sport Than for the arts dramatiques , Or whatever you call ‘ em ? Non , non , a thousand times , non ! ” Ah , Madame , believe me , I love my country — La patrie , la patrie , la patrie , you know : It is a fine country when you understand it , And I would have my beautiful Bernhardt Take away with her Nothing but splendid memories of it . I was exceedingly glad To read in the papers the other morning That in the opinion of the critics dramatiques Anglais , Or whatever you call ‘ em , Madame had done herself proud At the Lyceum Theatre the other evening . One critic dramatique Anglais , Or whatever you call him , Wrote of Madame thus : “ Such passages , Wherein the eaglet is borne away On a flight of adoration for the dead eagle , Recur throughout the play : They are , in fact , its keynote , And Mme . Bernhardt Declaimed them with superb intensity . The famous voice has lost its golden notes , But its power to thrill remains , She runs the gamut of the emotions With all the grace and dexterity Of A PROFESSOR . ” Madame Bernhardt , You will perceive That the critics dramatiques Anglais , Or whatever you call ‘ em , Write of nobody That they do not adorn ; My beautiful B ., You are a made woman , You have all the grace and dexterity Of A PROFESSOR . O happiness ! O crown and fulfilment of a life-time devoted to Ar-rt ! Your cup , my quenchless one , Is at length heaped up , Like Benjamin 's , And it runs over ! Heaven bless us all ! And in conclusion , my dear Mme . Bernhardt , Will you do me the honour to allow me to explain That in the event of any young enthusiast from Paris Calling round at any of our newspaper offices With a view to getting satisfaction From the person who accuses you Of having all the skill and dexterity Of A PROFESSOR , He ( the young enthusiast from Paris ) Will do himself no good , Because in my dear country , dear Madame Bernhardt , We do not fight the duel a la cut finger , Like gentlemen ; We merely throw downstairs .</p>

    <head>TO SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT</head>
     <l n="1">My dear Sir William Harcourt ,—</l>
     <l n="2">( I have not time to get up your other distinguished names ,</l>
     <l n="3">So that you must please excuse the plain Sir William ) ,</l>
     <l n="4">My dear Sir William , do you ever survey the Liberal party ,</l>
     <l n="5">From China to Peru ,</l>
     <l n="6">And from Rosebery to Lloyd-George as it were ?</l>
     <l n="7">Do you , my dear Sir William ? O do you ?</l>
     <l n="8">I do sometimes .</l>
     <l n="9">I do , Sir William , I do indeed .</l>
     <l n="10">O , I do !</l>
     <l n="11">And what is the conclusion I come to , my dear Sir William ,</l>
     <l n="12">Ah , what ?</l>
     <l n="13">O , what ?</l>
     <l n="14">What , what , what , what , what , what , what , what , what ?</l>
     <l n="15">Shall I tell you , my dear Sir William ?</l>
     <l n="16">You are sure you wo n't be offended if I do ?</l>
     <l n="17">And it will be strictly between ourselves , now , wo n't it ?</l>
     <l n="18">Well then , come hither , coz ,</l>
     <l n="19">Put your sweet hand in mine and trust in me ,</l>
     <l n="20">And do not construe my kindness into cruelty ;</l>
     <l n="21">Harken , my dear Sir William , harken ,</l>
     <l n="22">Harken , harken , harken , harken har —— court :—</l>
     <l n="23">The Liberal party is an unweeded garden</l>
     <l n="24">Choked with a myriad strange growths ,</l>
     <l n="25">And a sad , fierce , baffled , careless-ordered thing to look upon ,</l>
     <l n="26">And in its midst there sits down perennially</l>
     <l n="27">A huge and ponderous and unwieldy ruminant ,</l>
     <l n="28">Whom , merely for the sake of talking , my dear Sir William ,</l>
     <l n="29">We will call the Harcourt .</l>
     <l n="30">Here , when it is not at its lordly pleasure-house ,</l>
     <l n="31">Which men call Malwood ,</l>
     <l n="32">The Harcourt , as I say , sits down .</l>
     <l n="33">Goodman Bannerman cometh to his Liberal Garden</l>
     <l n="34">To gather him a posy and do a little weeding ;</l>
     <l n="35">The Harcourt is there heavily chewing the cud ,</l>
     <l n="36">And it takes the heart out of goodman Bannerman</l>
     <l n="37">To behold him .</l>
     <l n="38">Goodman Asquith had fain pick a bit of dinner in the precincts ;</l>
     <l n="39">The Harcourt watcheth him with rolling eye ,</l>
     <l n="40">And goodman Asquith shivereth .</l>
     <l n="41">And by and by cometh the simple , rural Rosebery ,</l>
     <l n="42">Armed cap-a-pie with a muck-fork ;</l>
     <l n="43">Being rural he understands gardening ;</l>
     <l n="44">He looks over the wall and sayeth ,</l>
     <l n="45">“ Gadzooks , when folk tell me that I am the man to put this</l>
     <l n="46">garden to rights</l>
     <l n="47">They speak a mortal deal o ’ truth .</l>
     <l n="48">I will e'en go in and delve a bit . ”</l>
     <l n="49">And then he beholdeth the Harcourt</l>
     <l n="50">Luxuriating with his back against the biggest fig tree ,</l>
     <l n="51">And he sayeth “ No ;</l>
     <l n="52">That powerful big animal be there still ,</l>
     <l n="53">And I know'un , I do , I know'un ! ”</l>
     <l n="54">And who shall blame him ?</l>
     <l n="55">What jobbing gardener of any self-respect</l>
     <l n="56">Would undertake to do up my genariums and fuchers</l>
     <l n="57">If I had a wild rhinoceros gambolling upon them</l>
     <l n="58">Day in and day out ?</l>
     <l n="59">I should have great difficulty</l>
     <l n="60">In finding such a jobbing gardener , my dear Sir William ;</l>
     <l n="61">And , to come at once to the plain poetry so beloved of this age ,</l>
     <l n="62">Let me tell you , my dear Sir William ,</l>
     <l n="63">That , in my opinion , you ( and no other ) are at the present juncture</l>
     <l n="64">The real trouble and incubus of the party you love .</l>
     <l n="65">If you would only go home and crown yourself with a laurel or two ,</l>
     <l n="66">And read history books , and take tea with bishops</l>
     <l n="67">And not come back again ,</l>
     <l n="68">I believe the Liberal party</l>
     <l n="69">Would begin to get along like a house afire .</l>
     <l n="70">Will you not try it , my dear Sir William ; oh , will you not try it ?</l>
     <l n="71">For who would fardels bear and flounder round ,</l>
     <l n="72">When he might sit with Lulu on the lawn</l>
     <l n="73">And leave his party for his party 's good ?</l>

    <head>TO THE KING 'S BULLDOG</head>
     <l n="1">Dear Brindle ,—</l>
     <l n="2">Possibly your name is not Brindle ,</l>
     <l n="3">But that is of no consequence ;</l>
     <l n="4">The great point , my dear Brindle , being</l>
     <l n="5">That when his Majesty Edward VII .</l>
     <l n="6">Landed at Flushing the other day</l>
     <l n="7">He was accompanied</l>
     <l n="8">By</l>
     <l n="9">You .</l>
     <l n="10">At least so I gather from the halfpenny papers ,</l>
     <l n="11">And I am free to admit</l>
     <l n="12">That when I read the paragraph</l>
     <l n="13">Descriptive of your landing at Flushing</l>
     <l n="14">My bosom swelled with honest pride .</l>
     <l n="15">I am not a doggy man myself ,</l>
     <l n="16">Dear Brindle ,</l>
     <l n="17">And no judge of points .</l>
     <l n="18">Also ,</l>
     <l n="19">When I see a dog coming towards me</l>
     <l n="20">I invariably</l>
     <l n="21">Whisper</l>
     <l n="22">“ Bite , ”</l>
     <l n="23">And consequently</l>
     <l n="24">My hair</l>
     <l n="25">Is apt to stand on end</l>
     <l n="26">Like quills upon the fretful porcupine</l>
     <l n="27">At pretty well every canine approach .</l>
     <l n="28">Bulldogs especially</l>
     <l n="29">Affright me ,</l>
     <l n="30">So that I can well understand</l>
     <l n="31">How the little foreign boy ,</l>
     <l n="32">Assembled at Flushing</l>
     <l n="33">To scoff in his sleeve at the English King ,</l>
     <l n="34">Remained to flee as it were</l>
     <l n="35">At the sight of you .</l>
     <l n="36">That , in a nutshell ,</l>
     <l n="37">Is why my bosom swelled</l>
     <l n="38">When I read the paragraph</l>
     <l n="39">To which previous reference has been made .</l>
     <l n="40">It was a picturesque circumstance , my dear Brindle .</l>
     <l n="41">And may be taken</l>
     <l n="42">As one more illustration</l>
     <l n="43">Of his Majesty 's determination</l>
     <l n="44">( Pray excuse the rhyme )</l>
     <l n="45">To do things as a king of England should .</l>
     <l n="46">To have alighted at Flushing</l>
     <l n="47">Accompanied by a Lion</l>
     <l n="48">Would have been a little outre ,</l>
     <l n="49">And Unicorns , we know ,</l>
     <l n="50">Are not obtainable —</l>
     <l n="51">What does his Majesty do ?</l>
     <l n="52">Why he takes , as he always has taken ,</l>
     <l n="53">The middle and dignified course :</l>
     <l n="54">He disjects himself on Flushing</l>
     <l n="55">With You by his side .</l>
     <l n="56">Next to the Lion and the Unicorn</l>
     <l n="57">The Bulldog may be reckoned</l>
     <l n="58">The truest</l>
     <l n="59">Exemplar and symbol</l>
     <l n="60">Of our great nation .</l>
     <l n="61">It is like this :</l>
     <l n="62">The Bulldog is not too beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="63">Neither is our great nation ;</l>
     <l n="64">But he frightens people —</l>
     <l n="65">So do we ;</l>
     <l n="66">He is tenacious</l>
     <l n="67">And magnanimous —</l>
     <l n="68">Which is just our game ;</l>
     <l n="69">He fears no foe in shining armour ,</l>
     <l n="70">Or any other sort of armour —</l>
     <l n="71">That is precisely our case ;</l>
     <l n="72">And he is kept by Lord Charles Beresford ,</l>
     <l n="73">The Duke of Manchester ,</l>
     <l n="74">And Mr. G. R. Sims —</l>
     <l n="75">Three eminently typical Britons .</l>
     <l n="76">In short ,</l>
     <l n="77">The genius of the British nation ,</l>
     <l n="78">My dear Brindle ,</l>
     <l n="79">Is not a policeman</l>
     <l n="80">But a Bulldog .</l>

    <head>TO THE DAILY MAIL</head>
     <l n="1">( Aug. 3 , 1901 )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear “ Daily Mail , ” — To-day you attain Your 1 , 650th number , Which , for the sake of talking , We will call your Jubilee . Congratulations , My dear Daily Mail , Congratulations ! There are people in the world Who , In the time of your infancy , Gave you the usual three months . Most new papers Get three months on the day of their birth . For at the sight of a new sheet , Your wise man invariably taps his nose , Looks even wiser than is his wont , And says , “ My dear Sir , I give it Three months . ” Well , My dear Daily Mail , You have survived the sentence of the wise , And I am given to understand That you have long been a tremendous property . Once again Congratulations ! BUT ( These buts are fearful things , Are they not ? ) — But ( Pray excuse me if I appear to say “ but ” again ) — But — Well , you know what I mean , do n't you ? Let me put it this way . When I come to town of a morning , Per ‘ bus or Potromelitan Railway , As the case may be , What do I see ? Not to put too fine a point upon it , I see a row of silk or straw hats ( According to the state of the weather ) , And I see a row Of choice trouserings , And between the hats and the trouserings There is spread A row of rustling morning papers . I can tell you the names of those papers With my eyes shut : Five out of six of them is called The Daily Mail . This upsets me . It is all right for you , of course , But it distresses me , And I do not like being distressed . Now , why does it distress me ? Shall I tell you ? Are you sure that you could bear the blow ? Can you pull yourself together for a moment ? Very well , then , You distress me Because The price of you is one halfpenny . I am of opinion That in the present condition of the general purse , Things which are sold for a halfpenny Are really too cheap . I will give you my reasons some other day . Meanwhile ( To take your own case ) When I look into your pages , Which is seldom , What do I find ? I will be frank for the second time , And tell you : I find , My dear Daily Mail , Ha'pennyness Writ in every line of you , From the front page , “ Personal Column , ” With its “ Massa , me nebber leab you While you keep So-and-So 's toffee about , ” To the last line Of your astonishing Magazine page , You are Ha'pennyness , Ha'pennyness , Ha'pennyness , Ha'pennyness , Ha'pennyness , Ha'pennyness All the time . Of course there is no harm in that , Especially As you get the ha'pennies , And far be it from me To contemn you for it . On the other hand , As I have remarked previously , I do not like it . I have no advice to offer you , Inasmuch As I do not see how you can help yourself . But I shall ask you kindly to note That the congratulations Expressed at the beginning of this poem Bear reference to your attainment of your 1 , 650th number And not To another matter , Which , While you certainly have the right upon your side , You appear to me to be conducting IN AN UNMITIGATED HA'PENNY WAY .</p>

    <head>TO EVERYBODY</head>
     <l n="1">My dear Everybody ,—</l>
     <l n="2">The other day I lunched at a place</l>
     <l n="3">Where there was a pretty lady .</l>
     <l n="4">During the course of the talk</l>
     <l n="5">The pretty lady said to me ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ You see , Everybody is out of town</l>
     <l n="7">At present . ”</l>
     <l n="8">I said , “ Who is Everybody ? ”</l>
     <l n="9">Whereupon the pretty lady replied ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ Well — er — Everybody . ”</l>
     <l n="11">I said , “ Quite so ;</l>
     <l n="12">But do n't you think it is rather</l>
     <l n="13">Fortunate that Everybody is out of town ?</l>
     <l n="14">And the pretty lady answered and said ,</l>
     <l n="15">“ No . ”</l>
     <l n="16">I conclude , therefore ,</l>
     <l n="17">That you , Everybody ,</l>
     <l n="18">Must , on the whole , be rather nice .</l>
     <l n="19">I hope you are ;</l>
     <l n="20">For Everybody should be rather nice ,</l>
     <l n="21">Should they not ?</l>
     <l n="22">And when I come to think of it</l>
     <l n="23">The circumstance that I heard of you</l>
     <l n="24">The other day</l>
     <l n="25">Has nothing prodigiously unusual about it .</l>
     <l n="26">Really and truly ,</l>
     <l n="27">One is always hearing about you .</l>
     <l n="28">One is , believe me .</l>
     <l n="29">For example , the paragraph writers assure me</l>
     <l n="30">That Everybody is reading</l>
     <l n="31">Miss So-and-So 's great novel ;</l>
     <l n="32">Also , that Everybody will join with them</l>
     <l n="33">In congratulating Miss So-and-So on her approaching marriage ;</l>
     <l n="34">Also , that Everybody is in the Highlands ,</l>
     <l n="35">That Everybody anticipates a good season ,</l>
     <l n="36">That Everybody keeps a houseboat ,</l>
     <l n="37">That Everybody sups at the Carlton after the theatre ,</l>
     <l n="38">That Everybody recognises in Lord Salisbury a great statesman ,</l>
     <l n="39">That Everybody plays golf ,</l>
     <l n="40">That Everybody who can afford it dresses well ,</l>
     <l n="41">That Everybody knows the King has tact ,</l>
     <l n="42">That Everybody thinks the Queen grows younger as she grows older ,</l>
     <l n="43">That Everybody hopes Sir Thomas Lipton</l>
     <l n="44">Will win the America Cup ,</l>
     <l n="45">And so on .</l>
     <l n="46">Which is well .</l>
     <l n="47">I do n't mind in the least .</l>
     <l n="48">Why should I ?</l>
     <l n="49">Yet , if I were Everybody ,</l>
     <l n="50">I imagine that I should not do things</l>
     <l n="51">Quite in the same way that you do them .</l>
     <l n="52">To my mind , your great defect is that you do things</l>
     <l n="53">Not because you like to do them ,</l>
     <l n="54">But simply because</l>
     <l n="55">Everybody does them .</l>
     <l n="56">This is an excellent reason</l>
     <l n="57">From your point of view ;</l>
     <l n="58">But to me it seems a trifle stupid .</l>
     <l n="59">Who is reading Miss So-and-So 's book ?</l>
     <l n="60">Everybody .</l>
     <l n="61">Why are they reading it ?</l>
     <l n="62">Because Everybody is reading it .</l>
     <l n="63">Do they like Miss So-and-So 's book ?</l>
     <l n="64">They are not quite sure .</l>
     <l n="65">But Everybody says it is good ,</l>
     <l n="66">And therefore Everybody must read it .</l>
     <l n="67">Why are frock-coats worn ?</l>
     <l n="68">Because Everybody wears them .</l>
     <l n="69">Why does Everybody wear them ?</l>
     <l n="70">Because Everybody wears them .</l>
     <l n="71">Why does Everybody dine at a certain restaurant ?</l>
     <l n="72">Because Everybody dines there .</l>
     <l n="73">Why does Everybody dine there ?</l>
     <l n="74">Because Everybody dines there .</l>
     <l n="75">Why does ——</l>
     <l n="76">But , there ,</l>
     <l n="77">I forbear .</l>
     <l n="78">Did time allow I might multiply instances</l>
     <l n="79">Till Everybody felt bored ,</l>
     <l n="80">But I stay min ’ hand ;</l>
     <l n="81">Enough , you know , is as good as a feast ;</l>
     <l n="82">Likewise , better a stalled ox</l>
     <l n="83">Than a dinner of herbs ;</l>
     <l n="84">Everybody says so ,</l>
     <l n="85">Wherefore I am constrained to believe it .</l>
     <l n="86">By way of conclusion , let us ask ourselves</l>
     <l n="87">What is happening just now .</l>
     <l n="88">Everybody says</l>
     <l n="89">That nothing is happening just now ,</l>
     <l n="90">And that everything is frightfully dull ;</l>
     <l n="91">And</l>
     <l n="92">Everybody</l>
     <l n="93">Is</l>
     <l n="94">Quite</l>
     <l n="95">Right .</l>
