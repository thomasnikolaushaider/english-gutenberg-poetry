       <l n="1">Thrice in the night the priest arose</l>
       <l n="2">From broken sleep to kneel and pray .</l>
       <l n="3">“ Hush , poor ghost , till the red cock crows ,</l>
       <l n="4">And I a Mass for your soul may say .”</l>

       <l n="7">His brother lay , his beads he told ,</l>
       <l n="8">And “ Rest , poor spirit , rest ,” he said .</l>

       <l n="10">Before the morning bell should toll ;</l>
       <l n="11">But still he heard — and woke to weep —</l>
       <l n="12">The crying of his brother ’ s soul .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">All through the dark , till dawn was pale ,</l>

       <l n="21">The priest before the altar stands ,</l>

      <head>THE SUICIDE ’ S GRAVE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">This is the scene of a man ’ s despair , and a soul ’ s release</l>
       <l n="2">From the difficult traits of the flesh ; so , it seeking peace ,</l>
       <l n="3">A shot rang out in the night ; death ’ s doors were wide ;</l>
       <l n="4">And you stood alone , a stranger , and saw inside .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Coward flesh , brave soul , which was it ? One feared the world ,</l>

       <l n="7">All on the balance of Chance for a state unknown ;</l>

       <l n="9">Perhaps when the hot blood streamed on the daisied sod ,</l>

       <l n="15">When the waves shake the shuddering shore with their foamy jaws ;</l>
