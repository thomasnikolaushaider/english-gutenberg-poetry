       <l n="2">‘ Tis All Souls ’ Night and the great Christ Church bell ,</l>
       <l n="3">And many a lesser bell , sound through the room ,</l>
       <l n="4">For it is now midnight ;</l>
       <l n="5">And two long glasses brimmed with muscatel</l>
       <l n="6">Bubble upon the table . A ghost may come ,</l>
       <l n="7">For it is a ghost 's right ,</l>
       <l n="8">His element is so fine</l>
       <l n="9">Being sharpened by his death ,</l>
       <l n="10">To drink from the wine-breath</l>
       <l n="11">While our gross palates drink from the whole wine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="12">I need some mind that , if the cannon sound</l>
       <l n="13">From every quarter of the world , can stay</l>
       <l n="14">Wound in mind 's pondering ,</l>
       <l n="15">As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound ;</l>
       <l n="16">Because I have a marvellous thing to say ,</l>
       <l n="17">A certain marvellous thing</l>
       <l n="18">None but the living mock ,</l>
       <l n="19">Though not for sober ear ;</l>
       <l n="20">It may be all that hear</l>
       <l n="21">Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="22">H — ‘ s the first I call . He loved strange thought</l>
       <l n="23">And knew that sweet extremity of pride</l>
       <l n="24">That 's called platonic love ,</l>
       <l n="25">And that to such a pitch of passion wrought</l>
       <l n="26">Nothing could bring him , when his lady died ,</l>
       <l n="27">Anodyne for his love .</l>
       <l n="28">Words were but wasted breath ;</l>
       <l n="29">One dear hope had he :</l>
       <l n="30">The inclemency</l>
       <l n="31">Of that or the next winter would be death .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="32">Two thoughts were so mixed up I could not tell</l>
       <l n="33">Whether of her or God he thought the most ,</l>
       <l n="34">But think that his mind 's eye ,</l>
       <l n="35">When upward turned , on one sole image fell ,</l>
       <l n="36">And that a slight companionable ghost ,</l>
       <l n="37">Wild with divinity ,</l>
       <l n="38">Had so lit up the whole</l>
       <l n="39">Immense miraculous house ,</l>
       <l n="40">The Bible promised us ,</l>
       <l n="41">It seemed a gold-fish swimming in a bowl .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="42">On Florence Emery I call the next ,</l>
       <l n="43">Who finding the first wrinkles on a face</l>
       <l n="44">Admired and beautiful ,</l>
       <l n="45">And knowing that the future would be vexed</l>
       <l n="46">With ‘ minished beauty , multiplied commonplace ,</l>
       <l n="47">Preferred to teach a school ,</l>
       <l n="48">Away from neighbour or friend</l>
       <l n="49">Among dark skins , and there</l>
       <l n="50">Permit foul years to wear</l>
       <l n="51">Hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="52">Before that end much had she ravelled out</l>
       <l n="53">From a discourse in figurative speech</l>
       <l n="54">By some learned Indian</l>
       <l n="55">On the soul 's journey . How it is whirled about ,</l>
       <l n="56">Wherever the orbit of the moon can reach ,</l>
       <l n="57">Until it plunged into the sun ;</l>
       <l n="58">And there free and yet fast ,</l>
       <l n="59">Being both Chance and Choice ,</l>
       <l n="60">Forget its broken toys</l>
       <l n="61">And sink into its own delight at last .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="62">And I call up MacGregor from the grave ,</l>
       <l n="63">For in my first hard springtime we were friends ,</l>
       <l n="64">Although of late estranged .</l>
       <l n="65">I thought him half a lunatic , half knave ,</l>
       <l n="66">And told him so , but friendship never ends ;</l>
       <l n="67">And what if mind seem changed ,</l>
       <l n="68">And it seem changed with the mind ,</l>
       <l n="69">When thoughts rise up unbid</l>
       <l n="70">On generous things that he did</l>
       <l n="71">And I grow half contented to be blind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="72">He had much industry at setting out ,</l>
       <l n="73">Much boisterous courage , before loneliness</l>
       <l n="74">Had driven him crazed ;</l>
       <l n="75">For meditations upon unknown thought</l>
       <l n="76">Make human intercourse grow less and less ;</l>
       <l n="77">They are neither paid nor praised .</l>
       <l n="78">But he 'd object to the host ,</l>
       <l n="79">The glass because my glass ;</l>
       <l n="80">A ghost-lover he was</l>
       <l n="81">And may have grown more arrogant being a ghost .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="82">But names are nothing . What matter who it be ,</l>
       <l n="83">So that his elements have grown so fine</l>
       <l n="84">The fume of muscatel</l>
       <l n="85">Can give his sharpened palate ecstasy</l>
       <l n="86">No living man can drink from the whole wine .</l>
       <l n="87">I have mummy truths to tell</l>
       <l n="88">Whereat the living mock ,</l>
       <l n="89">Though not for sober ear ,</l>
       <l n="90">For maybe all that hear</l>
       <l n="91">Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="92">Such thought — such thought have I that hold it tight</l>
       <l n="93">Till meditation master all its parts ,</l>
       <l n="94">Nothing can stay my glance</l>
       <l n="95">Until that glance run in the world 's despite</l>
       <l n="96">To where the damned have howled away their hearts ,</l>
       <l n="97">And where the blessed dance ;</l>
       <l n="98">Such thought , that in it bound</l>
       <l n="99">I need no other thing</l>
       <l n="100">Wound in mind 's wandering ,</l>
       <l n="101">As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound .</l>

      <head>SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF A BLACK CENTAUR</head>
       <l n="1">Your hooves have stamped at the black margin of the wood ,</l>
       <l n="2">Even where the horrible green parrots call and swing .</l>
       <l n="3">My works are all stamped down into the sultry mud .</l>
       <l n="4">I knew that horse play , knew it for a murderous thing .</l>
       <l n="5">What wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food to eat</l>
       <l n="6">And that alone , yet I being driven half insane</l>
       <l n="7">Because of some green wing , gathered old mummy wheat</l>
       <l n="8">In the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain</l>
       <l n="9">And after baked it slowly in an oven ; but now</l>
       <l n="10">I bring full flavoured wine out of a barrel found</l>
       <l n="11">Where seven Ephesian topers slept and never knew</l>
       <l n="12">When Alexander 's empire past , they slept so sound .</l>
       <l n="13">Stretch out your limbs and sleep a long Saturnian sleep ;</l>
       <l n="14">I have loved you better than my soul for all my words ,</l>
       <l n="15">And there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep</l>
       <l n="16">Unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="1">
        <l n="1">Many ingenious lovely things are gone</l>
        <l n="2">That seemed sheer miracle to the multitude ;</l>
        <l n="3">Above the murderous treachery of the moon</l>
        <l n="4">Or all that wayward ebb and flow . There stood</l>
        <l n="5">Amid the ornamental bronze and stone</l>
        <l n="6">An ancient image made of olive wood ;</l>
        <l n="7">And gone are Phidias ’ carven ivories</l>
        <l n="8">And all his golden grasshoppers and bees .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="2">
        <l n="9">We too had many pretty toys when young ;</l>
        <l n="10">A law indifferent to blame or praise</l>
        <l n="11">To bribe or threat ; habits that made old wrong</l>
        <l n="12">Melt down , as it were wax in the sun 's rays ;</l>
        <l n="13">Public opinion ripening for so long</l>
        <l n="14">We thought it would outlive all future days .</l>
        <l n="15">O what fine thought we had because we thought</l>
        <l n="16">That the worst rogues and rascals had died out .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="17">All teeth were drawn , all ancient tricks unlearned ,</l>

        <l n="20">Into a ploughshare ; parliament and king</l>
        <l n="21">Thought that unless a little powder burned</l>
        <l n="22">The trumpeters might burst with trumpeting</l>
        <l n="23">And yet it lack all glory ; and perchance</l>

        <l n="28">To crawl in her own blood , and go scot-free ;</l>
        <l n="29">The night can sweat with terror as before</l>
        <l n="30">We pieced our thoughts into philosophy ,</l>
        <l n="31">And planned to bring the world under a rule</l>
        <l n="32">Who are but weasels fighting in a hole .</l>

        <l n="36">Whether health , wealth or peace of mind were spent</l>
        <l n="37">On master work of intellect or hand ,</l>
        <l n="38">No honour leave its mighty monument ,</l>
        <l n="39">Has but one comfort left : all triumph would</l>

       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="41">And other comfort were a bitter wound :</l>
        <l n="42">To be in love and love what vanishes .</l>
        <l n="43">Greeks were but lovers ; all that country round</l>
        <l n="44">None dared admit , if such a thought were his ,</l>
        <l n="45">Incendiary or bigot could be found</l>
        <l n="46">To burn that stump on the Acropolis ,</l>
        <l n="47">Or break in bits the famous ivories</l>

     <p>NOTE ON ‘ THOUGHTS UPON THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD ’ SECTION SIX .</p>
     <p>The country people see at times certain apparitions whom they name now ‘ fallen angels ’ now ‘ ancient inhabitants of the country , ’ and describe as riding at whiles ‘ with flowers upon the heads of the horses . ’ I have assumed in the sixth poem that these horsemen , now that the times worsen , give way to worse . My last symbol Robert Artisson was an evil spirit much run after in Kilkenny at the start of the fourteenth century . Are not those who travel in the whirling dust also in the Platonic Year ?— W . B. Y .</p>

     <head>NOTE ON THE NEW END TO ‘ THE KING 'S THRESHOLD ’</head>
     <p>Upon the revival of this play at the Abbey Theatre a few weeks ago it was played with this new end . There were a few other changes . I had originally intended to end the play tragically and would have done so but for a friend who used to say ‘ O do write comedy &amp; have a few happy moments in the Theatre . ’ My unhappy moments were because a tragic effect is very fragile and a wrong intonation , or even a wrong light or costume will spoil it all . However the play remained always of the nature of tragedy and so subject to vicissitude .</p>
     <p>Here ends , ‘ Seven Poems and a Fragment : ’ by William Butler Yeats : with a decoration by T. Sturge Moore . Five hundred copies of this book have been printed and published by Elizabeth Corbet Yeats on paper made in Ireland , at the Cuala Press , Churchtown , Dundrum , in the County of Dublin , Ireland . Finished in the third week of April in the year nineteen hundred and twenty-two .</p>
