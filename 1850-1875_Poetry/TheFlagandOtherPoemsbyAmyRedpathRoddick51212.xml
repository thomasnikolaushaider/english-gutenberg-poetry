     <item>The people of the British lands Are masters of their future fate , By effort of their mind and hands They glorify their Empire State , And , as the bud of thought expands , Can make new laws by calm debate .</item>
     <item>The British Empire , may it be The nucleus of that larger league , Uniting every land and sea , Eschewing wars and false intrigue , May common sense and kindness be The crowning glory of that league !</item>

     <l n="5">Dear to those who ’ ve trod the heather ,</l>
     <l n="6">Dear to those who love the rose ,</l>
     <l n="7">Blending Irish cross and nation</l>

     <l n="9">In a just and fair relation ,</l>
     <l n="10">Bears no emblem of the men ,</l>
     <l n="11">First to cross the stormy ocean ,</l>
     <l n="12">Bringing faith and plough and pen ,</l>
     <l n="13">First to know with deep emotion ,</l>
     <l n="14">Canada ! thy name , as home .</l>
     <l n="15">True , provincial arms commingle</l>
     <l n="16">On thy flag o ’ er ships that roam ;</l>
     <l n="17">In their stead an emblem single ,</l>
     <l n="18">Maple leaf of golden hue ,</l>
     <l n="19">Would announce to all more proudly</l>
     <l n="20">Whence thy ships their anchors drew ;</l>
     <l n="21">Would announce to all more loudly ,</l>
     <l n="22">Canada ! thy nation ’ s life ;</l>
     <l n="23">And on land , when bells are ringing</l>
     <l n="24">To acclaim the end of strife ,</l>
     <l n="25">When with joy each heart is singing ;</l>
     <l n="26">Canada ! is this thy flag ?</l>

   <p>[ A ] The name of “ Newfoundland ” is never pronounced by its inhabitants or their neighbors of the Maritime Provinces with the accent on the middle syllable , as is the usage elsewhere . It is pronounced as though written “ Newf ’ n ’ land ,” with the principal stress on the last syllable .</p>

    <head>IN FORT-BOUND METZ .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">July 26th , 1914 .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Neat uniformed , with close cropped head and fierce moustache ,</l>
     <l n="3">Near us they dined one July day in fort-bound Metz .</l>
     <l n="4">We could not catch their words ; but we could see and feel</l>
     <l n="5">Their strong excitement , breaking forth , then held in check ,</l>
     <l n="6">Then breaking forth afresh as some new health was drunk .</l>
     <l n="7">The joy , imprinted on their faces , spread to ours .</l>
     <l n="8">We laughed in turn as they ; but knew not why we laughed .</l>
     <l n="9">It was indeed a merry meal in which we shared ,</l>
     <l n="10">That July day , in fort-bound Metz .</l>
     <l n="11">Next day , in France , we were to know at what we laughed</l>
     <l n="12">With those large built , full blooded German men of rank ,</l>
     <l n="13">For when we asked a grieving woman why she wept ,</l>
     <l n="14">She sobbed : “ Because the Germans will make war on France !”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE CALM THAT COMES WITH YEARS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I cannot write of turmoil , I cannot write of strife ,</l>
     <l n="2">Long since has gone the passion , I used to think was life .</l>
     <l n="3">A calmness rests upon me , a calm I cannot break ,</l>
     <l n="4">Though worlds are trembling round me and freedom is at stake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Because I have no sorrows , because my heart ’ s at rest ,</l>
     <l n="6">I cannot weep with others , whose hearts are not so blest ;</l>
     <l n="7">I tremble for no hero upon the fields of France ,</l>
     <l n="8">I cannot curse the Nero who planned this gory dance .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Though woman fast is winning her place in Council Halls ,</l>
     <l n="10">By work where talent leads her , by work where mercy calls ,</l>
     <l n="11">I feel no keen elation to know her triumph ’ s near ,</l>
     <l n="12">A triumph most unselfish , a heavier weight to bear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The calm that rests upon me , the calm that comes with years ,</l>
     <l n="14">Suggests that man ’ s impatience is the cause of most he fears ,</l>
     <l n="15">Suggests that war ’ s upheaval is but the anvil clink ,</l>
     <l n="16">The welding by the Forger of yet another link</l>
     <l n="17">In that great chain of progress that binds successive time ,</l>
     <l n="18">From chaos on to order , and then to heights sublime !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>GOING WEST .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A pulsing silence shrouds me round</l>
     <l n="2">Like waves one feels , but hears no sound ,</l>
     <l n="3">Then slowly , as from realms above ,</l>
     <l n="4">There come soft whispered words of love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And something presses on my heart ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of my own self it seems a part ,</l>
     <l n="7">So very close I feel — her head —</l>
     <l n="8">And now I know she is not dead !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I try to break the secret charm</l>
     <l n="10">That weighs upon my nerveless arm ,</l>
     <l n="11">I want to hold my love so close</l>
     <l n="12">She will not wander whilst I doze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">I think I fell asleep ,</l>
     <l n="14">The silence seemed more deep ,</l>
     <l n="15">I could not catch the beat</l>
     <l n="16">The noiseless waves repeat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Again there comes that soundless sound ,</l>
     <l n="18">The heavy , ceaseless , rythmic pound .</l>
     <l n="19">Is it the throb of worlds alive ?</l>
     <l n="20">Is it the hum of some near hive ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">My own tired pulse may be the cause</l>
     <l n="22">Of what is more like faint applause ,</l>
     <l n="23">Of what might be a funeral drum</l>
     <l n="24">So muffled to be almost dumb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">But no , that pressure on my heart</l>
     <l n="26">Reminds me , with a sudden dart</l>
     <l n="27">Of pain , so keen it seems to thrill ,</l>
     <l n="28">That my dear love is by me still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">And now I understand</l>
     <l n="30">The meaning of that band ,</l>
     <l n="31">Her heart is beating time</l>
     <l n="32">In unison with mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">Again those words of love I hear ,</l>
     <l n="34">But now they are so very near ,</l>
     <l n="35">They ’ re telling me of deeds I ’ ve done</l>
     <l n="36">And of the wished for cross I ’ ve won !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">So after all my life ’ s not lost ,</l>
     <l n="38">Amidst that fiery holocaust ,</l>
     <l n="39">I ’ ve done what I was meant to do ,</l>
     <l n="40">What matter if the fight ’ s not through !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">My little love your head is pressed</l>
     <l n="42">Too close upon my burning breast ,</l>
     <l n="43">And yet it seems , that while you press ,</l>
     <l n="44">The pain is growing less and less .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">Perhaps I ’ m going west ,</l>
     <l n="46">I ’ m tired , I want to rest ,</l>
     <l n="47">My breathing ’ s slow and deep ,</l>
     <l n="48">I ’ m sinking fast asleep —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">In shell tossed No Man ’ s Land they saw him , lying</l>
     <l n="50">Unconscious , smiling in his sleep , but dying —</l>
     <l n="51">His broken arm hung limp , a mortal wound</l>
     <l n="52">Gaped wide above his heart , on which they found ,</l>
     <l n="53">Tight pressed , the picture of his youthful bride ,</l>
     <l n="54">Whose grave is swept by ocean ’ s restless tide .</l>

     <l n="6">Void of blissful hopes together spanned ,</l>
     <l n="7">Hopes of service in assuaging others ’ sorrows ,</l>
     <l n="8">Hopes of varied joys together planned ?</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="9">No , these heavy mourning weeds I ’ ll cast asunder ,</l>
     <l n="10">Struggle through the clouds that wrap me round ,</l>
     <l n="11">Close my ears to their unholy , fearsome thunder ,</l>

     <l n="13">Perfect spirit , now I know that thou art near me ;</l>

     <l n="1">The silver birch , on the mountain top , laughed for sheer joy of being</l>
     <l n="2">alive !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She looked down on the valley and saw the peaceful farms and the green meadow , where man ’ s only labour was driving a ball from hole to hole , and beyond she saw the gentle slopes of wooded hills and the pure gold of the setting sun and she was happy , for was not all this created just for her !</p>
   <p>So she laughed , and every leaf fluttered for joy !</p>
   <p>THE FLOWER OF TRUE HAPPINESS .</p>
   <p>The Flower of Happiness grows in the fields of the Poor and in the gardens of the Rich and may be gathered by all who want it and have the will to reach for it . It hangs high up on the Tree of Life though , and many never see it at all . They are so busy digging for gold or weeping over graves , they forget to look up . Even amongst those who do see it many are afraid to pluck it , fearing its beauty and fragrance might injure their souls . Others strive for it ; but the rock , on which they stand , is so overlaid with greed and lust that , when the Flower is within their reach , they slip , clutching but a broken stalk .</p>
   <p>A few only , with their feet firmly planted on the plane of moderation and their faces turned towards God , gather this wondrous Flower . At moments it may wilt ; but the true Flower always revives , and whiffs of its sweetness go to gladden many hearts as they , who have plucked it , walk amongst their fellow-men .</p>

    <head>THE MOUNTAIN TOP .</head>
    <head>A man of mature years and thoughtful mien was slowly ascending the mountain slopes when he met the good minister , with prayer book under arm , on his way to church .</head>
     <l n="1">“ My dear sir ,” said the latter , “ your steps have passed the House of</l>
     <l n="2">God , and this the Sabbath morn !”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The other answered : “ The house of man , you mean . I go to the House of God , the mountain top , with its foundation of finite rock and its roof of infinite space ; and there , from the finite my soul aspires to the infinite , from sin to perfection , from the known to the ideal , from disorder to harmony , from man to God .”</p>
   <p>“ This too , I preach ,” said the good minister .</p>
   <p>“ And so do the Rabbi , the Brahman and the priests of the many religions and sects of this world ,” replied the other . “ But each explains the great mystery in his own way and the many ways confuse me and so , as alone I must one day meet my God , alone now I seek Him on the mountain top .”</p>
   <p>“ Let not our many ways trouble you ,” said the good minister , with a kindly smile . “ If you really have our common goal in your heart , you need not climb to the mountain top to find the House of God ; because then you will know it is everywhere , as God is everywhere !”</p>
   <p>CHARITY .</p>
   <p>A lovable and beautiful maid was Charity , yet withal thoughtless and somewhat vain . She was admired and “ God-blessed ” by all men , for what beggar did she ever repulse ! And for each coin she dropped into a beggar ’ s hand , what treasure was she not storing up for herself in the wonderful kingdom to come !</p>
   <p>But some of the beggars began to whisper among themselves that it was not fair that she should receive such great reward for doing so very little , and that the scattered coins vanished almost as soon as they touched their outstretched hands , and that misery was everywhere .</p>
   <p>At last these murmurings reached Charity herself and they bewildered her . So she looked more closely at the beggars and she saw here a blind one , there a lame one , and many , many who were sick and weary , and her heart was touched . So she came down from her pedestal and soothed and comforted the needy , even finding cures for a few of them . Now she was admired and loved more than ever , and greater than ever she felt was that future reward she was heaping up for herself .</p>
   <p>But some of the beggars again began to whisper that everything was not right , that perhaps after all it was not Charity they wanted , and again Charity heard , and she looked at the beggars yet more closely and she found in every face the promise of something better , if she could but reach it . So she called all the Sciences and all the Arts to her aid and for long they communed together . Then the Sciences and the Arts went to work , accompanied by a sweet and perfect Charity , who now sought her only reward in her power to serve and to love , and they found the roots of the many evils that beset the world and one by one they destroyed them .</p>
   <p>No angry whisperings now , no gruesome beggars more ; but soft laughter and willing helpers everywhere abound .</p>
