     <item>MYSTERY OF CARMEL .</item>
     <item>The Mission floor was with weeds o'ergrown , And crumbling and shaky its walls of stone ; Its roof of tiles , in tiers and tiers , Had stood the storms of a hundred years . An olden , weird , medieval style Clung to the mouldering , gloomy pile , And the rhythmic voice of the breaking waves Sang a lonesome dirge in its land of graves . As I walked in the Mission old and gray — The Mission Carmel at Monterey .</item>
     <item>An ancient owl went fluttering by , Scared from his haunt . His mournful cry Wakened the echoes , till roof and wall Caught and re-echoed the dismal call Again and again , till it seemed to me Some Jesuit soul , in mockery — Stripped of rosary , gown , and cowl — Haunted the place , in this dreary owl . Surely I shivered with fright that day , Alone in the Mission , old and gray — The Mission Carmel at Monterey .</item>
     <item>Near the chapel vault was a dungeon grim , And they say that many a chanted hymn Has rung a knell on the moldy air For luckless errant prisoned there , As kneeling monk and pious nun Sang orison at set of sun . A single window , dark and small , Showed opening in the heavy wall , Nor other entrance seemed attained That erst had human footstep gained . I paused before the uncanny place And peered me into its darksome space . Had it of secret aught to tell , That locked up darkness kept it well . I turned , and lo ! by my side there stood A being of strangest naturehood . Startled , I glanced him o'er and o'er , Wondering I noted him not before . His form was stooped with the weight of years , And on his cheek was a trace of tears ; Over all his face a shade of pain That deepened and vanished , and came again . Fixed he his woeful eyes on me — Through my very soul they seemed to see . And lightly he laid his hand on mine — His hand was cold as the vestal shrine . “ ‘ Tis haunted , ” he said , “ haunted , and he Who dares at night-noon go with me To this cursed place , by phantoms trod , Must fear not devil , man , nor God . ” “ Tell me the story , ” I cried , “ tell me ! ” And frightened was I at my bravery . A curious smile his thin lips curved , That well had my bravery unnerved . And this is the story he told that day To me in the Mission old and gray — The Mission Carmel at Monterey .</item>
     <item>“ Each midnight , since have seventy years Begun their cycle around the spheres , Two faces have looked from that window there . One is a woman 's , young and fair , With tender eyes and floating hair . Love , and regret , and dumb despair , Are told in each tint of the fair sweet face . The other is crowned with a courtly grace , Gazing , with all a lover 's pride , On the beautiful woman by his side . Anon ! a change flits o'er his mien , And baffled rage in his glance is seen . Paler they grow as the hours go by , With the pallor that comes with the summons to die . Slowly fading , and shrinking away , Clutched in the grasp of a gaunt decay , Till the herald of morn on the sky is thrown ; Then a shriek , a curse , and a dying moan , Comes from that death-black window there . A mocking laugh rings out on the air , From that darkful place , in the nascent dawn , And the faces that looked from the window are gone . Seventy years , when the Spanish flag Floated above yon beetling crag , And this dearthful mission place was rife With the panoply of busy life ; Hard by , where yon canyon , deep and wide , Sweeps it adown the mountain side , A cavalier dwelt with his beautiful bride . Oft to the priestal shrive went she ; As often , stealthily , followed he . The padre Sanson absolved and blessed The penitent , and the sin-distressed , Nor ever before won devotee So wondrous a reverence as he . A-night , when the winds played wild and high , And the ocean rocked it to the sky , An earthquake trembled the shore along , Hushing on lip of praise its song , And jarred to its center this Mission strong . When the morning broke with a summer sun , The earth was at rest , the storm was done . Still the Mission tower 'd in its stately pride ; Still the cottage smiled by the canyon-side ; But never the priest was there to bless , And the cottage roof was tenantless . Vainly they sought for the padre , dead , For the cottage dwellers ; amazed , they said ‘ Twas a miracle ; but since that day There 's a ghost in the Mission old and gray — The Mission Carmel of Monterey</item>
     <item>“ A sequel there is to that tale , ” said he , “ Of the way and the truth I hold the key . ” “ Show me the way , ” I cried , “ Show me To the depth of this curious mystery ! ” He waved me to follow ; my heart stood still Under the ban of a mightier will Than mine . A terror of icy chill O'erhYpppHeNshivered my being from hand to brain , Freezing the blood in each pulsing vein , As I followed this most mysterious guide Through the solid floor at the chancel side , Into a passage whose stifling breath Reeked with the pestilence of death . Down through a subterranean vault , Over broken steps with never a halt , Till we stood in the midst of a spacious room , A charnel-house in its shroud of gloom . Only a window , narrow and small , Left in the build of the heavy wall , Through which the flickering sunbeams died , Showed passway to the world outside . Slowly my eyes to the darkness grew , And I saw in the gloom , or rather knew , That my feet had touched two skeleton forms , One closely clasped in the other 's arms . Recoiling , I shuddered and turned my face From the fleshless mockery of embrace . Again o'er a heap of rubbish and rust , I stumbled and caught in the moth and dust What hardly a sense of my soul believes — A mold-stained package of parchment leaves ! A hideous bat flapped into my face ! O'ercome with horror , I fled the place , And stood again with my curious guide On the solid floor , at the chancel 's side . But , lo ! in a moment the age-bowed seer Was a darkly frowning cavalier , Gazing no longer in woeful trance , Vengeance blazed in his every glance . Then a mocking laugh rang the Mission o'er , And I stood alone by the chapel door ; And , save for the mold-stained parchment leaves , I had thought it the vision that night-mare weaves . Hardly a sense of my soul believes , Yet I held in my hand the parchment leaves . Careful I noted them , one by one , Each was a letter in rhyming run , Written over and over , in tenderest strain , By fingers that never will write again . I strung them together , a tale to tell , And named it “ The Mystery of Carmel . ” And these are the letters I found that day , In the mission ruin , old and gray — The Mission Carmel of Monterey :</item>

    <p>TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON Oh , holy father , list thee to my prayer ! I may not kneel to thee as others kneel , And tell my heart-aches with the suppliant 's air , But fiercer burns the fire I must conceal . My soul is groping in the mists of doubt , The sunlight and the shadows all are gone , Only a cold , gray cloud my life 's about , Nor ever vision of a fairer dawn . A father ne'er my brow in loving smoothed , Nor taught my baby tongue to lisp his name ; No mother 's voice my childish sorrows soothed , Nor sought my wild , imperious will to tame . Yet ran my life , like some bright bubbling spring , Too full of thoughtless happiness to care If that the future might more gladness bring , Or might its skies be clouded or be fair . Afar upon the purple hills of Spain — Since waned the moons of half a year ago — I sported , reckless as the laughing main , Nor dreamed in life a thought of grief to know . To-day I pine here in a chain whose gall Is bitterer than drop of wormwood brought From that salt sea where nothing lives , and all The recompense my willfulness has brought . Oh , holy father , list thee to my prayer ! And though I may not kneel as others kneel , And tell my heart-aches with a suppliant air , I crave they grace a sickened soul to heal .</p>

     <p>Here , close beside this sacred font of gold , My humble prayer , oh , father , I will lay , With all its weight of misery untold ; And wait impatient that which thou wilt say REVENITA .</p>
    </epigraph>
   </titlePage>
   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO REVENITA When to the font , this morn , my lips I pressed , A fairy 's gift my fingers trembled o'er ; A sweeter prayer ne'er smile of angel blessed , Nor gemmed a tiar that the priesthood wore . The secret of they grief I may not know , Since that thy lips refuse the tale to tell ; Methinks , dear child , it was the sound of woe That woke an echo in my heart 's deep well . The wail of a spirit that a-yearning gropes In darkness for the sunlight that is fled ; A broken idol in secret wept , and hopes — Crushed hopes — that are to thee as are the dead . A tender memory ling'ring yet of when Each bounding pulse beat faster with its joy ; A something that allured , and won , and then With waking fled , and years may not destroy The impress which it left upon thy brain But seek thee , child , grief 's ravaging to stay ? Thy tears might fall as falls the show'ring rain , They could not wash the heart 's deep scars away .</p>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO SANSON Oh , would the fairies to her whisper The truths which they to him impart , Teach her a beautiful hereafter , A Heaven to bless a tired heart . Yet thinks she that the dear ones waiting Would envy not the boon she craves — To rear fair friendship 's sacred alter Where love and hope sleep in their graves . She knows not that a loving welcome Will wait her in a realm of light , Nought of a future meeting whispers , No faith illumes her soul 's dark night . But oh ! she knows , has by experience , The saddest of all lessons learned ; Knows that she gathered dead-sea apples , Which in her hands to ashes turned . She knows into a trammelled torrent , Is changed her life 's free flowing tide ; Knows that her hand no oar is holding , With which her drifting bark to guide . She knows , yes , knows that , like the mirage , Which for the thirsty traveler gleamed , The sweet ideal she fondly cherished Was never there ; it only seemed . If what she knows is to her proven A false , deluding , fleeting show , Can she , generous spirit , can she Trust blindly what she does not know ?</p>

    <p>TO SANSON They boast of Ormuz 's milk-white pearls , The ruby 's magic art , And proudly wear the crystal drop That fires the diamond 's heart . And these may admiration claim , And countless wealth may sway , But rarer gem was given to me , One golden summer day . Its wondrous tints , a brilliant glow , Emit in darkest gloom , A sweeter fragrance ‘ round it clings , Than breath of eastern bloom . Were all earth 's costly jewels thrown In one great glittering heap , They could not buy for ev'n a day The gem I 'd selfish keep . Yet ‘ twas not won from pearly depths , Nor gleaned from diamond mine , Nor all the chemist 's subtlety Its substance could define . It ne'er was set in band of fold Some dainty hand to grace , Ne'er shone in diadem to deck A brow of kingly race . For me alone , a wizard spell Lies prisoned in its beams , Hours of enchanted ecstacy And days of Eden dreams .</p>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO SANSON I 've a beautiful home , where I live in my dreams , So joyous and happy — an Eden it seems ; All beautiful things in nature and are Are blending to rapture the mind and the heart ; No discords to jar , no dissensions arise , ‘ Tis calm as Italia 's ever blue skies , When kissed by the bright rosy blush of the morn ; And a voice of the spheres on the breezes is borne , Soft as the murmur of sea-tinted shells , Sweet as the chiming of far away bells ; And grief cannot enter , nor trouble nor care , And the proud peerless prince of my soul , he is there .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <epigraph>
     <p>In my beautiful home from the cold world apart , He holds me so close to his fast beating heart ; More enchanting his voice than the syren-wrapt song , O'er the wind-dimpled ocean soft floating along , As he whispers his love in love 's low passioned tone , Such home , and such lover , no other has known .

     <p>A paradise of love and bliss ! Delicious draughts in Eden bowers , Of peace , and rest , and quiet hours , We 'll drink , for what we 've missed in this . The shafts of malice we 'll defy , And let this foolish world go by . SANSON .</p>

     <p>A desecrated holiness is o'er me , I 've held the Thyrsus cup ; I 've dared the thunderbolts of Heaven for thee , I will not give up . SANSON . World , farewell ! And thou pale tape light , by whose fast-dying flame I write these words — the last my hand shall pen — farewell ! What is't to die ? To be shut in a dungeon 's walls and starved to death ? She knows , and soon will I . She sought to learn of me , and I to teach to her , the mystery of life . Ha , ha ! Who claimed her by the church 's law has given us both to learn the mystery of death . What was't I loved ? The eyes that thrilled me through and through with their magnetic subtlety ? They 're there , set on my face ; but where 's their lifened light ? What was't I loved ? The mouth whose coral redness I have buried in my own ? ‘ Tis there , shrunk ‘ gainst two rows of dead pale pearls , and cold and colorless as lip of statue carved of marble . Was it the form whose perfect outline stamped it with divinity ? It 's there , but ‘ reft of all its winsome roundness , and stiffening in the chill of death . It makes me cold to look upon its rigidness . But just this hour the breath went out ; was't that I loved ? ‘ Twas this I clasped and kissed . What is it that we 've christened love , that glamours men to madness , and stains with falsehood virgin purity ? It made this grewsome charnel vault a part of Heaven — the graves there of those murdered knaves made rests of roses for our heads ; it made him spring the bolt and lock us in . Where is the creed 's foundation ? I 've shrived a thousand souls — I cannot now absolve my own . To quench this awful thirst , I cut an artery in my arm and sucked its blood . The thirstness did not cease . They lied . ‘ Twas not the vultures at Prometeus ’ heart , ‘ twas hunger at his vitals gnawed . The salt drops that I swallowed from that vein have set my brain on fire . What 's that ? The ground 's a-tremble ‘ neath my feet as touched with life . Earth , rend your breast and let me in ! For anything but this dire darkness , made alive with vengeful eye-balls — his eyes ! They glare with hate at me . I heard him laugh but now . For anything but this most loving corpse whose head caressing rests it on my feet . Ah , no , I did not mean it thus ; I would not get away alone . I loved that corpse . It was the sweetest bit of human frailty that to man e'er brought a blessing or a curse . I turned from Dias ’ holy grail to taste its nectar . Hell , throw a-wide your sulphur-blazoned gates , I 'll grasp it in my arms and make the plunge ! Hist ! what was that ? I heard him laugh again . Laugh , fiend , you cannot hurt me more . Ah ! Reyenita , mine in life you were , in death you shall be mine . When this clogged blood has stopped the wheels of life , I 'll put my arms around your neck , I 'll lay my face against your frozen one , and thus I 'll die . When this foul place has crumbled to the sunlight , some relic-hunting lunatic will stumble o'er our bones , and pitiless will weave a tale for eyes more pitiless to read . Back , Stygian ghoul ! Death 's on me now . I feel his rattle in my throat ! My limbs are blocks of ice ! My heart has tuned it with the muffled dead-march drum ! A jar of crashing worlds is in my ears ! A drowsy faintness creeps upon — The seal is broken , the mystery tell ; You have read the letters , what do they tell ? Do they tell you the story they told that day To me , in the Mission old and gray — The Mission Carmel at Monterey ? WASTED HOURS . If that thy hand with heart-will sought , To work with Christ-love underlying , But ere thou hadst accomplished aught Time passed thee by while vainly trying , The wasted hour , the vain endeavor , Will wait thee in the far forever . If thou hadst toiled from dawn till eve , But felt no thrill of joy in giving No heart made glad , no want relieved , Lived but for selfish love of living , Though idle hours went by thee never , The hours are lost to thee forever . ROCKING THE BABY . I hear her rocking the baby — Her room is just next to mine — And I fancy I feel the dimpled arms That round her neck entwine , As she rocks , and rocks the baby , In the room just next to mine . I hear her rocking the baby Each day when the twilight comes , And I know there 's a world of blessing and love In the “ baby bye ” she hums . I can see the restless fingers Playing with “ mamma 's rings , ” And the sweet little smiling , pouting mouth , That to hers in kissing clings , As she rocks and sings to the baby , And dreams as she rocks and sings . I hear her rocking the baby , Slower and slower now , And I know she is leaving her good-night kiss On its eyes , and cheek , and brow From her rocking , rocking , rocking , I wonder would she start , Could she know , through the wall between us , She is rocking on a heart . While my empty arms are aching For a form they may not press And my emptier heart is breaking In its desolate loneliness I list to the rocking , rocking , In the room just next to mine , And breathe a prayer in silence , At a mother 's broken shrine , For the woman who rocks her baby In the room just next to mine . “ I DON'T CARE . ” “ I do n't care , ” we hear it oft And oft , the words are seeming fair ; But many a heartache lies beneath A careless “ I do n't care ! ” In every age , from every tongue , The vain assertions fell ; But oh , trust not the cheating words , For never truth they tell ! Hearts may grow sick with hope deferred , Be crushed with black despair , But lips , too proud to own defeat , Will whisper , “ I do n't care ! ” A thoughtless friend flings out in jest — As jesters always do — A deadly shaft you wince beneath , You know the story 's true ; But while the dart has pierced your heart , And poisoned , rankles there , You look amused , and answer with A smiling , “ I do n't care ! ” When Fortune 's favors are withdrawn , And friends like shadows fled , When all your fondest dreams are gone , Your dearest hopes are dead , You curse the fickle goddess , then , Who wrought you such despair , Yet hide chagrin beneath a frown , And mutter , “ I do n't care ! ” The veteran , battle-scarred , who fills A nation 's honored place , Feels keener than his saber 's point , Unmerited disgrace . With indignation all aflame He meets some rival 's stare ; But for all answer gives the worlds A freezing “ I do n't care ! ” A woman 's heart is trifled with , Her hopes are ground to dust , Her proud soul humbled with neglect , Betrayed her sacred trust , Yet , while to desperation stung , With death and ruin there , She 'll crush the tears and cheat you with A laughing “ I do n't care ? ” “ I do n't care ! ” ‘ tis but a breath , The words are seeming fair , But many a heartache lies beneath A careless “ I do n't care ! ” A STAINED LILY . Some lilies grew by a brook-side , Tall and white , and cold , And lifted up to the sunshine Their great red hearts of gold . And near to their bed grew mosses , rank vines , and flowers small , And loathsome weeds , and thistles , And the sunlight warmed them all . Anon , the proud white lilies Were gathered one by one , Each to crown a festal Rarest under the sun . One lily stooped to the brooklet , Her face she knew was fair , And the face of flowing water Mirrored her image there . A hand upraised in envy , Or carelessness , or jest , Flung from the turbid water , Mud , on the lily 's breast . And all the proud , white lilies Turned their faces away , And nobody plucked that lily , And day , and night , and day She wept for her ruined beauty : And the dew-drops , and the rain , Touched with her tears , in pity Fell on the muddy stain . Still stood she in her grieving Day , and night , and day ; Nor tears , nor dew , nor rain-drops , Could fade the stain away . Pining in desolation , Shunned by each of her kind , Sought she a bitter solace In creatures of a coarser mind . But the breath of the nettle stung her , And the thistle 's rude embrace Burned her sensitive nature , And scarred the fair , stained face . Lower drooped the lily , And died at the feet of the weeds ; And only the tender mosses Ministered to her needs . And still the tall while lilies Stand as cold , and proud , And still the weeds and thistles Against the lilies crowd . Alike the same warm sunbeams , On weed and flower fall , Alike by the same soil nourished , And the great God made them all . A VALENTINE . I love thee for the soul that shines Within thine eyes ’ soft beaming , From out whose depths the prisoned fires Of intellect are gleaming . I love thee for the mind that soars Beyond earth 's narrow keeping , That measures suns , and stars , and worlds , Through boundless limits sweeping . I love thee for the voice whose power Can in my heart awaken To passioned life each slumbering chord The ruder tones have shaken . Thou ne'er , perchance , mayst feel the chain With which this love has bound thee , Nor dream thee of the hand that flung Its glittering links around thee . And vainly mayst thou deem the task Thy captive bounds to sever — Who madly dates to love thee now Will love thee on forever . WHICH ONE . Each was as fair as the other , And both as my life were dear ; And the voices that lisped me mother , Heaven 's music in my ear . One faded from life — and mother , And died in the summer dawn ; And I turned away from the other And wept for the child that was gone . Then I lay in a weird sleep-vision , Before me an earth dark scene , And the land of the sweet Elysian , And only a grave between . One child soft called me mother Out from the shining door , And smile and beckoned ; the other Unconsciously played on the floor . One 's path , to my inward seeing , Was light with a wondrous day , And led to the heights of being , And an angel showed the way . The other lay where Marah 's Hot sands with snares are strewn — Through many a darksome forest , And the way was roughly hewn . A faith to my soul was given — The weird sleep-vision o'er — And I turned from the child in heaven To the child that played on the floor . LIFE 'S WAY . Good-bye , sweetheart , he said , and clasped her hand , And rained his kisses on her tear-wet face ; Then broke away , and in a foreign land . For her dear sake , sought gold , that he might place Love 's jeweled crown upon his queen 's fair brow , And pour his hard-won treasures at her feet ; And swore , than Heaven , than life itself , his vow To her he held more sacred and more sweet . She waited as the woman only may Whose eyes are blinded oft with unshed tears ; Lines on her forehead grew , and threads of gray ; The weary days crept into weary years . “ Oh stars , go down ! Oh sun , be shrouded now ! My love comes not ; he does not live , ” she said ; And brushed the curls he 'd kissed back from her brow , And pout on mourning for her dead . And still as oft the day came round that he Had left his warm good-bye upon her lips , As oft she sought the head-land by sea , And longing watched the far-off white-sailed ships . To-day , the low sand-beach was over-strewn ; Torn sail , and broken spar and human form , ‘ Gulfed by the waves , and crushed , and then out-thrown — A ship went down in yester-night 's wild storm . She walked among the debris , and the dead , As some sweet mercy-sister on her round , Scanning each up-turned face with nameless dread , For aught of life ; her tireless searching found A babe — a waif with tawny tangled locks , And great blue eyes with wonder brimming o'er ; Of all the human freight wrecked on the rocks , The only living thing that washed ashore . A pearl-gemmed golden case upon its breast She oped , then stared , her eyes a-sudden wild , A name , a pictured face told all the rest ; His name — his face — his child ! UNCLE SAM 'S SOLILOQUY . I 'm a century old and more to-day — A ripe old age for a modern man ,— Yet they who rocked my cradle , they say , Predicted a thousand years my span ; They christened me at the fount of prayer , And gave me a star-gemmed robe to wear . My first free breath was battle-smoke A prayerful nurses did not abhor The sounds that first my ear awoke — The clash and din and shout of war . They pressed in my hand a crown of might And pointed my way to the eagle 's flight . Cannon and sword were my playthings to bless , ( Dangerous toys for a babe to try ,) The stirring reveille my more caress , The wild tattoo was my lullaby ; And well , methinks , as they years have run , Have I wrought the work my sires begun . An infant prodigy I , and ere Expired a tenth of my granted day , I wrested from lion-grasp the spear — A nation 's power I held in sway ; I broke the gives from freedom 's graves , And steam and lightning I bound my slaves . I flung my starred robe on the breeze , From burning tropic to arctic cold . On distant isles , in distant seas , A foot-hold gained with sword and gold . Atlantic 's slope and Pacific 's strand I bound together with an iron band . But of late I 've premature grown old ; There 's something wrong with the clothes I wear ; There is something wrong with the helm I hold , Else I hold it wrong ,— there 's wrong somewhere . Disease too has thrown me his poisoned dart ; His workman are “ striking ” right at my heart . My head is so strangely vision thrilled With plans to evade the demon 's stay , But all the plots that my brain have filled Only have served to augment his sway , And on my feet , at the sunset 's door , Is spreading a troublesome grievous sore . I 'm growing ill I can plainly see , And many prescribe my pain to ease , But somehow each medicine proves to be “ A remedy worse than the disease . ” Though strong as ever , should once my strength Give way , I must fall a fearful length . My doctors say they know the cause , And they 've gone to work with eager zest , Probed and expounded with weighty straws , And leeches attached to my troubled breast ; I fee them well , as attests my purse But day after day I 'm growing worse . Though they have not yet touched the cause they knew , And are wrangling over its direful flood , They promise to build me better than new , And stop the drain on my famished blood ; But lest they 're careful while building the dam They 'll scoop out a grave for “ Uncle Sam . ” NAY , DO NOT ASK . Nay , do not ask me , Sweet , if I have loved before , Or if , mayhap , in other years to be , A younger , fairer face than thine I know , I 'll love her more than thee . What should it matter if I 've loved before , So that I love thee now , and love thee best ? What matters it that I should love again If , first , the daisy-buds blow o'er thy breast ? Love has the waywardness of strange caprice , One can not chain it to a recreant heart , Nor , when around the soul its tendrils twine , Can will the clinging , silken bonds to part . It is enough , I hold thee prisoned in my arms , And drink the dewy fragrance of thy breath ; And earth , and heaven , and hades , are forgot , And love holds carnival , and laughs at death . Then do not ask me , Sweet , if I have loved before , Or if some day my heart might turn from thee ; In this brief hour , thou hast my soul of love , And thou are Is , and Was , and May be — all to me . A PICTURE . A little maid , with sweet brown eyes , Upraised to mine in sad surprise ; I held two tiny hands in mine , I kissed the little maid farewell . Her cheeks to deeper crimson flushed , The sweet , shy glances downward fell ; From rosy lips came — ah ! so low — “ I love you , do not go ! ” I see it through the lapse of years — This picture , ofttimes blurred with tears . No tiny hands in mine are held , No sweet brown eyes my pulses wake — Only in memory a voice E'er bids me stay for love 's sweet sake . HANG UP YOUR STOCKING . Laugh , little bright-eyes , hang up your stocking ; Do n't count the days any more ; Old Santa Claus will soon be knocking , Knocking , Knocking at the door . Through the key-hole slyly peeping , Down the chimney careful creeping , When the little folks are sleeping , Comes he with his pack of presents . Such a grin ! but then so pleasant You would never think to fear him ; And you can not , must not hear him . He 's so particular , you know , He 'd just pick up his traps and go If but one little eye should peep That he thought was fast asleep . Searching broomstick , nails , and shelf , Till he finds the little stocking — Softly lest you hear his knocking — Smiling , chuckling to himself , He fills it from his Christmas store , And out he slips to hunt for more . Then laugh , little bright-eyes , and hang up your stocking ; Do n't count the days any more ; Old Santa Claus will soon be knocking , Knocking , Knocking at the door . OPENING THE GATE FOR PAPA . Hurrying out to the gateway Go two little pattering feet ; Eagerly out through the palings Peer two eyes bright and sweet . A footstep as eager is answering The sweet eyes that patiently wait And papa is kissing , and blessing The baby that opens the gate . And every day all the long Summer , At noontime and evening late , The little one 's watching for papa — Waiting to open the gate . And now the bright Summer is ended , And Autumn 's gay mantle unrolled ; The maple leaves wooing the breezes Are gorgeous in crimson and gold . At noonday the face at the gateway Is flushed with a feverish glow , At night the bright head on the pillow Is tossing in pain to and fro . The father kneels down in his anguish , And stifles the sobs with groan ; He knows that his idol is going — Going out in the midnight alone . He buries his face in the pillow , Close , close , to the fast failing breath ; A little arm clasps his neck closely , A voice growing husky in death Says pleadingly , half in a whisper : “ Please , darling papa , do n't cry ; I know Birdie 's going to Heaven — I heard doctor say he will die ; “ But I 'll ask God for one of the windows The pretty star-eyes look out through , And when you come up with the angels I 'll sure be the first to see you . “ And maybe I 'll find my dear mamma ; And you 'll come up , too , by-and-by , And Birdie will watch for you , papa , And open the gate of the sky . ” The little hand falls from his shoulder All nerveless , the blue eyes dilate , A shuddering sigh , then the baby Is waiting to open the gate . WHITE HONEYSUCKLE . White honeysuckle , “ bond of love , ” Emblem born in Orient bowers , Whence mythic Deities have wooed , And told the soul 's desire in flowers . As sweet thy breath as Eden 's balm , As sweet and pure . Methinks that erst Thy flower was of our earth a part , Some angel hand the seed immersed In fragrance of the lotus ’ heart , And dropped it from the realm of calm . And life of earth , and life above , Thou bindest with they “ bond of love . ” ESTRANGEMENT . Only a “ something light as air , ” Which never words could tell , Yet feel you that between your lives A cloud has strangely fell ; Though never a change in look or tone , A change your heart is grieving ; You sentient feel the friend you love Has deemed you are deceiving . A promise rashly given has bound Your lips the truth to screen , The nameless something gathers fast As mist the hills between ; You wrap you in your cloak of pride , The words are never spoken That might have thrown the portal wide , And friendship 's tie is broken . BRING FLOWERS . Bring flowers , bring flowers , thou Queen of the Spring , Sweet flowers to garland the earth , Exotics to bloom in the mansions of wealth , Wild flowers for the lowly hearth . Bring flowers for the brave and strong-hearted , Bring flowers for the merry and glad , Bring flowers for the weak and despairing , Bring flowers for the weary and sad . Bring flowers , bring flowers , thou Queen of the Spring , Sweet flowers , the dark hours to cheer . Bring flowers for the little ones , flowers for the aged , Bring flowers for the bridal and bier . In this beautiful , sun-lighted Springtime , Bring flowers their fragrance to shed , To brighten the homes of the living , To garnish the graves of the dead . GOOD-BYE . Good-bye ! Good-bye ! Once pledged we fondly o'er and o'er That nought should cloud our love 's bright sky ; Once thought we that we could not stay Apart and live . But oh ! For us Fate willed it not to linger thus . To-day earth 's wintry poles apart Are further not that we in heart , Nor colder than our sunless way . Passion and pride can do no more , And you and I can only say Good-bye ! Good-bye ! Good-bye ! Good-bye ! So sad it seems the sound of tears , So sad it seems life 's parting sigh , And yet , alas ! It can but be . Deserted ghostly wrecks of dreams Once freighted with Hope 's golden gleams , Wrecks drifting on a sullen sea , To mock the memory-haunted years , Are all now left to you and me . Good-bye ! Good-bye ! IN THE TWILIGHT . In the twilight gray and shadowy , Deepening o'er the sunset 's glow , Softly through the mystic dimness Flitting shadows come and go . As my thoughts in listless wandering With these phantom shadows fly , Meseems they wear the forms of faces , Faces loved in days gone by . One by one I recognize them As they silent gather near ; Some are loving , childish faces , Knowing naught of grief or care . Some are blooming , youthful faces , Victory confident to win , Some are from the contest shrinking , Wearied with the strife and din . Some are aged , wrinkled faces , Time life 's sands has nearly run ; Not a leaflet spared of Springtime , Not a furrow left undone . Other faces , sweet , sad faces , Wafted o'er the Lethean sea , Radiant smile in twilight shadows , But they came not back to me . In the twilight , dreamy twilight , When the sultry day is gone , Quietly o'er vale and hillside , Tenderly as blush of dawn , Come the timid evening breezes , Sighing through the Summer leaves , Transient as thought 's pencil-paintings , Sweet as weft that fancy weaves . And as shadows in the twilight Shapeful forms of faces wear , So these dainty , light-winged zephyrs , To my hearing , voices are . Voices whose sad intonations Seemingly , as flit they past , Bring to memory hopes long shattered , Blissful dreams too bright to last . Voices , merry laughing voices , Fondly loved in other years , Mournfully are whispering to me That their mirth was drowned in tears . Telling of a fairer fortune Far away ‘ neath tropic skies , Telling of a broken circle , Scattered friends and severed ties . Other kindly , loving voices , Winning in the long ago , Tell me now , as then they told me , “ Thou canst live for weal or woe . ” Are these weird and mystic voices But creations of the brain ? Only in illusive fancy Must I hear their tones again ? Would some magic power lend me Aid to stay the witching tone , Art to pain the beauteous picture Ere its impress swift has flown . While I dreamed the day has faded , Stars are shining overhead , Evening winds have ceased to whisper , Twilight 's shadows all have fled . Thus , too oft , our life-work seemeth , And we , when disowned its sway , Find we are pursuing phantoms , Shadows in the twilight gray . HOME . “ How many times and oft ” has the sweet , sweet word been sung in song and told in story . And he sang sweetest of home , who had never a home on earth . If one to whom home was only a poet 's dream , could portray its charms by only imagination , until a million hearts thrilled with responsive echo , how deeper , how more intense must be his longings and recollections who treasures , deep down in his heart the sweet delights and pure associations that he has known , but never may know again . We do not appreciate our blessings until they have passed . We do not try to gather the sunbeams until the clouds have obscured them . How many and many a youth , brave-hearted and true , answers with eager haste the war call of his native land all heedless of the home he is leaving , and the loving arms that sheltered him there . But when his soldier 's blood is crimsoning the sands beneath a foreign sky , the thoughts that go with his ebbing life are of home — all of home . Who rushes from his home out into the world , blind devotee of fortune 's phantom goddess , to realize a phantom indeed , sits down in his despondency and his despair , to dream of “ dear old home ” . Yes , too , and the wretch — so seemingly depraved that nothing beautiful or pure of soul is left — who flings from him his life in mad suicide , goes out into that trackless eternity with home upon the lips of death . Then if the patter of baby 's feet , the glad ring of children 's voices echo within the walls of your home , if father and mother ; and brothers and sisters brighten it with the sunshine of love , enjoy it while you may , make it your heaven , and be not in over-haste to break the ties that bind you there . You may never weep , perchance , over a home made desolate by death ; and yet , time — so surely as time is — will make it but only a memory . And all too late each heart will learn that it did not prize enough the blessedness of home .</p>

      <head>OUT IN THE COLD .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Out from a narrow , crowded street ,</l>
       <l n="2">Sick'ning resort of shame and crime ,</l>
       <l n="3">Wearing upon her brow a curse ,</l>
       <l n="4">Out in the darkness , lost to sight ,</l>
       <l n="5">Out in the dreary Winter night ,</l>
       <l n="6">Fleeing a fate than Nessus worse .</l>
       <l n="7">On through the gathering mist and dew</l>
       <l n="8">‘ Till the fog-wrapped city is hid from view ;</l>
       <l n="9">‘ Till the rugged cliffs with the waters meet ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the mingled voices from every clime</l>
       <l n="11">And the hurrying tramp of reckless feet</l>
       <l n="12">Are drowned in the breakers ’ sobbing rhyme .</l>
       <l n="13">But farther out than this ocean beach ,</l>
       <l n="14">Farther than Charity 's hands will reach ,</l>
       <l n="15">Farther than Pity dares to come ,</l>
       <l n="16">Is she who rushes , with white lips dumb ,</l>
       <l n="17">To repeat the tale that too oft is told —</l>
       <l n="18">Out in the cold .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="19">From the loathesome dens whose scenes appal ,</l>
       <l n="20">Whose tainted breath 's the Simoom 's blast ;</l>
       <l n="21">Away on the dizzying , surf-washed rock ,</l>
       <l n="22">Pausing a moment upon the brink —</l>
       <l n="23">Pausing a moment perchance to think ;</l>
       <l n="24">Sliding the bolt in Memory 's lock ,</l>
       <l n="25">And back in its dusty , haunted hall ,</l>
       <l n="26">Living again the vanished past —</l>
       <l n="27">Living her happy childhood o'er ;</l>
       <l n="28">Chasing the butterflies over the flowers ,</l>
       <l n="29">Petted and loved , a girl again ,</l>
       <l n="30">Dreaming away the golden hours ;</l>
       <l n="31">Living again another scene ,</l>
       <l n="32">Flattered and toasted “ beauty 's queen ; ”</l>
       <l n="33">Taking again , with a merry laugh ,</l>
       <l n="34">From gallant hands a sparkling draught .</l>
       <l n="35">O , angels , tell her ‘ tis a draught of woe !</l>
       <l n="36">That ruin lies in its amber glow .</l>
       <l n="37">Over the rest let oblivion fall ,</l>
       <l n="38">Cover it up with a funeral pall ;</l>
       <l n="39">Turn away with a shudder and groan ,</l>
       <l n="40">Let her live it over alone .</l>
       <l n="41">Few are the months , as they count , since then ;</l>
       <l n="42">Short and joyous they else had been</l>
       <l n="43">That to anguished heart and maddened brain</l>
       <l n="44">Are long decades of woe and pain .</l>
       <l n="45">Over , again , on the wings of thought ,</l>
       <l n="46">Treading the path which her ruin wrought ;</l>
       <l n="47">Over again each step she went ,</l>
       <l n="48">From the sunny home to the swift descent ,</l>
       <l n="49">Where sin lies hidden ‘ neath a gilded pile ,</l>
       <l n="50">Down to the haunts of the low and vile .</l>
       <l n="51">One more step and it all is done .</l>
       <l n="52">Only a shriek the midnight breaks —</l>
       <l n="53">Only a splash in the waves below ,</l>
       <l n="54">A wider ripple the water makes .</l>

     <p>A NEGLECTED “ WOMAN 'S RIGHT . ”</p>
     <p>I have listened to this cry of “ Woman 's Rights , ” this clamoring for the ballot , for redress for woman 's wrongs , and I could but think , amid it all , that there is one “ woman 's right ” — the right that could make the widest redress for woman 's wrongs — which she holds in her own hands and does not exercise . It is the right to defend , to uplift and ennoble womankind ; to be as lenient to a plea for mercy from a fallen woman as though that plea had come from the lips of a fallen man ; to throw around her also the broad mantle of charity , and if she would try to reform , give her a chance . Far be it from any honest woman to countenance the abandoned wretch who plies an unholy calling in defiance of all morality , for her very breath is contamination ; but why should you greet with smiles and warmest handclasps of friendship the man who pays his money for her blackened soul ? When two human beings ruled by the same mysterious nature , have yielded to temptations and fallen , what is this monster of social distinction that excuses the sin of one as a folly or indiscretion , while it makes that of the other a crime , which a lifetime cannot retrieve ? It is a strange justice that condones the fault of one while it condemns the other even to death ; that gives to one , when dead , funeral rite and Christian burial and to the other the Morgue and a dishonored grave , simply because one is a strong man and the other a weak woman . And it is a stranger , sadder truth that ‘ tis woman 's influence which metes out this justice to woman . Mother , if you must look with scorn and contempt upon the woman who through her love for some man has gone down to destruction , do not smilingly acknowledge her paramour a worthy suitor for your own unsullied daughter . Maiden , if you must sneeringly raise your white hand and push back into the depths of pollution the woman who seeks to reinstate herself in the path of rectitude , do not permit the man who keeps half a dozen mistresses to clasp his arm around your waist and whirl you away to the soft measure of the “ Beautiful Blue Danube . ” If the ban of society forbids that you say to a penitent sin-sick sister , “ Go and sin no more , ” if you must consign her to the life of infamy which inevitably follows the deaf ear which you turn upon her appeal , then do it ; but in God 's name do not turn around and throw open the doors of your homes and welcome to the sanctity of your family altars the man who enticed her to ruin . Ah , woman , by your tireless efforts you may win the right to vote , your voice may be heard in the Assembly Halls of the Nation ; but if you administer as one-sided a justice in political life as you do in social life , the reform for which you pray will never come !</p>

       <l n="44">To shield this back from the tempest 's roar ,</l>
       <l n="45">To spare me this — but it could not be ,</l>
       <l n="46">A tiny coffin came back to me —</l>
       <l n="47">Came back from my ship at sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="48">With reckless hand I launched again ,</l>
       <l n="49">A venture on the treacherous main ,</l>
       <l n="50">Bound for ambition 's dizzy court ;</l>
       <l n="51">Sailed from a hopeless , loveless port ;</l>
       <l n="52">With gloomy walls whose silence chilled ,</l>
       <l n="53">With ghostly haunting memories filled ,</l>
       <l n="54">With never a breath of the roses dead ;</l>
       <l n="55">Never a rest for a weary head ,</l>
       <l n="56">Never a dream of a sweet to be ,</l>
       <l n="57">Hopeless , loveless still , to me ,</l>
       <l n="58">My ship came home from sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="59">The last , and least , of all the ships</l>
       <l n="60">Fashioned with hands , and heart , and lips ,</l>
       <l n="61">I pushed from shore with its decks untrod</l>
       <l n="62">And the freight it bore was my faith in God .</l>
       <l n="63">I recked not whither its way , nor when ,</l>
       <l n="64">Nor how , if ever , ‘ twould come again ,</l>
       <l n="65">And this , alone , came back to me ,</l>
       <l n="66">Rich-laden from the stormy sea .</l>
       <l n="67">And so , sweet maiden , while your dreams</l>
       <l n="68">Paint fairest all that fairest seems ,</l>
       <l n="69">I stand with you and watch to-day</l>
       <l n="70">The ship that sails form the shore away ;</l>
       <l n="71">But never a sail from over the sea</l>
       <l n="72">The flowing tide will bring to me —</l>
       <l n="73">My ships have come from sea .</l>
