     <p>Justinian at Windermere</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">We took a hundredweight of books</l>
       <l n="2">To Windermere between us ,</l>
       <l n="3">Our dons had blessed our studious looks ,</l>
       <l n="4">Had they by chance but seen us .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Maine , Blackstone , Sandars , all were there ,</l>
       <l n="6">And Hallam 's Middle Ages ,</l>
       <l n="7">And Austin with his style so rare ,</l>
       <l n="8">And Poste 's enticing pages .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">We started well : the little inn</l>
       <l n="10">Was deadly dull and quiet ,</l>
       <l n="11">As dull as Mrs. Wood 's East Lynne ,</l>
       <l n="12">Or as the verse of Wyatt .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Without distraction thus we read</l>
       <l n="14">From nine until eleven ,</l>
       <l n="15">Then rowed and sailed until we fed</l>
       <l n="16">On potted char at seven .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Two hours of work ! We could devote</l>
       <l n="18">Next day to recreation ,</l>
       <l n="19">Much illness springs , so doctors note ,</l>
       <l n="20">From lack of relaxation .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Let him read law on summer days ,</l>
       <l n="22">Who has a soul that grovels ;</l>
       <l n="23">Better one tale of Thackeray 's</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">At noon we went upon the lake ,</l>
       <l n="26">We could not stand the slowness</l>
       <l n="27">Of our lone inn , so dined on steak</l>
       <l n="28">( They called it steak ) at Bowness .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">We wrestled with the steak , when lo !</l>
       <l n="30">Rose Jack in such a hurry ,</l>
       <l n="31">He saw a girl he used to know</l>
       <l n="32">In Suffolk or in Surrey .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">What matter which ? to think that she</l>
       <l n="34">Should lure him from his duty !</l>
       <l n="35">For Jack , I knew , would always be</l>
       <l n="36">A very slave to beauty .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">And so it proved , alas ! for Jack</l>
       <l n="38">Grew taciturn and thinner ,</l>
       <l n="39">Was out all day alone , and back</l>
       <l n="40">Too often late for dinner .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">What could I do ? His walks and rows</l>
       <l n="42">All led to one conclusion ;</l>
       <l n="43">I could not read ; our work , heaven knows ,</l>
       <l n="44">Was nothing but confusion .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">Like Jack I went about alone ,</l>
       <l n="46">Saw Wordsworth 's writing-table ,</l>
       <l n="47">And made the higher by a stone</l>
       <l n="48">The “ man ” upon Great Gable .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="49">At last there came a sudden pause</l>
       <l n="50">To all his wanderings solus ,</l>

       <l n="52">Of Rome had meant by dolus .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="53">The Suffolk ( was it Surrey ? ) flirt</l>
       <l n="54">Without a pang threw over</l>
       <l n="55">Poor Jack and all his works like dirt ,</l>
       <l n="56">And caught a richer lover .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="57">We read one morning more to say</l>
       <l n="58">We had not been quite idle ,</l>
       <l n="59">And then to end the arduous day</l>
       <l n="60">Enjoyed a swim in Rydal .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="61">Next day the hundredweight of books</l>
       <l n="62">Was packed once more in cases ,</l>
       <l n="63">We left the lakes and hills and brooks</l>
       <l n="64">And southward turned our faces .</l>

       <l n="65">Three months , and then the Oxford Schools ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="69">Curst questions ! Jack did only one ,</l>

     <p>[ B ] Aulus Agerius and Numerius Negidius are names continually occurring in the Roman institutional writers as typical names of parties to legal process , corresponding very much to the John Stiles and John Nokes of the older English law-books , and the Amr and Zaid of Mohammedan law . John Stiles was frequently contracted to J. S .</p>
     <p>[ C ] Vi and clam were part of the form of the interdict , which was a mode of procedure by which the prætor settled the right of possession of landed property .</p>
     <p>[ D ] The casual ejector was John Doe , who was , like Richard Roe , an entirely imaginary person , of much importance in the old action of ejectment abolished in 1852 .</p>
     <p>[ E ] The allusion is to the “ Advocates ’ Widows Fund , ” subscribed to by all members of the Scottish bar , married or unmarried . The non-existent widow of the unmarried advocate has been a frequent subject of legal verse . See “ The Bachelor 's Dream , ” by John Rankine , ( Journal of Jurisprudence , vol . xxii . p. 155 ) , “ My Widow , ” by David Crichton ( id . vol . xxiv . p. 51 ) .</p>

     </lg>
     <note>The plaintiff was committed to the Fleet Prison on Feb. 8 , 1596 , by order of the Lord Keeper , for drawing a replication of sixscore sheets containing much impertinent matter which might well have been contained in sixteen . On Feb. 10 the Lord Keeper ordered that on the following Saturday the Warden of the Fleet should cut a hole through the replication , and put the plaintiff 's head through the hole and let it hang about his shoulders with the written side outwards , and lead the plaintiff bareheaded and barefaced round about Westminster Hall , and show him at the bar of all the courts , and so back to the Fleet .— Abridged from Spence 's Equitable Jurisdiction , vol . i. p. 376 .</note>

       <l n="3">Aid me , Muses ! my endeavour is to sing a woful song ,</l>
       <l n="4">How a very learned bishop in the Arches Court went wrong .</l>
       <l n="5">Aid me , for duplex querela is an uninviting theme ,</l>
       <l n="6">And the practice of the Arches raises no poetic dream .</l>
       <l n="7">‘ Tis the Reverend Child Willis , child in name but not in age ,</l>
       <l n="8">Comes he to the Court of Arches burning with a noble rage ,</l>
       <l n="9">Filing his duplex querela , claiming for himself thereby</l>
       <l n="10">Vicarage of Drayton Parslow , or to know the reason why .</l>
       <l n="11">“ Reason why ? ” the bishop answers ; “ that is not so far to seek .</l>
       <l n="12">Little Latin have you , Willis , innocent are you of Greek .</l>
       <l n="13">You were specially examined by my good Archdeacon Pott ;</l>
       <l n="14">He reported to me promptly , ‘ Greek and Latin all forgot ,</l>
       <l n="15">Non idoneus is Willis , minus et sufficiens ,</l>
       <l n="16">He may have a sanum corpus , but he lacks a sana mens . ’ ”</l>
       <l n="17">“ Nay , ” says Willis , “ such an answer is but trifling with the court ,</l>
       <l n="18">I have preached a Latin sermon , and the classics are my forte ,</l>
       <l n="19">You must name the books I failed in , you must give me every chance</l>
       <l n="20">Of a fresh examination at the hands of Lord Penzance . ”</l>
       <l n="21">Lord Penzance supported Willis : “ Bishop , you must file , ” said he ,</l>
       <l n="22">“ Some more tangible objection , some less vague and general plea .</l>
       <l n="23">As it stands I cannot gather what it is you ploughed him in ,</l>
       <l n="24">Whether Hellenistic aorists or the Latin word for sin . ”</l>
       <l n="25">But alas ! the world has never known as yet what Willis did ,</l>
       <l n="26">In the breast of the Archdeacon still it lies a secret hid .</l>
       <l n="27">Was his Latin prose defective ? Did his style of writing show</l>
       <l n="28">More resemblance to Tertullian than to Tullius Cicero ?</l>
       <l n="29">Were his dates a little shaky ? Could it , could it be that he</l>
       <l n="30">Confidently made Augustine flourish at a date B. C . ?</l>
       <l n="31">None will know save Pott , Archdeacon , for alas ! the patroness</l>
       <l n="32">Showed no mercy to Child Willis in the day of his distress .</l>
       <l n="33">She revoked the presentation , leaving Willis in the lurch ,</l>
       <l n="34">One of undisputed learning preached in Drayton Parslow church .</l>
       <l n="35">Doubly barren was his triumph , it was not a twelve-month ere</l>
       <l n="36">Death set up his Court of Arches , Willis did not triumph there .</l>

       <l n="3">Captain Dashwood , who had been</l>
       <l n="4">In the service of the Queen ,</l>
       <l n="5">Sick of “ Eyes front ” and “ Attention , ”</l>
       <l n="6">Came to London on his pension .</l>
       <l n="7">At the “ Portland ” as he stayed ,</l>
       <l n="8">Firm the friendship that he made</l>
       <l n="9">With one William Richards , who</l>
       <l n="10">Put up at the “ Portland ” too .</l>
       <l n="11">Passed six years , then he was wrapped in</l>
       <l n="12">Love 's embraces , vanquished captain !</l>
       <l n="13">“ Yes , ” he cried , “ I will ; no bar shall</l>
       <l n="14">Stop my wedding Edith Marshall . ”</l>
       <l n="15">But there was a bar , ‘ twas that</l>
       <l n="16">He was poorer than a rat ;</l>
       <l n="17">Indian pensions do not run</l>
       <l n="18">More than just enough for one .</l>
       <l n="19">Edith , too , had not a cent ,</l>
       <l n="20">Who would pay the rates and rent ?</l>
       <l n="21">Two more years , and Richards moved</l>
       <l n="22">( He perchance had sometime loved ) ,</l>
       <l n="23">Promised them an income clear ,</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Twas five hundred pounds a year</l>
       <l n="25">For his life ; when he was dead ,</l>
       <l n="26">Then ten thousand pounds instead .</l>
       <l n="27">This to Dashwood in a letter</l>
       <l n="28">Wrote he , deeming it was better</l>
       <l n="29">They should marry soon while he</l>
       <l n="30">Lived their happiness to see .</l>
       <l n="31">‘ Twas a modest sum , but marriage</l>
       <l n="32">May be blest without a carriage ,</l>
       <l n="33">Forty pounds a month and more</l>
       <l n="34">Keep the wolf from near the door .</l>
       <l n="35">So they wed for worse or better ,</l>
       <l n="36">On the faith of Richards ’ letter .</l>
       <l n="37">Scarcely was a quarter 's payment</l>
       <l n="38">Due when mourning was their raiment .</l>
       <l n="39">Richards died . Alas ! no cash would</l>
       <l n="40">Find its way to Captain Dashwood .</l>
       <l n="41">Dashwood 's head began to swim —</l>
       <l n="42">Not a shilling left to him !</l>
       <l n="43">“ Ha , I 'll have it still , ” cried he ;</l>
       <l n="44">“ Justice dwells in Chancery . ”</l>
       <l n="45">So the case was straightway taken</l>
       <l n="46">To the court of V. - C. Bacon .</l>
       <l n="47">Vainly Dashwood cash expended</l>
       <l n="48">The executors defended ,</l>
       <l n="49">Claiming that what Richards wrote</l>
       <l n="50">Was not worth a five-pound note ;</l>
       <l n="51">First because the dead testator</l>
       <l n="52">Well , not wisely , loved the “ cratur , ”</l>
       <l n="53">More than that , had often been</l>
       <l n="54">In delirium tremens seen ;</l>
       <l n="55">Secondly , because he signed</l>
       <l n="56">When he did not know his mind ;</l>
       <l n="57">Third , because pollicitation</l>
       <l n="58">Is not good consideration .</l>
       <l n="59">Law , of justice independent ,</l>
       <l n="60">Gave its judgment for defendant .</l>
       <l n="61">Poorer than he was at first ,</l>
       <l n="62">That unhappy plaintiff cursed ,</l>
       <l n="63">With a special satisfaction</l>
       <l n="64">Cursed the day he brought his action .</l>
       <l n="65">Would that he 'd in India tarried !</l>

       <l n="68">Pauper to a pauper wife ,</l>

       <l n="2">Kind reader , tarry here , nor miss</l>
       <l n="3">The law of Minneapolis .</l>
       <l n="4">There was a carpenter called Brown ,</l>
       <l n="5">A citizen of that great town ,</l>
       <l n="6">Who stood his “ inexpressive she ”</l>
       <l n="7">A dollar 's worth of comedy .</l>
       <l n="8">Was it a Gaiety burlesque ,</l>
       <l n="9">Or labour of Norwegian desk ?</l>
       <l n="10">Or did they spout in stagey tones</l>
       <l n="11">Morality by H. A. Jones ?</l>
       <l n="12">Or tear romance to rags and set it</l>
       <l n="13">In heavy platitudes by Pettit ?</l>

       <l n="15">The subject I have clean forgot .</l>
       <l n="16">Sufficient that the pair did sit</l>
       <l n="17">In expectation in the pit ,</l>
       <l n="18">An expectation not fulfilled ,</l>
       <l n="19">‘ Twas otherwise by fortune willed .</l>
       <l n="20">Before this loving couple sat</l>
       <l n="21">In solitary state a hat —</l>
       <l n="22">A hat , I say , for in their wonder</l>
       <l n="23">They never noticed what was under ,</l>
       <l n="24">The wearer must have been a “ human , ”</l>
       <l n="25">But might have been a man or woman .</l>
       <l n="26">‘ Twas like a mountain crowned with trees</l>
       <l n="27">Amid the pathless Pyrenees ,</l>
       <l n="28">Or like a garden planned by Paxton ,</l>
       <l n="29">Or colophon designed by Caxton ,</l>
       <l n="30">So intricate the work ; and flowers</l>
       <l n="31">Were trained to climb its soaring towers ,</l>
       <l n="32">Convolvulus and candytuft ,</l>
       <l n="33">And ‘ mid them water-wagtails stuffed .</l>
       <l n="34">Such splendour never yet , I wis ,</l>
       <l n="35">Had shone in Minneapolis .</l>
       <l n="36">But Brown was in a sore dilemma ,</l>
       <l n="37">A dollar he had paid for Emma</l>
       <l n="38">To see a play , and not a hat ;</l>
       <l n="39">A dollar , it was dear at that .</l>
       <l n="40">And Emma — disappointment racked her ,</l>
       <l n="41">She never saw a single actor .</l>
       <l n="42">So Brown , with visage thunder-black ,</l>
       <l n="43">Demanded both his dollars back .</l>
       <l n="44">The man who took the cash said , “ Sonny ,</l>
       <l n="45">Our rule is not to give back money .</l>
       <l n="46">But if you 'll come another night ,</l>
       <l n="47">Maybe you 'll get a better sight . ”</l>
       <l n="48">So Brown went home and nursed his sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="49">His writ he issued on the morrow .</l>
       <l n="50">A hundred dollars was his claim ,</l>
       <l n="51">And the young lady claimed the same .</l>
       <l n="52">The case was argued , on revision</l>
       <l n="53">Of pleadings , this was the decision :</l>
       <l n="54">“ The theatre 's defence is bad ,</l>
       <l n="55">Brown paid for what he never had ,</l>
       <l n="56">He paid when in the pit he sat</l>
       <l n="57">To see a play and not a hat .</l>
       <l n="58">To bring defendants to their senses ,</l>
       <l n="59">I find for plaintiffs with expenses . ”</l>

     <note>On a complaint for keeping open a tobacconist 's shop on Sunday , contrary to the law of Massachusetts , it was held that the court will take judicial notice that tobacco and cigars are not drugs and medicines , and will exclude the testimony of a witness who offers evidence that they are .</note>

       <l n="1">Against the statutes of the Old Bay State</l>
       <l n="2">Marzynski on a Sunday stood behind</l>
       <l n="3">His counter , well content his gain to find</l>
       <l n="4">In pipes not pills , cigars not carbonate .</l>
       <l n="5">From breakfast till ‘ twas dusk at half-past eight</l>
       <l n="6">Tobacco cheered this hardened sinner 's mind ,</l>
       <l n="7">The price of it his pockets , disinclined</l>
       <l n="8">To add their dime to the collection plate .</l>
       <l n="9">The State Attorney claimed the penalty ;</l>
       <l n="10">“ Cigars are no cigars , ” said the defence ,</l>
       <l n="11">“ But drugs , and we have witnesses to prove it . ”</l>
       <l n="12">“ Cigars to be cigars judicially</l>
       <l n="13">We notice , and reject the evidence . ”</l>
       <l n="14">So said the Court , and spat , and nought could move it .</l>

    <p n="7">“ Lend me sestertia , Caius , only twenty , ‘ Tis no great thing for you who roll in plenty . ” He was an old companion , and his coffers Were full enough to stand such friendly offers . “ Go , plead in court , ” said he ; “ ‘ tis pleadings pay us . ” “ I want your money , not your counsel , Caius . ”</p>

    <p n="13">No claim for trespass do I bring , Or homicide , or poisoning . I claim that by my neighbour 's theft Of she-goats three I was bereft . The judge of course wants evidence , But you go wandering far from thence , And with a mighty voice declaim Of Mithridates and the shame Of Cannæ , and the lies of old That Punic politicians told . And why should you pass Sylla by , The Marii and Mucii ? When , Postumus , d'ye hope to reach My stolen she-goats in your speech ?</p>

    <p n="19">A thousand doubts and pleadings in a day Are filed in Empress Reason 's court supreme By angry Love — his eyes with anger gleam . “ Which of us twain hath been more faithful , say . ‘ Tis all through me that Cino can display The sail of fame on life 's unhappy stream . ” “ Thee , ” quoth I , “ root of all my woe I deem , I found what gall beneath thy sweetness lay . ” Then he : “ Ah , traitorous and truant slave ! Are these the thanks thou renderest , ingrate , For giving thee a maid without a peer ? ” “ Thy left , ” cried I , “ slew what thy right hand gave . ” “ Not so , ” said he . The judge , “ Your wrath abate . I must have time to give true judgment here . ”</p>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO ROME Tell me , proud Rome , why dost these edicts read , These many laws by prince or people made , Or answers by the prudent duly weighed , When now thou canst the world no longer lead ? Thou readest , sad one , of each ancient deed Where thy unconquered sons their might displayed , Afric and Egypt at thy feet were laid , But slavery , not rule , is now thy meed . What boots it that thou wast of old a queen , And over foreign nations heldest rein , If thou and all thy fame no more exist ? Forgive me , God , if all my days have been Devoted to man 's laws , unjust and vain Unless Thy law within the heart be fixed . Cino da Pistoia . JUSTICE Ah ! justice is a virtue bepraised and full of worth , It castigates the sinner , and peoples all the earth , And kings with care should guard it — instead they now forget The gem that is most precious in all the coronet . Some think they may do justice by cruelty , I wist ; But ‘ tis an evil counsel , for justice must consist In showing deeds of mercy , in knowledge of the truth , And executing judgment it executes with ruth . Pedro Lopez de Ayala . THE POET AND THE ADVOCATE Glory and gain thus mixed distract the thought , We owe to honour all , to fortune nought ; The poet , like the soldier , scorns for pay Peruvian gold , but seeks the wreath of bay . How is the advocate the poet 's peer ? The poet 's glory is complete and clear ; He far outlives the advocate 's renown , Patru is e'en by Scarron 's name weighed down . The bar of Greece and Rome you point me out , A bar that trained great men , I do not doubt , For then chicane with language void of sense Had not deformed the law and eloquence . Purge the tribune of all this monstrous growth , I mount it , and my soul will sink , though loth , Will yield to fortune and will speak in prose . But since reform in this so slowly grows , Leave me my tastes , for I aspire to be By verse ennobled to posterity , To hold first place in arts above the law , More grave and noble than it ever saw . Fraud in this age of ours unpunished can Tread down the equity so dear to man . Can you for spirits just and generous find A fairer cause to plead before mankind ? Mother or stepmother let Fortune be , The theatre and not the bar for me ; For client virtue , truth for counsel 's wage ; For judge the present and the coming age . Piron , La Métromanie , Act iii . Sc . 7 . MORRISON AND GIBB , PRINTERS , EDINBURGH .</p>
