  <body>
   <p>It is not so easy to write ballads descriptive of the bushland of Australia as on light consideration would appear . Reasonably good verse on the subject has been supplied in sufficient quantity . But the maker of folksongs for our newborn nation requires a somewhat rare combination of gifts and experiences . Dowered with the poet 's heart , he must yet have passed his ‘ wander-jaehre ’ amid the stern solitude of the Austral waste — must have ridden the race in the back-block township , guided the reckless stock-horse adown the mountain spur , and followed the night-long moving , spectral-seeming herd ‘ in the droving days ’ . Amid such scarce congenial surroundings comes oft that finer sense which renders visible bright gleams of humour , pathos , and romance , which , like undiscovered gold , await the fortunate adventurer . That the author has touched this treasure-trove , not less delicately than distinctly , no true Australian will deny . In my opinion this collection comprises the best bush ballads written since the death of Lindsay Gordon .</p>
   <p>Rolf Boldrewood</p>
   <p>A number of these verses are now published for the first time , most of the others were written for and appeared in “ The Bulletin ” ( Sydney , N. S. W . ) , and are therefore already widely known to readers in Australasia .</p>

     <l n="53">The Man from Snowy River</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="54">There was movement at the station , for the word had passed around</l>
     <l n="55">That the colt from old Regret had got away ,</l>
     <l n="56">And had joined the wild bush horses — he was worth a thousand pound ,</l>
     <l n="57">So all the cracks had gathered to the fray .</l>
     <l n="58">All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far</l>
     <l n="59">Had mustered at the homestead overnight ,</l>
     <l n="60">For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are ,</l>
     <l n="61">And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="62">There was Harrison , who made his pile when Pardon won the cup ,</l>
     <l n="63">The old man with his hair as white as snow ;</l>
     <l n="64">But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up —</l>
     <l n="65">He would go wherever horse and man could go .</l>
     <l n="66">And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand ,</l>
     <l n="67">No better horseman ever held the reins ;</l>
     <l n="68">For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand ,</l>
     <l n="69">He learnt to ride while droving on the plains .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="70">And one was there , a stripling on a small and weedy beast ,</l>
     <l n="71">He was something like a racehorse undersized ,</l>
     <l n="72">With a touch of Timor pony — three parts thoroughbred at least —</l>
     <l n="73">And such as are by mountain horsemen prized .</l>
     <l n="74">He was hard and tough and wiry — just the sort that wo n't say die —</l>
     <l n="75">There was courage in his quick impatient tread ;</l>
     <l n="76">And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye ,</l>
     <l n="77">And the proud and lofty carriage of his head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="78">But still so slight and weedy , one would doubt his power to stay ,</l>
     <l n="79">And the old man said , ‘ That horse will never do</l>
     <l n="80">For a long and tiring gallop — lad , you 'd better stop away ,</l>
     <l n="81">Those hills are far too rough for such as you . ’</l>
     <l n="82">So he waited sad and wistful — only Clancy stood his friend —</l>
     <l n="83">‘ I think we ought to let him come , ’ he said ;</l>
     <l n="84">‘ I warrant he 'll be with us when he 's wanted at the end ,</l>
     <l n="85">For both his horse and he are mountain bred .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="86">‘ He hails from Snowy River , up by Kosciusko 's side ,</l>
     <l n="87">Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough ,</l>
     <l n="88">Where a horse 's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride ,</l>
     <l n="89">The man that holds his own is good enough .</l>
     <l n="90">And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home ,</l>
     <l n="91">Where the river runs those giant hills between ;</l>
     <l n="92">I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam ,</l>
     <l n="93">But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="94">So he went — they found the horses by the big mimosa clump —</l>
     <l n="95">They raced away towards the mountain 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="96">And the old man gave his orders , ‘ Boys , go at them from the jump ,</l>
     <l n="97">No use to try for fancy riding now .</l>
     <l n="98">And , Clancy , you must wheel them , try and wheel them to the right .</l>
     <l n="99">Ride boldly , lad , and never fear the spills ,</l>
     <l n="100">For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight ,</l>
     <l n="101">If once they gain the shelter of those hills . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="102">So Clancy rode to wheel them — he was racing on the wing</l>
     <l n="103">Where the best and boldest riders take their place ,</l>
     <l n="104">And he raced his stock-horse past them , and he made the ranges ring</l>
     <l n="105">With the stockwhip , as he met them face to face .</l>
     <l n="106">Then they halted for a moment , while he swung the dreaded lash ,</l>
     <l n="107">But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view ,</l>
     <l n="108">And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash ,</l>
     <l n="109">And off into the mountain scrub they flew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="110">Then fast the horsemen followed , where the gorges deep and black</l>
     <l n="111">Resounded to the thunder of their tread ,</l>
     <l n="112">And the stockwhips woke the echoes , and they fiercely answered back</l>
     <l n="113">From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead .</l>
     <l n="114">And upward , ever upward , the wild horses held their way ,</l>
     <l n="115">Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide ;</l>
     <l n="116">And the old man muttered fiercely , ‘ We may bid the mob good day ,</l>
     <l n="117">NO man can hold them down the other side . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="118">When they reached the mountain 's summit , even Clancy took a pull ,</l>
     <l n="119">It well might make the boldest hold their breath ,</l>
     <l n="120">The wild hop scrub grew thickly , and the hidden ground was full</l>
     <l n="121">Of wombat holes , and any slip was death .</l>
     <l n="122">But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head ,</l>
     <l n="123">And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer ,</l>
     <l n="124">And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed ,</l>
     <l n="125">While the others stood and watched in very fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="126">He sent the flint stones flying , but the pony kept his feet ,</l>
     <l n="127">He cleared the fallen timber in his stride ,</l>
     <l n="128">And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat —</l>
     <l n="129">It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride .</l>
     <l n="130">Through the stringy barks and saplings , on the rough and broken ground ,</l>
     <l n="131">Down the hillside at a racing pace he went ;</l>
     <l n="132">And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound ,</l>
     <l n="133">At the bottom of that terrible descent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="134">He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill ,</l>
     <l n="135">And the watchers on the mountain standing mute ,</l>
     <l n="136">Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely , he was right among them still ,</l>
     <l n="137">As he raced across the clearing in pursuit .</l>
     <l n="138">Then they lost him for a moment , where two mountain gullies met</l>
     <l n="139">In the ranges , but a final glimpse reveals</l>
     <l n="140">On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet ,</l>
     <l n="141">With the man from Snowy River at their heels .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="142">And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam .</l>

    <p>THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER , AND OTHER VERSES .</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="184">By A . B. Paterson .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>THE LITERARY YEAR BOOK : “ The immediate success of this book of bush ballads is without parallel in Colonial literary annals , nor can any living English or American poet boast so wide a public , always excepting Mr. Rudyard Kipling . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">SPECTATOR : “ These lines have the true lyrical cry in them .</l>
     <l n="2">Eloquent and ardent verses . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ATHENAEUM : “ Swinging , rattling ballads of ready humour , ready pathos , and crowding adventure . ... Stirring and entertaining ballads about great rides , in which the lines gallop like the very hoofs of the horses . ”</p>
   <p>THE TIMES : “ At his best he compares not unfavourably with the author of ‘ Barrack-Room Ballads ’ . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Patchett Martin , in LITERATURE ( London ): “ In my opinion , it is the absolutely un-English , thoroughly Australian style and character of these new bush bards which has given them such immediate popularity , such wide vogue , among all classes of the rising native generation . ”</p>
   <p>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE : “ Australia has produced in Mr. A . B. Paterson a national poet whose bush ballads are as distinctly characteristic of the country as Burns 's poetry is characteristic of Scotland . ”</p>
   <p>THE SCOTSMAN : “ A book like this ... is worth a dozen of the aspiring , idealistic sort , since it has a deal of rough laughter and a dash of real tears in its composition . ”</p>
   <p>GLASGOW HERALD : “ These ballads ... are full of such go that the mere reading of them make the blood tingle .... But there are other things in Mr. Paterson 's book besides mere racing and chasing , and each piece bears the mark of special local knowledge , feeling , and colour . The poet has also a note of pathos , which is always wholesome . ”</p>
   <p>LITERARY WORLD : “ He gallops along with a by no means doubtful music , shouting his vigorous songs as he rides in pursuit of wild bush horses , constraining us to listen and applaud by dint of his manly tones and capital subjects ... We turn to Mr. Paterson 's roaring muse with instantaneous gratitude . ”</p>
