    <docTitle><titlePart>Emile Verhaeren , remarkable among of the brilliant group of writers representing “ Young Belgium , ” and one who has been recognized by the literary world of France as holding a foremost place among the lyric poets of the day was born at St. Amand , near Antwerp , in 1855 . His childhood was passed on the banks of the Scheldt , in the midst of the wide-spreading Flemish plains , a country of mist and flood , of dykes and marshes , and the impressions he received from the mysterious , melancholy character of these surroundings , have produced a marked and lasting influence upon his work . Yet the other characteristics with which it is stamped — the wealth of imagination , the gloomy force , the wonderful descriptive power and sense of colour , which set the landscape before one as a picture , suggest rather the possibility of Spanish blood in the poet 's veins — and again , his somewhat morbid subjectivity and tendency to self-analysis mark him as the child of the latter end of our nineteenth century .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Verhaeren entered early in life upon the literary career . After some time spent at a college in Ghent , he became a student at the University of Louvain , and here he founded and edited a journal called “ La Semaine , ” in which work he was assisted by the singer Van Dyck , and by his friend and present publisher , Edmond Deman . He also formed , about this time , a close friendship with Maeterlinck . In<date>1881</date>, Verhaeren was called to the Bar at Brussels , but soon gave up his legal career to devote himself entirely to literature . In<date>1883</date>he published his first volume of poems , and shortly afterwards became one of the editors of “ L'Art Moderne , ” to which , as well as to other contemporary periodicals , he was for many years a contributor . In<date>1892</date>he founded , with the help of two other friends , the “ Section of Art ” in the “ House of the People , ” a popular institution in Brussels , where performances of the best music , as well as lectures upon literary and artistic subjects , were given . In spite , however , of the work which all this entailed , and of the many interests created by his ardent appreciation of the various branches of art and literature , Verhaeren continued to labour unceasingly at his poetical work , and between<date>1883</date>and<date>1897</date>brought out successively eleven small volumes : Les Flamandes , Les Moines , Les Soirs , Les Debacles , Les Flambeaux Noirs , Les Apparus dans mes chemins , Les Campagnes Hallucinees , Les Villages Illusoires , Les Villes Tentaculaires , Les Heures Claires , and Les Aubes . Throughout this entire series the intellectual and spiritual development of the poet may be closely traced — from the materialism which pervades Les Flamandes , and the despairing pessimism and lurid emotion — the throes of a self-centred soul in revolt against fate — which are so powerfully portrayed in Les Debacles and Les Flambeaux Noirs , and are apparent even in the opening pages of Les Apparus dans mes chemins — to the tender , hopeful mysticism which marks the latter poems in that volume , and the wonderful sympathy with Nature , even in her saddest aspects — the subtle power of endowing those aspects with a profound and ennobling symbolism , which characterise the most beautiful of the poems in Les Villages Illusoires . Les Heures Claires is the name given to a volume of love-songs , an exquisite record of golden hours spent in a garden at spring-time — spring-time in a double sense . The task of making an adequate and typical selection from a poet 's work is always difficult , and in this case it has been decided to limit the field of selection , at least for the present , to the three last-named volumes , which embody what may , I think , be considered as Verhaeren 's highest achievement in the realm of lyrical poetry . In style , Verhaeren is essentially the apostle of the “ Vers libre ” ; and his handling of rhyme and rhythm , his coining of words where he finds the French vocabulary insufficient , have called down upon him some criticism from those of his French contemporaries who are sticklers for the older rules and more conventional forms of versification . But however this may be , it remains an undeniable fact that Verhaeren has at his command a rare and powerful poetic eloquence — a wealth of imagery , a depth of thought and a subtlety of expression which perhaps are not to be imprisoned behind the bars of a too rigid convention . English readers have already been accustomed by their own poets to the “ vers libre , ” and it is not so much , therefore , for my adherence to this form , as for my failure adequately to render Verhaeren 's peculiar and striking beauty of language , that I beg their indulgence for the following translations .

       <l n="3">Athwart the dull grey day ,</l>
       <l n="4">Rakes the green window-pane —</l>
       <l n="5">So infinitely , endlessly , the rain ,</l>
       <l n="6">The long , long rain .</l>

       <l n="8">Since yesternight it keeps unravelling</l>
       <l n="9">Down from the frayed and flaccid rags that cling</l>
       <l n="10">About the sullen sky .</l>
       <l n="11">The low black sky ;</l>
       <l n="12">Since yesternight , so slowly , patiently .</l>
       <l n="13">Unravelling its threads upon the roads .</l>
       <l n="14">Upon the roads and lanes , with even fall</l>
       <l n="15">Continual .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="16">Along the miles</l>
       <l n="17">That ‘ twixt the meadows and the suburbs lie ,</l>
       <l n="18">By roads interminably bent , the files</l>
       <l n="19">Of waggons , with their awnings arched and tall .</l>
       <l n="20">Struggling in sweat and steam , toil slowly by</l>
       <l n="21">With outline vague as of a funeral .</l>
       <l n="22">Into the ruts , unbroken , regular ,</l>
       <l n="23">Stretching out parallel so far</l>
       <l n="24">That when night comes they seem to join the sky .</l>
       <l n="25">For hours the water drips ;</l>
       <l n="26">And every tree and every dwelling weeps .</l>
       <l n="27">Drenched as they are with it .</l>
       <l n="28">With the long rain , tenaciously , with rain</l>
       <l n="29">Indefinite .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="30">The rivers , through each rotten dyke that yields .</l>
       <l n="31">Discharge their swollen wave upon the fields .</l>
       <l n="32">Where coils of drowned hay</l>
       <l n="33">Float far away ;</l>
       <l n="34">And the wild breeze</l>
       <l n="35">Buffets the alders and the walnut-trees ;</l>
       <l n="36">Knee-deep in water great black oxen stand ,</l>
       <l n="37">Lifting their bellowings sinister on high</l>
       <l n="38">To the distorted sky ;</l>
       <l n="39">As now the night creeps onward , all the land ,</l>
       <l n="40">Thicket and plain ,</l>
       <l n="41">Grows cumbered with her clinging shades immense .</l>
       <l n="42">And still there is the rain ,</l>
       <l n="43">The long , long rain .</l>
       <l n="44">Like soot , so fine and dense .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="45">The long , long rain .</l>
       <l n="46">Rain — and its threads identical ,</l>
       <l n="47">And its nails systematical ,</l>
       <l n="48">Weaving the garment , mesh by mesh amain ,</l>
       <l n="49">Of destitution for each house and wall ,</l>
       <l n="50">And fences that enfold</l>
       <l n="51">The villages , neglected , grey , and old :</l>
       <l n="52">Chaplets of rags and linen shreds that fall</l>
       <l n="53">In frayed-out wisps from upright poles and tall .</l>
       <l n="54">Blue pigeon-houses glued against the thatch ,</l>
       <l n="55">And windows with a patch</l>
       <l n="56">Of dingy paper on each lowering pane ,</l>
       <l n="57">Houses with straight-set gutters , side by side</l>
       <l n="58">Across the broad stone gambles crucified ,</l>
       <l n="59">Mills , uniform , forlorn .</l>
       <l n="60">Each rising from its hillock like a horn ,</l>
       <l n="61">Steeples afar and chapels round about ,</l>
       <l n="62">The rain , the long , long rain ,</l>

       <l n="64">Rain , with its many wrinkles , the long rain</l>
       <l n="65">With its grey nails , and with its watery mane ;</l>
       <l n="66">The long rain of these lands of long ago ,</l>
       <l n="67">The rain , eternal in its torpid flow !</l>

      <head>THE FERRYMAN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The ferryman , a green reed ‘ twixt his teeth ,</l>
       <l n="2">With hand on oar , against the current strong</l>
       <l n="3">Had rowed and rowed so long .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">But she , alas ! whose voice was hailing him</l>
       <l n="5">Across the far waves dim .</l>
       <l n="6">Still further o'er the far waves seemed to float ,</l>
       <l n="7">Still further backwards , ‘ mid the mists , remote .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">The casements with their eyes .</l>
       <l n="9">The dial-faces of the towers that rise</l>
       <l n="10">Upon the shore ,</l>
       <l n="11">Watched , as he strove and laboured more and more .</l>
       <l n="12">With frantic bending of the back in two ,</l>
       <l n="13">And start of savage muscles strained anew .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">One oar was suddenly riven ,</l>
       <l n="15">And by the current driven ,</l>
       <l n="16">With lash of heavy breakers , out to sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">But she , whose voice that hailed him he could hear</l>
       <l n="18">There ‘ mid the mist and wind , she seemed to wring</l>
       <l n="19">Her hands with gestures yet more maddening</l>
       <l n="20">Toward him who drew not near .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">The ferryman with his surviving oar</l>
       <l n="22">Fell harder yet to work , and more and more</l>
       <l n="23">He strove , till every joint did crack and start ,</l>
       <l n="24">And fevered terror shook his very heart .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">The rudder broke</l>
       <l n="26">Beneath one sharp , rude stroke ;</l>
       <l n="27">That , too , the current drove relentlessly ,</l>
       <l n="28">A dreary shred of wreckage , out to sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">The casements by the pier ,</l>
       <l n="30">Like eyes immense and feverish open wide ,</l>
       <l n="31">The dials of the towers — those widows drear</l>
       <l n="32">Upstanding straight from mile to mile beside</l>
       <l n="33">The banks of rivers — obstinately gaze</l>
       <l n="34">Upon this madman , in his headstrong craze</l>
       <l n="35">Prolonging his mad voyage ‘ gainst the tide .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="36">But she , who yonder in the mist-clouds hailed</l>
       <l n="37">Him still so desperately , she wailed and wailed ,</l>
       <l n="38">With head outstretched in fearful , straining haste</l>
       <l n="39">Toward the unknown of the outstretched waste .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="40">Steady as one that had in bronze been cast ,</l>
       <l n="41">Amid the blenched , grey tempest and the blast .</l>
       <l n="42">The ferryman his single oar yet plied .</l>
       <l n="43">And , spite of all , still lashed and bit the tide .</l>
       <l n="44">His old eyes , with hallucinated gaze ,</l>
       <l n="45">Saw that far distance — an illumined haze —</l>
       <l n="46">Whence the voice sounded , coming toward him still .</l>
       <l n="47">Beneath the cold skies , lamentable , shrill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="48">The last oar broke —</l>
       <l n="49">And this the current hurried at one stroke ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="51">The ferryman , with arms dropped helplessly</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="54">Drifting , his barque struck somewhere , as by chance ,</l>
       <l n="55">He turned a glance</l>
       <l n="56">Towards the bank behind him then — and saw</l>
       <l n="57">He had not left the shore .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="58">The casements and the dials , one by one .</l>
       <l n="59">Their huge eyes gazing in a foolish stare .</l>
       <l n="60">Witnessed the ruin of his ardour there ;</l>
       <l n="61">But still the old , tenacious ferryman</l>
       <l n="62">Firm in his teeth — for God knows when , indeed —</l>
       <l n="63">Held the green reed .</l>
