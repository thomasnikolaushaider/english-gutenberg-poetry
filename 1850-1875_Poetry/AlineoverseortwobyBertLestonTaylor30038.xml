    <head>NOTE</head>
    <head>For the privilege of reprinting the rimes gathered here I am indebted to the courtesy of the Chicago Tribune and Puck , in whose pages most of them first appeared . “ The Lay of St. Ambrose ” is new .</head>
    <head>One reason for rounding up this fugitive verse and prisoning it between covers was this : Frequently — more or less — I receive a request for a copy of this jingle or that , and it is easier to mention a publishing house than to search through ancient and dusty files .</head>
     <l n="1">The other reason was that I wanted to .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>B. L. T .</p>
   <p>TO MY READERS</p>
   <p>Not merely of this book ,— but a larger company , with whom , through the medium of the Chicago Tribune , I have been on very pleasant terms for several years ,— this handful of rime is joyously dedicated .</p>
   <p>THE LAY OF ST. AMBROSE</p>
   <p>“ And hard by doth dwell , in St. Catherine 's cell , Ambrose , the anchorite old and grey . ” — THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Ambrose the anchorite old and grey</l>
     <l n="2">Larruped himself in his lonely cell ,</l>
     <l n="3">And many a welt on his pious pelt</l>
     <l n="4">The scourge evoked as it rose and fell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">For hours together the flagellant leather</l>
     <l n="6">Went whacketty-whack with his groans of pain ;</l>
     <l n="7">And the lay-brothers said , with a wag of the head ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ Ambrose has been at the bottle again . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And such , in sooth , was the sober truth ;</l>
     <l n="10">For the single fault of this saintly soul</l>
     <l n="11">Was a desert thirst for the cup accurst ,—</l>
     <l n="12">A quenchless love for the Flowing Bowl .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">When he woke at morn with a head forlorn</l>
     <l n="14">And a taste like a last-year swallow 's nest ,</l>
     <l n="15">He would kneel and pray , then rise and flay</l>
     <l n="16">His sinful body like all possessed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Frequently tempted , he fell from grace ,</l>
     <l n="18">And as often he found the devil to pay ;</l>
     <l n="19">But by diligent scourging and diligent purging</l>
     <l n="20">He managed to keep Old Nick at bay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">This was the plight of our anchorite ,—</l>
     <l n="22">An endless penance condemned to dree ,—</l>
     <l n="23">When it chanced one day there came his way</l>
     <l n="24">A Mystical Book with a golden Key .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">This Mystical Book was a guide to health ,</l>
     <l n="26">That none might follow and go astray ;</l>
     <l n="27">While a turn of the Key unlocked the wealth</l>
     <l n="28">That all unknown in the Scriptures lay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Disease is sin , the Book defined ;</l>
     <l n="30">Sickness is error to which men cling ;</l>
     <l n="31">Pain is merely a state of mind ,</l>
     <l n="32">And matter a non-existent thing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">If a tooth should ache , or a leg should break ,</l>
     <l n="34">You simply “ affirm ” and it 's sound again .</l>
     <l n="35">Cut and contusion are only delusion ,</l>
     <l n="36">And indigestion a fancied pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">For pain is naught if you “ hold a thought , ”</l>
     <l n="38">Fevers fly at your simple say ;</l>
     <l n="39">You have but to affirm , and every germ</l>
     <l n="40">Will fold up its tent and steal away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">. . . . . . . . . .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="42">From matin gong to even-song</l>
     <l n="43">Ambrose pondered this mystic lore ,</l>
     <l n="44">Till what had seemed fiction took on a conviction</l>
     <l n="45">That words had never possessed before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">“ If pain , ” quoth he , “ is a state of mind ,</l>
     <l n="47">If a rough hair shirt to silk is kin ,—</l>
     <l n="48">If these things are error , pray where 's the terror</l>
     <l n="49">In scourging and purging oneself of sin ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">“ It certainly seemeth good to me ,</l>
     <l n="51">By and large , in part and in whole .</l>
     <l n="52">I 'll put it in practice and find if it fact is ,</l>
     <l n="53">Or only a mystical rigmarole . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="54">. . . . . . . . . .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="55">The very next night our anchorite</l>
     <l n="56">Of the Flowing Bowl drank long and deep .</l>
     <l n="57">He argued this wise : “ New Thought applies</l>
     <l n="58">No fitter to lamb than it does to sheep . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="59">When he woke at morn with a head forlorn</l>
     <l n="60">And a taste akin to a parrot 's cage ,</l>
     <l n="61">He knelt and prayed , then up and flayed</l>
     <l n="62">His sinful flesh in a righteous rage .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="63">Whacketty-whack on breast and back ,</l>
     <l n="64">Whacketty-whack , before , behind ;</l>
     <l n="65">But he held the thought as he laid it on ,</l>
     <l n="66">“ Pain is merely a state of mind . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="67">Whacketty-whack on breast and back ,</l>
     <l n="68">Whacketty-whack on calf and shin ;</l>
     <l n="69">And the lay-brothers said , with a wag of the head ,</l>
     <l n="70">“ Ai n't he the glutton for discipline ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="71">. . . . . . . . . .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="72">Now every night our anchorite</l>
     <l n="73">Was exceedingly tight when he went to bed .</l>
     <l n="74">The scourge that once pained him no longer restrained him ,</l>
     <l n="75">Nor even the fear of an aching head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="76">For he woke at morn with a pate as clear</l>
     <l n="77">As the silvery chime of the matin bell ;</l>
     <l n="78">And without any jogging he fell to his flogging ,</l>
     <l n="79">And larruped himself in his lonely cell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="80">But the leather had lost its power to sting ;</l>
     <l n="81">To pangs of the flesh he was now immune ;</l>
     <l n="82">His rough hair shirt no longer hurt ,</l>
     <l n="83">Nor the pebbles he wore in his wooden shoon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="84">When conscience was troubled he cheerfully doubled</l>
     <l n="85">His matinal dose of discipline ;—</l>
     <l n="86">A deuce of a scourging , sufficient for purging</l>
     <l n="87">The Devil himself of original sin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="88">Whacketty-whack on breast and back ,</l>
     <l n="89">Whacketty-whack from morn to noon ;</l>
     <l n="90">Whacketty-whacketty-whacketty-whack !—</l>
     <l n="91">Till the abbey rang with the dismal tune .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="92">Deacon and prior , lay-brother and friar</l>
     <l n="93">Exclaimed at these whoppings spectacular ;</l>
     <l n="94">And even the Abbot remarked that the habit</l>
     <l n="95">Of scourging oneself might be carried too far .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="96">“ My son , ” said he , “ I am pleased to see</l>
     <l n="97">Such penance as never was known before ;</l>
     <l n="98">But you raise such a racket in dusting your jacket ,</l>
     <l n="99">The noise is becoming a bit of a bore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="100">“ How would it do if you whaled yourself</l>
     <l n="101">From eight to ten or from one to three ?</l>
     <l n="102">Or if ‘ More ’ is your motto , pray hire a grotto ;</l>
     <l n="103">I know of one you can have rent free . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="104">. . . . . . . . . .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="105">Ambrose the anchorite bowed his head ,</l>
     <l n="106">And girded his loins and went away .</l>
     <l n="107">He rented a cavern not far from a tavern ,</l>
     <l n="108">And tippled by night and scourged by day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="109">The more the penance the more the sin ,</l>
     <l n="110">The more he whopped him the more he drank ;</l>
     <l n="111">Till his hair fell out and his cheeks fell in ,</l>
     <l n="112">And his corpulent figure grew long and lank .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="113">At Whitsuntide he up and died ,</l>
     <l n="114">While flaying himself for his final spree .</l>
     <l n="115">And who shall say whether ‘ twas liquor or leather</l>
     <l n="116">That hurried him into eternity ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="117">They made him a saint , as well they might ,</l>
     <l n="118">And gave him a beautiful aureole .</l>
     <l n="119">And — somehow or other , this circle of light</l>
     <l n="120">Suggests the rim of the Flowing Bowl .</l>

   <p>You know my “ pomes . ” Well , old man , I was pretty young when I got them out of my system , and they seem rather raw to me now — I 'm getting along , you know ; so I 've been thinking that I 'd do ‘ em over again , file ‘ em down , as we used to say . Enclosed is the result of my labors .</p>
   <p>I presume you are wondering why I have done them into United States ; but you know perfectly well that a poet as much alive as I am to-day must not only keep up with the procession , but choose a thought-vehicle that has good springs to it — “ beaucoup resiliency , ” I s'pose you 'd call it .</p>
   <p>I hope you will like these new lines of mine better than their prototypes .</p>

    <head>THE PASSIONAL NOTE</head>
    <head>“ The erotic motive is almost entirely absent from American poetry . Even our younger American poets are more profoundly interested in the why and wherefore of things than in the girdle of Helen or the gleaming limbs of ‘ the white implacable Aphrodite . ’ ” — MR. SYLVESTER VIERECK .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the years of my season erotic ,</l>
     <l n="2">When Eros was lord of my days ,</l>
     <l n="3">And I loved , with a love idiotic ,</l>
     <l n="4">The Mabels and Madges and Mays ;</l>
     <l n="5">When a purple and passionate lyric</l>
     <l n="6">Would sing all the night in my head ,—</l>
     <l n="7">I yearned , like the young Mr. Viereck ,</l>
     <l n="8">For everything red .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">I doted on poems of passion ,</l>
     <l n="10">And put my own pantings in rime ,</l>
     <l n="11">To celebrate , after a fashion ,</l>
     <l n="12">The damsels who took up my time .</l>
     <l n="13">I fed upon Swinburne , believe me ,</l>
     <l n="14">I feasted on Byron and Burns ,</l>
     <l n="15">And couplets from Sappho would give me</l>
     <l n="16">Most exquisite turns .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">How apparent it was that our songbirds —</l>

     <l n="19">And Bryant and Drake — were the wrong birds</l>
     <l n="20">To pipe to the passional strain .</l>
     <l n="21">There was , in a word , nothing doing</l>
     <l n="22">In all of the rimes that they wrote ;</l>
     <l n="23">They seemed to be always pursuing</l>
     <l n="24">The ethical note .</l>

     <l n="25">What truth , I inquired , was so mighty ,</l>
     <l n="26">What ethical thing was so rare ,</l>
     <l n="27">As the limbs of the white Aphrodite</l>
     <l n="28">Or a strand of her heaven-kissed hair !</l>
     <l n="29">The girdle of red-headed Helen</l>
     <l n="30">Outweighed all the wherefores and whys ,</l>

     <l n="32">A pair of blue eyes .</l>

     <l n="36">Provoked by these passionate lays .</l>
     <l n="37">I 've tinned — and I can n't say I 've missed ‘ em —</l>
     <l n="38">The poems of passion and sin .</l>
