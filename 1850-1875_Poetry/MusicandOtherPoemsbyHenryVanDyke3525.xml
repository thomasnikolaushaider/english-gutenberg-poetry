        <l n="4">Then breathed her wonder and her woe forlorn</l>

        <l n="9">To sorrow , and to joy impart</l>
        <l n="10">A heavenly tone that keeps it undefiled ,—</l>
        <l n="11">Thou art the child</l>
        <l n="12">Of Amor , and by right divine</l>
        <l n="13">A throne of love is thine ,</l>

        <l n="25">Thy measured foot-fall , ringing light and clear</l>
        <l n="26">Above the unmeaning noises and the unruly strife ;</l>

       <l n="6">Of shaded lamp some friendly poet 's lay ,</l>
       <l n="7">Or shepherding the children at their play ,—</l>
       <l n="8">The same sweet self , and my unchanged delight .</l>

       <l n="12">The magic of thy beauty that doth range</l>
       <l n="13">Through many moods with infinite surprise ,—</l>
       <l n="14">Never the same , and sweeter with each change .</l>

      <head>THE WIND OF SORROW</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The fire of love was burning , yet so low</l>
       <l n="2">That in the dark we scarce could see its rays ,</l>
       <l n="3">And in the light of perfect-placid days</l>
       <l n="4">Nothing but smouldering embers dull and slow .</l>
       <l n="5">Vainly , for love 's delight , we sought to throw</l>
       <l n="6">New pleasures on the pyre to make it blaze :</l>
       <l n="7">In life 's calm air and tranquil-prosperous ways</l>
       <l n="8">We missed the radiant heat of long ago .</l>

       <l n="12">Across the gulf of darkness and salt tears ,</l>
       <l n="13">Into life 's calm the wind of sorrow came ,</l>
       <l n="14">And fanned the fire of love to clearest flame .</l>

      <head>A LEGEND OF SERVICE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It pleased the Lord of Angels ( praise His name ! )</l>
       <l n="2">To hear , one day , report from those who came</l>
       <l n="3">With pitying sorrow , or exultant joy ,</l>
       <l n="4">To tell of earthly tasks in His employ :</l>
       <l n="5">For some were sorry when they saw how slow</l>
       <l n="6">The stream of heavenly love on earth must flow ;</l>
       <l n="7">And some were glad because their eyes had seen ,</l>
       <l n="8">Along its banks , fresh flowers and living green .</l>
       <l n="9">So , at a certain hour , before the throne</l>
       <l n="10">The youngest angel , Asmiel , stood alone ;</l>
       <l n="11">Nor glad , nor sad , but full of earnest thought ,</l>
       <l n="12">And thus his tidings to the Master brought :</l>
       <l n="13">“ Lord , in the city Lupon I have found</l>
       <l n="14">“ Three servants of thy holy name , renowned</l>
       <l n="15">“ Above their fellows . One is very wise ,</l>
       <l n="16">“ With thoughts that ever range above the skies ;</l>
       <l n="17">“ And one is gifted with the golden speech</l>
       <l n="18">“ That makes men glad to hear when he will teach ;</l>
       <l n="19">“ And one , with no rare gift or grace endued ,</l>
       <l n="20">“ Has won the people 's love by doing good .</l>
       <l n="21">“ With three such saints Lupon is trebly blest ;</l>
       <l n="22">“ But , Lord , I fain would know , which loves Thee best ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="23">Then spake the Lord of Angels , to whose look</l>
       <l n="24">The hearts of all are like an open book :</l>
       <l n="25">“ In every soul the secret thought I read ,</l>
       <l n="26">“ And well I know who loves me best indeed .</l>
       <l n="27">“ But every life has pages vacant still ,</l>
       <l n="28">“ Whereon a man may write the thing he will ;</l>
       <l n="29">“ Therefore I read in silence , day by day ,</l>
       <l n="30">“ And wait for hearts untaught to learn my way .</l>
       <l n="31">“ But thou shalt go to Lupon , to the three</l>
       <l n="32">“ Who serve me there , and take this word from me :</l>
       <l n="33">“ Tell each of them his Master bids him go</l>
       <l n="34">“ Alone to Spiran 's huts , across the snow ;</l>
       <l n="35">“ There he shall find a certain task for me :</l>
       <l n="36">“ But what , I do not tell to them nor thee .</l>
       <l n="37">“ Give thou the message , make my word the test ,</l>
       <l n="38">“ And crown for me the one who answers best . ”</l>
       <l n="39">Silent the angel stood , with folded hands ,</l>
       <l n="40">To take the imprint of his Lord 's commands ;</l>
       <l n="41">Then drew one breath , obedient and elate ,</l>
       <l n="42">And passed , the self-same hour , through Lupon 's gate .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="43">First to the Temple door he made his way ;</l>
       <l n="44">And there , because it was an holy-day ,</l>
       <l n="45">He saw the folk by thousands thronging , stirred</l>
       <l n="46">By ardent thirst to hear the preacher 's word .</l>
       <l n="47">Then , while the echoes murmured Bernol 's name ,</l>
       <l n="48">Through aisles that hushed behind him , Bernol came ;</l>
       <l n="49">Strung to the keenest pitch of conscious might ,</l>
       <l n="50">With lips prepared and firm , and eyes alight .</l>
       <l n="51">One moment at the pulpit steps he knelt</l>
       <l n="52">In silent prayer , and on his shoulder felt</l>
       <l n="53">The angel 's hand :— “ The Master bids thee go</l>
       <l n="54">“ Alone to Spiran 's huts , across the snow ,</l>
       <l n="55">“ To serve Him there . ” Then Bernol 's hidden face</l>
       <l n="56">Went white as death , and for about the space</l>
       <l n="57">Of ten slow heart-beats there was no reply ;</l>
       <l n="58">Till Bernol looked around and whispered , “ WHY ? ”</l>
       <l n="59">But answer to his question came there none ;</l>
       <l n="60">The angel sighed , and with a sigh was gone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="61">Within the humble house where Malvin spent</l>
       <l n="62">His studious years , on holy things intent ,</l>
       <l n="63">Sweet stillness reigned ; and there the angel found</l>
       <l n="64">The saintly sage immersed in thought profound ,</l>
       <l n="65">Weaving with patient toil and willing care</l>
       <l n="66">A web of wisdom , wonderful and fair :</l>
       <l n="67">A seamless robe for Truth 's great bridal meet ,</l>
       <l n="68">And needing but one thread to be complete .</l>
       <l n="69">Then Asmiel touched his hand , and broke the thread</l>
       <l n="70">Of fine-spun thought , and very gently said ,</l>
       <l n="71">“ The One of whom thou thinkest bids thee go</l>
       <l n="72">“ Alone to Spiran 's huts , across the snow ,</l>
       <l n="73">“ To serve Him there . ” With sorrow and surprise</l>
       <l n="74">Malvin looked up , reluctance in his eyes .</l>
       <l n="75">The broken thought , the strangeness of the call ,</l>
       <l n="76">The perilous passage of the mountain-wall ,</l>
       <l n="77">The solitary journey , and the length</l>
       <l n="78">Of ways unknown , too great for his frail strength ,</l>
       <l n="79">Appalled him . With a doubtful brow</l>
       <l n="80">He scanned the doubtful task , and muttered “ HOW ? ”</l>
       <l n="81">But Asmiel answered , as he turned to go ,</l>
       <l n="82">With cold , disheartened voice , “ I do not know . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="83">Now as he went , with fading hope , to seek</l>
       <l n="84">The third and last to whom God bade him speak ,</l>
       <l n="85">Scarce twenty steps away whom should he meet</l>
       <l n="86">But Fermor , hurrying cheerful down the street ,</l>
       <l n="87">With ready heart that faced his work like play ,</l>
       <l n="88">And joyed to find it greater every day !</l>
       <l n="89">The angel stopped him with uplifted hand ,</l>
       <l n="90">And gave without delay his Lord 's command :</l>
       <l n="91">“ He whom thou servest here would have thee go</l>
       <l n="92">“ Alone to Spiran 's huts , across the snow ,</l>
       <l n="93">“ To serve Him there . ” Ere Asmiel breathed again</l>
       <l n="94">The eager answer leaped to meet him , “ WHEN ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="95">The angel 's face with inward joy grew bright ,</l>
       <l n="96">And all his figure glowed with heavenly light ;</l>
       <l n="97">He took the golden circlet from his brow</l>
       <l n="98">And gave the crown to Fermor , answering , “ Now !</l>
       <l n="99">“ For thou hast met the Master 's bidden test ,</l>
       <l n="100">“ And I have found the man who loves Him best .</l>
       <l n="101">“ Not thine , nor mine , to question or reply</l>
       <l n="102">“ When He commands us , asking ‘ how ? ’ or ‘ why ? ’</l>
       <l n="103">“ He knows the cause ; His ways are wise and just ;</l>
       <l n="104">“ Who serves the King must serve with perfect trust . ”</l>

      <head>THE VAIN KING</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">In robes of Tyrian blue the King was drest ,</l>
       <l n="2">A jewelled collar shone upon his breast ,</l>
       <l n="3">A giant ruby glittered in his crown —</l>
       <l n="4">Lord of rich lands and many a splendid town .</l>
       <l n="5">In him the glories of an ancient line</l>
       <l n="6">Of sober kings , who ruled by right divine ,</l>
       <l n="7">Were centred ; and to him with loyal awe</l>
       <l n="8">The people looked for leadership and law .</l>
       <l n="9">Ten thousand knights , the safeguard of the land ,</l>
       <l n="10">Lay like a single sword within his hand ;</l>
       <l n="11">A hundred courts , with power of life and death ,</l>
       <l n="12">Proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath ;</l>
       <l n="13">And all the sacred growths that men had known</l>
       <l n="14">Of order and of rule upheld his throne .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">Proud was the King : yet not with such a heart</l>
       <l n="16">As fits a man to play a royal part .</l>
       <l n="17">Not his the pride that honours as a trust</l>
       <l n="18">The right to rule , the duty to be just :</l>
       <l n="19">Not his the dignity that bends to bear</l>
       <l n="20">The monarch 's yoke , the master 's load of care ,</l>
       <l n="21">And labours like the peasant at his gate ,</l>
       <l n="22">To serve the people and protect the State .</l>
       <l n="23">Another pride was his , and other joys :</l>
       <l n="24">To him the crown and sceptre were but toys ,</l>
       <l n="25">With which he played at glory 's idle game ,</l>
       <l n="26">To please himself and win the wreaths of fame .</l>
       <l n="27">The throne his fathers held from age to age ,</l>
       <l n="28">To his ambition , seemed a fitting stage</l>
       <l n="29">Built for King Martin to display at will ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="31">No conscious child , that , spoiled with praising , tries</l>

       <l n="33">No favourite mountebank , whose acting draws</l>
       <l n="34">From gaping crowds loud thunder of applause ,</l>
       <l n="35">Was vainer than the King : his only thirst</l>
       <l n="36">Was to be hailed , in every race , the first .</l>
       <l n="37">When tournament was held , in knightly guise</l>
       <l n="38">The King would ride the lists and win the prize ;</l>
       <l n="39">When music charmed the court , with golden lyre</l>
       <l n="40">The King would take the stage and lead the choir ;</l>
       <l n="41">In hunting , his the lance to slay the boar ;</l>
       <l n="42">In hawking , see his falcon highest soar ;</l>
       <l n="43">In painting , he would wield the master 's brush ;</l>
       <l n="44">In high debate ,— “ the King is speaking ! Hush ! ”</l>
       <l n="45">Thus , with a restless heart , in every field</l>
       <l n="46">He sought renown , and found his subjects yield</l>

       <l n="51">And on the seat of honour justice slept .</l>
       <l n="52">The strong trod down the weak ; the helpless poor</l>
       <l n="53">Groaned under burdens grievous to endure .</l>
       <l n="54">The nation 's wealth was spent in vain display ,</l>

       <l n="70">Beside the river , seeking to devise</l>
       <l n="71">New ways to show his skill to wondering eyes .</l>
       <l n="72">There in the stream a patient fisher stood ,</l>
       <l n="73">And cast his line across the rippling flood .</l>
       <l n="74">His silver spoil lay near him on the green :</l>
       <l n="75">“ Such fish , ” the courtiers cried , “ were never seen !</l>
       <l n="76">“ Three salmon longer than a cloth-yard shaft —</l>

       <l n="82">The fisher turned , came near , and bent his knee :</l>
       <l n="83">“ ‘ T is not for kings to strive with such as me ;</l>
       <l n="84">“ Yet if the King commands it , I obey .</l>
       <l n="85">“ But one condition of the strife I pray :</l>
       <l n="86">“ The fisherman who brings the least to land</l>
       <l n="87">“ Shall do whate'er the other may command . ”</l>
       <l n="88">Loud laughed the King : “ A foolish fisher thou !</l>

       <l n="90">So to Prince John , a sober soul , sedate</l>

       <l n="92">While to the novel game with eager zest</l>
       <l n="93">He all his time and all his powers addrest .</l>
       <l n="94">Sure such a sight was never seen before !</l>
       <l n="95">For robed and crowned the monarch trod the shore ;</l>
       <l n="96">His golden hooks were decked with feathers fine ,</l>
       <l n="97">His jewelled reel ran out a silken line .</l>
       <l n="98">With kingly strokes he flogged the crystal stream ,</l>
       <l n="99">Far-off the salmon saw his tackle gleam ;</l>
       <l n="100">Careless of kings , they eyed with calm disdain</l>
       <l n="101">The gaudy lure , and Martin fished in vain .</l>
       <l n="102">On Friday , when the week was almost spent ,</l>
       <l n="103">He scanned his empty creel with discontent ,</l>
       <l n="104">Called for a net , and cast it far and wide ,</l>

       <l n="106">Then came the fisher to conclude the match ,</l>

       <l n="108">A hundred salmon , greater than before —</l>
       <l n="109">“ I win ! ” he cried : “ the King must pay the score . ”</l>
       <l n="110">Then Martin , angry , threw his tackle down :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="112">Nay , thou hast lost them both , ” the fisher said ;</l>
