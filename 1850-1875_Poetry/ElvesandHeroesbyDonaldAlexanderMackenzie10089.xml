    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">THE ELVES .</p>
    <p n="2">The immemorial folk-beliefs of our native land are passing away , but they still retain for us a poetic appeal , not only on account of the glamour of early associations , but also because they afford us inviting glimpses of the mental habits and inherent characteristics of the men and women of past generations . When we re-tell the old tales of our ancestors , we sit beside them over the peat-fire ; and , as we glory with them in their strong heroes , and share their elemental joys and fears , we breathe the palpitating air of that old mysterious world of theirs , peopled by spirits beautiful , and strange , and awe-inspiring .</p>
    <p n="3">The attitude of the Gael towards the supernatural , and his general outlook upon life in times gone by , was not associated with unbroken gloom ; nor was he always an ineffectual dreamer and melancholy fatalist . These attributes belong chiefly to the Literary Celt of latter-day conception — the Celt of Arnold and Renan , and other writers following in their wake , who have woven misty impressions of a people whom they have met as strangers , and never really understood . Celtic literature is not a morbid literature . In Highland poetry there is more light than shadow , much symbolism , but no vagueness ; pictures are presented in minute detail ; stanzas are cunningly wrought in a spirit of keen artistry ; and the literary style is direct and clear and comprehensible . In Highland folklore we find associated with the haunting “ fear of things invisible , ” common to all peoples in early stages of development , a confident feeling of security inspired by the minute observances of ceremonial practices . We also note a distinct tendency to discriminate between spirits , some of which are invariably friendly , some merely picturesque , and perhaps fearsome , and others constantly harbouring a desire to work evil upon mankind . Associated with belief in the efficacy of propitiatory offerings and “ ceremonies of riddance , ” is the ethical suggestion that good wishes and good deeds influence spirits to perform acts of kindly intent .</p>
    <p n="4">Of fairies the Highlanders spoke , as they are still prone to do in these districts where belief in them is not yet extinct , with no small degree of regard and affection . It may be that “ the good folk ” and the “ peace-people ” ( sitchean ) were so called that good intention might be compelled by the conjuring influence of a name , as well as to avoid giving offence by uttering real names , as if it were desired to exercise a magical influence by their use . Be that as it may , it is evident from Highland folk-tales that the fairies were oftener the friends than the foes of mankind . When men and women were lured to their dwellings they rarely suffered injury ; indeed , the fairies appeared to have taken pleasure in their company . To such as they favoured they imparted the secrets of their skill in the arts of piping , of sword-making , etc . At sowing time or harvest they were at the service of human friends . On the needy they took pity . They never failed in a promise ; they never forgot an act of kindness , which they invariably rewarded seven-fold . Against those who wronged them they took speedy vengeance . It would appear that on these humanised spirits of his conception the Highlander left , as one would expect him to do , the impress of his own character — his shrewdness and high sense of honour , his love of music and gaiety , his warmth of heart and love of comrades , and his indelible hatred of tyranny and wrong .</p>
    <p n="5">The Highland “ wee folk ” are not so diminutive as the fairies of England — at least that type of fairy , beloved of the poet , which hovers bee-like over flowers and feeds on honey-dew . Power they had to shrink in stature and to render themselves invisible , but they are invariably “ little people , ” from three to four feet high . It may be that the Gael 's conception of humanised spirits may not have been uninfluenced by the traditions of that earlier diminutive race whose arrow-heads of flint were so long regarded as “ elf-bolts . ” The fairies dwelt only in grassy knolls , on the summits of high hills , and inside cliffs . Although capable of living for several centuries , they were not immortal . They required food , and borrowed meal and cooking utensils from human beings , and always returned what they received on loan . They could be heard within the knolls grinding corn and working at their anvils , and they were adepts at spinning and weaving and harvesting . When they went on long journeys they became invisible , and were carried through the air on eddies of western wind .</p>
    <p n="6">At the seasonal changes of the year , “ the wee folk ” were for several days on end inspired , like all other supernatural furies , with enmity against mankind . Their evil influences were negatived by spells and charms . We who still hang on our walls at Christmas the mystic holly , are unconsciously perpetuating an old-world custom connected with belief in the efficacy of the magical circle to protect us against evil spirits . And in our concern about luck , our proneness to believe in omens , the influence of colours and numbers , in dreams and in prophetic warnings , we retain as much of the spirit as the poetry of the religion of our remote ancestors .</p>
    <p n="7">THE HEROES .</p>
    <p n="8">The heroes , with the exception of Cuchullin , who appear in this volume , figure in the tales and poems of the Ossianic or Fian Cycle , which is common to Ireland and to Scotland . They have been neglected by our Scottish poets since Gavin Douglas and Barbour . In Ireland the Fians are a band of militia — the original Fenians . In Scotland the tales vary considerably , and belong to the hunting period before the introduction of agriculture . But in this country , as well as in Ireland , they are evidently influenced by historic happenings . There are tales of Norse conflicts , as well as tales of adventure among giants and spirits .</p>
    <p n="9">The cycle had evidently remote beginnings . When we find Diarmid and Grainnè , like Paris and Helen , the cause of conflict and disaster ; and Diarmid , like Achilles , charmed of body , and vulnerable only on his heel-spot , we incline to the theory that from a mid-European centre migrating “ waves ” swept over prehistoric Greece , and left traces of their mythology and folk-lore in Homer , while other “ waves , ” sweeping northward , bequeathed to us as a literary inheritance the Celtic folk-tales , in which the deeds and magical attributes of remote tribal heroes and humanised deities are co-mingled and perpetuated .</p>
    <p n="10">On fragments of these folk-tales the poet Macpherson reared his Ossianic epic , in imitation of the Iliad and Paradise Lost .</p>
    <p n="11">The “ Death of Cuchullin ” is a rendering in verse of an Irish prose translation of a fragment of the Cuchullin Cycle , which moves in the Bronze Age period . Cuchullin , with “ the light of heroes ” on his forehead , is also reminiscent of Achilles . One of the few Cuchullin tales found in Scotland is that which relates his conflict with his son , and bears a striking similarity to the legend of Sohrab and Rustum . Macpherson also drew from this Cycle in composing his Ossian , and mingled it with the other , with which it has no connection .</p>
    <p n="12">The third great Celtic Cycle — the Arthurian — bears close resemblances , as Campbell , of “ The West Highland Tales , ” has shown , to the Fian Cycle , and had evidently a common origin . Its value as a source of literary inspiration has been fully appreciated , but the Fian and Cuchullin cycles still await , like virgin soil , to yield an abundant harvest for the poets of the future .</p>
    <p n="13">Notes on the folk-beliefs and tales will be found at the end of this volume .</p>
    <p n="14">Some of the short poems have appeared in the “ Glasgow Herald ” and “ Inverness Courier ” ; the three tales appeared in the “ Celtic Review . ”</p>

     <l n="1">In the knoll that is the greenest ,</l>

     <l n="3">And on the lonely ben-top</l>
     <l n="4">The wee folk bide ;</l>
     <l n="5">They 'll flit among the heather ,</l>
     <l n="6">And trip upon the brae —</l>

     <l n="8">As o'er the moor at midnight</l>
     <l n="9">The wee folk pass ,</l>
     <l n="10">They whisper ‘ mong the rushes</l>
     <l n="11">And o'er the green grass ;</l>
     <l n="12">All through the marshy places</l>
     <l n="13">They glint and pass away —</l>
     <l n="14">The light folk , the lone folk , the folk that will not stay .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">O many a fairy milkmaid</l>
     <l n="16">With the one eye blind ,</l>
     <l n="17">Is ‘ mid the lonely mountains</l>
     <l n="18">By the red deer hind ;</l>
     <l n="19">Not one will wait to greet me ,</l>
     <l n="20">For they have naught to say —</l>

     <l n="25">To the elfin brood ;</l>

     <l n="48">We 'll ne'er them send away —</l>

     <l n="50">O never wrong the wee folk —</l>
     <l n="51">The red folk and green ,</l>
     <l n="52">Nor name them on the Fridays ,</l>
     <l n="53">Or at Hallowe'en ;</l>
     <l n="54">The helpless and unwary then</l>
     <l n="55">And bairns they lure away —</l>
     <l n="56">The fierce folk , the angry folk , the folk that steal and slay .</l>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">The Wee Folk .— In Gaelic they are usually called “ The Peace People ” ( sithchean ) . Other names are “ Wee Folk ” ( daoine beaga ) ; “ Light Folk ” ( slaugh eutrom ) , etc . As in the Lowlands , they are also referred to as “ guid fowk ” and “ guid neighbours . ”</p>
    <p n="2">The Banshee ( Beanshith ) .— Sometimes referred to as “ The Fairy Queen , ” sometimes as “ The Green Lady . ” She sings a song while she washes the clothes of one about to meet a swift and tragic fate . In the Fian poems she converses with those who see her , and foretells the fate of warriors going to battle .</p>
    <p n="3">The Blue Men of the Minch ( Na Fir Ghorm ) .— Between the Shant Isles ( Charmed Isles ) and Lewis is the “ Stream of the Blue Men . ” They are the “ sea-horses ” of the island Gaels . Their presence in the strait was believed to be the cause of its billowy restlessness and swift currents .</p>
    <p n="4">The Changeling .— When the fairies robbed a mother of her babe , they left behind a useless , old , and peevish fairy , who took the form of a child . This belief may have originated in the assumption that when a baby became ill and fretful , it was a changeling .</p>
    <p n="5">The Urisk is , if anything , a personification of fear . It is a silent , cloudy shape which haunts lonely moors , and follows travellers , but rarely does more than scare them .</p>
    <p n="6">My Fairy Lover .— Fairies fell in love with human beings , and deserted them when their love was returned . Women of unsound mind , given to wandering alone in solitary places , were believed to be the victims of fairy love .</p>
    <p n="7">Yon Fairy Dog ( An Cu Sith ) was heard howling on stormy nights . He was “ big as a stirk , ” one informant has declared The “ fearsome tail ” appears to have been not the least impressive thing about it . The MacCodrums were brave and fearless , and were supposed to be descended from Seals , which were believed to be human beings under spells .</p>
    <p n="8">My Gunna .— This kindly , but solitary , elf herded cattle by night , and prevented them from falling over the rocks . He was seen only by those gifted with the faculty of “ second sight . ” The Gunna resembles the Lowland “ Brownie . ”</p>
    <p n="9">Her Evil Eye .— Belief in the Evil Eye is still quite common , even among educated people , in the Highlands . Not a few children wear “ the cord , ” to which a silver coin is appended , as a charm against the influence of “ the eye . ”</p>
    <p n="10">The Little Old Man of the Barn ( Bodachan Sabhaill ) .— Like the Gunna , he is a variety the kindly Brownie , and assisted the needy .</p>
    <p n="11">Nimble Men ( Na Fir Chlis ) are “ The Merry Dancers , ” or Aurora Borealis . It was believed that , when the streamers were coloured , the “ men and maids ” were dancing , and that after the dance the lovers fought for the love of the queen . When the streamers are particularly vivid , a pink cloud is seen below them , and this is called “ the pool of blood . ” It drips upon blood-stones , the spots on which are referred to as fairy blood ( fuil siochaire ) . A wizard could , by waving his wand , summon the “ Nimble Men ” to dance in the northern sky .</p>
    <p n="12">The Water Horse haunted lonely lochs , and lured human beings to a terrible death . When a hand was laid on its main , power to remove it was withdrawn .</p>
    <p n="13">A Cursing — The Gaelic curses are quaint in translation , but terrible in the original .</p>
    <p n="14">Bonnach Fallaidh .— It was considered unlucky to throw away the remnants of a baking . So the good-wife made a little bannock , which was pierced in the middle , as a charm against fairy influence . It was given to a child for performing an errand , but the charm would be broken if the reason for gifting it were explained . That was the good-wife 's secret . It was also unlucky to count the bannocks , and when they fell , “ bad luck ” was foretold . Finlay 's bannock was not kneaded on the board or placed on the brander , but , unlike the other bannocks , was toasted in front of the fire .</p>
    <p n="15">The Gruagach was a gentlemanly Brownie , who haunted byres . It was never seen , although its shadow occasionally danced on the wall as it flitted about . Often , when chased , it was heard tittering round corners . In some barns , Clach-na-gruagach — “ the Gruagach 's stone ” — is still seen . Milkers pour an offering of milk into the hollowed stone “ for luck . ” The cream might not rise and the churn yield no butter if this service were neglected . A favourite trick of the Gruagach was to untie the cattle in the byre , so as to bring out the milkmaid , especially if she had forgotten to leave the offering of milk .</p>
    <p n="16">Tober Mhuire ( St Mary 's Well ) is situated at Tarradale , Ross-shire . When a sick person asks for a drink of Tober Mhuire water , it is taken as a sign of approaching death . It is a curious thing that this reverence for holy water should be perpetuated among a Presbyterian people . Wishing and curative wells are numerous in the North .</p>
    <p n="17">The Fians of Knockfarrel .— This story belongs to the Ossianic or Fian cycle of Gaelic tales in prose and verse . Hugh Miller makes reference to it , but speaks of the Fians as giants . In Strathpeffer district the tale is well known , and it is referred to in “ Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition . ” It is also localised in Skye . There are several Fian place-names in the Highlands . The warriors are supposed to lie in a charmed sleep in Craig-a-howe Cave , near Munlochy , Ross-shire . Caoilte , the swift runner , was a famous Fian . Finn was chief , and Goll and Garry were of Clan Morna , which united with the Fians . “ Moolachie ” is a little babe , and “ clarsach , ” a harp .</p>
    <p n="18">Ledbag 's Warning .— Children who twist their mouths , or squint , are warned that , if the wind changes , their contortions will remain . The fate of the flounder , which mocked the cod , is cited as a terrible example .</p>
    <p n="19">Conn , Son of the Red is a Fian tale of which several old Gaelic versions have been collected . Goll , the “ first hero ” of the Fians , slew the Red when Conn , his son , was seven years old . In the fullness of time the young hero , whom his enemies admire as well as fear , crossed the sea to avenge his father 's death , and engaged in a long and fierce duel with Goll .</p>
    <p n="20">Death of Cuchullin is from the Cuchullin Cycle of Bronze Age heroic tales . The enemy have invaded and laid waste the province of Ulster , and the chief warriors of the Red Branch , except Cuchullin , who must needs fight alone , are laid under spells by the magicians of the invaders . The poem is suffused with evidences of magical beliefs and practices . Cuchullin goes forth knowing that he will meet his doom . His name signifies “ hound of Culann . ” In his youth he slew Culann 's ferocious watch-hound which attacked him , and took its place until another was trained . It was “ geis ” ( taboo ) for him to partake of the flesh of a hound ( his totem ) , or eat at a cooking hearth ; but he must needs accept the hospitality of the witches . The satirists are satirical bards who , it was believed , could not only lampoon a hero , but infuse their compositions with magical powers like incantations . Cuchullin cannot be slain except by his own spear , which he must deliver up to a satirist who demands it . Emania , the capital of Ulster , was the home of the Bed Branch warriors .</p>
    <p n="21">Sleepy Song .— When Diarmid eloped with Grianne , as Paris did with Helen , the Fians followed them , so that Finn , their chief , might be avenged . Diarmid , who is the unwilling victim of Grainne 's spells , dreads to meet Finn , and is in constant fear of discovery .</p>
