    <head>THE FORSYTE SAGA :</head>
     <l n="1">VOLUME 1 . THE MAN OF PROPERTY</l>
     <l n="2">/ gutenberg / etext01 / mnprp10. txt</l>
   </lg>
   <p>PASSAGES FROM THE TEXT :</p>
   <p>The simple truth , which underlies the whole story , that where sex attraction is utterly and definitely lacking in one partner to a union , no amount of pity , or reason , or duty , or what not , can overcome a repulsion implicit in Nature .</p>
   <p>The tragedy of whose life is the very simple , uncontrollable tragedy of being unlovable , without quite a thick enough skin to be thoroughly unconscious of the fact . Not even Fleur loves Soames as he feels he ought to be loved . But in pitying Soames , readers incline , perhaps , to animus against Irene : After all , they think , he was n't a bad fellow , it was n't his fault ; she ought to have forgiven him , and so on !</p>
   <p>“ Let the dead Past bury its dead ” would be a better saying if the Past ever died . The persistence of the Past is one of those tragi-comic blessings which each new age denies , coming cocksure on to the stage to mouth its claim to a perfect novelty .</p>
   <p>The figure of Irene , never , as the reader may possibly have observed , present , except through the senses of other characters , is a concretion of disturbing Beauty impinging on a possessive world .</p>
   <p>She turned back into the drawing-room ; but in a minute came out , and stood as if listening . Then she came stealing up the stairs , with a kitten in her arms . He could see her face bent over the little beast , which was purring against her neck . Why could n't she look at him like that ?</p>
   <p>But though the impingement of Beauty and the claims of Freedom on a possessive world are the main prepossessions of the Forsyte Saga , it cannot be absolved from the charge of embalming the upper-middle class .</p>
   <p>When a Forsyte was engaged , married , or born , the Forsytes were present ; when a Forsyte died — but no Forsyte had as yet died ; they did not die ; death being contrary to their principles , they took precautions against it , the instinctive precautions of highly vitalized persons who resent encroachments on their property .</p>
   <p>“ It 's my opinion , ” he said unexpectedly , “ that it 's just as well as it is . ”</p>
   <p>The eldest by some years of all the Forsytes , she held a peculiar position amongst them . Opportunists and egotists one and all — though not , indeed , more so than their neighbours — they quailed before her incorruptible figure , and , when opportunities were too strong , what could they do but avoid her !</p>
   <p>“ I 'm bad , ” he said , pouting — “ been bad all the week ; do n't sleep at night . The doctor can n't tell why . He 's a clever fellow , or I should n't have him , but I get nothing out of him but bills . ”</p>
   <p>There was little sentimentality about the Forsytes . In that great London , which they had conquered and become merged in , what time had they to be sentimental ?</p>
   <p>A moment passed , and young Jolyon , turning on his heel , marched out at the door . He could hardly see ; his smile quavered . Never in all the fifteen years since he had first found out that life was no simple business , had he found it so singularly complicated .</p>
   <p>As in all self-respecting families , an emporium had been established where family secrets were bartered , and family stock priced . It was known on Forsyte ‘ Change that Irene regretted her marriage . Her regret was disapproved of . She ought to have known her own mind ; no dependable woman made these mistakes .</p>
   <p>Out of his other property , out of all the things he had collected , his silver , his pictures , his houses , his investments , he got a secret and intimate feeling ; out of her he got none .</p>
   <p>Of all those whom this strange rumour about Bosinney and Mrs. Soames reached , James was the most affected . He had long forgotten how he had hovered , lanky and pale , in side whiskers of chestnut hue , round Emily , in the days of his own courtship . He had long forgotten the small house in the purlieus of Mayfair , where he had spent the early days of his married life , or rather , he had long forgotten the early days , not the small house ,— a Forsyte never forgot a house — he had afterwards sold it at a clear profit of four hundred pounds .</p>
   <p>And those countless Forsytes , who , in the course of innumerable transactions concerned with property of all sorts ( from wives to water rights ) ....</p>
   <p>“ I now move , ‘ That the report and accounts for the year 1886 be received and adopted . ’ You second that ? Those in favour signify the same in the usual way . Contrary — no . Carried . The next business , gentlemen .... ” Soames smiled . Certainly Uncle Jolyon had a way with him !</p>
   <p>Forces regardless of family or class or custom were beating down his guard ; impending events over which he had no control threw their shadows on his head . The irritation of one accustomed to have his way was , roused against he knew not what .</p>
   <p>We are , of course , all of us the slaves of property , and I admit that it 's a question of degree , but what I call a ‘ Forsyte ’ is a man who is decidedly more than less a slave of property . He knows a good thing , he knows a safe thing , and his grip on property — it does n't matter whether it be wives , houses , money , or reputation — is his hall-mark . ” — “ Ah ! ” murmured Bosinney . “ You should patent the word . ” — “ I should like , ” said young Jolyon , “ to lecture on it : ‘ Properties and quality of a Forsyte ': This little animal , disturbed by the ridicule of his own sort , is unaffected in his motions by the laughter of strange creatures ( you or I ) . Hereditarily disposed to myopia , he recognises only the persons of his own species , amongst which he passes an existence of competitive tranquillity . ”</p>
   <p>“ My people , ” replied young Jolyon , “ are not very extreme , and they have their own private peculiarities , like every other family , but they possess in a remarkable degree those two qualities which are the real tests of a Forsyte — the power of never being able to give yourself up to anything soul and body , and the ‘ sense of property ’ . ”</p>
   <p>An unhappy marriage ! No ill-treatment — only that indefinable malaise , that terrible blight which killed all sweetness under Heaven ; and so from day to day , from night to night , from week to week , from year to year , till death should end it .</p>
   <p>The more I see of people the more I am convinced that they are never good or bad — merely comic , or pathetic . You probably do n't agree with me ! ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Do n't touch me ! ” she cried . He caught her wrist ; she wrenched it away .</l>
     <l n="2">“ And where may you have been ? ” he asked . “ In heaven — out of this house ! ”</l>
     <l n="3">With those words she fled upstairs .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It seemed to young Jolyon that he could hear her saying : “ But , darling , it would ruin you ! ” For he himself had experienced to the full the gnawing fear at the bottom of each woman 's heart that she is a drag on the man she loves .</p>
   <p>She had come back like an animal wounded to death , not knowing where to turn , not knowing what she was doing .</p>

    <head>THE FORSYTE SAGA :</head>
     <l n="1">VOLUME 2 . INDIAN SUMMER OF A FORSYTE &amp; IN CHANCERY</l>
     <l n="2">/ gutenberg / etext01 / isoaf10. txt</l>
   </lg>
   <p>PASSAGES FROM THE TEXT :</p>
   <p>“ What do you mean by God ? ” he said ; “ there are two irreconcilable ideas of God . There 's the Unknowable Creative Principle — one believes in That . And there 's the Sum of altruism in man naturally one believes in That .</p>
   <p>She was such a decided mortal ; knew her own mind so terribly well ; wanted things so inexorably until she got them — and then , indeed , often dropped them like a hot potato . Her mother had been like that , whence had come all those tears . Not that his incompatibility with his daughter was anything like what it had been with the first Mrs. Young Jolyon . One could be amused where a daughter was concerned ; in a wife 's case one could not be amused .</p>
   <p>“ Thank you for that good lie .</p>
   <p>Love has no age , no limit ; and no death .</p>
   <p>Did Nature permit a Forsyte not to make a slave of what he adored ? Could beauty be confided to him ? Or should she not be just a visitor , coming when she would , possessed for moments which passed , to return only at her own choosing ? ‘ We are a breed of spoilers ! ’ thought Jolyon , ‘ close and greedy ; the bloom of life is not safe with us . Let her come to me as she will , when she will , not at all if she will not . Let me be just her stand-by , her perching-place ; never-never her cage ! ’</p>
   <p>.... causing the animal to wake and attack his fleas ; for though he was supposed to have none , nothing could persuade him of the fact .</p>
   <p>It 's always worth while before you do anything to consider whether it 's going to hurt another person more than is absolutely necessary . ”</p>

    <head>LINES FROM THE TEXT :</head>
     <l n="1">A thing slipped between him and all previous knowledge</l>
     <l n="2">Afraid of being afraid</l>
     <l n="3">Afraid to show emotion before his son</l>
     <l n="4">Always wanted more than he could have</l>
     <l n="5">Aromatic spirituality</l>
     <l n="6">As she will , when she will , not at all if she will not</l>
     <l n="7">Attack his fleas ; for though he was supposed to have none</l>
     <l n="8">Avoided expression of all unfashionable emotion</l>
     <l n="9">Back of beauty was harmony</l>
     <l n="10">Back of harmony was — union</l>
     <l n="11">Beauty is the devil , when you 're sensitive to it !</l>
     <l n="12">Blessed capacity of living again in the young</l>
     <l n="13">But it tired him and he was glad to sit down</l>
     <l n="14">But the thistledown was still as death</l>
     <l n="15">By the cigars they smoke , and the composers they love</l>
     <l n="16">Change — for there never was any — always upset her very much</l>
     <l n="17">Charm ; and the quieter it was , the more he liked it</l>
     <l n="18">Compassion was checked by the tone of that close voice</l>
     <l n="19">Conceived for that law a bitter distaste</l>
     <l n="20">Conscious beauty</l>
     <l n="21">Detached and brotherly attitude towards his own son</l>
     <l n="22">Did not mean to try and get out of it by vulgar explanation</l>
     <l n="23">Did not want to be told of an infirmity</l>
     <l n="24">Dislike of humbug</l>
     <l n="25">Dogs : with rudiments of altruism and a sense of God</l>
     <l n="26">Do n't care whether we 're right or wrong</l>
     <l n="27">Do n't hurt others more than is absolutely necessary</l>
     <l n="28">Early morning does not mince words</l>
     <l n="29">Era which had canonised hypocrisy</l>
     <l n="30">Evening not conspicuous for open-heartedness</l>
     <l n="31">Everything in life he wanted — except a little more breath</l>
     <l n="32">Fatigued by the insensitive , he avoided fatiguing others</l>
     <l n="33">Felt nearly young</l>
     <l n="34">Forgiven me ; but she could never forget</l>
     <l n="35">Forsytes always bat</l>
     <l n="36">Free will was the strength of any tie , and not its weakness</l>
     <l n="37">Get something out of everything you do</l>
     <l n="38">Greater expense can be incurred for less result than anywhere</l>
     <l n="39">Hard-mouthed women who laid down the law</l>
     <l n="40">He could not plead with her ; even an old man has his dignity</l>
     <l n="41">He saw himself reflected : An old-looking chap</l>
     <l n="42">Health — He did not want it at such cost</l>
     <l n="43">Horses were very uncertain</l>
     <l n="44">I have come to an end ; if you want me , here I am</l>
     <l n="45">I never stop anyone from doing anything</l>
     <l n="46">I sha n't marry a good man , Auntie , they 're so dull !</l>
     <l n="47">If not her lover in deed he was in desire</l>
     <l n="48">Importance of mundane matters became increasingly grave</l>
     <l n="49">Intolerable to be squeezed out slowly , without a say youself</l>
     <l n="50">Ironical , which is fatal to expansiveness</l>
     <l n="51">Ironically mistrustful</l>
     <l n="52">Is anything more pathetic than the faith of the young ?</l>
     <l n="53">It was their great distraction : To wait !</l>
     <l n="54">Know how not to grasp and destroy !</l>
     <l n="55">Law takes a low view of human nature</l>
     <l n="56">Let her come to me as she will , when she will ,</l>
     <l n="57">Little notion of how to butter her bread</l>
     <l n="58">Living on his capital</l>
     <l n="59">Longing to escape in generalities beset him</l>
     <l n="60">Love has no age , no limit ; and no death</l>
     <l n="61">Man had money , he was free in law and fact</l>
     <l n="62">Ministered to his daughter 's love of domination</l>
     <l n="63">More spiritual enjoyment of his coffee and cigar</l>
     <l n="64">Never give himself away</l>
     <l n="65">Never seemed to have occasion for verbal confidences</l>
     <l n="66">Never since had any real regard for conventional morality</l>
     <l n="67">Never to see yourself as others see you</l>
     <l n="68">No money ! What fate could compare with that ?</l>
     <l n="69">None of them quite knew what she meant</l>
     <l n="70">None of us — none of us can hold on for ever !</l>
     <l n="71">Not going to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds</l>
     <l n="72">Nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from afar off</l>
     <l n="73">Nothing overmastering in his feeling</l>
     <l n="74">Old men learn to forego their whims</l>
     <l n="75">One cannot see the havoc oneself is working</l>
     <l n="76">One could break away into irony — as indeed he often had to</l>
     <l n="77">One who has never known a struggle with desperation</l>
     <l n="78">One 's never had enough</l>
     <l n="79">Only aversion lasts</l>
     <l n="80">Only Time was good for sorrow</l>
     <l n="81">Own feelings were not always what mattered most</l>
     <l n="82">People who do n't live are wonderfully preserved</l>
     <l n="83">Perching-place ; never-never her cage !</l>
     <l n="84">Philosophy of one on whom the world had turned its back</l>
     <l n="85">Pity , they said , was akin to love !</l>
     <l n="86">Preferred to concentrate on the ownership of themselves</l>
     <l n="87">Putting up a brave show of being natural</l>
     <l n="88">Quiet possession of his own property</l>
     <l n="89">Quivering which comes when a man has received a deadly insult</l>
     <l n="90">Self-consciousness is a handicap</l>
     <l n="91">Selfishness of age had not set its proper grip on him</l>
     <l n="92">Sense of justice stifled condemnation</l>
     <l n="93">Servants knew everything , and suspected the rest</l>
     <l n="94">Shall not expect this time more than I can get , or she can give</l>
     <l n="95">She used to expect me to say it more often than I felt it</l>
     <l n="96">Sideways look which had reduced many to silence in its time</l>
     <l n="97">Smiled because he could have cried</l>
     <l n="98">So difficult to be sorry for him</l>
     <l n="99">‘ So we go out ! ’ he thought ‘ No more beauty ! Nothing ? ’</l>
     <l n="100">Socialists : they want our goods</l>
     <l n="101">Sorrowful pleasure</l>
     <l n="102">Spirit of the future , with the charm of the unknown</l>
     <l n="103">Striking horror of the moral attitude</l>
     <l n="104">Sum of altruism in man</l>
     <l n="105">Surprised that he could have had so paltry an idea</l>
     <l n="106">Tenderness to the young</l>
     <l n="107">Thank you for that good lie</l>
     <l n="108">Thanks awfully</l>
     <l n="109">That dog was a good dog</l>
     <l n="110">The Queen — God bless her !</l>
     <l n="111">The soundless footsteps on the grass !</l>
     <l n="112">There was no one in any sort of authority to notice him</l>
     <l n="113">There went the past !</l>
     <l n="114">To seem to be respectable was to be</l>
     <l n="115">Too afraid of committing himself in any direction</l>
     <l n="116">Trees take little account of time</l>
     <l n="117">Unfeeling process of legal regulation</l>
     <l n="118">Unknowable Creative Principle</l>
     <l n="119">Unlikely to benefit its beneficiaries</l>
     <l n="120">Wanted things so inexorably until she got them</l>
     <l n="121">Waves of sweetness and regret flooded his soul</l>
     <l n="122">Weighing you to the ground with care and love</l>
     <l n="123">Went out as if afraid of being answered</l>
     <l n="124">What do you mean by God ?</l>
     <l n="125">When you fleece you 're sorry</l>
     <l n="126">When you 're fleeced you 're sick</l>
     <l n="127">Where Beauty was , nothing ever ran quite straight</l>
     <l n="128">Whole world was in conspiracy to limit freedom</l>
     <l n="129">With the wisdom of a long life old JoIyon did not speak</l>
     <l n="130">Witticism of which he was not the author was hardly to his taste</l>
     <l n="131">Wonderful finality about a meal</l>
     <l n="132">You have to buy experience</l>

   <p>PASSAGES FROM THE TEXT :</p>
   <p>Coercion was unpopular , parents had exalted notions of giving their offspring a good time . They spoiled their rods , spared their children , and anticipated the results with enthusiasm .</p>
   <p>And yet , in his inner tissue , there was something of the old founder of his family , a secret tenacity of soul , a dread of showing his feelings , a determination not to know when he was beaten . Sensitive , imaginative , affectionate boys get a bad time at school , but Jon had instinctively kept his nature dark , and been but normally unhappy there</p>

   <p>But I think that when we hope , we are not brave , because we are expecting something for ourselves . Chris says that hope is prayer , and if it is prayer , then all the time we are hoping , we are asking for something , and it is not brave to ask for things .</p>

   <p>“ Ah ! ” muttered Mr. Treffry , “ you 're obstinate enough , but obstinacy is n't strength . ”</p>

They were remarkable for failing to express any single one of his real thoughts , but they were full of sentiments which were not what he was truly feeling ; and when he set himself to analyse , he had such moments of delirium that he was scared , and shocked , and quite unable to write anything .

   <p>Next to him was Mrs. Hussell Barter , with that touching look to be seen on the faces of many English ladies , that look of women who are always doing their duty , their rather painful duty ; whose eyes , above cheeks creased and withered , once rose-leaf hued , now over-coloured by strong weather , are starry and anxious ; whose speech is simple , sympathetic , direct , a little shy , a little hopeless , yet always hopeful ; who are ever surrounded by children , invalids , old people , all looking to them for support ; who have never known the luxury of breaking down .</p>
   <p>The Rector , who practically never suffered , disliked the thought and sight of others ’ suffering . Up to this day , indeed , there had been none to dislike , for in answer to inquiries his wife had always said “ No , dear , no ; I 'm all right — really , it 's nothing . ” And she had always said it smiling , even when her smiling lips were white . But this morning in trying to say it she had failed to smile . Her eyes had lost their hopelessly hopeful shining , and sharply between her teeth she said : “ Send for Dr. Wilson , Hussell . ”</p>

   <p>Bertie was standing , more inscrutable and neat than ever , in a perfectly tied cravatte , perfectly cut riding breeches , and boots worn and polished till a sooty glow shone through their natural russet . Not specially dandified in his usual dress , Bertie Caradoc would almost sooner have died than disgrace a horse .</p>
   <p>Or was it some glimmering perception of the old Greek saying — ‘ Character is Fate ; ’ some sudden sense of the universal truth that all are in bond to their own natures , and what a man has most desired shall in the end enslave him ?</p>
   <p>And then , of all the awful feelings man or woman can know , she experienced the worst : She could not cry !</p>
   <p>“ A man who gives advice , ” he said at last , “ is always something of a fool . ”</p>
   <p>And in queer , cheery-looking apathy — not far removed perhaps from despair — he sat , watching the leaves turn over and fall .</p>
   <p>“ That 's the trouble . He suffers from swollen principles — only wish he could keep them out of his speeches . ”</p>

   <p>Nothing , however , is more dubious than the way in which these two words “ pessimist ” and “ optimist ” are used ; for the optimist appears to be he who cannot bear the world as it is , and is forced by his nature to picture it as it ought to be , and the pessimist one who cannot only bear the world as it is , but loves it well enough to draw it faithfully .</p>
