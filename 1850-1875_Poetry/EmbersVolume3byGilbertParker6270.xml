       <l n="10">His footsteps hast thou covered with thy flood ?</l>
       <l n="11">He was as one who lifteth up the yoke ,</l>

       <l n="23">The sakkia turneth no more ; the oxen they are gone ;</l>
       <l n="24">The young go forth in chains , the old waken in the night ,</l>

       <l n="38">Out in the desert did we bury our gold ,</l>

       <l n="41">To save our young men , to keep them from the chains .</l>
       <l n="42">God hath swallowed his voice , or the sea hath drowned it ,</l>
       <l n="43">Or the Nile hath covered him with its flood ;</l>
       <l n="44">Else would he come when our voices call .</l>

       <l n="27">I would rather ride in those pleasant grounds ,</l>
       <l n="28">Than to sit ‘ neath the spell of the voice</l>
       <l n="29">Of the sweetest seraph that you could find</l>
       <l n="30">In all the celestial place ;</l>
       <l n="31">And I hope that the Father , whose heart is kind ,</l>
       <l n="32">When I speak to Him face to face ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">Will give me something to do up there</l>
       <l n="34">Among all the folks that have died ,</l>
       <l n="35">That will give me freedom and change of air ,</l>
       <l n="36">If it 's only to boundary ride :</l>
       <l n="37">For I somehow think , in the Great Stampede ,</l>
       <l n="38">When the world crowds up to the Bar ,</l>
       <l n="39">The unluckiest mortals will be decreed</l>
       <l n="40">To camp on the luckiest star .</l>

      <head>THE BRIDGE OF THE HUNDRED SPANS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It was the time that the Long Divide</l>
       <l n="2">Blooms and glows like an hour-old bride ;</l>
       <l n="3">It was the days when the cattle come</l>
       <l n="4">Back from their winter wand'rings home ;</l>
       <l n="5">Time when the Kicking Horse shows its teeth ,</l>
       <l n="6">Snarls and foams with a demon 's breath ;</l>
       <l n="7">When the sun with a million levers lifts</l>
       <l n="8">Abodes of snow from the rocky rifts ;</l>
       <l n="9">When the line-man 's eyes , like the lynx 's , scans</l>
       <l n="10">The lofty Bridge of the Hundred Spans .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">Round a curve , down a sharp incline ,</l>
       <l n="12">If the red-eyed lantern made no sign ,</l>
       <l n="13">Swept the train , and upon the bridge</l>
       <l n="14">That binds a canon from ridge to ridge .</l>
       <l n="15">Never a watchman like old Carew ;</l>
       <l n="16">Knew his duty , and did it , too ;</l>
       <l n="17">Good at scouting when scouting paid ,</l>
       <l n="18">Saved a post from an Indian raid —</l>
       <l n="19">Trapper , miner , and mountain guide ,</l>
       <l n="20">Less one arm in a lumber slide ;</l>
       <l n="21">Walked the line like a panther 's guard ,</l>
       <l n="22">Like a maverick penned in a branding-yard .</l>
       <l n="23">“ Right as rain , ” said the engineers ,</l>

       <l n="25">“ Safe with Carew on the mountain wall , ”</l>
       <l n="26">Was how they put it , in Montreal .</l>
       <l n="27">Right and safe was it East and West</l>
       <l n="28">Till a demon rose on the mountain crest ,</l>
       <l n="29">And drove at its shoulders angry spears ,</l>
       <l n="30">That it rose from its sleep of a thousand years ,</l>
       <l n="31">That its heaving breast broke free the cords</l>
       <l n="32">Of imprisoned snow as with flaming swords ;</l>
       <l n="33">And , like a star from its frozen height ,</l>
       <l n="34">An avalanche leaped one spring-tide night ;</l>
       <l n="35">Leaped with a power not God 's or man 's</l>
       <l n="36">To smite the Bridge of the Hundred Spans .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="37">It smote a score of the spans ; it slew</l>
       <l n="38">With its icy squadrons old Carew .</l>
       <l n="39">Asleep he lay in his snow-bound grave ,</l>
       <l n="40">While the train drew on that he could not save ;</l>
       <l n="41">It would drop , doom-deep , through the trap of death ,</l>
       <l n="42">From the light above , to the dark beneath ;</l>
       <l n="43">And town and village both far and near</l>
       <l n="44">Would mourn the tragedy ended here .</l>

       <l n="45">One more hap in a hapless world ,</l>

       <l n="47">One more heap in a waste of sand ,</l>
       <l n="48">One more clasp of a palsied hand ,</l>
       <l n="49">One more cry to a soundless Word ,</l>
       <l n="50">One more flight of a wingless bird ;</l>
       <l n="51">The ceaseless falling , the countless groan ,</l>
       <l n="52">The waft of a leaf and the fall of a stone ;</l>
       <l n="53">Ever the cry that a Hand will save ,</l>
       <l n="54">Ever the end in a fast-closed grave ;</l>
       <l n="55">Ever and ever the useless prayer ,</l>

       <l n="59">Write not “ Lost , ” with its grinding bans ,</l>
       <l n="60">On life , or the Bridge of the Hundred Spans .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="61">See , on the canon 's western ridge ,</l>
       <l n="62">There stands a girl ! She beholds the bridge</l>
       <l n="63">Smitten and broken ; she sees the need</l>
       <l n="64">For a warning swift , and a daring deed .</l>
       <l n="65">See then the act of a simple girl ;</l>
       <l n="66">Learn from it , thinker , and priest , and churl .</l>
       <l n="67">See her , the lantern between her teeth ,</l>
       <l n="68">Crossing the quivering trap of death .</l>
       <l n="69">Hand over hand on a swaying rail ,</l>
       <l n="70">Sharp in her ears and her heart the wail</l>
       <l n="71">Of a hundred lives ; and she has no fear</l>
       <l n="72">Save that her prayer be not granted her .</l>
       <l n="73">Cold is the snow on the rail , and chill</l>
       <l n="74">The wind that comes from the frozen hill .</l>
       <l n="75">Her hair blows free and her eyes are full</l>
       <l n="76">Of the look that makes Heaven merciful —</l>
       <l n="77">Merciful , ah ! quick , shut your eyes ,</l>
       <l n="78">Lest you wish to see how a brave girl dies !</l>
       <l n="79">Dies — not yet ; for her firm hands clasped</l>
       <l n="80">The solid bridge , as the breach out-gasped ,</l>
       <l n="81">And the rail that had held her downward swept ,</l>
       <l n="82">Where old Carew in his snow-grave slept .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="83">Now up and over the steep incline ,</l>
       <l n="84">She speeds with the red light for a sign ;</l>
       <l n="85">She hears the cry of the coming train ,</l>
       <l n="86">it trembles like lanceheads through her brain ;</l>
       <l n="87">And round the curve , with a foot as fleet</l>
       <l n="88">As a sinner 's that flees from the Judgment-seat ,</l>
       <l n="89">She flies ; and the signal swings , and then</l>
       <l n="90">She knows no more ; but the enginemen</l>
       <l n="91">Lifted her , bore her , where women brought</l>
       <l n="92">The flush to her cheek , and with kisses caught</l>
       <l n="93">The warm breath back to her pallid lips ,</l>
       <l n="94">The life from lives that were near eclipse ;</l>
       <l n="95">Blessed her , and praised her , and begged her name</l>
       <l n="96">That all of their kindred should know her fame ;</l>
       <l n="97">Should tell how a girl from a cattle-ranche</l>
       <l n="98">That night defeated an avalanche .</l>
       <l n="99">Where is the wonder the engineer</l>
       <l n="100">Of the train she saved , in half a year</l>
       <l n="101">Had wooed her and won her ? And here they are</l>
       <l n="102">For their homeward trip in a parlour car !</l>
       <l n="103">Which goes to show that Old Nature 's plans</l>
       <l n="104">Were wrecked with the Bridge of the Hundred Spans .</l>

       <l n="1">Rebel ? . . . I grant you ,— my comrades then</l>
       <l n="2">Were called Old Pascal Dubois ’ Men</l>
       <l n="3">Half-breeds all of us . . . I , a scamp ,</l>
       <l n="4">The best long-shot in the Touchwood Camp ;</l>
       <l n="5">Muscle and nerve like strings of steel ,</l>
       <l n="6">Sound in the game of bit and heel —</l>
       <l n="7">There 's your guide-book . . . . But , Jeanne Amray ,</l>
       <l n="8">Telegraph-clerk at Sturgeon Bay ,</l>
       <l n="9">French and thoroughbred , proud and sweet ,</l>
       <l n="10">Sunshine down to her glancing feet ,</l>
       <l n="11">Sang one song ‘ neath the northern moon</l>
       <l n="12">That changed God 's world to a tropic noon ;</l>
       <l n="13">And Love burned up on its golden floor</l>
       <l n="14">Years of passion for Nell Latore —</l>
       <l n="15">Nell Latore with her tawny hair ,</l>
       <l n="16">Glowing eyes and her reckless air ;</l>
       <l n="17">Lithe as an alder , straight and tall —</l>
       <l n="18">Pride and sorrow of Rise-and-Fall !</l>
       <l n="19">Indian blood in her veins ran wild ,</l>
       <l n="20">And a Saxon father called her child ;</l>
       <l n="21">Women feared her , and men soon found</l>
       <l n="22">When they trod on forbidden ground .</l>
       <l n="23">Ride ! there 's never a cayuse knew</l>
       <l n="24">Saddle slip of her ; pistols , too ,</l>
       <l n="25">Seemed to learn in her hands a knack</l>
       <l n="26">How to travel a dead-sure track .</l>
       <l n="27">Something in both alike maybe ,</l>
       <l n="28">Something kindred in ancestry ,</l>
       <l n="29">Some warm touch of an ancient pride</l>
       <l n="30">Drew my feet to her willing side .</l>
       <l n="31">My comrade , she , in the Touchwood Camp ,</l>
       <l n="32">To ride , hunt , trail by the fire-fly lamp ;</l>
       <l n="33">To track the moose to his moose-yard ; pass</l>
       <l n="34">The bustard 's doom through the prairie grass ;</l>
       <l n="35">To hark at night to the crying loon</l>
       <l n="36">Beat idle wings on the still lagoon ;</l>
       <l n="37">To hide from death in the drifting snow ,</l>
       <l n="38">To slay the last of the buffalo . . . .</l>
       <l n="39">Ah , well , I speak of the days that were ;</l>
       <l n="40">And I swear to you , I was kind to her .</l>
       <l n="41">I lost her . How are the best friends lost ?</l>
       <l n="42">The lightning lines of our souls got crossed —</l>
       <l n="43">Crossed , and could never again be free</l>
       <l n="44">Till Death should call from his midnight sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="45">One spring brought me my wedding day ,</l>
       <l n="46">Brought me my bright-eyed Jeanne Amray ;</l>
       <l n="47">Brought that night to our cabin door</l>
       <l n="48">My old , lost comrade , Nell Latore .</l>
       <l n="49">Her eyes swam fire , and her cheek was red ,</l>
       <l n="50">Her full breast heaved as she darkly said :</l>
       <l n="51">“ The coyote hides from the wind and rain ,</l>
       <l n="52">The wild horse flies from the hurricane ,</l>
       <l n="53">But who can flee from the half-breed 's hate ,</l>
       <l n="54">That rises soon and that watches late ? ”</l>
       <l n="55">Then went ; and I laughed Jeanne 's fears afar ,</l>
       <l n="56">But I thought that wench was our evil star .</l>
       <l n="57">Be sure , when a woman 's heart gets hard ,</l>
       <l n="58">It works up war like a navy yard .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="59">Half-breed and Indian troubles came —</l>
       <l n="60">The same old story — land and game ;</l>
       <l n="61">And Dubois ’ Men were the first to feel</l>
       <l n="62">The bullet-sting and the clip of steel ;</l>
       <l n="63">And last in battle ‘ gainst thousands sent ,</l>
       <l n="64">With Gatling guns for our punishment .</l>
       <l n="65">Every cause has its traitor ; then</l>
       <l n="66">How should it fare with Dubois ’ Men !</l>
       <l n="67">Beaten their cause was , and hunted down ,</l>
       <l n="68">Like to a moose in the chase full blown ,</l>
       <l n="69">Panting they stood ; and a Judas sold</l>
       <l n="70">Their hiding-place for a piece of gold .</l>
       <l n="71">And while scouts searched for us night and day</l>
       <l n="72">Jeanne telegraphed on at Sturgeon Bay .</l>
       <l n="73">Picture her there as she stands alone ,</l>
       <l n="74">Cold , in the glow of the afternoon ;</l>
       <l n="75">Picture , I ask you , that patient wife ,</l>
       <l n="76">Numb with fear for her husband 's life ,</l>
       <l n="77">When a sharp click-click awakes her brain</l>
       <l n="78">To life , with the needle-points of pain .</l>
       <l n="79">A message it was to Camp Pousette —</l>
       <l n="80">One that the half-breeds think on yet :</l>
       <l n="81">“ Dubois ’ gang are in Rocky Glen ,</l>
       <l n="82">Take a hundred and fifty men ;</l>
       <l n="83">Go by the next express , ” it said ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="85">“ Go by the next express ! ” and she ,</l>
       <l n="86">Standing there by the silent key ,</l>
       <l n="87">Said it over and over again ,</l>
       <l n="88">Thinking of one of Dubois ’ Men</l>
       <l n="89">Thinking in anguish , heart and head ,</l>
       <l n="90">Of him , brought up there alive or dead .</l>
       <l n="91">Save him , and perish to save him , yes !</l>
       <l n="92">But three hours more , and that next express</l>
       <l n="93">Would thunder by her , and she , alas !</l>
       <l n="94">Must stand there still and let it pass .</l>
       <l n="95">Duty was duty , and hers was clear ;</l>
       <l n="96">God seemed far off , and no friend near .</l>
       <l n="97">But the truest friend and the swiftest horse</l>
       <l n="98">Must ride that ride on a breakneck course ;</l>
       <l n="99">And with truest horse and swiftest friend ,</l>
       <l n="100">To the fast express was the winning end !</l>
       <l n="101">And as if one pang was needed more ,</l>
       <l n="102">There stood in the doorway , Nell Latore —</l>
       <l n="103">Nell Latore , with her mocking face ,</l>
       <l n="104">Restless eyes , and her evil grace ;</l>
       <l n="105">Quick to read in the wife 's sad eyes ,</l>
       <l n="106">The deep , strange woe , and the hurt surprise .</l>
       <l n="107">Slow she said , with piercing breath ,</l>
       <l n="108">“ Rebel fighter dies rebel death ! ”</l>
       <l n="109">Said , and paused ; for she seemed to see</l>
       <l n="110">Far through the other 's misery ,</l>
       <l n="111">Something that stilled her ; triumph fled</l>
       <l n="112">Shamed and fast , as the young wife said —</l>
       <l n="113">“ He keeps his faith with an oath he swore ,</l>
       <l n="114">For the half-breed 's freedom , Nell Latore ;</l>
       <l n="115">And , did he lie here , eyes death-dim ,</l>
       <l n="116">You , if you spoke but truth of him ,</l>
       <l n="117">Truth , truth only , should stand and say ,</l>
       <l n="118">‘ He never wronged me , Jeanne Amray . ’ ”</l>
       <l n="119">Then , for a moment , standing there ,</l>
       <l n="120">Hushed and cold as a dead man 's prayer ,</l>
       <l n="121">Nell Latore , with the woman now ,</l>
       <l n="122">Scorching the past from her eyes and brow</l>
       <l n="123">“ Trust me , ” she said , like an angel-call ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="125">Quick resolve to a quick-told tale —</l>
       <l n="126">Nell Latore , to the glistening rail</l>
       <l n="127">Fled , and on it a hand-car drew ,</l>
       <l n="128">Seized the handles , and backward threw</l>
       <l n="129">One swift , farewell look , and said ,</l>
       <l n="130">“ You shall have him alive , not dead ! ”</l>
       <l n="131">Ah , well for her that her arms were strong ,</l>
       <l n="132">And cord and nerve like a knotted thong ,</l>
       <l n="133">And well for Jeanne in her sharp distress ,</l>
       <l n="134">That Nell was racing the fast express</l>
       <l n="135">Her whole life bent to this one deed ,</l>
       <l n="136">And , like a soul from its prison freed ,</l>

       <l n="138">Hills of conquest from plains of loss .</l>
       <l n="139">Gorges echoed as she passed by ,</l>
       <l n="140">Wild fowl rose with a plaintive cry ;</l>

       <l n="143">Once , a lad at a worn-out mine</l>

       <l n="157">Knew , as they stood by the pine-girt store ,</l>
       <l n="158">The girl that had foiled them — Nell Latore .</l>
       <l n="159">Slow she moved from among them , turned</l>
       <l n="160">Where the sky to the westward burned ;</l>
       <l n="161">Gazed for a moment , set her hands</l>
       <l n="162">Over her brow , so ! drew the strands</l>
       <l n="163">Loose and rich of her tawny hair ,</l>
       <l n="164">Once through her fingers , standing there ;</l>
       <l n="165">Then again to the rail she passed .</l>
       <l n="166">One more look to the West she cast ,</l>
       <l n="167">And into the East she drew away :</l>
       <l n="168">Backwards and forwards her brown arms play ,</l>
       <l n="169">Forwards and backwards , till far and dim ,</l>
       <l n="170">She grew one with the night 's dun rim ;</l>
       <l n="171">Backwards and forwards , and then , was gone</l>
       <l n="172">Into I know not what . . . alone .</l>
       <l n="173">She came not back , she may never come ;</l>
       <l n="174">But a young wife lives in a cabin home ,</l>
       <l n="175">Who prays each night that , alive or dead ,</l>
       <l n="176">Come God 's own rest for her lonely head :</l>
       <l n="177">And I — shall I see her then no more ,</l>
       <l n="178">My comrade , my old love , Nell Latore ?</l>
