    <docTitle><titlePart>THE BOOK OF GOOD COUNSELS SELECTED FROM THE HITOPADEŚA [ Translated from the Sanscrit by Sir Edwin Arnold ] TRANSLATOR 'S PREFACE A story-book from the Sanscrit at least possesses the minor merit of novelty . The “ perfect language ” has been hitherto regarded as the province of scholars , and few of these even have found time or taste to search its treasures . And yet among them is the key to the heart of modern India — as well as the splendid record of her ancient Gods and glories . The hope of Hindostan lies in the intelligent interest of England . Whatever avails to dissipate misconceptions between them , and to enlarge their intimacy , is a gain to both peoples ; and to this end the present volume aspires , in an humble degree , to contribute .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The “ Hitopadeśa ” is a work of high antiquity , and extended popularity . The prose is doubtless as old as our own era ; but the intercalated verses and proverbs compose a selection from writings of an age extremely remote . The “ Mahabharata ” and the textual Veds are of those quoted ; to the first of which Professor M. Williams ( in his admirable edition of the “ Nala , ”<date>1860</date>) assigns a date of 350 B. C ., while he claims for the “ Rig-Veda ” an antiquity as high as B. C .<date>1300</date>. The “ Hitopadeśa ” may thus be fairly styled “ The Father of all Fables ” ; for from its numerous translations have come Æsop and Pilpay , and in later days Reineke Fuchs . Originally compiled in Sanscrit , it was rendered , by order of Nushiraván , in the sixth century , A. D ., into Persic . From the Persic it passed , A. D. 850 , into the Arabic , and thence into Hebrew and Greek . In its own land it obtained as wide a circulation . The Emperor Acbar , impressed with the wisdom of its maxims and the ingenuity of its apologues , commended the work of translating it to his own Vizir , Abdul Fazel . That minister accordingly put the book into a familiar style , and published it with explanations , under the title of the “ Criterion of Wisdom . ” The Emperor had also suggested the abridgment of the long series of shlokes which here and there interrupt the narrative , and the Vizir found this advice sound , and followed it , like the present Translator . To this day , in India , the “ Hitopadeśa , ” under other names ( as the “ Anvári Suhaili "[ 1 ]) , retains the delighted attention of young and old , and has some representative in all the Indian vernaculars . A work so well esteemed in the East cannot be unwelcome to Western readers , who receive it here , a condensed but faithful transcript of sense and manner . As often as an Oriental allusion , or a name in Hindoo mythology , seemed to ask some explanation for the English reader , notes have been appended , bearing reference to the page . In their compilation , and generally , acknowledgment is due to Professor Johnson 's excellent version and edition of the “ Hitopadeśa , ” and to Mr. Muir 's “ Sanscrit Texts . ” A residence in India , and close intercourse with the Hindoos , have given the author a lively desire to subserve their advancement . No one listens now to the precipitate ignorance which would set aside as “ heathenish ” the high civilization of this great race ; but justice is not yet done to their past development and present capacities . If the wit , the morality , and the philosophy of these “ beasts of India ” ( so faithfully rendered by Mr. Harrison Weir ) surprise any vigorous mind into further exploration of her literature , and deeper sense of our responsibility in her government , the author will be repaid .

    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">HONOR TO GUNESH , GOD OF WISDOM</p>
    <p n="2">This book of Counsel read , and you shall see , Fair speech and Sanscrit lore , and Policy .</p>
    <p n="3">ON the banks of the holy river Ganges there stood a city named Pataliputra . The King of it was a good King and a virtuous , and his name was Sudarsana . It chanced one day that he overheard a certain person reciting these verses —</p>
    <p n="4">“ Wise men , holding wisdom highest , scorn delights , as false as fair , Daily live they as Death 's fingers twined already in their hair .</p>
    <p n="5">Truly , richer than all riches , better than the best of gain , Wisdom is , unbought , secure — once won , none loseth her again .</p>
    <p n="6">Bringing dark things into daylight , solving doubts that vex the mind , Like an open eye is Wisdom — he that hath her not is blind . ”</p>
    <p n="7">Hearing these the King became disquieted , knowing that his own sons were gaining no wisdom , nor reading the Sacred Writings ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>but altogether going in the wrong way ; and he repeated this verse to himself —</p>
    <p n="8">“ Childless art thou ? dead thy children ? leaving thee to want and dool ? Less thy misery than his is , who is father to a fool . ”</p>
    <p n="9">And again this —</p>
    <p n="10">“ One wise son makes glad his father , forty fools avail him not :— One moon silvers all that darkness which the silly stars did dot . ”</p>
    <p n="11">“ And it has been said , ” reflected he —</p>
    <p n="12">“ Ease and health , obeisant children , wisdom , and a fair-voiced wife — Thus , great King ! are counted up the five felicities of life . For the son the sire is honored ; though the bow-cane bendeth true , Let the strained string crack in using , and what service shall it do ? ”</p>
    <p n="13">“ Nevertheless , ” mused the King , “ I know it is urged that human efforts are useless : as , for instance —</p>
    <p n="14">“ That which will not be , will not be — and what is to be , will be :— Why not drink this easy physic , antidote of misery ? ”</p>
    <p n="15">“ But then that comes from idleness , with people who will not do what they should do . Rather ,</p>
    <p n="16">“ Nay ! and faint not , idly sighing , ‘ Destiny is mightiest , ’ Sesamum holds oil in plenty , but it yieldeth none unpressed . Ah ! it is the Coward 's babble , ‘ Fortune taketh , Fortune gave ; ’ Fortune ! rate her like a master , and she serves thee like a slave . ”</p>
    <p n="17">“ For indeed ,</p>
    <p n="18">“ Twofold is the life we live in — Fate and Will together run :— Two wheels bear life 's chariot onward — will it move on only one ? ”</p>
    <p n="19">“ And</p>
    <p n="20">“ Look ! the clay dries into iron , but the potter moulds the clay :— Destiny to-day is master — Man was master yesterday . ”</p>
    <p n="21">“ So verily ,</p>
    <p n="22">“ Worthy ends come not by wishing . Wouldst thou ? Up , and win it , then ! While the hungry lion slumbers , not a deer comes to his den . ”</p>
    <p n="23">Having concluded his reflections , the Raja gave orders to assemble a meeting of learned men . Then said he —</p>
    <p n="24">“ Hear now , O my Pundits ! Is there one among you so wise that he will undertake to give the second birth of Wisdom to these my sons , by teaching them the Books of Policy ; for they have never yet read the Sacred Writings , and are altogether going in the wrong road ; and ye know that</p>
    <p n="25">“ Silly glass , in splendid settings , something of the gold may gain ; And in company of wise ones , fools to wisdom may attain . ”</p>
    <p n="26">Then uprose a great Sage , by name Vishnu-Sarman , learned in the principles of Policy as is the angel of the planet Jupiter himself , and he said —</p>
    <p n="27">“ My Lord King , I will undertake to teach these princes Policy , seeing they are born of a great house ; for —</p>
    <p n="28">“ Labors spent on the unworthy , of reward the laborer balk ; Like the parrot , teach the heron twenty times , he will not talk . ”</p>
    <p n="29">“ But in this royal family the offspring are royal-minded , and in six moons I will engage to make your Majesty 's sons comprehend Policy . ”</p>
    <p n="30">The Raja replied , with condescension :—</p>
    <p n="31">“ On the eastern mountains lying , common things shine in the sun , And by learned minds enlightened , lower minds may show as one . ”</p>
    <p n="32">“ And you , worshipful sir , are competent to teach my children the rules of Policy . ”</p>
    <p n="33">So saying , with much graciousness , he gave the Princes into the charge of Vishnu-Sarman ; and that sage , by way of introduction , spake to the Princes , as they sat at ease on the balcony of the palace , in this wise :—</p>
    <p n="34">“ Hear now , my Princes ! for the delectation of your Highnesses , I purpose to tell the tale of the Crow , the Tortoise , the Deer , and the Mouse . ”</p>
    <p n="35">“ Pray , sir , ” said the King 's sons , “ let us hear it . ”</p>
    <p n="36">Vishnu-Sarman answered —</p>
    <p n="37">“ It begins with the Winning of Friends ; and this is the first verse of it :—</p>
    <p n="38">“ Sans way or wealth , wise friends their purpose gain — The Mouse , Crow , Deer , and Tortoise make this plain . ”</p>
    <p n="39"><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The Vedas are the holy books of India . They are four in number : The Rig-Veda , Yajur-Veda , Sama-Veda , and Atharva-Veda .</p>

     <l n="3">The Mouse , Crow , Deer , and Tortoise make this plain . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ However was that ? ” asked the Princes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">Vishnu-Sarman replied :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ On the banks of the Godavery there stood a large silk-cotton-tree , and thither at night , from all quarters and regions , the birds came to roost . Now once , when the night was just spent , and his Radiance the Moon , Lover of the white lotus , was about to retire behind the western hills , a Crow who perched there , ‘ Light o ’ Leap ’ by name , upon awakening , saw to his great wonder a fowler approaching — a second God of Death . The sight set him reflecting , as he flew off uneasily to follow up the man 's movements , and he began to think what mischief this ill-omened apparition foretold .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ For a thousand thoughts of sorrow , and a hundred things of dread ,</l>
     <l n="2">By the wise unheeded , trouble day by day the foolish head . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And yet in this life it must be that</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ Of the day 's impending dangers , Sickness , Death , and Misery ,</l>
     <l n="5">One will be ; the wise man waking , ponders which that one will be . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Presently the fowler fixed a net , scattered grains of rice about , and withdrew to hide . At this moment “ Speckle-neck , ” King of the Pigeons , chanced to be passing through the sky with his Court , and caught sight of the rice-grains . Thereupon the King of the Pigeons asked of his rice-loving followers , ‘ How can there possibly be rice-grains lying here in an unfrequented forest ? We will see into it , of course , but We like not the look of it — love of rice may ruin us , as the Traveller was ruined .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ All out of longing for a golden bangle ,</l>
     <l n="2">The Tiger , in the mud , the man did mangle . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ How did that happen ? ” asked the Pigeons .</l>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE TIGER AND THE TRAVELLER</head>
    <head>“ Thus , ” replied Speckle-neck : “ I was pecking about one day in the Deccan forest , and saw an old tiger sitting newly bathed on the bank of a pool , like a Brahman , and with holy kuskus-grass<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>in his paws .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Ho ! ho ! ye travellers , ’ he kept calling out , ‘ take this golden bangle ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Presently a covetous fellow passed by and heard him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="3">‘ Ah ! ’ thought he , ‘ this is a bit of luck — but I must not risk my neck</l>
     <l n="4">for it either .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">“ Good things come not out of bad things ; wisely leave a longed-for ill .</l>
     <l n="6">Nectar being mixed with poison serves no purpose but to kill . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="7">‘ But all gain is got by risk , so I will see into it at least ; ’ then he</l>
     <l n="8">called out , ‘ Where is thy bangle ? ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="9">The Tiger stretched forth his paw and exhibited it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="10">‘ Hem ! ’ said the Traveller , ‘ can I trust such a fierce brute as thou</l>
     <l n="11">art ? ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Listen , ’ replied the Tiger , ‘ once , in the days of my cub-hood , I know I was very wicked . I killed cows , Brahmans , and men without number — and I lost my wife and children for it — and have n't kith or kin left . But lately I met a virtuous man who counselled me to practise the duty of almsgiving — and , as thou seest , I am strict at ablutions and alms . Besides , I am old , and my nails and fangs are gone — so who would mistrust me ? and I have so far conquered selfishness , that I keep the golden bangle for whoso comes . Thou seemest poor ! I will give it thee . Is it not said ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Give to poor men , son of Kûnti — on the wealthy waste not wealth ;</l>
     <l n="2">Good are simples for the sick man , good for nought to him in health . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">‘ Wade over the pool , therefore , and take the bangle , ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Thereupon the covetous Traveller determined to trust him , and waded into the pool , where he soon found himself plunged in mud , and unable to move .</p>
   <p>‘ Ho ! ho ! ’ says the Tiger , ‘ art thou stuck in a slough ? stay , I will fetch thee out ! ’</p>
   <p>So saying he approached the wretched man and seized him — who meanwhile bitterly reflected —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Be his Scripture-learning wondrous , yet the cheat will be a cheat ;</l>
     <l n="2">Be her pasture ne'er so bitter , yet the cow 's milk will be sweet . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And on that verse , too —</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Trust not water , trust not weapons ; trust not clawed nor horned things ; Neither give thy soul to women , nor thy life to Sons of Kings . ’</p>

This done , and the pigeons extricated , the King of the Mice<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>gave them his formal welcome . “ But , your Majesty , ” he said , “ this capture in the net was a work of destiny ; you must not blame yourself as you did , and suspect a former fault .

  <p>THE STORY OF THE JACKAL , DEER , AND CROW</p>
   <p>“ Far away in Behar there is a forest called Champak-Grove ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>and in it had long lived in much affection a Deer and a Crow . The Deer , roaming unrestrained , happy and fat of carcase , was one day descried by a Jackal . ‘ Ho ! ho ! ’ thought the Jackal on observing him , ‘ if I could but get this soft meat for a meal ! It might be — if I can only win his confidence , ’ Thus reflecting he approached , and saluted him .</p>
   <p>‘ Health be to thee , friend Deer ! ’</p>
   <p>‘ Who art thou ? ’ said the Deer .</p>
   <p>‘ I 'm Small-wit , the Jackal , ’ replied the other . ‘ I live in the wood here , as the dead do , without a friend ; but now that I have met with such a friend as thou , I feel as if I were beginning life again with plenty of relations . Consider me your faithful servant . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Very well , ’ said the Deer ; and then , as the glorious King of Day , whose diadem is the light , had withdrawn himself , the two went together to the residence of the Deer . In that same spot , on a branch of Champak , dwelt the Crow Sharp-sense , an old friend of the Deer . Seeing them approach together , the Crow said ,</p>

  <p>THE STORY OF THE VULTURE , THE CAT , AND THE BIRDS</p>
   <p>“ On the banks of the Ganges there is a cliff called Vulture-Crag , and thereupon grew a great fig-tree . It was hollow , and within its shelter lived an old Vulture , named Grey-pate , whose hard fortune it was to have lost both eyes and talons . The birds that roosted in the tree made subscriptions from their own store , out of sheer pity for the poor fellow , and by that means he managed to live . One day , when the old birds were gone , Long-ear , the Cat , came there to get a meal of the nestlings ; and they , alarmed at perceiving him , set up a chirruping that roused Grey-pate .</p>
   <p>‘ Who comes there ? ’ croaked Grey-pate .</p>
   <p>“ Now Long-ear , on espying the Vulture , thought himself undone ; but as flight was impossible , he resolved to trust his destiny and approach .</p>
   <p>‘ My lord , ’ said he , ‘ I have the honor to salute thee . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Who is it ? ’ said the Vulture .</p>
   <p>‘ I am a Cat , ’</p>
   <p>‘ Be off , Cat , or I shall slay thee , ’ said the Vulture .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ I am ready to die if I deserve death , ’ answered the Cat ; ‘ but let what</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">‘ Wherefore , then , comest thou ? ’ said the Vulture .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ I live , ’ began Long-ear , ‘ on the Ganges , bathing , and eating no flesh , practising the moon-penance ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>like a Bramacharya . The birds that resort thither constantly praise your worship to me as one wholly given to the study of morality , and worthy of all trust ; and so I came here to learn law from thee , Sir , who art so deep gone in learning and in years . Dost thou , then , so read the law of strangers as to be ready to slay a guest ? What say the books about the householder ?—</p>

     <l n="18">“ To these weighty words Grey-pate answered ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="19">‘ Yes ! but cats like meat , and there are young birds here , and therefore</l>
     <l n="20">I said , go , ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Sir , ’ said the Cat ( and as he spoke he touched the ground , and then his two ears , and called on Krishna to witness to his words ) , ‘ I that have overcome passion , and practised the moon-penance , know the Scriptures ; and howsoever they contend , in this primal duty of abstaining from injury they are unanimous . Which of them sayeth not —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ He who does and thinks no wrong —</l>

   </lg>
   <p>“ And so , winning the old Vulture 's confidence , Long-ear , the Cat , entered the hollow tree and lived there . And day after day he stole away some of the nestlings , and brought them down to the hollow to devour . Meantime the parent birds , whose little ones were being eaten , made an inquiry after them in all quarters ; and the Cat , discovering this fact , slipped out from the hollow , and made his escape . Afterwards , when the birds came to look closely , they found the bones of their young ones in the hollow of the tree where Grey-pate lived ; and the birds at once concluded that their nestlings had been killed and eaten by the old Vulture , whom they accordingly executed . That is my story , and why I warned you against unknown acquaintances . ”</p>
   <p>“ Sir , ” said the Jackal , with some warmth , “ on the first day of your encountering the Deer you also were of unknown family and character : how is it , then , that your friendship with him grows daily greater ? True , I am only Small-wit , the Jackal , but what says the saw ?—</p>

   <p>“ Very good , ” said Sharp-sense ; “ as you will ; ” and in the morning each started early for his own feeding-ground ( returning at night ) . One day the Jackal drew the Deer aside , and whispered , ‘ Deer , in one corner of this wood there is a field full of sweet young wheat ; come and let me show you . ’ The Deer accompanied him , and found the field , and afterwards went every day there to eat the green corn , till at last the owner of the ground spied him and set a snare . The Deer came again very shortly , and was caught in it , and ( after vainly struggling ) exclaimed , ‘ I am fast in the net , and it will be a net of death to me if no friend comes to rescue me ! ’ Presently Small-wit , the Jackal , who had been lurking near , made his appearance , and standing still , he said to himself , with a chuckle , ‘ O ho ! my scheme bears fruit ! When he is cut up , his bones , and gristle , and blood , will fall to my share and make me some beautiful dinners , ’ The Deer , here catching sight of him , exclaimed with rapture , ‘ Ah , friend , this is excellent !

   <p>When he was gone , the Crow , who had missed the Deer upon returning that evening , and had sought for him everywhere , discovered him ; and seeing his sad plight , exclaimed —</p>

I will make a show of pecking thine eyes out with my beak ; and whensoever I utter a croak , then spring to thy feet and betake thee to flight . ’</p>
   <p>The Deer thereon placed himself exactly as the Crow suggested , and was very soon espied by the husbandman , whose eyes opened with joy at the sight .</p>
   <p>‘ Aha ! ’ said he , ‘ the fellow has died of himself , ’ and so speaking , he released the Deer from the snare , and proceeded to gather and lay aside his nets .

   <p>“ Good sir , ” said the King of the Mice , “ your conversation is as pleasing as pearl necklets or oil of sandal-wood in hot weather .

   <p>“ In the Nerbudda woods , by Camphor-water , ” replied the Crow . “ There is an old and valued friend of mine lives there — Slow-toes his name is , a very virtuous Tortoise ; he will regale me with fish and good things . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why should I stay behind , ” said Golden-skin , “ if thou goest ? Take me also . ”</p>
   <p>Accordingly , the two set forth together , enjoying charming converse upon the road . Slow-toes perceived Light o ’ Leap a long way off , and hastened to do him the guest-rites , extending them to the Mouse upon Light o ’ Leap 's introduction .</p>
   <p>“ Good Slow-toes , ” said he , “ this is Golden-skin , King of the Mice — pay all honor to him — he is burdened with virtues — a very jewel-mine of kindnesses . I do n't know if the Prince of all the Serpents , with his two thousand tongues , could rightly repeat them . ” So speaking , he told the story of Speckle-neck . Thereupon Slow-toes made a profound obeisance to Golden-skin , and said , “ How came your Majesty , may I ask , to retire to an unfrequented forest ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I will tell you , ” said the King . “ You must know that in the town of Champaka there is a college for the devotees . Unto this resorted daily a beggar-priest , named Chudakarna , whose custom was to place his begging-dish upon the shelf , with such alms in it as he had not eaten , and go to sleep by it ; and I , so soon as he slept , used to jump up , and devour the meal . One day a great friend of his , named Vinakarna , also a mendicant , came to visit him ; and observed that while conversing , he kept striking the ground with a split cane , to frighten me . ‘ Why do n't you listen ? ’ said Vinakarna . ‘ I am listening ! ’ replied the other ; ‘ but this plaguy mouse is always eating the meal out of my begging-dish , ’ Vinakarna looked at the shelf and remarked , ‘ However can a mouse jump as high as this ? There must be a reason , though there seems none . I guess the cause — the fellow is well off and fat , ’ With these words Vinakarna snatched up a shovel , discovered my retreat , and took away all my hoard of provisions . After that I lost strength daily , had scarcely energy enough to get my dinner , and , in fact , crept about so wretchedly , that when Chudakarna saw me he fell to quoting —</p>

   <p>Yet , after all these reflections , I was covetous enough to make one more attempt on Chudakarna 's meal , and got a blow from the split cane for my pains . ‘ Just so , ’ I said to myself , ‘ the soul and organs of the discontented want keeping in subjection .

  <p>THE STORY OF THE DEAD GAME AND THE JACKAL</p>
   <p>“ In a town called ‘ Well-to-Dwell ’ there lived a mighty hunter , whose name was ‘ Grim-face , ’ Feeling a desire one day for a little venison , he took his bow , and went into the woods ; where he soon killed a deer . As he was carrying the deer home , he came upon a wild boar of prodigious proportions . Laying the deer upon the earth , he fixed and discharged an arrow and struck the boar , which instantly rushed upon him with a roar louder than the last thunder , and ripped the hunter up . He fell like a tree cut by the axe , and lay dead along with the boar , and a snake also , which had been crushed by the feet of the combatants . Not long afterwards , there came that way , in his prowl for food , a Jackal , named ‘ Howl o ’ Nights , ’ and cast eyes on the hunter , the deer , the boar , and the snake lying dead together . ‘ Aha ! ’ said he , ‘ what luck ! Here 's a grand dinner got ready for me ! Good fortune can come , I see , as well as ill fortune . Let me think :— the man will be fine pickings for a month ; the deer with the boar will last two more ; the snake will do for to-morrow ; and , as I am very particularly hungry , I will treat myself now to this bit of meat on the bow-horn , ’ So saying , he began to gnaw it asunder , and the bow-string slipping , the bow sprang back , and resolved Howl o ’ Nights into the five elements by death . That is my story , ” continued Slow-toes , “ and its application is for the wise :—</p>

   <p>Hearing the wisdom of these monitions , Light o ’ Leap broke out , ‘ Good Slow-toes ! thou art a wise protector of those that come to thee ; thy learning comforts my enlightened friend , as elephants drag elephants from the mire , ’ And thus , on the best of terms , wandering where they pleased for food , the three lived there together .</p>
   <p>One day it chanced that a Deer named Dapple-back , who had seen some cause of alarm in the forest , came suddenly upon the three in his flight .

Thence he looked all round to a great distance , but could discover nothing . So they all came back again , and sat down together . Slow-toes welcomed the Deer .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Good Deer , ’ said he , ‘ may grass and water never fail thee at thy need .</l>

   <p>‘ Then the thing is settled , ’ observed Golden-skin .</p>
   <p>‘ Yes ! yes ! ’ said Light o ’ Leap , ‘ make yourself altogether at home ! ’</p>

   </lg>
   <p>‘ I have heard , ’ replied Dapple-back , ‘ that the Prince of the Kalinga country , Rukmangada , is coming here . He is even now encamped on the Cheenab River , on his march to subjugate the borders ; and the hunters have been heard to say that he will halt to-morrow by this very lake of “ Camphor-water . ” Do n't you think , as it is dangerous to stay , that we ought to resolve on something ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ I shall certainly go to another pool , ’ exclaimed Slow-toes .</p>
   <p>‘ It would be better , ’ answered the Crow and Deer together .</p>
   <p>‘ Yes ! ’ remarked the King of the Mice , after a minute 's thought ; ‘ but how is Slow-toes to get across the country in time ? Animals like our amphibious host are best in the water ; on land he might suffer from his own design , like the merchant 's son —</p>

    <head>THE PRINCE AND THE WIFE OF THE MERCHANT 'S SON</head>
    <head>“ In the country of Kanouj there was a King named Virasena , and he made his son viceroy of a city called Virapoora . The Prince was rich , handsome , and in the bloom of youth . Passing through the streets of his city one day , he observed a very lovely woman , whose name was Lávanyavati — i. e ., the Beautiful — the wife of a merchant 's son . On reaching his palace , full of her charms and of passionate admiration for them , he despatched a message to her , and a letter , by a female attendant :— who wonders at it ?—</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Ah ! the gleaming , glancing arrows of a lovely woman 's eye !</l>
     <l n="2">Feathered with her jetty lashes , perilous they pass us by :—</l>

   <p>Now Lávanyavati , from the moment she saw the Prince , was hit with the same weapon of love that wounded him ; but upon hearing the message of the attendant , she refused with dignity to receive his letter .</p>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE OLD JACKAL AND THE ELEPHANT</head>
    <head>“ In the forest of Brahma<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>lived an Elephant , whose name was ‘ White-front . ’ The Jackals knew him , and said among themselves , ‘ If this great brute would but die , there would be four months ’ food for us , and plenty , out of his carcase . ’ With that an old Jackal stood up , and pledged himself to compass the death of the Elephant by his own wit . Accordingly , he sought for ‘ White-front , ’ and , going up to him , he made the reverential prostration of the eight members , gravely saluting him .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Divine creature , ’ said he , ‘ vouchsafe me the regard of one look . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">‘ Who art thou ? ’ grunted the Elephant ,' and whence comest thou ? ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ I am only a Jackal , ’ said the other ; ‘ but the beasts of the forest are convinced that it is not expedient to live without a king , and they have met in full council , and despatched me to acquaint your Royal Highness that on you , endowed with so many lordly qualities , their choice has fallen for a sovereign over the forest here ; for —</p>
   <p>‘ Who is just , and strong , and wise ? Who is true to social ties ? He is formed for Emperies .</p>
   <p>Let your Majesty , therefore , repair thither at once , that the moment of fortunate conjunction may not escape us . ’ So saying he led the way , followed at a great pace by White-front , who was eager to commence his reign .</p>
   <p>“ Presently the Jackal brought him upon a deep slough , into which he plunged heavily before he could stop himself .</p>
   <p>‘ Good master Jackal , ’ cried the Elephant ,' what 's to do now ? I am up to my belly in this quagmire . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Perhaps your Majesty , ’ said the Jackal , with an impudent laugh , ‘ will condescend to take hold of the tip of my brush with your trunk , and so get out . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Then White-front , the Elephant , knew that he had been deceived ; and thus he sank in the slime , and was devoured by the Jackals . Hence , ’ continued the attendant , ‘ is why I suggested stratagem to your Highness , ’</p>
   <p>Shortly afterwards , by the Slave 's advice , the Prince sent for the merchant 's son ( whose name was Charudatta ) , and appointed him to be near his person ; and one day , with the same design , when he was just come from the bath , and had on his jewels , he summoned Charudatta , and said —</p>
   <p>“ I have a vow to keep to Gauri — bring hither to me every evening for a month some lady of good family , that I may do honor to her , according to my vow ; and begin to-day . ”</p>
   <p>Charudatta in due course brought a lady of quality , and , having introduced her , retired to watch the interview . The Prince , without even approaching his fair visitor , made her the most respectful obeisances , and dismissed her with gifts of ornaments , sandal-wood , and perfumes , under the protection of a guard . This made Charudatta confident , and longing to get some of these princely presents he brought his own wife next evening . When the Prince recognized the charming Lávanyavati — the joy of his soul — he sprang to meet her , and kissed and caressed her without the least restraint . At sight of this the miserable Charudatta stood transfixed with despair — the very picture of wretchedness ’ ——</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ And you too , Slow-toes — but where is he gone ? ’ abruptly asked King</l>
     <l n="2">Golden-skin .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Now Slow-toes had not chosen to wait the end of the story , but was gone before , and Golden-skin and the others followed him up in some anxiety . The Tortoise had been painfully travelling along , until a hunter , who was beating the wood for game , had overtaken him . The fellow , who was very hungry , picked him up , fastened him on his bow-stick , and set off for home ; while the Deer , the Crow , and the Mouse , who had witnessed the capture , followed them in terrible concern . ‘ Alas ! ’ cried the Mouse-king , ‘ he is gone !— and such a friend !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Friend ! gracious word !— the heart to tell is ill able</l>
     <l n="2">Whence came to men this jewel of a syllable . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">‘ Let us , ’ continued he to his companions , ‘ let us make one attempt , at</l>
     <l n="4">least , to rescue Slow-toes before the hunter is out of the wood ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">‘ Only tell us how to do it , ’ replied they .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Do thus , ’ said Golden-skin : ‘ let Dapple-back hasten on to the water , and lie down there and make himself appear dead ; and do you , Light o ’ Leap , hover over him and peck about his body . The hunter is sure to put the Tortoise down to get the venison , and I will gnaw his bonds . ’</p>
   <p>‘ The Deer and the Crow started at once ; and the hunter , who was sitting down to rest under a tree and drinking water , soon caught sight of the Deer , apparently dead . Drawing his wood-knife , and putting the Tortoise down by the water , he hastened to secure the Deer , and Golden-skin , in the meantime , gnawed asunder the string that held Slow-toes , who instantly dropped into the pool . The Deer , of course , when the hunter got near , sprang up and made off , and when he returned to the tree the Tortoise was gone also . “ I deserve this , ” thought he —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Whoso for greater quits his gain ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shall have his labor for his pain ;</l>
     <l n="3">The things unwon unwon remain ,</l>
     <l n="4">And what was won is lost again . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And so lamenting , he went to his village . Slow-toes and his friends , quit of all fears , repaired together to their new habitations , and there lived happily .</p>
   <p>Then spake the King Sudarsana 's sons , “ We have heard every word , and are delighted ; it fell out just as we wished . ”</p>
   <p>“ I rejoice thereat , my Princes , ” said Vishnu-Sarman ; “ may it also fall out according to this my wish —</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Moved by these reflections Well-to-do loaded a cart with wares of all kinds , yoked two bulls to it , named Lusty-life and Roarer , and started for Kashmir to trade . He had not gone far upon his journey when in passing through a great forest called Bramble-wood , Lusty-life slipped down and broke his foreleg . At sight of this disaster Well-to-do fell a-thinking , and repeated —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Men their cunning schemes may spin —</l>
     <l n="2">God knows who shall lose or win . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Comforting himself with such philosophy , Well-to-do left Lusty-life there , and went on his way . The Bull watched him depart , and stood mournfully on three legs , alone in the forest . ‘ Well , well , ’ he thought , ‘ it is all destiny whether I live or die :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Shoot a hundred shafts , the quarry lives and flies — not due to death ;</l>
     <l n="2">When his hour is come , a grass-blade hath a point to stop his breath . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As the days passed by , and Lusty-life picked about in the tender forest grass , he grew wonderfully well , and fat of carcase , and happy , and bellowed about the wood as though it were his own . Now , the reigning monarch of the forest was King Tawny-hide the Lion , who ruled over the whole country absolutely , by right of having deposed everybody else . Is not might right ?—</p>
   <p>‘ Robes were none , nor oil of unction , when the King of Beasts was crowned :— ‘ Twas his own fierce roar proclaimed him , rolling all his kingdom round . ’</p>
   <p>One morning , his Majesty , being exceedingly thirsty , had repaired to the bank of the Jumna to drink water , and just as he was about to lap it , the bellow of Lusty-life , awful as the thunder of the last day , reached the imperial ears . Upon catching the sound the King retreated in trepidation to his own lair , without drinking a drop , and stood there in silence and alarm revolving what it could mean . In this position he was observed by the sons of his minister , two jackals named Karataka and Damanaka , who began to remark upon it .</p>
   <p>‘ Friend Karataka , ’ said the last ,' what makes our royal master slink away from the river when he was dying to drink ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ Why should we care ? ’ replied Karataka . ‘ It 's bad enough to serve him , and be neglected for our pains —</p>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE MONKEY AND THE WEDGE</head>
    <head>“ In South Behar , close by the retreat of Dhurmma , there was an open plot of ground , upon which a temple was in course of erection , under the management of a man of the Káyeth caste , named Subhadatta . A carpenter upon the works had partly sawed through a long beam of wood , and wedged it open , and was gone away , leaving the wedge fixed . Shortly afterwards a large herd of monkeys came frolicking that way , and one of their number , directed doubtless by the Angel of death , got astride the beam , and grasped the wedge , with his tail and lower parts dangling down between the pieces of the wood . Not content with this , in the mischief natural to monkeys , he began to tug at the wedge ; till at last it yielded to a great effort and came out ; when the wood closed upon him , and jammed him all fast . So perished the monkey , miserably crushed ; and I say again —</head>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE STORY OF THE WASHERMAN 'S JACKASS</head>
    <head>“ There was a certain Washerman at Benares , whose name was Carpúrapataka , and he had an Ass and a Dog in his courtyard ; the first tethered , and the last roaming loose . Once on a time , when he had been spending his morning in the society of his wife , whom he had just married , and had fallen to sleep in her arms , a robber entered the house , and began to carry off his goods . The Ass observed the occupation of the thief , and was much concerned .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Good Dog , ’ said he , ‘ this is thy matter : why dost thou not bark aloud ,</l>
     <l n="2">and rouse the master ? ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Gossip Ass , ’ replied the Dog , ‘ leave me alone to guard the premises . I can do it , if I choose ; but the truth is , this master of ours thinks himself so safe lately that he clean forgets me , and I do n't find my allowance of food nearly regular enough . Masters will do so ; and a little fright will put him in mind of his defenders again . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Thou scurvy cur ! ’ exclaimed the Ass —</p>
   <p>‘ At the work-time , asking wages — is it like a faithful herd ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ Thou extreme Ass ! ’ replied the Dog .</p>
   <p>‘ When the work 's done , grudging wages — is that acting like a lord ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ Mean-spirited beast , ’ retorted the Ass , ‘ who neglectest thy master 's business ! Well , then , I at least will endeavor to arouse him ; it is no less than religion ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Serve the Sun with sweat of body ; starve thy maw to feed the flame ;</l>
     <l n="2">Stead thy lord with all thy service ; to thy death go , quit of blame . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So saying , he put forth his very best braying . The Washerman sprang up at the noise , and missing the thief , turned in a rage upon the Ass for disturbing him , and beat it with a cudgel to such an extent that the blows resolved the poor animal into the five elements of death . ‘ So that , ’ continued Karataka , ‘ is why I say , Let the prime minister look to him . The hunting for prey is our duty — let us stick to it , then . And this , ’ he said , with a meditative look , ‘ need not trouble us to-day ; for we have a capital dish of the royal leavings . ’</p>
   <p>‘ What ! ’ said Damanaka , rough with rage , ‘ dost thou serve the King for the sake of thy belly ? Why take any such trouble to preserve an existence like thine ?—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Many prayers for him are uttered whereon many a life relies ;</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Tis but one poor fool the fewer when the gulping Raven dies . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For assisting friends , and defeating enemies also , the service of kings is desirable . To enter upon it for a mere living makes the thing low indeed . There must be dogs and elephants ; but servants need not be like hungry curs , while their masters are noble . What say the books ?</p>

   <p>‘ Good Jackal , ’ said Tawny-hide , ‘ I am horribly frightened about it . ’</p>

   <p>THE STORY OF THE CAT WHO SERVED THE LION</p>
   <p>“ Far away in the North , on a mountain named ‘ Thousand-Crags , ’ there lived a lion called ‘ Mighty-heart ’ ; and he was much annoyed by a certain mouse , who made a custom of nibbling his mane while he lay asleep in his den . The Lion would wake in a great rage at finding the ends of his magnificent mane made ragged , but the little mouse ran into his hole , and he could never catch it . After much consideration he went down to a village , and got a Cat named Curd-ear to come to his cave with much persuasion . He kept the Cat royally on all kinds of dainties , and slept comfortably without having his mane nibbled , as the mouse would now never venture out . Whenever the Lion heard the mouse scratching about , that was always a signal for regaling the Cat in a most distinguished style . But one day , the wretched mouse being nearly starved , he took courage to creep timidly from his hole , and was directly pounced upon by Curd-ear and killed . After that the Lion heard no more of the mouse , and quite left off his regular entertainments of the Cat . No ! ” concluded Damanaka , “ we will keep our mouse alive for his Majesty . ”</p>
   <p>So conversing , the Jackals went away to find Lusty-life the Bull , and upon discovering him , Karataka squatted down with great dignity at the foot of a tree , while Damanaka approached to accost him .</p>
   <p>‘ Bull , ’ said Damanaka , ‘ I am the warder of this forest under the King Tawny-hide , and Karataka the Jackal there is his General . The General bids thee come before him , or else instantly depart from the wood . It were better for thee to obey , for his anger is terrible , ’</p>
   <p>‘ Thereupon Lusty-life , knowing nothing of the country customs , advanced at once to Karataka , made the respectful prostration of the eight members , and said timidly , ‘ My Lord General ! what dost thou bid me do ?—</p>
   <p>‘ Strength serves Reason . Saith the Mahout , when he beats the brazen drum , “ Ho ! ye elephants , to this work must your mightinesses come . " ’</p>
   <p>‘ Bull , ’ answered Karataka , ‘ thou canst remain in the wood no longer unless thou goest directly to lay thyself at our Royal master 's imperial feet . ’</p>
   <p>‘ My Lord , ’ replied the Bull , ‘ give me a guarantee of safety , and I will go . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Bull , ’ said Karataka , ‘ thou art foolish ; fear nothing —</p>

   <p>‘ So the Jackals , keeping Lusty-life in the rear , went towards the palace of King Tawny-hide ; where the Rajah received them with much graciousness , and bade them sit down .</p>
   <p>‘ Have you seen him ? ’ asked the King .</p>
   <p>‘ We have seen him , your Majesty , ’ answered Damanaka ; ‘ it is quite as your Majesty expected — the creature has enormous strength , and wishes to see your Majesty . Will you be seated , Sire , and prepare yourself — it will never do to appear alarmed at a noise . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Oh , if it was only a noise , ’ began the Rajah .</p>
   <p>‘ Ah , but the cause , Sire ! that was what had to be found out ; like the secret of Swing-ear the Spirit . ’</p>
   <p>‘ And who might Swing-ear be ? ’ asked the King .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE STORY OF THE TERRIBLE BELL</head>
    <head>“ A goblin , your Majesty , ” responded Damanaka , “ it seemed so , at least , to the good people of Brahmapoora . A thief had stolen a bell from the city , and was making off with that plunder , and more , into the Sri-parvata hills , when he was killed by a tiger . The bell lay in the jungle till some monkeys picked it up , and amused themselves by constantly ringing it . The townspeople found the bones of the man , and heard the noise of the bell all about the hills ; so they gave out that there was a terrible devil there , whose ears rang like bells as he swung them about , and whose delight was to devour men . Every one , accordingly , was leaving the town , when a peasant woman named Karála , who liked belief the better for a little proof , came to the Rajah .</head>

   <p>“ Karála , who had her own ideas upon the matter , took the present and set out . Being come to the hills , she made a circle , and did homage to Gunputtee ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>without whom nothing prospers . Then , taking some fruit she had brought , such as monkeys love extremely , she scattered it up and down in the wood , and withdrew to watch . Very soon the monkeys finding the fruit , put down the bell , to do justice to it , and the woman picking it up , bore it back to the town , where she became an object of uncommon veneration . We , indeed , ” concluded Damanaka , “ bring you a Bull instead of a bell — your Majesty shall now see him ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Thereupon Lusty-life was introduced , and , the interview passing off well , he remained many days in the forest on excellent terms with the Lion .</p>
   <p>‘ One day another Lion , named ‘ Stiff-ears , ’ the brother of King Tawny-hide , came to visit him . The King received him with all imaginable respect , bade him be seated , and rose from his throne to go and kill some beasts for his refreshment .</p>
   <p>‘ May it please your Majesty , ’ interposed the Bull , ‘ a deer was slain to-day — where is its flesh ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ Damanaka and his brother know best , ’ said the King .</p>
   <p>‘ Let us ascertain if there be any , ’ suggested the Bull .</p>

   <p>THE STORY OF THE PRINCE AND THE PROCURESS</p>
   <p>“ In the city of ‘ Golden-Streets ’ there reigned a valorous King , named Vira-vikrama , whose officer of justice was one day taking away to punishment a certain Barber , when he was stopped by a strolling mendicant , who held him by the skirts , and cried out , ‘ Punish not this man — punish them that do wrong of their own knowledge . ’ Being asked his meaning , he recited the foregoing verses , and , being still further questioned , he told this story —</p>
   <p>“ I am Prince Kandarpa-ketu , son of the King of Ceylon . Walking one day in my summer-garden , I heard a merchant-captain narrating how that out at sea , deep under water , on the fourteenth day of the moon , he had seen what was like nothing but the famous tree of Paradise , and sitting under it a lady of most lustrous beauty , bedecked with strings of pearls like Lukshmi herself , reclining , with a lute in her hands , on what appeared to be a golden couch crusted all over with precious stones . At once I engaged the captain and his ship , and steered to the spot of which he told me . On reaching it I beheld the beautiful apparition as he had described it , and , transported with the exquisite beauty of the lady , I leapt after her into the sea . In a moment I found myself in a city of gold ; and in an apartment of a golden palace , surrounded by young and beautiful girls , I found the Sea-queen . She perceived my approach , and sent an attendant with a courteous message to meet me . In reply to my questions , I learned that the lady was the Princess Ratnamanjari , daughter of the King of All the Spirits — and how she had made a vow that whoever should first come to see her golden city , with his own eyes , should marry her . So I married her by the form called Gundharva , or ‘ Union by mutual consent , ’ and spent many and happy days in her delightful society . One day she took me aside , and said , ‘ Dear Prince ! all these delights , and I myself , are thine to enjoy ; only that picture yonder , of the Fairy Streak-o ’ - Gold , that thou must never touch ! ’ For a long time I observed this injunction ; at last , impelled by resistless curiosity , I laid my hand on the picture of ‘ Streak-o ’ - Gold , ’ In one instant her little foot , lovely as the lotus-blossom , advanced from out of the painting , and launched me through sea and air into my own country . Since that I have been a miserable wanderer ; and passing through this city , I chanced to lodge at a Cowkeeper 's hut , and saw the truth of this Barber 's affair . The herdsman returned at night with his cattle , and found his wife talking with the wife of the Barber , who is no better than a bawd . Enraged at this , the man beat his wife , tied her to the milking-post , and fell asleep . In the dead of the night the Barber 's wife came back , and said to the woman , ‘ He , whom thou knowest , is burnt with the cruel fire of thine absence , and lies nigh to death ; go therefore and console him , and I will tie myself to the post until thou returnest . ’ This was done , and the Cowkeeper presently awoke . ‘ Ah ! thou light thing ! ’ he said jeeringly , ‘ why dost not thou keep promise , and meet thy gallant ? ’ The Barber 's wife could make no reply ; whereat becoming incensed , the man cried out , ‘ What ! dost thou scorn to speak to me ? I will cut thy nose off ! ’ And so he did , and then lay down to sleep again . Very soon the Cowkeeper 's wife came back and asked if ‘ all was well . ’ ‘ Look at my face ! ’ said the Barber 's wife , ‘ and you will see if all is well . ’ The woman could do nothing but take her place again , while the Barber 's wife , picking up the severed nose , and at a sad loss how to account for it , went to her house . In the morning , before it was light , the Barber called to her to bring his box of razors , and she bringing one only , he flung it away in a passion . ‘ Oh , the knave ! ’ she cried out , directly , aloud , ‘ Neighbors , neighbors ! he has cut my nose off ! ’ and so she took him before the officers . The Cowkeeper , meantime , wondering at his wife 's patience , made some inquiry about her nose ; whereto she replied , ‘ Cruel wretch ! thou canst not harm a virtuous woman . If Yama and the seven guardians of the world know me chaste , then be my face unmaimed ! ’ The herdsman hastened to fetch a light , and finding her features unaltered , he flung himself at her feet , and begged forgiveness . For ,</p>

     <l n="1">‘ Never tires the fire of burning , never wearies death of slaying ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nor the sea of drinking rivers , nor the bright-eyed of betraying , ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Thereupon the King 's officer dismissed Kandarpa-ketu , and did justice by setting the Barber free , shaving the head of the Barber 's wife , and punishing the Cowkeeper 's .</p>
   <p>‘ That is my story , ’ concluded Damanaka , ‘ and thence I said that we had no reason to complain . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Well , but we must do something , ’ said Karataka .</p>
   <p>‘ Yes ! How shall we break the friendship of the King with the Bull ? ’ asked the other .</p>

   <p>‘ But we can do it , ’ replied the other .</p>

   <p>THE STORY OF THE LION AND THE OLD HARE</p>
   <p>“ On the Mandara mountain there lived a Lion named Fierce-of-heart , and he was perpetually making massacre of all the wild animals . The thing grew so bad that the beasts held a public meeting , and drew up a respectful remonstrance to the Lion in these words :—</p>
   <p>“ Wherefore should your Majesty thus make carnage of us all ? If it may please you , we ourselves will daily furnish a beast for your Majesty 's meal . ” The Lion responded , “ If that arrangement is more agreeable to you , be it so . ” ; and from that time a beast was allotted to him daily , and daily devoured . One day it came to the turn of an old hare to supply the royal table , who reflected to himself as he walked along , “ I can but die , and I will go to my death leisurely . ”</p>
   <p>“ Now Fierce-of-heart , the lion , was pinched with hunger , and seeing the Hare so approaching he roared out , “ How darest thou thus delay in coming ? ”</p>
   <p>‘ Sire , ’ replied the Hare , ‘ I am not to blame . I was detained on the road by another lion , who exacted an oath from me to return when I should have informed your Majesty . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Go , ’ exclaimed King Fierce-of-heart in a rage ; ‘ show me , instantly , where this insolent villain of a lion lives . ’</p>
   <p>“ The Hare led the way accordingly till he came to a deep well , whereat he stopped , and said , ‘ Let my lord the King come hither and behold him . ’ The Lion approached , and beheld his own reflection in the water of the well , upon which , in his passion , he directly flung himself , and so perished . ”</p>
   <p>“ I have heard your story , ” said the Hen-Crow , “ but what plan do you propose ? ”</p>
   <p>“ My dear , ” replied her mate , “ the Rajah 's son comes here every day to bathe in the stream . When he takes off his gold anklet , and lays it on the stone , do thou bring it in thy beak to the hollow of the tree , and drop it in there . ” Shortly after the Prince came , as was his wont , and taking off his dress and ornaments , the Hen-Crow did as had been determined ; and while the servants of the Prince were searching in the hollow , there they found the Black Snake , which they at once dispatched .</p>
   <p>‘ Said I not well , ’ continued Damanaka , ‘ that stratagem excels force ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ It was well said , ’ replied Karataka ; ‘ go ! and may thy path be prosperous !</p>
   <p>‘ With that Damanaka repaired to the King , and having done homage , thus addressed him :—</p>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE WAGTAIL AND THE SEA</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ On the shore of the Southern Sea there dwelt a pair of Wagtails . The</l>
     <l n="2">Hen-bird was about to lay , and thus addressed her mate :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">‘ Husband , we must look about for a fit place to lay my eggs . ’</l>
    </lg>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">‘ This spot ! ’ exclaimed the Hen ; ‘ why , the tide overflows it . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="6">‘ Good dame , ’ said the Cock , ‘ am I so pitiful a fellow that the Sea will</l>
     <l n="7">venture to wash the eggs out of my nest ? ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="8">‘ You are my very good Lord , ’ replied the Hen , with a laugh ; ‘ but still</l>
     <l n="9">there is a great difference between you and the Sea . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Afterwards , however , at the desire of her mate , she consented to lay her eggs on the sea-beach . Now the Ocean had overheard all this , and , bent upon displaying its strength , it rose and washed away the nest and eggs . Overwhelmed with grief , the Hen-bird flew to her mate , and cried :—</p>
   <p>‘ Husband , the terrible disaster has occurred ! My eggs arc gone ! ’</p>
   <p>‘ Be of good heart ! my Life , ’ answered he .</p>
   <p>“ And therewith he called a meeting of fowls , and went with them into the presence of Gurud , the Lord of the birds . When the Master of the Mighty Wing had listened to their complaint , he conveyed it to the knowledge of the God Narayen , who keeps , and kills , and makes alive the world . The almighty mandate given , Gurud bound it upon his forehead , and bore it to the Ocean , which , so soon as it heard the will of Narayen , at once gave back the eggs .</p>
   <p>‘ How , indeed , ’ concluded Damanaka , ‘ should I judge of the Bull 's power , not knowing who supports him ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ By what signs , then , ’ asked the King , ‘ may I conclude him a traitor ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ If he comes into the presence with his horns lowered for goring , as one that expects the fight . That , ’ replied the Jackal , ‘ will convince your Majesty , ’</p>
   <p>‘ Thereupon Damanaka the Jackal withdrew , and betook himself towards the Bull , upon perceiving whom he approached slowly , with all the air of one greatly distressed .</p>
   <p>‘ Good master Jackal , ’ said Lusty-life , ‘ what goes amiss with thee ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ All goes amiss with such as serve wicked masters , ’ replied the Jackal .</p>
   <p>‘ But what ails thee ? ’ asked the Bull .</p>

   <p>‘ Bull , ’ began Damanaka , ‘ it is a King 's secret , and should not be spoken ; but thou didst come here upon my safeguard , and as I hope for the life to come , I will tell thee of what touches thee so nearly . Listen !— the heart of the King is turned against thee ! he hath sworn secretly that he will kill thee and feast upon thy flesh . ’</p>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE WEAVER-BIRDS AND THE MONKEYS</head>
    <head>“ In a nullah that leads down to the Nerbudda river there stood a large silk-cotton tree , where a colony of weaver-birds had built their hanging nests , and lived snugly in them , whatever the weather . It was in the rainy season , when the heavens are overlaid with clouds like indigo-sheets , and a tremendous storm of water was falling . The birds looked out from their nests , and saw some monkeys , shivering and starved with the cold , standing under a tree . ‘ Twit ! twit ! you Monkeys , ’ they began to chirrup . ‘ Listen to us !—</head>
     <l n="1">‘ With beaks we built these nests , of fibres scattered ;</l>
     <l n="2">You that have hands and feet , build , or be spattered . ’</l>

   <p>On hearing that the Monkeys were by no means pleased . ‘ Ho ! ho ! ’ said they , ‘ the Birds in their snug nests are jeering at us ; wait till the rain is over , ’ Accordingly , so soon as the weather mended , the Monkeys climbed into the tree , and broke all the birds ’ eggs and demolished every nest . I ought to have known better , ’ concluded the Crane , ‘ than to have wasted my suggestions on King Jewel-plume 's creatures . ’</p>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE OLD HARE AND THE ELEPHANTS</head>
    <head>“ Once on a time , very little rain had fallen in the due season ; and the Elephants being oppressed with thirst , thus accosted their leader :— ‘ Master , how are we to live ? The small creatures find something to wash in , but we cannot , and we are half dead in consequence ; whither shall we go then , and what shall we do ? ’ Upon that the King of the Elephants led them away a little space ; and showed them a beautiful pool of crystal water , where they took their ease . Now it chanced that a company of Hares resided on the banks of the pool , and the going and coming of the elephants trampled many of them to death , till one of their number named Hard-head grumbled out , ‘ This troop will be coming here to water every day , and every one of our family will be crushed . ’ ‘ Do not disquiet yourself , ’ said an old buck named Good-speed , ‘ I will contrive to avert it , ’ and so saying , he set off , bethinking himself on his way how he should approach and accost a herd of elephants ; for ,</head>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE HERON AND THE CROW</head>
    <head>‘ The high-road to Oogein is a very unshaded and sultry one ; but there stands upon it one large Peepul-tree , and therein a Crow and a Heron had their residence together . It was in the hot weather that a tired traveller passed that way , and , for the sake of the shade , he laid his bow and arrows down , and dropped asleep under the tree . Before long the shadow of the tree shifted , and left his face exposed to the glare ; which the Heron perceiving , like the kindly bird he was , perched on the Peepul-tree , and spread his wings out so as to cast a shadow on the traveller 's face . There the poor fellow , weary with his travel , continued to sleep soundly , and snored away comfortably with open mouth . The sight of his enjoyment was too much for the malevolent Crow , who , perching over him , dropped an unwelcome morsel into the sleeper 's mouth , and straightway flew off . The traveller , starting from his slumber , looked about , and , seeing no bird but the Heron , he fitted an arrow and shot him dead .

    <head>THE STORY OF THE APPEASED WHEELWRIGHT</head>
    <head>“ There was a Wheelwright in Shri-nuggur , whose name was ‘ Heavy-head , ’ He had good reason to suspect the infidelity of his wife , but he had no absolute proof of it . One day he gave out that he should go to a neighboring town , and he started accordingly ; but he went a very little way , and then returning , hid himself in his wife 's chamber . She being quite satisfied that he was really gone away , invited her gallant to pass the evening with her , and began to spend it with him in unrestrained freedom . Presently , by chance , she detected the presence of her husband , and her manner instantly changed .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Life of my soul ! what ails you ? ’ said her lover ; ‘ you are quite dull</l>
     <l n="2">to-night . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ I am dull , ’ she replied , ‘ because the lord of my life is gone . Without my husband the town is a wilderness . Who knows what may befall him , and whether he will have a nice supper ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ Trouble thyself no more about the quarrelsome dullard , ’ said her gallant .</p>
   <p>‘ Dullard , quotha ! ’ exclaimed the wife . ‘ What matter what he is , since he is my all ? Knowest thou not —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Of the wife the lord is jewel , though no gems upon her beam ;</l>
     <l n="2">Lacking him , she lacks adornment , howsoe'er her jewels gleam ? ’</l>

   <p>Thou , and the like of thee , may serve a whim , as we chew a betel-leaf and trifle with a flower ; but my husband is my master , and can do with me as he will . My life is wrapped up in him — and when he dies , alas ! I will certainly die too . Is it not plainly said —</p>

   <p>All this the Wheelwright heard . ‘ What a lucky fellow I am , ’ he thought , ‘ to have a wife so virtuous , ’ and rushing from his place of concealment , he exclaimed in ecstasy to his wife 's gallant , ‘ Sir I saw you ever truer wife than mine ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ When the story was concluded , ’ said Long-bill , ‘ the King , with a gracious gift of food , sent me off before the Parrot ; but he is coming after me , and it is now for your Majesty to determine as it shall please you . ’</p>

   <p>THE STORY OF THE DYED JACKAL</p>
   <p>“ A Jackal once on a time , as he was prowling about the suburbs of a town , slipped into an indigo-tank ; and not being able to get out he laid himself down so as to be taken for dead . The dyer presently coming and finding what seemed a dead Jackal , carried him into the jungle and then flung him away . Left to himself , the Jackal found his natural color changed to a splendid blue . ‘ Really , ’ he reflected , ‘ I am now of a most magnificent tint ; why should I not make it conduce to my elevation ? ’ With this view , he assembled the other Jackals , and thus harangued them :—</p>
   <p>‘ Good people , the Goddess of the Wood , with her own divine hand , and with every magical herb of the forest , has anointed me King . Behold the complexion of royalty !— and henceforward transact nothing without my imperial permission . ”</p>
   <p>“ The Jackals , overcome by so distinguished a color , could do nothing but prostrate themselves and promise obedience . His reign , thus begun , extended in time to the lions and tigers ; and with these high-born attendants he allowed himself to despise the Jackals , keeping his own kindred at a distance , as though ashamed of them . The Jackals were indignant , but an old beast of their number thus consoled them :—</p>
   <p>“ Leave the impudent fellow to me . I will contrive his ruin . These tigers and the rest think him a King , because he is colored blue ; we must show them his true colors . Do this , now !— in the evening-time come close about him , and set up a great yell together — he is sure to join in , as he used to do —</p>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Thereupon a Court was called , and the Parrot introduced , followed by Night-cloud , the Crow . A seat was offered to the parrot , who took it , and , with his beak in the air , thus delivered his mission :—</p>
   <p>‘ King Silver-sides !— My master , the King Jewel-plume , Lord of Lords , bids thee , if life and lands be dear to thee , to come and make homage at his august feet ; and failing this to get thee gone from Camphor-island . ’</p>
   <p>‘ S'death ! ’ exclaimed the Rajah , ‘ is there none that will silence this traitor ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ Give the sign , your Majesty , ’ said the Crow , starting up , ‘ and I will despatch this audacious bird . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Sir , ’ said the Goose , ‘ be calm ! and Sire , deign to listen —</p>
   <p>‘'Tis no Council where no Sage is — ‘ tis no Sage that fears not Law ; ‘ Tis no Law which Truth confirms not — ‘ tis no Truth which Fear can awe . ’</p>
   <p>An ambassador must speak unthreatened —</p>

   <p>Shortly afterwards the Spy returned to Camphor-island . ‘ King Silver-sides , ’ he cried , ‘ the Rajah , Jewel-plume , is on his way hither , and has reached the Ghauts . Let the fort be manned , for that Vulture is a great minister ; and I have learned , too , that there is one among us who is in his pay . ’</p>
   <p>‘ King ! ’ said the Goose , ‘ that must be the Crow . ’</p>
   <p>‘ But whence , then , did he show such willingness to punish the Parrot ? ’ objected his Majesty . ‘ Besides , war was declared long after the Crow came to Court . ’</p>
   <p>‘ I misdoubt him , ’ said the Minister , ‘ because he is a stranger . ’</p>
   <p>‘ But strangers surely may be well-disposed , ’ replied the King . ‘ How say the books ?—</p>
   <p>‘ Kind is kin , howe'er a stranger — kin unkind is stranger shown ; Sores hurt , though the body breeds them — drugs relieve , though desert-grown . ’</p>
   <p>Have you never heard of King Sudraka and the unknown Servant , who gave his son 's life for the King ?</p>
   <p>‘ Never , ’ answered the Goose .</p>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE FAITHFUL RAJPOOT</head>
    <head>“ I will tell you the tale , ” said the King , “ as I heard it from ‘ Lilyflower , ’ daughter of the Flamingo ‘ White-flag , ’ of whom I was once very fond :— A soldier presented himself one morning at King Sudraka 's gate , and bade the porter procure an audience for ‘ Vira-vara , a Rajpoot ,'[ 19 ] who sought employment . Being admitted to the presence , he thus addressed the King :—</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ If your Highness needs an attendant , behold one ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">‘ What pay do you ask ? ’ inquired the King .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="3">‘ Five hundred pieces of gold a day , ’ said Vira-vara .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="4">‘ And your accoutrements ? ’ asked the King .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="5">‘ Are these two arms , and this sabre , which serve for a third , ’ said</l>
     <l n="6">Vira-vara , rolling up his sleeve .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ I cannot entertain you , ’ rejoined his Majesty ; and thereupon the Rajpoot made salaam , and withdrew . Then said the Ministers , ‘ If it please your Majesty , the stipend is excessive , but give him pay for four days , and see wherein he may deserve it . ’ Accordingly , the Rajpoot was recalled , and received wages for four days , with the complimentary betel .— Ah ! the rare betel ! Truly say the wise of it —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Betel-nut is bitter , hot , sweet , spicy , binding , alkaline —</l>
     <l n="2">A demulcent — an astringent — foe to evils intestine ;</l>
     <l n="3">Giving to the breath a fragrance — to the lips a crimson red ;</l>
     <l n="4">A detergent , and a kindler of Love 's flame that lieth dead .</l>
     <l n="5">Praise the gods for the good Betel !— these be thirteen virtues given ,</l>
     <l n="6">Hard to meet in one thing blended , even in their happy heaven . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Now the King narrowly watched the spending of Vira-vara 's pay , and discovered that he bestowed half in the service of the Gods and the support of Brahmans , a fourth part in relieving the poor , and reserved a fourth for his sustenance and recreation . This daily division made , he would take his stand with his sabre at the gate of the palace ; retiring only upon receiving the royal permission .</p>
   <p>‘ It was on the fourteenth night of the dark half of the month that King Sudraka heard below a sound of passionate sobbing . ‘ Ho ! there , ’ he cried , ‘ who waits at the gate ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ I , ’ replied Vira-vara , ‘ may it please you . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Go and learn what means this weeping , ’ said the King .</p>
   <p>‘ I go , your Majesty , ’ answered the Rajpoot , and therewith departed .</p>
   <p>‘ No sooner was he gone than the King repented him of sending one man alone into a night so dark that a bodkin might pierce a hole in it , and girding on his scimitar , he followed his guard beyond the city gates . When Vira-vara had gone thus far he encountered a beautiful and splendidly dressed lady who was weeping bitterly ; and accosting her , he requested to know her name , and why she thus lamented .</p>
   <p>‘ I am the Fortune of the King Sudraka , ’ answered she ; ‘ a long while I have lived happily in the shadow of his arm ; but on the third day he will die , and I must depart , and therefore lament I . ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Can nothing serve , Divine Lady , to prolong thy stay ? ’ asked the</l>
     <l n="2">Rajpoot .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ It might be , ’ replied the Spirit , ‘ if thou shouldst cut off the head of thy first-born Shaktidhar , that hath on his body the thirty-two auspicious marks of greatness . Were his head offered to the all-helpful Durga , the Rajah should live a hundred years , and I might tarry beside him . ’</p>
   <p>‘ So speaking , she disappeared , and Vira-vara retraced his steps to his own house and awoke his wife and son . They arose , and listened with attention until Vira-vara had repeated all the words of the vision . When he had finished , Shaktidhar exclaimed , ‘ I am thrice happy to be able to save the state of the King . Kill me , my father , and linger not ; to give my life in such a cause is good indeed , ’ ‘ Yes , ’ said the Mother , ‘ it is good , and worthy of our blood ; how else should we deserve the King 's pay ? ’ Being thus agreed , they repaired together at once to the temple of the Goddess Durga , and having paid their devotions and entreated the favor of the deity on behalf of the King , Vira-vara struck off his son 's head , and laid it as an offering upon the shrine . That done , Vira-vara said , ‘ My service to the King is accomplished , and life without my boy is but a burden , ’ and therewith he plunged his sword in his own breast and fell dead . Overpowered with grief for her husband and child , the mother also withdrew the twice-blooded weapon , and slew herself with it on the bodies of Vira-vara and Shaktidhar .</p>
   <p>‘ All this was heard and seen by King Sudraka , and he stood aghast at the sad sight . ‘ Woe is me ! ’ he exclaimed —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Kings may come , and Kings may go ;</l>
     <l n="2">What was I , to bring these low ?</l>
     <l n="3">Souls so noble , slain for me ,</l>
     <l n="4">Were not , and will never be ! ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What reck I of my realm , having lost these ? ’ and thereat he drew his scimitar to take his own life also . At that moment there appeared to him the Goddess , who is Mistress of all men 's fortunes . ‘ Son , ’ said she , staying his lifted hand , ‘ forbear thy rash purpose , and bethink thee of thy kingdom . ’</p>
   <p>“ The Rajah fell prostrate before her , and cried — ‘ O Goddess ! I am done with life and wealth and kingdom ! If thou hast compassion on me , let my death restore these faithful ones to life ; anywise I follow the path they have marked , ’ ‘ Son , ’ replied the Goddess , ‘ thine affection is pleasing to me : be it as thou wilt ! The Rajpoot and his house shall be rendered alive to thee . ’ Then the King departed , and presently saw Vira-vara return , and take up again his station as before at the palace-gate .</p>
   <p>‘ Ho ! there , Vira-vara ! ’ cried the King , ‘ what meant the weeping ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ Let your Majesty rest well ! ’ answered the Rajpoot , ‘ it was a woman who wept , and disappeared on my approach . ’ This answer completed the Rajah 's astonishment and delight ; for we know —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ He is brave whose tongue is silent of the trophies of his sword ;</l>
     <l n="2">He is great whose quiet bearing marks his greatness well assured . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So when the day was come , he called a full council , and , declaring therein all the events of the night , he invested the faithful guard with the sovereignty of the Carnatic .</p>
   <p>“ Thus , then , ” concluded King Silver-sides , “ in entertaining strangers a man may add to his friends . ”</p>
   <p>“ It may well be , ” replied the Goose ; “ but a Minister should advise what is expedient , and not what is pleasing in sentiment :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ When the Priest , the Leech , the Vizir of a King his flatterers be ,</l>
     <l n="2">Very soon the King will part with health , and wealth , and piety . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Let it pass , then , ’ said Silver-sides , ‘ and turn we to the matter in hand . King Jewel-plume is even now pitched under the Ghauts . What think you ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ That we shall vanquish him , ’ replied the Goose ; ‘ for he disregards , as I learn , the counsel of that great statesman , the Vulture Far-sight ; and the wise have said —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Merciless , or money-loving , deaf to counsel , false of faith ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thoughtless , spiritless , or careless , changing course with every</l>
     <l n="3">breath ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or the man who scorns his rival — if a prince should choose a foe ,</l>
     <l n="5">Ripe for meeting and defeating , certes he would choose him so .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">He is marching without due preparation ; let us send the Paddy-bird at</l>
     <l n="7">the head of a force and attack him on his march . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Accordingly the Paddy-bird , setting out with a force of water-fowl , fell upon the host of the Peacock-king , and did immense execution . Disheartened thereat , King Jewel-plume summoned Far-sight , his Minister , and acknowledged to him his precipitation .</p>
   <p>‘ Wherefore do you abandon us , my father ? ’ he said . ‘ Correct for us what has been done amiss .</p>
   <p>‘ My Liege , ’ replied the Vulture , ‘ it has been well observed —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ By the valorous and unskilful great achievements are not wrought ;</l>
     <l n="2">Courage , led by careful Prudence , unto highest ends is brought . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">You have set Strength in the seat of Counsel , your Majesty , and he hath</l>
     <l n="4">clumsily spoiled your plans . How indeed could it fall otherwise ? for —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">‘ Grief kills gladness , winter summer , midnight-gloom the light of day ,</l>

     <l n="7">Each ends each , but none of other surer conquerors can be</l>
     <l n="8">Than Impolicy of Fortune — of Misfortune Policy . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I have said to myself , ‘ My Prince 's understanding is affected — how else would he obscure the moonlight of policy with the night-vapors of talk ; ’ in such a mood I cannot help him —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Wisdom answers all who ask her , but a fool she cannot aid ;</l>
     <l n="2">Blind men in the faithful mirror see not their reflection made . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And therefore I have been absent . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ My father ! ’ said the King , joining his palms in respect , ‘ mine is all the fault ! Pardon it , and instruct me how to withdraw my army without further loss . ’</p>
   <p>Then the Vulture 's anger melted , and he reflected —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Where the Gods are , or thy Guru — in the face of Pain and Age ,</l>
     <l n="2">Cattle , Brahmans , Kings , and Children — reverently curb thy rage . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And with a benignant smile , he answered the King thus , ‘ Be of good heart , my Liege ; thou shalt not only bring the host back safely , but thou shalt first destroy the castle of King Silver-sides . ’</p>
   <p>‘ How can that be , with my diminished forces ? ’ asked the Rajah .</p>
   <p>‘ It will come to pass ! ’ answered the Vulture . ‘ Break up to-day for the blockade of the fort . ’</p>
   <p>Now , when this was reported by the spies to King Silver-sides , he was greatly alarmed . ‘ Good Goose ! ’ said he , ‘ what is to be done ? Here is the King of the Peacocks at hand , to blockade us — by his Minister 's advice , too . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Sire , ’ replied the Goose , ‘ separate the efficient and the inefficient in your force ; and stimulate the loyalty of the first , with a royal bounty of gold and dresses , as each may seem to merit . Now is the time for it —</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Oh , my Prince ! on eight occasions prodigality is none —</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">

     <l n="8">‘ It is needed , my Liege , ’ said the Goose , ‘ and it befits a Monarch ;</l>

     <l n="10">‘ Truth , munificence , and valor , are the virtues of a King ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="12">‘ Let it be incurred then ! ’ replied the King .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>At this moment Night-cloud , the Crow , made his appearance . ‘ Deign me one regard , Sire , ’ said he , ‘ the insolent enemy is at our gates ; let your Majesty give the word , and I will go forth and show my valor and devotion to your Crown . ’</p>
   <p>‘ It were better to keep our cover , ’ said the Goose . ‘ Wherefore else builded we this fortalice ? Is it not said ?—</p>

     <l n="3">But go , your Majesty , and encourage our warriors . ” Thereupon they</l>
     <l n="4">repaired to the Gateway of the Fort , and all day the battle raged there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">It was the morning after , when King Jewel-plume spake thus to his</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">‘ It shall be kept , your Majesty , ’ replied the Vulture ; ‘ storm the fort ! ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ We will storm it ! ’ said the Peacock-king . The sun was not well-risen accordingly when the attack was made , and there arose hot fighting at all the four gates . It was then that the traitorous Crows , headed by their Monarch , Night-cloud , put fire to every dwelling in the citadel , and raised a shout of ‘ The Fort is taken ! it is taken ! ’ At this terrible sound the soldiers of the Swan-king forsook their posts , and plunged into the pool .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Not thus King Silver-sides :— retiring coolly before the foe , with his</l>
     <l n="2">General the Paddy-bird , he was cut off and encircled by the troopers of</l>
     <l n="3">King Jewel-plume , under the command of his Marshal , the Cock .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ My General , ’ said the King , ‘ thou shalt not perish for me . Fly ! I can go no farther . Fly ! I bid thee , and take counsel with the Goose that Crest-jewel , my son , be named King ! ’</p>
   <p>‘ Good my Lord , ’ replied the Paddy-bird , ‘ speak not thus ! Let your Majesty reign victorious while the sun and moon endure . I am governor of your Majesty 's fortress , and if the enemy enter it he shall but do so over my body ; let me die for thee , my Master !—</p>
   <p>‘ Gentle , generous , and discerning ; such a Prince the Gods do give ! ’</p>
   <p>‘ That shalt thou not , ’ replied the Rajah —</p>
   <p>‘ Skilful , honest , and true-hearted ; where doth such a Vassal live ? ’</p>
   <p>‘ Nay ! my royal Lord , escape ! ’ cried the Paddy-bird ; a king 's life is the life of his people —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ The people are the lotus-leaves , their monarch is the sun —</l>
     <l n="2">When he doth sink beneath the waves they vanish every one .</l>

     <l n="3">When he doth rise they rise again with bud and blossom rife ,</l>
     <l n="4">To bask awhile in his warm smile , who is their lord and life . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Think no more of me . ’ At this instant the Cock rushing forward , inflicted a wound with his sharp spurs on the person of the King ; but the Paddy-bird sprang in front of him , and receiving on his body the blows designed for the Rajah , forced him away into the pool . Then turning upon the Cock , he despatched him with a shower of blows from his long bill ; and finally succumbed , fighting in the midst of his enemies . Thus the King of the Peacocks captured the fortress ; and marched home with all the treasure in it , amid songs of victory .</p>
   <p>Then spake the Princes : “ In that army of the Swans there was no soldier like the Paddy-bird , who gave his own life for the King 's . ”</p>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE UNABASHED WIFE</head>
    <head>“ There was a trader in Vikrama-poora , who had a very beautiful wife , and her name was Jewel-bright . The lady was as unfaithful as she was fair , and had chosen for her last lover one of the household servants . Ah ! womankind !—</head>

   <p>Now it befell one day that as Jewel-bright was bestowing a kiss on the mouth of the servant , she was surprised by her husband ; and seeing him she ran up hastily and said , ‘ My lord , here is an impudent varlet ! he eats the camphor which I procured for you ; I was actually smelling it on his lips as you entered . ’ The servant catching her meaning , affected offence . ‘ How can a man stay in a house where the mistress is always smelling one 's lips for a little camphor ? ’ he said ; and thereat he was for going off , and was only constrained by the good man to stay , after much entreaty . ‘ Therefore , ’ said Quick-at-peril , ‘ I mean to abide here , and make the best I can of what befalls , as she did . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Yes , yes , ’ said What-will-be-will-be , ‘ we all know</p>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE HERONS AND THE MONGOOSE</head>
    <head>“ Among the mountains of the north there is one named Eagle-cliff , and near it , upon a fig-tree , a flock of Herons had their residence . At the foot of the tree , in a hollow , there lived a serpent ; and he was constantly devouring the nestlings of the Herons . Loud were the complaints of the parent birds , until an old Heron thus advised them :— ‘ You should bring some fishes from the pool , and lay them one by one in a line from the hole of yonder Mongoose to the hollow where the Serpent lives . The Mongoose will find him when it comes after the fish , and if it finds him it will kill him . ’ The advice seemed good , and was acted upon ; but in killing the Snake the Mongoose overheard the cry of the young Herons ; and climbing the tree daily , he devoured all that the Snake had left . Therefore , ’ concluded the Geese , ‘ do we bid you look well into your plan : if you should open your mouth , for instance , as we carry you , you will drop and be killed . ’</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Am I a fool , ’ cried the Tortoise , ‘ to open my mouth ? Not I ! Come now ,</l>

    <head>THE STORY OF THE RECLUSE AND THE MOUSE</head>
    <head>“ In the forest of the Sage Gautama there dwelt a Recluse named Mighty-at-Prayer . Once , as he sat at his frugal meal , a young mouse dropped beside him from the beak of a crow , and he took it up and fed it tenderly with rice grains . Some time after the Saint observed a cat pursuing his dependent to devour it , whereupon he changed the mouse into a stout cat . The cat was a great deal harassed by dogs , upon which the Saint again transformed it into a dog . The dog was always in danger of the tigers , and his protector at last gave him the form of a tiger — considering him all this while , and treating him withal , like nothing but a mouse . The country-folk passing by would say , ‘ That a tiger ! not he ; it is a mouse the Saint has transformed . ’ And the mouse being vexed at this , reflected , ‘ So long as the Master lives , this shameful story of my origin will survive ! ’ With this thought he was about to take the Saint 's life , when he , who knew his purpose , turned the ungrateful beast by a word to his original shape .

At the equinoctial feast of the Dussera , he obtained for his duxina-gift a dish of flour , which he took into a potter 's shed ; and there lay down in the shade among the pots , staff in hand . As he thus reclined he began to meditate , ‘ I can sell this meal for ten cowrie-shells , and with them I can purchase some of these pots and sell them at an advance . With all that money I shall invest in betel-nuts and body-cloths and make a new profit by their sale ; and so go on trafficking till I get a lakh of rupees — what 's to prevent me ? Then I shall marry four wives — and one at least will be beautiful and young , and she shall be my favorite . Of course the others will be jealous ; but if they quarrel , and talk , and trouble me I will belabor them like this — and this ’ — and therewith he flourished his staff to such a purpose as to smash his meal-dish and break several of the potter 's jars .

    <head>THE DUEL OF THE GIANTS</head>
    <head>“ Long ago , my Liege , there were two Daityas named Sunda and Upasunda , the which with penance and fasting worshipped that God who wears the moon for his forehead-jewel ; desiring to win his favor , and thereby the lordship of the Three Worlds . At last the God , propitiated by their devotion , spake thus unto them :—</head>
     <l n="1">‘ I grant a boon unto ye — choose what it shall be . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ And they , who would have asked dominion , were suddenly minded of Saraswati — who reigns over the hearts and thoughts of men — to seek a forbidden thing .</p>
   <p>‘ If , ’ said they , ‘ we have found favor , let the Divinity give us his own cherished Parvati , the Queen of Heaven ! ’</p>
   <p>‘ Terribly incensed was the God , but his word had passed , and the boon must be granted ; and Parvati the Divine was delivered up to them . Then those two world-breakers , sick at heart , sin-blinded , and afire with the glorious beauty of the Queen of Life — began to dispute , saying one to another : ‘ Mine is she ! mine is she ! ’ At the last they called for an umpire , and the God himself appeared before them as a venerable Brahman .</p>
   <p>‘ Master , ’ said they , ‘ tell us whose she is , for we both won her by our might . ’</p>

Presently he came up with the first of them , who addressed him thus : ‘ Master ! why do you carry that dog on your shoulder ? ’ ‘ Dog ! ’ said the Brahman , ‘ it is a goat for sacrifice ! ’ With that he went on a coss , and came to the second knave ; who called out — ‘ What doest thou with that dog , Master ? ’ The Brahman laid his goat upon the ground , looked it all over , took it up again upon his back , and walked on with his mind in a whirl ; for —</head>

   <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
   <p>The “ Mahâbhârata ” is the oldest epic in Sanscrit literature , and is sevenfold greater in bulk than the “ Iliad ” and “ Odyssey ” taken together . This remarkable poem contains almost all the history of ancient India , so far as it can be recovered , together with inexhaustible details of its political , social , and religious life — in fact , the antique Hindoo world stands epitomized in it . The Old Testament is not more interwoven with the Jewish race , nor the New Testament with the civilization of Christendom , nor even the Koran with the records and destinies of Islam , than is this great Sanscrit poem with the unchanging and teeming population of Hindostan . The stories , songs , and ballads , the genealogies , the nursery tales and religious discourses , the art , the learning , the philosophy , the creeds , the modes of thought , the very phrases and daily ideas of the Hindoo people are taken from this poem . Their children are named after its heroes ; so are their cities , streets , and even cattle . It is the spiritual life of the Hindoo people . It is personified , worshipped , and cited as being something divine . To read , or even to listen , is to the devout Hindoo sufficiently meritorious to bring prosperity to the fireside in this world , and happiness in the world to come .</p>
   <p>The western world has as yet only received the “ Mahâbhârata ” in fragments — mere specimens , bearing to those vast treasures of Sanscrit literature such small proportion as cabinet samples of ore have to the riches of a mine . Such knowledge as we have of the great Indian epics is largely due to Sir William Jones , and the host of translators who followed him .</p>
   <p>In its present shape the “ Mahâbhârata ” contains some two hundred thousand verses . The style is forcible , often terse and nervous : the action is well sustained , and the whole effect produced is that of a poem written in commemoration of actual conflict between members of rival clans who lived somewhere southeast of the Punjab . In portrayal of character the Hindoo poem somewhat resembles its Grecian counterpart — the “ Iliad ” ; the noble devotion and chivalric character of its chief hero , Arjuna , reminds us of Hector — and the wily , sinful Duryodhana , is a second Ulysses . The “ Mahâbhârata ” was probably begun in the third or fourth century B. C ., and completed soon after the beginning of the Christian era .</p>
   <p>The “ Bhârata ” war is a war between rival cousins of the house of Bhârata , a race of heroes mentioned in the Rig-veda collection . Duryodhana deprives his cousin Yudhisthira of his throne by inducing him to squander his fortune , kingdom , family , and self — and then banishes Yudhisthira and the latter 's four brothers for twelve years . The gambling was conducted in an unfair manner , and the cousins feel that their banishment was the result of treachery , although pretended to be mercy in lieu of death . When the twelve years are over they collect armies of sympathizers , and on the Sacred Plain of the Kurus ( the Holy Land of India ) the great war is fought out . The good prevails , Duryodhana is slain , and Yudhisthira recovers his kingdom . This story is told so graphically that the “ Mahâbhârata ” still has the charm that comes from plot and action , as well as that of poetic beauty .</p>
   <p>A concluding passage of this great poem says : “ The reading of this ‘ Mahâbhârata ’ destroys all sin and produces virtue , so much so that the pronunciation of a single shloka is sufficient to wipe away much guilt . It has bound human beings in a chain , of which one end is life and the other death . If a man reads the ‘ Mahâbhârata ’ and has faith in its doctrines , he is free from all sin and ascends to heaven after his death . ”</p>
   <p>The present selection is the episode of Nala and Damayanti . It is one of the most charming of the “ Mahâbhârata ” stories , and its Oriental flavor and delicacy have been well preserved by the translator , Sir Edwin Arnold .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">A prince there was , named Nala , Virasen 's noble breed ,</l>
     <l n="3">Goodly to see , and virtuous ; a tamer of the steed ;</l>
     <l n="4">As Indra ‘ midst the gods , so he of kings was kingliest one ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sovereign of men , and splendid as the golden , glittering sun ;</l>
     <l n="6">Pure , knowing scripture , gallant ; ruling nobly Nishadh 's lands ;</l>
     <l n="7">Dice-loving , but a proud , true chief of her embattled bands ;</l>
     <l n="8">By lovely ladies lauded ; free , trained in self-control ;</l>
     <l n="9">A shield and bow ; a Manu on earth ; a royal soul !</l>
     <l n="10">And in Vidarbha 's city the Raja Bhima dwelled ;</l>
     <l n="11">Save offspring , from his perfect bliss no blessing was withheld ;</l>
     <l n="12">For offspring , many a pious rite full patiently he wrought ,</l>
     <l n="13">Till Damana the Brahman unto his house was brought .</l>
     <l n="14">Him Bhima , ever reverent , did courteously entreat ,</l>
     <l n="15">Within the Queen 's pavilion led him , to rest and eat ;</l>
     <l n="16">Whereby that sage , grown grateful , gave her — for joy of joys —</l>
     <l n="17">A girl , the gem of girlhood , and three brave lusty boys —</l>
     <l n="18">Damana , Dama , Dânta , their names :— Damayanti she ;</l>
     <l n="19">No daughter more delightful , no sons could goodlier be .</l>
     <l n="20">Stately and bright and beautiful did Damayanti grow ;</l>
     <l n="21">No land there was which did not the Slender-waisted know ;</l>
     <l n="22">A hundred slaves her fair form decked with robe and ornament —</l>
     <l n="23">Like Śachi 's self to serve her a hundred virgins bent ;</l>
     <l n="24">And ‘ midst them Bhima 's daughter , in peerless glory dight ,</l>
     <l n="25">Gleamed as the lightning glitters against the murk of night ;</l>
     <l n="26">Having the eyes of Lakshmi , long-lidded , black , and bright —</l>
     <l n="27">Nay — never Gods , nor Yakshas , nor mortal men among</l>
     <l n="28">Was one so rare and radiant e'er seen , or sued , or sung</l>
     <l n="29">As she , the heart-consuming , in heaven itself desired .</l>
     <l n="30">And Nala , too , of princes the Tiger-Prince , admired</l>
     <l n="31">Like Kama was ; in beauty an embodied lord of love :</l>
     <l n="32">And ofttimes Nala praised they all other chiefs above</l>
     <l n="33">In Damayanti 's hearing ; and oftentimes to him ,</l>
     <l n="34">With worship and with wonder , her beauty they would limn ;</l>
     <l n="35">So that , unmet , unknowing , unseen , in each for each</l>
     <l n="36">A tender thought of longing grew up from seed of speech ;</l>
     <l n="37">And love ( thou son of Kunti ! ) those gentle hearts did reach .</l>
     <l n="38">Thus Nala — hardly bearing in his heart</l>
     <l n="39">Such longing — wandered in his palace-woods ,</l>
     <l n="40">And marked some water-birds , with painted plumes ,</l>
     <l n="41">Disporting . One , by stealthy steps , he seized ;</l>
     <l n="42">But the sky-traveller spake to Nala this :—</l>
     <l n="43">“ Kill me not , Prince , and I will serve thee well .</l>
     <l n="44">For I , in Damayanti 's ear , will say</l>
     <l n="45">Such good of Nishadh 's lord , that nevermore</l>
     <l n="46">Shall thought of man possess her , save of thee . ”</l>
     <l n="47">Thereat the Prince gladly gave liberty</l>
     <l n="48">To his soft prisoner , and all the swans</l>
     <l n="49">Flew , clanging , to Vidarbha — a bright flock —</l>
     <l n="50">Straight to Vidarbha , where the Princess walked ;</l>
     <l n="51">And there , beneath her eyes , those winged ones</l>
     <l n="52">Lighted . She saw them sail to earth , and marked —</l>
     <l n="53">Sitting amid her maids — their graceful forms ;</l>
     <l n="54">While those for wantonness ‘ gan chase the swans ,</l>
     <l n="55">Which fluttered this and that way through the grove :</l>
     <l n="56">Each girl with tripping feet her bird pursued ,</l>
     <l n="57">And Damayanti , laughing , followed hers ;</l>
     <l n="58">Till — at the point to grasp — the flying prey</l>
     <l n="59">Deftly eluding touch , spake as men speak ,</l>
     <l n="60">Addressing Bhima 's daughter :—</l>
     <l n="61">“ Lady dear !</l>
     <l n="62">Loveliest Damayanti ! Nala dwells</l>
     <l n="63">In near Nishadha : oh , a noble Prince ,</l>
     <l n="64">Not to be matched of men ; an Aświn he ,</l>
     <l n="65">For goodliness . Incomparable maid !</l>
     <l n="66">Wert thou but wife to that surpassing chief ,</l>
     <l n="67">Rich would the fruit grow from such lordly birth ,</l>
     <l n="68">Such peerless beauty . Slender-waisted one ,</l>
     <l n="69">Gods , men , and Gandharvas have we beheld ,</l>
     <l n="70">But never none among them like to him .</l>
     <l n="71">As thou art pearl of princesses , so he</l>
     <l n="72">Is crown of princes ; happy would it fall ,</l>
     <l n="73">One such perfection should another wed . ”</l>
     <l n="74">And when she heard that bird ( O King of men ! )</l>
     <l n="75">The Princess answered : “ Go , dear swan , and tell</l>
     <l n="76">This same to Nala ; ” and the egg-born said ,</l>
     <l n="77">“ I go ” — and flew ; and told the Prince of all .</l>
     <l n="78">But Damayanti , having heard the bird ,</l>
     <l n="79">Lived fancy-free no more ; by Nala 's side</l>
     <l n="80">Her soul dwelt , while she sat at home distraught ,</l>
     <l n="81">Mournful and wan , sighing the hours away ,</l>
     <l n="82">With eyes upcast , and passion-laden looks ;</l>
     <l n="83">So that , eftsoons , her limbs failed , and her mind —</l>
     <l n="84">With love o'erweighted — found no rest in sleep ,</l>
     <l n="85">No grace in company , no joy at feasts .</l>
     <l n="86">Nor night nor day brought peace ; always she heaved</l>
     <l n="87">Sigh upon sigh , till all her maidens knew —</l>
     <l n="88">By glance and mien and moan — how changed she was ,</l>
     <l n="89">Her own sweet self no more . Then to the King</l>
     <l n="90">They told how Damayanti loved the Prince .</l>
     <l n="91">Which thing when Bhima from her maidens heard ,</l>
     <l n="92">Deep pondering for his child what should be done ,</l>
     <l n="93">And why the Princess was beside herself ,</l>
     <l n="94">That lord of lands perceived his daughter grown ,</l>
     <l n="95">And knew that for her high Swayamvara</l>
     <l n="96">The time was come .</l>
     <l n="97">So , to the Rajas all</l>
     <l n="98">The King sent word : “ Ye Lords of Earth , attend</l>
     <l n="99">Of Damayanti the Swayamvara . ”</l>
     <l n="100">And when these learned of her Swayamvara ,</l>
     <l n="101">Obeying Bhima , to his court they thronged —</l>
     <l n="102">Elephants , horses , cars — over the land</l>
     <l n="103">In full files wending , bearing flags and wreaths</l>
     <l n="104">Of countless hues , with gallant companies</l>
     <l n="105">Of fighting men . And those high-hearted chiefs</l>
     <l n="106">The strong-armed King welcomed with worship fair ,</l>
     <l n="107">As fitted each , and led them to their seats .</l>
     <l n="108">Now at that hour there passed towards Indra 's heaven ,</l>
     <l n="109">Thither from earth ascending , those twain saints —</l>
     <l n="110">The wise , the pure , the mighty-minded ones ,</l>
     <l n="111">The self-restrained — Narad and Parvata .</l>
     <l n="112">The mansion of the Sovereign of the Gods</l>
     <l n="113">In honor entered they ; and he , the Lord</l>
     <l n="114">Of Clouds , dread Indra , softly them salutes ,</l>
     <l n="115">Inquiring of their weal , and of the world</l>
     <l n="116">Wherethrough their name was famous , how it fares .</l>
     <l n="117">Then Narad said : “ Well is it , Lord of Gods ,</l>
     <l n="118">With us , and with our world ; and well with those</l>
     <l n="119">Who rule the peoples , O thou King in Heaven ! ”</l>
     <l n="120">But He that slew the Demons spake again :—</l>
     <l n="121">“ The princes of the earth , just-minded , brave ,</l>
     <l n="122">Those who , in battle fearing not to fall ,</l>
     <l n="123">See death on the descending blade , and charge</l>
     <l n="124">Full front against it , turning not their face —</l>
     <l n="125">Theirs is this realm eternal , as to me</l>
     <l n="126">The cow of plenty , Kâmadhuk , belongs .</l>
     <l n="127">Where be my Kshatriya warriors ? Wherefore now</l>
     <l n="128">See I none coming of those slaughtered lords ,</l>
     <l n="129">Chiefs of mankind , our always honored guests ? ”</l>
     <l n="130">And unto Indra Narad gave reply :—</l>
     <l n="131">“ King of the Air ! no wars are waged below ;</l>
     <l n="132">None fall in fight , to enter here . The Lord</l>
     <l n="133">Of high Vidarbha hath a daughter , famed</l>
     <l n="134">For loveliness beyond all earthly maids ,</l>
     <l n="135">The Princess Damayanti , far-renowned .</l>
     <l n="136">Of her , dread Sakra ! the Swayamvara</l>
     <l n="137">Shall soon befall , and thither now repair</l>
     <l n="138">The kings and princes of all lands , to woo —</l>
     <l n="139">Each for himself — this pearl of womanhood .</l>
     <l n="140">For oh , thou Slayer of the Demons , all</l>
     <l n="141">Desire the maid . ”</l>
     <l n="142">Drew round , while Narad spake ,</l>
     <l n="143">The Masters , th'Immortals , pressing in</l>
     <l n="144">With Agni and the Greatest , near the throne ,</l>
     <l n="145">To listen to the speech of Narada ;</l>
     <l n="146">Whom having heard , all cried delightedly ,</l>
     <l n="147">“ We , too , will go . ” Thereupon those high gods ,</l>
     <l n="148">With chariots , and with heavenly retinues ,</l>
     <l n="149">Sped to Vidarbha , where the kings were met .</l>
     <l n="150">And Nala , knowing of this kingly tryst ,</l>
     <l n="151">Went thither joyous , heart-full with the thought</l>
     <l n="152">Of Damayanti .</l>
     <l n="153">Thus it chanced the gods</l>
     <l n="154">Beheld the Prince wending along his road ,</l>
     <l n="155">Goodly of mien , as is the Lord of Love .</l>
     <l n="156">The world 's Protectors saw him , like a sun</l>
     <l n="157">For splendor ; and , in very wonder , paused</l>
     <l n="158">Some time irresolute , so fair he was ;</l>
     <l n="159">Then in mid-sky their golden chariots stayed ,</l>
     <l n="160">And through the clouds descending called to him :—</l>
     <l n="161">“ Abo ! Nala of Nishadha ! Noblest Prince ,</l>
     <l n="162">Be herald for us ; bear our message now . ”</l>
     <l n="163">“ Yea ! ” Nala made reply , “ this will I do ” —</l>
     <l n="164">And then — palm unto palm in reverence pressed —</l>
     <l n="165">Asked : “ Shining Ones , who are ye ? Unto whom ,</l>
     <l n="166">And what words bearing , will ye that I go ?</l>
     <l n="167">Deign to instruct me what it is ye bid . ”</l>
     <l n="168">Thus the Prince spake , and Indra answered him :—</l>
     <l n="169">“ Thou seest th'immortal gods . Indra am I ,</l>
     <l n="170">And this is Agni , and the other here ,</l>
     <l n="171">Varuna , Lord of Waters ; and beyond ,</l>
     <l n="172">Yama , the King of Death , who parteth souls</l>
     <l n="173">From mortal frames . To Damayanti go ;</l>
     <l n="174">Tell our approach . Say this : ‘ The world 's dread lords ,</l>
     <l n="175">Wishful to see thee , come ; desiring thee —</l>
     <l n="176">Indra , Varuna , Agni , Yama , all .</l>
     <l n="177">Choose of these powers to which thou wilt be given . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="178">But Nala , hearing that , joined palms again ,</l>
     <l n="179">And cried : “ Ah , send me not , with one accord</l>
     <l n="180">For this , most mighty Gods ! How should a man</l>
     <l n="181">Sue for another , being suitor too ?</l>
     <l n="182">How bear such errand ? Have compassion , Gods ! ”</l>
     <l n="183">Then spake they : “ Yet thou saidst , ‘ This shall I do , ’</l>
     <l n="184">Nishadha 's Prince ! and wilt thou do it not ,</l>
     <l n="185">Forswearing faith ? Nay , but depart , and soon ! ”</l>
     <l n="186">So bid , but lingering yet again , he said :—</l>
     <l n="187">“ Well guarded are the gates ; how shall I find</l>
     <l n="188">Speech with her ? ”</l>
     <l n="189">“ Thou shalt find , ” Indra replied .</l>
     <l n="190">And , lo ! upon that word Nala was brought</l>
     <l n="191">To Damayanti 's chamber . There he saw</l>
     <l n="192">Vidarbha 's glory , sitting ‘ mid her maids ,</l>
     <l n="193">In majesty and grace surpassing all ;</l>
     <l n="194">So exquisite , so delicate of form ,</l>
     <l n="195">Waist so fine-turned , such limbs , such lighted eyes ,</l>
     <l n="196">The moon hath meaner radiance than she .</l>
     <l n="197">Love at the sight of that soft smiling face</l>
     <l n="198">Sprang to full passion , while he stood and gazed .</l>
     <l n="199">Yet , faith and duty urging , he restrained</l>
     <l n="200">His beating heart ; but when those beauteous maids</l>
     <l n="201">Spied Nala , from their cushions they uprose ,</l>
     <l n="202">Startled to see a man , yet startled more</l>
     <l n="203">Because he showed so heavenly bright and fair .</l>
     <l n="204">In wondering pleasure each saluted him ,</l>
     <l n="205">Uttering no sound , but murmuring to themselves :—</l>
     <l n="206">“ Aho ! the grace of him : aho ! the brilliance ;</l>
     <l n="207">Aho ! what glorious strength lives in his limbs !</l>
     <l n="208">What is he ? Is he God , Gandharva , Yaksha ? ”</l>
     <l n="209">But this unspoken , for they dared not breathe</l>
     <l n="210">One syllable , all standing shyly there</l>
     <l n="211">To see him , and to see his youth so sweet .</l>
     <l n="212">Yet , softly glancing back to his soft glance ,</l>
     <l n="213">The Princess , presently , with fluttering breath ,</l>
     <l n="214">Accosted Nala , saying : “ Fairest Prince ,</l>
     <l n="215">Who by thy faultless form hath filled my heart</l>
     <l n="216">With sudden joy , coming as come the gods ,</l>
     <l n="217">Unstayed , I crave to know thee , who thou art ;</l>
     <l n="218">How didst thou enter ? how wert thou unseen ?</l>
     <l n="219">Our palace is close-guarded , and the King</l>
     <l n="220">Hath issued mandates stern . ”</l>
     <l n="221">Tenderly spake</l>
     <l n="222">The Prince , replying to those tender words :—</l>
     <l n="223">“ Most lovely ! I am Nala . I am come</l>
     <l n="224">A herald of the gods unto thee here .</l>
     <l n="225">The gods desire thee , the immortal Four —</l>
     <l n="226">Indra , Varuna , Yama , Agni . Choose ,</l>
     <l n="227">O Brightest ! one from these to be thy lord .</l>
     <l n="228">By their help is it I have entered in</l>
     <l n="229">Unseen ; none could behold me at thy gates ,</l>
     <l n="230">Nor stay me , passing ; and to speak their will</l>
     <l n="231">They sent me , fairest one and best . Do thou ,</l>
     <l n="232">Knowing the message , judge as seemeth well . ”</l>
     <l n="233">She bowed her head , hearing the great gods named ,</l>
     <l n="234">And then , divinely smiling , said to him :—</l>
     <l n="235">“ Pledge thyself faithfully to me , and I</l>
     <l n="236">Will seek , O Raja , only how to pay</l>
     <l n="237">That debt with all I am , with all I have ;</l>
     <l n="238">For I and mine are thine — in full trust thine .</l>
     <l n="239">Make me that promise , Prince . Thy gentle name —</l>
     <l n="240">Sung by the swan — first set my thoughts afire ;</l>
     <l n="241">And for thy sake — only for thee — sweet Lord ,</l>
     <l n="242">The kings were summoned hither . If , alas !</l>
     <l n="243">Fair Prince , thou dost reject my sudden love ,</l>
     <l n="244">So proffered , then must poison , flame , or flood ,</l>
     <l n="245">Or knitted cord , be my sad remedy . ”</l>
     <l n="246">So spake Vidarbha 's Pride ; and Nala said :—</l>
     <l n="247">“ With gods so waiting — with the world 's dread lords</l>
     <l n="248">Hastening to woo , canst thou desire a man ?</l>
     <l n="249">Bethink ! I , unto these , that make and mar ,</l>
     <l n="250">These all-wise ones , almighty , am like dust</l>
     <l n="251">Under their feet : lift thy heart to the height</l>
     <l n="252">Of what I bring . If mortal man offend</l>
     <l n="253">The most high gods , death is what springs of it .</l>
     <l n="254">Spare me to live , thou faultless lady ! Choose</l>
     <l n="255">Which of these excellent great gods thou wilt ;</l>
     <l n="256">Wear the unstained robes ! bear on thy brows</l>
     <l n="257">The wreaths which never fade , of heavenly blooms !</l>
     <l n="258">Be , as thou mayest , a goddess , and enjoy</l>
     <l n="259">Godlike delights ! Him who enfolds the earth ,</l>
     <l n="260">Creating and consuming , Brightest Power ,</l>
     <l n="261">Hutâsa , Eater of the Sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="262">What woman would not take ? Or him whose rod</l>
     <l n="263">Herds all the generations forward still</l>
     <l n="264">On virtue 's path , Red Yama , King of Death ,</l>
     <l n="265">What woman would affront ? Or him , the all-good ,</l>
     <l n="266">All-wise destroyer of the Demons , first</l>
     <l n="267">In heaven , Mahendra — who of womankind</l>
     <l n="268">Is there that would not wed ? Or , if thy mind</l>
     <l n="269">Incline , doubt not to choose Varuna ; he</l>
     <l n="270">Is of these world-protectors . From a heart</l>
     <l n="271">Full friendly cometh what I tell thee now . ”</l>
     <l n="272">Unto Nishadha 's Prince the maid replied —</l>
     <l n="273">Tears of distress dimming her lustrous eyes — -</l>
     <l n="274">“ Humbly I reverence these mighty gods ;</l>
     <l n="275">But thee I choose , and thee I take for lord ;</l>
     <l n="276">And this I vow ! ”</l>
     <l n="277">With folded palms she stood ,</l>
     <l n="278">And trembling lips , while his faint answer fell :—</l>
     <l n="279">“ Sent on such embassy , how shall I dare</l>
     <l n="280">Speak , sweetest Princess , for myself to thee ?</l>
     <l n="281">Bound by my promise for the gods to sue ,</l>
     <l n="282">How can I be a suitor for myself ?</l>
     <l n="283">Silence is here my duty ; afterwards ,</l>
     <l n="284">If I shall come , in mine own name I 'll come ,</l>
     <l n="285">Mine own cause pleading . Ah , might that so be ! ”</l>
     <l n="286">Checking her tears , Damayanti sadly smiled ,</l>
     <l n="287">And said full soft : “ One way of hope I see ,</l>
     <l n="288">A blameless way , O Lord of men ! wherefrom</l>
     <l n="289">No fault shall rise , nor any danger fall .</l>
     <l n="290">Thou also , Prince , with Indra and these gods ,</l>
     <l n="291">Must enter in where my Swayamvara</l>
     <l n="292">Is held ; then I , in presence of those gods ,</l>
     <l n="293">Will choose thee , dearest , for my lord ; and so</l>
     <l n="294">Blame shall not light on thee , ”</l>
     <l n="295">With which sweet words</l>
     <l n="296">Soft in his ears , Nishadha straight returned</l>
     <l n="297">There where the gods were gathered , waiting him ;</l>
     <l n="298">Whom the world 's masters , on his way , perceived ,</l>
     <l n="299">And , spying , questioned , asking for his news :—</l>
     <l n="300">“ Saw'st thou her , Prince ? Didst see the sweet-lipped one ?</l>
     <l n="301">What spake she of us ? Tell us true ; tell all ! ”</l>
     <l n="302">Quoth Nala : “ By your worshipful behest</l>
     <l n="303">Sent to her house , the great gates entered I ,</l>
     <l n="304">Though the gray porters watched ; but none might spy</l>
     <l n="305">My entering , by your power , O radiant Ones ,</l>
     <l n="306">Saving the Raja 's daughter ; her I saw</l>
     <l n="307">Amid her maidens , and by them was seen .</l>
     <l n="308">On me with much amazement they did gaze</l>
     <l n="309">Whilst I your high Divinities extolled .</l>
     <l n="310">But she that hath the lovely face , with mind</l>
     <l n="311">Set upon me , hath chosen me , ye Gods .</l>
     <l n="312">For thus she spake , my Princess : ‘ Let them come ,</l>
     <l n="313">And come thou , like a lordly tiger , too ,</l>
     <l n="314">Unto the place of my Swayamvara ;</l>
     <l n="315">There will I choose thee in their presence , Prince ,</l>
     <l n="316">To be my lord ; and so there will not fall</l>
     <l n="317">Blame , thou strong-armed ! to thee , ’ This she did say</l>
     <l n="318">Even as I tell it ; and what shall be next ,</l>
     <l n="319">To will is yours , O ye immortal Ones ! ”</l>
     <l n="320">Soon , when the moon was good , and day and hour</l>
     <l n="321">Were found propitious , Bhima , King of men ,</l>
     <l n="322">Summoned the chiefs to the Swayamvara ;</l>
     <l n="323">Upon which message all those eager lords</l>
     <l n="324">For love of Damayanti hastened there .</l>
     <l n="325">Glorious with gilded pillars was the court ,</l>
     <l n="326">Whereto a gate-house opened , and thereby</l>
     <l n="327">Into the square , like lions from the hills ,</l>
     <l n="328">Paced the proud guests ; and there their seats they took ,</l>
     <l n="329">Each in his rank , the masters of the lands ,</l>
     <l n="330">With crowns of fragrant blossoms garlanded ,</l>
     <l n="331">And polished jewels swinging in their ears .</l>
     <l n="332">Of some the thews , knitted and rough , stood forth</l>
     <l n="333">Like iron maces ; some had slender limbs ,</l>
     <l n="334">Sleek and fine-turned like the five-headed snake ;</l>
     <l n="335">Lords with long-flowing hair ; glittering lords ;</l>
     <l n="336">High-nosed , and eagle-eyed , and heavy-browed ;</l>
     <l n="337">The faces of those kings shone in a ring</l>
     <l n="338">As shine at night the stars ; and that great square</l>
     <l n="339">As thronged with Rajas was as Naga-land</l>
     <l n="340">Is full of serpents ; thick with warlike chiefs</l>
     <l n="341">As mountain-caves with panthers . Unto these</l>
     <l n="342">Entered , in matchless majesty of form ,</l>
     <l n="343">The Princess Damayanti . As she came ,</l>
     <l n="344">The glory of her ravished eyes and hearts ,</l>
     <l n="345">So that the gaze of all those haughty kings ,</l>
     <l n="346">Fastening upon her loveliness , grew fixed —</l>
     <l n="347">Not moving save with her — step after step</l>
     <l n="348">Onward and always following the maid .</l>
     <l n="349">But while the styles and dignities of all</l>
     <l n="350">Were cried aloud ( O son of Bhârat ! ) , lo !</l>
     <l n="351">The Princess marked five of that throng alike</l>
     <l n="352">In form and garb and visage . There they stood ,</l>
     <l n="353">Each from the next undifferenced , but each</l>
     <l n="354">Nala 's own self ;— yet which might Nala be</l>
     <l n="355">In nowise could that doubting maid descry .</l>
     <l n="356">Who took her eye seemed Nala while she gazed ,</l>
     <l n="357">Until she looked upon his like ; and so</l>
     <l n="358">Pondered the lovely lady , sore-perplexed ,</l>
     <l n="359">Thinking , “ How shall I tell which be the gods ,</l>
     <l n="360">And which is noble Nala ? ” Deep-distressed</l>
     <l n="361">And meditative waxed she , musing hard</l>
     <l n="362">What those signs were , delivered us of old ,</l>
     <l n="363">Whereby gods may be known : “ Of all those signs</l>
     <l n="364">Taught by our elders , lo ! I see not one</l>
     <l n="365">Where stand yon five . ” So murmured she , and turned</l>
     <l n="366">Over and over every mark she knew .</l>
     <l n="367">At last , resolved to make the gods themselves</l>
     <l n="368">Her help at need , with reverent air and voice</l>
     <l n="369">Humbly saluted she those heavenly ones ,</l>
     <l n="370">And with joined palms and trembling accents spake :—</l>
     <l n="371">“ As , when I heard the swans , I chose my Prince ,</l>
     <l n="372">By that sincerity I call ye , Gods ,</l>
     <l n="373">To show my Love to me and make me know !</l>
     <l n="374">As in my heart and soul and speech I stand</l>
     <l n="375">True to my choice , by that sincerity</l>
     <l n="376">I call the all-knowing gods to make me know !</l>
     <l n="377">As the high gods created Nishadha 's chief</l>
     <l n="378">To be my lord , by their sincerity</l>
     <l n="379">I bid them show themselves , and make me know !</l>
     <l n="380">As my vow , sealed to him , must be maintained</l>
     <l n="381">For his name , and for mine , I call the gods</l>
     <l n="382">By such sincerity to make me know !</l>
     <l n="383">Let them appear , the masters of the world —</l>
     <l n="384">The high gods — each one in his proper shape ,</l>
     <l n="385">That I may see Nishadha 's chief , my choice ,</l>
     <l n="386">Whom minstrels praise , and Damayanti loves . ”</l>
     <l n="387">Hearing that earnest speech — so passion-fraught ,</l>
     <l n="388">So full of truth , of strong resolve , of love ,</l>
     <l n="389">Of singleness of soul and constancy —</l>
     <l n="390">Even as she spake , the gods disclosed themselves .</l>
     <l n="391">By well-seen signs the effulgent Ones she knew .</l>
     <l n="392">Shadowless stood they , with unwinking eyes ,</l>
     <l n="393">And skins which never moist with sweat ; their feet</l>
     <l n="394">Light-gliding o'er the ground , not touching it ;</l>
     <l n="395">The unfading blossoms on their brows not soiled</l>
     <l n="396">By earthly dust , but ever fair and fresh .</l>
     <l n="397">Whilst , by their side , garbed so and visaged so ,</l>
     <l n="398">But doubled by his shadow , stained with dust ,</l>
     <l n="399">The flower-cups wiltering in his wreath , his skin</l>
     <l n="400">Pearly with sweat , his feet upon the earth ,</l>
     <l n="401">And eyes a-wink , stood Nala . One by one</l>
     <l n="402">Glanced she on those divinities , then bent</l>
     <l n="403">Her gaze upon the Prince , and , joyous , said :—</l>
     <l n="404">“ I know thee , and I name my rightful lord ,</l>
     <l n="405">Taking Nishadha 's chief . ” Therewith she drew</l>
     <l n="406">Modestly nigh , and held him by the cloth ,</l>
     <l n="407">With large eyes beaming love , and round his neck</l>
     <l n="408">Hung the bright chaplet , love 's delicious crown ;</l>
     <l n="409">So choosing him — him only — whom she named</l>
     <l n="410">Before the face of all to be her lord .</l>
     <l n="411">Oh , then brake forth from all those suitors proud ,</l>
     <l n="412">“ Ha ! ” and “ Aho ! ” But from the gods and saints ,</l>
     <l n="413">“ Sadhu ! well done ! well done ! ” And all admired</l>
     <l n="414">The happy Prince , praising the grace of him ;</l>
     <l n="415">While Virasena 's son , delightedly ,</l>
     <l n="416">Spake to the slender-waisted these fond words :—</l>
     <l n="417">“ Fair Princess ! since , before all gods and men ,</l>
     <l n="418">Thou makest me thy choice , right glad am I</l>
     <l n="419">Of this thy mind , and true lord will I be .</l>
     <l n="420">For so long , loveliest , as my breath endures ,</l>
     <l n="421">Thine am I ! Thus I plight my troth to thee . ”</l>
     <l n="422">So , with joined palms , unto that beauteous maid</l>
     <l n="423">His gentle faith he pledged , rejoicing her ;</l>
     <l n="424">And , hand in hand , radiant with mutual love ,</l>
     <l n="425">Before great Agni and the gods they passed ,</l>
     <l n="426">The world 's protectors worshipping .</l>
     <l n="427">Then those ,</l>
     <l n="428">The lords of life , the powerful Ones , bestowed —</l>
     <l n="429">Being well-pleased — on Nala , chosen so ,</l>
     <l n="430">Eight noble boons . The boon which Indra gave</l>
     <l n="431">Was grace , at times of sacrifice , to see</l>
     <l n="432">The visible god approach , with step divine ;</l>
     <l n="433">And Agni 's boon was this , that he would come</l>
     <l n="434">Whenever Nala called — for everywhere</l>
     <l n="435">Hutâsa shineth , and all worlds are his ;</l>
     <l n="436">Yama gave skill in cookery , steadfastness</l>
     <l n="437">In virtue ; and Varuna , King of Floods ,</l>
     <l n="438">Bade all the waters ripple at his call .</l>
     <l n="439">These boons the high gods doubled by the gift</l>
     <l n="440">Of bright wreaths wove with magic blooms of heaven ;</l>
     <l n="441">And those bestowed , ascended to their seats .</l>
     <l n="442">Also with wonder and with joy returned</l>
     <l n="443">The Rajas and the Maharajas all ,</l>
     <l n="444">Full of the marriage-feast ; for Bhima made ,</l>
     <l n="445">In pride and pleasure , stately nuptials ;</l>
     <l n="446">So Damayanti and the Prince were wed .</l>
     <l n="447">Then , having tarried as is wont , that lord —</l>
     <l n="448">Nishadha 's chief — took the King 's leave , and went</l>
     <l n="449">Unto his city , bringing home with him</l>
     <l n="450">His jewel of all womanhood , with whom</l>
     <l n="451">Blissful he lived , as lives by Śachi 's side</l>
     <l n="452">The slayer of the Demons . Like a sun</l>
     <l n="453">Shone Nala on his throne , ruling his folk</l>
     <l n="454">In strength and virtue , guardian of his state .</l>
     <l n="455">Also the Aśwamedha Rite he made</l>
     <l n="456">Greatest of rites , the Offering of the Horse ,</l>
     <l n="457">As did Yayâti ; and all other acts</l>
     <l n="458">Of worship ; and to sages gave rich gifts .</l>
     <l n="459">Many dear days of much delicious love ,</l>
     <l n="460">In pleasant gardens and in shadowy groves ,</l>
     <l n="461">Passed they together , sojourning like gods .</l>
     <l n="462">And Damayanti bore unto her lord</l>
     <l n="463">A boy named Indrasen , and next , a girl</l>
     <l n="464">Named Indrasena . So in happiness</l>
     <l n="465">The good Prince governed , seeing all his lands</l>
     <l n="466">Wealthy and well , in piety and peace .</l>
     <l n="467">Now at the choosing of Nishadha 's chief</l>
     <l n="468">By Bhima 's daughter , when those lords of life —</l>
     <l n="469">The effulgent gods — departed , Dwapara</l>
     <l n="470">They saw with Kali , coming . Indra said —</l>
     <l n="471">The Demon-slayer — spying these approach :—</l>
     <l n="472">“ Whither , with Dwapara , goest thou to-day ,</l>
     <l n="473">O Kali ? ” And the sombre Shade replied :—</l>
     <l n="474">“ To Damayanti 's high Swayamvara</l>
     <l n="475">I go , to make her mine , since she hath passed</l>
     <l n="476">Into my heart . ” But Indra , laughing , said :—</l>
     <l n="477">“ Ended is that Swayamvara ; for she</l>
     <l n="478">Hath taken Raja Nala for her lord ,</l>
     <l n="479">Before us all , ” But Kali , hearing this ,</l>
     <l n="480">Breaks into wrath — while he stood worshipping</l>
     <l n="481">That band divine — and furiously cries :—</l>
     <l n="482">“ If she hath set a man above the gods ,</l>
     <l n="483">To wed with him , for such sin let there fall</l>
     <l n="484">Doom , rightful , swift , and terrible , on her ! ”</l>
     <l n="485">“ Nay , ” answered unto him those heavenly ones ,</l>
     <l n="486">“ But Damayanti chose with our good-will ;</l>
     <l n="487">And what maid but would choose so fair a prince ,</l>
     <l n="488">Seeing he hath all qualities , and knows</l>
     <l n="489">Virtue , and rightly practises the vows ,</l>
     <l n="490">And reads the four great Vedas , and , what 's next ,</l>
     <l n="491">The Holy Stories , whilst , perpetually ,</l>
     <l n="492">The gods are honored in his house with gifts ?</l>
     <l n="493">No hurt he does , kind to all living things ;</l>
     <l n="494">True of word is he , faithful , liberal , just ;</l>
     <l n="495">Steadfast and patient , temperate and pure ;</l>
     <l n="496">A king of men is Nala , like the gods .</l>
     <l n="497">He that would curse a prince of such a mould ,</l>
     <l n="498">Thou foolish Kali , lays upon himself</l>
     <l n="499">A sin to crush himself ; the curse comes back</l>
     <l n="500">And sinks him in the bottomless vast gulf</l>
     <l n="501">Of Narak . ”</l>
     <l n="502">Thus the gods to Kali spake ,</l>
     <l n="503">And mounted heavenward ; whereupon that Shade ,</l>
     <l n="504">Frowning , to Dwapara burst forth : “ My rage</l>
     <l n="505">Beareth no curb . Henceforth in Nala I</l>
     <l n="506">Will dwell ; his kingdom I will make to fall ;</l>
     <l n="507">His bliss with Damayanti I will mar ;</l>
     <l n="508">And thou within the dice shalt enter straight ,</l>
     <l n="509">And help me , Dwapara ! to drag him down , ”</l>
     <l n="510">Into which compact entering , those repaired —</l>
     <l n="511">Kali and Dwapara — to Nala 's house ,</l>
     <l n="512">And haunted in Nishadha , where he ruled ,</l>
     <l n="513">Seeking occasion ‘ gainst the blameless Prince .</l>
     <l n="514">Long watched they ; twelve years rolled ere Kali saw</l>
     <l n="515">The fateful fault arrive ; Nishadha 's Lord ,</l>
     <l n="516">Easing himself , and sprinkling hands and lips</l>
     <l n="517">With purifying water , passed to prayer ,</l>
     <l n="518">His feet unwashed , offending . Kali straight</l>
     <l n="519">Possessed the heedless Raja , entering him .</l>
     <l n="520">That hour there sat with Nala , Pushkara</l>
     <l n="521">His brother ; and the evil spirit hissed</l>
     <l n="522">Into the ear of Pushkara : “ Ehi !</l>
     <l n="523">Arise , and challenge Nala at the dice .</l>
     <l n="524">Throw with the Prince ! it may be thou shalt win</l>
     <l n="525">( Luck helping thee , and I ) Nishadha 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="526">Town , treasures , palace — thou mayest gain them all . ”</l>
     <l n="527">And Pushkara , hearing Kali 's evil voice ,</l>
     <l n="528">Made near to Nala , with the dice in hand</l>
     <l n="529">( A great piece for the “ Bull , ” and little ones</l>
     <l n="530">For “ Cows , ” and Kali hiding in the Bull ) .</l>
     <l n="531">So Pushkara came to Nala 's side and said :—</l>
     <l n="532">“ Play with me , brother , at the ‘ Cows and Bull ’ ; ”</l>
     <l n="533">And , being put off , cried mockingly , “ Nay , play ! ”</l>
     <l n="534">Shaming the Prince , whose spirit chafed to leave</l>
     <l n="535">A gage unfaced ; but when Vidarbha 's gem ,</l>
     <l n="536">The Princess , heard that challenge , Nala rose :</l>
     <l n="537">“ Yea , Pushkara , I will play ! ” fiercely he said ;</l>
     <l n="538">And to the game addressed .</l>
     <l n="539">His gems he lost ,</l>
     <l n="540">Armlets and belt and necklet ; next the gold</l>
     <l n="541">Of the palace and its vessels ; then the cars</l>
     <l n="542">Yoked with swift steeds ; and last , the royal robes :</l>
     <l n="543">For , cast by cast , the dice against him fell ,</l>
     <l n="544">Bewitched by Kali ; and , cast after cast ,</l>
     <l n="545">The passion of the dice kept hold on him ,</l>
     <l n="546">Until not one of all his faithfullest</l>
     <l n="547">Could stay the madman 's hand and gamester 's heart</l>
     <l n="548">Of who was named “ Subduer of his Foes . ”</l>
     <l n="549">The townsmen gathered with the ministers :</l>
     <l n="550">Into that palace gate they thronged ( my King ! )</l>
     <l n="551">To see their lord , if so they might abate</l>
     <l n="552">This sickness of his soul . The charioteer ,</l>
     <l n="553">Forth standing from their midst , low worshipping ,</l>
     <l n="554">Spake thus to Damayanti : “ Great Princess ,</l>
     <l n="555">Before thy door all the grieved city sits .</l>
     <l n="556">Say to our lord for us , ‘ Thy folk are here ;</l>
     <l n="557">They mourn that evil fortunes hold their liege ,</l>
     <l n="558">Who was so high and just , ’ ” Then she , deject ,</l>
     <l n="559">Passed in , and to Nishadha 's ruler said ,</l>
     <l n="560">Her soft voice broken , and her bright eyes dimmed :—</l>
     <l n="561">“ Raja , the people of thy town are here ;</l>
     <l n="562">Before our gates they gather , citizens</l>
     <l n="563">And counsellors , desiring speech with thee ;</l>
     <l n="564">In lealty they come . Wilt thou be pleased</l>
     <l n="565">We open to them ? Wilt thou ? ” So she asked</l>
     <l n="566">Again and yet again ; but not one word</l>
     <l n="567">To that sad lady with the lovely brows</l>
     <l n="568">Did Nala answer , wholly swallowed up</l>
     <l n="569">Of Kali and the gaming ; so that those —</l>
     <l n="570">The citizens and counsellors — cried out ,</l>
     <l n="571">“ Our lord is changed ! He is not Nala now ! ”</l>
     <l n="572">And home returned , ashamed and sorrowful ;</l>
     <l n="573">Whilst ceaselessly endured that foolish play</l>
     <l n="574">Moon after moon — the Prince the loser still .</l>
     <l n="575">Then Damayanti , seeing so estranged</l>
     <l n="576">Her lord , the praised in song , the chief of men ,</l>
     <l n="577">Watching , all self-possessed , his fantasy ,</l>
     <l n="578">And how the gaming held him ; sad , and ‘ feared ,</l>
     <l n="579">The heavy fortunes pondering of her Prince ;</l>
     <l n="580">Hating the fault , but to the offender kind ;</l>
     <l n="581">And fearing Nala should be stripped of all ,</l>
     <l n="582">This thing devised : Vrihatsenâ she called —</l>
     <l n="583">Her foster-nurse and faithful ministrant —</l>
     <l n="584">True , skilful at all service , soft of speech ,</l>
     <l n="585">Kind-hearted ; and she said , “ Vrihatsenâ ,</l>
     <l n="586">Go call the ministers to council now ,</l>
     <l n="587">As though ‘ twere Nala bade ; and make them count</l>
     <l n="588">What store is gone of treasure , what abides . ”</l>
     <l n="589">So went Vrihatsenâ , and summoned those ;</l>
     <l n="590">And when they knew all things , as from the Prince ,</l>
     <l n="591">“ Truly we , too , shall perish ! ” cried they then ;</l>
     <l n="592">And all to Nala went , and all the town ,</l>
     <l n="593">A second time assembling , thronged his gates :—</l>
     <l n="594">Which Bhima 's daughter told ; but not one word</l>
     <l n="595">Answered the Prince . And when she saw her lord</l>
     <l n="596">Put by her plea , utterly slighting it ,</l>
     <l n="597">Back to her chamber , full of shame , she goes ,</l>
     <l n="598">And there still hears the dice are falling ill ;</l>
     <l n="599">Still hears of Nala daily losing more ;</l>
     <l n="600">So that again unto her nurse she spake :—</l>
     <l n="601">“ Send to Varshneya , good Vrihatsenâ ;</l>
     <l n="602">Say to the charioteer — in Nala 's name —</l>
     <l n="603">‘ A great thing is to do . Come thou ! ’ ” And this —</l>
     <l n="604">So soon as Damayanti uttered it —</l>
     <l n="605">Vrihatsenâ , by faithful servants , told</l>
     <l n="606">Unto the son of Vrishni , who , being come</l>
     <l n="607">In fitting time and place , heard the sweet Queen</l>
     <l n="608">In mournful music speak these wistful words :—</l>
     <l n="609">“ Thou knowest how thy Raja trusted thee ;</l>
     <l n="610">Now he hath fall'n on evil ; succor him !</l>
     <l n="611">The more that Pushkara conquers in the play ,</l>
     <l n="612">The wilder rage of gaming takes thy lord —</l>
     <l n="613">The more for Pushkara the dice light well ,</l>
     <l n="614">More contrary they happen to the Prince :</l>
     <l n="615">Nor heeds he , as were meet , kindred or friends ;</l>
     <l n="616">Nay , of myself he putteth by the prayer</l>
     <l n="617">Unanswered , being bewitched ; for well I deem</l>
     <l n="618">This is not noble-minded Nala 's sin ,</l>
     <l n="619">But some ill spell possesseth him to shut</l>
     <l n="620">His ears to me . Thou , therefore , charioteer !</l>
     <l n="621">Our refuge be ; do what I shall command ;</l>
     <l n="622">My heart is dark with fear . Yea , it may fall</l>
     <l n="623">Our lord will perish . Wherefore , harnessing</l>
     <l n="624">His chosen steeds , which fly as swift as thought .</l>
     <l n="625">Take these our children in the chariot</l>
     <l n="626">And drive to Kundina , delivering there</l>
     <l n="627">Unto my kin the little ones , and car ,</l>
     <l n="628">And horses . Afterwards abide thou there ,</l>
     <l n="629">Or otherwhere depart . ”</l>
     <l n="630">Varshneya heard</l>
     <l n="631">The words of Damayanti , and forthwith</l>
     <l n="632">In Nala 's council-hall recounted them ,</l>
     <l n="633">The chief men being present ; who , thus met ,</l>
     <l n="634">And long debating , gave him leave to go .</l>
     <l n="635">So with that royal pair to Bhima 's town</l>
     <l n="636">Drove he , and at Vidarbha rendered up ,</l>
     <l n="637">Together with the swift steeds and the car ,</l>
     <l n="638">That sweet maid Indrasena , and the Prince</l>
     <l n="639">Indrasen , and made reverence to the King ,</l>
     <l n="640">Saddened for sake of Nala . Afterwards</l>
     <l n="641">Taking his leave , unto Ayodhyâ</l>
     <l n="642">Varshneya went , exceeding sorrowful ,</l>
     <l n="643">And with King Rituparna ( O my Prince ! )</l>
     <l n="644">Took service as a charioteer .</l>
     <l n="645">These gone —</l>
     <l n="646">The praised-of-poets , Nala , still played on ,</l>
     <l n="647">Till Pushkara his kingdom 's wealth had won ,</l>
     <l n="648">And whatso was to lose beside . Thereat</l>
     <l n="649">With scornful laugh mocked he that beggared Prince ,</l>
     <l n="650">Saying , “ One other throw ; once more !— Yet sooth ,</l>
     <l n="651">What canst thou stake ? Nothing is left for thee</l>
     <l n="652">Save Damayanti ; all the rest is mine .</l>
     <l n="653">Play we for Damayanti , if thou wilt . ”</l>
     <l n="654">But hearing this from Pushkara , the Prince</l>
     <l n="655">So in his heart by grief and shame was torn ,</l>
     <l n="656">No word he uttered — only glared in wrath</l>
     <l n="657">Upon his mocker , upon Pushkara .</l>
     <l n="658">Then , his rich robes and jewels stripping off ,</l>
     <l n="659">Uncovered , with one cloth , ‘ mid waiting friends</l>
     <l n="660">Sorrowful passed he forth , his great state gone ;</l>
     <l n="661">The Princess , with one garment , following him ,</l>
     <l n="662">Piteous to see . And there without the gates</l>
     <l n="663">Three nights they lay — Nashadha 's King and Queen .</l>
     <l n="664">Upon the fourth day Pushkara proclaimed ,</l>
     <l n="665">Throughout the city , “ Whoso yieldeth help</l>
     <l n="666">To Nala , dieth ! Let my will be known ! ”</l>
     <l n="667">So , for this bitter word of Pushkara 's power</l>
     <l n="668">( O Yudhisthir ! ) the townsmen rendered not</l>
     <l n="669">Service nor love , but left them outcast there ,</l>
     <l n="670">Unhelped , whom all the city should have helped .</l>
     <l n="671">Yet three nights longer tarried he , his drink</l>
     <l n="672">The common pool , his meat such fruits and roots</l>
     <l n="673">As miserable hunger plucks from earth :</l>
     <l n="674">Then fled they from those walls , the Prince going first ,</l>
     <l n="675">The Princess following .</l>
     <l n="676">After grievous days ,</l>
     <l n="677">Pinched ever with sharp famine , Nala saw</l>
     <l n="678">A flock of gold-winged birds lighting anigh ,</l>
     <l n="679">And to himself the famished Raja said :—</l>
     <l n="680">“ Lo ! here is food ; this day we shall have store ; ”</l>
     <l n="681">Then lightly cast his cloth and covered them .</l>
     <l n="682">But these , fluttering aloft , bore with them there</l>
     <l n="683">Nala 's one cloth ; and , hovering overhead ,</l>
     <l n="684">Uttered sharp-stinging words , reviling him</l>
     <l n="685">Even as he stood , naked to all the airs ,</l>
     <l n="686">Downcast and desperate : “ Thou brain-sick Prince !</l>
     <l n="687">We are the dice ; we come to ravish hence</l>
     <l n="688">Thy last poor cloth ; we were not well content</l>
     <l n="689">Thou shouldst depart owning a garment still . ”</l>
     <l n="690">And when he saw the dice take wings and fly ,</l>
     <l n="691">Leaving him bare , to Damayanti spake</l>
     <l n="692">This melancholy Prince : “ O Blameless One ,</l>
     <l n="693">They by whose malice I am driven forth ,</l>
     <l n="694">Finding no sustenance , sad , famine-gaunt —</l>
     <l n="695">They whose decree forbade Nishadha 's folk</l>
     <l n="696">Should succor me , their Raja — these have come —</l>
     <l n="697">Demon and dice — and like to winged birds</l>
     <l n="698">Have borne away my cloth . To such shame fall'n ,</l>
     <l n="699">Such utmost woe , wretched , demented — I</l>
     <l n="700">Thy lord am still , and counsel thee for good .</l>
     <l n="701">Attend ! Hence be there many roads which go</l>
     <l n="702">Southwards : some pass Avanti 's walls , and some</l>
     <l n="703">Skirt Rikshavan , the forest of the bears ;</l>
     <l n="704">This wends to Vindhya 's lofty peaks , and this</l>
     <l n="705">To the green banks where quick Payoshni runs</l>
     <l n="706">Seaward , between her hermitages , rich</l>
     <l n="707">In fruits and roots ; and yon path leadeth thee</l>
     <l n="708">Unto Vidarbha ; that to Kosala ,</l>
     <l n="709">And therefrom southward — southward — far away . ”</l>
     <l n="710">So spake he to the Princess wistfully ,</l>
     <l n="711">Between his words pointing along the paths ,</l>
     <l n="712">Which she should take ( O King ! ) . But Bhima 's child</l>
     <l n="713">Made answer , bowed with grief , her soft voice choked</l>
     <l n="714">With sobs , these piteous accents uttering :—</l>
     <l n="715">“ My heart beats quick ; my body 's force is gone ,</l>
     <l n="716">Thinking , dear Prince , on this which thou hast said ,</l>
     <l n="717">Pointing along the paths . What ! robbed of realm ,</l>
     <l n="718">Stripped of thy wealth , bare , famished , parched with thirst ,</l>
     <l n="719">Thus shall I leave thee in the untrodden wood ?</l>
     <l n="720">Ah , no ! While thou dost muse on dear days fled ,</l>
     <l n="721">Hungry and weeping , I in this wild waste</l>
     <l n="722">Will charm thy griefs away , solacing thee .</l>
     <l n="723">The wisest doctors say , ‘ In every woe</l>
     <l n="724">No better physic is than wifely love , ’</l>
     <l n="725">And , Nala , I will make it true to thee . ”</l>
     <l n="726">“ Thou mak'st it true , ” he said ; “ thou sayest well ,</l>
     <l n="727">Sweet Damayanti ; neither is there friend</l>
     <l n="728">To sad men given better than a wife .</l>
     <l n="729">I had not thought to leave thee , foolish Love !</l>
     <l n="730">Why didst thou fear ? Alas , ‘ t is from myself</l>
     <l n="731">That I would fly — not thee , thou Faultless One ! ”</l>
     <l n="732">“ Yet , if , ” the Princess answered , “ Maharaja !</l>
     <l n="733">Thou hadst no thought to leave me , why by thee</l>
     <l n="734">Was the way pointed to Vidarbha 's walls ?</l>
     <l n="735">I know thou wouldst not quit me , noblest Lord ,</l>
     <l n="736">Being thyself , but only if thy mind</l>
     <l n="737">Were sore distraught ; and see , thou gazest still</l>
     <l n="738">Along the southward road , my dread thereby</l>
     <l n="739">Increasing , thou that wert as are the gods !</l>
     <l n="740">If it be thy fixed thought , ‘ Twere best she went</l>
     <l n="741">Unto her people ’ — be it so ; I go ;</l>
     <l n="742">But hand in hand with thee . Thus let us fare</l>
     <l n="743">Unto Vidarbha , where the King , my sire ,</l>
     <l n="744">Will greet thee well , and honor thee ; and we</l>
     <l n="745">Happy and safe within his gates shall dwell . ”</l>
     <l n="746">“ As is thy father 's kingdom , ” Nala said ,</l>
     <l n="747">“ So , once , was mine . Be sure , whatever betide ,</l>
     <l n="748">Never will I go thither ! How , in sooth ,</l>
     <l n="749">Should I , who came there glorious , gladdening thee ,</l>
     <l n="750">Creep back , thy shame and scorn , disconsolate ? ”</l>
     <l n="751">So to sweet Damayanti spake the Prince ,</l>
     <l n="752">Beguiling her , whom now one cloth scarce clad —</l>
     <l n="753">For but one garb they shared ; and thus they strayed</l>
     <l n="754">Hither and thither , faint for meat and drink ,</l>
     <l n="755">Until a little hut they spied ; and there ,</l>
     <l n="756">Nishadha 's monarch , entering , sat him down</l>
     <l n="757">On the bare ground , the Princess by his side —</l>
     <l n="758">Vidarbha 's glory , wearing that scant cloth ,</l>
     <l n="759">Without a mat , soiled by the dust and mire .</l>
     <l n="760">At Damayanti 's side he sank asleep ,</l>
     <l n="761">Outworn ; and beauteous Damayanti slept ,</l>
     <l n="762">Spent with strange trials — -  she so gently reared ,</l>
     <l n="763">So soft and holy . But while slumbering thus ,</l>
     <l n="764">No peaceful rest knew Nala . Trouble-tossed</l>
     <l n="765">He woke , forever thinking of his realm</l>
     <l n="766">Lost , lieges estranged , and all the griefs</l>
     <l n="767">Of that wild wood . These on his heart came back ,</l>
     <l n="768">And , “ What if I shall do it ? What , again ,</l>
     <l n="769">If I shall do it not ? ” So murmured he .</l>
     <l n="770">“ Would death be better , or to leave my Love ?</l>
     <l n="771">For my sake she endures this woe , my fate</l>
     <l n="772">Too fondly sharing ; freed from me , her steps</l>
     <l n="773">Would turn unto her people . At my side ,</l>
     <l n="774">Sure suffering is her portion ; but apart ,</l>
     <l n="775">It might be she would somewhere comfort find . ”</l>
     <l n="776">Thus with himself debating o'er and o'er ,</l>
     <l n="777">The Prince resolves abandonment were best .</l>
     <l n="778">“ For how , ” saith he , “ should any in the wood</l>
     <l n="779">Harm her , so radiant in her grace , so good ,</l>
     <l n="780">So noble , virtuous , faithful , famous , pure ? ”</l>
     <l n="781">Thus mused his miserable mind , seduced</l>
     <l n="782">By Kali 's cursed mischiefs to betray</l>
     <l n="783">His sleeping wife . Then , seeing his loin-cloth gone ,</l>
     <l n="784">And Damayanti clad , he drew anigh ,</l>
     <l n="785">Thinking to take of hers , and muttering ,</l>
     <l n="786">“ May I not rend one fold , and she not know ? ”</l>
     <l n="787">So meditating , round the cabin crept</l>
     <l n="788">Prince Nala , feeling up and down its walls ;</l>
     <l n="789">And , presently , within the purlieus found</l>
     <l n="790">A naked knife , keen-tempered ; therewithal</l>
     <l n="791">Shred he away a piece , and bound it on ;</l>
     <l n="792">Then made with desperate steps to seek the waste ,</l>
     <l n="793">Leaving the Princess sleeping ; but , anon ,</l>
     <l n="794">Turns back again in changeful mood and glides</l>
     <l n="795">Into the hut , and , gazing wistfully</l>
     <l n="796">On slumbering Damayanti , moans with tears :—</l>
     <l n="797">“ Ah , Sweetheart ! whom nor wind nor sun before</l>
     <l n="798">Hath ever rudely touched ; thou to be couched</l>
     <l n="799">In this poor hut , its floor thy bed , and I ,</l>
     <l n="800">Thy lord , deserting thee , stealing from thee</l>
     <l n="801">Thy last robe ! O my Love with the bright smile ,</l>
     <l n="802">My slender-waisted Queen ! Will she not wake</l>
     <l n="803">To madness ? Yea , and when she wanders lone</l>
     <l n="804">In the dark wood , haunted with beasts and snakes ,</l>
     <l n="805">How will it fare with Bhima 's tender child ,</l>
     <l n="806">The bright and peerless ? O my life , my wife !</l>
     <l n="807">May the great sun , may the Eight Powers of air ,</l>
     <l n="808">The Rudras , Maruts , and the Aświns twain ,</l>
     <l n="809">Guard thee , thou true and dear one , on thy way ! ”</l>
     <l n="810">So to his sleeping Queen — on all the earth</l>
     <l n="811">Unmatched for beauty — spake he piteously ;</l>
     <l n="812">Then breaks away once more , by Kali driven .</l>
     <l n="813">But yet another and another time</l>
     <l n="814">Stole back into the hut , for one last gaze —</l>
     <l n="815">That way by Kali dragged , this way by love .</l>
     <l n="816">Two hearts he had — the trouble-stricken Prince —</l>
     <l n="817">One beating “ Go , ” one throbbing “ Stay ” ; and thus</l>
     <l n="818">Backwards and forwards swung his mind between ,</l>
     <l n="819">Till , mastered by the sorrow and the spell ,</l>
     <l n="820">Frantic flies Nala , leaving there alone</l>
     <l n="821">That tender-sleeper , sighing as she slept .</l>
     <l n="822">He flies — the soulless prey of Kali flies ;</l>
     <l n="823">Still , while he hurries through the forest drear ,</l>
     <l n="824">Thinking upon that sweet face he hath left .</l>
     <l n="825">Far distant ( King ! ) was Nala , when , refreshed ,</l>
     <l n="826">The slender-waisted wakened , shuddering</l>
     <l n="827">At the wood 's silence ; but when , seeking him ,</l>
     <l n="828">She found no Nala , sudden anguish seized</l>
     <l n="829">Her frightened heart , and , lifting high her voice ,</l>
     <l n="830">Loud cries she : “ Maharaja ! Nishadha 's Prince !</l>
     <l n="831">Ha , Lord ! ha , Maharaja ! ha , Master ! why</l>
     <l n="832">Hast thou abandoned me ? Now am I lost ,</l>
     <l n="833">Am doomed , undone , left in this lonesome gloom .</l>
     <l n="834">Wert thou not named , O Nala , true and just ?</l>
     <l n="835">Yet art thou such , to quit me while I slept ?</l>
     <l n="836">And hast thou so forsaken me , thy wife —</l>
     <l n="837">Thine own fond wife — who never wrought thee wrong</l>
     <l n="838">When by all others wrong was wrought on thee ?</l>
     <l n="839">Mak'st thou it good to me , now , Lord of men ,</l>
     <l n="840">That love which long ago before the gods</l>
     <l n="841">Thou didst proclaim ? Alas ! Death will not come ,</l>
     <l n="842">Except at his appointed time to men ,</l>
     <l n="843">And therefore for a little I shall live ,</l>
     <l n="844">Whom thou hast lived to leave . Nay , ‘ t is a jest !</l>
     <l n="845">Ah , Truant , Runaway , enough thou play'st !</l>
     <l n="846">Come forth , my Lord !— I am afraid ! Come forth !</l>
     <l n="847">Linger not , for I see — I spy thee there ;</l>
     <l n="848">Thou art within yon thicket ! Why not speak</l>
     <l n="849">One word , Nishadha ? Nala , cruel Prince !</l>
     <l n="850">Thou know'st me , lone , and comest not to calm</l>
     <l n="851">My terrors , and be with me in my need .</l>
     <l n="852">Art gone indeed ? Then I 'll not mourn myself ,</l>
     <l n="853">For whatso may befall me ; I must think</l>
     <l n="854">How desolate thou art , and weep for thee .</l>
     <l n="855">What wilt thou do , thirsty and hungry , spent</l>
     <l n="856">With wandering , when , at nightfall , ‘ mid the trees</l>
     <l n="857">Thou hast me not , sweet Prince , to comfort thee ? ”</l>
     <l n="858">Thereat , distracted by her bitter fears ,</l>
     <l n="859">Like one whose heart is fire , forward and back</l>
     <l n="860">She runs , hither and thither , weeping , wild .</l>
     <l n="861">One while she sinks to earth , one while she springs</l>
     <l n="862">Quick to her feet ; now utterly overcome</l>
     <l n="863">By fear and fasting , now by grief driven mad ,</l>
     <l n="864">Wailing and sobbing ; till anon , with moans</l>
     <l n="865">And broken sighs and tears , Bhima 's fair child ,</l>
     <l n="866">The ever-faithful wife , speaks thus again :—</l>
     <l n="867">“ By whomsoever 's spell this harm hath fall'n</l>
     <l n="868">On Nishadha 's Lord , I pray that evil one</l>
     <l n="869">May bear a bitterer plague than Nala doth !</l>
     <l n="870">To him , whoever set my guileless Prince</l>
     <l n="871">On these ill deeds , I pray some direr might</l>
     <l n="872">May bring far darker days , and life to live</l>
     <l n="873">More miserable still ! ”</l>
     <l n="874">Thus , woe-begone ,</l>
     <l n="875">Mourned that great-hearted wife her vanished lord ,</l>
     <l n="876">Seeking him ever in the gloomy shades ,</l>
     <l n="877">By wild beasts haunted . Roaming everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="878">Like one possessed , frantic , disconsolate ,</l>
     <l n="879">Went Bhima 's daughter . “ Ha , ha ! Maharaja ! ”</l>
     <l n="880">So crying runs she , so in every place</l>
     <l n="881">Is heard her ceaseless wail , as when is heard</l>
     <l n="882">The fish-hawk 's cry , which screams , and circling screams ,</l>
     <l n="883">And will not stint complaining .</l>
     <l n="884">Suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="885">Straying too near his den , a serpent 's coils</l>
     <l n="886">Seized Bhima 's daughter . A prodigious snake ,</l>
     <l n="887">Glittering and strong , and furious for food ,</l>
     <l n="888">Knitted about the Princess . She , o'erwhelmed</l>
     <l n="889">With horror , and the cold enfolding death ,</l>
     <l n="890">Spends her last breaths in pitiful laments</l>
     <l n="891">For Nala , not herself . “ Ah , Prince ! ” she cried ,</l>
     <l n="892">“ That would have saved me , who must perish now ,</l>
     <l n="893">Seized in the lone wood by this hideous snake ,</l>
     <l n="894">Why art thou not beside me ? What will be</l>
     <l n="895">Thy thought , Nishadha ! me remembering</l>
     <l n="896">In days to come , when , from the curse set free ,</l>
     <l n="897">Thou hast thy noble mind again , thyself ,</l>
     <l n="898">Thy wealth — all save thy wife ? Then thou'lt be sad ,</l>
     <l n="899">Be weary , wilt need food and drink ; but I</l>
     <l n="900">Shall minister no longer . Who will tend</l>
     <l n="901">My Love , my Lord , my Lion among kings ,</l>
     <l n="902">My blameless Nala — Damayanti dead ? ”</l>
     <l n="903">That hour a hunter , roving through the brake ,</l>
     <l n="904">Heard her bewailing , and with quickened steps</l>
     <l n="905">Made nigh , and , spying a woman , almond-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="906">Lovely , forlorn , by that fell monster knit ,</l>
     <l n="907">He ran , and , as he came , with keen shaft clove ,</l>
     <l n="908">Through gaping mouth and crown , th'unwitting worm ,</l>
     <l n="909">Slaying it . Then the woodman from its folds</l>
     <l n="910">Freed her , and laved the snake 's slime from her limbs</l>
     <l n="911">With water of the pool , comforting her</l>
     <l n="912">And giving food ; and afterwards ( my King ! )</l>
     <l n="913">Inquiry made : “ What doest , in this wood ,</l>
     <l n="914">Thou with the fawn 's eyes ? And how earnest thou ,</l>
     <l n="915">My mistress , to such pit of misery ? ”</l>
     <l n="916">And Damayanti , spoken fair by him ,</l>
     <l n="917">Recounted all which had befallen her .</l>
     <l n="918">But , gazing on her graces , scantly clad</l>
     <l n="919">With half a cloth , those smooth , full sides , those breasts</l>
     <l n="920">Beauteously swelling , form of faultless mould ,</l>
     <l n="921">Sweet youthful face , fair as the moon at full ,</l>
     <l n="922">And dark orbs , by long curving lashes swept ;</l>
     <l n="923">Hearing her tender sighs and honeyed speech ,</l>
     <l n="924">The hunter fell to hot desire ; he dared</l>
     <l n="925">Essay to woo , with whispered words at first ,</l>
     <l n="926">And next by amorous approach , the Queen ;</l>
     <l n="927">Who , presently perceiving what he would ,</l>
     <l n="928">And all that baseness of him — being so pure ,</l>
     <l n="929">So chaste , and faithful — like a blazing torch</l>
     <l n="930">Took fire of scorn and anger ‘ gainst the man ,</l>
     <l n="931">Her true soul burning at him , till the wretch ,</l>
     <l n="932">Wicked in heart , but impotent of will ,</l>
     <l n="933">Glared on her , splendidly invincible</l>
     <l n="934">In weakness , loftily defying wrong ,</l>
     <l n="935">A living flame of lighted chastity .</l>
     <l n="936">She then — albeit so desolate , so lone ,</l>
     <l n="937">Abandoned by her lord , stripped of her state —</l>
     <l n="938">Like a proud princess stormed , flinging away</l>
     <l n="939">All terms of supplication , cursing him</l>
     <l n="940">With wrath which scorched : “ If I am clean in heart</l>
     <l n="941">And true in thought unto Nishadha 's King ,</l>
     <l n="942">Then mayest thou , vile pursuer of the beasts ,</l>
     <l n="943">Sink to the earth , stone dead ! ”</l>
     <l n="944">While she did speak ,</l>
     <l n="945">The hunter breathless fell to earth , stone dead ,</l>
     <l n="946">As falls a tree-trunk blasted by the bolt .</l>
     <l n="947">That ravisher destroyed , the lotus-eyed</l>
     <l n="948">Fared forward , threading still the fearful wood ,</l>
     <l n="949">Lonely and dim , with trill of jhillikas<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span></l>
     <l n="950">Resounding , and fierce noise of many beasts</l>
     <l n="951">Laired in its shade , lions and leopards , deer ,</l>
     <l n="952">Close-hiding tigers , sullen bisons , wolves ,</l>
     <l n="953">And shaggy bears . Also the glades of it</l>
     <l n="954">Were filled with fowl which crept , or flew , and cried .</l>
     <l n="955">A home for savage men and murderers ,</l>
     <l n="956">Thick with a world of trees , whereof was sal ,</l>
     <l n="957">Sharp-seeded , weeping gum ; knotted bambus ,</l>
     <l n="958">Dhavas with twisted roots ; smooth aswatthas ,</l>
     <l n="959">Large-leaved , and creeping through the cloven rocks ;</l>
     <l n="960">Tindukas , iron-fibred , dark of grain ;</l>
     <l n="961">Ingudas , yielding oil ; and kinsukas ,</l>
     <l n="962">With scarlet flowerets flaming . Thronging these</l>
     <l n="963">Were arjuns and arishta-clumps , which bear</l>
     <l n="964">The scented purple clusters ; syandans ,</l>
     <l n="965">And tall silk-cotton trees , and mango-belts</l>
     <l n="966">With silvery spears ; and wild rose-apple , blent</l>
     <l n="967">‘ Mid lodhra-tufts and khadirs , interknit</l>
     <l n="968">By clinging rattans , climbing everywhere</l>
     <l n="969">From stem to stem . Therewith were intermixed —</l>
     <l n="970">Round pools where rocked the lotus — âmalaks ,</l>
     <l n="971">Plakshas with fluted leaves , kadambas sweet ,</l>
     <l n="972">Udumbaras ; and , on the jungle-edge ,</l>
     <l n="973">Tangles of reed and jujube , whence there rose</l>
     <l n="974">Bel-trees and nyagrodhas , dropping roots</l>
     <l n="975">Down from the air ; broad-leaved priyâlas , palms</l>
     <l n="976">And date-trees , and the gold myrobalan ,</l>
     <l n="977">With copper-leaved vibhîtikas . All these</l>
     <l n="978">Crowded the wood ; and many a crag it held ,</l>
     <l n="979">With precious ore of metals interveined ;</l>
     <l n="980">And many a creeper-covered cave wherein</l>
     <l n="981">The spoken word rolled round ; and many a cleft</l>
     <l n="982">Where the thick stems were like a wall to see ;</l>
     <l n="983">And many a winding stream and reedy jheel ,</l>
     <l n="984">And glassy lakelet , where the woodland beasts</l>
     <l n="985">In free peace gathered .</l>
     <l n="986">Wandering onward thus ,</l>
     <l n="987">The Princess saw far-gliding forms of dread —</l>
     <l n="988">Pisâchas , Rakshasas , ill sprites and fiends</l>
     <l n="989">Which haunt , with swinging snakes , the undergrowth .</l>
     <l n="990">Dark pools she saw , and drinking-holes , and peaks</l>
     <l n="991">Wherefrom break down in tumbling cataracts</l>
     <l n="992">The wild white waters , marvellous to hear .</l>
     <l n="993">Also she passed — this daughter of a king —</l>
     <l n="994">Where snorted the fierce buffaloes , and where</l>
     <l n="995">The gray boars rooted for their food , and where</l>
     <l n="996">The black bears growled , and serpents in the grass</l>
     <l n="997">Rustled and hissed . But all along that way</l>
     <l n="998">Safe paced she in her majesty of grace ,</l>
     <l n="999">High fortune , courage , constancy , and right —</l>
     <l n="1000">Vidarbha 's glory — seeking , all alone ,</l>
     <l n="1001">Lost Nala ; and less terror at these sights</l>
     <l n="1002">Came to sad Damayanti for herself —</l>
     <l n="1003">Threading this dreadful forest — than for him .</l>
     <l n="1004">Most was her mind on Nala 's fate intent .</l>
     <l n="1005">Bitterly grieving stood the sweet Princess</l>
     <l n="1006">Upon a rock , her tender limbs a-thrill</l>
     <l n="1007">With heavy fears for Nala while she spake :—</l>
     <l n="1008">“ Broad-chested Chief ! my long-armed Lord of men !</l>
     <l n="1009">Nishadha 's King ! Ah ! whither art thou gone .</l>
     <l n="1010">Leaving me thus in the unpeopled wood ?</l>
     <l n="1011">The Aśwamedha sacrifice thou mad'st ,</l>
     <l n="1012">And all the rites and royal gifts hast given ,</l>
     <l n="1013">A lion-hearted Prince , holy and true</l>
     <l n="1014">To all save me ! That which thou didst declare ,</l>
     <l n="1015">Hand in hand with me — once so fond and kind —</l>
     <l n="1016">Recall it now — thy sacred word , thy vow ,</l>
     <l n="1017">Whithersoever , Raja , thou art fled .</l>
     <l n="1018">Think how the message of the gold-winged swans</l>
     <l n="1019">Was spoken , by thine own lips , then to me !</l>
     <l n="1020">True men keep faith ; this is the teaching taught</l>
     <l n="1021">In Vedas , Angas , and Upangas all ,</l>
     <l n="1022">Hear which we may ; wilt thou not , therefore , Prince —</l>
     <l n="1023">Wilt thou not , terror of thy foes , keep faith ,</l>
     <l n="1024">Making thy promise good to cleave to me ?</l>
     <l n="1025">Ha , Nala , Lord ! Am I not surely still</l>
     <l n="1026">Thy chosen , thy beloved ? Answerest not</l>
     <l n="1027">Thy wife in this dark , horror-haunted shade ?</l>
     <l n="1028">The tyrant of the jungle , fierce and fell ,</l>
     <l n="1029">With jaws agape to take me , crouches nigh ,</l>
     <l n="1030">And thou not here to rescue me — not thou ,</l>
     <l n="1031">Who saidst none other in the world was dear</l>
     <l n="1032">But Damayanti ! Prove the fond speech true ,</l>
     <l n="1033">Uttered so often ! Why repliest not</l>
     <l n="1034">To me , thy well-beloved ; me , distraught ,</l>
     <l n="1035">Longed for and longing ; me , my Prince and pride ,</l>
     <l n="1036">That am so weary , weak , and miserable ,</l>
     <l n="1037">Stained with the mire , in this torn cloth half clad ,</l>
     <l n="1038">Alone and weeping , seeing no help near ?</l>
     <l n="1039">Ah , stag of all the herd ! leav'st thou thy hind</l>
     <l n="1040">Astray , regarding not these tears which roll ?</l>
     <l n="1041">My Nala , Maharaja ! It is I</l>
     <l n="1042">Who cry , thy Damayanti , true and pure ,</l>
     <l n="1043">Lost in the wood , and still thou answerest not !</l>
     <l n="1044">High-born , high-hearted , full of grace and strength</l>
     <l n="1045">In all thy limbs , shall I not find thee soon</l>
     <l n="1046">On yonder hill ? Shall I not see , at last ,</l>
     <l n="1047">In some track of this grim , beast-peopled wood ,</l>
     <l n="1048">Standing , or seated , or upon the leaves</l>
     <l n="1049">Lying , or coming , him who is of men</l>
     <l n="1050">The glory , but for me the grief-maker ?</l>
     <l n="1051">If not , whom shall I question , woe-begone ,</l>
     <l n="1052">Saying , ‘ In any region of this wood</l>
     <l n="1053">Hast thou , perchance , seen Nala ? ’ Is there none ,</l>
     <l n="1054">In all the forest , would reply to me</l>
     <l n="1055">With tidings of my lord , wandered away ,</l>
     <l n="1056">Kingly in mind and form , of hosts of foes</l>
     <l n="1057">The conqueror ? Who will say , with blessed voice ,</l>
     <l n="1058">‘ That Raja with the lotus-eyes is near ,</l>
     <l n="1059">Whom thou dost seek ’ ?— Nay , here comes one to ask ,</l>
     <l n="1060">The yellow forest-king , his great jaws armed</l>
     <l n="1061">With fourfold fangs . A tiger standeth now</l>
     <l n="1062">Face to face on my path ; I 'll speak with him</l>
     <l n="1063">Fearlessly : ‘ Dreadful chief of all this waste ,</l>
     <l n="1064">Thou art the sovereign of the beasts , and I</l>
     <l n="1065">Am daughter of Vidarbha 's King ; my name ,</l>
     <l n="1066">The Princess Damayanti ; know thou me ,</l>
     <l n="1067">Wife of Nishadha 's Lord — of Nala — styled</l>
     <l n="1068">“ Subduer of his Foes ” ? Him seek I here —</l>
     <l n="1069">Abandoned , sorrow-stricken , miserable .</l>
     <l n="1070">Comfort me , mighty beast , if so thou canst ,</l>
     <l n="1071">Saying thou hast seen Nala ; but if this</l>
     <l n="1072">Thou canst not do , then , ah , thou savage lord ,</l>
     <l n="1073">Terrible friend , devour me , setting me</l>
     <l n="1074">Free from all woes ! ’ The tiger answereth not ;</l>
     <l n="1075">He turns , and quits me in my tears , to stalk</l>
     <l n="1076">Down where the river glitters through the reeds ,</l>
     <l n="1077">Seeking its seaward way . Then will I pray</l>
     <l n="1078">Unto yon sacred mount of clustered crags ,</l>
     <l n="1079">Broad-shouldered , shining , lifting high to heaven</l>
     <l n="1080">Its diverse-colored peaks , where the mind climbs</l>
     <l n="1081">Its hid heart rich with silver veins , and gold ,</l>
     <l n="1082">And stored with many a precious gem unseen .</l>
     <l n="1083">Clear towers it o'er the forest , broad and bright</l>
     <l n="1084">Like a green banner ; and the sides of it</l>
     <l n="1085">House many a living thing — lions and boars ,</l>
     <l n="1086">Tigers and elephants , and bears and deer .</l>
     <l n="1087">Softly around me from its feathered flocks</l>
     <l n="1088">The songs ring , perched upon the kinsuk trees ,</l>
     <l n="1089">The asokas , vakuls , and punnâga boughs ,</l>
     <l n="1090">Or hidden in the karnikara leaves ,</l>
     <l n="1091">And tendrils of the dhava or the fig ;</l>
     <l n="1092">Full of great glens it soars , where waters leap</l>
     <l n="1093">And bright birds lave . This king of hills I sue</l>
     <l n="1094">For tidings of my lord . O Mountain Lord ,</l>
     <l n="1095">Far-seen and celebrated hill ! that cleav'st</l>
     <l n="1096">The blue of the sky , refuge of living things ,</l>
     <l n="1097">Most noble eminence , I worship thee ;</l>
     <l n="1098">Thee I salute , who am a monarch 's child ,</l>
     <l n="1099">The daughter and the consort of a prince ,</l>
     <l n="1100">The high-born Damayanti , unto whom</l>
     <l n="1101">Bhima , Vidarbha 's chief — that puissant lord —</l>
     <l n="1102">Was sire , renowned o'er earth . Protector he</l>
     <l n="1103">Of the four castes , performer of the rites</l>
     <l n="1104">Called Rajasuya and the Aśwamedha —</l>
     <l n="1105">A bounteous giver , first of rulers , known</l>
     <l n="1106">For his large shining eyes ; holy and just ,</l>
     <l n="1107">Fast to his word , unenvious , sweet of speech ,</l>
     <l n="1108">Gentle and valiant , dutiful and pure ;</l>
     <l n="1109">The guardian of Vidarbha , of his foes</l>
     <l n="1110">The slayer . Know me , O Majestic Mount !</l>
     <l n="1111">For that King 's daughter , bending low to thee .</l>
     <l n="1112">In Nishadha lived the father of my lord ,</l>
     <l n="1113">The Maharaja Virasena named ,</l>
     <l n="1114">Wealthy and great ; whose son , of regal blood ,</l>
     <l n="1115">High-fortuned , powerful , and noble-souled ,</l>
     <l n="1116">Ruleth by right the realm paternal : he</l>
     <l n="1117">Is Nala , terror of all enemies ;</l>
     <l n="1118">Dark Nala , praised-in-song ; Nala the just ,</l>
     <l n="1119">The pure ; deep-seen in scriptures , sweet of speech ,</l>
     <l n="1120">Drinker of Soma-juice , and worshipper</l>
     <l n="1121">Of Agni ; sacrificing , giving gifts ;</l>
     <l n="1122">First in the wars , a perfect , princely lord .</l>
     <l n="1123">His wife am I , Great Mountain ! and come here</l>
     <l n="1124">Fortuneless , husbandless , and spiritless ,</l>
     <l n="1125">Everywhere seeking him , my best of men .</l>
     <l n="1126">O Mount , whose doubled ridge stamps on the sky</l>
     <l n="1127">Yon line , by fivescore splendid pinnacles</l>
     <l n="1128">Indented ! tell me , in this gloomy wood</l>
     <l n="1129">Hast thou seen Nala ? Nala , wise and bold ,</l>
     <l n="1130">Like a tusked elephant for might ; long armed ,</l>
     <l n="1131">Indomitable , gallant , glorious , true ;</l>
     <l n="1132">Nala , Nishadha 's chief — hast thou seen him ?</l>
     <l n="1133">O Mountain , why consolest thou me not ,</l>
     <l n="1134">Answering one word to sorrowful , distressed ,</l>
     <l n="1135">Lonely , lost Damayanti ? ”</l>
     <l n="1136">Then she cried :—</l>
     <l n="1137">“ But answer for thyself , Hero and Lord !</l>
     <l n="1138">If thou art in the forest , show thyself !</l>
     <l n="1139">Alas ! when shall I hear that voice , as low ,</l>
     <l n="1140">As tender as the murmur of the rain</l>
     <l n="1141">When great clouds gather ; sweet as Amrit-drink ?</l>
     <l n="1142">Thy voice , once more , my Nala , calling to me</l>
     <l n="1143">Full softly , ‘ Damayanti ! ’ — dearest Prince ,</l>
     <l n="1144">That would be music soothing to these ears</l>
     <l n="1145">As sound of sacred Veda ; that would stay</l>
     <l n="1146">My pains and comfort me , and bring me peace . ”</l>
     <l n="1147">Thereafter , turning from the mount , she went</l>
     <l n="1148">Northwards , and journeying on three nights and days</l>
     <l n="1149">Came to a green incomparable grove</l>
     <l n="1150">By holy men inhabited ; a haunt</l>
     <l n="1151">Placid as Paradise , whose indwellers</l>
     <l n="1152">Like to Vaśistha , Bhrigu , Atri , were —</l>
     <l n="1153">Those ancient saints . Restraining sense they lived ,</l>
     <l n="1154">Heedful in meats , subduing passion , pure ,</l>
     <l n="1155">Breathing within ; their food water and herbs ;</l>
     <l n="1156">Ascetics ; very holy ; seeking still</l>
     <l n="1157">The heavenward road ; clad in the bark of trees</l>
     <l n="1158">And skins — all gauds of earth being put by .</l>
     <l n="1159">This hermitage , peopled by gentle ones ,</l>
     <l n="1160">Glad Damayanti spied , circled with herds</l>
     <l n="1161">Of wild things grazing fearless , and with troops</l>
     <l n="1162">Of monkey-folk o'erheard ; and when she saw ,</l>
     <l n="1163">Her heart was lightened , for its quietness .</l>
     <l n="1164">So drew she nigh — that lovely wanderer —</l>
     <l n="1165">Bright-browed , long-tressed , large-hipped , full-bosomed , fair ,</l>
     <l n="1166">With pearly teeth and honeyed mouth , in gait</l>
     <l n="1167">Right queenly still , having those long black eyes —</l>
     <l n="1168">The wife of Virasena 's son , the gem</l>
     <l n="1169">Of all dear women , glory of her time ;</l>
     <l n="1170">Sad Damayanti entered their abode ,</l>
     <l n="1171">Those holy men saluting reverently ,</l>
     <l n="1172">With modest body bowed . Thus stood she there</l>
     <l n="1173">And all the saints spake gently , “ Swâgatam —</l>
     <l n="1174">Welcome ! ” and gave the greetings which are meet ;</l>
     <l n="1175">And afterwards , “ Repose thyself , ” they said ;</l>
     <l n="1176">“ What wouldst thou have of us ? ” Then , with soft words</l>
     <l n="1177">The slender-waisted spake : “ Of all these here ,</l>
     <l n="1178">So worshipful in sacrifice and rite —</l>
     <l n="1179">‘ Mid gentle beasts and birds — in tasks and toils</l>
     <l n="1180">And blameless duties — is it well ? ” And they</l>
     <l n="1181">Answered : “ We thank you , noble lady , well .</l>
     <l n="1182">Tell us , most beauteous one , thy name , and say</l>
     <l n="1183">What thou desirest . Seeing thee so fair ,</l>
     <l n="1184">So worthy , yet so sorrowful , our minds</l>
     <l n="1185">Are lost in wonder . Weep not . Comfort take .</l>
     <l n="1186">Art thou the goddess of the wood ? Art thou</l>
     <l n="1187">The Mountain-Yakshi , or , belike , some sprite</l>
     <l n="1188">Which lives under the river ? Tell us true ,</l>
     <l n="1189">Gentle and faultless form ! ”</l>
     <l n="1190">Whereat reply</l>
     <l n="1191">Thus made she to the Rishis : “ None of these</l>
     <l n="1192">Am I , good saints . No goddess of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="1193">Nor yet a mountain nor a river sprite ;</l>
     <l n="1194">A woman ye behold , most only ones ,</l>
     <l n="1195">Whose moving story I will tell you true .</l>
     <l n="1196">The Raja of Vidarbha is my sire ,</l>
     <l n="1197">Bhima his name , and — Best of Twice-born !— know</l>
     <l n="1198">My husband is Nishadha 's Chief , the famed ,</l>
     <l n="1199">The wise and valiant and victorious Prince ,</l>
     <l n="1200">The high and lordly Nala ; of the gods</l>
     <l n="1201">A steadfast worshipper ; of Bráhmanas</l>
     <l n="1202">The friend ; his people 's shield ; honored and strong ,</l>
     <l n="1203">Truth-speaking , skilled in arms , sagacious , just ;</l>
     <l n="1204">Terrible to his foes , fortunate , lord</l>
     <l n="1205">Of many conquered towns ; a godlike man ,</l>
     <l n="1206">Princeliest of princes — Nala — one that hath</l>
     <l n="1207">A countenance like the full moon 's for light ,</l>
     <l n="1208">And eyes of lotus . This true offerer</l>
     <l n="1209">Of sacrifices , this close votary</l>
     <l n="1210">Of Vedas and Vedângas , in the war</l>
     <l n="1211">Deadly to enemies , like sun and moon</l>
     <l n="1212">For splendor — by some certain evil ones</l>
     <l n="1213">Being defied to dice , my virtuous Prince</l>
     <l n="1214">Was , by their wicked acts , of realm despoiled —</l>
     <l n="1215">Wealth , jewels , all . I am his woful wife ,</l>
     <l n="1216">The Princess Damayanti . Seeking him</l>
     <l n="1217">Through thickets have I roamed , over rough hills ,</l>
     <l n="1218">By crag and river and the reedy lake ,</l>
     <l n="1219">By marsh and waterfall and jungle-bush ,</l>
     <l n="1220">In quest of him — my lord , my warrior ,</l>
     <l n="1221">My hero — and still roam , uncomforted .</l>
     <l n="1222">Worshipful brethren ! say if he hath come —</l>
     <l n="1223">Nishadha 's Chief , my Nala , hitherward</l>
     <l n="1224">Unto your pleasant homes — he , for whose sake</l>
     <l n="1225">I wander in the dismal pathless wood</l>
     <l n="1226">With bears and tigers haunted — terrible !</l>
     <l n="1227">Ah ! if I find him not , ere there be passed</l>
     <l n="1228">Many more nights and days , peace will I win ;</l>
     <l n="1229">For death shall set my mournful spirit free .</l>
     <l n="1230">What cause have I to live , lacking my Prince ?</l>
     <l n="1231">Why should I longer breathe , whose heart is dead</l>
     <l n="1232">With sorrow for my lord ? ”</l>
     <l n="1233">To Bhima 's child ,</l>
     <l n="1234">So in the wood bewailing , made reply</l>
     <l n="1235">Those holy , truthful men : “ Beautiful One !</l>
     <l n="1236">The future is for thee ; fair will it fall !</l>
     <l n="1237">Our eyes , by long devotions opened , see —</l>
     <l n="1238">Even now — thy lord ; thou shalt behold him soon ,</l>
     <l n="1239">Nishadha 's chief , the famous Nala , strong</l>
     <l n="1240">In battle , loving justice . Yea , this Prince</l>
     <l n="1241">Thou wilt regain , Bhima 's sad daughter ! freed</l>
     <l n="1242">From troubles , purged of sin ; and witness him —</l>
     <l n="1243">With all his gems and glories — governing</l>
     <l n="1244">Nishadha once again , invincible ,</l>
     <l n="1245">Joy of his friends and terror of his foes .</l>
     <l n="1246">Yea , Noblest , thou shalt have thy love anew</l>
     <l n="1247">In days to come . ”</l>
     <l n="1248">So speaking , from the sight</l>
     <l n="1249">Of Damayanti , at that instant , passed</l>
     <l n="1250">Hermits , with hermitage and holy fires ,</l>
     <l n="1251">Evanishing . In wonderment she stood ,</l>
     <l n="1252">Gazing bewildered . Then the Princess cried :—</l>
     <l n="1253">“ Was it in dream I saw them ? Whence befell</l>
     <l n="1254">This unto me ? Where are the brethren gone ,</l>
     <l n="1255">The ring of huts , the pleasant stream that ran</l>
     <l n="1256">With birds upon its crystal banks , the grove</l>
     <l n="1257">Delightful , with its fruits and flowers ? ” Long while</l>
     <l n="1258">Pondered and wondered Damayanti there ,</l>
     <l n="1259">Her bright smile fled , pale , strengthless , sorrowful ;</l>
     <l n="1260">Then to another region of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="1261">With sighs , and eyes welling great tears , she passed ,</l>
     <l n="1262">Lamenting ; till a beauteous tree she spied —</l>
     <l n="1263">The Asoka , best of trees . Fair rose it there</l>
     <l n="1264">Beside the forest , glowing with the flame</l>
     <l n="1265">Of golden and crimson blossoms , and its boughs</l>
     <l n="1266">Full of sweet-singing birds .</l>
     <l n="1267">“ Ahovat — Look ! ”</l>
     <l n="1268">She cried : “ Ah , lovely tree , that wavest here</l>
     <l n="1269">Thy crown of countless , shining , clustering blooms</l>
     <l n="1270">As thou wert woodland king — Asoka tree ,</l>
     <l n="1271">Tree called ‘ the sorrow-ender , ’ heart'shYpppHeNease tree !</l>
     <l n="1272">Be what thy name saith — end my sorrow now ,</l>
     <l n="1273">Saying , ah , bright Asoka ! thou hast seen</l>
     <l n="1274">My Prince , my dauntless Nala ; seen that lord</l>
     <l n="1275">Whom Damayanti loves and his foes fear ;</l>
     <l n="1276">Seen great Nishadha 's Chief , so dear to me ,</l>
     <l n="1277">His tender princely skin in rended cloth</l>
     <l n="1278">Scantily clad . Hath he passed wandering</l>
     <l n="1279">Under thy branches , grievously forlorn ?</l>
     <l n="1280">Answer , Asoka ! ‘ Sorrow-ender , ’ speak !</l>
     <l n="1281">That I go sorrowless , O heart'shYpppHeNease , be</l>
     <l n="1282">Truly heart-easing — ease my heart of pain . ”</l>
     <l n="1283">Thus , wild with grief , she spake unto the tree ,</l>
     <l n="1284">Round and round walking , as to reverence it ;</l>
     <l n="1285">And then , unanswered , the sweet lady sped</l>
     <l n="1286">Through wastes more dreadful , passing many a</l>
     <l n="1287">Many still-gliding rillets , many a peak</l>
     <l n="1288">Tree-clad , with beasts and birds of wondrous kind ,</l>
     <l n="1289">In dark ravines , and caves , and lonely glooms .</l>
     <l n="1290">These things saw Damayanti , Bhima 's child ,</l>
     <l n="1291">Seeking her lord .</l>
     <l n="1292">At last , on the long road ,</l>
     <l n="1293">She , whose soft smile was once so beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="1294">A caravan encountered . Merchantmen</l>
     <l n="1295">With trampling horses , elephants , and wains ,</l>
     <l n="1296">Made passage of a river , running slow</l>
     <l n="1297">In cool , clear waves . The quiet waters gleamed ,</l>
     <l n="1298">Shining and wide outspread , between the canes</l>
     <l n="1299">Which bordered it , wherefrom echoed the cries</l>
     <l n="1300">Of fish-hawks , curlews , and red chakravâks ,</l>
     <l n="1301">With sounds of leaping fish and water-snakes ,</l>
     <l n="1302">And tortoises , amid its shoals and flats</l>
     <l n="1303">Sporting or feeding .</l>
     <l n="1304">When she spied that throng —</l>
     <l n="1305">Heart-maddened with her anguish , weak and wan ,</l>
     <l n="1306">Half clad , bloodless and thin , her long black locks</l>
     <l n="1307">Matted with dust — breathlessly breaks she in</l>
     <l n="1308">Upon them — Nala 's wife — so beauteous once ,</l>
     <l n="1309">So honored . Seeing her , some fled in fear ;</l>
     <l n="1310">Some gazed , speechless with wonder ; some called out ,</l>
     <l n="1311">Mocking the piteous face by words of scorn ;</l>
     <l n="1312">But some ( my King ! ) had pity of her woe ,</l>
     <l n="1313">And spake her fair , inquiring : “ Who art thou ?</l>
     <l n="1314">And whence ? And in this grove what seekest thou ,</l>
     <l n="1315">To come so wild ? Thy mien astonisheth .</l>
     <l n="1316">Art of our kind , or art thou something strange ,</l>
     <l n="1317">The spirit of the forest , or the hill ,</l>
     <l n="1318">Or river valley ? Tell us true ; then we</l>
     <l n="1319">Will buy thy favor . If , indeed , thou art</l>
     <l n="1320">Yakshini , Rakshasi , or she-creature</l>
     <l n="1321">Haunting this region , be propitious ! Send</l>
     <l n="1322">Our caravan in safety on its path ,</l>
     <l n="1323">That we may quickly , by thy fortune , go</l>
     <l n="1324">Homeward , and all fair chances fall to us . ”</l>
     <l n="1325">Hereby accosted , softly gave response</l>
     <l n="1326">That royal lady — weary for her lord —</l>
     <l n="1327">Answering the leader of the caravan ,</l>
     <l n="1328">And those that gathered round , a marvelling throng</l>
     <l n="1329">Of men and boys and elders : “ Oh , believe</l>
     <l n="1330">I am as you , of mortal birth , but born</l>
     <l n="1331">A Raja 's child , and made a Raja 's wife .</l>
     <l n="1332">Him seek I , Chieftain of Nishadha , named</l>
     <l n="1333">Prince Nala — famous , glorious , first in war .</l>
     <l n="1334">If ye know aught of him , my king , my joy ,</l>
     <l n="1335">My tiger of the jungle , my lost lord ,</l>
     <l n="1336">Quick , tell me , comfort me ! ”</l>
     <l n="1337">Then one who led</l>
     <l n="1338">Their line — the merchant Śuchi — answering ,</l>
     <l n="1339">Spake to the peerless Princess : “ Hear me now .</l>
     <l n="1340">I am the captain of this caravan ,</l>
     <l n="1341">But nowhere any named by Nala 's name</l>
     <l n="1342">Have I , or these , beheld . Of evil beasts</l>
     <l n="1343">The woods were full — cheetahs and bears and cats ,</l>
     <l n="1344">Tigers and elephants , bison and boar ;</l>
     <l n="1345">Those saw we in the brake on every side ,</l>
     <l n="1346">But nowhere nought of human shape , save thee .</l>
     <l n="1347">May Manibhadra have us in his grace —</l>
     <l n="1348">The Lord of Yakshas — as I tell thee truth ! ”</l>
     <l n="1349">Then sadly spake she to the trader-chief</l>
     <l n="1350">And to his band : “ Whither wend ye , I pray ?</l>
     <l n="1351">Please ye , acquaint me where this Sârthâ<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>goes . ”</l>
     <l n="1352">Replied the captain : “ Unto Chedi 's realm ,</l>
     <l n="1353">Where rules the just Subâhu , journey we ,</l>
     <l n="1354">To sell our merchandise , daughter of men ! ”</l>
     <l n="1355">Thus by the chieftain of the band informed ,</l>
     <l n="1356">The peerless Princess journeyed with them , still</l>
     <l n="1357">Seeking her lord . And at the first the way</l>
     <l n="1358">Fared through another forest , dark and deep ;</l>
     <l n="1359">Afterwards came the traders to a pool</l>
     <l n="1360">Broad , everywhere delightful , odorous</l>
     <l n="1361">With cups of opened lotus , and its shores</l>
     <l n="1362">Green with rich grass , and edged with garden trees —</l>
     <l n="1363">A place of flowers and fruits and singing birds .</l>
     <l n="1364">So cool and clear and peacefully it gleamed ,</l>
     <l n="1365">That men and cattle , weary with the march ,</l>
     <l n="1366">Clamored to pitch ; and , on their chieftain 's sign ,</l>
     <l n="1367">The pleasant hollow entered they , and camped —</l>
     <l n="1368">All the long caravan — at sunset 's hour .</l>
     <l n="1369">There , in the quiet of the middle night ,</l>
     <l n="1370">Deep slumbered these ; when , sudden on them fell</l>
     <l n="1371">A herd of elephants , thirsting to drink ,</l>
     <l n="1372">In rut , the mada<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>oozing from their heads .</l>
     <l n="1373">And when those great beasts spied the caravan ,</l>
     <l n="1374">And smelled the tame cows of their kind , they rushed</l>
     <l n="1375">Headlong , and , mad with must , overwhelming all ,</l>
     <l n="1376">With onset vast and irresistible .</l>
     <l n="1377">As when from some tall peak into the plain</l>
     <l n="1378">Thunder and smoke and crash the rolling rocks ,</l>
     <l n="1379">Through splintered stems and thorns breaking their path ,</l>
     <l n="1380">So swept the herd to where , beside the pool ,</l>
     <l n="1381">Those sleepers lay ; and trampled them to earth</l>
     <l n="1382">Half-risen , helpless , shrieking in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="1383">“ Haha ! the elephants ! ” Of those unslain ,</l>
     <l n="1384">Some in the thickets sought a shelter ; some ,</l>
     <l n="1385">Yet dazed with sleep , stood panic-stricken , mute ;</l>
     <l n="1386">Till here with tusks , and there with trunks , the beasts</l>
     <l n="1387">Gored them , and battered them , and trod them flat</l>
     <l n="1388">Under their monstrous feet . Then might be seen</l>
     <l n="1389">Camels with camel-drivers , perishing ,</l>
     <l n="1390">And men flying in fear , who struck at men —</l>
     <l n="1391">Terror and death and clamor everywhere :</l>
     <l n="1392">While some , despairing , cast themselves to earth ;</l>
     <l n="1393">And some , in fleeing , fell and died ; and some</l>
     <l n="1394">Climbed to the tree-tops . Thus on every side</l>
     <l n="1395">Scattered and ruined was that caravan —</l>
     <l n="1396">Cattle and merchants — by the herd assailed .</l>
     <l n="1397">So hideous was the tumult , - all three worlds</l>
     <l n="1398">Seemed filled with fright ; and one was heard to cry :—</l>
     <l n="1399">“ The fire is in the tents ! fly for your lives !</l>
     <l n="1400">Stay not ! ” And others cried : “ Look where we leave</l>
     <l n="1401">Our treasures trodden down ; gather them ! Halt !</l>
     <l n="1402">Why run ye , losing ours and yours ? Nay , stay !</l>
     <l n="1403">Stand ye , and we will stand ! ” And then to these</l>
     <l n="1404">One voice cried , “ Stand ! ” another , “ Fly ! we die ! ”</l>
     <l n="1405">Answered by those again who shouted , “ Stand !</l>
     <l n="1406">Think what we lose , O cowards ! ”</l>
     <l n="1407">While this rout</l>
     <l n="1408">Raged , amid dying groans and sounds of fear ,</l>
     <l n="1409">The Princess , waking startled , terror-struck ,</l>
     <l n="1410">Saw such a sight as might the boldest daunt —</l>
     <l n="1411">Such scene as those great lovely lotus-eyes</l>
     <l n="1412">Ne'er gazed upon before . Sick with new dread —</l>
     <l n="1413">Her breath suspended ‘ twixt her lips — she rose</l>
     <l n="1414">And heard , of those surviving , some one moan</l>
     <l n="1415">Amidst his fellows : “ From whose evil act</l>
     <l n="1416">Is this the fruit ? Hath worship not been paid</l>
     <l n="1417">To mighty Manibhadra ? Gave we not</l>
     <l n="1418">The reverence due to Vaishravan , that King</l>
     <l n="1419">Of all the Yakshas ? Was not offering made</l>
     <l n="1420">At outset to the spirits which impede ?</l>
     <l n="1421">Is this the evil portent of the birds ?</l>
     <l n="1422">Were the stars adverse ? or what else hath fall'n ? ”</l>
     <l n="1423">And others said , wailing for friends and goods :—</l>
     <l n="1424">“ Who was that woman , with mad eyes , that came</l>
     <l n="1425">Into our camp , ill-favored , hardly cast</l>
     <l n="1426">In mortal mould ? By her , be sure , was wrought</l>
     <l n="1427">This direful sorcery . Demon or witch ,</l>
     <l n="1428">Yakshî or Rakshasî , or gliding ghost ,</l>
     <l n="1429">Or something frightful , was she . Hers this deed</l>
     <l n="1430">Of midnight murders ; doubt there can be none .</l>
     <l n="1431">Ah , if we could espy that hateful one ,</l>
     <l n="1432">The ruin of our march , the woe-maker ,</l>
     <l n="1433">With stones , clods , canes , or clubs , nay , with clenched fists ,</l>
     <l n="1434">We 'd strike her dead , the murderess of our band ! ”</l>
     <l n="1435">Trembling the Princess heard those angry words ;</l>
     <l n="1436">And — saddened , maddened , shamed — breathless she fled</l>
     <l n="1437">Into the thicket , doubtful if such sin</l>
     <l n="1438">Might not be hers , and with fresh dread distressed .</l>
     <l n="1439">“ Aho ! ” she weeps , “ pitiless grows the wrath</l>
     <l n="1440">Of Fate against me . Not one gleam of good</l>
     <l n="1441">Arriveth . Of what fault is this the fruit ?</l>
     <l n="1442">I cannot call to mind a wrong I wrought</l>
     <l n="1443">To any — even a little thing — in act</l>
     <l n="1444">Or thought or word ; whence then hath come this curse ?</l>
     <l n="1445">Belike from ill deeds done in by-gone lives</l>
     <l n="1446">It hath befall'n , and what I suffer now</l>
     <l n="1447">Is payment of old evils undischarged .</l>
     <l n="1448">Grievous the doom — my palace lost , my lord ,</l>
     <l n="1449">My children , kindred ; I am torn away</l>
     <l n="1450">From home and love and all , to roam accurst</l>
     <l n="1451">In this plague-haunted waste ! ”</l>
     <l n="1452">When broke the day ,</l>
     <l n="1453">Those which escaped alive , with grievous cries</l>
     <l n="1454">Departed , mourning for their fellows slain .</l>
     <l n="1455">Each one a kinsman or a friend laments —</l>
     <l n="1456">Father or brother , son , or comrade dear .</l>
     <l n="1457">And Damayanti , hearing , weeps anew ,</l>
     <l n="1458">Saying : “ What dreadful sin was that I wrought</l>
     <l n="1459">Long , long ago , which , when I chance to meet</l>
     <l n="1460">These wayfarers in the unpeopled wood ,</l>
     <l n="1461">Dooms them to perish by the elephants ,</l>
     <l n="1462">In my dark destiny enwrapped ? No doubt</l>
     <l n="1463">More and more sorrow I shall bear , or bring ,</l>
     <l n="1464">For none dies ere his time ; this is the lore</l>
     <l n="1465">Of ancient sages ; this is why — being glad</l>
     <l n="1466">If I could die — I was not trampled down</l>
     <l n="1467">Under the elephants . There haps to man</l>
     <l n="1468">Nothing unless by destiny . Why else ,</l>
     <l n="1469">Seeing that never have I wrought one wrong ,</l>
     <l n="1470">From childhood 's hours , in thought or word or deed ,</l>
     <l n="1471">Hath this woe chanced ? May be — meseems it may !—</l>
     <l n="1472">The mighty gods , at my Swayamvara</l>
     <l n="1473">Slighted by me for Nala 's dearest sake ,</l>
     <l n="1474">Are wroth , and by their dread displeasure thus</l>
     <l n="1475">To loss and loneliness I am consigned ! ”</l>
     <l n="1476">So — woe-begone and wild — this noble wife ,</l>
     <l n="1477">Deserted Damayanti , poured her griefs :</l>
     <l n="1478">And afterwards , with certain Bráhmanas</l>
     <l n="1479">Saved from the rout — good men who knew the Veds —</l>
     <l n="1480">Sadly her road she finished , like the moon</l>
     <l n="1481">That goeth clouded in the month of rain .</l>
     <l n="1482">Thus travelling long , the Princess drew at last</l>
     <l n="1483">Nigh to a city , at the evening hour .</l>
     <l n="1484">The dwelling-place it was of Chedi 's Chief ,</l>
     <l n="1485">The just Subâhu . Through its lofty gates</l>
     <l n="1486">Painfully passed she , clad in half a cloth ;</l>
     <l n="1487">And as she entered — sorrow-stricken , wan ,</l>
     <l n="1488">Foot-weary , stained with mire , with unsmoothed hair ,</l>
     <l n="1489">Unbathed , and eyes of madness — those who saw ,</l>
     <l n="1490">Wondered and stared , and watched her as she toiled</l>
     <l n="1491">Down the long city street . The children break</l>
     <l n="1492">From play , and — boys with girls — followed her steps ,</l>
     <l n="1493">So that she came — a crowd encompassing —</l>
     <l n="1494">Unto the King 's door . On the palace roof</l>
     <l n="1495">The mother of the Maharaja paced ,</l>
     <l n="1496">And marked the throng , and that sad wayfarer .</l>
     <l n="1497">Then to her nurse spake the queen-mother this :—</l>
     <l n="1498">“ Go thou , and bring yon woman unto me !</l>
     <l n="1499">The people trouble her ; mournful she walks ,</l>
     <l n="1500">Seeming unfriended , yet bears she a mien</l>
     <l n="1501">Made for a king 's abode , and , all so wild ,</l>
     <l n="1502">Still are her wistful eyes like the great eyes</l>
     <l n="1503">Of Lakshmi 's self . ” So downwards went the nurse ,</l>
     <l n="1504">Bidding the rude folk back ; and to the roof</l>
     <l n="1505">Of the great palace led that wandering one —</l>
     <l n="1506">Desolate Damayanti — whom the Queen</l>
     <l n="1507">Courteous besought : “ Though thou art wan of face ,</l>
     <l n="1508">Thou wear'st a noble air , which through thy griefs</l>
     <l n="1509">Shineth as lightning doth behind its cloud .</l>
     <l n="1510">Tell me thy name , and whose thou art , and whence .</l>
     <l n="1511">No lowborn form is thine , albeit thou com'st</l>
     <l n="1512">Wearing no ornaments ; and all alone</l>
     <l n="1513">Wanderest — not fearing men — by some spell safe . ”</l>
     <l n="1514">Hearing which words , the child of Bhima spake</l>
     <l n="1515">Gratefully this : “ A woful woman I ,</l>
     <l n="1516">And woful wife , but faithful to my vows ;</l>
     <l n="1517">High-born , but like a servant , like a slave ,</l>
     <l n="1518">Lodging where it may hap , and finding food</l>
     <l n="1519">From the wild roots and fruits wherever night</l>
     <l n="1520">Brings me my resting-place . Yet is my lord</l>
     <l n="1521">A prince noble and great , with countless gifts</l>
     <l n="1522">Endued ; and him I followed faithfully</l>
     <l n="1523">As ‘ t were his shadow , till hard fate decreed</l>
     <l n="1524">That he should fall into the rage of dice :—</l>
     <l n="1525">And , worsted in that play , into the wood</l>
     <l n="1526">He fled , clad in one cloth , frenzied and lone .</l>
     <l n="1527">And I his steps attended in the wood ,</l>
     <l n="1528">Comforting him , my husband . But it chanced ,</l>
     <l n="1529">Hungry and desperate , he lost his cloth ;</l>
     <l n="1530">And I — one garment bearing — followed still</l>
     <l n="1531">My unclad lord , despairing , reasonless ,</l>
     <l n="1532">Through many a weary night not slumbering .</l>
     <l n="1533">But when , at length , a little while I slept ,</l>
     <l n="1534">My Prince abandoned me , rending away</l>
     <l n="1535">Half of my garment , leaving there his wife ,</l>
     <l n="1536">Who never wrought him wrong . That lord I seek</l>
     <l n="1537">By day and night , with heart and soul on fire —</l>
     <l n="1538">Seek , but still find not ; though he is to me</l>
     <l n="1539">Brighter than light which gleams from lotus-cups ,</l>
     <l n="1540">Divine as are the immortals , dear as breath ,</l>
     <l n="1541">The master of my life , my pride , my joy ! ”</l>
     <l n="1542">Whom , grieving so , her sweet eyes blind with tears ,</l>
     <l n="1543">Gently addressed Subâhu 's mother — sad</l>
     <l n="1544">To hear as she to tell . “ Stay with us here ,</l>
     <l n="1545">Thou ill-starred lady . Great the friendliness</l>
     <l n="1546">I have for thee . The people of our court</l>
     <l n="1547">Shall thy lost husband seek ; or , it may be ,</l>
     <l n="1548">He too will wander hither of himself</l>
     <l n="1549">By devious paths : yea , mournful one , thy lord</l>
     <l n="1550">Thou wilt regain , abiding with us here . ”</l>
     <l n="1551">And Damayanti , bowing , answered thus</l>
     <l n="1552">Unto the Queen : “ I will abide with thee ,</l>
     <l n="1553">O mother of illustrious sons , if so</l>
     <l n="1554">They feed me not on orts , nor seek from me</l>
     <l n="1555">To wash the feet of comers , nor that I</l>
     <l n="1556">Be set to speak with any stranger-men</l>
     <l n="1557">Before the curtain ; and , if any man</l>
     <l n="1558">Sue me , that he be punished ; and if twice ,</l>
     <l n="1559">Then that he die , guilty of infamy .</l>
     <l n="1560">This is my earnest prayer ; but Bráhmanas</l>
     <l n="1561">Who seek my husband , or bear news of him ,</l>
     <l n="1562">Such will I speak with . If it may be thus ,</l>
     <l n="1563">Gladly would I abide , great lady , here ;</l>
     <l n="1564">If otherwise , it is not on my mind</l>
     <l n="1565">To sojourn longer . ”</l>
     <l n="1566">Very tenderly</l>
     <l n="1567">Quoth the queen-mother : “ All that thou dost ask</l>
     <l n="1568">We will ordain . The gods reward thy love ,</l>
     <l n="1569">Which hath such honor ! ” Comforting her so ,</l>
     <l n="1570">To the king 's daughter , young Sunandâ , spake</l>
     <l n="1571">The Maharajni : “ See , Sunandâ , here</l>
     <l n="1572">Clad as a handmaid , but in form divine ,</l>
     <l n="1573">One of thy years , gentle and true . Be friends ;</l>
     <l n="1574">Take and give pleasure in glad company</l>
     <l n="1575">Each with the other , keeping happy hearts . ”</l>
     <l n="1576">So went Sunandâ joyous to her house ,</l>
     <l n="1577">Leading with loving hand the Princess in ,</l>
     <l n="1578">The maidens of the court accompanying .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="1579">Part II .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="1580">Not long ( O Maharaja ! ) was Nala fled</l>
     <l n="1581">From Damayanti , when , in midmost gloom</l>
     <l n="1582">Of the thick wood a flaming fire he spied ,</l>
     <l n="1583">And from the fire 's heart heard proceed a voice</l>
     <l n="1584">Of one imperilled , crying many times :—</l>
     <l n="1585">“ Haste hither , Punyashloka , Nala , haste ! ”</l>
     <l n="1586">“ Fear not , ” the Prince replied ; “ I come ! ” and sprang</l>
     <l n="1587">Across the burning bushes , where he saw</l>
     <l n="1588">A snake — a king of serpents — lying curled</l>
     <l n="1589">In a great ring , which reared its dancing crest</l>
     <l n="1590">Saluting , and in human accents spoke :—</l>
     <l n="1591">“ Maharaja , kindly lord , I am the snake</l>
     <l n="1592">Karkôtaka ; by me was once betrayed</l>
     <l n="1593">The famous Rishi Narada ; his wrath</l>
     <l n="1594">Doomed me , thou Chief of men ! to bear this spell —</l>
     <l n="1595">‘ Coil thy false folds , ’ said he , ‘ forever here ,</l>
     <l n="1596">A serpent , motionless upon this spot ,</l>
     <l n="1597">Till it shall chance that Nala passeth by</l>
     <l n="1598">And bears thee hence ; then only from my curse</l>
     <l n="1599">Canst thou be freed , ’ And prisoned by that curse</l>
     <l n="1600">I have no power to stir , though the wood burns ;</l>
     <l n="1601">Nay , not a coil ! good fellowship I 'll show</l>
     <l n="1602">If thou wilt succor me . I 'll be to thee</l>
     <l n="1603">A faithful friend , as no snake ever yet .</l>
     <l n="1604">Lift me , and quickly from the flames bear forth :</l>
     <l n="1605">For thee I shall grow light . ” Thereat shrank up</l>
     <l n="1606">That monstrous reptile to a finger 's length ;</l>
     <l n="1607">And grasping this , unto a place secure</l>
     <l n="1608">From burning , Nala bore it , where the air</l>
     <l n="1609">Breathed freshly , and the fire 's black path was stayed .</l>
     <l n="1610">Then made the Prince to lay the serpent down ,</l>
     <l n="1611">But yet again it speaks : “ Nishadha 's Lord ,</l>
     <l n="1612">Grasp me and slowly go , counting thy steps ;</l>
     <l n="1613">For , Raja , thou shalt have good fortune hence . ”</l>
     <l n="1614">So Nala slowly went , counting his steps ;</l>
     <l n="1615">And when the tenth pace came , the serpent turned</l>
     <l n="1616">And bit the Prince . No sooner pierced that tooth</l>
     <l n="1617">Than all the likeness of Nishadha changed ;</l>
     <l n="1618">And , wonder-struck , he gazed upon himself ;</l>
     <l n="1619">While from the dust he saw the snake arise</l>
     <l n="1620">A man , and , speaking as Karkôtaka ,</l>
     <l n="1621">Comfort him thus :—</l>
     <l n="1622">“ Thou art by me transformed</l>
     <l n="1623">That no man know thee : and that evil one</l>
     <l n="1624">( Possessing , and undoing thee , with grief )</l>
     <l n="1625">Shall so within thee by my venom smart ,</l>
     <l n="1626">Shall through thy blood so ache , that — till he quit —</l>
     <l n="1627">He shall endure the woe he did impart .</l>
     <l n="1628">Thus by my potent spell , most noble Prince !</l>
     <l n="1629">( Who sufferest too long ) thou wilt be freed</l>
     <l n="1630">From him that haunts thee . Fear no more the wood ,</l>
     <l n="1631">Thou tiger of all princes ! fear thou not</l>
     <l n="1632">Horned nor fanged beasts , nor any enemies ,</l>
     <l n="1633">Though they be Bráhmans ! safe thou goest now ,</l>
     <l n="1634">Guarded from grief and hurt — Chieftain of men !</l>
     <l n="1635">By this kind poison . In the fields of war</l>
     <l n="1636">Henceforth the victory always falls to thee ;</l>
     <l n="1637">Go joyous , therefore , Prince ; give thyself forth</l>
     <l n="1638">For ‘ Vahûka , the charioteer : ’ repair</l>
     <l n="1639">To Rituparna 's city , who is skilled</l>
     <l n="1640">In play , and dwells in fair Ayodhyâ .</l>
     <l n="1641">Wend thou , Nishadha ! thither ; he will teach</l>
     <l n="1642">Great subtlety in numbers unto thee ,</l>
     <l n="1643">Exchanging this for thine own matchless gift</l>
     <l n="1644">Of taming horses . From the lordly line</l>
     <l n="1645">Descended of Ikshvaku , glad and kind</l>
     <l n="1646">The King will be ; and thou , learning of him</l>
     <l n="1647">His deepest act of dice , wilt win back all ,</l>
     <l n="1648">And clasp again thy Princess . Therefore waste</l>
     <l n="1649">No thought on woes . I tell thee truth ! thy realm</l>
     <l n="1650">Thou shalt regain ; and when the time is come</l>
     <l n="1651">That thou hast need to put thine own form on ,</l>
     <l n="1652">Call me to mind , O Prince , and tie this cloth</l>
     <l n="1653">Around thy body . Wearing it , thy shape</l>
     <l n="1654">Thou shalt resume . ”</l>
     <l n="1655">Therewith the serpent gave</l>
     <l n="1656">A magic twofold robe , not wove on earth ,</l>
     <l n="1657">Which ( O thou son of Kuru ! ) Nala took ;</l>
     <l n="1658">And so the snake , transformed , vanished away .</l>
     <l n="1659">The great snake being gone , Nishadha 's Chief</l>
     <l n="1660">Set forth , and on the tenth day entered in</l>
     <l n="1661">At Rituparna 's town ; there he besought</l>
     <l n="1662">The presence of the Raja , and spake thus :—</l>
     <l n="1663">“ I am the chariot-driver , Vahûka .</l>
     <l n="1664">There is not on this earth another man</l>
     <l n="1665">Hath gifts like mine to tame and guide the steed ;</l>
     <l n="1666">Moreover , thou mayest use me in nice needs</l>
     <l n="1667">And dangerous , where kings lack faithful hearts .</l>
     <l n="1668">Specially skilful I am in dressing meats ;</l>
     <l n="1669">And whatso other duties may befall ,</l>
     <l n="1670">Though they be weighty , I shall execute ,</l>
     <l n="1671">If , Rituparna , thou wilt take me in . ”</l>
     <l n="1672">“ I take thee , ” quoth the King . “ Dwell here with me .</l>
     <l n="1673">Such service as thou knowest , render us .</l>
     <l n="1674">‘ Tis , Vahûka , forever in my heart</l>
     <l n="1675">To have my steeds the swiftest ; be thy task</l>
     <l n="1676">To train me horses like the wind for speed ;</l>
     <l n="1677">My charioteer I make thee , and thy wage</l>
     <l n="1678">Ten thousand gold suvernas . Thou wilt have</l>
     <l n="1679">For fellows , Varshneya and Jivala ;</l>
     <l n="1680">With those abiding , lodge thou happy here . ”</l>
     <l n="1681">So entertained and honored of the King ,</l>
     <l n="1682">In Rituparna 's city Nala dwelled ,</l>
     <l n="1683">Lodging with Varshneya and Jivala .</l>
     <l n="1684">There sojourned he ( my Raja ! ) , thinking still</l>
     <l n="1685">Of sweet Vidarbha 's Princess day by day ;</l>
     <l n="1686">And sunset after sunset one sad strain</l>
     <l n="1687">He sang : “ Where resteth she that roamed the wood</l>
     <l n="1688">Hungry and parched and worn , but always true ?</l>
     <l n="1689">Doth she remember yet her faultful lord ?</l>
     <l n="1690">Ah , who is near her now ? ” So it befell</l>
     <l n="1691">Jivala heard him ever sighing thus ,</l>
     <l n="1692">And questioned : “ Who is she thou dost lament ?</l>
     <l n="1693">Say , Vahûka ! fain would I know her name .</l>
     <l n="1694">Long life be thine ; but tell me who he is ,</l>
     <l n="1695">The faultful man that was the lady 's lord . ”</l>
     <l n="1696">And Nala answered him : “ There lives a man ,</l>
     <l n="1697">Evil and rash , that had a noble wife .</l>
     <l n="1698">False to his word he was ; and thus it fell</l>
     <l n="1699">That somewhere , for some reason ( ask not me ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="1700">He quitted her , this rash one . And — so wrenched</l>
     <l n="1701">Apart from hers — his spirit , bad and sad ,</l>
     <l n="1702">Muses and moans , with grief 's slow fire consumed</l>
     <l n="1703">Night-time and day-time . Thence it is he sings</l>
     <l n="1704">At every sunset this unchanging verse ,</l>
     <l n="1705">An outcast on the earth , by hazard led</l>
     <l n="1706">Hither and thither . Such a man thou seest</l>
     <l n="1707">Woful , unworthy , holding in his heart</l>
     <l n="1708">Always that sin . I was that lady 's lord ,</l>
     <l n="1709">Whom she did follow through the dreadful wood ,</l>
     <l n="1710">Living by me abandoned , at this hour ;</l>
     <l n="1711">If yet , in truth , she lives — youthful , alone ,</l>
     <l n="1712">Unpractised in the ways , not meriting</l>
     <l n="1713">Fortunes so hard . Ah , if indeed she lives ,</l>
     <l n="1714">Who roamed the thick and boundless forest , full</l>
     <l n="1715">Of prowling beasts — roamed it , my Jivala ,</l>
     <l n="1716">Unguarded by her guilty lord — forsook ,</l>
     <l n="1717">Betrayed , good friend ! ”</l>
     <l n="1718">Thus did Nishadha grieve ,</l>
     <l n="1719">Calling sweet Damayanti to his mind .</l>
     <l n="1720">So tarried he within the Raja 's house ,</l>
     <l n="1721">And no man knew his place of sojourning .</l>
     <l n="1722">While , stripped of state , the Prince and Princess thus</l>
     <l n="1723">Were sunk to servitude , Bhima made quest ,</l>
     <l n="1724">Sending his Bráhmans forth to search for them</l>
     <l n="1725">With straight commands , and for their road-money</l>
     <l n="1726">Liberal store . “ Seek everywhere , ” said he</l>
     <l n="1727">Unto the twice-born , “ Nala — everywhere</l>
     <l n="1728">My daughter Damayanti . Whoso comes</l>
     <l n="1729">Successful in this quest , discovering her —</l>
     <l n="1730">With lost Nishadha 's Lord — and bringing them ,</l>
     <l n="1731">A thousand cows to that man will I give ,</l>
     <l n="1732">And village-lands whence shall be revenue</l>
     <l n="1733">As great as from a city . If so be</l>
     <l n="1734">Ye cannot bring me Nala and my child ,</l>
     <l n="1735">To him that learns their refuge I will give</l>
     <l n="1736">The thousand cows . ”</l>
     <l n="1737">Thereby rejoiced , they went ,</l>
     <l n="1738">Those Bráhmans , hither and thither , up and down ,</l>
     <l n="1739">Into all regions , rajaships , and towns ,</l>
     <l n="1740">Seeking Nishadha 's Chieftain , and his wife .</l>
     <l n="1741">But Nala nowhere found they ; nowhere found</l>
     <l n="1742">Sweet Damayanti , Bhima 's beauteous child —</l>
     <l n="1743">Until , straying to pleasant Chedipur ,</l>
     <l n="1744">One day a twice-born came , Sudêva named ,</l>
     <l n="1745">And entered it ; and , spying round about</l>
     <l n="1746">( Upon a feast-day by the King proclaimed ) ,</l>
     <l n="1747">He saw forth-passing through the palace gate</l>
     <l n="1748">A woman — Bhima 's daughter — side by side</l>
     <l n="1749">With young Sunandâ . Little praise had now</l>
     <l n="1750">That beauty which in old days shone so bright ;</l>
     <l n="1751">Marred with much grief it was , like sunlight dimmed</l>
     <l n="1752">By fold on fold of wreathed and creeping mists .</l>
     <l n="1753">But when Sudêva marked the great dark eyes —</l>
     <l n="1754">Lustreless though they were , and she so worn ,</l>
     <l n="1755">So listless — “ Lo , the Princess ! ” whispered he ;—</l>
     <l n="1756">“ ‘ Tis the King 's daughter , ” quoth he to himself ;</l>
     <l n="1757">And thus mused on :—</l>
     <l n="1758">“ Yea ! as I used to see ,</l>
     <l n="1759">‘ Tis she ! no other woman hath such grace !</l>
     <l n="1760">My task is done ; I gaze on that one form ,</l>
     <l n="1761">Which is like Lakshmi 's , whom all worlds adore .</l>
     <l n="1762">I see the bosoms , rounded , dark , and smooth ,</l>
     <l n="1763">As they were sister-moons ; the soft moon-face</l>
     <l n="1764">Which with its queenly light makes all things bright</l>
     <l n="1765">Where it doth gleam ; the large deep lotus-eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1766">That , like to Rati 's own , the Queen of Love ,</l>
     <l n="1767">Beam , each a lovelit star , filling the worlds</l>
     <l n="1768">With longing . Ah , fair lotus-flower , plucked up</l>
     <l n="1769">By Fate 's hard grasp from far Vidarbha 's pool ,</l>
     <l n="1770">How is thy cup muddied and slimed to-day !</l>
     <l n="1771">Ah , moon , how is thy night like to the eclipse</l>
     <l n="1772">When Rahu swallows up the silver round !</l>
     <l n="1773">Ah , tearless eyes , reddened with weeping him ,</l>
     <l n="1774">How are ye like to gentle streams run dry !</l>
     <l n="1775">Ah , lake of lilies , where grief 's elephant</l>
     <l n="1776">Hath swung his trunk , and turned the crystal black ,</l>
     <l n="1777">And scattered all the blue and crimson cups ,</l>
     <l n="1778">And frightened off the birds ! Ah , lily-cup ,</l>
     <l n="1779">Tender , and delicately leaved , and reared</l>
     <l n="1780">To blossom in a palace built of gems ,</l>
     <l n="1781">How dost thou wither here , wrenched by the root ,</l>
     <l n="1782">Sun-scorched and faded ! Noblest , loveliest , best !—</l>
     <l n="1783">Who bear'st no gems , yet so becomest them —</l>
     <l n="1784">How like the new moon 's silver horn thou art ,</l>
     <l n="1785">When envious black clouds blot it ! Lost for thee</l>
     <l n="1786">Are love , home , children , friends , and kinsmen ; lost</l>
     <l n="1787">All joy of that fair body thou dost wear</l>
     <l n="1788">Only that it may last to find thy lord .</l>
     <l n="1789">Truly a woman 's ornament is this :—</l>
     <l n="1790">The husband is her jewel ; lacking him</l>
     <l n="1791">She hath none , though she shines with priceless pearls ;</l>
     <l n="1792">Piteous must be her state ! And , torn from her ,</l>
     <l n="1793">Doth Nala cling to life ; or , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="1794">Waste with long yearning ? Oh , as I behold</l>
     <l n="1795">Those black locks , and those eyes — dark and long-shaped</l>
     <l n="1796">As are the hundred-petalled lotus-leaves —</l>
     <l n="1797">And watch her joyless who deserves all joy ,</l>
     <l n="1798">My heart is sore ! When will she overpass</l>
     <l n="1799">The river of this sorrow , and come safe</l>
     <l n="1800">Unto its farther shore ? When will she meet</l>
     <l n="1801">Her lord , as moon and moon-star in the sky</l>
     <l n="1802">Mingle ? For , as I think , in winning her ,</l>
     <l n="1803">Nala would win his happy days again ,</l>
     <l n="1804">And — albeit banished now — have back his lands .</l>
     <l n="1805">Alike in years and graces , and alike</l>
     <l n="1806">In lordly race these were : no bride could seem</l>
     <l n="1807">Worthy Nishadha , if it were not she ;</l>
     <l n="1808">Nor husband worthy of Vidarbha 's Pride ,</l>
     <l n="1809">Save it were Nala . It is meet I bring</l>
     <l n="1810">Comfort forthwith to yon despairing one ,</l>
     <l n="1811">The consort of the just and noble Prince ,</l>
     <l n="1812">For whom I see her heart-sick . I will go</l>
     <l n="1813">And speak good tidings to this moon-faced Queen ,</l>
     <l n="1814">Who once knew nought of sorrows , but to-day</l>
     <l n="1815">Stands yonder , plunged heart-deep in woful thought . ”</l>
     <l n="1816">So , all those signs and marks considering</l>
     <l n="1817">Which stamped her Bhima 's child , Sudêva drew</l>
     <l n="1818">Nearer , and said : “ Vidarbhi , Nala 's wife ,</l>
     <l n="1819">I am the Bráhmana Sudêva , friend</l>
     <l n="1820">Unto my lord , thy brother , and I come</l>
     <l n="1821">By royal Bhima 's mandate , seeking thee .</l>
     <l n="1822">That Maharaja , thy father , dwells in health ;</l>
     <l n="1823">Thy mother and thy house are well ; and well —</l>
     <l n="1824">With promise of long years — thy little ones ,</l>
     <l n="1825">Sister and brother . Yet , for thy sake , Queen ,</l>
     <l n="1826">Thy kindred sit as men with spirit gone ;</l>
     <l n="1827">In search of thee a hundred twice-born rove</l>
     <l n="1828">Over all lands . ”</l>
     <l n="1829">But ( O King Yudhisthir ! )</l>
     <l n="1830">Hardly one word she heard before she broke</l>
     <l n="1831">With question after question on the man ,</l>
     <l n="1832">Asking of this dear friend and that and this ;</l>
     <l n="1833">All mingled with quick tears , and tender sighs ,</l>
     <l n="1834">And hungry gazing on her brother 's friend ,</l>
     <l n="1835">Sudêva — best of Bráhmanas — come there .</l>
     <l n="1836">Which soon Sunandâ marked , watching them speak</l>
     <l n="1837">Apart , and Damayanti all in tears .</l>
     <l n="1838">Then came she to her mother , saying : “ See ,</l>
     <l n="1839">The handmaid thou didst give me talks below</l>
     <l n="1840">With one who is a Bráhman , all her words</l>
     <l n="1841">Watered with weeping ; if thou wilt , demand</l>
     <l n="1842">What this man knows . ”</l>
     <l n="1843">Therewith swept forth amazed</l>
     <l n="1844">The mother of the Raja , and beheld</l>
     <l n="1845">How Nala 's wife spake with the Bráhmana .</l>
     <l n="1846">Whom straight she bade them summon ; and , being brought ,</l>
     <l n="1847">In this wise questioned : “ Knowest thou whose wife ,</l>
     <l n="1848">Whose daughter , this one is ; and how she left</l>
     <l n="1849">Her kin ; and wherefore , being heavenly-eyed</l>
     <l n="1850">And noble-mannered , she hath wandered here ?</l>
     <l n="1851">I am full fain to hear this ; tell me all ,</l>
     <l n="1852">No whit withholding ; answer faithfully —</l>
     <l n="1853">Who is our slave-girl with the goddess gait ? ”</l>
     <l n="1854">The Bráhmana Sudêva , so addressed ,</l>
     <l n="1855">Seating himself at ease , unto the Queen</l>
     <l n="1856">Told Damayanti 's story , how all fell .</l>
     <l n="1857">Sudêva said : “ There reigns in majesty</l>
     <l n="1858">King Bhima at Vidarbha ; and of him</l>
     <l n="1859">The Princess Damayanti here is child ;</l>
     <l n="1860">And Virasena 's son , Nala , is Lord</l>
     <l n="1861">Over Nishadha , praised-in-song and wise ;</l>
     <l n="1862">And of that Prince this lady is the wife .</l>
     <l n="1863">In play his brother worsted Nala — stripped</l>
     <l n="1864">Of lands and wealth the Prince ; who fled his realm ,</l>
     <l n="1865">Wandering with Damayanti — where , none knew .</l>
     <l n="1866">In quest of Damayanti we have roamed</l>
     <l n="1867">The earth 's face o'er , until I found her here</l>
     <l n="1868">In thy son 's house , the King 's — the very same ,</l>
     <l n="1869">Since like to her for grace no woman lives</l>
     <l n="1870">Of all fair women . Where her eyebrows meet</l>
     <l n="1871">A pretty mole , born with her , should be seen</l>
     <l n="1872">A little lotus-bud — not visible</l>
     <l n="1873">By reason of the dust of toil which clouds</l>
     <l n="1874">Her face and veils its moon-like beauty — that</l>
     <l n="1875">The wondrous Maker on the rare work stamped</l>
     <l n="1876">To be His Mark . But as the waxing moon</l>
     <l n="1877">Goes thin and darkling for awhile , then rounds</l>
     <l n="1878">The crescent 's rims with splendors , so this Queen</l>
     <l n="1879">Hath lost not queenliness . Being now obscured ,</l>
     <l n="1880">Soiled with the grime of chores , unbeautified ,</l>
     <l n="1881">She shows true gold . The fire which trieth gold</l>
     <l n="1882">Denoteth less itself by instant heat</l>
     <l n="1883">Than Damayanti by her goodlihood .</l>
     <l n="1884">As first sight knew I her . She bears that mole . ”</l>
     <l n="1885">Whilst yet Sudêva spake ( O King of men ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="1886">Sunandâ from the slave 's front washed away</l>
     <l n="1887">The gathered dust , and forth that mark appeared</l>
     <l n="1888">‘ Twixt Damayanti 's brows , as when clouds break ,</l>
     <l n="1889">And in the sky the moon , the night-maker ,</l>
     <l n="1890">Glitters to view . Seeing the spot awhile ,</l>
     <l n="1891">Sunandâ and the mother of the King</l>
     <l n="1892">Gazed voiceless ; then they clasped her neck and wept</l>
     <l n="1893">Rejoicing , till the Queen , staying her tears ,</l>
     <l n="1894">Exclaimed : “ My sister 's daughter , dear ! thou art ,</l>
     <l n="1895">By this same mark . Thy mother and myself</l>
     <l n="1896">Were sisters by one father — he that rules</l>
     <l n="1897">Daśarna , King Sudâman . She was given</l>
     <l n="1898">To Bhima , and to Virabahu I .</l>
     <l n="1899">Once at Daśarna , in my father 's house ,</l>
     <l n="1900">I saw thee , newly born . Thy race and mine ,</l>
     <l n="1901">Princess , are one : henceforward , therefore , here</l>
     <l n="1902">As I am , Damayanti , shalt thou be . ”</l>
     <l n="1903">With gladdened heart did Damayanti bend</l>
     <l n="1904">Before her mother 's sister , answering thus :—</l>
     <l n="1905">“ Peaceful and thankful dwelled I here with thee ,</l>
     <l n="1906">Being unknown , my every need supplied ,</l>
     <l n="1907">My life and honor by thy succor safe ,</l>
     <l n="1908">Yet , Maharajni , even than this dear home</l>
     <l n="1909">One would be dearer : ‘ tis so many days</l>
     <l n="1910">Since we were parted . Suffer me to go</l>
     <l n="1911">Where those my tender little ones were led ;</l>
     <l n="1912">So long — poor babes !— of me and of their sire</l>
     <l n="1913">Bereft . If , lady , thou dost think to show</l>
     <l n="1914">Kindness to me , this is my wish : to wend</l>
     <l n="1915">Unto Vidarbha swiftly ; wilt thou bid</l>
     <l n="1916">They bear me thither ? ”</l>
     <l n="1917">Was no sooner heard</l>
     <l n="1918">That fond desire , than the queen-mother gave</l>
     <l n="1919">Willing command ; and soon an ample troop ,</l>
     <l n="1920">The King consenting , gathered for her guard .</l>
     <l n="1921">So was she sent upon a palanquin ,</l>
     <l n="1922">With soldiers , pole-bearers , and meat and drink ,</l>
     <l n="1923">And garments as befitted — happier — home .</l>
     <l n="1924">Thus to Vidarbha came its Pride again ,</l>
     <l n="1925">By no long road ; and joyously her kin</l>
     <l n="1926">Brought the sweet Princess in , and welcomed her .</l>
     <l n="1927">In peace and safety all her house she found ;</l>
     <l n="1928">Her children well ;— father and mother , friends .</l>
     <l n="1929">The gods she worshipped , and to Bráhmanas</l>
     <l n="1930">Due reverence made , and whatso else was meet</l>
     <l n="1931">That Damayanti did , regal in all .</l>
     <l n="1932">To wise Sudêva fell the thousand cows</l>
     <l n="1933">By Bhima granted , with the village-lands ,</l>
     <l n="1934">And goodly gifts beside .</l>
     <l n="1935">But when there passed</l>
     <l n="1936">One night of rest within the palace-walls ,</l>
     <l n="1937">The wistful Princess to her mother said :—</l>
     <l n="1938">“ If thou wouldst have me live , I tell thee true ,</l>
     <l n="1939">Dear mother , it must be by bringing back</l>
     <l n="1940">My Nala , my own lord ; and only so . ”</l>
     <l n="1941">When this she spake , right sorrowful became</l>
     <l n="1942">The Rani , weeping silently , nor gave</l>
     <l n="1943">One word of answer ; and the palace-girls ,</l>
     <l n="1944">Seeing this grief , sat round them , weeping too ,</l>
     <l n="1945">And crying : “ Haha ! where is gone her lord ? ”</l>
     <l n="1946">And loud the lamentation was of all .</l>
     <l n="1947">Afterwards to the Maharaja his Queen</l>
     <l n="1948">Told what was said : “ Lord ! all uncomforted</l>
     <l n="1949">Thy daughter Damayanti weeps and grieves ,</l>
     <l n="1950">Lacking her husband . Even to me she spake</l>
     <l n="1951">Before our damsels , laying shame aside :—</l>
     <l n="1952">‘ Find Nala ; let the people of the court</l>
     <l n="1953">Strive day and night to learn where Nala is . ’ ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="1954">Then Bhima , hearing , called his Bráhmanas</l>
     <l n="1955">Patient and wise , and issued hest to go</l>
     <l n="1956">Into all regions , seeking for the Prince .</l>
     <l n="1957">But first , by mandate of the Maharaja ,</l>
     <l n="1958">To Damayanti all those twice-born came ,</l>
     <l n="1959">Saying : “ Now we depart ! ” Then Bhima 's child</l>

     <l n="2054">But first Parnâda , resting from his road —</l>
     <l n="2055">That best of twice-borns — did the Princess thank</l>
     <l n="2056">With honorable words and gifts : “ If home</l>
     <l n="2057">My Nala cometh , Bráhman ! ” so she spake ,</l>
     <l n="2058">“ Great guerdon will I give . Thou hast well done</l>
     <l n="2059">For me herein — -  better than any man ;</l>
     <l n="2060">Helping me find again my wandered lord . ”</l>
     <l n="2061">To which fair words made soft reply , and prayers</l>
     <l n="2062">For “ peace and fortune , ” that high-minded one ,</l>
     <l n="2063">And so passed home , his service being wrought .</l>
     <l n="2064">Next to Sudêva spake the sad Princess</l>
     <l n="2065">This ( O my King ! ) , her mother standing by :—</l>
     <l n="2066">“ Good Bráhman , to Ayodhyâ 's city go .</l>
     <l n="2067">Say in the ears of Raja Rituparna ,</l>
     <l n="2068">As though thou cam'st a simple traveller ,</l>

     <l n="2078">These the words which he should say ;</l>
     <l n="2079">And , learning them , he sped , and thither came —</l>
     <l n="2080">That Bráhmana Sudêva — and he spake</l>
     <l n="2081">To Maharaja Rituparna so .</l>
     <l n="2082">Now when the Raja Rituparna heard</l>
     <l n="2083">Sudêva 's words , quoth he to Vahûka</l>
     <l n="2084">Full pleasantly : “ Much mind I have to go</l>
     <l n="2085">Where Damayanti holds Swayamvara ,</l>
     <l n="2086">If to Vidarbha , in a single day ,</l>
     <l n="2087">Thou deemest we might drive , my charioteer ! ”</l>
     <l n="2088">Of Nala , by his Raja thus addressed ,</l>
     <l n="2089">Torn was the heart with anguish ; for he thought :—</l>
     <l n="2090">“ Can Damayanti purpose this ? Could grief</l>
     <l n="2091">So change her ? Is it not some fine device</l>
     <l n="2092">For my sake schemed ? Or doth my Princess seek ,</l>
     <l n="2093">All holy as she was , this guilty joy ,</l>
     <l n="2094">Being so wronged of me , her rash weak lord ?</l>
     <l n="2095">Frail is a woman 's heart , and my fault great !</l>
     <l n="2096">Thus might she do it , being far from home ,</l>
     <l n="2097">Bereft of friends , desolate with long woes</l>
     <l n="2098">Of love for me — my slender-waisted one !</l>
     <l n="2099">Yet no , no , no ! she would not — she that is</l>
     <l n="2100">My children 's mother ! Be it false or true ,</l>
     <l n="2101">Best shall I know in going ; therefore now</l>
     <l n="2102">The will of Rituparna must I serve . ”</l>
     <l n="2103">Thus pondering in his mind , the troubled Prince</l>
     <l n="2104">With joined palms meekly to his master said :—</l>
     <l n="2105">“ I shall thy hest accomplish ! I can drive</l>
     <l n="2106">In one day , Raja , to Vidarbha 's gates . ”</l>
     <l n="2107">Then in the royal stables — steed by steed ,</l>
     <l n="2108">Stallions and mares , Vahûka scanned them all ,</l>
     <l n="2109">By Rituparna prayed quickly to choose .</l>
     <l n="2110">Slowly he picked four coursers , under-fleshed ,</l>
     <l n="2111">But big of bone and sinew ; fetlocked well</l>
     <l n="2112">For journeying ; high-bred , heavy-framed ; of blood</l>
     <l n="2113">To match the best , yet gentle ; blemish-free ;</l>
     <l n="2114">Broad in the jaw , with scarlet nostrils spread ;</l>
     <l n="2115">Bearing the Avarthas , the ten true marks —</l>
     <l n="2116">Reared on the banks of Indus , swift as wind .</l>
     <l n="2117">Which , when the Raja looked upon , he cried ,</l>
     <l n="2118">Half-wrathful : “ What thing thinkest thou to do ?</l>
     <l n="2119">Wilt thou betray me ? How should sorry beasts ,</l>
     <l n="2120">Lean-ribbed and ragged , take us all that way ,</l>
     <l n="2121">The long road we must swiftly travel hence ? ”</l>
     <l n="2122">Vahûka answered : “ See on all these four</l>
     <l n="2123">The ten sure marks : one curl upon each crest ,</l>
     <l n="2124">Two on the cheeks , two upon either flank ,</l>
     <l n="2125">Two on the breast , and on each crupper one .<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2126">These to Vidarbha — doubt it not — will go ;</l>
     <l n="2127">Yet , Raja , if thou wilt have others , speak ;</l>
     <l n="2128">And I shall yoke them . ”</l>
     <l n="2129">Rituparna said :—</l>
     <l n="2130">“ I know thou hast deep skill in stable-craft ;</l>
     <l n="2131">Yoke therefore such four coursers as thou wilt ,</l>
     <l n="2132">But quickly ! ”</l>
     <l n="2133">Thus those horses , two by two ,</l>
     <l n="2134">High-mettled , spare , and strong , Prince Nala put</l>
     <l n="2135">Under the bars ; and when the car was hitched ,</l>
     <l n="2136">And eagerly the Raja made to mount ,</l>
     <l n="2137">At sign the coursers bent their knees , and lay</l>
     <l n="2138">Along the earth . Then Nala ( O my King ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="2139">With kindly voice cheering the gaunt bright steeds ,</l>
     <l n="2140">Loosed them , and grasped the reins , and bade ascend</l>
     <l n="2141">Varshneya : so he started , headlong , forth .</l>
     <l n="2142">At cry of Vahûka the four steeds sprung</l>
     <l n="2143">Into the air , as they would fly with him ;</l>
     <l n="2144">And when the Raja felt them , fleet as wind ,</l>
     <l n="2145">Whirling along , mute sat he and amazed ;</l>
     <l n="2146">And much Varshneya mused to hear and see</l>
     <l n="2147">The thundering of those wheels ; the fiery four</l>
     <l n="2148">So lightly held ; Vahûka 's matchless art .</l>
     <l n="2149">“ Is Mâtali , who driveth Indra 's car ,</l>
     <l n="2150">Our charioteer ? for all the marks of him</l>
     <l n="2151">Are here ! or Sâlihotra can this be ,</l>
     <l n="2152">The god of horses , knowing all their ways ,</l>
     <l n="2153">Who here in mortal form his greatness hides ?</l>
     <l n="2154">Or is it — can it be — Nala the Prince ,</l>
     <l n="2155">Nala the steed-tamer ? ” Thus pondered he :—</l>
     <l n="2156">“ Whatever Nala knew this one doth know .</l>
     <l n="2157">Alike the mastery seems of both ; alike</l>
     <l n="2158">I judge their years . If this man be not he ,</l>
     <l n="2159">Two Nalas are there in the world for skill .</l>
     <l n="2160">They say there wander mighty powers on earth</l>
     <l n="2161">In strange disguises , who , divinely sprung ,</l>
     <l n="2162">Veil themselves from us under human mould ;</l>
     <l n="2163">Bewilderment it brings me , this his shape</l>
     <l n="2164">Misshappen — from conclusion that alone</l>
     <l n="2165">Withholds me ; yet I wist not what to think ,</l>
     <l n="2166">In age and manner like — and so unlike</l>
     <l n="2167">In form ! Else Vahûka I must have deemed</l>
     <l n="2168">Nala , with Nala 's gifts . ”</l>
     <l n="2169">So in his heart ,</l>
     <l n="2170">Varshneya , watching , wondered — being himself</l>
     <l n="2171">The second charioteer . But Rituparna</l>
     <l n="2172">Sat joyous with the speed , delightedly</l>
     <l n="2173">Marking the driving of the Prince : the eyes</l>
     <l n="2174">Attent ; the hand so firm upon the reins ;</l>
     <l n="2175">The skill so quiet , wise , and masterful ;</l>
     <l n="2176">Great joy the Maharaja had to see .</l>
     <l n="2177">By stream and mountain , woodland-path and pool ,</l>
     <l n="2178">Swiftly , like birds that skim in air , they sped ;</l>
     <l n="2179">Till , as the chariot plunged , the Raja saw</l>
     <l n="2180">His shoulder-mantle falling to the ground ;</l>
     <l n="2181">And — loath to lose the robe — albeit so pressed ,</l>
     <l n="2182">To Nala cried he , “ Let me take it up ;</l>
     <l n="2183">Check the swift horses , wondrous charioteer ;</l>
     <l n="2184">And bid Varshneya light , and fetch my cloth , ”</l>
     <l n="2185">But Nala answered : “ Far it lies behind ;</l>
     <l n="2186">A yojana already we have passed ;</l>
     <l n="2187">We cannot turn again to pick it up . ”</l>
     <l n="2188">A little onward Riturparna saw</l>
     <l n="2189">Within the wood a tall Myrobolan</l>
     <l n="2190">Heavy with fruit ; hereat , eager he cried :—</l>
     <l n="2191">“ Now , Vahûka , my skill thou mayest behold</l>
     <l n="2192">In the Arithmic . All arts no man knows ;</l>
     <l n="2193">Each hath his wisdom , but in one man 's wit</l>
     <l n="2194">Is perfect gift of one thing , and not more .</l>
     <l n="2195">From yonder tree how many leaves and fruits ,</l>
     <l n="2196">Think'st thou , lie fall'n there upon the earth ?</l>
     <l n="2197">Just one above a thousand of the leaves ,</l>
     <l n="2198">And one above a hundred of the fruits ;</l>
     <l n="2199">And on those two limbs hang , of dancing leaves ,</l>
     <l n="2200">Five crores exact ; and shouldst thou pluck yon boughs</l>
     <l n="2201">Together with their shoots , on those twain boughs</l>
     <l n="2202">Swing twice a thousand nuts and ninety-five ! ”</l>
     <l n="2203">Vahûka checked the chariot wonderingly ,</l>
     <l n="2204">And answered : “ Imperceptible to me</l>
     <l n="2205">Is what thou boastest , slayer of thy foes !</l>
     <l n="2206">But I to proof will put it , hewing down</l>
     <l n="2207">The tree , and , having counted , I shall know .</l>
     <l n="2208">Before thine eyes the branches twain I 'll lop :</l>
     <l n="2209">How prove thee , Maharaja , otherwise ,</l>
     <l n="2210">Whether this be or be not ? I will count</l>
     <l n="2211">One by one — fruits and leaves — before thee , King ;</l>
     <l n="2212">Varshneya , for a space , can rein the steeds . ”</l>
     <l n="2213">To him replied the Raja : “ Time is none</l>
     <l n="2214">Now to delay . ”</l>
     <l n="2215">Vahûka answered quick</l>
     <l n="2216">( His own set purpose serving ): “ Stay this space ,</l>
     <l n="2217">Or by thyself drive on ! The road is good ,</l>
     <l n="2218">The son of Vrishni will be charioteer ! ”</l>
     <l n="2219">On that the Raja answered soothingly :—</l>
     <l n="2220">“ There is not in the earth another man</l>
     <l n="2221">That hath thy skill ; and by thy skill I look</l>
     <l n="2222">To reach Vidarbha , O thou steed-tamer !</l>
     <l n="2223">Thou art my trust ; make thou not hindrance now !</l>
     <l n="2224">Yet would I suffer , too , what thou dost ask ,</l>
     <l n="2225">If thou couldst surely reach Vidarbha 's gate</l>
     <l n="2226">Before yon sun hath sunk . ”</l>
     <l n="2227">Nala replied :—</l>
     <l n="2228">“ When I have counted those vibhîtak boughs ,</l>
     <l n="2229">Vidarbha I will reach ; now keep thy word . ”</l>
     <l n="2230">Ill pleased , the Raja said : “ Halt then , and count !</l>
     <l n="2231">Take one bough from the branch which I shall show ,</l>
     <l n="2232">And tell its fruits , and satisfy thy soul . ”</l>
     <l n="2233">So leaping from the car — eager he shore</l>
     <l n="2234">The boughs , and counted ; and all wonder-struck</l>
     <l n="2235">To Rituparna spake : “ Lo , as thou saidst</l>
     <l n="2236">So many fruits there be upon this bough !</l>
     <l n="2237">Exceeding marvellous is this thy gift ,</l>
     <l n="2238">I burn to know such learning , how it comes . ”</l>
     <l n="2239">Answered the Raja , for his journey fain :—</l>
     <l n="2240">“ My mind is quick with numbers , skilled to count ;</l>
     <l n="2241">I have the science . ”</l>
     <l n="2242">“ Give it me , dear Lord ! ”</l>
     <l n="2243">Vahûka cried : “ teach me , I pray , this lore ,</l>
     <l n="2244">And take from me my skill in horse-taming . ”</l>
     <l n="2245">Quoth Rituparna — impatient to proceed —</l>
     <l n="2246">Yet of such skill desirous : “ Be it so !</l>
     <l n="2247">As thou hast prayed , receive my secret art ,</l>
     <l n="2248">Exchanging with me here thy mastery</l>
     <l n="2249">Of horses . ”</l>
     <l n="2250">Thereupon did he impart</l>
     <l n="2251">His rules of numbers , taking Nala 's too .</l>
     <l n="2252">But wonderful ! So soon as Nala knew</l>
     <l n="2253">That hidden gift , the accursed Kali leapt</l>
     <l n="2254">Forth from his breast , the evil spirit 's mouth</l>
     <l n="2255">Spewing the poison of Karkôtaka</l>
     <l n="2256">Even as he issued . From the afflicted Prince</l>
     <l n="2257">That bitter plague of Kali passed away ;</l>
     <l n="2258">And for a space Prince Nala lost himself ,</l>
     <l n="2259">Rent by the agony . But when he saw</l>
     <l n="2260">The evil one take visible shape again —</l>
     <l n="2261">Free from the serpent 's poison — Nishadha 's Lord</l>
     <l n="2262">Had thought to curse him then ; but Kali stood</l>
     <l n="2263">With clasped palms trembling , and besought the Prince ,</l>
     <l n="2264">Saying : “ Thy wrath restrain , Sovereign of men !</l>
     <l n="2265">I will repay thee well . Thy virtuous wife ,</l>
     <l n="2266">Indrasen 's angered mother , laid her ban</l>
     <l n="2267">Upon me when thou didst forsake her ; since</l>
     <l n="2268">Within thee have I dwelled in anguish sore ,</l>
     <l n="2269">Tortured and tossed and burning , night and day ,</l>
     <l n="2270">With venom from the great snake 's fang , which passed</l>
     <l n="2271">Into me by thy blood . Be pitiful !</l>
     <l n="2272">I take my refuge in thy mercy ! Hear</l>
     <l n="2273">My promise , Prince ! Wherever men henceforth</l>
     <l n="2274">Shall name thee before people , praising thee ,</l>
     <l n="2275">This shall protect them from the dread of me ;</l>
     <l n="2276">Nala shall guard from Kali , if so now</l>
     <l n="2277">Thou spare to curse me , seeking grace of thee . ”</l>
     <l n="2278">Thus supplicated , Nala stayed his wrath ,</l>
     <l n="2279">Acceding ; and the direful Kali fled</l>
     <l n="2280">Into the wounded tree , possessing it .</l>
     <l n="2281">But of no eyes , save Nala 's , was he seen ,</l>
     <l n="2282">Nor heard of any other ; and the Prince ,</l>
     <l n="2283">His sorrows shaking off , when Kali passed ,</l>
     <l n="2284">After that numbering of the leaves , in joy</l>
     <l n="2285">Unspeakable , and glowing with new hope ,</l>
     <l n="2286">Mounted the car again , and urged his steeds .</l>
     <l n="2287">But from that hour the tall Myrobolan ,</l>
     <l n="2288">Possessed by Kali , stood there , sear and dead .</l>
     <l n="2289">Then onward , onward , speeding like the birds ,</l>
     <l n="2290">Those coursers flew ; and fast and faster still</l>
     <l n="2291">The glad Prince cheered them forward , all elate :</l>
     <l n="2292">And proudly rode the Raja towards the walls</l>
     <l n="2293">Of high Vidarbha . Thus did journey down</l>
     <l n="2294">Exultant Nala , free of trouble now ,</l>
     <l n="2295">Quit of the evil spell , but bearing still</l>
     <l n="2296">His form misshapen , and the shrunken limb .</l>
     <l n="2297">At sunset in Vidarbha ( O great King ! )</l>
     <l n="2298">The watchers on the walls proclaimed , “ There comes</l>
     <l n="2299">The Raja Rituparna ! ” Bhima bade</l>
     <l n="2300">Open the gates ; and thus they entered in ,</l>
     <l n="2301">Making all quarters of the city shake</l>
     <l n="2302">With rattling of the chariot-wheels . But when</l>
     <l n="2303">The horses of Prince Nala heard that sound ,</l>
     <l n="2304">For joy they neighed , as when of old their lord</l>
     <l n="2305">Drew nigh . And Damayanti , in her bower ,</l>
     <l n="2306">Far off that rattling of the chariot heard ,</l>
     <l n="2307">As when at time of rains is heard the voice</l>
     <l n="2308">Of clouds low thundering ; and her bosom thrilled</l>
     <l n="2309">At echo of that ringing sound . It came</l>
     <l n="2310">Loud and more loud , like Nala 's , when of old ,</l>
     <l n="2311">Gripping the reins , he cheered his mares along .</l>
     <l n="2312">It seemed like Nala to the Princess then —</l>
     <l n="2313">That clatter of the trampling of the hoofs ;</l>
     <l n="2314">It seemed like Nala to the stabled steeds :</l>
     <l n="2315">Upon the palace-roof the peacocks heard</l>
     <l n="2316">And screamed ; the elephants within their stalls</l>
     <l n="2317">Heard it and trumpeted ; the coursers , tied ,</l>
     <l n="2318">Snorted for joy to hear that leaping car ;</l>
     <l n="2319">Peacocks and elephants and cattle stalled</l>
     <l n="2320">All called and clamored with uplifted heads ,</l>
     <l n="2321">As wild things do at noise of coming rain .</l>
     <l n="2322">Then to herself the Princess spake : “ This car ,</l>
     <l n="2323">The rolling of it , echoing all around ,</l>
     <l n="2324">Gladdens my heart . It must be Nala comes ,</l>
     <l n="2325">My King of men ! If I see not , this day ,</l>
     <l n="2326">My Prince that hath the bright and moon-like face ,</l>
     <l n="2327">My hero of unnumbered gifts , my lord ,</l>
     <l n="2328">Ah , I shall die ! If this day fall I not</l>
     <l n="2329">Into his opening arms — at last , at last —</l>
     <l n="2330">And feel his close embrace , oh , beyond doubt ,</l>
     <l n="2331">I cannot live ! If — ending all — to-day</l>
     <l n="2332">Nishadha cometh not , with this deep sound</l>
     <l n="2333">Like far-off thunder , then to-night I 'll leap</l>
     <l n="2334">Into the golden , flickering , fiery flames !</l>
     <l n="2335">If now , now , now , my lion draws not nigh ,</l>
     <l n="2336">My warrior-love , like the wild elephant ,</l>
     <l n="2337">My Prince of princes — I shall surely die !</l>
     <l n="2338">Nought call I now to mind he said or did</l>
     <l n="2339">That was not rightly said and justly done .</l>
     <l n="2340">No idle word he spake , even in free speech ;</l>
     <l n="2341">Patient and lordly ; generous to bestow</l>
     <l n="2342">Beyond all givers ; scorning to be base ,</l>
     <l n="2343">Yea , even in secret — such Nishadha was .</l>
     <l n="2344">Alas ! when , day and night , I think of him ,</l>
     <l n="2345">How is my heart consumed , reft of its joy ! ”</l>
     <l n="2346">So meditating , like one torn by thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="2347">She mounted to the palace-roof to see ;</l>
     <l n="2348">And thence , in the mid-court , the car beheld</l>
     <l n="2349">Arriving . Rituparna and Vahûka</l>
     <l n="2350">She saw , with Vrishni 's son , descend and loose</l>
     <l n="2351">The panting horses , wheeling back the car .</l>
     <l n="2352">Then Rituparna , alighting , sought the King ,</l>
     <l n="2353">Bhima the Maharaja , far-renowned —</l>
     <l n="2354">Whom Bhima with fair courtesies received ;</l>
     <l n="2355">Since well he deemed such breathless visit made</l>
     <l n="2356">With deep cause , knowing not the women 's plots .</l>
     <l n="2357">“ Swâgatam ! ” cried he ; “ what hath brought thee , Prince ? ”</l>
     <l n="2358">For nothing wist he that the Raja came</l>
     <l n="2359">Suitor of Damayanti . Questioned so ,</l>
     <l n="2360">This Raja Rituparna , wise and brave ,</l>
     <l n="2361">Seeing no kings nor princes in the court ,</l>
     <l n="2362">Nor noise of the Swayamvara , nor crowd</l>
     <l n="2363">Of Bráhmans gathering — weighing all those things ,</l>
     <l n="2364">Answered in this wise : “ I am come , great Lord ,</l>
     <l n="2365">To make thee salutations ! ” But the King</l>
     <l n="2366">Laughed in his beard at Rituparna 's word —</l>
     <l n="2367">That this of many weary yojanas</l>
     <l n="2368">Should be the mark . “ Ahoswid ! Hath he passed</l>
     <l n="2369">Through twenty towns , ” thought he , “ and hither flown</l>
     <l n="2370">To bid good-morrow ? Nay , it is not that .</l>
     <l n="2371">Good ! I shall know it when he bids me know . ”</l>
     <l n="2372">Thereat , with friendly speech his noble guest</l>
     <l n="2373">The King to rest dismissed . “ Repose thyself , ”</l>
     <l n="2374">He said ; “ the road was long ; weary thou art . ”</l>
     <l n="2375">And Rituparna , with sentences of grace</l>
     <l n="2376">Replying to this graciousness , was led</l>
     <l n="2377">By slaves to the allotted sleeping-room ;</l>
     <l n="2378">And after Rituparna , Varshneya went .</l>
     <l n="2379">Vahûka , left alone , the chariot ran</l>
     <l n="2380">Into its shed , and from the foamy steeds</l>
     <l n="2381">Unbuckled all the harness , thong by thong ,</l>
     <l n="2382">Speaking soft words to them ; then sat him down ,</l>
     <l n="2383">Alone , forgotten , on the driving-seat .</l>
     <l n="2384">But Damayanti , seeing Rituparna ,</l>
     <l n="2385">And Vrishni 's son , and him called Vahûka ,</l>
     <l n="2386">Spake sorrowful : “ Whose was the thunder , then ,</l>
     <l n="2387">Of that fleet car ? It seemed like Nala 's own ;</l>
     <l n="2388">Yet here I see no Nala ! Hath yon man</l>
     <l n="2389">My lord 's art learned , or th'other one , that thus</l>
     <l n="2390">Their car should thunder as when Nala comes ?</l>
     <l n="2391">Could Rituparna drive as Nala doth ,</l>
     <l n="2392">So that those chariot-wheels should sound like his ? ”</l>
     <l n="2393">And , after having pondered ( O my King ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="2394">The beauteous Princess sent her handmaiden</l>
     <l n="2395">To Vahûka , that she might question him .</l>
     <l n="2396">“ Go , Keshinî , ” the Princess said ; “ inquire</l>
     <l n="2397">Who is that man upon the driving-seat ,</l>
     <l n="2398">Misshapen , with the shrunken arm . Approach</l>
     <l n="2399">Composedly , question him winningly</l>
     <l n="2400">With greetings kind , and bid him answer thee</l>
     <l n="2401">According to the truth . I feel at heart</l>
     <l n="2402">A doubt — a hope — that this , perchance , may be</l>
     <l n="2403">My Lord and Prince ; there is some new-born joy</l>
     <l n="2404">Fluttering within my breast . Accost him , girl ;</l>
     <l n="2405">And , ere thou partest , what Parnâda said ,</l>
     <l n="2406">Say thou , and hear him answer , blameless one ,</l>
     <l n="2407">And bring it on thy lips ! ”</l>
     <l n="2408">Then went the maid</l>
     <l n="2409">Demurely , and accosted Vahûka ,</l>
     <l n="2410">While Damayanti watched them from the roof .</l>
     <l n="2411">“ Kushalam tê bravîmi — health and peace</l>
     <l n="2412">I wish thee ! ” said she . “ Wilt thou answer true</l>
     <l n="2413">What Damayanti asks ? She sends to ask</l>
     <l n="2414">Whence set ye forth , and wherefore are ye come</l>
     <l n="2415">Hither ? Vidarbha 's Princess fain would know . ”</l>
     <l n="2416">“ ‘ Twas told my Raja , ” Vahûka replied ,</l>
     <l n="2417">“ That Damayanti for the second turn</l>
     <l n="2418">Holds her Swayamvara : the Bráhman 's word</l>
     <l n="2419">Was , “ This shall be to-morrow . ” So he sped ,</l>
     <l n="2420">Hearing that news , with steeds which in one day</l>
     <l n="2421">Fly fifty yojanas , swift as the winds ,</l>
     <l n="2422">Exceeding fleet . His charioteer am I . ”</l>
     <l n="2423">“ Who , then , ” Keshinî asked , “ is he that rode</l>
     <l n="2424">The third ? whence cometh he , and what his race ?</l>
     <l n="2425">And thou thyself whence sprung ? and tell me why</l>
     <l n="2426">Thou servest thus ? ”</l>
     <l n="2427">Then Vahûka replied :—</l>
     <l n="2428">“ Varshneya is the third who rode with us ,</l>
     <l n="2429">The famous charioteer of Nala he :</l>
     <l n="2430">When thy Prince fled , he went to Koshala</l>
     <l n="2431">And took our service . I in horse-taming</l>
     <l n="2432">And dressing meat have skill ; so am I made</l>
     <l n="2433">King Rituparna 's driver and his cook . ”</l>
     <l n="2434">“ Knoweth Varshneya , then , where Nala fled ? ”</l>
     <l n="2435">Inquired the maid ; “ and did he tell thee this ,</l>
     <l n="2436">Or what spake he ? ”</l>
     <l n="2437">“ Of that unhappy Prince</l>
     <l n="2438">He brought the children hither , and then went</l>
     <l n="2439">Even where he would , of Nala wotting nought ;</l>
     <l n="2440">Nor wotteth any man , fair damsel ! more .</l>
     <l n="2441">Hidden from mortal eyes Nishadha lives ,</l>
     <l n="2442">Wandering the world , his very body changed .</l>
     <l n="2443">Of Nala only Nala 's own heart knows ,</l>
     <l n="2444">And by no sign doth he bewray himself . ”</l>
     <l n="2445">Keshinî said : “ That Bráhman who did wend</l>
     <l n="2446">First to Ayodhyâ bore a verse to say</l>
     <l n="2447">Over and over , everywhere — strange words ,</l>

     <l n="2465">But , mastering his anguish , holding down</l>
     <l n="2466">The passion of his pain , with voice which strove</l>
     <l n="2467">To speak through sobs , the Prince repeated this :—</l>

     <l n="2523">At will , or ceases flowing ; and this , too ,</l>
     <l n="2524">The strangest thing of all , did I behold —</l>
     <l n="2525">He took some faded leaves and flowers up ,</l>
     <l n="2526">And idly handled them ; but while his hands</l>
     <l n="2527">Toyed with them , lo ! they blossomed forth again</l>
     <l n="2528">With lovelier life than ever , and fresh scent ,</l>
     <l n="2529">Straight on their stalks . These marvels have I seen ,</l>
     <l n="2530">And fly back now to tell thee , mistress dear ! ”</l>
     <l n="2531">But when she knew such wonders of the man ,</l>
     <l n="2532">More certainly she deemed those acts and gifts</l>
     <l n="2533">Betokened Nala ; and so-minded , full</l>
     <l n="2534">Of trust to find her lord in Vahûka ,</l>
     <l n="2535">With happier tears and softening voice she said</l>
     <l n="2536">To Keshinî : “ Speed yet again , my girl ;</l>
     <l n="2537">And , while he wots not , from the kitchen take</l>
     <l n="2538">Meat he hath dressed , and bring it here to me . ”</l>
     <l n="2539">So went the maid , and , waiting secretly ,</l>
     <l n="2540">Broke from the mess a morsel , hot and spiced ,</l>
     <l n="2541">And , bearing it with faithful swiftness , gave</l>
     <l n="2542">To Damayanti . She ( O Kuru King ! ) —</l>
     <l n="2543">That knew so well the dishes dressed by him —</l>
     <l n="2544">Touched , tasted it , and , laughing — weeping — cried ,</l>
     <l n="2545">Beside herself with joy : “ Yes , yes ; ‘ tis he !</l>
     <l n="2546">That charioteer is Nala ! ” then , a-pant ,</l>
     <l n="2547">Even while she washed her mouth , she bade the maid</l>
     <l n="2548">Go with the children twain to Vahûka ;</l>
     <l n="2549">Who , when he saw his little Indrasen</l>
     <l n="2550">And Indrasena , started up , and ran ,</l>
     <l n="2551">And caught , and folded them upon his breast ;</l>
     <l n="2552">Holding them there , his darlings , each as fair</l>
     <l n="2553">As children of the gods . Then , quite undone</l>
     <l n="2554">With love and yearning , loudly sobbed the Prince .</l>
     <l n="2555">Until , perceiving Keshinî , who watched ,</l>
     <l n="2556">Shamed to be known , he set his children down ,</l>
     <l n="2557">And said : “ In sooth , good friend , this lovely pair</l>
     <l n="2558">So like mine own are , that at seeing them</l>
     <l n="2559">I am surprised into these foolish tears .</l>
     <l n="2560">Thou comest here too often ; men will think</l>
     <l n="2561">Thee light , or me ; remember , we are here ,</l>
     <l n="2562">Strangers and guests , girl ! Go thy ways in peace ! ”</l>
     <l n="2563">But seeing that great trouble of his soul ,</l>
     <l n="2564">Lightly came Keshinî , and pictured all</l>
     <l n="2565">To Damayanti . She , burning to know</l>
     <l n="2566">If truly this were Nala , bade the girl</l>
     <l n="2567">Seek the Queen 's presence , saying thus for her :—</l>
     <l n="2568">“ Mother ! long watching Vahûka , I deem</l>
     <l n="2569">The charioteer is Nala . One doubt lives —</l>
     <l n="2570">His altered form . I must myself have speech</l>
     <l n="2571">With Vahûka ; thou , therefore , bid him come ,</l>
     <l n="2572">Or suffer me to seek him . Be this done</l>
     <l n="2573">Forthwith , good mother !— whether known or not</l>
     <l n="2574">Unto the Maharaja . ”</l>
     <l n="2575">When she heard ,</l>
     <l n="2576">The Queen told Bhima what the Princess prayed ,</l>
     <l n="2577">Who gave consent ; and having this good leave</l>
     <l n="2578">From father and from mother ( O my King ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="2579">Command was sent that Vahûka be brought</l>
     <l n="2580">Where the court ladies lodged .</l>
     <l n="2581">So met those twain ;</l>
     <l n="2582">And when Prince Nala 's gaze fell on his wife ,</l>
     <l n="2583">He stood with beating heart and tearful eyes .</l>
     <l n="2584">And when sweet Damayanti looked on him ,</l>
     <l n="2585">She could not speak for anguish of keen joy</l>
     <l n="2586">To have him close ; but sat there , mute and wan ,</l>
     <l n="2587">Wearing a sad-hued cloth , her lustrous hair</l>
     <l n="2588">Falling unbanded , and the mourning-mark</l>
     <l n="2589">Stamped in gray ashes on her lovely brow .</l>
     <l n="2590">And , when she found a voice , these were the words</l>
     <l n="2591">That came from her : “ Didst ever , Vahûka —</l>
     <l n="2592">If Vahûka thy name be , as thou say'st —</l>
     <l n="2593">Know one of noble nature , honorable ,</l>
     <l n="2594">Who in the wild woods left his wife asleep —</l>
     <l n="2595">His innocent , fond wife — weary and worn ?</l>
     <l n="2596">Know'st thou the man . I 'll say his name to thee ;</l>
     <l n="2597">‘ Twas Nala , Raja Nala ! Ah , and when</l>
     <l n="2598">In any thoughtless hour had I once wrought</l>
     <l n="2599">The smallest wrong , that he should leave me so ,</l>
     <l n="2600">There in the wood , by slumber overcome ?</l>
     <l n="2601">Before the gods I chose him for my lord ,</l>
     <l n="2602">The gods themselves rejecting ; tell me how</l>
     <l n="2603">This Prince could so abandon , in her need ,</l>
     <l n="2604">His true , his loving wife , she who did bear</l>
     <l n="2605">His babes — abandon her to whom he swore —</l>
     <l n="2606">My hand clasped , in the sight of all the gods ,</l>
     <l n="2607">And Agni 's self — ‘ Thy true lord I will be ! ’</l>
     <l n="2608">Thou saidst it !— where is now that promise , fled ? ”</l>
     <l n="2609">While thus she spake ( O Victor of thy foes ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="2610">Fast from her eyes the woe-sprung waters ran .</l>
     <l n="2611">And Nala , seeing those night-black , loving eyes</l>
     <l n="2612">Reddened with weeping , seeing her falling tears ;</l>
     <l n="2613">Broke forth : “ Ah ! that I lost my throne and realm</l>
     <l n="2614">In dicing , was not done by fault of mine ;</l>
     <l n="2615">‘ T was Kali wrought it ; Kali , O my wife ,</l>
     <l n="2616">Drove me to leave thee . Therefore , long ago</l>
     <l n="2617">That evil one was stricken by the curse</l>
     <l n="2618">Which thou didst utter , wandering in the wood ,</l>
     <l n="2619">Desolate , night and day , grieving for me .</l>
     <l n="2620">Possessing me he dwelt ; but , cursed by thee ,</l>
     <l n="2621">Tortured he dwelt , consuming with thy words</l>
     <l n="2622">In fierce and fiercer pain , as when is piled</l>
     <l n="2623">Brand upon burning brand . But he is gone ;</l>
     <l n="2624">Patience and penance have o'ermastered him .</l>
     <l n="2625">Princess , the end is reached of our long woes .</l>
     <l n="2626">That evil one being fled , freeing my will ,</l>
     <l n="2627">See , I am here ; and wherefore would I come ,</l>
     <l n="2628">Fairest , except for thee ? Yet , answer this :—</l>
     <l n="2629">How should a wife , right-minded to her lord —</l>
     <l n="2630">Her own and lawful lord — compass to choose</l>
     <l n="2631">Another love , as thou , that tremblest , didst ?</l>
     <l n="2632">Thy messengers over all regions ran ,</l>
     <l n="2633">By the King 's name proclaiming : ‘ Bhima 's child</l>
     <l n="2634">A second husband chooseth for herself ,</l>
     <l n="2635">Whomso she will — as pleaseth — being free , ’</l>
     <l n="2636">Those shameless tidings brought the Raja here</l>
     <l n="2637">At headlong speed — and me ! ”</l>
     <l n="2638">Tenderly smiled</l>
     <l n="2639">Damayanti through her tears , with quivering lips ,</l>
     <l n="2640">And joined palms , answering her aggrievèd Prince :—</l>
     <l n="2641">“ Judgest thou me guilty of such a sin ?</l>
     <l n="2642">When for thy sake I put the gods aside —</l>
     <l n="2643">Thee did I choose , Nishadha , my one lord .</l>
     <l n="2644">In quest of thee did all those Bráhmans range</l>
     <l n="2645">In all ten regions , telling all one tale</l>
     <l n="2646">Taught them by me ; and so Parnâda came</l>
     <l n="2647">To Koshala , where Rituparna dwells ,</l>
     <l n="2648">And found thee in his house , and spake to thee</l>
     <l n="2649">Those words , and had thy gentle answer back .</l>
     <l n="2650">Mine the device was , Prince , to bring thee quick ;</l>
     <l n="2651">For well I wist no man in all this world</l>
     <l n="2652">Could in one day the fleetest coursers urge</l>
     <l n="2653">So many yojanas , save thou , dear Prince !</l>
     <l n="2654">I touch thy feet , and tell thee this in truth ;</l>
     <l n="2655">And true it is that never any wrong</l>
     <l n="2656">Against thee , even in fancy , have I dreamed .</l>
     <l n="2657">Witness for me , as I am loyal and pure ,</l>
     <l n="2658">The ever-shifting , all-beholding Air ,</l>
     <l n="2659">Who wanders o'er the earth ; let him withdraw</l>
     <l n="2660">My breath and slay me , if I sinned in aught !</l>
     <l n="2661">Witness for me , yon golden Sun who goes</l>
     <l n="2662">With bright eye over us ; let him withhold</l>
     <l n="2663">Warm life and kill me , if I sinned in aught !</l>
     <l n="2664">Witness for me the white Moon , whose pale spell</l>
     <l n="2665">Lies on all flesh and spirit ; let that orb</l>
     <l n="2666">Deny me peace and end me , if I sinned !</l>
     <l n="2667">These be the watchers and the testifiers ,</l>
     <l n="2668">The three chief gods that rule the three wide worlds ;</l>
     <l n="2669">I cry unto them ; let them speak for me ;</l>
     <l n="2670">And thou shalt hear them answer for my faith ,</l>
     <l n="2671">Or once again , this day , abandon me . ”</l>
     <l n="2672">Then Vayu showed — the all-enfolding Air —</l>
     <l n="2673">And spake : “ Not one wrong hath she wrought thee , Prince ,</l>
     <l n="2674">I tell thee sooth . The treasure of her truth</l>
     <l n="2675">Faultless and undefiled she hath kept</l>
     <l n="2676">By us regarded , and sustained by us ,</l>
     <l n="2677">These many days . Her tender plot it was ,</l>
     <l n="2678">Planned for thy sake , which brought thee ; since who else</l>
     <l n="2679">Could in one day drive threescore yojanas ?</l>
     <l n="2680">Nala , thou hast thy noble wife again ;</l>
     <l n="2681">Thou , Damayanti , hast thy Nala back .</l>
     <l n="2682">Away with doubting ; take her to thy breast ,</l>
     <l n="2683">Thrice happy Prince ! ”</l>
     <l n="2684">And while God Vayu spake ,</l>
     <l n="2685">Look ! there showered flowers down out of the sky<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2686">Upon them ; and the drums of heaven beat</l>
     <l n="2687">Beautiful music , and a gentle wind ,</l>
     <l n="2688">Fragrant , propitious , floated , kissing them .</l>
     <l n="2689">But Nala , when he saw these things befall —</l>
     <l n="2690">Wonderful , gracious — when he heard that voice</l>
     <l n="2691">Called the great snake to memory :— whereupon</l>
     <l n="2692">His proper self returned . Bhima 's fair child</l>
     <l n="2693">Divinely sounding ( Lord of Bhârat 's line ! ) —</l>
     <l n="2694">Yielded all doubt of his delightful Love .</l>
     <l n="2695">Then cast he round about his neck the cloth —</l>
     <l n="2696">Unstained by earth , enchanted — and ( O King ! )</l>
     <l n="2697">Saw her dear lord his beauteous form resume .</l>
     <l n="2698">“ Ah , Nala ! Nala ! ” cried she , while her arms</l>
     <l n="2699">Clasped him and clung ; and Nala to his heart</l>
     <l n="2700">Pressed that bright lady , glowing , as of old ,</l>
     <l n="2701">With princely majesty . Their children twain</l>
     <l n="2702">Next he caressed ; while she — at happy peace —</l>
     <l n="2703">Her beautiful glad face laid on his breast ,</l>
     <l n="2704">Sighing with too much joy . And Nala stood</l>
     <l n="2705">A great space silent , gazing on her face ,</l>
     <l n="2706">Sorrow-stamped yet , her long , deep-lidded eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2707">Her melting smile — himself ‘ twixt joy and woe .</l>
     <l n="2708">Afterwards , all that story of the Prince ,</l>
     <l n="2709">And all of Damayanti , Bhima 's Queen</l>
     <l n="2710">Told to the Maharaja joyously .</l>
     <l n="2711">And Bhima said : “ To-morrow will I see —</l>
     <l n="2712">When Nala hath his needful offerings made —</l>
     <l n="2713">Our daughter and this wandering lord well knit . ”</l>
     <l n="2714">But all that night they sat , hand clasped in hand ,</l>
     <l n="2715">Rejoicing , and relating what befell</l>
     <l n="2716">In the wild wood , and of the woful times .</l>
     <l n="2717">That night being spent , Prince Nala in his state</l>
     <l n="2718">Led forth Vidarbha 's Pride before the court .</l>
     <l n="2719">And Bhima — in an hour found fortunate —</l>
     <l n="2720">Re-wed those married lovers . Dutifully</l>
     <l n="2721">Nala paid homage to the Maharaja ,</l>
     <l n="2722">And reverently did Damayanti bow</l>
     <l n="2723">Before her father . He the Prince received</l>
     <l n="2724">With grace and gladness , as a son restored ,</l>
     <l n="2725">Making fair welcome , and with words of praise</l>
     <l n="2726">Exalting Damayanti , tried and true ;</l>
     <l n="2727">Which in all dignity Prince Nala took ,</l>
     <l n="2728">Returning , as was meet , words honorable .</l>
     <l n="2729">Therewith unto the city spread the noise</l>
     <l n="2730">Of that rejoicing . All the townspeople ,</l>
     <l n="2731">Learning of Nala joyously returned ,</l>
     <l n="2732">Made all their quarters gay with float of flags ,</l>
     <l n="2733">Flutter of cloths , and garlands ; sprinkled free</l>
     <l n="2734">The King'shYpppHeNways with fresh water , and the cups</l>
     <l n="2735">Of fragrant flowers ; and hung long wreaths of flowers .</l>
     <l n="2736">From door to door the white street-fronts before ;</l>
     <l n="2737">And decked each temple-porch , and went about</l>
     <l n="2738">The altar-gods .</l>
     <l n="2739">And afterwards , in Bhima 's royal house</l>
     <l n="2740">Serenely dwelled the Princess and the Prince ,</l>
     <l n="2741">Each making for the other peaceful joy .</l>
     <l n="2742">So in the fourth year Nala was rejoined</l>
     <l n="2743">To Damayanti , comforted and free ,</l>
     <l n="2744">Restful , attained , tasting delights again .</l>
     <l n="2745">Also the glad Princess , gaining her lord ,</l>
     <l n="2746">Laid sorrows by , and blossomed forth anew ,</l>
     <l n="2747">As doth the laughing earth when the rain falls ,</l>
     <l n="2748">And brings her unseen , waiting wonders forth</l>
     <l n="2749">Of blade and flower and fruit . The ache was gone ,</l>
     <l n="2750">The loneliness and load . Heart-full of ease ,</l>
     <l n="2751">Lovelier she grew and brighter , like the moon</l>
     <l n="2752">Mounting at midnight in the cloudless blue .</l>
     <l n="2753">When Rituparna heard</l>
     <l n="2754">How Vahûka is Nala in disguise ,</l>
     <l n="2755">And of the meeting , right rejoiced at heart</l>
     <l n="2756">That Raja grew . And , being softly prayed</l>
     <l n="2757">By Nala favorable thought , the King</l>
     <l n="2758">Made royal and gentle answer , with like grace</l>
     <l n="2759">By Nala met . To whom spake Rituparna :—</l>
     <l n="2760">“ Joy go with thee and her , happily joined .</l>
     <l n="2761">But say , Nishadha , wrought I any jot</l>
     <l n="2762">Wrongful to thee , whilst sojourning unknown</l>
     <l n="2763">Within my walls ? If any word or deed ,</l>
     <l n="2764">Purposed or purposeless , hath vexed thee , friend ,</l>
     <l n="2765">For one and all thy pardon grant to me ! ”</l>
     <l n="2766">And Nala answered : “ Never act or word ,</l>
     <l n="2767">The smallest , Raja , lingers to excuse !</l>
     <l n="2768">If this were otherwise , thy slave was I ,</l>
     <l n="2769">And might not question , but must pardon thee .</l>
     <l n="2770">Yet good to me thou wert , princely and just ,</l>
     <l n="2771">And kind thou art ; and friendly from this time</l>
     <l n="2772">Deign thou to be . Happily was I lodged ,</l>
     <l n="2773">Well-tended , well-befriended in thy house ;</l>
     <l n="2774">In mine own palace never better stead .</l>
     <l n="2775">The skill in steeds which pleased thee , that is mine ,</l>
     <l n="2776">And , Raja , I will give it all to thee ,</l>
     <l n="2777">If thou art minded . ”</l>
     <l n="2778">So Nishadha gave</l>
     <l n="2779">All his great gift in horses to the King ,</l>
     <l n="2780">Who learned each rule approved , and ordinance ;</l>
     <l n="2781">And , having all this knowledge , gave in turn</l>
     <l n="2782">His deepest lore of numbers and the dice</l>
     <l n="2783">To Nala , afterwards departing home</l>
     <l n="2784">To his own place , another charioteer</l>
     <l n="2785">Driving his steeds ; and , Rituparna gone ,</l>
     <l n="2786">Not long did Nala dwell in Bhima 's town .</l>
     <l n="2787">When one moon he had tarried , taking leave ,</l>
     <l n="2788">Nishadha to his city started forth</l>
     <l n="2789">With chosen train . A shining car he drove ;</l>
     <l n="2790">And elephants sixteen , and fifty horse ,</l>
     <l n="2791">And footmen thirty-score came in the rear .</l>
     <l n="2792">Swiftly did Nala journey , making earth</l>
     <l n="2793">Quake ‘ neath his flying car ; and wrathfully</l>
     <l n="2794">With quick steps entered he his palace doors .</l>
     <l n="2795">The son of Virasena , Nala , stood</l>
     <l n="2796">Once more before that gamester Pushkara !</l>
     <l n="2797">Spake he : “ Play yet again ; much wealth is mine ,</l>
     <l n="2798">And that , and all I have — yea , my Princess —</l>
     <l n="2799">Set I for stakes : set thou this realm , and throw !</l>
     <l n="2800">My mind is fixed a second chance to try ,</l>
     <l n="2801">Where , Pushkara , we will play for all or none .</l>
     <l n="2802">Who wins his throne and treasures from a prince ,</l>
     <l n="2803">Must stand the hazard of the counter-cast —</l>
     <l n="2804">This is the accepted law . If thou dost blench ,</l>
     <l n="2805">The next game we will play is ‘ life or death , ’</l>

     <l n="2807">One shall lie satisfied : ‘ Descended realms ,</l>
     <l n="2808">By whatsoever means , are to be sought , ’</l>
     <l n="2809">The sages say , ‘ by whatsoever won . ’</l>
     <l n="2810">Choose , therefore , Pushkara , which way of these</l>
     <l n="2811">Shall please thee ; either meet me with the dice ,</l>
     <l n="2812">Or with thy bow confront me in the field . ”</l>
     <l n="2813">When Pushkara this heard , lightly he smiled ,</l>
     <l n="2814">Concluding victory sure ; and to the Prince</l>
     <l n="2815">Answered , exulting : “ Dishtya ! hast thou gained</l>
     <l n="2816">Stakes for a counter-game , Nishadha , now ?</l>
     <l n="2817">Dishtya ! shall I have my hard-won prize ,</l>

     <l n="2819">In kissing-reach again of thy fair wife ?</l>
     <l n="2820">Soon , in thy new gold splendid , she shall shine</l>
     <l n="2821">Before all men beside me , as in heaven</l>
     <l n="2822">On Sakra waits the loveliest Apsarâ .</l>
     <l n="2823">See , now , I thought on thee , I looked for thee ,</l>
     <l n="2824">Ever and ever , Prince . There is no joy</l>
     <l n="2825">Like casting in the game with such as thee .</l>
     <l n="2826">And when to-day I win thy blameless one —</l>
     <l n="2827">The smooth-limbed Damayanti — then shall be</l>
     <l n="2828">What was to be : and I can rest content ,</l>
     <l n="2829">For always in my heart her beauty burns . ”</l>
     <l n="2830">Listening the idle talk that babbler poured ,</l>
     <l n="2831">Angry Prince Nala fain had lopped away</l>
     <l n="2832">His head with vengeful khudga ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>but , unmoved ,</l>
     <l n="2833">Albeit the wrath blazed in his bloodshot eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2834">He made reply : “ Play ! mock me not with jests ;</l>
     <l n="2835">Thou wilt not jest when I have cast with thee ! ”</l>
     <l n="2836">So was the game set , and the Princes threw</l>
     <l n="2837">Nala and Pushkara , and — the numbers named —</l>
     <l n="2838">By Nala was the hazard gained : he swept</l>
     <l n="2839">His brother 's stake , gems , treasure , kingdom , off ;</l>
     <l n="2840">At one stroke all that mighty venture won .</l>
     <l n="2841">Then quoth the conquering Prince to Pushkara ,</l>
     <l n="2842">Scornfully smiling : “ Mine is now once more</l>
     <l n="2843">Nishadha 's throne ; mine is the realm again ,</l>
     <l n="2844">Its curse plucked forth ; Vidarbha 's glory thou ,</l>
     <l n="2845">Outcast , shalt ne'er so much as look upon !</l>
     <l n="2846">Fool ! who to-day becom'st her bond and slave .</l>
     <l n="2847">Not by thy gifts that evil stroke was wrought</l>
     <l n="2848">Wherefrom I fled before ; ‘ twas Kali 's spell —</l>
     <l n="2849">Albeit thou knew'st nought , fool — overmastered me ;</l>
     <l n="2850">Yet will I visit not in wrathful wise</l>
     <l n="2851">My wrong on thee ; live as thou wilt ; I grant</l>
     <l n="2852">Wherewith to live , and set apart henceforth</l>
     <l n="2853">Thy proper goods and substance , and fit food .</l>
     <l n="2854">Nay , doubt not I shall show thee favor , too ,</l>
     <l n="2855">And be in friendship with thee , if thou wilt ,</l>
     <l n="2856">Who art my brother . Peace abide with thee ! ”</l>
     <l n="2857">Thus all-victorious Nala comforted</l>
     <l n="2858">His brother , and embraced him , sending him</l>
     <l n="2859">In honor to his town ; and Pushkara —</l>
     <l n="2860">Gently entreated — to Nishadha spake ,</l>
     <l n="2861">With folded palms and humbled face , these words :—</l>
     <l n="2862">“ Unending be thy glory . May thy bliss</l>
     <l n="2863">Last and increase for twice five thousand years ,</l>
     <l n="2864">Who grantest me wherewith to live , just Lord !</l>
     <l n="2865">And where to dwell . ” Thereafter , well bested ,</l>
     <l n="2866">Pushkara sojourned with the Prince one moon ;</l>
     <l n="2867">So to his town departed — heart-content —</l>
     <l n="2868">With slaves and foot-soldiers and followers ,</l>
     <l n="2869">Gay as a rising sun ( O Bhârat 's glory ! ) .</l>
     <l n="2870">Thus sent he Pushkara , rich and safe , away .</l>
     <l n="2871">Then , with flags and drums and jewels , robed and royally arrayed ,</l>
     <l n="2872">Nala into fair Nishadha entry high and dazzling made ;</l>
     <l n="2873">At the gates the Raja , halting , spake his people words of love ;</l>
     <l n="2874">Gathered were they from the city , gathered from the field and grove ;</l>
     <l n="2875">From the mountain and the maidan , all a-thrill with joy to see</l>
     <l n="2876">Nala come to guard his children . “ Happy now our days will be , ”</l>
     <l n="2877">Said the townsfolk , said the elders , said the villagers , “ O King ! ”</l>
     <l n="2878">Standing all with palms upfolded : “ Peace and fortune thou wilt bring</l>

    <head>SELECTIONS FROM THE RÁMÁYANA</head>
    <head>BY</head>
    <head>VÁLMÍKI</head>
     <l n="1">[ Metrical translation by R. T. H . Griffiths ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
   <p>The ideas of the human family are few , as is apparent from the study of the literature of widely different nations . Thus the “ Rámáyana ” ranks in Hindoo with the “ Iliad ” and the “ Odyssey ” in Greek literature . The character of Ráma corresponds with that of Menelaus , for both the European and the Asiatic heroes have had their wives carried off from them — although Sítá , the bride of Ráma , is chaste as an icicle from Diana 's temple , while Helen is the infamous type of wanton wives , ancient and modern . The Hindoo Lanka is Troy , and Ayodhyá is Sparta . The material civilization of the cities in the Hindoo epic is more luxurious and gorgeous than that which Homer attributes to Greece in the heroic age . Such splendor and refinement as invests social life at Lanka and Ayodhyá never appear amid the severe simplicity of Argos or Troy . The moral tone seems perhaps higher in India than in Greece during the periods described in their several epics — at least as far as mutual love and forbearance go — and the ideas of marriage and conjugal fidelity are equally exalted .</p>
   <p>As to the literary quality of the Hindoo epic in comparison with Homer 's work , we are at once impressed with the immense superiority of the Greek poem in artistic proportion , point , and precision . The Hindoo poet flounders along , amid a maze of prolix description and wearisome simile . Trifles are amplified and repeated , and the whole poem resembles a wild forest abounding in rich tropical vegetation , palms and flowers , but without paths , roads , or limits . Or rather , we are reminded of one of the highly painted and richly decorated idols of India , with their many heads and many hands : but when we turn to the Greek epic we stand before a statue of pure outline , flawless proportions , and more than human beauty .</p>
   <p>It is difficult to fix the date of the “ Rámáyana . ” Scholars generally agree that it belongs to the third century before Christ , in its original form , but that some recent portions were added even during the Christian era . It is reckoned as one of the sacred books , and the study of it is supposed to bring forgiveness of sin , and prosperity . Its author is thought to have been the famous poet Válmíki , but the work has evidently been rehandled several times , and there are three versions of the poems still extant . The poem consists of twenty-four thousand verses , and the story of it — now overlaid as it is with extravagant and fabulous accretions — is evidently founded on fact . The scene of the poem is laid in the city of Ayodhyá , the modern Oudh , which is described in glowing colors as a place of health , beauty , and prosperity —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In by-gone ages built and planned</l>
     <l n="2">By sainted Manu 's princely hand . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the splendid palace of the Rajah , at Oudh , lives Daśaratha , mourning in childlessness . He is one of the princes descended from the sun , and his line now threatens to become extinct . He determines to appeal to the Gods by the Asva-medha , the great sacrifice in which a horse is the victim . The rites accordingly are performed with unparalleled magnificence , and , at the close of the ceremony , the high priest declares to the king —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Four sons , O Monarch , shall be thine ,</l>
     <l n="2">Upholders of the royal line . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Among the offspring duly granted to Daśaratha is Ráma , who is a typical Hindoo of the heroic type . His fair wife , Sítá , is carried off by the demon Ravana , who had assumed the form of a humble priest , or ascetic , in order to gain access to her . He carries her in his chariot to Lanka , the fair city built on an island of the sea . By the assistance of a large army of monkeys , Ráma marches against Lanka , and when they stand helpless — for the water separates them from Ceylon — he then invokes the goddess of the sea , as Achilles did Thetis , and she comes in radiant beauty , telling them how to bridge the waves . The monkeys bring timber and stones , the bridge is built , Lanka reached , and the battle begins . Indra sends his own chariot down from heaven to Ráma , who mounts it , and vanquishes Ravana in single combat , upon which Sítá is restored to her husband . E. W .</p>

    <head>THE KING</head>
     <l n="1">There reigned a King of name revered ,</l>
     <l n="2">To country and to town endeared ,</l>
     <l n="3">Great Daśaratha , good and sage ,</l>
     <l n="4">Well read in Scripture 's holy page :</l>
     <l n="5">Upon his kingdom 's weal intent ,</l>
     <l n="6">Mighty and brave and provident ;</l>
     <l n="7">The pride of old Ikshváku 's seed</l>
     <l n="8">For lofty thought and righteous deed .</l>
     <l n="9">Peer of the saints , for virtues famed ,</l>
     <l n="10">For foes subdued and passions tamed ;</l>
     <l n="11">A rival in his wealth untold</l>
     <l n="12">Of Indra and the Lord of Gold .</l>
     <l n="13">Like Manu first of kings , he reigned ,</l>
     <l n="14">And worthily his state maintained .</l>
     <l n="15">For firm and just and ever true</l>
     <l n="16">Love , duty , gain , he kept in view ,</l>
     <l n="17">And ruled his city rich and free ,</l>
     <l n="18">Like Indra 's Amarávatí .</l>
     <l n="19">And worthy of so fair a place</l>
     <l n="20">There dwelt a just and happy race</l>
     <l n="21">With troops of children blest .</l>
     <l n="22">Each man contented sought no more ,</l>
     <l n="23">Nor longed with envy for the store</l>
     <l n="24">By richer friends possessed .</l>
     <l n="25">For poverty was there unknown ,</l>
     <l n="26">And each man counted as his own</l>
     <l n="27">Kine , steeds , and gold , and grain .</l>
     <l n="28">All dressed in raiment bright and clean ,</l>
     <l n="29">And every townsman might be seen</l>
     <l n="30">With ear-rings , wreath or chain .</l>
     <l n="31">None deigned to feed on broken fare ,</l>
     <l n="32">And none was false or stingy there .</l>
     <l n="33">A piece of gold , the smallest pay ,</l>
     <l n="34">Was earned by labor for a day .</l>
     <l n="35">On every arm were bracelets worn ,</l>
     <l n="36">And none was faithless or forsworn ,</l>
     <l n="37">A braggart or unkind .</l>
     <l n="38">None lived upon another 's wealth ,</l>
     <l n="39">None pined with dread or broken health ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or dark disease of mind .</l>
     <l n="41">High-souled were all . The slanderous word ,</l>
     <l n="42">The boastful lie , were never heard .</l>
     <l n="43">Each man was constant to his vows ,</l>
     <l n="44">And lived devoted to his spouse .</l>
     <l n="45">No other love his fancy knew ,</l>
     <l n="46">And she was tender , kind , and true .</l>
     <l n="47">Her dames were fair of form and face ,</l>
     <l n="48">With charm of wit and gentle grace ,</l>
     <l n="49">With modest raiment simply neat ,</l>
     <l n="50">And winning manners soft and sweet .</l>
     <l n="51">The twice-born sages , whose delight</l>
     <l n="52">Was Scripture 's page and holy rite ,</l>
     <l n="53">Their calm and settled course pursued ,</l>
     <l n="54">Nor sought the menial multitude .</l>
     <l n="55">In many a Scripture each was versed ,</l>
     <l n="56">And each the flame of worship nursed ,</l>
     <l n="57">And gave with lavish hand .</l>
     <l n="58">Each paid to Heaven the offerings due ,</l>
     <l n="59">And none was godless or untrue</l>
     <l n="60">In all that holy band .</l>
     <l n="61">To Bráhmans , as the laws ordain ,</l>
     <l n="62">The Warrior caste were ever fain</l>
     <l n="63">The reverence due to pay ;</l>
     <l n="64">And these the Vaiśyas ’ peaceful crowd ,</l>
     <l n="65">Who trade and toil for gain , were proud</l>
     <l n="66">To honor and obey ;</l>
     <l n="67">And all were by the Súdras served ,</l>
     <l n="68">Who never from their duty swerved .</l>
     <l n="69">Their proper worship all addressed</l>
     <l n="70">To Bráhman , spirits , God , and guest .</l>
     <l n="71">Pure and unmixt their rites remained ,</l>
     <l n="72">Their race 's honor ne'er was stained .</l>
     <l n="73">Cheered by his grandsons , sons , and wife ,</l>
     <l n="74">Each passed a long and happy life .</l>
     <l n="75">Thus was that famous city held</l>
     <l n="76">By one who all his race excelled ,</l>
     <l n="77">Blest in his gentle reign ,</l>
     <l n="78">As the whole land aforetime swayed</l>
     <l n="79">By Manu , prince of men , obeyed</l>
     <l n="80">Her king from main to main .</l>
     <l n="81">And heroes kept her , strong and brave ,</l>
     <l n="82">As lions guard their mountain cave ;</l>

     <l n="18">Each plan and nod and look they read ,</l>
     <l n="19">Upon their neighbors ’ good intent ,</l>
     <l n="20">Most active and benevolent ;</l>
     <l n="21">As sits the Vasus round their King ,</l>

     <l n="31">Bound in sweet friendship each to each ,</l>
     <l n="32">They spoke kind thoughts in gentle speech .</l>
     <l n="33">They looked alike with equal eye</l>
     <l n="34">On every caste , on low and high .</l>
     <l n="35">Devoted to their King , they sought ,</l>
     <l n="36">Ere his tongue spoke , to learn his thought ,</l>

     <l n="39">In foreign lands or in their own</l>
     <l n="40">Whatever passed , to them was known .</l>

     <l n="42">What men were doing or would do .</l>
     <l n="43">Skilled in the grounds of war and peace</l>
     <l n="44">They saw the monarch 's state increase ,</l>
     <l n="45">Watching his weal with conquering eye</l>
     <l n="46">That never let occasion by ,</l>
     <l n="47">While nature lent her aid to bless</l>
     <l n="48">Their labors with unbought success .</l>
     <l n="49">Never for anger , lust , or gain ,</l>
     <l n="50">Would they their lips with falsehood stain .</l>
     <l n="51">Inclined to mercy they could scan</l>
     <l n="52">The weakness and the strength of man .</l>
     <l n="53">They fairly judged both high and low ,</l>
     <l n="54">And ne'er would wrong a guiltless foe ;</l>
     <l n="55">Yet if a fault were proved , each one</l>

     <l n="69">With trusty agents , as beseems ,</l>
     <l n="70">Each distant realm he scanned ,</l>
     <l n="71">As the sun visits with his beams</l>
     <l n="72">Each corner of the land .</l>
     <l n="73">Ne'er would he on a mightier foe</l>

     <l n="75">Nor at an equal strike a blow</l>
     <l n="76">In war 's delusive chance .</l>
     <l n="77">These lords in council bore their part</l>
     <l n="78">With ready brain and faithful heart ,</l>
     <l n="79">With skill and knowledge , sense and tact ,</l>
     <l n="80">Good to advise and bold to act .</l>
     <l n="81">And high and endless fame he won</l>
     <l n="82">With these to guide his schemes —</l>

     <l n="84">Forth came the hermit 's son to view</l>

     <l n="94">Near and more near the hermit drew ,</l>

     <l n="96">And stronger still the impulse grew</l>
     <l n="97">To question whence they came .</l>
     <l n="98">They marked the young ascetic gaze</l>
     <l n="99">With curious eye and wild amaze ,</l>
     <l n="100">And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang ,</l>
     <l n="101">And shrill their merry laughter rang .</l>
     <l n="102">Then came they nearer to his side ,</l>
     <l n="103">And languishing with passion cried :—</l>
     <l n="104">“ Whose son , O youth , and who art thou ,</l>

     <l n="125">Beneath the shelter of his cell —</l>

     <l n="127">And woodland fruit and roots to eat .</l>
     <l n="128">They smiled and spoke sweet words like these .</l>
     <l n="129">Delighted with his courtesies :—</l>

     <l n="139">And luscious mead their stores supplied .</l>
     <l n="140">The seeming fruits , in taste and look ,</l>
     <l n="141">The unsuspecting hermit took ,</l>
     <l n="142">For , strange to him , their form beguiled</l>
     <l n="143">The dweller in the lonely wild .</l>
     <l n="144">Then round his neck fair arms were flung ,</l>
     <l n="145">And there the laughing damsels clung ,</l>
     <l n="146">And pressing nearer and more near</l>
     <l n="147">With sweet lips whispered at his ear ;</l>
     <l n="148">While rounded limb and swelling breast</l>
     <l n="149">The youthful hermit softly pressed .</l>
     <l n="150">The pleasing charm of that strange bowl ,</l>
     <l n="151">The touch of a tender limb ,</l>
     <l n="152">Over his yielding spirit stole</l>
     <l n="153">And sweetly vanquished him —</l>
     <l n="154">But vows , they said , must now be paid ;</l>
     <l n="155">They bade the boy farewell ,</l>
     <l n="156">And of the aged saint afraid ,</l>
     <l n="157">Prepared to leave the dell .</l>

     <l n="160">Then , lest the sire should find them there ,</l>
     <l n="161">Sped by wild paths away .</l>
     <l n="162">They fled and left him there alone</l>
     <l n="163">By longing love possessed ;</l>
     <l n="164">And with a heart no more his own</l>
     <l n="165">He roamed about distressed .</l>
     <l n="166">The aged saint came home , to find</l>
     <l n="167">The hermit boy distraught ,</l>
     <l n="168">Revolving in his troubled mind</l>
     <l n="169">One solitary thought .</l>
     <l n="170">“ Why dost thou not , my son , ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="171">“ Thy due obeisance pay ?</l>
     <l n="172">Why do I see thee in the tide</l>
     <l n="173">Of whelming thought to-day ?</l>
     <l n="174">A devotee should never wear</l>
     <l n="175">A mien so sad and strange .</l>
     <l n="176">Come , quickly , dearest child , declare</l>
     <l n="177">The reason of the change . ”</l>
     <l n="178">And Rishyaśring , when questioned thus ,</l>
     <l n="179">Made answer in this wise :—</l>
     <l n="180">“ O sire , there came to visit us</l>
     <l n="181">Some men with lovely eyes .</l>
     <l n="182">About my neck soft arms they wound</l>
     <l n="183">And kept me tightly held</l>
     <l n="184">To tender breasts so soft and round ,</l>
     <l n="185">That strangely heaved and swelled .</l>
     <l n="186">They sing more sweetly as they dance</l>
     <l n="187">Than e'er I heard till now ,</l>
     <l n="188">And play with many a sidelong glance</l>
     <l n="189">And arching of the brow . ”</l>
     <l n="190">“ My son , ” said he , “ thus giants roam</l>
     <l n="191">Where holy hermits are ,</l>
     <l n="192">And wander round their peaceful home</l>
     <l n="193">Their rites austere to mar .</l>
     <l n="194">I charge thee , thou must never lay</l>
     <l n="195">Thy trust in them , dear boy :—</l>
     <l n="196">They seek thee only to betray ,</l>
     <l n="197">And woo but to destroy . ”</l>
     <l n="198">Thus having warned him of his foes</l>
     <l n="199">That night at home he spent ,</l>
     <l n="200">And when the morrow 's sun arose</l>
     <l n="201">Forth to the forest went .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="202">But Rishyaśring with eager pace</l>

     <l n="204">Where he those visitants had seen</l>
     <l n="205">Of dainty waist and charming mien .</l>
     <l n="206">When from afar they saw the son</l>
     <l n="207">Of Saint Vibhándak toward them run ,</l>
     <l n="208">To meet the hermit boy they hied ,</l>
     <l n="209">And hailed him with a smile , and cried :—</l>

     <l n="212">Due honor there to thee we 'll pay ,</l>
     <l n="213">And speed thee on thy homeward way . ”</l>
     <l n="214">Pleased with the gracious words they said</l>
     <l n="215">He followed where the damsels led .</l>
     <l n="216">As with his guides his steps he bent ,</l>
     <l n="217">That Bráhman high of worth ,</l>
     <l n="218">A flood of rain from heaven sent</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="220">Vibhándak took his homeward road ,</l>

     <l n="223">Entered at last his cottage door .</l>
     <l n="224">Fain for his son he looked around ,</l>
     <l n="225">But desolate the cell he found .</l>

     <l n="231">Nor tidings of his son could gain .</l>
     <l n="232">One day beyond the forest 's bound</l>
     <l n="233">The wandering saint a village found ,</l>

     <l n="36">Of nectar as in heaven is quaffed —</l>
     <l n="37">A vase so vast , so bright to view ,</l>
     <l n="38">They scarce could count the vision true .</l>
     <l n="39">Upon the King his eyes he bent ,</l>
     <l n="40">And said : “ The Lord of life has sent</l>
     <l n="41">His servant down , O Prince , to be</l>
     <l n="42">A messenger from heaven to thee . ”</l>
     <l n="43">The King with all his nobles by</l>
     <l n="44">Raised reverent hands and made reply :—</l>
     <l n="45">“ Welcome , O glorious being ! Say</l>
     <l n="46">How can my care thy grace repay , ”</l>
     <l n="47">Envoy of Him whom all adore ,</l>
     <l n="48">Thus to the King he spake once more :—</l>
     <l n="49">“ The Gods accept thy worship — they</l>
     <l n="50">Give thee the blessed fruit to-day .</l>
     <l n="51">Approach and take , O glorious King ,</l>
     <l n="52">This heavenly nectar which I bring ,</l>
     <l n="53">For it shall give thee sons and wealth ,</l>
     <l n="54">And bless thee with a store of health .</l>
     <l n="55">Give it to those fair queens of thine ,</l>
     <l n="56">And bid them quaff the drink divine —</l>
     <l n="57">And they the princely sons shall bear</l>
     <l n="58">Long sought by sacrifice and prayer . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="59">“ Yea , O my lord , ” the monarch said ,</l>
     <l n="60">And took the vase upon his head ,</l>
     <l n="61">The gift of Gods , of fine gold wrought ,</l>
     <l n="62">With store of heavenly liquor fraught .</l>
     <l n="63">He honored , filled with transport new ,</l>
     <l n="64">That wondrous being , fair to view ,</l>
     <l n="65">As round the envoy of the God</l>
     <l n="66">With reverential steps he trod .</l>
     <l n="67">His errand done , that form of light</l>
     <l n="68">Arose and vanished from the sight .</l>
     <l n="69">High rapture filled the monarch 's soul ,</l>
     <l n="70">Possessed of that celestial bowl ,</l>
     <l n="71">As when a man by want distressed</l>
     <l n="72">With unexpected wealth is blest .</l>
     <l n="73">And rays of transport seemed to fall</l>
     <l n="74">Illuminating bower and hall ,</l>
     <l n="75">As when the autumn moon rides high ,</l>
     <l n="76">And floods with lovely light the sky .</l>
     <l n="77">Quick to the ladies ’ bower he sped ,</l>
     <l n="78">And thus to Queen Kauśalyá said :—</l>
     <l n="79">“ This genial nectar take and quaff , ”</l>
     <l n="80">He spoke , and gave the lady half .</l>
     <l n="81">Part of the nectar that remained</l>
     <l n="82">Sumitrá from his hand obtained .</l>
     <l n="83">He gave , to make her fruitful too ,</l>
     <l n="84">Kaikeyí half the residue .</l>
     <l n="85">A portion yet remaining there ,</l>
     <l n="86">He paused awhile to think ,</l>
     <l n="87">Then gave Sumitrá , with her share ,</l>
     <l n="88">The remnant of the drink .</l>
     <l n="89">Thus on each queen of those fair three</l>
     <l n="90">A part the King bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="91">And with sweet hope a child to see</l>
     <l n="92">Their yearning bosoms glowed .</l>
     <l n="93">The heavenly bowl the King supplied</l>
     <l n="94">Their longing souls relieved ,</l>
     <l n="95">And soon , with rapture and with pride ,</l>
     <l n="96">Each royal dame conceived .</l>
     <l n="97">He gazed upon each lady 's face ,</l>
     <l n="98">And triumphed as he gazed .</l>
     <l n="99">As Indra in his royal place</l>
     <l n="100">By Gods and spirits praised .</l>

     <l n="17">A monarch from his throne expelled</l>
     <l n="18">No better than the dead is held .</l>
     <l n="19">So he who cares for power and might</l>
     <l n="20">Must guard his realm and royal right .</l>
     <l n="21">Such care a meed in heaven will bring</l>
     <l n="22">Better than rites and offering .</l>
     <l n="23">Such care a king his country owes</l>
     <l n="24">As man upon himself bestows ,</l>
     <l n="25">When for his body he provides</l>
     <l n="26">Raiment and every need besides .</l>
     <l n="27">For future days should kings foresee ,</l>
     <l n="28">And keep the present error-free . ”</l>

     <l n="71">The sage 's son had let prepare</l>
     <l n="72">A lodge within the wood , and there</l>
     <l n="73">Awhile they lingered blithe and gay ,</l>
     <l n="74">Then , duly honored , went their way .</l>
     <l n="75">The glorious hermit Rishyaśring</l>
     <l n="76">Drew near and thus besought the King :—</l>

     <l n="81">And with eyes dripping still to each</l>

     <l n="87">To ‘ Śántá 's side the ladies leapt ,</l>

     <l n="129">Amid his people 's loud acclaim</l>
     <l n="130">Home to his royal seat he came ,</l>

     <l n="134">Her promised son should bear .</l>
     <l n="135">The glorious sage his way pursued</l>

     <l n="153">The King and Rishyaśring elate</l>
     <l n="154">Entered the royal city 's gate —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The monarch called a Bráhman near</l>
     <l n="2">And said , “ Now speed away</l>
     <l n="3">To Kaśyap 's son , the mighty seer ,</l>
     <l n="4">And with all reverence say —</l>
     <l n="5">The holy child he holds so dear ,</l>
     <l n="6">The hermit of the noble mind ,</l>
     <l n="7">Whose equal it were hard to find ,</l>

     <l n="9">Go , and instead of me do thou</l>
     <l n="10">Before that best of hermits bow ,</l>
     <l n="11">That still he may for his dear son ,</l>
     <l n="12">Show me the favor I have won . ”</l>
     <l n="13">Soon as the King these words had said ,</l>
     <l n="14">To Kaśyap 's son the Bráhman sped .</l>
     <l n="15">Before the hermit low he bent</l>
     <l n="16">And did obeisance , reverent ;</l>
     <l n="17">Then with meek words his grace to crave</l>
     <l n="18">The message of his lord he gave :—</l>
     <l n="19">“ The high-souled father of his bride</l>
     <l n="20">Had called thy son his rites to guide —</l>
     <l n="21">Those rites are o'er , the steed is slain ;</l>
     <l n="22">Thy noble child is come again . ”</l>
     <l n="23">Soon as the saint that speech had heard</l>
     <l n="24">His spirit with desire was stirred</l>
     <l n="25">To seek the city of the King</l>
     <l n="26">And to his cot his son to bring .</l>
     <l n="27">With young disciples at his side</l>
     <l n="28">Forth on his way the hermit hied ,</l>
     <l n="29">While peasants from their hamlets ran</l>
     <l n="30">To reverence the holy man .</l>
     <l n="31">Each with his little gift of food ,</l>
     <l n="32">Forth came the village multitude ,</l>
     <l n="33">And , as they humbly bowed the head ,</l>
     <l n="34">“ What may we do for thee ? ” they said .</l>
     <l n="35">Then he , of Bráhmans first and best ,</l>
     <l n="36">The gathered people thus addressed :—</l>
     <l n="37">“ Now tell me , for I fain would know ,</l>
     <l n="38">Why is it I am honored so ? ”</l>
     <l n="39">They to the high-souled saint replied :—</l>
     <l n="40">“ Our ruler is with thee allied .</l>
     <l n="41">Our master 's order we fulfil ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="43">With joy the saintly hermit heard</l>
     <l n="44">Each pleasant and delightful word ,</l>
     <l n="45">And poured a benediction down</l>
     <l n="46">On King and ministers and town .</l>
     <l n="47">Glad at the words of that high saint</l>
     <l n="48">Some servants hastened to acquaint</l>
     <l n="49">Their King , rejoicing to impart</l>
     <l n="50">The tidings that would cheer his heart .</l>
     <l n="51">Soon as the joyful tale he knew</l>
     <l n="52">To meet the saint the monarch flew ,</l>
     <l n="53">The guest-gift in his hand he brought ,</l>
     <l n="54">And bowed before him and besought :—</l>
     <l n="55">“ This day by seeing thee I gain</l>
     <l n="56">Not to have lived my life in vain .</l>
     <l n="57">Now be not wroth with me , I pray ,</l>
     <l n="58">Because I wiled thy son away . ”</l>
     <l n="59">The best of Bráhmans answer made :—</l>
     <l n="60">“ Be not , great lord of Kings , afraid .</l>
     <l n="61">Thy virtues have not failed to win</l>
     <l n="62">My favor , O thou pure of sin . ”</l>
     <l n="63">Then in the front the saint was placed ,</l>
     <l n="64">The King came next in joyous haste ,</l>
     <l n="65">And with him entered his abode ,</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Mid glad acclaim as on they rode .</l>
     <l n="67">To greet the sage the reverent crowd</l>
     <l n="68">Raised suppliant hands and humbly bowed .</l>
     <l n="69">Then from the palace many a dame</l>
     <l n="70">Following well-dressed Śántá came ,</l>
     <l n="71">Stood by the mighty saint and cried :—</l>
     <l n="72">“ See , honor 's source , thy son 's dear bride . ”</l>
     <l n="73">The saint , who every virtue knew ,</l>
     <l n="74">His arms around his daughter threw ,</l>
     <l n="75">And with a father 's rapture pressed</l>
     <l n="76">The lady to his wondering breast .</l>
     <l n="77">Arising from the saint 's embrace</l>
     <l n="78">She bowed her low before his face ,</l>
     <l n="79">And then , with palm to palm applied ,</l>
     <l n="80">Stood by her hermit father 's side .</l>
     <l n="81">He for his son , as laws ordain ,</l>
     <l n="82">Performed the rite that frees from stain ,</l>
     <l n="83">And , honored by the wise and good ,</l>
     <l n="84">With him departed to the wood .</l>

     <l n="13">Their morning task completed , they</l>
     <l n="14">To Viśvámitra came ,</l>
     <l n="15">That store of holy works , to pay</l>
     <l n="16">The worship saints may claim .</l>
     <l n="17">Then to the hallowed spot they went</l>
     <l n="18">Along fair Sarjú 's side</l>
     <l n="19">Where mix her waters confluent</l>
     <l n="20">With three-pathed Gangá 's tide .</l>
     <l n="21">There was a sacred hermitage</l>
     <l n="22">Where saints devout of mind</l>
     <l n="23">Their lives through many a lengthened age</l>
     <l n="24">To penance had resigned .</l>
     <l n="25">That pure abode the princes eyed</l>
     <l n="26">With unrestrained delight ,</l>
     <l n="27">And thus unto the saint they cried ,</l>
     <l n="28">Rejoicing at the sight :—</l>
     <l n="29">“ Whose is that hermitage we see ?</l>
     <l n="30">Who makes his dwelling there ?</l>
     <l n="31">Full of desire to hear are we :</l>
     <l n="32">O Saint , the truth declare . ”</l>
     <l n="33">The hermit , smiling , made reply</l>
     <l n="34">To the two boys ’ request :—</l>
     <l n="35">“ Hear , Ráma , who in days gone by</l>
     <l n="36">This calm retreat possessed —</l>
     <l n="37">Kandarpa in apparent form ,</l>
     <l n="38">( Called Káma by the wise ,)</l>

     <l n="42">And vows intent , they say ,</l>
     <l n="43">His bold rash hand he dared to rear ,</l>
     <l n="44">Though Sthánu cried , Away !</l>
     <l n="45">But the God 's eye with scornful glare</l>
     <l n="46">Fell terrible on him ,</l>
     <l n="47">Dissolved the shape that was so fair</l>
     <l n="48">And burnt up every limb .</l>
     <l n="49">Since the great God 's terrific rage</l>
     <l n="50">Destroyed his form and frame ,</l>
     <l n="51">Káma in each succeeding age</l>
     <l n="52">Has borne Ananga 's name .</l>
     <l n="53">So , where his lovely form decayed ,</l>
     <l n="54">This land is Anga styled :—</l>
     <l n="55">Sacred to him of old this shade ,</l>
     <l n="56">And hermits undefiled .</l>
     <l n="57">Here Scripture-talking elders sway</l>
     <l n="58">Each sense with firm control ,</l>
     <l n="59">And penance-rites have washed away</l>
     <l n="60">All sin from every soul .</l>
     <l n="61">One night , fair boy , we here will spend ,</l>
     <l n="62">A pure stream on each hand ,</l>
     <l n="63">And with to-morrow 's light will bend</l>
     <l n="64">Our steps to yonder strand .</l>
     <l n="65">Here let us bathe , and free from stain</l>
     <l n="66">To that pure grove repair ,</l>
     <l n="67">Sacred to Káma , and remain</l>
     <l n="68">One night in comfort there . ”</l>
     <l n="69">With penance ’ far-discerning eye</l>
     <l n="70">The saintly men beheld</l>
     <l n="71">Their coming , and with transport high</l>
     <l n="72">Each holy bosom swelled .</l>
     <l n="73">To Kuśik 's son the gift they gave</l>
     <l n="74">That honored guest should greet —</l>
     <l n="75">Water they brought his feet to lave ,</l>
     <l n="76">And showed him honor meet .</l>
     <l n="77">Ráma and Lakshman next obtained</l>
     <l n="78">In due degree their share —</l>
     <l n="79">Then with sweet talk the guests remained ,</l>
     <l n="80">And charmed each listener there .</l>
     <l n="81">The evening prayers were duly said</l>
     <l n="82">With voices calm and low :—</l>
     <l n="83">Then on the ground each laid his head</l>
     <l n="84">And slept till morning 's glow .</l>

     <l n="1">When the fair light of morning rose</l>
     <l n="2">The princely tamers of their foes</l>
     <l n="3">Followed , his morning worship o'er ,</l>
     <l n="4">The hermit to the river 's shore .</l>
     <l n="5">The high-souled men with thoughtful care</l>
     <l n="6">A pretty barge had stationed there .</l>
     <l n="7">All cried , “ O lord , this barge ascend ,</l>
     <l n="8">And with thy princely followers bend</l>
     <l n="9">To yonder side thy prosperous way —</l>
     <l n="10">With nought to check thee or delay . ”</l>
     <l n="11">Nor did the saint their rede reject :</l>
     <l n="12">He bade farewell with due respect ,</l>
     <l n="13">And crossed , attended by the twain ,</l>
     <l n="14">That river rushing to the main .</l>
     <l n="15">When now the bark was half-way o'er ,</l>
     <l n="16">Ráma and Lakshman heard the roar ,</l>
     <l n="17">That louder grew and louder yet ,</l>
     <l n="18">Of waves by dashing waters met .</l>
     <l n="19">Then Ráma asked the mighty seer :—</l>
     <l n="20">“ What is the tumult that I hear</l>
     <l n="21">Of waters cleft in mid-career ? ”</l>
     <l n="22">Soon as the speech of Ráma , stirred</l>
     <l n="23">By deep desire to know , he heard ,</l>
     <l n="24">The pious saint began to tell</l>
     <l n="25">What caused the waters ’ roar and swell :—</l>
     <l n="26">“ On high Kailása 's distant hill</l>
     <l n="27">There lies a noble lake</l>
     <l n="28">Whose waters , born from Brahmá 's will ,</l>
     <l n="29">The name of Mánas take .</l>
     <l n="30">Thence , hallowing where'er they flow ,</l>
     <l n="31">The streams of Sarjú fall ,</l>
     <l n="32">And wandering through the plains below</l>
     <l n="33">Embrace Ayodhyá 's wall .</l>
     <l n="34">Still , still preserved in Sarjú 's name</l>
     <l n="35">Sarovar 's fame we trace ,</l>
     <l n="36">The flood of Brahmá whence she came</l>
     <l n="37">To run her holy race .</l>
     <l n="38">To meet great Gangá here she hies</l>
     <l n="39">With tributary wave —</l>
     <l n="40">Hence the loud roar ye hear arise ,</l>
     <l n="41">Of floods that swell and rave .</l>
     <l n="42">Here , pride of Raghu 's line , do thou</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="44">He spoke . The princes both obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="45">And reverence to each river paid .</l>
     <l n="46">They reached the southern shore at last ,</l>
     <l n="47">And gayly on their journey passed .</l>
     <l n="48">A little space beyond there stood</l>
     <l n="49">A gloomy awe-inspiring wood .</l>
     <l n="50">The monarch 's noble son began</l>
     <l n="51">To question thus the holy man :—</l>
     <l n="52">“ Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye ,</l>
     <l n="53">Like some vast cloud that fills the sky ?</l>
     <l n="54">Pathless and dark it seems to be ,</l>
     <l n="55">Where birds in thousands wander free ;</l>
     <l n="56">Where shrill cicadas ’ cries resound ,</l>
     <l n="57">And fowl of dismal note abound .</l>
     <l n="58">Lion , rhinoceros , and bear ,</l>
     <l n="59">Boar , tiger , elephant , are there ,</l>
     <l n="60">There shrubs and thorns run wild :</l>
     <l n="61">Dháo , Sál , Bignonia , Bel , are found ,</l>
     <l n="62">And every tree that grows on ground :</l>
     <l n="63">How is the forest styled ? ”</l>
     <l n="64">The glorious saint this answer made :—</l>
     <l n="65">“ Dear child of Raghu , hear</l>
     <l n="66">Who dwells within the horrid shade</l>
     <l n="67">That looks so dark and drear .</l>
     <l n="68">Where now is wood , long ere this day</l>
     <l n="69">Two broad and fertile lands ,</l>
     <l n="70">Malaja and Karúsha lay ,</l>
     <l n="71">Adorned by heavenly hands .</l>
     <l n="72">Here , mourning friendship 's broken ties ,</l>
     <l n="73">Lord Indra of the thousand eyes</l>
     <l n="74">Hungered and sorrowed many a day ,</l>
     <l n="75">His brightness soiled with mud and clay ,</l>
     <l n="76">When in a storm of passion he</l>
     <l n="77">Had slain his dear friend Namuchi .</l>
     <l n="78">Then came the Gods and saints who bore</l>
     <l n="79">Their golden pitchers brimming o'er</l>
     <l n="80">With holy streams that banish stain ,</l>
     <l n="81">And bathed Lord Indra pure again .</l>
     <l n="82">When in this land the God was freed</l>
     <l n="83">From spot and stain of impious deed</l>
     <l n="84">For that his own dear friend he slew ,</l>
     <l n="85">High transport thrilled his bosom through .</l>
     <l n="86">Then in his joy the lands he blessed ,</l>
     <l n="87">And gave a boon they long possessed :—</l>
     <l n="88">“ Because these fertile lands retain</l>
     <l n="89">The washings of the blot and stain ,</l>

     <l n="93">My malady and care . ”</l>
     <l n="94">“ So be it , ” all the Immortals cried ,</l>
     <l n="95">When Indra 's speech they heard —</l>
     <l n="96">And with acclaim they ratified</l>
     <l n="97">The names his lips conferred .</l>
     <l n="98">“ Long time , O victor of thy foes ,</l>
     <l n="99">These happy lands had sweet repose ,</l>

     <l n="101">At length a spirit , loving ill ,</l>

     <l n="107">From her , Lord Indra 's peer in might</l>
     <l n="108">Giant Márícha sprang to light ;</l>
     <l n="109">And she , a constant plague and pest ,</l>
     <l n="110">These two fair realms has long distressed .</l>
     <l n="111">Now dwelling in her dark abode</l>
     <l n="112">A league away she bars the road :</l>
     <l n="113">And we , O Ráma , hence must go</l>
     <l n="114">Where lies the forest of the foe .</l>
     <l n="115">Now on thine own right arm rely ,</l>

    <head>THE BIRTH OF TÁDAKÁ</head>
     <l n="1">When thus the sage without a peer</l>
     <l n="2">Had closed that story strange to hear ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ráma again the saint addressed ,</l>
     <l n="4">To set one lingering doubt at rest :—</l>

     <l n="9">And Viśvámitra thus replied</l>
     <l n="10">To Raghu 's son , the glorified :—</l>
     <l n="11">“ Listen , and I will tell thee how</l>
     <l n="12">She gained the strength that arms her now .</l>

     <l n="15">Childless was he , and free from crime</l>
     <l n="16">In rites austere he passed his time .</l>
     <l n="17">The mighty Sire was pleased to show</l>
     <l n="18">His favor , and a child bestow ,</l>
     <l n="19">Tádaká named , most fair to see ,</l>
     <l n="20">A pearl among the maids was she —</l>
     <l n="21">And matched , for such was Brahmá 's dower ,</l>
     <l n="22">A thousand elephants in power .</l>
     <l n="23">Nor would the Eternal Sire , although</l>
     <l n="24">The spirit longed , a son bestow .</l>
     <l n="25">That maid in beauty 's youthful pride</l>
     <l n="26">Was given to Sunda for a bride .</l>

     <l n="13">Thus spoke the tamer of the foe ,</l>

     <l n="21">In wild amaze , her soul aflame</l>
     <l n="22">With fury towards the spot she came .</l>
     <l n="23">When that foul shape of evil mien</l>
     <l n="24">And stature vast as e'er was seen</l>
     <l n="25">The wrathful son of Raghu eyed ,</l>
     <l n="26">He thus unto his brother cried :—</l>

     <l n="31">Behold the demon hard to smite ,</l>
     <l n="32">Defended by her magic might .</l>

     <l n="39">While thus he spoke , by rage impelled —</l>
     <l n="40">Roaring as she came nigh ,</l>
     <l n="41">The fiend her course at Ráma held</l>
     <l n="42">With huge arms tossed on high .</l>
     <l n="43">Her , rushing on , the seer assailed</l>

     <l n="51">Then calling on her magic power</l>
     <l n="52">The fearful fight to wage ,</l>
     <l n="53">She smote him with a stony shower ,</l>
     <l n="54">Till Ráma burned with rage .</l>
     <l n="55">Then pouring forth his arrowy rain</l>
     <l n="56">That stony flood to stay ,</l>
     <l n="57">With wingèd darts , as she charged amain ,</l>
     <l n="58">He shore her hands away .</l>
     <l n="59">As Tádaká still thundered near</l>
     <l n="60">Thus maimed by Ráma 's blows ,</l>
     <l n="61">Lakshman in fury severed sheer</l>
     <l n="62">The monster 's ears and nose .</l>
     <l n="63">Assuming by her magic skill</l>
     <l n="64">A fresh and fresh disguise ,</l>
     <l n="65">She tried a thousand shapes at will ,</l>
     <l n="66">Then vanished from their eyes .</l>
     <l n="67">When Gádhi 's son of high renown</l>
     <l n="68">Still saw the stony rain pour down</l>
     <l n="69">Upon each princely warrior 's head ,</l>
     <l n="70">With words of wisdom thus he said :—</l>
     <l n="71">“ Enough of mercy , Ráma , lest</l>
     <l n="72">This sinful evil-working pest ,</l>
     <l n="73">Disturber of each holy rite ,</l>
     <l n="74">Repair by magic arts her might .</l>
     <l n="75">Without delay the fiend should die ,</l>
     <l n="76">For , see , the twilight hour is nigh .</l>
     <l n="77">And at the joints of night and day</l>
     <l n="78">Such giant foes are hard to slay . ”</l>
     <l n="79">Then Ráma , skilful to direct</l>
     <l n="80">His arrow to the sound —</l>
     <l n="81">With shafts the mighty demon checked</l>
     <l n="82">Who rained her stones around .</l>
     <l n="83">She , sore impeded and beset</l>
     <l n="84">By Ráma and his arrowy net —</l>
     <l n="85">Though skilled in guile and magic lore ,</l>
     <l n="86">Rushed on the brothers with a roar .</l>
     <l n="87">Deformed , terrific , murderous , dread ,</l>
     <l n="88">Swift as the levin on she sped —</l>
     <l n="89">Like cloudy pile in autumn 's sky ,</l>
     <l n="90">Lifting her two vast arms on high :</l>
     <l n="91">When Ráma smote her with a dart</l>
     <l n="92">Shaped like a crescent , to the heart .</l>
     <l n="93">Sore wounded by the shaft that came</l>
     <l n="94">With lightning speed and surest aim ,</l>
     <l n="95">Blood spurting from her mouth and side ,</l>
     <l n="96">She fell upon the earth and died .</l>
     <l n="97">Soon as the Lord who rules the sky</l>
     <l n="98">Saw the dread monster lifeless lie ,</l>
     <l n="99">He called aloud , Well done ! well done !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thus spoke the prince of boundless might ,</l>
     <l n="2">And thus replied the anchorite :—</l>
     <l n="3">“ Chief of the mighty arm , of yore</l>
     <l n="4">Lord Vishnu , whom the Gods adore</l>
     <l n="5">For holy thought and rites austere ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of penance made his dwelling here .</l>
     <l n="7">This ancient wood was called of old</l>
     <l n="8">Grove of the Dwarf , the mighty-souled —</l>
     <l n="9">And when perfection he attained</l>
     <l n="10">The grove the name of Perfect gained .</l>
     <l n="11">Bali of yore , Virochan 's son ,</l>
     <l n="12">Dominion over Indra won —</l>
     <l n="13">And when with power his proud heart swelled ,</l>
     <l n="14">O'er the three worlds his empire held .</l>
     <l n="15">When Bali then began a rite ,</l>
     <l n="16">The Gods and Indra in affright</l>
     <l n="17">Sought Vishnu in this place of rest ,</l>
     <l n="18">And thus with prayers the God addressed :—</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Bali , Virochan 's mighty son ,</l>
     <l n="20">His sacrifice has now begun :</l>
     <l n="21">Of boundless wealth , that demon king</l>
     <l n="22">Is bounteous to each living thing .</l>
     <l n="23">Though suppliants flock from every side</l>
     <l n="24">The suit of none is e'er denied .</l>
     <l n="25">Whate'er , where'er , howe'er the call ,</l>
     <l n="26">He hears the suit and gives to all .</l>
     <l n="27">Now with thine own illusive art</l>
     <l n="28">Perform , O Lord , the helper 's part :</l>
     <l n="29">Assume a dwarfish form , and thus</l>
     <l n="30">From fear and danger rescue us . ’</l>
     <l n="31">Thus in their dread the Immortals sued</l>
     <l n="32">The God , a dwarfish shape indued :—</l>
     <l n="33">Before Virochan 's son he came ,</l>
     <l n="34">Three steps of land his only claim .</l>
     <l n="35">The boon obtained , in wondrous wise</l>
     <l n="36">Lord Vishnu 's form increased in size ;</l>
     <l n="37">Through all the worlds , tremendous , vast ,</l>
     <l n="38">God of the Triple Step , he passed .</l>
     <l n="39">The whole broad earth from side to side</l>
     <l n="40">He measured with one mighty stride —</l>
     <l n="41">Spanned with the next the firmament ,</l>
     <l n="42">And with the third through heaven he went .</l>
     <l n="43">Thus was the king of demons hurled</l>
     <l n="44">By Vishnu to the nether world —</l>
     <l n="45">And thus the universe restored</l>
     <l n="46">To Indra 's rule , its ancient lord .</l>
     <l n="47">And now because the Immortal God</l>
     <l n="48">This spot in dwarflike semblance trod ,</l>
     <l n="49">The grove has aye been loved by me</l>
     <l n="50">For reverence of the devotee .</l>
     <l n="51">But demons haunt it , prompt to stay</l>
     <l n="52">Each holy offering I would pay .</l>
     <l n="53">Be thine , O lion-lord , to kill</l>
     <l n="54">These giants that delight in ill .</l>
     <l n="55">This day , beloved child , our feet</l>
     <l n="56">Shall rest within the calm retreat ;</l>
     <l n="57">And know , thou chief of Raghu 's line ,</l>
     <l n="58">My hermitage is also thine . ”</l>
     <l n="59">He spoke ; and soon the anchorite ,</l>
     <l n="60">With joyous looks that beamed delight ,</l>
     <l n="61">With Ráma and his brother stood</l>
     <l n="62">Within the consecrated wood .</l>
     <l n="63">Soon as they saw the holy man ,</l>
     <l n="64">With one accord together ran</l>
     <l n="65">The dwellers in the sacred shade ,</l>
     <l n="66">And to the saint their reverence paid —</l>
     <l n="67">And offered water for his feet ,</l>

     <l n="72">Rested awhile in sweet repose —</l>

     <l n="1">That conquering pair , of royal race ,</l>
     <l n="2">Skilled to observe due time and place —</l>
     <l n="3">To Kúśik 's hermit son addressed ,</l>
     <l n="4">In timely words , their meet request :—</l>
     <l n="5">“ When must we , lord , we pray thee tell ,</l>
     <l n="6">Those Rovers of the Night repel ?</l>
     <l n="7">Speak , lest we let the moment fly ,</l>
     <l n="8">And pass the due occasion by . ”</l>
     <l n="9">Thus longing for the strife , they prayed ,</l>
     <l n="10">And thus the hermit 's answer made :—</l>
     <l n="11">“ Till the fifth day be come and past ,</l>
     <l n="12">O Raghu 's sons , your watch must last .</l>
     <l n="13">The saint his Díkshá has begun ,</l>

     <l n="15">Soon as the steadfast devotees</l>
     <l n="16">Had made reply in words like these ,</l>
     <l n="17">The youths began , disdaining sleep ,</l>
     <l n="18">Six days and nights their watch to keep —</l>
     <l n="19">The warrior pair who tamed the foe ,</l>
     <l n="20">Unrivalled benders of the bow ,</l>
     <l n="21">Kept watch and ward unwearied still</l>
     <l n="22">To guard the saint from scathe and ill .</l>
     <l n="23">Twas now the sixth returning day ,</l>
     <l n="24">The hour foretold had passed away .</l>
     <l n="25">Then Ráma cried : “ O Lakshman , now !</l>
     <l n="26">Firm , watchful , resolute be thou .</l>
     <l n="27">The fiends as yet have kept afar</l>
     <l n="28">From the pure grove in which we are ;</l>
     <l n="29">Yet waits us , ere the day shall close ,</l>
     <l n="30">Dire battle with the demon foes . ”</l>
     <l n="31">While thus spoke Ráma , borne away</l>
     <l n="32">By longing for the deadly fray ,</l>
     <l n="33">See ! bursting from the altar came</l>
     <l n="34">The sudden glory of the flame ;</l>
     <l n="35">Round priest and deacon , and upon</l>
     <l n="36">Grass , ladles , flowers , the splendor shone —</l>
     <l n="37">And the high rite , in order due ,</l>
     <l n="38">With sacred texts began anew .</l>
     <l n="39">But then a loud and fearful roar</l>
     <l n="40">Re-echoed through the sky ;</l>
     <l n="41">And like vast clouds that shadow o'er</l>
     <l n="42">The heavens in dark July ,</l>
     <l n="43">Involved in gloom of magic might</l>
     <l n="44">Two fiends rushed on amain —</l>
     <l n="45">Márícha , Rover of the Night ,</l>
     <l n="46">Suváhu , and their train .</l>
     <l n="47">As on they came in wild career</l>
     <l n="48">Thick blood in rain they shed ;</l>
     <l n="49">And Ráma saw those things of fear</l>
     <l n="50">Impending overhead . Then , soon as those accursed two</l>
     <l n="51">Who showered down blood he spied ,</l>
     <l n="52">Thus to his brother brave and true</l>
     <l n="53">Spoke Ráma lotus-eyed :—</l>
     <l n="54">“ Now , Lakshman , thou these fiends shalt see ,</l>
     <l n="55">Man-eaters , foul of mind ,</l>
     <l n="56">Before my mortal weapon flee</l>
     <l n="57">Like clouds before the wind . ”</l>
     <l n="58">He spoke . An arrow , swift as thought ,</l>
     <l n="59">Upon his bow he pressed ,</l>
     <l n="60">And smote , to utmost fury wrought ,</l>
     <l n="61">Márícha on the breast .</l>
     <l n="62">Deep in his flesh the weapon lay</l>
     <l n="63">Winged by the mystic spell ,</l>
     <l n="64">And , hurled a hundred leagues away ,</l>
     <l n="65">In ocean 's flood he fell .</l>
     <l n="66">Then Ráma , when he saw the foe</l>
     <l n="67">Convulsed and mad with pain</l>
     <l n="68">‘ Neath the chill-pointed weapon 's blow ,</l>
     <l n="69">To Lakshman spoke again :—</l>
     <l n="70">“ See , Lakshman , see ! this mortal dart</l>
     <l n="71">That strikes a numbing chill ,</l>
     <l n="72">Hath struck him senseless with the smart ,</l>
     <l n="73">But left him breathing still .</l>
     <l n="74">But these who love the evil way</l>
     <l n="75">And drink the blood they spill ,</l>
     <l n="76">Rejoicing holy rites to stay ,</l>
     <l n="77">Fierce plagues , my hand shall kill . ”</l>
     <l n="78">He seized another shaft , the best ,</l>
     <l n="79">Aglow with living flame ;</l>
     <l n="80">It struck Suváhu on the chest ,</l>
     <l n="81">And dead to earth he came .</l>
     <l n="82">Again a dart , the Wind-God 's own ,</l>
     <l n="83">Upon his string he laid ,</l>
     <l n="84">And all the demons were overthrown —</l>
     <l n="85">The saints no more afraid .</l>
     <l n="86">When thus the fiends were slain in fight ,</l>
     <l n="87">Disturbers of each holy rite ,</l>
     <l n="88">Due honor by the saints was paid</l>
     <l n="89">To Ráma for his wondrous aid :—</l>
     <l n="90">So Indra is adored when he</l>
     <l n="91">Has won some glorious victory .</l>
     <l n="92">Success at last the rite had crowned ,</l>
     <l n="93">And Viśvámitra gazed around —</l>
     <l n="94">And seeing every side at rest ,</l>
     <l n="95">The son of Raghu thus addressed :—</l>
     <l n="96">“ My joy , O Prince , is now complete —</l>

     <l n="19">Thou , Prince of men , with us shalt go ,</l>
     <l n="20">And there behold the wondrous bow —</l>
     <l n="21">Terrific , vast , of matchless might ,</l>
     <l n="22">Which , splendid at the famous rite ,</l>
     <l n="23">The Gods assembled gave the King .</l>
     <l n="24">No giant , fiend , or God can string</l>
     <l n="25">That gem of bows , no heavenly bard ;</l>

     <l n="27">When lords of earth have longed to know</l>
     <l n="28">The virtue of that wondrous bow ,</l>
     <l n="29">The strongest sons of kings in vain</l>
     <l n="30">Have tried the mighty cord to strain .</l>
     <l n="31">This famous bow thou there shalt view ,</l>
     <l n="32">And wondrous rites shalt witness too .</l>
     <l n="33">The high-souled king who lords it o'er</l>
     <l n="34">The realm of Mithilá , of yore</l>
     <l n="35">Gained from the Gods this bow , the price</l>

     <l n="37">Won by the rite the glorious prize</l>
     <l n="38">Still in his royal palace lies —</l>
     <l n="39">Laid up in oil of precious scent</l>
     <l n="40">With aloes-wood and incense blent . ”</l>
     <l n="41">Then Ráma answering , “ Be it so , ”</l>
     <l n="42">Made ready with the rest to go .</l>
     <l n="43">The saint himself was now prepared ,</l>
     <l n="44">But ere beyond the grove he fared ,</l>
     <l n="45">He turned him and in words like these</l>
     <l n="46">Addressed the sylvan deities :—</l>
     <l n="47">“ Farewell ! each holy rite complete ,</l>
     <l n="48">I leave the hermits ’ perfect seat :</l>

     <l n="51">With reverent steps he paced around</l>
     <l n="52">The limits of the holy ground —</l>
     <l n="53">And then the mighty saint set forth</l>
     <l n="54">And took his journey to the north .</l>
     <l n="55">His pupils , deep in Scripture 's page ,</l>
     <l n="56">Followed behind the holy sage ,</l>

     <l n="75">With humble palms together laid</l>
     <l n="76">His eager supplication made :—</l>

     <l n="1">The hours of night now waning fast</l>
     <l n="2">On Śona 's pleasant shore they passed .</l>
     <l n="3">Then , when the dawn began to break .</l>

     <l n="27">And then prepared the hermit band</l>
     <l n="28">To halt upon that holy strand .</l>
     <l n="29">They bathed as Scripture bids , and paid</l>
     <l n="30">Oblations due to God and shade .</l>
     <l n="31">To Fire they burnt the offerings meet ,</l>

     <l n="49">Mená , Himálaya 's darling , graced</l>
     <l n="50">With beauty of her dainty waist .</l>
     <l n="51">Gangá was elder-born :— then came</l>
     <l n="52">The fair one known by Umá 's name .</l>
     <l n="53">Then all the Gods of heaven , in need</l>
     <l n="54">Of Gangá 's help their vows to speed ,</l>
     <l n="55">To great Himálaya came and prayed</l>
     <l n="56">The Mountain King to yield the maid .</l>
     <l n="57">He , not regardless of the weal</l>

     <l n="63">The three-pathed Gangá thus obtained ,</l>

     <l n="65">Long time the sister Umá passed</l>

     <l n="7">Sagar his name :— no child had he ,</l>

     <l n="17">With his two queens afar he went ,</l>
     <l n="18">And weary days in penance spent ,</l>
     <l n="19">Fervent , upon Himálaya 's hill</l>
     <l n="20">Where springs the stream called Bhrigu 's rill .</l>
     <l n="21">Nor did he fail that saint to please</l>
     <l n="22">With his devout austerities ,</l>
     <l n="23">And , when a hundred years had fled ,</l>
     <l n="24">Thus the most truthful Bhrigu said :—</l>
     <l n="25">‘ From thee , O Sagar , blameless King ,</l>
     <l n="26">A mighty host of sons shall spring ,</l>
     <l n="27">And thou shalt win a glorious name</l>

     <l n="29">One of thy queens a son shall bear</l>
     <l n="30">Maintainer of thy race and heir ;</l>
     <l n="31">And of the other there shall be</l>
     <l n="32">Sons sixty thousand born to thee . ’</l>
     <l n="33">Thus as he spake , with one accord ,</l>
     <l n="34">To win the grace of that high lord ,</l>
     <l n="35">The queens , with palms together laid ,</l>
     <l n="36">In humble supplication prayed :—</l>

     <l n="38">The many , or the one shall bear ?</l>
     <l n="39">Most eager , Lord , are we to know ,</l>
     <l n="40">And as thou sayest be it so , ’</l>
     <l n="41">With his sweet speech the saint replied :—</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Yourselves , O Queens , the choice decide .</l>
     <l n="43">Your own discretion freely use</l>
     <l n="44">Which shall the one or many choose :</l>
     <l n="45">One shall the race and name uphold ,</l>

     <l n="47">Which will have which ? ’ Then Keśiní</l>
     <l n="48">The mother of one heir would be .</l>
     <l n="49">Sumati , sister of the King</l>
     <l n="50">Of all the birds that ply the wing ,</l>
     <l n="51">To that illustrious Bráhman sued</l>

     <l n="23">But Indra , monarch of the skies ,</l>
     <l n="24">Veiling his form in demon guise ,</l>
     <l n="25">Came down upon the appointed day</l>

   <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
   <p>The drama is always the latest development of a national poetry — for the origin of poetry is in the religious rite , where the hymn or the ode is used to celebrate the glories of some divinity , or some hero who has been received into the circle of the gods . This at least is the case in Sanscrit as in Greek literature , where the hymn and ballad precede the epic . The epic poem becomes the stable form of poetry during the middle period in the history of literature , both in India and Greece . The union of the lyric and the epic produces the drama . The speeches uttered by the heroes in such poems as the “ Iliad ” are put into the mouths of real personages who appear in sight of the audience and represent with fitting gestures and costumes the characters of the story . The dialogue is interspersed with songs or odes , which reach their perfection in the choruses of Sophocles .</p>
   <p>The drama is undoubtedly the most intellectual , as it is the most artificial , form of poetry . The construction of the plot , and the arrangement of the action , give room for the most thoughtful and deliberate display of genius . In this respect the Greek drama stands forth as most philosophically perfect . The drama , moreover , has always been by far the most popular form of poetry ; because it aids , as much as possible , the imagination of the auditor , and for distinctness and clearness of impression stands preëminent above both the epic narrative and the emotional description of the lyric .</p>
   <p>The drama in India appears to have been a perfectly indigenous creation , although it was of very late development , and could not have appeared even so early as the Alexandrian pastorals which marked the last phase of Greek poetry . When it did appear , it never took the perfect form of the drama at Athens . It certainly borrowed as little from Greece as it did from China or Japan , and the Persians and Arabians do not appear to have produced any dramatic masterpieces . The greatest of dramatists in the Sanscrit language is undoubtedly Kálidása , whose date is placed , by different scholars , anywhere from the first to the fifth century of our era . His masterpiece , and indeed the masterpiece of the Indian drama , is the “ Śakoontalá , ” which has all the graces as well as most of the faults of Oriental poetry . There can be no doubt that to most Europeans the charm of it lies in the exquisite description of natural scenery and of that atmosphere of piety and religious calm — almost mediaeval in its austere beauty and serenity — which invests the hermit life of India . The abode of the ascetics is depicted with a pathetic grace that we only find paralleled in the “ Admetus ” of Euripides . But at the same time the construction of the drama is more like such a play as Milton 's “ Comus , ” than the closely-knit , symmetrical , and inevitable progress of such a work of consummate skill as the “ King Oedipus ” of Sophocles . Emotion , and generally the emotion of love , is the motive in the “ Śakoontalá ” of Kálidása , and different phases of feeling , rather than the struggles of energetic action , lead on to the dénouement of the play . The introduction of supernatural agencies controlling the life of the personages , leaves very little room for the development and description of human character . As the fate of the hero is dependent altogether upon the caprice of superhuman powers , the moral elements of a drama are but faintly discernible . Thus the central action of Śakoontalá hinges on the fact that the heroine , absorbed in thoughts of love , neglects to welcome with due respect the great saint Durvasas — certainly a trifling and venial fault — but he is represented as blighting her with a curse which results in all the unhappiness of the drama , and which is only ended at last by the intervention of a more powerful being . By this principle of construction the characters are reduced to mere shadow creations : beautiful as arabesques , delicate as a piece of ivory carving , tinted like the flat profiles of an Oriental fan or the pattern of a porcelain vase , but deficient in robustness and vigorous coloring . Humanity is absolutely dwarfed and its powers rendered inoperative by the crowd of supernatural creatures that control its destiny . Even in the “ Tempest ” of Shakespeare , in which the supernatural plays a greater part than in any other English drama , the strength and nobility of human character are allowed full play — and man in his fortitude , in his intellect and will , even more than in his emotions , keeps full possession of the stage , and imparts a reality to every scene which makes the wildest flight of fancy bear a real relation to the common experiences of human life .</p>
   <p>The “ Śakoontalá ” is divided into seven acts , and is a mixture of prose and verse ;— each character rising in the intensity of emotional utterance into bursts of lyric poetry . The first act introduces the King of India , Dushyanta , armed with bow and arrows , in a chariot with his driver . They are passing through a forest in pursuit of a black antelope , which they fail to overtake before the voice of some hermit forbids them to slay the creature as it belongs to the hermitage . The king piously desists and reaches the hermitage of the great saint Kanwa , who has left his companions in charge of his foster-daughter , Śakoontalá , while he is bound on a pilgrimage . Following these hermits the king finds himself within the precincts of a sacred grove , where rice is strewn on the ground to feed the parrots that nest in the hollow trunks , and where the unterrified antelopes do not start at the human voice . The king stops his chariot and alights , so as not to disturb the dwellers in the holy wood . He feels a sudden throb in his right arm , which augurs happy love , and sees hermit maidens approaching to sprinkle the young shrubs , with watering-pots suited to their strength . The forms of these hermit maidens eclipse those found in queenly halls , as the luxuriance of forest vines excels the trim vineyards of cultivation . Amongst these maidens the king , concealed by the trees , observes Śakoontalá , dressed in the bark garment of a hermit — like a blooming bud enclosed within a sheath of yellow leaves . When she stands by the keśara-tree , the king is impressed by her beauty , and regrets that she is , if of a purely Bráhmanic origin , forbidden to marry one of the warrior class , even though he be a king . A very pretty description is given of the pursuit of Śakoontalá by a bee which her sprinkling has startled from a jasmine flower . From this bee she is rescued by the king , and is dismayed to find that the sight of the stranger affects her with an emotion unsuited to the holy grove . She hurries off with her two companions , but as she goes she declares that a prickly kusa-grass has stung her foot ; a kuruvaka-bush has caught her garment , and while her companions disentangle it , she takes a long look at the king , who confesses that he cannot turn his mind from Śakoontalá . This is the opening episode of their love .</p>
   <p>The second act introduces the king 's jester , a Bráhman on confidential terms with his master , who , while Dushyanta is thinking of love , is longing to get back to the city . He is tired of the hot jungle , the nauseating water of bitter mountain streams , the racket of fowlers at early dawn , and the eternal galloping , by which his joints are bruised . The king is equally tired of hunting , and confesses that he cannot bend his bow against those fawns which dwell near Śakoontalá 's abode , and have taught their tender glance to her . He calls back the beaters sent out to surround the forest , takes off his hunting-suit , and talks to the jester about the charms of Śakoontalá — whom the Creator , he says , has formed by gathering in his mind all lovely shapes , so as to make a peerless woman-gem . He recalls the glance which she shot at him as she cried , “ a kusha-grass has stung my foot . ” Meanwhile two hermits approach him with the news that the demons have taken advantage of Kanwa 's absence to disturb the sacrifices . They request him to take up his abode in the grove for a few days , in order to vanquish the enemies . A messenger arrives to tell him that his mother , in four days , will be offering a solemn sacrifice for her son 's welfare , and invites his presence at the rite . But he cannot leave Śakoontalá , and sends the jester Máthavya in his stead , telling him to say nothing about his love for Śakoontalá .</p>
   <p>In the third act the love of the king and the hermit girl reaches its climax . The king is found walking in the hermitage , invoking the God of Love , whose shafts are flowers , though the flowery darts are hard as steel . “ Mighty God of Love , hast Thou no pity on me ? ” What better relief , he asks , than the sight of my beloved ? He traces Śakoontalá , by the broken tubes which bore the blossoms she had culled , to the arbor , enclosed by the plantation of canes , and shaded by vines , at whose entrance he observes in the sand the track of recent footsteps . Peering through the branches , he perceives her reclining on a stone seat strewn with flowers . Her two companions are with her , and she is sick unto death . The king notices that her cheeks are wasted , her breasts less swelling , her slender waist more slender , her roseate hue has grown pale , and she seems like some poor madhave creeper touched by winds that have scorched its leaves . Her companions anxiously inquire the cause of her sickness , and , after much hesitation , she reveals her love by inscribing a poem , with her fingernail , on a lotus leaf smooth as a parrot 's breast . The king hears the avowal of her love , rushes in to her , and declares his passion : adding that daughters of a royal saint have often been wedded by Gandharva rites , without ceremonies or parental consent , yet have not forfeited the father 's blessing . He thus overcomes her scruples . Gautamí , the matron of the hermitage , afterwards enters , and asks , “ My child , is your fever allayed ? ” “ Venerable mother , ” is the reply , “ I feel a grateful change . ” As the king sits in solitude that evening in the deserted arbor , he hears a voice outside , uttering the verses — “ The evening rites have begun ; but , dark as the clouds of night , the demons are swarming round the altar fires . ” With these words of ill-omen the third act comes to an end .</p>
   <p>The fourth act describes the fulfilment of this evil omen . The king has now returned to the city , and has given Śakoontalá a signet ring , with an inscription on it , pronouncing that after there have elapsed as many days as there are letters in this inscription he will return . As the two maiden companions of Śakoontalá are culling flowers in the garden of the hermitage , they hear a voice exclaiming , “ It is I ! give heed ! ” This is the great Durvasas , whom Śakoontalá , lost in thoughts of her absent husband , has neglected at once to go forth to welcome . The voice from behind the scenes is soon after heard uttering a curse — “ Woe unto her who is thus neglectful of a guest , ” and declaring that Dushyanta , of whom alone she is thinking , regardless of the presence of a pious saint , shall forget her in spite of all his love , as the wine-bibber forgets his delirium . The Hindoo saint is here described in all his arrogance and cruelty . One of the maidens says that he who had uttered the curse is now retiring with great strides , quivering with rage — for his wrath is like a consuming fire . A pretty picture is given of Śakoontalá , who carries on her finger the signet ring , which has the virtue of restoring the king 's love , if ever he should forget her . “ There sits our beloved friend , ” cries one of the maidens : “ motionless as a picture ; her cheek supported by her left hand , so absorbed in thoughts of her absent lover that she is unconscious of her own self — how much more of a passing stranger ? ”</p>
   <p>In the fourth act there is an exquisite description of the return of Kanwa from his pilgrimage , and the preparations for the start of Śakoontalá for her husband 's palace , in the city . The delicate pathos of the scene is worthy of Euripides . “ Alas ! Alas ! ” exclaim the two maidens , “ Now Śakoontalá has disappeared behind the trees of the forest . Tell us , master , how shall we enter again the sacred grove made desolate by her departure ? ” But the holy calm , broken for a moment by the excitement of his child 's departure , is soon restored to Kanwa 's mind . “ Now that my child is dismissed to her husband 's home , tranquillity regains my soul . ” The closing reflection is worthy of a Greek dramatist : “ Our maids we rear for the happiness of others ; and now that I have sent her to her husband I feel the satisfaction that comes from restoring a trust . ”</p>
   <p>In the fifth act , the scene is laid in Dushyanta 's palace , where the king is living , under the curse of Durvasas , in complete oblivion of Śakoontalá . The life of the court is happily suggested , with its intrigues and its business . The king has yet a vague impression of restlessness , which , on hearing a song sung behind the scenes , prompts him to say , “ Why has this strain flung over me so deep a melancholy , as though I was separated from some loved one ; can this be the faint remembrance of affections in some previous existence ? ” It is here that the hermits , with Gautamí , arrive , bringing Śakoontalá , soon to be made a mother , into the presence of the king ; but she has been utterly forgotten by him . He angrily denies his marriage ; and when she proposes to bring forth the ring , she finds she has lost it from her finger . “ It must have slipped off , ” suggested Gautamí , “ when thou wast offering homage to Śachí 's holy lake . ” The king smiles derisively . Śakoontalá tries to quicken his memory :— “ Do you remember how , in the jasmine bower , you poured water from the lotus cup into the hollow of my hand ? Do you remember how you said to my little fawn , Drink first , but she shrunk from you — and drank water from my hand , and you said , with a smile , ‘ Like trusts Like , ’ for you are two sisters in the same grove . ” The king calls her words “ honeyed falsehoods . ” Śakoontalá buries her face in her mantle and bursts into tears .</p>
   <p>The tenderness of this scene , its grace and delicacy , are quite idyllic , and worthy of the best ages of the pastoral drama . The ring is at length restored to Dushyanta , having been found by a fisherman in the belly of a carp . On its being restored to the king 's finger , he is overcome with a flood of recollection : he gives himself over to mourning and forbids the celebration of the Spring festival . He admits that his palsied heart had been slumbering , and that , now it is roused by memories of his fawn-eyed love , he only wakes to agonies of remorse . Meanwhile Śakoontalá had been carried away like a celestial nymph to the sacred grove of Kaśyapa , far removed from earth in the upper air . The king , being summoned by Indra to destroy the brood of giants , descendants of Kalamemi , the monster of a hundred arms and heads , reaches in the celestial car Indra , the grove where dwell his wife and child , an heroic boy whom the hermits call Sarva-damana — the all-tamer . The recognition and reconciliation of husband and wife are delineated with the most delicate skill , and the play concludes with a prayer to Shiva .</p>

   <p>RULES FOR PRONUNCIATION OF PROPER NAMES</p>
   <p>Observe , that in order to secure the correct pronunciation of the title of this Drama , “ Śakuntalá ” has been spelt “ Śa-koontalá , ” the u being pronounced like the u in the English word rule .</p>
   <p>The vowel a must invariably be pronounced with a dull sound , like the a in organ , or the u in fun , sun . Dushyanta must therefore be pronounced as if written Dooshyunta . The long vowel a is pronounced like the a in last , cart ; i like the i in pin , sin ; í like the i in marine ; e like the e in prey ; o like the o in so ; ai like the ai in aisle ; au like au in the German word baum , or like the ou in our .</p>
   <p>The consonants are generally pronounced as in English , but g has always the sound of g in gun , give , never of g in gin . S with the accent over it ( ś ) has the sound of s in sure , or of the last s in session .</p>

   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ aside to Anasúyá ] .— Who can this person be , whose lively yet dignified manner , and polite conversation , bespeak him a man of high rank ?</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— I , too , my dear , am very curious to know . I will ask him myself . [ Aloud ] . Your kind words , noble Sir , fill me with confidence , and prompt me to inquire of what regal family our noble guest is the ornament ? what country is now mourning his absence ? and what induced a person so delicately nurtured to expose himself to the fatigue of visiting this grove of penance ?</p>

   <p>KING [ aside ] .— How now shall I reply ? shall I make myself known , or shall I still disguise my real rank ? I have it ; I will answer her thus . [ Aloud ] .

   <p>MÁTHAVYA [ sighing ] .— Heigh-ho ! what an unlucky fellow I am ! worn to a shadow by my royal friend 's sporting propensities . “ Here 's a deer ! ” “ There goes a boar ! ” “ Yonder 's a tiger ! ” This is the only burden of our talk , while in the heat of the meridian sun we toil on from jungle to jungle , wandering about in the paths of the woods , where the trees afford us no shelter . Are we thirsty ? We have nothing to drink but the foul water of some mountain stream , filled with dry leaves which give it a most pungent flavor . Are we hungry ? We have nothing to eat but roast game , which we must swallow down at odd times , as best we can . Even at night there is no peace to be had . Sleeping is out of the question , with joints all strained by dancing attendance upon my sporting friend ; or if I do happen to doze , I am awakened at the very earliest dawn by the horrible din of a lot of rascally beaters and huntsmen , who must needs surround the wood before sunrise , and deafen me with their clatter . Nor are these my only troubles . Here 's a fresh grievance , like a new boil rising upon an old one ! Yesterday , while we were lagging behind , my royal friend entered yonder hermitage after a deer ; and there , as ill-luck would have it ? caught sight of a beautiful girl , called Śakoontalá , the hermit 's daughter . From that moment , not another thought about returning to the city ! and all last night , not a wink of sleep did he get for thinking of the damsel . What is to be done ? At any rate , I will be on the watch for him as soon as he has finished his toilet . [[ Walking and looking about . ] Oh ! here he comes , attended by the Yavana women with bows in their hands , and wearing garlands of wild flowers . What shall I do ? I have it .

     <l n="3">and I cannot assent to all you have said . For the present ,</l>
     <l n="4">All undisturbed the buffaloes shall sport</l>
     <l n="5">In yonder pool , and with their ponderous horns</l>
     <l n="6">Scatter its tranquil waters , while the deer ,</l>
     <l n="7">Couched here and there in groups beneath the shade</l>
     <l n="8">Of spreading branches , ruminate in peace .</l>
     <l n="9">And all securely shall the herd of boars</l>
     <l n="10">Feed on the marshy sedge ; and thou , my bow ,</l>
     <l n="11">With slackened string enjoy a long repose .</l>

   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— Now that you have got rid of these plagues , who have been buzzing about us like so many flies , sit down , do , on that stone slab , with the shade of the tree as your canopy , and I will seat myself by you quite comfortably .</p>

   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— Come along , then .</p>
   <p>[ Both walk on a little way , and seat themselves .</p>
   <p>KING .— Máthavya , it may be said of you that you have never beheld anything worth seeing : for your eyes have not yet looked upon the loveliest object in creation .</p>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— How can you say so , when I see your Majesty before me at this moment ?</p>
   <p>KING .— It is very natural that everyone should consider his own friend perfect ; but I was alluding to Śakoontalá , the brightest ornament of these hallowed groves .</p>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA [ aside ] .— I understand well enough , but I am not going to humor him . [ Aloud . ] If , as you intimate , she is a hermit 's daughter , you cannot lawfully ask her in marriage . You may as well , then , dismiss her from your mind , for any good the mere sight of her can do .</p>

     <l n="1">KING .— Think you that a descendant of the mighty Puru could fix his</l>

     <l n="3">Though , as men say , the offspring of the sage ,</l>
     <l n="4">The maiden to a nymph celestial owes</l>
     <l n="5">Her being , and by her mother left on earth ,</l>
     <l n="6">Was found and nurtured by the holy man</l>
     <l n="7">As his own daughter , in this hermitage ;—</l>
     <l n="8">So , when dissevered from its parent stalk ,</l>
     <l n="9">Some falling blossom of the jasmine , wafted</l>
     <l n="10">Upon the sturdy sunflower , is preserved</l>
     <l n="11">By its support from premature decay .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA [ smiling ] .— This passion of yours for a rustic maiden , when you have so many gems of women at home in your palace , seems to me very like the fancy of a man who is tired of sweet dates , and longs for sour tamarinds as a variety .</p>
   <p>KING .— You have not seen her , or you would not talk in this fashion .</p>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— I can quite understand it must require something surpassingly attractive to excite the admiration of such a great man as you .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">KING .— I will describe her , my dear friend , in a few words —</l>
     <l n="2">Man 's all-wise Maker , wishing to create</l>
     <l n="3">A faultless form , whose matchless symmetry</l>
     <l n="4">Should far transcend Creation 's choicest works ,</l>
     <l n="5">Did call together by his mighty will ,</l>
     <l n="6">And garner up in his eternal mind ,</l>
     <l n="7">A bright assemblage of all lovely things :—</l>
     <l n="8">And then , as in a picture , fashion them</l>
     <l n="9">Into one perfect and ideal form .</l>
     <l n="10">Such the divine , the wondrous prototype ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whence her fair shape was moulded into being .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">MÁTHAVYA .— If that 's the case , she must indeed throw all other beauties</l>
     <l n="13">into the shade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">KING .— To my mind she really does .</l>
     <l n="15">This peerless maid is like a fragrant flower ,</l>
     <l n="16">Whose perfumed breath has never been diffused ;</l>
     <l n="17">A tender bud , that no profaning hand</l>
     <l n="18">Has dared to sever from its parent stalk ;</l>
     <l n="19">A gem of priceless water , just released</l>
     <l n="20">Pure and unblemished from its glittering bed .</l>
     <l n="21">Or may the maiden haply be compared</l>
     <l n="22">To sweetest honey , that no mortal lip</l>
     <l n="23">Has sipped ; or , rather to the mellowed fruit</l>
     <l n="24">Of virtuous actions in some former birth ,</l>
     <l n="25">Now brought to full perfection ? Lives the man</l>
     <l n="26">Whom bounteous heaven has destined to espouse her ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— Make haste , then , to her aid ; you have no time to lose , if you do n't wish this fruit of all the virtues to drop into the mouth of some greasy-headed rustic of devout habits .</p>
   <p>KING .— The lady is not her own mistress , and her foster-father is not at home .</p>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— Well , but tell me , did she look at all kindly upon you ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">KING .— Maidens brought up in a hermitage are naturally shy and reserved ;</l>
     <l n="2">but for all that ,</l>
     <l n="3">She did look towards me , though she quick withdrew</l>
     <l n="4">Her stealthy glances when she met my gaze ;</l>
     <l n="5">She smiled upon me sweetly , but disguised</l>
     <l n="6">With maiden grace the secret of her smiles .</l>
     <l n="7">Coy love was half unveiled ; then , sudden checked</l>
     <l n="8">By modesty , left half to be divined .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— Why , of course , my dear friend , you never could seriously expect that at the very first sight she would fall over head and ears in love with you , and without more ado come and sit in your lap .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">KING .— When we parted from each other , she betrayed her liking for me by</l>
     <l n="2">clearer indications , but still with the utmost modesty .</l>
     <l n="3">Scarce had the fair one from my presence passed ,</l>
     <l n="4">When , suddenly , without apparent cause ,</l>
     <l n="5">She stopped , and counterfeiting pain , exclaimed ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ My foot is wounded by this prickly grass . ”</l>
     <l n="7">Then glancing at me tenderly , she feigned</l>
     <l n="8">Another charming pretext for delay ,</l>
     <l n="9">Pretending that a bush had caught her robe ,</l>
     <l n="10">And turned as if to disentangle it .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— I trust you have laid in a good stock of provisions , for I see you intend making this consecrated grove your game-preserve , and will be roaming here in quest of sport for some time to come .</p>
   <p>KING .— You must know , my good fellow , that I have been recognized by some of the inmates of the hermitage . Now I want the assistance of your fertile invention , in devising some excuse for going there again .</p>
   <lg>

     <l n="8">The tribute which my other subjects bring</l>

   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ aside to Anasúyá ] .— She is far gone in love , dear Anasúyá , and no time ought to be lost . Since she has fixed her affections on a monarch who is the ornament of Puru 's line , we need not hesitate for a moment to express our approval .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— I quite agree with you .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ aloud ] .— We wish you joy , dear Śakoontalá . Your affections are fixed on an object in every respect worthy of you . The noblest river will unite itself to the ocean , and the lovely Mádhaví-creeper clings naturally to the Mango , the only tree capable of supporting it .</p>

   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ thoughtfully ] .— An idea strikes me , Anasúyá . Let Śakoontalá write a love-letter ; I will conceal it in a flower , and contrive to drop it in the King 's path . He will surely mistake it for the remains of some sacred offering , and will , in all probability , pick it up .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— A very ingenious device ! It has my entire approval ; but what says Śakoontalá ?</p>
   <p>ŚAKOONTALÁ .— I must consider before I can consent to it .</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Enter Priyamvadá and Anasúyá in the act of gathering flowers .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— Although , dear Priyamvadá , it rejoices my heart to think that Śakoontalá has been happily united to a husband in every respect worthy of her , by the form of marriage prevalent among Indra 's celestial musicians , nevertheless , I cannot help feeling somewhat uneasy in my mind .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— How so ?</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— You know that the pious King was gratefully dismissed by the hermits on the successful termination of their sacrificial rites . He has now returned to his capital , leaving Śakoontalá under our care ; and it may be doubted whether , in the society of his royal consorts , he will not forget all that has taken place in this hermitage of ours .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— On that score be at ease . Persons of his noble nature are not so destitute of all honorable feeling . I confess , however , that there is one point about which I am rather anxious . What , think you , will father Kanwa say when he hears what has occurred ?</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— In my opinion , he will approve the marriage .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— What makes you think so ?</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— From the first , it was always his fixed purpose to bestow the maiden on a husband worthy of her ; and since heaven has given her such a husband , his wishes have been realized without any trouble to himself .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ looking at the flower-basket ] .— We have gathered flowers enough for the sacred offering , dear Anasúyá .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— Well , then , let us now gather more , that we may have wherewith to propitiate the guardian-deity of our dear Śakoontalá .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— By all means . [ They continue gathering .</p>
   <p>A VOICE [ behind the scenes ] .— Ho there ! See you not that I am here ?</p>

     <l n="6">to slight a guest like me !</l>
     <l n="7">Shall I stand here unwelcomed ; even I ,</l>
     <l n="8">A very mine of penitential merit ,</l>
     <l n="9">Worthy of all respect ? Shalt thou , rash maid ,</l>
     <l n="10">Thus set at nought the ever sacred ties</l>
     <l n="11">Of hospitality ? and fix thy thoughts</l>
     <l n="12">Upon the cherished object of thy love ,</l>

     <l n="14">He , even he of whom thou thinkest , he</l>

   </lg>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— Alas ! alas ! I fear a terrible misfortune has occurred . Śakoontalá , from absence of mind , must have offended some guest whom she was bound to treat with respect . [ Looking behind the scenes . ] Ah ! yes ; I see , and no less a person than the great sage Durvasas , who is known to be most irascible . He it is that has just cursed her , and is now retiring with hasty strides , trembling with passion , and looking as if nothing could turn him . His wrath is like a consuming fire .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— Go quickly , dear Priyamvadá , throw yourself at his feet , and persuade him to come back , while I prepare a propitiatory offering for him , with water and refreshments .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— I will . [ Exit .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ [ advancing hastily a few steps and stumbling ] .— Alas ! alas ! this comes of being in a hurry . My foot has slipped and my basket of flowers has fallen from my hand . [ Stays to gather them up .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ reëntering ] .— Well , dear Anasúyá , I have done my best ; but what living being could succeed in pacifying such a cross-grained , ill-tempered old fellow ? However , I managed to mollify him a little .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ [ smiling ] .— Even a little was much for him . Say on .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— When he refused to turn back , I implored his forgiveness in these words : “ Most venerable sage , pardon , I beseech you , this first offence of a young and inexperienced girl , who was ignorant of the respect due to your saintly character and exalted rank . ”</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— And what did he reply ?</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— “ My word must not be falsified ; but at the sight of the ring of recognition the spell shall cease . ” So saying , he disappeared .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— Oh ! then we may breathe again ; for now I think of it , the King himself , at his departure , fastened on Śakoontalá 's finger , as a token of remembrance , a ring on which his own name was engraved . She has , therefore , a remedy for her misfortune at her own command .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— Come , dear Anasúyá , let us proceed with our religious duties . [ They walk away .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ looking off the stage ] .— See , Anasúyá , there sits our dear friend , motionless as a statue , resting her face on her left hand , her whole mind absorbed in thinking of her absent husband . She can pay no attention to herself , much less to a stranger .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— Priyamvadá , let this affair never pass our lips . We must spare our dear friend 's feelings . Her constitution is too delicate to bear much emotion .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— I agree with you . Who would think of watering a tender jasmine with hot water ?</p>

     <l n="4">PUPIL .— My master , the venerable Kanwa , who is but lately returned from</l>

     <l n="7">and looking about . ] Oh ! the dawn has already broken .</l>
     <l n="8">Lo ! in one quarter of the sky , the Moon ,</l>
     <l n="9">Lord of the herbs and night-expanding flowers ,</l>
     <l n="10">Sinks towards his bed behind the western hills ;</l>
     <l n="11">While in the east , preceded by the Dawn ,</l>
     <l n="12">His blushing charioteer , the glorious Sun</l>
     <l n="13">Begins his course , and far into the gloom</l>

     <l n="20">Beneath the western sky , the full-blown flower</l>
     <l n="21">Of the night-loving lotus sheds her leaves</l>
     <l n="22">In sorrow for his loss , bequeathing nought</l>
     <l n="23">But the sweet memory of her loveliness</l>
     <l n="24">To my bereavèd sight : e'en as the bride</l>
     <l n="25">Disconsolately mourns her absent lord ,</l>
     <l n="26">And yields her heart a prey to anxious grief .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ [ entering abruptly ] .— Little as I know of the ways of the world , I cannot help thinking that King Dushyanta is treating Śakoontalá very improperly .</p>
   <p>PUPIL .— Well , I must let my revered preceptor know that it is time to offer the burnt oblation . [ Exit .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— I am broad awake , but what shall I do ? I have no energy to go about my usual occupations . My hands and feet seem to have lost their power . Well , Love has gained his object ; and Love only is to blame for having induced our dear friend , in the innocence of her heart , to confide in such a perfidious man . Possibly , however , the imprecation of Durvasas may be already taking effect . Indeed , I cannot otherwise account for the King 's strange conduct , in allowing so long a time to elapse without even a letter ; and that , too , after so many promises and protestations . I cannot think what to do , unless we send him the ring which was to be the token of recognition . But which of these austere hermits could we ask to be the bearer of it ? Then , again , Father Kanwa has just returned from his pilgrimage : and how am I to inform him of Śakoontalá 's marriage to King Dushyanta , and her expectation of being soon a mother ? I never could bring myself to tell him , even if I felt that Śakoontalá had been in fault , which she certainly has not . What is to be done ?</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ entering ; joyfully ] .— Quick ! quick ! Anasúyá ! come and assist in the joyful preparations for Śakoontalá 's departure to her husband 's palace .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— My dear girl , what can you mean ?</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— Listen , now , and I will tell you all about it . I went just now to Śakoontalá , to inquire whether she had slept comfortably —</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— Well , well ; go on .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— She was sitting with her face bowed down to the very ground with shame , when Father Kanwa entered and , embracing her , of his own accord offered her his congratulations . “ I give thee joy , my child , ” he said , “ we have had an auspicious omen . The priest who offered the oblation dropped it into the very centre of the sacred fire , though thick smoke obstructed his vision . Henceforth thou wilt cease to be an object of compassion . This very day I purpose sending thee , under the charge of certain trusty hermits , to the King 's palace ; and shall deliver thee into the hands of thy husband , as I would commit knowledge to the keeping of a wise and faithful student . ”</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— Who , then , informed the holy Father of what passed in his absence ?</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— As he was entering the sanctuary of the consecrated fire , an invisible being chanted a verse in celestial strains .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ [ with astonishment ] .— Indeed ! pray repeat it .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">PRIYAMVADÁ [ repeats the verse ] .—</l>
     <l n="2">Glows in thy daughter King Dushyanta 's glory ,</l>

     <l n="5">And may the son immortalize the sire .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ [ embracing Priyamvadá ] .— Oh , my dear Priyamvadá , what delightful news ! I am pleased beyond measure ; yet when I think that we are to lose our dear Śakoontalá this very day , a feeling of melancholy mingles with my joy .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— We shall find means of consoling ourselves after her departure . Let the dear creature only be made happy , at any cost .</p>
   <p>ANASÚYÁ .— Yes , yes , Priyamvadá , it shall be so ; and now to prepare our bridal array . I have always looked forward to this occasion , and some time since , I deposited a beautiful garland of Keśara flowers in a cocoa-nut box , and suspended it on a bough of yonder mango-tree . Be good enough to stretch out your hand and take it down , while I compound unguents and perfumes with this consecrated paste and these blades of sacred grass .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ .— Very well .</p>
   <p>[ Exit Anasúyá . Priyamvadá takes down the flowers .</p>
   <p>A VOICE [ behind the scenes ] .— Gautamí , bid Śárngarava and the others hold themselves in readiness to escort Śakoontalá .</p>

   <p>ANASÚYÁ [ reëntering , with the perfumed unguents in her hand ] .— Come along then , Priyamvadá ; I am ready to go with you . [ They walk away .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ looking ] .— See ! there sits Śakoontalá , her locks arranged even at this early hour of the morning . The holy women of the hermitage are congratulating her , and invoking blessings on her head , while they present her with wedding-gifts and offerings of consecrated wild-rice . Let us join them . [ They approach .</p>
   <p>Śakoontalá is seen seated , with women surrounding her , occupied in the manner described .</p>

   <p>SECOND WOMAN .— My child , may'st thou be the mother of a hero !</p>
   <p>THIRD WOMAN .— My child , may'st thou be highly honored by thy lord !</p>

   <p>ŚAKOONTALÁ .— Welcome , dear friends , welcome . Sit down here .</p>
   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ [ taking the baskets containing the bridal decorations , and sitting down ] .— Now , then , dearest , prepare to let us dress you . We must first rub your limbs with these perfumed unguents .</p>
   <p>ŚAKOONTALÁ .— I ought indeed to be grateful for your kind offices , now that I am so soon to be deprived of them . Dear , dear friends , perhaps I shall never be dressed by you again . [ Bursts into tears .</p>

   <p>[ They wipe away her tears and begin to dress her .</p>

     <l n="3">we went to the wood for that purpose , when</l>

     <l n="5">Appeared a robe of linen tissue , pure</l>
     <l n="6">And spotless as a moon-beam — mystic pledge</l>
     <l n="7">Of bridal happiness ; another tree</l>

   <p>PRIYAMVADÁ [ looking at Śakoontalá ] .— The wood-nymphs have done you honor , indeed .

   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— Do you not remember ? you told Chaturiká you should pass the heat of the day in the jasmine bower ; and commanded her to bring the likeness of your queen Śakoontalá , sketched with your own hand .</p>
   <p>KING .— True . The sight of her picture will refresh my soul . Lead the way to the arbor .</p>

But tell me now how it was that , between the time of my leaving her in the hermitage and my subsequent rejection of her , you never breathed her name to me ! True , you were not by my side when I disowned her ; but I had confided to you the story of my love and you were acquainted with every particular . Did it pass out of your mind as it did out of mine ?</p>
   <p>MÁTHAVYA .— No , no ; trust me for that . But , if you remember , when you had finished telling me about it , you added that I was not to take the story in earnest , for that you were not really in love with a country girl , but were only jesting ; and I was dull and thick-headed enough to believe you . But so fate decreed , and there is no help for it .</p>
   <p>SÁNUMATÍ [ aside ] .— Exactly .</p>
   <p>KING [ after deep thought ] .— My dear friend , suggest some relief for my misery .</p>

    <head>MISCELLANEOUS POEMS</head>
    <head>BY</head>
    <head>TORU DUTT</head>
    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <head>If Toru Dutt were alive , she would still be younger than any recognized European writer , and yet her fame , which is already considerable , has been entirely posthumous . Within the brief space of four years which now divides us from the date of her decease , her genius has been revealed to the world under many phases , and has been recognized throughout France and England . Her name , at least , is no longer unfamiliar in the ear of any well-read man or woman . But at the hour of her death she had published but one book , and that book had found but two reviewers in Europe . One of these , M. André Theuriet , the well-known poet and novelist , gave the “ Sheaf gleaned in French Fields ” adequate praise in the “ Revue des Deux Mondes ” ; but the other , the writer of the present notice , has a melancholy satisfaction in having been a little earlier still in sounding the only note of welcome which reached the dying poetess from England . It was while Professor W. Minto was editor of the “ Examiner , ” that one day in August , 1876 , in the very heart of the dead season for books , I happened to be in the office of that newspaper , and was upbraiding the whole body of publishers for issuing no books worth reviewing . At that moment the postman brought in a thin and sallow packet with a wonderful Indian postmark on it , and containing a most unattractive orange pamphlet of verse , printed at Bhowanipore , and entitled “ A Sheaf gleaned in French Fields , by Toru Dutt . ” This shabby little book of some two hundred pages , without preface or introduction , seemed specially destined by its particular providence to find its way hastily into the waste-paper basket . I remember that Mr. Minto thrust it into my unwilling hands , and said “ There ! see whether you can n't make something of that . ” A hopeless volume it seemed , with its queer type , published at Bhowanipore , printed at the Saptahiksambad Press ! But when at last I took it out of my pocket , what was my surprise and almost rapture to open at such verse as this :—</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Still barred thy doors ! The far East glows ,</l>
     <l n="2">The morning wind blows fresh and free .</l>
     <l n="3">Should not the hour that wakes the rose</l>
     <l n="4">Awaken also thee ?</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="5">“ All look for thee , Love , Light , and Song ,</l>
     <l n="6">Light in the sky deep red above ,</l>
     <l n="7">Song , in the lark of pinions strong ,</l>
     <l n="8">And in my heart , true Love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Apart we miss our nature 's goal ,</l>
     <l n="10">Why strive to cheat our destinies ?</l>
     <l n="11">Was not my love made for thy soul ?</l>
     <l n="12">Thy beauty for mine eyes ?</l>
     <l n="13">No longer sleep ,</l>
     <l n="14">Oh , listen now !</l>
     <l n="15">I wait and weep ,</l>
     <l n="16">But where art thou ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>When poetry is as good as this it does not much matter whether Rouveyre prints it upon Whatman paper , or whether it steals to light in blurred type from some press in Bhowanipore .</p>
   <p>Toru Dutt was the youngest of the three children of a high-caste Hindoo couple in Bengal . Her father , who survives them all , the Baboo Govin Chunder Dutt , is himself distinguished among his countrymen for the width of his views and the vigor of his intelligence . His only son , Abju , died in 1865 , at the age of fourteen , and left his two younger sisters to console their parents . Aru , the elder daughter , born in 1854 , was eighteen months senior to Toru , the subject of this memoir , who was born in Calcutta on March 4 , 1856 . With the exception of one year 's visit to Bombay , the childhood of these girls was spent in Calcutta , at their father 's garden-house . In a poem now printed for the first time , Toru refers to the scene of her earliest memories , the circling wilderness of foliage , the shining tank with the round leaves of the lilies , the murmuring dusk under the vast branches of the central casuarina-tree . Here , in a mystical retirement more irksome to a European in fancy than to an Oriental in reality , the brain of this wonderful child was moulded . She was pure Hindoo , full of the typical qualities of her race and blood , and , as the present volume shows us for the first time , preserving to the last her appreciation of the poetic side of her ancient religion , though faith itself in Vishnu and Siva had been cast aside with childish things and been replaced by a purer faith . Her mother fed her imagination with the old songs and legends of their people , stories which it was the last labor of her life to weave into English verse ; but it would seem that the marvellous faculties of Toru 's mind still slumbered , when , in her thirteenth year , her father decided to take his daughters to Europe to learn English and French . To the end of her days Toru was a better French than English scholar . She loved France best , she knew its literature best , she wrote its language with more perfect elegance . The Dutts arrived in Europe at the close of 1869 , and the girls went to school , for the first and last time , at a French pension . They did not remain there very many months ; their father took them to Italy and England with him , and finally they attended for a short time , but with great zeal and application , the lectures for women at Cambridge . In November , 1873 , they went back to Bengal , and the four remaining years of Toru 's life were spent in the old garden-house at Calcutta , in a feverish dream of intellectual effort and imaginative production . When we consider what she achieved in these forty-five months of seclusion , it is impossible to wonder that the frail and hectic body succumbed under so excessive a strain .</p>
   <p>She brought with her from Europe a store of knowledge that would have sufficed to make an English or French girl seem learned , but which in her case was simply miraculous . Immediately on her return she began to study Sanscrit with the same intense application which she gave to all her work , and mastering the language with extraordinary swiftness , she plunged into its mysterious literature . But she was born to write , and despairing of an audience in her own language , she began to adopt ours as a medium for her thought . Her first essay , published when she was eighteen , was a monograph , in the “ Bengal Magazine , ” on Leconte de Lisle , a writer with whom she had a sympathy which is very easy to comprehend . The austere poet of “ La Mort de Valmiki ” was , obviously , a figure to whom the poet of “ Sindhu ” must needs be attracted on approaching European literature . This study , which was illustrated by translations into English verse , was followed by another on Joséphin Soulary , in whom she saw more than her maturer judgment might have justified . There is something very interesting and now , alas ! still more pathetic in these sturdy and workmanlike essays in unaided criticism . Still more solitary her work became , in July , 1874 , when her only sister , Aru , died , at the age of twenty . She seems to have been no less amiable than her sister , and if gifted with less originality and a less forcible ambition , to have been finely accomplished . Both sisters were well-trained musicians , with full contralto voices , and Aru had a faculty for design which promised well . The romance of “ Mlle . D'Arvers ” was originally projected for Aru to illustrate , but no page of this book did Aru ever see .</p>
   <p>In 1876 , as we have said , appeared that obscure first volume at Bhowanipore . The “ Sheaf gleaned in French Fields ” is certainly the most imperfect of Toru 's writings , but it is not the least interesting . It is a wonderful mixture of strength and weakness , of genius overriding great obstacles , and of talent succumbing to ignorance and inexperience . That it should have been performed at all is so extraordinary that we forget to be surprised at its inequality . The English verse is sometimes exquisite ; at other times the rules of our prosody are absolutely ignored , and it is obvious that the Hindoo poetess was chanting to herself a music that is discord in an English ear . The notes are no less curious , and to a stranger no less bewildering . Nothing could be more naive than the writer 's ignorance at some points , or more startling than her learning at others . On the whole , the attainment of the book was simply astounding . It consisted of a selection of translations from nearly one hundred French poets , chosen by the poetess herself on a principle of her own which gradually dawned upon the careful reader . She eschewed the Classicist writers as though they had never existed . For her André Chenier was the next name in chronological order after Du Bartas . Occasionally she showed a profundity of research that would have done no discredit to Mr. Saintsbury or “ le doux Assellineau . ” She was ready to pronounce an opinion on Napol le Pyrénéan or detect a plagiarism in Baudelaire . But she thought that Alexander Smith was still alive , and she was curiously vague about the career of Sainte-Beuve . This inequality of equipment was a thing inevitable to her isolation , and hardly worthy recording , except to show how laborious her mind was , and how quick to make the best of small resources .</p>
   <p>We have already seen that the “ Sheaf gleaned in French Fields ” attracted the very minimum of attention in England . In France it was talked about a little more . M. Garcin de Tassy , the famous Orientalist , who scarcely survived Toru by twelve months , spoke of it to Mlle . Clarisse Bader , author of a somewhat remarkable book on the position of women in ancient Indian society . Almost simultaneously this volume fell into the hands of Toru , and she was moved to translate it into English , for the use of Hindoos less instructed than herself . In January , 1877 , she accordingly wrote to Mlle . Bader requesting her authorization , and received a prompt and kind reply . On the 18th of March Toru wrote again to this , her solitary correspondent in the world of European literature , and her letter , which has been preserved , shows that she had already descended into the valley of the shadow of death :—</p>
   <p>“ Ma constitution n'est pas forte ; j'ai contracté une toux opiniâtre , il y a plus de deux ans , qui ne me quitte point . Cependant j'espère mettre la main à l'oeuvre bientôt . Je ne peux dire , mademoiselle , combien votre affection — car vous les aimez , votre livre et votre lettre en témoignent assez — pour mes compatriotes et mon pays me touche ; et je suis fière de pouvoir le dire que les héroïnes de nos grandes épopées sont dignes de tout honneur et de tout amour . Y a-t-il d'héroïne plus touchante , plus aimable que Sîta ? Je ne le crois pas . Quand j'entends ma mére chanter , le soir , les vieux chants de notre pays , je pleure presque toujours . La plainte de Sîta , quand , bannie pour la séconde fois , elle erre dans la vaste forêt , seule , le désespoir et l'effroi dans l'âme , est si pathétique qu'il n'y a personne , je crois , qui puisse l'entendre sans verser des larmes . Je vous envois sous ce pli deux petites traductions du Sanscrit , cette belle langue antique . Malheureusement j'ai été obligée de faire cesser mes traductions de Sanscrit , il y a six mois . Ma santé ne me permet pas de les continuer . ”</p>
   <p>These simple and pathetic words , in which the dying poetess pours out her heart to the one friend she had , and that one gained too late , seem as touching and as beautiful as any strain of Marceline Valmore 's immortal verse . In English poetry I do not remember anything that exactly parallels their resigned melancholy . Before the month of March was over , Toru had taken to her bed . Unable to write , she continued to read , strewing her sick-room with the latest European books , and entering with interest into the questions raised by the Société Asiatique of Paris , in its printed Transactions . On the 30th of July she wrote her last letter to Mlle . Clarisse Bader , and a month later , on August 30 , 1877 , at the age of twenty-one years six months and twenty-six days , she breathed her last in her father 's house in Maniktollah street , Calcutta .</p>
   <p>In the first distraction of grief it seemed as though her unequalled promise had been entirely blighted , and as though she would be remembered only by her single book . But as her father examined her papers , one completed work after another revealed itself . First a selection from the sonnets of the Comte de Grammont , translated into English , turned up , and was printed in a Calcutta magazine ; then some fragments of an English story , which were printed in another Calcutta magazine . Much more important , however , than any of these was a complete romance , written in French , being the identical story for which her sister Aru had proposed to make the illustrations . In the meantime Toru was no sooner dead than she began to be famous . In May , 1878 , there appeared a second edition of the “ Sheaf gleaned in French Fields , ” with a touching sketch of her death , by her father ; and in 1879 was published , under the editorial care of Mlle . Clarisse Bader , the romance of “ Le Journal de Mlle . D'Arvers , ” forming a handsome volume of 259 pages . This book , begun , as it appears , before the family returned from Europe , and finished nobody knows when , is an attempt to describe scenes from modern French society , but it is less interesting as an experiment of the fancy , than as a revelation of the mind of a young Hindoo woman of genius . The story is simple , clearly told , and interesting ; the studies of character have nothing French about them , but they are full of vigor and originality . The description of the hero is most characteristically Indian :—</p>
   <p>“ Il est beau en effet . Sa taille est haute , mais quelques-uns la trouveraient mince ; sa chevelure noire est bouclée et tombe jusqu'á la nuque ; ses yeux noirs sont profonds et bien fendus ; le front est noble ; la lèvre supérieure , couverte par une moustache naissante et noire , est parfaitement modelée ; son menton a quelque chose de sévère ; son teint est d'un blanc presque féminin , ce qui dénote sa haute naissance . ”</p>
   <p>In this description we seem to recognize some Surya or Soma of Hindoo mythology , and the final touch , meaningless as applied to a European , reminds us that in India whiteness of skin has always been a sign of aristocratic birth , from the days when it originally distinguished the conquering Aryas from the indigenous race of the Dasyous .</p>
   <p>As a literary composition “ Mlle . D'Arvers ” deserves high commendation . It deals with the ungovernable passion of two brothers for one placid and beautiful girl , a passion which leads to fratricide and madness . That it is a very melancholy and tragical story is obvious from this brief sketch of its contents , but it is remarkable for coherence and self-restraint no less than for vigor of treatment . Toru Dutt never sinks to melodrama in the course of her extraordinary tale , and the wonder is that she is not more often fantastic and unreal .</p>
   <p>But we believe that the original English poems will be ultimately found to constitute Toru 's chief legacy to posterity . These ballads form the last and most matured of her writings , and were left so far fragmentary at her death that the fourth and fifth in her projected series of nine were not to be discovered in any form among her papers . It is probable that she had not even commenced them . Her father , therefore , to give a certain continuity to the series , has filled up these blanks with two stories from the “ Vishnupurana , ” which originally appeared respectively in the “ Calcutta Review ” and in the “ Bengal Magazine . ” These are interesting , but a little rude in form , and they have not the same peculiar value as the rhymed octo-syllabic ballads . In these last we see Toru no longer attempting vainly , though heroically , to compete with European literature on its own ground , but turning to the legends of her own race and country for inspiration . No modern Oriental has given us so strange an insight into the conscience of the Asiatic as is presented in the story of “ Prehíad , ” or so quaint a piece of religious fancy as the ballad of “ Jogadhya Uma . ” The poetess seems in these verses to be chanting to herself those songs of her mother 's race to which she always turned with tears of pleasure . They breathe a Vedic solemnity and simplicity of temper , and are singularly devoid of that littleness and frivolity which seem , if we may judge by a slight experience , to be the bane of modern India .</p>
   <p>As to the merely technical character of these poems , it may be suggested that in spite of much in them that is rough and inchoate , they show that Toru was advancing in her mastery of English verse . Such a stanza as this , selected out of many no less skilful , could hardly be recognized as the work of one by whom the language was a late acquirement :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ What glorious trees ! The sombre saul ,</l>
     <l n="2">On which the eye delights to rest —</l>
     <l n="3">The betel-nut , a pillar tall ,</l>
     <l n="4">With feathery branches for a crest —</l>
     <l n="5">The light-leaved tamarind spreading wide —</l>
     <l n="6">The pale faint-scented bitter neem ,</l>
     <l n="7">The seemul , gorgeous as a bride ,</l>
     <l n="8">With flowers that have the ruby 's gleam . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In other passages , of course , the text reads like a translation from some stirring ballad , and we feel that it gives but a faint and discordant echo of the music welling in Toru 's brain . For it must frankly be confessed that in the brief May-day of her existence she had not time to master our language as Blanco White did , or as Chamisso mastered German . To the end of her days , fluent and graceful as she was , she was not entirely conversant with English , especially with the colloquial turns of modern speech . Often a very fine thought is spoiled for hypercritical ears by the queer turn of expression which she has innocently given to it . These faults are found to a much smaller degree in her miscellaneous poems . Her sonnets seem to me to be of great beauty , and her longer piece , entitled “ Our Casuarina Tree , ” needs no apology for its rich and mellifluous numbers .</p>
   <p>It is difficult to exaggerate when we try to estimate what we have lost in the premature death of Toru Dutt . Literature has no honors which need have been beyond the grasp of a girl who at the age of twenty-one , and in languages separated from her own by so deep a chasm , had produced so much of lasting worth . And her courage and fortitude were worthy of her intelligence . Among “ last words ” of celebrated people , that which her father has recorded , “ It is only the physical pain that makes me cry , ” is not the least remarkable , or the least significant of strong character . It was to a native of our island , and to one ten years senior to Toru , to whom it was said , in words more appropriate , surely , to her than to Oldham ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thy generous fruits , though gathered ere their prime ,</l>
     <l n="2">Still showed a quickness , and maturing time</l>
     <l n="3">But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>That mellow sweetness was all that Toru lacked to perfect her as an English poet , and of no other Oriental who has ever lived can the same be said . When the history of the literature of our country comes to be written , there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile exotic blossom of song .</p>

    <head>NEAR HASTINGS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Near Hastings , on the shingle-beach ,</l>
     <l n="2">We loitered at the time</l>
     <l n="3">When ripens on the wall the peach ,</l>
     <l n="4">The autumn 's lovely prime .</l>
     <l n="5">Far off — the sea and sky seemed blent ,</l>
     <l n="6">The day was wholly done ,</l>
     <l n="7">The distant town its murmurs sent ,</l>
     <l n="8">Strangers — we were alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">We wandered slow ; sick , weary , faint ,</l>
     <l n="10">Then one of us sat down ,</l>
     <l n="11">No nature hers , to make complaint ;—</l>
     <l n="12">The shadows deepened brown .</l>
     <l n="13">A lady past — she was not young ,</l>
     <l n="14">But oh ! her gentle face</l>
     <l n="15">No painter-poet ever sung ,</l>
     <l n="16">Or saw such saintlike grace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">She passed us — then she came again ,</l>
     <l n="18">Observing at a glance</l>
     <l n="19">That we were strangers ; one , in pain —</l>
     <l n="20">Then asked — Were we from France ?</l>
     <l n="21">We talked awhile — some roses red</l>
     <l n="22">That seemed as wet with tears ,</l>
     <l n="23">She gave my sister , and she said ,</l>
     <l n="24">God bless you both , my dears ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Sweet were the roses — sweet and full ,</l>
     <l n="26">And large as lotus flowers</l>
     <l n="27">That in our own wide tanks we cull</l>
     <l n="28">To deck our Indian bowers .</l>
     <l n="29">But sweeter was the love that gave</l>
     <l n="30">Those flowers to one unknown ,</l>
     <l n="31">I think that He who came to save</l>
     <l n="32">The gift a debt will own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">The lady 's name I do not know ,</l>
     <l n="34">Her face no more may see ,</l>
     <l n="35">But yet , oh yet I love her so !</l>
     <l n="36">Blest , happy , may she be !</l>
     <l n="37">Her memory will not depart ,</l>
     <l n="38">Though grief my years should shade ,</l>
     <l n="39">Still bloom her roses in my heart !</l>
     <l n="40">And they shall never fade !</l>

     <l n="2">Not dead — oh no — she cannot die !</l>
     <l n="3">Only a swoon , from loss of blood !</l>
     <l n="4">Levite England passes her by ,</l>
     <l n="5">Help , Samaritan ! None is nigh ;</l>
     <l n="6">Who shall staunch me this sanguine flood ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">‘ Range the brown hair , it blinds her eyne ,</l>
     <l n="8">Dash cold water over her face !</l>
     <l n="9">Drowned in her blood , she makes no sign ,</l>
     <l n="10">Give her a draught of generous wine .</l>
     <l n="11">None heed , none hear , to do this grace .</l>

     <l n="12">Head of the human column , thus</l>
     <l n="13">Ever in swoon wilt thou remain ?</l>
     <l n="14">Thought , Freedom , Truth , quenched ominous</l>

     <l n="16">Plunged in the darkness all again .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">No , she stirs !— There 's a fire in her glance ,</l>
     <l n="18">Ware , oh ware of that broken sword !</l>
     <l n="19">What , dare ye for an hour 's mischance ,</l>
     <l n="20">Gather around her , jeering France ,</l>
     <l n="21">Attila 's own exultant horde ?</l>

     <l n="22">Lo , she stands up — stands up e'en now ,</l>
     <l n="23">Strong once more for the battle-fray ,</l>
     <l n="24">Gleams bright the star , that from her brow</l>
     <l n="25">Lightens the world . Bow , nations , bow ,</l>
     <l n="26">Let her again lead on the way !</l>

    <head>THE TREE OF LIFE</head>
     <l n="1">Broad daylight , with a sense of weariness !</l>
     <l n="2">Mine eyes were closed , but I was not asleep ,</l>
     <l n="3">My hand was in my father 's , and I felt</l>
     <l n="4">His presence near me . Thus we often passed</l>
     <l n="5">In silence , hour by hour . What was the need</l>
     <l n="6">Of interchanging words when every thought</l>
     <l n="7">That in our hearts arose , was known to each ,</l>
     <l n="8">And every pulse kept time ? Suddenly there shone</l>
     <l n="9">A strange light , and the scene as sudden changed .</l>
     <l n="10">I was awake :— It was an open plain</l>
     <l n="11">Illimitable — stretching , stretching — oh , so far !</l>
     <l n="12">And o'er it that strange light — a glorious light</l>
     <l n="13">Like that the stars shed over fields of snow</l>
     <l n="14">In a clear , cloudless , frosty winter night ,</l>
     <l n="15">Only intenser in its brilliance calm .</l>
     <l n="16">And in the midst of that vast plain , I saw ,</l>
     <l n="17">For I was wide awake — it was no dream ,</l>
     <l n="18">A tree with spreading branches and with leaves</l>
     <l n="19">Of divers kinds — dead silver and live gold ,</l>
     <l n="20">Shimmering in radiance that no words may tell !</l>
     <l n="21">Beside the tree an Angel stood ; he plucked</l>
     <l n="22">A few small sprays , and bound them round my head .</l>
     <l n="23">Oh , the delicious touch of those strange leaves !</l>
     <l n="24">No longer throbbed my brows , no more I felt</l>
     <l n="25">The fever in my limbs — “ And oh , ” I cried ,</l>
     <l n="26">“ Bind too my father 's forehead with these leaves . ”</l>
     <l n="27">One leaf the Angel took and therewith touched</l>
     <l n="28">His forehead , and then gently whispered “ Nay ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">Never , oh never had I seen a face</l>
     <l n="30">More beautiful than that Angel 's , or more full</l>
     <l n="31">Of holy pity and of love divine .</l>
     <l n="32">Wondering I looked awhile — then , all at once</l>
     <l n="33">Opened my tear-dimmed eyes — When lo ! the light</l>
     <l n="34">Was gone — the light as of the stars when snow</l>
     <l n="35">Lies deep upon the ground . No more , no more ,</l>
     <l n="36">Was seen the Angel 's face . I only found</l>
     <l n="37">My father watching patient by my bed ,</l>
     <l n="38">And holding in his own , close-prest , my hand .</l>

    <head>MADAME THÉRÈSE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Written on the fly-leaf of Erckmann-Chatrian 's novel , entitled , “ Madame</l>
     <l n="2">Thérèse . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Wavered the foremost soldiers — then fell back .</l>
     <l n="4">Fallen was their leader , and loomed right before</l>
     <l n="5">The sullen Prussian cannon , grim and black ,</l>
     <l n="6">With lighted matches waving . Now , once more ,</l>
     <l n="7">Patriots and veterans !— Ah ! Tis in vain !</l>
     <l n="8">Back they recoil , though bravest of the brave ;</l>
     <l n="9">No human troops may stand that murderous rain ;</l>
     <l n="10">But who is this — that rushes to a grave ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">It is a woman — slender , tall , and brown !</l>
     <l n="12">She snatches up the standard as it falls —</l>
     <l n="13">In her hot haste tumbles her dark hair down ,</l>
     <l n="14">And to the drummer-boy aloud she calls</l>
     <l n="15">To beat the charge ; then forwards on the pont</l>
     <l n="16">They dash together ;— who could bear to see</l>
     <l n="17">A woman and a child , thus Death confront ,</l>
     <l n="18">Nor burn to follow them to victory ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">I read the story and my heart beats fast !</l>
     <l n="20">Well might all Europe quail before thee , France ,</l>
     <l n="21">Battling against oppression ! Years have passed ,</l>
     <l n="22">Yet of that time men speak with moistened glance .</l>
     <l n="23">Va-nu-pieds ! When rose high your Marseillaise</l>
     <l n="24">Man knew his rights to earth 's remotest bound ,</l>
     <l n="25">And tyrants trembled . Yours alone the praise !</l>
     <l n="26">Ah , had a Washington but then been found !</l>

    <head>SONNET</head>
     <l n="1">A sea of foliage girds our garden round ,</l>
     <l n="2">But not a sea of dull unvaried green ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sharp contrasts of all colors here are seen ;</l>
     <l n="4">The light-green graceful tamarinds abound</l>
     <l n="5">Amid the mango clumps of green profound ,</l>
     <l n="6">And palms arise , like pillars gray , between ;</l>
     <l n="7">And o'er the quiet pools the seemuls lean ,</l>
     <l n="8">Red — red , and startling like a trumpet 's sound .</l>
     <l n="9">But nothing can be lovelier than the ranges</l>
     <l n="10">Of bamboos to the eastward , when the moon</l>
     <l n="11">Looks through their gaps , and the white lotus changes</l>
     <l n="12">Into a cup of silver . One might swoon</l>
     <l n="13">Drunken with beauty then , or gaze and gaze</l>
     <l n="14">On a primeval Eden , in amaze .</l>

    <head>SONNET</head>
     <l n="1">Love came to Flora asking for a flower</l>
     <l n="2">That would of flowers be undisputed queen ,</l>
     <l n="3">The lily and the rose , long , long had been</l>
     <l n="4">Rivals for that high honor . Bards of power</l>
     <l n="5">Had sung their claims . “ The rose can never tower</l>
     <l n="6">Like the pale lily with her Juno mien ” —</l>
     <l n="7">“ But is the lily lovelier ? ” Thus between</l>
     <l n="8">Flower-factions rang the strife in Psyche 's bower .</l>
     <l n="9">“ Give me a flower delicious as the rose</l>
     <l n="10">And stately as the lily in her pride ” —</l>
     <l n="11">“ But of what color ? ” — “ Rose-red , ” Love first chose ,</l>
     <l n="12">Then prayed — “ No , lily-white — or , both provide ; ”</l>
     <l n="13">And Flora gave the lotus , “ rose-red ” dyed ,</l>
     <l n="14">And “ lily-white ” — the queenliest flower that blows .</l>

    <head>OUR CASUARINA-TREE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Like a huge Python , winding round and round</l>
     <l n="2">The rugged trunk , indented deep with scars</l>
     <l n="3">Up to its very summit near the stars ,</l>
     <l n="4">A creeper climbs , in whose embraces bound</l>
     <l n="5">No other tree could live . But gallantly</l>
     <l n="6">The giant wears the scarf , and flowers are hung</l>
     <l n="7">In crimson clusters all the boughs among ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whereon all day are gathered bird and bee ;</l>
     <l n="9">And oft at nights the garden overflows</l>
     <l n="10">With one sweet song that seems to have no close ,</l>
     <l n="11">Sung darkling from our tree , while men repose ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">When first my casement is wide open thrown</l>
     <l n="13">At dawn , my eyes delighted on it rest ;</l>
     <l n="14">Sometimes , and most in winter — on its crest</l>
     <l n="15">A gray baboon sits statue-like alone</l>
     <l n="16">Watching the sunrise ; while on lower boughs</l>
     <l n="17">His puny offspring leap about and play ;</l>
     <l n="18">And far and near kokilas hail the day ;</l>
     <l n="19">And to their pastures wend our sleepy cows ;</l>
     <l n="20">And in the shadow , on the broad tank cast</l>
     <l n="21">By that hoar tree , so beautiful and vast ,</l>
     <l n="22">The water-lilies spring , like snow enmassed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">But not because of its magnificence</l>
     <l n="24">Dear is the Casuarina to my soul :</l>
     <l n="25">Beneath it we have played ; though years may roll ,</l>
     <l n="26">O sweet companions , loved with love intense ,</l>
     <l n="27">For your sakes , shall the tree be ever dear !</l>
     <l n="28">Blent with your images , it shall arise</l>
     <l n="29">In memory , till the hot tears blind mine eyes !</l>
     <l n="30">What is that dirge-like murmur that I hear</l>
     <l n="31">Like the sea breaking on a shingle-beach ?</l>
     <l n="32">It is the tree 's lament , an eerie speech ,</l>
     <l n="33">That haply to the unknown land may reach .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">Unknown , yet well-known to the eye of faith !</l>
     <l n="35">Ah , I have heard that wail far , far away</l>
     <l n="36">In distant lands , by many a sheltered bay ,</l>
     <l n="37">When slumbered in his cave the water-wraith</l>
     <l n="38">And the waves gently kissed the classic shore</l>
     <l n="39">Of France or Italy , beneath the moon ,</l>
     <l n="40">When earth lay tranced in a dreamless swoon :</l>
     <l n="41">And every time the music rose — before</l>
     <l n="42">Mine inner vision rose a form sublime ,</l>
     <l n="43">Thy form , O Tree , as in my happy prime</l>
     <l n="44">I saw thee , in my own loved native clime .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">Therefore I fain would consecrate a lay</l>
     <l n="46">Unto thy honor , Tree , beloved of those</l>
     <l n="47">Who now in blessed sleep , for aye , repose ,</l>
     <l n="48">Dearer than life to me , alas ! were they !</l>
     <l n="49">May'st thou be numbered when my days are done</l>
     <l n="50">With deathless trees — like those in Borrowdale ,</l>
     <l n="51">Under whose awful branches lingered pale</l>
     <l n="52">“ Fear , trembling Hope , and Death , the skeleton ,</l>
     <l n="53">And Time , the shadow ; ” and though weak the verse</l>
     <l n="54">That would thy beauty fain , oh fain rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="55">May Love defend thee from Oblivion 's curse .</l>
