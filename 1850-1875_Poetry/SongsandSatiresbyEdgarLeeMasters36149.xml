      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">I have known the silence of the stars and of the sea ,</l>
       <l n="3">And the silence of the city when it pauses ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the silence of a man and a maid ,</l>
       <l n="5">And the silence for which music alone finds the word ,</l>
       <l n="6">And the silence of the woods before the winds of spring begin ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the silence of the sick</l>
       <l n="8">When their eyes roam about the room .</l>
       <l n="9">And I ask : For the depths</l>
       <l n="10">Of what use is language ?</l>
       <l n="11">A beast of the field moans a few times</l>
       <l n="12">When death takes its young :</l>
       <l n="13">And we are voiceless in the presence of realities —</l>
       <l n="14">We cannot speak .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">A curious boy asks an old soldier</l>
       <l n="16">Sitting in front of the grocery store ,</l>
       <l n="17">“ How did you lose your leg ? ”</l>
       <l n="18">And the old soldier is struck with silence ,</l>
       <l n="19">Or his mind flies away ,</l>
       <l n="20">Because he cannot concentrate it on Gettysburg .</l>
       <l n="21">It comes back jocosely</l>
       <l n="22">And he says , “ A bear bit it off . ”</l>
       <l n="23">And the boy wonders , while the old soldier</l>
       <l n="24">Dumbly , feebly lives over</l>
       <l n="25">The flashes of guns , the thunder of cannon ,</l>
       <l n="26">The shrieks of the slain ,</l>
       <l n="27">And himself lying on the ground ,</l>
       <l n="28">And the hospital surgeons , the knives ,</l>
       <l n="29">And the long days in bed .</l>
       <l n="30">But if he could describe it all</l>
       <l n="31">He would be an artist .</l>
       <l n="32">But if he were an artist there would be deeper wounds</l>
       <l n="33">Which he could not describe .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="34">There is the silence of a great hatred ,</l>
       <l n="35">And the silence of a great love ,</l>
       <l n="36">And the silence of a deep peace of mind ,</l>
       <l n="37">And the silence of an embittered friendship .</l>
       <l n="38">There is the silence of a spiritual crisis ,</l>
       <l n="39">Through which your soul , exquisitely tortured ,</l>
       <l n="40">Comes with visions not to be uttered</l>
       <l n="41">Into a realm of higher life .</l>
       <l n="42">And the silence of the gods who understand each other without speech .</l>
       <l n="43">There is the silence of defeat .</l>
       <l n="44">There is the silence of those unjustly punished ;</l>
       <l n="45">And the silence of the dying whose hand</l>
       <l n="46">Suddenly grips yours .</l>
       <l n="47">There is the silence between father and son ,</l>
       <l n="48">When the father cannot explain his life ,</l>
       <l n="49">Even though he be misunderstood for it .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="50">There is the silence that comes between husband and wife .</l>
       <l n="51">There is the silence of those who have failed ;</l>
       <l n="52">And the vast silence that covers</l>
       <l n="53">Broken nations and vanquished leaders .</l>
       <l n="54">There is the silence of Lincoln ,</l>
       <l n="55">Thinking of the poverty of his youth .</l>
       <l n="56">And the silence of Napoleon</l>
       <l n="57">After Waterloo .</l>
       <l n="58">And the silence of Jeanne d'Arc</l>
       <l n="59">Saying amid the flames , “ Blessed Jesus ” —</l>
       <l n="60">Revealing in two words all sorrow , all hope .</l>
       <l n="61">And there is the silence of age ,</l>
       <l n="62">Too full of wisdom for the tongue to utter it</l>
       <l n="63">In words intelligible to those who have not lived</l>
       <l n="64">The great range of life .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="65">And there is the silence of the dead .</l>
       <l n="66">If we who are in life cannot speak</l>
       <l n="67">Of profound experiences ,</l>
       <l n="68">Why do you marvel that the dead</l>
       <l n="69">Do not tell you of death ?</l>
       <l n="70">Their silence shall be interpreted</l>
       <l n="71">As we approach them .</l>

      <head>ST. FRANCIS AND LADY CLARE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Antonio loved the Lady Clare .</l>
       <l n="2">He caught her to him on the stair</l>
       <l n="3">And pressed her breasts and kissed her hair ,</l>
       <l n="4">And drew her lips in his , and drew</l>
       <l n="5">Her soul out like a torch 's flare .</l>
       <l n="6">Her breath came quick , her blood swirled round ;</l>
       <l n="7">Her senses in a vortex swound .</l>
       <l n="8">She tore him loose and turned around ,</l>
       <l n="9">And reached her chamber in a bound</l>
       <l n="10">Her cheeks turned to a poppy 's hue .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">She closed the door and turned the lock ,</l>
       <l n="12">Her breasts and flesh were turned to rock .</l>
       <l n="13">She reeled as drunken from the shock .</l>
       <l n="14">Before her eyes the devils skipped ,</l>
       <l n="15">She thought she heard the devils mock .</l>
       <l n="16">For had her soul not been as pure</l>
       <l n="17">As sifted snow , could she endure</l>
       <l n="18">Antonio 's passion and be sure</l>
       <l n="19">Against his passion 's strength and lure ?</l>
       <l n="20">Lean fears along her wonder slipped .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="21">Outside she heard a drunkard call ,</l>
       <l n="22">She heard a beggar against the wall</l>
       <l n="23">Shaking his cup , a harlot 's squall</l>
       <l n="24">Struck through the riot like a sword ,</l>
       <l n="25">And gashed the midnight 's festival .</l>
       <l n="26">She watched the city through the pane ,</l>
       <l n="27">The old Silenus half insane ,</l>
       <l n="28">The idiot crowd that drags its chain —</l>
       <l n="29">And then she heard the bells again ,</l>
       <l n="30">And heard the voices with the word :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="31">Ecco il santo ! Up the street</l>
       <l n="32">There was the sound of running feet</l>
       <l n="33">From closing door and window seat ,</l>
       <l n="34">And all the crowd turned on its way</l>
       <l n="35">The Saint of Poverty to greet .</l>
       <l n="36">He passed . And then a circling thrill ,</l>
       <l n="37">As water troubled which was still ,</l>
       <l n="38">Went through her body like a chill ,</l>
       <l n="39">Who of Antonio thought until</l>
       <l n="40">She heard the Saint begin to pray .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="41">And then she turned into the room</l>
       <l n="42">Her soul was cloven through with doom ,</l>
       <l n="43">Treading the softness and the gloom</l>
       <l n="44">Of Asia 's silk and Persia 's wool ,</l>
       <l n="45">And China 's magical perfume .</l>
       <l n="46">She sickened from the vases hued</l>
       <l n="47">In corals , yellows , greens , the lewd</l>
       <l n="48">Twined dragon shapes and figures nude ,</l>
       <l n="49">And tapestries that showed a brood</l>
       <l n="50">Of leopards by a pool !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="51">Candles of wax she lit before</l>
       <l n="52">A pier glass standing from the floor ;</l>
       <l n="53">Up to the ceiling , off she tore</l>
       <l n="54">With eager hands her jewels , then</l>
       <l n="55">The silken vesture which she wore .</l>
       <l n="56">Her little breasts so round to see</l>
       <l n="57">Were budded like the peony .</l>
       <l n="58">Her arms were white as ivory ,</l>
       <l n="59">And all her sunny hair lay free</l>
       <l n="60">As marigold or celandine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="61">Her blue eyes sparkled like a vase</l>
       <l n="62">Of crackled turquoise , in her face</l>
       <l n="63">Was memory of the mad embrace</l>
       <l n="64">Antonio gave her on the stair ,</l>
       <l n="65">And on her cheeks a salt tear 's trace .</l>
       <l n="66">Like pigeon blood her lips were red .</l>
       <l n="67">She clasped her bands above her head .</l>
       <l n="68">Under her arms the waxlight shed</l>
       <l n="69">Delicate halos where was spread</l>
       <l n="70">The downy growth of hair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="71">Such sudden sin the virgin knew</l>
       <l n="72">She quenched the tapers as she blew</l>
       <l n="73">Puff ! puff ! upon them , then she threw</l>
       <l n="74">Herself in tears upon her knees ,</l>
       <l n="75">And round her couch the curtain drew .</l>
       <l n="76">She called upon St. Francis ’ name ,</l>
       <l n="77">Feeling Antonio 's passion maim</l>
       <l n="78">Her body with his passion 's flame</l>
       <l n="79">To save her , save her from the shame</l>
       <l n="80">Of fancies such as these !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="81">“ Go by mad life and old pursuits ,</l>
       <l n="82">The wine cup and the golden fruits ,</l>
       <l n="83">The gilded mirrors , rosewood flutes ,</l>
       <l n="84">I would praise God forevermore</l>
       <l n="85">With harps of gold and silver lutes . ”</l>
       <l n="86">She stripped the velvet from her couch</l>
       <l n="87">Her broken spirit to avouch .</l>
       <l n="88">She saw the devils slink and slouch ,</l>
       <l n="89">And passion like a leopard crouch</l>
       <l n="90">Half mirrored on the polished floor .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="91">Next day she found the saint and said :</l>
       <l n="92">I would be God 's bride , I would wed</l>
       <l n="93">Poverty and I would eat the bread</l>
       <l n="94">That you for anchorites prepare ,</l>
       <l n="95">For my soul 's sake I am in dread .</l>
       <l n="96">Go then , said Francis , nothing loth ,</l>
       <l n="97">Put off this gown of green snake cloth ,</l>
       <l n="98">Put on one somber as a moth ,</l>
       <l n="99">Then come to me and make your troth</l>
       <l n="100">And I will clip your golden hair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="101">She went and came . But still there lay ,</l>
       <l n="102">A gem she did not put away ,</l>
       <l n="103">A locket twixt her breasts , all gay</l>
       <l n="104">In shimmering pearls and tints of blue ,</l>
       <l n="105">And inlay work of fruit and spray .</l>
       <l n="106">St. Francis felt it as he slipped</l>
       <l n="107">His hand across her breast and whipped</l>
       <l n="108">Her golden tresses ere he clipped —</l>
       <l n="109">He closed his eyes then as he gripped</l>
       <l n="110">The shears , plunged the shears through .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="111">The waterfall of living gold .</l>
       <l n="112">The locks fell to the floor and rolled ,</l>
       <l n="113">And curled like serpents which unfold .</l>
       <l n="114">And there sat Lady Clare despoiled .</l>
       <l n="115">Of worldly glory manifold .</l>
       <l n="116">She thrilled to feel him take and hide</l>
       <l n="117">The locket from her breast , a tide</l>
       <l n="118">Of passion caught them side by side .</l>
       <l n="119">He was the bridegroom , she the bride —</l>
       <l n="120">Their flesh but not their spirits foiled .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="121">Thus was the Lady Clare debased</l>
       <l n="122">To sack cloth and around her waist</l>
       <l n="123">A rope the jeweled belt replaced .</l>
       <l n="124">Her feet made free of silken hose</l>
       <l n="125">Naked in wooden sandals cased</l>
       <l n="126">Went bruised to Bastia 's chapel , then</l>
       <l n="127">They housed her in St. Damian</l>
       <l n="128">And here she prayed for poor women</l>
       <l n="129">And here St. Francis sought her when</l>

      <head>THE COCKED HAT</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Would that someone would knock Mr. Bryan into a cocked hat .— WOODROW</l>
       <l n="2">WILSON .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">It ai n't really a hat at all , Ed :</l>
       <l n="4">You know that , do n't you ?</l>
       <l n="5">When you bowl over six out of the nine pins ,</l>
       <l n="6">And the three that are standing</l>
       <l n="7">Are the triangular three in front ,</l>
       <l n="8">You 've knocked the nine into a cocked hat .</l>
       <l n="9">If it was really a hat , he would be knocked in , too .</l>
       <l n="10">Which he hardly is . For a man with money ,</l>
       <l n="11">And a man who can draw a crowd to listen</l>
       <l n="12">To what he says , ai n't all-in yet ....</l>
       <l n="13">Oh yes , defeated</l>
       <l n="14">And killed off a dozen times , but still</l>
       <l n="15">He 's one of the three nine pins that 's standing ...</l>
       <l n="16">Eh ? Why , the other is Teddy , the other</l>
       <l n="17">Wilson , we 'll say . We 'll see , perhaps .</l>
       <l n="18">But six are down to make the cocked hat —</l>
       <l n="19">That 's me and thousands of others like me ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the first-rate men who were cuffed about</l>
       <l n="21">After the Civil War ,</l>
       <l n="22">And most of the more than six million men</l>
       <l n="23">Who followed this fellow into the ditch ,</l>
       <l n="24">While he walked down the ditch and stepped to the level —</l>
       <l n="25">Following an ideal !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="26">Do you remember how slim he was ,</l>
       <l n="27">And trim he was ,</l>
       <l n="28">With black hair and pale brow ,</l>
       <l n="29">And the hawk-like nose and flashing eyes ,</l>
       <l n="30">Not turning slowly like an owl</l>
       <l n="31">But with a sudden eagle motion ?...</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="32">One time , in ‘ 96 , he came here</l>
       <l n="33">And we had just a dollar and sixty cents</l>
       <l n="34">In the treasury of the organization .</l>
       <l n="35">So I stuck his lithograph on a pole</l>
       <l n="36">And started out for the station .</l>
       <l n="37">By the time we got back here to Clark street</l>
       <l n="38">Four thousand men were marching in line ,</l>
       <l n="39">And a band that was playing for an opening</l>
       <l n="40">Of a restaurant on Franklin street</l>
       <l n="41">Had left the job and was following his carriage .</l>
       <l n="42">Why , it took all the money Mark Hanna could raise</l>
       <l n="43">To beat me , with nothing but a pole</l>
       <l n="44">And a lithograph .</l>
       <l n="45">And it was n't because he was one of the prophets</l>
       <l n="46">Come back to earth again .</l>
       <l n="47">It shows how human hearts are hungry</l>
       <l n="48">How wonderfully true they are —</l>
       <l n="49">And how they will rise and follow a man</l>
       <l n="50">Who seems to see the truth !</l>
       <l n="51">Well , these fellows who marched are the cocked hat ,</l>
       <l n="52">And I am the cocked hat and the six millions ,</l>
       <l n="53">And more are the cocked hat ,</l>
       <l n="54">Who got themselves despised or suspected</l>
       <l n="55">Of ignorance or something for being with him .</l>
       <l n="56">But still , he 's one of the pins that 's standing .</l>
       <l n="57">He got the money that he went after ,</l>
       <l n="58">And he has a place in history , perhaps —</l>
       <l n="59">Because we took the blow and fell down</l>
       <l n="60">When the ripping ball went wild on the alley .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="61">For we were radicals ,</l>
       <l n="62">And he was n't a radical .</l>
       <l n="63">Eh ? Why , a radical stands for freedom ,</l>
       <l n="64">And for truth — which he never finds</l>
       <l n="65">But always looks for .</l>
       <l n="66">A radical is not a moralist .</l>
       <l n="67">A radical does n't say :</l>
       <l n="68">“ This is true and you must believe it ;</l>
       <l n="69">This is good and you must accept it ,</l>
       <l n="70">And if you do n't believe it and accept it</l>
       <l n="71">We 'll get a law and make you ,</l>
       <l n="72">And if you do n't obey the law , we 'll kill you — ”</l>
       <l n="73">Oh no ! A radical stands for freedom .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="74">Do you remember that banquet at the Tremont</l>
       <l n="75">In ‘ 97 on Jackson 's day ?</l>
       <l n="76">Bryan and Altgeld walked together</l>
       <l n="77">Out to the banquet room .</l>
       <l n="78">That 's the time he said the bolters must</l>
       <l n="79">Bring fruits meet for repentance — ha ! ha ! Oh , Gawd !—</l>
       <l n="80">They never did it and they did n't have to ,</l>
       <l n="81">For they had made friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ,</l>
       <l n="82">Even as he did , a little later , in his own way .</l>
       <l n="83">Well , Darrow was there that night .</l>
       <l n="84">I thought it was terribly raw in him ,</l>
       <l n="85">But he said to Bryan , there , in a group :</l>
       <l n="86">“ You 'd better go back to Lincoln and study</l>
       <l n="87">Science , history , philosophy ,</l>
       <l n="88">And read Flaubert 's Madam something-or-other ,</l>
       <l n="89">And quit this village religious stuff .</l>
       <l n="90">You 're head of the party before you are ready</l>
       <l n="91">And a leader should lead with thought . ”</l>
       <l n="92">And Bryan turned to the others and said :</l>
       <l n="93">“ Darrow 's the only man in the world</l>
       <l n="94">Who looks down on me for believing in God . ”</l>
       <l n="95">“ Your kind of a God , ” snapped Darrow .</l>
       <l n="96">Honest , Ed , I did n't see this religious business</l>
       <l n="97">In Bryan in ‘ 96 or 1900 .</l>
       <l n="98">Oh well , I knew he went to Church ,</l>
       <l n="99">And talked as statesmen do of God —</l>
       <l n="100">But McKinley did it , and I used to laugh :</l>
       <l n="101">“ We 've got a man to match McKinley ,</l>
       <l n="102">And it 's good for us , in a squeeze like this ,</l>
       <l n="103">We did n't nominate some fellow</l>
       <l n="104">Ethical culture or Unitarian . ”</l>
       <l n="105">You see , the newspapers and preachers then</l>
       <l n="106">Were raising such a hullabaloo</l>
       <l n="107">About irreligion and dishonesty ,</l>
       <l n="108">And calling old Altgeld an anarchist ,</l>
       <l n="109">And comparing us to Robespierre</l>
       <l n="110">And the guillotine boys in France .</l>
       <l n="111">And a little of this religion came in handy .</l>
       <l n="112">The same as if you saw a Mason button on me ,</l>
       <l n="113">You 'd know , you see — but Gee !</l>
       <l n="114">He was 24-carat religious ,</l>
       <l n="115">A cover-to-cover man ....</l>
       <l n="116">He was a trained collie ,</l>
       <l n="117">And he looked like a lion ,</l>
       <l n="118">There in the convention of ‘ 96 — What do you know about that ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="119">But right here , I tell you he ai n't a hypocrite ,</l>
       <l n="120">This ai n't a pose . But I 'll tell you :</l>
       <l n="121">In ‘ 96 when they knocked him out ,</l>
       <l n="122">I know what he said to himself as well</l>
       <l n="123">As if I heard him say it ...</l>
       <l n="124">I 'll tell you in a minute .</l>
       <l n="125">But suppose you were giving a lecture on the constitution ,</l>
       <l n="126">And you got mixed on your dates ,</l>
       <l n="127">And the audience rotten-egged you ,</l>
       <l n="128">And some one in the confusion</l>
       <l n="129">Stole the door receipts ,</l>
       <l n="130">And there you were , disgraced and broke !</l>
       <l n="131">But suppose you could just change your clothes ,</l>
       <l n="132">And lecture to the same audience</l>
       <l n="133">On the religious nature of Washington ,</l>
       <l n="134">And be applauded and make money —</l>
       <l n="135">You 'd do it , would n't you ?</l>
       <l n="136">Well , this is what Bill said to himself :</l>
       <l n="137">“ I 'm naturally regular and religious .</l>
       <l n="138">I 'm a moral man and I can prove it</l>
       <l n="139">By any one in Marion County ,</l>
       <l n="140">Or Jacksonville or Lincoln , Nebraska .</l>
       <l n="141">I 'm a radical , but a radical</l>
       <l n="142">Alone can be religious .</l>
       <l n="143">I belong to the church , if not to the bank ,</l>
       <l n="144">Of the people who defeated me .</l>
       <l n="145">And I 'll prove to religious people</l>
       <l n="146">That I 'm a man to be trusted —</l>
       <l n="147">And just what a radical is .</l>
       <l n="148">And I 'll make some money while winning the votes</l>
       <l n="149">Of the churches over the country . ” ...</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="150">That 's it — it ai n't hypocrisy ,</l>
       <l n="151">It 's using what you are for ends ,</l>
       <l n="152">When you find yourself in trouble .</l>
       <l n="153">And this accounts for “ The Prince of Peace ” —</l>
       <l n="154">Except no one but him could write it —</l>
       <l n="155">And “ The Value of an Ideal ” —</l>

       <l n="157">His place in history ?</l>
       <l n="158">One time my grandfather , who was nearly blind ,</l>
       <l n="159">Went out to sow some grass seed .</l>
       <l n="160">They had two sacks in the barn ,</l>
       <l n="161">One with grass seed , one with fertilizer ,</l>
       <l n="162">And he got the sack with fertilizer ,</l>
       <l n="163">And scattered it over the ground ,</l>
       <l n="164">Thinking he was sowing grass .</l>
       <l n="165">And as he was finishing up , a grandchild ,</l>
       <l n="166">Dorothy , eight years old ,</l>
       <l n="167">Followed him , dropping flower seeds .</l>
       <l n="168">Well , after a time</l>
       <l n="169">That was the greatest patch of weeds</l>
       <l n="170">You ever saw ! And the old man sat ,</l>
       <l n="171">Half blind , on the porch , and said :</l>
       <l n="172">“ Good land , that grass is growing ! ”</l>
       <l n="173">And there was nothing but weeds except</l>
       <l n="174">A few nasturtiums here and there</l>
       <l n="175">That Dorothy had sown ....</l>
       <l n="176">Well , I forgot .</l>
       <l n="177">There was a sunflower in one corner</l>
       <l n="178">That looked like a man with a golden beard</l>

      <head>THE VISION</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Of that dear vale where you and I have lain</l>
       <l n="2">Scanning the mysteries of life and death</l>
       <l n="3">I dreamed , though how impassable the space</l>
       <l n="4">Of time between the present and the past !</l>
       <l n="5">This was the vision that possessed my mind ;</l>
       <l n="6">I thought the weird and gusty days of March</l>
       <l n="7">Had eased themselves in melody and peace .</l>
       <l n="8">Pale lights , swift shadows , lucent stalks , clear streams ,</l>
       <l n="9">Cool , rosy eves behind the penciled mesh</l>
       <l n="10">Of hazel thickets , and the huge feathered boughs</l>
       <l n="11">Of walnut trees stretched singing to the blast ;</l>
       <l n="12">And the first pleasantries of sheep and kine ;</l>
       <l n="13">The cautioned twitterings of hidden birds ;</l>
       <l n="14">The flight of geese among the scattered clouds ;</l>
       <l n="15">Night 's weeping stars and all the pageantries</l>
       <l n="16">Of awakened life had blossomed into May ,</l>
       <l n="17">Whilst she with trailing violets in her hair</l>
       <l n="18">Blew music from the stops of watery stems ,</l>
       <l n="19">And swept the grasses with her viewless robes ,</l>
       <l n="20">Which dreaming men thought voices , dreaming still .</l>
       <l n="21">Now as I lay in vision by the stream</l>
       <l n="22">That flows amidst our well beloved vale ,</l>
       <l n="23">I looked throughout the vista stretched between</l>
       <l n="24">Two ranging hills ; one meadowed rich in grass ;</l>
       <l n="25">The other wooded , thick and quite obscure</l>
       <l n="26">With overgrowth , rank in the luxury</l>
       <l n="27">Of all wild places , but ever growing sparse</l>
       <l n="28">Of trees or saplings on the sudden slope</l>
       <l n="29">That met the grassy level of the vale ;—</l>
       <l n="30">But still within the shadow of those woods ,</l>
       <l n="31">Which sprinkled all beneath with fragrant dew ,</l>
       <l n="32">There grew all flowers , which tempted little paths</l>
       <l n="33">Between them , up and on into the wood .</l>
       <l n="34">Here , as the sun had left his midday peak</l>
       <l n="35">The incommunicable blue of heaven blent</l>
       <l n="36">With his fierce splendor , filling all the air</l>
       <l n="37">With softened glory , while the pasturage</l>
       <l n="38">Trembled with color of the poppy blooms</l>
       <l n="39">Shook by the steps of the swift-sandaled wind .</l>
       <l n="40">Nor any sound beside disturbed the dream</l>
       <l n="41">Of Silence slumbering on the drowsy flowers .</l>
       <l n="42">Then as I looked upon the widest space</l>
       <l n="43">Of open meadow where the sunlight fell</l>
       <l n="44">In veils of tempered radiance , I saw</l>
       <l n="45">The form of one who had escaped the care</l>
       <l n="46">And equal dullness of our common day .</l>
       <l n="47">For like a bright mist rising from the earth</l>
       <l n="48">He made appearance , growing more distinct</l>
       <l n="49">Until I saw the stole , likewise the lyre</l>
       <l n="50">Grasped by the fingers of the modeled hand .</l>
       <l n="51">Yea , I did see the glory of his hair</l>
       <l n="52">Against the deep green bay-leaves filleting</l>
       <l n="53">The ungathered locks . And so throughout the vale</l>
       <l n="54">His figure stood distinct and his own shade</l>
       <l n="55">Was the sole shadow . Deeming this approach</l>
       <l n="56">Augur of good , as if in hidden ways</l>
       <l n="57">Of loveliness the gods do still appear</l>
       <l n="58">The counselors of men , and even where</l>
       <l n="59">Wonder and meditation wooed us oft ,</l>
       <l n="60">I cried , “ Apollo ” — and his form dissolved ,</l>
       <l n="61">As if the nymphs of echo , who took up</l>
       <l n="62">The voice and bore it to the hollow wood ,</l>
       <l n="63">By that same flight had startled the great god</l>
       <l n="64">To vanishment . And thereupon I woke</l>
       <l n="65">And disarrayed the figment of my thought .</l>
       <l n="66">For of the very air , magic with hues ,</l>
       <l n="67">Blent with the distant objects , I had formed</l>
       <l n="68">The splendid apparition , and so knew</l>
       <l n="69">It was , alas ! a dream within a dream !</l>

       <l n="113">As a boy can be I was critical of you .</l>

       <l n="121">While I knew it not at all in truth .</l>
       <l n="122">And an adolescent egotism</l>
       <l n="123">Made me feel you did not know me</l>

       <l n="310">And keen in spite of the open air .</l>
       <l n="311">And just as I entered the brilliant car</l>
       <l n="312">Something said to me you are dead —</l>

       <l n="172">Coarsely against the world 's great store of wealth ;</l>

       <l n="1">His father had a large family</l>
       <l n="2">Of girls and boys and he was born and bred</l>
       <l n="3">In a barn or kind of cattle shed .</l>
       <l n="4">But he was a hardy youngster and grew to be</l>
       <l n="5">A boy with eyes that sparkled like a rod</l>
       <l n="6">Of white hot iron in the blacksmith shop .</l>
       <l n="7">His face was ruddy like a rising moon ,</l>
       <l n="8">And his hair was black as sheep 's wool that is black .</l>
       <l n="9">And he had rugged arms and legs and a strong back .</l>
       <l n="10">And he had a voice half flute and half bassoon .</l>
       <l n="11">And from his toes up to his head 's top</l>
       <l n="12">He was a man , simple but intricate .</l>
       <l n="13">And most men differ who try to delineate</l>
       <l n="14">His life and fate .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">He never seemed ashamed</l>
       <l n="16">Of poverty or of his origin . He was a wayward child ,</l>
       <l n="17">Nevertheless though wise and mild ,</l>
       <l n="18">And thoughtful but when angered then he flamed</l>
       <l n="19">As fire does in a forge .</l>
       <l n="20">When he was ten years old he ran away</l>
       <l n="21">To be alone and watch the sea , and the stars</l>
       <l n="22">At midnight from a mountain gorge .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="23">When he returned his parents scolded him</l>
       <l n="24">And threatened him with bolts and bars .</l>
       <l n="25">Then they grew soft for his return and gay</l>
       <l n="26">And with their love would have enfolded him .</l>
       <l n="27">But even at ten years old he had a way</l>
       <l n="28">Of gazing at you with a look austere</l>
       <l n="29">Which gave his kinfolk fear .</l>
       <l n="30">He had no childlike love for father or mother ,</l>
       <l n="31">Sister or brother ,</l>
       <l n="32">They were the same to him as any other .</l>
       <l n="33">He was a little cold , a little queer .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="34">His father was a laborer and now</l>
       <l n="35">They made the boy work for his daily bread .</l>
       <l n="36">They say he read</l>
       <l n="37">A book or two during these years of work .</l>
       <l n="38">But if there was a secret prone to lurk</l>
       <l n="39">Between the pages under the light of his brow</l>
       <l n="40">It came forth . And if he had a woman</l>
       <l n="41">In love or out of love , or a companion or a chum ,</l>
       <l n="42">History is dumb .</l>
       <l n="43">So far as we know he dreamed and worked with hands</l>
       <l n="44">And learned to know his genius ’ commands</l>
       <l n="45">Or what is called one 's daemon .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="46">And this became at last the city 's call .</l>
       <l n="47">He had now reached the age of thirty years ,</l>
       <l n="48">And found a Dream of Life and a solution</l>
       <l n="49">For slavery of soul and even all</l>
       <l n="50">Miseries that flow from things material .</l>
       <l n="51">To free the world was his soul 's resolution .</l>
       <l n="52">But his family had great fears</l>
       <l n="53">For him , knowing the evil</l>
       <l n="54">Which might befall him , seeing that the light</l>
       <l n="55">Of his own dream had blinded his mind 's eyes .</l>
       <l n="56">They could not tell but what he had a devil .</l>
       <l n="57">But still in their tears despite ,</l>
       <l n="58">And warnings he departed with replies</l>
       <l n="59">That when a man 's genius calls him</l>
       <l n="60">He must obey no matter what befalls him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="61">What he had in his mind was growth</l>
       <l n="62">Of soul by watching ,</l>
       <l n="63">And the creation of eyes</l>
       <l n="64">Over your mind 's eyes to supervise</l>
       <l n="65">A clear activity and to ward off sloth .</l>
       <l n="66">What he had in his mind was scotching</l>
       <l n="67">And killing the snake of Hatred and stripping the glove</l>
       <l n="68">From the hand of Hypocrisy and quenching the fire</l>
       <l n="69">Of Falsehood and Unbrotherly Desire .—</l>
       <l n="70">What he had in his mind was simply Love .</l>
       <l n="71">And it was strange he preached the sword and force</l>
       <l n="72">To establish Love , but it was not strange ,</l>
       <l n="73">Since he did this , his life took on a change .</l>
       <l n="74">And what he taught seems muddled at its source</l>
       <l n="75">With moralizing and with moral strife .</l>
       <l n="76">For morals are merely the Truth diluted</l>
       <l n="77">And sweetened up and suited</l>
       <l n="78">To the business and bread of Life .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="79">And now this City was just what you 'd find</l>
       <l n="80">A city anywhere ,</l>
       <l n="81">A turmoil and a Vanity Fair ,</l>
       <l n="82">A sort of heaven and a sort of Tophet .</l>
       <l n="83">There were so many leaders of his kind</l>
       <l n="84">The city did n't care</l>
       <l n="85">For one additional prophet .</l>
       <l n="86">He said some extravagant things</l>
       <l n="87">And planted a few stings</l>
       <l n="88">Under the rich man 's hide .</l>
       <l n="89">And one of the sensational newspapers</l>
       <l n="90">Gave him a line or two for cutting capers</l>
       <l n="91">In front of the Palace of Justice and the Church .</l>
       <l n="92">But all of the first grade people took the other side</l>
       <l n="93">Of the street when they saw him coming</l>
       <l n="94">With a rag tag crowd singing and humming ,</l>
       <l n="95">And curious boys and men up in a perch</l>
       <l n="96">Of a tree or window taking the spectacle in ,</l>
       <l n="97">And the Corybantic din</l>
       <l n="98">Of a Salvation Army as it were .</l>
       <l n="99">And whatever he dreamed when he lived in a little town</l>
       <l n="100">The intelligent people ignored him , and this is the stir</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="102">But there was a certain sinister</l>
       <l n="103">Fellow who came to him hearing of his renown</l>
       <l n="104">And said “ You can be Mayor of this city ,</l>
       <l n="105">We need a man like you for Mayor . ”</l>
       <l n="106">And others said “ You 'd make a lawyer or a politician ,</l>
       <l n="107">Look how the people follow you ;</l>
       <l n="108">Why do n't you hire out as a special writer ,</l>
       <l n="109">You could become a business man , a rhetorician ,</l>
       <l n="110">You could become a player ,</l>
       <l n="111">You can grow rich . There 's nothing for a fighter ,</l>
       <l n="112">Fighting as you are , but to end in ruin . ”</l>
       <l n="113">But he turned from them on his way pursuing</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="115">He had a rich man or two</l>

       <l n="118">For you 'll always find a rich man or two</l>
       <l n="119">To take up with anything .</l>
       <l n="120">There are those who can n't get into society or bring</l>
       <l n="121">Their riches to a social recognition ;</l>

       <l n="123">Spirit for life .</l>
       <l n="124">But as for him he did n't care , he passed</l>
       <l n="125">Where the richness of living was rife .</l>

       <l n="129">He walked about the country and the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="130">Took trips upon the lakes and waded fords</l>
       <l n="131">Barefooted , laughing as a young animal</l>
       <l n="132">Disports itself amid the festival</l>
       <l n="133">Of warm winds , sunshine , summer 's carnival —</l>

       <l n="7">He would have dreamed the dream again</l>

       <l n="25">Far off in the waste empyrean</l>

       <l n="34">Under the golden light aslant .</l>
       <l n="35">The little waves patted the shore again</l>

       <l n="43">When the city 's seat was a waste of sand ,</l>

       <l n="46">And the moon rose up like a great white bird ,</l>

       <l n="55">Like a lighthouse which revolves and looks</l>
       <l n="56">Over the land and out to sea :</l>

       <l n="58">Sitting like Buddha spiritually cool ,</l>
       <l n="59">Young as the light of the sun is young ,</l>
       <l n="60">And taking the even with the odd</l>
       <l n="61">As a matter of course , and the path he 's trod</l>
       <l n="62">As a path that was good enough .</l>
       <l n="63">With a sort of transcendental sense</l>
       <l n="64">Whose hatred is less than indifference ,</l>
       <l n="65">And a gift of wisdom in love .</l>
       <l n="66">And who can say as he classifies</l>
       <l n="67">Men and ages with his eyes</l>
       <l n="68">With cool detachment : this is dung ,</l>
       <l n="69">And that poor fellow is just a fool .</l>
       <l n="70">And say what you will death is a rod .</l>
       <l n="71">But I see a light that shines and shines</l>
       <l n="72">And I rather think it 's God .</l>

       <l n="1">The pathos in your face is like a peace ,</l>
       <l n="2">It is like resignation or a grace</l>
       <l n="3">Which smiles at the surcease</l>
       <l n="4">Of hope . But there is in your face</l>
       <l n="5">The shadow of pain , and there is a trace</l>
       <l n="6">Of memory of pain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">I look at you again and again ,</l>
       <l n="8">And hide my looks lest your quick eye perceives</l>
       <l n="9">My search for your despair .</l>
       <l n="10">I look at your pale hands — I look at your hair ;</l>
       <l n="11">And I watch you use your hands , I watch the flare</l>
       <l n="12">Of thought in your eyes like light that interweaves</l>
       <l n="13">A flutter of color running under leaves —</l>
       <l n="14">Such anguished dreams in your eyes !</l>
       <l n="15">And I listen to you speak</l>
       <l n="16">Words like crystals breaking with a tinkle ,</l>
       <l n="17">Or a star 's twinkle .</l>
       <l n="18">Sometimes as we talk you rise</l>
       <l n="19">And leave the room , and then I rub a streak</l>
       <l n="20">Of a tear from my cheek .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="21">You tell me such magical things</l>

       <l n="23">And of your life in France</l>
       <l n="24">In the varied music of exquisite words ,</l>
       <l n="25">And in a voice that sings .</l>
      </lg>

       <l n="26">All things are memory now with you ,</l>
       <l n="27">For poverty girds</l>

       <l n="29">And sometimes here and there</l>
       <l n="30">I see as you turn your head a whitened hair ,</l>
       <l n="31">Even when you are smiling most .</l>
       <l n="32">And a light comes in your eyes like a passing ghost ,</l>

       <l n="34">As burns in a girl 's flesh .</l>
       <l n="35">Then I can shut my eyes and feel the pain</l>
       <l n="36">That has become a part of you , though I feign</l>
       <l n="37">Laughter myself . One sees another 's bruise</l>
       <l n="38">And shakes his thought out of it shuddering .</l>
       <l n="39">So I turn and clamp my will lest I bring</l>

       <l n="43">Then as I think you over after</l>

       <l n="45">Comes to me with its grace</l>
       <l n="46">Of memory of unfound love :</l>
       <l n="47">You seem to me the image of all women</l>
       <l n="48">Who dream and keep under smiles the grief thereof ,</l>
       <l n="49">Or sew , or sit by windows , or read books</l>
       <l n="50">To hide their Secret 's looks .</l>
       <l n="51">And after a time go out of life and leave</l>
       <l n="52">No uttered words but in their silence grieve</l>
       <l n="53">For Life and for the things no tongue can tell :</l>
       <l n="54">Why Life hurts so , and why Love haunts and hurts</l>
       <l n="55">Poor men and women in this demi-hell .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="56">Perhaps your pathos means that it is well</l>
       <l n="57">Death in his time the aspiring torch inverts ,</l>

       <l n="5">But yet the half-drawn shades of bottle green</l>

       <l n="7">With misty auras drawn around their gloom</l>
       <l n="8">Where things lie undistinguished , scarcely seen .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">You , standing between the window and the bed</l>

       <l n="11">Drowsy with quizzical half-open eye</l>
       <l n="12">Musing upon the contour of your head ,</l>
       <l n="13">Watching you comb your hair ,</l>
       <l n="14">Clothed in a corset waist and skirt of silk ,</l>
       <l n="15">Tied with white braid above your slender hips</l>
       <l n="16">Which reaches to your knees and makes your bare</l>
       <l n="17">And delicate legs by contrast white as milk .</l>
       <l n="18">And as you toss your head to comb its tresses</l>
       <l n="19">They flash upon me like long strips of sand</l>
       <l n="20">Between a moonlit sea , pale as your hand ,</l>

       <l n="29">The comb through stubborn tangles , only rise</l>
       <l n="30">Scarcely perceptible with breath or signs ,</l>
       <l n="31">Firm unmaternal like a young Bacchante 's ,</l>

       <l n="34">Now you seem fully under my heart 's sway .</l>

       <l n="43">Where you keep independent life meanwhile .</l>
       <l n="44">How do you live without me , is the fear ?</l>
       <l n="45">You do not lean upon me , ask my love , or wonder</l>
       <l n="46">Of other loves I may have hidden under</l>
       <l n="47">These casual renewals of our love .</l>
       <l n="48">And if I loved you I should lie in flame ,</l>

       <l n="70">Of woman 's tragedy in woman 's fall ;</l>

       <l n="82">And now of Life . For dancing you have cast</l>
       <l n="83">Veil after veil of ideals or pretense</l>
       <l n="84">With which men clothe the being feminine</l>
       <l n="85">To satisfy their lordship or their sense</l>

       <l n="90">The poems and the tales of woman 's fall ....</l>
       <l n="91">You nod your head , you smile , I feel the air</l>

       <l n="93">At the closed door . One , two , your tufted steps</l>
       <l n="94">Die on the velvet of the outer hall .</l>
       <l n="95">You have escaped . And I would not pursue .</l>

       <l n="157">Take me as mistress or wife , it is yours to decide .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Last night a friend of mine and I sat talking ,</l>
       <l n="2">When all at once I found ‘ twas one o'clock .</l>
       <l n="3">So we came out and he went home to wife</l>
       <l n="4">And children , and I started for the club</l>
       <l n="5">Which I call home ; and then just like a flash</l>
       <l n="6">You came into my mind . I bought a slug</l>
       <l n="7">And stood , in the booth , with doubtful heart and heard</l>
       <l n="8">The buzzer buzz . Well , it was sweet to me</l>
       <l n="9">To hear your voice at last — it was so drowsy ,</l>
       <l n="10">Like a child 's voice . And I could see your eyes</l>
       <l n="11">Heavy with sleep , and I could see you standing</l>
       <l n="12">In nightgown with head leaned against the wall ....</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="13">Julia ! the welcome of your drowsy voice</l>
       <l n="14">Went through me like the warmth of priceless wine —</l>
       <l n="15">It showed your understanding , that you know</l>
       <l n="16">How it is with a man , and how it is with me</l>
       <l n="17">Who work by day and sometimes drift by night</l>
       <l n="18">About this hellish city . Though you know</l>
       <l n="19">That I am fifty-one , can you imagine</l>
       <l n="20">My feeling with no children growing up ?</l>
       <l n="21">My feeling as of one who sees a play</l>
       <l n="22">And afterwards sits somewhere at a table</l>
       <l n="23">And talks with friends about the different parts</l>
       <l n="24">Over a sandwich and a glass of beer ?</l>
       <l n="25">My feeling with this money which I 've made</l>
       <l n="26">And cannot use ? Sometimes the stress of working</l>
       <l n="27">The money dulls the fancy which could use it</l>
       <l n="28">In splendid dreams or in the art of life .</l>
       <l n="29">Well , here was I ringing your bell at last</l>
       <l n="30">At half-past one , and there you stood before me</l>
       <l n="31">With a sleepy voice and a sleepy smile , with hands</l>
       <l n="32">So warm , and cheeks so red from sleep , not vexed ,</l>
       <l n="33">But like a child , awakened , who smiles at you</l>
       <l n="34">With half-shut eyes and kisses you , so you</l>
       <l n="35">Gave me a kiss . The world seems better , Julia ,</l>
       <l n="36">For that kiss which you gave me at the door ....</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="37">Breakfast ? Why , toast and coffee , not too strong ,</l>
       <l n="38">My heart acts queer of late ....</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="39">I want to say</l>
       <l n="40">Lest I forget it , if you ever hear</l>
       <l n="41">From Arabel or Francis what I said</l>
       <l n="42">To Francis when he told me he intended</l>
       <l n="43">To marry Arabel , why just remember</l>
       <l n="44">Our talk this morning and forget I said it —</l>
       <l n="45">I 'm sorry that I said it . But , you see ,</l>
       <l n="46">That night we met , I being fifty-one</l>
       <l n="47">And old at what men call the game , looked on</l>
       <l n="48">With steady eye and quiet nerve , I saw you</l>
       <l n="49">Just as I 'd see a woman anywhere ;</l>
       <l n="50">And I found you as I 'd found others before you ,</l>
       <l n="51">But with this difference so it seemed to me :</l>
       <l n="52">What had been false with them was real with you ,</l>
       <l n="53">What had been shame with them with you was life ,</l>
       <l n="54">What had been craft with them with you was nature ,</l>
       <l n="55">What had been sin with them to you was good ,</l>
       <l n="56">What had been vice with them to you the honest</l>
       <l n="57">And uncorrupted innocence of a human</l>
       <l n="58">Heart so human looking on our souls .</l>
       <l n="59">What had been coarse to them to you was clean</l>
       <l n="60">As rain is , or fresh flowers , all things that grow</l>
       <l n="61">And move and sing along creation 's way .</l>
       <l n="62">You came to me like friendship , what you gave</l>
       <l n="63">Was friendship 's gift , when friends think least of self</l>
       <l n="64">And least of motive . And it is through you</l>
       <l n="65">That I have risen out of the pit where sneers</l>
       <l n="66">And laughter , looks and words obscene ,</l>
       <l n="67">Blaspheme our nature . It is through you , Julia ,</l>
       <l n="68">As one amid great beach trees where soft mosses</l>
       <l n="69">Pillow our heads and where we see the clouds</l>
       <l n="70">Upon their infinite sailings and the lake</l>
       <l n="71">Washes beneath us , and we lie and think</l>
       <l n="72">How this has been forever and will be</l>
       <l n="73">When we are dust a thousand , thousand years ,</l>
       <l n="74">Yet how life is eternal — just as one</l>
       <l n="75">Who there falls into prayer for ecstasy</l>
       <l n="76">Of wonder , prophecy could not blaspheme</l>
       <l n="77">The Eternal Power ( as he might well blaspheme</l>
       <l n="78">The gospel hymns and ritual ) that I</l>
       <l n="79">Cannot blaspheme you , Julia .</l>
       <l n="80">For what is our communion , yours and mine ,</l>
       <l n="81">If it be not a way of laying hold</l>
       <l n="82">On that mysterious essence which makes one</l>
       <l n="83">Of heaven and earth , makes kindred human hands ....</l>
       <l n="84">Tears are not like you , Julia ; laugh , that 's right !</l>
       <l n="85">Pour me a little coffee , if you please .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="86">I 'll take from my herbarium certain species</l>
       <l n="87">To make my points : Now here there is the woman</l>
       <l n="88">Of life promiscuous , or nearly so .</l>
       <l n="89">She fixes her design upon a man ,</l>
       <l n="90">Who 's married and the riotous game begins .</l>
       <l n="91">They go along a year or two perhaps .</l>
       <l n="92">Then psychic chemistry performs its part :</l>
       <l n="93">They are in love , or he 's in love with her .</l>
       <l n="94">What shall be done with love ? Now watch the woman :</l>
       <l n="95">That which she gave without love at the first</l>
       <l n="96">She now withdraws in spite of love unless</l>
       <l n="97">He breaks his life up , cuts all former ties</l>
       <l n="98">And weds her . Do you wonder sometimes men</l>
       <l n="99">Kill women with a knife or strangle them ?</l>
       <l n="100">Well , here 's another : She has been to Ogontz ,</l>
       <l n="101">You meet her at a dinner-dance , we 'll say .</l>
       <l n="102">She has green eyes and hair as light as jonquils ;</l>
       <l n="103">She wears black velvet and a salmon sash .</l>
       <l n="104">And when you dance with her she has a way</l>
       <l n="105">Of giving you her flesh beneath thin silk ,</l>
       <l n="106">Which almost lisps as she caresses you</l>
       <l n="107">With legs that scarcely touch you ; and she says</l>
       <l n="108">Things with a double meaning , and she smiles</l>
       <l n="109">To carry out her meaning . Well , you think</l>
       <l n="110">The girl is yours , and after weeks of chasing</l>
       <l n="111">She lands you up at the appointed place</l>
       <l n="112">With mamma , who looks at you with big eyes ,</l>
       <l n="113">That have a nervous way of opening</l>
       <l n="114">And closing slowly like a big wax doll 's ,</l>
       <l n="115">From which great clouds of wrath and wonder come ;</l>
       <l n="116">Which meeting is a way of saying to you :</l>
       <l n="117">The girl is yours if you will marry her ,</l>
       <l n="118">And let her have your money .</l>

       <l n="121">I know that men are easy , but to see</l>
       <l n="122">Women as women see them is a gift</l>
       <l n="123">That comes to men who reach my age in life ....</l>

       <l n="124">Well , here 's another , here 's the type of woman</l>
       <l n="125">Whose power of motherhood conceals the art</l>
       <l n="126">By which she thrives , through which she reaches also</l>
       <l n="127">An apotheosis in society .</l>
       <l n="128">Her dream is children conscious or unconscious .</l>
       <l n="129">And her strength is the race 's , and she draws</l>
       <l n="130">The urgings of posterity and leans</l>
       <l n="131">Upon the hopes and ideals of the day .</l>
       <l n="132">To her a man must sacrifice his life .</l>
       <l n="133">But women , Julia , of whatever type ,</l>
       <l n="134">Are still but waiting ovules seeking man ,</l>
       <l n="135">And man 's life to develop , even to live .</l>
       <l n="136">And like the praying mantis who 's devoured</l>
       <l n="137">In the embrace , man is devoured by women</l>
       <l n="138">In some way , by some sort . Love is a flame</l>
       <l n="139">In man 's life where he warms him but to suck</l>
       <l n="140">The invisible heat and perish . Life is cramped ,</l>
       <l n="141">Bound down with many ropes , shut in by gates —</l>
       <l n="142">Love is not free which should be wholly free</l>
       <l n="143">For Life 's sake .</l>

      <head>THE SORROW OF DEAD FACES</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I have seen many faces changed by the Sculptor Death —</l>
       <l n="2">But never a face like Harold 's who passed in a throe of pain .</l>
       <l n="3">There were maidens and youths in the bud , and men in the lust of life ;</l>
       <l n="4">And women whom child-birth racked till the crying soul slipped through ;</l>
       <l n="5">Patriarchs withered with age and nuns ascetical white ;</l>
       <l n="6">And one who wasted her virgin wealth in a riot of joy .</l>
       <l n="7">Brothers and sisters at last in a quiet and purple pall ,</l>
       <l n="8">Fellow voyagers bound to a port on an ash-blue sea ,</l>
       <l n="9">Locked in an utterless grief , in a mystery fearful to dream .</l>
       <l n="10">All of these I have seen — but the face of Harold the bold</l>
       <l n="11">Looked with a penitent pallor and stared with a sad surprise .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="12">For now at last he was still who never knew rest in life .</l>
       <l n="13">And the ardent heat of his blood was cold as the sweat of a stone .</l>
       <l n="14">Life came in an evil hour and stabbed with a poisoned word</l>
       <l n="15">The heart of a girl who faintly smiled through her tears .</l>
       <l n="16">And her little life was tossed as the eddies that whirl in the hollows</l>
       <l n="17">From the great world-currents that wreck the battle ships at sea .</l>
       <l n="18">And the face of dead Lillian seemed like a rain-ruined flower .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="19">Or what is writ on the brow of the babe as the mother wails for the day</l>
       <l n="20">When it leaped in the light of the sun and babbled its pure delight ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="21">But the face of William the Great was fashioned by life and thought ;</l>
       <l n="22">And death made it massive as bronze , and deepened the lines thereof :</l>
       <l n="23">Some for the will and some for patience , and some for hope —</l>
       <l n="24">Hope for the weal of the world wherein he mightily strove —</l>
       <l n="25">Yet what did it all bespeak — what but submission and awe ,</l>
       <l n="26">And a trace of pain as one with a sword in his side ?</l>

       <l n="2">You knew then , starting let us say with ether ,</l>
       <l n="3">You would become electrons , out of whirling</l>
       <l n="4">Would rise to atoms ; then as an atom resting</l>
       <l n="5">Till through Yourself in other atoms moving</l>
       <l n="6">And by the fine affinity of power</l>
       <l n="7">Atom with atom massed , You would go on</l>
       <l n="8">Over the crest of visible forms transformed ,</l>
       <l n="9">Would be a molecule , a little system</l>
       <l n="10">Wherein the atoms move like suns and planets</l>

       <l n="27">Beneath our feet things hidden from the eye</l>
       <l n="28">However aided ,— as above our heads</l>
       <l n="29">Beyond the Milky Way great systems whirl</l>

       <l n="51">And rises o'er the crest of visible things</l>
       <l n="52">To something else — that man must pass as well</l>

       <l n="59">Ere the green cell rose , even in the green cell</l>
       <l n="60">You saw the sequences of thought — You saw</l>
       <l n="61">That one would say , “ All 's matter ” and another ,</l>
       <l n="62">“ All 's mind , ” and man 's mind which reflects the image ,</l>

       <l n="64">Of what you are would be confused by cries</l>

       <l n="66">Which sees itself beginning in the seeds ,</l>
       <l n="67">Which fly and seek each other , maims</l>
       <l n="68">The soul at the last in loss of child or friend</l>
       <l n="69">Father or mother . And You knew that sex ,</l>
       <l n="70">Ranging from plants through beasts and up to us</l>
       <l n="71">Had ties of filth — And out of them would rise</l>
       <l n="72">Diverse philosophies to tear the world .</l>
       <l n="73">You knew , when the green cell arose , that even</l>
       <l n="74">The You which formed it moving on would bring</l>
       <l n="75">Races and breeds , madmen , tyrants , slaves ,</l>
       <l n="76">The idiot child , the murderer , the insane —</l>
       <l n="77">All springing from the action of one law .</l>
       <l n="78">You knew the enmity that lies between</l>
       <l n="79">The lives of micro-beings and our own . You knew</l>
       <l n="80">How man would rise to vision of himself :</l>
       <l n="81">Immortal only in the race 's life .</l>
       <l n="82">And past the atom and the first glint of life ,</l>
       <l n="83">Saw him with soul enraptured , yet o'ershadowed</l>

       <l n="99">When the lake ripples and the skies are blue</l>
       <l n="100">As larkspur ? Therefore I , who moved in darkness</l>

       <l n="104">And if beyond this stable state that stands</l>
       <l n="105">For your life here ( as cells are whole and balanced</l>
       <l n="106">Till the inner urge bring union , then a breaking</l>
       <l n="107">And building up to higher life ) , there is</l>
       <l n="108">No memory of this world nor of your thought ,</l>
       <l n="109">Nor sense of life on this world lived and borne ;</l>
       <l n="110">Or whether you remember , know yourself</l>
       <l n="111">As one who lived here , suffered here , aspired —</l>
       <l n="112">What does it matter ?— you cannot be lost ,</l>
       <l n="113">As I am lost not . Therefore be at peace .</l>
       <l n="114">And from the laws whose orbits cross and run</l>
       <l n="115">To seeming tangles , find the law through which</l>
       <l n="116">Your soul shall be perfected till it draw ,—</l>
       <l n="117">As the green cell the sunlight draws and turns</l>
       <l n="118">Its chemical effulgence into life —</l>
       <l n="119">My inner splendor . All the rest is mine</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">You wrote :</l>
       <l n="2">“ Come over to Saugatuck</l>
       <l n="3">And be with me on the warm sand ,</l>
       <l n="4">And under cool beeches and aromatic cedars . ”</l>
       <l n="5">And just then no one could do a thing in the city</l>
       <l n="6">For the lure of far places , and something that tugged</l>
       <l n="7">At one 's heart because of a June sky ,</l>
       <l n="8">And stretches of blue water ,</l>
       <l n="9">And a warm wind blowing from the south .</l>
       <l n="10">What could I do but take a boat</l>
       <l n="11">And go to meet you ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="12">And when to-day is not enough ,</l>
       <l n="13">But you must live to-morrow also ;</l>
       <l n="14">And when the present stands in the way</l>
       <l n="15">Of something to come ,</l>
       <l n="16">And there is but one you would see ,</l>
       <l n="17">All the interval of waiting is a wall .</l>
       <l n="18">And so it was I walked the landward deck</l>
       <l n="19">With flapping coat and hat pulled down ;</l>
       <l n="20">And I sat on the leeward deck and looked</l>
       <l n="21">At the streaming smoke of the funnels ,</l>
       <l n="22">And the far waste of rhythmical water ,</l>
       <l n="23">And at the gulls flying by our side .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="24">There was music on board and dancing ,</l>
       <l n="25">But I could not take part .</l>
       <l n="26">For above all there was the bluest sky ,</l>
       <l n="27">And around us the urge of magical distances .</l>
       <l n="28">And just because you were in the violins ,</l>
       <l n="29">And in everything , and were wholly the world</l>
       <l n="30">Of sense and sight ,</l>
       <l n="31">It was too much . One could not live it</l>
       <l n="32">And make it all his own —</l>
       <l n="33">It was too much .</l>
       <l n="34">And I wondered where the rest could be going ,</l>
       <l n="35">Or what they thought of water and sky</l>
       <l n="36">Without knowing you .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="37">But at four o'clock there was a rim ,</l>
       <l n="38">A circled edge of rainbow color</l>
       <l n="39">Which suspired , widened and narrowed under your gaze :</l>
       <l n="40">It was the phantasy of straining eyes ,</l>
       <l n="41">Or land — and it was land .</l>
       <l n="42">It was distant trees .</l>
       <l n="43">And then it was dunes , bluffs of yellow sand .</l>
       <l n="44">We began to wonder how far it was —</l>
       <l n="45">Five miles , or ten miles —</l>
       <l n="46">Surely only five miles !—</l>
       <l n="47">But at last whatever it was we swung to the end .</l>
       <l n="48">We rounded the lighthouse pier ,</l>
       <l n="49">Almost before we knew .</l>
       <l n="50">We slowed our speed in a dizzy river of black ,</l>
       <l n="51">We drifted softly to dock .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="52">I took the ferry ,</l>
       <l n="53">I crossed the river ,</l>
       <l n="54">I ran almost through the little batch</l>
       <l n="55">Of fishermen 's shacks .</l>
       <l n="56">I climbed the winding road of the hill ,</l>
       <l n="57">And dove in a shadowy quiet</l>
       <l n="58">Of paths of moss and dancing leaves ,</l>
       <l n="59">And straight stretched limbs of giant pines</l>
       <l n="60">On patches of sky .</l>
       <l n="61">I ran to the top of the bluff</l>
       <l n="62">Where the lodge-house stood .</l>
       <l n="63">And there the sunlit lake burst on me</l>
       <l n="64">And wine-like air .</l>
       <l n="65">And below me was the beach</l>
       <l n="66">Where the serried lines of hurrying water</l>
       <l n="67">Came up like rank on rank of men</l>
       <l n="68">And fell with a shout on the rocks !</l>
       <l n="69">I plunged , I stumbled , I ran</l>
       <l n="70">Down the hill ,</l>
       <l n="71">For I thought I saw you ,</l>
       <l n="72">And it was you , you were there !</l>
       <l n="73">And I shall never forget your cry ,</l>
       <l n="74">Nor how you raised your arms and cried ,</l>
       <l n="75">And laughed when you saw me .</l>
       <l n="76">And there we were with the lake</l>
       <l n="77">And the sun with his ruddy search-light blaze</l>
       <l n="78">Stretching back to lost Chicago .</l>
       <l n="79">The sun , the lake , the beach , and ourselves</l>
       <l n="80">Were all that was left of Time ,</l>
       <l n="81">All else was lost .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="82">You were making a camp .</l>
       <l n="83">You had bent from the bank a cedar bough</l>
       <l n="84">And tied it down .</l>
       <l n="85">And over it flung a quilt of many colors ,</l>
       <l n="86">And under it spread on the voluptuous silt</l>
       <l n="87">Gray blankets and canvas pillows .</l>
       <l n="88">I saw it all in a glance .</l>
       <l n="89">And there in dread of eyes we stood</l>
       <l n="90">Scanning the bluff and the beach ,</l>
       <l n="91">Lest in the briefest touch of lips</l>
       <l n="92">We might be seen .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="93">For there were eyes , or we thought</l>
       <l n="94">There were eyes , on the porch of the lodge ,</l>
       <l n="95">And eyes along the forest 's rim on the hill ,</l>
       <l n="96">And eyes on the shore .</l>
       <l n="97">But a minute past there was no sun ,</l>
       <l n="98">Only a star that shone like a match which lights</l>
       <l n="99">To a blue intenseness amid the glow of a hearth .</l>
       <l n="100">And we sat on the sand as dusk came down</l>
       <l n="101">In a communion of silence and low words .</l>
       <l n="102">Till you said at last : “ We 'll sup at the lodge ,</l>
       <l n="103">Then say good night to me and leave</l>
       <l n="104">As if to stay overnight in the village .</l>
       <l n="105">But instead make a long detour through the wood</l>
       <l n="106">And come to the shore through that ravine ,</l>
       <l n="107">Be here at the tent at midnight . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="108">And so I did .</l>
       <l n="109">I stole through echoless ways ,</l>
       <l n="110">Where no twigs broke and where I heard</l>
       <l n="111">My heart beat like a watch under a pillow .</l>
       <l n="112">And the whippoorwills were singing .</l>
       <l n="113">And the sound of the surf below me</l>
       <l n="114">Was the sound of silver-poplar leaves</l>
       <l n="115">In a wind that makes no pause ....</l>
       <l n="116">I hurried down the steep ravine ,</l>
       <l n="117">And a bat flew up at my feet from the brush</l>
       <l n="118">And crossed the moon .</l>
       <l n="119">To my left was the lighthouse ,</l>
       <l n="120">And black and deep purples far away ,</l>
       <l n="121">And all was still .</l>
       <l n="122">Till I stood breathless by the tent</l>
       <l n="123">And heard your whispered welcome ,</l>
       <l n="124">And felt your kiss .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="125">Lovers lay at mid-night</l>
       <l n="126">On roofs of Memphis and Athens</l>
       <l n="127">And looked at tropical stars</l>
       <l n="128">As large as golden beetles .</l>
       <l n="129">Nothing is new , save this ,</l>
       <l n="130">And this is always new .</l>
       <l n="131">And there in your tent</l>
       <l n="132">With the balm of the mid-night breeze</l>
       <l n="133">Sweeping over us ,</l>
       <l n="134">We looked at one great star</l>
       <l n="135">Through a flap of your many-colored tent ,</l>
       <l n="136">And the eternal quality of rapture</l>
       <l n="137">And mystery and vision flowed through us .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="138">Next day we went to Grand Haven ,</l>
       <l n="139">For my desire was your desire ,</l>
       <l n="140">Whatever wish one had the other had .</l>
       <l n="141">And up the Grand River we rowed ,</l>
       <l n="142">With rushes and lily pads about us ,</l>
       <l n="143">And the sand hills back of us ,</l>
       <l n="144">Till we came to a quiet land ,</l>
       <l n="145">A lotus place of farms and meadows .</l>
       <l n="146">And we tied our boat to Schmitty 's dock ,</l>
       <l n="147">Where we had a dinner of fish .</l>
       <l n="148">And where , after resting , to follow your will</l>
       <l n="149">We drifted back to Spring Lake —</l>
       <l n="150">And under a larger moon ,</l>
       <l n="151">Now almost full ,</l>
       <l n="152">Walked three miles to The Beeches ,</l>
       <l n="153">By a winding country road ,</l>
       <l n="154">Where we had supper .</l>
       <l n="155">And afterwards a long sleep ,</l>
       <l n="156">Waking to the song of robins .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="157">And that day I said :</l>
       <l n="158">There are wild places , blue water , pine forests ,</l>
       <l n="159">There are apple orchards , and wonderful roads</l>
       <l n="160">Around Elk Lake — shall we go ?</l>
       <l n="161">And we went , for your desire was mine .</l>
       <l n="162">And there we climbed hills ,</l>
       <l n="163">And ate apples along the shaded ways ,</l>
       <l n="164">And rolled great boulders down the steeps</l>
       <l n="165">To watch them splash in the water .</l>
       <l n="166">And we stood and wondered what was beyond</l>
       <l n="167">The farther shore two miles away .</l>
       <l n="168">And we came to a place on the shore</l>
       <l n="169">Where four great pine trees stood ,</l>
       <l n="170">And underneath them wild flowers to the edge</l>
       <l n="171">Of sand so soft for naked feet .</l>
       <l n="172">And here , for not a soul was near ,</l>
       <l n="173">We stripped and swam far out , laughing , rejoicing ,</l>
       <l n="174">Rolling and diving in those great depths</l>
       <l n="175">Of bracing water under a glittering sun .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="176">There were farm houses enough</l>
       <l n="177">For food and shelter .</l>
       <l n="178">But something urged us on .</l>
       <l n="179">One knows the end and dreads the end</l>
       <l n="180">Yet seeks the end .</l>
       <l n="181">And you asked , “ Is there a town near ?</l>
       <l n="182">Let 's see a town . ”</l>
       <l n="183">So we walked to Traverse City</l>
       <l n="184">Through cut-over land and blasted</l>
       <l n="185">Trunks and stumps of pine ,</l>
       <l n="186">And by the side of desolate hills .</l>
       <l n="187">But when we got to Traverse City</l>
       <l n="188">You were not content , nor was I .</l>
       <l n="189">Something urged us on .</l>
       <l n="190">Then you thought of Northport</l>
       <l n="191">And of its Norse and German fishermen ,</l>
       <l n="192">And its quaint piers where they smoke fish .</l>
       <l n="193">So we drove for thirty miles</l>
       <l n="194">In a speeding automobile</l>
       <l n="195">Over hills , around sudden curves , into warm coverts ,</l>
       <l n="196">Or hollows , sometimes at the edge of the Bay ,</l>
       <l n="197">Again on the hill ,</l>
       <l n="198">From where we could see Old Mission</l>
       <l n="199">Amid blues and blacks , across a score of miles of the Bay ,</l>
       <l n="200">Waving like watered silk under the moon !</l>
       <l n="201">And by meadows of clover newly cut ,</l>
       <l n="202">And by peach orchards and vineyards .</l>
       <l n="203">But when we came to the little town</l>
       <l n="204">Already asleep , though it was but eight o'clock ,</l>
       <l n="205">And only a few drowsy lamps</l>
       <l n="206">With misty eyelids shone from a store or two ,</l>
       <l n="207">I said , “ Do you see those twinkling lights ?</l>
       <l n="208">That 's Northport Point , that 's the Cedar Cabin —</l>
       <l n="209">Let 's go to the Cedar Cabin . ”</l>
       <l n="210">And so we crossed the Bay</l>
       <l n="211">Amid great waves in a plunging launch ,</l>
       <l n="212">And a roaring breeze and a great moon ,</l>
       <l n="213">For now the moon was full .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="214">So here was the Cedar Cabin</l>
       <l n="215">On a strip of land as wide as a house and lawn ,</l>
       <l n="216">And on one side Lake Michigan ,</l>
       <l n="217">And on one side the Bay .</l>
       <l n="218">There were distances of color all around ,</l>
       <l n="219">And stars and darknesses of land and trees ,</l>
       <l n="220">And at the point the lighthouse .</l>
       <l n="221">And over us the moon ,</l>
       <l n="222">And over the balcony of our room</l>
       <l n="223">All of these , where we lay till I slept ,</l>
       <l n="224">Listening to the water of the lake ,</l>
       <l n="225">And the water of the Bay .</l>
       <l n="226">And we saw the moon sink like a red bomb ,</l>
       <l n="227">And we saw the stars change</l>
       <l n="228">As the sky wheeled ....</l>
       <l n="229">Now this was the end of the earth ,</l>
       <l n="230">For this strip of land</l>
       <l n="231">Ran out to a point no larger than one of the stumps</l>
       <l n="232">We saw on the desolate hills .</l>
       <l n="233">And moreover it seemed to dive under ,</l>
       <l n="234">Or waste away in a sudden depth of water .</l>
       <l n="235">And around it was a swirl ,</l>
       <l n="236">To the north the bounding waves of the Lake ,</l>
       <l n="237">And to the south the Bay which seemed the Lake .</l>
       <l n="238">But could we speak of it , even though</l>
       <l n="239">I saw your eyes when you thought of it ?</l>
       <l n="240">A sigh of wind blew through the rustic temple</l>
       <l n="241">When we saw this symbol together ,</l>
       <l n="242">And neither spoke .</l>
       <l n="243">But that night , somewhere in the beginning of drowsiness ,</l>
       <l n="244">You said : “ There is no further place to go ,</l>
       <l n="245">We must retrace . ”</l>
       <l n="246">And I awoke in a torrent of light in the room ,</l>
       <l n="247">Hearing voices and steps on the walk :</l>
       <l n="248">I looked for you ,</l>
       <l n="249">But you had arisen .</l>
       <l n="250">Then I dressed and searched for you ,</l>
       <l n="251">But you were gone .</l>
       <l n="252">Then I stood for long minutes</l>
       <l n="253">Looking at a sail far out at sea</l>
       <l n="254">And departed too .</l>

      <head>THE STAR</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I am a certain god</l>
       <l n="2">Who slipped down from a remote height</l>
       <l n="3">To a place of pools and stars .</l>
       <l n="4">And I sat invisible</l>
       <l n="5">Amid a clump of trees</l>
       <l n="6">To watch the madmen .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">There were cries and groans about me ,</l>
       <l n="8">And shouts of laughter and curses .</l>
       <l n="9">Figures passed by with self-absorbed contempt ,</l>
       <l n="10">Wrinkling in bitter smiles about their lips .</l>
       <l n="11">Others hurried on with set eyes</l>
       <l n="12">Pursuing something .</l>
       <l n="13">Then I said this is the place for mad Frederick —</l>
       <l n="14">Mad Frederick will be here .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">But everywhere I could see</l>
       <l n="16">Figures sitting or standing</l>
       <l n="17">By little pools .</l>
       <l n="18">Some seemed grown into the soil</l>
       <l n="19">And were helpless .</l>
       <l n="20">And of these some were asleep .</l>
       <l n="21">Others laughed the laughter</l>
       <l n="22">That comes from dying men</l>
       <l n="23">Trying to face Death .</l>
       <l n="24">And others said “ I should be content , ”</l>
       <l n="25">And others said “ I will fly . ”</l>
       <l n="26">Whereupon sepulchral voices muttered ,</l>
       <l n="27">As of creatures sitting or hanging head down</l>
       <l n="28">From limbs of the trees ,</l>
       <l n="29">“ We will not let you . ”</l>
       <l n="30">And others looked in their pools</l>
       <l n="31">And clasped hands and said “ Gone , all gone . ”</l>
       <l n="32">By other pools there were dead bodies :</l>
       <l n="33">Some of youth , some of age .</l>
       <l n="34">They had given up the fight ,</l>
       <l n="35">They had drunk poisoned water ,</l>
       <l n="36">They had searched</l>
       <l n="37">Until they fell —</l>
       <l n="38">All had gone mad !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="39">Then I , a certain god ,</l>
       <l n="40">Curious to know</l>
       <l n="41">What it is in pools and stars</l>
       <l n="42">That drives men and women</l>
       <l n="43">Over the earth in this quest</l>
       <l n="44">Waited for mad Frederick .</l>
       <l n="45">And then I heard his step .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="46">I knew that long ago</l>
       <l n="47">He sat by one of these pools</l>
       <l n="48">Enraptured of a star 's image .</l>
       <l n="49">And that hands , for his own good ,</l>
       <l n="50">As they said ,</l>
       <l n="51">Dumped clay into the pool</l>
       <l n="52">And blotted his star .</l>
       <l n="53">And I knew that after that</l>
       <l n="54">He had said , “ They will never spy again</l>
       <l n="55">Upon my ecstasy .</l>
       <l n="56">They will never see me watching one star .</l>
       <l n="57">I will fly by rivers ,</l>
       <l n="58">And by little brooks ,</l>
       <l n="59">And by the edge of lakes ,</l>
       <l n="60">And by little bends of water ,</l>
       <l n="61">Where no wind blows ,</l>
       <l n="62">And glance at stars as I pass .</l>
       <l n="63">They will never spy again</l>
       <l n="64">Upon my ecstasy . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="65">And I knew that mad Frederick</l>
       <l n="66">In this flight</l>
       <l n="67">Through years of restless and madness</l>
       <l n="68">Was caught by the image of a star</l>
       <l n="69">In a mere beyond a meadow</l>
       <l n="70">Down from a hill , under a forest ,</l>
       <l n="71">And had said ,</l>
       <l n="72">“ No one sees ;</l>
       <l n="73">Here I can find life ,</l>
       <l n="74">Through vision of eternal things . ”</l>
       <l n="75">But they had followed him .</l>
       <l n="76">They stood on the brow of the hill ,</l>
       <l n="77">And when they saw him gazing in the water</l>
       <l n="78">They rolled a great stone down the hill ,</l>
       <l n="79">And shattered the star 's image .</l>
       <l n="80">Then mad Frederick fled with laughter .</l>
       <l n="81">It echoed through the wood .</l>
       <l n="82">And he said , “ I will look for moons ,</l>
       <l n="83">I will punish them who disturb me ,</l>
       <l n="84">By worshiping moons . ”</l>
       <l n="85">But when he sought moons</l>
       <l n="86">They left him alone ,</l>
       <l n="87">And he did not want the moons .</l>
       <l n="88">And he was alone , and sick from the moons ,</l>
       <l n="89">And covered as with a white blankness ,</l>
       <l n="90">Which was the worst madness of all .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="91">And I , a certain god ,</l>
       <l n="92">Waiting for mad Frederick</l>
       <l n="93">To enter this place of pools and stars ,</l>
       <l n="94">Saw him at last .</l>
       <l n="95">With a sigh he looked about upon his fellows</l>
       <l n="96">Sitting or standing by their pools .</l>
       <l n="97">And some of the pools were covered with scum ,</l>
       <l n="98">And some were glazed as of filth ,</l>
       <l n="99">And some were grown with weeds ,</l>
       <l n="100">And some were congealed as of the north wind ,</l>
       <l n="101">And a few were yet pure ,</l>
       <l n="102">And held the star 's image .</l>
       <l n="103">And by these some sat and were glad ,</l>
       <l n="104">Others had lost the vision .</l>
       <l n="105">The star was there , but its meaning vanished .</l>
       <l n="106">And mad Frederick , going here and there ,</l>
       <l n="107">With no purpose ,</l>
       <l n="108">Only curious and interested</l>
       <l n="109">As I was , a certain god ,</l>
       <l n="110">Came by a certain pool</l>
       <l n="111">And saw a star .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="112">He shivered ,</l>
       <l n="113">He clasped his hands ,</l>
       <l n="114">He sank to his knees ,</l>
       <l n="115">He touched his lips to the water .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="116">Then voices from the limbs of the trees muttered :</l>
       <l n="117">“ There he is again . ”</l>
       <l n="118">“ He must be driven away . ”</l>
       <l n="119">“ The pool is not his . ”</l>
       <l n="120">“ He does not belong here . ”</l>
       <l n="121">So as when bats fly in a cave</l>
       <l n="122">They swooped from their hidings in the trees</l>
       <l n="123">And dashed themselves in the pool .</l>
       <l n="124">Then I saw what these flying things were —</l>
       <l n="125">But no matter .</l>
       <l n="126">They were illusions , evil and envious</l>
       <l n="127">And dull ,</l>
       <l n="128">But with power to destroy .</l>
       <l n="129">And mad Frederick turned away from the pool</l>
       <l n="130">And covered his eyes with his arms .</l>
       <l n="131">Then a certain god ,</l>
       <l n="132">Of less power than mine ,</l>
       <l n="133">Came and sat beside me and said :</l>
       <l n="134">“ Why do you allow this to be ?</l>
       <l n="135">They are all seeking ,</l>
       <l n="136">Why do you not let them find their heart 's delight ?</l>
       <l n="137">Why do you allow this to be ? ”</l>
       <l n="138">But I did not answer .</l>
       <l n="139">The lesser god did not know</l>
       <l n="140">That I have no power ,</l>
       <l n="141">That only the God has the power .</l>
       <l n="142">And that this must be</l>
       <l n="143">In spite of all lesser gods .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="144">And I saw mad Frederick</l>
       <l n="145">Arise and ascend to the top of a high hill ,</l>
       <l n="146">And I saw him find the star</l>
       <l n="147">Whose image he had seen in the pool .</l>
       <l n="148">Then he knelt and prayed :</l>
       <l n="149">“ Give me to understand , O Star ,</l>
       <l n="150">Your inner self , your eternal spirit ,</l>
       <l n="151">That I may have you and not images of you ,</l>
       <l n="152">So that I may know what has driven me through the world ,</l>
       <l n="153">And may cure my soul .</l>
       <l n="154">For I know you are Eternal Love ,</l>
       <l n="155">And I can never escape you .</l>
       <l n="156">And if I cannot escape you ,</l>
       <l n="157">Then I must serve you .</l>
       <l n="158">And if I must serve you ,</l>
       <l n="159">It must be to good and not ill —</l>
       <l n="160">You have brought me from the forest of pools</l>
       <l n="161">And the images of stars ,</l>
       <l n="162">Here to the hill 's top .</l>
       <l n="163">Where now do I go ?</l>
       <l n="164">And what shall I do ? ”</l>

   <div type="otherbooks">
    <p>Author of “ The Porcupine , ” “ Captain Craig and Other Poems , ” etc . Cloth , 12mo , $ 1. 00 It has been some years since Mr. Robinson has given us a new collection of poems . Those who remember “ Captain Craig and Other Poems , ” a volume which brought to its author the heartiest of congratulations , placing him at once in the rank of those American writers whose contributions to literature are of permanent value , will welcome this new work and will find that their anticipation of it and hopes for it are to be pleasantly realized . It is a book which well carries out that early promise and which helps to maintain Mr. Robinson 's position in letters to-day . THE MACMILLAN COMPANY Publishers 64-66 Fifth Avenue New York Battle and Other Poems BY WILFRID WILSON GIBSON Author of “ Daily Bread , ” “ Fires , ” etc . Cloth , 12mo Here with that intensely human note exhibited in his poems of the working classes , Mr. Gibson sings of the life of the soldier . There are many moods in the book , for the author has well caught the flow of spirits from gaiety to despair which makes up the soldier 's days . The chief characteristic of the little pen pictures is their vividness , the way in which they bring before the reader the thoughts and feelings of those whose lives may be offered up for their country any moment . In addition to these poems of battle there are others in the collection on varying themes .

Professor Barrett Wendell , of Harvard University , says : “ Seems to me as unusual — in the happiest sense of the word , ... I find the book a model , in total effect , of what a work with such purpose ought to be . ” William Lyon Phelps , Professor of English Literature , Yale University , says : “ This is , I think , the most valuable work on contemporary French literature that I have seen for a long time . It is written by one who has a thorough knowledge of the subject and who is herself an American poet of distinction . She has the knowledge , the sympathy , the penetration , and the insight — all necessary to make a notable book of criticism . It is a work that should be widely read in America . ” OTHER BOOKS BY AMY LOWELL Sword Blades and Poppy Seed Boards , 12mo , $ 1. 25 “ From the standard of pure poetry , Miss Lowell 's poem , ‘ The Book of the Hours of Sister Clotilde ’ is one of the loveliest in our poetry , worthy of companionship to the great romantic lyrics of Coleridge . ” — Boston Transcript .
