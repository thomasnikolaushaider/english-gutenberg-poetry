     <l n="133">It was morning at St. Helen 's , in the great and gallant days ,</l>
     <l n="134">And the sea beneath the sun glittered wide ,</l>
     <l n="135">When the frigate set her courses , all a-shimmer in the haze</l>
     <l n="136">And she hauled her cable home and took the tide .</l>
     <l n="137">She 'd a right fighting company , three hundred men and more ,</l>
     <l n="138">Nine and forty guns in tackle running free ;</l>
     <l n="139">And they cheered her from the shore for her colours at the fore ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="145">She was clear of Monte Cristo , she was heading for the land ,</l>
     <l n="146">When she spied a pennant red and white and blue ;</l>
     <l n="147">They were foemen , and they knew it , and they 'd half a league in hand ,</l>
     <l n="148">But she flung aloft her royals , and she flew .</l>
     <l n="149">She was nearer , nearer , nearer , they were caught beyond a doubt ,</l>
     <l n="150">But they slipped her into Orbetello Bay ,</l>
     <l n="151">And the lubbers gave a shout as they paid their cables out ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="153">Now , Sir Peter was a captain of a famous fighting race ,</l>

     <l n="157">And he called across the decks , “ Ay ! the cheering might be late</l>
     <l n="158">If they kept it till the Menelaus runs ;</l>
     <l n="159">Bid the master and his mate heave the lead and lay her straight</l>

     <l n="164">And in silence every gunner took his post .</l>
     <l n="165">With a volley from her broadside the citadel she woke ,</l>
     <l n="166">And they hammered back like heroes all the night ;</l>

     <l n="202">The guns that should have conquered us they rusted on the shore ,</l>

    <p n="4">The two last stanzas have been misunderstood . It seems , therefore , necessary to state that they are intended to refer to Turner 's picture in the National Gallery of “ The Fighting Téméraire Tugged to her Last Berth . ”</p>

Baird , then a young captain in the 73rd , was left for dead on the field . He was afterwards , with forty-nine other officers , kept in prison at Seringapatam , and treated with Oriental barbarity and treachery by Hyder Ali and his son Tippoo Sahib , Sultans of Mysore . Twenty-three of the prisoners died by poison , torture , and fever ; the rest were surrendered in 1784 . In 1799 , at the siege of Seringapatam , Major-General Baird commanded the first European brigade , and volunteered to lead the storming column .
