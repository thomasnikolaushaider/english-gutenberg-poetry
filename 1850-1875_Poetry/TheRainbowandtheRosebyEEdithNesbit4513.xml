     <l n="1">NOW that I 've nearly done my days ,</l>
     <l n="2">And grown too stiff to sweep or sew ,</l>
     <l n="3">I sit and think , till I 'm amaze ,</l>
     <l n="4">About what lots of things I know :</l>
     <l n="5">Things as I 've found out one by one —</l>
     <l n="6">And when I 'm fast down in the clay ,</l>
     <l n="7">My knowing things and how they 're done</l>
     <l n="8">Will all be lost and thrown away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">There 's things , I know , as wo n't be lost ,</l>
     <l n="10">Things as folks write and talk about :</l>
     <l n="11">The way to keep your roots from frost ,</l>
     <l n="12">And how to get your ink spots out .</l>
     <l n="13">What medicine 's good for sores and sprains ,</l>
     <l n="14">What way to salt your butter down ,</l>
     <l n="15">What charms will cure your different pains ,</l>
     <l n="16">And what will bright your faded gown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">But more important things than these ,</l>
     <l n="18">They can n't be written in a book :</l>
     <l n="19">How fast to boil your greens and peas ,</l>
     <l n="20">And how good bacon ought to look ;</l>
     <l n="21">The feel of real good wearing stuff ,</l>
     <l n="22">The kind of apple as will keep ,</l>
     <l n="23">The look of bread that 's rose enough ,</l>
     <l n="24">And how to get a child asleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Whether the jam is fit to pot ,</l>
     <l n="26">Whether the milk is going to turn ,</l>
     <l n="27">Whether a hen will lay or not ,</l>
     <l n="28">Is things as some folks never learn .</l>
     <l n="29">I know the weather by the sky ,</l>
     <l n="30">I know what herbs grow in what lane ;</l>
     <l n="31">And if sick men are going to die ,</l>
     <l n="32">Or if they 'll get about again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Young wives come in , a-smiling , grave ,</l>
     <l n="34">With secrets that they itch to tell :</l>
     <l n="35">I know what sort of times they 'll have ,</l>
     <l n="36">And if they 'll have a boy or gell .</l>
     <l n="37">And if a lad is ill to bind ,</l>
     <l n="38">Or some young maid is hard to lead ,</l>
     <l n="39">I know when you should speak ‘ em kind ,</l>
     <l n="40">And when it 's scolding as they need .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">I used to know where birds ud set ,</l>
     <l n="42">And likely spots for trout or hare ,</l>
     <l n="43">And God may want me to forget</l>
     <l n="44">The way to set a line or snare ;</l>
     <l n="45">But not the way to truss a chick ,</l>
     <l n="46">To fry a fish , or baste a roast ,</l>
     <l n="47">Nor how to tell , when folks are sick ,</l>
     <l n="48">What kind of herb will ease them most !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">Forgetting seems such silly waste !</l>
     <l n="50">I know so many little things ,</l>
     <l n="51">And now the Angels will make haste</l>
     <l n="52">To dust it all away with wings !</l>
     <l n="53">O God , you made me like to know ,</l>
     <l n="54">You kept the things straight in my head ,</l>
     <l n="55">Please God , if you can make it so ,</l>
     <l n="56">Let me know something when I 'm dead .</l>

    <head>THE CONFESSION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I HAVEN'T always acted good :</l>
     <l n="2">I 've taken things not meant for me ;</l>
     <l n="3">Not other people 's drink and food ,</l>
     <l n="4">But things they never seemed to see .</l>
     <l n="5">I have n't done the way I ought</l>
     <l n="6">If all they say in church is true ,</l>
     <l n="7">But all I 've had I 've fairly bought ,</l>
     <l n="8">And paid for pretty heavy too .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">For days and weeks are very long</l>
     <l n="10">If you get nothing new and bright ,</l>
     <l n="11">And if you never do no wrong</l>
     <l n="12">Somehow you never do no right .</l>
     <l n="13">The chap that daresent go a yard</l>
     <l n="14">For fear the path should lead astray</l>
     <l n="15">May be a saint — though that seems hard ,</l>
     <l n="16">But he 's no traveller , any way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Some things I can n't be sorry for ,</l>
     <l n="18">The things that silly people hate :</l>
     <l n="19">But some I did I do deplore ,</l>
     <l n="20">I knew , inside , they was n't straight .</l>
     <l n="21">And when my last account is filed ,</l>
     <l n="22">And stuck-up angels stop their song ,</l>
     <l n="23">I 'll ask God 's pardon like a child</l>
     <l n="24">For what I really knew was wrong .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">If you 've a child , you 'd rather see</l>
     <l n="26">A bit of temper , off and on ,</l>
     <l n="27">A greedy grab , a silly spree —</l>
     <l n="28">And then a brave thing said or done</l>
     <l n="29">Than hear your boy whine all day long</l>
     <l n="30">About the things he mus n't do :</l>
     <l n="31">Just doing nothing , right or wrong :</l>
     <l n="32">And God may feel the same as you .</l>

     <l n="33">For God 's our Father , so they say ,</l>
     <l n="34">He made His laws and He made me ;</l>
     <l n="35">He 'll understand about the way</l>
     <l n="36">Me and His laws could not agree .</l>
     <l n="37">He might say , “ You 're worth more , My son ,</l>
     <l n="38">Than all My laws since law began .</l>
     <l n="39">Take good with bad — here 's something done —</l>

    <head>WORK .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHEN I am busying about ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sewing on buttons , tapes , and strings ,</l>
     <l n="3">Hanging the week 's wet washing out</l>
     <l n="4">Or ironing the children 's things ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sweeping and dusting , cleaning grates ,</l>
     <l n="6">Scrubbing the dresser or the floors ,</l>
     <l n="7">Washing the greasy dinner plates ,</l>
     <l n="8">Scouring the brasses on the doors —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">I wonder what it 's all about ,</l>
     <l n="10">And when did people first begin</l>
     <l n="11">To keep the dirt and wornness out</l>
     <l n="12">And keep the wholesome comfort in :</l>
     <l n="13">How long it is since women bore</l>
     <l n="14">This round of wash and make and mend ,</l>
     <l n="15">And what God makes us do it for</l>
     <l n="16">And whether it will ever end !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">When God began to do His work</l>
     <l n="18">He made a new thing every day —</l>
     <l n="19">Even now He is not one to shirk ,</l>
     <l n="20">But makes things , always some new way</l>
     <l n="21">He made the earth , and sky , and sun ,</l>
     <l n="22">The creatures of the sea and wood ,</l>
     <l n="23">And when his first week 's work was done</l>
     <l n="24">He saw that it was very good .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">But He — for all He worked so fast</l>
     <l n="26">To finish air , and wave , and shore ,</l>
     <l n="27">Knew that this work of His would last</l>
     <l n="28">For ever and for evermore .</l>
     <l n="29">On Saturday night He was content ,</l>
     <l n="30">He knew that Monday would not bring</l>
     <l n="31">Need for another firmament ,</l>
     <l n="32">Another set of everything .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">But though my work is easier far</l>
     <l n="34">Than making sky and sea and sun ,</l>
     <l n="35">It 's harder than God 's labours are ,</l>
     <l n="36">Because my work is never done .</l>
     <l n="37">I sweep and churn , save and contrive ,</l>
     <l n="38">I bake and brew , I do n't complain ,</l>
     <l n="39">But every Monday morning I 've</l>
     <l n="40">Last Monday 's work to do again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">I 'm good at work — I work away ;</l>
     <l n="42">Always the same my work must go ;</l>
     <l n="43">The flowers grow different every day ,</l>
     <l n="44">That 's why I like to see them grow .</l>
     <l n="45">If , up in Heaven , God understood</l>
     <l n="46">He 'd let me for my Paradise</l>
     <l n="47">Make all things new and very good</l>
     <l n="48">And never make the same thing twice !</l>

    <head>THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">You need n't pray for me , old lady , I do n't want no one 's prayer ,</l>
     <l n="2">I 'm fit and jolly as ever I was — you need n't think I care .</l>
     <l n="3">When I go whistling down the road , when the warm night is falling ,</l>
     <l n="4">She need n't think I 'm whistling her , it 's another girl I 'm calling .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">If I pass her house a dozen times , or fifty times a day ,</l>
     <l n="6">She need n't think I think of her , my work lies out that way .</l>
     <l n="7">If they should tell her I 've grown thin ( for that is what they 've told me )</l>
     <l n="8">This cursed weather counts for that , and not the girl who sold me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And if they say I 'm off my feed I still can tip a can ;</l>
     <l n="10">If I get drunk what 's that to her ? I am not her young man .</l>
     <l n="11">I know I 've had a lucky let-off — she ai n't no class , she ai n't ,</l>
     <l n="12">For all she looked like a bush o ’ roses and talked like a story book saint .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">I never give a thought to her . Do n't worry your old head ,</l>
     <l n="14">I 've quite forgot her pretty ways and the cruel things she said ,</l>
     <l n="15">There 's lots of other gals to be had as any chap can see ,</l>
     <l n="16">So you cheer up , you 've got no call to go and pray for me .</l>
     <l n="17">But all the same , if you want to pray , you 'd best pray God take care of them ,</l>
     <l n="18">For if I catch them two together , by hell ! I 'll swing for the pair of them .</l>

    <head>THE WILL TO LIVE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SINCE Faith is a veil that has nothing behind it ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Hope wanders lost where no mortal can find it ,</l>
     <l n="3">Since Love is a mirror we break in a minute</l>
     <l n="4">In snatching the image our soul has cast in it ,</l>
     <l n="5">What is the use of the Summers and Springs ,</l>
     <l n="6">The wave of the woods and the waft of the wings —</l>
     <l n="7">Since all means nothing , and good things and ill</l>
     <l n="8">Make madness ,— a mirage tormenting us still ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Since all the fighting , the ardent endeavour ,</l>
     <l n="10">The heart cast bleeding to feed the Ideal ,</l>
     <l n="11">Are vain , vain , vain , and the one thing real</l>
     <l n="12">Is that all 's vain , for ever and ever ;</l>
     <l n="13">Why then , be a man and stand back from the strife ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fall by the sword , but keep out of the snare ;</l>
     <l n="15">Will but to be — and be willing to bear</l>
     <l n="16">All that the gods may lay on your of life !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">In the far East , where light ever dawns first ,</l>
     <l n="18">There has man learned how the Fates may be cheated ,</l>
     <l n="19">How by our craft may their strength be defeated ,</l>
     <l n="20">Though all our best be no match for their worst !</l>
     <l n="21">Kill the desire that they set in your bosom ,</l>
     <l n="22">Long not for fruit when you gaze on the blossom ,</l>
     <l n="23">Dream not of flowers when you gaze on the bud ,</l>
     <l n="24">Kill all the rebels that shout in your blood .</l>
     <l n="25">Sorrow and sickness , disease and decay —</l>
     <l n="26">These toll the hours of Life 's desolate day ;</l>
     <l n="27">Hopes unfulfilled and forbidden delight</l>
     <l n="28">These are the dreams of Life 's treacherous night .</l>
     <l n="29">So let me image an infinite peace</l>
     <l n="30">Touched with no joy but the ease of release .</l>
     <l n="31">Out of the eddies I climb and I cease</l>
     <l n="32">Keeping , in change for this man 's soul of me ,</l>
     <l n="33">Something which , by the eternal decree ,</l>
     <l n="34">Is as like Nothing as Something can be !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">Not to desire , to admit , to adore ,</l>
     <l n="36">Casting the robe of the soul that you wore</l>
     <l n="37">Just as the soul casts the body 's robe down .</l>
     <l n="38">This is man 's destiny , this is man 's crown .</l>
     <l n="39">This is the splendour , the end of the feast ;</l>
     <l n="40">This is the light of the Star in the East .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">So , Silence reconciles Life 's jarring phrases</l>
     <l n="42">Far in the future , austere and august :</l>
     <l n="43">Meanwhile , the buds of the poplars are falling ,</l>
     <l n="44">Spring 's on the lawn , and a little voice calling :</l>
     <l n="45">“ Daddy , come out ! Daddy darling , you must !</l>
     <l n="46">Daddy come out and help Molly pick daisies ! ”</l>
     <l n="47">And , since one 's here , and the Spring 's in the garden</l>
     <l n="48">( How many lives hence will that thought earn pardon ? )</l>
     <l n="49">Since one 's a man and man 's heart is insistent ,</l>
     <l n="50">And , since Nirvana is doubtful and distant ,</l>
     <l n="51">Though life 's a hard road and thorny to travel —</l>
     <l n="52">Stones in the borders and grass on the gravel ,</l>
     <l n="53">Still there 's the wisdom that wise men call folly ,</l>
     <l n="54">Still one can go and pick daisies with Molly !</l>

     <l n="2">Fluttering in the sun , between the green and blue ,</l>
     <l n="3">Wheeling , whirling , poising , lovely and elusive ,</l>
     <l n="4">How to cage the flying thoughts , my winged delight , for you ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Set a springe of rhyme , and hope to catch them in it ? Strew my love as grain to lure them to the snare ? Watch the hours built up , slow minute piled on minute ? Still the wide sky guards their flight , and still the cage is bare .</p>
   <p>Gleam of hovering feathers , brushing me to flout me ! Wings , be weary ! Rest ! Who loves you more than I ? Caught ? Oh fluttering pinions whitening air about me ! Rustling wings , and distant flight , and empty cage and sky !</p>
   <p>THE MAIDEN 'S PRAYER .</p>
   <p>SPRING , pretty Spring , what treasure do you bring to me ? Green grass and buttercups , cherry-bloom and may ? Sunshine to be glad with me , and little birds to sing to me ? Warm nests to call me along the woodland way ?</p>
   <p>Spring , happy Spring , what wonder will you do for me ? Light the tulip lanterns , and set the furze a-fire ? Fill your sky with sails of cloud on waves of living blue for me ? Show me green cornfields and budding of the briar ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Spring , darling Spring , my days will not return to me ,</l>
     <l n="2">You who see them fleeting , you , all time above ,</l>
     <l n="3">You who move the whole world 's heart , ah move one heart to turn to me ,</l>
     <l n="4">— Bring me a lover , and teach me how to love !</l>

     <l n="1">Who Died on October 25th , 1899 .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">THERE was a day ,</l>
     <l n="3">A horrible Autumn day ,</l>
     <l n="4">When from her home , the home she made for ours</l>
     <l n="5">And that day made a nightmare of white flowers</l>
     <l n="6">And folk in black who whispered pityingly ,</l>
     <l n="7">They carried her away ;</l>
     <l n="8">And left our hearts all cold</l>
     <l n="9">And empty , yet with such a store to hold</l>
     <l n="10">Of sodden grief the slow drops still ooze out ,</l>
     <l n="11">And , falling on all fair things , they wither these .</l>
     <l n="12">Tears came with time — but not with time went by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">And still we wander desolate about</l>
     <l n="14">The poor changed house , the garden and the croft ,</l>
     <l n="15">Warm kitchen , sunny parlour , with the soft</l>
     <l n="16">Intolerable pervading memories</l>
     <l n="17">Of her whose face and voice made melodies ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sweet unforgotten songs of mother-love —</l>
     <l n="19">Dear songs of all the little joys that were .</l>
     <l n="20">We see the sun , and have no joy thereof ,</l>
     <l n="21">Because she gathered in her dying hands</l>
     <l n="22">And carried with her to the fair far lands</l>
     <l n="23">The flower of all our joy , because she went</l>
     <l n="24">Out of the garden where her days were spent ,</l>
     <l n="25">And took the very sun away with her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">The cross stands at her head .</l>
     <l n="27">Over her breast , that loving mother-breast ,</l>
     <l n="28">Close buds of pansies purple and white are pressed .</l>
     <l n="29">It seems a place for rest ,</l>
     <l n="30">For happy folded sleep ; but ah , not there ,</l>
     <l n="31">Not there , not there , our hardest tears are shed ,</l>
     <l n="32">But in the house made empty for her sake .</l>
     <l n="33">Here , in the night intolerable , wake</l>
     <l n="34">The hungry passionate pains of Love still strong</l>
     <l n="35">To fight with death the bitter slow night long .</l>
     <l n="36">Then the rich price that poor Love has to pay</l>
     <l n="37">Is paid , slow drop by drop , till the new day</l>
     <l n="38">With thin cold fingers pushes back night 's wings ,</l>
     <l n="39">And drags us out to common cruel things</l>
     <l n="40">That sting , and barb their stings with memory .</l>
     <l n="41">O Love — and is the price too hard to give ?</l>
     <l n="42">Thine is the splendour of all things that live ,</l>
     <l n="43">And this thy pain the price of life to thee —</l>
     <l n="44">The sacrament that binds to the beloved ,</l>
     <l n="45">The chain that holds though mountains be removed ,</l>
     <l n="46">The portent of thine immortality .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">So , in the house of pain imprisoned , we</l>
     <l n="48">Endure our bondage , and work out our time ,</l>
     <l n="49">Nor seek from out our dungeon walls to climb —</l>
     <l n="50">Bondsmen , who would not , if we could , be free .</l>
     <l n="51">Thank God , our hands still hold Love 's cord — and she —</l>
     <l n="52">Do not her hands still clasp the cord we hold ,</l>
     <l n="53">Drawing us near , coiling bright fold on fold ,</l>
     <l n="54">Till the far day when it shall draw us near</l>
     <l n="55">To the sight of her — her living hands , her dear</l>
     <l n="56">Tired face , grown weary of watching for our face ?</l>
     <l n="57">And we shall hold her , in the happy place ,</l>
     <l n="58">And hear her voice , the old same voice we knew —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="60">Or , in some world more beautiful and dear</l>

     <l n="63">She longed for , and so little a while away ,</l>
     <l n="64">When all the love we watered with our tears</l>
     <l n="65">Shall bloom , transplanted by the kindly years ?</l>
     <l n="66">Dreaming through her new garden does she go ,</l>
     <l n="67">Remembering the old garden , long ago ,</l>
     <l n="68">Tending new flowers more fair than those that grow</l>
     <l n="69">In this sad garden where such sad flowers blow ;</l>
     <l n="70">And , fondly touching bud and leaf and shoot ,</l>
     <l n="71">Training her flowers to perfect branch and root ,</l>
     <l n="72">Does she sometimes entreat some darling flower</l>
     <l n="73">To wait a little for its opening hour ?</l>
     <l n="74">Can you not hear her voice : “ Ah , not to-day ,</l>
     <l n="75">While my dear flowers , my own , are far away .</l>
     <l n="76">Be patient , bud ! to-morrow soon will come :</l>

     <l n="78">But now . But here .</l>
     <l n="79">The empty house , the always empty place —</l>
     <l n="80">The black remembrance that no night blots out ,</l>
     <l n="81">The memories , white , unbearable , and dear</l>
     <l n="82">That no white sunlight makes less cruel and clear ?</l>
     <l n="83">The resistless riotous rout</l>
     <l n="84">Of cruel conquering thoughts , the night , the day ?</l>
     <l n="85">Love is immortal : this the price to pay .</l>
     <l n="86">Worse than all pain it would be to forget —</l>
     <l n="87">On Love 's brave brow the crown of thorns is set .</l>
     <l n="88">Love is no niggard : though the price be high</l>
     <l n="89">Into God 's market Love goes forth to buy</l>
     <l n="90">With royal meed God 's greatest gifts and gain ,</l>
     <l n="91">Love offers up his whole rich store of pain ,</l>
     <l n="92">And buys of God Love 's immortality .</l>

    <head>A PARTING .</head>
     <l n="1">I WILL not wake you , dear ; no tears shall creep</l>
     <l n="2">To chill the still bed where you lie asleep ;</l>
     <l n="3">No cry , no word , shall break the sanctity</l>

     <l n="5">I will not tease your grave with flower or stone ;</l>
     <l n="6">You are tired , my heart ; you shall be left alone .</l>
     <l n="7">And even the kisses that my lips must lay</l>
     <l n="8">Upon the mould of the triumphant clay</l>
     <l n="9">Shall be so soft — like those a mother lays</l>
     <l n="10">Upon her sleeping baby 's little face —</l>
     <l n="11">You will not feel my kisses , will not hear ;</l>
     <l n="12">You are tired : sleep on , I will not wake you , dear !</l>
     <l n="13">But when the good day comes , you will hear me cry ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ Ah , make a little place where I can lie ! ”</l>
     <l n="15">And half awakened , you will feel me creep</l>
     <l n="16">Into the folds of your familiar sleep ,</l>
     <l n="17">And draw them round us , with a tender moan ,</l>
     <l n="18">“ How could you let me sleep so long alone ? ”</l>
