    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="1">The poems of this volume , gathered here after many requests , are , with a few exceptions , from my previous lyrical publications . They are also in a real sense an intimate record . For the sea has often enough seemed to me almost as a vast external subconsciousness in which the forces of my being — as well as the world 's — were at play .</p>

   <head>SEA-HOARDINGS</head>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">My heart is open again and sea flows in ,</l>
     <l n="3">It shall fill with a summer of mists and winds and clouds and waves breaking ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of gull-wings over the green tide , of the surf 's drenching din ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of sudden horizon-sails that come and vanish , phantom-thin ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of arching sapphire skies , deep and unaching .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">I shall lie on the rocks just over the weeds that drape</l>
     <l n="8">The clear sea-pools , where birth and death in sunny ooze are teeming .</l>
     <l n="9">Where the crab in quest of booty sidles about , a sullen shape ,</l>
     <l n="10">Where the snail creeps and the mussel sleeps with wary valves agape ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where life is too grotesque to be but seeming .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">And the swallow shall weave my dreams with threads of flight ,</l>
     <l n="13">A shuttle with silver breast across the warp of the waves gliding ;</l>
     <l n="14">And an isle far out shall be a beam in the loom of my delight ,</l>
     <l n="15">And the pattern of every dream shall be a rapture bathed in light —</l>
     <l n="16">Its evanescence a beauty most abiding .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">And the sunsets shall give sadness all its due ,</l>
     <l n="18">They shall stain the sands and trouble the tides with all the ache of sorrow .</l>
     <l n="19">They shall bleed and die with a beauty of meaning old yet ever new ,</l>
     <l n="20">They shall burn with all the hunger for things that hearts have failed to do ,</l>
     <l n="21">They shall whisper of a gold that none can borrow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="22">And the stars shall come and build a bridge of fire</l>
     <l n="23">For the moon to cross the boundless sea , with never a fear of sinking .</l>
     <l n="24">They shall teach me of the magic things of life never to tire ,</l>
     <l n="25">And how to renew , when it is low , the lamp of my desire —</l>
     <l n="26">And how to hope , in the darkest deeps of thinking .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE SHORE 'S SONG TO THE SEA</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="27">Out on the rocks primeval ,</l>
     <l n="28">The grey Maine rocks that slant and break to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="29">With the bay and juniper round them ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the leagues on leagues before them ,</l>
     <l n="31">And the terns and gulls wheeling and crying , wheeling and crying over ,</l>
     <l n="32">I sat heart-still and listened .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="33">And first I could only hear the wind in my ears ,</l>
     <l n="34">And the foam trying to fill the high rock-shallows .</l>
     <l n="35">And then , over the wind , over the whitely blossoming foam ,</l>
     <l n="36">Low , low , like a lover 's song beginning ,</l>
     <l n="37">I heard the nuptial pleading of the old shore ,</l>
     <l n="38">A pleading ever occultly growing louder :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="39">O sea , glad bride of me !</l>
     <l n="40">Born of the bright ether and given to wed me ,</l>
     <l n="41">Given to glance , ever , for me , and gleam and dance in the sun —</l>
     <l n="42">Come to my arms , come to my reaching arms ,</l>
     <l n="43">That seem so still and unavailing to take you , and hold you ,</l>
     <l n="44">Yet never forget ,</l>
     <l n="45">Never by day or night ,</l>
     <l n="46">The hymeneal delights of your embracings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="47">Come , for the moon , my rival , shall not have you ;</l>
     <l n="48">No , for tho twice daily afar he beckons and you go ,</l>
     <l n="49">You , my bride , a little way back to meet him ,</l>
     <l n="50">As if he once had been your lover , he too , and again enspelled you ,</l>
     <l n="51">Soon , soon , I know it is only feigning !</l>
     <l n="52">For turning , playfully turning , tidally turning ,</l>
     <l n="53">You rush foamingly , swiftly back to my arms !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="54">And so would I have you rush ; so rush now !</l>
     <l n="55">Come from the sands where you have stayed too long ,</l>
     <l n="56">Come from the reefs where you have wandered silent ,</l>
     <l n="57">For ebbings are good , the restful ebbings of love ,</l>
     <l n="58">But , oh , the bridal flowings of it are better !</l>
     <l n="59">And now I would have you loose again my tresses ,</l>
     <l n="60">My locks rough and weedy , rough and brown and brinily tangled ,</l>
     <l n="61">But , oh , again as a bridegroom 's , when your tide , whispering in ,</l>
     <l n="62">Lifts them up , pulsingly up with kisses !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="63">Come with your veil thrown back , breaking to spray !</l>
     <l n="64">And oh , with plangent passion !</l>
     <l n="65">Come with your naked sweetness , salt and wholesome , to my bosom ;</l>
     <l n="66">Let not a cave or crevice of me miss you , or cranny ,</l>
     <l n="67">For , oh , the nuptial joy you float into me ,</l>
     <l n="68">The cooling ambient clasp of you , I have waited over-long ,</l>
     <l n="69">And I need to know again its marriage meaning !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="70">For I think it is not alone to bring forth life , that I mate you ;</l>
     <l n="71">More than life is the beauty of life with love !</l>
     <l n="72">Plentiful are the children that you bear to me , the blossoms ,</l>
     <l n="73">The fruits and all the creatures at your breast dewily fed ,</l>
     <l n="74">But mating is troubled with a far higher meaning —</l>
     <l n="75">A hint of a consummation for all things .</l>
     <l n="76">Come utterly then ,</l>
     <l n="77">Utterly to me come ,</l>
     <l n="78">And let us surge together , clasped close , in infinite union ,</l>
     <l n="79">Until we reach a transcendence of all birth , and all dying ,</l>
     <l n="80">An ecstasy holding the universe blended —</l>
     <l n="81">Such ecstasy as is its ultimate Aim !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="82">So sang the shore , the long bay-scented shore ,</l>
     <l n="83">Broken by many an isle , many an inlet bird-embosomed ,</l>
     <l n="84">And the sea gave answer , bridally , tidally turning ,</l>
     <l n="85">And leapt , radiant , into his rocky arms !</l>
    </lg>
    <p>TO A FIREFLY BY THE SEA</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="86">Little torch-bearer , alone with me in the night ,</l>
     <l n="87">You cannot light the sea , nor I illumine life .</l>
     <l n="88">They are too vast for us , they are too deep for us .</l>
     <l n="89">We glow with all our strength , but back the shadows sweep :</l>
     <l n="90">And after a while will come — unshadowed Sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="91">Here on the rocks that take the turning tide ;</l>
     <l n="92">Here by the wide lone waves and lonelier wastes of sky ,</l>
     <l n="93">We keep our poet-watch , as patient poets should ,</l>
     <l n="94">Questioning earth 's commingled ill and good to us .</l>
     <l n="95">Yet little of them , or naught , have truly understood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="96">Bright are the stars , and constellated thick .</l>
     <l n="97">To you , so quick to flit along your flickering course ,</l>
     <l n="98">They seem perhaps as glowing mates in other fields .</l>
     <l n="99">And all the knowledge I have gathered yields to me</l>
     <l n="100">Scarce more of the great mystery their wonder wields .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="101">For the moon we are waiting — and behold</l>
     <l n="102">Her ardent gold drifts up , her sail has caught the breeze</l>
     <l n="103">That blows all being thro the Universe always .</l>
     <l n="104">So now , little light-keeper , you no more need nurse</l>
     <l n="105">Your gleam , for lo ! she mounts , and sullen clouds disperse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="106">And I with aching thought may cease to burn ,</l>
     <l n="107">And humbly turn to rest — knowing no glow of mine</l>
     <l n="108">Can ever be so beauteous as have been to me</l>
     <l n="109">Your soft beams here beside the sea 's elusive din :</l>
     <l n="110">For grief too oft has kindled me , and pain , and the world 's sin .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>INVOCATION</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="111">( From a High Cliff )</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="112">Sweep unrest</l>
     <l n="113">Out of my blood ,</l>
     <l n="114">Winds of the sea ! Sweep the fog</l>
     <l n="115">Out of my brain</l>
     <l n="116">For I am one</l>
     <l n="117">Who has told Life he will be free .</l>

     <l n="119">Who will not fear the work to do ,</l>
     <l n="120">Who will hold peaks Promethean</l>
     <l n="121">Better than all Jove 's honey-dew .</l>
     <l n="122">Who when the Vulture tears his breast</l>
     <l n="123">Will smile into the Terror 's Eyes .</l>
     <l n="124">Who for the World has this Bequest —</l>
     <l n="125">Hope , that eternally is wise .</l>

    <p>I KNOW YOUR HEART , O SEA !</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="126">I know your heart , O Sea !</l>
     <l n="127">You are tossed with cold desire to flood earth utterly ;</l>
     <l n="128">You run at the cliffs , you fling wild billows at beaches ,</l>
     <l n="129">You reach at islands with fingers of foam to crumble them ;</l>
     <l n="130">Yes , even at mountain tops you shout your purpose</l>
     <l n="131">Of making the earth a shoreless circle of waters !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="132">I know your surging heart !</l>
     <l n="133">Tides mighty and all-contemptuous rise within it ,</l>
     <l n="134">Tides spurred by the wind to champ and charge and thunder —</l>
     <l n="135">Tho the sun and moon rein them —</l>
     <l n="136">At the troubling land , the breeding-place of mortals ,</l>
     <l n="137">Of men who are ever transmuting life to spirit ,</l>
     <l n="138">And ever taking your salt to savor their tears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="139">I know your tides , I know them !</l>
     <l n="140">“ Down , ” they rage , “ with the questing of men , and crying !</l>
     <l n="141">With their continents — cradles of grief and despair !</l>
     <l n="142">Better entombing waters for them , better our deeps unfathomed ,</l>
     <l n="143">Where birth is soulless , life goalless , death toll-less for all ,</l>
     <l n="144">And where dark ooze enshrouds past resurrection ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="145">Ah , yes , I know your heart !</l>
     <l n="146">I have heard it raving at coast-lights set to reveal you ,</l>
     <l n="147">I have watched it foam at ships that sought to defy you ,</l>
     <l n="148">I have seen it straining at cables that cross you , bearing whispers hid to you ,</l>
     <l n="149">Or heaving at waves of the air that tell your hurricanes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="150">I know , I know your heart !</l>
     <l n="151">Men you will sink , and shores will sink ; but a shore shall be man 's forever ,</l>
     <l n="152">From whence his lighthouse soul shall signal the Infinite ,</l>
     <l n="153">Whose fleets go by , star after star , bearing their unknown burden</l>
     <l n="154">To a Port which only eternity shall determine !</l>

    <p>A SEA-GHOST</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="155">Oh , fisher-fleet , go in from the sea</l>
     <l n="156">And furl your wings .</l>
     <l n="157">The bay is gray with the twilit spray</l>

     <l n="159">The chill buoy-bell is rung by the hands</l>

SHADOWY THRESHOLDS By CALE YOUNG RICE “ Cale Young Rice is far too great a pout to be acclaimed in some partisan circles .... He is intensely American ... as authentic an artist as Shelley or Keats .... He has the magic of Poe without that poet 's morbidity .... He is America 's living master-poet . ” — D. F. Hannigan ( The Rochester Post-Express ) . “ This volume maintains Mr. Rice 's usual high level and proves anew his right to one of the high places among modern poets . ” — Edward J. Wheeler ( Current Opinion ) . “ Mr. Rice is modern in the broadest sense of that term . Many of his poems are without rhyme and have irregular metres , but they never offend thereby .... His place in contemporary first class company is secure .— The Springfield Republican . “ A volume possessing range and variety , together with a lyric quality which distinguishes this poet , who ranks among the foremost American writers . ” — The Post-Intelligencer ( Seattle ) . “ Mr. Rice in his dramas is an enchanter , and to cast a spell is better than to have uttered the most lovely lyrics — but he has done both . ” — E. A. Jonas ( The Louisville Herald ) . “ A new volume showing again the power and beauty of Mr. Rice 's genius . ” — The Boston Globe . “ What a pleasure to take up a new book by Cale Young Rice . Here we have variety , if ever .... If one can only own one of his books this is a good volume to choose . ” — The Galveston News . “ Cale Young Rice is a poet capable of sounding the deep imaginative strain not only with melody , but with vigor and power of thought .
