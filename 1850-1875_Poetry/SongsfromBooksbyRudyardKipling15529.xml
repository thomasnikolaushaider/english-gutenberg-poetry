    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">I have collected in this volume practically all the verses and chapter-headings scattered through my books . In several cases where only a few lines of verse were originally used , I have given in full the song , etc ., from which they were taken .</p>
    <p n="2">RUDYARD KIPLING .</p>
    <p n="3">‘ CITIES AND THRONES AND POWERS ’</p>
    <p n="4">Cities and Thrones and Powers , Stand in Time 's eye , Almost as long as flowers , Which daily die . But , as new buds put forth To glad new men , Out of the spent and unconsidered Earth , The Cities rise again .</p>
    <p n="5">This season 's Daffodil , She never hears , What change , what chance , what chill , Cut down last year 's : But with bold countenance , And knowledge small , Esteems her seven days ’ continuance To be perpetual .</p>
    <p n="6">So Time that is o'erhYpppHeNkind , To all that be , Ordains us e'en as blind , As bold as she : That in our very death , And burial sure , Shadow to shadow , well persuaded , saith , ‘ See how our works endure ! ’</p>

     <item>For a season there must be pain , 200 For our white and our excellent nights — for the nights of swift running , 248 For the sake of him who showed , 56 From the wheel and the drift of Things , 202</item>
     <item>‘ Gold is for the mistress — silver for the maid ’ , 36 Go , stalk the red deer o'er the heather , 31</item>
     <item>Harry , our King in England , from London town is gone , 272 He drank strong waters and his speech was coarse , 35 Here come I to my own again , 151 Here we go in a flung festoon , 92 His spots are the joy of the Leopard : his horns are the Buffalo 's pride , 245 ‘ How far is St. Helena from a little child at play ? ’ , 66</item>
     <item>I am the land of their fathers , 1 I am the Most Wise Baviaan , saying in most wise tones , 184 I closed and drew for my love 's sake , 17 ‘ If I have taken the common clay ’ , 84 If I were hanged on the highest hill , 237 I followed my Duke ere I was a lover , 19 If Thought can reach to Heaven , 170 If you can keep your head when all about you , 149 If you wake at midnight , and hear a horse 's feet , 269 I have been given my charge to keep , 50 I keep six honest serving-men , 185 I know not in Whose hands are laid , 154 I met my mates in the morning ( and oh , but I am old ! ) , 161 I 'm just in love with all these three , 8 In the daytime , when she moved about me , 34 ‘ I see the grass shake in the sun for leagues on either hand ’ , 28 I tell this tale , which is strictly true , 266 It was not in the open fight , 33 I 've never sailed the Amazon , 188 I was very well pleased with what I knowed , 10 I will let loose against you the fleet-footed vines , 241 I will remember what I was , I am sick of rope and chain , 251</item>

     <item>Neither the harps nor the crowns amused , nor the cherubs ’ dove-winged races , 174 Not though you die to-night , O Sweet , and wail , 32 Not with an outcry to Allah nor any complaining , 71 Now Chil the Kite brings home the night , 245 Now it is not good for the Christian 's health to hustle the Aryan brown , 79 Now this is the Law of the Jungle — as old and as true as the sky , 120 Now we are come to our Kingdom , 15</item>
     <item>Of all the trees that grow so fair , 21 Oh ! hush thee , my baby , the night is behind us , 250 Oh , light was the world that he weighed in his hands !, 39 Oh , little did the Wolf-Child care , 243 Old Horn to All Atlantic said , 285</item>
     <item>‘ Old Mother Laidinwool had nigh twelve months been dead ’ , 179 Once a ripple came to land , 226 Once we feared The Beast — when he followed us we ran , 296 One man in a thousand , Solomon says , 62 One moment past our bodies cast , 223 Our Fathers in a wondrous age , 130 Our gloves are stiff with the frozen blood , 292 Our Lord Who did the Ox command , 41 Our sister sayeth such and such , 232 Over the edge of the purple down , 198</item>
     <item>Pit where the buffalo cooled his hide , 35 Prophets have honour all over the Earth , 111 Pussy can sit by the fire and sing , 190</item>
     <item>Queen Bess was Harry 's daughter . Stand forward partners all !, 193</item>
     <item>Ride with an idle whip , ride with an unused heel , 33 Rome never looks where she treads , 98 Roses red and roses white , 225</item>
     <item>See you the ferny ride that steals , 3 She dropped the bar , she shot the bolt , she fed the fire anew , 238 Shiv , who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow , 48 Shove off from the wharf-edge ! Steady !, 219 Singer and tailor am I , 299 So we settled it all when the storm was done , 83 ‘ Stopped in the straight when the race was his own ! ’ , 31 Strangers drawn from the ends of the earth , jewelled and plumed were we , 12</item>
     <item>Take of English earth as much , 26 Tell it to the locked-up trees , 24 The beasts are very wise , 143 The Camel 's hump is an ugly lump , 182 The Celt in all his variants from Builth to Ballyhoo , 73 The doors were wide , the story saith , 135 The gull shall whistle in his wake , the blind wave break in fire , 114 The lark will make her hymn to God , 84 The Law whereby my lady moves , 230 The night we felt the earth would move , 253 The People of the Eastern Ice , they are melting like the snow , 252 There are three degrees of bliss , 156 There is pleasure in the wet , wet clay , 81 There is sorrow enough in the natural way , 168 There runs a road by Merrow Down , 176 There 's a convict more in the Central Jail , 137 There 's no wind along these seas , 290 There was a strife ‘ twixt man and maid , 81 There was never a Queen like Balkis , 191 There were three friends that buried the fourth , 85 These are the Four that are never content , that have never been filled since the Dews began , 248 These were my companions going forth by night , 69 The Stranger within my gate , 100 The stream is shrunk — the pool is dry , 246 The torn boughs trailing o'er the tusks aslant , 133 The Weald is good , the Downs are best , 9 The wind took off with the sunset , 254 The wolf-cub at even lay hid in the corn , 84 The World hath set its heavy yoke , 32 They burnt a corpse upon the sand , 33 They killed a child to please the Gods , 132 They shut the road through the woods , 6 This I saw when the rites were done , 79 This is the mouth-filling song of the race that was run by a Boomer , 186 Three things make earth unquiet , 124 Thrones , Powers , Dominions , Peoples , Kings , 94 To-night , God knows what thing shall tide , 34 To the Heavens above us , 164</item>
     <item>Unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised , 136</item>
     <item>Valour and Innocence , 196 Veil them , cover them , wall them round , 247</item>
     <item>We be the Gods of the East , 82 We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules , 145 We meet in an evil land , 78 What is a woman that you forsake her , 60 What is the moral ? Who rides may read , 64 What of the hunting , hunter bold ?, 247 ‘ What 's that that hirples at my side ? ’ , 283 When a lover hies abroad , 81 When first by Eden Tree , 140 When I left home for Lalage 's sake , 102 When the cabin port-holes are dark and green , 182 When the drums begin to beat , 288 When the Earth was sick and the Skies were grey , 30 When the Great Ark , in Vigo Bay , 109 When the robust and Brass-bound Man commissioned first for sea , 263 When the water 's countenance , 277 When ye say to Tabaqui , ‘ My Brother ! ’ when ye call the Hyena to meat , 252 Where 's the lamp that Hero lit 157 Who gives him the Bath ? 54 Who knows the heart of the Christian ? How does he reason ? 75</item>
     <item>Yet at the last , ere our spearmen had found him 85 You must n't swim till you 're six weeks old 250 Your jar of Virginny 105 Your tiercel 's too long at hack , Sir . He 's no eyass 206</item>
     <item>THE RECALL</item>
     <item>I am the land of their fathers . In me the virtue stays . I will bring back my children , After certain days .</item>
     <item>Under their feet in the grasses My clinging magic runs . They shall return as strangers , They shall remain as sons .</item>
     <item>Over their heads in the branches Of their new-bought , ancient trees , I weave an incantation And draw them to my knees .</item>
     <item>Scent of smoke in the evening . Smell of rain in the night , The hours , the days and the seasons , Order their souls aright ;</item>
     <item>Till I make plain the meaning Of all my thousand years — Till I fill their hearts with knowledge . While I fill their eyes with tears .</item>
     <item>PUCK 'S SONG</item>
     <item>See you the ferny ride that steals Into the oak-woods far ? O that was whence they hewed the keels That rolled to Trafalgar .</item>
     <item>And mark you where the ivy clings To Bayham 's mouldering walls ? O there we cast the stout railings That stand around St. Paul 's .</item>
     <item>See you the dimpled track that runs All hollow through the wheat ? O that was where they hauled the guns That smote King Philip 's fleet .</item>
     <item>Out of the Weald , the secret Weald , Men sent in ancient years , The horse-shoes red at Flodden Field , The arrows at Poitiers .</item>
     <item>See you our little mill that clacks , So busy by the brook ? She has ground her corn and paid her tax Ever since Domesday Book .</item>
     <item>See you our stilly woods of oak ? And the dread ditch beside ? O that was where the Saxons broke On the day that Harold died .</item>
     <item>See you the windy levels spread About the gates of Rye ? O that was where the Northmen fled , When Alfred 's ships came by .</item>
     <item>See you our pastures wide and lone , Where the red oxen browse ? O there was a City thronged and known . Ere London boasted a house .</item>
     <item>And see you , after rain , the trace Of mound and ditch and wall ? O that was a Legion 's camping-place , When Cæsar sailed from Gaul .</item>
     <item>And see you marks that show and fade , Like shadows on the Downs ? O they are the lines the Flint Men made , To guard their wondrous towns .</item>
     <item>Trackway and Camp and City lost , Salt Marsh where now is corn ; Old Wars , old Peace , old Arts that cease , And so was England born !</item>
     <item>She is not any common Earth , Water or wood or air , But Merlin 's Isle of Gramarye , Where you and I will fare .</item>
     <item>THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS</item>
     <item>They shut the road through the woods Seventy years ago . Weather and rain have undone it again , And now you would never know There was once a road through the woods Before they planted the trees . It is underneath the coppice and heath , And the thin anemones . Only the keeper sees That , where the ring-dove broods . And the badgers roll at ease , There was once a road through the woods .</item>
     <item>Yet , if you enter the woods Of a summer evening late , When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools Where the otter whistles his mate . ( They fear not men in the woods . Because they see so few ) You will hear the beat of a horse 's feet , And the swish of a skirt in the dew , Steadily cantering through The misty solitudes , As though they perfectly knew The old lost road through the woods ... But there is no road through the woods !</item>
     <item>A THREE-PART SONG</item>
     <item>I 'm just in love with all these three , The Weald and the Marsh and the Down countrie ; Nor I do n't know which I love the most , The Weald or the Marsh or the white chalk coast !</item>
     <item>I 've buried my heart in a ferny hill , Twix ’ a liddle low shaw an ’ a great high gill . Oh hop-bine yaller an ’ wood-smoke blue , I reckon you 'll keep her middling true !</item>
     <item>I 've loosed my mind for to out and run On a Marsh that was old when Kings begun . Oh Romney Level and Brenzett reeds , I reckon you know what my mind needs !</item>
     <item>I 've given my soul to the Southdown grass , And sheep-bells tinkled where you pass . Oh Firle an ’ Ditchling an ’ sails at sea , I reckon you keep my soul for me !</item>
     <item>THE RUN OF THE DOWNS</item>
     <item>The Weald is good , the Downs are best — I 'll give you the run of ‘ em , East to West . Beachy Head and Winddoor Hill , They were once and they are still , Firle , Mount Caburn and Mount Harry Go back as far as sums 'll carry . Ditchling Beacon and Chanctonbury Ring , They have looked on many a thing , And what those two have missed between ‘ em I reckon Truleigh Hill has seen ‘ em . Highden , Bignor and Duncton Down Knew Old England before the Crown . Linch Down , Treyford and Sunwood Knew Old England before the Flood . And when you end on the Hampshire side — Butser 's old as Time and Tide . The Downs are sheep , the Weald is corn , You be glad you are Sussex born !</item>

      <head>THE KING 'S TASK</head>
       <l n="1">After the sack of the City , when Rome was sunk to a name ,</l>
       <l n="2">In the years that the lights were darkened , or ever St. Wilfrid came ,</l>
       <l n="3">Low on the borders of Britain ( the ancient poets sing )</l>
       <l n="4">Between the Cliff and the Forest there ruled a Saxon King .</l>
       <l n="5">Stubborn all were his people from cottar to overlord —</l>
       <l n="6">Not to be cowed by the cudgel , scarce to be schooled by the sword ;</l>
       <l n="7">Quick to turn at their pleasure , cruel to cross in their mood ,</l>
       <l n="8">And set on paths of their choosing as the hogs of Andred 's Wood .</l>
       <l n="9">Laws they made in the Witan — the laws of flaying and fine —</l>
       <l n="10">Common , loppage and pannage , the theft and the track of kine —</l>
       <l n="11">Statutes of tun and market for the fish and the malt and the meal —</l>
       <l n="12">The tax on the Bramber packhorse and the tax on the Hastings keel .</l>
       <l n="13">Over the graves of the Druids and under the wreck of Rome</l>
       <l n="14">Rudely but surely they bedded the plinth of the days to come .</l>
       <l n="15">Behind the feet of the Legions and before the Norseman 's ire ,</l>
       <l n="16">Rudely but greatly begat they the framing of state and shire .</l>
       <l n="17">Rudely but deeply they laboured , and their labour stands till now ,</l>
       <l n="18">If we trace on our ancient headlands the twist of their eight-ox plough .</l>
       <l n="19">There came a king from Hamtun , by Bosenham he came .</l>
       <l n="20">He filled Use with slaughter , and Lewes he gave to flame .</l>
       <l n="21">He smote while they sat in the Witan — sudden he smote and sore ,</l>
       <l n="22">That his fleet was gathered at Selsea ere they mustered at Cymen 's Ore .</l>
       <l n="23">Blithe went the Saxons to battle , by down and wood and mere ,</l>
       <l n="24">But thrice the acorns ripened ere the western mark was clear .</l>
       <l n="25">Thrice was the beechmast gathered , and the Beltane fires burned</l>
       <l n="26">Thrice , and the beeves were salted thrice ere the host returned .</l>
       <l n="27">They drove that king from Hamtun , by Bosenham o'erthrown ,</l>
       <l n="28">Out of Rugnor to Wilton they made his land their own .</l>
       <l n="29">Camps they builded at Gilling , at Basing and Alresford ,</l>
       <l n="30">But wrath abode in the Saxons from cottar to overlord .</l>
       <l n="31">Wrath at the weary war-game , at the foe that snapped and ran</l>
       <l n="32">Wolf-wise feigning and flying , and wolf-wise snatching his man .</l>
       <l n="33">Wrath for their spears unready , their levies new to the blades —</l>
       <l n="34">Shame for the helpless sieges and the scornful ambuscades .</l>
       <l n="35">At hearth and tavern and market , wherever the tale was told ,</l>
       <l n="36">Shame and wrath had the Saxons because of their boasts of old .</l>
       <l n="37">And some would drink and deny it , and some would pray and atone ;</l>
       <l n="38">But the most part , after their anger , avouched that the sin was their own .</l>
       <l n="39">Wherefore , girding together , up to the Witan they came ,</l>
       <l n="40">And as they had shouldered their bucklers so did they shoulder their blame .</l>
       <l n="41">For that was the wont of the Saxons ( the ancient poets sing ) ,</l>
       <l n="42">And first they spoke in the Witan and then they spoke to the King :</l>
       <l n="43">‘ Edward King of the Saxons , thou knowest from sire to son ,</l>
       <l n="44">‘ One is the King and his People — in gain and ungain one .</l>
       <l n="45">‘ Count we the gain together . With doubtings and spread dismays</l>
       <l n="46">‘ We have broken a foolish people — but after many days .</l>
       <l n="47">‘ Count we the loss together . Warlocks hampered our arms ,</l>
       <l n="48">‘ We were tricked as by magic , we were turned as by charms .</l>
       <l n="49">‘ We went down to the battle and the road was plain to keep ,</l>
       <l n="50">‘ But our angry eyes were holden , and we struck as they strike in sleep —</l>
       <l n="51">‘ Men new shaken from slumber , sweating , with eyes a-stare</l>
       <l n="52">‘ Little blows uncertain dealt on the useless air .</l>
       <l n="53">‘ Also a vision betrayed us , and a lying tale made bold</l>
       <l n="54">‘ That we looked to hold what we had not and to have what we did not hold :</l>
       <l n="55">‘ That a shield should give us shelter — that a sword should give us power —</l>
       <l n="56">‘ A shield snatched up at a venture and a hilt scarce handled an hour :</l>
       <l n="57">‘ That being rich in the open , we should be strong in the close —</l>
       <l n="58">‘ And the Gods would sell us a cunning for the day that we met our foes .</l>
       <l n="59">‘ This was the work of wizards , but not with our foe they bide ,</l>
       <l n="60">‘ In our own camp we took them , and their names are Sloth and Pride .</l>
       <l n="61">‘ Our pride was before the battle : our sloth ere we lifted spear ,</l>
       <l n="62">‘ But hid in the heart of the people as the fever hides in the mere ,</l>
       <l n="63">‘ Waiting only the war-game , the heat of the strife to rise</l>
       <l n="64">‘ As the ague fumes round Oxeney when the rotting reed-bed dries .</l>
       <l n="65">‘ But now we are purged of that fever — cleansed by the letting of blood ,</l>
       <l n="66">‘ Something leaner of body — something keener of mood .</l>
       <l n="67">‘ And the men new-freed from the levies return to the fields again ,</l>
       <l n="68">‘ Matching a hundred battles , cottar and lord and thane .</l>
       <l n="69">‘ And they talk aloud in the temples where the ancient wargods are .</l>
       <l n="70">‘ They thumb and mock and belittle the holy harness of war .</l>
       <l n="71">‘ They jest at the sacred chariots , the robes and the gilded staff .</l>
       <l n="72">‘ These things fill them with laughter , they lean on their spears and laugh .</l>
       <l n="73">‘ The men grown old in the war-game , hither and thither they range —</l>
       <l n="74">‘ And scorn and laughter together are sire and dam of change ;</l>
       <l n="75">‘ And change may be good or evil — but we know not what it will bring ,</l>
       <l n="76">‘ Therefore our King must teach us . That is thy task , O King ! ’</l>
