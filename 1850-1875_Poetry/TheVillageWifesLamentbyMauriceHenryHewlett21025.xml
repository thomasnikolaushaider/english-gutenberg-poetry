    <p n="1">This poem is dramatic , and I am not to be supposed answerable for all that it expresses ; nevertheless I think that my own convictions about aggressive war are very much those of my Village Wife . Of defensive war , of war to save the lives of our children , of war to save humanity itself , there cannot be two sane opinions : that is a pious duty forced upon us ; but it becomes every day more inconceivable to me how men can engage in the other kind of war , and how , in particular , a people so provident as the German people could have hoodwinked themselves into believing that they could be better off by such a monstrous means as warfare has now become . They had behind them the experience of the Russians and Japanese ; they had all about them the evidences of their forty years ’ commercial activity ; they must have known , or at least their governors must have known , what kind of results might be looked for from modern armament — and yet they dared risk the dereliction of human morality , the cutting off of a generation of men , and their own national bankruptcy . Whether it was the madness of lust , or of pride , or of fear , it was a madness which has procured the greatest disaster of recorded time , and revealed a criminal folly in themselves which it will take more than two generations to efface . Indeed , German blood-lust will become one of the standing legends of History .</p>
    <p n="2">The Village Wife knows nothing of the Germans , however , and her reproaches strike at the heart of Mankind . So long as Mankind looks upon aggressive war as a reasonable , if ultimate , appeal , her reproaches will have force , and be deserved . They , or something like them ( with the sanction of inspiration upon them ) will , I believe , be the means of our redemption . As human nature still actually is , no League of Nations conceivable to us will be able to save us from war . Rend your hearts and not your armaments . Let us learn to look War in the face , and while the blood is cold , so that we may know what we are meaning to do . Let us put a moral taboo upon it , such as we have put upon parricide , or incest , or cannibalism . For certain , in those matters , the reason has put a sanction on the conscience . So will it in the matter of aggressive war . Side by side with that , as we now see , we must change the governance of nations . If those who do a nation 's work are given their due share of that nation 's government , war I firmly believe , will become a dark memory , a blotted cloud upon a past age . “ Hundreds of years ago , ” it will one day be said to some wondering child , “ men hired men to murder each other for the sake of their religion or their commerce . This they had done for thousands of years until at last , in the most dreadful of their wars , they killed or maimed a whole generation in the space of about four years . Then it was that men saw what they had been doing , and for a while the world was shamed , silent . That time of silence was long enough to turn the hearts of men . ”</p>
    <p n="3">I have put into the mouth of my Village Wife thoughts which she may never have formulated , but which , I am very sure , lie in her heart , too deep for any utterance but that of tears . If I know anything of village people I know this , that they shape their lives according to Nature , and are outraged to the root of their being by the frustration of Nature 's laws and the stultification of man 's function in the scheme of things . What the function of man is , what the power , what the dignity have been well paraphrased in these words :</p>
    <p n="4">“ ‘ Neither a fixed abode , nor a form in thine own likeness , nor any gift peculiar to thyself alone , have we given thee , O Adam , in order that what abode , what likeness , what gifts thou shalt choose may be thine to have and to possess . The nature allotted to all other creatures , within laws appointed by ourselves , restrains them . Thou , restrained by no narrow bounds , according to thy own free will , in whose power we have placed thee , shalt define thy nature for thyself . We have set thee midmost the world , that thence thou mightest more conveniently survey whatsoever is in the world . Nor have we made thee either heavenly or earthly , mortal or immortal , to the end that thou , being , as it were , thy own free maker and moulder , shouldst fashion thyself in what form may like thee best . Thou shalt have power to decline unto the lower or brute creatures . Thou shalt have power to be reborn unto the higher or divine , according to the sentence of thy intellect . ’ Thus to Man , at his birth , the Father gave seeds of all variety and germs of every form of life . ”</p>
    <p n="5">That is near enough to the Nature of Man for present purposes .</p>
    <p n="6">“ Teach us man 's worth , that we may know it , Who , being alone in power to lift Above his nature , sinks below it ! ”</p>
