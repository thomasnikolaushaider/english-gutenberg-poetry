I do n't know for certain that the devil has split hoofs and a forked tail and carries a four-tined fork along with him in the hope of finding a hay-field handy ; but rather than make a private appointment with him to find out , I am willing to take the word of the picture books on the subject . ”</p>
   <p>Whatever weaknesses he may have , the man who is so thick-skinned that he can go on about his regular business and pay no attention to the little distractions of this life , has a great advantage in the world .

   <p>He was a four year old Oklahoma Fountleroy , in knee pants , and with golden curls that would make an angel envious . His face still wore the divine beauty of the cradle , and his large , luminous eyes reflected an innocence unspotted of the world .</p>
   <p>But the carpenter on the building did not appreciate his company . He was always in the way . So the carpenter thought he would frighten him away , by a story of horrible danger .</p>
   <p>“ Do you see that big man coming there ? ” said the carpenter to him .</p>
   <p>The child nodded assent .</p>
   <p>“ Well , ” continued the carpenter ; “ you would better run away before he gets you . That big man eats a boy for breakfast every morning , and he may eat you . ”</p>
   <p>A look of ineffable scorn slowly penetrated beneath the curls . The large , innocent eyes took on an expression of supreme contempt . Then the angel indifferently said :</p>
   <p>“ I ate a boy once ; he was a nigger ! ”</p>

   <p>A drummer is known by the stories he tells .</p>
   <p>Do n't be in a hurry to do a mean thing . You 'll have plenty of time to get sorry if you put it off until day after tomorrow .</p>
   <p>When a man stops to count the cost of a noble deed , temptation has already stormed and captured the fortifications of his honor .</p>
   <p>The $ 1 bill is a very popular brand among the people , but if history makes no mistake , it takes the $ 1 , 000 bill to secure votes in the Missouri legislature .</p>

   <p>“ I notice , ” said Uncle Ezra Mudge , “ Thet the self-made man is always kept so busy tellin ’ about the fine job of work he turned out , thet he never has time to get the roof on an ’ the doors an ’ winders hung . A self-made feller generally shows a rough job put together with dull tools an ’ in mighty poor taste when you git to lookin ’ at it real clost , an ’ it could be mightily improved on by a middlin ’ sight of polishin ’ , wood-filler an ’ hard-oil , well rubbed in ! ”</p>

   <p>Life 's experiences are very much the same as when we go fishing . The biggest fish always gets away . But even then we have a pretty good feast on the minnows .</p>
   <p>Yesterday is life 's departed king ; tomorrow holds all the possibilities of clown and emperor . Only today wears the glittering crown and the purple robes of power .</p>

It takes mighty leetle money ter make a man happy thet loves his work , en all the millions they kin pile up in front of him would n't buy a single beller from ole Lead on a hot trail ! Come on , Lead ! ” And the old man strode away through the clearing with all a boy 's enthusiasm for the hunt .</p>

   <p>“ With all your talk about necessary house-hold implements , ” said Sooner Dave , “ none of ‘ em is in it with the frying pan ,— just the common , ordinary , every-day frying pan , that you chuck under your buck-board or tie to your saddle-horn . These parlor ornaments , side-boards , new-fangled stoves , potato-mashers , coffee-strainers and all the everlasting tribe of culinary jim-cracks have to turn out of the trail for the frying pan and give it the right of way .</p>
   <p>“ With the frying pan for his companion , the civilized idiot is at home any where ,— prairie or woods , creek bank or deer-lick or prairie-chicken trysting place . With a frying pan and some bacon fat , home is never far away , and a full meal is so near that heaven comes close to the hungry man . It has fought more battles , made more forced marches and won more victories than Napoleon . It has surveyed lands , bunched cattle and soonered claims . It has done all the pioneering for the frontiers-man . In this one divine utensil , the wanderer fries his meat , bakes his flap-jacks and brews his coffee ; and as they all come steaming from its exalted circumference of life-sustaining food , what chafing-dish or modern steam-cooker was ever waited on by such a willing appetite ?</p>
   <p>“ When I die , ” continued Sooner Dave , “ I want a frying pan chiseled on my tomb-stone ; for it has been the sole companion of the truest happiness I have known in this world . And if over in the next world there is a chance to choose one 's crown after the style and finish the wearer may desire , I am going to take my faithful old frying pan along and wear it for a few thousand years just to show the angels how much a man can appreciate good things ! ”</p>

Only my old army friend in Kentucky knows me well enough to know what I can use . ”</p>

   <p>With all the strife and struggle after riches , the greatest joys of life are forever more the gifts of nature , within the reach of rich and poor alike , and beyond the measurings of gold . The clear sky and the green grass , the sunshine of the noon , and the dew of the morning , the blossom and the bird-song , good health and sound sleep , and the love of a man for a woman and of a woman for a man ,— these have no prices in the catalogues of wealth and poverty alike .</p>
