      <head>I .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">He was a Grecian lad , who coming home</l>
       <l n="2">With pulpy figs and wine from Sicily</l>
       <l n="3">Stood at his galley 's prow , and let the foam</l>
       <l n="4">Blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously ,</l>
       <l n="5">And holding wave and wind in boy 's despite</l>
       <l n="6">Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Till with the dawn he saw a burnished spear</l>
       <l n="8">Like a thin thread of gold against the sky ,</l>
       <l n="9">And hoisted sail , and strained the creaking gear ,</l>
       <l n="10">And bade the pilot head her lustily</l>
       <l n="11">Against the nor'west gale , and all day long</l>
       <l n="12">Held on his way , and marked the rowers ’ time with measured song .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">And when the faint Corinthian hills were red</l>
       <l n="14">Dropped anchor in a little sandy bay ,</l>
       <l n="15">And with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head ,</l>
       <l n="16">And brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray ,</l>
       <l n="17">And washed his limbs with oil , and from the hold</l>
       <l n="18">Brought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">And a rich robe stained with the fishers ’ juice</l>
       <l n="20">Which of some swarthy trader he had bought</l>
       <l n="21">Upon the sunny quay at Syracuse ,</l>
       <l n="22">And was with Tyrian broideries inwrought ,</l>
       <l n="23">And by the questioning merchants made his way</l>
       <l n="24">Up through the soft and silver woods , and when the labouring day</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">Had spun its tangled web of crimson cloud ,</l>
       <l n="26">Clomb the high hill , and with swift silent feet</l>
       <l n="27">Crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd</l>
       <l n="28">Of busy priests , and from some dark retreat</l>
       <l n="29">Watched the young swains his frolic playmates bring</l>
       <l n="30">The firstling of their little flock , and the shy shepherd fling</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">The crackling salt upon the flame , or hang</l>
       <l n="32">His studded crook against the temple wall</l>
       <l n="33">To Her who keeps away the ravenous fang</l>
       <l n="34">Of the base wolf from homestead and from stall ;</l>
       <l n="35">And then the clear-voiced maidens ‘ gan to sing ,</l>
       <l n="36">And to the altar each man brought some goodly offering ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">A beechen cup brimming with milky foam ,</l>
       <l n="38">A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery</l>
       <l n="39">Of hounds in chase , a waxen honey-comb</l>
       <l n="40">Dripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee</l>
       <l n="41">Had ceased from building , a black skin of oil</l>
       <l n="42">Meet for the wrestlers , a great boar the fierce and white-tusked</l>
       <l n="43">spoil</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="44">Stolen from Artemis that jealous maid</l>
       <l n="45">To please Athena , and the dappled hide</l>
       <l n="46">Of a tall stag who in some mountain glade</l>
       <l n="47">Had met the shaft ; and then the herald cried ,</l>
       <l n="48">And from the pillared precinct one by one</l>
       <l n="49">Went the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had</l>
       <l n="50">done .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="51">And the old priest put out the waning fires</l>
       <l n="52">Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed</l>
       <l n="53">For ever in the cell , and the shrill lyres</l>
       <l n="54">Came fainter on the wind , as down the road</l>
       <l n="55">In joyous dance these country folk did pass ,</l>
       <l n="56">And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="57">Long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe ,</l>
       <l n="58">And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine ,</l>
       <l n="59">And the rose-petals falling from the wreath</l>
       <l n="60">As the night breezes wandered through the shrine ,</l>
       <l n="61">And seemed to be in some entranced swoon</l>
       <l n="62">Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="63">Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor ,</l>
       <l n="64">When from his nook up leapt the venturous lad ,</l>
       <l n="65">And flinging wide the cedar-carven door</l>
       <l n="66">Beheld an awful image saffron-clad</l>
       <l n="67">And armed for battle ! the gaunt Griffin glared</l>
       <l n="68">From the huge helm , and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="69">Like a red rod of flame , stony and steeled</l>
       <l n="70">The Gorgon 's head its leaden eyeballs rolled ,</l>
       <l n="71">And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield ,</l>
       <l n="72">And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold</l>
       <l n="73">In passion impotent , while with blind gaze</l>
       <l n="74">The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="75">The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp</l>
       <l n="76">Far out at sea off Sunium , or cast</l>
       <l n="77">The net for tunnies , heard a brazen tramp</l>
       <l n="78">Of horses smite the waves , and a wild blast</l>
       <l n="79">Divide the folded curtains of the night ,</l>
       <l n="80">And knelt upon the little poop , and prayed in holy fright .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="81">And guilty lovers in their venery</l>
       <l n="82">Forgat a little while their stolen sweets ,</l>
       <l n="83">Deeming they heard dread Dian 's bitter cry ;</l>
       <l n="84">And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats</l>
       <l n="85">Ran to their shields in haste precipitate ,</l>
       <l n="86">Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="87">For round the temple rolled the clang of arms ,</l>
       <l n="88">And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear ,</l>
       <l n="89">And the air quaked with dissonant alarums</l>
       <l n="90">Till huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear ,</l>
       <l n="91">And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed ,</l>
       <l n="92">And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="93">Ready for death with parted lips he stood ,</l>
       <l n="94">And well content at such a price to see</l>
       <l n="95">That calm wide brow , that terrible maidenhood ,</l>
       <l n="96">The marvel of that pitiless chastity ,</l>
       <l n="97">Ah ! well content indeed , for never wight</l>
       <l n="98">Since Troy 's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="99">Ready for death he stood , but lo ! the air</l>
       <l n="100">Grew silent , and the horses ceased to neigh ,</l>
       <l n="101">And off his brow he tossed the clustering hair ,</l>
       <l n="102">And from his limbs he throw the cloak away ;</l>
       <l n="103">For whom would not such love make desperate ?</l>
       <l n="104">And nigher came , and touched her throat , and with hands violate</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="105">Undid the cuirass , and the crocus gown ,</l>
       <l n="106">And bared the breasts of polished ivory ,</l>
       <l n="107">Till from the waist the peplos falling down</l>
       <l n="108">Left visible the secret mystery</l>
       <l n="109">Which to no lover will Athena show ,</l>
       <l n="110">The grand cool flanks , the crescent thighs , the bossy hills of</l>
       <l n="111">snow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="112">Those who have never known a lover 's sin</l>
       <l n="113">Let them not read my ditty , it will be</l>
       <l n="114">To their dull ears so musicless and thin</l>
       <l n="115">That they will have no joy of it , but ye</l>
       <l n="116">To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile ,</l>
       <l n="117">Ye who have learned who Eros is , -  O listen yet awhile .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="118">A little space he let his greedy eyes</l>
       <l n="119">Rest on the burnished image , till mere sight</l>
       <l n="120">Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries ,</l>
       <l n="121">And then his lips in hungering delight</l>
       <l n="122">Fed on her lips , and round the towered neck</l>
       <l n="123">He flung his arms , nor cared at all his passion 's will to check .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="124">Never I ween did lover hold such tryst ,</l>
       <l n="125">For all night long he murmured honeyed word ,</l>
       <l n="126">And saw her sweet unravished limbs , and kissed</l>
       <l n="127">Her pale and argent body undisturbed ,</l>
       <l n="128">And paddled with the polished throat , and pressed</l>
       <l n="129">His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="130">It was as if Numidian javelins</l>
       <l n="131">Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain ,</l>
       <l n="132">And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins</l>
       <l n="133">In exquisite pulsation , and the pain</l>
       <l n="134">Was such sweet anguish that he never drew</l>
       <l n="135">His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="136">They who have never seen the daylight peer</l>
       <l n="137">Into a darkened room , and drawn the curtain ,</l>
       <l n="138">And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear</l>
       <l n="139">And worshipped body risen , they for certain</l>
       <l n="140">Will never know of what I try to sing ,</l>
       <l n="141">How long the last kiss was , how fond and late his lingering .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="24">
       <l n="142">The moon was girdled with a crystal rim ,</l>
       <l n="143">The sign which shipmen say is ominous</l>
       <l n="144">Of wrath in heaven , the wan stars were dim ,</l>
       <l n="145">And the low lightening east was tremulous</l>
       <l n="146">With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn ,</l>
       <l n="147">Ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="25">
       <l n="148">Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast</l>
       <l n="149">Clomb the brave lad , and reached the cave of Pan ,</l>
       <l n="150">And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed ,</l>
       <l n="151">And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran</l>
       <l n="152">Like a young fawn unto an olive wood</l>
       <l n="153">Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="26">
       <l n="154">And sought a little stream , which well he knew ,</l>
       <l n="155">For oftentimes with boyish careless shout</l>
       <l n="156">The green and crested grebe he would pursue ,</l>
       <l n="157">Or snare in woven net the silver trout ,</l>
       <l n="158">And down amid the startled reeds he lay</l>
       <l n="159">Panting in breathless sweet affright , and waited for the day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="27">
       <l n="160">On the green bank he lay , and let one hand</l>
       <l n="161">Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly ,</l>
       <l n="162">And soon the breath of morning came and fanned</l>
       <l n="163">His hot flushed cheeks , or lifted wantonly</l>
       <l n="164">The tangled curls from off his forehead , while</l>
       <l n="165">He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="28">
       <l n="166">And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak</l>
       <l n="167">With his long crook undid the wattled cotes ,</l>
       <l n="168">And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke</l>
       <l n="169">Curled through the air across the ripening oats ,</l>
       <l n="170">And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed</l>
       <l n="171">As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="29">
       <l n="172">And when the light-foot mower went afield</l>
       <l n="173">Across the meadows laced with threaded dew ,</l>
       <l n="174">And the sheep bleated on the misty weald ,</l>
       <l n="175">And from its nest the waking corncrake flew ,</l>
       <l n="176">Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream</l>
       <l n="177">And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="30">
       <l n="178">Nor deemed him born of mortals , and one said ,</l>
       <l n="179">‘ It is young Hylas , that false runaway</l>
       <l n="180">Who with a Naiad now would make his bed</l>
       <l n="181">Forgetting Herakles , ’ but others , ‘ Nay ,</l>
       <l n="182">It is Narcissus , his own paramour ,</l>
       <l n="183">Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="31">
       <l n="184">And when they nearer came a third one cried ,</l>
       <l n="185">‘ It is young Dionysos who has hid</l>
       <l n="186">His spear and fawnskin by the river side</l>
       <l n="187">Weary of hunting with the Bassarid ,</l>
       <l n="188">And wise indeed were we away to fly :</l>
       <l n="189">They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="32">
       <l n="190">So turned they back , and feared to look behind ,</l>
       <l n="191">And told the timid swain how they had seen</l>
       <l n="192">Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined ,</l>
       <l n="193">And no man dared to cross the open green ,</l>
       <l n="194">And on that day no olive-tree was slain ,</l>
       <l n="195">Nor rushes cut , but all deserted was the fair domain ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="33">
       <l n="196">Save when the neat-herd 's lad , his empty pail</l>
       <l n="197">Well slung upon his back , with leap and bound</l>
       <l n="198">Raced on the other side , and stopped to hail ,</l>
       <l n="199">Hoping that he some comrade new had found ,</l>
       <l n="200">And gat no answer , and then half afraid</l>
       <l n="201">Passed on his simple way , or down the still and silent glade</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="34">
       <l n="202">A little girl ran laughing from the farm ,</l>
       <l n="203">Not thinking of love 's secret mysteries ,</l>
       <l n="204">And when she saw the white and gleaming arm</l>
       <l n="205">And all his manlihood , with longing eyes</l>
