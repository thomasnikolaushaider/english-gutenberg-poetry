   <p>The Abbot for a walk went out , A wealthy cleric , very stout , And Robin has that Abbot stuck As the red hunter spears the buck . The djavel or the javelin Has , you observe , gone bravely in , And you may hear that weapon whack Bang through the middle of his back . HENCE WE MAY LEARN THAT ABBOTS SHOULD NEVER GO WALKING IN A WOOD .</p>
   <p>Poem : IV</p>
   <p>The frozen peaks he once explored , But now he 's dead and by the board . How better far at home to have stayed Attended by the parlour maid , And warmed his knees before the fire Until the hour when folks retire ! SO , IF YOU WOULD BE SPARED TO FRIENDS , DO NOTHING BUT FOR BUSINESS ENDS .</p>
   <p>Poem : V</p>
   <p>Industrious pirate ! see him sweep The lonely bosom of the deep , And daily the horizon scan From Hatteras or Matapan . Be sure , before that pirate 's old , He will have made a pot of gold , And will retire from all his labours And be respected by his neighbours . YOU ALSO SCAN YOUR LIFE 'S HORIZON FOR ALL THAT YOU CAN CLAP YOUR EYES ON .</p>

     <l n="85">And the edacious years continued .</l>
     <l n="86">Thrones rose and fell ; and still the crescent ,</l>
     <l n="87">Unsanative and now senescent ,</l>
     <l n="88">A plastered skeleton of lath ,</l>
     <l n="89">Looked forward to a day of wrath .</l>
     <l n="90">In the dead night , the groaning timber</l>
     <l n="91">Would jar upon the ear of slumber ,</l>
     <l n="92">And , like Dodona 's talking oak ,</l>
     <l n="93">Of oracles and judgments spoke .</l>
     <l n="94">When to the music fingered well</l>
     <l n="95">The feet of children lightly fell ,</l>
     <l n="96">The sire , who dozed by the decanters ,</l>
     <l n="97">Started , and dreamed of misadventures .</l>
     <l n="98">The rotten brick decayed to dust ;</l>
     <l n="99">The iron was consumed by rust ;</l>
     <l n="100">Each tabid and perverted mansion</l>
     <l n="101">Hung in the article of declension .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="102">So forty , fifty , sixty passed ;</l>
     <l n="103">Until , when seventy came at last ,</l>
     <l n="104">The occupant of number three</l>
     <l n="105">Called friends to hold a jubilee .</l>
     <l n="106">Wild was the night ; the charging rack</l>
     <l n="107">Had forced the moon upon her back ;</l>
     <l n="108">The wind piped up a naval ditty ;</l>
     <l n="109">And the lamps winked through all the city .</l>
     <l n="110">Before that house , where lights were shining ,</l>
     <l n="111">Corpulent feeders , grossly dining ,</l>
     <l n="112">And jolly clamour , hum and rattle ,</l>
     <l n="113">Fairly outvoiced the tempest 's battle .</l>
     <l n="114">As still his moistened lip he fingered ,</l>
     <l n="115">The envious policeman lingered ;</l>
     <l n="116">While far the infernal tempest sped ,</l>
     <l n="117">And shook the country folks in bed ,</l>
     <l n="118">And tore the trees and tossed the ships ,</l>
     <l n="119">He lingered and he licked his lips .</l>
     <l n="120">Lo , from within , a hush ! the host</l>
     <l n="121">Briefly expressed the evening 's toast ;</l>
     <l n="122">And lo , before the lips were dry ,</l>
     <l n="123">The Deacon rising to reply !</l>
     <l n="124">‘ Here in this house which once I built ,</l>
     <l n="125">Papered and painted , carved and gilt ,</l>
     <l n="126">And out of which , to my content ,</l>
     <l n="127">I netted seventy-five per cent . ;</l>
     <l n="128">Here at this board of jolly neighbours ,</l>
     <l n="129">I reap the credit of my labours .</l>
     <l n="130">These were the days — I will say more -</l>
     <l n="131">These were the grand old days of yore !</l>
     <l n="132">The builder laboured day and night ;</l>
     <l n="133">He watched that every brick was right :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="134">The decent men their utmost did ;</l>
     <l n="135">And the house rose — a pyramid !</l>
     <l n="136">These were the days , our provost knows ,</l>
     <l n="137">When forty streets and crescents rose ,</l>
     <l n="138">The fruits of my creative noddle ,</l>
     <l n="139">All more or less upon a model ,</l>
     <l n="140">Neat and commodious , cheap and dry ,</l>
     <l n="141">A perfect pleasure to the eye !</l>
     <l n="142">I found this quite a country quarter ;</l>
     <l n="143">I leave it solid lath and mortar .</l>
     <l n="144">In all , I was the single actor -</l>
     <l n="145">And am this city 's benefactor !</l>
     <l n="146">Since then , alas ! both thing and name ,</l>
     <l n="147">Shoddy across the ocean came -</l>
     <l n="148">Shoddy that can the eye bewilder</l>
     <l n="149">And makes me blush to meet a builder !</l>
     <l n="150">Had this good house , in frame or fixture ,</l>
     <l n="151">Been tempered by the least admixture</l>
     <l n="152">Of that discreditable shoddy ,</l>
     <l n="153">Should we to-day compound our toddy ,</l>
     <l n="154">Or gaily marry song and laughter</l>
     <l n="155">Below its sempiternal rafter ?</l>
     <l n="156">Not so ! ’ the Deacon cried .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="157">The mansion</l>
     <l n="158">Had marked his fatuous expansion .</l>
     <l n="159">The years were full , the house was fated ,</l>
     <l n="160">The rotten structure crepitated !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="161">A moment , and the silent guests</l>
     <l n="162">Sat pallid as their dinner vests .</l>
     <l n="163">A moment more and , root and branch ,</l>
     <l n="164">That mansion fell in avalanche ,</l>
     <l n="165">Story on story , floor on floor ,</l>
     <l n="166">Roof , wall and window , joist and door ,</l>
     <l n="167">Dead weight of damnable disaster ,</l>
     <l n="168">A cataclysm of lath and plaster .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="169">SILOAM DID NOT CHOOSE A SINNER -</l>
     <l n="170">ALL WERE NOT BUILDERS AT THE DINNER .</l>
