   <p>My life when young was like a flower — a flower that loosens a petal or two from her abundance and never feels the loss when the spring breeze comes to beg at her door .</p>
   <p>Now at the end of youth my life is like a fruit , having nothing to spare , and waiting to offer herself completely with her full burden of sweetness .</p>

   <p>In desperate joy I run upon the dusty path of the despised ; I draw near to your final welcome .</p>
   <p>The child finds its mother when it leaves her womb .</p>
   <p>When I am parted from you , thrown out from your household , I am free to see your face .</p>

   <p>Govinda , the great Sikh teacher , sat on the rock reading scriptures , when Raghunath , his disciple , proud of his wealth , came and bowed to him and said , “ I have brought my poor present unworthy of your acceptance . ”</p>
   <p>Thus saying he displayed before the teacher a pair of gold bangles wrought with costly stones .</p>
   <p>The master took up one of them , twirling it round his finger , and the diamonds darted shafts of light .</p>
   <p>Suddenly it slipped from his hand and rolled down the bank into the water .</p>
   <p>“ Alas , ” screamed Raghunath , and jumped into the stream .</p>
   <p>The teacher set his eyes upon his book , and the water held and hid what it stole and went its way .</p>
   <p>The daylight faded when Raghunath came back to the teacher tired and dripping .</p>
   <p>He panted and said , “ I can still get it back if you show me where it fell . ”</p>
   <p>The teacher took up the remaining bangle and throwing it into the water said , “ It is there . ”</p>

   <p>Sudâs , the gardener , plucked from his tank the last lotus left by the ravage of winter and went to sell it to the king at the palace gate .</p>
   <p>There he met a traveller who said to him , “ Ask your price for the last lotus ,— I shall offer it to Lord Buddha . ”</p>
   <p>Sudâs said , “ If you pay one golden mâshâ it will be yours . ”</p>
   <p>The traveller paid it .</p>
   <p>At that moment the king came out and he wished to buy the flower , for he was on his way to see Lord Buddha , and he thought , “ It would be a fine thing to lay at his feet the lotus that bloomed in winter . ”</p>
   <p>When the gardener said he had been offered a golden mâshâ the king offered him ten , but the traveller doubled the price .</p>
   <p>The gardener , being greedy , imagined a greater gain from him for whose sake they were bidding . He bowed and said , “ I cannot sell this lotus . ”</p>
   <p>In the hushed shade of the mango grove beyond the city wall Sudâs stood before Lord Buddha , on whose lips sat the silence of love and whose eyes beamed peace like the morning star of the dew-washed autumn .</p>
   <p>Sudâs looked in his face and put the lotus at his feet and bowed his head to the dust .</p>
   <p>Buddha smiled and asked , “ What is your wish , my son ? ”</p>
   <p>Sudâs cried , “ The least touch of your feet . ”</p>

   <p>I shall but play with it as the whim takes me ,— now take it on my lap , now touch it with my lips , now keep it by my side on the grass .</p>
   <p>But in the solemn evening stillness I shall gather flowers , to deck it with wreaths , I shall fill it with fragrance ; I shall worship it with the lighted lamp .</p>
   <p>Then at night I shall come to you and give you back your flute .</p>
   <p>You will play on it the music of midnight when the lonely crescent moon wanders among the stars .</p>

   <p>What is the quest that makes his boat care not for storm nor darkness ?</p>
   <p>Is it heavy with gems and pearls ?</p>
   <p>Ah , no , the Boatman brings with him no treasure , but only a white rose in his hand and a song on his lips .</p>
   <p>It is for her who watches alone at night with her lamp burning .</p>
   <p>She dwells in the wayside hut . Her loose hair flies in the wind and hides her eyes .</p>
   <p>The storm shrieks through her broken doors , the light flickers in her earthen lamp flinging shadows on the walls .</p>
   <p>Through the howl of the winds she hears him call her name , she whose name is unknown .</p>
   <p>It is long since the Boatman sailed . It will be long before the day breaks and he knocks at the door .</p>
   <p>The drums will not be beaten and none will know .</p>
   <p>Only light shall fill the house , blessed shall be the dust , and the heart glad .</p>
   <p>All doubts shall vanish in silence when the Boatman comes to the shore .</p>

   <p>Do not lose heart , timid thing ! The spring breeze has overheard your desire , the day will not end before you have fulfilled your being .</p>
   <p>Dark is the future to her , and the odour cries in despair , “ Ah me , through whose fault is my life so unmeaning ?</p>
   <p>“ Who can tell me , why I am at all ? ” Do not lose heart , timid thing ! The perfect dawn is near when you will mingle your life with all life and know at last your purpose .</p>

   <p>The hermit boys had brought the cattle home , and sat round the fire to listen to the master , Guatama , when a strange boy came , and greeted him with fruits and flowers , and , bowing low at his feet , spoke in a bird-like voice — “ Lord , I have come to thee to be taken into the path of the supreme Truth .</p>

   <p>Thus saying , Satyakâma took leave , and wading across the shallow stream , came back to his mother 's hut , which stood at the end of the sandy waste at the edge of the sleeping village .</p>
   <p>The lamp burnt dimly in the room , and the mother stood at the door in the dark waiting for her son 's return .</p>
   <p>She clasped him to her bosom , kissed him on his hair , and asked him of his errand to the master .</p>
   <p>“ What is the name of my father , dear mother ? ” asked the boy .</p>
   <p>“ It is only fitting for a Brahmin to aspire to the highest wisdom , said Lord Guatama to me . ”</p>
   <p>The woman lowered her eyes , and spoke in a whisper .</p>
   <p>“ In my youth I was poor and had many masters . Thou didst come to thy mother Jabâlâ 's arms , my darling , who had no husband . ”</p>
   <p>The early rays of the sun glistened on the tree-tops of the forest hermitage .</p>
   <p>The students , with their tangled hair still wet with their morning bath , sat under the ancient tree , before the master .</p>
   <p>There came Satyakâma .</p>
   <p>He bowed low at the feet of the sage , and stood silent .</p>
   <p>“ Tell me , ” the great teacher asked him , “ of what clan art thou ? ”</p>
   <p>“ My lord , ” he answered , “ I know it not . My mother said when I asked her , ‘ I had served many masters in my youth , and thou hadst come to thy mother Jabâlâ 's arms , who had no husband . ’ ”</p>
   <p>There rose a murmur like the angry hum of bees disturbed in their hive ; and the students muttered at the shameless insolence of that outcast .</p>
   <p>Master Guatama rose from his seat , stretched out his arms , took the boy to his bosom , and said , “ Best of all Brahmins art thou , my child . Thou hast the noblest heritage of truth . ”</p>

     <l n="15">prays , the wife watches by the door ;</l>
     <l n="16">There is a wail of parting that rises to the sky ,</l>
     <l n="17">And there is the Captain 's voice in the dark :</l>

     <l n="19">All the black evils in the world have overflowed their banks ,</l>

     <l n="22">Whom do you blame , brothers ? Bow your heads down !</l>
     <l n="23">The sin has been yours and ours .</l>
     <l n="24">The heat growing in the heart of God for ages —</l>
     <l n="25">The cowardice of the weak , the arrogance of the strong , the greed</l>

   <p>Like a ripe pod , let the tempest break its heart into pieces , scattering thunders . Stop your bluster of dispraise and of self-praise , And with the calm of silent prayer on your foreheads sail to that unnamed shore .</p>

    <head>THE SONG OF THE DEFEATED</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My Master has bid me while I stand at the roadside , to sing the</l>
     <l n="2">song of Defeat , for that is the bride whom He woos in secret .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">She has put on the dark veil , hiding her face from the crowd , but</l>
     <l n="4">the jewel glows on her breast in the dark .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">She is forsaken of the day , and God 's night is waiting for her</l>
     <l n="6">with its lamps lighted and flowers wet with dew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">She is silent with her eyes downcast ; she has left her home</l>
     <l n="8">behind her , from her home has come that wailing in the wind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="9">But the stars are singing the love-song of the eternal to a face</l>
     <l n="10">sweet with shame and suffering .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The door has been opened in the lonely chamber , the call has sounded , and the heart of the darkness throbs with awe because of the coming tryst .</p>

    <head>THANKSGIVING</head>
    <head>Those who walk on the path of pride crushing the lowly life under their tread , covering the tender green of the earth with their footprints in blood ;</head>
     <l n="1">Let them rejoice , and thank thee , Lord , for the day is theirs .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But I am thankful that my lot lies with the humble who suffer and bear the burden of power , and hide their faces and stifle their sobs in the dark .</p>
   <p>For every throb of their pain has pulsed in the secret depth of thy night , and every insult has been gathered into thy great silence . And the morrow is theirs .</p>
   <p>O Sun , rise upon the bleeding hearts blossoming in flowers of the morning , and the torchlight revelry of pride shrunken to ashes .</p>
   <p>THE END</p>
