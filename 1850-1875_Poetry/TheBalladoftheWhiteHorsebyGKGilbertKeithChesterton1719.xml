   <p>Prefatory Note :</p>
   <p>This ballad needs no historical notes , for the simple reason that it does not profess to be historical . All of it that is not frankly fictitious , as in any prose romance about the past , is meant to emphasize tradition rather than history . King Alfred is not a legend in the sense that King Arthur may be a legend ; that is , in the sense that he may possibly be a lie . But King Alfred is a legend in this broader and more human sense , that the legends are the most important things about him .</p>
   <p>The cult of Alfred was a popular cult , from the darkness of the ninth century to the deepening twilight of the twentieth . It is wholly as a popular legend that I deal with him here . I write as one ignorant of everything , except that I have found the legend of a King of Wessex still alive in the land . I will give three curt cases of what I mean . A tradition connects the ultimate victory of Alfred with the valley in Berkshire called the Vale of the White Horse . I have seen doubts of the tradition , which may be valid doubts . I do not know when or where the story started ; it is enough that it started somewhere and ended with me ; for I only seek to write upon a hearsay , as the old balladists did . For the second case , there is a popular tale that Alfred played the harp and sang in the Danish camp ; I select it because it is a popular tale , at whatever time it arose . For the third case , there is a popular tale that Alfred came in contact with a woman and cakes ; I select it because it is a popular tale , because it is a vulgar one . It has been disputed by grave historians , who were , I think , a little too grave to be good judges of it . The two chief charges against the story are that it was first recorded long after Alfred 's death , and that ( as Mr. Oman urges ) Alfred never really wandered all alone without any thanes or soldiers . Both these objections might possibly be met . It has taken us nearly as long to learn the whole truth about Byron , and perhaps longer to learn the whole truth about Pepys , than elapsed between Alfred and the first writing of such tales . And as for the other objection , do the historians really think that Alfred after Wilton , or Napoleon after Leipsic , never walked about in a wood by himself for the matter of an hour or two ? Ten minutes might be made sufficient for the essence of the story . But I am not concerned to prove the truth of these popular traditions . It is enough for me to maintain two things : that they are popular traditions ; and that without these popular traditions we should have bothered about Alfred about as much as we bother about Eadwig .</p>
   <p>One other consideration needs a note . Alfred has come down to us in the best way ( that is , by national legends ) solely for the same reason as Arthur and Roland and the other giants of that darkness , because he fought for the Christian civilization against the heathen nihilism . But since this work was really done by generation after generation , by the Romans before they withdrew , and by the Britons while they remained , I have summarised this first crusade in a triple symbol , and given to a fictitious Roman , Celt , and Saxon , a part in the glory of Ethandune . I fancy that in fact Alfred 's Wessex was of very mixed bloods ; but in any case , it is the chief value of legend to mix up the centuries while preserving the sentiment ; to see all ages in a sort of splendid foreshortening . That is the use of tradition : it telescopes history .</p>
