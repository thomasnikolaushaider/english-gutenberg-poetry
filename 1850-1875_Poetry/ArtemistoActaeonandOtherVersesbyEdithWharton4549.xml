    <head>ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THOU couldst not look on me and live : so runs</l>
     <l n="2">The mortal legend — thou that couldst not live</l>
     <l n="3">Nor look on me ( so the divine decree ) !</l>
     <l n="4">That saw'st me in the cloud , the wave , the bough ,</l>
     <l n="5">The clod commoved with April , and the shapes</l>
     <l n="6">Lurking ‘ twixt lid and eye-ball in the dark .</l>
     <l n="7">Mocked I thee not in every guise of life ,</l>
     <l n="8">Hid in girls ’ eyes , a naiad in her well ,</l>
     <l n="9">Wooed through their laughter , and like echo fled ,</l>
     <l n="10">Luring thee down the primal silences</l>
     <l n="11">Where the heart hushes and the flesh is dumb ?</l>
     <l n="12">Nay , was not I the tide that drew thee out</l>
     <l n="13">Relentlessly from the detaining shore ,</l>
     <l n="14">Forth from the home-lights and the hailing voices ,</l>
     <l n="15">Forth from the last faint headland 's failing line ,</l>
     <l n="16">Till I enveloped thee from verge to verge</l>
     <l n="17">And hid thee in the hollow of my being ?</l>
     <l n="18">And still , because between us hung the veil ,</l>
     <l n="19">The myriad-tinted veil of sense , thy feet</l>
     <l n="20">Refused their rest , thy hands the gifts of life ,</l>
     <l n="21">Thy heart its losses , lest some lesser face</l>
     <l n="22">Should blur mine image in thine upturned soul</l>
     <l n="23">Ere death had stamped it there . This was thy thought .</l>
     <l n="24">And mine ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">The gods , they say , have all : not so !</l>
     <l n="26">This have they — flocks on every hill , the blue</l>
     <l n="27">Spirals of incense and the amber drip</l>
     <l n="28">Of lucid honey-comb on sylvan shrines ,</l>
     <l n="29">First-chosen weanlings , doves immaculate ,</l>
     <l n="30">Twin-cooing in the osier-plaited cage ,</l>
     <l n="31">And ivy-garlands glaucous with the dew :</l>
     <l n="32">Man 's wealth , man 's servitude , but not himself !</l>
     <l n="33">And so they pale , for lack of warmth they wane ,</l>
     <l n="34">Freeze to the marble of their images ,</l>
     <l n="35">And , pinnacled on man 's subserviency ,</l>
     <l n="36">Through the thick sacrificial haze discern</l>
     <l n="37">Unheeding lives and loves , as some cold peak</l>
     <l n="38">Through icy mists may enviously descry</l>
     <l n="39">Warm vales unzoned to the all-fruitful sun .</l>
     <l n="40">So they along an immortality</l>
     <l n="41">Of endless-envistaed homage strain their gaze ,</l>
     <l n="42">If haply some rash votary , empty-urned ,</l>
     <l n="43">But light of foot , with all-adventuring hand ,</l>
     <l n="44">Break rank , fling past the people and the priest ,</l>
     <l n="45">Up the last step , on to the inmost shrine ,</l>
     <l n="46">And there , the sacred curtain in his clutch ,</l>
     <l n="47">Drop dead of seeing — while the others prayed !</l>
     <l n="48">Yes , this we wait for , this renews us , this</l>
     <l n="49">Incarnates us , pale people of your dreams ,</l>
     <l n="50">Who are but what you make us , wood or stone ,</l>
     <l n="51">Or cold chryselephantine hung with gems ,</l>
     <l n="52">Or else the beating purpose of your life ,</l>
     <l n="53">Your sword , your clay , the note your pipe pursues ,</l>
     <l n="54">The face that haunts your pillow , or the light</l>
     <l n="55">Scarce visible over leagues of labouring sea !</l>
     <l n="56">O thus through use to reign again , to drink</l>
     <l n="57">The cup of peradventure to the lees ,</l>
     <l n="58">For one dear instant disimmortalised</l>
     <l n="59">In giving immortality !</l>
     <l n="60">So dream the gods upon their listless thrones .</l>
     <l n="61">Yet sometimes , when the votary appears ,</l>
     <l n="62">With death-affronting forehead and glad eyes ,</l>
     <l n="63">Too young , they rather muse , too frail thou art ,</l>
     <l n="64">And shall we rob some girl of saffron veil</l>
     <l n="65">And nuptial garland for so slight a thing ?</l>
     <l n="66">And so to their incurious loves return .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="67">Not so with thee ; for some indeed there are</l>
     <l n="68">Who would behold the truth and then return</l>
     <l n="69">To pine among the semblances — but I</l>
     <l n="70">Divined in thee the questing foot that never</l>
     <l n="71">Revisits the cold hearth of yesterday</l>
     <l n="72">Or calls achievement home . I from afar</l>
     <l n="73">Beheld thee fashioned for one hour 's high use ,</l>
     <l n="74">Nor meant to slake oblivion drop by drop .</l>
     <l n="75">Long , long hadst thou inhabited my dreams ,</l>
     <l n="76">Surprising me as harts surprise a pool ,</l>
     <l n="77">Stealing to drink at midnight ; I divined</l>
     <l n="78">Thee rash to reach the heart of life , and lie</l>
     <l n="79">Bosom to bosom in occasion 's arms .</l>
     <l n="80">And said : Because I love thee thou shalt die !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="81">For immortality is not to range</l>
     <l n="82">Unlimited through vast Olympian days ,</l>
     <l n="83">Or sit in dull dominion over time ;</l>
     <l n="84">But this — to drink fate 's utmost at a draught ,</l>
     <l n="85">Nor feel the wine grow stale upon the lip ,</l>
     <l n="86">To scale the summit of some soaring moment ,</l>
     <l n="87">Nor know the dulness of the long descent ,</l>
     <l n="88">To snatch the crown of life and seal it up</l>
     <l n="89">Secure forever in the vaults of death !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="90">And this was thine : to lose thyself in me ,</l>
     <l n="91">Relive in my renewal , and become</l>
     <l n="92">The light of other lives , a quenchless torch</l>
     <l n="93">Passed on from hand to hand , till men are dust</l>
     <l n="94">And the last garland withers from my shrine .</l>

    <head>LIFE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NAY , lift me to thy lips , Life , and once more</l>
     <l n="2">Pour the wild music through me —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">I quivered in the reed-bed with my kind ,</l>
     <l n="4">Rooted in Lethe-bank , when at the dawn</l>
     <l n="5">There came a groping shape of mystery</l>
     <l n="6">Moving among us , that with random stroke</l>
     <l n="7">Severed , and rapt me from my silent tribe ,</l>
     <l n="8">Pierced , fashioned , lipped me , sounding for a voice ,</l>
     <l n="9">Laughing on Lethe-bank — and in my throat</l>
     <l n="10">I felt the wing-beat of the fledgeling notes ,</l>
     <l n="11">The bubble of godlike laughter in my throat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">Such little songs she sang ,</l>
     <l n="13">Pursing her lips to fit the tiny pipe ,</l>
     <l n="14">They trickled from me like a slender spring</l>
     <l n="15">That strings frail wood-growths on its crystal thread ,</l>
     <l n="16">Nor dreams of glassing cities , bearing ships .</l>
     <l n="17">She sang , and bore me through the April world</l>
     <l n="18">Matching the birds , doubling the insect-hum</l>
     <l n="19">In the meadows , under the low-moving airs ,</l>
     <l n="20">And breathings of the scarce-articulate air</l>
     <l n="21">When it makes mouths of grasses — but when the sky</l>
     <l n="22">Burst into storm , and took great trees for pipes ,</l>
     <l n="23">She thrust me in her breast , and warm beneath</l>
     <l n="24">Her cloudy vesture , on her terrible heart ,</l>
     <l n="25">I shook , and heard the battle .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">But more oft ,</l>
     <l n="27">Those early days , we moved in charmed woods ,</l>
     <l n="28">Where once , at dusk , she piped against a faun ,</l>
     <l n="29">And one warm dawn a tree became a nymph</l>
     <l n="30">Listening ; and trembled ; and Life laughed and passed .</l>
     <l n="31">And once we came to a great stream that bore</l>
     <l n="32">The stars upon its bosom like a sea ,</l>
     <l n="33">And ships like stars ; so to the sea we came .</l>
     <l n="34">And there she raised me to her lips , and sent</l>
     <l n="35">One swift pang through me ; then refrained her hand ,</l>
     <l n="36">And whispered : “ Hear — ” and into my frail flanks ,</l>
     <l n="37">Into my bursting veins , the whole sea poured</l>
     <l n="38">Its spaces and its thunder ; and I feared .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">We came to cities , and Life piped on me</l>
     <l n="40">Low calls to dreaming girls ,</l>
     <l n="41">In counting-house windows , through the chink of gold ,</l>
     <l n="42">Flung cries that fired the captive brain of youth ,</l>
     <l n="43">And made the heavy merchant at his desk</l>
     <l n="44">Curse us for a cracked hurdy-gurdy ; Life</l>
     <l n="45">Mimicked the hurdy-gurdy , and we passed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">We climbed the slopes of solitude , and there</l>
     <l n="47">Life met a god , who challenged her and said :</l>
     <l n="48">“ Thy pipe against my lyre ! ” But “ Wait ! ” she laughed ,</l>
     <l n="49">And in my live flank dug a finger-hole ,</l>
     <l n="50">And wrung new music from it . Ah , the pain !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="51">We climbed and climbed , and left the god behind .</l>
     <l n="52">We saw the earth spread vaster than the sea ,</l>
     <l n="53">With infinite surge of mountains surfed with snow ,</l>
     <l n="54">And a silence that was louder than the deep ;</l>
     <l n="55">But on the utmost pinnacle Life again</l>
     <l n="56">Hid me , and I heard the terror in her hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">Safe in new vales , I ached for the old pang ,</l>
     <l n="58">And clamoured “ Play me against a god again ! ”</l>
     <l n="59">“ Poor Marsyas-mortal — he shall bleed thee yet , ”</l>
     <l n="60">She breathed and kissed me , stilling the dim need .</l>
     <l n="61">But evermore it woke , and stabbed my flank</l>
     <l n="62">With yearnings for new music and new pain .</l>
     <l n="63">“ Another note against another god ! ”</l>
     <l n="64">I clamoured ; and she answered : “ Bide my time .</l>
     <l n="65">Of every heart-wound I will make a stop ,</l>
     <l n="66">And drink thy life in music , pang by pang ,</l>
     <l n="67">But first thou must yield the notes I stored in thee</l>
     <l n="68">At dawn beside the river . Take my lips . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="69">She kissed me like a lover , but I wept ,</l>
     <l n="70">Remembering that high song against the god ,</l>
     <l n="71">And the old songs slept in me , and I was dumb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="72">We came to cavernous foul places , blind</l>
     <l n="73">With harpy-wings , and sulphurous with the glare</l>
     <l n="74">Of sinful furnaces — where hunger toiled ,</l>
     <l n="75">And pleasure gathered in a starveling prey ,</l>
     <l n="76">And death fed delicately on young bones .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="77">“ Now sing ! ” cried Life , and set her lips to me .</l>
     <l n="78">“ Here are gods also . Wilt thou pipe for Dis ? ”</l>
     <l n="79">My cry was drowned beneath the furnace roar ,</l>
     <l n="80">Choked by the sulphur-fumes ; and beast-lipped gods</l>
     <l n="81">Laughed down on me , and mouthed the flutes of hell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="82">“ Now sing ! ” said Life , reissuing to the stars ;</l>
     <l n="83">And wrung a new note from my wounded side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="84">So came we to clear spaces , and the sea .</l>
     <l n="85">And now I felt its volume in my heart ,</l>
     <l n="86">And my heart waxed with it , and Life played on me</l>
     <l n="87">The song of the Infinite . “ Now the stars , ” she said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="88">Then from the utmost pinnacle again</l>
     <l n="89">She poured me on the wild sidereal stream ,</l>
     <l n="90">And I grew with her great breathings , till we swept</l>
     <l n="91">The interstellar spaces like new worlds</l>
     <l n="92">Loosed from the fiery ruin of a star .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="93">Cold , cold we rested on black peaks again ,</l>
     <l n="94">Under black skies , under a groping wind ;</l>
     <l n="95">And Life , grown old , hugged me to a numb breast ,</l>
     <l n="96">Pressing numb lips against me . Suddenly</l>
     <l n="97">A blade of silver severed the black peaks</l>
     <l n="98">From the black sky , and earth was born again ,</l>
     <l n="99">Breathing and various , under a god 's feet .</l>
     <l n="100">A god ! A god ! I felt the heart of Life</l>
     <l n="101">Leap under me , and my cold flanks shook again .</l>
     <l n="102">He bore no lyre , he rang no challenge out ,</l>
     <l n="103">But Life warmed to him , warming me with her ,</l>
     <l n="104">And as he neared I felt beneath her hands</l>
     <l n="105">The stab of a new wound that sucked my soul</l>
     <l n="106">Forth in a new song from my throbbing throat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="107">“ His name — his name ? ” I whispered , but she shed</l>
     <l n="108">The music faster , and I grew with it ,</l>
     <l n="109">Became a part of it , while Life and I</l>
     <l n="110">Clung lip to lip , and I from her wrung song</l>
     <l n="111">As she from me , one song , one ecstasy ,</l>
     <l n="112">In indistinguishable union blent ,</l>
     <l n="113">Till she became the flute and I the player .</l>
     <l n="114">And lo ! the song I played on her was more</l>
     <l n="115">Than any she had drawn from me ; it held</l>
     <l n="116">The stars , the peaks , the cities , and the sea ,</l>
     <l n="117">The faun 's catch , the nymph 's tremor , and the heart</l>
     <l n="118">Of dreaming girls , of toilers at the desk ,</l>
     <l n="119">Apollo 's challenge on the sunrise slope ,</l>
     <l n="120">And the hiss of the night-gods mouthing flutes of hell —</l>
     <l n="121">All , to the dawn-wind 's whisper in the reeds ,</l>
     <l n="122">When Life first came , a shape of mystery ,</l>
     <l n="123">Moving among us , and with random stroke</l>
     <l n="124">Severed , and rapt me from my silent tribe .</l>
     <l n="125">All this I wrung from her in that deep hour ,</l>
     <l n="126">While Love stood murmuring : “ Play the god , poor grass ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="127">Now , by that hour , I am a mate to thee</l>

   <p>Note .— Vesalius , the great anatomist , studied at Louvain and Paris , and was called by Venice to the chair of surgery in the University of Padua . He was one of the first physiologists to dissect the human body , and his great work “ The Structure of the Human Body ” was an open attack on the physiology of Galen . The book excited such violent opposition , not only in the Church but in the University , that in a fit of discouragement he burned his remaining manuscripts and accepted the post of physician at the Court of Charles V ., and afterward of his son , Philip II , of Spain . This closed his life of free enquiry , for the Inquisition forbade all scientific research , and the dissection of corpses was prohibited in Spain . Vesalius led for many years the life of the rich and successful court physician , but regrets for his past were never wholly extinguished , and in 1561 they were roused afresh by the reading of an anatomical treatise by Gabriel Fallopius , his successor in the chair at Padua . From that moment life in Spain became intolerable to Vesalius , and in 1563 he set out for the East . Tradition reports that this journey was a penance to which the Church condemned him for having opened the body of a woman before she was actually dead ; but more probably Vesalius , sick of his long servitude , made the pilgrimage a pretext to escape from Spain .</p>
   <p>Fallopius had meanwhile died , and the Venetian Senate is said to have offered Vesalius his old chair ; but on the way home from Jerusalem he was seized with illness , and died at Zante in 1564 .</p>
