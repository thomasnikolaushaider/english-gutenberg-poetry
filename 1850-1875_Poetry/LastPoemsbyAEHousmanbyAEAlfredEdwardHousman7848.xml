    <docTitle><titlePart>LAST POEMS By A. E. Housman</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>I publish these poems , few though they are , because it is not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more . I can no longer expect to be revisited by the continuous excitement under which in the early months of<date>1895</date>I wrote the greater part of my first book , nor indeed could I well sustain it if it came ; and it is best that what I have written should be printed while I am here to see it through the press and control its spelling and punctuation . About a quarter of this matter belongs to the April of the present year , but most of it to dates between<date>1895</date>and<date>1910</date>. September<date>1922</date></docImprint>
