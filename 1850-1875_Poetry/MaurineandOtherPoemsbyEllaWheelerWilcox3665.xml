      <head>PART I</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I sat and sewed , and sang some tender tune ,</l>
       <l n="2">Oh , beauteous was that morn in early June !</l>
       <l n="3">Mellow with sunlight , and with blossoms fair :</l>
       <l n="4">The climbing rose-tree grew about me there ,</l>
       <l n="5">And checked with shade the sunny portico</l>
       <l n="6">Where , morns like this , I came to read , or sew .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">I heard the gate click , and a firm , quick tread</l>
       <l n="8">Upon the walk . No need to turn my head ;</l>
       <l n="9">I would mistake , and doubt my own voice sounding ,</l>
       <l n="10">Before his step upon the gravel bounding .</l>
       <l n="11">In an unstudied attitude of grace ,</l>
       <l n="12">He stretched his comely form ; and from his face</l>
       <l n="13">He tossed the dark , damp curls ; and at my knees ,</l>
       <l n="14">With his broad hat he fanned the lazy breeze ,</l>
       <l n="15">And turned his head , and lifted his large eyes ,</l>
       <l n="16">Of that strange hue we see in ocean dyes ,</l>
       <l n="17">And call it blue sometimes and sometimes green ,</l>
       <l n="18">And save in poet eyes , not elsewhere seen .</l>
       <l n="19">“ Lest I should meet with my fair lady 's scorning ,</l>
       <l n="20">For calling quite so early in the morning ,</l>
       <l n="21">I 've brought a passport that can never fail , ”</l>
       <l n="22">He said , and , laughing , laid the morning mail</l>
       <l n="23">Upon my lap . “ I 'm welcome ? so I thought !</l>
       <l n="24">I 'll figure by the letters that I brought</l>
       <l n="25">How glad you are to see me . Only one ?</l>
       <l n="26">And that one from a lady ? I 'm undone !</l>
       <l n="27">That , lightly skimmed , you 'll think me SUCH a bore ,</l>
       <l n="28">And wonder why I did not bring you four .</l>
       <l n="29">It 's ever thus : a woman cannot get</l>
       <l n="30">So many letters that she will not fret</l>
       <l n="31">O'er one that did not come . ”</l>
       <l n="32">“ I 'll prove you wrong , ”</l>
       <l n="33">I answered gaily , “ here upon the spot !</l>
       <l n="34">This little letter , precious if not long ,</l>
       <l n="35">Is just the one , of all you might have brought ,</l>
       <l n="36">To please me . You have heard me speak , I 'm sure ,</l>
       <l n="37">Of Helen Trevor : she writes here to say</l>
       <l n="38">She 's coming out to see me ; and will stay</l>
       <l n="39">Till Autumn , maybe . She is , like her note ,</l>
       <l n="40">Petite and dainty , tender , loving , pure .</l>
       <l n="41">You 'd know her by a letter that she wrote ,</l>
       <l n="42">For a sweet tinted thing . ‘ Tis always so : -</l>
       <l n="43">Letters all blots , though finely written , show</l>
       <l n="44">A slovenly person . Letters stiff and white</l>
       <l n="45">Bespeak a nature honest , plain , upright .</l>
       <l n="46">And tissuey , tinted , perfumed notes , like this ,</l>
       <l n="47">Tell of a creature formed to pet and kiss . ”</l>
       <l n="48">My listener heard me with a slow , odd smile ;</l>
       <l n="49">Stretched in abandon at my feet , the while ,</l>
       <l n="50">He fanned me idly with his broad-brimmed hat .</l>
       <l n="51">“ Then all young ladies must be formed for that ! ”</l>
       <l n="52">He laughed , and said .</l>
       <l n="53">“ Their letters read , and look ,</l>
       <l n="54">As like as twenty copies of one book .</l>
       <l n="55">They 're written in a dainty , spider scrawl ,</l>
       <l n="56">To ‘ darling , precious Kate , ’ or ‘ Fan , ’ or ‘ Moll . ’</l>
       <l n="57">The ‘ dearest , sweetest ’ friend they ever had .</l>
       <l n="58">They say they ‘ want to see you , oh , so bad ! ’</l>
       <l n="59">Vow they 'll ‘ forget you , never , NEVER , oh ! ’</l>
       <l n="60">And then they tell about a splendid beau -</l>
       <l n="61">A lovely hat — a charming dress , and send</l>
       <l n="62">A little scrap of this to every friend .</l>
       <l n="63">And then to close , for lack of something better ,</l>
       <l n="64">They beg you 'll ‘ read and burn this horrid letter . ’ ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="65">He watched me , smiling . He was prone to vex</l>
       <l n="66">And hector me with flings upon my sex .</l>
       <l n="67">He liked , he said , to have me flash and frown ,</l>
       <l n="68">So he could tease me , and then laugh me down .</l>
       <l n="69">My storms of wrath amused him very much :</l>
       <l n="70">He liked to see me go off at a touch ;</l>
       <l n="71">Anger became me — made my colour rise ,</l>
       <l n="72">And gave an added lustre to my eyes .</l>
       <l n="73">So he would talk — and so he watched me now ,</l>
       <l n="74">To see the hot flush mantle cheek and brow .</l>
       <l n="75">Instead , I answered coolly , with a smile ,</l>
       <l n="76">Felling a seam with utmost care , meanwhile .</l>
       <l n="77">“ The caustic tongue of Vivian Dangerfield</l>
       <l n="78">Is barbed as ever , for my sex , this morn .</l>
       <l n="79">Still unconvinced , no smallest point I yield .</l>
       <l n="80">Woman I love , and trust , despite your scorn .</l>
       <l n="81">There is some truth in what you say ? Well , yes !</l>
       <l n="82">Your statements usually hold more or less .</l>
       <l n="83">Some women write weak letters — ( some men do ;)</l>
       <l n="84">Some make professions , knowing them untrue .</l>
       <l n="85">And woman 's friendship , in the time of need ,</l>
       <l n="86">I own , too often proves a broken reed .</l>
       <l n="87">But I believe , and ever will contend ,</l>
       <l n="88">Woman can be a sister woman 's friend ,</l>
       <l n="89">Giving from out her large heart 's bounteous store</l>
       <l n="90">A living love — claiming to do no more</l>
       <l n="91">Than , through and by that love , she knows she can :</l>
       <l n="92">And living by her professions , LIKE A MAN .</l>
       <l n="93">And such a tie , true friendship 's silken tether ,</l>
       <l n="94">Binds Helen Trevor 's heart and mine together .</l>
       <l n="95">I love her for her beauty , meekness , grace ;</l>
       <l n="96">For her white lily soul and angel face .</l>
       <l n="97">She loves me , for my greater strength , maybe ;</l>
       <l n="98">Loves — and would give her heart 's best blood for me .</l>
       <l n="99">And I , to save her from a pain , or cross ,</l>
       <l n="100">Would suffer any sacrifice or loss .</l>
       <l n="101">Such can be woman 's friendship for another .</l>
       <l n="102">Could man give more , or ask more from a brother ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="103">I paused : and Vivian leaned his massive head</l>
       <l n="104">Against the pillar of the portico ,</l>
       <l n="105">Smiled his slow , sceptic smile , then laughed , and said :</l>
       <l n="106">“ Nay , surely not — if what you say be so .</l>
       <l n="107">You 've made a statement , but no proof 's at hand .</l>
       <l n="108">Wait — do not flash your eyes so ! Understand</l>
       <l n="109">I think you quite sincere in what you say :</l>
       <l n="110">You love your friend , and she loves you , to-day ;</l>
       <l n="111">But friendship is not friendship at the best</l>
       <l n="112">Till circumstances put it to the test .</l>
       <l n="113">Man 's , less demonstrative , stands strain and tear ,</l>
       <l n="114">While woman 's , half profession , fails to wear .</l>
       <l n="115">Two women love each other passing well -</l>
       <l n="116">Say Helen Trevor and Maurine La Pelle ,</l>
       <l n="117">Just for example .</l>
       <l n="118">Let them daily meet</l>
       <l n="119">At ball and concert , in the church and street ,</l>
       <l n="120">They kiss and coo , they visit , chat , caress ;</l>
       <l n="121">Their love increases , rather than grows less ;</l>
       <l n="122">And all goes well , till ‘ Helen dear ’ discovers</l>
       <l n="123">That ‘ Maurine darling ’ wins too many lovers .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="124">And then her ‘ precious friend , ’ her ‘ pet , ’ her ‘ sweet , ’</l>
       <l n="125">Becomes a ‘ minx , ’ a ‘ creature all deceit . ’</l>
       <l n="126">Let Helen smile too oft on Maurine 's beaux ,</l>
       <l n="127">Or wear more stylish or becoming clothes ,</l>
       <l n="128">Or sport a hat that has a longer feather -</l>
       <l n="129">And lo ! the strain has broken ‘ friendship 's tether . ’</l>
       <l n="130">Maurine 's sweet smile becomes a frown or pout ;</l>
       <l n="131">‘ She 's just begun to find that Helen out . ’</l>
       <l n="132">The breach grows wider — anger fills each heart ;</l>
       <l n="133">They drift asunder , whom ‘ but death could part . ’</l>
       <l n="134">You shake your head ? Oh , well , we 'll never know !</l>
       <l n="135">It is not likely Fate will test you so .</l>
       <l n="136">You 'll live , and love ; and , meeting twice a year ,</l>
       <l n="137">While life shall last , you 'll hold each other dear .</l>
       <l n="138">I pray it may be so ; it were not best</l>
       <l n="139">To shake your faith in woman by the test .</l>
       <l n="140">Keep your belief , and nurse it while you can .</l>
       <l n="141">I 've faith in woman 's friendship too — for man !</l>
       <l n="142">They 're true as steel , as mothers , friends , and wives :</l>
       <l n="143">And that 's enough to bless us all our lives .</l>
       <l n="144">That man 's a selfish fellow , and a bore ,</l>
       <l n="145">Who is unsatisfied and asks for more . ”</l>
       <l n="146">“ But there is need of more ! ” I here broke in .</l>
       <l n="147">“ I hold that woman guilty of a sin ,</l>
       <l n="148">Who would not cling to , and defend another ,</l>
       <l n="149">As nobly as she would stand by a brother .</l>
       <l n="150">Who would not suffer for a sister 's sake ,</l>
       <l n="151">And , were there need to prove her friendship , make</l>
       <l n="152">‘ Most any sacrifice , nor count the cost .</l>
       <l n="153">Who would not do this for a friend is lost</l>
       <l n="154">To every nobler principle . ”</l>
       <l n="155">“ Shame , shame ! ”</l>
       <l n="156">Cried Vivian , laughing , “ for you now defame</l>
       <l n="157">The whole sweet sex ; since there 's not one would do</l>
       <l n="158">The thing you name , nor would I want her to .</l>
       <l n="159">I love the sex . My mother was a woman -</l>
       <l n="160">I hope my wife will be , and wholly human .</l>
       <l n="161">And if she wants to make some sacrifice ,</l>
       <l n="162">I 'll think her far more sensible and wise</l>
       <l n="163">To let her husband reap the benefit ,</l>
       <l n="164">Instead of some old maid or senseless chit .</l>
       <l n="165">Selfish ? Of course ! I hold all love is so :</l>
       <l n="166">And I shall love my wife right well , I know .</l>
       <l n="167">Now there 's a point regarding selfish love ,</l>
       <l n="168">You thirst to argue with me , and disprove .</l>
       <l n="169">But since these cosy hours will soon be gone ,</l>
       <l n="170">And all our meetings broken in upon ,</l>
       <l n="171">No more of these rare moments must be spent</l>
       <l n="172">In vain discussions , or in argument .</l>
       <l n="173">I wish Miss Trevor was in — Jericho !</l>
       <l n="174">( You see the selfishness begins to show . )</l>
       <l n="175">She wants to see you ?— So do I : but she</l>
       <l n="176">Will gain her wish , by taking you from me .</l>
       <l n="177">‘ Come all the same ? ’ that means I 'll be allowed</l>
       <l n="178">To realize that ‘ three can make a crowd . ’</l>
       <l n="179">I do not like to feel myself de trop .</l>
       <l n="180">With two girl cronies would I not be so ?</l>
       <l n="181">My ring would interrupt some private chat .</l>
       <l n="182">You 'd ask me in and take my cane and hat ,</l>
       <l n="183">And speak about the lovely summer day ,</l>
       <l n="184">And think — ‘ The lout ! I wish he 'd kept away . ’</l>
       <l n="185">Miss Trevor 'd smile , but just to hide a pout</l>
       <l n="186">And count the moments till I was shown out .</l>
       <l n="187">And , while I twirled my thumbs , I would sit wishing</l>
       <l n="188">That I had gone off hunting birds , or fishing ,</l>
       <l n="189">No , thanks , Maurine ! The iron hand of Fate ,</l>
       <l n="190">( Or otherwise Miss Trevor 's dainty fingers ,)</l>
       <l n="191">Will bar my entrance into Eden 's gate ;</l>
       <l n="192">And I shall be like some poor soul that lingers</l>
       <l n="193">At heaven 's portal , paying the price of sin ,</l>
       <l n="194">Yet hoping to be pardoned and let in . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="195">He looked so melancholy sitting there ,</l>
       <l n="196">I laughed outright . “ How well you act a part ;</l>
       <l n="197">You look the very picture of despair !</l>
       <l n="198">You 've missed your calling , sir ! suppose you start</l>
       <l n="199">Upon a starring tour , and carve your name</l>
       <l n="200">With Booth 's and Barrett 's on the heights of Fame</l>
       <l n="201">But now , tabooing nonsense , I shall send</l>
       <l n="202">For you to help me entertain my friend ,</l>
       <l n="203">Unless you come without it . ‘ Cronies ? ’ True ,</l>
       <l n="204">Wanting our ‘ private chats ’ as cronies do .</l>
       <l n="205">And we 'll take those , while you are reading Greek ,</l>
       <l n="206">Or writing ‘ Lines to Dora 's brow ’ or ‘ cheek . ’</l>
       <l n="207">But when you have an hour or two of leisure ,</l>
       <l n="208">Call as you now do , and afford like pleasure .</l>
       <l n="209">For never yet did heaven 's sun shine on ,</l>
       <l n="210">Or stars discover , that phenomenon ,</l>
       <l n="211">In any country , or in any clime :</l>
       <l n="212">Two maids so bound , by ties of mind and heart ,</l>
       <l n="213">They did not feel the heavy weight of time</l>
       <l n="214">In weeks of scenes wherein no man took part .</l>
       <l n="215">God made the sexes to associate :</l>
       <l n="216">Nor law of man , nor stern decree of Fate ,</l>
       <l n="217">Can ever undo what His hand has done ,</l>

        <l n="359">And more and more I felt my heart upreaching</l>
        <l n="360">Toward the truth , drawn gently by his teaching ,</l>
        <l n="361">As flowers are drawn by sunlight . And there grew</l>
        <l n="362">A strange , shy something in its depths , I knew</l>
        <l n="363">At length was love , because it was so sad</l>
        <l n="364">And yet so sweet , and made my heart so glad ,</l>
        <l n="365">Yet seemed to pain me . Then , for very shame ,</l>
        <l n="366">Lest all should read my secret and its name ,</l>
        <l n="367">I strove to hide it in my breast away ,</l>
        <l n="368">Where God could see it only . But each day</l>
        <l n="369">It seemed to grow within me , and would rise ,</l>
        <l n="370">Like my own soul , and look forth from my eyes ,</l>
        <l n="371">Defying bonds of silence ; and would speak ,</l>
        <l n="372">In its red-lettered language , on my cheek ,</l>
        <l n="373">If but his name was uttered . You were kind ,</l>
        <l n="374">My own Maurine ! as you alone could be ,</l>
        <l n="375">So long the sharer of my heart and mind ,</l>
        <l n="376">While yet you saw , in seeming not to see .</l>
        <l n="377">In all the years we have been friends , my own ,</l>
        <l n="378">And loved as women very rarely do ,</l>
        <l n="379">My heart no sorrow and no joy has known</l>
        <l n="380">It has not shared at once , in full , with you .</l>
        <l n="381">And I so longed to speak to you of this ,</l>
        <l n="382">When first I felt its mingled pain and bliss ;</l>
        <l n="383">Yet dared not , lest you , knowing him , should say ,</l>
        <l n="384">In pity for my folly — ‘ Lack-a-day !</l>
        <l n="385">You are undone : because no mortal art</l>
        <l n="386">Can win the love of such a lofty heart . ’</l>
        <l n="387">And so I waited , silent and in pain ,</l>
        <l n="388">Till I could know I did not love in vain .</l>
        <l n="389">And now I know , beyond a doubt or fear .</l>
        <l n="390">Did he not say , ‘ If she I hold most dear</l>
        <l n="391">Slipped from my life , and no least hope were left ,</l>
        <l n="392">My heart would find the years more lonely here</l>
        <l n="393">Than if I were of wealth , fame , friends , bereft ,</l>
        <l n="394">And sent , an exile , to a foreign land ’ ?</l>
        <l n="395">Oh , darling , you must LOVE , to understand</l>
        <l n="396">The joy that thrilled all through me at those words .</l>
        <l n="397">It was as if a thousand singing birds</l>
        <l n="398">Within my heart broke forth in notes of praise .</l>
        <l n="399">I did not look up , but I knew his gaze</l>
        <l n="400">Was on my face , and that his eyes must see</l>
        <l n="401">The joy I felt almost transfigured me .</l>
        <l n="402">He loves me — loves me ! so the birds kept singing ,</l>
        <l n="403">And all my soul with that sweet strain is ringing .</l>
        <l n="404">If there were added but one drop of bliss ,</l>
        <l n="405">No more my cup would hold : and so , this eve ,</l>
        <l n="406">I made a wish that I might feel his kiss</l>
        <l n="407">Upon my lips , ere yon pale moon should leave</l>
        <l n="408">The stars all lonely , having waned away ,</l>
