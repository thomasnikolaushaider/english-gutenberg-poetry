    <list type="contents">
     <item>1 Darkly you sweep on , Eternal Fugitive , round whose bodiless rush stagnant space frets into eddying bubbles of light . Is your heart lost to the Lover calling you across his immeasurable loneliness ? Is the aching urgency of your haste the sole reason why your tangled tresses break into stormy riot and pearls of fire roll along your path as from a broken necklace ? Your fleeting steps kiss the dust of this world into sweetness , sweeping aside all waste ; the storm centred with your dancing limbs shakes the sacred shower of death over life and freshens her growth . Should you in sudden weariness stop for a moment , the world would rumble into a heap , an encumbrance , barring its own progress , and even the least speck of dust would pierce the sky throughout its infinity with an unbearable pressure . My thoughts are quickened by this rhythm of unseen feet round which the anklets of light are shaken . They echo in the pulse of my heart , and through my blood surges the psalm of the ancient sea . I hear the thundering flood tumbling my life from world to world and form to form , scattering my being in an endless spray of gifts , in sorrowings and songs . The tide runs high , the wind blows , the boat dances like thine own desire , my heart ! Leave the hoard on the shore and sail over the unfathomed dark towards limitless light .</item>
     <item>2 We came hither together , friend , and now at the cross-roads I stop to bid you farewell . Your path is wide and straight before you , but my call comes up by ways from the unknown . I shall follow wind and cloud ; I shall follow the stars to where day breaks behind the hills ; I shall follow lovers who , as they walk , twine their days into a wreath on a single thread of song , “ I love . ”</item>
     <item>3 It was growing dark when I asked her , “ What strange land have I come to ? ” She only lowered her eyes , and the water gurgled in the throat of her jar , as she walked away . The trees hang vaguely over the bank , and the land appears as though it already belonged to the past . The water is dumb , the bamboos are darkly still , a wristlet tinkles against the water-jar from down the lane . Row no more , but fasten the boat to this tree ,— for I love the look of this land . The evening star goes down behind the temple dome , and the pallor of the marble landing haunts the dark water . Belated wayfarers sigh ; for light from hidden windows is splintered into the darkness by intervening wayside trees and bushes . Still that wristlet tinkles against the water-jar , and retreating steps rustle from down the lane littered with leaves . The night deepens , the palace towers loom spectre-like , and the town hums wearily . Row no more , but fasten the boat to a tree . Let me seek rest in this strange land , dimly lying under the stars , where darkness tingles with the tinkle of a wristlet knocking against a water-jar .</item>
     <item>4 O that I were stored with a secret , like unshed rain in summer clouds — a secret , folded up in silence , that I could wander away with . O that I had some one to whisper to , where slow waters lap under trees that doze in the sun . The hush this evening seems to expect a footfall , and you ask me for the cause of my tears . I cannot give a reason why I weep , for that is a secret still withheld from me .</item>
     <item>5 For once be careless , timid traveller , and utterly lose your way ; wide-awake though you are , be like broad daylight enticed by and netted in mist . Do not shun the garden of Lost Hearts waiting at the end of the wrong road , where the grass is strewn with wrecked red flowers , and disconsolate water heaves in the troubled sea . Long have you watched over the store gathered by weary years . Let it be stripped , with nothing remaining but the desolate triumph of losing all .</item>
     <item>6 Two little bare feet flit over the ground , and seem to embody that metaphor , “ Flowers are the footprints of summer . ” They lightly impress on the dust the chronicle of their adventure , to be erased by a passing breeze . Come , stray into my heart , you tender little feet , and leave the everlasting print of songs on my dreamland path .</item>
     <item>7 I am like the night to you , little flower . I can only give you peace and a wakeful silence hidden in the dark . When in the morning you open your eyes , I shall leave you to a world a-hum with bees , and songful with birds . My last gift to you will be a tear dropped into the depth of your youth ; it will make your smile all the sweeter , and bemist your outlook on the pitiless mirth of day .</item>
     <item>8 Do not stand before my window with those hungry eyes and beg for my secret . It is but a tiny stone of glistening pain streaked with blood-red by passion . What gifts have you brought in both hands to fling before me in the dust ? I fear , if I accept , to create a debt that can never be paid even by the loss of all I have . Do not stand before my window with your youth and flowers to shame my destitute life .</item>
     <item>9 If I were living in the royal town of Ujjain , when Kalidas was the king 's poet , I should know some Malwa girl and fill my thoughts with the music of her name . She would glance at me through the slanting shadow of her eyelids , and allow her veil to catch in the jasmine as an excuse for lingering near me . This very thing happened in some past whose track is lost under time 's dead leaves . The scholars fight to-day about dates that play hide-and-seek . I do not break my heart dreaming over flown and vanished ages : but alas and alas again , that those Malwa girls have followed them ! To what heaven , I wonder , have they carried in their flower-baskets those days that tingled to the lyrics of the king 's poet ? This morning , separation from those whom I was born too late to meet weighs on and saddens my heart . Yet April carries the same flowers with which they decked their hair , and the same south breeze fluttered their veils as whispers over modern roses . And , to tell the truth , joys are not lacking to this spring , though Kalidas sing no more ; and I know , if he can watch me from the Poets ’ Paradise , he has reasons to be envious .</item>
     <item>10 Be not concerned about her heart , my heart : leave it in the dark . What if her beauty be of the figure and her smile merely of the face ? Let me take without question the simple meaning of her glances and be happy . I care not if it be a web of delusion that her arms wind about me , for the web itself is rich and rare , and the deceit can be smiled at and forgotten . Be not concerned about her heart , my heart : be content if the music is true , though the words are not to be believed ; enjoy the grace that dances like a lily on the rippling , deceiving surface , whatever may lie beneath .</item>
     <item>11 Neither mother nor daughter are you , nor bride , Urvashi .<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Woman you are , to ravish the soul of Paradise . [ Footnote 1 : The dancing girl of Paradise who rose from the sea . ] When weary-footed evening comes down to the folds whither the cattle have returned , you never trim the house lamps nor walk to the bridal bed with a tremulous heart and a wavering smile on your lips , glad that the dark hours are so secret . Like the dawn you are without veil , Urvashi , and without shame . Who can imagine that aching overflow of splendour which created you ! You rose from the churned ocean on the first day of the first spring , with the cup of life in your right hand and poison in your left . The monster sea , lulled like an enchanted snake , laid down its thousand hoods at your feet . Your unblemished radiance rose from the foam , white and naked as a jasmine . Were you ever small , timid or in bud , Urvashi , O Youth everlasting ? Did you sleep , cradled in the deep blue night where the strange light of gems plays over coral , shells and moving creatures of dreamlike form , till day revealed your awful fulness of bloom ? Adored are you of all men in all ages , Urvashi , O endless wonder ! The world throbs with youthful pain at the glance of your eyes , the ascetic lays the fruit of his austerities at your feet , the songs of poets hum and swarm round the perfume of your presence . Your feet , as in careless joy they flit on , wound even the heart of the hollow wind with the tinkle of golden bells . When you dance before the gods , flinging orbits of novel rhythm into space , Urvashi , the earth shivers , leaf and grass , and autumn fields heave and sway ; the sea surges into a frenzy of rhyming waves ; the stars drop into the sky — beads from the chain that leaps till it breaks on your breast ; and the blood dances in men 's hearts with sudden turmoil . You are the first break on the crest of heaven 's slumber , Urvashi , you thrill the air with unrest . The world bathes your limbs in her tears ; with colour of her heart 's blood are your feet red ; lightly you poise on the wave-tossed lotus of desire , Urvashi ; you play forever in that limitless mind wherein labours God 's tumultuous dream .</item>
     <item>12 You , like a rivulet swift and sinuous , laugh and dance , and your steps sing as you trip along . I , like a bank rugged and steep , stand speechless and stock-still and darkly gaze at you . I , like a big , foolish storm , of a sudden come rushing on and try to rend my being and scatter it parcelled in a whirl of passion . You , like the lightning 's flash slender and keen , pierce the heart of the turbulent darkness , to disappear in a vivid streak of laughter .</item>
     <item>13 You desired my love and yet you did not love me . Therefore my life clings to you like a chain of which clank and grip grow harsher the more you struggle to be free . My despair has become your deadly companion , clutching at the faintest of your favours , trying to drag you away into the cavern of tears . You have shattered my freedom , and with its wreck built your own prison .</item>
     <item>14 I am glad you will not wait for me with that lingering pity in your look . It is only the spell of the night and my farewell words , startled at their own tune of despair , which bring these tears to my eyes . But day will dawn , my eyes will dry and my heart ; and there will be no time for weeping . Who says it is hard to forget ? The mercy of death works at life 's core , bringing it respite from its own foolish persistence . The stormy sea is lulled at last in its rocking cradle ; the forest fire falls to sleep on its bed of ashes . You and I shall part , and the cleavage will be hidden under living grass and flowers that laugh in the sun .</item>
     <item>15 Of all days you have chosen this one to visit my garden . But the storm passed over my roses last night and the grass is strewn with torn leaves . I do not know what has brought you , now that the hedges are laid low and rills run in the walks ; the prodigal wealth of spring is scattered and the scent and song of yesterday are wrecked . Yet stay a while ; let me find some remnant flowers , though I doubt if your skirt can be filled . The time will be short , for the clouds thicken and here comes the rain again !</item>
     <item>16 I forgot myself for a moment , and I came . But raise your eyes , and let me know if there still linger some shadow of other days , like a pale cloud on the horizon that has been robbed of its rain . For a moment bear with me if I forget myself . The roses are still in bud ; they do not yet know how we neglect to gather flowers this summer . The morning star has the same palpitating hush ; the early light is enmeshed in the branches that overbrow your window , as in those other days . That times are changed I forget for a little , and have come . I forget if you ever shamed me by looking away when I bared my heart . I only remember the words that stranded on the tremor of your lips ; I remember in your dark eyes sweeping shadows of passion , like the wings of a home-seeking bird in the dusk . I forget that you do not remember , and I come .</item>
     <item>17 The rain fell fast . The river rushed and hissed . It licked up and swallowed the island , while I waited alone on the lessening bank with my sheaves of corn in a heap . From the shadows of the opposite shore the boat crosses with a woman at the helm . I cry to her , “ Come to my island coiled round with hungry water , and take away my year 's harvest . ” She comes , and takes all that I have to the last grain ; I ask her to take me . But she says , “ No ” — the boat is laden with my gift and no room is left for me .</item>
     <item>18 The evening beckons , and I would fain follow the travellers who sailed in the last ferry of the ebb-tide to cross the dark . Some were for home , some for the farther shore , yet all have ventured to sail . But I sit alone at the landing , having left my home and missed the boat : summer is gone and my winter harvest is lost . I wait for that love which gathers failures to sow them in tears on the dark , that they may bear fruit when day rises anew .</item>
     <item>19 On this side of the water there is no landing ; the girls do not come here to fetch water ; the land along its edge is shaggy with stunted shrubs ; a noisy flock of saliks dig their nests in the steep bank under whose frown the fisher-boats find no shelter . You sit there on the unfrequented grass , and the morning wears on . Tell me what you do on this bank so dry that it is agape with cracks ? She looks in my face and says , “ Nothing , nothing whatsoever . ” On this side of the river the bank is deserted , and no cattle come to water . Only some stray goats from the village browse the scanty grass all day , and the solitary water-hawk watches from an uprooted peepal aslant over the mud . You sit there alone in the miserly shade of a shimool , and the morning wears on . Tell me , for whom do you wait ? She looks in my face and says , “ No one , no one at all ! ”</item>

     <head>KACHA AND DEVAYANI</head>
     <p>Young Kacha came from Paradise to learn the secret of immortality from a Sage who taught the Titans , and whose daughter Devayani fell in love with him .</p>
     <p>KACHA</p>
     <p>The time has come for me to take leave , Devayani ; I have long sat at your father 's feet , but to-day he completed his teaching . Graciously allow me to go back to the land of the Gods whence I came .</p>

     <p>DEVAYANI</p>
     <p>Then you must be the one happy being in creation . Alas ! now for the first time I feel what torture these days spent in an alien land have been to you , though we offered you our best .</p>

     <p>Smile ! But , my friend , this is not your native Paradise . Smiles are not so cheap in this world , where thirst , like a worm in the flower , gnaws at the heart 's core ; where baffled desire hovers round the desired , and memory never ceases to sigh foolishly after vanished joy .</p>

     <p>Is it so easy for you to leave this forest , which through long years has lavished on you shade and song ?

     <p>DEVAYANI</p>
     <p>I asked in surprise who you were , and you meekly answered that you were the son of Vrihaspati , a divine sage at the court of the God Indra , and desired to learn from my father that secret spell which can revive the dead .</p>

       <l n="1">I feared lest the Master , the teacher of the Titans , those rivals of the</l>

     </lg>
     <p>DEVAYANI</p>
     <p>Gratitude ! Forget all — I shall not grieve . Do you only remember benefits ? Let them perish ! If after the day 's lessons , in the evening solitude , some strange tremor of joy shook your heart , remember that — but not gratitude . If , as some one passed , a snatch of song got tangled among your texts or the swing of a robe fluttered your studies with delight , remember that when at leisure in your Paradise . What , benefits only !— and neither beauty nor love nor ...?</p>

     <p>Yes , yes , I know . My love has sounded your heart 's deepest , and makes me bold to speak in defiance of your reserve . Never leave me ! remain here ! fame gives no happiness . Friend , you cannot now escape , for your secret is mine !</p>

     <p>How “ No ” ? Do not lie to me ! Love 's insight is divine . Day after day , in raising your head , in a glance , in the motion of your hands , your love spoke as the sea speaks through its waves . On a sudden my voice would send your heart quivering through your limbs — have I never witnessed it ? I know you , and therefore you are my captive for ever . The very king of your Gods shall not sever this bond .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>DEVAYANI</p>
     <p>Why not ? Is only knowledge precious ? Is love cheap ? Lay hold on this moment . Have the courage to own that a woman 's heart is worth all as much penance as men undergo for the sake of power , knowledge , or reputation .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>DEVAYANI</p>
     <p>But is it true you had eyes for nothing save your books ? That you never broke off your studies to pay me homage with flowers , never lay in wait for a chance , of an evening , to help me water my flower-beds ? What made you sit by me on the grass and sing songs you brought hither from the assembly of the stars , while darkness stooped over the river bank as love droops over its own sad silence ? Were these parts of a cruel conspiracy plotted in your Paradise ? Was all for the sake of access to my father 's heart ?— and after success , were you , departing , to throw some cheap gratitude , like small coins , to the deluded door-keeper ?</p>

     <head>KACHA</head>
     <p>What profit were there , proud woman , in knowing the truth ? If I did wrong to serve you with a passionate devotion cherished in secret , I have had ample punishment . This is no time to question whether my love be true or not ; my life 's work awaits me . Though my heart must henceforth enclose a red flame vainly striving to devour emptiness , still I must go back to that Paradise which will nevermore be Paradise to me . I owe the Gods a new divinity , hard won by my studies , before I may think of happiness . Forgive me , Devayani , and know that my suffering is doubled by the pain I unwillingly inflict on you .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DEVAYANI</head>
      <head>Forgiveness ! You have angered my heart till it is hard and burning like a thunderbolt ! You can go back to your work and your glory , but what is left for me ? Memory is a bed of thorns , and secret shame will gnaw at the roots of my life . You came like a wayfarer , sat through the sunny hours in the shade of my garden , and to while time away you plucked all its flowers and wove them into a chain . And now , parting , you snap the thread and let the flowers drop on the dust ! Accursed be that great knowledge you have earned !— a burden that , though others share equally with you , will never be lightened . For lack of love may it ever remain as foreign to your life as the cold stars are to the un-espoused darkness of virgin Night !</head>

     <p>The season of rains came to an end . The dark clouds became white and thin , and in the rain-washed sky the sunny hours hovered like butterflies over an unseen flower . I was bewildered and asked everybody I met , “ What is that music in the breeze ? ”</p>
     <p>A tramp walked the road whose dress was wild as his manner ; he said , “ Hark to the music of the Coming ! ”</p>
     <p>I cannot tell why I was convinced , but the words broke from me , “ We have not much longer to wait . ”</p>

     <p>August comes laden with rain clouds and my house is desolate .</p>
     <p>The stormy sky growls , the earth is flooded with rain , my love is far away , and my heart is torn with anguish .</p>
     <p>The peacocks dance , for the clouds rumble and frogs croak .</p>

     <p>Lucky was my awakening this morning , for I saw my beloved .</p>
     <p>The sky was one piece of joy , and my life and youth were fulfilled .</p>
     <p>To-day my house becomes my house in truth , and my body my body .</p>
     <p>Fortune has proved a friend , and my doubts are dispelled .</p>
     <p>Birds , sing your best ; moon , shed your fairest light !</p>
     <p>Let fly your darts , Love-God , in millions !</p>
     <p>I wait for the moment when my body will grow golden at his touch .</p>

     <p>3</p>
     <p>I feel my body vanishing into the dust whereon my beloved walks .</p>
     <p>I feel one with the water of the lake where he bathes .</p>
     <p>Oh Sakhi , my love crosses death 's boundary when I meet him .</p>
     <p>My heart melts in the light and merges in the mirror whereby he views his face .</p>
     <p>I move with the air to kiss him when he waves his fan , and wherever he wanders I enclose him like the sky .</p>
     <p>Govindadas says , “ You are the gold-setting , fair maiden , he is the emerald . ”</p>
     <p>4</p>
     <p>My love , I will keep you hidden in my eyes ; I will thread your image like a gem on my joy and hang it on my bosom .</p>
     <p>You have been in my heart ever since I was a child , throughout my youth , throughout my life , even through all my dreams .</p>
     <p>You dwell in my being when I sleep and when I wake .</p>
     <p>Know that I am a woman , and bear with me when you find me wanting .</p>
     <p>For I have thought and thought and know for certain that all that is left for me in this world is your love , and if I lose you for a moment I die .</p>

     <p>Endlessly varied art thou in the exuberant world , Lady of Manifold Magnificence . Thy path is strewn with lights , thy touch thrills into flowers ; that trailing skirt of thine sweeps the whirl of a dance among the stars , and thy many-toned music is echoed from innumerable worlds through signs and colours .</p>
     <p>Single and alone in the unfathomed stillness of the soul , art thou , Lady of Silence and Solitude , a vision thrilled with light , a lonely lotus blossoming on the stem of love .</p>
     <p>2</p>
     <p>Behind the rusty iron gratings of the opposite window sits a girl , dark and plain of face , like a boat stranded on a sand-bank when the river is shallow in the summer .</p>
     <p>I come back to my room after my day 's work , and my tired eyes are lured to her .</p>
     <p>She seems to me like a lake with its dark lonely waters edged by moonlight .</p>
     <p>She has only her window for freedom : there the morning light meets her musings , and through it her dark eyes like lost stars travel back to their sky .</p>
     <p>3</p>
     <p>I remember the day .</p>
     <p>The heavy shower of rain is slackening into fitful pauses , renewed gusts of wind startle it from a first lull .</p>
     <p>I take up my instrument . Idly I touch the strings , till , without my knowing , the music borrows the mad cadence of that storm .</p>
     <p>I see her figure as she steals from her work , stops at my door , and retreats with hesitating steps . She comes again , stands outside leaning against the wall , then slowly enters the room and sits down . With head bent , she plies her needle in silence ; but soon stops her work , and looks out of the window through the rain at the blurred line of trees .</p>
     <p>Only this — one hour of a rainy noon filled with shadows and song and silence .</p>
     <p>4</p>
     <p>While stepping into the carriage she turned her head and threw me a swift glance of farewell .</p>
     <p>This was her last gift to me . But where can I keep it safe from the trampling hours ?</p>
     <p>Must evening sweep this gleam of anguish away , as it will the last flicker of fire from the sunset ?</p>
     <p>Ought it to be washed off by the rain , as treasured pollens are from heart-broken flowers ?</p>
     <p>Leave kingly glory and the wealth of the rich to death . But may not tears keep ever fresh the memory of a glance flung through a passionate moment ?</p>
     <p>“ Give it to me to keep , ” said my song ; “ I never touch kings ’ glory or the wealth of the rich , but these small things are mine for ever . ”</p>
     <p>5</p>
     <p>You give yourself to me , like a flower that blossoms at night , whose presence is known by the dew that drips from it , by the odour shed through the darkness , as the first steps of Spring are by the buds that thicken the twigs .</p>
     <p>You break upon my thought like waves at the high tide , and my heart is drowned under surging songs .</p>
     <p>My heart knew of your coming , as the night feels the approach of dawn . The clouds are aflame and my sky fills with a great revealing flood .</p>
     <p>6</p>
     <p>I was to go away ; still she did not speak . But I felt , from a slight quiver , her yearning arms would say : “ Ah no , not yet . ”</p>
     <p>I have often heard her pleading hands vocal in a touch , though they knew not what they said .</p>
     <p>I have known those arms to stammer when , had they not , they would have become youth 's garland round my neck .</p>
     <p>Their little gestures return to remembrance in the covert of still hours , like truants they playfully reveal things she had kept secret from me .</p>
     <p>7</p>
     <p>My songs are like bees ; they follow through the air some fragrant trace — some memory — of you , to hum around your shyness , eager for its hidden store .</p>
     <p>When the freshness of dawn droops in the sun , when in the noon the air hangs low with heaviness and the forest is silent , my songs return home , their languid wings dusted with gold .</p>
     <p>8</p>
     <p>I believe you had visited me in a vision before we ever met , like some foretaste of April before the spring broke into flower .</p>
     <p>That vision must have come when all was bathed in the odour of sal blossom ; when the twilight twinkle of the river fringed its yellow sands , and the vague sounds of a summer afternoon were blended ; yes , and had it not laughed and evaded me in many a nameless gleam at other moments ?</p>
     <p>9</p>
     <p>I think I shall stop startled if ever we meet after our next birth , walking in the light of a far-away world .</p>
     <p>I shall know those dark eyes then as morning stars , and yet feel that they have belonged to some unremembered evening sky of a former life .</p>
     <p>I shall know that the magic of your face is not all its own , but has stolen the passionate light that was in my eyes at some immemorial meeting , and then gathered from my love a mystery that has now forgotten its origin .</p>
     <p>10</p>
     <p>Lay down your lute , my love , leave your arms free to embrace me .</p>
     <p>Let your touch bring my overflowing heart to my body 's utmost brink .</p>
     <p>Do not bend your neck and turn away your face , but offer up a kiss to me , which has been like some perfume long closed in a bud .</p>
     <p>Do not smother this moment under vain words , but let our hearts quake in a rush of silence sweeping all thoughts to the shoreless delight .</p>
     <p>11</p>
     <p>You have made me great with your love , though I am but one among the many , drifting in the common tide , rocking in the fluctuant favour of the world .</p>
     <p>You have given me a seat where poets of all time bring their tribute , and lovers with deathless names greet one another across the ages .</p>
     <p>Men hastily pass me in the market ,— never noting how my body has grown precious with your caress , how I carry your kiss within , as the sun carries in its orb the fire of the divine touch and shines for ever .</p>
     <p>12</p>
     <p>Like a child that frets and pushes away its toys , my heart to-day shakes its head at every phrase I suggest , and says , “ No , not this . ”</p>
     <p>Yet words , in the agony of their vagueness , haunt my mind , like vagrant clouds hovering over hills , waiting for some chance wind to relieve them of their rain .</p>
     <p>But leave these vain efforts , my soul , for the stillness will ripen its own music in the dark .</p>
     <p>My life to-day is like a cloister during some penance , where the spring is afraid to stir or to whisper .</p>
     <p>This is not the time , my love , for you to pass the gate ; at the mere thought of your anklet bells tinkling down the path , the garden echoes are ashamed .</p>
     <p>Know that to-morrow 's songs are in bud to-day , and should they see you walk by they would strain to breaking their immature hearts .</p>
     <p>13</p>
     <p>Whence do you bring this disquiet , my love ?</p>
     <p>Let my heart touch yours and kiss the pain out of your silence .</p>
     <p>The night has thrown up from its depth this little hour , that love may build a new world within these shut doors , to be lighted by this solitary lamp .</p>
     <p>We have for music but a single reed which our two pairs of lips must play on by turns — for crown , only one garland to bind my hair after I have put it on your forehead .</p>
     <p>Tearing the veil from my breast I shall make our bed on the floor ; and one kiss and one sleep of delight shall fill our small boundless world .</p>
     <p>14</p>
     <p>All that I had I gave to you , keeping but the barest veil of reserve .</p>
     <p>It is so thin that you secretly smile at it and I feel ashamed .</p>
     <p>The gust of the spring breeze sweeps it away unawares , and the flutter of my own heart moves it as the waves move their foam .</p>
     <p>My love , do not grieve if I keep this flimsy mist of distance round me .</p>
     <p>This frail reserve of mine is no mere woman 's coyness , but a slender stem on which the flower of my self-surrender bends towards you with reticent grace .</p>
     <p>15</p>
     <p>I have donned this new robe to-day because my body feels like singing .</p>
     <p>It is not enough that I am given to my love once and for ever , but out of that I must fashion new gifts every day ; and shall I not seem a fresh offering , dressed in a new robe ?</p>
     <p>My heart , like the evening sky , has its endless passion for colour , and therefore I change my veils , which have now the green of the cool young grass and now that of the winter rice .</p>
     <p>To-day my robe is tinted with the rain-rimmed blue of the sky . It brings to my limbs the colour of the boundless , the colour of the oversea hills ; and it carries in its folds the delight of summer clouds flying in the wind .</p>
     <p>16</p>
     <p>I thought I would write love 's words in their own colour ; but that lies deep in the heart , and tears are pale .</p>
     <p>Would you know them , friend , if the words were colourless ?</p>
     <p>I thought I would sing love 's words to their own tune , but that sounds only in my heart , and my eyes are silent .</p>
     <p>Would you know them , friend , if there were no tune ?</p>
     <p>17</p>
     <p>In the night the song came to me ; but you were not there .</p>
     <p>It found the words for which I had been seeking all day . Yes , in the stillness a moment after dark they throbbed into music , even as the stars then began to pulse with light ; but you were not there . My hope was to sing it to you in the morning ; but , try as I might , though the music came , the words hung back , when you were beside me .</p>
     <p>18</p>
     <p>The night deepens and the dying flame flickers in the lamp .</p>
     <p>I forgot to notice when the evening — like a village girl who has filled her pitcher at the river a last time for that day — closed the door on her cabin .</p>
     <p>I was speaking to you , my love , with mind barely conscious of my voice — tell me , had it any meaning ? Did it bring you any message from beyond life 's borders ?</p>
     <p>For now , since my voice has ceased , I feel the night throbbing with thoughts that gaze in awe at the abyss of their dumbness .</p>
     <p>19</p>
     <p>When we two first met my heart rang out in music , “ She who is eternally afar is beside you for ever . ”</p>
     <p>That music is silent , because I have grown to believe that my love is only near , and have forgotten that she is also far , far away .</p>
     <p>Music fills the infinite between two souls . This has been muffled by the mist of our daily habits .</p>
     <p>On shy summer nights , when the breeze brings a vast murmur out of the silence , I sit up in my bed and mourn the great loss of her who is beside me . I ask myself , “ When shall I have another chance to whisper to her words with the rhythm of eternity in them ? ”</p>
     <p>Wake up , my song , from thy languor , rend this screen of the familiar , and fly to my beloved there , in the endless surprise of our first meeting !</p>
     <p>20</p>
     <p>Lovers come to you , my Queen , and proudly lay their riches at your feet : but my tribute is made up of unfulfilled hopes .</p>
     <p>Shadows have stolen across the heart of my world and the best in me has lost light .</p>
     <p>While the fortunate laugh at my penury , I ask you to lend my failings your tears , and so make them precious .</p>
     <p>I bring you a voiceless instrument .</p>
     <p>I strained to reach a note which was too high in my heart , and the string broke .</p>
     <p>While masters laugh at the snapped cord , I ask you to take my lute in your hands and fill its hollowness with your songs .</p>

     <p>The father came back from the funeral rites .</p>
     <p>His boy of seven stood at the window , with eyes wide open and a golden amulet hanging from his neck , full of thoughts too difficult for his age .</p>
     <p>His father took him in his arms and the boy asked him , “ Where is mother ? ”</p>
     <p>“ In heaven , ” answered his father , pointing to the sky .</p>
     <p>At night the father groaned in slumber , weary with grief .</p>
     <p>A lamp dimly burned near the bedroom door , and a lizard chased moths on the wall .</p>
     <p>The boy woke up from sleep , felt with his hands the emptiness in the bed , and stole out to the open terrace .</p>
     <p>The boy raised his eyes to the sky and long gazed in silence . His bewildered mind sent abroad into the night the question , “ Where is heaven ? ”</p>
     <p>No answer came : and the stars seemed like the burning tears of that ignorant darkness .</p>
     <p>22</p>
     <p>She went away when the night was about to wane .</p>
     <p>My mind tried to console me by saying , “ All is vanity . ”</p>
     <p>I felt angry and said , “ That unopened letter with her name on it , and this palm-leaf fan bordered with red silk by her own hands , are they not real ? ”</p>
     <p>The day passed , and my friend came and said to me , “ Whatever is good is true , and can never perish . ”</p>
     <p>“ How do you know ? ” I asked impatiently ; “ was not this body good which is now lost to the world ? ”</p>
     <p>As a fretful child hurting its own mother , I tried to wreck all the shelters that ever I had , in and about me , and cried , “ This world is treacherous . ”</p>
     <p>Suddenly I felt a voice saying — “ Ungrateful ! ”</p>
     <p>I looked out of the window , and a reproach seemed to come from the star-sprinkled night ,— “ You pour out into the void of my absence your faith in the truth that I came ! ”</p>
     <p>23</p>
     <p>The river is grey and the air dazed with blown sand .</p>
     <p>On a morning of dark disquiet , when the birds are mute and their nests shake in the gust , I sit alone and ask myself , “ Where is she ? ”</p>
     <p>The days have flown wherein we sat too near each other ; we laughed and jested , and the awe of love 's majesty found no words at our meetings .</p>
     <p>I made myself small , and she trifled away every moment with pelting talk .</p>
     <p>To-day I wish in vain that she were by me , in the gloom of the coming storm , to sit in the soul 's solitude .</p>
     <p>24</p>
     <p>The name she called me by , like a flourishing jasmine , covered the whole seventeen years of our love . With its sound mingled the quiver of the light through the leaves , the scent of the grass in the rainy night , and the sad silence of the last hour of many an idle day .</p>
     <p>Not the work of God alone was he who answered to that name ; she created him again for herself during those seventeen swift years .</p>
     <p>Other years were to follow , but their vagrant days , no longer gathered within the fold of that name uttered in her voice , stray and are scattered .</p>
     <p>They ask me , “ Who should fold us ? ”</p>
     <p>I find no answer and sit silent , and they cry to me while dispersing , “ We seek a shepherdess ! ”</p>
     <p>Whom should they seek ?</p>
     <p>That they do not know . And like derelict evening clouds they drift in the trackless dark , and are lost and forgotten .</p>
     <p>25</p>
     <p>I feel that your brief days of love have not been left behind in those scanty years of your life .</p>
     <p>I seek to know in what place , away from the slow-thieving dust , you keep them now . I find in my solitude some song of your evening that died , yet left a deathless echo ; and the sighs of your unsatisfied hours I find nestled in the warm quiet of the autumn noon .</p>
     <p>Your desires come from the hive of the past to haunt my heart , and I sit still to listen to their wings .</p>
     <p>26</p>
     <p>You have taken a bath in the dark sea . You are once again veiled in a bride 's robe , and through death 's arch you come back to repeat our wedding in the soul .</p>
     <p>Neither lute nor drum is struck , no crowd has gathered , not a wreath is hung on the gate .</p>
     <p>Your unuttered words meet mine in a ritual unillumined by lamps .</p>
     <p>27</p>
     <p>I was walking along a path overgrown with grass , when suddenly I heard from some one behind , “ See if you know me ? ”</p>
     <p>I turned round and looked at her and said , “ I cannot remember your name . ”</p>
     <p>She said , “ I am that first great Sorrow whom you met when you were young . ”</p>
     <p>Her eyes looked like a morning whose dew is still in the air .</p>
     <p>I stood silent for some time till I said , “ Have you lost all the great burden of your tears ? ”</p>
     <p>She smiled and said nothing . I felt that her tears had had time to learn the language of smiles .</p>
     <p>“ Once you said , ” she whispered , “ that you would cherish your grief for ever . ”</p>
     <p>I blushed and said , “ Yes , but years have passed and I forget . ”</p>
     <p>Then I took her hand in mine and said , “ But you have changed . ”</p>
     <p>“ What was sorrow once has now become peace , ” she said .</p>
     <p>28</p>
     <p>Our life sails on the uncrossed sea whose waves chase each other in an eternal hide-and-seek .</p>
     <p>It is the restless sea of change , feeding its foaming flocks to lose them over and over again , beating its hands against the calm of the sky .</p>
     <p>Love , in the centre of this circling war-dance of light and dark , yours is that green island , where the sun kisses the shy forest shade and silence is wooed by birds ’ singing .</p>

       <l n="1">Night on the battlefield : AMA meets her father VINAYAKA .</l>

      <head>VINAYAKA</head>
       <l n="1">Shameless wanton , you call me “ Father ” ! you who did not shrink from a</l>
       <l n="2">Mussulman husband !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>AMA</p>
     <p>Though you have treacherously killed my husband , yet you are my father ; and I hold back a widow 's tears , lest they bring God 's curse on you . Since we have met on this battlefield after years of separation , let me bow to your feet and take my last leave !</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>VINAYAKA</head>
       <l n="1">Where will you go , Ama ? The tree on which you built your impious nest is</l>
       <l n="2">hewn down . Where will you take shelter ?</l>

       <l n="1">I have my son .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>VINAYAKA</head>
       <l n="1">Leave him ! Cast never a fond look back on the result of a sin expiated with</l>

       <l n="1">Death 's open gates are wider than a father 's love !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>VINAYAKA</p>
     <p>Death indeed swallows sins as the sea swallows the mud of rivers . But you are to die neither to-night nor here . Seek some solitary shrine of holy Shiva far from shamed kindred and all neighbours ; bathe three times a day in sacred Ganges , and , while reciting God 's name , listen to the last bell of evening worship , that Death may look tenderly upon you , as a father on his sleeping child whose eyes are still wet with tears . Let him gently carry you into his own great silence , as the Ganges carries a fallen flower on its stream , washing every stain away to render it , a fit offering , to the sea .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>AMA</head>
       <l n="1">But my son ——</l>
     </lg>
     <p>VINAYAKA</p>
     <p>Again I bid you not to speak of him . Lay yourself once more in a father 's arms , my child , like a babe fresh from the womb of Oblivion , your second mother .</p>
     <p>AMA</p>
     <p>To me the world has become a shadow . Your words I hear , but cannot take to heart . Leave me , father , leave me alone ! Do not try to bind me with your love , for its bands are red with my husband 's blood .</p>
     <p>VINAYAKA</p>
     <p>Alas ! no flower ever returns to the parent branch it dropped from . How can you call him husband who forcibly snatched you from Jivaji to whom you had been sacredly affianced ? I shall never forget that night ! In the wedding hall we sat anxiously expecting the bridegroom , for the auspicious hour was dwindling away . Then in the distance appeared the glare of torches , and bridal strains came floating up the air . We shouted for joy : women blew their conch-shells . A procession of palanquins entered the courtyard : but while we were asking , “ Where is Jivaji ? ” armed men burst out of the litters like a storm , and bore you off before we knew what had happened . Shortly after , Jivaji came to tell us he had been waylaid and captured by a Mussulman noble of the Vijapur court . That night Jivaji and I touched the nuptial fire and swore bloody death to this villain . After waiting long , we have been freed from our solemn pledge to-night ; and the spirit of Jivaji , who lost his life in this battle , lawfully claims you for wife .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>AMA</head>
      <head>Father , it may be that I have disgraced the rites of your house , but my honour is unsullied ; I loved him to whom I bore a son . I remember the night when I received two secret messages , one from you , one from my mother ; yours said : “ I send you the knife ; kill him ! ” My mother 's : “ I send you the poison ; end your life ! ” Had unholy force dishonoured me , your double bidding had been obeyed . But my body was yielded only after love had given me — love all the greater , all the purer , in that it overcame the hereditary recoil of our blood from the Mussulman .</head>

     <p>RAMA</p>
     <p>Yes , Jivaji . He was your husband by plighted troth . The baffled fire of the nuptial God has raged into the hungry fire of death , and the interrupted wedding shall be completed now .</p>
     <p>VINAYAKA</p>
     <p>Do not listen , my child . Go back to your son , to your own nest darkened with sorrow . My duty has been performed to its extreme cruel end , and nothing now remains for you to do .— Wife , your grief is fruitless . Were the branch dead which was violently snapped from our tree , I should give it to the fire . But it has sent living roots into a new soil and is bearing flowers and fruits . Allow her , without regret , to obey the laws of those among whom she has loved . Come , wife , it is time we cut all worldly ties and spent our remainder lives in the seclusion of some peaceful pilgrim shrine .</p>
     <p>RAMA</p>
     <p>I am ready : but first must tread into dust every sprout of sin and shame that has sprung from the soil of our life . A daughter 's infamy stains her mother 's honour . That black shame shall feed glowing fire to-night , and raise a true wife 's memorial over the ashes of my daughter .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>AMA</head>
      <head>Mother , if by force you unite me in death with one who was not my husband , then will you bring a curse upon yourself for desecrating the shrine of the Eternal Lord of Death .</head>

     <p>A painter was selling pictures at the fair ; followed by servants , there passed the son of a minister who in youth had cheated this painter 's father so that he had died of a broken heart .</p>
     <p>The boy lingered before the pictures and chose one for himself . The painter flung a cloth over it and said he would not sell it .</p>
     <p>After this the boy pined heart-sick till his father came and offered a large price . But the painter kept the picture unsold on his shop-wall and grimly sat before it , saying to himself , “ This is my revenge . ”</p>
     <p>The sole form this painter 's worship took was to trace an image of his god every morning .</p>
     <p>And now he felt these pictures grow daily more different from those he used to paint .</p>
     <p>This troubled him , and he sought in vain for an explanation till one day he started up from work in horror , the eyes of the god he had just drawn were those of the minister , and so were the lips .</p>
     <p>He tore up the picture , crying , “ My revenge has returned on my head ! ”</p>
     <p>31</p>
     <p>The General came before the silent and angry King and saluting him said : “ The village is punished , the men are stricken to dust , and the women cower in their unlit homes afraid to weep aloud . ”</p>
     <p>The High Priest stood up and blessed the King and cried : “ God 's mercy is ever upon you . ”</p>

      <head>THE MOTHER 'S PRAYER</head>
      <head>Prince Duryodhana , the son of the blind Kaurava King Dhritarashtra , and of Queen Gandhari , has played with his cousins the Pandava Kings for their kingdom , and won it by fraud .</head>
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">You have compassed your end .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DURYODHANA</head>
       <l n="1">Success is mine !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">Are you happy ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DURYODHANA</head>
       <l n="1">I am victorious .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">I ask you again , what happiness have you in winning the undivided kingdom ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>DURYODHANA</p>
     <p>Sire , a Kshatriya thirsts not after happiness but victory , that fiery wine pressed from seething jealousy . Wretchedly happy we were , like those inglorious stains that lie idly on the breast of the moon , when we lived in peace under the friendly dominance of our cousins . Then these Pandavas milked the world of its wealth , and allowed us a share , in brotherly tolerance . Now that they own defeat and expect banishment , I am no longer happy but exultant .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">Wretch , you forget that both Pandavas and Kauravas have the same</l>
       <l n="2">forefathers .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>DURYODHANA</p>
     <p>It was difficult to forget that , and therefore our inequalities rankled in my heart . At midnight the moon is never jealous of the noonday sun . But the struggle to share one horizon between both orbs cannot last forever . Thank heaven , that struggle is over , and we have at last won solitude in glory .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">The mean jealousy !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>DURYODHANA</p>
     <p>Jealousy is never mean — it is in the essence of greatness . Grass can grow in crowded amity , not giant trees . Stars live in clusters , but the sun and moon are lonely in their splendour . The pale moon of the Pandavas sets behind the forest shadows , leaving the new-risen sun of the Kauravas to rejoice .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">But right has been defeated .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>DURYODHANA</p>
     <p>Right for rulers is not what is right in the eyes of the people . The people thrive by comradeship : but for a king , equals are enemies . They are obstacles ahead , they are terrors from behind . There is no place for brothers or friends in a king 's polity ; its one solid foundation is conquest .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">I refuse to call a conquest what was won by fraud in gambling .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DURYODHANA</head>
      <head>A man is not shamed by refusing to challenge a tiger on equal terms with teeth and nails . Our weapons are those proper for success , not for suicide . Father , I am proud of the result and disdain regret for the means .</head>
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">But justice ——</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DURYODHANA</head>
       <l n="1">Fools alone dream of justice — success is not yet theirs : but those born to</l>
       <l n="2">rule rely on power , merciless and unhampered with scruples .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">Your success will bring down on you a loud and angry flood of detraction .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DURYODHANA</head>
       <l n="1">The people will take amazingly little time to learn that Duryodhana is king</l>
       <l n="2">and has power to crush calumny under foot .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
       <l n="1">Calumny dies of weariness dancing on tongue-tips . Do not drive it into the</l>
       <l n="2">heart to gather strength .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>DURYODHANA</p>
     <p>Unuttered defamation does not touch a king 's dignity . I care not if love is refused us , but insolence shall not be borne . Love depends upon the will of the giver , and the poorest of the poor can indulge in such generosity . Let them squander it on their pet cats , tame dogs , and our good cousins the Pandavas . I shall never envy them . Fear is the tribute I claim for my royal throne . Father , only too leniently you lent your ear to those who slandered your sons : but if you intend still to allow those pious friends of yours to revel in shrill denunciation at the expense of your children , let us exchange our kingdom for the exile of our cousins , and go to the wilderness , where happily friends are never cheap !</p>

      <head>DHRITARASHTRA</head>
      <head>Could the pious warnings of my friends lessen my love for my sons , then we might be saved . But I have dipped my hands in the mire of your infamy and lost my sense of goodness . For your sakes I have heedlessly set fire to the ancient forest of our royal lineage — so dire is my love . Clasped breast to breast , we , like a double meteor , are blindly plunging into ruin . Therefore doubt not my love ; relax not your embrace till the brink of annihilation be reached . Beat your drums of victory , lift your banner of triumph . In this mad riot of exultant evil , brothers and friends will disperse till nothing remain save the doomed father , the doomed son and God 's curse .</head>

     <p>New afflictions . Pleasure in our son 's presence , pride in a new kingdom , and shame at knowing both purchased by wrong done or connived at , like thorns dragged two ways , would lacerate our bosoms . The Pandavas are too proud ever to accept back from us the lands which they have relinquished ; therefore it is only meet that we draw some great sorrow down on our heads so as to deprive that unmerited reward of its sting .</p>

       <l n="1">Queen , you inflict fresh pain on a heart already rent .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GANDHARI</p>
     <p>Sire , the punishment imposed on our son will be more ours than his . A judge callous to the pain that he inflicts loses the right to judge . And if you spare your son to save yourself pain , then all the culprits ever punished by your hands will cry before God 's throne for vengeance ,— had they not also their fathers ?</p>
     <p>DHRITARASHTRA</p>
     <p>No more of this , Queen , I pray you . Our son is abandoned of God : that is why I cannot give him up . To save him is no longer in my power , and therefore my consolation is to share his guilt and tread the path of destruction , his solitary companion . What is done is done ; let follow what must follow ! [ Exit .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>GANDHARI</head>
      <head>Be calm , my heart , and patiently await God 's judgment . Oblivious night wears on , the morning of reckoning nears , I hear the thundering roar of its chariot . Woman , bow your head down to the dust ! and as a sacrifice fling your heart under those wheels ! Darkness will shroud the sky , earth will tremble , wailing will rend the air and then comes the silent and cruel end ,— that terrible peace , that great forgetting , and awful extinction of hatred — the supreme deliverance rising from the fire of death .</head>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The great preparations of love lie a heap of shreds , and there is nothing on the ruined altar to remind the mad crowd that their god was to have come . In a fury of passion they seem to have burnt their future to cinders , and with it the season of their bloom .</p>
     <p>The air is harsh with the cry , “ Victory to the Brute ! ” The children look haggard and aged ; they whisper to one another that time revolves but never advances , that we are goaded to run but have nothing to reach , that creation is like a blind man 's groping .</p>
     <p>I said to myself , “ Cease thy singing . Song is for one who is to come , the struggle without an end is for things that are . ”</p>
     <p>The road , that ever lies along like some one with ear to the ground listening for footsteps , to-day gleans no hint of coming guest , nothing of the house at its far end .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>The sky stooped over the horizon to whisper to the earth , and a hush of expectation filled the air . I saw the palm leaves clapping their hands to the beat of inaudible music , and the moon exchanged glances with the glistening silence of the lake .</p>
     <p>The road said to me , “ Fear nothing ! ” and my lute said , “ Lend me thy songs ! ”</p>

     <p>In love the aim is neither pain nor pleasure but love only .</p>
     <p>While free love binds , division destroys it , for love is what unites .</p>

     <p>In your being it leaps under the rod of pain .</p>
     <p>Then , when the hidden fire flames forth , the in and the out are one and all barriers fall in ashes .</p>
     <p>Let the pain glow fiercely , burst from the heart and beat back darkness , need you be afraid ?</p>

     <p>My master 's flute sounds through all things , drawing me out of my lodgings wherever they may be , and while I listen I know that every step I take is in my master 's house .</p>

     <p>Strange ways has my guest .</p>
     <p>He comes at times when I am unprepared , yet how can I refuse him ?</p>
     <p>I watch all night with lighted lamp ; he stays away ; when the light goes out and the room is bare he comes claiming his seat , and can I keep him waiting ?</p>
     <p>I laugh and make merry with friends , then suddenly I start up , for lo ! he passes me by in sorrow , and I know my mirth was vain .</p>
     <p>I have often seen a smile in his eyes when my heart ached , then I knew my sorrow was not real .</p>
     <p>Yet I never complain when I do not understand him .</p>
     <p>8</p>
     <p>I am the boat , you are the sea , and also the boatman .</p>
     <p>Though you never make the shore , though you let me sink , why should I be foolish and afraid ?</p>
     <p>Is reaching the shore a greater prize than losing myself with you ?</p>
     <p>If you are only the haven , as they say , then what is the sea ?</p>
     <p>Let it surge and toss me on its waves , I shall be content .</p>
     <p>I live in you whatever and however you appear . Save me or kill me as you wish , only never leave me in other hands .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Burst , like a rebellion of light , through the night 's vigil , through the lake 's dark dumbness , through the dungeon under the dust , proclaiming freedom to the shackled seeds !</p>
     <p>Like the laughter of lightning , like the shout of a storm , break into the midst of the noisy town ; free stifled word and unconscious effort , reinforce our flagging fight , and conquer death !</p>
     <p>2</p>
     <p>I have looked on this picture in many a month of March when the mustard is in bloom — this lazy line of the water and the grey of the sand beyond , the rough path along the river-bank carrying the comradeship of the field into the heart of the village .</p>
     <p>I have tried to capture in rhyme the idle whistle of the wind , the beat of the oar-strokes from a passing boat .</p>
     <p>I have wondered in my mind how simply it stands before me , this great world : with what fond and familiar ease it fills my heart , this encounter with the Eternal Stranger .</p>
     <p>3</p>
     <p>The ferry-boat plies between the two villages facing each other across the narrow stream .</p>
     <p>The water is neither wide nor deep — a mere break in the path that enhances the small adventures of daily life , like a break in the words of a song across which the tune gleefully streams .</p>
     <p>While the towers of wealth rise high and crash to ruin , these villages talk to each other across the garrulous stream , and the ferry-boat plies between them , age after age , from seed-time to harvest .</p>
     <p>4</p>
     <p>In the evening after they have brought their cattle home , they sit on the grass before their huts to know that you are among them unseen , to repeat in their songs the name which they have fondly given you .</p>
     <p>While kings ’ crowns shine and disappear like falling stars , around village huts your name rises through the still night from the simple hearts of your lovers whose names are unrecorded .</p>
     <p>5</p>
     <p>In Baby 's world , the trees shake their leaves at him , murmuring verses in an ancient tongue that dates from before the age of meaning , and the moon feigns to be of his own age — the solitary baby of night .</p>
     <p>In the world of the old , flowers dutifully blush at the make-believe of faery legends , and broken dolls confess that they are made of clay .</p>
     <p>6</p>
     <p>My world , when I was a child , you were a little girl-neighbour , a loving timid stranger .</p>
     <p>Then you grew bold and talked to me across the fence , offering me toys and flowers and shells .</p>
     <p>Next you coaxed me away from my work , you tempted me into the land of the dusk or the weedy corner of some garden in mid-day loneliness .</p>
     <p>At length you told me stories about bygone times , with which the present ever longs to meet so as to be rescued from its prison in the moment .</p>
     <p>7</p>
     <p>How often , great Earth , have I felt my being yearn to flow over you , sharing in the happiness of each green blade that raises its signal banner in answer to the beckoning blue of the sky !</p>
     <p>I feel as if I had belonged to you ages before I was born . That is why , in the days when the autumn light shimmers on the mellowing ears of rice , I seem to remember a past when my mind was everywhere , and even to hear voices as of playfellows echoing from the remote and deeply veiled past .</p>
     <p>When , in the evening , the cattle return to their folds , raising dust from the meadow paths , as the moon rises higher than the smoke ascending from the village huts , I feel sad as for some great separation that happened in the first morning of existence .</p>
     <p>8</p>
     <p>My mind still buzzed with the cares of a busy day ; I sat on without noting how twilight was deepening into dark . Suddenly light stirred across the gloom and touched me as with a finger .</p>
     <p>I lifted my head and met the gaze of the full moon widened in wonder like a child 's . It held my eyes for long , and I felt as though a love-letter had been secretly dropped in at my window . And ever since my heart is breaking to write for answer something fragrant as Night 's unseen flowers — great as her declaration spelt out in nameless stars .</p>
     <p>9</p>
     <p>The clouds thicken till the morning light seems like a bedraggled fringe to the rainy night .</p>
     <p>A little girl stands at her window , still as a rainbow at the gate of a broken-down storm .</p>
     <p>She is my neighbour , and has come upon the earth like some god 's rebellious laughter . Her mother in anger calls her incorrigible ; her father smiles and calls her mad .</p>
     <p>She is like a runaway waterfall leaping over boulders , like the topmost bamboo twig rustling in the restless wind .</p>
     <p>She stands at her window looking out into the sky .</p>
     <p>Her sister comes to say , “ Mother calls you . ” She shakes her head .</p>
     <p>Her little brother with his toy boat comes and tries to pull her off to play ; she snatches her hand from his . The boy persists and she gives him a slap on the back .</p>
     <p>The first great voice was the voice of wind and water in the beginning of earth 's creation .</p>
     <p>That ancient cry of nature — her dumb call to unborn life — has reached this child 's heart and leads it out alone beyond the fence of our times : so there she stands , possessed by eternity !</p>
     <p>10</p>
     <p>The kingfisher sits still on the prow of an empty boat , while in the shallow margin of the stream a buffalo lies tranquilly blissful , its eyes half closed to savour the luxury of cool mud .</p>
     <p>Undismayed by the barking of the village cur , the cow browses on the bank , followed by a hopping group of saliks hunting moths .</p>
     <p>I sit in the tamarind grove , where the cries of dumb life congregate — the cattle 's lowing , the sparrows ’ chatter , the shrill scream of a kite overhead , the crickets ’ chirp , and the splash of a fish in the water .</p>
     <p>I peep into the primeval nursery of life , where the mother Earth thrills at the first living clutch near her breast .</p>
     <p>11</p>
     <p>At the sleepy village the noon was still like a sunny midnight when my holidays came to their end .</p>
     <p>My little girl of four had followed me all the morning from room to room , watching my preparations in grave silence , till , wearied , she sat by the doorpost strangely quiet , murmuring to herself , “ Father must not go ! ”</p>
     <p>This was the meal hour , when sleep daily overcame her , but her mother had forgotten her and the child was too unhappy to complain .</p>
     <p>At last , when I stretched out my arms to her to say farewell , she never moved , but sadly looking at me said , “ Father , you must not go ! ”</p>
     <p>And it amused me to tears to think how this little child dared to fight the giant world of necessity with no other resource than those few words , “ Father , you must not go ! ”</p>
     <p>12</p>
     <p>Take your holiday , my boy ; there are the blue sky and the bare field , the barn and the ruined temple under the ancient tamarind .</p>
     <p>My holiday must be taken through yours , finding light in the dance of your eyes , music in your noisy shouts .</p>
     <p>To you autumn brings the true holiday freedom : to me it brings the impossibility of work ; for lo ! you burst into my room .</p>
     <p>Yes , my holiday is an endless freedom for love to disturb me .</p>
     <p>13</p>
     <p>In the evening my little daughter heard a call from her companions below the window .</p>
     <p>She timidly went down the dark stairs holding a lamp in her hand , shielding it behind her veil .</p>
     <p>I was sitting on my terrace in the star-lit night of March , when at a sudden cry I ran to see .</p>
     <p>Her lamp had gone out in the dark spiral staircase . I asked , “ Child , why did you cry ? ”</p>
     <p>From below she answered in distress , “ Father , I have lost myself ! ”</p>
     <p>When I came back to the terrace under the star-lit night of March , I looked at the sky , and it seemed that a child was walking there treasuring many lamps behind her veils .</p>
     <p>If their light went out , she would suddenly stop and a cry would sound from sky to sky , “ Father , I have lost myself ! ”</p>
     <p>14</p>
     <p>The evening stood bewildered among street lamps , its gold tarnished by the city dust .</p>
     <p>A woman , gaudily decked and painted , leant over the rail of her balcony , a living fire waiting for its moths .</p>
     <p>Suddenly an eddy was formed in the road round a street-boy crushed under the wheels of a carriage , and the woman on the balcony fell to the floor screaming in agony , stricken with the grief of the great white-robed Mother who sits in the world 's inner shrine .</p>
     <p>15</p>
     <p>I remember the scene on the barren heath — a girl sat alone on the grass before the gipsy camp , braiding her hair in the afternoon shade .</p>
     <p>Her little dog jumped and barked at her busy hands , as though her employment had no importance .</p>
     <p>In vain did she rebuke it , calling it “ a pest , ” saying she was tired of its perpetual silliness .</p>
     <p>She struck it on the nose with her reproving forefinger , which only seemed to delight it the more .</p>
     <p>She looked menacingly grave for a few moments , to warn it of impending doom ; and then , letting her hair fall , quickly snatched it up in her arms , laughed , and pressed it to her heart .</p>
     <p>16</p>
     <p>He is tall and lean , withered to the bone with long repeated fever , like a dead tree unable to draw a single drop of sap from anywhere .</p>
     <p>In despairing patience , his mother carries him like a child into the sun , where he sits by the roadside in the shortening shadows of each forenoon .</p>
     <p>The world passes by — a woman to fetch water , a herd-boy with cattle to pasture , a laden cart to the distant market — and the mother hopes that some least stir of life may touch the awful torpor of her dying son .</p>
     <p>17</p>
     <p>If the ragged villager , trudging home from the market , could suddenly be lifted to the crest of a distant age , men would stop in their work and shout and run to him in delight .</p>
     <p>For they would no longer whittle down the man into the peasant , but find him full of the mystery and spirit of his age .</p>
     <p>Even his poverty and pain would grow great , released from the shallow insult of the present , and the paltry things in his basket would acquire pathetic dignity .</p>
     <p>18</p>
     <p>With the morning he came out to walk a road shaded by a file of deodars , that coiled the hill round like importunate love .</p>
     <p>He held the first letter from his newly wedded wife in their village home , begging him to come to her , and come soon .</p>
     <p>The touch of an absent hand haunted him as he walked , and the air seemed to take up the cry of the letter : “ Love , my love , my sky is brimming with tears ! ”</p>
     <p>He asked himself in wonder , “ How do I deserve this ? ”</p>
     <p>The sun suddenly appeared over the rim of the blue hills , and four girls from a foreign shore came with swift strides , talking loud and followed by a barking dog .</p>
     <p>The two elder turned away to conceal their amusement at something strange in his insignificance , and the younger ones pushed each other , laughed aloud , and ran off in exuberant mirth .</p>
     <p>He stopped and his head sank . Then he suddenly felt his letter , opened and read it again .</p>
     <p>19</p>
     <p>The day came for the image from the temple to be drawn round the holy town in its chariot .</p>
     <p>The Queen said to the King , “ Let us go and attend the festival . ”</p>
     <p>Only one man out of the whole household did not join in the pilgrimage . His work was to collect stalks of spear-grass to make brooms for the King 's house .</p>
     <p>The chief of the servants said in pity to him , “ You may come with us . ”</p>
     <p>He bowed his head , saying , “ It cannot be . ”</p>
     <p>The man dwelt by the road along which the King 's followers had to pass . And when the Minister 's elephant reached this spot , he called to him and said , “ Come with us and see the God ride in his chariot ! ”</p>
     <p>“ I dare not seek God after the King 's fashion , ” said the man .</p>
     <p>“ How should you ever have such luck again as to see the God in his chariot ? ” asked the Minister .</p>
     <p>“ When God himself comes to my door , ” answered the man .</p>
     <p>The Minister laughed loud and said , “ Fool ! ‘ When God comes to your door ! ’ yet a King must travel to see him ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Who except God visits the poor ? ” said the man .</p>
     <p>20</p>
     <p>Days were drawing out as the winter ended , and , in the sun , my dog played in his wild way with the pet deer .</p>
     <p>The crowd going to the market gathered by the fence , and laughed to see the love of these playmates struggle with languages so dissimilar .</p>
     <p>The spring was in the air , and the young leaves fluttered like flames . A gleam danced in the deer 's dark eyes when she started , bent her neck at the movement of her own shadow , or raised her ears to listen to some whisper in the wind .</p>
     <p>The message comes floating with the errant breeze , with the rustle and glimmer abroad in the April sky . It sings of the first ache of youth in the world , when the first flower broke from the bud , and love went forth seeking that which it knew not , leaving all it had known .</p>
     <p>And one afternoon , when among the amlak trees the shadow grew grave and sweet with the furtive caress of light , the deer set off to run like a meteor in love with death .</p>
     <p>It grew dark , and lamps were lighted in the house ; the stars came out and night was upon the fields , but the deer never came back .</p>
     <p>My dog ran up to me whining , questioning me with his piteous eyes which seemed to say , “ I do not understand ! ”</p>
     <p>But who does ever understand ?</p>
     <p>21</p>
     <p>Our Lane is tortuous , as if , ages ago , she started in quest of her goal , vacillated right and left , and remained bewildered for ever .</p>
     <p>Above in the air , between her buildings , hangs like a ribbon a strip torn out of space : she calls it her sister of the blue town .</p>
     <p>She sees the sun only for a few moments at mid-day , and asks herself in wise doubt , “ Is it real ? ”</p>
     <p>In June rain sometimes shades her band of daylight as with pencil hatchings . The path grows slippery with mud , and umbrellas collide . Sudden jets of water from spouts overhead splash on her startled pavement . In her dismay , she takes it for the jest of an unmannerly scheme of creation .</p>
     <p>The spring breeze , gone astray in her coil of contortions , stumbles like a drunken vagabond against angle and corner , filling the dusty air with scraps of paper and rag . “ What fury of foolishness ! Are the Gods gone mad ? ” she exclaims in indignation .</p>
     <p>But the daily refuse from the houses on both sides — scales of fish mixed with ashes , vegetable peelings , rotten fruit , and dead rats — never rouse her to question , “ Why should these things be ? ”</p>
     <p>She accepts every stone of her paving . But from between their chinks sometimes a blade of grass peeps up . That baffles her . How can solid facts permit such intrusion ?</p>
     <p>On a morning when at the touch of autumn light her houses wake up into beauty from their foul dreams , she whispers to herself , “ There is a limitless wonder somewhere beyond these buildings . ”</p>
     <p>But the hours pass on ; the households are astir ; the maid strolls back from the market , swinging her right arm and with the left clasping the basket of provisions to her side ; the air grows thick with the smell and smoke of kitchens . It again becomes clear to our Lane that the real and normal consist solely of herself , her houses , and their muck-heaps .</p>
     <p>22</p>
     <p>The house , lingering on after its wealth has vanished , stands by the wayside like a madman with a patched rag over his back .</p>
     <p>Day after day scars it with spiteful scratches , and rainy months leave their fantastic signatures on its bared bricks .</p>
     <p>In a deserted upper room one of a pair of doors has fallen from rusty hinges ; and the other , widowed , bangs day and night to the fitful gusts .</p>
     <p>One night the sound of women wailing came from that house . They mourned the death of the last son of the family , a boy of eighteen , who earned his living by playing the part of the heroine in a travelling theatre .</p>
     <p>A few days more and the house became silent , and all the doors were locked .</p>
     <p>Only on the north side in the upper room that desolate door would neither drop off to its rest nor be shut , but swung to and fro in the wind like a self-torturing soul .</p>
     <p>After a time children 's voices echo once more through that house . Over the balcony-rail women 's clothes are hung in the sun , a bird whistles from a covered cage , and a boy plays with his kite on the terrace .</p>
     <p>A tenant has come to occupy a few rooms . He earns little and has many children . The tired mother beats them and they roll on the floor and shriek .</p>
     <p>A maid-servant of forty drudges through the day , quarrels with her mistress , threatens to , but never leaves .</p>
     <p>Every day some small repairs are done . Paper is pasted in place of missing panes ; gaps in the railings are made good with split bamboo ; an empty box keeps the boltless gate shut ; old stains vaguely show through new whitewash on the walls .</p>
     <p>The magnificence of wealth had found a fitting memorial in gaunt desolation ; but , lacking sufficient means , they try to hide this with dubious devices , and its dignity is outraged .</p>
     <p>They have overlooked the deserted room on the north side . And its forlorn door still bangs in the wind , like Despair beating her breast .</p>
     <p>23</p>
     <p>In the depths of the forest the ascetic practised penance with fast-closed eyes ; he intended to deserve Paradise .</p>
     <p>But the girl who gathered twigs brought him fruits in her skirt , and water from the stream in cups made of leaves .</p>
     <p>The days went on , and his penance grew harsher till the fruits remained untasted , the water untouched : and the girl who gathered twigs was sad .</p>
     <p>The Lord of Paradise heard that a man had dared to aspire to be as the Gods . Time after time he had fought the Titans , who were his peers , and kept them out of his kingdom ; yet he feared a man whose power was that of suffering .</p>
     <p>But he knew the ways of mortals , and he planned a temptation to decoy this creature of dust away from his adventure .</p>
     <p>A breath from Paradise kissed the limbs of the girl who gathered twigs , and her youth ached with a sudden rapture of beauty , and her thoughts hummed like the bees of a rifled hive .</p>
     <p>The time came when the ascetic should leave the forest for a mountain cave , to complete the rigour of his penance .</p>
     <p>When he opened his eyes in order to start on this journey , the girl appeared to him like a verse familiar , yet forgotten , and which an added melody made strange . The ascetic rose from his seat and told her that it was time he left the forest .</p>
     <p>“ But why rob me of my chance to serve you ? ” she asked with tears in her eyes .</p>
     <p>He sat down again , thought for long , and remained on where he was .</p>
     <p>That night remorse kept the girl awake . She began to dread her power and hate her triumph , yet her mind tossed on the waves of turbulent delight .</p>
     <p>In the morning she came and saluted the ascetic and asked his blessing , saying she must leave him .</p>
     <p>He gazed on her face in silence , then said , “ Go , and may your wish be fulfilled . ”</p>
     <p>For years he sat alone till his penance was complete .</p>
     <p>The Lord of the Immortals came down to tell him that he had won Paradise .</p>
     <p>“ I no longer need it , ” said he .</p>
     <p>The God asked him what greater reward he desired .</p>
     <p>“ I want the girl who gathers twigs . ”</p>
     <p>24</p>
     <p>They said that Kabir , the weaver , was favoured of God , and the crowd flocked round him for medicine and miracles . But he was troubled ; his low birth had hitherto endowed him with a most precious obscurity to sweeten with songs and with the presence of his God . He prayed that it might be restored .</p>
     <p>Envious of the repute of this outcast , the priests leagued themselves with a harlot to disgrace him . Kabir came to the market to sell cloths from his loom ; when the woman grasped his hand , blaming him for being faithless , and followed him to his house , saying she would not be forsaken , Kabir said to himself , “ God answers prayers in his own way . ”</p>
     <p>Soon the woman felt a shiver of fear and fell on her knees and cried , “ Save me from my sin ! ” To which he said , “ Open your life to God 's light ! ”</p>
     <p>Kabir worked at his loom and sang , and his songs washed the stains from that woman 's heart , and by way of return found a home in her sweet voice .</p>
     <p>One day the King , in a fit of caprice , sent a message to Kabir to come and sing before him . The weaver shook his head : but the messenger dared not leave his door till his master 's errand was fulfilled .</p>
     <p>The King and his courtiers started at the sight of Kabir when he entered the hall . For he was not alone , the woman followed him . Some smiled , some frowned , and the King 's face darkened at the beggar 's pride and shamelessness .</p>
     <p>Kabir came back to his house disgraced , the woman fell at his feet crying , “ Why accept such dishonour for my sake , master ? Suffer me to go back to my infamy ! ”</p>
     <p>Kabir said , “ I dare not turn my God away when he comes branded with insult . ”</p>

     <p>SHADES</p>
     <p>This hell lies hard by the road to Heaven , whence lights glimmer dimly , only to prove unapproachable . Day and night we listen to the heavenly chariot rumbling by with travellers for that region of bliss ; it drives sleep from our eyes and forces them to watch in fruitless jealousy . Far below us earth 's old forests rustle and her seas chant the primal hymn of creation : they sound like the wail of a memory that wanders void space in vain .</p>

     <head>SOMAKA</head>
     <p>I was named Somaka , the King of Videha . After sacrificing at innumerable shrines weary year on year , a son was born to my house in my old age , love for whom , like a sudden untimely flood , swept consideration for everything else from my life . He hid me completely , as a lotus hides its stem . The neglected duties of a king piled up in shame before my throne . One day , in my audience hall , I heard my child cry from his mother 's room , and instantly rushed away , vacating my throne .</p>
     <p>RITVIK</p>
     <p>Just then , it chanced , I entered the hall to give him my daily benediction ; in blind haste he brushed me aside and enkindled my anger . When later he came back , shame-faced , I asked him : “ King , what desperate alarm could draw you at the busiest hour of the day to the women 's apartments , so as to desert your dignity and duty — ambassadors come from friendly courts , the aggrieved who ask for justice , your ministers waiting to discuss matters of grave import ? and even lead you to slight a Brahmin 's blessing ? ”</p>

     <p>At first my heart flamed with anger ; the next moment I trampled it down like the raised head of a snake and meekly replied : “ Having only one child , I have lost my peace of mind . Forgive me this once , and I promise that in future the father 's infatuation shall never usurp the King . ”</p>
     <p>RITVIK</p>
     <p>But my heart was bitter with resentment , and I said , “ If you must be delivered from the curse of having only one child , I can show you the way . But so hard is it that I feel certain you will fail to follow it . ” This galled the King 's pride and he stood up and exclaimed , “ I swear , by all that is sacred , as a Kshatriya and a King , I will not shrink , but perform whatever you may ask , however hard . ” “ Then listen , ” said I . “ Light a sacrificial fire , offer up your son : the smoke that rises will bring you progeny , as the clouds bring rain . ” The King bowed his head upon his breast and remained silent : the courtiers shouted their horror , the Brahmins clapped their hands over their ears , crying , “ Sin it is both to utter and listen to such words . ” After some moments of bewildered dismay the King calmly said , “ I will abide by my promise . ” The day came , the fire was lit , the town was emptied of its people , the child was called for ; but the attendants refused to obey , the soldiers rebelliously went off duty , throwing down their arms . Then I , who in my wisdom had soared far above all weakness of heart and to whom emotions were illusory , went myself to the apartment where , with their arms , women fenced the child like a flower surrounded by the menacing branches of a tree . He saw me and stretched out eager hands and struggled to come to me , for he longed to be free from the love that imprisoned him . Crying , “ I am come to give you true deliverance , ” I snatched him by force from his fainting mother and his nurses wailing in despair . With quivering tongues the fire licked the sky and the King stood beside it , still and silent , like a tree struck dead by lightning . Fascinated by the godlike splendour of the blaze , the child babbled in glee and danced in my arms , impatient to seek an unknown nurse in the free glory of those flames .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>A very busy girl comes to fetch water from the well . Her feet run on the pavement like rapid fingers over harp-strings . Hastily she ties a negligent knot with her hair , and loose locks on her forehead pry into the dark of her eyes .</p>
     <p>The man says to her , “ Would you lend me your pitcher ? ”</p>
     <p>“ My pitcher ? ” she asks , “ to draw water ? ”</p>
     <p>“ No , to paint patterns on . ”</p>
     <p>“ I have no time to waste , ” the girl retorts in contempt .</p>
     <p>Now a busy soul has no chance against one who is supremely idle .</p>
     <p>Every day she meets him at the well , and every day he repeats the same request , till at last she yields .</p>
     <p>Our man paints the pitcher with curious colours in a mysterious maze of lines .</p>
     <p>The girl takes it up , turns it round and asks , “ What does it mean ? ”</p>
     <p>“ It has no meaning , ” he answers .</p>
     <p>The girl carries the pitcher home . She holds it up in different lights and tries to con its mystery .</p>
     <p>At night she leaves her bed , lights a lamp , and gazes at it from all points of view .</p>
     <p>This is the first time she has met with something without meaning .</p>
     <p>On the next day the man is again near the well .</p>
     <p>The girl asks , “ What do you want ? ”</p>
     <p>“ To do more work for you . ”</p>
     <p>“ What work ? ” she enquires .</p>
     <p>“ Allow me to weave coloured strands into a ribbon to bind your hair . ”</p>
     <p>“ Is there any need ? ” she asks .</p>
     <p>“ None whatever , ” he allows .</p>
     <p>The ribbon is made , and thence-forward she spends a great deal of time over her hair .</p>
     <p>The even stretch of well-employed time in that Paradise begins to show irregular rents .</p>
     <p>The elders are troubled ; they meet in council .</p>
     <p>The guide confesses his blunder , saying that he has brought the wrong man to the wrong place .</p>
     <p>The wrong man is called . His turban , flaming with colour , shows plainly how great that blunder has been .</p>
     <p>The chief of the elders says , “ You must go back to the earth . ”</p>
     <p>The man heaves a sigh of relief : “ I am ready . ”</p>
     <p>The girl with the ribbon round her hair chimes in : “ I also ! ”</p>
     <p>For the first time the chief of the elders is faced with a situation which has no sense in it .</p>
     <p>27</p>
     <p>It is said that in the forest , near the meeting of river and lake , certain fairies live in disguise who are only recognised as fairies after they have flown away .</p>
     <p>A Prince went to this forest , and when he came where river met lake he saw a village girl sitting on the bank ruffling the water to make the lilies dance .</p>
     <p>He asked her in a whisper , “ Tell me , what fairy art thou ? ”</p>
     <p>The girl laughed at the question and the hillsides echoed her mirth .</p>
     <p>The Prince thought she was the laughing fairy of the waterfall .</p>
     <p>News reached the King that the Prince had married a fairy : he sent horses and men and brought them to his house .</p>
     <p>The Queen saw the bride and turned her face away in disgust , the Prince 's sister flushed red with annoyance , and the maids asked if that was how fairies dressed .</p>
     <p>The Prince whispered , “ Hush ! my fairy has come to our house in disguise . ”</p>
     <p>On the day of the yearly festival the Queen said to her son , “ Ask your bride not to shame us before our kinsfolk who are coming to see the fairy . ”</p>
     <p>And the Prince said to his bride , “ For my love 's sake show thy true self to my people . ”</p>
     <p>Long she sat silent , then nodded her promise while tears ran down her cheeks .</p>
     <p>The full moon shone , the Prince , dressed in a wedding robe , entered his bride 's room .</p>
     <p>No one was there , nothing but a streak of moonlight from the window aslant the bed .</p>
     <p>The kinsfolk crowded in with the King and the Queen , the Prince 's sister stood by the door .</p>
     <p>All asked , “ Where is the fairy bride ? ”</p>
     <p>The Prince answered , “ She has vanished for ever to make herself known to you . ”</p>

     <head>KARNA AND KUNTI</head>
     <p>The Pandava Queen Kunti before marriage had a son , Karna , who , in manhood , became the commander of the Kaurava host . To hide her shame she abandoned him at birth , and a charioteer , Adhiratha , brought him up as his son .</p>

     <p>I do not understand : but your eyes melt my heart as the kiss of the morning sun melts the snow on a mountain-top , and your voice rouses a blind sadness within me of which the cause may well lie beyond the reach of my earliest memory . Tell me , strange woman , what mystery binds my birth to you ?</p>

       <l n="1">Patience , my son . I will answer when the lids of darkness come down over</l>
       <l n="2">the prying eyes of day . In the meanwhile , know that I am Kunti .</l>

       <l n="1">Kunti ! The mother of Arjuna ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>KUNTI</p>
     <p>Yes , indeed , the mother of Arjuna , your antagonist . But do not , therefore , hate me . I still remember the day of the trial of arms in Hastina when you , an unknown boy , boldly stepped into the arena , like the first ray of dawn among the stars of night . Ah ! who was that unhappy woman whose eyes kissed your bare , slim body through tears that blessed you , where she sat among the women of the royal household behind the arras ? Why , the mother of Arjuna ! Then the Brahmin , master of arms , stepped forth and said , “ No youth of mean birth may challenge Arjuna to a trial of strength . ” You stood speechless , like a thunder-cloud at sunset flashing with an agony of suppressed light . But who was the woman whose heart caught fire from your shame and anger , and flared up in silence ? The mother of Arjuna ! Praised be Duryodhana , who perceived your worth , and then and there crowned you King of Anga , thus winning the Kauravas a champion . Overwhelmed at this good fortune , Adhiratha , the charioteer , broke through the crowd ; you instantly rushed to him and laid your crown at his feet amid the jeering laughter of the Pandavas and their friends . But there was one woman of the Pandava house whose heart glowed with joy at the heroic pride of such humility ;— even the mother of Arjuna !</p>

     <p>KARNA</p>
     <p>The gloom of evening spreads over the earth , silence rests on the water , and your voice leads me back to some primal world of infancy lost in twilit consciousness . However , whether this be dream , or fragment of forgotten reality , come near and place your right hand on my forehead . Rumour runs that I was deserted by my mother . Many a night she has come to me in my slumber , but when I cried : “ Open your veil , show me your face ! ” her figure always vanished . Has this same dream come this evening while I wake ? See , yonder the lamps are lighted in your son 's tents across the river ; and on this side behold the tent-domes of my Kauravas , like the suspended waves of a spell-arrested storm at sea . Before the din of tomorrow 's battle , in the awful hush of this field where it must be fought , why should the voice of the mother of my opponent , Arjuna , bring me a message of forgotten motherhood ? and why should my name take such music from her tongue as to draw my heart out to him and his brothers ?</p>

     <p>Yes , I will come and never ask question , never doubt . My soul responds to your call ; and the struggle for victory and fame and the rage of hatred have suddenly become untrue to me , as the delirious dream of a night in the serenity of the dawn . Tell me whither you mean to lead ?</p>

     <p>KARNA</p>
     <p>Then why did you banish me — a castaway uprooted from my ancestral soil , adrift in a homeless current of indignity ? Why set a bottomless chasm between Arjuna and myself , turning the natural attachment of kinship to the dread attraction of hate ? You remain speechless . Your shame permeates the vast darkness and sends invisible shivers through my limbs . Leave my question unanswered ! Never explain to me what made you rob your son of his mother 's love ! Only tell me why you have come to-day to call me back to the ruins of a heaven wrecked by your own hands ?</p>
     <p>KUNTI</p>
     <p>I am dogged by a curse more deadly than your reproaches : for , though surrounded by five sons , my heart shrivels like that of a woman deprived of her children . Through the great rent that yawned for my deserted first-born , all my life 's pleasures have run to waste . On that accursed day when I belied my motherhood you could not utter a word ; to-day your recreant mother implores you for generous words . Let your forgiveness burn her heart like fire and consume its sin .</p>

     <p>Must you , who once refused me a mother 's love , tempt me with a kingdom ? The quick bond of kindred which you severed at its root is dead , and can never grow again . Shame were mine should I hasten to call the mother of kings mother , and abandon my mother in the charioteer 's house !</p>
     <p>KUNTI</p>
     <p>You are great , my son ! How God 's punishment invisibly grows from a tiny seed to a giant life ! The helpless babe disowned by his mother comes back a man through the dark maze of events to smite his brothers !</p>

      <head>KARNA</head>
      <head>Mother , have no fear ! I know for certain that victory awaits the Pandavas . Peaceful and still though this night be , my heart is full of the music of a hopeless venture and baffled end . Ask me not to leave those who are doomed to defeat . Let the Pandavas win the throne , since they must : I remain with the desperate and forlorn . On the night of my birth you left me naked and unnamed to disgrace : leave me once again without pity to the calm expectation of defeat and death !</head>
       <l n="1">29</l>
     </lg>
     <p>When like a flaming scimitar the hill stream has been sheathed in gloom by the evening , suddenly a flock of birds passes overhead , their loud-laughing wings hurling their flight like an arrow among stars .</p>
     <p>It startles a passion for speed in the heart of all motionless things ; the hills seem to feel in their bosom the anguish of storm-clouds , and trees long to break their rooted shackles .</p>
     <p>For me the flight of these birds has rent a veil of stillness , and reveals an immense flutter in this deep silence .</p>
     <p>I see these hills and forests fly across time to the unknown , and darkness thrill into fire as the stars wing by .</p>
     <p>I feel in my own being the rush of the sea-crossing bird , cleaving a way beyond the limits of life and death , while the migrant world cries with a myriad voices , “ Not here , but somewhere else , in the bosom of the Faraway . ”</p>
     <p>30</p>
     <p>The crowd listens in wonder to Kashi , the young singer , whose voice , like a sword in feats of skill , dances amidst hopeless tangles , cuts them to pieces , and exults .</p>
     <p>Among the hearers sits old Rajah Pratap in weary endurance . For his own life had been nourished and encircled by Barajlal 's songs , like a happy land which a river laces with beauty . His rainy evenings and the still hours of autumn days spoke to his heart through Barajlal 's voice , and his festive nights trimmed their lamps and tinkled their bells to those songs .</p>
     <p>When Kashi stopped for rest , Pratap smilingly winked at Barajlal and spoke to him in a whisper , “ Master , now let us hear music and not this new-fangled singing , which mimics frisky kittens hunting paralysed mice . ”</p>
     <p>The old singer with his spotlessly white turban made a deep bow to the assembly and took his seat . His thin fingers struck the strings of his instrument , his eyes closed , and in timid hesitation his song began . The hall was large , his voice feeble , and Pratap shouted “ Bravo ! ” with ostentation , but whispered in his ear , “ Just a little louder , friend ! ”</p>
     <p>The crowd was restless ; some yawned , some dozed , some complained of the heat . The air of the hall hummed with many-toned inattention , and the song , like a frail boat , tossed upon it in vain till it sank under the hubbub .</p>
     <p>Suddenly the old man , stricken at heart , forgot a passage , and his voice groped in agony , like a blind man at a fair for his lost leader . He tried to fill the gap with any strain that came . But the gap still yawned : and the tortured notes refused to serve the need , suddenly changed their tune , and broke into a sob . The master laid his head on his instrument , and in place of his forgotten music , there broke from him the first cry of life that a child brings into the world .</p>
     <p>Pratap touched him gently on his shoulder , and said , “ Come away , our meeting is elsewhere . I know , my friend , that truth is widowed without love , and beauty dwells not with the many , nor in the moment . ”</p>
     <p>31</p>
     <p>In the youth of the world , Himalaya , you sprang from the rent breast of the earth , and hurled your burning challenges to the sun , hill after hill . Then came the mellow time when you said to yourself , “ No more , no further ! ” and your fiery heart , that raged for the freedom of clouds , found its limits , and stood still to salute the limitless . After this check on your passion , beauty was free to play upon your breast , and trust surrounded you with the joy of flowers and birds .</p>
     <p>You sit in your solitude like a great reader , on whose lap lies open some ancient book with its countless pages of stone . What story is written there , I wonder ?— is it the eternal wedding of the divine ascetic , Shiva , with Bhavani , the divine love ?— the drama of the Terrible wooing the power of the Frail ?</p>
     <p>32</p>
     <p>I feel that my heart will leave its own colour in all your scenes , O Earth , when I bid you farewell . Some notes of mine will be added to your seasons ’ melody , and my thoughts will breathe unrecognised through the cycle of shadows and sunshine .</p>
     <p>In far-distant days summer will come to the lovers ’ garden , but they will not know that their flowers have borrowed an added beauty from my songs , nor that their love for this world has been deepened by mine .</p>
     <p>33</p>
     <p>My eyes feel the deep peace of this sky , and there stirs through me what a tree feels when it holds out its leaves like cups to be filled with sunshine .</p>
     <p>A thought rises in my mind , like the warm breath from grass in the sun ; it mingles with the gurgle of lapping water and the sigh of weary wind in village lanes ,— the thought that I have lived along with the whole life of this world and have given to it my own love and sorrows .</p>
     <p>34</p>
     <p>I ask no reward for the songs I sang you . I shall be content if they live through the night , until Dawn , like a shepherd-maiden , calls away the stars , in alarm at the sun .</p>
     <p>But there were moments when you sang your songs to me , and as my pride knows , my Poet , you will ever remember that I listened and lost my heart .</p>
     <p>35</p>
     <p>In the morning , when the dew glistened upon the grass , you came and gave a push to my swing ; but , sweeping from smiles to tears , I did not know you .</p>
     <p>Then came April 's noon of gorgeous light , and I think you beckoned me to follow you .</p>
     <p>But when I sought your face , there passed between us the procession of flowers , and men and women flinging their songs to the south wind .</p>
     <p>Daily I passed you unheeded on the road .</p>
     <p>But on some days full of the faint smell of oleanders , when the wind was wilful among complaining palm leaves , I would stand before you wondering if you ever had been a stranger to me .</p>
     <p>36</p>
     <p>The day grew dim . The early evening star faltered near the edge of a grey lonely sky .</p>
     <p>I looked back and felt that the road lying behind me was infinitely removed ; traced through my life , it had only served for a single journey and was never to be re-travelled .</p>
     <p>The long story of my coming hither lies there dumb , in one meandering line of dust stretching from the morning hilltop to the brink of bottomless night .</p>
     <p>I sit alone , and wonder if this road is like an instrument waiting to give up the day 's lost voices in music when touched by divine fingers at nightfall .</p>
     <p>37</p>
     <p>Give me the supreme courage of love , this is my prayer — the courage to speak , to do , to suffer at thy will , to leave all things or be left alone . Strengthen me on errands of danger , honour me with pain , and help me climb to that difficult mood which sacrifices daily to thee .</p>
     <p>Give me the supreme confidence of love , this is my prayer — the confidence that belongs to life in death , to victory in defeat , to the power hidden in frailest beauty , to that dignity in pain which accepts hurt but disdains to return it .</p>
