    <docImprint>The following Sonnet Sequence ,— written during rare intervals of leisure in a busy and strenuous life ,— was privately printed in Madras early in<date>1914</date>, without any intention of publication on the part of the author . He has , however , now consented to allow it to be given to a wider audience ; and we anticipate in many directions a welcome for this small but significant volume by the writer of India to<country>England</country>, one of the most popular and often-quoted lyrics evoked by the Great War . The Nawab Nizamat Jung Bahadur , was born in the State of Hyderabad , but educated in<country>England</country>; and there are some — at<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>and elsewhere — who will remember his keenly discriminating interest in British history and literature , and the comprehensive way he , in a few words , would indicate his impressions of poets and heroes , long dead , but to him ever-living . His appreciation was both ardent and just ; he could swiftly recognise the nobler elements in characters which at first glance might seem startlingly dissimilar ; and he could pass without apparent effort from study of the lives of men of action to the inward contemplations of abstruse philosophers . To those who have not met him , it may appear paradoxical to say that his tastes were at the same moment acutely fastidious and widely sympathetic ; but anyone who has talked with him will recall the blend of high impersonal ideas with a remarkable personality which seldom failed to stimulate other minds — even if those others shared few if any of his intellectual tastes . A famous British General ( still living ) was once asked , “ What is the most essential quality for a great leader of men ? ” And he replied in one word “ SYMPATHY . ” The General was speaking of leadership in relation to warfare ; and by “ Sympathy ” he meant swift insight into the minds of others ; and , with this insight , the power to arouse and fan into a flame the spark of chivalry and true nobility in each . The career of the Nawab Nizamat Jung has not been set in the world of action ,— he is at present a Judge of the High Court in Hyderabad ,— but nevertheless this definition of sympathy is not irrelevant , for the Nawab 's personal influence has been more subtle and far-reaching than he himself is yet aware . His love of poetry and history , if on the one hand it has intensified his realisation of the sorrows and tragedies of earthly life , on the other hand has equipped him with a power to awake in others a vivid consciousness of the moral value of literature ,— through which ( for the mere asking ) we any of us can find our way into a kingdom of great ideas . This kingdom is also the kingdom of eternal realities — or so at least it should be ; and those who in the early nineties in<country>England</country>talked with Nizamoudhin ( as he then was ) could scarcely fail to notice that he valued the genius of an author , or the exploits of a character in history , chiefly in proportion to the permanent and vital nature of the truths this character had laboured to express — whether in words or action . But Truth , has many faces ; and scarcely any poet ( except perhaps Shakespeare ) has come within measurable distance of expressing every aspect of the human character . The Nawab could take pleasure in reading poets as temperamentally dissimilar as Shelley and Scott , Spenser and Byron ,— to name only a few . Shelley , who was a spirit utterly unable to understand this world or ordinary homespun human nature ; and Scott , who not only comprehended both without an effort , but who combined the practical and the romantic elements successfully in his own life , A devotion to Spenser , “ the poet 's poet , ” the poet of a dreamy yet very real and living chivalry ,— Spenser who used to forget himself in his creations ,— did not prevent the Nawab from understanding Byron , who never could forget himself at all ; and who , with all his vivid impulses of generous sympathy for the oppressed , is nevertheless generally classed to-day as a colossal egoist . ( Unjustly so , for no mere egoist would have toiled as he toiled for Greek emancipation , in the nerve-racking campaign which cost him his life . ) In India to<country>England</country>— most characteristic of the war poems of Nizamat Jung — we see traces of the influence of more than one of the English poets he has read so lovingly . But the poem is none the less poignantly personal . The same may be said of the Sonnets here prefaced ; for although they are related to the sonnets of earlier poets whose work must be familiar to the writer , yet they are in no sense imitations , nor are they echoes . “ Poetry is the natural language of strong emotion , ” the Nawab said many years ago ;— and if it may be asked why , holding this view , he has chosen such an elaborate ( and , some people might add , artificial ) form as the Sonnet , we can only answer that when an emotion or conviction is deep-seated and permanent , it becomes clarified , concentrated , and intensified under the stern discipline of compression within the arbitrary yet expressive limitations of a sonnet . [ A ] One of the main reasons why the Nawab 's friends have urged the publication of his Sonnets , is that despite occasional imperfections ( of which he himself is conscious ) , they form a consistent whole , and in their spirit and sentiment they are akin to some of the most noble utterances of the great minds and hearts whose words have been like torches to show what heights a strong aspiring soul can climb . “ The Will is the master . Imagination the tool , and the body the plastic material , ” said a famous physician , who was also a practical man of the world ;— and the poet who identifies his will and imagination with the eternal truths , who looks up to the stars instead of down into the mud , may always , even in his weariest hours , cheer himself by mental companionship with the other resolute souls whose pens have been used as swords in the service of Divine Beauty . Of all the most famous writers of Sonnets , it is Michelangelo whose words come back most vividly to memory as we read the Nawab 's expressions of faith .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Love wakes the soul and gives it wings to fly . ” “ All beauty that to human sight is given Is but the shadow , if we rightly see , Of Him from Whom man 's spirit issueth . ” “ As heat from fire , my love from the ideal Is parted never . ” “ Oh noble spirit , noble semblance taking , We mirrored in Thy mortal beauty see What Heaven and earth achieve in harmony . ” Thus wrote Michelangelo of Vittoria Colonna ( Marchioness of Pescara ) , “ being enamoured of her divine spirit ” ; [ B ] and though in the Sonnets of the Nawab , who uses what is for him a foreign tongue , the ideal is sometimes greater than the expression of it , yet the spirit shines out with a light which none can mistake . And whether the average man accepts or rejects the standards therein embodied , lovers of poetry will recognise that the Nawab , in his championship of a high and noble ideal , fights in the same army as Dante and Michelangelo ,— neither of them cloistered dreamers , neither of them arm-chair theorists , but men who lived and loved and suffered amidst the turmoil of a world they viewed with wide-open eyes and unflinching minds . The chivalrous ideal of an exalted and inspiring love can be rejected if we please ;— but let none claim to be manly because this ideal seems too ethereal . For it is by the most vigorous , most strenuous , and most commanding souls and minds that this faith in the Eternal Beauty has been cherished and upheld most ardently and resolutely .</p>

     <head>NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE SONNET IN ENGLISH LITERATURE</head>
     <p>Now that Italy holds such a brilliant place among our Allies during this the greatest war in the world 's history — the war of chivalry ( which is to say moral and spiritual right ) against the arrogant might of the Prussian Octopus ,— it is well to remember that it was from Italy the Sonnet first came into England . The word sonnet in fact , is from the Italian sonetto ( literally “ a little sound ” ) , and the sonetto was originally a short poem recited or sung to the accompaniment of music , probably the lute or mandolin .</p>
     <p>Whether its birth should be attributed to Italy or Sicily ,— or to Provence , the cradle of troubadour poetry ,— is a subject on which the learned may still indulge in pleasant controversies . But in Italy , towards the end of the thirteenth century , it had already become a favourite mode of expression ; and some forty years later , in a manuscript treatise on the Poetica Volgare ( written in 1332 by a Judge in Padua ) , sixteen different forms of sonnet were enumerated as then in current use .</p>
     <p>But despite the continued vogue of the Sonnet , and its association with the names of such masters as Dante , Petrarch , Tasso and Michelangelo in Italy ; Ronsard in France ; Camoens in Portugal ; Shakespeare , Milton , Wordsworth and Rossetti in England — to say nothing of a host of minor poets , who , though one star differeth from another in glory , yet constitute a brilliant galaxy — it is remarkable that even now the average non-literary reader when asked “ What is a Sonnet ? ” seldom gives any more explicit reply than to say it is “ a short poem limited to fourteen lines . ”</p>
     <p>The rules for the structure of those fourteen lines , and the labour and patience entailed in producing a poem under these limitations , are not always realised even by those who enjoy the results of the poet 's concentrated efforts . The more successful a sonnet , the more the reader is apt to accept its beauty as if it had grown by a natural process like a flower . This , perhaps , is the best compliment we could pay the poet ; but if the poet is one who boldly essays a most difficult and complex form , in a language which for him is foreign , then we should pause a moment to consider what it is that he has set out to accomplish .</p>
     <p>Taking the structure first ( though for the poet the spirit and impetus of the central idea must of course come first ) — a sonnet on the Italian ( Petrarchan ) model must consist of fourteen lines of ten syllables each , and must be composed of a major and minor system , i. e . an octave and a sestet .</p>
     <p>In the octave ( the first eight lines ) the first , fourth , fifth and eighth lines must rhyme on the same sound , and the second , third , sixth and seventh , must rhyme on another sound .</p>
     <p>In the sestet ( the last six lines ) more liberty of rhyme and arrangement is permitted , but a rhymed couplet at the end is not usual except when the sonnet departs from the Italian model and is on the English or , as we say , “ Shakespearian ” pattern .</p>
     <p>Each sonnet must be complete ; and , even if one of a sequence , it should contain within itself everything necessary to the understanding of it . It must be the expression of one emotion , one fact , one idea , and “ the continuity of the thought , idea , or emotion must be unbroken throughout . ” “ Dignity and repose , ” “ expression ample yet reticent , ” are qualities which one of our ablest modern critics emphasises as essential , and the end must always be more impressive than the beginning ,— the reader must be carried onwards and upwards , and left with a definite feeling that in what has been said there is neither superfluity nor omission , but rather a completeness which precludes all wish or need for a longer poem .</p>
     <p>How difficult this is for the poet can only be realised by trying to achieve it .</p>
     <p>The earliest writers of English sonnets were two very romantic and gallant men of action , Sir Thomas Wyatt , and Henry Howard , Earl of Surrey ,— both destined to brief brilliant lives and tragic deaths . They were followed by Spenser , Sir Philip Sidney and a host of Elizabethan poets , courtly and otherwise . But it is Shakespeare whose Sonnets ( though not conforming to the Petrarchan model ) show the most force and fire of any in our language until those of Milton .</p>
     <p>To analyse the variations of the Shakesperian , Spenserian and Miltonian forms is , however , unnecessary to our present purpose , as the Sonnet Sequence we are now prefacing is based on the Petrarchan model . Strictly speaking , the Petrarchan sestet ( the last six lines ) should have three separate rhymed sounds ; the first and fourth lines , the second and fifth , and the third and sixth should form the three rhymes . But this rule is by no means invariably followed ; even Wordsworth and Rossetti often rhymed the first with the third , and the second with the fourth lines ; and sometimes used only two sounds ,— the first , third , and fifth lines making one rhyme and the second , fourth , and sixth the other .</p>
     <p>As already said , these liberties are permitted , for the sestet is not under such arbitrary regulations as the octave .</p>
     <p>There are writers who keep all the rules , and yet leave their readers cold ; and others who are technically less correct , but in whom the vigour and intensity of emotion is swiftly felt and silences adverse criticism . The ideal is to combine deep and exalted feeling with perfect expression , and produce a whole which goes to the heart like a beautiful piece of music , and satisfies the mind — like one of those ancient Greek gems which , in a small space , presents engraved images symbolic of sublime ideas vast as the universe .</p>
     <p>The Nawab Nizamat Jung has written in English several sonnets which we should admire even if English were his native language . But if any of us would like to form some estimate of the difficulties he has surmounted , let us sit down and try to express in a sonnet in any foreign language our own thoughts and beliefs . We shall then the better appreciate what he has achieved .</p>
     <p>As , however , while the Great War lasts , few of us have leisure for literary experiments , it will perhaps be best to read these Sonnets primarily for their soul and spirit . In melody and expression they are of varying degrees of merit and completeness , but in the inspiring ideal they consistently embody they rise to heights which have been scaled only by the noblest . In tone and temper — as already said — they are akin to the Sonnets to Vittoria Colonna by Michelangelo ,— of whom it was written by one who knew him well , “ Though I have held such long intercourse with him I have never heard from his mouth a word , that was not most honourable .... In him there are no base thoughts .... He loves not only human beauty , but everything that is beautiful and exquisite in its own kind ,— marvelling at it with a wonderful admiration . ”</p>
     <p>Here we see defined the temperament of the heroic poet , that inner nobility and exaltation without which mere technical skill can avail little in moving and holding the hearts of men .</p>
     <p>This note on the structure of the Sonnet would fail in its purpose if it distracted the reader from the spirit behind the form ;— for the spirit is the life ,— and few who read these Sonnets will deny that the spirit of Nizamat Jung is that of the true poet , ever striving to look beyond ephemeral sorrows up to the Eternal Beauty — now hidden behind a veil , but some day to be revealed in all its splendour and completeness .</p>
