     <p>“ ‘ ... See small portions of the Eternal World that ever groweth ':... So sang a Fairy , mocking , as he sat on a streak 'd tulip , Thinking none saw him : when he ceas 'd I started from the trees , And caught him in my hat , as boys knock down a butterfly . ” William Blake . “ Europe . A Prophecy . ” ‘ Thou hast a lap full of seed , And this is a fine country . ’ William Blake .</p>

    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="1">This is a book of stories . For that reason I have excluded all purely lyrical poems . But the word “ stories ” has been stretched to its fullest application . It includes both narrative poems , properly so called ; tales divided into scenes ; and a few pieces of less obvious story-telling import in which one might say that the dramatis personae are air , clouds , trees , houses , streets , and such like things .</p>
    <p n="2">It has long been a favourite idea of mine that the rhythms of ‘ vers libre ’ have not been sufficiently plumbed , that there is in them a power of variation which has never yet been brought to the light of experiment . I think it was the piano pieces of Debussy , with their strange likeness to short vers libre poems , which first showed me the close kinship of music and poetry , and there flashed into my mind the idea of using the movement of poetry in somewhat the same way that the musician uses the movement of music .</p>
    <p n="3">It was quite evident that this could never be done in the strict pattern of a metrical form , but the flowing , fluctuating rhythm of vers libre seemed to open the door to such an experiment . First , however , I considered the same method as applied to the more pronounced movements of natural objects . If the reader will turn to the poem , “ A Roxbury Garden ” , he will find in the first two sections an attempt to give the circular movement of a hoop bowling along the ground , and the up and down , elliptical curve of a flying shuttlecock .</p>
    <p n="4">From these experiments , it is but a step to the flowing rhythm of music . In “ The Cremona Violin ” , I have tried to give this flowing , changing rhythm to the parts in which the violin is being played . The effect is farther heightened , because the rest of the poem is written in the seven line Chaucerian stanza ; and , by deserting this ordered pattern for the undulating line of vers libre , I hoped to produce something of the suave , continuous tone of a violin . Again , in the violin parts themselves , the movement constantly changes , as will be quite plain to any one reading these passages aloud .</p>
    <p n="5">In “ The Cremona Violin ” , however , the rhythms are fairly obvious and regular . I set myself a far harder task in trying to transcribe the various movements of Stravinsky 's “ Three Pieces ‘ Grotesques ’ , for String Quartet ” . Several musicians , who have seen the poem , think the movement accurately given .</p>
    <p n="6">These experiments lead me to believe that there is here much food for thought and matter for study , and I hope many poets will follow me in opening up the still hardly explored possibilities of vers libre .</p>
    <p n="7">A good many of the poems in this book are written in “ polyphonic prose ” . A form about which I have written and spoken so much that it seems hardly necessary to explain it here . Let me hastily add , however , that the word “ prose ” in its name refers only to the typographical arrangement , for in no sense is this a prose form . Only read it aloud , Gentle Reader , I beg , and you will see what you will see . For a purely dramatic form , I know none better in the whole range of poetry . It enables the poet to give his characters the vivid , real effect they have in a play , while at the same time writing in the ‘ decor ’ .</p>
    <p n="8">One last innovation I have still to mention . It will be found in “ Spring Day ” , and more fully enlarged upon in the series , “ Towns in Colour ” . In these poems , I have endeavoured to give the colour , and light , and shade , of certain places and hours , stressing the purely pictorial effect , and with little or no reference to any other aspect of the places described . It is an enchanting thing to wander through a city looking for its unrelated beauty , the beauty by which it captivates the sensuous sense of seeing .</p>
    <p n="9">I have always loved aquariums , but for years I went to them and looked , and looked , at those swirling , shooting , looping patterns of fish , which always defied transcription to paper until I hit upon the “ unrelated ” method . The result is in “ An Aquarium ” . I think the first thing which turned me in this direction was John Gould Fletcher 's “ London Excursion ” , in “ Some Imagist Poets ” . I here record my thanks .</p>
    <p n="10">For the substance of the poems — why , the poems are here . No one writing to-day can fail to be affected by the great war raging in Europe at this time . We are too near it to do more than touch upon it . But , obliquely , it is suggested in many of these poems , most notably those in the section , “ Bronze Tablets ” . The Napoleonic Era is an epic subject , and waits a great epic poet . I have only been able to open a few windows upon it here and there . But the scene from the windows is authentic , and the watcher has used eyes , and ears , and heart , in watching .</p>

       <l n="56">All about us in the open afternoon —</l>
       <l n="57">I am very like to swoon</l>

     <p>A bullet through his heart at dawn . On the table a letter signed with a woman 's name . A wind that goes howling round the house , and weeping as in shame . Cold November dawn peeping through the windows , cold dawn creeping over the floor , creeping up his cold legs , creeping over his cold body , creeping across his cold face . A glaze of thin yellow sunlight on the staring eyes . Wind howling through bent branches . A wind which never dies down . Howling , wailing . The gazing eyes glitter in the sunlight . The lids are frozen open and the eyes glitter .</p>
     <p>The thudding of a pick on hard earth . A spade grinding and crunching . Overhead , branches writhing , winding , interlacing , unwinding , scattering ; tortured twinings , tossings , creakings . Wind flinging branches apart , drawing them together , whispering and whining among them . A waning , lopsided moon cutting through black clouds . A stream of pebbles and earth and the empty spade gleams clear in the moonlight , then is rammed again into the black earth . Tramping of feet . Men and horses . Squeaking of wheels .</p>
     <p>“ Whoa ! Ready , Jim ? ”</p>
     <p>“ All ready . ”</p>
     <p>Something falls , settles , is still . Suicides have no coffin .</p>
     <p>“ Give us the stake , Jim . Now . ”</p>
     <p>Pound ! Pound !</p>
     <p>“ He 'll never walk . Nailed to the ground . ”</p>
     <p>An ash stick pierces his heart , if it buds the roots will hold him . He is a part of the earth now , clay to clay . Overhead the branches sway , and writhe , and twist in the wind . He 'll never walk with a bullet in his heart , and an ash stick nailing him to the cold , black ground .</p>
     <p>Six months he lay still . Six months . And the water welled up in his body , and soft blue spots chequered it . He lay still , for the ash stick held him in place . Six months ! Then her face came out of a mist of green . Pink and white and frail like Dresden china , lilies-of-the-valley at her breast , puce-coloured silk sheening about her . Under the young green leaves , the horse at a foot-pace , the high yellow wheels of the chaise scarcely turning , her face , rippling like grain a-blowing , under her puce-coloured bonnet ; and burning beside her , flaming within his correct blue coat and brass buttons , is someone . What has dimmed the sun ? The horse steps on a rolling stone ; a wind in the branches makes a moan . The little leaves tremble and shake , turn and quake , over and over , tearing their stems . There is a shower of young leaves , and a sudden-sprung gale wails in the trees .</p>
     <p>The yellow-wheeled chaise is rocking — rocking , and all the branches are knocking — knocking . The sun in the sky is a flat , red plate , the branches creak and grate . She screams and cowers , for the green foliage is a lowering wave surging to smother her . But she sees nothing . The stake holds firm . The body writhes , the body squirms . The blue spots widen , the flesh tears , but the stake wears well in the deep , black ground . It holds the body in the still , black ground .</p>
     <p>Two years ! The body has been in the ground two years . It is worn away ; it is clay to clay . Where the heart moulders , a greenish dust , the stake is thrust . Late August it is , and night ; a night flauntingly jewelled with stars , a night of shooting stars and loud insect noises . Down the road to Tilbury , silence — and the slow flapping of large leaves . Down the road to Sutton , silence — and the darkness of heavy-foliaged trees . Down the road to Wayfleet , silence — and the whirring scrape of insects in the branches . Down the road to Edgarstown , silence — and stars like stepping-stones in a pathway overhead . It is very quiet at the cross-roads , and the sign-board points the way down the four roads , endlessly points the way where nobody wishes to go .</p>
     <p>A horse is galloping , galloping up from Sutton . Shaking the wide , still leaves as he goes under them . Striking sparks with his iron shoes ; silencing the katydids . Dr. Morgan riding to a child-birth over Tilbury way ; riding to deliver a woman of her first-born son . One o'clock from Wayfleet bell tower , what a shower of shooting stars ! And a breeze all of a sudden , jarring the big leaves and making them jerk up and down . Dr. Morgan 's hat is blown from his head , the horse swerves , and curves away from the sign-post . An oath — spurs — a blurring of grey mist . A quick left twist , and the gelding is snorting and racing down the Tilbury road with the wind dropping away behind him .</p>
     <p>The stake has wrenched , the stake has started , the body , flesh from flesh , has parted . But the bones hold tight , socket and ball , and clamping them down in the hard , black ground is the stake , wedged through ribs and spine . The bones may twist , and heave , and twine , but the stake holds them still in line . The breeze goes down , and the round stars shine , for the stake holds the fleshless bones in line .</p>
     <p>Twenty years now ! Twenty long years ! The body has powdered itself away ; it is clay to clay . It is brown earth mingled with brown earth . Only flaky bones remain , lain together so long they fit , although not one bone is knit to another . The stake is there too , rotted through , but upright still , and still piercing down between ribs and spine in a straight line .</p>
     <p>Yellow stillness is on the cross-roads , yellow stillness is on the trees . The leaves hang drooping , wan . The four roads point four yellow ways , saffron and gamboge ribbons to the gaze . A little swirl of dust blows up Tilbury road , the wind which fans it has not strength to do more ; it ceases , and the dust settles down . A little whirl of wind comes up Tilbury road . It brings a sound of wheels and feet . The wind reels a moment and faints to nothing under the sign-post . Wind again , wheels and feet louder . Wind again — again — again . A drop of rain , flat into the dust . Drop !— Drop ! Thick heavy raindrops , and a shrieking wind bending the great trees and wrenching off their leaves .</p>
     <p>Under the black sky , bowed and dripping with rain , up Tilbury road , comes the procession . A funeral procession , bound for the graveyard at Wayfleet . Feet and wheels — feet and wheels . And among them one who is carried .</p>
     <p>The bones in the deep , still earth shiver and pull . There is a quiver through the rotted stake . Then stake and bones fall together in a little puffing of dust .</p>
     <p>Like meshes of linked steel the rain shuts down behind the procession , now well along the Wayfleet road .</p>
     <p>He wavers like smoke in the buffeting wind . His fingers blow out like smoke , his head ripples in the gale . Under the sign-post , in the pouring rain , he stands , and watches another quavering figure drifting down the Wayfleet road . Then swiftly he streams after it . It flickers among the trees . He licks out and winds about them . Over , under , blown , contorted . Spindrift after spindrift ; smoke following smoke . There is a wailing through the trees , a wailing of fear , and after it laughter — laughter — laughter , skirling up to the black sky . Lightning jags over the funeral procession . A heavy clap of thunder . Then darkness and rain , and the sound of feet and wheels .</p>

       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="2">
        <l n="2">The throats of the little red trumpet-flowers are wide open ,</l>
        <l n="3">And the clangour of brass beats against the hot sunlight .</l>
        <l n="4">They bray and blare at the burning sky .</l>
        <l n="5">Red ! Red ! Coarse notes of red ,</l>
        <l n="6">Trumpeted at the blue sky .</l>
        <l n="7">In long streaks of sound , molten metal ,</l>
        <l n="8">The vine declares itself .</l>
        <l n="9">Clang !— from its red and yellow trumpets .</l>
        <l n="10">Clang !— from its long , nasal trumpets ,</l>
        <l n="11">Splitting the sunlight into ribbons , tattered and shot with noise .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="12">I sit in the cool arbour , in a green-and-gold twilight .</l>
        <l n="13">It is very still , for I cannot hear the trumpets ,</l>
        <l n="14">I only know that they are red and open ,</l>
        <l n="15">And that the sun above the arbour shakes with heat .</l>
        <l n="16">My quill is newly mended ,</l>
        <l n="17">And makes fine-drawn lines with its point .</l>
        <l n="18">Down the long , white paper it makes little lines ,</l>
        <l n="19">Just lines — up — down — criss-cross .</l>
        <l n="20">My heart is strained out at the pin-point of my quill ;</l>
        <l n="21">It is thin and writhing like the marks of the pen .</l>
        <l n="22">My hand marches to a squeaky tune ,</l>
        <l n="23">It marches down the paper to a squealing of fifes .</l>
        <l n="24">My pen and the trumpet-flowers ,</l>
        <l n="25">And Washington 's armies away over the smoke-tree to the Southwest .</l>
        <l n="26">“ Yankee Doodle , ” my Darling ! It is you against the British ,</l>
        <l n="27">Marching in your ragged shoes to batter down King George .</l>
        <l n="28">What have you got in your hat ? Not a feather , I wager .</l>
        <l n="29">Just a hay-straw , for it is the harvest you are fighting for .</l>
        <l n="30">Hay in your hat , and the whites of their eyes for a target !</l>
        <l n="31">Like Bunker Hill , two years ago , when I watched all day from the house-top</l>
        <l n="32">Through Father 's spy-glass .</l>
        <l n="33">The red city , and the blue , bright water ,</l>
        <l n="34">And puffs of smoke which you made .</l>
        <l n="35">Twenty miles away ,</l>
        <l n="36">Round by Cambridge , or over the Neck ,</l>
        <l n="37">But the smoke was white — white !</l>
        <l n="38">To-day the trumpet-flowers are red — red —</l>
        <l n="39">And I cannot see you fighting ,</l>
        <l n="40">But old Mr. Dimond has fled to Canada ,</l>
        <l n="41">And Myra sings “ Yankee Doodle ” at her milking .</l>
        <l n="42">The red throats of the trumpets bray and clang in the sunshine ,</l>
        <l n="43">And the smoke-tree puffs dun blossoms into the blue air .</l>

       <l n="42">Anything else than the very best .</l>
       <l n="43">He pointed to baskets of blunted pears</l>
       <l n="44">With the thin skin tight like a bursting vest ,</l>
       <l n="45">All yellow , and red , and brown , in smears .</l>
       <l n="46">Monsieur Popain 's voice denoted tears .</l>
       <l n="47">He took up a pear with tender care ,</l>
       <l n="48">And pressed it with his hardened thumb .</l>
       <l n="49">“ Smell it , Mademoiselle , the perfume there</l>
       <l n="50">Is like lavender , and sweet thoughts come</l>
       <l n="51">Only from having a dish at home .</l>
       <l n="52">And those grapes ! They melt in the mouth like wine ,</l>
       <l n="53">Just a click of the tongue , and they burst to honey .</l>
       <l n="54">They 're only this morning off the vine ,</l>
       <l n="55">And I paid for them down in silver money .</l>
       <l n="56">The Corporal 's widow is witness , her pony</l>
       <l n="57">Brought them in at sunrise to-day .</l>
       <l n="58">Those oranges — Gold ! They 're almost red .</l>
       <l n="59">They seem little chips just broken away</l>
       <l n="60">From the sun itself . Or perhaps instead</l>
       <l n="61">You 'd like a pomegranate , they 're rarely gay ,</l>
       <l n="62">When you split them the seeds are like crimson spray .</l>
       <l n="63">Yes , they 're high , they 're high , and those Turkey figs ,</l>
       <l n="64">They all come from the South , and Nelson 's ships</l>
       <l n="65">Make it a little hard for our rigs .</l>
       <l n="66">They must be forever giving the slips</l>
       <l n="67">To the cursed English , and when men clips</l>
       <l n="68">Through powder to bring them , why dainties mounts</l>
       <l n="69">A bit in price . Those almonds now ,</l>
       <l n="70">I 'll strip off that husk , when one discounts</l>
       <l n="71">A life or two in a nigger row</l>
       <l n="72">With the man who grew them , it does seem how</l>
       <l n="73">They would come dear ; and then the fight</l>

       <l n="75">And mostly they sail along at night ,</l>
       <l n="76">But once in a way they 're caught ; one feels</l>
       <l n="77">Ivory 's not better nor finer — why peels</l>
       <l n="78">From an almond kernel are worth two sous .</l>

       <l n="92">She 's a poor old thing , but she learnt the trade</l>
       <l n="93">When her man was young , and the young Marquis</l>

       <l n="97">Some charge against him , a cavalcade</l>
       <l n="98">Of citizens took him away ; they meant</l>
       <l n="99">Well , but I think there was some mistake .</l>
       <l n="100">He just pottered round in his garden , bent</l>
       <l n="101">On growing things ; we were so awake</l>
       <l n="102">In those days for the New Republic 's sake .</l>
       <l n="103">He 's gone , and the garden is all that 's left</l>

       <l n="111">Jeanne Tourmont drew back the filigree ring</l>
       <l n="112">Of her striped silk purse , tipped it upside down</l>
       <l n="113">And shook it , two coins fell with a ding</l>

       <l n="127">Bustled , denied , his heart was good ,</l>
       <l n="128">But times were hard . He went to a pan</l>
       <l n="129">And poured upon the counter a flood</l>
       <l n="130">Of pungent raspberries , tanged like wood .</l>
       <l n="131">He took a melon with rough green rind</l>
       <l n="132">And rubbed it well with his apron tip .</l>
       <l n="133">Then he hunted over the shop to find</l>
       <l n="134">Some walnuts cracking at the lip ,</l>
       <l n="135">And added to these a barberry slip</l>
       <l n="136">Whose acrid , oval berries hung</l>
       <l n="137">Like fringe and trembled . He reached a round</l>
       <l n="138">Basket , with handles , from where it swung</l>
       <l n="139">Against the wall , laid it on the ground</l>
       <l n="140">And filled it , then he searched and found</l>
       <l n="141">The francs Jeanne Tourmont had let fall .</l>
       <l n="142">“ You 'll return the basket , Mademoiselle ? ”</l>
       <l n="143">She smiled , “ The next time that I call ,</l>

       <l n="151">Through glare and noise she stumbled , dazed .</l>
       <l n="152">The heavy basket was a care .</l>
       <l n="153">She heard a shout and almost grazed</l>

     <p>How the slates of the roof sparkle in the sun , over there , over there , beyond the high wall ! How quietly the Seine runs in loops and windings , over there , over there , sliding through the green countryside ! Like ships of the line , stately with canvas , the tall clouds pass along the sky , over the glittering roof , over the trees , over the looped and curving river . A breeze quivers through the linden-trees . Roses bloom at Malmaison . Roses ! Roses ! But the road is dusty . Already the Citoyenne Beauharnais wearies of her walk . Her skin is chalked and powdered with dust , she smells dust , and behind the wall are roses ! Roses with smooth open petals , poised above rippling leaves ... Roses ... They have told her so . The Citoyenne Beauharnais shrugs her shoulders and makes a little face . She must mend her pace if she would be back in time for dinner . Roses indeed ! The guillotine more likely .</p>
     <p>The tiered clouds float over Malmaison , and the slate roof sparkles in the sun .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>II</head>
      <head>Gallop ! Gallop ! The General brooks no delay . Make way , good people , and scatter out of his path , you , and your hens , and your dogs , and your children . The General is returned from Egypt , and is come in a ‘ caleche ’ and four to visit his new property . Throw open the gates , you , Porter of Malmaison . Pull off your cap , my man , this is your master , the husband of Madame . Faster ! Faster ! A jerk and a jingle and they are arrived , he and she . Madame has red eyes . Fie ! It is for joy at her husband 's return . Learn your place , Porter . A gentleman here for two months ? Fie ! Fie , then ! Since when have you taken to gossiping . Madame may have a brother , I suppose . That — all green , and red , and glitter , with flesh as dark as ebony — that is a slave ; a bloodthirsty , stabbing , slashing heathen , come from the hot countries to cure your tongue of idle whispering .</head>
       <l n="1">A fine afternoon it is , with tall bright clouds sailing over the trees .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Bonaparte , mon ami , the trees are golden like my star , the star I pinned to your destiny when I married you . The gypsy , you remember her prophecy ! My dear friend , not here , the servants are watching ; send them away , and that flashing splendour , Roustan . Superb — Imperial , but .. . My dear , your arm is trembling ; I faint to feel it touching me ! No , no , Bonaparte , not that — spare me that — did we not bury that last night ! You hurt me , my friend , you are so hot and strong . Not long , Dear , no , thank God , not long . ”</p>
     <p>The looped river runs saffron , for the sun is setting . It is getting dark . Dark . Darker . In the moonlight , the slate roof shines palely milkily white .</p>
     <p>The roses have faded at Malmaison , nipped by the frost . What need for roses ? Smooth , open petals — her arms . Fragrant , outcurved petals — her breasts . He rises like a sun above her , stooping to touch the petals , press them wider . Eagles . Bees . What are they to open roses ! A little shivering breeze runs through the linden-trees , and the tiered clouds blow across the sky like ships of the line , stately with canvas .</p>
     <p>III</p>
     <p>The gates stand wide at Malmaison , stand wide all day . The gravel of the avenue glints under the continual rolling of wheels . An officer gallops up with his sabre clicking ; a mameluke gallops down with his charger kicking . ‘ Valets de pied ’ run about in ones , and twos , and groups , like swirled blown leaves . Tramp ! Tramp ! The guard is changing , and the grenadiers off duty lounge out of sight , ranging along the roads toward Paris .</p>
     <p>The slate roof sparkles in the sun , but it sparkles milkily , vaguely , the great glass-houses put out its shining . Glass , stone , and onyx now for the sun 's mirror . Much has come to pass at Malmaison . New rocks and fountains , blocks of carven marble , fluted pillars uprearing antique temples , vases and urns in unexpected places , bridges of stone , bridges of wood , arbours and statues , and a flood of flowers everywhere , new flowers , rare flowers , parterre after parterre of flowers . Indeed , the roses bloom at Malmaison . It is youth , youth untrammeled and advancing , trundling a country ahead of it as though it were a hoop . Laughter , and spur janglings in tessellated vestibules . Tripping of clocked and embroidered stockings in little low-heeled shoes over smooth grass-plots . India muslins spangled with silver patterns slide through trees — mingle — separate — white day fireflies flashing moon-brilliance in the shade of foliage .</p>
     <p>“ The kangaroos ! I vow , Captain , I must see the kangaroos . ”</p>
     <p>“ As you please , dear Lady , but I recommend the shady linden alley and feeding the cockatoos . ”</p>

     <p>Picking , choosing , the chattering company flits to and fro . Over the trees the great clouds go , tiered , stately , like ships of the line bright with canvas .</p>
     <p>Prisoners ’ - base , and its swooping , veering , racing , giggling , bumping . The First Consul runs plump into M. de Beauharnais and falls . But he picks himself up smartly , and starts after M. Isabey . Too late , M. Le Premier Consul , Mademoiselle Hortense is out after you . Quickly , my dear Sir ! Stir your short legs , she is swift and eager , and as graceful as her mother . She is there , that other , playing too , but lightly , warily , bearing herself with care , rather floating out upon the air than running , never far from goal . She is there , borne up above her guests as something indefinably fair , a rose above periwinkles . A blown rose , smooth as satin , reflexed , one loosened petal hanging back and down . A rose that undulates languorously as the breeze takes it , resting upon its leaves in a faintness of perfume .</p>
     <p>There are rumours about the First Consul . Malmaison is full of women , and Paris is only two leagues distant . Madame Bonaparte stands on the wooden bridge at sunset , and watches a black swan pushing the pink and silver water in front of him as he swims , crinkling its smoothness into pleats of changing colour with his breast . Madame Bonaparte presses against the parapet of the bridge , and the crushed roses at her belt melt , petal by petal , into the pink water .</p>

      <head>A vile day , Porter . But keep your wits about you . The Empress will soon be here . Queer , without the Emperor ! It is indeed , but best not consider that . Scratch your head and prick up your ears . Divorce is not for you to debate about . She is late ? Ah , well , the roads are muddy . The rain spears are as sharp as whetted knives . They dart down and down , edged and shining . Clop-trop ! Clop-trop ! A carriage grows out of the mist . Hist , Porter . You can keep on your hat . It is only Her Majesty 's dogs and her parrot . Clop-trop ! The Ladies in Waiting , Porter . Clop-trop ! It is Her Majesty . At least , I suppose it is , but the blinds are drawn .</head>

     <p>White under her veil , drained and shaking , the woman crosses the antechamber . Empress ! Empress ! Foolish splendour , perished to dust . Ashes of roses , ashes of youth . Empress forsooth !</p>
     <p>Over the glass domes of the hot-houses drenches the rain . Behind her a clock ticks — ticks again . The sound knocks upon her thought with the echoing shudder of hollow vases . She places her hands on her ears , but the minutes pass , knocking . Tears in Malmaison . And years to come each knocking by , minute after minute . Years , many years , and tears , and cold pouring rain .</p>
     <p>“ I feel as though I had died , and the only sensation I have is that I am no more . ”</p>
     <p>Rain ! Heavy , thudding rain !</p>

      <head>The roses bloom at Malmaison . And not only roses . Tulips , myrtles , geraniums , camelias , rhododendrons , dahlias , double hyacinths . All the year through , under glass , under the sky , flowers bud , expand , die , and give way to others , always others . From distant countries they have been brought , and taught to live in the cool temperateness of France . There is the ‘ Bonapartea ’ from Peru ; the ‘ Napoleone Imperiale ’ ; the ‘ Josephinia Imperatrix ’ , a pearl-white flower , purple-shadowed , the calix pricked out with crimson points . Malmaison wears its flowers as a lady wears her gems , flauntingly , assertively . Malmaison decks herself to hide the hollow within .</head>
       <l n="1">The glass-houses grow and grow , and every year fling up hotter</l>
       <l n="2">reflections to the sailing sun .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The cost runs into millions , but a woman must have something to console herself for a broken heart . One can play backgammon and patience , and then patience and backgammon , and stake gold napoleons on each game won . Sport truly ! It is an unruly spirit which could ask better . With her jewels , her laces , her shawls ; her two hundred and twenty dresses , her fichus , her veils ; her pictures , her busts , her birds . It is absurd that she cannot be happy . The Emperor smarts under the thought of her ingratitude . What could he do more ? And yet she spends , spends as never before . It is ridiculous . Can she not enjoy life at a smaller figure ? Was ever monarch plagued with so extravagant an ex-wife . She owes her chocolate-merchant , her candle-merchant , her sweetmeat purveyor ; her grocer , her butcher , her poulterer ; her architect , and the shopkeeper who sells her rouge ; her perfumer , her dressmaker , her merchant of shoes . She owes for fans , plants , engravings , and chairs . She owes masons and carpenters , vintners , lingeres . The lady 's affairs are in sad confusion .</p>
     <p>And why ? Why ?</p>
     <p>Can a river flow when the spring is dry ?</p>
     <p>Night . The Empress sits alone , and the clock ticks , one after one . The clock nicks off the edges of her life . She is chipped like an old bit of china ; she is frayed like a garment of last year 's wearing . She is soft , crinkled , like a fading rose . And each minute flows by brushing against her , shearing off another and another petal . The Empress crushes her breasts with her hands and weeps . And the tall clouds sail over Malmaison like a procession of stately ships bound for the moon .</p>
     <p>Scarlet , clear-blue , purple epauletted with gold . It is a parade of soldiers sweeping up the avenue . Eight horses , eight Imperial harnesses , four caparisoned postilions , a carriage with the Emperor 's arms on the panels . Ho , Porter , pop out your eyes , and no wonder . Where else under the Heavens could you see such splendour !</p>
     <p>They sit on a stone seat . The little man in the green coat of a Colonel of Chasseurs , and the lady , beautiful as a satin seed-pod , and as pale . The house has memories . The satin seed-pod holds his germs of Empire . We will stay here , under the blue sky and the turreted white clouds . She draws him ; he feels her faded loveliness urge him to replenish it . Her soft transparent texture woos his nervous fingering . He speaks to her of debts , of resignation ; of her children , and his ; he promises that she shall see the King of Rome ; he says some harsh things and some pleasant . But she is there , close to him , rose toned to amber , white shot with violet , pungent to his nostrils as embalmed rose-leaves in a twilit room .</p>
     <p>Suddenly the Emperor calls his carriage and rolls away across the looping Seine .</p>
     <p>VI</p>
     <p>Crystal-blue brightness over the glass-houses . Crystal-blue streaks and ripples over the lake . A macaw on a gilded perch screams ; they have forgotten to take out his dinner . The windows shake . Boom ! Boom ! It is the rumbling of Prussian cannon beyond Pecq . Roses bloom at Malmaison . Roses ! Roses ! Swimming above their leaves , rotting beneath them . Fallen flowers strew the unraked walks . Fallen flowers for a fallen Emperor ! The General in charge of him draws back and watches . Snatches of music — snarling , sneering music of bagpipes . They say a Scotch regiment is besieging Saint-Denis . The Emperor wipes his face , or is it his eyes . His tired eyes which see nowhere the grace they long for . Josephine ! Somebody asks him a question , he does not answer , somebody else does that . There are voices , but one voice he does not hear , and yet he hears it all the time . Josephine ! The Emperor puts up his hand to screen his face . The white light of a bright cloud spears sharply through the linden-trees . ‘ Vive l'Empereur ! ’ There are troops passing beyond the wall , troops which sing and call . Boom ! A pink rose is jarred off its stem and falls at the Emperor 's feet .</p>
     <p>“ Very well . I go . ” Where ! Does it matter ? There is no sword to clatter . Nothing but soft brushing gravel and a gate which shuts with a click .</p>
     <p>“ Quick , fellow , do n't spare your horses . ”</p>
     <p>A whip cracks , wheels turn , why burn one 's eyes following a fleck of dust .</p>
     <p>VII</p>
     <p>Over the slate roof tall clouds , like ships of the line , pass along the sky . The glass-houses glitter splotchily , for many of their lights are broken . Roses bloom , fiery cinders quenching under damp weeds . Wreckage and misery , and a trailing of petty deeds smearing over old recollections .</p>
     <p>The musty rooms are empty and their shutters are closed , only in the gallery there is a stuffed black swan , covered with dust . When you touch it , the feathers come off and float softly to the ground . Through a chink in the shutters , one can see the stately clouds crossing the sky toward the Roman arches of the Marly Aqueduct .</p>

     <p>Fine yellow sunlight down the rue du Mont Thabor . Ten o'clock striking from all the clock-towers of Paris . Over the door of a shop , in gilt letters : “ Martin — Parfumeur ” , and something more . A large gilded wooden something . Listen ! What a ringing of hammers ! Tap ! Tap ! Squeak ! Tap ! Squeak ! Tap-a-tap ! “ Blaise . ” “ Oui , M'sieu . ” “ Do n't touch the letters . My name stays . ” “ Bien , M'sieu . ” “ Just take down the eagle , and the shield with the bees . ” “ As M'sieu pleases . ” Tap ! Squeak ! Tap ! The man on the ladder hammers steadily for a minute or two , Then stops . “ He ! Patron ! They are fastened well , Nom d'un Chien ! What if I break them ? ” “ Break away , You and Paul must have them down to-day . ” “ Bien . ” And the hammers start again , Drum-beating at the something of gilded wood . Sunshine in a golden flood Lighting up the yellow fronts of houses , Glittering each window to a flash . Squeak ! Squeak ! Tap ! The hammers beat and rap . A Prussian hussar on a grey horse goes by at a dash . From other shops , the noise of striking blows : Pounds , thumps , and whacks ; Wooden sounds : splinters — cracks . Paris is full of the galloping of horses and the knocking of hammers . “ Hullo ! Friend Martin , is business slack That you are in the street this morning ? Do n't turn your back And scuttle into your shop like a rabbit to its hole . I 've just been taking a stroll . The stinking Cossacks are bivouacked all up and down the Champs Elysees . I can n't get the smell of them out of my nostrils . Dirty fellows , who do n't believe in frills Like washing . Ah , mon vieux , you 'd have to go Out of business if you lived in Russia . So ! We 've given up being perfumers to the Emperor , have we ? Blaise , Be careful of the hen , Maybe I can find a use for her one of these days . That eagle 's rather well cut , Martin . But I 'm sick of smelling Cossack , Take me inside and let me put my head into a stack Of orris-root and musk . ” Within the shop , the light is dimmed to a pearl-and-green dusk Out of which dreamily sparkle counters and shelves of glass , Containing phials , and bowls , and jars , and dishes ; a mass Of aqueous transparence made solid by threads of gold . Gold and glass , And scents which whiff across the green twilight and pass . The perfumer sits down and shakes his head : “ Always the same , Monsieur Antoine , You artists are wonderful folk indeed . ” But Antoine Vernet does not heed . He is reading the names on the bottles and bowls , Done in fine gilt letters with wonderful scrolls . “ What have we here ? ‘ Eau Imperial Odontalgique . ’ I must say , mon cher , your names are chic . But it wo n't do , positively it will not do . Elba does n't count . Ah , here is another : ‘ Baume du Commandeur ’ . That 's better . He needs something to smother Regrets . A little lubricant , too , Might be useful . I have it , ‘ Sage Oil ’ , perhaps he 'll be good now ; with it we 'll submit This fine German rouge . I fear he is pale . ” “ Monsieur Antoine , do n't rail At misfortune . He treated me well and fairly . ” “ And you prefer him to Bourbons , admit it squarely . ” “ Heaven forbid ! ” Bang ! Whack ! Squeak ! Squeak ! Crack ! CRASH ! “ Oh , Lord , Martin ! That shield is hash . The whole street is covered with golden bees . They look like so many yellow peas , Lying there in the mud . I 'd like to paint it . ‘ Plum pudding of Empire ’ . That 's rather quaint , it Might take with the Kings . Shall I try ? ” “ Oh , Sir , You distress me , you do . ” “ Poor old Martin 's purr ! But he has n't a scratch in him , I know . Now let us get back to the powders and patches . Foolish man , The Kings are here now . We must hit on a plan To change all these titles as fast as we can . ‘ Bouquet Imperatrice ’ . Tut ! Tut ! Give me some ink — ‘ Bouquet de la Reine ’ , what do you think ? Not the same receipt ? Now , Martin , put away your conceit . Who will ever know ? ‘ Extract of Nobility ’ — excellent , since most of them are killed . ” “ But , Monsieur Antoine — ” “ You are self-willed , Martin . You need a salve For your conscience , do you ? Very well , we 'll halve The compliments , also the pastes and dentifrices ; Send some to the Kings , and some to the Empresses . ‘ Oil of Bitter Almonds ’ — the Empress Josephine can have that . ‘ Oil of Parma Violets ’ fits the other one pat . ” Rap ! Rap ! Bang ! “ What a hideous clatter ! Blaise seems determined to batter That poor old turkey into bits , And pound to jelly my excellent wits . Come , come , Martin , you must n't shirk . ‘ The night cometh soon ’ — etc . Do n't jerk Me up like that . ‘ Essence de la Valliere ’ — That has a charmingly Bourbon air . And , oh ! Magnificent ! Listen to this !— ‘ Vinaigre des Quatre Voleurs ’ . Nothing amiss With that — England , Austria , Russia and Prussia ! Martin , you 're a wonder , Upheavals of continents can n't keep you under . ” “ Monsieur Antoine , I am grieved indeed At such levity . What France has gone through — ” “ Very true , Martin , very true , But never forget that a man must feed . ” Pound ! Pound ! Thump ! Pound ! “ Look here , in another minute Blaise will drop that bird on the ground . ” Martin shrugs his shoulders . “ Ah , well , what then ?— ” Antoine , with a laugh : “ I 'll give you two sous for that antiquated hen . ” The Imperial Eagle sells for two sous , And the lilies go up . A man must choose !</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Into the brazen , burnished sky , the cry hurls itself . The zigzagging cry of hoarse throats , it floats against the hard winds , and binds the head of the serpent to its tail , the long snail-slow serpent of marching men . Men weighed down with rifles and knapsacks , and parching with war . The cry jars and splits against the brazen , burnished sky .</p>
     <p>This is the war of wars , and the cause ? Has this writhing worm of men a cause ?</p>
     <p>Crackling against the polished sky is an eagle with a sword . The eagle is red and its head is flame .</p>
     <p>In the shoulder of the worm is a teacher .</p>
     <p>His tongue laps the war-sucked air in drought , but he yells defiance at the red-eyed eagle , and in his ears are the bells of new philosophies , and their tinkling drowns the sputter of the burning sword . He shrieks , “ God damn you ! When you are broken , the word will strike out new shoots . ”</p>
     <p>His boots are tight , the sun is hot , and he may be shot , but he is in the shoulder of the worm .</p>
     <p>A dust speck in the worm 's belly is a poet .</p>
     <p>He laughs at the flaring eagle and makes a long nose with his fingers . He will fight for smooth , white sheets of paper , and uncurdled ink . The sputtering sword cannot make him blink , and his thoughts are wet and rippling . They cool his heart .</p>
     <p>He will tear the eagle out of the sky and give the earth tranquillity , and loveliness printed on white paper .</p>
     <p>The eye of the serpent is an owner of mills .</p>
     <p>He looks at the glaring sword which has snapped his machinery and struck away his men .</p>
     <p>But it will all come again , when the sword is broken to a million dying stars , and there are no more wars .</p>
     <p>Bankers , butchers , shop-keepers , painters , farmers — men , sway and sweat . They will fight for the earth , for the increase of the slow , sure roots of peace , for the release of hidden forces . They jibe at the eagle and his scorching sword .</p>
     <p>One ! Two !— One ! Two !— clump the heavy boots . The cry hurtles against the sky .</p>
     <p>Each man pulls his belt a little tighter , and shifts his gun to make it lighter . Each man thinks of a woman , and slaps out a curse at the eagle . The sword jumps in the hot sky , and the worm crawls on to the battle , stubbornly .</p>
     <p>This is the war of wars , from eye to tail the serpent has one cause : PEACE !</p>
     <p>The Bombardment</p>
     <p>Slowly , without force , the rain drops into the city . It stops a moment on the carved head of Saint John , then slides on again , slipping and trickling over his stone cloak . It splashes from the lead conduit of a gargoyle , and falls from it in turmoil on the stones in the Cathedral square . Where are the people , and why does the fretted steeple sweep about in the sky ? Boom ! The sound swings against the rain . Boom , again ! After it , only water rushing in the gutters , and the turmoil from the spout of the gargoyle . Silence . Ripples and mutters . Boom !</p>
     <p>The room is damp , but warm . Little flashes swarm about from the firelight . The lustres of the chandelier are bright , and clusters of rubies leap in the bohemian glasses on the ‘ etagere ’ . Her hands are restless , but the white masses of her hair are quite still . Boom ! Will it never cease to torture , this iteration ! Boom ! The vibration shatters a glass on the ‘ etagere ’ . It lies there , formless and glowing , with all its crimson gleams shot out of pattern , spilled , flowing red , blood-red . A thin bell-note pricks through the silence . A door creaks . The old lady speaks : “ Victor , clear away that broken glass . ” “ Alas ! Madame , the bohemian glass ! ” “ Yes , Victor , one hundred years ago my father brought it — ” Boom ! The room shakes , the servitor quakes . Another goblet shivers and breaks . Boom !</p>
     <p>It rustles at the window-pane , the smooth , streaming rain , and he is shut within its clash and murmur . Inside is his candle , his table , his ink , his pen , and his dreams . He is thinking , and the walls are pierced with beams of sunshine , slipping through young green . A fountain tosses itself up at the blue sky , and through the spattered water in the basin he can see copper carp , lazily floating among cold leaves . A wind-harp in a cedar-tree grieves and whispers , and words blow into his brain , bubbled , iridescent , shooting up like flowers of fire , higher and higher . Boom ! The flame-flowers snap on their slender stems . The fountain rears up in long broken spears of dishevelled water and flattens into the earth . Boom ! And there is only the room , the table , the candle , and the sliding rain . Again , Boom !— Boom !— Boom ! He stuffs his fingers into his ears . He sees corpses , and cries out in fright . Boom ! It is night , and they are shelling the city ! Boom ! Boom !</p>

       <l n="1">A child wakes and is afraid , and weeps in the darkness . What has made</l>

       <l n="5">“ Where is Father ? I am so afraid . ” Boom ! The child sobs and shrieks .</l>

     </lg>
     <p>Retorts , globes , tubes , and phials lie shattered . All his trials oozing across the floor . The life that was his choosing , lonely , urgent , goaded by a hope , all gone . A weary man in a ruined laboratory , that is his story . Boom ! Gloom and ignorance , and the jig of drunken brutes . Diseases like snakes crawling over the earth , leaving trails of slime . Wails from people burying their dead . Through the window , he can see the rocking steeple . A ball of fire falls on the lead of the roof , and the sky tears apart on a spike of flame . Up the spire , behind the lacings of stone , zigzagging in and out of the carved tracings , squirms the fire . It spouts like yellow wheat from the gargoyles , coils round the head of Saint John , and aureoles him in light . It leaps into the night and hisses against the rain . The Cathedral is a burning stain on the white , wet night .</p>
     <p>Boom ! The Cathedral is a torch , and the houses next to it begin to scorch . Boom ! The bohemian glass on the ‘ etagere ’ is no longer there . Boom ! A stalk of flame sways against the red damask curtains . The old lady cannot walk . She watches the creeping stalk and counts . Boom !— Boom !— Boom !</p>
     <p>The poet rushes into the street , and the rain wraps him in a sheet of silver . But it is threaded with gold and powdered with scarlet beads . The city burns . Quivering , spearing , thrusting , lapping , streaming , run the flames . Over roofs , and walls , and shops , and stalls . Smearing its gold on the sky , the fire dances , lances itself through the doors , and lisps and chuckles along the floors .</p>
     <p>The child wakes again and screams at the yellow petalled flower flickering at the window . The little red lips of flame creep along the ceiling beams .</p>
     <p>The old man sits among his broken experiments and looks at the burning Cathedral . Now the streets are swarming with people . They seek shelter and crowd into the cellars . They shout and call , and over all , slowly and without force , the rain drops into the city . Boom ! And the steeple crashes down among the people . Boom ! Boom , again ! The water rushes along the gutters . The fire roars and mutters . Boom !</p>
     <p>Lead Soldiers</p>
     <p>The nursery fire burns brightly , crackling in cheerful little explosions and trails of sparks up the back of the chimney . Miniature rockets peppering the black bricks with golden stars , as though a gala flamed a night of victorious wars .</p>
     <p>The nodding mandarin on the bookcase moves his head forward and back , slowly , and looks into the air with his blue-green eyes . He stares into the air and nods — forward and back . The red rose in his hand is a crimson splash on his yellow coat . Forward and back , and his blue-green eyes stare into the air , and he nods — nods .</p>

       <l n="4">How the horses snort and prance !</l>
       <l n="5">Cannon drawn up in a line</l>
       <l n="6">Glitter in the dizzy shine</l>
       <l n="7">Of the morning sunlight . Flags</l>
       <l n="8">Ripple colours in great jags .</l>
       <l n="9">Red blows out , then blue , then green ,</l>
       <l n="10">Then all three — a weaving sheen</l>
       <l n="11">Of prismed patriotism . March</l>
       <l n="12">Tommy 's soldiers , stiff and starch ,</l>
       <l n="13">Boldly stepping to the rattle</l>
       <l n="14">Of the drums , they go to battle .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Tommy lies on his stomach on the floor and directs his columns . He puts his infantry in front , and before them ambles a mounted band . Their instruments make a strand of gold before the scarlet-tunicked soldiers , and they take very long steps on their little green platforms , and from the ranks bursts the song of Tommy 's soldiers marching to battle . The song jolts a little as the green platforms stick on the thick carpet . Tommy wheels his guns round the edge of a box of blocks , and places a squad of cavalry on the commanding eminence of a footstool .</p>
     <p>The fire snaps pleasantly , and the old Chinaman nods — nods . The fire makes the red rose in his hand glow and twist . Hist ! That is a bold song Tommy 's soldiers sing as they march along to battle .</p>
     <p>Crack ! Rattle ! The sparks fly up the chimney .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Tommy 's army 's off to war —</l>
       <l n="2">Not a soldier knows what for .</l>
       <l n="3">But he knows about his rifle ,</l>
       <l n="4">How to shoot it , and a trifle</l>
       <l n="5">Of the proper thing to do</l>
       <l n="6">When it 's he who is shot through .</l>
       <l n="7">Like a cleverly trained flea ,</l>
       <l n="8">He can follow instantly</l>
       <l n="9">Orders , and some quick commands</l>
       <l n="10">Really make severe demands</l>
       <l n="11">On a mind that 's none too rapid ,</l>
       <l n="12">Leaden brains tend to the vapid .</l>
       <l n="13">But how beautifully dressed</l>
       <l n="14">Is this army ! How impressed</l>
       <l n="15">Tommy is when at his heel</l>
       <l n="16">All his baggage wagons wheel</l>
       <l n="17">About the patterned carpet , and</l>
       <l n="18">Moving up his heavy guns</l>
       <l n="19">He sees them glow with diamond suns</l>
       <l n="20">Flashing all along each barrel .</l>
       <l n="21">And the gold and blue apparel</l>
       <l n="22">Of his gunners is a joy .</l>
       <l n="23">Tommy is a lucky boy .</l>
       <l n="24">Boom ! Boom ! Ta-ra !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The old mandarin nods under his purple umbrella . The rose in his hand shoots its petals up in thin quills of crimson . Then they collapse and shrivel like red embers . The fire sizzles .</p>
     <p>Tommy is galloping his cavalry , two by two , over the floor . They must pass the open terror of the door and gain the enemy encamped under the wash-stand . The mounted band is very grand , playing allegro and leading the infantry on at the double quick . The tassel of the hearth-rug has flung down the bass-drum , and he and his dapple-grey horse lie overtripped , slipped out of line , with the little lead drumsticks glistening to the fire 's shine .</p>
     <p>The fire burns and crackles , and tickles the tripped bass-drum with its sparkles .</p>
     <p>The marching army hitches its little green platforms valiantly , and steadily approaches the door . The overturned bass-drummer , lying on the hearth-rug , melting in the heat , softens and sheds tears . The song jeers at his impotence , and flaunts the glory of the martial and still upstanding , vaunting the deeds it will do . For are not Tommy 's soldiers all bright and new ?</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Tommy 's leaden soldiers we ,</l>
       <l n="2">Glittering with efficiency .</l>
       <l n="3">Not a button 's out of place ,</l>
       <l n="4">Tons and tons of golden lace</l>
       <l n="5">Wind about our officers .</l>
       <l n="6">Every manly bosom stirs</l>
       <l n="7">At the thought of killing — killing !</l>
       <l n="8">Tommy 's dearest wish fulfilling .</l>
       <l n="9">We are gaudy , savage , strong ,</l>
       <l n="10">And our loins so ripe we long</l>
       <l n="11">First to kill , then procreate ,</l>
       <l n="12">Doubling so the laws of Fate .</l>
       <l n="13">On their women we have sworn</l>
       <l n="14">To graft our sons . And overborne</l>
       <l n="15">They 'll rear us younger soldiers , so</l>
       <l n="16">Shall our race endure and grow ,</l>
       <l n="17">Waxing greater in the wombs</l>
       <l n="18">Borrowed of them , while damp tombs</l>
       <l n="19">Rot their men . O Glorious War !</l>
       <l n="20">Goad us with your points , Great Star !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The china mandarin on the bookcase nods slowly , forward and back — forward and back — and the red rose writhes and wriggles , thrusting its flaming petals under and over one another like tortured snakes .</p>
     <p>The fire strokes them with its dartles , and purrs at them , and the old man nods .</p>
     <p>Tommy does not hear the song . He only sees the beautiful , new , gaily-coloured lead soldiers . They belong to him , and he is very proud and happy . He shouts his orders aloud , and gallops his cavalry past the door to the wash-stand . He creeps over the floor on his hands and knees to one battalion and another , but he sees only the bright colours of his soldiers and the beautiful precision of their gestures . He is a lucky boy to have such fine lead soldiers to enjoy .</p>
     <p>Tommy catches his toe in the leg of the wash-stand , and jars the pitcher . He snatches at it with his hands , but it is too late . The pitcher falls , and as it goes , he sees the white water flow over its lip . It slips between his fingers and crashes to the floor . But it is not water which oozes to the door . The stain is glutinous and dark , a spark from the firelight heads it to red . In and out , between the fine , new soldiers , licking over the carpet , squirms the stream of blood , lapping at the little green platforms , and flapping itself against the painted uniforms .</p>
     <p>The nodding mandarin moves his head slowly , forward and back . The rose is broken , and where it fell is black blood . The old mandarin leers under his purple umbrella , and nods — forward and back , staring into the air with blue-green eyes . Every time his head comes forward a rosebud pushes between his lips , rushes into full bloom , and drips to the ground with a splashing sound . The pool of black blood grows and grows , with each dropped rose , and spreads out to join the stream from the wash-stand . The beautiful army of lead soldiers steps boldly forward , but the little green platforms are covered in the rising stream of blood .</p>
     <p>The nursery fire burns brightly and flings fan-bursts of stars up the chimney , as though a gala flamed a night of victorious wars .</p>

       <l n="33">An ’ a mopey wife kind o ’ disgusts a man .</l>
       <l n="34">I ai n't blamin ’ yer exactly .</l>
       <l n="35">But that 's how ‘ twas .</l>
       <l n="36">Do lay quiet ,</l>
       <l n="37">I know I 'm slow , but it 's harder to say ‘ n I thought .</l>
       <l n="38">There come a time when I got to be</l>
       <l n="39">More wife agin than mother .</l>
       <l n="40">The mother part was sort of a waste</l>
       <l n="41">When we did n't have no other child .</l>
       <l n="42">But you 'd got used ter lots o ’ things ,</l>
       <l n="43">An ’ you was all took up with the farm .</l>
       <l n="44">Many 's the time I 've laid awake</l>
       <l n="45">Watchin ’ the moon go clear through the elm-tree ,</l>
       <l n="46">Out o ’ sight .</l>
       <l n="47">I 'd foller yer around like a dog ,</l>
       <l n="48">An ’ set in the chair you 'd be'n settin ’ in ,</l>
       <l n="49">Jest to feel its arms around me ,</l>
       <l n="50">So long 's I did n't have yours .</l>
       <l n="51">It preyed on me , I guess ,</l>
       <l n="52">Longin ’ and longin ’</l>
       <l n="53">While you was busy all day , and snorin ’ all night .</l>
       <l n="54">Yes , I know you 're wide awake now ,</l>
       <l n="55">But now ai n't then ,</l>
       <l n="56">An ’ I guess you 'll think diff'rent</l>
       <l n="57">When I 'm done .</l>
       <l n="58">Do you mind the day you went to Hadrock ?</l>
       <l n="59">I did n't want to stay home for reasons ,</l>
       <l n="60">But you said someone ‘ d have to be here</l>
       <l n="61">‘ Cause Elmer was comin ’ to see t ’ th ’ telephone .</l>
       <l n="62">An ’ you never see why I was so set on goin ’ with yer ,</l>
       <l n="63">Our married life had n't be'n any great shakes ,</l>
       <l n="64">Still marriage is marriage , an ’ I was raised God-fearin ’ .</l>
       <l n="65">But , Lord , you did n't notice nothin ’ ,</l>
       <l n="66">An ’ Elmer hangin ’ around all Winter !</l>
       <l n="67">‘ Twas a lovely mornin ’ .</l>
       <l n="68">The apple-trees was jest elegant</l>
       <l n="69">With their blossoms all flared out ,</l>
       <l n="70">An ’ there war n't a cloud in the sky .</l>
       <l n="71">You went , you would n't pay no ‘ tention to what I said ,</l>
       <l n="72">An ’ I heard the Ford chuggin ’ for most a mile ,</l>
       <l n="73">The air was so still .</l>
       <l n="74">Then Elmer come .</l>
       <l n="75">It 's no use your frettin ’ , Jake ,</l>
       <l n="76">I 'll tell you all about it .</l>
       <l n="77">I know what I 'm doin ’ ,</l>
       <l n="78">An ’ what 's worse , I know what I done .</l>
       <l n="79">Elmer fixed th ’ telephone in about two minits ,</l>
       <l n="80">An ’ he did n't seem in no hurry to go ,</l>
       <l n="81">An ’ I do n't know as I wanted him to go either ,</l>
       <l n="82">I was awful mad at your not takin ’ me with yer ,</l>
       <l n="83">An ’ I was tired o ’ wishin ’ and wishin ’</l>
       <l n="84">An ’ gittin ’ no comfort .</l>
       <l n="85">I guess it ai n't necessary to tell yer all the things .</l>
       <l n="86">He stayed to dinner ,</l>
       <l n="87">An ’ he helped me do the dishes ,</l>
       <l n="88">An ’ he said a home was a fine thing ,</l>
       <l n="89">An ’ I said dishes war n't a home</l>
       <l n="90">Nor yet the room they 're in .</l>
       <l n="91">He said a lot o ’ things ,</l>
       <l n="92">An ’ I fended him off at first ,</l>
       <l n="93">But he got talkin ’ all around me ,</l>
       <l n="94">Clost up to the things I 'd be'n thinkin ’ ,</l>
       <l n="95">What 's the use o ’ me goin ’ on , Jake ,</l>
       <l n="96">You know .</l>
       <l n="97">He got all he wanted ,</l>
       <l n="98">An ’ I give it to him ,</l>
       <l n="99">An ’ what 's more , I 'm glad !</l>
       <l n="100">I ai n't dead , anyway ,</l>
       <l n="101">An ’ somebody thinks I 'm somethin ’ .</l>
       <l n="102">Keep away , Jake ,</l>
       <l n="103">You can kill me to-morrer if you want to ,</l>
       <l n="104">But I 'm goin ’ to have my say .</l>
       <l n="105">Funny thing ! Guess I ai n't made to hold a man .</l>
       <l n="106">Elmer ai n't be'n here for mor'n two months .</l>
       <l n="107">I do n't want to pretend nothin ’ ,</l>
       <l n="108">Mebbe if he 'd be'n lately</l>
       <l n="109">I should n't have told yer .</l>
       <l n="110">I 'll go away in the mornin ’ , o ’ course .</l>
       <l n="111">What you want the light fer ?</l>
       <l n="112">I do n't look no diff'rent .</l>
       <l n="113">Ai n't the moon bright enough</l>
       <l n="114">To look at a woman that 's deceived yer by ?</l>
       <l n="115">Do n't , Jake , do n't , you can n't love me now !</l>
       <l n="116">It ai n't a question of forgiveness .</l>
       <l n="117">Why ! I 'd be thinkin ’ o ’ Elmer ev'ry minute ;</l>
       <l n="118">It ai n't decent .</l>
       <l n="119">Oh , my God ! It ai n't decent any more either way !</l>

       <l n="189">Mebbe you 'll mind that afore that</l>

       <l n="197">With jest a hired boy , Clarence King , ‘ twas ,</l>

       <l n="199">Well , that eighteenth o ’ June</l>

       <l n="205">Somehow or another I thought ‘ twould be pretty outdoors .</l>
       <l n="206">I got settled for pretty things that night , I guess .</l>
       <l n="207">I ai n't stuck on ‘ em no more .</l>
       <l n="208">Well , them laylock bushes side o ’ th ’ house</l>
       <l n="209">Was real lovely .</l>
       <l n="210">Glitt'rin ’ and shakin ’ in the moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="211">An ’ the smell o ’ them rose right up</l>
       <l n="212">An ’ most took my breath away .</l>
       <l n="213">The colour o ’ the spikes was all faded out ,</l>
       <l n="214">They never keep their colour when the moon 's on ‘ em ,</l>
       <l n="215">But the smell fair ‘ toxicated me .</l>
       <l n="216">I was al'ays partial to a sweet scent ,</l>
       <l n="217">An ’ I went close up t ’ th ’ bushes</l>
       <l n="218">So 's to put my face right into a flower .</l>
       <l n="219">Mis ’ Priest , jest 's I got breathin ’ in that laylock bloom</l>
       <l n="220">I saw , layin ’ right at my feet ,</l>
       <l n="221">A man 's hand !</l>
       <l n="222">It was as white 's the side o ’ th ’ house ,</l>
       <l n="223">And sparklin ’ like that lum'nous paint they put on gate-posts .</l>
       <l n="224">I screamed right out ,</l>
       <l n="225">I could n't help it ,</l>
       <l n="226">An ’ I could hear my scream</l>
       <l n="227">Goin ’ over an ’ over</l>
       <l n="228">In that echo be'ind th ’ barn .</l>
       <l n="229">Hearin ’ it agin an ’ agin like that</l>
       <l n="230">Scared me so , I dar'sn ' t scream any more .</l>
       <l n="231">I jest stood ther ,</l>
       <l n="232">And looked at that hand .</l>
       <l n="233">I thought the echo 'd begin to hammer like my heart ,</l>
       <l n="234">But it did n't .</l>
       <l n="235">There was only th ’ wind ,</l>
       <l n="236">Sighin ’ through the laylock leaves ,</l>
       <l n="237">An ’ slappin ’ ‘ em up agin the house .</l>
       <l n="238">Well , I guess I looked at that hand</l>
       <l n="239">Most ten minits ,</l>
       <l n="240">An ’ it never moved ,</l>
       <l n="241">Jest lay there white as white .</l>
       <l n="242">After a while I got to thinkin ’ that o ’ course</l>
       <l n="243">‘ Twas some drunken tramp over from Redfield .</l>
       <l n="244">That calmed me some ,</l>
       <l n="245">An ’ I commenced to think I 'd better git him out</l>
       <l n="246">From under them laylocks .</l>
       <l n="247">I planned to drag him in t ’ th ’ barn</l>
       <l n="248">An ’ lock him in ther till Clarence come in th ’ mornin ’ .</l>
       <l n="249">I got so mad thinkin ’ o ’ that all-fired brazen tramp</l>
       <l n="250">Asleep in my laylocks ,</l>
       <l n="251">I jest stooped down and grabbed th ’ hand and give it an awful pull .</l>
       <l n="252">Then I bumped right down settin ’ on the ground .</l>
       <l n="253">Mis ’ Priest , ther war n't no body come with the hand .</l>
       <l n="254">No , it ai n't cold , it 's jest that I can n't abear thinkin ’ of it ,</l>
       <l n="255">Ev'n now .</l>
       <l n="256">I 'll take a sip o ’ tea .</l>
       <l n="257">Thank you , Mis ’ Priest , that 's better .</l>
       <l n="258">I 'd ruther finish now I 've begun .</l>
       <l n="259">Thank you , jest the same .</l>
       <l n="260">I dropped the hand 's ef it 'd be'n red hot</l>
       <l n="261">‘ Stead o ’ ice cold .</l>
       <l n="262">Fer a minit or two I jest laid on that grass</l>
       <l n="263">Pantin ’ .</l>
       <l n="264">Then I up and run to them laylocks</l>
       <l n="265">An ’ pulled ‘ em every which way .</l>
       <l n="266">True es I 'm settin ’ here , Mis ’ Priest ,</l>
       <l n="267">Ther war n't nothin ’ ther .</l>
       <l n="268">I peeked an ’ pryed all about ‘ em ,</l>

       <l n="270">Neither livin ’ nor dead .</l>
       <l n="271">But the hand was ther all right ,</l>
       <l n="272">Upside down , the way I 'd dropped it ,</l>
       <l n="273">And glist'nin ’ fit to dazzle yer .</l>
       <l n="274">I do n't know how I done it ,</l>
       <l n="275">An ’ I do n't know why I done it ,</l>
       <l n="276">But I wanted to git that dret'ful hand out o ’ sight</l>
       <l n="277">I got in t ’ th ’ barn , somehow ,</l>
       <l n="278">An ’ felt roun ’ till I got a spade .</l>
       <l n="279">I could n't stop fer a lantern ,</l>
       <l n="280">Besides , the moonlight was bright enough in all conscience .</l>
       <l n="281">Then I scooped that awful thing up in th ’ spade .</l>
       <l n="282">I had a sight o ’ trouble doin ’ it .</l>
       <l n="283">It slid off , and tipped over , and I could n't bear</l>
       <l n="284">Ev'n to touch it with my foot to prop it ,</l>
       <l n="285">But I done it somehow .</l>
       <l n="286">Then I carried it off be'ind the barn ,</l>
       <l n="287">Clost to an old apple-tree</l>
       <l n="288">Where you could n't see from the house ,</l>
       <l n="289">An ’ I buried it ,</l>

       <l n="305">They was awful days after that , Mis ’ Priest ,</l>
       <l n="306">I used ter go every mornin ’ and poke about them bushes ,</l>
       <l n="307">An ’ up and down the fence ,</l>
       <l n="308">Ter find the body that hand come off of .</l>
       <l n="309">But I could n't never find nothin ’ .</l>
       <l n="310">I 'd lay awake nights</l>
       <l n="311">Hearin ’ them laylocks blowin ’ and whiskin ’ .</l>
       <l n="312">At last I had Clarence cut ‘ em down</l>
       <l n="313">An ’ make a big bonfire of ‘ em .</l>
       <l n="314">I told him the smell made me sick ,</l>
       <l n="315">An ’ that war n't no lie ,</l>
       <l n="316">I can n't abear the smell on ‘ em now ;</l>
       <l n="317">An ’ no wonder , es you say .</l>
       <l n="318">I fretted somethin ’ awful ‘ bout that hand</l>
       <l n="319">I wondered , could it be Hiram 's ,</l>
       <l n="320">But folks do n't rob graveyards hereabouts .</l>
       <l n="321">Besides , Hiram 's hands war n't that awful , starin ’ white .</l>
       <l n="322">I give up seein ’ people ,</l>
       <l n="323">I was afeared I 'd say somethin ’ .</l>
       <l n="324">You know what folks thought o ’ me</l>
       <l n="325">Better'n I do , I dessay ,</l>
       <l n="326">But mebbe now you 'll see I could n't do nothin ’ diff'rent .</l>
       <l n="327">But I stuck it out ,</l>
       <l n="328">I war n't goin ’ to be downed</l>
       <l n="329">By no loose hand , no matter how it come ther</l>
       <l n="330">But that ai n't the worst , Mis ’ Priest ,</l>
       <l n="331">Not by a long ways .</l>
       <l n="332">Two year ago , Mr. Densmore made me an offer for Cherry 's Orchard .</l>
       <l n="333">Well , I 'd got used to th ’ thought o ’ bein ’ sort o ’ blighted ,</l>
       <l n="334">An ’ I war n't scared no more .</l>
       <l n="335">Lived down my fear , I guess .</l>
       <l n="336">I 'd kinder got used to th ’ thought o ’ that awful night ,</l>
       <l n="337">And I did n't mope much about it .</l>
       <l n="338">Only I never went out o ’ doors by moonlight ;</l>
       <l n="339">That stuck .</l>
       <l n="340">Well , when Mr. Densmore 's offer come ,</l>
       <l n="341">I started thinkin ’ ‘ bout the place</l>
       <l n="342">An ’ all the things that had gone on ther .</l>
       <l n="343">Thinks I , I guess I 'll go and see where I put the hand .</l>
       <l n="344">I was foolhardy with the long time that had gone by .</l>
       <l n="345">I know 'd the place real well ,</l>
       <l n="346">Fer I 'd put it right in between two o ’ the apple roots .</l>
       <l n="347">I do n't know what possessed me , Mis ’ Priest ,</l>
       <l n="348">But I kinder wanted to know</l>
       <l n="349">That the hand had been flesh and bone , anyway .</l>
       <l n="350">It had sorter bothered me , thinkin ’ I might ha ’ imagined it .</l>
       <l n="351">I took a mornin ’ when the sun was real pleasant and warm ;</l>
       <l n="352">I guessed I would n't jump for a few old bones .</l>
       <l n="353">But I did jump , somethin ’ wicked .</l>
       <l n="354">Ther war n't no bones !</l>
       <l n="355">Ther war n't nothin ’ !</l>
       <l n="356">Not ev'n the gold ring I 'd minded bein ’ on the little finger .</l>
       <l n="357">I do n't know ef ther ever was anythin ’ .</l>
       <l n="358">I 've worried myself sick over it .</l>
       <l n="359">I be'n diggin ’ and diggin ’ day in and day out</l>
       <l n="360">Till Clarence ketched me at it .</l>
       <l n="361">Oh , I know 'd real well what you all thought ,</l>
       <l n="362">An ’ I ai n't sayin ’ you 're not right ,</l>
       <l n="363">But I ai n't goin ’ to end in no county ‘ sylum</l>
       <l n="364">If I c'n help it .</l>
       <l n="365">The shiv'rin ’ fits come on me sudden like .</l>
       <l n="366">I know ‘ em , do n't you trouble .</l>
       <l n="367">I 've fretted considerable about the ‘ sylum ,</l>
       <l n="368">I guess I be'n frettin ’ all the time I ai n't be'n diggin ’ .</l>
       <l n="369">But anyhow I can n't dig to Chicago , can I ?</l>
       <l n="370">Thank you , Mis ’ Priest ,</l>
       <l n="371">I 'm better now . I only dropped in in passin ’ .</l>
       <l n="372">I 'll jest be steppin ’ along down to French 's .</l>
       <l n="373">No , I wo n't be seein ’ nobody in the mornin ’ ,</l>
       <l n="374">It 's a pretty early start .</l>
       <l n="375">Do n't you stand ther , Mis ’ Priest ,</l>

       <l n="583">Nothin ’ war n't right with me .</l>
       <l n="584">Never was .</l>
       <l n="585">Oh , Lord ! Why did I do it ?</l>
       <l n="586">Why ai n't it yesterday , and Ed here agin ?</l>
       <l n="587">Many 's the time I 've set up with him nights</l>
       <l n="588">When he had cramps , or rheumatizm , or somethin ’ .</l>
       <l n="589">I used ter nurse him same 's ef he was a baby .</l>
       <l n="590">I would n't hurt him , I love him !</l>
       <l n="591">Do n't you dare to say I killed him . ‘ Twar n't me !</l>
       <l n="592">Somethin ’ got aholt o ’ me . I could n't help it .</l>
       <l n="593">Oh , what shall I do ! What shall I do !</l>
       <l n="594">Yes , Sir .</l>
       <l n="595">No , Sir .</l>
       <l n="596">I beg your pardon , I — I —</l>
       <l n="597">Oh , I 'm a wicked woman !</l>
       <l n="598">An ’ I 'm desolate , desolate !</l>
       <l n="599">Why war n't I struck dead or paralyzed</l>
       <l n="600">Afore my hands done it .</l>
       <l n="601">Oh , my God , what shall I do !</l>
       <l n="602">No , Sir , ther ai n't no extenuatin ’ circumstances ,</l>
       <l n="603">An ’ I do n't want none .</l>
       <l n="604">I want a bolt o ’ lightnin ’</l>
       <l n="605">To strike me dead right now !</l>
       <l n="606">Oh , I 'll tell yer .</l>
       <l n="607">But it wo n't make no diff'rence .</l>
       <l n="608">Nothin ’ will .</l>
       <l n="609">Yes , I killed him .</l>
       <l n="610">Why do yer make me say it ?</l>
       <l n="611">It 's cruel ! Cruel !</l>
       <l n="612">I killed him because o ’ th ’ silence .</l>
       <l n="613">The long , long silence ,</l>
       <l n="614">That watched all around me ,</l>
       <l n="615">And he would n't break it .</l>
       <l n="616">I tried to make him ,</l>
       <l n="617">Time an ’ agin ,</l>
       <l n="618">But he was terrible taciturn , Ed was .</l>
       <l n="619">He never spoke ‘ cept when he had to ,</l>
       <l n="620">An ’ then he 'd only say “ yes ” and “ no ” .</l>
       <l n="621">You can n't even guess what that silence was .</l>
       <l n="622">I 'd hear it whisperin ’ in my ears ,</l>
       <l n="623">An ’ I got frightened , ‘ twas so thick ,</l>
       <l n="624">An ’ al'ays comin ’ back .</l>
       <l n="625">Ef Ed would ha ’ talked sometimes</l>
       <l n="626">It would ha ’ driven it away ;</l>
       <l n="627">But he never would .</l>
       <l n="628">He did n't hear it same as I did .</l>
       <l n="629">You see , Sir ,</l>
       <l n="630">Our farm was off'n the main road ,</l>
       <l n="631">And set away back under the mountain ;</l>
       <l n="632">And the village was seven mile off ,</l>
       <l n="633">Measurin ’ after you 'd got out o ’ our lane .</l>
       <l n="634">We did n't have no hired man ,</l>
       <l n="635">‘ Cept in hayin ’ time ;</l>
       <l n="636">An ’ Dane 's place ,</l>
       <l n="637">That was the nearest ,</l>
       <l n="638">Was clear way ‘ tother side the mountain .</l>
       <l n="639">They used Marley post-office</l>
       <l n="640">An ’ ours was Benton .</l>
       <l n="641">Ther was a cart-track took yer to Dane 's in Summer ,</l>
       <l n="642">An ’ it war n't above two mile that way ,</l>
       <l n="643">But it war n't never broke out Winters .</l>
       <l n="644">I used to dread the Winters .</l>
       <l n="645">Seem 's ef I could n't abear to see the golden-rod bloomin ’ ;</l>
       <l n="646">Winter 'd come so quick after that .</l>
       <l n="647">You do n't know what snow 's like when yer with it</l>
       <l n="648">Day in an ’ day out .</l>
       <l n="649">Ed would be out all day loggin ’ ,</l>
       <l n="650">An ’ I set at home and look at the snow</l>
       <l n="651">Layin ’ over everythin ’ ;</l>
       <l n="652">It ‘ ud dazzle me blind ,</l>
       <l n="653">Till it war n't white any more , but black as ink .</l>
       <l n="654">Then the quiet ‘ ud commence rushin ’ past my ears</l>
       <l n="655">Till I most went mad listenin ’ to it .</l>
       <l n="656">Many 's the time I 've dropped a pan on the floor</l>
       <l n="657">Jest to hear it clatter .</l>
       <l n="658">I was most frantic when dinner-time come</l>
       <l n="659">An ’ Ed was back from the woods .</l>
       <l n="660">I 'd ha ’ give my soul to hear him speak .</l>
       <l n="661">But he 'd never say a word till I asked him</l>
       <l n="662">Did he like the raised biscuits or whatever ,</l>
       <l n="663">An ’ then sometimes he 'd jest nod his answer .</l>
       <l n="664">Then he 'd go out agin ,</l>
       <l n="665">An ’ I 'd watch him from the kitchin winder .</l>
       <l n="666">It seemed the woods come marchin ’ out to meet him</l>
       <l n="667">An ’ the trees ‘ ud press round him an ’ hustle him .</l>
       <l n="668">I got so I was scared o ’ th ’ trees .</l>
       <l n="669">I thought they come nearer ,</l>
       <l n="670">Every day a little nearer ,</l>
       <l n="671">Closin ’ up round the house .</l>
       <l n="672">I never went in t ’ th ’ woods Winters ,</l>
       <l n="673">Though in Summer I liked ‘ em well enough .</l>
       <l n="674">It war n't so bad when my little boy was with us .</l>
       <l n="675">He used to go sleddin ’ and skatin ’ ,</l>
       <l n="676">An ’ every day his father fetched him to school in the pung</l>
       <l n="677">An ’ brought him back agin .</l>
       <l n="678">We scraped an ’ scraped fer Neddy ,</l>
       <l n="679">We wanted him to have a education .</l>
       <l n="680">We sent him to High School ,</l>
       <l n="681">An ’ then he went up to Boston to Technology .</l>
       <l n="682">He was a minin ’ engineer ,</l>
       <l n="683">An ’ doin ’ real well ,</l>
       <l n="684">A credit to his bringin ’ up .</l>
       <l n="685">But his very first position ther was an explosion in the mine .</l>
       <l n="686">And I 'm glad ! I 'm glad !</l>
       <l n="687">He ai n't here to see me now .</l>
       <l n="688">Neddy ! Neddy !</l>
       <l n="689">I 'm your mother still , Neddy .</l>
       <l n="690">Do n't turn from me like that .</l>
       <l n="691">I can n't abear it . I can n't ! I can n't !</l>
       <l n="692">What did you say ?</l>
       <l n="693">Oh , yes , Sir .</l>
       <l n="694">I 'm here .</l>
       <l n="695">I 'm very sorry ,</l>
       <l n="696">I do n't know what I 'm sayin ’ .</l>
       <l n="697">No , Sir ,</l>
       <l n="698">Not till after Neddy died .</l>
       <l n="699">‘ Twas the next Winter the silence come ,</l>
       <l n="700">I do n't remember noticin ’ it afore .</l>
       <l n="701">That was five year ago ,</l>
       <l n="702">An ’ it 's been gittin ’ worse an ’ worse .</l>
       <l n="703">I asked Ed to put in a telephone .</l>
       <l n="704">I thought ef I felt the whisperin ’ comin ’ on</l>
       <l n="705">I could ring up some o ’ th ’ folks .</l>
       <l n="706">But Ed would n't hear of it .</l>
       <l n="707">He said we 'd paid so much for Neddy</l>
       <l n="708">We could n't hardly git along as ‘ twas .</l>
       <l n="709">An ’ he never understood me wantin ’ to talk .</l>
       <l n="710">Well , this year was worse'n all the others ;</l>
       <l n="711">We had a terrible spell o ’ stormy weather ,</l>
       <l n="712">An ’ the snow lay so thick</l>
       <l n="713">You could n't see the fences even .</l>
       <l n="714">Out o ’ doors was as flat as the palm o ’ my hand ,</l>
       <l n="715">Ther war n't a hump or a holler</l>
       <l n="716">Fer as you could see .</l>
       <l n="717">It was so quiet</l>
       <l n="718">The snappin ’ o ’ the branches back in the wood-lot</l>
       <l n="719">Sounded like pistol shots .</l>
       <l n="720">Ed was out all day</l>
       <l n="721">Same as usual .</l>
       <l n="722">An ’ it seemed he talked less'n ever .</l>
       <l n="723">He did n't even say ‘ Good-mornin'’ , once or twice ,</l>
       <l n="724">An ’ jest nodded or shook his head when I asked him things .</l>
       <l n="725">On Monday he said he 'd got to go over to Benton</l>
       <l n="726">Fer some oats .</l>
       <l n="727">I 'd oughter ha ’ gone with him ,</l>
       <l n="728">But ‘ twas washin ’ day</l>
       <l n="729">An ’ I was afeared the fine weather 'd break ,</l>
       <l n="730">An ’ I could n't do my dryin ’ .</l>
       <l n="731">All my life I 'd done my work punctual ,</l>
       <l n="732">An ’ I could n't fix my conscience</l>
       <l n="733">To go junketin ’ on a washin ’ - day .</l>
       <l n="734">I can n't tell you what that day was to me .</l>
       <l n="735">It dragged an ’ dragged ,</l>
       <l n="736">Fer ther war n't no Ed ter break it in the middle</l>
       <l n="737">Fer dinner .</l>
       <l n="738">Every time I stopped stirrin ’ the water</l>
       <l n="739">I heerd the whisperin ’ all about me .</l>
       <l n="740">I stopped oftener'n I should</l>
       <l n="741">To see ef ‘ twas still ther ,</l>
       <l n="742">An ’ it al'ays was .</l>
       <l n="743">An ’ gittin ’ louder</l>
       <l n="744">It seemed ter me .</l>
       <l n="745">Once I threw up the winder to feel the wind .</l>
       <l n="746">That seemed most alive somehow .</l>
       <l n="747">But the woods looked so kind of menacin ’</l>
       <l n="748">I closed it quick</l>
       <l n="749">An ’ started to mangle 's hard 's I could ,</l>
       <l n="750">The squeakin ’ was comfortin ’ .</l>
       <l n="751">Well , Ed come home ‘ bout four .</l>
       <l n="752">I seen him down the road ,</l>
       <l n="753">An ’ I run out through the shed inter th ’ barn</l>
       <l n="754">To meet him quicker .</l>
       <l n="755">I hollered out , ‘ Hullo ! ’</l>
       <l n="756">But he did n't say nothin ’ ,</l>
       <l n="757">He jest drove right in</l>
       <l n="758">An ’ climbed out o ’ th ’ sleigh</l>
       <l n="759">An ’ commenced unharnessin ’ .</l>
       <l n="760">I asked him a heap o ’ questions ;</l>
       <l n="761">Who he 'd seed</l>
       <l n="762">An ’ what he 'd done .</l>
       <l n="763">Once in a while he 'd nod or shake ,</l>
       <l n="764">But most o ’ th ’ time he did n't do nothin ’ .</l>
       <l n="765">‘ Twas gittin ’ dark then ,</l>
       <l n="766">An ’ I was in a state ,</l>
       <l n="767">With the loneliness</l>
       <l n="768">An ’ Ed payin ’ no attention</l>
       <l n="769">Like somethin ’ war n't livin ’ .</l>
       <l n="770">All of a sudden it come ,</l>
       <l n="771">I do n't know what ,</l>
       <l n="772">But I jest could n't stand no more .</l>
       <l n="773">It did n't seem ‘ s though that was Ed ,</l>
       <l n="774">An ’ it did n't seem as though I was me .</l>
       <l n="775">I had to break a way out somehow ,</l>
       <l n="776">Somethin ’ was closin ’ in</l>
       <l n="777">An ’ I was stiflin ’ .</l>
       <l n="778">Ed 's loggin ’ axe was ther ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="3">It was a gusty night ,</l>
       <l n="4">With the wind booming , and swooping ,</l>
       <l n="5">Looping round corners ,</l>
       <l n="6">Sliding over the cobble-stones ,</l>
       <l n="7">Whipping and veering ,</l>
       <l n="8">And careering over the roofs</l>
       <l n="9">Like a thousand clattering horses .</l>
       <l n="10">Mr. Spruggins had been dining in the city ,</l>
       <l n="11">Mr. Spruggins was none too steady in his gait ,</l>
       <l n="12">And the wind played ball with Mr. Spruggins</l>
       <l n="13">And laughed as it whistled past him .</l>
       <l n="14">It rolled him along the street ,</l>
       <l n="15">With his little feet pit-a-patting on the flags of the sidewalk ,</l>
       <l n="16">And his muffler and his coat-tails blown straight out behind him .</l>
       <l n="17">It bumped him against area railings ,</l>
       <l n="18">And chuckled in his ear when he said “ Ouch ! ”</l>
       <l n="19">Sometimes it lifted him clear off his little patting feet</l>
       <l n="20">And bore him in triumph over three grey flagstones and a quarter .</l>
       <l n="21">The moon dodged in and out of clouds , winking .</l>
       <l n="22">It was all very unpleasant for Mr. Spruggins ,</l>
       <l n="23">And when the wind flung him hard against his own front door</l>
       <l n="24">It was a relief ,</l>
       <l n="25">Although the breath was quite knocked out of him .</l>
       <l n="26">The gas-lamp in front of the house flared up ,</l>
       <l n="27">And the keyhole was as big as a barn door ;</l>
       <l n="28">The gas-lamp flickered away to a sputtering blue star ,</l>
       <l n="29">And the keyhole went out with it .</l>
       <l n="30">Such a stabbing , and jabbing ,</l>
       <l n="31">And sticking , and picking ,</l>
       <l n="32">And poking , and pushing , and prying</l>
       <l n="33">With that key ;</l>
       <l n="34">And there is no denying that Mr. Spruggins rapped out an oath or two ,</l>
       <l n="35">Rub-a-dub-dubbing them out to a real snare-drum roll .</l>
       <l n="36">But the door opened at last ,</l>
       <l n="37">And Mr. Spruggins blew through it into his own hall</l>
       <l n="38">And slammed the door to so hard</l>
       <l n="39">That the knocker banged five times before it stopped .</l>
       <l n="40">Mr. Spruggins struck a light and lit a candle ,</l>
       <l n="41">And all the time the moon winked at him through the window .</l>
       <l n="42">“ Why could n't you find the keyhole , Spruggins ? ”</l>
       <l n="43">Taunted the wind .</l>
       <l n="44">“ I can find the keyhole . ”</l>
       <l n="45">And the wind , thin as a wire ,</l>
       <l n="46">Darted in and seized the candle flame</l>
       <l n="47">And knocked it over to one side</l>
       <l n="48">And pummelled it down — down — down —!</l>
       <l n="49">But Mr. Spruggins held the candle so close that it singed his chin ,</l>
       <l n="50">And ran and stumbled up the stairs in a surprisingly agile manner ,</l>
       <l n="51">For the wind through the keyhole kept saying , “ Spruggins ! Spruggins ! ”</l>
       <l n="52">behind him .</l>
       <l n="53">The fire in his bedroom burned brightly .</l>
       <l n="54">The room with its crimson bed and window curtains</l>
       <l n="55">Was as red and glowing as a carbuncle .</l>
       <l n="56">It was still and warm .</l>
       <l n="57">There was no wind here , for the windows were fastened ;</l>
       <l n="58">And no moon ,</l>
       <l n="59">For the curtains were drawn .</l>
       <l n="60">The candle flame stood up like a pointed pear</l>
       <l n="61">In a wide brass dish .</l>
       <l n="62">Mr. Spruggins sighed with content ;</l>
       <l n="63">He was safe at home .</l>
       <l n="64">The fire glowed — red and yellow roses</l>
       <l n="65">In the black basket of the grate —</l>
       <l n="66">And the bed with its crimson hangings</l>
       <l n="67">Seemed a great peony ,</l>
       <l n="68">Wide open and placid .</l>
       <l n="69">Mr. Spruggins slipped off his top-coat and his muffler .</l>
       <l n="70">He slipped off his bottle-green coat</l>
       <l n="71">And his flowered waistcoat .</l>
       <l n="72">He put on a flannel dressing-gown ,</l>
       <l n="73">And tied a peaked night-cap under his chin .</l>
       <l n="74">He wound his large gold watch</l>
       <l n="75">And placed it under his pillow .</l>
       <l n="76">Then he tiptoed over to the window and pulled back the curtain .</l>
       <l n="77">There was the moon dodging in and out of the clouds ;</l>
       <l n="78">But behind him was his quiet candle .</l>
       <l n="79">There was the wind whisking along the street .</l>
       <l n="80">The window rattled , but it was fastened .</l>
       <l n="81">Did the wind say , “ Spruggins ” ?</l>
       <l n="82">All Mr. Spruggins heard was “ S-s-s-s-s — ”</l>
       <l n="83">Dying away down the street .</l>
       <l n="84">He dropped the curtain and got into bed .</l>
       <l n="85">Martha had been in the last thing with the warming-pan ;</l>
       <l n="86">The bed was warm ,</l>
       <l n="87">And Mr. Spruggins sank into feathers ,</l>
       <l n="88">With the familiar ticking of his watch just under his head .</l>
       <l n="89">Mr. Spruggins dozed .</l>
       <l n="90">He had forgotten to put out the candle ,</l>
       <l n="91">But it did not make much difference as the fire was so bright ...</l>
       <l n="92">Too bright !</l>
       <l n="93">The red and yellow roses pricked his eyelids ,</l>
       <l n="94">They scorched him back to consciousness .</l>
       <l n="95">He tried to shift his position ;</l>
       <l n="96">He could not move .</l>
       <l n="97">Something weighed him down ,</l>
       <l n="98">He could not breathe .</l>
       <l n="99">He was gasping ,</l>
       <l n="100">Pinned down and suffocating .</l>
       <l n="101">He opened his eyes .</l>
       <l n="102">The curtains of the window were flung back ,</l>
       <l n="103">The fire and the candle were out ,</l>
       <l n="104">And the room was filled with green moonlight .</l>
       <l n="105">And pressed against the window-pane</l>
       <l n="106">Was a wide , round face ,</l>
       <l n="107">Winking — winking —</l>
       <l n="108">Solemnly dropping one eyelid after the other .</l>
       <l n="109">Tick — tock — went the watch under his pillow ,</l>
       <l n="110">Wink — wink — went the face at the window .</l>
       <l n="111">It was not the fire roses which had pricked him ,</l>
       <l n="112">It was the winking eyes .</l>
       <l n="113">Mr. Spruggins tried to bounce up ;</l>
       <l n="114">He could not , because —</l>
       <l n="115">His heart flapped up into his mouth</l>
       <l n="116">And fell back dead .</l>
       <l n="117">On his chest was a fat pink pig ,</l>
       <l n="118">On the pig a blackamoor</l>
       <l n="119">With a ten pound weight for a cap .</l>
       <l n="120">His mustachios kept curling up and down like angry snakes ,</l>
       <l n="121">And his eyes rolled round and round ,</l>
       <l n="122">With the pupils coming into sight , and disappearing ,</l>
       <l n="123">And appearing again on the other side .</l>
       <l n="124">The holsters at his saddle-bow were two port bottles ,</l>
       <l n="125">And a curved table-knife hung at his belt for a scimitar ,</l>
       <l n="126">While a fork and a keg of spirits were strapped to the saddle behind .</l>
       <l n="127">He dug his spurs into the pig ,</l>
       <l n="128">Which trampled and snorted ,</l>
       <l n="129">And stamped its cloven feet deeper into Mr. Spruggins .</l>
       <l n="130">Then the green light on the floor began to undulate .</l>
       <l n="131">It heaved and hollowed ,</l>
       <l n="132">It rose like a tide ,</l>
       <l n="133">Sea-green ,</l>
       <l n="134">Full of claws and scales</l>
       <l n="135">And wriggles .</l>
       <l n="136">The air above his bed began to move ;</l>
       <l n="137">It weighed over him</l>
       <l n="138">In a mass of draggled feathers .</l>
       <l n="139">Not one lifted to stir the air .</l>
       <l n="140">They drooped and dripped</l>
       <l n="141">With a smell of port wine and brandy ,</l>
       <l n="142">Closing down , slowly ,</l>
       <l n="143">Trickling drops on the bed-quilt .</l>
       <l n="144">Suddenly the window fell in with a great scatter of glass ,</l>
       <l n="145">And the moon burst into the room ,</l>
       <l n="146">Sizzling — “ S-s-s-s-s — Spruggins ! Spruggins ! ”</l>
       <l n="147">It rolled toward him ,</l>
       <l n="148">A green ball of flame ,</l>
       <l n="149">With two eyes in the center ,</l>
       <l n="150">A red eye and a yellow eye ,</l>
       <l n="151">Dropping their lids slowly ,</l>
       <l n="152">One after the other .</l>
       <l n="153">Mr. Spruggins tried to scream ,</l>
       <l n="154">But the blackamoor</l>
       <l n="155">Leapt off his pig</l>
       <l n="156">With a cry ,</l>
       <l n="157">Drew his scimitar ,</l>
       <l n="158">And plunged it into Mr. Spruggins 's mouth .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="159">Mr. Spruggins got up in the cold dawn</l>
       <l n="160">And remade the fire .</l>
       <l n="161">Then he crept back to bed</l>
       <l n="162">By the light which seeped in under the window curtains ,</l>
       <l n="163">And lay there , shivering ,</l>
       <l n="164">While the bells of St. George the Martyr chimed the quarter after seven .</l>

       <l n="165">The Paper Windmill</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The little boy pressed his face against the window-pane and looked out at the bright sunshiny morning . The cobble-stones of the square glistened like mica . In the trees , a breeze danced and pranced , and shook drops of sunlight like falling golden coins into the brown water of the canal . Down stream slowly drifted a long string of galliots piled with crimson cheeses . The little boy thought they looked as if they were roc 's eggs , blocks of big ruby eggs . He said , “ Oh ! ” with delight , and pressed against the window with all his might .</p>
     <p>The golden cock on the top of the ‘ Stadhuis ’ gleamed . His beak was open like a pair of scissors and a narrow piece of blue sky was wedged in it . “ Cock-a-doodle-do , ” cried the little boy . “ Ca n't you hear me through the window , Gold Cocky ? Cock-a-doodle-do ! You should crow when you see the eggs of your cousin , the great roc . ” But the golden cock stood stock still , with his fine tail blowing in the wind . He could not understand the little boy , for he said “ Cocorico ” when he said anything . But he was hung in the air to swing , not to sing . His eyes glittered to the bright West wind , and the crimson cheeses drifted away down the canal .</p>
     <p>It was very dull there in the big room . Outside in the square , the wind was playing tag with some fallen leaves . A man passed , with a dogcart beside him full of smart , new milkcans . They rattled out a gay tune : “ Tiddity-tum-ti-ti . Have some milk for your tea . Cream for your coffee to drink to-night , thick , and smooth , and sweet , and white , ” and the man 's sabots beat an accompaniment : “ Plop ! trop ! milk for your tea . Plop ! trop ! drink it to-night . ” It was very pleasant out there , but it was lonely here in the big room . The little boy gulped at a tear .</p>
     <p>It was queer how dull all his toys were . They were so still . Nothing was still in the square . If he took his eyes away a moment it had changed . The milkman had disappeared round the corner , there was only an old woman with a basket of green stuff on her head , picking her way over the shiny stones . But the wind pulled the leaves in the basket this way and that , and displayed them to beautiful advantage . The sun patted them condescendingly on their flat surfaces , and they seemed sprinkled with silver . The little boy sighed as he looked at his disordered toys on the floor . They were motionless , and their colours were dull . The dark wainscoting absorbed the sun . There was none left for toys .</p>
     <p>The square was quite empty now . Only the wind ran round and round it , spinning . Away over in the corner where a street opened into the square , the wind had stopped . Stopped running , that is , for it never stopped spinning . It whirred , and whirled , and gyrated , and turned . It burned like a great coloured sun . It hummed , and buzzed , and sparked , and darted . There were flashes of blue , and long smearing lines of saffron , and quick jabs of green . And over it all was a sheen like a myriad cut diamonds . Round and round it went , the huge wind-wheel , and the little boy 's head reeled with watching it . The whole square was filled with its rays , blazing and leaping round after one another , faster and faster . The little boy could not speak , he could only gaze , staring in amaze .</p>
     <p>The wind-wheel was coming down the square . Nearer and nearer it came , a great disk of spinning flame . It was opposite the window now , and the little boy could see it plainly , but it was something more than the wind which he saw . A man was carrying a huge fan-shaped frame on his shoulder , and stuck in it were many little painted paper windmills , each one scurrying round in the breeze . They were bright and beautiful , and the sight was one to please anybody , and how much more a little boy who had only stupid , motionless toys to enjoy .</p>
     <p>The little boy clapped his hands , and his eyes danced and whizzed , for the circling windmills made him dizzy . Closer and closer came the windmill man , and held up his big fan to the little boy in the window of the Ambassador 's house . Only a pane of glass between the boy and the windmills . They slid round before his eyes in rapidly revolving splendour . There were wheels and wheels of colours — big , little , thick , thin — all one clear , perfect spin . The windmill vendor dipped and raised them again , and the little boy 's face was glued to the window-pane . Oh ! What a glorious , wonderful plaything ! Rings and rings of windy colour always moving ! How had any one ever preferred those other toys which never stirred . “ Nursie , come quickly . Look ! I want a windmill . See ! It is never still . You will buy me one , wo n't you ? I want that silver one , with the big ring of blue . ”</p>
     <p>So a servant was sent to buy that one : silver , ringed with blue , and smartly it twirled about in the servant 's hands as he stood a moment to pay the vendor . Then he entered the house , and in another minute he was standing in the nursery door , with some crumpled paper on the end of a stick which he held out to the little boy . “ But I wanted a windmill which went round , ” cried the little boy . “ That is the one you asked for , Master Charles , ” Nursie was a bit impatient , she had mending to do . “ See , it is silver , and here is the blue . ” “ But it is only a blue streak , ” sobbed the little boy . “ I wanted a blue ring , and this silver does n't sparkle . ” “ Well , Master Charles , that is what you wanted , now run away and play with it , for I am very busy . ”</p>
     <p>The little boy hid his tears against the friendly window-pane . On the floor lay the motionless , crumpled bit of paper on the end of its stick . But far away across the square was the windmill vendor , with his big wheel of whirring splendour . It spun round in a blaze like a whirling rainbow , and the sun gleamed upon it , and the wind whipped it , until it seemed a maze of spattering diamonds . “ Cocorico ! ” crowed the golden cock on the top of the ‘ Stadhuis ’ . “ That is something worth crowing for . ” But the little boy did not hear him , he was sobbing over the crumpled bit of paper on the floor .</p>
     <p>The Red Lacquer Music-Stand</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">A music-stand of crimson lacquer , long since brought</l>
       <l n="2">In some fast clipper-ship from China , quaintly wrought</l>
       <l n="3">With bossed and carven flowers and fruits in blackening gold ,</l>
       <l n="4">The slender shaft all twined about and thickly scrolled</l>
       <l n="5">With vine leaves and young twisted tendrils , whirling , curling ,</l>
       <l n="6">Flinging their new shoots over the four wings , and swirling</l>
       <l n="7">Out on the three wide feet in golden lumps and streams ;</l>
       <l n="8">Petals and apples in high relief , and where the seams</l>
       <l n="9">Are worn with handling , through the polished crimson sheen ,</l>
       <l n="10">Long streaks of black , the under lacquer , shine out clean .</l>
       <l n="11">Four desks , adjustable , to suit the heights of players</l>
       <l n="12">Sitting to viols or standing up to sing , four layers</l>
       <l n="13">Of music to serve every instrument , are there ,</l>
       <l n="14">And on the apex a large flat-topped golden pear .</l>
       <l n="15">It burns in red and yellow , dusty , smouldering lights ,</l>
       <l n="16">When the sun flares the old barn-chamber with its flights</l>
       <l n="17">And skips upon the crystal knobs of dim sideboards ,</l>
       <l n="18">Legless and mouldy , and hops , glint to glint , on hoards</l>
       <l n="19">Of scythes , and spades , and dinner-horns , so the old tools</l>
       <l n="20">Are little candles throwing brightness round in pools .</l>
       <l n="21">With Oriental splendour , red and gold , the dust</l>
       <l n="22">Covering its flames like smoke and thinning as a gust</l>
       <l n="23">Of brighter sunshine makes the colours leap and range ,</l>
       <l n="24">The strange old music-stand seems to strike out and change ;</l>
       <l n="25">To stroke and tear the darkness with sharp golden claws ;</l>
       <l n="26">To dart a forked , vermilion tongue from open jaws ;</l>
       <l n="27">To puff out bitter smoke which chokes the sun ; and fade</l>
       <l n="28">Back to a still , faint outline obliterate in shade .</l>
       <l n="29">Creeping up the ladder into the loft , the Boy</l>
       <l n="30">Stands watching , very still , prickly and hot with joy .</l>
       <l n="31">He sees the dusty sun-mote slit by streaks of red ,</l>
       <l n="32">He sees it split and stream , and all about his head</l>
       <l n="33">Spikes and spears of gold are licking , pricking , flicking ,</l>
       <l n="34">Scratching against the walls and furniture , and nicking</l>
       <l n="35">The darkness into sparks , chipping away the gloom .</l>
       <l n="36">The Boy 's nose smarts with the pungence in the room .</l>
       <l n="37">The wind pushes an elm branch from before the door</l>
       <l n="38">And the sun widens out all along the floor ,</l>
       <l n="39">Filling the barn-chamber with white , straightforward light ,</l>
       <l n="40">So not one blurred outline can tease the mind to fright .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ O All ye Works of the Lord , Bless ye the Lord ; Praise Him , and Magnify Him for ever . O let the Earth Bless the Lord ; Yea , let it Praise Him , and Magnify Him for ever . O ye Mountains and Hills , Bless ye the Lord ; Praise Him , and Magnify Him for ever . O All ye Green Things upon the Earth , Bless ye the Lord ; Praise Him , and Magnify Him for ever . ”</p>

       <l n="4">Like shoots of all the Green Things , the God of this bright World</l>

       <l n="6">The Boy turns round about , seeking with careful gaze</l>
       <l n="7">An altar meet and worthy , but each table and chair</l>
       <l n="8">Has some defect , each piece is needing some repair</l>
       <l n="9">To perfect it ; the chairs have broken legs and backs ,</l>

     <p>The sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white . It cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel , and cracks it to bright light .</p>
     <p>Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance , dance , and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling ; a stir of my finger sets them whirring , reeling . I move a foot , and the planes of light in the water jar . I lie back and laugh , and let the green-white water , the sun-flawed beryl water , flow over me . The day is almost too bright to bear , the green water covers me from the too bright day . I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots .</p>
     <p>The sky is blue and high . A crow flaps by the window , and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air .</p>
     <p>Breakfast Table</p>
     <p>In the fresh-washed sunlight , the breakfast table is decked and white . It offers itself in flat surrender , tendering tastes , and smells , and colours , and metals , and grains , and the white cloth falls over its side , draped and wide . Wheels of white glitter in the silver coffee-pot , hot and spinning like catherine-wheels , they whirl , and twirl — and my eyes begin to smart , the little white , dazzling wheels prick them like darts . Placid and peaceful , the rolls of bread spread themselves in the sun to bask . A stack of butter-pats , pyramidal , shout orange through the white , scream , flutter , call : “ Yellow ! Yellow ! Yellow ! ” Coffee steam rises in a stream , clouds the silver tea-service with mist , and twists up into the sunlight , revolved , involuted , suspiring higher and higher , fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky . A crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam . The day is new and fair with good smells in the air .</p>
     <p>Walk</p>
     <p>Over the street the white clouds meet , and sheer away without touching .</p>
     <p>On the sidewalks , boys are playing marbles . Glass marbles , with amber and blue hearts , roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise . The boys strike them with black and red striped agates . The glass marbles spit crimson when they are hit , and slip into the gutters under rushing brown water . I smell tulips and narcissus in the air , but there are no flowers anywhere , only white dust whipping up the street , and a girl with a gay Spring hat and blowing skirts . The dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat , high-heeled patent leather shoes . Tap , tap , the little heels pat the pavement , and the wind rustles among the flowers on her hat .</p>
     <p>A water-cart crawls slowly on the other side of the way . It is green and gay with new paint , and rumbles contentedly , sprinkling clear water over the white dust . Clear zigzagging water , which smells of tulips and narcissus .</p>
     <p>The thickening branches make a pink ‘ grisaille ’ against the blue sky .</p>
     <p>Whoop ! The clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time . Whoop ! And a man 's hat careers down the street in front of the white dust , leaps into the branches of a tree , veers away and trundles ahead of the wind , jarring the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green .</p>
     <p>A motor-car cuts a swathe through the bright air , sharp-beaked , irresistible , shouting to the wind to make way . A glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it , and settles down . The sky is quiet and high , and the morning is fair with fresh-washed air .</p>
     <p>Midday and Afternoon</p>
     <p>Swirl of crowded streets . Shock and recoil of traffic . The stock-still brick facade of an old church , against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw . Flare of sunshine down side-streets . Eddies of light in the windows of chemists ’ shops , with their blue , gold , purple jars , darting colours far into the crowd . Loud bangs and tremors , murmurings out of high windows , whirring of machine belts , blurring of horses and motors . A quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car , and the jar of a church-bell knocking against the metal blue of the sky . I am a piece of the town , a bit of blown dust , thrust along with the crowd . Proud to feel the pavement under me , reeling with feet . Feet tripping , skipping , lagging , dragging , plodding doggedly , or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps . A boy is selling papers , I smell them clean and new from the press . They are fresh like the air , and pungent as tulips and narcissus .</p>
     <p>The blue sky pales to lemon , and great tongues of gold blind the shop-windows , putting out their contents in a flood of flame .</p>
     <p>Night and Sleep</p>
     <p>The day takes her ease in slippered yellow . Electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts , following each other . They grow , and grow , and blow into patterns of fire-flowers as the sky fades . Trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night . Twinkle , jab , snap , that means a new play ; and over the way : plop , drop , quiver , is the sidelong sliver of a watchmaker 's sign with its length on another street . A gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building , but the sky is high and has her own stars , why should she heed ours ?</p>
     <p>I leave the city with speed . Wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness . The breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and clean , it has come but recently from the high sky . There are no flowers in bloom yet , but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus .</p>
     <p>My room is tranquil and friendly . Out of the window I can see the distant city , a band of twinkling gems , little flower-heads with no stems . I cannot see the beer-glass , nor the letters of the restaurants and shops I passed , now the signs blur and all together make the city , glowing on a night of fine weather , like a garden stirring and blowing for the Spring .</p>
     <p>The night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air .</p>
     <p>Wrap me close , sheets of lavender . Pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears . The breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days , and cobbled streets , and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways . Pale blue lavender , you are the colour of the sky when it is fresh-washed and fair ... I smell the stars ... they are like tulips and narcissus ... I smell them in the air .</p>

     <p>Behind the polished glass , the slippers hang in long threads of red , festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood , flooding the eyes of passers-by with dripping colour , jamming their crimson reflections against the windows of cabs and tram-cars , screaming their claret and salmon into the teeth of the sleet , plopping their little round maroon lights upon the tops of umbrellas .</p>
     <p>The row of white , sparkling shop fronts is gashed and bleeding , it bleeds red slippers . They spout under the electric light , fluid and fluctuating , a hot rain — and freeze again to red slippers , myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window .</p>
     <p>They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of crimson lacquer ; they swing up over curved heels like whirling tanagers sucked in a wind-pocket ; they flatten out , heelless , like July ponds , flared and burnished by red rockets .</p>
     <p>Snap , snap , they are cracker-sparks of scarlet in the white , monotonous block of shops .</p>
     <p>They plunge the clangour of billions of vermilion trumpets into the crowd outside , and echo in faint rose over the pavement .</p>
     <p>People hurry by , for these are only shoes , and in a window , farther down , is a big lotus bud of cardboard whose petals open every few minutes and reveal a wax doll , with staring bead eyes and flaxen hair , lolling awkwardly in its flower chair .</p>
     <p>One has often seen shoes , but whoever saw a cardboard lotus bud before ?</p>
     <p>The flaws of grey , windy sleet beat on the shop-window where there are only red slippers .</p>
