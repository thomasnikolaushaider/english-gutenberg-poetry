    <head>DIVERSIONS OF THE RE-ECHO CLUB</head>
    <head>A recent discovery has brought to light the long-hidden papers of the Re-Echo Club . This is a great find , and all lovers of masterpieces of the world 's best literature will rejoice with us that we are enabled to publish herewith a few of these gems of great minds . Little is known of the locale or clientèle of this club , but it was doubtless a successor of the famous Echo Club of Boston memory , for , like that erudite body , it takes pleasure in trying to better what is done . On the occasion of the meeting of which the following gems of poesy are the result , the several members of the club engaged to write up the well-known tradition of the Purple Cow in more elaborate form than the quatrain made famous by Mr. Gelett Burgess :</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I never saw a Purple Cow ,</l>
     <l n="2">I never hope to see one ;</l>
     <l n="3">But I can tell you , anyhow ,</l>
     <l n="4">I 'd rather see than be one . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The first attempt here cited is the production of Mr. John Milton :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Hence , vain , deluding cows .</l>
     <l n="7">The herd of folly , without color bright ,</l>
     <l n="8">How little you delight ,</l>
     <l n="9">Or fill the Poet 's mind , or songs arouse !</l>
     <l n="10">But , hail ! thou goddess gay of feature !</l>
     <l n="11">Hail ! divinest purple creature !</l>
     <l n="12">Oh , Cow , thy visage is too bright</l>
     <l n="13">To hit the sense of human sight .</l>
     <l n="14">And though I 'd like , just once , to see thee ,</l>
     <l n="15">I never , never , never 'd be thee !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MR. P. BYSSHE SHELLEY :</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Hail to thee , blithe spirit !</l>
     <l n="2">Cow thou never wert ;</l>
     <l n="3">But in life to cheer it</l>
     <l n="4">Playest thy full part</l>
     <l n="5">In purple lines of unpremeditated art .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">The pale purple color</l>
     <l n="7">Melts around thy sight</l>
     <l n="8">Like a star , but duller ,</l>
     <l n="9">In the broad daylight .</l>
     <l n="10">I 'd see thee , but I would not be thee if I might .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">We look before and after</l>
     <l n="12">At cattle as they browse ;</l>
     <l n="13">Our most hearty laughter</l>
     <l n="14">Something sad must rouse .</l>
     <l n="15">Our sweetest songs are those that tell of Purple Cows .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MR. W. WORDSWORTH :</head>
     <l n="1">She dwelt among the untrodden ways</l>
     <l n="2">Beside the springs of Dee ;</l>
     <l n="3">A Cow whom there were few to praise</l>
     <l n="4">And very few to see .</l>
     <l n="5">A violet by a mossy stone</l>
     <l n="6">Greeting the smiling East</l>
     <l n="7">Is not so purple , I must own ,</l>
     <l n="8">As that erratic beast .</l>
     <l n="9">She lived unknown , that Cow , and so</l>
     <l n="10">I never chanced to see ;</l>
     <l n="11">But if I had to be one , oh ,</l>
     <l n="12">The difference to me !</l>

     <l n="1">The curfew tolls the knell of parting day ,</l>

     <l n="4">But , ah , a Purple Cow I did not see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Full many a cow of purplest ray serene</l>
     <l n="6">Is haply grazing where I may not see ;</l>

     <l n="8">But neither of these creatures would I be .</l>

    <head>MR. J. W. RILEY :</head>
     <l n="1">There , little Cow , do n't cry !</l>
     <l n="2">You are brindle and brown , I know .</l>
     <l n="3">And with wild , glad hues</l>
     <l n="4">Of reds and blues ,</l>
     <l n="5">You never will gleam and glow .</l>
     <l n="6">But though not pleasing to the eye ,</l>

     <l n="1">Ask me no more . A cow I fain would see</l>

     <l n="3">Of purple tint , like royal velvet cape —</l>
     <l n="4">But such a creature I would never be —</l>
     <l n="5">Ask me no more .</l>

   <p>Only in dim , drowsy depths of a dream do I dare to delight in deliciously dreaming Cows there may be of a passionate purple ,— cows of a violent violet-hue ; Ne'er have I seen such a sight , I am certain it is but a demi - delirious dreaming — Ne'er may I happily harbor a hesitant hope in my heart that my dream may come true . Sad is my soul , and my senses are sobbing , so strong is my strenuous spirit to see one . Dolefully , drearily doomed to despair as warily , wearily watching I wait ; Thoughts thickly thronging are thrilling and throbbing ; to see is a glorious gain — but to be one ! That were a darker and direfuller destiny , that were a fearfuller , frightfuller fate .</p>
   <p>At the second meeting of the Re-Echo Club , some of whose proceedings have already been chronicled in these pages , the question arose whether the poet was at his best who gave to the world the classic poem about The Little Girl :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ There was a little girl</l>
     <l n="2">And she had a little curl</l>
     <l n="3">Right in the middle of her forehead .</l>
     <l n="4">And when she was good ,</l>
     <l n="5">She was very , very good ,</l>
     <l n="6">And when she was bad she was horrid ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Some members held that poets had at times risen to sublimer poetic flights than this , while others contended that the clear-cut decision of thought it expressed placed the poem above more elaborate works .</p>
   <p>When those who criticised it were invited themselves to treat the same theme in more worthy fashion , they willingly enough agreed , and the results here subjoined were spread upon the minutes of the club .</p>

   <p>At the next meeting of the Re-Echo Club there was achieved a vindication of the limerick . “ It has been said , ” remarked the President of the Re-Echo Club , “ by ignorant and undiscerning would-be critics that the Limerick is not among the classic and best forms of poetry , and , indeed , some have gone so far as to say that it is not poetry at all .</p>
   <p>“ A brief consideration of its claims to preëminence among recognized forms of verse will soon convince any intelligent reader of its superlative worth and beauty .</p>
   <p>“ As a proof of this , let us consider the following Limerick , which in the opinion of connoisseurs is the best one ever written :</p>

   <p>She luminously wavered , and I tentatively inferred that she would soon perfectly reconsider her not altogether unobvious course . Furiously , tho ’ with a tender , ebbing similitude , across her mental consciousness stole a reculmination of all the truths she had ever known concerning , or even remotely relating to , the not easily fathomed qualities of paste and ink . So she stood , focused in an intensity of soul-quivers , and I , all unrelenting , waited , though of a dim uncertainty whether , after all , it might not be only a dubitant problem .</p>

     <l n="18">Perhaps one of the most enjoyable occasions was the night when the</l>
     <l n="19">members of the Re-Echo Club discussed the merits of the classic poem :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="20">Peter , Peter , Pumpkin Eater ,</l>
     <l n="21">Had a wife and could n't keep her ;</l>
     <l n="22">Put her in a pumpkin shell ,</l>
     <l n="23">And there he kept her very well .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In many ways this historic narrative called forth admiration . One must admit Peter 's great strength of character , his power of quick decision , and immediate achievement . Some held that his inability to retain the lady 's affection in the first place argued a defect in his nature ; but remembering the lady 's youth and beauty ( implied by the spirit of the whole poem ) , they could only reiterate their appreciation of the way he conquered circumstances , and proved himself master of his fate , and captain of his soul ! Truly , the Pumpkin-Eaters must have been a forceful race , able to defend their rights and rule their people .</p>
   <p>The Poets at their symposium unanimously felt that the style of the poem , though hardly to be called crude , was a little bare , and they took up with pleasure the somewhat arduous task of rewriting it .</p>
   <p>Mr. Ed Poe opined that there was lack of atmosphere , and that the facts of the narrative called for a more impressive setting . He therefore offered :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The skies , they were ashen and sober ,</l>
     <l n="2">The lady was shivering with fear ;</l>
     <l n="3">Her shoulders were shud'ring with fear ,</l>
     <l n="4">On a dark night in dismal October ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of his most Matrimonial Year .</l>
     <l n="6">It was hard by the cornfield of Auber ,</l>
     <l n="7">In the musty Mud Meadows of Weir ,</l>
     <l n="8">Down by the dank frog-pond of Auber ,</l>
     <l n="9">In the ghoul-haunted cornfield of Weir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Now , his wife had a temper Satanic ,</l>
     <l n="11">And when Peter roamed here with his Soul ,</l>
     <l n="12">Through the corn with his conjugal Soul ,</l>
     <l n="13">He spied a huge pumpkin Titanic ,</l>
     <l n="14">And he popped her right in through a hole .</l>
     <l n="15">Then solemnly sealed up the hole .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">And thus Peter Peter has kept her</l>
     <l n="17">Immured in Mausoleum gloom ,</l>
     <l n="18">A moist , humid , damp sort of gloom .</l>
     <l n="19">And , though there 's no doubt he bewept her ,</l>
     <l n="20">She is still in her yellow-hued tomb ,</l>
     <l n="21">Her unhallowed , Hallowe'en tomb</l>
     <l n="22">And ever since Peter side-stepped her ,</l>
     <l n="23">He calls her his lost Lulalume ,</l>
     <l n="24">His Pumpkin-entombed Lulalume .</l>

     <l n="25">This was received with acclaim , but many objected to the mortuary</l>
     <l n="26">theory .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Mrs. Robert Browning was sure that Peter 's love for his wife , though perhaps that of a primitive man , was of the true Portuguese stamp , and with this view composed the following pleasing Sonnet :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How do I keep thee ? Let me count the ways .</l>
     <l n="2">I bar up every breadth and depth and height</l>
     <l n="3">My hands can reach , while feeling out of sight</l>
     <l n="4">For bolts that stick and hasps that will not raise .</l>
     <l n="5">I keep thee from the public 's idle gaze ,</l>
     <l n="6">I keep thee in , by sun or candle light .</l>
     <l n="7">I keep thee , rude , as women strive for Right .</l>
     <l n="8">I keep thee boldly , as they seek for praise ,</l>
     <l n="9">I keep thee with more effort than I 'd use</l>
     <l n="10">To keep a dry-goods shop or big hotel .</l>
     <l n="11">I keep thee with a power I seemed to lose</l>
     <l n="12">With that last cook . I 'll keep thee down the well ,</l>
     <l n="13">Or up the chimney-place ! Or if I choose ,</l>
     <l n="14">I shall but keep thee in a Pumpkin shell .</l>

     <l n="3">The old exchange of trinkets , gauds and kickshaws ,</l>

     <l n="13">Of foolish books and little silver traps ,</l>

   <p>The Re-Echo Club met in their pleasant rooms at No . 4 , Poetic Mews . Spring had passed , so their fancy was lightly turning to other matters than Love , and it chanced to turn lightly to the Cubist Movement in Art .</p>
   <p>“ Of course , ” mused the President , rolling his eyes in an especially fine frenzy , “ this movement will strike the poets next . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha , ” said Dan Rossetti , refraining for a moment from the refrain he was building , “ we must be ready for it . ”</p>
   <p>“ We must advance to meet it , ” said Teddy Poe , who was ever of an adventurous nature . “ What 's it all about ? ”</p>
   <p>“ The principles are simple , ” observed Rob Browning , glancing from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; “ in fact , it 's much like my own work always has been . I was born cubic . You see , you just symbolize the liquefaction of the essence of an idea into its emotional constituents , and there you are ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Dead easy ! ” declared Lally Tennyson , who went out poeting by the day , and knew how to do any kind . “ What 's the subject ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That 's just the point , ” said the President ; “ preeminently and exclusively it 's subjective , and you must keep it so . On no account allow an object of any kind to creep in . Now , here 's one of the Cubist pictures . They call it ‘ A Nude Descending the Staircase . ’ They pick names at random out of a hat , I believe . Take this , you fellows , and throw it into poetry . ”</p>
   <p>“ Any rules or conditions ? ” asked Billy Wordsworth .</p>
   <p>“ Absolutely none . It 's the Ruleless School . ”</p>
   <p>Then the Poets opened the aspiration valves , ignited the divine spark plugs , and whiz ! went their motor-meters in a whirring , buzzing melody .</p>
   <p>Soon their Cubist emotions were splashed upon paper , and the Poets read with justifiable pride these symbolic results .</p>
   <p>Ally Swinburne tossed off this poetic gem without a bit of trouble .</p>
