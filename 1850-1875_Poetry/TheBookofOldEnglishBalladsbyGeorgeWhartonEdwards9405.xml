    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="1">Goethe , who saw so many things with such clearness of vision , brought out the charm of the popular ballad for readers of a later day in his remark that the value of these songs of the people is to be found in the fact that their motives are drawn directly from nature ; and he added , that in the art of saying things compactly , uneducated men have greater skill than those who are educated . It is certainly true that no kind of verse is so completely out of the atmosphere of modern writing as the popular ballad . No other form of verse has , therefore , in so great a degree , the charm of freshness . In material , treatment , and spirit , these bat lads are set in sharp contrast with the poetry of the hour . They deal with historical events or incidents , with local traditions , with personal adventure or achievement . They are , almost without exception , entirely objective . Contemporary poetry is , on the other hand , very largely subjective ; and even when it deals with events or incidents it invests them to such a degree with personal emotion and imagination , it so modifies and colours them with temperamental effects , that the resulting poem is much more a study of subjective conditions than a picture or drama of objective realities . This projection of the inward upon the outward world , in such a degree that the dividing line between the two is lost , is strikingly illustrated in Maeterlinck 's plays . Nothing could be in sharper contrast , for instance , than the famous ballad of “ The Hunting of the Cheviot ” and Maeterlinck 's “ Princess Maleine . ” There is no atmosphere , in a strict use of the word , in the spirited and compact account of the famous contention between the Percies and the Douglases , of which Sir Philip Sidney said “ that I found not my heart moved more than with a Trumpet . ” It is a breathless , rushing narrative of a swift succession of events , told with the most straight-forward simplicity . In the “ Princess Maleine , ” on the other hand , the narrative is so charged with subjective feeling , the world in which the action takes place is so deeply tinged with lights that never rested on any actual landscape , that all sense of reality is lost . The play depends for its effect mainly upon atmosphere . Certain very definite impressions are produced with singular power , but there is no clear , clean stamping of occurrences on the mind . The imagination is skilfully awakened and made to do the work of observation .</p>
    <p n="2">The note of the popular ballad is its objectivity ; it not only takes us out of doors , but it also takes us out of the individual consciousness . The manner is entirely subordinated to the matter ; the poet , if there was a poet in the case , obliterates himself . What we get is a definite report of events which have taken place , not a study of a man 's mind nor an account of a man 's feelings . The true balladist is never introspective ; he is concerned not with himself but with his story . There is no self-disclosure in his song . To the mood of Senancour and Amiel he was a stranger . Neither he nor the men to whom he recited or sang would have understood that mood . They were primarily and unreflectively absorbed in the world outside of themselves . They saw far more than they meditated ; they recorded far more than they moralized . The popular ballads are , as a rule , entirely free from didacticism in any form ; that is one of the main sources of their unfailing charm . They show not only a childlike curiosity about the doings of the day and the things that befall men , but a childlike indifference to moral inference and justification . The bloodier the fray the better for ballad purposes ; no one feels the necessity of apology either for ruthless aggression or for useless blood-letting ; the scene is reported as it was presented to the eye of the spectator , not to his moralizing faculty . He is expected to see and to sing , not to scrutinize and meditate . In those rare cases in which a moral inference is drawn , it is always so obvious and elementary that it gives the impression of having been fastened on at the end of the song , in deference to ecclesiastical rather than popular feeling .</p>
    <p n="3">The social and intellectual conditions which fostered self-unconsciousness ,— interest in things , incidents , and adventures rather than in moods and inward experiences ,— and the unmoral or non moralizing attitude towards events , fostered also that delightful naivete which contributes greatly to the charm of many of the best ballads ; a naivete which often heightens the pathos , and , at times , softens it with touches of apparently unconscious humour ; the naivete of the child which has in it something of the freshness of a wildflower , and yet has also a wonderful instinct for making the heart of the matter plain . This quality has almost entirely disappeared from contemporary verse among cultivated races ; one must go to the peasants of remote parts of the Continent to discover even a trace of its presence . It has a real , but short-lived charm , like the freshness which shines on meadow and garden in the brief dawn which hastens on to day .</p>
    <p n="4">This frank , direct play of thought and feeling on an incident , or series of incidents , compensates for the absence of a more perfect art in the ballads ; using the word “ art ” in its true sense as including complete , adequate , and beautiful handling of subject-matter , and masterly working out of its possibilities . These popular songs , so dear to the hearts of the generations on whose lips they were fashioned , and to all who care for the fresh note , the direct word , the unrestrained emotion , rarely touch the highest points of poetic achievement . Their charm lies , not in their perfection of form , but in their spontaneity , sincerity , and graphic power . They are not rivers of song , wide , deep , and swift ; they are rather cool , clear springs among the hills . In the reactions against sophisticated poetry which set in from lime to time , the popular ballad — the true folk-song — has often been exalted at the expense of other forms of verse . It is idle to attempt to arrange the various forms of poetry in an order of absolute values ; it is enough that each has its own quality , and , therefore , its own value . The drama , the epic , the ballad , the lyric , each strikes its note in the complete expression of human emotion and experience . Each belongs to a particular stage of development , and each has the authority and the enduring charm which attach to every authentic utterance of the spirit of man under the conditions of life .</p>
    <p n="5">In this wide range of human expression the ballad follows the epic as a kind of aftermath ; a second and scattered harvest , springing without regularity or nurture out of a rich and unexhausted soil . The epic fastens upon some event of such commanding importance that it marks a main current of history ; some story , historic , or mythologic ; some incident susceptible of extended narrative treatment . It is always , in its popular form , a matter of growth it is direct , simple , free from didacticism ; representing , as Aristotle says , “ a single action , entire and complete . ” It subordinates character to action ; it delights in episode and dialogue ; it is content to tell the story as a story , and leave the moralization to hearers or readers . The popular ballad is so closely related to the popular epic that it may be said to reproduce its qualities and characteristics within a narrower compass , and on a smaller scale . It also is a piece of the memory of the people , or a creation of the imagination of the people ; but the tradition or fact which it preserves is of local , rather than national importance . It is indifferent to nice distinctions and delicate gradations or shadings ; its power springs from its directness , vigour , and simplicity . It is often entirely occupied with the narration or description of a single episode ; it has no room for dialogue , but it often secures the effect of the dialogue by its unconventional freedom of phrase , and sometimes by the introduction of brief and compact charge and denial , question and reply . Sometimes the incidents upon which the ballad makers fastened , have a unity or connection with each other which hints at a complete story . The ballads which deal with Robin Hood are so numerous and so closely related that they constantly suggest , not only the possibility , but the probability of epic treatment . It is surprising that the richness of the material , and its notable illustrative quality , did not inspire some earlier Chaucer to combine the incidents in a sustained narrative . But the epic poet did not appear , and the most representative of English popular heroes remains the central figure in a series of detached episodes and adventures , preserved in a long line of disconnected ballads .</p>
    <p n="6">This apparent arrest , in the ballad stage , of a story which seemed destined to become an epic , naturally suggests the vexed question of the author ship of the popular ballads . They are in a very real sense the songs of the people ; they make no claim to individual authorship ; on the contrary , the inference of what may be called community authorship is , in many instances , irresistible . They are the product of a social condition which , so to speak , holds song of this kind in solution ; of an age in which improvisation , singing , and dancing are the most natural and familiar forms of expression . They deal almost without exception with matters which belong to the community memory or imagination ; they constantly reappear with variations so noticeable as to indicate free and common handling of themes of wide local interest . All this is true of the popular ballad ; but all this does not decisively settle the question of authorship . What share did the community have in the making of these songs , and what share fell to individual singers ?</p>
    <p n="7">Herder , whose conception of the origin and function of literature was so vitalizing in the general aridity of thinking about the middle of the last century , and who did even more for ballad verse in Germany than Bishop Percy did in England , laid emphasis almost exclusively on community authorship . His profound instinct for reality in all forms of art , his deep feeling for life , and the immense importance he attached to spontaneity and unconsciousness in the truest productivity made community authorship not only attractive but inevitable to him . In his pronounced reaction against the superficial ideas of literature so widely held in the Germany of his time , he espoused the conception of community authorship as the only possible explanation of the epics , ballads , and other folk-songs . In nature and popular life , or universal experience , he found the rich sources of the poetry whose charm he felt so deeply , and whose power and beauty he did so much to reveal to his contemporaries . Genius and nature are magical words with him , because they suggested such depths of being under all forms of expression ; such unity of the whole being of a race in its thought , its emotion , and its action ; such entire unconsciousness of self or of formulated aim , and such spontaneity of spirit and speech . The language of those times , when words had not yet been divided into nobles , middle-class , and plebeians , was , he said , the richest for poetical purposes . “ Our tongue , compared with the idiom of the savage , seems adapted rather for reflection than for the senses or imagination . The rhythm of popular verse is so delicate , so rapid , so precise , that it is no easy matter to defect it with our eyes ; but do not imagine it to have been equally difficult for those living populations who listened to , instead of reading it ; who were accustomed to the sound of it from their infancy ; who themselves sang it , and whose ear had been formed by its cadence . ” This conception of poetry as arising in the hearts of the people and taking form on their lips is still more definitely and strikingly expressed in two sentences , which let us into , the heart of Herder 's philosophy of poetry : “ Poetry in those happy days lived in the ears of the people , on the lips and in the harps of living bards ; it sang of history , of the events of the day , of mysteries , miracles , and signs . It was the flower of a nation 's character , language , and country ; of its occupations , its prejudices , its passions , its aspirations , and its soul . ” In these words , at once comprehensive and vague , after the manner of Herder , we find ourselves face to face with that conception not only of popular song in all its forms , but with literature as a whole , which has revolutionized literary study in this century , and revitalized it as well . For Herder was a man of prophetic instinct ; he sometimes felt more clearly than he saw ; he divined where he could not reach results by analysis . He was often vague , fragmentary , and inconclusive , like all men of his type ; but he had a genius for getting at the heart of things . His statements often need qualification , but he is almost always on the tight track . When he says that the great traditions , in which both the memory and the imagination of a race were engaged , and which were still living in the mouths of the people , “ of themselves took on poetic form , ” he is using language which is too general to convey a definite impression of method , but he is probably suggesting the deepest truth with regard to these popular stories . They actually were of community origin ; they actually were common property ; they were given a great variety of forms by a great number of persons ; the forms which have come down to us are very likely the survivors of a kind of in formal competition , which went on for years at the fireside and at the festivals of a whole country side .</p>
    <p n="8">Barger , whose “ Lenore ” is one of the most widely known of modern ballads , held the same view of the origin of popular song , and was even more definite in his confession of faith than Herder . He declared in the most uncompromising terms that all real poetry must have a popular origin ; “ can be and must be of the people , for that is the seal of its perfection . ” And he comments on the delight with which he has listened , in village street and home , to unwritten songs ; the poetry which finds its way in quiet rivulets to the remotest peasant home . In like manner , Helene Vacaresco overheard the songs of the Roumanian people ; hiding in the maize to catch the reaping songs ; listening at spinning parties , at festivals , at death-beds , at taverns ; taking the songs down from the lips of peasant women , fortune-tellers , gypsies , and all manner of humble folk who were the custodians of this vagrant community verse . We have passed so entirely out of the song-making period , and literature has become to us so exclusively the work of a professional class , that we find it difficult to imagine the intellectual and social conditions which fostered improvisation on a great scale , and trained the ear of great populations to the music of spoken poetry . It is almost impossible for us to disassociate literature from writing . There is still , however , a considerable volume of unwritten literature in the world in the form of stories , songs , proverbs , and pithy phrases ; a literature handed down in large part from earlier times , but still receiving additions from contemporary men and women .</p>
    <p n="9">This unwritten literature is to be found , it is hardly necessary to say , almost exclusively among country people remote from towns , and whose mental attitude and community feeling reproduce , in a way , the conditions under which the English and Scotch ballads were originally composed . The Roumanian peasants sing their songs upon every occasion of domestic or local interest ; and sowing and harvesting , birth , christening , marriage , the burial , these notable events in the life of the country side are all celebrated by unknown poets ; or , rather , by improvisers who give definite form to sentiments , phrases , and words which are on many lips . The Russian peasant tells his stories as they were told to him ; those heroic epics whose life is believed , in some cases , to date back at least a thousand years . These great popular stories form a kind of sacred inheritance bequeathed by one generation to another as a possession of the memory , and are almost entirely unrelated to the written literature of the country . Miss Hapgood tells a very interesting story of a government official , stationed on the western shore of Lake Onega , who became so absorbed in the search for this literature of the people that he followed singers and reciters from place to place , eager to learn from their lips the most widely known of these folk tales . On such an expedition of discovery he found himself , one stormy night , on an island in the lake . The hut of refuge was already full of stormbound peasants when he entered . Having made himself some tea , and spread his blanket in a vacant place , he fell asleep . He was presently awakened by a murmur of recurring sounds . Sitting up , he found the group of peasants hanging on the words of an old man , of kindly face , expressive eyes , and melodious voice , from whose lips flowed a marvellous song ; grave and gay by turns , monotonous and passionate in succession ; but wonderfully fresh , picturesque , and fascinating . The listener soon became aware that he was hearing , for the first time , the famous story of “ Sadko , the Merchant of Novgorod . ” It was like being present at the birth of a piece of literature !</p>
    <p n="10">The fact that unwritten songs and stories still exist in great numbers among remote country-folk of our own time , and that additions are still made to them , help us to understand the probable origin of our own popular ballads , and what community authorship may really mean . To put ourselves , even in thought , in touch with the ballad-making period in English and Scotch history , we must dismiss from our minds all modern ideas of authorship ; all notions of individual origination and ownership of any form of words . Professor ten Brink tells us that in the ballad-making age there was no production ; there was only reproduction . There was a stock of traditions , memories , experiences , held in common by large populations , in constant use on the lips of numberless persons ; told and retold in many forms , with countless changes , variations , and modifications ; without conscious artistic purpose , with no sense of personal control or possession , with no constructive aim either in plot or treatment ; no composition in the modern sense of the term . Such a mass of poetic material in the possession of a large community was , in a sense , fluid , and ran into a thousand forms almost without direction or premeditation . Constant use of such rich material gave a poetic turn of thought and speech to countless persons who , under other conditions , would have given no sign of the possession of the faculty of imagination .</p>
    <p n="11">There was not only the stimulus to the faculty which sees events and occurrences with the eyes of the imagination , but there was also constant and familiar use of the language of poetry . To speak metrically or rhythmically is no difficult matter if one is in the atmosphere or habit of verse-making ; and there is nothing surprising either in the feats of memory or of improvisation performed by the minstrels and balladists of the old time . The faculty of improvising was easily developed and was very generally used by people of all classes . This facility is still possessed by rural populations , among whom songs are still composed as they are sting , each member of the company contributing a new verse or a variation , suggested by local conditions , of a well-known stanza . When to the possession of a mass of traditions and stories and of facility of improvisation is added the habit of singing and dancing , it is not difficult to reconstruct in our own thought the conditions under which popular poetry came into being , nor to understand in what sense a community can make its own songs . In the brave days when ballads were made , the rustic peoples were not mute , as they are to-day ; nor sad , as they have become in so many parts of England . They sang and they danced by instinct and as an expression of social feeling . Originally the ballads were not only sung , but they gave measure to the dance ; they grew from mouth to mouth in the very act of dancing ; individual dancers adding verse to verse , and the frequent refrain coming in as a kind of chorus . Gesture and , to a certain extent , acting would naturally accompany so free and general an expression of community feeling . There was no poet , because all were poets . To quote Professor ten Brink once more :—</p>
    <p n="12">“ Song and playing were cultivated by peasants , and even by freedmen and serfs . At beer-feasts the harp went from hand to hand . Herein lies the essential difference between that age and our own . The result of poetical activity was not the property and was not the production of a single person , but of the community . The work of the individual endured only as long as its delivery lasted . He gained personal distinction only as a virtuoso . The permanent elements of what he presented , the material , the ideas , even the style and metre , already existed . ‘ The work of the singer was only a ripple in the stream of national poetry . Who can say how much the individual contributed to it , or where in his poetical recitation memory ceased and creative impulse began ! In any case the work of the individual lived on only as the ideal possession of the aggregate body of the people , and it soon lost the stamp of originality . In view of such a development of poetry , we must assume a time when the collective consciousness of a people or race is paramount in its unity ; when the intellectual life of each is nourished from the same treasury of views and associations , of myths and sagas ; when similar interests stir each breast ; and the ethical judgment of all applies itself to the same standard . In such an age the form of poetical expression will also be common to all , necessarily solemn , earnest , and simple . ”</p>
    <p n="13">When the conditions which produced the popular ballads become clear to the imagination , their depth of rootage , not only in the community life but in the community love , becomes also clear . We under stand the charm which these old songs have for us of a later age , and the spell which they cast upon men and women who knew the secret of their birth ; we understand why the minstrels of the lime , when popular poetry was in its best estate , were held in such honour , why Taillefer sang the song of Roland at the head of the advancing Normans on the day of Hastings , and why good Bishop Aldhelm , when he wanted to get the ears of his people , stood on the bridge and sang a ballad ! These old songs were the flowering of the imagination of the people ; they drew their life as directly from the general experience , the common memory , the universal feelings , as did the Greek dramas in those primitive times , when they were part of rustic festivity and worship . The popular ballads have passed away with the conditions which produced them . Modern poets have , in several instances , written ballads of striking picturesqueness and power , but as unlike the ballad of popular origin as the world of to-day is unlike the world in which “ Chevy Chase ” was first sung . These modern ballads are not necessarily better or worse than their predecessors ; but they are necessarily different . It is idle to exalt the wild flower at the expense of the garden flower ; each has its fragrance , its beauty , its sentiment ; and the world is wide !</p>
    <p n="14">In the selection of the ballads which appear in this volume , no attempt has been made to follow a chronological order or to enforce a rigid principle of selection of any kind . The aim has been to bring within moderate compass a collection of these songs of the people which should fairly represent the range , the descriptive felicity , the dramatic power , and the genuine poetic feeling of a body of verse which is still , it is to be feared , unfamiliar to a large number of those to whom it would bring refreshment and delight .</p>
