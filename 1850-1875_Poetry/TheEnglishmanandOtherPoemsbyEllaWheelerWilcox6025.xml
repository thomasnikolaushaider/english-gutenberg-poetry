       <l n="14">Shall the Flags of all Nations be half-mast-furled ,</l>
       <l n="15">For the silent lady of royal birth</l>
       <l n="16">Who is riding away from the Courts of earth ,</l>

       <l n="1">Born in the flesh , and bred in the bone ,</l>
       <l n="2">Some of us harbour still</l>
       <l n="3">A New World pride : and we flaunt or hide</l>
       <l n="4">The Spirit of Bunker Hill .</l>
       <l n="5">We claim our place , as a separate race ,</l>
       <l n="6">Or a self-created clan ;</l>
       <l n="7">Till there comes a day when we like to say ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">For under the front that seems so cold ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the voice that is wont to storm ,</l>
       <l n="11">We are certain to find , a big , broad mind</l>
       <l n="12">And a heart that is soft and warm .</l>
       <l n="13">And he carries his woes in a lordly way ,</l>
       <l n="14">As only the great souls can :</l>
       <l n="15">And it makes us glad when in truth we say ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">He slams his door in the face of the world ,</l>
       <l n="18">If he thinks the world too bold .</l>
       <l n="19">He will even curse ; but he opens his purse</l>
       <l n="20">To the poor , and the sick , and the old .</l>
       <l n="21">He is slow in giving to woman the vote ,</l>
       <l n="22">And slow to put up her fan ;</l>
       <l n="23">But he gives her room in the hour of doom ,</l>
       <l n="24">And dies — like an Englishman .</l>

       <l n="43">Nor can his soul find rest in any teaching ,</l>

     <p>Oh , when he knows this truth in all its splendour , What majesty , what glory crowns his life : And , one with God , his every thought is tender ; He cannot enter into war , or strife . His love goes out to every race and nation ; His whole religion lies in being kind . THIS IS THE CREED THAT MEANS THE WORLD 'S SALVATION ; THE BIRTH OF CHRIST IN EVERY MORTAL MIND . ( God rules , God rules alway . )</p>

       <l n="11">And counted the billows that broke on the rocks ;</l>
       <l n="12">The tide lilted in with a rhythmical motion ;</l>
       <l n="13">The sea-gulls dipped downward in time-keeping flocks .</l>
       <l n="14">I watched while a giant wave gathered its forces ,</l>
       <l n="15">And then on the gray granite precipice burst ;</l>
       <l n="16">And I knew as I counted , while other waves mounted ,</l>
       <l n="17">I knew the tenth billow would rhyme with the first .</l>

       <l n="18">Below in the village a church bell was chiming ,</l>
       <l n="19">And back in the woodland a little bird sang ;</l>
       <l n="20">And , doubt it who will , yet those two sounds were rhyming ,</l>
       <l n="21">As out o'er the hill-tops they echoed and rang .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="22">The Wind and the Trees fell to talking together ;</l>

       <l n="24">But everything spoken was told in unbroken</l>
       <l n="25">And beautiful rhyming and rhythmical verse .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="26">So rhythm I hail it , though critics assail it ,</l>
       <l n="27">And hold melting rhymes as an insult to art ,</l>
       <l n="28">For oh ! the sweet swing of it , oh ! the dear ring of it ,</l>
       <l n="29">Oh ! the strong pulse of it , right from the heart ,</l>
       <l n="30">Art or no art .</l>

       <l n="3">And pretty Annette , in a calico gown</l>
       <l n="4">( Bringing her marketing things from town ) ,</l>
       <l n="5">Stopped short with her Sunday store ,</l>
       <l n="6">And wondered if ever it should betide</l>

       <l n="9">A lord there was , oh a lonely soul ,</l>

       <l n="11">His years were young but his heart was old ,</l>
       <l n="12">And he hated his coaches and hated his gold</l>
       <l n="13">( Those things which we all adore ) .</l>
       <l n="14">And he thought how sweet it would be to trudge</l>
       <l n="15">Along with the fair little country drudge ,</l>
       <l n="16">And away from his coach and four .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">So back he rode the very next day</l>
       <l n="18">All in his coach and four ,</l>

       <l n="20">Until he married the sweet Annette</l>
       <l n="21">( In spite of her lack of lore ) .</l>
       <l n="22">But they did n't trudge off on foot together ,</l>
       <l n="23">For he bought her a hat with a long , long feather ,</l>
       <l n="24">And they rode in the coach and four .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">Now a thing like this could happen we know ,</l>
       <l n="26">All in a coach and four ;</l>
       <l n="27">But the fact of it is , ‘ twixt me and you ,</l>
       <l n="28">There is n't a word of the story true</l>
       <l n="29">( Pardon I do implore ) .</l>
       <l n="30">It is only a foolish and fanciful song</l>
       <l n="31">That came to me as I rode along ,</l>
