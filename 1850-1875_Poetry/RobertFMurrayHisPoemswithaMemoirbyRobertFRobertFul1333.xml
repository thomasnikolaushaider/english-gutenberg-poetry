   <head>R. F. MURRAY — 1863-1893</head>
   <p>Much is written about success and failure in the career of literature , about the reasons which enable one man to reach the front , and another to earn his livelihood , while a third , in appearance as likely as either of them , fails and , perhaps , faints by the way . Mr. R. F. Murray , the author of The Scarlet Gown , was among those who do not attain success , in spite of qualities which seem destined to ensure it , and who fall out of the ranks . To him , indeed , success and the rewards of this world , money , and praise , did by no means seem things to be snatched at . To him success meant earning by his pen the very modest sum which sufficed for his wants , and the leisure necessary for serious essays in poetry . Fate denied him even this , in spite of his charming natural endowment of humour , of tenderness , of delight in good letters , and in nature . He died young ; he was one of those whose talent matures slowly , and he died before he came into the full possession of his intellectual kingdom . He had the ambition to excel , [ Greek text ] , as the Homeric motto of his University runs , and he was on the way to excellence when his health broke down . He lingered for two years and passed away .</p>
   <p>It is a familiar story , the story of lettered youth ; of an ambition , or rather of an ideal ; of poverty ; of struggles in the ‘ dusty and stony ways ’ ; of intellectual task-work ; of a true love consoling the last months of weakness and pain . The tale is not repeated here because it is novel , nor even because in its hero we have to regret an ‘ inheritor of unfulfilled renown . ’ It is not the genius so much as the character of this St. Andrews student which has won the sympathy of his biographer , and may win , he hopes , the sympathy of others . In Mr. Murray I feel that I have lost that rare thing , a friend ; a friend whom the chances of life threw in my way , and withdrew again ere we had time and opportunity for perfect recognition . Those who read his Letters and Remains may also feel this emotion of sympathy and regret .</p>
   <p>He was young in years , and younger in heart , a lover of youth ; and youth , if it could learn and could be warned , might win a lesson from his life . Many of us have trod in his path , and , by some kindness of fate , have found from it a sunnier exit into longer days and more fortunate conditions . Others have followed this well-beaten road to the same early and quiet end as his .</p>
   <p>The life and the letters of Murray remind one strongly of Thomas Davidson 's , as published in that admirable and touching biography , A Scottish Probationer . It was my own chance to be almost in touch with both these gentle , tuneful , and kindly humorists . Davidson was a Borderer , born on the skirts of ‘ stormy Ruberslaw , ’ in the country of James Thomson , of Leyden , of the old Ballad minstrels . The son of a Scottish peasant line of the old sort , honourable , refined , devout , he was educated in Edinburgh for the ministry of the United Presbyterian Church . Some beautiful verses of his appeared in the St. Andrews University Magazine about 1863 , at the time when I first ‘ saw myself in print ’ in the same periodical . Davidson 's poem delighted me : another of his , ‘ Ariadne in Naxos , ’ appeared in the Cornhill Magazine about the same time . Mr. Thackeray , who was then editor , no doubt remembered Pen 's prize poem on the same subject . I did not succeed in learning anything about the author , did not know that he lived within a drive of my own home . When next I heard of him , it was in his biography . As a ‘ Probationer , ’ or unplaced minister , he , somehow , was not successful . A humorist , a poet , a delightful companion , he never became ‘ a placed minister . ’ It was the old story of an imprudence , a journey made in damp clothes , of consumption , of the end of his earthly life and love . His letters to his betrothed , his poems , his career , constantly remind one of Murray 's , who must often have joined in singing Davidson 's song , so popular with St. Andrews students , The Banks of the Yang-tse-kiang . Love of the Border , love of Murray 's ‘ dear St. Andrews Bay , ’ love of letters , make one akin to both of these friends who were lost before their friendship was won . Why did not Murray succeed to the measure of his most modest desire ? If we examine the records of literary success , we find it won , in the highest fields , by what , for want of a better word , we call genius ; in the lower paths , by an energy which can take pleasure in all and every exercise of pen and ink , and can communicate its pleasure to others . Now for Murray one does not venture , in face of his still not wholly developed talent , and of his checked career , to claim genius . He was not a Keats , a Burns , a Shelley : he was not , if one may choose modern examples , a Kipling or a Stevenson . On the other hand , his was a high ideal ; he believed , with Andre Chenier , that he had ‘ something there , ’ something worthy of reverence and of careful training within him . Consequently , as we shall see , the drudgery of the pressman was excessively repulsive to him . He could take no delight in making the best of it . We learn that Mr. Kipling 's early tales were written as part of hard daily journalistic work in India ; written in torrid newspaper offices , to fill columns . Yet they were written with the delight of the artist , and are masterpieces in their genre . Murray could not make the best of ordinary pen-work in this manner . Again , he was incapable of ‘ transactions , ’ of compromises ; most honourably incapable of earning his bread by agreeing , or seeming to agree with opinions which were not his . He could not endure ( here I think he was wrong ) to have his pieces of light and mirthful verse touched in any way by an editor . Even where no opinions were concerned , even where an editor has ( to my mind ) a perfect right to alter anonymous contributions , Murray declined to be edited . I ventured to remonstrate with him , to say non est tanti , but I spoke too late , or spoke in vain . He carried independence too far , or carried it into the wrong field , for a piece of humorous verse , say in Punch , is not an original masterpiece and immaculate work of art , but more or less of a joint-stock product between the editor , the author , and the public . Macaulay , and Carlyle , and Sir Walter Scott suffered editors gladly or with indifference , and who are we that we should complain ? This extreme sensitiveness would always have stood in Murray 's way .</p>
   <p>Once more , Murray 's interest in letters was much more energetic than his zeal in the ordinary industry of a student . As a general rule , men of original literary bent are not exemplary students at college . ‘ The common curricoolum , ’ as the Scottish laird called academic studies generally , rather repels them . Macaulay took no honours at Cambridge ; mathematics defied him . Scott was ‘ the Greek dunce , ’ at Edinburgh . Thackeray , Shelley , Gibbon , did not cover themselves with college laurels ; they read what pleased them , they did not read ‘ for the schools . ’ In short , this behaviour at college is the rule among men who are to be distinguished in literature , not the exception . The honours attained at Oxford by Mr. Swinburne , whose Greek verses are no less poetical than his English poetry , were inconspicuous . At St. Andrews , Murray read only ‘ for human pleasure , ’ like Scott , Thackeray , Shelley , and the rest , at Edinburgh , Oxford , and Cambridge . In this matter , I think , he made an error , and one which affected his whole career . He was not a man of private fortune , like some of those whom we have mentioned . He had not a business ready for him to step into . He had to force his own way in life , had to make himself ‘ self-supporting . ’ This was all the more essential to a man of his honourable independence of character , a man who not only would not ask a favour , but who actually shrunk back from such chances as were offered to him , if these chances seemed to be connected with the least discernible shadow of an obligation . At St. Andrews , had he chosen to work hard in certain branches of study , he might probably have gained an exhibition , gone to Oxford or elsewhere , and , by winning a fellowship , secured the leisure which was necessary for the development of his powers . I confess to believing in strenuous work at the classics , as offering , apart from all material reward , the best and most solid basis , especially where there is no exuberant original genius , for the career of a man of letters . The mental discipline is invaluable , the training in accuracy is invaluable , and invaluable is the life led in the society of the greatest minds , the noblest poets , the most faultless artists of the world . To descend to ordinary truths , scholarship is , at lowest , an honourable gagne-pain . But Murray , like the majority of students endowed with literary originality , did not share these rather old-fashioned ideas . The clever Scottish student is apt to work only too hard , and , perhaps , is frequently in danger of exhausting his powers before they are mature , and of injuring his health before it is confirmed . His ambitions , to lookers-on , may seem narrow and school - boyish , as if he were merely emulous , and eager for a high place in his ‘ class , ’ as lectures are called in Scotland . This was Murray 's own view , and he certainly avoided the dangers of academic over-work . He read abundantly , but , as Fitzgerald says , he read ‘ for human pleasure . ’ He never was a Greek scholar , he disliked Philosophy , as presented to him in class-work ; the gods had made him poetical , not metaphysical .</p>
   <p>There was one other cause of his lack of even such slender commercial success in letters as was really necessary to a man who liked ‘ plain living and high thinking . ’ He fell early in love with a city , with a place — he lost his heart to St. Andrews . Here , at all events , his critic can sympathise with him . His ‘ dear St. Andrews Bay , ’ beautiful alike in winter mists and in the crystal days of still winter sunshine ; the quiet brown streets brightened by the scarlet gowns ; the long limitless sands ; the dark blue distant hills , and far-off snowy peaks of the Grampians ; the majestic melancholy towers , monuments of old religion overthrown ; the deep dusky porch of the college chapel , with Kennedy 's arms in wrought iron on the oaken door ; the solid houses with their crow steps and gables , all the forlorn memories of civil and religious feud , of inhabitants saintly , royal , heroic , endeared St. Andrews to Murray . He could not say , like our other poet to Oxford , ‘ Farewell , dear city of youth and dream ! ’ His whole nature needed the air , ‘ like wine . ’ He found , as he remarks , ‘ health and happiness in the German Ocean , ’ swimming out beyond the ‘ lake ’ where the witches were dipped ; walking to the grey little coast-towns , with their wealth of historic documents , their ancient kirks and graves ; dreaming in the vernal woods of Mount Melville or Strathtyrum ; rambling ( without a fishing-rod ) in the charmed ‘ dens ’ of the Kenley burn , a place like Tempe in miniature : these things were Murray 's usual enjoyments , and they became his indispensable needs . His peculiarly shy and , as it were , silvan nature , made it physically impossible for him to live in crowded streets and push his way through throngs of indifferent men . He could not live even in Edinburgh ; he made the effort , and his health , at no time strong , seems never to have recovered from the effects of a few months spent under a roof in a large town . He hurried back to St. Andrews : her fascination was too powerful . Hence it is that , dying with his work scarcely begun , he will always be best remembered as the poet of The Scarlet Gown , the Calverley or J. K. S. of Kilrymont ; endowed with their humour , their skill in parody , their love of youth , but ( if I am not prejudiced ) with more than the tenderness and natural magic of these regretted writers . Not to be able to endure crowds and towns , ( a matter of physical health and constitution , as well as of temperament ) was , of course , fatal to an ordinary success in journalism . On the other hand , Murray 's name is inseparably connected with the life of youth in the little old college , in the University of the Admirable Crichton and Claverhouse , of the great Montrose and of Ferguson ,— the harmless Villon of Scotland ,— the University of almost all the famous Covenanters , and of all the valiant poet-Cavaliers . Murray has sung of the life and pleasures of its students , of examinations and Gaudeamuses — supper parties — he has sung of the sands , the links , the sea , the towers , and his name and fame are for ever blended with the air of his city of youth and dream . It is not a wide name or a great fame , but it is what he would have desired , and we trust that it may be long - lived and enduring . We are not to wax elegiac , and adopt a tearful tone over one so gallant and so uncomplaining . He failed , but he was undefeated .</p>
   <p>In the following sketch of Murray 's life and work use is made of his letters , chiefly of letters to his mother . They always illustrate his own ideas and attempts ; frequently they throw the light of an impartial and critical mind on the distinguished people whom Murray observed from without . It is worth remarking that among many remarks on persons , I have found not one of a censorious , cynical , envious , or unfriendly nature . Youth is often captious and keenly critical ; partly because youth generally has an ideal , partly , perhaps chiefly , from mere intellectual high spirits and sense of the incongruous ; occasionally the motive is jealousy or spite . Murray 's sense of fun was keen , his ideal was lofty ; of envy , of an injured sense of being neglected , he does not show one trace . To make fun of their masters and pastors , tutors , professors , is the general and not necessarily unkind tendency of pupils . Murray rarely mentions any of the professors in St. Andrews except in terms of praise , which is often enthusiastic . Now , as he was by no means a prize student , or pattern young man for a story-book , this generosity is a high proof of an admirable nature . If he chances to speak to his mother about a bore , and he did not suffer bores gladly , he not only does not name the person , but gives no hint by which he might be identified . He had much to embitter him , for he had a keen consciousness of ‘ the something within him , ’ of the powers which never found full expression ; and he saw others advancing and prospering while he seemed to be standing still , or losing ground in all ways . But no word of bitterness ever escapes him in the correspondence which I have seen . In one case he has to speak of a disagreeable and disappointing interview with a man from whom he had been led to expect sympathy and encouragement . He told me about this affair in conversation ; ‘ There were tears in my eyes as I turned from the house , ’ he said , and he was not effusive . In a letter to Mrs. Murray he describes this unlucky interview ,— a discouragement caused by a manner which was strange to Murray , rather than by real unkindness ,— and he describes it with a delicacy , with a reserve , with a toleration , beyond all praise . These are traits of a character which was greater and more rare than his literary talent : a character quite developed , while his talent was only beginning to unfold itself , and to justify his belief in his powers .</p>
   <p>Robert Murray was the eldest child of John and Emmeline Murray : the father a Scot , the mother of American birth . He was born at Roxbury , in Massachusetts , on December 26th , 1863 . It may be fancy , but , in his shy reserve , his almost farouche independence , one seems to recognise the Scot ; while in his cast of literary talent , in his natural ‘ culture , ’ we observe the son of a refined American lady . To his mother he could always write about the books which were interesting him , with full reliance on her sympathy , though indeed , he does not often say very much about literature .</p>
   <p>Till 1869 he lived in various parts of New England , his father being a Unitarian minister . ‘ He was a remarkably cheerful and affectionate child , and seldom seemed to find anything to trouble him . ’ In 1869 his father carried him to England , Mrs. Murray and a child remaining in America . For more than a year the boy lived with kinsfolk near Kelso , the beautiful old town on the Tweed where Scott passed some of his childish days . In 1871 the family were reunited at York , where he was fond of attending the services in the Cathedral . Mr. Murray then took charge of the small Unitarian chapel of Blackfriars , at Canterbury . Thus Murray 's early youth was passed in the mingled influences of Unitarianism at home , and of Cathedral services at York , and in the church where Becket suffered martyrdom . A not unnatural result was a somewhat eclectic and unconstrained religion . He thought but little of the differences of creed , believing that all good men held , in essentials , much the same faith . His view of essentials was generous , as he admitted . He occasionally spoke of himself as ‘ sceptical , ’ that is , in contrast with those whose faith was more definite , more dogmatic , more securely based on ‘ articles . ’ To illustrate Murray 's religious attitude , at least as it was in 1887 , one may quote from a letter of that year ( April 17 ) .</p>
   <p>‘ There was a University sermon , and I thought I would go and hear it . So I donned my old cap and gown and felt quite proud of them . The preacher was Bishop Wordsworth . He goes in for the union of the Presbyterian and Episcopalian Churches , and is glad to preach in a Presbyterian Church , as he did this morning . How the aforesaid Union is to be brought about , I 'm sure I do n't know , for I am pretty certain that the Episcopalians wo n't give up their bishops , and the Presbyterians wo n't have them on any account . However , that 's neither here nor there — at least it does not affect the fact that Wordsworth is a first-rate man , and a fine preacher . I dare say you know he is a nephew or grand-nephew of the Poet . He is a most venerable old man , and worth looking at , merely for his exterior . He is so feeble with age that he can with difficulty climb the three short steps that lead into the pulpit ; but , once in the pulpit , it is another thing . There is no feebleness when he begins to preach . He is one of the last voices of the old orthodox school , and I wish there were hundreds like him . If ever a man believed in his message , Wordsworth does . And though I cannot follow him in his veneration for the Thirty-nine Articles , the way in which he does makes me half wish I could . . . . It was full of wisdom and the beauty of holiness , which even I , poor sceptic and outcast , could recognise and appreciate . After all , he did n't get it from the Articles , but from his own human heart , which , he told us , was deceitful and desperately wicked .</p>
   <p>‘ Confound it , how stupid we all are ! Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Unitarians , Agnostics ; the whole lot of us . We all believe the same things , to a great extent ; but we must keep wrangling about the data from which we infer these beliefs . . . I believe a great deal that he does , but I certainly do n't act up to my belief as he does to his . ’</p>
   <p>The belief ‘ up to ’ which Murray lived was , if it may be judged by its fruits , that of a Christian man . But , in this age , we do find the most exemplary Christian conduct in some who have discarded dogma and resigned hope . Probably Murray would not the less have regarded these persons as Christians . If we must make a choice , it is better to have love and charity without belief , than belief of the most intense kind , accompanied by such love and charity as John Knox bore to all who differed from him about a mass or a chasuble , a priest or a presbyter . This letter , illustrative of the effect of cathedral services on a young Unitarian , is taken out of its proper chronological place .</p>
   <p>From Canterbury Mr. Murray went to Ilminster in Somerset . Here Robert attended the Grammar School ; in 1879 he went to the Grammar School of Crewkerne . In 1881 he entered at the University of St. Andrews , with a scholarship won as an external student of Manchester New College . This he resigned not long after , as he had abandoned the idea of becoming a Unitarian minister .</p>
   <p>No longer a schoolboy , he was now a Bejant ( bec jaune ? ) , to use the old Scotch term for ‘ freshman . ’ He liked the picturesque word , and opposed the introduction of ‘ freshman . ’ Indeed he liked all things old , and , as a senior man , was a supporter of ancient customs and of esprit de corps in college . He fell in love for life with that old and grey enchantress , the city of St. Margaret , of Cardinal Beaton , of Knox and Andrew Melville , of Archbishop Sharp , and Samuel Rutherford . The nature of life and education in a Scottish university is now , probably , better understood in England than it used to be . Of the Scottish universities , St. Andrews varies least , though it varies much , from Oxford and Cambridge . Unlike the others , Aberdeen , Glasgow , and Edinburgh , the United College of St. Leonard and St. Salvator is not lost in a large town . The College and the Divinity Hall of St. Mary 's are a survival from the Middle Ages . The University itself arose from a voluntary association of the learned in 1410 . Privileges were conferred on this association by Bishop Wardlaw in 1411 . It was intended as a bulwark against Lollard ideas . In 1413 the Antipope Benedict XIII ., to whom Scotland then adhered , granted six bulls of confirmation to the new University . Not till 1430 did Bishop Wardlaw give a building in South Street , the Paedagogium . St. Salvator 's College was founded by Bishop Kennedy ( 1440-1466 ): it was confirmed by Pius II . in 1458 . Kennedy endowed his foundation richly with plate ( a silver mace is still extant ) and with gorgeous furniture and cloth of gold . St. Leonard 's was founded by Prior Hepburn in 1512 . Of St. Salvator 's the ancient chapel still remains , and is in use . St. Leonard 's was merged with St. Salvator 's in the last century : its chapel is now roofless , some of the old buildings remain , much modernised , but on the south side fronting the gardens they are still picturesque . Both Colleges were , originally , places of residence for the students , as at Oxford and Cambridge , and the discipline , especially at St. Leonard 's , was rather monastic . The Reformation caused violent changes ; all through these troubled ages the new doctrines , and then the violent Presbyterian pretensions to clerical influence in politics , and the Covenant and the Restoration and Revolution , kept busy the dwellers in what should have been ‘ quiet collegiate cloisters . ’ St. Leonard 's was more extreme , on Knox 's side , than St. Salvator 's , but was also more devoted to King James in 1715 . From St. Andrews Simon Lovat went to lead his abominable old father 's clan , on the Prince Regent 's side , in 1745 . Golf and archery , since the Reformation at least , were the chief recreations of the students , and the archery medals bear all the noblest names of the North , including those of Argyll and the great Marquis of Montrose . Early in the present century the old ruinous college buildings of St. Salvator 's ceased to be habitable , except by a ghost ! There is another spectre of a noisy sort in St. Leonard 's . The new buildings are mere sets of class-rooms , the students live where they please , generally in lodgings , which they modestly call bunks . There is a hall for dinners in common ; it is part of the buildings of the Union , a new hall added to an ancient house .</p>
   <p>It was thus to a university with ancient associations , with a religio loci , and with more united and harmonious student-life than is customary in Scotland , that Murray came in 1881 . How clearly his biographer remembers coming to the same place , twenty years earlier ! how vivid is his memory of quaint streets , grey towers , and the North Sea breaking in heavy rollers on the little pier !</p>
   <p>Though , like a descendant of Archbishop Sharp , and a winner of the archery medal , I boast myself Sancti Leonardi alumnus addictissimus , I am unable to give a description , at first hand , of student life in St. Andrews . In my time , a small set of ‘ men ’ lived together in what was then St. Leonard 's Hall . The buildings that remain on the site of Prior Hepburn 's foundation , or some of them , were turned into a hall , where we lived together , not scattered in bunks . The existence was mainly like that of pupils of a private tutor ; seven-eighths of private tutor to one - eighth of a college in the English universities . We attended the lectures in the University , we distinguished ourselves no more than Murray would have approved of , and many of us have remained united by friendship through half a lifetime .</p>
   <p>It was a pleasant existence , and the perfume of buds and flowers in the old gardens , hard by those where John Knox sat and talked with James Melville and our other predecessors at St. Leonard 's , is fragrant in our memories . It was pleasant , but St. Leonard 's Hall has ceased to be , and the life there was not the life of the free and hardy bunk-dwellers . Whoso pined for such dissipated pleasures as the chill and dark streets of St. Andrews offer to the gay and rousing blade , was not encouraged . We were very strictly ‘ gated , ’ though the whole society once got out of window , and , by way of protest , made a moonlight march into the country . We attended ‘ gaudeamuses ’ and solatia — University suppers — but little ; indeed , he who writes does not remember any such diversions of boys who beat the floor , and break the glass . To plant the standard of cricket in the remoter gardens of our country , in a region devastated by golf , was our ambition , and here we had no assistance at all from the University . It was chiefly at lecture , at football on the links , and in the debating societies that we met our fellow-students ; like the celebrated starling , ‘ we could not get out , ’ except to permitted dinners and evening parties . Consequently one could only sketch student life with a hand faltering and untrained . It was very different with Murray and his friends . They were their own masters , could sit up to all hours , smoking , talking , and , I dare say , drinking . As I gather from his letters , Murray drank nothing stronger than water . There was a certain kind of humour in drink , he said , but he thought it was chiefly obvious to the sober spectator . As the sober spectator , he sang of violent delights which have violent ends . He may best be left to illustrate student life for himself . The ‘ waster ’ of whom he chants is the slang name borne by the local fast man .</p>

   <p>‘ I have not worked for my classes this session , ’ he writes ( 1884 ) , ‘ and shall not take any places . ’ The five or six most distinguished pupils used , at least in my time , to receive prize-books decorated with the University 's arms . These prize-men , no doubt , held the ‘ places ’ alluded to by Murray . If he was idle , ‘ I speak of him but brotherly , ’ having never held any ‘ place ’ but that of second to Mr. Wallace , now Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford , in the Greek Class ( Mr. Sellar 's ) . Why was one so idle , in Latin ( Mr. Shairp ) , in Morals ( Mr. Ferrier ) , in Logic ( Mr. Veitch ) ? but Logic was unintelligible .</p>
   <p>‘ I must confess , ’ remarks Murray , in a similar spirit of pensive regret , ‘ that I have not had any ambition to distinguish myself either in Knight 's ( Moral Philosophy ) or in Butler 's . ’ { 1 }</p>
   <p>Murray then speaks with some acrimony about earnest students , whose motive , he thinks , is a small ambition . But surely a man may be fond of metaphysics for the sweet sake of Queen Entelechy , and , moreover , these students looked forward to days in which real work would bear fruit .</p>
   <p>‘ You must grind up the opinions of Plato , Aristotle , and a lot of other men , concerning things about which they knew nothing , and we know nothing , taking these opinions at second or third hand , and never looking into the works of these men ; for to a man who wants to take a place , there is no time for anything of that sort . ’</p>
   <p>Why not ? The philosophers ought to be read in their own language , as they are now read . The remarks on the most fairy of philosophers — Plato ; on the greatest of all minds , that of Aristotle , are boyish . Again ‘ I speak but brotherly , ’ remembering an old St. Leonard 's essay in which Virgil was called ‘ the furtive Mantuan , ’ and another , devoted to ridicule of Euripides . But Plato and Aristotle we never blasphemed .</p>
   <p>Murray adds that he thinks , next year , of taking the highest Greek Class , and English Literature . In the latter , under Mr. Baynes , he took the first place , which he mentions casually to Mrs. Murray about a year after date :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">In Greek , despite his enthusiastic admiration of the professor , Mr .</l>
     <l n="6">Campbell , he did not much enjoy himself :—</l>

     <l n="16">Some stuff that a Greek</l>
     <l n="17">With his delicate cheek</l>
     <l n="18">Would smile at as ‘ barbarous ’ — faith , he well might .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">

     <l n="20">The source of my woes !</l>
     <l n="21">( This metre 's too tough , I must draw to a close . )</l>
     <l n="22">May Sargent be drowned</l>
     <l n="23">In the ocean profound ,</l>
     <l n="24">And Sidgwick be food for the carrion crows ! ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Greek prose is a stubborn thing , and the biographer remembers being told that his was ‘ the best , with the worst mistakes ’ ; also frequently by Mr. Sellar , that it was ‘ bald . ’ But Greek prose is splendid practice , and no less good practice is Greek and Latin verse . These exercises , so much sneered at , are the Dwellers on the Threshold of the life of letters . They are haunting forms of fear , but they have to be wrestled with , like the Angel ( to change the figure ) , till they bless you , and make words become , in your hands , like the clay of the modeller . Could we write Greek like Mr. Jebb , we would never write anything else .</p>
   <p>Murray had naturally , it seems , certainly not by dint of wrestling with Greek prose , the mastery of language . His light verse is wonderfully handled , quaint , fluent , right . Modest as he was , he was ambitious , as we said , but not ambitious of any gain ; merely eager , in his own way , to excel . His ideal is plainly stated in the following verses :—</p>

   <p>He was fond , too fond , of long midnight walks , for in these he overtasked his strength , and he had all a young man 's contempt for maxims about not sitting in wet clothes and wet boots . Early in his letters he speaks of bad colds , and it is matter of tradition that he despised flannel . Most of us have been like him , and have found pleasure in wading Tweed , for example , when chill with snaw-bree . In brief , while reading about Murray 's youth most men must feel that they are reading , with slight differences , about their own . He writes thus of his long darkling tramps , in a rhymed epistle to his friend C. C. C .</p>

   <p>One fancies him roaming solitary , after midnight , in the dark deserted streets . He passes the deep porch of the College Church , and the spot where Patrick Hamilton was burned . He goes down to the Castle by the sea , where , some say , the murdered Cardinal may now and again be seen , in his red hat . In South Street he hears the roll and rattle of the viewless carriage which sounds in that thoroughfare . He loiters under the haunted tower on Hepburn 's precinct wall , the tower where the lady of the bright locks lies , with white gloves on her hands . Might he not share , in the desolate Cathedral , La Messe des Morts , when all the lost souls of true lovers are allowed to meet once a year . Here be they who were too fond when Culdees ruled , or who loved young monks of the Priory ; here be ladies of Queen Mary 's Court , and the fair inscrutable Queen herself , with Chastelard , that died at St. Andrews for desire of her ; and poor lassies and lads who were over gay for Andrew Melville and Mr. Blair ; and Miss Pett , who tended young Montrose , and may have had a tenderness for his love-locks . They are a triste good company , tender and true , as the lovers of whom M. Anatole France has written ( La Messe des Morts ) . Above the witches ’ lake come shadows of the women who suffered under Knox and the Bastard of Scotland , poor creatures burned to ashes with none to help or pity . The shades of Dominicans flit by the Black Friars wall — verily the place is haunted , and among Murray 's pleasures was this of pacing alone , by night , in that airy press and throng of those who lived and loved and suffered so long ago —</p>

     <l n="1">So in the village inn the poet dwelt .</l>
     <l n="2">His honey-dew was gone ; only the pouch ,</l>
     <l n="3">His cousin 's work , her empty labour , left .</l>

   <p>His was the best good thing of the night 's talk , and the thing that was remembered . He excited himself a good deal over Rectorial Elections . The duties of the Lord Rector and the mode of his election have varied frequently in near five hundred years . In Murray 's day , as in my own , the students elected their own Rector , and before Lord Bute 's energetic reign , the Rector had little to do , but to make a speech , and give a prize . I vaguely remember proposing the author of Tom Brown long ago : he was not , however , in the running .</p>
   <p>Politics often inspire the electors ; occasionally ( I have heard ) grave seniors use their influence , mainly for reasons of academic policy .</p>
   <p>In December 1887 Murray writes about an election in which Mr. Lowell was a candidate . ‘ A pitiful protest was entered by an ’ ( epithets followed by a proper name ) ‘ against Lowell , on the score of his being an alien . Mallock , as you learn , was withdrawn , for which I am truly thankful . ’ Unlucky Mr. Mallock ! ‘ Lowell polled 100 and Gibson 92 . . . The intrigues and corruption appear to be almost worthy of an American Presidential election . ’ Mr. Lowell could not accept a compliment which pleased him , because of his official position , and the misfortune of his birth !</p>
   <p>Murray was already doing a very little ‘ miniature journalism , ’ in the form of University Notes for a local paper . He complains of the ultra Caledonian frankness with which men told him that they were very bad . A needless , if friendly , outspokenness was a feature in Scottish character which he did not easily endure . He wrote a good deal of verse in the little University paper , now called College Echoes .</p>
   <p>If Murray ever had any definite idea of being ordained for the ministry in any ‘ denomination , ’ he abandoned it . His ‘ bursaries ’ ( scholarships or exhibitions ) , on which he had been passing rich , expired , and he had to earn a livelihood . It seems plain to myself that he might easily have done so with his pen . A young friend of my own ( who will excuse me for thinking that his bright verses are not better than Murray 's ) promptly made , by these alone , an income which to Murray would have been affluence . But this could not be done at St. Andrews . Again , Murray was not in contact with people in the centre of newspapers and magazines . He went very little into general society , even at St. Andrews , and thus failed , perhaps , to make acquaintances who might have been ‘ useful . ’ He would have scorned the idea of making useful acquaintances . But without seeking them , why should we reject any friendliness when it offers itself ? We are all members one of another . Murray speaks of his experience of human beings , as rich in examples of kindness and good-will . His shyness , his reserve , his extreme unselfishness ,— carried to the point of diffidence ,— made him rather shun than seek older people who were dangerously likely to be serviceable . His manner , when once he could be induced to meet strangers , was extremely frank and pleasant , but from meeting strangers he shrunk , in his inveterate modesty .</p>
   <p>In 1886 Murray had the misfortune to lose is father , and it became , perhaps , more prominently needful that he should find a profession . He now assisted Professor Meiklejohn of St. Andrews in various kinds of literary and academic work , and in him found a friend , with whom he remained in close intercourse to the last . He began the weary path , which all literary beginners must tread , of sending contributions to magazines . He seldom read magazine articles . ‘ I do not greatly care for “ Problems ” and “ vexed questions . ” I am so much of a problem and a vexed question that I have quite enough to do in searching for a solution of my own personality . ’ He tried a story , based on ‘ a midnight experience ’ of his own ; unluckily he does not tell us what that experience was . Had he encountered one of the local ghosts ?</p>
   <p>‘ My blood-curdling romance I offered to the editor of Longman 's Magazine , but that misguided person was so ill-advised as to return it , accompanied with one of these abominable lithographed forms conveying his hypocritical regrets . ’ Murray sent a directed envelope with a twopenny - halfpenny stamp . The paper came back for three-halfpence by book-post . ‘ I have serious thoughts of sueing him for the odd penny ! ’ ‘ Why should people be fools enough to read my rot when they have twenty volumes of Scott at their command ? ’ He confesses to ‘ a Scott-mania almost as intense as if he were the last new sensation . ’ ‘ I was always fond of him , but I am fonder than ever now . ’ This plunge into the immortal romances seems really to have discouraged Murray ; at all events he says very little more about attempts in fiction of his own . ‘ I am a barren rascal , ’ he writes , quoting Johnson on Fielding . Like other men , Murray felt extreme difficulty in writing articles or tales which have an infinitesimal chance of being accepted . It needs a stout heart to face this almost fixed certainty of rejection : a man is weakened by his apprehensions of a lithographed form , and of his old manuscript coming home to roost , like the Graces of Theocritus , to pine in the dusty chest where is their chill abode . If the Alexandrian poets knew this ill-fortune , so do all beginners in letters . There is nothing for it but ‘ putting a stout heart to a stey brae , ’ as the Scotch proverb says . Editors want good work , and on finding a new man who is good , they greatly rejoice . But it is so difficult to do vigorous and spontaneous work , as it were , in the dark . Murray had not , it is probable , the qualities of the novelist , the narrator . An excellent critic he might have been if he had ‘ descended to criticism , ’ but he had , at this time , no introductions , and probably did not address reviews at random to editors . As to poetry , these much-vexed men receive such enormous quantities of poetry that they usually reject it at a venture , and obtain the small necessary supplies from agreeable young ladies . Had Murray been in London , with a few literary friends , he might soon have been a thriving writer of light prose and light verse . But the enchantress held him ; he hated London , he had no literary friends , he could write gaily for pleasure , not for gain . So , like the Scholar Gypsy , he remained contemplative ,</p>
   <p>‘ Waiting for the spark from heaven to fall . ’</p>
   <p>About this time the present writer was in St. Andrews as Gifford Lecturer in Natural Theology . To say that an enthusiasm for totems and taboos , ghosts and gods of savage men , was aroused by these lectures , would be to exaggerate unpardonably . Efforts to make the students write essays or ask questions were so entire a failure that only one question was received — as to the proper pronunciation of ‘ Myth . ’ Had one been fortunate enough to interest Murray , it must have led to some discussion of his literary attempts . He mentions having attended a lecture given by myself to the Literary Society on ‘ Literature as a Profession , ’ and he found the lecturer ‘ far more at home in such a subject than in the Gifford Lectures . ’ Possibly the hearer was ‘ more at home ’ in literature than in discussions as to the origin of Huitzilopochtli . ‘ Literature , ’ he says , ‘ never was , is not , and never will be , in the ordinary sense of the term , a profession . You can n't teach it as you can the professions , you can n't succeed in it as you can in the professions , by dint of mere diligence and without special aptitude . . . I think all this chatter about the technical and pecuniary sides of literature is extremely foolish and worse than useless . It only serves to glut the idle curiosity of the general public about matters with which they have no concern , a curiosity which ( thanks partly to American methods of journalism ) has become simply outrageous . ’</p>
   <p>Into chatter about the pecuniary aspect of literature the Lecturer need hardly say that he did not meander . It is absolutely true that literature cannot be taught . Maupassant could have dispensed with the instructions of Flaubert . But an ‘ aptitude ’ is needed in all professions , and in such arts as music , and painting , and sculpture , teaching is necessary . In literature , teaching can only come from general education in letters , from experience , from friendly private criticism . But if you cannot succeed in literature ‘ by dint of mere diligence , ’ mere diligence is absolutely essential . Men must read , must observe , must practise . Diligence is as necessary to the author as to the grocer , the solicitor , the dentist , the barrister , the soldier . Nothing but nature can give the aptitude ; diligence must improve it , and experience may direct it . It is not enough to wait for the spark from heaven to fall ; the spark must be caught , and tended , and cherished . A man must labour till he finds his vein , and himself . Again , if literature is an art , it is also a profession . A man 's very first duty is to support himself and those , if any , who are dependent on him . If he cannot do it by epics , tragedies , lyrics , he must do it by articles , essays , tales , or how he honestly can . He must win his leisure by his labour , and give his leisure to his art . Murray , at this time , was diligent in helping to compile and correct educational works . He might , but for the various conditions of reserve , hatred of towns , and the rest , have been earning his leisure by work more brilliant and more congenial to most men . But his theory of literature was so lofty that he probably found the other , the harder , the less remunerative , the less attractive work , more congenial to his tastes .</p>
   <p>He describes , to Mrs. Murray , various notable visitors to St. Andrews : Professor Butcher , who lectured on Lucian , and is ‘ very handsome , ’ Mr. Arthur Balfour , the Lord Rector , who is ‘ rather handsome , ’ and delights the listener by his eloquence ; Mr. Chamberlain , who pleases him too , though he finds Mr. Chamberlain rather acrimonious in his political reflections . About Lucian , the subject of Mr. Butcher 's lecture , Murray says nothing . That brilliant man of letters in general , the Alcibiades of literature , the wittiest , and , rarely , the most tender , and , always , the most graceful , was a model who does not seem to have attracted Murray . Lucian amused , and amuses , and lived by amusing : the vein of romance and poetry that was his he worked but rarely : perhaps the Samosatene did not take himself too seriously , yet he lives through the ages , an example , in many ways to be followed , of a man who obviously delighted in all that he wrought . He was no model to Murray , who only delighted in his moments of inspiration , and could not make himself happy even in the trifles which are demanded from the professional pen .</p>
   <p>He did , at last , endeavour to ply that servile engine of which Pendennis conceived so exalted an opinion . Certainly a false pride did not stand in his way when , on May 5 , 1889 , he announced that he was about to leave St. Andrews , and attempt to get work at proof-correcting and in the humblest sorts of journalism in Edinburgh . The chapter is honourable to his resolution , but most melancholy . There were competence and ease waiting for him , probably , in London , if he would but let his pen have its way in bright comment and occasional verse . But he chose the other course . With letters of introduction from Mr. Meiklejohn , he consulted the houses of Messrs. Clark and Messrs. Constable in Edinburgh . He did not find that his knowledge of Greek was adequate to the higher and more remunerative branches of proof-reading , that weary meticulous toil , so fatiguing to the eyesight . The hours , too , were very long ; he could do more and better work in fewer hours . No time , no strength , were left for reading and writing . He did , while in Edinburgh , send a few things to magazines , but he did not actually ‘ bombard ’ editors . He is ‘ to live in one room , and dine , if not on a red herring , on the next cheapest article of diet . ’ These months of privation , at which he laughed , and some weeks of reading proofs , appear to have quite undermined health which was never strong , and which had been sorely tried by ‘ the wind of a cursed to-day , the curse of a windy to-morrow , ’ at St. Andrews . If a reader observes in Murray a lack of strenuous diligence , he must attribute it less to lack of resolution , than to defect of physical force and energy . The many bad colds of which he speaks were warnings of the end , which came in the form of consumption . This lurking malady it was that made him wait , and dally with his talent . He hit on the idea of translating some of Bossuet 's orations for a Scotch theological publisher . Alas ! the publisher did not anticipate a demand , among Scotch ministers , for the Eagle of Meaux . Murray , in his innocence , was startled by the caution of the publisher , who certainly would have been a heavy loser . ‘ I honestly believe that , if Charles Dickens were now alive and unknown , and were to offer the MS. of Pickwick to an Edinburgh publisher , that sagacious old individual would shake his prudent old head , and refuse ( with the utmost politeness ) to publish it ! ’ There is a good deal of difference between Pickwick and a translation of old French sermons about Madame , and Conde , and people of whom few modern readers ever heard .</p>
   <p>Alone , in Edinburgh , Murray was saddened by the ‘ unregarding ’ irresponsive faces of the people as they passed . In St. Andrews he probably knew every face ; even in Edinburgh ( a visitor from London thinks ) there is a friendly look among the passers . Murray did not find it so . He approached a newspaper office : ‘ he [ the Editor whom he met ] was extremely frank , and told me that the tone of my article on — was underbred , while the verses I had sent him had nothing in them . Very pleasant for the feelings of a young author , was it not ? . . . Unfavourable criticism is an excellent tonic , but it should be a little diluted . . . I must , however , do him the justice to say that he did me a good turn by introducing me to — -  , . . . who was kind and encouraging in the extreme . ’</p>
   <p>Murray now called on the Editor of the Scottish Leader , the Gladstonian organ , whom he found very courteous . He was asked to write some ‘ leader - notes ’ as they are called , paragraphs which appear in the same columns as the leading articles . These were published , to his astonishment , and he was ‘ to be taken on at a salary of — a week . ’ Let us avoid pecuniary chatter , and merely say that the sum , while he was on trial , was not likely to tempt many young men into the career of journalism . Yet ‘ the work will be very exacting , and almost preclude the possibility of my doing anything else . ’ Now , as four leader notes , or , say , six , can be written in an hour , it is difficult to see the necessity for this fatigue . Probably there were many duties more exacting , and less agreeable , than the turning out of epigrams . Indeed there was other work of some more or less mechanical kind , and the manufacture of ‘ leader notes ’ was the least part of Murray 's industry . At the end of two years there was ‘ the prospect of a very fair salary . ’ But there was ‘ night - work and everlasting hurry . ’ ‘ The interviewing of a half-bred Town-Councillor on the subject of gas and paving ’ did not exhilarate Murray . Again , he had to compile a column of Literary News , from the Athenaeum , the Academy , and so on , ‘ with comments and enlargements where possible . ’ This might have been made extremely amusing , it sounds like a delightful task ,— the making of comments on ‘ Mr. — -  has finished a sonnet : ’ ‘ Mr. — -  ‘ s poems are in their fiftieth thousand : ’ ‘ Miss — -  has gone on a tour of health to the banks of the Yang-tse-kiang : ’ ‘ Mrs. — -  is engaged on a novel about the Pilchard Fishery . ’ One could make comments ( if permitted ) on these topics for love , and they might not be unpopular . But perhaps Murray was shackled a little by human respect , or the prejudices of his editor . At all events he calls it ‘ not very inspiring employment . ’ The bare idea , I confess , inspirits me extremely .</p>
   <p>But the literary follet , who delights in mild mischief , did not haunt Murray . He found an opportunity to write on the Canongate Churchyard , where Fergusson lies , under the monument erected by Burns to the boy of genius whom he called his master . Of course the part of the article which dealt with Fergusson , himself a poet of the Scarlet Gown , was cut out . The Scotch do not care to hear about Fergusson , in spite of their ‘ myriad mutchkined enthusiasm ’ for his more illustrious imitator and successor , Burns .</p>
   <p>At this time Edinburgh was honouring itself , and Mr. Parnell , by conferring its citizenship on that patriot . Murray was actually told off ‘ to stand at a given point of the line on which the hero marched , ’ and to write some lines of ‘ picturesque description . ’ This kind of thing could not go on . It was at Nelson 's Monument that he stood : his enthusiasm was more for Nelson than for Mr. Parnell ; and he caught a severe cold on this noble occasion . Murray 's opinions clashed with those of the Scottish Leader , and he withdrew from its service .</p>
   <p>Just a week passed between the Parnellian triumph and Murray 's retreat from daily journalism . ‘ On a newspaper one must have no opinions except those which are favourable to the sale of the paper and the filling of its advertisement columns . ’ That is not precisely an accurate theory . Without knowing anything of the circumstances , one may imagine that Murray was rather impracticable . Of course he could not write against his own opinions , but it is unusual to expect any one to do that , or to find any one who will do it . ‘ Incompatibility of temper ’ probably caused this secession from the newspaper .</p>
   <p>After various attempts to find occupation , he did some proof-reading for Messrs. Constable . Among other things he ‘ read ’ the journal of Lady Mary Coke , privately printed for Lord Home . Lady Mary , who appears as a lively child in The Heart of Midlothian , ‘ had a taste for loo , gossip , and gardening , but the greatest of these is gossip . ’ The best part of the book is Lady Louisa Stuart 's inimitable introduction . Early in October he decided to give up proof-reading : the confinement had already told on his health . In the letter which announces this determination he describes a sermon of Principal Caird : ‘ Voice , gesture , language , thought — all in the highest degree ,— combined to make it the most moving and exalted speech of a man to men that I ever listened to . ’ ‘ The world is too much with me , ’ he adds , as if he and the world were ever friends , or ever likely to be friendly .</p>
   <p>October 27th found him dating from St. Andrews again . ‘ St. Andrews after Edinburgh is Paradise . ’ His Dalilah had called him home to her , and he was never again unfaithful . He worked for his firm friend , Professor Meiklejohn , he undertook some teaching , and he wrote a little . It was at this time that his biographer made Murray 's acquaintance . I had been delighted with his verses in College Echoes , and I asked him to bring me some of his more serious work . But he never brought them : his old enemy , reserve , overcame him . A few of his pieces were published ‘ At the Sign of the Ship ’ in Longman 's Magazine , to which he contributed occasionally .</p>
   <p>From this point there is little in Murray 's life to be chronicled . In 1890 his health broke down entirely , and consumption declared itself . Very early in 1891 he visited Egypt , where it was thought that some educational work might be found for him . But he found Egypt cold , wet , and windy ; of Alexandria and the Mediterranean he says little : indeed he was almost too weak and ill to see what is delightful either in nature or art .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ To aching eyes each landscape lowers ,</l>
     <l n="2">To feverish pulse each gale blows chill ,</l>
     <l n="3">And Araby 's or Eden 's bowers</l>
     <l n="4">Were barren as this moorland hill , ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>says the least self-conscious of poets . Even so barren were the rich Nile and so bleak the blue Mediterranean waters . Though received by the kindest and most hospitable friends , Murray was homesick , and pined to be in England , now that spring was there . He made the great mistake of coming home too early . At Ilminster , in his mother 's home , he slowly faded out of life . I have not the heart to quote his descriptions of brief yet laborious saunters in the coppices , from the letters which he wrote to the lady of his heart . He was calm , cheerful , even buoyant . His letters to his college friends are all concerned with literature , or with happy old times , and are full of interest in them and in their happiness .</p>
   <p>He was not wholly idle . He wrote a number of short pieces of verse in Punch , and two or three in the St. James 's Gazette . Other work , no doubt , he planned , but his strength was gone . In 1891 his book , The Scarlet Gown , was published by his friend , Mr. A. M. Holden . The little volume , despite its local character , was kindly received by the Reviews . Here , it was plain , we had a poet who was to St. Andrews what the regretted J. K. S. was to Eton and Cambridge . This measure of success was not calculated to displease our alumnus addictissimus .</p>
   <p>Friendship and love , he said , made the summer of 1892 very happy to him . I last heard from him in the summer of 1893 , when he sent me some of his most pleasing verses . He was in Scotland ; he had wandered back , a shadow of himself , to his dear St. Andrews . I conceived that he was better ; he said nothing about his health . It is not easy to quote from his letters to his friend , Mr. Wallace , still written in his beautiful firm hand . They are too full of affectionate banter : they also contain criticisms on living poets : he shows an admiration , discriminating and not wholesale , of Mr. Kipling 's verse : he censures Mr. Swinburne , whose Jacobite song ( as he wrote to myself ) did not precisely strike him as the kind of thing that Jacobites used to sing .</p>
   <p>They certainly celebrated</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The perfect health of mind , in these letters of a dying man , is admirable . Reading old letters over , he writes to Miss — -  , ‘ I have known a wonderful number of wonderfully kind-hearted people . ’ That is his criticism of a world which had given him but a scanty welcome , and a life of foiled endeavour , of disappointed hope . Even now there was a disappointment . His poems did not find a publisher : what publisher can take the risk of adding another volume of poetry to the enormous stock of verse brought out at the author 's expense ? This did not sour or sadden him : he took Montaigne 's advice , ‘ not to make too much marvel of our own fortunes . ’ His biographer , hearing in the winter of 1893 that Murray 's illness was now considered hopeless , though its rapid close was not expected , began , with Professor Meiklejohn , to make arrangements for the publication of the poems . But the poet did not live to have this poor gratification . He died in the early hours of 1894 .</p>
   <p>Of the merits of his more serious poetry others must speak . To the Editor it seems that he is always at his best when he is inspired by the Northern Sea , and the long sands and grey sea grasses . Then he is most himself . He was improving in his art with every year : his development , indeed , was somewhat late .</p>
   <p>It is less of the writer than the man that we prefer to think . His letters display , in passages which he would not have desired to see quoted , the depth and tenderness and thoughtfulness of his affections . He must have been a delightful friend : illness could not make him peevish , and his correspondence with old college companions could never be taken for that of a consciously dying man . He had perfect courage , and resolution even in his seeming irresoluteness . He was resolved to be , and continued to be , himself . ‘ He had kept the bird in his bosom . ’ We , who regret him , may wish that he had been granted a longer life , and a secure success . Happier fortunes might have mellowed him , no fortunes could have altered for the worse his admirable nature . He lives in the hearts of his friends , and in the pride and sympathy of those who , after him , have worn and shall wear the scarlet gown .</p>
   <p>The following examples of his poetry were selected by Murray 's biographer from a considerable mass , and have been seen through the press by Professor Meiklejohn , who possesses the original manuscript , beautifully written .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">‘ Twas a stubborn fight , no doubt , and the fortune wheeled about ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the brave Mossoos kept coming most uncomfortable near ,</l>
     <l n="7">And says Wellington the hero , as his hopes went down to zero ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">But Blooker came at length , and we broke Napoleon 's strength ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the flower of his army — that 's the old Imperial Guard —</l>
     <l n="11">They made a final sally , but they found they could not rally ,</l>
     <l n="12">And at last they broke and fled , after fighting bitter hard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Now Napoleon he had thought , when a British ship he sought ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">He was treated very well , as became a noble swell ,</l>

     <l n="19">For we knew he would be making some gigantic undertaking ,</l>
     <l n="20">While the trustful British lion was reposing in his lair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">We tried him once before near the European shore ,</l>
     <l n="22">Having planted him in Elba , where he promised to remain ,</l>
     <l n="23">But when he saw his chance , why , he bolted off to France ,</l>
     <l n="24">And he made a lot of trouble — but it would n't do again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Says the Prince to him , ‘ You know , far away you 'll have to go ,</l>

     <l n="27">Where they tell me that the view of the ocean deep and blue ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">So Napoleon wiped his eye , and he wished the Prince good-bye ,</l>
     <l n="30">And being stony-broke , made the best of it he could ,</l>
     <l n="31">And they kept him snugly pensioned , where his Royal Highness mentioned ,</l>
     <l n="32">And Napoleon Boneyparty is provided for for good .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">Now of that I do n't complain , but I ask and ask in vain ,</l>
     <l n="34">Why me , a British soldier , as has lost a useful arm</l>
     <l n="35">Through fighting of the foe , when the trumpets ceased to blow ,</l>
     <l n="36">Should be forced to feed the pigs on a little Surrey farm ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">While him as fought with us , and created such a fuss ,</l>
     <l n="38">And in the whole of Europe did a mighty deal of harm ,</l>
     <l n="39">Should be kept upon a rock , like a precious fighting cock ,</l>
