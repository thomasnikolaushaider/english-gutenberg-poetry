    <figure>
     <p>JESSAMINE ] Upon the enchanted ladder of his rhymes , Round after round and patiently The poet ever upward climbs . DEDICATION . I need give my verse no hint as to whom it sings for . The rose , knowing her own right , makes servitors of the light-rays to carry her color . So every line here shall in some sense breathe of thee , and in its very face bear record of her whom , however unworthily , it seeks to serve and honor .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O wayward rose , why dost thou wreathe so high ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wasting thyself in sweet-breath 'd ecstasy ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ The pulses of the wind my life uplift ,</l>
     <l n="4">And through my sprays I feel the sunlight sift ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ And all my fibres , in a quick consent</l>
     <l n="6">Entwined , aspire to fill their heavenward bent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">“ I feel the shaking of the far-off sea ,</l>
     <l n="8">And all things growing blend their life with me :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="9">“ When men and women on me look , there glows</l>
     <l n="10">Within my veins a life not of the rose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="11">“ Then let me grow , until I touch the sky ,</l>
     <l n="12">And let me grow and grow until I die ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="13">So , every year , the sweet rose shooteth higher ,</l>
     <l n="14">And scales the roof upon its wings of fire ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="15">And pricks the air , in lovely discontent ,</l>
     <l n="16">With thorns that question still of its intent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="17">But when it reached the roof-tree , there it clung ,</l>
     <l n="18">Nor ever farther up its blossoms flung .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="19">O wayward rose , why hast thou ceased to climb ?</l>
     <l n="20">Hast thou forgot the ardor of thy prime ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="21">“ O hearken ! ” — thus the rose-spray , listening ,—</l>
     <l n="22">“ With what weird music sweet these full hearts ring !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="23">“ What mazy ripples of deep , eddying sound ,</l>
     <l n="24">Rise , touch the roof-tree old , and drift around ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="25">“ Bearing aloft the burden musical</l>
     <l n="26">Of joys and griefs from human hearts that fall !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="27">“ Green stem and fair , flush 'd circle I will lay</l>
     <l n="28">Along the roof , and listen here alway ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="29">“ For rose and tree , and every leafy growth</l>
     <l n="30">That toward the sky unfolds with spiry blowth ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="31">“ No purpose hath save this , to breathe a grace</l>
     <l n="32">O'er men , and in men 's hearts to seek a place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="33">“ Therefore , O poet , thou who gav'st to me</l>
     <l n="34">The homage of thy humble sympathy ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="35">“ No longer vest thy verse in rose-leaves frail :—</l>
     <l n="36">Let the heart 's voice loud through thy pæan wail ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="37">Lo , at my feet the wind of autumn throws</l>
     <l n="38">A hundred turbulent blossoms of the rose ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="39">Full of the voices of the sea and grove</l>
     <l n="40">And air , and full of hidden , murmured love ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="41">And warm with passion through the roof-tree sent ;</l>
     <l n="42">Dew-drenched with tears ;— all in one wild gush spent !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MUSIC OF GROWTH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Music is in all growing things ;</l>
     <l n="2">And underneath the silky wings</l>
     <l n="3">Of smallest insects there is stirred</l>
     <l n="4">A pulse of air that must be heard .</l>
     <l n="5">Earth 's silence lives , and throbs , and sings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">If poet from the vibrant strings</l>
     <l n="7">Of his poor heart a measure flings ,</l>
     <l n="8">Laugh not , that he no trumpet blows :</l>
     <l n="9">It may be that Heaven hears and knows</l>
     <l n="10">His language of low listenings .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>A SONG LONG AGO .</head>
     <l n="1">Through the pauses of thy fervid singing</l>
     <l n="2">Fell crystal sound</l>
     <l n="3">That thy fingers from the keys were flinging</l>
     <l n="4">Lightly around :</l>
     <l n="5">I felt the vine-like harmonies close clinging</l>
     <l n="6">About my soul ;</l>
     <l n="7">And to my eyes , as fruit of their sweet bringing ,</l>
     <l n="8">The full tear stole !</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MELANCHOLY .</head>
     <l n="1">Daughter of my nobler hope</l>
     <l n="2">That dying gave thee birth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sweet Melancholy !</l>
     <l n="4">For memory of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="5">In her dear stead ,</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Bide thou with me ,</l>
     <l n="7">Sweet Melancholy !</l>
     <l n="8">As purple shadows to the tree ,</l>
     <l n="9">When the last sun-rays sadly slope</l>
     <l n="10">Athwart the bare and darkening earth ,</l>
     <l n="11">Art thou to me ,</l>
     <l n="12">Sweet Melancholy !</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CONTENTMENT .</head>
     <l n="1">Glad hours have been when I have seen</l>
     <l n="2">Life 's scope and each dry day 's intent</l>
     <l n="3">United ; so that I could stand</l>
     <l n="4">In silence , covering with my hand</l>
     <l n="5">The circle of the universe ,</l>
     <l n="6">Balance the blessing and the curse ,</l>
     <l n="7">And trust in deeds without chagrin ,</l>
     <l n="8">Free from to-morrow and yesterday — content .</l>

    <p>PART FIRST .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AN APRIL ARIA .</head>
     <l n="1">When the mornings dankly fall</l>
     <l n="2">With a dim forethought of rain ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the robins richly call</l>
     <l n="4">To their mates mercurial ,</l>
     <l n="5">And the tree-boughs creak and strain</l>
     <l n="6">In the wind ;</l>
     <l n="7">When the river 's rough with foam ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the new-made clearings smoke ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the clouds that go and come</l>
     <l n="10">Shine and darken frolicsome ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the frogs at evening croak</l>
     <l n="12">Undefined</l>
     <l n="13">Mysteries of monotone ,</l>
     <l n="14">And by melting beds of snow</l>
     <l n="15">Wind-flowers blossom all alone ;</l>
     <l n="16">Then I know</l>
     <l n="17">That the bitter winter 's dead .</l>
     <l n="18">Over his head</l>
     <l n="19">The damp sod breaks so mellow ,—</l>
     <l n="20">Its mosses tipped with points of yellow ,—</l>
     <l n="21">I cannot but be glad ;</l>
     <l n="22">Yet this sweet mood will borrow</l>
     <l n="23">Something of a sweeter sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="24">To touch and turn me sad .</l>

    <head>THE BOBOLINK .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How sweetly sang the bobolink ,</l>
     <l n="2">When thou , my Love , wast nigh !</l>
     <l n="3">His liquid music from the brink</l>
     <l n="4">Of some cloud-fountain seemed to sink ,</l>
     <l n="5">Built in the blue-domed sky .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">How sadly sings the bobolink !</l>
     <l n="7">No more my Love is nigh :</l>
     <l n="8">Yet rise , my spirit , rise , and drink</l>
     <l n="9">Once more from that cloud-fountain 's brink ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Once more before I die !</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE SUN-SHOWER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A penciled shade the sky doth sweep ,</l>
     <l n="2">And transient glooms creep in to sleep</l>
     <l n="3">Amid the orchard ;</l>
     <l n="4">Fantastic breezes pull the trees</l>
     <l n="5">Hither and yon , to vagaries</l>
     <l n="6">Of aspect tortured .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Then , like the downcast dreamy fringe</l>
     <l n="8">Of eyelids , when dim gates unhinge</l>
     <l n="9">That locked their tears ,</l>
     <l n="10">Falls on the hills a mist of rain ,—</l>
     <l n="11">So faint , it seems to fade again ;</l>
     <l n="12">Yet swiftly nears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Now sparkles the air , all steely-bright ,</l>
     <l n="14">With drops swept down in arrow-flight ,</l>
     <l n="15">Keen , quivering lines .</l>
     <l n="16">Ceased in a breath the showery sound ;</l>
     <l n="17">And teasingly , now , as I look around ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sweet sunlight shines !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Lo , all about the lofty blue are blown</l>
     <l n="2">Light vapors white , like thistle-down ,</l>
     <l n="3">That from their softened silver heaps opaque</l>
     <l n="4">Scatter delicate flake by flake ,</l>
     <l n="5">Upon the wide loom of the heavens weaving</l>
     <l n="6">Forms of fancies past believing ,</l>
     <l n="7">And , with fantastic show of mute despair ,</l>
     <l n="8">As for some sweet hope hurt beyond repair ,</l>
     <l n="9">Melt in the silent voids of sunny air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">All day the cooing brooklet runs in tune :</l>
     <l n="11">Half sunk i ’ th ’ blue , the powdery moon</l>
     <l n="12">Shows whitely . Hark , the bobolink 's note ! I hear it ,</l>
     <l n="13">Far and faint as a fairy spirit !</l>
     <l n="14">Yet all these pass , and as some blithe bird , winging ,</l>
     <l n="15">Leaves a heart-ache for his singing ,</l>
     <l n="16">A frustrate passion haunts me evermore</l>
     <l n="17">For that which closest dwells to beauty 's core .</l>
     <l n="18">O Love , canst thou this heart of hope restore ?</l>

    <head>THE SILENT TIDE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A tangled orchard round the farm-house spreads ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wherein it stands home-like , but desolate ,</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Midst crowded and uneven-statured sheds ,</l>
     <l n="4">Alike by rain and sunshine sadly stained .</l>
     <l n="5">A quiet country-road before the door</l>
     <l n="6">Runs , gathering close its ruts to scale the hill —</l>
     <l n="7">A sudden bluff on the New Hampshire coast ,</l>
     <l n="8">That rises rough against the sea , and hangs</l>
     <l n="9">Crested above the bowlder-sprinkled beach .</l>
     <l n="10">And on the road white houses small are strung</l>
     <l n="11">Like threaded beads , with intervals . The church</l>
     <l n="12">Tops the rough hill ; then comes the wheelwright 's shop .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">From orchard , church , and shop you hear the sea ,</l>

     <l n="16">Sea-like , too , echoing round me here there rolls</l>

     <l n="19">Seeing this place , and telling o'er again</l>
     <l n="20">The tale of those who dwelt here once . Long since</l>
     <l n="21">It was , and they were two — two brothers , bound</l>
     <l n="22">By early orphanage and solitude</l>
     <l n="23">The closer , cleaving strongly each to each ,</l>
     <l n="24">Till love , that held them many years in gage ,</l>
     <l n="25">Itself swept them asunder . I have heard</l>

     <l n="29">And warped with life 's fierce heat and cold : his brows</l>

     <l n="32">Reuben and Jerry they were named ; but two</l>
     <l n="33">Of common blood and nurture scarce were found</l>
     <l n="34">More sharply different . For the first was bold ,</l>
     <l n="35">Breeze-like and bold to come or go ; not rash ,</l>
     <l n="36">But shrewdly generous , popular , and boon :</l>
     <l n="37">And Jerry , dark and sad-faced . Whether least</l>
     <l n="38">He loved himself or neighbor none could tell ,</l>
     <l n="39">So cold he seemed in wonted sympathy .</l>
     <l n="40">Yet he would ponder an hour at a time</l>
     <l n="41">Upon a bird found dead ; and much he loved</l>
     <l n="42">To brood i ’ th ’ shade of yon wind-wavered pines .</l>
     <l n="43">Often at night , too , he would wander forth ,</l>
     <l n="44">Lured by the hollow rumbling of the sea</l>
     <l n="45">In moonlight breaking , there to learn wild things ,</l>
     <l n="46">Such as these dreamers pluck out of the dusk</l>
     <l n="47">While other men lie sleeping . But a star ,</l>
     <l n="48">Rose on his sight , at last , with power to rule</l>
     <l n="49">Majestically mild that deep-domed sky ,</l>
     <l n="50">High as youth 's hopes , that stood above his soul ;</l>
     <l n="51">And , ruling , led him dayward . That was Grace ,</l>
     <l n="52">I mean Grace Brierly , daughter of the squire ,</l>
     <l n="53">Rivaling the wheelwright Hungerford 's shy Ruth</l>
     <l n="54">For beauty . Therefore , in the sunny field ,</l>
     <l n="55">Mowing the clover-purpled grass , or , waked</l>
     <l n="56">In keen December dawns ,— while creeping light</l>
     <l n="57">And winter-tides beneath the pallid stars</l>
     <l n="58">Stole o'er the marsh together ,— a thought of her</l>
     <l n="59">Would turn him cool or warm , like the south breeze ,</l>
     <l n="60">And make him blithe or bitter . Alas for him !</l>
     <l n="61">Eagerly storing golden thoughts of her ,</l>
     <l n="62">He locked a phantom treasure in his breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="63">He sought to chain the breezes , and to lift</l>
     <l n="64">A perfume as a pearl before his eyes —</l>
     <l n="65">Intangible delight ! A time drew on</l>
     <l n="66">When from these twilight musings on his hopes</l>
     <l n="67">He woke , and found the morning of his love</l>
     <l n="68">Blasted , and all its rays shorn suddenly .</l>
     <l n="69">For Reuben , too , had turned his eye on Grace ,</l>
     <l n="70">And she with favoring face the suit had met ,</l>
     <l n="71">Known in the village ; this dream-fettered youth</l>

     <l n="78">Of fair ships , sunlit , braced by buffeting winds ,</l>
     <l n="79">Indomitably brave ; but , soon or late ,</l>
     <l n="80">Battle and hurricane or whirl them deep</l>
     <l n="81">Below to death , or send them homeward , seared</l>
     <l n="82">By shot and storm : so went they forth , that day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="83">Two wagons full of rosy children rolled</l>

     <l n="86">On grassy table-land , warm with the sun</l>
     <l n="87">And yielding tributary odors wild</l>
     <l n="88">Of strawberry , late June-rose , juniper ,</l>
     <l n="89">Where sea and land breeze mingled . There a brook</l>
     <l n="90">Through a bare hollow flashing , spurted , purled ,</l>
     <l n="91">And shot away , yet stayed — a light and grace</l>
     <l n="92">Unconscious and unceasing . And thick pines ,</l>
     <l n="93">Hard by , drew darkly far away their dim</l>
     <l n="94">And sheltering , cool arcades . So all dismount ,</l>
     <l n="95">And fields and forest gladden with their shout ;</l>
     <l n="96">Ball , swing , and see-saw sending the light hearts</l>
     <l n="97">Of the children high o'er earth and everything .</l>
     <l n="98">While some staid , kindly women draw and spread</l>
     <l n="99">In pine-shade the long whiteness of a cloth ,</l>
     <l n="100">The rest , a busy legion , o'er the grass</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="102">O laughing Fate ! O treachery of truth</l>
     <l n="103">To royal hopes youth bows before ! That day ,</l>
     <l n="104">Ev'n there where life in such glad measure beat</l>
     <l n="105">Its round , with winds and waters , tunefully ,</l>
     <l n="106">And birds made music in the matted wood ,</l>
     <l n="107">The shaft of death reached Jerry 's heart : he saw</l>
     <l n="108">The sweet conspiracy of those two lives ,</l>
     <l n="109">In looks and gestures read his doom , and heard</l>
     <l n="110">Their laughter ring to the grave all mirth of his .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="111">So Reuben 's life in full leaf stood , its fruit</l>
     <l n="112">Hidden in a green expectancy ; but all</l>
     <l n="113">His days were rounded with ripe consciousness :</l>
     <l n="114">While Jerry felt the winter 's whitening blight ,</l>
     <l n="115">As when that frosty fern-work and those palms</l>
     <l n="116">Of visionary leaf , and trailing vines ,</l>
     <l n="117">Quaint-chased by night-winds on the pane , melt off ,</l>
     <l n="118">And naked earth , stone-stiff , with bristling trees ,</l>
     <l n="119">Stares in the winter sunlight coldly through .</l>
     <l n="120">But yet he rose , and clothed himself amain</l>
     <l n="121">With misery , and once more put on life</l>
     <l n="122">As a stained garment . Highly he resolved</l>
     <l n="123">To make his deedless days henceforward strike</l>
     <l n="124">Pure harmony — a psalm of silences .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="125">But on the Sunday , coming from the church ,</l>
     <l n="126">He saw those happy , plighted lovers walk</l>
     <l n="127">Before proud Grace 's father , and of friends</l>
     <l n="128">Heard comment and congratulation given .</l>
     <l n="129">Then with Rob Snow he hurried to the beach ,</l>
     <l n="130">To a rough heap of stones they two had reared</l>
     <l n="131">In boyhood . There the two held sad debate</l>
     <l n="132">Of life 's swift losses , Bob inspiriting still ,</l>
     <l n="133">Jerry rejecting hope , ev'n though his friend ,</l>
     <l n="134">Self-wounding ( for he loved Ruth Hungerford ) ,</l>
     <l n="135">Told how the wheelwright 's daughter longed for him ,</l>
     <l n="136">And yet might make him glad , though Grace was lost .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="137">The season deepened , and in Jerry 's heart</l>
     <l n="138">Ripened a thought charged with grave consequence .</l>
     <l n="139">His grief he would have stifled at its birth ,</l>
     <l n="140">Sad child of frustrate longing ! But anon —</l>
     <l n="141">Knowledge of Ruth 's affection being revealed ,</l>
     <l n="142">Which , if he stayed to let it feed on him ,</l>
     <l n="143">Vine-like might wreathe and wind about his life ,</l>
     <l n="144">Lifting all shade and sweetness out of reach</l>
     <l n="145">Of Robert , so long his friend — honor , and hopes</l>
     <l n="146">He would not name , kindled a torch for war</l>
     <l n="147">Of various impulse in him . Reuben wedded ;</l>
     <l n="148">Yet Jerry lingered . Then , swift whisperings</l>
     <l n="149">Along reverberant walls of gossips ’ ears</l>
     <l n="150">Hummed loud and louder a love for Ruth . Grace , too ,</l>
     <l n="151">Involved him in a web of soft surmise</l>
     <l n="152">With Ruth ; and Reuben questioned him thereof .</l>
     <l n="153">But a white , sudden anger struck like a bolt</l>
     <l n="154">O'er Jerry 's face , that blackened under it :</l>
     <l n="155">He strode away , and left his brother dazed ,</l>
     <l n="156">With red rush of offended self-conceit</l>
     <l n="157">Staining his forehead to the hair . This flash</l>
     <l n="158">Of anger — first since boyhood 's wholesome strifes —</l>
     <l n="159">On Jerry 's path gleamed lurid ; by its light</l>
     <l n="160">He shaped a life 's course out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="161">There came a storm</l>
     <l n="162">One night . He bade farewell to Ruth ; and when</l>
     <l n="163">Above the seas the bare-browed dawn arose ,</l>
     <l n="164">While the last laggard drops ran off the eaves ,</l>
     <l n="165">He dressed , but took some customary garb</l>
     <l n="166">On his arm ; stole swiftly to the sands ; and there</l>
     <l n="167">Cast clown his garments by the ancient heap</l>
     <l n="168">Of stones . At first brief pause he made , and thought :</l>
     <l n="169">“ And thus I play , to win perchance a tear</l>
     <l n="170">From her whom , first , to save the smallest care ,</l>
     <l n="171">I thought I could have died ! ” But then at once</l>
     <l n="172">Within the sweep of swirling water-planes</l>
     <l n="173">That from the great waves circled up and slid</l>
     <l n="174">Instantly back , passing far down the shore ,</l>
     <l n="175">Southward he made his way . Next day he shipped</l>
     <l n="176">Upon a whaler outward bound . She spread</l>
     <l n="177">Her mighty wings , and bore him far away —</l>
     <l n="178">So far , Death seemed across her wake to stalk ,</l>
     <l n="179">Withering her swift shape from the empty air ,</l>
     <l n="180">Until her memory grew a faded dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="181">Ah , what a desolate brightness that young day</l>
     <l n="182">Flung o'er the impassive strand and dull green marsh</l>
     <l n="183">And green-arched orchard , ere it struck the farm !</l>
     <l n="184">Storm-strengthened , clear , and cool the morning rose</l>
     <l n="185">To gaze down on that frighted home , where dawned</l>
     <l n="186">Pale Ruth 's discovery of her loss , who late ,</l>
     <l n="187">Guessing some ill in Jerry 's last-night words</l>
     <l n="188">Of vague farewell , woke now to certainty</l>
     <l n="189">Of strange disaster . So , when Reuben and Rob ,</l>
     <l n="190">Hither and thither searching , with locked lips</l>
     <l n="191">And eyes grown suddenly cold in eager dread ,</l>
     <l n="192">On those still sands beside the untamed sea ,</l>
     <l n="193">Came to the garments Jerry had thrown there , dumb</l>
     <l n="194">They stood , and knew he 'd perished . If by chance</l>
     <l n="195">Borne out with undertow and rolled beneath</l>
     <l n="196">The gaping surge , or rushing on his death</l>
     <l n="197">Free-willed , they would not guess ; but straight they set</l>
     <l n="198">Themselves to watch the changes of the sea —</l>
     <l n="199">The watchful sea that would not be betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="200">The surly flood that echoed their suspense</l>
     <l n="201">With hollow-sounding horror . Thus three tides</l>
     <l n="202">Hurled on the beach their empty spray , and brought</l>
     <l n="203">Nor doubt-dispelling death , nor new-born hope .</l>
     <l n="204">But with the fourth slow turn at length there came</l>
     <l n="205">A naked , drifting body impelled to shore ,</l>

     <l n="208">And him , disfigured by the water 's wear ,</l>
     <l n="209">The watching friends supposed their dead ; and so ,</l>
     <l n="210">Mourning , took up this outcast of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="211">And buried him , with church-rite and with pall</l>
     <l n="212">Trailing , and train of sad-eyed mourners , there</l>

     <l n="218">Rob Snow , he venturing from time to time</l>
     <l n="219">Some small , uncertain act of kindliness .</l>
     <l n="220">Long seemed she vowed from joy , but when the birds</l>
     <l n="221">Began to mate , and quiet violets blow</l>
     <l n="222">Along the brook-side , lo ! she smiled again ;</l>
     <l n="223">Again the wind-flower color in her cheeks</l>
     <l n="224">Blanch 'd in a breath , and bloomed once more ; then stayed ;</l>
     <l n="225">Till , like the breeze that rumors ripening buds ,</l>
     <l n="226">A delicate sense crept through the air that soon</l>
     <l n="227">These two would scale the church-crowned hill , and wed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="228">The seasons faced the world , and fled , and came .</l>
     <l n="229">In summer nights , the soft roll of the sea</l>
     <l n="230">Was shattered , resonant , beneath a moon</l>
     <l n="231">That , silent , seemed to hearken . And every hour</l>
     <l n="232">In autumn , night or day , large apples fell</l>
     <l n="233">Without rebound to earth , upon the sod</l>
     <l n="234">There mounded greenly by the large slate slab</l>
     <l n="235">In the old orchard-lot near Reuben 's door .</l>
     <l n="236">But there were changes : after some long years</l>
     <l n="237">Reuben and Grace beheld a brave young boy</l>
     <l n="238">Bearing their double life abroad in one —</l>
     <l n="239">Beginning new the world , and bringing hopes</l>
     <l n="240">That in their path fell flower-like . Not at ease</l>
     <l n="241">They dwelt , though ; for a slow discordancy</l>
     <l n="242">Of temper — weak-willed waste of life in bursts</l>
     <l n="243">Of petulance — had marred their happiness .</l>
     <l n="244">And so the boy , young Reuben , as he grew ,</l>
     <l n="245">Was chafed and vexed by this ill-fitting mode</l>
     <l n="246">Of life forced on him , and rebelled . Too oft</l>
     <l n="247">Brooding alone , he shaped loose schemes of flight</l>
     <l n="248">Into the joyous outer world , to break</l>
     <l n="249">From the unwholesome wranglings of his home .</l>
     <l n="250">Then once , when at some slight demur he made ,</l>
     <l n="251">Dispute ensued between the man and wife ,</l>
     <l n="252">He burst forth , goaded , “ Some day I will leave —</l>
     <l n="253">Leave you forever ! ” And his father stared ,</l>
     <l n="254">Lifted and clenched his hand , but let it unloose ,</l>
     <l n="255">Nerveless . The blow , unstruck , yet quivered through</l>
     <l n="256">The boy 's whole body .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="257">Waiting for the night ,</l>
     <l n="258">Reuben made ready , lifted latch , went forth ;</l>
     <l n="259">Then , with his little bundle in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="260">Took the bleak road that led him to the world .</l>
     <l n="261">When Jerry eighteen years had sailed , had bared</l>
     <l n="262">His hurt soul to the pitiless sun and drunk</l>
     <l n="263">The rainy brew of storms on all seas , tired</l>
     <l n="264">Of wreck and fever and renewed mischance</l>
     <l n="265">That would not end in death , a longing stirred</l>
     <l n="266">Within him to revisit that gray coast</l>
     <l n="267">Where he was born . He landed at the port</l>
     <l n="268">Whence first he sailed ; and , as in fervid youth ,</l>
     <l n="269">Set forth upon the highway , to walk home .</l>
     <l n="270">Some hoarding he had made , wherewith to enrich</l>
     <l n="271">His brother 's brood for spendthrift purposes ;</l>
     <l n="272">And as he walked he wondered how they looked ,</l>
     <l n="273">How tall they were , how many there might be .</l>
     <l n="274">At noon he set himself beside the way ,</l>
     <l n="275">Under a clump of willows sprouting dense</l>
     <l n="276">O'er the weed-woven margin of a brook ;</l>
     <l n="277">While in the fine green branches overhead</l>
     <l n="278">Song-sparrows lightly perched , for whom he threw</l>
     <l n="279">From his scant bread some crumbs , remembering well</l>
     <l n="280">Old days when he had played with birds like these —</l>
     <l n="281">The same , perhaps , or grandfathers of theirs ,</l>
     <l n="282">Or earlier still progenitors : whereat</l>
     <l n="283">They chirped and chattered louder than before .</l>
     <l n="284">But , as he sat , a boy came down the road ,</l>
     <l n="285">Stirring the noontide dust with laggard feet .</l>
     <l n="286">Young Reuben ‘ t was , who seaward made his way .</l>
     <l n="287">And Jerry hailed him , carelessly , his mood</l>
     <l n="288">Moving to salutation , and the boy ,</l>
     <l n="289">From under his torn hat-brim looking , answered .</l>
     <l n="290">Then , seeing that he eyed his scrap of bread ,</l>
     <l n="291">The sailor bade him come and share it . So</l>
     <l n="292">They fell to talk ; and Jerry , with a rough ,</l>
     <l n="293">Quick-touching kindness , the boy 's heart so moved</l>
     <l n="294">That unto him he all his wrong confessed .</l>
     <l n="295">Gravely the sailor looked at him , and told</l>
     <l n="296">His own tale of mad flight and wandering ; how ,</l>
     <l n="297">Wasted he had come back , his life a husk</l>
     <l n="298">Of withered seeds , a raveled purse , though once</l>
     <l n="299">With golden years well stocked , all squandered now .</l>
     <l n="300">At ending , he prevailed , and Reub was won</l>
     <l n="301">To turn and follow . Jerry , though he knew</l>
     <l n="302">Not yet the father 's name , said he that way</l>
     <l n="303">Was going , too , and he would intercede</l>
     <l n="304">Between the truant and his father . Back</l>
     <l n="305">Together then they went . But on the way ,</l>
     <l n="306">As now they passed from pines to farming-land ,</l>
     <l n="307">The boy asked more . “ ‘ T is queer you should have come</l>
     <l n="308">From these same parts , and run away like me !</l>
     <l n="309">You did not tell me how it happened . ”</l>

     <l n="1">Foolish ,</l>
     <l n="2">All of it ! But I thought it weightier</l>

     <l n="1">I do n't know . Long ago ; it 's like a dream</l>
     <l n="2">To me . I was not born then . Deacon Snow</l>
     <l n="3">Has told me something of it . Mother cries</l>

     <l n="1">I am confused</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">A strange uneasiness</l>
     <l n="5">In Jerry 's breast had waked . They walked awhile</l>
     <l n="6">In silence . This he could not well believe ,</l>
     <l n="7">That Grace and Reuben unhappy were , nor that</l>
     <l n="8">One son alone was theirs . Therefore aside</l>
     <l n="9">He thrust that hidden , sharp foreboding : still</l>
     <l n="10">He trusted , still sustained a calm suspense ,</l>
     <l n="11">And ranged among his memories . “ Tell me , son , ”</l>
     <l n="12">He said , “ about this Deacon Snow — Rob Snow</l>
     <l n="13">It must be , I suppose . ”</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="2">A jolly blade , if ever any was ,</l>
     <l n="3">And merry as the full moon .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE BOY .</head>
     <l n="1">He has failed</l>
     <l n="2">A good deal now , though , since his wife died .</l>

     <l n="1">Why ,</l>
     <l n="2">How long you must have been away ! For since</l>
     <l n="3">I can remember he has had a wife</l>
     <l n="4">And children . She was Gran'ther Hungerford 's —</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>JERRY .</head>
     <l n="1">Her name was Ruth ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Yes , Ruth ! ‘ T is after her</l>
     <l n="2">The deacon 's nicest daughter 's named ; she 's Ruth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Then sadly Jerry pondered , and no more</l>
     <l n="4">Found speech . They tramped on sternly . To the brow</l>
     <l n="5">Of a long hill they came , whence they could see</l>
     <l n="6">The village and blue ocean ; then they sank</l>
     <l n="7">Into a region of low-lying fields</l>
     <l n="8">Half-naked from the scythe , and others veined</l>
     <l n="9">With vines that ‘ midst dismantled , fallen corn</l>
     <l n="10">Dragged all athwart a weight of tawny gourds ,</l>
     <l n="11">Sun-mellowed , sound . And now the level way</l>
     <l n="12">Stretched forward eagerly , for hard ahead</l>
     <l n="13">It made the turn that rounded Reuben 's house .</l>
     <l n="14">Between the still road and the tossing sea</l>
     <l n="15">Lay the wide swamp , with all its hundred pools</l>
     <l n="16">Reflecting leaden light ; anon they passed</l>
     <l n="17">A farm-yard where the noisy chanticleer</l>
     <l n="18">Strutted and ruled , as one long since had done ;</l>
     <l n="19">And then the wayside trough with jutting spout</l>
     <l n="20">Of ancient , mossy wood , that still poured forth</l>
     <l n="21">Its liquid largess to all comers . Soon</l>
     <l n="22">A slow cart met them , filled with gathered kelp :</l>
     <l n="23">The salt scent seemed a breath of younger days .</l>
     <l n="24">They reached the road-bend , and the evening shone</l>
     <l n="25">Upon them , calmly . Jerry paused , o'erwhelmed .</l>
     <l n="26">Reuben , surprised , glanced at him , and then said ,</l>
     <l n="27">“ Yonder 's the house . ” Old Jerry gazed on him ,</l>
     <l n="28">And trembled ; for before him slowly grew</l>
     <l n="29">Through the boy 's face the mingled features there</l>
     <l n="30">Of father and of mother — Grace 's mouth ,</l>
     <l n="31">Ripe , pouting lips , and Reuben 's square-framed eyes .</l>
     <l n="32">But , mastering well his voice , he bade the boy</l>
     <l n="33">Wait by the wall , till he a little while</l>
     <l n="34">Went forward , and prepared . So Reuben stayed ;</l>
     <l n="35">And Jerry with uncertain step advanced ,</l>
     <l n="36">As dreaming of his youth and this his home .</l>
     <l n="37">Slowly he passed between the gateless posts</l>
     <l n="38">Before the unused front door , slowly too</l>
     <l n="39">Beyond the side porch with its woodbine thick</l>
     <l n="40">Draping autumnal splendor . Thus he came</l>
     <l n="41">Before the kitchen window , where he saw</l>
     <l n="42">A gray-haired woman bent o'er needle-work</l>
     <l n="43">In gathering twilight . And without a voice ,</l>
     <l n="44">Rooted , he stood . He stirred not , but his glance</l>
     <l n="45">Burned through the pane ; uneasily she turned ,</l>
     <l n="46">And seeing that shaggy stranger standing there</l>
     <l n="47">Expectant , shook her head , as though to warn</l>
     <l n="48">Some chance , wayfaring beggar . He , though , stood</l>
     <l n="49">And looked at her immovably . Then , quick</l>
     <l n="50">The sash upthrowing , she made as if to speak</l>
     <l n="51">Harshly ; but still he held his quiet eyes</l>
     <l n="52">Upon her . Now she paused ; her throat throbbed full ;</l>
     <l n="53">Her lips paled suddenly , her wan face flamed ,</l>
     <l n="54">A fertile stir of memory strove to work</l>
     <l n="55">Renewal in those features wintry cold .</l>
     <l n="56">And so she hung , while Jerry by a step</l>
     <l n="57">Drawn nearer , coming just beneath her , said ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ Grace ! ” And she murmured , “ Jerry ! ” Then she bent</l>
     <l n="59">Over him , clasping his great matted head</l>
     <l n="60">With those worn arms , all joyless ; and the tears</l>
     <l n="61">Fell hot upon his forehead from her eyes .</l>
     <l n="62">For now in this dim gloaming their two souls</l>
     <l n="63">Unfruited , by an instant insight wild ,</l>
     <l n="64">Delicious , found the full , mysterious clew</l>
     <l n="65">Of individual being , each in each .</l>
     <l n="66">But , tremulously , soon they drew themselves</l>
     <l n="67">Away from that so sweet , so sad embrace ,</l>
     <l n="68">The first , the last that could be theirs . Then he ,</l>
     <l n="69">Summing his story in a word , a glance ,</l>
     <l n="70">Added , “ But though you see me broken down</l>
     <l n="71">And poor enough , not empty-handed quite</l>
     <l n="72">I come . For God set in my way a gift ,</l>
     <l n="73">The best I could have sought . I bring it you</l>
     <l n="74">In memory of the love I bore . Not now</l>
     <l n="75">Must that again be thought of ! Waste and black</l>
     <l n="76">My life 's fields lie behind me , and a frost</l>
     <l n="77">Has stilled the music of my hopes , but here</l>
     <l n="78">If I may dwell , nor trouble you , such a joy</l>
     <l n="79">Were mine , I dare not ask it . Oh forgive</l>
     <l n="80">The weakness ! Come and see my gift ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="81">Ah , tears</l>
     <l n="82">Flowed fast , that night , from springs of love unsealed</l>
     <l n="83">Once more within the ancient house — rare tears</l>
     <l n="84">Of reconciliation , grief , and joy !</l>
     <l n="85">A miracle , it seemed , had here been wrought ,</l>
     <l n="86">The dead brought back to life . And with him came</l>
     <l n="87">The prodigal , repenting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="88">So , thenceforth ,</l>
     <l n="89">A spirit of peace within the household dwelt .</l>
     <l n="90">In Jerry a swift-sent age these years had brought ,</l>
     <l n="91">To soften him , wrought with all the woe at home</l>
     <l n="92">Such open , gracious dignity , that all</l>
     <l n="93">For cheer and guidance learned to look to him .</l>
     <l n="94">But chiefly th ’ younger Reuben sought his aid ,</l>
     <l n="95">And he with homely wisdom shaped the lad</l>
     <l n="96">To a life 's loving duty . Yet not long ,</l>
     <l n="97">Alas ! the kind sea-farer with them stayed .</l>
     <l n="98">After some years his storm-racked body drooped .</l>
     <l n="99">The season came when crickets cease to sing</l>
     <l n="100">And flame-curled leaves fly fast ; and Jerry sank</l>
     <l n="101">Softly toward death . Then , on a boisterous morn</l>
     <l n="102">That beat the wrecked woods with incessant gusts</l>
     <l n="103">To wrest some last leaf from them , he arose</l>
     <l n="104">And passed away . But those who loved him watched</l>
     <l n="105">His fading , half in doubt , and half afraid ,</l>
     <l n="106">As if he must return again ; for now</l>
     <l n="107">Entering the past he seemed , and not a life</l>
     <l n="108">Beyond ; and some who thought of that old grave</l>
     <l n="109">In the orchard , dreamed a breath 's space that the man</l>
     <l n="110">Long buried had come back , and could not die .</l>
     <l n="111">But so he died , and , ceasing , made request</l>
     <l n="112">Beside that outcast of the deep to lie .</l>
     <l n="113">None other mark desired he but the stone</l>
     <l n="114">Set there long since , though at a stranger 's grave ,</l>
     <l n="115">In heavy memory of him thought dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="116">They marked the earth with one more mound beside</l>
     <l n="117">The other , near a gap in the low wall</l>
     <l n="118">That looked out seaward . There you ever hear</l>
     <l n="119">The deep , remorseful requiem of the sea ;</l>
     <l n="120">And there , in autumn , windfalls , showering thick</l>
     <l n="121">Upon the grave , score the slow , voiceless hours</l>
     <l n="122">With unrebounding stroke . All round about</l>
     <l n="123">Green milkweed rankly thrives , and golden-rod</l>
     <l n="124">Sprouts from his prostrate heart in fine-poised grace</l>
     <l n="125">Of haughty curve , with every crest in flower .</l>
