    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Somnolent , vast , inert , the darkness lay</l>
     <l n="3">Waiting for dawn . Across the ocean stirred</l>
     <l n="4">A luminous haze , not light , but whispering light ,</l>
     <l n="5">So softly yet , the islands had not heard .</l>
     <l n="6">The mystery of sleep was in the trees</l>
     <l n="7">And on the weary stars . A little cry</l>
     <l n="8">That broke the silence seemed a sacrilege .</l>
     <l n="9">Then thro ’ the palm trees glided like a ghost</l>
     <l n="10">A dusky form ; the curtain of the dark</l>
     <l n="11">Was rent with life , the forest brought forth men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">Instinct with morning every eye was bright ,</l>
     <l n="13">Tho ’ sleep so lately lay across their lids .</l>
     <l n="14">No sinister intent had called them forth</l>
     <l n="15">Upon the shadows . May held out her hands ,</l>
     <l n="16">And all the men who dared the dangerous sport</l>
     <l n="17">Were faring where the great bonita played ,—</l>
     <l n="18">Strong shining fish below the mid sea waves .</l>
     <l n="19">Upon the beach beneath the paling moon</l>
     <l n="20">The boats were launched . Amid the busy stir</l>
     <l n="21">One man stood idle ; as a chief might order ,</l>
     <l n="22">He bade the youths prepare his long canoe .</l>
     <l n="23">With folded arms he gravely watched the rest</l>
     <l n="24">And gave them salutation haughtily .</l>
     <l n="25">Uhila<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>was he called , and in his veins</l>
     <l n="26">There ran a slender stream of northern blood .</l>
     <l n="27">He bore upon his old and indolent heart ,</l>
     <l n="28">Scarred with the sins of war , a white device .</l>
     <l n="29">Taka , daughter of chiefs and Fiji 's pride ,</l>
     <l n="30">Lily of maidens , was betrothed to him ;</l>
     <l n="31">Desirous eyes kinged him with envy 's crown .</l>
    </lg>

   <note xml:id="note1" place="bottom" n="1">The lightning .</note>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Scraping across the beach the boats were launched ,</l>
     <l n="2">And as they touched the waves , they seemed to take</l>
     <l n="3">New shape and dignity with that caress</l>
     <l n="4">Of little lapping ripples round the prow .</l>
     <l n="5">Uhila led the fleet as one who knew</l>
     <l n="6">His right by reason of his age and skill .</l>
     <l n="7">The little isle seemed now a sleeping maid</l>
     <l n="8">Kirtled in green , the beach her snowy breast</l>
     <l n="9">Veined with the purple brooks that sought the sea .</l>
     <l n="10">Uhila watched it fade below the blue ,</l>
     <l n="11">Crouched in the bow , his grizzled chin in hand ,</l>
     <l n="12">Taking his ease , while small Kuma , keen-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="13">Famed for his daring , paddled lustily .</l>
     <l n="14">The dawn had not yet broken , and the soft</l>
     <l n="15">Beautiful haze that veils the birth of day</l>
     <l n="16">Hung on the water . Loath to break the peace ,</l>
     <l n="17">Men gave their orders in hushed tones , the clean</l>
     <l n="18">Chill of the morning wrapt their naked bodies .</l>
     <l n="19">Then , as a slow blush mounts the cheek , a light</l>
     <l n="20">Breathed from the sea , and all the air seemed warm</l>
     <l n="21">As at the touch of spring , a violet streak ,</l>
     <l n="22">A pale leaf green , a golden , and a rose</l>
     <l n="23">Broke in the sky , and morning was revealed .</l>
     <l n="24">With a shrill cry , young Kuma raised his hand</l>
     <l n="25">And pointed where with dip and shriek and wheel</l>
     <l n="26">A flock of sea birds hovered ; all the rest</l>
     <l n="27">Echoed the call and bending to the paddle</l>
     <l n="28">Shot o'er the waves , for now the fish were gained .</l>
     <l n="29">Uhila grasped his rod , and at the stern</l>
     <l n="30">Tossed out the shining hook , with laugh and cheer</l>
     <l n="31">A glint of silver flashed , then all the air</l>
     <l n="32">Was gemmed with streaming stars . They came from deeps ;</l>
     <l n="33">From azure fairer than its mother sky</l>
     <l n="34">Clouded with dazzling whitenesses of foam .</l>
     <l n="35">Luck to their fishing :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="36">Now , fair and remote</l>
     <l n="37">A scattered emerald from a broken chain</l>
     <l n="38">Lying below the bending breast of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="39">The village had awakened ,— once again</l>
     <l n="40">Serene Kambara , island of the south ,</l>
     <l n="41">Exhaled its light upon the light of heaven .</l>
     <l n="42">The verdure seemed to shine with lucent green ,</l>
     <l n="43">The red hibiscus burned with inward flame ,</l>
     <l n="44">And in the village happy song and shout</l>
     <l n="45">Proclaimed the day was fair . Blue upon blue</l>
     <l n="46">The bright waves glittered like a shattered star</l>
     <l n="47">Set in the silver crescent of the sand .</l>
     <l n="48">The palm trees ’ plume uplifted dauntlessly</l>
     <l n="49">To call the morning . At the forest 's brim</l>
     <l n="50">The day was made alive by human flowers ,</l>
     <l n="51">Sweet maidens who against the emerald</l>
     <l n="52">Showed warm and brown in purest harmony .</l>
     <l n="53">The fierce bright flame that is the tropic sea</l>
     <l n="54">Burned on their eyes and called them to its heart .</l>
     <l n="55">Like eager sea birds they forgot the land ,</l>
     <l n="56">And , happy as the amorous waves , they gave</l>
     <l n="57">Their slim brown bodies to the sea 's embrace .</l>
     <l n="58">They found them driftwood and astride they leapt</l>
     <l n="59">The feathered breakers , one with daring skill</l>
     <l n="60">Curved her sweet length to lie within the palm</l>
     <l n="61">Of a strong wave , and so was brought to shore .</l>
     <l n="62">“ Taka , ” they cried , “ has beaten us ; ” and all ,</l>
     <l n="63">Shaking the bright drops from their shining hair ,</l>
     <l n="64">With laugh and song sprang to the beach again ,</l>
     <l n="65">Sunning themselves to languor ere they made</l>
     <l n="66">Their pretty toilet .</l>
     <l n="67">Some had gathered flowers</l>
     <l n="68">In fragrant wreaths , and others brought the grave</l>
     <l n="69">Work of the morning . Yet because the wine —</l>
     <l n="70">Sun of the South — gilds even toil , it seemed</l>
     <l n="71">A poet 's pastime . Scarlet beans they threaded</l>
     <l n="72">Later to lie about some golden throat .</l>
     <l n="73">Deftly they wove fine mats , and deftly twisted</l>
     <l n="74">Bright witchery to adorn themselves , and snare</l>
     <l n="75">Men 's eyes . With little songs they pearled the air .</l>
     <l n="76">Hush ! it is Taka singing :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="77">“ Far away</l>
     <l n="78">In a fountain dwelt a maiden ;</l>
     <l n="79">When the silver moon was high</l>
     <l n="80">She was glad , but heavy laden</l>
     <l n="81">Was she when its light must die .</l>
     <l n="82">Far away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="83">“ Far away</l>

     <l n="85">Loved her when the moon was high ;</l>
     <l n="86">When the moon was pale above her</l>
     <l n="87">Love grew pale and like to die</l>
     <l n="88">Far away .</l>

     <l n="89">“ Far away</l>

     <l n="91">Happy while the moon was high ,</l>
     <l n="92">Waning , fled she , her pursuer</l>
     <l n="93">Held her back , and saw her die</l>
     <l n="94">Far away . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="95">“ ‘ Tis a sad song for morning , ” cried the maids —</l>
     <l n="96">“ And for a bride . Come , Hopa , sing of laughter . ”</l>
     <l n="97">Hopa sang :—</l>

     <l n="109">Little brown maidens ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="110">Afar there sounded in the mellow breeze</l>
     <l n="111">The rhythmic movement of the maidens ’ toil ;</l>
     <l n="112">Before them on the sand a snowy sheet</l>
     <l n="113">Lay spread ,— the tapa cloth ; tutunga trees</l>
     <l n="114">Yield them their inner bark , and lightly then</l>
     <l n="115">The maidens tap the fibres till they join ,</l>
     <l n="116">Made firm with scented gums and bright with dyes ,</l>
     <l n="117">To form a fabric that a bride might choose ,</l>
     <l n="118">And this was for a bride . Among the rest</l>
     <l n="119">One maiden shone ; a moon beside her stars ,</l>
     <l n="120">Taka , the fair . Her father was the chief</l>
     <l n="121">Of this small village . His the splendid store</l>
     <l n="122">Of kava bowls for which the isle is famed ,</l>
     <l n="123">The shining fish-hooks , fairest of mother of pearl ,</l>
     <l n="124">Great mats from ancient days with border rare</l>
     <l n="125">Of crimson feathers , cruel tragic spears ,</l>
     <l n="126">Sweet unguents , necklaces of pearly shells</l>
     <l n="127">Envied by maidens , and above them all</l>
     <l n="128">Bales of the snowy tapa , made by hands</l>
     <l n="129">Subtle , wise hands of women , over whom</l>
     <l n="130">The earth had long laid flowers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="131">In the land</l>
     <l n="132">Where history is but a charming tale</l>
     <l n="133">Droned by old men at twilight , future days</l>
     <l n="134">Pleasantly certain as the next repast ,</l>
     <l n="135">Where gods and goddesses appear as birds ,</l>
     <l n="136">Trees , plants or moonlight , gently rising tide ,</l>
     <l n="137">And shining girdle of leaves ,— all homely things ,</l>
     <l n="138">Which hold the people 's hearts .— In this fair land</l>
     <l n="139">Taka was born . Thro ’ sixteen years of moon</l>
     <l n="140">And tropic sun she blossomed in the air .</l>
     <l n="141">Chilled by no frost , the world unconsciously</l>
     <l n="142">Mirrored her sweetness back to her . The sun</l>
     <l n="143">Had kissed her skin to a warm topaz ; rare</l>
     <l n="144">As dusky wealth of Autumn , her sweet breast ,</l>
     <l n="145">Gleaming and bare , was hung with ropes of flowers</l>
     <l n="146">Yellow and white , and in her curling hair</l>
     <l n="147">Glimmered the pure gardenia . All the braves</l>
     <l n="148">Wished her for wife , but old Akau the chief ,</l>
     <l n="149">Knowing Uhila 's prowess and the blood</l>
     <l n="150">Left by an English forbear in his veins ,</l>
     <l n="151">Knowing that Taka too could boast , or mourn ,</l>
     <l n="152">A foreign ancestry , had lately pledged</l>
     <l n="153">His daughter to this brave , and now the village</l>
     <l n="154">Made preparations for the marriage . There</l>
     <l n="155">By the warm sea the maidens paid their court</l>
     <l n="156">To Taka , who so soon would leave their gay</l>
     <l n="157">Indifferent frolic lives to wed the grave</l>
     <l n="158">Stern chief . She did not falter at the choice .</l>
     <l n="159">Love which the maidens sang was but a word ;</l>
     <l n="160">She wished no better fate than to be mated</l>
     <l n="161">To a strong warrior whom her heart held dear</l>
     <l n="162">As friend to kind Akau . So she waited .</l>
     <l n="163">In her slim hands she held a polished cup ,</l>
     <l n="164">The shell of cocoanut , which caught the light</l>
     <l n="165">Like a brown pool . The toil of many days</l>
     <l n="166">Had turned the tawny shade to warmest black</l>
     <l n="167">In gradual depths as shaded Taka 's cheek ;</l>
     <l n="168">With perfumed oil her fingers gave caress</l>
     <l n="169">And waked the hidden pictures in the grain ,</l>
     <l n="170">The yellow sand , the dusky amber girl ,</l>
     <l n="171">The brown perfected in the shining globe .</l>
     <l n="172">Earth 's monotones are justified in this .</l>
     <l n="173">Close to her lolled small Hopa , blithe and gay</l>
     <l n="174">As a young cricket , teasing all the rest</l>
     <l n="175">With her sharp wit ; often she dropped her work —</l>
     <l n="176">The threading of bright flowers into wreaths —</l>
     <l n="177">To look across the waves , and suddenly</l>
     <l n="178">She called , “ A sail , a little sail , ” and all</l>
     <l n="179">Followed her pointing fingers . Far away ,</l>
     <l n="180">Tossed like a feather , black against the sky ,</l>
     <l n="181">Hovered a tiny craft , its unknown lines</l>
     <l n="182">Marked it as stranger , and the maidens all</l>
     <l n="183">Curiously watched its coming to the shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="184">All night the little shell with ceaseless dip</l>
     <l n="185">And pause , and rise and dip again , had borne</l>
     <l n="186">The trackless trade winds . Tui Tua Kau ,</l>
     <l n="187">“ King of the Reefs , ” had ventured over far</l>
     <l n="188">From Tonga 's shore . Caught by a wanton gale ,</l>
     <l n="189">His idle racing , lengthened in a whim</l>
     <l n="190">To cheat his laughing mates , grew a wild flight .</l>
     <l n="191">The frail canoe seemed , on the angry sea ,</l>
     <l n="192">A sweet rose petal blown across the night .</l>
     <l n="193">Yet wisely now the winds had mind to crown</l>
     <l n="194">Their joyous undertaking , and upon</l>
     <l n="195">The shores of Fiji 's isles they drew their prize .</l>
     <l n="196">The maidens on the shore had seen afar</l>
     <l n="197">The stranger 's coming , and the songs were stilled</l>
     <l n="198">To hush of expectation . Even so</l>
     <l n="199">A prince might come to claim his kingdom , lone ,</l>
     <l n="200">In a frail craft , with weary eyes , and hair</l>
     <l n="201">Crowned with a fading wreath , more beautiful</l>
     <l n="202">Than all their lovers , slender , strong and young .</l>
     <l n="203">With one lithe spring he gained the yellow sand</l>
     <l n="204">And caught the boat and drew it with a swing</l>
     <l n="205">High on the beach ,— its movement seemed alive .</l>
     <l n="206">His sinewy fingers loosed the flapping sail ,</l>
     <l n="207">Gay shells clinked musical against the mast ,</l>
     <l n="208">And all the maidens , timorous as birds ,</l>
     <l n="209">Laughed at the sound with shy averted face .</l>
     <l n="210">Then straight and slender as the cocoa palm ,</l>
     <l n="211">Straight as its shaft and crowned with shining hair ,</l>
     <l n="212">The stranger lifted up his head . The wreath ,</l>
     <l n="213">Faded yet still alive thro ’ ocean 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="214">Drooped o'er his brows . His flashing sun-bright eyes</l>
     <l n="215">Struck thro ’ the group of girls as shoots a dart ,</l>
     <l n="216">And caught and quivered in sweet Taka 's breast .</l>
     <l n="217">More noble than the rest , she scorned to fear ,</l>
     <l n="218">And graceful in her modesty she faltered ,</l>
     <l n="219">Then came to meet and greet the stranger guest .</l>
     <l n="220">Erect she faced him , o'er her brow the frail</l>
     <l n="221">Curves of the crest she wore , antennæ-wise ,</l>
     <l n="222">Trembled a little . As a maid beseems ,</l>
     <l n="223">Her eyes drooped from his gaze , yet not too soon</l>
     <l n="224">To miss the gleam with which he caught the first</l>
     <l n="225">Flash of her beauty . With that glance he gained —</l>
     <l n="226">Half conscious of a gladness — that this maid</l>

     <l n="806">Malua knew her pain ,</l>
     <l n="807">And how upon its verdict hung his life .</l>
     <l n="808">Death 's flame had touched the golden rose of love .</l>
     <l n="809">If it be dross or gold , the test should tell .</l>
     <l n="810">The black gulf night that lies ‘ twixt dawn and dawn ,</l>
     <l n="811">Deepened by darker sin ,— could frail love , tired</l>
     <l n="812">With passion , hope to bridge the perilous way ?</l>
     <l n="813">His brain cried , “ No , ” his heart , “ Ah , Gods , but yes</l>
     <l n="814">Or I shall die . ”</l>

     <l n="815">He laid a tender arm</l>
     <l n="816">About the shrinking child and drew her forth</l>
     <l n="817">Along the forest path . She did not hear</l>
     <l n="818">The morning birds who blithely welcomed day ,</l>
     <l n="819">She did not see the dew upon the leaves ,</l>
     <l n="820">Glamour of dawn , but dazed with love and pain ,</l>
     <l n="821">Yielding to that she knew not , kept the way</l>
     <l n="822">Towards the forest pool .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="55">
     <l n="823">It seemed to them ,</l>
     <l n="824">Waiting the unutterable moment of their loss</l>
     <l n="825">Or utmost gain , as tho ’ the swinging earth</l>
     <l n="826">Was emptied of all life , the very air</l>
     <l n="827">Seemed hollow and unearthly , breathless pause</l>
     <l n="828">On a great brink . They reached the pool , and Taka</l>
     <l n="829">Gathered her senses till her eyes were clear</l>
     <l n="830">As shining wells of truth . She leaned no more</l>
     <l n="831">Helpless upon Malua , tho ’ his arm</l>
     <l n="832">Circled her still . Before them on the path ,</l>
     <l n="833">Noble and dead , with mute hands pleading , eyes</l>
     <l n="834">Subtle with secrets of eternity ,</l>
     <l n="835">Waited Uhila .</l>

     <l n="839">Free to decide between the mighty dead</l>
     <l n="840">And him , the weakest of all living men .</l>
     <l n="841">He spoke no word , the blood of youth once more</l>
     <l n="842">Fought with the skill , the power , the eloquence</l>
     <l n="843">Of great familiar age . If Taka drew</l>
     <l n="844">From out his arms and love a heart-beat 's time ,</l>
     <l n="845">She had decided , and Uhila won .</l>
     <l n="846">This the boy knew . Taka had seen him , Ah !</l>

     <l n="848">Shivered as tho ’ cold death had laid a hand</l>
     <l n="849">Upon her brow . Malua felt a hell</l>
     <l n="850">Deep as the world , and then — the sky , pale stars ,</l>
     <l n="851">Rose dawn , unfathomed heaven rocked in his heart</l>
     <l n="852">With tumult of his glory . Taka turned ,</l>
     <l n="853">Drew closer in his arm , and raising up</l>
     <l n="854">Her flowery face smiled in his eyes .</l>
     <l n="855">‘ Twas done —</l>
     <l n="856">Death , life and passionate passion burned away</l>
     <l n="857">In the white flame of love .</l>
     <l n="858">Uhila lay</l>
     <l n="859">Vanquished , forgotten . Turning to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="860">Taka , Malua , children of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="861">Went forth to meet the sunrise and the day .</l>
