   <p>The Troubles of Biddy</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Oh dear , ” sighed old Biddy , just under her breath ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ I really am troubled and worried to death !</l>
     <l n="3">For months I have thought of a family , dear ,</l>
     <l n="4">To gladden my heart , and to live with me here .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ But daily I find that my plans are upset ,</l>
     <l n="6">And all I can do is to sit here and fret —</l>
     <l n="7">I have n't a sign of an egg in my nest ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though some I have laid are as good as the best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ I scolded last night when my mistress came near ,</l>
     <l n="10">But though she was bitten , she seemed not to fear ;</l>
     <l n="11">She only said , ‘ Biddy , what are you about ? ’</l>
     <l n="12">And then through the doorway she simply passed out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">[ Illustration : { Girl gathering eggs . }]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">“ I do n't understand it ; I cannot see why ;</l>
     <l n="15">For surely to be a good mother I 'd try ;</l>
     <l n="16">Although I would see that they did as I said ! ”</l>
     <l n="17">And Biddy , in sorrow and grief hung her head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">[ Illustration : { Girl with eggs next to nest . }]</l>

     <l n="19">[ Illustration : { Girl placing eggs in nest . }]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="20">So deep was the longing of poor Biddy 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="21">She felt that with life she was ready to part ;</l>
     <l n="22">But glancing about in her trouble and pain</l>
     <l n="23">She saw that her mistress was coming again ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="24">And noting the basket she held in her hand</l>
     <l n="25">Old Biddy thought quickly “ she can n't understand , ”</l>
     <l n="26">And “ what is she doing ? ” exclaimed in surprise ;</l>
     <l n="27">For out of the nest Biddy felt herself rise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="28">As Biddy stood resting her poor weary legs ,</l>
     <l n="29">She saw that the basket contained shining eggs ;</l>
     <l n="30">And mistress with care placed them all in the nest</l>
     <l n="31">For Biddy to snuggle beneath her warm breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="32">Now Biddy was happy ; her burden was gone ,</l>
     <l n="33">Her troubles had vanished , she felt she had none :</l>
     <l n="34">And , planning away in her little straw bed ,</l>
     <l n="35">No thoughts of complaining came into her head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="36">[ Illustration : { Girl feeding hen in nest . }]</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="37">[ Illustration : { Shed . }]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="38">She looked from the window each morning at dawn ,</l>
     <l n="39">And pictures of rapture were constantly drawn ,</l>
     <l n="40">For , out on the lawn near a little old shed ,</l>
     <l n="41">Were dishes and troughs where the chickens were fed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="42">And Biddy thought wisely , “ These things I shall use ;</l>
     <l n="43">The largest and neatest are what I shall choose . ”</l>
     <l n="44">But never a thought did this wise mother take</l>
     <l n="45">Of danger , or trouble , in St. Mary 's lake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="46">How happy she was when the first sounds were heard ,</l>
     <l n="47">And the bright downy heads her soft feathers stirred !</l>
     <l n="48">“ But what is the matter with each little nose ? ”</l>
     <l n="49">She said in amazement , “ And what ails their toes ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="50">“ They are not like chickens at all , I am sure !</l>
     <l n="51">I wonder whatever such strange things will cure ? ”</l>
     <l n="52">And Biddy once more was in trouble most deep ;</l>
     <l n="53">For none of her children could really say peep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="54">[ Illustration : { Girl picks up duckling from nest . }]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="55">[ Illustration : { Girl pumps water into pond for ducklings . }]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="56">“ I think that my babes for a walk ought to go ; ”</l>
     <l n="57">One morning said Biddy , “ I 'll lead them just so ;</l>
     <l n="58">I 'll watch every minute lest danger arise :</l>
     <l n="59">For they 'll not be safe when from under my eyes . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="60">At the word every downy ball hustled about ,</l>
     <l n="61">And ere Biddy knew it , they all had jumped out</l>
     <l n="62">Of the nest , and were darting about in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="63">For bugs , and for grass blades , and simply for fun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="64">Biddy watched for a time and then softly said ,</l>
     <l n="65">“ I ought to be dusting my feathers and head ; ”</l>
     <l n="66">So off to the roadside she hastily went ,</l>
     <l n="67">And there in the soft sand , a few moments spent .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="23">

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="70">What was it made Biddy 's heart quiver and leap ?</l>
     <l n="71">It was n't the sound of a young chicken 's peep —</l>
     <l n="72">But the splashing of water and flutt'ring of wings —</l>
     <l n="73">And leaving the road side she screamed , “ Of all things ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="74">Her babies were all in the watering trough ,</l>
     <l n="75">Regardless of sickness , disease , and of cough .</l>
     <l n="76">“ Oh dear , ” cried poor Biddy , “ What now shall I do ?</l>
     <l n="77">My children will drown and before my eyes too ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="78">And mistress cried , “ Biddy , now please do n't you fear ,</l>
     <l n="79">They simply love water , and oh ! are n't they dear ?</l>
     <l n="80">I 'll keep them all safe , so Biddy go ‘ way !</l>
     <l n="81">And let your poor children have freedom to play . ”</l>

     <l n="83">[ Illustration : { Girl plays with ducklings . }]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="84">Each day in the trough and the puddles they played</l>
     <l n="85">And off where the grass was the deepest they stayed</l>
     <l n="86">While Biddy would search for them , clucking for hours</l>
     <l n="87">Over the barnyard and in ‘ mong the flowers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="88">The little log barn was a refuge at night</l>
     <l n="89">Where often poor Biddy for courage would fight ;</l>
     <l n="90">And there , with her feathers above her young brood ,</l>
     <l n="91">She tried to instruct them in ways to be good .</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="94">Where apples were juicy and mellow , one day ,</l>
     <l n="95">These ten naughty children were gathered to play ,</l>
     <l n="96">When suddenly one of them , leading the band ,</l>
     <l n="97">Said , “ Come , let us travel , ” and there a trip planned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="98">So off they all went toward the shed and the pump ,</l>
     <l n="99">Turning out now and then for a log or a stump ,</l>
     <l n="100">And down the steep hill where the clover bloomed bright</l>
     <l n="101">The little band wandered in perfect delight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="102">The moment that Biddy discovered the plot</l>
     <l n="103">She rushed in confusion and soon reached the spot ;</l>
     <l n="104">“ Oh children , be careful ! ” she screamed in alarm ;</l>
     <l n="105">“ In the lake I 'm sure you will meet with some harm ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="106">But to cry , and protest , and urge them to come</l>
     <l n="107">Seemed all of no use , for they would not go home .</l>
     <l n="108">And Biddy exclaimed to herself in disgust ,</l>
     <l n="109">“ To stand this I cannot , and leave them I must ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="110">The evening shades gathered that night in the sky ;</l>
     <l n="111">The wind sung most softly a sweet lula-by ;</l>
     <l n="112">But Biddy had left her dear children alone :</l>
     <l n="113">She found they were ducklings , and such could not own .</l>
