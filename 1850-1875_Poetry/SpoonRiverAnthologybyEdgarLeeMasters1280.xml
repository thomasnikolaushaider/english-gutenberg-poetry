     <item>The Hill</item>
     <item>Where are Elmer , Herman , Bert , Tom and Charley , The weak of will , the strong of arm , the clown , the boozer , the fighter ? All , all are sleeping on the hill .</item>
     <item>One passed in a fever , One was burned in a mine , One was killed in a brawl , One died in a jail , One fell from a bridge toiling for children and wife - All , all are sleeping , sleeping , sleeping on the hill .</item>
     <item>Where are Ella , Kate , Mag , Lizzie and Edith , The tender heart , the simple soul , the loud , the proud , the happy one ?— All , all are sleeping on the hill .</item>
     <item>One died in shameful child-birth , One of a thwarted love , One at the hands of a brute in a brothel , One of a broken pride , in the search for heart 's desire ; One after life in far-away London and Paris Was brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag — All , all are sleeping , sleeping , sleeping on the hill .</item>
     <item>Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily , And old Towny Kincaid and Sevigne Houghton , And Major Walker who had talked With venerable men of the revolution ?— All , all are sleeping on the hill .</item>
     <item>They brought them dead sons from the war , And daughters whom life had crushed , And their children fatherless , crying — All , all are sleeping , sleeping , sleeping on the hill . Where is Old Fiddler Jones Who played with life all his ninety years , Braving the sleet with bared breast , Drinking , rioting , thinking neither of wife nor kin , Nor gold , nor love , nor heaven ? Lo ! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago , Of the horse-races of long ago at Clary 's Grove , Of what Abe Lincoln said One time at Springfield .</item>
     <item>Hod Putt</item>
     <item>HERE I lie close to the grave Of Old Bill Piersol , Who grew rich trading with the Indians , and who Afterwards took the Bankrupt Law And emerged from it richer than ever Myself grown tired of toil and poverty And beholding how Old Bill and other grew in wealth Robbed a traveler one Night near Proctor 's Grove , Killing him unwittingly while doing so , For which I was tried and hanged . That was my way of going into bankruptcy . Now we who took the bankrupt law in our respective ways Sleep peacefully side by side .</item>
     <item>Ollie McGee</item>
     <item>Have you seen walking through the village A Man with downcast eyes and haggard face ? That is my husband who , by secret cruelty Never to be told , robbed me of my youth and my beauty ; Till at last , wrinkled and with yellow teeth , And with broken pride and shameful humility , I sank into the grave . But what think you gnaws at my husband 's heart ? The face of what I was , the face of what he made me ! These are driving him to the place where I lie . In death , therefore , I am avenged .</item>
     <item>Fletcher McGee</item>
     <item>She took my strength by minutes , She took my life by hours , She drained me like a fevered moon That saps the spinning world . The days went by like shadows , The minutes wheeled like stars . She took the pity from my heart , And made it into smiles . She was a hunk of sculptor 's clay , My secret thoughts were fingers : They flew behind her pensive brow And lined it deep with pain . They set the lips , and sagged the cheeks , And drooped the eye with sorrow . My soul had entered in the clay , Fighting like seven devils . It was not mine , it was not hers ; She held it , but its struggles Modeled a face she hated , And a face I feared to see . I beat the windows , shook the bolts . I hid me in a corner And then she died and haunted me , And hunted me for life .</item>
     <item>Robert Fulton Tanner</item>
     <item>If a man could bite the giant hand That catches and destroys him , As I was bitten by a rat While demonstrating my patent trap , In my hardware store that day . But a man can never avenge himself On the monstrous ogre Life . You enter the room that 's being born ; And then you must live work out your soul , Of the cross-current in life Which Bring honor to the dead , who lived in shame .</item>
     <item>Cassius Hueffer</item>
     <item>THEY have chiseled on my stone the words : “ His life was gentle , and the elements so mixed in him That nature might stand up and say to all the world , This was a man . ” Those who knew me smile As they read this empty rhetoric . My epitaph should have been : “ Life was not gentle to him , And the elements so mixed in him That he made warfare on life In the which he was slain . ” While I lived I could not cope with slanderous tongues , Now that I am dead I must submit to an epitaph Graven by a fool !</item>
     <item>Serepta Mason</item>
     <item>MY life 's blossom might have bloomed on all sides Save for a bitter wind which stunted my petals On the side of me which you in the village could see . From the dust I lift a voice of protest : My flowering side you never saw ! Ye living ones , ye are fools indeed Who do not know the ways of the wind And the unseen forces That govern the processes of life .</item>
     <item>Amanda Barker</item>
     <item>HENRY got me with child , Knowing that I could not bring forth life Without losing my own . In my youth therefore I entered the portals of dust . Traveler , it is believed in the village where I lived That Henry loved me with a husband 's love But I proclaim from the dust That he slew me to gratify his hatred .</item>
     <item>Chase Henry</item>
     <item>IN life I was the town drunkard ; When I died the priest denied me burial In holy ground . The which redounded to my good fortune . For the Protestants bought this lot , And buried my body here , Close to the grave of the banker Nicholas , And of his wife Priscilla . Take note , ye prudent and pious souls , Of the cross — currents in life Which bring honor to the dead , who lived in shame</item>
     <item>Judge Somers</item>
     <item>How does it happen , tell me , That I who was most erudite of lawyers , Who knew Blackstone and Coke Almost by heart , who made the greatest speech The court-house ever heard , and wrote A brief that won the praise of Justice Breese How does it happen , tell me , That I lie here unmarked , forgotten , While Chase Henry , the town drunkard , Has a marble block , topped by an urn Wherein Nature , in a mood ironical , Has sown a flowering weed ?</item>
     <item>Benjamin Pantier</item>
     <item>TOGETHER in this grave lie Benjamin Pantier , attorney at law , And Nig , his dog , constant companion , solace and friend . Down the gray road , friends , children , men and women , Passing one by one out of life , left me till I was alone With Nig for partner , bed-fellow ; comrade in drink . In the morning of life I knew aspiration and saw glory , The she , who survives me , snared my soul With a snare which bled me to death , Till I , once strong of will , lay broken , indifferent , Living with Nig in a room back of a dingy office . Under my Jaw-bone is snuggled the bony nose of Nig Our story is lost in silence . Go by , Mad world !</item>
     <item>Mrs. Benjamin Pantier</item>
     <item>I know that he told that I snared his soul With a snare which bled him to death . And all the men loved him , And most of the women pitied him . But suppose you are really a lady , and have delicate tastes , And loathe the smell of whiskey and onions , And the rhythm of Wordsworth 's “ Ode ” runs in your ears , While he goes about from morning till night Repeating bits of that common thing ; “ Oh , why should the spirit of mortal be proud ? ” And then , suppose ; You are a woman well endowed , And the only man with whom the law and morality Permit you to have the marital relation Is the very man that fills you with disgust Every time you think of it while you think of it Every time you see him ? That 's why I drove him away from home To live with his dog in a dingy room Back of his office .</item>
     <item>Reuben Pantier</item>
     <item>WELL , Emily Sparks , your prayers were not wasted , Your love was not all in vain . I owe whatever I was in life To your hope that would not give me up , To your love that saw me still as good . Dear Emily Sparks , let me tell you the story . I pass the effect of my father and mother ; The milliner 's daughter made me trouble And out I went in the world , Where I passed through every peril known Of wine and women and joy of life . One night , in a room in the Rue de Rivoli , I was drinking wine with a black-eyed cocotte , And the tears swam into my eyes . She though they were amorous tears and smiled For thought of her conquest over me . But my soul was three thousand miles away , In the days when you taught me in Spoon River . And just because you no more could love me , Nor pray for me , nor write me letters , The eternal silence of you spoke instead . And the Black-eyed cocotte took the tears for hers , As well as the deceiving kisses I gave her . Somehow , from that hour , I had a new vision Dear Emily Sparks !</item>
     <item>Emily Sparks</item>
     <item>Where is my boy , my boy In what far part of the world ? The boy I loved best of all in the school ?— I , the teacher , the old maid , the virgin heart , Who made them all my children . Did I know my boy aright , Thinking of him as a spirit aflame , Active , ever aspiring ? Oh , boy , boy , for whom I prayed and prayed In many a watchful hour at night , Do you remember the letter I wrote you Of the beautiful love of Christ ? And whether you ever took it or not , My , boy , wherever you are , Work for your soul 's sake , That all the clay of you , all of the dross of you , May yield to the fire of you , Till the fire is nothing but light !... Nothing but light !</item>

     <p>PASSER-BY , To love is to find your own soul Through the soul of the beloved one . When the beloved one withdraws itself from your soul Then you have lost your soul . It is written : “ l have a friend , But my sorrow has no friend . ” Hence my long years of solitude at the home of my father , Trying to get myself back , And to turn my sorrow into a supremer self . But there was my father with his sorrows , Sitting under the cedar tree , A picture that sank into my heart at last Bringing infinite repose . Oh , ye souls who have made life Fragrant and white as tube roses From earth 's dark soil , Eternal peace !</p>

       <l n="22">For years I was his mistress — no one knew .</l>

       <l n="25">All the time I was nothing but “ very private , ” with different men .</l>

       <l n="27">His sister called me his mistress ;</l>

       <l n="35">I must complain to the wife of Daniel 's pursuit !</l>
       <l n="36">But before I did that I begged him to fly to London with me .</l>
       <l n="37">“ Why not stay in the city just as we have ? ” he asked .</l>
       <l n="38">Then I turned submarine and revenged his repulse</l>
       <l n="39">In the arms of my dilettante friend .</l>
       <l n="40">Then up to the surface , Bearing the letter that Daniel wrote me</l>
       <l n="41">To prove my honor was all intact , showing it to his wife ,</l>

       <l n="911">And loss to many , with engendered hate</l>
       <l n="912">That flamed into the torch in Anarch hands</l>
       <l n="913">To burn the court — house , on whose blackened wreck</l>
       <l n="914">A fairer temple rose and Progress stood —</l>
       <l n="915">Sing , muse , that lit the Chian 's face with smiles</l>
       <l n="916">Who saw the ant-like Greeks and Trojans crawl</l>
       <l n="917">About Scamander , over walls , pursued</l>
       <l n="918">Or else pursuing , and the funeral pyres</l>
       <l n="919">And sacred hecatombs , and first because</l>

       <l n="924">Say first ,</l>
       <l n="925">Thou son of night , called Momus , from whose eyes</l>
       <l n="926">No secret hides , and Thalia , smiling one ,</l>
       <l n="927">What bred ‘ twixt Thomas Rhodes and John Cabanis</l>
       <l n="928">The deadly strife ? His daughter Flossie , she ,</l>
       <l n="929">Returning from her wandering with a troop</l>
       <l n="930">Of strolling players , walked the village streets ,</l>
       <l n="931">Her bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings</l>
       <l n="932">And words of serpent wisdom and a smile</l>
       <l n="933">Of cunning in her eyes . Then Thomas Rhodes ,</l>
       <l n="934">Who ruled the church and ruled the bank as well ,</l>
       <l n="935">Made known his disapproval of the maid ;</l>
       <l n="936">And all Spoon River whispered and the eyes</l>
       <l n="937">Of all the church frowned on her , till she knew</l>
       <l n="938">They feared her and condemned .</l>
       <l n="939">But them to flout</l>
       <l n="940">She gave a dance to viols and to flutes ,</l>
       <l n="941">Brought from Peoria , and many youths ,</l>
       <l n="942">But lately made regenerate through the prayers</l>
       <l n="943">Of zealous preachers and of earnest souls ,</l>
       <l n="944">Danced merrily , and sought her in the dance ,</l>
       <l n="945">Who wore a dress so low of neck that eyes</l>
       <l n="946">Down straying might survey the snowy swale</l>
       <l n="947">‘ Till it was lost in whiteness .</l>
       <l n="948">With the dance</l>
       <l n="949">The village changed to merriment from gloom .</l>
       <l n="950">The milliner , Mrs. Williams , could not fill</l>
       <l n="951">Her orders for new hats , and every seamstress</l>
       <l n="952">Plied busy needles making gowns ; old trunks</l>
       <l n="953">And chests were opened for their store of laces</l>
       <l n="954">And rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding</l>
       <l n="955">And all the youths fastidious grew of dress ;</l>
       <l n="956">Notes passed , and many a fair one 's door at eve</l>
       <l n="957">Knew a bouquet , and strolling lovers thronged</l>
       <l n="958">About the hills that overlooked the river .</l>
       <l n="959">Then , since the mercy seats more empty showed ,</l>
       <l n="960">One of God 's chosen lifted up his voice :</l>
       <l n="961">“ The woman of Babylon is among us ; rise</l>
       <l n="962">Ye sons of light and drive the wanton forth ! ”</l>
       <l n="963">So John Cabanis left the church and left</l>
       <l n="964">The hosts of law and order with his eyes</l>
       <l n="965">By anger cleared , and him the liberal cause</l>
       <l n="966">Acclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty</l>
       <l n="967">To vanquish A. D. Blood .</l>
       <l n="968">But as the war</l>
       <l n="969">Waged bitterly for votes and rumors flew</l>
       <l n="970">About the bank , and of the heavy loans</l>
       <l n="971">Which Rhodes , son had made to prop his loss</l>
       <l n="972">In wheat , and many drew their coin and left</l>
       <l n="973">The bank of Rhodes more hollow , with the talk</l>
       <l n="974">Among the liberals of another bank</l>
       <l n="975">Soon to be chartered , lo , the bubble burst</l>
       <l n="976">‘ Mid cries and curses ; but the liberals laughed</l>
       <l n="977">And in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held</l>
       <l n="978">Wise converse and inspiriting debate .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="84">
       <l n="979">High on a stage that overlooked the chairs</l>
       <l n="980">Where dozens sat , and where a pop — eyed daub</l>
       <l n="981">Of Shakespeare , very like the hired man</l>
       <l n="982">Of Christian Dallman , brow and pointed beard ,</l>
       <l n="983">Upon a drab proscenium outward stared ,</l>
       <l n="984">Sat Harmon Whitney , to that eminence ,</l>
       <l n="985">By merit raised in ribaldry and guile ,</l>
       <l n="986">And to the assembled rebels thus he spake :</l>
       <l n="987">“ Whether to lie supine and let a clique</l>
       <l n="988">Cold-blooded , scheming , hungry , singing psalms ,</l>
       <l n="989">Devour our substance , wreck our banks and drain</l>
       <l n="990">Our little hoards for hazards on the price</l>
       <l n="991">Of wheat or pork , or yet to cower beneath</l>
       <l n="992">The shadow of a spire upreared to curb</l>
       <l n="993">A breed of lackeys and to serve the bank</l>
       <l n="994">Coadjutor in greed , that is the question .</l>
       <l n="995">Shall we have music and the jocund dance ,</l>
       <l n="996">Or tolling bells ? Or shall young romance roam</l>
       <l n="997">These hills about the river , flowering now</l>
       <l n="998">To April 's tears , or shall they sit at home ,</l>
       <l n="999">Or play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see ,</l>
       <l n="1000">I ask you ? If the blood of youth runs o'er</l>
       <l n="1001">And riots ‘ gainst this regimen of gloom ,</l>
       <l n="1002">Shall we submit to have these youths and maids</l>
       <l n="1003">Branded as libertines and wantons ? ”</l>
       <l n="1004">Ere</l>
       <l n="1005">His words were done a woman 's voice called “ No ! ”</l>
       <l n="1006">Then rose a sound of moving chairs , as when</l>
       <l n="1007">The numerous swine o'erhYpppHeNrun the replenished troughs ;</l>
       <l n="1008">And every head was turned , as when a flock</l>
       <l n="1009">Of geese back-turning to the hunter 's tread</l>
       <l n="1010">Rise up with flapping wings ; then rang the hall</l>
       <l n="1011">With riotous laughter , for with battered hat</l>
       <l n="1012">Tilted upon her saucy head , and fist</l>
       <l n="1013">Raised in defiance , Daisy Fraser stood .</l>
       <l n="1014">Headlong she had been hurled from out the hall</l>
       <l n="1015">Save Wendell Bloyd , who spoke for woman 's rights ,</l>
       <l n="1016">Prevented , and the bellowing voice of Burchard .</l>
       <l n="1017">Then , mid applause she hastened toward the stage</l>
       <l n="1018">And flung both gold and silver to the cause</l>
       <l n="1019">And swiftly left the hall .</l>
       <l n="1020">Meantime upstood</l>
       <l n="1021">A giant figure , bearded like the son</l>
       <l n="1022">Of Alcmene , deep-chested , round of paunch ,</l>
       <l n="1023">And spoke in thunder : “ Over there behold</l>
       <l n="1024">A man who for the truth withstood his wife —</l>
       <l n="1025">Such is our spirit — when that A. D. Blood</l>

       <l n="1027">Quick</l>
       <l n="1028">Before Jim Brown could finish , Jefferson Howard</l>
       <l n="1029">Obtained the floor and spake : “ Ill suits the time</l>
       <l n="1030">For clownish words , and trivial is our cause</l>
       <l n="1031">If naught 's at stake but John Cabanis , wrath ,</l>
       <l n="1032">He who was erstwhile of the other side</l>
       <l n="1033">And came to us for vengeance . More 's at stake</l>
       <l n="1034">Than triumph for New England or Virginia .</l>
       <l n="1035">And whether rum be sold , or for two years</l>
       <l n="1036">As in the past two years , this town be dry</l>
       <l n="1037">Matters but little — Oh yes , revenue</l>
       <l n="1038">For sidewalks , sewers ; that is well enough !</l>
       <l n="1039">I wish to God this fight were now inspired</l>
       <l n="1040">By other passion than to salve the pride</l>
       <l n="1041">Of John Cabanis or his daughter .</l>
       <l n="1042">Why Can never contests of great moment spring</l>
       <l n="1043">From worthy things , not little ? Still , if men</l>
       <l n="1044">Must always act so , and if rum must be</l>
       <l n="1045">The symbol and the medium to release</l>
       <l n="1046">From life 's denial and from slavery ,</l>
       <l n="1047">Then give me rum ! ”</l>
       <l n="1048">Exultant cries arose .</l>
       <l n="1049">Then , as George Trimble had o'ercome his fear</l>
       <l n="1050">And vacillation and begun to speak ,</l>
       <l n="1051">The door creaked and the idiot , Willie Metcalf ,</l>
       <l n="1052">Breathless and hatless , whiter than a sheet ,</l>
       <l n="1053">Entered and cried : “ The marshal 's on his way</l>
       <l n="1054">To arrest you all . And if you only knew</l>
       <l n="1055">Who 's coming here to — morrow ; I was listening</l>
       <l n="1056">Beneath the window where the other side</l>
       <l n="1057">Are making plans . ”</l>
       <l n="1058">So to a smaller room</l>
       <l n="1059">To hear the idiot 's secret some withdrew</l>
       <l n="1060">Selected by the Chair ; the Chair himself</l>
       <l n="1061">And Jefferson Howard , Benjamin Pantier ,</l>
       <l n="1062">And Wendell Bloyd , George Trimble , Adam Weirauch ,</l>

       <l n="1069">By Daisy Fraser , some of lesser note ,</l>
       <l n="1070">And secretly conferred .</l>
       <l n="1071">But in the hall</l>
       <l n="1072">Disorder reigned and when the marshal came</l>
       <l n="1073">And found it so , he marched the hoodlums out</l>
       <l n="1074">And locked them up .</l>
       <l n="1075">Meanwhile within a room</l>
       <l n="1076">Back in the basement of the church , with Blood</l>
       <l n="1077">Counseled the wisest heads . Judge Somers first ,</l>
       <l n="1078">Deep learned in life , and next him , Elliott Hawkins</l>
       <l n="1079">And Lambert Hutchins ; next him Thomas Rhodes</l>
       <l n="1080">And Editor Whedon ; next him Garrison Standard ,</l>
       <l n="1081">A traitor to the liberals , who with lip</l>
       <l n="1082">Upcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer :</l>
       <l n="1083">“ Such strife about an insult to a woman —</l>
       <l n="1084">A girl of eighteen “ — Christian Dallman too ,</l>
       <l n="1085">And others unrecorded . Some there were</l>
       <l n="1086">Who frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule</l>
       <l n="1087">Democracy achieved thereby , the freedom</l>
       <l n="1088">And lust of life it symbolized .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="85">
       <l n="1089">Now morn with snowy fingers up the sky</l>
       <l n="1090">Flung like an orange at a festival</l>
       <l n="1091">The ruddy sun , when from their hasty beds</l>
       <l n="1092">Poured forth the hostile forces , and the streets</l>
       <l n="1093">Resounded to the rattle of the wheels</l>
       <l n="1094">That drove this way and that to gather in</l>
       <l n="1095">The tardy voters , and the cries of chieftains</l>
       <l n="1096">Who manned the battle . But at ten o'clock</l>
       <l n="1097">The liberals bellowed fraud , and at the polls</l>
       <l n="1098">The rival candidates growled and came to blows .</l>
       <l n="1099">Then proved the idiot 's tale of yester-eve</l>
       <l n="1100">A word of warning . Suddenly on the streets</l>
       <l n="1101">Walked hog-eyed Allen , terror of the hills</l>
       <l n="1102">That looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed .</l>
       <l n="1103">No man of this degenerate day could lift</l>
       <l n="1104">The boulders which he threw , and when he spoke</l>
       <l n="1105">The windows rattled , and beneath his brows</l>
       <l n="1106">Thatched like a shed with bristling hair of black ,</l>
       <l n="1107">His small eyes glistened like a maddened boar .</l>
       <l n="1108">And as he walked the boards creaked , as he walked</l>
       <l n="1109">A song of menace rumbled . Thus he came ,</l>
       <l n="1110">The champion of A. D. Blood , commissioned</l>
       <l n="1111">To terrify the liberals . Many fled</l>
       <l n="1112">As when a hawk soars o'er the chicken yard .</l>
       <l n="1113">He passed the polls and with a playful hand</l>
       <l n="1114">Touched Brown , the giant , and he fell against ,</l>
       <l n="1115">As though he were a child , the wall ; so strong</l>
       <l n="1116">Was hog-eyed Allen . But the liberals smiled .</l>
       <l n="1117">For soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk ,</l>
       <l n="1118">Close on his steps paced Bengal Mike , brought in</l>
       <l n="1119">By Kinsey Keene , the subtle-witted one ,</l>
       <l n="1120">To match the hog-eyed Allen . He was scarce</l>
       <l n="1121">Three-fourths the other 's bulk , but steel his arms ,</l>
       <l n="1122">And with a tiger 's heart . Two men he killed</l>
       <l n="1123">And many wounded in the days before ,</l>
       <l n="1124">And no one feared .</l>
       <l n="1125">But when the hog-eyed one</l>
       <l n="1126">Saw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark ,</l>
       <l n="1127">The bristles o'er his red eyes twitched with rage ,</l>
       <l n="1128">The song he rumbled lowered . Round and round</l>
       <l n="1129">The court-house paced he , followed stealthily</l>
       <l n="1130">By Bengal Mike , who jeered him every step :</l>
       <l n="1131">“ Come , elephant , and fight ! Come , hog-eyed coward !</l>
       <l n="1132">Come , face about and fight me , lumbering sneak !</l>
       <l n="1133">Come , beefy bully , hit me , if you can !</l>
       <l n="1134">Take out your gun , you duffer , give me reason</l>
       <l n="1135">To draw and kill you . Take your billy out .</l>
       <l n="1136">I 'll crack your boar 's head with a piece of brick ! ”</l>
       <l n="1137">But never a word the hog-eyed one returned</l>
       <l n="1138">But trod about the court-house , followed both</l>
       <l n="1139">By troops of boys and watched by all the men .</l>
       <l n="1140">All day , they walked the square . But when Apollo</l>
       <l n="1141">Stood with reluctant look above the hills</l>
       <l n="1142">As fain to see the end , and all the votes</l>
       <l n="1143">Were cast , and closed the polls , before the door</l>
       <l n="1144">Of Trainor 's drug store Bengal Mike , in tones</l>
       <l n="1145">That echoed through the village , bawled the taunt :</l>
       <l n="1146">“ Who was your mother , hog — eyed ? ” In a trice</l>
       <l n="1147">As when a wild boar turns upon the hound</l>
       <l n="1148">That through the brakes upon an August day</l>
       <l n="1149">Has gashed him with its teeth , the hog - one</l>
       <l n="1150">Rushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike</l>
       <l n="1151">And grabbed him by the throat . Then rose to heaven</l>
       <l n="1152">The frightened cries of boys , and yells of men</l>
       <l n="1153">Forth rushing to the street . And Bengal Mike</l>
       <l n="1154">Moved this way and now that , drew in his head</l>
       <l n="1155">As if his neck to shorten , and bent down</l>
       <l n="1156">To break the death grip of the hog-eyed one ;</l>
       <l n="1157">‘ Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength</l>
       <l n="1158">Striking his fists against the invulnerable chest</l>
       <l n="1159">Of hog-eyed Allen . Then , when some came in</l>
       <l n="1160">To part them , others stayed them , and the fight</l>
       <l n="1161">Spread among dozens ; many valiant souls</l>
       <l n="1162">Went down from clubs and bricks .</l>
       <l n="1163">But tell me , Muse ,</l>
       <l n="1164">What god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike ?</l>
       <l n="1165">With one last , mighty struggle did he grasp</l>
       <l n="1166">The murderous hands and turning kick his foe .</l>
       <l n="1167">Then , as if struck by lightning , vanished all</l>
       <l n="1168">The strength from hog — eyed Allen , at his side</l>
       <l n="1169">Sank limp those giant arms and o'er his face</l>
       <l n="1170">Dread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread .</l>
       <l n="1171">And those great knees , invincible but late ,</l>
       <l n="1172">Shook to his weight . And quickly as the lion</l>
       <l n="1173">Leaps on its wounded prey , did Bengal Mike</l>
       <l n="1174">Smite with a rock the temple of his foe ,</l>
       <l n="1175">And down he sank and darkness o'er his eyes</l>
       <l n="1176">Passed like a cloud .</l>
       <l n="1177">As when the woodman fells</l>
       <l n="1178">Some giant oak upon a summer 's day</l>
       <l n="1179">And all the songsters of the forest shrill ,</l>
       <l n="1180">And one great hawk that has his nestling young</l>
       <l n="1181">Amid the topmost branches croaks , as crash</l>
       <l n="1182">The leafy branches through the tangled boughs</l>
       <l n="1183">Of brother oaks , so fell the hog — eyed one</l>
       <l n="1184">Amid the lamentations of the friends</l>
