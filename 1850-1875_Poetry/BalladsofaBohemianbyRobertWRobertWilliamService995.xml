     <l n="2">The Gods of Excellence to please ,</l>
     <l n="3">This hand of mine will never smite</l>
     <l n="4">The Harp of High Serenities .</l>
     <l n="5">Mere minstrel of the street am I ,</l>
     <l n="6">To whom a careless coin you fling ;</l>
     <l n="7">But who , beneath the bitter sky ,</l>
     <l n="8">Blue-lipped , yet insolent of eye ,</l>
     <l n="9">Can shrill a song of Spring ;</l>
     <l n="10">A song of merry mansard days ,</l>
     <l n="11">The cheery chimney-tops among ;</l>
     <l n="12">Of rolics and of roundelays</l>
     <l n="13">When we were young . . . when we were young ;</l>
     <l n="14">A song of love and lilac nights ,</l>
     <l n="15">Of wit , of wisdom and of wine ;</l>
     <l n="16">Of Folly whirling on the Heights ,</l>
     <l n="17">Of hunger and of hope divine ;</l>
     <l n="18">Of Blanche , Suzette and Celestine ,</l>
     <l n="19">And all that gay and tender band</l>
     <l n="20">Who shared with us the fat , the lean ,</l>
     <l n="21">The hazard of Illusion-land ;</l>
     <l n="22">When scores of Philistines we slew</l>
     <l n="23">As mightily with brush and pen</l>
     <l n="24">We sought to make the world anew ,</l>
     <l n="25">And scorned the gods of other men ;</l>
     <l n="26">When we were fools divinely wise ,</l>
     <l n="27">Who held it rapturous to strive ;</l>
     <l n="28">When Art was sacred in our eyes ,</l>
     <l n="29">And it was Heav'n to be alive . . . .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="30">O days of glamor , glory , truth ,</l>

     <l n="33">Bohemia , the lost , alas !</l>
     <l n="34">O laughing lads who led the romp ,</l>
     <l n="35">Respectable you 've grown , I 'm told ;</l>
     <l n="36">Your heads you bow to power and pomp ,</l>
     <l n="37">You 've learned to know the worth of gold .</l>
     <l n="38">O merry maids who shared our cheer ,</l>
     <l n="39">Your eyes are dim , your locks are gray ;</l>
     <l n="40">And as you scrub I sadly fear</l>
     <l n="41">Your daughters speed the dance to-day .</l>

     <l n="49">Ere yet you drink your liquor up ;</l>
     <l n="50">And hear my simple songs of earth ,</l>
     <l n="51">Of youth and truth and living things ;</l>
     <l n="52">Of poverty and proper mirth ,</l>
     <l n="53">Of rags and rich imaginings ;</l>
     <l n="54">Of cock-a-hoop , blue-heavened days ,</l>
     <l n="55">Of hearts elate and eager breath ,</l>
     <l n="56">Of wonder , worship , pity , praise ,</l>
     <l n="57">Of sorrow , sacrifice and death ;</l>
     <l n="58">Of lusting , laughter , passion , pain ,</l>
     <l n="59">Of lights that lure and dreams that thrall . . .</l>
     <l n="60">And if a golden word I gain ,</l>
     <l n="61">Oh , kindly folks , God save you all !</l>
     <l n="62">And if you shake your heads in blame . . .</l>
     <l n="63">Good friends , God love you all the same .</l>

      <l n="2">April 1914 .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>All day the sun has shone into my little attic , a bitter sunshine that brightened yet did not warm . And so as I toiled and toiled doggedly enough , many were the looks I cast at the three faggots I had saved to cook my evening meal . Now , however , my supper is over , my pipe alight , and as I stretch my legs before the embers I have at last a glow of comfort , a glimpse of peace .</p>
   <p>My Garret</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Here is my Garret up five flights of stairs ;</l>
     <l n="2">Here 's where I deal in dreams and ply in fancies ,</l>
     <l n="3">Here is the wonder-shop of all my wares ,</l>
     <l n="4">My sounding sonnets and my red romances .</l>
     <l n="5">Here 's where I challenge Fate and ring my rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="6">And grope at glory — aye , and starve at times .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Here is my Stronghold : stout of heart am I ,</l>
     <l n="8">Greeting each dawn as songful as a linnet ;</l>
     <l n="9">And when at night on yon poor bed I lie</l>
     <l n="10">( Blessing the world and every soul that 's in it ) ,</l>
     <l n="11">Here 's where I thank the Lord no shadow bars</l>
     <l n="12">My skylight 's vision of the valiant stars .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Here is my Palace tapestried with dreams .</l>
     <l n="14">Ah ! though to-night ten sous are all my treasure ,</l>
     <l n="15">While in my gaze immortal beauty gleams ,</l>
     <l n="16">Am I not dowered with wealth beyond all measure ?</l>
     <l n="17">Though in my ragged coat my songs I sing ,</l>
     <l n="18">King of my soul , I envy not the king .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Here is my Haven : it 's so quiet here ;</l>
     <l n="20">Only the scratch of pen , the candle 's flutter ;</l>
     <l n="21">Shabby and bare and small , but O how dear !</l>
     <l n="22">Mark you — my table with my work a-clutter ,</l>
     <l n="23">My shelf of tattered books along the wall ,</l>
     <l n="24">My bed , my broken chair — that 's nearly all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Only four faded walls , yet mine , all mine .</l>
     <l n="26">Oh , you fine folks , a pauper scorns your pity .</l>
     <l n="27">Look , where above me stars of rapture shine ;</l>
     <l n="28">See , where below me gleams the siren city . . .</l>
     <l n="29">Am I not rich ?— a millionaire no less ,</l>
     <l n="30">If wealth be told in terms of Happiness .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Ten sous . . . . I think one can sing best of poverty when one is holding it at arm 's length . I 'm sure that when I wrote these lines , fortune had for a moment tweaked me by the nose . To-night , however , I am truly down to ten sous . It is for that I have stayed in my room all day , rolled in my blankets and clutching my pen with clammy fingers . I must work , work , work . I must finish my book before poverty crushes me . I am not only writing for my living but for my life . Even to-day my Muse was mutinous . For hours and hours anxiously I stared at a paper that was blank ; nervously I paced up and down my garret ; bitterly I flung myself on my bed . Then suddenly it all came . Line after line I wrote with hardly a halt . So I made another of my Ballads of the Boulevards . Here it is :</p>
   <p>Julot the Apache</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">You 've heard of Julot the apache , and Gigolette , his môme . . . .</l>
     <l n="2">Montmartre was their hunting-ground , but Belville was their home .</l>
     <l n="3">A little chap just like a boy , with smudgy black mustache ,—</l>
     <l n="4">Yet there was nothing juvenile in Julot the apache .</l>
     <l n="5">From head to heel as tough as steel , as nimble as a cat ,</l>
     <l n="6">With every trick of twist and kick , a master of savate .</l>
     <l n="7">And Gigolette was tall and fair , as stupid as a cow ,</l>
     <l n="8">With three combs in the greasy hair she banged upon her brow .</l>
     <l n="9">You 'd see her on the Place Pigalle on any afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="10">A primitive and strapping wench as brazen as the moon .</l>
     <l n="11">And yet there is a tale that 's told of Clichy after dark ,</l>
     <l n="12">And two gendarmes who swung their arms with Julot for a mark .</l>
     <l n="13">And oh , but they 'd have got him too ; they banged and blazed away ,</l>
     <l n="14">When like a flash a woman leapt between them and their prey .</l>
     <l n="15">She took the medicine meant for him ; she came down with a crash . . .</l>
     <l n="16">“ Quick now , and make your get-away , O Julot the apache ! ” . . .</l>
     <l n="17">But no ! He turned , ran swiftly back , his arms around her met ;</l>
     <l n="18">They nabbed him sobbing like a kid , and kissing Gigolette .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">Now I 'm a reckless painter chap who loves a jamboree ,</l>
     <l n="20">And one night in Cyrano 's bar I got upon a spree ;</l>
     <l n="21">And there were trollops all about , and crooks of every kind ,</l>
     <l n="22">But though the place was reeling round I did n't seem to mind .</l>
     <l n="23">Till down I sank , and all was blank when in the bleary dawn</l>
     <l n="24">I woke up in my studio to find — my money gone ;</l>
     <l n="25">Three hundred francs I 'd scraped and squeezed to pay my quarter 's rent .</l>
     <l n="26">“ Some one has pinched my wad , ” I wailed ; “ it never has been spent . ”</l>
     <l n="27">And as I racked my brains to seek how I could raise some more ,</l>
     <l n="28">Before my cruel landlord kicked me cowering from the door :</l>
     <l n="29">A knock . . . “ Come in , ” I gruffly groaned ; I did not raise my head ,</l>
     <l n="30">Then lo ! I heard a husky voice , a swift and silky tread :</l>
     <l n="31">“ You got so blind , last night , mon vieux , I collared all your cash —</l>
     <l n="32">Three hundred francs . . . . There ! Nom de Dieu , ” said Julot the apache .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">And that was how I came to know Julot and Gigolette ,</l>
     <l n="34">And we would talk and drink a bock , and smoke a cigarette .</l>
     <l n="35">And I would meditate upon the artistry of crime ,</l>
     <l n="36">And he would tell of cracking cribs and cops and doing time ;</l>
     <l n="37">Or else when he was flush of funds he 'd carelessly explain</l>
     <l n="38">He 'd biffed some bloated bourgeois on the border of the Seine .</l>
     <l n="39">So gentle and polite he was , just like a man of peace ,</l>
     <l n="40">And not a desperado and the terror of the police .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="41">Now one day in a bistro that 's behind the Place Vendôme</l>
     <l n="42">I came on Julot the apache , and Gigolette his môme .</l>
     <l n="43">And as they looked so very grave , says I to them , says I ,</l>
     <l n="44">“ Come on and have a little glass , it 's good to rinse the eye .</l>
     <l n="45">You both look mighty serious ; you 've something on the heart . ”</l>
     <l n="46">“ Ah , yes , ” said Julot the apache , “ we 've something to impart .</l>
     <l n="47">When such things come to folks like us , it is n't very gay . . .</l>
     <l n="48">It 's Gigolette — she tells me that a gosse is on the way . ”</l>
     <l n="49">Then Gigolette , she looked at me with eyes like stones of gall :</l>
     <l n="50">“ If we were honest folks , ” said she , “ I would n't mind at all .</l>
     <l n="51">But then . . . you know the life we lead ; well , anyway I mean</l>
     <l n="52">( That is , providing it 's a girl ) to call her Angeline . ”</l>
     <l n="53">“ Cheer up , ” said I ; “ it 's all in life . There 's gold within the dross .</l>
     <l n="54">Come on , we 'll drink another verre to Angeline the gosse . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="55">And so the weary winter passed , and then one April morn</l>
     <l n="56">The worthy Julot came at last to say the babe was born .</l>
     <l n="57">“ I 'd like to chuck it in the Seine , ” he sourly snarled , “ and yet</l>
     <l n="58">I guess I 'll have to let it live , because of Gigolette . ”</l>
     <l n="59">I only laughed , for sure I saw his spite was all a bluff ,</l>
     <l n="60">And he was prouder than a prince behind his manner gruff .</l>
     <l n="61">Yet every day he 'd blast the brat with curses deep and grim ,</l>
     <l n="62">And swear to me that Gigolette no longer thought of him .</l>
     <l n="63">And then one night he dropped the mask ; his eyes were sick with dread ,</l>
     <l n="64">And when I offered him a smoke he groaned and shook his head :</l>
     <l n="65">“ I 'm all upset ; it 's Angeline . . . she 's covered with a rash . . .</l>
     <l n="66">She 'll maybe die , my little gosse , ” cried Julot the apache .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="67">But Angeline , I joy to say , came through the test all right ,</l>
     <l n="68">Though Julot , so they tell me , watched beside her day and night .</l>
     <l n="69">And when I saw him next , says he : “ Come up and dine with me .</l>
     <l n="70">We 'll buy a beefsteak on the way , a bottle and some brie . ”</l>
     <l n="71">And so I had a merry night within his humble home ,</l>
     <l n="72">And laughed with Angeline the gosse and Gigolette the môme .</l>
     <l n="73">And every time that Julot used a word the least obscene ,</l>
     <l n="74">How Gigolette would frown at him and point to Angeline :</l>
     <l n="75">Oh , such a little innocent , with hair of silken floss ,</l>
     <l n="76">I do not wonder they were proud of Angeline the gosse .</l>
     <l n="77">And when her arms were round his neck , then Julot says to me :</l>
     <l n="78">“ I must work harder now , mon vieux , since I 've to work for three . ”</l>
     <l n="79">He worked so very hard indeed , the police dropped in one day ,</l>
     <l n="80">And for a year behind the bars they put him safe away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="81">So dark and silent now , their home ; they 'd gone — I wondered where ,</l>
     <l n="82">Till in a laundry near I saw a child with shining hair ;</l>
     <l n="83">And o'er the tub a strapping wench , her arms in soapy foam ;</l>
     <l n="84">Lo ! it was Angeline the gosse , and Gigolette the môme .</l>
     <l n="85">And so I kept an eye on them and saw that all went right ,</l>
     <l n="86">Until at last came Julot home , half crazy with delight .</l>
     <l n="87">And when he 'd kissed them both , says he : “ I 've had my fill this time .</l>
     <l n="88">I 'm on the honest now , I am ; I 'm all fed up with crime .</l>
     <l n="89">You mark my words , the page I turn is going to be clean ,</l>
     <l n="90">I swear it on the head of her , my little Angeline . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="91">And so , to finish up my tale , this morning as I strolled</l>
     <l n="92">Along the boulevard I heard a voice I knew of old .</l>
     <l n="93">I saw a rosy little man with walrus-like mustache . . .</l>
     <l n="94">I stopped , I stared . . . . By all the gods ! ‘ twas Julot the apache .</l>

   <p>To-day is an anniversary . A year ago to-day I kicked over an office stool and came to Paris thinking to make a living by my pen . I was twenty then , and in my pocket I had twenty pounds . Of that , my ten sous are all that remain . And so to-night I am going to spend them , not prudently on bread , but prodigally on beer .</p>
   <p>As I stroll down the Boul ’ Mich ’ the lingering light has all the exquisite tenderness of violet ; the trees are in their first translucent green ; beneath them the lamps are lit with purest gold , and from the Little Luxembourg comes a silver jangle of tiny voices . Taking the gay side of the street , I enter a cafe . Although it is n't its true name , I choose to call my cafe —</p>
   <p>L'Escargot D'Or</p>

   <p>There ! my pipe is out . Let me light it again and consider . I have no illusions about myself . I am not fool enough to think I am a poet , but I have a knack of rhyme and I love to make verses . Mine is a tootling , tin-whistle music . Humbly and afar I follow in the footsteps of Praed and Lampson , of Field and Riley , hoping that in time my Muse may bring me bread and butter . So far , however , it has been all kicks and no coppers . And to-night I am at the end of my tether . I wish I knew where to-morrow 's breakfast was coming from . Well , since rhyming 's been my ruin , let me rhyme to the bitter end .</p>

   <p>Scarcely do I scribble that last line on the back of an old envelope when a voice hails me . It is a fellow free-lance , a short-story man called MacBean . He is having a feast of Marennes and he asks me to join him .</p>
   <p>MacBean is a Scotsman with the soul of an Irishman . He has a keen , lean , spectacled face , and if it were not for his gray hair he might be taken for a student of theology . However , there is nothing of the Puritan in MacBean . He loves wine and women , and money melts in his fingers .</p>
   <p>He has lived so long in the Quarter he looks at life from the Parisian angle . His knowledge of literature is such that he might be a Professor , but he would rather be a vagabond of letters . We talk shop . We discuss the American short story , but MacBean vows they do these things better in France . He says that some of the contes printed every day in the Journal are worthy of Maupassant . After that he buys more beer , and we roam airily over the fields of literature , plucking here and there a blossom of quotation . A fine talk , vivid and eager . It puts me into a kind of glow .</p>
   <p>MacBean pays the bill from a handful of big notes , and the thought of my own empty pockets for a moment damps me . However , when we rise to go , it is well after midnight , and I am in a pleasant daze . The rest of the evening may be summed up in the following jingle :</p>

   <p>Hurrah ! As I opened my eyes this morning to a hard , unfeeling world , little did I think what a surprise awaited me . A big blue envelope had been pushed under my door . Another rejection , I thought , and I took it up distastefully . The next moment I was staring at my first cheque .</p>
   <p>It was an express order for two hundred francs , in payment of a bit of verse .. . . So to-day I will celebrate . I will lunch at the D'Harcourt , I will dine on the Grand Boulevard , I will go to the theater .</p>
   <p>Well , here 's the thing that has turned the tide for me . It is somewhat in the vein of “ Sourdough ” Service , the Yukon bard . I do n't think much of his stuff , but they say he makes heaps of money . I can well believe it , for he drives a Hispano-Suiza in the Bois every afternoon . The other night he was with a crowd at the Dome Cafe , a chubby chap who sits in a corner and seldom speaks . I was disappointed . I thought he was a big , hairy man who swore like a trooper and mixed brandy with his beer . He only drank Vichy , poor fellow !</p>

     <l n="1">Of course you 've heard of the Nancy Lee , and how she sailed away</l>
     <l n="2">On her famous quest of the Arctic flea , to the wilds of Hudson 's Bay ?</l>
     <l n="3">For it was a foreign Prince 's whim to collect this tiny cuss ,</l>
     <l n="4">And a golden quid was no more to him than a copper to coves like us .</l>
     <l n="5">So we sailed away and our hearts were gay as we gazed on the gorgeous scene ;</l>
     <l n="6">And we laughed with glee as we caught the flea of the wolf and the wolverine ;</l>
     <l n="7">Yea , our hearts were light as the parasite of the ermine rat we slew ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the great musk ox , and the silver fox , and the moose and the caribou .</l>
     <l n="9">And we laughed with zest as the insect pest of the marmot crowned our zeal ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the wary mink and the wily “ link ” , and the walrus and the seal .</l>
     <l n="11">And with eyes aglow on the scornful snow we danced a rigadoon ,</l>
     <l n="12">Round the lonesome lair of the Arctic hare , by the light of the silver moon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">But the time was nigh to homeward hie , when , imagine our despair !</l>
     <l n="14">For the best of the lot we had n't got — the flea of the polar bear .</l>
     <l n="15">Oh , his face was long and his breath was strong , as the Skipper he says to me :</l>
     <l n="16">“ I wants you to linger ‘ ere , my lad , by the shores of the Hartic Sea ;</l>
     <l n="17">I wants you to ‘ unt the polar bear the perishin ’ winter through ,</l>
     <l n="18">And if flea ye find of its breed and kind , there 's a ‘ undred quid for you . ”</l>
     <l n="19">But I shook my head : “ No , Cap , ” I said ; “ it 's yourself I 'd like to please ,</l>
     <l n="20">But I tells ye flat I would n't do that if ye went on yer bended knees . ”</l>
     <l n="21">Then the Captain spat in the seething brine , and he says : “ Good luck to you ,</l>
     <l n="22">If it can n't be did for a ‘ undred quid , supposin ’ we call it two ? ”</l>
     <l n="23">So that was why they said good-by , and they sailed and left me there —</l>
     <l n="24">Alone , alone in the Arctic Zone to hunt for the polar bear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">Oh , the days were slow and packed with woe ,</l>
     <l n="26">till I thought they would never end ;</l>
     <l n="27">And I used to sit when the fire was lit , with my pipe for my only friend .</l>
     <l n="28">And I tried to sing some rollicky thing , but my song broke off in a prayer ,</l>
     <l n="29">And I 'd drowse and dream by the driftwood gleam ; I 'd dream of a polar bear ;</l>
     <l n="30">I 'd dream of a cloudlike polar bear that blotted the stars on high ,</l>
     <l n="31">With ravenous jaws and flenzing claws , and the flames of hell in his eye .</l>
     <l n="32">And I 'd trap around on the frozen ground , as a proper hunter ought ,</l>
     <l n="33">And beasts I 'd find of every kind , but never the one I sought .</l>
     <l n="34">Never a track in the white ice-pack that humped and heaved and flawed ,</l>
     <l n="35">Till I came to think : “ Why , strike me pink ! if the creature ai n't a fraud . ”</l>
     <l n="36">And then one night in the waning light , as I hurried home to sup ,</l>
     <l n="37">I hears a roar by the cabin door , and a great white hulk heaves up .</l>
     <l n="38">So my rifle flashed , and a bullet crashed ; dead , dead as a stone fell he ,</l>
     <l n="39">And I gave a cheer , for there in his ear — Gosh ding me !— a tiny flea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="40">At last , at last ! Oh , I clutched it fast , and I gazed on it with pride ;</l>
     <l n="41">And I thrust it into a biscuit-tin , and I shut it safe inside ;</l>
     <l n="42">With a lid of glass for the light to pass , and space to leap and play ;</l>
     <l n="43">Oh , it kept alive ; yea , seemed to thrive , as I watched it night and day .</l>
     <l n="44">And I used to sit and sing to it , and I shielded it from harm ,</l>
     <l n="45">And many a hearty feed it had on the heft of my hairy arm .</l>
     <l n="46">For you 'll never know in that land of snow how lonesome a man can feel ;</l>
     <l n="47">So I made a fuss of the little cuss , and I christened it “ Lucille ” .</l>
     <l n="48">But the longest winter has its end , and the ice went out to sea ,</l>
     <l n="49">And I saw one day a ship in the bay , and there was the Nancy Lee .</l>
     <l n="50">So a boat was lowered and I went aboard , and they opened wide their eyes —</l>
     <l n="51">Yes , they gave a cheer when the truth was clear ,</l>
     <l n="52">and they saw my precious prize .</l>
     <l n="53">And then it was all like a giddy dream ; but to cut my story short ,</l>
     <l n="54">We sailed away on the fifth of May to the foreign Prince 's court ;</l>
     <l n="55">To a palmy land and a palace grand , and the little Prince was there ,</l>
     <l n="56">And a fat Princess in a satin dress with a crown of gold on her hair .</l>
     <l n="57">And they showed me into a shiny room , just him and her and me ,</l>
     <l n="58">And the Prince he was pleased and friendly-like ,</l>
     <l n="59">and he calls for drinks for three .</l>
     <l n="60">And I shows them my battered biscuit-tin , and I makes my modest spiel ,</l>
     <l n="61">And they laughed , they did , when I opened the lid ,</l>
     <l n="62">and out there popped Lucille .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="63">Oh , the Prince was glad , I could soon see that , and the Princess she was too ;</l>
     <l n="64">And Lucille waltzed round on the tablecloth as she often used to do .</l>
     <l n="65">And the Prince pulled out a purse of gold , and he put it in my hand ;</l>
     <l n="66">And he says : “ It was worth all that , I 'm told , to stay in that nasty land . ”</l>
     <l n="67">And then he turned with a sudden cry , and he clutched at his royal beard ;</l>
     <l n="68">And the Princess screamed , and well she might — for Lucille had disappeared .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="69">“ She must be here , ” said his Noble Nibbs , so we hunted all around ;</l>
     <l n="70">Oh , we searched that place , but never a trace of the little beast we found .</l>
     <l n="71">So I shook my head , and I glumly said : “ Gol darn the saucy cuss !</l>
     <l n="72">It 's mighty queer , but she is n't here ; so . . . she must be on one of us .</l>
     <l n="73">You 'll pardon me if I make so free , but — there 's just one thing to do :</l>
     <l n="74">If you 'll kindly go for a half a mo ’ I 'll search me garments through . ”</l>
     <l n="75">Then all alone on the shiny throne I stripped from head to heel ;</l>
     <l n="76">In vain , in vain ; it was very plain that I had n't got Lucille .</l>
     <l n="77">So I garbed again , and I told the Prince , and he scratched his august head ;</l>
     <l n="78">“ I suppose if she has n't selected you , it must be me , ” he said .</l>
     <l n="79">So he retired ; but he soon came back , and his features showed distress :</l>
     <l n="80">“ Oh , it is n't you and it is n't me . ” . . . Then we looked at the Princess .</l>
     <l n="81">So she retired ; and we heard a scream , and she opened wide the door ;</l>
     <l n="82">And her fingers twain were pinched to pain , but a radiant smile she wore :</l>
     <l n="83">“ It 's here , ” she cries , “ our precious prize .</l>
     <l n="84">Oh , I found it right away . . . . ”</l>
     <l n="85">Then I ran to her with a shout of joy , but I choked with a wild dismay .</l>
     <l n="86">I clutched the back of the golden throne , and the room began to reel . . .</l>
     <l n="87">What she held to me was , ah yes ! a flea , but . . . it was n't my Lucille .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>After all , I did not celebrate . I sat on the terrace of the Cafe Napolitain on the Grand Boulevard , half hypnotized by the passing crowd . And as I sat I fell into conversation with a god-like stranger who sipped some golden ambrosia . He told me he was an actor and introduced me to his beverage , which he called a “ Suze-Anni ” . He soon left me , but the effect of the golden liquid remained , and there came over me a desire to write . C'était plus fort que moi . So instead of going to the Folies Bergère I spent all evening in the Omnium Bar near the Bourse , and wrote the following :</p>

   <p>It is strange how one works easily at times . I wrote this so quickly that I might almost say I had reached the end before I had come to the beginning . In such a mood I wonder why everybody does not write poetry .

   <p>Never is the city so lovely as in this month of May , when all the trees are in the fullness of their foliage . As I look , I feel a freshness of vision in my eyes . Wonder wakes in me . The simplest things move me to delight .</p>

   <p>Yesterday I finished my tenth ballad . When I have done about a score I will seek a publisher . If I cannot find one , I will earn , beg or steal the money to get them printed . Then if they do not sell I will hawk them from door to door . Oh , I 'll succeed , I know I 'll succeed . And yet I do n't want an easy success ; give me the joy of the fight , the thrill of the adventure . Here 's my last ballad :</p>
   <p>The Absinthe Drinkers</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He 's yonder , on the terrace of the Cafe de la Paix ,</l>
     <l n="2">The little wizened Spanish man , I see him every day .</l>
     <l n="3">He 's sitting with his Pernod on his customary chair ;</l>
     <l n="4">He 's staring at the passers with his customary stare .</l>
     <l n="5">He never takes his piercing eyes from off that moving throng ,</l>
     <l n="6">That current cosmopolitan meandering along :</l>
     <l n="7">Dark diplomats from Martinique , pale Rastas from Peru ,</l>
     <l n="8">An Englishman from Bloomsbury , a Yank from Kalamazoo ;</l>
     <l n="9">A poet from Montmartre 's heights , a dapper little Jap ,</l>
     <l n="10">Exotic citizens of all the countries on the map ;</l>
     <l n="11">A tourist horde from every land that 's underneath the sun —</l>
     <l n="12">That little wizened Spanish man , he misses never one .</l>
     <l n="13">Oh , foul or fair he 's always there , and many a drink he buys ,</l>
     <l n="14">And there 's a fire of red desire within his hollow eyes .</l>
     <l n="15">And sipping of my Pernod , and a-knowing what I know ,</l>
     <l n="16">Sometimes I want to shriek aloud and give away the show .</l>
     <l n="17">I 've lost my nerve ; he 's haunting me ; he 's like a beast of prey ,</l>
     <l n="18">That Spanish man that 's watching at the Cafe de la Paix .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">Say ! Listen and I 'll tell you all . . . the day was growing dim ,</l>
     <l n="20">And I was with my Pernod at the table next to him ;</l>
     <l n="21">And he was sitting soberly as if he were asleep ,</l>
     <l n="22">When suddenly he seemed to tense , like tiger for a leap .</l>
     <l n="23">And then he swung around to me , his hand went to his hip ,</l>
     <l n="24">My heart was beating like a gong — my arm was in his grip ;</l>
     <l n="25">His eyes were glaring into mine ; aye , though I shrank with fear ,</l>
     <l n="26">His fetid breath was on my face , his voice was in my ear :</l>
     <l n="27">“ Excuse my brusquerie , ” he hissed ; “ but , sir , do you suppose —</l>
     <l n="28">That portly man who passed us had a wen upon his nose ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">And then at last it dawned on me , the fellow must be mad ;</l>
     <l n="30">And when I soothingly replied : “ I do not think he had , ”</l>
     <l n="31">The little wizened Spanish man subsided in his chair ,</l>
     <l n="32">And shrouded in his raven cloak resumed his owlish stare .</l>
     <l n="33">But when I tried to slip away he turned and glared at me ,</l>
     <l n="34">And oh , that fishlike face of his was sinister to see :</l>
     <l n="35">“ Forgive me if I startled you ; of course you think I 'm queer ;</l>
     <l n="36">No doubt you wonder who I am , so solitary here ;</l>
     <l n="37">You question why the passers-by I piercingly review . . .</l>
     <l n="38">Well , listen , my bibacious friend , I 'll tell my tale to you .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="39">“ It happened twenty years ago , and in another land :</l>
     <l n="40">A maiden young and beautiful , two suitors for her hand .</l>
     <l n="41">My rival was the lucky one ; I vowed I would repay ;</l>
     <l n="42">Revenge has mellowed in my heart , it 's rotten ripe to-day .</l>
     <l n="43">My happy rival skipped away , vamoosed , he left no trace ;</l>
     <l n="44">And so I 'm waiting , waiting here to meet him face to face ;</l>
     <l n="45">For has it not been ever said that all the world one day</l>
     <l n="46">Will pass in pilgrimage before the Cafe de la Paix ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">“ But , sir , ” I made remonstrance , “ if it 's twenty years ago ,</l>
     <l n="48">You 'd scarcely recognize him now , he must have altered so . ”</l>
     <l n="49">The little wizened Spanish man he laughed a hideous laugh ,</l>
     <l n="50">And from his cloak he quickly drew a faded photograph .</l>
     <l n="51">“ You 're right , ” said he , “ but there are traits ( oh , this you must allow )</l>
     <l n="52">That never change ; Lopez was fat , he must be fatter now .</l>
     <l n="53">His paunch is senatorial , he cannot see his toes ,</l>
     <l n="54">I 'm sure of it ; and then , behold ! that wen upon his nose .</l>
     <l n="55">I 'm looking for a man like that . I 'll wait and wait until . . . ”</l>
     <l n="56">“ What will you do ? ” I sharply cried ; he answered me : “ Why , kill !</l>
     <l n="57">He robbed me of my happiness — nay , stranger , do not start ;</l>
     <l n="58">I 'll firmly and politely put — a bullet in his heart . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="59">And then that little Spanish man , with big cigar alight ,</l>
     <l n="60">Uprose and shook my trembling hand and vanished in the night .</l>
     <l n="61">And I went home and thought of him and had a dreadful dream</l>
     <l n="62">Of portly men with each a wen , and woke up with a scream .</l>
     <l n="63">And sure enough , next morning , as I prowled the Boulevard ,</l>
     <l n="64">A portly man with wenny nose roamed into my regard ;</l>
     <l n="65">Then like a flash I ran to him and clutched him by the arm :</l>
     <l n="66">“ Oh , sir , ” said I , “ I do not wish to see you come to harm ;</l>
     <l n="67">But if your life you value aught , I beg , entreat and pray —</l>
     <l n="68">Do n't pass before the terrace of the Cafe de la Paix . ”</l>
     <l n="69">That portly man he looked at me with such a startled air ,</l>
     <l n="70">Then bolted like a rabbit down the rue Michaudière .</l>
     <l n="71">“ Ha ! ha ! I 've saved a life , ” I thought ; and laughed in my relief ,</l>
     <l n="72">And straightway joined the Spanish man o'er his apéritif .</l>
     <l n="73">And thus each day I dodged about and kept the strictest guard</l>
     <l n="74">For portly men with each a wen upon the Boulevard .</l>
     <l n="75">And then I hailed my Spanish pal , and sitting in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="76">We ordered many Pernods and we drank them every one .</l>
     <l n="77">And sternly he would stare and stare until my hand would shake ,</l>
     <l n="78">And grimly he would glare and glare until my heart would quake .</l>
     <l n="79">And I would say : “ Alphonso , lad , I must expostulate ;</l>
     <l n="80">Why keep alive for twenty years the furnace of your hate ?</l>
     <l n="81">Perhaps his wedded life was hell ; and you , at least , are free . . . ”</l>
     <l n="82">“ That 's where you 've got it wrong , ” he snarled ; “ the fool she took was me .</l>
     <l n="83">My rival sneaked , threw up the sponge , betrayed himself a churl :</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Twas he who got the happiness , I only got — the girl . ”</l>
     <l n="85">With that he looked so devil-like he made me creep and shrink ,</l>
     <l n="86">And there was nothing else to do but buy another drink .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="87">Now yonder like a blot of ink he sits across the way ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="4">To-day within a grog-shop near</l>
      <l n="5">I saw a newly captured linnet ,</l>
      <l n="6">Who beat against his cage in fear ,</l>
      <l n="7">And fell exhausted every minute ;</l>
      <l n="8">And when I asked the fellow there</l>
      <l n="9">If he to sell the bird were willing ,</l>
      <l n="10">He told me with a careless air</l>
      <l n="11">That I could have it for a shilling .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="12">And so I bought it , cage and all</l>
      <l n="13">( Although I went without my dinner ) ,</l>
      <l n="14">And where some trees were fairly tall</l>
      <l n="15">And houses shrank and smoke was thinner ,</l>
      <l n="16">The tiny door I open threw ,</l>
      <l n="17">As down upon the grass I sank me :</l>
      <l n="18">Poor little chap ! How quick he flew . . .</l>
      <l n="19">He did n't even wait to thank me .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="20">Life 's like a cage ; we beat the bars ,</l>
      <l n="21">We bruise our breasts , we struggle vainly ;</l>
      <l n="22">Up to the glory of the stars</l>
      <l n="23">We strain with flutterings ungainly .</l>
      <l n="24">And then — God opens wide the door ;</l>
      <l n="25">Our wondrous wings are arched for flying ;</l>
      <l n="26">We poise , we part , we sing , we soar . . .</l>

I have had hard times , been hungry , cold , weary . I have worked harder than ever I did and discouragement has slapped me on the face . Yet the year has been the happiest of my life .</p>
   <p>And all because I am free . By reason of filthy money no one can say to me : Do this , or do that . “ Master ” does n't exist in my vocabulary . I can look any man in the face and tell him to go to the devil . I belong to myself . I am not for sale . It 's glorious to feel like that . It sweetens the dry crust and warms the heart in the icy wind . For that I will hunger and go threadbare ; for that I will live austerely and deny myself all pleasure . After health , the best thing in life is freedom .</p>
   <p>Here is the last of my ballads . It is by way of being an experiment . Its theme is commonplace , its language that of everyday . It is a bit of realism in rhyme .</p>
   <p>The Wee Shop</p>

     <l n="1">She risked her all , they told me , bravely sinking</l>
     <l n="2">The pinched economies of thirty years ;</l>
     <l n="3">And there the little shop was , meek and shrinking ,</l>
     <l n="4">The sum of all her dreams and hopes and fears .</l>
     <l n="5">Ere it was opened I would see them in it ,</l>
     <l n="6">The gray-haired dame , the daughter with her crutch ;</l>
     <l n="7">So fond , so happy , hoarding every minute ,</l>
     <l n="8">Like artists , for the final tender touch .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The opening day ! I 'm sure that to their seeming</l>
     <l n="10">Was never shop so wonderful as theirs ;</l>
     <l n="11">With pyramids of jam-jars rubbed to gleaming ;</l>
     <l n="12">Such vivid cans of peaches , prunes and pears ;</l>
     <l n="13">And chocolate , and biscuits in glass cases ,</l>
     <l n="14">And bon-bon bottles , many-hued and bright ;</l>
     <l n="15">Yet nothing half so radiant as their faces ,</l>
     <l n="16">Their eyes of hope , excitement and delight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">I entered : how they waited all a-flutter !</l>
     <l n="18">How awkwardly they weighed my acid-drops !</l>
     <l n="19">And then with all the thanks a tongue could utter</l>
     <l n="20">They bowed me from the kindliest of shops .</l>
     <l n="21">I 'm sure that night their customers they numbered ;</l>
     <l n="22">Discussed them all in happy , breathless speech ;</l>
     <l n="23">And though quite worn and weary , ere they slumbered ,</l>
     <l n="24">Sent heavenward a little prayer for each .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">And so I watched with interest redoubled</l>
     <l n="26">That little shop , spent in it all I had ;</l>
     <l n="27">And when I saw it empty I was troubled ,</l>
     <l n="28">And when I saw them busy I was glad .</l>
     <l n="29">And when I dared to ask how things were going ,</l>
     <l n="30">They told me , with a fine and gallant smile :</l>
     <l n="31">“ Not badly . . . slow at first . . . There 's never knowing . . .</l>
     <l n="32">‘ Twill surely pick up in a little while . ”</l>

     <l n="33">I 'd often see them through the winter weather ,</l>
     <l n="34">Behind the shutters by a light 's faint speck ,</l>
     <l n="35">Poring o'er books , their faces close together ,</l>
     <l n="36">The lame girl 's arm around her mother 's neck .</l>
     <l n="37">They dressed their windows not one time but twenty ,</l>
     <l n="38">Each change more pinched , more desperately neat ;</l>
     <l n="39">Alas ! I wondered if behind that plenty</l>
     <l n="40">The two who owned it had enough to eat .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Ah , who would dare to sing of tea and coffee ?</l>
     <l n="42">The sadness of a stock unsold and dead ;</l>
     <l n="43">The petty tragedy of melting toffee ,</l>
     <l n="44">The sordid pathos of stale gingerbread .</l>
     <l n="45">Ignoble themes ! And yet — those haggard faces !</l>
     <l n="46">Within that little shop . . . . Oh , here I say</l>
     <l n="47">One does not need to look in lofty places</l>
     <l n="48">For tragic themes , they 're round us every day .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">And so I saw their agony , their fighting ,</l>
     <l n="50">Their eyes of fear , their heartbreak , their despair ;</l>
     <l n="51">And there the little shop is , black and blighting ,</l>
     <l n="52">And all the world goes by and does not care .</l>
     <l n="53">They say she sought her old employer 's pity ,</l>
     <l n="54">Content to take the pittance he would give .</l>
     <l n="55">The lame girl ? yes , she 's working in the city ;</l>
     <l n="56">She coughs a lot — she has n't long to live .</l>

   <p>Last night MacBean introduced me to Saxon Dane the Poet . Truly , he is more like a blacksmith than a Bard — a big bearded man whose black eyes brood somberly or flash with sudden fire . We talked of Walt Whitman , and then of others .</p>
   <p>“ The trouble with poetry , ” he said , “ is that it is too exalted . It has a phraseology of its own ; it selects themes that are quite outside of ordinary experience . As a medium of expression it fails to reach the great mass of the people . ”</p>
   <p>Then he added : “ To hell with the great mass of the people ! What have they got to do with it ? Write to please yourself , as if not a single reader existed . The moment a man begins to be conscious of an audience he is artistically damned . You 're not a Poet , I hope ? ”</p>
   <p>I meekly assured him I was a mere maker of verse .</p>
   <p>“ Well , ” said he , “ better good verse than middling poetry . And maybe even the humblest of rhymes has its uses . Happiness is happiness , whether it be inspired by a Rossetti sonnet or a ballad by G. R. Sims . Let each one who has something to say , say it in the best way he can , and abide the result . . . . After all , ” he went on , “ what does it matter ? We are living in a pygmy day . With Tennyson and Browning the line of great poets passed away , perhaps for ever . The world to-day is full of little minstrels , who echo one another and who pipe away tunefully enough . But with one exception they do not matter . ”</p>
   <p>I dared to ask who was his one exception . He answered , “ Myself , of course . ”</p>
   <p>Here 's a bit of light verse which it amused me to write to-day , as I sat in the sun on the terrace of the Closerie de Lilas :</p>
   <p>The Philistine and the Bohemian</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">She was a Philistine spick and span ,</l>
     <l n="2">He was a bold Bohemian .</l>
     <l n="3">She had the mode , and the last at that ;</l>
     <l n="4">He had a cape and a brigand hat .</l>
     <l n="5">She was so riant and chic and trim ;</l>
     <l n="6">He was so shaggy , unkempt and grim .</l>
     <l n="7">On the rue de la Paix she was wont to shine ;</l>
     <l n="8">The rue de la Gaîté was more his line .</l>
     <l n="9">She doted on Barclay and Dell and Caine ;</l>
     <l n="10">He quoted Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine .</l>
     <l n="11">She was a triumph at Tango teas ;</l>
     <l n="12">At Vorticist 's suppers he sought to please .</l>
     <l n="13">She thought that Franz Lehar was utterly great ;</l>
     <l n="14">Of Strauss and Stravinsky he 'd piously prate .</l>
     <l n="15">She loved elegance , he loved art ;</l>
     <l n="16">They were as wide as the poles apart :</l>
     <l n="17">Yet — Cupid and Caprice are hand and glove —</l>
     <l n="18">They met at a dinner , they fell in love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">Home he went to his garret bare ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thrilling with rapture , hope , despair .</l>
     <l n="21">Swift he gazed in his looking-glass ,</l>
     <l n="22">Made a grimace and murmured : “ Ass ! ”</l>
     <l n="23">Seized his scissors and fiercely sheared ,</l>
     <l n="24">Severed his buccaneering beard ;</l>
     <l n="25">Grabbed his hair , and clip ! clip ! clip !</l>
     <l n="26">Off came a bunch with every snip .</l>
     <l n="27">Ran to a tailor 's in startled state ,</l>
     <l n="28">Suits a dozen commanded straight ;</l>
     <l n="29">Coats and overcoats , pants in pairs ,</l>
     <l n="30">Everything that a dandy wears ;</l>
     <l n="31">Socks and collars , and shoes and ties ,</l>
     <l n="32">Everything that a dandy buys .</l>
     <l n="33">Chums looked at him with wondering stare ,</l>
     <l n="34">Fancied they 'd seen him before somewhere ;</l>
     <l n="35">A Brummell , a D'Orsay , a beau so fine ,</l>
     <l n="36">A shining , immaculate Philistine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">Home she went in a raptured daze ,</l>
     <l n="38">Looked in a mirror with startled gaze ,</l>
     <l n="39">Did n't seem to be pleased at all ;</l>
     <l n="40">Savagely muttered : “ Insipid Doll ! ”</l>
     <l n="41">Clutched her hair and a pair of shears ,</l>
     <l n="42">Cropped and bobbed it behind the ears ;</l>
     <l n="43">Aimed at a wan and willowy-necked</l>
     <l n="44">Sort of a Holman Hunt effect ;</l>
     <l n="45">Robed in subtile and sage-green tones ,</l>
     <l n="46">Like the dames of Rossetti and E. Burne-Jones ;</l>
     <l n="47">Girdled her garments billowing wide ,</l>
     <l n="48">Moved with an undulating glide ;</l>
     <l n="49">All her frivolous friends forsook ,</l>
     <l n="50">Cultivated a soulful look ;</l>
     <l n="51">Gushed in a voice with a creamy throb</l>
     <l n="52">Over some weirdly Futurist daub —</l>
     <l n="53">Did all , in short , that a woman can</l>
     <l n="54">To be a consummate Bohemian .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="55">A year went past with its hopes and fears ,</l>
     <l n="56">A year that seemed like a dozen years .</l>
     <l n="57">They met once more . . . . Oh , at last ! At last !</l>
     <l n="58">They rushed together , they stopped aghast .</l>
     <l n="59">They looked at each other with blank dismay ,</l>
     <l n="60">They simply had n't a word to say .</l>
     <l n="61">He thought with a shiver : “ Can this be she ? ”</l>
     <l n="62">She thought with a shudder : “ This can n't be he ? ”</l>
     <l n="63">This simpering dandy , so sleek and spruce ;</l>
     <l n="64">This languorous lily in garments loose ;</l>
     <l n="65">They sought to brace from the awful shock :</l>
     <l n="66">Taking a seat , they tried to talk .</l>
     <l n="67">She spoke of Bergson and Pater 's prose ,</l>
     <l n="68">He prattled of dances and ragtime shows ;</l>
     <l n="69">She purred of pictures , Matisse , Cezanne ,</l>
     <l n="70">His tastes to the girls of Kirchner ran ;</l>
     <l n="71">She raved of Tchaikovsky and Caesar Franck ,</l>
     <l n="72">He owned that he was a jazz-band crank !</l>
     <l n="73">They made no headway . Alas ! alas !</l>
     <l n="74">He thought her a bore , she thought him an ass .</l>
     <l n="75">And so they arose and hurriedly fled ;</l>
     <l n="76">Perish Illusion , Romance , you 're dead .</l>
     <l n="77">He loved elegance , she loved art ,</l>
     <l n="78">Better at once to part , to part .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="79">And what is the moral of all this rot ?</l>
     <l n="80">Do n't try to be what you know you 're not .</l>
     <l n="81">And if you 're made on a muttonish plan ,</l>
     <l n="82">Do n't seek to seem a Bohemian ;</l>
     <l n="83">And if to the goats your feet incline ,</l>
     <l n="84">Do n't try to pass for a Philistine .</l>

   <p>Alas ! it is too true . Once more I am counting the coppers , living on the ragged edge . My manuscripts come back to me like boomerangs , and I have not the postage , far less the heart , to send them out again .</p>
   <p>MacBean seems to take an interest in my struggles . I often sit in his room in the rue Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre , smoking and sipping whisky into the small hours . He is an old hand , who knows the market and frankly manufactures for it .</p>
   <p>“ Give me short pieces , ” he says ; “ things of three verses that will fill a blank half-page of a magazine . Let them be sprightly , and , if possible , have a snapper at the end . Give me that sort of article . I think I can place it for you . ”</p>
   <p>Then he looked through a lot of my verse : “ This is the kind of stuff I might be able to sell , ” he said :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Clorinda met me on the way</l>
     <l n="2">As I came from the train ;</l>
     <l n="3">Her face was anything but gay ,</l>
     <l n="4">In fact , suggested pain .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Oh hubby , hubby dear ! ” she cried ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ I 've awful news to tell . . . . ”</l>
     <l n="7">“ What is it , darling ? ” I replied ;</l>
     <l n="8">“ Your mother — is she well ? ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">“ Oh no ! oh no ! it is not that ,</l>
     <l n="10">It 's something else , ” she wailed ,</l>
     <l n="11">My heart was beating pit-a-pat ,</l>
     <l n="12">My ruddy visage paled .</l>
     <l n="13">Like lightning flash in heaven 's dome</l>
     <l n="14">The fear within me woke :</l>
     <l n="15">“ Do n't say , ” I cried , “ our little home</l>
     <l n="16">Has all gone up in smoke ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">She shook her head . Oh , swift I clasped</l>

     <l n="20">“ Believe me , it is best . ”</l>
     <l n="21">Then , then she spoke ; ‘ mid sobs I caught</l>
     <l n="22">These words of woe divine :</l>
     <l n="23">“ It 's coo-coo-cook has gone and bought</l>
     <l n="24">A new hat just like mine . ”</l>

   <p>At present I am living on bread and milk . By doing this I can rub along for another ten days . The thought pleases me . As long as I have a crust I am master of my destiny . Some day , when I am rich and famous , I shall look back on all this with regret . Yet I think I shall always remain a Bohemian . I hate regularity . The clock was never made for me . I want to eat when I am hungry , sleep when I am weary , drink — well , any old time .</p>
   <p>I prefer to be alone . Company is a constraint on my spirit . I never make an engagement if I can avoid it . To do so is to put a mortgage on my future . I like to be able to rise in the morning with the thought that the hours before me are all mine , to spend in my own way — to work , to dream , to watch the unfolding drama of life .</p>
   <p>Here is another of my ballads . It is longer than most , and gave me more trouble , though none the better for that .</p>

   <p>Or else , sitting on the terrace of a cafe on the Boul ’ Mich ’ , I sip slowly a Dubonnet or a Byrrh , and the charm of the Quarter possesses me .

     <l n="24">The Death of Marie Toro</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="25">We 're taking Marie Toro to her home in Père-La-Chaise ;</l>
     <l n="26">We 're taking Marie Toro to her last resting-place .</l>
     <l n="27">Behold ! her hearse is hung with wreaths till everything is hid</l>
     <l n="28">Except the blossoms heaping high upon her coffin lid .</l>
     <l n="29">A week ago she roamed the street , a draggle and a slut ,</l>
     <l n="30">A by-word of the Boulevard and everybody 's butt ;</l>
     <l n="31">A week ago she haunted us , we heard her whining cry ,</l>
     <l n="32">We brushed aside the broken blooms she pestered us to buy ;</l>
     <l n="33">A week ago she had not where to rest her weary head . . .</l>
     <l n="34">But now , oh , follow , follow on , for Marie Toro 's dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="35">Oh Marie , she was once a queen — ah yes , a queen of queens .</l>
     <l n="36">High-throned above the Carnival she held her splendid sway .</l>
     <l n="37">For four-and-twenty crashing hours she knew what glory means ,</l>
     <l n="38">The cheers of half a million throats , the délire of a day .</l>
     <l n="39">Yet she was only one of us , a little sewing-girl ,</l>
     <l n="40">Though far the loveliest and best of all our laughing band ;</l>
     <l n="41">Then Fortune beckoned ; off she danced , amid the dizzy whirl ,</l>
     <l n="42">And we who once might kiss her cheek were proud to kiss her hand .</l>
     <l n="43">For swiftly as a star she soared ; she had her every wish ;</l>
     <l n="44">We saw her roped with pearls of price , with princes at her call ;</l>
     <l n="45">And yet , and yet I think her dreams were of the old Boul ’ Mich ’ ,</l>
     <l n="46">And yet I 'm sure within her heart she loved us best of all .</l>
     <l n="47">For one night in the Purple Pig , upon the rue Saint-Jacques ,</l>
     <l n="48">We laughed and quaffed . . . a limousine came swishing to the door ;</l>
     <l n="49">Then Raymond Jolicoeur cried out : “ It 's Queen Marie come back ,</l>
     <l n="50">In satin clad to make us glad , and witch our hearts once more . ”</l>
     <l n="51">But no , her face was strangely sad , and at the evening 's end :</l>
     <l n="52">“ Dear lads , ” she said ; “ I love you all , and when I 'm far away ,</l>
     <l n="53">Remember , oh , remember , little Marie is your friend ,</l>
     <l n="54">And though the world may lie between , I 'm coming back some day . ”</l>
     <l n="55">And so she went , and many a boy who 's fought his way to Fame ,</l>
     <l n="56">Can look back on the struggle of his garret days and bless</l>
     <l n="57">The loyal heart , the tender hand , the Providence that came</l>
     <l n="58">To him and all in hour of need , in sickness and distress .</l>
     <l n="59">Time passed away . She won their hearts in London , Moscow , Rome ;</l>
     <l n="60">They worshiped her in Argentine , adored her in Brazil ;</l>
     <l n="61">We smoked our pipes and wondered when she might be coming home ,</l>
     <l n="62">And then we learned the luck had turned , the things were going ill .</l>
     <l n="63">Her health had failed , her beauty paled , her lovers fled away ;</l>
     <l n="64">And some one saw her in Peru , a common drab at last .</l>
     <l n="65">So years went by , and faces changed ; our beards were sadly gray ,</l>
     <l n="66">And Marie Toro 's name became an echo of the past .</l>

     <l n="73">Beneath his mop of grizzled hair his cheeks are gouged with pain ,</l>

     <l n="75">Well , one night in the D'Harcourt ' s din I saw him in his place ,</l>

     <l n="80">“ Too late ! Too late ! . . . they all are dead and gone , ” I heard her say .</l>
     <l n="81">And once again her weary eyes went round and round the room ;</l>
     <l n="82">“ Not one of all I used to know . . . ” she turned to go away . . .</l>
     <l n="83">But quick I saw the old man start : “ Ah no ! ” he cried , “ not all .</l>

     <l n="102">She trailed along with tattered shawl and mud-corroded skirt ;</l>
     <l n="103">She gnawed a crust and slept beneath the bridges of the Seine ,</l>

     <l n="110">One morning early , huddled down , for it was freezing cold ;</l>
     <l n="111">But when they raised her ragged shawl her face was still and sweet ;</l>
     <l n="112">Some bits of broken bloom were clutched within her icy hold .</l>
     <l n="113">That 's all . . . . Ah yes , they say that saw : her blue , wide-open eyes</l>

   <p>Hurrah ! The crisis in my financial career is over . Once more I have weathered the storm , and never did money jingle so sweetly in my pocket . It was MacBean who delivered me . He arrived at the door of my garret this morning , with a broad grin of pleasure on his face .</p>
   <p>“ Here , ” said he ; “ I 've sold some of your rubbish . They 'll take more too , of the same sort . ”</p>
   <p>With that he handed me three crisp notes . For a moment I thought that he was paying the money out of his own pocket , as he knew I was desperately hard up ; but he showed me the letter enclosing the cheque he had cashed for me .</p>
   <p>So we sought the Grand Boulevard , and I had a Pernod , which rose to my head in delicious waves of joy . I talked ecstatic nonsense , and seemed to walk like a god in clouds of gold . We dined on frogs ’ legs and Vouvray , and then went to see the Revue at the Marigny . A very merry evening .</p>
   <p>Such is the life of Bohemia , up and down , fast and feast ; its very uncertainty its charm .</p>
   <p>Here is my latest ballad , another attempt to express the sentiment of actuality :</p>
   <p>The Auction Sale</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Her little head just topped the window-sill ;</l>
     <l n="2">She even mounted on a stool , maybe ;</l>
     <l n="3">She pressed against the pane , as children will ,</l>
     <l n="4">And watched us playing , oh so wistfully !</l>
     <l n="5">And then I missed her for a month or more ,</l>
     <l n="6">And idly thought : “ She 's gone away , no doubt , ”</l>
     <l n="7">Until a hearse drew up beside the door . . .</l>
     <l n="8">I saw a tiny coffin carried out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">And after that , towards dusk I 'd often see</l>
     <l n="10">Behind the blind another face that looked :</l>
     <l n="11">Eyes of a young wife watching anxiously ,</l>
     <l n="12">Then rushing back to where her dinner cooked .</l>
     <l n="13">She often gulped it down alone , I fear ,</l>
     <l n="14">Within her heart the sadness of despair ,</l>
     <l n="15">For near to midnight I would vaguely hear</l>
     <l n="16">A lurching step , a stumbling on the stair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">These little dramas of the common day !</l>
     <l n="18">A man weak-willed and fore-ordained to fail . . .</l>
     <l n="19">The window 's empty now , they 've gone away ,</l>
     <l n="20">And yonder , see , their furniture 's for sale .</l>
     <l n="21">To all the world their door is open wide ,</l>
     <l n="22">And round and round the bargain-hunters roam ,</l>
     <l n="23">And peer and gloat , like vultures avid-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="24">Above the corpse of what was once a home .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">So reverent I go from room to room ,</l>

     <l n="28">The woman-courage tested overmuch .</l>
     <l n="29">Amid those things so intimate and dear ,</l>
     <l n="30">Where now the mob invades with brutal tread ,</l>
     <l n="31">I think : “ What happiness is buried here ,</l>
     <l n="32">What dreams are withered and what hopes are dead ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Oh , woman dear , and were you sweet and glad</l>
     <l n="34">Over the lining of your little nest !</l>
     <l n="35">What ponderings and proud ideas you had !</l>
     <l n="36">What visions of a shrine of peace and rest !</l>
     <l n="37">For there 's his easy-chair upon the rug ,</l>
     <l n="38">His reading-lamp , his pipe-rack on the wall ,</l>
     <l n="39">All that you could devise to make him snug —</l>

     <l n="44">When you had time , before the baby came .</l>
     <l n="45">Oh , how you wove around him cozy spells ,</l>
     <l n="46">And schemed so hard to keep him home of nights !</l>
     <l n="47">Aye , every touch and turn some story tells</l>
     <l n="48">Of sweet conspiracies and dead delights .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">And here upon the scratched piano stool ,</l>
     <l n="50">Tied in a bundle , are the songs you sung ;</l>
     <l n="51">That cozy that you worked in colored wool ,</l>
     <l n="52">The Spanish lace you made when you were young ,</l>
     <l n="53">And lots of modern novels , cheap reprints ,</l>
     <l n="54">And little dainty knick-knacks everywhere ;</l>
     <l n="55">And silken bows and curtains of gay chintz . . .</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">Sweet woman dear , and did your heart not break ,</l>
     <l n="58">To leave this precious home you made in vain ?</l>
     <l n="59">Poor shabby things ! so prized for old times ’ sake ,</l>
     <l n="60">With all their memories of love and pain .</l>
     <l n="61">Alas ! while shouts the raucous auctioneer ,</l>
     <l n="62">And rat-faced dames are prying everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="63">The echo of old joy is all I hear ,</l>
     <l n="64">All , all I see just heartbreak and despair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">Imagination is the great gift of the gods . Given it , one does not need</l>
     <l n="66">to look afar for subjects . There is romance in every face .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Those who have Imagination live in a land of enchantment which the eyes of others cannot see . Yet if it brings marvelous joy it also brings exquisite pain . Who lives a hundred lives must die a hundred deaths .</p>
   <p>I do not know any of the people who live around me . Sometimes I pass them on the stairs . However , I am going to give my imagination rein , and string some rhymes about them .</p>
   <p>Before doing so , having money in my pocket and seeing the prospect of making more , let me blithely chant about .</p>

   <p>MacBean , before he settled down to the manufacture of mercantile fiction , had ideas of a nobler sort , which bore their fruit in a slender book of poems . In subject they are either erotic , mythologic , or descriptive of nature . So polished are they that the mind seems to slide over them : so faultless in form that the critics hailed them with highest praise , and as many as a hundred copies were sold .</p>
   <p>Saxon Dane , too , has published a book of poems , but he , on the other hand , defies tradition to an eccentric degree . Originality is his sin . He strains after it in every line . I must confess I think much of the free verse he writes is really prose , and a good deal of it blank verse chopped up into odd lengths . He talks of assonance and color , of stress and pause and accent , and bewilders me with his theories .</p>
   <p>He and MacBean represent two extremes , and at night , as we sit in the Cafe du Dôme , they have the hottest of arguments . As for me , I listen with awe , content that my medium is verse , and that the fashions of Hood , Thackeray and Bret Harte are the fashions of to-day .</p>
   <p>Of late I have been doing light stuff , “ fillers ” for MacBean . Here are three of my specimens :</p>

     <l n="12">At the risk of upsetting our little boat ?</l>

   <p>Talking about writing books , there is a queer character who shuffles up and down the little streets that neighbor the Place Maubert , and who , they say , has been engaged on one for years . Sometimes I see him cowering in some cheap bouge , and his wild eyes gleam at me through the tangle of his hair . But I do not think he ever sees me . He mumbles to himself , and moves like a man in a dream . His pockets are full of filthy paper on which he writes from time to time . The students laugh at him and make him tipsy ; the street boys pelt him with ordure ; the better cafes turn him from their doors . But who knows ? At least , this is how I see him :</p>

     <l n="4">And wake up whiter than a spook ;</l>

   <p>How charming it is , this Paris of the summer skies ! Each morning I leap up with joy in my heart , all eager to begin the day of work . As I eat my breakfast and smoke my pipe , I ponder over my task . Then in the golden sunshine that floods my little attic I pace up and down , absorbed and forgetful of the world . As I compose I speak the words aloud . There are difficulties to overcome ; thoughts that will not fit their mold ; rebellious rhymes . Ah ! those moments of despair and defeat .</p>
   <p>Then suddenly the mind grows lucid , imagination glows , the snarl unravels . In the end is always triumph and success . O delectable métier ! Who would not be a rhymesmith in Paris , in Bohemia , in the heart of youth !</p>
   <p>I have now finished my twentieth ballad . Five more and they will be done . In quiet corners of cafes , on benches of the Luxembourg , on the sunny Quays I read them over one by one . Here is my latest :</p>

     <l n="12">( God save each little drowsy head ! )</l>

      <l n="82">Late July 1914 .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>When on some scintillating summer morning I leap lightly up to the seclusion of my garret , I often think of those lines : “ In the brave days when I was twenty-one . ”</p>
   <p>True , I have no loving , kind Lisette to pin her petticoat across the pane , yet I do live in hope . Am I not in Bohemia the Magical , Bohemia of Murger , of de Musset , of Verlaine ? Shades of Mimi Pinson , of Trilby , of all that immortal line of laughterful grisettes , do not tell me that the days of love and fun are forever at an end !</p>
   <p>Yes , youth is golden , but what of age ? Shall it too not testify to the rhapsody of existence ? Let the years between be those of struggle , of sufferance — of disillusion if you will ; but let youth and age affirm the ecstasy of being . Let us look forward all to a serene sunset , and in the still skies “ a late lark singing ” .</p>
   <p>This thought comes to me as , sitting on a bench near the band-stand , I see an old savant who talks to all the children . His clean-shaven face is alive with kindliness ; under his tall silk hat his white hair falls to his shoulders . He wears a long black cape over a black frock-coat , very neat linen , and a flowing tie of black silk . I call him “ Silvester Bonnard ” . As I look at him I truly think the best of life are the years between sixty and seventy .</p>
   <p>A Song of Sixty-Five</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Brave Thackeray has trolled of days when he was twenty-one ,</l>

   <p>From old men to children is but a step , and there too , in the shadow of the Fontaine de Medicis , I spend much of my time watching the little ones . Childhood , so innocent , so helpless , so trusting , is somehow pathetic to me .</p>
   <p>There was one jolly little chap who used to play with a large white Teddy Bear . He was always with his mother , a sweet-faced woman , who followed his every movement with delight . I used to watch them both , and often spoke a few words .</p>
   <p>Then one day I missed them , and it struck me I had not seen them for a week , even a month , maybe . After that I looked for them a time or two and soon forgot .</p>
   <p>Then this morning I saw the mother in the rue D'Assas . She was alone and in deep black . I wanted to ask after the boy , but there was a look in her face that stopped me .</p>
   <p>I do not think she will ever enter the garden of the Luxembourg again .</p>

   <p>After old men and children I am greatly interested in dogs . I will go out of my way to caress one who shows any desire to be friendly . There is a very filthy fellow who collects cigarette stubs on the Boul ’ Mich ’ , and who is always followed by a starved yellow cur . The other day I came across them in a little side street . The man was stretched on the pavement brutishly drunk and dead to the world . The dog , lying by his side , seemed to look at me with sad , imploring eyes . Though all the world despise that man , I thought , this poor brute loves him and will be faithful unto death .</p>
   <p>From this incident I wrote the verses that follow :</p>

   <p>I take my exercise in the form of walking . It keeps me fit and leaves me free to think . In this way I have come to know Paris like my pocket . I have explored its large and little streets , its stateliness and its slums .</p>
   <p>But most of all I love the Quays , between the leafage and the sunlit Seine . Like shuttles the little steamers dart up and down , weaving the water into patterns of foam . Cigar-shaped barges stream under the lacework of the many bridges and make me think of tranquil days and willow-fringed horizons .</p>
   <p>But what I love most is the stealing in of night , when the sky takes on that strange elusive purple ; when eyes turn to the evening star and marvel at its brightness ; when the Eiffel Tower becomes a strange , shadowy stairway yearning in impotent effort to the careless moon .</p>
   <p>Here is my latest ballad , short if not very sweet :</p>

     <l n="6">Apples for the cider-press , ruby-hued and gold ;</l>
     <l n="7">Tails of rabbits twinkling , scarlet berries burning ,</l>
     <l n="8">Wedge of geese high-flying in the sky 's clear cold ,</l>

     <l n="10">Home again returning , hungry as a hawk ;</l>

      <l n="27">Late in July 1914 .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="28">The other evening MacBean was in a pessimistic mood .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="29">“ Why do you write ? ” he asked me gloomily .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="30">“ Obviously , ” I said , “ to avoid starving . To produce something that will</l>
      <l n="31">buy me food , shelter , raiment . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="32">“ If you were a millionaire , would you still write ? ”</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Yes , ” I said , after a moment 's thought . “ You get an idea . It haunts you . It seems to clamor for expression . It begins to obsess you . At last in desperation you embody it in a poem , an essay , a story . There ! it is disposed of . You are at rest . It troubles you no more . Yes ; if I were a millionaire I should write , if it were only to escape from my ideas . ”</p>
   <p>“ You have given two reasons why men write , ” said MacBean : “ for gain , for self-expression . Then , again , some men write to amuse themselves , some because they conceive they have a mission in the world ; some because they have real genius , and are conscious they can enrich the literature of all time . I must say I do n't know of any belonging to the latter class . We are living in an age of mediocrity . There is no writer of to-day who will be read twenty years after he is dead . That 's a truth that must come home to the best of them . ”</p>
   <p>“ I guess they 're not losing much sleep over it , ” I said .</p>
   <p>“ Take novelists , ” continued MacBean . “ The line of first-class novelists ended with Dickens and Thackeray . Then followed some of the second class , Stevenson , Meredith , Hardy . And to-day we have three novelists of the third class , good , capable craftsmen . We can trust ourselves comfortably in their hands . We read and enjoy them , but do you think our children will ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Yours wo n't , anyway , ” I said .</p>
   <p>“ Do n't be too sure . I may surprise you yet . I may get married and turn bourgeois . ”</p>
   <p>The best thing that could happen to MacBean would be that . It might change his point of view . He is so painfully discouraging . I have never mentioned my ballads to him . He would be sure to throw cold water on them . And as it draws near to its end the thought of my book grows more and more dear to me . How I will get it published I know not ; but I will . Then even if it does n't sell , even if nobody reads it , I will be content . Out of this brief , perishable Me I will have made something concrete , something that will preserve my thought within its dusty covers long after I am dead and dust .</p>
   <p>Here is one of my latest :</p>

     <l n="13">You 'd think the words of praise I spoke</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>On the terrace of the Closerie de Lilas I came on Saxon Dane . He was smoking his big briar and drinking a huge glass of brown beer . The tree gave a pleasant shade , and he had thrown his sombrero on a chair . I noted how his high brow was bronzed by the sun and there were golden lights in his broad beard . There was something massive and imposing in the man as he sat there in brooding thought .</p>
   <p>MacBean , he told me , was sick and unable to leave his room . Rheumatism . So I bought a cooked chicken and a bottle of Barsac , and mounting to the apartment of the invalid , I made him eat and drink . MacBean was very despondent , but cheered up greatly .</p>
   <p>I think he rather dreads the future . He cannot save money , and all he makes he spends . He has always been a rover , often tried to settle down but could not . Now I think he wishes for security . I fear , however , it is too late .</p>

     <l n="1">I sought the trails of South and North ,</l>

     <l n="4">And would not let me rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And still I seek , as still I roam ,</l>

   <p>MacBean is one of Bohemia 's victims . It is a country of the young . The old have no place in it . He will gradually lose his grip , go down and down . I am sorry . He is my nearest approach to a friend . I do not make them easily . I have deep reserves . I like solitude . I am never so surrounded by boon companions as when I am all alone .</p>
   <p>But though I am a solitary I realize the beauty of friendship , and on looking through my note-book I find the following :</p>
   <p>If You Had a Friend</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">If you had a friend strong , simple , true ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who knew your faults and who understood ;</l>
     <l n="3">Who believed in the very best of you ,</l>
     <l n="4">And who cared for you as a father would ;</l>
     <l n="5">Who would stick by you to the very end ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who would smile however the world might frown :</l>
     <l n="7">I 'm sure you would try to please your friend ,</l>
     <l n="8">You never would think to throw him down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">And supposing your friend was high and great ,</l>
     <l n="10">And he lived in a palace rich and tall ,</l>
     <l n="11">And sat like a King in shining state ,</l>
     <l n="12">And his praise was loud on the lips of all ;</l>
     <l n="13">Well then , when he turned to you alone ,</l>
     <l n="14">And he singled you out from all the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="15">And he called you up to his golden throne ,</l>
     <l n="16">Oh , would n't you just be jolly proud ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">If you had a friend like this , I say ,</l>
     <l n="18">So sweet and tender , so strong and true ,</l>
     <l n="19">You 'd try to please him in every way ,</l>
     <l n="20">You 'd live at your bravest — now , would n't you ?</l>
     <l n="21">His worth would shine in the words you penned ;</l>
     <l n="22">You 'd shout his praises . . . yet now it 's odd !</l>
     <l n="23">You tell me you have n't got such a friend ;</l>
     <l n="24">You have n't ? I wonder . . . What of God ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>To how few is granted the privilege of doing the work which lies closest to the heart , the work for which one is best fitted . The happy man is he who knows his limitations , yet bows to no false gods .</p>
   <p>MacBean is not happy . He is overridden by his appetites , and to satisfy them he writes stuff that in his heart he despises .</p>
   <p>Saxon Dane is not happy . His dream exceeds his grasp . His twisted , tortured phrases mock the vague grandiosity of his visions .</p>
   <p>I am happy . My talent is proportioned to my ambition . The things I like to write are the things I like to read . I prefer the lesser poets to the greater , the cackle of the barnyard fowl to the scream of the eagle . I lack the divinity of discontent .</p>
   <p>True Contentment comes from within . It dominates circumstance . It is resignation wedded to philosophy , a Christian quality seldom attained except by the old .</p>

   <p>Paris and I are out of tune . As I sit at this famous corner the faint breeze is stale and weary ; stale and weary too the faces that swirl around me ; while overhead the electric sign of Somebody 's Chocolate appears and vanishes with irritating insistency . The very trees seem artificial , gleaming under the arc-lights with a raw virility that rasps my nerves .</p>
   <p>“ Poor little trees , ” I mutter , “ growing in all this grime and glare , your only dryads the loitering ladies with the complexions of such brilliant certainty , your only Pipes of Pan orchestral echoes from the clamorous cafes . Exiles of the forest ! what know you of full-blossomed winds , of red-embered sunsets , of the gentle admonition of spring rain ! Life , that would fain be a melody , seems here almost a malady . I crave for the balm of Nature , the anodyne of solitude , the breath of Mother Earth . Tell me , O wistful trees , what shall I do ? ”</p>
   <p>Then that stale and weary wind rustles the leaves of the nearest sycamore , and I am sure it whispers : “ Brittany . ”</p>

   <p>Behold me with staff and scrip , footing it merrily in the Land of Pardons . I have no goal . When I am weary I stop at some auberge ; when I am rested I go on again . Neither do I put any constraint on my spirit . No subduing of the mind to the task of the moment . I dream to heart 's content .</p>
   <p>My dreams stretch into the future . I see myself a singer of simple songs , a laureate of the under-dog . I will write books , a score of them . I will voyage far and wide . I will . . .</p>
   <p>But there ! Dreams are dangerous . They waste the time one should spend in making them come true . Yet when we do make them come true , we find the vision sweeter than the reality . How much of our happiness do we owe to dreams ? I have in mind one old chap who used to herd the sheep on my uncle 's farm .</p>

   <p>Framed in hedgerows of emerald , the wheat glows with a caloric fervor , as if gorged with summer heat . In the vivid green of pastures old women are herding cows . Calm and patient are their faces as with gentle industry they bend over their knitting . One feels that they are necessary to the landscape .</p>
   <p>To gaze at me the field-workers suspend the magnificent lethargy of their labors . The men with the reaping hooks improve the occasion by another pull at the cider bottle under the stook ; the women raise apathetic brown faces from the sheaf they are tying ; every one is a study in deliberation , though the crop is russet ripe and crying to be cut .</p>
   <p>Then on I go again amid high banks overgrown with fern and honeysuckle . Sometimes I come on an old mill that seems to have been constructed by Constable , so charmingly does Nature imitate Art . By the deserted house , half drowned in greenery , the velvety wheel , dipping in the crystal water , seems to protest against this prolongation of its toil .</p>
   <p>Then again I come on its brother , the Mill of the Wind , whirling its arms so cheerily , as it turns its great white stones for its master , the floury miller by the door .</p>
   <p>These things delight me . I am in a land where Time has lagged , where simple people timorously hug the Past . How far away now seems the welter and swelter of the city , the hectic sophistication of the streets . The sense of wonder is strong in me again , the joy of looking at familiar things as if one were seeing them for the first time .</p>

   <p>For some time the way has been growing wilder . Thickset hedges have yielded to dykes of stone , and there is every sign that I am approaching the rugged region of the coast . At each point of vantage I can see a Cross , often a relic of the early Christians , stumpy and corroded . Then I come on a slab of gray stone upstanding about fifteen feet . Like a sentinel on that solitary plain it overwhelms me with a sense of mystery .</p>
   <p>But as I go on through this desolate land these stones become more and more familiar . Like soldiers they stand in rank , extending over the moor . The sky is cowled with cloud , save where a sullen sunset shoots blood-red rays across the plain . Bathed in that sinister light stands my army of stone , and a wind swooping down seems to wail amid its ranks . As in a glass darkly I can see the skin-clad men , the women with their tangled hair , the beast-like feast , the cowering terror of the night . Then the sunset is cut off suddenly , and a clammy mist shrouds that silent army . So it is almost with a shudder I take my last look at the Stones of Carnac .</p>
   <p>But now my pilgrimage is drawing to an end . A painter friend who lives by the sea has asked me to stay with him awhile . Well , I have walked a hundred miles , singing on the way . I have dreamed and dawdled , planned , exulted . I have drunk buckets of cider , and eaten many an omelette that seemed like a golden glorification of its egg . It has all been very sweet , but it will also be sweet to loaf awhile .</p>

   <p>I am living in a little house so near the sea that at high tide I can see on my bedroom wall the reflected ripple of the water . At night I waken to the melodious welter of waves ; or maybe there is a great stillness , and then I know that the sand and sea-grass are lying naked to the moon . But soon the tide returns , and once more I hear the roistering of the waves .</p>
   <p>Calvert , my friend , is a lover as well as a painter of nature . He rises with the dawn to see the morning mist kindle to coral and the sun 's edge clear the hill-crest . As he munches his coarse bread and sips his white wine , what dreams are his beneath the magic changes of the sky ! He will paint the same scene under a dozen conditions of light . He has looked so long for Beauty that he has come to see it everywhere .</p>
   <p>I love this friendly home of his . A peace steals over my spirit , and I feel as if I could stay here always . Some day I hope that I too may have such an one , and that I may write like this :</p>

   <p>Calvert tries to paint more than the thing he sees ; he tries to paint behind it , to express its spirit . He believes that Beauty is God made manifest , and that when we discover Him in Nature we discover Him in ourselves .</p>
   <p>But Calvert did not always see thus . At one time he was a Pagan , content to paint the outward aspect of things . It was after his little child died he gained in vision . Maybe the thought that the dead are lost to us was too unbearable . He had to believe in a coming together again .</p>
   <p>The Quest</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I sought Him on the purple seas ,</l>
     <l n="2">I sought Him on the peaks aflame ;</l>
     <l n="3">Amid the gloom of giant trees</l>
     <l n="4">And canyons lone I called His name ;</l>
     <l n="5">The wasted ways of earth I trod :</l>
     <l n="6">In vain ! In vain ! I found not God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">I sought Him in the hives of men ,</l>
     <l n="8">The cities grand , the hamlets gray ,</l>
     <l n="9">The temples old beyond my ken ,</l>
     <l n="10">The tabernacles of to-day ;</l>
     <l n="11">All life that is , from cloud to clod</l>
     <l n="12">I sought . . . . Alas ! I found not God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Then after roamings far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="14">In streets and seas and deserts wild ,</l>
     <l n="15">I came to stand at last beside</l>
     <l n="16">The death-bed of my little child .</l>
     <l n="17">Lo ! as I bent beneath the rod</l>
     <l n="18">I raised my eyes . . . and there was God .</l>

   <p>A golden mile of sand swings hammock-like between two tusks of rock . The sea is sleeping sapphire that wakes to cream and crash upon the beach . There is a majesty in the detachment of its lazy waves , and it is good in the night to hear its friendly roar . Good , too , to leap forth with the first sunshine and fall into its arms , to let it pummel the body to living ecstasy and send one to breakfast glad-eyed and glowing .</p>
   <p>Behind the house the greensward slopes to a wheat-field that is like a wall of gold . Here I lie and laze away the time , or dip into a favorite book , Stevenson 's Letters or Belloc 's Path to Rome . Bees drone in the wild thyme ; a cuckoo keeps calling , a lark spills jeweled melody . Then there is a seeming silence , but it is the silence of a deeper sound .</p>
   <p>After all , Silence is only man 's confession of his deafness . Like Death , like Eternity , it is a word that means nothing . So lying there I hear the breathing of the trees , the crepitation of the growing grass , the seething of the sap and the movements of innumerable insects . Strange how I think with distaste of the spurious glitter of Paris , of my garret , even of my poor little book .</p>
   <p>I watch the wife of my friend gathering poppies in the wheat . There is a sadness in her face , for it is only a year ago they lost their little one . Often I see her steal away to the village graveyard , sitting silent for long and long .</p>

   <p>And now I fear I must write in another strain . Up to this time I have been too happy . I have existed in a magic Bohemia , largely of my own making . Hope , faith , enthusiasm have been mine . Each day has had its struggle , its failure , its triumph . However , that is all ended . During the past week we have lived breathlessly . For in spite of the exultant sunshine our spirits have been under a cloud , a deepening shadow of horror and calamity . . . . WAR .</p>
   <p>Even as I write , in our little village steeple the bells are ringing madly , and in every little village steeple all over the land . As he hears it the harvester checks his scythe on the swing ; the clerk throws down his pen ; the shopkeeper puts up his shutters . Only in the cafes there is a clamor of voices and a drowning of care .</p>
   <p>For here every man must fight , every home give tribute . There is no question , no appeal . By heredity and discipline all minds are shaped to this great hour . So to-morrow each man will seek his barracks and become a soldier as completely as if he had never been anything else . With the same docility as he dons his baggy red trousers will he let some muddle-headed General hurl him to destruction for some dubious gain . To-day a father , a home-maker ; to-morrow fodder for cannon . So they all go without hesitation , without bitterness ; and the great military machine that knows not humanity swings them to their fate . I marvel at the sense of duty , the resignation , the sacrifice . It is magnificent , it is FRANCE .</p>
   <p>And the Women . Those who wait and weep . Ah ! to-day I have not seen one who did not weep . Yes , one . She was very old , and she stood by her garden gate with her hand on the uplifted latch . As I passed she looked at me with eyes that did not see . She had no doubt sons and grandsons who must fight , and she had good reason , perhaps , to remember the war of soixante-dix . When I passed an hour later she was still there , her hand on the uplifted latch .</p>
   <p>August 30th .</p>
   <p>The men have gone . Only remain graybeards , women and children . Calvert and I have been helping our neighbors to get in the harvest . No doubt we aid ; but there with the old men and children a sense of uneasiness and even shame comes over me . I would like to return to Paris , but the railway is mobilized . Each day I grow more discontented . Up there in the red North great things are doing and I am out of it . I am thoroughly unhappy .</p>
   <p>Then Calvert comes to me with a plan . He has a Ford car . We will all three go to Paris . He intends to offer himself and his car to the Red Cross . His wife will nurse . So we are very happy at the solution , and to-morrow we are off .</p>
   <p>Paris .</p>
   <p>Back again . Closed shutters , deserted streets . How glum everything is ! Those who are not mobilized seem uncertain how to turn . Every one buys the papers and reads grimly of disaster . No news is bad news .</p>
   <p>I go to my garret as to a beloved friend . Everything is just as I left it , so that it seems I have never been away . I sigh with relief and joy . I will take up my work again . Serene above the storm I will watch and wait . Although I have been brought up in England I am American born . My country is not concerned .</p>
   <p>So , going to the Dôme Cafe , I seek some of my comrades . Strange ! They have gone . MacBean , I am told , is in England . By dyeing his hair and lying about his age he has managed to enlist in the Seaforth Highlanders . Saxon Dane too . He has joined the Foreign Legion , and even now may be fighting .</p>
   <p>Well , let them go . I will keep out of the mess . But why did they go ? I wish I knew . War is murder . Criminal folly . Against Humanity . Imperialism is at the root of it . We are fools and dupes . Yes , I will think and write of other things . . . .</p>
   <p>MacBean has enlisted .</p>
   <p>I hate violence . I would not willingly cause pain to anything breathing . I would rather be killed than kill . I will stand above the Battle and watch it from afar .</p>
   <p>Dane is in the Foreign Legion .</p>
   <p>How disturbing it all is ! One cannot settle down to anything . Every day I meet men who tell the most wonderful stories in the most casual way . I envy them . I too want to have experiences , to live where life 's beat is most intense . But that 's a poor reason for going to war .</p>
   <p>And yet , though I shrink from the idea of fighting , I might in some way help those who are . MacBean and Dane , for example . Sitting lonely in the Dôme , I seem to see their ghosts in the corner . MacBean listening with his keen , sarcastic smile , Saxon Dane banging his great hairy fist on the table till the glasses jump . Where are they now ? Living a life that I will never know . When they come back , if they ever do , shall I not feel shamed in their presence ? Oh , this filthy war ! Things were going on so beautifully . We were all so happy , so full of ambition , of hope ; laughing and talking over pipe and bowl , and in our garrets seeking to realize our dreams . Ah , these days will never come again !</p>
   <p>Then , as I sit there , Calvert seeks me out . He has joined an ambulance corps that is going to the Front . Will I come in ?</p>
   <p>“ Yes , ” I say ; “ I 'll do anything . ”</p>
   <p>So it is all settled . To-morrow I give up my freedom .</p>

      <l n="1">The Somme Front , January 1915 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There is an avenue of noble beeches leading to the Chateau , and in the shadow of each glimmers the pale oblong of an ambulance . We have to keep them thus concealed , for only yesterday morning a Taube flew over . The beggars are rather partial to Red Cross cars . One of our chaps , taking in a load of wounded , was chased and pelted the other day .</p>
   <p>The Chateau seems all spires and towers , the glorified dream of a Parisian pastrycook . On its terrace figures in khaki are lounging . They are the volunteers , the owner-drivers of the Corps , many of them men of wealth and title . Curious to see one who owns all the coal in two counties proudly signing for his sou a day ; or another , who lives in a Fifth Avenue palace , contentedly sleeping on the straw-strewn floor of a hovel .</p>
   <p>Here is a rhyme I have made of such an one :</p>

     <l n="9">“ Little Priscilla ” he called his car ,</l>
     <l n="10">Best of our battered bunch by far ,</l>

     <l n="12">Yet running so sweet and true .</l>
     <l n="13">Jerry he loved her , knew her tricks ;</l>
     <l n="14">Swore : “ She 's the beat of the best big six ,</l>

     <l n="20">To show ‘ em what we can do . ”</l>
     <l n="21">Seemed that Priscilla just took the word ;</l>
     <l n="22">Up with a leap like a horse that 's spurred ,</l>
     <l n="23">On with the joy of a homing bird ,</l>

     <l n="28">Eyes that glare through the dark .</l>
     <l n="29">“ Priscilla , you 're doing me proud this day ;</l>
     <l n="30">Hospital 's only a league away ,</l>
     <l n="31">And , honey , I 'm longing to hit the hay ,</l>

     <l n="41">Again it seems that Priscilla hears .</l>
     <l n="42">With a rush and a roar her way she clears ,</l>
     <l n="43">Straight at the hell of flame she steers ,</l>
     <l n="44">Full at its heart of wrath .</l>
     <l n="45">Fury of death and dust and din !</l>
     <l n="46">Havoc and horror ! She 's in , she 's in ;</l>
     <l n="47">She 's almost over , she 'll win , she 'll win !</l>

     <l n="52">Shriek from the car : “ Mon Dieu ! ”</l>
     <l n="53">One of the blessés hears him say ,</l>
     <l n="54">Just at the moment he faints away :</l>

   <p>The uptilted country-side is a checker-board of green and gray , and , except where groves of trees rise like islands , cultivated to the last acre . But as we near the firing-line all efforts to till the land cease , and the ungathered beets of last year have grown to seed . Amid rank unkempt fields I race over a road that is pitted with obus-holes ; I pass a line of guns painted like snakes , and drawn by horses dyed khaki - color ; then soldiers coming from the trenches , mud-caked and ineffably weary ; then a race over a bit of road that is exposed ; then , buried in the hill-side , the dressing station .</p>
   <p>The two wounded are put into my car . From hip to heel one is swathed in bandages ; the other has a great white turban on his head , with a red patch on it that spreads and spreads . They stare dully , but make no sound . As I crank the car there is a shrill screaming noise . . . . About thirty yards away I hear an explosion like a mine-blast , followed by a sudden belch of coal-black smoke . I stare at it in a dazed way . Then the doctor says : “ Do n't trouble to analyze your sensations . Better get off . You 're only drawing their fire . ”</p>
   <p>Here is one of my experiences :</p>
   <p>A Casualty</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">That boy I took in the car last night ,</l>
     <l n="2">With the body that awfully sagged away ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the lips blood-crisped , and the eyes flame-bright ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the poor hands folded and cold as clay —</l>
     <l n="5">Oh , I 've thought and I 've thought of him all the day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">For the weary old doctor says to me :</l>
     <l n="7">“ He 'll only last for an hour or so .</l>
     <l n="8">Both of his legs below the knee</l>
     <l n="9">Blown off by a bomb . . . . So , lad , go slow ,</l>
     <l n="10">And please remember , he does n't know . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">So I tried to drive with never a jar ;</l>
     <l n="12">And there was I cursing the road like mad ,</l>
     <l n="13">When I hears a ghost of a voice from the car :</l>
     <l n="14">“ Tell me , old chap , have I ‘ copped it ’ bad ? ”</l>
     <l n="15">So I answers “ No , ” and he says , “ I 'm glad . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">“ Glad , ” says he , “ for at twenty-two</l>
     <l n="17">Life 's so splendid , I hate to go .</l>
     <l n="18">There 's so much good that a chap might do ,</l>
     <l n="19">And I 've fought from the start and I 've suffered so .</l>
     <l n="20">‘ Twould be hard to get knocked out now , you know . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">“ Forget it , ” says I ; then I drove awhile ,</l>
     <l n="22">And I passed him a cheery word or two ;</l>
     <l n="23">But he did n't answer for many a mile ,</l>
     <l n="24">So just as the hospital hove in view ,</l>
     <l n="25">Says I : “ Is there nothing that I can do ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">Then he opens his eyes and he smiles at me ;</l>
     <l n="27">And he takes my hand in his trembling hold ;</l>
     <l n="28">“ Thank you — you 're far too kind , ” says he :</l>
     <l n="29">“ I 'm awfully comfy — stay . . . let 's see :</l>
     <l n="30">I fancy my blanket 's come unrolled —</l>
     <l n="31">My feet , please wrap ‘ em — they 're cold . . . they 're cold . ”</l>

   <p>There is a city that glitters on the plain . Afar off we can see its tall cathedral spire , and there we often take our wounded from the little village hospitals to the rail-head . Tragic little buildings , these emergency hospitals — town-halls , churches , schools ; their cots are never empty , their surgeons never still .</p>
   <p>So every day we get our list of cases and off we go , a long line of cars swishing through the mud . Then one by one we branch off to our village hospital , puzzling out the road on our maps . Arrived there , we load up quickly .</p>
   <p>The wounded make no moan . They lie , limp , heavily bandaged , with bare legs and arms protruding from their blankets . They do not know where they are going ; they do not care . Like live stock , they are labeled and numbered . An orderly brings along their battle-scarred equipment , throwing open their rifles to see that no charge remains . Sometimes they shake our hands and thank us for the drive .</p>
   <p>In the streets of the city I see French soldiers wearing the Fourragère . It is a cord of green , yellow or red , and corresponds to the Croix de Guerre , the Médaille militaire and the Legion of Honor . The red is the highest of all , and has been granted only to one or two regiments . This incident was told to me by a man who saw it :</p>
   <p>The Blood-Red Fourragère</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">What was the blackest sight to me</l>
     <l n="2">Of all that campaign ?</l>
     <l n="3">A naked woman tied to a tree</l>
     <l n="4">With jagged holes where her breasts should be ,</l>
     <l n="5">Rotting there in the rain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">On we pressed to the battle fray ,</l>
     <l n="7">Dogged and dour and spent .</l>
     <l n="8">Sudden I heard my Captain say :</l>
     <l n="9">“ Voilà ! Kultur has passed this way ,</l>
     <l n="10">And left us a monument . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">So I looked and I saw our Colonel there ,</l>
     <l n="12">And his grand head , snowed with the years ,</l>
     <l n="13">Unto the beat of the rain was bare ;</l>
     <l n="14">And , oh , there was grief in his frozen stare ,</l>
     <l n="15">And his cheeks were stung with tears !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">Then at last he turned from the woeful tree ,</l>
     <l n="17">And his face like stone was set ;</l>
     <l n="18">“ Go , march the Regiment past , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="19">“ That every father and son may see ,</l>
     <l n="20">And none may ever forget . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">Oh , the crimson strands of her hair downpoured</l>
     <l n="22">Over her breasts of woe ;</l>
     <l n="23">And our grim old Colonel leaned on his sword ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the men filed past with their rifles lowered ,</l>
     <l n="25">Solemn and sad and slow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">But I 'll never forget till the day I die ,</l>
     <l n="27">As I stood in the driving rain ,</l>
     <l n="28">And the jaded columns of men slouched by ,</l>
     <l n="29">How amazement leapt into every eye ,</l>
     <l n="30">Then fury and grief and pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="31">And some would like madmen stand aghast ,</l>
     <l n="32">With their hands upclenched to the sky ;</l>
     <l n="33">And some would cross themselves as they passed ,</l>
     <l n="34">And some would curse in a scalding blast ,</l>
     <l n="35">And some like children cry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="36">Yea , some would be sobbing , and some would pray ,</l>
     <l n="37">And some hurl hateful names ;</l>
     <l n="38">But the best had never a word to say ;</l>
     <l n="39">They turned their twitching faces away ,</l>
     <l n="40">And their eyes were like hot flames .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="41">They passed ; then down on his bended knee</l>
     <l n="42">The Colonel dropped to the Dead :</l>
     <l n="43">“ Poor martyred daughter of France ! ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="44">“ O dearly , dearly avenged you 'll be</l>
     <l n="45">Or ever a day be sped ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="46">Now they hold that we are the best of the best ,</l>
     <l n="47">And each of our men may wear ,</l>
     <l n="48">Like a gash of crimson across his chest ,</l>
     <l n="49">As one fierce-proved in the battle-test ,</l>
     <l n="50">The blood-red Fourragère .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="51">For each as he leaps to the top can see ,</l>
     <l n="52">Like an etching of blood on his brain ,</l>
     <l n="53">A wife or a mother lashed to a tree ,</l>
     <l n="54">With two black holes where her breasts should be ,</l>
     <l n="55">Left to rot in the rain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="56">So we fight like fiends , and of us they say</l>
     <l n="57">That we neither yield nor spare .</l>
     <l n="58">Oh , we have the bitterest debt to pay . . . .</l>
     <l n="59">Have we paid it ?— Look — how we wear to-day</l>
     <l n="60">Like a trophy , gallant and proud and gay ,</l>
     <l n="61">Our blood-red Fourragère .</l>
    </lg>

   <p>It is often weary waiting at the little poste de secours . Some of us play solitaire , some read a “ sixpenny ” , some doze or try to talk in bad French to the poilus . Around us is discomfort , dirt and drama .</p>
   <p>For my part , I pass the time only too quickly , trying to put into verse the incidents and ideas that come my way . In this way I hope to collect quite a lot of stuff which may some day see itself in print .</p>
   <p>Here is one of my efforts :</p>

     <l n="6">Joy , pure joy to the heart of him ,</l>

     <l n="9">But I see him best as a tiny tot ,</l>

     <l n="12">With his sunny hair and his apple cheeks .</l>
     <l n="13">And my ! but the blue , blue eyes he 'd got ,</l>
     <l n="14">And just where his wee mouth dimpled dim</l>

     <l n="17">Oh , the war , the war ! How my eyes were wet !</l>

   </lg>
   <p>The road lies amid a malevolent heath . It seems to lead us right into the clutch of the enemy ; for the star-shells , that at first were bursting overhead , gradually encircle us . The fields are strangely sinister ; the splintered trees are like giant toothpicks . There is a lisping and a twanging overhead .</p>
   <p>As we wait at the door of the dugout that serves as a first-aid dressing station , I gaze up into that mysterious dark , so alive with musical vibrations . Then a small shadow detaches itself from the greater shadow , and a gray-bearded sentry says to me : “ You 'd better come in out of the bullets . ”</p>
   <p>So I keep under cover , and presently they bring my load . Two men drip with sweat as they carry their comrade . I can see that they all three belong to the Foreign Legion . I think for a moment of Saxon Dane . How strange if some day I should carry him ! Half fearfully I look at my passenger , but he is a black man . Such things only happen in fiction .</p>
   <p>This is what I have written of the finest troops in the Army of France :</p>
   <p>Kelly of the Legion</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now Kelly was no fighter ;</l>
     <l n="2">He loved his pipe and glass ;</l>
     <l n="3">An easygoing blighter ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who lived in Montparnasse .</l>
     <l n="5">But ‘ mid the tavern tattle</l>
     <l n="6">He heard some guinney say :</l>

     <l n="13">Well , Kelly joined the Legion ;</l>

   <p>Daventry , the sculptor , is buried in a little graveyard near one of our posts . Just now our section of the line is quiet , so I often go and sit there . Stretching myself on a flat stone , I dream for hours .</p>
   <p>Silence and solitude ! How good the peace of it all seems ! Around me the grasses weave a pattern , and half hide the hundreds of little wooden crosses . Here is one with a single name :</p>

   <p>Then one which has attached to it , in the cheapest of little frames , the crude water-color daub of a child , three purple flowers standing in a yellow vase . Below it , painfully printed , I read :</p>
   <p>To My Darling Papa — Thy Little Odette .</p>
   <p>And beyond the crosses many fresh graves have been dug . With hungry open mouths they wait . Even now I can hear the guns that are going to feed them . Soon there will be more crosses , and more and more . Then they will cease , and wives and mothers will come here to weep .</p>
   <p>Ah ! Peace so precious must be bought with blood and tears . Let us honor and bless the men who pay , and envy them the manner of their dying ; for not all the jeweled orders on the breasts of the living can vie in glory with the little wooden cross the humblest of these has won . . . .</p>

   <p>Over the spine of the ridge a horned moon of reddish hue peers through the splintered , hag-like trees . Where the trenches are , rockets are rising , green and red . I hear the coughing of the Maxims , the peevish nagging of the rifles , the boom of a “ heavy ” and the hollow sound of its exploding shell .</p>
   <p>Running the car into the shadow of a ruined house , I try to sleep . But a battery starts to blaze away close by , and the flame lights up my shelter . Near me some soldiers are in deep slumber ; one stirs in his sleep as a big rat runs over him , and I know by experience that when one is sleeping a rat feels as heavy as a sheep .</p>
   <p>But how can one possibly sleep ? Out there in the dark there is the wild tattoo of a thousand rifles ; and hark ! that dull roar is the explosion of a mine . There ! the purring of the rapid firers . Desperate things are doing . There will be lots of work for me before this night is over . What a cursed place !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As I cannot sleep , I think of a story I heard to-day . It is of a</l>

     <l n="6">I 've fixed the note to your collar , you 've got to get back to my Boys ,</l>

     <l n="8">The order came to go forward to a trench-line traced on the map ;</l>
     <l n="9">I knew the brass-hats had blundered , I knew and I told ‘ em so ;</l>
     <l n="10">I knew if I did as they ordered I would tumble into a trap ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="20">I rose and I donned my rain-coat ; I buckled my helmet tight .</l>

     <l n="22">I vaulted over the sandbags into the pitchy night ,</l>
     <l n="23">Into the pitted valley that served us as No Man 's Land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="24">I strode out over the hollow of hate and havoc and death ,</l>

     <l n="28">I fancy I cursed you , Billy ; but not so much as I ought !</l>
     <l n="29">And so we went forward together , till we came to the valley rim ,</l>
     <l n="30">And then a star-shell sputtered . . . it was even worse than I thought ,</l>
     <l n="31">For the trench they told me to move in was packed with Boche to the brim .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="32">They saw me too , and they got me ; they peppered me till I fell ;</l>
     <l n="33">And there I scribbled my message with my life-blood ebbing away ;</l>
     <l n="34">“ Now , Billy , you fat old duffer , you 've got to get back like hell ;</l>
     <l n="35">And get them to cancel that order before it 's the dawn of day .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="36">“ Billy , old boy , I love you , I kiss your shiny black nose ;</l>
     <l n="37">Now , home there . . . . Hurry , you devil ,</l>
     <l n="38">or I 'll cut you to ribands . . . . See . . . ”</l>
     <l n="39">Poor brute ! he 's off ! and I 'm dying . . . . I go as a soldier goes .</l>

   <p>Ah ! I never was intended for a job like this . I realize it more and more every day , but I will stick it out till I break down . To be nervous , over-imaginative , terribly sensitive to suffering , is a poor equipment for the man who starts out to drive wounded on the battlefield . I am haunted by the thought that my car may break down when I have a load of wounded . Once indeed it did , and a man died while I waited for help . Now I never look at what is given me . It might unnerve me .</p>
   <p>I have been at it for over six months without a rest . When an attack has been going on I have worked day and night , until as I drove I wanted to fall asleep at the wheel .</p>
   <p>The winter has been trying ; there is rain one day , frost the next . Mud up to the axles . One sleeps in lousy barns or dripping dugouts . Cold , hunger , dirt , I know them all singly and together . My only consolation is that the war must soon be over , and that I will have helped . When I have time and am not too tired , I comfort myself with scribbling .</p>

   <p>To-day I heard that MacBean had been killed in Belgium . I believe he turned out a wonderful soldier . Saxon Dane , too , has been missing for two months . We know what that means .</p>
   <p>It is odd how one gets callous to death , a mediaeval callousness . When we hear that the best of our friends have gone West , we have a moment of the keenest regret ; but how soon again we find the heart to laugh ! The saddest part of loss , I think , is that one so soon gets over it .</p>
   <p>Is it that we fail to realize it all ? Is it that it seems a strange and hideous dream , from which we will awake and rub our eyes ?</p>

      <l n="68">Four years have passed and it is winter again . Much has happened . When</l>
      <l n="69">I last wrote , on the Somme in 1915 , I was sickening with typhoid fever .</l>
      <l n="70">All that spring I was in hospital .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Nevertheless , I was sufficiently recovered to take part in the Champagne battle in the fall of that year , and to “ carry on ” during the following winter . It was at Verdun I got my first wound .</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1917 I again served with my Corps ; but on the entry of the United States into the War I joined the army of my country . In the Argonne I had my left arm shot away .</p>
   <p>As far as time and health permitted , I kept a record of these years , and also wrote much verse . All this , however , has disappeared under circumstances into which there is no need to enter here . The loss was a cruel one , almost more so than that of my arm ; for I have neither the heart nor the power to rewrite this material .</p>
   <p>And now , in default of something better , I have bundled together this manuscript , and have added to it a few more verses , written in hospitals . Let it represent me . If I can find a publisher for it , tant mieux . If not , I will print it at my own cost , and any one who cares for a copy can write to me —</p>

      <l n="463">So white , so pinched her face , my heart still bleeds ,</l>
      <l n="464">And at the touch of her , oh , how I shook !</l>
      <l n="465">And then last night I passed the window where</l>
      <l n="466">They sat together ; I could see them clear ,</l>
      <l n="467">The lamplight softly gleaming on their hair ,</l>
      <l n="468">And all the room so full of cozy cheer .</l>
      <l n="469">My wife was sewing , while my daughter read ;</l>
      <l n="470">I even saw my portrait on the wall .</l>
      <l n="471">I wanted to rush in , to tell them all ;</l>
      <l n="472">And then I cursed myself : “ You 're dead , you 're dead ! ”</l>
      <l n="473">God ! how I watched them from the darkness there ,</l>
      <l n="474">Clutching the dripping branches of a tree ,</l>
      <l n="475">Peering as close as ever I might dare ,</l>

    <head>Notes .</head>
    <p n="1">While ‘ Stephen Poore ’ is a fictional character , he is real enough in some ways . Robert Service was himself in the Ambulance Corps , and his descriptions of ‘ Bohemia ’ of this day , and the emergence of war , bear striking similarities to the case of Alan Seeger — and , no doubt , a great many other ‘ war poets ’ of the “ Great War ” . It has been said that every section of the trench had its own poet , and many of them , such as Wilfred Owen , Siegfried Sassoon , and Robert Graves , became famous for their poetry of the war . This book , in its way , presents a striking picture of the effect of the war on Europe — though it stops short of showing just how great the effect was .</p>
    <p n="2">I hope you enjoyed Service 's references to himself in the text , as “ Sourdough Service ” — but they should not be taken too seriously .</p>
    <p n="3">The names of two great Russian composers , Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky , were originally spelled Tschaikowsky and Stravinski in “ The Philistine and the Bohemian ” . These composers were contemporaries of the author , and due to the difficulty of transliterating from the Russian ( Cyrillic ) alphabet to the Roman Alphabet , hampered by different uses of Roman letters in various European languages , it is not until fairly recently that the current spellings have taken hold — and their grip is not yet firm . A couple of other names were given incorrectly in the same poem : Mallarmé was spelled with one L , and E. Burne-Jones ( a pre-Raphaelite painter and associate of Rossetti ) was given as F. B. Jones . These names are corrected in this text , as is Synge , given as Singe in the original ( “ L'Escargot D'Or ” ) .</p>
