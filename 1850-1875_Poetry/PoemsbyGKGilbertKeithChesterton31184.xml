     <l n="1">There fared a mother driven forth</l>

     <l n="5">The crazy stable close at hand ,</l>

     <l n="12">Whenever the day is done .</l>
     <l n="13">Here we have battle and blazing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="14">And chance and honour and high surprise ,</l>

     <l n="29">And our peace is put in impossible things</l>

    <head>A SONG OF GIFTS TO GOD</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When the first Christmas presents came , the straw where Christ was rolled</l>
     <l n="2">Smelt sweeter than their frankincense , burnt brighter than their gold ,</l>
     <l n="3">And a wise man said , “ We will not give ; the thanks would be but cold . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">“ Nay , ” said the next , “ To all new gifts , to this gift or another ,</l>
     <l n="5">Bends the high gratitude of God ; even as He now , my brother ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Then spake the third of the Wise Men ; the wisest of the three :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="19">Babe of the thousand birthdays , we that are young yet grey ,</l>

     <l n="21">We that with sects and whims and wars have wasted Christmas Day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="22">Light Thou Thy censer to Thyself , for all our fires are dim ,</l>
     <l n="23">Stamp Thou Thine image on our coin , for Caesar 's face grows dim ,</l>
     <l n="24">And a dumb devil of pride and greed has taken hold of him .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="25">We bring Thee back great Christendom , churches and towns and towers .</l>
