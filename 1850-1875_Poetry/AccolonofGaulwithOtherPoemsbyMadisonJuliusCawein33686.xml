    <head>PRELUDE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Why , dreams from dreams in dreams remembered ! naught</l>
     <l n="2">Save this , alas ! that once it seemed I thought</l>
     <l n="3">I wandered dim with someone , but I knew</l>
     <l n="4">Not who ; most beautiful and good and true ,</l>
     <l n="5">Yet sad through suffering ; with curl-crowned brow ,</l>
     <l n="6">Soft eyes and voice ; so white she haunts me now :—</l>
     <l n="7">And when , and where ?— At night in dreamland .</l>
     <l n="8">She</l>
     <l n="9">Led me athwart a flower-showered lea</l>
     <l n="10">Where trammeled puckered pansy and the pea ;</l>
     <l n="11">Spread stains of pale-rod poppies rinced of rain ,</l>
     <l n="12">So gorged with sun their hurt hearts ached with pain ;</l>
     <l n="13">Heaped honeysuckles ; roses lavishing beams ,</l>
     <l n="14">Wherein I knew were huddled little dreams</l>
     <l n="15">Which laughed coy , hidden merriment and there</l>
     <l n="16">Blew quick gay kisses fragrancing the air .</l>
     <l n="17">And where a river bubbled through the sward</l>
     <l n="18">A mist lay sleepily ; and it was hard</l>
     <l n="19">To see whence sprung it , to what seas it led ,</l>
     <l n="20">How broadly spread and what it was it fled</l>
     <l n="21">So ceasless in its sighs , and bickering on</l>
     <l n="22">Into romance or some bewildering dawn</l>
     <l n="23">Of wisest legend from the storied wells</l>
     <l n="24">Of lost Baranton , where old Merlin dwells ,</l>
     <l n="25">Nodding a white poll and a grand , gray beard</l>
     <l n="26">As if some Lake Ladye he , listening , heard ,</l>
     <l n="27">Who spake like water , danced like careful showers</l>
     <l n="28">With blown gold curls thro ’ drifts of wild-thorn flowers ;</l>
     <l n="29">Loose , lazy arms in graceful movement tossed ,</l>
     <l n="30">Float flower-like down a woodland vista , lost</l>
     <l n="31">In some peculiar note that wrings a tear</l>
     <l n="32">Slow down his withered cheek . And then steals near</l>
     <l n="33">Her sweet , lascivious brow 's white wonderment ,</l>
     <l n="34">And gray rude eyes , and hair which hath the scent</l>
     <l n="35">Of the wildwood Breceliand 's perfumes</l>
     <l n="36">In Brittany ; and in it one red bloom 's</l>
     <l n="37">Blood-drop thrust deep , and so “ Sweet Viviane ! ”</l>
     <l n="38">All the glad leaves lisp like a young , soft rain</l>
     <l n="39">From top to top , until a running surge</l>
     <l n="40">The dark , witch-haunted solitude will urge ,</l>
     <l n="41">That shakes and sounds and stammers as from sleep</l>
     <l n="42">Some giant were aroused ; and with a leap</l>
     <l n="43">A samite-gauzy creature , glossy white ,</l>
     <l n="44">Showers mocking kisses fast and , like a light</l>
     <l n="45">Beat by a gust to flutter and then done ,</l>
     <l n="46">From Breceliande and Merlin she is gone .</l>
     <l n="47">But still he sits there drowsing with his dreams ;</l>
     <l n="48">A wondrous cohort hath he ; many as gleams</l>
     <l n="49">That stab the moted mazes of a beech ;</l>
     <l n="50">And each grave dream hath its own magic speech</l>
     <l n="51">To sting to tears his old eyes heavy — two</l>
     <l n="52">Hang , tangled brilliants , in his beard like dew :</l>
     <l n="53">And still faint murmurs of courts brave and fair ,</l>
     <l n="54">And forms of Arthur and proud Guenevere ,</l>
     <l n="55">Grave Tristram and rare Isoud and stout Mark ,</l>
     <l n="56">Bold Launcelot , chaste Galahad the dark</l>
     <l n="57">Of his weak mind , once strong , glares up with , then ,</l>
     <l n="58">— The instant 's fostered blossoms — die again .</l>
     <l n="59">A roar of tournament , a rippling stir</l>
     <l n="60">Of silken lists that ramble into her ,</l>
     <l n="61">That white witch-mothered beauty , Viviane ,</l>
     <l n="62">The vast Breceliande and dreams again .</l>
     <l n="63">Then Dagonet , King Arthur 's fool , trips there ,</l>
     <l n="64">A waggish cunning ; glittering on his hair</l>
     <l n="65">A tinsel crown ; and then will slightly sway</l>
     <l n="66">Thick leaves and part , and there Morgane the Fay</l>
     <l n="67">With haughty wicked eyes and lovely face</l>
     <l n="68">Studies him steady for a little space .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>I .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="69">“ Thou askest with thy studious eyes again ,</l>
      <l n="70">Here where the restless forest hears the main</l>
      <l n="71">Toss in a troubled sleep and moan . Ah , sweet ,</l>
      <l n="72">With joy and passion the kind hour 's replete ;</l>
      <l n="73">And what wild beauty here ! where roughly run</l>
      <l n="74">Huge forest shadows from the westering sun ,</l>
      <l n="75">The wood 's a subdued power gentle as</l>
      <l n="76">Yon tame wild-things , that in the moss and grass</l>
      <l n="77">Gaze with their human eyes . Here grow the lines</l>
      <l n="78">Of pale-starred green ; and where yon fountain shines</l>
      <l n="79">Urned in its tremulous ferns , rest we upon</l>
      <l n="80">This oak-trunk of God 's thunder overthrown</l>
      <l n="81">Years , years agone ; not where ‘ tis rotted brown</l>
      <l n="82">But where the thick bark 's firm and overgrown</l>
      <l n="83">Of clambering ivy blackly berried ; where</l>
      <l n="84">Wild musk of wood decay just tincts the air ,</l>
      <l n="85">As if some strange shrub on some whispering way ,</l>
      <l n="86">In some dewed dell , while dreaming of one May ,</l>
      <l n="87">In longing languor weakly tried to wake</l>
      <l n="88">One sometime blossom and could only make</l>
      <l n="89">Ghosts of such dead aromas as it knew ,</l>
      <l n="90">And shape a specter , budding thin as dew ,</l>
      <l n="91">To haunt these sounding miles of solitude .</l>
      <l n="92">Troubled thou askest , Morgane , and the mood ,</l>
      <l n="93">Unfathomed in thine eyes , glows rash and deep</l>
      <l n="94">As that in some wild-woman 's found on sleep</l>
      <l n="95">By some lost knight upon a precipice ,</l>
      <l n="96">Whom he hath wakened with a laughing kiss .</l>
      <l n="97">As that of some frail , elfin lady white</l>
      <l n="98">As if of watery moonbeams , filmy dight ,</l>
      <l n="99">Who waves diaphanous beauty on some cliff</l>
      <l n="100">That drowsing purrs with moon-drenched pines ; but if</l>
      <l n="101">The lone knight follow , foul fiends rise and drag</l>
      <l n="102">Him crashing down , while she , tall on the crag ,</l>
      <l n="103">Triumphant mocks him with glad sorcery</l>
      <l n="104">Till all the wildwood echoes shout with glee .</l>
      <l n="105">As that bewildering mystery of a tarn ,</l>
      <l n="106">Some mountain water , which the mornings scorn</l>
      <l n="107">To anadem with fire and leave gray ;</l>
      <l n="108">To which some champion cometh when the Day</l>
      <l n="109">Hath tired of breding on his proud , young head</l>
      <l n="110">Flame-furry blooms and , golden chapleted ,</l>
      <l n="111">Sits rosy , trembling with full love for Night ,</l>
      <l n="112">Who cometh sandaled ; dark in crape ; the light</l>
      <l n="113">Of her good eyes a marvel ; her vast hair</l>
      <l n="114">Tortuous with stars ,— as in some shadowy lair</l>
      <l n="115">The eyes of hunted wild things burn with rage ,—</l>
      <l n="116">And on large bosoms doth his love assuage .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="117">“ He , coming thither in that haunted place ,</l>
      <l n="118">Stoops low to quaff cool waters , when his face</l>
      <l n="119">Meets gurgling fairy faces in a ring</l>
      <l n="120">That jostle upward babbling ; beckoning</l>
      <l n="121">Him deep to wonders secret built of old</l>
      <l n="122">By some dim witch : ‘ A city walled with gold ,</l>
      <l n="123">With beryl battlements and paved with pearls ,</l>
      <l n="124">Slim , lambent towers wrought of foamy swirls</l>
      <l n="125">Of alabaster , and that witch to love ,</l>
      <l n="126">More beautiful to love than queens above . ’ —</l>
      <l n="127">He pauses troubled , but a wizard power ,</l>
      <l n="128">In all his bronzen harness that mad hour</l>
      <l n="129">Plunges him — whither ? what if he should miss</l>
      <l n="130">Those cloudy beauties and that creature 's kiss ?</l>
      <l n="131">Ah , Morgane , that same power Accolon</l>
      <l n="132">Saw potent in thine eyes and it hath drawn</l>
      <l n="133">Him deep to plunge — and to what breathless fate ?—</l>
      <l n="134">Bliss ?— which , too true , he hath well quaffed of late !</l>
      <l n="135">But , there !— may come what stealthy-footed Death</l>
      <l n="136">With bony claws to clutch away his breath !</l>
      <l n="137">And make him loveless to those eyes , alas !—</l>
      <l n="138">Fain must I speak that vision ; thus it was :</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="139">“ In sleep one plucked me some warm fleurs-de-lis ,</l>
      <l n="140">Larger than those of earth ; and I might see</l>
      <l n="141">Their woolly gold , loose , webby woven thro ’ ,—</l>
      <l n="142">Like fluffy flames spun ,— gauzy with fine dew .</l>
      <l n="143">And ‘ asphodels ! ’ I murmured ; then , ‘ these sure</l>
      <l n="144">The Eden amaranths , so angel pure</l>
      <l n="145">That these alone may pluck them ; aye and aye !</l>
      <l n="146">But with that giving , lo , she passed away</l>
      <l n="147">Beyond me on some misty , yearning brook</l>
      <l n="148">With some sweet song , which all the wild air took</l>
      <l n="149">With torn farewells and pensive melody</l>
      <l n="150">Touching to tears , strange , hopeless utterly .</l>
      <l n="151">So merciless sweet that I yearned high to tear</l>
      <l n="152">Those ingot-cored and gold-crowned lilies fair ;</l>
      <l n="153">Yet over me a horror which restrained</l>
      <l n="154">With melancholy presence of two pained</l>
      <l n="155">And awful , mighty eyes that cowed and held</l>
      <l n="156">Me weeping while that sad dirge died or swelled</l>
      <l n="157">Far , far on endless waters borne away :</l>
      <l n="158">A wild bird 's musick smitten when the ray</l>
      <l n="159">Of dawn it burned for graced its drooping head ,</l>
      <l n="160">And the pale glory strengthened round it dead ;</l>
      <l n="161">Daggered of thorns it plunged on , blind in night ,</l>
      <l n="162">The slow blood ruby on its plumage white .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="163">“ Then , then I knew these blooms which she had given</l>
      <l n="164">Were strays of parting grief and waifs of Heaven</l>
      <l n="165">For tears and memories ; too delicate</l>
      <l n="166">For eyes of earth such souls immaculate !</l>
      <l n="167">But then — my God ! my God ! thus these were left !</l>
      <l n="168">I knew then still ! but of that song bereft —</l>
      <l n="169">That rapturous wonder grasping after grief —</l>
      <l n="170">Beyond all thought — weak thought that would be thief . ”</l>
      <l n="171">And bowed and wept into his hands and she</l>
      <l n="172">Sorrowful beheld ; and resting at her knee</l>
      <l n="173">Raised slow her oblong lute and smote its chords ;</l>
      <l n="174">But ere the impulse saddened into words</l>
      <l n="175">Said : “ And didst love me as thy lips have spake</l>
      <l n="176">No visions wrought of sleep might such love shake .</l>
      <l n="177">Fast is all Love in fastness of his power ,</l>
      <l n="178">With flame reverberant moated stands his tower ;</l>
      <l n="179">Not so built as to chink from fact a beam</l>
      <l n="180">Of doubt and much less of a doubt from dream ;</l>
      <l n="181">Such , the alchemic fires of Love 's desires ,</l>
      <l n="182">Which hug this like a snake , melt to gold wires</l>
      <l n="183">To chord the old lyre new whereon he lyres . ”</l>
      <l n="184">So ceased and then , sad softness in her eye</l>
      <l n="185">Sang to his dream a questioning reply :</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="186">“ Will love grow less when dead the roguish Spring ,</l>

      <l n="477">Stalked like soft shadows ; where the hares did run ,</l>
      <l n="478">Mavis and throstle caroled in the sun .</l>
      <l n="479">For it was Morgane 's realm , embowered Gore ;</l>

      <l n="483">Noon ; and the wistful Autumn sat among</l>
      <l n="484">The lurid woodlands ; chiefs who now were wrung</l>
      <l n="485">By crafty ministers , sun , wind and frost ,</l>
      <l n="486">To don imperial pomp at any cost .</l>
      <l n="487">On each wild hill they stood as if for war</l>
      <l n="488">Flaunting barbaric raiment wide and far ;</l>
      <l n="489">And burnt-out lusts in aged faces raged ;</l>
      <l n="490">Their tottering state by flattering zephyrs paged ,</l>
      <l n="491">Who in a little fretful while , how soon !</l>
      <l n="492">Would work rebellion under some wan moon ;</l>
      <l n="493">Pluck their old beards deriding ; shriek and tear</l>
      <l n="494">Rich royalty ; sow tattered through the air</l>
      <l n="495">Their purple majesty ; and from each head</l>
      <l n="496">Dash down its golden crown , and in its stead</l>
      <l n="497">Set there a pale-death mockery of snow ,</l>
      <l n="498">Leave them bemoaning beggars bowed with woe .</l>
      <l n="499">Blow , wood-wind , blow ! now that all 's fresh and fine</l>
      <l n="500">As earth and wood can make it ; fresh as brine</l>
      <l n="501">And rare with sodden scents of underbrush .</l>
      <l n="502">Ring , and one hears a cavalcade a-rush ;</l>
      <l n="503">Bold blare of horns ; shrill music of steel bows ;—</l>
      <l n="504">A horn ! a horn ! the hunt is up and goes</l>
      <l n="505">Beneath the acorn-dropping oaks in green ,—</l>
      <l n="506">Dark woodland green , a boar-spear held between</l>
      <l n="507">His selle and hunter 's head , and at his thigh</l>
      <l n="508">A good , broad hanger , and one fist on high</l>
      <l n="509">To wind the rapid echoes from his horn ,</l>
      <l n="510">That start the field birds from the sheaved corn ,</l>
      <l n="511">Uphurled in vollies of audacious wings ,</l>
      <l n="512">That cease again when it no longer sings .</l>
      <l n="513">Away , away , they flash a belted band</l>
      <l n="514">From Camelot thro ’ that haze-ghostly land ;</l>
      <l n="515">Hounds leashed and leamers and a flash of steel ,</l>
      <l n="516">A tramp of horse and the long-baying peal</l>
      <l n="517">Of stag hounds whimp'ring and — behold ! the hart ,</l>
      <l n="518">A lordly height , doth from the covert dart ;</l>
      <l n="519">And the big blood-hounds strain unto the chase .</l>
      <l n="520">A-hunt ! a-hunt ! the pryce seems but a pace</l>
      <l n="521">On ere ‘ tis wound ; but now , where interlace</l>
      <l n="522">The dense-briered underwoods , the hounds have lost</l>
      <l n="523">The slot , there where a forest brook hath crossed</l>
      <l n="524">With intercepting waters full of leaves .</l>
      <l n="525">Beyond , the hart a tangled labyrinth weaves</l>
      <l n="526">Thro ’ dimmer boscage , and the wizard sun</l>
      <l n="527">Shapes many shadowy stags that seem to run</l>
      <l n="528">Wild herds before the baffled foresters .</l>
      <l n="529">And treed aloft a reckless laugh one hears ,</l>
      <l n="530">As if some helping goblin from the trees</l>
      <l n="531">Mocked them the unbayed hart and made a breeze</l>
      <l n="532">His pursuivant of mocking . Hastening thence</l>
      <l n="533">Pursued King Arthur and King Urience</l>
      <l n="534">With one small brachet , till scarce hear could they</l>
      <l n="535">Their fellowship far-furthered course away</l>
      <l n="536">On fresher trace of hind or rugged boar</l>
      <l n="537">With haggard , hairy flanks , curled tusks and hoar</l>
      <l n="538">With fierce foam-fury ; and of these bereft</l>
      <l n="539">The kings continued in the slot they 'd left .</l>
      <l n="540">And there the hart plunged gallant thro ’ the brake</l>
      <l n="541">Leaving a torn path shaking in his wake ,</l>
      <l n="542">Down which they followed on thro ’ many a copse</l>
      <l n="543">Above whose brush , close on before , the tops</l>
      <l n="544">Of the large antlers swelled anon , and so</l>
      <l n="545">Were gone where beat the brambles to and fro .</l>
      <l n="546">And still they drave him hard ; and ever near</l>
      <l n="547">Seemed that great hart unwearied ; and such cheer</l>
      <l n="548">Still stung them to the chase . When Arthur 's horse</l>
      <l n="549">Gasped mightily and lunging in his course</l>
      <l n="550">Lay dead , a lordly bay ; and Urience</l>
      <l n="551">Left his gray hunter dying near ; and thence</l>
      <l n="552">They held the hunt afoot ; when suddenly</l>
      <l n="553">Were they aware of a wide , roughened sea ,</l>
      <l n="554">And near the wood the hart upon the sward</l>
      <l n="555">Bayed , panting unto death and winded hard .</l>
      <l n="556">Right so the king dispatched him and the pryce</l>
      <l n="557">Wound on his hunting bugle clearly thrice .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="558">As if each echo , which that wild horn 's blast</l>
      <l n="559">Waked from its sleep ,— the quietude had cast</l>
      <l n="560">Tender as mercy on it ,— in a band</l>
      <l n="561">Rose moving sounds of gladness hand in hand ,</l>
      <l n="562">Came twelve fair damsels , sunny in sovereign white ,</l>
      <l n="563">From that red woodland gliding . These each knight</l>
      <l n="564">Graced with obeisance and “ Our lord , ” said one ,</l>
      <l n="565">“ Tenders ye courtesy until the dawn ;</l>
      <l n="566">The Earl Sir Damas ; well in his wide keep ,</l>
      <l n="567">Seen thither with due worship , ye shall sleep . ”</l>
      <l n="568">And then they came o'erwearied to a hall ,</l>
      <l n="569">An owlet-haunted pile , whose weedy wall</l>
      <l n="570">Towered based on crags rough , windy turrets high ;</l>
      <l n="571">An old , gaunt giant-castle ‘ gainst a sky</l>
      <l n="572">Wherein the moon hung foam-faced , large and full .</l>
      <l n="573">Down on dank sea-foundations broke the dull ,</l>
      <l n="574">Weird monotone of ocean , and wide rolled</l>
      <l n="575">The watery wilderness that was as old</l>
      <l n="576">As loud , defying headlands stretching out</l>
      <l n="577">Beneath still stars with a voluminous shout</l>
      <l n="578">Of wreck and wrath forever . Here the two</l>
      <l n="579">Were feasted fairly and with worship due</l>
      <l n="580">All errant knights , and then a damsel led</l>
      <l n="581">Each knight with flaring lamp unto his bed</l>
      <l n="582">Down separate corridores of that great keep ;</l>
      <l n="583">And soon they rested in a heavy sleep .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="584">And then King Arthur woke , and woke mid groans</l>
      <l n="585">Of dolorous knights ; and ‘ round him lay the bones</l>
      <l n="586">Of many woful champions mouldering ;</l>
      <l n="587">And he could hear the open ocean ring</l>
      <l n="588">Wild wasted waves above . And so he thought</l>
      <l n="589">“ It is some nightmare weighing me , distraught</l>
      <l n="590">By that long hunt ; ” and then he sought to shake</l>
      <l n="591">The horror off and to himself awake ;</l>
      <l n="592">But still he heard sad groans and whispering sighs ,</l>
      <l n="593">And deep in iron-ribbed cells the eyes</l>
      <l n="594">Of pale , cadaverous knights shone fixed on him</l>
      <l n="595">Unhappy ; and he felt his senses swim</l>
      <l n="596">With foulness of that cell , and , “ What are ye ?</l>
      <l n="597">Ghosts of chained champions or a company</l>
      <l n="598">Of phantoms , bodiless fiends ? If speak ye can ,</l>
      <l n="599">Speak , in God 's name ! for I am here — a man ! ”</l>
      <l n="600">Then groaned the shaggy throat of one who lay</l>
      <l n="601">A dusky nightmare dying day by day ,</l>
      <l n="602">Yet once of comely mien and strong withal</l>
      <l n="603">And greatly gracious ; but , now hunger-tall ,</l>
      <l n="604">With scrawny beard and faded hands and cheeks :</l>
      <l n="605">“ Sir knight , ” said he , “ know that the wretch who speaks</l>
      <l n="606">Is but an one of twenty knights here shamed</l>
      <l n="607">Of him who lords this castle , Damas named ,</l>
      <l n="608">Who mews us here for slow starvation keen ;</l>
      <l n="609">Around you fade the bones of some eighteen</l>
      <l n="610">Tried knights of Britain ; and God grant that soon</l>
      <l n="611">My hunger-lengthened ghost will see the moon ,</l>
      <l n="612">Beyond the vileness of this prisonment ! ”</l>
      <l n="613">With that he sighed and round the dungeon went</l>
      <l n="614">A rustling sigh , like saddened sin , and so</l>
      <l n="615">Another dim , thin voice complained their woe :—</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="22">
      <l n="616">“ He doth enchain us with this common end ,</l>
      <l n="617">That he find one who will his prowess bend</l>
      <l n="618">To the attainment of his livelihood .</l>
      <l n="619">A younger brother , Ontzlake , hath he ; good</l>
      <l n="620">And courteous , withal most noble , whom</l>
      <l n="621">This Damas hates — yea , ever seeks his doom ;</l>
      <l n="622">Denying him to their estate all right</l>
      <l n="623">Save that he holds by main of arms and might .</l>
      <l n="624">And thro ’ puissance hath he some fat fields</l>
      <l n="625">And one rich manor sumptuous , where he yields</l>
      <l n="626">Belated knights host 's hospitality .</l>
      <l n="627">Then bold is Ontzlake , Damas cowardly .</l>
      <l n="628">For Ontzlake would decide by sword and lance</l>
      <l n="629">Body for body this inheritance ;</l>
      <l n="630">But Damas dotes on life so courageless ;</l>
      <l n="631">Thus on all knights perforce lays coward 's stress</l>
      <l n="632">To fight for him or starve . For ye must know</l>
      <l n="633">That in his country he is hated so</l>
      <l n="634">That no helm here is who will take the fight ;</l>
      <l n="635">Thus fortunes it our plight is such a plight . ”</l>
      <l n="636">Quoth he and ceased . And wondering at the tale</l>
      <l n="637">The King was thoughtful , and each faded , pale ,</l>
      <l n="638">Poor countenance still conned him when he spake :</l>
      <l n="639">“ And what reward if one this battle take ? ”</l>
      <l n="640">“ Deliverance for all if of us one</l>
      <l n="641">Consent to be his party 's champion .</l>
      <l n="642">But treachery and he are so close kin</l>
      <l n="643">We loathe the part as some misshapen sin ,</l>
      <l n="644">And here would rather dally on to death</l>
      <l n="645">Than serving falseness save and slave our breath . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="23">
      <l n="646">“ May God deliver you for mercy , sirs ! ”</l>
      <l n="647">And right anon an iron noise he hears</l>
      <l n="648">Of chains clanked loose and bars jarred rusty back ,</l>
      <l n="649">The heavy gate croak open ; and the black</l>
      <l n="650">Of that rank cell astonished was with light ,</l>
      <l n="651">That danced fantastic with the frantic night .</l>
      <l n="652">One high torch sidewise worried by the gust</l>
      <l n="653">Sunned that lorn den of hunger , death and rust ,</l>
      <l n="654">And one tall damsel vaguely vestured , fair</l>
      <l n="655">With shadowy hair , poised on the rocky stair .</l>
      <l n="656">And laughing on the King , “ What cheer ? ” said she ;</l>
      <l n="657">“ God 's life ! the keep stinks vilely ! and to see</l>
      <l n="658">So noble knights endungeoned hollowing here</l>
      <l n="659">Doth pain me sore with pity — but , what cheer ? ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="24">
      <l n="660">“ Thou mockest us ; for me the sorriest</l>
      <l n="661">Since I was suckled ; and of any quest</l>
      <l n="662">To me the most imperiling and strange .—</l>
      <l n="663">But what wouldst thou ? ” said Arthur . She , “ A change</l>
      <l n="664">I offer thee , through thee to these with thee ,</l>
      <l n="665">And thou but grant me in love 's courtesy</l>
      <l n="666">To fight for Damas and his livelihood .</l>
      <l n="667">And if thou wilt not — look ! thou seest this brood</l>
      <l n="668">Of lean and dwindled bellies specter-eyed ,</l>
      <l n="669">Keen knights erst who refused me ?— so decide . ”</l>
      <l n="670">Then thought the King of the sweet sky , the breeze</l>
      <l n="671">That blew delirious over waves and trees ;</l>
      <l n="672">Thick fields of grasses and the sunny earth</l>
      <l n="673">Whose beating heat filled the red heart with mirth ,</l>
      <l n="674">And made the world one sovereign pleasure house</l>
      <l n="675">Where king and serf might revel and carouse ;</l>
      <l n="676">Then of the hunt on autumn-plaintive hills ;</l>
      <l n="677">Lone forest chapels by their radiant rills :</l>
      <l n="678">His palace rich at Caerlleon upon Usk ,</l>
      <l n="679">And Camelot 's loud halls that thro ’ the dusk</l>
      <l n="680">Blazed far and bloomed a rose of revelry ;</l>
      <l n="681">Or in the misty morning shadowy</l>
      <l n="682">Loomed grave for audience . And then he thought</l>
      <l n="683">Of his Round Table and that Grael wide sought</l>
      <l n="684">In haunted holds on demon-sinful shore ;</l>
      <l n="685">Then marveled of what wars would rise and roar</l>
      <l n="686">With dragon heads unconquered and devour</l>
      <l n="687">This realm of Britain and pluck up that flower</l>
      <l n="688">Of chivalry whence ripened his renown :</l>
      <l n="689">And then the reign of some besotted crown ,</l>
      <l n="690">A bandit king of lust , idolatry —</l>
      <l n="691">And with that thought for tears he could not see :</l>
      <l n="692">Then of his greatest champions , King Ban 's son ,</l>
      <l n="693">And Galahad and Tristram , Accolon :</l>
      <l n="694">And then , ah God ! of his dear Guenevere ,</l>
      <l n="695">And with that thought — to starve and moulder here ?—</l>
      <l n="696">For , being unfriend to Arthur and his court ,</l>
      <l n="697">Well wist he this grim Earl would bless that sport</l>
      <l n="698">Of fortune which had fortuned him so well</l>
      <l n="699">To have to starve his sovereign in a cell .—</l>
      <l n="700">In the entombing rock where ground the deep ;</l>
      <l n="701">And all the life shut in his limbs did leap</l>
      <l n="702">Thro ’ eager veins and sinews fierce and red ,</l>
      <l n="703">Stung on to action , and he rose and said :</l>
      <l n="704">“ That which thou askest is right hard , but , lo !</l>
      <l n="705">To rot here harder ; I will fight his foe .</l>
      <l n="706">But , mark , I have no weapons and no mail ,</l>
      <l n="707">No steed against that other to avail . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="25">
      <l n="708">“ Fear not for that ; and thou shalt lack none , sire . ”</l>
      <l n="709">And so she led the path : her torch 's fire</l>
      <l n="710">Scaring wild spidery shadows at each stride</l>
      <l n="711">From cob-webbed coignes of scowling passes wide ,</l>
      <l n="712">That labyrinthed the rock foundation strong</l>
      <l n="713">Of that ungainly fortress bleak of wrong .</l>
      <l n="714">At length they came to a nail-studded door ,</l>
      <l n="715">Which she unlocked with one harsh key she bore</l>
      <l n="716">Mid many keys bunched at her girdle ; thence</l>
      <l n="717">They issued on a terraced eminence .</l>
      <l n="718">Beneath the sea broke sounding ; and the King</l>
      <l n="719">Breathed open air that had the smell and sting</l>
      <l n="720">Of brine morn-vigored and blue-billowed foam ;</l>
      <l n="721">For in the East the second dawning 's gloam ,</l>
      <l n="722">Since that unlucky chase , was freaked with streaks</l>
      <l n="723">Red as the ripe stripes of an apple 's cheeks .</l>
      <l n="724">And so within that larger light of dawn</l>
      <l n="725">It seemed to Arthur now that he had known</l>
      <l n="726">This maiden at his court , and so he asked .</l>
      <l n="727">But she , well-tutored , her real person masked ,</l>
      <l n="728">And answered falsely ; “ Nay , deceive thee not ;</l>
      <l n="729">Thou saw'st me ne'er at Arthur 's court , I wot .</l>
      <l n="730">For here it likes me best to sing and spin</l>
      <l n="731">And work the hangings my sire 's halls within :</l>
      <l n="732">No courts or tournaments or gallants brave</l>
      <l n="733">To flatter me and love ! for me — the wave ,</l>
      <l n="734">The forest , field and sky ; the calm , the storm ;</l>
      <l n="735">My garth wherein I walk to think ; the charm</l>
      <l n="736">Of uplands redolent at bounteous noon</l>
      <l n="737">And full of sunlight ; night 's free stars and moon ;</l>
      <l n="738">White ships that pass some several every year ;</l>
      <l n="739">These lonesome towers and those wild mews to hear . ”</l>
      <l n="740">“ An owlet maid ! ” the King laughed . But , untrue</l>
      <l n="741">Was she , and of false Morgane 's treasonous crew ,</l>
      <l n="742">Who worked vile wiles ev'n to the slaying of</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="26">

      <l n="759">At sensuous ease on tumbled beds of flowers ,</l>
      <l n="760">Had caught a laughing language light thereof ,</l>
      <l n="761">And rambled ever gently whispering , “ love ! ” —</l>
      <l n="762">On cool white walls her hands had deftly draped</l>
      <l n="763">A dark rich hanging , where were worked and shaped</l>
      <l n="764">Her fullest hours of pleasure flesh and mind ,</l>
      <l n="765">Imperishable passions , which could wind</l>
      <l n="766">The past and present quickly ; and could mate</l>

      <l n="775">To leap beside him o'er the gleaming ground ;</l>
      <l n="776">No handmaid lovely of his loveliest fair ,</l>
      <l n="777">Or paging dwarf in purple with him there ;</l>
      <l n="778">But this her lute , about which her perfume</l>
      <l n="779">Clung odorous of memories , that made bloom</l>
      <l n="780">Her flowing features rosy to his eyes ,</l>
      <l n="781">That saw the words , his sense could but surmise ,</l>
      <l n="782">Shaped on dim , breathing lips ; the laugh that drunk</l>
      <l n="783">Her deep soul-fire from eyes wherein it sunk</l>
      <l n="784">And slowly waned away to smouldering dreams ,</l>
      <l n="785">Fathomless with thought , far in their dove-gray gleams .</l>
      <l n="786">And so for those most serious eyes and lips ,</l>

      <l n="788">Of buoyant being bubbling to his voice</l>
      <l n="789">To chant her praises ; and with nervous poise</l>
      <l n="790">His fleet , trained fingers call from her long lute</l>
      <l n="791">Such riotous notes as must make madly mute</l>

      <l n="793">And well he knows that winging hence it 'll sing</l>
      <l n="794">These aching notes , whose beauties burn and pain</l>

      <l n="804">Hard at her heart , and longing rears to Death</l>
      <l n="805">Two prayerful eyes of pleading “ for one breath —</l>

      <l n="1025">Of far deluging glory , and the air</l>
      <l n="1026">Sang with the wood-bird , like a humming lyre</l>
      <l n="1027">Swept bold of minstrel fingers wire on wire ;</l>
      <l n="1028">Ere that fixed hour of prime came Arthur armed</l>
      <l n="1029">For battle royally . A black steed warmed</l>
      <l n="1030">A fierce impatience ‘ neath him cased in mail ,</l>

      <l n="1037">With lordly golden purple ; whence did sweep</l>
      <l n="1038">Two hanging acorn tuftings of fine gold ,</l>
      <l n="1039">And at his thigh a falchion , long and bold ,</l>

      <l n="1045">Bone of the sea-horse , tongued with jet-black bone .</l>
      <l n="1046">And , sapphire-set , a burgonet of gold</l>

      <l n="1115">Shrieked shrill the unpierced shields ; mailed horse from horse</l>

      <l n="1122">Launched deadly forward . Shield to savage shield</l>
      <l n="1123">Opposing ; crest to crest , whose fronts did wield</l>
      <l n="1124">A towering war 's unmercifulest scath ;</l>
      <l n="1125">Rocking undaunted , glared wan withering wrath</l>
      <l n="1126">From balls of jeweled eyes , and raging stood</l>
      <l n="1127">Slim , slippery bodies , in the sun like blood .</l>
      <l n="1128">The lance of Accolon , as on a rock</l>
      <l n="1129">Long storm-launched foam breaks baffled , with the shock ,</l>
      <l n="1130">On Arthur 's sounding shield burst splintered force ;</l>

      <l n="1132">Sell-lifted ,— ruinous bare crashing on</l>
      <l n="1133">A long sword 's length ; unsaddled Accolon</l>
      <l n="1134">For one stunned moment lay . Then rising , drew</l>
      <l n="1135">The great sword at his hip , that shone like dew</l>
      <l n="1136">Fresh flashed in morn . “ Descend ; ” he stiffly said ,</l>

      <l n="1139">Addressed him to the King . Dismounting light ,</l>
      <l n="1140">Arthur his moon-bright brand unsheathed , and high</l>
      <l n="1141">Each covering shield gleamed slanting to the sky ,</l>
      <l n="1142">Relentless , strong , and stubborn ; underneath</l>
      <l n="1143">Their wary shelters foined the glittering death</l>
      <l n="1144">Of stolid steel thrust livid arm to arm :</l>
      <l n="1145">As cloud to cloud growls up a soaring storm</l>
      <l n="1146">Above the bleak wood and lithe lightnings work</l>
      <l n="1147">Brave blades wild warring , in the black that lurk ,</l>
      <l n="1148">Thus fenced and thrust — one tortoise shield descends ,</l>
      <l n="1149">Leaps a fierce sword shrill ,— like a flame which sends</l>
      <l n="1150">A long fang heavenward ,— for a crushing stroke ;</l>
      <l n="1151">Swings hard and trenchant , and , resounding heard ,</l>
      <l n="1152">Sings surly helmward full ; defiance reared</l>
      <l n="1153">Soars to a brother blow to shriek again</l>
      <l n="1154">Blade on brave blade . And o'er the battered plain ,</l>
      <l n="1155">Forward and backward , blade on baleful blade ,</l>
      <l n="1156">Teeth clenched as visors where the fierce eyes made</l>
      <l n="1157">A cavernous , smouldering fury , shield at shield ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="44">
      <l n="1159">So Arthur drew aside to rest upon</l>
      <l n="1160">His falchion for a pause ; but Accolon</l>
      <l n="1161">As yet , thro ’ virtue of that magic sheath</l>
      <l n="1162">Fresh and almighty , being no nearer death</l>
      <l n="1163">Thro ’ loss of blood than when the trial begun ,</l>
      <l n="1164">Chafed with delay . But Arthur with the sun ,</l>
      <l n="1165">Its thirsty heat , the loss from wounds of blood ,</l>
      <l n="1166">Leaned fainting weary and so resting stood .</l>
      <l n="1167">Cried Accolon , “ Here is no time for rest !</l>
      <l n="1168">Defend thee ! ” and straight on the monarch pressed ;</l>
      <l n="1169">“ Defend or yield thee as one recreant ! ”</l>
      <l n="1170">Full on his helm a hewing blow did plant ,</l>
      <l n="1171">Which beat a flying fire from the steel ;</l>
      <l n="1172">Smote , like one drunk with wine , the King did reel ,</l>
      <l n="1173">Breath , brain bewildered . Then , infuriate ,</l>
      <l n="1174">Nerve-stung with vigor by that blow , in hate</l>
      <l n="1175">Gnarled all his strength into one stroke of might ,</l>
      <l n="1176">And in both fists the huge blade knotted tight ,</l>
      <l n="1177">Swung red , terrific to a sundering stroke .—</l>
      <l n="1178">As some bright wind that hurls th ’ uprooted oak ,—</l>
      <l n="1179">Boomed full the beaten burgonet he wore :</l>
      <l n="1180">Hacked thro ’ and thro ’ the crest , and cleanly shore</l>
      <l n="1181">The golden boasting of its griffin fierce</l>
      <l n="1182">With hollow clamor down astounded ears :</l>
      <l n="1183">No further thence — but , shattered to the grass ,</l>
      <l n="1184">That brittle blade , crushed as if made of glass ,</l>
      <l n="1185">Into hot pieces like a broken ray</l>
      <l n="1186">Burst sunward and in feverish fragments lay .</l>
      <l n="1187">Then groaned the King unarmed ; and so he knew</l>
      <l n="1188">This no Excalibur ; that tried and true</l>
      <l n="1189">Most perfect tempered , runed and mystical .</l>
      <l n="1190">Sobbed , “ Oh , hell-false ! betray me ? ” — Then withal</l>
      <l n="1191">Him seemed this foe , who fought with so much stress ,</l>
      <l n="1192">So long untiring , and with no distress</l>
      <l n="1193">Of wounds or heat , through treachery bare his brand ;</l>
      <l n="1194">And then he knew it by its hilt that hand</l>
      <l n="1195">Clutched to an avenging stroke . For Accolon</l>
      <l n="1196">In madness urged the belted battle on</l>
      <l n="1197">His King defenseless ; who , the hilted cross</l>
      <l n="1198">Of that false weapon grasped , beneath the boss</l>
      <l n="1199">Of his deep-dented shield crouched ; and around</l>
      <l n="1200">Crawled the unequal conflict o'er the ground ,</l>
      <l n="1201">Sharded with shattered spears and off-hewn bits</l>
      <l n="1202">Of shivered steel and gold that burnt in fits .</l>
      <l n="1203">So hunted , yet defiant , cowering</l>
      <l n="1204">Beneath his bossy shield 's defense , the King</l>
      <l n="1205">Persisted stoutly . And , devising still</l>
      <l n="1206">How to secure his sword and by what skill ,</l>
      <l n="1207">Him so it fortuned when most desperate :</l>
      <l n="1208">In that hot chase they came where shattered late</l>
      <l n="1209">Lay tossed the truncheon of a bursten lance ,</l>
      <l n="1210">Which deftly seized , to Accolon 's advance</l>
      <l n="1211">He wielded valorous . Against the fist</l>
      <l n="1212">Smote where the gauntlet husked the nervous wrist ,</l>
      <l n="1213">Which strained the weapon to a wrathful blow ;</l>
      <l n="1214">Palsied , the tightened sinews of his foe</l>
      <l n="1215">Loosened from effort , and , the falchion seized ,</l>
      <l n="1216">Easy was yielded . Then the wroth King squeezed ,</l>
      <l n="1217">— Hurling the moon-disk of his shield afar ,—</l>
      <l n="1218">Him in both knotted arms of wiry war ,</l>
      <l n="1219">Rocked sidewise twice or thrice ,— as one hath seen</l>
      <l n="1220">Some stern storm take an ash tree , roaring green ,</l>
      <l n="1221">Nodding its sappy bulk of trunk and boughs</l>
      <l n="1222">To dizziness , from tough , coiled roots carouse</l>
      <l n="1223">Its long height thundering ;— so King Arthur shook</l>
      <l n="1224">Sir Accolon and headlong flung ; then took ,</l>
      <l n="1225">Tearing away , that scabbard from his side ,</l>
      <l n="1226">Tossed thro ’ the breathless lists , that far and wide</l>
      <l n="1227">Gulped in the battle voiceless . Then right wroth</l>
      <l n="1228">Secured Excalibur , and grasped of both</l>
      <l n="1229">Wild hands swung glittering and brought bitter down</l>
      <l n="1230">On rising Accolon ; steel , bone and brawn</l>
      <l n="1231">Hewed thro ’ that blow ; unsettled every sense :</l>
      <l n="1232">Bathed in a world of blood his limbs grew tense</l>
      <l n="1233">And writhen then ungathered limp with death .</l>
      <l n="1234">Bent to him Arthur , from the brow beneath ,</l>
      <l n="1235">Unlaced the helm and doffed it and so asked ,</l>
      <l n="1236">When the fair forehead 's hair curled dark uncasqued ,</l>
      <l n="1237">“ Say ! ere I slay thee , whence and what thou art ?</l>
      <l n="1238">What King , what court be thine ? and from what part ,</l>
      <l n="1239">Speak ! or thou diest !— Yet , that brow , methinks</l>
      <l n="1240">I have beheld it — where ? say , ere death drinks</l>
      <l n="1241">The soul-light from life 's cups , thine eyes ! thou art —</l>
      <l n="1242">What art thou , speak ! ”</l>
      <l n="1243">He answered slow and short</l>
      <l n="1244">With tortured breathing : “ I ?— one , Accolon</l>

      <l n="1247">Then seemed the victor spasmed with keen pain ,</l>
      <l n="1248">Covered with mailed hands his visored face ;</l>
      <l n="1249">“ Thou Accolon ? art Accolon ? ” a space</l>
      <l n="1250">Exclaimed and conned him : then asked softly , “ Say ,</l>

      <l n="1252">Thou hadst it , speak ? ” But wandering that knight</l>
      <l n="1253">Heard dully , senses clodded thick with night ;</l>
      <l n="1254">Then rallying earthward : “ Woe , woe worth the sword !</l>

      <l n="1274">To me , that woman , brighter than a flame ;</l>

      <l n="1319">Of carrion ravens and wild hawks the craws .</l>
      <l n="1320">Thus much for Damas . But our pleasure draws</l>
      <l n="1321">Toward sir Ontzlake , whom it likes the King</l>
      <l n="1322">To take into his knightly following</l>

      <l n="1509">On one milk , marvelous arm of fluid grace ,</l>
      <l n="1510">Beheld the brute thing throttled and the face</l>

      <l n="1561">Of nice words fairly fitted forming on ,—</l>
      <l n="1562">A sudden ceasing and the harmony gone ,</l>
      <l n="1563">So ran to death the life of Urience ,</l>
      <l n="1564">A strong song incomplete of broken sense .</l>
      <l n="1565">There glowered the crimeful Queen . The glistening sword</l>
      <l n="1566">Unfleshed , flung by her wronged and murdered lord ;</l>
      <l n="1567">And the dark blood spread broader thro ’ the sheet</l>
      <l n="1568">To drip a horror at impassive feet</l>
      <l n="1569">And blur the polished oak . But lofty she</l>
      <l n="1570">Stood proud , relentless ; in her ecstacy</l>
      <l n="1571">A lovely devil ; a crowned lust that cried</l>
      <l n="1572">On Accolon ; that harlot which defied</l>
      <l n="1573">Heaven with a voice of pulses clamorous as</l>
      <l n="1574">Steep storm that down a cavernous mountain pass</l>
      <l n="1575">Blasphemes an hundred echoes ; with like power</l>
      <l n="1576">The inner harlot called its paramour :</l>
      <l n="1577">Him whom King Arthur had commanded , when</l>
      <l n="1578">Borne from the lists , be granted her again</l>
      <l n="1579">As his blithe gift and welcome from that joust ,</l>
      <l n="1580">For treacherous love and her adulterous lust .</l>
      <l n="1581">And while she stood revolving how her deed 's</l>
      <l n="1582">Concealment were secured ,— a grind of steeds ,</l>
      <l n="1583">Arms , jingling stirrups , voices loud that cursed</l>
      <l n="1584">Fierce in the northern court . To her athirst</l>
      <l n="1585">For him her lover , war and power it spoke ,</l>
      <l n="1586">Him victor and so King ; and then awoke</l>
      <l n="1587">A yearning to behold , to quit the dead .</l>
      <l n="1588">So a wild specter down wide stairs she fled ,</l>
      <l n="1589">Burst on a glare of links and glittering mail ,</l>
      <l n="1590">That shrunk her eyes and made her senses quail .</l>
      <l n="1591">To her a bulk of iron , bearded fierce ,</l>
      <l n="1592">Down from a steaming steed into her ears ,</l>
      <l n="1593">“ This from the King , a boon ! ” laughed harsh and hoarse ;</l>
      <l n="1594">Two henchmen beckoned , who pitched sheer with force ,</l>
      <l n="1595">Loud clanging at her feet , hacked , hewn and red ,</l>
      <l n="1596">Crusted with blood a knight in armor — dead ;</l>
      <l n="1597">Even Accolon , tossed with the mocking scoff</l>
      <l n="1598">“ This from the King ! ” — phantoms in fog rode off .</l>
      <l n="1599">And what remains ? From Camelot to Gore</l>
      <l n="1600">That right she weeping fled ; then to the shore ,—</l>
      <l n="1601">As that romancer tells ,— Avilion ,</l>
      <l n="1602">Where she hath Majesty gold-crowned yet wan ;</l>
      <l n="1603">In darkest cypress a frail pitious face</l>
      <l n="1604">Queenly and lovely ; ‘ round sad eyes the trace</l>
      <l n="1605">Of immemorial tears as for some crime :</l>
      <l n="1606">They future fixed , expectant of the time</l>
      <l n="1607">When the forgiving Arthur cometh and</l>
      <l n="1608">Shall have to rule all that lost golden land</l>
      <l n="1609">That drifts vague amber in forgotten seas</l>
      <l n="1610">Of surgeless turquoise dim with mysteries .</l>
      <l n="1611">And so was seen Morgana nevermore ,</l>
      <l n="1612">Save once when from the Cornwall coast she bore</l>
      <l n="1613">The wounded Arthur from that last fought fight</l>
      <l n="1614">Of Camlan in a black barge into night .</l>
      <l n="1615">But oft some see her with a palfried band</l>
      <l n="1616">Of serge-stoled maidens thro ’ the drowsy land</l>
      <l n="1617">Of Autumn glimmer ; when are sharply strewn</l>
      <l n="1618">The red leaves , while broad in the east a moon</l>
      <l n="1619">Swings full of frost a lustrous globe of gleams ,</l>
      <l n="1620">Faint on the mooning hills as shapes in dreams .</l>

     <l n="3">He ? why , a tall Franconian strong and young ,</l>
     <l n="4">Brown as a walnut the first frost hath hulled ;</l>
     <l n="5">A soul of full endeavor powerful</l>
     <l n="6">Bound in lithe limbs , knit into grace and strength</l>
     <l n="7">Of bronze-like muscles elegant , that poised</l>
     <l n="8">A head like Hope 's ; and then the manly lines</l>
     <l n="9">Of face developed by action and mobile</l>
     <l n="10">To each suggestive impulse of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="11">Of smiles of buoyancy or scowls of gloom .—</l>
     <l n="12">And what deep eyes were his !— Aye ; I can see</l>
     <l n="13">Their wild and restless disks of luminous night</l>
     <l n="14">Instinct with haughtiness that sneered at Fate ,</l>
     <l n="15">Glared cold conclusion to all circumstance ,</l>
     <l n="16">As with loud law , to his advantage swift :</l>
     <l n="17">With scorn derisive that shot out a barb ,</l>
     <l n="18">Stabbed Superstition to its dagger hilt ;</l>
     <l n="19">That smiled a thrust-like smile which curled the lip ,</l>
     <l n="20">A vicious heresy with incredible lore ,</l>
     <l n="21">When God 's or holy Mary 's name came forth</l>
     <l n="22">Exclaimed in reverence or astonishment ;</l>
     <l n="23">And then would say ,</l>

     <l n="40">Shrines while they prayer him love 's obedience .</l>
     <l n="41">Are all not children of the same weak mold ?</l>
     <l n="42">Clay of His Adam-modeled clay made quick ?</l>
     <l n="43">Endowed with the like hopes , loves , fears and hates ,</l>
     <l n="44">Our mother 's weaknesses ? And these , forsooth ,</l>

     <l n="49">Through God ! great gods incarnate of his kind ! ’</l>
     <l n="50">— Omnipotent Wrong-representatives !</l>
     <l n="51">With might that blasts the world with wars and wrings</l>
     <l n="52">Groans from pale Nations with hell 's tyranny .</l>
     <l n="53">So to my mind real monarch only he —</l>

     <l n="61">If all that 's joy engulf you when it is . ”</l>
     <l n="62">And laughed an oily laugh of easy jest</l>
     <l n="63">To bow out God and hand the Devil in .—</l>
     <l n="64">I met him here at Ammendorf one Spring ,</l>
     <l n="65">Toward the close of April when the Harz ,</l>
     <l n="66">Veined to their ruin-crested summits , pulsed</l>
     <l n="67">A fluid life of green and budded gold</l>
     <l n="68">Beneath pure breathing skies of boundless blue :</l>
     <l n="69">Where low-yoked oxen , yellow to the knees ,</l>
     <l n="70">Along the fluted meadow , freshly ploughed ,</l>
     <l n="71">Plodded and snuffed the fragrance of the soil ,</l>
     <l n="72">The free bird sang exultant in the sun .</l>
     <l n="73">Triumphant Spring with hinted hopes of May</l>
     <l n="74">And jaunty June , her mouth a puckered rose .</l>
     <l n="75">Here at this very hostelery o ’ The Owl ;</l>
     <l n="76">Mine host there sleek served cannikins of wine</l>
     <l n="77">Beneath that elm now touseled by that shrew ,</l>
     <l n="78">Lean Winter . Well !— a lordly vintage that !</l>
     <l n="79">With tang of fires which had sucked out their soul</l>
     <l n="80">From feverish sun-vats , cooled it from the moon 's ;</l>
     <l n="81">From wine-skin bellies of the bursting grape</l>
     <l n="82">Trodden , in darkness of old cellars aged</l>
     <l n="83">Even to the tingling smack of olden earth .</l>
     <l n="84">Rich ! I remember !— wine that spurred the blood —</l>
     <l n="85">Thou hast none such , I swear , nor wilt again !—</l>
     <l n="86">That brought the heart loud to the generous mouth ,</l>
     <l n="87">And made the eyes unlatticed casements whence</l>
     <l n="88">The good man 's soul laughed interested out .</l>
     <l n="89">Stoups of rare royal Rhenish , such they say</l>
     <l n="90">As Necromance hides guarded in vast casks</l>
     <l n="91">Of antique make far in the Kyffhaeuser ,</l>
     <l n="92">The Cellar of the Knights near Sittendorf .</l>
     <l n="93">So , mellowed by that wine to friendship frank ,</l>
     <l n="94">He spake me his intent in coming here ;</l>
     <l n="95">But not one word of what his parentage ;</l>
     <l n="96">But this his name was , Rudolf , and his home ,</l>
     <l n="97">Franconia ; but nor why he left nor when :</l>
     <l n="98">His mind to live a forester and be</l>
     <l n="99">Enfellowed in the Duke of Brunswick 's train</l>
     <l n="100">Of buff and green ; and so to his estate</l>
     <l n="101">Even now was bound , a youth of twenty-three .</l>
     <l n="102">And when he ceased the fire in his eyes</l>
     <l n="103">Worked restless as a troubled animal 's ,</l>
     <l n="104">Which hate-enraged can burn a steady flame ,</l>
     <l n="105">Brute merciless . And thus I mused with me ,</l>
     <l n="106">When he had ceased to fulminate at state ,</l>
     <l n="107">“ Another Count von Hackelnburg the fiend</l>
     <l n="108">Hath tricked unto the chase !— for hounds from Hell ? ”</l>
     <l n="109">But answered nothing , save light words of cheer</l>
     <l n="110">As best become fleet friends warm wine doth make .</l>
     <l n="111">Then as it chanced , old Kurt had come that morn</l>
     <l n="112">With some six of his jerkined foresters</l>
     <l n="113">From the Thuringian forest ; damp with dew ;</l>
     <l n="114">Red-cheeked as morn with early travel ; bound</l>
     <l n="115">For Brunswick , Dummburg and the Hakel passed .</l>
     <l n="116">Chief huntsman he then to the goodly Duke ,</l>
     <l n="117">And father of the sunniest maiden here</l>
     <l n="118">In Ammendorf , the blameless Ilsabe ;</l>
     <l n="119">Who , motherless , the white-haired father prized</l>
     <l n="120">A jewel priceless . As huge barons ’ ghosts</l>
     <l n="121">Guard big , accumulated hoards of wealth ,</l>
     <l n="122">Fast-sealed in caverned cellars , robber wells ,</l>
     <l n="123">Beneath the dungeoned Dummburg , so he watched</l>
     <l n="124">Her , all his world in her who was his wealth .</l>
     <l n="125">A second Lora of Thuringia she .</l>
     <l n="126">Faultless for love , instilled all souls with love ,</l>
     <l n="127">Who , in the favor of her maiden smile ,</l>
     <l n="128">Felt friendship grow up like a golden thought ;</l>
     <l n="129">A life of love from words ; and light that fell</l>
     <l n="130">And wrought calm influence from her pure blue eyes .</l>
     <l n="131">Hair sedate and austerely dressed o'er brows</l>
     <l n="132">White as a Harz dove 's wing ; hair with the hue</l>
     <l n="133">Of twilight mists the sun hath soaked with gold .</l>
     <l n="134">A Tyrolean melody that brought</l>
     <l n="135">Dim dreams of Alpine heights , of shepherds brown ,</l>
     <l n="136">Goat-skinned , with healthy cheeks and wrinkled lips</l>
     <l n="137">That fill wild oaten pipes on wand'ring ways ,</l>
     <l n="138">Embowered deep , with mountain melodies ,—</l>
     <l n="139">Simple with love and plaintive even to tears ,—</l>
     <l n="140">Her presence , her sweet presence like a song .</l>
     <l n="141">And when she left , it was as when one hath</l>
     <l n="142">Beheld a moonlit Undine , ere the mind</l>
     <l n="143">Adjusts one thought , cleave thro ’ the glassy Rhine</l>
     <l n="144">A glittering beauty wet , and gone again</l>
     <l n="145">A flash — the soul drifts wondering on in dreams .</l>
     <l n="146">Some thirty years agone is that ; and I ,</l>
     <l n="147">Commissioner of the Duke — no sinecure</l>
     <l n="148">I can assure you — had scarce reached the age</l>
     <l n="149">Of thirty ( then some three years of that House ) .</l>
     <l n="150">Thro ’ me the bold Franconian , whom at first ,</l>
     <l n="151">By bitter principles and scorn of state —</l>
     <l n="152">Developed into argument thro ’ wine —</l>
     <l n="153">The foresthood like was to be denied ,</l>
     <l n="154">Was then enfellowed . “ Yes , ” I said , “ he 's young ;</l>
     <l n="155">True , rashly young ! yet , see : a wiry frame ,</l>
     <l n="156">A chamois ’ footing , and a face for right ;</l>
     <l n="157">An eye which likes me not , but quick with pride ,</l>
     <l n="158">And aimed at thought , a butt it may not miss :</l>
     <l n="159">A soul with virgin virtues which crude flesh</l>
     <l n="160">Makes seem but vices , these but God may see —</l>
     <l n="161">Develop these . But , if there 's aught of worth ,</l>
     <l n="162">Body or mind , in him , Kurt , thou wilt know ,</l>
     <l n="163">And to the surface wear , as divers win</l>
     <l n="164">From hideous ooze and life rich jewels lost</l>
     <l n="165">Of polished pureness , worthless left to night ,</l>
     <l n="166">Thou or thy daughter , and inspire for good . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="167">A year thereafter was it that I heard</l>
     <l n="168">Of Rudolf 's passion for Kurt 's Ilsabe ,</l>
     <l n="169">Then their betrothal . And it was from this ,—</l>
     <l n="170">For , ah , that Ilsabe ! that Ilsabe !—</l>
     <l n="171">Good Mary Mother ! how she haunts me yet !</l>
     <l n="172">She , that true touchstone which philosophers feign</l>
     <l n="173">Contacts and golds all base ; a woman who</l>
     <l n="174">Could touch all evil into good in man .—</l>
     <l n="175">Surmised I of the excellency which</l>
     <l n="176">Refinement of her gentle company ,</l>
     <l n="177">Warm presence of chaste beauty , had resolved</l>
     <l n="178">His fiery nature to , conditioning slave .</l>
     <l n="179">And so I came from Brunswick — as you know —</l>
     <l n="180">Is custom of the Duke or , by his seal</l>
     <l n="181">Commissioned proxy , his commissioner ,—</l>
     <l n="182">To test the marksmanship of Rudolf who</l>
     <l n="183">Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child ,</l>
     <l n="184">An heir of Kuno .— He ?— Great grandfather</l>
     <l n="185">Of Kurt , and one this forestkeepership</l>
     <l n="186">Was first possesor of ; established thus —</l>
     <l n="187">Or such the tale they told me ‘ round the hearths .</l>
     <l n="188">Kuno , once in the Knight of Wippach 's train ,</l>
     <l n="189">Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke , who came</l>
     <l n="190">With vast magnificence of knights and hounds ,</l>
     <l n="191">And satin-tuniced nobles curled and plumed</l>
     <l n="192">To hunt Thuringian deer . Then Morn too slow</l>
     <l n="193">On her blithe feet was ; quick with laughing eyes</l>
     <l n="194">To morrow mortal eyes and lazy limbs ;</l>
     <l n="195">Rather on tip-toed hills recumbent yawned ,</l>
     <l n="196">Aroused an hour too soon ; ashamed , disrobed ,</l>
     <l n="197">Rubbed the stiff sleep from eyes that still would close ,</l>
     <l n="198">While brayed the hollow horns and bayed lean hounds ,</l>
     <l n="199">And cheered gallants until the dingles dinned ,</l>
     <l n="200">Where searched the climbing mists or , compact light ,</l>
     <l n="201">Fled breathless white , clung scared a moted gray ,</l>
     <l n="202">Low unsunned cloudlands of the castled hills .</l>
     <l n="203">And then near mid-noon from a swarthy brake</l>
     <l n="204">The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag ,</l>
     <l n="205">Lashed to whose back with grinding knotted cords ,</l>
     <l n="206">Borne with whom like a nightmare 's incubus ,</l>
     <l n="207">A man shrieked ; burry-bearded and his hair</l>
     <l n="208">Kinked with dry , tangled burrs , and he himself</l>
     <l n="209">Emaciated and half naked . From</l>
     <l n="210">The wear of wildest passage thro ’ the wild ,</l>
     <l n="211">Rent red by briars , torn and bruised by rocks .</l>
     <l n="212">— For , such the law then , when the peasant chased</l>
     <l n="213">Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords ,</l>
     <l n="214">As punishment the torturing withes and spine</l>
     <l n="215">Of some big stag , a gift of game and wild</l>
     <l n="216">Enough till death — death in the antlered herd</l>
     <l n="217">Or crawling famine in bleak , haggard haunts .</l>
     <l n="218">Then was the dark Duke glad , and forthwith cried</l>
     <l n="219">To all his dewy train a rich reward</l>
     <l n="220">For him who slew the stag and saved the man ,</l>
     <l n="221">But death to him who slew the man and stag ,</l>
     <l n="222">The careless error of a loose attempt .</l>
     <l n="223">So crashed the hunt along wild , glimmering ways</l>
     <l n="224">Thro ’ creepers and vast brush beneath gnarled trees ,</l>
     <l n="225">Up a scorched torrent 's bed . Yet still refused</l>
     <l n="226">Each that sure shot ; the risk too desperate</l>
     <l n="227">The poor life and the golden gift beside .</l>
     <l n="228">So this young Kuno with two eyes wherein</l>
     <l n="229">Hunt with excitement kindled reckless fire</l>
     <l n="230">Clamored , “ And are ye cowards ?— Good your grace ,</l>
     <l n="231">You shall not chafe !— The fiend direct my ball ! ”</l>
     <l n="232">And fired into a covert deeply packed ,</l>
     <l n="233">An intertangled wall of matted night ,</l>
     <l n="234">Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive</l>
     <l n="235">To pierce one foot or earn one point beyond .</l>
     <l n="236">But , ha ! the huge stag staggered from the brake</l>
     <l n="237">Heart-hit and perished . That wan wretch unhurt</l>
     <l n="238">Soon bondless lay condoled . But the great Duke ,</l>
     <l n="239">Charmed with the eagle shot , admired the youth ,</l>
     <l n="240">There to him and his heirs forever gave</l>
     <l n="241">The forest keepership .</l>
     <l n="242">But envious tongues</l>
     <l n="243">Were soon at wag ; and whispered went the tale</l>
     <l n="244">Of how the shot was free , and that the balls</l>
     <l n="245">Used by young Kuno were free bullets , which</l>
     <l n="246">Molded were cast in influence of the fiend</l>
     <l n="247">By magic and directed by the fiend .</l>
     <l n="248">Of some effect these tales were and some force</l>
     <l n="249">Had with the Duke , who lent an ear so far</l>
     <l n="250">As to ordain Kuno 's descendants all</l>
     <l n="251">To proof of skill ere their succession to</l>
     <l n="252">The father 's office . Kurt himself hath shot</l>
     <l n="253">The silver ring from out the popinjay 's beak —</l>
     <l n="254">A good shot he , you see , who would succeed .</l>
     <l n="255">The Devil guards his mysteries close as God .</l>
     <l n="256">For who can say what elementaries</l>
     <l n="257">Demoniac lurk in desolate dells and woods</l>
     <l n="258">Shadowy ? malicious vassals of that power</l>
     <l n="259">Who signs himself , thro ’ these , a slave to those ,</l>
     <l n="260">Those mortals who act open with his Hell ,</l>
     <l n="261">Those only who seek secretly and woo .</l>
     <l n="262">Of these free , fatal bullets let me speak :</l>
     <l n="263">There may be such ; our Earth hath things as strange ;</l>
     <l n="264">Then only in coarse fancies may exist ;</l>
     <l n="265">For fancy is among our peasantry</l>
     <l n="266">A limber juggler with the weird and dark ;</l>
     <l n="267">For Superstition hides not her grim face ,</l>
     <l n="268">A skeleton grin on leprous ghastliness ,</l>
     <l n="269">From Ignorance 's mossy thatches low .</l>
     <l n="270">A cross-way , as I heard , among gaunt hills ,</l>
     <l n="271">A solitude convulsed of rocks and trees</l>
     <l n="272">Blasted ; and on the stony cross-road drawn</l>
     <l n="273">A bloody circle with a bloody sword ;</l>
     <l n="274">Herein rude characters ; a skull and thighs</l>
     <l n="275">Fantastic fixed before a fitful fire</l>
     <l n="276">Of spiteful coals . Eleven of the clock</l>
     <l n="277">Cast , the first bullet leaves the mold ,— the lead</l>
     <l n="278">Mixed with three bullets that have hit their mark ,</l>
     <l n="279">Burnt blood ,— the wounded Sacramental Host ,</l>
     <l n="280">Unswallowed and unhallowed , oozed when shot</l>
     <l n="281">Fixed to a riven pine .— Ere twelve o'clock ,</l>

     <l n="283">Quit musty tombs to mumble hollow woes</l>
     <l n="284">In Midnight 's horrored ear , with never a cry ,</l>
     <l n="285">Word or weak whisper , till that hour sound ,</l>
     <l n="286">Must the free balls be cast ; and these shall be</l>
     <l n="287">In number three and sixty ; three of which</l>
     <l n="288">Semial — he the Devil 's minister —</l>
     <l n="289">Claims for his master and stamps as his own</l>
     <l n="290">To hit awry their mark , askew for harm .</l>
     <l n="291">Those other sixty shall not miss their mark .</l>
     <l n="292">No cry , no word , no whisper , tho ’ there gibe</l>
     <l n="293">Most monstrous shapes that flicker in thick mist</l>
     <l n="294">Lewd human countenances or leer out</l>
     <l n="295">Swoln animal faces with fair forms of men ,</l>
     <l n="296">While wide-winged owls fan the drear , dying coals ,</l>
     <l n="297">That lick thin , slender tongues of purple fire</l>
     <l n="298">From viperous red , and croaks the night-hawk near .</l>
     <l n="299">No cry , no word , no whisper should there come</l>

     <l n="302">Faded with tears of waiting ; beckoning</l>
     <l n="303">With gray , large arms or censuring ; her shame</l>
     <l n="304">In dull and desolate eyes ; who , if you speak</l>
     <l n="305">Or stagger from that circle — hideous change !—</l>
     <l n="306">Shrinks , faced a hag of million wrinkles , which</l>
     <l n="307">Ridge scaly sharpness of protruding bones ,</l>
     <l n="308">To rip you limb from limb with taloned claws .</l>
     <l n="309">Nor be deceived if some far midnight bell</l>
     <l n="310">Boom that anticipated hour , nor leave</l>
     <l n="311">By one short inch the bloody orbit , for</l>
     <l n="312">The minion varlets of Hell 's majesty</l>
     <l n="313">Expectant cirque its dim circumference .</l>
     <l n="314">But when the hour of midnight smites , be sure</l>
     <l n="315">You have your bullets , neither more nor less ;</l>
     <l n="316">For , if thro ’ fear one more or less you have ,</l>
     <l n="317">Your soul is forfeit to those agencies ,</l>
     <l n="318">Right rathe who are to rend it from the flesh .</l>
     <l n="319">And while that hour of midnight sounds a din</l>
     <l n="320">Of hurrying hoofs and shouting outriders —</l>
     <l n="321">Six snorting steeds postilioned roll a stage</l>
     <l n="322">Black and with groaning wheels of spinning fire ,</l>
     <l n="323">“ Room there !— ho ! ho !— who bars the mountain-way !</l>
     <l n="324">On over him ! ” — but fear not nor fare forth ,—</l>
     <l n="325">‘ Tis but the last trick of your bounden slave :</l>
     <l n="326">And ere the red moon strives from dingy clouds</l>
     <l n="327">And dives again , high the huge leaders leap</l>
     <l n="328">Iron fore-hoofs flashing and big eyes like gledes ,</l>
     <l n="329">And , spun a spiral spark into the night ,</l>
     <l n="330">Whistling the phantom flies and fades away .</l>
     <l n="331">Some say there comes no stage , but Hackelnburg ,</l>
     <l n="332">Wild Huntsman of the Harz , rides hoarse in storm ,</l>
     <l n="333">Dashing the dead leaves with dark dogs of hell</l>
     <l n="334">Direful thro ’ whirling thickets , and his horn</l>
     <l n="335">Croaks doleful as an owl 's hoot while he hurls</l>
     <l n="336">Straight ‘ neath rain-streaming skies of echoes , sheer</l>
     <l n="337">Plunging the magic circle horse and hounds .</l>
     <l n="338">And then will come , plutonian clad and slim ,</l>
     <l n="339">Upon a stallion vast intensely black ,</l>
     <l n="340">Semial , Satan 's lurid minister ,</l>
     <l n="341">To hail you and inform you and assure .—</l>
     <l n="342">Enough ! these wives-tales heard to what I 've seen ;</l>
     <l n="343">To Ammendorf I came ; and Rudolf there</l>
     <l n="344">With Kurt and all his picturesque foresters</l>
     <l n="345">Met me . And then the rounding year was ripe ;</l>
     <l n="346">Throbbing the red heart of full Autumn : When</l>
     <l n="347">Each morning gleams crisp frost on shriveled fields ;</l>
     <l n="348">Each noon sits veiled in mysteries of mist ;</l>
     <l n="349">Each night unrolls a miracle woof of stars ,</l>
     <l n="350">Where moon — bare-bosomed goddess of the hunt —</l>
     <l n="351">Wades calm , crushed clouds or treads the vaster blue .</l>
     <l n="352">Then I proposed the season 's hunt ; till eve</l>
     <l n="353">The test of Rudolf 's skill postponed , with which</l>
     <l n="354">Annoyed he seemed . And so it was I heard</l>
     <l n="355">How he an execrable marksman was ,</l>
     <l n="356">And whispered tales of near , incredible shots</l>
     <l n="357">That wryed their mark , while in his flint-lock 's pan</l>
     <l n="358">Flashed often harmless powder , while wild game</l>
     <l n="359">Stared fearless on him and indulgent stood ,</l>
     <l n="360">An open butt to such wide marksmanship .</l>
     <l n="361">Howbeit , he that day acquitted him</l>
     <l n="362">Of these maligners ’ cavils ; in the hunt</l>
     <l n="363">Missing no shot however rash he made</l>
     <l n="364">Or distant thro ’ thick intercepting trees ;</l>
     <l n="365">And the piled , curious game brought down of all</l>
     <l n="366">Good marksmen of that train had not sufficed ,</l>
     <l n="367">Doubled , nay , trebled , to have matched his heap .</l>
     <l n="368">And wonderstruck the jaegers saw , nor knew</l>
     <l n="369">How to excuse them . My indulgence giv'n ,</l>
     <l n="370">Still swore that only yesterday old Kurt</l>
     <l n="371">Had touched his daughter 's tears and Rudolf 's wrath</l>
     <l n="372">By vowing end to their betrothed love ,</l>
     <l n="373">Unless that love developed better aim</l>
     <l n="374">Against the morrow 's test ; his ancestor 's</l>
     <l n="375">High fame should not be damaged . So he stormed ,</l>
     <l n="376">But bowed his gray head and wept silently ;</l>
     <l n="377">Then looking up forgave when big he saw</l>
     <l n="378">Tears in his daughter 's eyes and Rudolf gone</l>
     <l n="379">Forth in the night that wailed with coming storm .</l>
     <l n="380">Before this inn , The Owl , assembled came</l>
     <l n="381">The nice-primped villagers to view the trial :</l>
     <l n="382">Fair fraeuleins and blonde , comely , healthy fraus ;</l>
     <l n="383">Stout burgers . And among them I did mark</l>
     <l n="384">Kurt and his daughter . He , a florid face</l>
     <l n="385">Of pride and joy for Rudolf 's strange success ;</l>
     <l n="386">She , radiant and flounced in flowing garb</l>
     <l n="387">Of bridal white deep-draped and crowned with flowers ;</l>
     <l n="388">For Kurt insisted this their marriage eve</l>
     <l n="389">Should Rudolf come successful from the chase .</l>
     <l n="390">So pleased was I with what I 'd seen him do ,</l>
     <l n="391">The test of skill superfluous seemed and so</l>
     <l n="392">Was on the bare brink of announcement , when ,</l>
     <l n="393">Out of the evening heaven 's hardening red ,</l>
     <l n="394">Like a white warning loosed for augury ,</l>
     <l n="395">A word of God some fallen angel prized</l>
     <l n="396">As his last all of heaven , penitent ,</l>
     <l n="397">Hell-freed , sent minister to save a soul ,</l>
     <l n="398">A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there ,</l>
     <l n="399">A wafted waif , pruned settled on a bough :</l>
     <l n="400">Then I , “ Thy weapon , Rudolph , pierce its head ! ”</l>
     <l n="401">Cried pointing , “ And chief-forester art thou ! ”</l>
     <l n="402">Pale as a mist and wavering he turned ;</l>
     <l n="403">“ I had a dream — ” then faltered as he aimed ,</l>
     <l n="404">“ A woman 's whim ! ” But starting from the press</l>
     <l n="405">Screamed Ilsabe , “ My dove ! ” to plead its life</l>
     <l n="406">Came — cracked the rifle and untouched the dove</l>
     <l n="407">Rose beating lustrous wings , but Ilsabe —</l>
     <l n="408">“ God 's wrath ! the sight ! ” — fell smitten , and the blood</l>
     <l n="409">Sprang red from shattered brow and silent hair —</l>
     <l n="410">That bullet strangely thro ’ her brow and brain ....</l>
     <l n="411">And what of Rudolf ? ah ! of him you ask ?</l>
     <l n="412">That proud Franconian who would scoff at Fate</l>
     <l n="413">And scorn all state ; who cried black Satan friend</l>
     <l n="414">Sooner than our white Christ ;— why , he went mad</l>
     <l n="415">O ’ the moment , and into the haunted Harz</l>
     <l n="416">Fled , an unholy thing , and perished there</l>
     <l n="417">The prey of demons of the Dummburg . But</l>
     <l n="418">I one of few less superstitious who</l>
     <l n="419">Say , as the finale of a madman 's deed ,</l>
     <l n="420">He in the Bode , from that ragged rock ,</l>
     <l n="421">The Devil 's Dancing Place , did leap and die .</l>

     <l n="2">Barbican , bartizan , battlement ,</l>
     <l n="3">With the Abergavenny mountains blent ,</l>
     <l n="4">Look , from the Raglan tower of Gwent ,</l>
     <l n="5">My lord Hugh Clifford 's ancient home</l>
     <l n="6">Shows , clear morns of the Spring or Summer ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thrust out like thin flakes o ’ a silver foam</l>
     <l n="8">From a climbing cloud , for the hills gloom glummer ,</l>
     <l n="9">Being shaggy with heath , yon .— I was his page ;</l>
     <l n="10">A favorite then ; and he of that age</l>
     <l n="11">When a man will love and be loved again ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or die in the wars or a monastery :</l>
     <l n="13">Or toil till he stifle his heart 's hard pain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or drink , drug his hopes and his lost love bury .</l>
     <l n="15">I was his page ; and often we fared</l>
     <l n="16">Thro ’ the Clare desmene in Autumn hawking —</l>
     <l n="17">If the baron had known how he would have glared</l>
     <l n="18">From their bushy brows eyes dark with mocking !</l>
     <l n="19">— That of the Strongbows , Richard , I mean —</l>
     <l n="20">Had growled to his yeomen , “ A score ! mount , Keene !</l>
     <l n="21">Forth and spit me this Clifford , or hang</l>
     <l n="22">With his crop-eared page to the closest oak ! ”</l>
     <l n="23">For he and the Cliffords had ever a fang</l>
     <l n="24">In the other 's side ,... but I see him choke</l>
     <l n="25">And strangle with wrath when his hawker told —</l>
     <l n="26">If he told !— how we met on that flowery wold</l>
     <l n="27">His daughter , sweet Hortense of Clare , the day</l>
     <l n="28">Her hooded tiercel its brails did burst</l>
     <l n="29">To trail with its galling jesses away ;</l>
     <l n="30">An untrained haggard the falconer cursed ,</l>
     <l n="31">Vain whistled to lure ; when the eyas sped</l>
     <l n="32">Slant , low and heavily overhead</l>
     <l n="33">By us ; and Sir Hugh ,— who had just then cast</l>
     <l n="34">His peregrine fierce at a heron-quarry ,—</l>
     <l n="35">In his stirrups rising , thus — as it passed ,</l>
     <l n="36">By the jesses caught and to her did carry ,</l>
     <l n="37">Lingering slender and tall by a rose</l>
     <l n="38">Whence she pulled the berries — But no two foes</l>
     <l n="39">Her eyes and Sir Hugh 's !— And I swear each felt</l>
     <l n="40">A song in their hearts !— For I heard him quaver</l>
     <l n="41">Somewhat and then — by Mary !— he knelt !—</l>
     <l n="42">And the Lady herself in her words did waver</l>
     <l n="43">And wonder with smiles . Then daintily took</l>
     <l n="44">The hawk on her fist where it pruned and shook</l>
     <l n="45">Its callowness ragged , as Hugh did seize</l>
     <l n="46">Softly the other hand long and white ,—</l>
     <l n="47">Reached forth to him craving him rise from his knees ,—</l>
     <l n="48">And mouthed with moist kisses an hundred quite .</l>
     <l n="49">Tho ’ she blushed up burning , no frowned “ Beware ! ”</l>
     <l n="50">But seemed so happy ! when crushing thro ’ —</l>
     <l n="51">Her sturdy retainer with swarthy stare —</l>
     <l n="52">The underwoods burst ; and her maiden crew</l>
     <l n="53">Drew near them naming her name , and came</l>
     <l n="54">With leaves and dim Autumn blossoms aflame .—</l>
     <l n="55">“ Their words ? ” I know not ! for how should I ?—</l>
     <l n="56">I paged my master but was no spy .</l>
     <l n="57">Nothings , I think , as all lovers ’ , you know ;</l>
     <l n="58">Yet how should I hear such whispered low ,</l>
     <l n="59">Quick by the wasted woodland yellow ?</l>
     <l n="60">When up thro ’ the brush thrashed that burly fellow</l>
     <l n="61">With his ale-coarse face , and so made a pause</l>
     <l n="62">In the pulse of their words , there my lord Sir Hugh</l>
     <l n="63">Stood with the soil on his knee : No cause</l>
     <l n="64">Had he — but his hanger he halfway drew —</l>
     <l n="65">Then paused , thrust it clap in its sheath again</l>
     <l n="66">And bowed to the Lady and strode away ;</l>
     <l n="67">Up , vault , on his steed — and we rode amain</l>
     <l n="68">Gay to his towers that merry day .</l>

     <l n="71">To ride in the Raglan marches and hawk</l>
     <l n="72">And to hunt and to wander . And found a lair ,</l>
     <l n="73">In the Strongbow forest , of bush and of rock ,</l>
     <l n="74">Of moss and thick ferns ; where Hortense of Clare ,</l>
     <l n="75">How often I wis not , met him by chance —</l>
     <l n="76">Perhaps !— Sweet sorceress out of romance ,</l>
     <l n="77">Those tomes of Geoffrey — for she was fair !</l>
     <l n="78">Her large , warm eyes and hair ,... ah , hair ,</l>
     <l n="79">How may one picture or liken it !</l>
     <l n="80">With the golden gloss of its full brown , fit</l>
     <l n="81">For the Viviane face of lovable white</l>
     <l n="82">Beneath ;— like a star that a cloud of night</l>

     <l n="85">Heigho !— but they ceased , those meetings . I wot</l>
     <l n="86">Watched of the baron , his menial crew ;</l>
     <l n="87">For she loved too well to have once forgot</l>
     <l n="88">The place and the time of their trysting true .</l>
     <l n="89">But she came not — ah ! and again came not :</l>
     <l n="90">“ Why and when ? ” would question Sir Hugh</l>

     <l n="93">Until near Yule Love gat them again</l>

     <l n="98">Smarted the cheek and chapped i ’ the blood ;</l>

     <l n="114">To her lover , the Clifford , she told this — there</l>
     <l n="115">He had faced with his love the talons of Death —</l>
     <l n="116">Only for her , who did stay with a stare</l>

     <l n="118">“ Is love , that thou sware to me aye and so often ,</l>

     <l n="165">Horses and all in the stinging snow .</l>
     <l n="166">Stiff with the cold was I .— Immortal</l>
     <l n="167">Minutes we waited breath-bated and listened</l>
     <l n="168">Shuddering there in the gusty gale .</l>
     <l n="169">Whizzing o'er parapets sifted and glistened</l>
     <l n="170">Wild drift , thro ’ battlements hissed in a veil .</l>
     <l n="171">Quoth my lord Sir Hugh , for his love was a-heat ,</l>

     <l n="177">One foot — then a pause — on the stair — So , Barb ,</l>
     <l n="178">So !— If the tempest that barks and pants</l>
     <l n="179">Would throttle itself with its yelps ! then I</l>

     <l n="183">But ever some whim of the wind that shook</l>
     <l n="184">The clanging ring of a creaking hook</l>
     <l n="185">In the buttress or wall ; and we waited so</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="187">I must tell you why , and enough : ‘ Tis said</l>

     <l n="190">With a mischievous laugh , “ I 'll hide ! I 'll hide !</l>
     <l n="191">Seek ! and be sure to seek well ! ” and led</l>
     <l n="192">A wild chase after her , but defied</l>
     <l n="193">All search for — a score and ten more years ,</l>
     <l n="194">And the laughter of Yule was changed to tears .</l>

    <head>ON THE JELLICO-SPUR .</head>
    <head>TO MY FRIEND , JOHN FOX , JR .</head>
     <l n="1">You remember , the deep mist ,—</l>
     <l n="2">Climbing to the Devil 's Den —</l>
     <l n="3">Blue beneath us in the glen</l>
     <l n="4">And above us amethyst ,</l>
     <l n="5">Throbbed and circled and away</l>
     <l n="6">Thro ’ the wild-woods opposite ,</l>
     <l n="7">Torn and shattered , morning-lit ,</l>
     <l n="8">Scurried up a dewy gray .</l>
     <l n="9">Vague as in Romance we saw</l>
     <l n="10">From the fog one riven trunk ,</l>
     <l n="11">Its huge horny talons shrunk ,</l>
     <l n="12">Thrust a hungry dragon 's claw .</l>
     <l n="13">And we climbed two hours thro ’</l>
     <l n="14">The dawn-dripping Jellicoes ,</l>
     <l n="15">To that wooded rock that shows</l>
     <l n="16">Undulating peaks of blue :</l>
     <l n="17">The vast Cumberlands that sleep ,</l>
     <l n="18">Weighed with soaring forests , far</l>
     <l n="19">To the concave welkin 's bar ,</l>
     <l n="20">Leagues on leagues of purple sweep .</l>
     <l n="21">Range exalted over range</l>
     <l n="22">Billowed their enormous spines ,</l>
     <l n="23">And we heard the priestly pines</l>
     <l n="24">Hum the wisdom of their change .</l>
     <l n="25">We were sons of Nature then ;</l>
     <l n="26">She had taken us to her ,</l>
     <l n="27">Closer drawn by brier and burr ,</l>
     <l n="28">There on lonely Devil 's Den .</l>
     <l n="29">We were pupils of her moods :</l>
     <l n="30">Taught the beauties of her loins</l>
     <l n="31">In those bloom-anointed coignes ,—</l>
     <l n="32">Love in her eternal woods :</l>
     <l n="33">How she bore or flower or bud ;</l>
     <l n="34">Pithed the wiry sapling-oak ;</l>
     <l n="35">In the long vine zeal awoke</l>
     <l n="36">Aye to climb a leafy flood .</l>
     <l n="37">Her waste fantasies of birth :</l>
     <l n="38">Sponge-like exudations fair —</l>
     <l n="39">Dainty fungi everywhere</l>
     <l n="40">Bulging from the loamy earth .</l>
     <l n="41">Coral-vegetable things ;</l>
     <l n="42">Crystals clamily exhaled ;</l>
     <l n="43">Bulbous , marble-ribbed and scaled ,</l>
     <l n="44">Vip'rous colored ; then close rings</l>
     <l n="45">Of the Indian Pipe that cleft</l>
     <l n="46">Pink and white the woodland lax ,—</l>
     <l n="47">Blossoms of a natural wax</l>
     <l n="48">The brown mountain-fairies left .</l>
     <l n="49">We on that parched precipice ,</l>
     <l n="50">Stretched beneath the chestnuts ’ burrs ,</l>
     <l n="51">Breathed the balsam of the firs ,</l>
     <l n="52">Felt the blue sky like a kiss .</l>
     <l n="53">Soft that heaven ; stainless as</l>
     <l n="54">The grand woodlands lunging on ,</l>
     <l n="55">Wound majestic in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="56">Or as our devotion was !</l>
     <l n="57">Freedom sat there cragged we saw ,</l>
     <l n="58">Freedom whom hoarse forests sang ;</l>
     <l n="59">Heaven-browed her eyes , whence sprang</l>
     <l n="60">Audience august with law .</l>
     <l n="61">Wildernesses , from her hips</l>
     <l n="62">Sprung the giant forests there ,</l>
     <l n="63">Tossed the cataracts from her hair ,</l>
     <l n="64">Thunders lightened from her lips .</l>
     <l n="65">Oft some scavenger , with vane</l>
     <l n="66">Motionless , above we knew</l>
     <l n="67">Wheeled thro ’ altitudes of blue</l>
     <l n="68">By his rapid shadow 's stain .</l>
     <l n="69">Or some cloud of sunny white ,—</l>
     <l n="70">Puffed a lazy drift of pearl ,—</l>
     <l n="71">Balmy breezes o'er would whirl</l>
     <l n="72">Shot with coruscating light .</l>
     <l n="73">So we dreamed an hour upon</l>
     <l n="74">Those warm rocks , dry , lichen-scabbed .</l>
     <l n="75">Lounged beneath long leaves that dabbed</l>
     <l n="76">At us coins of shade and sun .</l>
     <l n="77">Then arose and down some gorge</l>
     <l n="78">Made a bowldered torrent broad</l>
     <l n="79">The hurled pathway of our road</l>
     <l n="80">Tumbled down the mountain large .</l>
     <l n="81">At that farm-house , which you know ,</l>
     <l n="82">Where old-fashioned flowers spun</l>
     <l n="83">Gay rag-carpets in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="84">By green apple-boughs built low ,</l>
     <l n="85">Rested from our hot descent ;</l>
     <l n="86">One deep draught of cider cool ,</l>
     <l n="87">Unctuous , our fierce veins to dull</l>
     <l n="88">At old Hix 's eloquent ....</l>
     <l n="89">On Wolf Mountain died the light ;</l>
     <l n="90">A colossal blossom , rayed</l>
     <l n="91">With rent petaled clouds that played</l>
     <l n="92">‘ Round a calyxed fury bright .</l>
     <l n="93">Down the moist mint-scented vale</l>
     <l n="94">To the mining camp we turned ,</l>
     <l n="95">Thro ’ the twilight faint discerned</l>
     <l n="96">With its crowded cabins pale .</l>
     <l n="97">Ah ! those nights !— We wandered forth</l>
     <l n="98">On some shadow-haunted path</l>
     <l n="99">When the moon was late and rathe</l>
     <l n="100">The large stars ; sowed south and north ,</l>
     <l n="101">Clustered bursting heavens down :</l>
     <l n="102">And the milky zodiac ,</l>
     <l n="103">Rolled athwart the belted black ,</l>
     <l n="104">Myriad-million-moted shone .</l>
     <l n="105">And in dreams we sauntered till</l>
     <l n="106">In the valley pale beneath ,</l>
     <l n="107">From a dew-drop 's vapored breath</l>
     <l n="108">To faint ghosts , there gathered still ,</l>
     <l n="109">Grave creations weird of mist :</l>
     <l n="110">Then we knew the moonrise near ,</l>
     <l n="111">As with necromance the air</l>
     <l n="112">Pulsed to pearl and amethyst .</l>
     <l n="113">Shrilled the insects of the dusk ,</l>
     <l n="114">Grated , buzzed and strident sung</l>
     <l n="115">Till each leaf seemed tuned and strung</l>
     <l n="116">For high Pixy music brusque .</l>
     <l n="117">Stealing steps and stealthy sighs</l>
     <l n="118">As of near unhallowed things ,</l>
     <l n="119">Rustled hair or fluttered wings ,</l>
     <l n="120">Seemed about us ; then the eyes</l>
     <l n="121">Of plumed phantom warriors</l>
     <l n="122">Burned mesmeric from some bush</l>
     <l n="123">Mournful in the goblin hush ,</l>
     <l n="124">Then materialized to stars .</l>
     <l n="125">Mantled mists like ambushed braves ,</l>
     <l n="126">Chiefed by some swart Blackfoot tall ,</l>
     <l n="127">Stole along each forest wall —</l>
     <l n="128">Phosphorescent moony waves .</l>
     <l n="129">Then the moon rose ; from some cup</l>
     <l n="130">Each hill 's bowl ,— magnetic shine ,</l>
     <l n="131">Mist and silence poured like wine ,—</l>
     <l n="132">Brimmed a monster goblet up .</l>
     <l n="133">Ingot from lost orient mines ,</l>
     <l n="134">Delved by humpbacked gnomes of Night ,</l>
     <l n="135">Full her orb loomed , nacreous white ,</l>
     <l n="136">O'er Pine Mountain 's druid pines .</l>
     <l n="137">As thro ’ fragmentary fleece</l>
     <l n="138">Her circumference polished broke ,</l>
     <l n="139">Orey-seamed , about us woke</l>
     <l n="140">Myths of Italy and Greece .</l>
     <l n="141">Then — a chanson serenade —</l>
     <l n="142">You , rich-voiced , to your guitar</l>
     <l n="143">To our goddess in that star</l>
     <l n="144">Sang “ Ne Tempo ” from the glade .</l>
