Pure hangs the silver crescent Above the twilight wood , And pure the silver music Wakes from the marshy flood . O Earth , with all thy transport , How comes it life should seem A shadow in the moonlight , A murmur in a dream ?</p>

    <docImprint>PUBLISHERS —<settlement>TORONTO</settlement>Copyright ,<country>Canada</country>,<date>1921</date>By MCCLELLAND &amp; STEWART , Limited ,<settlement>TORONTO</settlement>First Printing<date>1921</date>Second "<date>1922</date>Third "<date>1922</date>Fourth "<date>1923</date>Printed in<country>Canada</country>Publisher 's Note The present volume is made up of poems from Mr. Carman 's three latest books , The Rough Rider , Echoes from Vagabondia , and April Airs , together with a number of more recent poems which have not before been issued in book form .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Bliss Carman : An Appreciation How many Canadians — how many even among the few who seek to keep themselves informed of the best in contemporary literature , who are ever on the alert for the new voices — realise , or even suspect , that this Northern land of theirs has produced a poet of whom it may be affirmed with confidence and assurance that he is of the great succession of English poets ? Yet such — strange and unbelievable though it may seem — is in very truth the case , that poet being ( to give him his full name ) William Bliss Carman . Canada has full right to be proud of her poets , a small body though they are ; but not only does Mr. Carman stand high and clear above them all — his place ( and time cannot but confirm and justify the assertion ) is among those men whose poetry is the shining glory of that great English literature which is our common heritage . If any should ask why , if what has been just said is so , there has been — as must be admitted — no general recognition of the fact in the poet 's home land , I would answer that there are various and plausible , if not good , reasons for it .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>First of all , the poet , as thousands more of our young men of ambition and confidence have done , went early to the<country>United States</country>, and until recently , except for rare and brief visits to his old home down by the sea , has never returned to<country>Canada</country>— though for all that , I am able to state , on his own authority , he is still a Canadian citizen . Then all his books have had their original publication in the<country>United States</country>, and while a few of them have subsequently carried the imprints of Canadian publishers , none of these can be said ever to have made any special effort to push their sale . Another reason for the fact above mentioned is that Mr. Carman has always scorned to advertise himself , while his work has never been the subject of the log-rolling and booming which the work of many another poet has had — to his ultimate loss . A further reason is that he follows a rule of his own in preparing his books for publication . Most poets publish a volume of their work as soon as , through their industry and perseverance , they have material enough on hand to make publication desirable in their eyes . Not so with Mr. Carman , however , his rule being not to publish until he has done sufficient work of a certain general character or key to make a volume . As a result , you cannot fully know or estimate his work by one book , or two books , or even half a dozen ; you must possess or be familiar with every one of the score and more volumes which contain his output of poetry before you can realise how great and how many-sided is his genius .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>It is a common remark on the part of those who respond readily to the vigorous work of Kipling , or Masefield , even our own Service , that Bliss Carman 's poetry has no relation to or concern with ordinary , everyday life . One would suppose that most persons who cared for poetry at all turned to it as a relief from or counter to the burdens and vexations of the daily round ; but in any event , the remark referred to seems to me to indicate either the most casual acquaintance with Mr. Carman 's work , or a complete misunderstanding and misapprehension of the meaning of it . I grant that you will find little or nothing in it all to remind you of the grim realities and vexing social problems of this modern existence of ours ; but to say or to suggest that these things do not exist for Mr. Carman is to say or to suggest something which is the reverse of true . The truth is , he is aware of them as only one with the sensitive organism of a poet can be ; but he does not feel that he has a call or mission to remedy them , and still less to sing of them . He therefore leaves the immediate problems of the day to those who choose , or are led , to occupy themselves therewith , and turns resolutely away to dwell upon those things which for him possess infinitely greater importance .</titlePart></docTitle>

  <body>
   <p>“ What are they ? ” one who knows Mr. Carman only as , say , a lyrist of spring or as a singer of the delights of vagabondia probably will ask in some wonder . Well , the things which concern him above all , I would answer , are first , and naturally , the beauty and wonder of this world of ours , and next the mystery of the earthly pilgrimage of the human soul out of eternity and back into it again .</p>
   <p>The poems in the present volume — which , by the way , can boast the high honor of being the very first regular Canadian edition of his work — will be evidence ample and conclusive to every reader , I am sure , of the place which</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The perennial enchanted</l>
     <l n="2">Lovely world and all its lore</l>
   </lg>
   <p>occupy in the heart and soul of Bliss Carman , as well as of the magical power with which he is able to convey the deep and unfailing satisfaction and delight which they possess for him . They , however , represent his latest period ( he has had three well-defined periods ) , comprising selections from three of his last published volumes : The Rough Rider , Echoes from Vagabondia , and April Airs , together with a number of new poems , and do not show , except here and there and by hints and flashes , how great is his preoccupation with the problem of man 's existence —</p>
   <p>the hidden import Of man 's eternal plight .</p>
   <p>This is manifest most in certain of his earlier books , for in these he turns and returns to the greatest of all the problems of man almost constantly , probing , with consummate and almost unrivalled use of the art of expression , for the secret which surely , he clearly feels , lies hidden somewhere , to be discovered if one could but pierce deeply enough . Pick up Behind the Arras , and as you turn over page after page you cannot but observe how incessantly the poet 's mind — like the minds of his two great masters , Browning and Whitman — works at this problem . In “ Behind the Arras , ” the title poem ; “ In the Wings , ” “ The Crimson House , ” “ The Lodger , ” “ Beyond the Gamut , ” “ The Juggler ” — yes , in every poem in the book — he takes up and handles the strange thing we know as , or call , life , turning it now this way , now that , in an effort to find out its meaning and purpose . He comes but little nearer success in this than do most of the rest of men , of course ; but the magical and ever-fresh beauty of his expression , the haunting melody of his lines , the variety of his images and figures and the depth and range of his thought , put his searchings and ponderings in a class by themselves .</p>
   <p>Lengthy quotation from Mr. Carman 's books is not permitted here , and I must guide myself accordingly , though with reluctance , because I believe that in a study such as this the subject should be allowed to speak for himself as much as possible . In “ Behind the Arras ” the poet describes the passage from life to death as</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A cadence dying down unto its source</l>
     <l n="2">In music 's course ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">and goes on to speak of death as</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">the broken rhythm of thought and man ,</l>
     <l n="5">The sweep and span</l>
     <l n="6">Of memory and hope</l>
     <l n="7">About the orbit where they still must grope</l>
     <l n="8">For wider scope ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="9">To be through thousand springs restored , renewed ,</l>
     <l n="10">With love imbrued ,</l>
     <l n="11">With increments of will</l>
     <l n="12">Made strong , perceiving unattainment still</l>
     <l n="13">From each new skill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">Now follow some verses from “ Behind the Gamut , ” to my mind the poet 's</l>
     <l n="15">greatest single achievement ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="16">As fine sand spread on a disc of silver ,</l>
     <l n="17">At some chord which bids the motes combine ,</l>
     <l n="18">Heeding the hidden and reverberant impulse ,</l>
     <l n="19">Shifts and dances into curve and line ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="20">The round earth , too , haply , like a dust-mote ,</l>
     <l n="21">Was set whirling her assigned sure way ,</l>
     <l n="22">Round this little orb of her ecliptic</l>
     <l n="23">To some harmony she must obey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="24">And what of man ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="25">Linked to all his half-accomplished fellows ,</l>
     <l n="26">Through unfrontiered provinces to range —</l>
     <l n="27">Man is but the morning dream of nature ,</l>
     <l n="28">Roused to some wild cadence weird and strange .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Here , now , are some verses from “ Pulvis et Umbra , ” which is to be found in Mr. Carman 's first book , Low Tide on Grand Pre , and in which the poet addresses a moth which a storm has blown into his window :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">For man walks the world with mourning</l>
     <l n="2">Down to death and leaves no trace ,</l>
     <l n="3">With the dust upon his forehead ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the shadow on his face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Pillared dust and fleeing shadow</l>
     <l n="6">As the roadside wind goes by ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the fourscore years that vanish</l>
     <l n="8">In the twinkling of an eye .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Pillared dust and fleeing shadow . ” Where in all our English literature will one find the life history of man summed up more briefly and , at the same time , more beautifully , than in that wonderful line ? Now follows a companion verse to those just quoted , taken from “ Lord of My Heart 's Elation , ” which stands in the forefront of From the Green Book of the Bards . It may be remarked here that while the poet recurs again and again to some favorite thought or idea , it is never in the same words . His expression is always new and fresh , showing how deep and true is his inspiration . Again it is man who is pictured :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A fleet and shadowy column</l>
     <l n="2">Of dust and mountain rain ,</l>
     <l n="3">To walk the earth a moment</l>
     <l n="4">And be dissolved again .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But while Mr. Carman 's speculations upon life 's meaning and the mystery of the future cannot but appeal to the thoughtful-minded , it is as an interpreter of nature that he makes his widest appeal . Bliss Carman , I must say here , and emphatically , is no mere landscape-painter ; he never , or scarcely ever , paints a picture of nature for its own sake . He goes beyond the outward aspect of things and interprets or translates for us with less keen senses as only a poet whose feeling for nature is of the deepest and profoundest , who has gone to her whole-heartedly and been taken close to her warm bosom , can do . Is this not evident from these verses from “ The Great Return ” — originally called “ The Pagan 's Prayer , ” and for some inscrutable reason to be found only in the limited Collected Poems , issued in two stately volumes in 1905 ( 1904 ) ?</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When I have lifted up my heart to thee ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thou hast ever hearkened and drawn near ,</l>
     <l n="3">And bowed thy shining face close over me ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till I could hear thee as the hill-flowers hear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">When I have cried to thee in lonely need ,</l>
     <l n="6">Being but a child of thine bereft and wrung ,</l>
     <l n="7">Then all the rivers in the hills gave heed ;</l>
     <l n="8">And the great hill-winds in thy holy tongue —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">That ancient incommunicable speech —</l>
     <l n="10">The April stars and autumn sunsets know —</l>
     <l n="11">Soothed me and calmed with solace beyond reach</l>
     <l n="12">Of human ken , mysterious and low .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Who can read or listen to those moving lines without feeling that Mr. Carman is in very truth a poet of nature — nay , Nature 's own poet ? But how could he be other when , in “ The Breath of the Reed ” ( From the Green Book of the Bards ) , he makes the appeal ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Make me thy priest , O Mother ,</l>
     <l n="2">And prophet of thy mood ,</l>
     <l n="3">With all the forest wonder</l>
     <l n="4">Enraptured and imbued .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As becomes such a poet , and particularly a poet whose birth-month is April , Mr. Carman sings much of the early spring . Again and again he takes up his woodland pipe , and lo ! Pan himself and all his train troop joyously before us . Yet the singer 's notes for all his singing never become wearied or strident ; his airs are ever new and fresh ; his latest songs are no less spontaneous and winning than were his first , written how many years ago , while at the same time they have gained in beauty and melody . What heart will not stir to the vibrant music of his immortal “ Spring Song , ” which was originally published in the first Songs from Vagabondia , and the opening verses of which follow ?</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Make me over , mother April ,</l>
     <l n="2">When the sap begins to stir !</l>
     <l n="3">When thy flowery hand delivers</l>
     <l n="4">All the mountain-prisoned rivers ,</l>
     <l n="5">And thy great heart beats and quivers</l>
     <l n="6">To revive the days that were ,</l>
     <l n="7">Make me over , mother April ,</l>
     <l n="8">When the sap begins to stir !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Take my dust and all my dreaming ,</l>
     <l n="10">Count my heart-beats one by one ,</l>
     <l n="11">Send them where the winters perish ;</l>
     <l n="12">Then some golden noon recherish</l>
     <l n="13">And restore them in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="14">Flower and scent and dust and dreaming ,</l>
     <l n="15">With their heart-beats every one !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>That poem is sufficient in itself to prove that Bliss Carman has full right and title to be called Spring 's own lyrist , though it may be remarked here that not all his spring poems are so unfeignedly joyous . Many of them indeed , have a touch , or more than a touch , of wistfulness , for the poet knows well that sorrow lurks under all joy , deep and well hidden though it may be .</p>
   <p>Mr. Carman sings equally finely , though perhaps not so frequently , of summer and the other seasons ; but as he has other claims upon our attention , I shall forbear to labor the fact , particularly as the following collection demonstrates it sufficiently . One of those other claims is as a writer of sea poetry . Few poets , it may be said , have pictured the majesty and the mystery , the beauty and the terror of the sea , better than he . His Ballads of Lost Haven is a veritable treasure-house for those whose spirits find kinship in wide expanses of moving waters . One of the best known poems in this volume is “ The Gravedigger , ” which opens thus :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh , the shambling sea is a sexton old ,</l>
     <l n="2">And well his work is done .</l>
     <l n="3">With an equal grave for lord and knave ,</l>
     <l n="4">He buries them every one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Then hoy and rip , with a rolling hip ,</l>
     <l n="6">He makes for the nearest shore ;</l>
     <l n="7">And God , who sent him a thousand ship ,</l>
     <l n="8">Will send him a thousand more ;</l>
     <l n="9">But some he 'll save for a bleaching grave ,</l>
     <l n="10">And shoulder them in to shore —</l>
     <l n="11">Shoulder them in , shoulder them in ,</l>
     <l n="12">Shoulder them in to shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">In “ The City of the Sea ” ( Last Songs from Vagabondia ) Mr. Carman</l>
     <l n="14">speaks of the seabells sounding</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="15">The eternal cadence of sea sorrow</l>
     <l n="16">For Man 's lot and immemorial wrong —</l>
     <l n="17">The lost strains that haunt the human dwelling</l>
     <l n="18">With the ghost of song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="19">Elsewhere he speaks of</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="20">The great sea , mystic and musical .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="21">And here from another poem is a striking picture :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="22">... the old sea</l>
     <l n="23">Seems to whimper and deplore</l>
     <l n="24">Mourning like a childless crone</l>
     <l n="25">With her sorrow left alone —</l>
     <l n="26">The eternal human cry</l>
     <l n="27">To the heedless passer-by .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I have said above that Mr. Carman has had three distinct periods , and intimated that the poems in the following collection are of his third period . The first period may be said to be represented by the Low Tide and Behind the Arras volumes , while the second is displayed in the three volumes of Songs from Vagabondia , which he published in association with his friend Richard Hovey . Bliss Carman was from the first too original and individual a poet to be directly influenced by anyone else ; but there can be no doubt that his friendship with Hovey helped to turn him from over-preoccupation with mysteries which , for all their greatness , are not for man to solve , to an intenser realisation of the beauty and loveliness of the world about him and of the joys of human fellowship . The result is seen in such poems as “ Spring Song , ” quoted in part above , and his perhaps equally well-known “ The Joys of the Road , ” which appeared in the same volume with that poem , and a few verses from which follow :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now the joys of the road are chiefly these :</l>
     <l n="2">A crimson touch on the hardwood trees ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">A vagrant 's morning wide and blue ,</l>
     <l n="4">In early fall , when the wind walks , too ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">A shadowy highway cool and brown ,</l>
     <l n="6">Alluring up and enticing down</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">From rippled waters and dappled swamp ,</l>
     <l n="8">From purple glory to scarlet pomp ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="9">The outward eye , the quiet will ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the striding heart from hill to hill .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Some of the finest of Mr. Carman 's work is contained in his elegiac or memorial poems , in which he commemorates Keats , Shelley , William Blake , Lincoln , Stevenson , and other men for whom he has a kindred feeling , and also friends whom he has loved and lost . Listen to these moving lines from “ Non Omnis Moriar , ” written in memory of Gleeson White , and to be found in Last Songs from Vagabondia :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There is a part of me that knows ,</l>
     <l n="2">Beneath incertitude and fear ,</l>
     <l n="3">I shall not perish when I pass</l>
     <l n="4">Beyond mortality 's frontier ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">But greatly having joyed and grieved ,</l>
     <l n="6">Greatly content , shall hear the sigh</l>
     <l n="7">Of the strange wind across the lone</l>
     <l n="8">Bright lands of taciturnity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">In patience therefore I await</l>
     <l n="10">My friend 's unchanged benign regard ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Some April when I too shall be</l>
     <l n="12">Spilt water from a broken shard .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In “ The White Gull , ” written for the centenary of the birth of Shelley in 1892 , and included in By the Aurelian Wall , he thus apostrophizes that clear and shining spirit :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O captain of the rebel host ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lead forth and far !</l>
     <l n="3">Thy toiling troopers of the night</l>
     <l n="4">Press on the unavailing fight ;</l>
     <l n="5">The sombre field is not yet lost ,</l>
     <l n="6">With thee for star .</l>

   <p>In “ A Seamark , ” a threnody for Robert Louis Stevenson , which appears in the same volume , the poet hails “ R. L. S . ” ( of whose tribe he may be said to be truly one ) as</p>
   <p>The master of the roving kind ,</p>
   <p>and goes on :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">“ Perfection 's lovers all your lives . ” Of these , it may be said without</l>
     <l n="18">qualification , is Bliss Carman himself .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>No summary of Mr. Carman 's work , however cursory , would be worthy of the name if it omitted mention of his ventures in the realm of Greek myth . From the Book of Myths is made up of work of that sort , every poem in it being full of the beauty of phrase and melody of which Mr. Carman alone has the secret . The finest poems in the book , barring the opening one , “ Overlord , ” are “ Daphne , ” “ The Dead Faun , ” “ Hylas , ” and “ At Phaedra 's Tomb , ” but I can do no more here than name them , for extracts would fail to reveal their full beauty . And beauty , after all is said , is the first and last thing with Mr. Carman . As he says himself somewhere :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The joy of the hand that hews for beauty</l>
     <l n="2">Is the dearest solace under the sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And again</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">The eternal slaves of beauty</l>
     <l n="5">Are the masters of the world .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A slave — a happy , willing slave — to beauty is the poet himself , and the world can never repay him for the message of beauty which he has brought it .</p>
   <p>Kindred to From the Book of Myths , but much more important , is Sappho : One Hundred Lyrics , one of the most successful of the numerous attempts which have been made to recapture the poems by that high priestess of song which remain to us only in fragments . Mr. Carman , as Charles G. D. Roberts points out in an introduction to the volume , has made no attempt here at translation or paraphrasing ; his venture has been “ the most perilous and most alluring in the whole field of poetry ” — that of imaginative and , at the same time , interpretive construction . Brief quotation again would fail to convey an adequate idea of the exquisiteness of the work , and all I can do , therefore , is to urge all lovers of real poetry to possess themselves of Sappho : One Hundred Lyrics , for it is literally a storehouse of lyric beauty .</p>
   <p>I must not fail here to speak of From the Book of Valentines , which contains some lovely things , notably “ At the Great Release . ” This is not only one of the finest of all Mr. Carman 's poems , but it is also one of the finest poems of our time . It is a love poem , and no one possessing any real feeling for poetry can read it without experiencing that strange thrill of the spirit which only the highest form of poetry can communicate . “ Morning and Evening , ” “ In an Iris Meadow , ” and “ A letter from Lesbos ” must be also mentioned . In the last named poem , Sappho is represented as writing to Gorgo , and expresses herself in these moving words :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">If the high gods in that triumphant time</l>
     <l n="2">Have calendared no day for thee to come</l>
     <l n="3">Light-hearted to this doorway as of old ,</l>
     <l n="4">Unmoved I shall behold their pomps go by —</l>
     <l n="5">The painted seasons in their pageantry ,</l>
     <l n="6">The silvery progressions of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="7">And all their infinite ardors unsubdued ,</l>
     <l n="8">Pass with the wind replenishing the earth</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Incredulous forever I must live</l>
     <l n="10">And , once thy lover , without joy behold ,</l>
     <l n="11">The gradual uncounted years go by ,</l>
     <l n="12">Sharing the bitterness of all things made .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Mention must be now made of Songs of the Sea Children , which can be described only as a collection of the sweetest and tenderest love lyrics written in our time —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">the lyric songs</l>
     <l n="2">The earthborn children sing ,</l>
     <l n="3">When wild-wood laughter throngs</l>
     <l n="4">The shy bird-throats of spring ;</l>
     <l n="5">When there 's not a joy of the heart</l>
     <l n="6">But flies like a flag unfurled ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the swelling buds bring back</l>
     <l n="8">The April of the world .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So perfect and complete are these lyrics that it would be almost sacrilege to quote any of them unless entire . Listen however , to these verses :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The day is lost without thee ,</l>
     <l n="2">The night has not a star .</l>
     <l n="3">Thy going is an empty room</l>
     <l n="4">Whose door is left ajar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Depart : it is the footfall</l>
     <l n="6">Of twilight on the hills .</l>
     <l n="7">Return : and every rood of ground</l>
     <l n="8">Breaks into daffodils .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There are those who will have it that Bliss Carman has been away from Canada so long that he has ceased to be , in a real sense , a Canadian . Such assume rather than know , for a very little study of his work would show them that it is shot through and through with the poet 's feeling for the land of his birth . Memories of his childhood and youthful years down by the sea are still fresh in Mr. Carman 's mind , and inspire him again and again in his writing . “ A Remembrance , ” at the beginning of the present collection , may be pointed to as a striking instance of this , but proof positive is the volume , Songs from a Northern Garden , for it could have been written only by a Canadian , born and bred , one whose heart and soul thrill to the thought of Canada . I would single out from this volume for special mention as being “ Canadian ” in the fullest sense “ In a Grand Pre Garden , ” “ The Keeper 's Silence , ” “ At Home and Abroad , ” “ Killoleet , ” and “ Above the Gaspereau , ” but have no space to quote from them .</p>
   <p>But Mr. Carman is not only a Canadian , he is also a Briton ; and evidence of this is his Ode on the Coronation , written on the occasion of the crowning of King Edward VII in 1902 . This poem — the very existence of which is hardly known among us — ought to be put in the hands of every child and youth who speaks the English tongue , for no other , I dare maintain — nothing by Kipling , or Newbolt , or any other of our so-called “ Imperial singers ” — expresses more truly and more movingly the deep feeling of love and reverence which the very thought of England evokes in every son of hers , even though it may never have been his to see her white cliffs rise or to tread her storied ground :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">O England , little mother by the sleepless Northern tide ,</l>
     <l n="2">Having bred so many nations to devotion , trust , and pride ,</l>
     <l n="3">Very tenderly we turn</l>
     <l n="4">With welling hearts that yearn</l>
     <l n="5">Still to love you and defend you ,— let the sons of men discern</l>
     <l n="6">Wherein your right and title , might and majesty , reside .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In concluding this , I greatly fear , lamentably inadequate study , I come to the collection which follows , and which , as intimated above , represents the work of Mr. Carman 's latest period . I must say at once that , while I yield to no one in admiration for Low Tide and the other books of that period , or for the work of the second period , as represented by the Songs from Vagabondia volumes , I have no hesitation in declaring that I regard the poet 's work of the past few years with even higher admiration . It may not possess the force and vigor of the work which preceded it ; but anything seemingly missing in that respect is more than made up for me by increased beauty and clarity of expression . The mysticism — verging , or more than verging , at times on symbolism — which marked his earlier poems , and which hung , as it were , as a veil between them and the reader , has gone , and the poet 's thought or theme now lies clearly before us as in a mirror . What — to take a verse from the following pages at random — could be more pellucid , more crystal clear in expression — what indeed , could come closer to that achieving of the impossible at which every real poet must aim — than this from “ In Gold Lacquer ” ( page 12 ) ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Gold are the great trees overhead ,</l>
     <l n="2">And gold the leaf-strewn grass ,</l>
     <l n="3">As though a cloth of gold were spread</l>
     <l n="4">To let a seraph pass .</l>
     <l n="5">And where the pageant should go by ,</l>
     <l n="6">Meadow and wood and stream ,</l>
     <l n="7">The world is all of lacquered gold ,</l>
     <l n="8">Expectant as a dream .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poet , happily , has fully recovered from the serious illness which laid him low some two years ago , and which for a time caused his friends and admirers the gravest concern , and so we may look forward hopefully to seeing further volumes of verse come from the press to make certain his name and fame . But if , for any reason , this should not be — which the gods forfend !— Later Poems , I dare affirm , must and will be regarded as the fine flower and crowning achievement of the genius and art of Bliss Carman .</p>

      <l n="900">Easter Eve</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>If I should tell you I saw Pan lately down by the shallows of Silvermine , Blowing an air on his pipe of willow , just as the moon began to shine ; Or say that , coming from town on Wednesday , I met Christ walking in Ponus Street ; You might remark , “ Our friend is flighty ! Visions , for want of enough red meat ! ”</p>
   <p>Then let me ask you . Last December , when there was skating on Wampanaw , Among the weeds and sticks and grasses under the hard black ice I saw An old mud-turtle poking about , as if he were putting his house to rights , Stiff with the cold perhaps , yet knowing enough to prepare for the winter nights .</p>
   <p>And here he is on a log this morning , sunning himself as calm as you please . But I want to know , when the lock of winter was sprung of a sudden , who kept the keys ? Who told old nibbler to go to sleep safe and sound with the lily roots , And then in the first warm days of April — out to the sun with the greening shoots ?</p>
   <p>By night a flock of geese went over , honking north on the trails of air , The spring express — but who despatched it , equipped with speed and cunning care ? Hark to our bluebird down in the orchard trolling his chant of the happy heart , As full of light as a theme of Mozart 's — but where did he learn that more than art ?</p>
   <p>Where the river winds through grassy meadows , as sure as the south wind brings the rain , Sounding his reedy note in the alders , the redwing comes back to his nest again . Are these not miracles ? Prompt you answer : “ Merely the prose of natural fact ; Nothing but instinct plain and patent , born in the creatures , that bids them act . ”</p>
   <p>Well , I have an instinct as fine and valid , surely , as that of the beasts and birds , Concerning death and the life immortal , too deep for logic , too vague for words . No trace of beauty can pass or perish , but other beauty is somewhere born ; No seed of truth or good be planted , but the yield must grow as the growing corn .</p>
   <p>Therefore this ardent mind and spirit I give to the glowing days of earth . To be wrought by the Lord of life to something of lasting import and lovely worth . If the toil I give be without self-seeking , bestowed to the limit of will and power , To fashion after some form ideal the instant task and the waiting hour ,</p>
   <p>It matters not though defeat undo me , though faults betray me and sorrows scar , Already I share the life eternal with the April buds and the evening star . The slim new moon is my sister now ; the rain , my brother ; the wind , my friend . Is it not well with these forever ? Can the soul of man fare ill in the end ?</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Down from the line of the shore 's deep shadows another and softer picture lies , As if the soul of the lake in slumber should harbor a dream of paradise ,— Passive and blurred and unsubstantial , lulling the sense and luring the mind With the spell of an empty fairy world , where sinew and sap are left behind .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">So men dream of a far-off heaven of power and knowledge and</l>
     <l n="2">endless joy ,</l>
     <l n="3">Asleep to the moment 's fine elation , dull to the day 's divine</l>
     <l n="4">employ ,</l>
     <l n="5">Musing over a phantom image , born of fantastic hope and fear ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of the very happiness life engenders and earth provides — our</l>
     <l n="7">privilege here .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dare we dispel a single transport , neglect the worth that is here and now , Yet dream of enjoying its shadowy semblance in the by-and-by somewhere , somehow ? I heard the wind on the hillside whisper , “ They ill prepare for a journey hence Who waste the senses and starve the spirit in a world all made for spirit and sense .</p>
   <p>“ Is the full stream fed from a stifled source , or the ripe fruit filled from a blighted flower ? Are not the brook and the blossom greatened through many a busy beatified hour ? Not in the shadow but in the substance , plastic and potent at our command , Are all the wisdom and gladness of heart ; this is the kingdom of heaven at hand . ”</p>
   <p>So I will pass through the lovely world , and partake of beauty to feed my soul . With earth my domain and growth my portion , how should I sue for a further dole ? In the lift I feel of immortal rapture , in the flying glimpse I gain of truth , Released is the passion that sought perfection , assuaged the ardor of dreamful youth .</p>
   <p>The patience of time shall teach me courage , the strength of the sun shall lend me poise . I would give thanks for the autumn glory , for the teaching of earth and all her joys . Her fine fruition shall well suffice me ; the air shall stir in my veins like wine ; While the moment waits and the wonder deepens , my life shall merge with the life divine .</p>
