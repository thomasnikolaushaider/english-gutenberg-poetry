      <l n="751">The lesson we suffer the most in learning :</l>
      <l n="752">That a happy man is a man forgetful</l>
      <l n="753">Of all the torturing ills around him .</l>
      <l n="754">When or where I first met the woman</l>
      <l n="755">I cherished and made my wife , no matter .</l>
      <l n="756">Enough to say that I found her and kept her</l>
      <l n="757">Here in my heart with as pure a devotion</l>
      <l n="758">As ever Christ felt for his brothers . Forgive me</l>
      <l n="759">For naming His name in your patient presence ;</l>
      <l n="760">But I feel my words , and the truth I utter</l>
      <l n="761">Is God 's own truth . I loved that woman , —</l>
      <l n="762">Not for her face , but for something fairer ,</l>
      <l n="763">Something diviner , I thought , than beauty :</l>
      <l n="764">I loved the spirit — the human something</l>
      <l n="765">That seemed to chime with my own condition ,</l>
      <l n="766">And make soul-music when we were together ;</l>
      <l n="767">And we were never apart , from the moment</l>
      <l n="768">My eyes flashed into her eyes the message</l>
      <l n="769">That swept itself in a quivering answer</l>
      <l n="770">Back through my strange lost being . My pulses</l>
      <l n="771">Leapt with an aching speed ; and the measure</l>
      <l n="772">Of this great world grew small and smaller ,</l>
      <l n="773">Till it seemed the sky and the land and the ocean</l>
      <l n="774">Closed at last in a mist all golden</l>
      <l n="775">Around us two . And we stood for a season</l>
      <l n="776">Like gods outflung from chaos , dreaming</l>
      <l n="777">That we were the king and the queen of the fire</l>
      <l n="778">That reddened the clouds of love that held us</l>
      <l n="779">Blind to the new world soon to be ours —</l>
      <l n="780">Ours to seize and sway . The passion</l>
      <l n="781">Of that great love was a nameless passion ,</l>
      <l n="782">Bright as the blaze of the sun at noonday ,</l>
      <l n="783">Wild as the flames of hell ; but , mark you ,</l>
      <l n="784">Never a whit less pure for its fervor .</l>
      <l n="785">The baseness in me ( for I was human )</l>
      <l n="786">Burned like a worm , and perished ; and nothing</l>
      <l n="787">Was left me then but a soul that mingled</l>
      <l n="788">Itself with hers , and swayed and shuddered</l>
      <l n="789">In fearful triumph . When I consider</l>
      <l n="790">That helpless love and the cursed folly</l>
      <l n="791">That wrecked my life for the sake of a woman</l>
      <l n="792">Who broke with a laugh the chains of her marriage</l>
      <l n="793">( Whatever the word may mean ) , I wonder</l>
      <l n="794">If all the woe was her sin , or whether</l>
      <l n="795">The chains themselves were enough to lead her</l>
      <l n="796">In love 's despite to break them . . . . Sinners</l>
      <l n="797">And saints — I say — are rocked in the cradle ,</l>
      <l n="798">But never are known till the will within them</l>
      <l n="799">Speaks in its own good time . So I foster</l>
      <l n="800">Even to-night for the woman who wronged me ,</l>
      <l n="801">Nothing of hate , nor of love , but a feeling</l>
      <l n="802">Of still regret ; for the man — But hear me ,</l>
      <l n="803">And judge for yourself : —</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="147">
      <l n="804">For a time the seasons</l>
      <l n="805">Changed and passed in a sweet succession</l>
      <l n="806">That seemed to me like an endless music :</l>
      <l n="807">Life was a rolling psalm , and the choirs</l>
      <l n="808">Of God were glad for our love . I fancied</l>
      <l n="809">All this , and more than I dare to tell you</l>
      <l n="810">To-night , — yes , more than I dare to remember ;</l>
      <l n="811">And then — well , the music stopped . There are moments</l>
      <l n="812">In all men 's lives when it stops , I fancy , —</l>
      <l n="813">Or seems to stop , — till it comes to cheer them</l>
      <l n="814">Again with a larger sound . The curtain</l>
      <l n="815">Of life just then is lifted a little</l>
      <l n="816">To give to their sight new joys — new sorrows —</l>
      <l n="817">Or nothing at all , sometimes . I was watching</l>
      <l n="818">The slow , sweet scenes of a golden picture ,</l>
      <l n="819">Flushed and alive with a long delusion</l>
      <l n="820">That made the murmur of home , when I shuddered</l>
      <l n="821">And felt like a knife that awful silence</l>
      <l n="822">That comes when the music goes — forever .</l>
      <l n="823">The truth came over my life like a darkness</l>
      <l n="824">Over a forest where one man wanders ,</l>
      <l n="825">Worse than alone . For a time I staggered</l>
      <l n="826">And stumbled on with a weak persistence</l>
      <l n="827">After the phantom of hope that darted</l>
      <l n="828">And dodged like a frightened thing before me ,</l>
      <l n="829">To quit me at last , and vanish . Nothing</l>
      <l n="830">Was left me then but the curse of living</l>
      <l n="831">And bearing through all my days the fever</l>
      <l n="832">And thirst of a poisoned love . Were I stronger ,</l>
      <l n="833">Or weaker , perhaps my scorn had saved me ,</l>
      <l n="834">Given me strength to crush my sorrow</l>
      <l n="835">With hate for her and the world that praised her —</l>
      <l n="836">To have left her , then and there — to have conquered</l>
      <l n="837">That old false life with a new and a wiser , —</l>
      <l n="838">Such things are easy in words . You listen ,</l>
      <l n="839">And frown , I suppose , that I never mention</l>
      <l n="840">That beautiful word , FORGIVE ! — I forgave her</l>
      <l n="841">First of all ; and I praised kind Heaven</l>
      <l n="842">That I was a brave , clean man to do it ;</l>
      <l n="843">And then I tried to forget . Forgiveness !</l>
      <l n="844">What does it mean when the one forgiven</l>
      <l n="845">Shivers and weeps and clings and kisses</l>
      <l n="846">The credulous fool that holds her , and tells him</l>
      <l n="847">A thousand things of a good man 's mercy ,</l>
      <l n="848">And then slips off with a laugh and plunges</l>
      <l n="849">Back to the sin she has quit for a season ,</l>
      <l n="850">To tell him that hell and the world are better</l>
      <l n="851">For her than a prophet 's heaven ? Believe me ,</l>
      <l n="852">The love that dies ere its flames are wasted</l>
      <l n="853">In search of an alien soul is better ,</l>
      <l n="854">Better by far than the lonely passion</l>
      <l n="855">That burns back into the heart that feeds it .</l>
      <l n="856">For I loved her still , and the more she mocked me , —</l>
      <l n="857">Fooled with her endless pleading promise</l>
      <l n="858">Of future faith , — the more I believed her</l>
      <l n="859">The penitent thing she seemed ; and the stronger</l>
      <l n="860">Her choking arms and her small hot kisses</l>
      <l n="861">Bound me and burned my brain to pity ,</l>
      <l n="862">The more she grew to the heavenly creature</l>
      <l n="863">That brightened the life I had lost forever .</l>
      <l n="864">The truth was gone somehow for the moment ;</l>
      <l n="865">The curtain fell for a time ; and I fancied</l>
      <l n="866">We were again like gods together ,</l>
      <l n="867">Loving again with the old glad rapture .</l>
      <l n="868">But scenes like these , too often repeated ,</l>
      <l n="869">Failed at last , and her guile was wasted .</l>
      <l n="870">I made an end of her shrewd caresses</l>
      <l n="871">And told her a few straight words . She took them</l>
      <l n="872">Full at their worth — and the farce was over .</l>
      <l n="873">. . . . .</l>
      <l n="874">At first my dreams of the past upheld me ,</l>
      <l n="875">But they were a short support : the present</l>
      <l n="876">Pushed them away , and I fell . The mission</l>
      <l n="877">Of life ( whatever it was ) was blasted ;</l>
      <l n="878">My game was lost . And I met the winner</l>
      <l n="879">Of that foul deal as a sick slave gathers</l>
      <l n="880">His painful strength at the sight of his master ;</l>
      <l n="881">And when he was past I cursed him , fearful</l>
      <l n="882">Of that strange chance which makes us mighty</l>
      <l n="883">Or mean , or both . I cursed him and hated</l>
      <l n="884">The stones he pressed with his heel ; I followed</l>
      <l n="885">His easy march with a backward envy ,</l>
      <l n="886">And cursed myself for the beast within me .</l>
      <l n="887">But pride is the master of love , and the vision</l>
      <l n="888">Of those old days grew faint and fainter :</l>
      <l n="889">The counterfeit wife my mercy sheltered</l>
      <l n="890">Was nothing now but a woman , — a woman</l>
      <l n="891">Out of my way and out of my nature .</l>
      <l n="892">My battle with blinded love was over ,</l>
      <l n="893">My battle with aching pride beginning .</l>
      <l n="894">If I was the loser at first , I wonder</l>
      <l n="895">If I am the winner now ! . . . I doubt it .</l>
      <l n="896">My life is a losing game ; and to-morrow —</l>
      <l n="897">To-morrow ! — Christ ! did I say to-morrow ? . . .</l>
      <l n="898">Is your brandy good for death ? . . . There , — listen : —</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="148">
      <l n="899">When love goes out , and a man is driven</l>
      <l n="900">To shun mankind for the scars that make him</l>
      <l n="901">A joke for all chattering tongues , he carries</l>
      <l n="902">A double burden . The woes I suffered</l>
      <l n="903">After that hard betrayal made me</l>
      <l n="904">Pity , at first , all breathing creatures</l>
      <l n="905">On this bewildered earth . I studied</l>
      <l n="906">Their faces and made for myself the story</l>
      <l n="907">Of all their scattered lives . Like brothers</l>
      <l n="908">And sisters they seemed to me then ; and I nourished</l>
      <l n="909">A stranger friendship wrought in my fancy</l>
      <l n="910">Between those people and me . But somehow ,</l>
      <l n="911">As time went on , there came queer glances</l>
      <l n="912">Out of their eyes , and the shame that stung me</l>
      <l n="913">Harassed my pride with a crazed impression</l>
      <l n="914">That every face in the surging city</l>
      <l n="915">Was turned to me ; and I saw sly whispers ,</l>
      <l n="916">Now and then , as I walked and wearied</l>
      <l n="917">My wasted life twice over in bearing</l>
      <l n="918">With all my sorrow the sorrows of others , —</l>
      <l n="919">Till I found myself their fool . Then I trembled , —</l>
      <l n="920">A poor scared thing , — and their prying faces</l>
      <l n="921">Told me the ghastly truth : they were laughing</l>
      <l n="922">At me and my fate . My God , I could feel it —</l>
      <l n="923">That laughter ! And then the children caught it ;</l>
      <l n="924">And I , like a struck dog , crept and listened .</l>
      <l n="925">And then when I met the man who had weakened</l>
      <l n="926">A woman 's love to his own desire ,</l>
      <l n="927">It seemed to me that all hell were laughing</l>
      <l n="928">In fiendish concert ! I was their victim —</l>
      <l n="929">And his , and hate 's . And there was the struggle !</l>
      <l n="930">As long as the earth we tread holds something</l>
      <l n="931">A tortured heart can love , the meaning</l>
      <l n="932">Of life is not wholly blurred ; but after</l>
      <l n="933">The last loved thing in the world has left us ,</l>
      <l n="934">We know the triumph of hate . The glory</l>
      <l n="935">Of good goes out forever ; the beacon</l>
      <l n="936">Of sin is the light that leads us downward —</l>
      <l n="937">Down to the fiery end . The road runs</l>
      <l n="938">Right through hell ; and the souls that follow</l>
      <l n="939">The cursed ways where its windings lead them</l>
      <l n="940">Suffer enough , I say , to merit</l>
      <l n="941">All grace that a God can give . — The fashion</l>
      <l n="942">Of our belief is to lift all beings</l>
      <l n="943">Born for a life that knows no struggle</l>
      <l n="944">In sin 's tight snares to eternal glory —</l>
      <l n="945">All apart from the branded millions</l>
      <l n="946">Who carry through life their faces graven</l>
      <l n="947">With sure brute scars that tell the story</l>
      <l n="948">Of their foul , fated passions . Science</l>
      <l n="949">Has yet no salve to smooth or soften</l>
      <l n="950">The cradle-scars of a tyrant 's visage ;</l>
      <l n="951">No drug to purge from the vital essence</l>
      <l n="952">Of souls the sleeping venom . Virtue</l>
      <l n="953">May flower in hell , when its roots are twisted</l>
      <l n="954">And wound with the roots of vice ; but the stronger</l>
      <l n="955">Never is known till there comes that battle</l>
      <l n="956">With sin to prove the victor . Perilous</l>
      <l n="957">Things are these demons we call our passions :</l>
      <l n="958">Slaves are we of their roving fancies ,</l>
      <l n="959">Fools of their devilish glee . — You think me ,</l>
      <l n="960">I know , in this maundering way designing</l>
      <l n="961">To lighten the load of my guilt and cast it</l>
      <l n="962">Half on the shoulders of God . But hear me !</l>
      <l n="963">I 'm partly a man , — for all my weakness , —</l>
      <l n="964">If weakness it were to stand and murder</l>
      <l n="965">Before men 's eyes the man who had murdered</l>
      <l n="966">Me , and driven my burning forehead</l>
      <l n="967">With horns for the world to laugh at . Trust me !</l>
      <l n="968">And try to believe my words but a portion</l>
      <l n="969">Of what God 's purpose made me ! The coward</l>
      <l n="970">Within me cries for this ; and I beg you</l>
      <l n="971">Now , as I come to the end , to remember</l>
      <l n="972">That women and men are on earth to travel</l>
      <l n="973">All on a different road . Hereafter</l>
      <l n="974">The roads may meet . . . . I trust in something —</l>
      <l n="975">I know not what . . . .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="149">
      <l n="976">Well , this was the way of it : —</l>
      <l n="977">Stung with the shame and the secret fury</l>
      <l n="978">That comes to the man who has thrown his pittance</l>
      <l n="979">Of self at a traitor 's feet , I wandered</l>
      <l n="980">Weeks and weeks in a baffled frenzy ,</l>
      <l n="981">Till at last the devil spoke . I heard him ,</l>
      <l n="982">And laughed at the love that strove to touch me , —</l>
      <l n="983">The dead , lost love ; and I gripped the demon</l>
      <l n="984">Close to my breast , and held him , praising</l>
      <l n="985">The fates and the furies that gave me the courage</l>
      <l n="986">To follow his wild command . Forgetful</l>
      <l n="987">Of all to come when the work was over , —</l>
      <l n="988">There came to me then no stony vision</l>
      <l n="989">Of these three hundred days , — I cherished</l>
      <l n="990">An awful joy in my brain . I pondered</l>
      <l n="991">And weighed the thing in my mind , and gloried</l>
      <l n="992">In life to think that I was to conquer</l>
      <l n="993">Death at his own dark door , — and chuckled</l>
      <l n="994">To think of it done so cleanly . One evening</l>
      <l n="995">I knew that my time had come . I shuddered</l>
      <l n="996">A little , but rather for doubt than terror ,</l>
      <l n="997">And followed him , — led by the nameless devil</l>
      <l n="998">I worshipped and called my brother . The city</l>
      <l n="999">Shone like a dream that night ; the windows</l>
      <l n="1000">Flashed with a piercing flame , and the pavements</l>
      <l n="1001">Pulsed and swayed with a warmth — or something</l>
      <l n="1002">That seemed so then to my feet — and thrilled me</l>
      <l n="1003">With a quick , dizzy joy ; and the women</l>
      <l n="1004">And men , like marvellous things of magic ,</l>
      <l n="1005">Floated and laughed and sang by my shoulder ,</l>
      <l n="1006">Sent with a wizard motion . Through it</l>
      <l n="1007">And over and under it all there sounded</l>
      <l n="1008">A murmur of life , like bees ; and I listened</l>
      <l n="1009">And laughed again to think of the flower</l>
      <l n="1010">That grew , blood-red , for me ! . . . This fellow</l>
      <l n="1011">Was one of the popular sort who flourish</l>
      <l n="1012">Unruffled where gods would fall . For a conscience</l>
      <l n="1013">He carried a snug deceit that made him</l>
      <l n="1014">The man of the time and the place , whatever</l>
      <l n="1015">The time or the place might be . Were he sounding ,</l>
      <l n="1016">With a genial craft that cloaked its purpose ,</l>
      <l n="1017">Nigh to itself , the depth of a woman</l>
      <l n="1018">Fooled with his brainless art , or sending</l>
      <l n="1019">The midnight home with songs and bottles , —</l>
      <l n="1020">The cad was there , and his ease forever</l>
      <l n="1021">Shone with the smooth and slippery polish</l>
      <l n="1022">That tells the snake . That night he drifted</l>
      <l n="1023">Into an up-town haunt and ordered —</l>
      <l n="1024">Whatever it was — with a soft assurance</l>
      <l n="1025">That made me mad as I stood behind him ,</l>
      <l n="1026">Gripping his death , and waited . Coward ,</l>
      <l n="1027">I think , is the name the world has given</l>
      <l n="1028">To men like me ; but I 'll swear I never</l>
      <l n="1029">Thought of my own disgrace when I shot him —</l>
      <l n="1030">Yes , in the back , — I know it , I know it</l>
      <l n="1031">Now ; but what if I do ? . . . As I watched him</l>
      <l n="1032">Lying there dead in the scattered sawdust ,</l>
      <l n="1033">Wet with a day 's blown froth , I noted</l>
      <l n="1034">That things were still ; that the walnut tables ,</l>
      <l n="1035">Where men but a moment before were sitting ,</l>
      <l n="1036">Were gone ; that a screen of something around me</l>
      <l n="1037">Shut them out of my sight . But the gilded</l>
