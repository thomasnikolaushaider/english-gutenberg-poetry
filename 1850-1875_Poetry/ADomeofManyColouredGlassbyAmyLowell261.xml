   <p>LYRICAL POEMS</p>
   <p>Before the Altar</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Before the Altar , bowed , he stands</l>
     <l n="2">With empty hands ;</l>
     <l n="3">Upon it perfumed offerings burn</l>
     <l n="4">Wreathing with smoke the sacrificial urn .</l>
     <l n="5">Not one of all these has he given ,</l>
     <l n="6">No flame of his has leapt to Heaven</l>
     <l n="7">Firesouled , vermilion-hearted ,</l>
     <l n="8">Forked , and darted ,</l>
     <l n="9">Consuming what a few spare pence</l>
     <l n="10">Have cheaply bought , to fling from hence</l>
     <l n="11">In idly-asked petition .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">His sole condition</l>
     <l n="13">Love and poverty .</l>
     <l n="14">And while the moon</l>
     <l n="15">Swings slow across the sky ,</l>
     <l n="16">Athwart a waving pine tree ,</l>
     <l n="17">And soon</l>
     <l n="18">Tips all the needles there</l>
     <l n="19">With silver sparkles , bitterly</l>
     <l n="20">He gazes , while his soul</l>
     <l n="21">Grows hard with thinking of the poorness of his dole .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="22">“ Shining and distant Goddess , hear my prayer</l>
     <l n="23">Where you swim in the high air !</l>
     <l n="24">With charity look down on me ,</l>
     <l n="25">Under this tree ,</l>
     <l n="26">Tending the gifts I have not brought ,</l>
     <l n="27">The rare and goodly things</l>
     <l n="28">I have not sought .</l>
     <l n="29">Instead , take from me all my life !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="30">“ Upon the wings</l>
     <l n="31">Of shimmering moonbeams</l>
     <l n="32">I pack my poet 's dreams</l>
     <l n="33">For you .</l>
     <l n="34">My wearying strife ,</l>
     <l n="35">My courage , my loss ,</l>
     <l n="36">Into the night I toss</l>
     <l n="37">For you .</l>
     <l n="38">Golden Divinity ,</l>
     <l n="39">Deign to look down on me</l>
     <l n="40">Who so unworthily</l>
     <l n="41">Offers to you :</l>
     <l n="42">All life has known ,</l>
     <l n="43">Seeds withered unsown ,</l>
     <l n="44">Hopes turning quick to fears ,</l>
     <l n="45">Laughter which dies in tears .</l>
     <l n="46">The shredded remnant of a man</l>
     <l n="47">Is all the span</l>
     <l n="48">And compass of my offering to you .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="49">“ Empty and silent , I</l>
     <l n="50">Kneel before your pure , calm majesty .</l>
     <l n="51">On this stone , in this urn</l>
     <l n="52">I pour my heart and watch it burn ,</l>
     <l n="53">Myself the sacrifice ; but be</l>
     <l n="54">Still unmoved : Divinity . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="58">Wild little bird , who chose thee for a sign</l>
     <l n="59">To put upon the cover of this book ?</l>
     <l n="60">Who heard thee singing in the distance dim ,</l>
     <l n="61">The vague , far greenness of the enshrouding wood ,</l>
     <l n="62">When the damp freshness of the morning earth</l>
     <l n="63">Was full of pungent sweetness and thy song ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="64">Who followed over moss and twisted roots ,</l>
     <l n="65">And pushed through the wet leaves of trailing vines</l>
     <l n="66">Where slanting sunbeams gleamed uncertainly ,</l>
     <l n="67">While ever clearer came the dropping notes ,</l>
     <l n="68">Until , at last , two widening trunks disclosed</l>
     <l n="69">Thee singing on a spray of branching beech ,</l>
     <l n="70">Hidden , then seen ; and always that same song</l>
     <l n="71">Of joyful sweetness , rapture incarnate ,</l>
     <l n="72">Filled the hushed , rustling stillness of the wood ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">We do not know what bird thou art . Perhaps</l>
     <l n="74">That fairy bird , fabled in island tale ,</l>
     <l n="75">Who never sings but once , and then his song</l>
     <l n="76">Is of such fearful beauty that he dies</l>
     <l n="77">From sheer exuberance of melody .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="78">For this they took thee , little bird , for this</l>
     <l n="79">They captured thee , tilting among the leaves ,</l>
     <l n="80">And stamped thee for a symbol on this book .</l>
     <l n="81">For it contains a song surpassing thine ,</l>
     <l n="82">Richer , more sweet , more poignant . And the poet</l>
     <l n="83">Who felt this burning beauty , and whose heart</l>
     <l n="84">Was full of loveliest things , sang all he knew</l>
     <l n="85">A little while , and then he died ; too frail</l>
     <l n="86">To bear this untamed , passionate burst of song .</l>

     <l n="98">Pushing forward just for these ;</l>
     <l n="99">Dew-besprinkled , bramble-marred ,</l>
     <l n="100">Poor duped mortal , travel-scarred ,</l>
     <l n="101">Always thinking soon to seize</l>

     <l n="197">High up above the open , welcoming door</l>
     <l n="198">It hangs , a piece of wood with colours dim .</l>
     <l n="199">Once , long ago , it was a waving tree</l>
     <l n="200">And knew the sun and shadow through the leaves</l>
     <l n="201">Of forest trees , in a thick eastern wood .</l>
     <l n="202">The winter snows had bent its branches down ,</l>
     <l n="203">The spring had swelled its buds with coming flowers ,</l>
     <l n="204">Summer had run like fire through its veins ,</l>
     <l n="205">While autumn pelted it with chestnut burrs ,</l>
     <l n="206">And strewed the leafy ground with acorn cups .</l>
     <l n="207">Dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among</l>
     <l n="208">Its branches , breaking here and there a limb ;</l>
     <l n="209">But every now and then broad sunlit days</l>
     <l n="210">Lovingly lingered , caught among the leaves .</l>
     <l n="211">Yes , it had known all this , and yet to us</l>
     <l n="212">It does not speak of mossy forest ways ,</l>
     <l n="213">Of whispering pine trees or the shimmering birch ;</l>
     <l n="214">But of quick winds , and the salt , stinging sea !</l>
     <l n="215">An artist once , with patient , careful knife ,</l>
     <l n="216">Had fashioned it like to the untamed sea .</l>
     <l n="217">Here waves uprear themselves , their tops blown back</l>
     <l n="218">By the gay , sunny wind , which whips the blue</l>
     <l n="219">And breaks it into gleams and sparks of light .</l>
     <l n="220">Among the flashing waves are two white birds</l>
     <l n="221">Which swoop , and soar , and scream for very joy</l>
     <l n="222">At the wild sport . Now diving quickly in ,</l>
     <l n="223">Questing some glistening fish . Now flying up ,</l>
     <l n="224">Their dripping feathers shining in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="225">While the wet drops like little glints of light ,</l>
     <l n="226">Fall pattering backward to the parent sea .</l>
     <l n="227">Gliding along the green and foam-flecked hollows ,</l>
     <l n="228">Or skimming some white crest about to break ,</l>
     <l n="229">The spirits of the sky deigning to stoop</l>
     <l n="230">And play with ocean in a summer mood .</l>
     <l n="231">Hanging above the high , wide open door ,</l>
     <l n="232">It brings to us in quiet , firelit room ,</l>
     <l n="233">The freedom of the earth 's vast solitudes ,</l>
     <l n="234">Where heaping , sunny waves tumble and roll ,</l>
     <l n="235">And seabirds scream in wanton happiness .</l>

     <l n="302">All night I wrestled with a memory</l>
     <l n="303">Which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought .</l>
     <l n="304">The crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought</l>
     <l n="305">Its disillusion ; now I only cry</l>

     <l n="2">Thou dear and well-loved haunt of happy hours ,</l>
     <l n="3">How often in some distant gallery ,</l>
     <l n="4">Gained by a little painful spiral stair ,</l>
     <l n="5">Far from the halls and corridors where throng</l>
     <l n="6">The crowd of casual readers , have I passed</l>
     <l n="7">Long , peaceful hours seated on the floor</l>
     <l n="8">Of some retired nook , all lined with books ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where reverie and quiet reign supreme !</l>
     <l n="10">Above , below , on every side , high shelved</l>
     <l n="11">From careless grasp of transient interest ,</l>
     <l n="12">Stand books we can but dimly see , their charm</l>
     <l n="13">Much greater that their titles are unread ;</l>
     <l n="14">While on a level with the dusty floor</l>
     <l n="15">Others are ranged in orderly confusion ,</l>
     <l n="16">And we must stoop in painful posture while</l>
     <l n="17">We read their names and learn their histories .</l>
     <l n="18">The little gallery winds round about</l>
     <l n="19">The middle of a most secluded room ,</l>
     <l n="20">Midway between the ceiling and the floor .</l>
     <l n="21">A type of those high thoughts , which while we read</l>
     <l n="22">Hover between the earth and furthest heaven</l>
     <l n="23">As fancy wills , leaving the printed page ;</l>
     <l n="24">For books but give the theme , our hearts the rest ,</l>
     <l n="25">Enriching simple words with unguessed harmony</l>
     <l n="26">And overtones of thought we only know .</l>
     <l n="27">And as we sit long hours quietly ,</l>
     <l n="28">Reading at times , and at times simply dreaming ,</l>
     <l n="29">The very room itself becomes a friend ,</l>
     <l n="30">The confidant of intimate hopes and fears ;</l>
     <l n="31">A place where are engendered pleasant thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="32">And possibilities before unguessed</l>
     <l n="33">Come to fruition born of sympathy .</l>
     <l n="34">And as in some gay garden stretched upon</l>
     <l n="35">A genial southern slope , warmed by the sun ,</l>
     <l n="36">The flowers give their fragrance joyously</l>
     <l n="37">To the caressing touch of the hot noon ;</l>
     <l n="38">So books give up the all of what they mean</l>
     <l n="39">Only in a congenial atmosphere ,</l>
     <l n="40">Only when touched by reverent hands , and read</l>
     <l n="41">By those who love and feel as well as think .</l>
     <l n="42">For books are more than books , they are the life ,</l>
     <l n="43">The very heart and core of ages past ,</l>
     <l n="44">The reason why men lived , and worked , and died ,</l>
     <l n="45">The essence and quintessence of their lives .</l>
     <l n="46">And we may know them better , and divine</l>
     <l n="47">The inner motives whence their actions sprang ,</l>
     <l n="48">Far better than the men who only knew</l>
     <l n="49">Their bodily presence , the soul forever hid</l>
     <l n="50">From those with no ability to see .</l>
     <l n="51">They wait here quietly for us to come</l>
     <l n="52">And find them out , and know them for our friends ;</l>
     <l n="53">These men who toiled and wrote only for this ,</l>
     <l n="54">To leave behind such modicum of truth</l>
     <l n="55">As each perceived and each alone could tell .</l>
     <l n="56">Silently waiting that from time to time</l>
     <l n="57">It may be given them to illuminate</l>
     <l n="58">Dull daily facts with pristine radiance</l>
     <l n="59">For some long-waited-for affinity</l>
     <l n="60">Who lingers yet in the deep womb of time .</l>
     <l n="61">The shifting sun pierces the young green leaves</l>
     <l n="62">Of elm trees , newly coming into bud ,</l>
     <l n="63">And splashes on the floor and on the books</l>
     <l n="64">Through old , high , rounded windows , dim with age .</l>
     <l n="65">The noisy city-sounds of modern life</l>
     <l n="66">Float softened to us across the old graveyard .</l>
     <l n="67">The room is filled with a warm , mellow light ,</l>
     <l n="68">No garish colours jar on our content ,</l>
     <l n="69">The books upon the shelves are old and worn .</l>
     <l n="70">‘ T was no belated effort nor attempt</l>
     <l n="71">To keep abreast with old as well as new</l>
     <l n="72">That placed them here , tricked in a modern guise ,</l>
     <l n="73">Easily got , and held in light esteem .</l>
     <l n="74">Our fathers ’ fathers , slowly and carefully</l>
     <l n="75">Gathered them , one by one , when they were new</l>
     <l n="76">And a delighted world received their thoughts</l>
     <l n="77">Hungrily ; while we but love the more ,</l>
     <l n="78">Because they are so old and grown so dear !</l>
     <l n="79">The backs of tarnished gold , the faded boards ,</l>
     <l n="80">The slightly yellowing page , the strange old type ,</l>
     <l n="81">All speak the fashion of another age ;</l>
     <l n="82">The thoughts peculiar to the man who wrote</l>
     <l n="83">Arrayed in garb peculiar to the time ;</l>
     <l n="84">As though the idiom of a man were caught</l>
     <l n="85">Imprisoned in the idiom of a race .</l>
     <l n="86">A nothing truly , yet a link that binds</l>
     <l n="87">All ages to their own inheritance ,</l>
     <l n="88">And stretching backward , dim and dimmer still ,</l>
     <l n="89">Is lost in a remote antiquity .</l>
     <l n="90">Grapes do not come of thorns nor figs of thistles ,</l>
     <l n="91">And even a great poet 's divinest thought</l>
     <l n="92">Is coloured by the world he knows and sees .</l>
     <l n="93">The little intimate things of every day ,</l>
     <l n="94">The trivial nothings that we think not of ,</l>
     <l n="95">These go to make a part of each man 's life ;</l>
     <l n="96">As much a part as do the larger thoughts</l>
     <l n="97">He takes account of . Nay , the little things</l>
     <l n="98">Of daily life it is which mold , and shape ,</l>
     <l n="99">And make him apt for noble deeds and true .</l>
     <l n="100">And as we read some much-loved masterpiece ,</l>
     <l n="101">Read it as long ago the author read ,</l>
     <l n="102">With eyes that brimmed with tears as he saw</l>
     <l n="103">The message he believed in stamped in type</l>
     <l n="104">Inviolable for the slow-coming years ;</l>
     <l n="105">We know a certain subtle sympathy ,</l>
     <l n="106">We seem to clasp his hand across the past ,</l>
     <l n="107">His words become related to the time ,</l>
     <l n="108">He is at one with his own glorious creed</l>
     <l n="109">And all that in his world was dared and done .</l>
     <l n="110">The long , still , fruitful hours slip away</l>
     <l n="111">Shedding their influences as they pass ;</l>
     <l n="112">We know ourselves the richer to have sat</l>
     <l n="113">Upon this dusty floor and dreamed our dreams .</l>
     <l n="114">No other place to us were quite the same ,</l>
     <l n="115">No other dreams so potent in their charm ,</l>
     <l n="116">For this is ours ! Every twist and turn</l>
     <l n="117">Of every narrow stair is known and loved ;</l>
     <l n="118">Each nook and cranny is our very own ;</l>
     <l n="119">The dear , old , sleepy place is full of spells</l>
     <l n="120">For us , by right of long inheritance .</l>
     <l n="121">The building simply bodies forth a thought</l>
     <l n="122">Peculiarly inherent to the race .</l>
     <l n="123">And we , descendants of that elder time ,</l>
     <l n="124">Have learnt to love the very form in which</l>
     <l n="125">The thought has been embodied to our years .</l>
     <l n="126">And here we feel that we are not alone ,</l>
     <l n="127">We too are one with our own richest past ;</l>
     <l n="128">And here that veiled , but ever smouldering fire</l>
     <l n="129">Of race , which rarely seen yet never dies ,</l>
     <l n="130">Springs up afresh and warms us with its heat .</l>
     <l n="131">And must they take away this treasure house ,</l>
     <l n="132">To us so full of thoughts and memories ;</l>
     <l n="133">To all the world beside a dismal place</l>
     <l n="134">Lacking in all this modern age requires</l>
     <l n="135">To tempt along the unfamiliar paths</l>
     <l n="136">And leafy lanes of old time literatures ?</l>
     <l n="137">It takes some time for moss and vines to grow</l>
     <l n="138">And warmly cover gaunt and chill stone walls</l>
     <l n="139">Of stately buildings from the cold North Wind .</l>
     <l n="140">The lichen of affection takes as long ,</l>
     <l n="141">Or longer , ere it lovingly enfolds</l>
     <l n="142">A place which since without it were bereft ,</l>
     <l n="143">All stript and bare , shorn of its chiefest grace .</l>
     <l n="144">For what to us were halls and corridors</l>
     <l n="145">However large and fitting , if we part</l>
     <l n="146">With this which is our birthright ; if we lose</l>
     <l n="147">A sentiment profound , unsoundable ,</l>
     <l n="148">Which Time 's slow ripening alone can make ,</l>
     <l n="149">And man 's blind foolishness so quickly mar .</l>

    <p>| Advertisements of books by the same author | ( These are taken from the back of the 1916 printing . ) A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass By AMY LOWELL New edition , cloth , $ 1. 25 PRESS NOTICES “ These poems arouse interest , and justify it by the result . Miss Lowell is the sister of President Lowell of Harvard . Her art , however , needs no reflection from such distinguished influence to make apparent its distinction . Such verse as this is delightful , has a sort of personal flavour , a loyalty to the fundamentals of life and nationality . . . . The child poems are particularly graceful . ” — ‘ Boston Evening Transcript ’ , Boston , Mass . “ Miss Lowell has given expression in exquisite form to many beautiful thoughts , inspired by a variety of subjects and based on some of the loftiest ideals . . . . “ The verses are grouped under the captions ‘ Lyrical Poems ’ , ‘ Sonnets ’ , and ‘ Verses for Children ’ . . . . “ It is difficult to say which of these are the most successful . Indeed , all reveal Miss Lowell 's powers of observation from the view-point of a lover of nature . Moreover , Miss Lowell writes with a gentle philosophy and a deep knowledge of humanity . . . . “ The sonnets are especially appealing and touch the heart strings so tenderly that there comes immediate response in the same spirit . . . . “ That she knows the workings of the juvenile mind is plainly indicated by her verses written for their reading . ” — ‘ Boston Sunday Globe ’ , Boston , Mass . “ A quite delightful little collection of verses . ” — ‘ Toronto Globe ’ , Toronto , Canada . “ The Lyrics are true to the old definition ; they would sing well to the accompaniment of the strings . We should like to hear “ Hora Stellatrix ” rendered by an artist . ” — ‘ Hartford Courant ’ , Hartford , Conn. “ Verses that show delicate appreciation of the beautiful , and imaginative quality . A sonnet entitled ‘ Dreams ’ is peculiarly full of sympathy and feeling . ” — ‘ The Sun ’ , Baltimore , Md . By the same author Sword Blades and Poppy Seed Price , $ 1. 25 Opinions of Leading Reviewers “ Against the multitudinous array of daily verse our times produce this volume utters itself with a range and brilliancy wholly remarkable . I cannot see that Miss Lowell 's use of unrhymed ‘ vers libre ’ has been surpassed in English . Read ‘ The Captured Goddess ’ , ‘ Music ’ , and ‘ The Precinct . Rochester ’ , a piece of mastercraft in this kind . A wealth of subtleties and sympathies , gorgeously wrought , full of macabre effects ( as many of the poems are ) and brilliantly worked out . The things of splendor she has made she will hardly outdo in their kind . ” — Josephine Preston Peabody , ‘ The Boston Herald ’ . “ For quaint pictorial exactitude and bizarrerie of color these poems remind one of Flemish masters and Dutch tulip gardens ; again , they are fine and fantastic , like Venetian glass ; and they are all curiously flooded with the moonlight of dreams . . . . Miss Lowell has a remarkable gift of what one might call the dramatic-decorative . Her decorative imagery is intensely dramatic , and her dramatic pictures are in themselves vivid and fantastic decorations . ” — Richard Le Gallienne , ‘ New York Times Book Review ’ . “ The book as a whole is notable for the organic relation it bears to life and to art . Miss Lowell can find authentic inspiration equally in the lapidarian stanzas of Henri de Regnier and in the color effects produced by the flicking of the tail of the great northern pike . Her work is always vivid , sincere , poetically energetic . Throughout it run , in the quaint phrase of an old poet , ‘ bright shoots of everlastingnesse ’ . ” — Ferris Greenslet , in the ‘ New Republic ’ . “ Such poems as ‘ A Lady ’ , ‘ Music ’ , ‘ White and Green ’ , are well-nigh flawless in their beauty — perfect ‘ images ’ . ” — Harriet Monroe , ‘ Poetry ’ .</p>
