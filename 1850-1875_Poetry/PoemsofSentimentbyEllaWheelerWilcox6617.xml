     <head>DOUBLE CARNATIONS</head>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">A wild Pink nestled in a garden bed ,</l>
       <l n="3">A rich Carnation flourished high above her ,</l>
       <l n="4">One day he chanced to see her pretty head</l>
       <l n="5">And leaned and looked again , and grew to love her .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">The Moss ( her humble mother ) saw with fear</l>
       <l n="7">The ardent glances of the princely stranger ;</l>
       <l n="8">With many an anxious thought and dewy tear</l>
       <l n="9">She sought to hide her darling from this danger .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">The gardener-guardian of this noble bud</l>
       <l n="11">A cruel trellis interposed between them .</l>
       <l n="12">No common Pink should mate with royal blood ,</l>
       <l n="13">He said , and sought in every way to wean them .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">The poor Pink pined and faded day by day :</l>
       <l n="15">Her restless lover from his prison bower</l>
       <l n="16">Called in a priestly bee who passed that way ,</l>
       <l n="17">And sent a message to the sorrowing flower .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">The fainting Pink wept as the bee drew near ,</l>
       <l n="19">Droning his prayers , and begged him to confess her .</l>
       <l n="20">Her weary mother , over-taxed by fear ,</l>
       <l n="21">Slept , while the priest leaned low to shrive and bless her .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">But lo ! ere long the tale went creeping out ,</l>
       <l n="23">The rich Carnation and the Pink were married !</l>
       <l n="24">The cunning bee had brought the thing about</l>
       <l n="25">While Mamma Moss in Slumber 's arms had tarried .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="26">And proud descendants of that loving pair ,</l>
       <l n="27">The offspring of that true and ardent passion ,</l>
       <l n="28">Are famous for their beauty everywhere ,</l>
       <l n="29">And leaders in the floral world of fashion .</l>

      <head>NEVER MIND</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Whatever your work and whatever its worth ,</l>
       <l n="2">No matter how strong or clever ,</l>
       <l n="3">Some one will sneer if you pause to hear ,</l>
       <l n="4">And scoff at your best endeavour .</l>
       <l n="5">For the target art has a broad expanse ,</l>
       <l n="6">And wherever you chance to hit it ,</l>
       <l n="7">Though close be your aim to the bull'shYpppHeNeye fame ,</l>
       <l n="8">There are those who will never admit it .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Though the house applauds while the artist plays ,</l>
       <l n="10">And a smiling world adores him ,</l>
       <l n="11">Somebody is there with an ennuied air</l>
       <l n="12">To say that the acting bores him .</l>
       <l n="13">For the tower of art has a lofty spire ,</l>
       <l n="14">With many a stair and landing ,</l>
       <l n="15">And those who climb seem small oft-time</l>
       <l n="16">To one at the bottom standing .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">So work along in your chosen niche</l>
       <l n="18">With a steady purpose to nerve you ;</l>
       <l n="19">Let nothing men say who pass your way</l>
       <l n="20">Relax your courage or swerve you .</l>
       <l n="21">The idle will flock by the Temple of Art</l>
       <l n="22">For just the pleasure of gazing ;</l>
       <l n="23">But climb to the top and do not stop ,</l>
       <l n="24">Though they may not all be praising .</l>

      <head>TWO WOMEN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I know two women , and one is chaste</l>
       <l n="2">And cold as the snows on a winter waste ,</l>
       <l n="3">Stainless ever in act and thought</l>
       <l n="4">( As a man , born dumb , in speech errs not ) .</l>
       <l n="5">But she has malice toward her kind ,</l>
       <l n="6">A cruel tongue and a jealous mind .</l>
       <l n="7">Void of pity and full of greed ,</l>
       <l n="8">She judges the world by her narrow creed ;</l>
       <l n="9">A brewer of quarrels , a breeder of hate ,</l>
       <l n="10">Yet she holds the key to “ Society 's ” Gate .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">The other woman , with heart of flame ,</l>
       <l n="12">Went mad for a love that marred her name :</l>
       <l n="13">And out of the grave of her murdered faith</l>
       <l n="14">She rose like a soul that has passed through death .</l>
       <l n="15">Her aims are noble , her pity so broad ,</l>
       <l n="16">It covers the world like the mercy of God .</l>
       <l n="17">A soother of discord , a healer of woes ,</l>
       <l n="18">Peace follows her footsteps wherever she goes .</l>
       <l n="19">The worthier life of the two , no doubt ,</l>
       <l n="20">And yet “ Society ” locks her out .</l>

       <l n="4">Will trample in the dust .</l>

       <l n="12">And Nature ruled by art ;</l>
       <l n="13">Though Labour toils through blinding tears</l>
       <l n="14">And idle Wealth is might ,</l>
       <l n="15">I know the honest , earnest years</l>

       <l n="20">While truth meets glances cold ,</l>
       <l n="21">I know a law complete , sublime ,</l>
       <l n="22">Controls us with its might ,</l>
