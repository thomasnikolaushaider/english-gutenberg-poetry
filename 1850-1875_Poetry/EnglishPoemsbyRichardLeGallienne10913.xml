You dream like mad , you love like tinder , you aspire like a star-struck moth — for what ? That you may hive little lyrics , and sell to a publisher for thirty pieces of silver . Hard by us here is a ‘ bee-farm . ’ It always reminds me of a publisher 's . The bee has loved a thousand flowers , through a hundred afternoons , he has filled little sacred cells with the gold of his stolen kisses — for what ? That the whole should be wrenched away and sold at so much ‘ the comb ’ — as though it were a hair-comb . ‘ Mummy is become merchandise ... and Pharaoh is sold for balsams . ’ Can we ever forget those old mornings when we rose with the lark , and , while the earliest sunlight slanted through the sleeping house , stole to the little bookclad study to read — Heaven bless us !— you , perhaps , Mary Wollstonecraft , and I , Livy , in a Froben folio of<date>1531</date>! !</docImprint>

     <l n="2">Art was a palace once , things great and fair ,</l>
     <l n="3">And strong and holy , found a temple there :</l>
     <l n="4">Now ‘ tis a lazar-house of leprous men .</l>
     <l n="5">O shall me hear an English song again !</l>
     <l n="6">Still English larks mount in the merry morn ,</l>
     <l n="7">An English May still brings an English thorn ,</l>
     <l n="8">Still English daisies up and down the grass ,</l>
     <l n="9">Still English love for English lad and lass —</l>
     <l n="10">Yet youngsters blush to sing an English song !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Thou nightingale that for six hundred years</l>
     <l n="12">Sang to the world — O art thou husht at last !</l>
     <l n="13">For , not of thee this new voice in our ears ,</l>
     <l n="14">Music of France that once was of the spheres ;</l>
     <l n="15">And not of thee these strange green flowers that spring</l>
     <l n="16">From daisy roots and seemed to bear a sting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">Thou Helicon of numbers ‘ undefiled , ’</l>
     <l n="18">Forgive that ‘ neath the shadow of thy name ,</l>
     <l n="19">England , I bring a song of little fame ;</l>
     <l n="20">Not as one worthy but as loving thee ,</l>

   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PAOLO AND FRANCESCA</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It happened in that great Italian land</l>
     <l n="2">Where every bosom heateth with a star —</l>
     <l n="3">At Rimini , anigh that crumbling strand</l>
     <l n="4">The Adriatic filcheth near and far —</l>
     <l n="5">In that same past where Dante 's dream-days are ,</l>
     <l n="6">That one Francesca gave her youthful gold</l>
     <l n="7">Unto an aged carle to bolt and bar ;</l>
     <l n="8">Though all the love which great young hearts can hold ,</l>
     <l n="9">How could she give that love unto a miser old ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Nay ! but young Paolo was the happy lad ,</l>
     <l n="11">A youth of dreaming eye yet dauntless foot ,</l>
     <l n="12">Who all Francesca 's wealth of loving had ;</l>
     <l n="13">One brave to scale a wall and steal the fruit ,</l>
     <l n="14">Nor fear because some dotard owned the root ;</l>
     <l n="15">Yea ! one who wore his love like sword on thigh</l>
     <l n="16">And kept not all his valour for his lute ;</l>
     <l n="17">One who could dare as well as sing and sigh .</l>
     <l n="18">Ah ! then were hearts to love , but they are long gone by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Ye lily-wives so happy in the nest ,</l>
     <l n="20">Whose joy within the gates of duty springs ,</l>
     <l n="21">Blame not Love 's poor , who , if they would be blest ,</l>
     <l n="22">Must steal what comes to you with marriage rings :</l>
     <l n="23">Ye pity the poor lark whose scarce-tried wings</l>
     <l n="24">Faint in the net , while still the morning air</l>
     <l n="25">With brown free throats of all his brethren sings ,</l>
     <l n="26">And can it be ye will not pity her ,</l>
     <l n="27">Whose youth is as a lark all lost to singing there ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">In opportunity of dear-bought joy</l>
     <l n="29">Rich were this twain , for old Lanciotto , he</l>
     <l n="30">Who was her lord , was brother of her boy ,</l>
     <l n="31">And in one home together dwelt the three ,</l>
     <l n="32">With brothers two beside ; and he and she</l>
     <l n="33">Sat at one board together , in one fane</l>
     <l n="34">Their voices rose upon one hymn , ah me !</l>
     <l n="35">Beneath one roof each night their limbs had lain ,</l>
     <l n="36">As now in death they share the one eternal pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">As much as common men can love a flower</l>
     <l n="38">Unto Lanciotto was Francesca dear ,</l>
     <l n="39">‘ Tis not on such Love wields his jealous power ;</l>
     <l n="40">And therefore Paolo moved him not to fear ,</l>
     <l n="41">Though he so green with youth and he so sere .</l>
     <l n="42">Nor yet indeed was wrong , the hidden thing</l>
     <l n="43">Grew at each heart , unknown of each , a year ,—</l>
     <l n="44">Two eggs still silent in the nest through spring ,</l>
     <l n="45">May draws so near to June , and not yet time to sing !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">Yet oft , indeed , through days that gave no sign</l>
     <l n="47">Had but Francesca turned about and read</l>
     <l n="48">Paolo 's bright eyes that only dared to shine</l>
     <l n="49">On the dear gold that glorified her head ;</l>
     <l n="50">Ere all the light had from their circles fled</l>
     <l n="51">And the grey Honour darkened all his face :</l>
     <l n="52">They had not come to June and nothing said ,</l>
     <l n="53">Day followed day with such an even pace ,</l>
     <l n="54">Nor night succeeded night and left no starry trace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">Or , surely , had the flower Paolo pressed</l>
     <l n="56">In some sweet volume when he put it by .</l>
     <l n="57">Told how his mistress drew it to her breast</l>
     <l n="58">And called upon his name when none was nigh ;</l>
     <l n="59">Had but the scarf he kissed with piteous cry</l>
     <l n="60">But breathed again its secret unto her ,</l>
     <l n="61">Or had but one of every little sigh</l>
     <l n="62">Each left for each been love 's true messenger :</l>
     <l n="63">They surely had not kept that winter all the year .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">Yea ! love lay hushed and waiting like a seed ,</l>
     <l n="65">Some laggard of the season still abed</l>
     <l n="66">Though the sun calls and gentle zephyrs plead ,</l>
     <l n="67">And Hope that waited long must deem it dead ;</l>
     <l n="68">Yet lo ! to-morrow sees its shining head</l>
     <l n="69">Singing at dawn ‘ mid all the garden throng :</l>
     <l n="70">Ah , had it known , it had been earlier sped —</l>
     <l n="71">Was it for fear of day it slept so long ,</l>
     <l n="72">Or were its dreams of singing sweeter than the song ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">But what poor flower can symbol all the might</l>
     <l n="74">And all the magnitude , great Love , of thee ?</l>
     <l n="75">Ah , is there aught can image thee aright</l>
     <l n="76">In earth or heaven , how great or fair it be ?</l>
     <l n="77">We watch the acorn grow into the tree ,</l>
     <l n="78">We watch the patient spark surprise the mine ,</l>
     <l n="79">But what are oaks to thy Ygdrasil-tree ?</l>
     <l n="80">What the mad mine 's convulsive strength to thine ,</l>
     <l n="81">That wrecks a world but bids heaven 's soaring steeples shine ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="82">A god that hath no earthly metaphor ,</l>
     <l n="83">A blinding word that hath no earthly rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="84">Love ! we can only call and no name more ;</l>
     <l n="85">As the great lonely thunder rolls sublime ,</l>
     <l n="86">As the great sun doth solitary climb ,</l>
     <l n="87">And we have but themselves to know them by ,</l>
     <l n="88">Just so Love stands a stranger amid Time :</l>
     <l n="89">The god is there , the great voice speaks on high ,</l>
     <l n="90">We pray , ‘ What art thou , Lord ? ’ but win us no reply .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="91">So in the dark grew Love , but feared to flower ,</l>
     <l n="92">Dreamed to himself , but never spake a word ,</l>
     <l n="93">Burned like a prisoned fire from hour to hour ,</l>
     <l n="94">Sang his dear song like an unheeded bird ;</l>
     <l n="95">Waiting the summoning voice so long unheard ,</l>
     <l n="96">Waiting with weary eyes the gracious sign</l>
     <l n="97">To bring his rose , and tell the dream he dared ,</l>
     <l n="98">The tremulous moment when the star should shine ,</l>
     <l n="99">And each should ask of each , and each should answer</l>
     <l n="100">— ‘ Thine . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="101">Winter to-day , but lo ! to-morrow spring !</l>
     <l n="102">They waited long , but oh at last it came ,</l>
     <l n="103">Came in a silver hush at evening ;</l>
     <l n="104">Francesca toyed with threads upon a frame ,</l>
     <l n="105">Hard by young Paolo read of knight and dame</l>
     <l n="106">That long ago had loved and passed away :</l>
     <l n="107">He had no other way to tell his flame ,</l>
     <l n="108">She dare not listen any other way —</l>
     <l n="109">But even that was bliss to lovers poor as they .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="110">The world grew sweet with wonder in the west</l>
     <l n="111">The while he read and while she listened there ,</l>
     <l n="112">And many a dream from out its silken nest</l>
     <l n="113">Stole like a curling incense through the air ;</l>
     <l n="114">Yet looked she not on him , nor did he dare :</l>
     <l n="115">But when the lovers kissed in Paradise</l>
     <l n="116">His voice sank and he turned his gaze on her ,</l>
     <l n="117">Like a young bird that flutters ere it flies ,—</l>
     <l n="118">And lo ! a shining angel called him from her eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="119">Then from the silence sprang a kiss like flame ,</l>
     <l n="120">And they hung lost together ; while around</l>
     <l n="121">The world was changed , no more to be the same</l>
     <l n="122">Meadow or sky , no little flower or sound</l>
     <l n="123">Again the same , for earth grew holy ground :</l>
     <l n="124">While in the silence of the mounting moon</l>
     <l n="125">Infinite love throbbed in the straining bound</l>
     <l n="126">Of that great kiss , the long-delaying boon ,</l>
     <l n="127">Granted indeed at last , but ended , ah ! so soon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="128">As the great sobbing fulness of the sea</l>
     <l n="129">Fills to the throat some void and aching cave ,</l>
     <l n="130">Till all its hollows tremble silently ,</l>
     <l n="131">Pressed with sweet weight of softly-lapping wave :</l>
     <l n="132">So kissed those mighty lovers glad and brave .</l>
     <l n="133">And as a sky from which the sun has gone</l>
     <l n="134">Trembles all night with all the stars he gave</l>
     <l n="135">A firmament of memories of the sun ,—</l>
     <l n="136">So thrilled and thrilled each life when that great kiss was done .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="137">But coward shame that had no word to say</l>
     <l n="138">In passion 's hour , with sudden icy clang</l>
     <l n="139">Slew the bright morn , and through the tarnished day</l>
     <l n="140">An iron bell from light to darkness rang :</l>
     <l n="141">She shut her ears because a throstle sang ,</l>
     <l n="142">She dare not hear the little innocent bird ,</l>
     <l n="143">And a white flower made her poor head to hang —</l>
     <l n="144">To be so white ! once she was white as curd ,</l>
     <l n="145">But now — ‘ Alack ! ’ ‘ Alack ! ’ She speaks no other word .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="146">The pearly line on yonder hills afar</l>
     <l n="147">Within the dawn , when mounts the lark and sings</l>
     <l n="148">By the great angel of the morning star ,—</l>
     <l n="149">That was his love , and all free fair fresh things</l>
     <l n="150">That move and glitter while the daylight springs :</l>
     <l n="151">To thus know love , and yet to spoil love thus !</l>
     <l n="152">To lose the dream — O silly beating wings —</l>
     <l n="153">Great dream so splendid and miraculous :</l>

     <l n="1">‘ The daffodils are fine this year , ’ I said ;</l>
     <l n="2">‘ O yes , but see my crocuses , ’ said she .</l>
     <l n="3">And so we entered in and sat at talk</l>
     <l n="4">Within a little parlour bowered about</l>
     <l n="5">With garden-noises , filled with garden scent ,</l>
     <l n="6">As some sweet sea-shell rings with pearly chimes</l>
     <l n="7">And sighs out fragrance of its mother 's breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">We sat at talk , and all the afternoon</l>
     <l n="9">Whispered about in changing silences</l>
     <l n="10">Of flush and sudden light and gathering shade ,</l>
     <l n="11">As though some Maestro drew out organ stops</l>
     <l n="12">Somewhere in heaven . As two within a boat</l>
     <l n="13">On the wide sea we sat at talk , the hours</l>
     <l n="14">Lapping unheeded round us as the waves .</l>
     <l n="15">And as such two will ofttimes pause in speech ,</l>
     <l n="16">Gaze at high heaven and draw deep to their hearts</l>
     <l n="17">The infinite azure , then meet eyes again</l>
     <l n="18">And flash it to each other ; without words</l>
     <l n="19">First , and then with voice trembling as trumpets</l>
     <l n="20">Tremble with fierce breath , voice cadenced too</l>
     <l n="21">As deep as the deep sea , Aeolian voice ,</l>
     <l n="22">Voice of star-spaces , and the pine-wood 's voice</l>
     <l n="23">In dewy mornings , Life 's own awful voice :</l>
     <l n="24">So did We talk , gazing with God 's own eyes</l>
     <l n="25">Into Life 's deeps — ah , how they throbbed with stars !</l>
     <l n="26">And were we not ourselves like pulsing suns</l>
     <l n="27">Who , once an aeon met within the void ,</l>
     <l n="28">So fiery close , forget how far away</l>
     <l n="29">Each orbit sweeps , and dream a little space</l>
     <l n="30">Of fiery wedding . So our hearts made answering</l>
     <l n="31">Lightnings all that afternoon through purple mists</l>
     <l n="32">Of riddled speech ; and when at last the sun ,</l>
     <l n="33">Our sentinel , made sign beneath the trees</l>
     <l n="34">Of coming night , and we arose and passed</l>
     <l n="35">Across the threshold to the flowers again ,</l>
     <l n="36">We knew a presence walking in the grove ,</l>
     <l n="37">And a voice speaking through the evening 's cool</l>
     <l n="38">Unknown before : though Love had wrought no wrong ,</l>
     <l n="39">His rune was spoken , and another rhyme</l>
     <l n="40">Writ in his poem by the master Life .</l>

     <l n="12">To match her face 's colour with the news :</l>
     <l n="13">While I in listening made a running gloss</l>
     <l n="14">Beneath her speech of all she left unsaid .</l>
     <l n="15">As — ‘ in the kitchen , ’ rather in the way ,</l>

     <l n="31">Landladies ’ sisters had no right to die</l>
     <l n="32">And taint the air for nervous lodger folk ;</l>
     <l n="33">Then smoothed his brow out into decency ,</l>
