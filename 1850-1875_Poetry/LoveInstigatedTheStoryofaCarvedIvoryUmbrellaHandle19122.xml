     <l n="21">But See the Sequel .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="22">It was not an Idol of India .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="23">It was the Carved Ivory Handle of a Tanned Gingham Umbrella , of very</l>
     <l n="24">Plebeian American Manufacture .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It stood in a Hand-painted China Receptacle in The long quiet Hall , in the House of a Friend . It was there when I Dined with him the Night After Christmas .</p>
   <p>It Gleamed at me with a Sinister Gleam of its Dexter Eye !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And it seemed to Smile and to Beckon at me out of the Soft , Voluptuous</l>
     <l n="2">Environment of The “ Inner · Sisterhood , ” of which it was a Fellow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And when we were seated at the Glittering Table , beautiful with Crystal</l>
     <l n="4">and Silver —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">And Lemonade and Cake —</l>

     <l n="6">An Esthetic Banquet —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="7">It Chanced , by Merest Accident , that I was Given a seat opposite The</l>
     <l n="8">Portiered Archway which led into</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="9">The Long Quiet Hall ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="10">With its Wine-Colored Wealth of Turkish-Bath Toweling thrown back .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="11">And as we Sat Beneath the Iridescent Glow Of the Keely-Motor</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="12">Electric Lamp , which</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Glistened and Shimmered Its Stained-Glass Iridescence on all about it , and gave its hue to The Invigorating Beverage , we heeded not the Elemental war waging upon the Queen Anne Exterior of the Hospitable Mansion of my Friend .</p>
   <p>And when we were left to our Coffee and our Pipes , we talked of Daggers , and Epitaphs , and Tombs !</p>
   <p>And as he told me in a Mysterious Whisper the Story of the Malay Dagger , “ Guiltless of all Guile , ” the Vitreous Eye of that Quaintly Carved Odalisque — for such my fevered fancy Pictured it — was ever Glaring at me with its Sinister Glare !</p>
   <p>And when our Ghostly Talk was Interrupted By the Entrance of other Guests , I Quaffed Another Crystal Goblet of My Friend 's Brain-Maddening Concoction , and casting a long , lingering Look at the Persian Rug which hid the Graeco-Romanesque Architecture of the vaulted Ceiling , I passed from the Gothic Portals of this Esthetic Shrine into the outer darkness — beyond the glamour of the Seven Lamps of Architecture .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But ,— Oh Fitful Fate !— as I passed though The Long , Quiet Hall and</l>
     <l n="2">by the wine-colored Plush Corner from whose Voluptuous Shadow The</l>
     <l n="3">Sinister-Eyed , Carved-Ivory-Handle Odalisque cast an Alluring ,</l>
     <l n="4">Appealing Look toward Me , and all Unconsciously , Unintentionally , and</l>
     <l n="5">Unresistingly I Took it from its Hand-Painted China Receptacle , and</l>
     <l n="6">closing the Heavy doors of Rolled , Cathedral Plate Glass After me ,</l>
     <l n="7">I Unfurled its Sun-Tanned Gingham Folds to the aforementioned warring</l>
     <l n="8">elements . And as I Wended my Desolate Way to the Sainted Shrine of</l>
     <l n="9">Pendennis , my Seething Brain Peopled the Valley of Unrest with Elfs ,</l>
     <l n="10">And Ravens and Brahman Gods , and the Dagger whose blood-stain belonged</l>
     <l n="11">to a Venetian Duke . When I Presently Entered the Resounding Cloisters of</l>
     <l n="12">the Order of ST. PENDENNIS — when I entered this “ House without a Woman ”</l>
     <l n="13">I sought the seclusion of a dark , Wine-Colored , Plush-Lined Cell , and</l>
     <l n="14">carelessly placing the Tanned Gingham , Vegetable-Ivory-handled Umbrella</l>
     <l n="15">on the Eighteenth Century Hearth before me ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">I threw my mentally-exhausted frame into a a Massive , Damask-covered</l>
     <l n="17">Chair with heavily-carved Arms of highly-polished Oak , and sounded the</l>
     <l n="18">Tiny , Tintinnabulating Call-Bell for Something to Counteract the Effects</l>
     <l n="19">of the Too-exhilerating Potables of my Friend , and his no less Harrowing</l>
     <l n="20">Stories !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But while I thus sat waiting , with my feet to The Comfortable Fire , all at once my Gaze was Unconsciously , Unintentionally and Unresistingly Transfixed by the Sinister Glance of The Dexter Eye of the Carved-Ivory Odalisque .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And as I sat there in the Twilight Glare of the Slowly-Consuming</l>
     <l n="2">Embers on the Wide and Deep , Old-Fashioned , Open Fire-place , with</l>
     <l n="3">Lacquered-Brass Fire-Dogs — beneath the Spell of those Stealthy , Roguish</l>
     <l n="4">Glances , I , against My Wish and Will , was led to Think of The dark ,</l>
     <l n="5">strange and weirdly grotesque things of which My Friend had Told me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And finally , as under the Strange Fascination of the Vitreous Dexter and Sinister Eyes of The Carved-Ivory Odalisque , which Held me Spell-Bound , I Learned from the Thin , Curled Lips of the said Carved-Ivory Odalisque its Own Story .</p>
   <p>It was not Created by Love .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Nor was it in Itself the Embodiment of Love . But it Bore in one of its</l>
     <l n="2">Flexible Ribs the Tangible Evidence of the Adhesive Qualities of a Love</l>
     <l n="3">Driven Back upon itself ,— the Concentration of an Otherwise Wasted</l>
     <l n="4">Force .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Less than a Thousand Years ago , a Dudish Roderick Dhu stood Flustrated with Fiery Indignation , face to face with a Maiden Priestess — a Prideful , Haughty Woman !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">It was on the Rue Quatrieme . It was at the Intersection of two great</l>
     <l n="2">Thoroughfares .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Clouds had Parted their Bangs in the Middle , and were Shimmering their Crystal Drops of Distilled Ocean in torrental volume upon the Luckless Wayfarers .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">It chanced that the Prideful Maiden Priestess Was Hurrying adown the</l>
     <l n="2">Boulevard with the Self-same Carved-Ivory-Handled Umbrella Closely</l>
     <l n="3">Clasped in Her Delicate Marie Antoinette fingers . She was thus Ensconced</l>
     <l n="4">Behind the Sheltering Tautness of the Stout-ribbed Gingham Umbrella</l>
     <l n="5">With the Carved-Ivory Handle , when she passed out of the Shadow of The</l>
     <l n="6">Massive Marble Edifice of Gothic Architecture and turned into the Rue</l>
     <l n="7">de la Chataigne — and Unconsciously , Unintentionally and Unresistingly</l>
     <l n="8">Punched a Tear out of the Dexter Eye of the Resistless Roderick Dhu !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am sure that Carved-Ivory , Oggling Odalisque was to Blame ! I am sure that it Wantonly Drove the Spare Rib of the Stout Gingham Umbrella to the Accomplishment of its own Foul Purpose !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Prideful Maiden Priestess had great Commiseration for the Ardent</l>
     <l n="2">Roderick .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">She Frankly Told him so .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And in a Tacit but Potent — Oh , so Potent — Way , bade him , if he liked , to go with her to her Shrine and there have his Weeping Wounds Bound up with “ a Bit of East India Silk , ” — at her Shrine , whose Doors should ever be Open to Him .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Oh ! Chance , Fortuitous Chance ! How many Followers of St. Pendennis are</l>
     <l n="2">Annually Ensnared in thy Name !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Ere Long ,— within a Month , a Little Month — the Dudish Roderick Dhu was a cringing devotee at the Vestal Shrine of the Maiden Priestess , Praying that she should receive all his Suppliant Love , and “ right smart ” of his devotion . He would never leave Her Side . He would Never , never Smile on other Maidens . He would Sacrifice each Trusted and Trusting Friend and Creditor . She MUST receive his Heart and Hand , and his Partially-Eclipsed Occular !</p>
   <p>Else , where , all the while , was all this Wealth of Passionate Love to go to — If it was Spurned and Sent Back to its Donor ? Who would have it Second-Handed ?</p>
   <p>This was , indeed , a Poser .</p>
   <p>It was Unanswerable !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">She did not Attempt to Answer it . She only Considered the First</l>
     <l n="2">Proposition .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And she Thought of the Cruel , Cruel Deed Which she had been Led</l>
     <l n="4">by the Vitreous-Eyed Odalisque of Carved-Ivory to Unintentionally ,</l>
     <l n="5">Unconsciously , and Unresistingly Perpetrate Upon Him ; And — to cut a</l>
     <l n="6">Short Story shorter — she cast her ‘ Mind 's Eye , Horatio , ’ upon his Queen</l>
     <l n="7">Anne Mansion Front , and Determined to Bestow upon the Injured Innocent</l>
     <l n="8">what remained — after Five Seasons — of the Wealth of Her Young Love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">— Thus Simply is Love Instigated .—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Had the Maiden Princess Refused him her Silver-Tinged Love — Had she</l>
     <l n="11">Spurned and Thrown back upon his Hands his Passion torn To Tatters — he</l>
     <l n="12">Might Have Perpetuated his Love by Writing “ a Book Without a Woman , ” or</l>
     <l n="13">Better still , he Might Have Spent the Force of his Extravagant Passion</l>
     <l n="14">by Executing , in Endless number and variety , Patent Ivory-handled</l>
     <l n="15">Umbrellas , Quaintly Carved in the Verisimility of the Oggling Odalisque ,</l>
     <l n="16">which Impelled the Hand that Instigated his Love by Peeling his Dexter</l>
     <l n="17">Eye .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But , Alas ! The Thoughtless Pair of Innocents did not Consider that their Love , being Mutual , Must , by the Decree of St. Douglass , die — Unperpetuated — with Them !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Or , if they Weighed the Dire Decree in the Balances of their Social</l>
     <l n="2">Philosophy , I Doubt Not that they Considered that if they Perpetuated</l>
     <l n="3">their Love the Length of their Natural Lives they Would have</l>
     <l n="4">Accomplished Enough . And , methinks their Heads were Equipoised . This</l>
     <l n="5">Work-a-Day World has all the Dudish Booklets and Carved-Ivory Dagger and</l>
     <l n="6">Umbrella Handles that it can Easily Carry . Let not Another Booklet break</l>
     <l n="7">Old Atlas ’ Back .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">And “ Douglass , O Douglass , Tender and True , ” Carve for us no more</l>
     <l n="9">Heathen Gods of Love . E'en now Their Occupation 's Gone .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Star-Eyed Goddess that Shines Forth From the Glittering Surface of the Almighty Dollar is Goddess Potent enough to Perpetuate the Love of this Day and Generation , even as by her Influence often is</p>
   <p>Love Instigated .</p>
   <p>But the Quaintly Carved Vegetable-Ivory Odalisque Handle of the Tanned-Gingham Umbrella that Rested in the Hand-Painted China Receptacle that Stood in the Voluptuous Environment of the Wine-Colored Plush Corner of the Long , Quiet Hall of the House of a Friend Where I Supped the Night after Christmas — [ Was this the House that Zack Built ? ] — It still Glared at me with a Sinister Gleam of its Dexter Eye as it Oggled me from its Place on the Hearth of the Wine-Scented Cell — Plush-Lined Cell — in the Cloistered Precincts of Saint Pendennis .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It seemed to Smile a Ready , Garrulous Assent to all that which I have</l>
     <l n="2">Said .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">These Words it Seemed to Murmur :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Oh ! Thou Unmitigated Umbrella-Theif ! Return Me to the home of those whose Love I Instigated , whose Happy Household I am Responsible for . Wake ye ! Sleeping Son of Pendennis , or by the Goddess Si [ l ] va , I will Execute Dire Vengeance Upon you !</p>
   <p>Even as I once was the Instigator of Love , upon You may be ,</p>
   <p>Love Instigated !</p>
