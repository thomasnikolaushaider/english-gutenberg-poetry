      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I sing no idle songs of dalliance days ,</l>
       <l n="2">No dreams Elysian inspire my rhyming ;</l>
       <l n="3">I have no Celia to enchant my lays ,</l>
       <l n="4">No pipes of Pan have set my heart to chiming .</l>
       <l n="5">I am no wordsmith dripping gems divine</l>
       <l n="6">Into the golden chalice of a sonnet ;</l>
       <l n="7">If love songs witch you , close this book of mine ,</l>
       <l n="8">Waste no time on it .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Yet bring I to my work an eager joy ,</l>
       <l n="10">A lusty love of life and all things human ;</l>
       <l n="11">Still in me leaps the wonder of the boy ,</l>
       <l n="12">A pride in man , a deathless faith in woman .</l>
       <l n="13">Still red blood calls , still rings the valiant fray ;</l>
       <l n="14">Adventure beacons through the summer gloaming :</l>
       <l n="15">Oh long and long and long will be the day</l>
       <l n="16">Ere I come homing !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">This earth is ours to love : lute , brush and pen ,</l>
       <l n="18">They are but tongues to tell of life sincerely ;</l>
       <l n="19">The thaumaturgic Day , the might of men ,</l>
       <l n="20">O God of Scribes , grant us to grave them clearly !</l>
       <l n="21">Grant heart that homes in heart , then all is well .</l>
       <l n="22">Honey is honey-sweet , howe'er the hiving .</l>
       <l n="23">Each to his work , his wage at evening bell</l>
       <l n="24">The strength of striving .</l>

       <l n="2">There 's sunshine in the heart of me ,</l>
       <l n="3">My blood sings in the breeze ;</l>
       <l n="4">The mountains are a part of me ,</l>
       <l n="5">I 'm fellow to the trees .</l>
       <l n="6">My golden youth I 'm squandering ,</l>
       <l n="7">Sun-libertine am I ;</l>
       <l n="8">A-wandering , a-wandering ,</l>
       <l n="9">Until the day I die .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">I was once , I declare , a Stone-Age man ,</l>
       <l n="11">And I roomed in the cool of a cave ;</l>

       <l n="13">The fret and the sweat of a slave :</l>
       <l n="14">For far over all that folks hold worth ,</l>
       <l n="15">There lives and there leaps in me</l>
       <l n="16">A love of the lowly things of earth ,</l>
       <l n="17">And a passion to be free .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">To pitch my tent with no prosy plan ,</l>

       <l n="21">To seek Adventure 's thrill .</l>
       <l n="22">Carefree to be , as a bird that sings ;</l>
       <l n="23">To go my own sweet way ;</l>
       <l n="24">To reck not at all what may befall ,</l>
       <l n="25">But to live and to love each day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="26">To make my body a temple pure</l>
       <l n="27">Wherein I dwell serene ;</l>
       <l n="28">To care for the things that shall endure ,</l>
       <l n="29">The simple , sweet and clean .</l>
       <l n="30">To oust out envy and hate and rage ,</l>
       <l n="31">To breathe with no alarm ;</l>
       <l n="32">For Nature shall be my anchorage ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="34">To shun all lures that debauch the soul ,</l>
       <l n="35">The orgied rites of the rich ;</l>
       <l n="36">To eat my crust as a rover must</l>
       <l n="37">With the rough-neck down in the ditch .</l>
       <l n="38">To trudge by his side whate'er betide ;</l>
       <l n="39">To share his fire at night ;</l>
       <l n="40">To call him friend to the long trail-end ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="42">To scorn all strife , and to view all life</l>
       <l n="43">With the curious eyes of a child ;</l>
       <l n="44">From the plangent sea to the prairie ,</l>
       <l n="45">From the slum to the heart of the Wild .</l>
       <l n="46">From the red-rimmed star to the speck of sand ,</l>
       <l n="47">From the vast to the greatly small ;</l>
       <l n="48">For I know that the whole for good is planned ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="50">To see it all , the wide world-way ,</l>
       <l n="51">From the fig-leaf belt to the Pole ;</l>
       <l n="52">With never a one to say me nay ,</l>
       <l n="53">And none to cramp my soul .</l>
       <l n="54">In belly-pinch I will pay the price ,</l>
       <l n="55">But God ! let me be free ;</l>
       <l n="56">For once I know in the long ago ,</l>
       <l n="57">They made a slave of me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="58">In a flannel shirt from earth 's clean dirt ,</l>

       <l n="61">Nor seek to understand .</l>
       <l n="62">To ENJOY is good enough for me ;</l>
       <l n="63">The gipsy of God am I ;</l>
       <l n="64">Then here 's a hail to each flaring dawn !</l>
       <l n="65">And here 's a cheer to the night that 's gone !</l>
       <l n="66">And may I go a-roaming on</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="68">Then every star shall sing to me</l>
       <l n="69">Its song of liberty ;</l>
       <l n="70">And every morn shall bring to me</l>
       <l n="71">Its mandate to be free .</l>
       <l n="72">In every throbbing vein of me</l>
       <l n="73">I 'll feel the vast Earth-call ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">“ Deny your God ! ” they ringed me with their spears ;</l>
       <l n="3">Blood-crazed were they , and reeking from the strife ;</l>
       <l n="4">Hell-hot their hate , and venom-fanged their sneers ,</l>
       <l n="5">And one man spat on me and nursed a knife .</l>
       <l n="6">And there was I , sore wounded and alone ,</l>
       <l n="7">I , the last living of my slaughtered band .</l>
       <l n="8">Oh sinister the sky , and cold as stone !</l>
       <l n="9">In one red laugh of horror reeled the land .</l>
       <l n="10">And dazed and desperate I faced their spears ,</l>
       <l n="11">And like a flame out-leaped that naked knife ,</l>
       <l n="12">And like a serpent stung their bitter jeers :</l>
       <l n="13">“ Deny your God , and we will give you life . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="14">Deny my God ! Oh life was very sweet !</l>
       <l n="15">And it is hard in youth and hope to die ;</l>
       <l n="16">And there my comrades dear lay at my feet ,</l>
       <l n="17">And in that blear of blood soon must I lie .</l>
       <l n="18">And yet . . . I almost laughed — it seemed so odd ,</l>
       <l n="19">For long and long had I not vainly tried</l>
       <l n="20">To reason out and body forth my God ,</l>
       <l n="21">And prayed for light , and doubted — and DENIED :</l>
       <l n="22">Denied the Being I could not conceive ,</l>
       <l n="23">Denied a life-to-be beyond the grave . . . .</l>
       <l n="24">And now they ask me , who do not believe ,</l>
       <l n="25">Just to deny , to voice my doubt , to save</l>
       <l n="26">This life of mine that sings so in the sun ,</l>
       <l n="27">The bloom of youth yet red upon my cheek ,</l>
       <l n="28">My only life ! — O fools ! ‘ tis easy done ,</l>
       <l n="29">I will deny . . . and yet I do not speak .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="30">“ Deny your God ! ” their spears are all agleam ,</l>
       <l n="31">And I can see their eyes with blood-lust shine ;</l>
       <l n="32">Their snarling voices shrill into a scream ,</l>
       <l n="33">And , mad to slay , they quiver for the sign .</l>
       <l n="34">Deny my God ! yes , I could do it well ;</l>
       <l n="35">Yet if I did , what of my race , my name ?</l>
       <l n="36">How they would spit on me , these dogs of hell !</l>
       <l n="37">Spurn me , and put on me the brand of shame .</l>
       <l n="38">A white man 's honour ! what of that , I say ?</l>
       <l n="39">Shall these black curs cry “ Coward ” in my face ?</l>
       <l n="40">They who would perish for their gods of clay —</l>
       <l n="41">Shall I defile my country and my race ?</l>
       <l n="42">My country ! what 's my country to me now ?</l>
       <l n="43">Soldier of Fortune , free and far I roam ;</l>
       <l n="44">All men are brothers in my heart , I vow ;</l>
       <l n="45">The wide and wondrous world is all my home .</l>
       <l n="46">My country ! reverent of her splendid Dead ,</l>
       <l n="47">Her heroes proud , her martyrs pierced with pain :</l>
       <l n="48">For me her puissant blood was vainly shed ;</l>
       <l n="49">For me her drums of battle beat in vain ,</l>
       <l n="50">And free I fare , half-heedless of her fate :</l>
       <l n="51">No faith , no flag I owe — then why not seek</l>
       <l n="52">This last loop-hole of life ? Why hesitate ?</l>
       <l n="53">I will deny . . . and yet I do not speak .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="54">“ Deny your God ! ” their spears are poised on high ,</l>
       <l n="55">And tense and terrible they wait the word ;</l>
       <l n="56">And dark and darker glooms the dreary sky ,</l>
       <l n="57">And in that hush of horror no thing stirred .</l>
       <l n="58">Then , through the ringing terror and sheer hate</l>
       <l n="59">Leaped there a vision to me — Oh , how far !</l>
       <l n="60">A face , Her face . . . through all my stormy fate</l>
       <l n="61">A joy , a strength , a glory and a star .</l>
       <l n="62">Beneath the pines , where lonely camp-fires gleam ,</l>
       <l n="63">In seas forlorn , amid the deserts drear ,</l>
       <l n="64">How I had gladdened to that face of dream !</l>
       <l n="65">And never , never had it seemed so dear .</l>
       <l n="66">O silken hair that veils the sunny brow !</l>
       <l n="67">O eyes of grey , so tender and so true !</l>
       <l n="68">O lips of smiling sweetness ! must I now</l>
       <l n="69">For ever and for ever go from you ?</l>
       <l n="70">Ah , yes , I must . . . for if I do this thing ,</l>
       <l n="71">How can I look into your face again ?</l>
       <l n="72">Knowing you think me more than half a king ,</l>
       <l n="73">I with my craven heart , my honour slain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="74">No ! no ! my mind 's made up . I gaze above ,</l>
       <l n="75">Into that sky insensate as a stone ;</l>
       <l n="76">Not for my creed , my country , but my Love</l>
       <l n="77">Will I stand up and meet my death alone .</l>
       <l n="78">Then though it be to utter dark I sink ,</l>
       <l n="79">The God that dwells in me is not denied ;</l>

        <l n="136">Such a strange , antic visioning I had :</l>
        <l n="137">Lo ! it did seem HER EYES WERE OPEN WIDE .</l>
        <l n="138">Surely I must have dreamed ! I stared once more . . . .</l>
        <l n="139">No , ‘ twas a candle 's trick , a shadow cast .</l>
        <l n="140">There were her lashes locking as before .</l>
        <l n="141">( Oh , but it filled me with a joy so vast ! )</l>
        <l n="142">No , ‘ twas a freak , a fancy of the brain ,</l>
        <l n="143">( Oh , but to-night I 'll try again , again ! )</l>

     <p>It was no dream ; now do I know that Love Leapt from the starry battlements of Death ; For in my vigil as I bent above , Calling her name with eager , burning breath , Sudden there came a change : again I saw The radiance of the rose-leaf stain her cheek ; Rivers of rapture thrilled in sunny thaw ; Cleft were her coral lips as if to speak ; Curved were her tender arms as if to cling ; Open the flower-like eyes of lucent blue , Looking at me with love so pitying That I could fancy Heaven shining through . “ Sunshine , ” I faltered , “ stay with me , oh , stay ! ” Yet ere I finished , in a moment 's flight , There in her angel purity she lay — Ah ! but I know she 'll come again to-night . EVEN AS RADIANT SWORD LEAPS FROM THE SHEATH , SOUL FROM THE BODY LEAPS — WE CALL IT DEATH .</p>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">When the boys come out from Lac Labiche in the lure of the early Spring ,</l>
       <l n="3">To take the pay of the “ Hudson 's Bay ” , as their fathers did before ,</l>
       <l n="4">They are all a-glee for the jamboree , and they make the Landing ring</l>
       <l n="5">With a whoop and a whirl , and a “ Grab your girl ” ,</l>
       <l n="6">and a rip and a skip and a roar .</l>
       <l n="7">For the spree of Spring is a sacred thing , and the boys must have their fun ;</l>
       <l n="8">Packer and tracker and half-breed Cree , from the boat to the bar they leap ;</l>
       <l n="9">And then when the long flotilla goes , and the last of their pay is done ,</l>
       <l n="10">The boys from the banks of Lac Labiche swing to the heavy sweep .</l>
       <l n="11">And oh , how they sigh ! and their throats are dry ,</l>
       <l n="12">and sorry are they and sick :</l>
       <l n="13">Yet there 's none so cursed with a lime-kiln thirst as that Athabaska Dick .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="14">He was long and slim and lean of limb , but strong as a stripling bear ;</l>
       <l n="15">And by the right of his skill and might he guided the Long Brigade .</l>
       <l n="16">All water-wise were his laughing eyes , and he steered with a careless care ,</l>
       <l n="17">And he shunned the shock of foam and rock , till they came to the Big Cascade .</l>
       <l n="18">And here they must make the long portage , and the boys sweat in the sun ;</l>
       <l n="19">And they heft and pack , and they haul and track , and each must do his trick ;</l>
       <l n="20">But their thoughts are far in the Landing bar ,</l>
       <l n="21">where the founts of nectar run :</l>
       <l n="22">And no man thinks of such gorgeous drinks as that Athabaska Dick .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="23">‘ Twas the close of day and his long boat lay just over the Big Cascade ,</l>
       <l n="24">When there came to him one Jack-pot Jim , with a wild light in his eye ;</l>
       <l n="25">And he softly laughed , and he led Dick aft , all eager , yet half afraid ,</l>
       <l n="26">And snugly stowed in his coat he showed a pilfered flask of “ rye ” .</l>
       <l n="27">And in haste he slipped , or in fear he tripped ,</l>
       <l n="28">but — Dick in warning roared —</l>
       <l n="29">And there rang a yell , and it befell that Jim was overboard .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="30">Oh , I heard a splash , and quick as a flash I knew he could not swim .</l>
       <l n="31">I saw him whirl in the river swirl , and thresh his arms about .</l>
       <l n="32">In a queer , strained way I heard Dick say : “ I 'm going after him , ”</l>
       <l n="33">Throw off his coat , leap down the boat — and then I gave a shout :</l>
       <l n="34">“ Boys , grab him , quick ! You 're crazy , Dick ! Far better one than two !</l>
       <l n="35">Hell , man ! You know you 've got no show ! It 's sure and certain death . . . . ”</l>
       <l n="36">And there we hung , and there we clung , with beef and brawn and thew ,</l>
       <l n="37">And sinews cracked and joints were racked , and panting came our breath ;</l>
       <l n="38">And there we swayed and there we prayed , till strength and hope were spent —</l>
       <l n="39">Then Dick , he threw us off like rats , and after Jim he went .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="40">With mighty urge amid the surge of river-rage he leapt ,</l>
       <l n="41">And gripped his mate and desperate he fought to gain the shore ;</l>
       <l n="42">With teeth a-gleam he bucked the stream , yet swift and sure he swept</l>
       <l n="43">To meet the mighty cataract that waited all a-roar .</l>
       <l n="44">And there we stood like carven wood , our faces sickly white ,</l>
       <l n="45">And watched him as he beat the foam , and inch by inch he lost ;</l>
       <l n="46">And nearer , nearer drew the fall , and fiercer grew the fight ,</l>
       <l n="47">Till on the very cascade crest a last farewell he tossed .</l>
       <l n="48">Then down and down and down they plunged into that pit of dread ;</l>
       <l n="49">And mad we tore along the shore to claim our bitter dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="50">And from that hell of frenzied foam , that crashed and fumed and boiled ,</l>
       <l n="51">Two little bodies bubbled up , and they were heedless then ;</l>
       <l n="52">And oh , they lay like senseless clay ! and bitter hard we toiled ,</l>
       <l n="53">Yet never , never gleam of hope , and we were weary men .</l>
       <l n="54">And moments mounted into hours , and black was our despair ;</l>
       <l n="55">And faint were we , and we were fain to give them up as dead ,</l>
       <l n="56">When suddenly I thrilled with hope : “ Back , boys ! and give him air ;</l>
       <l n="57">I feel the flutter of his heart . . . . ” And , as the word I said ,</l>
       <l n="58">Dick gave a sigh , and gazed around , and saw our breathless band ;</l>
       <l n="59">And saw the sky 's blue floor above , all strewn with golden fleece ;</l>
       <l n="60">And saw his comrade Jack-pot Jim , and touched him with his hand :</l>
       <l n="61">And then there came into his eyes a look of perfect peace .</l>
       <l n="62">And as there , at his very feet , the thwarted river raved ,</l>
       <l n="63">I heard him murmur low and deep :</l>
       <l n="64">“ Thank God ! the WHISKEY 's saved . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">At dawn of day the white land lay all gruesome-like and grim ,</l>
       <l n="3">When Bill Mc'Gee he says to me : “ We 've GOT to do it , Jim .</l>
       <l n="4">We 've got to make Fort Liard quick . I know the river 's bad ,</l>
       <l n="5">But , oh ! the little woman 's sick . . . why ! do n't you savvy , lad ? ”</l>
       <l n="6">And me ! Well , yes , I must confess it was n't hard to see</l>
       <l n="7">Their little family group of two would soon be one of three .</l>
       <l n="8">And so I answered , careless-like : “ Why , Bill ! you do n't suppose</l>
       <l n="9">I 'm scared of that there ‘ babbling brook ’ ? Whatever you say — goes . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">A real live man was Barb-wire Bill , with insides copper-lined ;</l>
       <l n="11">For “ barb-wire ” was the brand of “ hooch ” to which he most inclined .</l>
       <l n="12">They knew him far ; his igloos are on Kittiegazuit strand .</l>
       <l n="13">They knew him well , the tribes who dwell within the Barren Land .</l>
       <l n="14">From Koyokuk to Kuskoquim his fame was everywhere ;</l>
       <l n="15">And he did love , all life above , that little Julie Claire ,</l>
       <l n="16">The lithe , white slave-girl he had bought for seven hundred skins ,</l>
       <l n="17">And taken to his wickiup to make his moccasins .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">We crawled down to the river bank and feeble folk were we ,</l>
       <l n="19">That Julie Claire from God-knows-where , and Barb-wire Bill and me .</l>
       <l n="20">From shore to shore we heard the roar the heaving ice-floes make ,</l>
       <l n="21">And loud we laughed , and launched our raft , and followed in their wake .</l>
       <l n="22">The river swept and seethed and leapt , and caught us in its stride ;</l>
       <l n="23">And on we hurled amid a world that crashed on every side .</l>
       <l n="24">With sullen din the banks caved in ; the shore-ice lanced the stream ;</l>
       <l n="25">The naked floes like spooks arose , all jiggling and agleam .</l>
       <l n="26">Black anchor-ice of strange device shot upward from its bed ,</l>
       <l n="27">As night and day we cleft our way , and arrow-like we sped .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="28">But “ Faster still ! ” cried Barb-wire Bill , and looked the live-long day</l>
       <l n="29">In dull despair at Julie Claire , as white like death she lay .</l>
       <l n="30">And sometimes he would seem to pray and sometimes seem to curse ,</l>
       <l n="31">And bent above , with eyes of love , yet ever she grew worse .</l>
       <l n="32">And as we plunged and leapt and lunged , her face was plucked with pain ,</l>
       <l n="33">And I could feel his nerves of steel a-quiver at the strain .</l>
       <l n="34">And in the night he gripped me tight as I lay fast asleep :</l>
       <l n="35">“ The river 's kicking like a steer . . . run out the forward sweep !</l>
       <l n="36">That 's Hell-gate Canyon right ahead ; I know of old its roar ,</l>
       <l n="37">And . . . I 'll be damned ! THE ICE IS JAMMED ! We 've GOT to make the shore . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="38">With one wild leap I gripped the sweep . The night was black as sin .</l>
       <l n="39">The float-ice crashed and ripped and smashed , and stunned us with its din .</l>
       <l n="40">And near and near , and clear and clear I heard the canyon boom ;</l>
       <l n="41">And swift and strong we swept along to meet our awful doom .</l>
       <l n="42">And as with dread I glimpsed ahead the death that waited there ,</l>
       <l n="43">My only thought was of the girl , the little Julie Claire ;</l>
       <l n="44">And so , like demon mad with fear , I panted at the oar ,</l>
       <l n="45">And foot by foot , and inch by inch , we worked the raft ashore .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="46">The bank was staked with grinding ice , and as we scraped and crashed ,</l>
       <l n="47">I only knew one thing to do , and through my mind it flashed :</l>
       <l n="48">Yet while I groped to find the rope , I heard Bill 's savage cry :</l>
       <l n="49">“ That 's my job , lad ! It 's me that jumps . I 'll snub this raft or die ! ”</l>
       <l n="50">I saw him leap , I saw him creep , I saw him gain the land ;</l>
       <l n="51">I saw him crawl , I saw him fall , then run with rope in hand .</l>
       <l n="52">And then the darkness gulped him up , and down we dashed once more ,</l>
       <l n="53">And nearer , nearer drew the jam , and thunder-like its roar .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="54">Oh God ! all 's lost . . . from Julie Claire there came a wail of pain ,</l>
       <l n="55">And then — the rope grew sudden taut , and quivered at the strain ;</l>
       <l n="56">It slacked and slipped , it whined and gripped , and oh , I held my breath !</l>
       <l n="57">And there we hung and there we swung right in the jaws of death .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="58">A little strand of hempen rope , and how I watched it there ,</l>
       <l n="59">With all around a hell of sound , and darkness and despair ;</l>
       <l n="60">A little strand of hempen rope , I watched it all alone ,</l>
       <l n="61">And somewhere in the dark behind I heard a woman moan ;</l>
       <l n="62">And somewhere in the dark ahead I heard a man cry out ,</l>
       <l n="63">Then silence , silence , silence fell , and mocked my hollow shout .</l>
       <l n="64">And yet once more from out the shore I heard that cry of pain ,</l>
       <l n="65">A moan of mortal agony , then all was still again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="66">That night was hell with all the frills , and when the dawn broke dim ,</l>
       <l n="67">I saw a lean and level land , but never sign of him .</l>
       <l n="68">I saw a flat and frozen shore of hideous device ,</l>
       <l n="69">I saw a long-drawn strand of rope that vanished through the ice .</l>
       <l n="70">And on that treeless , rockless shore I found my partner — dead .</l>
       <l n="71">No place was there to snub the raft , so — HE HAD SERVED INSTEAD ;</l>
       <l n="72">And with the rope lashed round his waist , in last defiant fight ,</l>
       <l n="73">He 'd thrown himself beneath the ice , that closed and gripped him tight ;</l>
       <l n="74">And there he 'd held us back from death , as fast in death he lay . . . .</l>
       <l n="75">Say , boys ! I 'm not the pious brand , but — I just tried to pray .</l>
       <l n="76">And then I looked to Julie Claire , and sore abashed was I ,</l>
       <l n="77">For from the robes that covered her , I — HEARD — A — BABY — CRY . . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="78">Thus was Love conqueror of death , and life for life was given ;</l>

       <l n="84">And the first from her heels to her dainty head</l>
       <l n="85">Was charming in every sense of the word :</l>
       <l n="86">And yet in the past ( I grieve to state ) ,</l>
       <l n="87">She never had been exactly “ straight ” .</l>

       <l n="88">And the second — she was beyond all cavil ,</l>
       <l n="89">A model of virtue , I must confess ;</l>
       <l n="90">And yet , alas ! she was dull as the devil ,</l>
       <l n="91">And rather a dowd in the way of dress ;</l>

       <l n="6">The man-size mountains palisade us round on every side ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="81">An ’ so next day he hurried back with smoothly shaven pate ,</l>

       <l n="83">‘ Twas mighty frenzied finance an ’ the boys set up a roar ,</l>

       <l n="2">In the moonless , misty night , with my little pipe alight ,</l>

       <l n="4">Oh , the dew is falling chill on the dim , deer-haunted hill ,</l>

       <l n="12">When I sped the hours away with the gayest of the gay</l>
       <l n="13">In the giddy whirl of fashion 's festal throng .</l>
       <l n="14">Oh , I ran a grilling race and I little recked the pace ,</l>
       <l n="15">For the lust of youth ran riot in my blood ;</l>
       <l n="16">But at last I made a stand in this God-forsaken land</l>

       <l n="42">Then the boys will gather round , and they 'll launch me in the ground ,</l>

       <l n="2">Smith , great writer of stories , drank ; found it immortalised his pen ;</l>
       <l n="3">Fused in his brain-pan , else a blank , heavens of glory now and then ;</l>
       <l n="4">Gave him the magical genius touch ; God-given power to gouge out , fling</l>
       <l n="5">Flat in your face a soul-thought — Bing !</l>
       <l n="6">Twiddle your heart-strings in his clutch .</l>
       <l n="7">“ Bah ! ” said Smith , “ let my body lie stripped to the buff in swinish shame ,</l>
       <l n="8">If I can blaze in the radiant sky out of adoring stars my name .</l>
       <l n="9">Sober am I nonentitized ; drunk am I more than half a god .</l>
       <l n="10">Well , let the flesh be sacrificed ; spirit shall speak and shame the clod .</l>
       <l n="11">Who would not gladly , gladly give Life to do one thing that will live ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="12">Smith had a friend , we 'll call him Brown ;</l>
       <l n="13">dearer than brothers were those two .</l>
       <l n="14">When in the wassail Smith would drown ,</l>
       <l n="15">Brown would rescue and pull him through .</l>
       <l n="16">When Brown was needful Smith would lend ; so it fell as the years went by ,</l>
       <l n="17">Each on the other would depend : then at the last Smith came to die .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">There Brown sat in the sick man 's room , still as a stone in his despair ;</l>
       <l n="19">Smith bent on him his eyes of doom , shook back his lion mane of hair ;</l>
       <l n="20">Said : “ Is there one in my chosen line , writer of forthright tales my peer ?</l>
       <l n="21">Look in that little desk of mine ; there is a package , bring it here .</l>
       <l n="22">Story of stories , gem of all ; essence and triumph , key and clue ;</l>
       <l n="23">Tale of a loving woman 's fall ; soul swept hell-ward , and God ! it 's true .</l>
       <l n="24">I was the man — Oh , yes , I 've paid , paid with mighty and mordant pain .</l>
       <l n="25">Look ! here 's the masterpiece I 've made out of my sin , my manhood slain .</l>
       <l n="26">Art supreme ! yet the world would stare , know my mistress and blaze my shame .</l>
       <l n="27">I have a wife and daughter — there ! take it and thrust it in the flame . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="28">Brown answered : “ Master , you have dipped</l>
       <l n="29">pen in your heart , your phrases sear .</l>
       <l n="30">Ruthless , unflinching , you have stripped naked your soul and set it here .</l>
       <l n="31">Have I not loved you well and true ? See ! between us the shadows drift ;</l>
       <l n="32">This bit of blood and tears means You — oh , let me have it , a parting gift .</l>
       <l n="33">Sacred I 'll hold it , a trust divine ; sacred your honour , her dark despair ;</l>
       <l n="34">Never shall it see printed line : here , by the living God I swear . ”</l>
       <l n="35">Brown on a Bible laid his hand ; Smith , great writer of stories , sighed :</l>
       <l n="36">“ Comrade , I trust you , and understand . Keep my secret ! ” And so he died .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="37">Smith was buried — up soared his sales ; lured you his books in every store ;</l>
       <l n="38">Exquisite , whimsy , heart-wrung tales ; men devoured them and craved for more .</l>
       <l n="39">So when it slyly got about Brown had a posthumous manuscript ,</l>
       <l n="40">Jones , the publisher , sought him out , into his pocket deep he dipped .</l>
       <l n="41">“ A thousand dollars ? ” Brown shook his head .</l>
       <l n="42">“ The story is not for sale , ” he said .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="43">Jones went away , then others came . Tempted and taunted , Brown was true .</l>
       <l n="44">Guarded at friendship 's shrine the fame</l>
       <l n="45">of the unpublished story grew and grew .</l>
       <l n="46">It 's a long , long lane that has no end ,</l>
       <l n="47">but some lanes end in the Potter 's field ;</l>
       <l n="48">Smith to Brown had been more than friend : patron , protector , spur and shield .</l>
       <l n="49">Poor , loving-wistful , dreamy Brown , long and lean , with a smile askew ,</l>
       <l n="50">Friendless he wandered up and down , gaunt as a wolf , as hungry too .</l>
       <l n="51">Brown with his lilt of saucy rhyme , Brown with his tilt of tender mirth</l>
       <l n="52">Garretless in the gloom and grime , singing his glad , mad songs of earth :</l>
       <l n="53">So at last with a faith divine , down and down to the Hunger-line .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="54">There as he stood in a woeful plight ,</l>

       <l n="56">Who should chance to behold his plight ,</l>
       <l n="57">but the publisher , the plethoric Jones ;</l>
       <l n="58">Peered at him for a little while , held out a bill : “ NOW , will you sell ? ”</l>
       <l n="59">Brown scanned it with his twisted smile :</l>
       <l n="60">“ A thousand dollars ! you go to hell ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="61">Brown enrolled in the homeless host , sleeping anywhere , anywhen ;</l>
       <l n="62">Suffered , strove , became a ghost , slave of the lamp for other men ;</l>
       <l n="63">For What'shYpppHeNhishYpppHeNname and So-and-so in the abyss his soul he stripped ,</l>
       <l n="64">Yet in his want , his worst of woe , held he fast to the manuscript .</l>
       <l n="65">Then one day as he chewed his pen , half in hunger and half despair ,</l>
       <l n="66">Creaked the door of his garret den ; Dick , his brother , was standing there .</l>
       <l n="67">Down on the pallet bed he sank , ashen his face , his voice a wail :</l>
       <l n="68">“ Save me , brother ! I 've robbed the bank ; to-morrow it 's ruin , capture , gaol .</l>
       <l n="69">Yet there 's a chance : I could to-day pay back the money , save our name ;</l>
       <l n="70">You have a manuscript , they say ,</l>
       <l n="71">worth a thousand — think , man ! the shame . . . . ”</l>
       <l n="72">Brown with his heart pain-pierced the while ,</l>
       <l n="73">with his stern , starved face , and his lips stone-pale ,</l>
       <l n="74">Shuddered and smiled his twisted smile : “ Brother , I guess you go to gaol . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="75">While poor Brown in the leer of dawn wrestled with God for the sacred fire ,</l>
       <l n="76">Came there a woman weak and wan , out of the mob , the murk , the mire ;</l>
       <l n="77">Frail as a reed , a fellow ghost , weary with woe , with sorrowing ;</l>
       <l n="78">Two pale souls in the legion lost ; lo ! Love bent with a tender wing ,</l>
       <l n="79">Taught them a joy so deep , so true ,</l>
       <l n="80">it seemed that the whole-world fabric shook ,</l>
       <l n="81">Thrilled and dissolved in radiant dew ; then Brown made him a golden book ,</l>
       <l n="82">Full of the faith that Life is good , that the earth is a dream divinely fair ,</l>
       <l n="83">Lauding his gem of womanhood in many a lyric rich and rare ;</l>
       <l n="84">Took it to Jones , who shook his head : “ I will consider it , ” he said .</l>

       <l n="85">While he considered , Brown 's wife lay clutched in the tentacles of pain ;</l>
       <l n="86">Then came the doctor , grave and grey ; spoke of decline , of nervous strain ;</l>
       <l n="87">Hinted Egypt , the South of France — Brown with terror was tiger-gripped .</l>

       <l n="89">A thousand dollars ! his only hope !</l>
       <l n="90">he gazed and gazed at the garret wall . . . .</l>
       <l n="91">Reached at last for the envelope , turned to his wife and told her all .</l>
       <l n="92">Told of his friend , his promise true ; told like his very heart would break :</l>
       <l n="93">“ Oh , my dearest ! what shall I do ? shall I not sell it for your sake ? ”</l>
       <l n="94">Ghostlike she lay , as still as doom ; turned to the wall her weary head ;</l>
       <l n="95">Icy-cold in the pallid gloom , silent as death . . . at last she said :</l>
       <l n="96">“ Do ! my husband ? Keep your vow ! Guard his secret and let me die . . . .</l>
       <l n="97">Oh , my dear , I must tell you now — THE WOMAN HE LOVED AND WRONGED WAS I ;</l>

       <l n="99">For a long , long time Brown did not speak ;</l>
       <l n="100">sat bleak-browed in the wretched room ;</l>
       <l n="101">Slowly a tear stole down his cheek ,</l>
       <l n="102">and he kissed her hand in the dismal gloom .</l>
       <l n="103">To break his oath , to brand her shame ;</l>
       <l n="104">his well-loved friend , his worshipped wife ;</l>
       <l n="105">To keep his vow , to save her name , yet at the cost of what ? Her life !</l>
       <l n="106">A moment 's space did he hesitate , a moment of pain and dread and doubt ,</l>
       <l n="107">Then he broke the seals , and , stern as fate ,</l>
       <l n="108">unfolded the sheets and spread them out . . . .</l>
       <l n="109">On his knees by her side he limply sank ,</l>

       <l n="2">O dear little cabin , I 've loved you so long ,</l>
       <l n="3">And now I must bid you good-bye !</l>
       <l n="4">I 've filled you with laughter , I 've thrilled you with song ,</l>
       <l n="5">And sometimes I 've wished I could cry .</l>
       <l n="6">Your walls they have witnessed a weariful fight ,</l>
       <l n="7">And rung to a won Waterloo :</l>
       <l n="8">But oh , in my triumph I 'm dreary to-night —</l>

       <l n="10">Your roof is bewhiskered , your floor is a-slant ,</l>
       <l n="11">Your walls seem to sag and to swing ;</l>
       <l n="12">I 'm trying to find just your faults , but I can n't —</l>
       <l n="13">You poor , tired , heart-broken old thing !</l>
       <l n="14">I 've seen when you 've been the best friend that I had ,</l>
       <l n="15">Your light like a gem on the snow ;</l>
       <l n="16">You 're sort of a part of me — Gee ! but I 'm sad ;</l>

       <l n="18">Below your cracked window red raspberries climb ;</l>

       <l n="21">And dimmed with tobacco and dream .</l>
       <l n="22">“ Each day has its laugh ” , and “ Do n't worry , just work ” .</l>
       <l n="23">Such mottoes reproachfully shine .</l>

       <l n="29">It 's Youth that I 'm leaving behind .</l>
       <l n="30">And often I 'll think of you , empty and black ,</l>
       <l n="31">Moose antlers nailed over your door :</l>
       <l n="32">Oh , if I should perish my ghost will come back</l>

       <l n="36">Oh , will you remember the lad with his dream !</l>
       <l n="37">The lad that you comforted so .</l>
       <l n="38">The shadows enfold you , it 's drawing to-night ;</l>
       <l n="39">The evening star needles the sky :</l>
       <l n="40">And huh ! but it 's stinging and stabbing my sight —</l>
