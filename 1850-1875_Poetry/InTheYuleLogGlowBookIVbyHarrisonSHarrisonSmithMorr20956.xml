    <head>THE MASQUE OF CHRISTMAS .</head>
    <head>( AS IT WAS PRESENTED AT COURT , 1616 . )</head>
     <l n="1">The Court being seated ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Enter CHRISTMAS , with two or three of the guard , attired in round hose , long stockings , a close doublet , a high-crowned hat , with a brooch , a long , thin beard , a truncheon , little ruffs , white shoes , his scarfs and garters tied cross , and his drum beaten before him .</p>
   <p>Why , gentlemen , do you know what you do ? ha ! would you have kept me out ? Christmas , old Christmas , Christmas of London , and Captain Christmas ? Pray you , let me be brought before my lord chamberlain , I 'll not be answered else : ‘ Tis merry in hall , when beards wag all : I have seen the time you have wish 'd for me for a merry Christmas ; and now you have me , they would not let me in : I must come another time ! a good jest , as if I could come more than once a year ! Why , I am no dangerous person , and so I told my friends of the guard . I am old Gregory Christmas still , and though I come out of Pope'shYpppHeNhead alley , as good a Protestant as any in my parish . The truth is , I have brought a Masque here , out o ’ the city , of my own making , and do present it by a set of my sons , that come out of the lanes of London , good dancing boys all . It was intended , I confess , for Curriers Hall ; but because the weather has been open , and the Livery were not at leisure to see it till a frost came , that they cannot work , I thought it convenient , with some little alterations , and the groom of the revels ’ hand to ‘ t , to fit it for a higher place ; which I have done , and though I say it , another manner of device than your New-Year'shYpppHeNnight . Bones o ’ bread , the king ! ( seeing King James . ) Son Rowland ! Son Clem ! be ready there in a trice : quick , boys !</p>
   <p>Enter his Sons and Daughters , ( ten in number ,) led in , in a string , by Cupid , who is attired in a flat cap , and a prentice 's coat , with wings at his shoulders .</p>
   <p>MISRULE , in a velvet cap , with a sprig , a short cloak , great yellow ruff , like a reveller , his torch-bearer bearing a rope , a cheese , and a basket .</p>
   <p>CAROL , a long tawny coat , with a red cap , and a flute at his girdle , his torch-bearer carrying a song-book open .</p>
   <p>MINCED-PIE , like a fine cook 's wife , drest neat ; her man carrying a pie , dish , and spoons .</p>
   <p>GAMBOL , like a tumbler , with a hoop and bells ; his torch-bearer armed with a colt-staff , and a binding cloth .</p>
   <p>POST AND PAIR , with a pair-royal of aces in his hat ; his garment all done over with pairs and purs ; his squire carrying a box , cards , and counters .</p>
   <p>NEW-YEAR'ShYpppHeNGIFT , in a blue coat , serving-man like , with an orange , and a sprig of rosemary gilt on his head , his hat full of brooches , with a collar of ginger-bread , his torch-bearer carrying a march-pane with a bottle of wine on either arm .</p>
   <p>MUMMING , in a masquing pied suit , with a vizard , his torch-bearer carrying the box , and ringing it .</p>
   <p>WASSEL , like a neat sempster and songster ; her page bearing a brown bowl , drest with ribands , and rosemary before her .</p>
   <p>OFFERING , in a short gown , with a porter 's staff in his hand , a wyth born before him , and a bason , by his torch-bearer .</p>
   <p>BABY-CAKE , drest like a boy , in a fine long coat , biggin-bib , muckender , and a little dagger ; his usher bearing a great cake , with a bean and a pease .</p>
   <p>They enter singing .</p>

   <p>Ven . Now , all the lords bless me ! where am I , trow ? where is Cupid ? “ Serve the king ! ” they may serve the cobbler well enough , some of ‘ em , for any courtesy they have , I wisse ; they have need o ’ mending : unrude people they are , your courtiers ; here was thrust upon thrust indeed : was it ever so hard to get in before , trow ?</p>
   <p>Chris . How now ? what 's the matter ?</p>
   <p>Ven . A place , forsooth , I do want a place : I would have a good place , to see my child act in before the king and queen 's majesties , God bless ‘ em ! to-night .</p>
   <p>Chris . Why , here is no place for you .</p>
   <p>Ven . Right , forsooth , I am Cupid 's mother , Cupid 's own mother , forsooth ; yes , forsooth : I dwell in Pudding-lane : ay , forsooth , he is prentice in Love-lane , with a bugle maker , that makes of your bobs , and bird-bolts for ladies .</p>
   <p>Chris . Good lady Venus of Pudding-lane , you must go out for all this .</p>
   <p>Ven . Yes , forsooth , I can sit anywhere , so I may see Cupid act : he is a pretty child , though I say it , that perhaps should not , you will say . I had him by my first husband ; he was a smith , forsooth , we dwelt in Do-little-lane then : he came a month before his time , and that may make him somewhat imperfect ; but I was a fishmonger 's daughter .</p>
   <p>Chris . No matter for your pedigree , your house : good Venus , will you depart ?</p>
   <p>Ven . Ay , forsooth , he 'll say his part , I warrant him , as well as e'er a play-boy of ‘ em all : I could have had money enough for him , an I would have been tempted , and have let him out by the week to the king 's players . Master Burbage has been about and about with me , and so has old master Hemings , too , they have need of him ; where is he , trow , ha ! I would fain see him — pray God they have given him some drink since he came .</p>
   <p>Chris . Are you ready , boys ? Strike up ! nothing will drown this noise but a drum : a'peace , yet ! I have not done . Sing ,—</p>
   <p>Now their intent is above to present —</p>
   <p>Car . Why , here be half of the properties forgotten , father .</p>
   <p>Offer . Post and Pair wants his pur-chops and his pur-dogs .</p>
   <p>Car . Have you ne'er a son at the groom porter 's , to beg or borrow a pair of cards quickly ?</p>
   <p>Gam . It shall not need ; here 's your son Cheater without , has cards in his pocket .</p>
   <p>Offer . Ods so ! speak to the guards to let him in , under the name of a property .</p>
   <p>Gam . And here 's New-Year'shYpppHeNGift has an orange and rosemary , but not a clove to stick i n't .</p>
   <p>New-Year . Why , let one go to the spicery .</p>
   <p>Chris . Fy , fy , fy ! it 's naught , it 's naught , boys .</p>
   <p>Ven . Why , I have cloves , if it be cloves you want . I have cloves in my purse : I never go without one in my mouth .</p>
   <p>Car . And Mumming has not his vizard , neither .</p>
   <p>Chris . No matter ! his own face shall serve , for a punishment , and ‘ tis bad enough ; has Wassel her bowl , and Minced-pie her spoons ?</p>
   <p>Offer . Ay , ay : but Misrule doth not like his suit : he says the players have sent him one too little , on purpose to disgrace him .</p>
   <p>Chris . Let him hold his peace , and his disgrace will be the less : what ! shall we proclaim where we were furnish 'd ? Mum ! mum ! a'peace ! be ready , good boys .</p>

    <head>A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Twas the night before Christmas , when all through the house</l>
     <l n="2">Not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse ;</l>
     <l n="3">The stockings were hung by the chimney with care ,</l>
     <l n="4">In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there .</l>
     <l n="5">The children were nestled all snug in their beds ,</l>
     <l n="6">While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads ;</l>
     <l n="7">And mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap</l>
     <l n="8">Had just settled our brains for a long winter 's nap ,</l>
     <l n="9">When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter ,</l>
     <l n="10">I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter .</l>
     <l n="11">Away to the window I flew like a flash ,</l>
     <l n="12">Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash ;</l>
     <l n="13">The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow</l>
     <l n="14">Gave the lustre of day to the objects below ;</l>
     <l n="15">When what to my wondering eyes should appear</l>
     <l n="16">But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer ,</l>
     <l n="17">With a little old driver so lively and quick</l>
     <l n="18">I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick .</l>
     <l n="19">More rapid than eagles , his coursers they came ,</l>
     <l n="20">And he whistled and shouted and called them by name :</l>
     <l n="21">“ Now , Dasher ! now , Dancer ! now , Prancer ! now , Vixen !</l>
     <l n="22">On , Comet ! on , Cupid ! on , Dunder and Blixen !</l>
     <l n="23">To the top of the stoop , to the top of the wall !</l>
     <l n="24">Now dash away ! dash away ! dash away all ! ”</l>
     <l n="25">As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly ,</l>
     <l n="26">When they meet with an obstacle , mount to the sky ,</l>
     <l n="27">So up to the house-top the coursers they flew ,</l>
     <l n="28">With the sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too ;</l>
     <l n="29">And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof</l>
     <l n="30">The prancing and pawing of each little hoof .</l>
     <l n="31">As I drew in my head and was turning around ,</l>
     <l n="32">Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound ;</l>
     <l n="33">He was dressed all in furs from his head to his foot ,</l>
     <l n="34">And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot .</l>
     <l n="35">A bundle of toys he had flung on his back ;</l>
     <l n="36">And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack .</l>
     <l n="37">His eyes , how they twinkled ! his dimples , how merry !</l>
     <l n="38">His cheeks were like roses , his nose like a cherry ;</l>
     <l n="39">His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow .</l>
     <l n="41">The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth ,</l>
     <l n="42">And the smoke , it encircled his head like a wreath .</l>
     <l n="43">He had a broad face , and a little round belly</l>
     <l n="44">That shook when he laughed , like a bowl full of jelly .</l>
     <l n="45">He was chubby and plump , a right jolly old elf ,</l>
     <l n="46">And I laughed when I saw him , in spite of myself .</l>
     <l n="47">A wink of his eye and a twist of his head</l>
     <l n="48">Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread .</l>
     <l n="49">He spoke not a word , but went straight to his work ,</l>
     <l n="50">And filled all the stockings , then turned with a jerk ,</l>
     <l n="51">And laying his finger aside of his nose ,</l>
     <l n="52">And giving a nod , up the chimney he rose .</l>
     <l n="53">He sprang to his sleigh , to his team gave a whistle ,</l>
     <l n="54">And away they all flew like the down of a thistle ;</l>
     <l n="55">But I heard him exclaim , ere he drove out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="56">“ Happy Christmas to all , and to all a good-night ! ”</l>

     <l n="1">Meantime the village rouses up the fire :</l>
     <l n="2">While well attested , and as well believed ,</l>
     <l n="3">Heard solemn , goes the goblin story round ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till superstitious horror creeps o'er all .</l>
     <l n="5">Or , frequent in the sounding hall , they wake</l>
     <l n="6">The rural gambol . Rustic mirth goes round ;</l>
     <l n="7">The simple joke that takes the shepherd 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="8">Easily pleased ; the long , loud laugh , sincere ;</l>
     <l n="9">The kiss , snatched hasty from the side-long maid ,</l>
     <l n="10">On purpose guardless , or pretending sleep ;</l>
     <l n="11">The leap , the slap , the haul ; and , shook to notes</l>
     <l n="12">Of native music , the respondent dance ,</l>
     <l n="13">Thus jocund fleets with them the winter-night .</l>

    <head>CHRISTMAS WEATHER IN SCOTLAND .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A winter day ! the feather-silent snow</l>
     <l n="2">Thickens the air with strange delight , and lays</l>
     <l n="3">A fairy carpet on the barren lea .</l>
     <l n="4">No sun , yet all around that inward light</l>
     <l n="5">Which is in purity ,— a soft moonshine ,</l>
     <l n="6">The silvery dimness of a happy dream .</l>
     <l n="7">How beautiful ! afar on moorland ways ,</l>
     <l n="8">Bosomed by mountains , darkened by huge glens ,</l>
     <l n="9">( Where the lone altar raised by Druid hands</l>
     <l n="10">Stands like a mournful phantom ,) hidden clouds</l>
     <l n="11">Let fall soft beauty , till each green fir branch</l>
     <l n="12">Is plumed and tasselled , till each heather stalk</l>
     <l n="13">Is delicately fringed . The sycamores ,</l>
     <l n="14">Through all their mystical entanglement</l>
     <l n="15">Of boughs , are draped with silver . All the green</l>
     <l n="16">Of sweet leaves playing with the subtle air</l>
     <l n="17">In dainty murmuring ; the obstinate drone</l>
     <l n="18">Of limber bees that in the monk'shYpppHeNhood bells</l>
     <l n="19">House diligent ; the imperishable glow</l>
     <l n="20">Of summer sunshine never more confessed</l>
     <l n="21">The harmony of nature , the divine ,</l>
     <l n="22">Diffusive spirit of the beautiful .</l>
     <l n="23">Out in the snowy dimness , half revealed</l>
     <l n="24">Like ghosts in glimpsing moonshine , wildly run</l>
     <l n="25">The children in bewildering delight .</l>
     <l n="26">There is a living glory in the air ,—</l>
     <l n="27">A glory in the hushed air , in the soul</l>
     <l n="28">A palpitating wonder hushed in awe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="29">Softly — with delicate softness — as the light</l>
     <l n="30">Quickens in the undawned east ; and silently —</l>
     <l n="31">With definite silence — as the stealing dawn</l>
     <l n="32">Dapples the floating clouds , slow fall , slow fall ,</l>
     <l n="33">With indecisive motion eddying down ,</l>
     <l n="34">The white-winged flakes ,— calm as the sleep of sound ,</l>
     <l n="35">Dim as a dream . The silver-misted air</l>
     <l n="36">Shines with mild radiance , as when through a cloud</l>
     <l n="37">Of semilucent vapor shines the moon .</l>
     <l n="38">I saw last evening ( when the ruddy sun ,</l>
     <l n="39">Enlarged and strange , sank low and visibly ,</l>
     <l n="40">Spreading fierce orange o'er the west ) a scene</l>
     <l n="41">Of winter in his milder mood . Green fields ,</l>
     <l n="42">Which no kine cropped , lay damp ; and naked trees</l>
     <l n="43">Threw skeleton shadows . Hedges , thickly grown ,</l>
     <l n="44">Twined into compact firmness , with no leaves ,</l>
     <l n="45">Trembled in jewelled fretwork as the sun</l>
     <l n="46">To lustre touched the tremulous water-drops .</l>
     <l n="47">Alone , nor whistling as his fellows do</l>
     <l n="48">In fabling poem and provincial song ,</l>
     <l n="49">The ploughboy shouted to his reeking train ;</l>
     <l n="50">And at the clamor , from a neighboring field</l>
     <l n="51">Arose , with whirr of wings , a flock of rooks</l>
     <l n="52">More clamorous ; and through the frosted air ,</l>
     <l n="53">Blown wildly here and there without a law ,</l>
     <l n="54">They flew , low-grumbling out loquacious croaks .</l>
     <l n="55">Red sunset brightened all things ; streams ran red</l>
     <l n="56">Yet coldly ; and before the unwholesome east ,</l>
     <l n="57">Searching the bones and breathing ice , blew down</l>
     <l n="58">The hill , with a dry whistle , by the fire</l>
     <l n="59">In chamber twilight rested I at home .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="60">But now what revelation of fair change ,</l>
     <l n="61">O Giver of the seasons and the days !</l>
     <l n="62">Creator of all elements , pale mists ,</l>
     <l n="63">Invisible great winds and exact frost !</l>
     <l n="64">How shall I speak the wonder of thy snow ?</l>
     <l n="65">What though we know its essence and its birth ,</l>
     <l n="66">Can quick expound , in philosophic wise ,</l>
     <l n="67">The how , and whence , and manner of its fall ;</l>
     <l n="68">Yet , oh , the inner beauty and the life —</l>
     <l n="69">The life that is in snow ! The virgin-soft</l>
     <l n="70">And utter purity of the down-flake ,</l>
     <l n="71">Falling upon its fellow with no sound !</l>
     <l n="72">Unblown by vulgar winds , innumerous flakes</l>
     <l n="73">Fall gently , with the gentleness of love !</l>
     <l n="74">The earth is cherished , for beneath the soft ,</l>
     <l n="75">Pure uniformity is gently born</l>
     <l n="76">Warmth and rich mildness , fitting the dead roots</l>
     <l n="77">For the resuscitation of the spring .</l>
     <l n="78">Now while I write , the wonder clothes the vale ,</l>
     <l n="79">Calmed every wind and loaded every grove ;</l>
     <l n="80">And looking through the implicated boughs</l>
     <l n="81">I see a gleaming radiance . Sparkling snow ,</l>
     <l n="82">Refined by morning-footed frost so still ,</l>
     <l n="83">Mantles each bough ; and such a windless hush</l>
     <l n="84">Breathes through the air , it seems the fairy glen</l>
     <l n="85">About some phantom palace , pale abode</l>
     <l n="86">Of fabled Sleeping Beauty . Songless birds</l>
     <l n="87">Flit restlessly about the breathless wood ,</l>
     <l n="88">Waiting the sudden breaking of the charm ;</l>
     <l n="89">And as they quickly spring on nimble wing</l>
     <l n="90">From the white twig , a sparkling shower falls</l>
     <l n="91">Starlike . It is not whiteness , but a clear</l>
     <l n="92">Outshining of all purity , which takes</l>
     <l n="93">The winking eyes with such a silvery gleam .</l>
     <l n="94">No sunshine , and the sky is all one cloud .</l>
     <l n="95">The vale seems lonely , ghostlike ; while aloud</l>
     <l n="96">The housewife 's voice is heard with doubled sound .</l>
     <l n="97">I have not words to speak the perfect show ;</l>
     <l n="98">The ravishment of beauty ; the delight</l>
     <l n="99">Of silent purity ; the sanctity</l>
     <l n="100">Of inspiration which o'erflows the world ,</l>
     <l n="101">Making it breathless with divinity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="102">So thus with fair delapsion softly falls</l>
     <l n="103">The sacred shower ; and when the shortened day</l>
     <l n="104">Dejected dies in the low streaky west ,</l>
     <l n="105">The rising moon displays a cold blue night ,</l>
     <l n="106">And keen as steel the east wind sprinkles ice .</l>
     <l n="107">Thicker than bees , about the waxing moon</l>
     <l n="108">Gather the punctual stars . Huge whitened hills</l>
     <l n="109">Rise glimmering to the blue verge of the night ,</l>
     <l n="110">Ghostlike , and striped with narrow glens of firs</l>
     <l n="111">Black-waving , solemn . O'er the Luggie-stream</l>
     <l n="112">Gathers a veiny film of ice , and creeps</l>
     <l n="113">With elfin feet around each stone and reed ,</l>
     <l n="114">Working fine masonry ; while o'er the dam ,</l>
     <l n="115">Dashing , a noise of waters fills the clear</l>
     <l n="116">And nitrous air . All the dark , wintry hours</l>
     <l n="117">Sharply the winds from the white level moors</l>
     <l n="118">Keen whistle . Timorous in his homely bed</l>
     <l n="119">The school-boy listens , fearful lest gaunt wolves</l>
     <l n="120">Or beasts , whose uncouth forms in ancient books</l>
     <l n="121">He has beheld , at creaking shutters pull</l>
     <l n="122">Howling . And when at last the languid dawn</l>
     <l n="123">In wind redness re-illumines the east</l>
     <l n="124">With ineffectual fire , an intense blue</l>
     <l n="125">Severely vivid o'er the snowy hills</l>
     <l n="126">Gleams chill , while hazy , half-transparent clouds</l>
     <l n="127">Slow-range the freezing ether of the west .</l>
     <l n="128">Along the woods the keenly vehement blasts</l>
     <l n="129">Wail , and disrobe the mantled boughs , and fling</l>
     <l n="130">A snow-dust everywhere . Thus wears the day :</l>
     <l n="131">While grandfather over the well-watched fire</l>
     <l n="132">Hangs cowering , with a cold drop at his nose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="133">Now underneath the ice the Luggie growls ,</l>
     <l n="134">And to the polished smoothness curlers come</l>
     <l n="135">Rudely ambitious . Then for happy hours</l>
     <l n="136">The clinking stones are slid from wary hands ,</l>
     <l n="137">And Barleycorn , best wine for surly airs ,</l>
     <l n="138">Bites i ’ th ’ mouth , and ancient jokes are cracked .</l>
     <l n="139">And oh , the journey homeward , when the sun ,</l>
     <l n="140">Low-rounding to the west , in ruddy glow</l>
     <l n="141">Sinks large , and all the amber-skirted clouds ,</l>
     <l n="142">His flaming retinue , with dark'ning glow</l>
     <l n="143">Diverge ! The broom is brandished as the sign</l>
     <l n="144">Of conquest , and impetuously they boast</l>
     <l n="145">Of how this shot was played ,— with what a bend</l>
     <l n="146">Peculiar — the perfection of all art —</l>
     <l n="147">That stone came rolling grandly to the Tee</l>
     <l n="148">With victory crowned , and flinging wide the rest</l>
     <l n="149">In lordly crash ! Within the village inn</l>
     <l n="150">They by the roaring chimney sit , and quaff</l>
     <l n="151">The beaded Usqueba with sugar dashed .</l>
     <l n="152">O , when the precious liquid fires the brain</l>
     <l n="153">To joy , and every heart beats fast with mirth</l>
     <l n="154">And ancient fellowship , what nervy grasps</l>
     <l n="155">Of horny hands o'er tables of rough oak !</l>
     <l n="156">What singing of Lang Syne till tear-drops shine ,</l>
     <l n="157">And friendships brighten as the evening wanes !</l>
