    <docTitle><titlePart>AUTHOR 'S PREFACE With guilty , conscience-stricken tears , I offer up these rhymes of mine To children of maturer years ( From Seventeen to Ninety-nine ) . A special solace may they be In days of second infancy .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The frenzied mother who observes This volume in her offspring 's hand , And trembles for the darling 's nerves , Must please to clearly understand , If baby suffers by and by The Publisher 's at fault , not I ! But should the little brat survive , And fatten on this style of Rhyme , To raise a Heartless Home and thrive Through a successful life of crime , The Publisher would have you see That I am to be thanked , not he ! Fond parent , you whose children are Of tender age ( from two to eight ) , Pray keep this little volume far From reach of such , and relegate My verses to an upper shelf ; Where you may study them yourself .</docImprint>
   </titlePage>
   <div type="introduction">
    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="71">The Press may pass my Verses by With sentiments of indignation , And say , like Greeks of old , that I Corrupt the Youthful Generation ; I am unmoved by taunts like these — ( And so , I think , was Socrates ) .</p>
    <p n="72">Howe'er the Critics may revile , I pick no journalistic quarrels , Quite realising that my Style Makes up for any lack of Morals ; For which I feel no shred of shame — ( And Byron would have felt the same ) .</p>
    <p n="73">I do n't intend a Child to read These lines , which are not for the Young ; For , if I did , I should indeed Feel fully worthy to be hung . ( Is ‘ hanged ’ the perfect tense of ‘ hang ’ ? Correct me , Mr. Andrew Lang ! )</p>
    <p n="74">O Young of Heart , tho ’ in your prime , By you these verses may be seen ! Accept the Moral with the Rhyme , And try to gather what I mean . But , if you can n't , it wo n't hurt me ! ( And Browning would , I know , agree . )</p>
    <p n="75">Be reassured , I have not got The style of Stephen Phillips ’ heroes , Nor Henry Jones 's pow'r of Plot , Nor wit like Arthur Wing Pinero 's ! ( If so , I should not waste my time In writing you this sort of rhyme . )</p>
    <p n="76">I strive to paint things as they Are , Of Realism the true Apostle ; All flow'ry metaphors I bar , Nor call the homely thrush a ‘ throstle . ’ Such synonyms would make me smile . ( And so they would have made Carlyle . )</p>
    <p n="77">My Style may be , at times , I own , A trifle cryptic or abstruse ; In this I do not stand alone , And need but mention , in excuse , A thousand world-familiar names , From Meredith to Henry James .</p>
    <p n="78">From these my fruitless fancy roams To Aesop 's or La Fontaine 's Fable , From Doyle 's or Hemans ’ ‘ Stately Ho ( l ) mes , ’ To t'other of The Breakfast Table ; Like Galahad , I wish ( in vain ) ‘ My wit were as the wit of Twain !</p>
    <p n="79">Had I but Whitman 's rugged skill , ( And managed to escape the Censor ) , The Accuracy of a Mill , The Reason of a Herbert Spencer , The literary talents even Of Sidney Lee or Leslie Stephen ,</p>
    <p n="80">The pow'r of Patmore 's placid pen , Or Watson 's gift of execration , The sugar of Le Gallienne , Or Algernon 's alliteration , One post there is I 'd not be lost in , — Tho ’ I might find it most ex-Austin ’ !</p>
    <p n="81">Some day , if I but study hard , The public , vanquished by my pen , ‘ ll Acclaim me as a Minor Bard , Like Norman Gale or Mrs. Meynell ; And listen to my lyre a-rippling Imperial banjo-spasms like Kipling .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>Were I , like him , a syndicate , Which publishers would put their trust in ; A Walter Pater up-to-date , Or flippant scholar like Augustine ; With pen as light as lark or squirrel , I 'd love to kipple , pate and birrell . So do n't ignore me . If you should , ‘ Twill touch me to the very heart oh ! To be as much misunderstood As once was Andrea del Sarto ; Unrecognised , to toil away , Like Millet ,— ( not , of course , Millais ) .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>And , pray , for Morals do not look In this unique agglomeration , — This unpretentious little book Of Infelicitous Quotation . I deem you foolish if you do , ( And Mr. Arnold thinks so , too ) .</p>

    <head>THE LEGEND OF THE AUTHOR</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">( A long way after Ingoldsby )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">When Anthony Adamson first went to school</l>
     <l n="3">The reception he got was decidedly cool ;</l>
     <l n="4">And , because he was utterly hopeless at games ,</l>
     <l n="5">He was given all sorts of opprobrious names ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which ranged the whole gamut from ‘ fat-head ’ to ‘ fool ’ ;</l>
     <l n="7">For boys as a rule , Are what nurses call ‘ crool , ’</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis their natural instinct , which nobody blames ,</l>
     <l n="9">Any more than the habits Peculiar to rabbits ,</l>
     <l n="10">To label a duffer ‘ old woman ’ or ‘ muff , ’ or</l>
     <l n="11">Some name calculated to cause him to suffer .</l>
     <l n="12">They failed in their treatment this time , on the whole ,</l>
     <l n="13">Since our Anthony thoroughly pitied the role</l>
     <l n="14">Of the oaf who is muddied , ( For Kipling he 'd studied ) ,</l>
     <l n="15">However strong-hearted , broad-limbed , and warm-blooded ,</l>
     <l n="16">Who sits in a goal , Quite deficient of soul ,</l>
     <l n="17">And as blind to the beauties of Life as a mole .</l>
     <l n="18">He was rather a curious boy , was this youth ,</l>
     <l n="19">And a bit of a prig , if you must know the truth ,</l>
     <l n="20">And his comrades considered him weird and uncouth ,</l>
     <l n="21">For he did n't much mind When they left him behind ,</l>
     <l n="22">And , intent upon cricket , Went off to the wicket ;</l>
     <l n="23">Some other less heating employment he 'd find ,</l>
     <l n="24">And , while his young playfellows fielded and batted ,</l>
     <l n="25">This curious fat-head , Ink-fingered , hair-matted ,</l>
     <l n="26">Would take a new pen from his pocket , and lick it ,</l>
     <l n="27">Then into the ink-bottle thoughtfully stick it ,</l>
     <l n="28">And , chewing the holder ( ‘ Twas fashioned of gold ,</l>
     <l n="29">Or at least so ‘ twas sold By a stationer bold ,</l>
     <l n="30">And at any rate furnished a good imitation ) ,</l>
     <l n="31">In deep rumination , With much mastication ,</l>
     <l n="32">And wonderful patience , Await inspirations ;</l>
     <l n="33">And brilliant ideas would arrive on occasions ;</l>
     <l n="34">When frequently followed , The pen being swallowed ,</l>
     <l n="35">As up to his eyes in the inkpot he wallowed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="36">So all the day long and for half of the night</l>
     <l n="37">Would young Anthony Adamson nibble and write ,</l>
     <l n="38">With extravagant feelings of joy and delight ,</l>
     <l n="39">And it may sound absurd , But ‘ twas thus , as I 've heard ,</l>
     <l n="40">That he learnt to acquire the appropriate word ;</l>
     <l n="41">And altho ’ composition , Which was his ambition ,</l>
     <l n="42">At first proved a trifle untamed and refractory ;</l>
     <l n="43">Arrived in a while At evolving a style</l>
     <l n="44">Which a Stevenson even might deem satisfactory .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="45">Now when Anthony A. was as yet in his ‘ teens</l>
     <l n="46">He began to take aim at the big magazines ,</l>
     <l n="47">With articles , verses , and little love-scenes ;</l>
     <l n="48">And short stories he wrote , Which he sent with a note</l>
     <l n="49">( Which I have n't the space nor the leisure to quote ) ,</l>
     <l n="50">Containing a humble request , and a hope ,</l>
     <l n="51">And some stamps and a clearly addressed envelope .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="52">Now a few of these got to the Editor 's desk ,</l>
     <l n="53">And he found them well-written and quite picturesque ,</l>
     <l n="54">And he sighed to see talent like this go to waste</l>
     <l n="55">On what could n't appeal to the popular taste .</l>
     <l n="56">For the Public , you see ( With a capital P ) ,</l>
     <l n="57">Does n't care what it reads , just so long as it be</l>
     <l n="58">Something really exciting , however bad writing ,</l>
     <l n="59">With wonderful heroes , And villains like Neroes ,</l>
     <l n="60">Who , running as serials , Wearing imperials ,</l>
     <l n="61">Revel in bloodshed and bombast and fighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="62">So back to the Author his manuscript went ;</l>
     <l n="63">Altho ’ sometimes a friendly old Editor sent</l>
     <l n="64">An encouraging letter , To say he 'd do better</l>
     <l n="65">To lower his style to the popular level ;</l>
     <l n="66">When Anthony proudly ( Of course not out loudly ,</l>
     <l n="67">But mentally ) told him to go to the devil !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="68">But a few of his articles never came back ,</l>
     <l n="69">And their whereabouts no one was able to track ,</l>
     <l n="70">For some persons who edited , ( Can it be credited ? )</l>
     <l n="71">Finding it paid them , Unduly mislaid them</l>
     <l n="72">( Behaviour most rare Nowadays anywhere ,</l>
     <l n="73">And to ev'ry tradition entirely opposed ) ,</l>
     <l n="74">And grew fat on the numerous stamps he enclosed .</l>
     <l n="75">Tho ’ to this I am really unable to swear ,</l>
     <l n="76">Or at any rate have n't the courage to dare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="77">Now when Anthony Adamson grew rather older ,</l>
     <l n="78">And wiser , and bolder , And broader of shoulder ,</l>
     <l n="79">He thought he 'd a fancy to write for the Press ,—</l>
     <l n="80">‘ Tis a common idea with the young , more or less ;—</l>
     <l n="81">And he saw himself doing Critiques and reviewing</l>
     <l n="82">The latest new books as they came from the printers ;</l>
     <l n="83">To set them on thrones or to smash them to splinters ,</l>
     <l n="84">To damn with faint praise , Or with eulogies raise ,</l>
     <l n="85">As he banned or he blest , Just whatever seemed best</l>
     <l n="86">To the wit and the wisdom of twenty-three winters .</l>
     <l n="87">But when he had carefully read thro ’ the papers ,</l>
     <l n="88">Arranged to the taste of our nation of drapers ,</l>
     <l n="89">And wisely as Solomon Studied each column , an</l>
     <l n="90">Awful attack of despair and depression</l>
     <l n="91">Assailed him , and then , As he threw down his pen ,</l>
     <l n="92">He was forced to confess To no hope of success ,</l>
     <l n="93">If he entered the great journalistic profession .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="94">For the only description of ‘ copy ’ that pays ,</l>
     <l n="95">In the journals that ev'ry one reads nowadays ,</l>
     <l n="96">Is the personal matter , Impertinent chatter ,</l>
     <l n="97">The tales of the tailor , the barber , the hatter ;</l>
     <l n="98">Society small talk , And mere servants ’ - hall talk ,</l>
     <l n="99">The sort of what'shYpppHeNnobody ' s-business-at-all-talk ;</l>
     <l n="100">And those who can handle The latest big scandal</l>
     <l n="101">With the taste of a Thug and the tact of a Vandal ,</l>
     <l n="102">Whatever society paper they write in ,</l>
     <l n="103">Can always provide what their readers delight in .</l>
     <l n="104">An article , vulgarly written , which deals</l>
     <l n="105">With the food that celebrities eat at their meals</l>
     <l n="106">To the popular intellect always appeals .</l>
     <l n="107">People laugh themselves hoarse At the latest divorce ,</l>
     <l n="108">While a peer 's breach of promise is comic , of course ;</l>
     <l n="109">How eager each face is , As ev'ry one races</l>
     <l n="110">To read the details of the Cruelty cases !</l>
     <l n="111">And a magistrate 's pun Is considered good fun ,</l>
     <l n="112">And arouses the bench of reporters from torpor ,</l>
     <l n="113">When it 's at the expense of some broken-down pauper !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="114">So Anthony pondered the different ways</l>
     <l n="115">Of attaining and gaining the popular praise ;</l>
     <l n="116">And selected a score of his brightest essays ,</l>
     <l n="117">Just enough for a book , Which he hopefully took</l>
     <l n="118">To some publishers , thinking perhaps they would look</l>
     <l n="119">At what might ( as he could n't help modestly hinting )</l>
     <l n="120">Repay the expense and the trouble of printing .</l>
     <l n="121">Now the publishers all were extremely polite ,</l>
     <l n="122">And encouraging quite , For they saw he could write ;</l>
     <l n="123">But the answer they gave him was always the same .</l>
     <l n="124">‘ You are not , ’ so they said , ‘ in the least bit to blame ,</l>
     <l n="125">And your style is so good , Be it well understood ,</l>
     <l n="126">We 'd be happy to publish your work if we could ;</l>
     <l n="127">But alas ! All the people who know are agreed</l>
     <l n="128">This is not what the Public demands , or would read .</l>
     <l n="129">‘ It is over the head Of the people , ’ they said .</l>
     <l n="130">‘ If you 'd only write down to the popular level ! ’</l>
     <l n="131">( Once more , he replied , they could go to the devil ! )</l>
     <l n="132">The result to our author was not unexpected ,</l>
     <l n="133">And , as on his failures he sadly reflected ,</l>
     <l n="134">He took out his pen and a nib he selected ,</l>
     <l n="135">Then wrote ( and his verses Were studded with curses )</l>
     <l n="136">This poem , the Lay of the Author ( Rejected ) .</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Attracted to the frozen river 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where on a small impromptu snow-swept rink ,</l>
     <l n="4">The happy skaters darted left and right ,</l>
     <l n="5">Or circled amorously out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="6">Some self-supporting ; some , like falling stars ,</l>
     <l n="7">Spread-eagling ankle-weak parabolas ;</l>
     <l n="8">I watched the human swarm , and I was ‘ ware</l>
     <l n="9">A woman , disarranged , knelt on a chair .</l>
     <l n="10">She had cold feet on which she could not run ,</l>
     <l n="11">And piteously she thawed them in the sun .</l>
     <l n="12">Those feet were of a woman that alone</l>
     <l n="13">Was kneeling ; a pink liquid by her shone ,</l>
     <l n="14">Which raising to her luminous , lantern jaw ,</l>
     <l n="15">She sipped ; or idly stirred it with a straw .</l>
     <l n="16">Upon her hat she wore a kind of fowl ,</l>
     <l n="17">An hummingbird , I ween , or else an owl .</l>
     <l n="18">Then turned to me . I looked the other way ,</l>
     <l n="19">Trembling ; I knew the words she wished to say .</l>
     <l n="20">So warm her gaze the blood rushed to my head ,</l>
     <l n="21">Instinctively I knew her feet were dead .</l>
     <l n="22">Amorphous feet , like monumental moons ,</l>
     <l n="23">Pavement-obliterating , vast , pontoons ,</l>
     <l n="24">Superbly varnished , to the ice had come ,</l>
     <l n="25">And now , snow-kissed , frost-fettered , dangled numb .</l>
     <l n="26">Gently she spoke ,— the while my senses whirled ,</l>
     <l n="27">Of ‘ largest circulations in the world ’ ;</l>
     <l n="28">Wildly she spoke , as babble men in dreams ,</l>
     <l n="29">Of feeling life 's blood ‘ rushing to extremes ’ ;</l>
     <l n="30">But I ignored her with deliberate stare ,</l>
     <l n="31">Until the indelicate thing began to swear .</l>
     <l n="32">Sensations as of pins and needles rose ,</l>
     <l n="33">Apollinaris-like , in tingled toes .</l>
     <l n="34">She felt the hungry frost that punctured holes ,</l>
     <l n="35">Like concentrated seidlitz , in her soles .</l>
     <l n="36">Feebly she stept ; and sudden was aware</l>
     <l n="37">Her feet had gone ,— they were no longer there ,—</l>
     <l n="38">And from her boots was willing to be freed ;</l>
     <l n="39">She would not keep what she could never need .</l>
     <l n="40">Sullenly I consented , and withdrew</l>
     <l n="41">From either heel a huge chaotic shoe ;</l>
     <l n="42">Yet for a time laboriously and slow</l>
     <l n="43">She journeyed with her ponderous boots , as though</l>
     <l n="44">Along with her she could not help but bear</l>
     <l n="45">The bargelike burdens she was wont to wear .</l>
     <l n="46">Towards me she reeled ; and ‘ Oh ! my Uncle , ’ cried ,</l>
     <l n="47">‘ My Uncle ! ’ but I pushed her to one side ,</l>
     <l n="48">Then smiled upon her so she could not stay ,—</l>
     <l n="49">( My smile can frighten motor-cars away ):—</l>
     <l n="50">While thus I grinned , not knowing what to do ,</l>
     <l n="51">A belted beadle , in immaculate blue ,</l>
     <l n="52">Plucked at my sleeve , and shattered my romance ,</l>
     <l n="53">Wheeling on cushion tires an ambulance .</l>
     <l n="54">Deliberately then he laid her there ,</l>
     <l n="55">Tucked in and bore away ; I did not care !</l>

     <l n="2">The train came early in to-night ,</l>
     <l n="3">The sullen guard was soon awake ,</l>
     <l n="4">And threw my luggage down , for spite ,</l>
     <l n="5">To where the platform seemed a lake ;</l>
     <l n="6">And did his best my box to break .</l>
     <l n="7">When sidled up a porter ; straight ,</l>
     <l n="8">He mopped the platform with a broom ,</l>
     <l n="9">And , kneeling , made the well-filled grate</l>
     <l n="10">Blaze up within the waiting-room ,</l>
     <l n="11">And so dispelled the usual gloom .</l>
     <l n="12">Which done , he came and took his seat</l>
     <l n="13">Beside me , doffed his coat , untied</l>
     <l n="14">His bootlaces , and let his feet</l>
     <l n="15">Peep coyly out on either side ;</l>
     <l n="16">Then called me . When no voice replied ,</l>
     <l n="17">He rolled his shirt-sleeve up , and rose ,</l>
     <l n="18">And laid his brawny biceps bare ,</l>
     <l n="19">And , where my eyebrows meet my nose ,</l>
     <l n="20">He slowly shook his fist , just there ,</l>
     <l n="21">And seized me by my yellow hair .</l>
     <l n="22">Then roughly asked me , had I got</l>
     <l n="23">A head as empty as a bubble ?</l>
     <l n="24">Bidding me sternly , did I not</l>
     <l n="25">Desire henceforth to see things double ,</l>
     <l n="26">To give him something for his trouble .</l>
     <l n="27">Nor could my arguments prevail ;</l>
     <l n="28">Entreaties , threats were all in vain !</l>
     <l n="29">Returned he to the twice-told tale</l>
     <l n="30">Of how , from out the midnight train ,</l>
     <l n="31">He bore my luggage through the rain .</l>
     <l n="32">I fixed him with my cold grey eye ,</l>
     <l n="33">But all in vain ; at last I knew</l>
     <l n="34">That porter hated me ; ( though why</l>
     <l n="35">I cannot understand , can you ? )</l>
     <l n="36">And what on earth was I to do !</l>
     <l n="37">Next moment , though I still perspire</l>
     <l n="38">To think of it , I quickly found</l>
     <l n="39">A thing to do ; and on the fire</l>
     <l n="40">I pushed him backwards with a bound ,</l>
     <l n="41">And piled the coal up all around .</l>
     <l n="42">Cremated him . No pain he felt .</l>
     <l n="43">As a shut coop that holds a hen ,</l>
     <l n="44">I oped the register and smelt</l>
     <l n="45">An odour as of burnt quill-pen .</l>
     <l n="46">My laughter bubbled over then .</l>
     <l n="47">I seized him lightly , with the tongs</l>
     <l n="48">About his waist ; and through the door</l>
     <l n="49">I bore him , burning with my wrongs ,</l>
     <l n="50">And laid him on the line . What 's more ,</l>

So far as we are aware , only one balladist has found any genuine inspiration in it . That is Mr. Harry Graham , whose skill as a rhymer in other directions has already been abundantly proved . The ballads for the most part take a colloquial form , and while containing much humour , are full of sound doctrine .... Mr. Graham , it will be seen , has great facility in rhyme , and in all this rhyme there is reason . When the General Election comes this book should be a gold-mine for the political reciter . ’ — Westminster Gazette . ‘ A most amusing contribution to the literature of the fiscal controversy . ’ — Daily Telegraph . ‘ True ballads , with abundant vigour and piquancy . ’ — Aberdeen Free Press . ‘ Good both in intention and execution . ’ — Speaker . ‘ These ballads ... are very good . Indeed , we cannot remember any recent example of political truths expressed with such exactness as well as spirit in humorous verse . The fun is as good as the argument .... Of this admirable little book we will only say , in conclusion , that it will amuse and delight even those who had imagined that nothing more worth reading could possibly be printed on the fiscal question . We would strongly urge such persons to invest a shilling in “ Fiscal Ballads , ” for we are confident they will not be disappointed .

LONDON : GAY AND BIRD , 22 BEDFORD STREET , STRAND . SELECTIONS FROM MR. EDWARD ARNOLD 'S LIST OF NEW AND RECENT BOOKS . THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE RIGHT HON . CECIL JOHN RHODES . By the HON . SIR LEWIS MICHELL . Illustrated . Two volumes , demy 8vo ., 30s . net . This important work will take rank as the authoritative biography of one of the greatest of modern Englishmen . Sir Lewis Michell , who has been engaged upon the work for five years , is an executor of Mr. Rhodes ’ will , and a trustee of the Rhodes Estate . He was an intimate personal friend of Mr. Rhodes for many years , and has had access to all the papers at Groote Schuur . Hitherto , although many partial appreciations of the great man have been published in the Press or in small volumes , no complete and well-informed life of him has appeared . The gap has now been filled by Sir Lewis Michell so thoroughly that we have in these two volumes what will undoubtedly be the final estimate of Mr. Rhodes ’ career for many years to come . THE REMINISCENCES OF ADMIRAL MONTAGU . With Illustrations . One volume , demy 8vo ., cloth , 15s . net . The Author of this entertaining book , Admiral the Hon . Victor Montagu , has passed a long life divided between the amusements of aristocratic society in this country and the duties of naval service afloat in many parts of the world . His memory recalls many anecdotes of well-known men , and he was honoured with the personal friendship of the late King Edward VII . and of the German Emperor , by whom his seamanship , as well as his social qualities , were highly esteemed . As a sportsman he has something to say about shooting , fishing , hunting , and cricket , and his stories of life in the great country houses where he was a frequent guest have a flavour of their own . LONDON : EDWARD ARNOLD , 41 &amp; 43 , MADDOX STREET , W. NOVELS . HOWARDS END . By E. M. FORSTER , AUTHOR OF ‘ A ROOM WITH A VIEW , ’ ‘ THE LONGEST JOURNEY , ’ ETC . 6s . BY THE SAME AUTHOR . A ROOM WITH A VIEW . 6s . THE RETURN . By WALTER DE LA MARE . 6s . ‘ The Return ’ is the story of a man suddenly confronted , as if by the caprice of chance , with an ordeal that cuts him adrift from every certain hold he has upon the world immediately around him . He becomes acutely conscious of those unseen powers which to many , whether in reality or in imagination , are at all times vaguely present , haunting life with their influences . In this solitude — a solitude of the mind which the business of everyday life confuses and drives back — he faces as best he can , and gropes his way through his difficulties , and wins his way at last , if not to peace , at least to a clearer and quieter knowledge of self . THE GRAY MAN . By JANE WARDLE . 6s . The writer is one of the very few present-day novelists who have consistently followed up the aim they originally set themselves — that of striking a mean between the Realist and the Romanticist . In her latest novel , ‘ The Gray Man , ’ which Miss Wardle herself believes to contain the best work she has so far produced , it will be found that she has as successfully avoided the bald one-sidedness of miscalled ‘ Realism ’ on the one hand , as the sloppy sentimentality of the ordinary ‘ Romance ’ on the other . At the same time , ‘ The Gray Man ’ contains both realism and romance in full measure , in the truer sense of both words . BY THE SAME AUTHOR . MARGERY PIGEON . 6s . THE PASQUE FLOWER . 6s . LONDON : EDWARD ARNOLD , 41 &amp; 43 , MADDOX STREET , W. NOVELS . THE PURSUIT . By FRANK SAVILE . 6s . That the risk of being kidnapped , to which their great riches exposes multi-millionaires , is a very real one , is constantly being reaffirmed in the reports that are published of the elaborate precautions many of them take to preserve their personal liberty . In its present phase , where there is the great wealth on one side and a powerful gang — or rather syndicate — of clever rascals on the other , it possesses many characteristics appealing to those who enjoy a good thrilling romance . Mr. Savile has already won his spurs in this field , but his new tale should place him well in the front ranks of contemporary romancers . BY THE SAME AUTHOR . SEEKERS .

AN ADMIRABLE NOVEL BY A NEW WRITER . A STEPSON OF THE SOIL . By MARY J. H. SKRINE . Second Impression . 6s . ‘ Mrs. Skrine 's admirable novel is one of those unfortunately rare books which , without extenuating the hard facts of life , maintain and raise one 's belief in human nature . The story is simple , but the manner of its telling is admirably uncommon . Her portraits are quite extraordinarily vivid . ’ — Spectator . LONDON : EDWARD ARNOLD , 41 &amp; 43 , MADDOX STREET , W. BOOKS ON COUNTRY LIFE . FLY-LEAVES FROM A FISHERMAN 'S DIARY . By CAPTAIN G. E. SHARP . With Photogravure Illustrations . Crown 8vo ., 5s . net . This is a very charming little book containing the reflections on things piscatorial of a ‘ dry-fly ’ fisherman on a south country stream . Although the Author disclaims any right to pose as an expert , it is clear that he knows well his trout , and how to catch them . He is an enthusiast , who thinks nothing of cycling fifteen miles out for an evening 's fishing , and home again when the ‘ rise ’ is over . Indeed , he confesses that there is no sport he loves so passionately , and this love of his art — surely dry-fly fishing is an art ?— makes for writing that is pleasant to read , even as Isaac Walton 's love thereof inspired the immortal pages of ‘ The Compleat Angler . ’ MEMORIES OF THE MONTHS . By the RIGHT HON . SIR HERBERT MAXWELL , Bart ., AUTHOR OF ‘ SCOTTISH GARDENS , ’ ETC . SERIES I. to V. With Photogravure Illustrations . Large crown 8vo ., 7s . 6d . each . Every year brings new changes in the old order of Nature , and the observant eye can always find fresh features on the face of the Seasons . Sir Herbert Maxwell goes out to meet Nature on the moor and loch , in garden and forest , and writes of what he sees and feels . This is what gives his work its abiding charm , and makes these memories fill the place of old friends on the library bookshelf . COLONEL MEYSEY-THOMPSON 'S HANDBOOKS . A HUNTING CATECHISM .

A SHOOTING CATECHISM . 3s . 6d . net . LONDON : EDWARD ARNOLD , 41 &amp; 43 , MADDOX STREET , W. A GAMEKEEPER 'S NOTE-BOOK . By OWEN JONES and MARCUS WOODWARD . With Photogravure Illustrations . Large crown 8vo ., cloth , 7s . 6d . net . In this charming and romantic book we follow the gamekeeper in his secret paths , stand by him while with deft fingers he arranges his traps and snares , watch with what infinite care he tends his young game through all the long days of spring and summer — and in autumn and winter garners with equal eagerness the fruits of his labour . He takes us into the coverts at night , and with him we keep the long vigil — while poachers come , or come not . The authors know their subject through and through . This is a real series of studies from life , and the note-book from which all the impressions are drawn and all the pictures painted is the real note-book of a real gamekeeper . TEN YEARS OF GAME-KEEPING . By OWEN JONES . With numerous Illustrations from Photographs by the Author . One volume , demy 8vo ., cloth , 10s . 6d . net . ‘ This is a book for all sportsmen , for all who take an interest in sport , and for all who love the English woodlands . Mr. Jones writes from triple view-points — those of sportsman , naturalist , and gamekeeper — and every page of his book reveals an intimate knowledge of the ways of the English wild , a perfect mastery of all that the word “ woodcraft ” may stand for , and a true instinct of sportsmanship . This book at once takes its place as a standard work ; and its freshness will endure as surely as spring comes to the woods that inspired it . ’ — Evening Standard .

A BOOK ABOUT THE GARDEN AND THE GARDENER . By the late Very Rev . S. REYNOLDS HOLE , Dean of Rochester . Popular Edition . Crown 8vo ., 3s . 6d . LONDON : EDWARD ARNOLD , 41 &amp; 43 , MADDOX STREET , W. BOOKS OF TRAVEL . FOREST LIFE AND SPORT IN INDIA . By SAINTHILL EARDLEY-WILMOT , C. I. E ., lately Inspector-General of Forests to the Indian Government ; Commissioner under the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act . Fully Illustrated . Demy 8vo . 12s . 6d . net . The Author of this volume was appointed to the Indian Forest Service in days when the Indian Mutiny was fresh in the minds of his companions , and life in the department full of hardships , loneliness , and discomfort . These drawbacks , however , were largely compensated for by the splendid opportunities for sports of all kinds which almost every station in the Service offered , and it is in describing the pursuit of game that the most exciting episodes of the book are to be found . Tigers , spotted deer , wild buffaloes , mountain goats , sambhar , bears , and panthers , are the subject of endless yarns , in the relation of which innumerable useful hints , often the result of failure and even disasters , are given . IN FORBIDDEN SEAS : Recollections of Sea-Otter Hunting in the Kurils . By H. J . SNOW , F. R. G. S . Illustrated . Demy 8vo . 12s . 6d . net . The Author of this interesting book has had an experience probably unique in an almost unknown part of the world . The stormy wind-swept and fog-bound regions of the Kuril Islands , between Japan and Kamchatka , have rarely been visited save by the adventurous hunters of the sea-otter , and the animal is now becoming so scarce that the hazardous occupation of these bold voyagers is no longer profitable . SPORT AND NATURE IN SPAIN . By ABEL CHAPMAN and WALTER J. BUCK , British Vice-Consul at Jerez . With 200 Illustrations by the AUTHORS , E. CALDWELL , and others , Sketch Maps , and Photographs . In Europe Spain is certainly far and away the wildest of wild lands — due as much to her physical formation as to any historic or racial causes . Naturally the Spanish fauna remains one of the richest and most varied in Europe . It is of these wild regions and of their wild inhabitants that the authors write , backed by lifelong experience . The present work represents nearly forty years of constant study , of practical experience in field and forest , combined with systematic note-taking and analysis by men who are recognized as specialists in their selected pursuits . These comprise every branch of sport with rod , gun , and rifle ; and , beyond all that , the ability to elaborate the results in the light of modern zoological science . LONDON : EDWARD ARNOLD , 41 &amp; 43 , MADDOX STREET , W. TWENTY YEARS IN THE HIMALAYA . By Major the Hon . C. G. BRUCE , M. V. O ., Fifth Gurkha Rifles . Fully Illustrated . With Map . Demy 8vo ., cloth . 16s . net . The Himalaya is a world in itself , comprising many regions which differ widely from each other as regards their natural features , their fauna and flora , and the races and languages of their inhabitants . Major Bruce 's relation to this world is absolutely unique — he has journeyed through it , now in one part , now in another , sometimes mountaineering , sometimes in pursuit of big game , sometimes in the performance of his professional duties , for more than twenty years ; and now his acquaintance with it under all its diverse aspects , though naturally far from complete , is more varied and extensive than has ever been possessed by anyone else . RECOLLECTIONS OF AN OLD MOUNTAINEER . By WALTER LARDEN . Fully Illustrated . Demy 8vo ., cloth . 14s . net . There are a few men in every generation , such as A. F. Mummery and L. Norman Neruda , who possess a natural genius for mountaineering . The ordinary lover of the mountains reads the story of their climbs with admiration and perhaps a tinge of envy , but with no thought of following in their footsteps — such feats are not for him . The great and special interest of Mr. Larden 's book lies in the fact that he does not belong to this small and distinguished class . He tells us , and convinces us , that he began his Alpine career with no exceptional endowment of nerve or activity , and describes , fully and with supreme candour , how he made himself into what he very modestly calls a second-class climber — not ‘ a Grepon-crack man , ’ but one capable of securely and successfully leading a party of amateurs over such peaks as Mont Collon or the Combin . THE MISADVENTURES OF A HACK CRUISER . By F. CLAUDE KEMPSON , Author of ‘ The Green Finch Cruise . ’ With 50 Illustrations from the Author 's sketches . Medium 8vo ., cloth . 6s . net . Mr. Kempson 's amusing account of ‘ The Green Finch Cruise , ’ which was published last year , gave deep delight to the joyous fraternity of amateur sailor-men , and the success that book enjoyed has encouraged him to describe a rather more ambitious cruise he undertook subsequently . Mr. Kempson is not an expert , but he shows how anyone accustomed to a sportsman 's life can , with a little instruction and common sense , have a thoroughly enjoyable time sailing a small boat . The book is full of ‘ tips and wrinkles ’ of all kinds , interspersed with amusing anecdotes and reflections . The Author 's sketches are exquisitely humorous , and never more so than when he is depicting his own substantial person . LONDON : EDWARD ARNOLD , 41 &amp; 43 , MADDOX STREET , W.
