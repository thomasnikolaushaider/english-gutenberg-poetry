    <p n="1">This poem , though new in the sense of being now for the first time printed , was written some four years ago , about the same date as the Hound of Heaven in my former volume .</p>
    <p n="2">One image in the Proem was an unconscious plagiarism from the beautiful image in Mr. Patmore 's St. Valentine 's Day : -</p>

     <p>“ O baby Spring , That flutter'st sudden ‘ neath the breast of Earth , A month before the birth ! ” Finding I could not disengage it without injury to the passage in which it is embedded , I have preferred to leave it , with this acknowledgment to a Poet rich enough to lend to the poor .</p>

    <head>THE PROEM</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Shrewd winds and shrill — were these the speech of May ?</l>
     <l n="2">A ragged , slag-grey sky — invested so ,</l>
     <l n="3">Mary 's spoilt nursling ! wert thou wont to go ?</l>
     <l n="4">Or THOU , Sun-god and song-god , say</l>
     <l n="5">Could singer pipe one tiniest linnet-lay ,</l>
     <l n="6">While Song did turn away his face from song ?</l>
     <l n="7">Or who could be</l>
     <l n="8">In spirit or in body hale for long , -</l>
     <l n="9">Old AEsculap 's best Master !— lacking thee ?</l>
     <l n="10">At length , then , thou art here !</l>
     <l n="11">On the earth 's lethed ear</l>
     <l n="12">Thy voice of light rings out exultant , strong ;</l>
     <l n="13">Through dreams she stirs and murmurs at that summons dear :</l>
     <l n="14">From its red leash my heart strains tamelessly ,</l>
     <l n="15">For Spring leaps in the womb of the young year !</l>
     <l n="16">Nay , was it not brought forth before ,</l>
     <l n="17">And we waited , to behold it ,</l>
     <l n="18">Till the sun 's hand should unfold it ,</l>
     <l n="19">What the year 's young bosom bore ?</l>
     <l n="20">Even so ; it came , nor knew we that it came ,</l>
     <l n="21">In the sun 's eclipse .</l>
     <l n="22">Yet the birds have plighted vows ,</l>
     <l n="23">And from the branches pipe each other 's name ;</l>
     <l n="24">Yet the season all the boughs</l>
     <l n="25">Has kindled to the finger-tips , -</l>
     <l n="26">Mark yonder , how the long laburnum drips</l>
     <l n="27">Its jocund spilth of fire , its honey of wild flame !</l>
     <l n="28">Yea , and myself put on swift quickening ,</l>
     <l n="29">And answer to the presence of a sudden Spring .</l>
     <l n="30">From cloud-zoned pinnacles of the secret spirit</l>
     <l n="31">Song falls precipitant in dizzying streams ;</l>
     <l n="32">And , like a mountain-hold when war-shouts stir it ,</l>
     <l n="33">The mind 's recessed fastness casts to light</l>
     <l n="34">Its gleaming multitudes , that from every height</l>
     <l n="35">Unfurl the flaming of a thousand dreams .</l>
     <l n="36">Now therefore , thou who bring'st the year to birth ,</l>
     <l n="37">Who guid'st the bare and dabbled feet of May ;</l>
     <l n="38">Sweet stem to that rose Christ , who from the earth</l>
     <l n="39">Suck'st our poor prayers , conveying them to Him ;</l>
     <l n="40">Be aidant , tender Lady , to my lay !</l>
     <l n="41">Of thy two maidens somewhat must I say ,</l>
     <l n="42">Ere shadowy twilight lashes , drooping , dim</l>
     <l n="43">Day 's dreamy eyes from us ;</l>
     <l n="44">Ere eve has struck and furled</l>
     <l n="45">The beamy-textured tent transpicuous ,</l>
     <l n="46">Of webbed coerule wrought and woven calms ,</l>
     <l n="47">Whence has paced forth the lambent-footed sun .</l>
     <l n="48">And Thou disclose my flower of song upcurled ,</l>
     <l n="49">Who from Thy fair irradiant palms</l>
     <l n="50">Scatterest all love and loveliness as alms ;</l>
     <l n="51">Yea , Holy One ,</l>
     <l n="52">Who coin'st Thyself to beauty for the world !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="53">Then , Spring 's little children , your lauds do ye upraise</l>
     <l n="54">To Sylvia , O Sylvia , her sweet , feat ways !</l>
     <l n="55">Your lovesome labours lay away ,</l>
     <l n="56">And trick you out in holiday ,</l>
     <l n="57">For syllabling to Sylvia ;</l>
     <l n="58">And all you birds on branches , lave your mouths with May ,</l>
     <l n="59">To bear with me this burthen ,</l>
     <l n="60">For singing to Sylvia .</l>

      <l n="61">The leaves dance , the leaves sing ,</l>
      <l n="62">The leaves dance in the breath of the Spring .</l>
      <l n="63">I bid them dance ,</l>
      <l n="64">I bid them sing ,</l>
      <l n="65">For the limpid glance</l>
      <l n="66">Of my ladyling ;</l>
      <l n="67">For the gift to the Spring of a dewier spring ,</l>
      <l n="68">For God 's good grace of this ladyling !</l>
      <l n="69">I know in the lane , by the hedgerow track ,</l>
      <l n="70">The long , broad grasses underneath</l>
      <l n="71">Are warted with rain like a toad 's knobbed back ;</l>
      <l n="72">But here May weareth a rainless wreath .</l>
      <l n="73">In the new-sucked milk of the sun 's bosom</l>
      <l n="74">Is dabbled the mouth of the daisy-blossom ;</l>
      <l n="75">The smouldering rosebud chars through its sheath ;</l>
      <l n="76">The lily stirs her snowy limbs ,</l>
      <l n="77">Ere she swims</l>
      <l n="78">Naked up through her cloven green ,</l>
      <l n="79">Like the wave-born Lady of Love Hellene ;</l>
      <l n="80">And the scattered snowdrop exquisite</l>
      <l n="81">Twinkles and gleams ,</l>
      <l n="82">As if the showers of the sunny beams</l>
      <l n="83">Were splashed from the earth in drops of light .</l>
      <l n="84">Everything</l>
      <l n="85">That is child of Spring</l>
      <l n="86">Casts its bud or blossoming</l>

      <l n="97">While thus I stood in mazes bound</l>
      <l n="98">Of vernal sorcery ,</l>
      <l n="99">I heard a dainty dubious sound ,</l>
      <l n="100">As of goodly melody ;</l>
      <l n="101">Which first was faint as if in swound ,</l>
      <l n="102">Then burst so suddenly</l>
      <l n="103">In warring concord all around ,</l>
      <l n="104">That , whence this thing might be ,</l>
      <l n="105">To see</l>
      <l n="106">The very marrow longed in me !</l>
      <l n="107">It seemed of air , it seemed of ground ,</l>
      <l n="108">And never any witchery</l>
      <l n="109">Drawn from pipe , or reed , or string ,</l>
      <l n="110">Made such dulcet ravishing .</l>
      <l n="111">‘ Twas like no earthly instrument ,</l>
      <l n="112">Yet had something of them all</l>
      <l n="113">In its rise , and in its fall ;</l>
      <l n="114">As if in one sweet consort there were blent</l>
      <l n="115">Those archetypes celestial</l>
      <l n="116">Which our endeavouring instruments recall .</l>
      <l n="117">So heavenly flutes made murmurous plain</l>
      <l n="118">To heavenly viols , that again</l>
      <l n="119">- Aching with music — wailed back pain ;</l>
      <l n="120">Regals release their notes , which rise</l>
      <l n="121">Welling , like tears from heart to eyes ;</l>
      <l n="122">And the harp thrills with thronging sighs .</l>
      <l n="123">Horns in mellow flattering</l>
      <l n="124">Parley with the cithern-string : -</l>
      <l n="125">Hark !— the floating , long-drawn note</l>
      <l n="126">Woos the throbbing cithern-string !</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="127">Their pretty , pretty prating those citherns sure upraise</l>

      <l n="130">Their lovely languid language say ,</l>
      <l n="131">For lisping to Sylvia ;</l>
      <l n="132">Those viols ’ lissom bowings break the heart of May ,</l>

      <l n="152">( Through its tenuous veils confest</l>
      <l n="153">Of swathing light ) , in a quaint fancy</l>
      <l n="154">Tied her knot of yellow favours ;</l>
      <l n="155">Others dared open draw</l>
      <l n="156">Snapdragon 's dreadful jaw :</l>

      <l n="164">Still folded in their veiny vans :</l>
      <l n="165">And all with an unsought accord</l>
      <l n="166">Sang together from the sward ;</l>

      <l n="192">Some , with languors of waved arms ,</l>
      <l n="193">Fluctuous oared their flexile way ;</l>

      <l n="200">Newly loosed on this terrene ,</l>
      <l n="201">Shot in piercing swiftness came ,</l>
      <l n="202">With hair a-stream like pale and goblin flame .</l>

      <l n="209">When some passion left its haunt ,</l>
      <l n="210">Radiate surge of colour came ,</l>
      <l n="211">Diffusing blush-wise , palpitant ,</l>
      <l n="212">Dying all the filmy frame .</l>
      <l n="213">With some sweet tenderness they would</l>
      <l n="214">Turn to an amber-clear and glossy gold ;</l>
      <l n="215">Or a fine sorrow , lovely to behold ,</l>

      <l n="221">Curd to the tincture which the opal hath ,</l>
      <l n="222">Like rainbows thawing in a moonbeam bath .</l>

     <l n="1">When the last stir of bubbling melodies</l>
     <l n="2">Broke as my chants sank underneath the wave</l>
     <l n="3">Of dulcitude , but sank again to rise</l>
     <l n="4">Where man 's embaying mind those waters lave ,</l>
     <l n="5">( For music hath its Oceanides</l>
     <l n="6">Flexuously floating through their parent seas ,</l>
     <l n="7">And such are these ) ,</l>
     <l n="8">I saw a vision — or may it be</l>
     <l n="9">The effluence of a dear desired reality ?</l>
     <l n="10">I saw two spirits high , -</l>
     <l n="11">Two spirits , dim within the silver smoke</l>
     <l n="12">Which is for ever woke</l>
     <l n="13">By snowing lights of fountained Poesy .</l>
     <l n="14">Two shapes they were familiar as love ;</l>
     <l n="15">They were those souls , whereof</l>
     <l n="16">One twines from finest gracious daily things ,</l>
     <l n="17">Strong , constant , noticeless , as are heart-strings</l>
     <l n="18">The golden cage wherein this song-bird sings ;</l>
     <l n="19">And the other 's sun gives hue to all my flowers ,</l>
     <l n="20">Which else pale flowers of Tartarus would grow ,</l>
     <l n="21">Where ghosts watch ghosts of blooms in ghostly bowers ; -</l>
     <l n="22">For we do know</l>
     <l n="23">The hidden player by his harmonies ,</l>
     <l n="24">And by my thoughts I know what still hands thrill the keys .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">And to these twain — as from the mind 's abysses</l>
     <l n="26">All thoughts draw toward the awakening heart 's sweet kisses ,</l>
     <l n="27">With proffer of their wreathen fantasies , -</l>
     <l n="28">Even so to these</l>
     <l n="29">I saw how many brought their garlands fair ,</l>
     <l n="30">Whether of song , or simple love , they were , -</l>
     <l n="31">Of simple love , that makes best garlands fair .</l>
     <l n="32">But one I marked who lingered still behind ,</l>
     <l n="33">As for such souls no seemly gift had he :</l>
     <l n="34">He was not of their strain ,</l>
     <l n="35">Nor worthy of so bright beings to entertain ,</l>
     <l n="36">Nor fit compeer for such high company .</l>
     <l n="37">Yet was he , surely , born to them in mind ,</l>
     <l n="38">Their youngest nursling of the spirit 's kind .</l>
     <l n="39">Last stole this one ,</l>
     <l n="40">With timid glance , of watching eyes adread ,</l>
     <l n="41">And dropped his frightened flower when all were gone ;</l>
     <l n="42">And where the frail flower fell , it withered .</l>
     <l n="43">But yet methought those high souls smiled thereon ;</l>
     <l n="44">As when a child , upstraining at your knees</l>
     <l n="45">Some fond and fancied nothings , says , “ I give you these ! ”</l>
