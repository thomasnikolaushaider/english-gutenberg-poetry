  <p>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE</p>
   <p>At the commencement of the year 1885 , a captivating little volume of poems was mysteriously issued from the “ Leadenhalle Presse ” of Messrs. Field and Tuer — a quaint , vellum-bound , antique-looking book , tied up on all sides with strings of golden silk ribbon , and illustrated throughout with fanciful wood-cuts . It was entitled “ Love Letters by a Violinist , ” and those who were at first attracted by its title and suggestive outward appearance , untied the ribbons with a certain amount of curiosity . Love-letters were surely of a private , almost sacred character . What “ Violinist ” thus ventured to publish his heart-records openly ? and were they worth reading ? were the questions asked by the public , and last , not least , came the natural inquiry , “ Who was the ‘ Violinist ’ ? ” To this no satisfactory answer could be obtained , for nobody knew . But it was directly proved on perusal of the book that he was a poet , not a mere writer of verse . Speculations arose as to his identity , and Joseph Ellis , the poet , reviewed the work as follows :—</p>
   <p>“ Behold a mystery — who shall uncase it ? A small quarto , anonymous . The publisher professes entire ignorance of its origin . Wild guesses spring from the mask of a ‘ Violinist ’ — who can he be ? Unde derivatur ? A Tyro ? The work is too skilful for such , though even a Byron . Young ? Not old . Tennyson ? No — he hath not the grace of style , at least for these verses . Browning ? No — he could not unbend so far . Edwin Arnold might , possibly , have been equal to it , witness , inter alia , ‘ Violetta ’ ; but he is unlikely . Lytton Bulwer , a voice from the tomb ? No . His son , Owen Meredith ? A random supposition , yet possible . Rossetti — again a voice from the tomb ? No — he wanted the strength of wing . James Thomson , the younger , could have done it , but he was too stern . Then , our detective ingenuity proving incompetent , who ? We seek the Delphic fane — the oracle replies Swinburne . Let us bow to the oracular voice , for in Swinburne we find all requisites for the work — fertility of thought , grace of language , ingenuity , skill in the ars poetica , wealth of words , sensuous nature , classic resources . * * * The writer of the ‘ Love-Letters ’ is manifestly imbued with the tone and tune of Italian poetry , and has the merit of proving the English tongue capable of rivalling the Italian ‘ Canzoni d'Amore . ’ * * * * He is a master of versification , so is Swinburne — he is praiseworthy for freshness of thought , novelty , and aptness in imagery , so is Swinburne . He is remarkable for sustained energy , so is Swinburne ; and thus it may safely be said that , if not the writer of the ‘ Love-Letters , ’ he deserves to be accredited with that mysterious production , until the authorship is avowed . * * * * Unto Britannia , as erst to Italia , has been granted a a Petrarch . ”</p>
   <p>Meanwhile other leading voices in the Press joined the swelling chorus of praise . The Morning Post took up the theme , and , after vainly endeavouring to clear up the mystery of the authorship , went on to say : “ The appearance of this book must be regarded as a literary phenomenon . We find ourselves lifted at once by the author 's genius out of the work-a-day world of the England of to-day , and transported into an atmosphere as rare and ethereal as that in which the poet of Vaucluse lived and moved and had his being . * * * * In nearly every stanza there are unerring indications of a mind and heart steeped in that subtlest of all forms of beauty , the mythology of old Greece . The reader perceives at once that he has to do with a scholar and man of culture , as well as with an inspired singer , whose muse need not feel abashed in the presence of the highest poets of our own day . ”</p>
   <p>Such expressions as , “ A new star of brilliant magnitude has risen above the literary horizon in the anonymous author of the exquisite book of ‘ Love-Letters , ’ ” and “ These poems are among the most graceful and beautiful productions of modern times , ” became frequent in the best literary journals , and private opinion concerning the book began to make its influence felt . The brilliant writer and astute critic , George Meredith , wrote to a friend on the subject as follows :—</p>
   <p>“ The lines and metre of the poems are easy and interthreading and perfectly melodious . It is an astonishing production — the work of a true musician in our tongue . ”</p>
   <p>The Times ’ special correspondent , Antonio Gallenga , expressed himself at some length on the merits of the “ Violinist , ” and spoke of him “ as one who could conjure up a host of noble thoughts and bright fancies , who rejoices in a great command of language , with a flow of verse and a wealth of rhymes . It is impossible to hear his confessions , to follow him in his aspirations , to hear the tale of his visions , his trances , his dreams , without catching his enthusiasm and bestowing on him our sympathy . Each ‘ Love-Letter ’ is in twenty stanzas — each stanza in six lines . The poem is regular and symmetrical as Dante 's ‘ Comedy , ’ with as stately and solemn , aye , and as arduous a measure . ” While the world of art and letters thus discussed the volume , reading it meanwhile with such eagerness that the whole edition was soon entirely exhausted , a particularly brilliant and well-written critique of it appeared in the New York Independent — a very prominent American journal , destined afterwards to declare the author 's identity , and to be the first to do so . In the columns of this paper had been frequently seen some peculiarly graceful and impassioned poems , signed by one Eric Mackay — notable among these being a lyric entitled “ The Waking of the Lark ” ( included in our present volume ) , which , to quote the expression of a distinguished New York critic , “ sent a thrill through the heart of America . ” There are no skylarks in the New World , but there is a deep tenderness felt by all Americans for the little</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Priest in grey apparel</l>
     <l n="2">Who doth prepare to sing in air his sinless summer carol , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and Eric Mackay 's exquisite outburst of tender enthusiasm for the English bird of the morning evoked from all parts of the States a chorus of critical delight and approbation . The Rev . T. T. Munger , of Massachusetts , wrote concerning it :—</p>
   <p>“ This strikes me as the best poem I have seen for a long time . As I read it stanza after stanza , with not an imperfect verse , not a commonplace , but with a sustained increase of pure sentiment and glowing fancy , I was inclined to place it beside Shelley 's . It is not so intellectual as Shelley 's , but I am not sure that it is not truer . Mackay 's is the lark itself , Shelley 's is himself listening to the lark . Besides Shelley makes the lark sing at evening — as I believe it does — but surely ‘ it to the morning doth belong , ’ and Shakespeare is truer in putting it at ‘ Heaven 's gate . ’ It is a great refreshment to us tired workers in the prose of life to come across such a poem as this , and seldom enough it happens nowadays . Tell Mr. Eric Mackay to sing us another song . ”</p>
   <p>Paul Hamilton Hayne , an American poet , praised it in an American paper ; and the cultured Maurice Thompson writes :— “ This lark-song touches the best mark of simplicity , sweetness , and naturalness in its modelling . ”</p>
   <p>This admired lyric was copied from the Independent into many other journals , together with several other poems by the same hand , such as “ A Vision of Beethoven , ” the beautiful verses addressed to the Spanish violinist , Pablo de Sarasate , and a spirited reply to Algernon Charles Swinburne , reproaching him for the attack which the author of “ Tristram of Lyonesse ” had made on England 's name and fame . One day a simple statement appeared in the Independent respecting the much discussed “ Love-Letters by a Violinist , ” that the author was simply a gentleman of good position , the descendant of a distinguished and very ancient family , Eric Mackay , known among his personal friends and intimates as a man of brilliant and extensive learning , whose frequent and long residences abroad have made him somewhat of a foreigner , though by birth an Englishman . A fine linguist , a deep thinker , a profound student of the classics , Mr. Mackay may be ranked among the most cultured and accomplished men of his day , and still young as he is , will undoubtedly be numbered with the choice few whose names are destined to live by the side of poets such as Keats , whom , as far as careful work , delicate feeling , and fiery tenderness go , Eric Mackay may be said to resemble , though there is a greater robustness and force in his muse , indicative of a strong mind in an equally strong and healthy body , which latter advantage the divine Keats had not , unfortunately for himself and the world . The innate , hardly restrained vigour of Mr. Mackay 's nature shows itself in such passages as occur in the sonnets , “ Remorse , ” “ A Thunderstorm at Night ; ” also in the wild and terribly suggestive “ Zulalie , ” while something of hot wrath and scorn leap out in such lines as those included in his ode to Swinburne , whom he addresses :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ O thou five foot five</l>
     <l n="2">Of flesh and blood and sinew and the rest . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Thou art a bee , a bright , a golden thing</l>
     <l n="4">With too much honey , and the taste thereof</l>
     <l n="5">Is sometimes rough , and something of a sting</l>
     <l n="6">Dwells in the music that we hear thee sing . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">and</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="8">“ Take back thy taunt , I say ; and with the same</l>
     <l n="9">Accept our pardon ; or if this offend ,</l>
     <l n="10">Why , then , no pardon , e'en in England 's name .</l>
     <l n="11">We have our country still , and thou thy fame ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="12">At the same time no one in all England does more justice and honor to</l>
     <l n="13">Swinburne 's genius than Eric Mackay .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>His own strength as a poet suggests to the reader the idea of a spirited horse reined in tightly and persistently ,— a horse which prances wildly at times and frets and foams at the bit , and might , on the least provocation , run wild in a furious and headlong career , sweeping all conventionalities out of its road by a sheer , straight-ahead gallop . Mr. Mackay is , however , a careful , even precise rider , and he keeps a firm hand on his restless Pegasus — so firm that , as his taste always leads him to depict the most fanciful and fine emotions , his steady resoluteness of restraint commands not only our admiration but our respect . While passionate to an extreme in the “ Love-Letters , ” he is never indelicate ; the coarse , almost brutal , allusions made by some writers to certain phases of so-called love , which are best left unsuggested , never defile the pen of our present author , who may almost be called fastidious in such matters . How beautiful and all-sufficing to the mind is the line expressing the utter satisfaction of a victorious lover :—</p>
   <p>“ Crowned with a kiss and sceptred with a joy ! ”</p>
   <p>No details are needed here — all is said . The “ Violinist , ” though by turns regretful , sorrowful , and despairing , is supreme throughout . He speaks of the “ lady of his song ” as</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The lady for whose sake I shall be strong ,</l>
     <l n="2">But never weak or diffident again . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The supremacy of manhood is insisted on always ; and the lover , though he entreats , implores , wonders and raves as all lovers do , never forgets his own dignity . He will take no second-best affection on his lady 's part — this he plainly states in verse 19 of Letter V. Again , in the last letter of all , he asserts his mastery — and this is as it should be ; absolute authority , as he knows , is the way to win and to keep a woman 's affections . Such lovely fancies as</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Phoebus loosens all his golden hair</l>
     <l n="2">Right down the sky — and daisies turn and stare</l>
     <l n="3">At things we see not with our human wit , ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">and</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ A tuneful noise</l>
     <l n="6">Broke from the copse where late a breeze was slain ,</l>
     <l n="7">And nightingales in ecstacy of pain</l>
     <l n="8">Did break their hearts with singing the old joys , ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>abound all through the book . And here it is as well to mark the decision of our poet , even in trifles . The breeze he speaks of is not hushed , or still — none of the usual epithets are applied to it — it is “ slain , ” as utterly and as pitifully as though it were a murdered child . This originality of conception is remarkable , and comes out in such lines as</p>
   <p>“ I will unpack my mind of all its fears ” —</p>
   <p>where the word “ unpack ” is singularly appropriate , and again —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ O sweet To-morrow ! Youngest of the sons</l>
     <l n="2">Of old King Time , to whom Creation runs</l>
     <l n="3">As men to God . ”</l>
     <l n="4">“ Where a daisy grows ,</l>
     <l n="5">There grows a joy ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and beautiful and dainty to a high degree is the quaint “ Retrospect , ” where the lover enthusiastically draws the sun and moon into his ecstasies , and makes them seem to partake in his admiration of his lady 's loveliness .</p>
   <p>A graver and more philosophic turn of mind will be found in “ A Song of Servitude , ” and “ A Rhapsody of Death ; ” but , judged from a critical standpoint , Eric Mackay is a purely passionate poet , straying amongst the most voluptuous imaginings , and sometimes seeming to despise the joys of Heaven itself for the sake of love . Thus he lays himself open to an accusation of blasphemy from ultra-religious persons , yet it must be remembered that in this respect he in no way exceeds the emotions of Romeo , and Juliet , Paolo and Francesca da Rimini , or any of those lovers whose passion has earned for their names an undying celebrity .</p>
   <p>In closing the present notice we can but express a hope that this volume of Eric Mackay 's poems may meet with the welcome it deserves from true lovers of Art ; for Art includes Poetry ; and Poetry , as properly defined is one of its grandest and most enduring forms .</p>
