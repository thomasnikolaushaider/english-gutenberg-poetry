     <l n="56">Th ’ big jag day — th ’ glad rag play , that brings th ’ Yukon fame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="57">It was Fool 's Day f'r th ’ Race ; every husky in his place ;</l>
     <l n="58">Wasky 's dogs was runnin ’ Billy Brown of Nome ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="65">Oh , th ’ run was cruel hard — th ’ white frost how it scarred</l>
     <l n="66">As they galloped down th ’ long , unending trail ;</l>
     <l n="67">The whip cut like th ’ wind , an ’ Carey 's dog , snow-blind ,</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Two-an ’ - eighty hours they raced — an ’ four hunderd-miles they paced , Them dogs never paused f'r frozen fish ‘ r drink ; Hung with icicles of foam , the'r lithe bodies stretched whale-bone ,— BUT THEY BROKE THE RECORD MADE BY JIMMIE FINK !</p>

   <p>AN ’ WE 'LL DRINK T ’ YOU , RED-JACKET ; THE EQUATOR OF YOUR VEST BUNCHES ALL THE PRIDE AN ’ GLORY OF TH ’ WILD AN ’ WOOLLY WEST !</p>

     <l n="3">A chump ‘ round this camp —— Ma'am , wot was th ’ same</l>
     <l n="4">Double-decker y ’ called b ’ th ’ telescope name ? ” ——</l>
     <l n="5">But the lady , eyes staring , was shrieking , “ MY SON ! ”</l>
     <l n="6">Lo ! “ Windy ” be-whiskered was “ DASHING BEAU-DUNNE ! ”</l>

    <head>MY SONG</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I could not sing unless my song</l>
     <l n="2">Had in its symphony one broken string ;</l>
     <l n="3">I could not say the thoughts that in me rise</l>
     <l n="4">Unless my heart had been a broken thing .</l>
     <l n="5">Why is it that the voice of Song so yields</l>
     <l n="6">Mute music till the heart hath bled ?</l>
     <l n="7">Why should we find most fair and far-off fields</l>
     <l n="8">By thorny by-paths led ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">But if this little weakling song of mine</l>
     <l n="10">Might carry cheer to one , lone , grieving soul ,</l>
     <l n="11">Most gladly would I offer Hope 's bright wine</l>
     <l n="12">And , smiling , drink the lees left in the bowl :</l>
     <l n="13">For I have in the darkness found some light ,—</l>
     <l n="14">Some sunshine seen in shadowed evening hours ,</l>
     <l n="15">And I have found throughout the lonely night</l>
     <l n="16">Some perfumed breathings from wild garden bowers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">And I were ingrate not to send it on ,</l>
     <l n="18">Such echo of what music in me lies ,</l>
     <l n="19">For it may bring to some o'er darkened dawn</l>
     <l n="20">The brightening glow that comes with morning skies .</l>
     <l n="21">So , go you , little broken Song ,</l>
     <l n="22">And carry to some heart in bitter pain</l>
     <l n="23">Only my lute 's light laughter . Make thou strong</l>
     <l n="24">The weak of heart and bid them smile again .</l>
