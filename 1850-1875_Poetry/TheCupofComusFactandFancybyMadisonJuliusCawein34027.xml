     <l n="1">Friend , for the sake of loves we hold in common ,</l>
     <l n="2">The love of books , of paintings , rhyme and fiction ;</l>
     <l n="3">And for the sake of that divine affliction ,</l>
     <l n="4">The love of art , passing the love of woman ;—</l>
     <l n="5">By which all life 's made nobler , superhuman ,</l>
     <l n="6">Lifting the soul above , and , without friction</l>
     <l n="7">Of Time , that puts failure in his prediction ,—</l>
     <l n="8">Works to some end through hearts that dreams illumine :</l>
     <l n="9">To you I pour this Cup of Dreams — a striver ,</l>
     <l n="10">And dreamer too in this sad world ,— unwitting</l>
     <l n="11">Of that you do , the help that still assureth ,—</l>
     <l n="12">Lifts up the heart , struck down by that dark driver ,</l>
     <l n="13">Despair , who , on Life 's pack-horse — effort — sitting ,</l>

     <l n="4">We strolled together ‘ neath the greening trees ,</l>
     <l n="5">And heard the robin tune its flute note clear ,</l>
     <l n="6">And watched above the white cloud squadrons veer .</l>
     <l n="7">And saw their shifting shadows drift away</l>
     <l n="8">Adown the Hudson , as ships seek the seas .</l>

     <l n="17">Beauty in humble weed and mint and cress .</l>

   <p>CLINTON SCOLLARD .</p>
   <p>FOREWORD</p>
   <p>It is with a sense of sadness and regret that this book , written by one who universally has endeared himself to lovers of nature through his revelation of her mysteries , must be prefaced as containing the last songs of this exquisite singer of the South .</p>
   <p>When the final word is spoken it is fitting that it be by one of authority . William Dean Howells , in the pages of The North American Review , offers this tribute :</p>
   <p>“ I had read his poetry and loved it from the beginning , and in each successive expression of it , I had delighted in its expanding and maturing beauty . Between the earliest and the latest thing there may have been a hundred different things in the swan-like life of a singer ... but we take the latest as if it summed him up in motive and range and tendency .... Not one of his lovely landscapes but thrilled with a human presence penetrating to it from his most sensitive and subtle spirit until it was all but painfully alive with memories , with regrets , with longings , with hopes , with all that from time to time mutably constitutes us men and women , and yet keeps us children . He has the gift , in a measure , that I do not think surpassed in any poet , of touching some commonest thing in nature , and making it live , from the manifold associations in which we have our being , and glow thereafter with an indistinguishable beauty .... No other poet can outword this poet when it comes to choosing some epithet fresh from the earth and air , and with the morning sun and light upon it , for an emotion or an experience in which the race renews its youth from generation to generation .... His touch leaves everything that was dull to the sense before glowing in the light of joyful recognition . ”</p>
   <p>With a tone of conviction Edwin Markham says :</p>
   <p>“ No other poet of the later American choir offers so large a collection of verse as Mr. Cawein does , and no other American minstrel has so unvarying a devotion to nature . And none other , perhaps , has so keen an eye , so sure a word for nature 's magic of mood , her trick of color , her change of form . He is not so wild and far-flying as Bliss Carmen , nor so large and elemental as Joaquin Miller ; but he is often as delicate and eerie as Aldrich , and sometimes as warm and rich as Keats in the April affluence of ‘ Endymion . ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ Mr. Cawein 's landscape is not the sea , nor the desert , nor the mountain , but the lovely inland levels of his Kentucky . His work is almost wholly objective . A dash more of human import mixed into the beauty and melody of his poetry would rank him with Lowell and the other great lyrists of our elder choir . ”</p>
   <p>Some of the new poems portray a high moral passion , potent with the belief of life beyond , where his delicacy of vision penetrates the shadow and seems to have sighted the shore that has given his soul greeting “ somewhere yonder in a world uncharted . ”</p>
   <p>Clear , sure , and strong is the vocal loveliness and inevitable word with which this poet endears the little forms of life in the field of Faery . The “ Song of Songs ” ( 1913 ) could be characterized as prophecy , by one in whom seemed inherent the fatal instinct of the predestined . He sought for “ Song to lead her way above the crags of wrong , ” and he gave</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Such music as a bird</l>
     <l n="2">Gives of its soul when dying</l>
     <l n="3">Unconscious if it 's heard ! ”</l>
     <l n="4">And so he went , singing , to his “ Islands of Infinity . ”</l>

     <l n="2">The wind makes moan , the water runneth chill ;</l>
     <l n="3">I hear the nymphs go crying through the brake ;</l>
     <l n="4">And roaming mournfully from hill to hill</l>
     <l n="5">The maenads all are silent for his sake !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">He loved thy pipe , O wreathed and piping Pan !</l>
     <l n="7">So play'st thou sadly , lone within thine hollow ;</l>
     <l n="8">He was thy blood , if ever mortal man ,</l>
     <l n="9">Therefore thou weepest — even thou , Apollo !</l>

     <l n="10">But O , the grieving of the Little Things ,</l>
     <l n="11">Above the pipe and lyre , throughout the woods !</l>
     <l n="12">The beating of a thousand airy wings ,</l>
     <l n="13">The cry of all the fragile multitudes !</l>

     <l n="14">The moth flits desolate , the tree-toad calls ,</l>

     <l n="18">And risen on these winter paths anew ,</l>

     <l n="22">Here , here the pain is sharpest ! For he walked</l>
     <l n="23">As one of these — and they knew naught of fear ,</l>
     <l n="24">But told him daily happenings and talked</l>
     <l n="25">Their lovely secrets in his list'ning ear !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">Yet we do bid them grieve , and tell their grief ;</l>
     <l n="27">Else were they thankless , else were all untrue ;</l>
     <l n="28">O wind and stream , O bee and bird and leaf ,</l>
     <l n="29">Mourn for your poet , with a long adieu !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There is a smell of roses in the room</l>
     <l n="2">Tea-roses , dead of bloom ;</l>
     <l n="3">An invalid , she sits there in the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="4">And contemplates her doom .</l>

     <l n="5">The pattern of the paper , and the grain .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">It has been long , so long , since that one died ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or sat there by her side ;</l>
     <l n="11">She felt so lonely , lost , she would have cried ,—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">A knock came on the door : she hardly heard ;</l>
     <l n="14">And then — a whispered word ,</l>
     <l n="15">And someone entered ; at which , like a bird ,</l>
     <l n="16">Her caged heart cried and stirred .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">And then — she heard a voice ; she was not wrong :</l>
     <l n="18">His voice , alive and strong :</l>
     <l n="19">She listened , while the silence filled with song —</l>
     <l n="20">Oh , she had waited long !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">She dared not turn to see ; she dared not look ;</l>
     <l n="22">But slowly closed her book ,</l>
     <l n="23">And waited for his kiss ; could scarcely brook</l>
     <l n="24">The weary time he took .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">There was no one remembered her — no one !</l>
     <l n="26">But him , beneath the sun ,—</l>
     <l n="27">Who then had entered ? entered but to shun</l>
     <l n="28">Her whose long work was done .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">She raised her eyes , and — no one !— Yet she felt</l>
     <l n="30">A presence near , that smelt</l>
     <l n="31">Like faded roses ; and that seemed to melt</l>
     <l n="32">Into her soul that knelt .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">She could not see , but knew that he was there ,</l>
     <l n="34">Smoothing her hands and hair ;</l>
     <l n="35">Filling with scents of roses all the air ,</l>
     <l n="36">Standing beside her chair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">And so they found her , sitting quietly ,</l>
     <l n="38">Her book upon her knee ,</l>
     <l n="39">Staring before her , as if she could see —</l>
     <l n="40">What was it — Death ? or he ?</l>

     <l n="9">Clad as in days of belle and beau ,</l>

     <l n="19">And , humming to himself a tune ,</l>
     <l n="20">— “ Lorena ” or “ Ben Bolt ” we 'll say ,—</l>

     <l n="23">The Yesterday that holds his all —</l>

     <l n="26">Still reaching out for her his hands —</l>
     <l n="27">For her , the girl , who waits him there ,</l>
     <l n="28">A lace-gowned phantom , dark of hair ,</l>
     <l n="29">Whose loveliness still keeps those walks ,</l>

     <l n="31">Upon his heart her happy head ,—</l>

     <l n="1">I came upon a pool that shone ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">A temple of a race unblessed</l>

     <l n="11">Where , on an altar , bare of breast ,</l>

     <l n="21">Amorphous , strangely old , he glared</l>

     <l n="25">Then turned to me a face of stone</l>
