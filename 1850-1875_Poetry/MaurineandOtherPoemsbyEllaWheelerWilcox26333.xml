    <docImprint>W. B. Conkey Company<settlement>Chicago</settlement>Copyright ,<date>1888</date>by Ella Wheeler Wilcox I step across the mystic border-land , And look upon the wonder-world of Art . How beautiful , how beautiful its hills ! And all its valleys , how surpassing fair ! The winding paths that lead up to the heights Are polished by the footsteps of the great . The mountain-peaks stand very near to God : The chosen few whose feet have trod thereon Have talked with Him , and with the angels walked . Here are no sounds of discord — no profane Or senseless gossip of unworthy things — Only the songs of chisels and of pens . Of busy brushes , and ecstatic strains Of souls surcharged with music most divine . Here is no idle sorrow , no poor grief For any day or object left behind — For time is counted precious , and herein Is such complete abandonment of Self That tears turn into rainbows , and enhance The beauty of the land where all is fair . Awed and afraid , I cross the border-land . Oh , who am I , that I dare enter here Where the great artists of the world have trod — The genius-crowned aristocrats of Earth ? Only the singer of a little song ; Yet loving Art with such a mighty love I hold it greater to have won a place Just on the fair land 's edge , to make my grave , Than in the outer world of greed and gain To sit upon a royal throne and reign .</docImprint>

    <head>PART I .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I sat and sewed , and sang some tender tune ,</l>
     <l n="2">Oh , beauteous was that morn in early June !</l>
     <l n="3">Mellow with sunlight , and with blossoms fair :</l>
     <l n="4">The climbing rose-tree grew about me there ,</l>
     <l n="5">And checked with shade the sunny portico</l>
     <l n="6">Where , morns like this , I came to read , or sew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">I heard the gate click , and a firm quick tread</l>
     <l n="8">Upon the walk . No need to turn my head ;</l>
     <l n="9">I would mistake , and doubt my own voice sounding ,</l>
     <l n="10">Before his step upon the gravel bounding .</l>
     <l n="11">In an unstudied attitude of grace ,</l>
     <l n="12">He stretched his comely form ; and from his face</l>
     <l n="13">He tossed the dark , damp curls ; and at my knees ,</l>
     <l n="14">With his broad hat he fanned the lazy breeze ,</l>
     <l n="15">And turned his head , and lifted his large eyes ,</l>
     <l n="16">Of that strange hue we see in ocean dyes ,</l>
     <l n="17">And call it blue sometimes , and sometimes green</l>
     <l n="18">And save in poet eyes , not elsewhere seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">“ Lest I should meet with my fair lady 's scorning ,</l>
     <l n="20">For calling quite so early in the morning ,</l>
     <l n="21">I 've brought a passport that can never fail , ”</l>
     <l n="22">He said , and , laughing , laid the morning mail</l>
     <l n="23">Upon my lap . “ I 'm welcome ? so I thought !</l>
     <l n="24">I 'll figure by the letters that I brought</l>
     <l n="25">How glad you are to see me . Only one ?</l>
     <l n="26">And that one from a lady ? I 'm undone !</l>
     <l n="27">That , lightly skimmed , you 'll think me such a bore ,</l>
     <l n="28">And wonder why I did not bring you four .</l>
     <l n="29">It 's ever thus : a woman cannot get</l>
     <l n="30">So many letters that she will not fret</l>
     <l n="31">O'er one that did not come . ”</l>
     <l n="32">“ I 'll prove you wrong , ”</l>
     <l n="33">I answered gayly , “ here upon the spot !</l>
     <l n="34">This little letter , precious if not long ,</l>
     <l n="35">Is just the one , of all you might have brought ,</l>
     <l n="36">To please me . You have heard me speak , I 'm sure ,</l>
     <l n="37">Of Helen Trevor : she writes here to say</l>
     <l n="38">She 's coming out to see me ; and will stay</l>
     <l n="39">Till Autumn , maybe . She is , like her note ,</l>
     <l n="40">Petite and dainty , tender , loving , pure .</l>
     <l n="41">You 'd know her by a letter that she wrote ,</l>
     <l n="42">For a sweet tinted thing . ‘ Tis always so :—</l>
     <l n="43">Letters all blots , though finely written , show</l>
     <l n="44">A slovenly person . Letters stiff and white</l>
     <l n="45">Bespeak a nature honest , plain , upright .</l>
     <l n="46">And tissuey , tinted , perfumed notes , like this ,</l>
     <l n="47">Tell of a creature formed to pet and kiss . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="48">My listener heard me with a slow , odd smile ;</l>
     <l n="49">Stretched in abandon at my feet , the while ,</l>
     <l n="50">He fanned me idly with his broad-brimmed hat .</l>
     <l n="51">“ Then all young ladies must be formed for that ! ”</l>
     <l n="52">He laughed , and said .</l>
     <l n="53">“ Their letters read , and look ,</l>
     <l n="54">As like as twenty copies of one book .</l>
     <l n="55">They 're written in a dainty , spider scrawl ,</l>
     <l n="56">To ‘ darling , precious Kate , ’ or ‘ Fan , ’ or ‘ Moll . ’</l>
     <l n="57">The ‘ dearest , sweetest ’ friend they ever had .</l>
     <l n="58">They say they ‘ want to see you , oh , so bad ! ’</l>
     <l n="59">Vow they 'll ‘ forget you , never , never , oh ! ’</l>
     <l n="60">And then they tell about a splendid beau —</l>
     <l n="61">A lovely hat — a charming dress , and send</l>
     <l n="62">A little scrap of this to every friend .</l>
     <l n="63">And then to close , for lack of something better ,</l>
     <l n="64">They beg you 'll ‘ read and burn this horrid letter . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="65">He watched me , smiling . He was prone to vex</l>
     <l n="66">And hector me with flings upon my sex .</l>
     <l n="67">He liked , he said , to have me flash and frown ,</l>
     <l n="68">So he could tease me , and then laugh me down .</l>
     <l n="69">My storms of wrath amused him very much :</l>
     <l n="70">He liked to see me go off at a touch ;</l>
     <l n="71">Anger became me — made my color rise ,</l>
     <l n="72">And gave an added luster to my eyes .</l>
     <l n="73">So he would talk — and so he watched me now ,</l>
     <l n="74">To see the hot flush mantle cheek and brow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="75">Instead , I answered coolly , with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="76">Felling a seam with utmost care , meanwhile .</l>
     <l n="77">“ The caustic tongue of Vivian Dangerfield</l>
     <l n="78">Is barbed as ever , for my sex , this morn .</l>
     <l n="79">Still unconvinced , no smallest point I yield .</l>
     <l n="80">Woman I love , and trust , despite your scorn .</l>
     <l n="81">There is some truth in what you say ? Well , yes !</l>
     <l n="82">Your statements usually hold more or less .</l>
     <l n="83">Some women write weak letters — ( some men do ;)</l>
     <l n="84">Some make professions , knowing them untrue .</l>
     <l n="85">And woman 's friendship , in the time of need ,</l>
     <l n="86">I own , too often proves a broken reed .</l>
     <l n="87">But I believe , and ever will contend ,</l>
     <l n="88">Woman can be a sister woman 's friend ,</l>
     <l n="89">Giving from out her large heart 's bounteous store</l>
     <l n="90">A living love — claiming to do no more</l>
     <l n="91">Than , through and by that love , she knows she can ;</l>
     <l n="92">And living by her professions , like a man .</l>
     <l n="93">And such a tie , true friendship 's silken tether ,</l>
     <l n="94">Binds Helen Trevor 's heart and mine together .</l>
     <l n="95">I love her for her beauty , meekness , grace ;</l>
     <l n="96">For her white lily soul and angel face .</l>
     <l n="97">She loves me , for my greater strength , may be ;</l>
     <l n="98">Loves — and would give her heart 's best blood for me</l>
     <l n="99">And I , to save her from a pain , or cross ,</l>
     <l n="100">Would suffer any sacrifice or loss .</l>
     <l n="101">Such can be woman 's friendship for another .</l>
     <l n="102">Could man give more , or ask more from a brother ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="103">I paused : and Vivian leaned his massive head</l>
     <l n="104">Against the pillar of the portico ,</l>
     <l n="105">Smiled his slow , skeptic smile , then laughed , and said :</l>
     <l n="106">“ Nay , surely not — if what you say be so .</l>
     <l n="107">You 've made a statement , but no proof 's at hand .</l>
     <l n="108">Wait — do not flash your eyes so ! Understand</l>
     <l n="109">I think you quite sincere in what you say :</l>
     <l n="110">You love your friend , and she loves you , to-day ;</l>
     <l n="111">But friendship is not friendship at the best</l>
     <l n="112">Till circumstances put it to the test .</l>
     <l n="113">Man 's , less demonstrative , stands strain and tear ,</l>
     <l n="114">While woman 's , half profession , fails to wear .</l>
     <l n="115">Two women love each other passing well —</l>
     <l n="116">Say Helen Trevor and Maurine La Pelle ,</l>
     <l n="117">Just for example .</l>
     <l n="118">Let them daily meet</l>
     <l n="119">At ball and concert , in the church and street ,</l>
     <l n="120">They kiss and coo , they visit , chat , caress ;</l>
     <l n="121">Their love increases , rather than grows less ;</l>
     <l n="122">And all goes well , till ‘ Helen dear ’ discovers</l>
     <l n="123">That ‘ Maurine darling ’ wins too many lovers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="124">And then her ‘ precious friend , ’ her ‘ pet , ’ her ‘ sweet , ’</l>
     <l n="125">Becomes a ‘ minx , ’ a ‘ creature all deceit . ’</l>
     <l n="126">Let Helen smile too oft on Maurine 's beaux ,</l>
     <l n="127">Or wear more stylish or becoming clothes ,</l>
     <l n="128">Or sport a hat that has a longer feather —</l>
     <l n="129">And lo ! the strain has broken ‘ friendship 's tether . ’</l>
     <l n="130">Maurine 's sweet smile becomes a frown or pout ;</l>
     <l n="131">‘ She 's just begun to find that Helen out ’</l>
     <l n="132">The breach grows wider — anger fills each heart ;</l>
     <l n="133">They drift asunder , whom ‘ but death could part . ’</l>
     <l n="134">You shake your head ? Oh , well , we 'll never know !</l>
     <l n="135">It is not likely Fate will test you so .</l>
     <l n="136">You 'll live , and love ; and , meeting twice a year ,</l>
     <l n="137">While life shall last , you 'll hold each other dear .</l>
     <l n="138">I pray it may be so ; it were not best</l>
     <l n="139">To shake your faith in woman by the test .</l>
     <l n="140">Keep your belief , and nurse it while you can .</l>
     <l n="141">I 've faith in woman 's friendship too — for man !</l>
     <l n="142">They 're true as steel , as mothers , friends , and wives :</l>
     <l n="143">And that 's enough to bless us all our lives .</l>
     <l n="144">That man 's a selfish fellow , and a bore ,</l>
     <l n="145">Who is unsatisfied , and asks for more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="146">“ But there is need of more ! ” I here broke in .</l>
     <l n="147">“ I hold that woman guilty of a sin ,</l>
     <l n="148">Who would not cling to , and defend another ,</l>
     <l n="149">As nobly as she would stand by a brother .</l>
     <l n="150">Who would not suffer for a sister 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="151">And , were there need to prove her friendship , make</l>
     <l n="152">‘ Most any sacrifice , nor count the cost .</l>
     <l n="153">Who would not do this for a friend is lost</l>
     <l n="154">To every nobler principle . ”</l>
     <l n="155">“ Shame , shame ! ”</l>
     <l n="156">Cried Vivian , laughing , “ for you now defame</l>
     <l n="157">The whole sweet sex ; since there 's not one would do</l>
     <l n="158">The thing you name , nor would I want her to .</l>
     <l n="159">I love the sex . My mother was a woman —</l>
     <l n="160">I hope my wife will be , and wholly human .</l>
     <l n="161">And if she wants to make some sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="162">I 'll think her far more sensible and wise</l>
     <l n="163">To let her husband reap the benefit ,</l>
     <l n="164">Instead of some old maid or senseless chit .</l>
     <l n="165">Selfish ? Of course ! I hold all love is so :</l>
     <l n="166">And I shall love my wife right well , I know .</l>
     <l n="167">Now there 's a point regarding selfish love ,</l>
     <l n="168">You thirst to argue with me , and disprove .</l>

     <l n="1">To little birds that never tire of humming</l>
     <l n="2">About the garden , in the summer weather ,</l>
     <l n="3">Aunt Ruth compared us , after Helen 's coming ,</l>
     <l n="4">As we two roamed , or sat and talked together .</l>
     <l n="5">Twelve months apart , we had so much to say</l>
     <l n="6">Of school days gone — and time since passed away ;</l>
     <l n="7">Of that old friend , and this ; of what we 'd done ;</l>
     <l n="8">Of how our separate paths in life had run ;</l>
     <l n="9">Of what we would do , in the coming years ;</l>
     <l n="10">Of plans and castles , hopes and dreams and fears .</l>
     <l n="11">All these , and more , as soon as we found speech ,</l>
     <l n="12">We touched upon , and skimmed from this to that</l>
     <l n="13">But at the first , each only gazed on each ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , dumb with joy , that did not need a voice</l>
     <l n="15">Like lesser joys , to say , “ Lo ! I rejoice , ”</l>
     <l n="16">With smiling eyes and clasping hands we sat</l>
     <l n="17">Wrapped in that peace , felt but with those dear ,</l>
     <l n="18">Contented just to know each other near .</l>
     <l n="19">But when this silent eloquence gave place</l>
     <l n="20">To words , ‘ twas like the rising of a flood</l>
     <l n="21">Above a dam . We sat there , face to face ,</l>

     <l n="23">Speech never halting in its speed or zest ,</l>
     <l n="24">Save when our rippling laughter let it rest ;</l>
     <l n="25">Just as a stream will sometimes pause and play</l>

     <l n="144">My simplest robe , but Vivian 's favorite one .</l>
     <l n="145">And placing a single flowret in my hair ,</l>
     <l n="146">I crossed the hall to Helen 's chamber , where</l>
     <l n="147">I found her with her fair locks all let down ,</l>
     <l n="148">Brushing the kinks out , with a pretty frown .</l>
     <l n="149">‘ T was like a picture , or a pleasing play ,</l>
     <l n="150">To watch her make her toilet . She would stand ,</l>
     <l n="151">And turn her head first this and then that way ,</l>
     <l n="152">Trying effect of ribbon , bow or band .</l>
     <l n="153">Then she would pick up something else , and curve</l>
     <l n="154">Her lovely neck , with cunning , bird-like grace ,</l>
     <l n="155">And watch the mirror while she put it on ,</l>
     <l n="156">With such a sweetly grave and thoughtful face ;</l>
     <l n="157">And then to view it all would sway , and swerve</l>
     <l n="158">Her lithe young body , like a graceful swan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="159">Helen was over medium height , and slender</l>
     <l n="160">Even to frailty . Her great , wistful eyes</l>
     <l n="161">Were like the deep blue of autumnal skies ;</l>
     <l n="162">And through them looked her soul , large , loving , tender .</l>
     <l n="163">Her long , light hair was lusterless , except</l>
     <l n="164">Upon the ends , where burnished sunbeams slept ,</l>
     <l n="165">And on the earlocks ; and she looped the curls</l>
     <l n="166">Back with a shell comb , studded thick with pearls ,</l>
     <l n="167">Costly yet simple . Her pale loveliness ,</l>
     <l n="168">That night , was heightened by her rich , black dress ,</l>
     <l n="169">That trailed behind her , leaving half in sight</l>
     <l n="170">Her taper arms , and shoulders marble white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="171">I was not tall as Helen , and my face</l>
     <l n="172">Was shaped and colored like my grandsire 's race ;</l>
     <l n="173">For through his veins my own received the warm ,</l>
     <l n="174">Red blood of southern France , which curved my form ,</l>
     <l n="175">And glowed upon my cheek in crimson dyes ,</l>
     <l n="176">And bronzed my hair , and darkled in my eyes .</l>
     <l n="177">And as the morning trails the skirts of night ,</l>
     <l n="178">And dusky night puts on the garb of morn ,</l>
     <l n="179">And walk together when the day is born ,</l>
     <l n="180">So we two glided down the hall and stair ,</l>
     <l n="181">Arm clasping arm , into the parlor , where</l>
     <l n="182">Sat Vivian , bathed in sunset 's gorgeous light .</l>
     <l n="183">He rose to greet us . Oh ! his form was grand ;</l>
     <l n="184">And he possessed that power , strange , occult ,</l>
     <l n="185">Called magnetism , lacking better word ,</l>
     <l n="186">Which moves the world , achieving great result</l>
     <l n="187">Where genius fails completely . Touch his hand ,</l>

     <l n="231">Knee-deep , through clover , to the poplar grove ,</l>

     <l n="235">An easy prey for foxes . “ Chick-a-dee , ”</l>
     <l n="236">Quoth I , while reaching for the downy things</l>

     <l n="247">So like the human mother here again ,</l>
     <l n="248">Moaning because a strong , protecting arm</l>
     <l n="249">Would shield her little ones from cold and harm ,</l>
     <l n="250">I carried back my garden hat brimful</l>
     <l n="251">Of chirping chickens , like white balls of wool ,</l>

     <l n="253">And just then I heard</l>

     <l n="256">And set in motion by a passing breeze .</l>
     <l n="257">‘ T was Helen singing : and , as I drew near ,</l>

     <l n="261">It was a way of Helen 's , not to sing</l>
     <l n="262">The songs that other people sang . She took</l>
     <l n="263">Sometimes an extract from an ancient book ;</l>
     <l n="264">Again some floating , fragmentary thing</l>
     <l n="265">And such she fitted to old melodies ,</l>
     <l n="266">Or else composed the music . One of these</l>
     <l n="267">She sang that night ; and Vivian caught the strain ,</l>

     <l n="28">Labor just suited to her dainty hands .</l>
     <l n="29">That morning she had been at work in wax ,</l>
     <l n="30">Molding a wreath of flowers for my room ,—</l>
     <l n="31">Taking her patterns from the living blows ,</l>
     <l n="32">In all their dewy beauty and sweet bloom ,</l>
     <l n="33">Fresh from my garden . Fuchsia , tulip , rose ,</l>

     <l n="43">To see if any lilies grew in reach .</l>
     <l n="44">Some broken stalks , where flowers late had been ;</l>
     <l n="45">Some buds , with all their beauties folded in ,</l>

     <l n="353">I did not look up , but I knew his gaze</l>
     <l n="354">Was on my face , and that his eyes must see</l>
     <l n="355">The joy I felt almost transfigured me .</l>
     <l n="356">He loves me — loves me ! so the birds kept singing ,</l>
     <l n="357">And all my soul with that sweet strain is ringing .</l>
     <l n="358">If there were added but one drop of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="359">No more my cup would hold : and so , this eve ,</l>
     <l n="360">I made a wish that I might feel his kiss</l>
     <l n="361">Upon my lips , ere yon pale moon should leave</l>
     <l n="362">The stars all lonely , having waned away ,</l>
     <l n="363">Too old and weak and bowed with care to stay . ”</l>

     <l n="364">Her voice sighed into silence . While she spoke</l>
     <l n="365">My heart writhed in me , praying she would cease —</l>
     <l n="366">Each word she uttered falling like a stroke</l>
     <l n="367">On my bare soul . And now a hush like death ,</l>
     <l n="368">Save that ‘ twas broken by a quick-drawn breath ,</l>
     <l n="369">Fell ‘ round me , but brought not the hoped-for peace .</l>
     <l n="370">For when the lash no longer leaves its blows ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="372">She nestled on my bosom like a child .</l>
     <l n="373">And ‘ neath her head my tortured heart throbbed wild</l>
     <l n="374">With pain and pity . She had told her tale —</l>
     <l n="375">Her self-deceiving story to the end .</l>
     <l n="376">How could I look down on her as she lay</l>
     <l n="377">So fair , and sweet , and lily-like , and frail —</l>
     <l n="378">A tender blossom on my breast , and say ,</l>
     <l n="379">“ Nay , you are wrong — you do mistake , dear friend !</l>
     <l n="380">‘ Tis I am loved , not you ” ? Yet that were truth ,</l>
     <l n="381">And she must know it later .</l>
     <l n="382">Should I speak ,</l>
     <l n="383">And spread a ghastly pallor o'er the cheek</l>
     <l n="384">Flushed now with joy ?— And while I , doubting , pondered ,</l>
     <l n="385">She spoke again . “ Maurine ! I oft have wondered</l>
     <l n="386">Why you and Vivian were not lovers . He</l>
     <l n="387">Is all a heart could ask its king to be ;</l>
     <l n="388">And you have beauty , intellect and youth .</l>
     <l n="389">I think it strange you have not loved each other —</l>
     <l n="390">Strange how he could pass by you for another</l>
     <l n="391">Not half so fair or worthy . Yet I know</l>
     <l n="392">A loving Father pre-arranged it so .</l>
     <l n="393">I think my heart has known him all these years ,</l>
     <l n="394">And waited for him . And if when he came</l>
     <l n="395">It had been as a lover of my friend ,</l>
     <l n="396">I should have recognized him , all the same ,</l>
     <l n="397">As my soul-mate , and loved him to the end ,</l>
     <l n="398">Hiding my grief , and forcing back my tears</l>
     <l n="399">Till on my heart , slow dropping , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="400">Unseen they fell , and wore it all away .</l>
     <l n="401">And so a tender Father kept him free ,</l>
     <l n="402">With all the largeness of his love , for me —</l>
     <l n="403">For me , unworthy such a precious gift !</l>
     <l n="404">Yet I will bend each effort of my life</l>
     <l n="405">To grow in grace and goodness , and to lift</l>
     <l n="406">My soul and spirit to his lofty height ,</l>
     <l n="407">So to deserve that holy name , his wife .</l>
     <l n="408">Sweet friend , it fills my whole heart with delight</l>
     <l n="409">To breathe its long hid secret in your ear .</l>
     <l n="410">Speak , my Maurine , and say you love to hear ! ”</l>
     <l n="411">The while she spoke , my active brain gave rise</l>
     <l n="412">To one great thought of mighty sacrifice</l>
     <l n="413">And self-denial . Oh ! it blanched my cheek ,</l>
     <l n="414">And wrung my soul ; and from my heart it drove</l>
     <l n="415">All life and feeling . Coward-like , I strove</l>
     <l n="416">To send it from me ; but I felt it cling</l>
     <l n="417">And hold fast on my mind like some live thing ;</l>
     <l n="418">And all the Self within me felt its touch</l>
     <l n="419">And cried , “ No , no ! I cannot do so much —</l>
     <l n="420">I am not strong enough — there is no call . ”</l>
     <l n="421">And then the voice of Helen bade me speak ,</l>
     <l n="422">And with a calmness born of nerve , I said ,</l>
     <l n="423">Scarce knowing what I uttered , “ Sweetheart , all</l>

     <l n="425">I thank you for your confidence , and pray</l>
     <l n="426">I may deserve it always . But , dear one ,</l>
     <l n="427">Something — perhaps our boat-ride in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="428">Has set my head to aching . I must go</l>
     <l n="429">To bed directly ; and you will , I know ,</l>
     <l n="430">Grant me your pardon , and another day</l>
     <l n="431">We 'll talk of this together . Now good night</l>

     <l n="433">I kissed her lips , and held her on my heart ,</l>
     <l n="434">And viewed her as I ne'er had done before .</l>
     <l n="435">I gazed upon her features o'er and o'er ;</l>
     <l n="436">Marked her white , tender face — her fragile form ,</l>
     <l n="437">Like some frail plant that withers in the storm ;</l>
     <l n="438">Saw she was fairer in her new-found joy</l>
     <l n="439">Than e'er before ; and thought , “ Can I destroy</l>

     <l n="6">Fell on my cheek . As from a deep abyss ,</l>
     <l n="7">I drew my weary self from that strange sleep</l>
     <l n="8">That rests not , nor refreshes . Scarce awake</l>
     <l n="9">Or conscious , yet there seemed a heavy weight</l>
     <l n="10">Bound on my breast , as by a cruel Fate .</l>
     <l n="11">I knew not why , and yet I longed to weep .</l>
     <l n="12">Some dark cloud seemed to hang upon the day ;</l>
     <l n="13">And , for a moment , in that trance I lay ,</l>
     <l n="14">When suddenly the truth did o'er me break ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like some great wave upon a helpless child .</l>
     <l n="16">The dull pain in my breast grew like a knife —</l>
     <l n="17">The heavy throbbing of my heart grew wild ,</l>
     <l n="18">And God gave back the burden of the life</l>
     <l n="19">He kept what time I slumbered .</l>
     <l n="20">“ You are ill , ”</l>

     <l n="31">“ Show Thou me the way ,</l>
     <l n="32">Where duty leads ; for I am blind ! my sight</l>
     <l n="33">Obscured by self . Oh , lead my steps aright !</l>
     <l n="34">Help me see the path : and if it may ,</l>
     <l n="35">Let this cup pass :— and yet Thou heavenly One</l>
     <l n="36">Thy will in all things , not mine own , be done . ”</l>
     <l n="37">Rising , I went upon my way , receiving</l>
     <l n="38">The strength prayer gives alway to hearts believing .</l>
     <l n="39">I felt that unseen hands were leading me ,</l>
     <l n="40">And knew the end was peace .</l>
     <l n="41">“ What ! are you up ? ”</l>
     <l n="42">Cried Helen , coming with a tray , and cup ,</l>
     <l n="43">Of tender toast , and fragrant smoking tea .</l>
     <l n="44">“ You naughty girl ! you should have stayed in bed</l>
     <l n="45">Until you ate your breakfast , and were better</l>
     <l n="46">I 've something hidden for you here — a letter .</l>

     <l n="54">My nurse , than any hunger to appease .</l>
     <l n="55">Then listlessly I broke the seal and read</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="69">So Roy was coming ! He and I had played</l>
     <l n="70">As boy and girl , and later , youth and maid ,</l>
     <l n="71">Full half our lives together . He had been ,</l>
     <l n="72">Like me , an orphan ; and the roof of kin</l>
     <l n="73">Gave both kind shelter . Swift years sped away</l>
     <l n="74">Ere change was felt : and then one summer day</l>
     <l n="75">A long lost uncle sailed from India 's shore —</l>

     <l n="77">“ He 'd write us daily , and we 'd see his face</l>

     <l n="80">Since last he looked upon the olden place .</l>
     <l n="81">He 'd been through college , traveled in all lands ,</l>
     <l n="82">Sailed over seas , and trod the desert sands .</l>
     <l n="83">Would write and plan a visit , then , ere long ,</l>
     <l n="84">Would write again from Egypt or Hong Kong —</l>
     <l n="85">Some fancy called him thither unforeseen .</l>
     <l n="86">So years had passed , till seven lay between</l>
     <l n="87">His going and the coming of this note ,</l>
     <l n="88">Which I hid in my bosom , and replied</l>
     <l n="89">To Aunt Ruth 's queries , “ What the truant wrote ? ”</l>
     <l n="90">By saying he was still upon the wing ,</l>

     <l n="97">Is slowly strangled by remorseless Pain :</l>
     <l n="98">And one stern , cold , relentless , takes its place —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="117">The hours went by , too slow , and yet too fast .</l>

     <l n="282">And , with a slight , proud bending of the head ,</l>

     <l n="387">No words were spoken of rebuke or scorn :</l>

     <l n="393">Free and informal were</l>

     <l n="403">Without reserve or caution . Many a time</l>
     <l n="404">When there was some steep mountain side to climb ,</l>
     <l n="405">And I grew weary , he would say , “ Maurine ,</l>

     <l n="407">My head upon his shoulder , or would stand</l>

     <l n="409">The while he stroked it gently with his own .</l>
     <l n="410">Or I would let him clasp me with his arm ,</l>

     <l n="139">To wait until the Springtime . Roy Montaine</l>
     <l n="140">Would be our guide and escort .</l>
     <l n="141">No one dreamed</l>
     <l n="142">The cause of my strange hurry , but all seemed</l>
     <l n="143">To think good fortune had quite turned my brain .</l>
     <l n="144">One bright October morning , when the woods</l>
     <l n="145">Had donned their purple mantles and red hoods</l>
     <l n="146">In honor of the Frost King , Vivian came ,</l>
     <l n="147">Bringing some green leaves , tipped with crimson flame ,—</l>
     <l n="148">First trophies of the Autumn time .</l>
     <l n="149">And Roy</l>
     <l n="150">Made a proposal that we all should go</l>
     <l n="151">And ramble in the forest for a while .</l>
     <l n="152">But Helen said she was not well — and so</l>
     <l n="153">Must stay at home . Then Vivian , with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="154">Responded , “ I will stay and talk to you ,</l>
     <l n="155">And they may go ; ” at which her two cheeks grew</l>
     <l n="156">Like twin blush roses ;— dyed with love 's red wave ,</l>
     <l n="157">Her fair face shone transfigured with great joy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="158">And Vivian saw — and suddenly was grave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="159">Roy took my arm in that protecting way</l>
     <l n="160">Peculiar to some men , which seems to say ,</l>
     <l n="161">“ I shield my own , ” a manner pleasing , e'en</l>
     <l n="162">When we are conscious that it does not mean</l>
     <l n="163">More than a simple courtesy . A woman</l>
     <l n="164">Whose heart is wholly feminine and human ,</l>
     <l n="165">And not unsexed by hobbies , likes to be</l>
     <l n="166">The object of that tender chivalry ,</l>
     <l n="167">That guardianship which man bestows on her ,</l>
     <l n="168">Yet mixed with deference ; as if she were</l>
     <l n="169">Half child , half angel .</l>
     <l n="170">Though she may be strong ,</l>
     <l n="171">Noble and self-reliant , not afraid</l>
     <l n="172">To raise her hand and voice against all wrong</l>
     <l n="173">And all oppression , yet if she be made ,</l>
     <l n="174">With all the independence of her thought ,</l>
     <l n="175">A woman womanly , as God designed ,</l>
     <l n="176">Albeit she may have as great a mind</l>
     <l n="177">As man , her brother , yet his strength of arm</l>
     <l n="178">His muscle and his boldness she has not ,</l>
     <l n="179">And cannot have without she loses what</l>
     <l n="180">Is far more precious , modesty and grace .</l>
     <l n="181">So , walking on in her appointed place ,</l>
     <l n="182">She does not strive to ape him , nor pretend</l>
     <l n="183">But that she needs him for a guide and friend ,</l>
     <l n="184">To shield her with his greater strength from harm .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="185">We reached the forest ; wandered to and fro</l>
     <l n="186">Through many a winding path and dim retreat .</l>
     <l n="187">Till I grew weary : when I chose a seat</l>
     <l n="188">Upon an oak tree , which had been laid low</l>
     <l n="189">By some wind storm , or by some lightning stroke .</l>
     <l n="190">And Roy stood just below me , where the ledge</l>

     <l n="193">One hand held mine ; the other grasped a limb</l>

     <l n="196">And fixed upon me , silently he gazed</l>
     <l n="197">Until I , smiling , turned to him and spoke :</l>
     <l n="198">“ Give words , my cousin , to those thoughts that rise ,</l>

     <l n="200">The smooth and even darkness of his cheek</l>

     <l n="202">He swayed his lithe form nearer as he stood</l>
     <l n="203">Still clinging to the branch above his head .</l>
     <l n="204">His brilliant eyes grew darker ; and he said ,</l>
     <l n="205">With sudden passion , “ Do you bid me speak ?</l>
     <l n="206">I can not , then , keep silence if I would .</l>
     <l n="207">That hateful fortune , coming as it did ,</l>
     <l n="208">Forbade my speaking sooner ; for I knew</l>
     <l n="209">A harsh tongued world would quickly misconstrue</l>
     <l n="210">My motive for a meaner one . But , sweet ,</l>
     <l n="211">So big my heart has grown with love for you</l>
     <l n="212">I can not shelter it , or keep it hid .</l>
     <l n="213">And so I cast it throbbing at your feet ,</l>

     <l n="215">Maurine , I love you better than my life .</l>
     <l n="216">My friend — my cousin — be still more , my wife !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="218">I scarce could breathe for wonderment ; and numb</l>
     <l n="219">With truth that fell too suddenly , sat dumb</l>

     <l n="221">That looked no feeling but complete surprise .</l>
     <l n="222">He swayed so near his breath was on my cheek .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="224">Then suddenly , as o'er some magic glass</l>
     <l n="225">One picture in a score of shapes will pass ,</l>
     <l n="226">I seemed to see Roy glide before my gaze .</l>
     <l n="227">First , as the playmate of my earlier days —</l>
     <l n="228">Next , as my kin — and then my valued friend ,</l>

     <l n="230">In some unlooked-for group before our eyes ,</l>
     <l n="231">We hold the glass , and look them o'er and o'er</l>
     <l n="232">So now I gazed on Roy in his new guise ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="234">His form was like a panther 's in its grace ,</l>
     <l n="235">So lithe and supple , and of medium height ,</l>
     <l n="236">And garbed in all the elegance of fashion .</l>
     <l n="237">His large black eyes were full of fire and passion ,</l>
     <l n="238">And in expression fearless , firm , and bright .</l>
     <l n="239">His hair was like the very deeps of night ,</l>
     <l n="240">And hung in raven clusters ‘ round a face</l>
     <l n="241">Of dark and flashing beauty .</l>
     <l n="242">He was more</l>
     <l n="243">Like some romantic maiden 's grand ideal</l>
     <l n="244">Than like a common being . As I gazed</l>
     <l n="245">Upon the handsome face to mine upraised ,</l>
     <l n="246">I saw before me , living , breathing , real ,</l>
     <l n="247">The hero of my early day-dreams : though</l>
     <l n="248">So full my heart was with that clear-cut face ,</l>
     <l n="249">Which , all unlike , yet claimed the hero 's place ,</l>
     <l n="250">I had not recognized him so before ,</l>
     <l n="251">Or thought of him , save as a valued friend .</l>
     <l n="252">So now I called him , adding ,</l>
     <l n="253">“ Foolish boy !</l>
     <l n="254">Each word of love you utter aims a blow</l>
     <l n="255">At that sweet trust I had reposed in you .</l>
     <l n="256">I was so certain I had found a true ,</l>
     <l n="257">Steadfast man friend , on whom I could depend ,</l>
     <l n="258">And go on wholly trusting , to the end .</l>
     <l n="259">Why did you shatter my delusion , Roy ,</l>
     <l n="260">By turning to a lover ? ”</l>
     <l n="261">“ Why , indeed !</l>
     <l n="262">Because I loved you more than any brother ,</l>
     <l n="263">Or any friend could love . ” Then he began</l>
     <l n="264">To argue like a lawyer , and to plead</l>
     <l n="265">With all his eloquence . And , listening ,</l>
     <l n="266">I strove to think it was a goodly thing</l>
     <l n="267">To be so fondly loved by such a man ,</l>
     <l n="268">And it were best to give his wooing heed ,</l>
     <l n="269">And not deny him . Then before my eyes</l>
     <l n="270">In all its clear-cut majesty , that other</l>
     <l n="271">Haughty and poet-handsome face would rise</l>
     <l n="272">And rob my purpose of all life and strength .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="273">Roy urged and argued , as Roy only could ,</l>
     <l n="274">With that impetuous , boyish eloquence .</l>
     <l n="275">He held my hands , and vowed I must , and should</l>
     <l n="276">Give some least hope ; till , in my own defense ,</l>
     <l n="277">I turned upon him , and replied at length :</l>

     <l n="285">A river rolls between us , dark and deep .</l>
     <l n="286">To cross it — were to stain with blood my hand .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="299">He took my hand , and helped me to arise ,</l>

     <l n="301">Where passion 's fires had , sudden , ceased to burn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="302">“ And so , ” he said , “ too soon and unforeseen</l>
     <l n="303">My friendship melted into love , Maurine .</l>
     <l n="304">But , sweet ! I am not wholly in the blame ,</l>
     <l n="305">For what you term my folly . You forgot ,</l>
     <l n="306">So long we 'd known each other , I had not</l>
     <l n="307">In truth a brother 's or a cousin 's claim .</l>
     <l n="308">But I remembered , when through every nerve</l>
     <l n="309">Your lightest touch went thrilling ; and began</l>
     <l n="310">To love you with that human love of man</l>
     <l n="311">For comely woman . By your coaxing arts ,</l>
     <l n="312">You won your way into my heart of hearts ,</l>
     <l n="313">And all Platonic feelings put to rout .</l>
     <l n="314">A maid should never lay aside reserve</l>
     <l n="315">With one who 's not her kinsman , out and out .</l>
     <l n="316">But as we now , with measured steps , retrace</l>
     <l n="317">The path we came , e'en so my heart I 'll send ,</l>
     <l n="318">At your command , back to the olden place ,</l>
     <l n="319">And strive to love you only as a friend . ”</l>
     <l n="320">I felt the justice of his mild reproof ,</l>
     <l n="321">But answered laughing , “ ‘ Tis the same old cry :</l>
     <l n="322">‘ The woman tempted me , and I did eat . ’</l>
     <l n="323">Since Adam 's time we 've heard it . But I 'll try</l>
     <l n="324">And be more prudent , sir , and hold aloof</l>
     <l n="325">The fruit I never once had thought so sweet</l>

     <l n="330">Then I turned away</l>
     <l n="331">And sought my room , low humming some old air</l>
     <l n="332">That ceased upon the threshold ; for mine eyes</l>

     <l n="334">All other senses , merged in that of sight ,</l>
     <l n="335">Were lost in contemplation of the bright</l>
     <l n="336">And wond'rous picture , which had otherwise</l>
     <l n="337">Made dim my vision .</l>
     <l n="338">Waiting in my room ,</l>
     <l n="339">Her whole face lit as by an inward flame</l>
     <l n="340">That shed its halo ‘ round her , Helen stood ;</l>
     <l n="341">Her fair hands folded like a lily 's leaves</l>
     <l n="342">Weighed down by happy dews of summer eves .</l>
     <l n="343">Upon her cheek the color went and came</l>
     <l n="344">As sunlight flickers o'er a bed of bloom ;</l>
     <l n="345">And , like some slim young sapling of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="346">Her slender form leaned slightly ; and her hair</l>
     <l n="347">Fell ‘ round her loosely , in long curling strands</l>
     <l n="348">All unconfined , and as by loving hands</l>
     <l n="349">Tossed into bright confusion .</l>
     <l n="350">Standing there ,</l>
     <l n="351">Her starry eyes uplifted , she did seem</l>
     <l n="352">Like some unearthly creature of a dream ;</l>
     <l n="353">Until she started forward , gliding slowly ,</l>
     <l n="354">And broke the breathless silence , speaking lowly ,</l>
     <l n="355">As one grown meek , and humble in an hour ,</l>
     <l n="356">Bowing before some new and mighty power .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="357">“ Maurine , Maurine ! ” she murmured , and again ,</l>
     <l n="358">“ Maurine , my own sweet friend , Maurine ! ”</l>
     <l n="359">And then ,</l>
     <l n="360">Laying her love light hands upon my head ,</l>
     <l n="361">She leaned , and looked into my eyes , and said</l>

     <l n="363">As winds that blow across a garden bed</l>
     <l n="364">Are weighed with fragrance , “ He is mine alone ,</l>
     <l n="365">And I am his — all his — his very own .</l>
     <l n="366">So pledged this hour , by that most sacred tie</l>
     <l n="367">Save one beneath God 's over-arching sky .</l>
     <l n="368">I could not wait to tell you of my bliss :</l>

     <l n="370">So hiding my heart 's trouble with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="371">I leaned and kissed her dainty mouth ; the while</l>
     <l n="372">I felt a guilt-joy , as of some sweet sin ,</l>
     <l n="373">When my lips fell where his so late had been .</l>
     <l n="374">And all day long I bore about with me</l>
     <l n="375">A sense of shame — yet mixed with satisfaction ,</l>
     <l n="376">As some starved child might steal a loaf , and be</l>
     <l n="377">Sad with the guilt resulting from her action ,</l>
     <l n="378">While yet the morsel in her mouth was sweet .</l>
     <l n="379">That ev'ning when the house had settled down</l>

     <l n="381">A lithe young form , robed in a long white gown :</l>
     <l n="382">With steps like fall of thistle-down she came ,</l>
     <l n="383">Her mouth smile-wreathed ; and , breathing low my name ,</l>

     <l n="404">‘ Dear eyes , you cannot veil the truth from sight .</l>
     <l n="405">You love me , Helen ! answer , is it so ? ’</l>
     <l n="406">And I made answer straightway , ‘ With my life</l>

     <l n="427">A milder , yet a faithful love to you .</l>
     <l n="428">Just as some evil fortune might befall</l>
     <l n="429">A man 's great riches , causing him to live</l>
     <l n="430">In some low cot , all unpretending , still</l>
     <l n="431">As much his home — as much his loved retreat ,</l>
     <l n="432">As was the princely palace on the hill ,</l>
     <l n="433">E'en so I give you all that 's left , my sweet !</l>
     <l n="434">Of my heart-fortune . ’</l>
     <l n="435">‘ That were more to me , ’</l>

     <l n="438">Our faith was pledged . But Vivian would not go</l>
     <l n="439">Until I vowed to wed him New Year day .</l>
     <l n="440">And I am sad because you go away</l>
     <l n="441">Before that time . I shall not feel half wed</l>
     <l n="442">Without you here . Postpone your trip and stay ,</l>
     <l n="443">And be my bridesmaid . ”</l>
     <l n="444">“ Nay , I cannot , dear !</l>
     <l n="445">‘ Twould disarrange our plans for half a year .</l>
     <l n="446">I 'll be in Europe New Year day , ” I said ,</l>

     <l n="448">And from my soul thanked Providence for sparing</l>

     <l n="450">The festal garments of a wedding scene ,</l>
     <l n="451">While all my heart was hung with sorrow 's sable .</l>
     <l n="452">Forgetting for a season , that between</l>

     <l n="454">I lived in my near future , confident</l>
     <l n="455">All would be as I planned it ; and , across</l>
     <l n="456">The briny waste of waters , I should find</l>
     <l n="457">Some balm and comfort for my troubled mind .</l>
     <l n="458">The sad Fall days , like maidens auburn-tressed</l>
     <l n="459">And amber-eyed , in purple garments dressed ,</l>
     <l n="460">Passed by , and dropped their tears upon the tomb</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="462">Roy left us for a time , and Helen went</l>
     <l n="463">To make the nuptial preparations . Then ,</l>
     <l n="464">Aunt Ruth complained one day of feeling ill :</l>
     <l n="465">Her veins ran red with fever ; and the skill</l>
     <l n="466">Of two physicians could not stem the tide .</l>
     <l n="467">The house , that rang so late with laugh and jest ,</l>
     <l n="468">Grew ghostly with low whispered sounds ; and when</l>
     <l n="469">The Autumn day , that I had thought to be</l>
     <l n="470">Bounding upon the billows of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="471">Came sobbing in , it found me pale and worn ,</l>
     <l n="472">Striving to keep away that unloved guest</l>

     <l n="474">Through all the anxious weeks I watched beside</l>

     <l n="477">Brought strength and comfort , by his cheerful face ,</l>
     <l n="478">And hopeful words , that fell in that sad place</l>
     <l n="479">Like rays of light upon a darkened way .</l>
     <l n="480">November passed ; and Winter , crisp and chill ,</l>
     <l n="481">In robes of ermine walked on plain and hill .</l>
     <l n="482">Returning light and life dispelled the gloom</l>
     <l n="483">That cheated Death had brought us from the tomb .</l>
     <l n="484">Aunt Ruth was saved , and slowly getting better —</l>
     <l n="485">Was dressed each day , and walked about the room .</l>
     <l n="486">Then came one morning in the Eastern mail ,</l>
     <l n="487">A little white-winged birdling of a letter .</l>
     <l n="488">I broke the seal and read ,</l>
     <l n="489">“ Maurine , my own !</l>
     <l n="490">I hear Aunt Ruth is better , and am glad .</l>

     <l n="500">Come , if you can , just two weeks from to-day ,</l>
     <l n="501">And make your preparations here . My sweet !</l>
     <l n="502">Indeed I am not glad Aunt Ruth was ill —</l>
     <l n="503">I 'm sorry she has suffered so ; and still</l>
     <l n="504">I 'm thankful something happened , so you stayed .</l>
     <l n="505">I 'm sure my wedding would be incomplete</l>
     <l n="506">Without your presence . Selfish , I 'm afraid</l>
     <l n="507">You 'll think your Helen . But I love you so ,</l>

     <l n="512">Then the pain</l>
     <l n="513">That , hidden under later pain and care ,</l>
     <l n="514">Had made no moan , but silent , seemed to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="515">Woke from its trance-like lethargy , to steep</l>

     <l n="527">To brighten up the convalescent 's room .</l>
     <l n="528">But now the servant only brought a line</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There was a week of bustle and of hurry ;</l>
     <l n="2">A stately home echoed to voices sweet ,</l>
     <l n="3">Calling , replying ; and to tripping feet</l>
     <l n="4">Of busy bridesmaids , running to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="5">With all that girlish fluttering and flurry</l>
     <l n="6">Preceding such occasions .</l>
     <l n="7">Helen 's room</l>
     <l n="8">Was like a lily-garden , all in bloom ,</l>
     <l n="9">Decked with the dainty robes of her trousseau .</l>
     <l n="10">My robe was fashioned by swift , skillful hands —</l>
     <l n="11">A thing of beauty , elegant and rich ,</l>
     <l n="12">A mystery of loopings , puffs and bands ;</l>
     <l n="13">And as I watched it growing , stitch by stitch ,</l>
     <l n="14">I felt as one might feel who should behold</l>
     <l n="15">With vision trance-like , where his body lay</l>
     <l n="16">In deathly slumber , simulating clay ,</l>
     <l n="17">His grave-cloth sewed together , fold on fold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="18">I lived with ev'ry nerve upon the strain ,</l>

     <l n="21">Grew ghastly with its horrors , was concealed</l>
     <l n="22">From mortal eyes by superhuman power ,</l>
     <l n="23">That God bestowed upon me , hour by hour .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="24">What night the Old Year gave unto the New</l>
     <l n="25">The key of human happiness and woe ,</l>
     <l n="26">The pointed stars , upon their field of blue ,</l>
     <l n="27">Shone , white and perfect , o'er a world below ,</l>
     <l n="28">Of snow-clad beauty ; all the trees were dressed</l>
     <l n="29">In gleaming garments , decked with diadems ,</l>
     <l n="30">Each seeming like a bridal-bidden guest ,</l>
     <l n="31">Coming o'erhYpppHeNladen with a gift of gems .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="32">The bustle of the dressing room ; the sound</l>
     <l n="33">Of eager voices in discourse ; the clang</l>
     <l n="34">Of “ sweet bells jangled ” ; thud of steel-clad feet</l>
     <l n="35">That beat swift music on the frozen ground —</l>
     <l n="36">All blent together in my brain , and rang</l>
     <l n="37">A medley of strange noises , incomplete ,</l>
     <l n="38">And full of discords .</l>
     <l n="39">Then out on the night</l>
     <l n="40">Streamed from this open vestibule , a light</l>
     <l n="41">That lit the velvet blossoms which we trod ,</l>
     <l n="42">With all the hues of those that deck the sod .</l>
     <l n="43">The grand cathedral windows were ablaze</l>
     <l n="44">With gorgeous colors ; through a sea of bloom ,</l>
     <l n="45">Up the long aisle , to join the waiting groom ,</l>
     <l n="46">The bridal cortege passed .</l>
     <l n="47">As some lost soul</l>
     <l n="48">Might surge on with the curious crowd , to gaze</l>
     <l n="49">Upon its coffined body , so I went</l>
     <l n="50">With that glad festal throng . The organ sent</l>
     <l n="51">Great waves of melody along the air ,</l>
     <l n="52">That broke and fell , in liquid drops , like spray ,</l>
     <l n="53">On happy hearts that listened . But to me</l>
     <l n="54">It sounded faintly , as if miles away ,</l>
     <l n="55">A troubled spirit , sitting in despair</l>
     <l n="56">Beside the sad and ever-moaning sea ,</l>
     <l n="57">Gave utterance to sighing sounds of dole .</l>
     <l n="58">We paused before the altar . Framed in flowers ,</l>
     <l n="59">The white-robed man of God stood forth .</l>
     <l n="60">I heard</l>
     <l n="61">The solemn service open ; through long hours</l>
     <l n="62">I seemed to stand and listen , while each word</l>
     <l n="63">Fell on my ear as falls the sound of clay</l>
     <l n="64">Upon the coffin of the worshiped dead .</l>
     <l n="65">The stately father gave the bride away :</l>
     <l n="66">The bridegroom circled with a golden band</l>
     <l n="67">The taper finger of her dainty hand .</l>
     <l n="68">The last imposing , binding words were said —</l>
     <l n="69">“ What God has joined let no man put asunder ” —</l>
     <l n="70">And all my strife with self was at an end ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="72">How strangely , in some awful hour of pain ,</l>
     <l n="73">External trifles with our sorrows blend !</l>
     <l n="74">I never hear the mighty organ 's thunder ,</l>
     <l n="75">I never catch the scent of heliotrope ,</l>
     <l n="76">Nor see stained windows all ablaze with light ,</l>
     <l n="77">Without that dizzy whirling of the brain ,</l>
     <l n="78">And all the ghastly feeling of that night ,</l>
     <l n="79">When my sick heart relinquished love and hope .</l>

     <l n="97">Day by day ,</l>

     <l n="134">Wrapped in gloom ,</l>

     <l n="153">Pale spectres of the past , with folded wings ,</l>

     <l n="71">My mind</l>

     <l n="77">Could give me ties of family and home ;</l>
     <l n="78">And then , perhaps , my mind was not above</l>
     <l n="79">Setting some value on a titled name —</l>

     <l n="81">Then my art</l>

     <l n="88">With neither home nor children .</l>
     <l n="89">Once a wife ,</l>

     <l n="98">Until at last my torpid heart awoke ,</l>
