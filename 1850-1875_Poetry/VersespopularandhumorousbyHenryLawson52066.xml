     <l n="14">Where the might of a world-wide ocean</l>

    <head>THE THREE KINGS [ A ]</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">[ A ] Three sea-girt pinnacles off North Cape , New Zealand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">The East is dead and the West is done , and again our course lies thus :—</l>
     <l n="3">South-east by Fate and the Rising Sun where the Three Kings wait for us .</l>
     <l n="4">When our hearts are young and the world is wide , and the heights seem grand</l>
     <l n="5">to climb —</l>
     <l n="6">We are off and away to the Sydney-side ; but the Three Kings bide their</l>
     <l n="7">time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">‘ I ’ ve been to the West ,’ the digger said : he was bearded , bronzed and old ;</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Ah , the smothering curse of the East is wool , and the curse of the West is</l>
     <l n="10">gold .</l>
     <l n="11">‘ I went to the West in the golden boom , with Hope and a life-long mate ,</l>
     <l n="12">‘ They sleep in the sand by the Boulder Soak , and long may the Three Kings</l>
     <l n="13">wait .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">‘ I ’ ve had my fling on the Sydney-side ,’ said a black-sheep to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Let the young fool learn when he can ’ t be taught : I ’ ve learnt what ’ s good</l>
     <l n="16">for me .’</l>
     <l n="17">And he gazed ahead on the sea-line dim — grown dim in his softened eyes —</l>
     <l n="18">With a pain in his heart that was good for him — as he saw the Three Kings</l>
     <l n="19">rise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">A pale girl sits on the foc ’ sle head — she is back , Three Kings ! so soon ;</l>
     <l n="21">But it seems to her like a life-time dead since she fled with him ‘ saloon .’</l>
     <l n="22">There is refuge still in the old folks ’ arms for the child that loved too</l>
     <l n="23">well ;</l>
     <l n="24">They will hide her shame on the Southern farm — and the Three Kings will not</l>
     <l n="25">tell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">’ Twas a restless heart on the tide of life , and a false star in the skies</l>
     <l n="27">That led me on to the deadly strife where the Southern London lies ;</l>
     <l n="28">But I dream in peace of a home for me , by a glorious southern sound ,</l>
     <l n="29">As the sunset fades from a moonlit sea , and the Three Kings show us round .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Our hearts are young and the old hearts old , and life on the farms is slow , And away in the world there is fame and gold — and the Three Kings watch us go . Our heads seem wise and the world seems wide , and its heights are ours to climb , So it ’ s off and away in our youthful pride — but the Three Kings bide our time .</p>
   <p>THE OUTSIDE TRACK</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There were ten of us there on the moonlit quay ,</l>
     <l n="2">And one on the for ’ ard hatch ;</l>
     <l n="3">No straighter mate to his mates than he</l>
     <l n="4">Had ever said : ‘ Len ’ s a match !’</l>
     <l n="5">’ Twill be long , old man , ere our glasses clink ,</l>
     <l n="6">’ Twill be long ere we grip your hand !—</l>
     <l n="7">And we dragged him ashore for a final drink</l>
     <l n="8">Till the whole wide world seemed grand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">For they marry and go as the world rolls back ,</l>
     <l n="10">They marry and vanish and die ;</l>
     <l n="11">But their spirit shall live on the Outside Track</l>
     <l n="12">As long as the years go by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">The port-lights glowed in the morning mist</l>
     <l n="14">That rolled from the waters green ;</l>
     <l n="15">And over the railing we grasped his fist</l>
     <l n="16">As the dark tide came between .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">We cheered the captain and cheered the crew ,</l>
     <l n="18">And our mate , times out of mind ;</l>
     <l n="19">We cheered the land he was going to</l>
     <l n="20">And the land he had left behind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">We roared Lang Syne as a last farewell ,</l>
     <l n="22">But my heart seemed out of joint ;</l>
     <l n="23">I well remember the hush that fell</l>
     <l n="24">When the steamer had passed the point</l>
     <l n="25">We drifted home through the public bars ,</l>
     <l n="26">We were ten times less by one</l>
     <l n="27">Who sailed out under the morning stars ,</l>
     <l n="28">And under the rising sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="29">And one by one , and two by two ,</l>

     <l n="451">The coarse wild scrub on the homestead path ,</l>
     <l n="452">And saw young trees by the chimney growing ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="68">
     <l n="454">He wildly thought of the evil courses</l>

     <l n="457">The felon ’ s dock with its lasting shame .</l>
     <l n="458">‘ Ah , God ! Ah , God ! is there then no pardon ?’</l>
     <l n="459">He cried in a voice that was strained and hoarse ;</l>
     <l n="460">He fell on the weeds that were once a garden ,</l>
     <l n="461">And sobbed aloud in his great remorse .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="69">
     <l n="462">But grief must end , and his heart ceased aching</l>

     <l n="55">With Freedom of Contract maintained in his shed ,</l>

     <l n="58">And his views be inclined to the dark side of life .</l>
     <l n="59">The Truth must be spread and the Cause must be shored —</l>
     <l n="60">But it ’ s just a bit rough on the Boss-of-the-board .</l>
     <l n="61">I am all for the Right ,</l>

     <l n="46">And Jim exclaimed : ‘ You can smoke , you chaps , but me — Gor ’ bli ’ me , no !</l>

     <l n="53">And long years after the war was past , they told in the town and bush</l>
     <l n="54">How the ridge of death to the bloody last was held by a Sydney push ;</l>
     <l n="55">How they fought to the end in a sheet of flame , how they fought with their</l>

     <l n="62">back !’</l>
     <l n="63">When we burst the enemy ’ s ironclads and won by a run of luck ,</l>
     <l n="64">We whooped as loudly as Nelson ’ s lads when a French three-decker struck ;</l>
     <l n="65">And when the enemy ’ s troops prevailed the truth was never heard —</l>

     <l n="67">You bushmen sneer in the old bush way at the newchum jackeroo ,</l>

     <l n="72">We buried his bits in the rear that night for the honour of George-street</l>
     <l n="73">men .</l>
     <l n="74">And Jim the Ringer — he fought , he did . The regiment nicknamed Jim ,</l>
     <l n="75">‘ Old Heads a Caser ’ and ‘ Heads a Quid ,’ but it never was ‘ tails ’ with him .</l>
     <l n="76">The way that he rode was a racing rhyme , and the way that he finished</l>
     <l n="77">grand ;</l>
     <l n="78">He backed the enemy every time , and died in a hand-to-hand !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="79">I ’ ll never forget when the ringer and I were first in the Bush Brigade ,</l>
     <l n="80">With Warrego Bill , from the Live-till-you-Die , in the last grand charge we</l>
     <l n="81">made .</l>
     <l n="82">And Billy died — he was full of sand — he said , as I raised his head :</l>
     <l n="83">‘ I ’ m full of love for my native land , but a lot too full of lead .</l>
     <l n="84">Tell ’ em ,’ said Billy , ‘ and tell old dad , to look after the cattle pup ;’</l>
     <l n="85">But his eyes grew bright , though his voice was sad , and he said , as I held</l>
     <l n="86">him up :</l>
     <l n="87">‘ I have been happy on western farms . And once , when I first went wrong ,</l>
     <l n="88">Around my neck were the trembling arms of the girl I ’ d loved so long .</l>
     <l n="89">Far out on the southern seas I ’ ve sailed , and ridden where brumbies roam ,</l>
     <l n="90">And oft , when all on the station failed , I ’ ve driven the outlaw home .</l>
     <l n="91">I ’ ve spent a cheque in a day and night , and I ’ ve made a cheque as quick ;</l>
     <l n="92">I struck a nugget when times were tight , and the stores had stopped our</l>
     <l n="93">tick .</l>
     <l n="94">I ’ ve led the field on the old bay mare , and I hear the cheering still ,</l>
     <l n="95">When mother and sister and she were there , and the old man yelled for</l>
     <l n="96">Bill ;</l>
     <l n="97">But , save for her , could I live my while again in the old bush way ,</l>
     <l n="98">I ’ d give it all for the last half-mile in the race we rode to-day !’</l>
     <l n="99">And he passed away as the stars came out — he died as old heroes die —</l>
     <l n="100">I heard the sound of the distant rout , and the Southern Cross was high .</l>

     <l n="6">His frock-coat is green and the nap is no more ,</l>

     <l n="24">An odd sense of respect — born of whisky no doubt —</l>
     <l n="25">For the life that was fifty years dead .</l>

     <l n="29">In a new fashioned bar to dead loves and dead friends</l>

    <head>THE SONG OF THE DARLING RIVER</head>
    <head>The only national work of the blacks was a dam or dyke of stones across the Darling River at Brewarrina . The stones they carried from Lord knows where — and the Lord knows how . The people of Bourke kept up navigation for months above the town by a dam of sand-bags . The Darling rises in blazing droughts from the Queensland rains .

    <head>A MAY NIGHT ON THE MOUNTAINS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">’ Tis a wonderful time when these hours begin ,</l>
     <l n="2">These long ‘ small hours ’ of night ,</l>
     <l n="3">When grass is crisp , and the air is thin ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the stars come close and bright .</l>
     <l n="5">The moon hangs caught in a silvery veil ,</l>
     <l n="6">From clouds of a steely grey ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the hard , cold blue of the sky grows pale</l>
     <l n="8">In the wonderful Milky Way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">There is something wrong with this star of ours ,</l>
     <l n="10">A mortal plank unsound ,</l>
     <l n="11">That cannot be charged to the mighty powers</l>
     <l n="12">Who guide the stars around .</l>
     <l n="13">Though man is higher than bird or beast ,</l>
     <l n="14">Though wisdom is still his boast ,</l>
     <l n="15">He surely resembles Nature least ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the things that vex her most .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Oh , say , some muse of a larger star ,</l>
     <l n="18">Some muse of the Universe ,</l>
     <l n="19">If they who people those planets far</l>
     <l n="20">Are better than we , or worse ?</l>
     <l n="21">Are they exempted from deaths and births ,</l>
     <l n="22">And have they greater powers ,</l>
     <l n="23">And greater heavens , and greater earths ,</l>
     <l n="24">And greater Gods than ours ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Are our lies theirs , and our truth their truth ,</l>
     <l n="26">Are they cursed for pleasure ’ s sake ,</l>
     <l n="27">Do they make their hells in their reckless youth</l>
     <l n="28">Ere they know what hells they make ?</l>
     <l n="29">And do they toil through each weary hour</l>
     <l n="30">Till the tedious day is o ’ er ,</l>
     <l n="31">For food that gives but the fleeting power</l>
     <l n="32">To toil and strive for more ?</l>

     <l n="1">On suburban railway stations — you may see them as you pass —</l>
     <l n="2">There are signboards on the platforms saying , ‘ Wait here second class ;’</l>
     <l n="3">And to me the whirr and thunder and the cluck of running gear</l>
     <l n="4">Seem to be for ever saying , saying ‘ Second class wait here ’—</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Wait here second class ,</l>
     <l n="6">Second class wait here .’</l>
     <l n="7">Seem to be for ever saying , saying ‘ Second class wait here .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">And the second class were waiting in the days of serf and prince ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the second class are waiting — they ’ ve been waiting ever since .</l>
     <l n="10">There are gardens in the background , and the line is bare and drear ,</l>
     <l n="11">Yet they wait beneath a signboard , sneering ‘ Second class wait here .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">I have waited oft in winter , in the mornings dark and damp ,</l>
     <l n="13">When the asphalt platform glistened underneath the lonely lamp .</l>
     <l n="14">Ghastly on the brick-faced cutting ‘ Sellum ’ s Soap ’ and ‘ Blower ’ s Beer ;’</l>
     <l n="15">Ghastly on enamelled signboards with their ‘ Second class wait here .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">And the others seemed like burglars , slouched and muffled to the throats ,</l>
     <l n="17">Standing round apart and silent in their shoddy overcoats ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the wind among the wires , and the poplars bleak and bare ,</l>
     <l n="19">Seemed to be for ever snarling , snarling ‘ Second class wait there .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">Out beyond the further suburb , ’ neath a chimney stack alone ,</l>
     <l n="21">Lay the works of Grinder Brothers , with a platform of their own ;</l>
     <l n="22">And I waited there and suffered , waited there for many a year ,</l>
     <l n="23">Slaved beneath a phantom signboard , telling our class to wait here .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="24">Ah ! a man must feel revengeful for a boyhood such as mine .</l>
     <l n="25">God ! I hate the very houses near the workshop by the line ;</l>
     <l n="26">And the smell of railway stations , and the roar of running gear ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the scornful-seeming signboards , saying ‘ Second class wait here .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="28">There ’ s a train with Death for driver , which is ever going past ,</l>
     <l n="29">And there are no class compartments , and we all must go at last</l>
     <l n="30">To the long white jasper platform with an Eden in the rear ;</l>
     <l n="31">And there won ’ t be any signboards , saying ‘ Second class wait here .’</l>

    <head>MY LITERARY FRIEND</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Once I wrote a little poem which I thought was very fine ,</l>
     <l n="2">And I showed the printer ’ s copy to a critic friend of mine ,</l>
     <l n="3">First he praised the thing a little , then he found a little fault ;</l>
     <l n="4">‘ The ideas are good ,’ he muttered , ‘ but the rhythm seems to halt .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">So I straighten ’ d up the rhythm where he marked it with his pen ,</l>
     <l n="6">And I copied it and showed it to my clever friend again .</l>
     <l n="7">‘ You ’ ve improved the metre greatly , but the rhymes are bad ,’ he said ,</l>
     <l n="8">As he read it slowly , scratching surplus wisdom from his head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">So I worked as he suggested ( I believe in taking time ) ,</l>
     <l n="10">And I burnt the ‘ midnight taper ’ while I straightened up the rhyme .</l>
     <l n="11">‘ It is better now ,’ he muttered , ‘ you go on and you ’ ll succeed ,</l>
     <l n="12">It has got a ring about it — the ideas are what you need .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">So I worked for hours upon it ( I go on when I commence ) ,</l>
     <l n="14">And I kept in view the rhythm and the jingle and the sense ,</l>
     <l n="15">And I copied it and took it to my solemn friend once more —</l>
     <l n="16">It reminded him of something he had somewhere read before .</l>

     <l n="17">Now the people say I ’ d never put such horrors into print</l>

     <l n="19">And my dearest friends are certain that I ’ d profit in the end</l>
     <l n="20">If I ’ d always show my copy to a literary friend .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">Then swiftly to the features from a plaited green-hide belt —</l>
     <l n="46">You ’ d have to ring a shed or two to feel as Bogan felt —</l>
     <l n="47">For ’ twas his green-hand picker-up ( who wore a vacant look ) ,</l>
     <l n="48">And Bogan saw the Boss outside consulting with his cook .</l>

     <l n="49">And Bogan Bill was hurt and mad to see that rouseabout ;</l>
     <l n="50">And Bogan laid his ‘ Wolseley ’ down and knocked that rouser out ;</l>
     <l n="51">He knocked him right across the board , he tumbled through the shoot —</l>

     <l n="53">The rouser squints along the pens , he squints along the shoots ,</l>

   <p>‘ Rouseabout ’ and ‘ picker-up ’ are interchangeable terms in above rhymes , as also ‘ boss ’ and ‘ super ’; the shed-name for the latter is ‘ Boss-over-the-board .’ The shearer is paid by the hundred , the rouser by the week . ‘ Pink ’ em pretty ’: to shear clean to the skin . ‘ Bell-sheep ’: shearers are not supposed to take another sheep out of pen when ‘ Smoke-ho ,’ breakfast or dinner bell goes , but some time themselves to get so many sheep out , and one as the bell goes , which makes more work for the rouser and entrenches on his ‘ smoke-ho ,’ as he must leave his ‘ board ’ clean . Shearers are seldom or never fined now .</p>

    <head>THE CAPTAIN OF THE PUSH</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As the night was falling slowly down on city , town and bush ,</l>
     <l n="2">From a slum in Jones ’ Alley sloped the Captain of the Push ;</l>
     <l n="3">And he scowled towards the North , and he scowled towards the South ,</l>
     <l n="4">As he hooked his little finger in the corners of his mouth .</l>
     <l n="5">Then his whistle , loud and shrill , woke the echoes of the ‘ Rocks ,’</l>
     <l n="6">And a dozen ghouls came sloping round the corners of the blocks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">There was nought to rouse their anger ; yet the oath that each one swore</l>
     <l n="8">Seemed less fit for publication than the one that went before .</l>
     <l n="9">For they spoke the gutter language with the easy flow that comes</l>
     <l n="10">Only to the men whose childhood knew the brothels and the slums .</l>
     <l n="11">Then they spat in turns , and halted ; and the one that came behind ,</l>
     <l n="12">Spitting fiercely on the pavement , called on Heaven to strike him blind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Let us first describe the captain , bottle-shouldered , pale and thin ,</l>
     <l n="14">For he was the beau-ideal of a Sydney larrikin ;</l>
     <l n="15">E ’ en his hat was most suggestive of the city where we live ,</l>
     <l n="16">With a gallows-tilt that no one , save a larrikin , can give ;</l>
     <l n="17">And the coat , a little shorter than the writer would desire ,</l>
     <l n="18">Showed a more or less uncertain portion of his strange attire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">That which tailors know as ‘ trousers ’— known by him as ‘ bloomin ’ bags ’—</l>
     <l n="20">Hanging loosely from his person , swept , with tattered ends , the flags ;</l>
     <l n="21">And he had a pointed sternpost to the boots that peeped below</l>
     <l n="22">( Which he laced up from the centre of the nail of his great toe ) ,</l>
     <l n="23">And he wore his shirt uncollar ’ d , and the tie correctly wrong ;</l>
     <l n="24">But I think his vest was shorter than should be in one so long .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">And the captain crooked his finger at a stranger on the kerb ,</l>
     <l n="26">Whom he qualified politely with an adjective and verb ,</l>
     <l n="27">And he begged the Gory Bleeders that they wouldn ’ t interrupt</l>
     <l n="28">Till he gave an introduction — it was painfully abrupt —</l>
     <l n="29">‘ Here ’ s the bleedin ’ push , me covey — here ’ s a ( something ) from the bush !</l>
     <l n="30">Strike me dead , he wants to join us !’ said the captain of the push .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Said the stranger : ‘ I am nothing but a bushy and a dunce ;</l>
     <l n="32">But I read about the Bleeders in the WEEKLY GASBAG once :</l>
     <l n="33">Sitting lonely in the humpy when the wind began to “ whoosh ,”</l>
     <l n="34">How I longed to share the dangers and the pleasures of the push !</l>
     <l n="35">Gosh ! I hate the swells and good ’ uns — I could burn ’ em in their beds ;</l>
     <l n="36">I am with you , if you ’ ll have me , and I ’ ll break their blazing heads .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">‘ Now , look here ,’ exclaimed the captain to the stranger from the bush ,</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Now , look here — suppose a feller was to split upon the push ,</l>
     <l n="39">Would you lay for him and fetch him , even if the traps were round ?</l>
     <l n="40">Would you lay him out and kick him to a jelly on the ground ?</l>
     <l n="41">Would you jump upon the nameless — kill , or cripple him , or both ?</l>
     <l n="42">Speak ? or else I ’ ll — SPEAK !’ The stranger answered , ‘ My kerlonial oath !’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">‘ Now , look here ,’ exclamed the captain to the stranger from the bush ,</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Now , look here — suppose the Bleeders let you come and join the push ,</l>
     <l n="45">Would you smash a bleedin ’ bobby if you got the blank alone ?</l>
     <l n="46">Would you break a swell or Chinkie — split his garret with a stone ?</l>
     <l n="47">Would you have a “ moll ” to keep yer — like to swear off work for good ?’</l>
     <l n="48">‘ Yes , my oath !’ replied the stranger . ‘ My kerlonial oath ! I would !’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">‘ Now , look here ,’ exclaimed the captain to that stranger from the bush ,</l>
     <l n="50">‘ Now , look here — before the Bleeders let yer come and join the push ,</l>
     <l n="51">You must prove that you ’ re a blazer — you must prove that you have grit</l>
     <l n="52">Worthy of a Gory Bleeder — you must show your form a bit —</l>
     <l n="53">Take a rock and smash that winder ?’ and the stranger , nothing loth ,</l>
     <l n="54">Took the rock and — smash ! They only muttered ‘ My kerlonial oath !’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">So they swore him in , and found him sure of aim and light of heel ,</l>
     <l n="56">And his only fault , if any , lay in his excessive zeal ;</l>
     <l n="57">He was good at throwing metal , but we chronicle with pain</l>
     <l n="58">That he jumped upon a victim , damaging the watch and chain ,</l>
     <l n="59">Ere the Bleeders had secured them ; yet the captain of the push</l>
     <l n="60">Swore a dozen oaths in favour of the stranger from the bush .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">Late next morn the captain , rising , hoarse and thirsty from his lair ,</l>
     <l n="62">Called the newly-feather ’ d Bleeder , but the stranger wasn ’ t there !</l>
     <l n="63">Quickly going through the pockets of his ‘ bloomin ’ bags ,’ he learned</l>
     <l n="64">That the stranger had been through him for the stuff his ‘ moll ’ had earned ;</l>
     <l n="65">And the language that he muttered I should scarcely like to tell</l>
     <l n="66">( Stars ! and notes of exclamation !! blank and dash will do as well ) .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">In the night the captain ’ s signal woke the echoes of the ‘ Rocks ,’</l>
     <l n="68">Brought the Gory Bleeders sloping thro ’ the shadows of the blocks ;</l>
     <l n="69">And they swore the stranger ’ s action was a blood-escaping shame ,</l>
     <l n="70">While they waited for the nameless , but the nameless never came .</l>
     <l n="71">And the Bleeders soon forgot him ; but the captain of the push</l>

    <head>CONSTABLE M ‘ CARTY ’ S INVESTIGATIONS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Most unpleasantly adjacent to the haunts of lower orders</l>
     <l n="2">Stood a ‘ terrace ’ in the city when the current year began ,</l>
     <l n="3">And a notice indicated there were vacancies for boarders</l>
     <l n="4">In the middle house , and lodgings for a single gentleman .</l>
     <l n="5">Now , a singular observer could have seen but few attractions</l>
     <l n="6">Whether in the house , or ‘ missus , or the notice , or the street ,</l>
     <l n="7">But at last there came a lodger whose appearances and actions</l>
     <l n="8">Puzzled Constable M ‘ Carty , the policeman on the beat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">He ( the single gent ) was wasted almost to emaciation ,</l>
     <l n="10">And his features were the palest that M ‘ Carty ever saw ,</l>
     <l n="11">And these indications , pointing to a past of dissipation ,</l>
     <l n="12">Greatly strengthened the suspicions of the agent of the law .</l>
     <l n="13">He ( the lodger — hang the pronoun ! ) seemed to like the stormy weather ,</l>
     <l n="14">When the elements in battle kept it up a little late ;</l>
     <l n="15">Yet he ’ d wander in the moonlight when the stars were close together ,</l>
     <l n="16">Taking ghostly consolation in a visionary state .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">He would walk the streets at midnight , when the storm-king raised</l>
     <l n="18">his banner ,</l>
     <l n="19">Walk without his old umbrella ,— wave his arms above his head :</l>
     <l n="20">Or he ’ d fold them tight , and mutter , in a wild , disjointed manner ,</l>
     <l n="21">While the town was wrapped in slumber and he should have been in bed .</l>
     <l n="22">Said the constable-on-duty : ‘ Shure , Oi wonther phwat his trade is ?’</l>
     <l n="23">And the constable would watch him from the shadow of a wall ,</l>
     <l n="24">But he never picked a pocket , and he ne ’ er accosted ladies ,</l>
     <l n="25">And the constable was puzzled what to make of him at all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">Now , M ‘ Carty had arrested more than one notorious dodger ,</l>
     <l n="27">He had heard of men afflicted with the strangest kind of fads ,</l>
     <l n="28">But he couldn ’ t fix the station or the business of the lodger ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who at times would chum with cadgers , and at other times with cads .</l>
     <l n="30">And the constable would often stand and wonder how the gory</l>
     <l n="31">Sheol the stranger got his living , for he loafed the time away</l>
     <l n="32">And he often sought a hillock when the sun went down in glory ,</l>
     <l n="33">Just as if he was a mourner at the burial of the day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="34">Mac . had noticed that the lodger did a mighty lot of smoking ,</l>
     <l n="35">And could ‘ stow away a long ’ un ,’ never winking , so he could ;</l>
     <l n="36">And M ‘ Carty once , at midnight , came upon the lodger poking</l>
     <l n="37">Round about suspicious alleys where the common houses stood .</l>
     <l n="38">Yet the constable had seen him in a class above suspicion —</l>
     <l n="39">Seen him welcomed with effusion by a dozen ‘ toney gents ’—</l>
     <l n="40">Seen him driving in the buggy of a rising politician</l>
     <l n="41">Thro ’ the gateway of the member ’ s toney private residence .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="42">And the constable , off duty , had observed the lodger slipping</l>
     <l n="43">Down a lane to where the river opened on the ocean wide ,</l>
     <l n="44">Where he ’ d stand for hours gazing at the distant anchor ’ d shipping ,</l>
     <l n="45">But he never took his coat off , so it wasn ’ t suicide .</l>
     <l n="46">For the constable had noticed that a man who ’ s filled with loathing</l>
     <l n="47">For his selfish fellow-creatures and the evil things that be ,</l>
     <l n="48">Will , for some mysterious reason , shed a portion of his clothing ,</l>
     <l n="49">Ere he takes his first and final plunge into eternity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="50">And M ‘ Carty , once at midnight — be it said to his abasement —</l>
     <l n="51">Left his beat and climbed a railing of considerable height ,</l>
     <l n="52">Just to watch the lodger ’ s shadow on the curtain of his casement</l>
     <l n="53">While the little room was lighted in the listening hours of night .</l>
     <l n="54">Now , at first the shadow hinted that the substance sat inditing ;</l>
     <l n="55">Now it indicated toothache , or the headache ; and again ,</l>
     <l n="56">’ Twould exaggerate the gestures of a dipsomaniac fighting</l>
     <l n="57">Those original conceptions of a whisky-sodden brain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="58">Then the constable , retreating , scratched his head and muttered ‘ Sorra</l>
     <l n="59">Wan of me can undershtand it . But Oi ’ ll keep me Oi on him ,</l>
     <l n="60">Divil take him and his tantrums ; he ’ s a lunatic , begorra !</l>
     <l n="61">Or , if he was up to mischief , he ’ d be sure to douse the glim .’</l>
     <l n="62">But M ‘ Carty wasn ’ t easy , for he had a vague suspicion</l>
     <l n="63">That a ‘ skame ’ was being plotted ; and he thought the matter down</l>
     <l n="64">Till his mind was pretty certain that the business was sedition ,</l>
     <l n="65">And the man , in league with others , sought to overthrow the Crown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="66">But , in spite of observation , Mac . received no information</l>
     <l n="67">And was forced to stay inactive , being puzzled for a charge .</l>
     <l n="68">That the lodger was a madman seemed the only explanation ,</l>
     <l n="69">Tho ’ the house would scarcely harbour such a lunatic at large .</l>
     <l n="70">His appearance failed to warrant apprehension as a vagrant ,</l>
     <l n="71">Tho ’ ’ twas getting very shabby , as the constable could see ;</l>
     <l n="72">But M ‘ Carty in the meantime hoped to catch him in a flagrant</l>
     <l n="73">Breach of peace , or the intention to commit a felony .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="74">( For digression there is leisure , and it is the writer ’ s pleasure</l>

     <l n="77">That there ’ s nothing so elastic as the cruel Vagrant Act )</l>
     <l n="78">Now , M ‘ Carty knew his duty , and was brave as any lion ,</l>
     <l n="79">But he dreaded being ‘ landed ’ in an influential bog —</l>
     <l n="80">As the chances were he would be if the man he had his eye on</l>
     <l n="81">Was a person of importance who was travelling incog .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="82">Want of sleep and over-worry seemed to tell upon M ‘ Carty :</l>
     <l n="83">He was thirsty more than ever , but his appetite resigned ;</l>
     <l n="84">He was previously reckoned as a jolly chap and hearty ,</l>
     <l n="85">But the mystery was lying like a mountain on his mind .</l>
     <l n="86">Tho ’ he tried his best , he couldn ’ t get a hold upon the lodger ,</l>
     <l n="87">For the latter ’ s antecedents weren ’ t known to the police —</l>
     <l n="88">They considered that the ‘ devil ’ was a dark and artful dodger</l>
     <l n="89">Who was scheming under cover for the downfall of the peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="90">’ Twas a simple explanation , though M ‘ Carty didn ’ t know it ,</l>
     <l n="91">Which with half his penetration he might easily have seen ,</l>
     <l n="92">For the object of his dangerous suspicions was a poet ,</l>
     <l n="93">Who was not so widely famous as he thought he should have been .</l>
     <l n="94">And the constable grew thinner , till one morning , ‘ little dhramin ’</l>
     <l n="95">Av the sword of revelation that was leapin ’ from its sheath ,’</l>
     <l n="96">He alighted on some verses in the columns of the FRAYMAN ,</l>
     <l n="97">‘ Wid the christian name an ’ surname av the lodger onderneath !’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="98">Now , M ‘ Carty and the poet are as brother is to brother ,</l>
     <l n="99">Or , at least , as brothers should be ; and they very often meet</l>
     <l n="100">On the lonely block at midnight , and they wink at one another —</l>
     <l n="101">Disappearing down the by-way of a shanty in the street .</l>
     <l n="102">And the poet ’ s name you ’ re asking ?— well , the ground is very tender ,</l>
     <l n="103">You must wait until the public put the gilt upon the name ,</l>
     <l n="104">Till a glorious , sorrow-drowning , and , perhaps , a final ‘ bender ,’</l>
     <l n="105">Heralds his triumphant entrance to the thunder-halls of Fame .</l>

     <l n="3">An ’ they say the local meeting was a drunken rough-and-tumble ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which was ended pretty often by an inquest on the judge .</l>

     <l n="9">Pat M ‘ Durmer was the owner of a horse they called the Screamer ,</l>
     <l n="10">Which he called the ‘ quickest shtepper ’ twixt the Darling and the sea ;’</l>
     <l n="11">And I think it ’ s very doubtful if the stomach-troubled dreamer</l>
     <l n="12">Ever saw a more outrageous piece of equine scenery ;</l>
     <l n="13">For his points were most decided , from his end to his beginning ,</l>
     <l n="14">He had eyes of different colour , and his legs they wasn ’ t mates .</l>

     <l n="18">To put up his horse the Screamer , for he ’ d lose in any case ,</l>
     <l n="19">And they said a city racer by the name of Holy Terror</l>
     <l n="20">Was regarded as the winner of the coming steeplechase ;</l>
     <l n="21">But he said he had the knowledge to come in when it was raining ,</l>
     <l n="22">And irrelevantly mentioned that he knew the time of day ,</l>
     <l n="23">So he rose in their opinion . It was noticed that the training</l>

     <l n="30">Took his dangerous position on the bark-and-sapling stand :</l>
     <l n="31">He was what the local Stiggins used to speak of as a ‘ wessel</l>

     <l n="36">Till the pumping of the Screamer could be heard a mile away .</l>
     <l n="37">But he kept his legs and galloped ; he was used to rugged courses ,</l>
     <l n="38">And he lumbered down the gully till the ridge began to quake :</l>
     <l n="39">And he ploughed along the siding , raising earth till other horses</l>
     <l n="40">An ’ their riders , too , were blinded by the dust-cloud in his wake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">From the ruck he ’ d struggled slowly — they were much surprised to find him</l>
     <l n="42">Close abeam of Holy Terror as along the flat they tore —</l>
     <l n="43">Even higher still and denser rose the cloud of dust behind him ,</l>
     <l n="44">While in more divided splinters flew the shattered rails before .</l>
     <l n="45">‘ Terror !’ ‘ Dead heat !’ they were shouting —‘ Terror !’ but the Screamer hung</l>
     <l n="46">out</l>
     <l n="47">Nose to nose with Holy Terror as across the creek they swung ,</l>
     <l n="48">An ’ M ‘ Durmer shouted loudly , ‘ Put yer tongue out ! put yer tongue out !’</l>
     <l n="49">An ’ the Screamer put his tongue out , and he won by half-a-tongue .</l>

   <p>= The Athenæum = ( London ): “ This is a long way the best work Mr. Lawson has yet given us . These stories are so good that ( from the literary point of view , of course ) one hopes they are not autobiographical . As autobiography they would be good ; as pure fiction they are more of an attainment .”</p>
   <p>= Pall Mall Gazette := “ We can see in these rough diamonds the men who have of late so distinguished themselves at Eland ’ s River and elsewhere .”</p>
   <p>= The Argus := “ More tales of the Joe Wilson series are promised , and this will be gratifying to Mr. Lawson ’ s admirers , for on the whole the sketches are the best work the writer has so far accomplished .”</p>
   <p>= The Academy :=—“ I have never read anything in modern English literature that is so absolutely democratic in tone , so much the real thing , as Joe Wilson ’ s Courtship . And so with all Lawson ’ s tales and sketches . Tolstoy and Howells , and Whitman and Kipling , and Zola and Hauptmann and Gorky have all written descriptions of ‘ democratic ’ life ; but none of these celebrated authors , not even Maupassant himself , has so absolutely taken us inside the life as do the tales Joe Wilson ’ s Courtship and A Double Buggy at Lahey ’ s Creek , and it is this rare convincing tone of this Australian writer that gives him a great value . The most casual ‘ newspapery ’ and apparently artless art of this Australian writer carries with it a truer , finer , more delicate commentary on life than all the idealistic works of any of our genteel school of writers .”</p>

   <p>FRANCIS THOMPSON , in = The Daily Chronicle =: “ He is a writer of strong and ringing ballad verse , who gets his blows straight in , and at his best makes them all tell . He can vignette the life he knows in a few touches , and in this book shows an increased power of selection .”</p>
   <p>= Academy =: “ Mr . Lawson ’ s work should be well known to our readers ; for we have urged them often enough to make acquaintance with it . He has the gift of movement , and he rarely offers a loose rhyme . Technically , short of anxious lapidary work , these verses are excellent . He varies sentiment and humour very agreeably .”</p>
   <p>= New York Evening Journal =: “ Such pride as a man feels when he has true greatness as his guest , this newspaper feels in introducing to a million readers a man of ability hitherto unknown to them . Henry Lawson is his name .”</p>
   <p>= The Book Lover =: “ Any book of Lawson ’ s should be bought and treasured by all who care for the real beginnings of Australian literature . As a matter of fact , he is the one Australian literary product , in any distinctive sense .”</p>

   <p>= Daily Chronicle =: “ Will well sustain the reputation its author has already won as the best writer of Australian short stories and sketches the literary world knows .

     <l n="7">Humour and pathos , comedy and tragedy , are equally at his command .”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>= Glasgow Herald =: “ Mr . Lawson must now be regarded as facile princeps in the production of the short tale . Some of these brief and even slight sketches are veritable gems that would be spoiled by an added word , and without a word that can be looked upon as superfluous .”</p>

Brunton Stephens deserves his place in even the smallest of collections . The chief of Australian poets he has contributed to English literature work of distinguished merit . He is many-sided , embracing all sorts and conditions of men and things .”</p>
   <p>= The Melbourne Argus =: “ Mr . Brunton Stephens has for some years enjoyed an established reputation as one of the best among the small and select cluster of Australian poets .... Mr. Stephens is specially favoured , in that he not only has at command a vein of true pathos , but he has moments of real humour . In more than one poem , too , he has made good his right to be regarded as the poet of brotherhood and the prophet of federation .”</p>
