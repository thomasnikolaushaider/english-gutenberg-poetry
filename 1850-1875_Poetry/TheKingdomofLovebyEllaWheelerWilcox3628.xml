       <l n="2">In the dawn of the day when the sea and the earth</l>
       <l n="3">Reflected the sunrise above ,</l>
       <l n="4">I set forth with a heart full of courage and mirth</l>
       <l n="5">To seek for the Kingdom of Love .</l>
       <l n="6">I asked of a Poet I met on the way</l>
       <l n="7">Which cross-road would lead me aright ;</l>
       <l n="8">And he said “ Follow me , and ere long you shall see</l>
       <l n="9">Its glittering turrets of light . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">And soon in the distance a city shone fair .</l>
       <l n="11">“ Look yonder , ” he said ; “ How it gleams ! ”</l>
       <l n="12">But alas ! for the hopes that were doomed to despair ,</l>
       <l n="13">It was only the “ Kingdom of Dreams . ”</l>
       <l n="14">Then the next man I asked was a gay Cavalier ,</l>
       <l n="15">And he said : “ Follow me , follow me ” ;</l>
       <l n="16">And with laughter and song we went speeding along</l>
       <l n="17">By the shores of Life 's beautiful sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">Then we came to a valley more tropical far</l>
       <l n="19">Than the wonderful vale of Cashmere ,</l>
       <l n="20">And I saw from a bower a face like a flower</l>
       <l n="21">Smile out on the gay Cavalier ;</l>
       <l n="22">And he said : “ We have come to humanity 's goal :</l>
       <l n="23">Here love and delight are intense . ”</l>
       <l n="24">But alas and alas ! for the hopes of my soul —</l>
       <l n="25">It was only the “ Kingdom of Sense . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="26">As I journeyed more slowly I met on the road</l>
       <l n="27">A coach with retainers behind ;</l>
       <l n="28">And they said : “ Follow me , for our Lady 's abode</l>
       <l n="29">Belongs in that realm , you will find . ”</l>
       <l n="30">‘ Twas a grand dame of fashion , a newly-made bride ,</l>
       <l n="31">I followed , encouraged and bold ;</l>
       <l n="32">But my hopes died away like the last gleams of day ,</l>
       <l n="33">For we came to the “ Kingdom of Gold . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="34">At the door of a cottage I asked a fair maid .</l>
       <l n="35">“ I have heard of that realm , ” she replied ;</l>
       <l n="36">“ But my feet never roam from the ‘ Kingdom of Home , ’</l>
       <l n="37">So I know not the way , ” and she sighed .</l>
       <l n="38">I looked on the cottage ; how restful it seemed !</l>
       <l n="39">And the maid was as fair as a dove .</l>
       <l n="40">Great light glorified my soul as I cried :</l>
       <l n="41">“ Why , Home is the ‘ Kingdom of Love ’ ! ”</l>

      <head>MEG 'S CURSE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The sun rode high in a cloudless sky</l>
       <l n="2">Of a perfect summer morn .</l>
       <l n="3">She stood and gazed out into the street ,</l>
       <l n="4">And wondered why she was born .</l>
       <l n="5">On the topmost branch of a maple-tree</l>
       <l n="6">That close by the window grew ,</l>
       <l n="7">A robin called to his mate enthralled :</l>
       <l n="8">“ I love but you , but you , but you . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">A soft look came in her hardened face —</l>
       <l n="10">She had not wept for years ;</l>
       <l n="11">But the robin 's trill , as some sounds will ,</l>
       <l n="12">Jarred open the door of tears .</l>
       <l n="13">She thought of the old home far away ;</l>
       <l n="14">She heard the whr-r-r of the mill ;</l>
       <l n="15">She heard the turtle 's wild , sweet call ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the wail of the whip-poor-will , whip-poor-will , whip-poor-will .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">She saw again that dusty road</l>
       <l n="18">Whence he came riding down ;</l>
       <l n="19">She smelled once more the flower she wore</l>
       <l n="20">In the breast of her simple gown .</l>
       <l n="21">Out on the new-mown meadow she heard</l>
       <l n="22">Two blue-jays quarrel and fret ,</l>
       <l n="23">And the warning cry of a Phoebe bird</l>
       <l n="24">“ More wet , more wet , more wet . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">With a blithe “ Hello ” to the men below</l>
       <l n="26">Who were spreading the new-mown hay ,</l>
       <l n="27">The rider drew rein at her window-pane —</l>
       <l n="28">How it all came back to-day !</l>
       <l n="29">How young she was , and how fair she was ;</l>
       <l n="30">What innocence crowned her brow !</l>
       <l n="31">The future seemed fair , for Love was there —</l>
       <l n="32">And now — and now — and now .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">In a dingy glass on the wall near by</l>
       <l n="34">She gazed on her faded face .</l>
       <l n="35">“ Well , Meg , I declare , what a beauty you are !</l>
       <l n="36">She sneered , “ What an angel of grace !</l>
       <l n="37">Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha !</l>
       <l n="38">What a thing of beauty and grace ! ”</l>
       <l n="39">She reached out her arms with a moaning sob :</l>
       <l n="40">“ Oh , if I could go back ! ”</l>
       <l n="41">Then , swift and strange , came a sudden change ;</l>
       <l n="42">Her brow grew hard and black .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="43">“ A curse on the day and a curse on that man ,</l>
       <l n="44">And on all who are his , ” she cried ;</l>
       <l n="45">“ May he starve and be cold , may he live to be old</l>
       <l n="46">When all who loved him have died . ”</l>
       <l n="47">Her wild voice frightened the robin away</l>
       <l n="48">From the branch by the window-sill ;</l>
       <l n="49">And little he knew as away he flew ,</l>
       <l n="50">Of the memories stirred by his trill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="51">He called to his mate on the grass below ,</l>
       <l n="52">“ Follow me , ” as he soared on high ;</l>
       <l n="53">And as mates have done since the world begun</l>
       <l n="54">She followed , and asked not why .</l>
       <l n="55">The dingy room seemed curtained with gloom ;</l>
       <l n="56">Meg shivered with nameless dread .</l>
       <l n="57">The ghost of her youth and her murdered truth</l>
       <l n="58">Seemed risen up from the dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="59">She hurried out into the noisy street ,</l>
       <l n="60">For the silence made her afraid ;</l>
       <l n="61">To flee from thought was all she sought ,</l>
       <l n="62">She cared not whither she strayed .</l>
       <l n="63">Still on she pressed in her wild unrest</l>
       <l n="64">Up avenues skirting the park ,</l>
       <l n="65">Where fashion 's throng moved gayly along</l>
       <l n="66">In Vanity Fair — when hark !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="67">A clatter of hoofs down the stony street ,</l>
       <l n="68">The snort of a frightened horse</l>
       <l n="69">That was running wild , and a laughing child</l>
       <l n="70">At play in its very course .</l>
       <l n="71">With one swift glance Meg saw it all .</l>
       <l n="72">“ His child — my God ! his child ! ”</l>
       <l n="73">She cried aloud , as she rushed through the crowd</l>
       <l n="74">Like one grown suddenly wild .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="75">There , almost under the iron feet ,</l>
       <l n="76">Hemmed in by a passing cart ,</l>
       <l n="77">Stood the baby boy — the pride and joy</l>
       <l n="78">Of the man who had broken her heart .</l>
       <l n="79">Past swooning women and shouting men</l>
       <l n="80">She fled like a flash of light ;</l>
       <l n="81">With her slender arm she gathered from harm</l>
       <l n="82">The form of the laughing sprite .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="83">The death-shod feet of the mad horse beat</l>
       <l n="84">Her down on the pavings grey ;</l>
       <l n="85">But the baby laughed out with a merry shout ,</l>
       <l n="86">And thought it splendid play .</l>
       <l n="87">He pulled her gown and called to her : “ Say ,</l>
       <l n="88">Dit up and do dat some more ,</l>
       <l n="89">Das jus ’ ze way my papa play</l>
       <l n="90">Wiz me on ze nursery floor . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="91">When the frightened father reached the scene ,</l>
       <l n="92">His boy looked up and smiled</l>
       <l n="93">From the stiffening fold of the arm , death-cold ,</l>
       <l n="94">Of Meg , who had died for his child .</l>
       <l n="95">Oh ! idle words are a woman 's curse</l>
       <l n="96">Who loves as woman can ;</l>
       <l n="97">For put to the test , she will bare her breast</l>
       <l n="98">And die for the sake of the man .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A rose in my garden , the sweetest and fairest ,</l>
       <l n="2">Was hanging her head through the long golden hours ;</l>
       <l n="3">And early one morning I saw her tears falling ,</l>
       <l n="4">And heard a low gossiping talk in the bowers .</l>
       <l n="5">The yellow Nasturtium , a spinster all faded ,</l>
       <l n="6">Was telling a Lily what ailed the poor Rose :</l>
       <l n="7">“ That wild roving Bee who was hanging about her ,</l>

       <l n="4">The queen was wringing her hands and hair ;</l>
       <l n="5">The maids of honour were sad and solemn ;</l>
       <l n="6">The pages looked blank as they stood in column ;</l>
       <l n="7">The court-jester blubbered , “ Boo-hoo , boo-hoo ”</l>
       <l n="8">The cook in the kitchen dropped tears in the stew</l>
       <l n="9">And all through the castle went sob and wail ,</l>
       <l n="10">For the princess had broken her finger-nail :</l>

       <l n="25">As “ How could you hurry a nail to grow ? ”</l>
       <l n="26">And the skill of the kingdom was called to show .</l>
       <l n="27">They sent for Monsieur File - ‘ em-off ;</l>
       <l n="28">He smoothed down the corners so ragged and rough .</l>
       <l n="29">They sent for Madame la Diamond-Dust ,</l>

       <l n="37">Over the kingdom the telegrams flew</l>

       <l n="41">At length the glad tidings were heard with a shout</l>

       <l n="49">And paid his tailor , Don Wait-for-aye ,</l>
       <l n="50">Who died of amazement the self-same day .</l>
       <l n="51">My lord by a jury was judged insane ;</l>

      <head>HOW SALVATOR WON</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The gate was thrown open , I rode out alone ,</l>
       <l n="2">More proud than a monarch who sits on a throne .</l>
       <l n="3">I am but a jockey , yet shout upon shout</l>
       <l n="4">Went up from the people who watched me ride out ;</l>
       <l n="5">And the cheers that rang forth from that warm-hearted crowd ,</l>
       <l n="6">Were as earnest as those to which monarch e'er bowed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">My heart thrilled with pleasure so keen it was pain</l>
       <l n="8">As I patted my Salvator 's soft silken mane ;</l>
       <l n="9">And a sweet shiver shot from his hide to my hand</l>
       <l n="10">As we passed by the multitude down to the stand .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">The great waves of cheering came billowing back ,</l>
       <l n="12">As the hoofs of brave Tenny rang swift down the track ;</l>
       <l n="13">And he stood there beside us , all bone and all muscle ,</l>
       <l n="14">Our noble opponent , well trained for the tussle</l>
       <l n="15">That waited us there on the smooth , shining course .</l>
       <l n="16">My Salvator , fair to the lovers of horse ,</l>
       <l n="17">As a beautiful woman is fair to man 's sight —</l>
       <l n="18">Pure type of the thoroughbred , clean-limbed and bright ,—</l>
       <l n="19">Stood taking the plaudits as only his due ,</l>
       <l n="20">And nothing at all unexpected or new .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="21">And then , there before us the bright flag is spread ,</l>
       <l n="22">There 's a roar from the grand stand , and Tenny 's ahead ;</l>
       <l n="23">At the sound of the voices that shouted “ a go ! ”</l>
       <l n="24">He sprang like an arrow shot straight from the bow .</l>
       <l n="25">I tighten the reins on Prince Charlie 's great son —</l>
       <l n="26">He is off like a rocket , the race is begun .</l>
       <l n="27">Half-way down the furlong , their heads are together ,</l>
       <l n="28">Scarce room ‘ twixt their noses to wedge in a feather ;</l>
       <l n="29">Past grand stand , and judges , in neck-to-neck strife ,</l>
       <l n="30">Ah , Salvator , boy ! ‘ tis the race of your life .</l>
       <l n="31">I press my knees closer , I coax him , I urge ,</l>
       <l n="32">I feel him go out with a leap and a surge ;</l>
       <l n="33">I see him creep on , inch by inch , stride by stride ,</l>
       <l n="34">While backward , still backward , falls Tenny beside .</l>
       <l n="35">We are nearing the turn , the first quarter is past —</l>
       <l n="36">‘ Twixt leader and chaser the daylight is cast .</l>
       <l n="37">The distance elongates , still Tenny sweeps on ,</l>
       <l n="38">As graceful and free-limbed and swift as a fawn ;</l>
       <l n="39">His awkwardness vanished , his muscles all strained —</l>
       <l n="40">A noble opponent , well born and well trained .</l>
       <l n="41">I glanced o'er my shoulder , ha ! Tenny , the cost</l>
       <l n="42">Of that one 's second flagging , will be — the race lost .</l>
       <l n="43">One second 's weak yielding of courage and strength ,</l>
       <l n="44">And the daylight between us has doubled its length .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="45">The first mile is covered , the race is mine — no !</l>
       <l n="46">For the blue blood of Tenny responds to a blow .</l>
       <l n="47">He shoots through the air like a ball from a gun ,</l>
       <l n="48">And the two lengths between us are shortened to one ,</l>
       <l n="49">My heart is contracted , my throat feels a lump ,</l>
       <l n="50">For Tenny 's long neck is at Salvator 's rump ;</l>
       <l n="51">And now with new courage grown bolder and bolder ,</l>
       <l n="52">I see him , once more running shoulder to shoulder .</l>
       <l n="53">With knees , hands , and body I press my grand steed</l>
       <l n="54">I urge him , I coax him , I pray him to heed !</l>
       <l n="55">Oh , Salvator ! Salvator ! list to my calls ,</l>
       <l n="56">For the blow of my whip will hurt both if it falls .</l>
       <l n="57">There 's a roar from the crowd like the ocean in storm</l>
       <l n="58">As close to my saddle leaps Tenny 's great form :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="59">One more mighty plunge , and with knee , limb , and hand ,</l>
       <l n="60">I lift my horse first by a nose past the stand .</l>
       <l n="61">We are under the string now — the great race is done ,</l>
       <l n="62">And Salvator , Salvator , Salvator won !</l>
       <l n="63">Cheer , hoar-headed patriarchs ; cheer loud , I say .</l>
       <l n="64">‘ Tis the race of a century witnessed to-day !</l>
       <l n="65">Though ye live twice the space that 's allotted to men ,</l>
       <l n="66">Ye never will see such a grand race again .</l>
       <l n="67">Let the shouts of the populace roar like the surf</l>
       <l n="68">For Salvator , Salvator , king of the turf !</l>
       <l n="69">He has broken the record of thirteen long years ;</l>
       <l n="70">He has won the first place in a vast line of peers .</l>
       <l n="71">‘ Twas a neck-to-neck contest , a grand , honest race ,</l>
       <l n="72">And even his enemies grant him his place .</l>
       <l n="73">Down into the dust let old records be hurled ,</l>
       <l n="74">And hang out 2. 05 in the gaze of the world .</l>

       <l n="9">Love makes all wisdom seem but poorest folly ,</l>
       <l n="10">And yet the simplest mind with Love grows wise ,</l>
       <l n="11">The gayest heart he teaches melancholy ,</l>
       <l n="12">Yet glorifies the erstwhile brooding eyes .</l>
       <l n="13">Love lives on change , and yet at change Love mocks ,</l>

       <l n="7">She danced ten partners out of breath ;</l>

       <l n="31">She danced and bounded and sprang so far ,</l>
       <l n="32">That she stuck at last on a pointed star ;</l>
       <l n="33">And there she must dance till the Judgment Day ,</l>
       <l n="34">And after it , too , for she danced away</l>
       <l n="35">Her soul , you see , so she has no place anywhere out of space ,</l>

       <l n="3">The little chills run up and down my spine whene'er we meet ,</l>
       <l n="4">Though she seems a gentle creature and she 's very trim and neat .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">And she has a thousand virtues and not one acknowledged sin ,</l>
       <l n="6">But she is the sort of person you could liken to a pin .</l>
       <l n="7">And she pricks you , and she sticks you , in a way that can n't be said —</l>
       <l n="8">When you seek for what has hurt you , why , you cannot find the head .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">She is wonderfully observing . When she meets a pretty girl</l>
       <l n="14">She is always sure to tell her if her “ bang ” is out of curl .</l>
       <l n="15">And she is so sympathetic ; to her friend who 's much admired ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">

       <l n="19">And she said : “ Oh , how becoming ! ” and then softly added , “ It</l>
