    <head>SURRENDER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Love , when we met , ’ twas like two planets meeting .</l>
     <l n="2">Strange chaos followed ; body , soul , and heart</l>
     <l n="3">Seemed shaken , thrilled , and startled by that greeting .</l>
     <l n="4">Old ties , old dreams , old aims , all torn apart</l>
     <l n="5">And wrenched away , left nothing there the while</l>
     <l n="6">But the great shining glory of your smile .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">I knew no past ; ’ twas all a blurred , bleak waste ;</l>
     <l n="8">I asked no future ; ’ twas a blinding glare .</l>
     <l n="9">I only saw the present : as men taste</l>
     <l n="10">Some stimulating wine , and lose all care ,</l>
     <l n="11">I tasted Love ’ s elixir , and I seemed</l>
     <l n="12">Dwelling in some strange land , like one who dreamed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">It was a godlike separate existence ;</l>
     <l n="14">Our world was set apart in some fair clime .</l>
     <l n="15">I had no will , no purpose , no resistance ;</l>
     <l n="16">I only knew I loved you for all time .</l>
     <l n="17">The earth seemed something foreign and afar ,</l>
     <l n="18">And we two , sovereigns dwelling in a star !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">It is so sad , so strange , I almost doubt</l>
     <l n="20">That all those years could be , before we met .</l>
     <l n="21">Do you not wish that we could blot them out ?</l>
     <l n="22">Obliterate them wholly , and forget</l>
     <l n="23">That we had any part in life until</l>
     <l n="24">We clasped each other with Love ’ s rapture thrill ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">My being trembled to its very center</l>
     <l n="26">At that first kiss . Cold Reason stood aside</l>
     <l n="27">With folded arms to let a grand Love enter</l>
     <l n="28">In my Soul ’ s secret chamber to abide .</l>
     <l n="29">Its great High Priest , my first love and my last ,</l>
     <l n="30">There on its altar I consumed my past .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">And all my life I lay upon its shrine</l>
     <l n="32">The best emotions of my heart and brain ,</l>
     <l n="33">Whatever gifts and graces may be mine ;</l>
     <l n="34">No secret thought , no memory I retain ,</l>
     <l n="35">But give them all for dear Love ’ s precious sake ;</l>
     <l n="36">Complete surrender of the whole I make .</l>

    <head>THE BIRTH OF THE OPAL .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Sunbeam loved the Moonbeam ,</l>
     <l n="2">And followed her low and high ,</l>
     <l n="3">But the Moonbeam fled and hid her head ,</l>
     <l n="4">She was so shy — so shy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The Sunbeam wooed with passion ;</l>
     <l n="6">Ah , he was a lover bold !</l>
     <l n="7">And his heart was afire with mad desire</l>
     <l n="8">For the Moonbeam pale and cold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">She fled like a dream before him ,</l>
     <l n="10">Her hair was a shining sheen ,</l>
     <l n="11">And oh , that Fate would annihilate</l>
     <l n="12">The space that lay between !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Just as the day lay panting</l>
     <l n="14">In the arms of the twilight dim ,</l>
     <l n="15">The Sunbeam caught the one he sought</l>
     <l n="16">And drew her close to him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">But out of his warm arms , startled</l>
     <l n="18">And stirred by Love ’ s first shock ,</l>
     <l n="19">She sprang afraid , like a trembling maid ,</l>
     <l n="20">And hid in the niche of a rock .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">And the Sunbeam followed and found her ,</l>
     <l n="22">And led her to Love ’ s own feast ;</l>
     <l n="23">And they were wed on that rocky bed ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the dying Day was their priest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">And lo ! the beautiful Opal —</l>
     <l n="26">That rare and wondrous gem —</l>
     <l n="27">Where the moon and sun blend into one ,</l>
     <l n="28">Is the child that was born to them .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE DIFFERENCE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Passion is what the sun feels for the earth</l>
     <l n="2">When harvests ripen into golden birth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Lust is the hot simoon whose burning breath</l>
     <l n="4">Sweeps o ’ er the fields with devastating death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Passion is what God felt , the Holy One ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who loved the world so , He begot his Son .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">Lust is the impulse Satan peering in</l>
     <l n="8">To Eden had , when he taught Eve to sin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="9">One sprang from light , and one from darkness grew</l>
     <l n="10">How dim the vision that confounds the two !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TWO LOVES .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The woman he loved , while he dreamed of her ,</l>
     <l n="2">Danced on till the stars grew dim ,</l>
     <l n="3">But alone with her heart , from the world apart ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sat the woman who loved him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The woman he worshiped only smiled ,</l>
     <l n="6">When he poured out his passionate love .</l>
     <l n="7">But the other somewhere , kissed her treasure most rare ,</l>
     <l n="8">A book he had touched with his glove .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The woman he loved betrayed his trust ,</l>
     <l n="10">And he wore the scars for life ;</l>
     <l n="11">And he cared not , nor knew , that the other was true ;</l>
     <l n="12">But no man called her his wife .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The woman he loved trod festal halls ,</l>
     <l n="14">While they sang his funeral hymn ,</l>
     <l n="15">But the sad bells tolled , ere the year was old ,</l>
     <l n="16">For the woman who loved him .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE WAY OF IT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This is the way of it , wide world over ,</l>
     <l n="2">One is beloved , and one is the lover ,</l>
     <l n="3">One gives and the other receives .</l>
     <l n="4">One lavishes all in a wild emotion ,</l>
     <l n="5">One offers a smile for a life ’ s devotion ,</l>
     <l n="6">One hopes and the other believes ,</l>
     <l n="7">One lies awake in the night to weep ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the other drifts off in a sweet sound sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">One soul is aflame with a godlike passion ,</l>
     <l n="10">One plays with love in an idler ’ s fashion ,</l>
     <l n="11">One speaks and the other hears .</l>
     <l n="12">One sobs , “ I love you ,” and wet eyes show it ,</l>
     <l n="13">And one laughs lightly , and says “ I know it ,”</l>
     <l n="14">With smiles for the other ’ s tears .</l>
     <l n="15">One lives for the other and nothing beside ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the other remembers the world is wide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">This is the way of it , sad earth over ,</l>
     <l n="18">The heart that breaks is the heart of the lover ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the other learns to forget .</l>
     <l n="20">“ For what is the use of endless sorrow ?</l>
     <l n="21">Though the sun goes down , it will rise to-morrow ;</l>
     <l n="22">And life is not over yet .”</l>
     <l n="23">Oh ! I know this truth , if I know no other ,</l>
     <l n="24">That passionate Love is Pain ’ s own mother .</l>

   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ANGEL OR DEMON .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">You call me an angel of love and of light ,</l>
     <l n="2">A being of goodness and heavenly fire ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sent out from God ’ s kingdom to guide you aright ,</l>
     <l n="4">In paths where your spirits may mount and aspire .</l>
     <l n="5">You say that I glow like a star on its course ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like a ray from the altar , a spark from the source .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Now list to my answer ; let all the world hear it ,</l>
     <l n="8">I speak unafraid what I know to be true :</l>
     <l n="9">A pure , faithful love is the creative spirit</l>
     <l n="10">Which makes women angels ! I live but in you .</l>
     <l n="11">We are bound soul to soul by life ’ s holiest laws ;</l>
     <l n="12">If I am an angel — why you are the cause .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">As my ship skims the sea , I look up from the deck ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fair , firm at the wheel shines Love ’ s beautiful form ,</l>
     <l n="15">And shall I curse the barque that last night went to wreck ,</l>
     <l n="16">By the Pilot abandoned to darkness and storm ?</l>
     <l n="17">My craft is no stauncher , she too had been lost —</l>
     <l n="18">Had the wheelman deserted , or slept at his post .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">I laid down the wealth of my soul at your feet</l>
     <l n="20">( Some woman does this for some man every day ) .</l>
     <l n="21">No desperate creature who walks in the street ,</l>
     <l n="22">Has a wickeder heart than I might have , I say ,</l>
     <l n="23">Had you wantonly misused the treasures you won ,</l>
     <l n="24">— As so many men with heart riches have done .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">This fire from God ’ s altar , this holy love flame ,</l>
     <l n="26">That burns like sweet incense forever for you ,</l>
     <l n="27">Might now be a wild conflagration of shame ,</l>
     <l n="28">Had you tortured my heart , or been base or untrue .</l>
     <l n="29">For angels and devils are cast in one mold ,</l>
     <l n="30">Till love guides them upward , or downward , I hold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">I tell you the women who make fervent wives</l>
     <l n="32">And sweet tender mothers , had Fate been less fair ,</l>
     <l n="33">Are the women who might have abandoned their lives</l>
     <l n="34">To the madness that springs from and ends in despair .</l>
     <l n="35">As the fire on the hearth which sheds brightness around ,</l>
     <l n="36">Neglected , may level the walls to the ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">The world makes grave errors in judging these things ,</l>
     <l n="38">Great good and great evil are born in one breast .</l>
     <l n="39">Love horns us and hoofs us — or gives us our wings ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the best could be worst , as the worst could be best .</l>
     <l n="41">You must thank your own worth for what I grew to be ,</l>
     <l n="42">For the demon lurked under the angel in me .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>DAWN .</head>
     <l n="1">Day ’ s sweetest moments are at dawn ;</l>
     <l n="2">Refreshed by his long sleep , the Light</l>
     <l n="3">Kisses the languid lips of Night ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ere she can rise and hasten on .</l>
     <l n="5">All glowing from his dreamless rest</l>
     <l n="6">He holds her closely to his breast ,</l>
     <l n="7">Warm lip to lip and limb to limb ,</l>
     <l n="8">Until she dies for love of him .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PEACE AND LOVE .</head>
     <l n="1">There are two angels , messengers of light ,</l>
     <l n="2">Both born of God , who yet are bitterest foes .</l>
     <l n="3">No human breast their dual presence knows .</l>
     <l n="4">As violently opposed as wrong and right ,</l>
     <l n="5">When one draws near , the other takes swift flight</l>
     <l n="6">And when one enters , thence the other goes .</l>
     <l n="7">Till mortal life in the immortal flows ,</l>
     <l n="8">So must these two avoid each other ’ s sight .</l>
     <l n="9">Despair and hope may meet within one heart ,</l>
     <l n="10">The vulture may be comrade to the dove !</l>
     <l n="11">Pleasure and Pain swear friendship leal and true :</l>
     <l n="12">But till the grave unites them , still apart</l>
     <l n="13">Must dwell these angels known as Peace and Love .</l>
     <l n="14">For only Death can reconcile the two .</l>

     <l n="2">In all his solemn majesty and worth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Can we translate the meaning of life ’ s duty ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which God oft writes in cypher at our birth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Not till Love comes in all his strength and terror ,</l>
     <l n="6">Can we read other ’ s hearts ; not till then know</l>

     <l n="8">Or sound the quivering depths of mortal woe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Not till we sail with him o ’ er stormy oceans ,</l>
     <l n="10">Have we seen tempests ; hidden in his hand</l>

     <l n="13">Not till we walk with him on lofty mountains ,</l>

     <l n="15">When once we drink from his immortal fountains ,</l>
     <l n="16">We bid farewell to the light heart of youth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Thereafter our most perfect day will borrow</l>
     <l n="18">A dimming shadow from some dreaded night .</l>
     <l n="19">So great grows joy it merges into sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="20">And evermore pain tinctures our delight .</l>

    <head>BLASE .</head>

     <l n="1">The world has outlived all its passion ,</l>

     <l n="3">Its women mere puppets of fashion ;</l>
     <l n="4">Life now is a comedy play .</l>

     <l n="13">Vain Anthony boasts of his favors</l>
     <l n="14">From fair Cleopatra the frail ,</l>
     <l n="15">And the death of the sorceress savors</l>
     <l n="16">Less of asps than of ale .</l>

     <l n="17">With the march of bold civilization ,</l>

     <l n="3">A member of the Audubon Society was she ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">She spoke about the helpless birds we wickedly were harming ;</l>
     <l n="6">She quoted the statistics , and they really were alarming ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">She said God meant His little birds to sing in trees and skies ;</l>
     <l n="8">And there was pathos in her voice , and tears were in her eyes .</l>

     <l n="9">“ Oh , surely in this beauteous world you can find lovely things</l>

     <l n="11">I sat beside her that same day , in her own house at dinner ,</l>

     <l n="13">Her well-appointed table groaned beneath the ample spread</l>

     <l n="15">But still my charming hostess urged , “ Do have a reed-bird , dear ,</l>

     <l n="1">I saw on the hills of the morning ,</l>
     <l n="2">The form of the New Year arise ,</l>
     <l n="3">He stood like a statue adorning</l>
     <l n="4">The world with a background of skies .</l>
     <l n="5">There were courage and grace in his beautiful face ,</l>

     <l n="4">As the masts and the spars pass from view .</l>
     <l n="5">Weep not if some treasures go under ,</l>
     <l n="6">And sink in the rotten ship ’ s hold ,</l>
     <l n="7">That blithe bonny barque sailing yonder</l>
     <l n="8">May bring you more wealth than the old .</l>
