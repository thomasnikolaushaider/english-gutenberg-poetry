    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Oh that my words were now written ! Oh that they were inscribed in a book !— JOB xix , 23 .</p>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Books have , from time immemorial , been the conservators of human wisdom , the repositories of information , the mentors of youth and adolescence , the counsellors of manhood , the comfort and companionship of age .</p>
   <p>The experience of an individual , school or era , when committed to book form , becomes the common property of all succeeding time , and the accumulated knowledge of the past , transmitted from generation to generation , through the medium of books , may with justice be regarded as the most valuable of human heritages .</p>
   <p>But they have not always been unmixed blessings ; they have both led and misled ; they have elucidated , yet have mystified .</p>
   <p>They have dissipated the shadows of ignorance and superstition , but in some instances have confused and obscured the searchlight of truth . In the economy of human affairs , books have been factors of no small importance . They have proved the most potent expositors of iniquitous systems , and when properly directed against crying evils have accomplished speedy reforms . They have precipitated wars , incited revolts and seditions in the cause of progress , yet have intensified prejudice , political , religious and racial . With silent eloquence , they have cried out against the wrongs of those who had none to plead their cause , while in other cases , their influence has tended to perpetuate existing abuses . In some instances they have taught men to be content with servitude , in others have ignited the beacon fires of liberty . Though they are usually found enlisted under the banners of justice , yet no cause has ever been so unworthy , and no institution so unholy , that books have not been written in their defence . In verity , they have sown both wheat and tares .</p>
   <p>Books have been written on every conceivable subject , under all conditions , by all sorts of writers , and from an endless variety of motives . The recompense of those who have written them has been equally various . Some have been apotheosized and worshipped , others have been the recipients of orders and decorations of honor at the hands of kings and potentates , while others have received the ovations of admiring multitudes . Some have anonymously contributed their mite toward the enrichment of literature , others have appeared , from whence we know not , and after placing their offerings upon the altars of poesy and art have departed unrewarded into the shadows of obscurity , leaving as footprints innumerable quotations which have become proverbial . Some , as the bards and minnesingers of old who in mediaeval castles ate their bread by the sufferance of the feudal lords and barons , have in more recent years been dependent upon the bounty of some munificent , and usually titled patron , to whom they , as a matter of policy , dedicated their strains and panegyrics , consequently wielding mercenary pens . Some who have presumed to write in a manner displeasing to those who sat in high places have met with vilification , exile , imprisonment , decapitation , and have not been strangers to the pillory . Criticism and ridicule are the patent rewards of incipient authorship , while want , neglect and starvation have terminated the career of more than one name afterwards great in the world of letters .</p>
   <p>Aside from motives common to all who with reverent steps humbly strive to follow where the great lights of poesy have led , the author of these unpretentious pages has been actuated by a desire to portray , in his correct light , a very frequently misrepresented character , viz . : the pioneer prospector . It has long been customary for writers of western fiction to picture this character as a large-hearted but rough and untutored individual , expressing himself in a vernacular consisting of equal parts of slang , profanity and questionable grammar , possessing no ambitions above the card table or the strong waters which cause all men to err who drink them . An intimate acquaintance with this class , extending from the years of infancy to middle age , convinces the writer that the common description is manifestly unjust and misleading .</p>
   <p>The men who flocked to the early gold excitements , and who subsequently prospected the western mountain ranges for their hidden wealth , were the cream of American and European manhood ; men possessed of more than ordinary endowments of intellect , education and physique , while their industry , bravery and hardihood have never been questioned .</p>
   <p>Proof of this exists in the names which have lingered behind them as a matter of record , for it was the prospector who christened the mountains , gulches and mining locations of the west . A cursory perusal of the maps of mineral surveys in any western mining district , will reveal in abundance such names as Hector , Ajax , Golden Fleece , Atlas , Pegasus , etc . ; indicating that those who applied them were , if not college graduates , men not unfamiliar with the classics . The use of such names as Cleopatra , Crusader or Magna Charta , by a prospector unversed in history , would naturally be unexpected . One without knowledge of literature would hardly grace his location stakes with such names as Dante , Hamlet or Mephistopheles , while one entirely unlettered could not by chance hit upon such names as Pandora , Medusa or Sesostris .</p>
   <p>Of the pioneer prospectors but few remain ; many have fallen asleep , others tiring of the privation and uncertainty incident to a miner 's life , are pursuing other vocations , while many have become prosperous ranch and cattle-men and may now be found in almost any western valley . A few , a very few in comparison with the less fortunate majority , acquiring a competence , removed to other localities , and in not a few instances , have become conspicuous figures in the world of business , politics and finance .</p>
   <p>In the mountainous districts of the west , you may still occasionally see a veteran prospector of the old school , living the life of a hermit in his log cabin , situated in some picturesque park or gulch , near his , sometimes valuable but more frequently worthless , mining locations . There he lives winter and summer , his only companion a cat or dog ; the ambitions of his youth still unrealized , but at three score and ten , hopeful and expectant . His bent form , white hair , and venerable bearing impress you strangely at first , but it is only when you overcome the reticence peculiar to those who have long dwelt in solitude , and engage him in conversation , that his mental status becomes apparent . To your surprise you discover that he can converse entertainingly on any subject , from the Mosaic dispensation , to the latest inventions in the world of mechanism . You may find him to be , not only a Shakspearean scholar , but a deep student of that volume which , whether considered from a sacred or secular point of view , stands preeminently forth as the Book of Books . You may find him able to translate Homer , or Virgil , and that the masterpieces of literature are as familiar to him as his own cabin walls . A glimpse at the interior of his cabin discloses an ample stock of newspapers and magazines , while books are not strangers . There is something pathetic about his loneliness ; you leave him with the feeling that society has been the loser by his voluntary banishment , and are reminded of Gray 's immortal lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Full many a gem of purest ray serene .</l>
     <l n="2">The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear ;</l>
     <l n="3">Full many a flower is born to blush unseen ,</l>
     <l n="4">And waste its sweetness on the desert air . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You speculate upon the story of his life , for you feel that it has a secret , if not a tragedy , connected with it , into which you may not probe . You ask yourself the question , “ Has not his life been wasted ? ” and if he alone is to be considered , there is none but an affirmative answer . But his life has not been barren of results . He has been a contributory factor in the upbuilding of an empire , for he is one of the class who laid the foundations of western prosperity .</p>
   <p>These men came west for various reasons , some actuated by the spirit of adventure , some to acquire fortunes or to retrieve vanished ones , others possibly to outlive the stigma of youthful mistakes . In the lives of many of them are sealed chapters . It is with such that these pages have to do .</p>

   <p>‘ Tis human nature to review again The stirring incidents of joy or pain ; So on the eve of the succeeding day , When four-and-twenty hours had passed away , The party grouped around the blazing light Which from the fireplace streamed into the night , And in its glow , so comfortable and warm , Recounted the disasters of the storm . Like some informal gathering , at first All spoke at once , as with a common burst ; Then as the intermittent tempest wailed , The talk subsided and a calm prevailed . All watched the pitch ooze from the knots and burn , Or smoked their pipes in silent unconcern .</p>
   <p>Some moments passed , when Uncle Jim arose , Nudged Dad McGuire , who seemed inclined to doze , And as he started up and rubbed his eyes Addressed him and the Russian in this wise : “ Two days ago the three of us confessed The reasons , that impelled us to come West ; Now if it please your brethren to relate The strange caprice of fortune or of fate , Which led them hither ,— after all these years , The boys will listen with attentive ears . ”</p>

     <l n="89">Grim Dissolution knows no favorites ,</l>
     <l n="90">But in his multiplicity of shapes</l>
     <l n="91">Invades alike , with stern resistless step ,</l>
     <l n="92">The squalid hovel with its noisome air ,</l>
     <l n="93">And palace most replete with opulence ;</l>
     <l n="94">Those of exalted station , and the hordes</l>
     <l n="95">To whom existence means but servitude ,</l>
     <l n="96">Who see the golden sun arise and bring</l>
     <l n="97">No intermission from their ceaseless toil ,</l>
     <l n="98">Who hope for respite only with the night ;</l>
     <l n="99">Those who in dread reluctance shrank from death ,</l>
     <l n="100">And those who neither knew nor cared the hour ,</l>
     <l n="101">To life and death alike indifferent ,</l>
     <l n="102">Or fain themselves would snap the fragile thread ;</l>
     <l n="103">Mankind in all conditions and degrees</l>
     <l n="104">Of culture , affluence and penury ,</l>
     <l n="105">Of multiform endowments and desires ,</l>
     <l n="106">With differing talents and proclivities ,</l>
     <l n="107">Yea , all varieties and types of men ,</l>
     <l n="108">With pathways various and diversified ,</l>
     <l n="109">Have found their paths converging at the grave .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">

     <l n="111">In solemn chaos of unfathomed gloom ,</l>
     <l n="112">Descend in sombre , melancholy pall ,</l>
     <l n="113">And mark apace life 's transitory eve ,</l>
     <l n="114">Must quaff , alike , the bitter draught of death ,</l>
     <l n="115">The one libation in which all who breathe</l>
     <l n="116">May in all equity participate .</l>
     <l n="117">Each , at the expiration of his span ,</l>
     <l n="118">Has found the same relentless terminal ,</l>

     <l n="120">With what of strength , or guilt or innocence</l>
     <l n="121">Did mark the tenor of his brief career ,</l>
     <l n="122">Has passed up to the margin of the grave ,</l>

     <l n="124">What is Death ?</l>
     <l n="125">We know not , yet in verity we feel</l>
     <l n="126">That , though of most immediate concern ,</l>
     <l n="127">And shrouded deep in sable mystery ,</l>
     <l n="128">Though most abstruse , intangible and strange ,</l>
     <l n="129">‘ Tis not of our volition and control !</l>
     <l n="130">It therefore proves , as life doth ever prove ,</l>
     <l n="131">With all abundant plenitude of proof ,</l>
     <l n="132">A Force superior to human strength ,</l>
     <l n="133">And should afford no premises for fear .</l>
