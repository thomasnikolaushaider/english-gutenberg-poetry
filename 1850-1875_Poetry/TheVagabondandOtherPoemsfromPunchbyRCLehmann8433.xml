     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">It was deadly cold in Danbury town</l>
       <l n="3">One terrible night in mid November ,</l>
       <l n="4">A night that the Danbury folk remember</l>
       <l n="5">For the sleety wind that hammered them down ,</l>
       <l n="6">That chilled their faces and chapped their skin ,</l>
       <l n="7">And froze their fingers and bit their feet ,</l>
       <l n="8">And made them ice to the heart within ,</l>
       <l n="9">And spattered and scattered</l>
       <l n="10">And shattered and battered</l>
       <l n="11">Their shivering bodies about the street ;</l>
       <l n="12">And the fact is most of them did n't roam</l>
       <l n="13">In the face of the storm , but stayed at home ;</l>
       <l n="14">While here and there a policeman , stamping</l>
       <l n="15">To keep himself warm or sedately tramping</l>
       <l n="16">Hither and thither , paced his beat ;</l>
       <l n="17">Or peered where out of the blizzard 's welter</l>
       <l n="18">Some wretched being had crept to shelter ,</l>
       <l n="19">And now , drenched through by the sleet , a muddled</l>
       <l n="20">Blur of a man and his rags , lay huddled .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="21">But one there was who did n't care ,</l>
       <l n="22">Whatever the furious storm might dare ,</l>
       <l n="23">A wonderful , hook-nosed bright-eyed fellow</l>
       <l n="24">In a thin brown cape and a cap of yellow</l>
       <l n="25">That perched on his dripping coal-black hair .</l>
       <l n="26">A red scarf set off his throat and bound him ,</l>
       <l n="27">Crossing his breast , and , winding round him ,</l>
       <l n="28">Flapped at his flank</l>
       <l n="29">In a red streak dank ;</l>
       <l n="30">And his hose were red , with a purple sheen</l>
       <l n="31">From his tunic 's blue , and his shoes were green .</l>
       <l n="32">He was most outlandishly patched together</l>
       <l n="33">With ribbons of silk and tags of leather ,</l>
       <l n="34">And chains of silver and buttons of stone ,</l>
       <l n="35">And knobs of amber and polished bone ,</l>
       <l n="36">And a turquoise brooch and a collar of jade ,</l>
       <l n="37">And a belt and a pouch of rich brocade ,</l>
       <l n="38">And a gleaming dagger with inlaid blade</l>
       <l n="39">And jewelled handle of burnished gold</l>
       <l n="40">Rakishly stuck in the red scarf 's fold —</l>
       <l n="41">A dress , in short , that might suit a wizard</l>
       <l n="42">On a calm warm day</l>
       <l n="43">In the month of May ,</l>
       <l n="44">But was hardly fit for an autumn blizzard .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="45">Whence had he come there ? Who could say ,</l>
       <l n="46">As he swung through Danbury town that day ,</l>
       <l n="47">With a friendly light in his deep-set eyes ,</l>
       <l n="48">And his free wild gait and his upright bearing ,</l>
       <l n="49">And his air that nothing could well surprise ,</l>
       <l n="50">So bright it was and so bold and daring ?</l>
       <l n="51">He might have troubled the slothful ease</l>
       <l n="52">Of the Great Mogul in a warlike fever ;</l>
       <l n="53">He might have bled for the Maccabees ,</l>
       <l n="54">Or risen , spurred</l>
       <l n="55">By the Prophet 's word ,</l>
       <l n="56">And swooped on the hosts of the unbeliever .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="57">Whatever his birth and his nomenclature ,</l>
       <l n="58">Something he seemed to have , some knowledge</l>
       <l n="59">That never was taught at school or college ,</l>
       <l n="60">But was part of his very being 's nature :</l>
       <l n="61">Some ingrained lore that wanderers show</l>
       <l n="62">As over the earth they come and go ,</l>
       <l n="63">Though they hardly know what it is they know .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="64">And so with his head upheld he walked ,</l>
       <l n="65">And ever the rain drove down ;</l>
       <l n="66">And now and again to himself he talked</l>
       <l n="67">In the streets of Danbury town .</l>
       <l n="68">And now and again he 'd stop and troll</l>
       <l n="69">A stave of music that seemed to roll</l>
       <l n="70">From the inmost depths of his ardent soul ;</l>
       <l n="71">But the wind took hold of the notes and tossed them</l>
       <l n="72">And the few who chanced to be near him lost them .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="73">So , moving on where his fancy listed ,</l>
       <l n="74">He came to a street that turned and twisted ;</l>
       <l n="75">And there by a shop-front dimly lighted</l>
       <l n="76">He suddenly stopped as though affrighted ,</l>
       <l n="77">Stopped and stared with his deep gaze centred</l>
       <l n="78">On something seen , like a dream 's illusion ,</l>
       <l n="79">Through the streaming glass , mid the queer confusion</l>
       <l n="80">Of objects littered on shelf and floor ,</l>
       <l n="81">And about the counter and by the door —</l>
       <l n="82">And then with his lips set tight he entered .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="83">There were rusty daggers and battered breastplates ,</l>
       <l n="84">And jugs of pewter and carved oak cases ,</l>
       <l n="85">And china monsters with hideous faces ,</l>
       <l n="86">And cracked old plates that had once been best plates ;</l>
       <l n="87">And needle-covers and such old-wivery ;</l>
       <l n="88">Wonderful chess-men made from ivory ;</l>
       <l n="89">Cut-glass bottles for wines and brandies ,</l>
       <l n="90">Sticks once flourished by bucks and dandies ;</l>
       <l n="91">Deep old glasses they drank enough in ,</l>
       <l n="92">And golden boxes they took their snuff in ;</l>
       <l n="93">Rings that flashed on a gallant 's knuckles ,</l>
       <l n="94">Seals and lockets and shining buckles ;</l>
       <l n="95">Watches sadly in need of menders ,</l>
       <l n="96">Blackened firedogs and dinted fenders ;</l>
       <l n="97">Prints and pictures and quaint knick-knackery ,</l>
       <l n="98">Rare old silver and mere gimcrackery —</l>
       <l n="99">Such was the shop , and in its middle</l>
       <l n="100">Stood an old man holding a dusty fiddle .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="101">The Vagabond bowed and the old man bowed ,</l>
       <l n="102">And then the Vagabond spoke aloud .</l>
       <l n="103">“ Sir , ” he said , “ we are two of a trade ,</l>
       <l n="104">Each for the other planned and made ,</l>
       <l n="105">And so we shall come to a fair agreement ,</l>
       <l n="106">Since I am for you and you 're for me meant .</l>
       <l n="107">And I , having travelled hither from far , gain</l>
       <l n="108">You yourself as my life 's best bargain .</l>
       <l n="109">But I am one</l>
       <l n="110">Who chaffers for fun ,</l>
       <l n="111">Who when he perceives such stores of beauty</l>
       <l n="112">Outspread conceives it to be his duty</l>
       <l n="113">To buy of his visit a slight memento :</l>
       <l n="114">Some curious gem of the quattrocento ,</l>
       <l n="115">Or something equally rare and priceless ,</l>
       <l n="116">Though its outward fashions perhaps entice less :</l>
       <l n="117">A Sultan 's slipper , a Bishop 's mitre ,</l>
       <l n="118">Or the helmet owned by a Roundhead fighter ,</l>
       <l n="119">Or an old buff coat by the years worn thin ,</l>
       <l n="120">Or — what do you say to the violin ?</l>
       <l n="121">I 'll wager you 've many , so you can n't miss one ,</l>
       <l n="122">And I — well , I have a mind for this one ,</l>
       <l n="123">This which was made , as you must know ,</l>
       <l n="124">Three hundred years and a year ago</l>
       <l n="125">By one who dwelt in Cremona city</l>
       <l n="126">For me — but I lost it , more 's the pity ,</l>
       <l n="127">Sixty years back in a wild disorder</l>
       <l n="128">That flamed to a fight on the Afghan border ;</l>
       <l n="129">And , whatever it costs , I am bound to win it ,</l>
       <l n="130">For I left the half of my full soul in it . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="131">And now as he spoke his eyes began</l>
       <l n="132">To shiver the heart of the grey old man ;</l>
       <l n="133">And the old man stuttered ,</l>
       <l n="134">And “ Sir , ” he muttered ,</l>
       <l n="135">“ The words you speak are the merest riddle ,</l>
       <l n="136">But-five pounds down , and you own the fiddle !</l>
       <l n="137">And I 'll choose for your hand , while the pounds you dole out ,</l>
       <l n="138">A bow with which you may pick that soul out . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="139">So said so done , and our friend again</l>
       <l n="140">Was out in the raging wind and rain .</l>
       <l n="141">Swift through the twisting street he passed</l>
       <l n="142">And came to the Market Square at last ,</l>
       <l n="143">And climbed and stood</l>
       <l n="144">On a block of wood</l>
       <l n="145">Where a pent-house , leant to a wall , gave shelter</l>
       <l n="146">From the brunt of the blizzard 's helter-skelter ,</l>
       <l n="147">And , waving his bow , he cried , “ Ahoy !</l>
       <l n="148">Now steady your hearts for an hour of joy ! ”</l>
       <l n="149">And so to his cheek and jutting chin</l>
       <l n="150">Straight he fitted the violin ,</l>
       <l n="151">And , rounding his arm in a movement gay ,</l>
       <l n="152">Touched the strings and began to play .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="153">There has n't been heard since the world spun round</l>
       <l n="154">Such a marvellous blend of thrilling sound .</l>
       <l n="155">It streamed , it flamed , it rippled and blazed ,</l>
       <l n="156">And now it reproached and now it praised ,</l>
       <l n="157">And the liquid notes of it wove a scheme</l>
       <l n="158">That was one-half life and one-half a dream .</l>
       <l n="159">And again it scaled in a rush of fire</l>
       <l n="160">The glittering peaks of high desire ;</l>
       <l n="161">Now , foiled and shattered , it rose again</l>
       <l n="162">And plucked at the souls and hearts of men ;</l>
       <l n="163">And still as it rose the sleet came down</l>
       <l n="164">In the Market Square of Danbury town .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="165">And now from hundreds of opened doors ,</l>
       <l n="166">With quiet paces</l>
       <l n="167">And happy faces ,</l>
       <l n="168">In ones and twos and threes and fours ,</l>
       <l n="169">A crowd pressed out to the Market Square</l>
       <l n="170">And stood in the storm and listened there .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="171">And , oh , with what a solemn tender strain</l>
       <l n="172">The long-drawn music eased their hearts of pain ;</l>
       <l n="173">And gave them visions of divine content ;</l>
       <l n="174">Green fields and happy valleys far away ,</l>
       <l n="175">And rippling streams and sunshine and the scent</l>
       <l n="176">Of bursting buds and flowers that come in May .</l>
       <l n="177">And one spoke in a rapt and gentle voice ,</l>
       <l n="178">And bade his friends rejoice ,</l>
       <l n="179">“ For now , ” he said , “ I see , I see once more</l>
       <l n="180">My little lass upon a pleasant shore</l>
       <l n="181">Standing , as long ago she used to stand ,</l>
       <l n="182">And beckoning to me with her dimpled hand .</l>
       <l n="183">As in the vanished years ,</l>
       <l n="184">So I behold her and forget my tears . ”</l>
       <l n="185">And each one had his private joy , his own ,</l>
       <l n="186">All the old happy things he once had known ,</l>
       <l n="187">Renewed and from the prisoning past set free ,</l>
       <l n="188">And mixed with hope and happy things to be .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="189">So for a magic hour the music gushed ,</l>
       <l n="190">Then faded to a close , and all was hushed ,</l>
       <l n="191">And the tranced people woke and looked about ,</l>
       <l n="192">And fell to wondering what had brought them out</l>
       <l n="193">On such a night of wind and piercing sleet ,</l>
       <l n="194">Exposed with hatless heads and thin-shod feet .</l>
       <l n="195">Something , they knew , had chased their heavy sadness ;</l>
       <l n="196">And for the years to come they still may keep ,</l>
       <l n="197">As from a morning sleep ,</l>
       <l n="198">Some broken gleam of half-remembered gladness .</l>
       <l n="199">But the wild fiddler on his feet of flame</l>
       <l n="200">Vanished and went the secret way he came .</l>

      <head>SINGING WATER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I heard — ‘ twas on a morning , but when it was and where ,</l>
       <l n="2">Except that well I heard it , I neither know nor care —</l>
       <l n="3">I heard , and , oh , the sunlight was shining in the blue ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">

       <l n="8">There 's music in the wavelets she tosses to the Thames .</l>

       <l n="9">The eddies have an air too , and brave it is and blithe ;</l>
       <l n="10">I think I may have heard it that day at Bablockhythe ;</l>
       <l n="11">And where the Eynsham weir-fall breaks out in rainbow spray</l>
       <l n="12">The Evenlode comes singing to join the pretty play .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">But where I heard that music I cannot rightly tell ;</l>
       <l n="14">I only know I heard it , and that I know full well :</l>
       <l n="15">I heard a little water , and , oh , the sky was blue ,</l>
       <l n="16">A little water singing as little waters do .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Like winds that with the setting of the sun</l>
       <l n="4">Draw to a quiet murmuring and cease ,</l>
       <l n="5">So is her little struggle fought and done ;</l>
       <l n="6">And the brief fever and the pain</l>
       <l n="7">In a last sigh fade out and so release</l>
       <l n="8">The lately-breathing dust they may not hurt again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">Now all that Wilma was is made as naught :</l>
       <l n="10">Stilled is the laughter that was erst our pleasure ;</l>
       <l n="11">The pretty air , the childish grace untaught ,</l>
       <l n="12">The innocent wiles ,</l>
       <l n="13">And all the sunny smiles ,</l>
       <l n="14">The cheek that flushed to greet some tiny treasure ;</l>
       <l n="15">The mouth demure , the tilted chin held high ,</l>
       <l n="16">The gleeful flashes of her glancing eye ;</l>
       <l n="17">Her shy bold look of wildness unconfined ,</l>
       <l n="18">And the gay impulse of her baby mind</l>
       <l n="19">That none could tame ,</l>
       <l n="20">That sent her spinning round ,</l>
       <l n="21">A spirit of living flame</l>
       <l n="22">Dancing in airy rapture o'er the ground —</l>
       <l n="23">All these with that faint sigh are made to be</l>
       <l n="24">Man 's breath upon a glass , a mortal memory .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">Then from the silent room where late she played ,</l>
       <l n="26">Setting a steady course toward the light ,</l>
       <l n="27">Swifter than thistledown the little shade ,</l>
       <l n="28">Reft from the nooks that she had made her own</l>
       <l n="29">And from the love that sheltered , fared alone</l>
       <l n="30">Forth through the gloomy spaces of the night ,</l>
       <l n="31">Until at last she lit before the gate</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">Grim Cerberus , the foiler of the dead ,</l>

       <l n="35">In deep-mouthed wrath</l>
       <l n="36">Athwart the rocky path ,</l>
       <l n="37">Did at her coming raise his triple head</l>

       <l n="39">But when he saw our tender little maid</l>
       <l n="40">Forlorn , but unafraid ,</l>
       <l n="41">He blinked his flaming eyes and ceased to frown ,</l>
       <l n="42">And , fawning on her , smoothed his shaggy crest ,</l>
       <l n="43">Composed his savage limbs and settled down</l>
       <l n="44">With ears laid back and all his care at rest ;</l>
       <l n="45">And so with kindly aspect beckoned in</l>
       <l n="46">The little playmate of his earthly kin .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="47">For often she had tugged old Rollo 's mane ,</l>

       <l n="50">Lufra and Rollo , who with anxious faces</l>
       <l n="51">Now cast about the haunts and hiding-places</l>

       <l n="53">So now , set free from all that can oppress ,</l>

       <l n="61">The amaranthine the delightful ways ,</l>
       <l n="62">Gushes the pretty notes and careless trills</l>
       <l n="63">Of her unstudied song ,</l>

       <l n="69">Ye will not chide if sometimes in her play</l>
       <l n="70">The child should start and droop her shining head ,</l>
       <l n="71">Turning in meek surmise</l>
       <l n="72">Her wistful eyes</l>
       <l n="73">Back tow'rd the dimness of our mortal day</l>
       <l n="74">And the loved home from which her soul was sped .</l>
       <l n="75">Soon shall our little Wilma learn to be</l>
       <l n="76">Amid the immortal blest</l>
       <l n="77">An unrepining guest ,</l>

        <l n="1">There 's nothing I know of to make you spend</l>
        <l n="2">A day of your life at Cragwell End .</l>
        <l n="3">It 's a village quiet and grey and old ,</l>
        <l n="4">A little village tucked into a fold</l>
        <l n="5">( A sort of valley , not over wide )</l>
        <l n="6">Of the hills that flank it on either side .</l>
        <l n="7">There 's a large grey church with a square stone tower ,</l>

        <l n="9">In a chime that shivers the village calm</l>
        <l n="10">With a few odd bits of the 100th psalm .</l>
        <l n="11">A red-brick Vicarage stands thereby ,</l>
        <l n="12">Breathing comfort and lapped in ease ,</l>
        <l n="13">With a row of elms thick-trunked and high ,</l>

        <l n="16">( No tie could be neater or whiter than his tie )</l>
        <l n="17">Maintains the struggle against dissent ,</l>
        <l n="18">An Oxford scholar ex Aede Christi ;</l>
        <l n="19">And there in his twenty-minute sermons</l>
        <l n="20">He makes mince-meat of the modern Germans ,</l>
        <l n="21">Defying their apparatus criticus</l>
        <l n="22">Like a brave old Vicar ,</l>
        <l n="23">A famous sticker</l>
        <l n="24">To Genesis , Exodus and Leviticus .</l>
        <l n="25">He enjoys himself like a hearty boy</l>
        <l n="26">Who finds his life for his needs the aptest ;</l>

        <l n="28">Is the Revd . Joshua Fall , the Baptist ,</l>
        <l n="29">An earnest man with a tongue that stings —</l>
        <l n="30">The Vicar calls him a child of schism —</l>
        <l n="31">Who has dared to utter some dreadful things</l>
        <l n="32">On the vices of sacerdotalism ,</l>
        <l n="33">And the ruination</l>
        <l n="34">Of education</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="36">Set in a circle of oak and beech ,</l>
        <l n="37">North of the village lies Cragwell Hall ;</l>
        <l n="38">And stretching far as the eye can reach ,</l>
        <l n="39">Over the slopes and beyond the fall</l>
        <l n="40">Of the hills so keeping their guard about it</l>
        <l n="41">That the north wind never may chill or flout it ,</l>
        <l n="42">Through forests as dense as that of Arden ,</l>
        <l n="43">With orchard and park and trim-kept garden ,</l>
        <l n="44">And farms for pasture and farms for tillage ,</l>

        <l n="46">And in the Hall</l>
        <l n="47">Lived the lord of all ,</l>
        <l n="48">Girt round with all that our hearts desire</l>
        <l n="49">Of leisure and wealth , the ancient Squire .</l>
        <l n="50">He was the purplest-faced old man</l>
        <l n="51">Since ever the Darville race began ,</l>
        <l n="52">Pompous and purple-faced and proud ;</l>
        <l n="53">With a portly girth and a voice so loud</l>
        <l n="54">You might have heard it a mile away</l>
        <l n="55">When he cheered the hounds on a hunting day .</l>
        <l n="56">He was hard on dissenters and such encroachers ,</l>
        <l n="57">He was hard on sinners and hard on poachers ;</l>
        <l n="58">He talked of his rights as one who knew</l>
        <l n="59">That the pick of the earth to him was due :</l>
        <l n="60">The right to this and the right to that ,</l>
        <l n="61">To the humble look and the lifted hat ;</l>
        <l n="62">The right to scold or evict a peasant ,</l>
        <l n="63">The right to partridge and hare and pheasant ;</l>
        <l n="64">The right to encourage discontent</l>
        <l n="65">By raising a hard-worked farmer 's rent ;</l>
        <l n="66">The manifest right to ride to hounds</l>
        <l n="67">Through his own or anyone else 's grounds ;</l>
        <l n="68">The right to eat of the best by day</l>
        <l n="69">And to snore the whole of the night away ;</l>
        <l n="70">For his motto , as often he explained ,</l>
        <l n="71">Was “ A Darville holds what a Darville gained . ”</l>
        <l n="72">He tried to be just , but that may be</l>
        <l n="73">Small merit in one who has most things free ;</l>
        <l n="74">And his neighbours averred ,</l>
        <l n="75">When they heard the word ,</l>
        <l n="76">“ Old Darville 's a just man , is he ? Bust his</l>

        <l n="78">The village itself runs , more or less ,</l>

        <l n="93">To admit that his business in life is killing ,</l>
        <l n="94">Who parades a heart as soft as his meat 's tough —</l>

        <l n="116">On the central point of the pleasant Green</l>

        <l n="120">No matter how long the rain might fail</l>
        <l n="121">There was always enough for can and pail —</l>

        <l n="123">To the dried-out rivals of Cragwell End .</l>
        <l n="124">An army might have been sent to raise</l>

        <l n="127">One vast soap-sudded and wash-tubbed Monday ,</l>

        <l n="132">Thirsty , spent with his toil and faint ,</l>
        <l n="133">To the site of the well once made his way ,</l>
        <l n="134">And there he saw a delightful rill</l>
        <l n="135">And sat beside it and drank his fill ,</l>
        <l n="136">Drank of the rill and found it good ,</l>
        <l n="137">Sitting at ease on a block of wood ,</l>

        <l n="139">The waters have ceased but they run for ever .</l>
        <l n="140">They burnt St. Crag , so the stories say ,</l>
        <l n="141">And his ashes cast on the winds away ,</l>
        <l n="142">But the well survives , and the block of wood</l>
        <l n="143">Stands — nay , stood where it always stood ,</l>
        <l n="144">And still was the village 's pride and glory</l>

        <l n="146">Gnarled and knotty and weather-stained ,</l>

       <l n="2">Who deftly ply your pails and spades ,</l>
       <l n="3">All you who sturdily take your stand</l>
       <l n="4">On your pebble-buttressed forts of sand ,</l>
       <l n="5">And thence defy</l>
       <l n="6">With a fearless eye</l>
       <l n="7">And a burst of rollicking high-pitched laughter</l>
       <l n="8">The stealthy trickling waves that lap you</l>
       <l n="9">And the crested breakers that tumble after</l>
       <l n="10">To souse and batter you , sting and sap you —</l>
       <l n="11">All you roll-about rackety little folk ,</l>

       <l n="16">For , lo , he comes , your tricksy little friend ,</l>
       <l n="17">From the clear caverns of his crystal home</l>
       <l n="18">Beyond the tossing ridges of the foam :</l>
       <l n="19">Planner of sandy romps and wet delights ,</l>
       <l n="20">Robin the Sea-boy , prince of ocean-sprites ,</l>
       <l n="21">Is come , is come to lead you in your play</l>
       <l n="22">And fill your hearts with mirth and jocund sport to-day !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="23">What ! Ca n't you see him ? There he stands</l>
       <l n="24">On a sheer rock and lifts his hands ,</l>
       <l n="25">A little lad not three feet high ,</l>
       <l n="26">With dancing mischief in his eye .</l>
       <l n="27">His body gleams against the light ,</l>
       <l n="28">A clear-cut shape of dazzling white</l>
       <l n="29">Set off and topped by golden hair</l>
       <l n="30">That streams and tosses in the air .</l>
       <l n="31">A moment poised , he dares the leap</l>
       <l n="32">And cuts the wind and cleaves the deep .</l>
       <l n="33">Down through the emerald vaults self-hurled</l>
       <l n="34">That roof the sea-god 's awful world .</l>
       <l n="35">Another moment sees him rise</l>
       <l n="36">And beat the salt spray from his eyes .</l>
       <l n="37">He breasts the waves , he spurns their blows ;</l>
       <l n="38">Then , like a rocket , up he goes ,</l>
       <l n="39">Up , up to where the gusty wind</l>
       <l n="40">With all its wrath is left behind ;</l>
       <l n="41">Still up he soars and high and high</l>
       <l n="42">A speck of light that dots the sky .</l>
       <l n="43">Then watch him as he slowly droops</l>
       <l n="44">Where the great sea-birds wheel their troops .</l>
       <l n="45">Three broad-winged gulls , himself their lord ,</l>
       <l n="46">He hitches to a silken cord ,</l>
       <l n="47">Bits them and bridles them with skill</l>
       <l n="48">And bids them draw him where he will .</l>
       <l n="49">Above the tumult of the shores</l>
       <l n="50">He floats , he stoops , he darts , he soars ;</l>
       <l n="51">From near and far he calls the rest</l>
       <l n="52">And waves them forward for a quest ;</l>
       <l n="53">Then straight , without a check , he speeds</l>
       <l n="54">Across the azure tracts and leads</l>
       <l n="55">With apt reproof and cheering words</l>
       <l n="56">As on a chase his cry of birds .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="57">And when he has finished his airy fun</l>
       <l n="58">And all his flights and his swoops are done</l>
       <l n="59">He will drop to the shore and lend a hand</l>
       <l n="60">In building a castle of weed and sand .</l>
       <l n="61">He will cover with flints its frowning face</l>
       <l n="62">To keep the tide in its proper place ,</l>
       <l n="63">And the waves shall employ their utmost damp art</l>
       <l n="64">In vain to abolish your moated rampart .</l>
       <l n="65">And nobody 's nurse shall make a fuss ,</l>
       <l n="66">As is far too often the case with us ;</l>
       <l n="67">Instead of the usual how-de-do</l>
       <l n="68">She will give us praise when we get wet through ;</l>
       <l n="69">In fact she will smile and think it better</l>
       <l n="70">When we get as wet as we like and wetter .</l>
       <l n="71">As for eating too much , you can safely risk it</l>
       <l n="72">With chocolate , lollipop , cake , and biscuit ,</l>
       <l n="73">And your mother will revel with high delight</l>
       <l n="74">In the state of her own one 's appetite .</l>
       <l n="75">Great shells there shall be of a rainbow hue</l>
       <l n="76">To be found and gathered by me and you ;</l>
       <l n="77">Wonderful nets for the joy of making ‘ em .</l>
       <l n="78">And scores of shrimps for the trouble of taking ‘ em ;</l>
       <l n="79">In fact it is n't half bad — now is it ?—</l>
       <l n="80">When Robin the Sea-boy pays his visit .</l>
       <l n="81">And perhaps he will tire of his shape and habit</l>
       <l n="82">And change and turn to a frisky rabbit ,</l>
       <l n="83">A plump young gadabout cheerful fellow</l>
       <l n="84">With a twitching nose and a coat of yellow ,</l>
       <l n="85">And never the smallest trace of fear</l>
       <l n="86">From his flashing scut to his flattened ear .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="87">But , lo , there 's a hint of coming rain ,</l>
       <l n="88">So , presto , Robin is back again .</l>
       <l n="89">He lifts his head and he cocks his eye</l>
       <l n="90">And waves his hand and prepares to fly —</l>
       <l n="91">“ Good-bye , Robin , good-bye , good-bye ! ”</l>

       <l n="5">With a preening of wings</l>
       <l n="6">They are forming in rings ;</l>

        <l n="55">On an inaccessible rocky shelf ,</l>
        <l n="56">Where at last it managed to hatch itself .</l>
        <l n="57">Whatever the cause , the result is plain :</l>
        <l n="58">We 're in for a dragon-fuss again .</l>
        <l n="59">We have n't the time , and , what is worse ,</l>
        <l n="60">We have n't the means to frame a curse .</l>
        <l n="61">So what is there left for us to say</l>
        <l n="62">Save this , that our men at break of day</l>

       <l n="61">They are Indian braves , a terrible band ,</l>

       <l n="64">Fiercely stuck in his gleaming teeth .</l>
       <l n="65">Are the dragons awake ? Are the dragons sleepers ?</l>
       <l n="66">Will they meet and scatter these crafty creepers ?</l>
       <l n="67">What ho ! ... But John , who has sorely tried me ,</l>
       <l n="68">Trots up and flattens his nose beside me ;</l>
       <l n="69">Against the window he flattens it</l>

       <l n="71">As well as me ,</l>

       <l n="7">Oh get hold of it and shove it !</l>
       <l n="8">It is labour , but you love it ;</l>
       <l n="9">Let your stroke be long and mighty ; keep your body on the swing ;</l>
       <l n="10">While your pulses dance a measure</l>
       <l n="11">Full of pride and full of pleasure .</l>
       <l n="12">And the boat flies free and joyous like a swallow on the wing .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Isis blessed her noble youngsters as they left her ; Father Camus</l>
       <l n="14">Sped his youths to fame and Putney from his grey and ancient Courts :—</l>
       <l n="15">“ Keep , ” they said , “ the old traditions , and we know you will not shame us</l>
       <l n="16">When you try the stormy tideway in your zephyrs and your shorts .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">“ For it 's toil and tribulation till your roughnesses are polished ,</l>
       <l n="18">And it 's bitterness and sorrow till the work of oars is done ;</l>
       <l n="19">But it 's high delight and triumph when your faults are all abolished ,</l>
       <l n="20">With yourself and seven brothers firmly welded into one . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">So they stood the weary trial and the people poured to greet them ,</l>
       <l n="22">Filled a cup with praise and welcome — it was theirs to take and quaff ;</l>
       <l n="23">And they ranged their ships alongside , and the umpire came to meet them ,</l>
       <l n="24">And they stripped themselves and waited till his pistol sent them off .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">With a dash and spurt and rally ; with a swing and drive and rattle ,</l>
       <l n="26">Both the boats went flashing faster as they cleft the swelling stream ;</l>
       <l n="27">And the old familiar places , scenes of many a sacred battle ,</l>
       <l n="28">Just were seen for half a moment and went by them in a dream .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">But at last the flag has fallen and the splendid fight is finished ,</l>
       <l n="30">And the victory is blazoned on the record-roll of Fame .</l>
       <l n="31">They are spent and worn and broken , but their soul is undiminished ;</l>
       <l n="32">There are winners now and losers , but their glory is the same !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Chorus .</l>
       <l n="34">Oh get hold of it and shove it !</l>
       <l n="35">It is labour , but you love it ;</l>
       <l n="36">Let your stroke be long and mighty ; keep your body on the swing ;</l>
       <l n="37">While your pulses dance a measure</l>
       <l n="38">Full of pride and full of pleasure ,</l>
       <l n="39">And the boat flies free and joyous like a swallow on the wing .</l>

      <head>THE LAST COCK-PHEASANT</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Splendour , whom lately on your glowing flight</l>
       <l n="2">Athwart the chill and cheerless winter-skies</l>
       <l n="3">I marked and welcomed with a futile right ,</l>
       <l n="4">And then a futile left , and strained my eyes</l>
       <l n="5">To see you so magnificently large ,</l>
       <l n="6">Sinking to rest beyond the fir-wood 's marge —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Not mine , not mine the fault : despise me not</l>
       <l n="8">In that I missed you ; for the sun was down ,</l>
       <l n="9">And the dim light was all against the shot ;</l>
       <l n="10">And I had booked a bet of half-a-crown .</l>
       <l n="11">My deadly fire is apt to be upset</l>
       <l n="12">By many causes — always by a bet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">Or had I overdone it with the sloes ,</l>
       <l n="14">Snared by their home-picked brand of ardent gin</l>
       <l n="15">Designed to warm a shivering sportsman 's toes</l>
       <l n="16">And light a fire his reckless head within ?</l>
       <l n="17">Or did my silly loader put me off</l>
       <l n="18">With aimless chatter in regard to golf ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">You too , I think , displayed a lack of nerve ;</l>
       <l n="20">You did not quite-now did you ? - play the game ;</l>
       <l n="21">For when you saw me you were seen to swerve ,</l>
       <l n="22">Doubtless in order to disturb my aim .</l>
       <l n="23">No , no , you must not ask me to forgive</l>
       <l n="24">A swerve because you basely planned to live .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">At any rate I missed you , and you went ,</l>
       <l n="26">The last day 's absolutely final bird ,</l>
       <l n="27">Scathless , and left me very ill content ;</l>
       <l n="28">And someone ( was it I ? ) pronounced a word ,</l>
       <l n="29">A word which rather forcible than nice is ,</l>
       <l n="30">A little word which does not rhyme with Isis .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">Farewell ! I may behold you once again</l>
       <l n="32">When next November 's gales have stripped the leaf .</l>
       <l n="33">Then , while your upward flight you grandly strain ,</l>
       <l n="34">May I be there to add you to my sheaf ;</l>
       <l n="35">And may they praise your tallness , saying “ This</l>
       <l n="36">Was such a bird as men are proud to miss ! ”</l>

      <head>IN MEMORIAM</head>
      <head>FRANCIS COWLEY BURNAND , 1836-1917</head>
      <head>EDITOR OF “ PUNCH , ” 1880-1906</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Hail and Farewell , dear Brother of the Pen ,</l>
       <l n="2">Maker of sunshine for the minds of men ,</l>
       <l n="3">Lord of bright cheer and master of our hearts —</l>
       <l n="4">What plaint is fit when such a friend departs ?</l>
       <l n="5">Not with mere ceremonial words of woe</l>
       <l n="6">Come we to mourn — you would not have it so ;</l>
       <l n="7">But with our memories stored with joyous fun ,</l>
       <l n="8">Your constant largesse till your life was done ,</l>
       <l n="9">With quips , that flashed through frequent twists and bends ,</l>
       <l n="10">Caught from the common intercourse of friends ;</l>
       <l n="11">And gay allusions gayer for the zest</l>
       <l n="12">Of one who hurt no friend and spared no jest .</l>
       <l n="13">What arts were yours that taught you to indite</l>
       <l n="14">What all men thought , but only you could write !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">That wrung from gloom itself a fleeting smile ;</l>
       <l n="16">Rippled with laughter but refrained from guile ;</l>
       <l n="17">Led you to prick some bladder of conceit</l>
       <l n="18">Or trip intrusive folly 's blundering feet ,</l>
       <l n="19">While wisdom at your call came down to earth ,</l>
       <l n="20">Unbent awhile and gave a hand to mirth !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="21">You too had pondered mid your jesting strife</l>
       <l n="22">The deeper issues of our mortal life ;</l>
       <l n="23">Guided to God by faith no doubt could dim ,</l>
       <l n="24">You fought your fight and left the rest to Him ,</l>
       <l n="25">Content to set your heart on things above</l>
       <l n="26">And rule your days by laughter and by love .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="27">Rest in our memories ! You are guarded there</l>
       <l n="28">By those who knew you as you lived and were .</l>
       <l n="29">There mid our Happy Thoughts you take your stand ,</l>
       <l n="30">A sun-girt shade , and light that shadow-land .</l>
