    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">A few words of preface seem necessary in sending out this little book . It is to be looked on as the product of the life of a social worker in England , in his travels , and in Australia . The key-note of the First Part — “ England ” — is desperation , or , if any hope , then “ desperate hope . ” A friend once reported to me a saying of Matthew Arnold 's , that he did not believe in any man of intelligence taking a desperate view of the social problem in England . I am afraid that saying relegates me to the ranks of the fools , but I am content to remain there . I believe that never since 1381 , which is the date of the Peasants ’ Revolt , has England presented such a spectacle of the happiness of the tens , of the misery of the millions . It is not by any means the artisan , or the general or the agricultural labourer , who is the only sufferer . All society groans under the slavery of stupendous toil and a pittance wage . The negro slavery of the Southern States of America was better than the white slavery of to-day all over the earth , but more particularly in Europe and in America . Capitalism is built on the dreadful wrong of recompensing Labour , not according to the worth of its work , but according to the worth of its members in the market of unlimited competition , and that soon comes to mean the payment of what will hold body and soul together when in the enjoyment of health and strength . Landlordism is built on the dreadful wrong of sharing with Capitalism the plunder of Labour . Why are rents high in Australia ? Because here Labour is scarcer , its wages correspondingly higher , and therefore Landlordism steps in to filch from Labour its hard-won comforts , and once more reduce it to the necessities of existence . The American slavers had to spend more in housing and keeping any fixed number of their slaves in serviceable condition than Capitalism spends in wages . Capitalism and Landlordism , like good Christian Institutions , leave the living to keep alive their living , and the dead to bury their dead . This cannot continue for ever . At least all the intelligent portion of the community will grow to see the injustice and attempt to abolish it . But when will the great mass of unintelligent people who have won a large enough share of the plunder of their fellows to minister to their own comforts — when will these , also , awake and see ? England will realize the desperation of her social problem when its desperation is shown her by fire and blood — then , and not till then ! What shall teach her her sins to herself is what is even now teaching her her sins to Ireland .</p>
    <p n="2">I make no apology for several poems in the First Part which are fierce , which are even blood-thirsty . As I felt I wrote , and I will not lessen the truth of what inspired those feelings by eliminating or suppressing the record of them . Rather , let me ask you , whoever you be , to imagine what the cause was , from the effect in one who was ( unhappily ) born and bred into the dominant class , and whose chief care and joy in life was in the pursuit of a culture which draws back instinctively from the violent and the terrible . I will go further . I will arraign my country and my day , because their iniquity would not let me follow out the laws of my nature , which were for luminosity and quiet , for the wide and genial view , but made me “ take arms against a sea of troubles , ” hoping only too often “ by opposing to end them . ” No , we make no apology for bloody sweat and for tears of fire wrung out of us in the Gethsemane and on the Calvary of our country : we make no apology to those whom we have the right to curse .</p>
    <p n="3">In the Second Part — “ Here and There , ” the record of a short trip in the East — the sight of the sin which England has committed not only against herself , against Ireland , against Scotland , but against India , against China , against the sweetest and gentlest people in the earth , the Japanese — the sight of this , and of the signs of England 's doom , the punishment for the abuse of the greatest trust any modern nation has had given to her , inspires a hatred which only that punishment can appease . In the Third Part — “ Australia ” — there is neither ferocity nor blood-thirstiness . Its key-note is hope , hope that dreads but does not despair .</p>
    <p n="4">I may add that in this edition I have sacrificed all merely personal aspects of the poems to attempt to give the book a more complete totality . We know well enough that allowance will rarely be made for any of these things : that our plea for comprehension will too often be an idle one . None the less we make it , for the sake of those who are willing to attempt to realize the social problem and to seek within themselves what they can do for its solution . We have no care whatever as to what view they take of it . Let them be with us or against us , it matters not , if only they will make this effort , if only they will ponder it in their hearts . Ninety-nine out of a hundred of us are concerned in this problem . We are all of us true sons of Labour who have suffered the robbery of the wages of Competition . One word more . The Australian is apt to deprecate the socialism of the European or the American . The darker aspects of the European or American civilization are not striking here . They are here ; they are more than incipient , very much more ; but they are not striking . Let such an one pause . “ We speak of that which we do know , ” and , for the rest , not only do we bid “ him that has ears , to hear , ” but “ him that has eyes , to see . ”</p>
    <p n="5">Brothers all over the earth , brothers and sisters , you of that silent company whose speech is only in the unknown deeds of love , the unknown devotions , the unknown heroisms , it is to you we speak ! Our heart is against your heart ; you can feel it beat . Soul speaks to soul through lips whose utterance is a need . In your room alone , in your lonely walks , in the still hours of day and night , we will be with you . We will speak with you , we will plead with you , for these piteous ones . In the evening trees you shall hear the sound of our weeping . Our sobs shall shake in the wind of wintry nights . We are the spirit of those piteous ones , the wronged , the oppressed , the robbed , the murdered , and we bid you open your warm heart , your light-lit soul to us ! We will thrill you with the clarion of hate and defiance and despair in the tempest of land and sea . You shall listen to us there also . We will touch your eyes and lips with fire . No , we will never let you go , till you are ours and theirs ! And you too , O sufferers , you too shall stay with us , and shall have comfort . Look , we have suffered , we have agonized , we have longed to hasten the hour of rest . But beyond the darkness there is light , beyond the turbulence peace . “ Courage , and be true to one another . ” “ We bid you hope ! ”</p>

    <head>THIS BOOK .</head>
     <l n="1">I give this Book</l>
     <l n="2">TO YOU ,—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Man or woman , girl or boy , labourer , mechanic , clerk , house-servant , whoever you may be , whose wages are not the worth of your work ,— no , nor a fraction of it — whose wages are the minimum which you and those like you , pressed by the desire for life in the dreadful struggle of “ Competition , ” will consent to take from your Employers who , thanks to it , are able thus to rob you :—</p>
   <p>I give it to YOU ,</p>
   <p>in the hope that you may see how you are being robbed ,— how Capital that is won by paying you your competition wages is plunder ,— how Rent that is won by the increased value of land that is owing to the industry of us all , is plunder ,— how the Capitalist and Landowner who over-ride you , how the Master or Mistress who work you from morning to night , who domineer over you as servants and despise you ( or what is worse , pity you ) as beggars , are the men and women whose sole title to this is , that they have the audacity and skill to plunder you , and you the simplicity and folly not to see it and to submit to it :—</p>
   <p>I give this Book to YOU ,</p>
   <p>in the hope that you may at last realize this , and in your own fashion never cease the effort to make your fellow-sufferers realize it :—</p>
   <p>I give it to YOU ,</p>
   <p>in the hope that you may formally enrol yourself in the ranks of the Army of the Night , and that you will offer up the best that has been granted you of heart and soul and mind towards the working out of that better time when , in victorious peace , we silence our drums and trumpets , furl our banners , drag our cannons to their place of rest , and solemnly disarming ourselves , become citizens once more or , if soldiers , then soldiers of the Army of the Day !</p>

     <l n="23">I came to buy a book . It was a shop</l>
     <l n="24">Down in a narrow quiet street , and here</l>
     <l n="25">They kept , I knew , these socialistic books .</l>
     <l n="26">I entered . All was bare , but clean and neat .</l>

     <l n="31">She had a clear and simple face ; I saw</l>
     <l n="32">She had no beauty , loveliness , nor charm ,</l>
     <l n="33">But , as your eyes met those grey light-lit eyes</l>
     <l n="34">Like to a mountain spring so pure , you thought :</l>
     <l n="35">“ He 'd be a clever man who looked , and lied ! ”</l>
     <l n="36">I asked her for the book . . . . We spoke a little . . . .</l>

     <l n="44">Or never woman 's face was ! “ Henry George ? ”</l>

     <l n="46">Such as sprung up in Magdalene 's cheek</l>
     <l n="47">When some voice uttered Jesus , made her angel .</l>
     <l n="48">She turned and pointed up the counter . I ,</l>
     <l n="49">Loosing mine eyes from that ensainted face ,</l>
     <l n="50">Looked also . ‘ Twas a print , a common print ,</l>
     <l n="51">The head and shoulders of some man . She said ,</l>

    <head>TO THE EMPEROR WILLIAM .</head>
    <head>LONDON , May 15 , 1889 .— “ The promised interview with the Emperor William was granted to-day to the delegates from the coal-miners now on strike in Westphalia ; but the audience lasted for only ten minutes . The men asked that the Emperor would inquire into the merits of their case and the hardships under which they suffered . His Majesty replied that he was already inquiring into the matter . He then warned the miners that he would employ all his great powers to repress socialistic agitation and intrigue . If the slightest resistance was shown he would shoot every man so offending . On the other hand , he promised to protect them if peaceable . ” — Cablegram .</head>

   </lg>
   <note>The spectacle of the life of the London Dock labourers is one of the most terrible examples of the logical outcome of the present social system . In the six great metropolitan docks over 100 , 000 men are employed , the great bulk of whom are married and have families . By the elaborate system of sub-contracts their wages have been driven down to 4d ., 3d ., and even 2d . for the few hours they are employed , making the average weekly earnings of a man amount to 7 , 6 , and even 5 shillings a week ! Hundreds and hundreds of lives are lost or ruined every year by the perilous nature of the work , and absolutely without compensation . Yet so fierce is the competition that men are not unfrequently maimed or even killed in the desperate struggles at the gates for the tickets of employment , guaranteeing a “ pay ” which often does not amount to more than a few pence ! The streets and houses inhabited by this unfortunate class are of the lowest kind — haunts of vice , disease , and death , and the monopolistic companies are thus directly able to profit by their wholesale demoralization by ruthlessly crushing out , through the contractors , all efforts at organisation on the part of the men . To see these immense docks , the home of that more immense machine , British Commerce , crowded with huge and stately ships , steamers , and sailors the first in the world , and to watch with intelligent eyes by what means the colossal work of loading and unloading them is carried out ; this is to face a sacrificial orgy of human life — childhood , youth , manhood , womanhood , and age , with everything that makes them beautiful and ennobling , and not merely a misery and a curse — far more appalling than any Juggernaut progress or the human holocausts that were offered up to Moloch .</note>

     <l n="16">That carries away from the shambles the refuse of flesh and brain —</l>
     <l n="17">There rose up slowly before me , in the dome of the city 's light ,</l>
     <l n="18">A vast and shadowy Substance , with shafts and wheels of might ,</l>
     <l n="19">Tremendous , ruthless , fatal ; and I knew the visible shape</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">It stood there high in the heavens , fronting the face of God ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the spray it sprinkled had blasted the green and flowery sod</l>
     <l n="23">All round where , through stony precincts , its Cyclopean pillars fell</l>
     <l n="24">To its adamantine foundations that were fixed in the womb of hell .</l>
     <l n="25">And the birds that , wild and whirling , and moth-like , flew to its</l>
     <l n="26">glare</l>
     <l n="27">Were struck by the flying wheel-spokes , and maimed and murdered there ;</l>
     <l n="28">And the dust that swept about its black panoply overhead ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="30">But mine eyes were fixed on the people that sought this horrible den ,</l>
     <l n="31">And they mounted in thronged battalions , children and women and men ,</l>
     <l n="32">Right out from the low horizons , more far than the eye could see ,</l>
     <l n="33">From the north and the south and the east and the west , they came</l>
     <l n="34">perpetually —</l>
     <l n="35">Some silent , some raving , some sobbing , some laughing , some cursing ,</l>
     <l n="36">some crying ,</l>
     <l n="37">Some alone , some with others , some struggling , some dragging the dead</l>
     <l n="38">and the dying</l>
     <l n="39">Up to the central Wheel enormous with its wild devouring breath</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">Then suddenly , as I watched it all , a keen wind blew amain ,</l>
     <l n="42">And the air grew clearer and purer , and I could see it plain —</l>
     <l n="43">How under the central Wheel a black stone Altar stood ,</l>
     <l n="44">And a great , gold Idol upon it was gleaming like fiery blood .</l>
     <l n="45">And there , in front of the Altar , was a huge , round lurid Pit ,</l>
     <l n="46">And the thronged battalions were marching to the yawning mouth of it</l>
     <l n="47">In the clangour of the Machinery and the Wheel 's devouring breath</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">And once again as I gazed there , and the keen wind still blew on ,</l>

     <l n="51">Yet crowned and more terrific thus for his human fleshly loss ,</l>
     <l n="52">And with one clenched hand he brandished a lash , and the other held up</l>
     <l n="53">a cross !</l>
     <l n="54">And all around the Altar were seated , joyous and free ,</l>
     <l n="55">In garments richly-coloured and choice , a goodly company ,</l>
     <l n="56">Eating and drinking and wantoning , like gods that scorned to know</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="58">Ah , Christ ! the sights and the sounds there that every hour befell</l>

     <l n="70">When slowly , slowly emerging , I saw a great Globe rise ,</l>
     <l n="71">Blood-red on the dim horizon , and it swam up into the skies .</l>
     <l n="72">But whether indeed it were the sun or the moon , I could not say ,</l>
     <l n="73">For I knew not now in my watching if it were night or day .</l>
     <l n="74">But when that Great Globe steadied above the central Wheel ,</l>
     <l n="75">The thronged battalions wavered and paused , and an awful silence fell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="76">Then ( I know not how , but so it was ) in a moment the flash of an eye —</l>
     <l n="77">A murmur ran and rose to a voice , and the voice to a terrible cry :</l>
     <l n="78">“ Enough , enough ! It has had enough ! We will march no more till we</l>

     <l n="82">And then , with a shout of angry fear , the Revellers sprang to their</l>
     <l n="83">feet ,</l>
     <l n="84">And the call was for cannon and cavalry , for rifle and bayonet .</l>
     <l n="85">And one rose up , a leader of them , lifting a threatening rod .</l>
     <l n="86">And “ Stop the Machinery ! ” he yelled , “ you might as well stop God ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But the terrible thunder-cry replied : “ If this indeed must be , It is YOU should be cast to the furnace Pit to feed the Machine — not WE ! ” And the central Wheel enormous slowed down in groaning plight , And all the aerial movement ceased of the shafts and wheels of might , And a superhuman clamour leaped madly to where overhead The great Globe swung in the gathering gloom , portentous , huge , blood-red ! But my brain whirled round and my blinded eyes no more could see or know , Till I struggling seemed to awake at last by the swollen , sullen flow Of the dreadful river that rolls her tides through the City of Wealth and Woe !</p>

   <note>AUSTRALIAN PRESS NOTICES . “ This volume holds within its slim covers more restrained power , inward , incisive vision , and passionate pity than any volume of verse that has seen the light in the Southern Hemisphere ( always , of course , excepting the complete ‘ Poetical Works ’ of the same author ) . That is a bewildering book , a veritable thousand islands of passion , pathos , poetry , set in a restless , weary sea . . . The uncontrollable out-bursts of a noble , tender soul maddened by the misery and hypocrisy of our cannibal civilisation , This putrid death , This flesh-feast of the few , This social structure of red mud , This edifice of slime , Whose bricks are bones , whose mortar blood , Whose pinnacle is crime ! Hemorrhages from the very vitals of one tortured in Hell . Not the quaint conglomeration of bottomless brimstone and three-tined forks , but the now non-exploding self-adjusting patent Hell ‘ of our own manufacture , ’ whose seventh hopeless circle centres in the old village by the Thames — ( trade mark , ‘ Commerce and Christ . ’ ) ” — SYDNEY JEPHCOTT , “ Australian Standard . ” AN AUSTRALIAN POET . “ Francis Adams is about the least Australian of the Australian poets . There is in his work lack of wattle-bloom and waratah , rollicking rhyme and galloping jingle . There is much of old-world problems and old-world troubles , which are old-world simply because we here have not had time enough to breed the fever germ to a ravaging pestilence . We have , however , the fever germ , and Francis Adams does our young country yeoman service in awakening a fear for the future in his latest book of poems , ‘ Songs of the Army of the Night . ’ The book is not all night though . It is a cantata without music . The first part is all gloom ; angry threatening clouds bar out the light of the coming dawn ; footsteps of the weary and fallen plash along in the mud and darkness ; the lightning of angry steel , gleaming phosphorescent in the night ; the hoarse hum of famished millions moiling along with a dim yearning for a bloody vengeance , contribute the details of a grim picture of realistic misery . The first part deserves the title given to the whole book , ‘ Songs of the Army of the Night . ’ The third part is perturbed and stormy , the sea heaving and surging after a tempest ; but already the day is breaking , and young hope is felt in the warmth of the sun 's first rays . The third part might be justly termed ‘ Songs of the Dawn . ’ The second part is hot and heavy with the languorous heat of the tropics . . . . The whole book is a hymn in praise of fodder . The people march hungry , hoarse with lack of sustenance , gripping their firelocks with feverish , skeleton hands , glaring fiercely with famished eyes towards the granaries of the wealthy . . . . This is the sermon of Nature : ‘ If you would be good , eat . ’ It is in the first part that we hear the trumpet-blast of the social message . Here the verses throb with a realistic agony , a lyric Zolaism , that chains the eyes to the page with a virile fascination . It is so simple , too — the coarse , strong meat of the poetry of first principles . The lines are hot and fervid ; the poet 's pulses keep time with the great heart of human woe . This is socialism in verse , anarchism in the guise of a Grecian statue . ‘ Outside London ’ breathes thick and heavy with the vapours of gutterdom . It is despair , hunger , prophecy , hate , revenge . Francis Adams , a ripe and true scholar , in this shows his devotion to truth and to art . The traditions of classicism are in this volume thrown to the winds . The poet 's muse is a glorified street trull , a Cassandra of the slums , a draggle-tailed Menad from Whitechapel , and her voice is thick and frenzied with shouting at the barricades . ‘ The Evening Hymn in the Hovels , ’ ‘ Hagar , ’ ‘ To the Girls of the Unions , ’ ‘ In the Edgware Road , ’ ‘ In Trafalgar Square , ’ ‘ Aux Ternes , ’ ‘ One among so many , ’ ‘ The New Locksley Hall , ’ ‘ To the Christians , ’ voice in passionate , simple people 's lyrics the socialism which is always felt in strong under-currents by a nation before it appears in literary form , but which is only on the eve of bursting forth and overwhelming everything with its fury , when it does appear in literary form . Rosseau , Voltaire , and Diderot ushered in the French Revolution ; in similar fashion the English Revolution is heralded by William Morris and Francis Adams . ” — F. J. BROOMFIELD , Sydney Bulletin . “ DAWNWARDS ? ”</note>
   <div type="otherbooks">
    <p>To the Author of the “ Songs of the Army of the Night . ” We — who , encircled in sleepless sadness With ears laid close to the Austral earth , Have heard far cries of wrong-wrought madness , Of hopeless anguish and murd'rous mirth Beneath all noise of maudlin gladness Awail , environ the world 's wide girth — Almost arise with Hope 's keen urging When out the vasty and night-bound North Red rays ascend , and Songs resurging Through all the darkness and chill , come forth ! The comet climbs until it scorches The sacred dais that skies the great , Until it gleams on palace porches , Where blissful aeons-to-be hold state — Fades , and we know it one of the torches Madmen a moment elevate ! And , closer clutching the earth , our sorrow Doth then with desperate murmur cry , “ We ne'er shall see or morn or morrow ! For never star doth scale the sky , “ All men made wise through midnight sable To lead where , safe after all annoy , Sleep soft in earth 's Augean stable The virgin “ Justice , ” the infant “ Joy ! ” — Grant this , O Father , being able , Or else in merciful might destroy “ This orb whose past and present , awful Alike , attest it a torture wheel , Where , bound by holy men and lawful , Man 's body 's broken with bars of steel ! ” But when we pause , despairing wholly , As a storm that strengthens out on the sea , The far-flown SONGS come sounding slowly ! As sea-birds kindle that sweep alee New hopes , old yearnings winging slowly From breast to bosom for shelter flee ! And scarce we know , as there they hover And our blood beats ‘ neath their beating wings , If ‘ tis an old dream earthed over Or new bird-ballad that stirs and sings ! But truth 's Tyrtaeus is now our neighbour , And strives to waken the slumbering South With peal and throb of trump and tabour And sobbing songs of his mournful mouth To see where Life 's all-giver , Labour , Lies fettered , famished and dumb with drouth .

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">{ 27 } In The New Arcadia Miss Robinson devoted to the Cause of Labour a dilettante little book that had not even one note of the true , the sweet and lovely poetry of her deeper impulses . There is the amateur , and the female amateur , no less in perception and emotion than in the technical aspects of our art , and we want no more flimsy “ sympathetic ” rigmaroles , like “ The Cry of the Children , ” or “ A Song for the Ragged Schools of London , ” from those who , in the portraiture of the divine simple woman 's soul within them , can give us poetry complete , genuine , everlasting .</p>
    <p n="2">{ 32 } His attack on George Eliot in “ Fiction , Fair and Foul , ” in the Nineteenth Century , for instance .</p>
    <p n="3">{ 33 } The attack on Missionary Ridge is an example of the brilliant initiative , as the holding of the Bloody Angle in the Wilderness is of the dauntless resolution , of the army of the Democracy of the United States , while the last attacks on Richmond were the final exploit of the conqueror of two combatants , of whom it is enough to say that they were worthy of one another .</p>
    <p n="4">{ 35 } Something like an adequate account of this great revolution manquee , which in England and 1381 went near to anticipating France and 1793 , has at last found its place in the historian 's pages , and Longland the poet , Ball the preacher , and Tyler the man of action , who first raised for us the democratic demand , can be seen somewhat as they were . This , and more , we owe to John Richard Green . An account of the Revolt will be found in section 4 of chapter 5 of his “ Short History of the English People . ” The phrases in verses 3 and 5 were catchwords among the revolters .</p>
    <p n="5">{ 36 } After dismissing the peasants with the formally written acknowledgment of their freedom and rights , Richard II . with an army of 40 , 000 followers avenged himself and his lords by ruthless and prolonged massacres over the whole country .</p>
    <p n="6">{ 38 } Who owns , and rack-rents , some of the vilest slums in London , and is beautifully aesthetic in private life .</p>
    <p n="7">{ 39a } The French .</p>
    <p n="8">{ 39b } “ Voe victis ! ” woe to the conquered — the motto of the Gauls in Rome as of the modern Civilization of Land and Capital .</p>
    <p n="9">{ 44 } France .</p>
    <p n="10">{ 45 } In Pere-la-Chaise , the famous Parisian cemetery , the Communists made a desperate stand , but were overcome and the captured ones shot . And Morny 's vaulted tomb was close at hand , and Balzac smiled his animal cynicism from his bust . Victims , murderer , and commenting Chorus , all were there .</p>
    <p n="11">{ 46 } A part of Paris .</p>
    <p n="12">{ 49 } The New Model is the name by which is known that reorganization of the Roundhead Army , without which Cromwell saw that the Cavaliers could not be conquered . No one was permitted in its ranks who did not thoroughly believe in the Cause for which it fought .</p>
    <p n="13">{ 66 } This graveyard , one side of a gully , which suddenly expands and leaves its base large enough for the local race-course , is in summer one of the loveliest spots on earth . Hindoos , Protestants , Catholics , and Mahommadan have their separate portions . Here in regimental or individual tombs are the record of noble lives thrown away in the iniquity of the English relations with China .</p>
    <p n="14">{ 69a } The Russian tea-urn .</p>
    <p n="15">{ 69b } In China the system of Trades Unions is admirable .— Coolie is the generic term in the East for labourer .</p>
    <p n="16">{ 70 } This is one of the three well-known colossi of Gautama , the Buddha . The same type of proud patience marks this embodiment of the suffering East , wherever we meet it .</p>
    <p n="17">{ 76 } Dr Moorhouse came out to Melbourne as bishop in the Church of England there in 1876 . He almost immediately took the position of the leading religious personality in Australia . To a rare geniality he added the gifts of a “ scholar ” and a “ gentleman , ” both real and both as modern as yet seems permitted to the old caste and religion . He achieved an influence over men of all denominations , and of none , that was quite phenomenal , and might have been used for a national object as great as good . The work of his diocese , however , proving too much for his strength , he announced the fact , and declared that , unless his bishopric were divided , he would be compelled to resign it . Shortly afterwards he accepted the bishopric of Manchester , on the ground that “ a larger sphere of labour had been offered to him unsolicited . ” His departure was a sort of national event .</p>
    <p n="18">{ 79a } Orang-utan .</p>
