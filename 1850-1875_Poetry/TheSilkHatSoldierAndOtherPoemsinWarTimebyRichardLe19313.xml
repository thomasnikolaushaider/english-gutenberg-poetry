     <l n="16">I saw him in a picture , and I felt I 'd like to cry —</l>
     <l n="17">He stood in line ,</l>
     <l n="18">The man “ for mine , ”</l>
     <l n="19">A tall silk-hatted “ guy ” —</l>
     <l n="20">Right on the call ,</l>
     <l n="21">Silk hat and all ,</l>
     <l n="22">He 'd hurried to the cry —</l>
     <l n="23">For he loves England well enough for England to die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="24">I 've seen King Harry 's helmet in the Abbey hanging high —</l>

     <l n="29">Too keen to doff</l>
     <l n="30">His stove-pipe — bless him — why ?</l>

     <l n="32">And other fellows in that line had come too on the fly ,</l>

     <l n="40">One threw his cricket-bat aside , one left the ink to dry ;</l>

    <head>THE CRY OF THE LITTLE PEOPLES</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Cry of the Little Peoples went up to God in vain ;</l>
     <l n="2">The Czech and the Pole , and the Finn , and the Schleswig Dane :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">We ask but a little portion of the green , ambitious earth ;</l>
     <l n="4">Only to sow and sing and reap in the land of our birth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">We ask not coaling stations , nor ports in the China seas ,</l>
     <l n="6">We leave to the big child-nations such rivalries as these .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">We have learned the lesson of Time , and we know three things of worth ;</l>
     <l n="8">Only to sow and sing and reap in the land of our birth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="9">O leave us little margins , waste ends of land and sea ,</l>
     <l n="10">A little grass , and a hill or two , and a shadowing tree ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="11">O leave us our little rivers that sweetly catch the sky ,</l>
     <l n="12">To drive our mills , and to carry our wood , and to ripple by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="13">Once long ago , as you , with hollow pursuit of fame ,</l>
     <l n="14">We filled all the shaking world with the sound of our name ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="15">But now are we glad to rest , our battles and boasting done ,</l>
     <l n="16">Glad just to sow and sing and reap in our share of the sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="17">Of this O will ye rob us ,— with a foolish mighty hand ,</l>
     <l n="18">Add with such cruel sorrow , so small a land to your land ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="19">So might a boy rejoice him to conquer a hive of bees ,</l>
     <l n="20">Overcome ants in battle ,— we are scarcely more mighty than these —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="21">So might a cruel heart hear a nightingale singing alone ,</l>
     <l n="22">And say , “ I am mighty ! See how the singing stops with a stone ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="23">Yea , he were mighty indeed , mighty to crush and to gain ;</l>
     <l n="24">But the bee and the ant and the bird were the mighty of brain .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And what shall you gain if you take us and bind us and beat us with thongs , And drive us to sing underground in a whisper our sad little songs ?</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Forbid us the very use of our heart 's own nursery tongue —</l>
     <l n="2">Is this to be strong , ye nations , is this to be strong ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Your vulgar battles to fight , and your grocery conquests to keep ,</l>
     <l n="4">For this shall we break our hearts , for this shall our old men weep ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">What gain in the day of battle — to the Russ , to the German , what gain ,</l>
     <l n="6">The Czech , and the Pole , and the Finn , and the Schleswig Dane ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">The Cry of the Little Peoples goes up to God in vain ,</l>
     <l n="8">For the world is given over to the cruel sons of Cain ;</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The hand that would bless us is weak , and the hand that would break us is strong , And the power of pity is nought but the power of a song .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The dreams that our fathers dreamed to-day are laughter and dust ,</l>
     <l n="2">And nothing at all in the world is left for a man to trust ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Let us hope no more , or dream , or prophesy , or pray ,</l>
     <l n="4">For the iron world no less will crash on its iron way ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Yea ! nothing is left but to watch , with a helpless , pitying eye ,</l>
     <l n="6">The kind old aims for the world , and the kind old fashions die .</l>

     <l n="1">War</l>
     <l n="2">I abhor ,</l>
     <l n="3">And yet how sweet</l>
     <l n="4">The sound along the marching street</l>
     <l n="5">Of drum and fife , and I forget</l>
     <l n="6">Wet eyes of widows , and forget</l>
     <l n="7">Broken old mothers , and the whole</l>
     <l n="8">Dark butchery without a soul .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Without a soul — save this bright drink</l>
     <l n="10">Of heady music , sweet as hell ;</l>
     <l n="11">And even my peace-abiding feet</l>
     <l n="12">Go marching with the marching street ,</l>
     <l n="13">For yonder , yonder goes the fife ,</l>
     <l n="14">And what care I for human life !</l>
     <l n="15">The tears fill my astonished eyes</l>
     <l n="16">And my full heart is like to break ,</l>
     <l n="17">And yet ‘ tis all embannered lies ,</l>
     <l n="18">A dream those little drummers make .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">O it is wickedness to clothe</l>
     <l n="20">Yon hideous grinning thing that stalks</l>
     <l n="21">Hidden in music , like a queen</l>
     <l n="22">That in a garden of glory walks ,</l>
     <l n="23">Till good men love the thing they loathe .</l>
     <l n="24">Art , thou hast many infamies ,</l>
     <l n="25">But not an infamy like this ;</l>
     <l n="26">O snap the fife and still the drum ,</l>
     <l n="27">And show the monster as she is .</l>

     <l n="93">Soldier coming from the war —</l>
     <l n="94">When the street is one wide sea ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ These things are real , ” said one , and bade me gaze</l>
     <l n="2">On black and mighty shapes of iron and stone ,</l>
     <l n="3">On murder , on madness , on lust , on towns ablaze ,</l>
     <l n="4">And on a thing made all of rattling bone :</l>
     <l n="5">“ What , ” said he , “ will you bring to match with these ? ”</l>
     <l n="6">“ Yea ! War is real , ” I said , “ and real is Death ,</l>
     <l n="7">A little while — mortal realities ;</l>
     <l n="8">But Love and Hope draw an immortal breath . ”</l>

     <l n="9">Think you the storm that wrecks a summer day ,</l>
     <l n="10">With funeral blackness and with leaping fire</l>
     <l n="11">And boiling roar of rain , more real than they</l>
     <l n="12">That , when the warring heavens begin to tire ,</l>
     <l n="13">With tender fingers on the tumult paint ;</l>
     <l n="14">Spanning the huddled wrack from base to cope</l>
     <l n="15">With soft effulgence , like some haloed saint ,—</l>
     <l n="16">The rainbow bridge eternal that is Hope .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Deem her no phantom born of desperate dreams :</l>
     <l n="18">Ere man yet was , ‘ twas hope that wrought him man ;</l>
     <l n="19">The blind earth , climbing skyward by her gleams ,</l>
     <l n="20">Hoped — and the beauty of the world began .</l>
     <l n="21">Prophetic of all loveliness to be ,</l>
     <l n="22">Though God Himself seem from His station hurled ,</l>
     <l n="23">Still shall the blackest hell look up and see</l>
     <l n="24">Hope 's rainbow on the summits of the world .</l>
