    <head>THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOM</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The old log house where Margaret lived , whose roof had mossy grown ,</l>
     <l n="2">Reposed amid its clump of trees , a queen upon her throne .</l>
     <l n="3">The landscape round smiled proudly and the flowers shed sweet perfume ,</l>
     <l n="4">When Margaret plied the shuttle of the rude old-fashioned loom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The world has grown fastidious — demands things ever new —</l>
     <l n="6">But we could once see beauties in the rainbow 's every hue ;</l>
     <l n="7">The bee could then find nectar in a common clover bloom ,</l>
     <l n="8">And simple hearts hear music in the shuttle of the loom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The picture that my memory paints is never seen to-day —</l>
     <l n="10">The April sun of by-gone years has lost its brightest ray :</l>
     <l n="11">A fancy-wrought piano in a quaint , antique old room ,</l>
     <l n="12">But Margaret sang her sweetest to the music of the loom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">She wore a simple home-spun dress , for Margaret 's taste was plain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Yet life was like a song to her , with work a sweet refrain .</l>
     <l n="15">The sunshine filled her days with joy , night 's shadows brought</l>
     <l n="16">no gloom .</l>
     <l n="17">When Margaret plied the shuttle of the old old-fashioned loom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">Her warp of life was toiling hard , but love its beauteous woof .</l>
     <l n="19">The web she wove , a character beyond the world 's reproof .</l>
     <l n="20">O girls of wealth and beauty vain , who dress in rich costume ,</l>
     <l n="21">How sweet the shuttle 's music of this rare old-fashioned loom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="22">The world may grow fastidious in art and nature too ,</l>
     <l n="23">And say there is no beauty in the rainbow 's every hue ;</l>
     <l n="24">And yet the bee finds nectar in a common clover bloom ,</l>
     <l n="25">And I still love the music of the old old-fashioned loom .</l>

    <head>THE OLD OLD CLOCK</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dear old Old Clock , thy grave tick tock</l>
     <l n="2">I heard in my childhood days ,</l>
     <l n="3">In the solemn night , when the fire burned bright ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the lamp cast feeble rays ;</l>
     <l n="5">When grandmother close by the mantelpiece ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sat dozing or knitting , or carding fleece ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or watching the dying blaze ;</l>
     <l n="8">When mother was young and her beautiful hair</l>
     <l n="9">Had never a silver thread ;</l>
     <l n="10">When her life was fair as her love was rare ,</l>
     <l n="11">In the years that have swiftly sped .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">Thy grave tick tock , dear old Old Clock ,</l>
     <l n="13">Unchanged through the changing years ,</l>
     <l n="14">Still beating time in a ceaseless rhyme</l>
     <l n="15">To the dirge of the rolling spheres ,—</l>
     <l n="16">Unmindful that she by the mantelpiece</l>
     <l n="17">Is gone with her knitting and carding fleece ,—</l>
     <l n="18">Unmoved by our sorrowing tears —</l>
     <l n="19">Brings back the days when mother 's hair</l>
     <l n="20">Had never a silver thread ,</l>
     <l n="21">And the life still fair in its beauty rare</l>
     <l n="22">When the snows had crowned her head .</l>

    <head>THE OLD SPINNING WHEEL</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A cabin ! It nestled amid the green hills</l>
     <l n="2">Where grew no bramble or thistle ,—</l>
     <l n="3">Mid meadows melodious with music and trills</l>
     <l n="4">And song that the wild-throated mocking bird spills</l>
     <l n="5">On the air from his marvelous whistle .</l>
     <l n="6">No carpets were seen on the broad puncheon floors ,</l>
     <l n="7">No paintings that wealth would reveal ;</l>
     <l n="8">But a statue was there that Art can not know ,</l>
     <l n="9">That filled the rude room with a musical glow ,—</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Twas Ruth at the Old Spinning Wheel !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Long years have passed by ; its music was stilled</l>
     <l n="12">At rattle and whirr of machinery .</l>
     <l n="13">And the pea-fowl now screams where the mocking bird trilled ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the landscape is dead where once the heart thrilled</l>
     <l n="15">At wildwood and picturesque scenery .</l>
     <l n="16">The opera may boast the diva of song ,</l>
     <l n="17">To me she makes no appeal ;</l>
     <l n="18">To flute obligato my heart is still dumb ,</l>
     <l n="19">But oh ! for the song and musical hum</l>
     <l n="20">Of Ruth and the Old Spinning Wheel !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">She lived but a simple , plain rustic life ,</l>
     <l n="22">Yet charming in sooth was her beauty .</l>
     <l n="23">In her untutored heart was love ever rife ,</l>
     <l n="24">The seat of no conflict , no struggle or strife</l>
     <l n="25">‘ Twixt a selfish will and duty .</l>
     <l n="26">I bow at her altar of beauty and truth ,</l>
     <l n="27">At the shrine of her heart do I kneel ,</l>
     <l n="28">With a prayer no mortal ever lifted above ,</l>
     <l n="29">Till my soul is atune with the music of love</l>
     <l n="30">She sings to the Old Spinning Wheel !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">This unlettered maiden was poor , but high-bred ,</l>
     <l n="32">Oh , women of fashion far above you !</l>
     <l n="33">And I thrilled at the graceful poise of her head</l>
     <l n="34">And the radiant smile of my love when she said ,</l>
     <l n="35">“ Why James , you know that I love you . ”</l>
     <l n="36">Nymph-like her lithe form swayed as in dance ,</l>
     <l n="37">I awkwardly sat at the reel —</l>
     <l n="38">A moment 's surcease of monotonous thrum ,—</l>
     <l n="39">Melodious the lull in the song and the hum</l>
     <l n="40">Of Ruth and the Old Spinning Wheel !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">The glow of the incandescent light</l>
     <l n="42">Has banished the tallow candle ;</l>
     <l n="43">And the ox-cart is gone at steam 's rapid flight ,</l>
     <l n="44">But Love is too subtle , is too recondite</l>
     <l n="45">For Learning or Genius to handle .</l>
     <l n="46">All honor to Science , let her keep her mad pace ,</l>
     <l n="47">I abate not a tittle her zeal ;</l>
     <l n="48">But the splendors of life can never efface</l>
     <l n="49">The picture of Ruth in plain rustic grace</l>
     <l n="50">Who wrought at the Old Spinning Wheel !</l>

    <head>THE OLD WATER MILL</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Twas grinding day at the Old Water Mill ,</l>
     <l n="2">But holiday with me ,</l>
     <l n="3">For I knew ere I reached the foot of the hill</l>
     <l n="4">And heard the voice of the happy rill ,</l>
     <l n="5">The miller 's beautiful child was there</l>
     <l n="6">That wore the tresses of sun-lit hair</l>
     <l n="7">And smile of witchery ;</l>
     <l n="8">And the twittering swallows awhirl in the air ,</l>
     <l n="9">Told in their ecstacy</l>
     <l n="10">That Rachel , the Golden Daffodil ,</l>
     <l n="11">Was blooming again by the Old Water Mill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">Together we cross the moss-covered log</l>
     <l n="13">That spans the old mill race ,</l>
     <l n="14">And we hear through the mists and rising fog</l>
     <l n="15">The boom of the dam , the croak of the frog ,</l>
     <l n="16">That wakes , on the banks of the glinting stream ,</l>
     <l n="17">The violet tranced in her winter dream ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where lights and shadows lace ;</l>
     <l n="19">And the cowslip , like the meteor 's gleam ,</l>
     <l n="20">Darts from her hiding-place ,</l>
     <l n="21">While the cataracts leap in their haste to fill</l>
     <l n="22">The floats of the wheel at the Old Water Mill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">We sit by the dam of the placid stream</l>
     <l n="24">And watch the whirl and churn</l>
     <l n="25">Of the pouring floods that bubble and steam</l>
     <l n="26">And glitter and flash in the bright sunbeam ,</l>
     <l n="27">While steadily rolls the dripping wheel</l>
     <l n="28">That slowly grinds the farmers ’ meal ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who restless wait their turn ;</l>
     <l n="30">But the lights in the miller 's face reveal</l>
     <l n="31">Never the least concern ,</l>
     <l n="32">Who takes his toll , and whistles until</l>
     <l n="33">The hopper is drained at the Old Water Mill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">To-day we passed where the Old Water Mill</l>
     <l n="35">Had stood in the long ago ,</l>
     <l n="36">But the cataracts leap no more on the hill ,</l>
     <l n="37">And the boom of the roaring dam is still ,</l>
     <l n="38">For the gleaming stream in its grief went dry ,</l>
     <l n="39">When the ruthless hand of Art passed by</l>
     <l n="40">And laid the Old Mill low ;</l>
     <l n="41">And the violets , cold in death , now lie</l>
     <l n="42">Wrapped in the glistening snow ;</l>
     <l n="43">And the biting air is crisp and chill</l>
     <l n="44">Around the ruins of the Old Water Mill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">And now we sit by the River of Time</l>
     <l n="46">And gaze at the waves below ,</l>
     <l n="47">But its brink is covered by frost and rime ,</l>
     <l n="48">And we hear on the wind a muffled chime</l>
     <l n="49">Proclaiming the end of a brief sojourn :</l>
     <l n="50">Yet the floods of life still whirl and churn</l>
     <l n="51">As the currents ebb and flow :—</l>
     <l n="52">By the rolling wheel we wait our turn</l>
     <l n="53">Calm , but ready to go !</l>
     <l n="54">The hopper is drained , but unmoved still ,</l>
     <l n="55">The Miller who grinds in Time 's Water Mill .</l>

     <l n="1">A meeting-house , no church at all ,</l>
     <l n="2">With stained cathedral glass ,</l>
     <l n="3">With lofty spire and arching hall ,</l>
     <l n="4">And terraced lawns of grass :</l>
     <l n="5">No organ peals , no chanting choir ,</l>
     <l n="6">No frescoed walls that men admire</l>
     <l n="7">Had this old meeting-house ;</l>
     <l n="8">But roses wild their petals piled</l>
     <l n="9">About its sacred door ,</l>
     <l n="10">And locust bloom shed rich perfume ,</l>

     <l n="13">It stood upon a limpid stream</l>
     <l n="14">My childhood thought divine ,</l>
     <l n="15">Whose waters pure did ever gleam</l>
     <l n="16">Like shimmering shine of wine ;</l>
     <l n="17">It stood , alas ! but stands no more</l>
     <l n="18">Upon the bank or pebbly shore</l>
     <l n="19">Of sunny Pleasant Run ;</l>
     <l n="20">Yet in my dreams , it often seems</l>
     <l n="21">I see thee , Waterloo ,</l>

     <l n="6">The old Old Swing , the fields of golden maize ;</l>
     <l n="7">The moving pictures in the clouds above ;</l>
     <l n="8">The mating birds , their nests , their songs of love —</l>

     <l n="10">And then I turn and look beyond the Shade ,</l>

     <l n="12">Our mothers with their crowns of silver hair ,</l>
     <l n="13">And radiant smiles of love that will not fade ;</l>

    <head>A HANK OF HOMESPUN</head>
    <head>THE SCHOOL OF SKINNY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Have you never heard the story of the good old country school</l>
     <l n="2">With its rude split-bottomed benches and its ancient dunce 's stool ?</l>
     <l n="3">Where Webster 's Blue-back Speller was the only standard text ,</l>
     <l n="4">And supplied the place of grammar that our late forefathers vexed ;</l>
     <l n="5">Where they never heard of Latin or the Greek subjunctive mode ,</l>
     <l n="6">But sang their mult-plication like a patriotic ode ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">The Master , he was skinny , with a lean and hungry look ;</l>
     <l n="8">And a countenance as placid as a frozen winter brook ;</l>
     <l n="9">His brow was broad and Grecian , and his eye was snell and keen ,</l>
     <l n="10">And his head was stuffed with knowledge of a dozen books , I ween ;</l>
     <l n="11">And they say his nose was Roman as the bill of any hawk ,</l>
     <l n="12">And his boys were all perfection , for they had to walk the chalk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">And yet I 've often wondered if they really always walked ,</l>
     <l n="14">And sat upright like statues , and never laughed or talked ,</l>
     <l n="15">For I 've often heard my father say the model of the school</l>
     <l n="16">Got licked at least three times a day as a pretty general rule ,</l>
     <l n="17">And lament the good old method , as a lost , forgotten art ,</l>
     <l n="18">Of imparting knowledge in a way that made a fellow smart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">I wish we had the secret now of making boys walk</l>
     <l n="20">Instead of always watching for a chance to throw some chalk ;</l>
     <l n="21">But the art , I think , was buried with the Blue-back Spelling Book ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the piercing eye of Skinny , that no mortal boy could brook ;</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Twas buried with the benches and the ancient dunce 's stool</l>
     <l n="24">And the grease-glazed paper windows of the good old country school .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">It may be through psychology and molly-coddle stuff ,</l>
     <l n="26">We often talk in institutes , we 've lost the power to bluff ;</l>
     <l n="27">Perhaps ‘ twas Pestalozzi , Froebel and John Herbart</l>
     <l n="28">Who robbed the wand of Skinny of its pedagogic art ;</l>
     <l n="29">We 'll not discuss philosophy , but we know about the chalk ,</l>
     <l n="30">That no theoretic dream of man can make a boy walk .</l>
