   <p>REVIEW</p>
   <p>Do you live in the city ? Have you ever seen a farm ? What does a farmer do ? Where do the birds go in winter ? When does the sun shine ? When does the snow fall ? What is as white as snow ? Why would you like to be a sailor ? Why do you love your home ? Where do the fishes live ? What can Bennie build with sand ? How does Robert 's mother make butter ? What do boys and girls do at school ? What does the clock tell Marian ? What things are made of wood ? What do you do on Christmas day ?</p>
