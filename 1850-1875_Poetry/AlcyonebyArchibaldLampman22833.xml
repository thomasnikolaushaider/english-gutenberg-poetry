       <l n="1">The sun falls warm : the southern winds awake :</l>
       <l n="2">The air seethes upward with a steamy shiver :</l>
       <l n="3">Each dip of the road is now a crystal lake ,</l>
       <l n="4">And every rut a little dancing river .</l>
       <l n="5">Through great soft clouds that sunder overhead</l>
       <l n="6">The deep sky breaks as pearly blue as summer :</l>
       <l n="7">Out of a cleft beside the river 's bed</l>
       <l n="8">Flaps the black crow , the first demure newcomer .</l>
       <l n="9">The last seared drifts are eating fast away</l>
       <l n="10">With glassy tinkle into glittering laces :</l>
       <l n="11">Dogs lie asleep , and little children play</l>
       <l n="12">With tops and marbles in the sunbare places ;</l>
       <l n="13">And I that stroll with many a thoughtful pause</l>
       <l n="14">Almost forget that winter ever was .</l>

       <l n="1">Beside the pounding cataracts</l>

       <l n="4">And valleys huge of Tartarus .</l>
       <l n="5">Lurid and lofty and vast it seems ;</l>
       <l n="6">It hath no rounded name that rings ,</l>
       <l n="7">But I have heard it called in dreams</l>
       <l n="8">The City of the End of Things .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Its roofs and iron towers have grown</l>
       <l n="10">None knoweth how high within the night ,</l>
       <l n="11">But in its murky streets far down</l>
       <l n="12">A flaming terrible and bright</l>
       <l n="13">Shakes all the stalking shadows there ,</l>
       <l n="14">Across the walls , across the floors ,</l>
       <l n="15">And shifts upon the upper air</l>
       <l n="16">From out a thousand furnace doors ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">And all the while an awful sound</l>
       <l n="18">Keeps roaring on continually ,</l>
       <l n="19">And crashes in the ceaseless round</l>
       <l n="20">Of a gigantic harmony .</l>
       <l n="21">Through its grim depths re-echoing</l>
       <l n="22">And all its weary height of walls ,</l>
       <l n="23">With measured roar and iron ring ,</l>
       <l n="24">The inhuman music lifts and falls .</l>
       <l n="25">Where no thing rests and no man is ,</l>
       <l n="26">And only fire and night hold sway ;</l>
       <l n="27">The beat , the thunder and the hiss</l>
       <l n="28">Cease not , and change not , night nor day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="29">And moving at unheard commands ,</l>
       <l n="30">The abysses and vast fires between ,</l>
       <l n="31">Flit figures that with clanking hands</l>
       <l n="32">Obey a hideous routine ;</l>
       <l n="33">They are not flesh , they are not bone ,</l>
       <l n="34">They see not with the human eye ,</l>
       <l n="35">And from their iron lips is blown</l>
       <l n="36">A dreadful and monotonous cry ;</l>
       <l n="37">And whoso of our mortal race</l>
       <l n="38">Should find that city unaware ,</l>
       <l n="39">Lean Death would smite him face to face ,</l>
       <l n="40">And blanch him with its venomed air :</l>
       <l n="41">Or caught by the terrific spell ,</l>
       <l n="42">Each thread of memory snapt and cut ,</l>
       <l n="43">His soul would shrivel and its shell</l>
       <l n="44">Go rattling like an empty nut .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="45">It was not always so , but once ,</l>
       <l n="46">In days that no man thinks upon ,</l>
       <l n="47">Fair voices echoed from its stones ,</l>
       <l n="48">The light above it leaped and shone :</l>
       <l n="49">Once there were multitudes of men ,</l>
       <l n="50">That built that city in their pride ,</l>
       <l n="51">Until its might was made , and then</l>
       <l n="52">They withered age by age and died .</l>
       <l n="53">But now of that prodigious race ,</l>
       <l n="54">Three only in an iron tower ,</l>
       <l n="55">Set like carved idols face to face ,</l>
       <l n="56">Remain the masters of its power ;</l>
       <l n="57">And at the city gate a fourth ,</l>
       <l n="58">Gigantic and with dreadful eyes ,</l>
       <l n="59">Sits looking toward the lightless north ,</l>
       <l n="60">Beyond the reach of memories ;</l>
       <l n="61">Fast rooted to the lurid floor ,</l>
       <l n="62">A bulk that never moves a jot ,</l>
       <l n="63">In his pale body dwells no more ,</l>
       <l n="64">Or mind , or soul ,— an idiot !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="65">But sometime in the end those three</l>
       <l n="66">Shall perish and their hands be still ,</l>
       <l n="67">And with the master 's touch shall flee</l>
       <l n="68">Their incommunicable skill .</l>
       <l n="69">A stillness absolute as death</l>
       <l n="70">Along the slacking wheels shall lie ,</l>
       <l n="71">And , flagging at a single breath ,</l>
       <l n="72">The fires shall moulder out and die .</l>
       <l n="73">The roar shall vanish at its height ,</l>
       <l n="74">And over that tremendous town</l>
       <l n="75">The silence of eternal night</l>
       <l n="76">Shall gather close and settle down .</l>
       <l n="77">All its grim grandeur , tower and hall ,</l>
       <l n="78">Shall be abandoned utterly ,</l>
       <l n="79">And into rust and dust shall fall</l>
       <l n="80">From century to century ;</l>

       <l n="84">Nor sound of any foot shall pass :</l>
       <l n="85">Alone of its accursèd state ,</l>

       <l n="2">The hopeful , solemn , many-murmured night !</l>
       <l n="3">The earth lies hushed with expectation ; bright</l>
       <l n="4">Above the world 's dark border burns the moon ,</l>
       <l n="5">Yellow and large ; from forest floorways , strewn</l>
       <l n="6">With flowers , and fields that tingle with new birth ,</l>
       <l n="7">The moist smell of the unimprisoned earth</l>
       <l n="8">Comes up , a sigh , a haunting promise . Soon ,</l>
       <l n="9">Ah , soon , the teeming triumph ! At my feet</l>
       <l n="10">The river with its stately sweep and wheel</l>
       <l n="11">Moves on slow-motioned , luminous , grey like steel .</l>
       <l n="12">From fields far off whose watery hollows gleam ,</l>
       <l n="13">Aye with blown throats that make the long hours sweet ,</l>
       <l n="14">The sleepless toads are murmuring in their dream .</l>

       <l n="1">Scarcely a breath about the rocky stair</l>

       <l n="3">Heaving salt fragrance on the midnight air ,</l>
       <l n="4">Climbed with a murmurous and fitful surge .</l>
       <l n="5">A hoary mist rose up and slowly sheathed</l>
       <l n="6">The dripping walls and portal granite-stepped ,</l>
       <l n="7">And sank into the inner court , and crept</l>
       <l n="8">From column unto column thickly wreathed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">In that dead hour of darkness before dawn ,</l>
       <l n="10">When hearts beat fainter , and the hands of death</l>

       <l n="12">And feverish lids and scarcely moving breath ,</l>
       <l n="13">The hapless mother , tender Chione ,</l>
       <l n="14">Beside the earth-cold figure of her child ,</l>
       <l n="15">After long bursts of weeping sharp and wild</l>
       <l n="16">Lay broken , silent in her agony .</l>
       <l n="17">At first in waking horror racked and bound</l>
       <l n="18">She lay , and then a gradual stupor grew</l>
       <l n="19">About her soul and wrapped her round and round</l>
       <l n="20">Like death , and then she sprang to life anew</l>
       <l n="21">Out of a darkness clammy as the tomb ;</l>
       <l n="22">And , touched by memory or some spirit hand ,</l>
       <l n="23">She seemed to keep a pathway down a land</l>
       <l n="24">Of monstrous shadow and Cimmerian gloom .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="25">A waste of cloudy and perpetual night —</l>

       <l n="28">Unseen , but multitudinous . Aware</l>
       <l n="29">Of something also on her path she was</l>
       <l n="30">That drew her heart forth with a tender cry .</l>
       <l n="31">She hurried with drooped ear and eager eye ,</l>
       <l n="32">And called on the foul shapes to let her pass .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="33">For down the sloping darkness far ahead</l>
       <l n="34">She saw a little figure slight and small ,</l>
       <l n="35">With yearning arms and shadowy curls outspread ,</l>
       <l n="36">Running at frightened speed ; and it would fall</l>
       <l n="37">And rise , sobbing ; and through the ghostly sleet</l>
       <l n="38">The cry came : ‘ Mother ! Mother ! ’ and she wist</l>
       <l n="39">The tender eyes were blinded by the mist ,</l>
       <l n="40">And the rough stones were bruising the small feet .</l>
       <l n="41">And when she lifted a keen cry and clave</l>
       <l n="42">Forthright the gathering horror of the place ,</l>
       <l n="43">Mad with her love and pity , a dark wave</l>
       <l n="44">Of clapping shadows swept about her face ,</l>
       <l n="45">And beat her back , and when she gained her breath ,</l>
       <l n="46">Athwart an awful vale a grizzled steam</l>
       <l n="47">Was rising from a mute and murky stream ,</l>
       <l n="48">As cold and cavernous as the eye of death .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="49">And near the ripple stood the little shade ,</l>
       <l n="50">And many hovering ghosts drew near him , some</l>
       <l n="51">That seemed to peer out of the mist and fade</l>
       <l n="52">With eyes of soft and shadowing pity , dumb ;</l>
       <l n="53">But others closed him round with eager sighs</l>
       <l n="54">And sweet insistence , striving to caress</l>
       <l n="55">And comfort him ; but grieving none the less ,</l>
       <l n="56">He reached her heartstrings with his tender cries .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="57">And silently across the horrid flow ,</l>
       <l n="58">The shapeless bark and pallid chalklike arms</l>
       <l n="59">Of him that oared it , dumbly to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="60">Went gliding , and the struggling ghosts in swarms</l>
       <l n="61">Leaped in and passed , but myriads more behind</l>
       <l n="62">Crowded the dismal beaches . One might hear</l>
       <l n="63">A tumult of entreaty thin and clear</l>
       <l n="64">Rise like the whistle of a winter wind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="65">And still the little figure stood beside</l>
       <l n="66">The hideous stream , and toward the whispering prow</l>
       <l n="67">Held forth his tender tremulous hands , and cried ,</l>
       <l n="68">Now to the awful ferryman , and now</l>
       <l n="69">To her that battled with the shades in vain .</l>
       <l n="70">Sometimes impending over all her sight</l>
       <l n="71">The spongy dark and the phantasmal flight</l>
       <l n="72">Of things half-shapen passed and hid the plain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="73">And sometimes in a gust a sort of wind</l>
       <l n="74">Drove by , and where its power was hurled ,</l>
       <l n="75">She saw across the twilight , jarred and thinned ,</l>
       <l n="76">Those gloomy meadows of the under world ,</l>
       <l n="77">Where never sunlight was , nor grass , nor trees ,</l>
       <l n="78">And the dim pathways from the Stygian shore ,</l>
       <l n="79">Sombre and swart and barren , wandered o'er</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="81">And farther still upon the utmost rim</l>

       <l n="83">She saw in piling outline , huge and dim ,</l>
       <l n="84">The walled and towerèd dwellings of the dead</l>
       <l n="85">And the grim house of Hades . Then she broke</l>
       <l n="86">Once more fierce-footed through the noisome press ;</l>
       <l n="87">But ere she reached the goal of her distress ,</l>
       <l n="88">Her pierced heart seemed to shatter , and she woke .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="89">It seemed as she had been entombed for years ,</l>

       <l n="91">There was an awful echoing in her ears</l>
       <l n="92">And a great deadness pressing at her heart .</l>
       <l n="93">She shuddered and with terror seemed to freeze ,</l>
       <l n="94">Lip-shrunken and wide-eyed a moment 's space ,</l>
       <l n="95">And then she touched the little lifeless face ,</l>
       <l n="96">And kissed it , and rose up upon her knees .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="97">And round her still the silence seemed to teem</l>

       <l n="99">No dream , she thought ; it could not be a dream ,</l>
       <l n="100">But her child called for her ; her child , her child !—</l>
       <l n="101">She clasped her quivering fingers white and spare ,</l>
       <l n="102">And knelt low down , and bending her fair head</l>
       <l n="103">Unto the lower gods who rule the dead ,</l>
       <l n="104">Touched them with tender homage and this prayer :</l>

       <l n="1">Now being on the eve of death , discharged</l>
       <l n="2">From every mortal hope and earthly care ,</l>

       <l n="17">And murderers and divers evil men ;</l>
       <l n="18">So foul a pressure , we had almost died ,</l>
       <l n="19">Even there , in struggle for the breath of life</l>
       <l n="20">Amid the stench and unendurable heat ;</l>
       <l n="21">Nor could we find each other save by voice</l>
       <l n="22">Or touch , to know that we were yet alive ,</l>
       <l n="23">So terrible was the darkness . Yea , ‘ twas hard</l>
       <l n="24">To keep the sacred courage in our hearts ,</l>
       <l n="25">When all was blind with that unchanging night ,</l>
       <l n="26">And foul with death , and on our ears the taunts</l>

       <l n="28">Fell mingled with the prisoners ’ cries , a load</l>
       <l n="29">Sharper to bear , more bitter than their blows .</l>
       <l n="30">At first , what with that dread of our abode ,</l>
       <l n="31">Our sudden apprehension , and the threats</l>
       <l n="32">Ringing perpetually in our ears , we lost</l>
       <l n="33">The living fire of faith , and like poor hinds</l>

       <l n="37">The stay and comfort of our weaker ones ,</l>
       <l n="38">Was silent for long whiles . Perchance she shrank</l>
       <l n="39">In the mere sickness of the flesh , confused</l>
       <l n="40">And shaken by our new and horrible plight —</l>
       <l n="41">The tender flesh , untempered and untried ,</l>
       <l n="42">Not quickened yet nor mastered by the soul ;</l>
       <l n="43">For she was of a fair and delicate make ,</l>
       <l n="44">Most gently nurtured , to whom stripes and threats</l>
       <l n="45">And our foul prison-house were things undreamed .</l>
       <l n="46">But little by little as our spirits grew</l>
       <l n="47">Inured to suffering , with clasped hands , and tongues</l>
       <l n="48">That cheered each other to incessant prayer ,</l>
       <l n="49">We rose and faced our trouble : we recalled</l>
       <l n="50">Our Master 's sacred agony and death ,</l>

       <l n="71">Relieved the horror of our prison gloom ,</l>
       <l n="72">They brought it to her , and she sat apart ,</l>

       <l n="134">Aiming the potent weapon of Christ 's name —</l>

       <l n="189">At moments from masked lips and furtive eyes</l>
       <l n="190">Of friends — some known to as and some unknown —</l>
       <l n="191">Many veiled messages of love and praise .</l>
       <l n="192">The floorways of the long basilica</l>
       <l n="193">Fronted us with an angry multitude ;</l>
       <l n="194">And scornful eyes and threatening foreheads frowned</l>
       <l n="195">In hundreds from the columned galleries .</l>
       <l n="196">We were placed all together at the bar ,</l>
       <l n="197">And though at first unsteadied and confused</l>
       <l n="198">By the imperial presence of the law ,</l>
       <l n="199">The pomp of judgment and the staring crowd ,</l>
       <l n="200">None failed or faltered ; with unshaken tongue</l>
       <l n="201">Each met the stern Proconsul 's brief demand</l>
       <l n="202">In clear profession . Rapt as in a dream ,</l>
       <l n="203">Scarce conscious of my turn , nor how I spake ,</l>
       <l n="204">I watched with wondering eyes the delicate face</l>
       <l n="205">And figure of Perpetua ; for her</l>
       <l n="206">We that were youngest of our company</l>
       <l n="207">Loved with a sacred and absorbing love ,</l>
       <l n="208">A passion that our martyr 's brotherly vow</l>
       <l n="209">Had purified and made divine . She stood</l>
       <l n="210">In dreamy contemplation , slightly bowed ,</l>
       <l n="211">A glowing stillness that was near a smile</l>
       <l n="212">Upon her soft closed lips . Her turn had come ,</l>
       <l n="213">When , like a puppet struggling up the steps ,</l>
       <l n="214">Her father from the pierced and swaying crowd</l>
       <l n="215">Appeared , unveiling in his agèd arms</l>
       <l n="216">The smiling visage of her babe . He grasped</l>
       <l n="217">Her robe , and strove to draw her down . All eyes</l>
       <l n="218">Were bent upon her . With a softening glance ,</l>
       <l n="219">And voice less cold and heavy with death 's doom ,</l>
       <l n="220">The old Proconsul turned to her and said :</l>
       <l n="221">‘ Lady , have pity on your father 's age ;</l>
       <l n="222">Be mindful of your tender babe ; this grain</l>
       <l n="223">Of harmless incense offer for the peace</l>
       <l n="224">And welfare of the Emperor ’ ; but she ,</l>
       <l n="225">Lifting far forth her large and noteless eyes ,</l>
       <l n="226">As one that saw a vision , only said :</l>
       <l n="227">‘ I cannot sacrifice ’ ; and he , harsh tongued ,</l>
       <l n="228">Bending a brow upon her rough as rock ,</l>
       <l n="229">With eyes that struck like steel , seeking to break</l>
       <l n="230">Or snare her with a sudden stroke of fear :</l>
       <l n="231">‘ Art thou a Christian ? ’ and she answered , ‘ Yea ,</l>
       <l n="232">I am a Christian ! ’ In brow-blackening wrath</l>
       <l n="233">He motioned a contemptuous hand and bade</l>
       <l n="234">The lictors scourge the old man down and forth</l>
       <l n="235">With rods , and as the cruel deed was done ,</l>
       <l n="236">Perpetua stood white with quivering lips ,</l>
       <l n="237">And her eyes filled with tears . While yet his cries</l>
       <l n="238">Were mingling with the curses of the crowd ,</l>
       <l n="239">Hilarianus , calling name by name ,</l>
       <l n="240">Gave sentence , and in cold and formal phrase</l>
       <l n="241">Condemned us to the beasts , and we returned</l>
       <l n="242">Rejoicing to our prison . Then we wished</l>
       <l n="243">Our martyrdom could soon have followed , not</l>
       <l n="244">As doubting for our constancy , but some</l>
       <l n="245">Grew sick under the anxious long suspense .</l>
       <l n="246">Perpetua again was weighed upon</l>
       <l n="247">By grief and trouble for her babe , whom now</l>
       <l n="248">Her father , seeking to depress her will ,</l>
       <l n="249">Withheld and would not send it ; but at length</l>
       <l n="250">Word being brought her that the child indeed</l>
       <l n="251">No longer suffered , nor desired the breast ,</l>
       <l n="252">Her peace returned , and , giving thanks to God ,</l>
       <l n="253">All were united in new bonds of hope .</l>
       <l n="254">Now being fixed in certitude of death ,</l>
       <l n="255">We stripped our souls of all their earthly gear ,</l>
       <l n="256">The useless raiment of this world ; and thus ,</l>
       <l n="257">Striving together with a single will ,</l>
       <l n="258">In daily increment of faith and power ,</l>
       <l n="259">We were much comforted by heavenly dreams ,</l>
       <l n="260">And waking visitations of God 's grace .</l>
       <l n="261">Visions of light and glory infinite</l>
       <l n="262">Were frequent with us , and by night or day</l>
       <l n="263">Woke at the very name of Christ the Lord ,</l>
       <l n="264">Taken at any moment on our lips ;</l>
       <l n="265">So that we had no longer thought or care</l>
       <l n="266">Of life or of the living , but became</l>
       <l n="267">As spirits from this earth already freed ,</l>
       <l n="268">Scarce conscious of the dwindling weight of flesh .</l>
       <l n="269">To Saturus appeared in dreams the space</l>
       <l n="270">And splendour of the heavenly house of God ,</l>
       <l n="271">The glowing gardens of eternal joy ,</l>
       <l n="272">The halls and chambers of the cherubim ,</l>
       <l n="273">In wreaths of endless myriads involved</l>
       <l n="274">The blinding glory of the angel choir ,</l>
       <l n="275">Rolling through deeps of wheeling cloud and light</l>
       <l n="276">The thunder of their vast antiphonies .</l>
       <l n="277">The visions of Perpetua not less</l>
       <l n="278">Possessed us with their homely tenderness —</l>
       <l n="279">As one , wherein she saw a rock-set pool</l>
       <l n="280">And weeping o'er its rim a little child ,</l>
       <l n="281">Her brother , long since dead , Dinocrates :</l>
       <l n="282">Though sore athirst , he could not reach the stream ,</l>
       <l n="283">Being so small , and her heart grieved thereat .</l>
       <l n="284">She looked again , and lo ! the pool had risen ,</l>
       <l n="285">And the child filled his goblet , and drank deep ,</l>
       <l n="286">And prattling in a tender childish joy</l>
       <l n="287">Ran gaily off , as infants do , to play .</l>
       <l n="288">By this she knew his soul had found release</l>
       <l n="289">From torment , and had entered into bliss .</l>

       <l n="307">In harsher durance , fearing our escape</l>
       <l n="308">By fraud or witchcraft ; but Perpetua ,</l>
       <l n="309">Facing him gently with a noble note</l>
       <l n="310">Of wonder in her voice , and on her lips</l>
       <l n="311">A lingering smile of mournful irony :</l>

       <l n="314">Should ye not rather tend us with soft care ,</l>

       <l n="355">In nets , naked before the multitude ,</l>
       <l n="356">For a fierce bull , maddened by goads , to toss .</l>

       <l n="362">Their tender limbs so eloquent of shame ;</l>
       <l n="363">And so our loved ones were brought back , all faint ,</l>
       <l n="364">And covered with light raiment , and again</l>
       <l n="365">Led forth , and now with smiling lips they passed</l>
       <l n="366">Pale , but unbowed , into the awful ring ,</l>

       <l n="370">She strove to hide herself as best she could</l>
       <l n="371">In the torn remnants of her flimsy robe ,</l>
       <l n="372">And putting up her hands clasped back her hair ,</l>
       <l n="373">So that she might not die as one in grief ,</l>
       <l n="374">Unseemly and dishevelled . Then she turned ,</l>
       <l n="375">And in her loving arms caressed and raised</l>
       <l n="376">The dying , bruised Felicitas . Once more</l>
       <l n="377">Gored by the cruel beast , they both were borne</l>
       <l n="378">Swooning and mortally stricken from the field .</l>
       <l n="379">Perpetua , pale and beautiful , her lips</l>
       <l n="380">Parted as in a lingering ecstasy ,</l>
       <l n="381">Could not believe the end had come , but asked</l>
       <l n="382">When they were to be given to the beasts .</l>
       <l n="383">The keepers gathered round her — even they —</l>
       <l n="384">In wondering pity — while with fearless hand ,</l>
       <l n="385">Bidding us all be faithful and stand firm ,</l>
       <l n="386">She bared her breast , and guided to its goal</l>

      <head>THE WOODCUTTER 'S HUT</head>
       <l n="1">Far up in the wild and wintery hills in the heart of the cliff-broken</l>
       <l n="2">woods ,</l>
       <l n="3">Where the mounded drifts lie soft and deep in the noiseless solitudes ,</l>
       <l n="4">The hut of the lonely woodcutter stands , a few rough beams that show</l>
       <l n="5">A blunted peak and a low black line , from the glittering waste of snow .</l>
       <l n="6">In the frost-still dawn from his roof goes up in the windless ,</l>
       <l n="7">motionless air ,</l>
       <l n="8">The thin , pink curl of leisurely smoke ; through the forest white and</l>
       <l n="9">bare</l>
       <l n="10">The woodcutter follows his narrow trail , and the morning rings and</l>
       <l n="11">cracks</l>
       <l n="12">With the rhythmic jet of his sharp-blown breath and the echoing shout of</l>
       <l n="13">his axe .</l>
       <l n="14">Only the waft of the wind besides , or the stir of some hardy bird —</l>
       <l n="15">The call of the friendly chickadee , or the pat of the nuthatch — is</l>
       <l n="16">heard ;</l>
       <l n="17">Or a rustle comes from a dusky clump , where the busy siskins feed ,</l>
       <l n="18">And scatter the dimpled sheet of the snow with the shells of the</l>
       <l n="19">cedar-seed .</l>
       <l n="20">Day after day the woodcutter toils untiring with axe and wedge ,</l>
       <l n="21">Till the jingling teams come up from the road that runs by the valley 's</l>
       <l n="22">edge ,</l>
       <l n="23">With plunging of horses , and hurling of snow , and many a shouted word ,</l>
       <l n="24">And carry away the keen-scented fruit of his cutting , cord upon cord .</l>
       <l n="25">Not the sound of a living foot comes else , not a moving visitant there ,</l>
       <l n="26">Save the delicate step of some halting doe , or the sniff of a prowling</l>
       <l n="27">bear .</l>
       <l n="28">And only the stars are above him at night , and the trees that creak and</l>
       <l n="29">groan ,</l>
       <l n="30">And the frozen , hard-swept mountain-crests with their silent fronts of</l>
       <l n="31">stone ,</l>
       <l n="32">As he watches the sinking glow of his fire and the wavering flames</l>
       <l n="33">upcaught ,</l>
       <l n="34">Cleaning his rifle or mending his moccasins , sleepy and slow of</l>
       <l n="35">thought .</l>
       <l n="36">Or when the fierce snow comes , with the rising wind , from the grey</l>
       <l n="37">north-east ,</l>
       <l n="38">He lies through the leaguering hours in his bunk like a winter-hidden</l>
       <l n="39">beast ,</l>
       <l n="40">Or sits on the hard-packed earth , and smokes by his draught-blown</l>
       <l n="41">guttering fire ,</l>
       <l n="42">Without thought or remembrance , hardly awake , and waits for the storm</l>
       <l n="43">to tire .</l>
       <l n="44">Scarcely he hears from the rock-rimmed heights to the wild ravines</l>
       <l n="45">below ,</l>
       <l n="46">Near and far-off , the limitless wings of the tempest hurl and go</l>
       <l n="47">In roaring gusts that plunge through the cracking forest , and lull ,</l>
       <l n="48">and lift ,</l>
       <l n="49">All day without stint and all night long with the sweep of the hissing</l>
       <l n="50">drift .</l>
       <l n="51">But winter shall pass ere long with its hills of snow and its fettered</l>
       <l n="52">dreams ,</l>
       <l n="53">And the forest shall glimmer with living gold , and chime with the</l>
       <l n="54">gushing of streams ;</l>
       <l n="55">Millions of little points of plants shall prick through its matted</l>
       <l n="56">floor ,</l>
       <l n="57">And the wind-flower lift and uncurl her silken buds by the woodman 's</l>
       <l n="58">door ;</l>
       <l n="59">The sparrow shall see and exult ; but lo ! as the spring draws gaily on ,</l>
       <l n="60">The woodcutter 's hut is empty and bare , and the master that made it is</l>
       <l n="61">gone .</l>
       <l n="62">He is gone where the gathering of valley men another labour yields ,</l>
       <l n="63">To handle the plough , and the harrow , and scythe , in the heat of the</l>
       <l n="64">summer fields .</l>
       <l n="65">He is gone with his corded arms , and his ruddy face , and his moccasined</l>
       <l n="66">feet ,</l>
       <l n="67">The animal man in his warmth and vigour , sound , and hard , and complete .</l>
       <l n="68">And all summer long , round the lonely hut , the black earth burgeons and</l>
       <l n="69">breeds ,</l>
       <l n="70">Till the spaces are filled with the tall-plumed ferns and the triumphing</l>
       <l n="71">forest-weeds ;</l>
       <l n="72">The thick wild raspberries hem its walls , and , stretching on either</l>
       <l n="73">hand ,</l>
       <l n="74">The red-ribbed stems and the giant-leaves of the sovereign spikenard</l>
       <l n="75">stand .</l>
       <l n="76">So lonely and silent it is , so withered and warped with the sun and</l>
       <l n="77">snow ,</l>
       <l n="78">You would think it the fruit of some dead man 's toil a hundred years</l>
       <l n="79">ago ;</l>
       <l n="80">And he who finds it suddenly there , as he wanders far and alone ,</l>
       <l n="81">Is touched with a sweet and beautiful sense of something tender and</l>
       <l n="82">gone ,</l>
       <l n="83">The sense of a struggling life in the waste , and the mark of a soul 's</l>
       <l n="84">command ,</l>
       <l n="85">The going and coming of vanished feet , the touch of a human hand .</l>

      <head>WINTER-BREAK</head>
       <l n="1">All day between high-curded clouds the sun</l>
       <l n="2">Shone down like summer on the steaming planks .</l>
       <l n="3">The long , bright icicles in dwindling ranks</l>

       <l n="7">Loosened and shunted with a sudden roar</l>
       <l n="8">From downward roofs . Not even with day done</l>
       <l n="9">Had ceased the sound of waters , but all night</l>
       <l n="10">I heard it . In my dreams forgetfully bright</l>
       <l n="11">Methought I wandered in the April woods ,</l>
       <l n="12">Where many a silver-piping sparrow was ,</l>
       <l n="13">By gurgling brooks and spouting solitudes ,</l>
