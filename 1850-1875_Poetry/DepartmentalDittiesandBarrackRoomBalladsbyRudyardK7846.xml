Was there aught that I did not share In vigil or toil or ease , One joy or woe that I did not know , Dear hearts across the seas ?

       <l n="18">Won a simple Viceroy 's praise</l>

       <l n="23">Who shall doubt the secret hid</l>

       <l n="25">Was that the contractor did</l>

       <l n="5">Ahasuerus Jenkins of the “ Operatic Own ”</l>
       <l n="6">Was dowered with a tenor voice of super-Santley tone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="7">His views on equitation were , perhaps , a trifle queer ;</l>
       <l n="8">He had no seat worth mentioning , but oh ! he had an ear .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="9">He clubbed his wretched company a dozen times a day ,</l>
       <l n="10">He used to quit his charger in a parabolic way ,</l>
       <l n="11">His method of saluting was the joy of all beholders ,</l>
       <l n="12">But Ahasuerus Jenkins had a head upon his shoulders .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="13">He took two months to Simla when the year was at the spring ,</l>
       <l n="14">And underneath the deodars eternally did sing .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="15">He warbled like a bulbul , but particularly at</l>
       <l n="16">Cornelia Agrippina who was musical and fat .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="17">She controlled a humble husband , who , in turn , controlled a Dept .,</l>
       <l n="18">Where Cornelia Agrippina 's human singing-birds were kept</l>
       <l n="19">From April to October on a plump retaining fee ,</l>
       <l n="20">Supplied , of course , per mensem , by the Indian Treasury .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="21">Cornelia used to sing with him , and Jenkins used to play ;</l>
       <l n="22">He praised unblushingly her notes , for he was false as they :</l>
       <l n="23">So when the winds of April turned the budding roses brown ,</l>
       <l n="24">Cornelia told her husband : “ Tom , you must n't send him down . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="25">They haled him from his regiment which did n't much regret him ;</l>
       <l n="26">They found for him an office-stool , and on that stool they set him ,</l>
       <l n="27">To play with maps and catalogues three idle hours a day ,</l>
       <l n="28">And draw his plump retaining fee — which means his double pay .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="29">Now , ever after dinner , when the coffeecups are brought ,</l>
       <l n="30">Ahasuerus waileth o'er the grand pianoforte ;</l>
       <l n="31">And , thanks to fair Cornelia , his fame hath waxen great ,</l>
       <l n="32">And Ahasuerus Jenkins is a power in the State .</l>

       <l n="1">This is the reason why Rustum Beg ,</l>

       <l n="3">Drinketh the “ simpkin ” and brandy peg ,</l>
       <l n="4">Maketh the money to fly ,</l>

       <l n="7">RUSTUM BEG of Kolazai — slightly backward native state</l>
       <l n="8">Lusted for a C. S. I .,— so began to sanitate .</l>
       <l n="9">Built a Jail and Hospital — nearly built a City drain —</l>
       <l n="10">Till his faithful subjects all thought their Ruler was insane .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Strange departures made he then — yea , Departments stranger still ,</l>
       <l n="12">Half a dozen Englishmen helped the Rajah with a will ,</l>
       <l n="13">Talked of noble aims and high , hinted of a future fine</l>
       <l n="14">For the state of Kolazai , on a strictly Western line .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="15">Rajah Rustum held his peace ; lowered octroi dues a half ;</l>
       <l n="16">Organized a State Police ; purified the Civil Staff ;</l>
       <l n="17">Settled cess and tax afresh in a very liberal way ;</l>
       <l n="18">Cut temptations of the flesh — also cut the Bukhshi 's pay ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="19">Roused his Secretariat to a fine Mahratta fury ,</l>
       <l n="20">By a Hookum hinting at supervision of dasturi ;</l>
       <l n="21">Turned the State of Kolazai very nearly upside-down ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="28">How he disendowed the Jail — stopped at once the City drain ;</l>

       <l n="30">Doubled taxes , cesses , all ; cleared away each new-built thana ;</l>

       <l n="32">Heaped upon the Bukhshi Sahib wealth and honors manifold ;</l>

     <p>CERTAIN MAXIMS OF HAFIZ</p>
     <p>I . If It be pleasant to look on , stalled in the packed serai , Does not the Young Man try Its temper and pace ere he buy ? If She be pleasant to look on , what does the Young Man say ? “ Lo ! She is pleasant to look on , give Her to me today ! ”</p>
     <p>II . Yea , though a Kafir die , to him is remitted Jehannum If he borrowed in life from a native at sixty per cent . per annum .</p>
     <p>III . Blister we not for bursati ? So when the heart is vexed , The pain of one maiden 's refusal is drowned in the pain of the next .</p>
     <p>IV . The temper of chums , the love of your wife , and a new piano 's tune — Which of the three will you trust at the end of an Indian June ?</p>
     <p>V. Who are the rulers of Ind — to whom shall we bow the knee ? Make your peace with the women , and men will make you L. G .</p>
     <p>VI . Does the woodpecker flit round the young ferash ? Does grass clothe a new-built wall ? Is she under thirty , the woman who holds a boy in her thrall ?</p>
     <p>VII . If She grow suddenly gracious — reflect . Is it all for thee ? The black-buck is stalked through the bullock , and Man through jealousy .</p>
     <p>VIII . Seek not for favor of women . So shall you find it indeed . Does not the boar break cover just when you 're lighting a weed ?</p>
     <p>IX . If He play , being young and unskilful , for shekels of silver and gold , Take his money , my son , praising Allah . The kid was ordained to be sold .</p>
     <p>X . With a “ weed ” among men or horses verily this is the best , That you work him in office or dog-cart lightly — but give him no rest .</p>
     <p>XI . Pleasant the snaffle of Courtship , improving the manners and carriage ; But the colt who is wise will abstain from the terrible thorn-bit of Marriage .</p>
     <p>XII . As the thriftless gold of the babul , so is the gold that we spend On a derby Sweep , or our neighbor 's wife , or the horse that we buy from a friend .</p>
     <p>XIII . The ways of man with a maid be strange , yet simple and tame To the ways of a man with a horse , when selling or racing that same .</p>
     <p>XIV . In public Her face turneth to thee , and pleasant Her smile when ye meet . It is ill . The cold rocks of El-Gidar smile thus on the waves at their feet .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">In public Her face is averted , with anger . She nameth thy name .</l>
       <l n="2">It is well . Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>XV . If She have spoken a word , remember thy lips are sealed , And the Brand of the Dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">If She have written a letter , delay not an instant , but burn it .</l>
       <l n="2">Tear it to pieces , O Fool , and the wind to her mate shall return it !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">If there be trouble to Herward , and a lie of the blackest can clear ,</l>
       <l n="4">Lie , while thy lips can move or a man is alive to hear .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>XVI . My Son , if a maiden deny thee and scufflingly bid thee give o'er , Yet lip meets with lip at the last word — get out ! She has been there before . They are pecked on the ear and the chin and the nose who are lacking in lore .</p>
     <p>XVII . If we fall in the race , though we win , the hoof-slide is scarred on the course . Though Allah and Earth pardon Sin , remaineth forever Remorse .</p>
     <p>XVIII . “ By all I am misunderstood ! ” if the Matron shall say , or the Maid : “ Alas ! I do not understand , ” my son , be thou nowise afraid .</p>
     <p>In vain in the sight of the Bird is the net of the Fowler displayed .</p>
     <p>XIX . My son , if I , Hafiz , the father , take hold of thy knees in my pain , Demanding thy name on stamped paper , one day or one hour — refrain .</p>
     <p>Are the links of thy fetters so light that thou cravest another man 's chain ?</p>

     <p>Abdhur Rahman , the Durani Chief , of him is the story told , He has opened his mouth to the North and the South , they have stuffed his mouth with gold .</p>
     <p>Ye know the truth of his tender ruth — and sweet his favours are : Ye have heard the song — How long ? How long ? from Balkh to Kandahar .</p>

       <l n="5">And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye ,</l>
       <l n="6">And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby ,</l>
       <l n="7">And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall ,</l>
       <l n="8">And he was Captain of the Fleet — the bravest of them all .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the sheer , When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer .</p>

       <l n="30">I had towed him aft of his own craft , a bait for his brother shark ;</l>
       <l n="31">I had lapped him round with cocoa husk , and drenched him with the oil ,</l>
