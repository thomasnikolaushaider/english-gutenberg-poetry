   <p>Not tired of ‘ earin ’ stories ! You 're a nailer , so you are ! I thought I should ‘ ave choked you off with that ‘ ere motor-car . Well , mister , ‘ ere 's another ; and , mind you , it 's a fact , Though you 'll think perhaps I copped it out o ’ some blue ribbon tract .</p>
   <p>It was in the days when farmer men were jolly-faced and stout , For all the cash was comin ’ in and little goin ’ out ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>But now , you see , the farmer men are ‘ ungry-faced and thin , For all the cash is goin ’ out and little comin ’ in .</p>
   <p>But in the days I 'm speakin ’ of , before the drop in wheat , The life them farmers led was such as could n't well be beat ; They went the pace amazin ’ , they ‘ unted and they shot , And this ‘ ere Jeremiah Brown the liveliest of the lot .</p>
   <p>‘ E was a fine young fellar ; the best roun ’ ‘ ere by far , But just a bit full-blooded , as fine young fellars are ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>Which I know they did n't ought to , an ’ it 's very wrong of course , But the colt wot never capers makes a mighty useless ‘ orse .</p>
   <p>The lad was never vicious , but ‘ e made the money go , For ‘ e was ready with ‘ is “ yes , ” and back - ward with ‘ is “ no . ” And so ‘ e turned to drink which is the avenoo to ‘ ell , An ’ ‘ ow ‘ e came to stop ‘ imself is wot ’ I ‘ ave to tell .</p>
   <p>Four days on end ‘ e never knew ‘ ow ‘ e ‘ ad got to bed , Until one mornin ’ fifty clocks was tickin ’ in ‘ is ‘ ead ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>And on the same the doctor came , “ You 're very near D. T ., If you do n't stop yourself , young chap , you 'll pay the price , ” said ‘ e .</p>
   <p>“ It takes the form of visions , as I fear you 'll quickly know ; Perhaps a string o ’ monkeys , all a-sittin ’ in a row , Perhaps it 's frogs or beetles , perhaps it 's rats or mice , There are many sorts of visions and there 's none of ‘ em is nice . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But Brown ‘ e started laughin ': “ No</l>

     <l n="3">“ A take - ‘ em-break - ‘ em gallop is the only</l>

   <p>Well , Jeremiah rode to ‘ ounds , exactly as ‘ e said . But all the time the doctor 's words were ringin ’ in ‘ is ‘ ead &amp; mdash ; “ If you do n't stop yourself , young chap , you 've got to pay the price , There are many sorts of visions , but none of ‘ em is nice . ”</p>

   </lg>
   <p>And then the ‘ untsman ‘ e was beat . ‘ Is ‘ orse ‘ ad tripped and fell . “ By George , ” said Brown , “ I 'll go alone , and follow it to well , The place that it belongs to . ” And as ‘ e made the vow , There broke from right in front of ‘ im the queerest kind of row .</p>
   <p>There lay a copse of ‘ azels on the border of the track , And into this two ‘ ounds ‘ ad run them two was all the pack &amp; mdash ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>And now from these ‘ ere ‘ azels there came a fearsome ‘ owl , With a yappin ’ and a snappin ’ and a wicked snarlin ’ growl .</p>
   <p>Jeremiah 's blood ran cold a frightened man was ‘ e , But he butted through the bushes just to see what ‘ e could see , And there beneath their shadow , blood drippin ’ from his jaws , Was an awful creature standin ’ with a ‘ ound beneath its paws .</p>

   <p>Right and left , and left and right , straight and true and hard , Till the Ebenezer Chapel looked more like a knacker 's yard .</p>
   <p>Platt was standin ’ on his back and lookup at his toes , Solly Jones of Perry Bar was feelin ’ for his nose ,</p>

   <p>Five repentant fightin ’ men , sitting in a row , Listenin ’ to words of grace from Mister Bendigo ,</p>
   <p>Listenin ’ to his reverence all as good as gold , Pretty little baa-lambs , gathered to the fold .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span>So that 's the way that Bendy ran his mission in the slum , And preached the Holy Gospel to the fightin ’ men of Brum ,</p>
   <p>“ The Lord , ” said he , “ has given me His message from on high , And if you interrupt Him , I will know the reason why . ”</p>
   <p>But to think of all your schooling clean wasted , thrown away , Darned if I can make out what you 're learnin ’ all the day ,</p>
   <p>Grubbin ’ up old fairy-tales , fillin ’ up with cram , And did n't know of Bendigo , the pride of Nottingham .</p>

     <l n="836"><span type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span>Three crumbling monuments we found ,</l>
     <l n="837">With Stonehenge monoliths around ,</l>
     <l n="838">But who had built and who had planned</l>
     <l n="839">We tried in vain to understand ,</l>
     <l n="840">As future learned men may search</l>
     <l n="841">The reasons for our village church .</l>
     <l n="842">This was our limit , for next day</l>
     <l n="843">We turned upon , our homeward way ,</l>
     <l n="844">Passing first Culloden 's plain</l>
     <l n="845">Where the tombstones of the slain</l>
     <l n="846">Loom above the purple heather .</l>
     <l n="847">There the clansmen lie together &amp; mdash ;</l>
     <l n="848">Men from many an outland skerry ,</l>
     <l n="849">Men from Athol and Glengarry ,</l>
     <l n="850">Camerons from wild Mamore ,</l>
     <l n="851">MacDonalds from the Irish Shore ,</l>
     <l n="852">Red MacGregors and McLeods</l>
     <l n="853">With their tartans for their shrouds ,</l>
     <l n="854">Menzies , Malcolms from the islands ,</l>
     <l n="855">Frasers from the upper Highlands &amp; mdash ;</l>
     <l n="856">Callous is the passer by</l>
     <l n="857">Who can turn without a sigh</l>
     <l n="858">From the tufts of heather deep</l>
     <l n="859">Where the noble clansmen sleep .</l>
     <l n="860">Now we swiftly made our way</l>
     <l n="861">To Kingussie in Strathspey ,</l>
     <l n="862">Skirting many a nameless loch</l>
     <l n="863">As we flew through Badenoch ,</l>
     <l n="864">Till at Killiecrankie 's Pass ,</l>
     <l n="865">Heather changing into grass</l>
     <l n="866">We descended once again</l>
     <l n="867">To the fertile lowland plain ,</l>
     <l n="868">And by Perth and old Dunblane</l>
     <l n="869">Reached the banks of Allan Water ,</l>
     <l n="870">Famous for the miller 's daughter ,</l>
     <l n="871">Whence at last we circled back</l>
     <l n="872"><span type="note_anchor">[ 137 ]</span>Till we crossed our Stirling track .</l>
     <l n="873">So our little journey ended ,</l>
     <l n="874">Gladness and instruction blended &amp; mdash ;</l>
     <l n="875">Not a care to spoil our pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="876">Not a thought to break our leisure ,</l>
     <l n="877">Drifting on from Sussex hedges</l>
     <l n="878">Up through Yorkshire 's fells and ledges</l>
     <l n="879">Past the deserts and morasses</l>
     <l n="880">Of the dreary Border passes ,</l>
     <l n="881">Through the scenes of Scottish story</l>
     <l n="882">Past the fields of battles gory .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="125">
     <l n="883">In the future it will seem</l>
     <l n="884">To have been a happy dream ,</l>
