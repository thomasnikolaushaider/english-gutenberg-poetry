    <docImprint>The Manager of the Dun Emer Press has to thank Mr. John Lane for permission to reprint ten poems from Homeward Songs by the Way and nine poems from The Earth Breath , also Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co. for permission to reprint seven poems from The Divine Vision . Oh , be not led away , Lured by the colour of the sun-rich day . The gay romance of song Unto the spirit life doth not belong : Though far-between the hours In which the Master of Angelic powers Lightens the dusk within The holy of holies , be it thine to win Rare vistas of white light , Half parted lips through which the Infinite Murmurs her ancient story , Harkening to whom the wandering planets hoary Waken primeval fires , With deeper rapture in celestial choirs Breathe , and with fleeter motion Wheel in their orbits through the surgeless ocean . So hearken thou like these , Intent on her , mounting by slow degrees , Until thy song 's elation Echoes her multitudinous meditation .</docImprint>

     <head>A SUMMER NIGHT</head>
     <lg>
       <l n="2">Her mist of primroses within her breast</l>
       <l n="3">Twilight hath folded up , and o'er the west ,</l>
       <l n="4">Seeking remoter valleys long hath gone ,</l>
       <l n="5">Not yet hath come her sister of the dawn .</l>
       <l n="6">Silence and coolness now the earth enfold :</l>
       <l n="7">Jewels of glittering green , long mists of gold ,</l>
       <l n="8">Hazes of nebulous silver veil the height ,</l>
       <l n="9">And shake in tremors through the shadowy night .</l>
       <l n="10">Heard through the stillness , as in whispered words ,</l>
       <l n="11">The wandering God-guided wings of birds</l>
       <l n="12">Ruffle the dark . The little lives that lie</l>
       <l n="13">Deep hid in grass join in a long-drawn sigh</l>
       <l n="14">More softly still ; and unheard through the blue</l>
       <l n="15">The falling of innumerable dew ,</l>
       <l n="16">Lifts with grey fingers all the leaves that lay</l>
       <l n="17">Burned in the heat of the consuming day .</l>
       <l n="18">The lawns and lakes lie in this night of love ,</l>
       <l n="19">Admitted to the majesty above .</l>
       <l n="20">Earth with the starry company hath part ;</l>
       <l n="21">The waters hold all heaven within their heart ,</l>
       <l n="22">And glimmer o'er with wave-lips everywhere</l>
       <l n="23">Lifted to meet the angel lips of air .</l>
       <l n="24">The many homes of men shine near and far ;</l>
       <l n="25">Peace-laden as the tender evening star ,</l>
       <l n="26">The late home-coming folk anticipate</l>
       <l n="27">Their rest beyond the passing of the gate ,</l>
       <l n="28">And tread with sleep-filled hearts on drowsy feet .</l>
       <l n="29">Oh , far away and wonderful and sweet</l>
       <l n="30">All this , all this . But far too many things</l>
       <l n="31">Obscuring , as a cloud of seraph wings</l>
       <l n="32">Blinding the seeker for the Lord behind ,</l>
       <l n="33">I fall away in weariness of mind ,</l>
       <l n="34">And think how far apart are I and you ,</l>
       <l n="35">Beloved , from those spirit children who</l>
       <l n="36">Felt but one single Being long ago ,</l>
       <l n="37">Whispering in gentleness and leaning low</l>
       <l n="38">Out of its majesty , as child to child .</l>
       <l n="39">I think upon it all with heart grown wild .</l>
       <l n="40">Hearing no voice , howe'er my spirit broods .</l>
       <l n="41">No whisper from the dense infinitudes ,</l>
       <l n="42">This world of myriad things whose distance awes .</l>
       <l n="43">Ah me ; how innocent our childhood was !</l>

       <l n="1">Still as the holy of holies breathes the vast</l>

       <l n="3">Fire on the altar of the hills at last</l>

       <l n="3">Born ere the Mighty One began his dreams ,</l>

       <l n="9">Yet yearning still to reach to those dim heights ,</l>

      <head>DANA</head>
       <l n="1">I am the tender voice calling ‘ Away , ’</l>
       <l n="2">Whispering between the beatings of the heart ,</l>
       <l n="3">And inaccessible in dewy eyes</l>
       <l n="4">I dwell , and all unkissed on lovely lips ,</l>
       <l n="5">Lingering between white breasts inviolate ,</l>
       <l n="6">And fleeting ever from the passionate touch ,</l>
       <l n="7">I shine afar , till men may not divine</l>
       <l n="8">Whether it is the stars or the beloved</l>
       <l n="9">They follow with wrapt spirit . And I weave</l>
       <l n="10">My spells at evening , folding with dim caress ,</l>
       <l n="11">Aerial arms and twilight dropping hair ,</l>
       <l n="12">The lonely wanderer by wood or shore ,</l>
       <l n="13">Till , filled with some deep tenderness , he yields ,</l>
       <l n="14">Feeling in dreams for the dear mother heart</l>
       <l n="15">He knew , ere he forsook the starry way ,</l>
       <l n="16">And clings there , pillowed far above the smoke</l>
       <l n="17">And the dim murmur from the duns of men .</l>
       <l n="18">I can enchant the trees and rocks , and fill</l>
       <l n="19">The dumb brown lips of earth with mystery ,</l>
       <l n="20">Make them reveal or hide the god . I breathe</l>
       <l n="21">A deeper pity than all love , myself</l>
       <l n="22">Mother of all , but without hands to heal :</l>
       <l n="23">Too vast and vague , they know me not . But yet</l>
       <l n="24">I am the heartbreak over fallen things ,</l>
       <l n="25">The sudden gentleness that stays the blow ,</l>
       <l n="26">And I am in the kiss that foemen give</l>
       <l n="27">Pausing in battle , and in the tears that fall</l>
       <l n="28">Over the vanquished foe , and in the highest ;</l>
       <l n="29">Among the Danaan gods , I am the last</l>
       <l n="30">Council of mercy in their hearts where they</l>
       <l n="31">Mete justice from a thousand starry thrones .</l>

      <head>THE WINDS OF ANGUS</head>
       <l n="1">The grey road whereupon we trod became as holy ground :</l>
       <l n="2">The eve was all one voice that breathed its message with no sound :</l>
       <l n="3">And burning multitudes pour through my heart , too bright , too blind ,</l>
       <l n="4">Too swift and hurried in their flight to leave their tale behind .</l>
       <l n="5">Twin gates unto that living world , dark honey-coloured eyes</l>
       <l n="6">The lifting of whose lashes flushed the face with paradise —</l>
       <l n="7">Beloved , there I saw within their ardent rays unfold</l>
       <l n="8">The likeness of enraptured birds that flew from deeps of gold</l>
       <l n="9">To deeps of gold within my breast to rest or there to be</l>
       <l n="10">Transfigured in the light , or find a death to life in me .</l>
       <l n="11">So love , a burning multitude , a seraph wind which blows</l>
       <l n="12">From out the deep of being to the deep of being goes :</l>
       <l n="13">And sun and moon and starry fires and earth and air and sea</l>
       <l n="14">Are creatures from the deep let loose who pause in ecstasy ,</l>
       <l n="15">Or wing their wild and heavenly way until again they find</l>

      <head>THE DAWN OF DARKNESS</head>
       <l n="1">Come earth 's little children pit-pat from their burrows on the hill ;</l>
       <l n="2">Hangs within the gloom its weary head the shining daffodil .</l>
       <l n="3">In the valley underneath us through the fragrance flit along</l>
       <l n="4">Over fields and over hedgerows little quivering drops of song .</l>
       <l n="5">All adown the pale blue mantle of the mountains far away</l>
       <l n="6">Stream the tresses of the twilight flying in the wake of day .</l>
       <l n="7">Night comes ; soon alone shall fancy follow sadly in her flight</l>
       <l n="8">Where the fiery dust of evening , shaken from the feet of light ,</l>
       <l n="9">Thrusts its monstrous barriers between the pure , the good , the true ,</l>
       <l n="10">That our weeping eyes may strain for , but shall never after view .</l>
       <l n="11">Only yester eve I watched with heart at rest the nebulæ</l>
       <l n="12">Looming far within the shadowy shining of the Milky Way ;</l>
       <l n="13">Finding in the stillness joy and hope for all the sons of men ;</l>
       <l n="14">Now what silent anguish fills a night more beautiful than then .</l>
       <l n="15">For earth 's age of pain has come , and all her sister planets weep ,</l>
       <l n="16">Thinking of her fires of morning passing into dreamless sleep .</l>
       <l n="17">In this cycle of great sorrow for the moments that we last</l>
       <l n="18">We too shall be linked by weeping to the greatness of her past :</l>
       <l n="19">But the coming race shall know not , and the fount of tears shall dry ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the arid heart of man be arid as the desert sky .</l>
       <l n="21">So within my mind the darkness dawned and round me everywhere</l>
       <l n="22">Hope departed with the twilight , leaving only dumb despair .</l>

      <head>THE HEROES</head>
       <l n="1">By many a dream of God and man my thoughts in shining flocks were led :</l>
       <l n="2">But as I went through Patrick Street the hopes and prophecies were dead .</l>
       <l n="3">The hopes and prophecies were dead : they could not blossom where the feet</l>
       <l n="4">Walked amid rottenness , or where the brawling shouters stamped the street .</l>
       <l n="5">Where was the beauty that the Lord gave man when first he towered in pride ?</l>
       <l n="6">But one came by me at whose word the bitter condemnation died .</l>
       <l n="7">His brows were crowned with thorns of light : his eyes were bright as one</l>
       <l n="8">who sees</l>
       <l n="9">The starry palaces shine o'er the sparkle of the heavenly seas .</l>
       <l n="10">‘ Is it not beautiful ? ’ he cried . Our Faery Land of Hearts ’ Desire</l>
       <l n="11">Is mingled through the mire and mist , yet stainless keeps its lovely fire .</l>
       <l n="12">The pearly phantoms with blown hair are dancing where the drunkards reel :</l>
       <l n="13">The cloud frail daffodils shine out where filth is splashing from the heel .</l>
       <l n="14">O sweet , and sweet , and sweet to hear , the melodies in rivers run :</l>
       <l n="15">The rapture of their crowded notes is yet the myriad voice of One .</l>
       <l n="16">Those who are lost and fallen here , to-night in sleep shall pass the gate ,</l>
       <l n="17">And wear the purples of the King , and know them masters of their fate .</l>
       <l n="18">Each wrinkled hag shall reassume the plumes and hues of paradise :</l>
       <l n="19">Each brawler be enthroned in calm among the Children of the Wise .</l>
       <l n="20">Yet in the council with the gods no one will falter to pursue</l>
       <l n="21">His lofty purpose , but come forth the cyclic labours to renew ;</l>
       <l n="22">And take the burden of the world and dim his beauty in a shroud ,</l>
       <l n="23">And wrestle with the chaos till the anarch to the light be bowed .</l>
       <l n="24">We cannot for forgetfulness forego the reverence due to them</l>
       <l n="25">Who wear at times they do not guess the sceptre and the diadem .</l>
       <l n="26">As bright a crown as this was theirs when first they from the Father sped ;</l>
       <l n="27">Yet look with deeper eyes and still the ancient beauty is not dead .</l>
       <l n="28">He mingled with the multitude . I saw their brows were crowned and bright ,</l>

       <l n="1">He bent above : so still her breath</l>
       <l n="2">What air she breathed he could not say ,</l>
       <l n="3">Whether in worlds of life or death :</l>
       <l n="4">So softly ebbed away , away</l>
       <l n="5">The life that had been light to him ,</l>
       <l n="6">So fled her beauty leaving dim</l>
       <l n="7">The emptying chambers of his heart</l>
       <l n="8">Thrilled only by the pang and smart ,</l>
       <l n="9">The dull and throbbing agony</l>
       <l n="10">That suffers still , yet knows not why .</l>
       <l n="11">Love 's immortality so blind</l>
       <l n="12">Dreams that all things with it conjoined</l>

       <l n="15">The touch , the eyes , the laugh , the kiss ,</l>
       <l n="16">Fall from it and it goes its way .</l>
       <l n="17">So blind he wept above her clay ,</l>
       <l n="18">‘ I did not think that you could die .</l>
       <l n="19">Only some veil would cover you</l>
       <l n="20">Our loving eyes could still pierce through ;</l>
       <l n="21">And see through dusky shadows still</l>
       <l n="22">Move as of old your wild sweet will ,</l>
       <l n="23">Impatient every heart to win</l>
       <l n="24">And flash its heavenly radiance in . ’</l>
       <l n="25">Though all the worlds were sunk in rest</l>
       <l n="26">The ruddy star within his breast</l>
       <l n="27">Would croon its tale of ancient pain ,</l>
       <l n="28">Its sorrow that would never wane ,</l>
       <l n="29">Its memory of the days of yore</l>
       <l n="30">Moulded in beauty evermore .</l>
       <l n="31">Ah , immortality so blind ,</l>
       <l n="32">To dream all things with it conjoined</l>
       <l n="33">Must follow it from star to star</l>
       <l n="34">And share with it immortal years .</l>
       <l n="35">The memory , yearning , grief , and tears ,</l>
       <l n="36">Fall from it and it goes afar .</l>
       <l n="37">He walked at night along the sands ,</l>
       <l n="38">And saw the stars dance overhead ,</l>
       <l n="39">He had no memory of the dead ,</l>
       <l n="40">But lifted up exultant hands</l>
       <l n="41">To hail the future like a boy ,</l>
       <l n="42">The myriad paths his feet might press .</l>
       <l n="43">Unhaunted by old tenderness</l>
       <l n="44">He felt an inner secret joy !</l>
       <l n="45">A spirit of unfettered will</l>
       <l n="46">Through light and darkness moving still</l>
       <l n="47">Within the All to find its own ,</l>
