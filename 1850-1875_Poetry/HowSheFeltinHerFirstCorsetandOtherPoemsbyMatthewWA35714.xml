     <l n="2">It occurred at Belgrade , where the genial Tom Quaw ,</l>
     <l n="3">Gave a party , the first that the town ever saw ;</l>
     <l n="4">The youth and the beauty , the tillers of soil ,</l>
     <l n="5">Attended that night , seeking surcease from toil .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">There were farmers whose hair had a tinge of the gray ;</l>
     <l n="7">There were maidens than whom none were ever more gay ;</l>
     <l n="8">There were youths who could ride anything that wears hair ,</l>
     <l n="9">And matrons whose faces showed lines of dull care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Of the ladies who on this occasion took part ,</l>
     <l n="11">Some were dressed in the nobbiest style of the art ;</l>
     <l n="12">And the others , unmindful of fashion 's decrees ,</l>
     <l n="13">Were attired to have much more comfort and ease .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">There was one blushing damsel , just budding sixteen ,</l>
     <l n="15">Whose waist by a corset ne'er encircled had been ,</l>
     <l n="16">But whose mother insisted that on such a night</l>
     <l n="17">One should find a place there , and the lacing be tight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">So the girl was rigged out as the mother desired ,</l>
     <l n="19">But of dancing ‘ twas noticed the damsel soon tired .</l>
     <l n="20">“ What 's the matter ? ” was asked by some one at her side .</l>
     <l n="21">“ I feel just like bucking , ” the maiden replied .</l>

    <head>TO THOSE WHO HOLD THE GUIDING REINS .</head>
     <l n="1">I have observed a steed , proud-spirited ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lashed by a cruel driver till the sweat</l>
     <l n="3">Stood out in beaded drops upon his side ;</l>
     <l n="4">And , oftimes , tears have welled up in my eyes</l>
     <l n="5">As in my mind I 've pictured human hearts</l>
     <l n="6">Lashed thus by cruel words and goaded on .</l>
     <l n="7">Then when , at other times , the same proud steed</l>
     <l n="8">Has passed along the street with arched neck ,</l>
     <l n="9">With every motion breathing force and vim ,</l>
     <l n="10">I 've noticed kindness held the guiding reins</l>
     <l n="11">And kept in check the zealous prancer 's power .</l>
     <l n="12">My mind has pictured then , with kindlier glow ,</l>
     <l n="13">A heart ambitious , far too keen to go ,</l>
     <l n="14">Kept by sweet loving words in proper bounds ;</l>
     <l n="15">And deepest gratitude , at such a time ,</l>
     <l n="16">Wells up for those who hold the guiding reins .</l>

    <head>A LOVE LETTER AND ITS ANSWER .</head>
    <head>A MONTANIAN TO HIS SWEETHEART .</head>
     <l n="1">Darling , I love thee ! Other words might tell</l>
     <l n="2">A trifle of how dear thou art to me ,</l>
     <l n="3">But these tell all . Of thee I might have said ,</l>
     <l n="4">And said in truth , at that , that all thy ways ,</l>
     <l n="5">Thine every motion , look and glance , as well ,</l>
     <l n="6">Did charm the inmost recess of my soul :</l>
     <l n="7">In words of praise , and those in justice due ,</l>
     <l n="8">I might the beauties of thy mind portray ;</l>
     <l n="9">For they outrival charms that in thy face</l>
     <l n="10">I see , as elsewhere I have failed to find :</l>
     <l n="11">Thy modesty , thy grace , thy love of all</l>
     <l n="12">That tends to elevate , to purify ,</l>
     <l n="13">And make a fellow mortal happier ,</l>
     <l n="14">I might have dwelt on to a length that thou ,</l>
     <l n="15">And thou alone , deserves from one whose pen</l>
     <l n="16">Is feeble in thy praise as is mine own .</l>
     <l n="17">Still , had I done so , and withheld the words ,</l>
     <l n="18">“ I love thee ! ” I had never told thee half .</l>
     <l n="19">I love thee , darling ! Ah ! indeed , I do !</l>
     <l n="20">Beyond the shadow of a doubt , I love ,</l>
     <l n="21">And such a one as any prince or king</l>
     <l n="22">Might gladly love and proudly call his own .</l>
     <l n="23">But , come to think , this love is all I have :</l>
     <l n="24">No titled rank is mine — no Astor 's wealth ;</l>
     <l n="25">And one you know , can n't live on love alone ;</l>
     <l n="26">Ah , no ! But better starve for lack of bread</l>
     <l n="27">Than want of love ; for when we starve for bread ,</l>
     <l n="28">And hunger knaws with all its well-known force ,</l>
     <l n="29">A day and all desire for food grows weak ,</l>
     <l n="30">And in its stead one craves but rest and sleep :</l>
     <l n="31">These come , and few the days ere dreamless sleep</l>
     <l n="32">Supplies the place of all desires and pains .</l>
     <l n="33">But , starve for love , and when doth come relief ?</l>
     <l n="34">The weary soul still lives , or drags along —</l>
     <l n="35">As pris'ner doomed for life goes to his work ;</l>
     <l n="36">Ambitionless it moves , its purpose dead ,</l>
     <l n="37">Yet ling'ring like ‘ twere powerless to go ;</l>
     <l n="38">Struggling ‘ twixt hope and fear , as thro ’ the bars</l>
     <l n="39">A gleam of sunshine flitters now and then ,</l>
     <l n="40">Glad'ning the while it shines , to leave more dark</l>
     <l n="41">The gloomy dungeon of an unloved life ;</l>
     <l n="42">Moving , as moves the lifeless rock or ore</l>
     <l n="43">When those with life exert o'er it their power ;</l>
     <l n="44">Living ! Ah , yes ! But devil never cursed</l>
     <l n="45">His vilest victim with a death so dread ;</l>
     <l n="46">Standing , as stands an engine on the track ,</l>
     <l n="47">Perfectly built in all its mighty parts ,</l>
     <l n="48">Its boiler and its furnace amply fed ,</l>
     <l n="49">Yet powerless . But , let the flame of love</l>
     <l n="50">Touch but one splinter of the waiting pyre ,</l>
     <l n="51">And all is changed . In gladsome bounds the blaze</l>
     <l n="52">Leaps on and on , till burning with one flame ,</l>
     <l n="53">The fire warms the slumb'ring soul to life ;</l>
     <l n="54">Warms till , as love directs , its living proves —</l>
     <l n="55">When under wisdom 's hands — man 's highest bliss .</l>
     <l n="56">Yes , when love fills the heart , behold how strong ,</l>
     <l n="57">How powerful one stands ! His muscles ache</l>
     <l n="58">With pure strength , and long for that on which</l>
     <l n="59">Their latent power to show ; and not alone</l>
     <l n="60">In idle longings doth a lover stand ,</l>
     <l n="61">But works alike with both his head and hands</l>
     <l n="62">To gain desired ends . Doth one lack means ?</l>
     <l n="63">Then love supplies a purpose and desire ,</l>
     <l n="64">And rests not still till they are at command .</l>
     <l n="65">Doth one feel weak ? Then love doth make him strong .</l>
     <l n="66">Is one a slave to appetite or care ?</l>
     <l n="67">Then love doth free him from the galling chains .</l>
     <l n="68">Doth one lack knowledge or attainments rare ?</l>
     <l n="69">Then love spurs on till all of these are gained .</l>
     <l n="70">Yes love , and that alone , is all I have ;</l>
     <l n="71">But , darling , having that , I offer thee</l>
     <l n="72">More than all else another man can give ,</l>
     <l n="73">Who hath abundance , and is rich in all</l>
     <l n="74">Save love , and that for thee , and thee alone .</l>
     <l n="75">This is my plea . I stand and wait my fate .</l>
     <l n="76">If thou dost love me , darling , tell me so ;</l>
     <l n="77">If not — but that can never be , I know .</l>

    <head>THE ANSWER SHE GAVE HIM .</head>
     <l n="1">Your note to me , of recent date ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where you are so importunate ,</l>
     <l n="3">Has been received , and I have read ,</l>
     <l n="4">With greatest care , what you have said .</l>
     <l n="5">I am quite pleased that you can see</l>
     <l n="6">So much to praise in one like me ,</l>
     <l n="7">And only wish that I could say</l>
     <l n="8">Nice things in such a pretty way .</l>
     <l n="9">But , tell me ! do you really think</l>
     <l n="10">That love is better than “ the chink ? ”</l>
     <l n="11">Why , money rules the world to-day ,</l>
     <l n="12">With strong and unresistless sway !</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Tis little schoolboys talk of love .</l>
     <l n="14">But as they older grow , improve ;</l>
     <l n="15">While girls , though they be very young ,</l>
     <l n="16">Know better but may hold their tongue .</l>
     <l n="17">If you have money , then you can</l>
     <l n="18">Go where you will , and be a man ;</l>
     <l n="19">But if you 're poor — a genius , too —</l>
     <l n="20">Your family can be but blue ,</l>
     <l n="21">While oft you 'll wish for food to eat ,</l>
     <l n="22">And for firm friends your heart to greet .</l>
     <l n="23">You own you 're poor , yet ask of me</l>
     <l n="24">To share a poor man 's misery !</l>
     <l n="25">Why men would be real scarce indeed ,</l>
     <l n="26">Ere I should think to feel the need</l>
     <l n="27">Of one who nothing has but love !</l>
     <l n="28">Poor men abound where'er we rove ,</l>
     <l n="29">And I can get one any day :</l>
     <l n="30">( When rich , pray call around this way ) .</l>
     <l n="31">Suppose we loved , and married were ,</l>
     <l n="32">And fortune gave to us an heir ,</l>
     <l n="33">Pray who would nurse and care for it ?</l>
     <l n="34">Who train its mind ? who mould its wit ?</l>
     <l n="35">Who 'd wash the dishes , cook the food ,</l>
     <l n="36">Do out-door chores , and cut the wood ?</l>
     <l n="37">What buggy rides would I receive ?</l>
     <l n="38">How many friends would to me cleave ?</l>
     <l n="39">And then there 's concerts to attend ,</l>
     <l n="40">And other places , that transcend</l>
     <l n="41">The theaters and balls that now</l>
     <l n="42">We with unstinted praise endow .</l>
     <l n="43">Oh , no ! do n't ask of me to wed</l>
     <l n="44">A loving fellow , though his head</l>
     <l n="45">Be better filled with brains than those</l>
     <l n="46">Who dress themselves in finer clothes :</l>
     <l n="47">I want a man who 's rich in stocks —</l>
     <l n="48">( D'ye think I 'd ever darn old socks ? )</l>
     <l n="49">You talk of love and lovers bold ,</l>
     <l n="50">As though I 'd care if icy cold</l>
     <l n="51">Were heart of him to whom with pride</l>
     <l n="52">My loving heart I 'd fondly tied .</l>
     <l n="53">I would be rich and nothing care ,</l>
     <l n="54">For I 'd have lover 's everywhere ;</l>
     <l n="55">And when of one I tired grew ,</l>
     <l n="56">I 'd take my pick and love anew .</l>
     <l n="57">Now do n't be angry with me , pray ,</l>
     <l n="58">For what I 've written you to-day ;</l>
     <l n="59">You were to me so frank and true</l>
     <l n="60">I could not well be less to you ;</l>
     <l n="61">So I have said what all must feel ,</l>
     <l n="62">Though some , I know , the facts conceal .</l>
     <l n="63">Then do not seek just now to wed ,</l>
     <l n="64">But wait until you 're rich , instead .</l>
