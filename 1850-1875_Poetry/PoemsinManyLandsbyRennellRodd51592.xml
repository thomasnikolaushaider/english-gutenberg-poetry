We looked towards the deep dark blue Beyond our window bars , And into all our dreaming drew The spirit of the stars . We did not see the world asleep — We were already there ! We did not find the way so steep To climb that starry stair . And faint at first and fitfully , Then sweet and shrill and near , We heard the eternal harmony That only angels hear ; And many a hue of many a gem We found for you to wear , And many a shining diadem To bind about your hair . We saw beneath us faint and far The little cloudlets strewn , And I became a wandering star , And you became my moon . Ah ! have you found our starry skies ? Where are you all the years ? Oh , moon of many memories ! Oh , star of many tears !</item>

    <head>THE DAISY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">With little white leaves in the grasses ,</l>
     <l n="2">Spread wide for the smile of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="3">It waits till the daylight passes ,</l>
     <l n="4">And closes them one by one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I have asked why it closed at even ,</l>
     <l n="6">And I know what it wished to say :</l>
     <l n="7">There are stars all night in the heaven ,</l>
     <l n="8">And I am the star of day .</l>

    <head>“ THOSE DAYS ARE LONG DEPARTED .”</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Those days are long departed ,</l>
     <l n="2">Gone where the dead dreams are ,</l>
     <l n="3">Since we two children started</l>
     <l n="4">To look for the morning star .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">We asked our way of the swallow</l>
     <l n="6">In his language that we knew ,</l>
     <l n="7">We were sad we could not follow</l>
     <l n="8">So swift the dark bird flew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">We set our wherry drifting</l>
     <l n="10">Between the poplar trees ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the banks of meadows shifting</l>
     <l n="12">Were the shores of unknown seas .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">We talked of the white snow prairies</l>
     <l n="14">That lie by the Northern lights ,</l>
     <l n="15">And of woodlands where the fairies</l>
     <l n="16">Are seen in the moonlit nights .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Till one long day was over</l>
     <l n="18">And we grew too tired to roam ,</l>
     <l n="19">And through the corn and clover</l>
     <l n="20">We slowly wandered home .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Ah child ! with love and laughter</l>
     <l n="22">We had journeyed out so far ;</l>
     <l n="23">We who went in the big years after</l>
     <l n="24">To look for another star ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">But I go unbefriended</l>
     <l n="26">Through wind and rain and foam ,—</l>
     <l n="27">One day was hardly ended</l>
     <l n="28">When the angel took you home .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IN APRIL .</head>
     <l n="1">The diamond dew lies cool</l>
     <l n="2">In the violet cups athirst ,</l>
     <l n="3">The buds are ready to burst ,</l>
     <l n="4">The heart of the spring is full ;</l>
     <l n="5">Great clouds dream over the sky ,</l>
     <l n="6">The drops on the grass-blades glisten ,</l>
     <l n="7">The daffodil droops to listen</l>
     <l n="8">As the wind from the South goes by ,</l>
     <l n="9">For it came through the sea cliffs hollow ,</l>
     <l n="10">With the dawning over the bay ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the swallow , it said , the swallow ,</l>
     <l n="12">The swallow comes home to-day .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IN THE WOODS .</head>
     <l n="1">This is a simple song</l>
     <l n="2">That the world sings every day ,</l>
     <l n="3">Hark ! as ye pass along</l>
     <l n="4">Ye that go by the way !</l>
     <l n="5">For the nightingale up in the oak-bough sings ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Be loyal , be true , true , true ,”</l>
     <l n="7">And the wood-dove sits with its folded wings ,</l>
     <l n="8">And answers “ to you , to you .”</l>
     <l n="9">And the thrush in the hedge , “ I am glad , be glad ,”</l>
     <l n="10">And the linnet , “ let love , let live ,”</l>
     <l n="11">And the wind in the rushes says , “ why so sad !”</l>
     <l n="12">And the wind in the trees “ forgive !”</l>
     <l n="13">While ever so high in the skies above</l>
     <l n="14">The heart of the lark o ’ erflows ,</l>
     <l n="15">And “ I love , I love , and I love ,”</l>
     <l n="16">Is the only song he knows .</l>
     <l n="17">Hark ! as ye pass along</l>
     <l n="18">Ye that go by the way !</l>
     <l n="19">This is the simple song</l>
     <l n="20">That the world sings every day .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>A SUMMER SONG .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Summer in the world and morning , the far hills were in the mist ,</l>
     <l n="2">And we watched the river borders , how the rush and ripple kist ,</l>
     <l n="3">While the bird sang “ Whither , whither ,” and the wind said ,</l>
     <l n="4">“ Where I list .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And we saw the yellow kingcup , and the arrowhead look through ,</l>
     <l n="6">From the silent , shallow waters , where the mirrored skies were blue ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the flags about the swan ’ s nest kept the secret that we knew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">In the hedge a thrush was singing , where the wild hopclusters are ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the lowly ragged-robin , with its frailly fretted star ,</l>
     <l n="10">While a soft wind brought the fragrance of the meadow-sweet from far .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="11">All its blushing bells a ’ ringing , on a bank the foxglove grows ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where the honeysuckle tangles in the thorns of the wild rose ,</l>
     <l n="13">And a sudden sea of blue-bells from the wood-side overflows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">And we watched the silver crescent of the wings of the wild dove</l>
     <l n="15">Circle swiftly in the sunlight through the aspen tops above ,</l>
     <l n="16">And we felt the great world ’ s heart beat , in the gladness of our love .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE BURDEN OF AUTUMN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We are dying , said the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="2">All the days are out of tune ,</l>
     <l n="3">Spent are all the sungold hours ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the glory that was June ,</l>
     <l n="5">Dying , dying said the flowers .</l>
     <l n="6">The snow will hide the garden bed</l>
     <l n="7">While they sleep underground ,</l>
     <l n="8">Wild winds will drift it overhead ,</l>
     <l n="9">But they will slumber sound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">We are going , said the swallows ,</l>
     <l n="11">All the singing days are done ,</l>
     <l n="12">Summer ’ s over , winter follows ,</l>
     <l n="13">And we seek a warmer sun ,</l>
     <l n="14">Going southward , said the swallows .</l>
     <l n="15">And I must watch them all depart</l>
     <l n="16">And find no song to sing ,</l>
     <l n="17">Oh take the autumn from my heart</l>
     <l n="18">And give me back the spring !</l>
    </lg>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>“ TO WONDER AND BE STILL .”</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oft in the starry middle night</l>
     <l n="2">I vex my heart in vain ,</l>
     <l n="3">To set its mystic music right ,</l>
     <l n="4">And find the hidden strain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">To-night the summer moon is strong ,</l>
     <l n="6">The little clouds drift past ,—</l>
     <l n="7">The wonder is too deep for song —</l>
     <l n="8">The silence speaks at last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Thou canst not match those harmonies</l>
     <l n="10">On moon-enamoured lute ,</l>
     <l n="11">Serenely silent arch the skies ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the great stars are mute ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ Thou canst not tune to thine unrest</l>
     <l n="14">Their solemn calm above ;</l>
     <l n="15">In silence thou shalt worship best ,</l>
     <l n="16">And reverently love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">“ Beyond this night in which thou art ,</l>
     <l n="18">There is a voice of spheres ,</l>
     <l n="19">Which the eternal in thine heart</l>
     <l n="20">Remembers and reveres .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">“ But how they sing in unison</l>
     <l n="22">Earth ’ s ear hath never heard ,</l>
     <l n="23">So only in thine heart rings on</l>
     <l n="24">The song that has no word .”</l>

    <head>AN ANSWER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Take again thy shallow hearted reason</l>
     <l n="2">Groping dimly through the night in which thou art !</l>
     <l n="3">Very harmless fall the arrows of thy treason</l>
     <l n="4">On the worship and the wonder in my heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I have drunk the everlasting fountains</l>
     <l n="6">Flowing downward from the infinite to me ,</l>
     <l n="7">Seen the wonder of the moonrise in the mountains</l>

    <head>THE POET .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">HE will come again as oft of old among you ,</l>
     <l n="2">With his burden to fulfil ;—</l>
     <l n="3">Did ye hearken ever to the songs they sung you</l>
     <l n="4">Till the song was still ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">HE will bear again the scorn , the idle wonder ,</l>
     <l n="6">And heart-hunger and love ’ s need ;</l>

     <l n="8">And he will not heed .</l>

     <l n="9">Singing unperplexed above the mocking laughter</l>
     <l n="10">Till his day be overpast ;</l>

     <l n="1">This then — to live and have no joy thereof ,</l>
     <l n="2">To thirst and hunger and be very tired ,</l>
     <l n="3">To walk unloved , or know if one should love</l>
     <l n="4">It were a bitter thing that he desired ,</l>
     <l n="5">To have no home in all the earth , to be</l>
     <l n="6">Mocked and derided and outcast of men ,</l>
     <l n="7">To squander love and labour , and to see</l>
     <l n="8">No fruit of it , and yet to love , and then</l>
     <l n="9">Bearing all slander silently alway ,</l>
     <l n="10">Serenely when the last reproach is hurled</l>

     <l n="1">A sweet still night of the vintage time ,</l>

    <head>AT TIBER MOUTH .</head>
     <l n="1">The low plains stretch to the west with a glimmer of rustling weeds ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where the waves of a golden river wind home by the marshy meads ;</l>
     <l n="3">And the fresh wind born of the sea grows faint with a sickly breath ,</l>
     <l n="4">As it stays in the fretting rushes and blows on the dews of death .</l>
     <l n="5">We came to the silent city , in the glare of the noontide heat ,</l>
     <l n="6">When the sound of a whisper rang through the length of the lonely street ;</l>
     <l n="7">No tree in the clefted ruin , no echo of song nor sound ,</l>
     <l n="8">But the dust of a world forgotten lay under the barren ground .</l>
     <l n="9">There are shrines under these green hillocks to the beautiful</l>
     <l n="10">gods that sleep ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where they prayed in the stormy season for lives gone out on the deep ;</l>
     <l n="12">And here in the grave street sculptured , old record of loves and tears ,</l>
     <l n="13">By the dust of the nameless slave , forgotten a thousand years .</l>
     <l n="14">Not ever again at even shall ship sail in on the breeze ,</l>
     <l n="15">Where the hulls of their gilded galleys came home from a hundred seas ,</l>
     <l n="16">For the marsh plants grow in her haven , the marsh birds breed in her bay ,</l>
     <l n="17">And a mile to the shoreless westward the water has passed away .</l>
     <l n="18">But the sea-folk gathering rushes come up from the windy shore ,</l>
     <l n="19">So the song that the years have silenced grows musical there once more ;</l>
     <l n="20">And now and again unburied , like some still voice from the dead ,</l>
     <l n="21">They light on the fallen shoulder and the lines of a marble head .</l>
     <l n="22">But we went from the sorrowful city and wandered away at will ,</l>
     <l n="23">And thought of the breathing marble and the words that are music still .</l>
     <l n="24">How full were their lives that laboured , in their fetterless</l>
     <l n="25">strength and far</l>
     <l n="26">From the ways that our feet have chosen as the sunlight is from the star ,</l>
     <l n="27">They clung to the chance and promise that once while the years are free</l>
     <l n="28">Look over our life ’ s horizon as the sun looks over the sea ,</l>
     <l n="29">But we wait for a day that dawns not , and cry for unclouded skies ,</l>
     <l n="30">And while we are deep in dreaming the light that was o ’ er us dies ;</l>
     <l n="31">We know not what of the present we shall stretch out our hand to save</l>
     <l n="32">Who sing of the life we long for , and not of the life we have ;</l>
     <l n="33">And yet if the chance were with us to gather the days misspent ,</l>
     <l n="34">Should we change the old resting-places , the wandering ways we went ?</l>
     <l n="35">They were strong , but the years are stronger ; they are grown</l>
     <l n="36">but a name that thrills ,</l>
     <l n="37">And the wreck of their marble glory lies ghost-like over their hills .</l>
     <l n="38">So a shadow fell o ’ er our dreaming for the weary heart of the past ,</l>
     <l n="39">For the seed that the years have scattered , to reap so little at last .</l>
     <l n="40">And we went to the sea-shore forest , through a long colonnade of pines ,</l>
     <l n="41">Where the skies peep in and the sea , with a flitting of silver lines .</l>
     <l n="42">And we came on an open place in the green deep heart of the wood</l>
     <l n="43">Where I think in the years forgotten an altar of Faunus stood ;</l>
     <l n="44">From a spring in the long dark grasses two rivulets rise and run</l>
     <l n="45">By the length of their sandy borders where the snake lies</l>
     <l n="46">coiled in the sun .</l>
     <l n="47">And the stars of the white narcissus lie over the grass like snow ,</l>
     <l n="48">And beyond in the shadowy places the crimson cyclamens grow ;</l>
     <l n="49">Far up from their wave home yonder the sea-winds murmuring pass ,</l>
     <l n="50">The branches quiver and creak and the lizard starts in the grass .</l>
     <l n="51">And we lay in the untrod moss and pillowed our cheeks with flowers ,</l>
     <l n="52">While the sun went over our heads , and we took no count of the hours ;</l>
     <l n="53">From the end of the waving branches and under the cloudless blue ,</l>
     <l n="54">Like sunbeams chained for a banner , the thread-like gossamers flew .</l>
     <l n="55">And the joy of the woods came o ’ er us , and we felt that our</l>
     <l n="56">world was young</l>
     <l n="57">With the gladness of years unspent and the sorrow of life unsung .</l>
     <l n="58">So we passed with a sound of singing along to the seaward way ,</l>
     <l n="59">Where the sails of the fishermen folk came homeward over the bay ;</l>
     <l n="60">For a cloud grew over the forest and darkened the sea-god ’ s shrine ,</l>
     <l n="61">And the hills of the silent city were only a ruby line .</l>
     <l n="62">But the sun stood still on the waves as we passed from the fading shores ,</l>
     <l n="63">And shone on our boat ’ s red bulwarks and the golden blades of the oars ,</l>
     <l n="64">And it seemed as we steered for the sunset that we passed</l>
     <l n="65">through a twilight sea ,</l>
     <l n="66">From the gloom of a world forgotten to the light of a world to be .</l>

     <l n="34">Ye crave new signs and wonders to convince</l>
     <l n="35">And wander lost upon your devious ways .</l>
     <l n="36">Ye will but gaze upon a part , and grow</l>
     <l n="37">In little wisdom overwise , therefore</l>
     <l n="38">Your partial grasp is barren to conceive</l>
     <l n="39">The thought Infinity , Time wilders yet</l>
     <l n="40">Because ye measure with your finite gauge ,</l>
     <l n="41">And Motion maddens through your own unrest .</l>
     <l n="42">He let the world go gladly , hand in hand</l>
     <l n="43">He walked with Reason , till thought strained away</l>
     <l n="44">And God grew nearer ,— so he built his mind</l>
     <l n="45">A bridge to span from sun to sun of all</l>
     <l n="46">The starry systems ;— like a faint far dream</l>
     <l n="47">The changing pageant of men ’ s lives unrolled ,</l>
     <l n="48">And he stood by serenely ,— but with him</l>
     <l n="49">The calm was struggle in a lordlier way ,</l>
     <l n="50">Absorbed and dwelling with eternal truth ,</l>
     <l n="51">Whose star o ’ ershone him ; till it seemed that life</l>
     <l n="52">And death were one , and from the throbbing brow</l>
     <l n="53">The craving died away ,— and now he rests</l>
     <l n="54">With that fair choir from many times whose souls</l>
     <l n="55">Have earned the right of knowledge after death .</l>
