      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">“ Now since mine even is come at last ,—</l>
       <l n="3">For I have been the sport of steel ,</l>
       <l n="4">And hot life ebbeth from me fast ,</l>
       <l n="5">And I in saddle roll and reel ,—</l>
       <l n="6">Come bind me , bind me on my steed !</l>
       <l n="7">Of fingering leech I have no need ! ”</l>
       <l n="8">The chaplain clasped his mailed knee .</l>
       <l n="9">“ Nor need I more thy whine and thee !</l>
       <l n="10">No time is left my sins to tell ;</l>
       <l n="11">But look ye bind me , bind me well ! ”</l>
       <l n="12">They bound him strong with leathern thong ,</l>
       <l n="13">For the ride to the lady should be long .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="14">Day was dying ; the poplars fled ,</l>
       <l n="15">Thin as ghosts , on a sky blood-red ;</l>
       <l n="16">Out of the sky the fierce hue fell ,</l>
       <l n="17">And made the streams as the streams of hell .</l>
       <l n="18">All his thoughts as a river flowed ,</l>
       <l n="19">Flowed aflame as fleet he rode ,</l>
       <l n="20">Onward flowed to her abode ,</l>
       <l n="21">Ceased at her feet , mirrored her face .</l>
       <l n="22">( Viewless Death apace , apace ,</l>
       <l n="23">Rode behind him in that race . )</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="24">“ Face , mine own , mine alone ,</l>
       <l n="25">Trembling lips my lips have known ,</l>
       <l n="26">Birdlike stir of the dove-soft eyne</l>
       <l n="27">Under the kisses that make them mine !</l>
       <l n="28">Only of thee , of thee , my need !</l>
       <l n="29">Only to thee , to thee , I speed ! ”</l>
       <l n="30">The Cross flashed by at the highway 's turn ;</l>
       <l n="31">In a beam of the moon the Face shone stern .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="32">Far behind had the fight 's din died ;</l>
       <l n="33">The shuddering stars in the welkin wide</l>
       <l n="34">Crowded , crowded , to see him ride .</l>
       <l n="35">The beating hearts of the stars aloof</l>
       <l n="36">kept time to the beat of the horse 's hoof ,</l>
       <l n="37">“ What is the throb that thrills so sweet ?</l>
       <l n="38">Heart of my lady , I feel it beat ! ”</l>
       <l n="39">But his own strong pulse the fainter fell ,</l>
       <l n="40">Like the failing tongue of a hushing bell .</l>
       <l n="41">The flank of the great-limbed steed was wet</l>
       <l n="42">Not alone with the started sweat .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="43">Fast , and fast , and the thick black wood</l>
       <l n="44">Arched its cowl like a black friar 's hood ;</l>
       <l n="45">Fast , and fast , and they plunged therein ,—</l>
       <l n="46">But the viewless rider rode to win ,</l>
       <l n="47">Out of the wood to the highway 's light</l>
       <l n="48">Galloped the great-limbed steed in fright ;</l>
       <l n="49">The mail clashed cold , and the sad owl cried ,</l>
       <l n="50">And the weight of the dead oppressed his side .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="51">Fast , and fast , by the road he knew ;</l>
       <l n="52">And slow , and slow , the stars withdrew ;</l>
       <l n="53">And the waiting heaven turned weirdly blue ,</l>
       <l n="54">As a garment worn of a wizard grim .</l>
       <l n="55">He neighed at the gate in the morning dim .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="56">She heard no sound before her gate ,</l>
       <l n="57">Though very quiet was her bower .</l>
       <l n="58">All was as her hand had left it late :</l>
       <l n="59">The needle slept on the broidered vine ,</l>
       <l n="60">Where the hammer and spikes of the passion-flower</l>
       <l n="61">Her fashioning did wait .</l>
       <l n="62">On the couch lay something fair ,</l>
       <l n="63">With steadfast lips and veiled eyne ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="64">But the lady was not there ,</l>
       <l n="65">On the wings of shrift and prayer ,</l>
       <l n="66">Pure as winds that winnow snow ,</l>
       <l n="67">Her soul had risen twelve hours ago .</l>
       <l n="68">The burdened steed at the barred gate stood ,</l>
       <l n="69">No whit the nearer to his goal .</l>
       <l n="70">Now God 's great grace assoil the soul</l>
       <l n="71">That went out in the wood !</l>

      <head>THE FIRST GUEST</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">When the house is finished , Death enters .</l>
       <l n="2">Eastern Proverb</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Life 's House being ready all ,</l>
       <l n="4">Each chamber fair and dumb ,</l>
       <l n="5">Ere life , the Lord , is come</l>
       <l n="6">With pomp into his hall ,—</l>
       <l n="7">Ere Toil has trod the floors ,</l>
       <l n="8">Ere Love has lit the fires ,</l>
       <l n="9">Or young great-eyed Desires</l>
       <l n="10">Have , timid , tried the doors ;</l>
       <l n="11">Or from east-window leaned</l>
       <l n="12">One Hope , to greet the sun ,</l>
       <l n="13">Or one gray Sorrow screened</l>
       <l n="14">Her sight against the west ,—</l>
       <l n="15">Then enters the first guest ,</l>
       <l n="16">The House of life being done .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">He waits there in the shade .</l>
       <l n="18">I deem he is Life 's twin ,</l>
       <l n="19">For whom the house was made .</l>
       <l n="20">Whatever his true name ,</l>
       <l n="21">Be sure , to enter in</l>
       <l n="22">He has both key and claim .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="23">The daybeams , free of fear ,</l>
       <l n="24">Creep drowsy toward his feet ;</l>
       <l n="25">His heart were heard to beat ,</l>
       <l n="26">Were any there to hear ;</l>
       <l n="27">Ah , not for ends malign ,</l>
       <l n="28">Like wild thing crouched in lair ,</l>
       <l n="29">Or watcher of a snare ,</l>
       <l n="30">But with a friend 's design</l>
       <l n="31">He lurks in shadow there !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="32">He goes not to the gates</l>
       <l n="33">To welcome any other ,</l>
       <l n="34">Nay , not Lord Life , his brother ;</l>
       <l n="35">But still his hour awaits</l>
       <l n="36">Each several guest to find</l>
       <l n="37">Alone , yea , quite alone ;</l>
       <l n="38">Pacing with pensive mind</l>
       <l n="39">The cloister 's echoing stone ,</l>
       <l n="40">Or singing , unaware ,</l>
       <l n="41">At the turning of the stair</l>
       <l n="42">Tis truth , though we forget ,</l>
       <l n="43">In Life 's House enters none</l>
       <l n="44">Who shall that seeker shun ,</l>
       <l n="45">Who shall not so be met .</l>
       <l n="46">“ Is this mine hour ? ” each saith .</l>
       <l n="47">“ So be it , gentle Death ! ”</l>
       <l n="48">Each has his way to end ,</l>
       <l n="49">Encountering this friend .</l>
       <l n="50">Griefs die to memories mild ;</l>
       <l n="51">Hope turns a weanèd child ;</l>
       <l n="52">Love shines a spirit white ,</l>
       <l n="53">With eyes of deepened light .</l>
       <l n="54">When many a guest has passed ,</l>
       <l n="55">Some day ‘ tis Life 's at last</l>
       <l n="56">To front the face of Death .</l>
       <l n="57">Then , casements closed , men say :</l>
       <l n="58">“ Lord Life is gone away ;</l>
       <l n="59">He went , we trust and pray ,</l>
       <l n="60">To God , who gave him breath . ”</l>
       <l n="61">Beginning , End , He is :</l>
       <l n="62">Are not these sons both His ?</l>
       <l n="63">Lo , these with Him are one !</l>
       <l n="64">To phrase it so were best :</l>
       <l n="65">God 's self is that first Guest ,</l>
       <l n="66">The House of Life being done !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Why should I sing of earth or heaven ? not rather rest ,</l>
       <l n="2">Powerless to speak of that which hath my soul possessed ,—</l>
       <l n="3">For full possession dumb ? Yea , Silence , that were best .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">And though for what it failed to sound I brake the string ,</l>
       <l n="5">And dashed the sweet lute down , a too much fingered thing ,</l>
       <l n="6">And found a wild new voice ,— oh , still , why should I sing ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="7">An earth-song could I make , strange as the breath of earth ,</l>
       <l n="8">Filled with the great calm joy of life and death and birth ?</l>
       <l n="9">Yet , were it less than this , the song were little worth .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">For this the fields caress ; brown clods tell each to each ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="13">A heaven-song could I make , all fire that yet was peace ,</l>

      <head>THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The eastern heaven was all faint amethyst ,</l>
       <l n="2">Whereon the moon hung dreaming in the mist ;</l>
       <l n="3">To north yet drifted one long delicate plume</l>
       <l n="4">Of roseate cloud ; like snow the ocean-spume .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Now when the first foreboding swiftly ran</l>
       <l n="6">Through the loud-glorying sea that it began</l>
       <l n="7">To lose its late gained lordship of the land ,</l>
       <l n="8">Uprose the billow like an angered man ,</l>
       <l n="9">And flung its prone strength far along the sand ;</l>
       <l n="10">Almost , almost to the old bound , the dark</l>
       <l n="11">And taunting triumph-mark .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="12">But no , no , no ! and slow , and slow , and slow ,</l>
       <l n="13">Like a heart losing hold , this wave must go ,—</l>
       <l n="14">Must go , must go ,— dragged heavily back , back ,</l>
       <l n="15">Beneath the next wave plunging on its track ,</l>
       <l n="16">Charging , with thunderous and defiant shout ,</l>
       <l n="17">To fore-determined rout .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">Again , again the unexhausted main</l>
       <l n="19">Renews fierce effort , drawing force unguessed</l>
       <l n="20">From awful deeps of its mysterious breast :</l>
       <l n="21">Like arms of passionate protest , tossed in vain ,</l>
       <l n="22">The spray upflings above the billow 's crest .</l>
       <l n="23">Again the appulse , again the backward strain —</l>
       <l n="24">Till ocean must have rest .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">With one abandoned movement , swift and wild ,—</l>
       <l n="26">As though bowed head and outstretched arms it laid</l>
       <l n="27">On the earth 's lap , soft sobbing ,— hushed and stayed ,</l>
       <l n="28">The great sea quiets , like a soothed child .</l>
       <l n="29">Ha ! what sharp memory clove the calm , and drave</l>
       <l n="30">This last fleet furious wave ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">On , on , endures the struggle into night ,</l>
       <l n="32">Ancient as Time , yet fresh as the fresh hour ;</l>

      <head>KING RAEDWALD</head>
       <l n="1">Will you hear now the speech of King Raedwald ,— heathen Raedwald ,</l>
       <l n="2">the simple yet wise ?</l>
       <l n="3">He , the ruler of North-folk and South-folk , a man open-browed</l>
       <l n="4">as the skies ,</l>
       <l n="5">Held the eyes of the eager Italians with his blue , bold ,</l>
       <l n="6">Englishman 's eyes .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In his hall , on his throne , so he sat , with the light of the fire on him full : Colored bright as the ring of red gold on his hand , fit to buffet a bull , Was the mane that grew down on his neck , was the beard he would pondering pull .</p>
     <p>To the priests , to the eager Italians , thus fearless less he poured his free speech ; “ O my honey-tongued fathers , I turn not away from the faith that ye teach ! Not the less hath a man many moods , and may ask a religion for each .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Grant that all things are well with the realm on a delicate day</l>
       <l n="2">of the spring ,</l>
       <l n="3">Easter month , time of hopes and of swallows !</l>
       <l n="4">The praises , the psalms that ye sing ,</l>
       <l n="5">As in pleasant accord they float heavenward , are good in the ears</l>
       <l n="6">of the king .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Then the heart bubbles forth with clear waters , to the time of this wonder-word Peace , From the chanting and preaching whereof ye who serve the white Christ never cease ; And your curly , soft incense ascending enwraps my content like a fleece .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ But a churl comes adrip from the rivers , pants me out , fallen</l>
       <l n="2">spent on the floor ,</l>
       <l n="3">‘ O King Raedwald , Northumberland marches , and to-morrow knocks</l>
       <l n="4">hard at thy door ,</l>
       <l n="5">Hot for melting thy crown on the hearth ! ’</l>
       <l n="6">Then commend me to Woden and Thor !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Could I sit then and listen to preachments on turning the cheek to the blow , And saying a prayer for the smiter , and holding my seen treasure low For the sake of a treasure unseen ? By the sledge of the Thunderer , no !</p>
     <p>“ For my thought flashes out as a sword , cleaving counsel as clottage of cream ; And your incense and chanting are but as the smoke of burnt towns and the scream ; And I quaff me the thick mead of triumph from enemies ’ skulls in my dream !</p>
     <p>“ And ‘ tis therefore this day I resolve me ,— for King Raedwald will cringe not , nor lie !— I will bring back the altar of Woden ; in the temple will have it , hard by The new altar of this your white Christ . As my mood may decide , worship I ! ”</p>
     <p>So he spake in his large self-reliance ,— he , a man open-browed as the skies ; Would not measure his soul by a standard that was womanish-weak to his eyes , Smite his breast and go on with his sinning ,— savage Raedwald , the simple yet wise !</p>
     <p>And the centuries bloom o'er his barrow . But for us ,— have we mastered it quite , The old riddle , that sweet is strong 's outcome , the old marvel , that meekness is might , That the child is the leader of lions , that forgiveness is force at its height ?</p>
     <p>When we summon the shade of rude Raedwald , in his candor how king-like he towers ! Have the centuries , over his slumber , only borne sterile falsehoods for flowers ? Pray you , what if Christ found him the nobler , having weighed his frank manhood with ours ?</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Day in , day out , or sun or rain ,</l>
       <l n="2">Or sallow leaf , or summer grain ,</l>
       <l n="3">Beneath a wintry morning moon</l>
       <l n="4">Or through red smouldering afternoon ,</l>
       <l n="5">With simple joy , with careful pride ,</l>
       <l n="6">He plies the craft he long has plied :</l>
       <l n="7">To shape the stave , to set the sting ,</l>
       <l n="8">To fit the shaft with irised wing ;</l>
       <l n="9">And farers by may hear him sing ,</l>
       <l n="10">For still his door is wide :</l>
       <l n="11">“ Laugh and sigh , live and die ,—</l>
       <l n="12">The world swings round ; I know not , I ,</l>

       <l n="16">Some storied field fought long ago ,</l>
       <l n="17">Where arrows fell as thick as snow .</l>
       <l n="18">His breath comes fast , his eyes grow bright ,</l>
       <l n="19">To think upon that ancient fight .</l>
       <l n="20">Oh , leaping from the strained string</l>
       <l n="21">Against an armored Wrong to ring ,</l>
       <l n="22">Brave the songs that arrows sing !</l>
       <l n="23">He weighs the finished flight :</l>
       <l n="24">“ Live and die ; by and by</l>
       <l n="25">The sun kills dark ; I know not , I ,</l>
       <l n="26">In what good fight mine arrows fly ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="27">Or at the gray hour , weary grown ,</l>
       <l n="28">When curfew o'er the wold is blown ,</l>
       <l n="29">He sees , as in a magic glass ,</l>
       <l n="30">Some lost and lonely mountain-pass ;</l>
       <l n="31">And lo ! a sign of deathful rout</l>
       <l n="32">The mocking vine has wound about ,—</l>
       <l n="33">An earth-fixed arrow by a spring ,</l>
       <l n="34">All greenly mossed , a mouldered thing ;</l>
       <l n="35">That stifled shaft no more shall sing !</l>
       <l n="36">He shakes his head in doubt .</l>
       <l n="37">“ Laugh and sigh , live and die ,—</l>
       <l n="38">The hand is blind : I know not , I ,</l>
       <l n="39">In what lost pass mine arrows lie !</l>
       <l n="40">One to east , one to west ,</l>
       <l n="41">Another for the eagle 's breast ,—</l>
       <l n="42">The archer and the wind know best ! ”</l>
       <l n="43">The stars are in the sky ;</l>

       <l n="10">And power as easeful as his own he gave ;</l>
       <l n="11">Long broodings rich with sun , and laughters kind ;</l>
       <l n="12">And singing leaves , whose later bronze is dear</l>
       <l n="13">As the first amber of the budding year ,—</l>
       <l n="14">Whose voices answer the autumnnal wind .</l>

      <head>THE STRAYED SINGER</head>
      <head>( MATTHEW ARNOLD )</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">He wandered from us long , oh , long ago ,</l>
       <l n="2">Rare singer , with the note unsatisfied ;</l>
       <l n="3">Into what charmèd wood , what shade star-eyed</l>
       <l n="4">With the wind 's April darlings , none may know .</l>
       <l n="5">We lost him . Songless , one with seed to sow ,</l>
       <l n="6">Keen-smiling toiler , came in place , and plied</l>
       <l n="7">His strength in furrowed field till eventide ,</l>
       <l n="8">And passed to slumber when the sun was low .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">But now ,— as though Death spoke some mystic word</l>
       <l n="10">Solving a spell ,— present to thought appears</l>
       <l n="11">The morn 's estray , not him we saw but late ;</l>
       <l n="12">And on his lips the strain that once we heard ,</l>
       <l n="13">And in his hand , cool as with Springtime 's tears ,</l>
       <l n="14">The melancholy wood-flowers delicate .</l>

      <head>THE IMMORTAL WORD</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">One soiled and shamed and foiled in this world 's fight ,</l>
       <l n="2">Deserter from the host of God , that here</l>
       <l n="3">Still darkly struggles ,— waked from death in fear ,</l>
       <l n="4">And strove to screen his forehead from the white</l>
       <l n="5">And blinding glory of the awful Light ,</l>
       <l n="6">The revelation and reproach austere .</l>
       <l n="7">Then with strong hand outstretched a Shape drew near ,</l>
       <l n="8">Bright-browed , majestic , armored like a knight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">“ Great Angel , servant of the Highest , why</l>
       <l n="10">Stoop'st thou to me ? ” although his lips were mute ,</l>
       <l n="11">His eyes inquired . The Shining One replied :</l>
       <l n="12">“ Thy Book , thy birth , life of thy life am I ,</l>
       <l n="13">Son of thy soul , thy youth 's forgotten fruit .</l>
       <l n="14">We two go up to judgment side by side . ”</l>
