    <head>SOMETHING BY WAY OF PREFACE .</head>
     <l n="1">Good people , would you know the reason</l>
     <l n="2">I write at this unlucky season ,</l>
     <l n="3">When all the nation is so poor</l>
     <l n="4">That few can keep above one whore ,</l>
     <l n="5">Except the lawyers — ( whose large fees</l>
     <l n="6">Maintain as many as they please ) —</l>
     <l n="7">And Pope , with taste and judgement great ,</l>
     <l n="8">Has deign 'd this author to translate —</l>
     <l n="9">The reason 's this :— He may not please</l>
     <l n="10">The jocund tribe so well as these ;</l>
     <l n="11">For all capacities can n't climb</l>
     <l n="12">To comprehend the true sublime .</l>
     <l n="13">Another reason I can tell ,</l>
     <l n="14">Though silence might do full as well ;</l>
     <l n="15">But being charg 'd — discharge I must ,</l>
     <l n="16">For bladder , if too full , will burst .</l>
     <l n="17">The writers of the merry class ,</l>
     <l n="18">E'er since the time of Hudibras ,</l>
     <l n="19">In this strange blunder all agree ,</l>
     <l n="20">To murder short-legg 'd poetry .</l>
     <l n="21">Words , though design 'd to make ye smile ,</l>
     <l n="22">Why may n't they run as smooth as oil ?</l>
     <l n="23">No poetaster can convince</l>
     <l n="24">A man of any kind of sense ,</l>
     <l n="25">That verse can be the greater treasure ,</l>
     <l n="26">Because it wants both weight and measure</l>
     <l n="27">Or can persuade , that false rough metre ,</l>
     <l n="28">Than true and smooth , by far is sweeter .</l>
     <l n="29">This is the wherefore ; and the why ,</l>
     <l n="30">Have patience , you 'll see by-and-by .</l>

     <l n="151">Neighbours , can any Grecian say</l>
     <l n="152">We ought not all to run away</l>
     <l n="153">From this curst place without delay ?</l>
     <l n="154">Else soon our best and bravest cocks</l>
     <l n="155">Will be destroy 'd by plague or pox .</l>
     <l n="156">We cannot long , though Jove doth back us ,</l>

     <l n="158">I think ‘ tis time to spare the few</l>
     <l n="159">Our broils have left ; but what think you ?</l>
     <l n="160">A cunning man perhaps may tell us</l>
     <l n="161">The reason why this plague befel us</l>
     <l n="162">Or an old woman , that can dream ,</l>
     <l n="163">May help us out in this extreme ;</l>
     <l n="164">For dreams , if rightly you attend ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="165">Are true , when Jove thinks fit to send ‘ em .</l>
     <l n="166">Thus may we form some judgment what</l>
     <l n="167">This same Apollo would be at ;</l>
     <l n="168">Whether he mauls each wicked sinner ,</l>
     <l n="169">Because a mighty pimping dinner</l>

     <l n="171">That we had damn 'd short commons too .</l>
     <l n="172">If ‘ tis for that he makes such stir ,</l>
     <l n="173">He 's not the man I took him for :</l>

     <l n="175">I vote to pay him all arrears .</l>
     <l n="176">Therefore let such a man be found ,</l>

     <l n="179">In proper terms begin to pray ,</l>
     <l n="180">That he may ease us of these curses ,</l>
     <l n="181">And stay at home and mind his horses —</l>
     <l n="182">Much better bus'ness for the spark</l>

     <l n="11">For the remainder of that day ,</l>

     <l n="901">I 'll marry with the devil 's dam ,</l>

     <l n="1">Finding that no Achilles comes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Poor Agamemnon bites his thumbs ;</l>
     <l n="3">And though his heavy eyes kept winking ,</l>
     <l n="4">He could not steal a nod for thinking</l>
     <l n="5">How he from this unlucky scrape</l>
     <l n="6">Might with his ragged rogues escape :</l>
     <l n="7">For as says he , our woeful pickle</l>
     <l n="8">Requires that ev'ry man should stickle ,</l>
     <l n="9">Why should our Grecian lazy dogs</l>
     <l n="10">Keep snoring like distillers ’ hogs ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whilst I for gen'ral good am watching ,</l>
     <l n="12">And flaying all my rump with scratching ?</l>
     <l n="13">So up he gets , sans more ado ,</l>
     <l n="14">And sends the cuckold Menelau</l>
     <l n="15">To bring their comrades all together ,</l>
     <l n="16">That they might club their noddles , whether</l>
     <l n="17">They ought , in this great strait , to stay ,</l>
     <l n="18">Or take good start and ran away .</l>
     <l n="19">A council call 'd , they send from thence</l>
     <l n="20">Two spies , to &lt; i > steal &lt;/ i > intelligence ;</l>
     <l n="21">And &lt; i > steal &lt;/ i > they did for , by their prize ,</l>
     <l n="22">You 'd swear he sent two Yorkshire spies ,</l>
     <l n="23">For , after stealing sev'ral purses ,</l>
     <l n="24">They stole a special pair of horses .</l>

     <l n="1">The Greeks , though sorely drubb 'd all day ,</l>
     <l n="2">Asleep before their scullers lay —</l>
     <l n="3">All but poor Agamemnon , who</l>
     <l n="4">Could only nod a spell or so .</l>
     <l n="5">Distracted with a thousand fears</l>
     <l n="6">How to get off and save his ears ,</l>
     <l n="7">His fears did such a rumbling keep</l>
     <l n="8">Within his guts , he could not sleep .</l>
     <l n="9">As when a barrel of small-beer ,</l>
     <l n="10">No matter whether foul or clear ,</l>
     <l n="11">Begins to leak , drop follows drop</l>
     <l n="12">As fast as wanton schoolboys hop :</l>
     <l n="13">So quick this valiant Greek kept sighing .</l>
     <l n="14">At last he fairly fell a-crying ;</l>
     <l n="15">Then , with a face of rueful length ,</l>
     <l n="16">Peep 'd up to spy the Trojans ’ strength ;</l>
     <l n="17">When , to his wondrous great amaze ,</l>
     <l n="18">He saw a thousand bonfires blaze ,</l>
     <l n="19">And heard so plain the Trojans f — t ,</l>
     <l n="20">It vex 'd him to the guts and heart</l>
     <l n="21">To think the rogues were got so near ,</l>
     <l n="22">That he their very —— s could hear ;</l>
     <l n="23">Which sound he hated full as much</l>
     <l n="24">As Britons do the belching Dutch .</l>
     <l n="25">Whilst he was grunting in dispute</l>
     <l n="26">To hang himself or fight it out ,</l>
     <l n="27">He almost lugg 'd , at one smart pull</l>
     <l n="28">A pound of carrots from his skull ;</l>
     <l n="29">But finding that did little good ,</l>
     <l n="30">He fell to praying as he stood .</l>
     <l n="31">Just as his second prayer begun ,</l>
     <l n="32">Thinks he , By G-d , we 're all undone ,</l>
     <l n="33">If Nestor can n't the Trojans nick</l>
     <l n="34">By some old square-toe 'd slipp'ry trick !</l>
     <l n="35">On which he wrapp 'd his calf'shYpppHeNhide in</l>
     <l n="36">A jacket made of lion 's skin ,</l>
     <l n="37">And then put on a pair of shoes ,</l>
     <l n="38">Such as St. Giles 's statesmen use ,</l>
     <l n="39">With scarce a sole to keep out weather ,</l>
     <l n="40">And forty holes i ’ th ’ upper leather .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="41">His brother likewise found his tripes</l>
     <l n="42">Most sorely twisted with the gripes ,</l>
     <l n="43">Because the very Greeks that came</l>
     <l n="44">To fetch away his light-heel 'd dame</l>
     <l n="45">Were drawn into so bad a lay</l>
     <l n="46">They could not fetch themselves away</l>
     <l n="47">To think they 'd got in such a trap ,</l>
     <l n="48">Disturb 'd the honest Spartan 's nap :</l>
     <l n="49">So out of bed in haste he got ,</l>
     <l n="50">And quickly found the chamber-pot ,</l>
     <l n="51">And whilst he made a little water ,</l>
     <l n="52">Took time to think about the matter ;</l>
     <l n="53">For his schoolmaster , Peter Ashley ,</l>
     <l n="54">Had taught him to do nothing rashly .</l>
     <l n="55">When this important job was done ,</l>
     <l n="56">He put his greasy breeches on ;</l>
     <l n="57">Next button 'd , underneath his chin ,</l>
     <l n="58">A very fierce-look 'd leopard-skin ;</l>
     <l n="59">Then took a broomstick in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="60">And trudg 'd away along the strand</l>
     <l n="61">To call his elder brother up ;</l>
     <l n="62">When , lo ! he found the squabbling tup</l>
     <l n="63">Rear 'd up against his lighter 's side</l>
     <l n="64">Twisting a string , with which he tied</l>
     <l n="65">A rusty hanger to his side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="66">To him the Spartan thus began :</l>
     <l n="67">What makes you put your dudgeon on ?</l>
     <l n="68">D ’ you think of sending out some spy</l>
     <l n="69">This dark and dismal night , to try</l>
     <l n="70">Whether the Trojans watch are keeping ,</l>
     <l n="71">Or pay great idle whelps for sleeping ?</l>
     <l n="72">But who the pox d'ye think will mote</l>
     <l n="73">This dismal night ? Not I , by Jove !</l>
     <l n="74">The hardiest rogue in Fielding 's gang ,</l>
     <l n="75">At such a task an a — e would hang .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="76">The king replies : O Menelaus ,</l>
     <l n="77">I fear these Trojan rogues will pay us</l>
     <l n="78">Both scot and lot for all our tricks ,</l>
     <l n="79">And baste us with their crabtree sticks .</l>
     <l n="80">When cases , like our case , are bad ,</l>
     <l n="81">The best of counsel must be had :</l>
     <l n="82">Therefore , besides both —— and M — n ,</l>
     <l n="83">Above all things secure us N —— n :</l>
     <l n="84">Unless he 's for us , d — n my blood</l>
     <l n="85">If Beelzebub can do us good :</l>
     <l n="86">For if on t'other side you place him ,</l>
     <l n="87">You know the devil cannot face him :</l>
     <l n="88">And Jove , you see , denies us help ,</l>
     <l n="89">But lends it to that Trojan whelp .</l>
     <l n="90">Would ever man believe that one</l>
     <l n="91">Could smoke us all as he has done ?</l>
     <l n="92">But yesterday that blust'ring scrub ,</l>
     <l n="93">What heaps of serjeants did he drub !</l>
     <l n="94">The Sun , before his link went out ,</l>
     <l n="95">Saw how he kick 'd us all about ;</l>
     <l n="96">And yet , like yours and mine , the bitch</l>
     <l n="97">His dam was never thought a witch ;</l>
     <l n="98">Nor is his dad , that queer old cur ,</l>
     <l n="99">A wizard , or a conjurer :</l>
     <l n="100">Yet unborn Greeks , before they 're gotten ,</l>
     <l n="101">Shall wish the rascal dead and rotten ,</l>
     <l n="102">Because his laming all our nation</l>
     <l n="103">Will make a limping generation .</l>
     <l n="104">Do n't stand a moment to consider ,</l>
     <l n="105">But send me bully Ajax hither ;</l>
     <l n="106">Next hasten to Idomeneus ,</l>
     <l n="107">And hurry him away to see us :</l>
     <l n="108">To Nestor I will go before ye ;</l>
     <l n="109">He 's telling some long trimtram story ,</l>
     <l n="110">Such as at any time he 'll make</l>
     <l n="111">To keep the drunken watchmen wake ;</l>
     <l n="112">For that 's his task to-night , and there</l>
     <l n="113">I 'm sure th ’ old cock will show his care ;</l>
     <l n="114">But more especially that entry</l>
     <l n="115">Where Merion and his son stand sentry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="116">Thus spoke the king ; and Menelau</l>
     <l n="117">Replies : Pray , brother , when I go ,</l>
     <l n="118">And all your orders safely carry ,</l>
     <l n="119">Must I return , or must I tarry ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="120">Tarry , be sure , replies the brother ,</l>
     <l n="121">We else shall miss of one another ;</l>
     <l n="122">The night is rather thick than clear ,</l>
     <l n="123">And candles are excessive dear ;</l>
     <l n="124">The very last half-pound we bought</l>
     <l n="125">You fetch 'd yourself , and paid a groat .</l>
     <l n="126">Resides , our lantherns were , you know ,</l>
     <l n="127">All broke to shatters long ago ;</l>
     <l n="128">But we must shift without ‘ em . Now ,</l>
     <l n="129">What I would recommend to you</l>
     <l n="130">Is , all our ragged rogues to cheer ,</l>
     <l n="131">Tell ‘ em what whelps their fathers were :</l>
     <l n="132">For us , since things so bad are got ,</l>
     <l n="133">We e'en must work , or go to pot ;</l>
     <l n="134">Jove has decreed that man must labour ,</l>
     <l n="135">And kings by chance must help their neighbour :</l>
     <l n="136">In former days ‘ twas often done ,</l>
     <l n="137">But now as often let alone :</l>
     <l n="138">Necessity has driv'n me to't ,</l>

     <l n="140">Away then Agamemnon goes :</l>
     <l n="141">But first he clapp 'd within his jaws</l>
     <l n="142">A plug of Hobson 's best tobacco ,</l>
     <l n="143">Then found old Nestor in a cracko ;</l>
     <l n="144">Stretch 'd in his hammock snug he found him ,</l>
     <l n="145">With clubs , oak-sticks , and broomstaves round him ;</l>
     <l n="146">Like an old coachman , who , unable</l>
     <l n="147">To drive , yet loves the smell o ’ th ’ stable ,</l>
     <l n="148">Th ’ old firelock on his guard did keep ,</l>
     <l n="149">A sprite , called Fear , prevented sleep ;</l>
     <l n="150">He lean 'd his head upon his hand .</l>
     <l n="151">And call 'd aloud , Plague on you , stand !</l>
     <l n="152">Say , who the pox are you that keep</l>
     <l n="153">Strolling about whilst folks should sleep ?</l>
     <l n="154">Perhaps you 're some poor hungry thief ,</l>
     <l n="155">Whose nose has smelt my leg of beef :</l>
     <l n="156">If so , you 've nos 'd it mighty soon ,</l>
     <l n="157">‘ Twas only bak 'd this afternoon .</l>
     <l n="158">Or do you hunt some other prey ,</l>
     <l n="159">Or seek some sentry run away ?</l>

     <l n="169">With patience listen then , and judge it :</l>

     <l n="1">The Grecian chief his jacket put on ,</l>
     <l n="2">Though there was not a single button ,</l>
     <l n="3">Either of horn , or metal cast ,</l>
     <l n="4">Remain 'd upo n't , to make it fast .</l>
     <l n="5">Yet , as they could not do without him ,</l>
     <l n="6">He tied it with a cord about him ;</l>
     <l n="7">Not a grand swashy green or red cord ,</l>
     <l n="8">But an old rotten piece of bed-cord ;</l>
     <l n="9">Then don 'd a pair of piss-burnt brogues on ,</l>
     <l n="10">And went to lead his ragged rogues on ;—</l>
     <l n="11">Whilst Hector , ever bold and steady ,</l>
     <l n="12">Soon got his trusty Trojans ready .</l>
     <l n="13">For signal , two celestial strumpets</l>
     <l n="14">Employ their tongues instead of trumpets .</l>
     <l n="15">Jove thunder 'd too , but all the sound</l>
     <l n="16">In their superior noise was drown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="17">For such a din they made at starting ,</l>
     <l n="18">His thunder sounded just like farting .</l>
     <l n="19">And now , whilst Agamemnon mauls ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="20">And with his crab-tree cudgel galls ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="21">Jove call 'd for Iris , to direct her</l>
     <l n="22">To go and caution bully Hector</l>
     <l n="23">To let this Grecian bruiser roam ,</l>
     <l n="24">Till some chance knock should send him home .</l>
     <l n="25">Then Hector makes a woeful rout .</l>
     <l n="26">And kicks the Grecians all about ;</l>
     <l n="27">Whome'er he hit , he surely dropp 'd him ,</l>
     <l n="28">Till Diom . and Ulysses stopp 'd him ;</l>
     <l n="29">Stopp 'd for a while , but ‘ twas not much ,</l>
     <l n="30">For Diomede soon got a touch ,</l>
     <l n="31">Which made the bully limp away ,</l>
     <l n="32">And leave Ulysses in the fray ,</l>
     <l n="33">Who got , unless the poet lies ,</l>
     <l n="34">A broken rib and two black eyes ;</l>
     <l n="35">When Menelau , and Ajax stout ,</l>
     <l n="36">Came apropos to help him out .</l>
     <l n="37">Hector for Ajax went to seek ,</l>
     <l n="38">But found his nob too hard to break .</l>
     <l n="39">Whilst thus each other 's bones they whack</l>
     <l n="40">Paris — had almost lam 'd their quack ;</l>
     <l n="41">Nestor at this , without delay ,</l>
     <l n="42">Drives both himself and quack away .</l>
     <l n="43">Achilles , who was looking out</l>
     <l n="44">To see what work they were about ,</l>
     <l n="45">Sends his companion to inquire</l>
     <l n="46">What made old grizzle-beard retire .</l>
     <l n="47">The threshold he had scarce set foot on ,</l>
     <l n="48">When Nestor seiz 'd him by the button ;</l>
     <l n="49">In that condition did he hold him ,</l>
     <l n="50">Till he had two long stories told him ,</l>
     <l n="51">How cocks and bulls , when he was young ,</l>
     <l n="52">Would fight like devils all day long .</l>
     <l n="53">But still the aim of this old whelp</l>
     <l n="54">Was but to gain Achilles ’ help ,</l>
     <l n="55">Or , if he would not come to blows ,</l>
     <l n="56">To lend Patroclus his thick clothes .</l>
     <l n="57">Patroclus then his best legs put on ,</l>
     <l n="58">Glad he 'd so well releas 'd his button ,</l>
     <l n="59">And met Euryp'lus as he went</l>
     <l n="60">Limping along to reach his tent ;</l>
     <l n="61">Though he just then was running faster</l>
     <l n="62">Than penny-postman , this disaster</l>
     <l n="63">Stay 'd him till he had spread a plaster .</l>

     <l n="1516">My men huzza 'd as I led on ,</l>
     <l n="1517">And made the drunken scoundrels run ,</l>

     <l n="1552">For Doctor Hill 's balsamic honey .</l>
     <l n="1553">But still I drove the rest in flocks</l>
     <l n="1554">As far as the Olinian rocks :</l>

     <l n="14">Both cut and long-tail , black and grey ,</l>
     <l n="15">With all their carts they sent away ;</l>

     <l n="1">Now whilst Patroclus play 'd the quack ,</l>
     <l n="2">The mob each other 's bones did thwack ,</l>

     <l n="5">On Childermas , a luckless day ,</l>
     <l n="6">Their shabby wall of mud , they say ,</l>
     <l n="7">Was rais 'd , which made it soon give way .</l>
     <l n="8">But Homer had a better reason ,</l>
     <l n="9">Why it would hardly last a season :</l>
     <l n="10">They hurried so to get it up ,</l>
     <l n="11">They did not kill a single tup ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or bull , or cow , to give their pack</l>
     <l n="13">Of wooden gods a little snack :</l>
     <l n="14">This made their hungry parsons grumble ,</l>

     <l n="28">They say , if God do n't build the house ,</l>
     <l n="29">Your labour is not worth a louse ;</l>
     <l n="30">But if he builds , we surely then</l>

     <l n="32">His journeymen ! Pray who are they ,</l>
     <l n="33">That we must keep as well as pay ?</l>
     <l n="34">Why , reverend priests , you head of cod !</l>
     <l n="35">They are the journeymen of God :</l>

     <l n="39">They 'll do their duty twenty ways ;</l>
     <l n="40">And , rather than they 'll live in strife ,</l>
     <l n="41">Will do your duty for your wife :</l>

     <l n="49">And all the Grecian rogues forgotten ,</l>
     <l n="50">The neighb'ring streams did all they could</l>
     <l n="51">To undermine these walls of mud :</l>
     <l n="52">Their names were Rhesus and Scamander ,</l>

     <l n="60">And lest their labour should be vain ,</l>
     <l n="61">Jove sent a thund'ring shower of rain ;</l>

     <l n="82">And half the Greeks in woeful fright</l>
     <l n="83">Durst not so much as tarry by't :</l>

     <l n="791">Force in , or yet be quite kept out .</l>
     <l n="792">Thus have I seen within a college</l>
     <l n="793">Two learned owls of little knowledge</l>
     <l n="794">Dispute for hours , and , when they 'd done ,</l>
     <l n="795">Leave off as wise as they begun ;</l>
     <l n="796">Nor would they in the annual round</l>
     <l n="797">Obtain or lose one inch of ground ;</l>
     <l n="798">For , you 'll observe , a learned tup ,</l>
     <l n="799">Though wrong , will never give it up .</l>
     <l n="800">Just such a stubborn bout this was</l>
     <l n="801">To gain or lose the dusty pass .</l>
     <l n="802">Many bold Trojans ribs were smack 'd ,</l>
     <l n="803">And many a Grecian 's noddle crack 'd ;</l>
     <l n="804">Whilst many a nose ran down with blood ,</l>
     <l n="805">And soak 'd these dusty walls of mud .</l>
     <l n="806">Under the Privy-garden wall</l>
     <l n="807">Two cupboard-doors compose a stall ;</l>
     <l n="808">Here you may see old Moggy Briggs</l>
     <l n="809">With caution weigh her rotten figs ;</l>
     <l n="810">No cast o ’ th ’ scale she gives the boys ,</l>
     <l n="811">But sells her ware on equal poise :</l>
     <l n="812">Thus neither Greece nor Troy prevails ,</l>
     <l n="813">But stand like Moggy 's rusty scales ,</l>
     <l n="814">Till bully Hector thund'ring came ,</l>
     <l n="815">And threw his weight upon the beam ;</l>
     <l n="816">Mad as a bull he scales the walls ,</l>
     <l n="817">And for his trusty Trojans calls ;</l>
     <l n="818">Come here , and bring each man a match ,</l>
     <l n="819">And we 'll the lucky moment catch ,</l>
     <l n="820">And then , depend o n't , in a twinkum ,</l>
     <l n="821">We 'll either burn their boats or sink ‘ em .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="822">His voice once heard , these Trojan fighters</l>
     <l n="823">Bring out their link-boys and lamplighters ;</l>
     <l n="824">Not one of all the ragged pack</l>
     <l n="825">But lugg 'd a ladder on his back ,</l>
     <l n="826">Which they against the hedgestakes prop .</l>
     <l n="827">And in a moment reach the top .</l>
     <l n="828">Straight on the walls , the Greeks to fright ,</l>
     <l n="829">Appear 'd to their astonish 'd sight</l>
     <l n="830">A fearful and amazing light :</l>
     <l n="831">Their small remains of courage sinks</l>
     <l n="832">To see such shoals of lamps and links .</l>
     <l n="833">Then Hector snatch 'd up such a stone</l>
     <l n="834">As Brandy Nanny stands upon</l>
     <l n="835">In Paul 's church-yard ; it weigh 'd , I guess ,</l>
     <l n="836">‘ Bout half a ton , or more or less ;</l>
     <l n="837">Ten porters , strong as can be found ,</l>
     <l n="838">Would hardly lift it from the ground</l>
     <l n="839">( In these our days of sloth and ease ,</l>
     <l n="840">When porters work just as they please ):</l>
     <l n="841">Yet this as easily he flung</l>
     <l n="842">As I could do a dried neat 's tongue .</l>
     <l n="843">But Jove himself , you 'll understand ,</l>
     <l n="844">Lent him a sort of helping hand :</l>
     <l n="845">And in these days great Jove could do</l>
     <l n="846">As much as popish saints can now .</l>
     <l n="847">Thus arm 'd , he ran t ’ attack the gates ,</l>
     <l n="848">Though rivetted with iron plates :</l>
     <l n="849">Nestor , who , when the commonweal</l>
     <l n="850">Requir 'd his help , could gravely steal</l>
     <l n="851">( A trade that soldiers quickly learn ) ,</l>
     <l n="852">Had stole ‘ em from a farmer 's barn ,</l>
     <l n="853">Then drove ‘ em thick with heads of nails ,</l>
     <l n="854">Such as you see in country jails ,</l>
     <l n="855">Where nails are driven all about</l>
     <l n="856">To hinder thieves from stealing out :</l>
     <l n="857">These gates , though stronger gates could not</l>
     <l n="858">At such a time of need be got ,</l>
     <l n="859">Were quite unable to resist</l>
