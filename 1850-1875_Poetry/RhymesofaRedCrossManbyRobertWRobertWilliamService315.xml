    <head>Foreword</head>
    <p n="1">I 've tinkered at my bits of rhymes In weary , woeful , waiting times ; In doleful hours of battle-din , Ere yet they brought the wounded in ; Through vigils of the fateful night , In lousy barns by candle-light ; In dug-outs , sagging and aflood , On stretchers stiff and bleared with blood ; By ragged grove , by ruined road , By hearths accurst where Love abode ; By broken altars , blackened shrines I 've tinkered at my bits of rhymes .</p>
    <p n="2">I 've solaced me with scraps of song The desolated ways along : Through sickly fields all shrapnel-sown , And meadows reaped by death alone ; By blazing cross and splintered spire , By headless Virgin in the mire ; By gardens gashed amid their bloom , By gutted grave , by shattered tomb ; Beside the dying and the dead , Where rocket green and rocket red , In trembling pools of poising light , With flowers of flame festoon the night . Ah me ! by what dark ways of wrong I 've cheered my heart with scraps of song .</p>
    <p n="3">So here 's my sheaf of war-won verse , And some is bad , and some is worse . And if at times I curse a bit , You need n't read that part of it ; For through it all like horror runs The red resentment of the guns . And you yourself would mutter when You took the things that once were men , And sped them through that zone of hate To where the dripping surgeons wait ; And wonder too if in God 's sight War ever , ever can be right .</p>
    <p n="4">Yet may it not be , crime and war But effort misdirected are ? And if there 's good in war and crime , There may be in my bits of rhyme , My songs from out the slaughter mill : So take or leave them as you will .</p>

       <l n="2">. . . So I walked among the willows very quietly all night ;</l>
       <l n="3">There was no moon at all , at all ; no timid star alight ;</l>
       <l n="4">There was no light at all , at all ; I wint from tree to tree ,</l>

     </lg>
     <p>It is n't the foe that we fear ; It is n't the bullets that whine ; It is n't the business career Of a shell , or the bust of a mine ; It is n't the snipers who seek To nip our young hopes in the bud : No , it is n't the guns , And it is n't the Huns — It 's the MUD , MUD , MUD .</p>
     <p>It is n't the melee we mind . That often is rather good fun . It is n't the shrapnel we find Obtrusive when rained by the ton ; It is n't the bounce of the bombs That gives us a positive pain : It 's the strafing we get When the weather is wet — It 's the RAIN , RAIN , RAIN .</p>
     <p>It is n't because we lack grit We shrink from the horrors of war . We do n't mind the battle a bit ; In fact that is what we are for ; It is n't the rum-jars and things Make us wish we were back in the fold : It 's the fingers that freeze In the boreal breeze — It 's the COLD , COLD , COLD .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Oh , the rain , the mud , and the cold ,</l>
       <l n="2">The cold , the mud , and the rain ;</l>

       <l n="4">From language that 's rude to refrain .</l>
       <l n="5">With porridgy muck to the knees ,</l>
       <l n="6">With sky that 's a-pouring a flood ,</l>
       <l n="7">Sure the worst of our foes</l>

       <l n="14">And mother 's sitting knitting where her roses climb ,</l>
       <l n="15">And the angelus is calling with a soft , soft chime ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the sea-wind comes caressing , and the light 's a golden blessing ,</l>
       <l n="17">And Yvonne , Yvonne is guessing that it 's milking time .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">Oh it 's Sunday , for she 's wearing of her broidered gown ;</l>
       <l n="19">And she draws the pasture pickets and the cows come down ;</l>
       <l n="20">And their feet are powdered yellow , and their voices honey-mellow ,</l>
       <l n="21">And they bring a scent of clover , and their eyes are brown .</l>
       <l n="22">And Yvonne is dreaming after , but her eyes are blue ;</l>
       <l n="23">And her lips are made for laughter , and her white teeth too ;</l>
       <l n="24">And her mouth is like a cherry , and a dimple mocking merry</l>
       <l n="25">Is lurking in the very cheek she turns to you .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="26">So I walk beside her kindly , and she laughs at me ;</l>
       <l n="27">And I heap her arms with lilac from the lilac tree ;</l>
       <l n="28">And a golden light is welling , and a golden peace is dwelling ,</l>
       <l n="29">And a thousand birds are telling how it 's good to be .</l>
       <l n="30">And what are pouting lips for if they can n't be kissed ?</l>
       <l n="31">And I 've filled her arms with blossom so she can n't resist ;</l>
       <l n="32">And the cows are sadly straying , and her mother must be saying</l>
       <l n="33">That Yvonne is long delaying . . . GOD ! HOW CLOSE THAT MISSED !</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>A nice polite reminder that the Boche are nigh ; That we 're here to fight like devils , and if need-be die ; That from kissing pretty wenches to the frantic firing-benches Of the battered , tattered trenches is a far , far cry . Yet still I 'm sitting dreaming in the glare and grime ; And once again I 'm hearing of them church-bells chime ; And how I wonder whether in the golden summer weather We will fetch the cows together when it 's milking time . . . .

       <l n="5">I guess they 're mostly decent , just the same as most of us .</l>
       <l n="6">I guess they loves their ‘ omes and kids as much as you or me ;</l>
       <l n="7">And just the same as you or me they 'd rather shake than fight ;</l>
       <l n="8">And if we 'd ‘ appened to be born at Berlin-on-the-Spree ,</l>

       <l n="3">‘ E thinks ‘ e 's right ( of course ‘ e ai n't ) but this we both agree ,</l>

     <p>Shiverin ’ up to the sandbags , With a hicicle ‘ stead of a spine , Do n't it seem funny the things you think ‘ Ere in the firin ’ line : ( WHEE ! WHUT ! ZIZ ! ZUT ! LORD ! ‘ OW THE BULLETS WHINE ! ) Hunkerin ’ down when a star-shell Cracks in a sputter of light , You can jaw to yer soul by the sandbags Most any old time o ’ night .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">They talks o ’ England 's glory and a - ‘ oldin ’ of our trade ,</l>
       <l n="2">Of Empire and ‘ igh destiny until we 're fair flim-flammed ;</l>

       <l n="4">Then wot I say is : Empire and ‘ igh destiny be damned !</l>
       <l n="5">There 's only one good cause , Bill , for poor blokes like us to fight :</l>
       <l n="6">That 's self-defence , for ‘ earth and ‘ ome , and them that bears our name ;</l>
       <l n="7">And that 's wot I 'm a-doin ’ by the sandbags ‘ ere to-night . . . .</l>
       <l n="8">But Fritz out there will tell you ‘ e 's a-doin ’ of the same .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Starin ’ over the sandbags , Sick of the ‘ ole damn thing ; Firin ’ to keep meself awake , ‘ Earin ’ the bullets sing . ( HISS ! TWANG ! TSING ! PANG ! SAUCY THE BULLETS SING . ) Dreamin ’ ‘ ere by the sandbags Of a day when war will cease , When ‘ Ans and Fritz and Bill and me Will clink our mugs in fraternity , And the Brotherhood of Labour will be The Brotherhood of Peace .</p>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Oh ye whose hearts are resonant , and ring to War 's romance ,</l>
       <l n="3">Hear ye the story of a boy , a peasant boy of France ;</l>
       <l n="4">A lad uncouth and warped with toil , yet who , when trial came ,</l>
       <l n="5">Could feel within his soul upleap and soar the sacred flame ;</l>
       <l n="6">Could stand upright , and scorn and smite , as only heroes may :</l>
       <l n="7">Oh , harken ! Let me try to tell the tale of Jean Desprez .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">With fire and sword the Teuton horde was ravaging the land ,</l>
       <l n="9">And there was darkness and despair , grim death on every hand ;</l>
       <l n="10">Red fields of slaughter sloping down to ruin 's black abyss ;</l>
       <l n="11">The wolves of war ran evil-fanged , and little did they miss .</l>
       <l n="12">And on they came with fear and flame , to burn and loot and slay ,</l>
       <l n="13">Until they reached the red-roofed croft , the home of Jean Desprez .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">“ Rout out the village , one and all ! ” the Uhlan Captain said .</l>
       <l n="15">“ Behold ! Some hand has fired a shot . My trumpeter is dead .</l>
       <l n="16">Now shall they Prussian vengeance know ; now shall they rue the day ,</l>
       <l n="17">For by this sacred German slain , ten of these dogs shall pay . ”</l>
       <l n="18">They drove the cowering peasants forth , women and babes and men ,</l>
       <l n="19">And from the last , with many a jeer , the Captain chose he ten ;</l>
       <l n="20">Ten simple peasants , bowed with toil ; they stood , they knew not why ,</l>
       <l n="21">Against the grey wall of the church , hearing their children cry ;</l>
       <l n="22">Hearing their wives and mothers wail , with faces dazed they stood .</l>
       <l n="23">A moment only . . . . READY ! FIRE ! They weltered in their blood .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="24">But there was one who gazed unseen , who heard the frenzied cries ,</l>
       <l n="25">Who saw these men in sabots fall before their children 's eyes ;</l>
       <l n="26">A Zouave wounded in a ditch , and knowing death was nigh ,</l>
       <l n="27">He laughed with joy : “ Ah ! here is where I settle ere I die . ”</l>
       <l n="28">He clutched his rifle once again , and long he aimed and well . . . .</l>
       <l n="29">A shot ! Beside his victims ten the Uhlan Captain fell .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="30">They dragged the wounded Zouave out ; their rage was like a flame .</l>
       <l n="31">With bayonets they pinned him down , until their Major came .</l>
       <l n="32">A blonde , full-blooded man he was , and arrogant of eye ;</l>
       <l n="33">He stared to see with shattered skull his favourite Captain lie .</l>
       <l n="34">“ Nay , do not finish him so quick , this foreign swine , ” he cried ;</l>
       <l n="35">“ Go nail him to the big church door : he shall be crucified . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="36">With bayonets through hands and feet they nailed the Zouave there ,</l>
       <l n="37">And there was anguish in his eyes , and horror in his stare ;</l>
       <l n="38">“ Water ! A single drop ! ” he moaned ; but how they jeered at him ,</l>
       <l n="39">And mocked him with an empty cup , and saw his sight grow dim ;</l>
       <l n="40">And as in agony of death with blood his lips were wet ,</l>
       <l n="41">The Prussian Major gaily laughed , and lit a cigarette .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="42">But mid the white-faced villagers who cowered in horror by ,</l>
       <l n="43">Was one who saw the woeful sight , who heard the woeful cry :</l>
       <l n="44">“ Water ! One little drop , I beg ! For love of Christ who died . . . . ”</l>
       <l n="45">It was the little Jean Desprez who turned and stole aside ;</l>
       <l n="46">It was the little bare-foot boy who came with cup abrim</l>
       <l n="47">And walked up to the dying man , and gave the drink to him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="48">A roar of rage ! They seize the boy ; they tear him fast away .</l>
       <l n="49">The Prussian Major swings around ; no longer is he gay .</l>
       <l n="50">His teeth are wolfishly agleam ; his face all dark with spite :</l>
       <l n="51">“ Go , shoot the brat , ” he snarls , “ that dare defy our Prussian might .</l>
       <l n="52">Yet stay ! I have another thought . I 'll kindly be , and spare ;</l>
       <l n="53">Quick ! give the lad a rifle charged , and set him squarely there ,</l>
       <l n="54">And bid him shoot , and shoot to kill . Haste ! Make him understand</l>
       <l n="55">The dying dog he fain would save shall perish by his hand .</l>
       <l n="56">And all his kindred they shall see , and all shall curse his name ,</l>
       <l n="57">Who bought his life at such a cost , the price of death and shame . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="58">They brought the boy , wild-eyed with fear ; they made him understand ;</l>
       <l n="59">They stood him by the dying man , a rifle in his hand .</l>
       <l n="60">“ Make haste ! ” said they ; “ the time is short , and you must kill or die . ”</l>
       <l n="61">The Major puffed his cigarette , amusement in his eye .</l>
       <l n="62">And then the dying Zouave heard , and raised his weary head :</l>
       <l n="63">“ Shoot , son , ‘ twill be the best for both ; shoot swift and straight , ” he said .</l>
       <l n="64">“ Fire first and last , and do not flinch ; for lost to hope am I ;</l>
       <l n="65">And I will murmur : VIVE LA FRANCE ! and bless you ere I die . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="66">Half-blind with blows the boy stood there ; he seemed to swoon and sway ;</l>
       <l n="67">Then in that moment woke the soul of little Jean Desprez .</l>
       <l n="68">He saw the woods go sheening down ; the larks were singing clear ;</l>
       <l n="69">And oh ! the scents and sounds of spring , how sweet they were ! how dear !</l>
       <l n="70">He felt the scent of new-mown hay , a soft breeze fanned his brow ;</l>
       <l n="71">O God ! the paths of peace and toil ! How precious were they now !</l>
       <l n="72">The summer days and summer ways , how bright with hope and bliss !</l>
       <l n="73">The autumn such a dream of gold . . . and all must end in this :</l>
       <l n="74">This shining rifle in his hand , that shambles all around ;</l>
       <l n="75">The Zouave there with dying glare ; the blood upon the ground ;</l>
       <l n="76">The brutal faces round him ringed , the evil eyes aflame ;</l>
       <l n="77">That Prussian bully standing by , as if he watched a game .</l>
       <l n="78">“ Make haste and shoot , ” the Major sneered ; “ a minute more I give ;</l>
       <l n="79">A minute more to kill your friend , if you yourself would live . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="80">They only saw a bare-foot boy , with blanched and twitching face ;</l>
       <l n="81">They did not see within his eyes the glory of his race ;</l>
       <l n="82">The glory of a million men who for fair France have died ,</l>
       <l n="83">The splendour of self-sacrifice that will not be denied .</l>
       <l n="84">Yet . . . he was but a peasant lad , and oh ! but life was sweet . . . .</l>
       <l n="85">“ Your minute 's nearly gone , my lad , ” he heard a voice repeat .</l>
       <l n="86">“ Shoot ! Shoot ! ” the dying Zouave moaned ; “ Shoot ! Shoot ! ” the soldiers said .</l>
       <l n="87">Then Jean Desprez reached out and shot . . . THE PRUSSIAN MAJOR DEAD !</l>

       <l n="3">With scarce a thought beyond the hum-drum round ,</l>
       <l n="4">I did my decent job and earned my pay ;</l>

       <l n="66">Now for the third , and there your job is done ,</l>

       <l n="71">You wonder how it is you 're going still .</l>

       <l n="1">Afternoon Tea</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">As I was saying . . . ( No , thank you ; I never take cream with my tea ;</l>
       <l n="3">Cows were n't allowed in the trenches — got out of the habit , y'see . )</l>
       <l n="4">As I was saying , our Colonel leaped up like a youngster of ten :</l>
       <l n="5">“ Come on , lads ! ” he shouts , “ and we 'll show ‘ em . ”</l>
       <l n="6">And he sprang to the head of the men .</l>
       <l n="7">Then some bally thing seemed to trip him ,</l>
       <l n="8">and he fell on his face with a slam . . . .</l>
       <l n="9">Oh , he died like a true British soldier ,</l>
       <l n="10">and the last word he uttered was “ Damn ! ”</l>
       <l n="11">And hang it ! I loved the old fellow , and something just burst in my brain ,</l>
       <l n="12">And I cared no more for the bullets than I would for a shower of rain .</l>
       <l n="13">‘ Twas an awf'ly funny sensation ( I say , this is jolly nice tea ) ;</l>
       <l n="14">I felt as if something had broken ; by gad ! I was suddenly free .</l>
       <l n="15">Free for a glorified moment , beyond regulations and laws ,</l>
       <l n="16">Free just to wallow in slaughter , as the chap of the Stone Age was .</l>
       <l n="17">So on I went joyously nursing a Berserker rage of my own ,</l>
       <l n="18">And though all my chaps were behind me , feeling most frightf'ly alone ;</l>
       <l n="19">With the bullets and shells ding-donging ,</l>
       <l n="20">and the “ krock ” and the swish of the shrap ;</l>
       <l n="21">And I found myself humming “ Ben Bolt ” . . .</l>
       <l n="22">( Will you pass me the sugar , old chap ?</l>
       <l n="23">Two lumps , please ) . . . . What was I saying ? Oh yes , the jolly old dash ;</l>
       <l n="24">We simply ripped through the barrage , and on with a roar and a crash .</l>
       <l n="25">My fellows — Old Nick could n't stop ‘ em . On , on they went with a yell ,</l>
       <l n="26">Till they tripped on the Boches ’ sand-bags ,— nothing much left to tell :</l>
       <l n="27">A trench so tattered and battered that even a rat could n't live ;</l>
       <l n="28">Some corpses tangled and mangled , wire you could pass through a sieve .</l>
       <l n="29">The jolly old guns had bilked us , cheated us out of our show ,</l>
       <l n="30">And my fellows were simply yearning for a red mix-up with the foe .</l>
       <l n="31">So I shouted to them to follow , and on we went roaring again ,</l>
       <l n="32">Battle-tuned and exultant , on in the leaden rain .</l>
       <l n="33">Then all at once a machine gun barks from a bit of a bank ,</l>
       <l n="34">And our Major roars in a fury : “ We 've got to take it on flank . ”</l>
       <l n="35">He was running like fire to lead us , when down like a stone he comes ,</l>
       <l n="36">As full of “ typewriter ” bullets as a pudding is full of plums .</l>
       <l n="37">So I took his job and we got ‘ em . . . . By gad ! we got ‘ em like rats ;</l>
       <l n="38">Down in a deep shell-crater we fought like Kilkenny cats .</l>
       <l n="39">‘ Twas pleasant just for a moment to be sheltered and out of range ,</l>
       <l n="40">With someone you SAW to go for — it made an agreeable change .</l>
       <l n="41">And the Boches that missed my bullets , my chaps gave a bayonet jolt ,</l>
       <l n="42">And all the time , I remember , I whistled and hummed “ Ben Bolt ” .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="43">Well , that little job was over , so hell for leather we ran ,</l>
       <l n="44">On to the second line trenches ,— that 's where the fun began .</l>
       <l n="45">For though we had strafed ‘ em like fury , there still were some Boches about ,</l>
       <l n="46">And my fellows , teeth set and eyes glaring , like terriers routed ‘ em out .</l>
       <l n="47">Then I stumbled on one of their dug-outs , and I shouted : “ Is anyone there ? ”</l>
       <l n="48">And a voice , “ Yes , one ; but I 'm wounded , ” came faint up the narrow stair ;</l>
       <l n="49">And my man was descending before me , when sudden a cry ! a shot !</l>
       <l n="50">( I say , this cake is delicious . You make it yourself , do you not ? )</l>
       <l n="51">My man ? Oh , they killed the poor devil ; for if there was one there was ten ;</l>
       <l n="52">So after I 'd bombed ‘ em sufficient I went down at the head of my men ,</l>
       <l n="53">And four tried to sneak from a bunk-hole ,</l>
       <l n="54">but we cornered the rotters all right ;</l>
       <l n="55">I 'd rather not go into details , ‘ twas messy that bit of the fight .</l>
       <l n="56">But all of it 's beastly messy ; let 's talk of pleasanter things :</l>
       <l n="57">The skirts that the girls are wearing , ridiculous fluffy things ,</l>
       <l n="58">So short that they show . . . . Oh , hang it ! Well , if I must , I must .</l>
       <l n="59">We cleaned out the second trench line , bomb and bayonet thrust ;</l>
       <l n="60">And on we went to the third one , quite calloused to crumping by now ;</l>
       <l n="61">And some of our fellows who 'd passed us were making a deuce of a row ;</l>
       <l n="62">And my chaps — well , I just could n't hold ‘ em ;</l>
       <l n="63">( It 's strange how it is with gore ;</l>
       <l n="64">In some ways it 's just like whiskey : if you taste it you must have more . )</l>
       <l n="65">Their eyes were like beacons of battle ; by gad , sir ! they COULDN'T be calmed ,</l>
       <l n="66">So I headed ‘ em bang for the bomb-belt , racing like billy-be-damned .</l>
       <l n="67">Oh , it did n't take long to arrive there , those who arrived at all ;</l>
       <l n="68">The machine guns were certainly chronic , the shindy enough to appal .</l>
       <l n="69">Oh yes , I omitted to tell you , I 'd wounds on the chest and the head ,</l>
       <l n="70">And my shirt was torn to a gun-rag , and my face blood-gummy and red .</l>
       <l n="71">I 'm thinking I looked like a madman ; I fancy I felt one too ,</l>
       <l n="72">Half naked and swinging a rifle . . . . God ! what a glorious “ do ” .</l>
       <l n="73">As I sit here in old Piccadilly , sipping my afternoon tea ,</l>
       <l n="74">I see a blind , bullet-chipped devil , and it 's hard to believe that it 's me ;</l>
       <l n="75">I see a wild , war-damaged demon , smashing out left and right ,</l>
       <l n="76">And humming “ Ben Bolt ” rather loudly , and hugely enjoying the fight .</l>
       <l n="77">And as for my men , may God bless ‘ em ! I 've loved ‘ em ever since then :</l>
       <l n="78">They fought like the shining angels ; they 're the pick o ’ the land , my men .</l>
       <l n="79">And the trench was a reeking shambles , not a Boche to be seen alive —</l>
       <l n="80">So I thought ; but on rounding a traverse I came on a covey of five ;</l>
       <l n="81">And four of ‘ em threw up their flippers ,</l>
       <l n="82">but the fifth chap , a sergeant , was game ,</l>
       <l n="83">And though I 'd a bomb and revolver he came at me just the same .</l>
       <l n="84">A sporty thing that , I tell you ; I just could n't blow him to hell ,</l>
       <l n="85">So I swung to the point of his jaw-bone , and down like a ninepin he fell .</l>
       <l n="86">And then when I 'd brought him to reason , he was n't half bad , that Hun ;</l>
       <l n="87">He bandaged my head and my short-rib as well as the Doc could have done .</l>
       <l n="88">So back I went with my Boches , as gay as a two-year-old colt ,</l>
       <l n="89">And it suddenly struck me as rummy , I still was a-humming “ Ben Bolt ” .</l>
       <l n="90">And now , by Jove ! how I 've bored you . You 've just let me babble away ;</l>
       <l n="91">Let 's talk of the things that MATTER — your car or the newest play . . . .</l>
