    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">One Spring day in London , long before the invention of freak verse and Freudism , I was standing in front of the Cafe Royal in Regent Street when there emerged from its portals the most famous young writer of the day , the Poet about whose latest work “ The Book Bills of Narcissus ” all literary London was then talking .</p>
    <p n="2">Richard Le Gallienne was the first real poet I had ever laid eyes upon in the flesh and it seemed to my rapt senses that this frock-coated young god , with the classic profile and the dark curls curving from the impeccable silk “ tile ” that surmounted them as curve the acanthus leaves of a Corinthian capital , could be none other than Anacreon 's self in modern shape .</p>
    <p n="3">I can see Le Gallienne now , as he steps across the sunlit sidewalk and with gesture Mercurian hails the passing Jehu . I can even hear the quick clud of the cab doors as the smartly turning hansome snatches from my view the glass-dimmed face I was not to behold again until years later at the house of a mutual friend in New York .</p>
    <p n="4">In another moment the swiftly moving vehicle was dissolved in the glitter of Regent Street and I fell to musing upon the curious interlacement of parts in this picture puzzle of life .</p>
    <p n="5">Here was a common Cabby , for the time being combining in himself the several functions of guide-book , chattel-mortgage and writ of habeas corpus on the person of the most popular literary idol of the hour and all for the matter of maybe no more than half a crown , including the pourboire !</p>
    <p n="6">Who would not have rejoiced to change places with that cabman ! And how might not Pegasus have envied that cab-horse !</p>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Now after all these years it has come to pass that I am to change places with the cabman .</p>
   <p>Perched aloft in the driver 's seat of the First Person Singular , it is my proud privilege to crack the prefatory whip and start this newest and best Le Gallienne Vehicle upon its course through the garlanded Via Laurea to the Sign of the Golden Sheaf .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Look at it well , Dear People , before it starts , this golden vehicle of</l>
     <l n="2">Richard Le Gallienne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Consider how it is built on the authentic lines of the best</l>
     <l n="4">workmanship , made to last for generations , maybe for ever .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Take note of its springs so perfectly hung that the Muse may ride in</l>
     <l n="6">luxurious ease , unjarred by metrical joltings as befits the Queen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">Mark the mirror smooth surface of the lacquer that only time and</l>
     <l n="8">tireless labour can apply .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Before this Master Coach of Poesy the rattle-jointed Tin Lizzie of Free Verse and the painted jazz wagon of Futurism and the cheap imitation of the Chinese palanquin must turn aside , they have no right of way , these literary road-lice on the garlanded Via Laurea .</p>
   <p>With angry thumb , the traffic cop Time will jerk them back to the side streets and byways where they belong , to make way for the Golden Coach of Richard Le Gallienne .</p>

     <l n="9">Thou hast played — ah ! heart , how long !— past all count were they ,</l>
     <l n="10">Girls of gold and ivory , bosomed deep , all snow ,</l>
     <l n="11">Leopard swift , and velvet loined , bronze for hair , wild clay</l>
     <l n="12">Turning at a touch to flame , tense as a strung bow .</l>

     <l n="15">Thou hast eaten ; peacock 's tongues ,— fed thy carp with slaves ,—</l>
     <l n="16">Nests of Asiatic birds , brought from far Cathay ,</l>
     <l n="17">Umbrian boars , and mullet roes snatched from stormy waves ;</l>
     <l n="18">Half thy father 's lands have gone one strange meal to pay ;</l>
     <l n="19">For a morsel on thy plate ravished sea and shore ;</l>

     <l n="22">Vineyards purpling half a world turned to gold thy throat ,</l>
     <l n="23">Falernian , true Massic , the gods ’ own vintages ,</l>
     <l n="24">Lakes thou hast swallowed deep enough galleys tall to float ;</l>
     <l n="25">Wildness , wonder , wisdom , all , drunkenness divine ,</l>
     <l n="26">All that dreams within the grape , madness too , were thine .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="27">Time it is to go and sleep — draw the curtains close —</l>
     <l n="28">Tender strings shall lull thee still , mellow flutes be blown ,</l>
     <l n="29">Still the spring shall shower down on thy couch the rose ,</l>
     <l n="30">Still the laurels crown thine head , where thou dreamest alone .</l>
     <l n="31">Thou didst play , and thou didst eat , thou hast drunken deep ,</l>
     <l n="32">Time at last it is to go , time it is to sleep .</l>

     <l n="1">A battered swordsman , slashed and scarred ,</l>

   <p>How foulness grows fair with the stern lustration of sleets and snows , And rottenness changes back to the breath and the cheek of the rose , And how gentle the wind that seems wild to each blossom that blows ;</p>
   <p>How the lost is ever found , and the darkness the door of the light , And how soft the caress of the hand that to shape must not fear to smite , And how the dim pearl of the moon is drawn from the gulf of the night ;</p>
   <p>How , when the great tree falls , with its empire of rustling leaves , The earth with a thousand hands its sunlit ruin receives , And out of the wreck of its glory each secret artist weaves</p>
   <p>Splendours anew and arabesques and tints on his swaying loom , Soft as the eyes of April , and black as the brows of doom , And the fires give back in blue-eyed flowers the woodland they consume ;</p>
   <p>How when the streams run dry , the thunder calls on the hills , And the clouds spout silver showers in the laps of the little rills , And each spring brims with the morning star , and each thirsty fountain fills ;</p>
   <p>And how , when the songs seemed ended , and all the music mute , There is always somewhere a secret tune , some string of a hidden lute , Lonely and undismayed that has faith in the flower and the fruit .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">So I learn in the woods — that all things come again ,</l>
     <l n="2">That sorrow turns to joy , and that laughter is born of pain ,</l>
     <l n="3">That the burning gold of June is the gray of December 's rain .</l>

    <head>NOON</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Noon like a naked sword lies on the grass ,</l>
     <l n="2">Heavy with gold , and Time itself doth drowse ;</l>
     <l n="3">The little stream , too indolent to pass ,</l>
     <l n="4">Loiters below the cloudy willow boughs ,</l>
     <l n="5">That build amid the glare a shadowy house ,</l>
     <l n="6">And with a Paradisal freshness brims</l>
     <l n="7">Amid cool-rooted reeds with glossy blade ;</l>
     <l n="8">The antic water-fly above it skims ,</l>
     <l n="9">And cows stand shadow-like in the green shade ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or knee-deep in the grassy glimmer wade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">The earth in golden slumber dreaming lies ,</l>
     <l n="12">Idly abloom , and nothing sings or moves ,</l>
     <l n="13">Nor bird , nor bee ; and even the butterflies ,</l>
     <l n="14">Languid with noon , forget their painted loves ,</l>
     <l n="15">Nor hath the woodland any talk of doves .</l>
     <l n="16">Only at times a little breeze will stir ,</l>
     <l n="17">And send a ripple o'er the sleeping stream ,</l>
     <l n="18">Or run its fingers through the willows ’ hair ,</l>
     <l n="19">And sway the rushes momently agleam —</l>
     <l n="20">Then all fall back again into a dream .</l>

     <l n="1">The beauty of this rainy day ,</l>
     <l n="2">All silver-green and dripping gray ,</l>
     <l n="3">Has stolen quite my heart away</l>

     <l n="11">Shut in behind this shimmering screen</l>

     <l n="13">As in a cloister walled with rain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Safe from intrusions , voices vain ,</l>
     <l n="15">And hurry of invading feet ,</l>
     <l n="16">Inviolate in my retreat :</l>
     <l n="17">Myself , my books , my pipe , my fire —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Or I old letters may con o'er ,</l>
     <l n="20">And dream on faces seen no more ,</l>
     <l n="21">The buried treasure of the years ,</l>
     <l n="22">Too visionary now for tears ;</l>
     <l n="23">Open old cupboards and explore</l>
     <l n="24">Sometimes , for an old sweetheart 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="25">A delicate romantic ache ,</l>
     <l n="26">Sometimes a swifter pang of pain</l>
     <l n="27">To read old tenderness again ,</l>
     <l n="28">As though the ink were scarce yet dry ,</l>
     <l n="29">And She still She and I still I .</l>
     <l n="30">What if I were to write as though</l>
     <l n="31">Her letter came an hour ago !</l>
     <l n="32">An hour ago !— This post-mark says . . .</l>
     <l n="33">But out upon these rainy days !</l>
     <l n="34">Come tie the packet up again ,</l>
     <l n="35">The sun is back — enough of rain .</l>
