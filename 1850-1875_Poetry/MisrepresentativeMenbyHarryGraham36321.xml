     <p>My verses in Your path I lay , And do not deem me indiscreet , If I should say that surely they Could find no haven half so sweet As at Your feet . Unworthy little rhymes are these , Tread tenderly upon them , please ! One single favour do I crave , Which is that You regard my pen As Your devoted humble slave . Most fortunate shall I be then Of mortal men ; For what more happiness ensures Than work in service such as Yours ? Should You be pleased , at any time , To dip into this shallow brook Of simple , unpretentious rhyme , Or chance with fav'ring smile to look Upon my book ; Do n't mention such a fact out loud , Or haply I shall grow too proud !</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>Accept these verses then , I pray , Disarming press and public too , For what can hostile critics say ? What else is left for them to do , Because of You , But view with kindness this collection , Which bears the seal of Your protection ?</docImprint>

    <head>Foreword</head>
    <p n="1">All great biographers possess , Besides a thirst for information , That talent which commands success , I mean of course Imagination ; Combining with excessive Tact A total disregard for Fact .</p>
    <p n="2">Boswell and Froude , and all the rest , With just sufficient grounds to go on , Could only tell the world , at best , What Great Men did , and thought — and so on . But I , of course , can speak to you About the things they did n't do .</p>
    <p n="3">I do n't rely on breadth of mind , On wit or pow'rs of observation ; Carnegie 's libraries I find A fruitful source of inspiration ; The new Encyclopaedia Brit . Has helped me , too , a little bit .</p>
    <p n="4">In any case I cannot fail , With such a range of mental vision , So deep a passion for detail , And such meticulous precision . I pity men like Sidney Lee ; How jealous they must be of me !</p>
    <p n="5">‘ Tis easy work to be exact , ( I have no fear of contradiction ) , Since it has been allowed that Fact Is stranger far than any Fiction ; But what demands the truest wit Is knowing what one should omit .</p>
    <p n="6">Carlyle , for instance , finds no place Among my list of lucubrations ; Because I have no wish to face The righteous wrath of his relations . Whatever feud they have with Froude , No one can say that I was rude .</p>
    <p n="7">This work is written to supply A long-felt want among Beginners ; A handbook where the student 's eye May read the lives of saints and sinners , And learn , without undue expense , The fruits of their experience .</p>
    <p n="8">A book to buy and give away , To fill the youthful with ambition , For even they may hope , some day , To share the Author 's erudition ; So not in vain , nor void of gain , The work of his colossal brain .</p>
