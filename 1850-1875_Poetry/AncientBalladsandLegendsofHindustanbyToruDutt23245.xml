    <docTitle><titlePart>TORU DUTT . INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR . If Toru Dutt were alive , she would still be younger than any recognized European writer , and yet her fame , which is already considerable , has been entirely posthumous . Within the brief space of four years which now divides us from the date of her decease , her genius has been revealed to the world under many phases , and has been recognized throughout France and England . Her name , at least , is no longer unfamiliar in the ear of any well-read man or woman . But at the hour of her death she had published but one book , and that book had found but two reviewers in Europe . One of these , M. André Theuriet , the well-known poet and novelist , gave the “ Sheaf gleaned in French Fields ” adequate praise in the “ Revue des Deux Mondes ; ” but the other , the writer of the present notice , has a melancholy satisfaction in having been a little earlier still in sounding the only note of welcome which reached the dying poetess from England . It was while Professor W. Minto was editor of the “ Examiner , ” that one day in August , 1876 , in the very heart of the dead season for books , I happened to be in the office of that newspaper , and was upbraiding the whole body of publishers for issuing no books worth reviewing . At that moment the postman brought in a thin and sallow packet with a wonderful Indian postmark on it , and containing a most unattractive orange pamphlet of verse , printed at Bhowanipore , and entitled “ A Sheaf gleaned in French Fields , by Toru Dutt . ” This shabby little book of some two hundred pages , without preface or introduction , seemed specially destined by its particular providence to find its way hastily into the waste-paper basket . I remember that Mr. Minto thrust it into my unwilling hands , and said “ There ! see whether you can n't make something of that . ” A hopeless volume it seemed , with its queer type , published at Bhowanipore , printed at the Saptahiksambad Press ! But when at last I took it out of my pocket , what was my surprise and almost rapture to open at such verse as this :—</titlePart></docTitle>

   <p>When poetry is as good as this it does not much matter whether Rouveyre prints it upon Whatman paper , or whether it steals to light in blurred type from some press in Bhowanipore .</p>
   <p>Toru Dutt was the youngest of the three children of a high-caste Hindu couple in Bengal . Her father , who survives them all , the Baboo Govin Chunder Dutt , is himself distinguished among his countrymen for the width of his views and the vigour of his intelligence . His only son , Abju , died in 1865 , at the age of fourteen , and left his two younger sisters to console their parents . Aru , the elder daughter , born in 1854 , was eighteen months senior to Toru , the subject of this memoir , who was born in Calcutta on the 4th of March , 1856 . With the exception of one year 's visit to Bombay , the childhood of these girls was spent in Calcutta , at their father 's garden-house . In a poem now printed for the first time , Toru refers to the scene of her earliest memories , the circling wilderness of foliage , the shining tank with the round leaves of the lilies , the murmuring dusk under the vast branches of the central casuarina-tree . Here , in a mystical retirement more irksome to an European in fancy than to an Oriental in reality , the brain of this wonderful child was moulded . She was pure Hindu , full of the typical qualities of her race and blood , and , as the present volume shows us for the first time , preserving to the last her appreciation of the poetic side of her ancient religion , though faith itself in Vishnu and Siva had been cast aside with childish things and been replaced by a purer faith . Her mother fed her imagination with the old songs and legends of their people , stories which it was the last labour of her life to weave into English verse ; but it would seem that the marvellous faculties of Toru 's mind still slumbered , when , in her thirteenth year , her father decided to take his daughters to Europe to learn English and French . To the end of her days Toru was a better French than English scholar . She loved France best , she knew its literature best , she wrote its language with more perfect elegance . The Dutts arrived in Europe at the close of 1869 , and the girls went to school , for the first and last time , at a French pension . They did not remain there very many months ; their father took them to Italy and England with him , and finally they attended for a short time , but with great zeal and application , the lectures for women at Cambridge . In November , 1873 , they went back again to Bengal , and the four remaining years of Toru 's life were spent in the old garden-house at Calcutta , in a feverish dream of intellectual effort and imaginative production . When we consider what she achieved in these forty-five months of seclusion , it is impossible to wonder that the frail and hectic body succumbed under so excessive a strain .</p>
   <p>She brought with her from Europe a store of knowledge that would have sufficed to make an English or French girl seem learned , but which in her case was simply miraculous . Immediately on her return she began to study Sanskrit with the same intense application which she gave to all her work , and mastering the language with extraordinary swiftness , she plunged into its mysterious literature . But she was born to write , and despairing of an audience in her own language , she began to adopt ours as a medium for her thought . Her first essay , published when she was eighteen , was a monograph , in the “ Bengal Magazine , ” on Leconte de Lisle , a writer with whom she had a sympathy which is very easy to comprehend . The austere poet of “ La Mort de Valmiki ” was , obviously , a figure to whom the poet of “ Sindhu ” must needs be attracted on approaching European literature . This study , which was illustrated by translations into English verse , was followed by another on Joséphin Soulary , in whom she saw more than her maturer judgment might have justified . There is something very interesting and now , alas ! still more pathetic in these sturdy and workmanlike essays in unaided criticism . Still more solitary her work became , in July , 1874 , when her only sister , Aru , died , at the age of twenty . She seems to have been no less amiable than her sister , and if gifted with less originality and a less forcible ambition , to have been finely accomplished . Both sisters were well-trained musicians , with full contralto voices , and Aru had a faculty for design which promised well . The romance of “ Mlle . D'Arvers ” was originally projected for Aru to illustrate , but no page of this book did Aru ever see .</p>
   <p>In 1876 , as we have said , appeared that obscure first volume at Bhowanipore . The “ Sheaf gleaned in French Fields ” is certainly the most imperfect of Toru 's writings , but it is not the least interesting . It is a wonderful mixture of strength and weakness , of genius overriding great obstacles and of talent succumbing to ignorance and inexperience . That it should have been performed at all is so extraordinary that we forget to be surprised at its inequality . The English verse is sometimes exquisite ; at other times the rules of our prosody are absolutely ignored , and it is obvious that the Hindu poetess was chanting to herself a music that is discord in an English ear . The notes are no less curious , and to a stranger no less bewildering . Nothing could be more naïve than the writer 's ignorance at some points , or more startling than her learning at others . On the whole , the attainment of the book was simply astounding . It consisted of a selection of translations from nearly one hundred French poets , chosen by the poetess herself on a principle of her own which gradually dawned upon the careful reader . She eschewed the Classicist writers as though they had never existed . For her André Chenier was the next name in chronological order after Du Bartas . Occasionally she showed a profundity of research that would have done no discredit to Mr. Saintsbury or “ le doux Assellineau . ” She was ready to pronounce an opinion on Napol le Pyrénéan or to detect a plagiarism in Baudelaire . But she thought that Alexander Smith was still alive , and she was curiously vague about the career of Saint Beuve . This inequality of equipment was a thing inevitable to her isolation , and hardly worth recording , except to show how laborious her mind was , and how quick to make the best of small resources .</p>
   <p>We have already seen that the “ Sheaf gleaned in French Fields ” attracted the very minimum of attention in England . In France it was talked about a little more . M. Garcin de Tassy , the famous Orientalist , who scarcely survived Toru by twelve months , spoke of it to Mlle . Clarisse Bader , author of a somewhat remarkable book on the position of women in ancient Indian society . Almost simultaneously this volume fell into the hands of Toru , and she was moved to translate it into English , for the use of Hindus less instructed than herself . In January , 1877 , she accordingly wrote to Mlle . Bader requesting her authorization , and received a prompt and kind reply . On the 18th of March Toru wrote again to this , her solitary correspondent in the world of European literature , and her letter , which has been preserved , shows that she had already descended into the valley of the shadow of death :—</p>
   <p>Ma constitution n'est pas forte ; j'ai contracté une toux opiniâtre , il y a plus de deux ans , qui ne me quitte point . Cependant j'espère mettre la main à l '[ oe ] uvre bientôt . Je ne peux dire , mademoiselle , combien votre affection ,— car vous les aimez , votre livre et votre lettre en témoignent assez ,— pour mes compatriotes et mon pays me touche ; et je suis fière de pouvoir le dire que les héroines de nos grandes épopées sont dignes de tout honneur et de tout amour . Y a-ti-il d'héroine plus touchante , plus aimable que Sîta ? Je ne le crois pas . Quand j'entends ma mère chanter , le soir , les vieux chants de notre pays , je pleure presque toujours . La plainte de Sîta , quand , bannie pour la séconde fois , elle erre dans la vaste forêt , seule , le désespoir et l'effroi dans l'âme , est si pathétique qu'il n'y a personne , je crois , qui puisse l'entendre sans verser des larmes . Je vous envois sous ce pli deux petites traductions du Sanscrit , cette belle langue antique . Malheureusement j'ai été obligée de faire cesser mes traductions de Sanscrit , il y a six mois . Ma santé ne me permet pas de les continuer .</p>
   <p>These simple and pathetic words , in which the dying poetess pours out her heart to the one friend she had , and that one gained too late , seem as touching and as beautiful as any strain of Marceline Valmore 's immortal verse . In English poetry I do not remember anything that exactly parallels their resigned melancholy . Before the month of March was over , Toru had taken to her bed . Unable to write , she continued to read , strewing her sick-room with the latest European books , and entering with interest into the questions raised by the Société Asiatique of Paris in its printed Transactions . On the 30th of July she wrote her last letter to Mlle . Clarisse Bader , and a month later , on the 30th of August , 1877 , at the age of twenty-one years , six months , and twenty-six days , she breathed her last in her father 's house in Maniktollah Street , Calcutta .</p>
   <p>In the first distraction of grief it seemed as though her unequalled promise had been entirely blighted , and as though she would be remembered only by her single book . But as her father examined her papers , one completed work after another revealed itself . First a selection from the sonnets of the Comte de Grammont , translated into English , turned up , and was printed in a Calcutta magazine ; then some fragments of an English story , which were printed in another Calcutta magazine . Much more important , however , than any of these was a complete romance , written in French , being the identical story for which her sister Aru had proposed to make the illustrations . In the meantime Toru was no sooner dead than she began to be famous . In May , 1878 , there appeared a second edition of the “ Sheaf gleaned in French Fields , ” with a touching sketch of her death , by her father ; and in 1879 was published , under the editorial care of Mlle . Clarisse Bader , the romance of “ Le Journal de Mlle . D'Arvers , ” forming a handsome volume of 259 pages . This book , begun , as it appears , before the family returned from Europe , and finished nobody knows when , is an attempt to describe scenes from modern French society , but it is less interesting as an experiment of the fancy , than as a revelation of the mind of a young Hindu woman of genius . The story is simple , clearly told , and interesting ; the studies of character have nothing French about them , but they are full of vigour and originality . The description of the hero is most characteristically Indian .—</p>
   <p>Il est beau en effet . Sa taille est haute , mais quelques-uns la trouveraient mince , sa chevelure noire est bouclée et tombe jusqu'à la nuque ; ses yeux noirs sont profonds et bien fendus , le front est noble ; la lèvre supérieure , couverte par une moustache naissante et noire , est parfaitement modelée ; son menton a quelque chose de sévère ; son teint est d'un blanc presque féminin , ce qui dénote sa haute naissance .</p>
   <p>In this description we seem to recognize some Surya or Soma of Hindu mythology , and the final touch , meaningless as applied to an European , reminds us that in India whiteness of skin has always been a sign of aristocratic birth , from the days when it originally distinguished the conquering Aryas from the indigenous race of the Dasyous .</p>
   <p>As a literary composition “ Mlle . D'Arvers ” deserves high commendation . It deals with the ungovernable passion of two brothers for one placid and beautiful girl , a passion which leads to fratricide and madness . That it is a very melancholy and tragical story is obvious from this brief sketch of its contents , but it is remarkable for coherence and self-restraint no less than for vigour of treatment . Toru Dutt never sinks to melodrama in the course of her extraordinary tale , and the wonder is that she is not more often fantastic and unreal .</p>
   <p>But we believe that the original English poems , which we present to the public for the first time to-day , will be ultimately found to constitute Toru 's chief legacy to posterity . These ballads form the last and most matured of her writings , and were left so far fragmentary at her death that the fourth and fifth in her projected series of nine were not to be discovered in any form among her papers . It is probable that she had not even commenced them . Her father , therefore , to give a certain continuity to the series , has filled up these blanks with two stories from the “ Vishnupurana , ” which originally appeared respectively in the “ Calcutta Review ” and in the “ Bengal Magazine . ” These are interesting , but a little rude in form , and they have not the same peculiar value as the rhymed octo-syllabic ballads . In these last we see Toru no longer attempting vainly , though heroically , to compete with European literature on its own ground , but turning to the legends of her own race and country for inspiration . No modern Oriental has given us so strange an insight into the conscience of the Asiatic as is presented in the stories of “ Prehlad ” and of “ Savitri , ” or so quaint a piece of religious fancy as the ballad of “ Jogadhya Uma . ” The poetess seems in these verses to be chanting to herself those songs of her mother 's race to which she always turned with tears of pleasure . They breathe a Vedic solemnity and simplicity of temper , and are singularly devoid of that littleness and frivolity which seem , if we may judge by a slight experience , to be the bane of modern India .</p>
   <p>As to the merely technical character of these poems , it may be suggested that in spite of much in them that is rough and inchoate , they show that Toru was advancing in her mastery of English verse . Such a stanza as this , selected out of many no less skilful , could hardly be recognized as the work of one by whom the language was a late acquirement :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">What glorious trees ! The sombre saul ,</l>
     <l n="2">On which the eye delights to rest ,—</l>
     <l n="3">The betel-nut , a pillar tall ,</l>
     <l n="4">With feathery branches for a crest ,—</l>
     <l n="5">The light-leaved tamarind spreading wide ,—</l>
     <l n="6">The pale faint-scented bitter neem ,</l>
     <l n="7">The seemul , gorgeous as a bride ,</l>
     <l n="8">With flowers that have the ruby 's gleam .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In other passages , of course , the text reads like a translation from some stirring ballad , and we feel that it gives but a faint and discordant echo of the music welling in Toru 's brain . For it must frankly be confessed that in the brief May-day of her existence she had not time to master our language as Blanco White did , or as Chamisso mastered German . To the end of her days , fluent and graceful as she was , she was not entirely conversant with English , especially with the colloquial turns of modern speech . Often a very fine thought is spoiled for hypercritical ears by the queer turn of expression which she has innocently given to it . These faults are found to a much smaller degree in her miscellaneous poems . Her sonnets , here printed for the first time , seem to me to be of great beauty , and her longer piece entitled “ Our Casuarina Tree , ” needs no apology for its rich and mellifluous numbers .</p>
   <p>It is difficult to exaggerate when we try to estimate what we have lost in the premature death of Toru Dutt . Literature has no honours which need have been beyond the grasp of a girl who at the age of twenty-one , and in languages separated from her own by so deep a chasm , had produced so much of lasting worth . And her courage and fortitude were worthy of her intelligence . Among “ last words ” of celebrated people , that which her father has recorded , “ It is only the physical pain that makes me cry , ” is not the least remarkable , or the least significant of strong character . It was to a native of our island , and to one ten years senior to Toru , to whom it was said , in words more appropriate , surely , to her than to Oldham ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Thy generous fruits , though gathered ere their prime ,</l>
     <l n="2">Still showed a quickness , and maturing time</l>
     <l n="3">But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>That mellow sweetness was all that Toru lacked to perfect her as an English poet , and of no other Oriental who has ever lived can the same be said . When the history of the literature of our country comes to be written , there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile exotic blossom of song .</p>

     <l n="6">PARASARA . Brahman , hear .</l>
     <l n="7">With a mind fixed intently on his gods</l>
     <l n="8">Long reigned in Saligram of ancient fame ,</l>
     <l n="9">The mighty monarch of the wide , wide world .</l>
     <l n="10">Chief of the virtuous , never in his life</l>

     <l n="12">Or any creature sentient . But he left</l>

     <l n="15">And with ascetic rites , privations rude ,</l>

     <l n="17">Perfect dominion on his soul . At morn ,</l>
     <l n="18">Fuel , and flowers , and fruit , and holy grass ,</l>
     <l n="19">He gathered for oblations ; and he passed</l>
     <l n="20">In stern devotions all his other hours ;</l>
     <l n="21">Of the world heedless , and its myriad cares ,</l>

     <l n="23">Once on a time , while living thus , he went</l>

     <l n="25">And his ablutions done , he sat him down</l>
     <l n="26">Upon the shelving bank to muse and pray .</l>
     <l n="27">Thither impelled by thirst a graceful hind ,</l>
     <l n="28">Big with its young , came fearlessly to drink .</l>
     <l n="29">Sudden , while yet she drank , the lion 's roar ,</l>
     <l n="30">Feared by all creatures , like a thunder-clap</l>
     <l n="31">Burst in that solitude from a thicket nigh .</l>
     <l n="32">Startled , the hind leapt up , and from her womb</l>
     <l n="33">Her offspring tumbled in the rushing stream .</l>
     <l n="34">Whelmed by the hissing waves and carried far</l>
     <l n="35">By the strong current swoln by recent rain ,</l>
     <l n="36">The tiny thing still struggled for its life ,</l>
     <l n="37">While its poor mother , in her fright and pain ,</l>
     <l n="38">Fell down upon the bank , and breathed her last .</l>
     <l n="39">Up rose the hermit-monarch at the sight</l>
     <l n="40">Full of keen anguish ; with his pilgrim staff</l>
     <l n="41">He drew the new-born creature from the wave ;</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Twas panting fast , but life was in it still .</l>
     <l n="43">Now , as he saw its luckless mother dead ,</l>
     <l n="44">He would not leave it in the woods alone ,</l>
     <l n="45">But with the tenderest pity brought it home .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="46">There , in his leafy hut , he gave it food ,</l>
     <l n="47">And daily nourished it with patient care ,</l>
     <l n="48">Until it grew in stature and in strength ,</l>
     <l n="49">And to the forest skirts could venture forth</l>
     <l n="50">In search of sustenance . At early morn</l>
     <l n="51">Thenceforth it used to leave the hermitage</l>
     <l n="52">And with the shades of evening come again ,</l>
     <l n="53">And in the little courtyard of the hut</l>
     <l n="54">Lie down in peace , unless the tigers fierce ,</l>
     <l n="55">Prowling about , compelled it to return</l>
     <l n="56">Earlier at noon . But whether near or far ,</l>
     <l n="57">Wandering abroad , or resting in its home ,</l>
     <l n="58">The monarch-hermit 's heart was with it still ,</l>
     <l n="59">Bound by affection 's ties ; nor could he think</l>
     <l n="60">Of anything besides this little hind ,</l>
     <l n="61">His nursling . Though a kingdom he had left ,</l>
     <l n="62">And children , and a host of loving friends ,</l>
     <l n="63">Almost without a tear , the fount of love</l>
     <l n="64">Sprang out anew within his blighted heart ,</l>
     <l n="65">To greet this dumb , weak , helpless foster-child ,</l>
     <l n="66">And so , whene'er it lingered in the wilds ,</l>
     <l n="67">Or at the ‘ customed hour could not return ,</l>
     <l n="68">His thoughts went with it ; “ And alas ! ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="69">“ Who knows , perhaps some lion or some wolf ,</l>
     <l n="70">Or ravenous tiger with relentless jaws</l>

     <l n="73">And variegated . Surely for my joy</l>
     <l n="74">It was created . When will it come back ,</l>
     <l n="75">And rub its budding antlers on my arms</l>
     <l n="76">In token of its love and deep delight</l>
     <l n="77">To see my face ? The shaven stalks of grass ,</l>
     <l n="78">Kusha and kasha , by its new teeth clipped ,</l>

     <l n="32">To be the equal of mine only son</l>

     <l n="1">Three happy children in a darkened room !</l>
     <l n="2">What do they gaze on with wide-open eyes ?</l>
     <l n="3">A dense , dense forest , where no sunbeam pries ,</l>

    <head>THE TREE OF LIFE .</head>
     <l n="1">Broad daylight , with a sense of weariness !</l>
     <l n="2">Mine eyes were closed , but I was not asleep ,</l>
     <l n="3">My hand was in my father 's , and I felt</l>
     <l n="4">His presence near me . Thus we often past</l>
     <l n="5">In silence , hour by hour . What was the need</l>
     <l n="6">Of interchanging words when every thought</l>
     <l n="7">That in our hearts arose , was known to each ,</l>
     <l n="8">And every pulse kept time ? Suddenly there shone</l>
     <l n="9">A strange light , and the scene as sudden changed .</l>
     <l n="10">I was awake :— It was an open plain</l>
     <l n="11">Illimitable ,— stretching , stretching — oh , so far !</l>
     <l n="12">And o'er it that strange light ,— a glorious light</l>
     <l n="13">Like that the stars shed over fields of snow</l>
     <l n="14">In a clear , cloudless , frosty winter night ,</l>
     <l n="15">Only intenser in its brilliance calm .</l>
     <l n="16">And in the midst of that vast plain , I saw ,</l>
     <l n="17">For I was wide awake ,— it was no dream ,</l>
     <l n="18">A tree with spreading branches and with leaves</l>
     <l n="19">Of divers kinds ,— dead silver and live gold ,</l>
     <l n="20">Shimmering in radiance that no words may tell !</l>
     <l n="21">Beside the tree an Angel stood ; he plucked</l>
     <l n="22">A few small sprays , and bound them round my head .</l>
     <l n="23">Oh , the delicious touch of those strange leaves !</l>
     <l n="24">No longer throbbed my brows , no more I felt</l>
     <l n="25">The fever in my limbs — “ And oh , ” I cried ,</l>
     <l n="26">“ Bind too my father 's forehead with these leaves . ”</l>
     <l n="27">One leaf the Angel took and therewith touched</l>
     <l n="28">His forehead , and then gently whispered “ Nay ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">Never , oh never had I seen a face</l>
     <l n="30">More beautiful than that Angel 's , or more full</l>
     <l n="31">Of holy pity and of love divine .</l>
     <l n="32">Wondering I looked awhile ,— then , all at once</l>
     <l n="33">Opened my tear-dimmed eyes — When lo ! the light</l>
     <l n="34">Was gone — the light as of the stars when snow</l>
     <l n="35">Lies deep upon the ground . No more , no more ,</l>
     <l n="36">Was seen the Angel 's face . I only found</l>
     <l n="37">My father watching patient by my bed ,</l>
     <l n="38">And holding in his own , close-prest , my hand .</l>
