   <p>TO THE MEMORY OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT</p>
   <p>PREFATORY NOTE</p>
   <p>An attempt has been made in the present collection to gather together the patriotic poems of America , those which depict feelings as well as those which describe actions , since these latter are as indicative of the temper of the time . It is a collection , for the most part , of old favorites , for Americans have been quick to take to heart a stirring telling of a daring and noble deed ; but these may be found to have gained freshness by a grouping in order . The arrangement is chronological so far as it might be , that the history of America as told by her poets should be set forth . Here and there occur breaks in the story , chiefly because there are fit incidents for song which no poet has fitly sung as yet .</p>
   <p>The poems have been printed scrupulously from the best accessible text , and they have not been tinkered in any way , though some few have been curtailed slightly for the sake of space . In a few cases , where the whole poem has not fallen within the scope of this volume , only a fragment is here given . When this has been done , it is pointed out . Brief notes have been prefixed to many of the poems , making plain the occasion of their origin , and removing any chance obscurity of allusion .</p>
   <p>NEW YORK , November , 1882 .</p>
   <p>In the two score years since this collection was prepared many things have happened , and many poets have been in-spired to celebrate men and moods and deeds . It has been found necessary to omit a few of the less important verses in the earlier edition to make room for the most significant of the lyric commemorations of events almost contemporary , and therefore appealing to us more immediately , and perhaps more poignantly .</p>

   <p>[ sidenote : Dec. 16 , 1773 ] This poem was read in Faneuil Hall , on the Centennial Anniversary of the “ Boston Tea-Party , ” at which a band of men disguised as Indians had quietly emptied into the sea the taxed tea-chests of three British ships .</p>

     <l n="75">A second lamp in the belfry burns !</l>
     <l n="76">A hurry of hoofs in a village street ,</l>

     <l n="33">In the street I heard a thumping ; and I knew it was the stumping</l>

     <l n="38">They were making for the steeple ,— the old soldier and his people ;</l>

     <l n="40">Just across the narrow river — O , so close it made me shiver !—</l>
     <l n="41">Stood a fortress on the hilltop that but yesterday was bare .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Not slow our eyes to find it ; well we knew who stood behind it , Though the earthwork hid them from us , and the stubborn walls were dumb : Here were sister , wife , and mother , looking wild upon each other , And their lips were white with terror as they said , THE HOUR HAS COME !</p>

     <l n="1">The morning slowly wasted , not a morsel had we tasted ,</l>

     <l n="3">deafening thrill ,</l>
     <l n="4">When a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Every woman 's heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure ,</l>

     <l n="9">Like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="10">Through the storm of shells and cannon-shot he walked around</l>

   <p>At length the men have started , with a cheer ( it seemed faint-hearted ) , In their scarlet regimentals , with their knapsacks on their backs , And the reddening , rippling water , as after a sea-fight 's slaughter , Round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">So they crossed to the other border , and again they formed in order ;</l>

    <head>HOW OLD BROWN TOOK HARPER 'S FERRY</head>
    <head>EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN</head>
    <head>[ Sidenote : Oct. 16-Dec. 2 , 1859 ] It was on Sunday , October 16th , that John Brown took the Arsenal at Harper 's Ferry . On the 18th he was captured . On December 2d he was hanged . One year later began the War which caused the abolition of slavery .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">John Brown in Kansas settled , like a steadfast Yankee farmer ,</l>
     <l n="2">Brave and godly , with four sons , all stalwart men of might .</l>
     <l n="3">There he spoke aloud for freedom , and the Borderstrife grew</l>
     <l n="4">warmer ,</l>
     <l n="5">Till the Rangers fired his dwelling , in his absence , in the</l>
     <l n="6">night ;</l>
     <l n="7">And Old Brown</l>
     <l n="8">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="9">Came homeward in the morning — to find his house burned</l>
     <l n="10">down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Then he grasped his trusty rifle and boldly fought for freedom ;</l>
     <l n="12">Smote from border unto border the fierce , invading band ;</l>
     <l n="13">And he and his brave boys vowed — - so might Heaven help and</l>
     <l n="14">speed ‘ em !—</l>
     <l n="15">They would save those grand old prairies from the curse that</l>
     <l n="16">blights the land ;</l>
     <l n="17">And Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="18">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="19">Said , “ Boys , the Lord will aid us ! ” and he shoved his ramrod</l>
     <l n="20">down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">And the Lord did aid these men , and they labored day and</l>
     <l n="22">even ,</l>
     <l n="23">Saving Kansas from its peril ; and their very lives seemed</l>
     <l n="24">charmed ,</l>
     <l n="25">Till the ruffians killed one son , in the blessed light of</l>
     <l n="26">Heaven ,—</l>
     <l n="27">In cold blood the fellows slew him , as he journeyed all unarmed ;</l>
     <l n="28">Then Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="29">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="30">Shed not a tear , but shut his teeth , and frowned a terrible</l>
     <l n="31">frown !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="32">Then they seized another brave boy ,— not amid the heat of</l>
     <l n="33">battle ,</l>
     <l n="34">But in peace , behind his ploughshare ,— and they loaded him</l>
     <l n="35">with chains ,</l>
     <l n="36">And with pikes , before their horses , even as they goad their</l>
     <l n="37">cattle ,</l>
     <l n="38">Drove him cruelly , for their sport , and at last blew out his</l>
     <l n="39">brains ;</l>
     <l n="40">Then Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="41">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="42">Raised his right hand up to Heaven , calling Heaven 's vengeance</l>
     <l n="43">down .</l>
     <l n="44">And he swore a fearful oath , by the name of the Almighty ,</l>
     <l n="45">He would hunt this ravening evil that had scathed and torn</l>
     <l n="46">him so ;</l>
     <l n="47">He would seize it by the vitals ; he would crush it day and</l>
     <l n="48">night ; he</l>
     <l n="49">Would so pursue its footsteps , so return it blow for blow ,</l>
     <l n="50">That Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="51">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="52">Should be a name to swear by , in backwoods or in town !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="53">Then his beard became more grizzled , and his wild blue eye</l>
     <l n="54">grew wilder ,</l>
     <l n="55">And more sharply curved his hawk'shYpppHeNnose , snuffing battle</l>
     <l n="56">from afar ;</l>
     <l n="57">And he and the two boys left , though the Kansas strife waxed</l>
     <l n="58">milder ,</l>
     <l n="59">Grew more sullen , till was over the bloody Border War ,</l>
     <l n="60">And Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="61">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="62">Had gone crazy , as they reckoned by his fearful glare and frown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">So he left the plains of Kansas and their bitter woes behind</l>
     <l n="64">him ,</l>
     <l n="65">Slipt off into Virginia , where the statesmen all are born ,</l>
     <l n="66">Hired a farm by Harper 's Ferry , and no one knew where to</l>
     <l n="67">find him ,</l>
     <l n="68">Or whether he 'd turned parson , or was jacketed and shorn ;</l>
     <l n="69">For Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="70">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="71">Mad as he was , knew texts enough to wear a parson 's</l>
     <l n="72">gown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="73">He bought no ploughs and harrows , spades and shovels , and</l>
     <l n="74">such trifles ;</l>
     <l n="75">But quietly to his rancho there came , by every train ,</l>
     <l n="76">Boxes full of pikes and pistols , and his well-beloved Sharp 's</l>
     <l n="77">rifles ;</l>
     <l n="78">And eighteen other madmen joined their leader there again .</l>
     <l n="79">Says Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="80">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="81">“ Boys , we 've got an army large enough to march and take</l>
     <l n="82">the town ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="83">“ Take the town , and seize the muskets , free the negroes and</l>
     <l n="84">then arm them ;</l>
     <l n="85">Carry the County and the State , ay , and all the potent South .</l>
     <l n="86">On their own heads be the slaughter , if their victims rise to</l>
     <l n="87">harm them —</l>
     <l n="88">These Virginians ! who believed not , nor would heed the</l>
     <l n="89">warning mouth . ”</l>
     <l n="90">Says Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="91">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="92">“ The world shall see a Republic , or my name is not John</l>
     <l n="93">Brown . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="94">‘ T was the sixteenth of October , on the evening of a Sunday :</l>
     <l n="95">“ This good work , ” declared the captain , “ shall be on a holy</l>
     <l n="96">night ! ”</l>
     <l n="97">It was on a Sunday evening , and before the noon of Monday ,</l>
     <l n="98">With two sons , and Captain Stephens , fifteen privates — black</l>

     <l n="100">Captain Brown ,</l>
     <l n="101">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="103">Took the guarded armory-building , and the muskets and the cannon ;</l>

     <l n="105">Scared to death each gallant scion of Virginia they ran on ,</l>
     <l n="106">And before the noon of Monday , I say , the deed was done .</l>
     <l n="107">Mad Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="108">Osawatomie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="109">With his eighteen other crazy men , went in and took the town .</l>

     <l n="110">Very little noise and bluster , little smell of powder made he ;</l>
     <l n="111">It was all done in the midnight , like the Emperor 's</l>

     <l n="113">“ Cut the wires ! Stop the rail-cars ! Hold the streets and</l>

     <l n="115">Then declared the new Republic , with himself for guiding star ,—</l>
     <l n="116">This Old Brown ,</l>
     <l n="117">Osawatomie Brown ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="119">Then was riding and railroading and expressing here and thither ;</l>

     <l n="122">And the Shepherdstown and Winchester Militia hastened whither</l>

     <l n="130">When they learned that nineteen madmen had the marvelous</l>

    <head>KEENAN 'S CHARGE</head>
    <head>GEORGE PARSONS LATHROP</head>
    <head>[ Sidenote : May 2 , 1863 ] During the second day of the battle of Chancellorsville , General Pleasonton was trying to get twenty-two guns into a vital position as Stonewall Jackson made a sudden advance .

     <l n="8">Rose like a greeting hail to death .</l>
     <l n="9">Then forward they sprang , and spurred and clashed ;</l>
     <l n="10">Shouted the officers , crimson-sash 'd ;</l>
     <l n="11">Rode well the men , each brave as his fellow ,</l>
     <l n="12">In their faded coats of the blue and yellow ;</l>
     <l n="13">And above in the air , with an instinct true ,</l>
     <l n="14">Like a bird of war their pennon flew .</l>
     <l n="15">With clank of scabbards and thunder of steeds ,</l>
     <l n="16">And blades that shine like sunlit reeds ,</l>
     <l n="17">And strong brown faces bravely pale</l>
     <l n="18">For fear their proud attempt shall fail ,</l>

     <l n="24">Nor came one back his wounds to tell .</l>
     <l n="25">And full in the midst rose Keenan , tall</l>
     <l n="26">In the gloom , like a martyr awaiting his fall ,</l>
     <l n="27">While the circle-stroke of his sabre , swung</l>

     <l n="42">But they stir not again : they raise no cheer :</l>
     <l n="43">They have ceased . But their glory shall never cease ,</l>
     <l n="44">Nor their light be quenched in the light of peace .</l>
     <l n="45">The rush of their charge is resounding still</l>
     <l n="46">That saved the army at Chancellorsville .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Have you heard the story that gossips tell</l>
     <l n="3">Of Burns of Gettysburg ?— No ? Ah , well ,</l>
     <l n="4">Brief is the glory that hero earns ,</l>
     <l n="5">Briefer the story of poor John Burns :</l>
     <l n="6">He was the fellow who won renown ,—</l>
     <l n="7">The only man who did n't back down</l>
     <l n="8">When the rebels rode through his native town ;</l>
     <l n="9">But held his own in the fight next day ,</l>
     <l n="10">When all his townsfolk ran away .</l>
     <l n="11">That was in July , Sixty-three ,</l>
     <l n="12">The very day that General Lee ,</l>
     <l n="13">Flower of Southern chivalry ,</l>
     <l n="14">Baffled and beaten , backward reeled</l>
     <l n="15">From a stubborn Meade and a barren field .</l>
     <l n="16">I might tell how but the day before</l>
     <l n="17">John Burns stood at his cottage door ,</l>
     <l n="18">Looking down the village street ,</l>
     <l n="19">Where , in the shade of his peaceful vine ,</l>
     <l n="20">He heard the low of his gathered kine ,</l>
     <l n="21">And felt their breath with incense sweet</l>
     <l n="22">Or I might say , when the sunset burned</l>
     <l n="23">The old farm gable , he thought it turned</l>
     <l n="24">The milk that fell like a babbling flood</l>
     <l n="25">Into the milk-pail red as blood !</l>
     <l n="26">Or how he fancied the hum of bees</l>
     <l n="27">Were bullets buzzing among the trees .</l>
     <l n="28">But all such fanciful thoughts as these</l>
     <l n="29">Were strange to a practical man like Burns ,</l>
     <l n="30">Who minded only his own concerns ,</l>
     <l n="31">Troubled no more by fancies fine</l>
     <l n="32">Than one of his calm-eyed , long-tailed kine ,—</l>
     <l n="33">Quite old-fashioned and matter-of-fact ,</l>
     <l n="34">Slow to argue , but quick to act .</l>
     <l n="35">That was the reason , as some folks say ,</l>
     <l n="36">He fought so well on that terrible day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">And it was terrible . On the right</l>
     <l n="38">Raged for hours the heady fight ,</l>
     <l n="39">Thundered the battery 's double bass ,—</l>
     <l n="40">Difficult music for men to face ;</l>
     <l n="41">While on the left — where now the graves</l>
     <l n="42">Undulate like the living waves</l>
     <l n="43">That all that day unceasing swept</l>
     <l n="44">Up to the pits the Rebels kept —</l>
     <l n="45">Round shot ploughed the upland glades ,</l>
     <l n="46">Sown with bullets , reaped with blades ;</l>
     <l n="47">Shattered fences here and there</l>
     <l n="48">Tossed their splinters in the air ;</l>
     <l n="49">The very trees were stripped and bare ;</l>
     <l n="50">The barns that once held yellow grain</l>
     <l n="51">Were heaped with harvests of the slain ;</l>
     <l n="52">The cattle bellowed on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="53">The turkeys screamed with might and main ,</l>
     <l n="54">And brooding barn-fowl left their rest</l>
     <l n="55">With strange shells bursting in each nest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="56">Just where the tide of battle turns ,</l>
     <l n="57">Erect and lonely stood old John Burns .</l>
     <l n="58">How do you think the man was dressed ?</l>
     <l n="59">He wore an ancient long buff vest ,</l>
     <l n="60">Yellow as saffron ,— but his best ,</l>
     <l n="61">And , buttoned over his manly breast ,</l>
     <l n="62">Was a bright blue coat , with a rolling collar ,</l>
     <l n="63">And large gilt buttons ,— size of a dollar ,—</l>
     <l n="64">With tails that the country-folk called “ swaller . ”</l>
     <l n="65">He wore a broad-brimmed , bell-crowned hat ,</l>
     <l n="66">White as the locks on which it sat .</l>
     <l n="67">Never had such a sight been seen</l>
     <l n="68">For forty years on the village green ,</l>
     <l n="69">Since old John Burns was a country beau ,</l>
     <l n="70">And went to the “ quiltings ” long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="71">Close at his elbows all that day ,</l>
     <l n="72">Veterans of the Peninsula ,</l>
     <l n="73">Sunburnt and bearded , charged away ;</l>
     <l n="74">And striplings , downy of lip and chin ,—</l>
     <l n="75">Clerks that the Home Guard mustered in ,—</l>
     <l n="76">Glanced , as they passed , at the hat he wore ,</l>
     <l n="77">Then at the rifle his right hand bore ;</l>
     <l n="78">And hailed him , from out their youthful lore ,</l>
     <l n="79">With scraps of a slangy repertoire :</l>
     <l n="80">“ How are you , White Hat ? Put her through ! ”</l>
     <l n="81">“ Your head 's level ! ” and “ Bully for you ! ”</l>
     <l n="82">Called him “ Daddy , ” — begged he 'd disclose</l>
     <l n="83">The name of the tailor who made his clothes ,</l>
     <l n="84">And what was the value he set on those ;</l>
     <l n="85">While Burns , unmindful of jeer and scoff ,</l>
     <l n="86">Stood there picking the rebels off ,—</l>
     <l n="87">With his long brown rifle and bell-crown hat ,</l>
     <l n="88">And the swallow-tails they were laughing at .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="89">‘ Twas but a moment , for that respect</l>
     <l n="90">Which clothes all courage their voices checked :</l>
     <l n="91">And something the wildest could understand</l>
     <l n="92">Spake in the old man 's strong right hand ,</l>
     <l n="93">And his corded throat , and the lurking frown</l>
     <l n="94">Of his eyebrows under his old bell-crown ;</l>
     <l n="95">Until , as they gazed , there crept an awe</l>
     <l n="96">Through the ranks in whispers , and some men saw ,</l>
     <l n="97">In the antique vestments and long white hair ,</l>
     <l n="98">The Past of the Nation in battle there ;</l>
     <l n="99">And some of the soldiers since declare</l>
     <l n="100">That the gleam of his old white hat afar ,</l>
     <l n="101">Like the crested plume of the brave Navarre ,</l>
     <l n="102">That day was their oriflamme of war .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="103">So raged the battle . You know the rest :</l>
     <l n="104">How the rebels , beaten and backward pressed ,</l>
     <l n="105">Broke at the final charge , and ran .</l>
     <l n="106">At which John Burns — a practical man —</l>
     <l n="107">Shouldered his rifle , unbent his brows ,</l>
     <l n="108">And then went back to his bees and cows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="109">That is the story of old John Burns ;</l>
     <l n="110">This is the moral the reader learns :</l>
     <l n="111">In fighting the battle , the question 's whether</l>
     <l n="112">You 'll show a hat that 's white , or a feather !</l>

     <l n="19">The lords of war are beaten down , your glorious task is done ;</l>
     <l n="20">You fought to make the whole world free , and the victory is won .</l>

     <l n="21">Now it 's home again , and home again , our hearts are turning west ,</l>
     <l n="22">Of all the lands beneath the sun America is best .</l>
     <l n="23">We 're going home to our own folks , beyond the ocean bars ,</l>
     <l n="24">Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars .</l>

     <l n="1">He is known to the sun-white Majesties</l>
     <l n="2">Who stand at the gates of dawn .</l>
     <l n="3">He is known to the cloud-borne company</l>
     <l n="4">Whose souls but late have gone .</l>
     <l n="5">Like wind-flung stars through lattice bars</l>
     <l n="6">They throng to greet their own ,</l>
     <l n="7">With voice of flame they sound his name</l>
     <l n="8">Who died to us unknown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">He is hailed by the time-crowned brotherhood ,</l>
     <l n="10">By the Dauntless of Marathon ,</l>
     <l n="11">By Raymond , Godfrey and Lion Heart</l>
     <l n="12">Whose dreams he carried on .</l>
     <l n="13">His name they call through the heavenly hall</l>
     <l n="14">Unheard by earthly ear ,</l>
     <l n="15">He is claimed by the famed in Arcady</l>
     <l n="16">Who knew no title here .</l>

     <l n="17">Oh faint was the lamp of Sirius</l>
     <l n="18">And dim was the Milky Way .</l>
     <l n="19">Oh far was the floor of Paradise</l>
     <l n="20">From the soil where the soldier lay .</l>
     <l n="21">Oh chill and stark was the crimson dark</l>
     <l n="22">Where huddled men lay deep ;</l>
     <l n="23">His comrades all denied his call —</l>
     <l n="24">Long had they lain in sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Oh strange how the lamp of Sirius</l>
     <l n="26">Drops low to the dazzled eyes ,</l>
     <l n="27">Oh strange how the steel-red battlefields</l>
     <l n="28">Are floors of Paradise .</l>
     <l n="29">Oh strange how the ground with never a sound</l>
     <l n="30">Swings open , tier on tier ,</l>
     <l n="31">And standing there in the shining air</l>
     <l n="32">Are the friends he cherished here .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">They are known to the sun-shod sentinels</l>
     <l n="34">Who circle the morning 's door ,</l>
     <l n="35">They are led by a cloud-bright company</l>
     <l n="36">Through paths unseen before .</l>
     <l n="37">Like blossoms blown , their souls have flown</l>
     <l n="38">Past war and reeking sod ,</l>
     <l n="39">In the book unbound their names are found —</l>
     <l n="40">They are known in the courts of God !</l>
