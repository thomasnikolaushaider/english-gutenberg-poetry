    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">‘ A Lover 's Diary ’ has not the same modest history as ‘ Embers ’ . As far back as 1894 it was given to the public without any apology or excuse , but I have been apologising for it ever since , in one way — without avail . I wished that at least one-fifth of it had not been published ; but my apology was never heard till now as I withdraw from this edition of A Lover 's Diary some twenty-five sonnets representing fully one-fifth of the original edition . As it now stands the faint thread of narrative is more distinct , and redundancy of sentiment and words is modified to some extent at any rate . Such material story as there is , apart from the spiritual history embodied in the sonnets , seems more visible now , and the reader has a clearer revelation of a young , aspiring , candid mind shadowed by stern conventions of thought , dogma , and formula , but breaking loose from the environment which smothered it . The price it pays for the revelation is a hopeless love informed by temptation , but lifted away from ruinous elements by self-renunciation , to end with the inevitable parting , poignant and permanent , a task of the soul finished and the toll of the journey of understanding paid .</p>
    <p n="2">The six sonnets in italics , beginning with ‘ The Bride ’ , and ending with ‘ Annunciation ’ , have nothing to do with the story further than to show two phases of the youth 's mind before it was shaken by speculation , plunged into the sadness of doubt and apprehension , and before it had found the love which was to reveal it to itself , transform the character , and give new impulse and direction to personal force and individual sense . These were written when I was twenty and twenty-one years of age , and the sonnet sequence of ‘ A Lover 's Diary ’ was begun when I was twenty-three . They were continued over seven years in varying quantity . Sometimes two or three were written in a week , and then no more would be written for several weeks or maybe months , and it is clearly to be seen from the text , from the change in style , and above all in the nature of the thought that between ‘ The Darkened Way ’ , which ends one epoch , and ‘ Reunited ’ , which begins another and the last epoch , were intervening years .</p>
    <p n="3">The sonnet which begins the book and particularly that which ends the book have been very widely quoted , and ‘ Envoy ’ has been set to music by more than one celebrated musician . Whatever the monotony of a sonnet sequence ( and it is a form which I should not have chosen if I had been older and wiser ) there has been a continuous , if limited , demand for the little book . As Edmund Clarence Stedman said in a review , it was a book which had to be written . It was an impulse , a vision , and a revealing , and , in his own words in a letter to me , “ It was to be done whether you willed it or no , and there it is a truthful thing of which you shall be glad in spite of what you say . ”</p>
    <p n="4">These last words of the great critic were in response to the sudden repentance and despair I felt after Messrs. Stone and Kimball had published the book in exquisite form with a beautiful frontispiece by Will H. Low . In any case , it is now too late to try and disabuse the minds of those who care for the little piece of artistry , and since 1894 , when it was published , I have matured sufficiently in life 's academy not to be too unduly sensitive either as to the merit or demerit of my work . There is , after all , an unlovable kind of vanity in acute self-criticism — as though it mattered deeply to the world whether one ever wrote anything ; or , having written , as though it mattered to the world enough to stir it in its course by one vibration . The world has drunk deep of wonderful literature , and all that I can do is make a small brew with a little flavour of my own ; but it still could get on very well indeed with the old staple and matured vintages were I never to write at all .</p>
    <p n="5">The King — Whence art thou , sir ?</p>
    <p n="6">Gilfaron — My Lord , I know not well . Indeed , I am a townsman of the world . For once my mother told me that she saw The Angel of the Cross Roads lead me out , And point to every corner of the sky , And say , “ Thy feet shall follow in the trail Of every tribe ; and thou shalt pitch thy tent Wherever thou shalt see a human face Which hath thereon the alphabet of life ; Yea , thou shalt spell it out e'en as a child : And therein wisdom find . ”</p>
    <p n="7">The King — Art thou wise ?</p>
    <p n="8">Gilfaron — Only according to the Signs .</p>
    <p n="9">The King — What signs ?</p>
    <p n="10">Gilfaron — The first — the language of the Garden , sire , When man spoke with the naked searching thought , Unlacquered of the world .</p>
    <p n="11">The King — Speak so forthwith ; come , show us to be wise .</p>
    <p n="12">Gilfaron — The Angel of the Cross Roads to me said : “ And wisdom comes by looking eye to eye , Each seeing his own soul as in a glass ; For ye shall find the Lodges of the Wise , The farthest Camp of the Delightful Fires , By marching two by two , not one by one . ”</p>

       <l n="10">That standeth where Earth 's arches make but one ,</l>
       <l n="11">Where all the banners of her soul were flown ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="12">And trumpeted the legions of the sun .</l>

       <l n="1">A time will come when we again shall rail —</l>
       <l n="2">Not yet , not yet . The flood comes on apace ,</l>
       <l n="3">That deep dividing river , and her face</l>
       <l n="4">Grows dimmer as it widens — pale , so pale .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Have we not railed and laughed these many days ,</l>
       <l n="6">Mummers before the lights ? Dear fool , your hand</l>
       <l n="7">Upon your lips — Oh let us once be grand ,</l>
       <l n="8">Grand as we were when treading royal ways .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">Lo , there she moves beyond the river . Gone —</l>
       <l n="10">Gone is the sun-lo , starlight in her eyes .</l>
       <l n="11">See , how she standeth silent and alone —</l>

       <l n="12">Oh , hush ! let us not vex her with our cries .</l>

       <l n="1">When you and I have played the little hour ,</l>

       <l n="12">No words . But as the proud wind fills the sail ,</l>
