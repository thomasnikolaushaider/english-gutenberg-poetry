    <docTitle><titlePart>“ Hello , Soldier ! ” Khaki Verse by Edward Dyson</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Many of these verse were originally printed in the “ Bulletin , ” others in “ Punch , ” “ The Leader ” and<settlement>Melbourne</settlement>“ Herald . ” Some few are now published for the first time .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>The paper famine leaving me no option but to print on peculiar paper , not wholly prohibitive or to defer the publication of my verses for an unknown period , the natural longing of a parent to parade his “ well be - gotten ” prevails . If my book is unusual and bizarre from a craftman 's point of view , I plead the unusual times and extraordinary conditions . Of these times and conditions . I hope “ Hello Soldier ” is in some measure characteriastic .— Edward Dyson . AUSTRALIA . AUSTRALIA , my native land , A stirring whisper in your ear — ‘ Tis time for you to understand Your rating now is A1 , dear . You 've done some rousing things of late . That lift you from the simple state In which you chose to vegetate . The persons so superior , Whose patronage no more endures , Now have to fire a salvo for The glory that is fairly yours . At length you need no sort of crutch , You stand alone , you 're voted “ much ” — Get busy and behave as such . No man from Oskosh , or from Hull , Or any other chosen place Can rise with a distended skull , And cast aspersions in your face . You 're given all the world to know Your proper standing as a foe , And hats are off , and rightly so . You furnished heroes for the fray , Your sterling merit 's widely blown To all men 's satisfaction say , Now have you proved it to your own ? Now have you strength to stand and shine In your own light and say , “ Divine The thing is that I do . It 's mine ! ” The cannon 's stroke throws customs down The black and bottomless abyss , And quaking are the gilded crown And palsied feet of prejudice . The guns have killed , but it is true They bring to life things good and new . God grant they have awakened you ! My ears are greedy for the toast Of confidence before our guest , The loyal song , the manly boast Your splendid faith to manifest . In works of art and livelihood Shirk not the creed , “ What 's ours is good , ” Dread not to have it understood . Australia , lift your royal brow , And have the courage of our pride , Audacity becomes you now , Be splendidly self-satisfied , No land from lowliness and dearth Has won to eminence on earth That was not conscious of its worth .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <head>BILLY KHAKI</head>
     <p>MARCHING somewhat out of order when the band is cock-a-hoop , There 's a lilting kind of magic in the swagger of the troop , Swinging all aboard the steamer with her nose toward the sea . What is calling , Billy Khaki , that you 're foot - ing it so free ?</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Though his lines are none too level ,</l>
       <l n="2">And he lacks a bit of style .</l>
       <l n="3">And he 's swanking like the devil</l>
       <l n="4">Where the women wave and smile ,</l>
       <l n="5">He will answer with a rifle</l>
       <l n="6">Trim and true from stock to bore ,</l>
       <l n="7">Where the comrades crouch and stifle</l>
       <l n="8">In the reeking pit of war .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>What is calling , Billy Khaki ? There is thunder down the sky , And the merry magpie bugle splits the morn - ing with its cry , While your feet are beating rhythms up the dusty hills and down , And the drums are all a-talking in the hollow of the town .</p>
     <p>Billy Khaki , is't the splendor of the song the kiddies sing , Or the whipping of the flags aloft that sets your heart a-swing ? Is't the cheering like a paean of the toss - ing , teeming crowds , Or the boom of distant cannon flatly bumping on the clouds ?</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">What 's calling , calling , Billy ? ‘ Tis the rattle</l>
       <l n="2">far away</l>
       <l n="3">Of the cavalry at gallop and artillery in play ;</l>
       <l n="4">‘ Tis the great gun 's fierce concussion , and the</l>
       <l n="5">smell of seven hells</l>
       <l n="6">When the long ranks go to pieces in the</l>
       <l n="7">sneezing of the shells .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">But your eyes are laughing , Billy , and a</l>
       <l n="9">ribald song you sing ,</l>
       <l n="10">While the old men sit and tell us war it is a</l>
       <l n="11">ghastly thing ,</l>
       <l n="12">When the swift machines are busy and the</l>
       <l n="13">grim , squat fortress nocks</l>
       <l n="14">At your bolts as vain as eggs of gulls that spatter on the rocks .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>When the horses sweep upon you to complete a sudden rout , Or in fire and smoke and fury some brave regiment goes out , War is cruel , Bill , and ugly . But full well you know the rest , Yet your heart is for the battle , and your face is to the west .</p>
     <p>For if war is beastly , Billy , you can picture something worse — There 's the wrecking of an empire , and its broken people 's curse ; There are nations reft of freedom , and of hope and kindly mirth , And the shadow of an evil black upon the bitter earth .</p>
     <p>So we know what 's calling , Billy . ‘ Tis the spirit of our race , And its stir is in your pulses , and its light is on your face As you march with clipping boot-heels through the piping , howling town To uphold the land we live in , and to pull a tyrant down .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Thou his lines are none too level ,</l>
       <l n="2">And he 's not a whale for style ,</l>
       <l n="3">And he 's swanking like the devil</l>
       <l n="4">When the women wave and smile</l>
       <l n="5">He will answer with a rifle ,</l>
       <l n="6">Trim and true from stuck to bore ,</l>
       <l n="7">When the comrades sit and stifle</l>
       <l n="8">In the smoking pit of war .</l>

       <l n="1">I HEARD this day , as I may no more ,</l>
       <l n="2">The world 's heart throb at my workshop door .</l>
       <l n="3">The sun was keen , and the day was still ;</l>
       <l n="4">The township drowsed in , a haze of heat .</l>
       <l n="5">A stir far off on the sleepy hill ,</l>
       <l n="6">The measured beat of their buoyant feet ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the lilt and thrum</l>
       <l n="8">Of a little drum ,</l>
       <l n="9">The song they sang in a cadence low ,</l>
       <l n="10">The piping note of a piccolo .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">The township woke , and the doors flew wide ;</l>
       <l n="12">The women trotted their boys beside .</l>
       <l n="13">Across the bridge on a single heel</l>
       <l n="14">The soldiers came in a golden glow ,</l>
       <l n="15">With throb of song and the chink of steel ,</l>
       <l n="16">The gallant crow of the piccolo .</l>
       <l n="17">Good and brown they were ,</l>
       <l n="18">And their arms swung bare .</l>
       <l n="19">Their fine young faces revived in me</l>
       <l n="20">A boyhood 's vision of chivalry .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="21">The lean , hard regiment tramping down ,</l>
       <l n="22">Bushies , miners and boys from town .</l>
       <l n="23">From ‘ mid the watchers the road along</l>
       <l n="24">One fell in line with the khaki men .</l>
       <l n="25">He took the stride , and he caught their song ,</l>
       <l n="26">And Steve went then , and Meneer , and Ben ,</l>
       <l n="27">Long Dave McCree ,</l>
       <l n="28">And the Weavers three ,</l>
       <l n="29">All whisked away by the “ Come ! Come ! Come ! ”</l>
       <l n="30">The lusty surge of the vaunting drum .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="31">I swore a prayer for each soldier lad .</l>
       <l n="32">He was the son that might have had ;</l>
       <l n="33">The tall , bold boy who was never mine ,</l>
       <l n="34">All brave with dust that the eyes laughed through ,</l>
       <l n="35">His shoulders square , and his chin in line ,</l>
       <l n="36">Was marching too with the gallant few .</l>
       <l n="37">Passed the muffled beat</l>
       <l n="38">Of their swanking feet ,</l>
       <l n="39">The swell of drum , the exulting crow ,</l>
       <l n="40">The wild-bird note of the piccolo .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="41">They dipped away in the listless trees ;</l>

       <l n="44">But more than mother or man wept I</l>
       <l n="45">Who had no son in the world to send .</l>
       <l n="46">The hour lagged by , and drifting high</l>
       <l n="47">Came the fitful hum</l>
       <l n="48">Of the little drum ,</l>
       <l n="49">And faint , but still with an ardent flow ,</l>
       <l n="50">The pibroch , call of the piccolo .</l>

      <head>MARSHAL NEIGH , V. C .</head>
       <l n="1">HE came from tumbled country past the</l>
       <l n="2">humps of Buffalo</l>
       <l n="3">Where the snow sits on the mountain ‘ n ’ the</l>
       <l n="4">Summer aches below .</l>
       <l n="5">He 'd a silly name like Archie . Squattin ’</l>
       <l n="6">sullen on the ship ,</l>
       <l n="7">He knew nex ’ to holy nothin ’ through the gor-</l>
       <l n="8">forsaken trip .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>No thoughts he had of women , no refreshin ’ talk of beer ; If he 'd battled , loved , or suffered vital facts did not appear ; But the parsons and the poets could n't teach him to discourse When it come to pokin ’ guyver at a pore , deluded horse .</p>
     <p>If nags got sour ‘ n ’ kicked agin the rules of things at sea , Artie argued matters with ‘ em , ‘ n ’ he 'd kid ‘ em up a tree . “ Here 's a pony got hystericks . Pipe the word for Privit Rowe , ” The Sargint yapped , ‘ n ’ all the ship came cluckin ’ to the show .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">He 'd chat him confidential , ‘ n ’ he 'd pet ‘ n ’</l>
       <l n="2">paw the moke ;</l>
       <l n="3">He 'd tickle him , ‘ n ’ flatter him , ‘ n ’ try him</l>
       <l n="4">with a joke ;</l>
       <l n="5">‘ N ’ presently that neddy sobers up , ‘ n ’ sez</l>
       <l n="6">“ Ive course ,</l>
       <l n="7">Since you puts it that way , cobber , I will be</l>
       <l n="8">a better horse . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>There was one pertickler whaler , known aboard ez Marshal Neigh , Whose monkey tricks with Privit Rowe was better than a play . He 'd done stunts in someone 's circus , ‘ n ’ he loved a merry bout , Whirlin ’ in to bust his boiler , or to kick the bottom out .</p>
     <p>Rowe he sez : “ Well , there 's an idjit ! Oh , yes , let her whiz , you beauty ! Where 's yer ‘ orse sense , little feller ? Where 's yer bloomin ’ sense iv duty ? Well , you orter serve yer country ! ” Then there 'd come a painful hush , ‘ N ’ that nag would drop his head-piece , ‘ n ’ , so ‘ elp me cat , he 'd blush .</p>
     <p>We was heaped ashore be Suez , rifle , horse , ‘ n ’ man , ‘ n ’ tent , Where the land is sand , the water , ‘ n ’ the gory firmament . We had intervals iv longin ’ , we had sweaty spells of work In the ash-pit iv Gehenner , dumbly waitin ’ fer the Turk .</p>
     <p>We goes driftin ’ on the desert , nothin ’ doin ’ , nothin ’ said , Till we get to think we 're nowhere , ‘ n ’ arf fancy we are dead , ‘ N ’ the only ‘ uman interest on the red hori - zon 's brim Is Marshal Neigh 's queer faney fer the lad that straddles him .</p>
     <p>Plain-livin 's nearly , bored us stiff . The Major calls on Rowe To devise an entertainment . What his charger does n't know Is n't in the regulations . Him ‘ n ’ Rowe is brothers met , ‘ N ’ that horse 's sense iv humor is the oddest fancy yet .</p>
     <p>But the Turk arrives one mornin ’ on the outer edge iv space . From back iv things his guns is floppin ’ kegs about the place , ‘ N ’ Privit Artie Rowe along with others iv the force Goes pig-rootin ’ inter battle , holdin ’ converse with his horse .</p>
     <p>Little Abdul 's quite a fighter , ‘ n ’ he mixes it with skill ; But the Anzacs have him snouted ,, ‘ n ’ , oh , ma , he 's feelin ’ ill . They wake the all-fired desert , ‘ n ’ the land for ever dead Is alive ‘ n ’ fairly creepin ’ , and the skies are droppin ’ lead .</p>

       <l n="2">gaudy hunts begin .</l>

       <l n="7">Is Artie from Molinga on his neddy , Marshal</l>
       <l n="8">Neigh .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>We 're pursuin ’ sundry camels turkey-trottin ’ anyhow With the carriage iv an emu ‘ n ’ the action iv a cow , When a sand dune busts , ‘ n ’ belches arf a million iv the foe . They uncork a blanky batt'ry , ‘ n ’ it 's , Allah , let her go !</p>
     <p>We 're not stayin ’ dinner , thank you . Lie along yer horse ‘ n ’ yell , While the bullets pip yer britches ‘ n ’ you sniff the flue of Hell . Here it is that Artie takes it good ‘ n ’ solid in the crust , He dives from out the saddle , ‘ n ’ is swallered in the dust .</p>

     <p>Worked loose from Caddy 's bunch , we went it gay until we found We 'd took to ‘ arf the ragin ’ German Hempire on our own . Then down we went so ‘ umble , with our noses in the ground , Takin ’ cover in the rubble . If a German head was shown It was fare-the-well to Herman with a bullet through the bone .</p>
     <p>We slogged the cows remorseless , ‘ n ’ they laid for us a treat . We held that stinkin ’ cellar , though , ‘ n ’ when the day was done Son pussied on his bingie where a Maxie trim ‘ n ’ neat Had spit out loaded lightnin ’ , and he slugged a tubby Hun , Then choked a Fritzie with his dukes , ‘ n ’ pinched the sooner 's gun !</p>
     <p>We rigged her on her knuckle-bones . Cri ’ , how she lapped ‘ em up ! We hosed ‘ em out with livin ’ lead . That was the second day . Me left eye I 'd ‘ ave give for jest a bubble in a cup , Three fingers I 'd ‘ ave parted for a bone I 've flung away ; But the butcher was n't callin ’ , ‘ n ’ the fountain did n't play .</p>

       <l n="7">But Son he claws his stubble . Sez — he :</l>
       <l n="8">“ Hold a brace of ticks . ”</l>
       <l n="9">Then “ Yow ! ” he pipes ‘ n ’ “ Strewth ! ” he</l>

     <p>There 's more than ‘ arf a million spilt where somethin ’ hit a pub ; We creeps among ‘ n ’ sorts ‘ em , stack afore , ‘ n ’ stack behind ; The Hun is comin ’ at us with his napper like a tub — You could n't ‘ ope to miss it , pickled , par - alysed , ‘ n ’ blind . Sez Sonny : “ Lay ‘ em open ! Give ‘ em blotches on the rind ! ”</p>
     <p>Then bricks was flyin ’ in the wind . Mine dinted Otto 's chin ; Ole Nosey got his brother , which he never more will roam . When Ulrich stopped a Port bookay he rolled his alley in . Their fire was somethin ’ fierce . Poor Son was blowin ’ blood ‘ n ’ foam , “ Fill up , ” he coughs , “ ‘ n ’ plug ‘ em ! S'elp me Gord , we 're goin ’ ‘ ome ! ”</p>
     <p>With bricks we drove right at ‘ em ‘ n ’ we wanged ‘ em best we could . ‘ Twas either bed ‘ n ’ breakfast or a scribble and a wreath . Haynes bust a Prussian 's almond , took the bay'net where he stood , Then heaved his last ‘ arf-Brunswick , split the demon 's grinnin ’ teeth , And Son went down in glory , with a German underneath !</p>
     <p>We 'd started out with gibbers in our clobber and our ‘ ats . They gave us floatin ’ lead enough to stop an army cor . We yelled like fiends , ‘ n ’ countered with a lovely flight of bats , Then rushed in close formation , heavin ’ cot - tages , n ’ tore Through blinded , bleedin ’ Bosches , ‘ n ’ lor love yeh , it was war !</p>
     <p>We came peltin ’ , headfirst , ‘ elpless , in a drain among a lot Of dirty , damned old Tommies ( Gord ! The best that ever blew ! ) Eight left of us , all punctured , each man holdin ’ what he 'd got . Me wild , a rat hole in me lung , but in me mauley , too , A bull-nosed brick with whiskers where no whiskers ever grew .</p>
     <p>There 's nothin ’ doin ’ now . I wear me blan - kets like a toff . The way this fat nurse pets me , strewth , it 's well to be so sick , A-dreamin ’ of our contract ‘ n ’ the way we pulled it off . I reckon Haig is phonin ’ Hughes : “ Hullo , there , Billy . Quick — A dozen of the pushes and a thousan ’ tons of brick ! ”</p>

      <head>A MILE-LONG panto dragon ploddin ’ ‘ opeless all the day , Stuffed out with kits , ‘ n ’ spiked with rifles , steamin ’ in its sweat , A-heavin ’ down the misty road , club-footed through the clay , By waggons bogged ‘ n ’ buckin ’ guns , the wildest welter yet , Like ‘ arf creation 's tenants shiftin ’ early in the wet .</head>
       <l n="1">We 're marchin ’ out , we dunno where , to meet</l>
       <l n="2">we dunno who ;</l>
       <l n="3">But here we lights eventual , ‘ n ’ sighs ‘ n ’</l>

       <l n="6">Mollynoo !</l>
       <l n="7">A copper of the Port he was , when ‘ istory</l>
       <l n="8">was writ .</l>

       <l n="10">me , this is It . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>A shine John . Hop is Mollynoo . A mix-up with the push Is all his joy . One evenin ’ when his baton 's flyin ’ free I takes a baby brick , ‘ n ’ drives it hard agin the cush , ‘ N ’ Privit Mick is scattered out fer all the world to see , But not afore indelible he 's put his mark on me .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">I got the signs Masonic all inlaid along me</l>
       <l n="2">lug</l>
       <l n="3">Where Molly , P. C ., swiped me in them</l>
       <l n="4">‘ appy , careless days .</l>
       <l n="5">He 's sargin ’ now , a vet'ran ; I 'm a newchum</l>
       <l n="6">and a mug ,</l>
       <l n="7">‘ N ’ when he sorter fixes me there 's some-</l>
       <l n="8">thin ’ in his gaze</l>
       <l n="9">That 's pensive like . “ Move on ! ” sez he .</l>
       <l n="10">“ Keep movin ’ there ! ” he says .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>If after this I dreams of scraps promiscuous and crool , The mills in Butcher 's Alley when the watch is on the wine , Those nights he raided Wylie 's shed to break the two-up school , I takes a screw at Molly . With a grin that ai n't divine He 's toyin ’ with a scar of old I reckernise as mine .</p>
     <p>‘ N ’ so I 'm layin ’ for it , ‘ n ’ I 'm wonderin ’ how ‘ n ’ what . We 're signed on with the Germans , ‘ n ’ there ai n't a vacant date ; But sure it 's comin ’ to me , ‘ n ’ it 's comin ’ ‘ ard ‘ n ’ ‘ ot . Me lurk is patient waitin ’ , but I 'm trim - min ’ while I wait A brick to jab or swing with , in a willin ’ tatertate .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Oh , judge me wonder ! There 's a scrim that</l>
       <l n="2">follers on a raid .</l>
       <l n="3">I 'm roughin ’ it all-in with Hans . He sock</l>
       <l n="4">me such a bat</l>
       <l n="5">I slides on somethin ’ narsty , ‘ n ’ me little grave</l>
       <l n="6">is made ;</l>
       <l n="7">But Molly butts my Hun , ‘ n ’ leaves no face</l>
       <l n="8">beneath his hat ,</l>
       <l n="9">‘ N ’ , “ ‘ Scuse me , Mister Herr , ” sez he , “ I have a lien on that ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>He helps me under cover , ‘ n ’ he ‘ ands me somethin ’ wet ( I 've got a lick or two that leaves me feelin ’ pretty sick ) . “ Lor love yeh , ole John Hop , ” sez I , “ yiv buried me in debt . ” “ Do n't minton ut at all , ” he sez , ‘ n ’ eyes me arf-a-tick . ‘ N ’ back there in the trench I sits , ‘ n ’ trims another brick .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Tis all this how a month or more ; then</l>
       <l n="2">Mollynoo sez he :</l>
       <l n="3">“ Come aisy , Jumm , yeh loafer , little hell ‘ n ’</l>

       <l n="10">Sargin ’ Mollynoo ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I take , with knife ‘ n ’ pistol , arf a brick to line me shirt . We creeps a thousan ’ yards or so to jigger up a gun Which seven Huns is workin ’ on the Irish like a squirt . We gets across them , me ‘ n ’ him . I pots the extra one ; Mick chokes his third in comfort , ‘ n ’ , be'old , the thing is done !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">He stands above me , rakin ’ sweat from off his</l>
       <l n="2">gleamin ’ nut .</l>
       <l n="3">“ Me dipper 's leakin ’ , Mick , ” sez I ; “ me</l>
       <l n="4">leg is bit in two . ”</l>
       <l n="5">Sez he : “ Bleed there in comfort , I 'm for</l>
       <l n="6">bringin ’ help , ye scut . ”</l>
       <l n="7">He 's back in twenty minutes , with a dillied</l>
       <l n="8">German crew .</l>
       <l n="9">“ Three 'll carry in the gun , ” sez he , “ the</l>
       <l n="10">rest will carry you . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I dunno how he got ‘ em , but he made them barrer me . They lugged the gun before him , ‘ n ’ he yarded them like geese . Then Mickie s'lutes the Major . “ They 're in custody , ” sez he , “ Fer conduc ’ calculated to provoke a breach iv peace , A-tearin ’ iv me uniform , ‘ n ’ ‘ saultin ’ the po-lice . ”</p>
     <p>Then down he dumped . His wounds would make a ‘ arf a column list . When hack to front I chucks me bricks ‘ n ’ smiles the best I can . He grins at me : “ Yer right , ” sez he , “ Hold out yer bla ’ - guard fist , I could n't fight yeh , blarst yeh , if yeh dinted in me pan . This messin ’ round wid Germans makes a chicken iv a man . ”</p>

     <p>WEEPIN ’ WILLIE .</p>
     <p>WHEY our trooper hit wide water every heart was yearin ’ back To the little ‘ ouse at Coogee or a hut at Bar - renjack . She was ‘ ookin ’ up to spike the stars , or rootin ’ in the wave , An ’ me liver turned a hand spring with each buck the beggar gave . Then we pulls a sick ‘ n ’ silly smile ‘ n ’ tips a saucy lid , Crackin ’ hardy . Willie did n't . Willie snivelled like a kid .</p>
     <p>At Gallip ’ the steamer dumped us , ‘ n ’ we got right down to work , Whoopin ’ up the hill splendacious , playin ’ tiggie with the Turk . When the stinkin ’ Abdul hit us we curled down upon a stone , ‘ N ’ we yelled for greater glory , crackin ’ ‘ ardy on our own . Not so Willie . He was cursin ’ , cold ez death ‘ n ’ grey ez steel , ‘ N ’ the smallest thing that busted made the little blighter squeal .</p>
     <p>In the bitter day 's that follered , spillin ’ life be - side the sea , We would fake a spry expression for the things that had to be , Always dressin ’ up the winder , crackin ’ ‘ ardy though we felt Fearful creepy in the whiskers , very cold be - neath the belt . But his jills would sniff ‘ n ’ shiver in the mother of a fright , ‘ N ’ go blubberin ’ ‘ n ’ quakin ’ out to waller in the fight .</p>
     <p>In the West we liked the weather , ‘ n ’ we fat - tened in the mud , Crackin ’ ‘ ardy , stewed together , rats an ’ slurry men ‘ n ’ blood . Weepin ’ Willie would n't have it these was pleasin ’ things abed , ‘ N ’ he shuddered in his shimmy if they passed him with the dead . When he cried about his mother , in a gentle voice he 'd tell Them as dumb-well did n't like it they could go to sudden ‘ ell .</p>
     <p>There was nothin ’ sweet for Willie in a rough - up in the wet ; But if all things scared him purple , not a thing had stopped him yet . If some chaps was wanted urgent special dirty work to do Willie went in with a shudder , but he alwiz saw it through . Oh , a busy little body was our Willie in a crush ! Then he 'd cry out in the night about the faces in the slush .</p>
     <p>Well they pinked him one fine mornin ’ with a thumpin ’ ‘ unk iv shell ; Put it in ‘ n ’ all across him . What he was you could n't tell . I saw him stitched ‘ n ’ mended where he whimpered in his bed , ‘ N ’ he 'd on'y lived because he was afraid to die , he said . Sez he “ Struth , they 're out there fightin ’ , trimmin ’ Boshes good ‘ n ’ smart , While I 'm bedded here ‘ n ’ ‘ elpless . It fair breaks a feller 's ‘ eart . ”</p>
     <p>But he came again last Tuesday ‘ - n ’ we go it in a breath — “ London 's big ‘ n ’ black ‘ n ’ noisy . It would scare a bloke to death . ” He 's away now in the trenches , white ‘ n ’ nervous , but , you bet , Playin ’ lovely ‘ ands of poker with his busy bay-o-net , ‘ Fraid of givin ’ ‘ n ’ of takin ’ , ‘ fraid of gases , ‘ fraid of guns — But a champion lightweight terror to the gor - forsaken ‘ Uns !</p>

     <p>THE HAPPY GARDENERS .</p>
     <p>WE were storemen , clerks and packers on an ammunition dump Twice the size of Cootamundra , and the goods we had to hump They were bombs as big as water-butts , and cartridges in tons , Shells that looked like blessed gasmains , and a line in traction-guns .</p>
     <p>We had struck a warehouse dignity in dealing with the stocks . It was , “ Sign here , Mr. Eddie ! ” “ Clarkson , forward to the socks ! ” Our floor-walker was a major , with a nozzle like a peach , And a stutter in his Trilbies ; and a limping kind of speech .</p>
     <p>We were off at eight to business , we were free for lunch at one , And we talked of new Spring fashions , and the brisk trade being done . After five we sought our dugouts lying snug beneath the hill , Each with hollyhocks before it and geraniums on the sill .</p>
     <p>Singing “ Home , Sweet home , ” we swept , and scrubbed , and dusted up the place , Then smoked out on the doorstep in the twi - light 's tender grace . After which with spade and rake we sought our special garden plot , And we ‘ tended to the cabbage and the shrink - ing young shallot .</p>
     <p>So long lived we unmolested that this seemed indeed “ the life . ” Set apart from mirk and worry and the inci - dence of strife ; And we trimmed our Kitchen Eden , swapping vegetable lore , Whi1e the whole demented world beside was muddled up with war .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">There was little talk of Boches and of bloody</l>
       <l n="2">battle scenes ,</l>
       <l n="3">But a deal about Bill 's spuds and Billy</l>
       <l n="4">Carkeek 's butter-beans ;</l>
       <l n="5">Porky specialised on onion and he had a sort</l>
       <l n="6">of gift</l>
       <l n="7">For a cabbage plump and tender that it took</l>
       <l n="8">two men to lift .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In the pleasant Sabbath morning , when the sun lit on our “ street , ” And illumed the happy dugout with effulgence kind and sweet , It was fine to see us forking , raking , picking off the bugs , Treading flat the snails and woodlice and demolishing the slugs .</p>
     <p>Then one day old Fritz got going . He had a hint of us , And the shell the blighter posted was as roomy as a ‘ bus ; He was groping round the dump , and kind of pecking after it ; When he plugged the hill the world heeled up , the dome of heaven split .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Then , 0 Gott and consternation ! Swooped a</l>
       <l n="2">shell a and stuck her nose</l>
       <l n="3">In Carkeek 's beans . Those beans came up !</l>
       <l n="4">A cry of grief arose !</l>
       <l n="5">As we watched them — plunk ! another shell</l>
       <l n="6">cut loose , and everywhere</l>
       <l n="7">Flew the spuds of Billy Murphy . There were</l>
       <l n="8">turnips in the air .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Bill ! she tore a quarter-acre from the land - scape . With it burst Tommy 's carrots , and we watched them , and in whispers prayed and cursed . Then a wail of anguish ‘ scaped us . Boomed in Porky 's cabbage plot A detestable concussion . Porky 's cabbages were not !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">There the Breaking strain was reached , for</l>
       <l n="2">Porky fetched an awful cry ,</l>
       <l n="3">And he rushed away and armed himself .</l>
       <l n="4">With loathing in his eye ,</l>
       <l n="5">Up and over went the hero . He was savage</l>
       <l n="6">Through and through ,</l>
       <l n="7">And he tore across the distance like a mad-</l>
       <l n="8">dened kangaroo .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>They had left a woeful sight indeed — frail cab - bages all rent , Turnips mangled , little carrots all in one red burial blent , Parsnips ruined , lettuce shattered , torn and wilted beet and bean , And a black and grinning gap where once our garden flourished green .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">. . . . . .</l>
       <l n="2">Five and fifty hours had passed when came a</l>
       <l n="3">German in his shirt .</l>
       <l n="4">On his back he carried Porky black with</l>
       <l n="5">blood , and smoke and dirt .</l>
       <l n="6">“ I sniped six of ‘ em , ” said Porky , “ an ’ me</l>
       <l n="7">pris'ner here , ” he sez-</l>
       <l n="8">“ I done in the crooel swine what strafed me</l>
       <l n="9">helpless cabba-ges . ”</l>

     <p>Jo strayed in at the cobbler 's door , but , scoffed at as a fool , He found the conversation too exhaustin ’ as a rule ; Or , canted on the smithy coke , he 'd hoist his feet and yawn , His boots slid up his shinbones , and his pants displayin ’ brawn : And if the copper chanced along ‘ twas beauty - ful to see Joe wear away and made hisself a fadest memory .</p>
     <p>Then came the universal nark . The Kaiser let her rip . They cleared the ring . The scrap was for the whole world 's championship . Jo Brown was takin ’ notice , lurkin ’ shy be - neath his hat , And every day he crept to see the drillin ’ on the flat . He waited , watchin ’ from the furze the blokes in butcher 's blue , For the burst of inspiration that would tell him what to do .</p>
     <p>He could n't lean , he could n't lie . He yelled out in the night . Jo understood — he 'd all these years been spoilin ’ for a fight ! Right into things he flung himself . He took his kit and gun , Mooched gladly in the dust , or roasted gaily in the sun . “ Gorstruth , ” he said , with shining eyes , “ it means a frightful war , ‘ N ’ now I know this is the thing that Heaven meant me for . ”</p>

     <p>I had me fit of longin ’ on the night the Ger - mans came , All breathin ’ lioke a gas attack . The air was halcholic . We smelt ‘ em in the darkness , ‘ n ’ our rage went up in flame . It was envy , squealin ’ envy , put the ginger in the frolic . We shot ‘ em full of spelter , then went over it to spite The swines what drunk the liquor that was ours by common right .</p>
     <p>“ If this ai n't stopped , ‘ n ’ quick , ” sez we , “ there wo n't be left a drop To celebrate the vict'ry when we capture their position . ” I 'm prowlin ’ blind , when sharp there comes a fond , familiar plop - Swung round a post , a German in a pitiful condition Looms over me . He 's sprung a cork , and shales a flask on high , ‘ N ’ sings of beer that touchin ’ it would make a butcher cry .</p>
     <p>Sez he : “ Berloffed kamarid , you haf some drinks mit you . ” I meant to spike him where he waved , but altered me intention . ‘ N ’ “ If you put it thus , ” sez I , “ I do n't care if I do . ” We had a drink together . There 's a tem - por'y suspension Of hostilities to sample contraband ‘ n ’ other stuff In the enemy 's possession . Which I think he 's had enough .</p>
     <p>That Hun had thirty pockets , ‘ n ’ he 'd stowed a flask in each , ‘ N ’ presently I 'm thinkin ’ I could love him like a brother . He 's talkin ’ fond ‘ n ’ friendly in outlandish parts of speech . “ You 're prisoner of war , ” I sez ; ‘ n ’ then we had another . Ten flasks he pours into his hat , ‘ n ’ fills it to the brim , ‘ N ’ weeps ‘ n ’ sez his frau she will be waitin ’ up for him .</p>
     <p>We drink each other 's health , ‘ n ’ know no henmity nor fear . I see I 've got to pinch him , but he 's out to do his div . in , ‘ N ’ do n't care if he do n't go home till day - light doth appear . Sez he : “ I pud you home to bed upside dot ‘ ouse you live in . ” He shakes his finger in me eye : “ Mein friendt , you 're preddy trunk ! ” Then arm in arm through No Man 's land we does a social bunk .</p>
