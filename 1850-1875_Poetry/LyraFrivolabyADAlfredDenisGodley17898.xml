  <body>
   <p>If it still is your luck to be left in the ruck , and of fame you 're an impotent seeker , If you fruitlessly aim at a Senate 's acclaim when you can n't catch the eye of the Speaker , If whenever you rise you observe with surprise that the House is perceptibly thinner , And your eloquent pleas are a sign to M. P . ' s that it 's nearly the time for their dinner :</p>
   <p>Should you sigh for the heights where the eminent lights , in the region of letters who shine , are ; Should your novels and tales have indifferent sales and your verses be hopelessly minor , Should the public refuse your attempts to peruse when you try to instruct or to shock it , While it adds to the spoils of its Barries and Doyles , and increases the hoards of a Crockett :</p>
   <p>If you 're baffled , in short , by the fame that you court , and your name 's overlooked by the papers ,— There 's a road to success without toil or distress , or nocturnal consumption of tapers : By adopting this plan you 're a prominent man , and no longer a painful aspirant : You must come on the scene as a bold Philhellene , and a foe to the Turk and the Tyrant !</p>
   <p>You 'll orate to the crowd on the heritage proud which by Greece is bequeathed to the nations ( You can gain in a week an acquaintance with Greek by a liberal use of translations ) , And the names that you quote with the aid of your “ Grote ” and a noble assumption of choler , Will attest that you feel that excusable zeal which belongs to an eminent scholar .</p>
   <p>You will prate before mobs of Lord Salisbury 's jobs and the villainous schemes of the Kaiser , Which will make them believe you 've a plan up your sleeve if they 'd only take you for adviser ; You may cheerfully speak of assisting the Greek ‘ gainst the foes that his country environ : ‘ Tis improbable quite you 'll be wanted to fight , and the phrase will remind them of Byron .</p>
   <p>If you can n't get a place in Society 's race , and you have to confess that you 're beaten , Yet I hope I have shown you may make yourself known by espousing the cause of the Cretan : You will sell all your works by denouncing the Turks , and the public will hasten to read ‘ em , When in reverent tones you are mentioned as “ Jones , the Defender and Champion of Freedom ! ”</p>

    <head>L'AFFAIRE ( CHAPTER ONE )</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It was a little Bordereau that lay upon the ground :</l>
     <l n="2">The Franco-Gallic Government that document it found ,</l>
     <l n="3">And straightway drew the inference , though how I do not know ,</l>
     <l n="4">Some Jew had sold to Germany this dreadful Bordereau .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">‘ Tis all ( they said ) a Hebrew trick — - a treasonable plan —</l>
     <l n="6">And , now we come to think of it , why Dreyfus is the man !</l>
     <l n="7">At any rate ( they argued thus ) , it is for him to show</l>
     <l n="8">That he is not the criminal who sold the Bordereau .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Some hinted at another man , whose autograph it bore —</l>
     <l n="10">But this was Dreyfus ’ artifice , and proved his guilt the more :</l>
     <l n="11">No motive for the horrid deed confessedly he had :</l>
     <l n="12">And crimes which are gratuitous are nearly twice as bad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">They caught that Jew ( did Government ) and charged him with the sale ;</l>
     <l n="14">They proved his guilt — or said they did — and shut him up in gaol ;</l>
     <l n="15">And then , their case to justify and show their verdict true ,</l>
     <l n="16">They took and baited every one who called himself a Jew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">These incidents an uproar caused like Donnybrook its Fair :</l>
     <l n="18">Wherever Frenchmen met to talk ‘ twas Pandemonium there :</l>
     <l n="19">And anywhere except in France you 'd argue from events</l>
     <l n="20">That Ministers had rather lost the public confidence .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Then spake the German Government ( and here I must deplore</l>
     <l n="22">The fact that they had not presumed to mention it before ):</l>
     <l n="23">“ Although , ” they said respectfully , “ we would not interfere</l>
     <l n="24">With any Angelegenheit outside our proper sphere —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Why make this quite-essentially-unnecessary fuss ?</l>
     <l n="26">This compromising document was never sold to us :</l>
     <l n="27">Potztausend ! ” said the Chancellor , “ upon my honour , no !</l>
     <l n="28">We have not got and do not want your precious Bordereau ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">This rather struck the Ministers , in Paris where they sat :</l>
     <l n="30">They took and read the Bordereau : they had not yet done that .</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Twas found to mention obvious facts which any one might know —</l>
     <l n="32">No horrid revelations lurked within the Bordereau !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">And did they set poor Dreyfus free , the due amends to make ,</l>
     <l n="34">Regain the public confidence by owning their mistake ,</l>
     <l n="35">And cease for popularity by sordid means to bid ?</l>
     <l n="36">These are the things they might have done ; but this is what they did :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">They said , those Gallic Ministers , “ Undoubtedly it 's true</l>
     <l n="38">The document has not been sold , and is not worth a sou ;</l>
     <l n="39">But as the man 's in prison now , why , there he 's got to stay —</l>
     <l n="40">Que voulez-vous ? ” they simply said , “ it is a Chose Jugée ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">This artless little narrative is specially designed</l>
     <l n="42">To illustrate the workings of the Gallic statesman 's mind ;</l>
     <l n="43">And till they change those processes and mould their ways anew ,</l>
     <l n="44">It is not yet in Paris that I want to be a Jew .</l>

   <p>UNSELFISH DEVOTION</p>
   <p>Ye Concerts who plan for the welfare of Man and compose his occasional quarrels , Whom we properly deem to be teachers supreme in the sphere of Political Morals , May you win the renown that your efforts should crown and reward your assiduous labours In arranging the cares and embarrassed affairs that afflict your unfortunate neighbours !</p>
   <p>Should a potentate go for his national foe , and , as soon as he 's thoroughly licked him , Should he dare to demand a concession of land from his prostrate and paralyzed victim , It is then you arise and his arm you arrest when his harvest is ripe for the reaping , And a people oppressed may in confidence rest when it 's safe in Diplomacy 's keeping .</p>
   <p>It is you who protest in a horrified tone at a hint of Integrity 's danger , And the victor is shown that a Concert alone is of Law and of Fate the arranger : With a warlike display of your fleets in array and of Maxims ( both empty and loaded ) You establish it plain that his notions of gain are immoral and also exploded !</p>
   <p>Let the blasphemous cry that it 's done with an eye to your ultimate personal profit , That your chivalrous task is but worn as a mask till occasion allows you to doff it , Let the caviller say that the victim to-day is preserved from a final disaster , And is saved from the Japs that to-morrow perhaps he may furnish a meal for their master :</p>
   <p>Yet I cannot believe that what Concerts achieve is by reasons ulterior dictated , I am perfectly sure that their motives are pure ( by themselves it is frequently stated ) ; By themselves we are taught that they never in thought could the Good with the Selfish commingle — What they do is designed for the good of mankind with an eye that is simple and single !</p>
   <p>For whomever — e. g ., let us say the Chinee — you have freed from the fear of invasion , Should he presently seem in a posture to be which is open to Moral Persuasion ,— How you take him in hand , a philanthropist band ! how you toil to improve his condition , With a noble disdain of the trouble and pain of a wholly unselfish Partition !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">For it grieves you , of course , when — ignoring the force</l>
     <l n="2">which the doctrine of Mine and of Thine has —</l>
     <l n="3">E'en Integrity 's self you must lay on the shelf</l>
     <l n="4">( I allude , not to Europe 's but China 's ) !</l>
     <l n="5">Let detractors contend that your means and your end</l>
     <l n="6">are the end and the means of the vulture —</l>
     <l n="7">Such an altruist plan must betoken the man</l>
     <l n="8">who is bent on diffusion of culture .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Be it yours to assuage for inadequate wage our unseemly contentions and quarrels , Be it yours to maintain your respectable reign in the sphere of Political Morals ; And , relying no more on the shedding of gore or the rule of torpedoes and sabres , Make beneficent plots for dividing in lots the domains of your paralyzed neighbours !</p>

     <l n="1">Come hither , Terence Mulligan , and sit upon the floor ,</l>

   <p>MR MORLEY 'S APOLOGY ( 1893 )</p>
   <p>We statesmen of Erin , Archbishops , M. P . ' s , and Leaders of National Thought , Pray explain to your friends that I 'm anxious to please , if I do not succeed as I ought ! When I sympathize quite with their notions of right , it is hard , as I 'm sure you 'll agree , That an agent should come with a dynamite bomb , which perhaps was intended for me !</p>
   <p>My views on the tenants evicted for debt are identical wholly with yours , And the fact that they 're not in possession as yet no statesman more deeply deplores : I approve of explosives — they 're often a link which our union may serve to complete — But they 're dangerous too , as I venture to think , when employed in a populous street .</p>
   <p>I planned the Commission ; I packed it with men opposed to the payment of rent ; No landlord had ever evicted again if they only had done what I meant : It “ adjourned , ” as I know , in a fortnight or so , and it did not do much while it sat , But I was not to blame if we failed in our aim — for I could not anticipate that .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Tis a shame , I agree , that I cannot set free</l>
     <l n="2">all persons who kill the police ;</l>
     <l n="3">That patriots leal who in dynamite deal</l>
     <l n="4">I can only in sections release :</l>
     <l n="5">But I think you must see that a statesman like me</l>
     <l n="6">has a character moral at stake ,</l>

     <l n="32">Made a law for restoring Cornelius Molloy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">Cornelius came back to his former abode ,</l>

   <p>A NEW DEPARTURE</p>
   <p>SHOULD IRELAND SEND HER M. P. S TO WASHINGTON ?</p>
   <p>Oh , the Irish M. P. s they are bound for the seas , to the country of Cleveland and Blaine , And I hear for a fact , their portmanteaus are packed and we never shall see them again , And Hibernia thrills through her valleys and hills with a passionate cry of farewell , While the manager weeps as they 're paying their bills , in the “ Westminster Palace hotel !</p>
   <p>Though he lived all the while in the highest of style and was fed at his country 's expense , Yet he felt ( did the Celt ) that in Meshech he dwelt , and resided in Kedar its tents , And he yearned in his heart to be playing a part in a higher and holier sphere — For his soul was alight with a zeal for the Right that we cannot appreciate here .</p>
   <p>Oh , the story is long of the villainous wrong he endured from the Sassenach reign , How he languished for weeks , minus freedom ( and breeks ) , for supporting the Plan of Campaign ; How , when statesmen arose , to diminish his woes , and the tide of oppression to stem , We ejected the friends who promoted his ends , and refused to be guided by them .</p>
   <p>For the Tories have won , and the party is gone that he ruled with his counsel and swayed , And there 's no one cares that for the suffrage of Pat or will stoop to solicit his aid : So the sons of the Gael have determined to sail for the regions serene of the West , Where a Balfour 's police from their bludgeoning cease , and the Patriot weary may rest !</p>
   <p>‘ Tis in Congress he 'll find the intelligent mind which is able to probe to the roots The malignant intrigue that endangers the League , and M'Carthy ' s and Dillon 's disputes ,— Which is sure to postpone all affairs of its own and to list to Tim Healy intent When he takes up the tale of Compulsory Sale , or complete abolition of rent .</p>
   <p>There 'll be wigs on the green ( as in No . 15 ) and the usual trailing of coats , For I happen to know Mr Redmond will go , — by a separate service of boats :— And O'Brien will show , while he jumps on his foe and his blood fratricidally sheds , That the Union of Hearts of necessity starts from a general breaking of heads .</p>
   <p>The Hibernian M. P. s are afloat on the seas , the debates of the West to control , And the thought of their scheme 's a magnificent dream which may calm our disconsolate soul : For if ever the Yanks should return them with thanks and consider their presence a bore , We have plenty of cranks in the Radical ranks , and can always supply them with more !</p>
