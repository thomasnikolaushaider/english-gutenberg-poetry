    <head>HOW THE CHRISTMAS TREE WAS BROUGHT TO NOME</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Night of the winter — winter and night in the city of Nome ,</l>
     <l n="2">There where the many are dwelling , but no man yet has a home !</l>
     <l n="3">Desolate league upon league , ice-pack and tundra and hill ;</l>
     <l n="4">And the dark of the year when the gold-hunter 's rocker and dredge</l>
     <l n="5">are still !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">By the fire that is no man 's hearth ,— by the fire more precious than</l>
     <l n="7">gold ,—</l>
     <l n="8">They are passing the time as they may , encompassed by storm and by</l>
     <l n="9">cold :</l>
     <l n="10">And their talk is of pay-streak and bedrock , of claim by seashore or</l>
     <l n="11">creek ,</l>
     <l n="12">Of the brigantine fast in the ice-pack this many and many a week ;</l>
     <l n="13">Wraiths of the mist and the snow encumber her canvas and deck ,—</l>
     <l n="14">And the Eskimos swear that a crew out of ghostland are crowding the</l>
     <l n="15">wreck !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">Thus , in the indolent dark of the year , in the city of Nome ,</l>
     <l n="17">They were passing the time as they might , but ever their thoughts</l>
     <l n="18">turned home .</l>
     <l n="19">Said the Man from the East , “ In God 's country now ( where we 'd all</l>
     <l n="20">like to be ) ,</l>
     <l n="21">You may bet your life there 's a big boom on for the Christmas Tree ;</l>
     <l n="22">And we 'd have one here , but there is n't a shrub as high as my hand ,</l>
     <l n="23">Nor the smell of spruce , for a hundred miles , in all this land ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="24">Then the Man from the South arose : “ I allow , if the Tree could be</l>
     <l n="25">found ,</l>
     <l n="26">I 'd ‘ tend to the fruit myself , and stand ye a treat all round ! ”</l>
     <l n="27">“ Done ! ” said the Man from the West ( the youngest of all was he ) .</l>
     <l n="28">“ I 'll lose my claim in the ruby sand — or I 'll find the Tree ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">The restless Aurora is waving her banners wide through the dome ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the Man from the West is off , while yet they are sleeping in</l>
     <l n="31">Nome !</l>
     <l n="32">Off , ere the low-browed dawn , with Eskimo , sledge , and team :</l>
     <l n="33">He is leaving the tundra behind , he is climbing the source of the</l>
     <l n="34">stream !</l>
     <l n="35">On , beyond Sinrock — on , while the miles and the dim hours glide —</l>
     <l n="36">On , toward the evergreen belt that darkens the mountain side !</l>
     <l n="37">‘ Tis a hundred miles or more ; but his team is strong , is swift ,</l>
     <l n="38">And brief are his slumbers at night , in the lee of the feathery</l>
     <l n="39">drift !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="40">There were watchful eyes , there were anxious hearts in the city of</l>
     <l n="41">Nome ;</l>
     <l n="42">And they cheered with a will when the Man from the West with his</l>
     <l n="43">prize came home !</l>
     <l n="44">And they cheered again for the Christmas Tree that was brought from</l>
     <l n="45">far ,</l>
     <l n="46">Chained to his sledge , like a king of old to the conqueror 's car !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Said the Man from the South , “ I 'll ‘ tend to the fruit that grows on the Tree ! ” Said the Man from the East , “ Leave the Christmas dinner and trimmings to me ! ”</p>

     <l n="72">( Full soon they would be kneeling , as we guessed ! )</l>
     <l n="73">And on , and on — and now , at times , it seemed</l>

     <l n="79">Then , while less confident our pace would grow ,</l>
     <l n="80">Wiser than I — a twelvemonth and a day ,</l>
     <l n="81">Would Rene counsel : Might it not be so —</l>

     <l n="88">To our good parish , yet must they fulfil</l>
     <l n="89">The prayers of all ; and there were other folk</l>
     <l n="90">Who , if unvisited , would take it ill .</l>

     <l n="105">There came a winter wild and dim with snow .</l>
     <l n="106">It seemed to us that sheeted ghosts did go</l>

     <l n="108">And one of us with fever was laid low :</l>
     <l n="109">Like leaves the little hands were tossed and thrown ,</l>

     <l n="113">And suddenly , across a scarp of cloud</l>
     <l n="114">One crimson flame , a parting sunbeam shot .</l>
     <l n="115">It reached Annette upon the low , white cot ,</l>
     <l n="116">It touched our mother 's face , Madonna-mild .</l>
     <l n="117">With dreaming eyes that saw us , yet saw not ,</l>
     <l n="118">Petite Annette threw out her hand and smiled :</l>

     <l n="1">An East Side Incident</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">“ Whose dog is Jack ? ” He belongs to this street .</l>
     <l n="3">Needs anti-fat — has too much to eat .</l>
     <l n="4">“ Houseless and homeless ? ” — Well I guess not ;</l>
     <l n="5">In the whole of this block there is n't a tot</l>
     <l n="6">But has had Jack home to board and to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="7">And he pays ‘ em in fun , every cent of his keep .</l>
     <l n="8">He 's the best-natured dog , and the smartest , too ;</l>
     <l n="9">No end of the tricks we 've taught him to do .</l>
     <l n="10">Got a heap of sense in his yellow hide !</l>
     <l n="11">He 's the wonderf'lest dog on the whole East Side ;</l>
     <l n="12">Why , even the dog-man does n't know</l>
     <l n="13">What breed Jack is ,— for he told me so !</l>
     <l n="14">The dog-catchers came a'most every day ,</l>
     <l n="15">But Jack knew their cart , and he 'd hide away ;</l>
     <l n="16">Then out he 'd come , laughing , when they 'd got past .</l>
     <l n="17">Ca n't guess how he ever was cotched at last ;</l>
     <l n="18">But he was , and they boosted him into their cart ,</l>
     <l n="19">And nobody there could take his part .</l>
     <l n="20">My ! but the little kids cried like mad ,</l>
     <l n="21">And us bigger ones , too ,— we felt just as bad ;</l>
     <l n="22">For he 'd rode us all on his old yellow back .</l>
     <l n="23">It looked as though it was all up with Jack ,</l>
     <l n="24">And I watched him go ; but he cocked one eye</l>
     <l n="25">As much as to say , “ I 'll be back by and by . ”</l>
     <l n="26">The look that he gave me — it made me think ;</l>
     <l n="27">And I thought of a plan as quick as wink</l>
     <l n="28">And I says , “ Feller-citizens , ladies and gents ,</l>
     <l n="29">I guess that we 've each of us got a few cents ,</l>
     <l n="30">And we 'll club together and have a show ,</l>
     <l n="31">And charge a price , not high nor low ;</l>
     <l n="32">And we 'll raise the money , right here and now ,</l>
     <l n="33">That 'll buy Jack back by to-morrow — that 's how !</l>
     <l n="34">Tony , the Eyetalian boy , he 'll sing ;</l>
     <l n="35">And Patsy McGovern 'll do his handspring ;</l>
     <l n="36">And Ikey Aarons 'll swallow his knife ,</l>
     <l n="37">And make us all think he 's taking his life ,</l>
     <l n="38">And little Freda , she 'll pass round the hat ,</l>
     <l n="39">She 'll smile and say nothing — she 's just good for that ! ”</l>
     <l n="40">Well , we emptied our pockets — you bet we did !—</l>
     <l n="41">Every one of us big ‘ uns and each little kid</l>
     <l n="42">Ran home for their banks as fast as they could ;</l>
     <l n="43">And we raised the money , and all felt good ;</l>
     <l n="44">And next day , early , we brought Jack back .</l>
     <l n="45">So , now , things run in the same old track ,</l>
     <l n="46">But he 's got his license and do n't have to hide !</l>
     <l n="47">And we 've bought him a byootiful collar beside .</l>

     <l n="14">Six-pointed its comrades are ,—</l>

    <head>JUNE IN THE SKY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Slow through the light and silent air ,</l>
     <l n="2">Up climbs the smoke on its spiral stair —</l>
     <l n="3">The visible flight of some mortal 's prayer ;</l>
     <l n="4">The trees are in bloom with the flowers of frost ,</l>
     <l n="5">But never a feathery leaf is lost ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">The spring , descending , is caught and bound</l>
     <l n="7">Ere its silver feet can touch the ground ;</l>
     <l n="8">So still is the air that lies , this morn ,</l>
     <l n="9">Over the snow-cold fields forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Tis as though Italy 's heaven smiled</l>
     <l n="11">In the face of some bleak Norwegian wild ;</l>
     <l n="12">And the heart in me sings — I know not why —</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Tis winter on earth , but June in the sky !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">June in the sky ! Ah , now I can see</l>
     <l n="15">The souls of roses about to be ,</l>
     <l n="16">In gardens of heaven beckoning me ,</l>
     <l n="17">Roses red-lipped , and roses pale ,</l>
     <l n="18">Fanned by the tremulous ether gale !</l>
     <l n="19">Some of them climbing a window-ledge ,</l>
     <l n="20">Some of them peering from wayside hedge ,</l>
     <l n="21">As yonder , adrift on the aery stream ,</l>
     <l n="22">Love drives his plumed and filleted team ;</l>
     <l n="23">The Angel of Summer aloft I see ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the souls of roses about to be !</l>
     <l n="25">And the heart in me sings — the heart knows why —</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Tis winter on earth , but June in the sky .</l>

    <head>THE RAIN RAINS EVERY DAY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Said the robin to his mate</l>
     <l n="2">In the dripping orchard tree :</l>

     <l n="4">Till the blue sky we can see .</l>
     <l n="5">Birds can neither work nor play ,</l>

     <l n="7">And the rain rains all the day ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Said the violet to the leaf :</l>

     <l n="11">Close along the earth I lie .</l>
     <l n="12">All we flowers for sunshine pray ,</l>
     <l n="13">But the rain rains every day ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the rain rains all the day ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">And the children , far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="16">They , too , wished away the rain ;</l>
     <l n="17">All their sports were spoiled outside</l>
     <l n="18">By the “ black glove ” at the pane .</l>

     <l n="19">Very dull indoors to stay</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="22">Up and down the murmurs run ,</l>
     <l n="23">Shared by child and bird and flower .</l>
     <l n="24">Suddenly the golden sun</l>
     <l n="25">Dazzled through a clearing shower .</l>
     <l n="26">Then they all forgot to say</l>
     <l n="27">That “ the rain rains every day ,</l>
