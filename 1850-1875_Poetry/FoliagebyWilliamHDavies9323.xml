       <l n="3">Thou hast not felt thy bosom keep</l>

       <l n="18">Nor hast thou sat on stones that lie</l>
       <l n="19">Flat on the earth , that once did rise</l>
       <l n="20">To hide proud kings from common eyes ,</l>
       <l n="21">Thou hast not seen plains full of bloom</l>
       <l n="22">Where green things had such little room</l>
       <l n="23">They pleased the eye like fairer flowers —</l>
       <l n="24">Sweet Stay-at-Home , all these long hours .</l>

       <l n="27">For thou hast made more homely stuff</l>

       <l n="2">This is no time to sit and think ;</l>

       <l n="6">And whined for mercy unto him ;</l>
       <l n="7">Knights , constables , and men-at-arms</l>
       <l n="8">Have quailed and whined in sleep 's alarms .</l>
       <l n="9">Thou wert not kind last night to make</l>
       <l n="10">Me like a very coward shake —</l>
       <l n="11">Shake like a thin red-currant bush</l>
       <l n="12">Robbed of its fruit by a strong thrush .</l>
       <l n="13">I felt this earth did move ; more slow ,</l>
       <l n="14">And slower yet began to go ;</l>
       <l n="15">And not a bird was heard to sing ,</l>
       <l n="16">Men and great beasts were shivering ;</l>
       <l n="17">All living things knew well that when</l>
       <l n="18">This earth stood still , destruction then</l>
       <l n="19">Would follow with a mighty crash .</l>
       <l n="20">‘ Twas then I broke that awful hush :</l>
       <l n="21">E'en as a mother , who does come</l>
       <l n="22">Running in haste back to her home ,</l>
       <l n="23">And looks at once , and lo , the child</l>
       <l n="24">She left asleep is gone ; and wild</l>
       <l n="25">She shrieks and loud — so did I break</l>
       <l n="26">With a mad cry that dream , and wake .</l>

      <head>WHEN THE CUCKOO SINGS</head>
       <l n="1">In summer , when the Cuckoo sings ,</l>

       <l n="3">When every leafy tree doth hold</l>
       <l n="4">A loving heart that beats with mine :</l>
       <l n="5">Now , when the Brook has cresses green ,</l>

       <l n="9">Then , like red Robin in the spring ,</l>
       <l n="10">I shun those haunts where men are found ;</l>
       <l n="11">My house holds little joy until</l>
       <l n="12">Leaves fall and birds can make no sound ;</l>
       <l n="13">Let none invade that wilderness</l>
       <l n="14">Into whose dark green depths I go —</l>

      <head>RETURN TO NATURE</head>
       <l n="1">My song is of that city which</l>
       <l n="2">Has men too poor and men too rich ;</l>
       <l n="3">Where some are sick , too richly fed ,</l>
       <l n="4">While others take the sparrows ’ bread :</l>
       <l n="5">Where some have beds to warm their bones ,</l>
       <l n="6">While others sleep on hard , cold stones</l>
       <l n="7">That suck away their bodies ’ heat .</l>
       <l n="8">Where men are drunk in every street ;</l>
       <l n="9">Men full of poison , like those flies</l>
       <l n="10">That still attack the horses ’ eyes .</l>
       <l n="11">Where some men freeze for want of cloth ,</l>
       <l n="12">While others show their jewels ’ worth</l>
       <l n="13">And dress in satin , fur or silk ;</l>
       <l n="14">Where fine rich ladies wash in milk ,</l>
       <l n="15">While starving mothers have no food</l>
       <l n="16">To make them fit in flesh and blood ;</l>
       <l n="17">So that their watery breasts can give</l>
       <l n="18">Their babies milk and make them live .</l>
       <l n="19">Where one man does the work of four ,</l>
       <l n="20">And dies worn out before his hour ;</l>
       <l n="21">While some seek work in vain , and grief</l>
       <l n="22">Doth make their fretful lives as brief .</l>
       <l n="23">Where ragged men are seen to wait</l>
       <l n="24">For charity that 's small and late ;</l>
       <l n="25">While others haunt in idle leisure ,</l>
       <l n="26">Theatre doors to pay for pleasure .</l>
       <l n="27">No more I 'll walk those crowded places</l>
       <l n="28">And take hot dreams from harlots ’ faces ;</l>
       <l n="29">I 'll know no more those passions ’ dreams ,</l>
       <l n="30">While musing near these quiet streams ;</l>
       <l n="31">That biting state of savage lust</l>
       <l n="32">Which , true love absent , burns to dust .</l>
       <l n="33">Gold 's rattle shall not rob my ears</l>
       <l n="34">Of this sweet music of the spheres .</l>
       <l n="35">I 'll walk abroad with fancy free ;</l>
       <l n="36">Each leafy , summer 's morn I 'll see</l>
       <l n="37">The trees , all legs or bodies , when</l>
       <l n="38">They vary in their shapes like men .</l>
       <l n="39">I 'll walk abroad and see again</l>
       <l n="40">How quiet pools are pricked by rain ;</l>
       <l n="41">And you shall hear a song as sweet</l>
       <l n="42">As when green leaves and raindrops meet .</l>
       <l n="43">I 'll hear the Nightingale 's fine mood ,</l>
       <l n="44">Rattling with thunder in the wood ,</l>
       <l n="45">Made bolder by each mighty crash ;</l>
       <l n="46">Who drives her notes with every flash</l>
       <l n="47">Of lightning through the summer 's night .</l>
       <l n="48">No more I 'll walk in that pale light</l>
       <l n="49">That shows the homeless man awake ,</l>
       <l n="50">Ragged and cold ; harlot and rake ,</l>
       <l n="51">That have their hearts in rags , and die</l>
       <l n="52">Before that poor wretch they pass by .</l>
       <l n="53">Nay , I have found a life so fine</l>
       <l n="54">That every moment seems divine ;</l>
       <l n="55">By shunning all those pleasures full ,</l>
       <l n="56">That bring repentance cold and dull .</l>
       <l n="57">Such misery seen in days gone by ,</l>
       <l n="58">That , made a coward , now I fly</l>
       <l n="59">To green things , like a bird . Alas !</l>
       <l n="60">In days gone by I could not pass</l>
       <l n="61">Ten men but what the eyes of one</l>
       <l n="62">Would burn me for no kindness done ;</l>
       <l n="63">And wretched women I passed by</l>
       <l n="64">Sent after me a moan or sigh .</l>
       <l n="65">Ah , wretched days : for in that place</l>
       <l n="66">My soul 's leaves sought the human face ,</l>
       <l n="67">And not the Sun 's for warmth and light —</l>
       <l n="68">And so was never free from blight .</l>
       <l n="69">But seek me now , and you will find</l>
       <l n="70">Me on some soft green bank reclined ;</l>
       <l n="71">Watching the stately deer close by ,</l>
       <l n="72">That in a great deep hollow lie</l>
       <l n="73">Shaking their tails with all the ease</l>
       <l n="74">That lambs can . First , look for the trees ,</l>
       <l n="75">Then , if you seek me , find me quick .</l>
       <l n="76">Seek me no more where men are thick ,</l>
       <l n="77">But in green lanes where I can walk</l>
       <l n="78">A mile , and still no human folk</l>
       <l n="79">Tread on my shadow . Seek me where</l>
       <l n="80">The strange oak tree is , that can bear</l>
       <l n="81">One white-leaved branch among the green —</l>
       <l n="82">Which many a woodman has not seen .</l>
       <l n="83">If you would find me , go where cows</l>
       <l n="84">And sheep stand under shady boughs ;</l>
       <l n="85">Where furious squirrels shake a tree</l>
       <l n="86">As though they 'd like to bury me</l>
       <l n="87">Under a leaf shower heavy , and</l>
       <l n="88">I laugh at them for spite , and stand .</l>
       <l n="89">Seek me no more in human ways —</l>
       <l n="90">Who am a coward since those days</l>
       <l n="91">My mind was burned by poor men 's eyes ,</l>
       <l n="92">And frozen by poor women 's sighs .</l>
       <l n="93">Then send your pearls across the sea ,</l>
       <l n="94">Your feathers , scent and ivory ,</l>
       <l n="95">You distant lands — but let my bales</l>
       <l n="96">Be brought by Cuckoos , Nightingales ,</l>
       <l n="97">That come in spring from your far shores ;</l>
       <l n="98">Sweet birds that carry richer stores</l>
       <l n="99">Than men can dream of , when they prize</l>
       <l n="100">Fine silks and pearls for merchandise ;</l>
       <l n="101">And dream of ships that take the floods</l>
       <l n="102">Sunk to their decks with such vain goods ;</l>
       <l n="103">Bringing that traitor silk , whose soft</l>
       <l n="104">Smooth tongue persuades the poor too oft</l>
       <l n="105">From sweet content ; and pearls , whose fires</l>
       <l n="106">Make ashes of our best desires .</l>
       <l n="107">For I have heard the sighs and whines</l>
       <l n="108">Of rich men that drink costly wines</l>
       <l n="109">And eat the best of fish and fowl ;</l>
       <l n="110">Men that have plenty , and still growl</l>
       <l n="111">Because they cannot like kings live —</l>
       <l n="112">“ Alas ! ” they whine , “ we cannot save . ”</l>
       <l n="113">Since I have heard those rich ones sigh ,</l>
       <l n="114">Made poor by their desires so high ,</l>
       <l n="115">I cherish more a simple mind ;</l>
       <l n="116">That I am well content to find</l>
       <l n="117">My pictures in the open air ,</l>
       <l n="118">And let my walls and floors go bare ;</l>
       <l n="119">That I with lovely things can fill</l>
       <l n="120">My rooms , whene'er sweet Fancy will .</l>
       <l n="121">I make a fallen tree my chair ,</l>
       <l n="122">And soon forget no cushion 's there ;</l>
       <l n="123">I lie upon the grass or straw ,</l>
       <l n="124">And no soft down do I sigh for ;</l>
       <l n="125">For with me all the time I keep</l>
       <l n="126">Sweet dreams that , do I wake or sleep ,</l>
       <l n="127">Shed on me still their kindly beams ;</l>
       <l n="128">Aye , I am richer with my dreams</l>
       <l n="129">Than banks where men dull-eyed and cold</l>
       <l n="130">Without a tremble shovel gold .</l>
       <l n="131">A happy life is this . I walk</l>
       <l n="132">And hear more birds than people talk ;</l>
       <l n="133">I hear the birds that sing unseen ,</l>
       <l n="134">On boughs now smothered with leaves green ;</l>
       <l n="135">I sit and watch the swallows there ,</l>
       <l n="136">Making a circus in the air ;</l>
       <l n="137">That speed around straight-going crow ,</l>
       <l n="138">As sharks around a ship can go ;</l>
       <l n="139">I hear the skylark out of sight ,</l>
       <l n="140">Hid perfectly in all this light .</l>
       <l n="141">The dappled cows in fields I pass ,</l>
       <l n="142">Up to their bosoms in deep grass ;</l>
       <l n="143">Old oak trees , with their bowels gone ,</l>
       <l n="144">I see with spring 's green finery on .</l>
       <l n="145">I watch the buzzing bees for hours ,</l>
       <l n="146">To see them rush at laughing flowers —</l>
       <l n="147">And butterflies that lie so still .</l>
       <l n="148">I see great houses on the hill ,</l>
       <l n="149">With shining roofs ; and there shines one ,</l>
       <l n="150">It seems that heaven has dropped the sun .</l>
       <l n="151">I see yon cloudlet sail the skies ,</l>
       <l n="152">Racing with clouds ten times its size .</l>
       <l n="153">I walk green pathways , where love waits</l>
       <l n="154">To talk in whispers at old gates ;</l>
       <l n="155">Past stiles — on which I lean , alone —</l>
       <l n="156">Carved with the names of lovers gone ;</l>
       <l n="157">I stand on arches whose dark stones</l>
       <l n="158">Can turn the wind 's soft sighs to groans .</l>
       <l n="159">I hear the Cuckoo when first he</l>
       <l n="160">Makes this green world 's discovery ,</l>
       <l n="161">And re-creates it in my mind ,</l>
       <l n="162">Proving my eyes were growing blind .</l>
       <l n="163">I see the rainbow come forth clear</l>
       <l n="164">And wave her coloured scarf to cheer</l>
       <l n="165">The sun long swallowed by a flood —</l>
       <l n="166">So do I live in lane and wood .</l>
       <l n="167">Let me look forward to each spring</l>
       <l n="168">As eager as the birds that sing ;</l>
       <l n="169">And feed my eyes on spring 's young flowers</l>
       <l n="170">Before the bees by many hours ,</l>
       <l n="171">My heart to leap and sing her praise</l>
       <l n="172">Before the birds by many days .</l>
       <l n="173">Go white my hair and skin go dry —</l>
       <l n="174">But let my heart a dewdrop lie</l>
       <l n="175">Inside those leaves when they go wrong ,</l>
       <l n="176">As fresh as when my life was young .</l>

      <head>A STRANGE CITY</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A wondrous city , that had temples there</l>
       <l n="2">More rich than that one built by David 's son ,</l>
       <l n="3">Which called forth Ophir 's gold , when Israel</l>
       <l n="4">Made Lebanon half naked for her sake .</l>
       <l n="5">I saw white towers where so-called traitors died —</l>
       <l n="6">True men whose tongues were bells to honest hearts ,</l>
       <l n="7">And rang out boldly in false monarch 's ears .</l>
       <l n="8">Saw old black gateways , on whose arches crouched</l>
       <l n="9">Stone lions with their bodies gnawed by age .</l>
       <l n="10">I looked with awe on iron gates that could</l>
       <l n="11">Tell bloody stones if they had our tongues .</l>
       <l n="12">I saw tall mounted spires shine in the sun ,</l>
       <l n="13">That stood amidst their army of low streets .</l>
       <l n="14">I saw in buildings pictures , statues rare ,</l>
       <l n="15">Made in those days when Rome was young , and new</l>
       <l n="16">In marble quarried from Carrara 's hills ;</l>
       <l n="17">Statues by sculptors that could almost make</l>
       <l n="18">Fine cobwebs out of stone — so light they worked .</l>
       <l n="19">Pictures that breathe in us a living soul ,</l>
       <l n="20">Such as we seldom feel come from that life</l>
       <l n="21">The artist copies . Many a lovely sight —</l>
       <l n="22">Such as the half sunk barge with bales of hay ,</l>
       <l n="23">Or sparkling coals — employed my wondering eyes .</l>
       <l n="24">I saw old Thames , whose ripples swarmed with stars</l>
       <l n="25">Bred by the sun on that fine summer 's day ;</l>
       <l n="26">I saw in fancy fowl and green banks there ,</l>
       <l n="27">And Liza 's barge rowed past a thousand swans .</l>
       <l n="28">I walked in parks and heard sweet music cry</l>
       <l n="29">In solemn courtyards , midst the men-at-arms ;</l>
       <l n="30">Which suddenly would leap those stony walls</l>
       <l n="31">And spring up with loud laughter into trees .</l>
       <l n="32">I walked in busy streets where music oft</l>
       <l n="33">Went on the march with men ; and ofttimes heard</l>
       <l n="34">The organ in cathedral , when the boys</l>
       <l n="35">Like nightingales sang in that thunderstorm ;</l>
       <l n="36">The organ , with its rich and solemn tones —</l>
       <l n="37">As near a God 's voice as a man conceives ;</l>
       <l n="38">Nor ever dreamt the silent misery</l>
       <l n="39">That solemn organ brought to homeless men .</l>
       <l n="40">I heard the drums and soft brass instruments ,</l>
       <l n="41">Led by the silver cornets clear and high —</l>
       <l n="42">Whose sounds turned playing children into stones .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="43">I saw at night the City 's lights shine bright ,</l>
       <l n="44">A greater milky way ; how in its spell</l>
       <l n="45">It fascinated with ten thousand eyes ;</l>
       <l n="46">Like those sweet wiles of an enchantress who</l>
       <l n="47">Would still detain her knight gone cold in love ;</l>
       <l n="48">It was an iceberg with long arms unseen ,</l>
       <l n="49">That felt the deep for vessels far away .</l>
       <l n="50">All things seemed strange , I stared like any child</l>
       <l n="51">That pores on some old face and sees a world</l>
       <l n="52">Which its familiar granddad and his dame</l>
       <l n="53">Hid with their love and laughter until then .</l>
       <l n="54">My feet had not yet felt the cruel rocks</l>
       <l n="55">Beneath the pleasant moss I seemed to tread .</l>
       <l n="56">But soon my ears grew weary of that din ,</l>
       <l n="57">My eyes grew tired of all that flesh and stone ;</l>
       <l n="58">And , as a snail that crawls on a smooth stalk ,</l>
       <l n="59">Will reach the end and find a sharpened thorn —</l>
       <l n="60">So did I reach the cruel end at last .</l>
       <l n="61">I saw the starving mother and her child ,</l>
       <l n="62">Who feared that Death would surely end its sleep ,</l>
       <l n="63">And cursed the wolf of Hunger with her moans .</l>
       <l n="64">And yet , methought , when first I entered there ,</l>
       <l n="65">Into that city with my wondering mind ,</l>
       <l n="66">How marvellous its many sights and sounds ;</l>
       <l n="67">The traffic with its sound of heavy seas</l>
       <l n="68">That have and would again unseat the rocks .</l>
       <l n="69">How common then seemed Nature 's hills and fields</l>
       <l n="70">Compared with these high domes and even streets ,</l>
       <l n="71">And churches with white towers and bodies black .</l>
       <l n="72">The traffic 's sound was music to my ears ;</l>
       <l n="73">A sound of where the white waves , hour by hour ,</l>
       <l n="74">Attack a reef of coral rising yet ;</l>
       <l n="75">Or where a mighty warship in a fog ,</l>
       <l n="76">Steams into a large fleet of little boats .</l>
       <l n="77">Aye , and that fog was strange and wonderful ,</l>
       <l n="78">That made men blind and grope their way at noon .</l>
       <l n="79">I saw that City with fierce human surge ,</l>
       <l n="80">With millions of dark waves that still spread out</l>
       <l n="81">To swallow more of their green boundaries .</l>
       <l n="82">Then came a day that noise so stirred my soul ,</l>
       <l n="83">I called them hellish sounds , and thought red war</l>
       <l n="84">Was better far than peace in such a town .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="85">To hear that din all day , sometimes my mind</l>
       <l n="86">Went crazed , and it seemed strange , as I were lost</l>
       <l n="87">In some vast forest full of chattering apes .</l>
       <l n="88">How sick I grew to hear that lasting noise ,</l>
       <l n="89">And all those people forced across my sight ,</l>
       <l n="90">Knowing the acres of green fields and woods</l>
       <l n="91">That in some country parts outnumbered men ;</l>
       <l n="92">In half an hour ten thousand men I passed —</l>
       <l n="93">More than nine thousand should have been green trees .</l>
       <l n="94">There on a summer 's day I saw such crowds</l>
       <l n="95">That where there was no man man 's shadow was ;</l>
       <l n="96">Millions all cramped together in one hive ,</l>
       <l n="97">Storing , methought , more bitter stuff than sweet .</l>
       <l n="98">The air was foul and stale ; from their green homes</l>
       <l n="99">Young blood had brought its fresh and rosy cheeks ,</l>
       <l n="100">Which soon turned colour , like blue streams in flood .</l>
       <l n="101">Aye , solitude , black solitude indeed ,</l>
       <l n="102">To meet a million souls and know not one ;</l>
       <l n="103">This world must soon grow stale to one compelled</l>
       <l n="104">To look all day at faces strange and cold .</l>
       <l n="105">Oft full of smoke that town ; its summer 's day</l>
       <l n="106">Was darker than a summer 's night at sea ;</l>
       <l n="107">Poison was there , and still men rushed for it ,</l>
       <l n="108">Like cows for acorns that have made them sick .</l>
       <l n="109">That town was rich and old ; man 's flesh was cheap ,</l>
       <l n="110">But common earth was dear to buy one foot .</l>
       <l n="111">If I must be fenced in , then let my fence</l>
       <l n="112">Be some green hedgerow ; under its green sprays ,</l>
       <l n="113">That shake suspended , let me walk in joy —</l>
       <l n="114">As I do now , in these dear months I love .</l>
