       <l n="4">Let fall their costly thoughts , nor seem to know .—</l>
       <l n="5">Not mine the rich and showering hand , that strews</l>
       <l n="6">The facile largess of a stintless Muse .</l>
       <l n="7">A fitful presence , seldom tarrying long ,</l>
       <l n="8">Capriciously she touches me to song —</l>
       <l n="9">Then leaves me to lament her flight in vain ,</l>

       <l n="37">Thy ruinous bowers and drifted foliage wet —</l>
       <l n="38">Past and Future in sad bridal met ,</l>

      <head>TO EDWARD DOWDEN</head>
      <head>ON RECEIVING FROM HIM A COPY OF “ THE LIFE OF SHELLEY ”</head>
       <l n="1">First , ere I slake my hunger , let me thank</l>
       <l n="2">The giver of the feast . For feast it is ,</l>
       <l n="3">Though of ethereal , translunary fare —</l>
       <l n="4">His story who pre-eminently of men</l>
       <l n="5">Seemed nourished upon starbeams and the stuff</l>
       <l n="6">Of rainbows , and the tempest , and the foam ;</l>
       <l n="7">Who hardly brooked on his impatient soul</l>
       <l n="8">The fleshly trammels ; whom at last the sea</l>
       <l n="9">Gave to the fire , from whose wild arms the winds</l>
       <l n="10">Took him , and shook him broadcast to the world .</l>
       <l n="11">In my young days of fervid poesy</l>
       <l n="12">He drew me to him with his strange far light ,—</l>
       <l n="13">He held me in a world all clouds and gleams ,</l>
       <l n="14">And vasty phantoms , where ev'n Man himself</l>
       <l n="15">Moved like a phantom ‘ mid the clouds and gleams .</l>
       <l n="16">Anon the Earth recalled me , and a voice</l>
       <l n="17">Murmuring of dethroned divinities</l>
       <l n="18">And dead times deathless upon sculptured urn —</l>
       <l n="19">And Philomela 's long-descended pain</l>
       <l n="20">Flooding the night — and maidens of romance</l>
       <l n="21">To whom asleep St. Agnes ’ love-dreams come —</l>
       <l n="22">Awhile constrained me to a sweet duresse</l>
       <l n="23">And thraldom , lapping me in high content ,</l>
       <l n="24">Soft as the bondage of white amorous arms .</l>
       <l n="25">And then a third voice , long unheeded — held</l>
       <l n="26">Claustral and cold , and dissonant and tame —</l>
       <l n="27">Found me at last with ears to hear . It sang</l>
       <l n="28">Of lowly sorrows and familiar joys ,</l>
       <l n="29">Of simple manhood , artless womanhood ,</l>
       <l n="30">And childhood fragrant as the limpid morn ;</l>
       <l n="31">And from the homely matter nigh at hand</l>
       <l n="32">Ascending and dilating , it disclosed</l>
       <l n="33">Spaces and avenues , calm heights and breadths</l>
       <l n="34">Of vision , whence I saw each blade of grass</l>
       <l n="35">With roots that groped about eternity ,</l>
       <l n="36">And in each drop of dew upon each blade</l>
       <l n="37">The mirror of the inseparable All .</l>
       <l n="38">The first voice , then the second , in their turns</l>
       <l n="39">Had sung me captive . This voice sang me free .</l>
       <l n="40">Therefore , above all vocal sons of men ,</l>
       <l n="41">Since him whose sightless eyes saw hell and heaven ,</l>
       <l n="42">To Wordsworth be my homage , thanks , and love .</l>
       <l n="43">Yet dear is Keats , a lucid presence , great</l>
       <l n="44">With somewhat of a glorious soullessness .</l>
       <l n="45">And dear , and great with an excess of soul ,</l>
       <l n="46">Shelley , the hectic flamelike rose of verse ,</l>
       <l n="47">All colour , and all odour , and all bloom ,</l>
       <l n="48">Steeped in the noonlight , glutted with the sun ,</l>
       <l n="49">But somewhat lacking root in homely earth ,</l>
       <l n="50">Lacking such human moisture as bedews</l>
       <l n="51">His not less starward stem of song , who , rapt</l>
       <l n="52">Not less in glowing vision , yet retained</l>
       <l n="53">His clasp of the prehensible , retained</l>
       <l n="54">The warm touch of the world that lies to hand ,</l>
       <l n="55">Not in vague dreams of man forgetting men ,</l>
       <l n="56">Nor in vast morrows losing the to-day ;</l>
       <l n="57">Who trusted nature , trusted fate , nor found</l>
       <l n="58">An Ogre , sovereign on the throne of things ;</l>
       <l n="59">Who felt the incumbence of the unknown , yet bore</l>
       <l n="60">Without resentment the Divine reserve ;</l>
       <l n="61">Who suffered not his spirit to dash itself</l>
       <l n="62">Against the crags and wavelike break in spray ,</l>
       <l n="63">But ‘ midst the infinite tranquillities</l>
       <l n="64">Moved tranquil , and henceforth , by Rotha stream</l>
       <l n="65">And Rydal 's mountain-mirror , and where flows</l>
       <l n="66">Yarrow thrice sung or Duddon to the sea ,</l>
       <l n="67">And wheresoe'er man 's heart is thrilled by tones</l>
       <l n="68">Struck from man 's lyric heartstrings , shall survive .</l>

      <head>LACHRYMÆ MUSARUM</head>
      <head>( 6TH OCTOBER 1892 )</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Low , like another 's , lies the laurelled head :</l>
       <l n="2">The life that seemed a perfect song is o'er :</l>
       <l n="3">Carry the last great bard to his last bed .</l>
       <l n="4">Land that he loved , thy noblest voice is mute .</l>
       <l n="5">Land that he loved , that loved him ! nevermore</l>
       <l n="6">Meadow of thine , smooth lawn or wild sea-shore ,</l>
       <l n="7">Gardens of odorous bloom and tremulous fruit ,</l>
       <l n="8">Or woodlands old , like Druid couches spread ,</l>
       <l n="9">The master 's feet shall tread .</l>
       <l n="10">Death 's little rift hath rent the faultless lute :</l>
       <l n="11">The singer of undying songs is dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="12">Lo , in this season pensive-hued and grave ,</l>
       <l n="13">While fades and falls the doomed , reluctant leaf</l>
       <l n="14">From withered Earth 's fantastic coronal ,</l>
       <l n="15">With wandering sighs of forest and of wave</l>
       <l n="16">Mingles the murmur of a people 's grief</l>
       <l n="17">For him whose leaf shall fade not , neither fall .</l>
       <l n="18">He hath fared forth , beyond these suns and showers .</l>
       <l n="19">For us , the autumn glow , the autumn flame ,</l>
       <l n="20">And soon the winter silence shall be ours :</l>
       <l n="21">Him the eternal spring of fadeless fame</l>
       <l n="22">Crowns with no mortal flowers .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="23">Rapt though he be from us ,</l>
       <l n="24">Virgil salutes him , and Theocritus ;</l>
       <l n="25">Catullus , mightiest-brained Lucretius , each</l>
       <l n="26">Greets him , their brother , on the Stygian beach ;</l>
       <l n="27">Proudly a gaunt right hand doth Dante reach ;</l>
       <l n="28">Milton and Wordsworth bid him welcome home ;</l>
       <l n="29">Bright Keats to touch his raiment doth beseech ;</l>
       <l n="30">Coleridge , his locks aspersed with fairy foam ,</l>
       <l n="31">Calm Spenser , Chaucer suave ,</l>
       <l n="32">His equal friendship crave :</l>
       <l n="33">And godlike spirits hail him guest , in speech</l>
       <l n="34">Of Athens , Florence , Weimar , Stratford , Rome .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="35">What needs his laurel our ephemeral tears ,</l>
       <l n="36">To save from visitation of decay ?</l>
       <l n="37">Not in this temporal sunlight , now , that bay</l>
       <l n="38">Blooms , nor to perishable mundane ears</l>
       <l n="39">Sings he with lips of transitory clay ;</l>
       <l n="40">For he hath joined the chorus of his peers</l>
       <l n="41">In habitations of the perfect day :</l>
       <l n="42">His earthly notes a heavenly audience hears ,</l>
       <l n="43">And more melodious are henceforth the spheres ,</l>
       <l n="44">Enriched with music stol'n from earth away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="45">He hath returned to regions whence he came .</l>

       <l n="47">Of universal loveliness reclaim .</l>
       <l n="48">All nature is his shrine .</l>
       <l n="49">Seek him henceforward in the wind and sea ,</l>
       <l n="50">In earth 's and air 's emotion or repose ,</l>
       <l n="51">In every star 's august serenity ,</l>
       <l n="52">And in the rapture of the flaming rose .</l>
       <l n="53">There seek him if ye would not seek in vain ,</l>
       <l n="54">There , in the rhythm and music of the Whole ;</l>
       <l n="55">Yea , and for ever in the human soul</l>
       <l n="56">Made stronger and more beauteous by his strain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="57">For lo ! creation 's self is one great choir ,</l>
       <l n="58">And what is nature 's order but the rhyme</l>
       <l n="59">Whereto the worlds keep time ,</l>
       <l n="60">And all things move with all things from their prime ?</l>
       <l n="61">Who shall expound the mystery of the lyre ?</l>
       <l n="62">In far retreats of elemental mind</l>
       <l n="63">Obscurely comes and goes</l>
       <l n="64">The imperative breath of song , that as the wind</l>
       <l n="65">Is trackless , and oblivious whence it blows .</l>
       <l n="66">Demand of lilies wherefore they are white ,</l>
       <l n="67">Extort her crimson secret from the rose ,</l>
       <l n="68">But ask not of the Muse that she disclose</l>
       <l n="69">The meaning of the riddle of her might :</l>
       <l n="70">Somewhat of all things sealed and recondite ,</l>
       <l n="71">Save the enigma of herself , she knows .</l>
       <l n="72">The master could not tell , with all his lore ,</l>
       <l n="73">Wherefore he sang , or whence the mandate sped ;</l>
       <l n="74">Ev'n as the linnet sings , so I , he said ;—</l>
       <l n="75">Ah , rather as the imperial nightingale ,</l>
       <l n="76">That held in trance the ancient Attic shore ,</l>
       <l n="77">And charms the ages with the notes that o'er</l>
       <l n="78">All woodland chants immortally prevail !</l>
       <l n="79">And now , from our vain plaudits greatly fled ,</l>
       <l n="80">He with diviner silence dwells instead ,</l>
       <l n="81">And on no earthly sea with transient roar ,</l>
       <l n="82">Unto no earthly airs , he trims his sail ,</l>
       <l n="83">But far beyond our vision and our hail</l>
       <l n="84">Is heard for ever and is seen no more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="85">No more , O never now ,</l>
       <l n="86">Lord of the lofty and the tranquil brow</l>
       <l n="87">Whereon nor snows of time</l>
       <l n="88">Have fall'n , nor wintry rime ,</l>
       <l n="89">Shall men behold thee , sage and mage sublime .</l>
       <l n="90">Once , in his youth obscure ,</l>
       <l n="91">The maker of this verse , which shall endure</l>
       <l n="92">By splendour of its theme that cannot die ,</l>
       <l n="93">Beheld thee eye to eye ,</l>
       <l n="94">And touched through thee the hand</l>
       <l n="95">Of every hero of thy race divine ,</l>
       <l n="96">Ev'n to the sire of all the laurelled line ,</l>
       <l n="97">The sightless wanderer on the Ionian strand ,</l>
       <l n="98">With soul as healthful as the poignant brine ,</l>
       <l n="99">Wide as his skies and radiant as his seas ,</l>
       <l n="100">Starry from haunts of his Familiars nine ,</l>
       <l n="101">Glorious Mæonides .</l>
       <l n="102">Yea , I beheld thee , and behold thee yet :</l>
       <l n="103">Thou hast forgotten , but can I forget ?</l>
       <l n="104">The accents of thy pure and sovereign tongue ,</l>
       <l n="105">Are they not ever goldenly impressed</l>
       <l n="106">On memory 's palimpsest ?</l>
       <l n="107">I see the wizard locks like night that hung ,</l>
       <l n="108">I tread the floor thy hallowing feet have trod ;</l>
       <l n="109">I see the hands a nation 's lyre that strung ,</l>
       <l n="110">The eyes that looked through life and gazed on God .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="111">The seasons change , the winds they shift and veer ;</l>
       <l n="112">The grass of yesteryear</l>
       <l n="113">Is dead ; the birds depart , the groves decay :</l>
       <l n="114">Empires dissolve and peoples disappear :</l>
       <l n="115">Song passes not away .</l>
       <l n="116">Captains and conquerors leave a little dust ,</l>
       <l n="117">And kings a dubious legend of their reign ;</l>
       <l n="118">The swords of Cæsars , they are less than rust :</l>
       <l n="119">The poet doth remain .</l>
       <l n="120">Dead is Augustus , Maro is alive ;</l>
       <l n="121">And thou , the Mantuan of our age and clime ,</l>
       <l n="122">Like Virgil shalt thy race and tongue survive ,</l>
       <l n="123">Bequeathing no less honeyed words to time ,</l>
       <l n="124">Embalmed in amber of eternal rhyme ,</l>
       <l n="125">And rich with sweets from every Muse 's hive ;</l>
       <l n="126">While to the measure of the cosmic rune</l>
       <l n="127">For purer ears thou shalt thy lyre attune ,</l>
       <l n="128">And heed no more the hum of idle praise</l>
       <l n="129">In that great calm our tumults cannot reach ,</l>
       <l n="130">Master who crown'st our immelodious days</l>
       <l n="131">With flower of perfect speech .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="1">
        <l n="1">There was a time , it passeth me to say</l>
        <l n="2">How long ago , but sure ‘ twas many a day</l>
        <l n="3">Before the world had gotten her such store</l>
        <l n="4">Of foolish wisdom as she hath ,— before</l>
        <l n="5">She fell to waxing gray with weight of years</l>
        <l n="6">And knowledge , bitter knowledge , bought with tears ,—</l>
        <l n="7">When it did seem as if the feet of time</l>
        <l n="8">Moved to the music of a golden rhyme ,</l>
        <l n="9">And never one false thread might woven be</l>
        <l n="10">Athwart that web of worldwide melody .</l>
        <l n="11">‘ Twas then there lived a certain queen and king ,</l>
        <l n="12">Unvext of wars or other evil thing ,</l>
        <l n="13">Within a spacious palace builded high ,</l>
        <l n="14">Whence they might see their chiefest city lie</l>
        <l n="15">About them , and half hear from their tall towers</l>
        <l n="16">Its populous murmur through the daylight hours ,</l>
        <l n="17">And see beyond its walls the pleasant plain .</l>
        <l n="18">One child they had , these blissful royal twain :</l>
        <l n="19">Of whom ‘ tis told — so more than fair was he —</l>
        <l n="20">There lurked at whiles a something shadowy</l>
        <l n="21">Deep down within the fairness of his face ;</l>
        <l n="22">As ‘ twere a hint of some not-earthly grace ,</l>
        <l n="23">Making the royal stripling rather seem</l>
        <l n="24">The very dreaming offspring of a dream</l>
        <l n="25">Than human child of human ancestry :</l>
        <l n="26">And something strange-fantastical was he ,</l>
        <l n="27">I doubt not . Howsoever he upgrew ,</l>
        <l n="28">And after certain years to manhood drew</l>
        <l n="29">Nigh , so that all about his father 's court ,</l>
        <l n="30">Seeing his graciousness of princely port ,</l>
        <l n="31">Rejoiced thereat ; and many maidens ’ eyes</l>
        <l n="32">Look 'd pleased upon his beauty , and the sighs</l>
        <l n="33">Of many told I know not what sweet tales .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="2">
        <l n="34">So , like to some fair ship with sunlit sails ,</l>
        <l n="35">Glided his youth amid a stormless sea ,</l>
        <l n="36">Till once by night there came mysteriously</l>
        <l n="37">A fateful wind , and o'er an unknown deep</l>
        <l n="38">Bore him perforce . It chanced that while in sleep</l>
        <l n="39">He lay , there came to him a strange dim dream .</l>
        <l n="40">‘ Twas like as he did float adown a stream ,</l>
        <l n="41">In a lone boat that had nor sail nor oar</l>
        <l n="42">Yet seemed as it would glide for evermore ,</l>
        <l n="43">Deep in the bosom of a sultry land</l>
        <l n="44">Fair with all fairness . Upon either hand</l>
        <l n="45">Were hills green-browed and mist-engarlanded ,</l>
        <l n="46">And all about their feet were woods bespread ,</l>
        <l n="47">Hoarding the cool and leafy silentness</l>
        <l n="48">In many an unsunned hollow and hid recess .</l>
        <l n="49">Nought of unbeauteous might be there espied ;</l>
        <l n="50">But in the heart of the deep woods and wide ,</l>
        <l n="51">And in the heart of all , was Mystery —</l>
        <l n="52">A something more than outer eye might see ,</l>
        <l n="53">A something more than ever ear might hear .</l>
        <l n="54">The very birds that came and sang anear</l>
        <l n="55">Did seem to syllable some faery tongue ,</l>
        <l n="56">And , singing much , to hold yet more unsung .</l>
        <l n="57">And heard at whiles , with hollow wandering tone ,</l>
        <l n="58">Far off , as by some aery huntsmen blown ,</l>
        <l n="59">Faint-echoing horns , among the mountains wound ,</l>
        <l n="60">Made all the live air tremulous with sound .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="61">So hour by hour ( thus ran the Prince 's dream )</l>
        <l n="62">Glided the boat along the broadening stream ;</l>
        <l n="63">Till , being widowed of the sun her lord ,</l>
        <l n="64">The purblind day went groping evenward :</l>
        <l n="65">Whereafter Sleep compelled to his mild yoke</l>
        <l n="66">The bubbling clear souls of the feathered folk ,</l>
        <l n="67">Sealing the vital fountains of their song .</l>
        <l n="68">Howbeit the Prince went onward all night long</l>
        <l n="69">And never shade of languor came on him ,</l>

        <l n="869">Whereto the other answered , They had come</l>

        <l n="1596">This cloudy barrier stretching north and south ,</l>
        <l n="1597">A tale once told him by his mother 's mouth ,</l>
        <l n="1598">In childhood , while he sat upon her knee ,</l>
        <l n="1599">Rose to remembrance : how that on the sea .</l>
        <l n="1600">Sat somewhere a Great Mist which no sun 's heat</l>
        <l n="1601">Could melt , nor wind make wander from , its seat .</l>
        <l n="1602">So great it was , the fastest ship would need</l>
        <l n="1603">Seven days to compass it , with all her speed .</l>
        <l n="1604">And they of deepest lore and wisest wit</l>
        <l n="1605">Deemed that an island in the midst of it</l>
        <l n="1606">Bloomed like a rosebush ring 'd with snows , a place</l>
        <l n="1607">Of pleasance , folded in that white embrace</l>
        <l n="1608">And chill . But never yet would pilot steer</l>
        <l n="1609">Into the fog that wrapped it round , for fear</l>
        <l n="1610">Of running blindfold in that sightless mist</l>
        <l n="1611">On sunken reefs whereof no mariner wist :</l>
        <l n="1612">And so from all the world this happy isle</l>
        <l n="1613">Lay hidden . Thus the queen , long since ; and while</l>
        <l n="1614">He marvelled if the mist before his ken</l>
        <l n="1615">Could be the same she told of — even then ,</l>
        <l n="1616">Hardly a furlong ‘ fore the pinnace ’ prow</l>
        <l n="1617">It lay : and now ‘ twas hard at hand : and now</l>
        <l n="1618">The boat had swept into the folds of it !</l>
        <l n="1619">But all that vision of white darkness — lit</l>
        <l n="1620">By the full splendour of the emerald stone</l>
        <l n="1621">That from the forepart of the pinnace shone —</l>
        <l n="1622">Melted around her , as in sunder cleft</l>
        <l n="1623">By that strong spirit of light ; and there was left</l>
        <l n="1624">A wandering space , behind her and before ,</l>
        <l n="1625">Of radiance , roofed and walled with mist , the floor</l>
        <l n="1626">A liquid pavement large . And so she passed</l>
        <l n="1627">Through twilight immemorial , and at last</l>
        <l n="1628">Issued upon the other side , where lay</l>
        <l n="1629">The land no mortal knew before that day .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="83">

        <l n="1663">Entered upon a grassy vale and wide ,</l>

        <l n="1670">He wandered on , but had at whiles to ford</l>

       <l n="24">Unquenchable , that would not be put out .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="25">Albeit the lady Lucia 's bosom lacked</l>
       <l n="26">The ore had made her heart a richer mine</l>
       <l n="27">Than earth 's auriferous heart unsunned ; from her</l>
       <l n="28">Love went not out , in whom there was no love .</l>
       <l n="29">Cold from the first , her breast grew frore , and bit</l>
       <l n="30">Her kind lord 's bosom with its stinging frost .</l>
       <l n="31">Because he loved the fields and forests , made</l>
       <l n="32">Few banquetings for highborn winebibbers ,</l>
       <l n="33">Eschewed the city and led no sumptuous life ,</l>
       <l n="34">She , courtly , sneered at his uncourtliness ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="42">And so seven moons had waxed and waned since these</l>

       <l n="44">Lucia bespake her spouse in even more</l>
       <l n="45">Ungentle wise than was her wont , and he ,</l>
       <l n="46">For the first time , reproved her ;— not as one</l>
       <l n="47">That having from another ta'en ill words</l>
       <l n="48">Will e'en cry quits and barter words as ill ;</l>
       <l n="49">But liker as a father , whom his child</l>

       <l n="51">Less than he knows it had been wise to do ,</l>
       <l n="52">Saying within himself : “ The time will come</l>
       <l n="53">When thou wilt think on thy dead father , how</l>

       <l n="56">So shall thy heart rebuke thy heart enow : ” —</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="58">But though the words from his rough-bearded lips</l>
       <l n="59">Were like sweet water from the mouth of some</l>
       <l n="60">Rock-fountain hewn with elemental hands ,</l>
       <l n="61">They fell as water cast i ’ the fire , to be</l>
       <l n="62">Consumed with hissing rage . Her wrath , let loose ,</l>
       <l n="63">Blew to and fro , and hither and thither , like</l>
       <l n="64">A wind that seems to have forgotten whence</l>
       <l n="65">It came , and whither it was bidden blow .</l>
       <l n="66">She cursed the kinsfolk who had willed that she</l>
       <l n="67">Should wed with him ; and cursed herself that gave</l>
       <l n="68">Ear to the utterance of their will ; and cursed</l>
       <l n="69">The day on which their will became her deed :</l>
       <l n="70">Saying — and this he knew not until now —</l>
       <l n="71">“ Fool , I should ne'er have wedded thee at all ,</l>

       <l n="74">And he that hearkened , the Lord Angelo ,</l>
       <l n="75">Spake not a word , but bowed his head , and went</l>
       <l n="76">Forth of his castle to the forest nigh ,</l>
       <l n="77">And roamed all day about the forest , filled</l>
       <l n="78">With grief , and marvelling at her lack of love .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="79">But that which sorelier bruised his breast than ev'n</l>
       <l n="80">Lucia 's exceeding lack of love for him ,</l>
       <l n="81">Was this new knowledge , that in taking her</l>
       <l n="82">To wife — in the very act of taking her</l>
       <l n="83">To wife — himself had crossed the secret will</l>
       <l n="84">Of her whose will in all things it had been</l>
       <l n="85">His soul 's most perfect bliss to gratify .</l>
       <l n="86">Wherefore , to make atonement , in some sort ,</l>
       <l n="87">For this one wrong he deemed that he had done</l>
       <l n="88">The woman — this one crossing of her will —</l>
       <l n="89">He knelt him down under the brooding shade</l>
       <l n="90">Of a huge oak , and vowed ‘ fore heaven a vow :</l>
       <l n="91">To wit , that Lucia never afterward</l>
       <l n="92">Should in his hearing utter forth a wish</l>
       <l n="93">For aught of earthly but himself would see</l>
       <l n="94">That wish fulfilled , if such fulfilment were</l>
       <l n="95">An end that mortal man could compass . Then</l>
       <l n="96">Uprising , he beheld the sinking sun</l>
       <l n="97">A vast round eye gaze in upon the wood</l>
       <l n="98">Through leafy lattice of its nether boughs :</l>
       <l n="99">Whereat he turned him castlewards , and owned</l>
       <l n="100">A lighter heart than he had borne that day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="101">Homeward his face no sooner had he set</l>
       <l n="102">Than through the woods came riding unto him</l>
       <l n="103">A stranger , of a goodly personage ,</l>
       <l n="104">Young , and right richly habited , who stayed</l>
       <l n="105">His horse , and greeted Angelo , and said :</l>
       <l n="106">“ I pray you , sir , direct me how to find</l>
       <l n="107">An hostel , if there be such hereabouts ;</l>
       <l n="108">For I have ridden far , and lost my way</l>
       <l n="109">Among these woods , and twilight is at hand . ”</l>
       <l n="110">Then he that heard replied to him that asked ,</l>
       <l n="111">Saying : “ The nearest inn is farther hence</l>
       <l n="112">Than mine own house ; make therefore mine own house</l>
       <l n="113">Your inn for this one night , and unto such</l>
       <l n="114">Poor entertainment as my house affords</l>
       <l n="115">You are most welcome . ” So the stranger thanked</l>
       <l n="116">In courtly speeches the Lord Angelo ,</l>
       <l n="117">Gladly accepting hospitalities</l>
       <l n="118">That were so gladly proffered ; and the two</l>
       <l n="119">Fared on together , host and guest that were</l>
       <l n="120">To be , until they reached the castle , where</l>
       <l n="121">Angelo dwelt , and where his fathers lived</l>
       <l n="122">Before him , lords of land , in olden days .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="123">And entering in , the castle 's later lord</l>
       <l n="124">Led the young signor to the chamber where</l>
       <l n="125">The lady Lucia sat , who rose to give</l>
       <l n="126">The stranger courteous welcome . ( When she chose ,</l>
       <l n="127">Of looks and lips more gracious none than she . )</l>
       <l n="128">But soon as she beheld the young man 's face ,</l>
       <l n="129">A sudden pallor seized her own , and back</l>
       <l n="130">She started , wellnigh swooning , but regained</l>
       <l n="131">Her wonted self as suddenly , declared</l>
       <l n="132">‘ Twas but a momentary sickness went</l>
       <l n="133">Arrow-like through her , sharp , but therewithal</l>
       <l n="134">Brief as the breath 's one ebb and flow ; and which ,</l>
       <l n="135">Passing , had left her painless as before .</l>
       <l n="136">And truly , from that moment she appeared</l>
       <l n="137">More brightly beautiful , if Angelo</l>
       <l n="138">Erred not , than she had looked for many a day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="139">So in brief while the stranger-guest sat down ,</l>
       <l n="140">With host and hostess , to a table charged</l>
       <l n="141">With delicate meats , and fragrant fruits , and wine .</l>
       <l n="142">And when the meal was over , and themselves</l>
       <l n="143">Were with themselves alone — the serving-men</l>
       <l n="144">Having withdrawn — a cheerful converse rose</l>
       <l n="145">Concerning divers matters old and new .</l>
       <l n="146">And Angelo that evening let his tongue</l>
       <l n="147">Range more at freedom than he used ; for though</l>
       <l n="148">No man was less to prating given than he ,</l>
       <l n="149">Yet , when he liked his listener , he could make</l>
       <l n="150">His mouth discourse in such a wise that few</l>
       <l n="151">Had failed to give delighted audience .</l>
       <l n="152">For he had learning , and , besides the lore</l>
       <l n="153">Won from his books , a better wisdom owned —</l>
       <l n="154">A knowledge of the stuff whence books are made ,</l>
       <l n="155">The human mind and all it feeds upon .</l>
       <l n="156">And , in his youth a wanderer , he had roamed</l>
       <l n="157">O'er many countries , not as one who sees</l>
       <l n="158">With eyes alone , and hearkens but with ears ;</l>
       <l n="159">Rather as who would slake the thirst of the soul</l>
       <l n="160">By sucking wisdom from the breasts of the world .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="161">Wherefore the hours flew lightly , winged with words ;</l>
       <l n="162">Till Angelo , from telling of his own</l>
       <l n="163">Young days and early fortunes good and ill ,</l>
       <l n="164">Was with remembrance smitten , as it chanced ,</l>
       <l n="165">Of some old grief ‘ twas grief to think upon .</l>
       <l n="166">And so he changed his theme o ’ the sudden , donned</l>
       <l n="167">A shadowy mask of laboured pleasantry ,</l>
       <l n="168">And said : “ My wife , sir , hath a pretty gift</l>
       <l n="169">Of singing and of luting : it may be</l>
       <l n="170">If you should let your tongue turn mendicant —</l>
       <l n="171">Not for itself but for its needy kin ,</l>
       <l n="172">Your ears — she might be got to give an alms</l>
       <l n="173">For those twin brethren . ” Whereupon the guest</l>
       <l n="174">Unto his hostess turned and smiling said :</l>
       <l n="175">“ That were indeed a golden alms your voice</l>
       <l n="176">Could well afford , and never know itself</l>
       <l n="177">The poorer , being a mint of suchlike coin . ”</l>
       <l n="178">And she made answer archly : “ I have oft</l>
       <l n="179">Heard flatterers of a woman 's singing say</l>
       <l n="180">Her voice was silvery :— to compare ‘ t with gold</l>
       <l n="181">Is sure a new conceit . But , sir , you praise</l>
       <l n="182">My singing , who have not yet heard me sing . ”</l>
       <l n="183">And he : “ I take it that a woman 's speech</l>
       <l n="184">Is to her singing what a bird 's low chirp</l>
       <l n="185">Is to its singing : and if Philomel</l>
       <l n="186">Chirp in the hearing of the woodman , he</l>
       <l n="187">Knows ‘ tis the nightingale that chirps , and so</l>
       <l n="188">Expects nought meaner than its sovereign song .</l>
       <l n="189">Madam , ‘ tis thus your speaking-voice hath given</l>
       <l n="190">Earnest of what your singing-voice will be ;</l>
       <l n="191">And therefore I entreat you not to dash</l>
       <l n="192">The expectations you have raised so high ,</l>
       <l n="193">By your refusal . ” And she answered him :</l>
       <l n="194">“ Nay , if you think to hear a nightingale ,</l>
       <l n="195">I doubt refusal could not dash them more</l>
       <l n="196">Than will compliance . But in very truth ,</l>
       <l n="197">The boon you crave so small and worthless is ,</l>
       <l n="198">‘ Twere miserly to grudge it . Where 's my lute ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="199">So saying , she bethought her suddenly —</l>
       <l n="200">Or feigned to have bethought her suddenly —</l>
       <l n="201">How she had left the lute that afternoon</l>
       <l n="202">Lying upon an arbour-seat , when she</l>
       <l n="203">Grew tired of fingering the strings of it —</l>
       <l n="204">Down in the garden , where she wont to walk ,</l>
       <l n="205">Her lute loquacious to the trees ’ deaf trunks .</l>
       <l n="206">And Angelo , right glad to render her</l>
       <l n="207">Such little graceful offices of love ,</l>
       <l n="208">And gladder yet with hope to hear her sing</l>
       <l n="209">Who had denied his asking many a time ,</l>
       <l n="210">Awaited not another word , but rose</l>
       <l n="211">And said , “ Myself will bring it , ” and before</l>
       <l n="212">She could assent or disapprove , was gone .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="213">Scarce had he left the chamber when behold</l>
       <l n="214">His wife uprose , and his young stranger-guest</l>
       <l n="215">Uprose , and in a trice they cast their arms</l>
       <l n="216">About each other , kissed each other , called</l>
       <l n="217">Each other dear and love , till Lucia said :</l>

       <l n="222">Who 's gone a-questing for his true wife 's lute ? ”</l>
       <l n="223">And he made answer : “ I had come erenow ,</l>

       <l n="234">One only and the last ; until , to-day ,</l>

       <l n="243">The loyal subject of your sovereign heart ,</l>
       <l n="244">As in old days . ” Therewith he sat him down ,</l>
       <l n="245">And softly drawing her upon his knee</l>
       <l n="246">Made him a zone of her lascivious arms .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="247">But thus encinctured hardly had he sat</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="255">And listening to their speech a little space ,</l>
       <l n="256">The fugitive brief moments were to him</l>
       <l n="257">A pyramid of piled eternities .</l>
       <l n="258">For while he hearkened , Ugo said : “ My love ,</l>
       <l n="259">Answer me this one question , which may seem</l>
       <l n="260">Idle , yet is not ;— how much lov'st thou me ? ”</l>
       <l n="261">And she replied : “ I love thee just as much</l>
       <l n="262">As I do hate my husband , and no more . ”</l>
       <l n="263">Then he : “ But prithee how much hatest thou</l>
       <l n="264">Thy husband ? ” And she answered : “ Ev'n as much</l>
       <l n="265">As I love thee . To hate him one whit more</l>
       <l n="266">Than that , were past the power of Lucia 's hate . ”</l>
       <l n="267">And Ugo : “ If thou lovest me so much ,</l>
       <l n="268">Grant me one gift in token of thy love . ”</l>
       <l n="269">Then she : “ What would'st thou ? ” And he answered her :</l>
       <l n="270">“ Even thyself ; no poorer gift will I . ”</l>
       <l n="271">But Lucia said : “ Nay , have I not bestowed</l>
       <l n="272">My love , which is my soul , my richer self ?</l>
       <l n="273">My poorer self , which is my body , how</l>

       <l n="277">Yet — but I know not ... if I grant this boon ,</l>
       <l n="278">Bethink thee , how wilt carry hence the gift ?</l>
       <l n="279">Quick . For the time is all-too brief to waste . ”</l>
       <l n="280">And Ugo spake with hurrying tongue : “ Right so :</l>
       <l n="281">To-morrow , therefore , when the sun hath set ,</l>
       <l n="282">Quit thou the castle , all alone , and haste</l>
       <l n="283">To yonder tarn that lies amid the trees</l>
       <l n="284">Haply a furlong westward from your house —</l>
       <l n="285">The gloomy lakelet fringed with pines — and there</l>
       <l n="286">Upon the hither margin thou shalt find</l>
       <l n="287">Me , and two with me , mounted all , and armed ,</l>
       <l n="288">With a fourth steed to bear thee on his back :</l>
       <l n="289">And thou shalt fly with me , my Lucia , till</l>

       <l n="7">And vague foregloomings of the Dark to be ,</l>
       <l n="8">Close like a sadness round his glimmering way ;</l>
       <l n="9">So I , from drifting dreambound on and on</l>
       <l n="10">About strange isles of utter bliss , in seas</l>
       <l n="11">Whose waves are unimagined melodies ,</l>
       <l n="12">Rose and beheld the dreamless world anew :</l>
       <l n="13">Sad were the fields , and dim with splendours gone</l>
       <l n="14">The strait sky-glimpses fugitive and few .</l>

       <l n="1">O Master , if immortals suffer aught</l>
       <l n="2">Of sadness like to ours , and in like sighs</l>
       <l n="3">And with like overflow of darkened eyes</l>
       <l n="4">Disburden them , I know not ; but methought ,</l>
       <l n="5">What time to day mine ear the utterance caught</l>
       <l n="6">Whereby in manifold melodious wise</l>
       <l n="7">Thy heart 's unrestful infelicities</l>
       <l n="8">Rose like a sea with easeless winds distraught ,</l>
       <l n="9">That thine seemed angel 's grieving , as of one</l>
       <l n="10">Strayed somewhere out of heaven , and uttering</l>
       <l n="11">Lone moan and alien wail : because he hath</l>
       <l n="12">Failed to remember the remounting path ,</l>
       <l n="13">And singing , weeping , can but weep and sing</l>
       <l n="14">Ever , through vasts forgotten of the sun .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">God-seeking thou hast journeyed far and nigh .</l>
       <l n="2">On dawn-lit mountain-tops thy soul did yearn</l>
       <l n="3">To hear His trailing garments wander by ;</l>
       <l n="4">And where ‘ mid thunderous glooms great sunsets burn ,</l>
       <l n="5">Vainly thou sought'st His shadow on sea and sky ;</l>
       <l n="6">Or gazing up , at noontide , could'st discern</l>
       <l n="7">Only a neutral heaven 's indifferent eye</l>
       <l n="8">And countenance austerely taciturn .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Yet whom thou soughtest I have found at last ;</l>
       <l n="10">Neither where tempest dims the world below</l>
       <l n="11">Nor where the westering daylight reels aghast</l>
       <l n="12">In conflagrations of red overthrow :</l>
       <l n="13">But where this virgin brooklet silvers past ,</l>
       <l n="14">And yellowing either bank the king-cups blow .</l>

       <l n="7">Ev'n as a rushlight down the gulfs afar ,</l>
