    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh , East is East , and West is West , and never the twain shall meet ,</l>
     <l n="2">Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God 's great Judgment Seat ;</l>
     <l n="3">But there is neither East nor West , Border , nor Breed , nor Birth ,</l>
     <l n="4">When two strong men stand face to face ,</l>
     <l n="5">tho ’ they come from the ends of the earth !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side ,</l>
     <l n="7">And he has lifted the Colonel 's mare that is the Colonel 's pride :</l>
     <l n="8">He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day ,</l>
     <l n="9">And turned the calkins upon her feet , and ridden her far away .</l>
     <l n="10">Then up and spoke the Colonel 's son that led a troop of the Guides :</l>
     <l n="11">“ Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides ? ”</l>
     <l n="12">Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan , the son of the Ressaldar :</l>
     <l n="13">“ If ye know the track of the morning-mist , ye know where his pickets are .</l>
     <l n="14">At dusk he harries the Abazai — at dawn he is into Bonair ,</l>
     <l n="15">But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare ,</l>
     <l n="16">So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly ,</l>
     <l n="17">By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai .</l>
     <l n="18">But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai , right swiftly turn ye then ,</l>
     <l n="19">For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal 's men .</l>
     <l n="20">There is rock to the left , and rock to the right , and low lean thorn between ,</l>
     <l n="21">And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen . ”</l>
     <l n="22">The Colonel 's son has taken a horse , and a raw rough dun was he ,</l>
     <l n="23">With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell</l>
     <l n="24">and the head of the gallows-tree .</l>
     <l n="25">The Colonel 's son to the Fort has won , they bid him stay to eat —</l>
     <l n="26">Who rides at the tail of a Border thief , he sits not long at his meat .</l>
     <l n="27">He 's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly ,</l>
     <l n="28">Till he was aware of his father 's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai ,</l>
     <l n="29">Till he was aware of his father 's mare with Kamal upon her back ,</l>
     <l n="30">And when he could spy the white of her eye , he made the pistol crack .</l>
     <l n="31">He has fired once , he has fired twice , but the whistling ball went wide .</l>
     <l n="32">“ Ye shoot like a soldier , ” Kamal said . “ Show now if ye can ride . ”</l>
     <l n="33">It 's up and over the Tongue of Jagai , as blown dustdevils go ,</l>
     <l n="34">The dun he fled like a stag of ten , but the mare like a barren doe .</l>
     <l n="35">The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above ,</l>
     <l n="36">But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars , as a maiden plays with a glove .</l>
     <l n="37">There was rock to the left and rock to the right , and low lean thorn between ,</l>
     <l n="38">And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho ’ never a man was seen .</l>
     <l n="39">They have ridden the low moon out of the sky , their hoofs drum up the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="40">The dun he went like a wounded bull , but the mare like a new-roused fawn .</l>
     <l n="41">The dun he fell at a water-course — in a woful heap fell he ,</l>
     <l n="42">And Kamal has turned the red mare back , and pulled the rider free .</l>
     <l n="43">He has knocked the pistol out of his hand — small room was there to strive ,</l>
     <l n="44">“ ‘ Twas only by favour of mine , ” quoth he , “ ye rode so long alive :</l>
     <l n="45">There was not a rock for twenty mile , there was not a clump of tree ,</l>
     <l n="46">But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee .</l>
     <l n="47">If I had raised my bridle-hand , as I have held it low ,</l>
     <l n="48">The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row :</l>
     <l n="49">If I had bowed my head on my breast , as I have held it high ,</l>
     <l n="50">The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly . ”</l>
     <l n="51">Lightly answered the Colonel 's son : “ Do good to bird and beast ,</l>
     <l n="52">But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast .</l>
     <l n="53">If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away ,</l>
     <l n="54">Belike the price of a jackal 's meal were more than a thief could pay .</l>
     <l n="55">They will feed their horse on the standing crop ,</l>
     <l n="56">their men on the garnered grain ,</l>
     <l n="57">The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain .</l>
     <l n="58">But if thou thinkest the price be fair , — thy brethren wait to sup ,</l>
     <l n="59">The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn , — howl , dog , and call them up !</l>
     <l n="60">And if thou thinkest the price be high , in steer and gear and stack ,</l>
     <l n="61">Give me my father 's mare again , and I 'll fight my own way back ! ”</l>
     <l n="62">Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet .</l>
     <l n="63">“ No talk shall be of dogs , ” said he , “ when wolf and gray wolf meet .</l>
     <l n="64">May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath ;</l>
     <l n="65">What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death ? ”</l>
     <l n="66">Lightly answered the Colonel 's son : “ I hold by the blood of my clan :</l>
     <l n="67">Take up the mare for my father 's gift — by God , she has carried a man ! ”</l>
     <l n="68">The red mare ran to the Colonel 's son , and nuzzled against his breast ;</l>
     <l n="69">“ We be two strong men , ” said Kamal then , “ but she loveth the younger best .</l>
     <l n="70">So she shall go with a lifter 's dower , my turquoise-studded rein ,</l>
     <l n="71">My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth , and silver stirrups twain . ”</l>
     <l n="72">The Colonel 's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end ,</l>
     <l n="73">“ Ye have taken the one from a foe , ” said he ;</l>
     <l n="74">“ will ye take the mate from a friend ? ”</l>
     <l n="75">“ A gift for a gift , ” said Kamal straight ; “ a limb for the risk of a limb .</l>
     <l n="76">Thy father has sent his son to me , I 'll send my son to him ! ”</l>
     <l n="77">With that he whistled his only son , that dropped from a mountain-crest —</l>
     <l n="78">He trod the ling like a buck in spring , and he looked like a lance in rest .</l>
     <l n="79">“ Now here is thy master , ” Kamal said , “ who leads a troop of the Guides ,</l>
     <l n="80">And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides .</l>
     <l n="81">Till Death or I cut loose the tie , at camp and board and bed ,</l>
     <l n="82">Thy life is his — thy fate it is to guard him with thy head .</l>
     <l n="83">So , thou must eat the White Queen 's meat , and all her foes are thine ,</l>
     <l n="84">And thou must harry thy father 's hold for the peace of the Border-line ,</l>
     <l n="85">And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power —</l>
     <l n="86">Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="87">They have looked each other between the eyes , and there they found no fault ,</l>
     <l n="88">They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt :</l>
     <l n="89">They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod ,</l>
     <l n="90">On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife , and the Wondrous Names of God .</l>
     <l n="91">The Colonel 's son he rides the mare and Kamal 's boy the dun ,</l>
     <l n="92">And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one .</l>
     <l n="93">And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard , full twenty swords flew clear —</l>
     <l n="94">There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer .</l>
     <l n="95">“ Ha ’ done ! ha ’ done ! ” said the Colonel 's son .</l>
     <l n="96">“ Put up the steel at your sides !</l>
     <l n="97">Last night ye had struck at a Border thief —</l>

    <head>THE LAST SUTTEE</head>
    <head>Not many years ago a King died in one of the Rajpoot States . His wives , disregarding the orders of the English against Suttee , would have broken out of the palace had not the gates been barred . But one of them , disguised as the King 's favourite dancing-girl , passed through the line of guards and reached the pyre . There , her courage failing , she prayed her cousin , a baron of the court , to kill her . This he did , not knowing who she was .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="4">For the soul of the dying Rajpoot King ,</l>
     <l n="5">All night beat up from the women 's wing</l>
     <l n="6">A cry that we could not still .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">All night the barons came and went ,</l>
     <l n="8">The lords of the outer guard :</l>

     <l n="10">On Ulwar sabre and Tonk jezail ,</l>
     <l n="11">Mewar headstall and Marwar mail ,</l>
     <l n="12">That clinked in the palace yard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">In the Golden room on the palace roof</l>
     <l n="14">All night he fought for air :</l>
     <l n="15">And there was sobbing behind the screen ,</l>
     <l n="16">Rustle and whisper of women unseen ,</l>
     <l n="17">And the hungry eyes of the Boondi Queen</l>
     <l n="18">On the death she might not share .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">He passed at dawn — the death-fire leaped</l>
     <l n="20">From ridge to river-head ,</l>
     <l n="21">From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars :</l>
     <l n="22">And wail upon wail went up to the stars</l>

     <l n="31">We drove the great gates home apace :</l>

     <l n="52">And kissed the ground where her feet had trod ,</l>

    <head>THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This ballad appears to refer to one of the exploits of the notorious</l>
     <l n="2">Paul Jones , the American pirate . It is founded on fact .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">. . . At the close of a winter day ,</l>
     <l n="4">Their anchors down , by London town , the Three Great Captains lay ;</l>
     <l n="5">And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye ,</l>
     <l n="6">And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby ,</l>
     <l n="7">And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall ,</l>
     <l n="8">And he was Captain of the Fleet — the bravest of them all .</l>
     <l n="9">Their good guns guarded their great gray sides</l>
     <l n="10">that were thirty foot in the sheer ,</l>
     <l n="11">When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer .</l>
     <l n="12">Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze ,</l>
     <l n="13">Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas .</l>
     <l n="14">Light she rode in the rude tide-rip , to left and right she rolled ,</l>
     <l n="15">And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold .</l>
     <l n="16">“ I ha ’ paid Port dues for your Law , ” quoth he , “ and where is the Law ye boast</l>
     <l n="17">If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast ?</l>
     <l n="18">Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk ,</l>
     <l n="19">We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Pei-ho junk ;</l>
     <l n="20">I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare</l>
     <l n="21">Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre .</l>
     <l n="22">There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore ,</l>
     <l n="23">And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore .</l>
     <l n="24">He would not fly the Rovers ’ flag — the bloody or the black ,</l>
     <l n="25">But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack .</l>
     <l n="26">He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew — he swore it was only a loan ;</l>
     <l n="27">But when I would ask for my own again , he swore it was none of my own .</l>
     <l n="28">He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line ,</l>
     <l n="29">He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine ;</l>
     <l n="30">He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas ,</l>
     <l n="31">He has taken my grinning heathen gods — and what should he want o ’ these ?</l>
     <l n="32">My foremast would not mend his boom , my deckhouse patch his boats ;</l>
     <l n="33">He has whittled the two , this Yank Yahoo , to peddle for shoe-peg oats .</l>
     <l n="34">I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside ,</l>
     <l n="35">But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied .</l>
     <l n="36">Had I had guns ( as I had goods ) to work my Christian harm ,</l>
     <l n="37">I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm ;</l>
     <l n="38">I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head , and ripped them off with a saw ,</l>
     <l n="39">And soused them in the bilgewater , and served them to him raw ;</l>
     <l n="40">I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark ,</l>
     <l n="41">I had towed him aft of his own craft , a bait for his brother shark ;</l>
     <l n="42">I had lapped him round with cocoa husk , and drenched him with the oil ,</l>
     <l n="43">And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil ;</l>
     <l n="44">I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side ,</l>
     <l n="45">and tasselled his beard i ’ the mesh ,</l>
     <l n="46">And spitted his crew on the live bamboo</l>
     <l n="47">that grows through the gangrened flesh ;</l>
     <l n="48">I had hove him down by the mangroves brown ,</l>
     <l n="49">where the mud-reef sucks and draws ,</l>
     <l n="50">Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab 's claws !</l>
     <l n="51">He is lazar within and lime without , ye can nose him far enow ,</l>
     <l n="52">For he carries the taint of a musky ship — the reek of the slaver 's dhow ! ”</l>
     <l n="53">The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold ,</l>
     <l n="54">And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold ,</l>
     <l n="55">And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt : —</l>
     <l n="56">“ Good Sir , we ha ’ dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut .</l>
     <l n="57">Your words be words of a lawless race , and the Law it standeth thus :</l>
     <l n="58">He comes of a race that have never a Law , and he never has boarded us .</l>
     <l n="59">We ha ’ sold him canvas and rope and spar — we know that his price is fair ,</l>
     <l n="60">And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre .</l>
     <l n="61">And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you ,</l>
     <l n="62">We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true . ”</l>
     <l n="63">The skipper called to the tall taffrail : — “ And what is that to me ?</l>
     <l n="64">Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three ?</l>
     <l n="65">Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o ’ the Line ?</l>
     <l n="66">He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine .</l>
     <l n="67">There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in ,</l>
     <l n="68">But we do not steal the niggers ’ meal , for that is a nigger 's sin .</l>
     <l n="69">Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw , or laid in brass on his wheel ?</l>
     <l n="70">Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers ?</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Fore Gad , then , why does he steal ? ”</l>
     <l n="72">The skipper bit on a deep-sea word , and the word it was not sweet ,</l>
     <l n="73">For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet .</l>
     <l n="74">But three and two , in white and blue , the whimpering flags began : —</l>
     <l n="75">“ We have heard a tale of a — foreign sail , but he is a merchantman . ”</l>
     <l n="76">The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon : —</l>
     <l n="77">“ ‘ Fore Gad , the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air : —</l>
     <l n="79">“ We have sold our spars to the merchantman — we know that his price is fair . ”</l>
     <l n="80">The skipper winked his Western eye , and swore by a China storm : —</l>
     <l n="81">“ They ha ’ rigged him a Joseph 's jury-coat to keep his honour warm . ”</l>
     <l n="82">The halliards twanged against the tops , the bunting bellied broad ,</l>
     <l n="83">The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord .</l>
     <l n="84">Masthead — masthead , the signal sped by the line o ’ the British craft ;</l>
     <l n="85">The skipper called to his Lascar crew , and put her about and laughed : —</l>
     <l n="86">“ It 's mainsail haul , my bully boys all — we 'll out to the seas again —</l>
     <l n="87">Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint , or scrub at his grapnel-chain .</l>
     <l n="88">It 's fore-sheet free , with her head to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="89">and the swing of the unbought brine —</l>
     <l n="90">We 'll make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o ’ the Line :</l>
     <l n="91">Till we come as a ship o ’ the Line , my lads , of thirty foot in the sheer ,</l>
     <l n="92">Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer ;</l>
     <l n="93">Flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of Admiralty ,</l>
     <l n="94">Heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea .</l>
     <l n="95">Then fore-sheet home as she lifts to the foam — we stand on the outward tack ,</l>
     <l n="96">We are paid in the coin of the white man 's trade —</l>
     <l n="97">the bezant is hard , ay , and black .</l>
     <l n="98">The frigate-bird shall carry my word to the Kling and the Orang-Laut</l>
     <l n="99">How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port ;</l>
     <l n="100">How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there</l>
     <l n="101">Shall dip their flag to a slaver 's rag — to show that his trade is fair ! ”</l>

     <l n="8">Seven days and seven nights to the Start we drifted .</l>
     <l n="9">Racketing her rivets loose , smoke-stack white as snow ,</l>
     <l n="10">All the coals adrift adeck , half the rails below ,</l>
     <l n="11">Leaking like a lobster-pot , steering like a dray —</l>

     <l n="15">Met a blow that laid us down , heard a bulkhead fly ;</l>
     <l n="16">Left the Wolf behind us with a two-foot list to port .</l>
     <l n="17">Trailing like a wounded duck , working out her soul ;</l>
     <l n="18">Clanging like a smithy-shop after every roll ;</l>
     <l n="19">Just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray —</l>
     <l n="20">So we threshed the Bolivar out across the Bay !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">‘ Felt her hog and felt her sag , betted when she 'd break ;</l>

     <l n="23">Heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake ;</l>
     <l n="24">Hoped the Lord ‘ ud keep his thumb on the plummer-block .</l>
     <l n="25">Banged against the iron decks , bilges choked with coal ;</l>
     <l n="26">Flayed and frozen foot and hand , sick of heart and soul ;</l>
     <l n="27">Last we prayed she 'd buck herself into judgment Day —</l>
     <l n="28">Hi ! we cursed the Bolivar knocking round the Bay !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">O her nose flung up to sky , groaning to be still —</l>
     <l n="30">Up and down and back we went , never time for breath ;</l>
     <l n="31">Then the money paid at Lloyd 's caught her by the heel ,</l>
     <l n="32">And the stars ran round and round dancin ’ at our death .</l>
     <l n="33">Aching for an hour 's sleep , dozing off between ;</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green ;</l>
     <l n="35">‘ Watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play —</l>
     <l n="36">That was on the Bolivar , south across the Bay .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="37">Once we saw between the squalls , lyin ’ head to swell —</l>

     <l n="40">Cheered her from the Bolivar swampin ’ in the sea .</l>
     <l n="41">Then a grayback cleared us out , then the skipper laughed ;</l>

     <l n="12">With the shafts he most abhorred ;</l>

    <head>THE CONUNDRUM OF THE WORKSHOPS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Eden 's green and gold ,</l>
     <l n="2">Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mould ;</l>
     <l n="3">And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Wherefore he called to his wife , and fled to fashion his work anew —</l>
     <l n="6">The first of his race who cared a fig for the first , most dread review ;</l>
     <l n="7">And he left his lore to the use of his sons — and that was a glorious gain</l>
     <l n="8">When the Devil chuckled “ Is it Art ? ” in the ear of the branded Cain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">They fought and they talked in the North and the South ,</l>

     <l n="16">The stone was dropped at the quarry-side and the idle derrick swung ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">The tale is as old as the Eden Tree — and new as the new-cut tooth —</l>
     <l n="19">For each man knows ere his lip-thatch grows he is master of Art and Truth ;</l>
     <l n="20">And each man hears as the twilight nears , to the beat of his dying heart ,</l>
     <l n="21">The Devil drum on the darkened pane : “ You did it , but was it Art ? ”</l>

     <l n="26">When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the Club-room 's green and gold ,</l>

     <l n="28">They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves ,</l>
     <l n="29">and the ink and the anguish start ,</l>

     <l n="31">Now , if we could win to the Eden Tree where the Four Great Rivers flow ,</l>
     <l n="32">And the Wreath of Eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago ,</l>

     <l n="1">Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in Berkeley Square ,</l>

     <l n="3">A Spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till he heard as the roar of a rain-fed ford the roar of the Milky Way :</l>
     <l n="5">Till he heard the roar of the Milky Way die down and drone and cease ,</l>
     <l n="6">And they came to the Gate within the Wall where Peter holds the keys .</l>
     <l n="7">“ Stand up , stand up now , Tomlinson , and answer loud and high</l>

     <l n="9">The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone ! ”</l>
     <l n="10">And the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rain-washed bone .</l>
     <l n="11">“ O I have a friend on earth , ” he said , “ that was my priest and guide ,</l>

     <l n="18">Then Tomlinson looked up and down , and little gain was there ,</l>
     <l n="19">For the naked stars grinned overhead , and he saw that his soul was bare :</l>
     <l n="20">The Wind that blows between the worlds , it cut him like a knife ,</l>
     <l n="21">And Tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life .</l>
     <l n="22">“ This I have read in a book , ” he said , “ and that was told to me ,</l>
     <l n="23">And this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in Muscovy . ”</l>
     <l n="24">The good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path ,</l>
     <l n="25">And Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath .</l>

     <l n="30">For the Darkness stayed at his shoulder-blade and Heaven 's Gate before : —</l>
     <l n="31">“ O this I have felt , and this I have guessed , and this I have heard men say ,</l>
     <l n="32">And this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in Norroway . ”</l>
     <l n="33">— “ Ye have read , ye have felt , ye have guessed , good lack !</l>

     <l n="48">in the Scorn of the Outer Dark .</l>
     <l n="49">The Wind that blows between the worlds , it nipped him to the bone ,</l>
     <l n="50">And he yearned to the flare of Hell-Gate</l>
     <l n="51">there as the light of his own hearth-stone .</l>
     <l n="52">The Devil he sat behind the bars , where the desperate legions drew ,</l>

     <l n="60">And Tomlinson looked up and up , and saw against the night</l>
     <l n="61">The belly of a tortured star blood-red in Hell-Mouth light ;</l>
     <l n="62">And Tomlinson looked down and down , and saw beneath his feet</l>
     <l n="63">The frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in Hell-Mouth heat .</l>
     <l n="64">“ O I had a love on earth , ” said he , “ that kissed me to my fall ,</l>
     <l n="65">And if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all . ”</l>
     <l n="66">— “ All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair ,</l>
     <l n="67">But now ye wait at Hell-Mouth Gate and not in Berkeley Square :</l>
     <l n="68">Though we whistled your love from her bed to-night , I trow she would not run ,</l>
     <l n="69">For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one ! ”</l>
     <l n="70">The Wind that blows between the worlds , it cut him like a knife ,</l>
     <l n="71">And Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life : —</l>
     <l n="72">“ Once I ha ’ laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the Grave ,</l>
     <l n="73">And thrice I ha ’ patted my God on the head that men might call me brave . ”</l>
     <l n="74">The Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool : —</l>
     <l n="75">“ Do ye think I would waste my good pit-coal on the hide of a brain-sick fool ?</l>
     <l n="76">I see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did</l>
     <l n="77">That I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid . ”</l>
     <l n="78">Then Tomlinson looked back and forth , and there was little grace ,</l>
     <l n="79">For Hell-Gate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked Space .</l>
     <l n="80">“ Nay , this I ha ’ heard , ” quo ’ Tomlinson , “ and this was noised abroad ,</l>
     <l n="81">And this I ha ’ got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord . ”</l>
     <l n="82">— “ Ye ha ’ heard , ye ha ’ read , ye ha ’ got , good lack !</l>
     <l n="83">and the tale begins afresh —</l>
     <l n="84">Have ye sinned one sin for the pride o ’ the eye</l>
     <l n="85">or the sinful lust of the flesh ? ”</l>
     <l n="86">Then Tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered , “ Let me in —</l>
     <l n="87">For I mind that I borrowed my neighbour 's wife to sin the deadly sin . ”</l>
     <l n="88">The Devil he grinned behind the bars , and banked the fires high :</l>
     <l n="89">“ Did ye read of that sin in a book ? ” said he ; and Tomlinson said , “ Ay ! ”</l>
     <l n="90">The Devil he blew upon his nails , and the little devils ran ,</l>
     <l n="91">And he said : “ Go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man :</l>
     <l n="92">Winnow him out ‘ twixt star and star , and sieve his proper worth :</l>
     <l n="93">There 's sore decline in Adam 's line if this be spawn of earth . ”</l>
     <l n="94">Empusa 's crew , so naked-new they may not face the fire ,</l>
     <l n="95">But weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire ,</l>
     <l n="96">Over the coal they chased the Soul , and racked it all abroad ,</l>
     <l n="97">As children rifle a caddis-case or the raven 's foolish hoard .</l>
     <l n="98">And back they came with the tattered Thing , as children after play ,</l>
     <l n="99">And they said : “ The soul that he got from God he has bartered clean away .</l>
     <l n="100">We have threshed a stook of print and book , and winnowed a chattering wind</l>
     <l n="101">And many a soul wherefrom he stole , but his we cannot find :</l>
     <l n="102">We have handled him , we have dandled him , we have seared him to the bone ,</l>
     <l n="103">And sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own . ”</l>
     <l n="104">The Devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low : —</l>
     <l n="105">“ I 'm all o'erhYpppHeNsib to Adam 's breed that I should bid him go .</l>
     <l n="106">Yet close we lie , and deep we lie , and if I gave him place ,</l>
     <l n="107">My gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face ;</l>
     <l n="108">They 'd call my house a common stews and me a careless host ,</l>
     <l n="109">And — I would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost . ”</l>
     <l n="110">The Devil he looked at the mangled Soul that prayed to feel the flame ,</l>
     <l n="111">And he thought of Holy Charity , but he thought of his own good name : —</l>
     <l n="112">“ Now ye could haste my coal to waste , and sit ye down to fry :</l>
     <l n="113">Did ye think of that theft for yourself ? ” said he ; and Tomlinson said , “ Ay ! ”</l>
     <l n="114">The Devil he blew an outward breath , for his heart was free from care : —</l>
     <l n="115">“ Ye have scarce the soul of a louse , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="116">“ but the roots of sin are there ,</l>
     <l n="117">And for that sin should ye come in were I the lord alone .</l>
     <l n="118">But sinful pride has rule inside — and mightier than my own .</l>
     <l n="119">Honour and Wit , fore-damned they sit , to each his priest and whore :</l>
     <l n="120">Nay , scarce I dare myself go there , and you they 'd torture sore .</l>
     <l n="121">Ye are neither spirit nor spirk , ” he said ; “ ye are neither book nor brute —</l>
     <l n="122">Go , get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of Man 's repute .</l>
     <l n="123">I 'm all o'erhYpppHeNsib to Adam 's breed that I should mock your pain ,</l>
     <l n="124">But look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again .</l>
     <l n="125">Get hence , the hearse is at your door — the grim black stallions wait —</l>
     <l n="126">They bear your clay to place to-day . Speed , lest ye come too late !</l>
     <l n="127">Go back to Earth with a lip unsealed — go back with an open eye ,</l>
     <l n="128">And carry my word to the Sons of Men or ever ye come to die :</l>
     <l n="129">That the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one —</l>

     <l n="1">Mine was the woman to me , darkling I found her ;</l>
     <l n="2">Haling her dumb from the camp , took her and bound her .</l>
     <l n="3">Hot rose her tribe on our track ere I had proved her ;</l>
     <l n="4">Hearing her laugh in the gloom , greatly I loved her .</l>

     <l n="5">Swift through the forest we ran ; none stood to guard us ,</l>

     <l n="7">Him we call Son of the Sea , sullen and swollen .</l>
     <l n="8">Panting we waited the death , stealer and stolen .</l>

     <l n="9">Yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter ,</l>
     <l n="10">Lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water ;</l>
     <l n="11">Holding on high and apart skins that arrayed her ,</l>
     <l n="12">Called she the God of the Wind that He should aid her .</l>

     <l n="19">Whisper there was not , nor word , shadow nor showing ,</l>
     <l n="20">Till the light stirred on the deep , glowing and growing .</l>

     <l n="21">Then did He leap to His place flaring from under ,</l>
     <l n="22">He the Compeller , the Sun , bared to our wonder .</l>
     <l n="23">Nay , not a league from our eyes blinded with gazing ,</l>
     <l n="24">Cleared He the gate of the world , huge and amazing !</l>

     <l n="25">This we beheld ( and we live ) — the Pit of the Burning !</l>
     <l n="26">Then the God spoke to the tree for our returning ;</l>
     <l n="27">Back to the beach of our flight , fearless and slowly ,</l>
     <l n="28">Back to our slayers went he : but we were holy .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Men that were hot in that hunt , women that followed ,</l>
     <l n="30">Babes that were promised our bones , trembled and wallowed :</l>

     <l n="32">Prophet and priestess we came back from the dawning !</l>

     <l n="20">The great man-seal haul out of the sea , a-roaring , band by band ;</l>

     <l n="22">The great man-seal haul back to the sea and no man knows their path .</l>

     <l n="38">There were fifteen hundred skins abeach , cool pelt and proper fur ,</l>
     <l n="39">When the Northern Light drove into the bight</l>

     <l n="41">The Baltic called her men and weighed — she could not choose but run —</l>

     <l n="47">They had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear ,</l>
     <l n="48">When they were aware of a sloop-of-war , ghost-white and very near .</l>

     <l n="28">When we bought half shares in a cheap ‘ un and hoisted a flag of our own .</l>
     <l n="29">Patching and coaling on credit , and living the Lord knew how ,</l>
     <l n="30">We started the Red Ox freighters — we 've eight-and-thirty now .</l>
     <l n="31">And those were the days of clippers , and the freights were clipper-freights ,</l>
     <l n="32">And we knew we were making our fortune , but she died in Macassar Straits —</l>
     <l n="33">By the Little Paternosters , as you come to the Union Bank —</l>
     <l n="34">And we dropped her in fourteen fathom ; I pricked it off where she sank .</l>
     <l n="35">Owners we were , full owners , and the boat was christened for her ,</l>
     <l n="36">And she died in the Mary Gloster . My heart , how young we were !</l>
     <l n="37">So I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore ,</l>
     <l n="38">But your mother came and warned me and I would n't liquor no more :</l>
     <l n="39">Strict I stuck to my business , afraid to stop or I 'd think ,</l>
     <l n="40">Saving the money ( she warned me ) , and letting the other men drink .</l>
     <l n="41">And I met M'Cullough in London ( I 'd turned five ‘ undred then ) ,</l>
     <l n="42">And ‘ tween us we started the Foundry — three forges and twenty men :</l>
     <l n="43">Cheap repairs for the cheap ‘ uns . It paid , and the business grew ,</l>
     <l n="44">For I bought me a steam-lathe patent , and that was a gold mine too .</l>
     <l n="45">“ Cheaper to build ‘ em than buy ‘ em , ” I said , but M'Cullough he shied ,</l>
     <l n="46">And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde .</l>
     <l n="47">And the Lines were all beginning , and we all of us started fair ,</l>
     <l n="48">Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square .</l>
     <l n="49">But M'Cullough ‘ e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all ,</l>
     <l n="50">And Brussels an ’ Utrecht velvet , and baths and a Social Hall ,</l>
     <l n="51">And pipes for closets all over , and cutting the frames too light ,</l>
     <l n="52">But M'Cullough he died in the Sixties , and — Well , I 'm dying to-night . . . .</l>
     <l n="53">I knew — I knew what was coming , when we bid on the Byfleet 's keel —</l>
     <l n="54">They piddled and piffled with iron : I 'd given my orders for steel !</l>
     <l n="55">Steel and the first expansions . It paid , I tell you , it paid ,</l>
     <l n="56">When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade !</l>
     <l n="57">And they asked me how I did it , and I gave ‘ em the Scripture text ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ You keep your light so shining a little in front o ’ the next ! ”</l>
     <l n="59">They copied all they could follow , but they could n't copy my mind ,</l>
     <l n="60">And I left ‘ em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind .</l>
     <l n="61">Then came the armour-contracts , but that was M'Cullough ' s side ;</l>
     <l n="62">He was always best in the Foundry , but better , perhaps , he died .</l>
     <l n="63">I went through his private papers ; the notes was plainer than print ;</l>
     <l n="64">And I 'm no fool to finish if a man 'll give me a hint .</l>
     <l n="65">( I remember his widow was angry . ) So I saw what the drawings meant ,</l>
     <l n="66">And I started the six-inch rollers , and it paid me sixty per cent —</l>
     <l n="67">Sixty per cent with failures , and more than twice we could do ,</l>
     <l n="68">And a quarter-million to credit , and I saved it all for you !</l>
     <l n="69">I thought — it does n't matter — you seemed to favour your ma ,</l>

     <l n="95">There 's women will say I 've married a second time .</l>
     <l n="96">Not quite ! But give pore Aggie a hundred , and tell her your lawyers 'll fight .</l>
     <l n="97">She was the best o ’ the boiling — you 'll meet her before it ends ;</l>

     <l n="116">And they 'll want to send me to Woking ; and that 's where you 'll earn your pay .</l>
     <l n="117">I 've thought it out on the quiet , the same as it ought to be done —</l>
     <l n="118">Quiet , and decent , and proper — an ’ here 's your orders , my son .</l>
     <l n="119">You know the Line ? You do n't , though . You write to the Board , and tell</l>

     <l n="121">An ’ you 'd like the Mary Gloster — I 've held her ready for this —</l>
     <l n="122">They 'll put her in working order and you 'll take her out as she is .</l>
     <l n="123">Yes , it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside</l>
     <l n="124">( Thank God , I can pay for my fancies ! ) — the boat where your mother died ,</l>
     <l n="125">By the Little Paternosters , as you come to the Union Bank ,</l>
     <l n="126">We dropped her — I think I told you — and I pricked it off where she sank —</l>

     <l n="129">Easy bearings to carry — three South — three to the dot ;</l>
     <l n="130">But I gave M'Andrew a copy in case of dying — or not .</l>
     <l n="131">And so you 'll write to M'Andrew , he 's Chief of the Maori Line ;</l>
     <l n="132">They 'll give him leave , if you ask ‘ em and say it 's business o ’ mine .</l>
     <l n="133">I built three boats for the Maoris , an ’ very well pleased they were ,</l>
     <l n="134">An ’ I 've known Mac since the Fifties , and Mac knew me — and her .</l>
     <l n="135">After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep</l>
     <l n="136">Against the time you 'd claim it , committin ’ your dad to the deep ;</l>
     <l n="137">For you are the son o ’ my body , and Mac was my oldest friend ,</l>
     <l n="138">I 've never asked ‘ im to dinner , but he 'll see it out to the end .</l>
     <l n="139">Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar , I 've heard he 's prayed for my soul ,</l>
     <l n="140">But he could n't lie if you paid him , and he 'd starve before he stole !</l>
     <l n="141">He 'll take the Mary in ballast — you 'll find her a lively ship ;</l>
     <l n="142">And you 'll take Sir Anthony Gloster , that goes on ‘ is wedding-trip ,</l>
     <l n="143">Lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide ,</l>
     <l n="144">The kick o ’ the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside !</l>
     <l n="145">Sir Anthony Gloster 's carriage — our ‘ ouse-flag flyin ’ free —</l>
     <l n="146">Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea !</l>
     <l n="147">He made himself and a million , but this world is a fleetin ’ show ,</l>
     <l n="148">And he 'll go to the wife of ‘ is bosom the same as he ought to go —</l>
     <l n="149">By the heel of the Paternosters — there is n't a chance to mistake —</l>
     <l n="150">And Mac 'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break !</l>
     <l n="151">Five thousand for six weeks ’ cruising , the staunchest freighter afloat ,</l>
     <l n="152">And Mac he 'll give you your bonus the minute I 'm out o ’ the boat !</l>
     <l n="153">He 'll take you round to Macassar , and you 'll come back alone ;</l>
     <l n="154">He knows what I want o ’ the Mary . . . . I 'll do what I please with my own .</l>
     <l n="155">Your mother ‘ ud call it wasteful , but I 've seven-and-thirty more ;</l>
     <l n="156">I 'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door . . . .</l>
     <l n="157">For my son ‘ e was never a credit : ‘ e muddled with books and art ,</l>
     <l n="158">And ‘ e lived on Sir Anthony 's money and ‘ e broke Sir Anthony 's heart .</l>
     <l n="159">There is n't even a grandchild , and the Gloster family 's done —</l>

     <l n="164">That first stroke come for a warning ; I ought to ha ’ gone to you then ,</l>
     <l n="165">But — cheap repairs for a cheap ‘ un — the doctors said I 'd do :</l>
     <l n="166">Mary , why did n't you warn me ? I 've allus heeded to you ,</l>
     <l n="167">Excep ’ — I know — about women ; but you are a spirit now ;</l>
     <l n="168">An ’ , wife , they was only women , and I was a man . That 's how .</l>
     <l n="169">An ’ a man ‘ e must go with a woman , as you could not understand ;</l>
     <l n="170">But I never talked ‘ em secrets . I paid ‘ em out o ’ hand .</l>
     <l n="171">Thank Gawd , I can pay for my fancies ! Now what 's five thousand to me ,</l>
     <l n="172">For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be ?</l>
     <l n="173">I believe in the Resurrection , if I read my Bible plain ,</l>
     <l n="174">But I would n't trust ‘ em at Wokin ’ ; we 're safer at sea again .</l>
     <l n="175">For the heart it shall go with the treasure — go down to the sea in ships .</l>
     <l n="176">I 'm sick of the hired women — I 'll kiss my girl on her lips !</l>
     <l n="177">I 'll be content with my fountain , I 'll drink from my own well ,</l>
     <l n="178">And the wife of my youth shall charm me — an ’ the rest can go to Hell !</l>
     <l n="179">( Dickie , he will , that 's certain . ) I 'll lie in our standin ’ - bed ,</l>
     <l n="180">An ’ Mac 'll take her in ballast — an ’ she trims best by the head . . . .</l>
     <l n="181">Down by the head an ’ sinkin ’ , her fires are drawn and cold ,</l>
     <l n="182">And the water 's splashin ’ hollow on the skin of the empty hold —</l>
     <l n="183">Churning an ’ choking and chuckling , quiet and scummy and dark —</l>
     <l n="184">Full to her lower hatches and risin ’ steady . Hark !</l>
     <l n="185">That was the after-bulkhead . . . . She 's flooded from stem to stern . . . .</l>
