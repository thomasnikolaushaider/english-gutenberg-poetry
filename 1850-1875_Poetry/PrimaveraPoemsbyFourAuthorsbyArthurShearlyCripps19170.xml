    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Primavera : Poems , by Four Authors . Oxford : Published by B. H. Blackwell , Broad Street . MDCCCXC . ( Fcap 8vo , pp . 43 . )</p>
    <p n="2">Such is the title of a little ‘ book of verses ’ that at the time found favour in the eyes of a few discerning critics , and then , apparently , was forgotten . As originally issued its dark brown paper wrapper was adorned with a simple but effective woodcut design by Mr. Selwyn Image , which we have reproduced on our first half-title . Even more fortunate has been the discovery of a signed review in the pages of the Academy for August 9 , 1890 , by the late John Addington Symonds . As a preface nothing could be better . And in this connexion the lines which we prefix from Guarini are also singularly appropriate . For these songs of Youth are still worth while ; they thrill and fill us as of yesterday with their haunting sense of vanished love , of</p>
    <p n="3">‘ Joy , whose hand is ever at his lips Bidding adieu . ’</p>
    <p n="4">PREFACE</p>
    <p n="5">This little book was written by four friends , three of them under-graduates at Oxford , and all of them penetrated with the spirit of the higher culture of our time . The poems , it is clear , have been carefully selected ; and , it is probable , have been diligently polished . There is not one which is not remarkable for delicacy of style and conscious aiming after excellence in art . Whether these qualities promise well for future achievement and development is a question open to debate . But there can be no doubt that in Primavera we possess another of those tiny verse-books like Ionica , or Mr. Percy Pinkerton 's Galeazzo , which will not lose in freshness and in perfume as the years go by .</p>
    <p n="6">The poems have the distinction of making one wish to be acquainted with their authors . Though they differ a good deal in mental tone , perhaps also somewhat in literary merit , they possess marked common characteristics : a restrained refinement , a subdued reserve , a gentle melancholy ; the note of the latest Anglican æsthetic school . We find no humour , no Sturm und Drang , no inequalities and incoherences of passion . Even where it is obvious that the emotion has been intense , possibly of a rare and peculiar strain , as in Mr. Binyon 's “ Testamentum Amoris ” and Mr. Phillips 's “ To a Lost Love , ” the expression of it obeys no violence of impulse . A tender tone of regret , rather than of acute grief , steeps these stanzas ( to quote one instance ) addressed to a friend removed into the spiritual world by death .</p>
    <p n="7">“ Oh , thou art cold ! In that high sphere Thou art a thing apart , Losing in saner happiness This madness of the heart .</p>
    <p n="8">“ And yet , at times , thou still shalt feel A passing breath , a pain ; Disturb 'd , as though a door in heaven Had oped and closed again .</p>
    <p n="9">“ And thou shalt shiver , while the hymns , The solemn hymns , shall cease ; A moment half remember me ; Then turn away to peace . ”</p>
    <p n="10">It would be invidious to institute critical comparisons between the styles of these four friends and their respective merits . It may , however , be remarked that Mr. Manmohan Ghose 's work possesses a peculiar interest on account of its really notable command of the subtleties of English prosody and diction , combined with just a touch of foreign feeling . The artful employment of imperfect rhymes in “ Raymond and Ida ” illustrates what I mean . Occasionally , too , Mr. Ghose produces exactly the right phrase by means of a felicitous simplicity . Notice the line which I have italicised in the following stanza :</p>
    <p n="11">“ In the deep West the heavens grow heavenlier , Eve after eve ; and still The glorious stars remember to appear ; The roses on the hill Are fragrant as before ; Only thy face , of all that 's dear , I shall see nevermore ! ”</p>
    <p n="12">Take , again , these two lines :</p>
    <p n="13">“ Forget the shining of the stars , forget The vernal visitation of the rose . ”</p>
    <p n="14">There is but one piece of blank verse in the book . This prologue to “ Orestes , ” by Mr. Stephen Phillips , has strength , is firm in outline , somewhat tardy in movement , fit for sonorous declamation . The gravity which I have indicated as a ruling quality of all these youthful compositions makes itself felt here in its proper place . We might have wished , perhaps , for more of joyous accent in the ode to “ Youth , ” by Mr. Laurence Binyon , which dwells less on the rapture of youth than on its sadness — the melancholy of Theognis over youth 's decay :</p>
    <p n="15">“ O bright new-comer , filled with thoughts of joy , Joy to be thine amid these pleasant plains , Know'st thou not , child , what surely coming pains Await thee , for that eager heart 's annoy ? Misunderstanding , disappointment , tears , Wronged love , spoiled hope , mistrust and ageing fears , Eternal longing for one perfect friend , And unavailing wishes without end ? ”</p>
    <p n="16">Mr. Cripps alone permits his Muse a gravely jocund note in his “ Seasons ’ Comfort . ” He , too , of the four fellow-versifiers shows the greater aptitude for experiments , though it may perhaps be felt that his touch is nowhere quite so sure , nor his artistic feeling so direct as theirs .</p>
    <p n="17">It is difficult to lay the critic 's hand lightly enough upon poems like these , or to make it clear what particular attraction they possess . With all the charm of rathe spring-flowers , they suggest the possibilities of varied personality not yet accentuated in the authors . Let us hope that the four Muses of the four friends will not , like the primroses ,</p>
    <p n="18">“ die unmarried ere they can behold Bright Phoebus in his strength , ”</p>
    <p n="19">but that we shall profit by their summer-songs , while ever remaining grateful for their Primavera .</p>

     <l n="1">No Muse will I invoke ; for she is fled !</l>
     <l n="2">Lo ! where she sits , breathing , yet all but dead .</l>
     <l n="3">She loved the heavens of old , she thought them fair ;</l>
     <l n="4">And dream 'd of Gods in Tempe 's golden air .</l>
     <l n="5">For her the wind had voice , the sea its cry ;</l>
     <l n="6">She deem 'd heroic Greece could never die .</l>
     <l n="7">Breathless was she , to think what nymphs might play</l>
     <l n="8">In clear green depths , deep-shaded from the day ;</l>
     <l n="9">She thought the dim and inarticulate god</l>
     <l n="10">Was beautiful , nor knew she man a sod ;</l>
     <l n="11">But hoped what seem 'd might not be all untrue ,</l>
     <l n="12">And feared to look beyond the eternal blue .</l>
     <l n="13">But now the heavens are bared of dreams divine .</l>
     <l n="14">Still murmurs she , like Autumn , This was mine !</l>
     <l n="15">How should she face the ghastly , jarring Truth ,</l>
     <l n="16">That questions all , and tramples without ruth ?</l>
     <l n="17">And still she clings to Ida of her dreams ,</l>
     <l n="18">And sobs , Ah ! let the world be what it seems !</l>
     <l n="19">Then the shy nymph shall softly come again ;</l>
     <l n="20">The world , once more , make music for her pain .</l>
     <l n="21">For , sitting in the dim and ghostly night ,</l>
     <l n="22">She fain would stay the strong approach of light ;</l>
     <l n="23">While later bards cleave to her , and believe</l>
     <l n="24">That in her sorrow she can still conceive !</l>
     <l n="25">Oh , let her dream ; still lovely is her sigh ;</l>
     <l n="26">Oh , rouse her not , or she shall surely die .</l>

     <l n="1">When life begins anew ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Youth , from gathering flowers ,</l>
     <l n="3">From vague delights , rapt musings , twilight hours ,</l>
     <l n="4">Turns restless , seeking some great deed to do ,</l>
     <l n="5">To sum his foster 'd dreams ; when that fresh birth</l>
     <l n="6">Unveils the real , the throng 'd and spacious Earth ,</l>
     <l n="7">And he awakes to those more ample skies ,</l>
     <l n="8">By other aims and by new powers possess 'd :</l>
     <l n="9">How deeply , then , his breast</l>
     <l n="10">Is fill 'd with pangs of longing ! how his eyes</l>
     <l n="11">Drink in the enchanted prospect ! Fair it lies</l>
     <l n="12">Before him , with its plains expanding vast ,</l>
     <l n="13">Peopled with visions , and enrich 'd with dreams ;</l>
     <l n="14">Dim cities , ancient forests , winding streams ,</l>
     <l n="15">Places resounding in the famous past ,</l>
     <l n="16">A kingdom ready to his hand !</l>
     <l n="17">How like a bride Life seems to stand</l>
     <l n="18">In welcome , and with festal robes array 'd !</l>
     <l n="19">He feels her loveliness pervade</l>
     <l n="20">And pierce him with inexplicable sweetness ;</l>
     <l n="21">And , in her smiles delighting , and the fires</l>
     <l n="22">Of his own pulses , passionate soul !</l>
     <l n="23">Measures his strength by his desires ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the wide future by their fleetness ,</l>
     <l n="25">As his thought leaps to the long-distant goal .</l>

     <l n="29">Death , and the fabled impotence of man ?</l>
     <l n="30">Already , in his marching dream ,</l>
     <l n="31">Men at his sun-like coming seem</l>
     <l n="32">As with an inspiration stirr 'd , and he</l>
     <l n="33">To kindle with new thoughts degenerate nations ,</l>
     <l n="34">In sordid cares immersed so long ;</l>
     <l n="35">Thrill 'd with ethereal exultations</l>
     <l n="36">And a victorious expectancy ,</l>
     <l n="37">Even such as swell 'd the breasts of Bacchus ’ throng ,</l>
     <l n="38">When that triumphal burst of joy was hurl 'd</l>

     <l n="44">Beautiful Bacchus , ivy-crown 'd , his hair</l>
     <l n="45">Blown on the wind , and flush 'd limbs bare ,</l>
     <l n="46">And lips apart , and radiant eyes ,</l>
     <l n="47">And ears that caught the coming melodies ,</l>
     <l n="48">As wave on wave of revellers swept abroad ;</l>
     <l n="49">Wreathed with vine-leaves , shouting , trampling onwards ,</l>

     <l n="1">‘ Tis my twentieth year : dim , now , youth stretches behind me ;</l>

     <l n="9">Not more restless the boy , whose eager , confident bosom</l>
     <l n="10">The wide , unknown sea fills with a hunger to roam .</l>
     <l n="11">Often beside the surge of the desolate ocean he paces ;</l>
     <l n="12">Ingrate , dreams of a sky brighter , serener than his .</l>
     <l n="13">Passionate soul ! light holds he a mother 's tearful entreaties ,</l>

     <l n="3">At length have leisure for her steadfast voice ,</l>
     <l n="4">That gathers peace from the great deeps of hell .</l>
     <l n="5">She call 'd me , saying : ‘ I heard a cry by night !</l>

     <l n="7">My will awaits fulfilment . Lo , the dead</l>

     <l n="9">Seek not to justify thyself : in me</l>
     <l n="10">Be strong , and I will show thee wise in time ;</l>

     <l n="14">They walked with Wisdom , though they knew her not . ’</l>
     <l n="15">So sped I home ; and from the under-world</l>
     <l n="16">Forever came a wind that fill 'd my sails ,</l>
     <l n="17">Cold , like a spirit ! and ever her still voice</l>
     <l n="18">Spoke over shoreless seas and fathomless deeps ,</l>
     <l n="19">And in great calms , as from a colder world ;</l>
     <l n="20">Nor slack 'd I sail by day , nor yet when night</l>
     <l n="21">Fell on my running keel , and now would burn ,</l>
     <l n="22">With all her eyes , my errand into me .</l>
     <l n="23">So sped I on , fill 'd with a voice divine :</l>
     <l n="24">And hardly wist I whom I was to slay ,</l>
     <l n="25">My mother ! but a vague , heroic dream</l>
     <l n="26">Possess 'd me ; fired to do the will of gods ,</l>
     <l n="27">I lost the man in minister of Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="28">Nor took I note of sandbank , nor of storm ,</l>
     <l n="29">Nor of the ocean 's thunders , when the shores</l>
     <l n="30">All round had faded , leaving me alone :</l>
     <l n="31">I knew I could not die , till I had slain !</l>
     <l n="32">But , when I came once more upon the land</l>
     <l n="33">That rear 'd me , all the sweetness of old days</l>
     <l n="34">Came back on me : I stood , as from a dream</l>
     <l n="35">Waked to a sudden , sad reality .</l>
     <l n="36">And when , far off , I saw those ancient towers ,</l>
     <l n="37">The palaces and places of my youth ,</l>
     <l n="38">I long 'd to fall into my mother 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="39">And tell a thousand tales of near escapes .</l>
     <l n="40">And lo ! the nurse , that fondled me of yore ,</l>
     <l n="41">Fell with glad tears upon my neck , and told</l>
     <l n="42">How she , and how my mother , all this while</l>
     <l n="43">Had dream 'd of all I was to do , and said</l>
     <l n="44">How dear I should be to my mother 's eyes .</l>
     <l n="45">Her words shook me , but shook not my resolve .</l>
     <l n="46">For even then there came that sterner voice ,</l>
     <l n="47">Echoing to what was highest in the soul .</l>
     <l n="48">Then , like to those who have a work on earth ,</l>
     <l n="49">And put far from them lips of wife or child ,</l>
     <l n="50">And gird them to the accomplishment ; so I</l>
     <l n="51">Strode in , nor saw at all mine ancient halls ;</l>
     <l n="52">And struck my father 's murderess , not my mother .</l>
     <l n="53">And , when I had smitten , lo , the strength of gods</l>
     <l n="54">Pass 'd from me , and the old , familiar halls</l>
     <l n="55">Reel 'd back on me ; dim statues , that of old</l>
     <l n="56">Holding my mother 's hand I marvell 'd at ,</l>
     <l n="57">And questioned her of each . And she lies there ,</l>
     <l n="58">My mother ! ay , my mother now ; O hair</l>
     <l n="59">That once I play 'd with in these halls ! O eyes</l>
     <l n="60">That for a moment knew me as I came ,</l>
     <l n="61">And lighten 'd up , and trembled into love ;</l>
     <l n="62">The next were darkened by my hand ! Ah me !</l>
     <l n="63">Ye will not look upon me in that world .</l>
     <l n="64">Yet thou , perchance , art happier , if thou go'st</l>
     <l n="65">Into some land of wind and drifting leaves ,</l>
     <l n="66">To sleep without a star ; but as for me ,</l>
     <l n="67">Hell hungers , and the restless Furies wait .</l>
     <l n="68">Then the dark Curse , that sits upon the towers ,</l>
     <l n="69">Bow 'd down her awful head , thus satisfied ,</l>
     <l n="70">And I fled forth , a murderer , through the world .</l>
