     <head>PRELIMINARY INFORMATION</head>
     <p>Over the hills and far away lies Arcady , the Mecca of all Lovers , and therefore the place where Journeys End . Situated on a large tract of enchanted ground , in the Country of Agapemone , Arcady is a beautiful and interesting place , and should be visited by every tourist making the Grand Tour of Life .</p>
     <p>Even the shortest sojourn here will yield rich rewards of interest and pleasure , and will contribute more than long years of study to a thorough enjoyment and comprehension of all that is best in life .</p>
     <p>The majority of the human race sooner or later find Arcady for themselves , some seeking it with a steadfast purpose , others blindly stumbling into it all unexpectedly .</p>
     <p>But to the traveler who would enjoy intelligently its delights , the following hints may not come amiss .</p>

      <head>TOPOGRAPHY</head>
      <head>The Province of Arcadia , whose capital is Arcady ( see map No . 1 ) , is bounded on the North by the Land of Heart ’ s Desire , from which it is separated by the Happy Valley .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">On the East it is bounded by the Gulf of Time , across which dimly may be</l>
       <l n="2">seen , in the distance , the Garden of Eden .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">On the West by the Mountains of Opposition , beyond which is the Gulf of</l>
       <l n="4">Dark Despair .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Along the Southern Shores murmur the lapping wavelets of the Sea of Dreams , whose wonderful phenomenon of Mirage often deceives even an experienced traveler .</p>
     <p>ROUTES : Travelers may approach Arcady by several routes . One of the pleasantest is the Joy Line , by which passengers are carried across the Sea of Dreams in Transports of Rapture .</p>
     <figure>
      <p>“ ACROSS THE SEA OF DREAMS IN TRANSPORTS OF RAPTURE ”</p>
     </figure>
     <p>Another approach , preferred by adventurous ones in search of excitement , is across the Seas of Misunderstanding , through the troubled waters of the Gulf of Wo , and over the difficult and well-nigh impassable Mountains of Opposition . However , when these mountains are safely crossed the way is delightful and easy .</p>
     <figure>
      <p>“ THE TROUBLED WATERS OF THE GULF OF WO ”</p>
     </figure>
     <p>ROADS OUT OF ARCADY : The Road to Fame often leads out of Arcady . An ambitious youth , hearing a silvery trumpet note , looks up to see a radiant Goddess beckoning to him . Unless a true Lover , he may be dazzled by her glory and cajoled by her promises . Lured away , he follows the fickle Fair and soon loses all interest in Arcadian delights .</p>
     <figure>
      <p>Illustration</p>
     </figure>
     <p>The Road to Wealth is another easy way out of Arcady . Not content with the Pot of Gold at the End of the Rainbow , many with a greed for lucre will follow the Goddess Fortune , who is even more false and fickle than the Goddess Fame .</p>
     <figure>
      <p>“ A RADIANT GODDESS BECKONING TO HIM ”</p>
     </figure>
     <p>Also there is the Downward Path , which leads from the State of Matrimony to the Great Divide . Crossing this , the unfortunate traveler returns to the State of Single Blessedness .</p>
     <figure>
      <p>“ MANY WITH A GREED FOR LUCRE WILL FOLLOW THE GODDESS FORTUNE ”</p>
     </figure>
     <p>SEASON : Arcady is an all-the-year-round resort , and most of the districts described may be visited at any season of the year . Spring and Early Summer are perhaps best for an initial visit .</p>
     <p>June is an especially desirable time for young lovers to be in Arcady , but Lovelorn Swains and Minor Poets frequently choose the melancholy days of Autumn .</p>
     <p>CLIMATE : The Climatic conditions of Arcady are peculiar . Though usually the weather is balmy and pleasant , sometimes a sudden coolness springs up and a frost is often distinctly felt . A stormy time may ensue , and then suddenly the clouds clear away and all is sunshine once more .</p>
     <p>TIME : Time in Arcady is entirely a matter of opinion . To a waiting Lover the minutes are hours and lag slowly along , while to happy hearts a golden day flies by as if on wings .</p>
     <p>It is said that Love makes Time pass away , and Time makes Love pass away ; but the latter statement is obviously an error , for after Love has made Time pass away , how can Time do anything to Love ?</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">However , ’ tis Love that makes the world go round , and this explains why</l>
       <l n="2">Love makes Time pass so rapidly .</l>

       <l n="5">“ FOREVER ——— NEVER</l>
       <l n="6">NEVER ——— FOREVER ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Watches are of little use in Arcady , as the Lovers deem them always too slow or too fast , and usually forget to wind them , anyway . The town timepiece is the Old Clock on the Stairs , whose refrain is :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Forever — Never —</l>
       <l n="2">Never — Forever —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Forever and Never are the units of time most employed by Arcadians , and</l>
       <l n="4">their meanings are synonymous .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Time when Lovers are separated is measured by ages ; when together , it is not measured at all , as then the hours unheeded fly , or speed on winged feet .</p>
     <p>Sun dials and Moon dials are approved , as they mark the bright hours only .</p>

      <head>TIME ’ S VALENTINE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">’ Twas St. Valentine ’ s Day , and Father Time</l>
       <l n="2">Said , “ I think I ’ ll scribble a bit o ’ rhyme ,</l>
       <l n="3">To send to the sweetest maid on earth .”</l>
       <l n="4">And the old fellow chuckled in roguish mirth .</l>
       <l n="5">He reached for his inkhorn and quill , then said ,</l>
       <l n="6">As he absently nodded his wise old head ,</l>
       <l n="7">“ But what maiden is gentle and sweet and fine</l>
       <l n="8">Enough to be my Valentine ?</l>
       <l n="9">There ’ s a musical girl in Kalamazoo ,—</l>
       <l n="10">But I hear she beats Time , so she won ’ t do ;</l>
       <l n="11">There ’ s a fair New York girl , proud and calm ,</l>
       <l n="12">But they say she kills Time without a qualm !</l>

       <l n="14">But ‘ I won ’ t have Time ,’ I heard her say .</l>

       <l n="16">But they declare they ‘ have Time to burn .’</l>
       <l n="17">There are lovely girls in a Southern clime ,</l>
       <l n="18">But they sweetly admit that they waste Time ,</l>
       <l n="19">While the bustling woman , with manners curt ,</l>
       <l n="20">Takes Time by the forelock , and that does hurt .</l>
       <l n="21">On the Boston maiden I make no claim ,</l>
       <l n="22">To improve Time seems to be her aim .</l>
       <l n="23">And I heard an old spinster contriving a plan</l>
       <l n="24">Say , ‘ I ’ ll try to get Time as soon as I can .’</l>
       <l n="25">So none of these whom I ’ ve mentioned yet</l>
       <l n="26">A Valentine from Time shall get .</l>
       <l n="27">But I ’ ve in mind a maiden who ,</l>
       <l n="28">When a fond lover came to woo ,</l>
       <l n="29">Just blushed and hung down her pretty head ,</l>
       <l n="30">And ‘ Give me Time !’ was all she said .</l>
       <l n="31">By Cupid , that ’ s the maid for me !</l>

      <head>THE LAY OF LOTHARIO LEE</head>
       <l n="1">Lothario Lee was saddened , the world seemed grim and gray ;</l>
       <l n="2">For Lothario Lee was a lover bold , and today was St. Valentine ’ s Day .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>’ Twas St. Valentine ’ s Day , and he fain would send his heart to the fair Florelle , For the radiant maid had inspired in his breast a passion he could not quell .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">But alas ! for the gay Lothario , his heart was held in fee</l>
       <l n="2">Down at Dan Cupid ’ s pawnshop , at the sign of the roses three .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Willingly would the lovelorn knight that errant heart reclaim ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">So he sadly sat and pondered , as doleful as he could be ;</l>
       <l n="6">When a brilliant notion struck him —“ Done !” cried Lothario Lee .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">“ I ’ ll send her the pawnshop ticket , my tale of wo ’ twill tell ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">He sent her the tell-tale ticket , he scribbled a hasty line ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="11">And as she read the message , in the soul of the fair Florelle</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="13">With her heart in a frantic flutter , adown the street sped she ,</l>

       <l n="15">Cupid sat at a work-bench , mending a broken dart ;</l>

     <p>“ The best in my collection has been mended once or twice , But here ’ s a heart that may suit you , if you ’ re willing to pay the price .</p>

     <head>HISTORY</head>
     <p>The early history of Arcady is lost in the mists of ancient tradition . Looking backward through the reversed Opera Glass of Time , we see that it was originally settled by Adam and Eve . Since then it has been peopled by lovers of every age , sex , and condition of servitude .</p>
     <p>These people are usually gentle and mild-mannered , though occasionally given to angry or quarrelsome outbreaks caused by jealousy or misunderstanding . These outbreaks , however , are indulged in mostly for the pleasure of kissing and making up afterward , and forgiveness is one of their chief characteristics .</p>
     <p>The Arcadians are not gregarious , but go about in couples , or sit solitary and alone , wrapt in rapt thought .</p>
     <p>The male population is divided into Lovers , Poets , and Lunatics . There are various types of Lovers — those that sigh like a furnace , those that are pale and wan , and Swains .</p>
     <p>Swains are usually Rustic or Lovelorn .</p>
     <p>Feminine Arcadians are called Queens , Goddesses , Angels , and other titles of incredible foolishness .</p>
     <p>In physical appearance dwellers in Arcady are beautiful beyond all words . The women have eyes as stars of twilight fair , faces with gardens in , lily hands , amber-dropping hair , and feet like little mice .</p>
     <p>The men are handsome as Apollos ; of heroic size and Chesterfieldian manners .</p>
     <p>The above-mentioned qualities , though not always apparent to the disinterested observer , are realized and insisted upon by the Lovers themselves .</p>
     <p>Oftenest the Citizens of Arcady are transients and come and go as circumstances decree , but in some rare instances a happy pair spend their whole life in Arcady , or wander through the Happy Valley and make their home in the Land of Heart ’ s Desire .</p>

      <head>ARCADIA</head>
      <head>The province of Arcadia proper , the country between the Sea of Dreams and the Land of Heart ’ s Desire ( see map No . 2 ) , is a large district with well-defined boundaries .</head>
       <l n="1">The natural scenery is delightful , being chiefly made up of flowery</l>
       <l n="2">meads and sylvan dells threaded by murmuring or babbling brooks .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The River Lethe flows through the country , at one point dashing over a precipice in a great Cataract . This is known as Lover ’ s Leap and is , at times , the scene of fearful tragedies .</p>
     <p>Despairing Swains threaten to end their lives by dashing into the seething waters , unless their capricious sweethearts will smile on them .</p>
     <p>As the sweethearts usually smile , death rarely , if ever , ensues .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Near the middle of the Country of Arcadia is its capital , the town of</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">

       <l n="6">The inhabitants are the mild-eyed , melancholy Lotus-Eaters , whose cult</l>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The mossy banks of Lotus Land slope down to the River Lethe , and propt on beds of amaranth and moly the Lotus-Eaters delight to watch the long bright river drawing slowly and hear the dewy echoes calling and watch the emerald color ’ d water falling , and things like that .</p>
     <p>Across the river from Lotus Land lies the Garden of the Hesperides . These enterprising maidens do a brisk trade in Golden Apples , but this district must not be confounded with the Garden of Eden , as they are not the same .</p>
     <p>Going southward , following the shores of the Gulf of Time , we come to the Land of Yesterday — and further South to Never Never Land . These are beautiful and attractive spots much sought by Lovers of retrospective and imaginative tendencies .</p>
     <p>On the West side of the river , just South of Lotus Land , lies Wanderland , and nearby are the Elysian Fields . These districts are usually thronged with Lovers sauntering about in pairs , each couple being entirely oblivious of all the others .</p>
     <p>Further South we come to Dangerous Ground , which slopes down to Lover ’ s Leap . Near here is Fool ’ s Paradise . This is a popular spot and often most delicious adventures may be met here . The dwellers in Fool ’ s Paradise are absurdly happy , and sometimes climb a small eminence in the center of the place , known as the Height of Folly .</p>
     <p>To the West is a range of Blue Mountains . The despairing swain often climbs these , but when he reaches Mount Hope the world looks brighter and he soon gets back to the Happy Valley .</p>

      <head>ARCADY</head>
      <head>Arcady , the capital and chief city of the province of Arcadia , is a thickly settled town , with delightful outlying districts and suburban surroundings .</head>
      <head>PRELIMINARY RAMBLE : The stranger visiting Arcady for the first time cannot do better than to begin by a walk down Lovers ’ Lane , where he must surely be impressed by the shady trees and luxuriantly blooming flowers . Although sometimes flooded with morning sunshine , it is usually evening in Arcady . The moon shines always , sometimes a Honeymoon glows brightly , and there are generally stars , or perhaps a tender twilight with a fading sunset . On each side of the lane are the small houses of the Love-in-a-Cottage Colony . These cottages are rose-embowered and have white dimity curtains tied with blue ribbons . Crossing Lovers ’ Lane at right angles is Primrose Path , the fashionable street of Arcady . The dwellings here are air castles ( mostly of Spanish architecture ) and dreams of marble halls . One of the most celebrated mansions is Claude Melnotte ’ s :</head>
       <l n="1">A palace lifting to eternal summer</l>
       <l n="2">Its marble walls , from out a glossy bower</l>
       <l n="3">Of coolest foliage musical with birds ,</l>
       <l n="4">. . . while the perfumed light</l>
       <l n="5">Stole through the mists of alabaster lamps ,</l>
       <l n="6">And every air was heavy with the sighs</l>
       <l n="7">Of orange groves and music from sweet lutes ,</l>
       <l n="8">And murmurs of low fountains that gush forth</l>
       <l n="9">I ’ the midst of roses !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Farther on a shaft of moonlight falls on Juliet ’ s balcony , and beyond rise the towers and turrets of the Castle of La Joyeuse Garde . Primrose Path leads to Fool ’ s Paradise , but turning off to the West the traveler may stroll through Paradise Alley to the Elysian Fields . This beautiful spot is always fanned by south winds , and among its flowery arbors may be heard the songs of larks , nightingales , and turtle doves . Beyond lies the Forest of Arden . Here sturdy oaks covered with clinging vines abound ; but the tree most frequently seen is the Trysting Tree . These trees are interesting to visitors because of the symbols carved on their bark . Here one may notice the entwined initials of Aucassin and Nicolette ; there the true lover ’ s knot of Orpheus and Eurydice , or the overlapping hearts of Abelard and Heloise . Crossing a stile we wander by the brookside , or pause for a while at the old Ruined Mill to count the Shooting Stars .</p>

     <head>FLORA</head>
     <p>The flowers in Arcady are perennial and bloom all the year round . There are roses for every stage of the game , from the blush rose to the Bride Rose . There are moss roses for those who love old-fashioned flowers , and the Last Rose of Summer is a variety much admired by Romanticists . There are many old-fashioned gardens in Arcady , and here may be seen Bleeding Hearts , Forget-me-nots , Love-Lies-Bleeding , Pansies for Thoughts , and Rosemary for Remembrance . There is also Heartsease and Rue . There are lanes of lilacs and orchards of apple bloom . There are daisy fields and groves of orange trees in blossom . Wild flowers grow everywhere and mistletoe is indigenous . In the flower-shops may be bought orchids or violets in wealthy effects . In the Souvenir Shops one may find pressed or dried flowers , and these are much in demand . Poppies grow wild along the banks of the Lethe River , and the moon-flower flourishes in many gardens .</p>

      <head>HOTELS</head>
       <l n="1">The hotels in Arcady are excellent , with large and well-kept gardens ,</l>
       <l n="2">rose-embowered lawns , ivy-hung turrets , and all requirements of Romance .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In the interior of the town is Halcyon Hall , owned by the Lovemore Company . This is a new and sumptuous hotel , fitted up with a careful attention to detail , which combines eighteenth-century romance with nineteenth-century convenience . Among its advantages over the older hostelries are :</p>
     <p>An Express Elevator to the Seventh Heaven , and a Dream Interpreter Call and United States Valentine Chute on every floor . It is also lighted by an Automatic Electric Moon .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Other important hotels are Orchid Court , Honeymoon Hall , and Violet</l>
       <l n="2">Villa .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The Grand Union is an old and well-known hotel for married lovers . Less pretentious hostelries are the bijou Villa Beaubelle , Starlight Cottage , and Cupid ’ s Court .</p>
     <p>There are many Inns , both quaint and interesting . Their swinging sign-boards announce such appropriate appellations as “ Arms and the Man ,” “ The Moon and I ,” or “ The World is Mine .”</p>
     <p>The St. Valentine Apartment House , situated on Good Times Square , is a residential building of the first class .</p>
     <p>RESTAURANTS : These institutions are not specially popular in Arcady , as the inhabitants rarely have large appetites . Indeed , waiters often set artificial viands before their patrons , and the difference is not observed .</p>
     <p>Guests are always overcharged , as the true Lover has no thought of what he is paying and settles any bill without a murmur .</p>
     <p>A very popular table d ’ hôte service consists of Bread and Cheese and Kisses , and the partakers thereof drink to each other only with their eyes and leave a kiss in the cup , so that wine is never asked for .</p>
     <p>SWEET SHOPS : These shops are well patronized and their wares include nectar , honey , angel-cakes , taffy , kisses , and sweets of all sorts . Orders are filled also for wedding-cakes , and very soft drinks are served in loving-cups .</p>

     <p>Arcady is oftenest traversed on foot , as Lovers would rather stroll together through the beautiful country than to ride , and many of them walk on air . But , if desired , any vehicle for two may be obtained at the Livery Stables . Old-fashioned sidebar buggies and hansom cabs are much in demand , and some swains still enjoy a bicycle built for two .</p>
     <p>On the water all sorts of boats are used . On moonlight nights and balmy afternoons , and also in the radiant glow of the early morning , the lakes and streams are dotted with Shallops , Cockle-Shells , or Gondolas , in which loving pairs are idly drifting .</p>
     <p>Also , at the Livery Stables , palfreys may be engaged for eloping purposes , or chargers may be hired by the Lover of medieval tastes , and rope ladders are sold or rented for these occasions .</p>

      <head>INSTITUTIONS AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS</head>
      <head>PLACES OF INTEREST : A walk or drive round Arcady will reveal many points of interest to the traveler . The groves and dells are decorated with beautiful statues , among which may be noticed Venus , Eros , Psyche , Adonis , Lothario , Dulcinea , Byron , Mrs. Browning , and lovers of all times and ages .</head>
       <l n="1">Around the corner there is a little church with a chime of wedding</l>

     <p>POST-OFFICE : The post-office is in the heart of an old hollow oak tree at the corner of Lovers ’ Lane and Great Joy Street . It is always much used , but on St. Valentine ’ s Day the accommodations are quite inadequate .</p>
     <p>HEART EXCHANGE : The Heart Exchange is a time-honored institution , and a circulating library of hearts is patronized by summer girls and college youths . The Poet ’ s Corner ( corner of Grub Street and Maiden Lane ) is always a crowded spot , and the Photograph Galleries are well patronized .</p>

     <p>BANKS : There are many banks . One of the best known is the bank on which the wild thyme grows , and another almost equally noted is the bank on which the moonlight slept so sweetly in Jessica ’ s time .</p>
     <p>There is a Rainy-Day Bank , much patronized by thrifty young Lovers .</p>
     <p>Every day is Bank Holiday in Arcady .</p>
     <p>THE HOSPITAL : The hospital is a fine up-to-date building , for the benefit of lovesick swains . It is situated on the corner of Heartbreak Avenue and Despair Street , and is in charge of skilled medical men and well-trained nurses .</p>
     <p>Special wards are provided for the moonstruck , and padded cells for Swains suffering from Love ’ s delirium , or those frantic Lovers who have been bitten by the Green-Eyed Monster .</p>
     <p>Emergency Specialists provide first aid to the smitten , and Anatomical Experts attend those who have had their heads turned , or who have fallen over head and ears in love ; while clever Oculists look after those whom Love has made blind , or whose eyes are in a fine frenzy rolling .</p>
     <p>THE WEATHER BUREAU : The weather bureau in Arcady is a most unreliable affair .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">If a frown cloud his lady ’ s face , the sign to the Lover is : “ Fair and</l>

     <p>THE CAMPO SANTO : The Campo Santo is a most romantic and enjoyable spot . From earliest times it has been the habit of Lovers to wander through a graveyard — and the cemetery in Arcady so abounds in romantic memories that it is an Elysium in itself . The graves are kept green of such historic lovers as Paris and Helen , Paolo and Francesca , Hero and Leander ; while the monument of Romeo and Juliet is a veritable shrine and is always decked with fresh flowers .</p>
     <p>THE HALL OF FAME : Arcady never tires of honoring the memory of her eminent citizens .</p>
     <p>Aside from the tombstones in the Campo Santo and the statues in the Public Gardens , there are Monuments in the Hall of Fame that again perpetuate the memory of departed Heroes and Heroines of Romance .</p>
     <p>A tablet in bas-relief shows the despairing Huguenot Lovers , while next it stands a sculptured group of “ Darby and Joan .”</p>
     <p>The lovely Pastoral Work , “ Corydon and Phyllis ,” is opposite the equally charming piece , “ Strephon and Chloe .”</p>
     <p>Fair Margaret and Sweet William sleep in effigy , and noted Lovers of all climes and ages are represented .</p>

     <p>There is a Captive Aeroplane in the Seventh Heaven , which makes flights every half-hour . The stay in the Seventh Heaven is necessarily short , but enthusiastic Lovers go often .</p>
     <p>The Descent Into the Inferno is another diversion , patronized by intense or quick-tempered pairs .</p>

     </figure>
     <p>The Well of Truth is an interesting feature .</p>
     <p>Looking down into its crystal-clear depths , Lovers learn the truth about each other . This often causes much merriment , or the reverse . ( On the whole it is a dangerous pastime . )</p>
     <p>Joy Rides are usually clandestine and secret . They often end disastrously , but this is part of the fun . Any vehicle may be used and any speed maintained . Oftenest it is a slow , merely moving crawl , but again it may be a break-neck dash . Joy Rides have been popular in Arcady for many centuries . Some have been immortalized in Song and Story . Robert Browning ’ s “ Last Ride Together ” is a stirring tale of a Joy Ride . See also “ The Ride of Lochinvar ” and “ The Young Lady of Niger .”</p>
     <p>Bands of Serenaders are often heard in the Mayday Plaisance . These are of troubadour effect and sing sad or tender love songs to the accompaniment of such instruments as lutes , guitars , bassoons , etc . The audience ( in pairs ) are ensconced in vine-hung balconies and thus enjoy the appropriate music .</p>
     <p>Dreamland is a part of the Mayday Plaisance , and here young lovers may indulge in fairest Day-dreams .</p>

      <head>LANGUAGE</head>
      <head>For those who wish to derive the greatest possible pleasure from a visit to Arcady , some acquaintance with the Language of Love is indispensable . This can best be acquired by a careful study of poetry and romantic novels , and about four hours ’ practise every day . (“ The Lover ’ s Phrase Book ” is a useful little treatise , as it gives four thousand terms of endearment , alphabetically arranged , and is small enough to be carried in the pocket , for ready reference , in case of love at first sight . )</head>

      <head>There is a tradition of Arcadian simplicity in dress , but it is not always observed . The men , unless Poets , are often most careful dressers , and the women deck themselves in whatever garb they deem most attractive to men .</head>
       <l n="1">White muslin with blue ribbons is a popular costume , and “ some sort of</l>
       <l n="2">white , shimmering stuff ” is much used for gowns .</l>

     <p>Some women are clever enough to please the men by wearing all black or all white , and the hats are invariably large black ones or broad-leafed , rose-decked straws .</p>
     <p>Sunshades , fans , floating scarfs , and many coy adjuncts or fripperies of dress are seen , and flowers are much worn or carried .</p>

     <p>A more Sentimental Journey is along the Primrose Way , up Primrose Hill , and on , beyond the Night , across the Day , thus following the Course of True Love . Though this never runs smooth , it is often attempted by young Lovers , who sometimes persevere along the way and sometimes get sidetracked .</p>
     <p>To Friends ’ Shipyard is a pleasant stroll for an idle summer day . Here may be seen the Sailor laddies making knots . True lover ’ s knots may be bought here and carried away as souvenirs .</p>
     <p>Another attractive walk is along Wall Street . A delightful wall , full of nooks and crannies and overhung with blossoming vines , runs all along this street . At the corner of Moonshine Avenue is a beautiful monument representing Pyramus and Thisbe .</p>
     <p>A pleasant short ramble is along Amourette Avenue , past the Cosy Corners , to a Bower of Roses by Bendemeer ’ s Stream . The stream may be crossed by the Rustic Bridges or by the Stepping Stones , both being equally romantic .</p>

      <head>IT HAPPENED IN ARCADY</head>
      <head>THE GREAT HEART TRUST</head>
      <head>“ What is the matter , Kiddums ?” said Dame Venus , as Cupid entered her boudoir , with his blue ribbon untied and limply dragging behind him , and his eyes shining through big tears , like bluebirds taking a bath .</head>
       <l n="1">“ Mother , I ’ m a ruined man ,” and Cupid flung himself into his own little</l>
       <l n="2">chair , with a Delsarte gesture expressive of deepest dejection .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ What now , what now , my child ?” gently inquired his beautiful parent , holding her hand-mirror a little to one side , that she might better perceive her troubled offspring .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Why , just this . Some of those fools of finance have organized a Great</l>
       <l n="2">Heart Trust .”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Oh , Cupid , not really ! Then your occupation is indeed gone ! They have</l>
       <l n="4">taken the very hearts out of your mouth !”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Yes , Mother ; and aside from the loss of my business , just think how horrid it is to commercialize it so ! Why , I went to their office to make sure the report was true , and there they were , those horrible magnets ,— or whatever they call them ,— huddled round a ticker , and yelling out to one another such things as these : ‘ Loyal Hearts preferred . Chicago making bold advance ; sharp dealings noticed . Colorado Springs Hearts failed to rally ; feeling weak and generally depressed ; later , showed a slight reaction . Spinsters , no demand .’ I don ’ t know what it all means , I ’ m sure ; but I see my finish , and I may as well break my arrows and unstring my bow .”</p>
     <p>With a Delsarte gesture of vindictiveness and despair , Cupid doubled up his rosy , dimpled knee and snapped an arrow across it , throwing the pieces on the floor . Then he began to unstring his beautiful , curved bow .</p>
     <p>Venus looked sympathetically at her only son .</p>
     <p>“ Perhaps ,” she began , “ it isn ’ t as bad as you think , dear . Perhaps ,—”</p>
     <p>“ Now , isn ’ t that just like a woman !” exclaimed Cupid ; his round pink cheeks growing rounder and pinker as he stormed on . “ I just guess , Mother , if you had been down to the Heart Exchange and had heard and seen what I did , you wouldn ’ t say , ‘ Perhaps and perhaps .’ Why , I strolled over to listen to two of the magnets talking . One man said there was a corner in the matrimonial market and the other said he was too visionary , for that market wasn ’ t at all affected by the Heart Trust . He said it was only a question of a deal in futures . I don ’ t know what they mean by such talk as that .”</p>
     <p>“ I ’ m sure I don ’ t either , Cupid ,” said Venus , laying down her mirror ; for she had begun to realize that the question was serious and she must give it her undivided attention , which is a difficult matter for a real Venus . “ Tell me more , Son .”</p>
     <p>“ Well , I looked over a man ’ s shoulder , and he was reading from another of those ticker things . He was a horrid man , not the kind I like to deal with , at all . He read things like this : ‘ Summer Girls . Sensational Advances . No Reserve . Public Wary . Actresses not well supported , but best of financial backing ; good figures .’”</p>
     <p>“ But , Cupid , dearie , you ’ re not interested in hearts like those , I hope .”</p>
     <p>“ Now , Mother , you know perfectly well that a man in my business position is obliged to deal in all sorts of hearts . And I ’ ve always had a monopoly of the market . Now the Great Heart Trust has spoiled my trade entirely .” He broke another arrow across his knee and his quiver seemed to have transferred itself to his rosy lips .</p>
     <p>“ But , Son ,” began Venus , hopefully , “ doesn ’ t this affect city hearts only ? Can ’ t you go to the country , and in the flowery fields and lovers ’ lanes find all the business you can attend to ?”</p>
     <p>“ No , Mother ,” and the curly head drooped like a dandelion at midday . “ This Great Heart Trust is universal . I stole a look at one of their papers this morning , and one column was headed ‘ Rural Reports .’ Then it said : ‘ Country depressed , dull ; moving slowly . Domestic Products quiet and well-behaved ; in great demand . Southern peach crop very fine ; quickly snapped up .’ I can ’ t understand all their queer terms , but I suppose I shall have to learn them .”</p>
     <p>“ Yes , Cupid , do that . Meet them on their own ground and fight them with their own weapons . You know more about hearts than they do ; think of your long experience .”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , Mother ! Imagine me occupying a seat in the Heart Exchange ! Why , I ’ d have to wear a ticker ribbon instead of my blue sash . No , I never could learn their language . Why , they talk like this : ‘ Coquettes ’ hearts , Common stock ; a declining movement shows a hardening tendency , but the stock is unsteady , with exciting effects .’ And not only our own people are concerned , but they quote prices on Foreign Hearts , and , Mother , the rates are almost prohibitive . Then one report said , ‘ Fiancées ’ Hearts ; do not fear local pressure !’ Now what can such talk mean ? Then it said : ‘ Boston . ( See Ice Trust . )’ No , Mother , it ’ s no use ; I can ’ t understand their jargon .”</p>
     <p>“ But , Cupid , you can learn . The age is progressive and you must keep up with it . You know yourself that for some time your methods of dealing in hearts have been considered old-fashioned . Now you must try more up-to-date ways .”</p>
     <p>“ But , Mother , some reports are so sad . Their paper said today that there were many heart failures reported . Why , one heart broke at sixty — during a period of depression ! And then they quoted ‘ Hearts Bowed Down .’ That seemed to be a falling market , with heavy sales . Several hearts were lost or stolen , and altogether it made me feel panic-stricken . And what do you think , they quoted ‘ Husbands ’ as inclined to firmness , but showing bearish indications ! No , it ’ s all out of my line . I know my business , I ’ ve practised it many , many years , and I ’ m too old to learn new tricks .”</p>
     <p>Venus looked at her son in much the same way that any mother looks at her child when she knows she can help him out of his difficulty .</p>
     <p>“ You dear , silly child ,” she said , “ you ’ re needlessly alarmed . Every trust must have its day , but they all fail sooner or later . Bide your time , and after a while you ’ ll find that the trust is all over , and you can carry on the game in your own sweet way . I have heard of some kind of a queer machine ,— I think it ’ s called a ‘ trust buster ,’— invented just on purpose to break up these trusts . I ’ ll get you one . Now kiss me and run away and play .”</p>
     <p>Venus picked up her mirror again and sat gazing at her beautiful nose in rapt admiration of that classic member .</p>
     <p>Cupid cheered up considerably . “ Mother , you ’ re a blessing ,” he said , as he kissed the tip of her ear . “ But ,” he added , as he ran away to chase butterflies , “ after this trust-buster thing has done its smashing , won ’ t I have a time mending all the broken hearts !”</p>

      <head>DIRE DESTRUCTION AND DEPLORABLE DISASTER</head>
      <head>DESOLATION AND DEVASTATION CAUSED BY AN APPALLING AIRQUAKE</head>
      <head>THOUSANDS OF CASTLES IN THE AIR OVERTHROWN AND DEMOLISHED</head>
       <l n="1">( From our own correspondent )</l>
     </lg>
     <p>ARCADY : A terrible airquake has wrought havoc in the densely populated atmosphere above this locality . Without a word of warning , noble and beautiful castles in the air went toppling to their ruin .</p>
     <p>Though difficult to get details in these first hours of confusion and distress , it is known that the sumptuous air castle built by Claude Melnotte for the Lady of Lyons is entirely demolished . The devastated area is widespread , and from the most magnificent dream of marble halls to the humblest vision of love in a cottage , all of the Chateaux en Espagne have fallen . It is feared that many loves have been lost in the ruins . Even now the agents of the Love Insurance Company are on the spot estimating the casualties . Many of the survivors declare they will rebuild at the earliest possible moment . Indeed , it may safely be predicted that new and more elaborate and beautiful castles in the air will soon take the place of the old ones . Among the débris of ruined hopes and shattered ideals , pathetic sights may be seen . Here a broken resolution sticks up through the mass of fragments , there a broken promise ; and everywhere are fallen idols and upset plans . The explorer is menaced by pits of boiling imagination and fine frenzies rolling . But relief supplies are already being received . A ship , with Youth at the helm and Pleasure at the prow , has just come into the harbor , bringing a cargo of fresh hopes and such stuff as dreams are made of .</p>
     <p>Owing to the prevalence of mirage it is difficult to give definite statistics ; but the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is still visible , and the sanguine , light-hearted people have already begun to rear anew their castles in the air .</p>
