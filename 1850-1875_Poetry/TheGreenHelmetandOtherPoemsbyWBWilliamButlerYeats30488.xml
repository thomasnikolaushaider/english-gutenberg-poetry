    <head>HIS DREAM</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I swayed upon the gaudy stern</l>
     <l n="2">The butt end of a steering oar ,</l>
     <l n="3">And everywhere that I could turn</l>
     <l n="4">Men ran upon the shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And though I would have hushed the crowd</l>
     <l n="6">There was no mother 's son but said ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ What is the figure in a shroud</l>
     <l n="8">Upon a gaudy bed ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And fishes bubbling to the brim</l>
     <l n="10">Cried out upon that thing beneath ,</l>
     <l n="11">It had such dignity of limb ,</l>
     <l n="12">By the sweet name of Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Though I 'd my finger on my lip ,</l>
     <l n="14">What could I but take up the song ?</l>
     <l n="15">And fish and crowd and gaudy ship</l>
     <l n="16">Cried out the whole night long ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Crying amid the glittering sea ,</l>
     <l n="18">Naming it with ecstatic breath ,</l>
     <l n="19">Because it had such dignity</l>
     <l n="20">By the sweet name of Death .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>A WOMAN HOMER SUNG</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">If any man drew near</l>
     <l n="2">When I was young ,</l>
     <l n="3">I thought , “ He holds her dear , ”</l>
     <l n="4">And shook with hate and fear .</l>
     <l n="5">But oh , ‘ twas bitter wrong</l>
     <l n="6">If he could pass her by</l>
     <l n="7">With an indifferent eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Whereon I wrote and wrought ,</l>
     <l n="9">And now , being gray ,</l>
     <l n="10">I dream that I have brought</l>
     <l n="11">To such a pitch my thought</l>
     <l n="12">That coming time can say ,</l>
     <l n="13">“ He shadowed in a glass</l>
     <l n="14">What thing her body was . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">For she had fiery blood</l>
     <l n="16">When I was young ,</l>
     <l n="17">And trod so sweetly proud</l>
     <l n="18">As ‘ twere upon a cloud ,</l>
     <l n="19">A woman Homer sung ,</l>
     <l n="20">That life and letters seem</l>
     <l n="21">But an heroic dream .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THAT THE NIGHT COME</head>
     <l n="1">She lived in storm and strife .</l>
     <l n="2">Her soul had such desire</l>
     <l n="3">For what proud death may bring</l>
     <l n="4">That it could not endure</l>
     <l n="5">The common good of life ,</l>
     <l n="6">But lived as ‘ twere a king</l>
     <l n="7">That packed his marriage day</l>
     <l n="8">With banneret and pennon ,</l>
     <l n="9">Trumpet and kettledrum ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the outrageous cannon ,</l>
     <l n="11">To bundle Time away</l>
     <l n="12">That the night come .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE CONSOLATION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I had this thought awhile ago ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ My darling cannot understand</l>
     <l n="3">What I have done , or what would do</l>
     <l n="4">In this blind bitter land . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And I grew weary of the sun</l>
     <l n="6">Until my thoughts cleared up again ,</l>
     <l n="7">Remembering that the best I have done</l>
     <l n="8">Was done to make it plain ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">That every year I have cried , “ At length</l>
     <l n="10">My darling understands it all ,</l>
     <l n="11">Because I have come into my strength ,</l>
     <l n="12">And words obey my call . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">That had she done so who can say</l>
     <l n="14">What would have shaken from the sieve ?</l>
     <l n="15">I might have thrown poor words away</l>
     <l n="16">And been content to live .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FRIENDS</head>
     <l n="1">Now must I these three praise —</l>
     <l n="2">Three women that have wrought</l>
     <l n="3">What joy is in my days ;</l>
     <l n="4">One that no passing thought ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nor those unpassing cares ,</l>
     <l n="6">No , not in these fifteen</l>
     <l n="7">Many times troubled years ,</l>
     <l n="8">Could ever come between</l>
     <l n="9">Heart and delighted heart ;</l>
     <l n="10">And one because her hand</l>
     <l n="11">Had strength that could unbind</l>
     <l n="12">What none can understand ,</l>
     <l n="13">What none can have and thrive ,</l>
     <l n="14">Youth 's dreamy load , till she</l>
     <l n="15">So changed me that I live</l>
     <l n="16">Labouring in ecstasy .</l>
     <l n="17">And what of her that took</l>
     <l n="18">All till my youth was gone</l>
     <l n="19">With scarce a pitying look ?</l>
     <l n="20">How should I praise that one ?</l>
     <l n="21">When day begins to break</l>
     <l n="22">I count my good and bad ,</l>
     <l n="23">Being wakeful for her sake ,</l>
     <l n="24">Remembering what she had ,</l>
     <l n="25">What eagle look still shows ,</l>
     <l n="26">While up from my heart 's root</l>
     <l n="27">So great a sweetness flows</l>
     <l n="28">I shake from head to foot .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>NO SECOND TROY</head>
     <l n="1">Why should I blame her that she filled my days</l>
     <l n="2">With misery , or that she would of late</l>
     <l n="3">Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or hurled the little streets upon the great ,</l>
     <l n="5">Had they but courage equal to desire ?</l>
     <l n="6">What could have made her peaceful with a mind</l>
     <l n="7">That nobleness made simple as a fire ,</l>
     <l n="8">With beauty like a tightened bow , a kind</l>
     <l n="9">That is not natural in an age like this ,</l>
     <l n="10">Being high and solitary and most stern ?</l>
     <l n="11">Why , what could she have done being what she is ?</l>
     <l n="12">Was there another Troy for her to burn ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>RECONCILIATION</head>
     <l n="1">Some may have blamed you that you took away</l>
     <l n="2">The verses that could move them on the day</l>
     <l n="3">When , the ears being deafened , the sight of the eyes blind</l>
     <l n="4">With lightning you went from me , and I could find</l>
     <l n="5">Nothing to make a song about but kings ,</l>
     <l n="6">Helmets , and swords , and half-forgotten things</l>
     <l n="7">That were like memories of you — but now</l>
     <l n="8">We 'll out , for the world lives as long ago ;</l>
     <l n="9">And while we 're in our laughing , weeping fit ,</l>
     <l n="10">Hurl helmets , crowns , and swords into the pit .</l>
     <l n="11">But , dear , cling close to me ; since you were gone ,</l>
     <l n="12">My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>KING AND NO KING</head>
     <l n="1">“ Would it were anything but merely voice ! ”</l>
     <l n="2">The No King cried who after that was King ,</l>
     <l n="3">Because he had not heard of anything</l>
     <l n="4">That balanced with a word is more than noise ;</l>
     <l n="5">Yet Old Romance being kind , let him prevail</l>
     <l n="6">Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot ,</l>
     <l n="7">Though he 'd but cannon — Whereas we that had thought</l>
     <l n="8">To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale</l>
     <l n="9">Have been defeated by that pledge you gave</l>
     <l n="10">In momentary anger long ago ;</l>
     <l n="11">And I that have not your faith , how shall I know</l>
     <l n="12">That in the blinding light beyond the grave</l>
     <l n="13">We 'll find so good a thing as that we have lost ?</l>
     <l n="14">The hourly kindness , the day 's common speech ,</l>
     <l n="15">The habitual content of each with each</l>
     <l n="16">When neither soul nor body has been crossed .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE COLD HEAVEN</head>
     <l n="1">Suddenly I saw the cold and rook delighting Heaven</l>
     <l n="2">That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice ,</l>
     <l n="3">And thereupon imagination and heart were driven</l>
     <l n="4">So wild , that every casual thought of that and this</l>
     <l n="5">Vanished , and left but memories , that should be out of season</l>
     <l n="6">With the hot blood of youth , of love crossed long ago ;</l>
     <l n="7">And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason ,</l>
     <l n="8">Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="9">Riddled with light . Ah ! when the ghost begins to quicken ,</l>
     <l n="10">Confusion of the death-bed over , is it sent</l>
     <l n="11">Out naked on the roads , as the books say , and stricken</l>
     <l n="12">By the injustice of the skies for punishment ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PEACE</head>
     <l n="1">Ah , that Time could touch a form</l>
     <l n="2">That could show what Homer 's age</l>
     <l n="3">Bred to be a hero 's wage .</l>
     <l n="4">“ Were not all her life but storm ,</l>
     <l n="5">Would not painters paint a form</l>
     <l n="6">Of such noble lines ” I said .</l>
     <l n="7">“ Such a delicate high head ,</l>
     <l n="8">So much sternness and such charm ,</l>
     <l n="9">Till they had changed us to like strength ? ”</l>
     <l n="10">Ah , but peace that comes at length ,</l>
     <l n="11">Came when Time had touched her form .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AGAINST UNWORTHY PRAISE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O heart , be at peace , because</l>
     <l n="2">Nor knave nor dolt can break</l>
     <l n="3">What 's not for their applause ,</l>
     <l n="4">Being for a woman 's sake .</l>
     <l n="5">Enough if the work has seemed ,</l>
     <l n="6">So did she your strength renew ,</l>
     <l n="7">A dream that a lion had dreamed</l>
     <l n="8">Till the wilderness cried aloud ,</l>
     <l n="9">A secret between you two ,</l>
     <l n="10">Between the proud and the proud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">What , still you would have their praise !</l>
     <l n="12">But here 's a haughtier text ,</l>
     <l n="13">The labyrinth of her days</l>
     <l n="14">That her own strangeness perplexed ;</l>
     <l n="15">And how what her dreaming gave</l>
     <l n="16">Earned slander , ingratitude ,</l>
     <l n="17">From self-same dolt and knave ;</l>
     <l n="18">Aye , and worse wrong than these .</l>
     <l n="19">Yet she , singing upon her road ,</l>
     <l n="20">Half lion , half child , is at peace .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE FASCINATION OF WHAT 'S DIFFICULT</head>
     <l n="1">The fascination of what 's difficult</l>
     <l n="2">Has dried the sap out of my veins , and rent</l>
     <l n="3">Spontaneous joy and natural content</l>
     <l n="4">Out of my heart . There 's something ails our colt</l>
     <l n="5">That must , as if it had not holy blood ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nor on an Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud ,</l>
     <l n="7">Shiver under the lash , strain , sweat and jolt</l>
     <l n="8">As though it dragged road metal . My curse on plays</l>
     <l n="9">That have to be set up in fifty ways ,</l>
     <l n="10">On the day 's war with every knave and dolt ,</l>
     <l n="11">Theatre business , management of men .</l>
     <l n="12">I swear before the dawn comes round again</l>
     <l n="13">I 'll find the stable and pull out the bolt .</l>

    <head>A DRINKING SONG</head>
     <l n="1">Wine comes in at the mouth</l>
     <l n="2">And love comes in at the eye ;</l>
     <l n="3">That 's all we shall know for truth</l>
     <l n="4">Before we grow old and die .</l>
     <l n="5">I lift the glass to my mouth ,</l>

     <l n="3">When we are high and airy hundreds say</l>
     <l n="4">That if we hold that flight they 'll leave the place ,</l>
     <l n="5">While those same hundreds mock another day</l>
     <l n="6">Because we have made our art of common things ,</l>

     <l n="10">And know them to the bone ; impart to us —</l>
     <l n="11">We 'll keep the secret — a new trick to please .</l>
     <l n="12">Is there a bridle for this Proteus</l>
     <l n="13">That turns and changes like his draughty seas ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">An Heroic Farce</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>SCENE : A house made of logs . There are two windows at the back and a door which cuts off one of the corners of the room . Through the door one can see low rocks which make the ground outside higher than it is within , and beyond the rocks a misty moon-lit sea . Through the windows one can see nothing but the sea . There is a great chair at the opposite side to the door , and in front of it a table with cups and a flagon of ale . Here and there are stools .</p>
   <p>At the Abbey Theatre the house is orange red and the chairs and tables and flagons black , with a slight purple tinge which is not clearly distinguishable from the black . The rocks are black with a few green touches . The sea is green and luminous , and all the characters except the RED MAN and the Black Men are dressed in various shades of green , one or two with touches of purple which look nearly black . The Black Men all wear dark purple and have eared caps , and at the end their eyes should look green from the reflected light of the sea . The RED MAN is altogether in red . He is very tall , and his height increased by horns on the Green Helmet . The effect is intentionally violent and startling .</p>
