    <docTitle><titlePart>DOMESDAY BOOK DOMESDAY BOOK Take any life you choose and study it : It gladdens , troubles , changes many lives . The life goes out , how many things result ? Fate drops a stone , and to the utmost shores The circles spread .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <epigraph>
     <p>Now , such a book were endless , If every circle , riffle should be traced Of any life — and so of Elenor Murray , Whose life was humble and whose death was tragic . And yet behold the riffles spread , the lives That are affected , and the secrets gained Of lives she never knew of , as for that . For even the world could not contain the books That should be written , if all deeds were traced , Effects , results , gains , losses , of her life , And of her death . Concretely said , in brief , A man and woman have produced this child ; What was the child 's pre-natal circumstance ? How did her birth affect the father , mother ? What did their friends , old women , relatives Take from the child in feeling , joy or pain ? What of her childhood friends , her days at school , Her teachers , girlhood sweethearts , lovers later , When she became a woman ? What of these ? And what of those who got effects because They knew this Elenor Murray ? Then she dies . Read how the human secrets are exposed In many lives because she died — not all Lives , by her death affected , written here . The reader may trace out such other riffles As come to him — this book must have an end .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>Enough is shown to show what could be told If we should write a world of books . In brief One feature of the plot elaborates The closeness of one life , however humble With every life upon this globe . In truth I sit here in<settlement>Chicago</settlement>, housed and fed , And think the world secure , at peace , the clock Just striking three , in Europe striking eight : And in some province , in some palace , hut , Some words are spoken , or a fisticuff Results between two brawlers , and for that A blue-eyed boy , my grandson , we may say , Not even yet in seed , but to be born A half a century hence , is by those words , That fisticuff , drawn into war in Europe , Shrieks from a bullet through the groin , and lies Under the sod of<country>France</country>.</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>But to return To Elenor Murray , I have made a book Called Domesday Book , a census spiritual Taken of our America , or in part Taken , not wholly taken , it may be . For William Merival , the coroner , Who probed the death of Elenor Murray goes As far as may be , and beyond his power , In diagnosis of America , While finding out the cause of death . In short Becomes a William the Conqueror that way In making up a Domesday Book for us .... Of this a little later . But before We touch upon the Domesday book of old , We take up Elenor Murray , show her birth ; Then skip all time between and show her death ; Then take up Coroner Merival — who was he ? Then trace the life of Elenor Murray through The witnesses at the inquest on the body Of Elenor Murray ;— also letters written , And essays written , conversations heard , But all evoked by Elenor Murray 's death . And by the way trace riffles here and there .... A word now on the Domesday book of old : Remember not a book of doom , but a book Of houses ; domus , house , so domus book . And this book of the death of Elenor Murray Is not a book of doom , though showing too How fate was woven round her , and the souls That touched her soul ; but is a house book too Of riches , poverty , and weakness , strength Of this our country . If you take St. Luke You find an angel came to Mary , said : Hail ! thou art highly favored , shalt conceive , Bring forth a son , a king for David 's throne :— So tracing life before the life was born . We do the same for Elenor Murray , though No man or angel said to Elenor 's mother : You have found favor , you are blessed of God , You shall conceive , bring forth a daughter blest , And blessing you . Quite otherwise the case , As being blest or blessing , something like Perhaps , in that desire , or flame of life , Which gifts new souls with passion , strength and love .... This is the manner of the girl 's conception , And of her birth :—...</p>

   <head>THE BIRTH OF ELENOR MURRAY</head>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">What are the mortal facts</l>
     <l n="3">With which we deal ? The man is thirty years ,</l>
     <l n="4">Most vital , in a richness physical ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of musical heart and feeling ; and the woman</l>
     <l n="6">Is twenty-eight , a cradle warm and rich</l>
     <l n="7">For life to grow in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">And the time is this :</l>
     <l n="9">This Henry Murray has a mood of peace ,</l>
     <l n="10">A splendor as of June , has for the time</l>
     <l n="11">Quelled anarchy within him , come to law ,</l>
     <l n="12">Sees life a thing of beauty , happiness ,</l>
     <l n="13">And fortune glow before him . And the mother ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sunning her feathers in his genial light ,</l>
     <l n="15">Takes longing and has hope . For body 's season</l>
     <l n="16">The blood of youth leaps in them like a fountain ,</l>
     <l n="17">And splashes musically in the crystal pool</l>
     <l n="18">Of quiet days and hours . They rise refreshed ,</l>
     <l n="19">Feel all the sun 's strength flow through muscles , nerves ;</l>
     <l n="20">Extract from food no poison , only health ;</l>
     <l n="21">Are sensitive to simple things , the turn</l>
     <l n="22">Of leaves on trees , flowers springing , robins ’ songs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">Now such a time must prosper love 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="24">Fed gently , tended wisely , left to mount</l>
     <l n="25">In flame and light . A prospering fate occurs</l>
     <l n="26">To send this Henry Murray from his wife ,</l>
     <l n="27">And keep him absent for a month — inspire</l>
     <l n="28">A daily letter , written of the joys ,</l>
     <l n="29">And hopes they have together , and omit ,</l>
     <l n="30">Forgotten for the time , old aches , despairs ,</l>
     <l n="31">Forebodings for the future .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="32">What results ?</l>
     <l n="33">For thirty days her youth , and youthful blood</l>
     <l n="34">Under the stimulus of absence , letters ,</l>
     <l n="35">And growing longing , laves and soothes and feeds ,</l>
     <l n="36">Like streams that nourish fields , her body 's being .</l>
     <l n="37">Enriches cells to plumpness , dim , asleep ,</l>
     <l n="38">Which stretch , expand and turn , the prototype</l>
     <l n="39">Of a baby newly born ; which after the cry</l>
     <l n="40">At midnight , taking breath an hour before ,—</l>
     <l n="41">That cry which is of things most tragical ,</l>
     <l n="42">The tragedy most poignant — sleeps and rests ,</l>
     <l n="43">And flicks its little fingers , with closed eyes</l>
     <l n="44">Senses with visions of unopened leaves</l>
     <l n="45">This monstrous and external sphere , the world ,</l>
     <l n="46">And what moves in it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="47">So she thinks of him ,</l>
     <l n="48">And longs for his return , and as she longs</l>
     <l n="49">The rivers of her body run and ripple ,</l>
     <l n="50">Refresh and quicken her . The morning 's light</l>
     <l n="51">Flutters upon the ceiling , and she lies</l>
     <l n="52">And stretches drowsily in the breaking slumber</l>
     <l n="53">Of fluctuant emotion , calls to him</l>
     <l n="54">With spirit and flesh , until his very name</l>
     <l n="55">Seems like to form in sound , while lips are closed ,</l>
     <l n="56">And tongue is motionless , beyond herself ,</l>
     <l n="57">And in the middle spaces of the room</l>
     <l n="58">Calls back to her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="59">And Henry Murray caught ,</l>
     <l n="60">In letters , which she sent him , all she felt ,</l>
     <l n="61">Re-kindled it and sped it back to her .</l>
     <l n="62">Then came a lover 's fancy in his brain :</l>
     <l n="63">He would return unlooked for — who , the god ,</l>
     <l n="64">Inspired the fancy ?— find her in what mood</l>
     <l n="65">She might be in his absence , where no blur</l>
     <l n="66">Of expectation of his coming changed</l>
     <l n="67">Her color , flame of spirit . And he bought</l>
     <l n="68">Some chablis and a cake , slipped noiselessly</l>
     <l n="69">Into the chamber where she lay asleep ,</l>
     <l n="70">And had a light upon her face before</l>
     <l n="71">She woke and saw him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="72">How she cried her joy !</l>
     <l n="73">And put her arms around him , burned away</l>
     <l n="74">In one great moment from a goblet of fire ,</l>
     <l n="75">Which over-flowed , whatever she had felt</l>
     <l n="76">Of shrinking or distaste , or loveless hands</l>
     <l n="77">At any time before , and burned it there</l>
     <l n="78">Till even the ashes sparkled , blew away</l>
     <l n="79">In incense and in light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="80">She rose and slipped</l>
     <l n="81">A robe on and her slippers ; drew a stand</l>
     <l n="82">Between them for the chablis and the cake .</l>
     <l n="83">And drank and ate with him , and showed her teeth ,</l>
     <l n="84">While laughing , shaking curls , and flinging back</l>
     <l n="85">Her head for rapture , and in little crows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="86">And thus the wine caught up the resting cells ,</l>
     <l n="87">And flung them in the current , and their blood</l>
     <l n="88">Flows silently and swiftly , running deep ;</l>
     <l n="89">And their two hearts beat like the rhythmic chimes</l>
     <l n="90">Of little bells of steel made blue by flame ,</l>
     <l n="91">Because their lives are ready now , and life</l>
     <l n="92">Cries out to life for life to be . The fire ,</l>
     <l n="93">Lit in the altar of their eyes , is blind</l>
     <l n="94">For mysteries that urge , the blood of them</l>
     <l n="95">In separate streams would mingle , hurried on</l>
     <l n="96">By energy from the heights of ancient mountains ;</l>
     <l n="97">The God himself , and Life , the Gift of God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="98">And as result the hurrying microcosms</l>
     <l n="99">Out of their beings sweep , seek out , embrace ,</l>
     <l n="100">Dance for the rapture of freedom , being loosed ;</l>
     <l n="101">Unite , achieve their destiny , find the cradle</l>
     <l n="102">Of sleep and growth , take up the cryptic task</l>
     <l n="103">Of maturation and of fashioning ;</l>
     <l n="104">Where no light is except the light of God</l>
     <l n="105">To light the human spirit , which emerges</l>
     <l n="106">From nothing that man knows ; and where a face ,</l>
     <l n="107">To be a woman 's or a man 's takes form :</l>
     <l n="108">Hands that shall gladden , lips that shall enthrall</l>
     <l n="109">With songs or kisses , hands and lips , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="110">To hurt and poison . All is with the fates ,</l>
     <l n="111">And all beyond us .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="112">Now the seed is sown ,</l>
     <l n="113">The flower must grow and blossom . Something comes ,</l>
     <l n="114">Perhaps , to whisper something in the ear</l>
     <l n="115">That will exert itself against the mass</l>
     <l n="116">That grows , proliferates ; but for the rest</l>
     <l n="117">The task is done . One thing remains alone :</l>
     <l n="118">It is a daughter , woman , that you bear ,</l>
     <l n="119">A whisper says to her — It is her wish —</l>
     <l n="120">Her wish materializes in a voice</l>
     <l n="121">Which says : the name of Elenor is sweet ,</l>
     <l n="122">Choose that for her — Elenor , which is light ,</l>
     <l n="123">The light of Helen , but a lesser light</l>
     <l n="124">In this our larger world ; a light to shine ,</l>
     <l n="125">And lure amid the tangled woodland ways</l>
     <l n="126">Of this our life ; a firefly beating wings</l>
     <l n="127">Here , there amid the thickets of hard days .</l>
     <l n="128">And to go out at last , as all lights do ,</l>
     <l n="129">And leave a memory , perhaps , but leave</l>
     <l n="130">No meaning to be known of any man ....</l>
     <l n="131">So Elenor Murray is conceived and born .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="132">But now this Elenor Murray being born ,</l>
     <l n="133">We start not with her life , but with her death ,</l>
     <l n="134">The finding of her body by the river .</l>
     <l n="135">And then as Coroner Merival takes proof</l>
     <l n="136">Her life comes forth , until the Coroner</l>
     <l n="137">Traces it to the moment of her death .</l>
     <l n="138">And thus both life and death of her are known .</l>
     <l n="139">This the beginning of the mystery :—</l>
    </lg>
    <p>FINDING OF THE BODY</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="140">Elenor Murray , daughter of Henry Murray ,</l>
     <l n="141">The druggist at LeRoy , a village near</l>
     <l n="142">The shadow of Starved Rock , this Elenor</l>
     <l n="143">But recently returned from France , a heart</l>
     <l n="144">Who gave her service in the world at war ,</l>
     <l n="145">Was found along the river 's shore , a mile</l>
     <l n="146">Above Starved Rock , on August 7th , the day</l>
     <l n="147">Year 1679 , LaSalle set sail</l>
     <l n="148">For Michilmackinac to reach Green Bay</l>
     <l n="149">In the Griffin , in the winter snow and sleet ,</l>
     <l n="150">Reaching “ Lone Cliff , ” Starved Rock its later name ,</l>
     <l n="151">Also La Vantum , village of the tribe</l>
     <l n="152">Called Illini .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="153">This may be taken to speak</l>
     <l n="154">The symbol of her life and fate . For first</l>
     <l n="155">This Elenor Murray comes into this life ,</l>
     <l n="156">And lives her youth where the Rock 's shadow falls ,</l>
     <l n="157">As if to say her life should starve and lie</l>
     <l n="158">Beneath a shadow , wandering in the world ,</l>
     <l n="159">As Cavalier LaSalle did , born at Rouen ,</l>
     <l n="160">Shot down on Trinity River , Texas . She</l>
     <l n="161">Searches for life and conquest of herself</l>
     <l n="162">With the same sleepless spirit of LaSalle ;</l>
     <l n="163">And comes back to the shadow of the Rock ,</l>
     <l n="164">And dies beneath its shadow . Cause of death ?</l>
     <l n="165">Was she like Sieur LaSalle shot down , or choked ,</l>
     <l n="166">Struck , poisoned ? Let the coroner decide .</l>
     <l n="167">Who , hearing of the matter , takes the body</l>
     <l n="168">And brings it to LeRoy , is taking proofs ;</l>
     <l n="169">Lets doctors cut the body , probe and peer</l>
     <l n="170">To find the cause of death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="171">And so this morning</l>
     <l n="172">Of August 7th , as a hunter walks —</l>
     <l n="173">Looking for rabbits maybe , aimless hunting —</l>
     <l n="174">Over the meadow where the Illini 's</l>
     <l n="175">La Vantum stood two hundred years before ,</l>
     <l n="176">Gun over arm in readiness for game ,</l>
     <l n="177">Sees some two hundred paces to the south</l>
     <l n="178">Bright colors , red and blue ; thinks off the bat</l>
     <l n="179">A human body lies there , hurries on</l>
     <l n="180">And finds the girl 's dead body , hatless head ,</l>
     <l n="181">The hat some paces off , as if she fell</l>
     <l n="182">In such way that the hat dashed off . Her arms</l>
     <l n="183">Lying outstretched , the body half on side ,</l>
     <l n="184">The face upturned to heaven , open eyes</l>
     <l n="185">That might have seen Starved Rock until the eyes</l>
     <l n="186">Sank down in darkness where no image comes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="187">This hunter knew the body , bent and looked ;</l>
     <l n="188">Gave forth a gasp of horror , leaned and touched</l>
     <l n="189">The cold hand of the dead : saw in her pocket ,</l>
     <l n="190">Sticking above the pocket 's edge a banner ,</l>
     <l n="191">And took it forth , saw it was Joan of Arc</l>
     <l n="192">In helmet and cuirass , kneeling in prayer .</l>
     <l n="193">And in the banner a paper with these words :</l>
     <l n="194">“ To be brave , and not to flinch . ” And standing there</l>
     <l n="195">This hunter knew that Elenor Murray came</l>
     <l n="196">Some days before from France , was visiting</l>
     <l n="197">An aunt , named Irma Leese beyond LeRoy .</l>
     <l n="198">What was she doing by the river 's shore ?</l>
     <l n="199">He saw no mark upon her , and no blood ;</l>
     <l n="200">No pistol by her , nothing disarranged</l>
     <l n="201">Of hair or clothing , showing struggle — nothing</l>
     <l n="202">To indicate the death she met . Who saw her</l>
     <l n="203">Before or when she died ? How long had death</l>
     <l n="204">Been on her eyes ? Some hours , or over-night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="205">The hunter touched her hand , already stiff ;</l>
     <l n="206">And saw the dew upon her hair and brow ,</l>
     <l n="207">And a blue deadness in her eyes , like pebbles .</l>
     <l n="208">The lips were black , and bottle flies had come</l>
     <l n="209">To feed upon her tongue . ‘ Tis ten o'clock ,</l>
     <l n="210">The coolness of the August night unchanged</l>
     <l n="211">By this spent sun of August . And the moon</l>
     <l n="212">Lies dead and wasted there beyond Starved Rock .</l>
     <l n="213">The moon was beautiful last night ! To walk</l>
     <l n="214">Beside the river under the August moon</l>
     <l n="215">Took Elenor Murray 's fancy , as he thinks .</l>
     <l n="216">Then thinking of the aunt of Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="217">Who should be notified , the hunter runs</l>
     <l n="218">To tell the aunt — but there 's the coroner —</l>
     <l n="219">Is there not law the coroner should know ?</l>
     <l n="220">Should not the body lie , as it was found ,</l>
     <l n="221">Until the coroner takes charge of it ?</l>
     <l n="222">Should not he stand on guard ? And so he runs ,</l>
     <l n="223">And from a farmer 's house by telephone</l>
     <l n="224">Sends word to Coroner Merival . Then returns</l>
     <l n="225">And guards the body .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="226">Here is riffle first :</l>
     <l n="227">The coroner sat with his traveling bags ,</l>
     <l n="228">Was closing up his desk , had planned a trip</l>
     <l n="229">With boon companions , they were with him there ;</l>
     <l n="230">The auto waited at the door to take them</l>
     <l n="231">To catch the train for northern Michigan .</l>
     <l n="232">He closed the desk and they arose to go .</l>
     <l n="233">Just then the telephone began to ring ,</l>
     <l n="234">The hunter at the other end was talking ,</l>
     <l n="235">And told of Elenor Murray . Merival</l>
     <l n="236">Turned to his friends and said : “ The jig is up .</l>
     <l n="237">Here is an inquest , and of moment too .</l>
     <l n="238">I cannot go , but you jump in the car ,</l>
     <l n="239">And go — you 'll catch the train if you speed up . ”</l>
     <l n="240">They begged him to permit his deputy</l>
     <l n="241">To hold the inquest . Merival said “ no , ”</l>
     <l n="242">And waived them off . They left . He got a car</l>
     <l n="243">And hurried to the place where Eleanor lay ....</l>
     <l n="244">Now who was Merival the Coroner ?</l>
     <l n="245">For we shall know of Elenor through him ,</l>
     <l n="246">And know her better , knowing Merival .</l>

    <p>THE CORONER</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="247">Merival , of a mother fair and good ,</l>

     <l n="250">By that same father dying , mother dead</l>
     <l n="251">These many years , a bachelor , lived alone</l>
     <l n="252">In the rambling house his father built of stone</l>
     <l n="253">Cut from the quarry near at hand , above</l>

     <l n="259">Aging , relaxed his hand . From farm to farm</l>
     <l n="260">Rode daily , kept the books , bred cattle , sheep ,</l>
     <l n="261">Raised seed corn , tried the secrets of DeVries ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="263">Day by day ,</l>
     <l n="264">His duties ended , he sat at a window</l>
     <l n="265">In a great room of books where lofty shelves</l>
     <l n="266">Were packed with cracking covers ; newer books</l>
     <l n="267">Flowed over on the tables , round the globes</l>
     <l n="268">And statuettes of bronze . Upon the wall</l>
     <l n="269">The portraits hung of father and of mother ,</l>
     <l n="270">And two moose heads above the mantel stared ,</l>

     <l n="272">So Merival</l>
     <l n="273">At a bay window sat in the great room ,</l>

     <l n="275">Flow round and through him , to a sound in key</l>
     <l n="276">With his own consciousness , the murmurous voice</l>
     <l n="277">Of his own soul .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="278">Along a lawn that sloped</l>
     <l n="279">Some hundred feet to the river he would muse .</l>
     <l n="280">Or through the oaks and elms and silver birches</l>
     <l n="281">Between the plots of flowers and rows of box</l>
     <l n="282">Look at the distant scene of hilly woodlands .</l>
     <l n="283">And why no woman in his life , no face</l>
     <l n="284">Smiling from out the summer house of roses ,</l>
     <l n="285">Such riotous flames against the distant green ?</l>
     <l n="286">And why no sons and daughters , strong and fair ,</l>
     <l n="287">To use these horses , ponies , tramp the fields ,</l>
     <l n="288">Shout from the tennis court , swim , skate and row ?</l>
     <l n="289">He asked himself the question many times ,</l>
     <l n="290">And gave himself the answer . It was this :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="291">At twenty-five a woman crossed his path —</l>
     <l n="292">Let 's have the story as the world believes it ,</l>
     <l n="293">Then have the truth . She was betrothed to him ,</l>
     <l n="294">But went to France to study , died in France .</l>
     <l n="295">And so he mourned her , kept her face enshrined ,</l>
     <l n="296">Was wedded to her spirit , could not brook</l>
     <l n="297">The coming of another face to blur</l>
     <l n="298">This face of faces ! So the story went</l>
     <l n="299">Around the country . But his grief was not</l>
     <l n="300">The grief they told . The pang that gnawed his heart ,</l>
     <l n="301">And took his spirit , dulled his man 's desire</l>
     <l n="302">Took root in shame , defeat , rejected love .</l>
     <l n="303">He had gone east to meet her and to wed her ,</l>
     <l n="304">Now turned his thirtieth year ; when he arrived</l>
     <l n="305">He found his dear bride flown , a note for him ,</l>
     <l n="306">Left with the mother , saying she had flown ,</l>
     <l n="307">And could not marry him , it would not do ,</l>
     <l n="308">She did not love him as a woman should</l>
     <l n="309">Who makes a pact for life ; her heart was set</l>
     <l n="310">For now upon her music , she was off</l>
     <l n="311">To France for study , wished him well , in truth —</l>
     <l n="312">Some woman waited him who was his mate ....</l>
     <l n="313">So Merival read over many times</l>
     <l n="314">The letter , tried to find a secret hope</l>
     <l n="315">Lodged back of words — was this a woman 's way</l>
     <l n="316">To lure him further , win him to more depths ?</l>
     <l n="317">He half resolved to follow her to France ;</l>
     <l n="318">Then as he thought of what he was himself</l>
     <l n="319">In riches , breeding , place , and manliness</l>
     <l n="320">His egotism rose , fed by the hurt :</l>
     <l n="321">She might stay on in France for aught he cared !</l>
     <l n="322">What was she , anyway , that she could lose</l>
     <l n="323">Such happiness and love ? for he had given</l>
     <l n="324">In a great passion out of a passionate heart</l>
     <l n="325">All that was in him — who was she to spurn</l>
     <l n="326">A gift like this ? Yet always in his heart</l>
     <l n="327">Stirred something which by him was love and hate .</l>
     <l n="328">And when the word came she had died , the word</l>
     <l n="329">She loved a maestro , and the word like gas ,</l>
     <l n="330">Which poisons , creeps and is not known , that death</l>
     <l n="331">Came to her somehow through a lawless love ,</l>
     <l n="332">Or broken love , disaster of some sort ,</l>
     <l n="333">His spirit withered with its bitterness .</l>
     <l n="334">And in the years to come he feared to give</l>
     <l n="335">With unreserve his heart , his leaves withheld</l>
     <l n="336">From possible frost , dreamed on and drifted on</l>
     <l n="337">Afraid to venture , having scarcely strength</l>
     <l n="338">To seek and try , endure defeat again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="339">Thus was his youth unsatisfied , and as hope</l>
     <l n="340">Of something yet to be to fill his hope</l>
     <l n="341">Died not , but with each dawn awoke to move</l>
     <l n="342">Its wings , his youth continued past his years .</l>
     <l n="343">The very cry of youth , which would not cease</l>
     <l n="344">Kept all the dreams and passions of his youth</l>
     <l n="345">Wakeful , expectant — kept his face and frame</l>
     <l n="346">Rosy and agile as he neared the mark</l>
     <l n="347">Of fifty years .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="348">But every day he sat</l>
     <l n="349">As one who waited . What would come to him ?</l>
     <l n="350">What soul would seek him in this room of books ?</l>
     <l n="351">But yet no soul he found when he went forth ,</l>
     <l n="352">Breaking his solitude , to towns .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="353">What waste</l>
     <l n="354">Thought Merival , of spirit , but what waste</l>
     <l n="355">Of spirit in the lives he knew ! What homes</l>
     <l n="356">Where children starve for bread , or starve for love ,</l>
     <l n="357">Half satisfied , half-schooled are driven forth</l>
     <l n="358">With aspirations broken , or with hopes</l>
     <l n="359">Or talents bent or blasted ! O , what wives</l>
     <l n="360">Drag through the cheerless days , what marriages</l>
     <l n="361">Cling and exhaust to death , and warp and stain</l>
     <l n="362">The children ! If a business , like this farm ,</l>
     <l n="363">Were run on like economy , a year</l>
     <l n="364">Would see its ruin ! But he thought , at last ,</l>
     <l n="365">Of spiritual economy , so to save</l>
     <l n="366">The lives of men and women , use their powers</l>
     <l n="367">To ends that suit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="368">And thus when on a time</l>
     <l n="369">A miner lost his life there at LeRoy ,</l>
     <l n="370">And when the inquest found the man was killed</l>
     <l n="371">Through carelessness of self , while full of drink ,</l>
     <l n="372">Merival , knowing that the drink was caused</l>
     <l n="373">By hopeless toil and by a bitter grief</l>
     <l n="374">Touching a daughter , who had strayed and died ,</l>
     <l n="375">First wondered if in cases like to this</l>
     <l n="376">Good might result , if there was brought to light</l>
     <l n="377">All secret things ; and in the course of time ,</l>
     <l n="378">If many deaths were probed , a store of truth</l>

     <l n="381">For saving and for using wasting spirits ,</l>
     <l n="382">So wasted in the chaos , in the senseless</l>
     <l n="383">Turmoil and madness of this reckless life ,</l>

     <l n="418">So Merival</l>
     <l n="419">Returning from the river with the body</l>
     <l n="420">Of Elenor Murray thought about the woman ;</l>
     <l n="421">Recalled her school days in LeRoy — the night</l>
     <l n="422">When she was graduated at the High School ; thought</l>
     <l n="423">About her father , mother , girlhood friends ;</l>
     <l n="424">And stories of her youth came back to him .</l>
     <l n="425">The whispers of her leaving home , the trips</l>
     <l n="426">She took , her father 's loveless ways . And wonder</l>
     <l n="427">For what she did and made of self , possessed</l>
     <l n="428">His thinking ; and the fancy grew in him</l>
     <l n="429">No chance for like appraisal had been his</l>
     <l n="430">Of human worth and waste , this man who knew</l>
     <l n="431">Both life and books . And lately he had read</l>
     <l n="432">The history of King William and his book .</l>
     <l n="433">And even the night before this Elenor 's body</l>
     <l n="434">Was found beside the river — this he read ,</l>
     <l n="435">Perhaps , he thought , was reading it when Elenor</l>
     <l n="436">Was struck down or was choked . How strange the hour</l>
     <l n="437">Whose separate place finds Merival with a book ,</l>
     <l n="438">And Elenor with death , brings them together ,</l>
     <l n="439">And for result blends book and death !... He knew</l>
     <l n="440">By Domesday Book King William had a record</l>
     <l n="441">Of all the crown 's possessions , had the names</l>
     <l n="442">Of all land-holders , had the means of knowing</l>
     <l n="443">The kingdom 's strength for war ; it gave the data</l>
     <l n="444">How to increase the kingdom 's revenue .</l>
     <l n="445">It was a record in a case of titles ,</l>
     <l n="446">Disputed or at issue to appeal to .</l>
     <l n="447">So Merival could say : My inquests show</l>
     <l n="448">The country 's wealth or poverty in souls ,</l>
     <l n="449">And what the country 's strength is , who by right</l>
     <l n="450">May claim his share-ship in the country 's life ;</l>
     <l n="451">How to increase the country 's glory , power .</l>
     <l n="452">Why not a Domesday Book in which are shown</l>
     <l n="453">A certain country 's tenures spiritual ?</l>
     <l n="454">And if great William held great council once</l>
     <l n="455">To make inquiry of the nation 's wealth ,</l>
     <l n="456">Shall not I as a coroner in America ,</l>
     <l n="457">Inquiring of a woman 's death , make record</l>
     <l n="458">Of lives which have touched hers , what lives she touched ;</l>
     <l n="459">And how her death by surest logic touched</l>
     <l n="460">This life or that , was cause of causes , proved</l>

     <l n="487">About the banner in the woman 's pocket ,</l>
     <l n="488">Which Coroner Merival had taken , seen ,</l>
     <l n="489">And wondered over . For if Elenor</l>
     <l n="490">Was not a Joan too , why treasure this ?</l>
     <l n="491">Did she take Joan 's spirit for her guide ?</l>
     <l n="492">And write these words : “ To be brave and not to flinch ” ?</l>
     <l n="493">She wrote them ; for her father said : “ It 's true</l>

     <l n="496">Merival</l>
     <l n="497">Amid this business gets a telegram :</l>
     <l n="498">Tom Norman drowned , one of the men with whom</l>
     <l n="499">He planned this trip to Michigan . Later word</l>
     <l n="500">Tom Norman and the other , Wilbur Horne</l>
     <l n="501">Are in a motor-boat . Tom rises up</l>
     <l n="502">To get the can of bait and pitches out ,</l>
     <l n="503">His friend leaps out to help him . But the boat</l>
     <l n="504">Goes on , the engine going , there they fight</l>
     <l n="505">For life amid the waves . Tom has been hurt ,</l>
     <l n="506">Somehow in falling , cannot save himself ,</l>
     <l n="507">And tells his friend to leave him , swim away .</l>
     <l n="508">His friend is forced at last to swim away ,</l>
     <l n="509">And makes the mile to shore by hardest work .</l>
     <l n="510">Tom Norman , dead , leaves wife and children caught</l>
     <l n="511">In business tangles which he left to build</l>
     <l n="512">New strength , to disentangle , on the trip .</l>
     <l n="513">The rumor goes that Tom was full of drink ,</l>
     <l n="514">Thus lost his life . But if our Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="515">Had not been found beside the river , what</l>
     <l n="516">Had happened ? If the coroner had been there ,</l>
     <l n="517">And run the engine , steered the boat beside</l>
     <l n="518">The drowning man , and Wilbur Horne — what drink</l>
     <l n="519">Had caused the death of Norman ? Or again ,</l>
     <l n="520">Perhaps the death of Elenor saved the life</l>
     <l n="521">Of Merival , by keeping him at home</l>
     <l n="522">And safe from boats and waters .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="523">Anyway ,</l>
     <l n="524">As Elenor Murray 's body has no marks ,</l>
     <l n="525">And shows no cause of death , the coroner</l>
     <l n="526">Sends out for Dr . Trace and talks to him</l>
     <l n="527">Of things that end us , says to Dr . Trace</l>
     <l n="528">Perform the autopsy on Elenor Murray .</l>
     <l n="529">And while the autopsy was being made</l>
     <l n="530">By Dr . Trace , he calls the witnesses</l>
     <l n="531">The father first of Elenor Murray , who</l>
     <l n="532">Tells Merival this story :</l>
    </lg>
    <p>HENRY MURRAY</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="533">Henry Murray , father of Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="534">Willing to tell the coroner Merival</l>
     <l n="535">All things about himself , about his wife ,</l>
     <l n="536">All things as well about his daughter , touching</l>
     <l n="537">Her growth , and home life , if the coroner</l>
     <l n="538">Would hear him privately , save on such things</l>
     <l n="539">Strictly relating to the inquest , went</l>
     <l n="540">To Coroner Merival 's office and thus spoke :</l>
     <l n="541">I was born here some sixty years ago ,</l>
     <l n="542">Was nurtured in these common schools , too poor</l>
     <l n="543">To satisfy a longing for a college .</l>
     <l n="544">Felt myself gifted with some gifts of mind ,</l>
     <l n="545">Some fineness of perception , thought , began</l>
     <l n="546">By twenty years to gather books and read</l>
     <l n="547">Some history , philosophy and science .</l>
     <l n="548">Had vague ambitions , analyzed perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="549">To learn , be wise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="550">Now if you study me ,</l>
     <l n="551">Look at my face , you 'll see some trace of her :</l>
     <l n="552">My brow is hers , my mouth is hers , my eyes</l>
     <l n="553">Of lighter color are yet hers , this way</l>
     <l n="554">I have of laughing , as I saw inside</l>
     <l n="555">The matter deeper cause for laughter , hers .</l>
     <l n="556">And my jaw hers betokening a will ,</l>
     <l n="557">Hers too , with chin that mitigates the will ,</l>
     <l n="558">Shading to softness as hers did .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="559">Our minds</l>
     <l n="560">Had something too in common : first this will</l>
     <l n="561">Which tempted fate to bend it , break it too —</l>
     <l n="562">I know not why in her case or in mine .</l>
     <l n="563">But when my will is bent I grow morose ,</l>
     <l n="564">And when it 's broken , I become a scourge</l>
     <l n="565">To all around me . Yes , I 've visited</l>
     <l n="566">A life-time 's wrath upon my wife . This daughter</l>
     <l n="567">When finding will subdued did not give up ,</l>
     <l n="568">But took the will for something else — went on</l>
     <l n="569">By ways more prosperous ; but alas ! poor me !</l>
     <l n="570">I hold on when defeated , and lie down</l>
     <l n="571">When I am beaten , growling , ruminate</l>
     <l n="572">Upon my failure , think of nothing else .</l>
     <l n="573">But truth to tell , while we two were opposed ,</l>
     <l n="574">This daughter and myself , while temperaments</l>
     <l n="575">Kept us at sword 's points , while I saw in her</l>
     <l n="576">Traits of myself I liked not , also traits</l>
     <l n="577">Of the child 's mother which I loathe , because</l>
     <l n="578">They have undone me , helped at least — no less</l>
     <l n="579">I see this child as better than myself ,</l>
     <l n="580">And better than her mother , so admire .</l>
     <l n="581">Also I never trusted her ; as a child</l>
     <l n="582">She would rush in relating lying wonders ;</l>
     <l n="583">She feigned emotions , purposes and moods ;</l>
     <l n="584">She was a little actress from the first ,</l>
     <l n="585">And all her high resolves from first to last</l>
     <l n="586">Seemed but a robe with flowing sleeves in which</l>
     <l n="587">Her hands could hide some theft , some secret spoil .</l>
     <l n="588">When she was fourteen I could see in her</l>
     <l n="589">The passionate nature of her mother — well</l>
     <l n="590">You know a father 's feelings when he sees</l>
     <l n="591">His daughter sensed by youths and lusty men</l>
     <l n="592">As one of the kind for capture . It 's a theme</l>
     <l n="593">A father cannot talk of with his daughter .</l>
     <l n="594">He may say , “ have a care , ” or “ I forbid</l>
     <l n="595">Your strolling , riding with these boys at night . ”</l>
     <l n="596">But if the daughter stands and eyes the father ,</l>
     <l n="597">As she did me with flaming eyes , then goes</l>
     <l n="598">Her way in secret , lies about her ways ,</l>
     <l n="599">The father can but wonder , watch or brood ,</l>
     <l n="600">Or switch her maybe , for I switched her once ,</l>
     <l n="601">And found it did no good . I needed here</l>
     <l n="602">The mother 's aid , but no , her mother saw</l>
     <l n="603">Herself in the girl , and said she knew the girl ,</l>
     <l n="604">That I was too suspicious , out of touch</l>
     <l n="605">With a young girl 's life , desire for happiness .</l>
     <l n="606">But when this Alma Bell affair came up ,</l>
     <l n="607">And the school principal took pains to say</l>
     <l n="608">My daughter was too reckless of her name</l>
     <l n="609">In strolling and in riding , then my wife</l>
     <l n="610">Howled at me like a tigress : whip that man !</l>
     <l n="611">And as my daughter cried , and my wife screeched ,</l>
     <l n="612">And called me coward if I let him go ,</l>
     <l n="613">I rushed out to the street and finding him</l>
     <l n="614">Beat up his face , though almost dropping dead</l>
     <l n="615">From my exertion . Well , the aftermath</l>
     <l n="616">Was worse for me , not only by the talk ,</l>
     <l n="617">But in my mind who saw no gratitude</l>
     <l n="618">In daughter or in mother for my deed .</l>
     <l n="619">The daughter from that day took up a course</l>
     <l n="620">More secret from my eyes , more variant</l>
     <l n="621">From any wish I had . We stood apart ,</l>
     <l n="622">And grew apart thereafter . And from that day</l>
     <l n="623">My wife grew worse in temper , worse in nerves .</l>
     <l n="624">And though the people say she is my slave ,</l>
     <l n="625">That I alone , of all who live , have conquered</l>
     <l n="626">Her spirit , still what despotism works</l>
     <l n="627">Free of reprisals , or of breakings-forth</l>
     <l n="628">When hands are here , not there ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="629">But to return :</l>
     <l n="630">One takes up something for a livelihood ,</l>
     <l n="631">And dreams he 'll leave it later , when in time</l>
     <l n="632">His plans mature ; and as he earns and lives ,</l>
     <l n="633">With some time for his plans , hopes for the day</l>
     <l n="634">When he may step forth from his olden life</l>
     <l n="635">Into a new life made thus gradually ,</l>
     <l n="636">I hoped to be a lawyer ; but to live</l>
     <l n="637">I started as a drug clerk — look to-day</l>
     <l n="638">I own that little drug store — here I am</l>
     <l n="639">With drugs my years through , drugged myself at last .</l>
     <l n="640">And as a clerk I met my wife — went mad</l>
     <l n="641">About her , and I see in Elenor</l>
     <l n="642">Her mother 's gift for making fools of men .</l>
     <l n="643">Why , I can scarce explain it , it 's the flesh ,</l>
     <l n="644">But then it 's spirit too . Such flaming up</l>
     <l n="645">As came from flames like ours , but more of hers</l>
     <l n="646">Burned in the children . Yes , it might be well</l>

     <l n="648">About the matter .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="649">Well , but how about</l>
     <l n="650">The flames that make the children ? For this woman</l>
     <l n="651">Too surely ruined me and sapped my life .</l>
     <l n="652">You hear much of the vampire , but what wife</l>
     <l n="653">Has not more chance for eating up a man ?</l>
     <l n="654">She has him daily , has him fast for years .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="43">
     <l n="655">A man can shake a vampire off , but how</l>
     <l n="656">To shake a wife off , when the children come ,</l>
     <l n="657">And you must leave your place , your livelihood</l>
     <l n="658">To shake her off ? And if you shake her off</l>
     <l n="659">Where do you go ? what do you do ? and how ?</l>
     <l n="660">You see ‘ twas love that caught me , yet even so</l>
     <l n="661">I had resisted love had I not seen</l>
     <l n="662">A chance to rise through marriage . It was this :</l>
     <l n="663">You know , of course , my wife was Elenor Fouche ,</l>
     <l n="664">Daughter of Arthur , thought to be so rich .</l>
     <l n="665">And I had hopes to patch my fortunes up</l>
     <l n="666">In this alliance , and become a lawyer .</l>
     <l n="667">What happened ? Why they helped me not at all .</l>
     <l n="668">The children came , and I was chained to work ,</l>
     <l n="669">To clothe and feed a family — all the while</l>
     <l n="670">My soul combusted with this aspiration ,</l>
     <l n="671">And my good nature went to ashes , dampened</l>
     <l n="672">By secret tears which filtered through as lye .</l>
     <l n="673">Then finally , when my wife 's father died ,</l>
     <l n="674">After our marriage , twenty years or so ,</l>
     <l n="675">His fortune came to nothing , all she got</l>
     <l n="676">Went to that little house we live in here —</l>
     <l n="677">It needs paint now , the porch has rotten boards —</l>
     <l n="678">And I was forced to see these children learn</l>
     <l n="679">What public schools could teach , and even as I</l>
     <l n="680">Left school half taught , and never went to college ,</l>
     <l n="681">So did these children , saving Elenor ,</l>
     <l n="682">Who saw two years of college — earned herself</l>
     <l n="683">By teaching . I choke up , just wait a minute !</l>
     <l n="684">What depths of calmness may a man come to</l>
     <l n="685">As father , who can think of this and be</l>
     <l n="686">Quiet about his heart ? His heart will hurt ,</l>
     <l n="687">Move , as it were , as a worm does with its pain .</l>
     <l n="688">And these days now , when trembling hands and head</l>
     <l n="689">Foretell decline , or worse , and make me think</l>
     <l n="690">As face to face with God , most earnestly ,</l>
     <l n="691">Most eager for the truth , I wonder much</l>
     <l n="692">If I misjudged this daughter , canvass her</l>
     <l n="693">Myself to see if I had power to do</l>
     <l n="694">A better part by her . That is the way</l>
     <l n="695">This daughter has got in my soul . At first</l>
     <l n="696">She incubates in me as force unknown ,</l>
     <l n="697">A spirit strange yet kindred , in my life ;</l>
     <l n="698">And we are hostile and yet drawn together ;</l>
     <l n="699">But when we 're drawn together see and feel</l>
     <l n="700">These oppositions . Next she 's in my life —</l>
     <l n="701">The second stage of the fever — as dislike ,</l>
     <l n="702">Repugnance , and I wish her out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="703">Out of my life . Then comes these ugly things ,</l>
     <l n="704">Like Alma Bell , and rumors from away</l>
     <l n="705">Where she is teaching , and I put her out</l>
     <l n="706">Of life and thought the more , and wonder why</l>
     <l n="707">I fathered such a nature , whence it came .</l>
     <l n="708">Well , then the fever goes and I am weak ,</l>
     <l n="709">Repentant it may be , delirious visions</l>
     <l n="710">That haunted me in fever plague me yet ,</l>
     <l n="711">Even while I think them visions , nothing else .</l>
     <l n="712">So I grow pitiful and blame myself</l>
     <l n="713">For any part I had in her mistakes ,</l>
     <l n="714">Sorrows and struggles , and I curse myself</l>
     <l n="715">That I was powerless to help her more —</l>
     <l n="716">Thus is she like a fever in my life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="44">
     <l n="717">Well , then the child grows up . But as a child</l>
     <l n="718">She dances , laughs and sings . At three years springs</l>
     <l n="719">For minutes and for minutes on her toes ,</l>
     <l n="720">Like skipping rope , clapping her hands the while ,</l>
     <l n="721">Her blue eyes twinkling , and her milk-white teeth</l>
     <l n="722">Glistening as she gurgled , shouted , laughed —</l>
     <l n="723">There never was such vital strength . I give</l>
     <l n="724">The pictures as my memory took them . Next</l>
     <l n="725">I see her looking side-ways at me , as if</l>
     <l n="726">She studied me , avoided me . The child</l>
     <l n="727">Is now ten years of age ; and now I know</l>
     <l n="728">She smelled the rats that made the family hearth</l>
     <l n="729">A place for scampering ; the horrors of our home .</l>
     <l n="730">She thought I brought the rats and kept them there ,</l>
     <l n="731">These rats of bickering , anger , strife at home .</l>
     <l n="732">I knew she blamed me for her mother 's moods</l>
     <l n="733">Who dragged about the kitchen day by day ,</l>
     <l n="734">Sad faced and silent . So the upshot was</l>
     <l n="735">I had two enemies in the house , where once</l>
     <l n="736">I had but one , her mother . This made worse</l>
     <l n="737">The state for both , and worse the state for me .</l>
     <l n="738">And so it goes . Then next there 's Alma Bell .</l>
     <l n="739">The following year my daughter finished up</l>
     <l n="740">The High School — and we sit — my wife and I</l>
     <l n="741">To see the exercises . And that summer Elenor ,</l>
     <l n="742">Now eighteen and a woman , goes about —</l>
     <l n="743">I do n't know what she does , sometimes I see</l>
     <l n="744">Some young man with her walking . But at home ,</l>
     <l n="745">When I come in , the mother and the daughter</l>
     <l n="746">Put pedals on their talk , or change the theme —</l>
     <l n="747">I am shut out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="45">
     <l n="748">And in the fall I learn</l>
     <l n="749">From some outsider that she 's teaching school ,</l>
     <l n="750">And later people laugh and talk to me</l>
     <l n="751">About her feat of cowing certain Czechs ,</l>
     <l n="752">Who broke her discipline in school .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="46">
     <l n="753">Well , then</l>

     <l n="769">For making High School possible to her ,</l>

     <l n="771">To go to college , that she will gain strength</l>

    <p>MRS. MURRAY</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="55">
     <l n="881">I think , she said at first ,</l>
     <l n="882">My daughter did not kill herself . I 'm sure</l>
     <l n="883">Someone did violence to her , your tests ,</l>
     <l n="884">Examination will prove violence .</l>
     <l n="885">It would be like her fate to meet with such :</l>
     <l n="886">Poor child , unfortunate from birth , at least</l>
     <l n="887">Unfortunate in fortune , peace and joy .</l>
     <l n="888">Or else if she met with no violence ,</l>
     <l n="889">Some sudden crisis of her woman 's heart</l>
     <l n="890">Came on her by the river , the result</l>
     <l n="891">Of strains and labors in the war in France .</l>
     <l n="892">I 'll tell you why I say this : First I knew</l>
     <l n="893">She had come near me from New York , there came</l>
     <l n="894">A letter from her , saying she had come</l>
     <l n="895">To visit with her aunt there near LeRoy ,</l>
     <l n="896">And rest and get the country air . She said</l>
     <l n="897">To keep it secret , not to tell her father ;</l>
     <l n="898">That she was in no frame of mind to come</l>
     <l n="899">And be with us , and see her father , see</l>
     <l n="900">Our life , which is the same as it was when</l>
     <l n="901">She was a child and after . But she said</l>
     <l n="902">To come to her . And so the day before</l>
     <l n="903">They found her by the river I went over</l>
     <l n="904">And saw her for the day . She seemed most gay ,</l>
     <l n="905">Gave me the presents which she brought from France ,</l>
     <l n="906">Told me of many things , but rather more</l>
     <l n="907">By way of half told things than something told</l>
     <l n="908">Continuously , you know . She had grown fairer ,</l>
     <l n="909">She had a majesty of countenance ,</l>
     <l n="910">A luminous glory shone about her face ,</l>
     <l n="911">Her voice was softer , eyes looked tenderer .</l>
     <l n="912">She held my hands so lovingly when we met .</l>
     <l n="913">She kissed me with such silent , speaking love .</l>
     <l n="914">But then she laughed and told me funny stories .</l>
     <l n="915">She seemed all hope , and said she 'd rest awhile</l>
     <l n="916">Before she made a plan for life again .</l>
     <l n="917">And when we parted , she said : “ Mother , think</l>
     <l n="918">What trip you 'd like to take . I 've saved some money ,</l>
     <l n="919">And you must have a trip , a rest , construct</l>
     <l n="920">Yourself anew for life . ” So , as I said ,</l>
     <l n="921">She came to death by violence , or else</l>
     <l n="922">She had some weakness that she hid from me</l>
     <l n="923">Which came upon her quickly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="56">
     <l n="924">For the rest ,</l>
     <l n="925">Suppose I told you all my life , and told</l>
     <l n="926">What was my waste in life and what in hers ,</l>
     <l n="927">How I have lived , and how poor Elenor</l>
     <l n="928">Was raised or half-raised — what 's the good of that ?</l>
     <l n="929">Are not there rooms of books , of tales and poems</l>
     <l n="930">And histories to show all secrets of life ?</l>
     <l n="931">Does anyone live now , or learn a thing</l>
     <l n="932">Not lived and learned a thousand times before ?</l>
     <l n="933">The trouble is these secrets are locked up</l>
     <l n="934">In books and might as well be locked in graves ,</l>
     <l n="935">Since they mean nothing till you live yourself .</l>
     <l n="936">And I suppose the race will live and suffer</l>

     <l n="1046">Our story started then . To sate their rage</l>
     <l n="1047">My father and my mother cut me off ,</l>
     <l n="1048">And so we had bread problems from the first .</l>
     <l n="1049">He made but little clerking in the store ,</l>
     <l n="1050">Besides his mind was on the law and books .</l>
     <l n="1051">These were the early tangles of our yarn .</l>
     <l n="1052">And I grew worried as the children came ,</l>
     <l n="1053">Two sons at first , and I was far from well ,</l>
     <l n="1054">One died at five years , and I almost died</l>
     <l n="1055">For grief at this . But down below all things ,</l>
     <l n="1056">Far down below all tune or scheme of sound ,</l>
     <l n="1057">Where no rests were , but only ceaseless dirge ,</l>
     <l n="1058">Was my heart 's de profundis , crying out</l>
     <l n="1059">My thirst for love , not thirst for his , but thirst</l>
     <l n="1060">For love that quenched it . But the only water</l>
     <l n="1061">That passed my lips was desert water , poisoned</l>
     <l n="1062">By arsenic from his rocks . My soul grew bitter ,</l>
     <l n="1063">Then sweetened under the cross , grew bitter again .</l>
     <l n="1064">My life lay raving on the desert sands .</l>
     <l n="1065">To speak more plainly , sleep deserted me .</l>
     <l n="1066">I could not sleep for thought , and for a will</l>
     <l n="1067">That could not bend , but hoped that death or something</l>
     <l n="1068">Would take him from me , bring me love before</l>
     <l n="1069">My face was withered , as it is to-day .</l>
     <l n="1070">At last the doctor found me growing mad</l>
     <l n="1071">For lack of sleep . Why was I so , he asked .</l>
     <l n="1072">You must give up this psychic work and quit</l>
     <l n="1073">This psychic writing , let the spirits go .</l>
     <l n="1074">Well , it was true that years before I found</l>
     <l n="1075">I heard and saw with higher power , received</l>
     <l n="1076">Deep messages from spirits , from my boy</l>
     <l n="1077">Who passed away . And as to this , who knows ?—</l>
     <l n="1078">Surely no doctor — of this psychic power .</l>
     <l n="1079">You may be called neurotic , what is that ?</l>
     <l n="1080">Perhaps it is the soul become so fine</l>
     <l n="1081">It leaves the body , or shakes down the body</l>
     <l n="1082">With energy too subtle for the body .</l>
     <l n="1083">But I was sleepless for these years , at last</l>
     <l n="1084">The secret lost of sleep , for seven days</l>
     <l n="1085">And seven nights could find no sleep , until</l>
     <l n="1086">I lay upon the lawn and pushed my head ,</l>
     <l n="1087">As a dog does around , around , around .</l>
     <l n="1088">There was a devil in me , at one with me ,</l>
     <l n="1089">And neither to be put out , nor yet subdued</l>
     <l n="1090">By help outside , and nothing to be done</l>
     <l n="1091">Except to find escape by knife , or pistol ,</l>
     <l n="1092">And thus get sleep . Escape ! Oh , that 's the word !</l>
     <l n="1093">There 's something in the soul that says escape !</l>
     <l n="1094">Fly , fly from something , and in truth , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="1095">Life 's restlessness , however healthful it be ,</l>
     <l n="1096">Is motived by this urge to fly , escape :</l>
     <l n="1097">Well , to go on , they gave me everything ,</l>
     <l n="1098">At last they gave me chloral , but no sleep !</l>
     <l n="1099">And finally I closed my eyes and quick</l>
     <l n="1100">The secret came to me , as one might find ,</l>
     <l n="1101">After forgetting how , to swim , or walk ,</l>
     <l n="1102">After a sickness , and for just two minutes</l>
     <l n="1103">I slept , and then I got the secret back ,</l>
     <l n="1104">And later slept .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="63">
     <l n="1105">So I possessed myself .</l>
     <l n="1106">But for these years sleep but two hours or so .</l>
     <l n="1107">Why do I wake ? The spirits let me sleep .</l>
     <l n="1108">Oh , no it is my longing that will rest not ,</l>
     <l n="1109">These thoughts of him that rest not , and this love</l>
     <l n="1110">That never has been satisfied , this heart</l>
     <l n="1111">So empty all these years ; the bitterness</l>
     <l n="1112">Of living face to face with one you loathe ,</l>
     <l n="1113">Yet pity , while you hate yourself for feeling</l>
     <l n="1114">Such bitterness toward another soul ,</l>
     <l n="1115">As wretched as your own . But then as well</l>
     <l n="1116">I could not sleep for Elenor , for her fate ,</l>
     <l n="1117">Never to have a chance in life . I saw</l>
     <l n="1118">Our poverty made surer ; year by year</l>

     <l n="1121">When I first felt her lips that sucked my breasts</l>

     <l n="1123">To pour its whole song in one note and fails</l>
     <l n="1124">Out of its very ecstasy . A daughter ,</l>

     <l n="1630">Of beauty and of hope ! For not her life</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="101">
     <l n="1729">Then his mind</l>

     <l n="1734">In absence with long letters , when together</l>
     <l n="1735">With passionate utterances of love . The girl</l>
     <l n="1736">Loved Gregory Wenner , but the girl had found</l>
     <l n="1737">A comfort for her spiritual solitude ,</l>
     <l n="1738">And got a strength in taking Wenner 's strength .</l>
     <l n="1739">For at the last one soul lives on another .</l>

     <l n="1754">Elenor Murray 's training as a nurse ,</l>
     <l n="1755">By this to set her free from teaching school ,</l>

     <l n="1761">And saw his mind diffuse itself in worries ,</l>
     <l n="1762">In longing for her : found himself at times</l>

     <l n="1773">Just as it lacked the medium to discharge</l>
     <l n="1774">The great emotion it created , Wenner</l>
     <l n="1775">Caught up his shreds of strength to crush her out</l>
     <l n="1776">Of his life , told her so , when he had raised</l>
     <l n="1777">The money for her training . For he saw</l>

     <l n="1779">Pass by the woman , whom the world would judge</l>
     <l n="1780">As ruined long ago . But look , he thought ,</l>

    <head>MRS. GREGORY WENNER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Gregory Wenner 's wife was by the sea</l>
     <l n="2">When Gregory Wenner killed himself , half sick</l>
     <l n="3">And half malingering , and otiose .</l>
     <l n="4">She wept , sent for a doctor to be braced ,</l>
     <l n="5">Induced a friend to travel with her west</l>
     <l n="6">To bury Gregory Wenner ; did not know</l>
     <l n="7">That Gregory Wenner was in money straits</l>
     <l n="8">Until she read the paper , or had lost</l>
     <l n="9">His building in the loop . The man had kept</l>
     <l n="10">His worries from her ailing ears , was glad</l>
     <l n="11">To keep her traveling , or taking cures .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">She came and buried Gregory Wenner ; found</l>
     <l n="13">His fortune just a shell , the building lost ,</l>
     <l n="14">A little money in the bank , a store</l>
     <l n="15">Far out on Lake Street , forty worthless acres</l>
     <l n="16">In northern Indiana , twenty lots</l>
     <l n="17">In some Montana village . Here she was ,</l>
     <l n="18">A widow , penniless , an invalid .</l>
     <l n="19">The crude reality of things awoke</l>
     <l n="20">A strength she did not dream was hers . And then</l>
     <l n="21">She went to Gregory Wenner 's barren office</l>
     <l n="22">To collect the things he had , get in his safe</l>
     <l n="23">For papers and effects .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="24">She had to pay</l>
     <l n="25">An expert to reveal the combination ,</l>
     <l n="26">And throw the bolts . And there she sat a day ,</l>
     <l n="27">And emptied pigeon holes and searched and read .</l>
     <l n="28">And in one pigeon hole she found a box ,</l>
     <l n="29">And in the box a lock of hair wrapped up</l>
     <l n="30">In tissue paper , fragrant powder lying</l>
     <l n="31">Around the paper — in the box a card</l>
     <l n="32">With woman 's writing on it , just the words</l>
     <l n="33">“ For my beloved ” ; but no name or date .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">Who was this woman mused the widow there ?</l>
     <l n="35">She did not know the name . She did not know</l>
     <l n="36">Her eyes had seen this Elenor Murray once</l>
     <l n="37">When Elenor Murray came with Gregory Wenner</l>
     <l n="38">To dinner at his home to face the wife .</l>
     <l n="39">For Elenor Murray in a mood of strength ,</l>
     <l n="40">After her confirmation and communion ,</l>
     <l n="41">Had said to Gregory Wenner : “ Now the end</l>
     <l n="42">Has come to this , our love , I think it best</l>
     <l n="43">If she should ever learn I am the woman</l>
     <l n="44">Who in New York spent summer days with you ,</l>
     <l n="45">And later in Chicago , in that summer ,</l>
     <l n="46">She will remember what my eyes will show</l>
     <l n="47">When we stand face to face , and I give proof</l>
     <l n="48">That I am changed , repentant . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="49">For the wife</l>
     <l n="50">Had listened to a friend who came to tell</l>
     <l n="51">She saw this Gregory Wenner in New York</l>
     <l n="52">From day to day in gardens and cafes ,</l>
     <l n="53">And by the sea romancing with a girl .</l>
     <l n="54">And later Mrs. Wenner found a book ,</l>
     <l n="55">Which Gregory Wenner cherished — with the words</l>
     <l n="56">Beloved , and the date . And now she knew</l>
     <l n="57">The hand that wrote the card here in this box ,</l>
     <l n="58">The hand that wrote the inscription in the book</l>
     <l n="59">Were one — but still she did not know the woman .</l>
     <l n="60">No doubt the woman of that summer 's flame ,</l>
     <l n="61">Whom Gregory Wenner promised not to see</l>
     <l n="62">When she brought out the book and told him all</l>
     <l n="63">She learned of his philandering in New York .</l>
     <l n="64">And Elenor Murray 's body was decaying</l>
     <l n="65">In darkness , under earth there at LeRoy</l>
     <l n="66">While Mrs. Wenner read , and did not know</l>
     <l n="67">The hand that wrote the card lay blue and green ,</l>
     <l n="68">Half hidden in the foldings of the shroud ,</l>
     <l n="69">And all that country stirred for Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="70">Of which the widow absent in the east</l>
     <l n="71">Had never heard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="72">And Mrs. Wenner found</l>
     <l n="73">Beside the box and lock of hair three letters ,</l>
     <l n="74">And sat and read them . Through her eyes and brain</l>
     <l n="75">This meaning and this sound of blood and soul ,</l>
     <l n="76">Like an old record with a diamond needle .</l>
     <l n="77">Passed music like :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="78">“ The days go swiftly by</l>
     <l n="79">With study and with work . I am too tired</l>
     <l n="80">At night to think . I read anatomy ,</l>
     <l n="81">Materia medica and other things ,</l>
     <l n="82">And do the work an undergraduate</l>
     <l n="83">Is called upon to do . And every week</l>
     <l n="84">I spend three afternoons with the nuns and sew ,</l>
     <l n="85">And care for children of the poor whose mothers</l>
     <l n="86">Are earning bread away . I go to church</l>
     <l n="87">And talk with Mother Janet . And I pray</l>
     <l n="88">At morning and at night for you , and ask</l>
     <l n="89">For strength to live without you and for light</l>
     <l n="90">To understand why love of you is mine ,</l>
     <l n="91">And why you are not mine , and whether God</l>
     <l n="92">Will give you to me some day if I prove</l>
     <l n="93">My womanhood is worthy of you , dear .</l>
     <l n="94">And sometimes when our days of bliss come back</l>
     <l n="95">And flood me with their warmth and blinding light</l>
     <l n="96">I take my little crucifix and kiss it ,</l>
     <l n="97">And plunge in work to take me out of self ,</l>
     <l n="98">Some service to another . So it is ,</l>
     <l n="99">This sewing and this caring for the children</l>
     <l n="100">Stills memory and gives me strength to live ,</l>
     <l n="101">And pass the days , go on . I shall not draw</l>
     <l n="102">Upon your thought with letters , still I ask</l>
     <l n="103">Your thought of me sometimes . Would it be much</l>
     <l n="104">If once a year you sent me a bouquet</l>
     <l n="105">To prove to me that you remember , sweet ,</l>
     <l n="106">Still cherish me a little , give me faith</l>
     <l n="107">That in this riddle world there is a hand ,</l>
     <l n="108">Which spite of separation , thinks and touches</l>
     <l n="109">Blossoms that I touch afterward ? Dear heart ,</l>
     <l n="110">I have starved out and killed that reckless mood</l>
     <l n="111">Which would have taken you and run away .</l>
     <l n="112">Oh , if you knew that this means killing , too ,</l>
     <l n="113">The child I want — our child . You have a cross</l>
     <l n="114">No less than I , beloved , even if love</l>
     <l n="115">Of me has passed and eased the agony</l>
     <l n="116">I thought you knew — your cross is heavy , dear ,</l>
     <l n="117">Bound , but not wedded to her , never to know</l>
     <l n="118">The life of marriage with her . Yet be brave ,</l>
     <l n="119">Be noble , dear , be always what God made you ,</l>
     <l n="120">A great heart , patient , gentle , sacrificing ,</l>
     <l n="121">Bring comfort to her tedious days , forbear</l>
     <l n="122">When she is petulant , for if you do ,</l>
     <l n="123">I know God will reward you , give you peace .</l>
     <l n="124">I pray for strength for you , that never again</l>
     <l n="125">May you distress her as you did , I did</l>
     <l n="126">When she found there was someone . Lest she know</l>
     <l n="127">Destroy this letter , all I ever write ,</l>
     <l n="128">So that her mind may never fix itself</l>
     <l n="129">Upon a definite person , on myself .</l>
     <l n="130">But still remaining vague may better pass</l>
     <l n="131">To lighter shadows , nothingness at last .</l>
     <l n="132">I try to think I sinned , have so confessed</l>
     <l n="133">To get forgiveness at my first communion .</l>
     <l n="134">And yet a vestige of a thought in me</l>
     <l n="135">Will not submit , confess the sin . Well , dear ,</l>
     <l n="136">You can awake at midnight , at the pause</l>
     <l n="137">Of duty in the day , merry or sad ,</l>
     <l n="138">Light hearted or discouraged , if you chance ,</l>
     <l n="139">To think of me , remember I send prayers</l>
     <l n="140">To God for you each day — oh may His light</l>
     <l n="141">Shine on your face ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="142">So Widow Wenner read ,</l>
     <l n="143">And wondered of the writer , since no name</l>
     <l n="144">Was signed ; and wept a little , dried her eyes</l>
     <l n="145">And flushed with anger , said , “ adulteress ,</l>
     <l n="146">Adulteress who played the game of pity ,</l>
     <l n="147">And wove about my husband 's heart the spell</l>
     <l n="148">Of masculine sympathy for a sorrowing woman ,</l>
     <l n="149">A trick as old as Eden . And who knows</l>
     <l n="150">But all the money went here in the end ?</l>
     <l n="151">For if a woman plunges from her aim</l>
     <l n="152">To piety , devotion such as this ,</l>
     <l n="153">She will plunge back to sin , unstable heart ,</l>
     <l n="154">That swings from self-denial to indulgence</l>
     <l n="155">And spends itself in both . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="156">Then Widow Wenner</l>
     <l n="157">Took up the second letter :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="158">“ I have signed</l>
     <l n="159">To go to France to-day . I wrote you once</l>
     <l n="160">I planned to take the veil , become a nun .</l>
     <l n="161">But now the war has changed my thought . I see</l>
     <l n="162">In service for my country fuller life ,</l>
     <l n="163">More useful sacrifice and greater work</l>
     <l n="164">Than ever I could have , being a nun .</l>
     <l n="165">The cause is so momentous . Think , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="166">This woman who still thinks of you will be</l>
     <l n="167">A factor in this war for liberty ,</l>
     <l n="168">A soldier serving soldiers , giving strength ,</l>
     <l n="169">Health , hope and spirit to the soldier boys</l>
     <l n="170">Who fall , must be restored to fight again .</l>
     <l n="171">I 've thrown my soul in this , am all aflame .</l>
     <l n="172">You should have seen me when I took the oath ,</l>
     <l n="173">And raised my hand and pledged my word to serve ,</l>
     <l n="174">Support the law . I want to think of you</l>
     <l n="175">As proud of me for doing this — be proud ,</l>
     <l n="176">Be grateful , too , that I have strength and will</l>
     <l n="177">To give myself to this . And if it chance ,</l>
     <l n="178">As almost I am hoping , that the work</l>
     <l n="179">Should break me , sweep me under , think of me</l>
     <l n="180">As one who died for country , as I shall</l>
     <l n="181">As truly as the soldiers slain in battle .</l>
     <l n="182">I leave to-morrow , will be at a camp</l>
     <l n="183">Some weeks before I sail . I telephoned you</l>
     <l n="184">This morning twice , they said you would return</l>
     <l n="185">By two-o'clock at least . I write instead .</l>
     <l n="186">But I shall come to see you , if I can</l>
     <l n="187">Sometime this afternoon , and if I do n't ,</l>
     <l n="188">This letter then must answer . Peace be with you .</l>
     <l n="189">To-day I 'm very happy . Write to me ,</l>
     <l n="190">Or if you do not think it best , all right ,</l>
     <l n="191">I 'll understand . Before I sail I 'll send</l>
     <l n="192">A message to you — for the time farewell . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="193">Then Widow Wenner read the telegram</l>
     <l n="194">The third and last communication : “ Sail</l>
     <l n="195">To-day , to-morrow , very soon , I know .</l>
     <l n="196">My memories of you are happy ones .</l>
     <l n="197">A fond adieu . ” This telegram was signed</l>
     <l n="198">By Elenor Murray . Widow Wenner knew</l>
     <l n="199">The name at last , sat petrified to think</l>
     <l n="200">This was the girl who brazened through the dinner</l>
     <l n="201">Some years ago when Gregory Wenner brought</l>
     <l n="202">This woman to his home — “ the shameless trull , ”</l>
     <l n="203">Said Mrs. Wenner , “ harlot , impudent jade ,</l>
     <l n="204">To think my husband is dead , would she were dead —</l>
     <l n="205">I could be happy if I knew a bomb</l>
     <l n="206">Or vile disease had got her . ” Then she looked</l>
     <l n="207">In other pigeon holes , and found in one</l>
     <l n="208">A photograph of Elenor Murray , knew</l>
     <l n="209">The face that looked across the dinner table .</l>
     <l n="210">And in the pigeon hole she found some verses</l>
     <l n="211">Clipped from a magazine , and tucked away</l>
     <l n="212">The letters , verses , telegram in her bag ,</l>
     <l n="213">Closed up the safe and left .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="214">Next day at breakfast</l>
     <l n="215">She scanned the morning Times , her eyes were wide</l>
     <l n="216">For reading of the Elenor Murray inquest .</l>
     <l n="217">“ Well , God is just , ” she murmured , “ God is just . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="218">All this was learned of Gregory Wenner . Even</l>
     <l n="219">If Gregory Wenner killed the girl , the man</l>
     <l n="220">Was dead now . Could he kill her and return</l>
     <l n="221">And kill himself ? The coroner had gone ,</l>
     <l n="222">The jury too , to view the spot where lay</l>
     <l n="223">Elenor Murray 's body . It was clear</l>
     <l n="224">A man had walked here . Was it Gregory Wenner ?</l>
     <l n="225">The hunter who came up and found the body ?</l>
     <l n="226">This hunter was a harmless , honest soul</l>
     <l n="227">Could not have killed her , passed the grill of questions</l>
     <l n="228">From David Borrow , skilled examiner ,</l>
     <l n="229">The coroner , the jurors . But meantime</l>
     <l n="230">If Gregory Wenner killed this Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="231">How did he do it ? Dr . Trace has made</l>
     <l n="232">His autopsy and comes and makes report</l>
     <l n="233">To the coroner and the jury in these words :—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I cannot tell you , Coroner , the cause</l>
     <l n="2">Of death of Elenor Murray , not until</l>
     <l n="3">My chemical analysis is finished .</l>
     <l n="4">Here is the woman 's heart sealed in this jar ,</l>
     <l n="5">I weighed it , weight nine ounces , if she had</l>
     <l n="6">A hemolysis , cannot tell you now</l>
     <l n="7">What caused the hemolysis . Since you say</l>
     <l n="8">She took no castor oil , that you can learn</l>
     <l n="9">From Irma Leese , or any witness , still</l>
     <l n="10">A chemical analysis may show</l>
     <l n="11">The presence of ricin ,— and that she took</l>
     <l n="12">A dose of oil not pure . Her throat betrayed</l>
     <l n="13">Slight inflammation ; but in brief , I wait</l>
     <l n="14">My chemical analysis .</l>

     <l n="15">Let 's exclude</l>
     <l n="16">The things we know and narrow down the facts .</l>
     <l n="17">She lay there by the river , death had come</l>
     <l n="18">Some twenty hours before . No stick or stone ,</l>
     <l n="19">No weapon near her , bottle , poison box ,</l>
     <l n="20">No bruise upon her , in her mouth no dust ,</l>
     <l n="21">No foreign bodies in her nostrils , neck</l>

     <l n="23">Upon her anywhere , no water in lungs ,</l>
     <l n="24">No mud , sand , straws or weeds in hands , the nails</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="26">Again</l>
     <l n="27">No evidence of rape . I first examined</l>
     <l n="28">The genitals in situ , found them sound .</l>
     <l n="29">The girl had lived , was not a virgin , still</l>
     <l n="30">Had temperately indulged , and not at all</l>
     <l n="31">In recent months , no evidence at all</l>
     <l n="32">Of conjugation willingly or not ,</l>
     <l n="33">The day of death . But still I lifted out</l>
     <l n="34">The ovaries , fallopian tubes and uterus ,</l>
     <l n="35">The vagina and vulvae . Opened up</l>
     <l n="36">The mammals , found no milk . No pregnancy</l>
     <l n="37">Existed , sealed these organs up to test</l>
     <l n="38">For poison later , as we doctors know</l>
     <l n="39">Sometimes a poison 's introduced per vaginam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="40">I sealed the brain up too , shall make a test</l>
     <l n="41">Of blood and serum for urea ; death</l>
     <l n="42">Comes suddenly from that , you find no lesion ,</l>
     <l n="43">Must take a piece of brain and cut it up ,</l>
     <l n="44">Pour boiling water on it , break the brain</l>
     <l n="45">To finer pieces , pour the water off ,</l>
     <l n="46">Digest the piece of brain in other water ,</l>
     <l n="47">Repeat four times , the solutions mix together ,</l>
     <l n="48">Dry in an oven , treat with ether , at last</l>
     <l n="49">The residue put on a slide of glass</l>
     <l n="50">With nitric acid , let it stand awhile ,</l>
     <l n="51">Then take your microscope — if there 's urea</l>
     <l n="52">You 'll see the crystals — very beautiful !</l>

     <l n="55">Likewise I have sealed up</l>

     <l n="58">Appearance that convinces , opium ,</l>
     <l n="59">Hyoscyamus , belladonna fool us ;</l>
     <l n="60">But as the stomach had no inflammation ,</l>
     <l n="61">It was not chloral , ether took her off ,</l>

     <l n="63">Strychnia , if it killed her ; though you know</l>
     <l n="64">That case in England sixty years ago ,</l>
     <l n="65">Where the analysis did not disclose</l>

     <l n="71">I turn to streptococcus , deadly snake ,</l>
     <l n="72">Or shall I call him tiger ? For I think</l>
     <l n="73">The microscopic world of living things</l>

     <l n="77">Sweet words come from the lips and tender hands</l>

     <l n="79">The jungle has been roused in throat or lungs ;</l>

     <l n="84">There 's the heart ,</l>

     <l n="86">But if she had a syncope and fell</l>
     <l n="87">She must have bruised her body or her head .</l>

     <l n="92">And oftentimes the heart resumes its beat .</l>
     <l n="93">Perhaps she was held up until she died ,</l>
     <l n="94">Then laid there by the river , so no bruise .</l>
     <l n="95">So many theories come to me . But again ,</l>
     <l n="96">I say to you , look for a man . Run down</l>
     <l n="97">All clues of Gregory Wenner . He is dead —</l>
     <l n="98">Loss of a building drives to suicide —</l>
     <l n="99">The papers say , but still it may be true</l>
     <l n="100">He was with Elenor Murray when she died ,</l>
     <l n="101">Pushed her , we 'll say , or struck her in a way</l>
     <l n="102">To leave no mark , a tap upon the heart</l>
     <l n="103">That shocked the muscles more or less obscure</l>
     <l n="104">That bind the auricles and ventricles ,</l>
     <l n="105">And killed her . Then he flies away in fear ,</l>
     <l n="106">Aghast at what he does , and kills himself .</l>
     <l n="107">Look for a man , I say . It must be true ,</l>
     <l n="108">She went so secretly to walk that morning</l>

     <l n="110">So while you hunt the man , I 'll look for ricin ,</l>

     <l n="1">Elenor Murray landing in New York ,</l>
     <l n="2">After a weary voyage , none too well ,</l>
     <l n="3">Staid in the city for a week and then</l>
     <l n="4">Upon a telegram from Irma Leese ,</l>
     <l n="5">Born Irma Fouche , her aunt who lived alone</l>
     <l n="6">This summer in the Fouche house near LeRoy ,</l>
     <l n="7">Came west to visit Irma Leese and rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">For Elenor Murray had not been herself</l>
     <l n="9">Since that hard spring when in the hospital ,</l>
     <l n="10">Caring for soldiers stricken with the flu ,</l>
     <l n="11">She took bronchitis , after weeks in bed</l>
     <l n="12">Rose weak and shaky , crept to health again</l>
     <l n="13">Through egg-nogs , easy strolls about Bordeaux .</l>
     <l n="14">And later went to Nice upon a furlough</l>
     <l n="15">To get her strength again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">But while she saw</l>
     <l n="17">Her vital flame burn brightly , as of old</l>
     <l n="18">On favored days , yet for the rest the flame</l>
     <l n="19">Sputtered or sank a little . So she thought</l>
     <l n="20">How good it might be to go west and stroll</l>
     <l n="21">About the lovely country of LeRoy ,</l>
     <l n="22">And hear the whispering cedars by a window</l>
     <l n="23">In the Fouche mansion where this Irma Leese ,</l>
     <l n="24">Her aunt , was summering . So she telegraphed ,</l>
     <l n="25">And being welcomed , went .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">This stately house ,</l>
     <l n="27">Built sixty years before by Arthur Fouche ,</l>
     <l n="28">A brick home with a mansard roof , an oriel</l>
     <l n="29">That looked between the cedars , and a porch</l>
     <l n="30">With great Ionic columns , from the street</l>
     <l n="31">Stood distantly amid ten acres of lawn ,</l>
     <l n="32">Trees , flower plots — belonged to Irma Leese ,</l>
     <l n="33">Who had reclaimed it from a chiropractor ,</l>
     <l n="34">To cleanse the name of Fouche from that indignity ,</l>
     <l n="35">And bring it in the family again ,</l>
     <l n="36">Since she had spent her girlhood , womanhood</l>
     <l n="37">To twenty years amid its twenty rooms .</l>
     <l n="38">For Irma Leese at twenty years had married</l>
     <l n="39">And found herself at twenty-five a widow ,</l>
     <l n="40">With money left her , then had tried again ,</l>
     <l n="41">And after years dissolved the second pact ,</l>
     <l n="42">And made a settlement , was rich in fact ,</l>
     <l n="43">Now forty-two . Five years before had come</l>
     <l n="44">And found the house she loved a sanitarium ,</l>
     <l n="45">A chiropractor 's home . And as she stood</l>
     <l n="46">Beside the fence and saw the oriel ,</l>
     <l n="47">Remembered all her happiness on this lawn</l>
     <l n="48">With brothers and with sisters , one of whom</l>
     <l n="49">Was Elenor Murray 's mother , then she willed</l>
     <l n="50">To buy the place and spend some summers here .</l>
     <l n="51">And here she was the summer Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="52">Returned from France .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="53">And Irma Leese had said :</l>
     <l n="54">“ Here is your room , it has the oriel ,</l>
     <l n="55">And there 's the river and the hills for you .</l>
     <l n="56">Have breakfast in your room what hour you will ,</l>
     <l n="57">Rise when you will . We 'll drive and walk and rest ,</l>
     <l n="58">Run to Chicago when we have a mind .</l>
     <l n="59">I have a splendid chauffeur now and maids .</l>
     <l n="60">You must grow strong and well . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="61">And Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="62">Gasped out her happiness for the pretty room ,</l>
     <l n="63">And stood and viewed the river and the hills ,</l>
     <l n="64">And wept a little on the gentle shoulder</l>
     <l n="65">Of Irma Leese .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="66">And so the days had passed</l>
     <l n="67">Of walking , driving , resting , many talks ;</l>
     <l n="68">For Elenor Murray spoke to Irma Leese</l>
     <l n="69">Of tragic and of rapturous days in France ,</l>
     <l n="70">And Irma Leese , though she had lived full years ,</l>
     <l n="71">Had scarcely lived as much as Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="72">And could not hear enough from Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="73">Of the war and France , but mostly she would urge</l>
     <l n="74">Her niece to tell of what affairs of love</l>
     <l n="75">Had come to her . And Elenor Murray told</l>
     <l n="76">Of Gregory Wenner , save she did not tell</l>
     <l n="77">The final secret , with a gesture touched</l>
     <l n="78">The story off by saying : It was hopeless ,</l>
     <l n="79">I went into religion to forget .</l>
     <l n="80">But on a day she said to Irma Leese :</l>
     <l n="81">“ I almost met my fate at Nice , ” then sketched</l>
     <l n="82">A hurried picture of a brief romance .</l>
     <l n="83">But Elenor Murray told her nothing else</l>
     <l n="84">Of loves or men . But all the while the aunt</l>
     <l n="85">Weighed Elenor Murray , on a day exclaimed :</l>
     <l n="86">“ I see myself in you , and you are like</l>
     <l n="87">Your Aunt Corinne who died in ninety-two .</l>
     <l n="88">I 'll tell you all about your Aunt Corinne</l>
     <l n="89">Some day when we are talking , but I see</l>
     <l n="90">You have the Fouche blood — we are lovers all .</l>
     <l n="91">Your mother is a lover , Elenor ,</l>

     <l n="97">Had money and all that , but youth is all ,</l>

     <l n="100">A week or two had passed</l>
     <l n="101">Since Elenor Murray came to Irma Leese ,</l>
     <l n="102">When on a morning fire broke from the eaves</l>
     <l n="103">And menaced all the house ; but maids and gardeners</l>
     <l n="104">With buckets saved the house , while Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="105">And Irma Leese dipped water from the barrels</l>

     <l n="107">A week from that</l>
     <l n="108">A carpenter was working at the eaves</l>
     <l n="109">Along the ell , and in the garret knelt</l>
     <l n="110">To pry up boards and patch . When as he pried</l>
     <l n="111">A board up , he beheld between the rafters</l>
     <l n="112">A package of old letters stained and frayed ,</l>
     <l n="113">Tied with a little ribbon almost dust .</l>
     <l n="114">And when he went down-stairs , delivered it</l>
     <l n="115">To Irma Leese and said : Here are some letters</l>
     <l n="116">I found up in the garret under the floor ,</l>
     <l n="117">I pried up in my work .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="118">Then Irma Leese</l>

     <l n="121">And saw the story which she knew before</l>
     <l n="122">Brought back in this uncanny way , the hand</l>
     <l n="123">Which wrote the letters six and twenty years</l>
     <l n="124">Turned back to dust . And when her niece came in</l>
     <l n="125">She showed the letters , said , “ I 'll let you read ,</l>
     <l n="126">I 'll tell you all about them ":</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="127">“ When Corinne</l>
     <l n="128">Was nineteen , very beautiful and vital ,</l>
     <l n="129">Red-cheeked , a dancer , bubbling like new wine ,</l>
     <l n="130">A catch , as you may know , you see this house</l>
     <l n="131">Was full of laughter then , so many children .</l>
     <l n="132">We had our parties , too , and young men thought ,</l>
     <l n="133">Each one of us would have a dowry splendid —</l>
     <l n="134">A young man from Chicago came along ,</l>
     <l n="135">A lawyer there , but lately come from Pittsburgh</l>
     <l n="136">To practice , win his way . I knew this man .</l>
     <l n="137">He was a handsome dog with curly hair ,</l>
     <l n="138">Blue eyes and sturdy figure . Well , Corinne</l>
     <l n="139">Quite lost her heart . He came here to a dance ,</l>
     <l n="140">And so the game commenced . And father thought</l>
     <l n="141">The fellow was not right , but all of us ,</l>
     <l n="142">Your mother and myself said , yes he is ,</l>
     <l n="143">And we conspired to help Corinne and smooth</l>
     <l n="144">The path of confidence . But later on</l>
     <l n="145">Corinne was not so buoyant , would not talk</l>
     <l n="146">With me , your mother freely . Then at last</l>
     <l n="147">Her eyes were sometimes red ; we knew she wept .</l>
     <l n="148">And , then Corinne was sent away . Well , here</l>
     <l n="149">You 'll guess the rest . Her health was breaking down ,</l>
     <l n="150">That 's true enough ; the world could think its thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="151">And say his love grew cold , or she found out</l>
     <l n="152">The black-leg that he was , and he was that .</l>
     <l n="153">But Elenor , the truth was more than that ,</l>
     <l n="154">Corinne had been betrayed , she went away</l>
     <l n="155">To right herself — these letters prove the case ,</l>
     <l n="156">Which all the gossips , busy as they were ,</l>
     <l n="157">Could not make out . The paper at LeRoy</l>
     <l n="158">Had printed that she went to pay a visit</l>
     <l n="159">To relatives in the east . Three months or so</l>
     <l n="160">She came back well and rosy . But meanwhile</l>
     <l n="161">Your grandfather had paid this shabby scoundrel</l>
     <l n="162">A sum of money , I forget the sum ,</l>
     <l n="163">To get these letters of your Aunt Corinne —</l>
     <l n="164">These letters here . This matter leaked , of course .</l>
     <l n="165">And then we let the story take this form</l>
     <l n="166">And moulded it a little to this form :</l>
     <l n="167">The fellow was a scoundrel — this was proved</l>
     <l n="168">When he took money to return her letters .</l>
     <l n="169">They were love letters , they had been engaged ,</l>
     <l n="170">She thought him worthy , found herself deceived</l>
     <l n="171">Proved , too , by taking money , when at first</l>
     <l n="172">He looked with honorable eyes to young Corinne ,</l>
     <l n="173">And won her trust . And so Corinne lived here</l>
     <l n="174">Ten years or more , at thirty married the judge ,</l>
     <l n="175">Her senior thirty years , and went away .</l>
     <l n="176">She bore a child and died — look Elenor</l>
     <l n="177">Here are the letters which she took and nailed</l>
     <l n="178">Beneath the garret floor . We 'll read them through ,</l>

     <l n="180">Irma Leese rose up</l>

    <head>MIRIAM FAY 'S LETTER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Elenor Murray asked to go in training</l>
     <l n="2">And came to see me , but the school was full ,</l>
     <l n="3">We could not take her . Then she asked to stand</l>
     <l n="4">Upon a list and wait , I put her off .</l>
     <l n="5">She came back , and she came back , till at last</l>
     <l n="6">I took her application ; then she came</l>
     <l n="7">And pushed herself and asked when she could come ,</l>
     <l n="8">And start to train . At last I laughed and said :</l>
     <l n="9">“ Well , come to-morrow . ” I had never seen</l>
     <l n="10">Such eagerness , persistence . So she came .</l>
     <l n="11">She tried to make a friend of me , perhaps</l>
     <l n="12">Since it was best , I being in command .</l>
     <l n="13">But anyway she wooed me , tried to please me .</l>
     <l n="14">And spite of everything I grew to love her ,</l>
     <l n="15">Though I distrusted her . But yet again</l>
     <l n="16">I had belief in her best self , though doubting</l>
     <l n="17">The girl somehow . But when I learned the girl</l>
     <l n="18">Had never had religious discipline ,</l>
     <l n="19">Her father without faith , her mother too ,</l>
     <l n="20">Her want of moral sense , I understood .</l>
     <l n="21">She lacked stability of spirit , to-day</l>
     <l n="22">She would be one thing , something else the next .</l>
     <l n="23">Shot up in fire , which failed and died away</l>
     <l n="24">And I began to see her fraternize</l>
     <l n="25">With girls who had her traits , too full of life</l>
     <l n="26">To be what they should be , unstable too ,</l>
     <l n="27">Much like herself .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="28">Not long before she came</l>
     <l n="29">Into the training school , six months , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="30">She had some tragedy , I do n't know what ,</l>
     <l n="31">Had been quite ill in body and in mind .</l>
     <l n="32">When she went into training I could see</l>
     <l n="33">Her purpose to wear down herself , forget</l>
     <l n="34">In weariness of body , something lived .</l>
     <l n="35">She was alert and dutiful and sunny ,</l>
     <l n="36">Kept all the rules , was studious , led the class ,</l>
     <l n="37">Excelled , I think , in studies of the nerves ,</l>
     <l n="38">The mind grown sick .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">As we grew better friends ,</l>
     <l n="40">More intimate , she talked about religion ,</l>
     <l n="41">And sacred subjects , asked about the church .</l>
     <l n="42">I gave her books to read , encouraged her ,</l>
     <l n="43">Asked her to make her peace with God , and set</l>
     <l n="44">Her feet in pious paths . At last she said</l>
     <l n="45">She wished to be baptized , confirmed . I made</l>
     <l n="46">The plans for her , she was baptized , confirmed ,</l>
     <l n="47">Went to confessional , and seemed renewed</l>
     <l n="48">In spirit by conversion . For at once</l>
     <l n="49">Her zeal was like a flame at Pentecost ,</l>
     <l n="50">She almost took the veil , but missing that ,</l>
     <l n="51">She followed out the discipline to the letter ,</l>
     <l n="52">Kept all the feast days , went to mass , communion ,</l>
     <l n="53">Did works of charity ; indeed , I think</l>
     <l n="54">She spent her spare hours all in all at sewing</l>
     <l n="55">There with the sisters for the poor . She had ,</l>
     <l n="56">When she came to me , jewelry of value ,</l>
     <l n="57">A diamond solitaire , some other things .</l>
     <l n="58">I missed them , and she said she sold them , gave</l>
     <l n="59">The money to a home for friendless children .</l>
     <l n="60">And I remember when she said her father</l>
     <l n="61">Had wronged , misvalued her ; but now her love ,</l>
     <l n="62">Made more abundant by the love of Christ ,</l>
     <l n="63">Had brought her to forgiveness . All her mood</l>
     <l n="64">Was of humility and sacrifice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="65">One time I saw her at the convent , sitting</l>
     <l n="66">Upon a foot-stool at the gracious feet</l>
     <l n="67">Of the Mother Superior , sewing for the poor ;</l>
     <l n="68">Hair parted in the middle , curls combed out .</l>
     <l n="69">Then was it that I missed her jewelry .</l>
     <l n="70">She looked just like a poor maid , humble , patient ,</l>
     <l n="71">Head bent above her sewing , eyes averted .</l>
     <l n="72">The room was silent with religious thought .</l>
     <l n="73">I loved her then and pitied her . But now</l>
     <l n="74">I think she had that in her which at times</l>
     <l n="75">Made her a flagellant , at other times</l>
     <l n="76">A rioter . She used the church to drag</l>
     <l n="77">Her life from something , took it for a bladder</l>
     <l n="78">To float her soul when it was perilled . First ,</l>
     <l n="79">She did not sell her jewelry ; this ring ,</l>
     <l n="80">Too brilliant for forgetting , or to pass</l>
     <l n="81">Unnoticed when she wore it , showed again</l>
     <l n="82">Upon her finger after she had come</l>
     <l n="83">Out of her training , was a graduate .</l>
     <l n="84">She had a faculty for getting in</l>
     <l n="85">Where elegance and riches were . She went</l>
     <l n="86">Among the great ones , when she found a way ,</l>
     <l n="87">And traveled with them where she learned the life</l>
     <l n="88">Of notables , aristocrats . It was there ,</l>
     <l n="89">Or when from duty free and feasting , gadding</l>
     <l n="90">The ring showed on her finger .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="91">In two years</l>
     <l n="92">She dropped the church . New friends made in the school ,</l>
     <l n="93">New interests , work that took her energies</l>
     <l n="94">And this religious flare had cured her up</l>
     <l n="95">Of what was killing her when first I knew her .</l>
     <l n="96">There was another thing that drew her back</l>
     <l n="97">To flesh , away from spirit : She saw bodies ,</l>
     <l n="98">And handled bodies as a nurse , forgot</l>
     <l n="99">The body is the spirit 's temple , fell</l>
     <l n="100">To some materialism of thought . And now</l>
     <l n="101">Avoided me , was much away , of course ,</l>
     <l n="102">On duty here and there . I tried to hold her ,</l>
     <l n="103">Protect and guide her , wrote to her at times</l>
     <l n="104">To make confession , take communion . She</l>
     <l n="105">Ignored these letters . But I heard her say</l>
     <l n="106">The body was as natural as the soul ,</l>
     <l n="107">And just as natural its desires . She kept</l>
     <l n="108">Out of the wreck of faith one thing alone ,</l>
     <l n="109">If she kept that : She could endure to hear</l>
     <l n="110">God 's name profaned , but would not stand to hear</l>
     <l n="111">The Savior 's spoken in irreverence .</l>
     <l n="112">She was afraid , no doubt . Or to be just ,</l>
     <l n="113">The tender love of Christ , his sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="114">Perhaps had won her wholly — let it go ,</l>
     <l n="115">I 'll say that much for her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="116">Why am I harsh ?</l>
     <l n="117">Because I saw the good in her all streaked</l>
     <l n="118">With so much evil , evil known and lived</l>
     <l n="119">In knowledge of it , clung to none the less ,</l>
     <l n="120">Unstable as water , how could she succeed ?</l>
     <l n="121">Untruthful , how could confidence be hers ?</l>
     <l n="122">I sometimes think she joined the church to mask</l>
     <l n="123">A secret life , renewed forgiven sins .</l>
     <l n="124">After she cloaked herself with piety .</l>
     <l n="125">Perhaps , at least , when she saw what to do ,</l>
     <l n="126">And how to do it , using these detours</l>
     <l n="127">Of piety to throw us off , who else</l>
     <l n="128">Had seen what doors she entered , whence she came .</l>
     <l n="129">She wronged the church , I think , made it a screen</l>
     <l n="130">To stand behind for kisses , to look from</l>
     <l n="131">Inviting kisses . Then , as I have said ,</l>
     <l n="132">She took materialism from her work ,</l>
     <l n="133">And so renewed her sins . She drank , I think ,</l>
     <l n="134">And smoked and feasted ; but as for the rest ,</l>
     <l n="135">The smoke obscured the flame , but there is flame</l>
     <l n="136">Or fire at least where there is smoke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="137">You ask</l>
     <l n="138">What took her to the war ? Why only this :</l>
     <l n="139">Adventure , chance of marriage , amorous conquests —</l>
     <l n="140">The girl was mad for men , although I saw</l>
     <l n="141">Her smoke obscured the flame , I never saw her</l>
     <l n="142">Except with robins far too tame or lame</l>
     <l n="143">To interest her , and robins prove to me</l>
     <l n="144">The hawk is somewhere , waits for night to join</l>
     <l n="145">His playmate when the robins are at rest .</l>
     <l n="146">You see the girl has madness in her , flies</l>
     <l n="147">From exaltation up to ecstasy .</l>
     <l n="148">Feeds on emotion , never has enough .</l>
     <l n="149">Tries all things , states of spirit , even beliefs .</l>
     <l n="150">Passes from lust ( I think ) to celibacy ,</l>
     <l n="151">Feasts , fasts , eats , starves , has raptures then inflicts</l>
     <l n="152">The whip upon her back , is penitent ,</l>
     <l n="153">Then proud , is humble , then is arrogant ,</l>
     <l n="154">Looks down demurely , stares you out of face ,</l>
     <l n="155">But runs the world around . For in point of fact ,</l>
     <l n="156">She traveled much , knew cities and their ways ;</l>
     <l n="157">And when I used to see her at the convent</l>
     <l n="158">So meek , clothed like a sewing maid , at once</l>
     <l n="159">The pictures that she showed me of herself</l>
     <l n="160">At seaside places or on boulevards ,</l>
     <l n="161">Her beauty clothed in linen or in silk ,</l>
     <l n="162">Came back to mind , and I would resurrect</l>
     <l n="163">The fragments of our talks in which I saw</l>
     <l n="164">How she knew foods and drinks and restaurants ,</l>
     <l n="165">And fashionable shops . This girl could fool the elect —</l>
     <l n="166">She fooled me for a time . I found her out .</l>
     <l n="167">Did she aspire ? Perhaps , if you believe</l>
     <l n="168">It 's aspiration to seek out the rich ,</l>
     <l n="169">And ape them . Not for me . Of course she went</l>
     <l n="170">To get adventure in the war , perhaps</l>
     <l n="171">She got too much . But as to waste of life ,</l>
     <l n="172">She might have been a quiet , noble woman</l>
     <l n="173">Keeping her place in life , not trying to rise</l>
     <l n="174">Out of her class — too useless — in her class</l>
     <l n="175">Making herself all worthy , serviceable .</l>
     <l n="176">You 'll find ‘ twas pride that slew her . Very like</l>
     <l n="177">She found a rich man , tried to hold him , lost</l>
     <l n="178">Her honor and her life in consequence .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="179">When Merival showed this letter to the jury ,</l>
     <l n="180">Marion the juryman spoke up :</l>
     <l n="181">“ You know that type of woman — saintly hag !</l>
     <l n="182">I would n't take her word about a thing</l>
     <l n="183">By way of inference , or analysis .</l>
     <l n="184">They had some trouble , she and Elenor</l>
     <l n="185">You may be sure . ” And Merival replied :</l>
     <l n="186">“ Take it for what it 's worth . I leave you now</l>
     <l n="187">To see the man who owns the Daily Times .</l>
     <l n="188">He 's turned upon our inquest , did you see</l>
     <l n="189">The jab he gives me ? I can jab as well . ”</l>
     <l n="190">So Merival went out and took with him</l>
     <l n="191">A riffle in the waters of circumstance</l>
     <l n="192">Set up by Elenor Murray 's death to one</l>

     <l n="1">Archibald Lowell , owner of the Times</l>
     <l n="2">Lived six months of the year at Sunnyside ,</l>
     <l n="3">His Gothic castle near LeRoy , so named</l>
     <l n="4">Because no sun was in him , it may be .</l>
     <l n="5">His wife was much away when on this earth</l>
     <l n="6">At cures , in travel , fighting psychic ills ,</l>
     <l n="7">Approaching madness , dying nerves . They said</l>
     <l n="8">Her heart was starved for living with a man</l>
     <l n="9">So cold and silent . Thirty years she lived</l>
     <l n="10">Bound to this man , in restless agony ,</l>
     <l n="11">And as she could not free her life from his ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor keep it living with him , on a day</l>
     <l n="13">She stuck a gas hose in her mouth and drank</l>
     <l n="14">Her lungs full of the lethal stuff and died .</l>
     <l n="15">That was the very day the hunter found</l>
     <l n="16">Elenor Murray 's body near the river .</l>
     <l n="17">A servant saw this Mrs. Lowell lying</l>
     <l n="18">A copy of the Times clutched in her hand ,</l>
     <l n="19">Which published that a slip of paper found</l>
     <l n="20">In Elenor Murray 's pocket had these words</l>
     <l n="21">“ To be brave and not to flinch . ” And was she brave ,</l>
     <l n="22">And nerved to end it by these words of Elenor ?</l>
     <l n="23">But Archibald , the husband , could not bear</l>
     <l n="24">To have the death by suicide made known .</l>
     <l n="25">He laid the body out , as if his wife</l>
     <l n="26">Had gone to bed as usual , turned a jet</l>
     <l n="27">And left it , just as if his wife had failed</l>
     <l n="28">To fully turn it , then went in the room ;</l>
     <l n="29">Then called the servants , did not know that one</l>
     <l n="30">Had seen her with the Times clutched in her hand .</l>
     <l n="31">He thought the matter hidden . Merival ,</l>
     <l n="32">All occupied with Elenor Murray 's death</l>
     <l n="33">Gave to a deputy the Lowell inquest .</l>
     <l n="34">But later what this servant saw was told</l>
     <l n="35">To Merival .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="36">And now no more alone</l>
     <l n="37">Than when his wife lived , Lowell passed the days</l>
     <l n="38">At Sunnyside , as he had done for years .</l>
     <l n="39">He sat alone , and paced the rooms alone ,</l>
     <l n="40">With hands behind him clasped , in fear and wonder</l>
     <l n="41">Of life and what life is . He rode about ,</l>
     <l n="42">And viewed his blooded cattle on the hills .</l>
     <l n="43">But what were all these rooms and acres to him</l>
     <l n="44">With no face near him but the servants , gardeners ?</l>
     <l n="45">Sometimes he wished he had a child to draw</l>
     <l n="46">Upon his fabulous income , growing more</l>
     <l n="47">Since all his life was centered in the Times</l>
     <l n="48">To swell its revenues , and in the process</l>
     <l n="49">His spirit was more fully in the Times</l>
     <l n="50">Than in his body . There were eyes who saw</l>
     <l n="51">How deftly was his spirit woven in it</l>
     <l n="52">Until it was a scarf to bind and choke</l>
     <l n="53">The public throat , or stifle honest thought</l>
     <l n="54">Like a soft pillow offered for the head ,</l>
     <l n="55">But used to smother . There were eyes who saw</l>

     <l n="59">To learn the public 's thought . Its cautious pauses ,</l>
     <l n="60">With foot uplifted , ears pricked up to hear</l>
     <l n="61">A step fall , twig break . Platitudes in progress —</l>

     <l n="66">With such exactness in the communal life ?</l>
     <l n="67">Some thousands thought it fair — what should they think</l>
     <l n="68">When it played neutral in the matter of news</l>
     <l n="69">To both sides of the question , though at last</l>

     <l n="71">Determined from the first , a secret plan ,</l>

     <l n="73">Some thousands liked the kind of news it printed</l>
     <l n="74">Where no sensation flourished — smallest type</l>
     <l n="75">That fixed attention for the staring eyes</l>
     <l n="76">Needed for type so small . But others knew</l>
     <l n="77">It led the people by its fair pretensions ,</l>

     <l n="79">This editor played hand-ball in this way :</l>
     <l n="80">The advertisers tossed the ball , the readers</l>
     <l n="81">Caught it and tossed it to the advertisers :</l>
     <l n="82">And as the readers multiplied , the columns</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="86">It was an ingrown mind ,</l>

     <l n="88">Of crowds and streets , uncomfortable in clubs ,</l>
     <l n="89">No warmth in hands to touch his fellows ’ hands ,</l>
     <l n="90">Keeping aloof from politicians , loathing</l>
     <l n="91">The human alderman who bails the thief ;</l>
     <l n="92">The little scamp who pares a little profit ,</l>

     <l n="96">This Lowell hid himself from favor seekers ,</l>
     <l n="97">Such letters filtered to him through a sieve</l>
     <l n="98">Of secretaries . If he had a friend ,</l>

     <l n="105">Such letters , editorials as he spoke .</l>
     <l n="106">His life was nearly waste . A peanut stand</l>

     <l n="121">A desiccated soul , so dry the moss</l>

     <l n="126">His fears of sudden death , pains in the chest ,</l>
     <l n="127">His manager had come — was made to wait</l>
     <l n="128">Until the doctor finished — brought the sheets</l>
     <l n="129">Which showed the advertising , circulation .</l>
     <l n="130">And Lowell studied them and said at last :</l>

     <l n="132">A thing of interest , does the public like it ? ”</l>
     <l n="133">To which the manager : “ It sells the paper . ”</l>

     <l n="143">Next day the Times</l>
     <l n="144">Rebuked the coroner in these words . And then</l>
     <l n="145">Merival sent word : “ I come to see you ,</l>
     <l n="146">Or else you come to see me , or by process</l>
     <l n="147">If you refuse . ” And so the editor</l>
     <l n="148">Invited Merival to Sunnyside</l>
     <l n="149">To talk the matter out . This was the talk :</l>
     <l n="150">First Merival went over all the ground</l>
     <l n="151">In mild locution , what he sought to do .</l>
     <l n="152">How as departments in the war had studied</l>
     <l n="153">Disease and what not , tabulated facts ,</l>
     <l n="154">He wished to make a start for knowing lives ,</l>
     <l n="155">And finding remedies for lives . It 's true</l>
     <l n="156">Not much might be accomplished , also true</l>
     <l n="157">The poet and the novelist gave thought ,</l>
     <l n="158">Analysis to lives , yet who could tell</l>
     <l n="159">What system might grow up to find the fault</l>
     <l n="160">In marriage as it is , in rearing children</l>
     <l n="161">In motherhood , in homes ; for Merival</l>
     <l n="162">By way of wit said to this dullest man :</l>
     <l n="163">“ I know of mother and of home , of heaven</l>
     <l n="164">I 've yet to learn . ” Whereat the great man winced ,</l>
     <l n="165">To hear the home and motherhood so slurred ,</l>
     <l n="166">And briefly said the Times would go its way</l>
     <l n="167">To serve the public interests , and to foster</l>
     <l n="168">American ideals as he conceived them .</l>
     <l n="169">Then Merival who knew the great man 's nature ,</l>
     <l n="170">How small it was and barren , cold and dull ,</l>
     <l n="171">And wedded to small things , to gold , and fear</l>
     <l n="172">Of change , and knew the life the woman lived ,—</l>
     <l n="173">These seven days in the earth — with such a man ,</l>
     <l n="174">Just by a zephyr of intangible thought</l>
     <l n="175">Veered round the talk to her , to voice a wonder</l>
     <l n="176">About the jet left turned , his deputy</l>
     <l n="177">Had overlooked a hose which she could drink</l>
     <l n="178">Gas from a jet . “ You need n't touch the jet .</l>
     <l n="179">Just leave it as she left it — hide the hose ,</l>
     <l n="180">And leave the gas on , put the woman in bed . ”</l>
     <l n="181">“ This deputy , ” said Merival , “ was slack</l>
     <l n="182">And let a verdict pass of accident . ”</l>
     <l n="183">“ Oh yes ” said Merival , “ your servant told</l>
     <l n="184">About the hose , the Times clutched in her hand .</l>
     <l n="185">And may I test this jet , while I am here ?</l>
     <l n="186">Go up to see and test it ? ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="187">Whereupon</l>
     <l n="188">The great man with wide eyes stared in the eyes</l>
     <l n="189">Of Merival , was speechless for a moment ,</l>
     <l n="190">Not knowing what to say , while Merival</l>
     <l n="191">Read something in his eyes , saw in his eyes</l>
     <l n="192">The secret beat to cover , saw the man</l>
     <l n="193">Turn head away which shook a little , saw</l>
     <l n="194">His chest expand for breath , and heard at last</l>
     <l n="195">The editor in four steel bullet words ,</l>
     <l n="196">“ It is not necessary . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="197">Merival</l>
     <l n="198">Had trapped the solitary fox — arose</l>

     <l n="200">The inquest must be changed . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="201">The editor</l>
     <l n="202">Looked through the window at the coroner</l>
     <l n="203">Walking the gravel walk , and saw his hand</l>
     <l n="204">Unlatch the iron gate , and saw him pass</l>
     <l n="205">From view behind the trees .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="206">Then horror rose</l>
     <l n="207">Within his brain , a nameless horror took</l>
     <l n="208">The heart of him , for fear this coroner</l>
     <l n="209">Would dig this secret up , and show the world</l>
     <l n="210">The dead face of the woman self-destroyed ,</l>
     <l n="211">And of the talk , which would not come to him ,</l>

     <l n="213">This woman took her life ; if for ill health</l>
     <l n="214">Then why ill health ? O , well he knew at heart</l>
     <l n="215">What he had done to break her , starve her life .</l>
     <l n="216">And now accused himself too much for words ,</l>
     <l n="217">Ways , temperament of him that murdered her ,</l>
     <l n="218">For lovelessness , and for deliberate hands</l>

     <l n="220">He rode that day</l>
     <l n="221">To see his cattle , overlook the work ,</l>
     <l n="222">But when night came with silence and the cry</l>
     <l n="223">Of night-hawks , and the elegy of leaves</l>
     <l n="224">Beneath the stars that looked so cold at him</l>
     <l n="225">As he turned seeking sleep , the dreaded pain</l>
     <l n="226">Grew stronger in his breast . Dawn came at last</l>
     <l n="227">And then the stir and voices of the maids .</l>
     <l n="228">And after breakfast in the carven room</l>
     <l n="229">Archibald Lowell standing by the mantel</l>
     <l n="230">In his great library , felt sudden pain ;</l>
     <l n="231">Saw sudden darkness , nothing saw at once ,</l>
     <l n="232">Lying upon the marble of the hearth ;</l>
     <l n="233">His great head cut which struck the post of brass</l>
     <l n="234">In the hearth 's railing — only a little blood !</l>
     <l n="235">Archibald Lowell being dead at last ;</l>
     <l n="236">The Times left to the holders of the stock</l>
     <l n="237">Who kept his policy , and kept the Times</l>
     <l n="238">As if the great man lived .</l>

     <l n="239">And Merival</l>

     <l n="241">By angina pectoris , let it drop .</l>

     <l n="246">From alien neighborhoods of life and kill .</l>
     <l n="247">And Lowell leaves a will , to which a boy —</l>

     <l n="249">Is alien as this Elenor to the man</l>
     <l n="250">Who owned the Times . But still is brought in touch</l>
     <l n="251">With Lowell 's will , because this Lowell died</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Marie Fortelka , widow , mother of Josef ,</l>
     <l n="2">Now seventeen , an invalid at home</l>
     <l n="3">In a house , in Halstead Street , his running side</l>
     <l n="4">Aching with broken ribs , read in the Times</l>
     <l n="5">Of Lowell 's death the editor , dressed herself</l>
     <l n="6">To call on William Rummler , legal mind</l>
     <l n="7">For Lowell and the Times .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">It was a day</l>
     <l n="9">When fog hung over the city , and she thought</l>
     <l n="10">Of fogs in Germany whence she came , and thought</l>
     <l n="11">Of hard conditions there when she was young .</l>
     <l n="12">Then as her boy , this Josef , coughed , she looked</l>
     <l n="13">And felt a pang at heart , a rise of wrath ,</l>
     <l n="14">And heard him moan for broken ribs and lungs</l>
     <l n="15">That had been bruised or mashed . America ,</l>
     <l n="16">Oh yes , America , she said to self ,</l>
     <l n="17">How is it different from the land I left ?</l>
     <l n="18">And then her husband 's memory came to mind :</l>
     <l n="19">How he had fled his country to be free ,</l>
     <l n="20">And come to Philadelphia , with the thrill</l>
     <l n="21">Of new life found , looked at the famous Hall</l>
     <l n="22">Which gave the Declaration , cried and laughed</l>
     <l n="23">And said : “ The country 's free , and I am here ,</l>
     <l n="24">I am free now , a man , no more a slave . ”</l>
     <l n="25">What did he find ? A job , but prices high .</l>
     <l n="26">Wages decreased in winter , then a strike .</l>
     <l n="27">He joined the union , found himself in jail</l>
     <l n="28">For passing hand-bills which announced the strike ,</l>
     <l n="29">And asked the public to take note , and punish</l>
     <l n="30">The corporation , not to trade with it ,</l>
     <l n="31">For its injustice toward the laborers .</l>
     <l n="32">And in the court he heard the judge decide :</l>
     <l n="33">“ Free speech cannot be used to gain the ends</l>
     <l n="34">Of ruin by conspiracy like this</l>
     <l n="35">Against a business . Men from foreign lands ,</l>
     <l n="36">Of despot rule and poverty , who come</l>
     <l n="37">For liberty and means of life among us</l>
     <l n="38">Must learn that liberty is ordered liberty ,</l>
     <l n="39">And is not license , freedom to commit</l>
     <l n="40">Injury to another . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="41">So in jail</l>
     <l n="42">He lay his thirty days out , went to work</l>
     <l n="43">Where he could find it , found the union smashed ,</l>
     <l n="44">Himself compelled to take what job he could ,</l>
     <l n="45">What wages he was offered . And his children</l>
     <l n="46">Kept coming year by year till there were eight ,</l>
     <l n="47">And Josef was but ten . And then he died</l>
     <l n="48">And left this helpless family , and the boy</l>
     <l n="49">Sold papers on the street , ten years of age ,</l>
     <l n="50">The widow washed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="51">And first he sold the Times</l>
     <l n="52">And helped to spread the doctrines of the Times</l>
     <l n="53">Of ordered liberty and epicene</l>
     <l n="54">Reforms of this or that . But when the Star</l>
     <l n="55">With millions back of it broke in the field</l>
     <l n="56">He changed and sold the Star , too bad for him —</l>
     <l n="57">Discovered something :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="58">Josef did not know</l>
     <l n="59">The corners of the street are free to all ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or free to none , where newsboys stood and sold ,</l>
     <l n="61">And kept their stands , or rather where the powers</l>
     <l n="62">That kept the great conspiracy of the press</l>
     <l n="63">Controlled the stands , and to prevent the Star</l>
     <l n="64">From gaining foot-hold . Not upon this corner</l>
     <l n="65">Nor on that corner , any corner in short</l>
     <l n="66">Shall newsboys sell the Star . But Josef felt ,</l>
     <l n="67">Being a boy , indifferent to the rules ,</l>
     <l n="68">Well founded , true or false , that all the corners</l>
     <l n="69">Were free to all , and for his daring , strength</l>
     <l n="70">Had been selected , picked to sell the Star ,</l>
     <l n="71">And break the ground , gain place upon the stands .</l>
     <l n="72">He had been warned from corners , chased and boxed</l>
     <l n="73">By heavy fists from corners more than once</l>
     <l n="74">Before the day they felled him . On that day</l>
     <l n="75">A monster bully , once a pugilist ,</l>
     <l n="76">Came on him selling the Star and knocked him down ,</l>
     <l n="77">Kicked in his ribs and broke a leg and cracked</l>
     <l n="78">His little skull .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="79">And so they took him home</l>
     <l n="80">To Widow Fortelka and the sisters , brothers ,</l>
     <l n="81">Whose bread he earned . And there he lay and moaned ,</l>
     <l n="82">And when he sat up had a little cough ,</l>
     <l n="83">Was short of breath .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="84">And on this foggy day</l>
     <l n="85">When Widow Fortelka reads in the Times</l>
     <l n="86">That Lowell , the editor , is dead , he sits</l>
     <l n="87">With feet wrapped in a quilt and gets his breath</l>
     <l n="88">With open mouth , his face is brightly flushed ;</l>
     <l n="89">A fetid sweetness fills the air of the room</l>
     <l n="90">That from his open mouth comes . Josef lingers</l>
     <l n="91">A few weeks yet — he has tuberculosis .</l>
     <l n="92">And so his mother looks at him , resolves</l>
     <l n="93">To call this day on William Rummler , see</l>
     <l n="94">If Lowell 's death has changed the state of things ;</l>
     <l n="95">And if the legal mind will not relent</l>
     <l n="96">Now that the mind that fed it lies in death .</l>
     <l n="97">It 's true enough , she thinks , I was dismissed ,</l>
     <l n="98">And sent away for good , but never mind .</l>
     <l n="99">It can n't be true this pugilist went farther</l>
     <l n="100">Than the authority of his hiring , that 's</l>
     <l n="101">The talk this lawyer gave her , used a word</l>
     <l n="102">She could not keep in mind — the lawyer said</l>
     <l n="103">Respondeat superior in this case</l>
     <l n="104">Was not in point — and if it could be proved</l>
     <l n="105">This pugilist was hired by the Times ,</l>
     <l n="106">No one could prove the Times had hired him</l>
     <l n="107">To beat a boy , commit a crime . Well , then</l>
     <l n="108">“ What was he hired for ? ” the widow asked .</l>
     <l n="109">And then she talked with newsboys , and they said</l>
     <l n="110">The papers had their sluggers , all of them ,</l>
     <l n="111">Even the Star , and that was just a move</l>
     <l n="112">In getting circulation , keeping it .</l>
     <l n="113">And all these sluggers watched the stands and drove</l>
     <l n="114">The newsboys selling Stars away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="115">No matter ,</l>
     <l n="116">She could not argue with this lawyer Rummler ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who said : “ You must excuse me , go away ,</l>
     <l n="118">I 'm sorry , but there 's nothing I can do . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="119">Now Widow Fortelka had never heard</l>
     <l n="120">Of Elenor Murray , had not read a line</l>
     <l n="121">Of Elenor Murray 's death beside the river .</l>
     <l n="122">She was as ignorant of the interview</l>
     <l n="123">Between the coroner and this editor</l>
     <l n="124">Who died next morning fearing Merival</l>
     <l n="125">Would dig up Mrs. Lowell and expose</l>
     <l n="126">Her suicide , as conferences of spirits</l>
     <l n="127">Directing matters in another world .</l>
     <l n="128">Her thought was moulded no less by the riffles</l>
     <l n="129">That spread from Elenor Murray and her death .</l>
     <l n="130">And she resolved to see this lawyer Rummler ,</l>
     <l n="131">And try again to get a settlement</l>
     <l n="132">To help her dying boy . And so she went .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="133">That morning Rummler coming into town</l>
     <l n="134">Had met a cynic friend upon the train</l>
     <l n="135">Who used his tongue as freely as his mood</l>
     <l n="136">Moved him to use it . So he said to Rummler :</l>
     <l n="137">“ I see your client died — a hell of a life</l>
     <l n="138">That fellow lived , a critic in our midst</l>
     <l n="139">Both hated and caressed . And I suppose</l>
     <l n="140">You drew his will and know it , I will bet ,</l>
     <l n="141">If he left anything to charity ,</l>
     <l n="142">Or to the city , it is some narcotic</l>
     <l n="143">To keep things as they are , the ailing body</l>
     <l n="144">To dull and bring forgetfulness of pain .</l>
     <l n="145">He was a fine albino of the soul ,</l>
     <l n="146">No pigment in his genesis to give</l>
     <l n="147">Color to hair or eyes , he had no gonads . ”</l>
     <l n="148">And William Rummler laughed and said , “ You 'll see</l>
     <l n="149">What Lowell did when I probate the will . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="150">Then William Rummler thought that very moment</l>
     <l n="151">Of plans whereby his legal mind could thrive</l>
     <l n="152">Upon the building of the big hotel</l>
     <l n="153">To Lowell 's memory , for perpetual use</l>
     <l n="154">Of the Y. M. C. A ., the seminary , too ,</l>
     <l n="155">In Moody 's memory for an orthodox</l>
     <l n="156">Instruction in the bible .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="157">With such things</l>
     <l n="158">In mind , this William Rummler opened the door ,</l>
     <l n="159">And stepped into his office , got a shock</l>
     <l n="160">From seeing Widow Fortelka on the bench ,</l>
     <l n="161">Where clients waited , waiting there for him .</l>
     <l n="162">She rose and greeted him , and William Rummler</l>
     <l n="163">Who in a stronger moment might have said :</l>
     <l n="164">“ You must excuse me , I have told you , madam ,</l>
     <l n="165">I can do nothing for you , ” let her follow</l>
     <l n="166">Into his private office and sit down</l>
     <l n="167">And there renew her suit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="168">She said to him :</l>
     <l n="169">“ My boy is dying now , I think his ribs</l>
     <l n="170">Were driven in his lungs and punctured them .</l>
     <l n="171">He coughs the worst stuff up you ever saw .</l>
     <l n="172">And has an awful fever , sweats his clothes</l>
     <l n="173">Right through , is breathless , cannot live a month .</l>
     <l n="174">And I know you can help me . Mr. Lowell ,</l>
     <l n="175">So you told me , refused a settlement ,</l>
     <l n="176">Because this pugilist was never hired</l>
     <l n="177">To beat my boy , or any boy ; for fear</l>
     <l n="178">It would be an admission , and be talked of ,</l>
     <l n="179">And lead another to demand some money .</l>
     <l n="180">But now he 's dead , and surely you are free</l>
     <l n="181">To help me some , so that this month or two ,</l>
     <l n="182">While my boy Joe is dying he can have</l>
     <l n="183">What milk he wants and food , and when he dies ,</l>
     <l n="184">A decent coffin , burial . Then perhaps</l>
     <l n="185">There will be something left to help me with —</l>
     <l n="186">I wash to feed the children , as you know . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="187">And William Rummler looked at her and thought</l>
     <l n="188">For one brief moment with his lawyer mind</l>
     <l n="189">About this horror , while the widow wept ,</l>
     <l n="190">And as she wept a culprit mood was his</l>
     <l n="191">For thinking of the truth , for well he knew</l>
     <l n="192">This slugger had been hired for such deeds ,</l>
     <l n="193">And here was one result . And in his pain</l>
     <l n="194">The cynic words his friend had said to him</l>
     <l n="195">Upon the train began to stir , and then</l>
     <l n="196">He felt a rush of feeling , blood , and thought</l>
     <l n="197">Of clause thirteen in Lowell 's will , which gave</l>
     <l n="198">The trustees power , and he was chief trustee ,</l>
     <l n="199">To give some worthy charity once a year ,</l>
     <l n="200">Not to exceed a thousand dollars . So</l>
     <l n="201">He thought to self , “ This is a charity .</l>
     <l n="202">I will advance the money , get it back</l>
     <l n="203">As soon as I probate the will . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="204">At last</l>
     <l n="205">He broke this moment 's musing and spoke up :</l>
     <l n="206">“ Your case appeals to me . You may step out ,</l>
     <l n="207">And wait till I prepare the papers , then</l>
     <l n="208">I 'll have a check made for a thousand dollars . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="209">Widow Fortelka rose up and took</l>
     <l n="210">The crucifix she wore and kissed it , wept</l>
     <l n="211">And left the room .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="212">Now here 's the case of Percy Ferguson</l>

    <head>REV . PERCY FERGUSON</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Rev . Percy Ferguson , patrician</l>
     <l n="2">Vicar of Christ , companion of the strong ,</l>
     <l n="3">And member of the inner shrine , where men</l>
     <l n="4">Observe the rituals of the golden calf ;</l>
     <l n="5">A dilettante , and writer for the press</l>
     <l n="6">Upon such themes as optimism , order ,</l>
     <l n="7">Obedience , beauty , law , while Elenor Murray 's</l>
     <l n="8">Life was being weighed by Merival</l>
     <l n="9">Preached in disparagement of Merival</l>
     <l n="10">Upon a fatal Sunday , as it chanced ,</l>
     <l n="11">Too near to doom 's day for the clergyman .</l>
     <l n="12">For , as the word had gone about that waste</l>
     <l n="13">In lives preoccupied this Merival ,</l>
     <l n="14">And many talked of waste , and spoke a life</l>
     <l n="15">Where waste had been in whole or part — the pulpit</l>
     <l n="16">Should take a hand , thought Ferguson . And so</l>
     <l n="17">The Reverend Percy Ferguson preached thus</l>
     <l n="18">To a great audience and fashionable :</l>
     <l n="19">“ The hour 's need is a firmer faith in Christ ,</l>
     <l n="20">A closer hold on God , belief again</l>
     <l n="21">In sin 's reality ; the age 's vice</l>
     <l n="22">Is laughter over sin , the attitude</l>
     <l n="23">That sin is not ! ” And then to prove that sin</l>
     <l n="24">Is something real , he spoke of money sins</l>
     <l n="25">That bring the money panics , of the beauty</l>
     <l n="26">That lust corrupts , wound up with Athen 's story ,</l>
     <l n="27">Which sin decayed . And touching on this waste ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which was the current talk , what is this waste</l>
     <l n="29">Except a sin in life , the moral law</l>
     <l n="30">Transgressed , God mocked , the order of man 's life ,</l>
     <l n="31">And God 's will disobeyed ? Show me a life</l>
     <l n="32">That lives through Christ and none shall find a waste .</l>
     <l n="33">This clergyman some fifteen years before</l>
     <l n="34">Went on a hunt for Alma Bell , who taught</l>
     <l n="35">The art department of the school , and found</l>
     <l n="36">Enough to scare the school directors that</l>
     <l n="37">She burned with lawless love for Elenor Murray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="38">And made it seem the teacher 's reprimand</l>
     <l n="39">In school of Elenor Murray for her ways</l>
     <l n="40">Of strolling , riding with young men at night ,</l>
     <l n="41">Was moved by jealousy of Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="42">Being herself in love with Elenor Murray .</l>
     <l n="43">This clergyman laid what he found before</l>
     <l n="44">The school directors , Alma Bell was sent</l>
     <l n="45">Out of the school her way , and disappeared ....</l>
     <l n="46">But now , though fifteen years had passed , the story</l>
     <l n="47">Of Alma Bell and Elenor Murray crept</l>
     <l n="48">Like poisonous mist , scarce seen , around LeRoy .</l>
     <l n="49">It had been so always . And all these years</l>
     <l n="50">No one would touch or talk in open words</l>
     <l n="51">The loathsome matter , since girls grown to women ,</l>
     <l n="52">And married in the town might have their names</l>
     <l n="53">Relinked to Alma Bell 's . And was it true</l>
     <l n="54">That Elenor Murray strayed as a young girl</l>
     <l n="55">In those far days of strolls and buggy rides ?</l>

     <l n="56">But after Percy Ferguson had thundered</l>
     <l n="57">Against the inquest , Warren Henderson ,</l>
     <l n="58">A banker of the city , who had dealt</l>
     <l n="59">In paper of the clergyman , and knew</l>
     <l n="60">The clergyman had interests near Victoria ,</l>
     <l n="61">Was playing at the money game , and knew</l>
     <l n="62">He tottered on the brink , and held to hands</l>
     <l n="63">That feared to hold him longer — Henderson ,</l>
     <l n="64">A wise man , cynical , contemptuous</l>
     <l n="65">Of frocks so sure of ways to avoid the waste ,</l>
     <l n="66">So unforgiving of the tangled moods</l>
     <l n="67">And baffled eyes of men ; contemptuous</l>
     <l n="68">Of frocks so avid for the downy beds ,</l>
     <l n="69">Place , honors , money , admiration , praise ,</l>
     <l n="70">Much wished to see the clergyman come down</l>
     <l n="71">And lay his life beside the other sinners .</l>
     <l n="72">But more he knew , admired this Alma Bell ,</l>
     <l n="73">Did not believe she burned with guilty love</l>
     <l n="74">For Elenor Murray , thought the moral hunt</l>
     <l n="75">Or Alma Bell had made a waste of life ,</l>
     <l n="76">As ignorance might pluck a flower for thinking</l>
     <l n="77">It was a weed ; on Elenor Murray too</l>
     <l n="78">Had brought a waste , by scenting up her life</l>
     <l n="79">With something faint but ineradicable .</l>
     <l n="80">And Warren Henderson would have revenge ,</l>
     <l n="81">And waited till old Jacob Bangs should fix</l>
     <l n="82">His name to paper once again of Ferguson 's</l>
     <l n="83">To tell old Jacob Bangs he should be wary ,</l>
     <l n="84">Since banks and agencies were tremulous</l>
     <l n="85">With hints of failure at Victoria .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="86">So meeting Jacob Bangs the banker told him</l>
     <l n="87">What things were bruited , and warned the man</l>
     <l n="88">To fix his name no more to Ferguson 's paper .</l>
     <l n="89">It was the very day the clergyman</l>
     <l n="90">Sought Jacob Bangs to get his signature</l>
     <l n="91">Upon a note for money at the bank .</l>
     <l n="92">And Jacob Bangs was silent and evasive ,</l>
     <l n="93">Demurred a little and refused at last .</l>
     <l n="94">Which sent the anxious clergyman adrift</l>
     <l n="95">To look for other help . He looked and looked ,</l>
     <l n="96">And found no other help . Associates</l>
     <l n="97">Depending more on men than God , fell down ,</l>

     <l n="215">For David Borrow , sunny pessimist ,</l>
     <l n="216">Thrust logic words at Maiworm , the juryman ;</l>

     <l n="1">You 've heard of potters ’ wheels and potters ’ hands .</l>
     <l n="2">I had a dream that told the human tale</l>

     <l n="4">I saw a great hand slopping plasmic jelly</l>
     <l n="5">Around the low sides of a giant bowl .</l>
     <l n="6">A drop would fly upon the giant table ,</l>
     <l n="7">And quick the drop would twist up into form ,</l>
     <l n="8">Become homonculus and wave its hands ,</l>
     <l n="9">Brandish a little pistol , shoot a creature ,</l>
     <l n="10">Upspringing from another drop of plasm ,</l>
     <l n="11">Slopped on the giant table . Other drops ,</l>
     <l n="12">Flying as water from a grinding stone ,</l>
     <l n="13">Out of the giant bowl , took little crowns</l>
     <l n="14">And put them on their heads and mounted thrones ,</l>
     <l n="15">And lorded little armies . Some became</l>
     <l n="16">Half-drooped and sickly things , like poisoned flies .</l>
     <l n="17">And others stood on lighted faggots , others</l>
     <l n="18">Fed and commanded , others served and starved ,</l>
     <l n="19">But many joined the throng of animate drops ,</l>

     <l n="25">Invest it with a malice , wanton humor ,</l>
     <l n="26">Which likes to see the plasmic jelly slop ,</l>
     <l n="27">And rain in drops upon the giant table ,</l>
     <l n="28">And does not care what happens in the world ,</l>

     <l n="3">Before they had the rope , knotted behind</l>
     <l n="4">The ear to break the neck . These two I hanged ,</l>
     <l n="5">One guilty and defiant , taking chops ,</l>
     <l n="6">Four cups of coffee just an hour before</l>
     <l n="7">We swung him off ; the other trembling , pale ,</l>

     <l n="14">Well , there 's a moment when the steer is standing</l>
     <l n="15">Head , neck strained side-ways , eyes rolled side-ways too ,</l>
     <l n="16">Fixed , bright seen this way , but another way</l>

     <l n="228">To spy on Gertrude , by the path in the grass</l>
     <l n="229">Lay for long hours . And on the third night saw</l>
     <l n="230">At half-past eight or nine this fellow come</l>
     <l n="231">And take her walking in the darkness — where ?</l>
     <l n="232">I could have touched them as they walked the path ,</l>

    <head>THE GOVERNOR</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I 'm home at last . How long were you asleep ?</l>
     <l n="2">I startled you . The time ? It 's midnight past .</l>
     <l n="3">Put on your slippers and your robe , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="4">And make some coffee for me — what a night !</l>
     <l n="5">Yes , tell you ? I shall tell you everything .</l>
     <l n="6">I must tell someone , and a wife should know</l>
     <l n="7">The workings of a governor 's mind — no one</l>
     <l n="8">Could guess what turned the scale to save this man</l>
     <l n="9">Who would have died to-morrow , but for me .</l>
     <l n="10">That 's fine . This coffee helps me . As I said</l>
     <l n="11">This night has been a trial . Well , you know</l>
     <l n="12">I told these lawyers they could come at eight ,</l>
     <l n="13">And so they came . A seasoned lawyer one ,</l>
     <l n="14">The other young and radical , both full</l>
     <l n="15">Of sentiment of some sort . And there you sit ,</l>
     <l n="16">And do not say a word of disapproval .</l>
     <l n="17">You smile , which means you sun yourself within</l>
     <l n="18">The power I have , and yet do you approve ?</l>
     <l n="19">This man committed brutal murder , did</l>
     <l n="20">A nameless horror ; now he 's saved from death .</l>
     <l n="21">The father and the mother of the girl ,</l>
     <l n="22">The neighborhood , perhaps , in which she lived</l>
     <l n="23">Will roar against me , think that I was bought ,</l>
     <l n="24">Or used by someone I 'm indebted to</l>
     <l n="25">In politics . Oh no ! It 's really funny ,</l>
     <l n="26">Since it is simpler than such things as these .</l>
     <l n="27">And no one , saving you , shall know the secret .</l>
     <l n="28">For there I sat and did n't say a word</l>
     <l n="29">To indicate , betray my thought ; not when</l>
     <l n="30">The thing came out that moved me . Let them read</l>
     <l n="31">The doctor 's affidavits , that this man</l>
     <l n="32">Was crazy when he killed the girl , and read</l>
     <l n="33">The transcript of the evidence on the trial .</l>
     <l n="34">They read and talked . At last the younger lawyer ,</l>
     <l n="35">For sometime still , kept silent by the other ,</l>
     <l n="36">Pops out with something , reads an affidavit ,</l>
     <l n="37">As foreign to the matter as a story</l>
     <l n="38">Of melodrama color on the screen ,</l>
     <l n="39">Which still contained a sentence that went home ;</l>
     <l n="40">I felt my mind turn like a turn-table ,</l>
     <l n="41">And click as when the switchman kicks the tongue</l>
     <l n="42">Of steel into the slot that holds the table .</l>
     <l n="43">And from my mind the engine , that 's the problem ,</l>
     <l n="44">Puffed , puffed and moved away , out on the track ,</l>
     <l n="45">And disappeared upon its business . How</l>
     <l n="46">Is that for metaphor ? Your coffee , dear ,</l>
     <l n="47">Stirs up my fancy . But to tell the rest ,</l>
     <l n="48">If my face changed expression , or my eye</l>
     <l n="49">Betrayed my thought , then I have no control</l>
     <l n="50">Of outward seeming . For they argued on</l>
     <l n="51">An hour or so thereafter . And I asked</l>
     <l n="52">Re-reading of the transcript where this man</l>
     <l n="53">Told of his maniac passion , of the night</l>
     <l n="54">He killed the girl , the doctors ’ testimony</l>
     <l n="55">I had re-read , and let these lawyers think</l>
     <l n="56">My interest centered there , and my decision</l>
     <l n="57">Was based upon such matters , and at last</l>
     <l n="58">The penalty commuted . When in truth</l>
     <l n="59">I tell you I had let the fellow hang</l>
     <l n="60">For all of this , except that I took fire</l>
     <l n="61">Because of something in this affidavit</l>
     <l n="62">Irrelevant to the issue , reaching me</l>
     <l n="63">In something only relevant to me .</l>
     <l n="64">O , well , all life is such . Our great decisions</l>
     <l n="65">Flame out of sparks , where roaring fires before ,</l>
     <l n="66">Not touching our combustibles wholly failed</l>

     <l n="74">For knowing how and when I got these books ,</l>
     <l n="75">Who woke my interest in them . Never mind ,</l>

     <l n="82">It was that morning when I passed my crisis ,</l>
     <l n="83">Had just dodged death , could scarcely speak , too weak</l>
     <l n="84">To lift a hand to feed myself , but needed</l>
     <l n="85">Vital replenishment of strength , and then</l>
     <l n="86">I got it in a bowl of oyster soup ,</l>
     <l n="87">Rich cream at that . And as I live , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="88">As this young lawyer read , I felt myself</l>
     <l n="89">In bed as I lay then , re-lived the weakness ,</l>
     <l n="90">Could see the spoon that carried to my mouth</l>
     <l n="91">The appetizing soup , imagined there</l>
     <l n="92">The feelings I had then of getting fingers</l>
     <l n="93">Upon the rail of life again , how faint ,</l>
     <l n="94">But with such clear degrees . Could see the hand</l>
     <l n="95">That held the spoon , the eyes that looked at me</l>
     <l n="96">In triumph for the victory of my strength ,</l>
     <l n="97">Which battled , almost lost the prize of life .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="104">That affidavit , doubtless</l>

     <l n="112">Knew this , and did he know it ? I do n't know .</l>
     <l n="113">Had Elenor Murray lived she would have come</l>

     <l n="115">And at the last , I think this was the thing :</l>
     <l n="116">I thought I 'd do exactly what I 'd do</l>
     <l n="117">If she had lived and asked me , disregard</l>

     <l n="123">You get my story Merival ? Do you think ,</l>
     <l n="124">A softness in the heart went to the brain</l>
     <l n="125">And softened that ? Well now I stress two things :</l>
     <l n="126">I can n't endure defeat , nor bear to see</l>
     <l n="127">An ardent spirit thwarted . What I 've achieved</l>
     <l n="128">Has been through will that would not bend , and so</l>
     <l n="129">To see that in another wins my love ,</l>
     <l n="130">And my support . Now take this Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="131">She had a will like mine , she worked her way</l>
     <l n="132">As I have done . And just to hear that she</l>
     <l n="133">Had planned to see me , ask for clemency</l>
     <l n="134">For this condemned degenerate , made me say</l>
     <l n="135">Shall I let death defeat her ? Take the breach</l>
     <l n="136">And make her death no matter in my course ?</l>
     <l n="137">For as I live if she had come to me</l>
     <l n="138">I had done that I did . And why was that ?</l>
     <l n="139">No romance ! Never that ! Yet human love</l>
     <l n="140">As friend can keep for friend in this our life</l>
     <l n="141">I felt for Elenor Murray — and for this :</l>
     <l n="142">It was her will that would not take defeat ,</l>
     <l n="143">Devotion to her work , and in my case</l>
     <l n="144">This depth of friendship welling in her heart</l>
     <l n="145">For human beings , that I shared in — there</l>
     <l n="146">Gave tireless healing to her nursing hands</l>
     <l n="147">And saved my life . And for a life a life .</l>
     <l n="148">This criminal will live some years , we 'll say ,</l>
     <l n="149">Were better dead . All right . He 'll cost the state</l>
     <l n="150">Say twenty thousand dollars . What is that</l>
     <l n="151">Contrasted with the cost to me , if I</l>
     <l n="152">Had let him hang ? There is a bank account ,</l>
     <l n="153">Economies in the realm of thought to watch .</l>
     <l n="154">And do n't you think the souls — let 's call them souls —</l>
     <l n="155">Of these avenging , law abiding folk ,</l>
     <l n="156">These souls of the community all in all</l>
     <l n="157">Will be improved for hearing that I did</l>
     <l n="158">A human thing , and profit more therefrom</l>
     <l n="159">Than though that sense of balance in their souls</l>
     <l n="160">Struck for the thought of crime avenged , the law</l>
     <l n="161">Fulfilled and vindicated ? Yes , it 's true .</l>
     <l n="162">And Merival spoke up and said : “ It 's true ,</l>
     <l n="163">I understand your story , and I 'm glad .</l>
     <l n="164">It 's like you and I 'll tell my jury first ,</l>

     <l n="167">The talk of waste in human life was constant</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">You see I worked for Arthur Fouche , he said ,</l>
     <l n="2">Until the year before he died ; I knew</l>
     <l n="3">That worthless son of his who lived with him ,</l>
     <l n="4">Born when his mother was past bearing time ,</l>
     <l n="5">So born a weakling . When he came from college</l>
     <l n="6">He married soon and came to mother 's hearth ,</l>
     <l n="7">And brought his bride . I heard the old man say :</l>
     <l n="8">“ A man should have his own place when he marries ,</l>
     <l n="9">Not settle in the family nest ” ; I heard</l>
     <l n="10">The old man offer him a place , or offer</l>
     <l n="11">To buy a place for him . This baby boy</l>
     <l n="12">Ran quick to mother , cried and asked to stay .</l>
     <l n="13">What happened then ? What always happens . Soon</l>
     <l n="14">This son began to edge upon the father ,</l>
     <l n="15">And take the reins a little , Arthur Fouche</l>
     <l n="16">Was growing old . And at the last the son</l>
     <l n="17">Controlled the bank account and ran the farms ;</l>
     <l n="18">And Mrs. Fouche gave up her place at table</l>
     <l n="19">To daughter-in-law , no longer served or poured</l>
     <l n="20">The coffee — so you see how humble beggars</l>
     <l n="21">Become the masters , it is always so .</l>
     <l n="22">Now this I know : When this boy came from school</l>
     <l n="23">And brought his wife back to the family place ,</l>
     <l n="24">Old Arthur Fouche had twenty thousand dollars</l>
     <l n="25">On saving in the bank , and lots of money</l>
     <l n="26">Loaned out on mortgages . But when he died</l>
     <l n="27">He owed two thousand dollars at the bank .</l>
     <l n="28">Where did the money go ? Why , for ten years</l>
     <l n="29">When Arthur Fouche and son were partners , I</l>
     <l n="30">Saw what went on , and saw this boy buy cattle</l>
     <l n="31">When beef was high , sell cattle when it was low ,</l>
     <l n="32">And lose each year a little . And I saw</l>
     <l n="33">This boy buy buggies , autos and machinery ,</l>
     <l n="34">And lose the money trading . So it was ,</l>
     <l n="35">This worthless boy had nothing in his head</l>
     <l n="36">To run a business , which used up the fortune</l>
     <l n="37">Of Arthur Fouche , and strangled Arthur Fouche ,</l>
     <l n="38">As vines destroy an oak tree . Well , you know</l>
     <l n="39">When Arthur Fouche 's will was opened up</l>
     <l n="40">They found this son was willed most everything —</l>
     <l n="41">It 's always so . The children who go out ,</l>
     <l n="42">And make their way get nothing , and the son</l>
     <l n="43">Who stays at home by mother gets the swag .</l>
     <l n="44">And so this son was willed the family place</l>
     <l n="45">And sold it to that chiropractor — left</l>
     <l n="46">For California to remake his life ,</l>
     <l n="47">And died there , after wasting all his life ,</l>
     <l n="48">His father 's fortune , too .</l>

     <l n="49">So , now to show you</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="52">This Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="53">Was eighteen , just from High School , and one day</l>
     <l n="54">She came to see her grandfather and talked .</l>
     <l n="55">The old man always said he loved her most</l>
     <l n="56">Of all the grandchildren , and Mrs. Fouche</l>
     <l n="57">Told me a dozen times she thought as much</l>
     <l n="58">Of Elenor Murray as she did of any</l>
     <l n="59">Child of her own . Too bad they did n't show</l>
     <l n="60">Their love for her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="61">I was in and out the room</l>
     <l n="62">Where Elenor Murray and her grandfather</l>
     <l n="63">Were talking on that day , was planing doors</l>
     <l n="64">That swelled and would n't close . There was no secret</l>
     <l n="65">About this talk of theirs that I could see ,</l>
     <l n="66">And so I listened .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="67">Elenor began :</l>
     <l n="68">“ If you can help me , grandpa , just a little</l>
     <l n="69">I can go through the university .</l>
     <l n="70">I can teach school in summer and can save</l>
     <l n="71">A little money by denying self .</l>
     <l n="72">If you can let me have two hundred dollars ,</l>
     <l n="73">When school begins each year , divide it up ,</l>
     <l n="74">If you prefer , and give me half in the fall ,</l>
     <l n="75">And half in March , perhaps , I can get through .</l>
     <l n="76">And when I finish I shall go to work</l>
     <l n="77">And pay you back , I want it as a loan ,</l>
     <l n="78">And do not ask it for a gift . ” She sat ,</l>
     <l n="79">And fingered at her dress while asking him ,</l>
     <l n="80">And Arthur Fouche looked at her . Come to think</l>
     <l n="81">He was toward eighty then . At last he said :</l>
     <l n="82">“ I wish I could do what you ask me , Elenor ,</l>
     <l n="83">But there are several things . You see , my child ,</l>
     <l n="84">I have been through this thing of educating</l>
     <l n="85">A family of children , lived my life</l>
     <l n="86">In that regard , and so have done my part .</l>
     <l n="87">I sent your mother to St. Mary 's , sent</l>
     <l n="88">The rest of them wherever they desired .</l>
     <l n="89">And that 's what every father owes his children .</l>
     <l n="90">And when he does it , he has done his duty .</l>
     <l n="91">I 'm sorry that your father cannot help you ,</l>
     <l n="92">And I would help you , though I 've done my duty</l>
     <l n="93">By those to whom I owed it ; but you see</l>
     <l n="94">Your uncle and myself are partners buying</l>
     <l n="95">And selling cattle , and the business lags .</l>
     <l n="96">We do not profit much , and all the money</l>
     <l n="97">I have in bank is needed for this business .</l>
     <l n="98">We buy the cattle , and we buy the corn ,</l>
     <l n="99">Then we run short of corn ; and now and then</l>
     <l n="100">I have to ask the bank to lend us money ,</l>
     <l n="101">And give my note . Last month I borrowed money ! ”</l>
     <l n="102">And so the old man talked . And as I looked</l>
     <l n="103">I saw the tears run down her cheeks . She sat</l>
     <l n="104">And looked as if she did n't believe him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="105">No ,</l>
     <l n="106">Why should she ? For I do not understand</l>
     <l n="107">Why in a case like this , a man who 's worth ,</l>
     <l n="108">Say fifty thousand dollars could n't spare</l>
     <l n="109">Two hundred dollars by the year . Let 's see :</l>
     <l n="110">He might have bought less corn or cattle , gambled</l>
     <l n="111">On lucky sales of cattle — there 's a way</l>
     <l n="112">To do a big thing when you have the eyes</l>
     <l n="113">To see how big it is ; and as for me ,</l>
     <l n="114">If money must be lost , I 'd rather lose it</l>
     <l n="115">On Elenor Murray than on cattle . In fact ,</l>
     <l n="116">That 's where the money went , as I have said .</l>
     <l n="117">And Elenor Murray went away and earned</l>
     <l n="118">Two terms at college , and this worthless son</l>
     <l n="119">Ate up and spent the money . All of them ,</l>
     <l n="120">The son and Arthur Fouche and Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="121">Are gone to dust , now , like the garden things</l>
     <l n="122">That sprout up , fall and rot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="123">At times it seems</l>
     <l n="124">All waste to me , no matter what you do</l>
     <l n="125">For self or others , unless you think of turnips</l>
     <l n="126">Which can n't be much to turnips , but are good</l>
     <l n="127">For us who raise them . Here 's my story then ,</l>
     <l n="128">Good wishes to you , Coroner Merival .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="129">Coroner Merival heard that Gottlieb Gerald</l>

     <l n="131">And knew her love for music , how she tried</l>
     <l n="132">To play on the piano . On an evening</l>
     <l n="133">He went with Winthrop Marion to the place ,—</l>
     <l n="134">Llewellyn George dropped in to hear , as well —</l>
     <l n="135">Where Gottlieb Gerald sold pianos — dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="136">Read Kant at times , a scholar , but a failure ,</l>
     <l n="137">His life a waste in business . Gottlieb Gerald</l>

     <l n="1">I knew her , why of course . And you want me ?</l>
     <l n="2">What can I say ? I do n't know how she died .</l>
     <l n="3">I know what people say . But if you want</l>
     <l n="4">To hear about her , as I knew the girl ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sit down a minute . Wait , a customer !...</l>
     <l n="6">It was a fellow with a bill , these fellows</l>
     <l n="7">Who come for money make me smile . Good God !</l>
     <l n="8">Where shall I get the money , when pianos ,</l>
     <l n="9">Such as I make , are devilish hard to sell ?</l>
     <l n="10">Now listen to this tune ! Dumm , dumm , dumm , dumm ,</l>
     <l n="11">How 's that for quality , sweet clear and pure ?</l>
     <l n="12">Now listen to these chords I take from Bach !</l>
     <l n="13">Oh no , I never played much , just for self .</l>
     <l n="14">Well , you might say my passion for this work</l>
     <l n="15">Is due to this : I pick the wire strings ,</l>
     <l n="16">The spruce boards and all that for instruments</l>
     <l n="17">That suit my ear at last . When I have built</l>
     <l n="18">A piano , then I sit and play upon it ,</l>
     <l n="19">And find forgetfulness and rapture through it .</l>
     <l n="20">And well I need forgetfulness , for the bills</l>
     <l n="21">Are never paid , collectors always come .</l>
     <l n="22">I keep a little lawyer almost busy ,</l>
     <l n="23">Lest some one get a judgment , levy a writ</l>
     <l n="24">Upon my prizes here , this one in chief .</l>
     <l n="25">Oh , well , I pay at last , I always pay ,</l>
     <l n="26">But I must have my time . And in the days</l>
     <l n="27">When these collectors swarm too much I find</l>
     <l n="28">Oblivion in music , run my hands</l>
     <l n="29">Over the keys I 've tuned . I wish I had</l>
     <l n="30">Some life of Cristofori , just to see</l>
     <l n="31">If he was dodging bills when tuning strings .</l>
     <l n="32">Perhaps that Silberman who made pianos</l>
     <l n="33">For Frederick the Great had money enough ,</l>
     <l n="34">And needed no oblivion from bills .</l>
     <l n="35">You see I 'm getting old now , sixty-eight ;</l>
     <l n="36">And this I say , that life is far too short</l>
     <l n="37">For man to use his conquests and his wisdoms .</l>
     <l n="38">This spirit , mind , is a machine , piano ,</l>
     <l n="39">And has its laws of harmony and use .</l>
     <l n="40">Well , it seems funny that a man just learns</l>
     <l n="41">The secrets of his being , how to love ,</l>
     <l n="42">How to forget , what to select , what life</l>
     <l n="43">Is natural to him , and only living</l>
     <l n="44">According to one 's nature is increase —</l>
     <l n="45">All else is waste — when wind blows on your back ,</l>
     <l n="46">Just as I sit sometimes when these collectors</l>
     <l n="47">Come in on me — and so you find it 's Death ,</l>
     <l n="48">Who levies on your life ; no little lawyer</l>
     <l n="49">Can keep him off with stays of execution ,</l>
     <l n="50">Or supersedeas , I think it is .</l>
     <l n="51">Well , as I said , a man must live his nature ,</l>
     <l n="52">And dump the rules ; this Christianity</l>
     <l n="53">Makes people wear steel corsets to grow straight ,</l>
     <l n="54">And they do n't grow so , for they scarcely breathe ,</l>
     <l n="55">They 're laced so tight ; and all their vital organs</l>
     <l n="56">Are piled up and repressed until they groan .</l>
     <l n="57">Then what ? They lace up tighter , till the blood</l>
     <l n="58">Stops in the veins and numbness comes upon them .</l>
     <l n="59">Oblivion it may be — but give me music !</l>

     <l n="86">Wine made from wild grapes spiced with cinnamon ,</l>
     <l n="87">It had a kick , too . And the home was furnished</l>
     <l n="88">Like what you 'd think : good carpets , chairs , a lounge ,</l>
     <l n="89">Some pictures on the wall — all good enough .</l>
     <l n="90">And this girl was as lively as a cricket ,</l>
     <l n="91">She was the liveliest thing I ever saw ;</l>
     <l n="92">And that 's what ailed her , if you want my word .</l>
     <l n="93">She had more life than she knew how to use ,</l>
     <l n="94">And had not learned her own machine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="95">And after</l>
     <l n="96">We had the dinner we came in the parlor .</l>
     <l n="97">And then her mother asked her to play something ,</l>
     <l n="98">And she sat down and played tra-la ; tra-la ,</l>
     <l n="99">One of these waltzes , I remember now</l>
     <l n="100">As pretty as these verses in the paper</l>
     <l n="101">On love , or something sentimental . Yes ,</l>
     <l n="102">She played it well . For I had rented them</l>
     <l n="103">One of my pets . They asked me then to play</l>
     <l n="104">And I tried out some Bach and other things ,</l>
     <l n="105">And improvised . And Elenor stood by ,</l>
     <l n="106">And asked what 's that when I was improvising .</l>
     <l n="107">I laughed and said , Sonata of Starved Rock ,</l>
     <l n="108">Or Deer Park Glen in Winter , anything —</l>
     <l n="109">She looked at me with eyes as big as that .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="110">Well , as I said , the home was good enough .</l>
     <l n="111">Still like myself with these collectors , Elenor</l>
     <l n="112">Was bothered , drawn aside , and scratched no doubt</l>
     <l n="113">From walking through the briars . Just the same</l>
     <l n="114">The trouble with her life , if it was trouble ,</l>
     <l n="115">And no musician would regard it trouble ,</l>
     <l n="116">The trouble was her nature strove to be</l>
     <l n="117">All fire , and subtilize to the essence of fire ,</l>
     <l n="118">Which was her nature 's law , and Nature 's law ,</l>
     <l n="119">The only normal law , as I have found ;</l>
     <l n="120">For so Canudo says , as I read lately ,</l>
     <l n="121">Who gave me words for what I knew from life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="122">Now if you want my theories I go on .</l>
     <l n="123">You do ? All right . What was this Elenor Murray ?</l>
     <l n="124">She was the lover , do you understand ?</l>
     <l n="125">She had her lovers maybe , I do n't know ,</l>
     <l n="126">That 's not the point with lovers , any more ,</l>
     <l n="127">Than it 's the point to have pianos — no !</l>
     <l n="128">Lovers , pianos are the self-same thing ;</l>
     <l n="129">Instruments for the soul , the source of fire ,</l>
     <l n="130">The crucible for flames that turn from red</l>
     <l n="131">To blue , then white , then fierce transparencies .</l>
     <l n="132">Then if the lover be not known by lovers</l>
     <l n="133">How is she known ? Why think of Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="134">Who tries all things and educates herself ,</l>
     <l n="135">Goes traveling , would sing and play , becomes</l>
     <l n="136">A member of a church with ritual , music ,</l>
     <l n="137">Incense and color , things that steal the senses ,</l>
     <l n="138">And bring oblivion . Do n't you see the girl</l>
     <l n="139">Moving her soul to find her soul , and passing</l>
     <l n="140">Through loves and hatreds , seeking everywhere</l>
     <l n="141">Herself she loved , in others , agonizing</l>
     <l n="142">For hate of father , so they tell me now ?</l>
     <l n="143">But first because she hated in herself</l>
     <l n="144">What lineaments of her father she saw in self .</l>
     <l n="145">And all the while , I think , she strove to conquer</l>
     <l n="146">This hatred , every hatred , sensing freedom</l>
     <l n="147">For her own soul through liberating self</l>
     <l n="148">From hatreds . So , you see how someone near ,</l>
     <l n="149">Repugnant , disesteemed , may furnish strength</l>
     <l n="150">And vision , too , by gazing on that one</l>
     <l n="151">From day to day , not to be like that one :</l>
     <l n="152">And so our hatreds help us , those we hate</l>
     <l n="153">Become our saviors .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="154">Here 's the problem now</l>
     <l n="155">In finding self , the soul — it 's with ourselves ,</l>
     <l n="156">Within ourselves throughout the ticklish quest</l>
     <l n="157">From first to last , and lovers and pianos</l>
     <l n="158">Are instruments of salvation , yet they take</l>
     <l n="159">The self but to the self , and say now find ,</l>
     <l n="160">Explore and know . And then , as all before ,</l>
     <l n="161">The problem is how much of mind to use ,</l>
     <l n="162">How much of instinct , phototropic sense ,</l>
     <l n="163">That turns instinctively to light — green worms</l>
     <l n="164">More plant than animal are eyes all over</l>
     <l n="165">Because their bodies know the light , no eyes</l>
     <l n="166">Where sight is centralized . I 've found it now :</l>
     <l n="167">What is the intellect but eyes , where sight</l>
     <l n="168">Is gathered in two spheres ? The more they 're used</l>
     <l n="169">The darker is the body of the soul .</l>
     <l n="170">Now to digress , that 's why the Germans lost ,</l>
     <l n="171">They used the intellect too much ; they took</l>
     <l n="172">The sea of life and tried to dam it in ,</l>
     <l n="173">Or use it for canals or water power ,</l>
     <l n="174">Or make a card-case system of it , maybe ,</l>
     <l n="175">To keep collectors off , have all run smoothly ,</l>
     <l n="176">And make a sure thing of it .</l>

     <l n="177">To return</l>
     <l n="178">How much did Elenor Murray use her mind ,</l>
     <l n="179">How much her instincts , leave herself alone</l>
     <l n="180">Let nature have its way ? I think I know :</l>
     <l n="181">But first you have the artist soul ; and next</l>
     <l n="182">The soul half artist , prisoned usually</l>
     <l n="183">In limitations where the soul , half artist</l>
     <l n="184">Between depressions and discouragements</l>
     <l n="185">Rises in hope and knocks . Why , I can tell them</l>
     <l n="186">The moment they touch keys or talk to me .</l>
     <l n="187">I hear their knuckles knocking on the walls ,</l>
     <l n="188">Insuperable partitions made of wood ,</l>
     <l n="189">When seeking tones or words ; they have the hint ,</l>
     <l n="190">But cannot open , manifest themselves .</l>
     <l n="191">So was it with this girl , she was all lover ,</l>
     <l n="192">Half artist , what a torture for a soul ,</l>
     <l n="193">And what escape for her ! She could not play ,</l>
     <l n="194">Had never played , no matter what the chance .</l>
     <l n="195">I think there is no curse like being dumb</l>
     <l n="196">When every waking moment , every dream</l>
     <l n="197">Keeps crying to speak out . This is her case :</l>
     <l n="198">The girl was dumb , like that dumb woman here</l>
     <l n="199">Whose dress caught fire , and in the dining room</l>
     <l n="200">Was burned to death while all her family</l>
     <l n="201">Were in the house , to whom she could not cry !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="202">You asked about her going to the war ,</l>
     <l n="203">Her sacrifice in that , and if I think</l>
     <l n="204">She found expression there — yes , of a kind ,</l>
     <l n="205">But not the kind she hungered for , not music .</l>
     <l n="206">She found adventure there , excitement too .</l>
     <l n="207">That uses up the soul 's power , takes the place</l>
     <l n="208">Of better self-expression . But you see</l>
     <l n="209">I do not think self-immolation life ,</l>
     <l n="210">I know it to be death . Now , look a minute :</l>
     <l n="211">Why did she join the church ? why to forget !</l>
     <l n="212">Why did she go to war ? why to forget .</l>
     <l n="213">And at the last , this thing called sacrifice</l>
     <l n="214">Rose up with meaning in her eyes . You see</l>
     <l n="215">They tell around here now she often said :</l>
     <l n="216">“ I 'm going to the war to be swept under . ”</l>
     <l n="217">Now comes your Christian idea : Let me die ,</l>

     <l n="219">I waste myself for others , give myself !</l>
     <l n="220">Let God take notice , and reward the gift !</l>
     <l n="221">This is the failure 's recourse often-times ,</l>
     <l n="222">A prodigal flinging of the self — let God</l>
     <l n="223">Find what He can of good , or find all good .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In Lola Schaefer 's studio in the Tower ,</l>
     <l n="2">Tea being served to painters , poets , singers ,</l>
     <l n="3">Herr Ludwig Haibt , a none too welcome guest ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of vital body , brisk , too loud of voice ,</l>
     <l n="5">And Lilli Alm crossed swords .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">It came about</l>
     <l n="7">When Ludwig Haibt said : “ Have you read the papers</l>
     <l n="8">About this Elenor Murray ? ” And then said :</l>
     <l n="9">“ I tried to train her voice — she was a failure . ”</l>
     <l n="10">And Lilli Alm who taught the art of song</l>
     <l n="11">Looked at him half contemptuous and said :</l>
     <l n="12">“ Why did she fail ? ” To which Herr Ludwig answered</l>
     <l n="13">“ She tried too hard . She made her throat too tense ,</l>
     <l n="14">And made its muscles stiff by too much thought ,</l>
     <l n="15">Anxiety for song , the vocal triumph . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">“ O , yes , I understand , ” said Lilli Aim .</l>
     <l n="17">Then stabbing him she added , “ since you dropped</l>
     <l n="18">The Perfect Institute , and dropped the idea</l>
     <l n="19">Which stresses training muscles of the tongue ,</l>
     <l n="20">And all that thing , be fair and shoulder half</l>
     <l n="21">The failure of poor Elenor Murray on</l>
     <l n="22">Your system 's failure . For I chanced to know</l>
     <l n="23">The girl myself . She started work with me ,</l>
     <l n="24">And I am sure that if I had been able —</l>
     <l n="25">With time enough I could have done it too —</l>
     <l n="26">To rid her mind of muscles and to fix</l>
     <l n="27">The thought alone of music in her mind ,</l>
     <l n="28">She would have sung . Now listen , Ludwig Haibt ,</l>
     <l n="29">You 've come around to see that song 's the thing .</l>
     <l n="30">I take a pupil and I say to her :</l>
     <l n="31">The mind must fix itself on music , say</l>
     <l n="32">I would make song , pure tones and beautiful ;</l>
     <l n="33">That comes from spirit , from the Plato rapture ,</l>
     <l n="34">Which gets the idea . It is well to know</l>
     <l n="35">Some physiology , I grant , to know</l>
     <l n="36">When , how to move the vocal organs , feel</l>
     <l n="37">How they are moving , through the ear to place</l>
     <l n="38">These organs in relation , and to know</l>
     <l n="39">The soft palate is drawn against the hard ;</l>
     <l n="40">The tongue can take positions numerous ,</l>
     <l n="41">Can be used at the root , a throaty voice ;</l>
     <l n="42">Or with the tip , produce expressiveness .</l>
     <l n="43">But what must we avoid ?— rigidity .</l>
     <l n="44">And if that girl was over-zealous , then</l>
     <l n="45">So much the more her teaching should have kept</l>
     <l n="46">Mind off the larynx and the tongue , and fixed</l>
     <l n="47">Upon the spiritual matters , so to give</l>
     <l n="48">The snake-like power of loosening , contracting</l>
     <l n="49">The muscles used for singing . Ludwig Haibt ,</l>
     <l n="50">I can forgive your system , since abandoned ,</l>
     <l n="51">I can n't forgive your words to-day who say</l>
     <l n="52">This woman failed for trying over much ,</l>
     <l n="53">When I know that your system made her throw</l>
     <l n="54">An energy truly wonderful on muscles ;</l>
     <l n="55">And when I think of your book where you said :</l>
     <l n="56">The singing voice is the result , observe</l>
     <l n="57">Of physical conditions , like the strings</l>
     <l n="58">Or tubes of brass . While granting that it 's well</l>
     <l n="59">To know the art of tuning up the strings ,</l>
     <l n="60">And how to place them ; after all the art</l>
     <l n="61">Of tuning and of placing comes from mind ,</l>
     <l n="62">The idea , and the art of making song</l>
     <l n="63">Is just the breathing of the perfect spirit</l>
     <l n="64">Upon the strings . The throat is but the leaves ,</l>
     <l n="65">Let them be flexible , the mouth 's the flower ,</l>
     <l n="66">The tone the perfume . And your olden way</l>
     <l n="67">Of harping on the larynx — well , since you</l>
     <l n="68">Turned from it , I 'm ungenerous perhaps</l>
     <l n="69">To scold you thus to-day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="70">But this I say ,</l>
     <l n="71">Let us be frank as teachers : Take the fetich</l>
     <l n="72">Of breathing and see how you cripple talent ,</l>
     <l n="73">Or take that matter of the laryngyscope ,</l>
     <l n="74">Whereby you photograph a singer 's throat ,</l>
     <l n="75">Caruso 's , Galli Curci 's at the moment</l>
     <l n="76">Of greatest beauty in song , and thus preserve</l>
     <l n="77">In photographs before you how the muscles</l>
     <l n="78">Looked and were placed that moment . Then attempt</l>
     <l n="79">To get the like effect by placing them</l>
     <l n="80">In similar fashion . Oh , you know , Herr Ludwig ,</l>
     <l n="81">These fetiches go by . One thing remains :</l>
     <l n="82">The idea in the soul of beauty , music ,</l>
     <l n="83">The hope to give it forth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="84">Alas ! to think</l>
     <l n="85">So many souls are wasted while we teach</l>

     <l n="87">But take this Elenor Murray — why , that girl</l>
     <l n="88">Was just a flame , I never saw such hunger</l>
     <l n="89">For self-development , and beauty , richness ,</l>

     <l n="91">That 's why I say so — take her as I say ,</l>
     <l n="92">And put her to a practice — yours we 'll say —</l>
     <l n="93">Where this great zeal she had is turned and pressed</l>
     <l n="94">Upon the physical , just the very thing</l>
     <l n="95">To make her throat constrict , and fill her up</l>
     <l n="96">With over anxiety and make her fail .</l>
     <l n="97">When had she come to me at first this passion</l>
     <l n="98">Directed to the beauty , the idea</l>
     <l n="99">Had put her soul at ease to ease her body ,</l>
     <l n="100">Which gradually and beautifully had answered</l>

     <l n="106">Since I have censured you , to my own sin .</l>
     <l n="107">This girl ran out of money , came to me</l>

     <l n="109">You will have money later , when you do ,</l>
     <l n="110">Come back to me . ” She stood a silent moment ,</l>
     <l n="111">Her hand upon the knob , I saw her tears ,</l>
     <l n="112">Just little dim tears , then she said good-bye</l>
     <l n="113">And vanished from me .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="114">Well , I now repent .</l>
     <l n="115">I who have thought of beauty all my life ,</l>

     <l n="117">Let slip a chance for beauty — why , I think ,</l>
     <l n="118">A beauty just as great as song ! You see</l>
     <l n="119">I had a chance to serve a hungering soul —</l>
     <l n="120">I could have said just let the money go ,</l>
     <l n="121">Or let it go until you get the money .</l>
     <l n="122">I let that chance for beauty slip . Even now</l>
     <l n="123">I see poor Elenor Murray at the door ,</l>
     <l n="124">Who paused , no doubt , in hope that I would say</l>
     <l n="125">What I thought not to say .</l>

     <l n="126">So , Ludwig Haibt ,</l>
     <l n="127">We are a poor lot — let us have some tea !</l>
     <l n="128">“ We are a poor lot , ” Ludwig Haibt replied .</l>
     <l n="129">“ But since this is confessional , I absolve you ,</l>
     <l n="130">If you 'll permit me , from your sin . Will you</l>

     <l n="132">I 'll tell you something , it is really true :—</l>
     <l n="133">I changed my system more I think because</l>
     <l n="134">Of what I learned from teaching Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="135">Than on account of any other person .</l>
     <l n="136">She demonstrated better where my system</l>
     <l n="137">Was lacking than all pupils that I had .</l>
     <l n="138">And so I changed it ; and of course I say</l>
     <l n="139">The thing is music , just as poets say</l>
     <l n="140">The thing is beauty , not the rhyme and words ,</l>
     <l n="141">With which they bring it , instruments that 's all ,</l>
     <l n="142">And not the thing — but beauty . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="143">So they talked ,</l>
     <l n="144">Forgave each other . And that very day</l>
     <l n="145">Two priests were talking of confessionals</l>
     <l n="146">A mile or so from the Tower , where Lilli Alm</l>
     <l n="147">And Ludwig Haibt were having tea . You say</l>
     <l n="148">The coroner was ignorant of this !</l>
     <l n="149">What is the part it plays with Elenor Murray ?</l>
     <l n="150">Or with the inquest ? Wait a little yet</l>
     <l n="151">And see if Merival has told to him</l>
     <l n="152">What thing of value touching Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="153">Is lodged in Father Whimsett 's heart or words .</l>

    <head>FATHER WHIMSETT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Looking like Raphael 's Perugino , eyes</l>
     <l n="2">So slightly , subtly aquiline , as brown</l>
     <l n="3">As a buck-eye , amorous , flamed , but lightly dimmed</l>
     <l n="4">Through thought of self while sitting for the artist ;</l>
     <l n="5">A nose well bridged with bone for will , the nostrils</l>
     <l n="6">Distended as if sniffing diaphanous fire ;</l>
     <l n="7">A very bow for lips , the under lip</l>
     <l n="8">Rich , kissable like a woman 's ; heavy cheeks</l>
     <l n="9">Propped with a rounded tower of flesh for neck :</l>
     <l n="10">Thus Perugino looked , says Raphael ,</l>
     <l n="11">And thus looked Father Whimsett at his desk ,</l>
     <l n="12">With vertical creases , where the nose and brow</l>
     <l n="13">Together come , between the eye-brows slanting</l>
     <l n="14">Unequally , half clown-wise , half Mephisto ,</l>
     <l n="15">With just a touch of that abandoned humor ,</l>
     <l n="16">And laughter at the world , the race of men ,</l>
     <l n="17">Mephisto had for mischief , which the priest</l>
     <l n="18">Has for a sense which looks upon the dream</l>
     <l n="19">And smiles , yet pities those who move in it .</l>
     <l n="20">And Father Whimsett smokes and reads and smiles .</l>
     <l n="21">He soon will hold confessional . For days</l>
     <l n="22">he has heard nothing but complaints of lovers ,</l>
     <l n="23">And searched for nullities , impediments ,</l>
     <l n="24">Through which to give sore stricken hearts relief :</l>
     <l n="25">There was the youth too drunk to know he married</l>
     <l n="26">A woman never baptized . Now the youth</l>
     <l n="27">Has found another — oh this is the one !</l>
     <l n="28">And comes and says : Oh , holy father , help me ,</l>
     <l n="29">May I be free to marry her I love ,</l>
     <l n="30">And get the church 's blessing when a court</l>
     <l n="31">Dissolves the civil contract ? Holy Father ,</l>
     <l n="32">I knew not what I did , cannot remember</l>
     <l n="33">Where I was married , when , my mind 's a blank —</l>
     <l n="34">It was the drink , you know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="35">And so it goes ,</l>
     <l n="36">The will is eyeless through concupiscence ,</l>
     <l n="37">And that absolves the soul that 's penitent .</l>
     <l n="38">And Father Whimsett reads his Latin books ,</l>
     <l n="39">Searches for subtleties for faithful souls ,</l>
     <l n="40">Whereby the faithful souls may have their wish ,</l>
     <l n="41">Yet keep the gospel , too .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="42">These Latin books</l>
     <l n="43">Leave him fatigued , but not fatigued to turn</l>
     <l n="44">Plotinus , Xenophon , Boccacio ,</l>
     <l n="45">Ars Amatoria and Remedia Amoris .</l>
     <l n="46">And just this moment Father Whimsett reads</l>
     <l n="47">Catullus , killing time , before he hears</l>
     <l n="48">Confession , gets the music of Catullus</l>
     <l n="49">Along the light that enters at the eye :</l>
     <l n="50">Etherial strings plucked by the intellect</l>
     <l n="51">To vibrate to the inner ear . At times</l>
     <l n="52">He must re-light his half-forgot cigar .</l>
     <l n="53">And while the music of the Latin verse ,</l>
     <l n="54">Which is an echo , as he stops to light</l>
     <l n="55">His half-forgot cigar , is wafted through</l>
     <l n="56">His meditation , as a tune is heard</l>
     <l n="57">After the keys are stayed , it blends , becomes</l>
     <l n="58">The soul , interpretation of these stories ,</l>
     <l n="59">Which lovers tell him in these later days .</l>
     <l n="60">And now the clock upon the mantel chimes</l>
     <l n="61">The quarter of the hour . Up goes Catullus</l>
     <l n="62">By Ovid on the shelf . The dead cigar</l>
     <l n="63">Is thrown away . He rises from the chair —</l>
     <l n="64">When Father Conway enters , just to visit</l>
     <l n="65">Some idle moments , smoke and have a talk .</l>
     <l n="66">And Father Whimsett takes his seat again ,</l>
     <l n="67">Waves Father Conway to a comfort chair ,</l>
     <l n="68">Says “ Have a smoke , ” and Father Conway smokes ,</l>
     <l n="69">And sees Catullus , says you read Catullus ,</l>
     <l n="70">And lays the morning Times upon the table ,</l>
     <l n="71">And says to Father Whimsett : “ Every day</l>
     <l n="72">The Times has stories better than Catullus ,</l>
     <l n="73">And episodes which Horace would have used .</l>
     <l n="74">I wish we had a poet who would take</l>
     <l n="75">This city of Chicago , write it up ,</l>
     <l n="76">The old Chicago , and the new Chicago ,</l>
     <l n="77">The race track , old cafes and gambling places ,</l>
     <l n="78">The prize fights , wrestling matches , sporting houses ,</l>
     <l n="79">As Horace wrote up Rome . Or if we had</l>
     <l n="80">A Virgil he would find an epic theme</l>
     <l n="81">In this American matter , typical</l>
     <l n="82">Of our America , one phase or more</l>
     <l n="83">Concerning Elenor Murray . Here to-day</l>
     <l n="84">There is a story , of some letters found</l>
     <l n="85">In Arthur Fouche 's mansion , under the floor ,</l>
     <l n="86">Sensational , dramatic .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="87">Father Whimsett</l>
     <l n="88">Looked steadily at Father Conway , blew</l>
     <l n="89">A funnel of tobacco smoke and said :</l>
     <l n="90">I scarcely read the Times these days , too busy —</l>
     <l n="91">I 've had a run of rich confessionals .</l>
     <l n="92">The war is ended , but they still come on ,</l>
     <l n="93">And most are lovers in the coils of love .</l>
     <l n="94">I had one yesterday that made me think</l>
     <l n="95">Of one I had a year ago last spring ,</l>
     <l n="96">The point was this : they say forgive me father ,</l>
     <l n="97">For I have sinned , then as the case proceeds</l>
     <l n="98">A greater sin comes forth , I mean the sin</l>
     <l n="99">Of saying sin is good , cannot be sin :</l>
     <l n="100">I loved the man , or how can love be sin ?</l>
     <l n="101">Well , as a human soul I see the point ,</l>
     <l n="102">But have no option , must lay to and say</l>
     <l n="103">Acknowledgment , contrition and the promise</l>
     <l n="104">To sin no more , is necessary to</l>
     <l n="105">Win absolution . Now to show the matter ,</l>
     <l n="106">Here comes a woman , says I leave for France</l>
     <l n="107">To serve , to die . I have a premonition</l>
     <l n="108">That I shall die abroad ; or if I live ,</l>
     <l n="109">I have had fears , I shall be taken , wronged ,</l>

     <l n="112">These fears of mine that you may search my heart ,</l>
     <l n="113">More gladly may absolve me . Then she says ,</l>
     <l n="114">These fears worked in my soul until I took</l>
     <l n="115">The step which I confess , before I leave .</l>
     <l n="116">I wait and she proceeds :</l>

     <l n="126">Well , here 's a pretty soul</l>

     <l n="129">Confessing it , denying it in one breath ,</l>
     <l n="130">Leaves you in sin without forgiveness .</l>

     <l n="141">Is less adultery in a case like this ?</l>
     <l n="142">“ Well , no , ” she says , “ but could he be divorced</l>
     <l n="143">The church would marry us . ” Go on , I said ,</l>
     <l n="144">And then she paused a little and went on :</l>
     <l n="145">“ I said I loved this man , and it is true ,</l>

     <l n="151">And crushed him out with work — was chaste for years .</l>
     <l n="152">And then I met a man , a different man</l>
     <l n="153">Who stirred me otherwise , kept after me .</l>
     <l n="154">At last I weakened , sinned three months ago ,</l>
     <l n="155">And suffered for it . For he took me , left me .</l>
     <l n="156">As if he wanted body of me alone ,</l>

     <l n="158">I think that I was mad , a furious passion</l>

     <l n="161">Went by , he did not seek me out , none knew</l>
     <l n="162">The hour of our departure . Then I thought</l>

     <l n="1">Carl Eaton and John Campbell both were raised</l>
     <l n="2">With Elenor Murray in LeRoy . The mother</l>
     <l n="3">Of Eaton lived there ; but these boys had gone ,</l>
     <l n="4">Now grown to manhood to Chicago , where</l>
     <l n="5">They kept the old days of companionship .</l>
     <l n="6">And Mrs. Eaton saw the coroner ,</l>
     <l n="7">And told him how she saved her son from Elenor ,</l>
     <l n="8">And broke their troth — because upon a time</l>
     <l n="9">Elenor Murray , though betrothed , to Carl</l>
     <l n="10">Went riding with John Campbell , and returned</l>
     <l n="11">At two o'clock in the morning , drunk , and stood</l>
     <l n="12">Helpless and weary , holding to the gate .</l>
     <l n="13">For which she broke the engagement of her son</l>
     <l n="14">To Elenor Murray . That was truth to her ,</l>
     <l n="15">And truth to Merival , for the time , at least .</l>
     <l n="16">But this John Campbell and Carl Eaton meet</l>
     <l n="17">One evening at a table drinking beer ,</l>

     <l n="34">This Alma Bell affair and ills at home</l>

     <l n="93">Who sell themselves do so , or now and then</l>
     <l n="94">A girl who is betrayed by hopes of marriage .</l>
     <l n="95">And here was thrust upon me something devilish :</l>
     <l n="96">The fair girl that I loved was wise already ,</l>
     <l n="97">And fooling me , and drinking in my love</l>
     <l n="98">In mockery of me . This was my first</l>
     <l n="99">Heart sickness , jaundice of the soul — dear me !</l>
     <l n="100">And how I suffered , lay awake of nights ,</l>
     <l n="101">And wondered , doubted , hoped , or cursed myself ,</l>
     <l n="102">And cursed the girl as well . And I would think</l>

     <l n="104">To me before she went with this Roy Green .</l>
     <l n="105">And I would hear the older men give hints</l>
     <l n="106">About their conquests , speak of ways and signs</l>
     <l n="107">From which to tell a woman . On the train</l>
     <l n="108">Hear drummers boast and drop apothogems ;</l>
     <l n="109">The woman who drinks with you will be yours ;</l>
     <l n="110">Or she who gives herself to you will give</l>
     <l n="111">To someone else ; you know the kind of talk ?</l>
     <l n="112">Where wisdom of the sort is averaged up ,</l>
     <l n="113">But misses finer instances , the beauties</l>
     <l n="114">Among the million phases of the thing .</l>
     <l n="115">And , so at last I thought the girl was game .</l>

     <l n="118">We were out riding on a summer 's night ,</l>
     <l n="119">A moon and all the rest , the scent of flowers ,</l>
     <l n="120">And many kisses , as on other times .</l>
     <l n="121">At last with this sole object in my mind</l>
     <l n="122">Long concentrated , purposed , all at once</l>
     <l n="123">I found myself turned violent , with hands</l>
     <l n="124">At grapple , twisting , forcing , and this girl</l>
     <l n="125">In terror pleading with me . In a moment</l>
     <l n="126">When I took time for breath , she said to me :</l>
     <l n="127">‘ I will not ride with you — you let me out . ’</l>
     <l n="128">To which I said : ‘ You 'll do what I desire</l>

     <l n="130">And find Roy Green , you like him better , maybe . ’</l>
     <l n="131">And she said : ‘ Let me out , ’ and she jumped out ,</l>
     <l n="132">And would not ride with me another step ,</l>
     <l n="133">Though I repented saying , come and ride .</l>
     <l n="134">I think it was a mile or more I drove</l>

     <l n="137">And left her walking , looked from time to time</l>
     <l n="138">To see her in the roadway , then drove on</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Bill , look here ! Here 's the Times . You see this picture ,</l>
     <l n="2">Read if you like a little later . You never</l>
     <l n="3">Heard how I came to Fairbanks , chanced to stay .</l>
     <l n="4">It 's eight years now . You see in nineteen eleven</l>
     <l n="5">I lived in Hammond , Indiana , thought</l>
     <l n="6">I 'd like a trip , see mountains , see Alaska ,</l>
     <l n="7">Perhaps find fortune or a woman — well</l>
     <l n="8">You know from your experience how it is .</l>
     <l n="9">It was July and from the train I saw</l>
     <l n="10">The Canadian Rockies , stopped at Banff a day ,</l>
     <l n="11">At Lake Louise , and so forth . At Vancouver</l>
     <l n="12">Found travelers feasting , Englishmen in drink ,</l>
     <l n="13">Flirtations budding , coming into flower ;</l>
     <l n="14">And eager spirits waiting for the boat .</l>
     <l n="15">Up to this time I had n't made a friend ,</l>
     <l n="16">Stalked silently about along the streets ,</l>
     <l n="17">Drank Scotch like all the rest , as much besides .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="18">Well , then we took the steamship Princess Alice</l>
     <l n="19">And started up the Inland Channel — great !</l>
     <l n="20">Got on our cheeks the breezes from the crystal</l>
     <l n="21">Cradles of the north , began at once</l>
     <l n="22">To find the mystery , silence , see clear stars ,</l>
     <l n="23">The whites and blacks and greens along the shores .</l>
     <l n="24">And still I had no friend , was quite alone .</l>
     <l n="25">Just as I came on deck I saw a face ,</l>
     <l n="26">Looked , stared perhaps . Her eyes went over me ,</l>
     <l n="27">Would not look at me . At the dinner table</l>
     <l n="28">She sat far down from me , I could not see her ,</l>
     <l n="29">But made a point to rise when she arose ,</l>
     <l n="30">Did all I could to catch her eye — no use .</l>
     <l n="31">So things went and I gave up — still I wondered</l>
     <l n="32">Why she had no companion . Was she married ?</l>
     <l n="33">Was husband waiting her , at Skagway ?— well</l>
     <l n="34">I fancied something of the sort , at last ,</l>
     <l n="35">And as I said , gave up .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="36">But on a morning</l>
     <l n="37">I rose to see the sun rise , all the sky</l>
     <l n="38">First as a giant pansy , petals flung</l>
     <l n="39">In violet toward the zenith streaked with fire ;</l>
     <l n="40">The silver of the snows change under light ,</l>
     <l n="41">Mottled with shadows of the mountain tops</l>
     <l n="42">Like leaves that shadow , flutter on a lawn .</l>
     <l n="43">At last the topaz splendors shoot to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="44">The sun just peeks and gilds the porcelain</l>
     <l n="45">Of snow with purest gold . And in the valleys</l>
     <l n="46">Darkness remains , Orician ebony</l>
     <l n="47">Is not more black . You 've seen this too , I know ,</l>
     <l n="48">And recognize my picture . There I stood ,</l>
     <l n="49">Believed I was alone , then heard a voice ,</l>
     <l n="50">“ Is it not beautiful ? ” and looked around ,</l>
     <l n="51">And saw my girl , who had avoided me ,</l>
     <l n="52">Would not make friends before . This is her picture ,</l>
     <l n="53">Name , Elenor Murray . So the matter started .</l>
     <l n="54">I had my seat at table changed and sat</l>
     <l n="55">Next to my girl to talk with her . We walked</l>
     <l n="56">The deck together . Then she said to me</l>
     <l n="57">Her home was in Chicago , so it is</l>
     <l n="58">Travelers abroad discover they are neighbors</l>
     <l n="59">When they are home . She had been teaching school ,</l>
     <l n="60">And saved her money for this trip , had planned</l>
     <l n="61">To go as far as Fairbanks . As for me ,</l>
     <l n="62">I thought I 'd stop with Skagway — Oh this life !</l>
     <l n="63">Your hat blows off , you chase it , bump a woman ,</l>
     <l n="64">Then beg her pardon , laugh and get acquainted ,</l>
     <l n="65">And marry later .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="66">As we steamed along</l>
     <l n="67">She was the happiest spirit on the deck .</l>
     <l n="68">The Wrangell Narrows almost drove her wild ,</l>
     <l n="69">There where the mountains are like circus tents ,</l>
     <l n="70">Big show , menagerie and all the rest ,</l>
     <l n="71">But white as cotton with perennial snow .</l>
     <l n="72">We swum past aisles of pine trees where a stream</l>
     <l n="73">Rushed down in terraces of hoary foam .</l>
     <l n="74">The nights were glorious . We drank and ate</l>
     <l n="75">And danced when there was dancing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="76">Well , at first ,</l>
     <l n="77">She seemed a little school ma'am , quaint , demure ,</l>
     <l n="78">Meticulous and puritanical .</l>
     <l n="79">And then she seemed a school ma'am out to have</l>
     <l n="80">A time , so far away , where none would know ,</l>
     <l n="81">And like a woman who had heard of life</l>
     <l n="82">And had a teasing interest in its wonder ,</l>
     <l n="83">Too long caged up . At last my vision blurred :</l>
     <l n="84">I did not know her , lost my first impressions</l>
     <l n="85">Amid succeeding phases which she showed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="86">But when we came to Skagway , then I saw</l>
     <l n="87">Another Elenor Murray . How she danced</l>
     <l n="88">And tripped from place to place — such energy !</l>
     <l n="89">She almost wore me out with seeing sights .</l>
     <l n="90">But now behold ! The White Pass she must see</l>
     <l n="91">Upon the principle of missing nothing —</l>
     <l n="92">But oh the grave of “ Soapy ” Smith , the outlaw ,</l>
     <l n="93">The gambler and the heeler , that for her !</l>
     <l n="94">We went four miles and found the cemetery ,</l>
     <l n="95">The grave of “ Soapy ” Smith .— Came back to town</l>
     <l n="96">Where she would see the buildings where they played</l>
     <l n="97">Stud poker , Keno , in the riotous days .</l>
     <l n="98">Time came for her to go . She looked at me</l>
     <l n="99">And said “ Come on to Fairbanks . ” As for that ,</l>
     <l n="100">I 'd had enough , was ready to return ,</l>
     <l n="101">But sensed an honorarium , so I said ,</l>
     <l n="102">“ You might induce me , ” with a pregnant tone .</l>
     <l n="103">That moment we were walking ‘ cross the street ,</l>
     <l n="104">She stopped a moment , shook from head to heels ,</l>
     <l n="105">And said , “ No man has talked to me that way . ”</l>
     <l n="106">I dropped the matter . She renewed it — said ,</l>
     <l n="107">“ Why do you hurry back ? What calls you back ?</l>
     <l n="108">Come on to Fairbanks , see the gardens there ,</l>
     <l n="109">That tag the blizzards with their rosy hands</l>
     <l n="110">And romp amid the snows . ” She smiled at me .</l>
     <l n="111">Well , then I thought — why not ? And smiled her back ,</l>
     <l n="112">And on we went to Fairbanks , where my hat</l>
     <l n="113">Blows off , as I shall tell you .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="114">For a day</l>
     <l n="115">We did the town together , and that night</l>
     <l n="116">I thought to win her . First we dined together ,</l>
     <l n="117">Had many drinks , my little school ma'am drank</l>
     <l n="118">Of everything I ordered , had a place</l>
     <l n="119">For more than I could drink . And truth to tell</l>
     <l n="120">At bed time I was woozy , ten o'clock .</l>
     <l n="121">We had not registered . And so I said ,</l>
     <l n="122">“ I 'm Mr. Kelly and you 're Mrs. Kelly . ”</l>
     <l n="123">She shook her head . And so to make an end</l>
     <l n="124">I could not win her , signed my name in full ;</l>
     <l n="125">She did the same , we said good night and parted .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="126">Next morning when I woke , felt none too good ,</l>
     <l n="127">Got up at last and met her down at breakfast ;</l>
     <l n="128">Tried eggs and toast , could only drink some coffee ;</l>
     <l n="129">Got worse ; in short , she saw it , put her hand</l>
     <l n="130">Upon my head and said , “ Your head is hot ,</l>
     <l n="131">You have a fever . ” Well , I lolled around</l>
     <l n="132">And tried to fight it off till noon — no good .</l>
     <l n="133">By this time I was sick , lay down to rest .</l>
     <l n="134">By night I could not lift my head — in short ,</l>
     <l n="135">I lay there for a month , and all the time</l>
     <l n="136">She cared for me just like a mother would .</l>
     <l n="137">They moved me to a suite , she took the room</l>
     <l n="138">That opened into mine , by night and day</l>
     <l n="139">She nursed me , cheered me , read to me . At last</l>
     <l n="140">When I sat up , was soon to be about ,</l>
     <l n="141">She said to me , “ I 'm going on to Nome ,</l>
     <l n="142">St. Michael first . They tell me that you cross</l>
     <l n="143">The Arctic Circle going to St. Michael ,</l>
     <l n="144">And I must cross the Arctic Circle — think</l>
     <l n="145">To come this far and miss it . I must see</l>
     <l n="146">The Indian villages . ” And there again</l>
     <l n="147">I saw , but clearer than before , the spirit</l>
     <l n="148">Adventuresome and restless , what you call</l>
     <l n="149">The heart American . I said to her ,</l>
     <l n="150">“ I 'm not too well , I 'm lonely ,— yes , and more —</l>
     <l n="151">I 'm fond of you , you have been good to me ,</l>
     <l n="152">Stay with me here .— She darted in and out</l>
     <l n="153">The room where I was lying , doing things ,</l>
     <l n="154">And broke my pleadings just like icicles</l>
     <l n="155">You shoot against a wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="156">But here she was ,</l>
     <l n="157">A month in Fairbanks , living at expense ,</l>
     <l n="158">Said “ I am short of money — lend me some ,</l>
     <l n="159">I 'll go to Nome , return to you and then</l>
     <l n="160">We 'll ship together for the States . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="161">You see</l>
     <l n="162">I really owed her money for her care ,</l>
     <l n="163">Her loss in staying — then I loved the girl ,</l>
     <l n="164">Had played all cards but one — I played it now :</l>
     <l n="165">“ Come back and marry me . ” Her eyes looked down .</l>
     <l n="166">“ I will be fair with you , ” she said , “ and think .</l>
     <l n="167">Away from you I can make up my mind</l>
     <l n="168">If I have love enough to marry you . ”</l>
     <l n="169">I gave her money and she went away ,</l>
     <l n="170">And for some weeks I had a splendid hell</l>
     <l n="171">Of loneliness and longing , you might know ,</l>
     <l n="172">A stranger in Alaska , here in Fairbanks ,</l>
     <l n="173">In love besides , and mulling in my mind</l>

     <l n="176">Weeks went by ,</l>
     <l n="177">No letter and no girl . I found my health</l>

     <l n="179">I kicked a twenty dollar gold piece up</l>
     <l n="180">Right on the side-walk . Picked it up and said :</l>
     <l n="181">“ An omen of good luck , a letter soon !</l>
     <l n="182">Perhaps this town has something for me ! ” Well ,</l>
     <l n="183">I thought I 'd get a job to pass the time</l>
     <l n="184">While waiting for my girl . I got the job</l>
     <l n="185">And here I am to-day ; I 've flourished here ,</l>

     <l n="194">In asking her in marriage , but had thought</l>
     <l n="195">The matter over , could not marry me ,</l>

     <l n="198">Now , Bill , I 'm egotist enough to think</l>

     <l n="201">Why did she ditch me ? So I thought about it ,</l>
     <l n="202">Was piqued of course , concluded in the end</l>

     <l n="204">Means she has someone else , expects to have ,</l>
     <l n="205">More suited to her fancy . Then one morning</l>
     <l n="206">As I awoke with thoughts of her as usual</l>
     <l n="207">Right in my mind there plumped an incident</l>
     <l n="208">On shipboard when she asked me if I knew</l>

     <l n="213">A certain man , the chances are the man</l>
     <l n="214">Is something in her life . So now I lay</l>
     <l n="215">And thought there is a man , and that 's the man ;</l>
     <l n="216">His name is stored away , I 'll dig it up</l>

    <head>ANTON SOSNOWSKI</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Anton Sosnowski , from the Shakspeare School</l>
     <l n="2">Where he assists the janitor , sweeps and dusts ,</l>
     <l n="3">The day now done , sits by a smeared up table</l>
     <l n="4">Munching coarse bread and drinking beer ; before him</l>
     <l n="5">The evening paper spread , held down or turned</l>
     <l n="6">By claw-like hands , covered with shiny scars .</l>
     <l n="7">He broods upon the war news , and his fate</l>
     <l n="8">Which keeps him from the war , looks up and sees</l>
     <l n="9">His scarred face in the mirror over the wainscot ;</l>
     <l n="10">His lashless eyes and browless brows and head</l>
     <l n="11">With patches of thin hair . And then he mutters</l>
     <l n="12">Hot curses to himself and turns the paper</l>
     <l n="13">And curses Germany , and asks revenge</l>
     <l n="14">For Poland 's wrongs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">And what is this he sees ?</l>
     <l n="16">The picture of his ruin and his hate ,</l>
     <l n="17">Wert Rufus Fox ! This leader of the bar</l>
     <l n="18">Is made the counselor of the city , now</l>
     <l n="19">The city takes gas , cars and telephones</l>
     <l n="20">And runs them for the people . So this man</l>
     <l n="21">Grown rich through machinations against the people ,</l>
     <l n="22">Who fought the people all his life before ,</l>
     <l n="23">Abettor , aider , thinker for the slickers</l>
     <l n="24">Regraters and forestallers and engrossers ,</l>
     <l n="25">Is now the friend , adviser of the city ,</l>
     <l n="26">Which he so balked and thwarted , growing rich ,</l>
     <l n="27">Feared , noted , bowed to for the very treason</l>
     <l n="28">For which he is so hated , yet deferred to .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">And Anton looks upon the picture , reads</l>
     <l n="30">About the great man 's ancestry here printed ,</l>
     <l n="31">And all the great achievements of his life ;</l>
     <l n="32">Once president of the bar association ,</l>
     <l n="33">And member of this club and of that club .</l>
     <l n="34">Contributor to charities and art ,</l>
     <l n="35">A founder of a library , a vestryman .</l>
     <l n="36">And Anton looks upon the picture , trembles</l>
     <l n="37">Before the picture 's eyes . They are the eyes</l>
     <l n="38">Of Innocent the Tenth , with cruelty</l>
     <l n="39">And cunning added — eyes that see all things</l>
     <l n="40">And boulder jaws that crush all things — the jaws</l>
     <l n="41">That place themselves at front of drifts , are placed</l>
     <l n="42">By that world irony which mocks the good ,</l>
     <l n="43">And gives the glory and the victory</l>
     <l n="44">To strength and greed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="45">Anton Sosnowski looks</l>
     <l n="46">Long at the picture , then at his own hands ,</l>
     <l n="47">And laughs maniacally as he takes the mug</l>
     <l n="48">With both hands like a bird with frozen claws ,</l>
     <l n="49">These broken , burned off hands which handle bread</l>
     <l n="50">As they were wooden rakes . And in a mirror</l>
     <l n="51">Beside the table in the wall , smeared over</l>
     <l n="52">With steam from red-hots , kraut and cookery ,</l>
     <l n="53">Of smoking fats , fixed by the dust in blurs ,</l>
     <l n="54">And streaks , he sees his own face , horrible</l>
     <l n="55">For scars and splotches as of leprosy ;</l>
     <l n="56">The eyes that have no lashes and no brows ;</l>
     <l n="57">The bullet head that has no hair , the ears</l>
     <l n="58">Burnt off at top .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="59">So comes it to this Pole</l>
     <l n="60">Who sees beside the picture of the lawyer</l>
     <l n="61">The clear cut face of Elenor Murray — yes ,</l>
     <l n="62">She gave her spirit to the war , is dead ,</l>
     <l n="63">Her life is being sifted now . But Fox</l>
     <l n="64">Lives for more honors , and by honors covers</l>
     <l n="65">His days of evil .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="66">Thus Sosnowski broods ,</l>
     <l n="67">And lives again that moment of hell when fire</l>
     <l n="68">Burst like a geyser from a vat where gas</l>
     <l n="69">Had gathered in his ignorance ; being sent</l>
     <l n="70">To light a drying stove within the vat ,</l>
     <l n="71">A work not his , who was the engineer .</l>
     <l n="72">The gas exploded as he struck the match ,</l>
     <l n="73">And like an insect fixed upon a pin</l>
     <l n="74">And held before a flame , hands , face and body</l>
     <l n="75">Were burned and broken as his body shot</l>
     <l n="76">Up and against the brewery wall . What next ?</l>
     <l n="77">The wearisome and tangled ways of courts</l>
     <l n="78">With Rufus Fox for foe , four trials in all</l>
     <l n="79">Where juries disagreed who heard the law</l>
     <l n="80">Erroneously given by the court .</l>
     <l n="81">At last a verdict favorable , and a court</l>
     <l n="82">Sitting above the forum where he won</l>
     <l n="83">To say , as there 's no evidence to show</l>
     <l n="84">Just how the gas got in the vat , Sosnowski</l>
     <l n="85">Must go for life with broken hands unhelped .</l>
     <l n="86">And that the fact alone of gas therein</l>
     <l n="87">Though naught to show his fault had brought it there ,</l>
     <l n="88">The mere explosion did not speak a fault</l>
     <l n="89">Against the brewery .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="90">Out from court he went</l>
     <l n="91">To use a broom with crumpled hands , and look</l>
     <l n="92">For life in mirrors at his ghastly face .</l>
     <l n="93">And brood until suspicion grew to truth</l>
     <l n="94">That Rufus Fox had compassed juries , courts ;</l>
     <l n="95">And read of Rufus Fox , who day by day</l>
     <l n="96">Was featured in the press for noble deeds ,</l>
     <l n="97">For Art or Charity , for notable dinners ,</l>
     <l n="98">Guests , travels and what not .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="99">So now the Pole</l>
     <l n="100">Reading of Elenor Murray , cursed himself</l>
     <l n="101">That he could brood and wait — for what ?— and grow</l>
     <l n="102">More weak of will for brooding , while this woman</l>
     <l n="103">Had gone to war and served and ended it ,</l>
     <l n="104">Yet he lived on , and could not go to war ;</l>
     <l n="105">Saw only days of sweeping with these hands ,</l>
     <l n="106">And every day his face within the mirror ,</l>
     <l n="107">And every afternoon this glass of beer ,</l>
     <l n="108">And coarse bread , and these thoughts .</l>
     <l n="109">And every day some story to arouse</l>
     <l n="110">His sense of justice ; how the generous</l>
     <l n="111">Give and pass on , and how the selfish live</l>
     <l n="112">And gather honors . But Sosnowski thought</l>
     <l n="113">If I could do a flaming thing to show</l>
     <l n="114">What courts are ours , what matter if I die ?</l>
     <l n="115">What if they took their quick-lime and erased</l>
     <l n="116">My flesh and bones , expunged my very name ,</l>
     <l n="117">And made its syllables forbidden ?— still</l>
     <l n="118">If I brought in a new day for the courts ,</l>
     <l n="119">Have I not served ? he thought . Sosnowski rose</l>
     <l n="120">And to the bar , drank whiskey , then went out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="121">That afternoon Elihu Rufus Fox</l>
     <l n="122">Came home to dress for a dinner to be given</l>
     <l n="123">For English notables in town — to rest</l>
     <l n="124">After a bath , and found himself alone ,</l>
     <l n="125">His wife at Red Cross work . And there alone ,</l>
     <l n="126">Collarless , lounging , in a comfort chair ,</l>
     <l n="127">Poring on Wordsworth 's poems — all at once</l>
     <l n="128">Before he hears the door turned , rather feels</l>
     <l n="129">A foot-fall and a presence , hears too soon</l>
     <l n="130">A pistol shot , looks up and sees Sosnowski ,</l>
     <l n="131">Who fires again , but misses ; grabs the man ,</l>
     <l n="132">Disarms him , flings him down , and finding blood</l>
     <l n="133">Upon his shirt sleeve , sees his hand is hit ,</l>
     <l n="134">No other damage — then the pistol takes ,</l>
     <l n="135">And covering Sosnowski , looks at him .</l>
     <l n="136">And after several seconds gets the face</l>
     <l n="137">Which gradually comes forth from memories</l>
     <l n="138">Of many cases , knows the man at last .</l>
     <l n="139">And studying Sosnowski , Rufus Fox</l>
     <l n="140">Divines what drove the fellow to this deed .</l>
     <l n="141">And in these moments Rufus Fox beholds</l>
     <l n="142">His life and work , and how he made the law</l>
     <l n="143">A thing to use , how he had builded friendships</l>
     <l n="144">In clubs and churches , courted politicians ,</l>
     <l n="145">And played with secret powers , and compromised</l>
     <l n="146">Causes and truths for power and capital</l>
     <l n="147">To draw on as a lawyer , so to win</l>
     <l n="148">Favorable judgments when his skill was hired</l>
     <l n="149">By those who wished to win , who had to win</l>
     <l n="150">To keep the social order undisturbed</l>
     <l n="151">And wealth where it was wrenched to .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="152">And Rufus Fox</l>
     <l n="153">Knew that this trembling wreck before him knew</l>
     <l n="154">About this course of life at making law</l>
     <l n="155">And using law , and using those who sit</l>
     <l n="156">To administer the law . And then he said :</l>
     <l n="157">“ Why did you do this ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="158">And Sosnowski spoke :</l>
     <l n="159">“ I meant to kill you — where 's your right to live</l>
     <l n="160">When millions have been killed to make the world</l>
     <l n="161">A safer place for liberty ? Where 's your right</l>
     <l n="162">To live and have more honors , be the man</l>
     <l n="163">To guide the city , now that telephones ,</l>
     <l n="164">Gas , railways have been taken by the city ?</l>
     <l n="165">I meant to kill you just to help the poor</l>
     <l n="166">Who go to court . For had I killed you here</l>
     <l n="167">My story would be known , no matter if</l>
     <l n="168">They buried me in lime , and made my name</l>
     <l n="169">A word no man could speak . Now I have failed .</l>
     <l n="170">And since you have the pistol , point it at me</l>
     <l n="171">And kill me now — for if you tell the world</l>
     <l n="172">You killed me in defense of self , the world</l>
     <l n="173">Will never doubt you , for the world believes you</l>
     <l n="174">And will not doubt your word , whatever it is . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="175">And Rufus Fox replied : “ Your mind is turned</l>
     <l n="176">For thinking of your case , when you should know</l>

     <l n="179">Now I must turn you over to the courts ,</l>
     <l n="180">And let you feel the hard hand of the law . ”</l>
     <l n="181">Just then the wife of Rufus Fox came in ,</l>
     <l n="182">And saw her husband with his granite jaws ,</l>
     <l n="183">And lowering countenance , blood on his shirt ,</l>
     <l n="184">The pistol in his hand , the scarred Sosnowski ,</l>
     <l n="185">Facing the lawyer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="186">Seeing that her husband</l>
     <l n="187">Had no wound but a hand clipped of the skin ,</l>
     <l n="188">And learning what the story was , she saw</l>
     <l n="189">It was no time to let Sosnowski 's wrong</l>
     <l n="190">Come out to cloud the glory of her husband ,</l>
     <l n="191">Now that in a new day he had come to stand</l>

     <l n="193">The corpse of a dead day be brought beside</l>
     <l n="194">The fresh and breathing life of brighter truth .</l>
     <l n="195">Quickly she called the butler , gave him charge</l>
     <l n="196">Over Sosnowski , who was taken out ,</l>
     <l n="197">Held in the kitchen , while the two conferred ,</l>
     <l n="198">The husband and the wife .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="199">To him she said ,</l>
     <l n="200">They two alone now : “ I can see your plan</l>

     <l n="202">It will not do , my dear , it will not do .</l>
     <l n="203">For though I have been sharer in your life ,</l>
     <l n="204">Partaker of its spoils and fruits , I see</l>
     <l n="205">This man is just a ghost of a dead day</l>
     <l n="206">Of your past life , perhaps , in which I shared .</l>
     <l n="207">But that dead life I would not resurrect</l>
     <l n="208">In memory even , it has passed us by ,</l>
     <l n="209">You shall not live it more , no more shall I .</l>
     <l n="210">The war has changed the world — the harvest coming</l>
     <l n="211">Will have its tares no doubt , but the old tares</l>
     <l n="212">Have been cut out and burned , wholly , I trust .</l>
     <l n="213">And just to think you used that sharpened talent</l>
     <l n="214">For getting money , place , in the old regime ,</l>
     <l n="215">To place you where to-day ? Why , where you must</l>
     <l n="216">Use all your talents for the common good .</l>
     <l n="217">A barter takes two parties , and the traffic</l>

     <l n="219">( You are a giant rising on the wreck</l>

     <l n="233">Your labors brought me . All is changed for me .</l>
     <l n="234">I would be poorer than this wretched Pole</l>

     <l n="249">Wronged this poor Pole , make good the wrong at once .</l>
     <l n="250">And for the sake of bigness let him go .</l>
     <l n="251">For your own name 's sake , let the fellow go .</l>

     <l n="5">And in these thirty years these houses here ,</l>
     <l n="6">Here , all around here have been built . This lot</l>

     <l n="12">Was I first rate lawyer ? Well , I won</l>

     <l n="26">Bound it with limitation for the life</l>

     <l n="28">Who keeps a cow upon it . There 's the cow !</l>
     <l n="29">The land has had no use for thirty years .</l>
     <l n="30">The children are kept off it . Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="31">This girl whose death makes such a stir , one time</l>
     <l n="32">Was playing there — but that 's another story .</l>
     <l n="33">I only say for the present , these five acres</l>
     <l n="34">Made Elenor Murray 's life a thing of waste</l>
     <l n="35">As much as anything , and a damn sight more .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">Kingston had a daughter</l>
     <l n="38">Married to Colonel Burton in Kentucky .</l>
     <l n="39">And Kingston 's son was in the Civil War .</l>
     <l n="40">But just before the war , the Burtons deeded</l>
     <l n="41">These acres here , which she inherited</l>
     <l n="42">From old man Kingston , to this Captain Kingston ,</l>
     <l n="43">The son aforesaid of Old Kingston . Well ,</l>
     <l n="44">The deed upon its face was absolute ,</l>
     <l n="45">But really was a deed in trust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="46">The Captain</l>
     <l n="47">Held title for a year or two , and then</l>
     <l n="48">An hour before he fought at Shiloh , made</l>
     <l n="49">A will , and willed acres to his wife ,</l>
     <l n="50">Fee simple and forever . Now you 'd think</l>
     <l n="51">That contemplating death , he 'd make a deed</l>
     <l n="52">Giving these acres back to Mrs. Burton ,</l>
     <l n="53">The sister who had trusted him . I do n't know</l>
     <l n="54">What comes in people 's heads , but I believe</l>
     <l n="55">The want of money is the root of evil ,</l>
     <l n="56">As well as love of money ; for this Captain</l>
     <l n="57">Perhaps would make provision for his wife</l>
     <l n="58">And infant son , thought that the chiefest thing</l>
     <l n="59">No matter how he did it , being poor ,</l>
     <l n="60">Willed this land as he did . But anyway</l>
     <l n="61">He willed it so , went into Shiloh 's battle ,</l>
     <l n="62">And fell dead on the field .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">What happened then ?</l>
     <l n="64">They took this will to probate . As I said</l>
     <l n="65">I was a lawyer then , you may believe it ,</l>
     <l n="66">Was hired by the Burtons to reclaim</l>
     <l n="67">These acres from the Widow Kingston 's clutch ,</l>
     <l n="68">Under this wicked will . And so I argued</l>
     <l n="69">The will had not been witnessed according to law .</l>
     <l n="70">Got beat upon that point in the lower court ,</l>
     <l n="71">But won upon it in the upper courts .</l>
     <l n="72">Then next I filed a bill to set aside</l>
     <l n="73">This deed the Burtons made to Captain Kingston —</l>
     <l n="74">Oh , I was full of schemes , expedients ,</l>
     <l n="75">In those days , I can tell you . Widow Kingston</l>
     <l n="76">Came back and filed a cross bill , asked the court</l>
     <l n="77">To confirm the title in her son and her</l>
     <l n="78">As heirs of Captain Kingston , let the will</l>
     <l n="79">Go out of thought and reckoning . Here 's the issue ;</l>
     <l n="80">You understand the case , no doubt . We fought</l>
     <l n="81">Through all the courts . I lost in the lower court ,</l>
     <l n="82">As I lost on the will . There was the deed :</l>
     <l n="83">For love and affection and one dollar we</l>
     <l n="84">Convey and warrant lots from one to ten</l>
     <l n="85">In the city of LeRoy , to Captain Kingston</l>

     <l n="87">How to go</l>
     <l n="88">Behind such words and show the actual trust</l>
     <l n="89">Inhering in the deed , that was the job .</l>
     <l n="90">But here I was resourceful as before ,</l>
     <l n="91">Found witnesses to testify they heard</l>
     <l n="92">This Captain Kingston say he held the acres</l>

     <l n="99">I quit the business when I saw the business</l>

     <l n="157">When school was out , a sunny afternoon .</l>
     <l n="158">The children had no place except the street</l>
     <l n="159">To play in ; they were standing by the fence ,</l>
     <l n="160">The cow was way across the lot , and Elenor</l>

     <l n="175">Then I heard “ hey ! ” the care-taker ran out .</l>
     <l n="176">And said “ Get out of there , I will arrest you . ”</l>

     <l n="180">And then the care-taker grabbed Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="181">And said , “ You are the wildest of them all . ”</l>
     <l n="182">I spoke up , saying , “ Leave that child alone .</l>

     <l n="2">Whom does it look like ? Eyes too crystalline ,</l>
     <l n="3">A head like Byron 's , tender mouth , and neck ,</l>
     <l n="4">Slender and white , a pathos as of smiles</l>
     <l n="5">And tears kept back by courage . Yes , you know</l>

     <l n="19">My mind through Europe and America</l>
     <l n="20">In all my travels , meetings , episodes .</l>

     <l n="37">And everyone has something in his life</l>
     <l n="38">Which takes him , makes him , is the image too</l>

     <l n="46">And as she wrote of self , a vagabond ,</l>
     <l n="47">A dweller in tents , a reveler , and a flame</l>
     <l n="48">Aspiring but disreputable , coming up</l>
     <l n="49">With leaves that shamed her stalk , could not be shed ,</l>
     <l n="50">But stuck out heavy veined and muddy hued</l>
     <l n="51">In time of blossom . There are souls , you know ,</l>
     <l n="52">Who have shed shapeless immaturities ,</l>
     <l n="53">Betrayals of the seed before the blossom</l>
     <l n="54">Comes to proclaim a beauty , a perfection ;</l>
     <l n="55">Or risen with their stalk , until such leaves</l>

     <l n="57">Nor even your Elenor Murray , as I read her .</l>
     <l n="58">But being America and American ,</l>
     <l n="59">Brings good and bad together , blossom and leaves</l>
     <l n="60">With prodigal recklessness , in vital health</l>

     <l n="66">And puts her in the ballet at New Orleans .</l>
     <l n="67">She dances then from Texas clear to Cuba ;</l>
     <l n="68">Then gives up dancing , studies tragedy ,</l>
     <l n="69">And plays Bianca ! Fourteen years of age</l>
     <l n="70">Weds Menken , who 's a Jew , divorced from him ;</l>
     <l n="71">Then falls in love with Heenan , pugilist .</l>
     <l n="72">They quarrel and separate — it 's in this pamphlet</l>
     <l n="73">Just as I tell you ; you can take it , Coroner .</l>
     <l n="74">Now something happens , nothing in her birth</l>
     <l n="75">Or place of birth to prophesy her life</l>
     <l n="76">Like Starved Rock to this Elenor — being grown ,</l>
     <l n="77">A hand instead is darted from the curtain</l>
     <l n="78">That hangs between to-day , to-morrow , sticks</l>
     <l n="79">A symbol on her heart and whispers to her :</l>
     <l n="80">You 're this , my woman . Well , the thing was this :</l>
     <l n="81">She played Mazeppa : take your dummy off ,</l>
     <l n="82">And lash me to the horse . They were afraid ,</l>
     <l n="83">But she prevailed , was nearly killed the first night ,</l>
     <l n="84">And after that succeeded , was the rage</l>
     <l n="85">And for her years remaining found herself</l>
     <l n="86">Lashed to the wild horse of ungoverned will ,</l>

     <l n="4">Give men and women freedom , save the land</l>
     <l n="5">From dull theocracy — the theo , what ?</l>
     <l n="6">A blend of Demos and Jehovah ! Say ,</l>
     <l n="7">Bring back your despots , bring your Louis Fourteenths ,</l>
     <l n="8">And give them thrones of gold and ivory</l>
     <l n="9">From where with leaded sceptres they may whack</l>
     <l n="10">King Demos driven forth . You know the face ?</l>
     <l n="11">The temples are like sea shells , hollows out ,</l>
     <l n="12">Which narrow close the space for cortex cells .</l>
     <l n="13">There would be little brow if hair remained ;</l>
     <l n="14">But hair is gone , because the dandruff came .</l>
     <l n="15">The eyes are close together like a weasel 's ;</l>
     <l n="16">The jaws are heavy , that is character ;</l>
     <l n="17">The mouth is thin and wide to gobble chicken ;</l>
     <l n="18">The paunch is heavy for the chickens eaten .</l>
     <l n="19">Throned high upon a soap box Demos rules ,</l>
     <l n="20">And mumbles decalogues : Thou shalt not read ,</l>
     <l n="21">Save what I tell you , never books that tell</l>
     <l n="22">Of men and women as they live and are .</l>
     <l n="23">Thou shalt not see the dramas which portray</l>
     <l n="24">The evil passions and satiric moods</l>
     <l n="25">Which mock this Christian nation and its hope .</l>
     <l n="26">Thou shalt not drink , not even wine or beer .</l>
     <l n="27">Thou shalt not play at cards , or see the races .</l>
     <l n="28">Thou shalt not be divorced ! Thou shalt not play .</l>
     <l n="29">Thou shalt not bow to graven images</l>
     <l n="30">Of beauty cut in marble , fused in bronze .</l>
     <l n="31">Behold my name is Demos , King of Kings ,</l>
     <l n="32">My name is legion , I am many , come</l>
     <l n="33">Out of the sea where many hogs were drowned ,</l>
     <l n="34">And now the ruler of hogocracy ,</l>
     <l n="35">Where in the name of freedom hungry snouts</l>
     <l n="36">Root up the truffles in your great republic ,</l>
     <l n="37">And crunch with heavy jaws the legs and arms</l>
     <l n="38">Of people who fall over in the pen .</l>
     <l n="39">Hierarchies in my name are planted under</l>
     <l n="40">Your states political to sprout and take</l>
     <l n="41">The new world 's soil ,— religious freedom this !—</l>
     <l n="42">Thought must be free — unless your thought objects</l>
     <l n="43">To such dominion , and to literal faith</l>
     <l n="44">In an old book that never had a place</l>

     <l n="50">Or kindle spirit with a rapture save</l>
     <l n="51">A moral end 's in view . All joy is sin ,</l>
     <l n="52">Where joy stands for itself alone , nor asks</l>
     <l n="53">Consent to be , save for itself . But war</l>
     <l n="54">Waged to put down the wrong , it 's always that ;</l>
     <l n="55">To vindicate God 's truths , all wars are such ,</l>
     <l n="56">Is game that lets the spirit play , is backed</l>
     <l n="57">By God and moral reasons , therefore war ,</l>
     <l n="58">A game disguised as business , cosmic work</l>
     <l n="59">For great millenniums , no less relieves</l>
     <l n="60">The boredom of theocracies . But if</l>
     <l n="61">Your men and women had the chance to play ,</l>
     <l n="62">Be free and spend superfluous energies ,</l>

     <l n="69">The Greeks beheld the Persians . Well , behold</l>
     <l n="70">All honest paganism in such things discarded</l>

     <l n="104">The game is not so funny as it was .</l>
     <l n="105">That 's why I hated Germany and hate her ,</l>
     <l n="106">And feel we could not let this German culture</l>
     <l n="107">Spread over earth . That culture was but this :</l>
     <l n="108">Life must have an expression and a game ,</l>
     <l n="109">And war 's the game , besides the prize is great</l>
     <l n="110">In land and treasure , commerce , let us play ,</l>
     <l n="111">It lets the people 's passions have a vent</l>
     <l n="112">When fires of life burn hot and hotter under</l>
     <l n="113">The kettle and the lid is clamped by work ,</l>
     <l n="114">Dull duty , daily routine , inhibitions .</l>
     <l n="115">Before this Elenor Murray woke to life</l>
     <l n="116">LeRoy was stirring , but the stir was play .</l>
     <l n="117">It was a Gretna Green , and pleasure boats</l>
     <l n="118">Ran up and down the river — on the streets</l>
     <l n="119">You heard the cry of barkers , in the park</l>
     <l n="120">The band was playing , and you heard the ring</l>
     <l n="121">Of registers at fountains and buffets .</l>
     <l n="122">All this was shabby maybe , but observe</l>
     <l n="123">There are those souls who see the wrath of God</l>
     <l n="124">As blackest background to the light of soul :</l>
     <l n="125">And when the thunder rumbles and the storm</l>
     <l n="126">Comes up with lightning then they say to men</l>
     <l n="127">Who laugh in bar-rooms , “ Have a care , blasphemers ,</l>
     <l n="128">You may be struck by lightning ” — here 's the root</l>
     <l n="129">From which this mood ascetic comes to leaf</l>
     <l n="130">In all theocracies , and throws a shadow</l>
     <l n="131">Upon all freedom .</l>

     <l n="150">Than health is needful , he must have a way</l>
     <l n="151">To voice the life within him , and he wonders</l>

     <l n="3">That is the world , and Jack is God , you know ;</l>
     <l n="4">The malt is linen , purple , wine and food ,</l>
     <l n="5">The rats that get the malt are nobles , lords ,</l>
     <l n="6">Those who had feudal dues and hunting rights ,</l>
     <l n="7">And privileges , first nights , all the rest .</l>
     <l n="8">The cats are your Voltaires , Rousseaus ; the dogs ,</l>
     <l n="9">Your jailers , Louis , Fredericks and such .</l>
     <l n="10">And O , you blessed cow , you common people ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whom maidens all forlorn attend and milk .</l>
     <l n="12">Here is your Elenor Murray who gives hands ,</l>
     <l n="13">Brain , heart and spirit to the task of milking ,</l>
     <l n="14">And straining milk that other lips may drink ,</l>
     <l n="15">Revive and flourish , wedding , if she weds ,</l>
     <l n="16">The tattered man in church , which is your priest</l>
     <l n="17">Shaven and shorn , and wakened with the sun</l>
     <l n="18">By the cock , theology that keeps the house</l>
     <l n="19">Well timed and ruled for honor unto Jack ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who must have order , rising on the hour ,</l>

     <l n="22">If rats</l>
     <l n="23">Had never lived , or left the malt alone ,</l>
     <l n="24">This girl had lived . Let 's trace the story down :</l>
     <l n="25">We went to France to fight , we go to France</l>
     <l n="26">To get the origin of Elenor 's death .</l>
     <l n="27">It 's 1750 , say , the malt of France</l>
     <l n="28">And Europe , too , is over-run by rats ;</l>
     <l n="29">The nobles and the clergy own the land ,</l>
     <l n="30">Exact the taxes , drink the luscious milk</l>
     <l n="31">Of the crumpled horns . But cats come slinking by</l>
     <l n="32">Called Diderot , Voltaire , Rousseau . Now look !</l>
     <l n="33">Cat Diderot goes after war and taxes ,</l>
     <l n="34">The slave trade , privilege , the merchant stomach .</l>
     <l n="35">In England , too , there is a sly grimalkin ,</l>
     <l n="36">Who poisons rats with most malicious thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="37">And bears the name of Adam — Adam Smith ,</l>
     <l n="38">By Jack named Adam just to signify</l>
     <l n="39">His sinful nature . But the cat Voltaire</l>
     <l n="40">Says Adam never fell , that man is good ,</l>
     <l n="41">An honest merchant better than a king ,</l>
     <l n="42">And shaven priests are worse than parasites .</l>
     <l n="43">He rubs his glossy coat against the legs</l>
     <l n="44">Of Quakers , loving natures , loathes the trade</l>
     <l n="45">Of war , and runs with velvet feet across</l>
     <l n="46">The whole of Europe , scaring rats to death .</l>
     <l n="47">The cat Rousseau is instinct like a cat ,</l>
     <l n="48">And purrs that man born free is still in chains</l>
     <l n="49">Here in this house that Jack built . Consequence ?</l>
     <l n="50">There is such squeaking , running of the rats ,</l>
     <l n="51">The cats in North America wake up</l>
     <l n="52">And drive the English rats out ; then the dogs</l>
     <l n="53">Grow cautious of the cats , poor simple Louis</l>
     <l n="54">Convokes a French assembly to preserve</l>
     <l n="55">The malt against the rats and give the cow</l>
     <l n="56">Whose milk is growing blue and thin some malt .</l>
     <l n="57">And all at once rats , cats and dogs , the cow ,</l>
     <l n="58">The shaven priest , the maiden all forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="59">The tattered man , the cock , are in a hubbub</l>
     <l n="60">Of squeaking , caterwauling , barking , lowing ,</l>
     <l n="61">With cock-a-doodles , curses , prayers and shrieks</l>
     <l n="62">Ascending from the melee . In a word ,</l>
     <l n="63">You have a revolution .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="64">All at once</l>
     <l n="65">A mastiff dog appears and barks : “ Be still . ”</l>
     <l n="66">And in a way in France 's room in the house</l>
     <l n="67">Brings order for a time . He grabs the fabric</l>
     <l n="68">Of the Holy Roman Empire , tears it up ,</l>
     <l n="69">Sends for the shaven priest from Rome and bites</l>
     <l n="70">His shrunken calves ; trots off to Jena where</l>
     <l n="71">He whips the Prussian dogs , but wakes them too</l>
     <l n="72">To breed and multiply , grow strong to fight</l>
     <l n="73">All other dogs in Jack 's house , bite to death</l>
     <l n="74">The maidens all forlorn , like Elenor Murray .</l>

     <l n="75">This mastiff , otherwise Napoleon called ,</l>
     <l n="76">Is downed at last by dogs from everywhere .</l>
     <l n="77">They 're rid of him — but still the house of Jack</l>
     <l n="78">Is better than it was , the rats are thick ,</l>
     <l n="79">But cats grow more abundant , malt is served</l>
     <l n="80">More generously to the cow . The Prussian dogs</l>
     <l n="81">Discover malt 's the thing , also the cow</l>
     <l n="82">Must have her malt , or else the milk gives out .</l>
     <l n="83">But all the while the Prussian dogs grow strong ,</l>
     <l n="84">Well taught and angered by Napoleon .</l>
     <l n="85">And some of them would set the house in order</l>
     <l n="86">After the manner of America .</l>
     <l n="87">But many wish to fight , get larger rooms ,</l>
     <l n="88">Then set the whole in order . At Sadowa</l>
     <l n="89">They whip the Austrian dogs , and once again</l>
     <l n="90">A mastiff comes , a Bismarck , builds a suite</l>
     <l n="91">From north to south , and forces Austria</l>
     <l n="92">To huddle in the kitchen , use the outhouse</l>
     <l n="93">Where Huns and Magyars , Bulgars and the rest</l>
     <l n="94">Keep Babel under Jack who split their tongues</l>
     <l n="95">To make them hate each other and suspect ,</l>
     <l n="96">Not understanding what the other says .</l>
     <l n="97">This very Babel was the cause of death</l>
     <l n="98">Of Elenor Murray , if I chose to stop</l>

     <l n="105">Then pants and wags his tail , and little dreams</l>
     <l n="106">A dachshund in an early day to come</l>

     <l n="117">The English , plainer said . This envy takes</l>
     <l n="118">The form of zeal for country , so he trots</l>
     <l n="119">About the house , gets secrets for reforms</l>
     <l n="120">For Germany , would have his lesser dogs</l>
     <l n="121">All merchants , traders sleek and prosperous ,</l>
     <l n="122">Achieve a noble breed to rule the house .</l>

     <l n="130">The game of old goes on , has only changed</l>
     <l n="131">Its dominant form . Grimalkin , Adam Smith</l>

     <l n="136">For China bound , for Africa , for the Isles</l>
     <l n="137">Of farthest seas take rats , who slip aboard</l>
     <l n="138">And eat their fill before the patient cow ,</l>
     <l n="139">Milked daily as before can lick her tongue</l>
     <l n="140">Against a mouthful of the precious stuff .</l>
     <l n="141">You have your eastern question , and your Congo .</l>

     <l n="144">The dogs jump into China , even we</l>

     <l n="155">The Germans want it , and it 's all for malt .</l>
     <l n="156">Meantime the Balkan Babel leads to war .</l>
     <l n="157">The Slavic peoples do not like the rule</l>

     <l n="160">Southeastern Europe , being crowded out</l>
     <l n="161">By mastiff Bismarck . And again there 's Jack</l>

     <l n="270">Some were in gloom , had quarreled with their beaux ,</l>
     <l n="271">Who did not say farewell . And there were some</l>

     <l n="282">For country , for democracy . ” And to me</l>
     <l n="283">She said : “ My heart is brimming over with love .</l>
     <l n="284">Now I can work and nurse , now use my hands</l>
     <l n="285">To soothe and heal , which burn to finger tips ,</l>

     <l n="287">Oh she had the will ,</l>
     <l n="288">The courage , resolution ; but at last</l>
     <l n="289">They broke her down . And this is how it was :</l>
     <l n="290">Her love for someone gave her zeal and grace</l>
     <l n="291">For watching , working , caring for the sick .</l>
     <l n="292">Her heart was in the cause too — but this love</l>
     <l n="293">Gave beauty , passion to it . All her men</l>
     <l n="294">Stretched out to kiss her hands . It may be true</l>
     <l n="295">The wounded soldier is a grateful soul .</l>
     <l n="296">But in her case they felt a warmer flame ,</l>
     <l n="297">A greater tenderness . So she won her spurs ,</l>
     <l n="298">And honors , was beloved , she had a brain ,</l>
     <l n="299">A fine intelligence . Then at the height</l>
     <l n="300">Of her success , she disobeyed a doctor —</l>
     <l n="301">He was a pigmy — Elenor knew more</l>
     <l n="302">Than he did , but you know the discipline :</l>
     <l n="303">War looses all the hatreds , meanest traits</l>
     <l n="304">Together with the noblest , so she crumpled ,</l>
     <l n="305">Was disciplined for this . About this time</l>
     <l n="306">A letter to the head nurse came — there was</l>
     <l n="307">A Miriam Fay , who by some wretched fate</l>
     <l n="308">Was always after Elenor — it was she</l>
     <l n="309">Who wrote the letter , and the letter said</l>
     <l n="310">To keep a watch on Elenor , lest she snag</l>
     <l n="311">Some officer or soldier . Elenor ,</l>
     <l n="312">Who had no caution , venturesome and brave ,</l>
     <l n="313">Wrote letters more than frank to one she loved</l>
     <l n="314">Whose tenor leaked out through the censorship .</l>
     <l n="315">Her lover sent her telegrams , all opened ,</l>
     <l n="316">And read first by the head nurse . So at last</l>
     <l n="317">Too much was known , and Elenor was eyed ,</l>
     <l n="318">And whispers ran around . Those ugly girls ,</l>
     <l n="319">Who never had a man , were wagging tongues ,</l>
     <l n="320">And still her service was so radiant ,</l>
     <l n="321">So generous and skillful she survived ,</l>
     <l n="322">Helped by the officers , the leading doctors ,</l>
     <l n="323">Who liked her and defended her , perhaps</l>
     <l n="324">In hopes of winning her — you know the game !</l>
     <l n="325">It was through them she went to Nice ; but when</l>
     <l n="326">She came back to her duty all was ready</l>
     <l n="327">To catch her and destroy her — envy played</l>
     <l n="328">Its part , as you can see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="329">Our unit broke ,</l>

     <l n="333">Who was cut off from every one she knew ,</l>
     <l n="334">And shipped out like an animal to be</l>
     <l n="335">With strangers , nurses , doctors , wholly strange .</l>
     <l n="336">The head nurse passed the word along to watch her .</l>

     <l n="338">For service and for country , fed and brightened</l>
     <l n="339">By love for someone , thus was left to burn</l>

     <l n="361">For favors , for the word was well around</l>

     <l n="37">Whose steadiness and business sense made sure</l>
     <l n="38">A prosperous uniformity of life .</l>
     <l n="39">Life does not enter at your door and seek you ,</l>
     <l n="40">And pour her gifts into your lap . She drops</l>
     <l n="41">The chances and the riches here and there .</l>
     <l n="42">They find them who fly forth , as faring birds</l>
     <l n="43">Know northern marshes , rice fields in the south ;</l>
     <l n="44">While the dull turtle waddles in his mud .</l>
     <l n="45">The bird is slain perhaps , the turtle lives ,</l>
     <l n="46">But which has known the thrills ?</l>

     <l n="47">Well , on a time</l>
     <l n="48">Elenor Murray , Janet Stearns , myself</l>
     <l n="49">Thought we would see Seattle and Vancouver ,</l>
     <l n="50">We had saved money teaching school that year —</l>
     <l n="51">The plan was Elenor Murray 's . So we sailed</l>
     <l n="52">To ‘ Frisco from Los Angeles , saw ‘ Frisco</l>
     <l n="53">By daylight , but to see the town by night</l>
     <l n="54">Was Elenor Murray 's wish , and up to now</l>
     <l n="55">We had no men , had found none . Elenor said ,</l>
     <l n="56">“ Let 's go to Palo Alto , find some men . ”</l>
     <l n="57">We landed in a blinding sun , and walked</l>
     <l n="58">About the desolate campus , but no men .</l>
     <l n="59">And Janet and myself were tired and hot ;</l>
     <l n="60">But Elenor , who never knew fatigue ,</l>
     <l n="61">Went searching here and there , and left us sitting</l>
     <l n="62">Under a palm tree waiting . Hours went by ,</l>
     <l n="63">Two hours , I think , when she came down the walk</l>
     <l n="64">A man on either side . She brought them up</l>
     <l n="65">And introduced them . They were gay and young ,</l>
     <l n="66">Students with money . Then the fun began :</l>
     <l n="67">We wished to see the place , must hurry back</l>
     <l n="68">To keep engagements in the city — whew !</l>
     <l n="69">How Elenor Murray baited hooks for us</l>
     <l n="70">With words about the city and our plans ;</l>
     <l n="71">What fun we three had had already there !</l>
     <l n="72">Until at last these fellows begged to come ,</l>
     <l n="73">Return with us to ‘ Frisco , be allowed</l>
     <l n="74">To join our party . “ Could we manage it ? ”</l>
     <l n="75">Asked Elenor Murray , “ do you think we can ? ”</l>
     <l n="76">We fell into the play and talked it over ,</l>
     <l n="77">Considered this and that , resolved the thing ,</l>
     <l n="78">And said at last to come , and come they did ....</l>
     <l n="79">Well , such a time in ‘ Frisco . For you see</l>
     <l n="80">Our money had been figured down to cents</l>
     <l n="81">For what we planned to do . These fellows helped ,</l>
     <l n="82">We scarcely had seen ‘ Frisco but for them .</l>
     <l n="83">They bought our dinners , paid our way about</l>
     <l n="84">Through China Town and so forth , but we kept</l>
     <l n="85">Our staterooms on the boat , slept on the boat .</l>
     <l n="86">And after three days ’ feasting sailed away</l>
     <l n="87">With bouquets for each one of us .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="88">But this girl</l>
     <l n="89">Could never get enough , must on and on</l>
     <l n="90">See more , have more sensations , never tired .</l>
     <l n="91">And when we saw Vancouver then the dream</l>
     <l n="92">Of going to Alaska entered her .</l>
     <l n="93">I had no money , Janet had no money</l>
     <l n="94">To help her out , and Elenor was short .</l>
     <l n="95">We begged her not to try it — what a will !</l>
     <l n="96">She set her jaw and said she meant to go .</l>
     <l n="97">And when we missed her for a day , behold</l>
     <l n="98">We find her , she 's a cashier in a store ,</l>
     <l n="99">And earning money there to take the trip .</l>
     <l n="100">Our boat was going back , we left her there .</l>
     <l n="101">I see her next when school commences , ruling</l>
     <l n="102">Her room of pupils at Los Angeles .</l>
     <l n="103">The summer after this she wandered east ,</l>
     <l n="104">Was now engaged to Simeon Strong , but writing</l>
     <l n="105">To Gregory Wenner , saw him in Chicago .</l>
     <l n="106">She traveled to New York , he followed her .</l>
     <l n="107">She was a girl who had to live her life ,</l>
     <l n="108">Could not live through another , found no man</l>
     <l n="109">Whose life sufficed for hers , must live herself ,</l>
     <l n="110">Be individual .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="111">And en route for France</l>
     <l n="112">She wrote me from New York , was seeing much</l>
     <l n="113">Of Margery , an aunt — I never knew her ,</l>
     <l n="114">But sensed an evil in her , and a mind</l>
     <l n="115">That used the will of Elenor Murray — how</l>
     <l n="116">Or why , I knew not . But she wrote to me</l>
     <l n="117">This Margery had brought her lawyer in ,</l>
     <l n="118">There in New York to draw a document ,</l>
     <l n="119">And put some letters in a safety box .</l>
     <l n="120">Whose letters ? Gregory Wenner 's ? I do n't know .</l>
     <l n="121">She told me much of secrets , but of letters</l>
     <l n="122">That needed for their preciousness a box ,</l>
     <l n="123">A lawyer to arrange the matter , nothing .</l>
     <l n="124">For if there was another man , she felt</l>
     <l n="125">Too shamed , no doubt , to tell me :— “ This is he ,</l>
     <l n="126">The love I sought , the great reality , ”</l>
     <l n="127">When she had said as much of Gregory Wenner .</l>
     <l n="128">But now a deeper matter : with this letter</l>
     <l n="129">She sent a formal writing giving me</l>
     <l n="130">Charge of these letters , if she died to give</l>
     <l n="131">The letters to the writer . I 'm to know</l>
     <l n="132">The identity of the writer , so she planned</l>
     <l n="133">When I obtain them . How about this lawyer ,</l>
     <l n="134">And Margery the aunt ? What shall I do ?</l>
     <l n="135">Write to this lawyer what my duty is</l>
     <l n="136">Appointed me of her , go to New York ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="137">I must do something , for this lawyer has ,</l>
     <l n="138">As I believe , no knowledge of my place</l>
     <l n="139">In this affair . Who has the box 's key ?</l>
     <l n="140">This lawyer , or the aunt — I have no key —</l>
     <l n="141">And if they have the key , or one of them ,</l>
     <l n="142">And enter , take the letters , look ! our friend</l>
     <l n="143">Gets stains upon her memory ; or the man</l>
     <l n="144">Who wrote the letters finds embarrassment .</l>
     <l n="145">Somehow , I think , these letters hold a secret ,</l>
     <l n="146">The deepest of her life and cruelest ,</l>
     <l n="147">And figured in her death . My dearest friend ,</l>
     <l n="148">What if they brought me to the coroner ,</l>
     <l n="149">If I should get these letters , and they learned</l>
     <l n="150">I had them , this relation to our Elenor !</l>
     <l n="151">Yet how can I neglect to write this lawyer</l>
     <l n="152">And tell him Elenor Murray gave to me</l>
     <l n="153">This power of disposition ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="154">Come what may</l>
     <l n="155">I must write to this lawyer . Here I write</l>
     <l n="156">To get the letters , and obey the wish</l>
     <l n="157">Of our dear friend . Our friend who never could</l>
     <l n="158">Carry her ventures to success , but always</l>
     <l n="159">Just at the prosperous moment wrecked her hope .</l>
     <l n="160">She really wished to marry Simeon Strong .</l>
     <l n="161">Then why imperil such a wish by keeping</l>
     <l n="162">This Gregory Wenner friendship living , go</l>
     <l n="163">About with Gregory Wenner , fill the heart</l>
     <l n="164">Of Simeon Strong with doubt ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="165">Oh well , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="166">We wonder at each other , I at you ,</l>
     <l n="167">And you at me , for doing this or that .</l>
     <l n="168">And yet I think no man or woman acts</l>
     <l n="169">Without a certain logic in the act</l>
     <l n="170">Of nature or of circumstance .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="171">Look here ,</l>
     <l n="172">This letter to the lawyer . Will it do ?</l>
     <l n="173">I think so . If it brings the letters — well !</l>
     <l n="174">If not , I 'll get them somehow , it must be ,</l>
     <l n="175">I loved her , faults and all , and so did you ....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="176">So while Jane Fisher pondered on her duty ,</l>
     <l n="177">But did n't write the letter to the lawyer ,</l>
     <l n="178">Who had the charge of Elenor Murray 's letters ,</l>
     <l n="179">The lawyer , Henry Baker , in New York</l>
     <l n="180">Finds great perplexity . Sometimes a case</l>

     <l n="183">With some one rising from the mass of things ,</l>
     <l n="184">Faces and circumstance , that ends his life .</l>

     <l n="1">One partner may consult another — James ,</l>
     <l n="2">Here is a matter you must help me with ,</l>
     <l n="3">It 's coming to a head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Well , to be plain ,</l>
     <l n="5">And to begin at the beginning first ,</l>
     <l n="6">I knew a woman up on Sixty-third ,</l>
     <l n="7">Have known her since I got her a divorce ,</l>
     <l n="8">Married , divorced , before — last night we quarreled ,</l>
     <l n="9">I must do something , hear me and advise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">She is a woman notable for eyes</l>
     <l n="11">Bright for their oblong lights in them ; they seem</l>
     <l n="12">Like crockery vases , rookwood , where the light</l>
     <l n="13">Shows spectrally almost in squares and circles .</l>
     <l n="14">Her skin is fair , nose hooked , of amorous flesh ,</l>
     <l n="15">A feaster and a liver , thinks and plans</l>
     <l n="16">Of money , how to get it . And this husband</l>
     <l n="17">Whom she divorced last summer went away ,</l>
     <l n="18">And left her to get on as best she could .</l>
     <l n="19">All legal matters settled , we went driving —</l>
     <l n="20">This story can be skipped .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">Last night we dined ,</l>
     <l n="22">Afterward went to her apartment . First</l>
     <l n="23">She told me at the dinner that her niece</l>
     <l n="24">Named Elenor Murray died some days ago .</l>
     <l n="25">I sensed what she was after — here 's the point :—</l>
     <l n="26">She followed up the theme when we returned</l>
     <l n="27">To her apartment , where we quarreled . You see</l>
     <l n="28">I would not do her bidding , left her mad ,</l>
     <l n="29">In silent wrath after some bitter words .</l>
     <l n="30">I managed her divorce as I have said ,</l>
     <l n="31">Then I stepped in as lover , months had passed .</l>
     <l n="32">When Elenor Murray came here to New York ,</l>
     <l n="33">I met her at the apartment of the aunt</l>
     <l n="34">Whose name is Margery Camp . Before , she said</l>
     <l n="35">Her niece was here , was happy and in love</l>
     <l n="36">But sorrowful for leaving , just the talk</l>
     <l n="37">That has no meaning till you see the subject</l>
     <l n="38">Or afterwards , perhaps ; it passes in</l>
     <l n="39">One ear and out the other . Then at last</l>
     <l n="40">One afternoon I met this Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="41">When I go up to call on Margery Camp .</l>
     <l n="42">The staging of the matter is like this :</l>
     <l n="43">The niece looks fagged , is sitting on the couch ,</l>
     <l n="44">Has loosed her collar for her throat to feel</l>
     <l n="45">The air about it , for the day is hot .</l>
     <l n="46">And Margery Camp goes out , brings in a pitcher</l>
     <l n="47">Of absinthe cocktails , so we drink . I sit ,</l>
     <l n="48">Begin to study what is done , and look</l>
     <l n="49">This Elenor Murray over , get the thought</l>
     <l n="50">That somehow Margery Camp has taken Elenor</l>
     <l n="51">In her control for something , has begun</l>
     <l n="52">To use her , manage her , is coiling her</l>
     <l n="53">With dominant will or cunning . Then I look ,</l>
     <l n="54">See Margery Camp observing Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="55">Who drinks the absinthe , and in Margery 's eyes</l>
     <l n="56">I see these parallelograms of light</l>
     <l n="57">Just like a vase of crockery , there she stands ,</l>
     <l n="58">Her face like ivory , and laughs and shows</l>
     <l n="59">Her marvelous teeth , smooths with her shapely hands</l>
     <l n="60">The skirt upon her hips . Somehow I feel</l>
     <l n="61">She is a soul who watches passion work .</l>
     <l n="62">Then Elenor Murray rouses , gets her spirits</l>
     <l n="63">Out of the absinthe , rises and exclaims :</l>
     <l n="64">“ I 'm better now ; ” and Margery Camp speaks up ,</l>
     <l n="65">Poor child , in intonation like a doll</l>
     <l n="66">That speaks from reeds of steel , no sympathy</l>
     <l n="67">Or meaning in the words . The interview</l>
     <l n="68">Seems spooky to me , cold and sinister .</l>
     <l n="69">We drink again and then we drink again .</l>
     <l n="70">And what with her fatigue and lowered spirits ,</l>
     <l n="71">This Elenor Murray drifts in talk and mood</l>
     <l n="72">With so much drink . At last this Margery Camp</l>
     <l n="73">Says suddenly : “ You 'll have to help my niece ,</l>
     <l n="74">There is a matter you must manage for her ,</l>
     <l n="75">We 've talked it over ; in a day or two</l>
     <l n="76">Before she goes away , we 'll come to you . ”</l>
     <l n="77">I took them out to dinner , after dinner</l>
     <l n="78">Drove Margery Camp to her apartment , then</l>
     <l n="79">Went down with Elenor Murray to her place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="80">Then in a day or two , one afternoon</l>
     <l n="81">Margery Camp and Elenor Murray came</l>
     <l n="82">Here to my office with a bundle , which</l>
     <l n="83">This Margery Camp was carrying , rather large .</l>
     <l n="84">And Margery Camp was bright and keen as winter .</l>
     <l n="85">But Elenor Murray seemed a little dull ,</l>
     <l n="86">Abstracted as of drink , or thought perhaps .</l>
     <l n="87">After the greeting and preliminaries ,</l>
     <l n="88">Margery said to Elenor : “ Better tell</l>
     <l n="89">What we have come for , get it done and go . ”</l>
     <l n="90">Then Elenor Murray said : “ Here are some letters ,</l>
     <l n="91">I 've tied them in this package , and I wish</l>
     <l n="92">To put them in a safety box , give you</l>
     <l n="93">One key and keep the other , leave with you</l>
     <l n="94">A sealed instruction , which , in case I die ,</l>
     <l n="95">While over-seas , you may break open , read</l>
     <l n="96">And follow , if you will . ” She handed me</l>
     <l n="97">A writing signed by her which merely read</l>
     <l n="98">What I have told you — here it is — you see :</l>
     <l n="99">“ When legal proof is furnished I am dead ,</l>
     <l n="100">Break open the sealed letter which will give</l>
     <l n="101">Instruction for you . ” So I took the trust ,</l>
     <l n="102">Went with these women to a vault and placed</l>
     <l n="103">The letters in the box , gave her a key ,</l>
     <l n="104">Kept one myself . They left . At dinner time</l>
     <l n="105">I joined them , saw more evidence of the will</l>
     <l n="106">Of Margery Camp controlling Elenor 's .</l>
     <l n="107">Which seemed in part an older woman 's power</l>
     <l n="108">Against a younger woman 's , and in part</l>
     <l n="109">Something less innocent . We ate and drank ,</l>
     <l n="110">I took them to their places as before ,</l>
     <l n="111">And did n't see this Elenor again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="112">But now last night when I see Margery</l>
     <l n="113">She says at once , “ My niece is dead ; ” goes on</l>
     <l n="114">To say , no other than herself has care</l>
     <l n="115">Or interest in her , was estranged from father ,</l>
     <l n="116">And mother too , herself the closest heart</l>
     <l n="117">In all the world , and therefore she must look</l>
     <l n="118">After the memory of the niece , and adds :</l>
     <l n="119">“ She came to you through me , I picked you out</l>
     <l n="120">To do this business . ” So she went along</l>
     <l n="121">With this and that , advancing and retreating</l>
     <l n="122">To catch me , bind me . Well , I saw her game ,</l>
     <l n="123">Sat non-committal , sipping wine , but keeping</l>
     <l n="124">The wits she hoped I 'd lose , as I could see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="125">After the dinner we went to her place</l>
     <l n="126">And there she said these letters might contain</l>
     <l n="127">Something to smudge the memory of her niece ,</l>
     <l n="128">She wished she had insisted on the plan</l>
     <l n="129">Of having one of the keys , the sealed instruction</l>
     <l n="130">Made out and left with her ; being her aunt ,</l>
     <l n="131">The closest heart in the world to Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="132">That would have been the right way . But she said</l>
     <l n="133">Her niece was willful and secretive , too ,</l>
     <l n="134">Not over wise , but now that she was dead</l>
     <l n="135">It was her duty to reform the plan ,</l>
     <l n="136">Do what was best , and take control herself .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="137">So working to the point by devious ways</l>
     <l n="138">She said at last : “ You must give me the key ,</l>
     <l n="139">The sealed instruction : I 'll go to the box ,</l>
     <l n="140">And get the letters , do with them as Elenor</l>
     <l n="141">Directed in the letter ; for I think ,</l>
     <l n="142">Cannot believe it different , that my niece</l>
     <l n="143">Has left these letters with me , so directs</l>
     <l n="144">In that sealed letter . ” “ Then if that be true ,</l>
     <l n="145">Why give the key to me , the letter ?— no</l>
     <l n="146">This is a trust , a lawyer would betray ,</l>
     <l n="147">A sacred trust to do what you request . ”</l>
     <l n="148">I saw her growing angry . Then I added :</l>
     <l n="149">“ I have no proof your niece is dead : ” “ My word</l>
     <l n="150">Is good enough , ” she answered , “ we are friends ,</l>
     <l n="151">You are my lover , as I thought ; my word</l>
     <l n="152">Should be sufficient . ” And she kept at me</l>
     <l n="153">Until I said : “ I can n't give you the key ,</l>
     <l n="154">And if I did they would not let you in ,</l>
     <l n="155">You are not registered as a deputy</l>
     <l n="156">To use the key . ” She did not understand ,</l>
     <l n="157">Did not believe me , but she tacked about ,</l>
     <l n="158">And said : “ You can do this , take me along</l>
     <l n="159">When you go to the vault and open the box ,</l>
     <l n="160">And break the letter open which she gave . ”</l>
     <l n="161">I only answered : “ If I find your niece</l>
     <l n="162">Has given these letters to you , you shall have</l>
     <l n="163">The letters , but I think the letters go</l>
     <l n="164">Back to the writer , and if that 's the case ,</l>
     <l n="165">I 'll send them to the writer . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="166">Here at last</l>
     <l n="167">She lost control , took off her mask and stormed :</l>
     <l n="168">“ We 'll see about it . You will scarcely care</l>
     <l n="169">To have the matter aired in court . I 'll see</l>
     <l n="170">A lawyer , bring a suit and try it out ,</l>
     <l n="171">And see if I , the aunt , am not entitled</l>
     <l n="172">To have my niece 's letters and effects ,</l>
     <l n="173">Whatever 's in the package . I am tired</l>
     <l n="174">And cannot see you longer . Take five days</l>
     <l n="175">To think the matter over . If you come</l>
     <l n="176">And do what I request , no suit , but if</l>
     <l n="177">You still refuse , the courts can settle it . ”</l>
     <l n="178">And so I left her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="179">In a day or two</l>
     <l n="180">I read of Elenor Murray 's death . It seems</l>
     <l n="181">The coroner investigates her death .</l>
     <l n="182">She died mysteriously . Well , then I break</l>
     <l n="183">The sealed instruction , look ! I am to send</l>
     <l n="184">The package to Jane Fisher , in Chicago .</l>
     <l n="185">We know , of course , Jane Fisher did not write</l>
     <l n="186">The letters , that the letters are a man 's .</l>
     <l n="187">What is the inference ? Why , that Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="188">Pretended to comply , obey her aunt ,</l>
     <l n="189">Yet slipped between her fingers , did not wish</l>
     <l n="190">The aunt or me to know who wrote the letters .</l>
     <l n="191">Feigned full submission , frankness with the aunt ,</l>
     <l n="192">Yet hid her secret , hid it from the aunt</l>
     <l n="193">Beyond her finding out , if I observe</l>
     <l n="194">The trust imposed , keep hands of Margery Camp</l>
     <l n="195">From getting at the letters .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="196">Now two things :</l>
     <l n="197">Suppose the writer of the letters killed</l>
     <l n="198">This Elenor Murray , is somehow involved</l>
     <l n="199">In Elenor Murray 's death ? If that 's the case ,</l>
     <l n="200">Should not these letters reach the coroner ?</l>
     <l n="201">To help enforce the law is higher trust</l>
     <l n="202">Than doing what a client has commanded .</l>
     <l n="203">And secondly , if Margery Camp should sue ,</l>
     <l n="204">My wife will learn the secret , bring divorce .</l>
     <l n="205">Three days remain before the woman 's threat</l>
     <l n="206">Is ripe to execute . Think over this .</l>
     <l n="207">We 'll talk again — I really need advice ....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="208">So Hunter told the coroner . Then resumed</l>
     <l n="209">The matter was a simple thing : I said</l>
     <l n="210">To telegraph the coroner . You are right :</l>
     <l n="211">Those letters give a clue perhaps , your trust</l>
     <l n="212">Is first to see the law enforced . And yet</l>
     <l n="213">I saw he was confused and drinking too ,</l>
     <l n="214">For fear his wife would learn of Margery Camp .</l>
     <l n="215">I added , for that matter open the box ,</l>
     <l n="216">Take out the letters , find who wrote them , send</l>
     <l n="217">A telegram to the coroner giving the name</l>
     <l n="218">Of the writer of the letters . Well , he nodded ,</l>
     <l n="219">Seemed to consent to anything I said .</l>
     <l n="220">And Hunter left me , leaving me in doubt</l>
     <l n="221">What he would do . And what is next ? Next day</l>
     <l n="222">He 's in the hospital and has pneumonia .</l>
     <l n="223">I take a cab to see him , but I find</l>
     <l n="224">He is too sick to see , is out of mind .</l>
     <l n="225">In three days he is dead . His wife comes in</l>
     <l n="226">And tells me worry killed him — knows the truth</l>
     <l n="227">About this Margery Camp , oh , so she said .</l>
     <l n="228">Had sent a lawyer to her husband asking</l>
     <l n="229">For certain letters of an Elenor Murray .</l>
     <l n="230">And that her husband stood between the fire</l>
     <l n="231">Of some exposure by this Margery Camp ,</l>
     <l n="232">Or suffering these letters to be used</l>
     <l n="233">By Margery Camp against the writer for</l>
     <l n="234">A bit of money . This was Mrs. Hunter 's</l>
     <l n="235">Interpretation . Well , the fact is clear</l>
     <l n="236">That Hunter feared this Margery Camp — was scared</l>
     <l n="237">About his wife who in some way had learned</l>
     <l n="238">just at this time of Margery Camp — I think</l>
     <l n="239">Was called up , written to . Between it all</l>
     <l n="240">Poor Hunter 's worry , far too fast a life ,</l>
     <l n="241">He broke and died . And now you know it all .</l>
     <l n="242">I 've learned no client enters at your door</l>
     <l n="243">And nothing casual happens in the day</l>
     <l n="244">That may not change your life , or bring you death .</l>
     <l n="245">And Hunter in a liaison with Margery</l>
     <l n="246">Is brought within the scope of Elenor 's</l>
     <l n="247">Life and takes his mortal hurt and dies .</l>

     <l n="248">So much for riffles in New York . We turn</l>
     <l n="249">Back to LeRoy and see the riffles there ,</l>
     <l n="250">See all of them together . Loveridge Chase</l>

     <l n="259">A box with letters left by Elenor Murray —</l>
     <l n="260">So for the story . Why not join with me</l>
     <l n="261">And get these letters ? There is money in it ,</l>
     <l n="262">Perhaps , who knows ? I work for Mrs. Hunter —</l>

     <l n="7">Letters belong to him who writes the letters ;</l>

     <l n="13">The coroner</l>

     <l n="16">Who knew this Loveridge Chase , was wondering</l>
     <l n="17">Why Loveridge Chase had taken up the work</l>
     <l n="18">Of secret service , followed it , and asked ,</l>
     <l n="19">“ How did you come to give your brains to this ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who could do other things ? ” And Loveridge said :</l>
     <l n="21">“ A woman made me , I went round the world</l>
     <l n="22">As jackie once , was brought into this world</l>
     <l n="23">By a mother good and wise , but took from her ,</l>
     <l n="24">My father , someone , sense of chivalry</l>
     <l n="25">Too noble for this world , a pity too ,</l>
     <l n="26">Abused too much by women . I came back ,</l>
     <l n="27">Was hired in a bank ; had I gone on</l>
     <l n="28">By this time had been up in banking circles ,</l>
     <l n="29">But something happened . You can guess , I think</l>
     <l n="30">It was a woman , was my wife Leone .</l>
     <l n="31">It matters nothing here , except I knew</l>
     <l n="32">This Elenor Murray through my wife . These two</l>
     <l n="33">Were schoolmates , even chums . I 'll get these letters</l>
     <l n="34">If you commission me . The fact is this :</l>
     <l n="35">I think this Elenor Murray and Leone</l>
     <l n="36">Were kindred spirits , and it does me good</l>
     <l n="37">Now that I 'm living thus without a wife</l>
     <l n="38">To ferret out this matter of Elenor Murray ,</l>
     <l n="39">Perhaps this way , or somewhere on the way ,</l>
     <l n="40">Find news of my Leone ; what life she lives ,</l>
     <l n="41">And where she is . I 'm curious still , you see . ”</l>
     <l n="42">Then Coroner Merival , who had not heard</l>
     <l n="43">Of Elenor Murray 's letters in New York</l>
     <l n="44">Before this talk of Loveridge Chase , who heard</l>
     <l n="45">This story and analysis of Leone</l>
     <l n="46">Mixed in with other talk , and got a light</l>
     <l n="47">On Elenor Murray , said : “ I know your work ,</l>

     <l n="52">A veteran of Belleau , married that day</l>
     <l n="53">To Amy Whidden , on a lofty dune</l>
     <l n="54">At Millers , Indiana , with his bride —</l>

     <l n="60">Or women who had known her , came in touch</l>
     <l n="61">Somehow with her . These newly wedded two</l>

     <l n="63">And watch the white caps pat the sky , and hear</l>

     <l n="1">Dear , let me tell you , safe beside you now ,</l>
     <l n="2">Your hand in mine , here from this peak of sand ,</l>
     <l n="3">Under this pine tree , where the wild grapes spill</l>
     <l n="4">Their fragrance on the lake breeze , from that oak</l>
     <l n="5">Half buried in the sand , devoured by sand —</l>
     <l n="6">The water of the lake is just as blue</l>
     <l n="7">As the sea is there at Nice , the caps as white</l>
     <l n="8">As foam around Mont Boron , Cap Ferrat .</l>
     <l n="9">Here let me tell you things you do not know ,</l>
     <l n="10">I could not write , repeat what well you know ,</l>
     <l n="11">How love of you sustained me , never changed ,</l>
     <l n="12">But through a love was brighter , flame of the torch</l>
     <l n="13">I bore for you in battle , as an incense</l>
     <l n="14">Cast in a flame awakes the deeper essence</l>
     <l n="15">Of fire and makes it mount .</l>

     <l n="19">And pray for that old strength which never knew</l>
     <l n="20">Fatigue or pain — but I am here with you ,</l>
     <l n="21">You are my bride now , I have earned you , dear .</l>
     <l n="22">I fought the fight , endured the endless days</l>
     <l n="23">When rain fell , days of absence , and the days</l>
     <l n="24">Of danger when my only prayer was this :</l>
     <l n="25">Give me , O God , to see you once again .</l>
     <l n="26">This is the deepest rapture , tragedy</l>
     <l n="27">Of this our life , beyond our minds to fathom ,</l>
     <l n="28">A thing to stand in awe of , touch in reverence ,</l>

     <l n="34">To be away from you ! There are no words</l>
     <l n="35">To speak the weary hours of fear and thought ,</l>
     <l n="36">In such an absence , facing death , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="37">A burial in France , with thoughts of you ,</l>
     <l n="38">Mourning some years , perhaps , healed partly then</l>
     <l n="39">And wedded to another ; then at last</l>
     <l n="40">Myself forgot , or nearly so , and life</l>
     <l n="41">Taking you on with duties , house and children ;</l>

     <l n="47">The gulls , the distant smoke , the smell of grapes ,</l>
     <l n="48">The haze of amethyst behind us there ,</l>

     <l n="50">All this is real . This is America .</l>
     <l n="51">The very air we find from coast to coast ,</l>

     <l n="53">I had no sooner landed in New York</l>

     <l n="55">I walked along the streets so happy , light</l>
     <l n="56">Of heart and heard the newsboys , shop-girls talk :</l>
     <l n="57">“ O , what a cheese he is , ” or “ beat it now ” —</l>
     <l n="58">I can n't describe the thrill I had to hear</l>
     <l n="59">This loose abandoned slang spilled all around ,</l>

     <l n="61">And having power to purchase memories</l>
     <l n="62">Of what I loved and lost awhile , my land !</l>
     <l n="63">Well , then I wanted roast-beef , corn on cob ,</l>
     <l n="64">And had them in an hour at early lunch .</l>
     <l n="65">I telegraphed you , gave New York a day ,</l>

     <l n="68">After the war , to live our lives and grow</l>
     <l n="69">And make of love , experience , life more rich .</l>

     <l n="71">Now I will tell you what I promised to tell</l>
     <l n="72">About my illness and the battle — well ,</l>
     <l n="73">I wrote you of my illness , only hinted</l>
     <l n="74">About the care I had , that is the point ;</l>
     <l n="75">‘ Twas care alone that saved me , I was ill</l>
     <l n="76">Beyond all words to tell . And all the while</l>
     <l n="77">I suffered , fearing I would die ; but then</l>
     <l n="78">I could not bear to think I should not rise</l>
     <l n="79">To join my fellows , battle once again ,</l>
     <l n="80">And charge across the trenches , take no part</l>
     <l n="81">In crushing down the Prussian . For I knew</l>
     <l n="82">He would be crushed at last . I could not bear</l>
     <l n="83">To think I should not take a hand in that ,</l>
     <l n="84">Be there when he lay fallen , victory</l>
     <l n="85">From voice to voice should pass along the lines .</l>
     <l n="86">Well , for some weeks I lay there , and at last</l>
     <l n="87">Words dropped around me that the time was near</l>
     <l n="88">For blows to count — would I be there to strike ?</l>
     <l n="89">Could I get well in time ? And every day</l>
     <l n="90">A sweet voice said : “ You 're better , oh it 's great</l>
     <l n="91">How you are growing stronger ; yesterday</l>
     <l n="92">Your fever was but one degree , to-day</l>
     <l n="93">It is a little higher . You must rest ,</l>
     <l n="94">Not think so much ! It may be normal perhaps</l>
     <l n="95">To-morrow or the next day . In a week</l>
     <l n="96">You will be up and gaining , and the battle</l>
     <l n="97">Will not be fought before then , I am sure ,</l>
     <l n="98">And not until you 're well and strong again . ”</l>
     <l n="99">And thus it went from day to day . Such hands</l>
     <l n="100">Washed my hot face and bathed me , tucked me in ,</l>
     <l n="101">And fed me too . And once I said to her :</l>
     <l n="102">“ I love a girl , I must get well to fight ,</l>
     <l n="103">I must get well to go to her . ” And she ,</l>
     <l n="104">It was the nurse I spoke to , took my hand ,</l>
     <l n="105">And turned away with tears . You see it 's there</l>
     <l n="106">We see the big things , nothing else , the things</l>
     <l n="107">That stand out like the mountains , lesser things</l>
     <l n="108">Are lost like little hillocks under the shadows</l>
     <l n="109">Of great emotions , hopes , realities .</l>
     <l n="110">Well , so it went . And on a day she leaned</l>
     <l n="111">Above my face to smooth the pillow out .</l>
     <l n="112">And from her heart a golden locket fell ,</l>
     <l n="113">And dangled by the silver chain . The locket</l>
     <l n="114">Flew open and I saw a face within it ,</l>
     <l n="115">That is I saw there was a face , but saw</l>
     <l n="116">No eyes or hair , saw nothing to limn out</l>
     <l n="117">The face so I would know it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="118">Then I said :</l>
     <l n="119">“ You have a lover , nurse . ” She straightened up</l>
     <l n="120">And questioned me : “ Have you been ill before ?</l>
     <l n="121">Do you know of the care a nurse can give ,</l>
     <l n="122">And what she can withhold ? ” I answered “ Yes . ”</l>
     <l n="123">And then she asked : “ Have you felt in my hands</l>
     <l n="124">Great tenderness , solicitude , even prayer ? ” —</l>
     <l n="125">Here , sweetheart , do not let your eyes get moist ,</l>
     <l n="126">I 'll tell you everything , for you must see</l>
     <l n="127">How spirits work together , love to love</l>
     <l n="128">Passes and does its work .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="129">Well , it was true ,</l>
     <l n="130">I felt her tenderness , which was like prayer ,</l>
     <l n="131">And so I answered her : “ If I get well ,</l>
     <l n="132">You will have cured me with your human love . ”</l>
     <l n="133">And then she said : “ Our unit reached this place</l>
     <l n="134">When there was neither stoves nor lights . At night</l>
     <l n="135">We went to bed by candles . Stumbled around</l>
     <l n="136">Amid the trunks and beds by candle light .</l>
     <l n="137">Well , one of us would light a candle , then</l>
     <l n="138">Each , one by one , the others lighted theirs</l>
     <l n="139">From this one down the room . And so we passed</l>
     <l n="140">The light along . And as a candle died ,</l>
     <l n="141">The others burned , to which the light was passed .</l>
     <l n="142">Well , now , ” she said , “ that is a figure of love :</l>
     <l n="143">We get the flame from someone , light another ,</l>
     <l n="144">Make brighter light by holding flame to flame —</l>
     <l n="145">Sometimes we searched for something , held two candles</l>
     <l n="146">Together for a greater light . And so ,</l>
     <l n="147">My soldier , I have given you the care</l>
     <l n="148">That comes from love — of country and the cause ,</l>
     <l n="149">But brightened , warmed by one from whom the flame</l>
     <l n="150">Was passed to me , a love that took my hand</l>
     <l n="151">And warmed it , made it tender for that love ,</l>
     <l n="152">Which said pour out and serve , take love for him</l>
     <l n="153">And use it in the cause , by using hands</l>
     <l n="154">To bathe , to soothe , to smooth a pillow down ,</l>
     <l n="155">To heal , sustain . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="156">The truth is , dearest heart ,</l>
     <l n="157">I had not lived , I think , except for her .</l>
     <l n="158">And there we were : I filled with love for you ,</l>
     <l n="159">And therefore praying to get well and fight ,</l>
     <l n="160">Be worthy of your love , and there she was</l>
     <l n="161">With love for someone , striving with that love</l>
     <l n="162">To nurse me through and give me well and strong</l>
     <l n="163">To battle in the cause .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="164">Then I got well</l>
     <l n="165">And joined my company . She took my hand</l>
     <l n="166">As I departed , closed her eyes and said :</l>
     <l n="167">“ May God be with you . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="168">Well , it was Belleau ,</l>
     <l n="169">That jungle of machine guns , like a thicket</l>
     <l n="170">Of rattle snakes . And there was just one thing</l>
     <l n="171">To clean that thicket out — we had to charge ,</l>
     <l n="172">And so we yelled and charged . No soldier knows</l>
     <l n="173">How one survives in such a charge as that .</l>
     <l n="174">You simply yell and charge ; the bullets fall</l>
     <l n="175">Like drops of rain around you pitter-pat ;</l>
     <l n="176">And on you go and think : where will it get me ,</l>
     <l n="177">The stomach or the heart or through the head ?</l>
     <l n="178">What will it be like , sudden blackness , pain ,</l>
     <l n="179">No pain at all ? And so you charge the nests .</l>
     <l n="180">The fellows fell around us like tenpins ,</l>
     <l n="181">Dropped guns , or flung them up , fell on their faces ,</l>
     <l n="182">Or toppled backward , pitched ahead and flung</l>
     <l n="183">Their helmets off in pitching . And at last</l>
     <l n="184">I found myself half-dazed , as in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="185">Right in a nest , two Boches facing me ,</l>
     <l n="186">And then I saw this locket , as I saw it</l>
     <l n="187">Fall from her breast , it might have been a glint</l>
     <l n="188">Of metal , flash of firing , I do n't know .</l>
     <l n="189">I only know I ran my bayonet</l>
     <l n="190">Through one of them ; he fell , I stuck the other ,</l>
     <l n="191">Then something stung my side . When I awoke</l>
     <l n="192">I lay upon a cot , and heard the nurses</l>
     <l n="193">Discuss the peace , the armistice was signed ,</l>
     <l n="194">The war was over . Well , and in a way</l>
     <l n="195">We won the war , I won the war , as one</l>
     <l n="196">Who did his part , at least .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="197">Then I got up ,</l>
     <l n="198">But I was weak and dazed . They said to me</l>
     <l n="199">I should not cross the ocean in the winter ,</l>
     <l n="200">My lungs might get infected ; anyway ,</l>
     <l n="201">The flu was raging . So they sent me down</l>
     <l n="202">To Nice upon a furlough , as I wrote .</l>
     <l n="203">I could not write you all I saw and heard ,</l>
     <l n="204">It was all lovely and all memorable .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="205">But first before I picture Nice to you ,</l>
     <l n="206">My days at Nice , lest you have doubts and fears</l>
     <l n="207">When I reveal to you I saw this nurse</l>
     <l n="208">First on the Promenade des Anglais there ,</l>
     <l n="209">Saw much of her in Nice , I saw at once</l>
     <l n="210">She was that Elenor Murray whom they found</l>
     <l n="211">Along the river dead ; and for the rest</l>
     <l n="212">To make all clear , I 'll tell you everything .</l>
     <l n="213">You see I did n't write you of this girl</l>
     <l n="214">And what we did there , lest you might suspect</l>
     <l n="215">Some vagrant mood in me concealed or glossed ,</l>
     <l n="216">Which ended in betrayal of our love .</l>
     <l n="217">Eyes should look into eyes to supplement</l>
     <l n="218">The words of truth with light of truth , where nothing</l>
     <l n="219">Of thoughts that hide have chance to slip and crawl</l>
     <l n="220">Through eyes averted , twinklings , change of light ,</l>
     <l n="221">Or if they do , reveal themselves , as snakes</l>
     <l n="222">Are seen when winding into coverts of grass .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="223">Well , then we met upon the promenade .</l>
     <l n="224">She ran toward me , kissed me — oh so glad .</l>
     <l n="225">I told her of the battle , of my wound .</l>
     <l n="226">And for herself it seemed she had been ill ,</l>
     <l n="227">Off duty for a month before she came</l>
     <l n="228">To Nice for health ; she said as much to me .</l>
     <l n="229">I think she had been ill , yet I could sense ,</l>
     <l n="230">Or seemed to sense a mystery , I do n't know ,</l>
     <l n="231">Behind her illness . Yet you understand</l>
     <l n="232">How it was natural we should be happy</l>
     <l n="233">To meet again , in Nice , too . For you see</l>
     <l n="234">The army life develops comradeship .</l>
     <l n="235">And when we meet the old life rises up</l>
     <l n="236">And wakes its thrills and memories . It seemed</l>
     <l n="237">She had been there some days when I arrived</l>
     <l n="238">And knew the place , and said , “ I 'll show you Nice . ”</l>
     <l n="239">There was a major she was waiting for ,</l>
     <l n="240">As it turned out . He came there in a week ,</l>
     <l n="241">We had some walks together , all the three ,</l>
     <l n="242">And then I lost them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="243">But before he came</l>
     <l n="244">We did the bright cafes and Monte Carlo ,</l>
     <l n="245">And here my little nurse showed something else</l>
     <l n="246">Besides the tender hands , the prayerful soul .</l>
     <l n="247">She had been taking egg-nogs , so she said ,</l>
     <l n="248">But now she took to wine , and drink she could</l>
     <l n="249">Beyond all men I know . I had to stop</l>
     <l n="250">Or fall beneath the table , leaving her</l>
     <l n="251">To order more . And she would sit and weave</l>
     <l n="252">From right to left hip in a rhythmic way ,</l>
     <l n="253">And cast her eyes obliquely right and left .</l>
     <l n="254">It was this way : The music set her thrilling ,</l>
     <l n="255">And keeping time this way . She loved to go</l>
     <l n="256">Where we could see cocotes , adventurers ;</l>
     <l n="257">Where red vitality was feasting , drinking ,</l>
     <l n="258">And dropping gold upon the gaming table .</l>
     <l n="259">We sunned ourselves within the Jardin Public ,</l>
     <l n="260">And walked the beach between the bathing places</l>
     <l n="261">Where they dry orange peel to make perfumes .</l>
     <l n="262">And in that golden sunshine by the sea</l>
     <l n="263">Caught whiffs of lemon blossoms , and each day</l>
     <l n="264">I bought her at the stands acacia ,</l>
     <l n="265">Or red anemones — I tell you all —</l>
     <l n="266">There was no moment that my thought betrayed</l>
     <l n="267">Your heart , dear one . She had been good to me .</l>
     <l n="268">I saw that she was hungry for these things ,</l>
     <l n="269">For rapture , so I gave them — you do n't mind ,</l>
     <l n="270">It came to nothing , dearest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="271">But at last</l>
     <l n="272">A different Elenor Murray than I knew</l>
     <l n="273">There in the hospital took shape before me .</l>
     <l n="274">That serving soul , that maid of humble tasks ,</l>
     <l n="275">And sacrifice for others , and that face</l>
     <l n="276">Of waitress or of ingenue , day by day</l>
     <l n="277">Assumed sophistication , looks and lines</l>
     <l n="278">Of knowledge in the world , experience</l>
     <l n="279">in places of patrician ways . She knew</l>
     <l n="280">New York as well as I , cafes and shops ;</l>
     <l n="281">Dropped pregnant hints at times that made me think</l>
     <l n="282">What more she knew , what she was holding back .</l>
     <l n="283">Until at last all she had done for me</l>
     <l n="284">Seemed just what mortals do to earn their bread</l>
     <l n="285">In any calling , made more generous , maybe ,</l>
     <l n="286">By something in a moment 's mood . In truth</l>
     <l n="287">The ideal showed the clogged pores in the skin</l>
     <l n="288">Under the light she stood in . For you know</l>
     <l n="289">When we see people happy we can say</l>
     <l n="290">Those tears were not all tears — we pitied more</l>
     <l n="291">Than we were wise to pity — that 's the feeling :</l>
     <l n="292">Most men are Puritans in this , I think .</l>
     <l n="293">A woman dancing , drinking , makes you laugh ,</l>
     <l n="294">And half despise yourself for great emotion</l>
     <l n="295">When seeing her in prayer or reverent thought .</l>
     <l n="296">But now I come to something more concrete :</l>
     <l n="297">The day before the major came we lunched</l>
     <l n="298">Where we could see the Mediterranean ,</l>
     <l n="299">The clubs , hotels and villas . There she sat</l>
     <l n="300">All dressed in white , a knitted jacket of silk</l>
     <l n="301">Matching the leaves upon the trees , and looked</l>
     <l n="302">As fashionable as the rest . The waiter came .</l>
     <l n="303">She did not take the card nor order from it ,</l>
     <l n="304">Was nonchalant , familiar , said at last :</l>
     <l n="305">“ We want some Epernay . You have it doubtless . ”</l>
     <l n="306">The waiter bowed . I looked at Elenor ,</l>
     <l n="307">That was the character of revealing things</l>
     <l n="308">I saw from day to day . For truth to tell</l>
     <l n="309">This Epernay might well have been charged water</l>
     <l n="310">For all I knew . I asked her , and she said :</l>
     <l n="311">“ Delicious wine , not strong . ” And so we lunched ,</l>
     <l n="312">And the music stormed , and lunchers gabbled , smoked ,</l>
     <l n="313">And dandies ogled . And this Epernay</l>
     <l n="314">Worked in our blood and Elenor rattled on .</l>
     <l n="315">And she was flinging eyes from right to left</l>
     <l n="316">And moving rhythmically from hip to hip ,</l>
     <l n="317">And with a finger beating out the time .</l>
     <l n="318">Somehow our hands touched , then she closed her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="319">Her body shook a little and grew limp .</l>
     <l n="320">“ What is the matter ? ” Then she raised her eyes</l>
     <l n="321">And looked me through an instant . What , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="322">You wo n't hear any more ? Oh , very well ,</l>
     <l n="323">That 's all , there is no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="324">But after while</l>
     <l n="325">When things got quieter , the lunchers thinned ,</l>
     <l n="326">The music ended , and the wine grown tame</l>
     <l n="327">Within our veins , she told me on a time</l>
     <l n="328">Some years before she was confirmed , and thought</l>
     <l n="329">She 'd take the veil , and for two years or more</l>
     <l n="330">Was all absorbed in pious thoughts and works .</l>
     <l n="331">“ But how we learn and change , ” she added then ,</l>
     <l n="332">“ In training we see bodies , learn to know</l>
     <l n="333">How thirst and hunger , needs of body cry</l>
     <l n="334">For daily care , become materialists ,</l>
     <l n="335">Unmoralists a little in the sense</l>
     <l n="336">That any book , or theories of the soul</l>
     <l n="337">Should tie the body from its natural needs .</l>
     <l n="338">Though I accept the faith , no less than ever ,</l>
     <l n="339">That God is and the Savior is and spirit</l>
     <l n="340">Is no less real than body , has its needs ,</l>
     <l n="341">Separate or through the body . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="342">Oh , that girl !</l>
     <l n="343">She made me guess and wonder . But next day</l>
     <l n="344">I had a fresh surprise , the major came</l>
     <l n="345">And she was changed completely . I forgot ,</l>
     <l n="346">I must tell you what happened after lunch .</l>
     <l n="347">We rose and she grew impish , stood and laughed</l>
     <l n="348">As if the secret of the laugh was hers</l>
     <l n="349">Beyond the concrete matter of the laugh .</l>
     <l n="350">She said , “ I 'll show you something beautiful . ”</l>
     <l n="351">We started out to see it , walked the road</l>
     <l n="352">Around the foot of Castle Hill . You know</l>
     <l n="353">The wind blows gustily at Nice ; and so</l>
     <l n="354">All of a sudden went my hat , way up ,</l>
     <l n="355">Far off , and instantly such laughter rose ,</l>
     <l n="356">And boisterous shouts that made me think at once</l>
     <l n="357">I had been tricked , somehow . It is this way :</l>
     <l n="358">The gamins loiter there to watch the victims</l>
     <l n="359">Who lose their hats . And Elenor sat down ,</l>
     <l n="360">And laughed until she cried . I do not know ,</l>
     <l n="361">Perhaps I was not amorous enough</l>
     <l n="362">At luncheon and she pranked me for revenge .</l>
     <l n="363">Well , then the major came , he took my place .</l>
     <l n="364">I was the third one in the party now ,</l>
     <l n="365">But saw them every day . What did we do ?</l>
     <l n="366">No Monte Carlo now , nor ordering</l>
     <l n="367">Without the card , she was completely changed ,</l>
     <l n="368">Demure again , all words of lovely things :</l>
     <l n="369">The war had changed the world , had lifted up</l>
     <l n="370">The spirit of man to visions , and the major</l>
     <l n="371">Adored her , drank it in . And we explored</l>
     <l n="372">Limpia and the Old Town , looked aloft</l>
     <l n="373">At Mont Cau d'Aspremont , picked hellebore ,</l>
     <l n="374">And orchids in the gorges , saw St. Pons ,</l>
     <l n="375">The Valley of Hepaticas , sunned ourselves</l>
     <l n="376">Within the Jardin Public , where the children</l>
     <l n="377">Play riotously ; and Elenor would draw</l>
     <l n="378">A straying child to her and say : “ You darling . ”</l>
     <l n="379">I saw her do this once and dry her eyes</l>
     <l n="380">And to the major say : “ They are so lovely ,</l>
     <l n="381">I had to give up teaching school , the children</l>
     <l n="382">Stirred my emotions till I could not bear</l>
     <l n="383">To be among them . ” And to make an end ,</l>
     <l n="384">I spent the parts of three days with these two .</l>
     <l n="385">And on the last day we went to the summit</l>
     <l n="386">Of the Corinche Road , and saw the sea and Europe</l>
     <l n="387">Spread out before us — oh , you cannot know</l>
     <l n="388">The beauty of it , dear , until you see it .</l>
     <l n="389">And Elenor sat down as in a trance ,</l>
     <l n="390">And looked and did not speak for minutes . Then</l>

     <l n="9">Was bathed in tears and strained with agony .</l>
     <l n="10">And after that he saw her in the wards ;</l>

     <l n="17">Of crystal water , nor corrupts it , keeps</l>
     <l n="18">Its poisoned , heavier medium apart ,</l>
     <l n="19">So at the hospital where the nurses ’ hands</l>

     <l n="34">The soul of you , its human tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="35">Its prodigal power of giving , pouring forth</l>
     <l n="36">Itself for others . And you seem a soul</l>
     <l n="37">Where nothing of our human frailty</l>
     <l n="38">Has come to dim the flame that burns in you ,</l>
     <l n="39">You are all light , I think . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="40">And Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="41">Looked down and said : “ There is no soul like that .</l>

     <l n="43">The good and bad together of our souls .</l>
     <l n="44">You are a boy — oh such a boy to see</l>

     <l n="50">This was after</l>

     <l n="54">Elenor Murray</l>

     <l n="57">Nor guess each other 's secrets . ” And she glanced</l>
     <l n="58">A moment at the tragedy that had come</l>
     <l n="59">To her at Paris on her furlough there ,</l>
     <l n="60">And of its train of sorrows , even now</l>
     <l n="61">Her broken health and failure in the work</l>
     <l n="62">As consequence to that , and how it brought</l>
     <l n="63">The breaking of her passionate will and dream</l>
     <l n="64">To serve and not to fail — she glanced at this</l>
     <l n="65">A moment as she faced him , looked at him .</l>
     <l n="66">Then as she turned away : “ There is one thing</l>

     <l n="71">So Major Petain , Elenor Murray walked</l>
     <l n="72">The Promenade at Nice , arm fast in arm .</l>
     <l n="73">And Major Petain to relieve his heart</l>
     <l n="74">Told all the tragedy that had come to him :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="75">“ Duty to France was first with me where love</l>
     <l n="76">Was paramount with you , if I divine</l>
     <l n="77">Your heart , America 's , at least a love</l>
     <l n="78">Unmixed of other feelings as may be .</l>
     <l n="79">What could you find here , if you seek no husband ,</l>
     <l n="80">Even in seeing France so partially ?</l>
     <l n="81">What in adventure , lures to bring you here ,</l>
     <l n="82">Where peril , labor are ? You either came</l>
     <l n="83">To expiate your soul , or as you say ,</l>
     <l n="84">To make more worthy of this man beloved</l>
     <l n="85">Back in America your love for him .</l>
     <l n="86">Dear idealist , I give my faith to you ,</l>
     <l n="87">And all your words . But as I said ‘ twas duty ,</l>
     <l n="88">Then dreams of freedom , Europe 's chains struck off ,</l>
     <l n="89">The menace of the German crushed to earth</l>
     <l n="90">That fired me as a soldier , trained to go</l>
     <l n="91">When France should need me . So it is you saw</l>
     <l n="92">France go about this business calm and stern ,</l>
     <l n="93">And patient for the prize , or if ‘ twere lost</l>
     <l n="94">Then brave to meet the future as France met</l>
     <l n="95">The arduous years that followed Metz , Sedan . ”</l>

     <l n="110">Great danger , as you know , for her and me .</l>
     <l n="111">And yet it never stopped us , gave us fear .</l>
     <l n="112">And then I schemed and got her through the lines ,</l>

     <l n="117">He put by woman chances that arose</l>
     <l n="118">With saying , I am married , am beloved ,</l>
     <l n="119">I love my wife , all said so earnestly</l>
     <l n="120">We could not joke him , though behind his back</l>
     <l n="121">Some said : He trusts her , but he 'd better watch ;</l>
     <l n="122">At least no sense of passing good things by .</l>
     <l n="123">I sat with him at mess , I saw him read</l>

     <l n="21">A woman kneeling , knelt beside the woman ,</l>

     <l n="44">Fell fainting at the Virgin 's feet and lay</l>
     <l n="45">Unconscious in the garden .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">When she woke</l>
     <l n="47">Two nuns were standing by , and one was dressed</l>
     <l n="48">In purest white , and held within her hands</l>
     <l n="49">A tray of gold , and on the tray of gold</l>
     <l n="50">There was a glass of wine , and in a cup</l>
     <l n="51">Some broth of beef , and on a plate of gold</l>
     <l n="52">A wafer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">And the other nun was dressed</l>
     <l n="54">In purest white , but over her shoulders lay</l>
     <l n="55">A cape of blue , blue as the sky of Florence</l>
     <l n="56">Above the garden wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">Then as she saw</l>
     <l n="58">The nuns before her , in the interval</l>
     <l n="59">Of gathering thought , re-limning life again</l>
     <l n="60">From wonder if she had not died , and these</l>
     <l n="61">Were guides or ministrants of another world ,</l>
     <l n="62">The nun with cape of blue to Elenor</l>
     <l n="63">Said : “ Drink this wine , this broth ; ” and Elenor</l>
     <l n="64">Drank and arose , being lifted up by them ,</l>
     <l n="65">And taken through the convent door and given</l>
     <l n="66">A little room as white and clean as light ,</l>
     <l n="67">And a bed of snowy linen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="68">Then they said :</l>
     <l n="69">“ This is the Convent where we send up prayers ,</l>
     <l n="70">Prayers for the souls who do not pray for self —</l>
     <l n="71">Rest , child , and be at peace ; and if there be</l>
     <l n="72">Friends you would tell that you are here , then we</l>
     <l n="73">Will send the word for you , sleep now and rest . ”</l>
     <l n="74">And listening to their voices Elenor slept .</l>
     <l n="75">And when she woke a nurse was at her side ,</l>
     <l n="76">And food was served her , broths and fruit . Each day</l>
     <l n="77">A doctor came to tell her all was well ,</l>
     <l n="78">And health would soon return .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="79">So for a month</l>
     <l n="80">Elenor Murray lay and heard the bells ,</l>
     <l n="81">And breathed the fragrance of the flowering city</l>
     <l n="82">That floated through her window , in the stillness</l>
     <l n="83">Of the convent dreamed , and said to self : This place</l>
     <l n="84">Is good to die in , who is there to tell</l>
     <l n="85">That I am here ? There was no one . To them</l>
     <l n="86">She gave her name , but said : “ Till I am well</l>
     <l n="87">Let me remain , and if I die , some place</l>
     <l n="88">Must be for me for burial , put me there .</l>
     <l n="89">And if I live to go again to France</l>
     <l n="90">And join my unit , let me have a writing</l>
     <l n="91">That I did not desert , was stricken here</l>
     <l n="92">And could not leave . For while I stole away</l>
     <l n="93">From Nice to get a glimpse of Italy ,</l>
     <l n="94">I might have done so in my furlough time ,</l>
     <l n="95">And not stayed over it . ” And to Elenor</l>
     <l n="96">The nuns said : “ We will help you , but for now</l>
     <l n="97">Rest and put by anxieties . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="98">On a day</l>
     <l n="99">Elenor Murray made confessional .</l>
     <l n="100">And to the nuns told bit by bit her life ,</l>
     <l n="101">Her childhood , schooling , travels , work in the war ,</l>
     <l n="102">What fate had followed her , what sufferings .</l>
     <l n="103">And Sister Mary , she who saw her first ,</l>
     <l n="104">And held the tray of gold with wine and broth ,</l>
     <l n="105">Sat often with her , read to her , and said :</l>
     <l n="106">“ Letters will go ahead of you to clear</l>
     <l n="107">Your absence over time — be not afraid ,</l>
     <l n="108">All will be well . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="109">And so when Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="110">Arose to leave she found all things prepared :</l>
     <l n="111">A cab to take her to the train , compartments</l>
     <l n="112">Reserved for her from place to place , her fare</l>
     <l n="113">And tickets paid for , till at last she came</l>
     <l n="114">To Brest and joined her unit , in three days</l>
     <l n="115">Looked at the rolling waters as the ship</l>
     <l n="116">Drove to America — such a coming home !</l>
     <l n="117">To what and whom ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="118">Loveridge Chase returned and brought the letters</l>
     <l n="119">To Coroner Merival from New York . That day</l>
     <l n="120">The chemical analysis was finished , showed</l>
     <l n="121">No ricin and no poison . Elenor Murray</l>
     <l n="122">Died how ? What were the circumstances ? Then</l>
     <l n="123">When Coroner Merival broke the seals of wax ,</l>
     <l n="124">And cut the twine that bound the package , found</l>
     <l n="125">The man was Barrett Bays who wrote the letters —</l>
     <l n="126">There were a hundred — then he cast about</l>
     <l n="127">To lay his hands on Barrett Bays , and found</l>
     <l n="128">That Barrett Bays lived in Chicago , taught ,</l>
     <l n="129">Was a professor , aged some forty years .</l>
     <l n="130">Why did this Barrett Bays emerge not , speak ,</l>
     <l n="131">Come forward ? Was it simply to conceal</l>
     <l n="132">A passion written in these letters here</l>
     <l n="133">For his sake or his wife 's ? Or was it guilt</l>
     <l n="134">For some complicity in Elenor 's death ?</l>
     <l n="135">And on this day the coroner had a letter</l>
     <l n="136">From Margery Camp which said : “ Where 's Barrett Bays ?</l>
     <l n="137">Why have you not arrested him ? He knows</l>
     <l n="138">Something , perhaps about the death of Elenor . ”</l>
     <l n="139">So Coroner Merival sent process forth</l>
     <l n="140">To bring in Barrett Bays , non est inventus .</l>
     <l n="141">He had not visited his place of teaching ,</l>
     <l n="142">Been seen in haunts accustomed for some days —</l>
     <l n="143">Not since the death of Elenor Murray , none</l>
     <l n="144">Knew where to find him , and none seemed to know</l>
     <l n="145">What lay between this man and Elenor Murray .</l>
     <l n="146">This was the more suspicious . Then the Times</l>
     <l n="147">Made headlines of the letters , published some</l>
     <l n="148">Wherein this Barrett Bays had written Elenor :</l>
     <l n="149">“ You are my hope in life , my morning star ,</l>
     <l n="150">My love at last , my all . ” From coast to coast</l>
     <l n="151">The word was flashed about this Barrett Bays ;</l>
     <l n="152">And Mrs. Bays at Martha 's Vineyard read ,</l>
     <l n="153">Turned up her nose , continued on the round</l>
     <l n="154">Of gaieties , but to a chum relieved</l>
     <l n="155">Her loathing with these words : “ Another woman ,</l>
     <l n="156">He 's soiled himself at last . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="157">And Barrett Bays ,</l>
     <l n="158">Who roughed it in the Adirondacks , hoped</l>
     <l n="159">The inquest 's end would leave him undisclosed</l>
     <l n="160">In Elenor Murray 's life , though wracked with fear</l>
     <l n="161">About the letters in the vault , some day</l>
     <l n="162">To be unearthed , or taken , it might be ,</l>
     <l n="163">By Margery Camp for uses sinister —</l>
     <l n="164">He reading that the letters had been given</l>
     <l n="165">To Coroner Merival , and seeing his name</l>
     <l n="166">Printed in every sheet , saw no escape</l>
     <l n="167">In any nook of earth , returned and walked</l>
     <l n="168">In Merival 's office : trembling , white as snow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="169">So Barrett Bays was sworn , before the jury</l>
     <l n="170">Sat and replied to questions , said he knew</l>
     <l n="171">Elenor Murray in the fall before</l>
     <l n="172">She went to France , saw much of her for weeks ;</l>
     <l n="173">Had written her these letters before she left .</l>
     <l n="174">Had followed her in the war , and gone to France ,</l>
     <l n="175">Had seen her for some days in Paris when</l>
     <l n="176">She had a furlough . Had come back and parted</l>
     <l n="177">With Elenor Murray , broken with her , found</l>
     <l n="178">A cause for crushing out his love for her .</l>
     <l n="179">Came back to win forgetfulness , had written</l>
     <l n="180">No word to her since leaving Paris — let</l>
     <l n="181">Her letters lie unanswered ; brought her letters ,</l>
     <l n="182">And gave them to the coroner . Then he told</l>
     <l n="183">Of the day before her death , and how she came</l>
     <l n="184">By motor to Chicago with her aunt ,</l>
     <l n="185">Named Irma Leese , and telephoned him , begged</l>
     <l n="186">An hour for talk . “ Come meet me by the river , ”</l>
     <l n="187">She had said . And so went to meet her . Then he told</l>
     <l n="188">Why he relented , after he had left her</l>
     <l n="189">In Paris with no word beside this one :</l>
     <l n="190">“ This is the end . ” Now he was curious</l>
     <l n="191">To know what she would say , what could be said</l>
     <l n="192">Beyond what she had written — so he went</l>
     <l n="193">Out of a curious but hardened heart .</l>

     <l n="1">“ I was walking by the river , ” Barrett said ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ When she arrived . I took her hand , no kiss ,</l>
     <l n="3">A silence for some minutes as we walked .</l>
     <l n="4">Then we began to take up point by point ,</l>
     <l n="5">For she was concentrated on the hope</l>
     <l n="6">Of clearing up all doubtful things that we</l>
     <l n="7">Might start anew , clear visioned , perfect friends ,</l>
     <l n="8">More perfect for mistakes and clouds . Her will</l>
     <l n="9">Was passionate beyond all other wills ,</l>
     <l n="10">And when she set her mind upon a course</l>
     <l n="11">She could not be diverted , or if so ,</l>
     <l n="12">Her failure kept her brooding . What with me</l>
     <l n="13">She wanted after what had stunned my faith</l>
     <l n="14">I knew not , save she loved me . For in truth</l>
     <l n="15">I have no money , and no prospects either</l>
     <l n="16">To tempt cupidity . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">“ Well ; first we talked —</l>
     <l n="18">You must be patient with me , gentlemen ,</l>
     <l n="19">You see my nerves — they 're weakened — but I 'll try</l>
     <l n="20">To tell you all — well then — a glass of water —</l>
     <l n="21">At first we talked but trifles . Silences</l>
     <l n="22">Came on us like great calms between the stir</l>
     <l n="23">Of ineffectual breezes , like this day</l>
     <l n="24">In August growing sultry as the sun</l>
     <l n="25">Rose upward . She was striving to break down</l>
     <l n="26">The hard corrosion of my thought , and I</l>
     <l n="27">Could not surrender . Till at last , I said :</l>
     <l n="28">‘ That day in Paris when you stood revealed</l>
     <l n="29">Can never be forgotten . Once I killed</l>
     <l n="30">A love with hatred for a woman who</l>
     <l n="31">Betrayed me , as you did . And you can kill</l>
     <l n="32">A love with hatred but you kill your soul</l>
     <l n="33">While killing love . And so with you I kept</l>
     <l n="34">All hatred from my heart , but cannot keep</l>
     <l n="35">A poisonous doubt of you from blood and brain . ’ ...</l>
     <l n="36">I learned in Paris , ( to be clear on this ) ,</l>
     <l n="37">That after she had given herself to me</l>
     <l n="38">She fell back in the arms of Gregory Wenner .</l>
     <l n="39">And here as we were walking I revealed</l>
     <l n="40">My agony , my anger , emptied out</l>
     <l n="41">My heart of all its bitterness . At last</l>
     <l n="42">When she protested it was natural</l>
     <l n="43">For her to do what she had done , the act</l>
     <l n="44">As natural as breathing , taking food ,</l>
     <l n="45">Not signifying faithlessness nor love —</l>
     <l n="46">Though she admitted had she loved me then</l>
     <l n="47">She had not done so — I grew tense with rage ,</l>
     <l n="48">A serpent which grows stiff and rears its head</l>
     <l n="49">To strike its enemy was what I seemed</l>
     <l n="50">To myself then , and so I said to her</l>
     <l n="51">In voice controlled and low , but deadly clear ,</l>
     <l n="52">‘ What are you but a whore — you are a whore ! ’</l>
     <l n="53">Murderous words no doubt , but do you hear</l>
     <l n="54">She justified herself with Gregory Wenner ;</l>
     <l n="55">Yes , justified herself when she had written</l>
     <l n="56">And asked forgiveness — yes , brought me out</l>
     <l n="57">To meet her by the river . And for what ?</l>
     <l n="58">I said you whore , she shook from head to heels ,</l>
     <l n="59">And toppled , but I caught her in my arms ,</l>
     <l n="60">And held her up , she paled , head rolled around ,</l>
     <l n="61">Her eyes set , mouth fell open , all at once</l>
     <l n="62">I saw that she was dead , or syncope</l>
     <l n="63">Profound had come upon her . Elenor ,</l>
     <l n="64">What is the matter ? Love came back to me ,</l>
     <l n="65">Love there with Death . I laid her on the ground .</l>
     <l n="66">I found her dead .</l>

     <l n="71">And if I had that thought , as I believe ,</l>
     <l n="72">I had no other ; all my mind 's a blank</l>
     <l n="73">Until I find myself at one o'clock</l>
     <l n="74">Disrobing in my room , too full of drink ,</l>

     <l n="76">“ With the morning</l>

     <l n="84">I did not kill her . If the inquest showed</l>

     <l n="86">Of me , why then my secret might be hidden</l>
     <l n="87">In Elenor Murray 's grave . And if they found</l>
     <l n="88">That I was with her , brought me in the court ,</l>
     <l n="89">I could make clear my innocence . And thus</l>
     <l n="90">I watched the papers , gambled with the chance</l>

     <l n="92">Does this sound like a coward ? Put yourself</l>
     <l n="93">In my place in that horror . Think of me</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="96">And thus he spoke and twisted hands , and twitched ,</l>
     <l n="97">And ended suddenly . Then David Borrow ,</l>
     <l n="98">And Winthrop Marion with the coroner</l>
     <l n="99">Shot questions at him till he woke , regained</l>
     <l n="100">A memory , concentration : Who are you ?</l>
     <l n="101">What was your youth ? Your love life ? What your wife ?</l>
     <l n="102">Where did you meet this Elenor at the first ?</l>
     <l n="103">Why did you go to France ? In Paris what</l>
     <l n="104">Happened to break your balance ? Tell us all .</l>
     <l n="105">For as they eyed him , he looked down , away ,</l>
     <l n="106">Stirred restless in the chair . And was it truth</l>
     <l n="107">He told of meeting Elenor , her death ?</l>
     <l n="108">Guilt like a guise was on his face . And one —</l>
     <l n="109">This Isaac Newfeldt , juryman , whispered , “ Look ,</l>
     <l n="110">That man is guilty , let us fly the questions</l>
     <l n="111">Like arrows at him till we bring him down . ”</l>
     <l n="112">And as they flew the arrows he came to</l>
     <l n="113">And spoke as follows :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="114">“ First , I am a heart</l>
     <l n="115">That from my youth has sought for love and hungered .</l>
     <l n="116">And Elenor Murray 's heart had hungered too ,</l>
     <l n="117">Which drew our hearts together , made our love</l>
     <l n="118">As it were mystical , more real . I was</l>
     <l n="119">A boy who sought for beauty , hope and faith</l>
     <l n="120">In woman 's love ; at fourteen met a girl</l>
     <l n="121">Who carried me to ecstasy till I walked</l>
     <l n="122">In dreamland , stepping clouds . She loved me too .</l>
     <l n="123">I could not cure my heart , have always felt</l>
     <l n="124">A dull pain for that girl . She died , you know .</l>
     <l n="125">I found another , rather made myself</l>
     <l n="126">Discover my ideal in her , until</l>
     <l n="127">My heart was sure she was the one . And then</l>
     <l n="128">I woke up from this trance , went to another</l>
     <l n="129">Still searching ; always searching , reaching now</l>
     <l n="130">An early cynicism , how to play with hearts ,</l>
     <l n="131">Extract their beauty , pass to someone else .</l>
     <l n="132">I was a little tired now , seemed to know</l>
     <l n="133">There is no wonder woman , just a woman</l>
     <l n="134">Somewhere to be a wife . And then I met</l>
     <l n="135">The woman whom I married , thought to solve</l>
     <l n="136">My problem with the average things of life ;</l>
     <l n="137">The satisfaction of insistent sex ,</l>
     <l n="138">A home , a regular program , turn to work ,</l>
     <l n="139">Forget the dream , the quest . What did I find ?</l>
     <l n="140">A woman who exhausted me and bored me ,</l>
     <l n="141">Stirred never a thought , a fancy , brought no friends ,</l>
     <l n="142">No pleasures or diversions , took from me</l>
     <l n="143">All that I had to give of mind and heart ,</l>
     <l n="144">Purse , or what not . And she was barren too ,</l>
     <l n="145">And restless ; by that restlessness relieved</l>

     <l n="152">Your married man ; but on the other hand</l>

     <l n="154">Six months or more of every year ? And when</l>
     <l n="155">I said to her , divorce me , she would say ,</l>
     <l n="156">You want your freedom to get married — well ,</l>
     <l n="157">The other woman shall not have you , if</l>
     <l n="158">There is another woman , as I think .</l>
     <l n="159">And so the years went by . I 'm thirty-five</l>
     <l n="160">And meet a woman , play light heartedly ,</l>
     <l n="161">She is past thirty , understands nor asks</l>
     <l n="162">A serious love . It 's summer and we jaunt</l>
     <l n="163">About the country , for my wife 's away .</l>
     <l n="164">As usual , in the fall returns , and then</l>
     <l n="165">My woman says , the holiday is over ,</l>
     <l n="166">Go back to work , and I 'll go back to work .</l>
     <l n="167">I cannot give her up , would still go on</l>
     <l n="168">For this delight so sweet to me . By will</l>
     <l n="169">I hold her , stir the fire up to inflame</l>
     <l n="170">Her hands for me , make love to her in short</l>
     <l n="171">And find myself in love , beholding in her</l>
     <l n="172">All beauties and all virtues . Well , at first</l>
     <l n="173">What did I care what she had been before ,</l>
     <l n="174">Whose mistress , sweetheart ? Now I cared and asked</l>
     <l n="175">Fidelity from her , and this she pledged .</l>

     <l n="181">Are wet with kisses given you ? I think</l>
     <l n="182">A woman may be true in marriage , never</l>
     <l n="183">In any free relationship . And then</l>

     <l n="193">An hour of rapture where it came to me .</l>
     <l n="194">And all the time my wife was much away ,</l>
     <l n="195">Yet left me in this state where I was kept</l>
     <l n="196">From serious love if I had found the woman .</l>

     <l n="263">This Something will reveal itself so clear</l>
     <l n="264">That men like David Barrow can perceive .</l>
     <l n="265">And Love , this spirit , twin of Death , you see</l>
     <l n="266">Love slays this girl , but Love remains to slay ,</l>
     <l n="267">Lift up , drive on and slay . I call Death twin</l>
     <l n="268">Of Love , and why ? Because two things alone</l>
     <l n="269">Make what we are and live , first Love the flame ,</l>
     <l n="270">And Death the cap that snuffs it . Is it bread</l>
     <l n="271">That keeps us dancing , skating like these bugs</l>
     <l n="272">That play criss-cross on evening waters ?— no !</l>
     <l n="273">It 's bread to get more life to give more love ,</l>
     <l n="274">Bring to some heart a fuller life , receive</l>
     <l n="275">A fuller life for having given life .</l>
     <l n="276">This force of love may look demonical .</l>
     <l n="277">It tears , destroys , and crushes , chokes and kills ,</l>
     <l n="278">Is always stretching hands to Death its twin .</l>
     <l n="279">And yet it is creation and creates ,</l>
     <l n="280">Feeds roses , jonquils , columbines , gardenias ,</l>
     <l n="281">As well as thistles , cockle burrs and thorns .</l>
     <l n="282">This is the force to which the girl 's alert ,</l>
     <l n="283">And sensitive , is shaken by its power ,</l>
     <l n="284">Driven , uplifted , purified ; a doll</l>
     <l n="285">Of paper dancing on magnetic plates ;</l>
     <l n="286">And by that passion lusts for Death himself ,</l>
     <l n="287">For union with another , sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="288">Beauty , and she aspires and toils , and turns</l>
     <l n="289">To God , the symptom always of this nature .</l>
     <l n="290">My fellow-jurymen , you 'll never see ,</l>
     <l n="291">Or learn so well about another soul</l>
     <l n="292">That had this Love force deeper in her flesh ,</l>
     <l n="293">Her spirit , suffered more . Why do we suffer ?</l>
     <l n="294">What is this love force ? ‘ Tis the child of blood</l>
     <l n="295">Of madness , as this Elenor is the seed</l>
     <l n="296">Of that old grandma , who was mad , and cousin</l>
     <l n="297">Of Taylor who did murder . What is this</l>
     <l n="298">But human spirit flamed and subtleized</l>
     <l n="299">Until it is a poison and a food ;</l>
     <l n="300">A madness but a clearest sanity ;</l>
     <l n="301">A vision and a blindness , all as if</l>
     <l n="302">When nature goes so far , refines so much</l>
     <l n="303">Her balance has been broken , if the Something</l>
     <l n="304">Makes not a genius or a giant soul .</l>
     <l n="305">And so we suffer . But why do we suffer ?</l>
     <l n="306">Well , not as Barrow said , that life is bad ;</l>
     <l n="307">A failure and a fraud . Not suffering</l>
     <l n="308">That points to dust , defeat , is painfulest ;</l>
     <l n="309">But suffering that points to skies and realms</l>
     <l n="310">Above us , whence we came , or where we go ,</l>
     <l n="311">That suffering is most poignant , as it is</l>
     <l n="312">Significant as well , and rapturous too .</l>
     <l n="313">The pain that thrills us for the singing Flame</l>
     <l n="314">Of Love , the force creative , that 's the pain !</l>
     <l n="315">And those must suffer most to whom the sounds</l>
     <l n="316">Of music or of words , or scents , or scenes</l>
     <l n="317">Recall lost realms . No soul can understand</l>
     <l n="318">Music or words in whom there is not stirred</l>
     <l n="319">A recollection — that is genius too :</l>
     <l n="320">A memory , and reliving hours we lived</l>
     <l n="321">Before we looked upon this world of man . ” ...</l>

     <l n="322">Then Winthrop Marion said : “ I like your talk ,</l>
     <l n="323">Llewellyn George , but still what killed the girl ?</l>
     <l n="324">What was the cause of death of Elenor Murray ?</l>
     <l n="325">She died from syncope , that 's clear enough .</l>
     <l n="326">The doctors tell us that in syncope</l>
     <l n="327">The victim should be laid down , not held up .</l>
     <l n="328">And Barrett Bays , the bungler , held her up</l>
     <l n="329">When she was stricken — like the man , I think !</l>
     <l n="330">Well , Coroner , suppose we make a verdict ,</l>
     <l n="331">And say we find that had this Barrett Bays</l>
     <l n="332">Sustained this Elenor Murray in the war ,</l>
     <l n="333">And in her life , with friendship , and with faith</l>
     <l n="334">She had not died . Suppose we further find</l>
     <l n="335">That when he took her , held her in his arms</l>
     <l n="336">When she had syncope , he was dull or crazed ,</l>
     <l n="337">And missed a chance to save her . We could find</l>
     <l n="338">That had he laid her down when she was stricken</l>
     <l n="339">She might have lived — I knew that much myself .</l>
     <l n="340">And we could find that had he never driven</l>
     <l n="341">This woman from his arms , but kept her there ,</l>
     <l n="342">Before said day of August 7th , no doubt</l>
     <l n="343">She had not died on August 7th . In short ,</l>
     <l n="344">He held her up , and should have laid her down ,</l>
     <l n="345">And drove her from him when she needed arms</l>
     <l n="346">To hold her up . And so we find her death</l>
     <l n="347">Was due to Barrett Bays — we censure him ,</l>
     <l n="348">Would hold him to the courts — that cannot be —</l>
     <l n="349">And so we hold him up for memory</l>
     <l n="350">Contemptuous , and say his bitter words</l>
     <l n="351">Brought on the syncope , so long prepared</l>
     <l n="352">By what he did . We write his course unfeeling ,</l>
     <l n="353">Weak , selfish , petty , flowing from the craze</l>
     <l n="354">Of sexual jealousy , made worse by war ,</l>
     <l n="355">And universal madness , erethism</l>
     <l n="356">Of hellish war . And , gentlemen , one thing :</l>
     <l n="357">Paul Robert 's article in the Dawn suggests</l>
     <l n="358">Some things I credit , knowing them . We get</l>
     <l n="359">Our notions of uncleanness from the Jews ,</l>
     <l n="360">The Pentateuch . There are no women here ,</l>
     <l n="361">And I can talk ;— you know the ancient Jews</l>
     <l n="362">Deemed sex unclean , and only to be touched</l>
     <l n="363">At sufferance of Jehovah ; birth unclean ,</l>
     <l n="364">A mother needing purification after</l>
     <l n="365">Her hour of giving birth . You know their laws</l>
     <l n="366">Concerning adultery . Well , they 've tainted us</l>
     <l n="367">In spite of Greece . Now look at Elenor Murray :</l>
     <l n="368">What if she went with Gregory Wenner . Hell !</l>
     <l n="369">Did that contaminate her , change her flesh ,</l>
     <l n="370">Or change her spirit ? All this evidence</l>
     <l n="371">Shows that it did not . But it changed this man ,</l>
     <l n="372">Because his mind was slime where snakes could breed .</l>
     <l n="373">But now what do we see ? That woman is</l>
     <l n="374">Essential genius , man just mechanism</l>
     <l n="375">Of conscious thought and strength . This Elenor</l>
     <l n="376">Is wiser , being nature , than this man ,</l>
     <l n="377">And lives a life that puts this Barrett Bays</l>
     <l n="378">To shame and laughter . Look at her : She 's brave ,</l>
     <l n="379">Devoted , loyal , true and dutiful ,</l>
     <l n="380">She 's will to life , and through it senses God ,</l>
     <l n="381">And seeks to serve the cosmic soul . I think</l>
     <l n="382">This jury should start now to raise a fund</l>
     <l n="383">To erect a statue of her in the park</l>
     <l n="384">To keep her name and labors fresh in mind</l>

     <l n="403">You may have congresses , and presidents ,</l>

     <l n="419">“ I like the words Llewellyn George has said .</l>

     <l n="430">Unhurt amid the storm-cloud , darkness , fire ,</l>
     <l n="431">To lives and eras . And our country too ,</l>
     <l n="432">So ruined and so weltering , like a ball</l>
     <l n="433">Of mud made in a missile by a god</l>
     <l n="434">May bear , no less , a pearl at core , a truth ,</l>
     <l n="435">A liberty , a genius , beauty ,— thrown</l>

     <l n="439">To be set in a precious time beyond</l>
     <l n="440">Our time and vision . This is what I mean :</l>

     <l n="444">It carries still the pearl of her , the seed</l>
     <l n="445">Of finer spirits . We must open eyes</l>
     <l n="446">To see inside the mud-ball . If it be</l>
     <l n="447">We conquered slavery of the negro through ,</l>
     <l n="448">Because of economic forces , yet</l>
     <l n="449">We conquered it . Trade , cotton , were the mud</l>
     <l n="450">Upon the whinchat 's claws containing seeds</l>

     <l n="452">In mid seas of the future to sunny isles ,</l>
     <l n="453">More blest than ours . And as for this , you know</l>
     <l n="454">The English blotted slavery from their books</l>
     <l n="455">And left their books unbalanced in point of cash ,</l>
     <l n="456">But balanced richly in a manhood gain .</l>
     <l n="457">I warn you , David Barrow , pessimist ,</l>
     <l n="458">Against a general slur on life and man .</l>
     <l n="459">Deride the Christian ethic , if you choose ,</l>
     <l n="460">You must retain its word of benevolence ;</l>
     <l n="461">Or better , you must honor man , whose heart</l>

     <l n="463">The Christian doctrine of benevolence</l>
     <l n="464">Did issue to this world . If Christian doctrine</l>
     <l n="465">Be man-made , not a miracle , as it is</l>
     <l n="466">All man-made , still it 's out of generous fire</l>

     <l n="468">Now how is Elenor Murray wonderful</l>
     <l n="469">To me viewed through this mass of evidence ?</l>

     <l n="471">All goodness , beauty , and benevolence ,</l>
     <l n="472">All aspiration , sacrifice , all death</l>
     <l n="473">For truth and liberty blesses life of us .</l>
     <l n="474">This soul maternal , passion to create</l>
     <l n="475">New life and guide it into happiness ,</l>
     <l n="476">Is Mother Mary of all tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="477">All charity , all vision , rises up</l>
     <l n="478">From its obscurity and primal force</l>
     <l n="479">Of romance , passion and the child , to realms ,</l>
     <l n="480">Democracies , republics ; never flags</l>
     <l n="481">To make them brighter , freer , so to spread</l>
     <l n="482">Its ecstasy to all , and take in turn</l>
     <l n="483">Redoubled ecstasy ! The tragedy</l>
     <l n="484">Is that this Elenor for her mother gift</l>
     <l n="485">Is cursed and tortured , sent a wanderer ;</l>
     <l n="486">And in her death must find much clinging mud</l>

     <l n="488">Which we have heard , around her , is it mud</l>
     <l n="489">That weights the soul of America , the pure</l>
     <l n="490">Dream of our founders ? Larger Athens , where</l>
     <l n="491">All things should be heard gladly and considered ,</l>
     <l n="492">And men should grow , be forced to grow , because</l>
     <l n="493">Not driven or restrained by usages ,</l>
     <l n="494">Or laws of mad majorities , but left</l>
     <l n="495">At their own peril to work out their lives ....</l>
     <l n="496">Well , gentlemen , I 'll tell you what I 've learned .</l>
     <l n="497">What is a man or woman but a sperm</l>
     <l n="498">Accreted into largeness ? Still a sperm</l>
     <l n="499">In likeness , being brain and spinal cord ,</l>
     <l n="500">Fed by the glands , the thyroid and the rest ,</l>
     <l n="501">Whose secrets we are ignorant of . We know</l>
     <l n="502">That when they fail our minds fail . But the glands</l>
     <l n="503">Are visible and clear : but in us whirl</l>
     <l n="504">Emotions ; fear , disgust , murder or wrath ,</l>
     <l n="505">Traced back to animals as moods of flight</l>
     <l n="506">Repulsion , curiosity , all the rest .</l>
     <l n="507">Now what are these but levers of our machine ?</l>
     <l n="508">Elenor Murray teaches this to me :</l>
     <l n="509">Build up a science of these levers , learn</l>
     <l n="510">To handle fear , disgust , anger , wonder .</l>
     <l n="511">They teach us physiology ; who teaches</l>
     <l n="512">The use of instincts and emotions , powers ?</l>
     <l n="513">All learning may be that , but what is that ?</l>
     <l n="514">Why just a spread of food , where after nibbling</l>
     <l n="515">You learn what you can eat , and what is good</l>
     <l n="516">For you to eat . You 'll see a different world</l>
     <l n="517">When this philosophy of levers rules . ” ...</l>
