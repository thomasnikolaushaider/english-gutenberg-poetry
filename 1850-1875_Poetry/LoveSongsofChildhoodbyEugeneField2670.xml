    <docTitle><titlePart>LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD By Eugene Field To Mrs. Belle Angler Dearest Aunt : Many years ago you used to rock me to sleep , cradling me in your arms and singing me petty songs . Surely you have not forgotten that time , and I recall it with tenderness . You were very beautiful then . But you are more beautiful now ; for , in the years that have come and gone since then , the joys and the sorrows of maternity have impressed their saintly grace upon the dear face I used to kiss , and have made your gentle heart gentler still .</titlePart></docTitle>
   </titlePage>
   <div type="dedication">
    <p>Beloved lady , in memory of years to be recalled only in thought , and in token of my gratitude and affection , I bring you these little love-songs , and reverently I lay them at your feet .</p>

       <l n="2">The Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street</l>
       <l n="3">Comes stealing ; comes creeping ;</l>

       <l n="5">And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleet —</l>
       <l n="6">She bringeth her poppies to you , my sweet ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">There is one little dream of a beautiful drum —</l>
       <l n="9">“ Rub-a-dub ! ” it goeth ;</l>
       <l n="10">There is one little dream of a big sugar-plum ,</l>
       <l n="11">And lo ! thick and fast the other dreams come</l>
       <l n="12">Of popguns that bang , and tin tops that hum ,</l>
       <l n="13">And a trumpet that bloweth !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams</l>
       <l n="15">With laughter and singing ;</l>
       <l n="16">And boats go a-floating on silvery streams ,</l>
       <l n="17">And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty gleams ,</l>
       <l n="18">And up , up , and up , where the Mother Moon beams ,</l>
       <l n="19">The fairies go winging !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="20">Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny and fleet ?</l>
       <l n="21">They 'll come to you sleeping ;</l>
       <l n="22">So shut the two eyes that are weary , my sweet ,</l>
       <l n="23">For the Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street ,</l>
       <l n="24">With poppies that hang from her head to her feet ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="27">On afternoons , when baby boy has had a splendid nap ,</l>
       <l n="28">And sits , like any monarch on his throne , in nurse 's lap ,</l>
       <l n="29">In some such wise my handkerchief I hold before my face ,</l>
       <l n="30">And cautiously and quietly I move about the place ;</l>
       <l n="31">Then , with a cry , I suddenly expose my face to view ,</l>
       <l n="32">And you should hear him laugh and crow when I say “ Booh ” !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="33">Sometimes the rascal tries to make believe that he is scared ,</l>
       <l n="34">And really , when I first began , he stared , and stared , and stared ;</l>
       <l n="35">And then his under lip came out and farther out it came ,</l>
       <l n="36">Till mamma and the nurse agreed it was a “ cruel shame ” —</l>
       <l n="37">But now what does that same wee , toddling , lisping baby do</l>
       <l n="38">But laugh and kick his little heels when I say “ Booh ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="39">He laughs and kicks his little heels in rapturous glee , and then</l>
       <l n="40">In shrill , despotic treble bids me “ do it all aden ! ”</l>
       <l n="41">And I — of course I do it ; for , as his progenitor ,</l>
       <l n="42">It is such pretty , pleasant play as this that I am for !</l>
       <l n="43">And it is , oh , such fun I and sure that we shall rue</l>
       <l n="44">The time when we are both too old to play the game “ Booh ! ”</l>

       <l n="1">Have you ever heard the wind go “ Yooooo ” ?</l>
       <l n="2">‘ T is a pitiful sound to hear !</l>
       <l n="3">It seems to chill you through and through</l>
       <l n="4">With a strange and speechless fear .</l>
       <l n="5">‘ T is the voice of the night that broods outside</l>
       <l n="6">When folk should be asleep ,</l>

       <l n="8">To the darkness brooding far and wide</l>
       <l n="9">Over the land and the deep :</l>
       <l n="10">“ Whom do you want , O lonely night ,</l>
       <l n="11">That you wail the long hours through ? ”</l>
       <l n="12">And the night would say in its ghostly way :</l>

       <l n="18">That when the night went wailing so ,</l>
       <l n="19">Somebody had been bad ;</l>
       <l n="20">And then , when I was snug in bed ,</l>
       <l n="21">Whither I had been sent ,</l>
       <l n="22">With the blankets pulled up round my head ,</l>
       <l n="23">I 'd think of what my mother 'd said ,</l>
       <l n="24">And wonder what boy she meant !</l>
       <l n="25">And “ Who 's been bad to-day ? ” I 'd ask</l>
       <l n="26">Of the wind that hoarsely blew ,</l>
       <l n="27">And the voice would say in its meaningful way :</l>
       <l n="28">“ Yoooooooo !</l>

       <l n="39">From mother and the rest —</l>
       <l n="40">Suppose you ask , “ Who has been bad ? ”</l>

       <l n="2">There once was a bird that lived up in a tree ,</l>
       <l n="3">And all he could whistle was “ Fiddle-dee-dee ” —</l>
       <l n="4">A very provoking , unmusical song</l>
       <l n="5">For one to be whistling the summer day long !</l>
       <l n="6">Yet always contented and busy was he</l>
       <l n="7">With that vocal recurrence of “ Fiddle-dee-dee . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">Hard by lived a brave little soldier of four ,</l>
       <l n="9">That weird iteration repented him sore ;</l>
       <l n="10">“ I prithee , Dear-Mother-Mine ! fetch me my gun ,</l>
       <l n="11">For , by our St. Didy ! the deed must be done</l>
       <l n="12">That shall presently rid all creation and me</l>
       <l n="13">Of that ominous bird and his ‘ Fiddle-dee-dee ’ ! ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">Then out came Dear-Mother-Mine , bringing her son</l>
       <l n="15">His awfully truculent little red gun ;</l>
       <l n="16">The stock was of pine and the barrel of tin ,</l>
       <l n="17">The “ bang ” it came out where the bullet went in —</l>
       <l n="18">The right kind of weapon I think you 'll agree</l>
       <l n="19">For slaying all fowl that go “ Fiddle-dee-dee ” !</l>

       <l n="23">The gun it went off with a terrible bang !</l>
       <l n="24">Then loud laughed the youth — “ By my Bottle , ” cried he ,</l>
       <l n="25">“ I 've put a quietus on ‘ Fiddle-dee-dee ’ ! ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Out came then Dear-Mother-Mine , saying : “ My son ,</l>

       <l n="28">Hereafter no evil at all need I fear ,</l>
       <l n="29">With such a brave soldier as You-My-Love here ! ”</l>
       <l n="30">She kissed the dear boy .</l>

       <l n="32">Continued to whistle his “ Fiddle-dee-dee ” )</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Over the hills and far away ,</l>
       <l n="2">A little boy steals from his morning play</l>
       <l n="3">And under the blossoming apple-tree</l>
       <l n="4">He lies and he dreams of the things to be :</l>
       <l n="5">Of battles fought and of victories won ,</l>
       <l n="6">Of wrongs o'erthrown and of great deeds done —</l>
       <l n="7">Of the valor that he shall prove some day ,</l>
       <l n="8">Over the hills and far away —</l>
       <l n="9">Over the hills , and far away !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">Over the hills and far away</l>
       <l n="11">It 's , oh , for the toil the livelong day !</l>
       <l n="12">But it mattereth not to the soul aflame</l>
       <l n="13">With a love for riches and power and fame !</l>
       <l n="14">On , O man ! while the sun is high —</l>
       <l n="15">On to the certain joys that lie</l>
       <l n="16">Yonder where blazeth the noon of day ,</l>
       <l n="17">Over the hills and far away —</l>
       <l n="18">Over the hills , and far away !</l>

       <l n="21">Now that his journey is almost done ,</l>
       <l n="22">His battles fought and his victories won —</l>
       <l n="23">The old-time honesty and truth ,</l>
       <l n="24">The trustfulness and the friends of youth ,</l>
       <l n="25">Home and mother-where are they ?</l>
       <l n="26">Over the hills and far away —</l>
       <l n="27">Over the years , and far away !</l>
