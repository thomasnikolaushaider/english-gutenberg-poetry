    <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS BY JOHN L. STODDARD</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate><date>1913</date>CONJUGI CARISSIMAE PROEM They called him mad ,— the poor , old man , Whose white hair , worn and thin , Fell o'er his shoulders , as he played His cherished violin , Forever drawing to and fro O'er silent strings a loosened bow . At times on his pathetic face A look of perfect rapture shone , Intent on some celestial chords , Discerned by him alone ; And sometimes he would smile and pause , As if receiving loud applause . So , many a humble poet dreams His songs will touch the human heart , And full of hope his offering lays Before the shrine of Art ; Poor dreamer , may he never know That he too draws a silent bow !</docDate>

     <item>MY “ PROMENADE SOLITAIRE ”</item>
     <item>Up and down in my garden fair , Under the trellis where grapes will bloom , With the breath of violets in the air , As pallid Winter for Spring makes room , I walk and ponder , free from care , In my beautiful Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>Back and forth in the checkered shade Traced by the lattice that holds the vine , With the glory of snow-capped crests displayed On the sapphire sky in a billowy line , I stroll , and ask what can compare With the charm of my Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>To and fro ‘ neath the nascent green Which clambers over its slender frame , With white peaks lighting up the scene , As snowfields glow with the sunset flame , I saunter , halting here and there For the view from my Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>In and out through the silence sweet , Plash of fountain and song of bird Are the only sounds in my lov 'd retreat By which the air is ever stirred ; It is like a long-drawn aisle of prayer , So hushed is my Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>Onward rushes the world without , But the breeze which over my garden steals Brings from it merely a distant shout Or the echo light of passing wheels ; In its din and drive I have now no share , As I muse in my Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>Am I dead to the world , that I thus disdain Its moil and toil in the prime of life , When perhaps a score of years remain To win more gold in its selfish strife ? Am I foolish to choose the purer air Of my glorious Promenade Solitaire ?</item>
     <item>Ah no ! From my mountain-girdled height I watch the game of the world go on , And note the course of the bitter fight , And what is lost and what is won ; And I judge of it better here than there , As I gaze from my Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>It is ever the same old tale of greed , Of robbing and killing the weaker race , Of the word proved false by the cruel deed , Of the slanderous tongue with the friendly face ; ‘ Tis enough to make one 's heart despair Even here in my Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>They cheer , and struggle , and beat the air With many a stroke and thrust intense , And urge each other to do and dare , To gain some good they deem immense ; But they look like ants contending there From the height of my Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>Backward and forward they run and crawl , Houses and treasures they heap up high , Hither and thither their booty haul , ... Then suddenly drop in their tracks and die ! For few are wise enough to repair In time to a Promenade Solitaire .</item>
     <item>Meantime the Earth speeds on through space , As the sun for a million years hath steered , And , an eon hence , the entire race Will have played its part and disappeared ; But what will the lifeless planet care , As it follows its Promenade Solitaire ?</item>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">O pallid spectre of the midnight skies ,</l>
       <l n="2">Whose phantom features in the dome of Night</l>
       <l n="3">Elude the keenest gaze of wistful eyes ,</l>
       <l n="4">Till amplest lenses aid the failing sight ;</l>
       <l n="5">On heaven 's blue sea the farthest isle of fire ,</l>

       <l n="10">In myriad suns that constellations frame ,</l>
       <l n="11">Around which life-blest satellites revolve ,</l>
       <l n="12">Like those unnumbered orbs which nightly creep</l>
       <l n="13">In dim procession o'er the azure steep ,</l>

       <l n="18">As to and fro its fiery billows surge ?</l>
       <l n="19">Whose glowing atoms , whirled in ceaseless strife ,</l>
       <l n="20">Where now chaotic anarchy is rife ,</l>

       <l n="31">Can ne'er escape in its majestic might</l>
       <l n="32">The firm control of omnipresent law ;</l>
       <l n="33">This mote descending to its bounden place ,</l>

      <head>ORIENT TO OCCIDENT , 1906</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">You thought me sunk in lethargy , too deeply drugged with sleep</l>
       <l n="2">To notice how your armored fleets kept creeping o'er the deep ,</l>
       <l n="3">Too indolent to organize , too feeble to resist ,</l>
       <l n="4">Too timid to return the blow of Europe 's mailèd fist ;</l>
       <l n="5">And Asia 's conquest seemed to you a matter of such ease</l>
       <l n="6">That all your kings knew perfectly the part which each would seize .</l>
       <l n="7">Of such a “ sluggish , inert mass ” why should you be afraid ?</l>
       <l n="8">You wanted ports and provinces for purposes of trade ,</l>
       <l n="9">And monster “ spheres of influence ” , whose wealth could be controlled</l>
       <l n="10">And plundered by your Governments to fill their vaults with gold ;</l>
       <l n="11">Hence , since it seemed so probable that none of us would fight ,</l>
       <l n="12">Why should you even hesitate to prove that Might makes Right ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="13">And yet perhaps it had been well , before you formed your plan ,</l>
       <l n="14">To study Asia 's history from Persia to Japan ;</l>
       <l n="15">For though the sleeping Orient , like grain before the blast ,</l>
       <l n="16">May bow its head , it rights itself when once the storm is past .</l>
       <l n="17">How often has the Occident invaded our domains</l>
       <l n="18">And boasted of its victories ! Yet of them what remains ?</l>
       <l n="19">Seems India exceptional ? Fools , judge not by a day !</l>
       <l n="20">The horologe of centuries moves slowly in Cathay .</l>
       <l n="21">The brilliant son of Macedon saw , crushed and pale with fear ,</l>
       <l n="22">The vanquished East from Babylon to Egypt and Cashmere ;</l>
       <l n="23">But though the conquered Orient lay helpless , as his slave ,</l>
       <l n="24">Of Alexander 's influence how much survived his grave ?</l>
       <l n="25">Of Rome 's prodigious armaments , to Asian conquests led ,</l>
       <l n="26">Where is there now a souvenir save relics of the dead ?</l>
       <l n="27">And of the vast Crusading hosts , which in their madness rose</l>
       <l n="28">And hurled themselves repeatedly upon their Moslem foes ,—</l>
       <l n="29">What is to-day the net result ? A thousand years have passed ,</l>
       <l n="30">But none of all their vaunted gains proved great enough to last ;</l>
       <l n="31">The Saviour 's tomb , Jerusalem , and all the sacred lands</l>
       <l n="32">Connected with the Christian faith are still in Asian hands !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="33">We needed rude awakening to rouse us from our sloth ;</l>
       <l n="34">It came among our northern isles , whose heroes , nothing loth ,</l>
       <l n="35">Unbarred their ports to modern fleets , their ancient life forswore ,</l>
       <l n="36">And learned from greedy foreigners the Christians ’ art of war .</l>
       <l n="37">Behold ! the world in fifty years is breathless with surprise ,</l>
       <l n="38">And Europe 's greatest Government has sought us for allies !</l>
       <l n="39">That little section of our mass aroused itself , and lo !</l>
       <l n="40">Your largest Occidental Power has reeled beneath the blow ;</l>
       <l n="41">And while our living troops receive men 's rapturous acclaim ,</l>
       <l n="42">Our fallen heroes have attained the Pantheon of fame .</l>
       <l n="43">Yet think not we deceive ourselves ; you praise , but really dread</l>
       <l n="44">The valour of the Orient , if this awakening spread ;</l>
       <l n="45">Behind this movement of the East you think you hear the low ,</l>
       <l n="46">Long murmur of the Asians ,— “ The foreigner must go ” !</l>
       <l n="47">What wonder that we hate you all ? You look on us to-day</l>
       <l n="48">As lions look on antelopes ,— their heaven-appointed prey ;</l>
       <l n="49">You know you have no lawful right to lands that you possess ;</l>
       <l n="50">You gained them all through violence , or lying and finesse ;</l>
       <l n="51">Your cursed opium alone , despite our prayers and tears ,</l>
       <l n="52">Has ruined millions of our race for more than two score years ,</l>
       <l n="53">And when we rose indignantly to right that bitter wrong ,</l>
       <l n="54">Your heavy guns bombarded us , and you annexed ... Hong Kong !</l>
       <l n="55">You force yourselves on us , and ask concessions , favors , mines ,</l>
       <l n="56">Protection for your mission schools , and grants of railway lines ,</l>
       <l n="57">But when we cross the seas to you , an entry you refuse ,</l>
       <l n="58">And curse , illtreat , and harry us with loathing and abuse .</l>
       <l n="59">Japan has shown the only way of keeping for our own</l>
       <l n="60">The fertile fields which rightfully belong to us alone ;</l>
       <l n="61">We do not wish to arm ourselves , and fighting we abhor ,</l>
       <l n="62">But self-protection forces us to learn and practise war .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="63">Hence , if assailed , we shall not shun a struggle with the West ;</l>
       <l n="64">Not bent on conquest , like yourselves , but , rising to the test</l>
       <l n="65">Of “ Asia for the Asians ” , defend our threatened farms</l>
       <l n="66">By sending to encounter you a million men in arms .</l>
       <l n="67">You think yourselves invincible ? Learn something from Japan ,</l>
       <l n="68">The fever of whose chivalry now spreads from man to man ,</l>
       <l n="69">Encouraging the Orient to hasten on the day</l>
       <l n="70">When all enlightened Asians shall cry “ Enough ! Away !</l>
       <l n="71">Go exploit helpless Africa , where you have shamed the beast ,</l>
       <l n="72">But understand , your cruel day is over in the East ! ”</l>
       <l n="73">You still have many things to learn , base worshippers of gold ;</l>
       <l n="74">When you were wild barbarians , our Governments were old !</l>
       <l n="75">Your self-conceit and arrogance we therefore laugh to scorn ;</l>
       <l n="76">We had our laws millenniums before your courts were born .</l>
       <l n="77">You talk by electricity , you ride on wings of steam ,</l>
       <l n="78">You thunder with machinery ,— and these you proudly deem</l>
       <l n="79">The grandest triumphs of the race , forgetting that mere speed</l>
       <l n="80">In transference of men and things is less than one great deed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="81">You treat us condescendingly , as if our gifts were small ,</l>
       <l n="82">But do you think Almighty God has dowered you with all ?</l>
       <l n="83">Earth 's greatest continent is ours ; her highest mountains rise</l>
       <l n="84">In unapproached sublimity beneath our starry skies ;</l>
       <l n="85">Ours , too , the cradle of the race ; and at our Buddha 's shrine</l>
       <l n="86">Unequalled numbers of mankind adore him as divine .</l>
       <l n="87">How dare you speak of Asian thought with pity or a sneer ,</l>
       <l n="88">When practically all you know originated here ?</l>
       <l n="89">What had you been , if our ideals , in art and faith expressed ,</l>
       <l n="90">Had not come down through Greece and Rome to civilize your West ?</l>
       <l n="91">The great religions of the world are all of Asian birth ,</l>
       <l n="92">And thence went forth resistlessly to dominate the earth .</l>
       <l n="93">Of six we granted one to you ; and you profess its creeds ,</l>
       <l n="94">But what a sorry travesty you make of it in deeds !</l>
       <l n="95">The Christ taught love to enemies ; His followers to-day</l>
       <l n="96">Have trained the whole male Christian world their fellow men to slay !</l>
       <l n="97">The very Bible that you prize was writ by Asian hands ;</l>
       <l n="98">Your prophets , saints , and patriarchs were all of Eastern lands ;</l>
       <l n="99">The Son of God , as you believe , was born a humble Jew ;</l>
       <l n="100">The Virgin Mother equally no other parents knew ;</l>
       <l n="101">Yet you have robbed and tortured Jews , and murdered them at will</l>
       <l n="102">Through eighteen Christian centuries ,— are killing thousands still !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="103">The “ Star of Empire , ” as you claim , has “ westward ” made its way ;</l>
       <l n="104">But what if now in Eastern skies it heralds a new day ?</l>
       <l n="105">You fondly dreamed its brilliant course had ended there with you ,</l>
       <l n="106">But on it moves , old lands to greet , and belt the globe anew !</l>
       <l n="107">Its kindling rays revivify our nations , which have slept</l>
       <l n="108">While round the world our influence through you has slowly crept .</l>
       <l n="109">The coming century 's great deeds lie not at Europe 's doors ;</l>
       <l n="110">A grander stage awaits mankind ,— the vast Pacific 's shores ;</l>
       <l n="111">And we not only skirt that sea from Tokyo to Saigon ,</l>
       <l n="112">Our coastline fronts the western world from Syria to Ceylon !</l>
       <l n="113">Again shall we supply to you the part of life you need ;</l>
       <l n="114">Again your slaves of strenuous toil shall live at slower speed ;</l>
       <l n="115">Once more , as pilgrims to a shrine , your chiefs shall come to me ,</l>
       <l n="116">And learn of my philosophy , as children at my knee .</l>
       <l n="117">You cannot cut me from your past , nor cancel what you owe</l>
       <l n="118">For all my sages gave to you two thousand years ago ;</l>
       <l n="119">For after twenty centuries you think , and speak , and pray</l>
       <l n="120">Still much as I instructed you in Syria and Cathay .</l>
       <l n="121">Keep you , then , the material , I hold the mental , realm ;</l>
       <l n="122">For you the ship 's machinery , for me the guiding helm !</l>

      <head>PROLOGUE</head>
      <head>Oswald von Wolkenstein , the Last of the Minnesingers , loved a beautiful woman , named Sabina , who proved faithless to him , thereby causing the poet great mental suffering . He avenged his wrongs by writing poems on her coquetry and cruelty . Years later , Sabina , who had never forgiven him his satirical verses , became the favorite of the Tyrolese prince , “ Frederick , of the Empty Purse ” , who also hated Oswald for opposing his political plans . Accordingly , Sabina plotted with her lover to induce the poet to come to her under a pretence of renewing their former love . To effect this , she wrote him a letter expressing her undying affection for him , and begging him to meet her near Meran . The plot was successful , and Oswald fell completely into their power . By Frederick 's orders he was at once imprisoned in the dungeon of Schloss Forst , and subjected to tortures which crippled him for the rest of his life .</head>

       <l n="4">A brilliant , uniformed cortège whose music fills the air ;</l>
       <l n="5">For such a gorgeous spectacle is not seen every day ;</l>
       <l n="6">It gives the town a festival to view the fine array ;</l>
       <l n="7">All hearts are filled with happiness , and no one seems to lag ,</l>
       <l n="8">When he has thus a chance to see the soldiers ... and the flag .</l>
       <l n="9">The old retired officers , their hats like helmets worn ,</l>
       <l n="10">Have thrust them gaily on one side at sound of drum and horn ;</l>
       <l n="11">The eldest , whose brave heart is stirred by that familiar strain ,</l>
       <l n="12">Surmounts , with stifled sigh , his chair , a better view to gain ;</l>
       <l n="13">Cafes , salons , mansards alike their windows open throw ,</l>
       <l n="14">And pretty girls wear radiant smiles to greet the passing show .</l>
       <l n="15">Ah , here they are ! Yes , here they come ! preceded by the boys ,</l>
       <l n="16">Who imitate in fashion droll , yet with no actual noise ,</l>
       <l n="17">But merely by the gesturing of finger or of hand ,</l>
       <l n="18">The cymbals , flute , and ( best of all ) the trombones of the band .</l>
       <l n="19">The babies even laugh and crow , upheld in nurses ’ arms ,</l>
       <l n="20">And have no fear of trumpets loud , or the bass-drum 's alarms .</l>
       <l n="21">The pavement of the boulevard is struck in perfect time ;</l>
       <l n="22">Six hundred echoes blend in one , and make the scene sublime ;</l>
       <l n="23">Six hundred hearts are throbbing there , imbued with martial pride ;</l>
       <l n="24">Twelve hundred feet with rhythmic beat make but a single stride .</l>
       <l n="25">United , too , are all the hearts of those whose eyes pursue</l>
       <l n="26">With admiration every line now passing in review .</l>
       <l n="27">But when a gallant regiment appears thus on parade ,</l>
       <l n="28">A little vain of its fine looks , and conscious of its grade ,</l>
       <l n="29">Each soldier , ( since a time of peace allows him to be gay ) ,</l>
       <l n="30">Aspires to be attentive to the ladies on the way ,</l>
       <l n="31">And stares at every pretty face , with no wish to be rude ,</l>
       <l n="32">But , then , you know , a regiment is never quite ... a prude !</l>
       <l n="33">And this explains why Captain Short has said to Captain Tall ,</l>

       <l n="37">Then both a little thoughtfully move on with some regret ,</l>

       <l n="41">More than one mounted officer , with flashing sabre , wheels</l>
       <l n="42">His well-groomed horse , and calls to him the sergeant at his heels ;</l>
       <l n="43">And makes excuse of some detail , endeavoring the while ,</l>
       <l n="44">Perhaps half consciously , to win the favor of a smile .</l>
       <l n="45">In vain ; the glance he hopes to gain , as hero of her heart ,</l>
       <l n="46">Comes not ; but rank forbids delay , he must at once depart .</l>

       <l n="50">From clanking spur to epaulette with stars and golden lines ;</l>
       <l n="51">He knows how potent is the spell such ornaments impart</l>
       <l n="52">To make of soldiers demi-gods in woman 's gentle heart .</l>
       <l n="53">“ The Flag ! The Flag ! ” The crowd is thrilled to see it now advance !</l>
       <l n="54">Hail , Colors of the Fatherland ! Hail , Banner of Fair France !</l>
       <l n="55">Hail , wounded emblem of the brave ; blood-red , and heaven 's blue ,</l>

       <l n="59">The color-bearer , young as Hope , and still a charming boy ,</l>
       <l n="60">In rhythm to the beating hearts and symphony of joy ,</l>

       <l n="65">And that its presence lifts him high above the rank and file ,</l>
       <l n="66">And gains for him a sentiment worth many a pretty smile .</l>

       <l n="68">“ It is the bearer of the flag , on whom her favor fell ” ,</l>
       <l n="69">Exclaims the Captain , who then adds , “ Great Heavens ! worse than this ,</l>

      <head>EMILY 'S GRAVE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Idly one day in a foreign town</l>
       <l n="2">In a churchyard 's shade I sat me down</l>
       <l n="3">By the side of a little cross of stone</l>
       <l n="4">On which was a woman 's name alone .</l>
       <l n="5">A cypress whispered in my ear</l>
       <l n="6">That all was now neglected here ;</l>
       <l n="7">“ Emily 's Grave ” was all I read ;</l>
       <l n="8">Nothing more on the cross was said ;</l>
       <l n="9">Neither a name , nor Bible verse ,</l>
       <l n="10">Nor date relieved the inscription terse ,—</l>
       <l n="11">“ Emily 's Grave ” .</l>
       <l n="12">So strange this seemed , my blood turned cold</l>
       <l n="13">At thought of a tragedy never told .</l>
       <l n="14">The flowers , the grass , and the humming bees</l>
       <l n="15">Were blithe and gay in the sun and breeze ,</l>
       <l n="16">Yet no kind hand had ever strewn</l>
       <l n="17">Sweet flowers , where only weeds had grown ,</l>
       <l n="18">And nothing brightened the lonely mound</l>
       <l n="19">Whose edge was lost in the trodden ground .</l>
       <l n="20">At length to the churchyard gate I went ,</l>
       <l n="21">And asked of a woman old and bent ,</l>
       <l n="22">“ Who was the girl , whose cross of stone</l>
       <l n="23">Bears nothing save these words alone ,—</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Emily 's Grave ’ ? ”</l>
       <l n="25">“ Alas ! ” she answered , “ many a year</l>
       <l n="26">Hath passed since I beheld her bier ;</l>
       <l n="27">She was young , and came from a humble nest ,</l>
       <l n="28">And credulous too , like all the rest ;</l>
       <l n="29">So a stranger met her here one day</l>
       <l n="30">And caught her in his net straightway .</l>
       <l n="31">He said he was rich , and she should shine</l>
       <l n="32">Like a queen in his castle by the Rhine ,</l>
       <l n="33">And , winning her love , he took her hence</l>
       <l n="34">To where she found it was all pretence .</l>
       <l n="35">He had basely lied to the simple maid ,</l>
       <l n="36">And , wearying soon of a girl betrayed ,</l>
       <l n="37">Abandoned her ; then home once more</l>
       <l n="38">She came , to sink at her mother 's door .</l>
       <l n="39">Of shame and grief she was quickly dead ,</l>
       <l n="40">For here she could no more lift her head ;</l>

       <l n="42">All memory of her child 's disgrace ,</l>
       <l n="43">Reared that small cross , to which she gave</l>
