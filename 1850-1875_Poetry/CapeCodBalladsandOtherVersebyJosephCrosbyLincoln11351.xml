    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="1">A friend has objected to the title of this book on the ground that , as many of the characters and scenes described are to be found in almost any coast village of the United States , the title might , with equal fitness , be “ New Jersey Ballads , ” or “ Long Island Ballads , ” or something similar .</p>
    <p n="2">The answer to this is , simply , that while “ School-committee Men ” and “ Village Oracles ” are , doubtless , pretty much alike throughout Yankeedom , the particular specimens here dealt with were individuals whom the author knew in his boyhood “ down on the Cape . ” So , “ Cape Cod Ballads ” it is .</p>
    <p n="3">The verses in this collection originally appeared in Harper 's Weekly , The Youth 's Companion , The Saturday Evening Post , Puck , Types , The League of American Wheelmen Bulletin , and the publications of the American Press Association . Thanks are due to the editors of these periodicals for their courteous permission to reprint .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Where leap the long Atlantic swells</l>
       <l n="2">In foam-streaked stretch of hill and dale ,</l>
       <l n="3">Where shrill the north-wind demon yells ,</l>
       <l n="4">And flings the spindrift down the gale ;</l>
       <l n="5">Where , beaten ‘ gainst the bending mast ,</l>
       <l n="6">The frozen raindrop clings and cleaves ,</l>
       <l n="7">With steadfast front for calm or blast</l>

       <l n="13">The dripping deck beneath him reels ,</l>

       <l n="17">The grim white sea-fog o'er him throws</l>

       <l n="1">Oh , the song of the Sea —</l>
       <l n="2">The wonderful song of the Sea !</l>
       <l n="3">Like the far-off hum of a throbbing drum</l>
       <l n="4">It steals through the night to me :</l>
       <l n="5">And my fancy wanders free</l>
       <l n="6">To a little seaport town ,</l>
       <l n="7">And a spot I knew , where the roses grew</l>
       <l n="8">By a cottage small and brown ;</l>
       <l n="9">And a child strayed up and down</l>
       <l n="10">O'er hillock and beach and lea ,</l>
       <l n="11">And crept at dark to his bed , to hark</l>
       <l n="12">To the wonderful song of the Sea .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="13">Oh , the song of the Sea —</l>

       <l n="16">That music was wont to be !</l>
       <l n="17">And the night-wind through the tree</l>
       <l n="18">Was a perfumed breath that told</l>
       <l n="19">Of the spicy gales that filled the sails</l>
       <l n="20">Where the tropic billows rolled</l>
       <l n="21">And the rovers hid their gold</l>
       <l n="22">By the lone palm on the key ,—</l>
       <l n="23">But the whispering wave their secret gave</l>
       <l n="24">In the mystical song of the Sea .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="25">Oh , the song of the Sea —</l>
       <l n="26">The beautiful song of the Sea !</l>
       <l n="27">The mighty note from the ocean 's throat ,</l>
       <l n="28">The laugh of the wind in glee !</l>
       <l n="29">And swift as the ripples flee</l>
       <l n="30">With the surges down the shore ,</l>
       <l n="31">It bears me back , o'er life 's long track ,</l>
       <l n="32">To home and its love once more .</l>
       <l n="33">I stand at the open door ,</l>
       <l n="34">Dear mother , again with thee ,</l>

       <l n="7">Seeming skeletons in air ,</l>
       <l n="8">Battered branches , brown and bare ,</l>
       <l n="9">Gauntly grinned ;</l>
       <l n="10">And the frightened dust-clouds , flying .</l>

       <l n="31">And it sang ,</l>
       <l n="32">Light and low , that mother 's song ;</l>
       <l n="33">And the master , staunch and strong ,</l>
       <l n="34">Heard the sweet strain drift along —</l>
       <l n="35">Softened , thinned ,—</l>
       <l n="36">Heard the tightened cordage ringing</l>

       <l n="1">A solemn Sabbath stillness lies along the Mudville lanes ,</l>
       <l n="2">Among the crags of Shantytown a peaceful quiet reigns ,</l>
       <l n="3">For down upon McCarty 's dump , in fiery fight for fame ,</l>
       <l n="4">The Shanties meet the Mudvilles in the final pennant game ;</l>
       <l n="5">And heedless of the frantic fray , in center field remote ,</l>
       <l n="6">Behind the biggest ash-heap lies O'Reilly ' s billy-goat .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">The eager crowd bends forward now , in fierce excitement 's thrall ,</l>
       <l n="8">The pitcher writhes in serpent twist , the umpire says , “ Play ball ! ”</l>
       <l n="9">The batsman swings with sudden spite ,— a loud , resounding “ spat , ”</l>
       <l n="10">And hissing through the ambient air the horse-hide leaves the bat ;</l>
       <l n="11">With one terrific battle-cry , the “ rooter ” clears his throat ,</l>
       <l n="12">But still serene in slumber lies O'Reilly ' s billy-goat .</l>

       <l n="15">With one half inning still to play the score is three to two ,</l>

       <l n="17">Bold Captain Muggsy comes to bat , a batsman he of note ,</l>

       <l n="21">He notes the center-fielder 's garb , the Mudvilles ’ shirt of red ;</l>
       <l n="22">He firmly plants his sturdy legs , he bows his horned head ,</l>
       <l n="23">And , as upon his shaggy ears the Mudville slogan smote ,</l>

       <l n="27">The Mudville center-fielder smiles and reaches forth in glee ,</l>
       <l n="28">He knows that fly 's an easy out for such a man as he .</l>

       <l n="31">Across the battle-field is borne a dull and muffled sound ,</l>
       <l n="32">The fielder like a bullock falls , the ball rolls on the ground .</l>
       <l n="33">Around the bases on the wing the gallant Muggsy speeds ,</l>
       <l n="34">And follows swiftly in the track where fast his comrade leads .</l>
       <l n="35">And from the field of chaos where the dusty billows float ,</l>
       <l n="36">With calm , majestic mien there stalks O'Reilly ' s billy-goat .</l>

       <l n="37">Above the crags of Shantytown the flaunting pennant waves ,</l>

       <l n="39">The children shout in gladsome glee , each fair one waves her hand ,</l>
       <l n="40">As down the street the heroes march with lively German band ;</l>
       <l n="41">But wilder grows the tumult when , with ribboned horns and coat ,</l>
       <l n="42">They see , on high in triumph borne , O'Reilly ' s billy-goat .</l>

       <l n="1">Oh , those sweet old-fashioned posies , that were mother 's pride and joy ,</l>
       <l n="2">In the sunny little garden where I wandered when a boy !</l>
       <l n="3">Oh , the morning-glories twining ‘ mongst the shining sunflowers tall ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the clematis a-tangle in the angle of the wall !</l>
       <l n="5">How the mignonette 's sweet blooming was perfuming all the walks ,</l>
       <l n="6">Where the hollyhocks stood proudly with their blossom-dotted stalks ;</l>
       <l n="7">While the old-maids ’ pinks were nodding groups of gossips , here and there ,</l>
       <l n="8">And the bluebells swung so lightly in the lazy , hazy air !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Then the sleepy poppies , stooping low their drooping , drowsy heads ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the modest young sweet-williams hiding in their shady beds !</l>
       <l n="11">By the edges of the hedges , where the spiders ’ webs were spun ,</l>
       <l n="12">How the marigolds lay , yellow as the mellow summer sun</l>
       <l n="13">That made all the grass a-dapple ‘ neath the leafy apple tree ,</l>
       <l n="14">Whence you heard the locust drumming and the humming of the bee ;</l>
       <l n="15">While the soft breeze in the trellis , where the roses used to grow ,</l>
       <l n="16">Sent the silken petals flying like a scented shower of snow !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">Oh , the quaint old-fashioned garden , and the pathways cool and sweet ,</l>
       <l n="18">With the dewy branches splashing flashing jewels o'er my feet !</l>
       <l n="19">And the dear old-fashioned blossoms , and the old home where they grew ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the mother-hands that plucked them , and the mother-love I knew !</l>
       <l n="21">Ah , of all earth 's fragrant flowers in the bowers on her breast ,</l>
       <l n="22">Sure the blooms which memory brings us are the brightest and the best ;</l>
       <l n="23">And the fairest , rarest blossoms ne'er could win my love , I know ,</l>
       <l n="24">Like the sweet old-fashioned posies mother tended long ago .</l>

       <l n="2">For years the surge has tossed its kelp and wrack about my door ;</l>
       <l n="3">I 've heard the sea-wind sing its song in whispers ‘ round the place ,</l>
       <l n="4">And fought it when it flung the sand , like needles , in my face .</l>
       <l n="5">I 've seen the sun-rays turn the roof ter blist'rin ’ , tarry coal ;</l>
       <l n="6">I 've seen the ice-drift clog the bay from foamin ’ shoal ter shoal ;</l>
       <l n="7">I 've faced the winter 's snow and sleet , I 've felt the summer 's shower ,</l>
       <l n="8">But every night I 've lit the lamp up yonder in the tower .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">I 've seen the sunset flood the earth with streams of rosy light ,</l>

       <l n="11">I 've woke ter find the sky a mess of scud and smoky wreath ,</l>
       <l n="12">A blind wind-devil overhead and hell let loose beneath .</l>
       <l n="13">And then ter watch the rollers pound on ledges , bars and rips ,</l>
       <l n="14">And pray fer them that go , O Lord , down ter the sea in ships !</l>
       <l n="15">Ter see the lamp , when darkness comes , throw out its shinin ’ track ,</l>
       <l n="16">And think of that one gleamin ’ speck in all the world of black .</l>

       <l n="19">And often , through a night like that , I 've waited fer the day</l>
       <l n="20">That broke and showed a lonesome sea , a sky all cold and gray ;</l>
       <l n="21">And , may be , on the spit below , where sea-gulls whirl and screech ,</l>
       <l n="22">I 've seen a somethin ’ stretched among the fresh weed on the beach ;</l>
       <l n="23">A draggled , frozen somethin ’ , in the ocean 's tangled scum ,</l>
       <l n="24">That meant a woman waitin ’ fer a man who 'd never come ;</l>
       <l n="25">And all the drop of comfort in my sorrer I could git</l>

       <l n="31">My lot is humble , but I 've kept that lamp a-burnin ’ clear ,</l>

       <l n="1">It stands at the bend where the road has its end ,</l>

       <l n="30">On some blood-spattered battle-field , slain by a rifle-ball ;</l>

       <l n="1">The tired breezes are tucked to rest</l>
       <l n="2">In the cloud-beds far away ;</l>
       <l n="3">The waves are pressed to the placid breast</l>
       <l n="4">Of the dreaming , gleaming bay ;</l>
       <l n="5">The shore line swims in a hazy heat ,</l>
       <l n="6">Asleep in the sea and sky ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the muffled beat where the breakers meet</l>
       <l n="8">Is a soft , sweet lullaby .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">The pine-clad hill has a crimson crown</l>
       <l n="10">Of glittering sunset glows ;</l>
       <l n="11">The roofs of brown in the distant town</l>
       <l n="12">Are bathed in a blush of rose ;</l>
       <l n="13">The radiant ripples shine and shift</l>
       <l n="14">In shimmering shreds of gold ;</l>
       <l n="15">The seaweeds lift and drowse and drift ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the jellies fill and fold .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">The great sun sinks , and the gray fog heaps</l>
       <l n="18">His cloak on the silent sea ;</l>
       <l n="19">The night-wind creeps where the ocean sleeps ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the wavelets wake in glee ;</l>
       <l n="21">Across the bay , like a silver star ,</l>
       <l n="22">There twinkles the harbor-light ,</l>
       <l n="23">And faint and far from the outer bar</l>
       <l n="24">The sea-birds call “ Good-night . ”</l>
