    <head>DEAR JOHN DENTON ,</head>
    <head>Not long ago you reminded me that once , when you were a boy and I was a schoolmaster , I was angry with you because you pouted all through a lesson in arithmetic . Let bygones be bygones , and accept as a proof of my continuing friendship the dedication of this little volume , in which there are no other sums than those of the Telegraph .</head>

    <head>THE FEMALE BOY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">If cursed by a son who declined to play cricket ,</l>
     <l n="2">( Supposing him sound and sufficient in thews ,)</l>
     <l n="3">I 'd larrup him well with the third of a wicket ,</l>
     <l n="4">Selecting safe parts of his body to bruise .</l>
     <l n="5">In his mind such an urchin King Solomon had</l>
     <l n="6">When he said , Spare the stump , and you bungle the lad !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">For what in the world is the use of a creature</l>
     <l n="8">All flabbily bent on avoiding the Pitch ?</l>
     <l n="9">Who wanders about , with a sob in each feature ,</l>
     <l n="10">Devising a headache , inventing a stitch ?</l>
     <l n="11">There surely would be a quick end to my joy</l>
     <l n="12">If possessed of that monster — the feminine boy !—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">The feminine boy who declines upon croquet ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or halma , or spillikins ( horrible sport ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or any amusement that 's female and pokey ,</l>
     <l n="16">And flatly objects to behave as he ought !</l>
     <l n="17">I know him of old . He is lazy and fat ,</l>
     <l n="18">Instead of this Thing , fit for punishment drastic ,</l>
     <l n="19">Give , Fortune , a son who is nimble and keen ;</l>
     <l n="20">A bright-hearted sample of human elastic ,</l>
     <l n="21">As fast as an antelope , supple and clean ;</l>
     <l n="22">Far other than he in whose dimples there lodge</l>
     <l n="23">Significant signs of inordinate stodge .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="24">Ay , give me the lad who is eager and chubby ,</l>
     <l n="25">A Stoddart in little , a hero in bud ;</l>
     <l n="26">Who 'd think it a positive crime to grow tubby ,</l>
     <l n="27">And dreams half the night he 's a Steel or a Studd !</l>
     <l n="28">There 's the youth for my fancy , all youngsters above —</l>
     <l n="29">The boy for my handshake , the lad for my love !</l>

    <head>THE DARK BOWLER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I know that Bowler , dark and lean ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who holds his tongue , and pegs away ,</l>
     <l n="3">And never fails to come up keen ,</l>
     <l n="4">However hard and straight I play .</l>
     <l n="5">Spinning and living , from his hand</l>
     <l n="6">The leather , full of venom , leaps ;</l>
     <l n="7">How nicely are his changes planned ,</l>
     <l n="8">And what a lovely length he keeps !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Because he pulls his brim so low ,</l>
     <l n="10">However earnestly one tries</l>
     <l n="11">One never sees the darkling glow ,</l>
     <l n="12">That must be nimble in his eyes .</l>
     <l n="13">The fellow 's judgment never nods ,</l>
     <l n="14">His watchful spirit never sleeps .</l>
     <l n="15">There was a clinking ball ! Ye gods ,</l>
     <l n="16">Why , what a splendid length he keeps !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">At times he bowls an awkward ball</l>
     <l n="18">That in the queerest manner swerves ,</l>
     <l n="19">And this delivery of them all</l>
     <l n="20">Takes most elastic from my nerves :</l>
     <l n="21">It comes , and all along my spine</l>
     <l n="22">A sense of desolation creeps ;</l>
     <l n="23">Till now the mastery is mine ,</l>
     <l n="24">But — what a killing length he keeps !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">That nearly passed me ! That again</l>
     <l n="26">Miraculously missed the bails !</l>
     <l n="27">Too good a sportsman to complain ,</l>
     <l n="28">He never flags , he never stales .</l>
     <l n="29">Small wonder if his varied skill</l>
     <l n="30">So fine a harvest daily reaps ,</l>
     <l n="31">For how he marries wit and will !</l>
     <l n="32">And what a deadly length he keeps !</l>

   <p>In issuing a list of new and forthcoming publications , Mr. Alston Rivers cannot but express his gratification at the spirit of fair play which has enabled him to realise such a striking series of successes . The primary business of a publisher is to discriminate , both as to intrinsic literary merit , and with regard to what will hit the public taste , a classical illustration of the difficulty in gauging the latter being the rejection of “ John Inglesant ” by the late James Payn , then “ reader ” for an eminent firm . While fully recognising the remarkable gifts of the author Mr. Payn 's hesitancy as to the book 's attractions got the better of his judgment ; and with “ The House of Merrilees ” it is now an open secret that very much the same point of view was taken in more than one instance . Mr. Marshall 's “ Peter Binney , Undergraduate , ” had been and is still decidedly popular , but his new book was more ambitious , possessing such a plot as to require peculiarly delicate handling . Had it been handled in a way that combined a really high literary standard with more stirring qualities ? The question requires no answer now , for the triumph which the publisher at once foretold on reading the manuscript has been more than attained , and “ The House of Merrilees ” is indisputably the novel of the season . It has at the same time demonstrated to the publishing trade that a sensational story does not labour under any disadvantage by the abduction of literary style .</p>
   <p>In a wholly different vein are “ The Discipline of Christine ” and “ The Unequal Yoke , ” by Mrs. Barré Goldie and Mrs. H. H . Penrose respectively . In the former the ways and moods of childhood are depicted in original and inimitable fashion , which makes it safe to predict that the author will go far beyond her first effort as a novelist . In “ The Unequal Yoke ” Mrs. Penrose has taken for her theme the love story of a clergyman whose benefice is an Irish coast town , and in whose flock prominence is attained by narrow zeal rather than by amiability . He is really a good man , and is lucky enough , or the reverse , to win the hand of a delightful young lady whose charms , however , do not command the unanimous approval of the parishioners . The possession of high musical attainments makes her temperament all the more interesting , and accounts for the presence in so remote a district of her German friend whose acute sense of the ridiculous leads to such untoward results . It is hard to say whether the author 's talents are best evinced by her true pathos or by the delicate touches of humour which pervade the book . Another commendable feature of the novel is an alert skill in construction which stamps it as a thoroughly artistic production .</p>

   <p>Mr. Reginald Turner has already achieved such distinction as an author of superior fiction ( witness the success of his “ Comedy of Progress ” and “ Cynthia 's Damages , ” ) that a cordial reception was assured for his latest book “ Peace on Earth . ” It is a pathetic story that he has to tell ; of the sorrows of the outcast amid poverty , and the rage against law and government provoked thereby ; of the less obvious , but equally poignant , griefs which smoulder beneath the surface of “ comfortable circumstances . ” The plot is , in short , one that in the hands of any other than a thorough man of the world , would fail hopelessly , which makes Mr. Turner 's complete and undoubted success all the more meritorious .</p>
   <p>“ The Countermine ” is the work of Mr. Arthur Wenlock , whose “ As Down of Thistle ” showed considerable promise , though perhaps his subtle vein of sardonic philosophy escaped due recognition . As its name denotes , the interest in the new novel is largely military ; in every line the soldier , with his nice sense of honour , his virility , and his direct methods , stands revealed . “ The Countermine ” is certainly a most thrilling tale , and should raise the author to the front rank of writers on “ Service ” topics . Of Mr. Thomas Cobb , whose reputation is already firmly established , it is only necessary to say that in “ The Friendships of Veronica ” his fertile and resourceful pen is at its best if , indeed , his literary reputation has not been substantially advanced .</p>

   <p>The hustling methods of modernity possess undoubted possibilities for humorous treatment , and no one has appreciated the fact more keenly than the authors of “ Wisdom While you Wait . ” In this their latest work the prospectus of the Napolio Syndicate forms a bowstring whence fly shafts of satire that hit the mark every time .</p>

   <p>A striking study of nomadic life among the peasant classes , translated from the Russian by J. K. M . SHIRAZI .</p>
   <p>It is one thing to be a famous writer ; it is another to be widely read . Maxim Gorky is at present included in both categories , though as regards the second condition he had scarcely qualified prior to the publication of “ Creatures that once were Men . ” It was a bold venture , for all the former successes in shilling form were either sensationally melodramatic or frankly farcical . Encouraged by the huge demand for Maxim Gorky 's book , Mr. Alston Rivers is publishing in the same form ( 1 / -  nett , paper , and 1 / 6 cloth ) “ Publican and Serf , ” by Skitaletz , a Russian Author , who , while by no means behind Gorky in point of realism , possesses in the opinion of some critics a still greater measure of literary ability . Other items of Mr. Alston Rivers ’ Shilling Library , which has prospered as only the result of the most careful selection could prosper , are “ Lovers in London , ” by A. A. Milne , brightest and most promising of the younger humorists , and “ The Loot of Cities , ” by Mr. Arnold Bennett , the mere name of whom is a sufficient guarantee of entertainment . As for general literature , “ The Soul of London , ” by Ford Madox Hueffer , may be justly described as worthy of a place in every library . The author in his introduction , remarks that he has tried to make the book anything rather than encyclopædic , topographical , or archæological , and beyond that somewhat negative phrase it is difficult to give any more complete designation to the work . For the treatment of the subject is altogether original , this attraction being intensified by the particularly graceful style in which a remarkable gift of observation finds expression .</p>
