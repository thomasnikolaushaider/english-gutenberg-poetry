     <l n="1">Turn from Kerry crossroads and leave the wooded dells ,</l>
     <l n="2">Take the mountain path and find where Tip O'Leary dwells ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Tip O'Leary keeps the lights of many lamps aglow ,</l>
     <l n="6">Little matters it to him the seasons come or go ,</l>
     <l n="7">Sure if spring is in the air his hedges are abloom ,</l>
     <l n="8">And fairy buds like candles shine across his garden room .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Roses in the June days are light the miles around ,</l>
     <l n="10">Tapers of the fuchsias move along the August ground ,</l>
     <l n="11">Sumachs light the flaming torches by October 's grave</l>
     <l n="12">And like the campfires on the hills the oaks and maples wave .</l>

     <l n="13">All the lights but only one die out when summer goes ,</l>
     <l n="14">One that Tip O'Leary keeps is brighter than the rose ,</l>
     <l n="15">Through the window comes the bloom on any winter night ,</l>
     <l n="16">And every sense goes wild to it , soft and sweet and bright .</l>

     <l n="17">Lamps are fair that have the light from flowers all day long ,</l>
     <l n="18">When the birds are here and sing the Tip O'Leary song ,</l>
     <l n="19">But a winter window is the fairest rose of all ,</l>
     <l n="20">When Tip O'Leary ' s hearth is lit and lamps upon the wall .</l>
