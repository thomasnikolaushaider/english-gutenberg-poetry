    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">St. Andrews , but for its Town Council and its School Board , is a quiet place ; and the University , except during the progress of a Rectorial Election , is peaceable and well-conducted . I hope these verses may so far reflect St. Andrews life as to be found pleasant , if not over exciting .</p>
    <p n="2">I am able to reprint the verses on ‘ The City of Golf ’ by the special courtesy of the Editor of the Saturday Review .</p>
    <p n="3">A few explanatory notes are given at the end of the book .</p>

     <l n="1">The voice that sings across the night</l>

     <l n="3">Is there an ear to hear aright</l>
     <l n="4">The voice that sings ?</l>

     <l n="5">It is as when a curfew rings</l>

     <l n="8">And faded eyes that once were bright</l>
     <l n="9">Brim over , as to life it brings</l>
     <l n="10">The echo of a dead delight ,</l>

     <l n="1">In vain you fervently extol ,</l>
     <l n="2">In vain you puff , your cutty clay .</l>
     <l n="3">A twelvemonth smoked and black as coal ,</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Tis redolent of rank decay</l>
     <l n="5">And bones of monks long passed away —</l>
     <l n="6">A fragrance I do not admire ;</l>
     <l n="7">And so I hold my nose and say ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Macleod , whose judgment on the whole</l>

     <l n="11">To nurse a high-born meerschaum bowl ,</l>
     <l n="12">For which he sweetly had to pay .</l>
     <l n="13">Ah , let him nurse it as he may ,</l>
     <l n="14">Before the colour mounts much higher ,</l>
     <l n="15">The grate shall be its fate one day .</l>
     <l n="16">Give me a finely seasoned briar .</l>

     <l n="17">The heathen Turk of Istamboul ,</l>

     <l n="20">With hookahs , bubbling in a way</l>
     <l n="21">To fill a Christian with dismay</l>
     <l n="22">And wake the old Crusading fire .</l>
     <l n="23">May no such pipe be mine , I pray ;</l>

     <l n="4">Hail ! Hail to thee !</l>
     <l n="5">To thee I bring this woven weed</l>
     <l n="6">Culled for thee from a virgin mead ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where neither shepherd claims his flocks to feed</l>
     <l n="8">Nor ever yet the mower 's scythe hath come .</l>
     <l n="9">There in the Spring the wild bee hath his home ,</l>
     <l n="10">Lightly passing to and fro</l>
     <l n="11">Where the virgin flowers grow ;</l>
     <l n="12">And there the watchful Purity doth go</l>
     <l n="13">Moistening with dew-drops all the ground below ,</l>
     <l n="14">Drawn from a river untaintedly flowing ,</l>
     <l n="15">They who have gained by a kind fate 's bestowing</l>
     <l n="16">Pure hearts , untaught by philosophy 's care ,</l>
     <l n="17">May gather the flowers in the mead that are blowing ,</l>
     <l n="18">But the tainted in spirit may never be there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">Now , O Divinest , eternally fair ,</l>
     <l n="20">Take thou this garland to gather thy hair ,</l>
     <l n="21">Brought by a hand that is pure as the air .</l>
     <l n="22">For I alone of all the sons of men</l>
     <l n="23">Hear thy pure accents , answering thee again .</l>
     <l n="24">And may I reach the goal of life as I began the race ,</l>
     <l n="25">Blest by the music of thy voice , though darkness ever veil thy face !</l>

    <head>ON A CRUSHED HAT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Brown was my friend , and faithful — but so fat !</l>
     <l n="2">He came to see me in the twilight dim ;</l>
     <l n="3">I rose politely and invited him</l>
     <l n="4">To take a seat — how heavily he sat !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">He sat upon the sofa , where my hat ,</l>
     <l n="6">My wanton Zephyr , rested on its rim ;</l>
     <l n="7">Its build , unlike my friend 's , was rather slim ,</l>
     <l n="8">And when he rose , I saw it , crushed and flat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">O Hat , that wast the apple of my eye ,</l>
     <l n="10">Thy brim is bent , six cracks are in thy crown ,</l>
     <l n="11">And I shall never wear thee any more ;</l>
     <l n="12">Upon a shelf thy loved remains shall lie ,</l>
     <l n="13">And with the years the dust will settle down</l>
     <l n="14">On thee , the neatest hat I ever wore !</l>

     <l n="30">With hemlock or with halter ,</l>

     <l n="36">And visits to his friends ,</l>
     <l n="37">And youth with pleasure yoking ,</l>
     <l n="38">And joyfulness and joking ,</l>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">For the information of those who have not the happiness to be members of the University of St. Andrews , it may be well to explain a few terms . A bejant is an undergraduate student of the first year . In his second year he becomes a semi , in his third a tertian , and in his fourth a magistrand . The last would seem to be a gerundive form , implying that a man at the end of his fourth year ought to be made a Master of Arts ; but unfortunately this does not always happen . A divine is a student in Divinity . A waster is a man of idle and ( it may be ) profligate habits . A grinder , on the contrary , is one who ‘ grinds ’ or reads with an unusual degree of application . A bunk is the lodging or abode in St. Andrews of any student . A spree is not necessarily an entertainment of rowdy character ; the most decorous Professorial dinner - party would be called a spree . A solatium is a Debating Society spree , held in December or January ; a gaudeamus is a festival of the same kind , only rather more ambitious , celebrated towards the close of the session . Session would be rendered in England by ‘ term . ’ The Competition ( for Bursaries ) , or the ‘ Comp ., ’ is the examination for entrance scholarships . The cage is a curious structure of glass , iron , and wood , in which notices and examination lists are posted . The letters S. R. C. denote the Students ’ Representative Council . An L. L. A . is a Lady Literate in Arts . Math . ( as the discerning reader will not be slow to perceive ) is an abbreviation , endearing or otherwise , of the word Mathematics . Moral stands for Moral Philosophy . Prof. is a shortened form of Professor , and certif . of certificate . Plough , pluck , and spin are used indifferently , to signify the action of an examiner in rejecting a candidate for the M. A . or any other degree . It should be mentioned that the degree of B. A . is not now conferred by the Universities of Scotland .</p>
