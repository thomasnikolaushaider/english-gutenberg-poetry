     <l n="8">To bit and bridle rein ,</l>
     <l n="9">To ditches deep and fences high ,</l>
     <l n="10">For I have dreamed a dream , and I</l>
     <l n="11">Shall never ride again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">‘ I dreamt last night I rode this race</l>
     <l n="13">That I to-day must ride ,</l>
     <l n="14">And cant'ring down to take my place</l>
     <l n="15">I saw full many an old friend 's face</l>
     <l n="16">Come stealing to my side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">‘ Dead men on horses long since dead ,</l>
     <l n="18">They clustered on the track ;</l>
     <l n="19">The champions of the days long fled ,</l>
     <l n="20">They moved around with noiseless tread —</l>
     <l n="21">Bay , chestnut , brown , and black .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="22">‘ And one man on a big grey steed</l>
     <l n="23">Rode up and waved his hand ;</l>
     <l n="24">Said he , “ We help a friend in need ,</l>
     <l n="25">And we have come to give a lead</l>
     <l n="26">To you and Rio Grande .</l>

     <l n="28">So never draw the rein ,</l>

     <l n="37">‘ We started , and in front we showed ,</l>
     <l n="38">The big horse running free :</l>
     <l n="39">Right fearlessly and game he strode ,</l>
     <l n="40">And by my side those dead men rode</l>
     <l n="41">Whom no one else could see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="42">‘ As silently as flies a bird ,</l>
     <l n="43">They rode on either hand ;</l>
     <l n="44">At every fence I plainly heard</l>
     <l n="45">The phantom leader give the word ,</l>
     <l n="46">“ Make room for Rio Grande ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="47">‘ I spurred him on to get the lead ,</l>
     <l n="48">I chanced full many a fall ;</l>
     <l n="49">But swifter still each phantom steed</l>
     <l n="50">Kept with me , and at racing speed</l>
     <l n="51">We reached the big stone wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="52">‘ And there the phantoms on each side</l>
     <l n="53">Drew in and blocked his leap ;</l>
     <l n="54">“ Make room ! make room ! ” I loudly cried ,</l>
     <l n="55">But right in front they seemed to ride —</l>
     <l n="56">I cursed them in my sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="57">‘ He never flinched , he faced it game ,</l>
     <l n="58">He struck it with his chest ,</l>
     <l n="59">And every stone burst out in flame ,</l>
     <l n="60">And Rio Grande and I became</l>
     <l n="61">As phantoms with the rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="62">‘ And then I woke , and for a space</l>
     <l n="63">All nerveless did I seem ;</l>
     <l n="64">For I have ridden many a race ,</l>
     <l n="65">But never one at such a pace</l>
     <l n="66">As in that fearful dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="67">‘ And I am sure as man can be</l>
     <l n="68">That out upon the track ,</l>
     <l n="69">Those phantoms that men cannot see</l>
     <l n="70">Are waiting now to ride with me ,</l>
     <l n="71">And I shall not come back .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="72">‘ For I must ride the dead men 's race ,</l>
     <l n="73">And follow their command ;</l>
     <l n="74">‘ Twere worse than death , the foul disgrace</l>
     <l n="75">If I should fear to take my place</l>
     <l n="76">To-day on Rio Grande . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="77">He mounted , and a jest he threw ,</l>
     <l n="78">With never sign of gloom ;</l>
     <l n="79">But all who heard the story knew</l>
     <l n="80">That Jack Macpherson , brave and true ,</l>
     <l n="81">Was going to his doom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="82">They started , and the big black steed</l>
     <l n="83">Came flashing past the stand ;</l>
     <l n="84">All single-handed in the lead</l>
     <l n="85">He strode along at racing speed ,</l>
     <l n="86">The mighty Rio Grande .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="87">But on his ribs the whalebone stung ,</l>
     <l n="88">A madness it did seem !</l>
     <l n="89">And soon it rose on every tongue</l>
     <l n="90">That Jack Macpherson rode among</l>
     <l n="91">The creatures of his dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="92">He looked to left and looked to right ,</l>
     <l n="93">As though men rode beside ;</l>
     <l n="94">And Rio Grande , with foam-flecks white ,</l>
     <l n="95">Raced at his jumps in headlong flight</l>
     <l n="96">And cleared them in his stride .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="97">But when they reached the big stone wall ,</l>
     <l n="98">Down went the bridle-hand ,</l>
     <l n="99">And loud we heard Macpherson call ,</l>
     <l n="100">‘ Make room , or half the field will fall !</l>
     <l n="101">Make room for Rio Grande ! ’</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="105">No need the pallid face to scan ,</l>
     <l n="106">We knew with Rio Grande he ran</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="109">Far to the Northward there lies a land ,</l>
     <l n="110">A wonderful land that the winds blow over ,</l>
     <l n="111">And none may fathom nor understand</l>
     <l n="112">The charm it holds for the restless rover ;</l>
     <l n="113">A great grey chaos — a land half made ,</l>
     <l n="114">Where endless space is and no life stirreth ;</l>
     <l n="115">And the soul of a man will recoil afraid</l>
     <l n="116">From the sphinx-like visage that Nature weareth .</l>
     <l n="117">But old Dame Nature , though scornful , craves</l>
     <l n="118">Her dole of death and her share of slaughter ;</l>
     <l n="119">Many indeed are the nameless graves</l>

     <l n="121">Slowly and slowly those grey streams glide ,</l>

     <l n="1222">The news came down on the Castlereagh , and went to the world at large ,</l>
     <l n="1223">That twenty thousand travelling sheep , with Saltbush Bill in charge ,</l>
     <l n="1224">Were drifting down from a dried-out run to ravage the Castlereagh ;</l>
     <l n="1225">And the squatters swore when they heard the news ,</l>
     <l n="1226">and wished they were well away :</l>
     <l n="1227">For the name and the fame of Saltbush Bill were over the country side</l>
     <l n="1228">For the wonderful way that he fed his sheep ,</l>
     <l n="1229">and the dodges and tricks he tried .</l>
     <l n="1230">He would lose his way on a Main Stock Route ,</l>

     <l n="1234">If he had to fight , he would fight all day , so long as his sheep got through :</l>
     <l n="1235">But this is the story of Stingy Smith , the owner of Hard Times Hill ,</l>
     <l n="1236">And the way that he chanced on a fighting man to reckon with Saltbush Bill .</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="223">
     <l n="1238">‘ Twas Stingy Smith on his stockyard sat , and prayed for an early Spring ,</l>
     <l n="1239">When he stared at sight of a clean-shaved tramp , who walked with jaunty swing ;</l>
     <l n="1240">For a clean-shaved tramp with a jaunty walk a-swinging along the track</l>
     <l n="1241">Is as rare a thing as a feathered frog on the desolate roads out back .</l>
     <l n="1242">So the tramp he made for the travellers ’ hut ,</l>
     <l n="1243">and asked could he camp the night ;</l>
     <l n="1244">But Stingy Smith had a bright idea , and he said to him , ‘ Can you fight ? ’</l>
     <l n="1245">‘ Why , what 's the game ? ’ said the clean-shaved tramp ,</l>
     <l n="1246">as he looked at him up and down —</l>
     <l n="1247">‘ If you want a battle , get off that fence , and I 'll kill you for half-a-crown !</l>
     <l n="1248">But , Boss , you 'd better not fight with me , it would n't be fair nor right ;</l>
     <l n="1249">I 'm Stiffener Joe , from the Rocks Brigade , and I killed a man in a fight :</l>
     <l n="1250">I served two years for it , fair and square , and now I 'm a trampin ’ back ,</l>
     <l n="1251">To look for a peaceful quiet life away on the outside track —— ’</l>
     <l n="1252">‘ Oh , it 's not myself , but a drover chap , ’ said Stingy Smith with glee ;</l>
     <l n="1253">‘ A bullying fellow , called Saltbush Bill — and you are the man for me .</l>
     <l n="1254">He 's on the road with his hungry sheep , and he 's certain to raise a row ,</l>
     <l n="1255">For he 's bullied the whole of the Castlereagh till he 's got them under cow —</l>
     <l n="1256">Just pick a quarrel and raise a fight , and leather him good and hard ,</l>
     <l n="1257">And I 'll take good care that his wretched sheep do n't wander a half a yard .</l>
     <l n="1258">It 's a five-pound job if you belt him well — do anything short of kill ,</l>
     <l n="1259">For there is n't a beak on the Castlereagh will fine you for Saltbush Bill . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="224">
     <l n="1260">‘ I 'll take the job , ’ said the fighting man ; ‘ and hot as this cove appears ,</l>

     <l n="1262">what 's lived on the game for years ;</l>
     <l n="1263">For he 's maybe learnt in a boxing school , and sparred for a round or so ,</l>
     <l n="1264">But I 've fought all hands in a ten-foot ring each night in a travelling show ;</l>
     <l n="1265">They earned a pound if they stayed three rounds ,</l>
     <l n="1266">and they tried for it every night —</l>
     <l n="1267">In a ten-foot ring ! Oh , that 's the game that teaches a bloke to fight ,</l>
     <l n="1268">For they 'd rush and clinch , it was Dublin Rules , and we drew no colour line ;</l>
     <l n="1269">And they all tried hard for to earn the pound , but they got no pound of mine :</l>
     <l n="1270">If I saw no chance in the opening round I 'd slog at their wind , and wait</l>
     <l n="1271">Till an opening came — and it ALWAYS came — and I settled ‘ em , sure as fate ;</l>
     <l n="1272">Left on the ribs and right on the jaw —</l>
     <l n="1273">and , when the chance comes , MAKE SURE !</l>
     <l n="1274">And it 's there a professional bloke like me gets home on an amateur :</l>

     <l n="1281">I 'll tell the cook you 're to have your grub , and see that you eat your fill ,</l>

     <l n="1284">‘ Twas Saltbush Bill , and his travelling sheep were wending their weary way</l>
     <l n="1285">On the Main Stock Route , through the Hard Times Run ,</l>
     <l n="1286">on their six-mile stage a day ;</l>
     <l n="1287">And he strayed a mile from the Main Stock Route , and started to feed along ,</l>
     <l n="1288">And , when Stingy Smith came up , Bill said that the Route was surveyed wrong ;</l>
     <l n="1289">And he tried to prove that the sheep had rushed</l>
     <l n="1290">and strayed from their camp at night ,</l>
     <l n="1291">But the fighting man he kicked Bill 's dog , and of course that meant a fight :</l>
     <l n="1292">So they sparred and fought , and they shifted ground</l>
     <l n="1293">and never a sound was heard</l>
     <l n="1294">But the thudding fists on their brawny ribs , and the seconds ’ muttered word ,</l>
     <l n="1295">Till the fighting man shot home his left on the ribs with a mighty clout ,</l>
     <l n="1296">And his right flashed up with a half-arm blow — and Saltbush Bill ‘ went out ’ .</l>
     <l n="1297">He fell face down , and towards the blow ;</l>
     <l n="1298">and their hearts with fear were filled ,</l>
     <l n="1299">For he lay as still as a fallen tree , and they thought that he must be killed .</l>
     <l n="1300">So Stingy Smith and the fighting man , they lifted him from the ground ,</l>
     <l n="1301">And sent to home for a brandy-flask , and they slowly fetched him round ;</l>
     <l n="1302">But his head was bad , and his jaw was hurt —</l>
     <l n="1303">in fact , he could scarcely speak —</l>
     <l n="1304">So they let him spell till he got his wits , and he camped on the run a week ,</l>
     <l n="1305">While the travelling sheep went here and there , wherever they liked to stray ,</l>

     <l n="2">Eloquent and ardent verses . ”</l>

   <p>* “ At his best he compares not unfavourably with the author of ‘ Barrack-Room Ballads ’ . ”</p>
   <p>* Mr. A. Patchett Martin ( London ): “ In my opinion , it is the absolutely un-English , thoroughly Australian style and character of these new bush bards which has given them such immediate popularity , such wide vogue , among all classes of the rising native generation . ”</p>

   <p>* “ There is no mistaking the vigour of Mr. Paterson 's verse ; there is no difficulty in feeling the strong human interest which moves in it . ”</p>
   <p>* “ Every way worthy of the man who ranks with the first of Australian poets . ”</p>

   <p>* “ Now and again a deeper theme , like an echo from the older , more experienced land , leads him to more serious singing , and proves that real poetry is , after all , universal . It is a hearty book . ”</p>
   <p>* “ Mr. Paterson has powerful and varied sympathies , coupled with a genuine lyrical impulse , and some skill , which makes his attempts always attractive and usually successful . ”</p>
   <p>* “ These are all entertaining , their rough and ready wit and virility of expression making them highly acceptable , while the dash of satire gives point to the humour . ”</p>
   <p>* “ He catches the bush in its most joyous moments , and writes of it with the simple charm of an unaffected lover . ”</p>
   <p>* “ Will be welcome to that too select class at home who follow the Australian endeavour to utter a fresh and genuine poetic voice . ”</p>
   <p>* “ Mr. Paterson now proves beyond question that Australia has produced at least one singer who can voice in truest poetry the aspirations and experiences peculiar to the Commonwealth , and who is to be ranked with the foremost living poets of the motherland . ”</p>
   <p>* “ Fine , swinging , stirring stuff , that sings as it goes along . The subjects are capital , and some of the refrains haunt one . There is always room for a book of unpretentious , vigorous verse of this sort . ”</p>
   <p>* “ These ballads make bright and easy reading ; one takes up the book , and , delighted at the rhythm , turns page after page , finding entertainment upon each . ”</p>
   <p>Biographical Note :</p>
   <p>Andrew Barton Paterson was born at Narambla , in New South Wales , on 17 February 1864 , but grew up at Buckenbah and Illalong . He became a lawyer but devoted much of his time to writing , and gained popularity especially for his poetry and ballads . His best known poems are The Man from Snowy River ( 1892 ) on which a motion picture was loosely based , and Waltzing Matilda ( 1895 ) which slowly became an Australian symbol and national song . The poems he wrote for a Sydney newspaper led him into reporting , and he went to South Africa to cover the Boer War . Always a fair man , he had his doubts about the war and was a little too vocal about it for the tastes of some of his readers . During the First World War he served in Egypt as a Major in a Remount Unit , training horses for the war . This fit one of his main interests in life — horses — a preoccupation which is very evident in his poems , and even in his choice of pseudonym — “ The Banjo ” was a race-horse .</p>
   <p>The works for which Paterson is famous were mostly written before the First World War , and are collected in three books of poems , The Man from Snowy River and Other Verses ( 1895 ) , Rio Grande 's Last Race and Other Verses ( 1902 ) , and Saltbush Bill , J. P. and Other Verses ( 1917 ) . His prose works include An Outback Marriage ( 1906 ) , and Three Elephant Power and Other Stories ( 1917 ) , the latter of which is a collection of tall tales and serious ( but often humourous ) reporting . In fact , above all else it is perhaps Paterson 's sense of humour that sets him apart from such balladists as Rudyard Kipling and Robert Service . It should also be noted that Paterson was writing his ballads before either of these became well-known , and there was little , if any , influence from either side . More likely , Paterson was influenced by the Scottish tradition of poetry ( Paterson was of Scottish descent ) which had been popularized in Australia by Adam Lindsay Gordon and others . Banjo Paterson died of a heart attack on 5 February , 1941 .</p>
