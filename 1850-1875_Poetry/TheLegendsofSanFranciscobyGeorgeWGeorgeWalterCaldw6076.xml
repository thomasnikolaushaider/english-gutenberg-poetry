    <docImprint>My<settlement>San Francisco</settlement>on her seven hills is smiling , Beside an opalescent sunset sea ; There is a magic in her bracing air beguiling , Yet filling all with tireless energy . The tingling tang of open sea the breeze is giving ; The fog rolls in and drives heat languors out , And thrills her loyal subjects with the joy of living , And puts the love of idleness to rout . When in the valleys , fervent summer heat oppresses , And gives no , respite night or day , There is a City that the cooling fog caresses , Upon the breezy<settlement>San Francisco</settlement>Bay . When winter rains and sun have wrought in fragrant flowers A multicolored carpet on the land , A charm is in her circling hills and redwood bowers That only those who see can understand . She has a mystic charm in all the changing seasons — A lure that brings the stranger to her door , And in these pages I will give the Indian 's reasons For charms and lures , never told before . The legends of the hills , the fog , the gulls , the waters Idealize the beautiful and true ; Allow me , therefore , California 's Native Daughters , To dedicate this book of verse to you .</docImprint>

   <p>The Maid of Tamalpais .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This she told me in the firelight</l>
     <l n="2">As I sat beside her campfire ,</l>
     <l n="3">In a grove of giant redwoods ,</l>
     <l n="4">On the slope of Tamalpais .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Old she was , and bent and wrinkled ,</l>
     <l n="6">Lone survivor of the Tamals ,</l>
     <l n="7">Ancient tribe of Indian people ,</l>
     <l n="8">Who have left their name and legend</l>
     <l n="9">On the mountain they held sacred .</l>
     <l n="10">On the ground she sat and brooded ,</l>
     <l n="11">With a blanket wrapped around her —</l>
     <l n="12">Sat and gazed into the campfire .</l>
     <l n="13">On her bronze and furrowed features ,</l>
     <l n="14">On her hair of snowy whiteness ,</l>
     <l n="15">Played the shadows and the firelight .</l>
     <l n="16">Long she gazed into the embers ,</l>
     <l n="17">And I feared I had offended</l>
     <l n="18">In the question I had asked her .</l>
     <l n="19">Then she spoke in measured accents ,</l>
     <l n="20">Slowly , with a mournful cadence ,</l>
     <l n="21">And long intervals of silence .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="22">“ You have asked me why my people</l>
     <l n="23">Will not climb Mount Tamalpais —</l>
     <l n="24">Why we hold the mountain sacred .</l>
     <l n="25">I am old , and when the Raven</l>
     <l n="26">Calls my spirit to the Father ,</l>
     <l n="27">None will know the ancient story ,</l>
     <l n="28">Sacred legend of the Tamals .</l>
     <l n="29">Therefore , I will tell the story ,</l>
     <l n="30">I will tell and you shall write it ,</l>
     <l n="31">Else it will be lost forever ;</l>
     <l n="32">I will tell it that the paleface</l>
     <l n="33">May respect our sacred mountain . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">“ In the morning of creation</l>
     <l n="35">All the world was covered over</l>
     <l n="36">With the flood of troubled waters .</l>
     <l n="37">Only Beaver and the Turtle</l>
     <l n="38">Swam about upon the surface .</l>
     <l n="39">Beaver said , ‘ I 'm very weary . ’</l>
     <l n="40">Turtle said , ‘ Dive to the bottom . ’</l>
     <l n="41">Beaver dove and brought up gravel ,</l>
     <l n="42">Laid it on the back of Turtle ;</l>
     <l n="43">Dove again and brought a pebble ,</l>
     <l n="44">Then another and another .</l>
     <l n="45">Pebbles grew to rocks and boulders ,</l>
     <l n="46">As a peak above the waters —</l>
     <l n="47">Thus was Mount Diablo fashioned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="48">Beaver sat upon the mountain ,</l>
     <l n="49">Gazing out across the waters ;</l>
     <l n="50">Saw a single feather floating ;</l>
     <l n="51">Feather grew into an Eagle ;</l>
     <l n="52">Eagle flew and sat by Beaver .</l>
     <l n="53">Long they talked about creation ,</l>
     <l n="54">Counseled , planned , and reconsidered ,</l>
     <l n="55">Then they moulded clay with tules ;</l>
     <l n="56">Beaver placed his hair upon it ,</l>
     <l n="57">Eagle breathed into its nostrils</l>
     <l n="58">Thus Coyote was created .</l>
     <l n="59">Coyote barked and sat beside them .</l>
     <l n="60">Many creatures were created ;</l>
     <l n="61">Some with hair , and some with feathers ;</l>
     <l n="62">Some with scales , or shells , or bristles .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">Other peaks and mountain ridges</l>
     <l n="64">Then appeared above the waters .</l>
     <l n="65">Walls of hills were then continued</l>
     <l n="66">North and south , to hold the waters</l>
     <l n="67">In a mammoth lake , that , filling</l>
     <l n="68">All the Sacramento Valley ,</l>
     <l n="69">Found its outlet to the ocean</l>
     <l n="70">Through the Russian River Canyon .</l>
     <l n="71">Round the lake the blazing mountains</l>
     <l n="72">Spouted lava and hot ashes ;</l>
     <l n="73">Casting on the troubled waters</l>
     <l n="74">Lurid gleams and purple shadows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="75">By the lake Coyote wandered —</l>
     <l n="76">Sat and howled , for he was lonely ,</l>
     <l n="77">Lonely for a Man to tame him</l>
     <l n="78">Into Dog as a companion .</l>
     <l n="79">Then Coyote mixed dry tules</l>
     <l n="80">With wet clay and made a figure .</l>
     <l n="81">Sun God came and shone upon it ;</l>
     <l n="82">Spirit came and blew upon it ,</l>
     <l n="83">And a Man was thus created .</l>
     <l n="84">Sun God made the Moon to guard him ,</l>
     <l n="85">And she stood before his tepee ,</l>
     <l n="86">Watching while the Sun was sleeping ;</l>
     <l n="87">But she loved the Sun and followed</l>
     <l n="88">Him into the starry heavens ,</l>
     <l n="89">Always with her face turned to him .</l>
     <l n="90">Still she watched the lonely tepee ,</l>
     <l n="91">And her heart was touched with pity</l>
     <l n="92">For the lonely man within it ,</l>
     <l n="93">So she made a lovely woman ,</l>
     <l n="94">Gave her constancy , and sent her</l>
     <l n="95">On a moonbeam to his tepee ,</l>
     <l n="96">As his helpmate and companion .</l>
     <l n="97">Man then multiplied , and flourished ,</l>
     <l n="98">Building villages and lording</l>
     <l n="99">Over all the other creatures .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="100">On the sunny eastern margin</l>
     <l n="101">Of the Bay of San Francisco ,</l>
     <l n="102">Grew the village of the Tamals ;</l>
     <l n="103">Fisher folk they were , and gentle ,</l>
     <l n="104">Seeking not for wars of conquest ;</l>
     <l n="105">Fishing in the purple waters</l>
     <l n="106">From their boats of bark or rawhide ;</l>
     <l n="107">Wading in the limpid shallows</l>
     <l n="108">Seeking oysters , clams and mussels .</l>
     <l n="109">In the course of generations</l>
     <l n="110">Piles of shells of many banquets ,</l>
     <l n="111">With the ashes of their campfires ,</l>
     <l n="112">Formed a mound upon the bay shore .</l>
     <l n="113">Shell Mound Park , the people call it ,</l>
     <l n="114">And they gather in the shadows</l>
     <l n="115">Of the ancient oaks for pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="116">Roasting clams as in the old days</l>
     <l n="117">When the Tamals lived upon it .</l>
     <l n="118">Gone are now the limpid shallows ;</l>
     <l n="119">Gone the oysters and the mussels ,</l>
     <l n="120">And no more are grassy meadows</l>
     <l n="121">Dappled with the spreading oak trees ;</l>
     <l n="122">For great factories , grim and sordid ,</l>
     <l n="123">Sprawl in squalid blocks around it ,</l>
     <l n="124">And the smoke of forge and furnace</l>
     <l n="125">Rise from stacks into the heavens .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="126">Paleface men with concave glasses ,</l>
     <l n="127">Learned in lore of printed pages ,</l>
     <l n="128">Dig into the mounds and gather</l>
     <l n="129">Spear and arrow heads and axes ,</l>
     <l n="130">Broken weapons and utensils</l>
     <l n="131">Made of flint , or bone , or seashell .</l>

     <l n="135">And the crags upthrust their fingers</l>
     <l n="136">Through the meadows of the uplands ,</l>
     <l n="137">Was another Indian village ,</l>
     <l n="138">Ancient stronghold of the Tamals .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="139">In the village on the hillside</l>
     <l n="140">Men were hunters , brave and fearless ,</l>
     <l n="141">Skillful with the bow and arrow ,</l>
     <l n="142">Artful with the snare and deadfall ;</l>
     <l n="143">Hunting deer and elk and bison</l>
     <l n="144">In the open grassy meadows ,</l>
     <l n="145">Tracking wolf and mountain lion</l>
     <l n="146">To their lairs among the redwoods ;</l>
     <l n="147">Bearing on their backs the trophies</l>
     <l n="148">To their camp when night was falling .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="149">In the village maids and matrons</l>
     <l n="150">Dressed the furs and tanned the buckskin ,</l>
     <l n="151">Dried the venison , and traded</l>
     <l n="152">With the Shell Mound folks for salmon ,</l>
     <l n="153">Mussels , clams and abalones ,</l>
     <l n="154">Ornaments of bone or seashell ,</l>
     <l n="155">Weapons chipped from flint or jasper .</l>
     <l n="156">From the oaks they gathered acorns ,</l>

     <l n="158">And the heavy blooming buckeyes ,</l>
     <l n="159">Ground the acorns into flour</l>
     <l n="160">To be baked upon the hot-stones .</l>

     <l n="161">To this day the smoke of campfires</l>

     <l n="165">If you search among the thickets</l>
     <l n="166">Of the low widespreading buckeyes</l>
     <l n="167">You will find their ancient mortars</l>
     <l n="168">In the bedrock still remaining —</l>
     <l n="169">Mortar holes ground deep , and polished</l>
     <l n="170">By the toil of many women</l>
     <l n="171">Pounding , grinding with a pestle</l>

     <l n="177">Many tribes have fought and conquered ,</l>
     <l n="178">Lived for many generations ,</l>
     <l n="179">Then were driven out by others .</l>

     <l n="185">As the picture came before her</l>

     <l n="187">Then I rose and piled more branches</l>
