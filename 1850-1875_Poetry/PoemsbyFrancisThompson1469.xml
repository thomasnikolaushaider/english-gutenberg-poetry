I give your own giving .</item>

       <l n="2">As lovers , banished from their lady 's face</l>
       <l n="3">And hopeless of her grace ,</l>
       <l n="4">Fashion a ghostly sweetness in its place ,</l>
       <l n="5">Fondly adore</l>
       <l n="6">Some stealth-won cast attire she wore ,</l>
       <l n="7">A kerchief or a glove :</l>
       <l n="8">And at the lover 's beck</l>
       <l n="9">Into the glove there fleets the hand ,</l>
       <l n="10">Or at impetuous command</l>
       <l n="11">Up from the kerchief floats the virgin neck :</l>
       <l n="12">So I , in very lowlihead of love , -</l>
       <l n="13">Too shyly reverencing</l>
       <l n="14">To let one thought 's light footfall smooth</l>
       <l n="15">Tread near the living , consecrated thing , -</l>
       <l n="16">Treasure me thy cast youth .</l>
       <l n="17">This outworn vesture , tenantless of thee ,</l>
       <l n="18">Hath yet my knee ,</l>
       <l n="19">For that , with show and semblance fair</l>
       <l n="20">Of the past Her</l>
       <l n="21">Who once the beautiful , discarded raiment bare ,</l>
       <l n="22">It cheateth me .</l>
       <l n="23">As gale to gale drifts breath</l>
       <l n="24">Of blossoms ’ death ,</l>
       <l n="25">So dropping down the years from hour to hour</l>
       <l n="26">This dead youth 's scent is wafted me to-day :</l>
       <l n="27">I sit , and from the fragrance dream the flower .</l>
       <l n="28">So , then , she looked ( I say ) ;</l>
       <l n="29">And so her front sunk down</l>
       <l n="30">Heavy beneath the poet 's iron crown :</l>
       <l n="31">On her mouth museful sweet -</l>
       <l n="32">( Even as the twin lips meet )</l>
       <l n="33">Did thought and sadness greet :</l>
       <l n="34">Sighs</l>
       <l n="35">In those mournful eyes</l>
       <l n="36">So put on visibilities ;</l>
       <l n="37">As viewless ether turns , in deep on deep , to dyes .</l>
       <l n="38">Thus , long ago ,</l>
       <l n="39">She kept her meditative paces slow</l>
       <l n="40">Through maiden meads , with waved shadow and gleam</l>
       <l n="41">Of locks half-lifted on the winds of dream ,</l>
       <l n="42">Till love up-caught her to his chariot 's glow .</l>
       <l n="43">Yet , voluntary , happier Proserpine !</l>
       <l n="44">This drooping flower of youth thou lettest fall</l>
       <l n="45">I , faring in the cockshut-light , astray ,</l>
       <l n="46">Find on my ‘ lated way ,</l>
       <l n="47">And stoop , and gather for memorial ,</l>
       <l n="48">And lay it on my bosom , and make it mine .</l>
       <l n="49">To this , the all of love the stars allow me ,</l>
       <l n="50">I dedicate and vow me .</l>
       <l n="51">I reach back through the days</l>
       <l n="52">A trothed hand to the dead the last trump shall not raise .</l>
       <l n="53">The water-wraith that cries</l>
       <l n="54">From those eternal sorrows of thy pictured eyes</l>
       <l n="55">Entwines and draws me down their soundless intricacies !</l>

       <l n="45">When conscious hush expects the cloud</l>
       <l n="46">To speak the golden secret loud</l>

       <l n="91">Sweet Summer ! unto you this swallow drew ,</l>
       <l n="92">By secret instincts inappeasable ,</l>
       <l n="93">That did direct him well ,</l>
       <l n="94">Lured from his gelid North which wrought him wrong ,</l>

       <l n="96">By happy instincts inappeasable ,</l>
       <l n="97">Ah yes ! that led him well ,</l>
       <l n="98">Lured to the untried regions and the new</l>

       <l n="100">To twitter there , and in his singing dwell .</l>

       <l n="102">With grieving skies o'ercast ,</l>
       <l n="103">For such migration my poor wing was strong</l>

       <l n="107">But from your mind 's chilled sky</l>

       <l n="127">Chastest , since such you are ,</l>
       <l n="128">Take this curbed spirit of mine ,</l>
       <l n="129">Which your own eyes invest with light divine ,</l>
       <l n="130">For lofty love and high auxiliar</l>

       <l n="132">Which outsoars mortal eyes ;</l>
       <l n="133">This soul which on your soul is laid ,</l>
       <l n="134">As maid 's breast against breast of maid ;</l>
       <l n="135">Beholding how your own I have engraved</l>
       <l n="136">On it , and with what purging thoughts have laved</l>
       <l n="137">This love of mine from all mortality</l>
       <l n="138">Indeed the copy is a painful one ,</l>
       <l n="139">And with long labour done !</l>
       <l n="140">O if you doubt the thing you are , lady ,</l>
       <l n="141">Come then , and look in me ;</l>
       <l n="142">Your beauty , Dian , dress and contemplate</l>

       <l n="144">And purples it to wine ;</l>
       <l n="145">While I behold how ermined Artemis</l>
       <l n="146">Ordained weed must wear ,</l>
       <l n="147">And toil thy business ;</l>

      <head>A JUDGMENT IN HEAVEN { 1 }</head>
       <l n="1">Athwart the sod which is treading for God * the poet paced with his</l>
       <l n="2">splendid eyes ;</l>
       <l n="3">Paradise-verdure he stately passes * to win to the Father of</l>
       <l n="4">Paradise ,</l>
       <l n="5">Through the conscious and palpitant grasses * of inter-tangled</l>
       <l n="6">relucent dyes .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The angels a-play on its fields of Summer * ( their wild wings rustled his guides ’ cymars ) Looked up from disport at the passing comer , * as they pelted each other with handfuls of stars ; And the warden-spirits with startled feet rose , * hand on sword , by their tethered cars .</p>
     <p>With plumes night-tinctured englobed and cinctured , * of Saints , his guided steps held on To where on the far crystelline pale * of that transtellar Heaven there shone The immutable crocean dawn * effusing from the Father 's Throne .</p>
     <p>Through the reverberant Eden-ways * the bruit of his great advent driven , Back from the fulgent justle and press * with mighty echoing so was given , As when the surly thunder smites * upon the clanged gates of Heaven .</p>
     <p>Over the bickering gonfalons , * far-ranged as for Tartarean wars , Went a waver of ribbed fire *— as night-seas on phosphoric bars Like a flame-plumed fan shake slowly out * their ridgy reach of crumbling stars .</p>
     <p>At length to where on His fretted Throne * sat in the heart of His aged dominions The great Triune , and Mary nigh , * lit round with spears of their hauberked minions , The poet drew , in the thunderous blue * involved dread of those mounted pinions .</p>
     <p>As in a secret and tenebrous cloud * the watcher from the disquiet earth At momentary intervals * beholds from its ragged rifts break forth The flash of a golden perturbation , * the travelling threat of a witched birth ;</p>
     <p>Till heavily parts a sinister chasm , * a grisly jaw , whose verges soon , Slowly and ominously filled * by the on-coming plenilune , Supportlessly congest with fire , * and suddenly spit forth the moon : -</p>
     <p>With beauty , not terror , through tangled error * of night-dipt plumes so burned their charge ; Swayed and parted the globing clusters * so ,— disclosed from their kindling marge , Roseal-chapleted , splendent-vestured , * the singer there where God 's light lay large .</p>
     <p>Hu , hu ! a wonder ! a wonder ! see , * clasping the singer 's glories clings A dingy creature , even to laughter * cloaked and clad in patchwork things , Shrinking close from the unused glows * of the seraphs ’ versicoloured wings .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A rhymer , rhyming a futile rhyme , * he had crept for convoy through</l>
       <l n="2">Eden-ways</l>
       <l n="3">Into the shade of the poet 's glory , * darkened under his prevalent</l>
       <l n="4">rays ,</l>
       <l n="5">Fearfully hoping a distant welcome * as a poor kinsman of his lays .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">The angels laughed with a lovely scorning : *— “ Who has done this</l>
       <l n="7">sorry deed in</l>
       <l n="8">The garden of our Father , God ? * ‘ mid his blossoms to sow this weed</l>
       <l n="9">in ?</l>
       <l n="10">Never our fingers knew this stuff : * not so fashion the looms of</l>
       <l n="11">Eden ! ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The singer bowed his brow majestic , * searching that patchwork through and through , Feeling God 's lucent gazes traverse * his singing-stoling and spirit too : The hallowed harpers were fain to frown * on the strange thing come ‘ mid their sacred crew , Only the singer that was earth * his fellow-earth and his own self knew .</p>
     <p>But the poet rent off robe and wreath , * so as a sloughing serpent doth , Laid them at the rhymer 's feet , * shed down wreath and raiment both , Stood in a dim and shamed stole , * like the tattered wing of a musty moth .</p>
     <p>“ Thou gav'st the weed and wreath of song , * the weed and wreath are solely Thine , And this dishonest vesture * is the only vesture that is mine ; The life I textured , Thou the song *— MY handicraft is not divine ! ”</p>
     <p>He wrested o'er the rhymer 's head * that garmenting which wrought him wrong ; A flickering tissue argentine * down dripped its shivering silvers long : -  “ Better thou wov'st thy woof of life * than thou didst weave thy woof of song ! ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Never a chief in Saintdom was , * but turned him from the Poet then ;</l>
       <l n="2">Never an eye looked mild on him * ‘ mid all the angel myriads ten ,</l>
       <l n="3">Save sinless Mary , and sinful Mary *— the Mary titled Magdalen .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Turn yon robe , ” spake Magdalen , * “ of torn bright song , and see and feel . ” They turned the raiment , saw and felt * what their turning did reveal -  All the inner surface piled * with bloodied hairs , like hairs of steel .</p>
     <p>“ Take , I pray , yon chaplet up , * thrown down ruddied from his head . ” They took the roseal chaplet up , * and they stood astonished : Every leaf between their fingers , * as they bruised it , burst and bled .</p>
     <p>“ See his torn flesh through those rents ; * see the punctures round his hair , As if the chaplet-flowers had driven * deep roots in to nourish there -  Lord , who gav'st him robe and wreath , * WHAT was this Thou gav'st for wear ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Fetch forth the Paradisal garb ! ” * spake the Father , sweet and low ; Drew them both by the frightened hand * where Mary 's throne made irised bow -  “ Take , Princess Mary , of thy good grace , * two spirits greater than they know . ”</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">You , O the piteous you !</l>
       <l n="2">Who all the long night through</l>
       <l n="3">Anticipatedly</l>
       <l n="4">Disclose yourself to me</l>
       <l n="5">Already in the ways</l>
       <l n="6">Beyond our human comfortable days ;</l>
       <l n="7">How can you deem what Death</l>
       <l n="8">Impitiably saith</l>
       <l n="9">To me , who listening wake</l>
       <l n="10">For your poor sake ?</l>
       <l n="11">When a grown woman dies</l>
       <l n="12">You know we think unceasingly</l>
       <l n="13">What things she said , how sweet , how wise ;</l>
       <l n="14">And these do make our misery .</l>
       <l n="15">But you were ( you to me</l>
       <l n="16">The dead anticipatedly ! )</l>
       <l n="17">You — eleven years , was't not , or so ? -</l>
       <l n="18">Were just a child , you know ;</l>
       <l n="19">And so you never said</l>
       <l n="20">Things sweet immeditatably and wise</l>
       <l n="21">To interdict from closure my wet eyes :</l>
       <l n="22">But foolish things , my dead , my dead !</l>
       <l n="23">Little and laughable ,</l>
       <l n="24">Your age that fitted well .</l>
       <l n="25">And was it such things all unmemorable ,</l>
       <l n="26">Was it such things could make</l>
       <l n="27">Me sob all night for your implacable sake ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="28">Yet , as you said to me ,</l>
       <l n="29">In pretty make-believe of revelry ,</l>
       <l n="30">So the night long said Death</l>
       <l n="31">With his magniloquent breath ;</l>
       <l n="32">( And that remembered laughter</l>
       <l n="33">Which in our daily uses followed after ,</l>
       <l n="34">Was all untuned to pity and to awe ):</l>
       <l n="35">“ A cup of chocolate ,</l>
       <l n="36">One farthing is the rate ,</l>
       <l n="37">You drink it through a straw . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="38">How could I know , how know</l>
       <l n="39">Those laughing words when drenched with sobbing so ?</l>
       <l n="40">Another voice than yours , than yours , he hath !</l>
       <l n="41">My dear , was't worth his breath ,</l>
       <l n="42">His mighty utterance ?— yet he saith , and saith !</l>
       <l n="43">This dreadful Death to his own dreadfulness</l>
       <l n="44">Doth dreadful wrong ,</l>
       <l n="45">This dreadful childish babble on his tongue !</l>
       <l n="46">That iron tongue made to speak sentences ,</l>
       <l n="47">And wisdom insupportably complete ,</l>
       <l n="48">Why should it only say the long night through ,</l>
       <l n="49">In mimicry of you , -</l>
       <l n="50">“ A cup of chocolate ,</l>
       <l n="51">One farthing is the rate ,</l>
       <l n="52">You drink it through a straw , a straw , a straw ! ”</l>
       <l n="53">Oh , of all sentences ,</l>
       <l n="54">Piercingly incomplete !</l>
       <l n="55">Why did you teach that fatal mouth to draw ,</l>
       <l n="56">Child , impermissible awe ,</l>
       <l n="57">From your old trivialness ?</l>
       <l n="58">Why have you done me this</l>
       <l n="59">Most unsustainable wrong ,</l>
       <l n="60">And into Death 's control</l>
       <l n="61">Betrayed the secret places of my soul ?</l>
       <l n="62">Teaching him that his lips ,</l>
       <l n="63">Uttering their native earthquake and eclipse ,</l>
       <l n="64">Could never so avail</l>
       <l n="65">To rend from hem to hem the ultimate veil</l>
       <l n="66">Of this most desolate</l>
       <l n="67">Spirit , and leave it stripped and desecrate , -</l>
       <l n="68">Nay , never so have wrung</l>
       <l n="69">From eyes and speech weakness unmanned , unmeet ;</l>
       <l n="70">As when his terrible dotage to repeat</l>
       <l n="71">Its little lesson learneth at your feet ;</l>
       <l n="72">As when he sits among</l>
       <l n="73">His sepulchres , to play</l>
       <l n="74">With broken toys your hand has cast away ,</l>
       <l n="75">With derelict trinkets of the darling young .</l>
       <l n="76">Why have you taught — that he might so complete</l>
       <l n="77">His awful panoply</l>
       <l n="78">From your cast playthings — why ,</l>
       <l n="79">This dreadful childish babble to his tongue ,</l>
       <l n="80">Dreadful and sweet ?</l>
