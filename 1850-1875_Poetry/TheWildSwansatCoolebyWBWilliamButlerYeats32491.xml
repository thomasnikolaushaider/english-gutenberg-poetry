    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">This book is , in part , a reprint of The Wild Swans at Coole , printed a year ago on my sister 's hand-press at Dundrum , Co. Dublin . I have not , however , reprinted a play which may be a part of a book of new plays suggested by the dance plays of Japan , and I have added a number of new poems . Michael Robartes and John Aherne , whose names occur in one or other of these , are characters in some stories I wrote years ago , who have once again become a part of the phantasmagoria through which I can alone express my convictions about the world . I have the fancy that I read the name John Aherne among those of men prosecuted for making a disturbance at the first production of “ The Play Boy , ” which may account for his animosity to myself .</p>

    <p n="2">When I was a child at Sligo I could see above my grandfather 's trees a little column of smoke from “ the pern mill , ” and was told that “ pern ” was another name for the spool , as I was accustomed to call it , on which thread was wound . One could not see the chimney for the trees , and the smoke looked as if it came from the mountain , and one day a foreign sea-captain asked me if that was a burning mountain .</p>
