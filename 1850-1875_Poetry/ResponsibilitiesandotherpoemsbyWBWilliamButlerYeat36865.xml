     <l n="6">Pardon , old fathers , if you still remain</l>
     <l n="7">Somewhere in ear-shot for the story 's end ,</l>
     <l n="8">Old Dublin merchant ‘ free of ten and four ’</l>
     <l n="9">Or trading out of Galway into Spain ;</l>
     <l n="10">And country scholar , Robert Emmet 's friend ,</l>
     <l n="11">A hundred-year-old memory to the poor ;</l>
     <l n="12">Traders or soldiers who have left me blood</l>
     <l n="13">That has not passed through any huxter 's loin ,</l>
     <l n="14">Pardon , and you that did not weigh the cost ,</l>
     <l n="15">Old Butlers when you took to horse and stood</l>
     <l n="16">Beside the brackish waters of the Boyne</l>
     <l n="17">Till your bad master blenched and all was lost ;</l>
     <l n="18">You merchant skipper that leaped overboard</l>
     <l n="19">After a ragged hat in Biscay Bay ,</l>
     <l n="20">You most of all , silent and fierce old man</l>
     <l n="21">Because you were the spectacle that stirred</l>
     <l n="22">My fancy , and set my boyish lips to say</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Only the wasteful virtues earn the sun ’ ;</l>
     <l n="24">Pardon that for a barren passion 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="25">Although I have come close on forty-nine</l>
     <l n="26">I have no child , I have nothing but a book ,</l>
     <l n="27">Nothing but that to prove your blood and mine .</l>

     <l n="29">Poets with whom I learned my trade ,</l>
     <l n="30">Companions of the Cheshire Cheese ,</l>
     <l n="31">Here 's an old story I 've re-made ,</l>
     <l n="32">Imagining ‘ twould better please</l>
     <l n="33">Your ears than stories now in fashion ,</l>
     <l n="34">Though you may think I waste my breath</l>
     <l n="35">Pretending that there can be passion</l>
     <l n="36">That has more life in it than death ,</l>
     <l n="37">And though at bottling of your wine</l>
     <l n="38">The bow-legged Goban had no say ;</l>
     <l n="39">The moral 's yours because it 's mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="40">When cups went round at close of day —</l>
     <l n="41">Is not that how good stories run ?—</l>
     <l n="42">Somewhere within some hollow hill ,</l>
     <l n="43">If books speak truth in Slievenamon ,</l>
     <l n="44">But let that be , the gods were still</l>
     <l n="45">And sleepy , having had their meal ,</l>
     <l n="46">And smoky torches made a glare</l>
     <l n="47">On painted pillars , on a deal</l>
     <l n="48">Of fiddles and of flutes hung there</l>
     <l n="49">By the ancient holy hands that brought them</l>
     <l n="50">From murmuring Murias , on cups —</l>
     <l n="51">Old Goban hammered them and wrought them ,</l>
     <l n="52">And put his pattern round their tops</l>
     <l n="53">To hold the wine they buy of him .</l>
     <l n="54">But from the juice that made them wise</l>
     <l n="55">All those had lifted up the dim</l>
     <l n="56">Imaginations of their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="57">For one that was like woman made</l>
     <l n="58">Before their sleepy eyelids ran</l>
     <l n="59">And trembling with her passion said ,</l>
     <l n="60">‘ Come out and dig for a dead man ,</l>
     <l n="61">Who 's burrowing somewhere in the ground ,</l>
     <l n="62">And mock him to his face and then</l>
     <l n="63">Hollo him on with horse and hound ,</l>
     <l n="64">For he is the worst of all dead men . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">We should be dazed and terror struck ,</l>
     <l n="66">If we but saw in dreams that room ,</l>
     <l n="67">Those wine-drenched eyes , and curse our luck</l>
     <l n="68">That emptied all our days to come .</l>
     <l n="69">I knew a woman none could please ,</l>
     <l n="70">Because she dreamed when but a child</l>
     <l n="71">Of men and women made like these ;</l>
     <l n="72">And after , when her blood ran wild ,</l>
     <l n="73">Had ravelled her own story out ,</l>
     <l n="74">And said , ‘ In two or in three years</l>
     <l n="75">I need must marry some poor lout , ’</l>
     <l n="76">And having said it burst in tears .</l>
     <l n="77">Since , tavern comrades , you have died ,</l>
     <l n="78">Maybe your images have stood ,</l>
     <l n="79">Mere bone and muscle thrown aside ,</l>
     <l n="80">Before that roomful or as good .</l>
     <l n="81">You had to face your ends when young —</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Twas wine or women , or some curse —</l>
     <l n="83">But never made a poorer song</l>
     <l n="84">That you might have a heavier purse ,</l>
     <l n="85">Nor gave loud service to a cause</l>
     <l n="86">That you might have a troop of friends .</l>
     <l n="87">You kept the Muses ’ sterner laws ,</l>
     <l n="88">And unrepenting faced your ends ,</l>
     <l n="89">And therefore earned the right — and yet</l>
     <l n="90">Dowson and Johnson most I praise —</l>
     <l n="91">To troop with those the world 's forgot ,</l>
     <l n="92">And copy their proud steady gaze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="93">‘ The Danish troop was driven out</l>
     <l n="94">Between the dawn and dusk , ’ she said ;</l>

     <l n="96">Although the King of Ireland 's dead</l>
     <l n="97">And half the kings , before sundown</l>
     <l n="98">All was accomplished . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="99">‘ When this day</l>
     <l n="100">Murrough , the King of Ireland 's son ,</l>
     <l n="101">Foot after foot was giving way ,</l>
     <l n="102">He and his best troops back to back</l>
     <l n="103">Had perished there , but the Danes ran ,</l>
     <l n="104">Stricken with panic from the attack ,</l>
     <l n="105">The shouting of an unseen man ;</l>
     <l n="106">And being thankful Murrough found ,</l>
     <l n="107">Led by a footsole dipped in blood</l>
     <l n="108">That had made prints upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="109">Where by old thorn trees that man stood ;</l>
     <l n="110">And though when he gazed here and there ,</l>
     <l n="111">He had but gazed on thorn trees , spoke ,</l>
     <l n="112">“ Who is the friend that seems but air</l>
     <l n="113">And yet could give so fine a stroke ? ”</l>
     <l n="114">Thereon a young man met his eye ,</l>
     <l n="115">Who said , “ Because she held me in</l>
     <l n="116">Her love , and would not have me die ,</l>
     <l n="117">Rock-nurtured Aoife took a pin ,</l>
     <l n="118">And pushing it into my shirt ,</l>
     <l n="119">Promised that for a pin 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="120">No man should see to do me hurt ;</l>
     <l n="121">But there it 's gone ; I will not take</l>
     <l n="122">The fortune that had been my shame</l>
     <l n="123">Seeing , King 's son , what wounds you have . ”</l>
     <l n="124">‘ Twas roundly spoke , but when night came</l>
     <l n="125">He had betrayed me to his grave ,</l>
     <l n="126">For he and the King 's son were dead .</l>
     <l n="127">I 'd promised him two hundred years ,</l>
     <l n="128">And when for all I 'd done or said —</l>
     <l n="129">And these immortal eyes shed tears —</l>
     <l n="130">He claimed his country 's need was most ,</l>
     <l n="131">I 'd save his life , yet for the sake</l>
     <l n="132">Of a new friend he has turned a ghost .</l>
     <l n="133">What does he care if my heart break ?</l>
     <l n="134">I call for spade and horse and hound</l>
     <l n="135">That we may harry him . ’ Thereon</l>
     <l n="136">She cast herself upon the ground</l>
     <l n="137">And rent her clothes and made her moan :</l>
     <l n="138">‘ Why are they faithless when their might</l>
     <l n="139">Is from the holy shades that rove</l>
     <l n="140">The grey rock and the windy light ?</l>
     <l n="141">Why should the faithfullest heart most love</l>
     <l n="142">The bitter sweetness of false faces ?</l>
     <l n="143">Why must the lasting love what passes ,</l>
     <l n="144">Why are the gods by men betrayed ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="145">But thereon every god stood up</l>
     <l n="146">With a slow smile and without sound ,</l>
     <l n="147">And stretching forth his arm and cup</l>
     <l n="148">To where she moaned upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="149">Suddenly drenched her to the skin ;</l>
     <l n="150">And she with Goban 's wine adrip ,</l>
     <l n="151">No more remembering what had been ,</l>
     <l n="152">Stared at the gods with laughing lip .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="153">I have kept my faith , though faith was tried ,</l>
     <l n="154">To that rock-born , rock-wandering foot ,</l>

     <l n="156">And I am in no good repute</l>
     <l n="157">With the loud host before the sea ,</l>
     <l n="158">That think sword strokes were better meant</l>

    <p>THE TWO KINGS</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="161">King Eochaid came at sundown to a wood</l>
     <l n="162">Westward of Tara . Hurrying to his queen</l>
     <l n="163">He had out-ridden his war-wasted men</l>
     <l n="164">That with empounded cattle trod the mire ;</l>
     <l n="165">And where beech trees had mixed a pale green light</l>
     <l n="166">With the ground-ivy 's blue , he saw a stag</l>
     <l n="167">Whiter than curds , its eyes the tint of the sea .</l>
     <l n="168">Because it stood upon his path and seemed</l>
     <l n="169">More hands in height than any stag in the world</l>
     <l n="170">He sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth</l>
     <l n="171">Upon his trembling horse , then drove the spur ;</l>
     <l n="172">But the stag stooped and ran at him , and passed ,</l>
     <l n="173">Rending the horse 's flank . King Eochaid reeled</l>
     <l n="174">Then drew his sword to hold its levelled point</l>
     <l n="175">Against the stag . When horn and steel were met</l>
     <l n="176">The horn resounded as though it had been silver ,</l>
     <l n="177">A sweet , miraculous , terrifying sound .</l>
     <l n="178">Horn locked in sword , they tugged and struggled there</l>
     <l n="179">As though a stag and unicorn were met</l>
     <l n="180">In Africa on Mountain of the Moon ,</l>
     <l n="181">Until at last the double horns , drawn backward ,</l>
     <l n="182">Butted below the single and so pierced</l>
     <l n="183">The entrails of the horse . Dropping his sword</l>
     <l n="184">King Eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands</l>
     <l n="185">And stared into the sea-green eye , and so</l>
     <l n="186">Hither and thither to and fro they trod</l>
     <l n="187">Till all the place was beaten into mire .</l>
     <l n="188">The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met ,</l>
     <l n="189">The hands that gathered up the might of the world ,</l>
     <l n="190">And hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed</l>
     <l n="191">Amid the elaborate wilderness of the air .</l>
     <l n="192">Through bush they plunged and over ivied root ,</l>
     <l n="193">And where the stone struck fire , while in the leaves</l>
     <l n="194">A squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out ;</l>
     <l n="195">But when at last he forced those sinewy flanks</l>
     <l n="196">Against a beech bole , he threw down the beast</l>
     <l n="197">And knelt above it with drawn knife . On the instant</l>
     <l n="198">It vanished like a shadow , and a cry</l>
     <l n="199">So mournful that it seemed the cry of one</l>
     <l n="200">Who had lost some unimaginable treasure</l>
     <l n="201">Wandered between the blue and the green leaf</l>
     <l n="202">And climbed into the air , crumbling away ,</l>
     <l n="203">Till all had seemed a shadow or a vision</l>
     <l n="204">But for the trodden mire , the pool of blood ,</l>
     <l n="205">The disembowelled horse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="206">King Eochaid ran ,</l>
     <l n="207">Toward peopled Tara , nor stood to draw his breath</l>
     <l n="208">Until he came before the painted wall ,</l>
     <l n="209">The posts of polished yew , circled with bronze ,</l>
     <l n="210">Of the great door ; but though the hanging lamps</l>
     <l n="211">Showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows ,</l>
     <l n="212">Nor door , nor mouth , nor slipper made a noise ,</l>

     <l n="218">Knowing that silence brings no good to kings ,</l>

     <l n="220">Between the pillars with a beating heart</l>
     <l n="221">And saw where in the midst of the great hall</l>
     <l n="222">Pale-faced , alone upon a bench , Edain</l>
     <l n="223">Sat upright with a sword before her feet .</l>
     <l n="224">Her hands on either side had gripped the bench ,</l>
     <l n="225">Her eyes were cold and steady , her lips tight .</l>
     <l n="226">Some passion had made her stone . Hearing a foot</l>
     <l n="227">She started and then knew whose foot it was ;</l>
     <l n="228">But when he thought to take her in his arms</l>
     <l n="229">She motioned him afar , and rose and spoke :</l>

     <l n="236">Will never look again on known man 's face . ’</l>
     <l n="237">And at these words he paled , as she had paled ,</l>
     <l n="238">Knowing that he should find upon her lips</l>
     <l n="239">The meaning of that monstrous day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="240">Then she :</l>
     <l n="241">‘ You brought me where your brother Ardan sat</l>

     <l n="243">Through that strange illness that had fixed him there ,</l>
     <l n="244">And should he die to heap his burial mound</l>

     <l n="249">‘ I bid them make his bed under this roof</l>
     <l n="250">And carried him his food with my own hands ,</l>
     <l n="251">And so the weeks passed by . But when I said</l>
     <l n="252">“ What is this trouble ? ” he would answer nothing ,</l>
     <l n="253">Though always at my words his trouble grew ;</l>
     <l n="254">And I but asked the more , till he cried out ,</l>
     <l n="255">Weary of many questions : “ There are things</l>
     <l n="256">That make the heart akin to the dumb stone . ”</l>
     <l n="257">Then I replied : “ Although you hide a secret ,</l>

     <l n="259">Speak it , that I may send through the wide world</l>
     <l n="260">For medicine . ” Thereon he cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="261">“ Day after day you question me , and I ,</l>

     <l n="263">I shall be carried in the gust , command ,</l>

     <l n="269">And loosen on us dreams that waste our life ,</l>
     <l n="270">Shadows and shows that can but turn the brain . ”</l>
     <l n="271">But finding him still silent I stooped down</l>
     <l n="272">And whispering that none but he should hear ,</l>
     <l n="273">Said : “ If a woman has put this on you ,</l>
     <l n="274">My men , whether it please her or displease ,</l>
     <l n="275">And though they have to cross the Loughlan waters</l>
     <l n="276">And take her in the middle of armed men ,</l>
     <l n="277">Shall make her look upon her handiwork ,</l>
     <l n="278">That she may quench the rick she has fired ; and though</l>
     <l n="279">She may have worn silk clothes , or worn a crown ,</l>
     <l n="280">She 'll not be proud , knowing within her heart</l>

     <l n="283">Happiness to children and to men . ”</l>
     <l n="284">Then he , driven by his thought beyond his thought ,</l>
     <l n="285">And speaking what he would not though he would ,</l>
     <l n="286">Sighed : “ You , even you yourself , could work the cure ! ”</l>

     <l n="343">That made the body seem as it were a string</l>
     <l n="344">Under a bow , he cried : “ What happiness</l>

When I went by Tubbervanach , where the young men used to be climbing the hill to the blessed well , they were sitting at the cross-roads playing cards . When I went by Carrigoras , where the friars used to be fasting and serving the poor , I saw them drinking wine and obeying their wives .

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">PREFATORY POEM</p>
    <p n="2">‘ Free of the ten and four ’ is an error I cannot now correct , without more rewriting than I have a mind for . Some merchant in Villon , I forget the reference , was ‘ free of the ten and four . ’ Irish merchants exempted from certain duties by the Irish Parliament were , unless memory deceives me again for I am writing away from books , ‘ free of the eight and six . ’</p>
    <p n="3">POEMS BEGINNING WITH THAT ‘ TO A WEALTHY MAN ’ AND ENDING WITH THAT ‘ TO A SHADE ’</p>
    <p n="4">During the thirty years or so during which I have been reading Irish newspapers , three public controversies have stirred my imagination . The first was the Parnell controversy . There were reasons to justify a man 's joining either party , but there were none to justify , on one side or on the other , lying accusations forgetful of past service , a frenzy of detraction . And another was the dispute over ‘ The Playboy . ’ There were reasons for opposing as for supporting that violent , laughing thing , but none for the lies , for the unscrupulous rhetoric spread against it in Ireland , and from Ireland to America . The third prepared for the Corporation 's refusal of a building for Sir Hugh Lane 's famous collection of pictures .</p>
    <p n="5">One could respect the argument that Dublin , with much poverty and many slums , could not afford the L22 , 000 the building was to cost the city , but not the minds that used it . One frenzied man compared the pictures to Troy horse which ‘ destroyed a city , ’ and innumerable correspondents described Sir Hugh Lane and those who had subscribed many thousands to give Dublin paintings by Corot , Manet , Monet , Degas , and Renoir , as ‘ self-seekers , ’ ‘ self-advertisers , ’ ‘ picture-dealers , ’ ‘ log-rolling cranks and faddists , ’ and one clerical paper told ‘ picture-dealer Lane ’ to take himself and his pictures out of that . A member of the Corporation said there were Irish artists who could paint as good if they had a mind to , and another described a half-hour in the temporary gallery in Harcourt Street as the most dismal of his life . Some one else asked instead of these eccentric pictures to be given pictures ‘ like those beautiful productions displayed in the windows of our city picture shops . ’ Another thought that we would all be more patriotic if we devoted our energy to fighting the Insurance Act . Another would not hang them in his kitchen , while yet another described the vogue of French impressionist painting as having gone to such a length among ‘ log-rolling enthusiasts ’ that they even admired ‘ works that were rejected from the Salon forty years ago by the finest critics in the world . ’</p>
    <p n="6">The first serious opposition began in the Irish Catholic , the chief Dublin clerical paper , and Mr. William Murphy , the organiser of the recent lock-out and Mr. Healy 's financial supporter in his attack upon Parnell , a man of great influence , brought to its support a few days later his newspapers The Evening Herald and The Irish Independent , the most popular of Irish daily papers . He replied to my poem ‘ To a Wealthy Man ’ ( I was thinking of a very different wealthy man ) from what he described as ‘ Paudeen 's point of view , ’ and ‘ Paudeen 's point of view ’ it was . The enthusiasm for ‘ Sir Hugh Lane 's Corots ’ — one paper spelled the name repeatedly ‘ Crot ’ — being but ‘ an exotic fashion , ’ waited ‘ some satirist like Gilbert ’ who ‘ killed the aesthetic craze , ’ and as for the rest ‘ there were no greater humbugs in the world than art critics and so-called experts . ’ As the first avowed reason for opposition , the necessities of the poor got but a few lines , not so many certainly as the objection of various persons to supply Sir Hugh Lane with ‘ a monument at the city 's expense , ’ and as the gallery was supported by Mr. James Larkin , the chief Labour leader , and important slum workers , I assume that the purpose of the opposition was not exclusively charitable .</p>
    <p n="7">These controversies , political , literary , and artistic , have showed that neither religion nor politics can of itself create minds with enough receptivity to become wise , or just and generous enough to make a nation . Other cities have been as stupid — Samuel Butler laughs at shocked Montreal for hiding the Discobolus in a cellar — but Dublin is the capital of a nation , and an ancient race has nowhere else to look for an education . Goethe in Wilhelm Meister describes a saintly and naturally gracious woman , who getting into a quarrel over some trumpery detail of religious observance , grows — she and all her little religious community — angry and vindictive . In Ireland I am constantly reminded of that fable of the futility of all discipline that is not of the whole being . Religious Ireland — and the pious Protestants of my childhood were signal examples — thinks of divine things as a round of duties separated from life and not as an element that may be discovered in all circumstance and emotion , while political Ireland sees the good citizen but as a man who holds to certain opinions and not as a man of good will . Against all this we have but a few educated men and the remnants of an old traditional culture among the poor . Both were stronger forty years ago , before the rise of our new middle class which showed as its first public event , during the nine years of the Parnellite split , how base at moments of excitement are minds without culture . 1914 .</p>
    <p n="8">‘ Romantic Ireland 's dead and gone ’ sounds old-fashioned now . It seemed true in 1913 , but I did not foresee 1916 . The late Dublin Rebellion , whatever one can say of its wisdom , will long be remembered for its heroism . ‘ They weighed so lightly what they gave , ’ and gave too in some cases without hope of success . July 1916 .</p>
    <p n="9">THE DOLLS</p>
    <p n="10">The fable for this poem came into my head while I was giving some lectures in Dublin . I had noticed once again how all thought among us is frozen into ‘ something other than human life . ’ After I had made the poem , I looked up one day into the blue of the sky , and suddenly imagined , as if lost in the blue of the sky , stiff figures in procession . I remembered that they were the habitual image suggested by blue sky , and looking for a second fable called them ‘ The Magi ’ , complimentary forms to those enraged dolls .</p>
    <p n="11">THE HOUR-GLASS</p>
    <p n="12">A friend suggested to me the subject of this play , an Irish folk-tale from Lady Wilde 's Ancient Legends . I have for years struggled with something which is charming in the naive legend but a platitude on the stage . I did not discover till a year ago that if the wise man humbled himself to the fool and received salvation as his reward , so much more powerful are pictures than words , no explanatory dialogue could set the matter right . I was faintly pleased when I converted a music-hall singer and kept him going to Mass for six weeks , so little responsibility does one feel for those to whom one has never been introduced ; but I was always ashamed when I saw any friend of my own in the theatre . Now I have made my philosopher accept God 's will , whatever it is , and find his courage again , and helped by the elaboration of verse , have so changed the fable that it is not false to my own thoughts of the world .</p>

    <p n="32">Decorated cloth , 12mo , $ 1. 25</p>
    <p n="33">The initial piece in this volume is a deliciously conceived heroic farce , quaint in humor and sprightly in action . It tells of the difficulty in which two simple Irish folk find themselves when they enter into an agreement with an apparition of the sea , who demands that they knock off his head and who maintains that after they have done that he will knock off theirs . There is a real meaning in the play which it will not take the thoughtful reader long to discover . Besides this there are a number of shorter poems , notably one in which Mr. Yeats answers the critics of “ The Playboy of the Western World . ”</p>

    <p>Author of “ The Song of Hugh Glass ” Here are brought together the more important of Mr. Neihardt 's poems . For some years there have been those — and prominent critics , too — who have quite emphatically maintained that there is no greater American poet than Mr. Neihardt , that in him are found those essentials which make for true art — a feeling for words , a lyric power of the first quality , an understanding of rhythm . Here , for example , is the comment of the Boston Transcript on the book just preceding this , The Song of Hugh Glass : “ In this poem Mr. Neihardt touches life , power , beauty , spirit ; the tremendous and impressive forces of nature .... The genius of American poetry is finding itself in such a poem as this .... The poem is powerfully poetic .... It is a big , sweeping thing blazing a pathway across the frontiers of our national life . ” Californians By ROBINSON JEFFERS California is now to have its part in the poetry revival . Robinson Jeffers is a new poet , a man whose name is as yet unknown but whose work is of such outstanding character that once it is read he is sure of acceptance by those who have admired the writings of such men as John G. Neihardt , Edgar Lee Masters , Edwin Arlington Robinson and Thomas Walsh . Virtually all of the poems in this first collection have their setting in California , most of them in the Monterey peninsula , and they realize the scenery of the great State with vividness and richness of detail . The author 's main source of inspiration has been the varying aspects of nature . THE MACMILLAN COMPANY Publishers 64-66 Fifth Avenue New York Poems of the Great War By J. W. CUNLIFFE Here are brought together under the editorship of Dr. Cunliffe some of the more notable poems which have dealt with the great war . Among the writers represented are Rupert Brooke , John Masefield , Lincoln Colcord , William Benet , Wilfrid Wilson Gibson , Hermann Hagedorn , Alfred Noyes , Rabindranath Tagore , Walter De La Mare , Vachel Lindsay and Owen Seaman . The New Poetry : An Anthology Edited by HARRIET MONROE and ALICE CORBIN HENDERSON , Editors of Poetry Probably few people are following as closely the poetry of to-day as are the editors of the Poetry Magazine of Chicago . They are eminently fitted , therefore , to prepare such a volume as this , which is intended to represent the work that is being done by the leading poets of the land . Here , between the covers of one book , are brought together poems by a great many different writers , all of whom may be said to be responsible in a measure for the revival of interest in poetry in this country . The Story of Eleusis By LOUIS V. LEDOUX This is a lyrical drama , in the Greek manner , dealing with the story of Persephone . Mr. Ledoux has constructed such a play as might well have held the attention of the assembled mystae at Eleusis . It is Greek . Better than this , it is also human . Its beauty and its truthfulness to life will appeal alike to the lover of classical and the lover of modern dramatic poetry . THE MACMILLAN COMPANY Publishers 64-66 Fifth Avenue New York</p>
