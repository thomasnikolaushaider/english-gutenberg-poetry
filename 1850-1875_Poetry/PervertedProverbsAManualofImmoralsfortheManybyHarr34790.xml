     <l n="3">Do you recall those bygone days ,</l>
     <l n="4">When you received with kindly praise</l>
     <l n="5">My bantling book of Rhyme ?</l>
     <l n="6">Praise undeserved , alas ! and yet</l>
     <l n="7">How sweet ! For , tho ’ we had not met ,</l>
     <l n="8">( Ah ! what a waste of time ! )</l>
     <l n="9">I could the more enjoy such mercies</l>
     <l n="10">Since I delighted in your verses .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">And when a Poet stoops to smile</l>
     <l n="12">On some one of the rank and file ,</l>
     <l n="13">( Inglorious — if not mute ,)</l>
     <l n="14">Some groundling bard who craves to climb ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like me , the dizzy rungs of Rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="16">To reach the Golden Fruit ;</l>
     <l n="17">For one in such a situation</l>

     <l n="29">Beneath its crown of bays ;</l>
     <l n="30">Your eyes may sparkle like a star ,</l>
     <l n="31">With friendship , that is dearer far</l>
     <l n="32">Than any breath of praise ;</l>
     <l n="33">The which a lucky man possessing</l>
     <l n="34">Can ask no higher human blessing .</l>

     <l n="41">And , if I earn your approbation ,</l>

     <l n="10">Quite realizing that my Style</l>
     <l n="11">Makes up for any lack of Morals ;</l>
     <l n="12">For which I feel no shred of shame —</l>

     <l n="14">I do n't intend a Child to read</l>
     <l n="15">These lines , which are not for the Young ;</l>

     <l n="22">Accept the Moral with the Rhyme ,</l>

     <l n="24">But , if you can n't , it wo n't hurt me !</l>
     <l n="25">( And Browning would , I know , agree . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">Be reassured , I have not got</l>
     <l n="27">The style of Stephen Phillips ’ heroes ,</l>

     <l n="35">Nor call the homely thrush a “ throstle . ”</l>
     <l n="36">Such synonyms would make me smile .</l>
     <l n="37">( And so they would have made Carlyle . )</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="38">My Style may be at times , I own ,</l>
     <l n="39">A trifle cryptic or abstruse ;</l>
     <l n="40">In this I do not stand alone ,</l>
     <l n="41">And need but mention , in excuse ,</l>
     <l n="42">A thousand world-familiar names ,</l>
     <l n="43">From Meredith to Henry James .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="44">From these my fruitless fancy roams</l>
