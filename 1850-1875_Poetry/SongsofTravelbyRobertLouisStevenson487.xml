    <docImprint>The following collection of verses , written at various times and places , principally after the author ’ s final departure from<country>England</country>in<date>1887</date>, was sent home by him for publication some months before his death . He had tried them in several different orders and under several different titles , as “ Songs and Notes of Travel ,” “ Posthumous Poems ,” etc ., and in the end left their naming and arrangement to the present editor , with the suggestion that they should be added as Book III . to future editions of “ Underwoods .” This suggestion it is proposed to carry out ; but in the meantime , for the benefit of those who possess “ Underwoods ” in its original form , it has been thought desirable to publish them separately in the present volume . They have already been included in the Edinburgh Edition of the author ’ s works .</docImprint>

   <p>XXXVII — THE HOUSE OF TEMBINOKA</p>
   <note>At my departure from the island of Apemama , for which you will look in vain in most atlases , the King and I agreed , since we both set up to be in the poetical way , that we should celebrate our separation in verse . Whether or not his Majesty has been true to his bargain , the laggard posts of the Pacific may perhaps inform me in six months , perhaps not before a year . The following lines represent my part of the contract , and it is hoped , by their pictures of strange manners , they may entertain a civilised audience . Nothing throughout has been invented or exaggerated ; the lady herein referred to as the author ’ s muse has confined herself to stringing into rhyme facts or legends that I saw or heard during two months ’ residence upon the island .— R .

     <l n="30">Nodded and brooded , bloomed and dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="31">Unmeaning , undivined . It seemed</l>
