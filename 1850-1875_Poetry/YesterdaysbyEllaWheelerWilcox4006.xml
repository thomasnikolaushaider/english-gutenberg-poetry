    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="1">This little volume might be called ‘ Echoes from the land of youthful imaginings ’ ; or ‘ Ghosts of old dreams . ’ It has been compiled at the request of Messrs . Gay and Hancock ( my only authorised publishers in Great Britain ) , and contains verses written in my early youth , and which never before ( with the exception , perhaps , of three or four ) have been placed in book form .</p>
    <p n="2">Given the poetical temperament , and a lonely environment , with few distractions , youthful imagination is sure to express itself in mournful wails and despairing moans . Such wails and moans will be found to excess in this little book , and will serve to show better than any amount of common-sense reasoning , how fleeting are the sorrows of youth , and how slight the foundation on which the young build towers of despair .</p>
    <p n="3">In the days when these verses were written , each little song represented a few dollars ( to my emaciated purse ) , and so the slightest experience of my own , or of any friend , with every passing mood , every trivial happening , was utilised by my imaginative and thrifty muse .</p>
    <p n="4">That the writer has always possessed robust health , and has lived to a good age , is proof positive that the verses are not all expressions of personal experiences , since no human being could have borne such continual agonies and retained life and reason .</p>
    <p n="5">All the verses in the book were written while I bore the name of Ella Wheeler , and are quite inconsistent with the ideas and philosophy of</p>
    <p n="6">ELLA WHEELER WILCOX .</p>
    <p n="7">August 1910 .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">How young I am ! Ah ! heaven , this curse of youth</l>
       <l n="3">Doth mock me from my mirror with great eyes ,</l>
       <l n="4">And pulsing veins repeat the unwelcome truth ,</l>
       <l n="5">That I must live , though hope within me dies .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">So young , and yet I have had all of life .</l>
       <l n="7">Why , men have lived to see a hundred years ,</l>
       <l n="8">Who have not known the rapture , joy , and strife</l>
       <l n="9">Of my brief youth , its passion and its tears .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Oh ! what are years ? A ripe three score and ten</l>
       <l n="11">Hold often less of life , in its best sense ,</l>
       <l n="12">Than just a twelvemonth lived by other men ,</l>
       <l n="13">Whose high-strung souls are ardent and intense .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">But having seen all depths and scaled all heights ,</l>
       <l n="15">Having a heart love thrilled , and sorrow wrung ,</l>
       <l n="16">Knowing all pains , all pleasures , all delights ,</l>
       <l n="17">Now I would die — but cannot , being young .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">Nothing is left me , but supreme despair ;</l>
       <l n="19">The bitter dregs that tell of wasted wine .</l>
       <l n="20">Come furrowed brow , dull eye , and frosted hair ,</l>
       <l n="21">Companions fit for this old heart of mine .</l>

      <head>WARP AND WOOF</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Through the sunshine , and through the rain</l>
       <l n="2">Of these changing days of mist and splendour ,</l>
       <l n="3">I see the face of a year-old pain</l>
       <l n="4">Looking at me with a smile half tender .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">With a smile half tender , and yet all sad ,</l>
       <l n="6">Into each hour of the mild September</l>
       <l n="7">It comes , and finding my life grown glad</l>
       <l n="8">Looks down in my eyes , and says ‘ Remember . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">Says ‘ Remember , ’ and points behind</l>
       <l n="10">To days of sorrow , and tear-wet lashes ;</l>
       <l n="11">When joy lay dead and hope was blind ,</l>
       <l n="12">And nothing was left but dust and ashes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Dust and ashes and vain regret ,</l>
       <l n="14">Flames fanned out , and the embers falling .</l>
       <l n="15">But the sun of the saddest day must set ,</l>
       <l n="16">And hope wakes ever with Springtime 's calling .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">With Springtime 's calling the pulses thrill ;</l>
       <l n="18">And the heart is tuned to a sweeter measure .</l>
       <l n="19">For never a green Spring crossed the hill</l>
       <l n="20">That came not laden with some new pleasure .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Some new pleasure that brings content ;</l>
       <l n="22">And the heart looks up with a smile of gladness ,</l>
       <l n="23">And wonders idly when sorrow went</l>
       <l n="24">Out of the life that seemed all sadness .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">That seemed all sadness , and yet grew bright</l>
       <l n="26">With colours we thought could tinge it never .</l>
       <l n="27">Yet I think the pain though out of sight ,</l>
       <l n="28">Like the warp of the carpet , is there for ever .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">There for ever , and by and by</l>
       <l n="30">When the woof wears thin , or draws asunder ,</l>
       <l n="31">We see the sombre threads that lie</l>
       <l n="32">Intertwining and twisting under .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Twisting under and binding so</l>
       <l n="34">The brighter threads that they may not sever .</l>
       <l n="35">Thus the pain of a year ago</l>
       <l n="36">Must stay a part of my life for ever .</l>

       <l n="1">The dawn grows red in the eastern sky ,</l>
       <l n="2">( Long , so long is the day ,)</l>
       <l n="3">And I lean from my lattice and sigh and sigh ,</l>
       <l n="4">As I watch the night fog creeping by</l>

       <l n="8">Like liquid silver his music spills ,</l>
       <l n="9">And ever it quivers , and runs , and trills</l>
       <l n="10">In a glad sweet burst of song .</l>

       <l n="14">Of my heart 's sorrows and secret woes ,</l>
       <l n="15">And the red rose sighs , ‘ Ah me ! ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">A ship sails into the waiting bay ,</l>

       <l n="18">But what would that matter to me , I pray</l>
       <l n="19">If the ship that sailed out yesterday</l>
       <l n="20">Should never more come back .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">The summer sun rides high and clear ,</l>
       <l n="22">( The day is long , so long ,)</l>
       <l n="23">How long it must be ere it grows to a year —</l>
       <l n="24">How deep the sorrow that finds no tear ,</l>
       <l n="25">But only a wail of song .</l>

       <l n="3">It always better to look ahead ,</l>

       <l n="2">Like restless children worn out with play ,</l>

       <l n="27">When the skies are veiled and the moon has sailed</l>
       <l n="28">Beyond the horizon 's bar .</l>
