     <head>FORWARD</head>
     <p>The greater part of these verses dealing with the war were written in France during my recent seven months ’ sojourn there , and for the purpose of using in entertainments given in camps and hospitals to thousands of American soldiers .</p>
     <p>They were the result of coming into close contact with the soldiers ’ mind and heart , and were intentionally expressed in the simplest manner , without any consideration of methods approved by modern critics . The fact that I have been asked to autograph scores of copies of many of these verses ( and one of them to the extent of 350 copies ) is more gratifying to me than would be the highest encomiums of the purely literary critic .</p>

      <head>THE BRAVE HIGHLAND LADDIES</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I had seen our splendid soldiers in their khaki uniforms ,</l>
       <l n="2">And their leaders with a Sam Brown belt ;</l>
       <l n="3">I had seen the fighting Britons and Colonials in swarms ,</l>
       <l n="4">I had seen the blue-clad Frenchmen , and I felt</l>
       <l n="5">That the mighty martial show</l>
       <l n="6">Had no new sight to bestow ,</l>
       <l n="7">Till I walked on Piccadilly , and my word !</l>
       <l n="8">By the bonnie Highland laddies</l>
       <l n="9">In their kilts and their plaidies ,</l>
       <l n="10">To a wholly new sensation I was stirred .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">They were like some old-time picture , or a scene from out a play ,</l>
       <l n="12">They were stalwart , they were young , and debonnair ;</l>
       <l n="13">Their jaunty little caps they wore in such a fetching way ,</l>
       <l n="14">And they showed their handsome legs , and did n't care -</l>
       <l n="15">And they seemed to own the town</l>
       <l n="16">As they strode on up and down -</l>
       <l n="17">Oh , they surely were a sight for tired eyes !</l>
       <l n="18">Those braw , bonnie laddies</l>
       <l n="19">In their kilts and their plaidies ,</l>
       <l n="20">And I stared at them with pleasure and surprise .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="21">I had read about the valour of old Scotland 's warrior sons -</l>
       <l n="22">How they fought to a finish , or else fell ;</l>
       <l n="23">I had heard the name bestowed on them by agitated Huns ,</l>
       <l n="24">Who called these skirted soldiers ‘ Dames of Hell ’ ;</l>
       <l n="25">And I gave them right of way</l>
       <l n="26">On their London holiday ,</l>
       <l n="27">As I met them swinging down the street and Strand ,</l>
       <l n="28">Those bonnie , bonnie laddies</l>
       <l n="29">In their kilts and their plaidies ,</l>
       <l n="30">And I breathed a blessing on them and their land</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="31">Now the world is all rejoicing that the end of war has come -</l>
       <l n="32">And no heart is any gladder than my own ,</l>
       <l n="33">That the brutal , blatant voices of the guns at last are dumb ,</l>
       <l n="34">And the Dove of Peace from out her cage has flown .</l>
       <l n="35">Yet , when men no more march by ,</l>
       <l n="36">Making pictures for the eye ,</l>
       <l n="37">There 's a vital dash of colour earth will lack ,</l>
       <l n="38">When the brave Highland laddies</l>
       <l n="39">Drop their kilts and their plaidies ,</l>
       <l n="40">And return to common clothes of grey or black !</l>

      <head>CONVERSATION</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">We were a baker 's dozen in the house — six women and six men</l>
       <l n="2">Besides myself ; and all of us had known</l>
       <l n="3">Those benefits supposed to come from school and church and brush and</l>
       <l n="4">pen ,</l>
       <l n="5">And opportunities of being thrown</l>
       <l n="6">In contact with the cultured and the gifted people of the day .</l>
       <l n="7">Being the thirteenth one among six pairs</l>
       <l n="8">I deemed it wise to keep apart and let the others have their say :</l>
       <l n="9">And from my vantage-place upon the stairs ,</l>
       <l n="10">Or in a corner , where I seemed to read , I listened for some word</l>
       <l n="11">That would make life seem sweeter , or cast light</l>
       <l n="12">Upon the goal toward which all footsteps wend : and this was what I</l>
       <l n="13">heard</l>
       <l n="14">Throughout each day and half of every night .</l>
       <l n="15">The men talked business , politics , and trade ;</l>
       <l n="16">They told of safe investments , and great chances</l>
       <l n="17">For speculation . ( One man who had made</l>
       <l n="18">Pleasure his art , described the newest dances</l>
       <l n="19">And dwelt upon each chasse , glide , and whirl</l>
       <l n="20">As lovers dwell upon the charms of some fair girl . )</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="21">They talked of war , and tried to find its cause ,</l>
       <l n="22">And quite deplored the fact that wars must come .</l>
       <l n="23">But since this desperate condition was ,</l>
       <l n="24">They carefully computed what the sum</l>
       <l n="25">Of profit might be to a land of peace ,</l>
       <l n="26">And wondered if times would be harder should war cease .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="27">They spoke of games and sports ; told many a story</l>
       <l n="28">That made the listeners laugh ; then back from these</l>
       <l n="29">Always they harked to money , or the gory</l>
       <l n="30">And savage drama playing overseas .</l>
       <l n="31">Then there were tales from club and smoking-room -</l>
       <l n="32">The submarines of gossip , bringing some name doom .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="33">The women talked of fashions and of plays ,</l>
       <l n="34">But more of players and their private lives ;</l>
       <l n="35">Related tittle-tattle of their words and ways ,</l>
       <l n="36">Their lightning change of husbands and of wives .</l>
       <l n="37">And there was chat of garments and their price ,</l>
       <l n="38">Of operas and balls and all that gives life spice .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="39">Some talk there was of music , pictures , books ,</l>
       <l n="40">But of musicians , painters , authors , more .</l>
       <l n="41">The way they lived — their methods and their looks -</l>
       <l n="42">The colour of their eyes — the clothes they wore ;</l>
       <l n="43">And whether it was true , as had been stated ,</l>
       <l n="44">That gifted people were quite sure to be mis-mated .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="45">They talked of servants , menus , and disease ,</l>
       <l n="46">And operations . Each one came in line</l>
       <l n="47">With some astounding tale to tell of these ,</l>
       <l n="48">And of her surgeon 's skill , which seemed divine .</l>
       <l n="49">But of that vast Domain where live our dead</l>
       <l n="50">And where we all are hurrying , no word was said .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="51">When we know that goal awaits each one of us a little farther on ,</l>

       <l n="53">there ,</l>
       <l n="54">Why do we not speak of it in our daily conversation ?</l>
       <l n="55">Why do we not familiarise our minds with thoughts of worlds unseen ?</l>
       <l n="56">There are many beautiful things to be learned of that country .</l>
       <l n="57">There are sacred books of great travellers , whose souls have cried ,</l>
       <l n="58">‘ Hail across the border ’ ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="59">There are truths which have been learned in visions and by</l>
       <l n="60">revelations :</l>
       <l n="61">All the revelations were not given to St. John alone ,</l>
       <l n="62">All the wise men of the world did not die two thousand years ago !</l>
       <l n="63">Why do we not talk of these eternal truths ,</l>
       <l n="64">Instead of wasting all our words on the evanesent , the ever-</l>
       <l n="65">changing , the trivial , and the unimportant ?</l>

       <l n="27">Before I went down in the swirling oceans</l>
       <l n="28">And fought with madness and doubt and grief .</l>
       <l n="29">Now I am climbing the Hills of Knowledge ,</l>
       <l n="30">And I speak unfearing , and say ‘ I know , ’</l>
       <l n="31">Though it be not to church , or to book , or college ,</l>
       <l n="32">But to God Himself that my debt I owe .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">For the ceaseless prayer of a soul is heeded ,</l>
       <l n="34">When the prayer asks only for light and faith ;</l>
       <l n="35">And the faith and the light and the knowledge needed</l>
       <l n="36">Shall gild with glory the path to death .</l>
       <l n="37">Oh ! heart of the world by sorrow shaken ,</l>
       <l n="38">Hear ye the message I have to give :</l>
       <l n="39">The seal from the lips of the dead is taken ,</l>
       <l n="40">And they can say to you , ‘ Lo ! we live . ’</l>

      <head>THE DEADLIEST SIN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There are not many sins when once we sift them .</l>
       <l n="2">In actions of evolving human souls</l>
       <l n="3">Striving to reach high goals</l>
       <l n="4">And falling backward into dust and mire ,</l>
       <l n="5">Some element we find that seems to lift them</l>
       <l n="6">Above our condemnation — even higher</l>
       <l n="7">Into the realm of pity and compassion .</l>
       <l n="8">So beauteous a thing as love itself can fashion</l>
       <l n="9">A chain of sins ; descending to desire ,</l>
       <l n="10">It wanders into dangerous paths , and leads</l>
       <l n="11">To most unholy deeds ,</l>
       <l n="12">And light-struck , walks in madness toward the night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="13">Wrong oft-times is an over-ripened right ,</l>
       <l n="14">A rank weed grown from some neglected flower ,</l>
       <l n="15">The lightning uncontrolled : flames meant for joy</l>
       <l n="16">And beauty , used to ravage and destroy .</l>
       <l n="17">For sins like these repentance can atone .</l>
       <l n="18">There is one sin alone</l>
       <l n="19">Which seems all unforgivable , because</l>
       <l n="20">It springs from no temptation and no need</l>
       <l n="21">And no desire , save to make sweet faith bleed ,</l>
       <l n="22">And to defame God 's laws .</l>
       <l n="23">Oh ! viler than the murderer or the thief</l>
       <l n="24">Who slays the body and who robs the purse ,</l>
       <l n="25">Is he who strives to kill the mind 's belief</l>
       <l n="26">And rob it of its hope</l>
       <l n="27">Of life beyond this little pain-filled span .</l>
       <l n="28">God has no curse</l>
       <l n="29">Quite dark enough to punish such a man ,</l>
       <l n="30">Who , seeing how souls grope</l>
       <l n="31">And suffer in this world of mighty losses ,</l>
       <l n="32">And how hearts stagger on beneath life 's crosses ,</l>
       <l n="33">Yet strives to rob them of their staff of faith</l>
       <l n="34">And make them think dark death</l>
       <l n="35">Ends all existence ; think the worshipped child</l>
       <l n="36">Cold in its mother 's arms is but a clod</l>
       <l n="37">And has not gone to God ;</l>
       <l n="38">That souls united by love undefiled</l>
       <l n="39">And holy can by death be torn asunder</l>
       <l n="40">To meet no more .</l>
       <l n="41">It must be true that under</l>
       <l n="42">This earth of ours there lies a Purgatory</l>
       <l n="43">For those who seek to rob grief of the glory</l>
       <l n="44">That shines through hope of life immortal . In</l>
       <l n="45">Sin 's lexicon this is the vilest sin -</l>
       <l n="46">Needless and cruel , ugly , gaunt and mean ,</l>
       <l n="47">Without one poor excuse on which to lean ,</l>
       <l n="48">A vandal sin , that with no hope of gain</l>
       <l n="49">Finds pleasure only in another 's pain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="50">God ! though all other sins on earth persist ,</l>
       <l n="51">Strike dumb the blatant , loud-mouthed atheist .</l>
