     <l n="1">A little bit of a woman came</l>
     <l n="2">Athwart my path one day ;</l>
     <l n="3">So tiny was she that she seemed to be</l>
     <l n="4">A pixy strayed from the misty sea ,</l>
     <l n="5">Or a wandering greenwood fay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">“ Oho , you little elf ! ” I cried ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ And what are you doing here ?</l>
     <l n="8">So tiny as you will never do</l>
     <l n="9">For the brutal rush and hullaballoo</l>
     <l n="10">Of this practical world , I fear . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">“ Voice have I , good sir , ” said she .—</l>
     <l n="12">“ ‘ Tis soft as an Angel 's sigh ,</l>
     <l n="13">But to fancy a word of yours were heard</l>
     <l n="14">In all the din of this world 's absurd ! ”</l>
     <l n="15">Smiling , I made reply .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">“ Hands have I , good sir ” she quoth .—</l>
     <l n="17">“ Marry , and that have you !</l>
     <l n="18">But amid the strife and the tumult rife</l>
     <l n="19">In all the struggle and battle for life ,</l>
     <l n="20">What can those wee hands do ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">“ Eyes have I , good sir , ” she said .—</l>
     <l n="22">“ Sooth , you have , ” quoth I ,</l>
     <l n="23">“ And tears shall flow therefrom , I trow ,</l>
     <l n="24">And they betimes shall dim with woe ,</l>
     <l n="25">As the hard , hard years go by ! ”</l>

     <l n="26">That little bit of a woman cast</l>
     <l n="27">Her two eyes full on me ,</l>

     <l n="31">That little bit of a woman 's hands</l>

     <l n="34">And they buffet it still with such sweet art</l>

     <l n="36">That little bit of a woman 's voice</l>

    <head>FATHER 'S WAY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">MY father was no pessimist ; he loved the things of earth ,—</l>
     <l n="2">Its cheerfulness and sunshine , its music and its mirth .</l>
     <l n="3">He never sighed or moped around whenever things went wrong ,—</l>
     <l n="4">I warrant me he 'd mocked at fate with some defiant song ;</l>
     <l n="5">But , being he war n't much on tune , when times looked sort o ’ blue ,</l>
     <l n="6">He 'd whistle softly to himself this only tune he knew ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">[ Illustration : Music ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Now mother , when she heard that tune which father whistled so ,</l>
     <l n="9">Would say , “ There 's something wrong to-day with Ephraim , I know ;</l>
     <l n="10">He never tries to make believe he 's happy that ‘ ere way</l>
     <l n="11">But that I 'm certain as can be there 's somethin ’ wrong to pay . ”</l>
     <l n="12">And so betimes , quite natural-like , to us observant youth</l>
     <l n="13">There seemed suggestion in that tune of deep , pathetic truth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">When Brother William joined the war , a lot of us went down</l>
     <l n="15">To see the gallant soldier boys right gayly out of town .</l>
     <l n="16">A-comin ’ home , poor mother cried as if her heart would break ,</l>
     <l n="17">And all us children , too ,— for hers , and not for William 's sake !</l>
     <l n="18">But father , trudgin ’ on ahead , his hands behind him so ,</l>
     <l n="19">Kept whistlin ’ to himself , so sort of solemn-like and low .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">And when my oldest sister , Sue , was married and went West ,</l>
     <l n="21">Seemed like it took the tuck right out of mother and the rest .</l>
     <l n="22">She was the sunlight in our home ,— why , father used to say</l>
     <l n="23">It would n't seem like home at all if Sue should go away ;</l>
     <l n="24">But when she went , a-leavin ’ us all sorrer and all tears ,</l>
     <l n="25">Poor father whistled lonesome-like — and went to feed the steers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">When crops were bad , and other ills befell our homely lot ,</l>
     <l n="27">He 'd set of nights and try to act as if he minded not ;</l>
     <l n="28">And when came death and bore away the one he worshipped so ,</l>
     <l n="29">How vainly did his lips belie the heart benumbed with woe !</l>
     <l n="30">You see the telltale whistle told a mood he 'd not admit ,—</l>
     <l n="31">He 'd always stopped his whistlin ’ when he thought we noticed it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="32">I 'd like to see that stooping form and hoary head again ,—</l>
     <l n="33">To see the honest , hearty smile that cheered his fellow-men .</l>
     <l n="34">Oh , could I kiss the kindly lips that spake no creature wrong ,</l>
     <l n="35">And share the rapture of the heart that overflowed with song !</l>
     <l n="36">Oh , could I hear the little tune he whistled long ago ,</l>
     <l n="37">When he did battle with the griefs he would not have us know !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>

    <head>JOHN SMITH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">TO-DAY I strayed in Charing Cross , as wretched as could be ,</l>
     <l n="2">With thinking of my home and friends across the tumbling sea ;</l>
     <l n="3">There was no water in my eyes , but my spirits were depressed ,</l>
     <l n="4">And my heart lay like a sodden , soggy doughnut in my breast .</l>
     <l n="5">This way and that streamed multitudes , that gayly passed me by ;</l>
     <l n="6">Not one in all the crowd knew me , and not a one knew I .</l>
     <l n="7">“ Oh for a touch of home ! ” I sighed ; “ oh for a friendly face !</l>
     <l n="8">Oh for a hearty hand-clasp in this teeming , desert place ! ”</l>
     <l n="9">And so soliloquizing , as a homesick creature will ,</l>
     <l n="10">Incontinent , I wandered down the noisy , bustling hill ,</l>
     <l n="11">And drifted , automatic-like and vaguely , into Lowe 's ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where Fortune had in store a panacea for my woes .</l>
     <l n="13">The register was open , and there dawned upon my sight</l>
     <l n="14">A name that filled and thrilled me with a cyclone of delight ,—</l>
     <l n="15">The name that I shall venerate unto my dying day ,—</l>

     <l n="17">Wildly I clutched the register , and brooded on that name ;</l>
     <l n="18">I knew John Smith , yet could not well identify the same .</l>
     <l n="19">I knew him North , I knew him South , I knew him East and West ;</l>

     <l n="21">His eyes , I recollect , were gray , and black , and brown , and blue ;</l>
     <l n="22">And when he was not bald , his hair was of chameleon hue ;</l>
     <l n="23">Lean , fat , tall , short , rich , poor , grave , gay , a blonde , and a</l>
     <l n="24">brunette ,—</l>

    <head>THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD .</head>

     <l n="1">ONCE on a time a friend of mine prevailed on me to go</l>

     <l n="10">A certain inspiration which I cannot well define !</l>
     <l n="11">How it bubbles , how it sparkles , how its gurgling seems to say :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">DEAR Palmer , just a year ago we did the Carlsbad cure ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which , though it be exceeding slow , is as exceeding sure ;</l>
     <l n="3">To corpulency you were prone , dyspepsia bothered me ,—</l>
     <l n="4">You tipped the beam at twenty stone and I at ten stone three !</l>
     <l n="5">The cure , they told us , works both ways : it makes the fat man lean ;</l>
     <l n="6">The thin man , after many days , achieves a portly mien ;</l>
     <l n="7">And though it 's true you still are fat , while I am like a crow ,—</l>
     <l n="8">All skin and feathers ,— what of that ? The cure takes time , you know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The Carlsbad scenery is sublime ,— that 's what the guide-books say ;</l>
     <l n="10">We did not think so at that time , nor think I so to-day !</l>
     <l n="11">The bluffs that squeeze the panting town permit no pleasing views ,</l>
     <l n="12">But weigh the mortal spirits down and give a chap the blues .</l>
     <l n="13">With nothing to amuse us then or mitigate our spleen ,</l>
     <l n="14">We rose and went to bed again , with three bad meals between ;</l>
     <l n="15">And constantly we made our moan ,— ah , none so drear as we ,</l>
     <l n="16">When you were weighing twenty stone and I but ten stone three !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">We never scaled the mountain-side , for walking was my bane ,</l>
     <l n="18">And you were much too big to ride the mules that there obtain ;</l>
     <l n="19">And so we loitered in the shade with Israel out in force ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or through the Pupp'sche allee strayed and heard the band discourse .</l>
     <l n="21">Sometimes it pleased us to recline upon the Tepl 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="22">Or watch the bilious human line file round to get a drink ;</l>
     <l n="23">Anon the portier 's piping tone embittered you and me ,</l>
     <l n="24">When you were weighing twenty stone and I but ten stone three !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">And oh ! those awful things to eat ! No pudding , cake , or pie ,</l>
     <l n="26">But just a little dab of meat , and crusts absurdly dry ;</l>
     <l n="27">Then , too , that water twice a day ,— one swallow was enough</l>
     <l n="28">To take one 's appetite away ,— the tepid , awful stuff !</l>
     <l n="29">Tortured by hunger 's cruel stings , I 'd little else to do</l>
     <l n="30">Than feast my eyes upon the things prescribed and cooked for you .</l>
     <l n="31">The goodies went to you alone , the husks all fell to me ,</l>
     <l n="32">When you were weighing twenty stone and I weighed ten stone three .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Yet happy days ! and rapturous ills ! and sweetly dismal date !</l>
     <l n="34">When , sandwiched in between those hills , we twain bemoaned our fate .</l>
     <l n="35">The little woes we suffered then like mists have sped away ,</l>
     <l n="36">And I were glad to share again those ills with you to-day ,—</l>
     <l n="37">To flounder in those rains of June that flood that Austrian vale ,</l>
     <l n="38">To quaff that tepid Kaiserbrunn and starve on victuals stale !</l>
     <l n="39">And often , leagues and leagues away from where we suffered then ,</l>
     <l n="40">With envious yearnings I survey what cannot be again !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">And often in my quiet home , through dim and misty eyes ,</l>
     <l n="42">I seem to see that curhaus dome blink at the radiant skies ;</l>
     <l n="43">I seem to hear that Wiener band above the Tepl 's roar ,—</l>
     <l n="44">To feel the pressure of your hand and hear your voice once more ;</l>
     <l n="45">And , better yet , my heart is warm with thoughts of you and yours ,</l>
     <l n="46">For friendship hath a sweeter charm than thrice ten thousand cures !</l>
     <l n="47">So I am happy to have known that time across the sea</l>
     <l n="48">When you were weighing twenty stone and I weighed ten stone three .</l>

     <l n="1">IT 'S everywhere that women fair invite and please my eye ,</l>
     <l n="2">And that on dress I lay much stress I can n't and sha'n ' t deny :</l>
     <l n="3">The English dame who 's all aflame with divers colors bright ,</l>

     <l n="5">And yet I 'll say , go where I may , I never yet have seen</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Now , you must know ‘ twas years ago this quaint but noble gown</l>
     <l n="8">Flashed in one day , the usual way , upon our solemn town .</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Twas Fisk who sold for sordid gold that gravely scrumptious thing ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Jim Fisk , the man who drove a span that would have joyed a king ,—</l>
     <l n="11">And grandma 's eye fell with a sigh upon that sombre sheen ,</l>
     <l n="12">And grandpa 's purse looked much the worse for grandma 's bombazine .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Though ten years old , I never told the neighbors of the gown ;</l>
     <l n="14">For grandma said , “ This secret , Ned , must not be breathed in town . ”</l>
     <l n="15">The sitting-room for days of gloom was in a dreadful mess</l>
     <l n="16">When that quaint dame , Miss Kelsey , came to make the wondrous dress :</l>
     <l n="17">To fit and baste and stitch a waist , with whale-bones in between ,</l>
     <l n="18">Is precious slow , as all folks know who 've made a bombazine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">

     <l n="22">Within the press she hid that dress , secure from prying eyes ;</l>

     <l n="25">I need not state she got there late ; and , sailing up the aisle</l>

     <l n="28">That there was not one faulty spot a critic could have found .</l>
     <l n="29">How proud I was of her , because she looked so like a queen !</l>

     <l n="33">For ugly-grained old cats obtained in that New England town :</l>
     <l n="34">The Widow White spat out her spite in one : “ It does n't fit ! ”</l>
     <l n="35">The Packard girls ( they wore false curls ) all giggled like to split ;</l>
     <l n="36">Sophronia Wade , the sour old maid , she turned a bilious green ,</l>

     <l n="38">But grandma knew , and I did , too , that gown was wondrous fine ,—</l>
     <l n="39">The envious sneers and jaundiced jeers were a conclusive sign .</l>
     <l n="40">Why , grandpa said it went ahead of all the girls in town ,</l>
     <l n="41">And , saying this , he snatched a kiss that like to burst that gown ;</l>
     <l n="42">But , blushing red , my grandma said , “ Oh , is n't grandpa mean ! ”</l>
     <l n="43">Yet evermore my grandma wore his favorite bombazine .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="44">And when she died that sombre pride passed down to heedless heirs ,—</l>
     <l n="45">Alas , the day ‘ t was hung away beneath the kitchen stairs !</l>
     <l n="46">Thence in due time , with dust and grime , came foes on foot and wing ,</l>
     <l n="47">And made their nests and sped their guests in that once beauteous</l>
     <l n="48">thing .</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Tis so , forsooth ! Time 's envious tooth corrodes each human scene ;</l>
     <l n="50">And so , at last , to ruin passed my grandma 's bombazine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="51">Yet to this day , I 'm proud to say , it plays a grateful part ,—</l>
     <l n="52">The thoughts it brings are of such things as touch and warm my heart .</l>
     <l n="53">This gown , my dear , you show me here I 'll own is passing fair ,</l>
     <l n="54">Though I 'll confess it 's no such dress as grandma used to wear .</l>
     <l n="55">Yet wear it , do ; perchance when you and I are off the scene ,</l>
     <l n="56">Our boy shall sing this comely thing as I the bombazine .</l>

     <l n="1">COME , Harvey , let us sit awhile and talk about the times</l>
     <l n="2">Before you went to selling clothes and I to peddling rhymes ,—</l>
     <l n="3">The days when we were little boys , as naughty little boys</l>
     <l n="4">As ever worried home folks with their everlasting noise !</l>
     <l n="5">Egad ! and were we so disposed , I 'll venture we could show</l>
     <l n="6">The scars of wallopings we got some forty years ago ;</l>
     <l n="7">What wallopings I mean I think I need not specify ,—</l>
     <l n="8">Mother 's whippings did n't hurt ; but father 's ,— oh , my !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The way that we played hookey those many years ago ,</l>
     <l n="10">We 'd rather give ‘ most anything than have our children know !</l>
     <l n="11">The thousand naughty things we did , the thousand fibs we told ,—</l>
     <l n="12">Why , thinking of them makes my Presbyterian blood run cold !</l>
     <l n="13">How often Deacon Sabine Morse remarked if we were his</l>
     <l n="14">He 'd tan our “ pesky little hides until the blisters riz ” !</l>
     <l n="15">It 's many a hearty thrashing to that Deacon Morse we owe ,—</l>
     <l n="16">Mother 's whippings did n't count ; father 's did , though !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">We used to sneak off swimmin ’ in those careless , boyish days ,</l>
     <l n="18">And come back home of evenings with our necks and backs ablaze ;</l>
     <l n="19">How mother used to wonder why our clothes were full of sand ,—</l>
     <l n="20">But father , having been a boy , appeared to understand ;</l>
     <l n="21">And after tea he 'd beckon us to join him in the shed ,</l>
     <l n="22">Where he 'd proceed to tinge our backs a deeper , darker red .</l>
     <l n="23">Say what we will of mother 's , there is none will controvert</l>
     <l n="24">The proposition that our father 's lickings always hurt !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">For mother was by nature so forgiving and so mild</l>
     <l n="26">That she inclined to spare the rod although she spoiled the child ;</l>
     <l n="27">And when at last in self-defence she had to whip us , she</l>
     <l n="28">Appeared to feel those whippings a great deal more than we :</l>
     <l n="29">But how we bellowed and took on , as if we 'd like to die ,—</l>
     <l n="30">Poor mother really thought she hurt , and that 's what made her cry !</l>
     <l n="31">Then how we youngsters snickered as out the door we slid ,</l>
     <l n="32">For mother 's whippings never hurt , though father 's always did !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">In after years poor father simmered down to five feet four ,</l>
     <l n="34">But in our youth he seemed to us in height eight feet or more !</l>
     <l n="35">Oh , how we shivered when he quoth in cold , suggestive tone :</l>
     <l n="36">“ I 'll see you in the woodshed after supper all alone ! ”</l>
     <l n="37">Oh , how the legs and arms and dust and trouser-buttons flew ,—</l>

     <l n="39">Yes , after all this lapse of years , I feelingly assert ,</l>

     <l n="45">The years , the gracious years , have smoothed and beautified the ways</l>

    <head>PROVIDENCE AND THE DOG .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHEN I was young and callow , which was many years ago ,</l>
     <l n="2">Within me the afflatus went surging to and fro ;</l>
     <l n="3">And so I wrote a tragedy that fairly reeked with gore ,</l>
     <l n="4">With every act concluding with the dead piled on the floor ,—</l>
     <l n="5">A mighty effort , by the gods ! and after I had read</l>
     <l n="6">The manuscript to Daly , that dramatic censor said :</l>
     <l n="7">“ The plot is most exciting , and I like the dialogue ;</l>
     <l n="8">You should take the thing to Providence , and try it on a dog . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">McCambridge organized a troupe , including many a name</l>
     <l n="10">Unknown alike to guileless me , to riches , and to fame .</l>
     <l n="11">A pompous man whose name was Rae was Nestor of this troupe ,—</l>
     <l n="12">Amphibious , he was quite at home outside or in the soup !</l>
     <l n="13">The way McCambridge billed him ! Why , such dreams in red and green</l>
     <l n="14">Had ne'er before upon the boards of Yankeedom been seen ;</l>
     <l n="15">And my proud name was heralded ,— oh that I 'd gone incog .</l>

     <l n="20">The factory people seldom bought their seats so far ahead ,</l>
     <l n="21">And Rae indorsed McCambridge . So they partly set at rest</l>
     <l n="22">The natural misgivings that perturbed my youthful breast ;</l>
     <l n="23">For I wondered and lamented that the town was not agog</l>

     <l n="32">When desolation settled down on me like some dense fog</l>
     <l n="33">For having tempted Providence , and tried it on a dog !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="34">Those actors did n't know their parts ; they maundered to and fro ,</l>

     <l n="36">And when I sought to reprimand the graceless scamps , the lot</l>
     <l n="37">Turned fiercely on me , and denounced my charming play as rot .</l>
     <l n="38">I might have stood their bitter taunts without a passing grunt ,</l>
     <l n="39">If I 'd had a word of solace from the people out in front ;</l>
     <l n="40">But that chilly corporal 's guard sat round like bumps upon a log</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="42">We went with lots of baggage , but we did n't bring it back ,—</l>

     <l n="44">“ Oh , ruthless muse of tragedy ! what prodigies of shame ,</l>
     <l n="45">What marvels of injustice are committed in thy name ! ”</l>
     <l n="46">Thus groaned I in the spirit , as I strode what stretch of ties</l>
     <l n="47">‘ Twixt Providence , Rhode Island , and my native Gotham lies ;</l>
     <l n="48">But Rae , McCambridge , and the rest kept up a steady jog ,—</l>

     <l n="50">So much for my first battle with the fickle goddess , Fame ,—</l>

     <l n="52">Oh , hapless he that on the graceless Yankee dog relies !</l>
     <l n="53">The dog fares stout and hearty , and the play it is that dies .</l>
     <l n="54">So ye with tragedies to try , I beg of you , beware !</l>

    <head>THE DOINGS OF DELSARTE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IN former times my numerous rhymes excited general mirth ,</l>
     <l n="2">And I was then of all good men the merriest man on earth ;</l>
     <l n="3">And my career</l>
     <l n="4">From year to year</l>
     <l n="5">Was full of cheer</l>
     <l n="6">And things ,</l>
     <l n="7">Despite a few regrets , perdieu ! which grim dyspepsia brings ;</l>
     <l n="8">But now how strange and harsh a change has come upon the scene !</l>
     <l n="9">Horrors appall the life where all was formerly so serene :</l>
     <l n="10">Yes , wasting care hath cast its snare about my honest heart ,</l>
     <l n="11">Because , alas ! it hath come to pass my daughter 's learned Delsarte .</l>
     <l n="12">In flesh and joint and every point the counterpart of me ,</l>
     <l n="13">She grew so fast she grew at last a marvellous thing to see ,—</l>
     <l n="14">Long , gaunt , and slim , each gangling limb played stumbling-block to</l>
     <l n="15">t'other ,</l>
     <l n="16">The which excess of awkwardness quite mortified her mother .</l>
     <l n="17">Now , as for me , I like to see the carriages uncouth</l>
     <l n="18">Which certify to all the shy , unconscious age of youth .</l>
     <l n="19">If maidenkind be pure of mind , industrious , tidy , smart ,</l>
     <l n="20">What need that they should fool away their youth upon Delsarte ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="21">In good old times my numerous rhymes occasioned general mirth ,</l>
     <l n="22">But now you see</l>
     <l n="23">Revealed in me</l>
     <l n="24">The gloomiest bard on earth .</l>
     <l n="25">I sing no more of the joys of yore that marked my happy life ,</l>
     <l n="26">But rather those depressing woes with which the present 's rife .</l>
     <l n="27">Unreconciled to that gaunt child , who 's now a fashion-plate ,</l>
     <l n="28">One song I raise in Art 's dispraise , and so do I fight with Fate :</l>
     <l n="29">This gangling bard has found it hard to see his counterpart</l>
     <l n="30">Long , loose , and slim , divorced from him by that hectic dude ,</l>
     <l n="31">Delsarte .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="32">Where'er she goes ,</l>
     <l n="33">She loves to pose ,</l>
     <l n="34">In classic attitudes ,</l>
     <l n="35">And droop her eyes in languid wise , and feign abstracted moods ;</l>
     <l n="36">And she , my child ,</l>
     <l n="37">Who all so wild ,</l>
     <l n="38">So helpless and so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="39">That once she knew not what to do with those great big hands and feet ,</l>
     <l n="40">Now comes and goes with such repose , so calmly sits or stands ,</l>
     <l n="41">Is so discreet with both her feet , so deft with both her hands .</l>
     <l n="42">Why , when I see that satire on me , I give an angry start ,</l>
     <l n="43">And I utter one word — it is commonly heard — derogatory to Delsarte .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="44">In years gone by ‘ t was said that I was quite a scrumptious man ;</l>
     <l n="45">Conceit galore had I before this Delsarte craze began ;</l>
     <l n="46">But now these wise</l>
     <l n="47">Folks criticise</l>
     <l n="48">My figure and my face ,</l>
     <l n="49">And I opine they even incline to sneer at my musical bass .</l>
     <l n="50">Why , sometimes they presume to say this wart upon my cheek</l>
     <l n="51">Is not refined , and remarks unkind they pass on that antique ,—</l>
     <l n="52">With lusty bass and charms of face and figure will I part</l>
     <l n="53">Ere they extort this grand old wart to placat their Delsarte .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="54">Oh , wretched day ! as all shall say who 've known my Muse before ,</l>
     <l n="55">When by this rhyme you see that I 'm not in it any more .</l>
     <l n="56">Good-by the mirth that over earth diffused such keen delight ;</l>
     <l n="57">The old-time bard</l>
     <l n="58">Of pork and lard</l>
     <l n="59">Is plainly out of sight .</l>
     <l n="60">All withered now about his brow the laurel fillets droop ,</l>
     <l n="61">While Lachesis brews</l>
     <l n="62">For the poor old Muse</l>
     <l n="63">A portion of scalding soup .</l>
     <l n="64">Engrave this line , O friends of mine ! over my broken heart :</l>

     <l n="1">Buttercup , Poppy , Forget-me-not ,—</l>
     <l n="2">These three bloomed in a garden spot ;</l>
     <l n="3">And once , all merry with song and play ,</l>
     <l n="4">A little one heard three voices say :</l>

     <l n="6">O thou child with the tangled hair</l>

     <l n="14">Poppy came , bringing the sweetest dreams ,</l>

     <l n="16">Till once the sleeper would not awake ;</l>
     <l n="17">Kissing the little face under the pall ,</l>
     <l n="18">We thought of the words the third flower spake ,</l>
