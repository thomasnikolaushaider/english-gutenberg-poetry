     <p>The final word in the title of this volume refers to the DIVINE POWER in every human being , the recognition of which is the secret to all success and happiness . It is this idea which many of the verses endeavour to illustrate .</p>

      <head>THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A curious vision on mine eyes unfurled</l>
       <l n="2">In the deep night . I saw , or seemed to see ,</l>
       <l n="3">Two Centuries meet , and sit down vis-a-vis</l>
       <l n="4">Across the great round table of the world :</l>
       <l n="5">One with suggested sorrows in his mien ,</l>
       <l n="6">And on his brow the furrowed lines of thought ;</l>
       <l n="7">And one whose glad expectant presence brought</l>
       <l n="8">A glow and radiance from the realms unseen .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Hand clasped with hand , in silence for a space</l>
       <l n="10">The Centuries sat ; the sad old eyes of one</l>
       <l n="11">( As grave paternal eyes regard a son )</l>
       <l n="12">Gazing upon that other eager face .</l>
       <l n="13">And then a voice , as cadenceless and gray</l>
       <l n="14">As the sea 's monody in winter time ,</l>
       <l n="15">Mingled with tones melodious , as the chime</l>
       <l n="16">Of bird choirs , singing in the dawns of May .</l>

     <lg type="poem">
      <head>THE OLD CENTURY SPEAKS</head>
       <l n="1">By you , Hope stands . With me , Experience walks .</l>
       <l n="2">Like a fair jewel in a faded box ,</l>
       <l n="3">In my tear-rusted heart , sweet Pity lies .</l>
       <l n="4">For all the dreams that look forth from your eyes ,</l>
       <l n="5">And those bright-hued ambitions , which I know</l>
       <l n="6">Must fall like leaves and perish , in Time 's snow ,</l>
       <l n="7">( Even as my soul 's garden stands bereft ,)</l>
       <l n="8">I give you pity ! ‘ tis the one gift left .</l>

      <head>THE NEW CENTURY</head>
       <l n="1">Nay , nay , good friend ! not pity , but Godspeed ,</l>
       <l n="2">Here in the morning of my life I need .</l>
       <l n="3">Counsel , and not condolence ; smiles , not tears ,</l>
       <l n="4">To guide me through the channels of the years .</l>
       <l n="5">Oh , I am blinded by the blaze of light</l>
       <l n="6">That shines upon me from the Infinite .</l>
       <l n="7">Blurred is my vision by the close approach</l>
       <l n="8">To unseen shores , whereon the times encroach .</l>

      <head>THE OLD CENTURY</head>
       <l n="1">Illusion , all illusion . List and hear</l>
       <l n="2">The Godless cannons , booming far and near .</l>
       <l n="3">Flaunting the flag of Unbelief , with Greed</l>
       <l n="4">For pilot , lo ! the pirate age in speed</l>
       <l n="5">Bears on to ruin . War 's most hideous crimes</l>
       <l n="6">Besmirch the record of these modern times .</l>
       <l n="7">Degenerate is the world I leave to you , -</l>
       <l n="8">My happiest speech to earth will be — adieu .</l>

      <head>THE NEW CENTURY</head>
       <l n="1">You speak as one too weary to be just .</l>
       <l n="2">I hear the guns — I see the greed and lust .</l>
       <l n="3">The death throes of a giant evil fill</l>
       <l n="4">The air with riot and confusion . Ill</l>
       <l n="5">Ofttimes makes fallow ground for Good ; and Wrong</l>
       <l n="6">Builds Right 's foundation , when it grows too strong .</l>
       <l n="7">Pregnant with promise is the hour , and grand</l>
       <l n="8">The trust you leave in my all-willing hand .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>THE OLD CENTURY</head>
       <l n="1">As one who throws a flickering taper 's ray</l>
       <l n="2">To light departing feet , my shadowed way</l>
       <l n="3">You brighten with your faith . Faith makes the man</l>
       <l n="4">Alas , that my poor foolish age outran</l>
       <l n="5">Its early trust in God ! The death of art</l>
       <l n="6">And progress follows , when the world 's hard heart</l>
       <l n="7">Casts out religion . ‘ Tis the human brain</l>
       <l n="8">Men worship now , and heaven , to them , means — gain .</l>

       <l n="14">On the deck our noble Pilot , in the glory of his prime ,</l>

     <p>In the annals of the ages , he who had no thought of fame ( Keeping on the path of duty , caring not for praise or blame ) , Close beside the deathless Lincoln , writ in light , will shine his name .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Youth proclaimed him as a hero ; time , a statesman ; love , a man ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">He was chosen by the people ; not an accident of birth</l>

       <l n="7">While opulent and dainty in her tastes .</l>
       <l n="8">A nature generous and free , albeit</l>
       <l n="9">The incarnation of economy .</l>
       <l n="10">She must be chaste as proud Diana was ,</l>
       <l n="11">Yet warm as Venus . To all others cold</l>
       <l n="12">As some white glacier glittering in the sun ;</l>
       <l n="13">To me as ardent as the sensuous rose</l>
       <l n="14">That yields its sweetness to the burrowing bee</l>
       <l n="15">All ignorant of evil in the world ,</l>
       <l n="16">And innocent as any cloistered nun ,</l>
       <l n="17">Yet wise as Phryne in the arts of love</l>
       <l n="18">When I come thirsting to her nectared lips .</l>
       <l n="19">Good as the best , and tempting as the worst ,</l>
       <l n="20">A saint , a siren , and a paradox .</l>

      <head>PREPARATION</head>
       <l n="1">We must not force events , but rather make</l>
       <l n="2">The heart soil ready for their coming , as</l>
       <l n="3">The earth spreads carpets for the feet of Spring ,</l>
       <l n="4">Or , with the strengthening tonic of the frost ,</l>
       <l n="5">Prepares for winter . Should a July noon</l>
       <l n="6">Burst suddenly upon a frozen world</l>
       <l n="7">Small joy would follow , even though that world</l>
       <l n="8">Were longing for the Summer . Should the sting</l>
       <l n="9">Of sharp December pierce the heart of June ,</l>
       <l n="10">What death and devastation would ensue !</l>
       <l n="11">All things are planned . The most majestic sphere</l>
       <l n="12">That whirls through space is governed and controlled</l>
       <l n="13">By supreme law , as is the blade of grass</l>
       <l n="14">Which through the bursting bosom of the earth</l>
       <l n="15">Creeps up to kiss the light . Poor , puny man</l>
       <l n="16">Alone doth strive and battle with the Force</l>
       <l n="17">Which rules all lives and worlds , and he alone</l>
       <l n="18">Demands effect before producing cause .</l>
       <l n="19">How vain the hope ! We cannot harvest joy</l>
       <l n="20">Until we sow the seed , and God alone</l>
       <l n="21">Knows when that seed has ripened . Oft we stand</l>
       <l n="22">And watch the ground with anxious , brooding eyes ,</l>
       <l n="23">Complaining of the slow , unfruitful yield ,</l>
       <l n="24">Not knowing that the shadow of ourselves</l>
       <l n="25">Keeps off the sunlight and delays result .</l>
       <l n="26">Sometimes our fierce impatience of desire</l>
       <l n="27">Doth like a sultry May force tender shoots</l>
       <l n="28">Of half-formed pleasures and unshaped events</l>
       <l n="29">To ripen prematurely , and we reap</l>
       <l n="30">But disappointment ; or we rot the germs</l>
       <l n="31">With briny tears ere they have time to grow .</l>
       <l n="32">While stars are born and mighty planets die</l>
       <l n="33">And hissing comets scorch the brow of space ,</l>
       <l n="34">The Universe keeps its eternal calm .</l>
       <l n="35">Through patient preparation , year on year ,</l>
       <l n="36">The earth endures the travail of the Spring</l>
       <l n="37">And Winter 's desolation . So our souls</l>
       <l n="38">In grand submission to a higher law</l>
       <l n="39">Should move serene through all the ills of life</l>
       <l n="40">Believing them masked joys .</l>

      <head>A WOMAN 'S ANSWER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">You call me an angel of love and of light ,</l>
       <l n="2">A being of goodness and heavenly fire ,</l>
       <l n="3">Sent out from God 's kingdom to guide you aright ,</l>
       <l n="4">In paths where your spirit may mount and aspire ,</l>
       <l n="5">You say that I glow like a star on its course ,</l>
       <l n="6">Like a ray from the altar , a spark from the source .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Now list to my answer — let all the world hear it ,</l>
       <l n="8">I speak unafraid what I know to be true -</l>
       <l n="9">A pure , faithful love is the creative spirit</l>
       <l n="10">Which make women angels ! I live but in you .</l>
       <l n="11">We are bound soul to soul by life 's holiest laws ;</l>
       <l n="12">If I am an angel — why , you are the cause .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">As my ship skims the sea , I look up from the deck .</l>
       <l n="14">Fair , firm at the wheel shines Love 's beautiful form .</l>
       <l n="15">And shall I curse the bark that last night went to wreck</l>
       <l n="16">By the pilot abandoned to darkness and storm ?</l>
       <l n="17">My craft is no stauncher , she too had been lost</l>
       <l n="18">Had the wheelman deserted , or slept at his post .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">I laid down the wealth of my soul at your feet</l>
       <l n="20">( Some woman does this for some man every day ) .</l>
       <l n="21">No desperate creature who walks in the street</l>
       <l n="22">Has a wickeder heart than I might have , I say ,</l>
       <l n="23">Had you wantonly misused the treasures you won -</l>

       <l n="28">Had you tortured my heart , or been base or untrue .</l>
       <l n="29">For angels and devils are cast in one mould ,</l>
       <l n="30">Till love guides them upward or downward , I hold .</l>

       <l n="33">Are the women who might have abandoned their lives</l>
       <l n="34">To the madness that springs from and ends in despair .</l>
       <l n="35">As the fire on the hearth which sheds brightness around ,</l>
       <l n="36">Neglected , may level the walls to the ground .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">The world makes grave errors in judging these things .</l>
       <l n="38">Great good and great evil are born in one breast :</l>
       <l n="39">Love horns us and hoofs us , or gives us our wings ,</l>
       <l n="40">And the best could be worst , as the worst could be best .</l>
       <l n="41">You must thank your own worth for what I grew to be ,</l>
       <l n="42">For the demon lurked under the angel in me .</l>
