    <head>LOVE LETTERS OF A VIOLINIST</head>
     <l n="1">By ERIC MACKAY</l>
   </lg>
   <p>LONDON : LAMLEY &amp; CO ., EXHIBITION ROAD , S. W .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ LOVE LETTERS OF A VIOLINIST . ’ — Letters to make the ordinary writer envious , and to awaken in lovers thanks to the poetical pen that has given forth utterances so suited to their good health or malady . Here a verse to cheer the almost hopeless ; a stanza to teach the refraining a lesson in charge and capture ; lines to fall in love with the memory , to charm the darkness , and be another light to rule the day . London was yawning behind her giant hand . The moment was propitious , and any strain of beauty was sure of an audience . At this felicitous moment a pipe of splendour sounded . London ceased to yawn . A violinist was communicating the passions of his heart to those who would listen , and amid great interest he went from house to house a-singing .... Eric Mackay is one of those wise men who have no immature volumes to haunt them . He first asked right of way on the road to Parnassus with a bundle of melodies which have never lost their appeal . While youth seeks the pink cheek , these Love Letters will command the homage of lovers . Your Petrarchs are not as common as sparrows .... These outpourings from a burning heart will always compel the student of our literature to weigh them , sift them , and establish them in some very honourable position . The charm of this early book is its freedom from drag . It moves on always . The reader is hastened along ; he has wonderful and unexpected views , which ravish him as the abrupt magnificences of the Pyrenees ravished Gautier . Perhaps you expect a tree , but you see a stream . Now , at last , it must be a great green hill , and behold ! you peep down into an echoless mossy depth of glen . At the next break in the quick , up towers a height of fancy and simile ! Thus the everlasting surprise goes on enchanting . From wild to wild , from passion to passion , from cavern to star , are we borne , and as we travel there is music about us — music of the true tone , ringing with all the natural pathos of lyrical carelessness . There have been instances in literature of the music mastering the thought , but in the case under notice the proportions are justly ministered to . There is thought and witchery of measure . The ice of craftsmanship is mingled with the wine of passion . ” — NORMAN GALE , in The Literary World , March 10th , 1893 .</p>
   <p>“ We are indebted to Eric Mackay for the latest ode to the lark , one of peculiar gracefulness and impassioned beauty . In my opinion , this is a better production than either of Wordsworth 's , superior to Hogg 's , and , though not so intellectual as Shelley 's , rivals it in truth . Mackay 's is the lark itself , Shelley 's is himself listening , with unwearied ears and tightly-stretched imagination , to the lark . Who is surprised that Eric Mackay 's lyric , ‘ The Waking of the Lark , ’ sent a thrill through the heart of America ? This poem , which appeared in the New York Independent , is undoubtedly the lark-poem of the future . From the opening to the closing stanza there is not an imperfect verse , not a commonplace . The sentiment is pure , and the fancy glowing . It is , indeed , an exquisite ode . ” — Wintringham 's “ Birds of Wordsworth . ” Edition , 1892 .</p>
   <p>“ He ( the lecturer ) ventured to call the author of the ‘ Love Letters ’ a new poet . His published volume is a work of immense promise . His fancy is splendid .... The ‘ Love Letters ’ are twelve poems , separate , and yet intrinsically one . It is a compound lyric , with an epic theme and somewhat of an epic cast . The theme is the triumph of woman 's love . It is the story of love 's redemption . It has something of the tone , colour , and luxuriance of Solomon 's Song ; both , too , have the same theme , though treated in a different way .... The form is charming — as if the sonatas of Beethoven had been translated into poetry ! The dénouement is reached when Beethoven himself —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ The giant-singer who did storm the gates</l>
     <l n="2">Of Heaven and Hell ’ —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>is introduced in a vision . The lecturer gave a number of quotations to illustrate his points . ” — Lecture on ERIC MACKAY , by the Rev . Elvet Lewis , at the Hull Literary Institute .</p>
   <p>“ The ‘ Love Letters ’ of Eric Mackay are the handiwork of a brilliant metrical artist and poet born .... A beautiful and passionate work ; its beauty that of construction , language , imagery ,— its passion , characteristic of the artistic nature , and , while intensely human , free from any taint of vulgar coarseness .... The poem is quite original , its manner Elizabethan .... Eric Mackay is a lyrist with a singing faculty and a novel metrical form such as few lyrists have at command . With the very striking poem of ‘ Mary Arden , ’ we have at last something new said of Shakespeare , and it is said sweetly and imaginatively . ” — E. C. STEDMAN , in “ Victorian Poets , ” 21st Edition , 1893 .</p>
