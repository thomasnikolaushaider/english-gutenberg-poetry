       <l n="1">The Strike of the Fireworks</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">‘ Twas the night before the Fourth of July , the people slept serene ;</l>
       <l n="3">The fireworks were stored in the old town hall that stood</l>
       <l n="4">on the village green .</l>
       <l n="5">The steeple clock tolled the midnight hour , and at its final stroke ,</l>
       <l n="6">The fire in the queer old-fashioned stove lifted its voice and spoke ;</l>
       <l n="7">“ The earth and air have naught to do , the water , too , may play ,</l>
       <l n="8">And only fire is made to work on Independence Day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">“ I wo n't stand such injustice ! It 's wrong , beyond a doubt ,</l>
       <l n="10">And I shall take my holiday . Good-by , I 'm going out ! ”</l>
       <l n="11">Up spoke a Roman candle then , “ The principle is right !</l>
       <l n="12">Suppose we strike , and all agree we will not work to-night ! ”</l>
       <l n="13">“ My stars ! ” said a small sky-rocket . “ What an awful time there 'll be ,</l>
       <l n="14">When the whole town comes together to-night , the great display to see ! ”</l>
       <l n="15">“ Let them come , ” said a saucy pinwheel , “ yes , let them come if they like ,</l>
       <l n="16">As a delegate I 'll announce to them that the fireworks</l>
       <l n="17">are going to strike ! ”</l>
       <l n="18">“ My friends , ” said a small cap-pistol , “ this movement is all wrong ,—</l>
       <l n="19">Gunpowder , noise , and fireworks to Fourth of July belong .</l>
       <l n="20">My great ancestral musket made Independence Day ,</l>
       <l n="21">I frown on your whole conspiracy , and you are wrong , I say ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="22">And so they talked and they argued , some for and some against ,—</l>
       <l n="23">And they progressed no further than they were when they commenced .</l>
       <l n="24">Until in a burst of eloquence a queer little piece of punk</l>
       <l n="25">Arose in his place and said , “ I think we ought to show some spunk .</l>
       <l n="26">And I for one have decided , although I am no shirk ,</l>
       <l n="27">That to-day is a legal holiday and not even fire should work .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="28">“ And I am of some importance , ” — here he gave a pretentious cough ,</l>
       <l n="29">“ For without my assistance none of you could very well be put off . ”</l>
       <l n="30">“ You are right , ” said the Roman candle , “ and I think we are all agreed</l>
       <l n="31">To strike for our rights and our liberty . Hurrah ! we shall succeed ! ”</l>
       <l n="32">The dissenters cried with one accord , “ Our objections we withdraw .</l>
       <l n="33">Hurrah , hurrah for the fireworks ’ strike ! ” and they cried again , “ Hurrah ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="34">Then a match piped up with a tiny voice , “ Your splendid scheme I like .</l>
       <l n="35">I agree with all your principles and so I , too , will strike ! ”</l>
       <l n="36">Suiting the action to the word , the silly little dunce</l>
       <l n="37">Clambered down from his matchsafe and excitedly struck at once .</l>
       <l n="38">He lost his head , and he ran around among the fireworks dry ,</l>
       <l n="39">And he cried , “ Hurrah for the fireworks ’ strike ! Hurrah for the</l>
       <l n="40">Fourth of July ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="41">With his waving flame he lit the punk — a firecracker caught a spark ,—</l>
       <l n="42">Then rockets and wheels and bombs went off — no longer the place was dark !</l>
       <l n="43">The explosions made a fearful noise , the flames leaped high and higher ,</l>
       <l n="44">The village folk awoke and cried , “ The town hall is on fire ! ”</l>
       <l n="45">So the strike of the fireworks ended in a wonderful display</l>
       <l n="46">Of pyrotechnic grandeur on Independence Day !</l>

       <l n="2">Once there was a little boy who would n't go to bed ,</l>
       <l n="3">When they hinted at the subject he would only shake his head ,</l>
       <l n="4">When they asked him his intentions , he informed them pretty straight</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">As their arguments grew stronger , and their attitude more strict ,</l>
       <l n="7">I grieve to say that naughty boy just yelled and screamed and kicked .</l>
       <l n="8">And he made up awful faces , and he told them up and down</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Then Nursey lost her patience , and although it was n't right ,</l>

       <l n="12">He approved of this arrangement , and he danced a jig for joy ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">And so they all went off to bed and left him sitting there ,</l>
       <l n="15">Right in the corner by the fire in Grandpa 's big armchair .</l>
       <l n="16">He read his books and played his games ,— he even sang a song</l>
       <l n="17">And thought how lovely it would be to sit up all night long .</l>

       <l n="19">But soon his games grew stupid , and his puzzles would n't work ;</l>
       <l n="20">He drew himself up stiffly with a sudden little jerk ,</l>
       <l n="21">And he said , “ I am not sleepy , and I love to play alone —</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="23">He leaned back on the cushions like that night he had the croup ;</l>
       <l n="24">His head began to wobble and his eyes began to droop ;</l>
       <l n="25">He closed them for a minute , just to see how it would seem ,</l>
       <l n="26">And straightway he was sound asleep , and dreamed this awful dream !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="27">He thought he saw a garden filled with flowers and roses gay ,</l>
       <l n="28">A great big gardener with a hoe came walking down his way ;</l>
       <l n="29">“ Ah , ha ! ” exclaimed the gardener , as he clutched him by the head ,</l>

       <l n="32">He held the boy in one big hand , unheeding how he cried ,</l>
       <l n="33">And with the other dug a hole enormous , deep , and wide .</l>
       <l n="34">He jammed the little fellow in , and said in gruffest tone ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="36">And then the dirt was shovelled in ,— it covered up his toes ,</l>
       <l n="37">His ankles , knees , and waist and arms , and higher yet it rose .</l>
       <l n="38">For still the gardener shovelled on , not noticing his cries ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="40">Just then he gathered all his strength and gave an awful scream ,</l>
