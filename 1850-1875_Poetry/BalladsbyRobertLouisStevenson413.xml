       <head>I . THE SLAYING OF TAMATEA</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="1">
        <l n="1">It fell in the days of old , as the men of Taiarapu tell ,</l>
        <l n="2">A youth went forth to the fishing , and fortune favoured him well .</l>
        <l n="3">Tamatea his name : gullible , simple , and kind ,</l>
        <l n="4">Comely of countenance , nimble of body , empty of mind ,</l>
        <l n="5">His mother ruled him and loved him beyond the wont of a wife ,</l>
        <l n="6">Serving the lad for eyes and living herself in his life .</l>
        <l n="7">Alone from the sea and the fishing came Tamatea the fair ,</l>
        <l n="8">Urging his boat to the beach , and the mother awaited him there ,</l>
        <l n="9">- “ Long may you live ! ” said she . “ Your fishing has sped to a wish .</l>
        <l n="10">And now let us choose for the king the fairest of all your fish .</l>
        <l n="11">For fear inhabits the palace and grudging grows in the land ,</l>
        <l n="12">Marked is the sluggardly foot and marked the niggardly hand ,</l>
        <l n="13">The hours and the miles are counted , the tributes numbered and weighed ,</l>
        <l n="14">And woe to him that comes short , and woe to him that delayed ! ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="2">
        <l n="15">So spoke on the beach the mother , and counselled the wiser thing .</l>
        <l n="16">For Rahero stirred in the country and secretly mined the king .</l>
        <l n="17">Nor were the signals wanting of how the leaven wrought ,</l>
        <l n="18">In the cords of obedience loosed and the tributes grudgingly brought .</l>
        <l n="19">And when last to the temple of Oro the boat with the victim sped ,</l>
        <l n="20">And the priest uncovered the basket and looked on the face of the dead ,</l>
        <l n="21">Trembling fell upon all at sight of an ominous thing ,</l>
        <l n="22">For there was the aito { 1a } dead , and he of the house of the king .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="23">So spake on the beach the mother , matter worthy of note ,</l>
        <l n="24">And wattled a basket well , and chose a fish from the boat ;</l>
        <l n="25">And Tamatea the pliable shouldered the basket and went ,</l>
        <l n="26">And travelled , and sang as he travelled , a lad that was well content .</l>
        <l n="27">Still the way of his going was round by the roaring coast ,</l>
        <l n="28">Where the ring of the reef is broke and the trades run riot the most .</l>
        <l n="29">On his left , with smoke as of battle , the billows battered the land ;</l>
        <l n="30">Unscalable , turreted mountains rose on the inner hand .</l>
        <l n="31">And cape , and village , and river , and vale , and mountain above ,</l>
        <l n="32">Each had a name in the land for men to remember and love ;</l>
        <l n="33">And never the name of a place , but lo ! a song in its praise :</l>
        <l n="34">Ancient and unforgotten , songs of the earlier days ,</l>
        <l n="35">That the elders taught to the young , and at night , in the full of the moon ,</l>
        <l n="36">Garlanded boys and maidens sang together in tune .</l>
        <l n="37">Tamatea the placable went with a lingering foot ;</l>
        <l n="38">He sang as loud as a bird , he whistled hoarse as a flute ;</l>
        <l n="39">He broiled in the sun , he breathed in the grateful shadow of trees ,</l>
        <l n="40">In the icy stream of the rivers he waded over the knees ;</l>
        <l n="41">And still in his empty mind crowded , a thousand-fold ,</l>
        <l n="42">The deeds of the strong and the songs of the cunning heroes of old .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="43">And now was he come to a place Taiarapu honoured the most ,</l>
        <l n="44">Where a silent valley of woods debouched on the noisy coast ,</l>
        <l n="45">Spewing a level river . There was a haunt of Pai . { 1b }</l>
        <l n="46">There , in his potent youth , when his parents drove him to die ,</l>
        <l n="47">Honoura lived like a beast , lacking the lamp and the fire ,</l>
        <l n="48">Washed by the rains of the trade and clotting his hair in the mire ;</l>
        <l n="49">And there , so mighty his hands , he bent the tree to his foot -</l>
        <l n="50">So keen the spur of his hunger , he plucked it naked of fruit .</l>
        <l n="51">There , as she pondered the clouds for the shadow of coming ills ,</l>
        <l n="52">Ahupu , the woman of song , walked on high on the hills .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="5">
        <l n="53">Of these was Rahero sprung , a man of a godly race ;</l>
        <l n="54">And inherited cunning of spirit and beauty of body and face .</l>
        <l n="55">Of yore in his youth , as an aito , Rahero wandered the land ,</l>
        <l n="56">Delighting maids with his tongue , smiting men with his hand .</l>
        <l n="57">Famous he was in his youth ; but before the midst of his life</l>
        <l n="58">Paused , and fashioned a song of farewell to glory and strife .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="59">House of mine ( it went ) , house upon the sea ,</l>
        <l n="60">Belov 'd of all my fathers , more belov 'd by me !</l>
        <l n="61">Vale of the strong Honoura , deep ravine of Pai ,</l>
        <l n="62">Again in your woody summits I hear the trade-wind cry .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="7">
        <l n="63">House of mine , in your walls , strong sounds the sea ,</l>
        <l n="64">Of all sounds on earth , dearest sound to me .</l>
        <l n="65">I have heard the applause of men , I have heard it arise and die :</l>
        <l n="66">Sweeter now in my house I hear the trade-wind cry .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="8">
        <l n="67">These were the words of his singing , other the thought of his heart ;</l>
        <l n="68">For secret desire of glory vexed him , dwelling apart .</l>
        <l n="69">Lazy and crafty he was , and loved to lie in the sun ,</l>
        <l n="70">And loved the cackle of talk and the true word uttered in fun ;</l>
        <l n="71">Lazy he was , his roof was ragged , his table was lean ,</l>
        <l n="72">And the fish swam safe in his sea , and he gathered the near and the green .</l>
        <l n="73">He sat in his house and laughed , but he loathed the king of the land ,</l>
        <l n="74">And he uttered the grudging word under the covering hand .</l>
        <l n="75">Treason spread from his door ; and he looked for a day to come ,</l>
        <l n="76">A day of the crowding people , a day of the summoning drum ,</l>
        <l n="77">When the vote should be taken , the king be driven forth in disgrace ,</l>
        <l n="78">And Rahero , the laughing and lazy , sit and rule in his place ,</l>
        <l n="79">Here Tamatea came , and beheld the house on the brook ;</l>
        <l n="80">And Rahero was there by the way and covered an oven to cook . { 1c }</l>
        <l n="81">Naked he was to the loins , but the tattoo covered the lack ,</l>
        <l n="82">And the sun and the shadow of palms dappled his muscular back .</l>
        <l n="83">Swiftly he lifted his head at the fall of the coming feet ,</l>
        <l n="84">And the water sprang in his mouth with a sudden desire of meat ;</l>
        <l n="85">For he marked the basket carried , covered from flies and the sun ; { 1d }</l>
        <l n="86">And Rahero buried his fire , but the meat in his house was done .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="9">
        <l n="87">Forth he stepped ; and took , and delayed the boy , by the hand ;</l>
        <l n="88">And vaunted the joys of meat and the ancient ways of the land :</l>
        <l n="89">- “ Our sires of old in Taiarapu , they that created the race ,</l>
        <l n="90">Ate ever with eager hand , nor regarded season or place ,</l>
        <l n="91">Ate in the boat at the oar , on the way afoot ; and at night</l>
        <l n="92">Arose in the midst of dreams to rummage the house for a bite .</l>
        <l n="93">It is good for the youth in his turn to follow the way of the sire ;</l>
        <l n="94">And behold how fitting the time ! for here do I cover my fire . ”</l>
        <l n="95">- “ I see the fire for the cooking but never the meat to cook , ”</l>
        <l n="96">Said Tamatea .— “ Tut ! ” said Rahero . “ Here in the brook</l>
        <l n="97">And there in the tumbling sea , the fishes are thick as flies ,</l>
        <l n="98">Hungry like healthy men , and like pigs for savour and size :</l>
        <l n="99">Crayfish crowding the river , sea-fish thronging the sea . ”</l>
        <l n="100">- “ Well it may be , ” says the other , “ and yet be nothing to me .</l>
        <l n="101">Fain would I eat , but alas ! I have needful matter in hand ,</l>
        <l n="102">Since I carry my tribute of fish to the jealous king of the land . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="10">
        <l n="103">Now at the word a light sprang in Rahero 's eyes .</l>
        <l n="104">“ I will gain me a dinner , ” thought he , “ and lend the king a surprise . ”</l>
        <l n="105">And he took the lad by the arm , as they stood by the side of the track ,</l>
        <l n="106">And smiled , and rallied , and flattered , and pushed him forward and back .</l>
        <l n="107">It was “ You that sing like a bird , I never have heard you sing , ”</l>
        <l n="108">And “ The lads when I was a lad were none so feared of a king .</l>
        <l n="109">And of what account is an hour , when the heart is empty of guile ?</l>
        <l n="110">But come , and sit in the house and laugh with the women awhile ;</l>
        <l n="111">And I will but drop my hook , and behold ! the dinner made . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="11">
        <l n="112">So Tamatea the pliable hung up his fish in the shade</l>
        <l n="113">On a tree by the side of the way ; and Rahero carried him in ,</l>
        <l n="114">Smiling as smiles the fowler when flutters the bird to the gin ,</l>
        <l n="115">And chose him a shining hook , { 1e } and viewed it with sedulous eye ,</l>
        <l n="116">And breathed and burnished it well on the brawn of his naked thigh ,</l>
        <l n="117">And set a mat for the gull , and bade him be merry and bide ,</l>
        <l n="118">Like a man concerned for his guest , and the fishing , and nothing beside .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="12">
        <l n="119">Now when Rahero was forth , he paused and hearkened , and heard</l>
        <l n="120">The gull jest in the house and the women laugh at his word ;</l>
        <l n="121">And stealthily crossed to the side of the way , to the shady place</l>
        <l n="122">Where the basket hung on a mango ; and craft transfigured his face .</l>
        <l n="123">Deftly he opened the basket , and took of the fat of the fish ,</l>
        <l n="124">The cut of kings and chieftains , enough for a goodly dish .</l>
        <l n="125">This he wrapped in a leaf , set on the fire to cook</l>
        <l n="126">And buried ; and next the marred remains of the tribute he took ,</l>
        <l n="127">And doubled and packed them well , and covered the basket close</l>
        <l n="128">- “ There is a buffet , my king , ” quoth he , “ and a nauseous dose ! ” -</l>
        <l n="129">And hung the basket again in the shade , in a cloud of flies</l>
        <l n="130">- “ And there is a sauce to your dinner , king of the crafty eyes ! ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="13">
        <l n="131">Soon as the oven was open , the fish smelt excellent good .</l>
        <l n="132">In the shade , by the house of Rahero , down they sat to their food ,</l>
        <l n="133">And cleared the leaves { 1f } in silence , or uttered a jest and laughed ,</l>
        <l n="134">And raising the cocoanut bowls , buried their faces and quaffed .</l>
        <l n="135">But chiefly in silence they ate ; and soon as the meal was done ,</l>
        <l n="136">Rahero feigned to remember and measured the hour by the sun ,</l>
        <l n="137">And “ Tamatea , ” quoth he , “ it is time to be jogging , my lad . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="14">
        <l n="138">So Tamatea arose , doing ever the thing he was bade ,</l>
        <l n="139">And carelessly shouldered the basket , and kindly saluted his host ;</l>
        <l n="140">And again the way of his going was round by the roaring coast .</l>
        <l n="141">Long he went ; and at length was aware of a pleasant green ,</l>
        <l n="142">And the stems and shadows of palms , and roofs of lodges between</l>
        <l n="143">There sate , in the door of his palace , the king on a kingly seat ,</l>
        <l n="144">And aitos stood armed around , and the yottowas { 1g } sat at his feet .</l>
        <l n="145">But fear was a worm in his heart : fear darted his eyes ;</l>
        <l n="146">And he probed men 's faces for treasons and pondered their speech for lies .</l>
        <l n="147">To him came Tamatea , the basket slung in his hand ,</l>
        <l n="148">And paid him the due obeisance standing as vassals stand .</l>
        <l n="149">In silence hearkened the king , and closed the eyes in his face ,</l>
        <l n="150">Harbouring odious thoughts and the baseless fears of the base ;</l>
        <l n="151">In silence accepted the gift and sent the giver away .</l>
        <l n="152">So Tamatea departed , turning his back on the day .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="15">
        <l n="153">And lo ! as the king sat brooding , a rumour rose in the crowd ;</l>
        <l n="154">The yottowas nudged and whispered , the commons murmured aloud ;</l>
        <l n="155">Tittering fell upon all at sight of the impudent thing ,</l>
        <l n="156">At the sight of a gift unroyal flung in the face of a king .</l>
        <l n="157">And the face of the king turned white and red with anger and shame</l>
        <l n="158">In their midst ; and the heart in his body was water and then was flame ;</l>
        <l n="159">Till of a sudden , turning , he gripped an aito hard ,</l>
        <l n="160">A youth that stood with his omare , { 1h } one of the daily guard ,</l>
        <l n="161">And spat in his ear a command , and pointed and uttered a name ,</l>
        <l n="162">And hid in the shade of the house his impotent anger and shame .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="16">
        <l n="163">Now Tamatea the fool was far on the homeward way ,</l>
        <l n="164">The rising night in his face , behind him the dying day .</l>
        <l n="165">Rahero saw him go by , and the heart of Rahero was glad ,</l>
        <l n="166">Devising shame to the king and nowise harm to the lad ;</l>
        <l n="167">And all that dwelt by the way saw and saluted him well ,</l>
        <l n="168">For he had the face of a friend and the news of the town to tell ;</l>
        <l n="169">And pleased with the notice of folk , and pleased that his journey was done ,</l>
        <l n="170">Tamatea drew homeward , turning his back to the sun .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="17">
        <l n="171">And now was the hour of the bath in Taiarapu : far and near</l>
        <l n="172">The lovely laughter of bathers rose and delighted his ear .</l>
        <l n="173">Night massed in the valleys ; the sun on the mountain coast</l>
        <l n="174">Struck , end-long ; and above the clouds embattled their host ,</l>
        <l n="175">And glowed and gloomed on the heights ; and the heads of the palms were gems ,</l>
        <l n="176">And far to the rising eve extended the shade of their stems ;</l>
        <l n="177">And the shadow of Tamatea hovered already at home .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="18">
        <l n="178">And sudden the sound of one coming and running light as the foam</l>
        <l n="179">Struck on his ear ; and he turned , and lo ! a man on his track ,</l>
        <l n="180">Girded and armed with an omare , following hard at his back .</l>
        <l n="181">At a bound the man was upon him ;— and , or ever a word was said ,</l>
        <l n="182">The loaded end of the omare fell and laid him dead .</l>

       <head>II . THE VENGING OF TAMATEA</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="19">
        <l n="183">Thus was Rahero 's treason ; thus and no further it sped</l>
        <l n="184">The king sat safe in his place and a kindly fool was dead .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="20">
        <l n="185">But the mother of Tamatea arose with death in her eyes .</l>
        <l n="186">All night long , and the next , Taiarapu rang with her cries .</l>
        <l n="187">As when a babe in the wood turns with a chill of doubt</l>
        <l n="188">And perceives nor home , nor friends , for the trees have closed her about ,</l>
        <l n="189">The mountain rings and her breast is torn with the voice of despair :</l>
        <l n="190">So the lion-like woman idly wearied the air</l>
        <l n="191">For awhile , and pierced men 's hearing in vain , and wounded their hearts .</l>
        <l n="192">But as when the weather changes at sea , in dangerous parts ,</l>
        <l n="193">And sudden the hurricane wrack unrolls up the front of the sky ,</l>
        <l n="194">At once the ship lies idle , the sails hang silent on high ,</l>
        <l n="195">The breath of the wind that blew is blown out like the flame of a lamp ,</l>
        <l n="196">And the silent armies of death draw near with inaudible tramp :</l>
        <l n="197">So sudden , the voice of her weeping ceased ; in silence she rose</l>
        <l n="198">And passed from the house of her sorrow , a woman clothed with repose ,</l>
        <l n="199">Carrying death in her breast and sharpening death with her hand .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="21">
        <l n="200">Hither she went and thither in all the coasts of the land .</l>
        <l n="201">They tell that she feared not to slumber alone , in the dead of night ,</l>
        <l n="202">In accursed places ; beheld , unblenched , the ribbon of light { 1i }</l>
        <l n="203">Spin from temple to temple ; guided the perilous skiff ,</l>
        <l n="204">Abhorred not the paths of the mountain and trod the verge of the cliff ;</l>
        <l n="205">From end to end of the island , thought not the distance long ,</l>
        <l n="206">But forth from king to king carried the tale of her wrong .</l>
        <l n="207">To king after king , as they sat in the palace door , she came ,</l>
        <l n="208">Claiming kinship , declaiming verses , naming her name</l>
        <l n="209">And the names of all of her fathers ; and still , with a heart on the rack ,</l>
        <l n="210">Jested to capture a hearing and laughed when they jested back :</l>
        <l n="211">So would deceive them awhile , and change and return in a breath ,</l>
        <l n="212">And on all the men of Vaiau imprecate instant death ;</l>
        <l n="213">And tempt her kings — for Vaiau was a rich and prosperous land ,</l>
        <l n="214">And flatter — for who would attempt it but warriors mighty of hand ?</l>
        <l n="215">And change in a breath again and rise in a strain of song ,</l>
        <l n="216">Invoking the beaten drums , beholding the fall of the strong ,</l>
        <l n="217">Calling the fowls of the air to come and feast on the dead .</l>
        <l n="218">And they held the chin in silence , and heard her , and shook the head ;</l>
        <l n="219">For they knew the men of Taiarapu famous in battle and feast ,</l>

        <l n="221">To the land of the Namunu-ura , { 1j } to Paea , at length she came ,</l>
        <l n="222">To men who were foes to the Tevas and hated their race and name .</l>
        <l n="223">There was she well received , and spoke with Hiopa the king . { 1k }</l>
        <l n="224">And Hiopa listened , and weighed , and wisely considered the thing .</l>
        <l n="225">“ Here in the back of the isle we dwell in a sheltered place , ”</l>

        <l n="227">But far in the teeth of the wind lofty Taiarapu lies ;</l>
        <l n="228">Strong blows the wind of the trade on its seaward face , and cries</l>
        <l n="229">Aloud in the top of arduous mountains , and utters its song</l>
        <l n="230">In green continuous forests . Strong is the wind , and strong</l>
        <l n="231">And fruitful and hardy the race , famous in battle and feast ,</l>
        <l n="232">Marvellous eaters and smiters : the men of Vaiau not least .</l>
        <l n="233">Now hearken to me , my daughter , and hear a word of the wise :</l>
        <l n="234">How a strength goes linked with a weakness , two by two , like the eyes .</l>
        <l n="235">They can wield the omare well and cast the javelin far ;</l>
        <l n="236">Yet are they greedy and weak as the swine and the children are .</l>
        <l n="237">Plant we , then , here at Paea , a garden of excellent fruits ;</l>
        <l n="238">Plant we bananas and kava and taro , the king of roots ;</l>
        <l n="239">Let the pigs in Paea be tapu { 1l } and no man fish for a year ;</l>
        <l n="240">And of all the meat in Tahiti gather we threefold here .</l>
        <l n="241">So shall the fame of our plenty fill the island , and so ,</l>
        <l n="242">At last , on the tongue of rumour , go where we wish it to go .</l>
        <l n="243">Then shall the pigs of Taiarapu raise their snouts in the air ;</l>
        <l n="244">But we sit quiet and wait , as the fowler sits by the snare ,</l>
        <l n="245">And tranquilly fold our hands , till the pigs come nosing the food :</l>
        <l n="246">But meanwhile build us a house of Trotea , the stubborn wood ,</l>
        <l n="247">Bind it with incombustible thongs , set a roof to the room ,</l>
        <l n="248">Too strong for the hands of a man to dissever or fire to consume ;</l>
        <l n="249">And there , when the pigs come trotting , there shall the feast be spread ,</l>
        <l n="250">There shall the eye of the morn enlighten the feasters dead .</l>
        <l n="251">So be it done ; for I have a heart that pities your state ,</l>
        <l n="252">And Nateva and Namunu-ura are fire and water for hate . ”</l>

        <l n="253">All was done as he said , and the gardens prospered ; and now</l>
        <l n="254">The fame of their plenty went out , and word of it came to Vaiau .</l>
        <l n="255">For the men of Namunu-ura sailed , to the windward far ,</l>
        <l n="256">Lay in the offing by south where the towns of the Tevas are ,</l>
        <l n="257">And cast overboard of their plenty ; and lo ! at the Tevas feet</l>
        <l n="258">The surf on all of the beaches tumbled treasures of meat .</l>
        <l n="259">In the salt of the sea , a harvest tossed with the refluent foam ;</l>
        <l n="260">And the children gleaned it in playing , and ate and carried it home ;</l>
        <l n="261">And the elders stared and debated , and wondered and passed the jest ,</l>
        <l n="262">But whenever a guest came by eagerly questioned the guest ;</l>
        <l n="263">And little by little , from one to another , the word went round :</l>
        <l n="264">“ In all the borders of Paea the victual rots on the ground ,</l>
        <l n="265">And swine are plenty as rats . And now , when they fare to the sea ,</l>
        <l n="266">The men of the Namunu-ura glean from under the tree</l>
        <l n="267">And load the canoe to the gunwale with all that is toothsome to eat ;</l>
        <l n="268">And all day long on the sea the jaws are crushing the meat ,</l>
        <l n="269">The steersman eats at the helm , the rowers munch at the oar ,</l>
        <l n="270">And at length , when their bellies are full , overboard with the store ! ”</l>
        <l n="271">Now was the word made true , and soon as the bait was bare ,</l>
        <l n="272">All the pigs of Taiarapu raised their snouts in the air .</l>
        <l n="273">Songs were recited , and kinship was counted , and tales were told</l>
        <l n="274">How war had severed of late but peace had cemented of old</l>
        <l n="275">The clans of the island . “ To war , ” said they , “ now set we an end ,</l>
        <l n="276">And hie to the Namunu-ura even as a friend to a friend . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="24">
        <l n="277">So judged , and a day was named ; and soon as the morning broke ,</l>
        <l n="278">Canoes were thrust in the sea and the houses emptied of folk .</l>
        <l n="279">Strong blew the wind of the south , the wind that gathers the clan ;</l>
        <l n="280">Along all the line of the reef the clamorous surges ran ;</l>
        <l n="281">And the clouds were piled on the top of the island mountain-high ,</l>
        <l n="282">A mountain throned on a mountain . The fleet of canoes swept by</l>
        <l n="283">In the midst , on the green lagoon , with a crew released from care ,</l>
        <l n="284">Sailing an even water , breathing a summer air ,</l>
        <l n="285">Cheered by a cloudless sun ; and ever to left and right ,</l>
        <l n="286">Bursting surge on the reef , drenching storms on the height .</l>
        <l n="287">So the folk of Vaiau sailed and were glad all day ,</l>
        <l n="288">Coasting the palm-tree cape and crossing the populous bay</l>
        <l n="289">By all the towns of the Tevas ; and still as they bowled along ,</l>
        <l n="290">Boat would answer to boat with jest and laughter and song ,</l>
        <l n="291">And the people of all the towns trooped to the sides of the sea</l>
        <l n="292">And gazed from under the hand or sprang aloft on the tree ,</l>
        <l n="293">Hailing and cheering . Time failed them for more to do ;</l>
        <l n="294">The holiday village careened to the wind , and was gone from view</l>
        <l n="295">Swift as a passing bird ; and ever as onward it bore ,</l>
        <l n="296">Like the cry of the passing bird , bequeathed its song to the shore -</l>
        <l n="297">Desirable laughter of maids and the cry of delight of the child .</l>
        <l n="298">And the gazer , left behind , stared at the wake and smiled .</l>
        <l n="299">By all the towns of the Tevas they went , and Papara last ,</l>
        <l n="300">The home of the chief , the place of muster in war ; and passed</l>
        <l n="301">The march of the lands of the clan , to the lands of an alien folk .</l>
        <l n="302">And there , from the dusk of the shoreside palms , a column of smoke</l>
        <l n="303">Mounted and wavered and died in the gold of the setting sun ,</l>
        <l n="304">“ Paea ! ” they cried . “ It is Paea . ” And so was the voyage done .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="25">
        <l n="305">In the early fall of the night , Hiopa came to the shore ,</l>
        <l n="306">And beheld and counted the comers , and lo , they were forty score :</l>
        <l n="307">The pelting feet of the babes that ran already and played ,</l>
        <l n="308">The clean-lipped smile of the boy , the slender breasts of the maid ,</l>
        <l n="309">And mighty limbs of women , stalwart mothers of men .</l>
        <l n="310">The sires stood forth unabashed ; but a little back from his ken</l>
        <l n="311">Clustered the scarcely nubile , the lads and maids , in a ring ,</l>
        <l n="312">Fain of each other , afraid of themselves , aware of the king</l>
        <l n="313">And aping behaviour , but clinging together with hands and eyes ,</l>
        <l n="314">With looks that were kind like kisses , and laughter tender as sighs .</l>
        <l n="315">There , too , the grandsire stood , raising his silver crest ,</l>
        <l n="316">And the impotent hands of a suckling groped in his barren breast .</l>
        <l n="317">The childhood of love , the pair well married , the innocent brood ,</l>
        <l n="318">The tale of the generations repeated and ever renewed -</l>
        <l n="319">Hiopa beheld them together , all the ages of man ,</l>
        <l n="320">And a moment shook in his purpose .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="26">
        <l n="321">But these were the foes of his clan ,</l>
        <l n="322">And he trod upon pity , and came , and civilly greeted the king ,</l>
        <l n="323">And gravely entreated Rahero ; and for all that could fight or sing ,</l>
        <l n="324">And claimed a name in the land , had fitting phrases of praise ;</l>
        <l n="325">But with all who were well-descended he spoke of the ancient days .</l>
        <l n="326">And “ ‘ Tis true , ” said he , “ that in Paea the victual rots on the ground ;</l>
        <l n="327">But , friends , your number is many ; and pigs must be hunted and found ,</l>
        <l n="328">And the lads troop to the mountains to bring the feis down ,</l>
        <l n="329">And around the bowls of the kava cluster the maids of the town .</l>
        <l n="330">So , for to-night , sleep here ; but king , common , and priest</l>
        <l n="331">To-morrow , in order due , shall sit with me in the feast . ”</l>
        <l n="332">Sleepless the live-long night , Hiopa 's followers toiled .</l>
        <l n="333">The pigs screamed and were slaughtered ; the spars of the guest-house oiled ,</l>
        <l n="334">The leaves spread on the floor . In many a mountain glen</l>
        <l n="335">The moon drew shadows of trees on the naked bodies of men</l>
        <l n="336">Plucking and bearing fruits ; and in all the bounds of the town</l>
        <l n="337">Red glowed the cocoanut fires , and were buried and trodden down .</l>
        <l n="338">Thus did seven of the yottowas toil with their tale of the clan ,</l>
        <l n="339">But the eighth wrought with his lads , hid from the sight of man .</l>
        <l n="340">In the deeps of the woods they laboured , piling the fuel high</l>
        <l n="341">In fagots , the load of a man , fuel seasoned and dry ,</l>
        <l n="342">Thirsty to seize upon fire and apt to blurt into flame .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="27">
        <l n="343">And now was the day of the feast . The forests , as morning came ,</l>
        <l n="344">Tossed in the wind , and the peaks quaked in the blaze of the day</l>
        <l n="345">And the cocoanuts showered on the ground , rebounding and rolling away :</l>
        <l n="346">A glorious morn for a feast , a famous wind for a fire .</l>
        <l n="347">To the hall of feasting Hiopa led them , mother and sire</l>

        <l n="350">And for every three , a pig , tenderly cooked in the ground ,</l>
        <l n="351">Waited , and fei , the staff of life , heaped in a mound</l>
        <l n="352">For each where he sat ;— for each , bananas roasted and raw</l>
        <l n="353">Piled with a bountiful hand , as for horses hay and straw</l>

        <l n="355">And plentiful vessels of sauce , and breadfruit gilt in the fire ; -</l>
        <l n="356">And kava was common as water . Feasts have there been ere now ,</l>
        <l n="357">And many , but never a feast like that of the folk of Vaiau .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="28">
        <l n="358">All day long they ate with the resolute greed of brutes ,</l>
        <l n="359">And turned from the pigs to the fish , and again from the fish to the fruits ,</l>
        <l n="360">And emptied the vessels of sauce , and drank of the kava deep ;</l>
        <l n="361">Till the young lay stupid as stones , and the strongest nodded to sleep .</l>
        <l n="362">Sleep that was mighty as death and blind as a moonless night</l>
        <l n="363">Tethered them hand and foot ; and their souls were drowned , and the light</l>
        <l n="364">Was cloaked from their eyes . Senseless together , the old and the young ,</l>
        <l n="365">The fighter deadly to smite and the prater cunning of tongue ,</l>
        <l n="366">The woman wedded and fruitful , inured to the pangs of birth ,</l>
        <l n="367">And the maid that knew not of kisses , blindly sprawled on the earth .</l>
        <l n="368">From the hall Hiopa the king and his chiefs came stealthily forth .</l>
        <l n="369">Already the sun hung low and enlightened the peaks of the north ;</l>
        <l n="370">But the wind was stubborn to die and blew as it blows at morn ,</l>
        <l n="371">Showering the nuts in the dusk , and e'en as a banner is torn ,</l>
        <l n="372">High on the peaks of the island , shattered the mountain cloud .</l>
        <l n="373">And now at once , at a signal , a silent , emulous crowd</l>
        <l n="374">Set hands to the work of death , hurrying to and fro ,</l>
        <l n="375">Like ants , to furnish the fagots , building them broad and low ,</l>
        <l n="376">And piling them high and higher around the walls of the hall .</l>
        <l n="377">Silence persisted within , for sleep lay heavy on all ;</l>
        <l n="378">But the mother of Tamatea stood at Hiopa 's side ,</l>
        <l n="379">And shook for terror and joy like a girl that is a bride .</l>
        <l n="380">Night fell on the toilers , and first Hiopa the wise</l>
        <l n="381">Made the round of the house , visiting all with his eyes ;</l>
        <l n="382">And all was piled to the eaves , and fuel blockaded the door ;</l>
        <l n="383">And within , in the house beleaguered , slumbered the forty score .</l>
        <l n="384">Then was an aito dispatched and came with fire in his hand ,</l>
        <l n="385">And Hiopa took it .— “ Within , ” said he , “ is the life of a land ;</l>
        <l n="386">And behold ! I breathe on the coal , I breathe on the dales of the east ,</l>
        <l n="387">And silence falls on forest and shore ; the voice of the feast</l>
        <l n="388">Is quenched , and the smoke of cooking ; the rooftree decays and falls</l>
        <l n="389">On the empty lodge , and the winds subvert deserted walls . ”</l>

        <l n="390">Therewithal , to the fuel , he laid the glowing coal ;</l>

       <head>III . RAHERO</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="32">
        <l n="412">Rahero was there in the hall asleep : beside him his wife ,</l>
        <l n="413">Comely , a mirthful woman , one that delighted in life ;</l>
        <l n="414">And a girl that was ripe for marriage , shy and sly as a mouse ;</l>
        <l n="415">And a boy , a climber of trees : all the hopes of his house .</l>
        <l n="416">Unwary , with open hands , he slept in the midst of his folk ,</l>
        <l n="417">And dreamed that he heard a voice crying without , and awoke ,</l>
        <l n="418">Leaping blindly afoot like one from a dream that he fears .</l>
        <l n="419">A hellish glow and clouds were about him ;— it roared in his ears</l>
        <l n="420">Like the sound of the cataract fall that plunges sudden and steep ;</l>
        <l n="421">And Rahero swayed as he stood , and his reason was still asleep .</l>
        <l n="422">Now the flame struck hard on the house , wind-wielded , a fracturing blow ,</l>
        <l n="423">And the end of the roof was burst and fell on the sleepers below ;</l>
        <l n="424">And the lofty hall , and the feast , and the prostrate bodies of folk ,</l>
        <l n="425">Shone red in his eyes a moment , and then were swallowed of smoke .</l>
        <l n="426">In the mind of Rahero clearness came ; and he opened his throat ;</l>
        <l n="427">And as when a squall comes sudden , the straining sail of a boat</l>
        <l n="428">Thunders aloud and bursts , so thundered the voice of the man .</l>
        <l n="429">- “ The wind and the rain ! ” he shouted , the mustering word of the clan , { 1n }</l>
        <l n="430">And “ up ! ” and “ to arms men of Vaiau ! ” But silence replied ,</l>
        <l n="431">Or only the voice of the gusts of the fire , and nothing beside .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="33">
        <l n="432">Rahero stooped and groped . He handled his womankind ,</l>
        <l n="433">But the fumes of the fire and the kava had quenched the life of their mind ,</l>
        <l n="434">And they lay like pillars prone ; and his hand encountered the boy ,</l>
        <l n="435">And there sprang in the gloom of his soul a sudden lightning of joy .</l>
        <l n="436">“ Him can I save ! ” he thought , “ if I were speedy enough . ”</l>
        <l n="437">And he loosened the cloth from his loins , and swaddled the child in the</l>
        <l n="438">stuff ;</l>
        <l n="439">And about the strength of his neck he knotted the burden well .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="34">
        <l n="440">There where the roof had fallen , it roared like the mouth of hell .</l>
        <l n="441">Thither Rahero went , stumbling on senseless folk ,</l>
        <l n="442">And grappled a post of the house , and began to climb in the smoke :</l>
        <l n="443">The last alive of Vaiau ; and the son borne by the sire .</l>
        <l n="444">The post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire ,</l>
        <l n="445">And the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and thighs ;</l>
        <l n="446">And the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his eyes ;</l>
        <l n="447">And still he climbed , and came to the top , the place of proof ,</l>
        <l n="448">And thrust a hand through the flame , and clambered alive on the roof .</l>
        <l n="449">But even as he did so , the wind , in a garment of flames and pain ,</l>
        <l n="450">Wrapped him from head to heel ; and the waistcloth parted in twain ;</l>
        <l n="451">And the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="35">
        <l n="452">About the blazing feast-house clustered the eyes of the foe ,</l>
        <l n="453">Watching , hand upon weapon , lest ever a soul should flee ,</l>
        <l n="454">Shading the brow from the glare , straining the neck to see</l>
        <l n="455">Only , to leeward , the flames in the wind swept far and wide ,</l>
        <l n="456">And the forest sputtered on fire ; and there might no man abide .</l>
        <l n="457">Thither Rahero crept , and dropped from the burning eaves ,</l>
        <l n="458">And crouching low to the ground , in a treble covert of leaves</l>
        <l n="459">And fire and volleying smoke , ran for the life of his soul</l>
        <l n="460">Unseen ; and behind him under a furnace of ardent coal ,</l>
        <l n="461">Cairned with a wonder of flame , and blotting the night with smoke ,</l>
        <l n="462">Blazed and were smelted together the bones of all his folk .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="36">
        <l n="463">He fled unguided at first ; but hearing the breakers roar ,</l>
        <l n="464">Thitherward shaped his way , and came at length to the shore .</l>
        <l n="465">Sound-limbed he was : dry-eyed ; but smarted in every part ;</l>
        <l n="466">And the mighty cage of his ribs heaved on his straining heart</l>
        <l n="467">With sorrow and rage . And “ Fools ! ” he cried , “ fools of Vaiau ,</l>
        <l n="468">Heads of swine — gluttons — Alas ! and where are they now ?</l>
        <l n="469">Those that I played with , those that nursed me , those that I nursed ?</l>
        <l n="470">God , and I outliving them ! I , the least and the worst -</l>
        <l n="471">I , that thought myself crafty , snared by this herd of swine ,</l>

        <l n="473">All !— my friends and my fathers — the silver heads of yore</l>
        <l n="474">That trooped to the council , the children that ran to the open door</l>
        <l n="475">Crying with innocent voices and clasping a father 's knees !</l>
        <l n="476">And mine , my wife — my daughter — my sturdy climber of trees</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="37">
        <l n="478">Thus in the dusk of the night ,</l>
        <l n="479">( For clouds rolled in the sky and the moon was swallowed from sight ,)</l>
        <l n="480">Pacing and gnawing his fists , Rahero raged by the shore .</l>
        <l n="481">Vengeance : that must be his . But much was to do before ;</l>
        <l n="482">And first a single life to be snatched from a deadly place ,</l>
        <l n="483">A life , the root of revenge , surviving plant of the race :</l>
        <l n="484">And next the race to be raised anew , and the lands of the clan</l>
        <l n="485">Repeopled . So Rahero designed , a prudent man</l>
        <l n="486">Even in wrath , and turned for the means of revenge and escape :</l>
        <l n="487">A boat to be seized by stealth , a wife to be taken by rape .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="38">
        <l n="488">Still was the dark lagoon ; beyond on the coral wall ,</l>
        <l n="489">He saw the breakers shine , he heard them bellow and fall .</l>
        <l n="490">Alone , on the top of the reef , a man with a flaming brand</l>
        <l n="491">Walked , gazing and pausing , a fish-spear poised in his hand .</l>
        <l n="492">The foam boiled to his calf when the mightier breakers came ,</l>
        <l n="493">And the torch shed in the wind scattering tufts of flame .</l>
        <l n="494">Afar on the dark lagoon a canoe lay idly at wait :</l>
        <l n="495">A figure dimly guiding it : surely the fisherman 's mate .</l>
        <l n="496">Rahero saw and he smiled . He straightened his mighty thews :</l>
        <l n="497">Naked , with never a weapon , and covered with scorch and bruise ,</l>
        <l n="498">He straightened his arms , he filled the void of his body with breath ,</l>
        <l n="499">And , strong as the wind in his manhood , doomed the fisher to death .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="39">
        <l n="500">Silent he entered the water , and silently swam , and came</l>
        <l n="501">There where the fisher walked , holding on high the flame .</l>
        <l n="502">Loud on the pier of the reef volleyed the breach of the sea ;</l>
        <l n="503">And hard at the back of the man , Rahero crept to his knee</l>
        <l n="504">On the coral , and suddenly sprang and seized him , the elder hand</l>
        <l n="505">Clutching the joint of his throat , the other snatching the brand</l>
        <l n="506">Ere it had time to fall , and holding it steady and high .</l>
        <l n="507">Strong was the fisher , brave , and swift of mind and of eye -</l>
        <l n="508">Strongly he threw in the clutch ; but Rahero resisted the strain ,</l>
        <l n="509">And jerked , and the spine of life snapped with a crack in twain ,</l>
        <l n="510">And the man came slack in his hands and tumbled a lump at his feet .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="40">
        <l n="511">One moment : and there , on the reef , where the breakers whitened and beat ,</l>
        <l n="512">Rahero was standing alone , glowing and scorched and bare ,</l>
        <l n="513">A victor unknown of any , raising the torch in the air .</l>
        <l n="514">But once he drank of his breath , and instantly set him to fish</l>
        <l n="515">Like a man intent upon supper at home and a savoury dish .</l>
        <l n="516">For what should the woman have seen ? A man with a torch — and then</l>
        <l n="517">A moment 's blur of the eyes — and a man with a torch again .</l>
        <l n="518">And the torch had scarcely been shaken . “ Ah , surely , ” Rahero said ,</l>
        <l n="519">“ She will deem it a trick of the eyes , a fancy born in the head ;</l>
        <l n="520">But time must be given the fool to nourish a fool 's belief . ”</l>
        <l n="521">So for a while , a sedulous fisher , he walked the reef ,</l>
        <l n="522">Pausing at times and gazing , striking at times with the spear :</l>
        <l n="523">- Lastly , uttered the call ; and even as the boat drew near ,</l>
        <l n="524">Like a man that was done with its use , tossed the torch in the sea .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="41">
        <l n="525">Lightly he leaped on the boat beside the woman ; and she</l>
        <l n="526">Lightly addressed him , and yielded the paddle and place to sit ;</l>
        <l n="527">For now the torch was extinguished the night was black as the pit</l>
        <l n="528">Rahero set him to row , never a word he spoke ,</l>
        <l n="529">And the boat sang in the water urged by his vigorous stroke .</l>
        <l n="530">- “ What ails you ? ” the woman asked , “ and why did you drop the brand ?</l>
        <l n="531">We have only to kindle another as soon as we come to land . ”</l>
        <l n="532">Never a word Rahero replied , but urged the canoe .</l>
        <l n="533">And a chill fell on the woman .— “ Atta ! speak ! is it you ?</l>
        <l n="534">Speak ! Why are you silent ? Why do you bend aside ?</l>
        <l n="535">Wherefore steer to the seaward ? ” thus she panted and cried .</l>
        <l n="536">Never a word from the oarsman , toiling there in the dark ;</l>
        <l n="537">But right for a gate of the reef he silently headed the bark ,</l>
        <l n="538">And wielding the single paddle with passionate sweep on sweep ,</l>
        <l n="539">Drove her , the little fitted , forth on the open deep .</l>
        <l n="540">And fear , there where she sat , froze the woman to stone :</l>
        <l n="541">Not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone ;</l>
        <l n="542">But a keener fear of the night , the dark , and the ghostly hour ,</l>
        <l n="543">And the thing that drove the canoe with more than a mortal 's power</l>
        <l n="544">And more than a mortal 's boldness . For much she knew of the dead</l>
        <l n="545">That haunt and fish upon reefs , toiling , like men , for bread ,</l>
        <l n="546">And traffic with human fishers , or slay them and take their ware ,</l>
        <l n="547">Till the hour when the star of the dead { 1o } goes down , and the morning air</l>
        <l n="548">Blows , and the cocks are singing on shore . And surely she knew</l>
        <l n="549">The speechless thing at her side belonged to the grave . { 1p }</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="42">
        <l n="550">It blew</l>
        <l n="551">All night from the south ; all night , Rahero contended and kept</l>
        <l n="552">The prow to the cresting sea ; and , silent as though she slept ,</l>
        <l n="553">The woman huddled and quaked . And now was the peep of day .</l>
        <l n="554">High and long on their left the mountainous island lay ;</l>
        <l n="555">And over the peaks of Taiarapu arrows of sunlight struck .</l>
        <l n="556">On shore the birds were beginning to sing : the ghostly ruck</l>
        <l n="557">Of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave ;</l>
        <l n="558">And here on the sea , the woman , waxing suddenly brave ,</l>
        <l n="559">Turned her swiftly about and looked in the face of the man .</l>
        <l n="560">And sure he was none that she knew , none of her country or clan :</l>
        <l n="561">A stranger , mother-naked , and marred with the marks of fire ,</l>
        <l n="562">But comely and great of stature , a man to obey and admire .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="43">
        <l n="563">And Rahero regarded her also , fixed , with a frowning face ,</l>
        <l n="564">Judging the woman 's fitness to mother a warlike race .</l>
        <l n="565">Broad of shoulder , ample of girdle , long in the thigh ,</l>
        <l n="566">Deep of bosom she was , and bravely supported his eye .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="44">
        <l n="567">“ Woman , ” said he , “ last night the men of your folk -</l>

        <l n="569">It was done like cowards ; and I , a mighty man of my hands ,</l>

        <l n="572">Before your mother was born , the die of to-day was thrown</l>

     <p>NOTES TO THE SONG OF RAHERO</p>
     <p>INTRODUCTION .— This tale , of which I have not consciously changed a single feature , I received from tradition . It is highly popular through all the country of the eight Tevas , the clan to which Rahero belonged ; and particularly in Taiarapu , the windward peninsula of Tahiti , where he lived . I have heard from end to end two versions ; and as many as five different persons have helped me with details . There seems no reason why the tale should not be true .</p>
     <p>{ 1a } “ The aito , ” quasi champion , or brave . One skilled in the use of some weapon , who wandered the country challenging distinguished rivals and taking part in local quarrels . It was in the natural course of his advancement to be at last employed by a chief , or king ; and it would then be a part of his duties to purvey the victim for sacrifice . One of the doomed families was indicated ; the aito took his weapon and went forth alone ; a little behind him bearers followed with the sacrificial basket . Sometimes the victim showed fight , sometimes prevailed ; more often , without doubt , he fell . But whatever body was found , the bearers indifferently took up .</p>
     <p>{ 1b } “ Pai , ” “ Honoura , ” and “ Ahupu . ” Legendary persons of Tahiti , all natives of Taiarapu . Of the first two , I have collected singular although imperfect legends , which I hope soon to lay before the public in another place . Of Ahupu , except in snatches of song , little memory appears to linger . She dwelt at least about Tepari ,— “ the sea-cliffs , ” — the eastern fastness of the isle ; walked by paths known only to herself upon the mountains ; was courted by dangerous suitors who came swimming from adjacent islands , and defended and rescued ( as I gather ) by the loyalty of native fish . My anxiety to learn more of “ Ahupu Vehine ” became ( during my stay in Taiarapu ) a cause of some diversion to that mirthful people , the inhabitants .</p>
     <p>{ 1c } “ Covered an oven . ” The cooking fire is made in a hole in the ground , and is then buried .</p>
     <p>{ 1d } “ Flies . ” This is perhaps an anachronism . Even speaking of to-day in Tahiti , the phrase would have to be understood as referring mainly to mosquitoes , and these only in watered valleys with close woods , such as I suppose to form the surroundings of Rahero 's homestead . Quarter of a mile away , where the air moves freely , you shall look in vain for one .</p>
     <p>{ 1e } “ Hook ” of mother-of-pearl . Bright-hook fishing , and that with the spear , appear to be the favourite native methods .</p>
     <p>{ 1f } “ Leaves , ” the plates of Tahiti .</p>
     <p>{ 1g } “ Yottowas , ” so spelt for convenience of pronunciation , quasi Tacksmen in the Scottish Highlands . The organisation of eight subdistricts and eight yottowas to a division , which was in use ( until yesterday ) among the Tevas , I have attributed without authority to the next clan : see page 33 .</p>
     <p>{ 1h } “ Omare , ” pronounce as a dactyl . A loaded quarter-staff , one of the two favourite weapons of the Tahitian brave ; the javelin , or casting spear , was the other .</p>
     <p>{ 1i } “ The ribbon of light . ” Still to be seen ( and heard ) spinning from one marae to another on Tahiti ; or so I have it upon evidence that would rejoice the Psychical Society .</p>
     <p>{ 1j } “ Namunu-ura . ” The complete name is Namunu-ura te aropa . Why it should be pronounced Namunu , dactyllically , I cannot see , but so I have always heard it . This was the clan immediately beyond the Tevas on the south coast of the island . At the date of the tale the clan organisation must have been very weak . There is no particular mention of Tamatea 's mother going to Papara , to the head chief of her own clan , which would appear her natural recourse . On the other hand , she seems to have visited various lesser chiefs among the Tevas , and these to have excused themselves solely on the danger of the enterprise . The broad distinction here drawn between Nateva and Namunu-ura is therefore not impossibly anachronistic .</p>
     <p>{ 1k } “ Hiopa the king . ” Hiopa was really the name of the king ( chief ) of Vaiau ; but I could never learn that of the king of Paea — pronounce to rhyme with the Indian ayah — and I gave the name where it was most needed . This note must appear otiose indeed to readers who have never heard of either of these two gentlemen ; and perhaps there is only one person in the world capable at once of reading my verses and spying the inaccuracy . For him , for Mr. Tati Salmon , hereditary high chief of the Tevas , the note is solely written : a small attention from a clansman to his chief .</p>
     <p>{ 1l } “ Let the pigs be tapu . ” It is impossible to explain tapu in a note ; we have it as an English word , taboo . Suffice it , that a thing which was tapu must not be touched , nor a place that was tapu visited .</p>
     <p>{ 1m } “ Fish , the food of desire . ” There is a special word in the Tahitian language to signify HUNGERING AFTER FISH . I may remark that here is one of my chief difficulties about the whole story . How did king , commons , women , and all come to eat together at this feast ? But it troubled none of my numerous authorities ; so there must certainly be some natural explanation .</p>
     <p>{ 1n } “ The mustering word of the clan . ”</p>

     <p>{ 1o } “ The star of the dead . ” Venus as a morning star . I have collected much curious evidence as to this belief . The dead retain their taste for a fish diet , enter into copartnery with living fishers , and haunt the reef and the lagoon . The conclusion attributed to the nameless lady of the legend would be reached to-day , under the like circumstances , by ninety per cent of Polynesians : and here I probably understate by one-tenth .</p>

       <head>I . THE PRIEST 'S VIGIL</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="1">
        <l n="1">In all the land of the tribe was neither fish nor fruit ,</l>
        <l n="2">And the deepest pit of popoi stood empty to the foot . { 2a }</l>
        <l n="3">The clans upon the left and the clans upon the right</l>
        <l n="4">Now oiled their carven maces and scoured their daggers bright ;</l>
        <l n="5">They gat them to the thicket , to the deepest of the shade ,</l>
        <l n="6">And lay with sleepless eyes in the deadly ambuscade .</l>
        <l n="7">And oft in the starry even the song of morning rose ,</l>
        <l n="8">What time the oven smoked in the country of their foes ;</l>
        <l n="9">For oft to loving hearts , and waiting ears and sight ,</l>
        <l n="10">The lads that went to forage returned not with the night .</l>
        <l n="11">Now first the children sickened , and then the women paled ,</l>
        <l n="12">And the great arms of the warrior no more for war availed .</l>
        <l n="13">Hushed was the deep drum , discarded was the dance ;</l>
        <l n="14">And those that met the priest now glanced at him askance .</l>
        <l n="15">The priest was a man of years , his eyes were ruby-red , { 2b }</l>
        <l n="16">He neither feared the dark nor the terrors of the dead ,</l>
        <l n="17">He knew the songs of races , the names of ancient date ;</l>
        <l n="18">And the beard upon his bosom would have bought the chief 's estate .</l>
        <l n="19">He dwelt in a high-built lodge , hard by the roaring shore ,</l>
        <l n="20">Raised on a noble terrace and with tikis { 2c } at the door .</l>
        <l n="21">Within it was full of riches , for he served his nation well ,</l>
        <l n="22">And full of the sound of breakers , like the hollow of a shell .</l>
        <l n="23">For weeks he let them perish , gave never a helping sign ,</l>
        <l n="24">But sat on his oiled platform to commune with the divine ,</l>
        <l n="25">But sat on his high terrace , with the tikis by his side ,</l>
        <l n="26">And stared on the blue ocean , like a parrot , ruby-eyed .</l>
        <l n="27">Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height :</l>
        <l n="28">Out on the round of the sea the gems of the morning light ,</l>
        <l n="29">Up from the round of the sea the streamers of the sun ; -</l>
        <l n="30">But down in the depths of the valley the day was not begun .</l>
        <l n="31">In the blue of the woody twilight burned red the cocoa-husk ,</l>
        <l n="32">And the women and men of the clan went forth to bathe in the dusk ,</l>
        <l n="33">A word that began to go round , a word , a whisper , a start :</l>
        <l n="34">Hope that leaped in the bosom , fear that knocked on the heart :</l>
        <l n="35">“ See , the priest is not risen — look , for his door is fast !</l>
        <l n="36">He is going to name the victims ; he is going to help us at last . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="2">
        <l n="37">Thrice rose the sun to noon ; and ever , like one of the dead ,</l>
        <l n="38">The priest lay still in his house with the roar of the sea in his head ;</l>
        <l n="39">There was never a foot on the floor , there was never a whisper of speech ;</l>
        <l n="40">Only the leering tikis stared on the blinding beach .</l>
        <l n="41">Again were the mountains fired , again the morning broke ;</l>
        <l n="42">And all the houses lay still , but the house of the priest awoke .</l>
        <l n="43">Close in their covering roofs lay and trembled the clan ,</l>
        <l n="44">But the aged , red-eyed priest ran forth like a lunatic man ;</l>
        <l n="45">And the village panted to see him in the jewels of death again ,</l>
        <l n="46">In the silver beards of the old and the hair of women slain .</l>
        <l n="47">Frenzy shook in his limbs , frenzy shone in his eyes ,</l>
        <l n="48">And still and again as he ran , the valley rang with his cries .</l>
        <l n="49">All day long in the land , by cliff and thicket and den ,</l>
        <l n="50">He ran his lunatic rounds , and howled for the flesh of men ;</l>
        <l n="51">All day long he ate not , nor ever drank of the brook ;</l>
        <l n="52">And all day long in their houses the people listened and shook -</l>
        <l n="53">All day long in their houses they listened with bated breath ,</l>
        <l n="54">And never a soul went forth , for the sight of the priest was death .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="55">Three were the days of his running , as the gods appointed of yore ,</l>
        <l n="56">Two the nights of his sleeping alone in the place of gore :</l>
        <l n="57">The drunken slumber of frenzy twice he drank to the lees ,</l>
        <l n="58">On the sacred stones of the High-place under the sacred trees ;</l>
        <l n="59">With a lamp at his ashen head he lay in the place of the feast ,</l>
        <l n="60">And the sacred leaves of the banyan rustled around the priest .</l>
        <l n="61">Last , when the stated even fell upon terrace and tree ,</l>
        <l n="62">And the shade of the lofty island lay leagues away to sea ,</l>
        <l n="63">And all the valleys of verdure were heavy with manna and musk ,</l>
        <l n="64">The wreck of the red-eyed priest came gasping home in the dusk .</l>
        <l n="65">He reeled across the village , he staggered along the shore ,</l>
        <l n="66">And between the leering tikis crept groping through his door .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="67">There went a stir through the lodges , the voice of speech awoke ;</l>
        <l n="68">Once more from the builded platforms arose the evening smoke .</l>
        <l n="69">And those who were mighty in war , and those renowned for an art</l>
        <l n="70">Sat in their stated seats and talked of the morrow apart .</l>

        <l n="71">Hark ! away in the woods — for the ears of love are sharp -</l>
        <l n="72">Stealthily , quietly touched , the note of the one-stringed harp . { 2d }</l>

        <l n="81">Swift as a cat she runs , with her garment gathered high ,</l>

        <l n="295">It chanced that as Rua sat in the valley of silent falls ,</l>
        <l n="296">He heard a calling of doves from high on the cliffy walls .</l>
        <l n="297">Fire had fashioned of yore , and time had broken , the rocks ;</l>
        <l n="298">There were rooting crannies for trees and nesting-places for flocks ;</l>
        <l n="299">And he saw on the top of the cliffs , looking up from the pit of the shade ,</l>
        <l n="300">A flicker of wings and sunshine , and trees that swung in the trade .</l>
        <l n="301">“ The trees swing in the trade , ” quoth Rua , doubtful of words ,</l>
        <l n="302">“ And the sun stares from the sky , but what should trouble the birds ? ”</l>
        <l n="303">Up from the shade he gazed , where high the parapet shone ,</l>
        <l n="304">And he was aware of a ledge and of things that moved thereon .</l>
        <l n="305">“ What manner of things are these ? Are they spirits abroad by day ?</l>
        <l n="306">Or the foes of my clan that are come , bringing death by a perilous way ? ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="29">
        <l n="307">The valley was gouged like a vessel , and round like the vessel 's lip ,</l>
        <l n="308">With a cape of the side of the hill thrust forth like the bows of a ship .</l>
        <l n="309">On the top of the face of the cape a volley of sun struck fair ,</l>
        <l n="310">And the cape overhung like a chin a gulph of sunless air .</l>
        <l n="311">“ Silence , heart ! What is that ?— that , that flickered and shone ,</l>
        <l n="312">Into the sun for an instant , and in an instant gone ?</l>
        <l n="313">Was it a warrior 's plume , a warrior 's girdle of hair ?</l>

       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="30">
        <l n="315">Once and again Rua saw , in the trenchant edge of the sky ,</l>
        <l n="316">The giddy conjuring done . And then , in the blink of an eye ,</l>
        <l n="317">A scream caught in with the breath , a whirling packet of limbs ,</l>
        <l n="318">A lump that dived in the gulph , more swift than a dolphin swims ;</l>
        <l n="319">And there was the lump at his feet , and eyes were alive in the lump .</l>
        <l n="320">Sick was the soul of Rua , ambushed close in a clump ;</l>
        <l n="321">Sick of soul he drew near , making his courage stout ;</l>
        <l n="322">And he looked in the face of the thing , and the life of the thing went out .</l>
        <l n="323">And he gazed on the tattooed limbs , and , behold , he knew the man :</l>

        <l n="325">Hoka a moment since that stepped in the loop of the rope ,</l>
        <l n="326">Filled with the lust of war , and alive with courage and hope .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="31">
        <l n="327">Again to the giddy cornice Rua lifted his eyes ,</l>
        <l n="328">And again beheld men passing in the armpit of the skies .</l>
        <l n="329">“ Foes of my race ! ” cried Rua , “ the mouth of Rua is true :</l>
        <l n="330">Never a shark in the deep is nobler of soul than you .</l>
        <l n="331">There was never a nobler foray , never a bolder plan ;</l>

        <l n="334">“ Counts it honour to hate you , honour to fall by your spears . ”</l>
        <l n="335">And Rua straightened his back . “ O Vais , a scheme for a scheme ! ”</l>
        <l n="336">Cried Rua and turned and descended the turbulent stair of the stream ,</l>
        <l n="337">Leaping from rock to rock as the water-wagtail at home</l>
        <l n="338">Flits through resonant valleys and skims by boulder and foam .</l>
        <l n="339">And Rua burst from the glen and leaped on the shore of the brook ,</l>
        <l n="340">And straight for the roofs of the clan his vigorous way he took .</l>
        <l n="341">Swift were the heels of his flight , and loud behind as he went</l>
        <l n="342">Rattled the leaping stones on the line of his long descent .</l>
        <l n="343">And ever he thought as he ran , and caught at his gasping breath ,</l>
        <l n="344">“ O the fool of a Rua , Rua that runs to his death !</l>
        <l n="345">But the right is the right , ” thought Rua , and ran like the wind on the foam ,</l>
        <l n="346">“ The right is the right for ever , and home for ever home .</l>
        <l n="347">For what though the oven smoke ? And what though I die ere morn ?</l>
        <l n="348">There was I nourished and tended , and there was Taheia born . ”</l>
        <l n="349">Noon was high on the High-place , the second noon of the feast ;</l>
        <l n="350">And heat and shameful slumber weighed on people and priest ;</l>
        <l n="351">And the heart drudged slow in bodies heavy with monstrous meals ;</l>
        <l n="352">And the senseless limbs were scattered abroad like spokes of wheels ;</l>
        <l n="353">And crapulous women sat and stared at the stones anigh</l>
        <l n="354">With a bestial droop of the lip and a swinish rheum in the eye .</l>
        <l n="355">As about the dome of the bees in the time for the drones to fall ,</l>
        <l n="356">The dead and the maimed are scattered , and lie , and stagger , and crawl ;</l>
        <l n="357">So on the grades of the terrace , in the ardent eye of the day ,</l>
        <l n="358">The half-awake and the sleepers clustered and crawled and lay ;</l>
        <l n="359">And loud as the dome of the bees , in the time of a swarming horde ,</l>
        <l n="360">A horror of many insects hung in the air and roared .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="32">
        <l n="361">Rua looked and wondered ; he said to himself in his heart :</l>
        <l n="362">“ Poor are the pleasures of life , and death is the better part . ”</l>
        <l n="363">But lo ! on the higher benches a cluster of tranquil folk</l>
        <l n="364">Sat by themselves , nor raised their serious eyes , nor spoke :</l>
        <l n="365">Women with robes unruffled and garlands duly arranged ,</l>

        <l n="370">And he uttered a summoning shout and called on the clan to rise .</l>
        <l n="371">Over against him at once , in the spotted shade of the trees ,</l>
        <l n="372">Owlish and blinking creatures scrambled to hands and knees ;</l>
        <l n="373">On the grades of the sacred terrace , the driveller woke to fear ,</l>
        <l n="374">And the hand of the ham-drooped warrior brandished a wavering spear .</l>
        <l n="375">And Rua folded his arms , and scorn discovered his teeth ;</l>
        <l n="376">Above the war-crowd gibbered , and Rua stood smiling beneath .</l>
        <l n="377">Thick , like leaves in the autumn , faint , like April sleet ,</l>
        <l n="378">Missiles from tremulous hands quivered around his feet ;</l>
        <l n="379">And Taheia leaped from her place ; and the priest , the ruby-eyed ,</l>
        <l n="380">Ran to the front of the terrace , and brandished his arms , and cried :</l>
        <l n="381">“ Hold , O fools , he brings tidings ! ” and “ Hold , ‘ tis the love of my heart ! ”</l>
        <l n="382">Till lo ! in front of the terrace , Rua pierced with a dart .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="33">
        <l n="383">Taheia cherished his head , and the aged priest stood by ,</l>

        <l n="391">By the head of the tapu cleft , with death and fire in their hand ,</l>

      <head>NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE</head>
      <head>In this ballad , I have strung together some of the more striking particularities of the Marquesas . It rests upon no authority ; it is in no sense , like “ Rahero , ” a native story ; but a patchwork of details of manners and the impressions of a traveller . It may seem strange , when the scene is laid upon these profligate islands , to make the story hinge on love . But love is not less known in the Marquesas than elsewhere ; nor is there any cause of suicide more common in the islands .</head>
       <l n="1">{ 2a } “ Pit of Popoi . ” Where the breadfruit was stored for preservation .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>{ 2b } “ Ruby-red . ” The priest 's eyes were probably red from the abuse of kava . His beard ( ib . ) is said to be worth an estate ; for the beards of old men are the favourite head adornment of the Marquesans , as the hair of women formed their most costly girdle . The former , among this generally beardless and short-lived people , fetch to-day considerable sums .</p>
     <p>{ 2c } “ Tikis . ” The tiki is an ugly image hewn out of wood or stone .</p>
     <p>{ 2d } “ The one-stringed harp . ” Usually employed for serenades .</p>
     <p>{ 2e } “ The sacred cabin of palm . ” Which , however , no woman could approach . I do not know where women were tattooed ; probably in the common house , or in the bush , for a woman was a creature of small account . I must guard the reader against supposing Taheia was at all disfigured ; the art of the Marquesan tattooer is extreme ; and she would appear to be clothed in a web of lace , inimitably delicate , exquisite in pattern , and of a bluish hue that at once contrasts and harmonises with the warm pigment of the native skin . It would be hard to find a woman more becomingly adorned than “ a well-tattooed ” Marquesan .</p>
     <p>{ 2f } “ The horror of night . ” The Polynesian fear of ghosts and of the dark has been already referred to . Their life is beleaguered by the dead .</p>
     <p>{ 2g } “ The quiet passage of souls . ” So , I am told , the natives explain the sound of a little wind passing overhead unfelt .</p>
     <p>{ 2h } “ The first of the victims fell . ” Without doubt , this whole scene is untrue to fact . The victims were disposed of privately and some time before . And indeed I am far from claiming the credit of any high degree of accuracy for this ballad . Even in a time of famine , it is probable that Marquesan life went far more gaily than is here represented . But the melancholy of to - day lies on the writer 's mind .</p>

      <head>NOTES TO TICONDEROGA</head>
      <head>INTRODUCTION .— I first heard this legend of my own country from that friend of men of letters , Mr. Alfred Nutt , “ there in roaring London 's central stream , ” and since the ballad first saw the light of day in Scribner 's Magazine , Mr. Nutt and Lord Archibald Campbell have been in public controversy on the facts . Two clans , the Camerons and the Campbells , lay claim to this bracing story ; and they do well : the man who preferred his plighted troth to the commands and menaces of the dead is an ancestor worth disputing . But the Campbells must rest content : they have the broad lands and the broad page of history ; this appanage must be denied them ; for between the name of Cameron and that of Campbell , the muse will never hesitate .</head>

     <p>NOTE TO HEATHER ALE</p>
     <p>Among the curiosities of human nature , this legend claims a high place . It is needless to remind the reader that the Picts were never exterminated , and form to this day a large proportion of the folk of Scotland : occupying the eastern and the central parts , from the Firth of Forth , or perhaps the Lammermoors , upon the south , to the Ord of Caithness on the north . That the blundering guess of a dull chronicler should have inspired men with imaginary loathing for their own ancestors is already strange : that it should have begotten this wild legend seems incredible . Is it possible the chronicler 's error was merely nominal ? that what he told , and what the people proved themselves so ready to receive , about the Picts , was true or partly true of some anterior and perhaps Lappish savages , small of stature , black of hue , dwelling underground — possibly also the distillers of some forgotten spirit ? See Mr. Campbell 's Tales of the West Highlands .</p>

       <l n="1">The sheets were frozen hard , and they cut the naked hand ;</l>
       <l n="2">The decks were like a slide , where a seaman scarce could stand ;</l>
       <l n="3">The wind was a nor'wester , blowing squally off the sea ;</l>
       <l n="4">And cliffs and spouting breakers were the only things a-lee .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">They heard the surf a-roaring before the break of day ;</l>
       <l n="6">But ‘ twas only with the peep of light we saw how ill we lay .</l>
       <l n="7">We tumbled every hand on deck instanter , with a shout ,</l>
       <l n="8">And we gave her the maintops'l , and stood by to go about .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">All day we tacked and tacked between the South Head and the North ;</l>
       <l n="10">All day we hauled the frozen sheets , and got no further forth ;</l>
       <l n="11">All day as cold as charity , in bitter pain and dread ,</l>
       <l n="12">For very life and nature we tacked from head to head .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">We gave the South a wider berth , for there the tide-race roared ;</l>
       <l n="14">But every tack we made we brought the North Head close aboard :</l>
       <l n="15">So 's we saw the cliffs and houses , and the breakers running high ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the coastguard in his garden , with his glass against his eye .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">The frost was on the village roofs as white as ocean foam ;</l>
       <l n="18">The good red fires were burning bright in every ‘ longshore home ;</l>
       <l n="19">The windows sparkled clear , and the chimneys volleyed out ;</l>
       <l n="20">And I vow we sniffed the victuals as the vessel went about .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">The bells upon the church were rung with a mighty jovial cheer ;</l>
       <l n="22">For it 's just that I should tell you how ( of all days in the year )</l>
       <l n="23">This day of our adversity was blessed Christmas morn ,</l>
       <l n="24">And the house above the coastguard 's was the house where I was born .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">O well I saw the pleasant room , the pleasant faces there ,</l>
       <l n="26">My mother 's silver spectacles , my father 's silver hair ;</l>
       <l n="27">And well I saw the firelight , like a flight of homely elves ,</l>
       <l n="28">Go dancing round the china-plates that stand upon the shelves .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">And well I knew the talk they had , the talk that was of me ,</l>
       <l n="30">Of the shadow on the household and the son that went to sea ;</l>
       <l n="31">And O the wicked fool I seemed , in every kind of way ,</l>
       <l n="32">To be here and hauling frozen ropes on blessed Christmas Day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">They lit the high sea-light , and the dark began to fall .</l>

       <l n="37">She staggered to her bearings , but the sails were new and good ,</l>
       <l n="38">And the ship smelt up to windward just as though she understood .</l>
       <l n="39">As the winter 's day was ending , in the entry of the night ,</l>
       <l n="40">We cleared the weary headland , and passed below the light .</l>

       <l n="41">And they heaved a mighty breath , every soul on board but me ,</l>
