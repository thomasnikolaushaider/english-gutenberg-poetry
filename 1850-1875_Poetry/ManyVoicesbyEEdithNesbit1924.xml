    <head>POEM : THE RETURN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The grass was gray with the moonlit dew ,</l>
     <l n="2">The stones were white as I came through ;</l>
     <l n="3">I came down the path by the thirteen yews ,</l>
     <l n="4">Through the blocks of shade that the moonlight hews .</l>
     <l n="5">And when I came to the high lych-gate</l>
     <l n="6">I waited awhile where the corpses wait ;</l>
     <l n="7">Then I came down the road where the moonlight lay</l>
     <l n="8">Like the fallen ghost of the light of day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The bats shrieked high in their zigzag flight ,</l>
     <l n="10">The owls ’ spread wings were quiet and white ,</l>
     <l n="11">The wind and the poplar gave sigh for sigh ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all about were the rustling shy</l>
     <l n="13">Little live creatures that love the night -</l>
     <l n="14">Little wild creatures timid and free .</l>
     <l n="15">I passed , and they were not afraid of me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">It was over the meadow and down the lane</l>
     <l n="17">The way to come to my house again :</l>
     <l n="18">Through the wood where the lovers talk ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the ghosts , they say , get leave to walk .</l>
     <l n="20">I wore the clothes that we all must wear ,</l>
     <l n="21">And no one saw me walking there ,</l>
     <l n="22">No one saw my pale feet pass</l>
     <l n="23">By my garden path to my garden grass .</l>
     <l n="24">My garden was hung with the veil of spring -</l>
     <l n="25">Plum-tree and pear-tree blossoming ;</l>
     <l n="26">It lay in the moon 's cold sheet of light</l>
     <l n="27">In garlands and silence , wondrous and white</l>
     <l n="28">As a dead bride decked for her burying .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">Then I saw the face of my house</l>
     <l n="30">Held close in the arms of the blossomed boughs :</l>
     <l n="31">I leaned my face to the window bright</l>
     <l n="32">To feel if the heart of my house beat right .</l>
     <l n="33">The firelight hung it with fitful gold ;</l>
     <l n="34">It was warm as the house of the dead is cold .</l>
     <l n="35">I saw the settles , the candles tall ,</l>
     <l n="36">The black-faced presses against the wall ,</l>
     <l n="37">Polished beechwood and shining brass ,</l>
     <l n="38">The gleam of china , the glitter of glass ,</l>
     <l n="39">All the little things that were home to me -</l>
     <l n="40">Everything as it used to be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">Then I said , “ The fire of life still burns ,</l>
     <l n="42">And I have returned whence none returns :</l>
     <l n="43">I will warm my hands where the fire is lit ,</l>
     <l n="44">I will warm my heart in the heart of it ! ”</l>
     <l n="45">So I called aloud to the one within :</l>
     <l n="46">“ Open , open , and let me in !</l>
     <l n="47">Let me in to the fire and the light -</l>
     <l n="48">It is very cold out here in the night ! ”</l>
     <l n="49">There was never a stir or an answering breath -</l>
     <l n="50">Only a silence as deep as death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">Then I beat on the window , and called , and cried .</l>
     <l n="52">No one heard me , and none replied .</l>
     <l n="53">The golden silence lay warm and deep ,</l>
     <l n="54">And I wept as the dead , forgotten , weep ;</l>
     <l n="55">And there was no one to hear or see -</l>
     <l n="56">To comfort me , to have pity on me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">But deep in the silence something stirred -</l>
     <l n="58">Something that had not seen or heard -</l>
     <l n="59">And two drew near to the window-pane ,</l>
     <l n="60">Kissed in the moonlight and kissed again ,</l>
     <l n="61">And looked , through my face , to the moon-shroud , spread</l>
     <l n="62">Over the garlanded garden bed ;</l>
     <l n="63">And — “ How ghostly the moonlight is ! ” she said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">Back through the garden , the wood , the lane ,</l>
     <l n="65">I came to mine own place again .</l>
     <l n="66">I wore the garments we all must wear ,</l>
     <l n="67">And no one saw me walking there .</l>
     <l n="68">No one heard my thin feet pass</l>
     <l n="69">Through the white of the stones and the gray of the grass ,</l>
     <l n="70">Along the path where the moonlight hews</l>
     <l n="71">Slabs of shadow for thirteen yews .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="72">In the hollow where drifted dreams lie deep</l>
     <l n="73">It is good to sleep : it was good to sleep :</l>
     <l n="74">But my bed has grown cold with the drip of the dew ,</l>
     <l n="75">And I cannot sleep as I used to do .</l>

     <l n="1">You see the fairies dancing in the fountain ,</l>
     <l n="2">Laughing , leaping , sparkling with the spray ;</l>
     <l n="3">You see the gnomes , at work beneath the mountain ,</l>
     <l n="4">Make gold and silver and diamonds every day ;</l>
     <l n="5">You see the angels , sliding down the moonbeams ,</l>
     <l n="6">Bring white dreams like sheaves of lilies fair ;</l>
     <l n="7">You see the imps , scarce seen against the moonbeams ,</l>
     <l n="8">Rise from the bonfire 's blue and liquid air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">All the enchantment , all the magic there is</l>

     <l n="12">Every flower that blows is a miracle for you .</l>
     <l n="13">Air , earth , water , fire , spread their splendid wares for you .</l>

     <l n="17">Soon , soon enough the magic lights grow dimmer ,</l>
     <l n="18">Marsh mists arise to cloud the radiant sky ,</l>
     <l n="19">Dust of hard highways will veil the starry glimmer ,</l>
     <l n="20">Tired hands will lay the folded magic by .</l>
     <l n="21">Storm winds will blow through those enchanted closes ,</l>
     <l n="22">Fairies be crushed where weed and briar grow strong . . .</l>
     <l n="23">Leave her her crown of magic stars and roses ,</l>

     <l n="1">In the great green park with the wooden palings -</l>

     <l n="3">There are fern and foxglove , primrose and violet ,</l>
     <l n="4">And green things growing all the time ;</l>
     <l n="5">And out in the open the daisies grow ,</l>
     <l n="6">Pretty and proud in their proper places ,</l>
     <l n="7">Millions of white-frilled daisy faces ,</l>
     <l n="8">Millions and millions — not one or two .</l>
     <l n="9">And they call to the bluebells down in the wood :</l>
     <l n="10">“ Are you out — are you in ? We have been so good</l>

     <l n="15">In the gritty garden inside the railings ,</l>
     <l n="16">The spiky railings all painted green ,</l>
     <l n="17">There are neat little beds of geraniums and fuchsia</l>
     <l n="18">With never a happy weed between .</l>
     <l n="19">There 's a neat little grass plot , bald in places ,</l>
     <l n="20">And very dusty to touch ;</l>
     <l n="21">A respectable man comes once a week</l>
     <l n="22">To keep the garden weeded and swept ,</l>
     <l n="23">To keep it as we do n't want it kept .</l>
     <l n="24">He cuts the grass with his mowing-machine ,</l>
     <l n="25">And we think he cuts it too much .</l>
     <l n="26">But even on the lawn , all dry and gritty ,</l>
     <l n="27">The daisies play about .</l>
     <l n="28">They are so brave as well as so pretty ,</l>
     <l n="29">You cannot keep them out .</l>
     <l n="30">I love them , I want to let them grow ,</l>
     <l n="31">But that respectable man says no .</l>
     <l n="32">He cuts off their heads with his mowing-machine</l>
     <l n="33">Like the French Revolution guillotine .</l>
     <l n="34">He sweeps up the poor little pretty faces ,</l>
     <l n="35">The dear little white-frilled daisy faces ;</l>
     <l n="36">Says things must be kept in their proper places</l>
     <l n="37">He has no frill round his ugly face -</l>

     <l n="1">There was a garden , very strange and fair</l>
     <l n="2">With all the roses summer never brings .</l>
     <l n="3">The snowy blossom of immortal Springs</l>
     <l n="4">Lighted its boughs , and I , even I , was there .</l>
     <l n="5">There were new heavens , and the earth was new ,</l>

     <l n="7">But when the sun stood still , and Time went out</l>
     <l n="8">Like a blown candle — when she came to me</l>
     <l n="9">Under the bride-veil of the blossomed tree ,</l>
     <l n="10">Chill through the garden blew the winds of doubt ,</l>
     <l n="11">And when , with starry eyes , and lips too near ,</l>

     <l n="16">It is our island ; do not be afraid ! ”</l>
     <l n="17">Then , then at last my heart was well deceived ;</l>

     <l n="19">Her real presence sanctified my faith ,</l>

     <l n="22">But when she said “ I love you ! ” it was Death .</l>
     <l n="23">That , that at least could neither be nor seem -</l>

     <l n="64">To bring their boastings to naught -</l>
     <l n="65">Gabriel with trumpet of battle . . .</l>

     <l n="69">See , Lord , this is his body ,</l>
     <l n="70">Broken for Thee , for Thee . . .</l>
     <l n="71">My son , my little son ,</l>
     <l n="72">Who leapt and laughed on my knee .</l>

    <head>POEM : “ INASMUCH AS YE DID IT NOT . . . "</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">If Jesus came to London ,</l>
     <l n="2">Came to London to-day ,</l>
     <l n="3">He would not go to the West End ,</l>
     <l n="4">He would come down our way ;</l>
     <l n="5">He 'd talk with the children dancing</l>
     <l n="6">To the organ out in the street ,</l>
     <l n="7">And say he was their big Brother ,</l>
     <l n="8">And give them something to eat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">He would n't go to the mansions</l>
     <l n="10">Where the charitable live ;</l>
     <l n="11">He 'd come to the tenement houses</l>
     <l n="12">Where we ai n't got nothing to give .</l>
     <l n="13">He 'd come so kind and so homely ,</l>
     <l n="14">And treat us to beer and bread ,</l>
     <l n="15">And tell us how we ought to behave ;</l>
     <l n="16">And we 'd try to mind what He said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">In the warm bright West End churches</l>
     <l n="18">They sing and preach and pray ,</l>
     <l n="19">They call us “ Beloved brethren , ”</l>
     <l n="20">But they do not act that way .</l>
     <l n="21">And when He came to the church door</l>
     <l n="22">He 'd call out loud and free ,</l>
     <l n="23">You stop that preaching and praying</l>
     <l n="24">And show what you 've done for Me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Then they 'd say , “ O Lord , we have given</l>
     <l n="26">To the poor both blankets and tracts ,</l>
     <l n="27">And we 've tried to make them sober ,</l>
     <l n="28">And we 've tried to teach them facts .</l>
     <l n="29">But they will sneak round to the drink-shop ,</l>
     <l n="30">And pawn the blankets for beer ,</l>
     <l n="31">And we find them very ungrateful ,</l>
     <l n="32">But still we persevere . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Then He would say , “ I told you</l>
     <l n="34">The time I was here before ,</l>
     <l n="35">That you were all of you brothers ,</l>
     <l n="36">All you that I suffered for .</l>
     <l n="37">I wo n't go into your churches ,</l>
     <l n="38">I 'll stop in the sun outside .</l>
     <l n="39">You bring out the men your brothers ,</l>
     <l n="40">The men for whom I died ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Out of our beastly lodgings ,</l>
     <l n="42">From arches and doorways about ,</l>
     <l n="43">They 'd have to do as He told them ,</l>
     <l n="44">They 'd have to call us out .</l>
     <l n="45">Millions and millions and millions ,</l>
     <l n="46">Thick and crawling like flies ,</l>
     <l n="47">We should creep out to the sunshine</l>
     <l n="48">And not be afraid of His eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">He 'd see what God 's image looks like</l>
     <l n="50">When men have dealt with the same ,</l>
     <l n="51">Wrinkled with work that is never done ,</l>
     <l n="52">Swollen and dirty with shame .</l>
     <l n="53">He 'd see on the children 's forehead</l>
     <l n="54">The branded gutter-sign</l>
     <l n="55">That marks the girls to be harlots ,</l>
     <l n="56">That dooms the boys to be swine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">Then He 'd say , “ What 's the good of churches</l>
     <l n="58">When these have nowhere to sleep ?</l>
     <l n="59">And how can I hear you praying</l>
     <l n="60">When they are cursing so deep ?</l>
     <l n="61">I gave My Blood and My Body</l>
     <l n="62">That they might have bread and wine ,</l>
     <l n="63">And you have taken your share and theirs</l>
     <l n="64">Of these good gifts of mine ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">Then some of the rich would be sorry ,</l>
     <l n="66">And all would be very scared ,</l>
     <l n="67">And they 'd say , “ But we never knew , Lord ! ”</l>
     <l n="68">And He 'd say , “ You never cared ! ”</l>
     <l n="69">And some would be sick and shameful</l>
     <l n="70">Because they 'd know that they knew ,</l>
     <l n="71">And the best would say , “ We were wrong , Lord .</l>
     <l n="72">Now tell us what to do ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">I think He 'd be sitting , likely ,</l>
     <l n="74">For someone ‘ ud bring Him a chair ,</l>
     <l n="75">With a common kid cuddled up on His knee</l>
     <l n="76">And the common sun on His hair ;</l>
     <l n="77">And they 'd be standing before Him ,</l>
     <l n="78">And He 'd say , “ You know that you knew .</l>
     <l n="79">Why have n't you worked for your brothers</l>
     <l n="80">The same as I worked for you ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="81">“ For since you 're all of you brothers</l>
     <l n="82">It 's clear as God 's blessed sun</l>
     <l n="83">That each must work for the others ,</l>
     <l n="84">Not thousands work for one .</l>
     <l n="85">And the ones that have lived bone-idle</l>
     <l n="86">If they want Me to hear them pray ,</l>
     <l n="87">Let them go and work for their livings</l>
     <l n="88">The only honest way !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="89">“ I 've got nothing new to tell you ,</l>
     <l n="90">You know what I always said -</l>
     <l n="91">But you 've built their bones into churches</l>
     <l n="92">And stolen their wine and bread ;</l>
     <l n="93">You with My Name on your foreheads ,</l>
     <l n="94">Liar , and traitor , and knave ,</l>
     <l n="95">You have lived by the death of your brothers ,</l>
     <l n="96">These whom I died to save ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="97">I wish He would come and say it ;</l>
     <l n="98">Perhaps they 'd believe it then ,</l>
     <l n="99">And work like men for their livings</l>
     <l n="100">And let us work like men .</l>
     <l n="101">Brothers ? They do n't believe it ,</l>
     <l n="102">The lie on their lips is red .</l>
     <l n="103">They 'll never believe till He comes again ,</l>
     <l n="104">Or till we rise from the dead !</l>
