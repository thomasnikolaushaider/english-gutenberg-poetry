   <head>THE MAGIC WINDOWS</head>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>I</head>
    <head>Did you ever hear of the Magic Windows ? Those who look through them behold many strange and beautiful sights . If you will but make them your own , you may enter the fairyland of wonder and see all its rich treasures .</head>
     <l n="1">You ask me how you can do this ? I will answer by telling you a story .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There was once a happy boy who played through the long summer days . And where he played the meadows were green , and the sky was blue , and the sunshine was bright .</p>
   <p>On every side the flowers nodded like smiling playmates . Birds chirped to him from the bushes . The rabbits gave him a friendly look as they went leaping by . The squirrels watched him with bright eyes as they ran up and down the trees .</p>
   <p>A little brook flowed through the meadows . On its sandy bed the happy boy found bright pebbles . His toy ships sailed proudly upon its waves or rested in the quiet harbors along its banks . Tiny fishes darted from their hiding places to eat the crumbs which he threw into the water .</p>
   <p>“ I wonder where the brook goes , ” said the happy boy . “ I should like to follow it and see . How I wish the school bell would never call me from my play ! I would rather sail my boat than learn to read , and I like the rabbits and squirrels better than my books . ”</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The little brook heard the boy 's words as it went flowing by . On its way to the great river it ran through a forest where fairyland was hidden . There it told the fairies of the happy boy and of his wishes .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By and by the sun went down and playtime ended . Night came , and the</l>
     <l n="2">Shut-eye train carried the boy far away to the Land of Slumber .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">There a wise fairy met the happy boy . “ Come with me , ” she said , “ and I</l>
     <l n="4">will let you look through Magic Windows into a land of wonders . ”</l>

   <p>Through the Magic Windows the boy looked with delight . All the things that he had ever wished to see were before him . There were the hiding places of the wild birds . There were the animals that live in the fields and in the woods .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>He could look into the birds ’ nests that hung on the tallest trees . He could peep into the holes where the squirrels kept their little ones .</p>
   <p>He could see the mole digging long halls under ground . He could watch the spider as it spun the silk for its curious house .</p>
   <p>Rabbits were hiding their young in the long grass , and little foxes were playing by their rocky dens .</p>
   <p>He could even see the bear 's cubs curled up like balls in the hollow trunks of trees .</p>

     <l n="3">“ Look to the north , ” said the fairy .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And then the happy boy looked away over the great round world . He saw strange lands and strange people . Far off in the north he could see the land of snow and ice . There were the homes of the seal , the reindeer , and the white bear .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Children dressed in fur crept out of snow houses . They went dashing over the snow in sleds drawn by dogs .</p>
   <p>Again the happy boy looked , and the wonder lands of the south lay before him . Gay flowers blossomed everywhere . Bright-colored birds found a safe home in the great forest .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>He could see the lion and his mate in their home . Hundreds of monkeys played in the branches of the trees . Tigers ran through the tall grass , and huge elephants pushed their way among the trees and bushes .</p>
   <p>Once more the happy boy looked through the Magic Windows , and oh , how wonderful ! He could see into fairy land where animals talk , and where the playthings are alive .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , kind fairy , let me stay here , ” said the happy boy . “ I can not leave this land of wonders . ”</p>
   <p>“ Would you like to have the Magic Windows for your own ? ” asked the fairy . “ Then listen well . When the school bell rings , it will call you to the land of books . Through the Magic Windows of your books you may see greater wonders than fairies can tell or fairy land can show . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Another day came with the rising sun . Once more the school bell rang .</l>
     <l n="2">Gladly the happy boy left his play , for in his books he would find the</l>

    <p>A WONDERFUL BALL</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">

     <l n="12">level islands feathery dreary</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">I have heard of a wonderful ball which floats in the sweet blue air ,</l>
     <l n="14">and has soft white clouds about it as it floats along .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="15">There are many charming stories to be told about this wonderful ball .</l>
     <l n="16">Some of them you shall hear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="17">It is so large that many houses are built upon it . Men and women live</l>
     <l n="18">upon it , and little children can play upon its surface .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In some places it is soft and green , like the long meadows between the hills . In other parts there are trees for miles and miles on every side . All kinds of wild animals live in the great forests that grow on this wonderful ball .</p>
   <p>Then again in some places it is steep and rough . And there are mountains so high that the snow lies upon their tops all the year around .</p>
   <p>In other parts there are no hills at all , but level land , and quiet little ponds of blue water . There the white water lilies grow and fishes play among the lily stems .</p>
   <p>Now , if we look on another side of the ball , we shall see no ponds , but something very dreary . A great plain of sand stretches away on every side . There are no trees , and the sunshine beats down upon the burning sand .</p>
   <p>We look again , and we see a great body of water . Many islands are in the sea , and great ships sail upon it .</p>
   <p>Look at one more side of this ball as it turns around . Jack Frost must have spent all his longest winter nights here . For see what a palace of ice he has built for himself .</p>
   <p>How cold it looks ! See the clear , blue ice , almost as blue as the sky . And look at the snow , drifts upon drifts , and the feathery flakes filling the air .</p>
   <p>Now , what do you think of this ball , so white and cold , so warm and green , so dreary and rough , as it floats along in the sweet blue air , with the flocks of white clouds about it ?</p>
   <p>I will tell you one thing more . The wise men have said that this earth on which we live is just such a ball . We shall know more about this when we are older and wiser .</p>
   <p>THE GREAT , WIDE WORLD</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Great , wide , beautiful , wonderful world ,</l>
     <l n="2">With the wonderful water round you curled ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the wonderful grass upon your breast —</l>
     <l n="4">World , you are beautifully dressed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The wonderful air is over me ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree ;</l>
     <l n="7">It walks on the water , and whirls the mills ,</l>
     <l n="8">And talks to itself on the tops of the hills .</l>

   <p>You friendly earth , how far do you go , With the wheat fields that nod and the rivers that flow , With cities and gardens , and cliffs and isles , And people upon you for thousands of miles ? — WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS .</p>
   <p>FLOWERS THAT TELL TIME</p>
   <p>sign remained refreshing curls jolly nightgown clambered porch</p>
   <p>Down in the grass plot of a pretty garden grew a little dandelion . He wore a green jacket , and his head was covered with sunny , yellow curls .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>In the morning , he stood up boldly , lifting his jolly little face to catch the dewdrops . In this way he took his morning bath , and he found it very refreshing . At dusk he put on his green nightgown and went to bed very early .</p>
   <p>The mothers said , as they called the children from their play , “ See , there is the good dandelion ! He knows when it is time to go to bed . ”</p>
   <p>As the dandelion grew older , his yellow curls turned white . Then the children would blow — one , two , three times . If all the hairs blew away , it was a sign that mother wanted them at once .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>If there were ten hairs left , the children said , “ Mother wants us at ten o'clock . ” If but two hairs remained , they said , “ Mother will look for us at two o'clock . ”</p>
   <p>When the children awoke in the morning , they saw the morning-glory cups peeping in at the windows . “ Six o'clock ! Time to get up ! ” they said . “ The morning glories are calling us . ”</p>
   <p>Every afternoon the four-o'clocks bloomed . Their red and white flowers told the children that their father would soon be home .</p>
   <p>In the evening the moon flowers unfolded their great white blossoms on the vines that clambered over the porch . “ Now it is bedtime , ” said the children , “ for the moon flowers are looking down at us . ”</p>
   <p>All day long the time flowers , like our clocks , are telling us the time of day .</p>

   <p>THE FARMER 'S WHEAT FIELD</p>
   <p>stalk threshed breeze flour plump healthy bearded grain forth neighbor thousand cheer</p>
   <p>There was once a stalk of wheat that grew in the middle of a field . It was very tall and it lifted its head high and nodded in the wind .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>All around it were a thousand other stalks not quite so tall . Every one was looking up at the sun and bowing to its neighbor , and saying , “ Good morning . ”</p>
   <p>“ How bright and golden we are ! ” said the tall stalk ; “ and how beautiful we look , standing together like a great army of soldiers ! The sun shines to cheer us . And when the gentle rains fall , how sweet and refreshing they are ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , yes ! ” said the other stalks , waving back and forth in the morning breeze . “ All the world is very kind to us . We have nothing to do but to live and grow and become bright and golden like the sun . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ah , ” said the tall stalk . “ It is true that we must live and grow and become yellow and golden . But after that , there must be something else for us to do . ”</p>
   <p>The very next day the farmer came into the fields to look at his wheat . He took some of the bearded heads and rubbed them between his hands . They were full of plump , round , golden grains .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ What fine flour these will make , and what good bread for little</l>
     <l n="2">Alice , ” he said . “ The wheat is fully ripe and it must be cut at once . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Then all the golden-headed stalks waved back and forth in the wind . “ Now we understand it all , ” they whispered . “ It is for the sake of the farmer 's fair little girl that we are here .</p>
   <p>“ She must live and grow and be healthy and beautiful . There is nothing that can help her to do this so well as good bread made from the best of wheat . ”</p>
   <p>Very soon the golden stalks were cut . The wheat was threshed and ground into the finest of flour . And then the flour was baked into fresh , white loaves of bread .</p>
   <p>But little Alice did not know that her bread was made of the wheat that she had seen growing in the big field where the daisies bloomed .</p>

   <p>It was a friendly old tree . Under its branches men and animals found pleasant shade . In the spring it gave blossoms to all that came , and in the fall it dropped apples at their feet .</p>
   <p>The apple tree was easy to climb , as Dick well knew . From its top he could see the sloping hillside and the little brook that flowed through the pasture . Indeed , he spent so much time playing in the old tree that his father often said , “ Well , Dick , has the Apple-Tree Mother kept you out of mischief to-day ? ”</p>
   <p>And so Dick came to wonder a great deal about the Apple-Tree Mother .</p>
   <p>The time of green apples had come , and all day long a hard wind had been blowing . When supper time came Dick was ill. Perhaps the apple tree could have told the reason .</p>
   <p>Dick was lying on the couch , and his mother was busy making a cup of tea for him .</p>
   <p>After he had taken the hot and bitter drink he lay watching the steam that rose from the teakettle . Just as he was closing his eyes in sleep the steam began to turn from white to green . Then an apple tree grew up out of the teakettle and stretched its branches to the ceiling .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ That looks like the apple tree in the corner of our pasture , ” thought</l>
     <l n="2">Dick .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And then he saw a woman sitting in the midst of the branches . She wore a</l>
     <l n="4">dress that was green and brown , like the apple-tree leaves in the fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ I suppose that is the Apple-Tree Mother , ” said Dick to himself . “ If</l>
     <l n="6">she is as old as our tree , she must be very old indeed . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Then the Apple-Tree Mother laughed and all the leaves of the tree danced . “ My little boy , ” she said , “ I am so old that I have grown young again , and I bring with me pictures and stories of the world that has lived about my tree . ”</p>
   <p>“ Pictures and stories ! ” exclaimed Dick . “ Oh , can n't you show me some of them ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That is just why I came to visit you , ” she said . “ Will you have pictures of animals or of flowers ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I would like to see pictures of animals first , ” said Dick .</p>

   <p>Then the room changed to the corner of the pasture . There was the fence and the brook and the old apple tree . Just above the fence , half hidden in the branches , was a nest that held five tiny eggs .</p>
   <p>The sound of bird voices was heard , and there in the tree Dick saw two orioles . They were singing a song together , and somehow Dick could understand it all . They sang of their little home and of the eggs that lay within it . And they sang of the happy time when five little birds would come to be loved and cared for .</p>

   <p>Then the two orioles rose slowly into the air and flew across the field . The nest was left alone .</p>
   <p>Down the road came a boy whistling and kicking up the dust with every step .</p>
   <p>Dick began to feel very unhappy , for he knew just what would happen next .</p>
   <p>The boy in the picture looked up and saw the brown nest among the leaves . “ There is an oriole 's nest , ” thought he . And in a moment he had climbed the tree , and the five tiny eggs were in his hand .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I 'll take them home , ” he said , as he put the eggs into his pocket .</l>

     <l n="3">With an angry word he threw all the eggs on the ground , and then went</l>

   <p>A joyous bird song was heard in the air , and the two orioles darted into the apple tree . The mother bird flew to her nest . Then she gave a cry so sharp and sad that it hurt one 's heart to hear it .</p>
   <p>The father bird joined the poor mother in her outcries of fright and sorrow . There on the dusty ground lay all that was left of the beautiful eggs .</p>
   <p>Far across the field flew the oriole mother , almost wild with sorrow . The father , with his feathers drooping , sat on a fence post , and his happy songs were changed to notes of sadness .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Dick was afraid to say “ No . ” He lay quite still , looking at the apple tree . The rain was beginning to beat against the leaves . Then he saw a weary little dog come limping to the tree , whining , and licking one of his paws .</p>
   <p>He was not a handsome dog . His legs were crooked and one ear was torn . The branches of the tree bent above him . And when the poor dog looked up at their shelter , one could see how big and soft and sad were his eyes .</p>
   <p>With a splashing noise two boys came wading across the brook . Each boy had a fishing pole over his shoulder , and in his hand was a small tin pail in which he had carried bait .</p>
   <p>As they came toward the tree one of them pointed to the poor little dog . It was the same boy that had stolen the oriole 's eggs .</p>

   </figure>
   <p>“ Now for some fun ! ” he said . Then both the boys sat down on the ground , and to work they went with a fishing line and one of the empty pails .</p>
   <p>They did not see how the apple tree shook its head at them . They did not hear how each raindrop called , “ No ! no ! no ! ” as it fell pattering on the leaves .</p>
   <p>The poor little dog lay resting under the tree , safe from the storm . All at once he was caught and held by rough hands . He howled with fright and pain , but he could not get away . A strong cord was bound around his thin little body , and his wounded foot was sadly hurt .</p>
   <p>At last the boys let him go , and with a wild bound he jumped through the fence and ran along the road .</p>
   <p>But oh , what terrible thing is rattling and banging around him ? At every leap he is cruelly struck on his crooked little legs .</p>
   <p>Dick had turned his head the other way . His cheeks burned and his heart was sad . Then he opened his eyes and saw his mother standing beside him with a second cup of bitter tea in her hand .</p>
   <p>“ Such a nice sleep as you have had , ” she said . “ I really think you are better . Now sit up and drink this like a man . ”</p>
   <p>Never a word said Dick . He sat up and drank the bitter tea , while he thought of many things . Had he seen himself in the pictures which the Apple-Tree Mother had brought to his bedside ?</p>

   <p>THE DIAMOND DIPPER</p>

    <head>rusty narrow further fern dipper towered suffering brim dying withered carefully spill</head>
    <head>Once upon a time it was very hot and very , very dry . No rain had fallen for days and days . The thirsty birds had stopped singing . The plants withered and the animals were dying for want of water . All the people were praying for rain .</head>
     <l n="1">One morning a little girl started out to find some water for her sick</l>
     <l n="2">mother . In her hand she carried a tin dipper .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She climbed a high hill hoping to find a spring . Up and up she climbed . On her way she saw the dusty plants , the quiet birds , and the suffering animals .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The sharp stones cut her feet . High rocks towered above her head . Their strange shapes filled her with fear . But she thought of her sick mother and she would not turn back . At last she came to a great wall of rocks , and could go no farther .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , that some good fairy would show me where to find water ! ” she cried .</p>
   <p>And then a beautiful fairy stood before her in a robe like the clouds at sunset . She pointed to a narrow path among the rocks . The child followed the path and soon came to a spring hidden under green fern leaves .</p>
   <p>She filled her dipper to the brim . How carefully she held it ! How softly she stepped , so as not to spill one drop !</p>
   <p>In her path down the hill there lay a rabbit almost dead from thirst . The little girl needed all the water , but she poured a few drops upon the rabbit 's tongue . Then something wonderful happened ! The rusty tin dipper was changed to shining silver .</p>

   <p>The little girl hurried home . With a happy heart she gave the water to her sick mother . The gentle mother raised the dipper to her lips , but she did not drink . “ My faithful nurse , let her drink first , ” she said .</p>
   <p>As she gave the silver dipper to the nurse , behold ! it was changed to yellow gold .</p>
   <p>Again the mother raised the water to her lips . Just then a shadow fell across the floor . In the open doorway stood an old woman . She was ragged and pale and weak . She could only stretch out her thin hand toward the water .</p>
   <p>The mother and the little girl looked at each other . Could they give up the last drop of the precious water ? The mother nodded her head , and the little girl put the golden dipper into the hands of the stranger .</p>
   <p>The poor old woman took the water and drank it all . As she drank , her rags were changed into beautiful garments , and the dipper sparkled with diamonds .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , mother , look ! There is the fairy I saw in the mountains , ” cried the little girl . “ And see ! The dipper shines like diamonds ! ”</p>
   <p>They looked again , but the fairy was gone . It was not long before clouds spread over the sky , and a gentle rain began to fall . Soon there was water for all the plants , the birds , the animals , and the people .</p>
   <p>But the dipper could not anywhere be found . Night came , and the little girl looked up at the stars . There , in the sky , she saw the dipper shining like diamonds .</p>
   <p>And now , when the evening stars twinkle overhead , the mothers point out the great dipper in the northern sky and tell this story to their children .</p>
   <p>“ Is the story true ? ” the children ask when the tale is ended .</p>
   <p>And the mothers smile as they answer :—</p>

   <p>Did you ever take a feather in your hand and look at it ? Did you notice how the quill keeps the feather in shape and makes it strong ?</p>

   <p>Now find the leaf of an apple tree . Hold it before your eyes and let the light shine through it .</p>
   <p>Do you see the large rib running along the middle of the leaf ? Do you see the fine ribs on each side of the large rib ? Does not the large rib make you think of the quill of a feather ?</p>
   <p>The ribs of a leaf have fine passages or pipes in them through which the sap flows . These passages are called veins , and the large rib is called a midvein . When a leaf has one strong midvein like the quill of a feather , it is said to be feather-veined .</p>
   <p>Let us go out of doors and find leaves that are shaped like feathers .</p>
   <p>There is a peach tree . Pick a leaf and look at it . Yes , the peach leaf is feather-veined . Now go to the pear tree . “ These leaves look like the apple leaves , ” you say .</p>
   <p>Here is a dandelion plant growing in the grass . Take a leaf in your hand and look at its ragged edges . There is one straight rib or vein along the middle of the leaf . And so you see that the dandelion leaf is also feather-veined .</p>

   <p>You can find feather-veined leaves on the plants in the garden and on the flower stems that grow in our window boxes . And you can also find feather-veined leaves on the weeds that grow by the side of the road .</p>
   <p>Look again at the apple leaf . Do you see the fine network of veins ? Now take up a leaf of grass and hold it in the light . Can you see a network of veins in it ? No , the grass leaf has straight veins .</p>
   <p>All the grass blades are long and narrow . Have you ever seen any other leaves that were long and narrow like the grass ?</p>

   <p>But what is this leaf under the maple tree ? “ It is a maple leaf , ” you say . This leaf is not shaped like a feather .</p>
   <p>Hold out your hand and stretch out your fingers . Does not the maple leaf look as if it had fingers , too ? We may call the maple leaf a hand-shaped leaf . Perhaps we can find more hand-shaped leaves . Let us go to the currant bushes . Yes , these also have hand-shaped leaves .</p>
   <p>One of the strangest leaves in the world is shaped like a pitcher . It has a lid that opens and shuts . Some leaves of this kind hold more than a cup of water .</p>
   <p>There are leaves shaped like hearts and leaves shaped like arrowheads . And there are many other wonderful leaves which we may see if we keep our eyes open .</p>

   <p>DOGS THAT ALMOST TALK</p>
   <p>human scratched tinkled begged humble drowning cottage wagged</p>
   <p>It seems as if our friend the dog can talk without using words . He not only makes other dogs understand him , but he also makes his wants known to his master .</p>
   <p>A little dog named Rudy was once taken to the city . One day he lost his way in the streets and did not come home at night .</p>
   <p>The next morning , as Rudy 's master was looking out of the window , he saw his little dog coming along the street with two other dogs .</p>
   <p>The strangers left Rudy at his own door , and then went away . As they left they seemed to say , “ Good-by . ” But how did Rudy ask the other dogs to show him the way home ? This we should like to know .</p>
   <p>Another dog called Prince often asked in his own way to be let out of doors . But when he returned he could not always get into the house again .</p>
   <p>The bell was too high for Prince to reach it or he might have learned to ring it . As he could not do this he found another way to get in . A little girl who lived near by often played with him . He ran to her and begged until she saw what he wanted . This he did day after day .</p>
   <p>After the little girl had rung the bell for him , Prince never forgot to thank her . He jumped around her and wagged his tail to show his pleasure .</p>
   <p>One day Prince could not find his little friend . So he begged a man who was passing by to ring the bell . It was some time before the man could understand what the dog wanted . But at last the bell tinkled , the door was opened , and Prince ran into the house .</p>
   <p>A faithful dog never forgets those he loves . Sometimes he proves to be a good friend in time of great need .</p>
   <p>One night a fire broke out in a shed close by a little cottage . The watchdog saw the flames . He ran to the cottage and began to scratch the door with his paws . He scratched and howled until he woke the family .</p>
   <p>After the fire had been put out the children put their arms around the faithful dog . They patted him and thanked him for saving their lives . They treated him as if he were a human being instead of only a dog .</p>
   <p>There are many true stories about dogs that have saved the lives of children . A great artist has painted a beautiful picture of one of these noble animals .</p>
   <p>A dog has jumped into the sea and saved a child from drowning . He has caught the child 's clothes in his strong jaws , and has brought her to the shore .</p>
   <p>See , he is almost too tired to climb up beside her ! There she lies on his big paws . He seems to be waiting for help . Does he not look as if he could speak ?</p>

   <p>The artist who painted this picture was a great friend of dogs . His name was Edwin Landseer . He has made hundreds of paintings of his humble friends . Many of the dogs in his pictures look as if they could talk .</p>

   <p>One day Rollo and his playmate , George Cropwell , were running along the road , pushing their little wheelbarrows .</p>
   <p>Just as they came near George 's home they saw before them a little boy much smaller than Rollo . He was ragged and barefooted .</p>

   <p>“ There is Tom , ” said George . “ See how I will frighten him . ”</p>
   <p>As he said this , George rolled his wheelbarrow directly toward Tom as if he were going to run over him . Tom was very much frightened and began to scream .</p>
   <p>Just at that moment Farmer Cropwell happened to be coming up the lane on the opposite side of the road . He called out ,—</p>
   <p>“ George ! ”</p>
   <p>George stopped his wheelbarrow .</p>
   <p>“ Is that right ? ” said the farmer .</p>
   <p>“ Why , I was not going to hurt him , ” said George .</p>
   <p>“ You did hurt him ,— you frightened him . ”</p>
   <p>“ Is frightening him hurting him , father ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , yes ; it is giving pain , and a very unpleasant kind of pain , too . ”</p>
   <p>“ I did not think of that , ” said George .</p>
   <p>“ Besides , ” said his father , “ when you treat boys in that harsh , rough way you make them your enemies . And it is a very bad plan to make enemies . ”</p>
   <p>“ Enemies , father ! ” said George , laughing ; “ Tom could not do me any harm if he were my enemy . ”</p>
   <p>“ That makes me think of the story of the bear and the tomtit , ” said the farmer . “ If you and Rollo will jump into the cart I will tell it to you . ”</p>

     <l n="1">One pleasant summer morning a wolf met a bear in a lonely wood . In a</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Brother , ” said the bear , “ that is very good singing , indeed . What</l>

     <l n="8">“ Perhaps we shall see if we wait until his mate comes home , ” said the</l>
     <l n="9">wolf .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="10">Soon the mother bird came flying with some food in her mouth for her</l>
     <l n="11">children . She went to the tree where her mate was singing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="12">“ Now , I shall climb the tree , ” said the bear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="13">“ Not yet , ” said the wolf . “ Wait until the birds leave the nest . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>They walked away for some distance , but soon returned , for the bear was impatient to see the nest . He scrambled up the tree , intending to frighten the young birds .</p>
   <p>“ Take care , ” said the wolf . “ The tomtits are very little , but little enemies are sometimes very troublesome . ”</p>
   <p>“ Who is afraid of a tomtit ? ” said the bear , as he poked his black nose into the nest .</p>
   <p>“ Go away ! go away ! ” screamed the poor little birds in terror .</p>
   <p>“ What do you mean by making such a noise and talking so to me ? ” said the bear . “ I will teach you better manners . ”</p>
   <p>So he put his great paw on the nest and pressed it down until the poor little birds could hardly breathe . Then he left them and went away .</p>
   <p>The young tomtits were terribly frightened , and some of them were hurt . When the old birds came home they were very angry .</p>
   <p>They could see the bear walking about among the trees , but they did not know how to punish him .</p>

     <l n="1">Not far away there was a glen , surrounded by high rocks , where the</l>
     <l n="2">bear used to go to sleep because it was a lonely place .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>One day , as he was prowling in the woods , he saw two hunters coming with their guns . In fright , he fled to his glen , where he thought he should be safe .</p>
   <p>The tomtits saw the bear run to the rocks and hide in terror .</p>
   <p>“ Why is the bear hiding ? ” said one bird to the other .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Do you see those hunters with their guns ? ” said the mother tomtit .</l>
     <l n="2">“ If only they can find the bear , then our little ones will be safe .</l>
     <l n="3">Let us help them . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So the tomtits began to flutter around the hunters and fly a little way toward the glen and then back again . The men followed the birds to see what could be the matter .</p>
   <p>By and by the bear saw the hunters coming , led on by his little enemies , the tomtits . He ran from one side of the glen to the other . He hid himself in a cave among the rocks . But he could not escape the hunters .</p>
   <p>The wolf happened to be near by upon the rocks that overlooked the glen . Hearing the noise , he came and peeped over .</p>
   <p>As soon as he saw what had happened to the bear , he thought it would be prudent for him to walk away . This he did , saying to himself as he went :—</p>
   <p>“ Well , the bear has found out that a friend is better than an enemy , whether he is great or small . ”</p>
   <p>Here the farmer paused . He had ended his story .</p>
   <p>“ What did they do with the bear ? ” asked Rollo .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , ” said the farmer , “ they took off his skin to make caps of , and nailed his claws up on the barn . ”</p>

   <p>A dog , with a piece of meat in his mouth , was hurrying home to eat his supper in quiet . On his way he had to pass over a narrow plank which lay across a small stream .</p>
   <p>As he looked down into the water he saw his own image in the smooth surface of the brook . This , he thought , was another dog with a larger piece of meat in his mouth .</p>
   <p>He put his head down near the water . Behold , the meat , which the other dog carried , was plainly within his reach .</p>
   <p>“ Now , I shall have a fine dinner , ” he thought . And with a quick snap of his jaws , he tried to snatch the meat from the dog in the water .</p>
   <p>But as he opened his mouth , his own piece of meat fell to the bottom of the brook . And thus , by greed , he lost all that he had .</p>

   <p>The Indian boy is taught to look at things closely , and to think about everything he sees . He learns to observe . Here is a good story of an Indian who was trained to use his eyes when he was young .</p>
   <p>An old Indian once lived in a village among white people . His little hut was near the woods . A white man lived alone in a cabin near by .</p>
   <p>One night the white man came home late from his work in the fields . He had left a bag of corn hanging in his cabin . Some one had taken it .</p>
   <p>He was very angry . “ That lazy Indian who lives in the hut has stolen my corn , ” he told his neighbors .</p>
   <p>“ Send for the Indian and let him speak for himself , ” said one of the neighbors .</p>
   <p>When the Indian came he said , “ I did not take your corn . ”</p>
   <p>“ If you did not take my corn , who did ? ” asked the angry man .</p>
   <p>“ I can not tell you his name , ” the Indian answered . “ I have never seen him , but I can tell you something about him .</p>
   <p>“ Your corn was stolen by a white man . He is an old man , and he is a short man . ”</p>
   <p>One of the neighbors had seen a little old man . He was going to the woods with a bag on his back .</p>
   <p>They went out to hunt for him . Soon he was found , and the bag of corn was returned to its owner .</p>
   <p>How could the Indian tell who had taken the corn ? Every one wanted to know .</p>
   <p>“ I will tell you , ” said the Indian . “ I knew that the thief was an old man from the heavy mark of his feet in the earth . A young man 's step is much lighter .</p>
   <p>“ I knew he was a white man because he turned his toes out when he walked . An Indian does not walk in that way .</p>
   <p>“ Did you not see that he stood on a stool to reach the bag of corn ? This shows that he was a short man . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Now see , ” said the neighbors . “ If you had kept your eyes open as the</l>

   <p>One summer morning , a merry group of children was helping to make hay in one of the Clovernook hay fields .</p>
   <p>Not far away stood a little brown house in the cool shade of cherry trees and apple trees . A sweetbrier clambered over the windows , and in the dooryard grew bushes of large red roses .</p>

   </figure>
   <p>Near the house was a deep well of clear , cold water . An old-fashioned well sweep was used to draw up the water , as you see in the picture .</p>
   <p>This was the Clovernook home . Here lived the merry children who were helping in the hayfield , and there were nine of them . What if the house was small ? There was the barn in which they could play , and there were the fields and woods in which they could wander .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>“ He liked to gather his children around him . ”</p>
   </figure>
   <p>They thought their gentle , blue-eyed mother the most beautiful woman in the world . Their father was one of the kindest of men . Every child loved him , and the horses and the cows followed him all over the farm .</p>
   <p>He loved books , and went about his work repeating fine old hymns and lines from grand poems . In the long winter evenings he liked to gather his children around him before the open fire . Then he told them wonderful stories of the olden time .</p>
   <p>The Clovernook children learned to know the flowers and the trees by name , and to tell the birds by their songs . In the spring they boiled sap for maple sugar . In the fall they gathered nuts , and helped store away the apples in the cellar .</p>
   <p>There were two daughters of the Clovernook household who liked nothing so well as their books . They went to school when their mother could spare them from the work of the home . At night they often wished to study , but they had no lamp . So they put some lard into a saucer and used a piece of cloth for a wick .</p>
   <p>Year after year these two girls spent all their spare moments in reading and study . What they did when they were older , and how they came to be called the Poet Sisters , you shall soon learn .</p>

   <p>The Clovernook home was near Cincinnati , Ohio . When Alice and Phoebe grew older they left the home of their childhood and went to live in New York city .</p>
   <p>They were now able to earn money by writing stories and poems for books and papers . At last they could make their home beautiful with the books and pictures which they had so long wished for .</p>

    <p>Columbus in the New World .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>When Columbus reached the New World , he landed on a beautiful green island . He tells us that the island was covered with trees like an orchard . The trees and the flowers and the fruits were different from any that he had ever seen before .</p>
   <p>All day he remained on shore with his men . They were delighted with the warm air , the clear streams , the bright flowers , and the fresh fruit .</p>
   <p>The natives were friendly and gentle . They wore no clothes , but their bodies were painted with many colors . They came near the strangers and seemed to wonder at their white faces .</p>
   <p>Some of the natives wore rings of gold in their noses and ears . Columbus tried to learn from them where they had found the gold . They pointed to the south and said “ Cuba . ” By signs they led him to believe that Cuba was a land where there was much gold .</p>
   <p>Columbus was in haste to reach the mines of gold and the rich cities about which he had read . The next day he sailed with all his ships and sailors toward the south .</p>
   <p>They passed by many green islands as beautiful as the one on which they had landed . Columbus sat on deck , watching the shore . He hoped and he believed that he should soon see the towers of a city rise toward the sky .</p>
   <p>The news of the visit of the white men spread from island to island . The natives ran to the shore to see the wonderful ships with sails like white wings . They paddled out to the ships in their canoes , and they brought fruit and balls of cotton yarn .</p>
   <p>Columbus and his men were looking everywhere for gold . Whenever they saw a village of huts they visited the chief and asked him where gold could be found . They traded bells and beads for the gold ornaments which the natives wore .</p>
   <p>Soon Columbus reached the shores of Cuba . Everywhere he saw beautiful flowers and fruits . He found gentle natives living in poor huts . But he saw no cities and he found no mines of gold .</p>
   <p>Columbus supposed that he had reached some small islands on the coast of India . For this reason he called the dark-skinned people living there Indians . He did not know that he had found the New World .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>At last Columbus gave up the search for gold , and decided to return to Spain . He wished to tell King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of the islands he had visited .</p>
   <p>He was sure that he had discovered a new way to India , and he wished to ask the king for more ships and more men . He believed that great riches could be found on these islands which he had visited .</p>
   <p>Early in January he gave a farewell feast to the natives . Then he sailed for Spain , taking with him six Indians .</p>
   <p>His flagship , the Santa Maria , had been wrecked . One of his captains had sailed away in the Pinta and had not returned . And so Columbus was obliged to cross the ocean in the Nina , which was the smallest of his three ships .</p>
   <p>The voyage was long and the storms were many . The little ship was tossed about by the waves and was often in great danger . But at last the shores of Spain were seen by the sailors , and great was their joy .</p>
   <p>At noon , on the fifteenth of March , 1493 , they sailed into the harbor which they had left more than seven months before . All the people in the town crowded to the shore . For a long time they had thought that Columbus was lost at sea , and that they would never see him and his sailors again .</p>
   <p>The first act of Columbus was to lead his men to the church , where they gave thanks to God for their safe return .</p>
   <p>Very soon the good news spread over all Spain . Bells were rung , and great fires were lighted on the hilltops .</p>
   <p>King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella were several hundred miles from the seaport town where Columbus landed with his sailors . As soon as the king and queen heard of his safe return , they sent Columbus a letter asking him to come without delay to their court .</p>
   <p>COLUMBUS AT THE COURT OF SPAIN</p>
   <p>third thronged bearing honor knelt banners received turtle praise kingdom officers parrots joined listened awaiting account</p>
   <p>The time of year was delightful for the long journey through Spain . Every mile of the way Columbus and his men received a welcome . As they passed along the plains and over the mountains , men , women , and children came to see the brave sailors who had dared to cross the ocean .</p>
   <p>When they reached the end of their journey , they were met by officers of the king . Then all marched into the city through crowded streets where banners were flying .</p>
   <p>First came Columbus riding a fine horse . Next walked six Indians , painted and wearing feathers in their hair .</p>
   <p>The sailors followed , carrying strange birds and animals from across the sea . Some had live parrots which they had caught and tamed .</p>
   <p>One man carried a turtle shell almost as large as himself . Others showed with great pride the curious rings and crowns of gold which they had brought from the islands .</p>
   <p>The king and queen sat on their throne awaiting Columbus . When he came near , they rose to greet him , and they asked him to take a seat by their side .</p>
   <p>In the great room were the lords and ladies of the court and the chief men of the kingdom . Every one looked with wonder at the painted Indians and at the strange gifts which were carried by the sailors .</p>
   <p>Columbus then gave an account of his wonderful voyage . When his story was done , the king and queen knelt in thanks to God . Then the great crowd of people joined them in thanksgiving and in a grand song of praise .</p>
   <p>So great was the honor paid to Columbus that he rode with the king and his son through the streets of the city . The people thronged to see him , and they called him the third king .</p>

   <p>THE FIRST THANKSGIVING</p>
    <p>I .</p>
   <p>rejoice Thursday invited quail rushes lowlands dainties guests arrived cranberries already whoops</p>
   <p>Almost a year had passed since the first company of Pilgrims had come to America . About fifty of those who had crossed the ocean in the Mayflower were now living in their new home .</p>
   <p>They had laid out a village street and had built a few houses in the place which they called Plymouth . Their houses were made of logs . The roofs were very steep and were covered with grass and rushes .</p>
   <p>It had been a busy summer for the Pilgrims . They had worked hard in the gardens and the fields . But the harvests were good and there would be food enough for the coming winter . How thankful they were !</p>
   <p>“ Let us set aside a day in which to give thanks for this great harvest , ” they said . “ It is God who has sent the sunshine and the rain to make the seeds grow . We will have a day of thanksgiving , and ask the friendly Indians to come and rejoice with us . ”</p>
   <p>So the Indian chief and his band were invited to the feast . Such a busy time as that was for the Pilgrims ! The men went to the forest to hunt deer , wild turkeys , and other game . All the women were at work , and the smoke of the ovens rose from the chimneys .</p>
   <p>Even the children helped . Some of them gathered the cranberries that were turning red in the lowlands . Some picked the wild grapes that were growing purple on the vines . Others brought home the nuts which were falling from the trees . The older boys were sent to the beach for clams .</p>
   <p>The Indians were invited to come on Thursday . At sunrise on that day the Pilgrims were awakened by whoops and yells which told them that their guests had already arrived .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>A great fire was built out of doors for the cooking , and long tables were spread in the open air . When the loud roll of the drum was heard , all the people went to the log fort on the hill which was used as a meeting house . There they gave thanks to God for the rich harvest of the year .</p>
   <p>Everybody , young and old , was there . The little children must have grown very tired of the long sermon . They must have wanted to go home to the good dinner which they knew was waiting for them .</p>
   <p>At last the Thanksgiving feast was ready . In the middle of the long table stood a huge bowl of stew made of different kinds of game .</p>

   <p>There were great roasts of deer and roasted turkeys stuffed with nuts . There were the cakes and puddings made by the Pilgrim mothers . And it is said that the Indians brought a large basket of popcorn which they poured on the table just as the meal began .</p>
   <p>In this way the Pilgrims passed their first Thanksgiving Day in America .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Hundreds and hundreds of miles away in the white frozen north , there is a wonderful land of snow and ice . There strange little yellow people , called Eskimos , live in snow houses , and dress in the skins of animals .</p>
   <p>In summer , in this wonderful land , the sun never sets , but shines all the time , day and night . Flowers spring up , and soft-eyed reindeer wander about cropping the short grass .</p>
   <p>The ice breaks up and drifts out to sea . Great rivers of ice push forward into the water . Enormous icebergs break off from them and float away like white ships .</p>
   <p>The blue waves dance and sparkle in the sun . Singing brooks rush down the mountains . Thousands of noisy sea birds come to the rocky cliffs to lay their eggs .</p>
   <p>Glossy seals swim in the water , and once in a while a shaggy white bear goes running over the floating ice in search of seals .</p>
   <p>The Eskimos , paddling swiftly through the water in their strange skin boats , hunt these animals for food and clothing .</p>
   <p>In winter there is no sunshine at all in Eskimo land . For four long , long months it is dark all the time , just as it is here in the night . The ground is covered deep with snow , and the poor deer must dig through it with their hoofs for grass and moss .</p>
   <p>The sea is covered thick with ice , and the birds fly away . The cold is so terrible that the Eskimos would freeze to death were it not for their thick , warm fur coats .</p>

   <p>And such a funny little house it was where she was found . It was only one story high . The walls were more than a foot thick , and the outside was covered with heavy black paper . All around the house was a veranda . Its walls were built of boxes of biscuit , sugar , coffee , and tea .</p>
   <p>Inside the house , the little room where the baby lived was lined with soft warm blankets . There was a bright carpet on the floor and pictures on the walls .</p>
   <p>All these things , like the boxes of food outside , came in the ship which brought the baby 's father and mother to this strange country .</p>
   <p>One window of the baby 's room looked out upon a great river of ice . From the other window you could see high red and brown mountains . And here was the sea in which strange-looking icebergs floated .</p>

   <p>When the people of that land heard that there was a white baby in the small black house , they came hundreds of miles to see the little stranger .</p>
   <p>They talked to the baby in their own queer language . They called her the Snow Baby , and they brought her presents of fur mittens and little sealskin boots .</p>
   <p>After the sun went away the baby lived for days and weeks in a little room lined with blankets . A lamp was kept burning in the room all the time , both day and night .</p>
   <p>One of the Eskimo women made a little suit of clothes for the baby , all out of furs . There were only two pieces in this suit . First there was a pair of little trousers and boots made together . Over this a hooded coat was worn .</p>
   <p>When the sun returned , the Snow Baby was taken out of doors every day . No matter how cold it was she had a sleigh ride on her little Eskimo sledge . You should have seen her team of dogs with their bright eyes , their sharp-pointed ears , and their big bushy tails .</p>
   <p>For nearly a year the Snow Baby lived in this strange , northern home . But one day in August a big black ship came up the bay . It was the same ship that had brought the Snow Baby 's father and mother to the Snowland .</p>
   <p>Then the baby and her mother went on board the ship and steamed away south to their own American home .</p>

   <p>Perhaps you would like to visit an Eskimo family , and see how these yellow people live in a snow house . But how shall we get into the house ? There seems to be no door in this strange-looking mound of snow .</p>
   <p>We must bow our heads and crawl on our hands and knees through a dark passage . Soon we come to an open space where we stand upright in a dimly lighted room .</p>
   <p>All around the room is a bank of snow next to the wall of the house . The top of this bank is broad and level like a table . It is covered with the thick skins of reindeer , bear , and foxes . Here the family eat and sleep , and here the children play .</p>
   <p>Near the doorway stands the stove , on a raised platform . You would think it a very poor stove , for it is only a hollow stone filled with oil and moss . When the moss is lighted , it burns like the wick of a lamp .</p>
   <p>This stove warms the room , melts the water for drinking , dries wet clothing , and thaws the frozen meat . It lights the room dimly and we see the Eskimo father , mother , and children in their snow house .</p>
   <p>A bag is lying on the thick furs . Now it moves and the mother takes it in her arms . See , it is a baby boy in a bag of feathers .</p>
   <p>When an Eskimo baby is in the house , he lies in his feather bag . And when he is out of doors , he is always on his mother 's back , inside of her fur hood .</p>
   <p>As soon as an Eskimo boy is old enough to walk , he has a puppy for a playmate . He learns to harness his dog and drive it all around the room . Soon he will be able to drive a team of dogs , as his father does , and ride swiftly over the snow .</p>

   <p>The large boys catch fish and hunt seal . They even help to kill great whales and fierce white bears .</p>
   <p>But what does the little Eskimo girl do ? The little sister learns to sew and to make clothes out of skins . She makes her own needle from a hard bone or a piece of iron , and she twists thread from strips of deerskin . Everything the Eskimos use they make with their own hands .</p>
   <p>Sometimes our ships force their way through the frozen ocean to their land of ice and snow . The Eskimo people think these great ships the most wonderful things they have ever seen .</p>

    <head>HOW PLANTS GROW</head>
     <l n="1">trunk halves dissolves juice</l>
     <l n="2">swells course openings blood</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Cut an apple into halves and take out one of the little brown seeds . How small it is ! Now look at an apple tree . Did the apple tree come out of a little brown seed like the one you hold in your hand ?</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>You say that it did . Look again . Which is larger , the seed or the apple tree ? And now you laugh , as you say : “ Of course an apple tree is larger than an apple seed . ” Then there must be something in the apple tree that was not in the seed .</p>
   <p>The tree has a trunk or stem . It has leaves and it has roots . How were all these made ?</p>
   <p>Do you say that the apple tree grew ? But what do you mean by growing ? Something must have come into the apple seed to make it grow into a plant . And something must have come into the little green apple plant to make it grow into a tree .</p>
   <p>What was it ? Where did the plant get it ? Cut into a green stem of the apple tree . See how the juice runs out !</p>
   <p>The apple tree was made from this juice which we call sap . This sap is the blood of the plant . It makes the plant grow just as your blood makes you grow .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The sap came to the little apple plant all the time it was growing .</l>
     <l n="2">But where did the plant get the sap ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The food of a plant lies all about its roots . The rain , or water from your watering pot , falls around the plant . It sinks into the ground . Then the water dissolves the earth just as it dissolves sugar .</p>
   <p>The seed swells , and the brown seed coat bursts . Then a little root runs down into the earth . This root has hundreds of openings or mouths . The little openings are so small that our eyes can not see them .</p>
   <p>The roots suck in the water from the ground . The earth that is dissolved in the water creeps up into the plant . This juice or sap makes the plant grow .</p>
   <p>But the plant must have air as well as food . The sap can not turn into wood and bark and fruit until it has met the air . So the sap flows up into the leaves and meets the air .</p>
   <p>Then it finds its way into every part of the plant . It changes into the rough bark and hard wood of the apple tree . It changes into pink apple blossoms and buds . It changes into red apples and yellow apples . The same sap makes sweet apples and sour apples . Every part of a plant is made from sap . Is not that very strange ?</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Apple Blossoms .</p>
   </figure>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">We have learned that the roots take the food of plants from the earth .</l>
     <l n="2">They do more than this . The roots are the feet of the plant .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You could not stand without your feet . You would fall on the ground or the floor . And so the tree or the plant could not stand without its roots .</p>
   <p>Other plants grow just as the apple tree grows . The roots of a plant get food from the earth and keep the plant in its place in the ground . The stem makes the plant strong and holds it up in the air . And the leaves draw in just what the plants need from the air around them .</p>

   <p>“ The ducks seem to be having a fine time on the pond . They like the rain . If I only had a coat of feathers , I should n't mind a little wetting . I could dive and splash about all day long . But now I suppose I must go to sleep , for there seems to be nothing else for me to do . ”</p>

   <p>Flap , flap , flap ! “ What is that at the window ? ” Flap , flap , flap ! In flew a dozen geese . “ Quack , quack ! quack ! Who carried off our feathers ? ” they were screaming . They flew around the room , beating their wings against the walls and ceiling .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>After the morning meal the lambs began to frolic . They raced across the pasture . They bounded over the stones that lay in their way . They seemed to plan their plays as children do , and everywhere Lambkin White was the leader .</p>
   <p>Suddenly , he left his companions and ran to a large , flat rock . Upon this he jumped and stood waiting . Every lamb followed him . What the new game was called in sheep language no one can tell . But they chased one another like boys in a game of tag .</p>
   <p>The sun crept up the sky and the air grew hotter . And now the sheep stopped eating grass . They turned , all together , into a path that led to their drinking place .</p>
   <p>But to-day they could find no water . Instead of the spring which had bubbled out from under the great rock there were only stones and dry sand .</p>
   <p>Down the hill the flock slowly wound its way , looking for water . But Lambkin White did not walk with the flock . He ran here and there . He climbed rocks and hid behind trees . Indeed , could the mother sheep have spoken , she would have called him a very troublesome lambkin .</p>
   <p>The pasture sloped down to a piece of low , wet land . A wooden bridge or trestle had been built across the marsh for a railroad track . Trains of cars rolled over this high bridge nearly every hour of the day .</p>
   <p>On came the sheep to the very edge of the swamp . Here they found black mud , but not a drop of water to drink .</p>
   <p>Near the end of the trestle was a cask , or water barrel , which had been sunk into the ground . Lambkin White ran to the barrel and looked in . There was some water in the cask , and the thirsty lamb stretched his neck farther and farther down to get a drink . Before his mother could reach him he fell , head foremost , into the water barrel .</p>

   <p>Poor little lamb ! The smooth sides of the barrel were all around him and he could not get out . The helpless mother was in great distress , but what could she do ? Her little one was drowning before her eyes , and she could not save him !</p>
   <p>The lamb 's wild struggles were growing slower and slower . His limbs now moved feebly . In a moment more the brave young heart would stop beating . Soon there would be one less in the flock . Soon there would be a sad mother sheep calling in vain for her little lamb .</p>
   <p>Just then a shrill whistle sounded across the marsh . Over the trestle came the great locomotive dragging a train of cars filled with passengers .</p>
   <p>The foolish sheep , in their terror , ran along the railroad track in front of the moving train .</p>
   <p>But Lambkin White 's mother still stood by the water cask . Nearer and nearer came the terrible noise of the engine . The black monster was coming directly toward her . Soon it will be upon her !</p>
   <p>Will she not run away from danger ? Will she not join the flock ? No ! for the mother heart is brave and the mother love is strong . If she can not save her darling , she can , at least , die by his side .</p>

   <p>The engineer was watching with sharp eyes the flock of sheep on the track ahead . He saw the lamb in the water barrel as the engine came near the end of the trestle . “ Down brakes ! ” he whistled , and the train suddenly stopped .</p>
   <p>The passengers crowded to the windows . What could be the matter ? They saw the engineer running . They saw him stoop down and lift a little lamb from the sunken water barrel . Its fleece was dripping with water .</p>
   <p>The engineer placed the half-drowned creature by its mother 's side . And then what a cheer arose from the passengers for the kind deed which he had done .</p>
   <p>The fireman drove the sheep from the track and turned them toward the hillside pasture . A brakeman pumped the water barrel full of water for the thirsty flock .</p>
   <p>Back ran the engineer to his engine . “ All aboard , ” shouted the conductor , as he swung himself upon the last car of the rolling train .</p>
   <p>Late that afternoon a happy mother sheep wandered back to the pasture with Lambkin White following very slowly in her tracks .</p>

   <p>There was once a little girl named Pearl , who had a bad habit of telling untruths . For a long time her father and mother did not know this . But at last they found that she very often said things that were not true .</p>
   <p>Now , at this time — for it was long , long ago — there lived a wonderful man named Merlin . He could do such strange things , and he was so very wise , that he was called a wizard .</p>
   <p>Merlin was a great lover of truth . For this reason children who told untruths were often brought to him , so that he might cure them of their fault .</p>
   <p>“ Let us take our child to the wonderful wizard . ” said Pearl 's father .</p>
   <p>And the mother said , “ Yes , let us take her to Merlin . He will cure her ! ” So Pearl 's parents went to the glass palace where Merlin lived .</p>
   <p>When they reached Merlin 's palace , the wise old man said , “ I know very well what is the matter with your child ; she does not love the truth . ”</p>

   <p>Poor Pearl hid her head with shame and fear . But Merlin said , “ Do not be afraid . I am only going to make you a present . ”</p>

   <p>As they were going away , Merlin looked at Pearl , and said , “ In a year from now I shall come for my necklace . Till then you must not dare to take it off . ”</p>

   <p>“ You are stretching the truth ! ” cried the little girls .</p>
   <p>Then Pearl confessed that all she had told them was false ; and at once the necklace changed to its right size .</p>
   <p>“ But what did Merlin say when he gave you the necklace ? ”</p>
   <p>“ He said it was a present for a truthful — ”</p>
   <p>She could not go on speaking . The necklace became so short that it nearly choked her .</p>
   <p>“ O dear , no ! ” sobbed Pearl . “ He said I did not love the truth , nor speak the truth . ”</p>
   <p>The girls did not laugh now . They were sorry for Pearl when they saw her weeping .</p>
   <p>At last Pearl was cured . She saw how wrong and how foolish it is to tell falsehoods . “ Never more will I tell a lie , ” said she . And she kept her word .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Before the year was ended Merlin came for his necklace . He knew that</l>
     <l n="2">Pearl did not need it now , and he wanted it for another little girl .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Since Merlin died , no one can tell what has become of the wonderful Necklace of Truth . Would you like to wear it ? Are you sure the diamond would always keep bright ?</p>

    <head>SAINT VALENTINE</head>
     <l n="1">Here is one of the many stories that have been told about Saint</l>
     <l n="2">Valentine .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Father Valentine was a priest who lived a long time ago . He spent his time in nursing the sick and in comforting the sorrowing . As he went about among his people , the children , too , found a kind and helpful friend .</p>
   <p>They liked to talk with him , and to run by his side as he went from one house to another . What wonderful stories he told them about the birds and the flowers ! How many beautiful things he taught them as they walked together through the forest and by the river !</p>
   <p>Father Valentine loved all the little creatures of the woods and the streams , and they seemed to love him in return . The birds would come at his call , and the squirrels would scamper down the trees to take food from his hand .</p>
   <p>Years went by , and at last the good priest became too old to visit his people . How they must have wished to hear again the sound of his footsteps at the door ! How the children must have missed their kind teacher and the stories that he told !</p>
   <p>Father Valentine was very sad because he could no longer go about from home to home . But he soon found a way by which he could still be of use to those he loved .</p>
   <p>As he sat in his room he wrote the kind words which had always made his visits so full of good cheer . Every day his loving messages were sent near and far . They were carried by the boys and girls who had learned from him to be happy in helping others .</p>
   <p>Soon his friends began to watch for the kind words that were sure to come to them whenever they were in need of help . Even the little children , when they were ill , would say , “ I am sure that Father Valentine will send me a letter to-day . ”</p>
   <p>After a time the good father passed away from earth , but he has not been forgotten .</p>
   <p>Each year , when the fourteenth of February comes around , we still keep his birthday .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Think of the lonely , remember the sad ,</l>
     <l n="2">Be kind to the poor , make every one glad ,</l>

   <p>Here is a picture of a famous old house . It was built more than one hundred years ago , and it still stands , painted yellow and white , as in the days of old . People come from far and near to see it , and perhaps some day you will visit it .</p>
   <p>Do you wish to know why so many people travel miles and miles to see this old place ?</p>
   <p>Two great men once lived here . The first one was a brave general . Long ago he was called from his own home to take command of an army . In those days , the yellow and white house was one of the finest places for miles around . So it was given to the general for his headquarters .</p>
   <p>If these old walls could only speak , what wonderful stories they could tell ! For in this house many plans were made , which helped to bring freedom to our land .</p>
   <p>We like to fancy that we can see the great general going in and out of the front door . He used to wear a three-cornered hat and ruffled shirt bosom , knee-breeches , and low shoes with silver buckles .</p>
   <p>This brave and noble commander led his army through many dangers to victory , and he afterward became the first president of the United States . You need not be told that the great general who once lived in the famous old house was George Washington .</p>
   <p>After many years the old house became the home of another great and good man . He did not lead armies , nor make laws , nor hold office . And yet few men in our country have been so well known or so well loved .</p>
   <p>His poems are read in all parts of the world , and his beautiful thoughts have helped hundreds and hundreds of people to love the right and to hate the wrong .</p>
   <p>And now you are eager to speak the name of the great poet who once lived in the famous old house — Henry Wadsworth Longfellow .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The famous old house looks very quiet and lonely in the picture . But there was a time when many children ran about its halls and played upon the lawn .</p>

   <p>“ How many children did Mr. Longfellow have ? Did he have any boys ? What were their names ? ”</p>
   <p>These questions are asked again and again by little people who keep the birthday of the poet and wish to learn about his life .</p>
   <p>In his journal , Mr. Longfellow tells us about his children , and it is there we may find answers to all our questions .</p>
   <p>The poet 's eldest son was named Charles . When Charles was two years old his little brother Ernest was born . Longfellow then moved his books into another room and gave up his study to his babies .</p>
   <p>And so the room in which Washington had planned battles became the nursery of the Longfellow children . Did any children ever have a more famous nursery ?</p>
   <p>In this room which once belonged to Washington we like to think that the children heard again and again the story of our first President .</p>
   <p>When Ernest was but a few days old his father told a friend that the little newcomer was a great musician . Do you know what the poet meant by this ?</p>
   <p>While Charles and Ernest were still little boys , their baby sister Fannie came to live in the nursery . Just as she was old enough to run about , the dear little girl died . Then the house was full of sorrow . Many of the poems Longfellow wrote at this time tell the story of his grief at the loss of his little daughter .</p>
   <p>Charles was six years old and Ernest four , when their father first took them to school . He left them sitting on little chairs among the other children in an old house near a large elm tree .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">It was under this same tree that Washington took command of the</l>
     <l n="2">American army .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As time went on three little girls took the places of the boys in the nursery . How all these children loved their father ! They thought him the best playfellow in the world , and so he was .</p>
   <p>He made toys for them , taught them games , and wrote letters which he placed under their pillows for them to find in the morning .</p>
   <p>II .</p>
   <p>beloved loss providing wreaths sealing grief happiness package coasting meant playfellow pleasure</p>
   <p>Longfellow writes in his journal about coasting with the boys for hours upon the hillside , and of working hard with all the children making a snow house in the front yard .</p>
   <p>Again he tells of charming birthday parties when children played in the hay and scrambled for sugar plums . These parties always ended with a fine birthday supper .</p>
   <p>On the first of May the children sometimes had a May party . The girls wore wreaths upon their heads and danced around the May pole . Then they all went to the summer house for a feast .</p>
   <p>In summer the Longfellow children often went to the seaside with their father and mother . All day long they played in the sand and waded in the water .</p>
   <p>But a great and terrible sorrow came suddenly to the Longfellow home . One morning , as Mrs. Longfellow was sealing a package with hot wax , her dress caught fire . Before the flames could be put out she was so badly burned that she died soon after .</p>
   <p>Never again was the poet full of joy as he had always been before . For him the happiness of life was over . But he never forgot to provide for the pleasure of his children .</p>
   <p>Longfellow has told us about his three daughters in a beautiful poem called “ The Children 's Hour . ” He has also written about them in a letter to a little girl which you will be glad to read .</p>

   <p>The oldest is about your size ; but as little girls keep changing every year I can never remember exactly how old she is , and have to ask her mamma , who has a better memory than I have . Her name is Alice . I never forget that . She is a nice girl and loves poetry almost as much as you do .</p>
   <p>The second is Edith , with blue eyes and beautiful golden locks which I sometimes call her nankeen hair to make her laugh . She is a busy little woman and wears gray boots .</p>
   <p>The youngest is Allegra , which you know means merry ; and she is the merriest little thing you ever saw — always singing and laughing all over the house .</p>
   <p>These are my three little girls , and Mr. Read has painted them all in one picture which I hope you will see some day .</p>
   <p>They bathe in the sea and dig in the sand and patter about the piazza all day long . Sometimes they go to see the Indians encamped on the shore , and buy baskets and bows and arrows .</p>
   <p>I do not say anything about the two boys . They are such noisy fellows it is of no use to talk about them .</p>

    <head>GEORGE WASHINGTON , THE YOUNG SURVEYOR</head>
    <head>beyond compass Mount Vernon acres bargain undertake measure surveyor interesting</head>
    <head>It is very interesting to know how George Washington passed his boyhood . In many ways he was no better than other boys . He had a quick temper , and he soon found that he must learn to control it .</head>
     <l n="1">But he wished to make a good and useful man of himself . This story</l>
     <l n="2">tells some of the ways in which he tried to do this .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He had learned to survey land , and this knowledge soon became of great use to him . When he was sixteen years old , he went to live with his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon .</p>
   <p>He took his compass and surveyor 's chain with him . Nearly every day he went out into the fields to measure his brother 's land .</p>
   <p>A tall , white-haired gentleman often came into the fields to see what Washington was doing , and to talk with him . This was Sir Thomas Fairfax . He had lately come to America from his home in England . He owned thousands of acres of land in the new country beyond the mountains .</p>
   <p>Sir Thomas was very fond of hunting , and he liked to have Washington go with him . They often rode out together , and the old Englishman came to like his young friend very much . He saw that the boy was manly and brave and very careful in all that he did .</p>
   <p>“ Here is a boy who likes to make himself useful ; I can trust him , ” he said . And Sir Thomas soon made a bargain with young Washington to survey his wild lands .</p>
   <p>Washington loved out-of-door life , and he was very fond of riding on horseback . So he was glad to undertake the work of surveying land for Sir Thomas .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>One bright day in early spring the young surveyor started out on his first trip across the mountains . With him was a cousin of Sir Thomas Fairfax . Each young man rode a good horse and carried a gun .</p>
   <p>As there were no roads in the wild country they found their way through paths in the forest . They climbed mountains and swam rivers . At night they slept in a hunter 's cabin or by a camp fire in the woods .</p>
   <p>Often they were wet and cold and without shelter . They cooked their meat over the fire on forked sticks , and they used wooden chips and leaves for plates .</p>
   <p>One day they met a band of Indians . There were thirty of them , and their bodies were half covered with war paint .</p>
   <p>The Indians seemed very friendly . They built a huge fire under the trees and danced their war dance . One of them drummed on a deerskin stretched over an iron pot .</p>

   <p>The others whooped and yelled as they danced around the fire . It was a strange sight , and the young men looked on with wonder .</p>
   <p>For weeks Washington and his companion lived in the forest . They found the best places for hunting , and the best lands for farms .</p>
   <p>When they returned home Sir Thomas was much pleased with all that the young men told him about the new country . He made up his mind to move across the mountains and to spend the rest of his life upon his own lands .</p>
   <p>George was well paid for his work of surveying . This was the first money he had ever earned , and he enjoyed spending it because he had worked hard for it .</p>

   <p>The boy was tall and very strong for his age . He already knew how to handle an ax , and few men could shoot with a rifle better than he . He was his father 's helper in all kinds of work .</p>
   <p>It was in November when the family came to the place which was to be their future home . Winter was near at hand . There was no house nor shelter of any kind . What would become of the patient , tired mother , and the gentle little sister ?</p>
   <p>Hardly had they reached the spot chosen for their home than Lincoln and his father were at work with their axes . In a short time they had built what they called a camp .</p>

   <p>This camp was but a rude shed made of poles and covered with leaves and branches . It was inclosed on three sides . The fourth side was left open , and in front of it a fire was built .</p>
   <p>This fire was kept burning all the time . It warmed the inside of the camp . A big iron kettle was hung over it by means of a chain and pole . In the kettle the fat bacon , the beans , and the corn were boiled for the family 's dinner and supper . In the hot ashes the good mother baked corn cakes , and sometimes , perhaps , a few potatoes .</p>
   <p>One end of the camp was used as a kitchen . The rest of the space was the family sitting room and bedroom . The floor was covered with leaves , and on these were spread the furry skins of deer and bears and other animals .</p>

   <p>In this camp the Lincoln family spent their first winter in Indiana . How very cold and dreary that winter must have been ! Think of the stormy nights , of the howling wind , of the snow and the sleet and the bitter frost ! It is not much wonder that the mother 's strength began to fail before the spring months came .</p>
   <p>It was a busy winter for Thomas Lincoln . Every day his ax was heard in the woods . He was clearing the ground , so that in the spring it might be planted . And he was cutting logs for his new house . For he had made up his mind , now , to have something better than a cabin to live in .</p>
   <p>The woods were full of wild animals . It was easy for the boy and his father to kill plenty of game , and thus keep the family supplied with meat .</p>
   <p>Lincoln , with chopping and hunting and trapping , was very busy . He had but little time to play . Since he had no playmates we do not know that he even wanted to play .</p>
   <p>With his mother he read over and over the Bible stories which both of them loved so well . And , during the cold , stormy days , when he could not leave the camp , his mother taught him how to write .</p>
   <p>In the spring the new house was built . It was only a log house , with one room below and a loft above . But it was so much better than the old cabin in Kentucky that it seemed like a palace .</p>
   <p>The family moved into the new house before the floor was laid , or any door was hung at the doorway .</p>
   <p>Then came the plowing and the planting and the hoeing . Everybody was busy from daylight to dark .</p>
   <p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
   <p>HIS FIRST GREAT SORROW</p>
    <p>I .</p>
   <p>silence postage autumn duties finished preacher sycamore comfort buried grieving minister feeble</p>
   <p>The summer passed , and autumn came . Then the poor mother 's strength gave out . She could no longer go about her household duties . She had to depend more and more upon the help that her children could give her .</p>
   <p>At length she became too feeble to leave her bed . She called the boy to her side . She put her arm around him and said : “ My boy , I shall very soon leave you . I know that you will always be good and kind to your sister and father . Try to live as I have taught you , and to love your heavenly Father . ”</p>
   <p>Then she fell asleep , never to wake again on this earth .</p>
   <p>Under a big sycamore tree , half a mile from the house , the neighbors dug the grave for the mother of Abraham Lincoln . And there they buried her in silence and in great sorrow .</p>
   <p>In all that new country there was no church ; and no minister could be found to speak words of comfort and hope to the grieving ones around the grave .</p>
   <p>But the boy remembered a preacher whom they had known in Kentucky . The name of this preacher was David Elkin . If he would only come !</p>
   <p>And so , after all was over , the lad sat down and wrote a letter to David Elkin . Abraham was only a child nine years old , but he believed that the good man would remember his mother , and come .</p>
   <p>It was no easy task to write a letter . Paper and ink were not things of common use , as they are with us . A pen had to be made from the quill of a goose .</p>
   <p>But at last the letter was finished and sent to Kentucky . How it was carried I do not know , for the mails were few in those days , and postage was very high .</p>

     <l n="1">Months passed . The leaves were again on the trees . The wild flowers</l>
     <l n="2">were blossoming in the woods . At last the preacher came .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He had ridden a hundred miles on horseback . He had forded rivers and traveled through pathless woods . He had dared the dangers of the wild forest . And all in answer to the lad 's letter .</p>
   <p>He had no hope of reward save that which is given to every man who does his duty . He did not know that there would come a time when the greatest preachers in the world would envy him his sad task .</p>
   <p>And now the friends and neighbors gathered again under the great sycamore tree . The funeral sermon was preached . Hymns were sung . A prayer was offered , and words of comfort were spoken .</p>
   <p>From that time forward the mind of Abraham Lincoln was filled with high and noble thoughts . In his earliest childhood his mother had taught him to love truth and justice , to be honest and upright among men , and to honor God . These lessons he never forgot .</p>
   <p>Long afterward , when the world had come to know him as a very great man , he said : “ All that I am , or hope to be , I owe to my angel mother . ”</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Hana is a little Japanese girl . Her name , in the language of Japan , means flower or blossom . If you should see her you would say that she is as beautiful as the gayest flower in the garden .</p>
   <p>Tora is her brother and his name means tiger . He is called Tora because his father and mother wish him to be as strong and as brave as a tiger .</p>
   <p>Hana and Tora live in one of the beautiful islands of Japan . Let us visit them in their home on the other side of the world .</p>
   <p>We must cross the ocean to reach this far away land . So we go on board a great steamer and for days and days we sail over the sea .</p>
   <p>At last we come to the city where our little friends live . We leave the ship and climb into a two-wheeled carriage which is drawn by a man . He runs along the street with our carriage almost as fast as a horse can trot .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>How strange everything seems . The men , women , and children all wear gowns that look like dresses . They clatter along in wooden shoes , and they carry paper umbrellas . We ride through narrow streets . There are no sidewalks nor green lawns .</p>
   <p>And now our carriage stops . We have come to the home of Hana and Tora . The front of the house is open like a doll 's playhouse , and we can see through to the garden beyond .</p>
   <p>How clean everything looks ! The porch shines like a mirror . All the floors are covered with matting made of the whitest straw . Even the road in front of the house is swept .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">We walk toward the house , and a little girl comes in from the garden .</l>
     <l n="2">She has a clear yellow skin , bright black eyes , and smooth black hair .</l>
     <l n="3">This is Hana , and she hastens to greet us .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She drops down on her knees , and bows so low that her head touches the matting . Her mother will soon be at home , Hana says , and she begs us to come in .</p>
   <p>Does she ask us to take off our hats ? Oh , no , she expects us to take off our shoes . The Japanese always leave their shoes outside when they go into a house .</p>
   <p>Again and again the polite little girl bows her head to the floor as we enter . We sit down on the thick matting , for in the houses of Japan there are no chairs .</p>

    <head>Little Hana looks like a butterfly in her loose dress embroidered all over with bright flowers . Her sleeves are very large , and a wide sash of soft red silk is tied around her waist .</head>
     <l n="1">And now Hana 's mother returns , and Tora comes running in from his</l>
     <l n="2">play . There are more bows and more greetings .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Tora is dressed in a plain blue gown very much like his sister 's . Both the children have large pockets in their sleeves where they carry their playthings .</p>
   <p>Our friends invite us to spend the night with them . We are very glad to do so . They take us to the parlor , which is at the back of the house .</p>
   <p>It is now time for supper . A small table , about ten inches high , is placed before each person in the room . We sit on the floor as we eat . A little maidservant brings in cakes and candies shaped like flowers . She kneels and bows low as she hands them to us .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Next we have soup , which we drink from small bowls . Then come pickles and strange kinds of food that we have never before seen . Last of all rice is served from a large , round , wooden box , and we drink our tea from tiny cups .</p>
   <p>There are no knives and no forks , and so we observe our Japanese friends as they eat with two long wooden sticks . Then we take our chop sticks and try to eat the rice as they do . Hana and Tora watch us , but they are too polite to smile .</p>
   <p>After the supper is over , the grown people sit on the floor and talk to one another , or watch the children at their games . Hana and Tora play with small cards on which are printed the strange-looking letters of the Japanese alphabet .</p>
   <p>And so the evening passes and bedtime comes . The little maidservant takes us upstairs . We see no beds , and we wonder where we shall sleep . But screens are soon drawn together , and a room is made for us .</p>
   <p>Then the little maid slides back another screen , and there in the wall is a closet . Out of this she takes soft , thick quilts , and spreads them on the matting , one on top of another . For a pillow she brings each of us a small block of wood .</p>
   <p>We do not like the wooden pillows , but we sleep soundly all night in our beds on the floor .</p>

   <p>In Japan the people love the flowering trees and plant them in their gardens . Now it is early springtime and the plum trees are just beginning to burst into bloom .</p>
   <p>The children ask us to go with them and look for the first plum blossoms . The pink buds are pushing out of their brown coverings . “ Oh , I am so glad ! ” Hana says . “ Soon the peach trees will bloom , and then it will be time for the Doll Festival .</p>
   <p>“ How I wish I could show you my dolls ! I have more than a hundred , but they are all packed away in the storehouse .</p>
   <p>“ Some of them are very old . They used to belong to my grandmother and to my great-grandmother . The doll I like best was given to me when I was a baby . It is as large as I am , and it can wear my clothes .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ When the Doll Festival comes I have a merry time . In the morning when</l>
     <l n="2">I get up I find all my dolls waiting for me in the guest room .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ With them are doll houses , little tables , sets of dishes , and boxes full of pretty gowns and sashes . The first thing I do is to dress all the dolls in their best clothes .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Of course they must have something to eat , for it is the Feast of</l>
     <l n="2">Dolls .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I make tea for them and put dishes of candy and cake and rice on their little tables . It is not polite to leave anything on one 's plate , and so Tora and I have all the food that the dolls do not eat .</p>
   <p>“ For three whole days I can play with my dolls . Then I take off their beautiful clothes and put on their sleeping coats . My mother packs them in their boxes and stores them away for another year , until the Feast of Dolls comes again . ”</p>

   <p>“ Oh , yes , ” Tora says , “ I think the Flag Festival is the very best day of the whole year . Then everybody flies kites and the boys have their feast .</p>
   <p>“ What fun it is to see the huge paper fishes flying over all the houses and gardens ! Some of the fishes are as large as a man . They open their mouths and swim about in the air as if they were in the water . All day long they flap their fins and tails and rustle in the wind . ”</p>
   <p>“ But why are so many of your kites made like fishes ? ” we ask .</p>
   <p>“ Because there is one kind of fish in our country so strong and brave that he swims up stream and leaps the waterfalls , ” Tora answered . “ So Japanese parents fly kites made like fishes to help their sons remember that they must struggle bravely to win success .</p>
   <p>“ There are many kinds of fish , my father says , that can float down the stream with the current ; but there is only one fish that can swim up the stream and leap over a waterfall .</p>
   <p>“ We have many other kites too . Some of them are shaped like butterflies . Some are shaped like birds and they make a singing noise when the wind blows through them .</p>
   <p>“ On the morning of the Flag Festival I find all my toys in the guest room where Hana finds her dolls .</p>
   <p>“ Among my toys are wooden soldiers older than Hana 's oldest dolls . My grandfather 's grandfather used to play with them when he was a little boy .</p>
   <p>“ And there are banners and swords , and images of the famous generals of Japan dressed in splendid armor . My father always plays with me on the day of the Flag Festival , and he tells me about the brave soldiers of our country .</p>
   <p>“ In the evening the people light their prettiest paper lanterns , and hang them in the gardens and before every house and store .</p>
   <p>“ Sometimes my father takes me boat-riding , and the most beautiful sight of all is the river with the many colored lights twinkling from the boats . ”</p>

   </lg>
   <p>We say that a room with no furniture in it is empty . But this is not exactly true . There is one thing that the room is full of to its very top . It is something that you can not see . But it is as real a thing as the furniture . This thing is air .</p>
   <p>If you take all of your books out of the box in which you keep them , you say there is nothing left in it . But the box is full of air . When you shut it up and put it away , you put away a box full of air . When the books were in it , it was full of books and air together . Now it is full of air alone .</p>
   <p>The air is everywhere . It is always ready to go where there is a place for it . Every crack and crevice is filled with it .</p>
   <p>You see a little boy playing with a ball . What is it that he is throwing against the wall ? It is a rubber ball , you say . But is this all ? Is there not something else besides the rubber ?</p>
   <p>Suppose that you prick a hole in the ball and squeeze it . It is now good for nothing . But the rubber is all there . Why is the ball good for nothing ?</p>
   <p>It is because the air which filled the ball and made it round has escaped . The ball is of no use unless you can keep it full of air .</p>
   <p>Perhaps you think that air does not weigh anything . But it does weigh something , though very little , and its weight is well known .</p>
   <p>You can not see air , but you can sometimes feel it . You can not feel it while it is still if you are still at the same time . You can feel it only when it is in motion . When the wind blows upon you , it is air in motion that you feel .</p>
   <p>When you fan yourself , the air strikes upon your face , and you feel it . When there is a gust of wind , the air comes against you just as a wave of water does .</p>
   <p>Sometimes we say the wind blows very hard or very strong . This is when the air moves very fast . When there is only a gentle breeze , the air is moving very slowly .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When the air moves very fast , it sometimes does a great deal of harm .</l>
     <l n="2">It roots up trees and blows down houses .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The air is clear , like glass . That is , it lets you see through it . But when you look up through the air , you see that it is of a blue color . You call the blue air the sky . The sky is the blue air that surrounds the earth .</p>

   <p>Sometimes he flies out over the sea and chases the ships . He rolls great waves over their decks and drives the ships against the rocks to perish .</p>
   <p>But he plays many a queer prank even in the midst of his anger . One day he lifted a schoolhouse , turned it around in the air , and set it down with the back of the house just where the front had been .</p>
   <p>Once when he was tumbling down houses with a great racket , he found a baby in a cradle . Catching it up , he was off like a flash .</p>
   <p>Where had he taken the baby ? Would it ever be found alive ? “ Never , ” the people said . But just then a cry was heard , and there was the little child safe in the branches of a tree !</p>
   <p>This giant meddles with everything within his reach . He knocks the apples off the trees before they are ripe . He tears the vines from the house , and picks the flowers from their stalks .</p>
   <p>He is not always honest , for on washing days he often tries to steal the clothes from the line . He takes things which boys and girls leave in the yard , or on the doorstep .</p>
   <p>Then the old giant goes whistling on his way to hide his stolen goods . Sometimes he throws them under the bushes , and sometimes he tosses them into the water .</p>

   <p>When he wishes , he can be one of the greatest workers in the world . Sometimes he flies from town to town sweeping the streets . He draws water for thirsty cattle , and he grinds wheat and corn for any miller that asks his help .</p>
   <p>Up and down the rivers , and over the sea , he works by day and by night , carrying people where they wish to go . Had it not been for him , neither Columbus nor the Pilgrims could have reached the shores of America .</p>
   <p>He likes to play with boys and girls . Sometimes he is a little rough . But when there are kites to fly or boats to sail , he is the best playfellow that can be found .</p>
   <p>The strong old giant is very fond of music , too . He loves to play on the horn , the bugle , and the flute . Sometimes you hear him whistling in the keyhole and singing in the chimney . Often he flies to the pine forests , where he makes the sweetest , saddest music you have ever heard .</p>
   <p>Everything you have heard about this wonderful giant is true . And when you think of his name , you will remember many other things that he can do .</p>

     <l n="2">The young bird needs to be educated just as a child needs to be ,</l>
     <l n="3">though not exactly in the same way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">After the young bird can fly , he needs to be taught to find his own</l>
     <l n="5">food , and also where to sleep .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>He needs to know the different calls and cries of his family , and what they all mean . He has to learn to fly , and he must learn to sing . Then he must learn what to be afraid of , and how to protect himself from his enemies . No doubt there are many lessons for him to learn that we do not know about .</p>
   <p>If you watch little birds just out of the nest , you may see them being taught how to find their food .</p>
   <p>The robin mother takes her little one to the ground and shows him where the worms live , and how to get them . The owl mother finds a mouse creeping about in the grass . She teaches the owlets how to pounce upon it by doing it herself before them .</p>
   <p>The old swallow takes her young ones into the air and shows them how to catch little flies on the wing .</p>
   <p>If you watch long enough , you may see the old bird , who is training a young one , fly away . She may leave the young one alone on a tree or on the ground and be gone a long time .</p>
   <p>Before many minutes the little one will begin to call for food . But by and by , if nobody comes to feed him , he will look around for something to eat . Thus he will get his first lesson in finding food for himself .</p>
   <p>Once I saw a woodpecker bring his little one to a fence close by some raspberry bushes . He fed the young bird two or three raspberries , and then quietly slipped away .</p>
   <p>When the young bird began to feel hungry , he cried out ; but nobody came . Then he looked over at the raspberries and tried to reach one . After trying three or four times he got one . Then how proud he was !</p>
   <p>The father stayed away an hour or more . Before he came back that young woodpecker had learned to help himself very well . But the minute his father came , he began to flutter his wings and beg to be fed .</p>

    <head>It is very easy to see the birds teaching their little ones to fly . You will find the young birds sitting quietly on fences or trees . All at once the parents begin to fly around , with strange , loud calls . In a minute the little birds will fly out and join them .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Around and around they all go till their little wings are tired , and</l>

   </lg>
   <p>The mother 's sharp eyes saw her naughty son . She flew right at him , and knocked him off his perch . The next time she called , he flew with the rest .</p>
   <p>An old robin wanted to teach her young one to bathe . She brought him to a dish of water kept for their use by some people who were fond of birds .</p>
   <p>The little one stood on the edge and watched his mother go in and splash and scatter the water . He fluttered his wings and was eager to try it for himself , but seemed afraid to plunge in .</p>
   <p>At last the mother flew away and left him standing there . In a moment she came back with a worm in her mouth . The young robin was hungry , as young birds always are . When he saw the worm , he began to flutter his wings and cry for it .</p>
   <p>But the mother jumped into the middle of the water dish and stood there , holding the worm in his sight . The little bird wanted the worm so much that he seemed to forget his fear and hopped in beside his mother .</p>
   <p>She fed him , and then began to splash about . The little fellow stayed in the water and took a good bath .</p>
   <p>A careful watcher can see the birds teach many interesting things to their young ones . But one must be quiet and patient , and not frighten the birds .</p>

    <head>HOW BIRDS LEARN TO SING</head>

    <head>THE GREATEST OF BEASTS</head>
    <head>grasp Hindu smelling urge straight feeling earrings trunk roamed jungle processions tusks</head>
     <l n="1">Nandi , the Great One , was the baby 's nurse . He was one of the strongest</l>
     <l n="2">nurses that ever took care of a baby anywhere on this round earth .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the first place Nandi was large , as you have already guessed . He was twice as high as the baby 's father , and he was almost as tall as the roof of the tiny hut where the baby lived .</p>
   <p>Nandi had a long nose . It was a very long nose indeed . Perhaps you will not believe it , but his nose was as long as you are tall , my little reader .</p>
   <p>And it was a wonderful nose . It was always moving , always feeling , always smelling . With his nose Nandi could rock the cradle , and brush away the flies that buzzed about the baby 's face . With it he could pick up the smallest toys from the ground , or open the door of the hut .</p>
   <p>But you , my little readers , have another name for this wonderful , long nose . You call it a trunk .</p>
   <p>Nandi had two long , sharp teeth . They were longer than a man 's arm , and they were very strong . With them he could lift heavy logs and move great stones .</p>
   <p>But you have another name for these long , strong teeth . You call them tusks . And you have already guessed that the baby 's nurse was an elephant .</p>
   <p>The baby was a little Hindu boy , and he lived on the other side of the world . He had a brown skin , black eyes , and black hair .</p>
   <p>The Hindu baby had played with great Nandi 's trunk ever since he could grasp anything with his tiny hands . He had crawled around the elephant 's feet and slept on the ground in the shadow of the great beast . For , in the warm country of India , where the baby lived , it is always summer .</p>
   <p>One morning , the baby 's father perched himself upon the elephant 's head and rode away from his home . The child screamed with grief for his companion .</p>
   <p>“ Be still , love of my life , ” said the mother . “ Thy father has need of Nandi . He can no longer be idle . There is harder work for him to do than to care for thee , O small one . ”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The elephant 's work was to pile heavy timbers in the lumber yard , and to help unload the ships . Often he worked alone , for he needed no driver to urge him to his task . His piles of wood were always straight , and his work always well done .</p>
   <p>Once Nandi belonged to a Hindu prince and walked in long processions through the streets of cities . Then he wore gold rings in his ears and silver rings around his tusks . Red cloth , trimmed with gold , covered his great sides and hung almost to his feet . And he proudly bore upon his back the officers of the prince .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>And longer ago than that , when he was young , he had lived in the jungle . Ah ! those were happy days ! Then , with other elephants , he roamed the forest , ate the tender branches , and swam the rivers .</p>
   <p>But one day he was driven by the hunters through the forest and across the hills . Suddenly he found himself shut in on every side by a strong , high fence . Then he was caught and chained to a tame elephant who afterwards taught him how to work .</p>
   <p>Nandi often took part in great hunts for wild beasts , and he bore the marks of a fierce tiger 's claws upon his side . He helped to catch other elephants in the dark forest , and taught great beasts like himself to do many kinds of work .</p>
   <p>Nandi did not care to be free . Truly , if he had wished to go back to the jungle what could hinder ? For he worked without chain or harness .</p>
   <p>He was well cared for . He loved the evening bath in the river and the evening meal of fresh leaves . He loved his master , who was always kind .</p>
   <p>But best of all he loved the brown baby who fed him with bananas , and always welcomed his return with childish glee . How old Nandi 's bright eyes would sparkle when his little friend came near .</p>
   <p>And when the baby could run to meet him , and sit upon his great strong neck , there was no prouder elephant in all the land of India .</p>

     <l n="3">“ Sister , I wish you would tell me a story about the sun , ” said Harry .</l>
     <l n="4">“ Where does it go at night , and where does it come from in the morning ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ We live on a big round globe called the earth , ” replied his sister , “ and we travel around the sun once every year . The sun is like a great lamp in the sky . When we face the lamp , we see the light , and when we turn away from it , we are in darkness .</p>
   <p>“ As the earth travels around the sun , it whirls like a huge top . When the side of the earth on which we live is turned toward the sun , we have day . But when the earth turns around so that the sun can not shine on us , we have night .</p>
   <p>“ If the sun stopped shining , there would be no daylight , and soon there would be no heat on the earth .</p>
   <p>“ The sun is very , very hot . If it should come nearer and nearer to the earth , every plant and animal in the world would die . The rivers and the seas would dry up , and at last the great earth would melt like a ball of wax . ”</p>
   <p>“ How far away is the sun ? ” asked Harry .</p>
   <p>“ It is so far away that it would take more than a hundred years to travel the distance by the fastest railroad train . ”</p>
   <p>“ Is it more than a thousand miles ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , it is more than a million miles . ”</p>
   <p>“ Suppose there were a road all the way to the sun . How long would it take me to walk there ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Let me see , ” said sister Mary , taking out her notebook . “ If you should walk four miles an hour and ten hours a day , you would be more than six thousand years old before you could finish your journey . ”</p>
   <p>“ But suppose , ” asked Harry , his eyes bright with wonder , “ some one fired a big cannon at the sun . How long would it take the cannon ball to get there ? ”</p>
   <p>Mary looked in her notebook again . “ If a cannon ball could be shot to the sun , it would take nine years to reach it . Now what else do you want to know about the sun , little brother ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I should like to know how large it is . Does any one know ? Is it as large as the earth ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Very much larger , ” replied Mary . “ It is so large that if it were cut up into a million parts , each one of the parts would be larger than the earth .</p>
   <p>“ If a train should run at the rate of a mile a minute , it would take five years for it to go around the sun . A train going at the same rate could travel the distance around the earth in less than three weeks . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then the sun must be very large , ” said Harry . “ It is larger than anything I ever heard about . Let us call it Giant Sun . ”</p>
   <p>“ There are stars far away in the sky that are larger than the sun , ” said his sister . “ And there are planets like our earth which are near the sun . But I will tell you about them some other day . Now do not forget what I have told you about Giant Sun . ”</p>
   <p>“ Forget ! How could I , sister ? It is better than any fairy tale I have ever heard . Why , you have told me enough about Giant Sun to keep me thinking all day . ”</p>

   <p>Do you remember the beautiful picture of Aurora , and the story of Apollo , the driver of the sun car ? Here is another picture of the sun chariot , in its flight across the heavens .</p>
   <p>Once upon a time Phaethon , the son of Apollo , said to his mother , “ I go to-day to my father 's palace , ” and he started for the land of the sunrise .</p>
   <p>For days and for nights he traveled until he came to a high mountain . On its top was the shining palace of the sun . It had golden columns and silver doors . On its wall were pictures of the wonders of the earth and of the sea .</p>
   <p>But Phaethon hurried by these beautiful sights . He entered the great hall and found the Sun god just ready to drive his horses through the clouds of dawn .</p>
   <p>“ Welcome , welcome , my son ! ” said Apollo . “ I have waited long for thy coming . What is thy wish ? Tell me , and thy wish shall be granted thee . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , my father , ” said Phaethon , “ let me drive the chariot of the sun for one day across the sky . ”</p>
   <p>“ No hand but mine can hold these fiery horses , ” said Apollo . “ Change thy wish , foolish boy . You ask for death , not for honor . ”</p>
   <p>“ My father never breaks his promise , ” said Phaethon . “ I will not change my wish . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then follow my advice , ” said Apollo . “ Hold fast the reins . Use not the whip , and drive neither too high lest the earth freeze , nor too low lest it burn . ”</p>
   <p>Phaethon sprang into the sun car and grasped the lines . The horses darted across the sky . Lower and lower they plunged . The heat of the shining sun car dried the lakes and the rivers , and burned every green thing upon the land .</p>
   <p>The people cried for rain , and the great ruler of earth and air heard their cries , and looked down from his dwelling place . He flashed his lightnings at the mad driver , and hurled him from his seat .</p>
   <p>Then the great ruler led the horses and the chariot to their old track across the sky . But Phaethon never rose from the cold waters of the river into which he had fallen .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Clytie was a sea maiden , so the old Greek stories tell us . She lived at the bottom of the ocean . The white sea sand was her carpet , a beautiful shell was her bed , and the seaweed was her pillow .</p>
   <p>One morning Clytie arose , put on her moss-green dress , and went to ride in her seashell boat . A pair of fishes drew her over the beautiful sea bottom . They swam around rocks with sharp , ragged edges , and they passed through forests of sea weed and coral .</p>
   <p>Indeed , so long and pleasant was the ride that Clytie fell asleep , and she did not awaken until a big wave rolled her boat upon the shore of a green island .</p>
   <p>Then the little maiden opened her brown eyes very wide , for she had never before seen the land . There was green grass at her feet , and such flowers as never grew in her garden at the bottom of the deep sea .</p>
   <p>In the trees were birds whose songs sounded sweeter than the music of the waves that had so often lulled her to sleep .</p>
   <p>Across the blue sky rode the Sun king in a chariot which shone like blazing gold .</p>
   <p>Clytie saw that all living things looked up and smiled when the golden chariot rolled above the earth .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , that I were a land child ! ” she said ; “ then I too might gaze upon the Sun king the whole day long . ”</p>
   <p>Day after day the sea maiden came to the island . There she stood hour after hour watching the bright Sun king until his golden chariot sank into the western sea .</p>
   <p>But one evening Clytie found that she could not move . Behold , she was no longer a maid of the sea . Her dress was but a slender green stalk with dark green leaves .</p>
   <p>Her yellow hair had become a circle of golden petals . From their midst looked out the brown eyes of Clytie , no longer a sea maiden , but a beautiful sunflower with its face turned toward the sun .</p>

   <p>A little four-year-old girl stood in her room making pictures upon the white walls . On every side could be seen drawings of horses and dogs , cows , rabbits , and sheep . The walls were covered with pictures as high as the chubby hand could reach .</p>
   <p>In the doorway stood the father , watching his little daughter . So wonderful were her drawings for a little child that the neighbors often came into the tiny room to look at the pictures on the walls .</p>
   <p>“ My little Rosa will be an artist some day , ” said the father , “ but she can never be a great artist because she is a girl . How I wish she were a boy ! ”</p>
   <p>In those days it was not thought proper for a girl to do anything that would take her away from home . “ A girl should stay in the house , ” people said . “ She should spend her time in sewing and in helping her mother . ”</p>

   <p>Rosa Bonheur 's home was in France . She was the eldest of four children . Her father gave lessons in drawing and made pictures for books . The little cottage in which she was born was in a beautiful part of the country . Here , with her two younger brothers and a baby sister , she lived a happy life .</p>
   <p>Rosa loved animals , and she had many pets . Dogs that had no home came to her , and they were never turned away . She fed the wild rabbits and tamed the squirrels . If a stray horse wandered by , it was given food and water , and cared for until its owner could be found .</p>
   <p>The child artist drew pictures of all these animals . She studied them as they ran or walked or lay down to rest .</p>
   <p>When her little brothers were old enough to run about , they loved to follow their sister from place to place . Often they went with her to the roadside , where she made pictures for them in the sand with a pointed stick .</p>
   <p>Sometimes her dogs came too and sat for their pictures . The passers-by stopped to see the rosy-cheeked little girl drawing animals and landscapes along the sandy way .</p>
   <p>In the long winter evenings Rosa amused herself and her brothers by cutting pictures of animals and people from pieces of paper .</p>
   <p>A LITTLE GIRL WHO PAINTED ANIMALS</p>

   <p>But this free and happy life came to an end all too soon . When Rosa was seven years old , the family moved to Paris , where they lived in small rooms . The street was crowded with houses , and there was no yard for the children to play in .</p>
   <p>How Rosa longed for her old home and for the animals she loved . Sometimes she ran across the street to pet a wooden pig which stood just outside the door of a meat shop .</p>
   <p>About this time a great sorrow came to the little Bonheur children . Their beautiful mother died , and then they were all sent away from home .</p>
   <p>Poor little Rosa ! She did not like to study or sew , and she was very unhappy in the girls ’ school to which she was sent . Her only pleasure was in visiting her father 's studio . Here , if she could have a pencil , or a bit of clay , she was always contented .</p>
   <p>How she begged to leave school and stay with her father ! Her relatives thought this a foolish thing for her to do . “ What would people think , ” they said , “ to see a girl doing a boy 's work ? ”</p>
   <p>One day , when her father returned to the studio after a short absence , he found that Rosa had painted a bunch of cherries . He looked at her picture for a long time , and then he said , “ If you can do as well as that , I will give you lessons . ”</p>
   <p>“ And I will cut off my hair and wear boy 's clothes , ” said Rosa . “ Then I can study with you , and no one will notice me . ” So she dressed like a boy and went everywhere with her father .</p>
   <p>Lessons in drawing and painting now began in earnest . It was not long before she could help her father . Soon she was able to copy pictures in the famous picture galleries of Paris .</p>
   <p>And now the girl who did not like to study books , and who hated to sew , became one of the hardest of workers . She painted from early morning until night to earn money for her father and the younger children .</p>
   <p>At last the Bonheur family were able to have a home together once more . In a quiet street in Paris , up six flights of stairs , they found a few small rooms .</p>
   <p>But what should they do for a garden and for a place to keep their animals ? It was Rosa 's greatest wish to learn to draw and paint animals from life , and she needed to study living models .</p>
   <p>The windows of their rooms opened on a broad , flat roof . Here Rosa and her brother made a roof garden and planted flowers . Here they kept singing birds , a hen and chickens , and a pet sheep .</p>
   <p>Every morning the two boys carried the sheep downstairs , and led it to the pasture . In the evening they carried it up the long flights of stairs to the studio . It was drawn standing and lying down , eating and sleeping . It was painted and modeled in clay , again and again , by Rosa and her brothers .</p>

   <p>Rosa Bonheur now spent all her time in painting animals . She took long trips into the country to find animals to sketch . There she drew flocks of sheep , oxen at work , and cows standing in the long grass .</p>
   <p>Sometimes she went into pens where animals were kept , both in the country and in the city of Paris . Because her long skirts were in the way of her work she often dressed as men do .</p>
   <p>Her pictures were shown in Paris with those of great artists . When she was only nineteen years old , she won her first prize . This was a great honor .</p>
   <p>One of her finest pictures is called “ Oxen Plowing . ” It was finished just before her father 's death . He was greatly interested in this picture . When it was done , he was proud and happy to see that his daughter had become a great artist .</p>

   <p>Rosa Bonheur spent the last years of her life in a home of her own , not far from Paris . Near by was a beautiful forest , and in a park close to the house she kept a number of wild animals .</p>
   <p>The studio in which the artist worked was very interesting . Paintings hung on the walls and stood about the room . Birds sang in their cages . Dogs and other pets walked about or lay on the skins of wild animals which covered the floor .</p>
   <p>To this home came many poor people , whom the great artist was always glad to help . She was kind to every one , and even the animals loved her .</p>

   <p>The poor beast heard her voice . He crawled to the bars of the cage , where he could feel her hand stroking his head . So great was the love he showed that Rosa had him taken again to her home , and she cared for him as long as he lived . He died clinging with his great paws to the mistress he had loved so well .</p>
   <p>Rosa Bonheur 's most wonderful painting is “ The Horse Fair . ” The artist spent nearly two years in drawing horses before she began this great work . The picture is so large that she was obliged to use a stepladder to reach some parts of it .</p>

     <l n="1">“ The Horse Fair ” was bought by an American , and it can be seen in the</l>

   <p>When the French people wish to honor an artist , they give him the cross of the Legion of Honor . The Empress had often seen Rosa Bonheur sketching in the forest , and she thought her the greatest of animal painters .</p>
   <p>One morning when Rosa Bonheur was painting in her studio , the Empress came into the room and hung a beautiful white cross around the artist 's neck .</p>
   <p>No woman had ever before worn the cross of the Legion of Honor .</p>

    <head>WHEN BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WAS A BOY</head>

    <head>When Benjamin Franklin was a boy there were no great public schools as there are now . But Benjamin learned to read almost as soon as he could talk , and he was always fond of books .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">His nine brothers were older than he , and every one had learned a</l>
     <l n="2">trade . They did not care so much for books .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Benjamin shall be the scholar of our family , ” said his mother .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And so , when he was eight years old , he was sent to a grammar school . He studied hard , and in a few months he was promoted to a higher class . But his father was poor and needed his help . In two years he was obliged to leave school .</p>
   <p>Benjamin was a small boy , but there were many things that he could do . His father was a soap boiler , and candle maker . And so when the boy was taken from school , what kind of work do you think he had to do ?</p>
   <p>You may be sure that Benjamin was kept busy . He cut wicks for the candles , poured the melted tallow into the candle molds , and sold soap to his father 's customers .</p>
   <p>Do you suppose that he liked to do this work ?</p>
   <p>He did not like it at all . And when he saw the ships sailing in and out of Boston Harbor , he longed to be a sailor , and go to strange , far-away lands , where candles and soap were unknown .</p>
   <p>Benjamin 's father saw that his boy did not like the work he was doing . One day he said : “ Benjamin , since you do not wish to be a candle maker , what trade do you think you would like to learn ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I would like to be a sailor , ” said the boy .</p>
   <p>“ I do not wish you to be a sailor , ” said his father . “ I intend that you shall learn some useful trade on land ; and I know that you will do best the kind of work that is most pleasant to you . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The next day he took the boy to walk with him among the workshops of</l>
     <l n="2">Boston . They saw men busy at all kinds of work .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Benjamin was delighted . Long afterwards , when he had become a very great man , he said , “ It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools . ”</p>
   <p>He gave up the thought of going to sea , and decided that he would learn any trade his father would choose for him .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Soon after this , Benjamin 's brother James set up a printing press in</l>
     <l n="2">Boston . He intended to print books and a newspaper .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Benjamin loves books , ” said his father . “ He shall learn to be a</l>
     <l n="4">printer . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And so , when he was twelve years old , he was sent to his brother to learn the printer 's trade . He was to have his board and clothing , but no wages .</p>
   <p>Benjamin never attended school again , but he kept on studying . At that time there were no books written for children as there are nowadays . His father 's books were not easy to understand . We should think them very dull .</p>
   <p>But before he was twelve years old , Benjamin had carefully read the most of them . All the money that came into his hands he laid out in books .</p>
   <p>Often he would borrow a book in the evening , and then sit up nearly all night reading it so as to return it early in the morning .</p>
   <p>He spent all his spare time in studying and reading the best books that he could get . We shall find that afterward Benjamin Franklin became the most learned man in America .</p>

     <l n="5">It was a spring morning more than one hundred years ago . A young man</l>
     <l n="6">was plowing in a field near a low farmhouse .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Four men with guns on their shoulders passed along the road . “ There is Abner White , ” said one of them . “ He ought to join the army . Call to him . ”</p>
   <p>“ Abner , Abner , ” they shouted .</p>
   <p>The young man left his plow and ran to the fence .</p>
   <p>“ We are raising a company to join Washington 's army , ” they said . “ We march to-morrow . You must go with us , Abner . ”</p>
   <p>Abner walked quickly to the little farmhouse . His mother was standing in the door .</p>
   <p>“ My country needs me , mother , ” he said . “ What shall I do ? ”</p>
   <p>“ If you feel it is your duty to fight for your country , Abner , you must go , ” answered the brave woman . “ When will the new company march ? ”</p>
   <p>“ To-morrow . ”</p>
   <p>“ To-morrow ! ” exclaimed Mrs. White . “ You can not wear those old trousers . We must make you a new pair . ”</p>
   <p>“ A soldier can not wait for new clothes , and I must march with my company . A pair of trousers can not be made in a day . ”</p>
   <p>“ We shall see , ” thought his mother , as she hurried away to call her daughters .</p>
   <p>“ Is there any woolen cloth in the house , Nancy ? ” she asked .</p>
   <p>“ Not a yard ; I used the last yesterday . ”</p>
   <p>“ And there is no yarn , either , ” said Deborah , the oldest daughter .</p>
   <p>“ The sheep have not been sheared , and there is no wool . It is not possible to make Abner a new pair of trousers before he goes . There is no use to try ! ” said Nancy .</p>

   <p>The wool was quickly combed by Deborah , for there was no time to wash the newly cut fleece . Very soon the mother commenced to spin . How the spinning wheel buzzed as it twisted the soft wool into yarn !</p>
   <p>Nancy threaded the loom . Deborah wound the shuttle full of new yarn , and the weaving of the cloth began .</p>
   <p>Back and forth the shuttle flew , Deborah and Nancy taking turns . Late at night the cloth was woven , and Abner 's new trousers were cut out . All night long the sewing went on , every stitch by hand .</p>
