     <l n="1">Fair is our lot — O goodly is our heritage !</l>
     <l n="2">( Humble ye , my people , and be fearful in your mirth ! )</l>
     <l n="3">For the Lord our God Most High</l>
     <l n="4">He hath made the deep as dry ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Yea , though we sinned — and our rulers went from righteousness —</l>
     <l n="7">Deep in all dishonour though we stained our garments ’ hem .</l>
     <l n="8">Oh be ye not dismayed ,</l>
     <l n="9">Though we stumbled and we strayed ,</l>
     <l n="10">We were led by evil counsellors — the Lord shall deal with them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Hold ye the Faith — the Faith our Fathers sealèd us ;</l>
     <l n="12">Whoring not with visions — overwise and overstale .</l>
     <l n="13">Except ye pay the Lord</l>
     <l n="14">Single heart and single sword ,</l>
     <l n="15">Of your children in their bondage shall He ask them treble-tale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">Keep ye the Law — be swift in all obedience .</l>
     <l n="17">Clear the land of evil , drive the road and bridge the ford .</l>
     <l n="18">Make ye sure to each his own</l>
     <l n="19">That he reap what he hath sown ;</l>
     <l n="20">By the peace among Our peoples let men know we serve the Lord .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">Hear now a song — a song of broken interludes —</l>
     <l n="22">A song of little cunning ; of a singer nothing worth .</l>
     <l n="23">Through the naked words and mean</l>
     <l n="24">May ye see the truth between</l>
     <l n="25">As the singer knew and touched it in the ends of all the Earth !</l>

     <l n="26">The Coastwise Lights .</l>

     <l n="27">Our brows are wreathed with spindrift and the weed is on our knees ;</l>
     <l n="28">Our loins are battered ‘ neath us by the swinging , smoking seas .</l>
     <l n="29">From reef and rock and skerry — over headland , ness and voe —</l>
     <l n="30">The Coastwise Lights of England watch the ships of England go !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="31">Through the endless summer evenings , on the lineless , level floors ;</l>
     <l n="32">Through the yelling Channel tempest when the syren hoots and roars —</l>
     <l n="33">By day the dipping house-flag and by night the rocket 's trail —</l>
     <l n="34">As the sheep that graze behind us so we know them where they hail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="35">We bridge across the dark , and bid the helmsman have a care ,</l>
     <l n="36">The flash that wheeling inland wakes his sleeping wife to prayer ;</l>
     <l n="37">From our vexed eyries , head to gale , we bind in burning chains</l>
     <l n="38">The lover from the sea-rim drawn — his love in English lanes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="39">We greet the clippers wing-and-wing that race the Southern wool ;</l>
     <l n="40">We warn the crawling cargo-tanks of Bremen , Leith and Hull ;</l>
     <l n="41">To each and all our equal lamp at peril of the sea —</l>
     <l n="42">The white wall-sided warships or the whalers of Dundee !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="43">Come up , come in from Eastward , from the guard-ports of the Morn !</l>
     <l n="44">Beat up , beat in from Southerly , O gipsies of the Horn !</l>
     <l n="45">Swift shuttles of an Empire 's loom that weave us main to main ,</l>
     <l n="46">The Coastwise Lights of England give you welcome back again !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="47">Go , get you gone up-Channel with the sea-crust on your plates ;</l>
     <l n="48">Go , get you into London with the burden of your freights !</l>
     <l n="49">Haste , for they talk of Empire there , and say , if any seek ,</l>
     <l n="50">The Lights of England sent you and by silence shall ye speak .</l>

     <l n="54">sledges .</l>
     <l n="55">Song of the Dead in the South — in the sun by their skeleton horses ,</l>

     <l n="61">Song of the Dead in the West — in the Barrens , the snow that betrayed</l>
     <l n="62">them ,</l>
     <l n="63">Where the wolverine tumbles their packs from the camp and the</l>

      <l n="66">We were dreamers , dreaming greatly , in the man-stifled town ;</l>

      <l n="68">Came the Whisper , came the Vision , came the Power with the Need .</l>
      <l n="69">Till the Soul that is not man 's soul was lent us to lead .</l>

      <l n="72">In the faith of little children we went on our ways .</l>
      <l n="73">Then the wood failed — then the food failed — then the last water dried —</l>
      <l n="74">In the faith of little children we lay down and died .</l>
      <l n="75">On the sand-drift — on the veldt-side — in the fern-scrub we lay ,</l>
      <l n="76">That our sons might follow after by the bones on the way .</l>
      <l n="77">Follow after — follow after ! We have watered the root ,</l>

     <l n="43">Strict I stuck to my business , afraid to stop or I 'd think ,</l>
     <l n="44">Saving the money ( she warned me ) , and letting the other men drink .</l>
     <l n="45">And I met McCullough in London ( I 'd saved five ‘ undred then ) ,</l>
     <l n="46">And ‘ tween us we started the Foundry — three forges and twenty men :</l>
     <l n="47">Cheap repairs for the cheap ‘ uns . It paid , and the business grew ,</l>
     <l n="48">For I bought me a steam-lathe patent , and that was a gold mine too .</l>
     <l n="49">“ Cheaper to build ‘ em than buy ‘ em , ” I said , but McCullough he shied ,</l>
     <l n="50">And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde .</l>
     <l n="51">And the Lines were all beginning , and we all of us started fair ,</l>
     <l n="52">Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square .</l>
     <l n="53">But McCullough ‘ e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all ,</l>
     <l n="54">And Brussels and Utrecht velvet , and baths and a Social Hall ,</l>
     <l n="55">And pipes for closets all over , and cutting the frames too light .</l>
     <l n="56">But McCullough he died in the Sixties , and —— Well , I 'm dying</l>
     <l n="57">to-night ....</l>
     <l n="58">I knew — I knew what was coming , when we bid on the Byfleet 's keel .</l>
     <l n="59">They piddled and piffled with iron : I 'd given my orders for steel .</l>
     <l n="60">Steel and the first expansions . It paid , I tell you , it paid ,</l>
     <l n="61">When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run</l>
     <l n="62">trade .</l>
     <l n="63">And they asked me how I did it , and I gave ‘ em the Scripture text ,</l>
     <l n="64">“ You keep your light so shining a little in front o ’ the next ! ”</l>
     <l n="65">They copied all they could follow , but they could n't copy my mind ,</l>
     <l n="66">And I left ‘ em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind .</l>
     <l n="67">Then came the armour-contracts , but that was McCullough 's side ;</l>
     <l n="68">He was always best in the Foundry , but better , perhaps , he died .</l>
     <l n="69">I went through his private papers ; the notes was plainer than print ;</l>
     <l n="70">And I 'm no fool to finish if a man 'll give me a hint .</l>
     <l n="71">( I remember his widow was angry . ) So I saw what the drawings meant ,</l>
     <l n="72">And I started the six-inch rollers , and it paid me sixty per cent .</l>
     <l n="73">Sixty per cent with failures , and more than twice we could do ,</l>
     <l n="74">And a quarter-million to credit , and I saved it all for you .</l>
     <l n="75">I thought — it does n't matter — you seemed to favour your ma ,</l>
     <l n="76">But you 're nearer forty than thirty , and I know the kind you are .</l>
     <l n="77">Harrer an ’ Trinity College ! I ought to ha ’ sent you to sea —</l>
     <l n="78">But I stood you an education , an ’ what have you done for me ?</l>
     <l n="79">The things I knew was proper you would n't thank me to give ,</l>
     <l n="80">And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live ;</l>
     <l n="81">For you muddled with books and pictures , an ’ china an ’ etchin 's an ’</l>
     <l n="82">fans ,</l>
     <l n="83">And your rooms at college was beastly — more like a whore 's than a</l>
     <l n="84">man 's —</l>
     <l n="85">Till you married that thin-flanked woman , as white and as stale as a</l>
     <l n="86">bone ,</l>
     <l n="87">And she gave you your social nonsense ; but where 's that kid o ’ your</l>
     <l n="88">own ?</l>
     <l n="89">I 've seen your carriages blocking the half of the Cromwell Road ,</l>
     <l n="90">But never the doctor 's brougham to help the missus unload .</l>
     <l n="91">( So there is n't even a grandchild , an ’ the Gloster family 's done . )</l>
     <l n="92">Not like your mother , she is n't . She carried her freight each run .</l>
     <l n="93">But they died , the pore little beggars ! At sea she had ‘ em — they died .</l>
     <l n="94">Only you , an ’ you stood it ; you have n't stood much beside —</l>
     <l n="95">Weak , a liar , and idle , and mean as a collier 's whelp</l>
     <l n="96">Nosing for scraps in the galley . No help — my son was no help !</l>
     <l n="97">So he gets three ‘ undred thousand , in trust and the interest paid .</l>
     <l n="98">I would n't give it you , Dickie — you see , I made it in trade .</l>
     <l n="99">You 're saved from soiling your fingers , and if you have no child ,</l>
     <l n="100">It all comes back to the business . Gad , wo n't your wife be wild !</l>
     <l n="101">Calls and calls in her carriage , her ‘ andkerchief up to ‘ er eye :</l>
     <l n="102">“ Daddy ! dear daddy 's dyin ’ ! ” and doing her best to cry .</l>
     <l n="103">Grateful ? Oh , yes , I 'm grateful , but keep ‘ er away from here .</l>
     <l n="104">Your mother ‘ ud never ha ’ stood ‘ er , and , anyhow , women are queer ....</l>
     <l n="105">There 's women will say I 've married a second time . Not quite !</l>
     <l n="106">But give pore Aggie a hundred , and tell her your lawyers 'll fight .</l>
     <l n="107">She was the best o ’ the boiling — you 'll meet her before it ends ;</l>
     <l n="108">I 'm in for a row with the mother — I 'll leave you settle my friends :</l>
     <l n="109">For a man he must go with a woman , which women do n't understand —</l>
     <l n="110">Or the sort that say they can see it they are n't the marrying brand .</l>
     <l n="111">But I wanted to speak o ’ your mother that 's Lady Gloster still .</l>
     <l n="112">I 'm going to up and see her , without it 's hurting the will .</l>
     <l n="113">Here ! Take your hand off the bell-pull . Five thousand 's waiting for</l>
     <l n="114">you ,</l>
     <l n="115">If you 'll only listen a minute , and do as I bid you do .</l>
     <l n="116">They 'll try to prove me a loony , and , if you bungle , they can ;</l>
     <l n="117">And I 've only you to trust to ! ( O God , why ai n't he a man ? )</l>
     <l n="118">There 's some waste money on marbles , the same as McCullough tried —</l>
     <l n="119">Marbles and mausoleums — but I call that sinful pride .</l>
     <l n="120">There 's some ship bodies for burial — we 've carried ‘ em , soldered and</l>

     <l n="128">And they 'll want to send me to Woking ; and that 's where you 'll earn</l>
     <l n="129">your pay .</l>
     <l n="130">I 've thought it out on the quiet , the same as it ought to be done —</l>
     <l n="131">Quiet , and decent , and proper — an ’ here 's your orders , my son .</l>
     <l n="132">You know the Line ? You do n't , though . You write to the Board , and tell</l>

     <l n="135">An ’ you 'd like the Mary Gloster — I 've held her ready for this —</l>
     <l n="136">They 'll put her in working order an ’ you 'll take her out as she is .</l>
     <l n="137">Yes , it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside</l>
     <l n="138">( Thank God , I can pay for my fancies ! ) — the boat where your mother</l>
     <l n="139">died ,</l>
     <l n="140">By the Little Paternosters , as you come to the Union Bank ,</l>
     <l n="141">We dropped her — I think I told you — and I pricked it off where she</l>

     <l n="144">Hundred and eighteen East , remember , and South just three .</l>
     <l n="145">Easy bearings to carry — three South — three to the dot ;</l>
     <l n="146">But I gave McAndrews a copy in case of dying — or not .</l>
     <l n="147">And so you 'll write to McAndrews , he 's Chief of the Maori Line ;</l>
     <l n="148">They 'll give him leave , if you ask ‘ em and say it 's business o ’ mine .</l>
     <l n="149">I built three boats for the Maoris , an ’ very well pleased they were ,</l>
     <l n="150">An ’ I 've known Mac since the Fifties , and Mac knew me — and her .</l>
     <l n="151">After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep</l>
     <l n="152">Against the time you 'd claim it , committin ’ your dad to the deep ;</l>
     <l n="153">For you are the son o ’ my body , and Mac was my oldest friend ,</l>
     <l n="154">I 've never asked ‘ im to dinner , but he 'll see it out to the end .</l>
     <l n="155">Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar , I 've heard he 's prayed for my soul ,</l>
     <l n="156">But he could n't lie if you paid him , and he 'd starve before he stole .</l>
     <l n="157">He 'll take the Mary in ballast — you 'll find her a lively ship ;</l>
     <l n="158">And you 'll take Sir Anthony Gloster , that goes on his wedding-trip ,</l>

     <l n="165">By the heel of the Paternosters — there is n't a chance to mistake —</l>
