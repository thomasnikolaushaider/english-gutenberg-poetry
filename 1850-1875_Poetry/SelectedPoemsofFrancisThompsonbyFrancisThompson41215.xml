    <head>A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON</head>
    <head>Francis Thompson , a poet of high thinking , “ of celestial vision , ” and of imaginings that found literary images of answering splendour , died in London in the winter of 1907 . His life — always a fragile one — doubtless owed its prolongation to “ man 's unconquerable mind , ” in him so invincible through all vicissitude that he seemed to add a new significance to Wordsworth 's phrase . To his mortal frame was denied the vitality that informs his verse . Howbeit , his verse was himself ; he lived every line of it , fulfilling to the last letter his own description of the poet , piteous yet proud :</head>

     <l n="2">He serveth not for praise ;</l>
     <l n="3">For gold</l>
     <l n="4">He is not sold .</l>
    </lg>

   <p>To this aloof moth of a man science was nearly as absorbing an interest as was the mysticism that some thought had eaten him up ; and , to give a light example of his actuality , he who had scarce handled a bat since he left Ushaw College , knew every famous score of the last quarter of a century , and left among his papers cricket-verses , trivial yet tragic . One such verse acquaints us incidentally with his Lancashire lineage :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk ,</l>
     <l n="2">Though my own red roses there may blow ;</l>
     <l n="3">It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk ,</l>
     <l n="4">Though the red roses crest the caps , I know .</l>
     <l n="5">For the field is full of shades as I near the shadowy coast ,</l>
     <l n="6">And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost ,</l>
     <l n="7">And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host</l>
     <l n="8">As the run-stealers flicker to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="9">To and fro .</l>
     <l n="10">O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Born at Preston in 1859 , the son of a doctor afterwards in practice at Ashton-under-Lyne , he inherited no literary traditions . He had , to be sure , an uncle , an Oxford convert to Catholicism from the ranks of the Anglican clergy , whose name appears on the title page of Tracts which , perhaps because for their own Times , seem assuredly for no other . The seven years Francis Thompson passed at Ushaw — a college near Durham , which then possessed few literary traditions besides those of Lingard , Waterton and Wiseman , but can now boast Lafcadio Hearn 's as well as Thompson 's own — were , no doubt , influential for him ; for a certain individualism , still lingering in outstanding seats of learning , gave him a lucky freedom to follow his own bent — the ample reading of the classics . After Ushaw he went to Owens College , to qualify for his father 's profession ; in his preliminary examination distinguishing himself in Greek . His attempts to translate dead language into living dated back to these days ; though of the list of words , which some who were amused and others who were irritated put down to his own inventing , many were made familiar to him in his intercourse with Milton , with Shelley , with Shakspere — his most vital companions . If these poets went , like Alexander , as far as Chaos , and if Thompson hazarded one step more , as Emerson said Goethe did , Thompson too swung himself safely back again . In Manchester , Literature , if not Melancholy , had already marked him for her own ; and it was his Religio Medici rather than his Materia Medica that he put under his pillow , perhaps the lump of it suggesting to him his after image about the poet 's dreaming :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The hardest pang whereon</l>
     <l n="2">He lays his mutinous head may be a Jacob 's stone .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A definite reminiscence of the dissecting-room at Manchester may certainly be discovered in his allusion ( in An Anthem of Earth ) to the heart as</p>
   <p>Arras 'd in purple like the house of kings , the regal heart that comes at last To stall the grey rat , and the carrion-worm Statelily lodge .</p>
   <p>Possibly the sorrow of filial duty unperformed — a sorrow deeper with him than is common among such predestined delinquents — aggravated the bodily ailments which already beset him ; and drastic indeed were the remedies he himself prescribed . “ Physician , heal thyself ": the dire taunt took flesh , as it were , in Francis Thompson , and his plight was visible to all men . Himself he could not save . Biography strangely repeats itself , not in common mental experience only , but also in uncovenanted details of fact and incident . Like De Quincey , whose writings he took into his blood , Thompson had a nervous illness in Manchester ; like De Quincey he went to London , and knew Oxford Street for a stony-hearted stepmother ; his wealth , like De Quincey 's once , lay in two volumes , for he carried AEschylus in one pocket , Blake in the other ; and the parallel might , if to profit , be further outdrawn .</p>
   <p>To most incongruous modes of making a living he now put his hand . His assistantship in a shop near Leicester Square would have fitted him for the production of a record of Adventures among Boots ; and later , as a “ collector ” for a bookseller he must often have bent beneath the sack , which , if heavy , so he might comfort himself , was at least heavy with books . Of these things he spoke with a matter-of-fact , all-accepting , simplicity when , a little later , some verses he sent to a magazine brought him believers , who sought until they found him . After a course of medical treatment , he went to Storrington . That beautiful Sussex village has now its fixed place on the map of English literature . For there it was that Francis Thompson discovered his possibilities as a poet . On its common he met the village child , whom he calls “ Daisy , ” in the verses that are so named . And it was characteristic of this poet that from the ordinary episodes of ordinary days he made his “ golden musics . ” When he saw the sunset at Storrington , the resulting Ode was dotted with local landmarks — the cross , for instance , casting its shadow in the monastery garden . The children of the family in London , into which he was received , were the subjects of Poppy , The Making of Viola , To Monica Thought Dying , To my Godchild — all in the first book of Poems ; while two of their number have a noble heritage in Sister Songs . Constant to the end , when he died some newly pencilled lines were found , addressed “ To Olivia , ” a yet younger sister , recalling the strains of fifteen years before :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I fear to love you , Sweet , because</l>
     <l n="2">Love 's the ambassador of loss .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To their mother likewise were addressed the poems of Fair Love , labelled Love in Dian 's Lap , of which Coventry Patmore said that “ Laura might have been proud ” ; hers also were many of the New Poems .</p>
   <p>If , therefore , as one critic after another declared , a poet had dropped from the skies — those skies of light — of the Seventeenth Century , he dropped very much upon the spot . “ Mr Thompson must simply be Crashaw born again , but born greater , ” declared the first of his reviewers ; and Mr Traill , in The Nineteenth Century , inquired : “ Where , unless perhaps here and there in a sonnet of Rossetti 's , has this sort of sublimated enthusiasm for the bodily and spiritual beauty of womanhood found such expression between the age of the Stuarts and our own ? ” Mr Traill added boldly his belief — daring then , though acceptable enough now — that “ alike in wealth and dignity of imagination , in depth and subtlety of thought and in magic and mastery of language , ” England possessed in this little volume the evidence of “ a new poet of the first rank . ” More expectedly , Coventry Patmore , in The Fortnightly Review , hailed in the new-comer a disciple of their common master , the Florentine Poet of Fair Love , and expressed the opinion that “ Mr Thompson 's qualities ought to place him in the permanent ranks of fame . ” The Hound of Heaven was to Patmore “ one of the very few great odes of which the language can boast . ”</p>
   <p>Such pronouncements proved at least that a poet , who had no friend save such as his published poems gained for him , could count on an immediate recognition for high merit . For these tributes , and many more of like welcoming , placed him instantly out of range of the common casualties of criticism . And he had what poets of old to their great sorrow lacked ; he had trial by his peers ; a kind fate gave him fellow poets among his reviewers .</p>
   <p>Perhaps a more convincing sign even than that of professional praise was conveyed by the chance allusion he lighted on later in Lady Burne-Jones 's biography of her husband : “ The winter 's labour , ” she says , “ was cheered by the appearance of a small volume of poems by an author whose name ( Francis Thompson ) was till then unknown to us . The little book moved him to admiration and hope . ” And , speaking of The Hound of Heaven , Burne-Jones himself said : “ Since Gabriel 's ‘ Blessed Damozel ’ no mystical words have so touched me . Shall I ever forget how I undressed and dressed again , and had to undress again — a thing I most hate — because I could think of nothing else ? ”</p>
   <p>Sister Songs , published in 1895 — the poem of which Mr William Archer has said that “ Shelley would have adored it ” — is a poem to read aloud ; for sound and sense herein celebrate their divine nuptials . One of the high memories of the present writer is that of hearing it so read by Mr George Wyndham at the hearthstone of Byron 's granddaughter . The lines therein that deal with sex , dormant in the child-girl , yielded the poet perhaps his most amazing imagery . “ Superabundance , ” murmured some — surely a “ fault ” as happy as was ever son of Adam 's . The charge of obscurity brought against the poem was more apt ; for who that did not know of his days — and his nights — in the London streets , could follow such a poignant piece of autobiography as this ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Forlorn , and faint , and stark ,</l>
     <l n="2">I had endured through watches of the dark</l>
     <l n="3">The abashless inquisition of each star ;</l>
     <l n="4">Yea , was the outcast mark</l>
     <l n="5">Of all those heavenly passers ’ scrutiny ;</l>
     <l n="6">Stood bound and helplessly</l>
     <l n="7">For Time to shoot his barbed minutes at me ;</l>
     <l n="8">Suffered the trampling hoof of every hour</l>
     <l n="9">In night 's slow-wheeled car ;</l>
     <l n="10">Until the tardy dawn dragged me at length</l>
     <l n="11">From under those dread wheels ; and , bled of strength ,</l>
     <l n="12">I waited the inevitable last .</l>
     <l n="13">Then there came past</l>
     <l n="14">A child ; like thee , a spring-flower ; but a flower</l>
     <l n="15">Fallen from the budded coronal of Spring ,</l>
     <l n="16">And through the city-streets blown withering .</l>
     <l n="17">She passed ,— O brave , sad , lovingest , tender thing !—</l>
     <l n="18">And of her own scant pittance did she give ,</l>
     <l n="19">That I might eat and live :</l>
     <l n="20">Then fled , a swift and trackless fugitive .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And how shall that final episode be turned more explicitly ? There are still a few things left that cannot be uttered , or , if uttered , that become the counterpart , even for the willing ear , of that “ tenuity of the bat 's cry ” reported to elude the common hearing . It is even as Balzac , great talker himself , says , that everything ( especially theology I think ) is the cheaper for being discussed . Yet this untold story transcends the mere romance of De Quincey 's Ann , and might , indeed , for a moment , reverse Rossetti 's just indictment of the life of “ Jenny ” — “ It makes a goblin of the sun . ” For this “ flower fallen from the budded coronal of Spring ” took root and flourished , even in London mire , and again the fragrant petals unfolded and the greenery grew .</p>
   <p>In New Poems Francis Thompson put forth in The Mistress of Vision his stark gospel of renunciation . It is the last word of an asceticism which he practised as well as preached — most strait in its abnegation of everything but the beauty his verse , unlike his life , never could renounce . Coventry Patmore , Thompson 's true “ Captain of Song , ” used to say that the young poet 's prose was even finer than his poetry , and his talk better than both . This was a statement with the true Patmorean touch of paradox . Any way , the talk had no reporter , and of his prose — his “ heroic prose , ” as it has been called — only one example passed , during his life , into book form — the complaint made by Brother Ass , the Body , against its rider , the Soul . This was published under the title of Health and Holiness , accompanied by a Note from Father Tyrrell . But his experiences in prose , as a reviewer , were wide as his sympathies , and these were sanely universal . His articles in The Academy , under Mr Lewis Hind 's editorship , must choke up many a scrapbook . Later , his contributions to The Athenaeum afforded him his greatest scope and stimulant ; and only with his death came the eclipse of his powers . Editors forbore to be angry at his delays , for , after a while of waiting , they got from him , at last , what none else could give at all .</p>
   <p>About ten weeks before the darkness fell on him the little flame of his life began visibly to flicker . A change to the country was advised ; and he became the carefully tended guest of Mr Wilfrid Blunt — not many miles from the Storrington of his early love , to which , however , not wild arabs could any longer draw him . He was too weak for any travel , save that which brought him back to London — better , he himself said , but surely dying , as it seemed to solicitous eyes .</p>
   <p>Ten days before his death he went as a private patient to the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth , in St John 's Wood , and there , at the age of forty-eight , on November 13 , 1907 , he passed away at dawn — the dawn that was the death-hour in his Dream Tryst . He was laid to rest in St Mary 's Cemetery , Kensal Green . In his coffin were roses from the garden of Mr George Meredith , inscribed with Mr Meredith 's testimony , “ A true poet , one of the small band ” ; and violets from kindred turf went to the dead poet 's breast from the hand of her whose praises he had divinely sung . Devoted friends lament him , no less for himself than for his singing . He made all men his debtors , leaving to those who loved him the memory of a unique personality , and to English poetry an imperishable name .</p>

     <l n="31">But , whileas on such dubious bed I lay ,</l>
     <l n="32">One unforgotten day ,</l>

     <l n="34">Wide-eyed daisies</l>
     <l n="35">Gazing on it from its hand ,</l>
     <l n="36">Slipped there for its dear amazes ;</l>
     <l n="37">So between thy father 's knees</l>
     <l n="38">I saw thee stand ,</l>
     <l n="39">And through my hazes</l>
     <l n="40">Of pain and fear thine eyes ’ young wonder shone .</l>
     <l n="41">Then , as flies scatter from a carrion ,</l>
     <l n="42">Or rooks in spreading gyres like broken smoke</l>
     <l n="43">Wheel , when some sound their quietude has broke ,</l>
     <l n="44">Fled , at thy countenance , all that doubting spawn :</l>
     <l n="45">The heart which I had questioned spoke ,</l>
     <l n="46">A cry impetuous from its depths was drawn ,—</l>
     <l n="47">“ I take the omen of this face of dawn ! ”</l>
     <l n="48">And with the omen to my heart cam'st thou .</l>
     <l n="49">Even with a spray of tears</l>
     <l n="50">That one light draft was fixed there for the years .</l>
     <l n="51">And now ?—</l>
     <l n="52">The hours I tread ooze memories of thee , Sweet ,</l>
     <l n="53">Beneath my casual feet .</l>
     <l n="54">With rainfall as the lea ,</l>
     <l n="55">The day is drenched with thee ;</l>
     <l n="56">In little exquisite surprises</l>
     <l n="57">Bubbling deliciousness of thee arises</l>
     <l n="58">From sudden places ,</l>
     <l n="59">Under the common traces</l>
     <l n="60">Of my most lethargied and customed paces .</l>

     <l n="32">Relaxes and stern canon of its law ;</l>
     <l n="33">To her alone concedes pluralities ,</l>
     <l n="34">In her alone to reconcile agrees</l>

     <l n="46">What of her thoughts , high marks for mine own thoughts to reach ?</l>
     <l n="47">Yet ( Chaucer 's antique sentence so to turn ) ,</l>
     <l n="48">Most gladly will she teach , and gladly learn ;</l>
     <l n="49">And teaching her , by her enchanting art ,</l>
     <l n="50">The master threefold learns for all he can impart .</l>
     <l n="51">Now all is said , and all being said ,— aye me !</l>
     <l n="52">There yet remains unsaid the very She .</l>
     <l n="53">Nay , to conclude ( so to conclude I dare ) ,</l>

     <l n="61">None other music but to flame and glow .</l>
     <l n="62">So she first lighted on our frosty earth ,</l>
     <l n="63">A sad musician , of cherubic birth ,</l>
     <l n="64">Playing to alien ears — which did not prize</l>
     <l n="65">The uncomprehended music of the skies —</l>
     <l n="66">The exiled airs of her far Paradise .</l>
     <l n="67">But soon , from her own harpings taking fire ,</l>
     <l n="68">In love and light her melodies expire .</l>
     <l n="69">Now Heaven affords her , for her silenced hymn ,</l>
     <l n="70">A double portion of the seraphim .</l>
     <l n="71">At the rich odours from her heart that rise ,</l>

     <l n="75">From this encumbering virility ,</l>
     <l n="76">And feel the primal sex of heaven and poetry :</l>
     <l n="77">And parting from her , in me linger on</l>

     <l n="84">Of reticent withdrawal 's sweet , courted pale ,</l>

     <l n="113">Against her suffered to have lost a field .</l>

     <l n="5">Or so it seemed ; field , water , tree , were still ,</l>

     <l n="14">Nature one hour appears a thing unsexed ,</l>

     <l n="72">He lists the sweet and clear</l>
     <l n="73">Clangour of his high orbit on to roll ,</l>
     <l n="74">So gracious is his heavenly grace ;</l>

   <p>[ F ] This Poem ( found among his papers when he died ) Francis Thompson might yet have worked upon to remove , here a defective rhyme , there an unexpected elision . But no altered mind would he have brought to its main purport ; and the prevision of “ Heaven in Earth and God in Man , ” pervading his earlier published verse , we find here accented by poignantly local and personal allusions . For in these triumphing stanzas , he held in retrospect those days and nights of human dereliction he spent beside London 's River , and in the shadow — but all radiance to him — of Charing Cross .</p>

     <l n="14">Appreciations of Francis Thompson</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Such pronouncements proved at least that a poet , who had no friend save such as his published poems gained for him , could count on an immediate recognition for high merit . For these tributes , and many more of like welcoming , placed him instantly out of range of the common casualties of criticism . ” — From the “ NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON ” ( p. xii ) . As the writer of the “ Note ” has not attempted a critical estimate of the poetry , some of these Appreciations , forming a part of the poet 's life-history and even of the literary history of his time , are here reproduced .</p>
   <p>Mr Francis Thompson is a writer whom it is impossible that any qualified judge should deny to be a “ new poet . ” And while most poets of his quality have usually to wait a quarter of a century or more for adequate recognition , this poet is pretty sure of a wide and immediate acknowledgement .... We find that in these poems profound thought , far-fetched splendour of imagery , and nimble-witted discernment of those analogies which are the roots of the poet 's language , abound ... qualities which ought to place him in the permanent ranks of fame , with COWLEY and with CRASHAW .... The Hound of Heaven has so great and passionate and such a metre-creating motive , that we are carried over all obstructions of the rhythmical current , and are compelled to pronounce it , at the end , one of the very few “ great ” odes of which the language can boast . In a lesser degree this metre-making passion prevails in the seven remarkable pieces called Love in Dian 's Lap , poems of which LAURA might have been proud , and LUCRETIA not ashamed , to have had addressed to her . The main region of MR THOMPSON 'S poetry is the inexhaustible and hitherto almost unworked mine of Catholic philosophy . Not but that he knows better than to make his religion the direct subject of any of his poems , unless it presents itself to him as a human passion , and the most human of passions , as it does in the splendid ode just noticed , in which God 's long pursuit and final conquest of the resisting soul is described in a torrent of as humanly impressive verse as was ever inspired by a natural affection . MR THOMPSON places himself , by these poems , in the front rank of the pioneers of the movement which , if it be not checked , as in the history of the world it has once or twice been checked before , by premature formulation and by popular and profane perversion , must end in creating a “ new heaven and a new earth . ” — COVENTRY PATMORE , in The Fortnightly Review .</p>
   <p>It is not only the religious ecstasy of CRASHAW that they recall ; for all the daringly fantastic imagery , all the love-lyrical hyperbole , all that strange mixture and artifice , of spontaneous passion and studied conceit , which were so characteristic of the age of CRASHAW , are with the same astonishing fidelity reproduced . Where , unless , perhaps , in here and there a sonnet of ROSSETTI 'S , has this sort of sublimated enthusiasm for the bodily and spiritual beauty of womanhood found such expression as in Love in Dian 's Lap between the age of the Stuarts and our own ? To realize the full extent to which the religious , or semi-religious , emotions — now ecstatic , now awe-stricken — dominate and colour the entire fabric of these strange poems , they must be read throughout . In the lines To the Dead Cardinal of Westminster we see them at their subtlest ; and in the very powerful piece , The Hound of Heaven — a poem setting forth the pursuit of the human soul by divine grace — they are at their most intense .... That minority who can recognize the essentials under the accidents of poetry , and who feel that it is to poetic Form alone , and not to forms , that eternity belongs , will agree that , alike in wealth and dignity of imagination , in depth and subtlety of thought , and in magic and mastery of language , a new poet of the first rank is to be welcomed in the author of this volume .— H . D. TRAILL , in The Nineteenth Century .</p>
   <p>The first thing to be done , and by far the most important , is to recognize that we are here face to face with a poet of the first order , a man of imagination all compact , a seer and singer of rare genius . He revels indeed in “ orgiac imageries , ” and revelry implies excess . But when excess is an excess of strength , the debauch a debauch of beauty , who can condemn or even regret it ? Would we had a few more poets who could exceed in such imagery as this ! It is no minor Caroline singer he recalls , but the Jacobean SHAKESPEARE .— The Daily Chronicle .</p>
   <p>A volume of poetry has not appeared in QUEEN VICTORIA 'S reign more authentic in greatness of utterance than this . In the rich and virile harmonies of his line , in strange and lovely vision , in fundamental meaning , he is possibly the first of Victorian poets , and at least is he of none the inferior .... In all sobriety do we believe him of all poets to be the most celestial in vision , the most august in faculty .... In a word , a new planet has swum into the ken of the watchers of the poetic skies . These are big words ; but we have weighed them . For there is that in Mr FRANCIS THOMPSON 'S poetry which discourages the flamboyant appreciations of the more facile impressionist , and gives him pause in his ready-made enthusiasms . It is patent on the first page that there is genius in this inspiration , and the great note in this utterance ; but page after page reveals the rich and the strange , and the richer and the stranger in so many original moods and noble measures , that the reviewer feels the necessity of caution .... In nothing does THOMPSON appear more authentically a poet than in the fact that his sense of beauty is part of his religion . In this he is like SHELLEY , except that SHELLEY 'S sense of beauty was his religion , and lived in an atmosphere of sensuousness , a sensuousness that has little of the grosser taints of earth about it indeed , but which is still sensuousness . Therefore , SHELLEY wrote the glorious Epipsychidion ; therefore , Mr THOMPSON writes Her Portrait , the longest and greatest poem in his book ; and , speaking for ourselves , we shall say at once that Epipsychidion , long unique in the language , has at last found its parallel , perhaps its peer , in Her Portrait . Of this “ Her ” of Mr THOMPSON 'S we must say that she is the significance of his book . If his sense of beauty is part of his religion , his religion is that of a rapt Catholic , to whom the very heaven , with all that therein be , is open and palpable ; his is the Catholicism of profound mysticism , and of the most universal temper .... It is perfectly safe to affirm that if Mr THOMPSON write no other line , by this volume alone he is as secure of remembrance as any poet of the century . His vocabulary is very great .... Mr THOMPSON 'S first volume is no mere promise — it is itself among the great achievements of English poetry ; it has reached the peak of Parnassus at a bound .</p>
   <p>He has actually accomplished the high thing in metaphysical poetry that DONNE and CRASHAW only dreamed of . His mysticism is infinitely more profound and significant than theirs , as his imagination is more impulsive , ardent , and beautiful . He is the great Platonist of English poetry . If Mr THOMPSON had never written anything after his first volume , there would be but one Stuart poet with whom the author of Her Portrait could be compared for orchestral majesties of song , and that one MILTON .... He is an argonaut of literature , far travelled in the realms of gold , and he has in a strange degree the assimilative mind .... We do not think we forget any of the splendid things of an English anthology when we say that The Hound of Heaven seems to us , on the whole , the most wonderful lyric in the language . It fingers all the stops of the spirit , and we hear now a thrilling and dolorous note of doom , and now the quiring of the spheres , and now the very pipes of Pan , but under all the still , sad music of humanity . It is the return of the nineteenth century to THOMAS A KEMPIS .— J . L. GARVIN , in The Newcastle Chronicle and in The Bookman .</p>
   <p>The fine frenzy , and the fine line : these are two root characteristics of Mr THOMPSON 'S really remarkable poem . One has seldom seen poet more wildly abandoned to his rapture , more absorbed in the trance of his ecstasy . When the irresistible moment comes , he throws himself upon his mood as a glad swimmer gives himself to the waves , careless whither the strong tide carries him , knowing only the wild joy of the laughing waters and the rainbow spray . He shouts , as it were , for mere gladness , in the welter of wonderful words , and he dives swift and fearless to fetch his deep-sea fancies . When weak men venture on these vagaries they drown ; but Mr THOMPSON is a strong swimmer . Hyperboles , which in other hands had seemed merely absurd , in his delight us as examples of that “ fine excess ” which is one of the most enthralling of the many enchantments of poetry .... Indeed , Mr THOMPSON must simply be CRASHAW born again , but born greater . Though the conception , for example , of The Hound of Heaven — the case of a sinner fleeing from the love of Christ — is exactly in CRASHAW 'S vein , yet it was not in his power to have suggested such tremendous speed and terror of flight as whirls through every line of Mr THOMPSON 'S poem .— R . LE GALLIENNE , in The Daily Chronicle .</p>
   <p>A new poet — and this time a major and not a minor one . On the section called Love in Dian 's Lap , much might be said of its extraordinary conception and workmanship . The section is one long , beautiful song of praise , and even worship , of one whom the poet calls his “ dear administress . ” But surely never was woman worshipped with more utter chastity of passion . Whether Before her Portrait in Youth , or regarding her as A poet breaking silence , or only reflecting on her wearing of a new dress , the Poet is so full of fine matter and so adoring in his expression of it , as to bring DANTE himself to mind .— St . James 's Gazette .</p>
   <p>Here are dominion — domination over language , and a sincerity as of Robert Burns .... The epithet sublime has been sadly stained and distorted by comic writers , and there is a danger in applying it in its honest light without warning . This safeguard established , we have to say that in our opinion Mr THOMPSON 'S poetry at its highest attains a sublimity unsurpassed by any Victorian poet — a sublimity which will stand the hideous test of extracts . In Her Portrait a constant interchange of symbol between earthly and heavenly beauty pulses like day and night .— JOHN DAVIDSON , in The Speaker .</p>
   <p>When at the end of 1893 there appeared a little quarto volume of poems by FRANCIS THOMPSON , the English world of letters experienced an agreeable shock of surprise . It was as if a rocket had been sent up into a dark night . His poems have all the “ pomp and prodigality ” of imagination for which Gray 's frugal muse longed .— The Spectator .</p>
   <p>Words and cadences must have had an intoxication for him , the intoxication of the scholar ; and “ cloudy trophies ” were continually falling into his hands , and half through them , in his hurry to seize and brandish them . He swung a rare incense in a censer of gold , under the vault of a chapel where he had hung votive offerings . When he chanted in his chapel of dreams , the airs were often airs which he had learnt from CRASHAW and from PATMORE . They came to life again when he used them , and he made for himself a music which was part strangely familiar and part his own , almost bewilderingly . Such reed-notes and such orchestration of sound were heard nowhere else ; and people listened to the music , entranced as by a new magic . The genius of FRANCIS THOMPSON was Oriental , exuberant in colour , woven into elaborate patterns , and went draped in old silk robes , that had survived many dynasties . The spectacle of him was an enchantment ; he passed like a wild vagabond of the mind , dazzling our sight . He had no message , but he dropt sentences by the way , cries of joy or pity , love of children , worship of the Virgin and the Saints , and of those who were patron saints to him on earth ; his voice was heard like a wandering music , which no one heeded for what it said , in a strange tongue , but which came troublingly into the mind , bringing it the solace of its old , recaptured melodies .— ARTHUR SYMONS , in The Saturday Review .</p>
   <p>To read Mr FRANCIS THOMPSON 'S Poems , then , is like setting sail with DRAKE or HAWKINS in search of new worlds and golden spoils . He has the magnificent Elizabethan manner , the splendour of conception , the largeness of imagery .— KATHERINE TYNAN-HINKSON , in The Bookman .</p>
   <p>As a matter of fact — such fact as one kisses the book to in a court of law — it was in a railway carriage on my way back to London that I first read Mr THOMPSON 'S poem , The Mistress of Vision ; but , in such truth as would pass anywhere but in a court of law , it was at Cambridge , in the height of the summer term and in a Fellows ’ Garden that the revelation first came . I thought then in my enthusiasm that no such poem had been written or attempted since COLERIDGE attempted , and left off writing , Kubla Khan . In a cooler hour I think so yet ; and , were my age twenty-five or so , it would delight me to swear to it , riding to any man 's drawbridge who shuts his gates against it , and blowing the horn of challenge . It is verily a wonderful poem ; hung , like a fairy tale , in middle air — a sleeping palace of beauty set in a glade in the heart of the woods of Westermain , surprised there and recognized with a gasp as satisfying , and summarizing a thousand youthful longings after beauty . To me also my admiration seemed too hot to last ; but four or five years leave me unrepentant . It seemed to me to be more likely to be a perishable joy , because I had once clutched at , and seemed to grasp , similar beauties in POE . Mr THOMPSON 'S thought , always strong , often runs into phrases of exquisite sweetness and exquisite clarity .... The lines beginning :</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Thompson 's poetry is a “ wassail of orgiac imageries . ” He is a poet 's poet , like SHELLEY and BLAKE . In order to follow him as he soars from image to image and symbol to symbol , you must have the rare wings of imagination .... THOMPSON mixes his metaphors so wisely that they illumine each other , strange light shooting out of their weltering chaos , like the radiance of phosphorescent waves . He troubles you with sudden pictures that flash out against the blackness . This gift of dreadful vision is not found in CRASHAW or in PATMORE , in DONNE or in HERBERT , and therefore it seems to me that THOMPSON is essentially more akin to BLAKE , COLERIDGE and ROSSETTI than to the ecclesiastical mystics . He is a twentieth-century mystic with a seventeenth-century manner .— JAMES DOUGLAS , in The Morning Leader .</p>
   <p>Great poets are obscure for two opposite reasons ; now , because they are talking about something too large for anyone to understand , and now , again , because they are talking about something too small for anyone to see . FRANCIS THOMPSON possessed both these infinities .... He was describing the evening earth with its mist and fume and fragrance , and represented the whole as rolling upwards like a smoke ; then suddenly he called the whole ball of the earth a thurible , and said that some gigantic spirit swung it slowly before God . This is the case of the image too large for comprehension ; another instance sticks in my mind of the image which is too small . In one of his poems he says that the abyss between the known and the unknown is bridged by “ Pontifical death . ” There are about ten historical and theological puns in that one word . That a priest means a pontiff , that a pontiff means a bridge-maker , that death is certainly a bridge , that death may turn out after all to be a reconciling priest , that at least priest and bridges both attest to the fact that one thing can get separated from another thing — these ideas , and twenty more , are all tacitly concentrated in the word “ Pontifical . ” In FRANCIS THOMPSON 'S poetry , as in the poetry of the universe , you can work infinitely out and out , but yet infinitely in and in . These two infinities are the mark of greatness ; and he was a great poet .— G . K. CHESTERTON , in The Illustrated London News .</p>
   <p>Thompson used his large vocabulary with a boldness — and especially a recklessness , almost a frivolity in rhyme — that were worthy of BROWNING . On the other hand , these rugged points were , at a further view , absorbed into the total effect of beauty in a manner which BROWNING never achieved ; for the poet , entirely free from timidity in matters of poetic form , relied not on chastity or perfection of detail , but on the perfervid rush of his genius , which simply carried his readers over the rough places . Here was a large utterance — large in bulk , in speed , in a lavish disregard of economy , and yet , what could not for a moment be mistaken was that the poetry was at once great and sincere . These Sister Songs , written in praise of two little sisters , contain a number of lovely and most musical lines , and some passages — such as the seventh section of the first poem — which SPENSER would not have disowned .— The Times .</p>
   <p>The greater a poet 's message , the more profound his thought , the larger his range , and the more exquisite his note , the deeper and more incessant will be his demand upon his reader . That is why the great poets have had to wait for their recognition . Only the few will or can co-operate at the beginning , but they are the leaven ; and now whole masses can see the poetic purport of SHELLEY , COLERIDGE , KEATS and WORDSWORTH , of whom the contemporary criticism was a thing over which you laugh or cry , as the mood has you . Those who see in Mr FRANCIS THOMPSON an authentic poet have at any rate the profound interest of watching the various stages in the making of their immortal . How have the portents followed the precedent afforded by the poets just named ? In general , very accurately , we think . The common attitude of critics towards them and him has been very similar — in the case of SHELLEY it is so near in its very wording as to be sometimes startling . Extravagances and novelties of diction , a toppling over of images , and “ obscurity ” — of course that — were dwelt upon by objectors — very just objectors , no doubt — who busied and troubled about details , lost all sense of proportion , and had no ear for the great and ultimate meaning of the poet 's message .... The note that comes most majestically from Mr THOMPSON is that of the reconciliation of the two natures and destinies of man . To that literal oneness WORDSWORTH groped in his merely “ kindred points of heaven and home . ” Of that oneness ROSSETTI has the hint , and COVENTRY PATMORE the full vision . Mr THOMPSON is the heir of the poets , and he has entered fully into his inheritance . He has not picked their flowers and worn them fading ; their seed has passed into his life , and they have blossomed anew .— The Academy .</p>
   <p>No other among the younger poets so effectually proclaimed a mastery of the grand style : none other had so securely occupied a position on the right side of the line which for ever separates inspiration from talent , poetry from agreeable verse . He appeared on the scene fully equipped . There were no long years of public neglect , or production of volumes which lay unnoticed on the bookstalls before being cast into the dust heap . The marvellous splendour of his first volume revealed a writer of no common order ; with a secureness of touch , a magical decoration of style , and a real message behind all the pomp and glitter and dazzling display . It was art not for art 's sake , but charged with a meaning and a name . The Hound of Heaven was hailed by all competent critics as one of the great religious poems of this time or of any time .— The Daily News .</p>
