    <docTitle><titlePart>Entered according to Act of the Parliament of Canada , in the year one thousand nine hundred and six , by JEAN BLEWETT , at the Department of Agriculture . TO Lillian Massey Treble A woman with a heart of gold I heard her called before I knew How noble was that heart and true , How full of tenderness untold . Her sympathies both broad and sure , Her one desire to do the right — Clear visioned from the inner light God gives to souls unworldly , pure . A heart of gold that loves and gives , God 's almoner from day to day , Of her there is but this to say : The world is better that she lives .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <l n="61">And here was the farm with its orchards and meadows ,</l>
     <l n="62">The big maple trees all throwing their shadows ,</l>
     <l n="63">The stubble-fields yellow , the tall stacks of clover ,</l>
     <l n="64">The wag of the stub of a tail on old Rover .</l>
     <l n="65">And here came dear Mary , her hat on her shoulder ,</l>
     <l n="66">With Sue trying hard to catch her and hold her ;</l>
     <l n="67">Here came Tommy and Joe , always foot in their classes ,</l>
     <l n="68">And Bob , with his features all crumbs and molasses ,</l>
     <l n="69">Carrying a basin with fishworms and dirt in —</l>
     <l n="70">Oh , that scalawag , Bob , I 'm morally certain</l>
     <l n="71">Is a chip of the old block — it just seemed to strike me</l>
     <l n="72">They 'd named the boy rightly , for he was so like me —</l>
     <l n="73">All laughing and calling : “ Here 's grandpa to play with ! ”</l>
     <l n="74">And Bob supplementing : “ And sleep ‘ ith and stay ‘ ith ! ”</l>
     <l n="75">And then such a hugging , with Molly behind me ,</l>
     <l n="76">The tears came so fast that they threatened to blind me .</l>
     <l n="77">My heart overflowed with sorrow and pity</l>
     <l n="78">For the boy I had left back there in the city .</l>
     <l n="79">His lot is a hard one — indeed , I 'm not joking —</l>
     <l n="80">He lives with a woman who sniffs when he 's smoking .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="81">The supper we had , sir , and when it was over</l>
     <l n="82">The walk round the homestead close followed by Rover ,</l>
     <l n="83">Who 's most like a human . You 'd fancy him saying :</l>
     <l n="84">“ See those stacks ? Oh , yes , we have finished the haying !</l>
     <l n="85">That colt should be broken . Old friend , I 'd just mention</l>
     <l n="86">This farm stands in need of our closest attention . ”</l>
     <l n="87">And when , the lamp lighted , with Mary 's beside me ,</l>
     <l n="88">The boys at my feet , and Bob up astride me ,</l>
     <l n="89">I felt like a king — I really can n't write it —</l>
     <l n="90">Molly must take my pipe and fill it and light it ,</l>
     <l n="91">Then plump herself down in her own little rocker</l>
     <l n="92">For a visit with me . Oh , she is a talker</l>
     <l n="93">Worth the listening to . The threshing was over ,</l>
     <l n="94">Joe had got ten dollars a ton for the clover ,</l>
     <l n="95">Deacon Hope had had a sharp tiff with the preacher</l>
     <l n="96">Over immersion , and the pretty school-teacher</l>
     <l n="97">Intended to marry — resigned her position .</l>
     <l n="98">Yes , most of the church folks had signed the petition</l>
     <l n="99">Against granting a license to Baker 's saloon ,</l>
     <l n="100">The Thanksgiving service would be coming on soon ,</l>
     <l n="101">The neighbors were hearty , had every one missed me —</l>
     <l n="102">Right here Molly stood on her tip-toes and kissed me .</l>
     <l n="103">Sho ! Sam 's wife is handsome and cultured and clever ,</l>
     <l n="104">But she 's not the woman that Molly is — never .</l>
     <l n="105">Molly 's smile is so kind , and her hair is so glossy ,</l>
     <l n="106">Her brown eyes look at you so sweet and so saucy !</l>
     <l n="107">Yes , Joe 's richer than Sam , though Joe 's but a farmer ,</l>
     <l n="108">For his home atmosphere is brighter and warmer .</l>
     <l n="109">Sam has lots of money , there 's no use denying ;</l>
     <l n="110">Has made himself wealthy , and that without trying ;</l>
     <l n="111">But what chance has a man — indeed , I 'm not joking —</l>
     <l n="112">Who lives with a woman who sniffs when he 's smoking !</l>

    <head>AT THE SICK CHILDREN 'S HOSPITAL .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A little crippled figure , two big pathetic eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2">A face that looked unchildish , so wan it was and wise ;</l>
     <l n="3">I watched her as the homesick tears came chasing down each cheek .</l>
     <l n="4">“ I had to come , ” she whispered low , “ I was so tired and weak .</l>
     <l n="5">My spine , you know ! I used to be so strong , and tall , and straight !</l>
     <l n="6">I went to school and learned to read and write upon a slate ,</l>
     <l n="7">And add up figures — such a lot , and play with all my might ,</l>
     <l n="8">Until I hurt my back — since then I just ache day and night .</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Tis most a year since I could stand , or walk around at all ;</l>
     <l n="10">All I am good for now , you see , is just to cry and crawl . ”</l>
     <l n="11">Poor , pale-faced thing ! there came to us the laughter gay and sweet</l>
     <l n="12">Of little ones let out from school , the sound of flying feet .</l>
     <l n="13">She listened for a moment , then turned her to the wall</l>
     <l n="14">To hide the tears . “ Oh , me ! ” she cried , “ I 'm tired of it all .</l>
     <l n="15">I feel so hurt and useless , why can n't I run about</l>
     <l n="16">As others do ? ” “ Some day , please God , you will , ” I said , but doubt</l>
     <l n="17">Was in the eyes she turned on mine , and doubt was in her tone .</l>
     <l n="18">“ Perhaps , ” she faltered , then the pain grew harsh ; the plaintive moan</l>
     <l n="19">Smote sharply on my heart . I knew she had but lately come</l>
     <l n="20">From mother 's care and father 's love , and all the joys of home .</l>
     <l n="21">“ I wished I 'd lived on earth , ” she sobbed , “ a long , long time ago ,</l>
     <l n="22">When Jesus came at eventide , because He loved folks so ,</l>
     <l n="23">And just by stretching out His hand made all the sick folks well .</l>
     <l n="24">If it were now , oh , would n't I creep close to Him , and tell</l>
     <l n="25">All that I wanted Him to do . I 'd kneel down low and say :</l>
     <l n="26">‘ It is my back , dear Jesus , please cure it right away .</l>
     <l n="27">I 'm tired of being weak and sick , I want to jump and run ,</l>
     <l n="28">And play at games , and laugh out loud , and have such heaps of fun !</l>
     <l n="29">Be good to your poor crippled girl , ’ and He would touch me — so —</l>
     <l n="30">And every atom of the pain and crookedness would go . ”</l>
     <l n="31">I held her close , and kissed her , and soothed her off to rest ,</l>
     <l n="32">So frail she was , so homesick for the ones she loved the best !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="33">But yesterday I saw her , and would have passed her by</l>
     <l n="34">Had I not caught the greeting smile , the glance so bright and shy .</l>
     <l n="35">“ Can this be you ? ” I questioned . She laughed , “ O yes , I thought</l>
     <l n="36">You 'd hardly know me when you came , I 've changed , oh , such a lot !</l>
     <l n="37">For see how tall and straight I am ! My back do n't hurt at all ,</l>
     <l n="38">And I can stand and I can walk — I never have to crawl .</l>
     <l n="39">I 'll tell you , it 's a secret , I raced with nurse last night .</l>
     <l n="40">Just think of it ! I raced and won , ” and then , in sheer delight ,</l>
     <l n="41">She laughed so loudly and so long the nurse looked in to say ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ Is not this little girl of ours quite boisterous to-day ? ”</l>
     <l n="43">“ They are so good to me , ” she said , “ I know I 'll want to cry</l>
     <l n="44">When I start off for home next week , and have to say good-bye .</l>
     <l n="45">What if I had n't come at all ? ” — the sweet blue eyes grew wet —</l>
     <l n="46">“ My back would ache and throb and hurt — I 'd be a cripple yet .</l>
     <l n="47">For folks as poor as my folks are , they have n't much to spare</l>
     <l n="48">For nurse 's bills , and doctor 's bills , and all — but wo n't they stare</l>
     <l n="49">When I go home , red-cheeked and straight , and fat as I can be ?</l>
     <l n="50">My daddy , he will never take his dear eyes off of me ;</l>
     <l n="51">My mamma , she will cry some tears , and bend her head and pray ,</l>
     <l n="52">While all the others kiss and hug ; then I can hear her say :</l>
     <l n="53">‘ Give me my girlie , she 's been gone so many long months — five , ’</l>
     <l n="54">And hold me close — oh , I will be the gladdest thing alive ! ”</l>

    <head>THE PREACHER DOWN AT COLES .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He was not especially handsome , he was not especially smart ,</l>
     <l n="2">A great big lumbering fellow with a soft and tender heart .</l>
     <l n="3">His eyes were gray and honest , his smile a friendly one ,</l>
     <l n="4">He wore his parson 's suit of black on days of state alone ;</l>
     <l n="5">At other times he went around in clothes the worse of wear ,</l>
     <l n="6">A blue cloth cap set jauntily upon his thick gray hair .</l>
     <l n="7">He cared so little how he looked , so little how he drest ,</l>
     <l n="8">That he tired the patience sorely of the ones he loved the best .</l>
     <l n="9">For a preacher , so they argued , should be dressed like one , of course ,</l>
     <l n="10">But in the winter it was tweeds , in summer it was worse ;</l>
     <l n="11">Ducks and flannels would be grimy , if the sad truth must be told ,</l>
     <l n="12">For he spaded up the gardens of the people who were old ,</l>
     <l n="13">And he ran down dusty highways at unministerial rate ,</l>
     <l n="14">Going errands for the people who really could not wait .</l>
     <l n="15">His coat-sleeves would be short an inch , his trousers just the same ,</l>
     <l n="16">For the washerwoman had them every week that ever came .</l>
     <l n="17">He cared so little how he looked , and never paused to think</l>

     <l n="19">His wife , she was the primmest thing , as neat as any doll ,</l>
     <l n="20">And looked like one when walking by her husband big and tall .</l>
     <l n="21">It almost broke her heart that he refused to give a thought</l>
     <l n="22">To how he looked , or do the thing , or say the thing he ought .</l>
     <l n="23">Sometimes , though well she loved him , quite high her temper ran ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">Think ! when the conference president came visiting the place ,</l>

     <l n="28">More like a fierce prize-fighter than a shepherd of the fold .</l>
     <l n="29">“ How did it happen ? ” questioned him the visitor so wise ,</l>
     <l n="30">With hint of laughter on his lips , and in his twinkling eyes .</l>
     <l n="31">“ Old Betty Brown , ” the preacher said — his wife broke in just here ,</l>
     <l n="32">“ A cross-grained spinster of the place who hates him , that is clear ;</l>
     <l n="33">And never did a woman have a meaner tongue than hers —</l>
     <l n="34">The slighting things she says of him , the mischief that she stirs ! ”</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">The preacher stroked his blackened eye , and laughed good-naturedly .</l>
     <l n="38">“ She does n't like me very well , but what of that ? ” said he .</l>
     <l n="39">“ The other night I found the poor old creature sick in bed ,</l>
     <l n="40">She ‘ did n't want no prayin ’ done , ’ she very quickly said ,</l>
     <l n="41">So , seeing that she was so ill and worn she could not stir ,</l>
     <l n="42">I thought with care and patience I could milk the cow for her .</l>
     <l n="43">I stroked old Spot caressingly , and placed my little can ,</l>

     <l n="45">The preacher down at Coles he was no orator at all ,</l>

     <l n="49">But oh , the welcome that he got ! I think his big right hand</l>

     <l n="51">Some of the congregation would have liked a different man ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">“ There 's not , ” he said , “ you know it , too , a better man than he ;</l>

     <l n="57">If the Lord ‘ d take an angel and gently turn him loose</l>
     <l n="58">To preach down here , do you suppose he 'd please the hull caboose ?</l>
     <l n="59">Not much ! It 's human nature to quarrel with what we 've got ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="61">But he did preach curious sermons , just as dry as they could be ,</l>

     <l n="63">But they all woke up the moment the singing would begin ,</l>
     <l n="64">And not an ear was found too dull to drink the music in .</l>
     <l n="65">For though the preacher could not boast an orator 's smooth tongue ,</l>
     <l n="66">He could reach the people 's heart-strings when he stood up</l>
     <l n="67">there and sung .</l>

     <l n="68">O the wondrous power and sweetness of the voice that filled the place !</l>
     <l n="69">Everyone that heard it swelling grew the purer for a space .</l>
     <l n="70">And men could not choose but listen to the singer standing there ,</l>
     <l n="71">Till their worldliness slipped from them , and their selfishness</l>
     <l n="72">and care .</l>
     <l n="73">Mourners turned their eyes all misty from the crosses tall and white</l>
     <l n="74">Where their loved ones slumbered softly all the day and all the night ;</l>
     <l n="75">Listening , faith rose triumphant over sorrow , loss , and pain ,</l>
     <l n="76">Heaven was not a far-off country , they would meet their own again .</l>
     <l n="77">And the white-haired men and women wished the singing need not cease ,</l>
     <l n="78">For they seemed to see the beauty of the longed for Land of Peace .</l>

     <l n="93">The preacher down at Coles he had not very much to say ;</l>

     <l n="112">For these things the active members of the Missionary Band</l>

     <l n="121">That he whispered very softly : “ Little children , let us pray . ”</l>
     <l n="122">Then he gave them to the keeping of a Father kind and wise</l>
     <l n="123">In a way that brought the tear-drops into hard old Betty 's eyes .</l>
     <l n="124">She felt an aching in her throat , and when she cried , “ Amen ! ”</l>

   <p>SPRING .</p>
   <p>O the frozen valley and frozen hill make a coffin wide and deep , And the dead river lies , all its laughter stilled within it , fast asleep .</p>
   <p>The trees that have played with the merry thing , and freighted its breast with leaves , Give never a murmur or sigh of woe — they are dead — no dead thing grieves .</p>
   <p>No carol of love from a song-bird 's throat ; the world lies naked and still , For all things tender , and all things sweet , have been touched by the gruesome chill .</p>
   <p>Not a flower — a blue forget-me-not , a wild rose , or jasmine soft — To lay its bloom on the dead river 's lips , that have kissed them all so oft .</p>
   <p>But look ! a ladder is spanning the space ‘ twixt earth and the sky beyond , A ladder of gold for the Maid of Grace — the strong , the subtle , the fond !</p>
   <p>Spring , with the warmth in her footsteps light , and the breeze and the fragrant breath , Is coming to press her radiant face to that which is cold in death .</p>
   <p>Spring , with a mantle made of the gold held close in a sunbeam 's heart Thrown over her shoulders bonnie and bare — see the sap in the great trees start !</p>
   <p>Where the hem of this flowing garment trails , see the glow , the color bright , A stirring and spreading of something fair — the dawn is chasing the night !</p>
   <p>Spring , with all love and all dear delights pulsing in every vein , The old earth knows her , and thrills to her touch , as she claims her own again .</p>
   <p>Spring , with the hyacinths filling her lap and violet seeds in her hair , With the crocus hiding its satin head in her bosom warm and fair ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Spring , with the daffodils at her feet and pansies abloom in her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Spring , with enough of God in herself to make the dead to arise !</l>

     <l n="2">The hills , the high , far-reaching Sussex hills ?</l>
     <l n="3">Above , the straggling flocks of fleecy clouds</l>

     <l n="60">Rubbed out with careless hand the lettering :</l>
