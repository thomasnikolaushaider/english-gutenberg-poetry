       <l n="3">The bow was made in England :</l>
       <l n="4">Of true wood , of yew-wood ,</l>
       <l n="5">The wood of English bows ;</l>

      <head>CREMONA</head>
      <note>The French Army , including a part of the Irish Brigade , under Marshal Villeroy , held the fortified town of Cremona during the winter of 1702 . Prince Eugene , with the Imperial Army , surprised it one morning , and , owing to the treachery of a priest , occupied the whole city before the alarm was given . Villeroy was captured , together with many of the French garrison . The Irish , however , consisting of the regiments of Dillon and of Burke , held a fort commanding the river gate , and defended themselves all day , in spite of Prince Eugene 's efforts to win them over to his cause . Eventually Eugene , being unable to take the post , was compelled to withdraw from the city .</note>

       <l n="1">The Grenadiers of Austria are proper men and tall ;</l>
       <l n="2">The Grenadiers of Austria have scaled the city wall ;</l>
       <l n="3">They have marched from far away</l>
       <l n="4">Ere the dawning of the day ,</l>
       <l n="5">And the morning saw them masters of Cremona .</l>

       <l n="8">They have crept up every street ,</l>
       <l n="9">In the market-place they meet ,</l>
       <l n="10">They are holding every vantage in Cremona .</l>
      </lg>

       <l n="11">The Marshal Villeroy he has started from his bed ;</l>

       <l n="16">Prince Eugene of Austria is in the market-place ;</l>

       <l n="19">For the Citadel is won ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the black and yellow flag flies o'er Cremona . ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">Major Dan O'Mahony is in the barrack square ,</l>
       <l n="22">And just six hundred Irish lads are waiting for him there ;</l>
       <l n="23">Says he , ‘ Come in your shirt ,</l>
       <l n="24">And you wo n't take any hurt ,</l>
       <l n="25">For the morning air is pleasant in Cremona . ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Major Dan O'Mahony is at the barrack gate ,</l>

       <l n="28">There 's Dillon and there 's Burke ,</l>
       <l n="29">And there 'll be some bloody work</l>
       <l n="30">Ere the Kaiserlics shall boast they hold Cremona .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="31">Major Dan O'Mahony has reached the river fort ,</l>
       <l n="32">And just six hundred Irish lads are joining in the sport ;</l>
       <l n="33">‘ Come , take a hand ! ’ says he ,</l>
       <l n="34">‘ And if you will stand by me ,</l>
       <l n="35">Then it 's glory to the man who takes Cremona ! ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="36">Prince Eugene of Austria has frowns upon his face ,</l>
       <l n="37">And loud he calls his Galloper of Irish blood and race :</l>
       <l n="38">‘ MacDonnell , ride , I pray ,</l>
       <l n="39">To your countrymen , and say</l>
       <l n="40">That only they are left in all Cremona ! ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="41">MacDonnell he has reined his mare beside the river dyke ,</l>
       <l n="42">And he has tied the parley flag upon a sergeant 's pike ;</l>
       <l n="43">Six companies were there</l>
       <l n="44">From Limerick and Clare ,</l>
       <l n="45">The last of all the guardians of Cremona .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="46">‘ Now , Major Dan O'Mahony , give up the river gate ,</l>
       <l n="47">Or , Major Dan O'Mahony , you 'll find it is too late ;</l>
       <l n="48">For when I gallop back</l>
       <l n="49">‘ Tis the signal for attack ,</l>
       <l n="50">And no quarter for the Irish in Cremona ! ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="51">And Major Dan he laughed : ‘ Faith , if what you say be true ,</l>
       <l n="52">And if they will not come until they hear again from you ,</l>
       <l n="53">Then there will be no attack ,</l>
       <l n="54">For you 're never going back ,</l>
       <l n="55">And we 'll keep you snug and safely in Cremona . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="56">All the weary day the German stormers came ,</l>
       <l n="57">All the weary day they were faced by fire and flame ,</l>
       <l n="58">They have filled the ditch with dead ,</l>
       <l n="59">And the river 's running red ;</l>
       <l n="60">But they cannot win the gateway of Cremona .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="61">All the weary day , again , again , again ,</l>
       <l n="62">The horsemen of Dupres and the footmen of Lorraine ,</l>
       <l n="63">Taafe and Herberstein ,</l>
       <l n="64">And the riders of the Rhine ;</l>
       <l n="65">It 's a mighty price they 're paying for Cremona .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="66">Time and time they came with the deep-mouthed German roar ,</l>
       <l n="67">Time and time they broke like the wave upon the shore ;</l>
       <l n="68">For better men were there</l>
       <l n="69">From Limerick and Clare ,</l>
       <l n="70">And who will take the gateway of Cremona ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="71">Prince Eugene has watched , and he gnaws his nether lip ;</l>
       <l n="72">Prince Eugene has cursed as he saw his chances slip :</l>
       <l n="73">‘ Call off ! Call off ! ’ he cried ,</l>
       <l n="74">‘ It is nearing eventide ,</l>
       <l n="75">And I fear our work is finished in Cremona . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="76">Says Wauchop to McAulliffe , ‘ Their fire is growing slack . ’</l>
       <l n="77">Says Major Dan O'Mahony , ‘ It is their last attack ;</l>
       <l n="78">But who will stop the game</l>
       <l n="79">While there 's light to play the same ,</l>
       <l n="80">And to walk a short way with them from Cremona ? ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="81">And so they snarl behind them , and beg them turn and come ,</l>
       <l n="82">They have taken Neuberg 's standard , they have taken Diak 's drum ;</l>
       <l n="83">And along the winding Po ,</l>
       <l n="84">Beard on shoulder , stern and slow</l>
       <l n="85">The Kaiserlics are riding from Cremona .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="86">Just two hundred Irish lads are shouting on the wall ;</l>
       <l n="87">Four hundred more are lying who can hear no slogan call ;</l>
       <l n="88">But what 's the odds of that ,</l>
       <l n="89">For it 's all the same to Pat</l>
       <l n="90">If he pays his debt in Dublin or Cremona .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="91">Says General de Vaudray , ‘ You 've done a soldier 's work !</l>
       <l n="92">And every tongue in France shall talk of Dillon and of Burke !</l>
       <l n="93">Ask what you will this day ,</l>
       <l n="94">And be it what it may ,</l>
       <l n="95">It is granted to the heroes of Cremona . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="96">‘ Why , then , ’ says Dan O'Mahony , ‘ one favour we entreat ,</l>
       <l n="97">We were called a little early , and our toilet 's not complete .</l>
       <l n="98">We 've no quarrel with the shirt ,</l>
       <l n="99">But the breeches would n't hurt ,</l>

       <l n="5">Two of McPherson 's flanking corps</l>
       <l n="6">Across the Desert were tramping .</l>
       <l n="7">They had wandered off from the beaten track</l>
       <l n="8">And now were wearily harking back ,</l>
       <l n="9">Ever staring round for the signal jack</l>

       <l n="11">‘ E looked a puffeck pictur , and a pictur ‘ e would stay ,</l>

       <l n="21">I seed it in the stable yard — it fairly turned me sick -</l>
       <l n="22">A greasy , wheezy engine as can neither buck nor kick .</l>
       <l n="23">You 've a screw to drive it forrard , and a screw to make it stop ,</l>
       <l n="24">For it was foaled in a smithy stove an ’ bred in a blacksmith shop .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">It did n't want no stable , it did n't ask no groom ,</l>

       <l n="27">Just fill it up with paraffin an ’ it would go all day ,</l>
       <l n="28">Which the same should be agin the law if I could ‘ ave my way .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">Well , master took ‘ is motor-car , an ’ moted ‘ ere an ’ there ,</l>
       <l n="30">A frightenin ’ the ‘ orses an ’ a poisonin ’ the air .</l>
       <l n="31">‘ E wore a bloomin ’ yachtin ’ cap , but Lor ’ ! wot DID ‘ e know ,</l>

       <l n="33">An ’ then one day it would n't go . ‘ E screwed and screwed again ,</l>

       <l n="36">It ‘ urt ‘ is pride most cruel , but what was ‘ e to do ?</l>
       <l n="37">So at last ‘ e bade me fetch a ‘ orse to pull the motor through .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="38">This was the ‘ orse we fetched ‘ im ; an ’ when we reached the car ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="42">Not bad tempered , mind you , but kind of pained and vexed ,</l>
       <l n="43">And ‘ e seemed to say , ‘ Well , bli ’ me ! wot WILL they ask me next ?</l>
       <l n="44">I 've put up with some liberties , but this caps all by far ,</l>
       <l n="45">To be assistant engine to a crocky motor-car ! ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="46">Well , master ‘ e was in the car , a-fiddlin ’ with the gear ,</l>
       <l n="47">And the ‘ orse was meditatin ’ , an ’ I was standin ’ near ,</l>
       <l n="48">When master ‘ e touched somethin ’ — what it was we 'll never know -</l>
       <l n="49">But it sort o ’ spurred the boiler up and made the engine go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="50">‘'Old ‘ ard , old gal ! ’ says master , and ‘ Gently then ! ’ says I ,</l>
       <l n="51">But an engine wo n't ‘ eed coaxin ’ an ’ it ai n't no use to try ;</l>
       <l n="52">So first ‘ e pulled a lever , an ’ then ‘ e turned a screw ,</l>
       <l n="53">But the thing kept crawlin ’ forrard spite of all that ‘ e could do .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="54">And first it went quite slowly and the ‘ orse went also slow ,</l>
       <l n="55">But ‘ e ‘ ad to buck up faster when the wheels began to go ;</l>
       <l n="56">For the car kept crowdin ’ on ‘ im and buttin ’ ‘ im along ,</l>
       <l n="57">And in less than ‘ alf a minute , sir , that ‘ orse was goin ’ strong .</l>
      </lg>

       <l n="58">At first ‘ e walked quite dignified , an ’ then ‘ e ‘ ad to trot ,</l>

       <l n="60">‘ E looked ‘ is very ‘ aughtiest , as if ‘ e did n't ‘ e mind ,</l>

       <l n="62">Now , master lost ‘ is ‘ ead when ‘ e found ‘ e could n't stop ,</l>

       <l n="73">Till ‘ e broke the ten-mile record , same as I already said .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="74">Ten mile in twenty minutes ! ‘ E done it , sir . That 's true .</l>

       <l n="76">Some say it was n't ‘ ardly fair , and the papers made a fuss ,</l>

       <l n="80">That engine wore it off ‘ im before master made it stop ,</l>
