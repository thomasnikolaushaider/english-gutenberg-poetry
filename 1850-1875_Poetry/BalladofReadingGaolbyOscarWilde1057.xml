    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">To drift with every passion till my soul</l>
     <l n="2">Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play ,</l>
     <l n="3">Is it for this that I have given away</l>
     <l n="4">Mine ancient wisdom , and austere control ?</l>
     <l n="5">Methinks my life is a twice-written scroll</l>
     <l n="6">Scrawled over on some boyish holiday</l>
     <l n="7">With idle songs for pipe and virelay ,</l>
     <l n="8">Which do but mar the secret of the whole .</l>
     <l n="9">Surely there was a time I might have trod</l>
     <l n="10">The sunlit heights , and from life 's dissonance</l>
     <l n="11">Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God :</l>
     <l n="12">Is that time dead ? lo ! with a little rod</l>
     <l n="13">I did but touch the honey of romance —</l>
     <l n="14">And must I lose a soul 's inheritance ?</l>

     <l n="16">Not that I love thy children , whose dull eyes</l>
     <l n="17">See nothing save their own unlovely woe ,</l>
     <l n="18">Whose minds know nothing , nothing care to know ,—</l>
     <l n="19">But that the roar of thy Democracies ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thy reigns of Terror , thy great Anarchies ,</l>
     <l n="21">Mirror my wildest passions like the sea</l>
     <l n="22">And give my rage a brother —! Liberty !</l>
     <l n="23">For this sake only do thy dissonant cries</l>
     <l n="24">Delight my discreet soul , else might all kings</l>
     <l n="25">By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades</l>
     <l n="26">Rob nations of their rights inviolate</l>
     <l n="27">And I remain unmoved — and yet , and yet ,</l>
     <l n="28">These Christs that die upon the barricades ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="35">The earth , a brittle globe of glass ,</l>
     <l n="36">Lies in the hollow of thy hand ,</l>
     <l n="37">And through its heart of crystal pass ,</l>
     <l n="38">Like shadows through a twilight land ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="39">The spears of crimson-suited war ,</l>
     <l n="40">The long white-crested waves of fight ,</l>

     <l n="43">The yellow leopards , strained and lean ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="47">The strong sea-lion of England 's wars</l>

     <l n="49">To battle with the storm that mars</l>
     <l n="50">The stars of England 's chivalry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="51">The brazen-throated clarion blows</l>
     <l n="52">Across the Pathan 's reedy fen ,</l>
     <l n="53">And the high steeps of Indian snows</l>
     <l n="54">Shake to the tread of armed men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="55">And many an Afghan chief , who lies</l>
     <l n="56">Beneath his cool pomegranate-trees ,</l>
     <l n="57">Clutches his sword in fierce surmise</l>
     <l n="58">When on the mountain-side he sees</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="59">The fleet-foot Marri scout , who comes</l>
     <l n="60">To tell how he hath heard afar</l>
     <l n="61">The measured roll of English drums</l>
     <l n="62">Beat at the gates of Kandahar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="63">For southern wind and east wind meet</l>

     <l n="65">England with bare and bloody feet</l>
     <l n="66">Climbs the steep road of wide empire .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="67">O lonely Himalayan height ,</l>
     <l n="68">Grey pillar of the Indian sky ,</l>

     <l n="70">Our winged dogs of Victory ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="71">The almond-groves of Samarcand ,</l>
     <l n="72">Bokhara , where red lilies blow ,</l>
     <l n="73">And Oxus , by whose yellow sand</l>
     <l n="74">The grave white-turbaned merchants go :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="75">And on from thence to Ispahan ,</l>
     <l n="76">The gilded garden of the sun ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="79">And that dread city of Cabool</l>

     <l n="82">With water for the noonday heat :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="83">Where through the narrow straight Bazaar</l>
     <l n="84">A little maid Circassian</l>
     <l n="85">Is led , a present from the Czar</l>
     <l n="86">Unto some old and bearded khan ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="87">Here have our wild war-eagles flown ,</l>
     <l n="88">And flapped wide wings in fiery fight ;</l>
     <l n="89">But the sad dove , that sits alone</l>
     <l n="90">In England — she hath no delight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="91">In vain the laughing girl will lean</l>
     <l n="92">To greet her love with love-lit eyes :</l>
     <l n="93">Down in some treacherous black ravine ,</l>
     <l n="94">Clutching his flag , the dead boy lies .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="95">And many a moon and sun will see</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="99">Pale women who have lost their lord</l>
     <l n="100">Will kiss the relics of the slain —</l>
     <l n="101">Some tarnished epaulette — some sword —</l>
     <l n="102">Poor toys to soothe such anguished pain .</l>

     <l n="103">For not in quiet English fields</l>

     <l n="106">With all the flowers the dead love best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="107">For some are by the Delhi walls ,</l>
     <l n="108">And many in the Afghan land ,</l>

     <l n="110">Through seven mouths of shifting sand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="111">And some in Russian waters lie ,</l>

     <l n="114">The wind-swept heights of Trafalgar .</l>

   <p>Sweet , I blame you not , for mine the fault was , had I not been made of common clay I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed yet , seen the fuller air , the larger day .</p>
   <p>From the wildness of my wasted passion I had struck a better , clearer song , Lit some lighter light of freer freedom , battled with some Hydra-headed wrong .</p>
   <p>Had my lips been smitten into music by the kisses that but made them bleed , You had walked with Bice and the angels on that verdant and enamelled mead .</p>
   <p>I had trod the road which Dante treading saw the suns of seven circles shine , Ay ! perchance had seen the heavens opening , as they opened to the Florentine .</p>
   <p>And the mighty nations would have crowned me , who am crownless now and without name , And some orient dawn had found me kneeling on the threshold of the House of Fame .</p>
   <p>I had sat within that marble circle where the oldest bard is as the young , And the pipe is ever dropping honey , and the lyre 's strings are ever strung .</p>
   <p>Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out the poppy-seeded wine , With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead , clasped the hand of noble love in mine .</p>
   <p>And at springtide , when the apple-blossoms brush the burnished bosom of the dove , Two young lovers lying in an orchard would have read the story of our love .</p>
   <p>Would have read the legend of my passion , known the bitter secret of my heart , Kissed as we have kissed , but never parted as we two are fated now to part .</p>
   <p>For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by the cankerworm of truth , And no hand can gather up the fallen withered petals of the rose of youth .</p>
   <p>Yet I am not sorry that I loved you — ah ! what else had I a boy to do ,— For the hungry teeth of time devour , and the silent-footed years pursue .</p>
   <p>Rudderless , we drift athwart a tempest , and when once the storm of youth is past , Without lyre , without lute or chorus , Death the silent pilot comes at last .</p>
   <p>And within the grave there is no pleasure , for the blindworm battens on the root , And Desire shudders into ashes , and the tree of Passion bears no fruit .</p>
   <p>Ah ! what else had I to do but love you , God 's own mother was less dear to me , And less dear the Cytheraean rising like an argent lily from the sea .</p>
   <p>I have made my choice , have lived my poems , and , though youth is gone in wasted days , I have found the lover 's crown of myrtle better than the poet 's crown of bays .</p>

     <lg type="stanza" n="122">
      <l n="452">( To Marcel Schwob in friendship and in admiration )</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In a dim corner of my room for longer than my fancy thinks A beautiful and silent Sphinx has watched me through the shifting gloom .</p>
   <p>Inviolate and immobile she does not rise she does not stir For silver moons are naught to her and naught to her the suns that reel .</p>
   <p>Red follows grey across the air , the waves of moonlight ebb and flow But with the Dawn she does not go and in the night-time she is there .</p>
   <p>Dawn follows Dawn and Nights grow old and all the while this curious cat Lies couching on the Chinese mat with eyes of satin rimmed with gold .</p>
   <p>Upon the mat she lies and leers and on the tawny throat of her Flutters the soft and silky fur or ripples to her pointed ears .</p>
   <p>Come forth , my lovely seneschal ! so somnolent , so statuesque ! Come forth you exquisite grotesque ! half woman and half animal !</p>
   <p>Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx ! and put your head upon my knee ! And let me stroke your throat and see your body spotted like the Lynx !</p>
   <p>And let me touch those curving claws of yellow ivory and grasp The tail that like a monstrous Asp coils round your heavy velvet paws !</p>
   <p>A thousand weary centuries are thine while I have hardly seen Some twenty summers cast their green for Autumn 's gaudy liveries .</p>
   <p>But you can read the Hieroglyphs on the great sandstone obelisks , And you have talked with Basilisks , and you have looked on Hippogriffs .</p>
   <p>O tell me , were you standing by when Isis to Osiris knelt ? And did you watch the Egyptian melt her union for Antony</p>
   <p>And drink the jewel-drunken wine and bend her head in mimic awe To see the huge proconsul draw the salted tunny from the brine ?</p>
   <p>And did you mark the Cyprian kiss white Adon on his catafalque ? And did you follow Amenalk , the God of Heliopolis ?</p>
   <p>And did you talk with Thoth , and did you hear the moon-horned Io weep ? And know the painted kings who sleep beneath the wedge-shaped Pyramid ?</p>
   <p>Lift up your large black satin eyes which are like cushions where one sinks ! Fawn at my feet , fantastic Sphinx ! and sing me all your memories !</p>
   <p>Sing to me of the Jewish maid who wandered with the Holy Child , And how you led them through the wild , and how they slept beneath your shade .</p>
   <p>Sing to me of that odorous green eve when crouching by the marge You heard from Adrian 's gilded barge the laughter of Antinous</p>
   <p>And lapped the stream and fed your drouth and watched with hot and hungry stare The ivory body of that rare young slave with his pomegranate mouth !</p>
   <p>Sing to me of the Labyrinth in which the twi - formed bull was stalled ! Sing to me of the night you crawled across the temple 's granite plinth</p>
   <p>When through the purple corridors the screaming scarlet Ibis flew In terror , and a horrid dew dripped from the moaning Mandragores ,</p>
   <p>And the great torpid crocodile within the tank shed slimy tears , And tare the jewels from his ears and staggered back into the Nile ,</p>
   <p>And the priests cursed you with shrill psalms as in your claws you seized their snake And crept away with it to slake your passion by the shuddering palms .</p>
   <p>Who were your lovers ? who were they who wrestled for you in the dust ? Which was the vessel of your Lust ? What Leman had you , every day ?</p>
   <p>Did giant Lizards come and crouch before you on the reedy banks ? Did Gryphons with great metal flanks leap on you in your trampled couch ?</p>
   <p>Did monstrous hippopotami come sidling toward you in the mist ? Did gilt-scaled dragons writhe and twist with passion as you passed them by ?</p>
   <p>And from the brick-built Lycian tomb what horrible Chimera came With fearful heads and fearful flame to breed new wonders from your womb ?</p>
   <p>Or had you shameful secret quests and did you harry to your home Some Nereid coiled in amber foam with curious rock crystal breasts ?</p>
   <p>Or did you treading through the froth call to the brown Sidonian For tidings of Leviathan , Leviathan or Behemoth ?</p>
   <p>Or did you when the sun was set climb up the cactus-covered slope To meet your swarthy Ethiop whose body was of polished jet ?</p>
   <p>Or did you while the earthen skiffs dropped down the grey Nilotic flats At twilight and the flickering bats flew round the temple 's triple glyphs</p>
   <p>Steal to the border of the bar and swim across the silent lake And slink into the vault and make the Pyramid your lupanar</p>
   <p>Till from each black sarcophagus rose up the painted swathed dead ? Or did you lure unto your bed the ivory-horned Tragelaphos ?</p>
   <p>Or did you love the god of flies who plagued the Hebrews and was splashed With wine unto the waist ? or Pasht , who had green beryls for her eyes ?</p>
   <p>Or that young god , the Tyrian , who was more amorous than the dove Of Ashtaroth ? or did you love the god of the Assyrian</p>
   <p>Whose wings , like strange transparent talc , rose high above his hawk-faced head , Painted with silver and with red and ribbed with rods of Oreichalch ?</p>
   <p>Or did huge Apis from his car leap down and lay before your feet Big blossoms of the honey-sweet and honey - coloured nenuphar ?</p>
   <p>How subtle-secret is your smile ! Did you love none then ? Nay , I know Great Ammon was your bedfellow ! He lay with you beside the Nile !</p>
   <p>The river-horses in the slime trumpeted when they saw him come Odorous with Syrian galbanum and smeared with spikenard and with thyme .</p>
   <p>He came along the river bank like some tall galley argent-sailed , He strode across the waters , mailed in beauty , and the waters sank .</p>
   <p>He strode across the desert sand : he reached the valley where you lay : He waited till the dawn of day : then touched your black breasts with his hand .</p>
   <p>You kissed his mouth with mouths of flame : you made the horned god your own : You stood behind him on his throne : you called him by his secret name .</p>
   <p>You whispered monstrous oracles into the caverns of his ears : With blood of goats and blood of steers you taught him monstrous miracles .</p>
   <p>White Ammon was your bedfellow ! Your chamber was the steaming Nile ! And with your curved archaic smile you watched his passion come and go .</p>
   <p>With Syrian oils his brows were bright : and wide-spread as a tent at noon His marble limbs made pale the moon and lent the day a larger light .</p>
   <p>His long hair was nine cubits ’ span and coloured like that yellow gem Which hidden in their garment 's hem the merchants bring from Kurdistan .</p>
   <p>His face was as the must that lies upon a vat of new-made wine : The seas could not insapphirine the perfect azure of his eyes .</p>
   <p>His thick soft throat was white as milk and threaded with thin veins of blue : And curious pearls like frozen dew were broidered on his flowing silk .</p>
   <p>On pearl and porphyry pedestalled he was too bright to look upon : For on his ivory breast there shone the wondrous ocean-emerald ,</p>
   <p>That mystic moonlit jewel which some diver of the Colchian caves Had found beneath the blackening waves and carried to the Colchian witch .</p>
   <p>Before his gilded galiot ran naked vine-wreathed corybants , And lines of swaying elephants knelt down to draw his chariot ,</p>
   <p>And lines of swarthy Nubians bare up his litter as he rode Down the great granite-paven road between the nodding peacock-fans .</p>
   <p>The merchants brought him steatite from Sidon in their painted ships : The meanest cup that touched his lips was fashioned from a chrysolite .</p>
   <p>The merchants brought him cedar chests of rich apparel bound with cords : His train was borne by Memphian lords : young kings were glad to be his guests .</p>
   <p>Ten hundred shaven priests did bow to Ammon 's altar day and night , Ten hundred lamps did wave their light through Ammon 's carven house — and now</p>
   <p>Foul snake and speckled adder with their young ones crawl from stone to stone For ruined is the house and prone the great rose-marble monolith !</p>
   <p>Wild ass or trotting jackal comes and couches in the mouldering gates : Wild satyrs call unto their mates across the fallen fluted drums .</p>
   <p>And on the summit of the pile the blue-faced ape of Horus sits And gibbers while the fig-tree splits the pillars of the peristyle</p>
   <p>The god is scattered here and there : deep hidden in the windy sand I saw his giant granite hand still clenched in impotent despair .</p>
   <p>And many a wandering caravan of stately negroes silken-shawled , Crossing the desert , halts appalled before the neck that none can span .</p>
   <p>And many a bearded Bedouin draws back his yellow-striped burnous To gaze upon the Titan thews of him who was thy paladin .</p>
   <p>Go , seek his fragments on the moor and wash them in the evening dew , And from their pieces make anew thy mutilated paramour !</p>
   <p>Go , seek them where they lie alone and from their broken pieces make Thy bruised bedfellow ! And wake mad passions in the senseless stone !</p>
   <p>Charm his dull ear with Syrian hymns ! he loved your body ! oh , be kind , Pour spikenard on his hair , and wind soft rolls of linen round his limbs !</p>
   <p>Wind round his head the figured coins ! stain with red fruits those pallid lips ! Weave purple for his shrunken hips ! and purple for his barren loins !</p>
   <p>Away to Egypt ! Have no fear . Only one God has ever died . Only one God has let His side be wounded by a soldier 's spear .</p>
   <p>But these , thy lovers , are not dead . Still by the hundred-cubit gate Dog-faced Anubis sits in state with lotus-lilies for thy head .</p>
   <p>Still from his chair of porphyry gaunt Memnon strains his lidless eyes Across the empty land , and cries each yellow morning unto thee .</p>
   <p>And Nilus with his broken horn lies in his black and oozy bed And till thy coming will not spread his waters on the withering corn .</p>
   <p>Your lovers are not dead , I know . They will rise up and hear your voice And clash their cymbals and rejoice and run to kiss your mouth ! And so ,</p>
   <p>Set wings upon your argosies ! Set horses to your ebon car ! Back to your Nile ! Or if you are grown sick of dead divinities</p>
   <p>Follow some roving lion 's spoor across the copper - coloured plain , Reach out and hale him by the mane and bid him be your paramour !</p>
   <p>Couch by his side upon the grass and set your white teeth in his throat And when you hear his dying note lash your long flanks of polished brass</p>
   <p>And take a tiger for your mate , whose amber sides are flecked with black , And ride upon his gilded back in triumph through the Theban gate ,</p>
   <p>And toy with him in amorous jests , and when he turns , and snarls , and gnaws , O smite him with your jasper claws ! and bruise him with your agate breasts !</p>
   <p>Why are you tarrying ? Get hence ! I weary of your sullen ways , I weary of your steadfast gaze , your somnolent magnificence .</p>
   <p>Your horrible and heavy breath makes the light flicker in the lamp , And on my brow I feel the damp and dreadful dews of night and death .</p>
   <p>Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake , Your tongue is like a scarlet snake that dances to fantastic tunes ,</p>
   <p>Your pulse makes poisonous melodies , and your black throat is like the hole Left by some torch or burning coal on Saracenic tapestries .</p>
   <p>Away ! The sulphur-coloured stars are hurrying through the Western gate ! Away ! Or it may be too late to climb their silent silver cars !</p>
   <p>See , the dawn shivers round the grey gilt-dialled towers , and the rain Streams down each diamonded pane and blurs with tears the wannish day .</p>
   <p>What snake-tressed fury fresh from Hell , with uncouth gestures and unclean , Stole from the poppy-drowsy queen and led you to a student 's cell ?</p>
   <p>What songless tongueless ghost of sin crept through the curtains of the night , And saw my taper burning bright , and knocked , and bade you enter in ?</p>
   <p>Are there not others more accursed , whiter with leprosies than I ? Are Abana and Pharphar dry that you come here to slake your thirst ?</p>
   <p>Get hence , you loathsome mystery ! Hideous animal , get hence ! You wake in me each bestial sense , you make me what I would not be .</p>
   <p>You make my creed a barren sham , you wake foul dreams of sensual life , And Atys with his blood-stained knife were better than the thing I am .</p>
   <p>False Sphinx ! False Sphinx ! By reedy Styx old Charon , leaning on his oar , Waits for my coin . Go thou before , and leave me to my crucifix ,</p>
   <p>Whose pallid burden , sick with pain , watches the world with wearied eyes , And weeps for every soul that dies , and weeps for every soul in vain .</p>
