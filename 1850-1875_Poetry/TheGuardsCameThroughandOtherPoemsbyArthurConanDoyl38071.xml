       <l n="2">Men of the Twenty-first ,</l>
       <l n="3">Up by the Chalk Pit Wood ,</l>
       <l n="4">Weak from our wounds and our thirst ,</l>
       <l n="5">Wanting our sleep and our food</l>
       <l n="6">After a day and a night .</l>
       <l n="7">God ! shall I ever forget ?</l>
       <l n="8">Beaten and broke in the fight ,</l>
       <l n="9">But sticking it , sticking it yet ,</l>
       <l n="10">Trying to hold the line ,</l>
       <l n="11">Fainting and spent and done ;</l>
       <l n="12">Always the thud and the whine ,</l>
       <l n="13">Always the yell of the Hun .</l>
       <l n="14">Northumberland , Lancaster , York ,</l>
       <l n="15">Durham and Somerset ,</l>
       <l n="16">Fighting alone , worn to the bone ,</l>
       <l n="17">But sticking it , sticking it yet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="18">Never a message of hope ,</l>
       <l n="19">Never a word of cheer ,</l>
       <l n="20">Fronting Hill 70 's shell-swept slope ,</l>
       <l n="21">With the dull , dead plain in our rear ;</l>
       <l n="22">Always the shriek of the shell ,</l>
       <l n="23">Always the roar of the burst ,</l>
       <l n="24">Always the tortures of Hell ,</l>
       <l n="25">As waiting and wincing we cursed</l>
       <l n="26">Our luck , the guns , and the Boche .</l>
       <l n="27">When our Corporal shouted “ Stand to ! ”</l>
       <l n="28">And I hear some one cry , “ Clear the front for the Guards ! ” —</l>
       <l n="29">And the Guards came through .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="30">Our throats they were parched and hot ,</l>
       <l n="31">But , Lord ! if you 'd heard the cheer ,</l>
       <l n="32">Irish , Welsh and Scot ,</l>
       <l n="33">Coldstream and Grenadier —</l>
       <l n="34">Two Brigades , if you please ,</l>
       <l n="35">Dressing as straight as a hem .</l>
       <l n="36">We , we were down on our knees ,</l>
       <l n="37">Praying for us and for them ,</l>
       <l n="38">Praying with tear-wet cheek ,</l>
       <l n="39">Praying with outstretched hand .</l>
       <l n="40">Lord ! I could speak for a week ,</l>
       <l n="41">But how could you understand ?</l>
       <l n="42">How could your cheeks be wet ?</l>
       <l n="43">Such feelin 's do n't come to you ;</l>
       <l n="44">But how can me or my mates forget</l>
       <l n="45">How the Guards came through ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="46">“ Five yards left extend ! ”</l>

       <l n="48">And line after line , with never a bend ,</l>
       <l n="49">And a touch of the London swank .</l>
       <l n="50">A trifle of swank and dash ,</l>
       <l n="51">Cool as a home parade ,</l>
       <l n="52">Twinkle , glitter and flash ,</l>
       <l n="53">Flinching never a shade ,</l>
       <l n="54">With the shrapnel right in their face ,</l>
       <l n="55">Doing their Hyde Park stunt ,</l>
       <l n="56">Swinging along at an easy pace ,</l>
       <l n="57">Arms at the trail , eyes front .</l>
       <l n="58">Man ! it was great to see !</l>
       <l n="59">Man ! it was great to do !</l>
       <l n="60">It 's a cot , and a hospital ward for me ,</l>
       <l n="61">But I 'll tell them in Blighty wherever I be ,</l>

       <l n="4">Her heart rose high to the foeman 's hate ,</l>

       <l n="11">Austere and cold as an ice-cave 's light —</l>

       <l n="16">Her passion cry was the scathe she wrought ,</l>

       <l n="22">Sad sky above , sad earth beneath ,</l>
       <l n="23">She walked with God in the Vale of Death —</l>

       <l n="2">In the first wild spate of the German flood ,</l>
       <l n="3">And paid full price with their heart 's best blood</l>
       <l n="4">For the saving of you and me :</l>

       <l n="11">On the deadly curve of the Ypres hell ,</l>
       <l n="12">Barring the coast to the last ?</l>
       <l n="13">Where are our laddies who died out there ,</l>
       <l n="14">From Poelcapelle to Festubert ,</l>
       <l n="15">When the days grew short and the poplars bare</l>

       <l n="20">The cold that cramped and froze ;</l>
       <l n="21">The weary night , the chill bleak day ,</l>
       <l n="22">When earth was dark and sky was grey ,</l>

      <head>THE GUNS IN SUSSEX</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Light green of grass and richer green of bush</l>
       <l n="2">Slope upwards to the darkest green of fir .</l>
       <l n="3">How still ! How deathly still ! And yet the hush</l>
       <l n="4">Shivers and trembles with some subtle stir ,</l>
       <l n="5">Some far-off throbbing like a muffled drum ,</l>
       <l n="6">Beaten in broken rhythm oversea ,</l>
       <l n="7">To play the last funereal march of some</l>
       <l n="8">Who die to-day that Europe may be free .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">The deep-blue heaven , curving from the green ,</l>
       <l n="10">Spans with its shimmering arch the flowery zone ;</l>
       <l n="11">In all God 's earth there is no gentler scene ,</l>
       <l n="12">And yet I hear that awesome monotone .</l>
       <l n="13">Above the circling midge 's piping shrill ,</l>
       <l n="14">And the long droning of the questing bee ,</l>
       <l n="15">Above all sultry summer sounds , it still</l>
       <l n="16">Mutters its ceaseless menaces to me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">And as I listen , all the garden fair</l>
       <l n="18">Darkens to plains of misery and death ,</l>
       <l n="19">And , looking past the roses , I see there</l>
       <l n="20">Those sordid furrows with the rising breath</l>
       <l n="21">Of all things foul and black . My heart is hot</l>
       <l n="22">Within me as I view it , and I cry ,</l>
       <l n="23">“ Better the misery of these men 's lot</l>
       <l n="24">Than all the peace that comes to such as I ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">And strange that in the pauses of the sound</l>
       <l n="26">I hear the children 's laughter as they roam ,</l>
       <l n="27">And then their mother calls , and all around</l>
       <l n="28">Rise up the gentle murmurs of a home .</l>
       <l n="29">But still I gaze afar , and at the sight</l>
       <l n="30">My whole soul softens to its heart-felt prayer ,</l>
       <l n="31">“ Spirit of Justice , Thou for whom they fight ,</l>
       <l n="32">Ah , turn in mercy to our lads out there !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">“ The froward peoples have deserved Thy wrath ,</l>
       <l n="34">And on them is the Judgment as of old ,</l>
       <l n="35">But if they wandered from the hallowed path</l>
       <l n="36">Yet is their retribution manifold .</l>
       <l n="37">Behold all Europe writhing on the rack ,</l>

      <head>YPRES</head>
      <head>SEPTEMBER , 1915</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Push on , my Lord of Wuertemberg , across the Flemish Fen !</l>
       <l n="2">See where the lure of Ypres calls you !</l>
       <l n="3">There 's just one ragged British line of Plumer 's weary men ;</l>
       <l n="4">It 's true they held you off before , but venture it again ,</l>
       <l n="5">Come , try your luck , whatever fate befalls you !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">You 've been some little time , my Lord . Perhaps you scarce remember</l>
       <l n="7">The far-off early days of that resistance .</l>
       <l n="8">Was it in October last ? Or was it in November ?</l>
       <l n="9">And now the leaves are turning and you stand in mid-September</l>
       <l n="10">Still staring at the Belfry in the distance .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Can you recall the fateful day — a day of drifting skies ,</l>
       <l n="12">When you started on the famous Calais onset ?</l>
       <l n="13">Can it be the War-Lord blundered when he urged the enterprise ?</l>
       <l n="14">For surely it 's a weary while since first before your eyes</l>
       <l n="15">That old Belfry rose against the sunset .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">You held council at your quarters when the budding Alexanders</l>
       <l n="17">And the Pickel-haubed Caesars gave their reasons .</l>
       <l n="18">Was there one amongst that bristle-headed circle of commanders</l>
       <l n="19">Ever ventured the opinion that a little town of Flanders</l>
       <l n="20">Would hold you pounded here through all the seasons ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">You all clasped hands upon it . You would break the British line ,</l>
       <l n="22">You would smash a road to westward with your host ,</l>
       <l n="23">The howitzers should thunder and the Uhlan lances shine</l>
       <l n="24">Till Calais heard the blaring of the distant “ Wacht am Rhein , ”</l>
       <l n="25">As you topped the grassy uplands of the coast .</l>
       <l n="26">Said the Graf von Feuer-Essen , “ It 's a fact beyond discussion ,</l>
       <l n="27">That man to man we can outfight the foe .</l>
       <l n="28">There is valour in the French , there is patience in the Russian ,</l>
       <l n="29">But blend all war-like virtues and you get the lordly Prussian , ”</l>
       <l n="30">And the bristle-headed murmured , “ Das ist so . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">“ And the British , ” cried another , “ they are mercenary cattle ,</l>
       <l n="32">Without one noble impulse of the soul ,</l>
       <l n="33">Degenerate and drunken ; if the dollars chink and rattle ,</l>
       <l n="34">‘ Tis the only sort of music that will call them to the battle . ”</l>
       <l n="35">And all the bristle-headed cried , “ Ja wohl ! ”</l>
       <l n="36">And so next day your battle rolled across the Menin Plain ,</l>
       <l n="37">Where Capper 's men stood lonely to your wrath .</l>
       <l n="38">You broke him , and you broke him , but you broke him all in vain ,</l>
       <l n="39">For he and his contemptibles kept closing up again ,</l>
       <l n="40">And the khaki bar was still across your path .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="41">And on the day when Gheluvelt lay smoking in the sun ,</l>
       <l n="42">When Von Deimling stormed so hotly in the van ,</l>
       <l n="43">You smiled as Haig reeled backwards and you thought him on the run ,</l>
       <l n="44">But , alas for dreams that vanish , for before the day was done</l>
       <l n="45">It was you , my Lord of Wuertemberg , that ran .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="46">A dreary day was that — but another came , more dreary ,</l>
       <l n="47">When the Guard from Arras led your fierce attacks ,</l>
       <l n="48">Spruce and splendid in the morning were the Potsdam Grenadiere ,</l>
       <l n="49">But not so spruce that evening when they staggered spent and weary ,</l>
       <l n="50">With those cursed British storming at their backs .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="51">You knew — your spies had told you — that the ranks were scant and thin ,</l>
       <l n="52">That the guns were short of shell and very few ,</l>
       <l n="53">By all Bernhardi 's maxims you were surely bound to win ,</l>
       <l n="54">There 's the open town before you . Haste , my Lord , and enter in ,</l>
       <l n="55">Or the War-Lord may have telegrams for you .</l>
       <l n="56">Then came the rainy winter , when the price was ever dearer ,</l>
       <l n="57">Every time you neared the prize of which you dreamed ,</l>
       <l n="58">Each day the Belfry faced you but you never brought it nearer ,</l>
       <l n="59">Each night you saw it clearly but you never saw it clearer .</l>
       <l n="60">Ah , what a weary time it must have seemed !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="61">At last there came the Easter when you loosed the coward gases ,</l>
       <l n="62">Surely you have got the rascals now !</l>
       <l n="63">You could see them spent and choking as you watched them thro ’ your</l>
       <l n="64">glasses ,</l>
       <l n="65">Yes , they choke , but never waver , and again the moment passes</l>
       <l n="66">Without one leaf of laurel for your brow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="67">Then at Hooge you had them helpless , for their guns were one to ten ,</l>
       <l n="68">And you blasted trench and traverse at your will ,</l>
       <l n="69">You had them dead and buried , but they still sprang up again .</l>
       <l n="70">“ Donnerwetter ! ” cried your Lordship , “ Donnerwetter ! ” cried your men ,</l>
       <l n="71">For their very ghosts were guarding Ypres still .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="72">Active , Guards , Reserve — men of every corps and name</l>
       <l n="73">That the bugles of the War-Lord muster in ,</l>
       <l n="74">Each in turn you tried them , but the story was the same ;</l>
       <l n="75">Play it how you would , my Lord , you never won the game ,</l>
       <l n="76">No , never in a twelvemonth did you win .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="77">A year , my Lord of Wuertemberg — a year , or nearly so ,</l>
       <l n="78">Since first you faced the British vis-a-vis !</l>
       <l n="79">Your learned Commandanten are the men who ought to know ,</l>
       <l n="80">But to ordinary mortals it would seem a trifle slow ,</l>
       <l n="81">If you really mean to travel to the sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="82">If you cannot straf the British , since they strafen you so well ,</l>
       <l n="83">You can safely smash the town that lies so near ,</l>
       <l n="84">So it 's down with arch and buttress , down with belfry and with bell ,</l>
       <l n="85">And it 's hoch the seven-seven that can drop the petrol shell</l>
       <l n="86">On the shrines that pious hands have loved to rear !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="87">Fair Ypres was a relic of the soul of other days ,</l>
       <l n="88">A poet 's dream , a wanderer 's delight ,</l>
       <l n="89">We will keep it as a symbol of your brute Teutonic ways</l>
       <l n="90">That millions yet unborn may come and curse you as they gaze</l>
       <l n="91">At this token of your impotence and spite .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="92">For shame , my Lord of Wuertemberg ! Across the Flemish Fen</l>
       <l n="93">See where the little army calls you .</l>
       <l n="94">It 's just the old familiar line of fifty thousand men ,</l>
       <l n="95">They 've beat you once or twice , my Lord , but venture it again ,</l>
       <l n="96">Come , try your luck , whatever fate befalls you .</l>
