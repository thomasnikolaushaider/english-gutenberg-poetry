    <p>To My Nephew ] [ Illustration : Careless Jane ] [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] “ Come Jane , ” said grandmamma one day , “ ‘ Tis time you learned to sew ; At your age I could make a frock , And you should also know . ” But Jane cared little for such things ; She liked to make a noise ; She used to run about all day , And shout , and play with boys . [ Illustration ] So now she only tossed her head And ran with eager feet , And soon was racing up and down , And playing in the street . Once Jane was to a party asked ; Her friends would all be there ; She wore her best sprigged muslin frock , And ribbons tied her hair . [ Illustration ] When she was shown upstairs to lay Her hat upon the bed , She saw a little basket there , With needles , wax and thread . “ I wonder , ” said untidy Jane , “ If Mattie likes to sew ; I 'm glad that I have never learned ; I should not care to know . ” [ Illustration ] With that she laughed and ran downstairs , But on the way — ah see ! She 's caught her skirt upon a nail And torn it terribly . If Jane had learned from grandmamma She might have mended it , But she had been a thoughtless child And could not sew a bit . [ Illustration ] So with her frock all torn , into The room she had to go , And all the children wondering stared To see her looking so ; Then when Jane played it caught her feet And almost made her fall ; That shamed her so she ran away And tried to hide from all . [ Illustration ] When nurse at last was sent for her , How glad was little Jane ; She almost thought she never wished To romp or play again . “ Oh ! grandmamma , dear grandmamma , Indeed , indeed , ” said she , “ If now you 'll teach me how to sew A thankful child I 'll be . ”</p>
