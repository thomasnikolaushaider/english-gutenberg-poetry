    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How long the echoes love to play</l>
     <l n="2">Around the shore of silence , as a wave</l>
     <l n="3">Retreating circles down the sand !</l>
     <l n="4">One after one , with sweet delay ,</l>
     <l n="5">The mellow sounds that cliff and island gave ,</l>
     <l n="6">Have lingered in the crescent bay ,</l>
     <l n="7">Until , by lightest breezes fanned ,</l>
     <l n="8">They float far off beyond the dying day</l>
     <l n="9">And leave it still as death .</l>
     <l n="10">But hark ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Another singing breath</l>
     <l n="12">Comes from the edge of dark ;</l>
     <l n="13">A note as clear and slow</l>
     <l n="14">As falls from some enchanted bell ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or spirit , passing from the world below ,</l>
     <l n="16">That whispers back , Farewell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">So in the heart ,</l>
     <l n="18">When , fading slowly down the past ,</l>
     <l n="19">Fond memories depart ,</l>
     <l n="20">And each that leaves it seems the last ;</l>
     <l n="21">Long after all the rest are flown ,</l>
     <l n="22">Returns a solitary tone ,—</l>
     <l n="23">The after-echo of departed years ,—</l>
     <l n="24">And touches all the soul to tears .</l>

    <p>DULCIORA</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">A tear that trembles for a little while</l>
     <l n="27">Upon the trembling eyelid , till the world</l>
     <l n="28">Wavers within its circle like a dream ,</l>
     <l n="29">Holds more of meaning in its narrow orb</l>
     <l n="30">Than all the distant landscape that it blurs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="31">A smile that hovers round a mouth beloved ,</l>
     <l n="32">Like the faint pulsing of the Northern Light ,</l>
     <l n="33">And grows in silence to an amber dawn</l>
     <l n="34">Born in the sweetest depths of trustful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="35">Is dearer to the soul than sun or star .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">A joy that falls into the hollow heart</l>
     <l n="37">From some far-lifted height of love unseen ,</l>
     <l n="38">Unknown , makes a more perfect melody</l>
     <l n="39">Than hidden brooks that murmur in the dusk ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or fall athwart the cliff with wavering gleam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="41">Ah , not for their own sake are earth and sky</l>
     <l n="42">And the fair ministries of Nature dear ,</l>
     <l n="43">But as they set themselves unto the tune</l>
     <l n="44">That fills our life ; as light mysterious</l>
     <l n="45">Flows from within and glorifies the world .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="46">For so a common wayside blossom , touched</l>
     <l n="47">With tender thought , assumes a grace more sweet</l>
     <l n="48">Than crowns the royal lily of the South ;</l>
     <l n="49">And so a well-remembered perfume seems</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At dawn in silence moves the mighty stream ,</l>
     <l n="2">The silver-crested waves no murmur make ;</l>
     <l n="3">But far away the avalanches wake</l>
     <l n="4">The rumbling echoes , dull as in a dream ;</l>
     <l n="5">Their momentary thunders , dying , seem</l>
     <l n="6">To fall into the stillness , flake by flake ,</l>
     <l n="7">And leave the hollow air with naught to break</l>
     <l n="8">The frozen spell of solitude supreme .</l>

     <l n="9">At noon unnumbered rills begin to spring</l>
     <l n="10">Beneath the burning sun , and all the walls</l>
     <l n="11">Of all the ocean-blue crevasses ring</l>
     <l n="12">With liquid lyrics of their waterfalls ;</l>
     <l n="13">As if a poet 's heart had felt the glow</l>
     <l n="14">Of sovereign love , and song began to flow .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">White Death had laid his pall upon the plain ,</l>
     <l n="2">And crowned the mountain-peaks like monarchs dead ;</l>
     <l n="3">The vault of heaven was glaring overhead</l>
     <l n="4">With pitiless light that filled my eyes with pain ;</l>
     <l n="5">And while I vainly longed , and looked in vain</l>
     <l n="6">For sign or trace of life , my spirit said ,</l>

     <l n="8">This royal lair of Death escape again ? ”</l>

     <l n="11">Some roving chamois , but an hour ago ,</l>
     <l n="12">Had passed this way along his journey fleet ,</l>

    <head>THE LILY OF YORROW</head>
    <head>Deep in the heart of the forest the lily of Yorrow is growing ; Blue is its cup as the sky , and with mystical odour o'erflowing ; Faintly it falls through the shadowy glades when the south wind is blowing .</head>
     <l n="1">Sweet are the primroses pale and the violets after a shower ;</l>

   <p>NARRATIVE POEMS</p>
   <p>THE TOILING OF FELIX</p>
   <p>A LEGEND ON A NEW SAYING OF JESUS</p>
   <p>In the rubbish heaps of the ancient city of Oxyrhynchus , near the River Nile , a party of English explorers , in the winter of 1897 , discovered a fragment of a papyrus book , written in the second or third century , and hitherto unknown . This single leaf contained parts of seven short sentences of Christ , each introduced by the words , “ Jesus says . ” It is to the fifth of these Sayings of Jesus that the following poem refers .</p>

      <l n="1">A silent world ,— yet full of vital joy</l>

      <l n="13">A silent world was Vera 's home .</l>
      <l n="14">For her</l>
      <l n="15">The inner doors of sound were closely sealed</l>
      <l n="16">The outer portals , delicate as shells</l>
      <l n="17">Suffused with faintest rose of far-off morn ,</l>
      <l n="18">Like underglow of daybreak in the sea ,—</l>
      <l n="19">The ear-gates of the garden of her soul ,</l>

      <l n="36">His coming : but no sea-toned voice of pines ,</l>
      <l n="37">No roaring of the oaks , no silvery song</l>
      <l n="38">Of poplars or of birches , followed him .</l>

      <l n="44">The lowland brooks coiled smoothly through the fields ,</l>
      <l n="45">And softly spread themselves in glistening lakes</l>
      <l n="46">Whose ripples merrily danced among the reeds .</l>
      <l n="47">The standing waves that ever keep their place</l>
      <l n="48">In the swift rapids , curled upon themselves ,</l>

      <l n="50">And all the wandering waves that fill the sea</l>
      <l n="51">Came buffeting in along the stony shore ,</l>

      <l n="55">And turmoil of the restless element</l>
      <l n="56">Came neither song of joy nor sob of grief ;</l>

      <l n="68">The birds , the most alive of living things ,</l>

      <l n="70">And swam the flood of air like tiny ships</l>
      <l n="71">Rising and falling over unseen waves ,</l>
      <l n="72">And , gathering in great navies , bore away</l>

      <l n="74">All these were Vera 's playmates ; and she loved</l>

      <l n="77">So swiftly , smoothly on from scene to scene</l>
      <l n="78">Without confusion . But she sometimes dreamed</l>
      <l n="79">There must be something hidden in the play</l>
      <l n="80">Unknown to her , an utterance of life</l>
      <l n="81">More clear than action and more deep than looks .</l>
      <l n="82">And this she felt most deeply when she watched</l>
      <l n="83">Her human comrades and the throngs of men ,</l>
      <l n="84">Who met and parted oft with moving lips</l>
      <l n="85">That had a meaning more than she could see .</l>
      <l n="86">She saw a lover bend above a maid ,</l>
      <l n="87">With moving lips ; and though he touched her not</l>
      <l n="88">A sudden rose of joy bloomed in her face .</l>
      <l n="89">She saw a hater stand before his foe</l>
      <l n="90">And move his lips ; whereat the other shrank</l>
      <l n="91">As if he had been smitten on the mouth .</l>
      <l n="92">She saw the regiments of toiling men</l>
      <l n="93">Marshalled in ranks and led by moving lips .</l>
      <l n="94">And once she saw a sight more strange than all :</l>
      <l n="95">A crowd of people sitting charmed and still</l>
      <l n="96">Around a little company of men</l>
      <l n="97">Who touched their hands in measured , rhythmic time</l>
      <l n="98">To curious instruments ; a woman stood</l>
      <l n="99">Among them , with bright eyes and heaving breast ,</l>
      <l n="100">And lifted up her face and moved her lips .</l>
      <l n="101">Then Vera wondered at the idle play ,</l>
      <l n="102">But when she looked around , she saw the glow</l>
      <l n="103">Of deep delight on every face , as if</l>
      <l n="104">Some visitor from a celestial world</l>
      <l n="105">Had brought glad tidings . But to her alone</l>
      <l n="106">No angel entered , for the choir of sound</l>
      <l n="107">Was vacant in the temple of her soul ,</l>
      <l n="108">And worship lacked her golden crown of song .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="109">So when by vision baffled and perplexed</l>
      <l n="110">She saw that all the world could not be seen ,</l>
      <l n="111">And knew she could not know the whole of life</l>
      <l n="112">Unless a hidden gate should be unsealed ,</l>
      <l n="113">She felt imprisoned . In her heart there grew</l>
      <l n="114">The bitter creeping plant of discontent ,</l>
      <l n="115">The plant that only grows in prison soil ,</l>
      <l n="116">Whose root is hunger and whose fruit is pain .</l>
      <l n="117">The springs of still delight and tranquil joy</l>
      <l n="118">Were drained as dry as desert dust to feed</l>
      <l n="119">That never-flowering vine , whose tendrils clung</l>
      <l n="120">With strangling touch around the bloom of life</l>
      <l n="121">And made it wither . Vera could not rest</l>
      <l n="122">Within the limits of her silent world ;</l>
      <l n="123">Along its dumb and desolate paths she roamed</l>
      <l n="124">A captive , looking sadly for escape .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="125">Now in those distant days , and in that land</l>
      <l n="126">Remote , there lived a Master wonderful ,</l>
      <l n="127">Who knew the secret of all life , and could ,</l>
      <l n="128">With gentle touches and with potent words ,</l>
      <l n="129">Open all gates that ever had been sealed ,</l>
      <l n="130">And loose all prisoners whom Fate had bound .</l>
      <l n="131">Obscure he dwelt , not in the wilderness ,</l>
      <l n="132">But in a hut among the throngs of men ,</l>
      <l n="133">Concealed by meekness and simplicity .</l>
      <l n="134">And ever as he walked the city streets ,</l>
      <l n="135">Or sat in quietude beside the sea ,</l>
      <l n="136">Or trod the hillsides and the harvest fields ,</l>
      <l n="137">The multitude passed by and knew him not .</l>
      <l n="138">But there were some who knew , and turned to him</l>
      <l n="139">For help ; and unto all who asked , he gave .</l>
      <l n="140">Thus Vera came , and found him in the field ,</l>
      <l n="141">And knew him by the pity in his face .</l>
      <l n="142">She knelt to him and held him by one hand ,</l>
      <l n="143">And laid the other hand upon her lips</l>
      <l n="144">In mute entreaty . Then she lifted up</l>
      <l n="145">The coils of hair that hung about her neck ,</l>
      <l n="146">And bared the beauty of the gates of sound ,—</l>
      <l n="147">Those virgin gates through which no voice had passed ,—</l>
      <l n="148">She made them bare before the Master 's sight ,</l>
      <l n="149">And looked into the kindness of his face</l>
      <l n="150">With eyes that spoke of all her prisoned pain ,</l>
      <l n="151">And told her great desire without a word .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="152">The Master waited long in silent thought ,</l>
      <l n="153">As one reluctant to bestow a gift ,</l>
      <l n="154">Not for the sake of holding back the thing</l>
      <l n="155">Entreated , but because he surely knew</l>
      <l n="156">Of something better that he fain would give</l>
      <l n="157">If only she would ask it . Then he stooped</l>
      <l n="158">To Vera , smiling , touched her ears and spoke :</l>

      <l n="160">Within the ivory labyrinth of the ear ,</l>
      <l n="161">Let fall the bar of silence and unfold !</l>
      <l n="162">Enter , you voices of all living things ,</l>
      <l n="163">Enter the garden sealed ,— but softly , slowly ,</l>
      <l n="164">Not with a noise confused and broken tumult ,—</l>
      <l n="165">Come in an order sweet as I command you ,</l>

      <l n="167">Vera began to hear . At first the wind</l>

      <l n="170">By unseen fingers ; then the little stream</l>
      <l n="171">That hurried down the hillside , swept the harp</l>
      <l n="172">Of music into merry , tinkling notes ;</l>
      <l n="173">And then the lark that poised above her head</l>
      <l n="174">On wings a-quiver , overflowed the air</l>
      <l n="175">With showers of song ; and one by one the tones</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="200">To every living thing a voice was given</l>

      <l n="204">That nested in their branches had a song</l>
      <l n="205">Unknown to other birds and all his own .</l>
      <l n="206">The waters spoke a hundred dialects</l>
      <l n="207">Of one great language ; now with pattering fall</l>
      <l n="208">Of raindrops on the glistening leaves , and now</l>
      <l n="209">With steady roar of rivers rushing down</l>
      <l n="210">To meet the sea , and now with rhythmic throb</l>
      <l n="211">And measured tumult of tempestuous waves ,</l>
      <l n="212">And now with lingering lisp of creeping tides ,—</l>
      <l n="213">The manifold discourse of many waters .</l>
      <l n="214">But most of all the human voice was full</l>
      <l n="215">Of infinite variety , and ranged</l>

      <l n="254">One voice alone of all that sound on earth ,</l>

      <l n="344">The murmur of a myriad-throated mob ;</l>

      <l n="382">And tracing every feeling like a thread</l>
      <l n="383">Within the mystic web the passions weave</l>

      <l n="388">A sadness fell upon her , and the load</l>

      <l n="400">Beneath the rocks and filled a mossy cup</l>
      <l n="401">With never-failing water . There he sat ,</l>

      <l n="412">The voice of perfect peace ; but what I hear</l>
      <l n="413">Brings me disquiet and a troubled mind .</l>
      <l n="414">The evil voices in the souls of men ,</l>
      <l n="415">Voices of rage and cruelty and fear</l>

      <l n="421">But while I listen to the troubled sound ,</l>
      <l n="422">One thing torments me , and destroys my rest</l>
      <l n="423">And presses me with dull , unceasing pain .</l>
      <l n="424">For out of all the minds of all mankind ,</l>
      <l n="425">There rises evermore a questioning voice</l>
      <l n="426">That asks the meaning of this mighty world</l>
      <l n="427">And finds no answer ,— asks , and asks again ,</l>
      <l n="428">With patient pleading or with wild complaint ,</l>

      <l n="430">Of other questions , wandering to and fro ,</l>
      <l n="431">From other souls in doubt . And so this voice</l>
      <l n="432">Persists above all others that I hear ,</l>
      <l n="433">And binds them up together into one ,</l>
      <l n="434">Until the mingled murmur of the world</l>
      <l n="435">Sounds through the inner temple of my heart</l>
      <l n="436">Like an eternal question , vainly asked</l>
      <l n="437">By every human soul that thinks and feels .</l>
      <l n="438">This is the heaviness that weighs me down ,</l>
      <l n="439">And this the pain that will not let me rest .</l>
      <l n="440">Therefore , dear Master , shut the gates again ,</l>
      <l n="441">And let me live in silence as before !</l>
      <l n="442">Or else ,— and if there is indeed a gate</l>

      <l n="450">Only the outer voice of things may pass ;</l>
      <l n="451">And through the middle doorway of the mind</l>
      <l n="452">Only the half-formed voice of human thoughts ,</l>
      <l n="453">Uncertain and perplexed with endless doubt ;</l>
      <l n="454">But through the inmost gate the spirit hears</l>
      <l n="455">The voice of that great Spirit who is Life .</l>
      <l n="456">Beneath the tones of living things He breathes</l>
      <l n="457">A deeper tone than ever ear hath heard ;</l>
      <l n="458">And underneath the troubled thoughts of men</l>
      <l n="459">He thinks forever , and His thought is peace .</l>
      <l n="460">Behold , I touch thee once again , my child :</l>
      <l n="461">The third and last of those three hidden gates</l>
      <l n="462">That closed around thy soul and shut thee in ,</l>

    <head>A LEGEND OF SERVICE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It pleased the Lord of Angels ( praise His name ! )</l>
     <l n="2">To hear , one day , report from those who came</l>
     <l n="3">With pitying sorrow , or exultant joy ,</l>
     <l n="4">To tell of earthly tasks in His employ .</l>
     <l n="5">For some were grieved because they saw how slow</l>
     <l n="6">The stream of heavenly love on earth must flow ;</l>
     <l n="7">And some were glad because their eyes had seen ,</l>
     <l n="8">Along its banks , fresh flowers and living green .</l>
     <l n="9">At last , before the whiteness of the throne</l>
     <l n="10">The youngest angel , Asmiel , stood alone ;</l>
     <l n="11">Nor glad , nor sad , but full of earnest thought ,</l>
     <l n="12">And thus his tidings to the Master brought</l>
     <l n="13">“ Lord , in the city Lupon I have found</l>
     <l n="14">Three servants of thy holy name , renowned</l>
     <l n="15">Above their fellows . One is very wise ,</l>
     <l n="16">With thoughts that ever range beyond the skies ;</l>
     <l n="17">And one is gifted with the golden speech</l>
     <l n="18">That makes men gladly hear when he will teach ;</l>
     <l n="19">And one , with no rare gift or grace endued ,</l>
     <l n="20">Has won the people 's love by doing good .</l>
     <l n="21">With three such saints Lupon is trebly blest ;</l>
     <l n="22">But , Lord , I fain would know , which loves Thee best ? ”</l>
     <l n="23">Then spake the Lord of Angels , to whose look</l>
     <l n="24">The hearts of all are like an open book :</l>
     <l n="25">“ In every soul the secret thought I read ,</l>
     <l n="26">And well I know who loves me best indeed .</l>
     <l n="27">But every life has pages vacant still ,</l>
     <l n="28">Whereon a man may write the thing he will ;</l>
     <l n="29">Therefore I read the record , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="30">And wait for hearts untaught to learn my way .</l>
     <l n="31">But thou shalt go to Lupon , to the three</l>
     <l n="32">Who serve me there , and take this word from me :</l>
     <l n="33">Tell each of them his Master bids him go</l>
     <l n="34">Alone to Spiran 's huts , across the snow ;</l>
     <l n="35">There he shall find a certain task for me :</l>
     <l n="36">But what , I do not tell to them nor thee .</l>
     <l n="37">Give thou the message , make my word the test ,</l>
     <l n="38">And crown for me the one who loves me best . ”</l>
     <l n="39">Silent the angel stood , with folded hands ,</l>
     <l n="40">To take the imprint of his Lord 's commands ;</l>
     <l n="41">Then drew one breath , obedient and elate ,</l>
     <l n="42">And passed the self-same hour , through Lupon 's gate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="43">First to the Temple door he made his way ;</l>
     <l n="44">And there , because it was a holy-day ,</l>
     <l n="45">He saw the folk in thousands thronging , stirred</l>
     <l n="46">By ardent thirst to hear the preacher 's word .</l>
     <l n="47">Then , while the people whispered Bernol 's name ,</l>
     <l n="48">Through aisles that hushed behind him Bernol came ;</l>
     <l n="49">Strung to the keenest pitch of conscious might ,</l>
     <l n="50">With lips prepared and firm , and eyes alight .</l>
     <l n="51">One moment at the pulpit step he knelt</l>
     <l n="52">In silent prayer , and on his shoulder felt</l>

     <l n="54">Alone to Spiran 's huts , across the snow ,</l>
     <l n="55">To serve Him there . ” Then Bernol 's hidden face</l>

     <l n="57">Of ten slow heart-beats there was no reply ;</l>
     <l n="58">Till Bernol looked around and whispered , “ Why ? ”</l>
     <l n="59">But answer to his question came there none ;</l>
     <l n="60">The angel sighed , and with a sigh was gone .</l>

     <l n="62">His studious years , on holy things intent ,</l>
     <l n="63">Sweet stillness reigned ; and there the angel found</l>
     <l n="64">The saintly sage immersed in thought profound ,</l>

     <l n="66">A web of wisdom , wonderful and fair :</l>
     <l n="67">A seamless robe for Truth 's great bridal meet ,</l>

     <l n="74">Malvin looked up , reluctance in his eyes .</l>
     <l n="75">The broken thought , the strangeness of the call ,</l>
     <l n="76">The perilous passage of the mountain-wall ,</l>
     <l n="77">The solitary journey , and the length</l>
     <l n="78">Of ways unknown , too great for his frail strength ,</l>
     <l n="79">Appalled him . With a doubtful brow</l>
     <l n="80">He scanned the doubtful task , and muttered “ How ? ”</l>
     <l n="81">But Asmiel answered , as he turned to go ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="83">Now as he went , with fading hope , to seek</l>

     <l n="86">But Fermor , hurrying cheerful down the street ,</l>
     <l n="87">With ready heart that faced his work like play ,</l>
     <l n="88">And joyed to find it greater every day !</l>
     <l n="89">The angel stopped him with uplifted hand ,</l>
     <l n="90">And gave without delay his Lord 's command :</l>

     <l n="92">Alone to Spiran 's huts , across the snow ,</l>
     <l n="93">To serve Him there . ” Ere Asmiel breathed again</l>
     <l n="94">The eager answer leaped to meet him , “ When ? ”</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="1">Long ago Apollo called to Aristæus , youngest of the shepherds ,</l>
     <l n="2">Saying , “ I will make you keeper of my bees . ”</l>
     <l n="3">Golden were the hives and golden was the honey ; golden , too , the music</l>
     <l n="4">Where the honey-makers hummed among the trees .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Happy Aristæus loitered in the garden , wandered in the orchard ,</l>
     <l n="6">Careless and contented , indolent and free ;</l>
     <l n="7">Lightly took his labour , lightly took his pleasure , till the fated moment</l>
     <l n="8">When across his pathway came Eurydice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Then her eyes enkindled burning love within him ; drove him wild with</l>
     <l n="10">longing</l>
     <l n="11">For the perfect sweetness of her flower-like face ;</l>
     <l n="12">Eagerly he followed , while she fled before him , over mead and mountain ,</l>
     <l n="13">On through field and forest , in a breathless race .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">But the nymph , in flying , trod upon a serpent ; like a dream she vanished ;</l>
     <l n="15">Pluto 's chariot bore her down among the dead !</l>
     <l n="16">Lonely Aristæus , sadly home returning , found his garden empty ,</l>
     <l n="17">All the hives deserted , all the music fled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">Mournfully bewailing ,— “ Ah , my honey-makers , where have you departed ? ”</l>
     <l n="19">Far and wide he sought them over sea and shore ;</l>
     <l n="20">Foolish is the tale that says he ever found them , brought them home in</l>
     <l n="21">triumph ,—</l>
     <l n="22">Joys that once escape us fly for evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="23">Yet I dream that somewhere , clad in downy whiteness , dwell the</l>
     <l n="24">honey-makers ,</l>
     <l n="25">In aërial gardens that no mortal sees :</l>
     <l n="26">And at times returning , lo , they flutter round us , gathering mystic</l>
     <l n="27">harvest ,—</l>
     <l n="28">So I weave the legend of the long-lost bees .</l>

     <l n="1">Who can tell the hiding of the white bees ’ nest ?</l>
     <l n="2">Who can trace the guiding of their swift home flight ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Wait till winter hardens in the cold gray sky ,</l>

     <l n="13">Out of the high-built airy hive ,</l>
     <l n="14">Deep in the clouds that veil the sun ,</l>
     <l n="15">Look how the first of the swarm arrive ;</l>
     <l n="16">Timidly venturing , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="17">Down through the tranquil air ,</l>
     <l n="18">Wavering here and there ,</l>
     <l n="19">Large , and lazy in flight ,—</l>
     <l n="20">Caught by a lift of the breeze ,</l>
     <l n="21">Tangled among the naked trees ,—</l>
     <l n="22">Dropping then , without a sound ,</l>
     <l n="23">Feather-white , feather-light ,</l>
     <l n="24">To their rest on the ground .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="25">Thus the swarming is begun .</l>

     <l n="28">Till the slow descent is done .</l>
     <l n="29">Look beyond them , see how far</l>
     <l n="30">Down the vistas dim and gray ,</l>
     <l n="31">Multitudes are on the way .</l>
     <l n="32">Now a sudden brightness</l>
     <l n="33">Dawns within the sombre day ,</l>
     <l n="34">Over fields of whiteness ;</l>
     <l n="35">And the sky is swiftly alive</l>
     <l n="36">With the flutter and the flight</l>
     <l n="37">Of the shimmering bees , that pour</l>
     <l n="38">From the hidden door of the hive</l>
     <l n="39">Till you can count no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="40">Now on the branches of hemlock and pine</l>
     <l n="41">Thickly they settle and cluster and swing ,</l>
     <l n="42">Bending them low ; and the trellised vine</l>
     <l n="43">And the dark elm-boughs are traced with a line</l>
     <l n="44">Of beauty wherever the white bees cling .</l>
     <l n="45">Now they are hiding the wrecks of the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="46">Softly , softly , covering all ,</l>
     <l n="47">Over the grave of the summer hours</l>
     <l n="48">Spreading a silver pall .</l>
     <l n="49">Now they are building the broad roof ledge ,</l>
     <l n="50">Into a cornice smooth and fair ,</l>
     <l n="51">Moulding the terrace , from edge to edge ,</l>
     <l n="52">Into the sweep of a marble stair .</l>
     <l n="53">Wonderful workers , swift and dumb ,</l>
     <l n="54">Numberless myriads , still they come ,</l>

     <l n="56">Where is their queen ? Who is their master ?</l>
     <l n="57">The gardens are faded , the fields are frore ,—</l>
     <l n="58">What is the honey they toil to store</l>
     <l n="59">In the desolate day , where no blossoms gleam ?</l>

     <l n="61">But now the fretful wind awakes ;</l>

     <l n="65">To powdery drift ;</l>
     <l n="66">He tosses them away ,</l>
     <l n="67">He drives them like spray ;</l>
     <l n="68">He makes them veer and shift</l>

     <l n="70">In clouds blindly whirling ,</l>
     <l n="71">In rings madly swirling ,</l>
     <l n="72">Full of crazy wrath ,</l>
     <l n="73">So furious and fast they fly</l>
     <l n="74">They blur the earth and blot the sky</l>
     <l n="75">In wild , white mirk .</l>
     <l n="76">They fill the air with frozen wings</l>
     <l n="77">And tiny , angry , icy stings ;</l>
     <l n="78">They blind the eyes , and choke the breath ,</l>
     <l n="79">They dance a maddening dance of death</l>

     <l n="81">Sweeping the cover from the hill ,</l>
     <l n="82">Heaping the hollows deeper still ,</l>
     <l n="83">Effacing every line and mark ,</l>
     <l n="84">And swarming , storming in the dark</l>
     <l n="85">Through the long night ;</l>
     <l n="86">Until , at dawn , the wind lies down</l>
     <l n="87">Weary of fight ;</l>
     <l n="88">The last torn cloud , with trailing gown ,</l>
     <l n="89">Passes the open gates of light ;</l>

     <l n="91">Look how the landscape glitters wide and still ,</l>

     <l n="94">Buried in white oblivion , lies</l>
     <l n="95">Beneath the snow-drifts under crystal skies .</l>
     <l n="96">New hope , new love , new life , new cheer ,</l>
     <l n="97">Flow in the sunrise beam ,—</l>

     <l n="99">Upon the bosom of the wintry year ,</l>
     <l n="100">The honey-harvest of his wild white bees ,</l>

     <l n="1">Listen , my beloved , while the silver morning , like a tranquil vision ,</l>

      <l n="12">I knew so well , long , long ago ;</l>
      <l n="13">And on the pillared porch where Marguerite</l>
      <l n="14">Had sat with me , the moonlight lay like snow .</l>
      <l n="15">But she , my comrade and my friend of youth ,</l>
      <l n="16">Most gaily wise ,</l>
      <l n="17">Most innocently loved ,—</l>

      <l n="20">From that familiar dwelling , where she moved</l>
      <l n="21">Like mirth incarnate in the years before ,</l>
      <l n="22">Had gone into the hidden house of Death .</l>
      <l n="23">I thought the garden wore</l>
      <l n="24">White mourning for her blessed innocence ,</l>
      <l n="25">And the syringa 's breath</l>
      <l n="26">Came from the corner by the fence</l>
      <l n="27">Where she had made her rustic seat ,</l>
      <l n="28">With fragrance passionate , intense ,</l>
      <l n="29">As if it breathed a sigh for Marguerite .</l>
      <l n="30">My heart was heavy with a sense</l>
      <l n="31">Of something good for ever gone . I sought</l>
      <l n="32">Vainly for some consoling thought ,</l>
      <l n="33">Some comfortable word that I could say</l>
      <l n="34">To her sad father , whom I visited again</l>
      <l n="35">For the first time since she had gone away .</l>
      <l n="36">The bell rang shrill and lonely ,— then</l>
      <l n="37">The door was opened , and I sent my name</l>
      <l n="38">To him ,— but ah ! ‘ twas Marguerite who came !</l>
      <l n="39">There in the dear old dusky room she stood</l>
      <l n="40">Beneath the lamp , just as she used to stand ,</l>
      <l n="41">In tender mocking mood .</l>
      <l n="42">“ You did not ask for me , ” she said ,</l>
      <l n="43">“ And so I will not let you take my hand ;</l>
      <l n="44">But I must hear what secret talk you planned</l>
      <l n="45">With father . Come , my friend , be good ,</l>
      <l n="46">And tell me your affairs of state :</l>
      <l n="47">Why you have stayed away and made me wait</l>
      <l n="48">So long . Sit down beside me here ,—</l>
      <l n="49">And , do you know , it seems a year</l>
      <l n="50">Since we have talked together ,— why so late ? ”</l>
      <l n="51">Amazed , incredulous , confused with joy</l>
      <l n="52">I hardly dared to show ,</l>
      <l n="53">And stammering like a boy ,</l>
      <l n="54">I took the place she showed me at her side ;</l>
      <l n="55">And then the talk flowed on with brimming tide</l>
      <l n="56">Through the still night ,</l>
      <l n="57">While she with influence light</l>
      <l n="58">Controlled it , as the moon the flood .</l>
      <l n="59">She knew where I had been , what I had done ,</l>
      <l n="60">What work was planned , and what begun ;</l>
      <l n="61">My troubles , failures , fears she understood ,</l>
      <l n="62">And touched them with a heart so kind ,</l>
      <l n="63">That every care was melted from my mind ,</l>
      <l n="64">And every hope grew bright ,</l>
      <l n="65">And life seemed moving on to happy ends .</l>
      <l n="66">( Ah , what self-beggared fool was he</l>
      <l n="67">That said a woman cannot be</l>
      <l n="68">The very best of friends ? )</l>
      <l n="69">Then there were memories of old times ,</l>
      <l n="70">Recalled with many a gentle jest ;</l>
      <l n="71">And at the last she brought the book of rhymes</l>
      <l n="72">We made together , trying to translate</l>
      <l n="73">The Songs of Heine ( hers were always best ) .</l>
      <l n="74">“ Now come , ” she said ,</l>
      <l n="75">“ To-night we will collaborate</l>
      <l n="76">Again ; I 'll put you to the test .</l>
      <l n="77">Here 's one I never found the way to do ,—</l>
      <l n="78">The simplest are the hardest ones , you know ,—</l>
      <l n="79">I give this song to you . ”</l>
      <l n="80">And then she read :</l>
      <l n="81">Mein Kind , wir waren Kinder ,</l>
      <l n="82">Zwei Kinder , jung und froh .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="83">But all the while , a silent question stirred</l>
      <l n="84">Within me , though I dared not speak the word :</l>
      <l n="85">“ Is it herself , and is she truly here ,</l>
      <l n="86">And was I dreaming when I heard</l>
      <l n="87">That she was dead last year ?</l>
      <l n="88">Or was it true , and is she but a shade</l>
      <l n="89">Who brings a fleeting joy to eye and ear ,</l>
      <l n="90">Cold though so kind , and will she gently fade</l>
      <l n="91">When her sweet ghostly part is played</l>
      <l n="92">And the light-curtain falls at dawn of day ? ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="93">But while my heart was troubled by this fear</l>
      <l n="94">So deeply that I could not speak it out ,</l>
      <l n="95">Lest all my happiness should disappear ,</l>
      <l n="96">I thought me of a cunning way</l>
      <l n="97">To hide the question and dissolve the doubt .</l>
      <l n="98">“ Will you not give me now your hand ,</l>
      <l n="99">Dear Marguerite , ” I asked , “ to touch and hold ,</l>
      <l n="100">That by this token I may understand</l>
      <l n="101">You are the same true friend you were of old ? ”</l>
      <l n="102">She answered with a smile so bright and calm</l>
      <l n="103">It seemed as if I saw the morn arise</l>
      <l n="104">In the deep heaven of her eyes ;</l>
      <l n="105">And smiling so , she laid her palm</l>
      <l n="106">In mine . Dear God , it was not cold</l>
      <l n="107">But warm with vital heat !</l>
      <l n="108">“ You live ! ” I cried , “ you live , dear Marguerite ! ”</l>
      <l n="109">When I awoke ; but strangely comforted ,</l>
      <l n="110">Although I knew again that she was dead .</l>

    <head>THE VAIN KING</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In robes of Tyrian blue the King was drest ,</l>
     <l n="2">A jewelled collar shone upon his breast ,</l>
     <l n="3">A giant ruby glittered in his crown :</l>
     <l n="4">Lord of rich lands and many a splendid town ,</l>
     <l n="5">In him the glories of an ancient line</l>
     <l n="6">Of sober kings , who ruled by right divine ,</l>
     <l n="7">Were centred ; and to him with loyal awe</l>
     <l n="8">The people looked for leadership and law .</l>
     <l n="9">Ten thousand knights , the safeguard of the land ,</l>
     <l n="10">Were like a single sword within his hand ;</l>
     <l n="11">A hundred courts , with power of life and death ,</l>
     <l n="12">Proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath ;</l>
     <l n="13">And all the sacred growths that men had known</l>
     <l n="14">Of order and of rule upheld his throne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Proud was the King : yet not with such a heart</l>
     <l n="16">As fits a man to play a royal part .</l>
     <l n="17">Not his the pride that honours as a trust</l>
     <l n="18">The right to rule , the duty to be just :</l>
     <l n="19">Not his the dignity that bends to bear</l>
     <l n="20">The monarch 's yoke , the master 's load of care ,</l>
     <l n="21">And labours like the peasant at his gate ,</l>
     <l n="22">To serve the people and protect the State .</l>
     <l n="23">Another pride was his , and other joys :</l>
     <l n="24">To him the crown and sceptre were but toys ,</l>
     <l n="25">With which he played at glory 's idle game ,</l>
     <l n="26">To please himself and win the wreaths of fame .</l>
     <l n="27">The throne his fathers held from age to age ,</l>
     <l n="28">To his ambition seemed a fitting stage</l>
     <l n="29">Built for King Martin to display at will ,</l>
     <l n="30">His mighty strength and universal skill .</l>
     <l n="31">No conscious child , that , spoiled with praising , tries</l>
     <l n="32">At every step to win admiring eyes ,</l>
     <l n="33">No favourite mountebank , whose acting draws</l>
     <l n="34">From gaping crowds the thunder of applause ,</l>
     <l n="35">Was vainer than the King : his only thirst</l>
     <l n="36">Was to be hailed , in every race , the first .</l>
     <l n="37">When tournament was held , in knightly guise</l>
     <l n="38">The King would ride the lists and win the prize ;</l>
     <l n="39">When music charmed the court , with golden lyre</l>
     <l n="40">The King would take the stage and lead the choir ;</l>
     <l n="41">In hunting , his the lance to slay the boar ;</l>
     <l n="42">In hawking , see his falcon highest soar ;</l>
     <l n="43">In painting , he would wield the master 's brush ;</l>
     <l n="44">In high debate ,— “ the King is speaking ! Hush ! ”</l>
     <l n="45">Thus , with a restless heart , in every field</l>
     <l n="46">He sought renown , and made his subjects yield .</l>
     <l n="47">But while he played the petty games of life</l>
     <l n="48">His kingdom fell a prey to inward strife ;</l>
     <l n="49">Corruption through the court unheeded crept ,</l>
     <l n="50">And on the seat of honour justice slept .</l>
     <l n="51">The strong trod down the weak ; the helpless poor</l>
     <l n="52">Groaned under burdens grievous to endure ;</l>
     <l n="53">The nation 's wealth was spent in vain display ,</l>
     <l n="54">And weakness wore the nation 's heart away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="55">Yet think not Earth is blind to human woes —</l>
     <l n="56">Man has more friends and helpers than he knows ;</l>
     <l n="57">And when a patient people are oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="58">The land that bore them feels it in her breast .</l>
     <l n="59">Spirits of field and flood , of heath and hill ,</l>
     <l n="60">Are grieved and angry at the spreading ill ;</l>
     <l n="61">The trees complain together in the night ,</l>
     <l n="62">Voices of wrath are heard along the height ,</l>
     <l n="63">And secret vows are sworn , by stream and strand ,</l>
     <l n="64">To bring the tyrant low and free the land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="65">But little recked the pampered King of these ;</l>
     <l n="66">He heard no voice but such as praise and please .</l>
     <l n="67">Flattered and fooled , victor in every sport ,</l>
     <l n="68">One day he wandered idly with his court</l>
     <l n="69">Beside the river , seeking to devise</l>
     <l n="70">New ways to show his skill to wondering eyes .</l>
     <l n="71">There in the stream a patient angler stood ,</l>
     <l n="72">And cast his line across the rippling flood .</l>
     <l n="73">His silver spoil lay near him on the green :</l>
     <l n="74">“ Such fish , ” the courtiers cried , “ were never seen !</l>
     <l n="75">Three salmon longer than a cloth-yard shaft —</l>
     <l n="76">This man must be the master of his craft ! ”</l>
     <l n="77">“ An easy art ! ” the jealous King replied :</l>
     <l n="78">“ Myself could learn it better , if I tried ,</l>
     <l n="79">And catch a hundred larger fish a week —</l>
     <l n="80">Wilt thou accept the challenge , fellow ? Speak ! ”</l>
     <l n="81">The angler turned , came near , and bent his knee :</l>
     <l n="82">“ ‘ Tis not for kings to strive with such as me ;</l>
     <l n="83">Yet if the King commands it , I obey .</l>
     <l n="84">But one condition of the strife I pray :</l>
     <l n="85">The fisherman who brings the least to land</l>
     <l n="86">Shall do whate'er the other may command . ”</l>
     <l n="87">Loud laughed the King : “ A foolish fisher thou !</l>
     <l n="88">For I shall win , and rule thee then as now . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="89">Then to Prince John , a sober soul , sedate</l>
     <l n="90">And slow , King Martin left the helm of State ,</l>
     <l n="91">While to the novel game with eager zest</l>
     <l n="92">He all his time and all his powers addressed .</l>
     <l n="93">Sure such a sight was never seen before !</l>
     <l n="94">In robe and crown the monarch trod the shore ;</l>
     <l n="95">His golden hooks were decked with feathers fine ,</l>
     <l n="96">His jewelled reel ran out a silken line .</l>
     <l n="97">With kingly strokes he flogged the crystal stream ;</l>
     <l n="98">Far-off the salmon saw his tackle gleam ;</l>
     <l n="99">Careless of kings , they eyed with calm disdain</l>
     <l n="100">The gaudy lure , and Martin fished in vain .</l>
     <l n="101">On Friday , when the week was almost spent ,</l>
     <l n="102">He scanned his empty creel with discontent ,</l>
     <l n="103">Called for a net , and cast it far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="104">And drew — a thousand minnows from the tide !</l>
     <l n="105">Then came the angler to conclude the match ,</l>
     <l n="106">And at the monarch 's feet spread out his catch —</l>
     <l n="107">A hundred salmon , greater than before .</l>
     <l n="108">“ I win ! ” he cried : “ the King must pay the score . ”</l>
     <l n="109">Then Martin , angry , threw his tackle down :</l>
     <l n="110">“ Rather than lose this game I 'd lose my crown ! ”</l>
     <l n="111">“ Nay , thou hast lost them both , ” the angler said ;</l>
     <l n="112">And as he spoke a wondrous light was shed</l>
     <l n="113">Around his form ; he dropped his garments mean ,</l>
     <l n="114">And in his place the River-god was seen .</l>
     <l n="115">“ Thy vanity has brought thee in my power ,</l>
     <l n="116">And thou must pay the forfeit at this hour :</l>
     <l n="117">For thou hast shown thyself a royal fool ,</l>
     <l n="118">Too proud to angle , and too vain to rule ,</l>
     <l n="119">Eager to win in every trivial strife ,—</l>
     <l n="120">Go ! Thou shalt fish for minnows all thy life ! ”</l>
     <l n="121">Wrathful , the King the magic sentence heard ;</l>
     <l n="122">He strove to answer , but he only chirr-r-ed :</l>
     <l n="123">His royal robe was changed to wings of blue ,</l>
     <l n="124">His crown a ruby crest ,— away he flew !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="125">So every summer day along the stream</l>
     <l n="126">The vain King-fisher darts , an azure gleam ,</l>
     <l n="127">And scolds the angler with a mocking scream .</l>

    <head>THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A tale that the poet Rückert told</l>
     <l n="2">To German children , in days of old ;</l>
     <l n="3">Disguised in a random , rollicking rhyme</l>
     <l n="4">Like a merry mummer of ancient time ,</l>
     <l n="5">And sent , in its English dress , to please</l>
     <l n="6">The little folk of the Christmas trees .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">A little fir grew in the midst of the wood</l>
     <l n="8">Contented and happy , as young trees should .</l>
     <l n="9">His body was straight and his boughs were clean ;</l>
     <l n="10">And summer and winter the bountiful sheen</l>
     <l n="11">Of his needles bedecked him , from top to root ,</l>
     <l n="12">In a beautiful , all-the-year , evergreen suit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">But a trouble came into his heart one day ,</l>
     <l n="14">When he saw that the other trees were gay</l>
     <l n="15">In the wonderful raiment that summer weaves</l>
     <l n="16">Of manifold shapes and kinds of leaves :</l>
     <l n="17">He looked at his needles so stiff and small ,</l>
     <l n="18">And thought that his dress was the poorest of all .</l>
     <l n="19">Then jealousy clouded the little tree 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="20">And he said to himself , “ It was not very kind</l>
     <l n="21">To give such an ugly old dress to a tree !</l>
     <l n="22">If the fays of the forest would only ask me ,</l>
     <l n="23">I 'd tell them how I should like to be dressed ,—</l>
     <l n="24">In a garment of gold , to bedazzle the rest ! ”</l>
     <l n="25">So he fell asleep , but his dreams were bad .</l>
     <l n="26">When he woke in the morning , his heart was glad ;</l>
     <l n="27">For every leaf that his boughs could hold</l>
     <l n="28">Was made of the brightest beaten gold .</l>
     <l n="29">I tell you , children , the tree was proud ;</l>
     <l n="30">He was something above the common crowd ;</l>
     <l n="31">And he tinkled his leaves , as if he would say</l>
     <l n="32">To a pedlar who happened to pass that way ,</l>
     <l n="33">“ Just look at me ! Do n't you think I am fine ?</l>
     <l n="34">And would n't you like such a dress as mine ? ”</l>
     <l n="35">“ Oh , yes ! ” said the man , “ and I really guess</l>
     <l n="36">I must fill my pack with your beautiful dress . ”</l>
     <l n="37">So he picked the golden leaves with care ,</l>
     <l n="38">And left the little tree shivering there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="39">“ Oh , why did I wish for golden leaves ? ”</l>
     <l n="40">The fir-tree said , “ I forgot that thieves</l>
     <l n="41">Would be sure to rob me in passing by .</l>
     <l n="42">If the fairies would give me another try ,</l>
     <l n="43">I 'd wish for something that cost much less ,</l>
     <l n="44">And be satisfied with glass for my dress ! ”</l>
     <l n="45">Then he fell asleep ; and , just as before ,</l>
     <l n="46">The fairies granted his wish once more .</l>
     <l n="47">When the night was gone , and the sun rose clear ,</l>
     <l n="48">The tree was a crystal chandelier ;</l>
     <l n="49">And it seemed , as he stood in the morning light ,</l>
     <l n="50">That his branches were covered with jewels bright .</l>
     <l n="51">“ Aha ! ” said the tree . “ This is something great ! ”</l>
     <l n="52">And he held himself up , very proud and straight ;</l>
     <l n="53">But a rude young wind through the forest dashed ,</l>
     <l n="54">In a reckless temper , and quickly smashed</l>
     <l n="55">The delicate leaves . With a clashing sound</l>
     <l n="56">They broke into pieces and fell on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="57">Like a silvery , shimmering shower of hail ,</l>
     <l n="58">And the tree stood naked and bare to the gale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="59">Then his heart was sad ; and he cried , “ Alas</l>
     <l n="60">For my beautiful leaves of shining glass !</l>
     <l n="61">Perhaps I have made another mistake</l>
     <l n="62">In choosing a dress so easy to break .</l>
     <l n="63">If the fairies only would hear me again</l>
     <l n="64">I 'd ask them for something both pretty and plain :</l>
     <l n="65">It would n't cost much to grant my request ,—</l>
     <l n="66">In leaves of green lettuce I 'd like to be dressed ! ”</l>
     <l n="67">By this time the fairies were laughing , I know ;</l>
     <l n="68">But they gave him his wish in a second ; and so</l>
     <l n="69">With leaves of green lettuce , all tender and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="70">The tree was arrayed , from his head to his feet .</l>
     <l n="71">“ I knew it ! ” he cried , “ I was sure I could find</l>
     <l n="72">The sort of a suit that would be to my mind .</l>
     <l n="73">There 's none of the trees has a prettier dress ,</l>
     <l n="74">And none as attractive as I am , I guess . ”</l>
     <l n="75">But a goat , who was taking an afternoon walk ,</l>
     <l n="76">By chance overheard the fir-tree 's talk .</l>
     <l n="77">So he came up close for a nearer view ;—</l>
     <l n="78">“ My salad ! ” he bleated , “ I think so too !</l>
     <l n="79">You 're the most attractive kind of a tree ,</l>
     <l n="80">And I want your leaves for my five-o'clock tea . ”</l>
     <l n="81">So he ate them all without saying grace ,</l>
     <l n="82">And walked away with a grin on his face ;</l>
     <l n="83">While the little tree stood in the twilight dim ,</l>
     <l n="84">With never a leaf on a single limb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="85">Then he sighed and groaned ; but his voice was weak —</l>
     <l n="86">He was so ashamed that he could not speak .</l>
     <l n="87">He knew at last he had been a fool ,</l>
     <l n="88">To think of breaking the forest rule ,</l>
     <l n="89">And choosing a dress himself to please ,</l>
     <l n="90">Because he envied the other trees .</l>
     <l n="91">But it could n't be helped , it was now too late ,</l>
     <l n="92">He must make up his mind to a leafless fate !</l>
     <l n="93">So he let himself sink in a slumber deep ,</l>
     <l n="94">But he moaned and he tossed in his troubled sleep ,</l>
     <l n="95">Till the morning touched him with joyful beam ,</l>
     <l n="96">And he woke to find it was all a dream .</l>
     <l n="97">For there in his evergreen dress he stood ,</l>
     <l n="98">A pointed fir in the midst of the wood !</l>
     <l n="99">His branches were sweet with the balsam smell ,</l>
     <l n="100">His needles were green when the white snow fell .</l>
     <l n="101">And always contented and happy was he ,—</l>
     <l n="102">The very best kind of a Christmas tree .</l>

     <l n="12">Of all-embracing knowledge . Here , instead ,</l>
     <l n="13">A little cottage , and a garden-nook ,</l>
     <l n="14">With outlooks brief and sweet</l>
     <l n="15">Across the meadows , and along the brook ,—</l>
     <l n="16">A little stream that nothing knows</l>
     <l n="17">Of the great sea to which it gladly flows ,—</l>
     <l n="18">A little field that bears a little wheat</l>
     <l n="19">To make a portion of earth 's daily bread .</l>
     <l n="20">The vast cloud-armies overhead</l>
     <l n="21">Are marshalled , and the wild wind blows</l>
     <l n="22">Its trumpet , but thou canst not tell</l>
     <l n="23">Whence comes the wind nor where it goes ;</l>
     <l n="24">Nor dost thou greatly care , since all is well .</l>
     <l n="25">Thy daily task is done ,</l>
     <l n="26">And now the wages of repose are won .</l>
     <l n="27">Here friendship lights the fire , and every heart ,</l>
     <l n="28">Sure of itself and sure of all the rest ,</l>
     <l n="29">Dares to be true , and gladly takes its part</l>
     <l n="30">In open converse , bringing forth its best :</l>
     <l n="31">And here is music , melting every chain</l>
     <l n="32">Of lassitude and pain :</l>
     <l n="33">And here , at last , is sleep with silent gifts ,—</l>
     <l n="34">Kind sleep , the tender nurse who lifts</l>
     <l n="35">The soul grown weary of the waking world ,</l>
     <l n="36">And lays it , with its thoughts all furled ,</l>
     <l n="37">Its fears forgotten , and its passions still ,</l>
     <l n="38">On the deep bosom of the Eternal Will .</l>

     <l n="7">Borders of box in the yard , and lilacs , and old-fashioned roses ,</l>
     <l n="8">A fan-light above the door , and little square panes in the windows ,</l>
     <l n="9">The wood-shed piled with maple and birch and hickory ready for winter ,</l>
     <l n="10">The gambrel-roof with its garret crowded with household relics ,—</l>

     <l n="26">Long since the riders have ridden away , yet the houses have not</l>
     <l n="27">forgotten ,</l>
     <l n="28">They are proud of their name and place , and their doors are always open ,</l>

     <l n="33">And the gabled houses of the Dutch , with their high stoops and iron</l>
     <l n="34">railings ,</l>
     <l n="35">( I can see their little brass knobs shining in the morning sunlight ) ;</l>
     <l n="36">And the solid self-contained houses of the descendants of the Puritans ,</l>
     <l n="37">Frowning on the street with their narrow doors and dormer-windows ;</l>
     <l n="38">And the triple-galleried , many-pillared mansions of Charleston ,</l>
     <l n="39">Standing open sideways in their gardens of roses and magnolias .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Yes , they are all dear to my heart , and in my eyes they are beautiful ; For under their roofs were nourished the thoughts that have made the nation ; The glory and strength of America come from her ancestral dwellings .</p>

     <l n="94">I have not found it yet ,— but I have found</l>
     <l n="95">Things worth the finding !</l>
     <l n="96">Son , have you forgot</l>
     <l n="97">Those mellow autumn days , two years ago ,</l>
     <l n="98">When first we sent our little ship Half-Moon ,—</l>
     <l n="99">The flag of Holland floating at her peak ,—</l>
     <l n="100">Across a sandy bar , and sounded in</l>
     <l n="101">Among the channels , to a goodly bay</l>
     <l n="102">Where all the navies of the world could ride ?</l>
     <l n="103">A fertile island that the redmen called</l>
     <l n="104">Manhattan , lay above the bay : the land</l>
     <l n="105">Around was bountiful and friendly fair .</l>
     <l n="106">But never land was fair enough to hold</l>
     <l n="107">The seaman from the calling of the sea .</l>
     <l n="108">And so we bore to westward of the isle ,</l>
     <l n="109">Along a mighty inlet , where the tide</l>
     <l n="110">Was troubled by a downward-flowing flood</l>
     <l n="111">That seemed to come from far away ,— perhaps</l>
     <l n="112">From some mysterious gulf of Tartary ?</l>
     <l n="113">Inland we held our course ; by palisades</l>
     <l n="114">Of naked rock ; by rolling hills adorned</l>
     <l n="115">With forests rich in timber for great ships ;</l>
     <l n="116">Through narrows where the mountains shut us in</l>
     <l n="117">With frowning cliffs that seemed to bar the stream ;</l>
     <l n="118">And then through open reaches where the banks</l>
     <l n="119">Sloped to the water gently , with their fields</l>
     <l n="120">Of corn and lentils smiling in the sun .</l>
     <l n="121">Ten days we voyaged through that placid land ,</l>
     <l n="122">Until we came to shoals , and sent a boat</l>
     <l n="123">Upstream to find ,— what I already knew ,—</l>
     <l n="124">We travelled on a river , not a strait .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="125">But what a river ! God has never poured</l>
     <l n="126">A stream more royal through a land more rich .</l>
     <l n="127">Even now I see it flowing in my dream ,</l>
     <l n="128">While coming ages people it with men</l>
     <l n="129">Of manhood equal to the river 's pride .</l>
     <l n="130">I see the wigwams of the redmen changed</l>
     <l n="131">To ample houses , and the tiny plots</l>
     <l n="132">Of maize and green tobacco broadened out</l>
     <l n="133">To prosperous farms , that spread o'er hill and dale</l>
     <l n="134">The many-coloured mantle of their crops .</l>
     <l n="135">I see the terraced vineyard on the slope</l>
     <l n="136">Where now the fox-grape loops its tangled vine ,</l>
     <l n="137">And cattle feeding where the red deer roam ,</l>
     <l n="138">And wild-bees gathered into busy hives</l>
     <l n="139">To store the silver comb with golden sweet ;</l>
     <l n="140">And all the promised land begins to flow</l>
     <l n="141">With milk and honey . Stately manors rise</l>
     <l n="142">Along the banks , and castles top the hills ,</l>
     <l n="143">And little villages grow populous with trade ,</l>
     <l n="144">Until the river runs as proudly as the Rhine ,—</l>
     <l n="145">The thread that links a hundred towns and towers !</l>
     <l n="146">Now looking deeper in my dream , I see</l>
     <l n="147">A mighty city covering the isle</l>
     <l n="148">They call Manhattan , equal in her state</l>
     <l n="149">To all the older capitals of earth ,—</l>
     <l n="150">The gateway city of a golden world ,—</l>
     <l n="151">A city girt with masts , and crowned with spires ,</l>
     <l n="152">And swarming with a million busy men ,</l>
     <l n="153">While to her open door across the bay</l>
     <l n="154">The ships of all the nations flock like doves .</l>
     <l n="155">My name will be remembered there , the world</l>
     <l n="156">Will say , “ This river and this isle were found</l>
     <l n="157">By Henry Hudson , on his way to seek</l>
     <l n="158">The Northwest Passage . ”</l>
     <l n="159">Yes , I seek it still ,—</l>
     <l n="160">My great adventure and my guiding star !</l>
     <l n="161">For look ye , friends , our voyage is not done ;</l>
     <l n="162">We hold by hope as long as life endures !</l>
     <l n="163">Somewhere among these floating fields of ice ,</l>
     <l n="164">Somewhere along this westward widening bay ,</l>
     <l n="165">Somewhere beneath this luminous northern night ,</l>
     <l n="166">The channel opens to the Farthest East ,—</l>
     <l n="167">I know it ,— and some day a little ship</l>
     <l n="168">Will push her bowsprit in , and battle through !</l>
     <l n="169">And why not ours ,— to-morrow ,— who can tell ?</l>
     <l n="170">The lucky chance awaits the fearless heart !</l>
     <l n="171">These are the longest days of all the year ;</l>
     <l n="172">The world is round and God is everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="173">And while our shallop floats we still can steer .</l>

     <l n="10">Far and wide across the meadows .</l>
     <l n="11">And the red-men in their tepees</l>
     <l n="12">Smoked their pipes of clay and listened .</l>
     <l n="13">“ What is this ? ” they asked in wonder ;</l>
     <l n="14">“ Who can give the sound a meaning ?</l>
     <l n="15">Who can understand the language</l>
     <l n="16">Of this going in the tree-tops ? ”</l>
     <l n="17">Then the wisest of the Tejas</l>
     <l n="18">Laid his pipe aside and answered :</l>
     <l n="19">“ O my brothers , these are people ,</l>
     <l n="20">Very little , winged people ,</l>
     <l n="21">Countless , busy , banded people ,</l>
     <l n="22">Coming humming through the timber .</l>
     <l n="23">These are tribes of bees , united</l>
     <l n="24">By a single aim and purpose ,</l>
     <l n="25">To possess the Tejas ’ country ,</l>
     <l n="26">Gather harvest from the prairies ,</l>
     <l n="27">Store their wealth among the timber .</l>
     <l n="28">These are hive and honey makers ,</l>
     <l n="29">Sent by Manito to warn us</l>
     <l n="30">That the white men now are coming ,</l>
     <l n="31">With their women and their children .</l>
     <l n="32">Not the fiery filibusters</l>
     <l n="33">Passing wildly in a moment ,</l>
     <l n="34">Like a flame across the prairies ,</l>
     <l n="35">Like a whirlwind through the forest ,</l>
     <l n="36">Leaving empty lands behind them !</l>
     <l n="37">Not the Mexicans and Spaniards ,</l>
     <l n="38">Indolent and proud hidalgos ,</l>
     <l n="39">Dwelling in their haciendas ,</l>
     <l n="40">Dreaming , talking of tomorrow ,</l>
     <l n="41">While their cattle graze around them ,</l>
     <l n="42">And their fickle revolutions</l>
     <l n="43">Change the rulers , not the people !</l>
     <l n="44">Other folk are these who follow</l>
     <l n="45">When the wild-bees come to warn us ;</l>
     <l n="46">These are hive and honey makers ,</l>
     <l n="47">These are busy , banded people ,</l>
     <l n="48">Roaming far to swarm and settle ,</l>
     <l n="49">Working every day for harvest ,</l>
     <l n="50">Fighting hard for peace and order ,</l>
     <l n="51">Worshipping as queens their women ,</l>
     <l n="52">Making homes and building cities</l>
     <l n="53">Full of riches and of trouble .</l>
     <l n="54">All our hunting-grounds must vanish ,</l>
     <l n="55">All our lodges fall before them ,</l>
     <l n="56">All our customs and traditions ,</l>
     <l n="57">All our happy life of freedom ,</l>
     <l n="58">Fade away like smoke before them .</l>
     <l n="59">Come , my brothers , strike your tepees ,</l>
     <l n="60">Call your women , load your ponies !</l>
     <l n="61">Let us take the trail to westward ,</l>
     <l n="62">Where the plains are wide and open ,</l>
     <l n="63">Where the bison-herds are gathered</l>
     <l n="64">Waiting for our feathered arrows .</l>
     <l n="65">We will live as lived our fathers ,</l>
     <l n="66">Gleaners of the gifts of nature ,</l>
     <l n="67">Hunters of the unkept cattle ,</l>
     <l n="68">Men whose women run to serve them .</l>
     <l n="69">If the toiling bees pursue us ,</l>
     <l n="70">If the white men seek to tame us ,</l>
     <l n="71">We will fight them off and flee them ,</l>
     <l n="72">Break their hives and take their honey ,</l>
     <l n="73">Moving westward , ever westward ,</l>
     <l n="74">There to live as lived our fathers . ”</l>
     <l n="75">So the red-men drove their ponies ,</l>
     <l n="76">With the tent-poles trailing after ,</l>
     <l n="77">Out along the path to sunset ,</l>
     <l n="78">While along the river valleys</l>
     <l n="79">Swarmed the wild-bees , the forerunners ;</l>
     <l n="80">And the white men , close behind them ,</l>
     <l n="81">Men of mark from old Missouri ,</l>
     <l n="82">Men of daring from Kentucky ,</l>
     <l n="83">Tennessee , Louisiana ,</l>
     <l n="84">Men of many States and races ,</l>
     <l n="85">Bringing wives and children with them ,</l>
     <l n="86">Followed up the wooded valleys ,</l>
     <l n="87">Spread across the rolling prairies ,</l>
     <l n="88">Raising homes and reaping harvests .</l>
     <l n="89">Rude the toil that tried their patience ,</l>
     <l n="90">Fierce the fights that proved their courage ,</l>
     <l n="91">Rough the stone and tough the timber</l>
     <l n="92">Out of which they built their order !</l>
     <l n="93">Yet they never failed nor faltered ,</l>
     <l n="94">And the instinct of their swarming</l>
     <l n="95">Made them one and kept them working ,</l>
     <l n="96">Till their toil was crowned with triumph ,</l>
     <l n="97">And the country of the Tejas</l>
     <l n="98">Was the fertile land of Texas .</l>

    <head>THE RED FLOWER AND GOLDEN STARS</head>
    <head>These verses were written during the terrible world-war , and immediately after . The earlier ones had to be unsigned because America was still “ neutral ” and I held a diplomatic post . The rest of them were printed after I had resigned , and was free to speak out , and to take active service in the Navy , when America entered the great conflict for liberty and peace on earth .</head>

     <l n="8">But all day long on the eastern bank</l>

     <l n="11">Was hardly seen though near ,</l>
     <l n="12">The endless trains of German troops</l>

     <l n="23">When the trains had rattled by ;</l>

     <l n="26">Then came I into a certain field</l>
     <l n="27">Where the devil 's paint-brush spread</l>
     <l n="28">‘ Mid the gray and green of the rolling hills</l>
     <l n="29">A flaring splotch of red ,—</l>
     <l n="30">An evil omen , a bloody sign ,</l>

     <l n="32">I saw in a vision the field-gray horde</l>

     <l n="34">And trample the earth into crimson mud</l>
     <l n="35">In the rage of the Will to Power ,—</l>

   <p>THE GLORY OF SHIPS</p>
   <p>The glory of ships is an old , old song , since the days when the sea-rovers ran , In their open boats through the roaring surf , and the spread of the world began ; The glory of ships is a light on the sea , and a star in the story of man .</p>
   <p>When Homer sang of the galleys of Greece that conquered the Trojan shore , And Solomon lauded the barks of Tyre that brought great wealth to his door , ‘ Twas little they knew , those ancient men , what would come of the sail and the oar .</p>
   <p>The Greek ships rescued the West from the East , when they harried the Persians home ; And the Roman ships were the wings of strength that bore up the empire , Rome ; And the ships of Spain found a wide new world , far over the fields of foam .</p>
   <p>Then the tribes of courage at last saw clear that the ocean was not a bound , But a broad highway , and a challenge to seek for treasure as yet unfound ; So the fearless ships fared forth to the search , in joy that the globe was round .</p>
   <p>Their hulls were heightened , their sails spread out , they grew with the growth of their quest ; They opened the secret doors of the East , and the golden gates of the West ; And many a city of high renown was proud of a ship on its crest .</p>
   <p>The fleets of England and Holland and France were at strife with each other and Spain ; And battle and storm sent a myriad ships to sleep in the depths of the main ; But the seafaring spirit could never be drowned , and it filled up the fleets again .</p>
   <p>They greatened and grew , with the aid of steam , to a wonderful , vast array , That carries the thoughts and the traffic of men into every harbor and bay ; And now in the world-wide work of the ships ‘ tis England that leads the way .</p>
   <p>O well for the leading that follows the law of a common right on the sea ! But ill for the leader who tries to hold what belongs to mankind in fee ! The way of the ships is an open way , and the ocean must ever be free !</p>
   <p>Remember , O first of the maritime folk , how the rise of your greatness began . It will live if you safeguard the round-the-world road from the shame of a selfish ban ; For the glory of ships is a light on the sea , and a star in the story of man !</p>

   <p>LONGFELLOW</p>
   <p>In a great land , a new land , a land full of labour and riches and confusion , Where there were many running to and fro , and shouting , and striving together , In the midst of the hurry and the troubled noise , I heard the voice of one singing .</p>
   <p>“ What are you doing there , O man , singing quietly amid all this tumult ? This is the time for new inventions , mighty shoutings , and blowings of the trumpet . ” But he answered , “ I am only shepherding my sheep with music . ”</p>
   <p>So he went along his chosen way , keeping his little flock around him ; And he paused to listen , now and then , beside the antique fountains , Where the faces of forgotten gods were refreshed with musically falling waters ;</p>
   <p>Or he sat for a while at the blacksmith 's door , and heard the cling-clang of the anvils ; Or he rested beneath old steeples full of bells , that showered their chimes upon him ; Or he walked along the border of the sea , drinking in the long roar of the billows ;</p>
   <p>Or he sunned himself in the pine-scented shipyard , amid the tattoo of the mallets ; Or he leaned on the rail of the bridge , letting his thoughts flow with the whispering river ; He hearkened also to ancient tales , and made them young again with his singing .</p>
   <p>Then a flaming arrow of death fell on his flock , and pierced the heart of his dearest ! Silent the music now , as the shepherd entered the mystical temple of sorrow : Long he tarried in darkness there : but when he came out he was singing .</p>
   <p>And I saw the faces of men and women and children silently turning toward him ; The youth setting out on the journey of life , and the old man waiting beside the last mile-stone ; The toiler sweating beneath his load ; and the happy mother rocking her cradle ;</p>
   <p>The lonely sailor on far-off seas ; and the gray-minded scholar in his book-room ; The mill-hand bound to a clacking machine ; and the hunter in the forest ; And the solitary soul hiding friendless in the wilderness of the city ;</p>
   <p>Many human faces , full of care and longing , were drawn irresistibly toward him , By the charm of something known to every heart , yet very strange and lovely , And at the sound of his singing wonderfully all their faces were lightened .</p>
   <p>“ Why do you listen , O you people , to this old and world-worn music ? This is not for you , in the splendour of a new age , in the democratic triumph ! Listen to the clashing cymbals , the big drums , the brazen trumpets of your poets . ”</p>
   <p>But the people made no answer , following in their hearts the simpler music : For it seemed to them , noise-weary , nothing could be better worth the hearing Than the melodies which brought sweet order into life 's confusion .</p>
   <p>So the shepherd sang his way along , until he came unto a mountain : And I know not surely whether the mountain was called Parnassus , But he climbed it out of sight , and still I heard the voice of one singing .</p>

     <l n="20">And wings to joy to reach a heavenly height ;</l>
     <l n="21">And every dumb desire that storms within the breast</l>
     <l n="22">Thou leadest forth to sob or sing itself to rest .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">All these are thine , and therefore love is thine .</l>

     <l n="26">And fear , and hope , and longing unexpressed ,</l>
     <l n="27">In pain most human , and in rapture brief</l>
     <l n="28">Almost divine .</l>
     <l n="29">Love would possess , yet deepens when denied ;</l>

     <l n="35">Yet when the siege is set , and he must speak ,</l>
     <l n="36">Calling the fortress to resign</l>
     <l n="37">Its treasure , valiant love grows weak ,</l>
     <l n="38">And hardly dares his purpose to unfold .</l>
     <l n="39">Less with his faltering lips than with his eyes</l>
     <l n="40">He claims the longed-for prize :</l>
     <l n="41">Love fain would tell it all , yet leaves the best untold .</l>
     <l n="42">But thou shalt speak for love . Yea , thou shalt teach</l>
     <l n="43">The mystery of measured tone ,</l>
     <l n="44">The Pentecostal speech</l>
     <l n="45">That every listener heareth as his own .</l>
     <l n="46">For on thy head the cloven tongues of fire ,—</l>
     <l n="47">Diminished chords that quiver with desire ,</l>
     <l n="48">And major chords that glow with perfect peace ,—</l>
     <l n="49">Have fallen from above ;</l>
     <l n="50">And thou canst give release</l>

     <l n="55">And sob , and sigh ,</l>
     <l n="56">With muted string ;</l>
     <l n="57">Then let the oboe half-reluctant sing</l>
     <l n="58">Of bliss that trembles on the verge of pain ,</l>
     <l n="59">While ‘ cellos plead and plead again ,</l>
     <l n="60">With throbbing notes delayed , that would impart</l>
     <l n="61">To every urgent tone the beating of the heart .</l>
     <l n="62">So runs the andante , making plain</l>
     <l n="63">The hopes and fears of love without a word .</l>
     <l n="64">Then comes the adagio , with a yielding theme</l>
     <l n="65">Through which the violas flow soft as in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="66">While horns and mild bassoons are heard</l>
     <l n="67">In tender tune , that seems to float</l>
     <l n="68">Like an enchanted boat</l>
     <l n="69">Upon the downward-gliding stream ,</l>
     <l n="70">Toward the allegro 's wide , bright sea</l>
     <l n="71">Of dancing , glittering , blending tone ,</l>
     <l n="72">Where every instrument is sounding free ,</l>
     <l n="73">And harps like wedding-chimes are rung , and trumpets blown</l>
     <l n="74">Around the barque of love</l>
     <l n="75">That rides , with smiling skies above ,</l>
     <l n="76">A royal galley , many-oared ,</l>
     <l n="77">Into the happy harbour of the perfect chord .</l>

     <l n="24">Floods of the human voice divine</l>
     <l n="25">Along the arch in choral song are rolled .</l>
     <l n="26">So bends the bow complete :</l>
     <l n="27">And radiant rapture flows</l>
     <l n="28">Across the bridge , so full , so strong , so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="29">That the uplifted spirit hardly knows</l>
     <l n="30">Whether the Music-Light that glows</l>
     <l n="31">Within the arch of tones and colours seven ,</l>

    <head>THE OLD FLUTE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The time will come when I no more can play</l>
     <l n="2">This polished flute : the stops will not obey</l>
     <l n="3">My gnarled fingers ; and the air it weaves</l>
     <l n="4">In modulations , like a vine with leaves</l>
     <l n="5">Climbing around the tower of song , will die</l>
     <l n="6">In rustling autumn rhythms , confused and dry .</l>
     <l n="7">My shortened breath no more will freely fill</l>
     <l n="8">This magic reed with melody at will ;</l>
     <l n="9">My stiffened lips will try and try in vain</l>
     <l n="10">To wake the liquid , leaping , dancing strain ;</l>
     <l n="11">The heavy notes will falter , wheeze , and faint ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or mock my ear with shrillness of complaint .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Then let me hang this faithful friend of mine</l>
     <l n="14">Upon the trunk of some old , sacred pine ,</l>

     <l n="16">To hear the viewless wind , that sings and soughs</l>
     <l n="17">Above me , play its wild , aerial lute ,</l>

     <l n="28">The universe with never silent waves ,—</l>
     <l n="29">Him will I thank that this brief breath of mine</l>
     <l n="30">Has caught one cadence of the song divine ;</l>
     <l n="31">And these frail fingers learned to rise and fall</l>
     <l n="32">In time with that great tune which throbs thro ’ all ;</l>
     <l n="33">And these poor lips have lent a lilt of joy</l>
     <l n="34">To songless men whom weary tasks employ !</l>
     <l n="35">My life has had its music , and my heart</l>
     <l n="36">In harmony has borne a little part ,</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TIME : 850 B. C .</head>
    <head>ACT I</head>
    <head>SCENE I</head>
    <head>Night , in the garden of NAAMAN at Damascus . At the left the palace , with softly gleaming lights and music coming from the open latticed windows . The garden is full of oleanders , roses , pomegranates , abundance of crimson flowers ; the air is heavy with their fragrance : a fountain at the right is plashing gently : behind it is an arbour covered with vines . Near the centre of the garden stands a small , hideous image of the god Rimmon . Beyond the arbour rises the lofty square tower of the House of Rimmon , which casts a shadow from the moon across the garden . The background is a wide , hilly landscape , with the snow-clad summit of Mount Herman in the distance . Enter by the palace door , the lady TSARPI , robed in red and gold , and followed by her maids , KHAMMA and NUBTA . She remains on the terrace : they go down into the garden , looking about , and returning to her .</head>
     <l n="1">KHAMMA :</l>
     <l n="2">There 's no one here ; the garden is asleep .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>NUBTA : The flowers are nodding , all the birds abed ,— Nothing awake except the watchful stars !</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : The stars are sentinels discreet and mute : How many things they know and never tell !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">TSARPI : [ Impatiently . ]</l>
     <l n="2">Unlike the stars , how many things you tell</l>
     <l n="3">And do not know ! When comes your master home ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>NUBTA : Lady , his armour-bearer brought us word ,— At moonset , not before .</p>
   <p>TSARPI : He haunts the camp And leaves me much alone ; yet I can pass The time of absence not unhappily , If I but know the time of his return . An hour of moonlight yet ! Khamma , my mirror ! These curls are ill arranged , this veil too low ,— So ,— that is better , careless maids ! Withdraw ,— But bring me word if Naaman appears !</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : Mistress , have no concern ; for when we hear The clatter of his horse along the street , We 'll run this way and lead your dancers down With song and laughter ,— you shall know in time .</p>
   <note>Exeunt KHAMMA and NUBTA laughing , TSARPI descends the steps .</note>
   <p>TSARPI : My guest is late ; but he will surely come ! The man who burns to drain the cup of love , The priest whose greed of glory never fails , Both , both have need of me , and he will come . And I ,— what do I need ? Why everything That helps my beauty to a higher throne ; All that a priest can promise , all a man Can give , and all a god bestow , I need : This may a woman win , and this will I .</p>
   <note>Enter REZON quietly from the shadow of the trees . He stands behind TSARPI and listens , smiling , to her last words . Then he drops his mantle of leopard-skin , and lifts his high priest 's rod of bronze , shaped at one end like a star .</note>
   <p>REZON : Tsarpi !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">TSARPI : [ Bowing low before him . ]</l>
     <l n="2">The mistress of the house of Naaman</l>
     <l n="3">Salutes the master of the House of Rimmon .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>REZON : Rimmon receives you with his star of peace , For you were once a handmaid of his altar .</p>
   <note>He lowers the star-point of the rod , which glows for a moment with rosy light above her head .</note>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And now the keeper of his temple asks</l>
     <l n="2">The welcome of the woman for the man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">TSARPI : [ Giving him her hand , but holding off his embrace . ]</l>
     <l n="4">No more ,— till I have heard what brings you here</l>
     <l n="5">By night , within the garden of the one</l>
     <l n="6">Who scorns you most and fears you least in all</l>
     <l n="7">Damascus .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>REZON : Trust me , I repay his scorn With double hatred ,— Naaman , the man Who stands against the nobles and the priests , This powerful fool , this impious devotee Of liberty , who loves the people more Than he reveres the city 's ancient god : This frigid husband who sets you below His dream of duty to a horde of slaves : This man I hate , and I will humble him .</p>
   <p>TSARPI : I think I hate him too . He stands apart From me , ev'n while he holds me in his arms , By something that I cannot understand . He swears he loves his wife next to his honour ! Next ? That 's too low ! I will be first or nothing .</p>
   <p>REZON : With me you are the first , the absolute ! When you and I have triumphed you shall reign ; And you and I will bring this hero down .</p>
   <p>TSARPI : But how ? For he is strong .</p>
   <p>REZON : By this , the hand Of Tsarpi ; and by this , the rod of Rimmon .</p>
   <p>TSARPI : Your plan ?</p>
   <p>REZON : You know the host of Nineveh Is marching now against us . Envoys come To bid us yield before a hopeless war . Our king is weak : the nobles , being rich , Would purchase peace to make them richer still : Only the people and the soldiers , led By Naaman , would fight for liberty . Blind fools ! To-day the envoys came to me , And talked with me in secret . Promises , Great promises ! For every noble house That urges peace , a noble recompense : The King , submissive , kept in royal state And splendour : most of all , honour and wealth Shall crown the House of Rimmon , and his priest ,— Yea , and his priestess ! For we two will rise Upon the city 's fall . The common folk Shall suffer ; Naaman shall sink with them In wreck ; but I shall rise , and you shall rise Above me ! You shall climb , through incense-smoke , And days of pomp , and nights of revelry , Unto the topmost room in Rimmon 's tower , The secret , lofty room , the couch of bliss , And the divine embraces of the god .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">TSARPI : [ Throwing out her arms in exultation . ]</l>
     <l n="2">All , all I wish ! What must I do for this ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">REZON :</l>
     <l n="4">Turn Naaman away from thoughts of war .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>TSARPI : But if I fail ? His will is proof against The lure of kisses and the wile of tears .</p>
   <p>REZON : Where woman fails , woman and priest succeed . Before the King decides , he must consult The oracle of Rimmon . This my hands Prepare ,— and you shall read the signs prepared In words of fear to melt the brazen heart Of Naaman .</p>
   <p>TSARPI : But if it flame instead ?</p>
   <p>REZON : I know a way to quench that flame . The cup , The parting cup your hand shall give to him ! What if the curse of Rimmon should infect That sacred wine with poison , secretly To work within his veins , week after week Corrupting all the currents of his blood , Dimming his eyes , wasting his flesh ? What then ? Would he prevail in war ? Would he come back To glory , or to shame ? What think you ?</p>
   <p>TSARPI : I ?— I do not think ; I only do my part . But can the gods bless this ?</p>
   <p>REZON : The gods can bless Whatever they decree ; their will makes right ; And this is for the glory of the House Of Rimmon ,— and for thee , my queen . Come , come ! The night grows dark : we 'll perfect our alliance .</p>
   <note>REZON draws her with him , embracing her , through the shadows of the garden . RUAHMAH , who has been sleeping in the arbour , has been awakened during the dialogue , and has been dimly visible in her white dress , behind the vines . She parts them and comes out , pushing back her long , dark hair from her temples .</note>
   <p>RUAHMAH : What have I heard ? O God , what shame is this Plotted beneath Thy pure and silent stars ! Was it for this that I was brought away A captive from the hills of Israel To serve the heathen in a land of lies ? Ah , treacherous , shameful priest ! Ah , shameless wife Of one too noble to suspect thy guilt ! The very greatness of his generous heart Betrays him to their hands . What can I do ! Nothing ,— a slave ,— hated and mocked by all My fellow-slaves ! O bitter prison-life ! I smother in this black , betraying air Of lust and luxury ; I faint beneath The shadow of this House of Rimmon . God Have mercy ! Lead me out to Israel . To Israel !</p>
   <note>Music and laughter heard within the palace . The doors fly open and a flood of men and women , dancers , players , flushed with wine , dishevelled , pour down the steps , KHAMMA and NUBTA with them . They crown the image with roses and dance around it . RUAHMAH is discovered crouching beside the arbour . They drag her out beside the image .</note>
   <p>NUBTA : Look ! Here 's the Hebrew maid ,— She 's homesick ; let us comfort her !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">KHAMMA : [ They put their arms around her . ]</l>
     <l n="2">Yes , dancing is the cure for homesickness .</l>
     <l n="3">We 'll make her dance .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">RUAHMAH : [ She slips away . ]</l>
     <l n="5">I pray you , let me go !</l>
     <l n="6">I cannot dance , I do not know your measures .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">KHAMMA :</l>
     <l n="8">Then sing for us ,— a song of Israel !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>RUAHMAH : How can I sing the songs of Israel In this strange country ? O my heart would break !</p>
   <p>A SERVANT : A stubborn and unfriendly maid ! We 'll whip her .</p>
   <note>They circle around her , striking her with rose-branches ; she sinks to her knees , covering her face with her bare arms , which bleed .</note>
   <p>NUBTA : Look , look ! She kneels to Rimmon , she is tamed .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">RUAHMAH : [ Springing up and lifting her arms . ]</l>
     <l n="2">Nay , not to this dumb idol , but to Him</l>
     <l n="3">Who made Orion and the seven stars !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ALL : She raves ,— she mocks at Rimmon ! Punish her ! The fountain ! Wash her blasphemy away !</p>
   <note>They push her toward the fountain , laughing and shouting . In the open door of the palace NAAMAN appears , dressed in blue and silver , bareheaded and unarmed . He comes to the top of the steps and stands for a moment , astonished and angry .</note>
   <p>NAAMAN : Silence ! What drunken rout is this ? Begone , Ye barking dogs and mewing cats ! Out , all ! Poor child , what have they done to thee ?</p>
   <note>Exeunt all except RUAHMAH , who stands with her face covered by her hands . NAAMAN comes to her , laying his hand on her shoulder .</note>

   <p>RUAHMAH : Master , good-night . And may thy slumber be as sweet and deep As if thou camped at snowy Hermon 's foot , Amid the music of his waterfalls . There friendly oak-trees bend their boughs above The weary head , pillowed on earth 's kind breast , And unpolluted breezes lightly breathe A song of sleep among the murmuring leaves . There the big stars draw nearer , and the sun Looks forth serene , undimmed by city 's mirk Or smoke of idol-temples , to behold The waking wonder of the wide-spread world . There life renews itself with every morn In purest joy of living . May the Lord Deliver thee , dear master , from the nets Laid for thy feet , and lead thee out along The open path , beneath the open sky !</p>

     <l n="1">TIME : The following morning</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The audience-hall in BENHADAD 'S palace . The sides of the hall are lined with lofty columns : the back opens toward the city , with descending steps : the House of Rimmon with its high tower is seen in the background . The throne is at the right in front : opposite is the royal door of entrance , guarded by four tall sentinels . Enter at the rear between the columns , RAKHAZ , SABALLIDIN , HAZAEL , IZDUBHAR .</p>
   <p>IZDUBHAR : [ An excited old man . ] The city is all in a turmoil . It boils like a pot of lentils . The people are foaming and bubbling round and round like beans in the pottage .</p>

     <l n="2">Fear is a hot fire .</l>

   <p>SABALLIDIN : He clatters like a windmill . What would he say , Hazael ?</p>
   <p>HAZAEL : Naaman can do nothing without the command of the King ; and the King fears to order the army to march without the approval of the gods . The High Priest is against it . The House of Rimmon is for peace with Asshur .</p>
   <p>RAKHAZ : Yes , and all the nobles are for peace . We are the men whose wisdom lights the rudder that upholds the chariot of state . Would we be rich if we were not wise ? Do we not know better than the rabble what medicine will silence this fire that threatens to drown us ?</p>
   <p>IZDUBHAR : But if the Assyrians come , we shall all perish ; they will despoil us all .</p>
   <p>HAZAEL : Not us , my lord , only the common people . The envoys have offered favourable terms to the priests , and the nobles , and the King . No palace , no temple , shall be plundered . Only the shops , and the markets , and the houses of the multitude shall be given up to the Bull . He will eat his supper from the pot of lentils , not from our golden plate .</p>
   <p>RAKHAZ : Yes , and all who speak for peace in the council shall be enriched ; our heads shall be crowned with seats of honour in the procession of the Assyrian king . He needs wise counsellors to help him guide the ship of empire onto the solid rock of prosperity . You must be with us , my lords Izdubhar and Saballidin , and let the stars of your wisdom roar loudly for peace .</p>
   <p>IZDUBHAR : He talks like a tablet read upside down ,— a wild ass braying in the wilderness . Yet there is policy in his words .</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : I know not . Can a kingdom live without a people or an army ? If we let the Bull in to sup on the lentils , will he not make his breakfast in our vineyards ?</p>
   <note>Enter other courtiers following SHUMAKIM , a hump-backed jester , in blue , green and red , a wreath of poppies around his neck and a flagon in his hand . He walks unsteadily , and stutters in his speech .</note>
   <p>HAZAEL : Here is Shumakim , the King 's fool , with his legs full of last night 's wine .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : [ Balancing himself in front of them and chuckling . ] Wrong , my lords , very wrong ! This is not last night 's wine , but a draught the King 's physician gave me this morning for a cure . It sobers me amazingly ! I know you all , my lords : any fool would know you . You , master , are a statesman ; and you are a politician ; and you are a patriot .</p>
   <p>RAKHAZ : Am I a statesman ? I felt something of the kind about me . But what is a statesman ?</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : A politician that is stuffed with big words ; a fat man in a mask ; one that plays a solemn tune on a sackbut full o ’ wind .</p>
   <p>HAZAEL : And what is a politician ?</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : A statesman that has dropped his mask and cracked his sackbut . Men trust him for what he is , and he never deceives them , because he always lies .</p>
   <p>IZDUBHAR : Why do you call me a patriot ?</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : Because you know what is good for you ; you love your country as you love your pelf . You feel for the common people ,— as the wolf feels for the sheep .</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : And what am I ?</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : A fool , master , just a plain fool ; and there is hope of thee for that reason . Embrace me , brother , and taste this ; but not too much ,— it will intoxicate thee with sobriety .</p>
   <note>The hall has been slowly filling with courtiers and soldiers ; a crowd of people begin to come up the steps at the rear , where they are halted by a chain guarded by servants of the palace . A bell tolls ; the royal door is thrown open ; the aged King totters across the hall and takes his seat on the throne with the four tall sentinels standing behind him . All bow down shading their eyes with their hands .</note>
   <p>BENHADAD : The hour of royal audience is come . I 'll hear the envoys . Are my counsellors At hand ? Where are the priests of Rimmon 's house ?</p>
   <note>Gongs sound . REZON comes in from the side , followed by a procession of priests in black and yellow . The courtiers bow ; the King rises ; REZON takes his stand on the steps of the throne at the left of the King .</note>
   <p>BENHADAD : Where is my faithful servant Naaman , The captain of my host ?</p>
   <note>Trumpets sound from the city . The crowd on the steps divide ; the chain is lowered ; NAAMAN enters , followed by six soldiers . He is dressed in chain-mail with a silver helmet and a cloak of blue . He uncovers , and kneels on the steps of the throne at the King 's right .</note>

   <note>Gongs and cymbals sound : enter priests carrying an altar on which a lamb is bound . The altar is placed in the centre of the hall . TSARPI follows the priests , covered with a long transparent veil of black , sown with gold stars ; RUAHMAH , in white , bears her train . TSARPI stands before the altar , facing it , and lifts her right hand holding a knife . RUAHMAH steps back , near the throne , her hands crossed on her breast , her head bowed .

     <l n="4">I will smite with vengeance him who dares defy me !</l>
     <l n="5">He who leads Damascus into war with Asshur ,</l>

   <p>RUAHMAH : Be not afraid ! There is a greater God Shall cover thee with His almighty wings : Beneath his shield and buckler shalt thou trust .</p>
   <p>BENHADAD : Repent , my son , thou must not brave this curse .</p>
   <p>NAAMAN : My King , there is no curse as terrible As that which lights a bosom-fire for him Who gives away his honour , to prolong A craven life whose every breath is shame ! If I betray the men who follow me , The city that has put her trust in me , What king can shield me from my own deep scorn What god release me from that self-made hell ? The tender mercies of Assyria I know ; and they are cruel as creeping tigers . Give up Damascus , and her streets will run Rivers of innocent blood ; the city 's heart , That mighty , labouring heart , wounded and crushed Beneath the brutal hooves of the wild Bull , Will cry against her captain , sitting safe Among the nobles , in some pleasant place . I shall be safe ,— safe from the threatened wrath Of unknown gods , but damned forever by The men I know ,— that is the curse I fear .</p>
   <p>BENHADAD : Speak not so high , my son . Must we not bow Our heads before the sovereignties of heaven ? The unseen rulers are Divine .</p>
   <p>NAAMAN : O King , I am unlearned in the lore of priests ; Yet well I know that there are hidden powers About us , working mortal weal and woe Beyond the force of mortals to control . And if these powers appear in love and truth , I think they must be gods , and worship them . But if their secret will is manifest In blind decrees of sheer omnipotence , That punish where no fault is found , and smite The poor with undeserved calamity , And pierce the undefended in the dark With arrows of injustice , and foredoom The innocent to burn in endless pain , I will not call this fierce almightiness Divine . Though I must bear , with every man , The burden of my life ordained , I 'll keep My soul unterrified , and tread the path Of truth and honour with a steady heart ! Have ye not heard , my lords ? The oracle Proclaims to me , to me alone , the doom Of vengeance if I lead the army out . “ Conquered or conquering ! ” I grip that chance ! Damascus free , her foes all beaten back , The people saved from slavery , the King Upheld in honour on his ancient throne ,— O what 's the cost of this ? I 'll gladly pay Whatever gods there be , whatever price They ask for this one victory . Give me This gilded sign of shame to carry back ; I 'll shake it in the face of Asshur 's king , And break it on his teeth .</p>

     <l n="1">TIME : A week later</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The fore-court of the House of Rimmon . At the back the broad steps and double doors of the shrine ; above them the tower of the god , its summit invisible . Enter various groups of citizens , talking , laughing , shouting : RAKHAZ , HAZAEL , SHUMAKIM and others .</p>
   <p>FIRST CITIZEN : Great news , glorious news , the Assyrians are beaten !</p>
   <p>SECOND CITIZEN : Naaman is returning , crowned with victory . Glory to our noble captain !</p>
   <p>THIRD CITIZEN : No , he is killed . I had it from one of the camp-followers who saw him fall at the head of the battle . They are bringing his body to bury it with honour . O sorrowful victory !</p>
   <p>RAKHAZ : Peace , my good fellows , you are ignorant , you have not been rightly informed , I will misinform you . The accounts of Naaman 's death are overdrawn . He was killed , but his life has been preserved . One of his wounds was mortal , but the other three were curable , and by these the physicians have saved him .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : [ Balancing himself before RAKHAZ in pretended admiration . ] O wonderful ! Most admirable logic ! One mortal , and three curable , therefore he must recover as it were , by three to one . Rakhaz , do you know that you are a marvelous man ?</p>
   <p>RAKHAZ : Yes , I know it , but I make no boast of my knowledge .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : Too modest , for in knowing this you know more than any other in Damascus !</p>
   <note>Enter , from the right , SABALLIDIN in armour : from the left , TSARPI with her attendants , among whom is RUAHMAH .</note>
   <p>HAZAEL : Here is Saballidin , we 'll question him ; He was enflamed by Naaman 's wild words , And rode with him to battle . Give us news , Of your great captain ! Is he safe and well ? When will he come ? Or will he come at all ?</p>
   <note>All gather around him listening eagerly .</note>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : He comes but now , returning from the field Where he hath gained a crown of deathless fame ! Three times he led the charge ; three times he fell Wounded , and the Assyrians beat us back . Yet every wound was but a spur to urge His valour onward . In the last attack He rode before us as the crested wave That leads the flood ; and lo , our enemies Were broken like a dam of river-reeds . The flying King encircled by his guard Was lodged like driftwood on a little hill . Then Naaman , who led our foremost band Of whirlwind riders , hammered through the hedge Of spearmen , brandishing the golden yoke . “ Take back this gift , ” he cried ; and shattered it On Shalmaneser 's helmet . So the fight Dissolved in universal rout ; the King , His chariots and his horsemen fled away ; Our captain stood the master of the field , And saviour of Damascus ! Now he brings , First to the King , report of this great triumph .</p>

    <head>ACT III</head>
     <l n="1">TIME : A month later : dawn</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SCENE I</p>
   <p>NAAMAN 'S tent , on high ground among the mountains near Samaria : the city below . In the distance , a wide and splendid landscape . SABALLIDIN and soldiers on guard below the tent . Enter RUAHMAH in hunter 's dress , with a lute slung from her shoulder .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Peace and good health to you , Saballidin . Good morrow to you all . How fares my lord ?</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : The curtains of his tent are folded still : They have not moved since we returned , last night , And told him what befell us in the city .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Told him ! Why did you make report to him And not to me ? Am I not captain here , Intrusted by the King 's command with care Of Naaman until he is restored ? ‘ Tis mine to know the first of good or ill In this adventure : mine to shield his heart From every arrow of adversity . What have you told him ? Speak !</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : Lady , we feared To bring our news to you . For when the King Of Israel had read our monarch 's letter , He rent his clothes , and cried , “ Am I a god , To kill and make alive , that I should heal A leper ? Ye have come with false pretence , Damascus seeks a quarrel with me . Go ! ” But when we told our lord , he closed his tent , And there remains enfolded in his grief . I trust he sleeps ; ‘ twere kind to let him sleep ! For now he doth forget his misery , And all the burden of his hopeless woe Is lifted from him by the gentle hand Of slumber . Oh , to those bereft of hope Sleep is the only blessing left ,— the last Asylum of the weary , the one sign Of pity from impenetrable heaven . Waking is strife ; sleep is the truce of God ! Ah , lady , wake him not . The day will be Full long for him to suffer , and for us To turn our disappointed faces home On the long road by which we must return .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Return ! Who gave you that command ? Not I ! The King made me the leader of this quest , And bound you all to follow me , because He knew I never would return without The thing for which he sent us . I 'll go on Day after day , unto the uttermost parts Of earth , if need be , and beyond the gates Of morning , till I find that which I seek ,— New life for Naaman . Are ye ashamed To have a woman lead you ? Then go back And tell the King , “ This huntress went too far For us to follow : she pursues the trail Of hope alone , refusing to forsake The quarry : we grew weary of the chase ; And so we left her and retraced our steps , Like faithless hounds , to sleep beside the fire . ” Did Naaman forsake his soldiers thus When you went forth to hunt the Assyrian Bull ? Your manly courage is less durable Than woman 's love , it seems . Go , if you will ,— Who bids me now farewell ?</p>
   <p>SOLDIERS : Not I , not I !</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : Lady , lead on , we 'll follow you forever !</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Why , now you speak like men ! Brought you no word Out of Samaria , except that cry Of impotence and fear from Israel 's King ?</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : I do remember while he spoke with us A rustic messenger came in , and cried “ Elisha saith , bring Naaman to me At Dothan , he shall surely know there is A God in Israel . ”</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : What said the King ?</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : He only shouted “ Go ! ” more wildly yet , And rent his clothes again , as if he were Half-maddened by a coward 's fear , and thought Only of how he might be rid of us . What comfort could there be for him , what hope For us , in the rude prophet 's misty word ?</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : It is the very word for which I prayed ! My trust was not in princes ; for the crown , The sceptre , and the purple robe are not Significant of vital power . The man Who saves his brother-men is he who lives His life with Nature , takes deep hold on truth , And trusts in God . A prophet 's word is more Than all the kings on earth can speak . How far Is Dothan ?</p>
   <p>SOLDIER : Lady , ‘ tis but three hours ’ ride Along the valley southward .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Near ! so near ? I had not thought to end my task so soon ! Prepare yourselves with speed to take the road . I will awake my lord .</p>
   <note>Exeunt all but SABALLIDIN and RUAHMAH . She goes toward the tent .</note>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : Ruahmah , stay ! [ She turns back . ] I 've been your servant in this doubtful quest , Obedient , faithful , loyal to your will ,— What have I earned by this ?</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : The gratitude Of him we both desire to serve : your friend ,— My master and my lord .</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : No more than this ?</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Yes , if you will , take all the thanks my hands Can hold , my lips can speak .</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : I would have more .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : My friend , there 's nothing more to give to you . My service to my lord is absolute . There 's not a drop of blood within my veins But quickens at the very thought of him ; And not a dream of mine but he doth stand Within its heart and make it bright . No man To me is other than his friend or foe . You are his friend , and I believe you true !</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : I have been true to him ,— now , I am true To you .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Why , then , be doubly true to him . O let us match our loyalties , and strive Between us who shall win the higher crown ! Men boast them of a friendship stronger far Than love of woman . Prove it ! I 'll not boast , But I 'll contend with you on equal terms In this brave race : and if you win the prize I 'll hold you next to him : and if I win He 'll hold you next to me ; and either way We 'll not be far apart . Do you accept My challenge ?</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : Yes ! For you enforce my heart By honour to resign its great desire , And love itself to offer sacrifice Of all disloyal dreams on its own altar . Yet love remains ; therefore I pray you , think How surely you must lose in our contention . For I am known to Naaman : but you He blindly takes for Tsarpi . ‘ Tis to her He gives his gratitude : the praise you win Endears her name .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Her name ? Why , what is that ? A name is but an empty shell , a mask That does not change the features of the face Beneath it . Can a name rejoice , or weep , Or hope ? Can it be moved by tenderness To daily services of love , or feel the warmth Of dear companionship ? How many things We call by names that have no meaning ! Kings That cannot rule ; and gods that are not good ; And wives that do not love ! It matters not What syllables he utters when he calls , ‘ Tis I who come ,— ‘ tis I who minister Unto my lord , and mine the living heart That feels the comfort of his confidence , The thrill of gladness when he speaks to me ,— I do not hear the name !</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : And yet , be sure There 's danger in this error ,— and no gain !</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : I seek no gain : I only tread the path Marked for me daily by the hand of love . And if his blindness spared my lord one pang Of sorrow in his black , forsaken hour ,— And if this error makes his burdened heart More quiet , and his shadowed way less dark , Whom do I rob ? Not her who chose to stay At ease in Rimmon 's House ! Surely not him ! Only myself ! And that enriches me . Why trouble we the master ? Let it go ,— To-morrow he must know the truth ,— and then He shall dispose of me e'en as he will !</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : To-morrow ?</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Yes , for I will tarry here , While you conduct him to Elisha 's house To find the promised healing . I forebode A sudden danger from the craven King Of Israel , or else a secret ambush From those who hate us in Damascus . Go , But leave me twenty men : this mountain-pass Protects the road behind you . Make my lord Obey the prophet 's word , whatever he commands , And come again in peace . Farewell !</p>
   <note>Exit SABALLIDIN . RUAHMAH goes toward the tent , then pauses and turns back . She takes her lute and sings .</note>

   <p>NAAMAN : Thy voice is magical : thy words are visions ! I must content myself with them , for now My only hope is lost : Samaria 's King Rejects our monarch 's message ,— hast thou heard ? “ Am I a god that I should cure a leper ? ” He sends me home unhealed , with angry words , Back to Damascus and the lingering death .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : What matter where he sends ? No god is he To slay or make alive . Elisha bids You come to him at Dothan , there to learn There is a God in Israel .</p>
   <p>NAAMAN : I fear That I am grown mistrustful of all gods ; Their secret counsels are implacable .</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Fear not ! There 's One who rules in righteousness High over all .</p>
   <p>NAAMAN : What knowest thou of Him ?</p>

   <p>NAAMAN : If there were such a God , I 'd worship Him Forever !</p>
   <p>RUAHMAH : Then make haste to hear the word His prophet promises to speak to thee ! Obey it , my dear lord , and thou shalt find Healing and peace . The light shall fill thine eyes . Thou wilt not need my leading any more ,— Nor me ,— for thou wilt see me , all unveiled ,— I tremble at the thought .</p>

    <head>SCENE II<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></head>
    <head>The house of Elisha , upon a terraced hillside . A low stone cottage with vine-trellises and flowers ; a flight of steps , at the foot of which is NAAMAN 'S chariot . He is standing in it ; SABALLIDIN beside it . Two soldiers come down the steps .</head>
     <l n="1">FIRST SOLDIER :</l>
     <l n="2">We have delivered my lord 's greeting and his message .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SECOND SOLDIER : Yes , and near lost our noses in the doing of it ! For the servant slammed the door in our faces . A most unmannerly reception !</p>
   <p>FIRST SOLDIER : But I take that as a good omen . It is a mark of holy men to keep ill-conditioned servants . Look , the door opens , the prophet is coming .</p>
   <p>SECOND SOLDIER : No , by my head , it is that notable mark of his master 's holiness , that same lantern-jawed lout of a servant .</p>
   <note>GEHAZI loiters down the steps and comes to NAAMAN with a slight obeisance .</note>
   <p>GEHAZI : My master , the prophet of Israel , sends word to Naaman the Syrian ,— are you he ?— -  “ Go wash in Jordan seven times and be healed . ”</p>
   <note>GEHAZI turns and goes slowly up the steps .</note>
   <p>NAAMAN : What insolence is this ? Am I a man To be put off with surly messengers ? Has not Damascus rivers more renowned Than this rude muddy Jordan ? Crystal streams , Abana ! Pharpar ! flowing smoothly through A paradise of roses ? Might I not Have bathed in them and been restored at ease ? Come up , Saballidin , and guide me home !</p>
   <p>SABALLIDIN : Bethink thee , master , shall we lose our quest Because a servant is uncouth ? The road That seeks the mountain leads us through the vale . The prophet 's word is friendly after all ; For had it been some mighty task he set , Thou wouldst perform it . How much rather then This easy one ? Hast thou not promised her Who waits for thy return ? Wilt thou go back To her unhealed ?</p>
   <p>NAAMAN : No ! not for all my pride ! I 'll make myself most humble for her sake , And stoop to anything that gives me hope Of having her . Make haste , Saballidin , Bring me to Jordan . I will cast myself Into that river 's turbulent embrace A hundred times , until I save my life Or lose it !</p>
   <note>Exeunt . The light fades : musical interlude . The light increases again with ruddy sunset shining on the door of ELISHA 'S house . The prophet appears and looks off , shading his eyes with his hand as he descends the steps . Trumpet blows ,— NAAMAN 'S call ;— sound of horses galloping and men shouting . NAAMAN enters joyously , followed by SABALLIDIN and soldiers , with gifts .</note>
   <p>NAAMAN : Behold a man delivered from the grave By thee ! I rose from Jordan 's waves restored To youth and vigour , as the eagle mounts Upon the sunbeam and renews his strength ! O mighty prophet deign to take from me These gifts too poor to speak my gratitude ; Silver and gold and jewels , damask robes ,—</p>

     <l n="4">Whose mercy hath redeemed thee from thy plague .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>NAAMAN : He is the only God ! I worship Him ! Grant me a portion of the blessed soil Of this most favoured land where I have found His mercy ; in Damascus will I build An altar to His name , and praise Him there Morning and night . There is no other God In all the world .</p>
   <p>ELISHA : Thou needst not This load of earth to build a shrine for Him ; Yet take it if thou wilt . But be assured God 's altar is in every loyal heart , And every flame of love that kindles there Ascends to Him and brightens with His praise . There is no other God ! But evil Powers Make war against Him in the darkened world ; And many temples have been built to them .</p>
   <p>NAAMAN : I know them well ! Yet when my master goes To worship in the House of Rimmon , I Must enter with him ; for he trusts me , leans Upon my hand ; and when he bows himself I cannot help but make obeisance too ,— But not to Rimmon ! To my country 's King I 'll bow in love and honour . Will the Lord Pardon thy servant in this thing ?</p>
   <p>ELISHA : My son , Peace has been granted thee . ‘ Tis thine to find The only way to keep it . Go in peace .</p>
   <p>NAAMAN : Thou hast not answered me ,— may I bow down ?</p>
   <p>ELISHA : The answer must be thine . The heart that knows The perfect peace of gratitude and love , Walks in the light and needs no other rule . When next thou comest into Rimmon 's House , Thy heart will tell thee how to go in peace .</p>

   <p>ACT IV</p>
   <p>SCENE I</p>
   <p>The interior of NAAMAN 'S tent , at night . RUAHMAH alone , sleeping on the ground . A vision appears to her through the curtains of the tent : ELISHA standing on the hillside at Dothan : NAAMAN , restored to sight , comes in and kneels before him . ELISHA blesses him , and he goes out rejoicing . The vision of the prophet turns to RUAHMAH and lifts his hand in warning .</p>
   <p>ELISHA : Daughter of Israel , what dost thou here ? Thy prayer is granted . Naaman is healed : Mar not true service with a selfish thought . Nothing remains for thee to do , except Give thanks , and go whither the Lord commands . Obey ,— obey ! Ere Naaman returns Thou must depart to thine own house in Shechem .</p>

    <head>SCENE II</head>
     <l n="1">TIME : Three days later</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Inner court of the House of Rimmon ; a temple with huge pillars at each side . In the right foreground the seat of the King ; at the left , of equal height , the seat of the High Priest . In the background a broad flight of steps , rising to a curtain of cloudy gray , embroidered with two gigantic hands holding thunderbolts . The temple is in half darkness at first . Enter KHAMMA and NUBTA , robed as Kharimati , or religious dancers , in gowns of black gauze with yellow embroideries and mantles .</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : All is ready for the rites of worship ; our lady will play a great part in them . She has put on her Tyrian robes , and all her ornaments .</p>
   <p>NUBTA : That is a sure sign of a religious purpose . She is most devout , our lady Tsarpi !</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : A favourite of Rimmon , too ! The High Priest has assured her of it . He is a great man ,— next to the King , now that Naaman is gone .</p>
   <p>NUBTA : But if Naaman should come back , healed of the leprosy ?</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : How can he come back ? The Hebrew slave that went away with him , when they caught her , said that he was dead . The High Priest has shut her up in the prison of the temple , accusing her of her master 's death .</p>
   <p>NUBTA : Yet I think he does not believe it , for I heard him telling our mistress what to do if Naaman should return .</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : What , then ?</p>
   <p>NUBTA : She will claim him as her husband . Was she not wedded to him before the god ? That is a sacred bond . Only the High Priest can loose it . She will keep her hold on Naaman for the sake of the House of Rimmon . A wife knows her husband 's secrets , she can tell —</p>
   <note>Enter SHUMAKIM , with his flagon , walking unsteadily .</note>
   <p>KHAMMA : Hush ! here comes the fool Shumakim . He is never sober .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : [ Laughing . ] Are there two of you ? I see two , but that is no proof . I think there is only one , but beautiful enough for two . What were you talking to yourself about , fairest one !</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : About the lady Tsarpi , fool , and what she would do if her husband returned .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : Fie ! fie ! That is no talk for an innocent fool to hear . Has she a husband ?</p>
   <p>NUBTA : You know very well that she is the wife of Lord Naaman .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : I remember that she used to wear his name and his jewels . But I thought he had exchanged her ,— for a leprosy .</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : You must have heard that he went away to Samaria to look for healing . Some say that he died on the journey ; but others say he has been cured , and is on his way home to his wife .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : It may be , for this is a mad world , and men never know when they are well off ,— except us fools . But he must come soon if he would find his wife as he parted from her ,— or the city where he left it . The Assyrians have returned with a greater army , and this time they will make an end of us . There is no Naaman now , and the Bull will devour Damascus like a bunch of leeks , flowers and all ,— flowers and all , my double-budded fair one ! Are you not afraid ?</p>
   <p>NUBTA : We belong to the House of Rimmon . He will protect us .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : What ? The mighty one who hides behind the curtain there , and tells his secrets to Rezon ? No doubt he will take care of you , and of himself . Whatever game is played , the gods never lose . But for the protection of the common people and the rest of us fools , I would rather have Naaman at the head of an army than all the sacred images between here and Babylon .</p>
   <p>KHAMMA : You are a wicked old man . You mock the god . He will punish you .</p>
   <p>SHUMAKIM : [ Bitterly . ] How can he punish me ? Has he not already made me a fool ? Hark , here comes my brother the High Priest , and my brother the King . Rimmon made us all ; but nobody knows who made Rimmon , except the High Priest ; and he will never tell .</p>
   <note>Gongs and cymbals sound . Enter REZON with priests , and the King with courtiers . They take their seats . A throng of Khali and Kharimati come in , TSARPI presiding ; a sacred dance is performed with torches , burning incense , and chanting , in which TSARPI leads .</note>

   <p>BENHADAD : Peace , peace ! The King commands all weapons down ! O Naaman , what wouldst thou do ? Beware Lest thou provoke the anger of a god .</p>
   <p>NAAMAN : There is no God but one , the Merciful , Who gave this perfect woman to my soul That I might learn through her to worship Him , And know the meaning of immortal Love .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">BENHADAD : [ Agitated . ]</l>
     <l n="2">Yet she is consecrated , bound , and doomed</l>
     <l n="3">To sacrificial death ; but thou art sworn</l>
     <l n="4">To live and lead my host ,— Hast thou not sworn ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>NAAMAN : Only if thou wilt keep thy word to me ! Break with this idol of iniquity Whose shadow makes a darkness in the land ; Give her to me who gave me back to thee ; And I will lead thine army to renown And plant thy banners on the hill of triumph . But if she dies , I die with her , defying Rimmon .</p>
   <note>Cries of “ Spare them ! Release her ! Give us back our Captain ! ” and “ Sacrilege ! Let them die ! ” Then silence , all turning toward the King .</note>
   <p>BENHADAD : Is this the choice ? Must we destroy the bond Of ancient faith , or slay the city 's living hope ! I am an old , old man ,— and yet the King ! Must I decide ?— O let me ponder it !</p>
   <note>His head sinks upon his breast . All stand eagerly looking at him .</note>
   <p>NAAMAN : Ruahmah , my Ruahmah ! I have come To thee at last ! And art thou satisfied ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">RUAHMAH : [ Looking into his face . ]</l>
     <l n="2">Belovéd , my belovéd , I am glad</l>
     <l n="3">Of all , and glad for ever , come what may .</l>
     <l n="4">Nothing can harm me ,— since my lord is come !</l>

    <p n="1">CARMINA FESTIVA</p>
    <p n="2">THE LITTLE-NECK CLAM</p>
    <p n="3">A modern verse-sequence , showing how a native American subject , strictly realistic , may be treated in various manners adapted to the requirements of different magazines , thus combining Art-for-Art'shYpppHeNSake with Writing-for-the-Market . Read at the First Dinner of the American Periodical Publishers ’ Association , in Washington , April , 1904 .</p>

    <p n="5">THE ANTI-TRUST CLAM</p>
    <p n="6">For McClure 's Magazine</p>
    <p n="7">The clam that once , on Jersey 's banks , Was like the man who dug it , free , Now slave-like thro ’ the market clanks In chains of corporate tyranny .</p>
    <p n="8">The Standard Fish-Trust of New York Holds every clam-bank in control ; And like base Beef and menial Pork , The free-born Clam has lost its soul .</p>
    <p n="9">No more the bivalve treads the sands In freedom 's rapture , free from guilt : It follows now the harsh commands Of Morgiman and Rockabilt .</p>
    <p n="10">Rise , freemen , rise ! Your wrath is just ! Call on the Sherman Act to dam The floods of this devouring Trust , And liberate the fettered Clam .</p>

    <p n="12">THE WHITMANIAC CLAM</p>
    <p n="13">For the Bookman</p>
    <p n="14">Not Dante when he wandered by the river Arno , Not Burns who plowed the banks and braes of bonnie Ayr , Not even Shakspere on the shores of Avon ,— ah , no ! Not one of those great bards did taste true Poet 's Fare .</p>
    <p n="15">But Whitman , loafing in Long Island and New Jersey , Found there the sustenance of mighty ode and psalm , And while his rude emotions swam around in verse , he Fed chiefly on the wild , impassioned , sea-born clam .</p>
    <p n="16">Thus in his work we feel the waves ’ bewildering motion , And winds from mighty mud-flats , weird and wild : His clam-filled bosom answered to the voice of ocean , And rose and fell responsively with every tide .</p>

    <p n="18">IL MERCATORE ITALIANO DELLA CLAMMA</p>
    <p n="19">For the Century Magazine</p>
    <p n="20">“ Clam O ! Fres ’ Clam ! ” How strange it sounds and sweet , The Dago 's cry along the New York street ! “ Dago ” we call him , like the thoughtless crowd ; And yet this humble man may well be proud To hail from Petrarch 's land , Boccaccio 's home ,— Firenze , Gubbio , Venezia , Rome ,— From fair Italia , whose enchanted soil Transforms the lowly cotton-seed to olive-oil .</p>
    <p n="21">To me his chant , with alien accent sung , Brings back an echo of great Virgil 's tongue : It seems to cry against the city 's woe , In liquid Latin syllables ,— Clamo ! As thro ’ the crowded street his cart he jams And cries aloud , ah , think of more than clams ! Receive his secret plaint with pity warm , And grant Italia 's plea for Tenement-House Reform !</p>
    <p n="22">IV</p>
    <p n="23">THE SOCIAL CLAM</p>
    <p n="24">For the Smart Set</p>
    <p n="25">Fair Phyllis is another 's bride : Therefore I like to sit beside Her at a very smart set dinner , And whisper love , and try to win her .</p>
    <p n="26">The little-necks ,— in number six ,— That from their pearly shells she picks And swallows whole ,— ah , is it selfish To wish my heart among those shell-fish ?</p>
    <p n="27">“ But Phyllis is another 's wife ; And if she should absorb thy life ‘ Twould leave thy bosom vacant . ” — Well , I 'd keep at least the empty shell !</p>
    <p n="28">V</p>
    <p n="29">THE RECREANT CLAM</p>
    <p n="30">For the Outlook</p>
    <p n="31">Low dost thou lie amid the languid ooze , Because thy slothful spirit doth refuse The bliss of battle and the strain of strife . Rise , craven clam , and lead the strenuous life !</p>
    <p n="32">A FAIRY TALE</p>
    <p n="33">For the Mark Twain Dinner , December 5 , 1905</p>
    <p n="34">Some three-score years and ten ago A prince was born at Florida , Mo . ; And though he came incognito , With just the usual yells of woe , The watchful fairies seemed to know Precisely what the row meant ; For when he was but five days old , ( December fifth as I 've been told ,) They pattered through the midnight cold , And came around his crib , to hold A “ Council of Endowment . ”</p>
    <p n="35">“ I give him Wit , ” the eldest said , And stooped above the little bed , To touch his forehead round and red . “ Within this bald , unfurnished head , Where wild luxuriant locks shall spread And wave in years hereafter , I kindle now the lively spark , That still shall flash by day and dark , And everywhere he goes shall mark His way with light and laughter . ”</p>
    <p n="36">The fairies laughed to think of it That such a rosy , wrinkled bit Of flesh should be endowed with Wit ! But something serious seemed to hit The mind of one , as if a fit Of fear had come upon her . “ I give him Truth , ” she quickly cried , “ That laughter may not lead aside To paths where scorn and falsehood hide ,— I give him Truth and Honour ! ”</p>
    <p n="37">“ I give him Love , ” exclaimed the third ; And as she breathed the mystic word , I know not if the baby heard , But softly in his dream he stirred , And twittered like a little bird , And stretched his hands above him . The fairy 's gift was sealed and signed With kisses twain the deed to bind : “ A heart of love to human-kind , And human-kind to love him ! ”</p>
    <p n="38">“ Now stay your giving ! ” cried the Queen . “ These gifts are passing rich I ween ; And if reporters should be mean Enough to spy upon this scene , ‘ Twould make all other babies green With envy at the rumour . Yet since I love this child , forsooth , I 'll mix your gifts , Wit , Love and Truth , With spirits of Immortal Youth , And call the mixture Humour ! ”</p>
    <p n="39">The fairies vanished with their glittering train ; But here 's the Prince with all their gifts ,— Mark Twain .</p>
    <p n="40">THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS</p>
    <p n="41">Recited at the Century Club , New York : Twelfth Night . 1906</p>
    <p n="42">Come all ye good Centurions and wise men of the times , You 've made a Poet Laureate , now you must hear his rhymes . Extend your ears and I 'll respond by shortening up my tale :— Man cannot live by verse alone , he must have cakes and ale .</p>
    <p n="43">So while you wait for better things and muse on schnapps and salad , I 'll try my Pegasus his wings and sing a little ballad : A legend of your ancestors , the Wise Men of the East , Who brought among their baggage train a quaint and curious beast .</p>
    <p n="44">Their horses were both swift and strong , and we should think it lucky If we could buy , by telephone , such horses from Kentucky ; Their dromedaries paced along , magnificent and large , Their camels were as stately as if painted by La Farge .</p>
    <p n="45">But this amazing little ass was never satisfied , He made more trouble every day than all the rest beside : His ears were long , his legs were short , his eyes were bleared and dim , But nothing in the wide , wide world was good enough for him .</p>
    <p n="46">He did not like the way they went , but lifted up his voice And said that any other way would be a better choice . He braced his feet and stood his ground , and made the wise men wait , While with his heels at all around he did recalcitrate .</p>
    <p n="47">It mattered not how fair the land through which the road might run , He found new causes for complaint with every Morning Sun : And when the shades of twilight fell and all the world grew nappy , They tied him to his Evening Post , but still he was not happy .</p>
    <p n="48">He thought his load was far too large , he thought his food was bad , He thought the Star a poor affair , he thought the Wise Men mad : He did not like to hear them laugh ,— ‘ twas childish to be jolly ; And if perchance they sang a hymn ,— ‘ twas sentimental folly !</p>
    <p n="49">So day by day this little beast performed his level best To make their life , in work and play , a burden to the rest : And when they laid them down at night , he would not let them sleep , But criticized the Universe with hee-haws loud and deep .</p>
    <p n="50">One evening , as the Wise Men sat before their fire-lit tent , And ate and drank and talked and sang , in grateful merriment , The solemn donkey butted in , in his most solemn way , And broke the happy meeting up with a portentous bray .</p>
    <p n="51">“ Now by my head , ” Balthazar said ( his real name was Choate ) , “ We 've had about enough of this ! I 'll put it to the vote . I move the donkey be dismissed ; let 's turn him out to grass , And travel on our cheerful way , without the solemn ass . ”</p>
    <p n="52">The vote was aye ! and with a whack the Wise Men drove him out ; But still he wanders up and down , and all the world about ; You 'll know him by his long , sad face and supercilious ways , And likewise by his morning kicks and by his evening brays .</p>
    <p n="53">But while we sit at Eagle Roost and make our Twelfth Night cheer , Full well we know the solemn ass will not disturb us here : For pleasure rules the roost to-night , by order of the King , And every one must play his part , and laugh , and likewise sing .</p>
    <p n="54">The road of life is long , we know , and often hard to find , And yet there 's many a pleasant turn for men of cheerful mind : We 've done our day 's work honestly , we 've earned the right to rest , We 'll take a cup of friendship now and spice it with a jest .</p>
    <p n="55">A silent health to absent friends , their memories are bright ! A hearty health to all who keep the feast with us to-night ! A health to dear Centuria , oh , may she long abide ! A health , a health to all the world ,— and the solemn ass , outside !</p>
    <p n="56">A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS</p>
    <p n="57">For the St. Nicholas Society of New York</p>
    <p n="58">Among the earliest saints of old , before the first Hegira , I find the one whose name we hold , St. Nicholas of Myra : The best-beloved name , I guess , in sacred nomenclature ,— The patron-saint of helpfulness , and friendship , and good-nature .</p>
    <p n="59">A bishop and a preacher too , a famous theologian , He stood against the Arian crew and fought them like a Trojan : But when a poor man told his need and begged an alms in trouble , He never asked about his creed , but quickly gave him double .</p>
    <p n="60">Three pretty maidens , so they say , were longing to be married ; But they were paupers , lack-a-day , and so the suitors tarried . St. Nicholas gave each maid a purse of golden ducats chinking , And then , for better or for worse , they wedded quick as winking .</p>
    <p n="61">Once , as he sailed , a storm arose ; wild waves the ship surrounded ; The sailors wept and tore their clothes , and shrieked “ We 'll all be drownded ! ” St. Nicholas never turned a hair ; serenely shone his halo ; He simply said a little prayer , and all the billows lay low .</p>
    <p n="62">The wicked keeper of an inn had three small urchins taken , And cut them up in a pickle-bin , and salted them for bacon . St. Nicholas came and picked them out , and put their limbs together ,— They lived , they leaped , they gave a shout , “ St. Nicholas forever ! ”</p>
    <p n="63">And thus it came to pass , you know , that maids without a nickel , And sailor-lads when tempest blow , and children in a pickle , And every man that 's fatherly , and every kindly matron , In choosing saints would all agree to call St. Nicholas patron .</p>
    <p n="64">He comes again at Christmas-time and stirs us up to giving ; He rings the merry bells that chime good-will to all the living ; He blesses every friendly deed and every free donation ; He sows the secret , golden seed of love through all creation .</p>
    <p n="65">Our fathers drank to Santa Claus , the sixth of each December , And still we keep his feast because his virtues we remember . Among the saintly ranks he stood , with smiling human features , And said , “ Be good ! But not too good to love your fellow-creatures ! ”</p>
    <p n="66">December 6 , 1907 .</p>
    <p n="67">ARS AGRICOLARIS</p>
    <p n="68">An Ode for the “ Farmer 's Dinner , ” University Club , New York , January 23 , 1913</p>
    <p n="69">All hail , ye famous Farmers ! Ye vegetable-charmers , Who know the art of making barren earth Smile with prolific mirth And bring forth twins or triplets at a birth ! Ye scientific fertilizers of the soil , And horny-handed sons of toil ! To-night from all your arduous cares released , With manly brows no longer sweat-impearled , Ye hold your annual feast , And like the Concord farmers long ago , Ye meet above the “ Bridge ” below , And draw the cork heard round the world !</p>
    <p n="70">What memories are yours ! What tales Of triumph have your tongues rehearsed , Telling how ye have won your first Potatoes from the stubborn mead , ( Almost as many as ye sowed for seed ! ) And how the luscious cabbages and kails Have bloomed before you in their bed At seven dollars a head ! And how your onions took a prize For bringing tears into the eyes Of a hard-hearted cook ! And how ye slew The Dragon Cut-worm at a stroke ! And how ye broke , Routed , and put to flight the horrid crew Of vile potato-bugs and Hessian flies ! And how ye did not quail Before th ’ invading armies of San José Scale , But met them bravely with your little pail Of poison , which ye put upon each tail O ’ the dreadful beasts and made their courage fail ! And how ye did acquit yourselves like men In fields of agricultural strife , and then , Like generous warriors , sat you down at ease And gently to your gardener said , “ Let us have Pease ! ”</p>
    <p n="71">But were there Pease ? Ah , no , dear Farmers , no ! The course of Nature is not ordered so . For when we want a vegetable most , She holds it back ; And when we boast To our week-endly friends Of what we 'll give them on our farm , alack , Those things the old dam , Nature , never sends .</p>
    <p n="72">O Pease in bottles , Sparrow-grass in jars , How often have ye saved from scars Of shame , and deep embarrassment , The disingenuous farmer-gent , To whom some wondering guest has cried , “ How do you raise such Pease and Sparrow-grass ? ” Whereat the farmer-gent has not denied The compliment , but smiling has replied , “ To raise such things you must have lots of glass . ”</p>
    <p n="73">From wiles like these , true Farmers , hold aloof ; Accept no praise unless you have the proof . If niggard Nature should withhold the green And sugary Pea , welcome the humble Bean . Even the easy Radish , and the Beet , If grown by your own toil are extra sweet . Let malefactors of great wealth and banker-felons Rejoice in foreign artichokes , imported melons ; But you , my Farmers , at your frugal board Spread forth the fare your Sabine Farms afford . Say to Mæcenas , when he is your guest , “ No peaches ! try this turnip , ‘ tis my best . ” Thus shall ye learn from labors in the field What honesty a farmer 's life may yield , And like G. Washington in early youth , Though cherries fail , produce a crop of truth .</p>
    <p n="74">But think me not too strict , O followers of the plough ; Some place for fiction in your lives I would allow . In January when the world is drear , And bills come in , and no results appear , And snow-storms veil the skies , And ice the streamlet clogs , Then may you warm your heart with pleasant lies And revel in the seedsmen 's catalogues ! What visions and what dreams are these Of cauliflower obese ,— Of giant celery , taller than a mast ,— Of strawberries Like red pincushions , round and vast ,— Of succulent and spicy gumbo ,— Of cantaloupes , as big as Jumbo ,— Of high-strung beans without the strings ,— And of a host of other wild , romantic things !</p>
    <p n="75">Why , then , should Doctor Starr declare That modern habits mental force impair ? And why should H. Marquand complain That jokes as good as his will never come again ? And why should Bridges wear a gloomy mien About the lack of fiction for his Magazine ? The seedsman 's catalogue is all we need To stir our dull imaginations To new creations , And lead us , by the hand Of Hope , into a fairy-land .</p>
    <p n="76">So dream , my friendly Farmers , as you will ; And let your fancy all your garners fill With wondrous crops ; but always recollect That Nature gives us less than we expect . Scorn not the city where you earn the wealth That , spent upon your farms , renews your health ; And tell your wife , whene'er the bills have shocked her , “ A country-place is cheaper than a doctor . ” May roses bloom for you , and may you find Your richest harvest in a tranquil mind .</p>
