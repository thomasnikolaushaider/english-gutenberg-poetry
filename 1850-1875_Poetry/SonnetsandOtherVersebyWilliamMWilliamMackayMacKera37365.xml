    <docTitle><titlePart>SONNETS AND OTHER VERSE . THE OLD AND THE NEW . Scorn not the Old ; ‘ twas sacred in its day , A truth overpowering error with its might , A light dispelling darkness with its ray , A victory won , an intermediate height , Which seers untrammel 'd by their creeds of yore , Heroes and saints , triumphantly attained With hard assail and tribulation sore , That we might use the vantage-ground they gain 'd . Scorn not the Old ; but hail and seize the New With thrill 'd intelligences , hearts that burn , And such truth-seeking spirits that it , too , May soon be superseded in its turn , And men may ever , as the ages roll , March onward toward the still receding goal .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">How many a man of those I see around</l>
       <l n="3">Has cherished fair ideals in his youth ,</l>
       <l n="4">And heard the spirit 's call , and stood spellbound</l>
       <l n="5">Before the shrine of Beauty or of Truth ,</l>
       <l n="6">And lived to see his fair ideals fade ,</l>
       <l n="7">And feel a numbness creep upon his soul ,</l>
       <l n="8">And sadly know himself no longer swayed</l>
       <l n="9">By rigorous Truth or Beauty 's sweet control !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">For some , alas ! life 's thread is almost spun ;</l>
       <l n="11">Few , few and poor , the fibres that remain ;</l>
       <l n="12">But yet , while life lasts , something may be done</l>
       <l n="13">To make the heavenly vision not in vain ;</l>
       <l n="14">Yet , even yet , some triumph may be won ,</l>
       <l n="15">Yea , loss itself be turned to precious gain .</l>

      <head>THE SADDEST THOUGHT .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Sad is the wane of beauty to the fair ,</l>
       <l n="2">Sad is the flux of fortune to the proud ,</l>
       <l n="3">Sad is the look dejected lovers wear ,</l>
       <l n="4">And sad is worth beneath detraction 's cloud .</l>
       <l n="5">Sad is our youth 's inexorable end ,</l>
       <l n="6">Sad is the bankruptcy of fancy 's wealth ,</l>
       <l n="7">Sad is the last departure of a friend ,</l>
       <l n="8">And sadder than most things is loss of health .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">And yet more sad than these to think upon</l>
       <l n="10">Is this — the saddest thought beneath the sun —</l>
       <l n="11">Life , flowing like a river , almost gone</l>
       <l n="12">Into eternity , and nothing done .</l>
       <l n="13">Let me be spared that bootless last regret :</l>

      <head>THE HOUSE-HUNTER .</head>

       <l n="3">Wanting in every homelike requisite ,</l>
       <l n="4">Devoid of beauty , barren of delight ,</l>
       <l n="5">Goes forth from door to door and street to street ,</l>

       <l n="7">A new abode for his convenience meet ,</l>
       <l n="8">Spacious , commodious , fair , and to his mind ;</l>

       <l n="9">So living souls recurrently outgrow</l>

       <l n="11">Too sordid , and their aims too cramped and low .</l>
       <l n="12">And they keep moving onward year by year ,</l>

       <l n="1">It was back in Renfrew County , near the Opeongo line ,</l>
       <l n="2">Where the land 's all hills and hollows and the hills are clothed</l>
       <l n="3">with pine ,</l>
       <l n="4">And in the wooded valleys little lakes shine here and there</l>
       <l n="5">Like jewels in the masses of a lovely woman 's hair ;</l>
       <l n="6">Where the York branch , by a channel ripped through rugged rocks</l>
       <l n="7">and sand ,</l>
       <l n="8">Sweeps to join the Madawaska , speeding downward to the Grand ;</l>
       <l n="9">Where the landscape glows with beauty , like a halo shed abroad ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the face of nature mirrors back the unseen face of God .</l>

       <l n="14">To the pioneer backwoodsman 's tales far on into the night ;</l>

       <l n="16">Not stopping but to stir the fire , which kept the stove red-hot ;</l>
