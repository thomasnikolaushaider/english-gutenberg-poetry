     <l n="17">His life-long ardour . For my theme is just :</l>
     <l n="18">A heart enslaved , a smile , a broken trust ,</l>

     <l n="51">I sought thy side . I gave thee of my store</l>

     <l n="54">The glow thereof , the pressure and the seal ,</l>

     <l n="70">My love-lorn homage when the voice of Fate</l>
     <l n="71">Fell from thy lips , and made me twice a man</l>
     <l n="72">Because half thine , in that betrothal-plan</l>

     <l n="80">In Keats 's Grove . We linger 'd near the stem</l>
     <l n="81">Of that lone tree on which was seen the gem</l>
     <l n="82">Of his bright name , there carven by himself ;</l>

   <p>Since the publication of Faulkner 's work in 1820 , no history of Kensington pretending to accuracy or completeness has been produced . This work contains full and descriptive accounts of the parish of Kensington and the adjoining Palace and Gardens , with the changes and improvements of the past half century or more ; notices of Kensington celebrities and of the great national institutions which have sprung up at Kensington Gore and Brompton Park ; and a fund of discursive matter of local and historical interest . The engravings include artistic exteriors and interiors ; glimpses of Kensington Gardens ; the Palace in which the Queen was born ; the park ; the people , streets , houses , churches , and ruins ; and pretty , quaint , and taking “ bits ” of Kensington scenery . All the drawings have been engraved in Paris in the finest possible manner , and the paper on which they are printed has been specially manufactured of a quality to ensure the delicacy of the originals being fully retained .</p>
   <p>For the curious a few PROOF copies of KENSINGTON : PICTURESQUE AND HISTORICAL at five guineas , bound in full morocco , have painted in water-colours on the front , under the gilt edges of the leaves , a couple of Kensington views , which until the leaves are bent back at an angle , are invisible .</p>
