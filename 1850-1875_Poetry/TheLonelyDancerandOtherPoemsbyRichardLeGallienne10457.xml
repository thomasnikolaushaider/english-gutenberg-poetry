    <docDate><date>1913</date>WITH A FRONTISPIECE PORTRAIT BY IRMA LE GALLIENNE TO IRMA ALL THE WAY Not all my treasure hath the bandit Time Locked in his glimmering caverns of the Past : Fair women dead and friendships of old rhyme , And noble dreams that had to end at last :— Ah ! these indeed ; and from youth 's sacristy Full many a holy relic hath he torn , Vessels of mystic faith God filled for me , Holding them up to Him in life 's young morn . All these are mine no more — Time hath them all , Time and his adamantine gaoler Death : Despoilure vast — yet seemeth it but small , When unto thee I turn , thy bloom and breath Filling with light and incense the last shrine , Innermost , inaccessible ,— yea , thine .</docDate>

     <l n="1">I had no heart to join the dance ,</l>
     <l n="2">I danced it all so long ago —</l>
     <l n="3">Ah ! light-winged music out of France ,</l>
     <l n="4">Let other feet glide to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="5">Weaving new patterns of romance</l>
     <l n="6">For bosoms of new-fallen snow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">But leave me thus where I may hear</l>
     <l n="8">The leafy rustle of the waltz ,</l>
     <l n="9">The shell-like murmur in my ear ,</l>
     <l n="10">The silken whisper fairy-false</l>
     <l n="11">Of unseen rainbows circling near ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the glad shuddering of the walls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Another dance the dancers spin ,</l>
     <l n="14">A shadow-dance of mystic pain ,</l>
     <l n="15">And other partners enter in</l>
     <l n="16">And dance within my lonely brain —</l>
     <l n="17">The swaying woodland shod in green ,</l>
     <l n="18">The ghostly dancers of the rain ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">The lonely dancers of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="20">Foam-footed on the sandy bar ,</l>
     <l n="21">The wizard dance of wind and tree ,</l>
     <l n="22">The eddying dance of stream and star ;</l>
     <l n="23">Yea , all these dancers tread for me</l>
     <l n="24">A measure mournful and bizarre :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">An echo-dance where ear is eye ,</l>
     <l n="26">And sound evokes the shapes of things ,</l>
     <l n="27">Where out of silence and a sigh</l>
     <l n="28">The sad world like a picture springs ,</l>
     <l n="29">As , when some secret bird sweeps by ,</l>
     <l n="30">We see it in the sound of wings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Those human feet upon the floor ,</l>
     <l n="32">That eager pulse of rhythmic breath ,—</l>
     <l n="33">How sadly to an unknown shore</l>
     <l n="34">Each silver footfall hurryeth ;</l>
     <l n="35">A dance of autumn leaves , no more ,</l>
     <l n="36">On the fantastic wind of death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Fire clasped to elemental fire ,</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Tis thus the solar atom whirls ;</l>
     <l n="39">The butterfly in aery gyre ,</l>
     <l n="40">On autumn mornings , swarms and swirls ,</l>
     <l n="41">In dance of delicate desire ,</l>
     <l n="42">No other than these boys and girls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">The same strange music everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="44">The woven paces just the same ,</l>
     <l n="45">Dancing from out the viewless air</l>
     <l n="46">Into the void from whence they came ;</l>
     <l n="47">Ah ! but they make a gallant flare</l>
     <l n="48">Against the dark , each little flame !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">And what if all the meaning lies</l>
     <l n="50">Just in the music , not in those</l>
     <l n="51">Who dance thus with transfigured eyes ,</l>
     <l n="52">Holding in vain each other close ;</l>
     <l n="53">Only the music never dies ,</l>
     <l n="54">The dance goes on ,— the dancer goes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">A woman dancing , or a world</l>
     <l n="56">Poised on one crystal foot afar ,</l>
     <l n="57">In shining gulfs of silence whirled ,</l>
     <l n="58">Like notes of the strange music are ;</l>
     <l n="59">Small shape against another curled ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or dancing dust that makes a star .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">To him who plays the violin</l>
     <l n="62">All one it is who joins the reel ,</l>
     <l n="63">Drops from the dance , or enters in ;</l>
     <l n="64">So that the never-ending wheel</l>
     <l n="65">Cease not its mystic course to spin ,</l>
     <l n="66">For weal or woe , for woe or weal .</l>

     <l n="16">Rainbow and shell and butterfly ,</l>

     <l n="22">To shape that little thing your ear :</l>

    <head>A FACE IN A BOOK</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In an old book I found her face</l>
     <l n="2">Writ by a dead man long ago —</l>
     <l n="3">I found , and then I lost the place ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Even if she lived I cannot learn ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or but a dead man 's dream she were ;</l>
     <l n="8">Page after yellow page I turn ,</l>
     <l n="9">But cannot come again to her ,</l>
     <l n="10">Although I know she must be there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">On other books of other men ,</l>
     <l n="12">Far in the night , year-long , I pore ,</l>
     <l n="13">Hoping to find her face again ,</l>
     <l n="14">Too fair a face to see no more —</l>
     <l n="15">And ‘ twas so soft a name she bore .</l>

     <l n="16">Sometimes I think the book was Youth ,</l>
     <l n="17">And the dead man that wrote it I ,</l>
     <l n="18">The face was Beauty , the name Truth —</l>

     <l n="20">I pass the long-sought image by .</l>

     <l n="10">And with her rising came a thought to me —</l>
     <l n="11">How ever old and ever young she grows ,</l>
     <l n="12">And still more lovely she .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Thereat I smiled , thinking on lovely things</l>

     <l n="15">Whereof the song immortal tireless sings ,</l>
     <l n="16">And Time but touches to make lovelier ;</l>
     <l n="17">On Beauty sempiternal as the Spring 's —</l>
     <l n="18">So old are all things fair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Then for that face I cast aside my fears ,</l>
     <l n="20">For changing Time is Beauty 's changeless friend ,</l>
     <l n="21">That never reaches but for ever nears ,</l>
     <l n="22">Tireless the old perfections to transcend ,</l>
     <l n="23">Fairness more fair to fashion with the years ,</l>
     <l n="24">And loveliest to end .</l>

     <l n="42">Faith so firm no doubt can move it —</l>
     <l n="43">Then the bees will leave the honey</l>

   <p>THE END</p>
  </body>
  <back>
   <note>Tell me , strange heart , so mysteriously beating — Unto what end ? Body and soul so mysteriously meeting , Strange friend and friend ; Hand clasped in hand so mysteriously faring , Say what and why all this dreaming and daring , This sowing and reaping and laughing and weeping , That ends but in sleeping — Only one meaning , only — the End . Ah ! all the love , the gold glory , the singing ,— Unto what end ? Flowers of April immortally springing , Face of one 's friend , Stars of the morning and moon in her quarters , Shining of suns and running of waters , Growing and blowing and snowing and flowing ,— Ah ! where are they going ? All on one journey , all to — the End .</note>
