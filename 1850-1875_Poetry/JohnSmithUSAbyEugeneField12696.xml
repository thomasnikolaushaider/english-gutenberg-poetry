    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">From whatever point of view the character of Eugene Field is seen , genius — rare and quaint presents itself is childlike simplicity . That he was a poet of keen perception , of rare discrimination , all will admit . He was a humorist as delicate and fanciful as Artemus Ward , Mark Twain , Bill Nye , James Whitcomb Riley , Opie Read , or Bret Harte in their happiest moods . Within him ran a poetic vein , capable of being worked in any direction , and from which he could , at will , extract that which his imagination saw and felt most . That he occasionally left the child-world , in which he longed to linger , to wander among the older children of men , where intuitively the hungry listener follows him into his Temple of Mirth , all should rejoice , for those who knew him not , can while away the moments imbibing the genius of his imagination in the poetry and prose here presented .</p>
    <p n="2">Though never possessing an intimate acquaintanceship with Field , owing largely to the disparity in our ages , still there existed a bond of friendliness that renders my good opinion of him in a measure trustworthy . Born in the same city , both students in the same college , engaged at various times in newspaper work both in St. Louis and Chicago , residents of the same ward , with many mutual friends , it is not surprising that I am able to say of him that “ the world is better off that he lived , not in gold and silver or precious jewels , but in the bestowal of priceless truths , of which the possessor of this book becomes a benefactor of no mean share of his estate . ”</p>
    <p n="3">Every lover of Field , whether of the songs of childhood or the poems that lend mirth to the out-pouring of his poetic nature , will welcome this unique collection of his choicest wit and humor .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">To-day I strayed in Charing Cross as wretched as could be</l>
     <l n="3">With thinking of my home and friends across the tumbling sea ;</l>
     <l n="4">There was no water in my eyes , but my spirits were depressed</l>
     <l n="5">And my heart lay like a sodden , soggy doughnut in my breast .</l>
     <l n="6">This way and that streamed multitudes , that gayly passed me by —</l>
     <l n="7">Not one in all the crowd knew me and not a one knew I !</l>
     <l n="8">“ Oh , for a touch of home ! ” I sighed ; “ oh , for a friendly face !</l>
     <l n="9">Oh , for a hearty handclasp in this teeming desert place ! ”</l>
     <l n="10">And so , soliloquizing as a homesick creature will ,</l>
     <l n="11">Incontinent , I wandered down the noisy , bustling hill</l>
     <l n="12">And drifted , automatic-like and vaguely , into Lowe 's ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where Fortune had in store a panacea for my woes .</l>
     <l n="14">The register was open , and there dawned upon my sight</l>
     <l n="15">A name that filled and thrilled me with a cyclone of delight —</l>
     <l n="16">The name that I shall venerate unto my dying day —</l>
     <l n="17">The proud , immortal signature : “ John Smith , U. S. A . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">Wildly I clutched the register and brooded on that name —</l>
     <l n="19">I knew John Smith , yet could not well identify the same .</l>
     <l n="20">I knew him North , I knew him South , I knew him East and West —</l>
     <l n="21">I knew him all so well I knew not which I knew the best .</l>
     <l n="22">His eyes , I recollect , were gray , and black , and brown , and blue ,</l>
     <l n="23">And , when he was not bald , his hair was of chameleon hue ;</l>
     <l n="24">Lean , fat , tall , short , rich , poor , grave , gay , a blonde and a brunette —</l>
     <l n="25">Aha , amid this London fog , John Smith , I see you yet ;</l>
     <l n="26">I see you yet , and yet the sight is all so blurred I seem</l>
     <l n="27">To see you in composite , or as in a waking dream ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which are you , John ? I 'd like to know , that I might weave a rhyme</l>
     <l n="29">Appropriate to your character , your politics and clime ;</l>
     <l n="30">So tell me , were you “ raised ” or “ reared ” — your pedigree confess</l>
     <l n="31">In some such treacherous ism as “ I reckon ” or “ I guess ” ;</l>
     <l n="32">Let fall your tell-tale dialect , that instantly I may</l>
     <l n="33">Identify my countryman , “ John Smith , U. S. A . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">It 's like as not you are the John that lived a spell ago</l>
     <l n="35">Down East , where codfish , beans ‘ nd bona-fide school-marms grow ;</l>
     <l n="36">Where the dear old homestead nestles like among the Hampshire hills</l>
     <l n="37">And where the robin hops about the cherry boughs and trills ;</l>
     <l n="38">Where Hubbard squash ‘ nd huckleberries grow to powerful size ,</l>
     <l n="39">And everything is orthodox from preachers down to pies ;</l>
     <l n="40">Where the red-wing blackbirds swing ‘ nd call beside the pickril pond ,</l>
     <l n="41">And the crows air cawin ’ in the pines uv the pasture lot beyond ;</l>
     <l n="42">Where folks complain uv bein ’ poor , because their money 's lent</l>
     <l n="43">Out West on farms ‘ nd railroads at the rate uv ten per cent ;</l>
     <l n="44">Where we ust to spark the Baker girls a-comin ’ home from choir ,</l>
     <l n="45">Or a-settin ’ namin ’ apples round the roarin ’ kitchen fire :</l>
     <l n="46">Where we had to go to meetin ’ at least three times a week ,</l>
     <l n="47">And our mothers learnt us good religious Dr. Watts to speak ,</l>
     <l n="48">And where our grandmas sleep their sleep — God rest their souls , I say !</l>
     <l n="49">And God bless yours , ef you 're that John , “ John Smith , U. S. A . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="50">Or , mebbe , Colonel Smith , yo ’ are the gentleman I know</l>
     <l n="51">In the country whar the finest democrats ‘ nd horses grow ;</l>
     <l n="52">Whar the ladies are all beautiful an ’ whar the crap of cawn</l>
     <l n="53">Is utilized for Bourbon and true dawters are bawn ;</l>
     <l n="54">You 've ren for jedge , and killed yore man , and bet on Proctor Knott —</l>
     <l n="55">Yore heart is full of chivalry , yore skin is full of shot ;</l>
     <l n="56">And I disremember whar I 've met with gentlemen so true</l>
     <l n="57">As yo ’ all in Kaintucky , whar blood an ’ grass are blue ;</l>
     <l n="58">Whar a niggah with a ballot is the signal fo ’ a fight ,</l>
     <l n="59">Whar a yaller dawg pursues the coon throughout the bammy night ;</l>
     <l n="60">Whar blooms the furtive ‘ possum — pride an ’ glory of the South —</l>
     <l n="61">And Aunty makes a hoe-cake , sah , that melts within yo ’ mouth !</l>
     <l n="62">Whar , all night long , the mockin ’ - birds are warblin ’ in the trees</l>
     <l n="63">And black-eyed Susans nod and blink at every passing breeze ,</l>
     <l n="64">Whar in a hallowed soil repose the ashes of our Clay —</l>
     <l n="65">Hyar 's lookin ’ at yo ’ , Colonel “ John Smith , U. S. A . ” !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="66">Or wuz you that John Smith I knew out yonder in the West —</l>
     <l n="67">That part of our republic I shall always love the best ?</l>
     <l n="68">Wuz you him that went prospectin ’ in the spring of sixty-nine</l>
     <l n="69">In the Red Hoss mountain country for the Gosh-All-Hemlock Mine ?</l>
     <l n="70">Oh , how I 'd like to clasp your hand an ’ set down by your side</l>
     <l n="71">And talk about the good old days beyond the big divide ;</l>
     <l n="72">Of the rackaboar , the snaix , the bear , the Rocky Mountain goat ,</l>
     <l n="73">Of the conversazzhyony ‘ nd of Casey 's tabble-dote ,</l>
     <l n="74">And a word of them old pardners that stood by us long ago</l>
     <l n="75">( Three-Fingered Hoover , Sorry Tom and Parson Jim , you know ) !</l>
     <l n="76">Old times , old friends , John Smith , would make our hearts beat high</l>
     <l n="77">again ,</l>
     <l n="78">And we 'd see the snow-top mountain like we used to see ‘ em then ;</l>
     <l n="79">The magpies would go flutterin ’ like strange sperrits to ‘ nd fro ,</l>
     <l n="80">And we 'd hear the pines a-singing ’ in the ragged gulch below ;</l>
     <l n="81">And the mountain brook would loiter like upon its windin ’ way ,</l>
     <l n="82">Ez if it waited for a child to jine it in its play .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="83">You see , John Smith , just which you are I cannot well recall ,</l>
     <l n="84">And , really , I am pleased to think you somehow must be all !</l>
     <l n="85">For when a man sojourns abroad awhile ( as I have done )</l>
     <l n="86">He likes to think of all the folks he left at home as one —</l>
     <l n="87">And so they are ! For well you know there 's nothing in a name — -</l>
     <l n="88">Our Browns , our Joneses and our Smiths are happily the same ;</l>
     <l n="89">All represent the spirit of the land across the sea ,</l>
     <l n="90">All stand for one high purpose in our country of the free !</l>
     <l n="91">Whether John Smith be from the South , the North , the West , the East —</l>
     <l n="92">So long as he 's American , it mattereth not the least ;</l>
     <l n="93">Whether his crest be badger , bear , palmetto , sword or pine ,</l>
     <l n="94">He is the glory of the stars that with the stripes combine !</l>
     <l n="95">Where'er he be , whate'er his lot , he 's eager to be known ,</l>
     <l n="96">Not by his mortal name , but by his country 's name alone !</l>
     <l n="97">And so , compatriot , I am proud you wrote your name to-day</l>
     <l n="98">Upon the register at Lowe 's , “ John Smith , U. S. A . ”</l>

     <l n="1">Of all the gracious gifts of Spring ,</l>
     <l n="2">Is there another can safely surpass</l>
     <l n="3">This delicate , voluptuous thing —</l>
     <l n="4">This dapple-green , plump-shouldered bass ?</l>
     <l n="5">Upon a damask napkin laid ,</l>
     <l n="6">What exhalations superfine</l>

     <l n="9">The ancients loved this noble fish ,</l>

     <l n="13">“ Fish should swim twice , ” they used to say —</l>
     <l n="14">Once in their native vapid brine ,</l>

     <l n="20">Where weeds and pussy willows grew !</l>
     <l n="21">How often have you filched my bait !</l>
     <l n="22">How often have you snapped my treacherous line !—</l>
     <l n="23">Yet here I have you on this plate .</l>
     <l n="24">You shall swim twice , and now in wine !</l>

     <l n="27">Aye , in a rich Burgundy flood</l>
     <l n="28">This piscatorial pride should swim ;</l>
     <l n="29">So , were he living , he should say</l>
     <l n="30">He gladly died for me and mine ,</l>
     <l n="31">And , as it was his native spray ,</l>
     <l n="32">He 'd lash the sauce — What , ho ! the wine !</l>

    <head>THE MAN WHO WORKED WITH DANA ON THE “ SUN ” .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thar showed up out ‘ n Denver in the spring of ‘ 81</l>
     <l n="2">A man who 'd worked with Dana on the Noo York Sun .</l>
     <l n="3">His name was Cantell Whoppers , ‘ nd he was a sight ter view</l>
     <l n="4">Ez he walked into the orfice ‘ nd inquired for work to do ;</l>
     <l n="5">Thar war n't no places vacant then — fer , be it understood ,</l>
     <l n="6">That was the time when talent flourished at that altitood ;</l>
     <l n="7">But thar the stranger lingered , tellin ’ Raymond ‘ nd the rest</l>
     <l n="8">Uv what perdigious wonders he could do when at his best —</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Til finally he stated ( quite by chance ) that he had done</l>
     <l n="10">A heap uv work with Dana on the Noo York Sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Wall , that wuz quite another thing ; we owned that ary cuss</l>
     <l n="12">Who 'd worked f'r Mr. Dana must be good enough for us !</l>
     <l n="13">And so we tuk the stranger 's word ‘ nd nipped him while we could ,</l>
     <l n="14">For if we did n't take him we knew John Arkins would —</l>
     <l n="15">And Cooper , too , wuz mousin ’ round for enterprise ‘ nd brains ,</l>
     <l n="16">Whenever them commodities blew in across the plains .</l>
     <l n="17">At any rate , we nailed him — which made ol ’ Cooper swear</l>
     <l n="18">And Arkins tear out handfuls uv his copious curly hair —</l>
     <l n="19">But we set back and cackled , ‘ nd had a power uv fun</l>
     <l n="20">With our man who 'd worked with Dana on the Noo York Sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">It made our eyes hang on our cheeks ‘ nd lower jaws ter drop</l>
     <l n="22">Ter hear that feller tellin ’ how ol ’ Dana run his shop ;</l>
     <l n="23">It seems that Dana was the biggest man you ever saw —</l>
     <l n="24">He lived on human bein 's ‘ nd preferred to eat ‘ em raw !</l>
     <l n="25">If he had democratic drugs to take , before he took ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="26">As good old allopathic laws prescribe , he allus shook ‘ em !</l>
     <l n="27">The man that could set down ‘ nd write like Dana never grew</l>
     <l n="28">And the sum of human knowledge wuz n't half what Dana knew .</l>
     <l n="29">The consequence appeared to be that nearly everyone</l>
     <l n="30">Concurred with Mr. Dana of the Noo York Sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">This feller , Cantell Whoppers , never brought an item in —</l>
     <l n="32">He spent his time at Perrin 's shakin ’ poker dice f'r gin ;</l>
     <l n="33">Whatever the assignment , he wuz allus sure to shirk —</l>
     <l n="34">He wuz very long on likker and all-fired short on work !</l>
     <l n="35">If any other cuss had played the tricks he dare ter play ,</l>
     <l n="36">The daisies would be bloomin ’ over his remains to-day ;</l>
     <l n="37">But , somehow , folks respected him and stood him to the last ,</l>
     <l n="38">Considerin ’ his superior connections in the past ;</l>
     <l n="39">So , when he bilked at poker , not a sucker drew a gun</l>
     <l n="40">On the man who 'd worked with Dana on the Noo York Sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">Wall , Dana came ter Denver in the fall uv ‘ 83 —</l>
     <l n="42">A very different party from the man we thought ter see !</l>
     <l n="43">A nice ‘ nd clean old gentleman , so dignerfied ‘ nd calm —</l>
     <l n="44">You bet yer life he never did no human bein ’ harm !</l>
     <l n="45">A certain hearty manner ‘ nd a fullness uv the vest</l>
     <l n="46">Betokened that his sperrits ‘ nd his victuals wuz the best ;</l>
     <l n="47">His face was so benevolent , his smile so sweet ‘ nd kind ,</l>
     <l n="48">That they seemed to be the reflex uv an honest , healthy mind ,</l>
     <l n="49">And God had set upon his head a crown uv silver hair</l>
     <l n="50">In promise of the golden crown He meaneth him to wear ;</l>
     <l n="51">So , uv us boys that met him out ‘ n Denver there wuz none</l>

     <l n="53">But when he came to Denver in that fall uv ‘ 83</l>
     <l n="54">His old friend , Cantell Whoppers , disappeared upon a spree ;</l>

     <l n="56">( They had n't been together fer a year or two , you know )</l>
     <l n="57">That he borrowed all the stuff he could and started on a bat ,</l>
     <l n="58">And , strange as it may seem , we did n't see him after that .</l>
     <l n="59">So when ol ’ Dana hove in sight we could n't understand</l>
     <l n="60">Why he did n't seem to notice that his crony wa'n ' t on hand ;</l>
     <l n="61">No casual allusion — not a question , no , not one —</l>
     <l n="62">For the man who 'd “ worked with Dana on the Noo York Sun ” !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="63">We broke it gently to him , but he did n't seem surprised —</l>
     <l n="64">Thar wuz no big burst uv passion as we fellers had surmised ;</l>
     <l n="65">He said that Whoppers wuz a man he did n't never heerd about ,</l>
     <l n="66">But he might have carried papers on a Jersey City route —</l>
     <l n="67">And then he recollected hearin ’ Mr. Laflin say</l>

     <l n="69">Which , with more likker underneath than money in his vest ,</l>
     <l n="70">Had started on a freight train fur the great ‘ nd boundin ’ West —</l>
     <l n="71">But further information or statistics he had none</l>
     <l n="72">Uv the man who 'd “ worked with Dana on the Noo York Sun . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="73">We dropped the matter quietly ‘ nd never made no fuss —</l>
     <l n="74">When we get played fer suckers — why , that 's a horse on us !</l>
     <l n="75">But every now ‘ nd then we Denver fellers have to laff</l>
     <l n="76">To hear some other paper boast uv havin ’ on its staff</l>

     <l n="78">And pull our hats down on our eyes ‘ nd set around ‘ nd think .</l>
     <l n="79">It seems like Dana could n't be as smart as people say</l>
     <l n="80">If he educates so many folks ‘ nd lets ‘ em get away ;</l>
     <l n="81">And , as for us , in future we 'll be very apt to shun</l>

    <head>THE PETER-BIRD .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Out of the woods by the creek cometh a calling for Peter ,</l>
     <l n="2">From the orchard a voice echoes and echoes it over ;</l>
     <l n="3">Down in the pasture the sheep hear that strange crying for Peter ,</l>
     <l n="4">Over the meadows that call is aye and forever repeated .</l>
     <l n="5">So let me tell you the tale , when , where and how it all happened ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , when the story is told , let us pay heed to the lesson .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Once on a time , long ago , lived in the state of Kentucky</l>
     <l n="8">One that was reckoned a witch — full of strange spells and devices ;</l>
     <l n="9">Nightly she wandered the woods , searching for charms voodooistic —</l>
     <l n="10">Scorpions , lizards , and herbs , dormice , chameleons and plantains !</l>
     <l n="11">Serpents and caw-caws and bats , screech-owls and crickets and adders —</l>
     <l n="12">These were the guides of the witch through the dank deeps of the forest .</l>
     <l n="13">Then , with her roots and her herbs , back to her cave in the morning</l>
     <l n="14">Ambled that hussy to brew spells of unspeakable evil ;</l>
     <l n="15">And , when the people awoke , seeing the hillside and valley</l>
     <l n="16">Sweltered in swathes as of mist — “ Look ! ” they would whisper in terror —</l>
     <l n="17">“ Look ! the old witch is at work brewing her spells of great evil ! ”</l>
     <l n="18">Then would they pray till the sun , darting his rays through the vapor ,</l>
     <l n="19">Lifted the smoke from the earth and baffled the witch 's intentions .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="20">One of the boys at that time was a certain young person named Peter ,</l>
     <l n="21">Given too little to work , given too largely to dreaming ;</l>
     <l n="22">Fonder of books than of chores you can imagine that Peter</l>
     <l n="23">Led a sad life on the farm , causing his parents much trouble .</l>
     <l n="24">“ Peter ! ” his mother would call , “ the cream is a-ready for churning ! ”</l>
     <l n="25">“ Peter ! ” his father would cry , “ go grub at the weeds in the garden ! ”</l>
     <l n="26">So it was “ Peter ! ” all day — calling , reminding and chiding —</l>
     <l n="27">Peter neglected his work ; therefore that nagging at Peter !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">Peter got hold of some books — how I 'm unable to tell you ;</l>
     <l n="29">Some have suspected the witch — this is no place for suspicions !</l>
     <l n="30">It is sufficient to stick close to the thread of the legend .</l>
     <l n="31">Nor is it stated or guessed what was the trend of those volumes ;</l>
     <l n="32">What thing soever it was — done with a pen and a pencil ,</l>
     <l n="33">Wrought with the brain , not a hoe — surely ‘ twas hostile to farming !</l>
     <l n="34">“ Fudge on the readin ’ ! ” they quoth ; “ that 's what 's the ruin of Peter ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">So , when the mornings were hot , under the beech or the maple ,</l>
     <l n="36">Cushioned in grass that was blue , breathing the breath of the blossoms .</l>
     <l n="37">Lulled by the hum of the bees , the coo of the ringdoves a-mating ,</l>
     <l n="38">Peter would frivol his time at reading , or lazing , or dreaming .</l>
     <l n="39">“ Peter ! ” his mother would call , “ the cream is a-ready for churning ! ”</l>
     <l n="40">“ Peter ! ” his father would cry , “ go grub at the weeds in the garden ! ”</l>
     <l n="41">“ Peter ! ” and “ Peter ! ” all day — calling , reminding and chiding —</l>
     <l n="42">Peter neglected his chores ; therefore that outcry for Peter ;</l>
     <l n="43">Therefore the neighbors allowed evil would surely befall him —</l>
     <l n="44">Yes , on account of these things , ruin would come upon Peter !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="45">Surely enough , on a time , reading and lazing and dreaming</l>
     <l n="46">Wrought the calamitous ill all had predicted for Peter ;</l>
     <l n="47">For , of a morning in spring when lay the mist in the valleys —</l>
     <l n="48">“ See , ” quoth the folk , “ how the witch breweth her evil decoctions !</l>
     <l n="49">See how the smoke from her fire broodeth on wood land and meadow !</l>
     <l n="50">Grant that the sun cometh out to smother the smudge of her caldron !</l>
     <l n="51">She hath been forth in the night , full of her spells and devices ,</l>
     <l n="52">Roaming the marshes and dells for heathenish musical nostrums ;</l>
     <l n="53">Digging in leaves and at stumps for centipedes , pismires and spiders ,</l>
     <l n="54">Grubbing in poisonous pools for hot salmanders and toadstools ;</l>
     <l n="55">Charming the bats from the flues , snaring the lizards by twilight ,</l>
     <l n="56">Sucking the scorpion 's egg and milking the breast of the adder ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">Peter derided these things held in such faith by the farmer ,</l>
     <l n="58">Scouted at magic and charms , hooted at Jonahs and hoodoos —</l>
     <l n="59">Thinking the reading of books must have unsettled his reason !</l>
     <l n="60">“ There ai n't no witches , ” he cried ; “ it is n't smoky , but foggy !</l>
     <l n="61">I will go out in the wet — you all can n't hender me , nuther ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="62">Surely enough he went out into the damp of the morning ,</l>
     <l n="63">Into the smudge that the witch spread over woodland and meadow ,</l>
     <l n="64">Into the fleecy gray pall brooding on hillside and valley .</l>
     <l n="65">Laughing and scoffing , he strode into that hideous vapor ;</l>
     <l n="66">Just as he said he would do , just as he bantered and threatened ,</l>
     <l n="67">Ere they could fasten the door , Peter had gone and done it !</l>
     <l n="68">Wasting his time over books , you see , had unsettled his reason —</l>
     <l n="69">Soddened his callow young brain with semi-pubescent paresis ,</l>
     <l n="70">And his neglect of his chores hastened this evil condition .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="71">Out of the woods by the creek cometh a calling for Peter</l>
     <l n="72">And from the orchard a voice echoes and echoes it over ;</l>
     <l n="73">Down in the pasture the sheep hear that shrill crying for Peter ,</l>
     <l n="74">Up from the spring-house the wail stealeth anon like a whisper ,</l>
     <l n="75">Over the meadows that call is aye and forever repeated .</l>
     <l n="76">Such are the voices that whooped wildly and vainly for Peter</l>
     <l n="77">Decades and decades ago down in the state of Kentucky —</l>
     <l n="78">Such are the voices that cry from the woodland and meadow ,</l>
     <l n="79">“ Peter — O Peter ! ” all day , calling , reminding , and chiding —</l>
     <l n="80">Taking us back to the time when Peter he done gone and done it !</l>
     <l n="81">These are the voices of those left by the boy in the farmhouse</l>
     <l n="82">When , with his laughter and scorn , hatless and bootless and sockless ,</l>
     <l n="83">Clothed in his jeans and his pride , Peter sailed out in the weather ,</l>
     <l n="84">Broke from the warmth of his home into that fog of the devil .</l>
     <l n="85">Into the smoke of that witch brewing her damnable porridge !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="86">Lo , when he vanished from sight , knowing the evil that threatened ,</l>
     <l n="87">Forth with importunate cries hastened his father and mother .</l>
     <l n="88">“ Peter ! ” they shrieked in alarm , “ Peter ! ” and evermore “ Peter ! ” —</l>
     <l n="89">Ran from the house to the barn , ran from the barn to the garden ,</l>
     <l n="90">Ran to the corn-crib anon , then to the smokehouse proceeded ;</l>
     <l n="91">Henhouse and woodpile they passed , calling and wailing and weeping ,</l>
     <l n="92">Through the front gate to the road , braving the hideous vapor —</l>
     <l n="93">Sought him in lane and on pike , called him in orchard and meadow ,</l>
     <l n="94">Clamoring “ Peter ! ” in vain , vainly outcrying for Peter .</l>
     <l n="95">Joining the search came the rest , brothers , and sisters and cousins ,</l>
     <l n="96">Venting unspeakable fears in pitiful wailing for Peter !</l>
     <l n="97">And from the neighboring farms gathered the men and the women .</l>
     <l n="98">Who , upon hearing the news , swelled the loud chorus for Peter .</l>

     <l n="101">All that had voices to voice , all to those parts appertaining .</l>

     <l n="3">And said : “ We 'll set this day apart ,</l>
     <l n="4">So sunny , so wondrous fair . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">His face was full of a happy light ,</l>
     <l n="6">His voice was tender and low and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="7">The daisies and the violets grew at our feet —</l>
     <l n="8">Alas , for the coming of night !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The rose is black and withered and dead !</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Tis hid in a tiny box away ;</l>
     <l n="11">The nut-brown hair is turning to gray ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the light of the day is fled !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The light of the beautiful day is fled ,</l>
     <l n="14">Hush 'd is the voice so sweet and low —</l>
     <l n="15">And I — ah , me ! I loved him so —</l>
     <l n="16">And the daisies grow over his head !</l>
