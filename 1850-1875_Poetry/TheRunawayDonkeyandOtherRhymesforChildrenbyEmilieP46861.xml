    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Several of the rhymed stories in this book are true stories , and children may enjoy them the more for knowing that Barney , a real donkey , did run away and play pranks as the rhymes say ; that Midget did ride horseback ; that the deer did toss the hay to the hungry pony ; and that Queen Victoria did restore the birds ’ nesting-place in the old round tower at Windsor . Pony Rollo , too , is a real character , clever and lovable , although some liberties have been taken in the portrayal of him and his doings . Barney Gray is still living , petted by his now grown-up owners and enjoyed by all children who visit the farm to which the donkey came about twenty years ago , and a drive with Barney is quite as likely now as in former days to have unexpected features .</p>
    <p n="2">The pictures of Barney and some of the other pets have been drawn by Mr. Bridgman from photographs taken expressly for this book .</p>
    <p n="3">In the belief that such rhymes as are herein offered gratify and increase in children both the love of animals and the sense of humor , this new volume is sent forth not only to give pleasure , but to contribute what it may to the fostering of these desirable traits .</p>
    <p n="4">Kindergartners will find here , as in Through the Farmyard Gate , suitable material for kindergarten use ; for example , the cumulative rhyme , The Pigeons , and the tracing-back rhyme , Who Gives us Our Thanksgiving Dinner ?</p>
    <p n="5">For courteous permission to use such of these rhymes as have already appeared in print , acknowledgments are made to publishers and periodicals as follows : The Century Company , New York ( St. Nicholas ) ; S. E. Cassino , Salem , Massachusetts ( Little Folks ) ; and Milton Bradley Co ., Springfield , Massachusetts ( Kindergarten Review ) .</p>

     <l n="95">Well , following was pleasant ,</l>
     <l n="96">So , when they made a start ,</l>
     <l n="97">He scampered after , gay and free ,</l>
     <l n="98">With mischief in his heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="99">Yet when they reached the bottom ,</l>
     <l n="100">So staid he looked and meek ,</l>
     <l n="101">That naught seemed farther from his mind</l>
     <l n="102">Than joke or prank or freak .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="103">“ Oh , this is fun ! ” said Helen ,</l>
     <l n="104">“ I 'll always coast this way ;</l>
     <l n="105">I hate to trudge back up the hill ,</l>
     <l n="106">And drag the sled or sleigh . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="107">“ Yes , that 's the worst of coasting ,</l>
     <l n="108">That tedious uphill climb ;</l>
     <l n="109">But Barney saves us all that tug ,</l>
     <l n="110">Let 's coast a long , long time . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="111">They meant to harness Barney ,</l>
     <l n="112">And start at once uphill ;</l>
     <l n="113">But Barney thought the time had come</l>
     <l n="114">His own plan to fulfil .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="115">So , just before his mistress</l>
     <l n="116">The flying rein could seize ,</l>
     <l n="117">Old Barney gave a sudden leap ,</l>
     <l n="118">Escaping her with ease .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="119">“ Whoa , Barney ! ” shouted Helen ,</l>
     <l n="120">When off he clashed , “ Whoa , whoa ! ”</l>
     <l n="121">And both the girls chased after him</l>
     <l n="122">As fast as they could go .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="123">But Barney sped the faster ,</l>
     <l n="124">With feet as swift and light ,</l>
     <l n="125">As if he had grown young again ;</l>
     <l n="126">Soon he was out of sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="127">And as he scampered homeward ,</l>
     <l n="128">He thought with gleeful mind</l>
     <l n="129">Of how he 'd turned the joke on them ,</l>
     <l n="130">The girls he 'd left behind .</l>
