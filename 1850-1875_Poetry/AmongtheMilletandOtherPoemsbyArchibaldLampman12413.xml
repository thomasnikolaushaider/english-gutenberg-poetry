     <l n="9">They called you sheep , the sky your sward ,</l>

     <l n="17">Where daisies in the meadow toss ,</l>

    <head>APRIL .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Pale season , watcher in unvexed suspense ,</l>
     <l n="2">Still priestess of the patient middle day ,</l>
     <l n="3">Betwixt wild March 's humored petulence</l>
     <l n="4">And the warm wooing of green kirtled May ,</l>
     <l n="5">Maid month of sunny peace and sober grey ,</l>
     <l n="6">Weaver of flowers in sunward glades that ring</l>
     <l n="7">With murmur of libation to the spring :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">As memory of pain , all past , is peace ,</l>
     <l n="9">And joy , dream-tasted , hath the deepest cheer ,</l>
     <l n="10">So art thou sweetest of all months that lease</l>
     <l n="11">The twelve short spaces of the flying year .</l>
     <l n="12">The bloomless days are dead , and frozen fear</l>
     <l n="13">No more for many moons shall vex the earth ,</l>
     <l n="14">Dreaming of summer and fruit laden mirth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">The grey song-sparrows full of spring have sung</l>
     <l n="16">Their clear thin silvery tunes in leafless trees ;</l>
     <l n="17">The robin hops , and whistles , and among</l>
     <l n="18">The silver-tasseled poplars the brown bees</l>
     <l n="19">Murmur faint dreams of summer harvestries ;</l>
     <l n="20">The creamy sun at even scatters down</l>
     <l n="21">A gold-green mist across the murmuring town .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">By the slow streams the frogs all day and night</l>
     <l n="23">Dream without thought of pain or heed of ill ,</l>
     <l n="24">Watching the long warm silent hours take flight ,</l>
     <l n="25">And ever with soft throats that pulse and thrill ,</l>
     <l n="26">From the pale-weeded shallows trill and trill ,</l>
     <l n="27">Tremulous sweet voices , flute-like , answering</l>
     <l n="28">One to another glorying in the spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">All day across the ever-cloven soil ,</l>
     <l n="30">Strong horses labour , steaming in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="31">Down the long furrows with slow straining toil ,</l>
     <l n="32">Turning the brown clean layers ; and one by one</l>
     <l n="33">The crows gloom over them till daylight done</l>
     <l n="34">Finds them asleep somewhere in duskèd lines</l>
     <l n="35">Beyond the wheatlands in the northern pines .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">The old year 's cloaking of brown leaves that bind</l>
     <l n="37">The forest floor-ways , plated close and true —</l>
     <l n="38">The last love 's labour of the autumn wind —</l>
     <l n="39">Is broken with curled flower buds white and blue</l>
     <l n="40">In all the matted hollows , and speared through</l>
     <l n="41">With thousand serpent-spotted blades up-sprung ,</l>
     <l n="42">Yet bloomless , of the slender adder-tongue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">In the warm noon the south wind creeps and cools ,</l>
     <l n="44">Where the red-budded stems of maples throw</l>
     <l n="45">Still tangled etchings on the amber pools ,</l>
     <l n="46">Quite silent now , forgetful of the slow</l>
     <l n="47">Drip of the taps , the troughs , and trampled snow ,</l>
     <l n="48">The keen March mornings , and the silvering rime</l>
     <l n="49">And mirthful labour of the sugar prime .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">Ah , I have wandered with unwearied feet ,</l>
     <l n="51">All the long sweetness of an April day ,</l>
     <l n="52">Lulled with cool murmurs and the drowsy beat</l>
     <l n="53">Of partridge wings in secret thickets grey ,</l>
     <l n="54">The marriage hymns of all the birds at play ,</l>
     <l n="55">The faces of sweet flowers , and easeful dreams</l>
     <l n="56">Beside slow reaches of frog-haunted streams ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">Wandered with happy feet , and quite forgot</l>
     <l n="58">The shallow toil , the strife against the grain ,</l>
     <l n="59">Near souls , that hear us call , but answer not ,</l>
     <l n="60">The loneliness , perplexity and pain ,</l>
     <l n="61">And high thoughts cankered with an earthly stain</l>
     <l n="62">And then the long draught emptied to the lees ,</l>
     <l n="63">I turn me homeward in slow pacing ease ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">Cleaving the cedar shadows and the thin</l>
     <l n="65">Mist of grey gnats that cloud the river shore ,</l>
     <l n="66">Sweet even choruses , that dance and spin</l>
     <l n="67">Soft tangles in the sunset ; and once more</l>
     <l n="68">The city smites me with its dissonant roar .</l>
     <l n="69">To its hot heart I pass , untroubled yet ,</l>
     <l n="70">Fed with calm hope , without desire or fret .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="71">So to the year 's first altar step I bring</l>
     <l n="72">Gifts of meek song , and make my spirit free</l>
     <l n="73">With the blind working of unanxious spring ,</l>
     <l n="74">Careless with her , whether the days that flee</l>
     <l n="75">Pale drouth or golden-fruited plenty see ,</l>
     <l n="76">So that we toil , brothers , without distress ,</l>
     <l n="77">In calm-eyed peace and godlike blamelessness .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AN OCTOBER SUNSET .</head>
     <l n="1">One moment the slim cloudflakes seem to lean</l>
     <l n="2">With their sad sunward faces aureoled ,</l>
     <l n="3">And longing lips set downward brightening</l>
     <l n="4">To take the last sweet hand kiss of the king ,</l>
     <l n="5">Gone down beyond the closing west acold ;</l>
     <l n="6">Paying no reverence to the slender queen ,</l>
     <l n="7">That like a curvèd olive leaf of gold</l>
     <l n="8">Hangs low in heaven , rounded toward sun ,</l>
     <l n="9">Or the small stars that one by one unfold</l>
     <l n="10">Down the gray border of the night begun .</l>

      <l n="1">Breathers of wisdom won without a quest ,</l>
      <l n="2">Quaint uncouth dreamers , voices high and strange ,</l>
      <l n="3">Flutists of lands where beauty hath no change ,</l>
      <l n="4">And wintery grief is a forgotten guest ,</l>
      <l n="5">Sweet murmurers of everlasting rest ,</l>
      <l n="6">For whom glad days have ever yet to run ,</l>
      <l n="7">And moments are as æons , and the sun</l>
      <l n="8">But ever sunken half-way toward the west .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="9">Often to me who heard you in your day ,</l>

      <l n="11">That earth , our mother , searching in what way ,</l>
      <l n="12">Men 's hearts might know her spirit 's inmost dream ,</l>
      <l n="13">Ever at rest beneath life 's change and stir ,</l>

      <l n="15">In those mute days when spring was in her glee ,</l>
      <l n="16">And hope was strong , we knew not why or how ,</l>
      <l n="17">And earth , the mother , dreamed with brooding brow .</l>
      <l n="18">Musing on life , and what the hours might be ,</l>
      <l n="19">When love should ripen to maternity ,</l>
      <l n="20">Then like high flutes in silvery interchange</l>
      <l n="21">Ye piped with voices still and sweet and strange ,</l>

     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="23">The great buds swelled ; among the pensive woods</l>
      <l n="24">The spirits of first flowers awoke and flung</l>
      <l n="25">From buried faces the close fitting hoods ,</l>
      <l n="26">And listened to your piping till they fell ,</l>
      <l n="27">The frail spring-beauty with her perfumed bell ,</l>

      <l n="31">Stood in a dream , as it were moorèd there</l>
      <l n="32">Forever in a noon-tide reverie ,</l>
      <l n="33">Or where the birds made riot of their glee</l>
      <l n="34">In the still woods , and the hot sun shone down ,</l>
      <l n="35">Crossed with warm lucent shadows on the brown</l>

      <l n="40">Nestled and slept among the noiseless reeds ,</l>

     <l n="4">Rejoicing in its idle strength . ‘ Tis then ,</l>
     <l n="5">And only at such moments , that we know</l>

     <l n="7">Sweet voices and words bright and beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="8">Impetuous deeds that woke the God within us ,</l>
     <l n="9">The loveliness of forms and thoughts and colors ,</l>
     <l n="10">A moment marked and then as soon forgotten .</l>
     <l n="11">These things are ever near us , laid away ,</l>
     <l n="12">Hidden and waiting the appropriate times ,</l>
     <l n="13">In the quiet garner-house of memory .</l>

     <l n="15">Beneath the heated strainage and the rush</l>
     <l n="16">That teem the noisy surface of the hours ,</l>
     <l n="17">All things that ever touched us are stored up ,</l>
     <l n="18">Growing more mellow like sealed wine with age ;</l>
     <l n="19">We thought them dead , and they are but asleep .</l>
     <l n="20">In moments when the heart is most at rest</l>
     <l n="21">And least expectant , from the luminous doors ,</l>

     <l n="29">Like him who reads upon an outstretched map ,</l>

     <l n="31">Out of that magic well-stored picture house ,</l>
     <l n="32">No dream , rather a thing most keenly real ,</l>

     <l n="34">Arrested and spell bound , and captured eyes ,</l>
     <l n="35">Made wide with joy and wonder , I beheld</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="40">I had walked out , as I remember now ,</l>
     <l n="41">With covered ears , for the bright air was keen ,</l>
     <l n="42">To southward up the gleaming snow-packed fields ,</l>
     <l n="43">With the snowshoer 's long rejoicing stride ,</l>
     <l n="44">Marching at ease . It was a radiant day</l>
     <l n="45">In February , the month of the great struggle</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Twixt sun and frost , when with advancing spears ,</l>
     <l n="47">The glittering golden vanguard of the spring</l>
     <l n="48">Holds the broad winter 's yet unbroken rear</l>
     <l n="49">In long-closed wavering contest . Thin pale threads</l>
     <l n="50">Like streaks of ash across the far off blue</l>
     <l n="51">Were drawn , nor seemed to move . A brooding silence</l>
     <l n="52">Kept all the land , a stillness as of sleep ;</l>
     <l n="53">But in the east the grey and motionless woods ,</l>
     <l n="54">Watching the great sun 's fiery slow decline ,</l>
     <l n="55">Grew deep with gold . To westward all was silver .</l>
     <l n="56">An hour had passed above me ; I had reached</l>
     <l n="57">The loftiest level of the snow-piled fields ,</l>
     <l n="58">Clear eyed , but unobservant , noting not ,</l>
     <l n="59">That all the plain beneath me and the hills</l>
     <l n="60">Took on a change of color splendid , gradual ,</l>
     <l n="61">Leaving no spot the same ; nor that the sun</l>
     <l n="62">Now like a fiery torrent overflamed</l>
     <l n="63">The great line of the west . Ere yet I turned</l>
     <l n="64">With long stride homeward , being heated</l>
     <l n="65">With the loose swinging motion , weary too ,</l>
     <l n="66">Nor uninclined to rest , a buried fence ,</l>
     <l n="67">Whose topmost log just shouldered from the snow ,</l>
     <l n="68">Made me a seat , and thence with heated cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="69">Grazed by the northwind 's edge of stinging ice ,</l>
     <l n="70">I looked far out upon the snow-bound waste ,</l>
     <l n="71">The lifting hills and intersecting forests ,</l>
     <l n="72">The scarce marked courses of the buried streams ,</l>
     <l n="73">And as I looked lost memory of the frost ,</l>
     <l n="74">Transfixed with wonder , overborne with joy .</l>
     <l n="75">I saw them in their silence and their beauty ,</l>
     <l n="76">Swept by the sunset 's rapid hand of fire ,</l>
     <l n="77">Sudden , mysterious , every moment deepening</l>
     <l n="78">To some new majesty of rose or flame .</l>
     <l n="79">The whole broad west was like a molten sea</l>
     <l n="80">Of crimson . In the north the light-lined hills</l>
     <l n="81">Were veiled far off as with a mist of rose</l>
     <l n="82">Wondrous and soft . Along the darkening east</l>
     <l n="83">The gold of all the forests slowly changed</l>
     <l n="84">To purple . In the valley far before me ,</l>
     <l n="85">Low sunk in sapphire shadows , from its hills ,</l>
     <l n="86">Softer and lovelier than an opening flower ,</l>
     <l n="87">Uprose a city with its sun-touched towers ,</l>
     <l n="88">A bunch of amethysts .</l>
     <l n="89">Like one spell-bound</l>
     <l n="90">Caught in the presence of some god , I stood ,</l>
     <l n="91">Nor felt the keen wind and the deadly air ,</l>
     <l n="92">But watched the sun go down , and watched the gold</l>
     <l n="93">Fade from the town and the withdrawing hills ,</l>
     <l n="94">Their westward shapes athwart the dusky red</l>
     <l n="95">Freeze into sapphire , saw the arc of rose</l>
     <l n="96">Rise ever higher in the violet east ,</l>
     <l n="97">Above the frore front of the uprearing night</l>
     <l n="98">Remorsefully soft and sweet . Then I awoke</l>
     <l n="99">As from a dream , and from my shoulders shook</l>
     <l n="100">The warning chill , till then unfelt , unfeared .</l>

    <head>THE ORGANIST .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In his dim chapel day by day</l>
     <l n="2">The organist was wont to play ,</l>
     <l n="3">And please himself with fluted reveries ;</l>
     <l n="4">And all the spirit 's joy and strife ,</l>
     <l n="5">The longing of a tender life ,</l>
     <l n="6">Took sound and form upon the ivory keys ;</l>
     <l n="7">And though he seldom spoke a word ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">One day as he was wrapped , a sound</l>
     <l n="11">Of feet stole near ; he turned and found</l>
     <l n="12">A little maid that stood beside him there .</l>
     <l n="13">She started , and in shrinking-wise</l>
     <l n="14">Besought him with her liquid eyes</l>
     <l n="15">And little features , very sweet and spare .</l>
     <l n="16">“ You love the music , child , ” he said ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">She answered , “ At the door one day</l>
     <l n="20">I sat and heard the organ play ;</l>

     <l n="22">But yesterday , a little while ,</l>
     <l n="23">I crept half up the empty aisle</l>
     <l n="24">And heard the music sounding sweet and clear ;</l>
     <l n="25">To-day I thought you would not mind ,</l>
     <l n="26">For , master dear , your face was kind ,</l>
     <l n="27">And so I came up here . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">“ You love the music then , ” he said ,</l>

     <l n="30">And followed out some winding reverie ;</l>
     <l n="31">“ And you are poor ? ” said he at last ;</l>
     <l n="32">The maiden nodded , and he passed</l>
     <l n="33">His hand across his forehead dreamingly ;</l>
     <l n="34">“ And will you be my friend ? ” he spake ,</l>
     <l n="35">“ And on the organ learn to make</l>
     <l n="36">Grand music here with me ? ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">And all the little maiden 's face</l>
     <l n="38">Was kindled with a grateful grace ;</l>
     <l n="39">“ Oh , master , teach me ; I will slave for thee ! ”</l>
     <l n="40">She cried ; and so the child grew dear</l>
     <l n="41">To him , and slowly year by year</l>
     <l n="42">He taught her all the organ 's majesty ;</l>
     <l n="43">And gave her from his slender store</l>
     <l n="44">Bread and warm clothing , that no more</l>
     <l n="45">Her cheeks were pinched to see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">And year by year the maiden grew</l>
     <l n="47">Taller and lovelier , and the hue</l>
     <l n="48">Deepened upon her tender cheeks untried .</l>
     <l n="49">Rounder , and queenlier , and more fair</l>
     <l n="50">Her form grew , and her golden hair</l>
     <l n="51">Fell yearly richer at the master 's side .</l>
     <l n="52">In speech and bearing , form and face ,</l>
     <l n="53">Sweeter and graver , grace by grace ,</l>
     <l n="54">Her beauties multiplied .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">And sometimes at his work a glow</l>
     <l n="56">Would touch him , and he murmured low ,</l>
     <l n="57">“ How beautiful she is ? ” and bent his head ;</l>
     <l n="58">And sometimes when the day went by</l>
     <l n="59">And brought no maiden he would sigh ,</l>
     <l n="60">And lean and listen for her velvet tread ;</l>
     <l n="61">And he would drop his hands and say ,</l>
     <l n="62">“ My music cometh not to-day ;</l>

     <l n="67">Such heavenly things the master wrought ,</l>
     <l n="68">That in his happy dreams he thought</l>
     <l n="69">The organ 's self did love the gold-haired maid :</l>
     <l n="70">But she , the maiden , never guessed</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">At last , one summer morning fair ,</l>
     <l n="74">The maiden came with braided hair</l>

     <l n="78">Of life be smooth , not bitter unto me . ”</l>
     <l n="79">He stirred not ; but the light did go</l>
     <l n="80">Out of his shrunken cheeks , and oh !</l>
     <l n="81">His head hung heavily .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="82">“ You love him , then ? ” “ I love him well , ”</l>

     <l n="85">A glory , half a smile , abode</l>
     <l n="86">Within the maiden 's eyes and glowed</l>
     <l n="87">Upon her parted lips . The master said ,</l>
     <l n="88">“ God bless and bless thee , little maid ,</l>

     <l n="98">His hands across the keys at last ,</l>
     <l n="99">And made the organ moan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="100">The organ shook , the music wept ;</l>

     <l n="106">The people gathered from the street ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="109">And there they sat till dawning light ,</l>

     <l n="112">But on a sudden ceased the sound :</l>
     <l n="113">Like ghosts the people gathered round ,</l>
     <l n="114">And on the keys they found his fallen head .</l>
     <l n="115">The silent organ had received</l>
     <l n="116">The master 's broken heart relieved ,</l>
     <l n="117">And he was white and dead .</l>

     <l n="72">Or luckless footsteps of the stealthy Pan ,</l>
     <l n="73">Creeping at night among the noiseless steeps</l>
     <l n="74">And hollows of the Erymanthian woods ,</l>
     <l n="75">Roused her from sleep . With listening head ,</l>
     <l n="76">Snatched bow , and quiver lightly slung , she stands ,</l>
     <l n="77">And peers across that dim and motionless glade ,</l>
     <l n="78">Beckoning about her heels the wakeful dogs ;</l>
     <l n="79">Yet Dian , thus alert , is but a dream ,</l>
     <l n="80">Making more real this brooding quietness .</l>
     <l n="81">How strong and wonderful is night ! Mankind</l>
     <l n="82">Has yielded all to one sweet helplessness :</l>
     <l n="83">Thought , labour , strife and all activities</l>

     <l n="85">Rolling across the fields of Attica ,</l>
     <l n="86">Hath covered all the labouring villages .</l>
     <l n="87">Even great Athens with her busy hands</l>
     <l n="88">And busier tongues lies quiet beneath it 's waves .</l>
     <l n="89">Only a steady murmur seems to come</l>
     <l n="90">Up from her silentness , as if the land</l>
     <l n="91">Were breathing heavily in dreams . Abroad</l>
     <l n="92">No creature stirs , not even the reveller ,</l>
     <l n="93">Staggering , unlanterned , from the cool Piræus ,</l>
     <l n="94">With drunken shout . The remnants of the feast ,</l>
     <l n="95">The crumpled cushions and the broken wreathes ,</l>
     <l n="96">Lie scattered in yon shadowy court , whose stones</l>
     <l n="97">Through the warm hours drink up the staining wine .</l>
     <l n="98">The bridal oxen in their well-filled stalls</l>
     <l n="99">Sleep , mindless of the happy weight they drew .</l>
     <l n="100">The torch is charred ; the garlands at the door ,</l>
     <l n="101">So gay at morning with their bright festoons ,</l>
     <l n="102">Hang limp and withered ; and the joyous flutes</l>
     <l n="103">Are empty of all sound . Only my brain</l>
     <l n="104">Holds now in it 's remote unsleeping depths</l>
     <l n="105">The echo of the tender hymenæos</l>
     <l n="106">And memory of the modest lips that sang it .</l>
     <l n="107">Within the silent thalamos the queen ,</l>
     <l n="108">The sea-sprung radiant Cytherean reigns ,</l>
     <l n="109">And with her smiling lips and fathomless eyes</l>
     <l n="110">Regards the lovers , knowing that this hour</l>
     <l n="111">Is theirs once only . Earth and thought and time</l>
     <l n="112">Lie far beyond them , a great gulf of joy ,</l>
     <l n="113">Absorbing fear , regret and every grief ,</l>
     <l n="114">A warm eternity : or now perchance</l>
     <l n="115">Night and the very weight of happiness ,</l>
     <l n="116">Unsought , have turned upon their tremulous eyes</l>
     <l n="117">The mindless stream of sleep ; nor do they care</l>
     <l n="118">If dawn should never come .</l>

     <l n="123">The hunger of some wakeful hour like this ,</l>
     <l n="124">The flowers , the myrtles , the gay bridal train ,</l>

     <l n="129">The good Lysippe with her down-cast eyes ,</l>
     <l n="130">Touched with soft fear , half scared at all the noise ,</l>
     <l n="131">Whose tears were ready as her laughter , fresh ,</l>
     <l n="132">And modest as some pink anemone .</l>
     <l n="133">How young she looked , and how her smiling lips</l>
     <l n="134">Betrayed her happiness . Ah , who can tell ,</l>
     <l n="135">How often , when no watchful eye was near ,</l>
     <l n="136">Her eager fingers , trembling and ashamed ,</l>
     <l n="137">Essayed the apple-pips , or strewed the floor</l>
     <l n="138">With broken poppy petals . Next to her ,</l>
     <l n="139">Theron himself the gladest goodliest figure ,</l>
     <l n="140">His honest face ruddy with health and joy ,</l>
     <l n="141">And smiling like the Ægean , when the sun</l>

     <l n="143">Comes in from Melos , rippling all its floor :</l>

     <l n="148">Seemed to return , and in her aged eyes</l>
     <l n="149">The waning fire rekindled : little Mæon ,</l>
     <l n="150">That mischievous satyr with his tipsy wreath ,</l>
     <l n="151">Who kept us laughing at his pranks , and made</l>
     <l n="152">Old Pyrrho angry . Him too sleep hath bound</l>

     <l n="155">Even in sleep his little limbs , I think ,</l>
     <l n="156">Twitch restlessly , and still his tongue gibes on</l>
     <l n="157">With inarticulate murmur . Ah , quaint Mæon !</l>

     <l n="160">Of things that creep encumbered with huge burdens</l>
     <l n="161">Gloom and infest her through these dragging hours ,</l>

     <l n="330">Rose with the growth of morning , till we reached</l>
     <l n="331">That moss-hung fountain on the hillside near</l>
     <l n="332">Cleonæ , where the dark anemones</l>
     <l n="333">Cover the ground , and make it red like fire .</l>
     <l n="334">Could ever grief , I wonder , or fixed care ,</l>

     <l n="339">The leafy shadows , the warm blossoming earth ,</l>
     <l n="340">Drew near with their voluptuous eloquence ,</l>
     <l n="341">And melted him . Ah , what a talk we had !</l>
     <l n="342">How eagerly our nimble tongues ran on ,</l>
     <l n="343">With linkèd wit , in joyous sympathy .</l>
     <l n="344">Such hours , I think , are better than long years</l>
     <l n="345">Of brooding loneliness , mind touching mind</l>
     <l n="346">To leaping life , and thought sustaining thought ,</l>
     <l n="347">Till even the darkest chambers of grey time ,</l>
     <l n="348">His ancient seats , and bolted mysteries ,</l>
     <l n="349">Open their hoary doors , and at a look</l>
     <l n="350">Lay all their treasures bare . How , when our thought</l>
     <l n="351">Wheeling on ever bolder wings at last</l>
     <l n="352">Grew as it seemed too large for utterance ,</l>
     <l n="353">We both fell silent , striving to recall</l>
     <l n="354">And grasp such things as in our daring mood</l>
     <l n="355">We had but glimpsed and leaped at ; yet how long</l>
     <l n="356">We studied thus with absent eyes , I know not ;</l>
     <l n="357">Our thought died slowly out ; the busy road ,</l>
     <l n="358">The voices of the passers-by , the change</l>
     <l n="359">Of garb and feature , and the various tongues</l>
     <l n="360">Absorbed us . Ah , how clearly I recall them !</l>
     <l n="361">For in these silent wakeful hours the mind</l>
     <l n="362">Is strangely swift . With what sharp lines</l>
     <l n="363">The shapes of things that even years have buried</l>
     <l n="364">Shine out upon the rapid memory ,</l>
     <l n="365">Moving and warm like life . I can see now</l>

     <l n="367">Outlandish dialect and impudent gait</l>
     <l n="368">Awoke Euktemon 's laughter . In mine ear</l>

     <l n="372">And brace of slaves , the old ship captain tanned</l>
     <l n="373">With sweeping sea-winds and the pitiless sun ,</l>
     <l n="374">But best of all that dainty amorous pair ,</l>
     <l n="375">Whose youthful spirit neither heat nor toil</l>
     <l n="376">Could conquer . What a charming group they made ?</l>
     <l n="377">The creaking litter and the long brown poles ,</l>
     <l n="378">The sinewy bearers with their cat-like stride ,</l>
     <l n="379">Dripping with sweat , that merry dark-eyed girl ,</l>
     <l n="380">Whose sudden beauty shook us from our dreams ,</l>
     <l n="381">And chained our eyes . How beautiful she was ?</l>
     <l n="382">Half-hid among the gay Miletian cushions ,</l>
     <l n="383">The lovely laughing face , the gracious form ,</l>
     <l n="384">The fragrant lightly-knotted hair , and eyes</l>
     <l n="385">Full of the dancing fire of wanton Corinth .</l>
     <l n="386">That happy stripling , whose delighted feet</l>
     <l n="387">Swung at her side , whose tongue ran on so gaily ,</l>
     <l n="388">Is it for him alone she wreathes those smiles ,</l>
     <l n="389">And tunes so musically that flexile voice ,</l>
     <l n="390">Soft as the Lydian flute ? Surely his gait</l>
     <l n="391">Proclaimed the lover , and his well-filled girdle</l>
     <l n="392">Not less the lover 's strength . How joyously</l>
     <l n="393">He strode , unmindful of his ruffled curls ,</l>
     <l n="394">Whose perfumes still went wide upon the wind ,</l>
     <l n="395">His dust-stained robe unheeded , and the stones</l>
     <l n="396">Whose ragged edges frayed his delicate shoes .</l>
     <l n="397">How radiant , how full of hope he was !</l>
     <l n="398">What pleasant memories , how many things</l>
     <l n="399">Rose up again before me , as I lay</l>
     <l n="400">Half-stretched among the crushed anemones ,</l>
     <l n="401">And watched them , till a far off jutting ledge</l>
     <l n="402">Precluded sight , still listening till mine ears</l>
     <l n="403">Caught the last vanishing murmur of their talk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="404">Only a little longer ; then we rose</l>

     <l n="406">Toward Corinth ; but our talk , I know not why ,</l>
     <l n="407">Fell for that day . I wonder what there was</l>
     <l n="408">About those dainty lovers or their speech ,</l>
     <l n="409">That changed Euktemon 's mood ; for all the way</l>
     <l n="410">From high Cleonæ to the city gates ,</l>
     <l n="411">Till sunset found us loitering without aim ,</l>
     <l n="412">Half lost among the dusky-moving crowds ,</l>
     <l n="413">I could get nothing from him but dark looks ,</l>
     <l n="414">Short answers and the old defiant stride .</l>
     <l n="415">Some memory pricked him . It may be , perchance ,</l>
     <l n="416">A woman 's treachery , some luckless passion ,</l>
     <l n="417">In former days endured , hath seared his blood ,</l>
     <l n="418">And dowered him with that cureless bitter humour .</l>
     <l n="419">To him solitude and the wanderer 's life</l>
     <l n="420">Alone are sweet , the tumults of this world</l>
     <l n="421">A thing unworthy of the wise man 's touch ,</l>
     <l n="422">Its joys and sorrows to be met alike</l>
     <l n="423">With broad-browed scorn . One quality at least</l>
     <l n="424">We have in common ; we are idlers both ,</l>
     <l n="425">Shifters and wanderers through this sleepless world ,</l>
     <l n="426">Albeit in different moods . ‘ Tis that , I think ,</l>
     <l n="427">That knit us , and the universal need</l>
     <l n="428">For near companionship . Howe'er it be ,</l>
     <l n="429">There is no hand that I would gladlier grasp ,</l>
     <l n="430">Either on earth or in the nether gloom ,</l>
     <l n="431">When the grey keel shall grind the Stygian strand ,</l>
     <l n="432">Than stern Euktemon 's .</l>
