     <l n="45">So fraught is she with innocent delight ,</l>
     <l n="46">She feels the tender thrill of his embrace</l>
     <l n="47">Crushing her lilies into flowery lace ;</l>
     <l n="48">Then sighs and starts , even as though from fright .</l>

     <l n="52">Blank are its pages from the first to last .</l>
     <l n="53">She hears faint music , smiles , and leaves the room</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="64">Tell me how many times it has known pain ;</l>

     <l n="71">A smile is curving o'er her creamy cheek ,</l>
     <l n="72">Her bosom swells with all a lover 's joy ,</l>
     <l n="73">When love receives a message that the coy</l>
     <l n="74">Young love-god made a strong and true heart speak</l>
     <l n="75">From far-off lands ; and like a mountain-peak</l>
     <l n="76">That loses in one avalanche its cloy</l>

     <l n="78">Its hidden store of blushes ; and they wreak</l>
     <l n="79">Destruction , as they crush my aching heart ,—</l>
     <l n="80">Destruction , wild , relentless , and as sure</l>
     <l n="81">As the poor Alpine hamlet 's ; and no art</l>
     <l n="82">Can hide my agony , no herb can cure</l>
     <l n="83">My wound . Her very blush says , “ We must part . ”</l>

     <l n="89">Till she gave that rose from her hair ,</l>
     <l n="90">And leaned out over the stair</l>
     <l n="91">With a blush as she stooped to pin it .</l>
