      <head>THE DAYS</head>
       <l n="1">A long grim corridor — a sullen bar</l>
       <l n="2">Of light athwart the darkness — where no fleet</l>
       <l n="3">Pale sunshine spreads for dark his winding sheet</l>
       <l n="4">A light , not born of noon nor placid star</l>
       <l n="5">Glows lurid thro ’ the gloom — while from afar ,</l>
       <l n="6">Beats marching of innumerable feet .</l>
       <l n="7">Is this the place where tragic armies meet ?</l>
       <l n="8">The throb of terror that presages war ?—</l>
       <l n="9">I strain to see , then softly on my sight</l>
       <l n="10">There falls the vision , manifold they come —</l>
       <l n="11">White listless Day chained to her brother Night —</l>
       <l n="12">Their hands are shackled and their lips are dumb ,</l>
       <l n="13">And as they meet the air where each one dies ,</l>
       <l n="14">They turn and smile at me — with weary eyes .</l>

      <head>THE EVERLASTING SNOWS</head>
       <l n="1">And shall it be that these undaunted snows</l>
       <l n="2">That poise so lightly on the mountains ’ crest —</l>
       <l n="3">A lily laid to cheer its lonely breast —</l>
       <l n="4">Shall their chill smile still face the wind , that blows</l>
       <l n="5">Across the field whereon no blossom grows ,</l>
       <l n="6">And light the land where no gay life may rest</l>
       <l n="7">Save glowing hasty fingers of the West ,</l>
       <l n="8">When our two hearts lie cold beneath the rose ?</l>
       <l n="9">These silver flakes of ancient hoary frost ,</l>
       <l n="10">Surviving all our joys ’ supremest powers ,</l>
       <l n="11">And though the petals of your lips be lost</l>
       <l n="12">And gone the summer of your golden head ,</l>
       <l n="13">This pale eternal growth of winter 's flowers</l>
       <l n="14">Shall still live on — though our sweet love be dead .</l>

      <head>THRONE AND ALTAR</head>
       <l n="1">He had a vision of a golden throne</l>
       <l n="2">Fronting an altar ; both alike were bare ,</l>
       <l n="3">But o'er the purple of the regal chair</l>
       <l n="4">Blazed the device , “ I wait for him alone</l>
       <l n="5">Who with the world has held his soul his own . ”</l>
       <l n="6">He sadly turned , this height he could not dare .</l>
       <l n="7">But — Stay — the text upon the altar there —</l>
       <l n="8">“ I wait for him who has not made a moan</l>
       <l n="9">Howe'er his kind have used his heaven-sent dower .</l>
       <l n="10">Fear not , and burn thine incense , lowly heart . ”</l>
       <l n="11">And sudden brightness turns the averted face ,</l>
       <l n="12">To holy sense of majesty and power —</l>
       <l n="13">And a voice :— “ Master — this indeed thou art . ”</l>
       <l n="14">Wondrous music trembles thro ’ the space .</l>

      <head>EAST AND WEST</head>
       <l n="1">You have not ceased for me . Though stern-browed Fate</l>
       <l n="2">Laid our two paths apart ; when in the West</l>
       <l n="3">She gave you over to the seas , and great</l>
       <l n="4">Wide winds of enterprise , and set your breast</l>
       <l n="5">Against the suns and shadows of the earth ;</l>
       <l n="6">Then with a gilded largess , led my ways</l>
       <l n="7">Toward the time-worn East , who paints her dearth</l>
       <l n="8">With purple vain imaginings ; the praise</l>
       <l n="9">Of all her languid incense and the pride</l>
       <l n="10">Of ancient mysteries and hopeless creeds</l>
       <l n="11">Hold for my heart no spell when warm and wide</l>
       <l n="12">I see across the blue of Isis ’ veil</l>
       <l n="13">The thunderous breakers of your ocean pale</l>
       <l n="14">And glints of prairie sun through river reeds .</l>

      <head>THE BATTLE</head>
       <l n="1">The pallid waves caress the paler sand ,</l>
       <l n="2">Falter and tremble , then reluctant wane ,</l>
       <l n="3">Fearing advance , yet venturing again .</l>
       <l n="4">Grey deep sea waves that never knew the land ,</l>
       <l n="5">Tired with the tumult , stretch a crooked hand</l>
       <l n="6">To win a precious sweet surcease from pain ,</l>
       <l n="7">But , glancing back upon the mighty main ,</l>
       <l n="8">Perforce return to swell the strong command .</l>
       <l n="9">So fretful Life sees Death 's cold sands and faints</l>
       <l n="10">To fling thereon the wearing of her wave ,</l>
       <l n="11">Yet , turning ere she finds the gloomy shore ,</l>
       <l n="12">Seeing ahead the idle senseless grave ,</l>
       <l n="13">Behind — the Kings , the Patriots and the Saints ,</l>
       <l n="14">She sighing turns to face the fight once more .</l>

      <head>WATER AND WINE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I asked for water and they brought me wine ;</l>
       <l n="2">Wine in a jewelled chalice , where the gold</l>
       <l n="3">Gleamed thro ’ the purple beads , as if unrolled —</l>
       <l n="4">One saw the sun-rays of a life-time shine .</l>
       <l n="5">So drinking , I forgot my dream divine</l>
       <l n="6">Of crystal purity , for in my hold</l>
       <l n="7">Were wealth and Fame and Passions manifold</l>
       <l n="8">Which with the draught I fancied might be mine .</l>

       <l n="9">“ Ah , Youth , ” I said , “ Ah , Faith and Love ! ” I said ;</l>

       <l n="11">What shall remain when all these things are sped ? ”</l>
       <l n="12">Then crashed the dream . I clutched the hand of Fate</l>
       <l n="13">Amid the ruins of my shattered life ,</l>
       <l n="14">And found the Gods had cheated , all too late .</l>

       <l n="1">Cruel and fair ! within thy hollowed hand</l>
       <l n="2">My heart is lying as a little rose ,</l>
       <l n="3">So faint and faded , scarce could one suppose</l>
       <l n="4">It might look in thine eyes and understand</l>
       <l n="5">The song they sing unto a weary land ,</l>
       <l n="6">Making it radiant , yet because I dare ,</l>
       <l n="7">To love thee , being weak , lose not thine air</l>

       <l n="12">Grant me the tragic deepness of the cup ,</l>
       <l n="13">And when thine eyes have flashed and made me blind ,</l>
       <l n="14">Kill me beneath the shadow of thy smile .</l>

      <head>A DREAM IN FEVER</head>
       <l n="1">A vast screen of unequal downward lines ,</l>
       <l n="2">An orange purple halo ‘ round the rain ,</l>
       <l n="3">Twists from a space whose very size is pain .</l>
       <l n="4">Here in this vortex day with night combines ;</l>
       <l n="5">Ruby and Emerald glint their blazing spines ;</l>
       <l n="6">Closing and smothering , wheels a brazen main ,</l>
       <l n="7">A shuddering sea of silence ; in its train</l>
       <l n="8">A Thought — a cry , whose snake — fear trembling twines</l>
       <l n="9">Around — above — alive yet uttered not ;</l>
       <l n="10">But my heart hears — and shrieking dies of dread ,</l>
       <l n="11">Then soaring breaks its bands and o'er the rim</l>
       <l n="12">White winged it rends the dark with jagged blot ,</l>
       <l n="13">Glimpsing the iris gateway barred ahead ,</l>

       <l n="2">My heart 's loud beating , as I strain to see</l>
       <l n="3">Across the rain forlorn and hopelessly ,</l>
       <l n="4">Nor starting , think ‘ tis he that draws so near .</l>
       <l n="5">I will forget how tenderly and dear</l>
       <l n="6">He might in coming hold his arms to me ,</l>

       <l n="1">I have a dream , that somewhere in the days ,</l>
       <l n="2">Since when a myriad suns have burned and died ,</l>
       <l n="3">There was a time my soul was not for pride</l>
       <l n="4">Of spendthrift youth , the pensioner who pays</l>
       <l n="5">Dole for the pain of searching thro ’ the haze</l>
       <l n="6">Where joy lies hidden . As the puff balls ride ,</l>
       <l n="7">The wandering wind across the Summer 's side —</l>
       <l n="8">So winged my spirit in a golden blaze</l>
       <l n="9">Of pure and careless Present — Future naught</l>
       <l n="10">But a sad dotard 's wail — and I was young ,</l>
       <l n="11">Who now am old . Now years like flashes seem ,</l>
       <l n="12">Lambent or grey on the great wall of Thought —</l>
       <l n="13">This is a song a poet may have sung —</l>

       <l n="3">Slip thro ’ the waving mist in strange eclipse ,</l>
       <l n="4">Like spirits of some time and land of yore .</l>
       <l n="5">I did not think my heart could love thee more ,</l>

       <l n="7">The wind lays ghostly kisses on my lips</l>
       <l n="8">I seem to know of love the eternal core .</l>
       <l n="9">Here is no throbbing of impassioned breath</l>
       <l n="10">To beat upon my cheek , no pulsing heart</l>
       <l n="11">Which might be silenced by the touch of Death ,</l>

       <l n="2">Over my head , by the rough crag-points high ,</l>
       <l n="3">Seems rent and torn the tender hovering sky ,</l>
       <l n="4">Till almost — thro ’ — I see a Heaven-spark burn ;</l>
       <l n="5">Then downward to the sleeping world I yearn</l>
       <l n="6">Whose eyes so heavy droop they may not try</l>
       <l n="7">To catch the higher gleam — and live thereby —</l>
       <l n="8">Youth passes graveward — and they never learn .</l>
       <l n="9">Then faint with brooding o'er a careless earth</l>
       <l n="10">I turn to Nature and her broad warm breast ,</l>
       <l n="11">Strive for a friendship with her sun-burnt mirth ,</l>
       <l n="12">Teach my sad soul to catch her cadence deep ,</l>

       <l n="2">As sobbing echoes of a dead refrain ,</l>

       <l n="1">Earth holds no sweeter secret anywhere</l>

       <l n="4">Like tall pale ladies whose delicious hair</l>
       <l n="5">Lures and invites the kiss of wanton air .</l>
       <l n="6">The smooth soft grasses , delicate between</l>
