    <head>I .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A dull little station , a man with the eye</l>
     <l n="2">Of a dreamer ; a bevy of girls moving by ;</l>
     <l n="3">A swift moving train and a hot Summer sun ,</l>
     <l n="4">The curtain goes up , and our play is begun .</l>
     <l n="5">The drama of passion , of sorrow , of strife ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which always is billed for the theatre Life .</l>
     <l n="7">It runs on forever , from year unto year ,</l>
     <l n="8">With scarcely a change when new actors appear .</l>
     <l n="9">It is old as the world is — far older in truth ,</l>
     <l n="10">For the world is a crude little planet of youth .</l>
     <l n="11">And back in the eras before it was formed ,</l>
     <l n="12">The passions of hearts through the Universe stormed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Maurice Somerville passed the cluster of girls</l>
     <l n="14">Who twisted their ribbons and fluttered their curls</l>
     <l n="15">In vain to attract him ; his mind it was plain</l>
     <l n="16">Was wholly intent on the incoming train .</l>
     <l n="17">That great one eyed monster puffed out its black breath ,</l>
     <l n="18">Shrieked , snorted and hissed , like a thing bent on death ,</l>
     <l n="19">Paused scarcely a moment , and then sped away ,</l>
     <l n="20">And two actors more now enliven our play .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">A graceful young woman with eyes like the morn ,</l>
     <l n="22">With hair like the tassels which hang from the corn ,</l>
     <l n="23">And a face that might serve as a model for Peace ,</l>
     <l n="24">Moved lightly along , smiled and bowed to Maurice ,</l>
     <l n="25">Then was lost in the circle of friends waiting near .</l>
     <l n="26">A discord of shrill nasal tones smote the ear ,</l>
     <l n="27">As they greeted their comrade and bore her from sight .</l>
     <l n="28">( The ear oft is pained while the eye feels delight</l>
     <l n="29">In the presence of women throughout our fair land :</l>
     <l n="30">God gave them the graces which win and command ,</l>
     <l n="31">But the devil , who always in mischief rejoices ,</l>
     <l n="32">Slipped into their teachers and ruined their voices . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">There had stepped from the train just behind Mabel Lee</l>
     <l n="34">A man whose deportment bespoke him to be</l>
     <l n="35">A child of good fortune . His mien and his air</l>
     <l n="36">Were those of one all unaccustomed to care .</l>
     <l n="37">His brow was not vexed with the gold seeker 's worry ,</l>
     <l n="38">His manner was free from the national hurry .</l>
     <l n="39">Repose marked his movements . Yet gaze in his eye ,</l>
     <l n="40">And you saw that this calm outer man was a lie ;</l>
     <l n="41">And you knew that deep down in the depths of his breast</l>
     <l n="42">There dwelt the unmerciful imp of unrest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="43">He held out his hand ; it was clasped with a will</l>
     <l n="44">In both the firm palms of Maurice Somerville .</l>
     <l n="45">“ Well , Reese , my old Comrade ; ” “ Ha , Roger , my boy , ”</l>
     <l n="46">They cried in a breath , and their eyes gemmed with joy</l>
     <l n="47">( Which but for their sex had been set in a tear ) ,</l>
     <l n="48">As they walked arm in arm to the trap waiting near ,</l>
     <l n="49">And drove down the shining shell roadway which wound</l>
     <l n="50">Through forest and meadow , in search of the Sound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">Roger :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="52">I smell the salt water — that perfume which starts</l>
     <l n="53">The blood from hot brains back to world withered hearts ;</l>
     <l n="54">You may talk of the fragrance of flower filled fields ,</l>
     <l n="55">You may sing of the odors the Orient yields ,</l>
     <l n="56">You may tell of the health laden scent of the pine ,</l>
     <l n="57">But give me the subtle salt breath of the brine .</l>
     <l n="58">Already I feel lost emotions of youth</l>
     <l n="59">Steal back to my soul in their sweetness and truth ;</l>
     <l n="60">Small wonder the years leave no marks on your face ,</l>
     <l n="61">Time 's scythe gathers rust in this idyllic place .</l>
     <l n="62">You must feel like a child on the Great Mother 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="63">With the Sound like a nurse watching over your rest ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">Maurice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">There is beauty and truth in your quaint simile ,</l>
     <l n="66">I love the Sound more than the broad open sea .</l>
     <l n="67">The ocean seems always stern , masculine , bold ,</l>
     <l n="68">The Sound is a woman , now warm , and now cold .</l>
     <l n="69">It rises in fury and threatens to smite ,</l>
     <l n="70">Then falls at your feet with a coo of delight ;</l>
     <l n="71">Capricious , seductive , first frowning , then smiling ,</l>
     <l n="72">And always , whatever its mood is , beguiling .</l>
     <l n="73">Look , now you can see it , bright beautiful blue ,</l>
     <l n="74">And far in the distance there loom into view</l>
     <l n="75">The banks of Long Island , full thirty miles off ;</l>
     <l n="76">A sign of wet weather to-morrow . Do n't scoff !</l>
     <l n="77">We people who chum with the waves and the wind</l>
     <l n="78">Know more than all wise signal bureaus combined .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="79">But come , let us talk of yourself — for of me</l>
     <l n="80">There is little to tell which your eyes may not see .</l>
     <l n="81">Since we finished at College ( eight years , is it not ? )</l>
     <l n="82">I simply have dreamed away life in this spot .</l>
     <l n="83">With my dogs and my horses , a book and a pen ,</l>
     <l n="84">And a week spent in town as a change now and then .</l>
     <l n="85">Fatigue for the body , disease for the mind ,</l>
     <l n="86">Are all that the city can give me , I find .</l>
     <l n="87">Yet once in a while there is wisdom I hold</l>
     <l n="88">In leaving the things that are dearer than gold ,—</l>
     <l n="89">Loved people and places — if only to learn</l>
     <l n="90">The exquisite rapture it is to return .</l>
     <l n="91">But you , I remember , craved motion and change ;</l>
     <l n="92">You hated the usual , worshiped the strange .</l>
     <l n="93">Adventure and travel I know were your theme :</l>
     <l n="94">Well , how did the real compare with the dream ?</l>
     <l n="95">You have compassed the earth since we parted at Yale ,</l>
     <l n="96">Has life grown the richer , or only grown stale ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="97">Roger :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="98">Stale , stale , my dear boy ! that 's the story in short ,</l>
     <l n="99">I am weary of travel , adventure and sport ;</l>
     <l n="100">At home and abroad , in all climates and lands ,</l>
     <l n="101">I have had what life gives when a full purse commands ,</l>
     <l n="102">I have chased after Pleasure , that phantom faced elf ,</l>
     <l n="103">And lost the best part of my youth and myself .</l>
     <l n="104">And now , barely thirty , I 'm heart sick and blue ;</l>
     <l n="105">Life seems like a farce scarcely worth sitting through .</l>
     <l n="106">I dread its long stretch of dissatisfied years ;</l>
     <l n="107">Ah ! wealth is not always the boon it appears .</l>
     <l n="108">And poverty lights not such ruinous fires</l>
     <l n="109">As gratified appetites , tastes and desires .</l>
     <l n="110">Fate curses , when letting us do as we please —</l>
     <l n="111">It stunts a man 's soul to be cradled in ease .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="112">Maurice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="113">You are right in a measure ; the devil I hold</l>
     <l n="114">Is oftener found in full coffers of gold</l>
     <l n="115">Than in bare , empty larders . The soul , it is plain ,</l>
     <l n="116">Needs the conflicts of earth , needs the stress and the strain</l>
     <l n="117">Of misfortune , to bring out its strength in this life —</l>
     <l n="118">The Soul 's calisthenics are sorrow and strife .</l>
     <l n="119">But , Roger , what folly to stand in youth 's prime</l>
     <l n="120">And talk like a man who could father old Time .</l>
     <l n="121">You have life all before you ; the past ,— let it sleep ;</l>
     <l n="122">Its lessons alone are the things you should keep .</l>
     <l n="123">There is virtue sometimes in our follies and sinnings ;</l>
     <l n="124">Right lives very often have faulty beginnings .</l>
     <l n="125">Results , and not causes , are what we should measure .</l>
     <l n="126">You have learned precious truths in your search after pleasure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="127">You have learned that a glow worm is never a star ,</l>
     <l n="128">You have learned that Peace builds not her temples afar .</l>
     <l n="129">And now , dispossessed of the spirit to roam ,</l>
     <l n="130">You are finely equipped to establish a home .</l>
     <l n="131">That 's the one thing you need to lend savor to life ,</l>
     <l n="132">A home , and the love of a sweet hearted wife ,</l>
     <l n="133">And children to gladden the path to old age .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="134">Roger :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="135">Alas ! from life 's book I have torn out that page ;</l>
     <l n="136">I have loved many times and in many a fashion ,</l>
     <l n="137">Which means I know nothing at all of the passion .</l>
     <l n="138">I have scattered my heart , here and there , bit by bit ,</l>
     <l n="139">‘ Til now there is nothing worth while left of it ;</l>
     <l n="140">And , worse than all else , I have ceased to believe</l>
     <l n="141">In the virtue and truth of the daughters of Eve .</l>
     <l n="142">There 's tragedy for you — when man 's early trust</l>
     <l n="143">In woman , experience hurls to the dust !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="144">Maurice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="145">Then you doubt your own mother ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="146">Roger :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="147">She passed heavenward</l>
     <l n="148">Before I remember ; a saint , I have heard ,</l>
     <l n="149">While she lived ; there are scores of good women to-day ,</l>
     <l n="150">Temptation has chanced not to wander their way .</l>
     <l n="151">The devil has more than his lordship can do ,</l>
     <l n="152">He can n't make the rounds , so some women keep true .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="153">Maurice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="154">You think then each woman , if tempted , must fall ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="155">Roger :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="156">Yes , if tempted her way — not one way suits them all —</l>
     <l n="157">They have tastes in their sins as they have in their clothes ,</l>
     <l n="158">The tempter , of course , has to first study those .</l>
     <l n="159">One needs to be flattered , another is bought ;</l>
     <l n="160">One yields to caresses , by frowns one is caught .</l>
     <l n="161">One wants a bold master , another a slave ,</l>
     <l n="162">With one you must jest , with another be grave .</l>
     <l n="163">But swear you 're a sinner whom she has reformed</l>
     <l n="164">And the average feminine fortress is stormed .</l>
     <l n="165">In rescuing men from abysses of sin</l>
     <l n="166">She loses her head — and herself tumbles in .</l>
     <l n="167">The mind of a woman was shaped for a saint ,</l>
     <l n="168">But deep in her heart lies the devil 's own taint .</l>
     <l n="169">With plans for salvation her busy brain teems ,</l>
     <l n="170">While her heart longs in secret to know how sin seems .</l>
     <l n="171">And if with this question unanswered she dies ,</l>
     <l n="172">Temptation came not in the right sort of guise .</l>
     <l n="173">There 's my estimate , Reese , of the beautiful sex ;</l>
     <l n="174">I see by your face that my words wound and vex ,</l>
     <l n="175">But remember , my boy , I 'm a man of the world .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="176">Maurice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="177">Thank God , in the vortex I have not been hurled .</l>
     <l n="178">If experience breeds such a mental disease ,</l>
     <l n="179">I am glad I have lived with the birds and the bees ,</l>
     <l n="180">And the winds and the waves , and let people alone</l>
     <l n="181">So far in my life but good women I 've known .</l>
     <l n="182">My mother , my sister , a few valued friends —</l>
     <l n="183">A teacher , a schoolmate , and there the list ends .</l>
     <l n="184">But to know one true woman in sunshine and gloom ,</l>
     <l n="185">From the zenith of life to the door of the tomb ,</l>
     <l n="186">To know her , as I knew that mother of mine ,</l>
     <l n="187">Is to know the whole sex and to kneel at the shrine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="188">Roger :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="189">Then you think saint and woman synonymous terms ?</l>

     <l n="190">Maurice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="191">Oh , no ! we are all , men and women , poor worms</l>
     <l n="192">Crawling up from the dampness and darkness of clay</l>
     <l n="193">To bask in the sunlight and warmth of the day .</l>
     <l n="194">Some climb to a leaf and reflect its bright sheen ,</l>
     <l n="195">Some toil through the grass , and are crushed there unseen .</l>
     <l n="196">Some sting if you touch them , and some evolve wings ;</l>
     <l n="197">Yet God dwells in each of the poor , groping things .</l>
     <l n="198">They came from the Source — to the Source they go back ;</l>
     <l n="199">The sinners are those who have missed the true track .</l>
     <l n="200">We can not judge women or men as a class ,</l>
     <l n="201">Each soul has its own distinct place in the mass .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="202">There is no sex in sin ; it were folly to swear</l>
     <l n="203">All women are angels , but worse to declare</l>
     <l n="204">All are devils as you do . You 're morbid , my boy ,</l>
     <l n="205">In what you thought gold you have found much alloy</l>
     <l n="206">And now you are doubting there is the true ore .</l>
     <l n="207">But wait till you study my sweet simple store</l>
     <l n="208">Of pure sterling treasures ; just wait till you 've been</l>
     <l n="209">A few restful weeks , or a season , within</l>
     <l n="210">The charmed circle of home life ; then , Roger , you 'll find</l>
     <l n="211">These malarial mists clearing out of your mind .</l>
     <l n="212">As a ship cuts the fog and is caught by the breeze ,</l>
     <l n="213">And swept through the sunlight to fair , open seas ,</l>
     <l n="214">So your heart will be caught and swept out to the ocean</l>
     <l n="215">Of youth and youth 's birthright of happy emotion .</l>
     <l n="216">I 'll wager my hat ( it was new yesterday )</l>
     <l n="217">That you 'll fall in love , too , in a serious way .</l>
     <l n="218">Our girls at Bay Bend are bewitching and fair ,</l>

      <l n="1473">Roger turned to the world for distraction . The world</l>

      <l n="1482">Yellow rays of the hot August sun touched his bed</l>
      <l n="1483">And proclaimed it was mid-day . He rose , and his head</l>

      <l n="1495">The beach swarmed with bathers — to be more exact ,</l>
      <l n="1496">Swarmed with people in costumes of bathers . In fact ,</l>
      <l n="1497">Many beautiful women bathed but in the light</l>
      <l n="1498">Of men 's eyes ; and their costumes were made for the sight ,</l>
      <l n="1499">Not the sea . From the sea 's lusty outreaching arms</l>
      <l n="1500">They escaped with shrill shrieks , while the men viewed their charms</l>
      <l n="1501">And made mental notes of them . Yet , at this hour ,</l>
      <l n="1502">The waves , too , were swelling sea meadows , a-flower</l>
      <l n="1503">With faces of swimmers . All dressed for his bath ,</l>
      <l n="1504">Roger paused in confusion , because in his path</l>
      <l n="1505">Surged a crowd of the curious ; all eyes were bent</l>
      <l n="1506">On the form of a woman who leisurely went</l>
      <l n="1507">From her bathing house down to the beach . “ There she goes , ”</l>
      <l n="1508">Roger heard a dame cry , as she stepped on his toes</l>
      <l n="1509">With her whole ample weight . “ What , the one with red hair ?</l>
      <l n="1510">Why , she is n't as pretty as Maude , I declare . ”</l>
      <l n="1511">A man passing by with his comrade , cried : “ Ned ,</l>
      <l n="1512">Look ! there is La Travers , the one with the red</l>
      <l n="1513">Braid of hair to her knees . She 's a mystery here ,</l>
      <l n="1514">And at present the topic of talk at the Pier . ”</l>
      <l n="1515">Roger followed their glances in time to behold</l>
      <l n="1516">For a second a head crowned with braids of bright gold ,</l>
      <l n="1517">And a form like a Venus , all costumed in white .</l>
      <l n="1518">Then she plunged through a billow and vanished from sight .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="204">
      <l n="1519">It was half an hour afterward , possibly more ,</l>
      <l n="1520">As Roger swam farther and farther from shore ,</l>
      <l n="1521">With new life in his limbs and new force in his brain ,</l>
      <l n="1522">That he heard , just behind him , a sharp cry of pain .</l>
      <l n="1523">Ten strokes in the rear on the crest of a wave</l>
      <l n="1524">Shone a woman 's white face . “ Keep your courage ; be brave ;</l>
      <l n="1525">I am coming , ” he shouted . “ Turn over and float . ”</l>
      <l n="1526">His strong shoulder plunged like the prow of a boat</l>
      <l n="1527">Through the billows . Six overhand strokes brought him close</l>
      <l n="1528">To the woman , who lay like a wilted white rose</l>
      <l n="1529">On the waves . “ Now , be careful , ” he cried ; “ lay your hand</l>
      <l n="1530">Well up on my shoulder ; my arms , understand ,</l>
      <l n="1531">Must be free ; do not touch them — - please follow my wishes ,</l>
      <l n="1532">Unless you are anxious to fatten the fishes . ”</l>
      <l n="1533">The woman obeyed him . “ You need not fear me , ”</l>
      <l n="1534">She replied , “ I am wholly at home in the sea .</l>
      <l n="1535">I knew all the arts of the swimmer , I thought ,</l>
      <l n="1536">But confess I was frightened when suddenly caught</l>
      <l n="1537">With a cramp in my knee at this distance from shore . ”</l>
      <l n="1538">With slow even breast strokes the strong swimmer bore</l>
      <l n="1539">His fair burden landward . She lay on the billows</l>
      <l n="1540">As lightly as if she were resting on pillows</l>
      <l n="1541">Of down . She relinquished herself to the sea</l>
      <l n="1542">And the man , and was saved ; though God knows both can be</l>
      <l n="1543">False and fickle enough ; yet resistance or strife ,</l>
      <l n="1544">On occasions like this , means the forfeit of life .</l>
      <l n="1545">The throng of the bathers had scattered before</l>
      <l n="1546">Roger carried his burden safe into the shore</l>
      <l n="1547">And saw her emerge from the water , a place</l>
      <l n="1548">Where most women lose every vestige of grace</l>
      <l n="1549">Or of charm . But this mermaid seemed fairer than when</l>
      <l n="1550">She had challenged the glances of women and men</l>
      <l n="1551">As she went to her bath . Now her clinging silk suit</l>
      <l n="1552">Revealed every line , from the throat to the foot ,</l>
      <l n="1553">Of her beautiful form . Her arms , in their splendor ,</l>
      <l n="1554">Gleamed white like wet marble . The round waist was slender ,</l>
      <l n="1555">And yet not too small . From the twin perfect crests</l>
      <l n="1556">And the virginlike grace of her beautiful breasts</l>
      <l n="1557">To the exquisite limbs and the curve of her thigh ,</l>
      <l n="1558">And the arch of her proud little instep , the eye</l>
      <l n="1559">Drank in beauty . Her face was not beautiful ; yet</l>
      <l n="1560">The gaze lingered on it , for Eros had set</l>
      <l n="1561">His seal on her features . The mouth full and weak ,</l>
      <l n="1562">The blue shadow drooping from eyelid to cheek</l>
      <l n="1563">Like a stain of crushed grapes , and the pale , ardent skin ,</l>
      <l n="1564">All spoke of volcanic emotions within .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="205">
      <l n="1565">By her tip tilted nose and low brow , it was plain</l>

      <l n="1567">She had given the chief role of life to her heart ,</l>
      <l n="1568">And her intellect played but a small minor part .</l>
      <l n="1569">Her eyes were the color the sunlight reveals</l>
      <l n="1570">When it pierces the soft , furry coat of young seals .</l>
      <l n="1571">The thickly fringed lids seemed unwilling to rise ,</l>
      <l n="1572">But drooped , half concealing them ; wonderful eyes ,</l>
      <l n="1573">Full of secrets and bodings of sorrow . As coarse</l>
      <l n="1574">And as thick as the mane of a finely groomed horse</l>
      <l n="1575">Was her bright mass of hair . The sea , with rough hands ,</l>
      <l n="1576">Had made free with the braids , and unloosened the strands</l>
      <l n="1577">Till they hung in great clusters of curls to her knees .</l>
      <l n="1578">Her voice , when she spoke , held the breadth and the breeze</l>
      <l n="1579">Of the West in its tones ; and the use of the R</l>
      <l n="1580">Made the listener certain her home had been far</l>
      <l n="1581">From New England . Long after she vanished from view</l>
      <l n="1582">The eye and the ear seemed to sense her anew .</l>
      <l n="1583">There was that in her voice and her presence which hung</l>
      <l n="1584">In the air like a strain of a song which is sung</l>
      <l n="1585">By a singer , and then sings itself the whole day ,</l>

      <l n="1600">The South was the land of fair women , he mused ,</l>
      <l n="1601">Because they were indolent . Women who used</l>
      <l n="1602">Mind or body too freely . Changed curves into angles ,</l>
      <l n="1603">For beauty forever with intellect wrangles .</l>

      <l n="1606">As he mused Roger watched with a keen interest</l>
      <l n="1607">For a sight of his Undine . “ All coiffured and drest ,</l>
      <l n="1608">With her wonderful body concealed , and her hair</l>

      <l n="1610">He soliloquized . “ Ah ! ” the word burst from his lips ,</l>
      <l n="1611">For he saw her approaching . She walked from the hips</l>
      <l n="1612">With an undulous motion . As graceful and free</l>
      <l n="1613">From all effort as waves swinging in from the sea</l>
      <l n="1614">Were her movements . Her full molded figure seemed slight</l>
      <l n="1615">In its close fitting gown of black cloth ; and the white</l>
      <l n="1616">Of her cheek seemed still whiter by contrast . Her clothes</l>
      <l n="1617">Were tasteful and quiet ; yet Roger Montrose</l>
      <l n="1618">Knew in some subtle manner he could not express</l>
      <l n="1619">( ‘ Tis an instinct men have in the matters of dress )</l>
      <l n="1620">That they never were made in New York . By her hat</l>
      <l n="1621">One can oft read a woman 's whole character . That</l>
      <l n="1622">Which our fair Undine wore was a thing of rich lace ,</l>
      <l n="1623">Flowers and ribbons like others one saw in the place .</l>
      <l n="1624">Yet the width of the brim , or the twist of its bows ,</l>
      <l n="1625">Or the way it was worn made it different from those .</l>
      <l n="1626">As it drooped o'er the eyes full of mystery there ,</l>
      <l n="1627">It seemed , all at once , both a menace and dare ;</l>
      <l n="1628">A menace to women , a dare to the men .</l>
      <l n="1629">She bowed as she passed Roger 's table ; and then</l>
      <l n="1630">Took a chair opposite , spread her shade of red silk ,</l>
      <l n="1631">Called a waiter and ordered a cup of hot milk ,</l>
      <l n="1632">Which she leisurely sipped . She seemed unaware</l>
      <l n="1633">Of the curious eyes she attracted . Her air</l>
      <l n="1634">Was of one quite at home , and entirely at ease</l>
      <l n="1635">With herself , the sole person she studied to please .</l>
      <l n="1636">She had been for three weeks at the Pier , and alone ,</l>
      <l n="1637">Without maid or escort , and nothing was known</l>
      <l n="1638">Of her there , save the name which the register bore ,</l>

      <l n="1644">And all men with interest . Roger , blasé ,</l>
      <l n="1645">Disillusioned with life as he was , felt the sway</l>
      <l n="1646">Of her strong personality , there as she sat</l>
      <l n="1647">Looking out ‘ neath the rim of her coquettish hat</l>
      <l n="1648">With dark eyes on the sea . Few people had power</l>
      <l n="1649">To draw his gray thoughts from himself for an hour</l>
      <l n="1650">As this woman had done ; she was food for his mind ,</l>
      <l n="1651">And he sought by his inner perceptions to find</l>
      <l n="1652">in what class she belonged . “ An adventuress ? No ,</l>
      <l n="1653">Though I fancy three-fourths of the women think so</l>
      <l n="1654">And one-half of the men ; but that role leaves a trace ,</l>
      <l n="1655">An expression , I fail to detect in her face .</l>
      <l n="1656">Her past is not shadowed ; my judgment would say</l>
      <l n="1657">That her sins lie before her , and not far away .</l>

      <l n="531">The springtime is here in our old home again ,</l>
      <l n="532">Which again you have left . Oh , most worthy of men ,</l>
      <l n="533">Why grieve for unworthiness ? Why waste your life</l>
      <l n="534">For a woman who never was meant for a wife ?</l>
      <l n="535">Mabel Lee has no love in her nature . Your heart</l>
      <l n="536">Would have starved in her keeping . She plays her new part ,</l>
      <l n="537">As the faithful , forgiving , sweet spouse , with content .</l>
      <l n="538">I think she is secretly glad Roger went</l>
      <l n="539">Astray for a season . She stands up still higher</l>
      <l n="540">On her pedestal , now , for Bay Bend to admire .</l>
      <l n="541">She is pleased with herself . As for Roger , he trots</l>
      <l n="542">Like a lamb in her wake , with the blemishing spots</l>
      <l n="543">Of his sins washed away by the Church . Oh I seem</l>
      <l n="544">To myself , in these days , like one waked from a dream</l>
      <l n="545">To blessed reality . Off in the Bay</l>
      <l n="546">I saw a fair snowy sailed ship yesterday .</l>
      <l n="547">The masts shone like gold , and the furrowed waves laughed ,</l>
      <l n="548">To be beat into foam by the beautiful craft .</l>
      <l n="549">But close in the harbor I saw the ship lying ;</l>
      <l n="550">What seemed like the wings of a sea gull when flying ,</l>
      <l n="551">Were weather stained sheets ; there were no masts of gold ,</l>
      <l n="552">And the craft was uncleanly , unseaworthy , old .</l>
      <l n="553">Well , the man whom I loved , and loved vainly , and whom</l>
      <l n="554">I fancied had shadowed my whole life with gloom ,</l>
      <l n="555">Has been shown to my sight like that ship in the Bay ,</l>
      <l n="556">And all my illusions have vanished away .</l>
      <l n="557">The man is by nature weak , selfish , unstable .</l>
      <l n="558">I think if some woman more loving than Mabel ,</l>
      <l n="559">More tender , more tactful , less painfully good ,</l>
      <l n="560">Had directed his home-life , perchance Roger would</l>
      <l n="561">Have evolved his best self , that pure atom of God ,</l>
      <l n="562">Which lies deep in each heart like a seed in the sod .</l>
      <l n="563">‘ Tis the world 's over-virtuous women , ofttimes ,</l>
      <l n="564">Who drive men of weak will into sexual crimes .</l>
      <l n="565">I pity him . ( God knows I pity , each , all</l>
      <l n="566">Of the poor striving souls who grope blindly and fall</l>
      <l n="567">By the wayside of life . ) But the love which unbidden</l>
      <l n="568">Crept into my heart , and was guarded and hidden</l>
      <l n="569">For years , that has vanished . It passed like a breath ,</l>
      <l n="570">In the gray Autumn morning when Roger faced death ,</l>
      <l n="571">As he thought , and uncovered his heart to my sight .</l>
      <l n="572">Like a corpse , resurrected and brought to the light ,</l>
      <l n="573">Which crumbles to ashes , the love of my youth</l>
      <l n="574">Crumbled off into nothingness . Ah , it is truth ;</l>
      <l n="575">Love can die ! You may hold it is not the true thing ,</l>
      <l n="576">Not the genuine passion , which dies or takes wing ;</l>
      <l n="577">But the soil of the heart , like the soil of the earth ,</l>
      <l n="578">May , at varying times of the seasons , give birth</l>
      <l n="579">To bluebells , and roses , and bright goldenrod .</l>
      <l n="580">Each one is a gift from the garden of God ,</l>
      <l n="581">Though it dies when its season is over . Why cling</l>
      <l n="582">To the withered dead stalk of the blossoms of spring</l>
      <l n="583">Through a lifetime , Maurice ? It is stubbornness only ,</l>
      <l n="584">Not constancy , which makes full many lives lonely .</l>
      <l n="585">They want their own way , and , like cross children , fling</l>
      <l n="586">Back the gifts which , in place of the lost flowers of spring ,</l>
      <l n="587">Fate offers them . Life holds in store for you yet</l>
      <l n="588">Better things , dear Maurice , than a dead violet ,</l>
      <l n="589">As it holds better things than dead daisies for me .</l>
      <l n="590">To Roger Montrose , let us leave Mabel Lee ,</l>
      <l n="591">With our blessing . They seem to be happy ; or she</l>

      <l n="597">He has time now to worship his God and his wife .</l>
