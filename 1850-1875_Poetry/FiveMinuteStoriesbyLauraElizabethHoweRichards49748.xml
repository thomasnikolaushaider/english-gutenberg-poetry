    <docTitle><titlePart>FIVE MINUTE STORIES . BETTY . WHEN I sit and hold her little hand , My Betty , Then all the little troubles seem to shrink , Grow small and petty . It does not matter any more That ink is spilt on parlor floor , That gown is caught upon the latch , And not the smallest bit to match , That cook is going , housemaid gone , And coming guests to meet alone ; It matters not at all , you see , For I have Betty , and Betty has me . When I sit and hold her little hand , My Betty , Then all the simple , foolish baby talk Grows wise and witty . I ’ m glad to know that Pussy Mow Was frightened at the wooden cow , I weep for Dolly ’ s broken head , And for the sawdust she has shed ; I take with joy the cups of tea From wooden teapot poured for me , And all goes well , because , you see , I play with Betty , and Betty with me . When I walk and hold her little hand , My Betty , Then every humble weed beside the way Grows proud and pretty . The clover never was so red , Their purest white the daisies spread , The buttercups begin to dance , The reeds salute with lifted lance , The very tallest trees we pass Bend down to greet my little lass ; And these things make my joy , you see , For I love Betty , and Betty loves me ! TWO CALLS . BEAU PHILIP and Beau Bobby stood side by side on the doorstep of their father ’ s house . They were brothers , though you would hardly have thought it , for one was very big and one was very little . Beau Philip was tall and slender , with handsome dark eyes , and a silky brown moustache which he was fond of curling at the ends . He wore a well-fitting overcoat , and a tall hat and pearl-gray kid gloves . Beau Bobby was short and chubby , and ten years old , with blue eyes and yellow curls ( not long ones , but funny little croppy locks that would curl , no matter how short he kept them ) . He wore a pea-jacket , and red leggings and red mittens . There was one thing , however , about the two brothers that was just the same . Each carried in his hand a great red rose , lovely and fragrant , with crimson leaves and a golden heart . “ Where are you going with your rose , Beau Bobby ?” asked Beau Philip . “ I am going to make a New Year ’ s call ,” replied Beau Bobby . “ So am I ,” said Beau Philip , laughing . “ We may meet again . Good-by , little Beau !” “ Good-by , big Beau !” said Bobby , seriously , and they walked off in different directions . Beau Philip went to call on a beautiful young lady , to whom he wished to give his rose ; but so many other people were calling on her at the same time that he could only say “ good-morning !” to her , and then stand in a corner , pulling his moustache and wishing that the others would go . There were so many roses in the room , bowls and vases and jars of them , that he thought she would not care for his single blossom , so he put it in his buttonhole ; but it gave him no pleasure whatever . Beau Bobby trotted away on his short legs till he came to a poor street , full of tumble-down cottages . He stopped before one of them and knocked at the door . It was opened by a motherly looking Irish woman , who looked as if she had just left the washtub , as , indeed , she had . “ Save us !” she cried , “ is it yersilf , Master Bobby ? Come in , me jewel , and warm yersilf by the fire ! It ’ s mortal cowld the day .” “ Oh , I ’ m not cold , thank you !” said Bobby . “ But I will come in . Would you — would you like a rose , Mrs. Flanagan ? I have brought this rose for you . And I wish you a Happy New Year . And thank you for washing my shirts so nicely .” This was a long speech for Beau Bobby , who was apt to be rather silent ; but it had a wonderful effect on Mrs. Flanagan . She grew very red as she took the rose , and the tears came into her eyes . “ Ye little angil !” she said , wiping her eyes with her apron . “ Look at the lovely rose ! For me , is it ? And who sint ye wid it , honey ?” “ Nobody !” said Bobby . “ I brought it myself . It was my rose . You see ,” he said , drawing his stool up to the little stove , “ I heard you say , yesterday , Mrs. Flanagan , when you brought my shirts home , that you had never had a New Year ’ s call in your life ; so I thought I would make you one to-day , you see . Happy New Year !” “ Happy New Year to yersilf , me sweet jewel !” cried good Mrs. Flanagan . “ And blessings go wid every day of it , for your kind heart and your sweet face . I had a sore spot in my heart this day , Master Bobby , bein ’ so far from my own people ; but it ’ s you have taken it away this minute , wid yer sweet rose and yer bright smile . See now , till I put it in my best chiny taypot . Ain ’ t that lovely , now ?” “ Isn ’ t it !” cried Beau Bobby . “ And it makes the whole room sweet . I am enjoying my call very much , Mrs. Flanagan ; aren ’ t you ?” “ That I am !” said Mrs. Flanagan . “ With all my heart !” A NEW YEAR SONG . When the year is new , my dear , When the year is new , Let us make a promise here , Little I and you , Not to fall a-quarrelling Over every tiny thing , But sing and smile , smile and sing , All the glad year through . As the year goes by , my dear , As the year goes by , Let us keep our sky swept clear , Little you and I . Sweep up every cloudy scowl , Every little thunder-growl , And live and laugh , laugh and live , ’ Neath a cloudless sky . When the year is old , my dear , When the year is old , Let us never doubt or fear , Though the days grow cold . Loving thoughts are always warm ; Merry hearts know ne ’ er a storm . Come ice and snow , so love ’ s dear glow Turn all our gray to gold . NEW YEAR . THE little sweet Child tied on her hood , and put on her warm cloak and mittens . “ I am going to the wood ,” she said , “ to tell the creatures all about it . They cannot understand about Christmas , mamma says , and of course she knows , but I do think they ought to know about New Year !” Out in the wood the snow lay light and powdery on the branches , but under foot it made a firm , smooth floor , over which the Child could walk lightly without sinking in . She saw other footprints beside her own , tiny bird-tracks , little hopping marks , which showed where a rabbit had taken his way , traces of mice and squirrels and other little wild-wood beasts . The Child stood under a great hemlock-tree , and looked up toward the clear blue sky , which shone far away beyond the dark tree-tops . She spread her hands abroad and called , “ Happy New Year ! Happy New Year to everybody in the wood , and all over the world !” A rustling was heard in the hemlock branches , and a striped squirrel peeped down at her . “ What do you mean by that , little Child ?” he asked . And then from all around came other squirrels , came little field-mice , and hares swiftly leaping , and all the winter birds , titmouse and snow-bird , and many another ; and they all wanted to know what the Child meant by her greeting , for they had never heard the words before . “ It means that God is giving us another year !” said the Child . “ Four more seasons , each lovelier than the last , just as it was last year . Flowers will bud , and then they will blossom , and then the fruit will hang all red and golden on the branches , for birds and men and little children to eat .” “ And squirrels , too !” cried the chipmunk , eagerly .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>“ Of course !” said the Child . “ Squirrels , too , and every creature that lives in the good green wood . And this is not all ! We can do over again the things that we tried to do last year , and perhaps failed in doing . We have another chance to be good and kind , to do little loving things that help , and to cure ourselves of doing naughty things . Our hearts can have lovely new seasons , like the flowers and trees and all the sweet things that grow and bear leaves and fruit . I thought I would come and tell you all this , because sometimes one does not think of things till one hears them from another ’ s lips . Are you glad I came ? If you are glad , say Happy New Year ! each in his own way ! I say it to you all now in my way . Happy New Year ! Happy New Year !”</p>
     <p>Such a noise as broke out then had never been heard in the wood since the oldest hemlock was a baby , and that was a long time ago . Chirping , twittering , squeaking , chattering ! The wood-doves lit on the Child ’ s shoulder and cooed in her ear , and she knew just what they said . The squirrels made a long speech , and meant every word of it , which is more than people always do ; the field-mouse said that she was going to turn over a new leaf , the very biggest cabbage-leaf she could find ; while the titmouse invited the whole company to dine with him , a thing he had never done in his life before .</p>
     <p>When the Child turned to leave the wood , the joyful chorus followed her , and she went , smiling , home and told her mother all about it . “ And , mother ,” she said , “ I should not be surprised if they had got a little bit of Christmas , after all , along with their New Year !”</p>

      <head>THE RUBBER BABY .</head>
       <l n="1">THE ascent of the Rubber Baby took place in the back yard on the</l>
       <l n="2">afternoon of last Fourth of July . It was an occasion of great interest .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>We were all in the yard ,— Mamma , Papa , Tubby , Toots , Posy , Bunny , Bay and Mr. Bagabave . ( This boy has another name , but he prefers Mr. Bagabave because he made it himself . )</p>
     <p>There was also the best cousin , who is nine feet tall , more or less , and a kind gentleman who was a friend of the best cousin , and came to see that he did not hurt himself with the firecrackers .</p>
     <p>Well , there we all were , and we fired crackers and torpedoes the whole afternoon without stopping . The best cousin and the kind gentleman did it to amuse the children , and the rest of us did it to amuse ourselves .</p>
     <p>We had cannon-crackers a foot long ; we had double-headers , which papa threw up in the air , oh , ever so far , so that they exploded long before they reached the ground . Then there were dear little crackers , very small and slender , just made for Bay , though it is quite strange that the Chinese people should have known about her , when she is so very young .</p>
     <p>Now we fired off single crackers , great and small , with a bang and a bang and a bang-bang ; then we put a whole bunch under a barrel , and they went snap , crack , crickety , crackety . Yes , it was delightful .</p>
     <p>But Papa , who has lived long and fired many crackers , began to pine for something new , and he said , “ Let us have an ascension !”</p>
     <p>Then we took counsel , and Mr. Bagabave said , “ We will send up the Rubber Baby .” Now the Rubber Baby belonged to Bay , and she loved him ; but when Bunny and Mr. Bagabave told her what a fine thing it was to get up in the world , and how many people would like to go up farther than the Rubber Baby would go , Bay consented , and went and brought the Rubber Baby , who smiled and thought little of the matter .</p>
     <p>Then Papa brought the biggest cannon-cracker of all , and made a long fuse for it , and set it up in the ground ; and over it he put a tomato can , and on the tomato can he set the Rubber Baby .</p>
     <p>Now all was ready , and we all stood waiting for the final moment . I do not know what were the thoughts of the Rubber Baby at this moment , but we were all in a state of great excitement .</p>
     <p>“ Get out of the way , children !” cried Papa . “ Run away , Bay ! Get behind the maple-tree , Mr. Bagabave ! She ’ s going . Now , then ! One , two , three , and away !” and Papa touched off the fuse .</p>
     <p>A moment of great suspense , a tremendous report , a dense cloud of smoke . Up soared the Rubber Baby , higher than the top of the big maple-tree , almost to the very clouds ( or so Bay thought ) .</p>
     <p>We watched in silent rapture ; then , as the intrepid air-traveller came down , still smiling , a loud cheer broke from the whole crowd .</p>
     <p>No , not from the whole crowd ; there was one exception . The kind gentleman who came to keep the best cousin from hurting himself gave a howl so loud and clear that we all started , and ran to see what was the matter .</p>
     <p>The poor gentleman had been holding a cannon-cracker , which he was going to fire just when Papa gave the signal for sending off the Rubber Baby . In the excitement of the moment he forgot the cannon-cracker , and it went off in his hand , and burnt him quite badly .</p>
     <p>We were all very sorry , not only for the poor gentleman ’ s own sake , but because now there was no one to see that the best cousin did not hurt himself .</p>
     <p>A pretty young lady came , and tied up the poor gentleman ’ s hand so nicely with her soft handkerchief that he said he was glad the cracker had gone off in it .</p>
     <p>The Rubber Baby said nothing , but sat still in the middle of the gravel walk . Perhaps it was waiting to see if some lovely young lady would come to cheer and comfort it ; but no one came till little Bay took it up , wiped off the dust and powder , kissed it , and put it to bed .</p>
     <p>THE RED , WHITE AND BLUE .</p>
     <p>DOROTHY was all dressed to see the Fourth of July procession . She had on her white dress , her blue sash , and her red shoes . Her cheeks were red , too , and her eyes were blue , and when she pushed up her full muslin sleeves , she saw how white her fat little arms were as soon as you got past the sunburn . “ I ’ se red , white and blue mine-self !” said Dorothy .</p>
     <p>She went and stood on the top doorstep , which was very near the street . Pretty soon the trumpets began to sound and the drums to beat , first far away , then nearer and nearer . At last the procession came round the corner . First the drum-major , with his huge bearskin cap , tossing his great gilded stick about ; then came the musicians , puffing away with might and main at their great brass horns and trumpets , and banging away at their drums and kettle-drums . It was a splendid noise ; but they were really playing a tune , the “ Red , White and Blue .”</p>
     <p>The standard-bearer dipped his flag as he passed Dorothy ’ s house , for there was a great flag draped over the doorway , and red , white and blue streamers running up to the windows , and Dorothy waved a little flag as she stood on the top doorstep . “ Three cheers for the red , white and blue !” sang the soldiers as they marched by .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Sank you !” said Dorothy , spreading out her frock and patting her sash .</l>
       <l n="2">“ I ’ se the red , white and blue ! See mine sash !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">The soldiers laughed and cheered .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">Then came a soldier who looked straight up at Dorothy , and held out his</l>
       <l n="5">arms , though without stopping . And it was Dorothy ’ s own Papa !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="6">In less than half a minute Dorothy was in his arms , and he had caught</l>
       <l n="7">her up , and put her on his shoulder .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Dorothy waved her flag , and jumped up and down on Papa ’ s shoulder , and cried , “ Three cheers for the red , white and blue ! three cheers for me !” and all the soldiers shouted and cheered and laughed , and so Dorothy and the procession went on their way all through the village .</p>

      <head>TOTTY ’ S CHRISTMAS .</head>
       <l n="1">THEY call me Totty , because I am small . I had a funny Christmas , and</l>
       <l n="2">Mamma said I might tell about it .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I have the scarlet fever , and I live all alone with my Mamma in her room . Nobody comes in ’ cept the doctor , and he says he sha ’ n ’ t come any more to see a girl who feels as well as I do .</p>
     <p>Mamma wears a cap and an apron , and we have our own dishes , just like play , and she washes them in a bright tin pan , and then I have the pan for a drum , and beat on it till she says she shall fly .</p>
     <p>I always stop then , for I do think I should be frightened to see Mamma fly . Besides , she might fly away .</p>
     <p>Well , yesterday was Christmas , and I could get out of bed and sit up in a chair ; it was the first time .</p>
     <p>So I sat up to dinner , and it was a partridge , but we played it was a turkey . There was jelly and macaroni , and for desert we had grapes and oranges . Mamma made it all look pretty , and Papa gave her roses through the door , and she put them all over the table .</p>
     <p>When she had washed the dishes , she turned the big chair round so that I could look out of the window , and Hal and John came out on the lawn and made a snow-man for me to look at .</p>
     <p>It was a fine man , with two legs and two arms , and they kept playing he was the British , and knocking his head off .</p>
     <p>Mamma told me I mustn ’ t turn round till she said I might , but I didn ’ t want to , anyhow , the man was so funny .</p>
     <p>I heard Papa whispering at the door , and I did want to see him , but I knew I couldn ’ t , ’ cause the other children haven ’ t had the fever : and then I heard things rustle , paper and something soft , like brushing clothes .</p>
     <p>They went on rustling , oh , a long time ! and there was jingling , too , and I began to want to turn round very much indeed ; but I didn ’ t , of course , ’ cause I said I wouldn ’ t .</p>
     <p>At last Mamma came up softly and tied something over my eyes , and told me to wait just a minute ; and it really did not seem as if I could .</p>
     <p>Then she turned the chair round , and took the thing off my eyes , and — what do you think was there ?</p>
     <p>A Christmas tree ! A dear little ducky tree , just about as big as I am , and all lighted with red and blue candles , and silver stuff hanging like fringe from the branches , and real icicles . ( No ! Mamma says they are glass , but they look real . They are in a box now , and I can play with them . )</p>
     <p>And everything on the tree was for me . That makes a rhyme . I often make them .</p>
     <p>There was a lovely doll , all china , with clothes to take off and put on , and buttons and buttonholes in everything . I have named her Christine , because that is the most like Christmas of any name I know .</p>
     <p>And a tin horse and cart , and a box of blocks , and a lovely white china slate to draw on , and a box of beasts , not painted , all carved , just like real beasts , and a magnet-box , with three ducks and two swans and four goldfish and a little boat , all made of tin , and lots of oranges and a lovely china box full of cream candy ( the doctor said I might have it if Aunt May made it , and she did ) , and a box of guava jelly , and a little angel at the top , flying , all of white china .</p>
     <p>And everything will wash except the things to eat , ’ cause everything I play with has to be burned up , unless it can be washed , so they all gave me washing things .</p>
     <p>Even Christine has china hair , and all her clothes are white , so they can be boiled , and so can she , and Mamma says it won ’ t hurt her at all .</p>
     <p>So I never had a nicer Christmas , though , of course , I wanted the other children ; but then , I had Mamma , and of course they wanted her , poor dears !</p>
     <p>And nobody need be afraid to read this story , ’ cause it is going to be baked in the oven before it is printed .</p>

      <head>THE NEW SISTER .</head>
       <l n="1">“ LOOK carefully !” said the kind Nurse , turning down a corner of the</l>
       <l n="2">flannel blanket . “ Don ’ t touch her , dears , but just look .”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The children stood on tiptoe and peeped into the tiny red face . They were frightened at first , the baby was so very small , but Johnny took courage in a moment .</p>
     <p>“ Hasn ’ t she got any eyes ?” he asked . “ Or is she like kittens ?”</p>
     <p>“ Yes ; she has eyes , and very bright ones , but she is fast asleep now .”</p>
     <p>“ Look at her little hands !” whispered Lily . “ Aren ’ t they lovely ? Oh , I do wish I could give her a hug !”</p>
     <p>“ Not yet ,” said Nurse . “ She is too tender to be hugged . But Mamma sends word that you may give her something ,— a name . She wants you and Johnny to choose the baby ’ s name , only it must not be either Jemima , Keziah or Keren-Happuch .”</p>
     <p>The Nurse went back into Mamma ’ s room , and left Johnny and Lily staring at each other , too proud and happy to speak at first .</p>
     <p>“ Let ’ s sit right down on the floor and think !” said John . So down they sat .</p>
     <p>“ I think Claribel is a lovely name !” said Lily , after a pause . “ Don ’ t you ?”</p>
     <p>“ No !” replied Johnny , “ it ’ s too girly .”</p>
     <p>“ But baby is a girl !”</p>
     <p>“ I don ’ t care . She needn ’ t have such a very girly name . How do you like Ellen ?”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , Johnny ! why , everybody ’ s named Ellen . We don ’ t want her to be just like everybody . Now Seraphina is not common .”</p>
     <p>“ I should hope not . I should need a mouth a yard wide to say it . What do you think of Bessie ?”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , Bessie is very well , only — well , I should be always thinking of Bessie Jones , and you know she isn ’ t very nice . I ’ ll tell you what , Johnny ! suppose we call her Vesta Geneva , after the girl Papa told us about yesterday .”</p>
     <p>“ Lily , you are a perfect silly ! Why , I wouldn ’ t be seen with a sister called that ! I think Polly is a nice , jolly kind of name .”</p>
     <p>“ Well , I don ’ t .”</p>

     <p>“ Much I care , silly Lily !”</p>
     <p>“ Well !” said Nurse , coming in again , “ what is the name to be , dears ? Mamma is anxious to know .”</p>
     <p>Two heads hung very low , and two pairs of eyes sought the floor and stayed there . “ Shall I tell you ,” the good Nurse went on , taking no notice , “ what I thought would be a very good name for baby ?”</p>
     <p>“ Oh yes ! yes ! do tell us , ’ cause we can ’ t get the right one .”</p>
     <p>“ Well , I thought your mother ’ s name , Mary , would be the very best name in the world . What do you think ?”</p>
     <p>“ Why , of course it would ! We never thought of that . Oh , thank you , Nurse !” cried both voices , joyously . “ Dear Nurse ! will you tell Mamma , please ?”</p>
     <p>Nurse nodded , and went away smiling , and Lily and John looked sheepishly at each other .</p>

      <head>BUTTERCUP GOLD .</head>
      <head>OH ! the cupperty-buts ! and oh ! the cupperty-buts ! out in the meadow , shining under the trees , and sparkling over the lawn , millions and millions of them , each one a bit of purest gold from Mother Nature ’ s mint . Jessy stood at the window , looking out at them , and thinking , as she often had thought before , that there were no flowers so beautiful . “ Cupperty-buts ,” she had been used to call them , when she was a wee baby-girl and could not speak without tumbling over her words and mixing them up in the queerest fashion ; and now that she was a very great girl , actually six years old , they were still cupperty-buts to her , and would never be anything else , she said . There was nothing she liked better than to watch the lovely golden things , and nod to them as they nodded to her ; but this morning her little face looked anxious and troubled , and she gazed at the flowers with an intent and inquiring look , as if she had expected them to reply to her unspoken thoughts . What these thoughts were I am going to tell you .</head>
       <l n="1">Half an hour before , she had called to her mother , who was just going</l>
       <l n="2">out , and begged her to come and look at the cupperty-buts .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ They are brighter than ever , Mamma ! Do just come and look at them ! golden , golden , golden ! There must be fifteen thousand million dollars ’ worth of gold just on the lawn , I should think .”</p>
     <p>And her mother , pausing to look out , said , very sadly ,—</p>
     <p>“ Ah , my darling ! if I only had this day a little of that gold , what a happy woman I should be !”</p>
     <p>And then the good mother went out , and there little Jessy stood , gazing at the flowers , and repeating the words to herself , over and over again ,—</p>
     <p>“ If I only had a little of that gold !”</p>
     <p>She knew that her mother was very , very poor , and had to go out to work every day to earn food and clothes for herself and her little daughter ; and the child ’ s tender heart ached to think of the sadness in the dear mother ’ s look and tone . Suddenly Jessy started , and the sunshine flashed into her face .</p>
     <p>“ Why !” she exclaimed , “ why shouldn ’ t I get some of the gold from the cupperty-buts ? I believe I could get some , perfectly well . When Mamma wants to get the juice out of anything , meat , or fruit , or anything of that sort , she just boils it . And so , if I should boil the cupperty-buts , wouldn ’ t all the gold come out ? Of course it would ! Oh , joy ! how pleased Mamma will be !”</p>
     <p>Jessy ’ s actions always followed her thoughts with great rapidity . In five minutes she was out on the lawn , with a huge basket beside her , pulling away at the buttercups with might and main . Oh ! how small they were , and how long it took even to cover the bottom of the basket . But Jessy worked with a will , and at the end of an hour she had picked enough to make at least a thousand dollars , as she calculated . That would do for one day , she thought ; and now for the grand experiment ! Before going out she had with much labor filled the great kettle with water , so now the water was boiling , and she had only to put the buttercups in and put the cover on . When this was done , she sat as patiently as she could , trying to pay attention to her knitting , and not to look at the clock oftener than every two minutes .</p>
     <p>“ They must boil for an hour ,” she said ; “ and by that time all the gold will have come out .”</p>

       <l n="1">[ Illustration ]</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Well , the hour did pass , somehow or other , though it was a very long one ; and at eleven o ’ clock , Jessy , with a mighty effort , lifted the kettle from the stove and carried it to the open door , that the fresh air might cool the boiling water . At first , when she lifted the cover , such a cloud of steam came out that she could see nothing ; but in a moment the wind blew the steam aside , and then she saw ,— oh , poor little Jessy !— she saw a mass of weeds floating about in a quantity of dirty , greenish water , and that was all . Not the smallest trace of gold , even in the buttercups themselves , was to be seen . Poor little Jessy ! she tried hard not to cry , but it was a bitter disappointment ; the tears came rolling down her cheeks faster and faster , till at length she sat down by the kettle , and , burying her face in her apron , sobbed as if her heart would break .</p>
     <p>Presently , through her sobs , she heard a kind voice saying , “ What is the matter , little one ? Why do you cry so bitterly ?” She looked up and saw an old gentleman with white hair and a bright , cheery face , standing by her . At first , Jessy could say nothing but “ Oh ! the cupperty-buts ! oh ! the cupperty-buts !” but , of course , the old gentleman didn ’ t know what she meant by that , so , as he urged her to tell him about her trouble , she dried her eyes , and told him the melancholy little story : how her mother was very poor , and said she wished she had some gold ; and how she herself had tried to get the gold out of the buttercups by boiling them . “ I was so sure I could get it out ,” she said , “ and I thought Mamma would be so pleased ! And now —”</p>
     <p>Here she was very near breaking down again ; but the gentleman patted her head and said , cheerfully , “ Wait a bit , little woman ! Don ’ t give up the ship yet . You know that gold is heavy , very heavy indeed , and if there were any it would be at the very bottom of the kettle , all covered with the weeds , so that you could not see it . I should not be at all surprised if you found some , after all . Run into the house and bring me a spoon with a long handle , and we will fish in the kettle , and see what we can find .”</p>
     <p>Jessy ’ s face brightened , and she ran into the house . If any one had been standing near just at that moment , I think it is possible that he might have seen the old gentleman ’ s hand go into his pocket and out again very quickly , and might have heard a little splash in the kettle ; but nobody was near , so , of course , I cannot say anything about it . At any rate , when Jessy came out with the spoon , he was standing with both hands in his pockets , looking in the opposite direction . He took the great iron spoon and fished about in the kettle for some time . At last there was a little clinking noise , and the old gentleman lifted the spoon . Oh , wonder and delight ! In it lay three great , broad , shining pieces of gold ! Jessy could hardly believe her eyes . She stared and stared ; and when the old gentleman put the gold into her hand , she still stood as if in a happy dream , gazing at it . Suddenly she started , and remembered that she had not thanked her kindly helper . She looked up , and began , “ Thank you , sir ;” but the old gentleman was gone .</p>
     <p>Well , the next question was , How could Jessy possibly wait till twelve o ’ clock for her mother to come home ? Knitting was out of the question . She could do nothing but dance and look out of window , and look out of window and dance , holding the precious coins tight in her hand . At last , a well-known footstep was heard outside the door , and Mrs. Gray came in , looking very tired and worn . She smiled , however , when she saw Jessy , and said ,—</p>
     <p>“ Well , my darling , I am glad to see you looking so bright . How has the morning gone with my little housekeeper ?”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , mother !” cried Jessy , hopping about on one foot , “ it has gone very well ! oh , very , very , very well ! Oh , my mother dear , what do you think I have got in my hand ? What do you think ? oh , what do you think ?” and she went dancing round and round , till poor Mrs. Gray was quite dizzy with watching her . At last she stopped , and holding out her hand , opened it and showed her mother what was in it . Mrs. Gray was really frightened .</p>
     <p>“ Jessy , my child !” she cried , “ where did you get all that money ?”</p>
     <p>“ Out of the cupperty-buts , Mamma !” said Jessy , “ out of the cupperty-buts ! and it ’ s all for you , every bit of it ! Dear Mamma , now you will be happy , will you not ?”</p>
     <p>“ Jessy ,” said Mrs. Gray , “ have you lost your senses , or are you playing some trick on me ? Tell me all about this at once , dear child , and don ’ t talk nonsense .”</p>
     <p>“ But it isn ’ t nonsense , Mamma !” cried Jessy , “ and it did come out of the cupperty-buts !”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">And then she told her mother the whole story . The tears came into Mrs .</l>
       <l n="2">Gray ’ s eyes , but they were tears of joy and gratitude .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Jessy dear ,” she said , “ when we say our prayers at night , let us never forget to pray for that good gentleman . May Heaven bless him and reward him ! for if it had not been for him , Jessy dear , I fear you would never have found the ‘ Buttercup Gold .’”</p>

     <p>THE STOVE .</p>
     <p>BETTY has a real stove , just as real as the one in the kitchen , if it is not quite so big . It has pots and kettles and a frying-pan , and a soup-pot , and the oven bakes beautifully , and it is just lovely ! I went to spend the afternoon with her yesterday , and we cooked all the time , except when we were eating . First , we made soup in the soup-pot , with some pieces of cold goose , and we took some to Auntie ( she is Betty ’ s mother ) , and she said it was de-licious , and took two cups of it . ( They were doll ’ s cups ; Betty says I ought to put that in , but I don ’ t see any need . ) Then we made scrambled egg and porridge , and baked some custard in the oven , and it was just exactly like a big custard in the big cups at home . The cake was queer , so I won ’ t stop to tell about that , though Rover ate most of it , and the rest we crumbled up for the pigeons , so it wasn ’ t wasted ; but the best of all was the griddle-cakes . Oh , they were splendid ! The griddle is just the right size for one , so they were as round as pennies , and about the same size ; and we had maple syrup on them , and Maggie the cook said she was so jealous ( she called it “ jellies ”) that she should go straight back to Ireland ; but I don ’ t believe she will . I don ’ t feel very well to-day , and Betty wasn ’ t at school , either . But I don ’ t think it had anything to do with the griddle-cakes , and I am going to play with Betty again to-morrow ,— if Mamma will let me .</p>

     <p>WHAT WAS HER NAME ?</p>
     <p>“ WAKE up !” said an old gentleman , dressed in brown and white , as he gently shook the shoulder of a young lady in green , who was lying sound asleep under the trees . “ Wake up , ma ’ am ! it is your watch now , and time for me to take myself off .”</p>
     <p>The young lady stirred a very little , and opened one of her eyes the least little bit . “ Who are you ?” she said , drowsily . “ What is your name ?”</p>
     <p>“ My name is Winter ,” replied the old man . “ What is yours ?”</p>
     <p>“ I have not the faintest idea ,” said the lady , closing her eyes again .</p>
     <p>“ Humph !” growled the old man , “ a pretty person you are to take my place ! Well , good-day , Madam Sleepyhead , and good luck to you !”</p>
     <p>And off he stumped over the dead leaves , which crackled and rustled beneath his feet .</p>
     <p>As soon as he was gone , the young lady in green opened her eyes in good earnest and looked about her .</p>
     <p>“ Madam Sleepyhead , indeed !” she re-echoed , indignantly . “ I am sure that is not my name , anyhow . The question is , What is it ?”</p>
     <p>She looked about her again , but nothing was to be seen save the bare branches of the trees , and the dead , brown leaves and dry moss underfoot .</p>
     <p>“ Trees , do you happen to know what my name is ?” she asked .</p>
     <p>The trees shook their heads . “ No , ma ’ am ,” they said , “ we do not know ; but perhaps when the Wind comes , he will be able to give you some information .”</p>
     <p>The girl shivered a little , and drew her green mantle about her and waited .</p>
     <p>By and by the Wind came blustering along . He caught the trees by their branches , and shook them in rough , though friendly greeting .</p>
     <p>“ Well , boys !” he shouted , “ Old Winter is gone , is he ? I wish you joy of his departure ! But where is the lady who was coming to take his place ?”</p>
     <p>“ She is here ,” answered the trees , “ sitting on the ground ; but she does not know her own name , which seems to trouble her .”</p>
     <p>“ Ho ! ho !” roared the Wind . “ Not know her own name ? That is news , indeed ! And here she has been sleeping , while all the world has been looking for her , and calling her , and wondering where upon earth she was . Come , young lady ,” he added , addressing the girl with rough courtesy , “ I will show you the way to your dressing-room , which has been ready and waiting for you for a fortnight and more .”</p>
     <p>So he led the way through the forest , and the girl followed , rubbing her pretty , sleepy eyes , and dragging her mantle behind her .</p>
     <p>Now it was a very singular thing that whatever the green mantle touched , instantly turned green itself . The brown moss put out little tufts of emerald velvet , fresh shoots came pushing up from the dead , dry grass , and even the shrubs and twigs against which the edges of the garment brushed broke out with tiny swelling buds , all ready to open into leaves .</p>
     <p>By and by the Wind paused and pushed aside the branches , which made a close screen before him .</p>
     <p>“ Here is your dressing-room , young madam ,” he said , with a low bow ; “ be pleased to enter it , and you will find all things in readiness . But let me entreat you to make your toilet speedily , for all the world is waiting for you .”</p>
     <p>Greatly wondering , the young girl passed through the screen of branches , and found herself in a most marvellous place .</p>
     <p>The ground was carpeted with pine-needles , soft and thick and brown . The pine-trees made a dense green wall around , and as the wind passed softly through the boughs , the air was sweet with their spicy fragrance . On the ground were piled great heaps of buds , all ready to blossom ; violets , anemones , hepaticas , blood-root , while from under a huge pile of brown leaves peeped the pale pink buds of the Mayflower .</p>
     <p>The young girl in the green mantle looked wonderingly at all these things . “ How strange !” she said . “ They are all asleep , and waiting for some one to waken them . Perhaps if I do it , they will tell me in return what my name is .”</p>
     <p>She shook the buds lightly , and lo ! every blossom opened its eyes and raised its head , and said , “ Welcome , gracious lady ! welcome ! We have looked for you long , long !”</p>
     <p>The young girl , in delight , took the lovely blossoms , rosy and purple , golden and white , and twined them in her fair locks , and hung them in garlands round her white neck ; and still they were opening by thousands , till the pine-tree hollow was filled with them .</p>
     <p>Presently the girl spied a beautiful carved casket , which had been hidden under a pile of spicy leaves , and from inside of it came a rustling sound , the softest sound that was ever heard .</p>
     <p>She lifted the lid , and out flew a cloud of butterflies .</p>
     <p>Rainbow-tinted , softly , glitteringly , gayly fluttering , out they flew by thousands and thousands , and hovered about the maiden ’ s head ; and the soft sound of their wings , which mortal ears are too dull to hear , seemed to say , “ Welcome ! welcome !”</p>
     <p>At the same moment a great flock of beautiful birds came , flying , and lighted on the branches all around , and they , too , sang , “ Welcome ! welcome !”</p>
     <p>The maiden clasped her hands and cried , “ Why are you all so glad to see me ? I feel — I know — that you are all mine , and I am yours ; but how is it ? Who am I ? What is my name ?”</p>
     <p>And birds and flowers and rainbow-hued butterflies and sombre pine-trees all answered in joyous chorus , “ Spring ! the beautiful , the long-expected ! Hail to the maiden Spring !”</p>

     <p>THE PATIENT CAT .</p>
     <p>WHEN the spotted cat first found the nest , there was nothing in it , for it was only just finished . So she said , “ I will wait !” for she was a patient cat , and the summer was before her . She waited a week , and then she climbed up again to the top of the tree , and peeped into the nest . There lay two lovely blue eggs , smooth and shining .</p>
     <p>The spotted cat said , “ Eggs may be good , but young birds are better . I will wait .” So she waited ; and while she was waiting , she caught mice and rats , and washed herself and slept , and did all that a spotted cat should do to pass the time away .</p>
     <p>When another week had passed , she climbed the tree again and peeped into the nest . This time there were five eggs . But the spotted cat said again , “ Eggs may be good , but young birds are better . I will wait a little longer !”</p>
     <p>So she waited a little longer and then went up again to look . Ah ! there were five tiny birds , with big eyes and long necks , and yellow beaks wide open . Then the spotted cat sat down on the branch , and licked her nose and purred , for she was very happy . “ It is worth while to be patient !” she said .</p>
     <p>But when she looked again at the young birds , to see which one she should take first , she saw that they were very thin ,— oh , very , very thin they were ! The spotted cat had never seen anything so thin in her life .</p>
     <p>“ Now ,” she said to herself , “ if I were to wait only a few days longer , they would grow fat . Thin birds may be good , but fat birds are much better . I will wait !”</p>
     <p>So she waited ; and she watched the father-bird bringing worms all day long to the nest , and said , “ Aha ! they must be fattening fast ! they will soon be as fat as I wish them to be . Aha ! what a good thing it is to be patient .”</p>
     <p>At last , one day she thought , “ Surely , now they must be fat enough ! I will not wait another day . Aha ! how good they will be !”</p>
     <p>So she climbed up the tree , licking her chops all the way and thinking of the fat young birds . And when she reached the top and looked into the nest , it was empty ! !</p>
     <p>Then the spotted cat sat down on the branch and spoke thus , “ Well , of all the horrid , mean , ungrateful creatures I ever saw , those birds are the horridest , and the meanest , and the most ungrateful ! Mi-a-u-ow !!! !”</p>

      <head>BY THE FADING LIGHT .</head>
      <head>THERE was only one chapter more to finish the book . Bell did want very much indeed to finish it , and to make sure that the princess got out of the enchanted wood all right , and that the golden prince met her , riding on a jet-black charger and leading a snow-white palfrey with a silver saddle for her , as the fairy had promised he would .</head>
       <l n="1">She did want to finish it , and it seemed very hard that she should be</l>
       <l n="2">interrupted every minute .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>First it was dear Mamma calling for a glass of water from her sofa in the next room , and of course Bell sprang with alacrity to answer that call .</p>
     <p>But then baby came , with a scratched finger to be tied up , and then Willy boy wanted some more tail for his kite , and he could not find any paper , and his string had got all tangled up .</p>
     <p>Then came little Carrie , and she had no buttons small enough for her dolly ’ s frock , and did sister think she had any in her work-basket ?</p>
     <p>So sister looked , and Carrie looked , too , and between them they upset the basket , and the spools rolled over the floor and under the chairs , as if they were playing a game ; and the gray kitten caught her best spool of gold-colored floss , and had a delightful time with it , and got it all mixed up with her claws so that she couldn ’ t help herself , and Bell had to cut off yards and yards of the silk .</p>
     <p>At last it was settled , and the little girl supplied with buttons , and Bell sank back again on the window-seat , so glad that she hadn ’ t been impatient , and had seen how funny the kitten looked , so that she could laugh instead of scold about the silk .</p>
     <p>“ And when the golden prince saw the Princess Merveille , he took her hand and kissed it , for it was like the purest ivory and delicately shaped . And he said —”</p>
     <p>Tinkle ! tinkle ! went the door-bell , and Bell , with a long sigh , laid down the book and went to the door , for Mary was out . It was old Mr. Grimshaw .</p>
     <p>“ Good-day , miss !” he said , with old-fashioned courtesy , “ I have come to borrow the third volume of ‘ Paley ’ s Evidences .’ I met your worthy father , and he was good enough to say that you would find the book for me . I am of the opinion that he mentioned the right-hand corner of the third shelf in some bookcase ; I do not rightly remember in which room .”</p>
     <p>Bell showed the old gentleman into the study and brought him a chair , and looked in the right-hand corners of all the shelves ; then she looked in the left-hand corners ; then she looked in the middle ; then she looked on Papa ’ s desk , and in it and under it .</p>
     <p>Then she looked on the mantel-piece , and in the cupboard , and in the chairs , for there was no knowing where dear Papa would put a book down when his thinking-cap was on . All the time Mr. Grimshaw was delivering a lecture on Paley , and telling her on what points he disagreed with him , and why ; and Bell felt as if a teetotum were going round and round inside her head .</p>
     <p>At last , in lifting Papa ’ s dressing-gown , which hung on the back of a chair , she felt something square and heavy in one of the pockets ; and — there was the third volume of “ Paley ’ s Evidences .”</p>
     <p>She handed it to Mr. Grimshaw with her prettiest smile , and he went away thinking she was a very nice , well-mannered little girl .</p>
     <p>And so she was ; but — oh dear ! when she got back to the window-seat the daylight was nearly gone .</p>
     <p>Still , the west was very bright , and perhaps she could just find out .</p>
     <p>“ And he said , ‘ Princess , my heart is yours ! Therefore , I pray you , accept my hand , also , and with it my kingdom of Grendalma , which stretches from sea to sea . Ivory palaces shall be yours , and thrones of gold ; mantles of peacock feathers , with many chests of precious stones .’ So the princess —”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Bell !” called Mamma from the next room . “ It is too late to read , dear !</l>
       <l n="2">Blindman ’ s Holiday , you know , is the most dangerous time for the eyes .</l>
       <l n="3">So shut the book , like a dear daughter !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">Bell shut the book , of course ; but a cloud came over her pleasant face ,</l>
       <l n="5">and two little cross sticks began beating a tattoo on her heart .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Just at that moment came voices under the window ,— Carrie and Willy boy , talking earnestly . “ Would a princess be very pretty , do you suppose , Willy ? prettier than Bell ?”</p>
     <p>“ Ho !” said Willy , “ who cares for ‘ pretty ?’ She wouldn ’ t be half so nice as Bell . Why , none of the other fellows ’ sisters —”</p>
     <p>They passed out of hearing ; and even so the cloud passed away from Bell ’ s brow , and she jumped up and shook her head at herself , and ran to give Mamma a kiss , and ask if she would like her tea .</p>

      <head>THE LAZY ROBIN .</head>
       <l n="1">THE mother robin woke up in the early morning and roused her three</l>
       <l n="2">children .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Breakfast time , my dears !” she said ; “ and a good time for a flying lesson , besides . You did well enough yesterday , but to-day you must do better . You must fly down to the ground , and then I will show you how to get worms for yourselves . You will soon be too old to be fed , and I cannot have you more backward than the other broods .”</p>
     <p>The young robins were rather frightened , for they had only had two short flying lessons , taking little flapping flutters among the branches . The ground seemed a long , long way off !</p>
     <p>However , two of them scrambled on to the edge of the nest , and after balancing themselves for a moment , launched bravely out , and were soon standing beside their mother on the lawn , trembling , but very proud .</p>
     <p>The third robin was lazy , and did not want to fly . He thought that if he stayed behind and said he was sick , his mother would bring some worms up to him , as she had always done before . So he sat still in the nest , and drooped his head .</p>
     <p>“ Come along !” cried the mother robin . “ Come , Pecky ! Why are you sitting there alone ?”</p>
     <p>“ I — don ’ t feel very well ,” said Pecky . “ I don ’ t feel strong enough to fly .”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Oh !” said his mother , “ then you had better not eat any breakfast , and</l>
       <l n="2">I will send for Doctor Woodpecker .”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Oh no , please don ’ t !” cried Pecky , and down he fluttered to the lawn .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ That ’ s right !” said the mother robin , approvingly . “ I thought there was not much the matter with you . Now bustle about , my dear ! See how well your brother and sister are doing ! I declare , Toppy has got hold of a worm as long as himself . It will get away from him — no , it won ’ t ! There ! he has it now ! Ah ! that was a good mouthful , Toppy . You will be a fine eater !”</p>
     <p>Pecky sat still , with his head on one side . He felt quite sure that if he waited and did nothing , his mother would take compassion on him and bring him some worms . There were Toppy and Flappy , working themselves to death in the hot sun . He had always been his mother ’ s favourite ( so he thought , but it was not really so ) , and he was quite sure that she would not let him go hungry .</p>
     <p>So he gave a little squeak , as if quite tired out , and put his head still more on one side , and shut his eyes , and sat still . Now his mother did not see him at all , for her back was turned , and she was eating a fine caterpillar , having no idea of waiting on lazy birds who were old enough to feed themselves .</p>
     <p>But some one else did see Master Pecky ! Richard Whittington , the great gray cat , had come out to get his breakfast , too , and he saw the lazy robin sitting still in the middle of the lawn with his eyes shut .</p>
     <p>Richard could not have caught one of the others , for they all had their wits about them , and their sharp black eyes glanced here and there , and they were ready to take flight at a moment ’ s notice .</p>
     <p>But Richard Whittington crept nearer and nearer to the lazy robin . Suddenly — pounce ! he went . There was a shrill , horrified squeak , and that was the last of poor Pecky Robin .</p>
     <p>The mother robin and her two other children flew up into the tree and grieved bitterly for their lost Pecky , and the mother did not taste a single worm for several hours .</p>
     <p>But Richard Whittington enjoyed his breakfast exceedingly ; and he was as good-natured as possible all day , and did not scratch the baby once .</p>
     <p>THE BOY ’ S MANNERS .</p>
     <p>THE Boy was going out to Roxbury . He was going alone , though he was only five years old . His Aunt Mary had put him in the horse car , and the car went directly past his house ; and the Boy “ hoped he did know enough to ask somebody big to ask the conductor to stop the car .”</p>
     <p>So there the Boy was , all alone and very proud , with his legs sticking straight out , because they were not long enough to hang over ,— but he did not mind that , because it showed his trousers all the better ,— and his five cents clutched tight in his little warm hand .</p>
     <p>Proud as he was , the Boy had a slight feeling of uneasiness somewhere down in the bottom of his heart . His Aunt Mary had just been reading “ Jack and the Bean-stalk ” to him , and he was not quite sure that the man opposite him was not an ogre . He was a very , very large man , about twelve feet tall , the boy thought , and at least nine feet round . He had a wide mouth , full of sharp-looking teeth , and he rolled his eyes as he read the newspaper . He was not dressed like an ogre , and he carried no knife in sight ; but it might be in one of the pockets of his big gray coat .</p>
     <p>Altogether , the Boy did not like the looks of this man at all , but nobody else seemed to mind him . A pretty girl sat down close beside him ,— a plump , tender-looking young girl ,— but the big man took no notice of her or anybody else , and kept on reading his newspaper and rolling his eyes .</p>
     <p>So the Boy sat still , only keeping a good lookout , so that if this formidable person should pull out a knife , or begin to grind his teeth and roar , “ Fee ! fi ! fo ! fum !” he could slip off the seat and out at the door before his huge enemy could get upon his feet .</p>
     <p>The car began to fill up rapidly . Soon every seat was occupied , and several men were standing up . One of them trod , by accident , on the ogre ’ s toe ,— the Boy could not help calling him the ogre , though he felt it might not be right ,— and he gave a kind of growl , which made the Boy quiver and prepare to jump ; but his eyes never moved from his newspaper , so the Boy sat still .</p>
     <p>By and by a poor woman got in , with a heavy baby in her arms . She looked very tired , but though there were several other men sitting down beside the big gray one , no one moved to give the woman a seat .</p>
     <p>The boy remembered his manners , and knew that he ought to get up ; but then came the thought , “ If I get up , I shall be close to the ogre , for there is no standing-room anywhere else . I am wedged so close between these two ladies that I can hardly get out : and if I do , there cannot possibly be room for that large woman .”</p>
     <p>The Boy gave heed to this thought , though he knew in his heart that it did not make any difference . Just then the tired woman gave a sigh and shifted the heavy baby to the other arm .</p>
     <p>The Boy did not wait any longer , but slipped at once down from his seat . “ Here is a little room , ma ’ am !” he said , in his clear , childish voice . “ There isn ’ t enough for you , but you might put the baby down , and rest your arms .”</p>
     <p>At that moment the car gave a lurch , and the Boy lost his balance and fell forward ,— right against the knees of the ogre .</p>
     <p>“ Hi ! hi !” said the big man , putting aside his newspaper , “ what ’ s all this ? Hey ?”</p>
     <p>The Boy could not speak for fright ; but the poor woman answered , “ It ’ s the dear little gentleman offering me his seat for the baby , sir ! The Lord bless him for a little jewel that he is !”</p>
     <p>“ Hi ! hi !” growled the big man , getting heavily up from his seat and still holding the boy ’ s arm , which he had grasped as the child fell , “ this won ’ t do ! One gentleman in the car , eh ? And an old fellow reading his newspaper ! Here , sit down here , my friend !” and he helped the woman to his seat , and bowed to her as if she were a duchess . “ And as for you , Hop-o ’ - my-thumb —” Then he stooped and took the Boy up , and set him on his left arm , which was as big as a table . “ There , sir !” he said , “ sit you there and be comfortable , as you deserve .”</p>
     <p>The Boy sat very still ; indeed , he was too frightened to move . Since the man had called him Hop-o ’ - my-thumb , he was quite sure that he must be an ogre ; perhaps the very ogre from whom Hop and his brothers escaped . The book said he died , but books do not always tell the truth ; Papa said so .</p>
     <p>When the big man began to feel in the right-hand pockets of his gray coat , the child trembled so excessively that he shook the great arm on which he sat .</p>
     <p>The man looked quickly at him . “ What is the matter , my lad ?” he asked ; and his voice , though gruff , did not sound unkind . “ You are not afraid of a big man , are you ? Do you think I am an ogre ?”</p>
     <p>“ Yes !” said the boy ; and he gave one sob , and then stopped himself .</p>
     <p>The gray man burst into a great roar of laughter , which made every one in the car jump in his seat .</p>
     <p>Still laughing , he drew his hand from his pocket , and in it was — not a knife , but a beautiful , shining , golden pear . “ Take that , young Hop-o ’ - my-thumb ,” he said , putting it in the Boy ’ s hands . “ If you will eat that , I promise not to eat you ,— not even to take a single bite . Are you satisfied ?”</p>
     <p>The boy ventured to raise his eyes to the man ’ s face ; and there he saw such a kind , funny , laughing look that before he knew it he was laughing , too .</p>
     <p>“ I don ’ t believe you are an ogre , after all !” he said .</p>
     <p>“ Don ’ t you ?” said the big man . “ Well , neither do I ! But you may as well eat the pear , just the same .”</p>
     <p>And the Boy did .</p>

     <head>IN THE TUNNEL .</head>
     <p>WILL was digging a tunnel in the long drift . It was the longest drift that Will had ever seen , and he had meant to have Harry help him , but now they had quarrelled , and were never going to speak to each other as long as they lived , so Will had to begin alone .</p>
     <p>He dug and dug , taking up great solid blocks of snow on his shovel , and tossing them over his shoulder in a workman-like manner . As he dug , he kept saying to himself that Harry was the hatefullest boy he ever saw in his life , and that he was glad he shouldn ’ t see anything more of him . It would seem queer , to be sure , not to play with him every day , for they had always played together ever since they put on short clothes ; but Will didn ’ t care . He wasn ’ t going to be “ put upon ,” and Master Harry would find that out .</p>
     <p>It was a very long drift . Will had never made such a fine tunnel ; it did seem a pity that there should be no one to play with him in it , when it was done . But there was not a soul ; for that Weaver boy was so rude , he did not want to have anything to do with him , and there was no one else of his age except Harry , and he should never see Harry again , at least not to speak to .</p>
     <p>Dig ! dig ! dig ! How pleasant it would be if somebody were digging from the other end , so that they could meet in the middle , and then play robbers in a cave , or miners , or travellers lost in the snow . That would be the best , because Spot could be the faithful hound , and drag them out by the hair , and have a bottle of milk round his neck for them to drink . Spot was pretty small , but they could wriggle along themselves , and make believe he was dragging them . It would be fun ! but he didn ’ t suppose he should have any fun now , since Harry had been so hateful , and they were never — no , never going to speak again , if it was ever so —</p>
     <p>What was that noise ? Could it be possible that he was getting to the end of the drift ? It was as dark as ever ,— the soft , white darkness of a snowdrift ; but he certainly heard a noise close by , as if some one were digging very near him . What if —</p>
     <p>Willy redoubled his efforts , and the noise grew louder and louder ; presently a dog barked , and Will started , for he knew the sound of the bark . Just then the shovel sank into the snow and through it , and in the opening appeared Harry ’ s head , and the end of Spot ’ s nose . “ Hullo , Will !” said Harry .</p>
     <p>“ Hullo , Harry !” said Will .</p>
     <p>“ Let ’ s play travellers in the snow !” said Harry . “ This is just the middle of the drift , and we can be jolly and lost .”</p>
     <p>“ All right !” said Will , “ let ’ s !”</p>
     <p>They had a glorious play , and took turns in being the traveller and the pious monk of Saint Bernard ; and they both felt so warm inside , they had no idea that the thermometer was at zero outside .</p>

     <head>A STORMING PARTY .</head>
     <p>IT was at Stirling Castle . People who did not know might have called it the shed , but that would show their ignorance . On the ramparts was mustered a gallant band , the flower of Scotland , armed with mangonels , catapults , and bows and arrows ; below were the English , with their battering-rams and culverins and things . Ned was the English general , and led the storming party , and I was his staff , and Billy was the drummer , and drummed for the king . The Scottish general was Tom , and he had on Susie ’ s plaid skirt for a kilt , and his sporran was the rocking-horse ’ s tail that had come off .</p>
     <p>Well , there was lots of snow on the roof ,— I mean the ramparts , and they hurled it down on our heads , and we played ours was Greek fire , and hit them back like fun , I tell you . There was quite a mountain down below , where Andrew , the chore-man , had shovelled off the deep snow ; and we stood on this , and it was up to my waist , and I played it was gore , because in Scott they are always wading knee-deep in gore , and I thought I would get ahead of them and go in up to my waist .</p>
     <p>I hit General Montrose ( that was Tom ) with a splendid ball of Greek fire , and it was quite soft , and a lot of it got down his neck , and you ought to have seen him dance . He called me a dastardly Sassenach , and I thought at first he said “ sausage ,” and was as mad as hops , but afterward I didn ’ t care .</p>
     <p>Then Ned called for volunteers to storm the castle , and we all ran to the ladder ; but Ned climbed up the spout , ’ cause he can shin like sixty , and he got up before we did . He took the warder by the throat , just like the Bold Buccleugh in “ Kinmont Willie ,” and chucked him right off the roo — ramparts into the gore . That made Montrose mad as a hornet , and he rushed on Ned , and they got each other round the waist , and went all over the roof , till at last they got too near the edge , and over they both went . Billy was scared at that and stopped drumming , but I drew my mangonel ( Susie says that isn ’ t the right name , but I don ’ t believe she knows ) and rushed on the Scottish troops , which were only Jimmy Weaver , now that Montrose and the warder were gone . I got Jimmy down , and put my knee on his chest and shouted , “ Victory ! the day is ours ! Saint George for England !”</p>
     <p>But then I heard somebody else yelling , and I looked over the ramparts , and there was Montrose with his knee on Ned ’ s chest , waving his culverin and shouting , “ Victory ! the day is ours ! Saint Andrew for Scotland !”</p>
     <p>I was perfectly sure that our side had beaten , and Tom was absolutely certain that he had won a great victory ; but just then mother called us in to tea , so we could not fight it over again to decide . Anyhow , Montrose got so much Greek fire down his neck that he had to change everything he had on , and I didn ’ t have to change a thing except my stockings .</p>

       <l n="1">IT was a very hot day , and the little boy was lying on his stomach</l>

     <p>The little boy ’ s father happened to be close by , weeding the geranium bed ; and when he heard this , he lifted the little boy gently by his waistband , and dipped him in the great tub of water that stood ready for watering the plants .</p>
     <p>“ There , my son !” said the father . “ Now you are cool enough to go and get the lettuce ; but remember next time that it will be easier to go at once when you are told as then you will not have to change your clothes .”</p>
     <p>The little boy went drip , drip , dripping out into the garden and brought the lettuce ; then he went drip , drip , dripping into the house and changed his clothes ; but he said never a word , for he knew there was nothing to say .</p>
     <p>That is the way they do things where the little boy lives . Would you like to live there ? Perhaps not ; yet he is a happy little boy , and he is learning the truth of the old saying ,—</p>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="6">And Letty danced into the house , and danced out again with her brown</l>
       <l n="7">poke bonnet over her sunny hair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="8">“ Here I am , Miss Sophia !” she cried . “ Now , where shall we go ?”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="9">“ Down the lane !” said Miss Sophia , “ and through the orchard into the</l>
       <l n="10">fields . Perhaps we may find some strawberries .”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>So away they went , the young lady walking demurely along , while the little girl frolicked and skipped about , now in front , now behind . It was pretty in the green lane . The ferns were soft and plumy , and the moss firm and springy under their feet . The trees bent down and talked to the ferns , and told them stories about the birds that were building in their branches ; and the ferns had stories , too , about the black velvet mole who lived under their roots , and who had a star on the end of his nose .</p>
     <p>But Letty and Miss Sophia did not hear all this ; they only heard a soft whispering , and never thought what it meant .</p>
     <p>Presently they came out of the lane , and passed through the orchard , and then came out into the broad , sunny meadow .</p>
     <p>“ Now , Letty ,” said Miss Sophia , “ use your bright eyes , and see if you can find any strawberries ! I will sit under a tree and rest a little .”</p>
     <p>Away danced Letty , and soon she was peeping and peering under every leaf and grass blade ; but no gleam of scarlet , no pretty clusters of red and white could she see . Evidently it was not a strawberry meadow . She came back to the tree , and said ,—</p>
     <p>“ There are no strawberries , at all , Miss Sophia , not even one . But I have found something else . Wouldn ’ t you like to see it ? Something very pretty .”</p>
     <p>“ What is it , dear ?” asked Miss Sophia . “ A flower ? I should like to see it , certainly .”</p>
     <p>“ No , it is not a flower ,” said Letty ; “ it ’ s a cow .”</p>
     <p>“ What ?” cried Miss Sophia , springing to her feet .</p>
     <p>“ A cow ,” said Letty , “ a pretty , spotted cow . She ’ s coming after me , I think .”</p>
     <p>Miss Sophia looked in the direction which Letty pointed , and there , to be sure , was a cow , moving slowly toward them . She gave a shriek of terror ; then , controlling herself , she threw her arms around Letty .</p>
     <p>“ Be calm , my child !” she said , “ I will save you ! Be calm !”</p>
     <p>“ Why , what is the matter , Miss Sophia ?” cried Letty in alarm .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Miss Sophia ’ s face was very pale , and she trembled ; but she seized</l>
       <l n="2">Letty ’ s arm , and bade her walk as fast as she could .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ If we should run ,” she said , in a quivering voice , “ it would run after us , and then we could not possibly escape . Walk fast , my child ! Don ’ t scream ! Try to keep calm !”</p>
     <p>“ Why , Miss Sophia !” cried the astonished child , “ you don ’ t think I ’ m afraid of that cow , do you ? Why , it ’ s —”</p>
     <p>“ Hush ! hush !” whispered Miss Sophia , dragging her along , “ you will only enrage the creature by speaking aloud . I will save you , dear , if I can ! See ! we are getting near the fence . Can ’ t you walk a little faster ?”</p>
     <p>“ Moo-oo-ooo !” said the cow , which was now following them at a quicker pace .</p>
     <p>“ Oh ! oh !” cried Miss Sophia . “ I shall faint , I know I shall ! Letty , don ’ t faint too , dear . Let one of us escape . Courage , child ! Be calm ! Oh ! there is the fence . Run , now , run for your life !”</p>
     <p>The next minute they were both over the fence . Letty stood panting , with eyes and wide mouth open ; but Miss Sophia clasped her in her arms and burst into tears .</p>
     <p>“ Safe !” she sobbed . “ My dear , dear child , we are safe !”</p>
     <p>“ Yes , I suppose we are safe ,” said the bewildered Letty . “ But what was the matter ? It was Uncle George ’ s cow , and she was coming home to be milked !”</p>
     <p>“ Moo-oo-oo !” said Uncle George ’ s cow , looking over the fence .</p>

      <head>A GREAT DAY .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ CHILDREN ,” asked Miss Mary , the teacher , “ do you know what day this</l>
       <l n="2">is ?”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Yes , ma ’ am !” cried Bobby Wilkins , looking up with sparkling eyes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">“ Does any one else know ?” asked Miss Mary .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>No one spoke . The boy John knew very well what day it was , but he was off in the clouds , thinking of William the Conqueror , and did not hear a word Miss Mary said . Billy Green knew , too , but he had been reproved for chewing gum in class , and was in the sulks , and would not speak . Of course Joe did not know , for he never knew anything of that kind ; and none of the girls were going to answer when the boys were reciting . So Bobby Wilkins was the only one who spoke .</p>
     <p>“ It is a day ,” said Miss Mary , looking round rather severely , “ which ought to waken joy in the heart of every American , young or old .”</p>
     <p>Bobby felt his cheeks glow , and his heart swell . He thought Miss Mary was very kind .</p>
     <p>“ It is a day ,” she went on , “ to be celebrated with feelings of pride and delight .”</p>
     <p>Bobby felt of the bright new half-dollar in his pocket , and thought of the splendid kite at home , and of the cake that mother was making when he came away . He had not wanted to come to school to-day , but now he was glad he had come . He had no idea that Miss Mary would feel this way about it . He looked round to see how the others took it , but they all looked blank , except the boy John , who was standing on the field of Hastings , and whose countenance was illumined with the joy of victory .</p>
     <p>“ It is a day ,” said Miss Mary , with kindling eyes ( for the children were really very trying to-day ) , “ which will be remembered in America as long as freedom and patriotism shall endure .”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Bobby felt as if he were growing taller . He saw himself in the</l>
       <l n="2">President ’ s chair , or mounted on a great horse , like the statues of</l>
       <l n="3">Washington , holding out a truncheon .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">“ One hundred and eighteen years ago to-day ,” cried Miss Mary —</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">“ Oh ! oh my , it ain ’ t !” cried Bobby Wilkins , springing up . “ It ’ s only</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">“ Bobby , what do you mean ?” asked Miss Mary , looking at him severely .</l>
       <l n="8">“ You are very rude to interrupt me . What do you mean by ‘ seven ?’”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">“ My birthday ,” faltered Bobby . “ I ain ’ t a hundred anything , I ’ m only</l>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Come here , dear !” said Miss Mary , holding out her hand very kindly . “ Come here , my little boy . I wish you very many happy returns , Bobby dear ! but — but I was speaking of the battle of Bunker Hill .”</p>
     <p>Poor Bobby ! Miss Mary shook her head at the children over his shoulder , as he sat in her lap , as a sign not to laugh , but I suppose they could not help it . They did laugh a good deal ,— all except the boy John , who was watching Harold die , and feeling rather sober in consequence .</p>

      <head>RICHES .</head>
       <l n="1">“ MAMMA ,” said Mabel , “ I am very glad we are rich !”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Mamma looked up with a little smile ; she was patching Freddy ’ s trousers , and had just been wondering whether they would last till spring , and if not , how she was to get him another pair .</p>
     <p>“ Yes , Mabel dear ,” she said . “ We are very rich in some things . What were you thinking about when you spoke ?”</p>
     <p>“ I was thinking how dreadful it would be to be hungry ,” replied Mabel , thoughtfully . “ I mean terribly hungry , like people in a shipwreck . Why , just to be a little hungry , the way Freddy and I get sometimes , makes me feel all queer inside ; and besides , it makes me cross and horrid . So then I wondered how it would feel to be really hungry , and not to be sure that you were going to have good bread and milk for supper ; and that made me feel so glad that we were rich .”</p>
     <p>Mamma was silent for a few minutes . She was thinking of a house to which she took some work the day before . She had passed through the dining-room , and there , at the carved table , sat a little girl with her supper before her ,— delicate rolls , and cold chicken , and raspberry jam , and hot cocoa in a china cup all covered with roses , and creamy milk in a great silver mug .</p>
     <p>The child was about Mabel ’ s age , but her face wore a very different expression . She had pushed her chair back , and was crying out that she would not eat cold chicken . She wouldn ’ t , she wouldn ’ t , she wouldn ’ t ! so there now ! The nurse might just as well take it away , and she was a horrid cross old thing ! Mamma was going to have partridge for dinner , and she wanted some of that , and she would have it .</p>
     <p>Then , when the nurse shook her white-capped head and said , “ No miss ! your Mamma said you were to have the chicken ; so now eat it , like a good girl , and you shall have some jam ,” the child flew at her like a little fury , and slapped and pinched her . That was all that Mabel ’ s Mamma saw , but as she thought of it , and then looked at her little maiden , with a sweet face smiling over her blue pinafore , she smiled again , very tenderly , and said ,—</p>
     <p>“ Yes , dear , it is a very good thing to be rich , if it is the right kind of riches . Go now , darling , and get the bread and milk ; set the table , and then call Freddy in to supper .”</p>
     <p>POVERTY .</p>
     <p>IT was a lovely day in June , and the poor little girl was going out . She was so poor that she had to go in a great big carriage , with two fat , slow horses and a sleepy driver , who got very angry if you asked him to drive a little faster . She was dressed in a white frock , frilled and flounced , and she had a fashionable little hat on her head , which stuck up in front , so that the wind was always catching it and blowing it off . She had tight kid gloves on her little hands , and beautiful little bronze kid boots on her feet ; so you see she was very poor indeed .</p>
     <p>The carriage rolled slowly along through the park , and the little girl saw many other poor children , also sitting in carriages , with tight kid gloves and kid boots ; she nodded to them , and they to her , but it was not very interesting . By and by they left the park , and drove out into the country , where there were green fields , with no signs to keep people off the grass . The grass was full of buttercups , and in one field were two little girls , running about , with their hands full of the lovely golden blossoms , laughing and shouting to each other . One had a pink calico dress on , and the other a brown gingham , and they were barefooted , and their sunbonnets were lying on the grass . The poor little girl looked at them with sparkling eyes .</p>
     <p>“ Oh , Mademoiselle !” she cried , “ may I get out and run about a little ? See what a good time those children are having ! Do let me jump out , please !”</p>
     <p>“ Fi donc , Claire !” said the lady who sat beside her . She was a thin , dark lady , with sharp , eager black eyes , and not a pleasant face . “ Fi donc ! What would madame , your mother , say , if she heard you desiring to run in the fields like the beggar children ? Those children — dirty little wretches !— are barefooted , and it is evident that their hair has never known the brush . Do not look at them , child ! Look at the prospect !”</p>
     <p>“ I don ’ t care about the prospect !” said the poor child . “ I want some buttercups . We never have buttercups at our house , Mademoiselle . I wish I might pick just a few !”</p>
     <p>“ Assuredly not !” cried Mademoiselle , her eyes growing blacker and sharper . “ Let you leave the carriage and run about in the mire , for the sake of a few common , vulgar flowers ? Look at your dress , Claire ! Look at your delicate shoes , and your new pearl-colored gloves ! Are these the things to run in the dirt with ? I will not be responsible for such conduct . Sit still , and when we reach home the gardener shall pick you some roses .”</p>
     <p>“ I don ’ t want roses !” said the poor little girl , sighing wearily . “ I am tired of roses . I want buttercups !”</p>
     <p>She sighed again , and leaned back on the velvet cushions ; the carriage rolled on . The barefoot children gazed after it with wondering eyes .</p>
     <p>“ My !” said one , “ wasn ’ t she dressed fine , though !”</p>
     <p>“ Yes ,” said the other ; “ but she looked as if she was having a horrid time , poor thing .”</p>
     <p>“ Poor thing !” echoed the first child .</p>
     <p>THE BEST OF ALL .</p>
     <p>“ I MEAN to have the best time this Fourth of July that I ever had in my life ,” said the Big Boy . Then all the other big boys clustered round him to hear what the good time was to be , and the little boy sighed and wished he were big , too . The big boys did not tell him what they were going to do , but I know all about it , so I can tell . They made a camp in the Big Boy ’ s room , which is out in the barn . One boy brought a comforter , and another brought a pair of blankets ; and there was an old spring mattress up in the loft , so that with the Big Boy ’ s own bed , which could hold two ( if you kept very still and didn ’ t kick the other fellow out ) , they did very well indeed . The Big Boy ’ s mother , knowing something of boys , had set out a lunch for them , crackers and cheese , and gingerbread and milk , so there was no danger of starvation .</p>
     <p>Of course they were busy in the early part of the evening , buying their firecrackers and torpedoes , their fish-horns and all their noisy horrors ( for you must understand that this was the night before the Glorious Fourth ) ; but by nine o ’ clock they were all assembled in the barn , ready to have the very best time in the world . First they ate some lunch , and that was good ; then they thought they would take a nap , just for an hour or so , that they might not be sleepy when the time came . Two of them lay down on the Big Boy ’ s bed , and two on the old spring mattress , and two on the floor ; but it did not make much difference where they began their nap , for when the boys ’ mother took a peep at them about ten o ’ clock , she found them all lying in a heap on the floor , sound asleep , though the Thin Boy was groaning in his sleep because the Fat Boy was lying across his neck .</p>
     <p>Suddenly the Big Boy awoke with a start , and looking at his watch , found that it was half past eleven . Hastily he roused the sleepers , and there was a hurrying and scurrying , a hunting for caps , a snatching up of horns and slow-match . Then softly they stole down the barn stairs , and away they went to the old church , and up they climbed into the belfry . The sexton had left the door unlocked , having been a boy himself once ; so there they waited till twelve o ’ clock came . Ah ! what a grand time they had then , “ ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple ;” but it only lasted an hour , and then there was all the rest of the night . They went here and they went there , and when they grew hungry they went back to the barn and finished the lunch ; and then they tried to go to sleep again , but they kept falling about so , it was no use , so they waited till they thought their own houses would be open , and then they went home , and the Big Boy crept into his bed and slept till noon .</p>
     <p>But the Little Boy woke up at six o ’ clock , and jumped up like a lark , and got his torpedoes and firecrackers , and was very cheerful , though he did sigh just once when he thought of the big boys . He turned the gravel-sweep into a battle-field , and made forts and mines for the firecrackers , and then he cracked and snapped and fizzed and blazed — at least the firecrackers did — all the morning . He only burned his fingers twice and his trousers five times , and that was doing very well . He had a glorious day ; and his mother thought — but neither the Little Boy nor the Big Boy agreed with her — that the best part of all was the good night ’ s sleep beforehand .</p>

     <p>THE YOUNG LADIES .</p>
     <p>THE young ladies had a reception this afternoon , and a charming occasion it was . The guests were invited for four o ’ clock , and when I came in at five the party was in full swing .</p>
     <p>Clare was the hostess ,— lovely Clare , with her innocent blue eyes and gentle , unchanging smile . The nursery was transformed into a bower of beauty , and Clare was standing by a chair , holding out her hand with a gracious gesture of welcome . Alida received with her , and she looked charming , too , only she was so much smaller that she had to be stood up on a box to bring her to a level with Clare ’ s shoulder . Alida is a remarkable doll , because she can open and shut her eyes without lying down or getting up ; and Betty sat on the floor behind her and pulled the strings , so that she waved her long eyelashes up and down in the most enchanting manner .</p>
     <p>All the dolls were in their best clothes , except Jack the sailor , who cannot change his suit , because it is against his principles ; and I must say they made a pretty party . The tea-things were set out on the little round table , all the best cups and saucers , and the pewter teapot that came from Holland , and the gold spoons ; and there was real cocoa , and jam , and oyster crackers , and thin bread and butter .</p>
     <p>Rosalie Urania presided at the tea-table , and poured the cocoa with such grace that no one would have suspected her of being helped a little by Juliet ( Juliet is not a doll ) , who was hidden behind the table .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Will you have a cup of cocoa ?” asked Rosalie , sweetly , as Mr .</l>
       <l n="2">Punchinello approached her with his most elegant bow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ With pleasure , lovely maiden !” was the courtly reply . “ From your hands</l>
       <l n="4">what would not your devoted Punchinello take ?”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>He bowed and smiled again ( indeed , he was always smiling ) , while Rosalie , blushing ( it was a way she had ) , lifted the pewter teapot , and deftly filled one of the pretty cups .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ He ’ ll take a licking from my hands if he doesn ’ t look out !” growled</l>
       <l n="2">Jack , the sailor , who is jealous of Punchinello , and loves Rosalie</l>
       <l n="3">Urania .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Hush , you rude creature !” whispered Alida , giving Jack a little push . Clare is quite sure that Alida only meant the push as a gentle rebuke to Jack , and a warning to keep quiet , and not let his angry passions rise ; but Clare always stands up for Alida . However it was , Jack tottered , staggered forward , and fell against Mr. Punchinello , knocking that smiling gentleman over on the table , and upsetting the teapot all over Rosalie Urania ’ s pink silk gown . Such a confusion as arose then ! Rosalie fainted , of course . Jack picked himself up , and looked black as thunder . Alida shut her eyes , and kept them shut ( she said it was from horror , but it may have been because Betty forgot to pull the opening string ) , but Clare and Mr. Punchinello did nothing but smile , which was a proof of their exquisite breeding .</p>

     <p>LILIES AND CAT-TAILS .</p>
     <p>“ MOTHER ,” said Roger , swinging in at the door and catching up the baby for a toss , “ I am going to begin Physical Geography ! And teacher says I must have a book , please , as soon as I can get it . It costs two dollars , and it ’ s just full of pictures , oh , so interesting ! And may I get it to-day , please , mother ?”</p>
     <p>“ Mother ” looked up with a sad little loving smile . “ Dear heart ,” she said , “ I have not two dollars in the world just now , unless I take them from the money I am saving for your new suit , and I hardly ought to do that , my poor Roger !”</p>
     <p>Roger looked down with a rueful whistle at his clothes , which , though clean , were patched and darned to the utmost limit .</p>
     <p>“ I ’ m afraid the Patent Mosaic Suit is rather past the bloom of youth ,” he said , cheerily . “ Never mind , mammy ! Perhaps Will Almy will lend me his book , sometimes , or I can study in recess out of Miss Black ’ s . Don ’ t worry , anyhow , but catch Miss Dumpling here , while I go and bring in some water .”</p>
     <p>Mrs. Rayne sighed deeply , as Roger set the baby on her lap and darted out of the house . She knew it was to hide his face of disappointment that the boy had gone off so hurriedly .</p>
     <p>Poor Roger ! so bright , so eager to learn , he ought to have a first-rate education ! But how could she , a widow with four children on a tiny farm , give it to him ? Bread and butter and decent clothing must come first , and these were hard enough to win , even though she worked all day and half the night for them . Education must be picked up as it could .</p>
     <p>The little woman shook her head and sighed again , as she put Miss Dumpling on the floor with a button-string to play with , and took up the pile of mending .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">But Roger , though he was disappointed , had no idea of giving up the</l>
       <l n="2">Physical Geography . Not a bit of it !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Mother cannot get it for me ,” he said , as he turned away at the windlass of the old well . “ Very well , then , I must get it myself . The only question is , how ?”</p>
     <p>Up came the brimming bucket , and , as he stooped to lift it , he saw in the clear water the reflection of a bright , anxious face , with inquiring eyes and a resolute mouth . “ Don ’ t be afraid , old fellow !” he said , with a reassuring nod . “‘ How ?’ is a short question , and I am sure to find the answer before the day is out ,” and , whistling merrily , he went off to water the garden .</p>
     <p>That evening , just as the sun was sinking , all golden and glorious beneath the horizon , a boat pushed out from among the reeds that fringed Pleasant Pond . It was a rough little dory of no particular model , painted a dingy green , but its crew was apparently well satisfied with it . One boy sat in the stern and paddled sturdily : another crouched in the bow , scanning the reeds with a critical air , while between them sat a little fair-haired maiden , leaning over the side and singing , as she dipped her hands in the clear , dark water .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Here ’ s a fine bunch of cat-tails !” cried Roger . “ Shove her in here ,</l>
       <l n="2">Joe !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Joe obeyed , and Roger ’ s knife was soon at work cutting the stately</l>
       <l n="4">reeds , with their sceptre-tips of firm , brown velvet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">“ Oh , and here are the lilies !” cried little Annet . “ See , Roger ! see !</l>
       <l n="6">all white and gold , the lovely things ! Oh , let me pull them !”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>In another moment , the boat seemed to be resting on a living carpet of snow and gold . The lilies grew so thick that one could hardly see the water between them . Roger and Annet drew them in by handfuls , laying them in glistening piles in the bottom of the boat , and soon Joe laid down his paddle , and joined in the picking .</p>
     <p>“ Some pooty , be n ’ t they ?” he said . “ What d ’ ye cal ’ late ter sell ’ em for , Roger ?”</p>
     <p>“ For whatever I can get ,” replied Roger , cheerfully . “ I ’ ve never tried it before , but I know that plenty of boys do take them to the city from other ponds and streams . We are a little farther off , but I never saw any lilies so large as ours .”</p>
     <p>“ Nor so sweet !” cried Annet , burying her rosy face in the golden heart of a snowy cup . “ Oh , how I love them !”</p>
     <p>How the lilies must have wondered at the adventures that befell them after this ! All night they lay in a great tub of water , which was well enough , though there was no mud in it . Then , at daybreak next morning they were taken out and laid on a bed of wet moss and covered with wet burdock leaves . Then came a long period of jolting , when the world went bumping up and down with a noise of creaking and rumbling , broken by the sound of human voices .</p>
     <p>Finally , and suddenly , they emerged into the full glare of the sun , and found themselves in a new world altogether ,— a street corner in a great city ; tall buildings , glittering windows , crowds of men and women hurrying to and fro like ants about an ant-hill . Only the cool , wet moss beneath them , and the sight of their old friends , the cat-tails , standing like sentinels beside them , kept the lilies from fainting away altogether .</p>
     <p>Roger looked eagerly about him , scanning the faces of the passers-by . Would this one buy ? or that one ? that pretty lady , who looked like a lily herself ? He held out a bunch timidly , and the lady smiled and stopped .</p>
     <p>“ How lovely and fresh ! Thank you !” and the first piece of silver dropped into Roger ’ s pocket , and chinked merrily against his jackknife . Then another young lady carried off a huge bunch of cat-tails , and a second piece of silver jingled against the first .</p>
     <p>Soon another followed it , and another , and another , and Roger ’ s eyes danced , and his hopes rose higher and higher .</p>
     <p>At this rate , the Physical Geography would be his , beyond a doubt . He saw it already ,— the smooth green covers , the delightful maps within , the pictures of tropical countries , of monkeys and cocoanuts , elephants and — THUMP ! His dream was rudely broken in upon by a gentleman running against him and nearly knocking him over ,— an old gentleman , with fierce , twinkling eyes and a bushy gray beard .</p>
     <p>“ What ! what !” sputtered the old gentleman , pettishly . “ Get out of my way , boy ! My fault ! beg your pardon !” Roger moved aside , bewildered by the sudden shock .</p>
     <p>“ Will you buy some Physical Geographies , sir ?” he asked . “ See how fresh they are ? They are the loveliest —”</p>
     <p>“ This boy is a lunatic !” said the old gentleman , fiercely , “ and ought to be shut up . How dare you talk to me about Physical Geography , sir ?”</p>
     <p>Roger stared at him blankly , and then grew crimson with shame and confusion . “ I — I beg your pardon , sir !” he faltered , “ I meant to say ‘ lilies .’ I was thinking so hard about the geography that it slipped out without my knowing it . I suppose . I —”</p>
     <p>“ What ! what !” cried the old gentleman , catching him by his arm . “ Thinking about Physical Geography , hey ? What d ’ ye mean ? This is a remarkable boy . Come here , sir ! come here !”</p>
     <p>He dragged Roger to one side , and made him sit down beside him on a convenient doorstep . “ What d ’ ye mean ?” he repeated , fixing his piercing gray eyes upon the boy in a manner which made him feel very uncomfortable . “ What do you know about Physical Geography ?”</p>
     <p>“ Nothing yet , sir ,” replied Roger , modestly . “ But I am very anxious to study it , and I am selling these lilies and cat-tails to try and get money enough to buy the book .”</p>
     <p>“ This is a most remarkable boy !” cried the old gentleman . “ What geography is it you want , hey ? Merton ’ s , I ’ ll warrant . Trash , sir ! unspeakable trash !”</p>
     <p>“ No , sir ; Willison ’ s ,” replied the boy , thinking that the old gentleman was certainly crazy .</p>
     <p>But on hearing this , his strange companion seized him by the hand , and shook it warmly . “ I am Willison !” he exclaimed . “ It is my Geography ! You are a singularly intelligent boy . I am glad to meet you .”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Roger stared in blank wonderment . “ Did — did you write the Physical</l>
       <l n="2">Geography , sir ?” he stammered , finally .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ To be sure I did !” said the old gentleman , “ and a good job it was ! While that ass Merton ,— here ! here !” he cried , fumbling in his pockets , “ give me the lilies , and take that !” and he thrust a shining silver dollar into Roger ’ s hand . “ And here !” he scribbled something on a card , “ take that , and go to Cooper , the publisher , and see what he says to you . You are an astonishing boy ! Good-by ! God bless you ! You have done me good . I was suffering from dyspepsia when I met you ,— atrocious tortures ! All gone now ! Bless you !”</p>
     <p>He was gone , and Roger Rayne was sitting alone on the steps , with the dollar in one hand , and the card in the other , as bewildered a boy as any in Boston town .</p>
     <p>When he recovered his senses a little , he looked at the card and read , in breezy , straggling letters , “ Give to the astonishing boy who brings this , a copy of my Physical Geography . Best binding . William Willison .”</p>

      <head>THE SPECKLED HEN .</head>
      <head>THERE was once a hen with brown speckled wings and a short black tail . She stood in a shop window , on a bit of wood covered with green baize , and kept watch over the eggs with which the window was filled .</head>
       <l n="1">“ I may be stuffed ,” said the hen , “ but I hope I know my duty for all</l>
       <l n="2">that !”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>There were many eggs , and some of them were very different from the eggs to which she had been accustomed ; but she did not see what she could do about that .</p>
     <p>“ Their mothers must be people of very vulgar tastes ,” she said , “ or else fashions have changed sadly . In my day a hen who laid red or blue or green eggs would have been chased out of the barnyard ; but the world has gone steadily backward since then , I have reason to think .”</p>
     <p>She was silent , and fixed her eyes on a large white egg which had been recently placed in the window .</p>
     <p>There was something strange about that egg . She had never seen one like it . No hen that ever lived could lay such a monstrous thing ; even a turkey could not produce one of half the size .</p>
     <p>Whence could it have come ? She remembered stories that she had heard , when a pullet , of huge birds as tall as the hen-house , called ostriches . Could this be an ostrich egg ? If it was , she could not possibly be expected to take care of the chick .</p>
     <p>“ The idea !” she said . “ Why , it will be as big as I am !”</p>
     <p>At this moment a hand appeared in the window . It was the shopkeeper ’ s hand , and it set down before the hen an object which filled her with amazement and consternation .</p>
     <p>It looked like an egg : that is , it was shaped and coloured like an egg ; but from the top , which was broken , protruded a head which certainly was not that of a chicken .</p>
     <p>The head wore a black hat ; it had a round , rosy face , something like the shopkeeper ’ s , and what could be seen of the shoulders was clad in a bottle-green coat , with a bright-red cravat tied under the pink chin .</p>
     <p>The little black eyes met the hen ’ s troubled glance with a bright and cheerful look .</p>
     <p>“ Good-morning !” said the creature . “ It ’ s a fine day !”</p>
     <p>“ What are you ?” asked the hen , rather sternly . “ I don ’ t approve of your appearance at all . Do you call yourself a chicken , pray ?”</p>
     <p>“ Why , no ,” said the thing , looking down at itself . “ I — I am a man , I think . Eh ? I have a hat , you see .”</p>
     <p>“ No , you are not !” cried the hen , in some excitement . “ Men don ’ t come out of eggs . You ought to be a chicken , but there is some mistake somewhere . Can ’ t you get back into your shell , and — a — change your clothes , or do something ?”</p>
     <p>“ I ’ m afraid not ,” said the little man ( for he was a man ) . “ I don ’ t seem to be able to move much ; and besides , I don ’ t think I was meant for a chicken . I don ’ t feel like a chicken .”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , but look at your shell !” cried the poor hen . “ Consider the example you are setting to all these eggs ! There ’ s no knowing what they will hatch into if they see this sort of thing going on . I will lend you some feathers ,” she added , coaxingly , “ and perhaps I can scratch round and find you a worm , though my legs are pretty stiff . Come , be a good chicken , and get back into your shell !”</p>
     <p>“ I don ’ t like worms ,” said the little man , decidedly . “ And I am not a chicken , I tell you . Did you ever see a chicken with a hat on ?”</p>
     <p>“ N — no ,” replied the hen , doubtfully , “ I don ’ t think I ever did .”</p>
     <p>“ Well , then !” said the little man , triumphantly .</p>
     <p>And the hen was silent , for one cannot argue well when one is stuffed .</p>
     <p>The little man now looked about him in a leisurely way , and presently his eyes fell on the great white egg .</p>
     <p>“ Is that your egg ?” he asked , politely .</p>
     <p>The hen appreciated the compliment , but replied , rather sadly , “ No , it is not . I do not even know whose egg it is . I expect to watch over the eggs in a general way , and I hope I know my duty ; but I really do not feel as if I could manage a chicken of that size . Besides ,” she added , with a glance at the black hat and the bottle-green coat , “ how do I know that it will be a chicken ? It may hatch out a — a — sea-serpent , for aught I know .”</p>
     <p>“ Would you like to make sure ?” asked the little man , who really had a kind heart , and would have been a chicken if he could . “ There seems to be a crack where this ribbon is tied on . Shall I peep through and see what is inside ?”</p>
     <p>“ I shall be truly grateful if you will !” cried the hen . “ I assure you it weighs upon my mind .”</p>
     <p>The little man leaned over against the great white egg , and took a long look through the crack .</p>
     <p>“ Compose yourself !” he said , at last , looking at the hen with an anxious expression . “ I fear this will be a blow to you . There are five white rabbits inside this egg !”</p>
     <p>The speckled hen rolled her glass eyes wildly about and tried to cackle , but in vain .</p>
     <p>“ This is too much !” she said . “ This is more than I can bear . Tell the shopkeeper that he must get some one else to mind his eggs , for a barnyard where the eggs hatch into rabbits is no place for me .”</p>
     <p>And with one despairing cluck , the hen fell off the bit of wood and lay at full length on the shelf .</p>
     <p>“ It is a pity for people to be sensitive ,” said the little man to himself , as he surveyed her lifeless body . “ Why are not five rabbits as good as one chicken , I should like to know ? After all , it is only a man who can understand these matters .”</p>
     <p>And he cocked his black hat , and settled his red necktie , and thought very well of himself .</p>

      <head>THE MONEY SHOP .</head>
      <head>JACK RUSSELL was five years old and ten days over ; therefore , it is plain that he was now a big boy . He had left off kilts , and his trousers had as many buttons as it is possible for trousers to have , and his boots had a noble squeak in them . What would you have more ?</head>
       <l n="1">This being the case , of course Jack could go down town with his Mamma</l>
       <l n="2">when she went shopping , a thing that little boys cannot do , as a rule .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>One day in Christmas week , when all the shops were full of pretty things , Jack and his Mamma found themselves in the gay street , with crowds of people hurrying to and fro , all carrying parcels of every imaginable shape .</p>
     <p>The air was crisp and tingling , the sleigh-bells made a merry din , and everybody looked cheerful and smiling , as if they knew that Christmas was only five days off .</p>
     <p>Almost everybody , for as Jack stopped to look in at a shop window , he saw some one who did not look cheerful . It was a poor woman , thinly and miserably clad , and holding a little boy by the hand .</p>
     <p>The boy was little , because he wore petticoats ( oh , such poor , ragged petticoats ) ! but he was taller than Jack . He was looking longingly at the toys in the window .</p>
     <p>“ Oh , mother !” he cried , “ see that little horse ! Oh , I wish I had a little horse !”</p>
     <p>“ My dear ,” said the poor woman , sighing , “ if I can give you an apple to eat with your bread on Christmas Day , you must be thankful , for I can do no more . Poor people can ’ t have pretty things like those .”</p>
     <p>“ Come , Jack !” said Mrs. Russell , drawing him on hastily . “ What are you stopping for , child ?”</p>
     <p>“ Mamma ,” asked Jack , trudging along stoutly , but looking grave and perplexed , “ why can ’ t poor people have nice things ?”</p>
     <p>“ Why ? Oh !” said Mrs. Russell , who had not noticed the poor woman and her boy , “ because they have no money to buy them . Pretty things cost money , you know .”</p>
     <p>Jack thought this over a little in his own way ; then , “ But , Mamma ,” he said , “ why don ’ t they buy some money at the money shop ?”</p>
     <p>Mrs. Russell only laughed at this , and patted Jack ’ s head and called him a “ little goose ,” and then they went into a large shop and bought a beautiful wax doll for Sissy .</p>
     <p>But Jack ’ s mind was still at work , and while they were waiting for the flaxen-haired beauty to be wrapped in white tissue paper and put in a box , he pursued his inquiries .</p>
     <p>“ Where do you get your money , Mamma dear ?”</p>
     <p>“ Why , your dear Papa gives me my money , Jacky boy . Didn ’ t you see him give me all those nice crisp bills this morning ?”</p>
     <p>“ And where does my Papa get his money ?”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , child , how you do ask questions ! He gets it at the bank .”</p>
     <p>“ Then is the bank the money shop , Mamma ?”</p>
     <p>Mrs. Russell laughed absent-mindedly , for , in truth , her thoughts were on other things , and she was only half-listening to the child , which was a pity . “ Yes , dear ,” she said , “ it is the only money shop I know of . Now you must not ask me any more questions , Jack . You distract me !”</p>
     <p>But Jack had no more questions to ask .</p>
     <p>The next day , as the cashier at the National Bank was busily adding up an endless column of figures , he was startled by hearing a voice which apparently came from nowhere .</p>
     <p>No face appeared at the little window in the gilded grating , and yet a sweet , silvery voice was certainly saying , with great distinctness , “ If you please , I should like to buy some money .”</p>
     <p>He looked through the window and saw a small boy , carrying a bundle almost as big as himself .</p>
     <p>“ What can I do for you , my little man ?” asked the cashier kindly .</p>
     <p>“ I should like to buy some money , please ,” repeated Jack , very politely .</p>
     <p>“ Oh , indeed !” said the cashier , with a twinkle in his eye . “ And how much money would you like , sir ?”</p>
     <p>“ About a fousand dollars , I fink ,” said Jack , promptly . ( It does sometimes happen that big boys cannot pronounce “ th ” distinctly , but they are none the less big for that . )</p>
     <p>“ A thousand dollars !” repeated the cashier . “ That ’ s a good deal of money , young gentleman !”</p>
     <p>“ I know it ,” said Jack . “ I wants a good deal . I have brought some fings to pay for it ,” he added , confidentially ; and opening the big bundle with great pride , he displayed to the astonished official a hobby-horse , a drum ( nearly new ) , a set of building blocks and a paint-box .</p>
     <p>“ It ’ s a very good hobby-horse ,” he said , proudly . “ It has real hair , and he will go just as fast as — as you can make him go .”</p>
     <p>Here the cashier turned red in the face , coughed and disappeared . “ Perhaps he is having a fit , like the yellow kitten ,” said Jack to himself , calmly ; and he waited with cheerful patience till he should get his money .</p>
     <p>In a few moments the cashier returned , and taking him by the hand , led him kindly into a back room , where three gentlemen were sitting .</p>
     <p>They all had gray hair , and two of them wore gold-bowed spectacles ; but they looked kind , and one of them beckoned Jack to come to him .</p>
     <p>“ What is all this , my little lad ?” he asked . “ Did any one send you here to get money ?”</p>
     <p>Jack shook his head stoutly . “ No ,” he said , “ I comed myself ; but I am not little . I stopped being little when I had trousers .”</p>
     <p>“ I see !” said the gentleman . “ Of course . But what made you think you could get money here ?”</p>
     <p>The blue eyes opened wide .</p>
     <p>“ Mamma said that Papa got his money here ; and I asked her if this was a money shop , and she said it was the only money shop she knowed of . So I comed .”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Just so ,” said the kind gentleman , stroking the curly head before him .</l>
       <l n="2">“ And you brought these things to pay for the money ?”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Yes ,” said Jack , cheerfully . “’ Cause you buy fings with money , you</l>
       <l n="4">see , so I s ’ pose you buy money with fings .”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">“ And what did you mean to do with a thousand dollars ?” asked the</l>
       <l n="6">gentleman . “ Buy candy , eh ?”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Then Jack looked up into the gentle gray eyes and told his little story about the poor woman whom he had seen the day before . “ She was so poor ,” he said , “ her little boy could not have any Christmas at all , only an apple and some bread , and I ’ m sure that isn ’ t Christmas . And she hadn ’ t any money , not any at all . So I fought I would buy her some , and then she could get everything she wanted .”</p>
     <p>By this time the two other gentlemen had their hands in their pockets ; but the first one motioned them to wait , and taking the little boy on his knee , he told him in a few simple words what a bank really was , and why one could not buy money there .</p>
     <p>“ But you see , dear ,” he added , seeing the disappointment in the child ’ s face , “ you have here in your hands the very things that poor woman would like to buy for her little boy . Give her the fine hobby-horse and the drum and the paint-box , too , if you like , and she can give him the finest Christmas that ever a poor boy had .”</p>
     <p>Jack ’ s face lighted up again , and a smile flashed through the tears that stood in his sweet blue eyes . “ I never fought of that !” he cried , joyfully .</p>
     <p>“ And ,” continued the old gentleman , drawing a gold piece from his pocket and putting it in the little chubby hand , “ you may give that to the poor woman to buy a turkey with .”</p>
     <p>“ And that ,” cried the second old gentleman , putting another gold piece on top of it , “ to buy mince-pies with .”</p>
     <p>“ And that ,” cried the third old gentleman , while a third gold piece clinked on the other two , “ to buy a plum-pudding with .”</p>
     <p>“ And God bless you , my dear little boy !” said the first gentleman , “ and may you always keep your loving heart , and never want a piece of money to make Christmas for the poor .”</p>
     <p>Little Jack looked from one to the other with radiant eyes . “ You are very good shopkeepers ,” he said . “ I love you all very much . I should like to kiss you all , please .”</p>
     <p>And none of those three old gentlemen had ever had so sweet a kiss in his life .</p>
     <p>A LONG AFTERNOON .</p>
     <p>“ WHAT shall I do all this long afternoon ?” cried Will , yawning and stretching himself . “ What — shall — I — do ? A whole long afternoon , and the rain pouring and nothing to do . It will seem like a whole week till supper time . I know it will . Oh — dear — me !”</p>
     <p>“ It is too bad !” said Aunt Harriet , sympathetically . “ Poor lad ! What will you do , indeed ? While you are waiting , suppose you just hold this yarn for me .”</p>
     <p>Will held six skeins of yarn , one after another ; and Aunt Harriet told him six stories , one after the other , each better than the last .</p>
     <p>He was sorry when the yarn was all wound , and he began to wonder again what he should do all the long , long afternoon .</p>
     <p>“ Will ,” said his mother , calling him over the balusters , “ I wish you would stay with baby just a few minutes while I run down to the kitchen to see about something .”</p>
     <p>Will ran up , and his mother ran down . She was gone an hour , but he did not think it was more than ten minutes , for he and baby were having a great time , playing that the big woolly ball was a tiger , and that they were elephants chasing it through the jungle .</p>
     <p>Will blew a horn , because it spoke in the “ Swiss Family Robinson ” of the elephants ’ trumpeting ; and baby blew a tin whistle , which was a rattle , too ; and the tiger blew nothing at all , because tigers do not trumpet .</p>
     <p>It was a glorious game ; but when Mamma came back , Will ’ s face fell , and he stopped trumpeting , because he knew it would tire Mamma ’ s head .</p>
     <p>“ Dear Mamma !” he said , “ what shall I do this long , long afternoon , with the rain pouring and nothing to do ?”</p>
     <p>His mother took him by the shoulders , gave him a shake and then a kiss , and turned him round toward the window .</p>
     <p>“ Look there , goosey !” she cried , laughing . “ It stopped raining half an hour ago , and now the sun is setting bright and clear . It is nearly six o ’ clock , and you have just precisely time enough to run and post this letter before tea-time .”</p>

     <p>THE FIREWORKS .</p>
     <p>ONCE upon a time a little girl went to see the fireworks on Boston Common . She was a very small girl , but she wanted to go just as much as if she had been big , so her mother said she might go with Mary , the nurse . She put on her best bonnet , and her pink frock , and off they went .</p>
     <p>The Common was crowded with people , and in one part there was a dense throng , all standing together , and all looking in one direction . “ We must stand there , too ,” said Mary ; “ there ’ s where the fireworks are going to be .” So they went and stood in the dense crowd ; and the little girl saw the back of a fat woman in a red plaid shawl , but she could not see anything else . Oh , yes ! she saw the legs of the tall man who stood next to the fat woman , but they were not very interesting , being clad in a common sort of dark plaid : the shawl , at least , was bright , and she could tell the different colours by the lamplight .</p>
     <p>Now there was a movement in the crowd , and people cried , “ Oh ! oh ! look at that ! Isn ’ t that a beauty ?” And they clapped their hands and shouted ; but the little girl saw only the plaid shawl and the uninteresting legs of the tall man . The people pressed closer and closer , so that she could hardly breathe . She held tight to Mary ’ s hand , and Mary thought she was squeezing it for pleasure , and said , “ Yes , dear ! ain ’ t they lovely ?” The little girl tried to say , “ I can ’ t see anything but the plaid shawl !” but just then the tall man turned round , and looked down on her and said , “ Bless me ! here ’ s a little girl right under my feet . Can you see anything , my dear ?”</p>
     <p>“ Nothing but the red shawl and the back of your legs ,” said the little girl , sadly .</p>
     <p>“ Hi , then !” said the tall man ; “ up with you !” And before the child could say a word , he had taken her two hands and lifted her lightly to his shoulder .</p>
     <p>“ Put your arm round my neck ,” said the tall man . “ I had a little girl once , just like you , and I know how to hold you . So , now you are all right !”</p>
     <p>“ Thank the kind gentleman , dear !” said Mary . “ I ’ m sure it ’ s very good of him .”</p>
     <p>The little girl was too shy to speak , but she patted the tall man ’ s neck , and he understood as well as if she had spoken . Now she saw wonderful sights indeed ! Fiery serpents went up into the sky , wriggling and hissing , dragging long tails of yellow flame behind them . Coloured stars , red , blue and green , shot up in the air , hung for an instant , and then burst into showers of rainbow light . There were golden pigeons , and golden flower-pots , and splendid wheels , that went whirling round so fast it made the little girl dizzy to look at them . The child gazed and gazed , breathless with delight . Sometimes she forgot where she was , and thought this was fairy-land , all full of golden dragons , and fluttering elves , as the story books described it ; but if she chanced to look down , there was Mary , and the kind face of the tall man , and the red shawl of the fat woman . By and by came a great burst of light , and in the midst of crimson flames she saw the Goddess of Liberty , standing on a golden ball , waving the starry flag in her hand : thousands of stars shot up , blazed and burst ; loud noises were heard , like cannon-shots ; then , suddenly , darkness fell , and all was over .</p>
     <p>The crowd began to disperse .</p>
     <p>“ Now , little one ,” said the tall man , “ you have seen all there is to see .” And he made a motion to put her down ; but the little girl clung tight to his neck .</p>
     <p>“ Did your little girl ever kiss you ?” she whispered in his ear .</p>
     <p>“ Bless your little heart !” said the man , “ she did , indeed ; but it ’ s long since I ’ ve had a little girl to kiss me .”</p>
     <p>The child bent down and kissed him heartily on the cheek . “ If it hadn ’ t been for you ,” she cried , “ I should have seen nothing at all except the plaid shawl . I think you are the kindest man that ever lived , and I love you very much .” And then she slipped down , and taking her nurse ’ s hand , ran away home as fast as she could .</p>

     <p>SEE-SAW .</p>
     <p>PUNKYDOODLE was at one end of the see-saw , and Jollapin at the other . ( Those are not the boys ’ real names , but they will do just as well , and they look better on paper than Joe , and ,— oh ! well , no matter ! ) It was a very high see-saw , and they meant to have a fine time on it .</p>
     <p>“ I am an eagle !” cried Jollapin , as his end went up , up , till his breath was almost gone , and he had to hold on with all his might to keep from slipping . “ I — am — an eagle , I say . Ho ! see me fly up among the clouds ! I am sailing — Oh , I say ! don ’ t shake her like that , Punk , or you ’ ll have me off !”</p>
     <p>“ Well , you ’ ve been up long enough !” cried Punkydoodle . “ It ’ s my turn now . Look at me ! I am a flying dragon ! Observe my fiery eyes , and my long wiggling tail ! Hoish ! I am going to descend on the fields and dwellings of men , and lay them waste ; and I ’ ll never stop till they give me the king ’ s daughter for my bride . I may eat her up , but I am not sure . Depends upon how pretty she is ! Hoish ! I descend upon the —” Here he descended with such swiftness that speech became impossible , and Jollapin soared aloft again .</p>
     <p>“ I am a balloon this time !” he cried .</p>
     <p>“ You look like one !” said Punkydoodle , who had not relished his sudden descent on the fields and dwellings of men .</p>
     <p>“ I ’ m not an old Skinny , anyhow !” retorted Jollapin . “ I am a splendid balloon , and my name is the Air King . Proudly I ascend , rising triumphant through the ambient air .” ( Jollapin had been reading the papers , and his speech was inflated , like the balloon he represented . ) “ I pass through the clouds ; I pierce them ; I rise above them . The earth lies beneath me like a — like a —”</p>
     <p>“ Like a pancake !” suggested Punkydoodle , who had little imagination .</p>
     <p>“ I wish you wouldn ’ t interrupt me , Punk ! But what do I see ? Yes , I know it ’ s your turn now , but just wait a minute ! What do I see ? Another majestic air-ship , sailing gloriously toward me ! That ’ s you , Punky ! Now we ’ ll see-saw together , tiddledies up and down , and play the balloons are meeting . Ha ! we meet ! we salute in mid-air . I wave my gilded banner —”</p>
     <p>Here one balloon lost his balance and tumbled off , and the other tumbled on top of him , and there they both lay in a heap on the lawn .</p>
     <p>“ Anybody killed ?” asked the elder brother , looking up from his hoeing .</p>
     <p>“ I — guess — not !” said Punkydoodle , rising slowly and feeling himself all over . “ Jollapin is all right , ’ cause he has plenty of fat to fall on , but I got a pretty good thump , I can tell you .”</p>

       <l n="1">“ JOHN ,” said little Amy , “ did you ever send a valentine to anybody ?”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>John , the gardener , looked rather sheepish , and dug his spade into the geranium bed . “ Well , miss ,” he said , “ I have done such things when I were a lad . Most lads do , I suppose , miss .”</p>
     <p>Oh , that sly old John ! He knew perfectly well that he had a valentine in his pocket at that moment , a great crimson heart , in a lace-trimmed envelope , directed to Susan , the pretty housemaid . But there was no need of saying anything about that to little miss , he thought .</p>
     <p>“ If you were not so very old , John ,” continued Amy , looking seriously at him , “ I should ask you to send me one , because my Papa is away , and I have no brothers , and I don ’ t know any lads , as you call them . But I suppose you are altogether too old , aren ’ t you , John ?”</p>
     <p>John straightened his broad shoulders and looked down rather comically at the tiny mite at his feet . “ Why , Miss Amy ,” he said , “ whatever does make you think I be so very old ? Your Papa is a good bit older than I be , miss .”</p>
     <p>“ My Papa !” cried Amy , opening her eyes very wide . “ Why , John ! you told me yourself that you were a hundred years old . And I know my Papa isn ’ t nearly so old as that !”</p>
     <p>The gardener laughed . “ More shame to me , miss ,” he said , “ for telling you what wasn ’ t true . Sure it ’ s only in fun I was , Miss Amy , dear , for I ’ m not forty years old yet , let alone a hundred . But I hear Mary calling you to your dinner ; so run up to the house now , missy , and don ’ t think too much of what old John says to you .”</p>
     <p>Away ran little Amy , and John , left alone with his geraniums , indulged in a quiet but hearty laugh .</p>
     <p>“ To think of that !” he said to himself . “ A hundred years old ! Sure I must take care what I say to that young one . But the pretty lass shall have her valentine , that she shall , and as pretty a one as I can make !” and John dug his spade into the ground with right good-will .</p>
     <p>( It occurs to me that you children who live in the North may say here , “ What was he doing to the geranium-bed in February ?” but when I tell you that little Amy lives in Virginia , you will not think it so strange . )</p>
     <p>Saint Valentine ’ s Day was bright and sunny , and Amy was up early , flying about the house like a bird , and running every five minutes to the front door “’ Cause there might be a valentine , Mamma !”</p>
     <p>Presently she spied the postman coming up the gravel walk , and out she danced to meet him . Oh ! such a pile of letters as he took out of his leather bag .</p>
     <p>“ Miss Amy Russell ?” said the postman .</p>
     <p>“ Oh !” cried Amy , “ she ’ s me ! I mean me ’ s her ! I mean — oh ! oh ! one , two , three , four , five ! Oh , thank you , Mr. Postman ! You ’ re the best postman in the whole world !” And in she danced again , to show her treasures to Mamma . Gold lace , silver arrows , flaming hearts ! oh , how beautiful they were ! But suddenly — ting ! tingle ! ding ! a tremendous peal at the front door-bell .</p>
     <p>Down went the valentines in Mamma ’ s lap , and off flew the excited child again . But this time , when she opened the door , no sound escaped her lips . Her feelings were too deep for utterance .</p>
     <p>There on the doorstep lay a valentine , but such a valentine ! A large flat basket entirely filled with white carnations , with a border of scarlet geraniums , and in the middle a huge heart of deep red carnations , with the words “ My Valentine ” written under it in violets .</p>
     <p>Amy sat down on the doorstep , with clasped hands and wide-open eyes and mouth . She rocked herself backwards and forwards , uttering little inarticulate shrieks of delight .</p>
     <p>And John the gardener , peeping round the corner of the house , chuckled silently , and squeezed the hand of Susan , the pretty housemaid , who happened , curiously enough , to be standing very near him .</p>
     <p>“ Humph !” said John the gardener , “ I haven ’ t forgotten how to make valentines , if I be a hundred years old !”</p>

      <head>ONCE UPON A TIME .</head>
      <head>ONCE upon a time there was a little girl , just like you , who couldn ’ t count two . And she had a dreadful time about it ! She did not know she had two feet , so she sometimes forgot to put on both her shoes ; she did not know she had two eyes , so she would sometimes go to sleep with one eye , and stay awake with the other ; she did not know she had two ears , so she would sometimes hear half of what Mamma said , and not hear the other .</head>
       <l n="1">One day Mamma called to her and said , “ Pet , I want you to take this</l>
       <l n="2">syrup and put it in my closet !”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Now Pet was only listening with one ear , and so she only heard the first half of what Mamma said : “ I want you to take this syrup .” That was what she heard .</p>
     <p>She liked the syrup very much , for she had ten drops in a teaspoon whenever she had a sore throat , and she had always wished Mamma would give her more .</p>
     <p>And now she was just to “ take it .” That must mean to take the whole bottle , if she liked . She put the bottle to her lips and took a good long draught . It was more than half-empty when she stopped to take breath , and then ,— the syrup did not seem to taste good any longer . She put the bottle down .</p>
     <p>Oh — dear — me ! In about ten minutes Pet was the very sickest little girl you ever saw in your life . Mamma put her to bed , and sent for the doctor , and she had to take four different kinds of medicine before she got well , not one of which tasted good at all .</p>
     <p>So now , you see , it is a very good plan for little wee girls to learn to count two .</p>

      <head>GOOSEY LUCY .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">IT chanced one day that Lucy came into the kitchen just as Fido , her</l>
       <l n="2">Aunt Mary ’ s little dog , was eating his dinner .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">He had a good dinner , and he was making a great fuss over it , growling</l>
       <l n="4">with pleasure , shaking his ears and wagging his tail .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">His tail was a very funny one , with a little black bunch at the end of</l>
       <l n="6">it , and it wiggled and waggled this way and that way .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Fido ,” said Lucy , “ I don ’ t think you ought to wag your tail when you are eating . Mamma says we must sit very still at the table . To be sure , you are not sitting , and you are not at the table , but , all the same , I think you had better not wag your tail .”</p>
     <p>Fido paid no attention to these sensible remarks , but continued briskly to wag the offending tail .</p>
     <p>“ Do you hear me Fido ?” said Lucy . “ I say , don ’ t wag it !”</p>
     <p>Fido gave a short bark of protest , but took no further notice .</p>
     <p>“ Then I must hold it for you !” Lucy continued , severely . “ Mamma held my hands once when I would not stop cutting holes in my pinafore ; but I was young then , and I thought the spots ought to be taken out . But you are not young , Fido , and I wonder at you , that I do !”</p>
     <p>Then Lucy took hold of the tail , and tried to hold it ; but Fido danced about , and pulled it away , and then wagged it all the harder , thinking she meant to play with him .</p>
     <p>“ Indeed !” said Lucy , “ I am not playing , Master Fido . Now you shall see !”</p>
     <p>So she got a piece of stout twine , and tied Fido ’ s tail to the leg of a chair .</p>
     <p>“ There !” she said , “ now finish your dinner , like a good little dog , and don ’ t give me any more trouble .”</p>
     <p>But Fido would not eat his dinner with his tail tied up . He threw back his head , and gave a piteous little howl . Lucy sat down on a stool beside him , and folding her hands , as she had seen her mother do , prepared to give the naughty pet “ a good talking to ,” as nurse used to say .</p>
     <p>At that moment , however , her mother ’ s voice was heard , calling “ Lucy ! Lucy ! Where are you ?”</p>
     <p>“ Here , Mamma !” cried Lucy . “ I am coming ! I meant to pick them up before dinner , anyhow ! yes I did !” And she flew up stairs , for she knew quite well that she had set out all her doll ’ s dishes , tea-set and dinner-set and kitchen things , on the nursery floor , and left them there .</p>
     <p>And now nurse had come in with baby in her arms , and had walked right over the pretty French dinner-set , and there was very little of it left to tell the tale .</p>
     <p>Dear ! dear ! it was not at all nice to pick up the pieces , even if nurse had not been scolding all the time , and Mamma standing by with that grave look , waiting to see that it was properly done .</p>
     <p>But how about Fido ? Oh , Lucy had quite forgotten about Fido . But Fido had not forgotten himself , and a very hard time the poor little fellow was having .</p>
     <p>He ran round the chair several times , till he brought himself up close against it ; then he tried to unwind himself again , but only became more and more entangled . He pushed the hateful chair backwards till it struck a little table on which was a tray full of dishes . Over went the table , down went the tray , crash went the dishes !</p>
     <p>“ Yow ! yow ! yo-o-o-ow !” howled Fido .</p>
     <p>“ Oh ! oh ! oh !” shrieked Bridget , the cook , who came in at that moment ; and then — whack ! whack ! whack ! went the broomstick over the poor doggie ’ s back .</p>
     <p>The noise was so great that Mamma came flying down , and nurse and Lucy , too , with the broken soup tureen in her hand .</p>
     <p>“ Oh , don ’ t beat him !” cried Lucy , “ don ’ t beat him , Bridget ! It was my fault , for I tied him to the chair , and then forgot about him .”</p>
     <p>“ And why , for the pity ’ s sake , miss , did ye tie the baste to the chair ?” said Bridget , still angry . “ Look at every dish I have in the kitchen all broken in smithereens !”</p>
     <p>“ He would wag his tail while he ate his dinner ,” faltered Lucy , “ and I wanted to teach him better manners ; and so — and so —” But here poor Goosey Lucy broke down completely , and sat down among the shattered dishes , and hugged Fido and wept over him .</p>
     <p>And Fido , who had the sweetest temper in the world , wagged the poor abused tail ( which had been quickly released by nurse ) , and forgave her at once .</p>
     <p>And Bridget and nurse laughed ; and Mamma kissed her little foolish daughter , and bade her not cry any more .</p>
     <p>But Lucy had to go to bed , all the same , for Mamma said it was the only proper place for a child who had broken ( or caused to be broken , which amounted to the same thing ) , seventy-two dishes , large and small , in less than half an hour . And I suppose Mamma was right , don ’ t you ?</p>

      <head>GOOSEY LUCY ’ S NEW YEAR ’ S CALLS .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ WHERE are you going , Uncle Fred ?” asked Lucy .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">“ I am going to make New Year ’ s calls , little girl ,” replied Uncle Fred .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="3">“ And how do you make them ? What are they made of ?” inquired Lucy .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Oh — ah — my dear child !” said Uncle Fred , who was looking for his umbrella in a great hurry , “ they are not made of anything . You — ah — you just call , you know , on all the people you know . Oh , here it is ! Good-by , little girl ! I must be off .”</p>
     <p>And off he hurried , leaving Lucy , mystified , in the hall .</p>
     <p>“ You just call !” she repeated . “ Just call all the people you know . Why , that is easy enough , but what a funny thing to do !”</p>
     <p>She pondered a few minutes and then continued , “ I think I will go and make New Year ’ s calls . It must be great fun ! Perhaps I shall meet Uncle Fred , and then we can call together , and that will be just twice as loud .”</p>
     <p>Away ran the little girl to her room . Blue coat , blue leggings , blue mittens , swan ’ s-down hood , all were on in three minutes ’ time ; and without a thought of Mamma or nurse or anybody else , Lucy slipped out of the door , and ran merrily down the street .</p>
     <p>Oh , how fresh and clear the air was ! How the snow sparkled in the sunlight ! What a fine thing it was to make New Year ’ s calls !</p>
     <p>And now the question was , where she should call first . Why , at Grandma ’ s , of course ! her house was in the square , just round the corner . And then she would go to Aunt Maria ’ s , and then ,— well , she would think about the next place as she went along , but here was Grandmamma ’ s house now .</p>
     <p>Lucy looked up at all the windows , but no one was in sight .</p>
     <p>So much the better ! She planted herself squarely on the curbstone , and opening her mouth to its fullest extent , shouted , “ Grandmamma ! Grandmamma ! Grandmamma !! GrandMAMMA !! !”</p>
     <p>Her grandmother , who was sitting quietly by the fire , reading , heard the piercing screams , and running to the window as fast as her dear old feet could carry her , saw Lucy , panting and crimson , with her mouth just opening for another shout .</p>
     <p>Something had happened at home ,— an accident , probably ! No time must be lost . Grandmamma threw up the sash .</p>
     <p>“ Run and call the doctor !” she cried . “ Quick , dear ! Don ’ t stop to tell me about it , but run ! I will be there in three minutes !” And she shut the window , and trembling with anxiety , hastened to put on her shawl and bonnet , and almost ran through the snow to her daughter ’ s house .</p>
     <p>Meanwhile , Lucy ran on in high glee . “ I hadn ’ t thought of the doctor !” she said , “ but of course I will go there , as Grandmamma wishes it . What fun it is !”</p>
     <p>The doctor ’ s house was soon reached , and Lucy ’ s shouts brought the good man quickly to the door .</p>
     <p>“ Bless me !” he said , “ Mrs . Graham ’ s little girl ! Baby ill again , I suppose ? All right , my dear !” he cried to Lucy . “ I ’ ll be there instantly . Run and tell them I ’ m coming !” and he shut the door and called for his boots .</p>
     <p>Lucy danced along , enchanted with her new play , and soon reached Aunt Maria ’ s house , where she called again , with might and main . Now , Aunt Maria was slightly deaf , and when she heard her own name resounding in a clear , shrill scream , “ Aunt Mari-i-i-i-ia ! !” she thought it was a cry of fire !</p>
     <p>Throwing up the window ( she was a very nervous and excitable person ) , she shrieked , “ Fire ! fire ! Police ! watchman ! Help ! help ! Fire !! FIRE !! !” till everyone within a dozen blocks heard her , and came rushing to the rescue with buckets and fire extinguishers .</p>
     <p>Lucy was rather frightened at all this , and thought , on the whole , she would not make any more calls that day .</p>
     <p>So she went home . And there were Grandmamma and the doctor and Mamma , all waiting for her , with very grave faces .</p>
     <p>The two first had arrived , breathless and agitated , inquiring what had happened , and who was ill .</p>
     <p>Much perplexity followed . And now that the author of all the mischief had arrived , what should be done to her ?</p>
     <p>Lucy ’ s finger went into her mouth , and her head went down .</p>
     <p>But she told her story truthfully ; and it was such a funny one that the doctor burst into a roar of laughter , and Grandmamma laughed heartily , and even Mamma could not look grave .</p>
     <p>So Goosey Lucy had a lecture , and a New Year ’ s cookie , and went to tell her dolls all about it , while Mamma and Grandmamma and the doctor went to see how Aunt Maria was .</p>

      <head>THE QUACKY DUCK .</head>
      <head>THE Quacky Duck stood on the bank of the stream . And the frogs came and sat on stones and insulted him . Now the words which the frogs used were these ,—</head>
       <l n="1">“ Ya ! ha ! he hasn ’ t any hind-legs !</l>
       <l n="2">Ya ! ha ! he hasn ’ t any fore-legs !</l>
       <l n="3">Oh ! what horrid luck</l>
       <l n="4">To be a Quacky Duck !”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>These were not pleasant words . And when the Quacky Duck heard them , he considered within himself whether it would not be best for him to eat the frogs .</p>
     <p>“ Two good things would come of it ,” he said . “ I should have a savoury meal , and their remarks would no longer be audible .”</p>
     <p>So he fell upon the frogs , and they fled before him . And one jumped into the water , and one jumped on the land , and another jumped into the reeds ; for such is their manner . But one of them , being in fear , saw not clearly the way he should go , and jumped even upon the back of the Quacky Duck . Now , this displeased the Quacky Duck , and he said , “ If you will remove yourself from my person , we will speak further of this .”</p>
     <p>So the frog , being also willing , strove to remove himself , and the result was that they two , being on the edge of the bank , fell into the water . Then the frog departed swiftly , saying , “ Solitude is best for meditation .”</p>
     <p>But the Quacky Duck , having hit his head against a stone , sank to the bottom of the pond , where he found himself in the frogs ’ kitchen . And there he spied a fish , which the frogs had caught for their dinner , intending to share it in a brotherly manner , for it was a savoury fish . When the Quacky Duck saw it , he was glad ; and he said , “ Fish is better than frog ” ( for he was an English duck ) ! And , taking the fish , he swam with speed to the shore .</p>
     <p>Now the frogs lamented when they saw him go , for they said , “ He has our savoury fish !” And they wept , and reviled the Quacky Duck .</p>
     <p>But he said , “ Be comforted ! for if I had not found the fish , I should assuredly have eaten you . Therefore , say now , which is the better for you ?” And he ate the fish , and departed joyful .</p>

     <p>Ah ! little Hal must wait till daylight for that , for his tiny fingers refused to tell him what it was .</p>
     <p>Wait he did , very impatiently , consoling himself with his orange .</p>
     <p>But at last a little gray light came stealing in at the window , and two little bare feet went trotting across the floor , and two little hands held up a mysterious object to the light .</p>
     <p>It was a chicken ! a most beautiful yellow chicken , with bright black eyes and a little sharp beak , and ,— oh ! what was this ? Why ! why ! the chicken ’ s head came off , and the chicken ’ s body was all full of sugar-plums !</p>
     <p>“ Oh ! oh ! oh !” cried little Hal . “ Mammy ! Mammy ! come and look at dis chicken ! He can spit his head out !”</p>

      <head>THE PURPLE FISH .</head>
      <head>SHALL I tell you what happened to Elsie one day ? She was sitting on the beach in her green cart , which had lost both wheels , so that it was not of much use as a cart , though very nice to sit in . And presently , a purple fish , with a yellow tail , came and looked at her . And he said ,—</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Little maiden fair to see ,</l>
       <l n="2">Will you take a trip with me ?”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Elsie smiled and answered ,—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">“ Yes , I will , without a doubt ,</l>
       <l n="5">If you will not tip me out .”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Then the purple fish took the string of the cart in his mouth and swam away . The cart bobbed up and down on the waves , and behaved quite like a boat , and Elsie clapped her hands , and laughed and sang . The fish swam on and on , till at length he came to a little island , all covered with purple hyacinths and yellow violets . Here he stopped and bade Elsie get out , saying ,—</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Now , if you will marry me ,</l>
       <l n="2">Here we ’ ll live and happy be .”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">But Elsie did not like this at all , though the island was very</l>
       <l n="4">beautiful . She shook her head resolutely , and replied ,—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">“ If you please , I do not wish</l>
       <l n="6">For to marry any fish !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">Then the purple fish was angry , and his yellow tail quivered with</l>
       <l n="8">vexation . He said , sternly ,—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">“ If you will not be my wife ,</l>
       <l n="10">You shall stay here all your life !”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>And off he swam , taking the green cart with him . Poor Elsie was very unhappy , for she could not bear to think of spending her whole life on the island , and yet she did not want to marry a fish , even if her Mamma were willing , which she was quite sure she would not be . But , as she was sitting there , making a wreath of the yellow violets , two sea-gulls came flying by . They stopped when they saw Elsie , and one of them said ,—</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Here , upon this purple island ,</l>
       <l n="2">What do I see but a human chisland !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ There isn ’ t any such word as ‘ chisland !’” said Elsie . “ It is ‘ child ,’</l>
       <l n="4">don ’ t you know ?”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ I am not very familiar with English ,” replied the sea-gull . “ The other word rhymes better ; but I am not prejudiced . What are you doing here , child ?”</p>
     <p>“ Nothing !” replied Elsie . “ If you please , did you ever marry a fish ?”</p>
     <p>Both the sea-gulls showed strong signs of disgust at this , and said ,—</p>
     <p>“ We eat fish , but never marry them . Why do you ask ?”</p>
     <p>“ Because the purple fish with the yellow tail said I must stay here all my life unless I would marry him . And he has taken away my green cart , so that I cannot get home .”</p>
     <p>“ As to that ,” said the sea-gulls , “ we can easily manage to get you home . Put your arms around our necks and hold on tight !”</p>
     <p>So the sea-gulls flew away with Elsie , and brought her safely home . She kissed them and thanked them .</p>
     <p>“ What can I give you , dear sea-gulls ,” she asked , “ in return for your saving me from that horrid fish ?”</p>
     <p>“ Could you give us your golden curls ?” asked the sea-gulls . “ We think they would become us , and they are a thing not often seen in our society .”</p>
     <p>No , Elsie could not do that .</p>
     <p>“ But ,” she said , “ I can give you each a necklace of glass beads , fastened with a rosette of peach-coloured ribbon . I made them yesterday for my dolls , but you are welcome to them .”</p>
     <p>“ Just the thing !” said the sea-gulls .</p>
     <p>So Elsie put the necklaces round their necks , and they thanked her , and flew away . I have been told that they flew straight to the island , and spent the whole afternoon in making rude remarks to the purple fish with the yellow tail , but one need not believe all one hears .</p>

      <head>A CHRISTMAS RIDE .</head>
      <head>THE sleigh had just driven from the door , with a great jingling and shouting , and the little boy was left at home , with his foot up on the sofa , for he had a sprained ankle . “ I wish I could have gone !” said the little boy .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ You shall go !” said Sister Sunshine . “ We will go together , you and I !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">She brought a great book , with bright pictures in it , and sat down by</l>
       <l n="3">the little boy ’ s side .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ First , we must choose our carriage !” she said . There was a whole page of carriage pictures , all very splendid , and after some thought they chose a gilded shell , with the front turning over into a swan ’ s neck . An Empress of Russia had driven in this , the book said , and so they thought it was good enough for them . The horses were coal-black , and there were six of them , four more than Papa and the other children had . Sister Sunshine tucked the little boy well up , and it appeared that the robes were all of ermine and sable , whereas , he had been thinking that they were only a striped afghan . One does not always know things till one is told .</p>
     <p>“ Here we go !” cried Sister Sunshine . “ How the horses dash along ! It takes my breath away ! We are going to St. Petersburg to see the ice palace on the Neva . The Empress has sent her own private sleigh to take the little boy , and I can go , too , because I belong to him .”</p>
     <p>She turned the page , and there , sure enough , was the ice palace . The sun shone splendidly on it , and it looked as if the fairies had built it .</p>
     <p>“ There is the Empress waiting for us !” said Sister Sunshine . “ I suppose it would be polite to go in , wouldn ’ t it ?” The little boy thought it would , decidedly , so they took the Empress ’ s hand and went in , through one grand room after another . The Empress gave them each a lovely little porcelain stove to carry under their arm , for the ice halls were cold .</p>
     <p>“ I am used to it ,” she said , “ and do not mind it .” She showed them all her jewels , which shone and sparkled like living flames ; and then she brought them long sticks of candy , striped red and white , and cream walnuts , and barley sugar lions , just the things the little boy liked best ; and they both said , how funny it was that she should know all about it , when the people at home so often forgot and gave him horehound , which he could not abide , and then said it was good for his cold .</p>
     <p>After that they drove a long way over the ice , and the little boy thought he would like to go to Egypt and see if they knew their lessons about Moses there , because he sometimes forgot his . And there was Egypt , just a few pages off , with lots of pyramids , and the Sphinx , and all the right Egypty things . They got on camels and went to find some children , and there , to be sure , were plenty of them , all looking just exactly like the pictures in the Bible ; but not a single one of them knew anything about Moses , which made the little boy feel more puffed up than he had any reason to be .</p>
     <p>They left the carriage and got into a Nile boat , because they wanted to go over the Cataracts , and Sister Sunshine thought the horses might not like it ; but before they got to the very first one the little boy was sound asleep , and he never woke up till the others came home from their sleigh ride . He was quite sure that they could not possibly have had so good a time as he had ; and , anyhow , nobody had given them so much as a single bite of candy ; they said that themselves .</p>
     <p>A FUNNY FELLOW .</p>
     <p>A GREAT many queer things happen in this world , and this morning I saw one of them . We have a little aquarium ,— just a long glass box , with some stones arranged in it to form a pretty little rock-work , and plenty of bladder-wort for the fish to feed on .</p>
     <p>We have a good many fish ,— three stickle-backs , and a lot of dace , the pretty silver dace , and some minnows and a crayfish ; but the pride of the aquarium is the newt . Did you ever see a newt ? He is a little creature , like a lizard , about two inches long ; in color , light brown , with black spots . He is quite tame , and not in the least afraid of us . Well , yesterday morning I was watching the fish , and seeing that the greedy ones did not get more than their share of breakfast , when Master Newt came up out of the water and seated himself on the top of the rock-work , which projects an inch or two above the surface . He sat quite still for a few minutes , and I made no motion , thinking he had come to take a look at the upper world , and would prefer to be left to himself . Presently he began to move his little paws about ( they are just like tiny hands , with long , thin fingers ) , and to rub himself , and wriggle about in a very queer way . I had watched him for some minutes before I realized what he was doing , but suddenly it flashed upon me that he was going to change his skin . I knew that newts often changed their skin , but I never expected to see one do it . Presently it was loose enough , and my little friend began to draw it off , slowly , beginning with the paws . The skin came off in perfect shape , and in a moment there was a pair of fairy gloves floating in the water , the prettiest things that ever were seen . Next , Master Newt began to unbutton his waistcoat , so to speak , and then to take off coat , waistcoat , breeches and all . He did look very fine in his new coat , which shone with lovely colours , and was as soft and smooth as gossamer . I thought I should like to have a new dress every day if I could manage it with no more trouble than this . But what was he going to do with his old clothes ? There were no closets in the aquarium , no clothes-bags , no obliging old-clothes-fish who would take it off his hands and give him a trifle for it . What would he do with the old suit ?</p>
     <p>I was soon to see . Master Newt sat still for a few minutes after his great feat , seeming to enjoy the change , waving his delicate crest with evident satisfaction ; then he took up the old suit of skin , which lay on the rock beside him . And then ,— who can guess what he did next ? Mind , I saw this with my own two eyes , the very ones that are looking down on this paper as I write . Why , he rolled it up carefully , made a ball of it , and then ate it up !</p>

      <head>THE SNOWBALL .</head>
      <head>IT was a perfect snowball day ! There had been a heavy snowstorm , and then the sky had cleared and the weather turned soft and warm . What could be more delightful ?</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Rita was too little to go to school , but she was not too little to make</l>
       <l n="2">snowballs .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">So Mammy put on the little girl ’ s coat and hood , and leggings and</l>
       <l n="4">overshoes and mittens , and turned her out of doors in the sunshine .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Oh , how bright it was ! How the world sparkled and twinkled and laughed ! Rita laughed , too , and at first could only jump up and down for pure joy , and sing ,—</p>
     <p>“ Ho ! ho ! ho ! Pretty white snow !”</p>
     <p>A song of her own composition , of which she was justly proud .</p>
     <p>But presently she said to herself , “ snowballs !” and from that moment she had no time for singing or jumping .</p>
     <p>First she made some dumplings , and set them in a row on the piazza to bake in the sun ; then she saw three little birds in a tree , and threw the dumplings at them , in case they might be hungry .</p>
     <p>Then she made a pudding , and stirred it with a large icicle , which made the best possible pudding stick ; then she made some eggs , and pelted Rover with them till that good dog fairly yelled with excitement .</p>
     <p>At last she said , “ I know what I will do ! I ’ ll make a Great Snowball , like the Great Sausage in my German picture book .”</p>
     <p>So the little girl set to work , and rolled and patted and pressed till she had a well-shaped ball to begin with . Then she laid it on the smooth snow table-cloth of the lawn , and began to roll it in good earnest , here and there , over and over and over .</p>
     <p>The snow was in perfect condition , soft and moist ; every particle clung to the ball , which grew bigger and bigger and BIGGER and BIGGER !</p>
     <p>At last Rita ’ s arms were tired , and she stopped to rest and to look about her . She was at the end of the lawn , where the bank sloped up to the stone wall . How nice it would be if she could roll the Great Snowball up the bank , and push it to the top of the wall !</p>

     <p>Then Papa would see it when he came home to dinner , and he would be so ’ stonished ! he would say , “ Who — upon — yerth — put that great , hugeous snowball there ?” And Rita would say , “ I did , Pappy ! just ’ cisely all my own pitickiler self .”</p>
     <p>And then Papa would say , “ Why-ee ! what a great , big girl my Rita is ! I must take her to town to-morrow-day , and buy her a muff , and a doll with wink eyes , and a squeaky dog , and a prayer-book , and a nalbum , and big boots , and a gold watch and a stick of striped candy ! and then —” But by this time Rita was quite ready to go to work again .</p>
     <p>The snowball was very big by this time , quite as big as she was ; and the bank , though not high , was very steep . But Rita ’ s short arms were sturdy , and her courage knew no measure ; so at it she went , pushing the great ball up , inch by inch ; puffing , panting , her cheeks growing redder and redder , but with no thought of giving up .</p>
     <p>Now , by this time the snowball began to have its own ideas . Just at what point of bigness a snowball begins to have a mind of its own I cannot tell you , so you must ask some one wiser than I ; but this snowball had reached the point .</p>
     <p>At this moment it was saying to itself , “ What fun this child is having ! but I do not enjoy it at all . It is the pushing that is the fun , apparently . Why should not I push the child ? I am bigger than she ; it would be very pleasant to roll down the bank , and push her before me . I might try ! I think I will ! There !”</p>
     <p>Down went the snowball ! Down went little Rita ! roly-poly , rumble-tumble , ruffle-puffle , flop !</p>
     <p>When Papa drove into the yard , two minutes later , he saw a great mound of soft snow , with two little black legs sticking out of it .</p>
     <p>“ Never mind !” said Rita , shortly , when Papa had pulled her out , and she stood shaking the snow from her wet , rosy face , “ the old thing didn ’ t hurt me a bit , and it broke its old self all — to pieces !”</p>

      <head>A GREAT FIGHT .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THE first I heard of it was when Fred came rushing into the house after</l>
       <l n="2">breakfast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ The enemy !” he cried . “ The enemy is upon us !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">“ Where ?” cried the rest of us , jumping up .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="5">“ In the battle-field , of course !” he said ; and he seized his flag and</l>
       <l n="6">rushed out again .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>We followed as quickly as we could . I put on the helmet , and Max took the drum , and we let Toddles have the bugle this time , because he had just tumbled down ; and he had the hearth-broom , too , so he was all right . We ran into the field , and found that the enemy had taken up a strong position behind the old cannon . ( Ours is a real battle-field , you know , and has been there ever since the war . ) We formed in line , and Fred made a flank movement , meaning to take the enemy in the rear ; but when he heard Fred coming , he charged on our line , and Toddles ran away , but Max and I retreated in good order , and formed again behind a rock , and began to shell him with green apples . He stopped to eat the apples , and meanwhile Fred completed his flank movement , and falling on the enemy ’ s rear , whacked it violently with a stick , waving his flag all the time , and shouting , “ Yield , caitiff ! Yield , craven hound !” ( I tell him that nowadays people don ’ t say those things in war , but he says that Roland and Bayard did , and that what suited them will suit him . )</p>

     <p>Well , the enemy turned suddenly on Fred , and drove him back against the cannon : but by that time we had advanced again , and Toddles was blowing the bugle as hard as he could , which seemed to disconcert the foe . Fred took a flying leap from the cannon right over his back , and putting himself at our head , rallied us for a grand charge . We rushed forward , driving the enemy before us . A panic seized him , and he fled in disorder ; we pursued him as far as the fence , and he got through a hole and escaped , but not before we each had a good whack at him . It was a glorious victory ! Fred made us a speech afterward from the top of the cannon , and we all waved everything we had to wave , and vowed to slay the invader if ever he dared to show his nose on our side of the fence again .</p>
     <p>So that was all !</p>
     <p>“ Who was the enemy ?” Why , didn ’ t I say ? Farmer Thurston ’ s pig , of course !</p>

     <head>HALLELUJAH !</head>
     <p>THE trees were still bare , and the grass brown and sere in the Northern city ; but the sky was blue and cloudless , and the air warm and soft . On a bench under one of the leafless trees in the park sat an old man , gray-haired and poorly clad . His eyes were fixed on the ground , and he was thinking of many sorrowful things . Suddenly he heard a little clear voice saying , “ Didn ’ t they give you any flowers ?”</p>
     <p>He looked up and saw a little wee girl standing before him , with her hands full of flowers . She had a round , rosy face and round blue eyes , and a little round rosebud of a mouth ; and she was looking at him very seriously indeed . “ Didn ’ t they give you any flowers ?” she repeated .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ No , dear ,” said the old man , gently ; “ nobody gave me any flowers .</l>
       <l n="2">Where did you get your pretty posies ?”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ In church , of course ,” said the child . “ The minister gives us all flowers . You shall have some of mine ,” and she took some sprays of lily of the valley and a red rose and laid them in the old man ’ s withered hand . “ Does that make you glad ?” she asked , anxiously . “ The minister says everybody must be glad to-day .”</p>
     <p>“ Why must everybody be glad , my little angel ?” asked the old man , sadly .</p>
     <p>“ Because Christ the Lord is risen ,” said the child . “ Didn ’ t you know that ? Don ’ t you know that this is Easter Day ?”</p>
     <p>The old man smiled , and raised the flowers to his lips and kissed them . “ I have been ill , my little angel ,” he said , “ but you have made me almost well again , and I will be glad ! Christ the Lord is risen indeed .”</p>
     <p>“ Hallelujah !” cried the child , eagerly .</p>
     <p>“ Hallelujah !” echoed the old man , reverently .</p>
     <p>“ Hallelujah !” sang the bluebird in the leafless tree .</p>
     <p>“ Hallelujah !” said the whole wide world .</p>

      <head>MERRY CHRISTMAS .</head>
      <head>“ I AM going to be merry all day long !” announced Wilfrid over his baked potato . “ It is Merry Christmas and I ’ m going to show you how to be merry .”</head>
       <l n="1">“ How ?” queried Ben and Kitty .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Why , it ’ s just — just to be merry !” replied Wilfrid , loftily . “ No matter what happens , all day long , we must laugh . If you fall down stairs , Ben , as you did yesterday , instead of howling , just laugh ! You ’ ll see — ow ! this potato is awfully hot . I ’ ve burned my finger like fun .”</p>
     <p>“ Ha ! ha ! ha !” shouted Ben and Kitty , as loud as they could .</p>
     <p>“ What are you laughing at , I should like to know ?” cried their brother , looking up rather savagely from the finger he was nursing . “ I don ’ t see the joke ! Guess if it was your finger —”</p>
     <p>“ Merry Christmas !” cried Ben .</p>
     <p>“ We are laughing ’ cause you told us to , Willy !” said Kitty . “ Oh , isn ’ t it funny , brother burned his finger ! Why don ’ t you laugh , too , Willy ?”</p>
     <p>Wilfrid was silent a moment ; then he gave a forced laugh . “ Of course !” he said , glancing rather sheepishly in the direction of Papa , who sat quiet behind his newspaper , and appeared to be taking no notice . (“ But you never can tell whether he really is or not ,” he reflected . ) “ Of course ! I didn ’ t say I should laugh if you hurt yourselves , children , but it ’ s all right . You see I laugh , though I really hurt myself very much indeed ” ( with another glance at Papa ) ! “ Come , now ! what shall we play till it ’ s time to get ready for church ? I vote for ‘ Old Man I ’ m on your Castle !’ We can play right on the hearth-rug here , and I ’ ll be ‘ Old Man .’”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ I want to be ‘ Old Man !’” protested little Kitty . “ You ’ s always ‘ Old</l>
       <l n="2">Man ,’ Willy !”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“’ Cause I ’ m the oldest !” responded her brother , promptly . “ Come on , Kitty , and laugh , you know ! Don ’ t look as if I had trodden on your toes just because you want to be ‘ Old Man .’ We must laugh all the more when we don ’ t get the things we want , don ’ t you see ?”</p>
     <p>The game went on merrily , and all three were laughing with right good-will , when Wilfred caught his foot in a corner of the rug and fell , striking his head pretty sharply against the table . He was dazed for a moment , but as the children ’ s laughter rang out , he started to his feet with looks of fury .</p>
     <p>“ You hateful little things !” he began , crimson with rage .</p>
     <p>But at this moment another laugh was heard . Papa put down his newspaper and began , “ Ha ! ha ! ha ! ho ! ho ! ho ! this is Merry Christmas , indeed ! Why don ’ t you laugh , Wilfrid , my boy ? Ho ! ho ! this is remarkably funny . Why don ’ t you laugh ? Why , this is the best joke I have heard to-day . Go to your mother , dear , and ask her to put some arnica on your head , but don ’ t forget to laugh all the way .”</p>
     <p>“ That is the worst of Papa ,” said Wilfrid to himself , as he went slowly up stairs , rubbing his head , and casting baleful glances at the two little laughing children .</p>
     <p>“ He always makes you do things — when you say you are going to — even if they don ’ t turn out a bit the way you thought they would .”</p>
     <p>THE LITTLE DOG WITH THE GREEN TAIL .</p>
     <p>AN UNTRUE STORY .</p>
     <p>ONCE upon a time there came to the town where all the little dogs live a strange little dog , whose tail was of a most beautiful bright green color ,— so bright that it shone like an emerald . Now , when all the other little dogs saw this , they were filled with admiration and envy , and they ran to the strange little dog and said ,—</p>
     <p>“ Oh , little dog ! what makes your tail so beautifully green ? Pray tell us , that we may make ours green too , for we never saw anything so lovely in all our lives .”</p>
     <p>But the strange little dog laughed and said , “ There are many things greener than my tail . There is the grass down in the meadow ; go and ask that what makes it green , and perhaps it will tell you .”</p>
     <p>So all the little dogs ran down into the meadow where the grass was growing , and they said , “ Oh , grass , grass ! what makes you so green ? Pray tell us , that we may all get green tails , like the tail of the strange little dog .”</p>
     <p>But all the little blades of grass shook their heads , and said , “ We can tell you nothing about that . All we know is that we were down under the ground last winter , and that when we came up this spring , we were all green . You might try that , and perhaps it would make you green , too .”</p>
     <p>So all the little dogs went to work as fast as they could , and dug holes in the ground ; and then they got into them and covered themselves up with earth . But they very soon found they could not breathe ; so they were all obliged to come up again . And when they looked at each other , they saw to their sorrow that they were not green at all , but just the same colours that they were before ,— some black , some brown , and some spotted . Then they all went again to the little dog , and said ,—</p>
     <p>“ Oh , little dog , little dog ! we have been to the grass , and it has not helped us at all . Now , do please tell us what makes your tail so beautifully green , for we never can be happy till ours are like it .”</p>
     <p>But the strange little dog only laughed again and answered , “ My tail is not the only green thing in the world . There are the leaves on the great oak-tree ; they are very green indeed . Go ask them what makes them so , and perhaps they will tell you .”</p>
     <p>So all the little dogs ran as fast as they could to the great oak-tree , and called out to the little leaves , “ Oh , little leaves ! what makes you so beautifully green ? Do tell us , that we may all get green tails , like the tail of the strange little dog .”</p>
     <p>But the leaves all shook their heads , and said , “ We know nothing about that . We came out of our buds last spring , and then we were very pale . But we danced about , and the more we danced the greener we grew . Perhaps if you come up here and dance , you will grow green , too .”</p>
     <p>So all the little dogs climbed up the tree as fast as they could , and tried to dance about on the branches . But they were not fastened on like the little leaves , so they fell down and hurt themselves very much ; and when they got up and looked at each other , they were not any greener than before . So then they all cried bitterly , and they ran once more to the strange little dog , and said , “ Oh , little dog , little dog ! we have tried the way that the leaves told us , and we have only hurt ourselves dreadfully , and have not got green at all . And now , if you do not tell us , we shall die of grief , for we never can rest again till our tails are green .”</p>

     <p>But the strange little dog only laughed more than ever , and said , “ What stupid creatures you are , to think that there is nothing green in the world except my tail . There is the Sea ; he is twenty times as green as my tail . Go and ask him , and he will surely tell you all about it , for he is very wise and knows everything .”</p>
     <p>So all the little dogs ran as fast as they could down to the shore ; and there was the great hungry Sea , prowling up and down , twirling his white moustaches and tossing his white hair , and looking very green and very fierce . The little dogs were very much frightened , but they took courage when they thought of the beautiful green tail , and they said , trembling ,—</p>
     <p>“ Oh , great Sea ! the strange little dog told us that you were wise and knew everything , and that you would tell us how to make our tails green like his .”</p>
     <p>The great Sea smiled , wickedly , and answered , “ Oh , yes , my children , I can tell you ! I am green myself , and I make everything green that touches me . So let me take you in my arms a moment , and you will become beautifully green , just like me .”</p>
     <p>So the great hungry Sea held out his long , green arms , and beckoned to them with his white hands ; and the poor little dogs all shut their eyes and jumped in , and in less than a minute the Sea gobbled them all up , so that not one was left . And there was an end of all the little dogs .</p>
     <p>And the strange little dog went back to the place he came from , with his green tail curled up behind him ; and he was never seen or heard of again .</p>

      <head>HARD TIMES .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ NO CHRISTMAS for us this year !” said Fred , coming out of his father ’ s</l>
       <l n="2">study with his hands in his empty pockets , and a blank look on his face .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ No Christmas ?” cried Edith . “ What do you mean , Fred ?”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Hard times !” said her brother . “ Father says he shall have all he can do to get through the winter , and that we mustn ’ t expect presents , or anything of that kind . Of course it ’ s all right , only ,— it will seem queer , won ’ t it ?”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , no money Christmas !” said Edith , looking relieved . “ Yes , I knew that before . But we can have a merry Christmas , Fred , without money . I mean to have a particularly merry one , and you must help me .”</p>
     <p>“ I should like to know what you can do without any money !”</p>
     <p>“ Wait and see ! and come out into the woods with me this afternoon , that ’ s a good boy !”</p>
     <p>It was about a month before Christmas when this conversation took place ; and all through December there were no busier young people in Woodville than Fred and Edith Brown . They slighted none of their lessons ; but Fred spent a good part of his home time in the barn , with a hammer in his hand and a Latin grammar at his elbow ; while Edith ’ s knitting needles flew as she bent over her history lesson . The day before Christmas , Papa and Mamma were summoned to dine and spend the day with Grandmamma . Mamma rather wondered that the children were not invited , and did not want to go without them ; but their faces grew so direfully long at this suggestion that she saw through the little plot , though Papa did not , and she cheerfully took her shawl and departed , charging Edith to keep up the fire , and Fred to take care of the house .</p>
     <p>When the parents returned in the evening the house was a bower of green . “ Here is one thing that costs nothing !” Edith had said , “ and it is half of a merry Christmas .” So she and Fred had brought great armfuls of fragrant cedar and hemlock , and tall fir saplings , which were set up in every corner , while wreaths hung in the windows , and long garlands festooned fireplace and picture frames . Papa looked very much pleased . “ Why , it is Christmas already !” he said . “ And I thought we should not have any celebration at all this year . You were too bright for me , children .”</p>
     <p>“ It ’ s all Edith , Papa !” said honest Fred .</p>
     <p>“ All but about two-thirds , Papa !” said Edith . “ I could have done nothing without Fred ’ s strong arms .”</p>
     <p>Next morning the sun was out , and the snow sparkled like diamonds in the golden light . “ Here is something else that costs nothing , Edie !” cried Fred , who had entered heart and soul into his sister ’ s idea . “ Sunshine is a pretty good present , isn ’ t it ? And we have the very best article to-day .”</p>
     <p>“ Hurrah !” cried Edith , “ this is glorious . Merry Christmas , boy ! Smiles are another thing , Fred . Let ’ s be sure not to look gloomy for a single minute all day .”</p>
     <p>“ All right !” said Fred . “ I ’ ll grin like the Cheshire cat from morning till night . Now , here ’ s mother ’ s work-table , all ready . It has taken a good polish , hasn ’ t it ?”</p>
     <p>“ Splendid !” cried Edith . “ And here ’ s father ’ s portfolio . Do you recognize the cover , Fred ?”</p>
     <p>“ Looks like that pretty dress you had ever so long ago , when you were a little shaver ,— I mean shaveress !”</p>
     <p>“ Just what it is ! The pieces were folded away all this time , of no use to anybody . And there was enough to make this pretty work-bag for mother , and another like it for Aunt May . And ,— look here , Fred ! Merry Christmas , dear old fellow !”</p>
     <p>Fred looked at the blue and gray toboggan cap with astonishment and delight . “ Oh , Sis , that is a stunner ! But , I say ! you have broken the rule . This wool must have cost you something , and a good deal .”</p>
     <p>“ Not a penny !” rejoined his sister , triumphantly . “ Do you remember that huge old comforter that Aunt Eliza sent me three years ago ? I never could wear it out , though it was just as dear and kind of her to make it for me . That gave me the wool for the cap , and for several other things beside .”</p>
     <p>“ Well , it is a beauty !” said Fred . “ Here ’ s all the present I have for you , and I wish it was a better one .” He produced a birchbark basket , filled with chestnuts and hickories , and was rewarded by a good old-fashioned hug .</p>
     <p>“ As if you could have found anything I should have liked better !” cried Edith . “ Such beauties , too ! Why , you must have picked out every single nut , Fred Brown !”</p>
     <p>“ Something like it !” admitted Fred .</p>
     <p>“ How about those partridges for dinner ?”</p>
     <p>“ They are all ready to put in the oven !” Edith said . “ Mother knows nothing about them yet , but is sighing a little because she has no chicken for us . And you know Mrs. Spicer gave me a jar of mince-meat for the cranberries I brought her . I am a little proud of my pie , Fred !”</p>
     <p>“ Hurrah for you !” said Fred .</p>
     <p>Somehow or other the Browns had never had a merrier Christmas than this one of the hard winter . Edith said it was all the sunshine and the green boughs ; Fred said it was all Edith ; but Mr. and Mrs. Brown , as they sat by the cheerful hearth , and watched the chestnuts roasting , and listened to the merry young voices , gave reverent thanks for their treasure of love , and felt that they were rich in spite of the hard times .</p>

       <l n="4">When you go to fairy-land , turn to the left after you enter the gate ,</l>

       <l n="6">This is what I did when I went there , and you shall hear what I saw .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>On entering the house , I found myself in a large hall hung with gold and silver paper , and glittering with an incomparable brightness . Here were hundreds of little cupids with tiny wings , who were running and flying about , as busy as bees .</p>
     <p>One was carrying a roll of gold paper as big as himself ; another was painting beautiful flowers on white paper ; others were making paper lace . But all seemed to be helping and waiting on a person who sat by a huge table at the farther end of the hall , and this person I soon found to be Saint Valentine himself .</p>
     <p>He was a young man , and very handsome . He was dressed in sky-blue velvet , embroidered with gold , and had great fat pearls for buttons . He seemed as busy as the rest , and merely nodded and smiled when he saw me , and called out ,—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Number Three Shears ,</l>
       <l n="2">Approach , my dears !”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I heard a queer , sharp voice at my elbow , saying , “ Now , then , by your leave !” and turning , saw at my elbow an enormous pair of shears , walking about on two legs , and looking as proud as you please .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Dear Number Threes ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">Snip-snap ! snip-snap ! went the shears , and there lay a million little</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="6">Then the Saint cried ,—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="7">“ Bring me some hearts ,</l>
       <l n="8">And flaming darts !”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>and a dozen cupids came up , dragging a great basket full of hearts , and carrying bundles of darts under their arms . Quick as lightning , Saint Valentine took a couple of hearts out of the basket , clapped them on a sheet of paper , stuck a dart into them , flung a wreath of flowers round them , then , thump ! a great stamp came down on the paper , and out of it came a lovely valentine .</p>
     <p>That was quick work ! in five minutes , I should think , five hundred valentines were turned out . I stood looking on in delight .</p>
     <p>Suddenly the Saint called out ,—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ A big one let us now begin ,</l>
       <l n="2">And let us put the lady in !”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>At first I did not know what he meant : but he took an enormous sheet , and after showering hearts and roses and cupids upon it , turned to me , and said , sweetly ,—</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Now if you will venture in it ,</l>

       <l n="4">Now Robby was nearly six years old , and a person of great importance .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="5">“ I don ’ t mean that !” said little Bobby , who was not yet four . “ I</l>
       <l n="6">mean , what is our birfday ? Is it good to eat ?”</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="9">“ No !” said Bobby , opening his mouth . “ I neber saw one .”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ You don ’ t see them !” said Robby , in a patronizing tone , “ you have them ! It is the day you were born , and you have a party and presents , and a birthday cake with frosting , and your name on it in pink letters , and candy and oranges , and a gold dollar with Grandmamma ’ s love to her dear little boy . Do you really mean that you never had one , Bobby Bell ?”</p>
     <p>Little Bobby looked very grave . “ Perhaps I wasn ’ t born !” he said . “ I ’ s going to ask Mamma .” So he trotted in to his mother .</p>
     <p>“ Mamma ,” he said , “ was I born ?”</p>
     <p>Mamma looked at him a moment in mute surprise . “ Were you born , dear ?” she repeated . “ Yes , certainly you were born . Why do you ask me that , little boy ?”</p>
     <p>Bobby ’ s lip began to quiver , and his blue eyes filled with tears . “ Den why ,— why don ’ t I have birfdays ?” he asked .</p>
     <p>Mamma looked very sorry . “ Dear ! dear !” she said . “ Now who has been telling my leap year boy about birthdays ? Come and sit in Mamma ’ s lap and tell me all about it , and then I will tell you all about it .”</p>
     <p>So Bobby climbed up into Mamma ’ s lap and hid his face in her dress , and sobbed out his little story about frosted cake and pink letters , and gold dollars with Grandmamma ’ s love to her dear little boy . “ And I neber — I neber had any !” he said , piteously .</p>
     <p>Then Mamma told Bobby a funny little story . It was about the years , and it told how they came along , one after another , and how each year had just the same number of days in it .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Three — hundred — and sixty-five !</l>
       <l n="2">So many days I ’ ve been alive .</l>
       <l n="3">Storm and shine , and sorrow and cheer ,</l>
       <l n="4">Really , there never was such a year !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">That is what each one says before it puts on its nightcap and goes to</l>
       <l n="6">sleep .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>But every fourth year there comes one who is bigger than the rest . He has one day more , and he is very proud of it , and holds his head very high , and says ,—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Three — hundred — and sixty-six !</l>
       <l n="2">One more day for frolicsome tricks .</l>
       <l n="3">One day more for work and for play .</l>
       <l n="4">Look at me ! look at me ! One MORE DAY !! !”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ And so four years ago ,” said Mamma , “ there came one of these extra days , and it was the very best day that any year ever brought , for on that day my Bobby was born ! Think of that !”</p>
     <p>Bobby laughed and clapped his little fat hands .</p>
     <p>“ And so ,” continued Mamma , “ of course my Bobby couldn ’ t have another birthday till another long year came round , with another extra day . And now ,— whisper , Bobby ! now the long year has come , and next Friday is your birthday , dear , and you are going to have — oh ! but I mustn ’ t tell !”</p>
     <p>Mamma laughed and shook her head , and didn ’ t tell any more , but her eyes told a great deal ; and that was all Bobby wanted , for he was very fond of surprises and secrets .</p>
     <p>He hugged Mamma , and then he hugged himself , and then he went and hugged the kitten , and told her all about it , and what he thought he was going to have .</p>
     <p>Well , and it all came true , and a great deal more ; for Bobby had the finest birthday that ever any little boy had , or any little girl , either . In fact , it was so very fine that I couldn ’ t possibly write about it in common black ink on white paper . I should have to take silver paper and gold ink ; and I cannot do that , so I shall have to stop now . Isn ’ t that too bad ?</p>

     <p>THE STORY OF THE CRIMSON CRAB .</p>
     <p>THE Crimson Crab was to be married to the Eldest Frog . The wedding guests were assembled on the great water-lily leaf , in their best dresses and best spirits . There were lizards and water-beetles , dragon-flies and butterflies ,— in fact , all the best people of the neighbourhood . The musicians , young frogs of remarkable talent , were stationed with their instruments in the pink buds of the lily ; in the largest blossom the bride was completing her toilet . But she wept as she polished her shining claws , and her feelers shook with grief ; for she did not wish to marry the Eldest Frog . He was gray and grizzly , had no voice save a dismal croak , and was known to have an odious temper . The Crimson Crab thought of the gallant young Green Frog , whom she had met at the Pollywogs ’ Ball . How handsome he was ! She had danced nearly every dance with him , and he had pressed her claw tenderly , and whispered sweet words in her ear . Then , the next evening , he came and sang beneath her window ; ah , how he sang ! When the song was over he leaped lightly upon the window-sill , poured out his tale of love , and gained her promise to be his bride . Ah , moment of rapture ! She thrilled even now with the recollection of it . But he vanished , and — she had never seen him since . She was told that he had disappeared , had probably gone to the Muskrat War , and been killed in battle .</p>
     <p>Alone she sat and wept , till her stern father came and told her that she was to be the bride of the Eldest Frog . Vain were her tears , vain her entreaties . Preparations for the wedding were at once begun , the fine clothes were ordered , and now the fatal day was come .</p>
     <p>“ Alas !” cried the Crimson Crab , “ why am I beautiful ? Why does this lovely carmine mantle in my shining shell ? If I were a plain green crab the Eldest Frog would not have sought me out , and I might still sit in my lonely bower and weep for my lost love .”</p>
     <p>At this moment her father ’ s summons came , and she was forced to dry her tears .</p>
     <p>“ Console yourself , noble Lady !” cried her faithful Attendant Lizard . “ See the beautiful gifts your bridegroom has sent you . A girdle of pearls ! a mantle of glittering fish-scales ! webs of gossamer , the finest that ever were seen ! Never was bride so richly decked . So generous a bridegroom as the Eldest Frog is sure to make a kind husband .”</p>
     <p>But the bride only sighed the more , and sadly took her way toward the great leaf , whereon the wedding guests were assembled .</p>
     <p>The Eldest Frog was dressed in his best . His speckled coat was new , and his yellow breeches fitted to perfection ; but for all that he was old and ugly . He leered at the bride with his goggle-eyes , and grinned till the two ends of his mouth nearly met behind .</p>
     <p>“ Croak ! croak !” he said , laying his hand on his heart . “ Ah ! the fair bride ! Ah ! the lovely Crimson ! What happiness to win the love of such an exquisite creature !” He held out his withered hand , and advanced a step or two ; but at the same instant a voice was heard , crying , “ Villain ! do not dare to touch her !” and leaping across the lily-leaf , his eyes flashing fire , his bulrush spear in his hand , came the Green Frog .</p>
     <p>With one thrust he sent the Eldest Frog sprawling on the floor . Then , while all the company looked on aghast , he caught the Crimson Crab in his arms , and hailed her as his bride . “ This villain lay in wait for me ,” he cried , “ and captured me unawares the very night when last I saw thee , my own . For weeks I have lain fast bound , hand and foot , in a dungeon deep under the mud . To-day I was set free by a faithful Horned Pout , whom I had formerly befriended . Fly with me , my bright , my beautiful ! My home among the reeds is lowly , but love will make it rich . Away ! away !” He seized the slender claw of the Crimson Crab ; and before her father could prevent it , the two had leaped from the leaf , and were scuttling swiftly through the clear water .</p>
     <p>All the guests followed ,— that is , all who could swim ,— to see what would become of the venturous young couple . The old Crab went into his hole and sulked ; while as for the Eldest Frog , he just lay on his back where his rival had thrown him , gasping and gurgling , and nobody took any notice of him , till at last a fat brown duck came along , and — gobbled him up !</p>

     <p>THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS .</p>
     <p>ONCE upon a time there were some children , and once upon a time there were some ducks . It was upon the same time , too , and they all lived together in one house . That was funny , wasn ’ t it ?</p>
     <p>And there were two reasons for it . In the first place , it was so cold where they lived that the ducks could not stay out of doors , except in summer ; and in the second place , the good man of the house , the children ’ s father , was so poor that he could not afford to have a separate house for the ducks .</p>
     <p>Indeed , there were only three rooms in the house . One was the kitchen , which was parlor and dining-room and sitting-room as well , and one was the children ’ s room , and the third was the parents ’ room . So there they all lived together , and they were very sociable . The names of the children were Greta , Minna , Lisa , Carl and Baby Fritz . The names of the ducks were Red-top , Waggle-tail , Gobbler and Spottle-toe ; and the children were all good , but the ducks were all naughty , as you shall hear .</p>
     <p>The father had made a nice wooden box for the ducks , and this was always filled with hay and kept beside the great porcelain stove in winter , so that the pets might be warm . But were they grateful for this kindness ? Not a bit of it . They were always getting out of their box and poking their bills into all sorts of places where they had no business to be . You might find Waggle-tail inside the mother ’ s Sunday cap , and Gobbler tasting the soup on the table , and Red-top and Spottle-toe pulling the baby ’ s doll to pieces . These were things that happened every day . And , indeed , what else can be expected , when one keeps one ’ s ducks in the kitchen ? But one day something very much worse than all this came .</p>
     <p>The mother was ill , so ill that she was obliged to stay in bed and send for the doctor , and that was something very unusual . The doctor came and gave her a box of pills , telling her to take one every day until she was better . He told her to put her feet in a hot mustard-bath , as that would draw the pain down from her head ; then he patted the children , and mounting his old gray pony , rode away again .</p>
     <p>Well , the mother took her pill , and then closed her eyes for a short nap , laying the pill-box down on the low stool beside the bed . Presently Greta , the eldest daughter , came in with the hot foot-bath , and seeing her mother asleep , set it down softly and went out again to get the warm shawl that the good woman would need when she sat up .</p>
     <p>Now , it happened that she left the door open , and as this was what the four ducks had been waiting for all day , they immediately waddled into the mother ’ s room . Poking about in their usual way , they soon found the box of pills , and supposing them to be something particularly nice , they gobbled them all up in the twinkling of an eye . Now , you know that pills are not apt to be nice , and these pills were very particularly nasty , as the ducks soon found out .</p>
     <p>“ What ’ s this ?” said Gobbler .</p>
     <p>“ Ugh ! quack ! ugh ! What is it ?” exclaimed Red-top .</p>
     <p>Waggle-tail had swallowed four pills , and his feelings were too deep for words . His one thought was “ something to drink !” and seeing the foot-bath , he plunged his bill in and took a good draught of the hot mustard and water .</p>
     <p>Oh , then , what a clamour arose ! The other ducks had hastened to follow his example , and now they were all screaming and sputtering and flapping their wings in a way that was dreadful to hear . The poor mother woke up in a fright ; Greta and all the children came rushing in , followed by the dog ; finally the father came , armed with a heavy stick , and the terrified ducks were driven out of doors , where they sat , shivering , on the doorstep , declaring that they would never eat or drink anything again .</p>

     <head>POOR BONNY .</head>
     <head>A TRUE STORY .</head>
     <p>BONNY was only six years old when it happened . He went to the mill , one day , with his uncle , riding in front of him on the old gray mare , while the bags of corn hung over on each side .</p>
     <p>While Uncle Allen talked with the miller , Bonny ran about , peeping here and there ; and at last he strayed off into the pasture to see the red calf with the three spots on its nose . He was gone so long that Uncle Allen thought he had run away home , so he rode off with two bags of flour instead of the corn .</p>
     <p>Bonny was rather frightened when he found he must go home alone through the woods , a distance of three miles , but he was a sturdy little fellow , and would not let the miller know that he was afraid .</p>
     <p>Off he trudged , with his hands in his pockets , whistling the merriest tune he knew , to keep his courage up ,—“ Tra la lira la !” Very gayly it sounded through the bare woods , for it was early spring , and the leaves were only just beginning to break out of their woolly coverings . The red squirrels came out of their holes to look at him , and the little wood-mice sat and chattered at the doors of their houses . Bonny was used to these little creatures , and only whistled louder when he saw them ; but presently he came to something that made him stop whistling and open his mouth very wide indeed with surprise .</p>
     <p>On the stump of a fallen tree sat a great bird with mottled feathers , which spread around and over the stump . It was a wild turkey , Bonny knew , for Uncle Allen had told him just what they looked like , though he had never seen one .</p>
     <p>When the turkey saw him , she rose up for a moment , and he saw that she was sitting on a nest full of brown eggs . Then she settled down again , folded her wings over her treasure , and glared fiercely at the intruder .</p>
     <p>Bonny stood quite still for some time , wondering what he should do . He wanted the eggs ,— not all , but just a few , to show Uncle Allen . But the turkey was very large and very fierce-looking , with her glaring , yellow eyes and her sharp beak ; and Bonny was only six years old .</p>
     <p>On the whole , he thought the wisest plan would be to go straight home and tell Uncle Allen about it ; and then they would come together and drive the turkey away , and get a few of the beautiful mottled egg .</p>
     <p>Full of his new idea , the little fellow ran on , and finally reached home before dark . But here a sad disappointment awaited him , for Uncle Allen — Bonny had no father or mother , and lived with his uncle — would not believe that he had seen a wild turkey at all .</p>
     <p>“ Pooh ! pooh !” he said . “ Nonsense , my lad ! you saw a partridge ; or it might be a hen that had stolen a nest , as the saying is . There are no wild turkeys about here that ever I heard of . Get your supper now , and go to bed , like a good little lad . We have had a fine worry about you , thinking you were lost .”</p>
     <p>Bonny knew it was a wild turkey that he had seen , and he was very unhappy because his story was only half believed .</p>
     <p>“ If I could only have got an egg !” he said to himself , over and over . “ If I had only one egg to show , they would know that I am right . But I know it ! I do ! I do !” He ate his supper , and went to bed with his head full of the wild turkey , but he was so tired that he fell asleep in spite of himself .</p>
     <p>It seemed as if Bonny had only been asleep five minutes when something struck him very hard on the head , and woke him up . He cried out , and opened his eyes in a great fright . Where was he ? Why was he so cold ? Why were his feet wet ?</p>
     <p>At first the child was bewildered with fright and amazement ; but when he came to himself , he found that he was standing in the midst of a wood , alone , barefooted , clad only in his little flannel nightgown , in the dead of night .</p>
     <p>Poor Bonny ! poor little lad ! And what was he holding up in his nightgown , holding tight with both hands ? He let go his hold , and down fell — the wild turkey ’ s eggs !</p>
     <p>The child had walked there in his sleep , and had found the bird gone , or else driven her away , he never could know which . As he raised his head after gathering up the eggs , a branch must have struck him on the head and waked him .</p>
     <p>But oh , to get home ! It was so cold , so wet ! He shivered with fear , as well as with the chill ; but this time he would not go back empty-handed . Surely , the eggs could not be all broken ?</p>
     <p>No , here was one whole one ! Clasp it tight , little Bonny , and run ! Follow your own little footprints , pit-pat , pit-pat , back through the dark woods ,— the moon shining through the trees , and making just enough light for you to see your way ,— across the meadow , up the lane and then ,— oh ! then scamper , run ! rush over the home-field , home ! home at last !</p>
     <p>Pit-pat , softly , up the back stairs , after closing the door , which he found swinging wide open , and the little shivering figure crept into its little bed , cuddled down under the bedclothes and lay as still as a mouse .</p>
     <p>Great was the outcry in the morning when Bonny told his story .</p>
     <p>“ Pooh ! pooh ! nonsense !” cried Uncle Allen .</p>
     <p>But there was the turkey ’ s egg , and there were the little muddy footprints at the back door and up the stairs .</p>
     <p>Then Uncle Allen followed the tracks , and went himself across the field and down the lane and over the meadow and through the wood . And when he came to the nest on the stump and the broken eggs , with the print of the little bare feet close by , he said , “ Well , well ! I declare ! now , I do !”</p>
     <p>And he went home and gave Bonny a big orange and ten cents and his old jackknife . But Aunt Lucy kept him in bed till noon , and made him drink hot lemonade every hour to take out the cold ; and he had the kitten to play with , and Grandma ’ s spectacles , and he didn ’ t catch cold , after all .</p>

      <head>THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER .</head>
      <head>ONCE upon a time there lived , in a little straw hut , a poor cheese-maker and his wife . They made good cheeses , and sold them whenever they could ; but they lived in a lonely spot , and few people passed by that way , so that they made but a slender living . Now it chanced one day that when the good wife came to count the cheeses she found that there were six missing , although she had not sold any or given them away .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">So she said to her husband ,—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">“ Some thief has stolen six cheeses in the night .”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="3">“ Good !” said the husband .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="4">“ Bad !” said the wife .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Good , I tell you !” cried the husband . “ We will watch to-night and catch the thief , and to-morrow we will take him before the judge and ask that he be forced to pay us twice the value of the cheeses .”</p>
     <p>“ Good !” said the wife . “ What a clever fellow you are !”</p>
     <p>“ Oh ! I have not a pumpkin on my shoulders !” said the husband , chuckling .</p>
     <p>Accordingly , the husband and wife concealed themselves under the bed the next night , and watched to see what would happen . About midnight the door opened softly , and in came a large brown monkey . He looked all about , and seeing no one , he went to the cheese cupboard , took three of the finest cheeses , and made off . The wife was for following him , but the husband said , “ No ! let us wait and see if he comes again .”</p>
     <p>So they waited , and sure enough the monkey returned in a few minutes , and taking three more cheeses went off again . This time the man followed him . Holding the cheeses carefully in his arms , the monkey took his way through the woods till he came to the mouth of a cave , into which he ran . The cheese-maker slipped noiselessly after him . They went through a dark , winding passage , which led to a vaulted chamber hollowed in the solid rock . Here the monkey entered , while the man concealed himself behind a point of rock and peeped after him . The room was full of monkeys ; and at the farther end sat the Monkey King , on a throne made of a huge mass of gold . The cheese-maker stared at that , for he had never seen such a sight . When the Monkey King saw the cheese , he howled with delight , seized the largest one , and gobbled it up .</p>
     <p>When the cheese-maker saw that , he turned about and went home again , for he needed to see no more , having a head on his shoulders , and not a pumpkin .</p>
     <p>“ How now ?” asked his wife . “ You come back without the cheeses ?”</p>
     <p>“ Hold your tongue , good wife !” he said . “ Knowledge is better than cheese .”</p>
     <p>“ Truly !” said the wife , scornfully . “ It must be a fine knowledge to be worth six of my best cheeses .”</p>
     <p>The next night the man hid himself behind the door of the hut , and when the monkey-thief appeared , he sprang out and caught him by his long tail .</p>
     <p>“ Here , wife !” he cried , “ bring me your shears , that I may cut off this fellow ’ s tail for a rope to beat him with .”</p>
     <p>“ Ai , ai !” screamed the monkey . “ Do not cut off my handsome tail ! Spare me , and I will give you whatever you wish .”</p>
     <p>“ Do you mean it ?” asked the cheese-maker , giving the tail a twist .</p>
     <p>“ Ai , ai !” said the monkey , “ I swear it , upon my honour !”</p>
     <p>“ Then ,” said the cheese-maker , “ go and bring me a lump of gold from the king ’ s throne as big as my fist , and you shall have your freedom and a cheese besides .”</p>
     <p>The monkey , glad to escape so easily , hastened away , and soon returned with the lump of gold .</p>
     <p>“ What do you want of this yellow stuff ?” he asked . “ It is only fit to make chairs of .”</p>
     <p>“ Well , I may want to make a chair some day ,” replied the cheese-maker . “ The door will be locked after this ,” he added ; “ but whenever your master wants cheese , you know how to get it .”</p>
     <p>It happened , in this way , that the cheese-maker and his wife grew very rich ; for the monkeys constantly came to buy cheese , and they always paid for it with heavy lumps of gold . Soon the straw hut disappeared , and in its stead rose a stately house of stone , with gardens and terraces about it . The cheese-maker wore a velvet coat , and his wife flaunted about in a satin gown ; but still they never failed to make their cheeses twice a week .</p>
     <p>“ Why do you still make cheese ?” asked the fine visitors who came to see them , rolling in gilded coaches . But the cheese-maker had one answer for them all : “ Because I have a head on my shoulders , and not a pumpkin .”</p>

     <p>THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS .</p>
     <p>ONCE upon a time there was a Person who did not like cats . She did not like dogs , either , but she never said anything about that , because the Big Master and the two Little Masters and the four Little Mistresses were all very fond of dogs , and liked to have them lie round under everybody ’ s feet and get white hairs all over everybody ’ s clothes , and take up the whole hearth-rug and run away with the roast beef , and bark to be let out and then howl to be let in , and shake themselves when they were wet , and do all the things that dogs do ,— they liked all these things , so the Person who did not like cats never dared to say a word .</p>
     <p>But nobody cared very much about cats — except when they were little downy kittens , and they will not stay kittens !— save Maggie , the cook ; so the Person felt free to speak her mind , and said she would not have any cats in the house . And after she had said that , these things happened :</p>
     <p>One day a kitten belonging to the neighbour ’ s little boy came into the kitchen , and refused to go out again . The little boy was sent for , and he came and took the kitten home .</p>
     <p>Next day it came again , and was taken home again . And so it went on for a week , till every one in the house was tired out with carrying that kitten home , and the kitten ’ s little boy cried and thought it was too bad . It was .</p>
     <p>But the kitten was very happy , and Maggie , the cook , said she “ couldn ’ t let the crathur starve ,” so it stayed ; and pretty soon it was not a kitten any more , but a cat , and it had kittens of its own , one of which was given to the little boy .</p>
     <p>Now the Person who did not like cats said the other kittens must be taken away in a bag ; but all the Little Masters and Mistresses cried out , and said ,—</p>
     <p>“ Oh , Mamma !” “ Please , Mamma , the dear , sweet little things !” “ See their little paws !” “ See their dear little noses !” “ Hear them squeal !” “ We must keep this one , Mamma !” “ We can ’ t possibly part with that one , Mamma !” “ Oh , Mamma !” “ Dear Mamma !” “ Feel this one ’ s little back !” and so on , and so on .</p>
     <p>So the Person said that they might keep the one which they all thought the prettiest , and that the others must go away in a bag ; but while they were deciding , the kittens grew up and became cats . So then the bag was not big enough to hold them , and they stayed , partly for that reason , and partly because they were all so ugly that no one could tell which was the least ugly .</p>
     <p>Now , one day , the man at the livery stable , where the Master kept his horse , said that he wanted a cat , because the rats were giving him a great deal of trouble in his hay-loft . So the Master took the ugliest cat of all , which was really ugly enough to frighten the crows , and he put her in a basket , and took her away to the stable , and everybody was glad .</p>
     <p>But three days after , as the Person was weeding the flowerbed , she heard a loud squeal of joy , and felt something rubbing against her back ; she turned round , and there was the Ugliest Cat , purring and squeaking , and seeming just as glad to get back as if she were perfectly beautiful , and as if everybody loved her to distraction . She was sent to the stable again , but this time she came back the very next day , because she had found out the way . So she stayed .</p>
     <p>But after that , things went worse than ever . The Person went out to walk , and a cat followed her home , and would not go away , and would come in ! and Maggie , the cook , said she “ couldn ’ t see the crathur starve ,” so she fed it and it stayed . And on Thanksgiving Day a miserable hungry kitten came to the door and begged to be let in , and nobody could refuse to give it a Thanksgiving dinner , so it came in , and it stayed .</p>
     <p>And now the Person who does not like eats has nothing but cats about her all the time . They lie on the stairs and trip her up in the dark . If she takes up a clothes-basket , out rolls a kitten . If she gets the little sleigh to take the Littlest Mistress to ride , out jumps a cat . Wherever she goes , whatever she does , she sees a dirty white cat , or a rusty black cat , or a faded yellow cat , or a dingy tabby cat , or a hideous tortoise-shell beast , which is the Ugliest Cat of all . And the Person would like the children to tell her what is to be done about it !</p>
