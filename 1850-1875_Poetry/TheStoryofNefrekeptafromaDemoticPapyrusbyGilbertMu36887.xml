    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The original of this tale is in Demotic Egyptian , in prose , on a fragmentary papyrus dated ‘ the first month of winter , in the fifteenth year ’ of some king unnamed . Palaeographical evidence suggests some date about 100 B. C . My own education has been neglected in the matter of Demotic , and I know the tale only from the literal translation which accompanies the text in Dr. Griffith 's Stories of the High Priests of Memphis . In that form , however , it so fascinated me that I presently found myself , to the neglect of more urgent duties , putting it into English verse and filling up the gaps in the narrative . I have tried to preserve the style and often the exact words of the original , as rendered by Dr. Griffith , but in other respects temptations have been great and I have not resisted them .</p>
    <p n="2">The names present some difficulties . In Demotic , if I understand aright , the vowels are not written and the consonants often do not mean what they seem to mean . The hero 's name is spelt , roughly speaking , N ( ‘ y ) - nfr-k ’ - Pth , the phantom lady 's Ty-bwbwe ; the priest 's is written Stne , but was probably pronounced , so Dr. Griffith tells me , S [) e ] ton or S [) e ] tan .</p>
    <p n="3">While doing the verses I was constantly reminded of certain Egyptian illuminations by Miss Florence Kingsford , now Mrs. Sydney Cockerell , which I had seen some years ago , and she has been so kind as to provide the book with a frontispiece and tail-piece .</p>
    <p n="4">Those who desire further information about Setne will find it in the introduction to Dr. Griffith 's learned and delightful book ( Clarendon Press , 1900 ) .</p>

    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="6">SETNE KHAMUAS , son of RAMESES , High Priest of PTAH , beneath his garden trees Dwelt with his wife and children ; wise was he In Books of power and ancient Masteries .</p>
    <p n="7">And much he pondered on a tale they told , How NEFREKEPTA , dead in days of old , Held still the Book of HERMES which is THOTH Hid in his tomb , and never loosed his hold .</p>
    <p n="8">And longing for that Book so pierced him through He called to him his brother AN-HERRU , The son of MENKH-ART , saying : ‘ Brother mine , Be with me in a deed I have to do . ’</p>
    <p n="9">And he said : ‘ I am with thee till my doom Find me . ’ And SETNE said : ‘ I seek the tomb Of NEFREKEPTA dead , and take the Book , The Book of THOTH hid in its inmost room . ’</p>
    <p n="10">That night they found the tomb , and AN-HERRU Stayed at the door , but SETNE passing through On seven great doors and seven windings spake His spells , and found the room ; and all was true .</p>
    <p n="11">For there lay NEFREKEPTA in his pride , The Book beneath his head ; and at his side The ghosts sate of a woman and a boy , Shadows beside the dead ; and SETNE cried :</p>
    <p n="12">‘ Ye throned Shadows , whosoe'er ye be , And thou , dead PHARAOH , tombed in majesty , All hail ! I , SETNE , scribe and Priest of PTAH , Command thy Book be rendered up to me ,</p>
    <p n="13">The Book of THOTH which lies beneath thy head . ’ Then never word nor sign came from the dead , But the two Shadows lifted up their arms Lamenting , and the woman swift outspread</p>
    <p n="14">Her hand to save the Book , and cried : ‘ Aha ! SETNE KHAMUAS , is the will of RA Not yet fulfilled upon us ? This is I , AHURE of the race of MERNAB-PTAH .</p>

   <p>Ahure 's Story</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Therefore give ear , and let the Book of Gold</l>
     <l n="2">Tempt thee no more , till all my tale be told .—</l>
     <l n="3">It happened in the days of MERNAB-PTAH ,</l>
     <l n="4">The long days , when the King was very old ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And had no son nor daughter ; in their room</l>
     <l n="6">A son 's son and a daughter 's daughter , whom</l>
     <l n="7">Thou seest , NEFREKEPTA the Good Scribe ,</l>
     <l n="8">And me who watch beside him in this tomb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And PHARAOH mused and spake : ‘ Go near and far ,</l>
     <l n="10">Bring me the lordliest of my chiefs of war</l>
     <l n="11">With all their daughters and their sons , to make</l>
     <l n="12">Feast on the third day ; call me all that are . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">So PHARAOH spake ; but lo , exceedingly</l>
     <l n="14">Did I love NEFREKEPTA and he me .</l>
     <l n="15">And much I feared that PHARAOH at that feast</l>
     <l n="16">Would take some youth and maid of high degree ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">A war-lord 's daughter and a war-lord 's son ,</l>
     <l n="18">And fast bind NEFREKEPTA to the one ,</l>
     <l n="19">And me to the other ; so his race would grow ,</l>
     <l n="20">But we two meet no more beneath the sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Now PHARAOH 'S ancient Steward loved me well ,</l>
     <l n="22">And NEFREKEPTA too ; and it befell ,</l>
     <l n="23">One day he watched me and the second day</l>
     <l n="24">He spoke : ‘ AHURE , surely I can spell</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">A story that is written in four eyes .</l>
     <l n="26">Thou lovest NEFREKEPTA and likewise</l>
     <l n="27">He loveth thee . ’ And I cried out : ‘ O friend ,</l>
     <l n="28">Speak unto PHARAOH quick , ere this day dies !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Pray that he give me to my cousin straight ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nor seek to make us two live separate . ’</l>
     <l n="31">And he said : ‘ I will speak ; for so the law</l>
     <l n="32">Commandeth , by long ages consecrate ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">The King 's sons wed the daughters of the King . ’</l>
     <l n="34">Then all my heart was like a water-spring</l>
     <l n="35">Leaping ; and soon he went and soon returned</l>
     <l n="36">Sad , and reported of his counselling :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">‘ I spake to PHARAOH , saying : “ Lord , may life</l>
     <l n="38">Like RA 'S be thine and glory in all strife !</l>
     <l n="39">Is it not meet that NEFREKEPTA take</l>
     <l n="40">By ancient rule AHURE to his wife ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Let PHARAOH wed with PHARAOH ; so shall pure</l>
     <l n="42">PHARAOH be born :— the rule doth still endure . ”</l>
     <l n="43">And PHARAOH spoke not , but his brow grew dark</l>
     <l n="44">With trouble ; and I said : “ O King , for sure</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">Thou hast some grief ; say what doth vex thy brow ? ”</l>
     <l n="46">And PHARAOH said : “ None vexeth me but thou .</l>
     <l n="47">I have but two , and if those two be wed</l>
     <l n="48">All PHARAOH 'S fruit is hanging on one bough .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">Nay , search and find me one great war-lord 's son ,</l>
     <l n="50">Another war-lord 's daughter . With the one</l>
     <l n="51">And other let these children twain be wed .</l>
     <l n="52">So PHARAOH 'S line on many threads shall run . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">Next day the hours passed and the feast was set</l>
     <l n="54">Before the King ; and I was called ere yet</l>
     <l n="55">The Lords came . And I stood before the King</l>
     <l n="56">Not as of old , my heart being desolate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">And PHARAOH spake : ‘ AHURE , was it thou</l>
     <l n="58">Didst send that message that hath made my brow</l>
     <l n="59">Troubled , that with thy brother thou wouldst wed ? ’</l>
     <l n="60">And I said : ‘ Hath the King not made a vow ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">A war-lord 's daughter and a war-lord 's son —</l>
     <l n="62">Behold us !— Let my brother take the one ,</l>
     <l n="63">And let the other take AHURE ; so</l>
     <l n="64">Shall PHARAOH 'S race be great beneath the sun . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">And there I laughed ; and PHARAOH laughed again ,</l>
     <l n="66">And called the Steward of the King 's domain :</l>
     <l n="67">‘ Steward , this night to NEFREKEPTA 'S house</l>
     <l n="68">The maid AHURE take and all her train ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">And all things beautiful go with her there . ’</l>
     <l n="70">Thus I to NEFREKEPTA 'S house did fare ,</l>
     <l n="71">And PHARAOH sent wrought silver and fine gold ,</l>
     <l n="72">And PHARAOH 'S servants stood about my chair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">And NEFREKEPTA took with me delight ,</l>
     <l n="74">And feasted PHARAOH 'S servants ; and that night</l>
     <l n="75">Was made our marriage , and we knew great joy ,</l>
     <l n="76">And never , never , failed I in his sight ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">For each his fellow loved exceedingly .</l>
     <l n="78">And when my time of bearing came to be</l>
     <l n="79">I bore the son who lieth in this tomb ,</l>
     <l n="80">MERAB ; a name in the Kings ’ Book is he .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="81">The Book of Thoth</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="82">And thus it fell , that of all things on earth</l>
     <l n="83">My brother NEFREKEPTA most of worth</l>
     <l n="84">Did hold the wisdom that in Books is writ .</l>
     <l n="85">The tablets of the House of Death and Birth ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="86">And all that on the temple walls is said ,</l>
     <l n="87">And all the lore of the Kings ’ Tombs he read ,</l>
     <l n="88">And ever walked in Memphis on the Hill</l>
     <l n="89">Of Kings , and stored the wisdom of the dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="90">Now one day was a high procession sent</l>
     <l n="91">To PTAH 'S great house ; and NEFREKEPTA went</l>
     <l n="92">And walked therein ; right slow he walked , and read</l>
     <l n="93">All that was writ on wall and pediment .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="94">And , watching him , behold , an aged Priest</l>
     <l n="95">Laughed . And he said : ‘ God 's mercy be increased !</l>
     <l n="96">Why laughest thou at me ? ’ And he : ‘ I laugh</l>
     <l n="97">At no man , not the greatest nor the least ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="98">I laugh to think how thou shalt laugh anon ,</l>
     <l n="99">When that which no man 's eye hath looked upon ,</l>
     <l n="100">The secret Book of HERMES which is THOTH ,</l>
     <l n="101">Is opened to thine hand and called thine own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="102">He wrote it , and the Gods before his face</l>
     <l n="103">Fled .— And it lies . . . If ever word of grace</l>
     <l n="104">Or spell of power thou need , come then to me</l>
     <l n="105">And speak . Thou shalt be guided to the place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="106">Two leaves it hath , on which two sorceries</l>
     <l n="107">Are written . If thou read the first of these ,</l>
     <l n="108">Thou shalt enchant the earth , the clouds above ,</l>
     <l n="109">The underworld , the mountains and the seas ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="110">And all the words that winged things may say ,</l>
     <l n="111">And creeping things , shall be made thine that day ;</l>
     <l n="112">Yea , thou shalt see all fishes in the deep</l>
     <l n="113">And God 's power guiding each upon his way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="114">And if thou read the second , though there lies</l>
     <l n="115">Above thee all AMENTI , thou shalt rise</l>
     <l n="116">And take thy shape again , and see the MOON</l>
     <l n="117">And RA and all the children of the skies . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="118">And NEFREKEPTA cried : ‘ O Priest and King !</l>
     <l n="119">I bless thee . Tell me every gorgeous thing</l>
     <l n="120">Thy soul desireth , they shall all be thine ,</l>
     <l n="121">Wilt thou but guide my steps to that great spring . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="122">Then smiled the Priest : ‘ My Prince , so let it be !</l>
     <l n="123">Send me an hundred bars of silver , free</l>
     <l n="124">Of all fault , for my burial when I die ;</l>
     <l n="125">And two full priesthoods give me without fee . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="126">And NEFREKEPTA called a youth , and bade</l>
     <l n="127">An hundred bars of silver pure be made ,</l>
     <l n="128">And two new priesthoods named to THOTH and PTAH ,</l>
     <l n="129">And sealed him priest to PTAH and THOTH unpaid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="130">Then the man spoke : ‘ The Book of THOTH doth rest</l>
     <l n="131">In Coptos Sea , hid in a golden chest ;</l>
     <l n="132">The gold doth lie in silver ; that in wrought</l>
     <l n="133">Ebon and ivory , fitted nest in nest ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="134">That in sweet cedar ; that in bronze doth lie ;</l>
     <l n="135">The bronze in iron . ‘ Tis knotted with a ply</l>
     <l n="136">Of endless Snake ; and round it for one league</l>
     <l n="137">Are scorpion , asp , and worm to make men die . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="138">He spoke , and NEFREKEPTA no more knew</l>
     <l n="139">What place he stood in nor what breath he drew ,</l>
     <l n="140">But forth he hied him in great joy , and caught</l>
     <l n="141">My hand , and all this tale he told me true ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="142">And cried : ‘ South , South to Coptos ! None shall stay</l>
     <l n="143">Our going . ’ But I turned from him away</l>
     <l n="144">And found that aged Priest and said : ‘ Thou Priest ,</l>
     <l n="145">May AMUN curse thee for thy words this day !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="146">The Book of THOTH , the serpents and the sea !</l>
     <l n="147">Most bitter striving thou hast made for me ,</l>
     <l n="148">And bitter watching till my lord 's return ;</l>
     <l n="149">False art thou , and thy South all cruelty . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="150">And much I prayed my brother not to sail</l>
     <l n="151">To Coptos , but my prayer might not avail ,</l>
     <l n="152">For straight to PHARAOH 'S throne he went , and spake</l>
     <l n="153">To PHARAOH of the Priest and all his tale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="154">And PHARAOH said : ‘ What wilt thou I should do ? ’</l>
     <l n="155">‘ Give me thy ship of pleasure and its crew , ’</l>
     <l n="156">He said : ‘ and with me let AHURE sail</l>
     <l n="157">To find the Book , and the boy MERAB too . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="158">So PHARAOH 'S pleasure-ship was brought , and all</l>
     <l n="159">Its crew ; and southward in high festival</l>
     <l n="160">We sailed to Coptos ; and the news went forth</l>
     <l n="161">Before us , and the folk stood on the wall .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="162">The Priests of ISIS and HARPOCRATES</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="43">
     <l n="166">They led us to their Temple in a line ;</l>
     <l n="167">And NEFREKEPTA gave ox , goose , and wine ,</l>
     <l n="168">And brought to ISIS and HARPOCRATES</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="44">
     <l n="170">A temple beautiful exceedingly</l>
