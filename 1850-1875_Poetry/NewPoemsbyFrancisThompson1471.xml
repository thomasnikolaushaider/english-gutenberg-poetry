    <docTitle><titlePart>NEW POEMS , By Francis Thompson . Dedication to Coventry Patmore . Lo , my book thinks to look Time 's leaguer down , Under the banner of your spread renown ! Or if these levies of impuissant rhyme Fall to the overthrow of assaulting Time , Yet this one page shall fend oblivious shame , Armed with your crested and prevailing Name . Note .— This dedication was written while the dear friend and great Poet to whom it was addressed yet lived . It is left as he saw it — the last verses of mine that were ever to pass under his eyes .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <l n="37">How harder than the heart of woman is</l>
     <l n="38">The immortal cruelty</l>
     <l n="39">Of the high goddesses .</l>
     <l n="40">True is his witness who doth witness this ,</l>
     <l n="41">Whose gaze too early fell —</l>
     <l n="42">Nor thence shall turn ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nor in those fires shall cease to weep and burn —</l>
     <l n="44">Upon her ruinous eyes and ineludible .</l>

     <l n="2">Immeasurable Earth !</l>
     <l n="3">Through the loud vast and populacy of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="4">Tempested with gold schools of ponderous orbs ,</l>
     <l n="5">That cleav'st with deep-revolting harmonies</l>
     <l n="6">Passage perpetual , and behind thee draw'st</l>
     <l n="7">A furrow sweet , a cometary wake</l>
     <l n="8">Of trailing music ! What large effluence ,</l>
     <l n="9">Not sole the cloudy sighing of thy seas ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor thy blue-coifing air , encases thee</l>
     <l n="11">From prying of the stars , and the broad shafts</l>
     <l n="12">Of thrusting sunlight tempers ? For , dropped near</l>
     <l n="13">From my remov-ed tour in the serene</l>
     <l n="14">Of utmost contemplation , I scent lives .</l>
     <l n="15">This is the efflux of thy rocks and fields ,</l>
     <l n="16">And wind-cuffed forestage , and the souls of men ,</l>
     <l n="17">And aura of all treaders over thee ;</l>
     <l n="18">A sentient exhalation , wherein close</l>
     <l n="19">The odorous lives of many-throated flowers ,</l>
     <l n="20">And each thing 's mettle effused ; that so thou wear'st ,</l>
     <l n="21">Even like a breather on a frosty morn ,</l>
     <l n="22">Thy proper suspiration . For I know ,</l>
     <l n="23">Albeit , with custom-dulled perceivingness ,</l>
     <l n="24">Nestled against thy breast , my sense not take</l>
     <l n="25">The breathings of thy nostrils , there 's no tree ,</l>
     <l n="26">No grain of dust , nor no cold-seeming stone ,</l>
     <l n="27">But wears a fume of its circumfluous self .</l>
     <l n="28">Thine own life and the lives of all that live ,</l>
     <l n="29">The issue of thy loins ,</l>
     <l n="30">Is this thy gaberdine ,</l>
     <l n="31">Wherein thou walkest through thy large demesne</l>
     <l n="32">And sphery pleasances ,—</l>
     <l n="33">Amazing the unstal-ed eyes of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="34">And us that still a precious seeing have</l>
     <l n="35">Behind this dim and mortal jelly .</l>
     <l n="36">Ah !</l>
     <l n="37">If not in all too late and frozen a day</l>
     <l n="38">I come in rearward of the throats of song ,</l>
     <l n="39">Unto the deaf sense of the ag-ed year</l>
     <l n="40">Singing with doom upon me ; yet give heed !</l>
     <l n="41">One poet with sick pinion , that still feels</l>
     <l n="42">Breath through the Orient gateways closing fast ,</l>
     <l n="43">Fast closing t'ward the undelighted night !</l>

     <l n="66">Thy tedious state which irked my ignorant years ,</l>
     <l n="67">Thy winter-watches , suckling of the grain ,</l>
     <l n="68">Severe premeditation taciturn</l>
     <l n="69">Upon the brooded Summer , thy chill cares ,</l>
     <l n="70">And all thy ministries majestical ,</l>
     <l n="71">To sport with me , thy darling . Thought I not</l>

     <l n="74">My fellow-gamester , appanage of mine arms ?</l>
     <l n="75">Then what wild Dionysia I , young Bacchanal ,</l>
     <l n="76">Danced in thy lap ! Ah for thy gravity !</l>

     <l n="78">Rocked to Eastward , rocked to Westward ,</l>
     <l n="79">Even with the shifted</l>
     <l n="80">Poise and footing of my thought !</l>
     <l n="81">I brake through thy doors of sunset ,</l>
     <l n="82">Ran before the hooves of sunrise ,</l>
     <l n="83">Shook thy matron tresses down in fancies</l>
     <l n="84">Wild and wilful</l>
     <l n="85">As a poet 's hand could twine them ;</l>
     <l n="86">Caught in my fantasy 's crystal chalice</l>
     <l n="87">The Bow , as its cataract of colours</l>
     <l n="88">Plashed to thee downward ;</l>
     <l n="89">Then when thy circuit swung to nightward ,</l>
     <l n="90">Night the abhorr-ed , night was a new dawning ,</l>
     <l n="91">Celestial dawning</l>
     <l n="92">Over the ultimate marges of the soul ;</l>
     <l n="93">Dusk grew turbulent with fire before me ,</l>
     <l n="94">And like a windy arras waved with dreams .</l>
     <l n="95">Sleep I took not for my bedfellow ,</l>
     <l n="96">Who could waken</l>

     <l n="107">Most Hermes-like , did keep</l>
     <l n="108">My vital and resilient path , and felt</l>

     <l n="116">With sad and doubtful questioning , when first</l>
     <l n="117">Thou speak'st to us as men : like sons who hear</l>
     <l n="118">Newly their mother 's history , unthought</l>
     <l n="119">Before , and say — ‘ She is not as we dreamed :</l>
     <l n="120">Ah me ! we are beguiled ! ’ What art thou , then ,</l>
     <l n="121">That art not our conceiving ? Art thou not</l>
     <l n="122">Too old for thy young children ? Or perchance ,</l>
     <l n="123">Keep'st thou a youth perpetual-burnishable</l>
     <l n="124">Beyond thy sons decrepit ? It is long</l>
     <l n="125">Since Time was first a fledgling ;</l>
     <l n="126">Yet thou may'st be but as a pendant bulla</l>
     <l n="127">Against his stripling bosom swung . Alack !</l>
     <l n="128">For that we seem indeed</l>
     <l n="129">To have slipped the world 's great leaping-time , and come</l>
     <l n="130">Upon thy pinched and dozing days : these weeds ,</l>
     <l n="131">These corporal leavings , thou not cast'st us new ,</l>
     <l n="132">Fresh from thy craftship , like the lilies ’ coats ,</l>
     <l n="133">But foist'st us off</l>
     <l n="134">With hasty tarnished piecings negligent ,</l>
     <l n="135">Snippets and waste</l>
     <l n="136">From old ancestral wearings ,</l>
     <l n="137">That have seen sorrier usage ; remainder-flesh</l>
     <l n="138">After our father 's surfeits ; nay with chinks ,</l>
     <l n="139">Some of us , that if speech may have free leave</l>
     <l n="140">Our souls go out at elbows . We are sad</l>
     <l n="141">With more than our sires ’ heaviness , and with</l>
     <l n="142">More than their weakness weak ; we shall not be</l>
     <l n="143">Mighty with all their mightiness , nor shall not</l>
     <l n="144">Rejoice with all their joy . Ay , Mother ! Mother !</l>
     <l n="145">What is this Man , thy darling kissed and cuffed ,</l>
     <l n="146">Thou lustingly engender'st ,</l>
     <l n="147">To sweat , and make his brag , and rot ,</l>
     <l n="148">Crowned with all honour and all shamefulness ?</l>
     <l n="149">From nightly towers</l>
     <l n="150">He dogs the secret footsteps of the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="151">Sifts in his hands the stars , weighs them as gold-dust ,</l>
     <l n="152">And yet is he successive unto nothing</l>
     <l n="153">But patrimony of a little mould ,</l>
     <l n="154">And entail of four planks . Thou hast made his mouth</l>
     <l n="155">Avid of all dominion and all mightiness ,</l>
     <l n="156">All sorrow , all delight , all topless grandeurs ,</l>
     <l n="157">All beauty , and all starry majesties ,</l>
     <l n="158">And dim transtellar things ;— even that it may ,</l>
     <l n="159">Filled in the ending with a puff of dust ,</l>
     <l n="160">Confess — ‘ It is enough . ’ The world left empty</l>
     <l n="161">What that poor mouthful crams . His heart is builded</l>
     <l n="162">For pride , for potency , infinity ,</l>
     <l n="163">All heights , all deeps , and all immensities ,</l>
     <l n="164">Arrased with purple like the house of kings ,—</l>
     <l n="165">To stall the grey-rat , and the carrion-worm</l>
     <l n="166">Statelily lodge . Mother of mysteries !</l>
     <l n="167">Sayer of dark sayings in a thousand tongues ,</l>
     <l n="168">Who bringest forth no saying yet so dark</l>
     <l n="169">As we ourselves , thy darkest ! We the young ,</l>

     <l n="171">At last confront thee , and ourselves in thee ,</l>
     <l n="172">And wake disgarmented of glory : as one</l>

     <l n="174">On the mount adverse , crowned with westering rays ,</l>
     <l n="175">The golden sun , and they two brotherly</l>

     <l n="178">To the dull vale , his Godhead peels from him</l>
     <l n="179">Till he can scarcely spurn the pebble —</l>
     <l n="180">For nothingness of new-found mortality —</l>
     <l n="181">That mutinies against his gall-ed foot .</l>

     <l n="183">With all around the valleys growing grave ,</l>
     <l n="184">And known things changed and strange ; but he holds on ,</l>

   <p>( The metre of the second of these two translations is an experiment . The splendid fourteen-syllable metre of Chapman I have treated after the manner of Drydenian rhyming heroics ; with the occasional triplet , and even the occasional Alexandrine , represented by a line of eight accents — a treatment which can well extend , I believe , the majestic resources of the metre . )</p>

     <l n="9">Like clotting blood , and shrinks to find it cold ,</l>
     <l n="10">And when she sees its lapse and nerveless fall</l>
     <l n="11">Clasps her fans , while her sobs ooze through the webb-ed gold .</l>
     <l n="12">Thereat all weep together , and their tears</l>
     <l n="13">Make lights like shivered moonlight on long waters .</l>
     <l n="14">Have peace , O piteous daughters !</l>
     <l n="15">He shall not wake more through the mortal years ,</l>
     <l n="16">Nor comfort come to my soul widow-ed ,</l>
     <l n="17">Nor breath to your wild wings ; for Love is dead !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="18">I slew , that moan for him : he lifted me</l>
     <l n="19">Above myself , and that I might not be</l>
     <l n="20">Less than myself , need was that he should die ;</l>
     <l n="21">Since Love that first did wing , now clogged me from the sky .</l>
     <l n="22">Yet lofty Love being dead thus passeth base —</l>
     <l n="23">There is a soul of nobleness which stays ,</l>
     <l n="24">The spectre of the rose : be comforted ,</l>
     <l n="25">Songs , for the dust that dims his sacred head !</l>
     <l n="26">The days draw on too dark for Song or Love ;</l>
     <l n="27">O peace , my songs , nor stir ye any wing !</l>
     <l n="28">For lo , the thunder hushing all the grove ,</l>
     <l n="29">And did Love live , not even Love could sing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="30">And , Lady , thus I dare to say ,</l>
     <l n="31">Not all with you is passed away !</l>
     <l n="32">For your love taught me this : -  ‘ tis Love 's true praise</l>
     <l n="33">To be , not staff , but writ of worthy days ;</l>
     <l n="34">And that high worth in love unfortunate</l>
     <l n="35">Should still remain it learned in love elate .</l>
     <l n="36">Beyond your star , still , still the stars are bright ;</l>
     <l n="37">Beyond your highness , still I follow height ;</l>
     <l n="38">Sole I go forth , yet still to my sad view ,</l>
     <l n="39">Beyond your trueness , Lady , Truth stands true .</l>
     <l n="40">This wisdom sings my song with last firm breath ,</l>
     <l n="41">Caught from the twisted lore of Love and Death ,</l>
     <l n="42">The strange inwoven harmony that wakes</l>
     <l n="43">From Pallas ’ straying locks twined with her aegis-snakes .</l>
     <l n="44">‘ On him the unpetitioned heavens descend ,</l>
     <l n="45">Who heaven on earth proposes not for end ;</l>
     <l n="46">The perilous and celestial excess</l>
     <l n="47">Taking with peace , lacking with thankfulness .</l>
     <l n="48">Bliss in extreme befits thee not , until</l>
     <l n="49">Thou'rt not extreme in bliss ; be equal still :</l>
     <l n="50">Sweets to be granted think thy self unmeet</l>
     <l n="51">Till thou have learned to hold sweet not too sweet . ’</l>
     <l n="52">This thing not far is he from wise in art</l>
     <l n="53">Who teacheth ; nor who doth , from wise in heart .</l>

     <l n="1">Go , songs , for ended is our brief , sweet play ;</l>
     <l n="2">Go , children of swift joy and tardy sorrow :</l>
     <l n="3">And some are sung , and that was yesterday ,</l>
     <l n="4">And some unsung , and that may be to-morrow .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Go forth ; and if it be o'er stony way ,</l>
     <l n="6">Old joy can lend what newer grief must borrow :</l>
     <l n="7">And it was sweet , and that was yesterday ,</l>
     <l n="8">And sweet is sweet , though purchas-ed with sorrow .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Go , songs , and come not back from your far way :</l>
     <l n="10">And if men ask you why ye smile and sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="11">Tell them ye grieve , for your hearts know To-day ,</l>
     <l n="12">Tell them ye smile , for your eyes know To-morrow .</l>
