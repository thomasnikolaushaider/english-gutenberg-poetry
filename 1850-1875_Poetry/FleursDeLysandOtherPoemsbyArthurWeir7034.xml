    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The name FLEURS DE LYS has been chosen for the Canadian Poems in the early portion of this book , because the scenes and incidents they describe belong to the Monarchial , or Fleur de Lys , period of France in Canada . The royal crest during the seventeenth century is depicted upon the cover .</p>
    <p n="2">Many of these poems have already appeared in the columns of the Carnival and Jubilee Star , the Toronto Week , the University Gazette , and the Montreal Gazette , as well as in the Daily and Weekly Star , and it is the kindly reception which they met with that has led the author to publish them in this more permanent form .</p>
    <p n="3">Some of the poems were written at twenty , and the latest at twenty - three , so that the author hopes the critics will consider this volume rather as a bud than as a flower , and will criticize it with the view to aiding him to avoid faults in the future rather than to censuring him for errors of the present and past .</p>
    <p n="4">To Mr. George Murray , of this city , the author is deeply indebted for encouragement when encouragement was most needed , and for much valuable assistance in the selection and revision of these verses for publication .</p>
    <p n="5">It is hoped that the notes at the end of this book will throw sufficient light upon the verses to make them perfectly intelligible to the reader .</p>
    <p n="6">December , 1st , 1887 .</p>

     <l n="1">Sailor William is dead . And now</l>
     <l n="2">Toll the great bells disconsolate .</l>
     <l n="3">Let the maiden have time for tears</l>
     <l n="4">Ere you set on her gentle brow</l>
     <l n="5">England 's glittering crown of state .</l>
     <l n="6">Heavy burden for eighteen years .</l>
     <l n="7">Grant the maiden some weeping space</l>
     <l n="8">Ere on her youthful brow you place</l>
     <l n="9">England 's crown .</l>
     <l n="10">Once her stately head it presses ,</l>
     <l n="11">Fifty years it must rest on her tresses</l>
     <l n="12">Till their brown</l>
     <l n="13">Turns to white beneath King Time 's caresses —</l>
     <l n="14">Grant her weeping space .</l>

      <l n="15">Set the crown on the maiden 's brow ,</l>
      <l n="16">And silence the bells disconsolate .</l>
      <l n="17">Peal ! Ye loud joy-bells , now ;</l>
      <l n="18">Over city and wold let your echoes reverberate .</l>
      <l n="19">Peal ! for the crowning of smiles and the death of tears ,</l>
      <l n="20">Peal ! for the crowning of hopes and the death of fears ,</l>
      <l n="21">Peal ! for a Queen who shall rule us for fifty years .</l>
      <l n="22">The maiden is crowned with her glorious crown ,</l>
      <l n="23">Heavy with care ;</l>
      <l n="24">Yet it shall never burden her down</l>
      <l n="25">Into despair .</l>
      <l n="26">We will watch over her with our love ,</l>
      <l n="27">And our loyalty prove .</l>
      <l n="28">We will bear , each , his share</l>
      <l n="29">Of the worry , grief , and pain</l>
      <l n="30">That may seek to mar her reign .</l>

      <l n="34">Ye mountains ! give the laughing bells reply .</l>

      <l n="37">In melody !</l>
      <l n="38">Mark how the billows of the mighty sea</l>
      <l n="39">Toss their white arms in glee ,</l>
      <l n="40">And race along the strand ,</l>
      <l n="41">Joining their voices with the symphony !</l>
      <l n="42">Our Queen has yielded to love .</l>

      <l n="48">Of a great life-work done .</l>
      <l n="49">Death rules this changing earth ,</l>
      <l n="50">Through royal halls he stalks ,</l>
      <l n="51">And with an awful mirth</l>
      <l n="52">Man 's noblest efforts mocks .</l>
      <l n="53">He stills the busy brain ,</l>
      <l n="54">Tears loving souls apart ,</l>

      <l n="56">A Queen with empty heart .</l>
      <l n="57">Upon her lonely throne</l>

      <l n="59">For him who , once her own ,</l>
      <l n="60">Now wed to heaven sleeps .</l>
      <l n="61">Albert has fallen , conquered by Death 's dart ,</l>
      <l n="62">A shadow lies across her anguished heart .</l>
      <l n="63">She dwells in loneliness that none can gauge ;</l>

      <l n="65">She trembles and her soul would fain depart ,</l>

    <head>THE CAPTURED FLAG .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Loudly roared the English cannon , loudly thundered back our own ,</l>
     <l n="2">Pouring down a hail of iron from their battlements of stone ,</l>
     <l n="3">Giving Frontenac 's proud message to the clustered British ships :</l>
     <l n="4">“ I will answer your commander only by my cannons ’ lips . ”</l>
     <l n="5">Through the sulphurous smoke below us , on the Admiral 's ship of war ,</l>
     <l n="6">Faintly gleamed the British ensign , as through cloudwrack gleams a</l>
     <l n="7">star ,</l>
     <l n="8">And above our noble fortress , on Cape Diamond 's rugged crest —</l>
     <l n="9">Like a crown upon a monarch , like an eagle in its nest —</l>
     <l n="10">Streamed our silken flag emblazoned with the royal fleur de lys ,</l>
     <l n="11">Flinging down a proud defiance to the rulers of the sea .</l>
     <l n="12">As we saw it waving proudly , and beheld the crest it bore ,</l>
     <l n="13">Fiercely throbbed our hearts within us , and with bitter words we swore ,</l>
     <l n="14">While the azure sky was reeling at the thunder of our guns ,</l>
     <l n="15">We would strike that standard never , while Old France had gallant sons .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">Long and fiercely raged the struggle , oft our foes had sought to land ,</l>
     <l n="17">But with shot and steel we met them , met and drove them from the</l>
     <l n="18">strand ,</l>
     <l n="19">Though they owned them not defeated , and the stately Union Jack ,</l>
     <l n="20">Streaming from the slender topmast , seemed to wave them proudly back .</l>
     <l n="21">Louder rose the din of combat , thicker rolled the battle smoke ,</l>
     <l n="22">Through whose murky folds the crimson tongues of thundering cannon</l>
     <l n="23">broke ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the ensign sank and floated in the smoke-clouds on the breeze ,</l>
     <l n="25">As a wounded , fluttering sea-bird floats upon the stormy seas .</l>
     <l n="26">While we looked upon it sinking , rising through the sea of smoke ,</l>
     <l n="27">Lo ! it shook , and bending downwards , as a tree beneath a stroke ,</l>
     <l n="28">Hung one moment o'er the river , then precipitously fell</l>
     <l n="29">Like proud Lucifer descending from high heaven into hell .</l>
     <l n="30">As we saw it flutter downwards , till it reached the eager wave ,</l>
     <l n="31">Not Cape Diamond 's loudest echo could have matched the cheer we gave ;</l>
     <l n="32">Yet the English , still undaunted , sent an answering echo back :</l>
     <l n="33">Though their flag had fallen conquered , still their fury did not slack ,</l>
     <l n="34">And with louder voice their cannon to our cannonade replied ,</l>
     <l n="35">As their tattered ensign drifted slowly shoreward with the tide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="36">There was one who saw it floating , and within his heart of fire ,</l>
     <l n="37">Beating in a Frenchman 's bosom , rose at once a fierce desire ,</l>
     <l n="38">That the riven flag thus resting on the broad St. Lawrence tide</l>
     <l n="39">Should , for years to come , betoken how France humbled England 's pride .</l>
     <l n="40">As the stag leaps down the mountain , with the baying hounds in chase ,</l>
     <l n="41">So the hero , swift descending , sought Cape Diamond 's rugged base ,</l>
     <l n="42">And within the water , whitened by the bullets ’ deadly hail ,</l>
     <l n="43">Springing , swam towards the ensign with a stroke that could not fail .</l>
     <l n="44">From the shore and from the fortress we looked on with bated breath ,</l>
     <l n="45">For around him closer , closer , fell the messengers of death ,</l>
     <l n="46">And as nearer , ever nearer , to the floating flag he drew ,</l>
     <l n="47">Thicker round his head undaunted still the English bullets flew .</l>
     <l n="48">He has reached and seized the trophy . Ah ! what cheering rent the skies ,</l>
     <l n="49">Mingled with deep English curses , as he shoreward brought his prize !</l>
     <l n="50">Slowly , slowly , almost sinking , still he struggled to the land ,</l>
     <l n="51">And we hurried down to meet him , as he reached the welcome strand .</l>
     <l n="52">Proudly up the rock we bore him , with the flag that he had won ,</l>
     <l n="53">And that night the English vessels left us with the setting sun .</l>

    <head>PÈRE BROSSE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He had been with the Indians all the day ,</l>
     <l n="2">But sat with us at eve ,</l>
     <l n="3">Chatting and laughing in his genial way ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till came the hour to leave ;</l>
     <l n="5">And then he rose , we with him , for we loved</l>
     <l n="6">Our good old parish priest ,</l>
     <l n="7">Who all his lifetime in our midst had moved</l>
     <l n="8">At death-bed and at feast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">He raised his hand for silence , and each head</l>
     <l n="10">Was bowed as though in prayer ,</l>
     <l n="11">Expectant of his blessing , but instead</l>
     <l n="12">He stood in silence there .</l>
     <l n="13">Thrice he essayed to speak , and thrice in vain ,</l>
     <l n="14">And then his voice came back ,</l>
     <l n="15">Vibrating in a deep , triumphal strain</l>
     <l n="16">That it was wont to lack .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">“ My children , we must part . My task is done .</l>
     <l n="18">God calls me to His rest ,</l>
     <l n="19">And though my labors seem scarce yet begun ,</l>
     <l n="20">Surely He knoweth best .</l>
     <l n="21">I have grown old in laboring for Him ,</l>
     <l n="22">My hair with age is white ,</l>
     <l n="23">My footsteps feeble , and my eyesight dim —</l>
     <l n="24">But all shall change to-night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">“ When strikes the hour of twelve , my weary soul</l>
     <l n="26">On earth shall cease to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="27">As sign of which the chapel bell shall toll</l>
     <l n="28">Its slow funereal knell .</l>
     <l n="29">Then seek me , if you will , and you shall find</l>
     <l n="30">Upon the altar stair</l>
     <l n="31">The prison-house my soul will leave behind ,</l>
     <l n="32">Kneeling as though in prayer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">“ Seek , then , Père Compain , on the Isle aux Coudres ,</l>
     <l n="34">Nor fear the rising gale ,</l>
     <l n="35">For Heaven will guide you through the angry flood ,</l>
     <l n="36">And it shall not prevail .</l>
     <l n="37">He will be waiting for you on the sands ,</l>
     <l n="38">Amid the morning gloom ,</l>
     <l n="39">To be your comrade , and , with kindly hands</l>
     <l n="40">Consign me to my tomb . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">He ceased , and left us , as though turned to stone ,</l>
     <l n="42">All motionless and still :</l>
     <l n="43">And faintly fell his footsteps , as alone</l>
     <l n="44">He slowly climbed the hill .</l>
     <l n="45">Then we awoke , and all so wondrous seemed ,</l>
     <l n="46">His words so strange at best ,</l>
     <l n="47">We almost fancied we had slept and dreamed</l>
     <l n="48">That he had been our guest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">We turned unto our merriment anew ,</l>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">EXPLANATORY NOTES .</p>
    <p n="2">THE CAPTURED FLAG .</p>
    <p n="3">The incident described in these verses took place during the unsuccessful siege of Quebec by Admiral Sir William Phipps , in 1690 . Admiral Phipps , after capturing Port Royal , now Annapolis , Nova Scotia , sailed up the St. Lawrence , in October , arriving at Quebec on the 5th . Frontenac , then Governor of New France , was taken almost by surprise , yet , when summoned to surrender , he haughtily refused to do so , using the words attributed to him in the ballad . Phipps was beaten off , leaving with the French the cannon of his troops and this flag , which had been shot away , and which was picked up by a Canadian , who swam out after it . A medal was struck in France , and a church erected in Quebec , in honor of this victory .</p>
    <p n="4">PÈRE BROSSE .</p>
    <p n="5">A full account of this pious legend will be found in Mr. J. Lemoine 's Chronicles of the St. Lawrence , pages 242 , 243 , and 244 . Father de La Brosse was , at the time of his death , a priest at Tadousac , at the mouth of the Saguenay , and about seventy miles below the Isle aux Coudres , where he celebrated the first mass , in 1765 . He died at midnight , on the 11th April , 1782 , and , so says the legend , his death was preceded and followed by miraculous occurrences . He is said to have foretold it , and to have bidden his people seek Père Compain on the Isle aux Coudres , and bring him to perform the funeral offices . There would be a storm , which they were not to heed , for he guaranteed them against harm , and they were to find Père Compain awaiting them . All came true : Père Brosse was found dead at midnight with his head on the altar of his chapel ; the men set out , and though the waves rolled mountains high on every side , there was peace where their canoe floated . They found Père Compain awaiting them , for he had been supernaturally informed of his colleague 's death , and he went with them to Tadousac . All the bells of the missions where Père Brosse had labored are said to have been rung without hands that night .</p>
    <p n="6">L'ORDRE DE BON TEMPS .</p>
    <p n="7">This company of Bon Vivants was formed in 1606 , during the sojourn of Champlain and de Poutrincourt at Port Royal . An account of its organization and doings will be found in Parkman 's Champlain and His Associates , Chapter iv .</p>
    <p n="8">CHAMPLAIN .</p>
    <p n="9">This poem is a resumé of the life of him whom Parkman calls “ The Æneas of a destined people . ” “ Yon fair town ” alludes to Quebec , which Champlain founded July 3rd , 1608 . His defiance of Admiral Kirkt took place in 1628 , and was successful for a season , but a second summons from Kirkt next summer led to the first surrender of Canada to England . Champlain died on Christmas Day , 1635 , after twenty-seven years of labor for the country in which his name can never be forgotten .</p>
    <p n="10">THE PRIEST AND THE MINISTER .</p>
    <p n="11">In the opening paragraphs of the third chapter of Parkman 's Champlain and His Associates , will be found an account , of which these verses are little more than a paraphrase . When de Monts was commissioned to settle New France , the Roman Catholic clergy insisted that they be given charge of the souls of the heathen in the new land . De Monts was , himself , a Huguenot , and brought his own ministers with him , so that the ship that sailed to Acadia in 1604 bore with it clergy of both sects . This was the cause of ceaseless quarrels . “ I have seen our curé and the minister , ” says Champlain , “ fall to with their fists on questions of faith . I cannot say which had the more pluck , or which hit the harder ; but I know the minister complained to the Sieur de Monts that he had been beaten . ” Sagard , the Franciscan friar , gives an account of the death of two of the disputants and of their burial in one grave . I have taken the liberty of making them the central figures of the dispute , though , actually , they were subordinates .</p>
    <p n="12">PILOT .</p>
    <p n="13">Pilot was one of a number of dogs sent from France to Montreal shortly after its foundation , in order to assist the brave colonists in their warfare with the savages . She and her offspring were invaluable in detecting ambuscades . An account of her useful life will be found in Parkman 's Jesuits in North America , chap . xviii .</p>
    <p n="14">THE SECRET OF THE SAGUENAY .</p>
    <p n="15">Although one legend , and , perhaps , the best substantiated one , asserts that Roberval was assassinated in Paris , there is another to the effect that , fired by the recitals of Cartier of untold wealth to be found in the Saguenay district , he sailed up the river of that name , and was never heard of again . This legend will be found in the Illustrated History of Canada .</p>
    <p n="16">JULES ’ LETTER .</p>
    <p n="17">The date of this letter would be about 1670 . From 1665 to 1673 , bachelors in Canada underwent a martyrdom of great severity , and Jules ’ fear lest he find himself married in spite of himself is hardly an exaggeration . From 1665 to 1673 , about one thousand girls were sent out from France to find husbands in Canada . Each couple married was given an ox , a cow , a pair of swine , a pair of fowls , two barrels of salted meat , and eleven crowns in money . Girls under sixteen and youths under twenty were given twenty livres when they married , and were encouraged to marry at fourteen and eighteen respectively . To such an extent was this rage for marriage carried that , it is said , a widow was married before her first husband 's body had been consigned to the grave . Large bounties were paid to parents having from ten to fifteen children , and the slightest sign of courtship between the unmarried officers and ladies of Quebec and Montreal , was chronicled in official documents and transmitted to France . For further particulars , the reader is referred to Parkman 's The Old Regime in Canada , chapter xiii .</p>
    <p n="18">THE OAK .</p>
    <p n="19">The two villages referred to are Hochelaga and Ville Marie , now Montreal . The latter place was founded by Maisonneuve in 1642 . In Sir William Dawson 's Fossil Men is a picture of Hochelaga as seen by Cartier , with an oak tree near it . This oak is sketched from one in the McGill University grounds , and it needs but a little stretch of the imagination to consider them identical , though actually this is not so . The poem traces the history of Montreal from its foundation up to the present time . Jacques Cartier 's visit was made in October , 1535 , when he was well received by the Hochelagans . When Champlain came , in 1611 , Hochelaga had disappeared . The reference to the flood occurs again in “ Nelson 's Appeal for Maisonneuve . ” The incident took place in 1642 , and Maisonneuve actually fulfilled his vow and bore a heavy cross to the mountain top , where it was planted . Dollard , with seventeen Frenchmen and fifty Indians , by heroic self-sacrifice , in 1660 , saved Canada from destruction by the Iroquois . Vaudreuil surrendered Canada to the English on September 8th , 1760 . He had been driven to Montreal , and was surrounded by 17 , 000 men , under General Amherst . The Americans took Montreal in 1775 , and were defeated at Chateauguay , October 26th , 1813 , and at Chrysler 's Farm , November 11th , of the same year . In both cases , the Canadians were greatly outnumbered .</p>
    <p n="20">NELSON 'S APPEAL FOR MAISONNEUVE .</p>
    <p n="21">This is supposed to be spoken by Horatio , Lord Nelson , whose statue , standing on Jacques Cartier Square , by the magnificent river St. Lawrence , is , with the exception of the bronze image of our Queen , the only one in the city of Montreal . In five years , Montreal will see its 250th anniversary . Shall it be said that we have forgotten its founder , when that day comes ? The pages of Parkman may again be referred to for an explanation of any points in this poem . The Jesuits in North America , chapter xv ., contains a long account of the foundation of Montreal , and subsequent pages chronicle the life of Maisonneuve .</p>
    <p n="22">THE SPIRIT WIFE .</p>
    <p n="23">This is a free paraphrase of a prose tale by Israel G. Owen .</p>
    <p n="24">LACHINE .</p>
    <p n="25">Misled by the information given him by the Indians , and also by the size of the St. Lawrence , Jacques Cartier [ La Salle ? ] gave to Lachine its present name , thinking that by it a western passage to China was possible .

    <p n="26">DE SALABERRY AT CHATEAUGUAY .</p>
    <p n="27">During the Anglo-American War of 1812 , the brunt of the fighting fell upon the Canadian Volunteers , and one of their most notable exploits is that which I have striven to portray in this poem . Hearing of the advance of the Americans , De Salaberry , with 400 Voltigeurs , entrenched himself at the junction of the Chateauguay and Outarde rivers , not many miles from Montreal . On the morning of October the 26th , this little band of heroes was attacked by 3 , 500 Americans . In spite of the most determined bravery , the Canadians would have been overcome by sheer force of numbers , but for the ruse described in the poem , assisted by a rapid discharge of musketry from new ambuscades . The Americans withdrew , and Lower Canada was saved .</p>
    <p n="28">TENNYSON .</p>
    <p n="29">This poem was written shortly after the appearance of “ Sixty Years After , ” by Lord Tennyson , and while the critics on both sides of the Atlantic were , for the most part , tearing him to pieces .</p>
    <p n="30">A GREATER THAN HE .</p>
    <p n="31">Glooskap is to the Penobscot Indians much what Hiawatha was to those of Longfellow 's wonderful poem . He is supposed to be making arrows in a long hut , waiting for the time , when , like Barbarossa , he shall come to save his countrymen . The only time that he was defeated was when he strove to conquer a baby . The story will be found in C. G. Leland 's Algonquin Legends .</p>
    <p n="32">DAUNTLESS .</p>
    <p n="33">This is a true episode of the Hungarian rebellion of 1849 . The young man 's name was Ferenz Renyi , and he died recently in the asylum at Buda-Pesth . Haynau was attacked in Barclay 's Brewery , London , in 1850 , for cruelties of this kind , and barely escaped with his life from the infuriated employes .</p>
