   <head>THE LAW OF THE YUKON</head>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">This is the law of the Yukon , and ever she makes it plain :</l>
     <l n="3">“ Send not your foolish and feeble ; send me your strong and your sane .</l>
     <l n="4">Strong for the red rage of battle ; sane , for I harry them sore ;</l>
     <l n="5">Send me men girt for the combat , men who are grit to the core ;</l>
     <l n="6">Swift as the panther in triumph , fierce as the bear in defeat ,</l>
     <l n="7">Sired of a bulldog parent , steeled in the furnace heat .</l>
     <l n="8">Send me the best of your breeding , lend me your chosen ones ;</l>
     <l n="9">Them will I take to my bosom , them will I call my sons ;</l>
     <l n="10">Them will I gild with my treasure , them will I glut with my meat ;</l>
     <l n="11">But the others — the misfits , the failures — I trample under my feet .</l>
     <l n="12">Dissolute , damned , and despairful , crippled and palsied and slain ,</l>
     <l n="13">Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters — Go ! take back your spawn</l>
     <l n="14">again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">“ Wild and wide are my borders , stern as death is my sway ;</l>
     <l n="16">From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a</l>
     <l n="17">day ;</l>
     <l n="18">Hugging my mighty treasure , waiting for man to come :</l>
     <l n="19">Till he swept like a turbid torrent , and after him swept — the scum .</l>
     <l n="20">The pallid pimp of the dead-line , the enervate of the pen ,</l>
     <l n="21">One by one I weeded them out , for all that I sought was — Men .</l>
     <l n="22">One by one I dismayed them , frighting them sore with my glooms ;</l>
     <l n="23">One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms .</l>
     <l n="24">Drowned them like rats in my rivers , starved them like curs on my</l>
     <l n="25">plains ,</l>
     <l n="26">Rotted the flesh that was left them , poisoned the blood in their veins ;</l>
     <l n="27">Burst with my winter upon them , searing forever their sight ,</l>
     <l n="28">Lashed them with fungus-white faces , whimpering wild in the night ;</l>
     <l n="29">Staggering blind through the storm-whirl , stumbling mad through the</l>
     <l n="30">snow ,</l>
     <l n="31">Frozen stiff in the ice pack , brittle and bent like a bow ;</l>
     <l n="32">Featureless , formless , forsaken , scented by wolves in their flight ,</l>
     <l n="33">Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white ;</l>
     <l n="34">Gnawing the black crust of failure , searching the pit of despair ,</l>
     <l n="35">Crooking the toe in the trigger , trying to patter a prayer ;</l>
     <l n="36">Going outside with an escort , raving with lips all afoam ;</l>
     <l n="37">Writing a cheque for a million , drivelling feebly of home ;</l>
     <l n="38">Lost like a louse in the burning ... or else in tented town</l>
     <l n="39">Seeking a drunkard 's solace , sinking and sinking down ;</l>
     <l n="40">Steeped in the slime at the bottom , dead to a decent world ,</l>
     <l n="41">Lost ‘ mid the human flotsam , far on the frontier hurled ;</l>
     <l n="42">In the camp at the bend of the river , with its dozen saloons aglare ,</l>
     <l n="43">Its gambling dens a-riot , its gramophones all a-blare ;</l>
     <l n="44">Crimped with the crimes of a city , sin-ridden and bridled with lies ,</l>
     <l n="45">In the hush of my mountained vastness , in the flush of my midnight</l>
     <l n="46">skies .</l>
     <l n="47">Plague-spots , yet tools of my purpose , so natheless I suffer them</l>
     <l n="48">thrive ,</l>
     <l n="49">Crushing my Weak in their clutches , that only my Strong may survive .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="50">“ But the others , the men of my mettle , the men who would ‘ stablish</l>
     <l n="51">my fame ,</l>
     <l n="52">Unto its ultimate issue , winning me honour , not shame ;</l>
     <l n="53">Searching my uttermost valleys , fighting each step as they go ,</l>
     <l n="54">Shooting the wrath of my rapids , scaling my ramparts of snow ;</l>
     <l n="55">Ripping the guts of my mountains , looting the beds of my creeks ,</l>
     <l n="56">Them will I take to my bosom , and speak as a mother speaks .</l>
     <l n="57">I am the land that listens , I am the land that broods ;</l>
     <l n="58">Steeped in eternal beauty , crystalline waters and woods .</l>
     <l n="59">Long have I waited lonely , shunned as a thing accurst ,</l>
     <l n="60">Monstrous , moody , pathetic , the last of the lands and the first ;</l>
     <l n="61">Visioning camp-fires at twilight , sad with a longing forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="62">Feeling my womb o'erhYpppHeNpregnant with the seed of cities unborn .</l>
     <l n="63">Wild and wide are my borders , stern as death is my sway ,</l>
     <l n="64">And I wait for the men who will win me — and I will not be won in a day ;</l>
     <l n="65">And I will not be won by weaklings , subtile , suave , and mild ,</l>
     <l n="66">But by men with the hearts of vikings , and the simple faith of a child ;</l>
     <l n="67">Desperate , strong , and resistless , unthrottled by fear or defeat ,</l>
     <l n="68">Them will I gild with my treasure , them will I glut with my meat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="69">“ Lofty I stand from each sister land , patient and wearily wise ,</l>
     <l n="70">With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet , passionless eyes ;</l>
     <l n="71">Dreaming alone of a people , dreaming alone of a day ,</l>
     <l n="72">When men shall not rape my riches , and curse me and go away ;</l>
     <l n="73">Making a bawd of my bounty , fouling the hand that gave —</l>
     <l n="74">Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path and I stamp them</l>
     <l n="75">into a grave .</l>
     <l n="76">Dreaming of men who will bless me , of women esteeming me good ,</l>
     <l n="77">Of children born in my borders , of radiant motherhood ;</l>
     <l n="78">Of cities leaping to stature , of fame like a flag unfurled ,</l>
     <l n="79">As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="80">This is the Law of the Yukon , that only the Strong shall thrive ;</l>
     <l n="81">That surely the Weak shall perish , and only the Fit survive .</l>
     <l n="82">Dissolute , damned , and despairful , crippled and palsied and slain ,</l>
     <l n="83">This is the Will of the Yukon ,— Lo ! how she makes it plain !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
  <p>THE PARSON 'S SON</p>
   <p>This is the song of the parson 's son , as he squats in his shack alone , On the wild , weird nights when the Northern Lights shoot up from the frozen zone , And it 's sixty below , and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I 'm one of the Arctic brotherhood , I 'm an old-time pioneer .</l>
     <l n="2">I came with the first — O God ! how I 've cursed this Yukon — but still</l>
     <l n="3">I 'm here .</l>
     <l n="4">I 've sweated athirst in its summer heat , I 've frozen and starved in</l>
     <l n="5">its cold ;</l>
     <l n="6">I 've followed my dreams by its thousand streams , I 've toiled and</l>
     <l n="7">moiled for its gold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">“ Look at my eyes — been snow-blind twice ; look where my foot 's half</l>
     <l n="9">gone ;</l>
     <l n="10">And that gruesome scar on my left cheek where the frost-fiend bit to</l>
     <l n="11">the bone .</l>
     <l n="12">Each one a brand of this devil 's land , where I 've played and I 've</l>
     <l n="13">lost the game ,</l>
     <l n="14">A broken wreck with a craze for ‘ hooch , ’ and never a cent to my name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">“ This mining is only a gamble , the worst is as good as the best ;</l>
     <l n="16">I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with</l>
     <l n="17">the rest ;</l>
     <l n="18">With Cormack , Ladue and Macdonald — O God ! but it 's hell to think</l>
     <l n="19">Of the thousands and thousands I 've squandered on cards and women</l>
     <l n="20">and drink .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">“ In the early days we were just a few , and we hunted and fished around ,</l>
     <l n="22">Nor dreamt by our lonely camp-fires of the wealth that lay under the</l>
     <l n="23">ground .</l>
     <l n="24">We traded in skins and whiskey , and I 've often slept under the shade</l>
     <l n="25">Of that lone birch-tree on Bonanza , where the first big find was made .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="26">“ We were just like a great big family , and every man had his squaw ,</l>
     <l n="27">And we lived such a wild , free , fearless life beyond the pale of the</l>
     <l n="28">law ;</l>
     <l n="29">Till sudden there came a whisper , and it maddened us every man ,</l>
     <l n="30">And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">“ Oh , those Dawson days , and the sin and the blaze , and the town all</l>
     <l n="32">open wide !</l>
     <l n="33">( If God made me in His likeness , sure He let the devil inside . )</l>
     <l n="34">But we all were mad , both the good and the bad , and as for the</l>
     <l n="35">women , well —</l>
     <l n="36">No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">“ Money was just like dirt there , easy to get and to spend .</l>
     <l n="38">I was all caked in on a dance-hall jade , but she shook me in the end .</l>
     <l n="39">It put me queer , and for near a year I never drew sober breath ,</l>
     <l n="40">Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on</l>
     <l n="41">death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="42">“ Twenty years in the Yukon , struggling along its creeks ;</l>
     <l n="43">Roaming its giant valleys , scaling its god-like peaks ;</l>
     <l n="44">Bathed in its fiery sunsets , fighting its fiendish cold ,</l>
     <l n="45">Twenty years in the Yukon ... twenty years — and I 'm old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="46">“ Old and weak , but no matter , there 's ‘ hooch ’ in the bottle still .</l>
     <l n="47">I 'll hitch up the dogs to-morrow , and mush down the trail to Bill .</l>
     <l n="48">It 's so long dark , and I 'm lonesome — I 'll just lay down on the bed ,</l>
     <l n="49">To-morrow I 'll go ... to-morrow ... I guess I 'll play on the red .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="50">“ ... Come , Kit , your pony is saddled . I 'm waiting , dear , in the</l>
     <l n="51">court ...</l>
     <l n="52">... Minnie , you devil , I 'll kill you if you skip with that flossy</l>
     <l n="53">sport ...</l>
     <l n="54">... How much does it go to the pan , Bill ?... play up , School , and</l>
     <l n="55">play the game ...</l>
     <l n="56">... Our Father , which art in heaven , hallowed be Thy name ... ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This was the song of the parson 's son , as he lay in his bunk alone , Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in , and his blue lips ceased to moan , And the hunger-maddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone .</p>
   <p>THE SPELL OF THE YUKON</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I wanted the gold , and I sought it ;</l>
     <l n="2">I scrabbled and mucked like a slave .</l>
     <l n="3">Was it famine or scurvy — I fought it ,</l>
     <l n="4">I hurled my youth into the grave .</l>
     <l n="5">I wanted the gold and I got it —</l>
     <l n="6">Came out with a fortune last fall ,—</l>
     <l n="7">Yet somehow life 's not what I thought it ,</l>
     <l n="8">And somehow the gold is n't all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">No ! There 's the land . ( Have you seen it ? )</l>
     <l n="10">It 's the cussedest land that I know ,</l>
     <l n="11">From the big , dizzy mountains that screen it ,</l>
     <l n="12">To the deep , deathlike valleys below .</l>
     <l n="13">Some say God was tired when He made it ;</l>
     <l n="14">Some say it 's a fine land to shun ;</l>
     <l n="15">Maybe : but there 's some as would trade it</l>
     <l n="16">For no land on earth — and I 'm one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">You come to get rich ( damned good reason ) ,</l>
     <l n="18">You feel like an exile at first ;</l>
     <l n="19">You hate it like hell for a season ,</l>
     <l n="20">And then you are worse than the worst .</l>
     <l n="21">It grips you like some kinds of sinning ;</l>
     <l n="22">It twists you from foe to a friend ;</l>
     <l n="23">It seems it 's been since the beginning ;</l>
     <l n="24">It seems it will be to the end .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">I 've stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow</l>
     <l n="26">That 's plumb-full of hush to the brim ;</l>
     <l n="27">I 've watched the big , husky sun wallow</l>
     <l n="28">In crimson and gold , and grow dim ,</l>
     <l n="29">Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the stars tumbled out , neck and crop ;</l>
     <l n="31">And I 've thought that I surely was dreaming ,</l>
     <l n="32">With the peace o ’ the world piled on top .</l>

   <p>THE LOW-DOWN WHITE</p>
   <p>This is the pay-day up at the mines , when the bearded brutes come down ; There 's money to burn in the streets to-night , so I 've sent my klooch to town , With a haggard face and a ribband of red entwined in her hair of brown .</p>
   <p>And I know at the dawn she 'll come reeling home with the bottles , one , two , three ; One for herself to drown her shame , and two big bottles for me , To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be .</p>
   <p>To make me forget the brand of the dog , as I crouch in this hideous place ; To make me forget once I kindled the light of love in a lady 's face , Where even the squalid Siwash now holds me a black disgrace .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Oh , I have guarded my secret well ! And who would dream as I speak</l>
     <l n="2">In a tribal tongue like a rogue unhung , ‘ mid the ranch-house filth</l>
     <l n="3">and reek ,</l>
     <l n="4">I could roll to bed with a Latin phrase , and rise with a verse of</l>
     <l n="5">Greek ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Yet I was a senior prizeman once , and the pride of a college eight ; Called to the bar — my friends were true ! but they could not keep me straight ; Then came the divorce , and I went abroad and “ died ” on the River Plate .</p>
   <p>But I 'm not dead yet ; though with half a lung there is n't time to spare , And I hope that the year will see me out , and , thank God , no one will care — Save maybe the little slim Siwash girl with the rose of shame in her hair .</p>
   <p>She will come with the dawn , and the dawn is near ; I can see its evil glow , Like a corpse-light seen through a frosty pane in a night of want and woe ; And yonder she comes , by the bleak bull-pines , swift staggering through the snow .</p>
