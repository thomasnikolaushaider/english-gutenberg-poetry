    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="1">“ Elias ” was begun in the spring of 1900 , and was first published in the autumn of 1904 , when an edition de luxe , limited to one hundred and fifty copies , and two less pretentious editions , were subscribed for by friends of the author . He was hardly a party to the project , the initial step being taken without his knowledge . Prior to that time he had read the poem to select gatherings in private homes and in two of the leading church schools , but had no thought of printing it so early , until solicited by a committee of prominent citizens to allow them to undertake , in his behalf , its publication .</p>
    <p n="2">That committee consisted of Governor Heber M. Wells , Senator George Sutherland , President Anthon H. Lund , Major Richard W. Young , and Mr. H. L. A. Culmer . These gentlemen , out of pure public spirit and a friendly feeling for the author , had associated themselves together for this purpose . Though aware of many defects in his work , and anxious to mend them before facing the public and the critics , he nevertheless accepted gratefully the very generous offer . All the members of the committee gave to the enterprise their hearty support , and two of them , Major Young and Mr. Culmer , conducted most of the business necessary to putting the book through the press .</p>
    <p n="3">Since the original issuance the author has endeavored to bring the work into a more finished state , and the results are now before the reader . The poem is in twelve parts — a prelude , ten cantos , and an epilogue . Following these are explanatory notes , for the benefit of students ; the introduction of the epic as a text book into the schools being one of the purposes for which it was written .</p>
    <p n="4">The character and scope of the work are partly indicated by the title , “ Elias — An Epic Of The Ages . ” It is an attempt to present , in verse form , historically , doctrinally , and prophetically , the vast theme comprehended in what the world terms “ Mormonism . ”</p>

    <p n="6">DEDICATION</p>
    <p n="7">( SEE NOTE . )</p>
    <p n="8">This song to thee , friend , chieftain , sixth to rise From him , the foremost of a seeric line , Mock of the worldly , marvel of the wise ,— His martyred brother 's son ! May light divine , Which ‘ lumined them , forever on thee shine , Flooding with splendors new thy lineal fame ; And ancient rays with modern beams combine To glorify a brow whose stalwart aim , To merit heaven 's high praise , nor fear a world 's false blame !</p>

    <epigraph>
     <p>“ And if you will receive it , this is Elias , which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and restore all things . ” ARGUMENT The aim of this poem is to point out those manifestations of the Divine Mind and those impulsions from human enterprise which have contributed in all ages to the progress of the race toward perfection . Thus it deals not only with man 's origin and destiny , with earth 's creation , redemption , and ultimate glorification , but with events and epochs leading up to and having those greater ends as their decreed consummation . The Christ theme , in its heavenly and earthly phases , is supplemented by the sacred and secular history of man upon both hemispheres . God 's direct dealings through prophets , apostles , and other inspired agents , and His indirect dealings through poets , painters , philosophers , inventors , discoverers , statesmen , kings , conquerors and the like , are indicated , and the experiences of the Church of Christ in various dispensations portrayed . The title “ Elias , ” signifying restoration and preparation ,— the lesser going before the greater with those objects in view ,— is used to denote and personify the Genius of Progress , whose beneficent workings , under the guidance of the Infinite Spirit , through the aeons and the ages , behind the scenes and upon the stage of human action , are the warp and woof of the entire poem . The medial point is the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times , the era of restitution , when the House of God is to be set in order , and all things in Christ are to be gathered into one .</p>

       <l n="2">Youth 's morn was breaking , when I dreamed a dream ,</l>
       <l n="3">Splendid as springtime 's weft of wonders rare ;</l>
       <l n="4">Idyllic vision , beauteous , bright romance ,</l>
       <l n="5">Glory of love and glamor of renown .</l>
       <l n="6">I dreamed that fame held all of happiness ,</l>
       <l n="7">Save the sweet charm that lurked in woman 's smile .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">Wealth wooed I not , nor power — to wear the sign</l>
       <l n="9">And wave the symbol of authority ;</l>
       <l n="10">To speak , and have hosts tremble ; or to frown ,</l>
       <l n="11">And find all pale and prostrate at my feet . 10</l>
       <l n="12">But oh ! to sway , like swinging forest boughs</l>
       <l n="13">In summer breeze , men 's yearning hearts and minds ,—</l>
       <l n="14">Sway them in duty 's name , in virtue 's cause ,</l>
       <l n="15">By tongue of thunder or by pen of flame ,</l>
       <l n="16">Leaving some wise , sublime , benefic deed ,</l>
       <l n="17">Some word or work of merit and of might ,</l>
       <l n="18">To fix the fleeting gaze of centuries !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">Glory and love — these were my guides divine ,</l>
       <l n="20">The planet passions of my destiny ,</l>
       <l n="21">The Baal and Astoreth<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>to whom I bowed , 20</l>
       <l n="22">At human shrines a worldly worshiper ,</l>
       <l n="23">Adoring beauteous dust , my fellow clay ,</l>
       <l n="24">And coveting an earthly immortality .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">And at the feet of these dear deities ,</l>
       <l n="26">Careless of great Jehovah 's smile or frown ,</l>
       <l n="27">In the fresh morning of my youth 's fair might ,</l>

       <l n="32">Tortured and torn with swift-flung darts of fire ;</l>
       <l n="33">Booming and crashing , bolt on bolt descends ;</l>

      <head>CANTO ONE</head>
       <l n="1">1 — Title : ** As From a Dream . ** The subject of this Canto is the</l>
       <l n="2">author 's spiritual awakening .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>2 — 20 . ** Baal and Astoreth ** ( also rendered Ashtoreth ) . Pagan deities , frequently mentioned in the Old Testament . They were worshiped by the idolatrous Israelites . The Prophet Elijah 's controversy with the priests of Baal is one of the most dramatic episodes in sacred history . ( I Kings 18 : 19-40 ) . Baal was the sun god , chief male divinity of the Phoenicians ; Ashtoreth , representing the moon , a goddess of the Philistines — the same as Astarte of the Zidonians . The corresponding deities among the Greeks and Romans were Zeus or Jupiter and Aphrodite or Venus .</p>
     <p>3 — 60 . ** Truth 's Triple Key . ** The Spirit of Truth , revealing past , present and future .</p>
     <p>4 — 86 . ** Ambrosial Gardens . ** The Gardens of the Gods — Heaven .</p>
     <p>5 — 92 . ** Paradise . ** The Spirit World , a place of rest for the righteous , awaiting resurrection and exaltation to glorious spheres beyond . ( Alma , 40 : 11-14 ; “ Joseph Smith 's Teachings , ” pp . 184 , 185 ; Key to Theology , 14 . )</p>
     <p>6 — 101 . ** Love 's Eyes . ** Love is usually represented as a blind boy , Cupid , shooting his arrows aimlessly . Love , when spiritually enlightened , is no longer blind , but has a definite purpose in view .</p>
     <p>7 — 111 . ** Lethean Ground . ** Lethe , in classic mythology , signifies oblivion . It was the name of a river in Hades , of which the dead drank and forgot all .</p>
     <p>8 — 117 . ** O Thou , Of Beauty ! ** The stanza beginning with these words is an apostrophe to Woman .</p>
     <p>9 — 130 . ** Apple of Ashes . ** On the shores of the Dead Sea there grows , it is said , a fruit resembling the apple , beautiful and inviting to the eye , but turning to ashes at the touch .</p>
     <p>10 — 167 . ** Equally May Win . ** The vanquished , as well as the victorious , may gain , through experience , development .</p>
     <p>11 — 174 . ** What Soul Can Grow ? ** Pride , greed , hate , and all other perverted passions , are as weeds and thorns in the garden of the heart . It is fair to presume that the Saviour , when he exhorted his disciples to forgive and love their enemies , had in view the welfare of the disciples themselves . It was more for their sake than for the sake of their enemies , that He gave the exhortation .</p>
     <p>12 — 185 . ** The Spirit of the Infinite . ** The Holy Spirit , assumed throughout the poem to be acting through “ Elias , ” the Genius of Progress , who also has his agents or instruments .</p>
     <p>13 — 219 . ** Time 's Hills and Vales . ** A metaphor suggested by the Book of Abraham ( 3 : 18 , 19 ) .</p>

     <head>CANTO THREE</head>
     <p>1 — Title : ** Elect of Elohim . ** Elohim , or Eloheim , the Hebrew plural for God . To the modern Jew it means the plural of majesty , not of number ; but to the Latter-day Saint it signifies both . As here used it stands for “ The Council of the Gods , ” or , as in Psalms 82 : 1 , “ The Congregation of the Mighty . ” In that council or congregation was elected , before Earth was formed , the Redeemer of the World . ( Pearl of Great Price — Moses 4 : 1-4 ; Abraham 3 : 22-28 ; Compendium p . 285 . ) This Canto glimpses the choosing of Messiah , the rebellion of Lucifer , the Saviour 's descent to Earth , his crucifixion and return to Glory . It is the beginning of the poem proper .</p>
     <p>2 — 450 . ** Olea 's Silver Beam . ** Olea , according to the Book of Abraham , is Moon ; Shinehah ( Shinea ) Sun ; and Kokaubeam , Stars . Kolob , according to the same authority , is a great governing planet “ nigh unto the throne of God . ” ( Abraham 3 ; D. and C. 76 : 25 , 28 . )</p>
     <p>3 — 504 . ** Mighty Michael . ** Michael the Archangel , leader of the hosts of Heaven against Lucifer and his rebellious legions , became Adam and fell from an immortal to a mortal state that he might become the progenitor of the human family .</p>
     <p>4 — 516 . ** Tried Souls . ** In “ Mormon ” theology “ soul ” means body and spirit combined , but in general literature , and especially poetry , “ soul ” and “ spirit ” are synonyms .</p>
     <p>5 — 522 . ** The Stepping-Stone . ** God 's children , such as kept the first or spirit estate , were given bodies upon this planet , thus becoming souls , capable of eternal increase and advancement . ( Abraham 3 : 26 . ) Two-thirds of the spirits then populating the Spirit World were found worthy of opportunities for experience and development in mortality , while one-third — those who rebelled — were denied that privilege . ( Compendium p . 288 . )</p>
     <p>6 — 528 . ** The Love That Hath Redeemed All Worlds . ** The Gospel of the Christ , the highest expression of God 's love for man , has saved many worlds , and is destined to save many more . ( Moses 1 : 33-39 . ) But the Gospel is more than a means of escape from impending ills ; it existed before man had need of salvation . A divine plan for human progress , embracing both the Fall and the Redemption , it was framed in the heavens before this earth was organized , and is a free gift from God to man . Man , however , to avail himself of its benefits , must yield obedience to its requirements . Redemption ( resurrection ) comes unconditionally , but salvation and exaltation depend upon human works as well as upon divine favor . A soul may be redeemed — raised from the dead — and yet condemned at the final judgment for evil deeds done in the body . Likewise may a soul be redeemed and saved , and yet come short of the glory that constitutes exaltation . To redeem , save and glorify is the threefold purpose of the Gospel of Christ . The English word “ Gospel ” comes from the Anglo-Saxon “ Godspell ” or God-Story — the story of God . In its fullest sense it signifies everything connected with the redemptive career of that Divine Being who gave His life that man might eternally live .</p>
     <p>7 — 548 . ** Exception Scorns . ** Lucifer , who fain would have been the Redeemer , proposed to save by coercive methods , involving the destruction of human agency , and demanded as his reward the honor that belongs to God . ( Moses 4 : 1-4 ; Abraham 3 : 22-28 )</p>
     <p>8 — 560 . ** My Messenger . ** It was Jehovah the God of Israel who became Jesus of Nazareth and died to redeem mankind ( D. and C. 110 : 1-4 ) . He is Son Ahman , concerning whom Orson Pratt , citing an unpublished revelation , says : “ What is the name of God in the pure language ? The answer says ‘ Ahman . ’ What is the name of the Son of God ? Answer , ‘ Son Ahman , the greatest of all the parts of God , excepting Ahman . ’ What is the name of men ? ‘ Son Ahman , ’ is the answer . ” ( Journal of Discourses , Vol . II , p . 342 . )</p>

       <l n="1">15 — 619 . ** Elias ? Yea and Nay . ** John the Baptist , forerunner of the</l>

       <l n="3">the Elias who is to restore all things . There are many Eliases ,</l>

      <head>CANTO FOUR</head>
      <head>1 — Title : ** Night and the Wilderness . ** This part of the poem is an allegory of the Christian or Meridian Dispensation , following the death of Jesus and his forerunner ; portraying the mission of the Comforter , and showing the departure from the primitive Faith , after the passing of the apostolic Twelve , one of whom — the Church having gone into the Wilderness — remains to testify of things to come . The “ Night ” is the spiritual night that followed the setting of the Sun of Righteousness — a night lit by Moon and Stars , with lesser lights twinkling through the Dark Ages and onward into modern times . The “ Wilderness ” is the world invisible . ( D. and C . 88 : 66 . )</head>
       <l n="1">2 — 688 . ** An Eagle 's Wings . ** The Roman Empire , emblemized by the</l>
       <l n="2">Eagle , dominated the then known world .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>3 — 696 . ** Peace to Flow . ** “ ( I ) The immense field covered by the conquests of Alexander gave to the civilized world a unity of language , without which it would have been , humanly speaking , impossible for the earliest preachers to have made known the good tidings in every land which they traversed . ( II ) The rise of the Roman Empire created a political unity which reflected in every direction the doctrines of the new faith . ( III ) The dispersion of the Jews prepared vast multitudes of Greeks and Romans for the unity of a pure morality and a monotheistic faith . The Gospel emanated from the capital of Judea ; it was preached in the tongue of Athens ; it was diffused through the empire of Rome ; the feet of its earliest missionaries traversed the solid structure of undeviating roads by which the Roman legionaries — ‘ those massive hammers of the whole earth ’ — had made straight in the desert a highway for our God . Semite and Aryan had been unconscious instruments in the hands of God for the spread of a religion which , in its first beginnings , both alike detested and despised . The letters of Hebrew and Greek and Latin inscribed above the cross were the prophetic and unconscious testimony of three of the world 's noblest languages to the undying claims of Him who suffered to obliterate the animosities of the nations which spoke them , and to unite them all together in the one great Family of God . ” — Dean Farrar , in “ The Life and Work of St. Paul , ” abridged edition , Book II , pp . 61 , 62 .</p>
     <p>4 — 706 . ** She-Wolf 's Might . ** The She-Wolf , traditionally the nurse of Romulus and Remus , who founded Rome , was also an emblem of that world-conquering power , which , though eventually it persecuted the Christians , at first protected them from their Jewish oppressors . Judah 's emblem was the Lion . As for the remaining figure in the allusion , it is written that the Saviour said to his disciples : “ I send you forth as lambs among wolves . ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">5 — 707 . ** Iron-Limbed . ** The phrases “ iron-limbed , ” “ brazen-loin , ”</l>
       <l n="2">“ silver-breasted , ” “ golden Babylon , ” characterize respectively the</l>
       <l n="3">Roman , Graeco-Macedonian , Medo-Persian , and Babylonian empires ,</l>
       <l n="4">which , in reverse order , ruled successively the ancient world .</l>
       <l n="5">Beginning with Babylon , the “ head of gold , ” these four universal</l>
       <l n="6">powers figure in the Prophet Daniel 's interpretation of</l>
       <l n="7">Nebuchadnezzar 's dream ( Daniel 2 ) .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>6 — 713 . ** Asian Kin . ** Alexander the Great extended his conquests as far eastward as India , whose native inhabitants claim kinship with European peoples through a common Aryan ancestry . If this claim be true , then the Hindoos , like the Europeans , are descended from Japheth , the eldest son of Noah , and consequently are “ Gentiles ” — a word springing from “ Gentilis , ” meaning “ of a nation , ” that is , a nation not of Israel .</p>
     <p>7 — 718 . ** Kurush . ** Cyrus , founder of the Medo-Persian empire .</p>

     <p>11 — 736 . ** Glory 's Symboling . ** Sun , moon and stars , symbolizing celestial , terrestrial , and telestial glories . ( D. and C . 76 : 96-98 . )</p>
     <p>12 — 742 . ** Vicegerent . ** The Comforter , concerning whom Jesus said , “ It is needful that I go , or He will not come unto you . ” In other words , the greater Light had to depart , before the lesser could shine in its fulness .</p>
     <p>13 — 743 . ** The Unembodied One . ** Says Joseph the Seer : “ The Father has a body of flesh and bones , as tangible as man 's ; the Son also ; but the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit . ” ( D. and C . 130 : 22 . )</p>
     <p>14 — 748 . ** After and Ere . ** God and Christ , the Father and the Son , by the power of the Holy Ghost created all things , and by that power will raise all from the dead .</p>
     <p>15 — 756 . ** Prophet Still Pleading . ** The Spirit of Prophecy , typified by John the Baptist , preaching in the wilderness .</p>
     <p>16 — 774 . ** Those Fluent Stars . ** The Twelve Apostles , oracles of God and crown of the Church of Christ . ( Rev . 12 : 1 . )</p>
     <p>17 — 781 . ** Save Haply One . ** John the Beloved . ( John 21 : 20-23 ; D. and C. 7 and 77 . )</p>
     <p>18 — 789 . ** Leading the Lost . ** It is believed that John the Revelator will lead the Lost Tribes from “ The Land of the North . ” ( D. and C. 77 : 14 ; Rev . 10 : 8-11 . )</p>
     <p>19 — 806 . ** The Man-Child . ** The Man-Child of the Apocalypse ( Rev . 12 : 5 ) represents the Priesthood — divine authority — which was taken from the Earth , with the fulness of the Gospel , after the passing of the Apostles .</p>
     <p>20 — 815 . ** Japheth Sways . ** Gentile domination over Israel , particularly in those nations where the Jews have been and are still oppressed .</p>
     <p>21 — 820 . ** Antaeus-Like . ** Antaeus was a fabled giant , vanquished by Hercules . Each time that Hercules threw him the giant gained fresh strength from coming in contact with the ground .</p>
     <p>22 — 822 . ** Conquering His Dust-Adoring Conqueror . ** The modern Jew is said to hold the purse-strings of the world .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">23 — 831 . ** That Gentile Hosts Might See . ** Saul of Tarsus , afterwards</l>
       <l n="2">Paul the Apostle , persecuted the Church of Christ before his</l>
       <l n="3">conversion ( Acts 9 : 1-19 ) . Thus was typified the spiritual blindness</l>
       <l n="4">of Israel , which caused the Gospel to be carried to the Gentiles .</l>
       <l n="5">Paul , the principal agent for their illumination , declares :</l>
       <l n="6">“ Blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the</l>
       <l n="7">Gentiles be come in . ” ( Rom . 11 : 25 . )</l>
     </lg>
     <p>24 — 832 . ** Martyred , Immolate . ** Israel 's dispersion , like Adam 's fall and Christ 's crucifixion , was part of a mighty plan for the promotion of the human race . Adam fell that mortal man might be . Christ died to burst the bands of death and make the fall effectual unto the higher ends ordained . The children of Israel were scattered over the world , in order that the Gospel might make its way more readily among all peoples . The history of Israel is the history of a martyred nation , suffering for the welfare of other nations , whatever may be said of the transgressions of the chosen people , which occasioned and justified the calamities that came upon them .</p>
     <p>25 — 841 . ** From ‘ Neath the Yoke . ** The future redemption of the Negro race .</p>
     <p>26 — 843 . ** See and Hear His Risen Lord . ** The House of Israel is privileged to receive the personal ministrations of the Saviour , while the Gentiles are ministered to by the Holy Ghost . ( III Nephi 15 : 23 . )</p>
     <p>27 — 847 . ** In the Mire . ** Beginning of the Christian departure from the true Faith .</p>
     <p>28 — 850 . ** The Heaven-Lit Torch . ** The Light of the Gospel , enjoyed by the primitive Christians , though compelled to hide from their Roman persecutors and worship God on mountain tops and in the catacombs .</p>
     <p>29 — 852 . ** Incense * * * Diana 's Shrine . ** Diana was a deity worshiped by the Romans . “ Incense ” — metaphorically the vain philosophies , traditions and customs , adopted by the false Church that came up in the place of the true Church and paganized itself in order to be popular with the world .</p>
     <p>30 — 855 . ** Shearing Compromise . ** The result , spiritually , of the enthronement of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire , A. D. 324 .</p>
     <p>31 — 861 . ** East from West . ** The pseudo Church , as well as the Empire of the Caesars , divided itself into East and West , with Constantinople and Rome as the capital cities .</p>
     <p>32 — 874 . ** She Was Wont . ** “ She ” stands for the true Church of Christ .</p>
     <p>33 — 880 . ** Crimson Courtesan . ** The Scarlet Woman described by John the Revelator ( Rev . 17 ) .</p>
     <p>34 — 900 . ** Till the Judgment Sits . ** A reference to Daniel 7 : 21-27 .</p>
     <p>35 — 902 . ** Glory Lift the Gloom . ** Messiah 's second coming .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">36 — 903 . ** The Moonlike One . ** The Holy Spirit , ruling the Night of</l>
       <l n="2">Ages , after the Light of the World has departed .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>37 — 908 . ** Impelling to All Action . ** The impelling power of the Spirit of God is interestingly set forth in I Nephi 13 : 10-19 . See also Lowell 's poems “ Columbus ” and “ A Glance Behind the Curtain . ”</p>
     <p>38 — 951 . ** Wayward Son of Deity . ** Napoleon and other conquerors type the class of characters here described .</p>
     <p>39 — 973 . ** Some Said Jeremias . ** When the Saviour inquired , “ Whom do men say that I am ? ” Peter answered “ Some say Thou art Elias , and some say Jeremias . ” Elias and Jeremias are Greek forms of the Hebrew names Elijah and Jeremiah . Joseph Smith , however , drew a distinction between the spirit of Elias and the spirit of Elijah . ( Compendium , pp . 281-283 . )</p>
     <p>40 — 983 . ** Mirror and Model of Humanity . ** “ God created man in his own image . ” ( Gen . 1 : 27 . )</p>
     <p>41 — 997 . ** Incomprehensible . ** So modern Christians contend respecting Deity . It is true only in part . God 's unrevealed infinite fulness is of course incomprehensible to the finite mind . But what He has revealed concerning Himself is not incomprehensible . Else why did He reveal it ?</p>
     <p>42 — 1008 . ** Each as a Star . ** The Jewish or Mosaic Dispensation shed light that prepared the world for a greater — the Christian Dispensation ; which , in its turn , made ready for one greater still — the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times . This is the significance of “ Elias . ” ( Compendium , p . 281 . )</p>
     <p>43 — 1020 . ** A Weapon for the Right . ** Such writers as Voltaire , Paine , and Ingersoll , subserve the cause of Christ by shattering false traditions , erroneously supposed by many to be true teachings of the Saviour and his Apostles .</p>

( Abraham 3 : 4 . ) 8 —<date>1085</date>. ** Hast Labored . ** The seven thousand years of Earth 's “ temporal existence ” correspond to the seven seals of the Apocalyptic Book ( Rev . 5 and 6 ) and are as seven great days , four of which had passed before Christ came , while nearly two have gone by since . According to this reckoning we are now in the Saturday evening of human history . The Millennium will be the seventh day — the World 's Sabbath .

D. 384 , by the Lamanites , a degenerate and savage faction of their own people , whose remnants were found by Columbus and named Indians . The golden plates containing the Nephite-Jaredite record were taken by Joseph Smith from the Jaredite hill Ramah , called by the Nephites , Cumorah .</p>

      <docTitle><titlePart>CANTO SIX 1 — Title : ** From Out The Dust . ** A paraphrase of Isaiah 29 : 4 . The prediction is held to have been fulfilled in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon . This entire Canto is based upon the general content of that volume . It embodies the prehistoric story of America , assumed to have been related by the angel custodian to the translator of the buried Book of Gold .</titlePart></docTitle>
      <docImprint>2 —<date>1415</date>. ** Must Righteous Be . ** See Ether 2 : 8-12 . 3 —<date>1434</date>. ** Former State . ** The Book of Mormon is the only adequate explanation of the origin of the American Indians . 4 —<date>1457</date>. ** Ancient Altar . ** Adam 's altar , in Adam-ondi-Ahman , otherwise Spring Hill , Daviess County , Missouri , ( D. and C. 116 ; History of the Church , Vol . 3 , p. 388 ) . 5 —<date>1461</date>. ** Dual Grave . ** Burial in earth and hell , or death temporal and spiritual . 6 —<date>1466</date>. ** Where Adam Dwelt . ** According to Joseph Smith , Jackson County , Missouri , is the ancient site of the Garden of Eden . Our First Parents , after their expulsion from Eden , dwelt in the Valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman . See Note 4 . 7 —<date>1468</date>. ** Still Chaste . ** The fall of Adam and Eve , while technically a sin because of a broken law , should be stressed as the means whereby God 's children obtained their bodies , rather than as an act of moral turpitude . There are two general classes of crimes — malum per se and malum prohibitum . Malum per se is a Latin phrase signifying “ an evil in itself , ” while malum prohibitum means “ that which is wrong because forbidden by law . ” The transgression of our First Parents was malum prohibitum , and the consequent descent from an immortal to a mortal condition was the Fall . 8 —<date>1470</date>. ** Love 's Work . ** Adam 's fall prepared the way for Christ 's redemptive mission . Had there been no fall , man would have remained a spirit , without a body , and consequently imperfect . Christ redeemed the soul — spirit and body — and put it in the way to perfection . 9 —<date>1471</date>. ** Zion of Primeval Days . ** The City of Enoch . ( Moses 7 : 18-64 ; History of the Church , Vol . 4 , pp . 209 , 210 ; D. and C . 84 : 99-102 . ) 10 —<date>1479</date>. ** Final Change . ** The change wrought upon the people of Enoch by translation not being equivalent to resurrection , they will have to undergo a further change , to prepare them for celestial glory . But they will not taste of death . A similar lot is that of John the Beloved ( John 21 : 20-23 ; D. and C. 7 ) ; also of the Three Nephites ( III Nephi 28 ) and of certain ones mentioned by Paul ( I Cor . 15 : 50-54 ) . 11 —<date>1480</date>. ** New Jerusalem . ** The divinely chosen site for the Holy City is Independence , Jackson County , Missouri . 12 —<date>1484</date>. ** Japheth * * * Shem . ** The reference is to Noah 's blessing upon Shem and Japheth ( Gen. 9 : 26-27 ) . From Shem came Abraham , the ancestor of the House of Israel ; and from Japheth the Gentiles , the founders of the most enlightened nations of modern times , including the<country>United States of America</country>. Ham , through Canaan , was the progenitor of the negro race , long held in slavery in this and other Gentile countries . The Ethiopian has also served the Semite , as Noah predicted . How Japheth has “ dwelt in the tents of Shem , ” is partly shown by the history of Palestine , long dominated by the Gentiles , particularly the Turks , who still possess it . Japheth 's remarkable blessing has also been realized in the history of our own country ,<country>America</country>, which the Gentiles now inhabit , and where , according to the Book of Mormon , they are to assist in gathering Israel and building the New Jerusalem , ( III Nephi 20 and 21 ) . It is their privilege to share , if they will , in all the blessings promised to the chosen people . ( Abraham 2 : 9-11 . ) “ The tents of Shem ” may be interpreted to mean the homes of the people of God , lineally descended from Shem , through Abraham . 13 —<date>1485</date>. ** An Ark of Peace . ** “ It shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another . ” ( D. and C. 45 : 69 ) . 14 —<date>1486</date>. ** The Ensign . ** The Church of Christ in Latter Days . 15 —<date>1487</date>. ** Joseph Signals Jacob . ** Joseph , in Ephraim , begins the work of Israel 's gathering . 16 —<date>1489</date>. ** Ancient of Days . ** Adam as the Ancient of Days will return to the place where he blessed his posterity . ( D. and C. 116 ; History of the Church , Vol . 3 , p. 388 ) .

     <p>20 — 1517 . ** Land of Joseph . ** America , as the Latter-day Saints have been taught to believe , was given to Joseph of old as an inheritance . ( Gen. 49 : 22 , 26 ; Deut . 33 : 13-17 ) .</p>
     <p>21 — 1519 . ** Gog and Magog . ** Gog is the name of a person ; Magog , of a country or people . According to Ezekiel ( 38 and 39 ) Gog , “ the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal , ” was to come with his people from the North to invade the land of Israel and there suffer defeat . Gog and Magog are generally understood as symbolical expressions for the heathen nations of Asia , more particularly the Scythians . In this poem the allusion is to those nations that war against Zion .</p>
     <p>22 — 1538 . ** Where , Joseph ? ** Joseph Smith is meant . To him , after a general introduction , Moroni relates the story of the Jaredites , as told in that part of the Book of Mormon entitled “ The Book of Ether . ”</p>
     <p>23 — 1540 . ** Wide Severing . ** In the days of Peleg the earth was “ divided ” ( Gen. 10 : 25 ) . Whether this means the dividing “ to the nations ” of “ their inheritance ” ( Deut . 32. 8 ) , or a tearing asunder of the land into continents and islands , is not stated . The latter view , the one here suggested , may help to explain why the site of the Garden of Eden is now in North America .</p>
     <p>24 — 1543 . ** Sons of Shinar . ** The Jaredites , who came from the Tower of Babel , the place of which was “ a plain in the Land of Shinar . ” ( Gen. 11 : 2 ) . Shinar was Chaldea .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>26 — 1554 . ** A Book Sublime . ** A book written by the Jaredite leader , and yet to come forth . That leader was Mahonri Moriancumr , though this name does not occur in the Book of Mormon . “ The Brother of Jared ” is the only appellation bestowed upon him there . Joseph Smith supplied the missing name .</p>
     <p>27 — 1557 . ** Baptismal Billows . ** The Jaredites , in barges , passed through the depths of the ocean , to reach their Land of Promise ( Ether 6 : 6 ) . Their voyage was therefore a baptism , more literal than the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea , and referred to by Paul as a baptism . ( 1 Cor . 10 : 2 . )</p>
     <p>28 — 1561 . ** Shelem 's Height . ** The Mount Shelem , so called “ because of its exceeding height . ” ( Ether 3 : 1 ) .</p>
     <p>29 — 1566 . ** Wing-Like Continents . ** North and South America .</p>
     <p>30 — 1573 . ** Mahonri 's Realm . ** North America , possessed by the Jaredites down to about 600 B. C ., when the nation was destroyed by internecine strife .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>34 — 1601 . **" Give Us a King . "** The Jaredites demanded a king — a demand reluctantly acceded to by their leaders , who foresaw , as did Samuel the Prophet , in a similar situation , the evils that would result . ( Ether 6 : 22-28 ; I Samuel 8 : 4-22 ) .</p>
     <p>35 — 1645 . ** Solitary Twain . ** The Prophet Ether and King Coriantumr , the last of the Jaredites .</p>
     <p>36 — 1653 . ** Another Nation . ** The Nephites .</p>
     <p>37 — 1657 . ** After Tale . ** These words — part of a brief comment by the author — introduce a summary of the Nephite narrative .</p>
     <p>38 — 1665 . ** A Leper . ** Jerusalem in her degenerate state .</p>
     <p>39 — 1666 . ** Prophet Pioneer . ** Lehi , a descendant of Joseph , through Manasseh , with a colony from Jerusalem , succeeds the all but extinct Jaredites upon the Land of Promise , where they extend the glory of their great ancestor .</p>
     <p>40 — 1669 . ** Joseph 's Bough . ** “ Joseph is a fruitful bough . ” ( Gen. 49 : 22 ) .</p>
     <p>41 — 1690 . ** Chosen Seer . ** Lehi predicts the coming of “ a choice seer ” who is to be a lineal descendant of Joseph . The name of that seer is also to be Joseph , and it is to be the name of his father — a prophecy fulfilled in Joseph Smith , Jr. ( II Nephi 3 . )</p>
     <p>42 — 1692 . ** Buried Lore . ** The Book of Mormon .</p>
     <p>43 — 1695 . ** Favored Son . ** Nephi , who succeeded his father Lehi , and against whom his brothers Laman and Lemuel rebelled , thus dividing the nation into Nephites and Lamanites .</p>

     <p>46 — 1731 . ** Prophet Prince Foresaw . ** Nephi 's vision of the future , in which he beheld events upon both hemispheres — Christ 's crucifixion and resurrection , and his subsequent appearings to the more righteous of the Nephites , preceded by awful judgments upon the wicked ( III Nephi 8-11 ) .</p>
     <p>47 — 1757 . ** Final Doom . ** The conflagrations that destroyed Nephite cities were prophetic of the end of the world , which is to be by fire .</p>
     <p>48 — 1771 . ** Infant Innocence . ** The children of the Nephites , blessed by the Saviour . ( III Nephi 17 : 11-24 ) .</p>
     <p>49 — 1785 . ** Other Sheep . ** Jesus said to his Jewish disciples , “ Other sheep I have , which are not of this fold . ” ( John 10 : 16 ) . They supposed that he meant the Gentiles , instead of which , as the Book of Mormon tells , he had reference to the Nephites and to other branches of the House of Israel .

      <head>CANTO SEVEN</head>
      <head>1 — Title : ** The Arcana of the Infinite . ** “ Arcana , ” the Latin plural of “ Arcanum , ” signifies hidden , secret . This title is intended to be an equivalent for “ The Mysteries of the Kingdom ” — the esoteric features or advanced principles of the Gospel . Herein are summarized those sublime doctrines that came directly to the modern Revelator during and subsequent to the translating of the ancient plates . A vision of the dispensations is involved — the reading of the Book of Time and the Volume of Eternity .</head>
       <l n="1">2 — 1986 . ** One Vast Mind . ** Joseph Smith , Prophet , Seer , and</l>
       <l n="2">Revelator .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>3 — 2009 . ** The Solemn Dispensations . ** In theology the term “ dispensation ” — from “ dispense , ” to deal out or distribute — signifies the method or scheme by which God has at different times developed his purposes and revealed himself to man . It also denotes a period marked by some particular development of the Lord 's work , such as the Mosaic Dispensation , lasting from Moses to Christ ; or the Meridian Dispensation , ending in the apostacy that made necessary another restoration of the Gospel and the Priesthood . While revelation is silent upon the subject , it is probable that there are seven Gospel dispensations — seven distinct periods during which the Plan of Progression , revealed from Heaven to Earth , has been among the children of men . The belief as to seven is partly based upon the scriptural or symbolical character of that number , and upon the Prophet Joseph 's teachings relative to the seven periods , each of a thousand years , answering to the seven seals of the mystical Book seen by John in his vision on Patmos ( Rev . 5 , 6 ; D. and C. 77 ) .</p>
     <p>4 — 2022 . ** The Trumpets Seven . ** The Angels of the Dispensations . ( D. and C. 88 : 92-116 ) .</p>

     <p>6 — 2057 . ** Ere Earth Knew Abraham . ** The pre-existence of the House of Israel is intimated by Moses ( Deut . 32 : 7 , 8 ) . The 144 , 000 mentioned by John ( Rev . 14 : 1 ) and by Joseph ( D. and C. 77 : 11 ) were “ of all the tribes of the children of Israel . ”</p>

     <p>12 — 2089 . ** The Ancient One . ** “ Daniel , in his seventh chapter , speaks of the Ancient of Days ; he means the oldest man , our father Adam , Michael ; he will call his children together and hold a council with them to prepare them for the coming of the Son of Man . ” — Joseph Smith ( History of the Church , Vol . 3 , p. 386 ; D. and C. 116 ) .</p>

     <p>15 — 2140 . ** Intelligence Eternal . ** “ Intelligence , or the light of truth , was not created or made , neither indeed can be ” ( D. and C. 93 : 29 , 36 ) . “ The first principles of man are self existent with God . ” ( “ Times and Seasons , ” August 15 , 1844 ) .</p>

     <p>9 — 2420 . ** The Captive Free . ** Christ , during the interval between his crucifixion and resurrection , visited and preached to “ the spirits in prison ” — spirits disobedient in the days of Noah , and swept away by the Deluge ( I Peter 3 : 19 , 20 ; and 4 : 61 ; Key to Theology 14 ) .</p>
     <p>10 — 2424 . ** Climbing Robber-like . ** According to the Bible , the people who built the Tower of Babel did so that its top might “ reach unto heaven ” ( Gen. 11 : 4 ) . Joseph Smith is said to have declared that the “ heaven ” they had in view was the City of Enoch , then suspended within sight of the earth . Endeavoring to get to Heaven by “ another way , ” the builders of Babel were comparable to “ thieves and robbers . ” Tradition asserts that the City of Enoch stood where the Gulf of Mexico now is .</p>

Moses led Israel out of temporal bondage , and Joseph began a work destined to deliver Israel from spiritual bondage . Thus Moses and Joseph were both typical of Him who redeemed the world from the bondage of sin and death .</p>
     <p>13 — 2467 . ** A Two-Fold Type . ** The social and spiritual condition of the Jewish saints and the Nephite disciples foretokened the Millennium .

     <p>4 — 2742 . ** Shinea 's Land . ** Kirtland , Ohio , and its environs , was “ The Land of Shinehah ” ( D. and C. 82 : 12 and 104 : 40-48 ) . From that part , in 1837-38 , the Church moved its headquarters to Far West , Caldwell County , Missouri .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>6 — 2759 . ** Laman 's Bands . ** The first mission to the Lamanites ( Indians ) was undertaken in the autumn of 1830 . The missionaries labored also among the white people of Ohio and Missouri . At Independence , which was then on the frontier of the United States , they crossed the line into Indian Territory , now the State of Kansas .</p>
     <p>7 — 2767 . ** Lands the Rarest . ** The region drained by the Mississippi and Missouri rivers .</p>
     <p>8 — 2779 . ** Japheth 's Wrath . ** The Gentiles in Western Missouri , misapprehending the motives of the “ Mormons ” in gathering to that part , and incited by evil-minded agitators , rose against the newcomers , and drove them first from Jackson County , and eventually from the State .</p>
     <p>9 — 2788 . ** The Shoulders . ** Civilization , with its steamships , railroads , and other utilities , and persecution , with faggot and sword , have helped God 's people to accomplish their destiny . “ The blood of the martyrs ” has been “ the seed of the Church , ” whose every movement , voluntary or compulsory , has been toward the goal of its ultimate triumph .</p>
     <p>10 — 2791 . ** Calm Caesar . ** Julius Caesar , while crossing a stormswept water , quieted the apprehensions of his boatman by remarking , “ Fear not , you carry Caesar and his fortunes . ”</p>

       <l n="2">“ Mormonism . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>12 — 2800 . ** Sees Menace . ** Having come mostly from the North and the East , the “ Mormons ” were suspected by the slave-holding Missourians of being abolitionists . This false charge , with others equally groundless , caused the persecution that followed .</p>
     <p>13 — 2813 . ** A Second Pharaoh * * * A Herod . ** These epithets fitly characterize the Governor of Missouri , Lilburn W. Boggs , who issued the edict under which the persecuted people were expelled . Said he , to the mob-militia who drove them from their homes : “ The Mormons must be exterminated or driven from the State . ”</p>
     <p>14 — 2815 . ** Gathering the Whirlwind . ** Missouri paid her debt to justice during the Civil War , when her Western borders , where mob violence had assailed her “ Mormon ” citizens , were ravaged again and again by the fierce guerilla warfare that spent its fury in that unhappy region .</p>
     <p>15 — 2829 . ** Shakes the Dungeon . ** Joseph Smith and others were imprisoned in Richmond Jail , where they were taunted by their guards , who boasted of murders and outrages committed upon the defenseless people after the surrender of Far West . The lion-hearted leader endured it till he could endure no more . Springing to his feet , he rebuked the ribald wretches , commanding them in the name of Jesus Christ to be still . They obeyed , cowering before him and begging his pardon . Parley P. Pratt , a fellow prisoner with the Prophet , says of this remarkable incident : “ He ceased to speak . He stood erect in terrible majesty , chained and without a weapon . * * * I have seen the ministers of justice , clothed in magisterial robes , and criminals arraigned before them , while life was suspended on a breath in the courts of England ; I have witnessed a Congress in solemn session to give laws to nations * * * but dignity and majesty have I seen but once , as it stood in chains at midnight in a dungeon , in an obscure village of Missouri . ” ( Autobiography , pp . 229 , 230 . )</p>
     <p>16 — 2835 . ** Disease and Death Subdued . ** After the Prophet had regained his freedom , and while his followers were settling at Commerce ( afterwards Nauvoo ) , an epidemic of fever and ague swept over that region . Many , prostrated by the malady , were miraculously healed under his administrations .</p>

     <p>18 — 2839 . ** City , Mother of Many . ** Nauvoo the Beautiful , built upon the site of Commerce , in Hancock County , Illinois , was the parent and model of many other cities subsequently founded by the Latter-day Saints , mostly in the region of the Rocky Mountains .</p>

     <p>21 — 2860 . ** Crisis Past . ** Early in 1837 , during a period of apostacy at Kirtland , the Prophet said : “ Something new must be done to save the Church . ” Thereupon he appointed Heber C. Kimball , of the Council of the Twelve , to head a mission to Europe . Part of the opposition encountered by Elder Kimball and his associates was a fierce onslaught by evil spirits , at Preston , England , where they began their labors . ( Life of Heber C. Kimball , pp . 138-146 . ) The first company of emigrating Saints from abroad sailed from Liverpool for Nauvoo , in 1840 . By that time another apostolic mission , headed by Brigham Young , President of the Twelve , had been sent to the British Isles .</p>
     <p>22 — 2863 . ** Befriended by the Just . ** Many of the people of Illinois extended a hospitable welcome to the plundered and homeless “ Mormons , ” fleeing out of Missouri .</p>
     <p>23 — 2866 . ** Earliest Offering . ** Ephraim is the first branch of the Israelitish tree to bear the fruits of faith in and obedience to the Gospel in latter days . “ Ephraim is my first-born , ” the Lord says through Jeremiah ( 31 : 9 ) . That is , Ephraim , who “ mixed himself among the people ” ( Hosea 7 : 8 ) , is the first to be “ born of God ” — baptized and gathered out from the nations .</p>
     <p>24 — 2877 . ** Egypt of the West . ** America , where the gathered descendants of Joseph are to re-enact upon a larger scale the part played by their great ancestor in the famine-stricken nation on the Nile .</p>
     <p>25 — 2882 . ** Long Lost Captives . ** The Ten Tribes , carried away by the Assyrians , B. C. 721 , and who are to return from “ the north countries ” ( D. and C. 133 : 26-35 ) .</p>
     <p>26 — 2891 . ** Rallying the Loyal . ** The Latter-day Saints have been taught to look forward to a time when they , lifting up an ensign to lovers of law , order , and liberty , and reinforced by them , will save this Nation , while anarchy is aiming at its life .</p>
     <p>27 — 2903 . ** Inglorious Battleground . ** The field of Cumorah .</p>
     <p>28 — 2905 . ** Where Erst He Fled . ** The House of Joseph , in modern times , begins its march of destiny at the Hill Cumorah , where the Nephites ( also of Joseph ) met their tragic fate . There is a tradition to the effect that every Temple reared by the Latter-day Saints marks a stage in the flight of the doomed Nephites , pursued by the victorious Lamanites , to the final slaughter at that historic hill .</p>
     <p>29 — 2919 . ** Ruined Lie . ** The allusion is to cities and temples built and abandoned by the Saints in Ohio , Missouri , and Illinois . ( D. and C. 101 , 103 , and 105 . )</p>

     <p>2 — 2994 . ** Honor of a State . ** Joseph the Prophet and Hyrum the Patriarch were murdered while under the pledged protection of the Governor of Illinois .
