    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">In the pages that follow , I make no attempt to supply a consecutive and comprehensive history of English stage travestie . This would have been impossible within the limits assigned to me . My object has been simply to furnish an introduction to such a history , supplemented by sketches of the various groups into which English stage burlesques naturally fall , with such extracts as might serve to exhibit the respective methods of individual travestie-writers . My business has been with the literary rather than the histrionic side of burlesque — with the witty and humorous , rather than the purely theatrical , features of the subject with which I had to deal . At the same time , I hope that the details I have been able to give concerning dates , and “ casts , ” and so on , may be useful to at least a large section of my readers .</p>
    <p n="2">I ought to say that , while I have endeavoured to mention all the most representative burlesques of which our stage history keeps record , I have intentionally left outside of my scheme all “ extravaganzas , ” “ bouffoneries musicales , ” and other such miscellaneous varieties of comic literature ,— confining myself to definite and deliberate travesties of subjects previously existent .</p>
    <p n="3">I have to thank more than one kind friend for information and material supplied , and more than one living writer of burlesque for the opportunity of consulting his “ prompt books ” and thus quoting from unpublished work .</p>

    <docImprint>NOTE .— Those who desire to extend their acquaintance with the literature of English stage burlesque may be recommended to turn first to the travesties published by Mr. French , which include those by Planche , and many by the Broughs , H. J. Byron , Talfourd , F. C. Burnand , etc . Mr. Gilbert 's “ Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ” is to be found in his volume entitled “ Foggerty 's Fairy , and Other Stories . ” A large proportion of the burlesques discussed , quoted , or mentioned in the following chapters are out of print , and to be seen only at the British Museum , on the second-hand bookstalls , or on the shelves of private collectors . [ We beg to acknowledge the courtesy of MM . Walery , Limited , in permitting us to avail ourselves of their photographs of Messrs. Burnand and Gilbert ; and of Mr. Bassano for the same permission in regard to that of Mr. G. R . Sims .— ED . W. L .]</docImprint>

    <docTitle><titlePart>A BOOK OF BURLESQUE . I . THE BEGINNINGS OF BURLESQUE . Who shall say when the spirit of burlesque first made its appearance on our stage ? There were traces of it , we may be sure , in the Mysteries and Moralities of pre-Elizabethan days ; the monkish dramatists were not devoid of humour , and the first lay playwrights had a rough sense of ridicule . The “ Vice ” which figured in so many of our rude old dramas had in him an element of satire , and the pictures drawn of his Satanic Majesty were conscious or unconscious caricatures of the popular conception of the Evil One . In all these cases , however , the burlesque was general . It was of the nature of travestie , and of the vaguest sort . Of particular parody one finds but few signs in the Elizabethan drama . There is a little of it in Shakespeare , where he pokes fun at the turgidity of contemporary tragedy or at the obscurity of contemporary Euphuism . The Pyramus and Thisbe episode is less burlesque than satire . It is an expose of the absurdities of the amateur performer , for whom Shakespeare , as a professional actor , could have only an amused contempt .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>“ The Bard ” parodied , but he did not burlesque . That was left to the initiative of the gifted literary Dioscuri , Beaumont and Fletcher . “ The Knight of the Burning Pestle , ” which saw the light in<date>1611</date>, is not wholly a travestie , but it contains a travestie within itself . In the main it is a dramatic exposition of a love story , the scene of which is laid in the middle-class life of the time . Ralph , the Knight of the Burning Pestle , is by no means the hero of the tale ; rather is he an excrescence upon it . A grocer and his wife sit on the stage , and suggest to the actors that Ralph , their apprentice , shall take part in the performance . They want a play in which a grocer shall do “ admirable things , ” and Ralph is bound to do them . The apprentice , it would seem , is an amateur actor — he “ hath played before , ” and so finds no difficulty in adapting himself to the situation . When he enters , it is “ like a grocer in his shop , with two prentices , reading ‘ Palmerin of<country>England</country>. ’ ” This gives us the key to the satire . Ralph is to burlesque the romances of chivalry , which were then so common in<country>England</country>, as elsewhere . “ Palmerin of<country>England</country>” had been “ translated out of French ” by Anthony Munday and assistants , and published between<date>1580</date>and<date>1602</date>. Ralph starts with a quotation from it , and then goes on to say :— Certainly those knights are much to be commended who , neglecting their possessions , wander with a squire and a dwarf through the deserts to relieve poor ladies .... There are no such courteous and fair well-spoken knights in this age . He whom Palmerin would have called “ Fair Sir , ” and she whom Rosiclear would have called “ Right beauteous Damsel , ” are now spoken of opprobriously . But why should not Ralph be the means of wiping out this reproach ?— Why should I not pursue this course , both for the credit of myself and our company ? For amongst all the worthy books of achievements , I do not call to mind that I yet read of a grocer-errant : I will be the said knight . Have you heard of any that hath wandered unfurnished of his squire and dwarf ? Thy elder prentice Tim shall be my trusty squire , and little George my dwarf . Hence , my blue apron ! Yet , in remembrance of my former trade , upon my shield shall be portrayed a burning pestle , and I will be called the Knight of the Burning Pestle . My beloved squire , and George my dwarf , I charge you that henceforth you never call me by any other name but “ the right courteous and valiant Knight of the Burning Pestle ” ; and that you never call any female by the name of a woman or wench , but “ fair lady , ” if she have her desires ; if not , “ distressed damsel ” ; that you call all forests and heaths “ deserts , ” and all horses “ palfreys . ” After this , Ralph reappears at various points in the action . He interposes , Quixote-like , in the aforesaid love-affair , and gets belaboured by the favoured lover for his pains . Later , he puts up at an inn , and , about to leave , is surprised when the tapster draws his attention to the fact that the reckoning is not paid :— Ralph . Right courteous Knight , who for the order 's sake Which thou hast ta'en , hang'st out the holy Bell , As I this flaming pestle bear about , We render thanks to your puissant self , Your beauteous lady , and your gentle squires , For thus refreshing of our wearied limbs , Stiffen 'd with hard achievements in wild desert . Tapster . Sir , there is twelve shillings to pay . Ralph . Thou merry squire Tapstero , thanks to thee For comforting our souls with double jug : And if adventurous fortune prick thee forth , Thou jovial squire , to follow feats of arms , Take heed thou tender ev'ry lady 's cause , Ev'ry true knight , and ev'ry damsel fair , But spill the blood of treacherous Saracens , And false enchanters that with magic spells Have done to death full many a noble knight . Host . Thou valiant Knight of the Burning Pestle , give ear to me : there is twelve shillings to pay , and as I am a true knight , I will not bate a penny .... Ralph . Sir knight , this mirth of yours becomes you well ; But , to requite this liberal courtesy , If any of your squires will follow arms , He shall receive from my heroic hand A knighthood , by the virtue of this pestle . The host , however , insists upon receiving his twelve shillings , and the grocer 's wife , in great fear lest harm shall befall her Ralph , requests her husband to pay the money . In a subsequent scene , Ralph conquers the giant Barbaroso , and releases his captives . By-and-by he goes into Moldavia , where he touches the heart of the king 's daughter , but tells her that he has already pledged his troth to Susan , “ a cobbler 's maid in Malte Street , ” whom he vowed never to forsake . At the end of the play he comes on to explain , at length , that he is dead , taking the opportunity to recount his various performances . The fun is never very brilliant ; and the “ Knight of the Pestle , ” albeit by writers so distinguished , is not , for the present-day Englishman , particularly exhilarating reading . One can imagine , however , how droll it seemed to our ancestors , with whom it remained popular for over half a century , surviving till the time of Mistress Eleanor Gwynne , who once spoke the prologue to it . Our first burlesque , then , was a satire upon exaggerated fiction . Our second was a satire upon extravagant plays . It is possible that “ The Rehearsal ” was represented before “ The Knight of the Burning Pestle ” left the boards . Begun in<date>1663</date>, and ready for production before<date>1665</date>, it was first performed in<date>1671</date>. It is ascribed to George Villiers , Duke of Buckingham ; but probably there were several hands engaged in it . It was the outcome of the boredom and the laughter caused by the wildness and bombast of the Restoration plays . There were some things in the stage of that day which the wits could not abide :— Here brisk insipid rogues , for wit , let fall Sometimes dull sense ; but oft'ner none at all . There , strutting heroes , with a grim-fac 'd train , Shall brave the gods , in King Cambyses ’ vein . For ( changing rules , of late , as if man writ In spite of reason , nature , art , and wit ) Our poets make us laugh at tragedy , And with their comedies they make us cry . So runs the prologue to “ The Rehearsal , ” which was destined to strike the first blow at the mechanical dramas that had succeeded the masterpieces of the Shakespearian period . Bayes , the playwright whose tragedy is supposed to be “ rehearsed , ” is usually accepted as a skit upon Dryden , whose dress , speech , and manner were openly mimicked by Lacy , the interpreter of the part . But there is reason to believe that Davenant first sat for the portrait , and in the end Bayes became a sort of incarnated parody of all the Restoration playwrights . This preposterous play travesties a whole school of dramatic writing . Dramas by Dryden , Davenant , James and Henry Howard , Mrs. Behn , and Sir William Killigrew and others , are directly satirised in certain passages ; but in the main the satire is general . For instance , in one place fun is made of the prevalence of similes in the dramas aimed at . Prince Prettyman , in the rehearsed play , falls asleep , and Chloris , coming in , finds him in that situation :— Bayes . Now , here she must make a simile . Smith ( one of the spectators ) . Where 's the necessity of that , Mr. Bayes ? Bayes . Because she 's surpris 'd . That 's a general rule : you must ever make a simile when you are surpris 'd ; ‘ tis the new way of writing . Elsewhere it is confusion of metaphor , very common among the second-rate “ tragedians , ” that is derided . Says the physician in the play :— All these threat'ning storms , which , like impregnant clouds , do hover o'er our heads ( when once they are grasped but by the eye of reason ) , melt into fruitful showers of blessings on the people . Bayes . Pray mark that allegory . Is not that good ? Johnson ( another spectator ) . Yes , that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable . In one place , Smith , the aforesaid onlooker , complains that , amid all the talk , the plot stands still ; to which Bayes replies , “ Why , what the devil is the plot good for but to bring in fine things ? ” At another juncture we have the first hint of a bit of persiflage which Sheridan afterwards imitated in “ The Critic . ” It has reference to the portentous reticence of some of the dialogue in Restoration plays . An usher and a physician are on the stage :— Phys . If Lorenzo should prove false ( which none but the great gods can tell ) you then perhaps would find that —— ( whispers ) . Usher . Alone , do you say ? Phys . No , attended with the noble —— ( whispers ) . Usher . Who , he in grey ? Phys . Yes , and at the head of —— ( whispers ) . Usher . Then , sir , most certain ‘ twill in time appear , These are the reasons that have induc 'd ‘ em to't ; First , he —— ( whispers ) . Secondly , they —— ( whispers ) . Thirdly , and lastly , both he and they —— ( whispers ) . [ Exeunt whispering .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Well , sir , ” says Smith to Bayes , “ but pray , why all this whispering ? ” “ Why , sir , ” replies the dramatist , “ because they are supposed to be politicians , and matters of state ought not to be divulg 'd . ” In its direct travestie “ The Rehearsal ” is often very happy . Dryden had claimed for his tragedies that they were written by “ th ’ exactest rules ” ; so Bayes exhibits to his friends Smith and Johnson what he calls his “ Book of Drama Commonplaces , the mother of many plays , ” containing “ certain helps that we men of art have found it convenient to make use of . ” “ I do here aver , ” he says , “ that no man yet the sun e'er shone upon has parts sufficient to furnish out a stage , except it were by the help of these my rules . ” Davenant , in his “ Love and Honour , ” had portrayed a mental and spiritual struggle between those potent forces . Bayes , accordingly , is made to introduce a scene in which Prince Volscius , sitting down to pull on his boots , wonders whether he ought or ought not to perform that operation :— My legs , the emblem of my various thought , Show to what sad distraction I am brought . Sometimes , with stubborn Honour , like this boot , My mind is guarded , and resolv 'd to do't : Sometimes , again , that very mind , by Love Disarmed , like this other leg does prove . Shall I to Honour or to Love give way ? Go on , cries Honour ; tender Love says , Nay ; Honour aloud commands , Pluck both boots on ; But softer Love does whisper , Put on none . In the end , he “ goes out hopping , with one boot on , and t'other off . ” Again , there was a passage in the drama called “ The Villain , ” in which the host supplied his guests with a collation out of his clothes — a capon from his helmet , cream out of his scabbard , and so on . In like manner , Pallas , in Mr. Bayes 's tragedy , furnishes forth the two usurping kings :— Lo , from this conquering lance Does flow the purest wine of France : And to appease your hunger , I Have in my helmet brought a pie ; Lastly , to bear a part with these , Behold a buckler made of cheese . Of the direct parody in the burlesque a few instances will suffice . Almanzor , in “ The Conquest of Granada , ” becomes the Drawcansir of Mr. Bayes 's work ; and while the former ejaculates — He who dares love , and for that love must die , And , knowing this , dares yet love on , am I ,— the latter caps it with — He that dares drink , and for that drink dares die , And knowing this , dares yet drink on , am I . Again , while Almanzor says to his rival in love — Thou dar'st not marry her , while I 'm in sight ; With a bent brow , thy priest and thee I 'll fright ,— Drawcansir , snatching the bowls of wine from the usurpers , cries — Whoe'er to gulp one drop of this dare think , I 'll stare away his very power to drink . The simile of the boar and the sow has often been quoted ; it seems to have been always a favourite with our playgoing ancestors . In “ The Conquest of Granada ” we read :— So two kind turtles , when a storm is nigh , Look up , and see it gathering in the sky .... Perch 'd on some dropping branch , they sit alone , And coo and hearken to each other 's moan . Mr. Bayes imitated this in what he called “ one of the most delicate , dainty similes in the world , egad ":— So boar and sow , when any storm is nigh , Snuff up , and smell it gath'ring in the sky .... Pensive in mud they wallow all alone , And snort and gruntle to each other 's moan .</p>

    <docImprint>The example set by Buckingham in “ The Rehearsal ” was followed , more than half a century later , by Henry Fielding , in “ The Tragedy of Tragedies , or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great . ” This was brought out in<date>1730</date>, in two acts , and was so immediately and largely successful that the author was induced to expand its two acts into three . It was afterwards published , with elaborate notes , setting forth a number of “ parallel passages ” from Dryden downwards , and with a preface , in which the supposed editor , H. Scriblerus Secundus , gravely assigned the origin of the “ tragedy ” to the age of Elizabeth . Apropos of parallel passages , the editor says :— Whether this sameness of thought and expression [ on the part of the authors quoted ] ... proceeded from an agreement in their way of thinking , or whether they have borrowed from our author , I leave the reader to determine . I shall adventure to affirm this of the Sentiments of our author , that they are generally the most familiar which I have ever met with , and at the same time delivered with the highest dignity of phrase ; which brings me to speak of his diction . Here I shall only beg one postulatum — viz ., that the greatest perfection of the language of a tragedy is , that it is not to be understood ; which granted ( as I think it must be ) , it will necessarily follow that the only ways to avoid this is by being too high or too low for the understanding , which will comprehend everything within its reach . The editor goes on to say that “ our author excelleth ” in both these styles . “ He is very rarely within sight through the whole play , either rising higher than the eye of your understanding can soar , or sinking lower than it careth to stoop . ” Fielding does not adopt in “ Tom Thumb ” the machinery of “ The Rehearsal . ” “ Tom Thumb ” is a burlesque tragedy , standing by itself , and intended for representation in the serious spirit which should animate all true burlesque . Tom Thumb is “ a little hero , with a great soul , ” who , as a reward for his victories over the race of giants , demands in marriage the hand of Huncamunca , the daughter of King Arthur . As he observes :— I ask not kingdoms , I can conquer those ; I ask not money , money I 've enough ; For what I 've done , and what I mean to do , For giants slain , and giants yet unborn Which I will slay — if this be call 'd a debt , Take my receipt in full : I ask but this — To sun myself in Huncamunca 's eyes . “ Prodigious bold request , ” remarks the King ; but he decides , nevertheless , to give Huncamunca to Tom Thumb . Unhappily , Lord Grizzle is enamoured of the princess , and , in revenge , leads an insurrection against the Court . He is , however , conquered by the little hero , who is about to be wedded to his charmer , when , alas ! as he is marching in triumph through the streets , he is swallowed by “ a cow , of larger than the usual size . ” Queen Dollallolla , who is in love with Tom , slays with her own hand the messenger who brought the news . Thereupon , Cleora , who is in love with the messenger , kills the Queen . Huncamunca , by way of reprisal , kills Cleora . A certain Doodle kills Huncamunca ; one Mustacha kills Doodle ; the King kills Mustacha , and then kills himself , exclaiming — So when the child , whom nurse from danger guards , Sends Jack for mustard with a pack of cards , Kings , queens and knaves throw one another down , Till the whole pack lies scatter 'd and o'erthrown ; So all our pack upon the floor is cast , And all I boast is — that I fall the last . We have here a happy satire upon the sanguinary conclusions given to the tragedies of the seventeenth century . Great pains , too , are taken , throughout the “ tragedy , ” to travestie that bete noire of the humourists , the dragged-in simile , to which not even “ The Rehearsal ” had given the coup de grace . The ghost of Tom Thumb 's father is made to say — So have I seen the bees in clusters swarm , So have I seen the stars in frosty nights , So have I seen the sand in windy days , So have I seen the ghost on Pluto 's shore , So have I seen the flowers in spring arise , So have I seen the leaves in autumn fall , So have I seen the fruits in summer smile , So have I seen the snow in winter frown . Whereupon the king says , “ D — n all thou hast seen ! ” Grizzle , when on the point of expiring , cries — Some kinder sprite knocks softly at my soul , And gently whispers it to haste away . I come , I come , most willingly I come . So , when some city wife , for country air , To Hampstead or to Highgate does repair , Her to make haste her husband does implore , And cries , “ My dear , the coach is at the door ": With equal wish , desirous to be gone , She gets into the coach , and then she cries , “ Drive on ! ” Some of the mock similes in “ Tom Thumb ” are among the most familiar things in literature . We all remember the lines — So , when two dogs are fighting in the streets , When a third dog one of the two dogs meets , With angry teeth he bites him to the bone , And this dog smarts for what that dog has done . And these — So , when the Cheshire cheese a maggot breeds , Another and another still succeeds ; By thousands and ten thousands they increase , Till one continued maggot fills the rotten cheese . The burlesque contained within the pages of “ Tom Thumb ” covers a considerable field . Dryden is once more very freely satirised , some nine or ten of his plays being held up to ridicule . But much attention is at the same time paid to dramas which saw the light after the production of “ The Rehearsal . ” Thus , there are allusions to the “ Mithridates , ” “ Nero , ” and “ Brutus ” of Nathaniel Lee , which belong to<date>1674-1679</date>; to the “ Marius ” of Otway (<date>1680</date>) ; to the “ Anna Bullen , ” “ Earl of Essex , ” “ Mary Queen of Scots , ” and “ Cyrus the Great ” of Banks (<date>1680-1696</date>) ; to the “ Persian Princess ” of Theobald (<date>1711</date>) , to Addison 's “ Cato ” (<date>1713</date>) , to Young 's “ Busiris ” and “ The Revenge , ” and even to Thomson 's “ Sophonisba , ” which had come out only in the year preceding that in which “ Tom Thumb ” was performed . “ O Sophonisba , Sophonisba O ” ( which had already been parodied in the form of “ O Jemmy Thomson , Jemmy Thomson O ” ) is here laughed at in “ O Huncamunca , Huncamunca O ! ” In “ Cyrus the Great ” the virtuous Panthea remarks to one lover — For two I must confess are gods to me , Which is my Abradatus first , and thee . And , in a like spirit , Huncamunca , after wedding Tom Thumb , is quite willing to wed Grizzle :— My ample heart for more than one has room : A maid like me Heaven form 'd at least for two . I married him , and now I 'll marry you ,— thereby reminding us of the obliging defendant in Mr. Gilbert 's “ Trial by Jury , ” who is ready to “ marry this lady to-day , and marry the other to-morrow . ” In the third act of “ Cato ” is a simile which Fielding parodies thus — putting it into the mouth of Grizzle :— So have I seen , in some dark winter 's day , A sudden storm rush down the sky 's highway , Sweep through the streets with terrible ding-dong , Gush thro ’ the spouts , and wash whole crowds along , The crowded shops the thronging vermin screen , Together cram the dirty and the clean , And not one shoe-boy in the street is seen . Finally , we have this equally well-known passage , suggested by the remark of Lee 's Mithridates that he “ would be drunk with death ":— Doodle . My liege , I a petition have here got . King . Petition me no petitions , sir , to-day ; Let other hours be set apart for business . To-day it is our pleasure to be drunk , And this our queen shall be as drunk as we . It was the fate of “ Tom Thumb ” to be transformed — so far as it was possible to transform it — into a burlesque of Italian opera as well as of conventional drama . “ Set to music after the Italian manner , ” it was brought out in<date>1733</date>as “ The Opera of Operas , ” and had considerable vogue in the new guise thus given to it . It had been preceded in<date>1727</date>by Gay 's “ Beggar 's Opera ” ; but that famous work was a social and political satire rather than a travestie of the exotic lyrical drama . It may be regarded as a species of prototype of the burletta or ballad opera of later days . Not even the transformed “ Tom Thumb "[ 1 ] could be called an effective reductio ad absurdum of the Italian opera of those days . For that the public had to wait a short time longer .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ Tom Thumb ” was performed in<date>1740</date>, with Yates as the ghost and Woodward as Noodle , Glumdalca ( the giantess ) being represented by a man . In<date>1745</date>Yates played Grizzle , Tom being enacted by a lady . The burlesque was seen at Covent Garden in<date>1828</date>. Meanwhile , four years after the production of “ Tom Thumb ” came the “ Chrononhotonthologos ” of Henry Carey , author of “ Sally in our Alley . ” This also is a burlesque tragedy , but the travestie is purely general . No individual play is directly satirised ; the satire is aimed at a whole class of dramas — the same class as that which had suggested the composition of “ Tom Thumb . ” Carey says , in his prologue :— To-night our comic muse the buskin wears , And gives herself no small romantic airs ; Struts in heroics , and in pompous verse Does the minutest incidents rehearse ; In ridicule 's strict retrospect displays The poetasters of these modern days , Who with big bellowing bombast rend our ears , Which , stript of sound , quite void of sense appears ; Or else their fiddle-faddle numbers flow , Serenely dull , elaborately low . “ Chrononhotonthologos ” is a short piece , in one act and seven scenes . It is described in its sub-title as “ the most tragical tragedy that ever was tragedised by any company of tragedians , ” and it bears out the description tolerably well . When the curtain rises , there enter two courtiers of Queerummania — Rigdum-Funnidos and Aldiborontiphoscophornio . Says the latter to the former :— Aldiborontiphoscophornio ! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos ? Chrononhotonthologos is the king , and we learn that he is in his tent , in a kind of waking slumber . Presently he enters , very much put out that he should be so inclined to doze , and very angry , consequently , with the God of Sleep . Says he :— Sport not with Chrononhotonthologos , Thou idle slumb'rer , thou detested Somnus ; and “ exits in a huff . ” Whereupon the two courtiers , who have retired , re-enter :— Rigdum . The King is in a most cursed passion ! Pray who is the Mr. Somnus he 's so angry withal ? Aldi . The son of Chaos and of Erebus , Incestuous pair ! brother of Mors relentless , Whose speckled robe , and wings of blackest hue , Astonish all mankind with hideous glare : Himself , with sable plumes , to men benevolent Brings downy slumbers and refreshing sleep . Rigdum . This gentleman may come of a very good family , for aught I know ; but I would not be in his place for the world . Aldi . But lo ! the king his footsteps this way bending , His cogitative faculties immers 'd In cogibundity of cogitation . Thereupon the king re-enters , followed almost immediately by the captain of the guard , who informs him that “ th ’ antipodean pow'rs from realms below have burst the entrails of the earth ” and threaten the safety of the kingdom . “ This world is too incopious to contain them ; armies on armies march in form stupendous ” — “ tier on tier , high pil 'd from earth to heaven . ” The king , however , is not alarmed . He bids Bombardinian , his general , draw his legions forth , and orders the priests to prepare their temples for rites of triumph :— Let the singing singers , With vocal voices , most vociferous , In sweet vociferation , out-vociferise Ev'n sound itself . Happily the Antipodeans ( who walk upon their hands ) are badly beaten , and all run away except their king , with whom , alas ! Fadladinida , the wife of Chrononhotonthologos , promptly falls in love . As she herself says to her favourite maiden :— Oh , my Tatlanthe ! Have you seen his face , His air , his shape , his mien , his ev'ry grace ? In what a charming attitude he stands , How prettily he foots it with his hands ! Well , to his arms — no , to his legs — I fly , For I must have him , if I live or die . Meanwhile , Bombardinian has invited the King to drink wine with him in his tent . The King accepts , but , not content with liquor , asks for something more substantial :— Hold , Bombardinian , I esteem it fit , With so much wine , to eat a little bit . The cook suggests “ some nice cold pork in the pantry , ” and is instantly slain by the irate monarch , who , deeming that Bombardinian is “ braving ” him , strikes him . Whereupon the General :— A blow ! shall Bombardinian take a blow ? Blush ! blush , thou sun ! start back , thou rapid ocean ! Hills ! vales ! seas ! mountains ! all commixing crumble , And into chaos pulverise the world ; For Bombardinian has receiv 'd a blow , And Chrononhotonthologos must die . [ They fight . He kills the king .</docImprint>

     <p>Ha ! what have I done ? Go , call a coach , and let a coach be call 'd ; And let the man that calls it be the caller ; And , in his calling , let him nothing call , But coach , coach , coach ! Oh , for a coach , ye gods ! [ Exit , raving . The doctor , pronouncing the king dead , is killed by the General , who then kills himself . The Queen mourns her widowhood , and Tatlanthe proposes that she should wed Rigdum-Funnidos . To this , however , Aldiborontiphoscophornio objects ; and so , to save discussion , the Queen will give no preference to either :— To make the matter easy , I 'll have you both ; and that , I hope , will please ye .</p>

    <docImprint>Produced in<date>1734</date>, “ Chrononhotonthologos ” was performed at intervals until<date>1815</date>, when it was seen at Drury Lane , with Oxberry in the title-part and Dowton as the General . After that it remained out of the theatrical repertory until<date>1880</date>, when Mr. John Hollingshead revived it , for one representation , at the Gaiety .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>It is a slight piece of work , but contains some elements of comicality . It will always be esteemed by literary students , if only because the names of Rigdum-Funnidos and Aldiborontiphoscophornio struck the fancy of Sir Walter Scott , who bestowed them , in fun , upon the brothers Constable , the publishers . “ Aldiborontiphoscophornio ” is surely the perfection of mock-tragedy nomenclature . It is to Carey that we owe , not only “ Chrononhotonthologos , ” but the first really effective burlesque of Italian opera . In<date>1737</date>there was brought out at the Haymarket “ The Dragon of Wantley , ” a “ burlesque opera , ” of which Carey had written the dialogue and songs , and for which John Frederick Lampe had composed the music . Its object , according to the author , was “ to display in English the beauty of nonsense , so prevailing in the Italian operas . ” The story was founded on the old ballad , with which , however , liberties were taken . In the first act , the natives of “ that part of Yorkshire near Rotherham ” are shown in much excitement , due to the ravages of the dragon , which has just entered the Squire 's residence and consumed all the coffee , toast , and butter that was set out for breakfast . Says one Gubbins :— This Dragon very modish , sure , and nice is : What shall we do in this disastrous crisis ? To which his daughter Margery replies :— A thought , to quell him , comes into my Head ; No Way more proper , than to kill him dead .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The parts of Chrononhotonthologos , Bombardinian , Rigdum-Funnidos , Aldiborontiphoscophornio , Fadladinida , and Tatlanthe were then taken by Messrs.

   <p>Not far hence lives “ a valiant knight , ” named Moore , of Moore Hall , who may be trusted to destroy the dragon . Moore accordingly is approached , surrenders to the charms of Margery , and undertakes to do the deed . Meanwhile , Mauxalinda , an old flame of Moore 's , becomes jealous of Margery , and seeks to slay her with a bodkin — a fate from which Moore happily rescues her . Mauxalinda is then threatened with quarter sessions ; but she cries —</p>

   <p>“ The music , ” says the chronicler , “ was made as grand and pompous as possible , to heighten the contrast between that and the words ” — thus anticipating the comic method which has been utilised with so much success by Mr. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan .</p>
   <p>From “ The Dragon of Wantley , ” which , as might be expected , had a very considerable vogue , we come to “ The Critic , or a Tragedy Rehearsed ” — the last , and not the least , of Sheridan 's dramatic works , produced in Drury Lane in 1779 . Of so familiar a piece , what is there to be said ? Is it not played with tolerable frequency at “ benefits , ” for the sake of the “ exceptional casts ” it can supply ? Have not all middle-aged playgoers seen and admired the younger Mathews as Sir Fretful Plagiary and Mr . Puff ? Assuredly there are certain features of “ The Critic ” which everybody remembers . Everybody remembers Sir Fretful 's famous lines on the plagiarists , who “ serve your best thoughts as gypsies do stolen children — disfigure them to make ‘ em pass for their own ” ; as well as his special addendum about the “ dexterous ” writer who “ might take out some of the best things in my tragedy and put them into his own comedy . ” Everybody remembers , too , Mr . Puffs no less famous catalogue of the varieties of reclame ; his remark that “ the number of those who undergo the fatigue of judging for themselves is very small indeed ” ; his explanation of the fact that he and Shakespeare had made use of the same thought ; Lord Burleigh 's shake of the head , which meant so much , and has become proverbial ; the Spanish fleet , which could not be seen because it was not yet in sight ; Tilburina , “ mad in white satin ” — and the like . It must be recollected , however , that “ The Critic ” as played and “ The Critic ” as written and printed are two very different things . In the acting version , the earlier scenes between Puff and Dangle and Sneer , as well as the latter portion of the “ tragedy rehearsed , ” are very much compressed — no doubt with advantage to the public , for , clever as “ The Critic ” is as a whole , certain portions of it are out of date , and would not “ go ” well with a modern audience .</p>
   <p>In glancing through the printed version , one is struck anew by the similarity that “ The Critic ” bears to “ The Rehearsal , ” not only in form , but in detail . In both cases a dramatic author rehearses a tragedy in the presence of a couple of friends , who interject comments upon the performance . But the likeness does not end here — possibly because the theatrical world of 1779 was , in all essentials , very like the theatrical world of 1671 . Bayes , in “ The Rehearsal , ” says that he has “ appointed two or three dozen ” of his friends “ to be ready in the pit ” ( at the premiere of his piece ) , “ who , I 'm sure , will clap . ” And so Sneer , in “ The Critic , ” expects that he will not be able to get into Drury Lane on the first night of Puff 's play , “ for on the first night of a piece they always fill the house with orders to support it . ” Again , Bayes says that</p>
   <p>Let a man write never so well , there are , nowadays , a sort of persons they call critics , that , egad , have no more wit in them than so many hobby-horses ; but they 'll laugh at you , sir , and find fault , and censure things that , egad , I 'm sure they are not able to do themselves .</p>
   <p>In a similar spirit Sir Fretful stigmatises the newspapers as “ the most villainous — licentious — abominable — infernal —— Not that I ever read them — no . I make it a rule never to look into a newspaper . ”</p>
   <p>In one respect Sheridan 's work is quite unlike the Duke of Buckingham 's . It contains no direct travestie or parody of any kind . The burlesque is “ at large ” throughout . The satire embodied in the dialogue between Puff and his friends reflects upon all old-fashioned playwriting of the “ tragic ” sort . Puff opens the second scene of his “ Spanish Armada ” with a clock striking four , which , besides recording the time , not only “ begets an awful attention in the audience , ” but “ saves a description of the rising sun , and a great deal about gilding the eastern hemisphere . ” He makes his characters tell one another what they know already , because , although they know it , the audience do not . He hears the stage cannon go off three times instead of once , and complains , “ Give these fellows a good thing , and they never know when to have done with it . ” “ Where they do agree on the stage , ” he says , in another hackneyed passage , “ their unanimity is wonderful . ” In the rehearsed tragedy itself the travestie is general , not particular . Here Sheridan satirises a different class of tragedy from that which Buckingham dealt with . As the prologue ( not by Sheridan , however ) says :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In those gay days of wickedness and wit ,</l>
     <l n="2">When Villiers criticised what Dryden writ ,</l>
     <l n="3">The tragic queen , to please a tasteless crowd ,</l>
     <l n="4">Had learn 'd to bellow , rant , and roar so loud ,</l>
     <l n="5">That frighten 'd Nature , her best friend before ,</l>
     <l n="6">The blustering beldam 's company forswore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">The later “ tragedy ” took another tone :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">The frantic hero 's wild delirium past ,</l>
     <l n="9">Now insipidity succeeds bombast ;</l>
     <l n="10">So slow Melpomene 's cold numbers creep ,</l>
     <l n="11">Here dulness seems her drowsy court to keep .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Dulness , then , is what Sheridan is chiefly girding at , but he has a keen eye also for the unconscious banalities of the genre he is dealing with . How truly comic , for instance , is the prayer to Mars offered up by Leicester and his companions !—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Behold thy votaries submissive beg</l>
     <l n="2">That thou wilt deign to grant them all they ask ;</l>
     <l n="3">Assist them to accomplish all their ends ,</l>
     <l n="4">And sanctify whatever means they use</l>
     <l n="5">To gain them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">How delicious , too , in their absolute nonsense , are the lines given to</l>
     <l n="7">the distraught Tilburina !—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">The wind whistles — the moon rises — see ,</l>
     <l n="9">They have killed my squirrel in his cage ;</l>
     <l n="10">Is this a grasshopper ?— Ha ! no ; it is my</l>
     <l n="11">Whiskerandos — you shall not keep him —</l>
     <l n="12">I know you have him in your pocket —</l>
     <l n="13">An oyster may be cross 'd in love !— who says</l>
     <l n="14">A whale 's a bird ?— Ha ! did you call , my love ?—</l>
     <l n="15">He 's here ! he 's there !— He 's everywhere !</l>
     <l n="16">Ah me ! he 's nowhere !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>For the rest , the text of the tragedy , as printed , is very dissimilar from the text as played . In representation , most of the fun is got out of intentional perversion of certain words or phrases . Thus , “ martial symmetry ” becomes “ martial cemetery ” ;</p>
   <p>The famed Armada , by the Pope baptised ,</p>
   <p>becomes</p>
   <p>The famed Armada , by the Pope capsised ;</p>
   <p>“ friendship 's closing line ” is turned into “ friendship 's clothes-line ” ; “ My gentle Nora ” into “ My gentle Snorer ” ; “ Cupid 's baby woes ” into “ Cupid 's baby clothes ” ; “ matchless excellence ” into “ matchless impudence , ” and so on . This is sorry stuff ; and those who desire to appreciate Sheridan 's travestie of the tragedy of his day must read “ The Critic ” in its published shape .</p>
   <p>The next notable attempt at the burlesque of conventional tragedy was a return to the methods of “ Chrononhotonthologos . ” In “ Bombastes Furioso ” ( first played in 1816 [ 3 ]) all satirical machinery was discarded ; all that the author — William Barnes Rhodes — sought to do was to travestie his originals in a brief and telling story . “ Bombastes ” is not now so often performed as it used to be ; but not so very long ago it was turned into a comic opera , under the title of “ Artaxominous the Great , ” and its humours are fairly well known to the public . Some of these the world will not willingly let die . One still thinks with amusement of the “ army ” of Bombastes , consisting of “ one Drummer , one Fifer , and two Soldiers , all very materially differing in size ” ; of the General 's exhortation to his troops —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The elder Mathews was Artaxominous ; Liston , Bombardinian ; and Miss</l>
     <l n="2">H. Kelly , Distaffina . A few years later Munden played Bombardinian , and</l>
     <l n="3">Farren , Fusbos .</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And the piece bears re-perusal wonderfully well . Its literary merit is assuredly not less than that of “ Chrononhotonthologos ": it is perhaps even greater . The opening colloquy between the King and Fusbos is genuinely diverting , embodying as it does one of those mock similes so dear to the satirists of old-fashioned tragedy . The King admits to Fusbos that he is “ but middling — that is , so so ! ” It is not , however , either the mulligrubs or the blue-devils that disturb him :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">King . Last night , when undisturb 'd by state affairs ,</l>
     <l n="2">Moist'ning our clay , and puffing off our cares ,</l>
     <l n="3">Oft the replenish 'd goblet did we drain ,</l>
     <l n="4">And drank and smok 'd , and smok 'd and drank again !</l>
     <l n="5">Such was the case , our very actions such ,</l>
     <l n="6">Until at length we got a drop too much .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Fusbos . So when some donkey on the Blackheath road ,</l>
     <l n="8">Falls , overpower 'd , beneath his sandy load ,</l>
     <l n="9">The driver 's curse unheeded swells the air ,</l>
     <l n="10">Since none can carry more than they can bear .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>By-and-by the King confides to Fusbos that his heart is not wholly faithful to Queen Griskinissa — that he is also hopelessly in love with Distaffina , the acknowledged sweetheart of Bombastes . Under the circumstances he asks for Fusbos ’ advice :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Shall I my Griskinissa 's charms forego ,</l>
     <l n="2">Compel her to give up the regal chair ,</l>
     <l n="3">And place the rosy Distaffina there ?</l>
     <l n="4">In such a case , what course can I pursue ?</l>
     <l n="5">I love my queen , and Distaffina too .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Fusbos . And would a king his general supplant ?</l>
     <l n="7">I can n't advise , upon my soul I can n't .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">King . So when two feasts , whereat there 's nought to pay ,</l>
     <l n="9">Fall unpropitious on the self-same day ,</l>
     <l n="10">The anxious Cit each invitation views ,</l>
     <l n="11">And ponders which to take and which refuse :</l>
     <l n="12">From this or that to keep away is loth ,</l>
     <l n="13">And sighs to think he cannot dine at both .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>These , however , are not the best known of the mock similes in “ Bombastes . ” For those we have to look to the scene in which the King , observing his General 's abovementioned challenge , reviles Bombastes and knocks down his boots . Then we have the familiar lines :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Bomb . So have I heard on Afric 's burning shore</l>
     <l n="2">A hungry lion give a grievous roar ;</l>
     <l n="3">The grievous roar echo 'd along the shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">King . So have I heard on Afric 's burning shore</l>
     <l n="5">Another lion give a grievous roar ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the first lion thought the last a bore .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Next comes the fight between the monarch and the warrior ; the King is killed , and then Fusbos kills Bombastes . Finally , the two deceased ( despite the assertion of Fusbos that they are “ dead as herrings — herrings that are red ” ) come to life again , and all ends happily .</p>
   <p>Of ordinary parody there is little in the piece , and what there is can scarcely be said to be of the best . There is a suggestion , in one ditty , of “ Hope told a flattering Tale . ” But better than this is the song suggested by “ My Lodging is on the Cold Ground , ” which is happy both intrinsically and as an imitation . Fusbos is the singer :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My lodging is in Leather Lane ,</l>
     <l n="2">A parlour that 's next to the sky ;</l>

     <l n="4">But the wind and the rain I defy :</l>
     <l n="5">Such love warms the coldest of spots ,</l>
     <l n="6">As I feel for Scrubinda the fair ;</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>At this point , English stage burlesque suddenly takes a new departure , combining , with satire of the contemporary native “ boards , ” satire not less keen of certain products of the foreign muse . The incident came about in this way :— Just before the close of the eighteenth century , the English book-market had been flooded with translations of certain German plays , including Schiller 's “ Robbers ” and “ Cabal and Love , ” Goethe 's “ Stella , ” and Kotzebue 's “ Misanthropy and Repentance ” ( “ The Stranger ” ) and “ Count Benyowsky . ” Canning , Ellis , and Frere , who were then bringing out The Anti-Jacobin , were struck by the absurdities contained within these dramas , and accordingly composed and printed ( in June 1798 ) that well-known skit , “ The Rovers , or the Double Arrangement . ” In this the plays chiefly parodied are “ Stella , ” “ The Stranger , ” and “ Count Benyowsky . ” By “ Stella ” was suggested not only “ the double arrangement ” ( by which Matilda and Cecilia share the affections of their lover Casimere ) , but the famous scene in which the two women , before they know they are rivals , become , on the instant , bosom friends . Both admit that they are in love , and then —</p>
   <p>Cecilia . Your countenance grows animated , my dear madam .</p>
   <p>Matilda . And yours is glowing with illumination .</p>
   <p>Cecilia . I had long been looking out for a congenial spirit ! My heart was withered , but the beams of yours have rekindled it .</p>
   <p>Matilda . A sudden thought strikes me : let us swear an eternal friendship .</p>
   <p>Cecilia . Let us agree to live together !</p>
   <p>Matilda . Willingly .</p>
   <p>Cecilia . Let us embrace .</p>

   <p>“ The Rovers , ” however , would hardly come within the scope of the present volume , were it not that , in 1811 , at the Haymarket , there was produced , by Colman junior , a piece called “ The Quadrupeds of Quedlinburgh , or the Rovers of Weimar , ” in which the adapter made use of the squib in The Anti-Jacobin . Colman 's aim in this work was to ridicule not only the German plays , including Kotzebue 's “ Spaniards in Peru ” ( “ Pizarro ” ) , which had lately been brought before the English playgoer , but also the prevailing fancy for bringing animals upon the stage . At Astley 's horses had figured both in “ Blue Beard ” and in “ Timour the Tartar , ” and dogs had previously been seen in “ The Caravan . ” To this , as well as to the unhealthy importations from Germany , allusion was made in the prologue :—</p>

   <p>“ The Quadrupeds of Quedlinburgh ” was not printed , and one does not know to what extent Colman took advantage of the text of “ The Rovers . ” It is certain , however , that Casimere , Matilda , and Cecilia , as well as Rogero ( a creation of the original parodists ) , all appeared in the burlesque , being enacted respectively by Munden , Mrs. Glover , Mrs. Gibbs , and Liston , Elliston taking the role of Bartholomew Bathos , a lineal descendant ( no doubt ) of Bayes and Puff . We read that , in addition to the travestie supplied by The Anti-Jacobin , fun was poked at the sentimental sentinel in “ Pizarro , ” and the last scene of “ Timour the Tartar ” was closely imitated . The piece was acted thirty-nine times , and must therefore have been what , in those days , was accounted a success .</p>
   <p>We come now to a travestie of the old-fashioned tragedy which helps to connect the Old burlesque with the New , inasmuch as it was the production of James Robinson Planche . Of his “ Amoroso , King of Little Britain : a serio-comick bombastick operatick interlude , ” played at Drury Lane in 1818 , Planche was not particularly proud . He was very young when he wrote it ; he wrote it for amateur performance ; and it got on to the stage of Drury Lane without his knowledge and consent . Harley , the comedian , appears to have seen or read the little trifle , and to have recommended it to the manager of “ the national theatre . ” He himself represented Amoroso ; Knight was Roastando ( a cook ) ; Smith was Blusterbus ( a yeoman of the guard ) ; Mrs . Bland was Coquetinda ( the Queen of Little Britain ) , and Mrs. Orger was Mollidusta ( a chambermaid ) . The piece was much applauded , and had the distinction of being quoted in the Times . It opens with the King being awakened by his courtiers , to whom he angrily exclaims :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Leave at what time you please your truckle beds —</l>
     <l n="2">But if you break my rest I 'll break your heads .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">I swear I 'm quite disordered with this rout .</l>
     <l n="4">Ahem ! My lords and gentlemen — get out !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Times applied the last line to a Parliamentary incident which had just occurred ; and Planche admits that he was flattered by the compliment . But he would not include “ Amoroso ” in the testimonial edition of his burlesques and extravaganzas ,— mainly , I imagine , because the piece is so obviously an imitation of “ Bombastes Furioso , ” which it by no means equals in literary distinction .</p>
   <p>The plot is simplicity itself . Amoroso is in love with Mollidusta , Mollidusta with Blusterbus , and the Queen with Roastando . “ The King sees Roastando and the Queen salute : he discharges Roastando . The Queen sees the King and Mollidusta together : she stabs Mollidusta . The King stabs the Queen , Roastando stabs the King , the King stabs Roastando . ” In the end , all come to life again . In the course of the play the King thus declares his passion to Mollidusta :—</p>

   <p>Three months after “ Amoroso ” had been seen at Drury Lane , there was produced at the English Opera House a “ serio-comic-bombastic-operatic interlude , ” written by George Daniel , and called “ Doctor Bolus ” — yet another burlesque of the old-fashioned drama , owing quite as much to “ Bombastes Furioso ” as did “ Amoroso . ” In this piece the King , Artipadiades ( Harley ) , is in love with Poggylina , a maid of honour , while the Queen , Katalinda ( Miss Kelly ) , is enamoured of General Scaramoucho ( Chatterley ) . The General revolts , and is defeated by the King . His amour is discovered , and , while the Queen is poisoned with one of Bolus 's “ infallible ” pills , the General is stabbed by Artipadiades . The Queen , however , revives , and is thereupon stabbed by the King , who also stabs himself . But , in the end , as in “ Amoroso , ” all the dead people are resuscitated . There are some gleams of humour in the dialogue , but not many . Bolus was played by John Wilkinson .</p>
   <p>II .</p>
   <p>THE “ PALMY ” DAYS .</p>
   <p>After the production of “ Amoroso , ” Planche remained silent , so far as travestie was concerned , till 1831 , when he began in earnest his successful career as a burlesque writer . In the interval a new votary of travestie appeared in the person of Fox Cooper , of whose “ Elbow Shakers ” and “ Ion ” I shall have something to say by-and-by . Moncrieff and Buckstone , too , followed the example of T. Dibdin , in dealing more or less humorously with the subject of “ Don Giovanni , ” while Buckstone also essayed to do the same with that of “ Billy Taylor . ” None of these effusions , however , were burlesques in the ordinary acceptation of the word ; and 1831 , therefore , may still be taken as the starting-point of the new theatrical era , of which Planche was the herald .</p>
   <p>This era may be said to divide naturally into fairly balanced parts , the first extending from 1831 to 1865 , the period covered by Planche 's activity in the work ; the second from 1865 to 1885 , by which time Mr. Edward Terry and Miss Kate Vaughan had retired from the Gaiety . Within the former moiety are comprised the labours of four men who for many years shared with Planche the throne of stage travestie . Need I say that I mean Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett ( with whom Mark Lemon so frequently collaborated ) , Francis Talfourd , and the Brothers Brough ? Planche 's “ Olympic Revels ” ( 1831 ) was followed by A'Beckett ' s “ Son of the Sun ” in 1834 , by Talfourd 's “ Macbeth ” in 1847 , and by the Brothers Brough 's “ Enchanted Isle ” in 1848 . The “ Joan of Arc ” of William Brough was seen in 1869 ; its writer had been producing burlesque for over twenty years . Talfourd 's career as a dramatist was comparatively brief . Beginning in 1847 , it ended in 1860 , but was brilliant while it lasted .</p>
   <p>Modern burlesque was fortunate indeed in its founders — all of them men of education and refinement , all of them men of letters as well as playwrights . To the literary merit of their products it is unnecessary to bear more than the briefest testimony , for it is everywhere , and by everybody , acknowledged . In the writings of these four men theatrical burlesque was seen at its best . They came fresh to the task , and made the most of their opportunities . They set themselves really to travestie and to parody , and were careful to present , amid their wildest comicalities , a definite , intelligible story . They dropped naturally into the decasyllabic couplet , and made free use of the pun ; but in neither case did they become mechanical or strained . The verse of Planche and A'Beckett is smoothness itself , and they do not descend to word-torturing . Talfourd and the Broughs took more licence in this latter respect , but they never sank into drivel . Above all , not one of these five masters of burlesque permitted themselves to be vulgar either in general treatment or in verbal detail . They were nice in their choice of subjects , and , like Mr. W. S. Gilbert in the case of “ The Princess , ” perverted them respectfully . One finds no horseplay in the fun of these genuine humourists . All their effects are made legitimately , and in decent fashion .</p>
   <p>They were happy , too , in the good influence they exercised . The list of their colleagues during the period named is notable . One meets early with the names of Charles Selby and W. H. Oxberry . Then come those of Albert Smith , Kenny , and Shirley Brooks , Leicester Buckingham , and Andrew Halliday , by whom much excellent work was achieved in the ‘ forties and ‘ fifties . Of lesser note , in this particular department of endeavour , were Leman Rede , Stirling Coyne , and Tom Taylor , who were more distinguished in other fields . Selby and Oxberry had the knack of writing for the stage which so often results from experience in acting . Smith , Brooks , Buckingham , Halliday , Rede , Coyne , and Taylor , were men whose literary skill , acquired in other quarters , was of eminent service to the comic stage . Especially is it to be regretted that the genial and witty author of “ Sooner or Later ” did not devote more of his time and talent to the service of burlesque , of the qualities and possibilities of which he had so keen a sense .</p>
   <p>But to turn now to the second moiety of the period above named — that extending from 1865 to 1885 . We find that this , too , has had the good fortune to be dominated by some burlesque writers of very special capacity — to wit , Mr. F. C. Burnand , the late H. J. Byron , Mr. W. S. Gilbert , and Mr. Robert Reece . Mr. Burnand has been bringing out burlesques ever since 1855 , when he wrote “ Villikins and his Dinah ” for the Cambridge A. D. C . His first London production was his “ Dido , ” seen at the St. James 's in 1860 . His metropolitan career , therefore , has covered more than thirty years . Byron began at the Strand in 1858 , and ended at the Gaiety in 1879 . Mr. Gilbert 's labours as a producer of travestie in the ordinary sense started early in the ‘ sixties with “ Dr. Dulcamara , ” and closed in 1870 with “ The Princess . "[ 4 ] Mr. Reece opened in 1865 with “ Prometheus ” ; and work in which he had a part was witnessed so recently as 1886 .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>In the preparation of “ The Happy Land ” ( 1873 ) Mr. Gilbert had only a share , the scenario being his , but nearly all the writing being done by Mr. Gilbert Arthur a'Beckett .</p>
   <p>Mr. Gilbert soon found that his true metier lay outside the bounds of ordinary burlesque , and his “ Princess ” was the stepping-stone to “ The Palace of Truth , ” and , in due course , to “ H. M. S . Pinafore ” and its successors . His travesties of “ L'Elisir d'Amore , ” “ La Fille du Regiment , ” “ The Bohemian Girl , ” “ Norma , ” and “ Robert le Diable , ” had , however , what all the best specimens of English stage burlesque have had — a literary quality and an entire absence of coarseness or suggestiveness ; and no doubt they had , at the time , their due effect upon the public taste . Meanwhile , the premier burlesque writers of the past thirty years are Mr. Burnand , Byron , and Mr. Reece , whose productions have been as notable for their multiplicity and variety as for their technical excellence . All three , like the ablest of their predecessors , have written extravaganza as well as travestie ; and , in travestie , they have gone far afield , essaying and succeeding in all subjects and all styles . They , too , have favoured , in the main , the decasyllabic couplet and the pun , bringing both of them to all the comic perfection of which they were capable . The pun , in particular , has reached its highest phase in the writings of these consummate jugglers with words .</p>
   <p>Mr. H. B. Farnie had a considerable vogue in burlesque from 1870 to 1885 , but never displayed the neatness or the spontaneity of the writers above mentioned . He was fluent , but that was all . Mr. Alfred Thompson at one time did good things in this direction , and so did Mr. Conway Edwardes . Mr. G. A. Sala composed one burlesque , but has not been induced to give it a successor . Mr. Herman Merivale has been content to write two : that he has not written more is to be regretted . Among other recent writers of travestie may be named — Mr. Gilbert Arthur a'Beckett , Mr. Harry Paulton , Mr. F. W. Green , Mr. Arthur Matthison , Mr. Savile Clarke , Mr. W. Younge , Mr. Edward Rose , Mr. Alfred Murray , Mr. Albert Chevalier , Mr. George Dance , Mr. G. P. Hawtrey , Mr. Horace Lennard , Mr. Geoffrey Thorn , and Mr. Cecil Raleigh . In the provinces great successes have been made by Mr. J. McArdle and Mr. Wilton Jones . Of Messrs. Sims and Pettitt , Stephens and Yardley , “ Richard Henry , ” and “ A. C. Torr ” and H. Mills , I shall have something to say when I come to consider “ The New Burlesque , ” of which they have been the principal producers . If , within the last twenty years or so , travestie has been confined to a smaller number of theatres than before , and if it has been proportionately “ depressed , ” that has been owing , chiefly , to the popularity of comic opera and farcical comedy , into the composition and exposition of which has been thrown , of necessity , very much of the talent which otherwise would have been devoted to the writing and acting of burlesque .</p>
   <p>On the whole , the days between 1831 and 1885 were , for burlesque , “ palmy ” days indeed . They produced not only many admirable writers of the genre , but many admirable actors thereof . Planche was generous in his praise of the artists who helped so greatly to make his pieces “ go ” ; and he did well to be so , for never , I suppose , was a comic writer so fortunate in his interpreters . During his first years at the Olympic he had the aid of the incomparable Vestris , of Rebecca Isaacs , of Miss Murray , of Mrs. Macnamara , of Mrs. Honey , of John Brougham , of James Bland , of James Vining , and of Charles James Mathews ,— all in the first rank of their art . At Covent Garden , from 1840 to 1843 , the company included , at different times , not only Mme . Vestris , Mrs. Macnamara , Brougham , Bland , and Vining , but Harley , Wm . Harrison , Morris Barnett , Selby , Miss Fairbrother , Miss Priscilla Horton , Mrs. C. Jones , and Mrs. Alfred Wigan . At the Haymarket , during the three years following , Planche had his ideas carried out , not only by Bland and Miss Horton , and during one year by Mme . Vestris and Charles Mathews , but also by Caulfield , Widdicomb , Tilbury , Brindal , Braid , Julia Bennett , Miss Reynolds , and Mrs. L. S. Buckingham . Continuously lucky in this respect , Planche enjoyed — from 1847 to 1853 , at the Lyceum — the services of Miss Fitzwilliam , Julia St. George , Miss Oliver , John Reeve , Robert Roxby , Basil Baker , and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Matthews , in addition to Vestris and Mathews and many others of the artists named above . Finally , and best , when Planche brought out , at the Olympic , his “ Yellow Dwarf , ” his “ Discreet Princess , ” and his “ Young and Handsome , ” his chief comedian was the “ great little Robson , ” the fame of whose tragi-comic outbursts still lingers among us , and who had for his successive supporters Horace Wigan , Emery , James Rogers , Julia St. George , Miss Maskell ( Mrs. Walter Baynham ) , and Miss Swanborough .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">What , meanwhile , had been the personnel at the other houses of</l>
     <l n="2">burlesque ? At the Strand in the ‘ thirties , the great favourites were</l>
     <l n="3">W. J. Hammond , H. Hall , Mitchell , Oxberry , G. Cooke , Miss Daly , Miss</l>
     <l n="4">Horton . At the Fitzroy one finds Miss Chaplin and W. Rogers ; at the</l>
     <l n="5">Victoria , Rogers and Mitchell ; at the St. James 's , Hall and Mme .</l>
     <l n="6">Sala ; at Sadler 's Wells , Rogers and C. H. Pitt ; at the Queen 's , T. F .</l>
     <l n="7">Matthews and Mrs. Selby ; and at the Adelphi , O Smith , John Reeve , and</l>
     <l n="8">Mrs. Stirling . Early in the ‘ forties we see Wright and Paul Bedford</l>
     <l n="9">moving from the Princess 's to the Adelphi , where Miss Chaplin and Miss</l>
     <l n="10">Woolgar are also located . At the Strand we find Wigan , Hammond , and</l>
     <l n="11">R. Romer . Later , we come across Keeley in burlesque at the Haymarket ,</l>
     <l n="12">along with Bland , Miss Reynolds , and Miss Horton . The second half of</l>
     <l n="13">the century opens brilliantly at the Strand , where Reeve , Rogers ,</l>
     <l n="14">Romer , and Maskell are the male comedians , with Miss Marshall , Miss</l>
     <l n="15">Romer , Miss Maskell , and Mrs. Horsman as their helpmates . Was not that</l>
     <l n="16">a truly strong company ? And was not the Adelphi fortunate , about the</l>
     <l n="17">same time , in the possession of Miss Woolgar , Miss Mary Keeley , Keeley</l>
     <l n="18">himself , and Paul Bedford ? At the Haymarket were Buckstone and Mrs .</l>
     <l n="19">Caulfield . Some of these may be names only to the uninstructed reader ;</l>
     <l n="20">but to the theatrical student they all convey a world of meaning ,</l>
     <l n="21">conjuring up a multitude of delightful associations .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When we come to 1856 we reach a landmark in the history of burlesque acting . William Brough 's “ Perdita ” is “ put up ” by Charles Dillon at the Lyceum , and in the cast of it we find not only Miss Woolgar and the author , but that very youthful actress Marie Wilton , and that rising young comedian J. L. Toole . Here , then , is the beginning of the modern regime . Robson and Julia St. George are still playing at the Olympic ; but the “ palmy ” days of the Strand Theatre are about to flash upon us . Marie Wilton stays for another year at the Lyceum , but in 1858 she is comfortably lodged at the little playhouse across the way , together with Bland and Poynter and Mrs. Selby , and Johnny Clarke , H. J. Turner , and Miss Ternan . In 1859 Charlotte Saunders is playing a mock Romeo to Marie Wilton 's mock Juliet , and Eleanor Bufton and Maria Simpson and “ Jimmy ” Rogers are also members of the troupe — the one troupe which can regard itself as the legitimate successor to the Vestris-Mathews “ combinations . ” In the year following , a new star arises at the Lyceum in the person of Lydia Thompson ; at the St. James 's are Nelly Moore and Cecilia Ranoe and Charles Young ; at the Haymarket are Chippendale , Compton , and C. Coghlan . A few months more , and the name of Kate Terry appears on the burlesque bill at the St. James 's . Fanny Josephs and E. Danvers have been added to the Strand establishment , which shortly welcomes Fanny Hughes and Ada Swanborough , Polly Marshall and George Honey .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Next comes the turn of the little Royalty . We are in 1863 , and Mr .</l>
     <l n="2">Burnand 's “ Ixion ” is announced , with Jenny Wilmore in the title-part ,</l>
     <l n="3">David James as Mercury , Felix Rogers as Minerva , Mrs. Charles Selby as</l>
     <l n="4">the Queen , and Ada Cavendish as Venus . Here , again , is a landmark , not</l>
     <l n="5">to be left unnoted ; here we have to record the first of many triumphs</l>
     <l n="6">to come . Next year both David James and Thomas Thorne are in the troupe</l>
     <l n="7">at the Strand , where they are destined to remain till they open the</l>
     <l n="8">Vaudeville in 1870 . In the year next again , the burlesque company at</l>
     <l n="9">the Olympic is seen to include a young actress of the name of Ellen</l>
     <l n="10">Farren , one day to become the chief tender of the “ sacred lamp ” ; along</l>
     <l n="11">with her are Amy Sheridan , Louisa Moore , Patti Josephs , and Mrs .</l>
     <l n="12">Stephens . Meanwhile , the Royalty has been running neck and neck with</l>
     <l n="13">the Strand , and growing greatly in public favour . By 1866 it is ripe</l>
     <l n="14">for another success — the most remarkable ever achieved on the burlesque</l>
     <l n="15">boards — secured by the “ Black-eyed Susan ” of Mr. Burnand , with Fred</l>
     <l n="16">Dewar as Captain Crosstree , Mr. Charles Wyndham as a Deal smuggler ,</l>
     <l n="17">Miss Oliver as Susan , Miss Nellie Bromley as Dolly Mayflower , and E .</l>
     <l n="18">Danvers as Dame Hatley . After this one notes the addition to the Strand</l>
     <l n="19">troupe , first , of Miss Eliza Johnstone , Miss Elise Holt , and Miss</l>
     <l n="20">Weathersby ; and next , of Miss Lydia Thompson . At the New Queen 's in</l>
     <l n="21">1868 , Miss Kate Santley and Miss Henrietta Hodson are playing burlesque</l>
     <l n="22">with W. H. Stephens and “ Lal ” Brough . In the same year the Gaiety</l>
     <l n="23">Theatre is opened , by Mr. John Hollingshead with a new burlesque by Mr .</l>
     <l n="24">W. S. Gilbert — “ Robert the Devil , ” in which the leading character is</l>
     <l n="25">undertaken by Miss Ellen Farren .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>From this date onwards it is not necessary to do more than indicate a few salient points in connection with burlesque acting in this country . The opening of the Gaiety was the first step towards the expansion of the Old burlesque into the New . In the following year Mr. Edward Terry entered on an engagement at the Strand — an engagement which lasted till 1877 , and did as much for the progress of stage travestie as did that of Miss Farren at the other house . In 1869 there was burlesque at the Globe , with Edward Marshall and Miss Maggie Brennan , and at the St. James 's with Mrs. John Wood in “ La Belle Sauvage . "[ 5 ] In 1870 Harry Paulton went to the Strand ; and at the Royalty were Rachel Sanger , Arthur Wood , and Alfred Bishop . In 1871 there was burlesque at the Court , with Mlle . D'Anka , Miss Oliver , Miss Kate Bishop and Mr. Righton . At the Vaudeville , next year , Miss Nelly Power and Miss Marie Rhodes were supporting Messrs. James and Thorne ; while at the Royalty were Miss Emma Chambers , Miss Kate Phillips , and Miss Harriett Coveney .</p>

   <p>It is from this point that we may date the foundation of the New Burlesque , to which I shall return in my last chapter . In the chapters that immediately follow we shall be able to see how numerous were the topics essayed by burlesque writers in the “ palmy ” days , and also with how much wit and humour those writers were able , for the most part , to charge the stories that they told and the pictures that they presented .</p>

    <head>“ CLASSICAL ” BURLESQUE .</head>
    <head>Planche was not only the founder of modern burlesque : he was the originator , in particular , of that form of travestie which is commonly described as “ classical ” — which deals with the characteristics and adventures of the gods and goddesses , heroes and heroines , of the Greek and Latin mythology and fable . It is true that comic pieces on classical subjects had been played in England before Planche brought out , at the Olympic , his “ Olympic Revels "[ 6 ] ( January 1831 ) . But these pieces were not burlesques in the present-century sense of the word . Take , for example , the “ Midas ” of Kane O'Hara , which , produced in 1762 , remained popular for so many years , and will always be remembered as including the once famous ditty :—</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Pray , goody , please to moderate the rancour of your tongue :</l>
     <l n="2">Why flash those sparks of fury from your eyes ?</l>
     <l n="3">Remember , where the judgment 's weak the prejudice is strong ,</l>
     <l n="4">A stranger why will you despise ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5"><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>In “ Olympic Revels , ” as in some other pieces , Planche had the</l>
     <l n="6">valuable assistance of Charles Dance .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The gods and goddesses are presented in “ Midas ” in a light more or less ludicrous , and the dialogue , songs , and choruses are flavoured with contemporary allusion , more or less humorous . But the form given to the work is that of the old-fashioned burletta . Indeed , the chief merit of “ Midas , ” from a historical point of view , lies in the fact that it was its successful revival , with Mme . Vestris as Apollo , which , coupled with the publication of Colman junior 's story , “ The Sun-Poker , ” suggested to Planche the composition of his first “ classical ” burlesque . This had for subject the story of Prometheus and Pandora , and was remarkable , not only for the smooth flow of its versification and the general refinement of its tone , but also for the accuracy and consistency of the costumes , which were throughout “ classical , ” and therefore in strong contrast to the haphazard , incongruous attire in which “ classical ” characters had hitherto been exhibited on the comic boards .</p>
   <p>Prometheus and Pandora , I may note , figured later — in 1865 — as the leading personages in Mr. Reece 's “ Prometheus , or the Man on the Rock ,"[ 7 ] in which the writer differed from his predecessor in admitting into his dialogue a large infusion of the punning element . In this direction Mr. Reece has always been proficient . Here are a few specimens of his work , picked out at random :—</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Byron also wrote a burlesque in which Prometheus figures — “ Pandora 's Box , ” seen at the Prince of Wales 's in 1866 .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Planche 's “ Olympic Revels ” proved so brilliantly successful that he was encouraged to follow it up , at the end of the year , with a companion composition — “ Olympic Devils , or Orpheus and Eurydice . ” In this work , James Bland , the son of the lady who “ created ” Planche 's Coquetinda , made his first appearance in burlesque , and among the female Bacchantes who took part in the groupings was a clever young girl , named Leonora Pincott , who was destined one day to be a great public favourite as “ Mrs. Alfred Wigan . ” In “ Olympic Devils ” Planche 's style is seen to excellent effect . Note , as an instance , the remarks addressed by Minos , Lord Low Chancellor , to the Fates :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I vow you Fates are most industrious spinsters !</l>

     <l n="5">Taking great pains , but giving little pleasures .</l>

     <l n="7">And cuts poor mortals off without a shilling .</l>

     <l n="9">Daughter , indeed , of shear necessity !</l>
     <l n="10">Plying her awful task with due decorum ,</l>
     <l n="11">A never-ceasing game of “ snip-snap-snorum ” !</l>
     <l n="12">For help , alas ! man pleads to her in vain —</l>
     <l n="13">Her motto 's “ Cut and never come again . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">Elsewhere Orpheus says to Eurydice :—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">

     <l n="16">Mad as a March hare — oh , ma chere amie !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But Planche had a higher wit than that of punning . His satire and sarcasm have an agreeable , because not too pungent , cynicism — as in such little scraps of song as this ( following upon the scene in which Orpheus , hearing that his wife is flirting with Pluto , cannot resist looking back at her and thus consigning her again to Pluto 's tender mercies ):—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Orpheus . I have looked back — in your snare I am caught , sir —</l>
     <l n="2">Pluto , thou'st cut a fond pair to the core !</l>
     <l n="3">Oh , have I come all this way to be taught , sir ,</l>
     <l n="4">That folks who would thrive must keep looking before ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Euryd . You have looked back — in the snare you are caught , sir —</l>
     <l n="6">They who cheat him , faith , have none to cheat more !</l>
     <l n="7">A man of the world — have you yet to be taught , sir ,</l>
     <l n="8">When your wife flirts behind you , to look straight before ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In after years H. J. Byron wrote two burlesques on the legend of Orpheus and his wife , both of them produced at the Strand Theatre ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>and it is notable that when Planche made , in 1865 , at the Haymarket , his last appearance as a writer of extravaganza , it fell to his lot to treat once more of Orpheus and his surroundings .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>In 1863 and 1871 .</p>

   <p>Planche 's third classical burlesque was “ The Paphian Bower , or Venus and Adonis , ” in which Benjamin Webster was seen for the first time in this class of histrionic work . Mme . Vestris , of course , was Venus , and in the course of the piece had to sing this eminently clever parody of “ Sally in our Alley ":—</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Venus and Adonis have always been great favourites with the producers</l>
     <l n="18">of travestie . Among those who have made them the central figures of</l>
     <l n="19">burlesque are Mr. Burnand , whose work was brought out in 1864 , and</l>
     <l n="20">Mr. Edward Rose , whose “ Venus , ” written in collaboration with the Mr .</l>
     <l n="21">Augustus Harris , and first performed at the Royalty in 1879 ( with Miss</l>
     <l n="22">Nelly Bromley as the heroine ) , was re-written for revival , and finally</l>
     <l n="23">taken as the foundation of a third production in 1880 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In “ The Deep , Deep Sea , ” brought out in 1833 , Planche selected as the basis of his work the story of Perseus and Andromeda . He treated it with his usual reverence for the original legend . He represented Juno and the Nereids as being angry with King Cepheus , and sending the sea-serpent to devastate his shores . James Vining played the Serpent , and his approach was announced to the monarch in the following strain :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Mighty monarch , stir your stumps as if Old Nick were following :</l>
     <l n="2">A serpent with an awful twist has landed on your shore ;</l>
     <l n="3">Our gallant soldiers , guns and all , by regiments he 's swallowing ;</l>
     <l n="4">And munching up musicians and composers by the score !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Of counsel learned in the law but brief work he is making —</l>
     <l n="6">Apothecaries just as they were pills , sir , he is taking ;</l>
     <l n="7">He snaps the parson right in two , as well as his oration ;</l>
     <l n="8">And ere the beadle bolts the door , he bolts the congregation !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Mighty monarch , stir your stumps , for court and caravansary</l>
     <l n="10">Are emptied of inhabitants all crazy with affright ;</l>
     <l n="11">The monster he is longer far than any suit in Chancery ,</l>
     <l n="12">And beats the Court of Aldermen , by chalks , for appetite !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The Serpent , when he arrives , introduces himself to the king in an</l>
     <l n="14">engaging fashion :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="15">All bones but yours will rattle when I say</l>
     <l n="16">I am the sea serpent from America .</l>
     <l n="17">Mayhap you 've heard that I 've been round the world ;</l>
     <l n="18">I guess I 'm round it now , mister , twice curled ....</l>
     <l n="19">Of all the monsters through the deep that splash ,</l>
     <l n="20">I 'm “ number one ” to all immortal smash .</l>
     <l n="21">When I lie down , and would my length unroll ,</l>

     <l n="24">I must be measured soon for a new ocean .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The exaggeration which is so characteristic of American humour is here happily satirised . In another passage , Perseus , addressing himself to Andromeda , sings a neatly turned parody of “ We met — ‘ twas in a Crowd ":—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We met ! ‘ twas at the ball ,</l>

     <l n="7">Ah , ne'er “ cavalier seul ”</l>
     <l n="8">Felt more wretched and lonely .</l>
     <l n="9">For when I squeezed your hand ,</l>
     <l n="10">As we turned one another ,</l>
     <l n="11">You frown 'd and said , “ Have done !</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">They called the Spanish dance ,</l>
     <l n="14">And we flew through it fleetly —</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Twas o'er — I could not breathe ,</l>
     <l n="16">For you 'd blown me completely .</l>
     <l n="17">I led you to a seat</l>
     <l n="18">Far away from the dancers ;</l>
     <l n="19">Quadrilles again began ,</l>
     <l n="20">They were playing “ the Lancers ” ;</l>
     <l n="21">Again I squeezed your hand ,</l>
     <l n="22">And my anguish to smother</l>
     <l n="23">You smiled , and said , “ Dear Sir ,</l>
     <l n="24">You may speak to my mother . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In 1861 Perseus and Andromeda reappeared upon the comic stage at the instance of William Brough , who made them the hero and heroine of a burlesque at the St. James 's .</p>
   <p>The story of Telemachus was the subject which engaged the attention of Planche immediately after he had done with Perseus . Fenelon 's tale had become extremely familiar to the British schoolboy , who at that time was not thought to have “ grounded ” himself sufficiently in French until he had read the narrative in the original . Hence Planche 's “ Telemachus , or the Island of Calypso ,"[ 10 ] concerning which the author took credit to himself once more for having “ preserved the well-known plot with the most reverential fidelity . ” Ten years later the same subject was treated in the “ Telemachus ” of Stirling Coyne , played at the Adelphi with Miss Woolgar in the title-part , Wright as Calypso ( a ballet-dancer ! ) and Paul Bedford as the hero 's Mentor or “ tor-Mentor . ” In 1863 the story of the parents of Telemachus proved attractive to Mr. Burnand , whose “ Patient Penelope ” made her curtsey at the Strand , to be followed at the St. James 's , two years later , by the same writer 's “ Ulysses . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>Played at the Olympic in 1834 .</p>
   <p>Still tracing the course of Planche 's labours in burlesque , we come next to the production , at the Haymarket in 1845 , of “ The Golden Fleece ” — perhaps , on the whole , the most delightful of the series . In this ingenious and brilliant piece , the two parts of which were entitled respectively “ Jason in Colchis ” and “ Medea in Corinth , ” Planche had taken the narrative of Apollonius Rhodius and the tragedy of Euripides , and had built upon them a composition in which he sought less to cast ridicule upon the legends selected than to travestie what he called “ the modus operandi of the classical period , which really illustrates the old proverbial observation that there is but one step from the sublime to the ridiculous . ” He brought again upon the stage the ancient Chorus , incarnated in a single person , who explained the action of the piece as it went on , not hesitating even to interrupt it when the humorous opportunity occurred . Charles Mathews undertook the part , heralded by a jocose announcement on the “ bills ” to the effect that “ The lessee has , regardless of expense , engaged Mr. Charles Mathews to represent the whole body of the chorus , rendering at least fifty-nine male voices entirely unnecessary . ” In the opening scene , the Chorus thus described his functions :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Friends , countrymen , lovers , first listen to me :</l>
     <l n="2">I 'm the Chorus ; whatever you hear or you see</l>
     <l n="3">That you do n't understand , I shall rise to explain —</l>
     <l n="4">It 's a famous old fashion that 's come up again ,</l>
     <l n="5">And will be of great service to many fine plays</l>
     <l n="6">That nobody can understand nowadays ;</l>
     <l n="7">And think what a blessing if found intervening ,</l>
     <l n="8">When the author himself scarcely knows his own meaning .</l>
     <l n="9">You may reap from it , too , an advantage still further :</l>
     <l n="10">When an actor is bent upon marriage or murther ,</l>
     <l n="11">To the Chorus his scheme he in confidence mentions ,</l>
     <l n="12">‘ Stead of telling the pit all his secret intentions ;</l>
     <l n="13">A wondrous improvement you all will admit ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the secret is just as well heard by the pit .</l>
     <l n="15">Verbum sat .— To the wise I 'll not put one more word in ,</l>
     <l n="16">Or instead of a Chorus , they 'll think me a burden .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">Later in the piece , announcing the approach of King AEetes ( Bland ) , the</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">AEetes comes , looking as black as thunder ,</l>

     <l n="22">Has done the trick , and done the King as well .</l>
     <l n="23">You 'll think , perhaps , you should have seen him do it ,</l>

   <p>“ Medea , ” it will be remembered , was the title and subject of a burlesque by Robert Brough , brought out at the Olympic in 1856 , with Robson in the title-part , Emery as Creon ( King of Corinth ) , and Julia St. George as Jason . Medea ( “ the best of mothers , with a brute of a husband , ” as the sub-title has it ) was one of Robson 's most impressive roles , being charged at more than one point ( notably in the closing scene , which was played by all the characters in serious fashion ) with real tragic intensity . In the lighter vein were such episodes as the duet with Jason ( to the air of “ Robinson Crusoe ” ) , which I quote as illustrative of the neatness and humour with which Brough constructed such trifles :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="6">Is “ he 's going to marry Creusa . ”</l>

   <p>The last of Planche 's classical burlesques was produced at the Lyceum in 1848 . It was on the subject of “ Theseus and Ariadne , ” and was fortunate in the services of Charles Mathews as Daedalus . In this character Mathews sang a song which Planche had written for private performance and had brought “ down to date ” for the occasion . It is one of the happiest melanges ever put together , beginning —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I 'm still in a flutter — I scarcely can utter</l>
     <l n="2">The words to my tongue that come dancing — come dancing ;</l>
     <l n="3">I 've had such a dream that I 'm sure it must seem</l>
     <l n="4">To incredulous ears like romancing — romancing .</l>
     <l n="5">No doubt it was brought on by that Madame Wharton ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who muddled me quite with her models — her models ;</l>
     <l n="7">Or Madame Tussaud , who in waxwork can show</l>
     <l n="8">Of all possible people the noddles — the noddles .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The only song , of the kind , worthy to compare with this , is the description of the Heavy Dragoon sung by Colonel Calverly in the “ Patience ” of Mr. Gilbert , who , as a master of light badinage and intricate rhythm and rhyme , is the lineal descendant of the author of “ Theseus and Ariadne . ”</p>
   <p>After Planche , the most notable of the deceased writers of “ classical ” burlesque is undoubtedly Francis Talfourd . Planche 's knowledge of the Greek mythology and drama was admittedly derived from translations and from dictionaries ; Talfourd was a university man , and had an at-first-hand acquaintance with the masterpieces which he so skilfully travestied . The marks of this are visible in all his “ classical ” pieces , and notably in the first of them — “ Alcestis , the Original Strong-minded Woman , being a most Shameless Misinterpretation of the Greek drama of Euripides . ” This was played at the Strand in 1850 . The “ argument ” prefixed to it is an excellent bit of punning :—</p>
   <p>Admetus , being due to Death , and as such totally unprepared to take himself up , is about to betake himself down , according to previous arrangement , when Orcus , who had meanwhile been trying his mean wiles on Alcestis ( Admetus ’ very much better half ) , expresses himself willing to receive her as a substitute ; her husband , friends , and relations not feeling quite so disposed to be disposed of . Alcestis , however , consents , packs up her traps , and then obligingly goes packing down those of Orcus . At this melancholy juncture , Hercules chances to be passing through Thessaly , on his return from his provincial engagements , and , having a knack of turning up a trump at a rub , plays his club so judiciously as to retake the queen , in spite of the deuce , and restores her to her family and friends .</p>
   <p>In the dialogue of “ Alcestis ” we have such quips as these :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">E'en like a detonator down he goes</l>
     <l n="2">To pay the debt o ’ natur which he owes .</l>

     <l n="7">I 'd no time to aggravate Mamma ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="9">In one place Alcestis , apropos of the marriage which is being forced</l>
     <l n="10">upon her , cries bitterly :—</l>

   <p>In 1851 came “ Thetis and Peleus , ” in which Talfourd had a collaborator . In 1857 he produced , at the Haymarket , “ Atalanta , or the Three Golden Apples , ” inserting in the “ bill ” a comic note to the effect that “ Lest he should be accused of murdering a good subject , the Author begs to state that it was FOUN ’ DED from unknown causes many years ago . ” Miss Oliver was the Atalanta , and Miss Wilton the Cupid . Among the other characters is Mississarris , Atalanta 's duenna , “ the Guard of the Old Greek Stage , with , in this instance , an eye to the Males , subsequently attached to the old Coach , Paidagogos , ” played by Compton . One of the cleverest scenes in the piece is designed and written in parody of the balcony scene in “ Romeo and Juliet . ” Hippomenes , the hero , is seen climbing “ over the garden wall , ” guitar in hand . Descending , he soliloquises :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He jests at scars who ne'er in climbing hit upon</l>
     <l n="2">A place with spikes and broken glass to sit upon .</l>
     <l n="3">But soft , a light !— where lights are there 's a liver .</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Tis she ! I 'll try a gentle hint to give her</l>
     <l n="5">Upon my mandoline , though I 'm afraid</l>
     <l n="6">I 'm somewhat too hoarse for a serenade .</l>
     <l n="7">This night air is too musical by far ,</l>
     <l n="8">And on my chest has struck a light catarrh ....</l>
     <l n="9">Ah , see ! The window opens — it is she ,</l>
     <l n="10">More fair than ever in her robe de nuit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">( Atalanta appears on balcony above . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">She speaks — yet nothing says ! She 's not to blame ,</l>
     <l n="13">Members of Parliament do much the same .</l>
     <l n="14">Her mouth rests on her hand — I 'm not above</l>
     <l n="15">Wishing I were upon that hand a glove .</l>
     <l n="16">Gladly the storms of Poverty I 'd weather ,</l>
     <l n="17">So we might live from hand to mouth together !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Elsewhere Hippomenes delivers himself of a superexcellent pun . Some one says to him , referring to his studies ,— “ But think of your degree ” ; to which he replies :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I do — and see</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Tis a degree too far-in-height for me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>After “ Atalanta "[ 11 ] came Talfourd 's “ Pluto and Proserpine , or the Belle and the Pomegranate , ” played at the Haymarket in 1858 , and his “ Electra in an Electric Light , ” performed at the Haymarket the year following . In “ Pluto and Proserpine , ” as in his other pieces , the original myth is followed closely . One passage supplies a happy parody of the famous “ palace-lifting-to-eternal-summer ” speech in “ The Lady of Lyons . ” Pluto has appeared to Proserpine as a young man , and has laid siege to her heart in proper form . He is careful not to disclose his identity . At last Proserpine says :—</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Of recent years Atalanta has been made the heroine of a burlesque by Mr. G. P. Hawtrey . Of this I give some account in my final chapter on “ The New Burlesque . ”</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But Talfourd , like Planche , could rise above mere jeux d'esprit , and furnish , when necessary , bits of persiflage which deserve to linger in the memory . Thus , in one of the scenes , Pluto addresses Cerberus in a fashion intended to suggest Launce 's colloquy with his dog in “ The Two Gentlemen of Verona ":—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">You 've yet to learn the notions of propriety ,</l>

   <p>I have already referred to three classical burlesques by H. J. Byron . A fourth exists in the “ original classical pastoral ” called “ Pan , ” which first saw the light at the Adelphi in 1865 . Pan , it may be recorded , was impersonated by Mr. J. L. Toole . He had a good deal to say , and much of it was in the form of jeux de mots . Take , for example , the passage in which Pan discovers that Syrinx , whom he loves , is in love with Narcissus . He calls down thunder from the skies ; and then follows this tirade :—</p>
   <p>Narcissus . What means this sudden dreadful change , I wonder ?</p>
   <p>Pan . It means , great Pan is outraged !</p>
   <p>Omnes . Pan !</p>
   <p>Pan . Ah , Pan !</p>

     <l n="1">Beware his hate and jealousy , young man .</l>
     <l n="2">Blight shall o'erwhelm ye ! See , your native corn</l>
     <l n="3">Turns into ashes with my withering scorn .</l>
     <l n="4">Your wheat shall shrink and shrivel , every sheaf ;</l>
     <l n="5">Your cattle swell the cattlelogue of grief ;</l>
     <l n="6">With murrain all your sheep rot in their pens ,</l>

   <p>This is a very fair specimen of Byron 's rather careless method ; and another is at hand in the following lines , which are spoken after the Carian captain has shown to Pan a jar of wine :—</p>

   <p>To the burlesques by William Brough already mentioned may be added “ Endymion , or the Naughty Boy who cried for the Moon ” ( St. James 's , 1860 ) , and “ Pygmalion , or the Statue Fair ” ( Strand , 1867 ) . The former ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>of course , has to do with the fabled fondness of Diana for Endymion , and vice versa .

   <p>In “ Pygmalion "[ 13 ] we are asked to suppose that Venus is indignant with the sculptor for his lack of susceptibility to female charms . Cupid therefore undertakes to punish him by making him fall in love with his new statue , Galatea . To this statue Venus , at Pygmalion 's request , gives life ; but she withholds the power of loving . Galatea , therefore , is for ever slighting the sculptor 's affection . Here is the opening of their first interview , which the curious may compare with the similar situation in Mr. Gilbert 's “ Pygmalion and Galatea : ” —</p>

   <p>Two mythological burlesques stand to the credit of Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett — “ The Son of the Sun , or the Fate of Phaeton , ” played at the Fitzroy Theatre so long ago as 1834 ; and “ The Three Graces , ” a two-act piece , seen at the Princess 's in 1843 , with Oxberry , Wright , and Paul Bedford in the cast . Both of these travesties are very smoothly and gracefully written , with fewer puns than the author afterwards permitted himself . “ The Three Graces , ” moreover , is not very prolific in contemporary allusion ; though here and there , as in the following passage , between the heroines — Aglaia , Thalia , and Euphrosyne — there is some gentle satire :—</p>

   <p>Mr. Burnand has written more “ classical ” burlesques than any man living or dead . A university man , like Talfourd , he has displayed complete mastery of mythologic themes , submitting them to ingenious perversion , and adorning them with a wealth of pun and parody of which it is impossible , in these brief limits , to give more than a few samples . He has shown special interest in the legends connected with the siege of Troy ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>producing three burlesques more or less connected with that event . First , in 1860 , came “ Dido , ” at the St. James 's , with Charles Young as the heroine ; next , in 1866 , “ Paris , or Vive Lempriere , ” at the Strand ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>next , in 1867 , “ The Latest Edition of Helen , or Taken from the Greek , ” at Liverpool .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>Helen of Troy , I may note , en parenthese , had been the heroine of two other travesties : one by Vincent Amcotts — “ Fair Helen ” ( Oxford , 1862 ) ; the other by Mr. Robert Reece — “ Our Helen ” ( Gaiety , 1884 ) .</p>

   <p>In 1863 Mr. Burnand brought out , at the Royalty , “ Ixion , or the Man at the Wheel ,"[ 17 ] which proved to be one of the happiest of his efforts . This he followed up , at the same theatre , two years later , with “ Pirithous , ” in which the adventures of Ixion 's son were as humorously depicted . In the interval he had produced at the Olympic “ Cupid and Psyche ” ( December , 1864 ) , a burlesque on an ever-popular subject . Years before — so early as 1837 — a piece called “ Cupid , ” written by Joseph Graves , had been represented at the Queen 's and Strand , with Wild and Miss Malcolm at the one house and Hammond and Miss Daly at the other as the God of Love and his beloved . In “ Cupid , ” however , there was little verbal wit . The god figured as a gay deceiver , who had promised marriage to Psyche , but had refused to “ implement ” the undertaking . Whereupon Jupiter decides that Cupid shall be shot dead by Psyche ; but she , using the god 's own arrows , does but transfix him with the love she yearns for . Cupid sings , early in the piece , a parody of “ The Sea ! the Sea ! ” beginning —</p>

   <p>In “ Cupid and Psyche ” Mr. Burnand made Psyche the daughter of a king , who , because she will not marry and thus relieve him of the anxiety caused by a certain Prophecy , chains her to a rock on the sea-shore . To this he is incited by Venus , who regards Psyche as her rival in beauty . Psyche is duly rescued and espoused by Cupid , who ( as in the old myth ) remains invisible to her until her curiosity gets the better of her prudence ; and , in the end , Venus abates her enmity , and the union of the pair is duly recognised . In one place , Psyche , entering , distractedly , in search of Cupid , cries :—</p>

    <head>BURLESQUE OF FAERIE .</head>
    <head>As Planche was , in effect , the Father of Classical Burlesque , so was he also , even more irrefragably , the Father of the Burlesque of Faerie — of the fairy tales of the nursery , and especially of those derived from French sources . Memorable , indeed , was the production of Planche 's “ Riquet with the Tuft<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>” ; this piece was the precursor of something like twenty others from the same pen , all written on the same principle and in the same vein . Planche had been to Paris , and had there seen Potier playing in “ Riquet a la Houppe . ” He came home and straightway wrote his own version of the story , partly in verse , partly in prose , having in Charles Mathews a Riquet not equal indeed to Potier , but with obvious merits of his own . Vestris was the Princess Emeralda , and James Bland Green Horn the Great — Rebecca Isaacs , then only a little girl , being the Mother Bunch . The result was complete success , carrying with it great encouragement to the dramatist to persevere in the new path on which he had entered .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>These fairy pieces of Planche 's were not burlesques quite in the sense in which his classical pieces were , but they belong , nevertheless , to the burlesque genre . Each treats lightly and humorously a story already in existence ; each includes parodies of popular lyrics , as well as songs written to the airs of popular ditties ; and the burlesque spirit animates the whole . Every now and then , the writer , rising superior to parody , produces a lyric which has a definite accent of its own . Here , for example , in “ Riquet with the Tuft , ” is a song accorded to the grotesque and misshapen hero . It has genuine wit as well as genial philosophy :—</p>

     <l n="25">The origin of “ Riquet with the Tuft ” is to be found in Perrault 's</l>
     <l n="26">“ Contes de ma Mere l'Oye . ” Planche went to the same source for his</l>
     <l n="27">“ Puss in Boots : an original , comical , mews-ical fairy burletta ”</l>
     <l n="28">( Olympic , 1837 ) , in which Charles Mathews was an incomparable Puss ,</l>
     <l n="29">with Bland as Pumpkin the Prodigious , Vestris as the Marquis of</l>
     <l n="30">Carabas , and Brougham as a very Irish ogre . In this there was a good</l>
     <l n="31">deal of prose dialogue , of which the following scene between Puss and</l>
     <l n="32">the three maids-of-honour may be taken as a diverting specimen :—</l>

     <l n="38">Mme . Vestris ; the inevitable King — Thomas Noddy of No-Land — was</l>
     <l n="39">the inevitable Bland ; James Vining was Prince Perfect ; and</l>
     <l n="40">Brougham was a woodcutter — one Larry O'Log . But the most whimsical</l>
     <l n="41">character in the piece was played by Harley — the Baron Factotum ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ Great-Grand-Lord-Everything , ” who may be compared with Pooh-Bah in Mr .</l>

     <l n="72">The programme of the “ The Sleeping Beauty ” bore the following notice :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In strict accordance with the Modern School of Melodramatic Composition , Eighteen years are to be supposed to have elapsed between the First and Second Parts ; One Hundred years between the Second and Third Parts ; and considerably more than One Hundred after the piece is over .</p>
   <p>Planche went again to Perrault — directly or indirectly — for his “ Blue Beard ” ( 1839 ) and his “ Discreet Princess ” ( 1855 ) . The last named ( from “ L'Adroite Princesse ” ) was notable as including in its cast Robson as Prince Richcraft , and Emery as Gander the Stupendous . In “ Blue Beard ” Bland played the Baron Abomelique ( the hero ) , Mme . Vestris the heroine ( Fleurette ) , and John Brougham , the actor-dramatist , an Irish character — the O'Shac O'Back . How often has this fascinating subject been dealt with since ! Dozens of pantomimes have had it for a basis ; the burlesques founded on it are not quite so numerous . The best known are those by H. J. Byron ( 1860 ) and Mr. Burnand ( 1883 ) ; there are also two others by H. T. Arden and Frank Green .</p>
   <p>But it was to the “ Contes des Fees ” of Madame D'Aulnoy that Planche was most largely indebted for his fairy stories . The list ( extending from 1842 to 1854 ) is quite an imposing one . First came “ Fortunio , and his Seven Gifted Servants , ” based on “ Belle-Belle , ou le Chevalier Fortune . ” Next , “ The Invisible Prince , or the Island of Tranquil Delights , ” taken from “ Le Prince Lutin . ” “ Le Rameau d'Or ” suggested “ The Golden Branch , ” and “ The King of Peacocks "[ 20 ] had its origin in “ La Princesse Rosette . ” From “ Le Serpentin Vert ” was derived “ The Island of Jewels ” ; from “ L'Oiseau Bleu , ” “ King Charming , or the Blue Bird of Paradise ” ; from “ La Grenouille Bienfaisante , ” “ The Queen of the Frogs ” ; from “ La Biche au Bois ,"[ 21 ] “ The Prince of Happy Land , or the Fawn in the Forest ” ; from “ La Princesse Carpillon , ” “ Once upon a Time there were Two Kings ” ; and from “ Le Nain Jeune , ” “ The Yellow Dwarf and the King of the Gold Mines . ” “ Beauty and the Beast ” was taken from a tale by Mme . le Prince de Beaumont ; but Planche claimed that the treatment was wholly new . He had Vestris for his Beauty , Harrison the tenor for his Beast , and Bland for his Sir Aldgate Pump , the father of Beauty . “ The Good Woman in the Wood ” was from a story by Mme . de la Force ; and “ Young and Handsome ” from a faerie by the Countess de Murat . “ Graciosa and Percinet ” likewise had a French origin .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>This , first played at the Lyceum in 1860 , was afterwards revived at the St. James 's with Miss Kate Terry as the Princess .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>Other versions of this tale have been written by Maddison Morton ( at Drury Lane ) , and by Mr. Burnand ( at the Holborn in 1868 , under the title of “ The White Fawn ” ) .</p>
   <p>It was , however , in each case only for the fable that Planche had to give thanks : everything else — even in most instances the nomenclature — was his own . And that nomenclature was often very ingenious and amusing . Thus , in “ Fortunio , ” we have an impecunious noble called Baron Dunover ( played by Morris Barnett ) . In “ The Invisible Prince ” the name of the Queen of Allaquiz is Blouzabella ; her son is the Infante Furibond ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>and among her courtiers are the Marquis of Anysidos , Count Palava Torquemova ( who introduces the ambassadors ) , and Don Moustachez de Haro y Barbos ( Captain of the Guard ) . In the same piece , the Princess of the Island of Tranquil Delights is called Xquisitelittlepet , and her ladies in waiting are Toxaloto-tittletattle and Itsaprettipetticoat . Soyez Tranquille ( with a clever suggestion of Soyer ) is the chef de cuisine in “ The King of the Peacocks , ” in which there is also an Irishman , The O'Don ' t Know Who , and a German , the Baroness Von Huggermugger . Planche 's kings and queens have mostly comic names . There is Giltgingerbread the Great , with Tinsellina , his consort , in “ The Island of Jewels . ” There is Henpeckt the Hundredth in “ King Charming ” ; there is Fulminoso the Pugnacious in “ The Queen of the Frogs ” ; there is Periwigulus the Proud in “ Once upon a Time there were Two Kings . ” Henpeckt , again , has a valet called Natty , and a porter called Nobby . Elsewhere we come across an usher named Antirumo , an Indian named Tan-tee-vee ( of the tribe of Tal-hee-ho ) , and an evil genius named Abaddun . The Yellow Dwarf is christened , very appropriately , Gambogie .<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>This part , originally played ( in 1846 ) by James Bland , was played by Mr. Toole at the Adelphi in 1859 , and afterwards by George Honey at the Princess 's .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>The part of the Yellow Dwarf was first played ( Olympic , 1854 ) by Robson , of whose performance Planche says that “ So powerful was his personation of the cunning , the malignity , the passion and despair of the monster , that he elevated extravaganza into tragedy . ” At one point his delivery of the lines moved Thackeray almost to tears . “ It is not a burlesque , ” he exclaimed : “ it is an idyll . ”</p>
   <p>“ The Yellow Dwarf , ” it may here be chronicled , is the title of a burlesque by Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett and by Mr. Robert Reece ; A'Beckett ' s being produced in 1842 , Planche 's in 1854 , and Mr. Reece 's in 1882 . “ Beauty and the Beast ” has been made the subject of travestie by Mr. Burnand . The “ Fortunio ” of Planche was also rivalled in the “ Lady Belle Belle , or Fortunio and his Seven Magic Men ” of H. J. Byron ( Adelphi , 1863 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>This last was in a thoroughly H. J. Byronic vein , with a Count Collywobbol among its characters and the usual supply of puns and parodies . Here are a few of the best of the puns .

   <p>From Planche 's “ Seven Champions of Christendom ” to the “ St. George and the Dragon ” of Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett ( 1845 ) and the “ Sir George and a Dragon , or We are Seven ” of Mr. Burnand ( 1856 ) is a natural and easy transition . In A'Beckett ' s piece , Kalyba , the sorceress , has stolen St. George when a child , in order that he might fall in love with her , and so rescue her from prophesied destruction . Getting rid of her with a wave of her own wand , he turns up with his fellow Champions at Memphis , where King Ptolemy is in a state of impecuniosity , the Dragon having swallowed up all his resources . The monster demands the King 's daughter Sabra , but St. George contrives to trick him out of the legal securities he holds , and eventually destroys him by the power of the steam press . There is a vein of allegory running through the piece , which has , however , its share of jeux de mots . Thus , Kalyba 's handmaid says to her :—</p>

   <p>In Mr. Burnand 's version , which is the longer of the two , there is much more story , and there are many more puns . St. George has not so prominent a place in the action , which is more elaborate and varied ; while the dialogue is in the writer 's most rollicking mood .

   <p>A popular subject with the writers of burlesque for Christmastide has been the time-honoured one of Cinderella . The first travestie of any importance was by Albert Smith and Kenny , seen at the Lyceum so long ago as 1845 . Next came H. J. Byron 's version at the Strand in 1860 , followed by Mr. Green 's in 1871 , Mr. Wilton Jones 's ( at Leicester ) in 1878 , and Mr. Reece 's ( at the Gaiety ) in 1883 . A provincial burlesque on this topic was called “ Done-to-a-Cinderella , ” and in America there has been a “ Cinder-Ellen . ” Mr. Reece 's piece was called , simply , “ Our Cinderella ” ; Mr. Jones 's , “ Little Cinderella . ” Byron 's was christened “ Cinderella , or the Lover , the Lackey , and the Little Glass Slipper . ” It has been a great favourite with the public ever since it was first played with Maria Simpson as Cinderella , Miss Oliver as the Prince ( Popetti ) , Miss Charlotte Saunders as his valet Dandino , John Clarke as the Baron Balderdash , and Rogers and Miss Lavine as Clorinda and Thisbe . Over and over again has this clever piece of work served as the basis of pantomime “ openings ” both in town and country .</p>
   <p>Following the traditional story closely enough , it bristles with the puns in which Byron revelled , and which he poured forth with singular and somewhat exhausting lavishness . Thus , we find Dandino saying :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">As I 've made my bed so I must lie .</l>
     <l n="2">Continuing bed metaphor , sir — I ,</l>
     <l n="3">When quite a child , the blackest draught would drain ,</l>
     <l n="4">And took my pill — oh ! on account o ’ pain !</l>
     <l n="5">And as my youthful feathers all unfurled</l>
     <l n="6">Seemed formed to make a bold stir in the world ,</l>
     <l n="7">Little dreamt I I should appear a valet as ,</l>
     <l n="8">For I seemed born to reign in royal palliasse ;</l>
     <l n="9">But suddenly the future seemed to frown ;</l>
     <l n="10">Fortune gave me a quilt , an ’ I 'd a down .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A little farther on Dandino and the Prince , who are about to exchange characters for the nonce , have the following little contest in pun-making :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dandi . But I must have a change of toggery :</l>
     <l n="2">This coat , you will admit , is not the best cut ,</l>
     <l n="3">And neither is my waistcoat quite the West cut .</l>
     <l n="4">I must divest myself of that affair :</l>
     <l n="5">These buckles ai n't the thing for Buckley Square .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Prince . You shall be decked in gems of vast expense ,</l>
     <l n="7">And be a gem-man in a double sense .</l>
     <l n="8">Your servant , I will wait , clean boots , wash glasses ;</l>
     <l n="9">Thus serve a nob , an ’ ob-serve all that passes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Dandi . Then you 'll obey me till you 've found La Donna ?</l>
     <l n="11">You pledge your princely word ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">Prince ( shaking his hand heartily ) . A-pawn my honour .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>An even better instance of Byron 's tendency to run a pun to death is to be found in this colloquy between the Prince and Cinderella . The latter says :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Cind . Cinders and coals I 'm so accustomed to ,</l>
     <l n="2">They seem to me to tinge all things I view .</l>

   <p>More acceptible in , pantomime than in travestie , “ Little Red Riding Hood ” has nevertheless been the heroine of at least one burlesque which has made its mark — namely , that which Leicester Buckingham brought out at the Lyceum just thirty years ago , under the auspices of Edmund Falconer . He had Miss Lydia Thompson for his Blondinette ( Red Riding Hood ) , and Miss Cicely Nott for the young lady 's lover , Colin . The fairy element was freely introduced , and instead of the wolf of the original there was a Baron Reginald de Wolf ( “ the would-be abductor of Blondinette , who finds he is sold when she ‘ ab duck 'd herself to escape him ” ) . Here and there one gets in the “ book ” a glimpse of parody ; as in —</p>

   <p>Passing over “ Jack the Giant Killer , ” which H. J. Byron made the subject of a burlesque , and “ Jack and the Beanstalk , ” which was treated in the same vein by the late Charles Millward , we come to the travesties suggested by stories in the “ Arabian Nights ’ Entertainments . ” These are fairly numerous . We may note , in particular , some of the versions of the tales of Aladdin , Ali Baba , Prince Camaralzaman , and Abon Hassan , which seem to have offered most attractions to our comic writers .</p>
   <p>The first “ Aladdin ” of importance was that given to the world by Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett in 1844 . This was entitled “ The Wonderful Lamp in a New Light , ” and had Wright for its Aladdin and Paul Bedford for its Magician . Next in order of time comes H. J. Byron 's “ Aladdin , or the Wonderful Scamp ,"[ 26 ] which has shared the fate of his “ Cinderella ” as a basis for pantomimes . In this his fondness for jeux de mots is as patent as ever , as well as the ease ( without conspicuous finish ) with which he fitted words to the songs of the day . Of direct parody there is little in this “ Aladdin , ” which , however , opens with a brief suggestion of “ The sea , the sea , ” sung by the Vizier :—</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>During the last twenty years there have been four other notable burlesques on the “ Aladdin ” subject — Mr. Alfred Thompson 's ( 1870 ) , Mr. Green 's ( 1874 ) , Mr. Reece 's ( 1881 ) , and Mr. Geoffrey Thorn 's ( 1890 ) . With Mr. Reece 's are associated pleasant memories of the bright “ street boy ” of Miss Farren , Mr. Edward Terry 's whimsical magician , and the grace and refinement of Miss Kate Vaughan 's Badroulbadour .</p>

     <l n="1">Second only to “ Aladdin ” in acceptability both to authors and to</l>

     <l n="3">A'Beckett is ( with Mark Lemon ) to the fore with the travestie called</l>
     <l n="4">“ Open Sesame , or a Night with the Forty Thieves . ” This was produced at</l>
     <l n="5">the Lyceum Theatre , and had Mr. Frank Matthews for its Ali Baba , Mrs .</l>
     <l n="6">Alfred Wigan for its Ganem , Wigan himself for its O'Mustapha ( he was</l>
     <l n="7">an Irish Mussulman ) , the beautiful Miss Fairbrother for its Abdallah ,</l>

     <l n="9">Keeley for its Morgiana . There was a cast for you ! How many burlesque</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">Elsewhere , O'Mustapha , who was a shoemaker , had to say :—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">

     <l n="16">Where I sold fifty boots , I do n't mend one .</l>

     <l n="18">High-lows alone are worn by high and low .</l>
     <l n="19">In vain upon my door this bill I fix —</l>
     <l n="20">“ Five thousand Bluchers , all at 8s . 6d .,</l>
     <l n="21">Strong boys ’ at 3s . 9d . ” — folks once would use ,</l>
     <l n="22">But now it 's quite another pair of shoes .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A'Beckett , however , did not lay himself out for punning in and out of season . His chief merit is the neatness of his style and the pervading nature of his wit .</p>
   <p>The most famous of all the Ali Baba travesties was that “ joint-stock ” burlesque , “ The Forty Thieves , ” written by members of the Savage Club , and performed by the authors themselves at the Lyceum , in 1860 , for the benefit of the families of two literary men just then deceased . Planche wrote the prologue for this piece , and it was at once so brilliant and so admirably delivered by Leicester Buckingham that it nearly obtained the extraordinary honour of an encore . It was followed , three years later , by H. J. Byron 's “ Ali Baba , or the Thirty-Nine Thieves ( in accordance with the author 's habit of taking one off ! ) . "[ 27 ] Abdallah , the captain of the thieves ( played by Miss Ada Swanborough ) , was here depicted as a rascal of the quiet , elegant order , in sharp contrast to the Surrey-side villainy of his lieutenant , Hassarac . A colloquy between these gave Byron an opportunity of satirising the melodramatic criminal of the “ good old times ":—</p>

   <p>Two of the burlesques on “ Arabian Nights ” topics are from the pen of Francis Talfourd . First came — in 1852 , at the Olympic — “ Ganem , the Slave of Love ” ( with Miss Fanny Maskell as Fetnah , the caliph 's favourite ) ; and later — in 1854 , at the St. James 's — “ Abon Hassan , or the Hunt after Happiness ” ( with Mr. Toole as Haroun-al-Raschid ) . In the former piece the wealth of felicitous punning is remarkable . Thus , in his very , first speech , Ganem , coming in intoxicated , says :—</p>

   <p>On German faerie our comic dramatists have not drawn at all largely . Such pieces as Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett ' s “ Knight and the Sprite , or the Cold-Water Cure , ” with Ondine as its heroine ; H. J. Byron 's “ Nymph of the Lurleyburg , or the Knight and the Naiads , ” based on the Lurline legend ; and Mr. Burnand 's “ Rumpelstiltskin , or the Woman at the Wheel , ” founded on one of the Brothers Grimm 's narratives , are exceptional incursions in this field . The first was seen at the Strand in 1884 , with Mrs. Walter Lacy as Sir Hildebrand , and with Hall and Romer in other parts . “ The Nymph of the Lurleyburg ” has often done duty for the purposes of Christmas extravaganza . When it was first performed — in 1859 — Miss Woolgar was the Sir Rupert the Reckless , Mr. Toole the Seneschal , and Paul Bedford the Baron Witz , the locale being the Adelphi . Mr. Burnand introduced into “ Rumpelstiltskin ” ( Royalty , 1864 ) a few modifications of the German tale , inventing and importing new characters . In one of the scenes he furnished a diverting suggestion of the situation in “ The Ticket of Leave Man , ” when there comes the sudden and effective revelation of “ Hawkshaw the Detective ! ” Among the personae are King Tagarag the Tremendous , Prince Poppet , Baron Higgle-de-Piggle , Wriggleletto ( the court spy ) , Jolinosio ( a miller ) , and Fraulein Splitaharter ( the belle of the village ) . Miss Ada Cavendish was the Princess Superba .</p>
   <p>“ The Vampire ” — a burlesque by Mr. Reece , which was played at the Strand in 1872 — appears to have owed its origin about equally to the German legend , the romance which Lord Byron wrote on the subject , and the play which Dion Boucicault founded on the topic in 1852 . As , however , the legend was the inspiration alike of romance , play , and travestie , the travestie may be mentioned here . Mr. Reece had drawn the Vampire as a being so fond of “ blood , ” that he sought to possess it in the shape of the notebooks of two “ sensation ” - novelists , one of whom , Lady Audley Moonstone , was admirably represented by Mrs. Raymond .<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>The following specimen of the dialogue has been handed down to us .

   </lg>
   <p>In the realm of Spanish legend there have been still fewer explorers . Albert Smith took one of Washington Irving 's tales of the Alhambra , and fashioned it into “ The Alhambra , or The Beautiful Princess , ” played at the Princess 's in 1851 , with the Keeleys , Wigan , Harley , Flexmore , and Miss Vivash . H. J. Byron afterwards went to the same source for “ The Pilgrim of Love , ” in the first cast of which — at the Haymarket in 1860 — we find the names of Mrs. Buckingham White as the Pilgrim , Chippendale as his tutor , Compton as the King of Toledo , Rogers as the King of Granada , and C. Coghlan as Mafoi , a Frenchman : a rather notable collocation of distinguished players .</p>
   <p>The Fables of AEsop have inspired at least one travestie — “ Leo the Terrible , ” by Stirling Coyne and Francis Talfourd . In this piece ( brought out at the Haymarket in 1852 ) all the characters but four wore the heads of beasts or birds — a lion ( Bland ) , a wolf ( Buckstone ) , a fox , an owl , a ram , a poodle , a cat ( Miss Maskell ) , and so on . The four exceptions were Sir Norval de Battersea , Timoleon Sindbad Potts ( Keeley ) , AEsop , and Gay ; and the play opened with a rencontre between the two last-named worthies . AEsop began with a vocal parody on “ The Light of other Days ":—</p>

   <p>V .</p>
   <p>BURLESQUE OF HISTORY .</p>
   <p>In this department the artists in travestie have not done so much as might have been expected . Even when we include in the word “ history ” such things as myths , legends , and traditions , we find that the historical , in comparison with the other fields open to the parodists , has been quite “ second favourite . ” Particularly little has been achieved in the burlesque of foreign persons and events ; and , in the case of our own celebrities , the only really familiar figure on the comic stage has been that of “ Bluff King Hal . ” King Arthur , Alfred the Great , Elizabeth , Oliver Cromwell , have made rare appearances in motley . In the by-paths of history , general and local , the burlesque writers have devoted themselves most frequently to popular personages like Herne the Hunter , the Lady Godiva , Robin Hood , Dick Whittington , Guy Fawkes , Claude Duval , and Richard Turpin .</p>
   <p>The story of Rome has supplied subjects for two of the most notable burlesques of the past twenty years — the “ Romulus and Remus ” of Mr. Reece , and the “ Field Marshal Julius Cnaesar ” of Mr. Burnand . The former was played at the Vaudeville in 1872 , and had for its chief interpreters Messrs. James and Thorne , who had not yet wholly surrendered burlesque for comedy . Mr. James was Romulus , and Mr. Thorne was Remus ; and they came on in the first scene as children , dressed in pinafores and socks , and carrying toys . The pair begin by quarrelling as to which of them was born first . Remus rests his claim on his superior size :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Nature , perceiving “ true grit ” and “ no shoddy , ”</l>
     <l n="2">Made me thus “ double stout ” with “ extra body . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">To which Romulus replies :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">Though at our birth ( when both kicked up a shine )</l>
     <l n="5">His cry was stout , mine was the elder whine !</l>
     <l n="6">Hence this thin body , wise folks say who 've been here ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ We 're sure you are the elder , now we 've seen yer . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>When the two grow up ( as they do between the first scene and the second ) , the question is , which is to be King of Rome — a question decided eventually by personal combat , in which Remus falls . Ultimately the pair decide to be partners in the throne — an obvious allusion to the position held by the two actors in reference to the Vaudeville Theatre .</p>
   <p>The date of the production of “ Romulus and Remus ” ( 1872 ) could be fixed by the aid of a brief passage introduced in travestie of a scene between Cromwell and the King in Mr. Wills 's “ Charles I ., ” then “ running ” at the Lyceum . Early in the piece we have these lines :—</p>

   <p>In this piece Apollo ( Miss Nelly Power ) figures as a sort of Chorus , commenting on the action and interposing in it ; while Baccharia ( Miss Maria Rhodes ) is represented as the sister of Tatius and a husband-huntress . The burlesque has all Mr. Reece 's ingenuity in jeu-de-mot work . For instance :—</p>
   <p>Tatius . This is too much !</p>
   <p>Baccharia . To boast of deeds audacious .</p>
   <p>Tatius . Too callous !</p>
   <p>Romulus . Calais ! Do n't be Ostend-Tatius !</p>
   <p>Mr. Burnand 's “ Julius Cnaesar ” made the walls of the Royalty resound with laughter in the autumn of 1870 . In the spring of 1869 William Brough had brought out at the Strand his version of the tale of Joan of Arc , whom he represented as the leader of a troop of Amazons , extremely interested in Woman 's Rights . She comes , as in history , to the French king 's assistance ; but , falling in love with a young English soldier , is captured by the invaders and condemned to resume female attire ,— a sentence which in the end she manages to evade . A leading part is played by the Duke of Burgundy , who is for ever uncertain on which side he shall fight , and whose name provides frequent opportunity for punning . Thus :—</p>
   <p>Dunois . See , Burgundy comes !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">King . Is he indeed with me ?</l>

   <p>On this occasion Joan was impersonated by Mr. Thomas Thorne , Mr. David James being the Duke of Burgundy , Miss Eleanor Button the King , Miss Bella Goodall the Dunois , and Miss Amy Sheridan the Lionel . In the present year Joan of Arc has again become the subject of “ respectful perversion , ” — this time by Messrs. J. L. Shine and “ Adrian Ross , ” and after a fashion to which I shall draw attention in my final chapter .</p>
   <p>Of foreign notabilities , the only other subject of burlesque worth mentioning is Christopher Columbus , who gave the title to , and was the principal character in , a piece written by Mr. Alfred Thompson , and performed at the Gaiety two-and-thirty years ago . He was also the hero of a travestie by John Brougham , played in America .</p>
   <p>The first English personage in burlesque , in point of historical order , is the legendary King Arthur , who was the chief figure in an “ extravaganza ” produced at the Haymarket in 1863 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>Of this the author was William Brough , who owed considerably more to Malory than to Tennyson . There was a scene in which , as in the “ Idylls , ” Vivien makes Merlin the victim of his own spell ; but otherwise the laureate 's withers were unwrung . Arthur ( Miss Louise Keeley ) becomes King of Britain by virtue of his power to draw the magic sword from the stone in which it is embedded . He is looking forward to wed Guinevere ( Miss Wright ) , when suddenly she is captured by Cheldric , the Saxon invader , from whom , however , she is successfully re-captured by the aid of Vivien ( Miss Romer ) as the wielder of Merlin 's wand . Sir Launcelot ( Miss Lindley ) is exhibited less as the lover of Guinevere than as a warrior ; another prominent knight is the cowardly Sir Key , represented by Compton . Of direct parody , as I have said , the piece has little ; of punning , as usual , it is all compact . Vivien says to Merlin :—</p>

   <p>In Australia , twenty-three years ago , there was produced a burlesque called “ King Arthur , or Launcelot the Loose , Gin-ever the Square , and the Knights of the Round Table , and other Furniture ” ; the perpetrator 's name was W. M. Akhurst . Of recent years , the only prominent travestie of the subject has been that produced in 1889 , by Messrs. Richard Butler and Henry Chance Newton ( “ Richard-Henry ” ) , who entitled their work “ Launcelot the Lovely , or the Idol of the King . ” Here , again , Tennyson and Malory were both very loyally and lightly treated , and , though Mr. Arthur Roberts as Launcelot was eminently funny , the prepossessions of the audience were in no way shocked .</p>
   <p>The romantic tale of the loves of Fair Rosamond and His Majesty Henry II . has naturally attracted the notice of the travestie writers . In one instance , I regret to record , it fared very ill at the hands of the “ dramatist . ” One T. P. Taylor brought out at Sadler 's Wells in the ‘ thirties a one-act piece which he called “ Fair Rosamond according to the History of England , ” in which the story was at once modernised and degraded . Henry became a Mr. Henry King — “ a ruler , having been a stationer ” ; the Queen necessarily figured as “ Mrs. Ellinor King . ” Rosamond herself was transmogrified into “ a black girl , fair yet faulty , ” talking in “ darkey ” patois , and furnished with a father , black like herself , who combined the profession of fiddler and boot-black . The piece appears to have been successful in its day , but , to read , it is both vulgar and without a spark of wit .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Happily , the subject was taken up in our own time by Mr. Burnand , whose</l>
     <l n="2">“ Fair Rosamond , or the Maze , the Maid , and the Monarch , ” seen at the</l>
     <l n="3">Olympic in 1862 , is among the most vivacious of his productions .<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span></l>
     <l n="4">Here the writer boldly breaks away from historical tradition . He makes</l>
     <l n="5">Henry in love with Rosamond , it is true ; but Rosamond ( Miss Hughes ) , on</l>
     <l n="6">her side , has given her heart to Sir Pierre de Bonbon ( Horace Wigan ) — a</l>
     <l n="7">Frenchman , as his name betokens . As Rosamond sings in the finale :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8"><span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>Mr. Frederick Langbridge has printed a burlesque on this subject ,</l>
     <l n="9">with a title somewhat similar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Hist'ry says that Rosamond</l>

   <p>Rosamond , therefore , being innocent , it stands to reason that it would not be fair to poison her , as in the story ; and so the Queen ( played originally by Robson ) is made to excuse her clemency in not forcing the girl to accept the “ cup ” she offers her :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Why 's Rosamond not killed at all ? You see ,</l>
     <l n="2">She is n't poisoned as she ought to be !</l>
     <l n="3">Because , in deference to modern ways ,</l>
     <l n="4">No poisoned heroines can end our plays ;</l>
     <l n="5">Besides , the brimming cup she held this minute ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like the objection , friends , has nothing in it .</l>

   <p>Following the stream of time , we arrive next at a travestie of the insurrection , in the reign of Richard II ., in which Wat Tyler was the prime mover . Tyler deserves celebration in the history of burlesque as the hero of the only work of this kind produced by Mr. George Augustus Sala . This well-known litterateur came out as a writer of travestie at the Gaiety in 1869 , but has not been tempted to repeat the achievement . The fact is to be regretted , for his “ Wat Tyler , M. P . ” had many strokes of wit and satire . Wat , being named Tyler , naturally became , in a piece of this genre , a hatter . He is portrayed as aspiring to Parliament , succeeding in his candidature , resisting payment of a tax upon chignons , heading a revolt against the powers that were , penetrating triumphantly into the royal palace , there getting drunk , and being , in the end , overpowered by the forces of the King . In his address to the electors from the hustings , there is a pleasant amalgam of pun and sarcasm . Tyler ( who was impersonated by Mr. Toole ) begins by saying :—</p>

   <p>Jane Shore has been the heroine of a burlesque written by Mr. Wilton Jones , and brought out in the provinces eleven years ago . Messrs. “ Richard Henry ” have also composed a travestie of her story , as handed down by chroniclers . In Mr. Jones 's piece reliance was placed , as of old , upon humorous situation and ear-splitting pun . I give an example of both qualities . Jane has denounced Richard , Duke of Gloucester , as the murderer of the Princes in the Tower , and he now proclaims her doom :—</p>

   <p>In three well-known travesties , Henry VIII . plays the most conspicuous part — in William Brough 's “ Field of the Cloth of Gold ” ( 1868 , Strand ) , in Mr. Burnand 's “ Windsor Castle ” ( Strand , 1865 ) , and Mr. Conway Edwardes ’ “ Anne Boleyn ” ( Royalty , 1872 ) . I name these in the order in which they deal with historical events . In “ The Field of the Cloth of Gold ” Katherine of Arragon is Queen , with Anne Boleyn ( Miss F. Hughes ) as maid of honour and ( as Her Majesty suspects ) a rival . To this suspicion Anne makes reference in the following lines :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Queen Katherine ! her I 'm quite afraid of ;</l>
     <l n="2">She vows it is n't honour that I 'm maid of ;</l>
     <l n="3">Declares King Henry loves me — as for me ,</l>
     <l n="4">I am no better than I ought to be ;</l>
     <l n="5">Such language she employs , I 'm grieved to state</l>
     <l n="6">Queen Kate gets daily more in-daily-Kate .</l>
     <l n="7">If I remonstrate , or to her appeal ,</l>
     <l n="8">Katherine goes off like a Katherine wheel .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In “ Windsor Castle ” the King is in love , more or less , with Anne ( Mr. Thomas Thorne ) , but inclined to let his vagrant fancy wander after Mabel Lynwood ( Miss Ada Swanborough ) , who turns out to be Anne 's sister . Anne , it is recorded , sang like a siren , and was especially addicted to a few French ditties . Of these Mr. Burnand makes her sing a diverting parody , printed , in “ the book of the play , ” in French “ as she is pronounced . ” The song is called</p>

   <p>In “ Anne Boleyn , ” again , Anne ( E. Danvers ) is at last Queen , but with her life embittered by King Henry 's flirtations with Jane Seymour ( Miss Harriet Coveney ) . Thus , in one place , Anne exclaims :—</p>

   <p>“ The Field of the Cloth of Gold ” ( which was revived in London , with only tolerable success , a year or two ago ) has to do mainly with the meeting of Henry VIII . and Francis I . ( Mr. David James ) on that historic spot — an event which is here surrounded with the most ludicrous circumstances possible . There is a sub-plot which deals with the loves of Constance de Grey ( Miss A. Swanborough ) and the Earl of Darnley ( Miss Lydia Thompson ) , as interrupted and jeopardised by the pretensions and machinations of Sir Guy the Cripple ( Mr. Thomas Thorne ) . The comic incidents are somewhat pantomimical , and the main merit of the piece lies in the humour of its dialogue , which is always sparkling . One of the puns in this burlesque is among the very best ever perpetrated , and is , indeed , a historical possession . Need I quote it ? The King has crossed over from Dover to Calais on a stormy day , and arrives in a very “ indisposed ” condition :—</p>
   <p>Henry . I am ill .</p>
   <p>Suffolk . Nay , sire , cheer up , I pray .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Henry . Yesterday all was fair — a glorious Sunday ,</l>
     <l n="2">But this sick transit spoils the glory o ’ Monday .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the piece is full of quips almost equally good . Mark the puns that the two kings fire off at each other when they foregather on the Field of the Cloth of Gold :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Henry . Pshaw ! Bluff King Hal fears not to make advances</l>
     <l n="2">So long as the great King of France is Francis .</l>

   <p>Surrey , in “ Windsor Castle , ” is represented not only as poet but as composer , and in the combined characters puts together a love song addressed to his Geraldine . Unfortunately , when he comes to sing it to her , he finds he has forgotten some of the words :—</p>

   <p>“ Anne Boleyn ” is particularly prolific in good puns , in the making of which the author showed himself an adept . It would be a pleasure to quote a few of them , but I give instead some lines in which , speaking through the mouth of one of his characters , the writer satirises the methods of the old-fashioned drama :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Mine were the “ palmy days ” when , I declare ,</l>
     <l n="2">A little table and two chairs , sir , were</l>
     <l n="3">Thought furniture sufficient for a scene ;</l>
     <l n="4">When a baize drugget — generally green —</l>
     <l n="5">Covered the stage where'er the place was laid ,</l>
     <l n="6">Serving alike for palace , cot or glade ;</l>
     <l n="7">When , in a drawing-room , a servant-maid</l>
     <l n="8">Would sing a duet with the comic man ;</l>
     <l n="9">When dramas only for a few nights ran ;</l>
     <l n="10">When a rhymed tag to every piece was tacked ;</l>
     <l n="11">When most plays had a dozen scenes an act ;</l>
     <l n="12">When bucket boots and ringlet wigs were worn ,</l>
     <l n="13">“ Acting 's a lost art , ” sir , since you were born ;</l>
     <l n="14">Those are the days which I look back upon ,</l>
     <l n="15">Of broadsword combats with — “ Ha , ha ! Come on ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Good Queen Bess was added to Mr. Burnand 's gallery in 1870 , when his “ E-liz-a-beth , or the Don , the Duck , the Drake , and the Invisible Armada , ” was brought out at the Vaudeville , with Mr. Thorne as the Queen , Mr. David James as Whiskerandos , and George Honey as Drake . The “ Maiden Queen ” has not been greatly tantalised by the burlesque writers , who , on the other hand , have made very free with a gentleman who much disturbed her successor — Guy Fawkes . Mr. Burnand handled him in 1866 ( at the Strand ) ; H. J. Byron followed suit at the Gaiety in 1874 ; last year we had the “ Guy Fawkes , Esq . ” of Messrs. “ A. C. Torr ” ( Fred Leslie ) and H. F. Clark ; and I believe that Mr. Wilton Jones , too , has written a travestie on the subject . Charles II . was burlesqued by Mr. Gilbert Arthur a'Beckett in 1872 , the locale being the Court Theatre , and the full title of the piece “ Charles II ., or Something like History . ” In this , as in Mr. Reece 's “ Romulus and Remus , ” there was some parody of the Lyceum “ Charles I . ” — Mr. Righton , as Cromwell , imitating both Mr. Irving and George Belmore , besides indulging in the cancan ! W. J. Hill was the King , and Mme . Cornelie D'Anka the Queen ( Catherine of Braganza ) . Pepys , Rochester , and Lily the Astrologer also figured in the piece . Cromwell was afterwards the leading personage in the “ Oliver Grumble ” of Mr. George Dance ( Novelty , 1886 ) .</p>
   <p>About the names of such heroes and heroines as the Lady Godiva , Dick Whittington , Robin Hood , Herne the Hunter , and those distinguished footpads Claude Duval and Dick Turpin , there hangs a good deal that is clearly mythical . Still , some myths have more real vitality than absolute fact ; and who does not believe firmly that the Lady Godiva rode round Coventry “ clothed on ” with nothing but her chastity , and , by taking away a grinding tax , “ built herself an everlasting name ” ? Her adventure has been burlesqued at least twice — once by Francis Talfourd and a collaborator , at another time by Mr. H. Chance Newton . The Talfourd piece was called “ Godiva , or Y ^ e Ladye of Coventrie and Y ^ e Exyle Fayrie ” and produced at the Strand in 1851 . Mr. Newton christened his work “ Giddy Godiva . ” In the earlier burlesque , “ y ^ e exyle fayrie ” Ignota ( Miss Romer ) is introduced merely as a dea ex machina in the interests of the heroine ( Miss Marshall ) , who , in a passage of Shakespearean reminiscence , discusses the undertaking to which she has been incited by her husband :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To be , or not to be , at his suggestion ,</l>
     <l n="2">A pose plastique , is yet a doubtful question !</l>
     <l n="3">To bare my arms against a sea of troubles ,</l>
     <l n="4">And by a pose to end them ! Each day doubles</l>
     <l n="5">The people 's wrongs , the proud Earl 's heavy tax ;</l>
     <l n="6">To help to ease them I would not be lax ;</l>
     <l n="7">But then to ride — riding , by some low scrub</l>
     <l n="8">Perhaps be seen !— Ah , bother — there 's the rub !</l>
     <l n="9">The fear that still my courage may be less</l>
     <l n="10">When I have shuffled off this mortal dress ,</l>
     <l n="11">Must give me pause .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A prominent character in the piece is Our Own Reporter , “ Y ^ e Specyall Commyssionere and Correspondente of y ^ e Busie Bee ” ( John Reeve ) , who would fain play the part of Peeping Tom , and who , early in the play , sings a song wittily descriptive of his ordinary avocations :—</p>

    <p>VI .</p>
   <p>BURLESQUE OF SHAKESPEARE .</p>
   <p>Travestie of the drama and things dramatic has naturally played a large part in the history of English stage burlesque . Side by side with the producers and interpreters of tragedy , melodrama , and plays of sentiment , have been the possessors of the humorous spirit , who — whether as writers or as actors — have been quick to see the points in which works of serious plan and treatment have been open to the shafts of ridicule and raillery . As we have seen , most of the earliest efforts in English stage burlesque were directed against the extravagant tragedies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . As time went on , and the limits of the serious drama became more extended , so did the limits of burlesque expand , and , from the days of John Poole downwards , the large variety of serious dramatic production has co-existed with a corresponding variety in the subject and style of the travesties submitted to the public .</p>
   <p>Among those travesties a prominent place has been taken by the pieces devoted to the burlesque of Shakespeare — not because they have been particularly numerous , for they have not been so — nor because they have been uniformly successful , for the earlier specimens were singularly weak — but because of the general daring of the attempts , and because also of the genuine sense of fun exhibited by such baiters of “ the Bard ” as Gilbert a'Beckett , Francis Talfourd , Stirling Coyne , William Brough , Andrew Halliday ( Duff ) , F. C. Burnand , H. J. Byron , and W. S. Gilbert . The business of burlesquing Shakespeare has never , so far as I can see , been taken up in a wholesale or an intentionally irreverent spirit . The seventeenth and eighteenth-century satirists left “ the Bard ” severely alone , and it was not until 1810 that the first formal travestie of Shakespeare — Poole 's “ Hamlet Travestie ” — saw the light .<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>The author then made all due apology for his temerity , at the same time pointing out the absurdity of the idea that any amount or kind of burlesque could possibly sully the fame of the dramatist . Two years later , in the course of his preface to the fourth edition of his work , Poole ironically congratulated “ those who , on its first appearance , were apprehensive for the reputation of Shakespeare , ” upon the fact “ that , notwithstanding Three Editions already before the public , he is neither expelled from our libraries , nor banished from our stage . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>It was performed at Covent Garden in 1813 , with Mathews as Hamlet , Blanchard as the King , Liston as Ophelia , and Mrs. Liston as the Queen . It was revived in 1874 on one occasion with Mr. Odell as Hamlet , and shortly afterwards with Mr. Leonard Boyne as the Prince , both actors indulging in an imitation of Mr. Irving 's performance .</p>
   <p>The truth is , a brilliant burlesque does harm to nobody ; and a bad burlesque does but recoil upon the head of its author and his exponents . Poole 's “ Hamlet Travestie ” is marked by the best intentions , but , as a whole , it makes dreary reading . The opening colloquy between Hamlet , King Claudius , and Queen Gertrude will give , to those who have not already perused the piece , a notion of the quality of the dialogue :—</p>
   <p>King ( to Hamlet ) . Cheer up , my son and cousin , never mind —</p>
   <p>Ham . A little more than kin , and less than kind .</p>
   <p>King . Why hang the clouds still on you ? Come , have done .</p>

   <p>The “ annotations ” appended to the text of the burlesque are in parody of the performances of the commentators , who at least are fair game for chaff of this sort , and on whom Poole , in his preface , lavishes some excellent indignation .</p>
   <p>Of subsequent burlesques of “ Hamlet ” there have not been many , but some of them have been really clever and commendable . There was , for instance , Talfourd 's , published at Oxford in 1849 ; there was the “ Hamlet a la Mode ” of Messrs. G. L. Gordon and G. W. Anson , performed at Liverpool in 1877 ; there was the “ Very Little Hamlet ” of Mr. William Yardley , seen at the Gaiety in 1884 ; and last , but assuredly not least , we have had the “ Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ” of Mr. Gilbert , which , written originally without thought either of public or of private representation , has been enacted at a benefit matinee during the present year .</p>
   <p>In “ Rosencrantz and Guildenstern , ” which is an unpretentious little “ skit , ” covering only some sixteen or seventeen printed pages , Mr. Gilbert supposes that Hamlet is the son ( not the step-son ) of Claudius . “ Rosencrantz is a lover of Ophelia , to whom Hamlet is betrothed , and they lay their heads together to devise a plan by which Hamlet may be put out of the way . Some Court theatricals are in preparation . ” Now , once upon a time , Claudius had written a tragedy , which was damned , and to which no one is allowed to make reference on pain of death . “ Ophelia and Rosencrantz persuade Hamlet to play his father 's tragedy before the king and court . Hamlet , who is unaware of the proscription , does so ; and he is banished , and Rosencrantz happily united to Ophelia . ”</p>
   <p>In the first act , Rosencrantz , who has never seen Hamlet ( apparently , because the former has been abroad ) , asks Ophelia what the Prince is like , and that gives Mr. Gilbert an opportunity for some characteristic satire . Ophelia says of Hamlet that he is “ alike for no two seasons at a time ":—</p>

   <p>Claud . And of what fashion is the Prince 's play ?</p>
   <p>Ros . ‘ Tis an excellent poor tragedy , my Lord — a thing of shreds and patches welded into a form that hath mass without consistency , like an ill-built villa .</p>
   <p>Queen . But , sir , you should have used your best endeavours to wean his phantasy from such a play .</p>
   <p>Ros . Madam , I did , and with some success ; for he now seeth the absurdity of its tragical catastrophes , and laughs at it as freely as we do .

   <p>After Poole published his “ Hamlet ,"[ 37 ] Shakespearean burlesque slumbered until 1834 , when Maurice G. Dowling produced at Liverpool his “ Othello Travestie . ” In this dull production , the Moor of Venice figures as “ an independent nigger from the Republic of Hayti , ” and talks in “ darkey ” dialect ( as does the same writer 's Clifford in “ Fair Rosamond ” ) . Here , for example , is this Othello 's address to the Senate ( written and sung to the air of “ Yankee Doodle ” ):—</p>

   <p>W. J. Hammond played Othello in this piece , both at Liverpool , and afterwards at the Strand Theatre , where popular Miss E. Daly was the Desdemona and H. Hall the Iago . What can these presumably capable actors have thought of their roles ? The text of the burlesque is almost wholly without humour , of which , however , there is a gleam in the complaint made by Cassio that he has been ruined by a pint of beer :—</p>

   <p>H. J. Byron 's “ Rival Othellos ” ( played at the Strand in 1876 ) was not a travestie of the tragedy ; but it gave opportunity for some clever burlesque of tragic acting .</p>
   <p>We come now to the first ( and , so far as I know , the only ) travestie of “ King John , ” which happily was essayed by the capable pen of Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett . The year was 1837 , the locale the St. James 's Theatre , and Hall the representative of the title-part , with Mme . Sala as Lady Constance . The play was lucky in being dealt with by so deft a workman . The subject was not very promising , and all was done with it that was possible . The scene in which the King incites Hubert to get rid of Arthur was thus travestied :—</p>

   <p>After “ Romeo and Juliet , ” the first of Shakespeare 's plays to be burlesqued was “ Richard III ., ” of which Charles Selby , the comedian , and Stirling Coyne , the well-known man of letters , each perpetrated a travestie in 1844 . Selby 's piece<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>was founded on the Colley Cibber adaptation , and introduced Henry VI ., who , at the end , was represented as coming to life again and quietly assuming the crown which Richmond was about to take . Richard also is resuscitated , after a fashion very popular in burlesques of Shakespeare . Of literary merit Selby 's work had little .</p>

   <p>Twenty-four years later , Mr. Burnand took up this subject . His work was called “ The Rise and Fall of Richard III ., ” and was performed at the Royalty . His treatment of the wooing scene may well be contrasted with that of Selby . For instance :—</p>
   <p>Richard . I see that you a passion for me foster ——</p>
   <p>Anne . Passion for you ! High , mighty , double Glo'ster .</p>

   <p>Talfourd 's “ Macbeth , somewhat removed from the Text of Shakespeare , ” was first performed in 1847 at Henley-on-Thames during the regatta ; next , at the Strand , in 1848 ; afterwards at the Olympic , in 1853 . At the last-named theatre it had the advantage of the aid of Robson in the title-part , of G. Cooke as Duncan , and of Mrs. A. Phillips as Lady Macbeth . It paraphrases the original fairly well until near the close , when , after Macduff has slain Macbeth , Duncan reappears ( like Henry VI . in Selby 's piece ) and takes the crown from Malcolm . Similarly , Macbeth , his wife , and Banquo turn up again , and announce their willingness to die nightly .</p>
   <p>In the first act Lady Macbeth comes in reading her husband 's letter , as follows :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">We met , ‘ twas on a heath , and on that day</l>
     <l n="2">When victory had flushed us ; really they</l>

   <p>The first burlesque of “ The Tempest ” made its appearance at the Adelphi in 1848 . It was from the pen of the Brothers Brough , and was entitled “ The Enchanted Isle , or Raising the Wind on the most Approved Principles . ” “ O . ” Smith was Prospero , with Miss Taylor as his daughter Miranda ; Miss Woolgar being the Ferdinand , with Paul Bedford for her father — the Ariel Mme . Celeste , and the Caliban Munyard . Some years were destined to elapse before the subject again attracted the burlesque writer ; and the writer then was Mr. Burnand , who gave to his work the name of “ Ariel , ” submitting it to the public in 1883 at the Gaiety . Miss Ellen Farren took the title-part , with Mr. Henry Monkhouse as Prospero , Mr. Frank Wyatt as Sebastian , Mr. Dallas as Alonso , and Miss Connie Gilchrist as Miranda . This “ perversion ” was in three acts , and was one of the productions which led the way to the New Burlesque .</p>
   <p>To Talfourd belongs the distinction of being the first to burlesque “ The Merchant of Venice . ” He called his work “ Shylock , or the Merchant of Venice Preserved : an entirely New Reading of Shakespeare , from an edition hitherto undiscovered by modern authorities , and which it is hoped may be received as the stray leaves of a Jerusalem Hearty-Joke . ” This came out at the Olympic in 1853 , and again Talfourd had Robson as the exponent of his principal character . Again , too , he followed his original with some care , burlesquing rather in detail than on broad lines . Take , for example , his “ reading ” of a portion of the trial scene . Shylock has been foiled by Portia , and wishes to leave the court :—</p>
   <p>Shy . Give me my principal , and I 'll away .</p>
   <lg>

   <p>Mr. Burnand has written two burlesques on “ Antony and Cleopatra ” — one brought out under that title at the Haymarket in 1866 ; the other produced at the Gaiety in 1873 , under the name of “ Our Own Antony and Cleopatra . ” A third travestie of the tragedy , called “ Mdlle . Cleopatra , ” and written by Mr. W. Sapte , junior , was seen at the Avenue in the present year .</p>

     <l n="5">It goes back , for subject , so far as Lee 's high-sounding “ Alexander</l>
     <l n="6">the Great ” ( better known , perhaps , as “ The Rival Queens ” ) , which ,</l>
     <l n="7">first produced in 1678 , was travestied by Dibdin , in “ Alexander the</l>
     <l n="8">Great in Little , ” a “ grand tragi-comic operatic burlesque spectacle , ”</l>
     <l n="9">originally seen at the Strand in 1837 , with Hammond as Alexander and</l>
     <l n="10">Mrs. Stirling as Roxana . Seven years later there was performed at the</l>
     <l n="11">Surrey a burlesque , by Montagu Corri , of Lillo 's famous tragedy “ George</l>
     <l n="12">Barnwell ” ( 1730 ) , here called “ Georgy Barnwell ” — a title which H. J .</l>
     <l n="13">Byron altered to “ George De Barnwell ” when in 1862 he travestied the</l>
     <l n="14">old play at the Adelphi .</l>

   <p>We have already seen that , in his “ Quadrupeds of Quedlinburgh , ” Colman junior extracted some fun out of scenes in “ The Stranger , ” “ Pizarro , ” and “ Timour the Tartar . ” The first of these plays was made the subject of more elaborate satire in 1868 , when Mr. Robert Reece wrote for the New Queen 's Theatre his burlesque called “ The Stranger , Stranger than Ever ! ” This , with Miss Santley as Peter , Mr. Lionel Brough as the Stranger , and Miss Henrietta Hodson as Mrs. Haller , had many points of attraction . In this reductio ad absurdum the lady 's chief complaint is that her husband first neglected her and then deserted her , taking away the children . Moreover , “ he taught the infants all the comic songs , ” and so , “ instead of gloating over Peter Parley , the boy declared himself as Champagne Charley . ” In despair the deserted one set to work and took in washing :—</p>

     <l n="4">“ Tub be or not tub be ? ” that was the question .</l>
     <l n="5">So with a will I turned me to my work ,</l>
     <l n="6">Carried a blue bag like a lawyer 's clerk ;</l>
     <l n="7">Yet still I grieved — the trade 's of woe prolific ,</l>
     <l n="8">I could n't sleep , for all this soap-horrific ;</l>
     <l n="9">Hard was my lot , for I could plainly see</l>
     <l n="10">My source of living must end sud-denly ;</l>
     <l n="11">And in her downward course , say , what could stop her</l>
     <l n="12">Whose sole subsistence was a single copper ?</l>

   <p>“ The Wood-Demon , ” by “ Monk ” Lewis , played originally in 1811 , suggested to Albert Smith and Charles Kenny a travestie , of the same name , which they brought out at the Lyceum in 1847 . “ Timour the Tartar , ” another of Lewis 's dramas , received equally satiric treatment at the hands of John Oxenford and Shirley Brooks , whose work made its appearance at the Olympic in 1860 . In the last-named year Messrs. Francis Talfourd and H. J. Byron founded on Pocock 's “ Miller and his Men ” ( 1813 ) a “ mealy-drama , ” similarly entitled , which was played at the Strand .</p>

   <p>Five years after the production of Jerrold 's play , the London stage was surfeited for a time with adaptations from the French , all bearing upon the evils of the gaming-table . These bore such titles as “ The Gambler 's Fate , ” “ Thirty Years of a Gambler 's Life , ” and so on , and were brought out at Drury Lane , the Surrey ( by Elliston ) , and the Adelphi ( by Terry and Yates ) . They did not last , however ; and “ The Elbow-Shakers , or Thirty Years of a Rattler 's Life , ” in which Fox Cooper made fun of them , was scarcely needed to effect their overthrow . Reeve and Yates were the two Elbow-Shakers , but the piece had little intrinsic value .</p>
   <p>In 1867 , at the Haymarket , Mr. Gilbert Arthur a'Beckett brought out a travestie of Planche 's “ Brigand ” ( 1829 ) , under the title of “ The Brigand , or New Lines to an Old Ban-Ditty . ” In this , Massaroni , the hero , was represented by Compton as a poltroon , objecting very much to the dictation of Marie Grazia as portrayed by Ione Burke . Young Mr. Kendal also had a part in this production . Nor had we yet done with the old school of melodrama . Yet another specimen thereof was destined to come under the lash of the parodist — namely , the piece called “ My Poll and my Partner Joe , ” written by J. T. Haines , first seen at the Surrey in 1838 , and interpreted by T. P. Cooke as Harry Halyard , R. Honner as Joe Tiller , and Miss Honner as Poll ( Mary Maybud ) . The “ happy thought ” of burlesquing this typical piece came to Mr. Burnand , who , in his travestie named after the original , made , at the St. James 's in 1871 , a success second only to that of “ Black-ey 'd Susan . ” It was in this burlesque that Mrs. John Wood ( as Mary ) had so notable a triumph with her song , “ His Heart was true to Poll , ” which she still sings sometimes in public . Miss Emma Chambers was the Harry in this piece , and Mr. Lionel Brough the Black Brandon , with Harry Cox , Gaston Murray , and Miss Sallie Turner in other parts .</p>
   <p>Now comes the turn of the poetic drama , as represented in and by the works of Lord Byron , Sergeant Talfourd , the first Lord Lytton , and Mr. W. S. Gilbert . The first of Lord Byron 's plays to be burlesqued was “ Manfred , ” which fell to the lot of Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett in 1834 . In the “ burlesque ballet opera , ” called “ Man-Fred , ” which thus issued from A'Beckett ' s pen , Man-Fred figured as a master-sweep , very much perturbed and disturbed by the Act in reference to chimney-sweeping which had just been passed , and which , he plaintively declares , has killed the trade :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">That horrible new act has marr 'd his pleasure ;</l>
     <l n="2">It really was a very sweeping measure .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">His lady-love , Ann Starkie , is equally unfortunate in her</l>
     <l n="4">business — that of apple-seller . As she remarks :—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ The trade is at a stand , ” the people whine :</l>
     <l n="6">If it be at a stand , ‘ tis not at mine .</l>
     <l n="7">In vain down Fleet Street with my wares I go ;</l>
     <l n="8">Though Fleet they call the street , its trade is slow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="9">In the course of the piece Ann appears disguised as Mme . Grisi , and</l>
     <l n="10">some badinage is directed at the “ stars ” of the Italian Opera .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A'Beckett further undertook , along with Mark Lemon , a skit upon another of the Byronic dramas — “ Sardanapalus ” — which they reproduced as “ Sardanapalus , or the ‘ Fast ’ King of Assyria . ” The Adelphi was the theatre of operations ; 1853 was the year ; and while Miss Woolgar was Sardanapalus , Paul Bedford was Arbaces , Keeley was Salymenia ( mother of the Queen ) , Miss Maskell was Beleses , and Miss Mary Keeley was Altada . Arbaces is here shown as impervious to the charm of melody :—</p>

   <p>In 1858 came , from the workshop of H. J. Byron , the first travestie of his “ noble kinsman 's ” play , “ Mazeppa . ” This , produced at the Olympic , had Robson for its hero , with other parts in the hands of Horace Wigan , Mr. Lewis Ball , Miss Wyndham , Miss Bromley , and Mrs. W. S. Emden . Of its punning dialogue , which throughout is in the genuine H. J. Byronic manner , the following is a fair example . Olinska is conversing with her father , the Castellan :—</p>

     <l n="22">The subject of “ Mazeppa ” was afterwards treated by Mr. Burnand in a</l>
     <l n="23">burlesque brought out at the Gaiety in 1885 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Of Sergeant Talfourd 's dramatic works the only one , apparently , that has been travestied is “ Ion , ” which had to submit to the ridicule of Fox Cooper in 1836 . In that year Cooper 's perversion was played both at the Garrick Theatre and at the Queen 's , in the first case with Conquest as the hero , in the latter with a lady in the role — an arrangement quite defensible , inasmuch as , in the original play , the name-part had been played ( at the Haymarket ) by Ellen Tree .</p>
   <p>The pseudo-Elizabethanisms of Sheridan Knowles naturally attracted the attention of the comic playwrights . The opportunities were , indeed , only too tempting ; and so I have to record the production of burlesques based upon five plays — “ The Wife , ” “ Virginius , ” “ Alfred the Great , ” “ William Tell , ” and “ The Hunchback . ” The first named has for its full title “ The Wife : a Tale of Mantua . ” The “ burlesque burletta , ” by Joseph Graves ( Strand , 1837 ) , is called “ The Wife : a Tale of a Mantua Maker . ” Mariana ( first played by Ellen Tree ) here becomes Mary Ann Phipps , the said mantua-maker ; Floribel is Flora , a servant-of-all-work . Leonardo and Ferrardo Gonzaga figure as Marmaduke Jago , landlord of the Green Man , and Zachariah Jago , usurping that dignity ; Count Florio is Floor'em ( a police-sergeant ) , Julian St. Pierre is Jack Peters — and so forth . The travestie is fairly close , but the wit and humour are not of brilliant quality . Even less to be commended is “ Virginius the Rum ‘ Un , ” perpetrated by William Rogers , the comedian , and performed at Sadler 's Wells in the same year as Graves 's effort . This is but a tedious assault upon “ Virginius . ” The scene is laid in Islington , and Virginius is a butcher . Appius Claudius , here called Sappyis , is a sergeant of police . Dentatus is “ Tentaties ” ; Icilius is “ Isilyus . ” Claudius claims Virginia as his apprentice , and Virginius stabs her with a skewer ; the instrument , however , sticks only in her stay-bone , and so no harm is done .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Virginius ” had very much more justice done to it when Leicester</l>
     <l n="2">Buckingham made it the basis of a burlesque at the St. James 's in</l>
     <l n="3">1859 . Then Charles Young was the Virginius , Mrs. Frank Matthews the</l>
     <l n="4">Virginia , and Miss Lydia Thompson a “ Mysterious Stranger , ” introduced ,</l>
     <l n="5">apparently , only for the sake of a pas seul . In this piece the puns</l>
     <l n="6">are very plentiful , if not always good . Thus , Virginia says :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Oh , deary me ! each day I 'm growing thinner :</l>
     <l n="8">Nurse says , because I never eat my dinner ;</l>

   <p>Virginius , like so many other burlesque characters , delivers himself of a reminiscence of “ To be or not to be , ” and at the close it is found that Virginius has not really killed his daughter , because she “ pads . ”</p>
   <p>“ Alfred the Great , ” one of Knowles ’ historical plays , suggested portions of the burlesque called “ Alfred the Great , or the Minstrel King , ” which Robert B. Brough wrote for the Olympic in 1859 . In this , Robson was the King , Miss Herbert his aide-de-camp , and F. Vining his commander-in-chief , with other parts by Horace Wigan and Miss Hughes . Knowles 's “ William Tell ” ( 1825 ) , or the story embodied in it has been the basis of half a dozen travesties . First came Mr. Burnand 's “ William Tell , ” at Drury Lane , in 1856 ; next , Leicester Buckingham 's , at the Strand , in 1857 ; next , Talfourd 's “ Tell ! and the Strike of the Cantons , or the Pair , the Meddler , and the Apple ! ” at the Strand , in 1859-60 ; next , again , Byron 's “ William Tell with a Vengeance ! or the Pet , the Parrot , and the Pippin , ” at the Strand , in 1867 ; a few days later , A. J. O'Neill ' s “ William Tell , ” at Sadler 's Wells ; and , lastly — so far — Mr. Reece 's “ William Tell told Over Again , ” at the Gaiety , in 1876 . “ The Hunchback ” has been “ guyed ” less often than might have been expected , considering its popularity . Mr. Burnand brought out at the Olympic , in 1879 , “ The Hunchback Back Again , ” and this comic version of the hackneyed old play is not likely to be superseded .</p>
   <p>The first Lord Lytton 's verse-plays — bristling as they do with fustian and bombast — have naturally been frequently travestied . Note the number of occasions on which “ The Lady of Lyons ” has fallen a prey to the irreverent . Altogether there have been six notable burlesques of this drama . H. J. Byron wrote two , the first of which — “ The Latest Edition of the Lady of Lyons ” — was produced at the Strand in 1858 . This , in the following year , was freshened up and re-presented to the public as “ The Very Latest Edition ” of the popular drama .</p>
   <p>In 1878 , at the Gaiety , came Mr. Herman Merivale 's “ vaudeville , ” “ The Lady of Lyons Married and Settled , ” which is not only quite the best of the travesties on this topic , but one of the cleverest ever written . It sparkles with good things from beginning to end . Claude , it seems , has “ taken to philosophy , and says we are all descended from monkeys . ” It is not surprising , therefore , to find him singing a long song in praise of the Darwinian theory :—</p>

   <p>This has some claim to rank with the ditties on the same subject by Lord Neaves and Mortimer Collins . But Claude has also gone in for something less innocent than Darwinianism . He is flirting with Babette , a pretty laundry-maid , the beloved of Gaspar . Of her , Gaspar sings as follows , in a clever parody of “ Sally in our Alley ":—</p>

     <l n="24">But , ah ! she 'll never let ‘ ee !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the course of the piece there is a good deal of direct parody of Lytton 's style , both in prose and verse . For example , Claude says at one point to Babette :—</p>
   <p>Come with me to my mother 's lonely cot ! I have preserved it ever in memory of mine early youth ; and , believe me , that the prize of virtue never , beneath my father 's honest roof , even villains dared to mar ! Now , maiden , now , I think thou wilt believe me ! Wilt come ?</p>
   <p>Babette . I wilt !</p>
   <p>Again :—</p>
   <p>In the sweet suburb of Richemont or Tedainton , on the banks of the broad Garonne , one of those expensive spots where , during the summer months , the river is at the bottom of the lawn — during the winter , the lawn at the bottom of the river — but where it is damp-pleasant all the year round ; there will we babble to the murmuring stream , and the babbling stream shall murmur back to us , and softly whisper ——</p>
   <p>Dowager Morier ( coming down ) . Hold on !<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>Mr. Merivale was fortunate in the cast of his production ( played at the Gaiety in 1878 ) . Mr. Edward Terry was the Claude , Miss Farren the Pauline , Mr. Royce the “ Beauseong , ” Mrs. Leigh the Dowager Morier , and Miss Amalia the Babette , other parts being taken by Messrs. Elton , Maclean , Squire , and Fawcett .</p>
   <p>After Mr. Merivale 's piece came one on the same subject by Mr. W. Younge ( 1879 ) ; another by Mr. Clifton ( Lyne ) , played in the country in 1882 ; and yet another , by Mr. Reece ( also played in the country ) in 1884 . This last was entitled “ The Lady of Lyons Married and Claude Unsettled . ”</p>
   <p>Ten years after the first burlesque of “ The Lady of Lyons ” appeared the first burlesque of Lord Lytton 's “ Rightful Heir . ” This was “ The Frightful Hair ” of Mr. Burnand , seen at the Haymarket in 1868-9 . In 1868 also , publicity was given to “ The Right-Fall Heir ” of Mr. H. T. Arden .</p>
   <p>In the autumn of 1873 Mr. Irving revived at the Lyceum Lord Lytton 's “ Richelieu , ” and the play was speedily followed at the Olympic by the “ Richelieu Redressed ” of Mr. Reece . This is remarkable , to begin with , as being written throughout in blank verse — an agreeable departure from the time-honoured couplet . The general travestie is close , and there is a certain amount of direct parody , as where Richelieu is made to say that</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In the great Lexicon of Politics</l>
     <l n="2">There 's no such word as Truth !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the “ curse of Rome ” scene , Richelieu draws around himself “ the awful circle of the Daily Press ! ” Fun , too , is made of the well-known exit of Baradas at the words “ All in despite of my lord Cardinal , ” and also of the various ways in which actors are wont to pronounce the simple word “ Julie . ” The piece has a strong political flavour throughout , in compliment , no doubt , to the general election , which was then in prospect . Richelieu thus soliloquises :—</p>

   <p>It was characteristic of Mr. W. S. Gilbert that he should himself set the example of burlesquing his own work . I have already made reference to “ The Happy Land , ” the travestie of his “ Wicked World , ” which he and Mr. Gilbert Arthur a'Beckett prepared for the Court Theatre in 1873 . It was in this piece that the personal appearance of three prominent living statesmen was closely imitated by certain of the performers , with the result of bringing down upon the culprits the veto of His High-and-Mightiness the Lord Chamberlain . In 1876 two of Mr. Gilbert 's plays were burlesqued — “ Broken Hearts ” and “ Dan'l Druce ” ; the former under the name of “ Cracked Heads , ” the latter under that of “ Dan'l TrahYpppHeNDuced ” ; both being brought out at the same theatre — the Strand , and both being the work of the same author — Mr. Arthur Clements , who , however , had in “ Cracked Heads ” the assistance of Mr. Frederick Hay . “ Dan'l Druce ” was not a particularly good subject ; but “ Broken Heads , ” with its occasionally overstrained sentiment , was fairly open to polite ridicule . In the original , the Lady Vavir feigns love for a sun-dial , while the Lady Hilda expends much sentiment upon a streamlet . In “ Cracked Heads ” the Lady Vapid bestows her affections upon a clock , and the Lady Tilda hers upon a pump . Says the latter to the former :—</p>
   <p>Why do you love the clock , good sister ? tell .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Vapid . The earth goes round ; the moon , with silvery smile ;</l>
     <l n="2">The p'lice cerulean who the cooks beguile ;</l>
     <l n="3">The turncock , too , precursor of the spring ;</l>
     <l n="4">The German band , and all that sort of thing .</l>
     <l n="5">Most things go round , in fact ; and who shall mock ?</l>
     <l n="6">The clock goes round : that 's why I love the clock .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In this genial little piece , presented at the Strand in 1876 , Mr. Edward Terry was the monster , here called Monsta ; Miss Lottie Venne and Miss Angelina Claude were the ladies Tilda and Vapid , and Mr. Harry Cox was the Prince Florian , here called Dorian . It will be remembered , by the way , that it has been the fate of one of Mr. Gilbert 's comic operas to be parodied — surely a case of gilding refined gold ! The opera was “ Ruddigore , ” which was chaffed , more or less effectively , in the little piece d'occasion called “ Ruddy George , or Robin Redbreast , ” brought out at Toole 's Theatre in 1887 .</p>
   <p>The melodrama of the last half-century has received due attention at the hands of the stage satirists . Buckstone 's “ Green Bushes , ” for example , had its comic counterpart in H. J. Byron 's “ Grin Bushes , ” performed at the Strand in 1864 . It was Byron , too , who burlesqued Boucicault 's “ Colleen Bawn , ” under the title of “ Little Eily O'Connor ” ( Drury Lane , 1861 ) . The story of Rip Van Winkle , made so popular in England by Mr. Jefferson , has been handled in the spirit of travestie both by Mr. Reece ( at the Folly in 1876 ) and by Mr. H. Savile Clarke ( in 1880 ) . “ The Lights o ’ London ” suggested “ The De-lights of London ” ( 1882 ) , which we owed to the co-operation of Messrs. Mackay , Lennard , and Gordon . After “ The Silver King ” came “ Silver Guilt , ” a clever piece by Mr. Warham St. Leger , in which , at the Strand in 1883 , Miss Laura Linden imitated Miss Eastlake to admiration . In like manner , after “ Claudian ” came the diverting “ Paw Claw-dian ” of Mr. Burnand , which , at Toole 's in 1884 , gave Miss Marie Linden the opportunity of emulating ( as Almi-i-da ) her sister 's success . In this piece Mr. Toole , as Claudian , and E. D. Ward , as Coal-Holey Clement , were particularly amusing . “ Chatterton , ” another of Mr. Wilson Barrett 's triumphs , has lately reappeared , disguised as “ Shatter 'd Un ” — the author in this instance being Mr. A . Chevalier . “ In the Ranks ” naturally led to the production of “ Out of the Ranks ” ( by Mr. Reece , Strand , 1884 ) ; and “ Called Back ” was found especially provocative of ridicule , no fewer than three travesties being written — Mr. Herman Merivale 's “ Called There and Back ” ( Gaiety , 1884 ) , Mr. Yardley 's “ The Scalded Back ” ( Novelty , 1884 ) , and Mr. Chevalier 's “ Called Back again ” ( Plymouth , 1885 ) .</p>
   <p>In 1888 Mrs. Bernard Beere was playing at the Opera Comique in “ Ariane , ” a rather full-blooded drama by Mrs. Campbell Praed . This was at once burlesqued at the Strand by Mr. Burnand , whose “ Airey Annie ” ( as rendered by Mr. Edouin , Miss Atherton , and Miss Ayrtoun ) proved to be a very mirth-provoking product . The heroine , Airey Annie thus accounted for her sobriquet :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Untaught , untidy , hair all out of curl ,</l>
     <l n="2">A gutter child , a true Bohemian girl ,</l>
     <l n="3">Like Nan , in “ Good for Nothing , ” so I played ,</l>
     <l n="4">And up and down the airey steps I strayed ,</l>
     <l n="5">Until the little boys about began</l>
     <l n="6">To call me by the name of “ Airey Anne . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Among miscellaneous satires upon the conventional stage products may be named Byron 's “ Rosebud of Stinging-Nettle Farm ” ( Crystal Palace , 1862 ) , Mr. Reece 's “ Brown and the Brahmins ” ( Globe , 1869 ) , and Mr. Matthison 's “ More than Ever ” ( Gaiety and Court , 1882 ) — the last-named being written in ridicule of the modern Surrey-side “ blood-curdler . ”</p>
   <p>So much for the travestie of English melodrama . When we come to deal with the burlesque of melodrama derived from the French , a large field opens out before us . Going back to 1850 , we find that Hugo 's “ Notre Dame , ” as dramatised in England , has suggested to Albert Smith a comic piece called “ Esmeralda , ” brought out at the Adelphi . The subject is next taken up by H. J. Byron , whose “ Esmeralda or the ‘ Sensation ’ Goat ” belongs to the Strand and 1861 . Then Fanny Josephs was the Esmeralda , Marie Wilton the Gringoire , Eleanor Bufton the Phoebus , Clarke the Quasimodo , and Rogers the Claude Frollo . Gringoire was made to introduce himself in this punning fashion :—</p>

   <p>In 1879 , at the Gaiety , Byron returned to the topic , and produced the piece which he called “ Pretty Esmeralda . ” At the same theatre , in 1887 , one saw the same subject treated in the “ Miss Esmeralda ” of Messrs. F. Leslie and H. Mills — a piece in which Miss Marion Hood , as the heroine , played prettily to the Frollo of Mr. E. J. Lonnen , and in which the late George Stone laid the foundation of his too brief success .</p>
   <p>Boucicault 's version of “ Les Freres Corses ” was produced in London by Charles Kean in 1852 , and was quickly followed by a travestie . This was furnished by Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett and Mark Lemon at the Haymarket ( April , 1852 ) , under the title of “ O Gemini ! or the Brothers of Co ( u ) rse . ” Those who did not witness the production can nevertheless conceive how droll Buckstone must have been as the Brothers , and how well he was supported by Bland , also in a dual role — that of Meynard and Montgiron ( or Montegridiron , as he was called ) — and by Mrs. L. S. Buckingham as Chateau Renaud . The burlesque was not wholly of the punning sort ; it relied chiefly upon its travestie of the incidents in the original play . Fabien was made to give ( to the sound of “ low music ” ) the following account of the extraordinary sympathy existing between himself and his brother :—</p>

   <p>H. J. Byron , who travestied nearly everything , of course did not let the “ Corsican Brothers ” escape him , and his “ Corsican ‘ Bothers ’ ” duly figured at the Globe in 1869 . Messrs. Burnand and H. P. Stephens followed , at the Gaiety in 1880 , with “ The Corsican Brothers &amp; Co ., ” and in 1881 ( at the Royalty ) Mr. G. R. Sims made his debut as a writer of burlesque with “ The Of Course-Akin-Brothers , Babes in the Wood . ” In this he began the action with Fabien and Louis as the Babes and Chateau Renaud as the Wicked Uncle , introducing a certain Rosie Posie , who is maid to Mme . dei Franchi and sweetheart of Alfred Meynard . At the end of the first scene Father Time came on , and summed up the situation in a song :—</p>

     <l n="17">Previous to the first entry of Louis ’ ghost , Fabien says :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="18">I feel so strange , I know poor Loo is seedy ;</l>
     <l n="19">I dreamt I saw his ghost all pale and bleedy .</l>

   <p>Of the other puns in the piece the following are perhaps fair specimens . At the bal masque , Louis , meeting Emilie de Lesparre , says :—</p>

   <p>The latest of the burlesques on this subject was supplied — also for the Royalty — by Mr. Cecil Raleigh , whose “ New Corsican Brothers ” played in 1889 , had more than one whimsical feature to recommend it . One of the brothers ( Mr. Arthur Roberts ) was supposed to be an English linen-draper , who , whenever anything was happening to the other brother , had a wild desire to measure out tape — and so on . The dialogue was in prose .</p>
   <p>“ Belphegor , ” the generic name bestowed upon the numerous adaptations of “ Paillasse , ” gave birth to at least one travestie of importance — that by Leicester Buckingham , which saw the light at the Strand in 1856 , the year in which Charles Dillon played in one of the adaptations ( at the Lyceum ) . “ The Duke 's Motto , ” in which Fechter “ starred ” at the same theatre , was the origin of H. J. Byron 's “ The Motto : I am ‘ All There ’ ” — a piece seen at the Strand in 1863 , with Miss Maria Simpson as the Duke Gonzaque , George Honey as Lagardere , and Ada Swanborough and Fanny Josephs as Blanche and Pepita . Among much which is mere punning , though deter enough for that commodity , I find this little bit of social satire :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

   <p>It is to H. J. Byron that we owe the burlesque of “ Robert Macaire , ” which , with Fanny Josephs and J. Clarke as Macaire and Strop , brightened the boards of the Globe Theatre in 1870 . The drama of which Ruy Blas is the central figure has been twice travestied among us — once in 1873 by Mr. Reece ( “ Ruy Blas Righted , ” at the Vaudeville ) , and more recently ( in 1889 ) by Messrs. F. Leslie and H. Clark ( “ Ruy Blas , or the Blase Roue , ” at the Gaiety ) . “ Diplomacy , ” adapted from “ Dora , ” appealed to Mr. Burnand 's sense of the ridiculous , and the result was “ Dora and Diplunacy ” ( Strand , 1878 ) , in which the weak spots of the original were divertingly laid bare . In the same year , Mr. Burnand burlesqued , at the Royalty , his own adaptation , “ Proof , or a Celebrated Case , ” under the title of “ Over-Proof , or What was Found in a Celebrated Case . ” To 1879 belong two clever travesties — “ Another Drink , ” by Messrs. Savile Clarke and Clifton ( Lyne ) , suggested by “ Drink , ” and brought out at the Folly ; and “ Under-Proof , ” Mr. Edward Rose 's reductio ad absurdum of “ Proof . ” In the latter piece , besides many well-constructed puns , there are many pleasant turns of humour , as when Pierre satirises the conventional stage pronunciation of his name :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In my native land , as you 're aware ,</l>
     <l n="2">My Christian name 's pronounced like this — Pi-erre ,</l>
     <l n="3">But here I 'm made a nobleman of France ,</l>
     <l n="4">For everybody calls me Peer Lorance .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Of the Anglo-French melodrama of recent years , Mr. Burnand has been the frequent and successful satirist . He capped “ Fedora ” with “ Stage-Dora ” ( Toole 's , 1883 ) , “ Theodora ” with “ The O'Dora ” ( same theatre , 1885 ) , and “ La Tosca ” with “ Tra la la Tosca ” ( Royalty , 1890 ) . This last contained some of the happiest of its author 's efforts , in the way both of ingenious punning and effective rhyming . Here , for example , is a song put into the mouth of the Baron Scarpia , the “ villain ” both of the play and of the travestie :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I am the bad Baron Scarpia !</l>
     <l n="2">You know it at once , and how sharp y'are .</l>

   <p>During the present year , the interest gradually excited by successive performances of plays by Henrik Ibsen has culminated in the production of the inevitable burlesques . More than one clever travestie of Ibsen has been printed — e. g ., those by Mr. J. P. Hurst and Mr. Wilton Jones ; but the first to be performed was that entitled “ Ibsen 's Ghost , or Toole up to Date , ” which is from the witty pen of Mr. J. M. Barrie . This starts as a sort of sequel to “ Hedda Gabler , ” which it mainly satirises ; but there are allusions also to “ Ghosts ” and to “ A Doll 's House , ” with some general sarcasm at the expense of Ibsen 's peculiarities . The dialogue is in prose , with a concluding vocal quartett ; the writer 's touch is as light as it is true ; and the composition , as a whole , is thoroughly exhilarating . The three-act piece , “ The Gifted Lady , ” in which Mr. Robert Buchanan sought to ridicule not only Ibsen but other “ emancipating ” agencies of the time , was , unfortunately , not so successful as Mr. Barrie 's slighter and brighter work . It abounded in excellent epigram , but lacked geniality and humour . In “ Ibsen 's Ghost ” Mr. Toole and Miss Eliza Johnstone renewed old successes , while Miss Irene Vanbrugh gave signs of aptitude for burlesque . In “ The Gifted Lady ” Miss Fanny Brough , Miss Cicely Richards , Mr. W. H. Vernon , and Mr. Harry Paulton showed all their usual skill , but , unfortunately , to no purpose .</p>
   <p>VIII .</p>
   <p>BURLESQUE OF OPERA .</p>
   <p>We have already seen that , in burlesquing mythology , faerie , and other matters , our comic playwrights have not been able to resist the temptation to introduce occasional travesties of things operatic . Opera , indeed , has always had a magnetic power over them . They have been unable to maintain their gravity in presence of the singularities which distinguish opera , even in its most modern guise , from the more natural and realistic drama . Operatic conditions demand , of necessity , certain stereotyped regulations , especially of stage management , which detract from probability and excite derision . Especially is this so in the case of the older school of Opera , and notably in that of the Italian school , whose products were largely on the same simple and ingenuous model — a model on which the travestie writers were able to construct some genuinely entertaining imitations .</p>
   <p>Beginning , then , with the Italian school , we note that Donizetti has been particularly favoured by the parodists . His “ Lucrezia Borgia , ” “ Linda di Chamouni , ” “ Elisir d ’ Amore , ” and “ Fille du Regiment ” have all had to submit to deliberate perversion . Of “ Lucrezia ” there have been three notable burlesques — one by Leicester Buckingham , at the St. James 's , in 1860 ; another by Sydney French , at the Marylebone , in 1867 ; and the third by H. J. Byron , at the Holborn , in 1868 . Buckingham 's was entitled “ Lucrezia Borgia ! at Home , and all Abroad , ” and had Charles Young for the exponent of the title character . Miss Wyndham was Johnny Raw ( “ known as Gennaro , through the defective pronunciation of his Italian friends — a British shopkeeper , who has left for awhile the countertenor of his way , and is travelling on the Continent for his pleasure ” ) . Miss Cecilia Ranoe was Alfonso , and a small part was played by Miss Nellie Moore . Lucrezia figures in this piece as a dabbler in monetary speculations , the failure of which gives opportunity for a speech parodying some Shakespearean lines with more freshness than such things usually possess :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Oh ! that dishonoured notes of hand would melt ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thaw , and dissolve themselves when overdue ,</l>
     <l n="3">And never leave the holder time to sue ;</l>
     <l n="4">Or that in pickle no such sharp rod lay</l>
     <l n="5">As the unpleasant writ called a ca sa !</l>
     <l n="6">How weary , flat , unprofitable , stale ,</l>
     <l n="7">To kick one 's heels inside a debtor 's gaol !</l>
     <l n="8">Fie o n't ! ‘ Tis an unweeded garden clearly ;</l>
     <l n="9">Blackguards and seedy swells possess it merely .</l>
     <l n="10">That it should come to this ! At two months ’ date !—</l>
     <l n="11">No , not two months ; six weeks is less than eight .</l>
     <l n="12">So excellent a bill ! The blow will floor me !</l>
     <l n="13">Is this a bailiff that I see before me ,</l>
     <l n="14">A capias in his hand ? Come , let me dodge thee ;</l>
     <l n="15">Or in a sponging-house I know thou'lt lodge me .</l>
     <l n="16">I 've turned my back , and yet I see thee still !</l>
     <l n="17">Canst thou then be two gentlemen at will ?</l>
     <l n="18">Or art thou but a grim dissolving view —</l>
     <l n="19">A phantom officer — in short , a do ?</l>
     <l n="20">I see thee yet — so palpable in form ,</l>
     <l n="21">My prospects seem uncomfortably warm .</l>
     <l n="22">Thou marshall'st me to Whitecross Street , I see ,</l>
     <l n="23">Clutching protested bills endorsed by me ;</l>
     <l n="24">Indictments , too , for fraud and false pretences !</l>
     <l n="25">Mine eyes are made the fools o ’ the other senses ,</l>
     <l n="26">Or else I 'm tight ! I see thee still , my man ;</l>
     <l n="27">And by thy side appears the prison van ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which was not so before . There 's no such thing !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the course of the piece , Johnny Raw is poisoned by Alfonso with publican 's port , and afterwards Lucrezia seeks to destroy Orsini and his companion with London milk . Byron 's burlesque on the subject was called “ Lucrezia Borgia , M. D . ”</p>
   <p>“ Linda di Chamouni ” exercised the wit both of Mr. Conway Edwardes and of Mr. Alfred Thompson . The former writer 's “ Linda di Chamouni , or the Blighted Flower , ” was played at Bath in 1869 ; the latter 's work was presented , later in the same year , at the Gaiety . In Mr. Edwardes ’ book one is most struck by the multiplicity and occasional felicity of the “ word-plays . ” Here , for instance , is what Pierotto says when he is asked to take a cup of wine :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Well , if you ask me what I 'll take , I think</l>
     <l n="2">Tea I prefer ‘ bove every other drink .</l>
     <l n="3">For when I 'm teazed , vex 'd , worried beyond measure ,</l>
     <l n="4">A cup of tea 's to me a source o ’ pleasure .</l>
     <l n="5">Whene'er I play , the game is tea-to-tum ;</l>
     <l n="6">My fav'rite instrument 's a “ kettledrum . ”</l>
     <l n="7">I 've faith , when suff'ring ills heir to humanity ,</l>
     <l n="8">In senna tea that you may say 's insanitee .</l>
     <l n="9">And also p'rhaps a little odd ‘ twill seem here ,</l>
     <l n="10">That I prefer the scenery of Bohea-mia .</l>
     <l n="11">And if I were engaged in deadly strife ,</l>
     <l n="12">I 'd stab my en'my with a Bohea knife .</l>

     <l n="13">Two of Donizetti 's operas — “ L'Elisir d'Amore ” and “ La Fille du</l>

     <l n="15">title of “ Doctor Dulcamara , or the Little Duck and the Great Quack , ”</l>
     <l n="16">the latter under that of “ La Vivandiere , or True to the Corps . ” “ Doctor</l>
     <l n="17">Dulcamara ” was played at the St. James 's , with Frank Matthews in the</l>
     <l n="18">title-part . “ La Vivandiere ” ( 1868 ) was written for the Queen 's Theatre ,</l>
     <l n="19">where it employed the talents of Miss Henrietta Hodson , Mr. Toole , Mr .</l>
     <l n="20">Lionel Brough , Miss Everard ( the original Little Buttercup ) , and Miss</l>

     <l n="22">Of Verdi 's operas two have been singled out for special attention — “ Il</l>

     <l n="24">“ Ill-Treated Trovatore , ” seen at the Adelphi in 1863 , and another</l>
     <l n="25">version by the same hand , played at the Olympic seventeen years after .</l>
     <l n="26">Byron also wrote a travestie of “ Ernani , ” which he called “ Handsome</l>
     <l n="27">Hernani ” ( Gaiety , 1879 ) ; but in this he had been anticipated by William</l>

     <l n="38">They walk at night — Molly is one .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Molly is the name here given to Amina ; Swelvino , of course , is Elvino . He is a sexton , and has plighted his troth to Lizzy ; but before the piece opens , he has transferred his affections to Molly Brown , a charity girl — “ a Greasy Roamer over the tops of houses . ” Swelvino and Molly are about to be married , when there arrives at the village Rodolpho , the new Inspector of Police , who introduces himself as follows :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ah , here I am again !— I know this scene ,</l>
     <l n="2">In which , when I was young , so oft I 've been .</l>
     <l n="3">I recognise each spot I see around ,</l>
     <l n="4">The stocks know me , and well I know the pound !</l>
     <l n="5">The sight of these my eyes with tears is filling :</l>
     <l n="6">I knew that pound when I had not a shilling !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Molly , walking in her sleep , enters Rodolpho 's apartment , and is found there by Swelvino , but is vindicated , like her prototype in the opera , by being subsequently discovered in a somnambulant condition . The story of “ La Sonnambula ” is , in fact , followed closely , but caricatured throughout . W. Rogers , who was the Swelvino , and Mitchell , who was the Molly , appear to have been highly successful in exciting the hilarity of their audiences . The latter portrayed the heroine as “ a waddling , thick-set , red-and-ruddy , blowzy-faced goblin , with turn-up nose and carroty hair , wrapt in a pea-soup or camomile-tea-coloured negligee , and carrying , ” in the sleep-walking scene , “ a farthing rushlight in one of Day &amp; Martin 's empty blacking-bottles . ” Of Swelvino 's appearance we may judge from a remark made by Molly to her lover :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I , by looking in your face , can tell</l>
     <l n="2">What are your feelings excellently well .</l>
     <l n="3">Oh , yes ! the fulness of that ruby nose</l>
     <l n="4">Your love for me doth passing well disclose ;</l>
     <l n="5">Your agitated whisker shows full well</l>
     <l n="6">What throbs of passion underneath it dwell !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The two other skits upon the opera were the work of H. J. Byron , who produced the first at the Prince of Wales 's in 1865 , under the title of “ La ! Sonnambula ! or the Supper , the Sleeper , and the Merry Swiss Boy ; being a passage in the life of a famous ‘ Woman in White ': a passage leading to a tip-top story . ” Miss Marie Wilton was the Merry Swiss Boy ( Alessio ) ; Miss Fanny Josephs was Elvino ; Mr. Dewar , Rodolpho ; “ Johnny ” Clarke , Amina ; Miss Bella Goodall , Lisa ; Mr. Harry Cox undertaking the role of “ a virtuous peasant ( by the kind permission of the Legitimate Drama ) . ” This was Miss Wilton 's first production at the Prince of Wales 's , and it was a great success . In 1878 Byron brought out at the Gaiety a piece which he called “ Il Sonnambulo , or Lively Little Alessio . ” In this he introduced several variations on the operatic story ; making the Count ( Edward Terry ) the somnambulist , instead of Amina — in burlesque of Mr. Henry Neville 's sleep-walking scene in Wilkie Collins 's “ Moonstone . ” Miss Farren was the lively little Alessio , and Mr. Royce the “ local tenor , ” Elvino .</p>
   <p>Of Bellini 's “ Norma ” the first burlesque produced was that which W. H. Oxberry , the comedian , contributed to the Haymarket in 1841 . In this the title-part was played by Paul Bedford , with Wright as Adalgisa and Mrs. H. P. Grattan as Pollio . The piece had no literary pretensions , and it would be unfair to compare it , in that or any other respect , with “ The Pretty Druidess , or the Mother , the Maid , and the Mistletoe Bough , ” which Mr. W. S. Gilbert wrote for the Charing Cross Theatre ( now Toole 's ) just twenty-eight years later . This was one of the best of Mr. Gilbert 's operatic travesties , the dialogue being characterised by especial point and neatness . Here , for example , is the advice given by Norma ( Miss Hughes ) to the ladies presiding over the stalls at a fancy fair . Hamlet 's address to the players is very happily suggested :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">With pretty speech accost both old and young ,</l>
     <l n="2">And speak it trippingly upon the tongue ;</l>
     <l n="3">But if you mouth it with a hoyden laugh ,</l>
     <l n="4">With clumsy ogling and uncomely chaff —</l>
     <l n="5">As I have oft seen done at fancy fairs ,</l>
     <l n="6">I had as lief a huckster sold my wares .</l>
     <l n="7">Avoid all so-called beautifying , dear .</l>
     <l n="8">Oh ! it offends me to the soul to hear</l>
     <l n="9">The things that men among themselves will say</l>
     <l n="10">Of some soi-disant “ beauty of the day , ”</l>
     <l n="11">Whose face , when with cosmetics she has cloyed it ,</l>
     <l n="12">Out-Rachels Rachel !— pray you , girls , avoid it .</l>
     <l n="13">Neither be ye too tame — but , ere you go ,</l>
     <l n="14">Provide yourselves with sprigs of mistletoe ;</l>
     <l n="15">Offer them coyly to the Roman herd —</l>
     <l n="16">But do n't you “ suit the action to the word , ”</l>
     <l n="17">For in the very torrent of your passion</l>
     <l n="18">Remember modesty is still in fashion .</l>
     <l n="19">Oh , there be ladies whom I 've seen hold stalls —</l>
     <l n="20">Ladies of rank , my dear — to whom befalls</l>
     <l n="21">Neither the accent nor the gait of ladies ;</l>
     <l n="22">So clumsily made up with Bloom of Cadiz ,</l>
     <l n="23">Powder-rouge — lip-salve — that I 've fancied then</l>
     <l n="24">They were the work of Nature 's journeymen .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The “ Gazza Ladra ” of Rossini lives on the burlesque stage in the counterfeit presentment furnished by Byron 's “ Maid and the Magpie , or the Fatal Spoon . ” This was one of the writer 's greatest triumphs in the field of travestie . Produced at the Strand in 1854 , with Miss Oliver as Ninette , Miss Marie Wilton as Pippo , Bland as Fernando , and Clarke as Isaac ( the old-clothes man ) , it at once hit the public taste , as it well deserved to do , for it is full of clever writing and ingenious incidents . The best scene of all , perhaps , is that in which the broken-down Fernando reveals himself to Ninette — a happy satire upon a familiar melodramatic situation :—</p>
   <p>Ninette ( entering ) . A stranger here !</p>
   <p>Fernan . How beautiful she 's grown ! I say , my dear ! ( she starts ) Start not — ha , ha !— do I alarm you ?</p>
   <p>Ninette ( uneasily ) . Rather !</p>
   <p>Fernan ( hesitatingly ) . Why , miss , you see — the fact is — I 'm your father !</p>
   <p>Ninette . Impossible ! I never had one !</p>
   <p>Fernan . Law !</p>
   <p>Ninette . That is — I had none that I ever saw .</p>
   <p>Fernan . Oh , why in battle did no friendly blow Finish her luckless parent long ago ? ( in choked accents ) Doth not the voice of nature seem quite clear — eh ?</p>
   <p>Ninette . The voice of nature seems a little beery .</p>
   <p>Fernan ( seizing her arm — music piano ) . Look at me well !</p>
   <p>( Ninette appears gradually to recognise him . )</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Ninette . Upon a close inspection ,</l>
     <l n="2">I seem to have a dreamy recollection</l>

     <l n="4">Also that most extensive head of hair ;</l>
     <l n="5">The accents of the voice , too , now I think ,</l>
     <l n="6">Seem broken by emotion , not by drink ;</l>

     <l n="37">Come , dwell with me , my beautiful — my own .</l>

   <p>Turning to the burlesques of opera of the German school , we begin , naturally , with Mozart , whose “ Don Giovanni ” found humorous reflection in two pieces , by H. J. Byron and Mr. Reece . The former 's “ Little Don Giovanni "[ 45 ] belongs to 1865 , when it was performed at the Prince of Wales 's , with Miss Wilton ( Mrs. Bancroft ) as the hero , Clarke as Leporello , Miss Fanny Josephs as Masetto , Mr. Hare as Zerlina ( probably his only appearance on the stage in petticoats ) , Miss Sophie Larkin as Elvira , and Miss Hughes as Donna Anna . Don Giovanni was the last burlesque part written by Byron for Miss Wilton , and , moreover , it was the last burlesque part she ever played . She records in her Memoirs that an amusing feature of the piece was the spectacle presented in the last act by the Commandant 's horse , which , in allusion to a recent freak in Leicester Square , had been covered with a variety of spots , and “ looked like an exaggerated Lowther Arcade toy . ” Mr. Reece 's burlesque was called “ Don Giovanni in Venice , ” and came out at the Gaiety in 1873 .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>Byron 's “ Don Juan , ” brought out at the Alhambra in 1873 , was about equally indebted for its plot to the libretto of Mozart 's opera and to Lord Byron 's poem .</p>
   <p>In 1842 Macready revived at Drury Lane Handel 's delightful “ Acis and Galatea , ” and the opera was promptly caricatured by W. H. Oxberry in a piece produced three days afterwards at the Adelphi . The travestie of “ Acis and Galatea ” which was seen at the Olympic in 1863 was from the pen of Mr. Burnand . Its full title was “ Acis and Galatea , or the Nimble Nymph and the Terrible Troglodyte ” ; and the Nimble Nymph ( described as “ a Nymph of the Sea , who also visits the land — a nymphibious young lady ” ) was played by Miss Hughes . The puns were prolific , and so were the parodies , the best of which are written in caricature of the absurd English translations in the operatic “ books of the play . ” Here , for example , is a setting of the trio in “ Trovatore ” — “ Il tuo sangue ":—</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>This , says Mr. Burnand in a note , is the poetic for “ You 'll get on your bonnet and accompany Polyphemus . ”</p>
   <p>Six years after the production of Mr. Burnand 's piece , Mr. T. F. Plowman brought out at Oxford “ a piece of extravagance , ” to which he gave the name of “ A Very New Edition of Acis and Galatea , or the Beau ! the Belle ! and the Blacksmith ! ”</p>
   <p>Of Meyerbeer 's operas three have been burlesqued in England — “ Dinorah , ” “ L'Africaine ” and “ Robert le Diable . ” The first of these was parodied in “ Dinorah under Difficulties , ” a burlesque by William Brough , which dates back as far as 1859 ( at the Adelphi ) . “ L'Africaine ” was handled by Mr. Burnand six years later at the Strand . Three years more , and “ Robert le Diable ” was being travestied at the Gaiety by Mr. Gilbert , under the title of “ Robert the Devil , or the Nun , the Dun , and the Sun of a Gun . "[ 47 ] This last is on the old lines of “ palmy-day ” burlesque , and has not much in it that is characteristically Gilbertian . The lyrics are written chiefly to operatic airs , and there is no room , therefore , for rhythmical invention . In the dialogue , however , one comes across an occasional passage which strikes one as quite Gilbertian in its cynicism . Take , for example , these lines from the scene in which fun is made of the Tussaud “ Chamber of Horrors ":—</p>

   <p>Weber 's “ Der Freischutz ” has been travestied both by Mr. Burnand and by H. J. Byron , both productions taking place in 1866 , within two days of each other — the one at the Strand , and the other at the Prince of Wales 's . Mr. Reece is responsible for a burlesque of Flotow 's “ Martha , ” performed at the Gaiety in 1873 , with Miss Constance Loseby , Miss Rachel Sanger , Mr. Lionel Brough , and Mr. Aynsley Cook in the leading parts .</p>
   <p>Wagnerian “ music-drama ” has more than once been desecrated on the burlesque stage . First of all there came , at the Royalty in 1869 , the “ Flying Dutchman ” of William Brough ; then Messrs. Green and Swanborough brought out at the Strand , in 1876 , “ The Flying Dutchman ” ( with M. Marius and Miss Lottie Venne ) ; and the “ Little Lohengrin ” of Mr. Bowyer saw the light in 1884 at the Holborn Theatre .</p>
   <p>So much for the German school . Of the French composers , Auber has had more pieces travestied in this country than has any one of his fellows . There is “ Masaniello , ” for instance , and “ Fra Diavolo , ” and “ Les Diamans de la Couronne . ” “ Masaniello , or the Fish ‘ oman of Naples , ” was the title given by Robert B. Brough to the “ fish tale , in one act , ” which he wrote for the Olympic in 1857 . He had , for the impersonator of his hero , Robson , whose presence in the cast suggested to Mrs. Wigan the addition to the mad scene of sundry indications of the actor 's former successes at the Olympic . The result was very successful . Masaniello came on , crying —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">My lord , the Earl of Hammersmith is taken !</l>
     <l n="2">Stop ! That 's in Hamlet ! I 'm Masaniello !</l>
     <l n="3">To be or not to was — that 's in Othello ,</l>
     <l n="4">Translated into Irish — for Ristori .</l>
     <l n="5">Pop goes the Weasel — that 's from Trovatore .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He then breaks off into a portion of the dagger dance from “ Macbeth Travestie , ” following this up with a scrap from Italian opera and part of the hornpipe in “ The Yellow Dwarf . ” Then Borella says :—</p>
   <p>You are our chief ! Do you not know me , sir ?</p>
   <p>Mas . Excellent well ! You are a fishmonger ! And I 'm your chieftain .</p>

   <p>After this , Robson was wont to introduce a bit of “ business ” from “ The Discreet Princess , ” ending with a ditty from the “ Medea ” burlesque . The travestie of the pantomime-action of the dumb girl Fenella was naturally another feature of Brough 's work , which had the usual supply of puns , and , altogether , more than the usual amount of literary and dramatic merit . The little travestie , called “ Masse-en-Yell-Oh , ” written by Messrs. Harry Paulton and Mostyn Tedde for the Comedy in 1886 , was an unpretending piece of work , not challenging comparison with its predecessor .</p>
   <p>Auber 's “ Fra Diavolo ” was another of the operatic originals on which H. J. Byron based his comic fancies . He wrote , to begin with , “ Fra Diavolo , or the Beauty and the Brigands , ” first seen at the Strand in 1858 ; and then , twenty years after , “ Young Fra Diavolo , ” which made its appearance at the Gaiety . “ Les Diamans de la Couronne ” fell to the lot of Mr. Reece , who , in 1875 , prepared for the Holborn Theatre the piece entitled “ The Half-crown Diamonds , ” a revised edition of which found its way to the stage of the Imperial Theatre just five years later .</p>

     <l n="1">Herold 's “ Zampa ” was burlesqued by Mr. T. F. Plowman at the Court in</l>
     <l n="2">1872 , and by Mr. J. McArdle for the provincial stage in 1876 . The</l>
     <l n="3">“ Mignon ” of M. Thomas has also been transmogrified into the “ Merry</l>
     <l n="4">Mignon ” of Mr. Wilton Jones ( 1882 ) . The “ Carmen ” of Georges Bizet has</l>
     <l n="5">had its mirthful side portrayed in no fewer than four comic pieces — the</l>
     <l n="6">“ Carmen , or Sold for a Song ” of Mr. Reece ( Folly , 1879 ) ; the “ Cruel</l>
     <l n="7">Carmen ” of Mr. Wilton Jones ( 1880 ) ; the “ Little Carmen ” of Mr. Alfred</l>
     <l n="8">Murray ( Globe , 1884 ) ; and the “ Carmen Up to Data ” of Messrs. Sims and</l>
     <l n="9">Pettitt ( Gaiety , 1890 ) . The Carmen of the first of these productions</l>
     <l n="10">was Miss Lydia Thompson ,— of the last , Miss Florence St. John , a</l>
     <l n="11">charming vocalist , gifted with the true vis comica .</l>

   <p>But the most popular , by a long way , of all French operas , for purposes of burlesque , has been the “ Faust ” of Gounod . Of the many travesties of this , or of the story embodied in it , the earliest was that of Halford , brought out at the Olympic in 1854 . This was followed in 1857 by a piece called “ Alonzo the Brave , ” written by Mr. Burnand for performance by University amateurs at Cambridge , and mingling the story of Alonzo , as told in the ballad , with that of Faust , in a fashion effective , if a little puzzling . In this piece of extravagance ( in which , by the way , Mr. Burnand played Mephistopheles ) , Imogene is the heroine , taking the place of Marguerite in the affections of Faust . For a while , in the absence of Alonzo , she yields to the snares of the tempter ; but , in the end , her first sweetheart appears to her as his own ghost , her inconstancy is forgiven , and Faust retires from the scene .</p>

     <l n="1">Seven years later Mr. Burnand wrote a burlesque called “ Faust and</l>
     <l n="2">Marguerite ” for the St. James 's . He had Ashley for his Faust , Charles</l>
     <l n="3">Mathews and Mrs. Charles Mathews for his Mephistopheles and Marguerite ,</l>
     <l n="4">H. J. Montague for his Valentine , and “ Johnny ” Clarke for his Martha .</l>
     <l n="5">In this instance he followed the story of the opera pretty closely till</l>
     <l n="6">near the end , when Faust was sued for breach of promise of marriage ,</l>
     <l n="7">and escaped the clutches of Mephistopheles only by consenting to pair</l>
     <l n="8">off with Martha ! A visit to a music-hall formed part of the action , and</l>
     <l n="9">gave occasion for some pointed lines . Said Faust :—</l>

     <l n="35">In 1869 Mr. Burnand was to the fore again with “ Very Little Faust</l>
     <l n="36">and More Marguerite , ” which was played at the Charing Cross Theatre</l>
     <l n="37">( as the building was then called ) . A few years later — in 1877 — H. J .</l>
     <l n="38">Byron entered the field with “ Little Doctor Faust , ” in which he had</l>
     <l n="39">for interpreters the Gaiety artists , headed by Miss Farren and Mr .</l>
     <l n="40">Edward Terry . Later still — in 1885 — came a provincial writer with</l>
     <l n="41">“ Faust in Forty Minutes . ” In 1886 we had at the Royalty a piece called</l>
     <l n="42">“ Mephisto , ” of which the only characteristic feature was an imitation</l>
     <l n="43">of Mr. Irving by Mr. E. J. Henley , clever in its way , but not to be</l>
     <l n="44">compared for sustained truthfulness to the performance given by Mr .</l>
     <l n="45">H. E. Dixey in “ Adonis ” ( at the Gaiety ) a week or two previously .</l>
     <l n="46">In 1886 , also , Mr. Burnand brought out at Toole 's — with Mr. Toole as</l>
     <l n="47">Mephistopheles ( a la Irving ) — “ Faust and Loose ” ; and , two years</l>

   <p>English serious opera has not often fallen a prey to the untender mercies of the parodist . Balfe and Vincent Wallace alone have been victimised in that way — Balfe through his “ Bohemian Girl ” and “ Rose of Castile ” ; Wallace through his “ Maritana . ” The “ Bohemian Girl ” has taken four different shapes on the burlesque boards . In 1851 , as transmogrified by the Brothers Brough , she figured at the Haymarket as “ Arline . ” In 1864 , under the auspices of Messrs. Best and Bellingham , she appeared at Sadler 's Wells under the same designation . At the command of Mr. W. S. Gilbert she posed at the Royalty in 1868 as “ The Merry Zingara . ” In 1877 , as portrayed by H. J. Byron at the Opera Comique and Gaiety , she appeared as “ The Bohemian Gy-url . ” For his Arline Mr. Gilbert had Miss “ Patty ” Oliver ; for his Gipsy Queen , Miss Charlotte Saunders ; for his Count Arnheim , Fred Dewar ; and for his Devilshoof , Danvers . Byron 's piece was interpreted by the Gaiety Company . “ The Rose of Castile , ” as treated by Mr. Conway Edwardes , was seen in 1872 at the Brighton Theatre as “ The Rows of Castile . ” “ Maritana , ” of course , was the origin and basis of Mr. Burnand 's “ Mary Turner ” ( Holborn Theatre , 1867 ) , as well as of Byron 's “ Little Don Caesar de Bazan ” ( Gaiety , 1876 ) , in which Mr. Terry was such an entertaining King Charles .</p>
   <p>IX .</p>
   <p>BURLESQUE OF FICTION AND SONG .</p>
   <p>The writers of stage travestie have gone less to fiction for subject-matter than might have been expected . Half a dozen romances previous to Scott , half a dozen of Scott 's own stories , about the same number of modern novels , and still fewer foreign masterpieces — these represent the sources of all the most important of the burlesques which have been based upon invented prose narrative .</p>
   <p>The earliest of the tales which have been thus dealt with is “ Robinson Crusoe . ” Of this time-honoured story , the first whimsical treatment was that which took the shape of a piece called “ Crusoe the Second , or the Shipwrecked Milliners , ” presented at the Lyceum in 1847 . This was written by Stocqueler , and had for interpreters Mr. and Mrs. Keeley , with Alfred Wigan ( as Crusoe ) . It was followed , in 1860 , at the Princess 's , by the “ Robinson Crusoe ” of H. J. Byron . Seven years later , no fewer than six writers joined in the production of a perversion of Defoe 's tale , brought out at the Haymarket in 1867 , and bearing the names of H. J. Byron , W. S. Gilbert , T. Hood , jun ., H. S. Leigh , W. J. Prowse , and Arthur Sketchley . In this ( which was given at a matinee for the benefit of the family of Paul Gray , the artist ) the parts were all sustained by well-known men of art and letters . After this there came , in 1876 , at the Folly , the “ Robinson Crusoe ” of Mr. H. B. Farnie ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span>which , in its turn , was followed , just ten years later , by yet another arrangement of the story , in which Mr. Farnie had the co-operation of Mr. Reece .</p>

     <l n="3">To the Adelphi , in 1846 , belongs an “ extra extravagant extravaganza , ”</l>
     <l n="4">founded by Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett and Mark Lemon on the “ Peter</l>
     <l n="5">Wilkins ” of Robert Paltock ( first printed in 1750 ) . This burlesque</l>
     <l n="6">had for its full title — “ Peter Wilkins , or the Loadstone Rock and the</l>
     <l n="7">Flying Indians , ” and had for its chief interpreters — Miss Woolgar as</l>
     <l n="8">the hero , Paul Bedford as Jack Adams , and Miss E. Chaplin as Youriwkee .</l>
     <l n="9">Dr. Johnson 's “ Rasselas ” attracted the attention of William Brough ,</l>
     <l n="10">and was made , in 1862 , the foundation of a burlesque produced at the</l>
     <l n="11">Haymarket .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In 1765 Horace Walpole published his mediaeval imagining , “ The Castle of Otranto , ” by which so many of us have in our youth been thrilled . In 1848 Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett set himself to make fun of its singularities , and the result was a very brightly written piece , enacted at the Haymarket .<span type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span>In this , Manfred 's son Conrad is found imprisoned under the gigantic helmet of Alphonso , and the distracted father at once begins to give way to comic word-splitting :—</p>

     <l n="7">No one would dare my Conrad thus to bonnet .</l>
     <l n="8">But stay !— has anybody got a lever ,</l>
     <l n="9">To give a lift to this gigantic beaver ?</l>
     <l n="10">( The helmet is raised at the back ; Manfred looks under it . )</l>
     <l n="11">Alas ! he speaks the truth — my son lies low ,</l>

     <l n="13">My . Conrad gone !— This is a sad disaster ,</l>

     <l n="18">My boy , crush 'd ‘ neath this hated nap , has napped it !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the opening scene , Hippolita , Conrad 's mother , ventures to suggest to Manfred that the boy is not of marriageable age , sixteen summers not having yet passed o'er his head :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="6">The boy 's as downy as a boy need be .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the year following the publication of “ The Castle of Otranto , ” the “ Vicar of Wakefield ” was given to the world . It appears to have escaped travestie until 1885 , when — thinking more , no doubt , of Mr. Wills 's “ Olivia ” than of Goldsmith 's chef d'oeuvre — Messrs. Stephens and Yardley brought out at the Gaiety “ The Vicar of Wideawakefield , ” in which Mr. Arthur Roberts and Miss Laura Linden sought , not unsuccessfully , to reproduce and heighten some of the artistic peculiarities of Mr. Irving and Miss Ellen Terry . Mrs. Shelley 's “ Frankenstein , ” published in 1818 , received its first dramatic reductio ad absurdum in 1849 , when the Brothers Brough made it the subject of a burlesque ;— its second in 1887 , when Messrs. “ Richard Henry ” turned out at the Gaiety a travestie , of which I shall have something to say in my next chapter . In the Broughs ’ version Wright was Frankenstein and Paul Bedford the Monster , and much fun was made out of the finishing touches which Frankenstein gave to his work . “ O . ” Smith , Miss Woolgar , and Miss Chaplin were also in the cast .</p>
   <p>Sir Walter Scott 's novels have obtained a fair amount of notice from the comic dramatists . “ Ivanhoe , ” for example , has exercised the humorous powers of three — of Robert Brough ( at the Haymarket in 1850 ) , of H. J. Byron ( at the Strand in 1862 ) , and of T. F. Plowman ( at the Court in 1871 ) . Byron ( who called his work “ Ivanhoe in accordance with the Spirit of the Times "[ 50 ]) had the aid of Miss Charlotte Saunders as his Wilfred , of Charles Rice as his Brian de Bois-Guilbert , of “ Johnny ” Clarke as his Isaac of York , of Miss Eleanor Bufton as his Black Knight , of Miss Swanborough as Rowena , of Jenny Rogers as his Rebecca , and of Miss Polly Marshall , Miss Fanny Hughes , and Poynter in other parts . In the provinces he was his own Isaac of York .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>This burlesque has been used , during the present year , as the</l>
     <l n="2">foundation for a travestie played by the Cambridge Amateur Dramatic</l>
     <l n="3">Company , under the title of “ Ivanhoe a la Carte ” ( in allusion to Mr .</l>
     <l n="4">D'Oyly Carte 's production of Sir Arthur Sullivan 's “ Ivanhoe ” ) . To this</l>

   <p>“ Isaac of York , ” by the way , was the title given by Mr. Plowman to his effort , which had a good deal of ingenuity and “ go . ” Here , for example , is an extract from the scene at the banquet at which Cedric entertains his guests .

     <l n="2">Mr. Sydney French took it in hand at the Marylebone in 1867 , and Mr .</l>
     <l n="3">William Lowe gave it a very Scotch rendering , in 1880 , under the title</l>
     <l n="4">of “ Mr. Robert Roye , Hielan Helen his Wife , and Dougal the Dodger . ” But</l>
     <l n="5">the “ standard ” burlesque on the subject is , of course , Mr. Burnand 's</l>
     <l n="6">“ Robbing Roy ” ( Gaiety , 1879 ) , in which Mr. Terry was such a diverting</l>
     <l n="7">“ Roy , ” with Miss Farren as Francis , Miss Vaughan as Diana , and Mr .</l>
     <l n="8">Royce as an admirable Dougal . Of the “ Bride of Lammermoor ” there have</l>
     <l n="9">been two burlesque versions — Oxberry 's , at the Strand in 1848 ; and H .</l>
     <l n="10">J. Byron 's , at the Prince of Wales 's in 1865 . “ Kenilworth ” has been</l>
     <l n="11">similarly honoured . There was the piece brought out at the Strand in</l>
     <l n="12">1858 by Andrew Halliday and a collaborator , and there was that which</l>
     <l n="13">Messrs. Reece and Farnie contributed to the Avenue Theatre in 1885 .</l>
     <l n="14">“ Guy Mannering ” has engaged the attention of Mr. Burnand : we can all</l>
     <l n="15">remember his “ Here 's another Guy Mannering , ” brought out at the</l>
     <l n="16">Vaudeville in 1874 . For the solitary travestie of “ The Talisman , ” the</l>
     <l n="17">late J. F. M'Ardle is responsible . It was first played at Liverpool in</l>
     <l n="18">the year last named .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Lord Lytton 's novels and romances have been ridiculed on the stage very much less frequently than have his dramas . “ The Very Last Days of Pompeii , ” by Mr. Reece , and “ The Last of the Barons , ” by Mr. Du Terreaux , are , so far as I know , the only stage works in which his prose fiction has been perverted . The former was seen at the Vaudeville in 1872 , and the latter at the Strand in the same year . In “ The Last of the Barons , ” Atkins was the Kingmaker , Mr. Edward Terry portraying Edward IV . as a great dandy , and endowing him with an amusing lisp .</p>
   <p>When we turn to the stories of more recent times , we think at once of the “ No Thoroughfare ” of Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins , and of the “ Foul Play ” of Charles Reade and Dion Boucicault , as having suffered at the hands of the irreverent scribes . The former romance suggested to Hazlewood junior his “ No Thorough-fair beyond Highbury , or the Maid , the Mother , and the Malicious Mountaineer . ” This was in 1868 ; and in the following year the elder George Grossmith emulated Hazlewood 's example at the Victoria Theatre . “ Foul Play ” was parodied by Mr. Burnand , not only in the pages of Punch , but in “ Fowl Play , or a Story of Chikkin Hazard , ” produced at the New Queers in 1868 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 52 ]</span>Of the bright writing in this “ book , ” no better specimen could well be furnished than the song which Wylie sings in description of the scuttling of the Proserpine .

   <p>Among other recent fictions which have obtained the distinction of stage travestie may be named “ Lady Audley 's Secret , ” “ Little Lord Fauntleroy , ” and “ The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . ” In the first of these instances H. J. Byron was the operator — the scene , the St. James 's Theatre in 1863 . Mrs. Burnett 's pretty conception was tortured into “ The Other Little Lord Fondleboy ” ( 1888 ) , and Mr. Stevenson 's weird invention into “ The Real Case of Hide and Seekyll ” ( Royalty , 1888 ) , for which the younger George Grossmith must bear the blame .</p>

     <l n="1">The literature of dramatic parody does not owe much to foreign fiction .</l>
     <l n="2">Farnie gave us “ Little Gil Bias ” at the Princess 's in 1870 , and in the</l>

     <l n="5">Paulton turned out , at Liverpool , “ The Gay Musketeers , ” which was</l>
     <l n="6">followed at the Strand in 1871 by “ The Three Musket-Dears ” of Messrs .</l>
     <l n="7">J. and H. Paulton . Of the “ Monte Cristo Junior ” of Messrs. “ Richard</l>
     <l n="8">Henry ” I shall have something to say anon .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dividing Song for the moment into Poem and Ballad , we note that the poems of Lord Byron have been the inspiring cause of at least four notable burlesques . His lordship 's “ Don Juan ” suggested the “ Beautiful Haidee ” of H. J. Byron ( 1863 ) and the “ Don Juan Junior ” of the “ Brothers Prendergast ” ( 1880 ) ; while his “ Corsair ” is the basis of William Brough 's “ Conrad and Medora ” ( Lyceum , 1856 ) , and his “ Bride of Abydos ” prompted the piece with the same title which H. J. Byron wrote for the Strand Theatre . In “ Conrad and Medora ” Miss Marie Wilton was “ the Little Fairy at the Bottom of the Sea , ” the title-parts being given to Miss Woolgar and Mrs. Charles Dillon , and that of Birbanto to Mr. Toole . The Bride of Abydos — Zuleika — had Miss Oliver for her representative .</p>

     <l n="1">With Byron it seems natural to associate his friend Tom Moore , whose</l>
     <l n="2">“ Lalla Rookh ” has had exceptional favour with the parodists . Four of</l>

     <l n="4">Mr. Horace Lennard in the previous year , Vincent Amcotts in 1866 , and</l>
     <l n="5">last , but not least , William Brough ( at the Lyceum ) in 1857 . It was to</l>

   <p>In this piece Mrs. Charles Dillon was the Lalla Rookh , and Mr. Toole represented “ a fabulous personage , not found in the poem , ” called Khorsanbad .</p>
   <p>One , at least , of our burlesque writers — Mr. Gilbert Arthur a'Beckett — has had the courage to tackle a poem of Coleridge ; to wit , his “ Christabel , ” from which , however , Mr. A'Beckett derived only certain suggestions for his work . In his “ Christabel , or the Bard Bewitched , ” represented at the Court in 1872 , the Bard , Bracy , was played by Mr. Righton , who made a special feature of a travestie of Mr. Irving in “ The Bells . ” He pretended that he had murdered a muffin-man , and that , consuming all he could of the muffins left in the man 's basket , he had deposited the remainder in the area . Miss Nelly Bromley was the Christabel .</p>
   <p>Scott 's “ Lady of the Lake ” gave Mr. Reece the idea for a burlesque performed at the Royalty in 1866 . In the same year Andrew Halliday brought out at the Adelphi a comic piece , happily entitled “ The Mountain Dhu , or the Knight , the Lady , and the Lake . ” Mr. Toole was the impersonator of the Mountain Dhu , Paul Bedford the Douglas , Miss Hughes the Malcolm Graeme , Miss Woolgar ( Mrs. Mellon ) the Fitzjames , and Miss Furtado the Lady of the Lake . “ The Lady of the Lane ” was the title given by H. J. Byron to the travestie from his pen which saw the light at the Strand in 1872 . In this case Mr. Edward Terry was the Roderick and Miss Kate Bishop the Ellen , Mrs. Raymond making a great hit as the demented Blanche .</p>
   <p>Our present Laureate provoked in 1870 the satiric powers of Mr. W. S. Gilbert , whose “ Princess , ” played at the Olympic , was described by the author as “ a whimsical allegory , ” as well as “ a respectful perversion of Mr. Tennyson 's poem . "[ 54 ] In this production Mr. Gilbert wrote his lyrics to the melodies of popular airs , after the manner of the time . The major portion of the travestie is familiar to present-day audiences as having formed , in the main , the text of “ Princess Ida , ” for which Sir Arthur Sullivan composed such charming music . Nevertheless , I cannot refrain from quoting , as a happy specimen of Mr. Gilbert 's later manner in burlesque ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 55 ]</span>the speech addressed by the Princess to her disciples — a speech marked by agreeable naivete and happy mock-heroics :—</p>

   <p>Into the region of the Ballad the comic playwrights have made comparatively few incursions . “ The Babes in the Wood , ” “ Lord Bateman , ” “ Billy Taylor , ” “ Villikins and his Dinah , ” and “ Lord Lovel , ” — these are the stories which have been most in favour with burlesque purveyors . R. J. Byron took up the first-named subject in 1859 , when the company at the Adelphi ( where the piece was produced ) included Miss Woolgar ( Sir Rowland Macassar ) , Mr. Toole and Miss Kate Kelly ( the Babes ) , Paul Bedford ( the First Ruffian ) , and Mrs. Billington ( the Lady Macassar ) . Then , in 1877 , there came a provincial version by Messrs. G. L. Gordon and G. W. Anson ; and , next , in 1884 , at Toole 's Theatre , the “ Babes ” of Mr. Harry Paulton , in which Mr. Edouin and Miss Atherton were the central figures . The first travestie of “ Lord Bateman ” was made by Charles Selby at the Strand in 1839 ; then there was the production by R. B. Brough in 1854 at the Adelphi ; and , still later , there was the piece by H. J. Byron , at the Globe ( 1869 ) . Passing over the “ Billy Taylor ” of Buckstone ( 1829 ) , we arrive at “ The Military Billy Taylor ” of Mr. Burnand , which came out forty years later . It is to Mr. Burnand , also , that we owe “ Villikins and his Dinah , ” played by amateurs at Cambridge , as well as “ Lord Lovel and the Lady Nancy Bell , ” which he wrote for the same place and performers .</p>
   <p>X .</p>
   <p>THE NEW BURLESQUE .</p>
   <p>With the year 1885 there dawned a new epoch for stage travestie in England . The old Gaiety company had broken up , Miss Farren alone remaining ; and with the accession of fresh blood there came fresh methods . The manager who had succeeded Mr. Hollingshead recognised the tendencies of the times ; and with “ Little Jack Sheppard ” — a travestie by Messrs. Stephens and Yardley of the well-known story , familiar both in fiction and in drama — a novel departure was made .</p>
   <p>In the “ palmy ” days , burlesque had not , as a rule , formed the whole of an evening 's entertainment . The one-act travestie had grown on occasion into two and even three acts ; but , until recent years , the one act ( in several scenes ) had usually been deemed sufficient , the remainder of the programme being devoted to comedy or drama . The musical part of the performance had generally been made up of adaptations or reproductions of popular airs of the day — either comic songs or operatic melodies : very rarely had the music been special and original . The scenery had never been particularly remarkable ; nor , save during the various regimes of Vestris , had there been any special splendour in the dresses . For the most part , the old school of burlesque did not rely upon a brilliant mise-en-scene . In the prologue to his “ Alcestis , ” produced just forty-one years ago , we find Talfourd expressly drawing attention to the simplicity of the stage show . Speaking of the productions at the houses of serious drama , he said :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Plays of the greatest and the least pretence</l>
     <l n="2">Are mounted so regardless of expense</l>
     <l n="3">That fifty nights is scarce a run accounted —</l>
     <l n="4">Run ! They should gallop , being so well mounted</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">But with “ Alcestis ” it was to be different :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">What you enjoy must be all “ on the quiet . ”</l>
     <l n="7">No horse will pull our play up if it drag ,</l>
     <l n="8">No banners when our wit is on the flag ;</l>
     <l n="9">No great effects or new-imported dance</l>
     <l n="10">The drooping eye will waken and entrance ; ...</l>
     <l n="11">But an old story from a classic clime ,</l>
     <l n="12">Done for the period into modern rhyme .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A very different policy was to characterise the New Burlesque . The pieces , having now become the staple of the night 's amusement , were to be placed upon the boards with all possible splendour . Money was to be spent lavishly on scenery , properties and costumes . Dancing was to be a prominent feature — not the good old-fashioned “ breakdowns ” and the like , but choreographic interludes of real grace and ingenuity . The music was to be written specially for the productions , and pains were to be taken to secure artists who could really sing . Something had already been done in each of these directions . So long ago as 1865 Mr. Burnand 's “ Windsor Forest ” had been fitted with wholly new music ; and at the Gaiety , under Mr. Hollingshead , burlesque had grown in elaborateness year by year . Not , however , till the production of “ Little Jack Sheppard , ” in 1885 , had the elaboration been so marked and complete in all departments .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , how were the librettists to be affected ? Clearly , they would have to give more opportunities than usual for musical and saltatory illustration ; and accordingly we find the book of “ Little Jack Sheppard ” full of lyrics — solos , duets , quartets and choruses , all of them set to new airs by competent composers . At the same time , the authors took care not to omit the element of punning dialogue . In this respect the old traditions were to be maintained . Byron , for instance , might very well have written the lines which follow , in which the interlocutors strive to outdo one another in the recklessness of their jeux de mots :—</p>

   <p>“ Little Jack Sheppard ” — which had for its chief exponents Miss Farren , Mr. Fred Leslie ( a brilliant recruit from the comic opera stage ) , Mr. David James ( who had returned for a time to his old love ) , Mr. Odell , Miss Harriet Coveney , and Miss Marion Hood ( who had graduated in Gilbert-Sullivan opera ) — was followed at the Gaiety by “ Monte Cristo Junior , ” in which Messrs. “ Richard Henry ” presented a bright and vivacious travestie of Dumas ’ famous fiction , greatly aided by the chic of Miss Farren as the hero , and the inexhaustible humorous resource of Mr. Leslie as Noirtier . Here , for example , is a bit of the scene between these two characters in the Chateau d'If :—</p>

   <p>After “ Monte Cristo Junior ” there came , at the same theatre and from the pens of the same writers , a travestie of “ Frankenstein , ” produced in 1887 , with Miss Farren as the hero , and Mr. Leslie as the Monster that he fashions . Here much ingenuity was shown in the management of the pseudo-supernatural business connected with the Monster . Previous to the vivifying of the figure , Frankenstein thus soliloquised :—</p>

   <p>In 1888 Mr. G. R. Sims and Mr. Henry Pettitt joined forces in burlesque , and the result was seen in a piece happily entitled “ Faust up to Date . ” In this version Marguerite ( Miss Florence St. John ) figures first as a barmaid at an Exhibition . She is a young lady of some astuteness , though she insists upon her general ingenuousness :—</p>
   <lg>

   <p>At the end , when Mephistopheles ( Mr. E. J. Lonnen ) comes to claim Faust , it turns out that Faust and Marguerite have been duly married , but have been obliged to conceal the fact because Marguerite was a ward in Chancery . Moreover , Old Faust reappears , and insists that , as it was he who signed the bond , it is he and not young Faust who ought to suffer for it .</p>
   <p>“ Faust up to Date ” includes some clever songs and some excruciating puns , of which these are perhaps the most excruciating :—</p>
   <p>Marg . These sapphires are the finest I have seen .</p>
   <p>Faust . Ah ! what I 've sapphired for your sake , my queen !</p>

   <p>“ Atalanta , ” the travestie by Mr. G. P. Hawtrey brought out at the Strand in 1888 , was fitted with prose dialogue , much of which was very smart and amusing . The songs were numerous and well-turned , and certain details of the travestie were ingenious . Hippomenes , the hero , wins the race he runs with Atalanta , by placing in her path a brand-new “ costume , ” of modern cut and material , which she finds it impossible not to stop for . For the rest , while possessing a decidedly “ classical ” flavour , “ Atalanta ” was , in essence , a racing burlesque , abounding in the phraseology of the turf , and introducing in the last scene counterfeit presentments of a number of well-known sportsmen .</p>
   <p>An agreeable cynicism ran through both the talk and the lyrics , from one of which — a duet between King Schoeneus and his High Chamberlain , Lysimachus — I extract the following satire on turf morale :—</p>
   <p>Lys . There 's a time to win and a time to lose .</p>
   <p>Sch . Of course , of course , of course .</p>
   <p>Lys . You can make ‘ em safe whenever you choose —</p>
   <p>Sch . By force , by force , by force .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Lys . Then does n't it seem a sin and a shame</l>
     <l n="2">To stop such a pleasant and easy game ?</l>
     <l n="3">If a horse does n't win , why , who is to blame ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Sch . The horse , the horse , the horse .</l>
    </lg>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="8">Sch . Indeed , indeed , indeed !</l>
     <l n="9">I do n't understand what it 's all about ;</l>
     <l n="10">But a man must be punished , I have no doubt ,</l>

    </lg>

     <l n="17">For a season or two , you 'll observe with pain ,</l>
     <l n="18">They 'll hunt out abuses with might and main ;</l>
     <l n="19">Then the good old times will come back again .</l>
     <l n="20">Hurrah , hurrah , hurrah !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Elsewhere , there is a diverting bit of parody suggested by the extreme cautiousness and bad grammar of some newspaper racing prophecies . Hippomenes and Atalanta are the sole competitors in the race , and the local “ tipster ” thus discusses their prospects :—</p>
   <p>I have from time to time gone through the chances of the several competitors , so that to repeat what I have written is to go over very well-worn ground . Although the race is reduced to a match , it has lost none of its interest in the eyes of the public . It is a difficult race to meddle with , but the plunge must be made ; I shall , therefore , give my vote to Atalanta , which , if beaten , it may be by Hippomenes .</p>
   <p>Of “ Joan of Arc , ” the “ operatic burlesque ” written by Messrs. J. L. Shine and “ Adrian Ross ” to music by Mr. Osmond Carr ( Opera Comique , 1891 ) , the distinguishing feature — apart from the fact that the music is all original and all the work of one composer — is the neatness of the lyric writing , with which special pains appear to have been taken . Of Joan herself her father is made to sing as follows :—</p>

   <p>Of all the songs in the piece , however , perhaps the most vivacious is that in which De Richemont ( Mr. Arthur Roberts ) describes how he “ went to find Emin ":—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh , I went to find Emin Pasha , and started away for fun ,</l>
     <l n="2">With a box of weeds and a bag of beads , some tracts and a Maxim gun ;</l>
     <l n="3">My friends all said I should come back dead , but I did n't care a pin ,</l>
     <l n="4">So I ran up a bill and I made my will , and I went to find Emin !</l>
     <l n="5">I went to find Emin , I did , I looked for him far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="6">I found him right , I found him tight , and a lot of folks beside ;</l>
     <l n="7">Away through Darkest Africa , though it cost me lots of tin ,</l>
     <l n="8">For without a doubt I 'd find him out , when I went to find Emin !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Then I turned my face to a savage place , that is called</l>
     <l n="10">Boulogne-sur-Mer ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where the natives go on petits chevaux and the gay chemin de fer ;</l>
     <l n="12">And the girls of the tribe I wo n't describe , for I 'm rather a modest</l>
     <l n="13">man .</l>
     <l n="14">They are poor , I suppose , for they 're short of clothes , when they</l>
     <l n="15">take what they call les bains !</l>
     <l n="16">And they said to me , “ Oh , sapristi ! ” and the men remarked ,</l>
     <l n="17">“ Sacre ! ”</l>
     <l n="18">And vive la guerre aux pommes de terre , and vingt minutes d'arret !</l>
     <l n="19">Voulez-vous du boeuf ? j'ai huit ! j'ai neuf ! till they deafened me</l>
     <l n="20">with their din ,</l>
     <l n="21">So I parlez 'd bon soir and said au revoir , for I had to find</l>
     <l n="22">Emin !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">And at last I found Emin , poor chap , in the midst of the nigger bands</l>
     <l n="24">Who daily prowl , with horrible howl , along the Margate sands ;</l>
     <l n="25">I heard the tones of the rattling bones , and I hurried down to the</l>
     <l n="26">beach —</l>
     <l n="27">Full well I know that they will not go till you give them sixpence</l>
     <l n="28">each !</l>
     <l n="29">Said they , “ Uncle Ned , oh ! he berry dead , and de banjo out ob tune !</l>
     <l n="30">Oh ! doodah , day ! hear Massa play de song of de Whistling Coon !</l>
     <l n="31">If you ai n't a snob , you 'll give us a bob for blacking our blooming</l>
     <l n="32">skin ” —</l>
     <l n="33">But I took that band to the edge of the sand , and there I dropped</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Emin !</l>

   <p>I have not thought it necessary , in the preceding pages , to offer any apology for stage burlesque . One must regret that it sometimes lacks refinement in word and action , and that in the matter of costume it is not invariably decorous ; but that we shall always have it with us , in some form or other , may be accepted as incontrovertible . So long as there is anything extravagant in literature or manners — in the way either of simplicity or of any other quality — so long will travestie find both food and scope . That is the raison d'etre of theatrical burlesque — that it shall satirise the exaggerated and the extreme . It does not wage war against the judicious and the moderate . As H. J. Byron once wrote of his own craft :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Though some may scout it , ...</l>
     <l n="2">Burlesque is like the winnowing machine :</l>
     <l n="3">It simply blows away the husks , you know —</l>
     <l n="4">The goodly corn is not moved by the blow .</l>
     <l n="5">What arrant rubbish of the clap-trap school</l>
     <l n="6">Has vanished — thanks to pungent ridicule !</l>
     <l n="7">What stock stage-customs , nigh to bursting goaded ,</l>
     <l n="8">With so much “ blowing up ” have been exploded !</l>
     <l n="9">Had our light writers done no more than this ,</l>
     <l n="10">Their doggrel efforts scarce had been amiss .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In this defence of his calling , Byron had been anticipated by Planche , who , in one of his occasional pieces , introduced the following passage , in which Mr. and Mrs. Wigan and the representatives of Tragedy and Burlesque all figured . When Burlesque entered , Tragedy cried out —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Avaunt , and quit my sight ! let the earth hide thee .</l>
     <l n="2">Unreal mockery , hence ! I can n't abide thee !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Burlesque . Because I fling your follies in your face ,</l>
     <l n="4">And call back all the false starts of your race ,</l>
     <l n="5">Show up your shows , affect your affectation ,</l>
     <l n="6">And by such homoeopathic aggravation ,</l>
     <l n="7">Would cleanse your bosom of that perilous stuff</l>
     <l n="8">Which weighs upon our art — bombast and puff .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Mr. Wigan . Have you so good a purpose , then , in hand ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Burlesque . Else wherefore breathe I in dramatic land ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="11">Mrs. Wigan . I thought your aim was but to make us laugh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="12">Burlesque . Those who think so but understand me half .</l>
     <l n="13">Did not my thrice-renowned Thomas Thumb ,</l>
     <l n="14">That mighty mite , make mouthing Fustian dumb ?</l>
     <l n="15">Is Tilburina 's madness void of matter ?</l>
     <l n="16">Did great Bombastes strike no nonsense flatter ?</l>
     <l n="17">When in his words he 's not one to the wise ,</l>
     <l n="18">When his fool 's bolt spares folly as it flies ,</l>
     <l n="19">When in his chaff there 's not a grain to seize on ,</l>
     <l n="20">When in his rhyme there 's not a grain of reason ,</l>
     <l n="21">His slang but slang , no point beyond the pun ,</l>
     <l n="22">Burlesque may walk , for he will cease to run .</l>

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS . “ If it is well to judge by firstfruits ( and , generally speaking , the judgment is right ) , the new ‘ Whitefriars Library ’ should compass the very laudable designs of its projectors . The first monthly volume of the new series may fairly be said to be aflush with the finest promise . Mr. Andrew Lang 's ‘ ESSAYS IN LITTLE ’ is one of the most entertaining and bracing of books . Full of bright and engaging discourse , these charming and recreative essays are the best of good reading . Hard must be ‘ the cynic 's lips ’ from which Mr. Lang 's sportive pen does not ‘ dislodge the sneer , ’ harder that ‘ brow of care ’ whose wrinkles refuse to be smoothed by Mr. Lang 's gentle sarcasms and agreeable raillery .... ‘ ESSAYS IN LITTLE ’ ought to win every vote , and please every class of reader . ” — Saturday Review . “ The volume is delightful , and exhibits Mr. Lang 's light and dexterous touch , his broad literary sympathies , and his sound critical instinct to great advantage . ” — Times . “ ‘ The Whitefriars Library ’ has begun well . Its first issue is a volume by Mr. Andrew Lang , entitled ‘ ESSAYS IN LITTLE . ’ Mr. Lang is here at his best — alike in his most serious and his lightest moods . We find him turning without effort , and with equal success , from ‘ Homer and the Study of Greek , ’ to ‘ The Last Fashionable Novel ’ — on one page attacking grimly the modern newspaper tendency to tittle-tattle ( in a ‘ Letter to a Young Journalist ’ ) , on another devising a bright parody in prose or verse . Mr. Lang is in his most rollicking vein when treating of the once popular Haynes Bayly , the author of ‘ I 'd be a Butterfly ’ and things of that sort . With Bayly 's twaddling verse Mr. Lang is in satiric ecstasies ; he revels in its unconscious inanity , and burlesques it repeatedly with infinite gusto .... His tone is always urbane , his manner always bright and engaging . No one nowadays has a style at once so light and so well bred .... It is always pleasant , and frequently delightful . ” — Globe .

In this volume an attempt has been made to present in a series of striking episodical narratives the principal events in London history , and some of the more striking aspects of London life . Full particulars are given of plots and conspiracies , forgeries and murders , executions and hair-breadth escapes ; and many favourite old stories , not easily accessible now , are brought forward in a new dress , with all the light of recent research thrown upon them .

Crown 8vo . 3s . 6d . This work is the result of very extensive labour , and offers , it is believed , a completer view than has before been attempted of the diverse associations which lend so profound an interest to the Streets of London . It contains more than a thousand succinct references to remarkable persons , incidents , and scenes , with illustrative anecdotes and full explanations gathered from a vast number of authentic sources .

LONDON : HENRY &amp; CO ., 6 , BOUVERIE STREET , E. C ., AND AT ALL LIBRARIES AND BOOKSELLERS ’ . THE NEW ROMANCE . At all Libraries and Booksellers ’ . BY CLIVE HOLLAND . = RAYMI ; or , The Children of the Sun .= By the Author of “ The Golden Hawk . ” Crown 8vo , tastefully bound , 5s . Illustrated . “ Of all the writers who may be described as belonging to the school of Rider Haggard , Mr. Clive Holland is the most original and the most successful . His ‘ Raymi ’ would do no discredit to Mr. Haggard himself . There is room for improvement in the style , but that will come with use . What is of more importance in a new ( and presumably young ) writer is that he should have the root of the matter in him ; and in all the essentials for a good story — character , ‘ go , ’ and incidents — Mr. Holland manifests great facility . Hugh Carton , the hero , is put through some sad and dramatic experiences , and not the least enthralling of these is his encounter with Richard Savill , the buccaneer . It is under the most extraordinary circumstances that Hugh makes his acquaintance . Savill is vigorously drawn , so that one is able to realise the man as he was in his habit . Another part of the volume which contains several graphic passages is that devoted to a description of the Children of the Sun , with their rites and customs . Mr. Holland has written a previous romance , with which we are not acquainted , but his present venture certainly warrants the expectation of good work from him in the future . ” — Daily Chronicle . “ This is a good story — a mixture of the real and the romantic . Both elements are well worked out : the real is so like to Nature , that we are ready to think that the marvellous is not so very remote from it . ” — Spectator . BY LADY FLORENCE DIXIE . = GLORIANA ; or , The Revolution of 1900 .= With Portrait . Crown 8vo , 6s . “ There is abundant play of fancy in the book , as well as some of the ordinary elements of romance . ” — Queen . “ A good many of the characters have a touch of individuality ; and in a literary point of view this book is more carefully written and is more interesting than any of our author 's previous works . ” — Athenaeum . “ A prose Revolt of Islam . ” — Saturday Review . “ It is a book that cannot fail to interest any one who takes it up ; and to any one who thinks at all it will , as it has done for us , afford a good deal to think about . It is full of exciting incidents and adventures closely drawn from life . ” — St. Stephen 's Review . “ Giving the clever and accomplished novelist all credit for earnestness of purpose , it is scarcely possible to accept wholly the form in which she has urged and illustrated her views ; still we must respect and admire the talent with which she pleads the cause she has so much at heart .... The tale is well written , vigorous , and interesting . ” — Life . BY MRS. A. S. BRADSHAW . = WIFE OR SLAVE ?= By the Author of “ A Crimson Stain , ” etc . Second Edition . Crown 8vo , cloth , 2s . “ This story , which has no small merit as a work of imagination , makes its more direct appeal as a fictional presentment of the arguments for advancing the legal status of women , and making marriage a ‘ co-operation ’ rather than a ‘ despotism . ’ ” — Scotsman .
