   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>[ JUNE 22 ,<date>1897</date>] Come forth ! the world ’ s aflame with flags and flowers , The shout of bells fills full the shattered air , This is the crown of all your golden hours , More than all other hours august and fair ; This did the years prepare , A triumph for our Lady and our Queen , More rich than any king in any land hath seen . Clothed are your streets with scarlet , gold , and blue , Flowers under foot and banners over head , And while your people ’ s voice storms Heaven for you About your way are voiceless blessings shed , And over you are spread Wide wings of love , free love , tamed to your hand , Love that gold cannot buy , nor Majesty command . Not these mere visible millions only , share Your triumph — here all English hearts beat high , Nations far off your royal colours wear , And swell with unheard voice this loyal cry That strikes the English sky : A cloud of unseen witnesses is here To testify how great is<country>England</country>’ s Queen , and dear . From out the grey-veiled past , long years away , Come visionary faces , vision-led , And splendid shapes that are not of our day , The spirits of the mute and mighty dead , To see how Time has sped The fortunes of their<country>England</country>, and behold How much more great she is than in the days of old . The world can see them not ; but you can see — You the inheritor of all the past Wherein the dead , in noble heraldry , Blazoned the shield of<country>England</country>, and forecast The charge it bears at last — More splendid than the azure and the or Of the French lilies lost — long lost and sorrowed for . Here be the weaponed men , the English folk , Who in long ships across the swan ’ s bathfared , In whose rude tongue the voice of Freedom spoke , In whose rough hands the sword was bright and bared — The men who did and dared , And to their sons bequeathed the fighting blood That drives to Victory and will not be withstood . Here , in your ordered festival , O Queen , Mixed with the crowd and all unseen of these , On their long swords the wild Norse rovers lean And watch the progress of your pageantries , And on this young June breeze Float the bright pennons of the Cressy spears — Shine shadowy shafts that fell , as snow falls , at Poitiers . Here flutter phantom flags that once flew free Above the travail of the tournament ; Here gleam old swords , once wet for Liberty ; Old blood-stiff banners , worn with war and rent , Are with your fresh flowers blent , And by your crown , where love and fame consort , Shines the unvanquished cloven crown of Agincourt . Upon your river where , by day and night , Your world-adventuring ships come home again , Glide ghostly galleons , manned by men of might Who plucked the wings and singed the beard of<country>Spain</country>; The men who , not in vain , Saved to the children of a world new-trod The birth-tongue of our land , her freedom , and her God . Princes who lived to make our<country>England</country>great , Poets who wreathed her greatness with their song , Wise men who steered her heavy ship of State , Brave men who steered her battle-ships along , In spectral concourse throng To applaud the consummated power and pride Of that belovèd land for which they lived and died . The thousand un-named heroes who , sword-strong , Ploughed the long acre wherein Empire grows Wide as the world , and long as Time is long — These mark the crescence of the English rose Whose thorny splendour glows O ’ er far-off subject lands , by alien waves , A crown for<country>England</country>’ s brow , a garland for her graves . And faces out of unforgotten years , Faces long hidden by death ’ s misty screen , Faces you still can scarcely see for tears , Will smile on you to-day and near you lean , O Mother , Wife , and Queen ! With whispered love too sacred and too dear For any ear than yours , Mother and Wife , to hear . Lady , the crowd will vaunt to-day your fame , Daughter and heir of many mighty kings , The Queen of<country>England</country>, whose imperial name From<country>England</country>’ s heart and lips tumultuous springs In prayers and thanksgivings , Because your greatness and her greatness shine Merged each in each , as stars their beams that intertwine . Yet in the inmost heart , where folded close The richest treasures of the poorest lie , Love , whose clear eyes see many secrets , knows A nobler name than Queen to call you by , And breathes it silently ; But , ’ mid His listening crowd of angels , One Shall speak your name and say , “ Faithful and good , well done !”</docImprint>

     <l n="2">Ring , bells ! flags , fly ! and let the great crowd roar</l>
     <l n="3">Its ecstasy . Let the hid heart in prayer</l>
     <l n="4">Lift up your name . God bless you evermore ,</l>
     <l n="5">Lady , who have the noblest crown to wear</l>
     <l n="6">That ever woman wore .</l>

     <l n="11">When England ’ s crown , to Love ’ s acclaim , was laid</l>
     <l n="12">On the soft brightness of a maiden ’ s hair ,</l>
     <l n="13">Amid delight , Love trembled , half afraid ,</l>
     <l n="14">To give that little head such weight to bear ,—</l>
     <l n="15">Bind on so slight a maid</l>
     <l n="16">A kingdom ’ s purple — bid her hands hold high</l>
     <l n="17">The sceptre and the heavy orb of power ,</l>
     <l n="18">To give to youth and beauty for a dower</l>
     <l n="19">Care and a crown , sorrow and sovereignty .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="20">But from our hearts sprang an intenser flame</l>

     <l n="23">Entwined with all the splendour of that day ,</l>
     <l n="24">The letters of her name .</l>
     <l n="25">Then as fair roses grow ’ mid leaves of green ,</l>
     <l n="26">Love amid loyalty grew strong and close ,</l>
     <l n="27">To hedge a pleasaunce round our Royal rose ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">The trumpets spake — in sonorous triumph shout ,</l>

     <l n="32">And England ’ s heart spoke clamorous , through her sons ,</l>
     <l n="33">The exulting land throughout .</l>
     <l n="34">Down streets ablaze with light the flags unfurled ,</l>
     <l n="35">Along dark , lonely hills the joy-fires crept ,</l>
     <l n="36">And eager swords within their scabbards leapt</l>

     <l n="38">Those swords are rusted now . Good men and true</l>

     <l n="41">Which for her festival we bring her here ,</l>
     <l n="42">The long years ’ meed and due ;</l>
     <l n="43">The bud of homage graffed on chivalry .</l>
     <l n="44">God took the souls that shrined the jewel of love ,</l>

   <p>“ One has grown accustomed to the association of Mrs. Steel ’ s name with novels which deal exclusively with Indians and Anglo-Indians . Such powerful and remarkable books as ‘ The Potter ’ s Thumb ’ and ‘ On the Face of the Waters ,’ point to a specialism which is becoming one of the salient features of modern fiction ; but ‘ In the Tideway ,’ although dealing entirely with England and Scotland , presents the same keen and unerring grasp of character , the same faculty of conveying local atmosphere and colour , the same talent for creating strong and dramatic situations , and the same originality of thought and expression .... It is too late in the day to speak of Mrs. Steel ’ s position . This is assured , but this book adds greatly to an established position . It is profoundly impressive .”</p>
   <p>“ Wonderfully bright and lively both in dialogue and incidents .”— Scotsman .</p>
   <p>“ Admirably written .”— Glasgow Herald .</p>
   <p>“ The story is beyond question powerful . The characters are life-like and the dialogue is bright and natural .”— Manchester Guardian .</p>
   <p>“ As it is , the book is a sheer triumph of skill , one degree perhaps less valuable than a fully conceived presentation of the actual , but none the less admirable within its limits . There is care shown in every character .... But the real art , perhaps , lies less in the sequence of events or the portrayal of character , than in just this subtle suggestion everywhere of the abiding causeless mystery of land and sea .”— Academy .</p>

     <l n="1">Imperial 16mo , 6s .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The intention of this book is to present to the public a concise account of each of the churches of the City of London . If any reader should be induced to explore for himself these very interesting , but little known buildings , wherein he cannot fail to find ample to reward him for his pains , the object of the writer will have been attained .</p>
   <p>This volume is profusely illustrated from drawings specially made by Mr. Leonard Martin , and from photographs which have been prepared expressly for this work .</p>
   <p>“ The author of this book knows the City churches one and all , and has studied their monuments and archives with the patient reverence of the true antiquary , and , armed with the pen instead of the chisel , he has done his best to give permanent record to their claims on the nation , as well as on the man in the street .”— Leeds Mercury .</p>
   <p>“ His interesting text is accompanied by numerous illustrations , many of them full-page , and altogether his book is one which has every claim to a warm welcome from those who have a taste for ecclesiastical archæology .”— Glasgow Herald .</p>
   <p>“ This is an interesting and descriptive account of the various churches still extant in London , and is illustrated by several excellent photographs .... His work will be of value to the antiquarian , and of interest to the casual observer .”— Western Morning News .</p>
   <p>“ Mr . Daniell ’ s work will prove very interesting reading , as he has evidently taken great care in obtaining all the facts concerning the City churches , their history and associations .”— London .</p>

   <p>“ Will be one of the most popular romances , in one volume , of the season now opening . It is chiefly remarkable for the very marked and superior descriptive power displayed by the author in his rich and inspiring picture of the scenery of the Shasta Mountain .... So entirely unconventional , humorous , and bizarre , as to be quite unique .... The composition is bold and lucid .... He is an accomplished artist , and shows here at his best .... Mr. Bram Stoker will add widely to his reputation by this .”— Irish Times .</p>
   <p>“ A pure and well-told story .”— Glasgow Herald .</p>
   <p>“ The story is charmingly written , and deserves to be read for its brilliant open-air passages , and the portrait it contains of Grizzly Dick .”— Daily News .</p>
   <p>“ Mr . Bram Stoker has given the reading world one of the breeziest and most picturesque tales of life on the Pacific slope that has been penned for many a long day .”— Daily Telegraph .</p>

   <p>“ A pleasant story of life in Western America .... Fresh and unconventional .”— Publishers ’ Circular .</p>
   <p>“ Mr . Bram Stoker ’ s new book is a peculiarly bright and breezy story of Californian life .... There is nothing laboured in this description , no straining after undue effect .... The language is simple , yet the effect is always satisfying , and the word-picture is complete .”— Liverpool Daily Post .</p>
   <p>“ The narrative is entertaining throughout , with eloquent descriptions of scenery .”— Academy .</p>
   <p>“ Mr . Bram Stoker ’ s story is unflagging , full of vigour , and capital reading from end to end ; moreover , it conveys a vivid picture of life and manners in a corner of the world better known to him than to the majority of those who will read his book .”— Standard .</p>

   <p>“ Mr . Sykes served as a trooper in the M. R. F ., and depicts with much point and piquancy the life of the rank and file of that corps as it presented itself to him throughout the campaign . Still more delightful is the racy vein in which the humours of the situation are recounted . Mr. Sykes ’ narrative of ‘ Massacres and Escapes ’ is a noble record . Many incidents not hitherto mentioned of pluck and heroism are alluded to . His book is one of the best of its class we have yet had the pleasure of reviewing .”— South Africa .</p>

   <p>These letters are the genuine correspondence of a family in Norfolk during the Wars of the Roses . As such , they are altogether unique in character ; yet the language is not so antiquated as to present any serious difficulty to the modern reader . The topics of the letters relate partly to the private affairs of the family , and partly to the stirring events of the time : and the correspondence includes State papers , love letters , bailiff ’ s accounts , sentimental poems , jocular epistles , etc .</p>
   <p>“ This edition , which was first published some twenty years ago , is the standard edition of these remarkable historical documents , and contains upward of four hundred letters in addition to those published by Frere in 1823 . The reprint is in three small and compact volumes , and should be welcome to students of history as giving an important work in a convenient form .”— Scotsman .</p>
   <p>“ Unquestionably the standard edition of these curious literary relics of an age so long ago that the writers speak of the battles between the contending forces of York and Lancaster as occurrences of the moment .”— Daily News .</p>

   <p>The Nation ’ s Awakening</p>
   <p>By SPENSER WILKINSON</p>
   <p>Crown 8vo , 3s . 6d .</p>
   <p>“ The essence of true policy for Britain , the policy of common-sense , lies , according to Mr. Wilkinson , in choosing for assertion and for active defence those points in the extensive fringe of our world-wide interests , and those moments of time at which our self-defence will coincide with the self-defence of the world . This idea he works out in a clever and vigorous fashion .”— Glasgow Herald .</p>
   <p>“ He elaborates his views in four ‘ books ,’ dealing respectively with the aims of the other Great Powers , the defence of British interests , the organization of the Government , and ‘ the idea of the nation ,’ ... he deprecates a policy of isolation , and advocates a closer alliance with Germany .”— Scotsman .</p>
   <p>“ We consider Mr. Wilkinson completely proves his case . We agree ... that Mr. Spenser Wilkinson must make all men think . We welcome the volume , as we have welcomed previous volumes from Mr. Wilkinson ’ s pen , as of the highest value towards the formation of a national policy , of which we never stood in greater need .”— Athenæum .</p>

   <p>“ Certainly the influence of Mr. Curzon ’ s thoughtful generalizations , based as they are upon wide knowledge , and expressed in clear and picturesque language , cannot fail to assist in solving the problems of the Far East .”— Manchester Courier .</p>

   <p>“ Mr . Gleeson White has done his work well .... It is a book of beauty in one of its aspects , and an instructive and well-written critical treatise in the other .”— DAILY NEWS .</p>
   <p>“ In this very handsome volume Mr. Gleeson White has given us what is practically an exhaustive account of the admirable results obtained by designers and wood-engravers during the eventful years that lie between say 1855 and 1870 .... Simply invaluable to all students and collectors ....”— Glasgow Herald .</p>
   <p>“ ... This sumptuous volume , which Messrs. Constable have printed with their familiar mastery , and to which have been added the glories of hand-made paper and beautiful binding . With characteristic modesty Mr. Gleeson White would claim but the cataloguer ’ s place , and would write himself down only the guide to those who must follow . Certainly in the first instance the volume is a monument of painstaking research .... But a careful reading conveys the sense that the historians ’ and critics ’ parts belong not less to Mr. Gleeson White . The book , in short , must be in the hands of all who care for English art . Even those to whom the names on its title-page are nothing but names , will find it a surprising picture book , an album , if you will , to lay upon the table , but an album rich in suggestion and of singular and subtle charm .”— Pall Mall Gazette .</p>
   <p>“ We recognise the magnitude of the task undertaken by Mr. Gleeson White , as well as the care , patience , and learning that he has bestowed upon its adequate execution . For the printing , binding , arrangement of illustrations , and spacing of pages , we have nothing but praise to offer .”— Manchester Guardian .</p>
   <p>“ Mr . Gleeson White has written a work worthy of a foremost place among the standard reference books on matters artistic . Messrs. Constable have produced the book in a truly sumptuous manner .”— Publisher ’ s Circular .</p>

   <p>“ It confers a literary distinction upon the 60th year of the Victorian Era , and it gives the annus mirabilis yet a new title to memory .”— Newcastle Daily Chronicle .</p>
   <p>“ A true poet .... At any rate here unquestionably is a new poet , a wielder of beautiful words , a lover of beautiful things .’— I. ZANGWILL , in the Cosmopolitan , Sept ., 1895 .</p>

   <p>In half morocco , or full bound cloth , gilt top , 14s .</p>
   <p>This Atlas is the first publication of its kind , and for tourists and travellers generally it will be found particularly useful . There are Twenty-two Plans of the principal towns of our Indian Empire , based on the most recent surveys , and officially revised to date in India .</p>
   <p>The Topographical Section Maps are an accurate reduction of the Survey of India , and contain all the places described in Sir W. W. Hunter ’ s “ Gazetteer of India ,” according to his spelling .</p>
   <p>The Military , Railway , Telegraph , and Mission Station Maps are designed to meet the requirements of the Military and Civil Service , also missionaries and business men who at present have no means of obtaining the information they require in a handy form .</p>
   <p>The index contains upwards of ten thousand names , and will be found more complete than any yet attempted on a similar scale .</p>
   <p>Further to increase the utility of the work as a reference volume , an abstract of the 1891 Census has been added .</p>
   <p>“ It is tolerably safe to predict that no sensible traveller will go to India in future without providing himself with ‘ Constable ’ s Hand Atlas of India .’ Nothing half so useful has been done for many years to help both the traveller in India and the student at home . ‘ Constable ’ s Hand Atlas ’ is a pleasure to hold and to turn over .”— Athenæum .</p>
