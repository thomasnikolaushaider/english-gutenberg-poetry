     <l n="2">Made public never words inspired by thee ,</l>

     <l n="4">Things that were sacred and too dear to me .</l>

     <l n="5">Thy soul was noble ; through these fifteen years</l>
     <l n="6">Mine eyes familiar , found no fleck nor flaw ,</l>
     <l n="7">Stern to thyself , thy comrades ’ faults and fears</l>
     <l n="8">Proved generously thine only law .</l>

     <l n="9">Small joy was I to thee ; before we met</l>
     <l n="10">Sorrow had left thee all too sad to save .</l>

      <l n="14">Oh , Masters , you who rule the world ,</l>
      <l n="15">Will you not wait with me awhile ,</l>
      <l n="16">When swords are sheathed and sails are furled ,</l>
      <l n="17">And all the fields with harvest smile ?</l>
      <l n="18">I would not waste your time for long ,</l>
      <l n="19">I ask you but , when you are tired ,</l>
      <l n="20">To read how by the weak , the strong</l>

      <l n="26">When tents are pitched and work is done ,</l>
      <l n="27">While restful twilight broods above ,</l>
      <l n="28">By fresh-lit lamp , or dying sun ,</l>
      <l n="29">See in my songs how women love .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="30">We shared your lonely watch by night ,</l>
      <l n="31">We knew you faithful at the helm ,</l>
      <l n="32">Our thoughts went with you through the fight ,</l>
      <l n="33">That saved a soul ,— or wrecked a realm</l>
      <l n="34">Ah , how our hearts leapt forth to you ,</l>
      <l n="35">In pride and joy , when you prevailed ,</l>
      <l n="36">And when you died , serene and true :</l>
      <l n="37">— We wept in silence when you failed !</l>

      <l n="40">Here is the love , that is not sold ,</l>
      <l n="41">Here are the hearts to hail you Lord !</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="42">You played and lost the game ? What then ?</l>
      <l n="43">The rules are harsh and hard we know ,</l>
      <l n="44">You , still , Oh , brothers , are the men</l>
      <l n="45">Whom we in secret reverence so .</l>
      <l n="46">Your work was waste ? Maybe your share</l>
      <l n="47">Lay in the hour you laughed and kissed ;</l>
      <l n="48">Who knows but what your son shall wear</l>
      <l n="49">The laurels that his father missed ?</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="50">Ay , you who win , and you who lose ,</l>
      <l n="51">Whether you triumph ,— or despair ,—</l>
      <l n="52">When your returning footsteps choose</l>
      <l n="53">The homeward track , our love is there .</l>
      <l n="54">For , since the world is ordered thus ,</l>
      <l n="55">To you the fame , the stress , the sword ,</l>
      <l n="56">We can but wait , until to us</l>
      <l n="57">You give yourselves , for our reward .</l>

      <l n="58">To Whaler 's deck and Coral beach ,</l>

      <l n="61">I lay the cable of my thought .</l>

      <l n="63">( Though who am I , to give you praise ? )</l>
      <l n="64">Since what you are , and work you do ,</l>

      <l n="71">Although my life , which thou hast scarred and shaken ,</l>
      <l n="72">Retains awhile some influence of thee ,</l>
      <l n="73">As shells , by faithless waves long since forsaken ,</l>
      <l n="74">Still murmur with the music of the Sea ,</l>
     </lg>

      <l n="77">Or , if resigned from stress of Fate or Duty ,</l>
      <l n="78">Takes part of life away :— the dearer part .</l>

      <l n="80">Ah , the delusion of that summer night !</l>
      <l n="81">Thy soul vibrated at the rate of Fire ;</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="86">Ah , what hast thou done with that Lover of mine ?</l>
      <l n="87">The Lover who only cared for thee ?</l>
      <l n="88">Mine for a handful of nights , and thine</l>
      <l n="89">For the Nights that Are and the Days to Be ,</l>
      <l n="90">The scent of the Champa lost its sweet —</l>
      <l n="91">So sweet is was in the Times that Were !—</l>
      <l n="92">Since His alone , of the numerous feet</l>
      <l n="93">That climb my steps , have returned not there .</l>
      <l n="94">Ahi , Yasmini , return not there !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="95">Art thou yet athrill at the touch of His hand ,</l>
      <l n="96">Art thou still athirst for His waving hair ?</l>
      <l n="97">Nay , passion thou never couldst understand ,</l>
      <l n="98">Life 's heights and depths thou wouldst never dare .</l>
      <l n="99">The Great Things left thee untouched , unmoved ,</l>
      <l n="100">The Lesser Things had thy constant care .</l>
      <l n="101">Ah , what hast thou done with the Lover I loved ,</l>
      <l n="102">Who found me wanting , and thee so fair ?</l>
      <l n="103">Ahi , Yasmini , He found her fair !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="104">Nay , nay , the greatest of all was thine ;</l>
      <l n="105">The love of the One whom I craved for so ,</l>
      <l n="106">But much I doubt if thou couldst divine</l>
      <l n="107">The Grace and Glory of Love , or know</l>
      <l n="108">The worth of the One whom thine arms embraced .</l>
      <l n="109">I may misjudge thee , but who can tell ?</l>
      <l n="110">So hard it is , for the one displaced ,</l>
      <l n="111">To weigh the worth of a rival 's spell .</l>
      <l n="112">Ahi , Yasmini , thy rival 's spell !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="22">
      <l n="113">And Thou , whom I loved : have the seasons brought</l>
      <l n="114">That fair content , which allured Thee so ?</l>
      <l n="115">Is it all that Thy delicate fancy wrought ?</l>
      <l n="116">Yasmini wonders ; she may not know .</l>
      <l n="117">Yet never the Stars desert the sky ,</l>
      <l n="118">To fade away in the desolate Dawn ,</l>
      <l n="119">But Yasmini watches their glory die ,</l>
      <l n="120">And mourns for her own Bright Star withdrawn .</l>
      <l n="121">Ahi , Yasmini , the lonely dawn !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="23">
      <l n="122">Ah , never the lingering gold dies down</l>
      <l n="123">In a sunset flare of resplendent light ,</l>
      <l n="124">And never the palm-tree 's feathery crown</l>
      <l n="125">Uprears itself to the shadowy night ,</l>
      <l n="126">But Yasmini thinks of those evenings past ,</l>
      <l n="127">When she prayed the glow of the glimmering West</l>
      <l n="128">To vanish quickly , that night , at last ,</l>
      <l n="129">Might bring Thee back to her waiting breast .</l>
      <l n="130">Ahi , Yasmini , how sweet that rest !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="24">
      <l n="131">Yet I would not say that I always weep ;</l>
      <l n="132">The force , that made such a desperate thing</l>
      <l n="133">Of my love for Thee , has not fallen asleep ,</l>
      <l n="134">The blood still leaps , and the senses sing ,</l>
      <l n="135">While other passion has oft availed .</l>
      <l n="136">( Other Love — Ah , my One , forgive !—)</l>
      <l n="137">To aid , when Churus and Opium failed ;—</l>
      <l n="138">I could not suffer so much and live .</l>
      <l n="139">Ahi , Yasmini , who had to live !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="25">
      <l n="140">Nay , why should I say “ Forgive ” to Thee ?</l>
      <l n="141">To whom my lovers and I are naught ,</l>
      <l n="142">Who granted some passionate nights to me ,</l>
      <l n="143">Then rose and left me with never a thought !</l>
      <l n="144">And yet , Ah , yet , for those Nights that Were ,</l>
      <l n="145">Thy passive limbs and thy loose loved hair ,</l>
      <l n="146">I would pay , as I have paid , all these days ,</l>
      <l n="147">With the love that kills and the thought that slays .</l>
      <l n="148">Ahi , Yasmini , thy youth it slays !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="26">
      <l n="149">The youthful widow , with shaven hair ,</l>
      <l n="150">Whose senses ache for the love of a man ,</l>
      <l n="151">The young Priest , knowing that women are fair ,</l>
      <l n="152">Who stems his longing as best he can ,</l>
      <l n="153">These suffer not as I suffer for Thee ;</l>
      <l n="154">For the Soul desires what the senses crave ,</l>
      <l n="155">There will never be pleasure or peace for me ,</l>
      <l n="156">Since He who wounded , alone could save .</l>
      <l n="157">Ahi , Yasmini , He will not save !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="27">
      <l n="158">The torchlight flares , and the lovers lean</l>
      <l n="159">Towards Yasmini , with yearning eyes ,</l>
      <l n="160">Who dances , wondering what they mean ,</l>
      <l n="161">And gives cold kisses , and scant replies .</l>
      <l n="162">They talk of Love , she withholds the name ,—</l>
      <l n="163">( Love came to her as a Flame of Fire ! )</l>
      <l n="164">From things that are only a weary shame ;</l>
      <l n="165">Trivial Vanity ;— light Desire .</l>

      <l n="169">To curse the beauty that failed her then —</l>
      <l n="170">Ah , none of her lovers can understand !</l>
      <l n="171">How her whole life hung on that beauty 's power ,</l>
      <l n="172">The spell that waned at the final test ,</l>
      <l n="173">The charm that paled in the vital hour ,—</l>
      <l n="174">Which won so many ,— yet lost the best !</l>
