   <p>Mending Wall</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SOMETHING there is that does n't love a wall ,</l>
     <l n="2">That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it ,</l>
     <l n="3">And spills the upper boulders in the sun ;</l>
     <l n="4">And makes gaps even two can pass abreast .</l>
     <l n="5">The work of hunters is another thing :</l>
     <l n="6">I have come after them and made repair</l>
     <l n="7">Where they have left not one stone on a stone ,</l>
     <l n="8">But they would have the rabbit out of hiding ,</l>
     <l n="9">To please the yelping dogs . The gaps I mean ,</l>
     <l n="10">No one has seen them made or heard them made ,</l>
     <l n="11">But at spring mending-time we find them there .</l>
     <l n="12">I let my neighbour know beyond the hill ;</l>
     <l n="13">And on a day we meet to walk the line</l>
     <l n="14">And set the wall between us once again .</l>
     <l n="15">We keep the wall between us as we go .</l>
     <l n="16">To each the boulders that have fallen to each .</l>
     <l n="17">And some are loaves and some so nearly balls</l>
     <l n="18">We have to use a spell to make them balance :</l>
     <l n="19">“ Stay where you are until our backs are turned ! ”</l>
     <l n="20">We wear our fingers rough with handling them .</l>
     <l n="21">Oh , just another kind of out-door game ,</l>
     <l n="22">One on a side . It comes to little more :</l>
     <l n="23">There where it is we do not need the wall :</l>
     <l n="24">He is all pine and I am apple orchard .</l>
     <l n="25">My apple trees will never get across</l>
     <l n="26">And eat the cones under his pines , I tell him .</l>
     <l n="27">He only says , “ Good fences make good neighbours . ”</l>
     <l n="28">Spring is the mischief in me , and I wonder</l>
     <l n="29">If I could put a notion in his head :</l>
     <l n="30">“ Why do they make good neighbours ? Is n't it</l>
     <l n="31">Where there are cows ? But here there are no cows .</l>
     <l n="32">Before I built a wall I 'd ask to know</l>
     <l n="33">What I was walling in or walling out ,</l>
     <l n="34">And to whom I was like to give offence .</l>
     <l n="35">Something there is that does n't love a wall ,</l>
     <l n="36">That wants it down . ” I could say “ Elves ” to him ,</l>
     <l n="37">But it 's not elves exactly , and I 'd rather</l>
     <l n="38">He said it for himself . I see him there</l>
     <l n="39">Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top</l>
     <l n="40">In each hand , like an old-stone savage armed .</l>
     <l n="41">He moves in darkness as it seems to me ,</l>
     <l n="42">Not of woods only and the shade of trees .</l>
     <l n="43">He will not go behind his father 's saying ,</l>
     <l n="44">And he likes having thought of it so well</l>
     <l n="45">He says again , “ Good fences make good neighbours . ”</l>

     <l n="46">The Death of the Hired Man</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="47">MARY sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table</l>
     <l n="48">Waiting for Warren . When she heard his step ,</l>
     <l n="49">She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage</l>
     <l n="50">To meet him in the doorway with the news</l>
     <l n="51">And put him on his guard . “ Silas is back . ”</l>
     <l n="52">She pushed him outward with her through the door</l>
     <l n="53">And shut it after her . “ Be kind , ” she said .</l>
     <l n="54">She took the market things from Warren 's arms</l>
     <l n="55">And set them on the porch , then drew him down</l>
     <l n="56">To sit beside her on the wooden steps .</l>
     <l n="57">“ When was I ever anything but kind to him ?</l>
     <l n="58">But I 'll not have the fellow back , ” he said .</l>
     <l n="59">“ I told him so last haying , did n't I ?</l>
     <l n="60">‘ If he left then , ’ I said , ‘ that ended it . ’</l>
     <l n="61">What good is he ? Who else will harbour him</l>
     <l n="62">At his age for the little he can do ?</l>
     <l n="63">What help he is there 's no depending on .</l>
     <l n="64">Off he goes always when I need him most .</l>
     <l n="65">‘ He thinks he ought to earn a little pay ,</l>
     <l n="66">Enough at least to buy tobacco with ,</l>
     <l n="67">So he wo n't have to beg and be beholden . ’</l>
     <l n="68">‘ All right , ’ I say , ‘ I can n't afford to pay</l>
     <l n="69">Any fixed wages , though I wish I could . ’</l>
     <l n="70">‘ Someone else can . ’ ‘ Then someone else will have to . ’</l>
     <l n="71">I should n't mind his bettering himself</l>
     <l n="72">If that was what it was . You can be certain ,</l>
     <l n="73">When he begins like that , there 's someone at him</l>
     <l n="74">Trying to coax him off with pocket-money ,—</l>
     <l n="75">In haying time , when any help is scarce .</l>
     <l n="76">In winter he comes back to us . I 'm done . ”</l>
     <l n="77">“ Sh ! not so loud : he 'll hear you , ” Mary said .</l>
     <l n="78">“ I want him to : he 'll have to soon or late . ”</l>
     <l n="79">“ He 's worn out . He 's asleep beside the stove .</l>
     <l n="80">When I came up from Rowe 's I found him here ,</l>
     <l n="81">Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep ,</l>
     <l n="82">A miserable sight , and frightening , too —</l>
     <l n="83">You need n't smile — I did n't recognise him —</l>
     <l n="84">I was n't looking for him — and he 's changed .</l>
     <l n="85">Wait till you see . ”</l>
     <l n="86">“ Where did you say he 'd been ? ”</l>
     <l n="87">“ He did n't say . I dragged him to the house ,</l>
     <l n="88">And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke .</l>
     <l n="89">I tried to make him talk about his travels .</l>
     <l n="90">Nothing would do : he just kept nodding off . ”</l>
     <l n="91">“ What did he say ? Did he say anything ? ”</l>
     <l n="92">“ But little . ”</l>
     <l n="93">“ Anything ? Mary , confess</l>
     <l n="94">He said he 'd come to ditch the meadow for me . ”</l>
     <l n="95">“ Warren ! ”</l>
     <l n="96">“ But did he ? I just want to know . ”</l>
     <l n="97">“ Of course he did . What would you have him say ?</l>
     <l n="98">Surely you would n't grudge the poor old man</l>
     <l n="99">Some humble way to save his self-respect .</l>
     <l n="100">He added , if you really care to know ,</l>
     <l n="101">He meant to clear the upper pasture , too .</l>
     <l n="102">That sounds like something you have heard before ?</l>
     <l n="103">Warren , I wish you could have heard the way</l>
     <l n="104">He jumbled everything . I stopped to look</l>
     <l n="105">Two or three times — he made me feel so queer —</l>
     <l n="106">To see if he was talking in his sleep .</l>
     <l n="107">He ran on Harold Wilson — you remember —</l>
     <l n="108">The boy you had in haying four years since .</l>
     <l n="109">He 's finished school , and teaching in his college .</l>
     <l n="110">Silas declares you 'll have to get him back .</l>
     <l n="111">He says they two will make a team for work :</l>
     <l n="112">Between them they will lay this farm as smooth !</l>
     <l n="113">The way he mixed that in with other things .</l>
     <l n="114">He thinks young Wilson a likely lad , though daft</l>
     <l n="115">On education — you know how they fought</l>
     <l n="116">All through July under the blazing sun ,</l>
     <l n="117">Silas up on the cart to build the load ,</l>
     <l n="118">Harold along beside to pitch it on . ”</l>
     <l n="119">“ Yes , I took care to keep well out of earshot . ”</l>
     <l n="120">“ Well , those days trouble Silas like a dream .</l>
     <l n="121">You would n't think they would . How some things linger !</l>
     <l n="122">Harold 's young college boy 's assurance piqued him .</l>
     <l n="123">After so many years he still keeps finding</l>
     <l n="124">Good arguments he sees he might have used .</l>
     <l n="125">I sympathise . I know just how it feels</l>
     <l n="126">To think of the right thing to say too late .</l>
     <l n="127">Harold 's associated in his mind with Latin .</l>
     <l n="128">He asked me what I thought of Harold 's saying</l>
     <l n="129">He studied Latin like the violin</l>
     <l n="130">Because he liked it — that an argument !</l>
     <l n="131">He said he could n't make the boy believe</l>
     <l n="132">He could find water with a hazel prong —</l>
     <l n="133">Which showed how much good school had ever done him .</l>
     <l n="134">He wanted to go over that . But most of all</l>
     <l n="135">He thinks if he could have another chance</l>
     <l n="136">To teach him how to build a load of hay —— ”</l>
     <l n="137">“ I know , that 's Silas ’ one accomplishment .</l>
     <l n="138">He bundles every forkful in its place ,</l>
     <l n="139">And tags and numbers it for future reference ,</l>
     <l n="140">So he can find and easily dislodge it</l>
     <l n="141">In the unloading . Silas does that well .</l>
     <l n="142">He takes it out in bunches like big birds ’ nests .</l>
     <l n="143">You never see him standing on the hay</l>
     <l n="144">He 's trying to lift , straining to lift himself . ”</l>
     <l n="145">“ He thinks if he could teach him that , he 'd be</l>
     <l n="146">Some good perhaps to someone in the world .</l>
     <l n="147">He hates to see a boy the fool of books .</l>
     <l n="148">Poor Silas , so concerned for other folk ,</l>
     <l n="149">And nothing to look backward to with pride ,</l>
     <l n="150">And nothing to look forward to with hope ,</l>
     <l n="151">So now and never any different . ”</l>
     <l n="152">Part of a moon was falling down the west ,</l>
     <l n="153">Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills .</l>
     <l n="154">Its light poured softly in her lap . She saw</l>
     <l n="155">And spread her apron to it . She put out her hand</l>
     <l n="156">Among the harp-like morning-glory strings ,</l>
     <l n="157">Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves ,</l>
     <l n="158">As if she played unheard the tenderness</l>
     <l n="159">That wrought on him beside her in the night .</l>
     <l n="160">“ Warren , ” she said , “ he has come home to die :</l>
     <l n="161">You need n't be afraid he 'll leave you this time . ”</l>
     <l n="162">“ Home , ” he mocked gently .</l>
     <l n="163">“ Yes , what else but home ?</l>
     <l n="164">It all depends on what you mean by home .</l>
     <l n="165">Of course he 's nothing to us , any more</l>
     <l n="166">Than was the hound that came a stranger to us</l>
     <l n="167">Out of the woods , worn out upon the trail . ”</l>
     <l n="168">“ Home is the place where , when you have to go there ,</l>
     <l n="169">They have to take you in . ”</l>
     <l n="170">“ I should have called it</l>
     <l n="171">Something you somehow have n't to deserve . ”</l>
     <l n="172">Warren leaned out and took a step or two ,</l>
     <l n="173">Picked up a little stick , and brought it back</l>
     <l n="174">And broke it in his hand and tossed it by .</l>
     <l n="175">“ Silas has better claim on us you think</l>
     <l n="176">Than on his brother ? Thirteen little miles</l>
     <l n="177">As the road winds would bring him to his door .</l>
     <l n="178">Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day .</l>
     <l n="179">Why did n't he go there ? His brother 's rich ,</l>
     <l n="180">A somebody — director in the bank . ”</l>
     <l n="181">“ He never told us that . ”</l>
     <l n="182">“ We know it though . ”</l>
     <l n="183">“ I think his brother ought to help , of course .</l>
     <l n="184">I 'll see to that if there is need . He ought of right</l>
     <l n="185">To take him in , and might be willing to —</l>
     <l n="186">He may be better than appearances .</l>
     <l n="187">But have some pity on Silas . Do you think</l>
     <l n="188">If he 'd had any pride in claiming kin</l>
     <l n="189">Or anything he looked for from his brother ,</l>
     <l n="190">He 'd keep so still about him all this time ? ”</l>
     <l n="191">“ I wonder what 's between them . ”</l>
     <l n="192">“ I can tell you .</l>
     <l n="193">Silas is what he is — we would n't mind him —</l>
     <l n="194">But just the kind that kinsfolk can n't abide .</l>
     <l n="195">He never did a thing so very bad .</l>
     <l n="196">He do n't know why he is n't quite as good</l>
     <l n="197">As anyone . He wo n't be made ashamed</l>
     <l n="198">To please his brother , worthless though he is . ”</l>
     <l n="199">“ I can n't think Si ever hurt anyone . ”</l>
     <l n="200">“ No , but he hurt my heart the way he lay</l>
     <l n="201">And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back .</l>
     <l n="202">He would n't let me put him on the lounge .</l>
     <l n="203">You must go in and see what you can do .</l>
     <l n="204">I made the bed up for him there to-night .</l>
     <l n="205">You 'll be surprised at him — how much he 's broken .</l>
     <l n="206">His working days are done ; I 'm sure of it . ”</l>
     <l n="207">“ I 'd not be in a hurry to say that . ”</l>
     <l n="208">“ I have n't been . Go , look , see for yourself .</l>
     <l n="209">But , Warren , please remember how it is :</l>
     <l n="210">He 's come to help you ditch the meadow .</l>
     <l n="211">He has a plan . You must n't laugh at him .</l>
     <l n="212">He may not speak of it , and then he may .</l>
     <l n="213">I 'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud</l>
     <l n="214">Will hit or miss the moon . ”</l>
     <l n="215">It hit the moon .</l>
     <l n="216">Then there were three there , making a dim row ,</l>
     <l n="217">The moon , the little silver cloud , and she .</l>
     <l n="218">Warren returned — too soon , it seemed to her ,</l>
     <l n="219">Slipped to her side , caught up her hand and waited .</l>
     <l n="220">“ Warren , ” she questioned .</l>
     <l n="221">“ Dead , ” was all he answered .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="222">The Mountain</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="223">THE mountain held the town as in a shadow</l>
     <l n="224">I saw so much before I slept there once :</l>
     <l n="225">I noticed that I missed stars in the west ,</l>
     <l n="226">Where its black body cut into the sky .</l>
     <l n="227">Near me it seemed : I felt it like a wall</l>
     <l n="228">Behind which I was sheltered from a wind .</l>
     <l n="229">And yet between the town and it I found ,</l>
     <l n="230">When I walked forth at dawn to see new things ,</l>
     <l n="231">Were fields , a river , and beyond , more fields .</l>
     <l n="232">The river at the time was fallen away ,</l>
     <l n="233">And made a widespread brawl on cobble-stones ;</l>
     <l n="234">But the signs showed what it had done in spring ;</l>
     <l n="235">Good grass-land gullied out , and in the grass</l>
     <l n="236">Ridges of sand , and driftwood stripped of bark .</l>
     <l n="237">I crossed the river and swung round the mountain .</l>
     <l n="238">And there I met a man who moved so slow</l>
     <l n="239">With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart ,</l>
     <l n="240">It seemed no hand to stop him altogether .</l>
     <l n="241">“ What town is this ? ” I asked .</l>
     <l n="242">“ This ? Lunenburg . ”</l>
     <l n="243">Then I was wrong : the town of my sojourn ,</l>
     <l n="244">Beyond the bridge , was not that of the mountain ,</l>
     <l n="245">But only felt at night its shadowy presence .</l>
     <l n="246">“ Where is your village ? Very far from here ? ”</l>
     <l n="247">“ There is no village — only scattered farms .</l>
     <l n="248">We were but sixty voters last election .</l>
     <l n="249">We can n't in nature grow to many more :</l>
     <l n="250">That thing takes all the room ! ” He moved his goad .</l>
     <l n="251">The mountain stood there to be pointed at .</l>
     <l n="252">Pasture ran up the side a little way ,</l>
     <l n="253">And then there was a wall of trees with trunks :</l>
     <l n="254">After that only tops of trees , and cliffs</l>
     <l n="255">Imperfectly concealed among the leaves .</l>
     <l n="256">A dry ravine emerged from under boughs</l>
     <l n="257">Into the pasture .</l>
     <l n="258">“ That looks like a path .</l>
     <l n="259">Is that the way to reach the top from here ?—</l>
     <l n="260">Not for this morning , but some other time :</l>
     <l n="261">I must be getting back to breakfast now . ”</l>
     <l n="262">“ I do n't advise your trying from this side .</l>
     <l n="263">There is no proper path , but those that have</l>
     <l n="264">Been up , I understand , have climbed from Ladd 's .</l>
     <l n="265">That 's five miles back . You can n't mistake the place :</l>
     <l n="266">They logged it there last winter some way up .</l>
     <l n="267">I 'd take you , but I 'm bound the other way . ”</l>
     <l n="268">“ You 've never climbed it ? ”</l>
     <l n="269">“ I 've been on the sides</l>
     <l n="270">Deer-hunting and trout-fishing . There 's a brook</l>
     <l n="271">That starts up on it somewhere — I 've heard say</l>
     <l n="272">Right on the top , tip-top — a curious thing .</l>
     <l n="273">But what would interest you about the brook ,</l>
     <l n="274">It 's always cold in summer , warm in winter .</l>
     <l n="275">One of the great sights going is to see</l>
     <l n="276">It steam in winter like an ox 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="277">Until the bushes all along its banks</l>
     <l n="278">Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles —</l>
     <l n="279">You know the kind . Then let the sun shine on it ! ”</l>
     <l n="280">“ There ought to be a view around the world</l>
     <l n="281">From such a mountain — if it is n't wooded</l>
     <l n="282">Clear to the top . ” I saw through leafy screens</l>
     <l n="283">Great granite terraces in sun and shadow ,</l>
     <l n="284">Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up —</l>
     <l n="285">With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet ;</l>
     <l n="286">Or turn and sit on and look out and down ,</l>
     <l n="287">With little ferns in crevices at his elbow .</l>
     <l n="288">“ As to that I can n't say . But there 's the spring ,</l>
     <l n="289">Right on the summit , almost like a fountain .</l>
     <l n="290">That ought to be worth seeing . ”</l>
     <l n="291">“ If it 's there .</l>
     <l n="292">You never saw it ? ”</l>
     <l n="293">“ I guess there 's no doubt</l>
     <l n="294">About its being there . I never saw it .</l>
     <l n="295">It may not be right on the very top :</l>
     <l n="296">It would n't have to be a long way down</l>
     <l n="297">To have some head of water from above ,</l>
     <l n="298">And a good distance down might not be noticed</l>
     <l n="299">By anyone who 'd come a long way up .</l>
     <l n="300">One time I asked a fellow climbing it</l>
     <l n="301">To look and tell me later how it was . ”</l>
     <l n="302">“ What did he say ? ”</l>
     <l n="303">“ He said there was a lake</l>
     <l n="304">Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top . ”</l>
     <l n="305">“ But a lake 's different . What about the spring ? ”</l>
     <l n="306">“ He never got up high enough to see .</l>
     <l n="307">That 's why I do n't advise your trying this side .</l>
     <l n="308">He tried this side . I 've always meant to go</l>
     <l n="309">And look myself , but you know how it is :</l>
     <l n="310">It does n't seem so much to climb a mountain</l>
     <l n="311">You 've worked around the foot of all your life .</l>
     <l n="312">What would I do ? Go in my overalls ,</l>
     <l n="313">With a big stick , the same as when the cows</l>
     <l n="314">Have n't come down to the bars at milking time ?</l>
     <l n="315">Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear ?</l>
     <l n="316">‘ Twould n't seem real to climb for climbing it . ”</l>
     <l n="317">“ I should n't climb it if I did n't want to —</l>
     <l n="318">Not for the sake of climbing . What 's its name ? ”</l>
     <l n="319">“ We call it Hor : I do n't know if that 's right . ”</l>
     <l n="320">“ Can one walk around it ? Would it be too far ? ”</l>
     <l n="321">“ You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg ,</l>
     <l n="322">But it 's as much as ever you can do ,</l>
     <l n="323">The boundary lines keep in so close to it .</l>
     <l n="324">Hor is the township , and the township 's Hor —</l>
     <l n="325">And a few houses sprinkled round the foot ,</l>
     <l n="326">Like boulders broken off the upper cliff ,</l>
     <l n="327">Rolled out a little farther than the rest . ”</l>
     <l n="328">“ Warm in December , cold in June , you say ? ”</l>
     <l n="329">“ I do n't suppose the water 's changed at all .</l>
     <l n="330">You and I know enough to know it 's warm</l>
     <l n="331">Compared with cold , and cold compared with warm .</l>
     <l n="332">But all the fun 's in how you say a thing . ”</l>
     <l n="333">“ You 've lived here all your life ? ”</l>
     <l n="334">“ Ever since Hor</l>
     <l n="335">Was no bigger than a —— ” What , I did not hear .</l>
     <l n="336">He drew the oxen toward him with light touches</l>
     <l n="337">Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank ,</l>
     <l n="338">Gave them their marching orders and was moving .</l>

     <l n="340">LANCASTER bore him — such a little town ,</l>
     <l n="341">Such a great man . It does n't see him often</l>
     <l n="342">Of late years , though he keeps the old homestead</l>
     <l n="343">And sends the children down there with their mother</l>
     <l n="344">To run wild in the summer — a little wild .</l>
     <l n="345">Sometimes he joins them for a day or two</l>
     <l n="346">And sees old friends he somehow can n't get near .</l>
     <l n="347">They meet him in the general store at night ,</l>
     <l n="348">Pre-occupied with formidable mail ,</l>
     <l n="349">Rifling a printed letter as he talks .</l>
     <l n="350">They seem afraid . He would n't have it so :</l>
     <l n="351">Though a great scholar , he 's a democrat ,</l>
     <l n="352">If not at heart , at least on principle .</l>
     <l n="353">Lately when coming up to Lancaster</l>
     <l n="354">His train being late he missed another train</l>
     <l n="355">And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction</l>
     <l n="356">After eleven o'clock at night . Too tired</l>
     <l n="357">To think of sitting such an ordeal out ,</l>
     <l n="358">He turned to the hotel to find a bed .</l>
     <l n="359">“ No room , ” the night clerk said . “ Unless —— ”</l>
     <l n="360">Woodsville 's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps</l>
     <l n="361">And cars that shook and rattle — and one hotel .</l>
     <l n="362">“ You say ‘ unless . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="363">“ Unless you would n't mind</l>
     <l n="364">Sharing a room with someone else . ”</l>
     <l n="365">“ Who is it ? ”</l>
     <l n="366">“ A man . ”</l>
     <l n="367">“ So I should hope . What kind of man ? ”</l>
     <l n="368">“ I know him : he 's all right . A man 's a man .</l>
     <l n="369">Separate beds of course you understand . ”</l>
     <l n="370">The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on .</l>
     <l n="371">“ Who 's that man sleeping in the office chair ?</l>
     <l n="372">Has he had the refusal of my chance ? ”</l>
     <l n="373">“ He was afraid of being robbed or murdered .</l>
     <l n="374">What do you say ? ”</l>
     <l n="375">“ I 'll have to have a bed . ”</l>
     <l n="376">The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs</l>
     <l n="377">And down a narrow passage full of doors ,</l>
     <l n="378">At the last one of which he knocked and entered .</l>
     <l n="379">“ Lafe , here 's a fellow wants to share your room . ”</l>
     <l n="380">“ Show him this way . I 'm not afraid of him .</l>
     <l n="381">I 'm not so drunk I can n't take care of myself . ”</l>
     <l n="382">The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot .</l>
     <l n="383">“ This will be yours . Good-night , ” he said , and went .</l>
     <l n="384">“ Lafe was the name , I think ? ”</l>
     <l n="385">“ Yes , Layfayette .</l>
     <l n="386">You got it the first time . And yours ? ”</l>
     <l n="387">“ Magoon .</l>
     <l n="388">Doctor Magoon . ”</l>
     <l n="389">“ A Doctor ? ”</l>
     <l n="390">“ Well , a teacher . ”</l>
     <l n="391">“ Professor Square-the-circle-till-you'rehYpppHeNtired ?</l>

     <l n="394">Man that knew anything I happened in with .</l>
     <l n="395">I 'll ask you later — do n't let me forget it . ”</l>
     <l n="396">The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away .</l>
     <l n="397">A man ? A brute . Naked above the waist ,</l>
     <l n="398">He sat there creased and shining in the light ,</l>
     <l n="399">Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt .</l>
     <l n="400">“ I 'm moving into a size-larger shirt .</l>
     <l n="401">I 've felt mean lately ; mean 's no name for it .</l>
     <l n="402">I just found what the matter was to-night :</l>
     <l n="403">I 've been a-choking like a nursery tree</l>
     <l n="404">When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag .</l>
     <l n="405">I blamed it on the hot spell we 've been having .</l>
     <l n="406">‘ Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back ,</l>
     <l n="407">Not liking to own up I 'd grown a size .</l>
     <l n="408">Number eighteen this is . What size do you wear ? ”</l>
     <l n="409">The Doctor caught his throat convulsively .</l>
     <l n="410">“ Oh — ah — fourteen — fourteen . ”</l>
     <l n="411">“ Fourteen ! You say so !</l>
     <l n="412">I can remember when I wore fourteen .</l>
     <l n="413">And come to think I must have back at home</l>
     <l n="414">More than a hundred collars , size fourteen .</l>
     <l n="415">Too bad to waste them all . You ought to have them .</l>
     <l n="416">They 're yours and welcome ; let me send them to you .</l>
     <l n="417">What makes you stand there on one leg like that ?</l>
     <l n="418">You 're not much furtherer than where Kike left you .</l>
     <l n="419">You act as if you wished you had n't come .</l>
     <l n="420">Sit down or lie down , friend ; you make me nervous . ”</l>
     <l n="421">The Doctor made a subdued dash for it ,</l>
     <l n="422">And propped himself at bay against a pillow .</l>
     <l n="423">“ Not that way , with your shoes on Kike 's white bed .</l>
     <l n="424">You can n't rest that way . Let me pull your shoes off . ”</l>
     <l n="425">“ Do n't touch me , please — I say , do n't touch me , please .</l>
     <l n="426">I 'll not be put to bed by you , my man . ”</l>
     <l n="427">“ Just as you say . Have it your own way then .</l>
     <l n="428">‘ My man ’ is it ? You talk like a professor .</l>
     <l n="429">Speaking of who 's afraid of who , however ,</l>
     <l n="430">I 'm thinking I have more to lose than you</l>
     <l n="431">If anything should happen to be wrong .</l>
     <l n="432">Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat !</l>
     <l n="433">Let 's have a show down as an evidence</l>
     <l n="434">Of good faith . There is ninety dollars .</l>
     <l n="435">Come , if you 're not afraid . ”</l>
     <l n="436">“ I 'm not afraid .</l>
     <l n="437">There 's five : that 's all I carry . ”</l>
     <l n="438">“ I can search you ?</l>
     <l n="439">Where are you moving over to ? Stay still .</l>
     <l n="440">You 'd better tuck your money under you</l>
     <l n="441">And sleep on it the way I always do</l>
     <l n="442">When I 'm with people I do n't trust at night . ”</l>
     <l n="443">“ Will you believe me if I put it there</l>
     <l n="444">Right on the counterpane — that I do trust you ? ”</l>
     <l n="445">“ You 'd say so , Mister Man .— I 'm a collector .</l>
     <l n="446">My ninety is n't mine — you wo n't think that .</l>
     <l n="447">I pick it up a dollar at a time</l>
     <l n="448">All round the country for the Weekly News ,</l>

     <l n="453">I 'm sort of Something for it at the front .</l>
     <l n="454">My business is to find what people want :</l>
     <l n="455">They pay for it , and so they ought to have it .</l>
     <l n="456">Fairbanks , he says to me — he 's editor —</l>
     <l n="457">Feel out the public sentiment — he says .</l>
     <l n="458">A good deal comes on me when all is said .</l>
     <l n="459">The only trouble is we disagree</l>
     <l n="460">In politics : I 'm Vermont Democrat —</l>
     <l n="461">You know what that is , sort of double-dyed ;</l>
     <l n="462">The News has always been Republican .</l>
     <l n="463">Fairbanks , he says to me , ‘ Help us this year , ’</l>

     <l n="471">“ You see I 'm in with everybody , know ‘ em all .</l>
     <l n="472">I almost know their farms as well as they do . ”</l>
     <l n="473">“ You drive around ? It must be pleasant work . ”</l>
     <l n="474">“ It 's business , but I can n't say it 's not fun .</l>
     <l n="475">What I like best 's the lay of different farms ,</l>
     <l n="476">Coming out on them from a stretch of woods ,</l>
     <l n="477">Or over a hill or round a sudden corner .</l>
     <l n="478">I like to find folks getting out in spring ,</l>
     <l n="479">Raking the dooryard , working near the house .</l>
     <l n="480">Later they get out further in the fields .</l>
     <l n="481">Everything 's shut sometimes except the barn ;</l>
     <l n="482">The family 's all away in some back meadow .</l>
     <l n="483">There 's a hay load a-coming — when it comes .</l>
     <l n="484">And later still they all get driven in :</l>
     <l n="485">The fields are stripped to lawn , the garden patches</l>
     <l n="486">Stripped to bare ground , the apple trees</l>
     <l n="487">To whips and poles . There 's nobody about .</l>
     <l n="488">The chimney , though , keeps up a good brisk smoking .</l>
     <l n="489">And I lie back and ride . I take the reins</l>
     <l n="490">Only when someone 's coming , and the mare</l>
     <l n="491">Stops when she likes : I tell her when to go .</l>

     <l n="495">No matter if I have no errand there .</l>
     <l n="496">She thinks I 'm sociable . I maybe am .</l>
     <l n="497">It 's seldom I get down except for meals , though .</l>
     <l n="498">Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep ,</l>

     <l n="524">I 'll put the light out . Do n't you wait for me :</l>
     <l n="525">I 've just begun the night . You get some sleep .</l>
     <l n="526">I 'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door</l>
     <l n="527">When I come back so you 'll know who it is .</l>
     <l n="528">There 's nothing I 'm afraid of like scared people .</l>

     <l n="530">What am I doing carrying off this bottle ?</l>

     <l n="535">HE saw her from the bottom of the stairs</l>
     <l n="536">Before she saw him . She was starting down ,</l>
     <l n="537">Looking back over her shoulder at some fear .</l>
     <l n="538">She took a doubtful step and then undid it</l>
     <l n="539">To raise herself and look again . He spoke</l>
     <l n="540">Advancing toward her : “ What is it you see</l>
     <l n="541">From up there always — for I want to know . ”</l>
     <l n="542">She turned and sank upon her skirts at that ,</l>
     <l n="543">And her face changed from terrified to dull .</l>
     <l n="544">He said to gain time : “ What is it you see , ”</l>
     <l n="545">Mounting until she cowered under him .</l>
     <l n="546">“ I will find out now — you must tell me , dear . ”</l>
     <l n="547">She , in her place , refused him any help</l>
     <l n="548">With the least stiffening of her neck and silence .</l>
     <l n="549">She let him look , sure that he would n't see ,</l>
     <l n="550">Blind creature ; and a while he did n't see .</l>
     <l n="551">But at last he murmured , “ Oh , ” and again , “ Oh . ”</l>
     <l n="552">“ What is it — what ? ” she said .</l>
     <l n="553">“ Just that I see . ”</l>
     <l n="554">“ You do n't , ” she challenged . “ Tell me what it is . ”</l>
     <l n="555">“ The wonder is I did n't see at once .</l>
     <l n="556">I never noticed it from here before .</l>
     <l n="557">I must be wonted to it — that 's the reason .</l>
     <l n="558">The little graveyard where my people are !</l>
     <l n="559">So small the window frames the whole of it .</l>
     <l n="560">Not so much larger than a bedroom , is it ?</l>
     <l n="561">There are three stones of slate and one of marble ,</l>
     <l n="562">Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight</l>
     <l n="563">On the sidehill . We have n't to mind those .</l>
     <l n="564">But I understand : it is not the stones ,</l>
     <l n="565">But the child 's mound —— ”</l>
     <l n="566">“ Do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't , ” she cried .</l>
     <l n="567">She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm</l>
     <l n="568">That rested on the banister , and slid downstairs ;</l>
     <l n="569">And turned on him with such a daunting look ,</l>
     <l n="570">He said twice over before he knew himself :</l>
     <l n="571">“ Ca n't a man speak of his own child he 's lost ? ”</l>
     <l n="572">“ Not you ! Oh , where 's my hat ? Oh , I do n't need it !</l>
     <l n="573">I must get out of here . I must get air .</l>
     <l n="574">I do n't know rightly whether any man can . ”</l>
     <l n="575">“ Amy ! Do n't go to someone else this time .</l>
     <l n="576">Listen to me . I wo n't come down the stairs . ”</l>
     <l n="577">He sat and fixed his chin between his fists .</l>
     <l n="578">“ There 's something I should like to ask you , dear . ”</l>
     <l n="579">“ You do n't know how to ask it . ”</l>
     <l n="580">“ Help me , then . ”</l>
     <l n="581">Her fingers moved the latch for all reply .</l>
     <l n="582">“ My words are nearly always an offence .</l>
     <l n="583">I do n't know how to speak of anything</l>
     <l n="584">So as to please you . But I might be taught</l>
     <l n="585">I should suppose . I can n't say I see how .</l>
     <l n="586">A man must partly give up being a man</l>
     <l n="587">With women-folk . We could have some arrangement</l>
     <l n="588">By which I 'd bind myself to keep hands off</l>
     <l n="589">Anything special you 're a-mind to name .</l>
     <l n="590">Though I do n't like such things ‘ twixt those that love .</l>
     <l n="591">Two that do n't love can n't live together without them .</l>
     <l n="592">But two that do can n't live together with them . ”</l>
     <l n="593">She moved the latch a little . “ Do n't — do n't go .</l>
     <l n="594">Do n't carry it to someone else this time .</l>
     <l n="595">Tell me about it if it 's something human .</l>
     <l n="596">Let me into your grief . I 'm not so much</l>
     <l n="597">Unlike other folks as your standing there</l>
     <l n="598">Apart would make me out . Give me my chance .</l>
     <l n="599">I do think , though , you overdo it a little .</l>
     <l n="600">What was it brought you up to think it the thing</l>
     <l n="601">To take your mother-loss of a first child</l>
     <l n="602">So inconsolably — in the face of love .</l>
     <l n="603">You 'd think his memory might be satisfied —— ”</l>
     <l n="604">“ There you go sneering now ! ”</l>
     <l n="605">“ I 'm not , I 'm not !</l>
     <l n="606">You make me angry . I 'll come down to you .</l>
     <l n="607">God , what a woman ! And it 's come to this ,</l>
     <l n="608">A man can n't speak of his own child that 's dead . ”</l>
     <l n="609">“ You can n't because you do n't know how .</l>
     <l n="610">If you had any feelings , you that dug</l>
     <l n="611">With your own hand — how could you ?— his little grave ;</l>
     <l n="612">I saw you from that very window there ,</l>
     <l n="613">Making the gravel leap and leap in air ,</l>
     <l n="614">Leap up , like that , like that , and land so lightly</l>
     <l n="615">And roll back down the mound beside the hole .</l>
     <l n="616">I thought , Who is that man ? I did n't know you .</l>
     <l n="617">And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs</l>
     <l n="618">To look again , and still your spade kept lifting .</l>
     <l n="619">Then you came in . I heard your rumbling voice</l>
     <l n="620">Out in the kitchen , and I do n't know why ,</l>
     <l n="621">But I went near to see with my own eyes .</l>
     <l n="622">You could sit there with the stains on your shoes</l>
     <l n="623">Of the fresh earth from your own baby 's grave</l>
     <l n="624">And talk about your everyday concerns .</l>
     <l n="625">You had stood the spade up against the wall</l>
     <l n="626">Outside there in the entry , for I saw it . ”</l>
     <l n="627">“ I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed .</l>
     <l n="628">I 'm cursed . God , if I do n't believe I 'm cursed . ”</l>
     <l n="629">“ I can repeat the very words you were saying .</l>
     <l n="630">‘ Three foggy mornings and one rainy day</l>
     <l n="631">Will rot the best birch fence a man can build . ’</l>
     <l n="632">Think of it , talk like that at such a time !</l>
     <l n="633">What had how long it takes a birch to rot</l>
     <l n="634">To do with what was in the darkened parlour .</l>
     <l n="635">You could n't care ! The nearest friends can go</l>
     <l n="636">With anyone to death , comes so far short</l>
     <l n="637">They might as well not try to go at all .</l>
     <l n="638">No , from the time when one is sick to death ,</l>
     <l n="639">One is alone , and he dies more alone .</l>
     <l n="640">Friends make pretence of following to the grave ,</l>
     <l n="641">But before one is in it , their minds are turned</l>
     <l n="642">And making the best of their way back to life</l>
     <l n="643">And living people , and things they understand .</l>
     <l n="644">But the world 's evil . I wo n't have grief so</l>
     <l n="645">If I can change it . Oh , I wo n't , I wo n't ! ”</l>
     <l n="646">“ There , you have said it all and you feel better .</l>
     <l n="647">You wo n't go now . You 're crying . Close the door .</l>
     <l n="648">The heart 's gone out of it : why keep it up .</l>
     <l n="649">Amy ! There 's someone coming down the road ! ”</l>
     <l n="650">“ You — oh , you think the talk is all . I must go —</l>
     <l n="651">Somewhere out of this house . How can I make you —— ”</l>
     <l n="652">“ If — you — do ! ” She was opening the door wider .</l>
     <l n="653">“ Where do you mean to go ? First tell me that .</l>
     <l n="654">I 'll follow and bring you back by force . I will !— ”</l>

     <l n="655">The Black Cottage</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="656">WE chanced in passing by that afternoon</l>
     <l n="657">To catch it in a sort of special picture</l>
     <l n="658">Among tar-banded ancient cherry trees ,</l>
     <l n="659">Set well back from the road in rank lodged grass ,</l>
     <l n="660">The little cottage we were speaking of ,</l>
     <l n="661">A front with just a door between two windows ,</l>
     <l n="662">Fresh painted by the shower a velvet black .</l>
     <l n="663">We paused , the minister and I , to look .</l>
     <l n="664">He made as if to hold it at arm 's length</l>
     <l n="665">Or put the leaves aside that framed it in .</l>
     <l n="666">“ Pretty , ” he said . “ Come in . No one will care . ”</l>
     <l n="667">The path was a vague parting in the grass</l>
     <l n="668">That led us to a weathered window-sill .</l>
     <l n="669">We pressed our faces to the pane . “ You see , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="670">“ Everything 's as she left it when she died .</l>
     <l n="671">Her sons wo n't sell the house or the things in it .</l>
     <l n="672">They say they mean to come and summer here</l>
     <l n="673">Where they were boys . They have n't come this year .</l>
     <l n="674">They live so far away — one is out west —</l>
     <l n="675">It will be hard for them to keep their word .</l>
     <l n="676">Anyway they wo n't have the place disturbed . ”</l>
     <l n="677">A buttoned hair-cloth lounge spread scrolling arms</l>
     <l n="678">Under a crayon portrait on the wall</l>
     <l n="679">Done sadly from an old daguerreotype .</l>
     <l n="680">“ That was the father as he went to war .</l>
     <l n="681">She always , when she talked about war ,</l>
     <l n="682">Sooner or later came and leaned , half knelt</l>
     <l n="683">Against the lounge beside it , though I doubt</l>
     <l n="684">If such unlifelike lines kept power to stir</l>
     <l n="685">Anything in her after all the years .</l>
     <l n="686">He fell at Gettysburg or Fredericksburg ,</l>
     <l n="687">I ought to know — it makes a difference which :</l>
     <l n="688">Fredericksburg was n't Gettysburg , of course .</l>
     <l n="689">But what I 'm getting to is how forsaken</l>
     <l n="690">A little cottage this has always seemed ;</l>
     <l n="691">Since she went more than ever , but before —</l>
     <l n="692">I do n't mean altogether by the lives</l>
     <l n="693">That had gone out of it , the father first ,</l>
     <l n="694">Then the two sons , till she was left alone .</l>
     <l n="695">( Nothing could draw her after those two sons .</l>
     <l n="696">She valued the considerate neglect</l>
     <l n="697">She had at some cost taught them after years . )</l>
     <l n="698">I mean by the world 's having passed it by —</l>
     <l n="699">As we almost got by this afternoon .</l>
     <l n="700">It always seems to me a sort of mark</l>
     <l n="701">To measure how far fifty years have brought us .</l>
     <l n="702">Why not sit down if you are in no haste ?</l>
     <l n="703">These doorsteps seldom have a visitor .</l>
     <l n="704">The warping boards pull out their own old nails</l>
     <l n="705">With none to tread and put them in their place .</l>
     <l n="706">She had her own idea of things , the old lady .</l>
     <l n="707">And she liked talk . She had seen Garrison</l>
     <l n="708">And Whittier , and had her story of them .</l>
     <l n="709">One was n't long in learning that she thought</l>
     <l n="710">Whatever else the Civil War was for</l>
     <l n="711">It was n't just to keep the States together ,</l>
     <l n="712">Nor just to free the slaves , though it did both .</l>
     <l n="713">She would n't have believed those ends enough</l>
     <l n="714">To have given outright for them all she gave .</l>
     <l n="715">Her giving somehow touched the principle</l>
     <l n="716">That all men are created free and equal .</l>
     <l n="717">And to hear her quaint phrases — so removed</l>
     <l n="718">From the world 's view to-day of all those things .</l>
     <l n="719">That 's a hard mystery of Jefferson 's .</l>
     <l n="720">What did he mean ? Of course the easy way</l>
     <l n="721">Is to decide it simply is n't true .</l>
     <l n="722">It may not be . I heard a fellow say so .</l>
     <l n="723">But never mind , the Welshman got it planted</l>
     <l n="724">Where it will trouble us a thousand years .</l>
     <l n="725">Each age will have to reconsider it .</l>
     <l n="726">You could n't tell her what the West was saying ,</l>
     <l n="727">And what the South to her serene belief .</l>
     <l n="728">She had some art of hearing and yet not</l>
     <l n="729">Hearing the latter wisdom of the world .</l>
     <l n="730">White was the only race she ever knew .</l>
     <l n="731">Black she had scarcely seen , and yellow never .</l>
     <l n="732">But how could they be made so very unlike</l>
     <l n="733">By the same hand working in the same stuff ?</l>
     <l n="734">She had supposed the war decided that .</l>
     <l n="735">What are you going to do with such a person ?</l>
     <l n="736">Strange how such innocence gets its own way .</l>
     <l n="737">I should n't be surprised if in this world</l>
     <l n="738">It were the force that would at last prevail .</l>
     <l n="739">Do you know but for her there was a time</l>
     <l n="740">When to please younger members of the church ,</l>
     <l n="741">Or rather say non-members in the church ,</l>
     <l n="742">Whom we all have to think of nowadays ,</l>
     <l n="743">I would have changed the Creed a very little ?</l>
     <l n="744">Not that she ever had to ask me not to ;</l>
     <l n="745">It never got so far as that ; but the bare thought</l>
     <l n="746">Of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew ,</l>
     <l n="747">And of her half asleep was too much for me .</l>
     <l n="748">Why , I might wake her up and startle her .</l>
     <l n="749">It was the words ‘ descended into Hades ’</l>
     <l n="750">That seemed too pagan to our liberal youth .</l>
     <l n="751">You know they suffered from a general onslaught .</l>
     <l n="752">And well , if they were n't true why keep right on</l>
     <l n="753">Saying them like the heathen ? We could drop them .</l>
     <l n="754">Only — there was the bonnet in the pew .</l>
     <l n="755">Such a phrase could n't have meant much to her .</l>
     <l n="756">But suppose she had missed it from the Creed</l>
     <l n="757">As a child misses the unsaid Good-night ,</l>
     <l n="758">And falls asleep with heartache — how should I feel ?</l>
     <l n="759">I 'm just as glad she made me keep hands off ,</l>
     <l n="760">For , dear me , why abandon a belief</l>
     <l n="761">Merely because it ceases to be true .</l>
     <l n="762">Cling to it long enough , and not a doubt</l>
     <l n="763">It will turn true again , for so it goes .</l>
     <l n="764">Most of the change we think we see in life</l>
     <l n="765">Is due to truths being in and out of favour .</l>
     <l n="766">As I sit here , and oftentimes , I wish</l>
     <l n="767">I could be monarch of a desert land</l>
     <l n="768">I could devote and dedicate forever</l>
     <l n="769">To the truths we keep coming back and back to .</l>
     <l n="770">So desert it would have to be , so walled</l>
     <l n="771">By mountain ranges half in summer snow ,</l>
     <l n="772">No one would covet it or think it worth</l>
     <l n="773">The pains of conquering to force change on .</l>
     <l n="774">Scattered oases where men dwelt , but mostly</l>
     <l n="775">Sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk</l>
     <l n="776">Blown over and over themselves in idleness .</l>
     <l n="777">Sand grains should sugar in the natal dew</l>
     <l n="778">The babe born to the desert , the sand storm</l>
     <l n="779">Retard mid-waste my cowering caravans —</l>
     <l n="780">“ There are bees in this wall . ” He struck the clapboards ,</l>
     <l n="781">Fierce heads looked out ; small bodies pivoted .</l>
     <l n="782">We rose to go . Sunset blazed on the windows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="783">Blueberries</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="784">“ YOU ought to have seen what I saw on my way</l>
     <l n="785">To the village , through Mortenson 's pasture to-day :</l>
     <l n="786">Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb ,</l>
     <l n="787">Real sky-blue , and heavy , and ready to drum</l>
     <l n="788">In the cavernous pail of the first one to come !</l>
     <l n="789">And all ripe together , not some of them green</l>
     <l n="790">And some of them ripe ! You ought to have seen ! ”</l>
     <l n="791">“ I do n't know what part of the pasture you mean . ”</l>
     <l n="792">“ You know where they cut off the woods — let me see —</l>
     <l n="793">It was two years ago — or no !— can it be</l>
     <l n="794">No longer than that ?— and the following fall</l>
     <l n="795">The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall . ”</l>
     <l n="796">“ Why , there has n't been time for the bushes to grow .</l>
     <l n="797">That 's always the way with the blueberries , though :</l>
     <l n="798">There may not have been the ghost of a sign</l>
     <l n="799">Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine ,</l>
     <l n="800">But get the pine out of the way , you may burn</l>
     <l n="801">The pasture all over until not a fern</l>
     <l n="802">Or grass-blade is left , not to mention a stick ,</l>
     <l n="803">And presto , they 're up all around you as thick</l>
     <l n="804">And hard to explain as a conjuror 's trick . ”</l>
     <l n="805">“ It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit .</l>
     <l n="806">I taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot .</l>
     <l n="807">And after all really they 're ebony skinned :</l>
     <l n="808">The blue 's but a mist from the breath of the wind ,</l>
     <l n="809">A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand ,</l>
     <l n="810">And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned . ”</l>
     <l n="811">“ Does Mortenson know what he has , do you think ? ”</l>
     <l n="812">“ He may and not care and so leave the chewink</l>
     <l n="813">To gather them for him — you know what he is .</l>
     <l n="814">He wo n't make the fact that they 're rightfully his</l>
     <l n="815">An excuse for keeping us other folk out . ”</l>
     <l n="816">“ I wonder you did n't see Loren about . ”</l>
     <l n="817">“ The best of it was that I did . Do you know ,</l>
     <l n="818">I was just getting through what the field had to show</l>
     <l n="819">And over the wall and into the road ,</l>
     <l n="820">When who should come by , with a democrat-load</l>
     <l n="821">Of all the young chattering Lorens alive ,</l>
     <l n="822">But Loren , the fatherly , out for a drive . ”</l>
     <l n="823">“ He saw you , then ? What did he do ? Did he frown ? ”</l>
     <l n="824">“ He just kept nodding his head up and down .</l>
     <l n="825">You know how politely he always goes by .</l>
     <l n="826">But he thought a big thought — I could tell by his eye —</l>
     <l n="827">Which being expressed , might be this in effect :</l>
     <l n="828">‘ I have left those there berries , I shrewdly suspect ,</l>
     <l n="829">To ripen too long . I am greatly to blame . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="830">“ He 's a thriftier person than some I could name . ”</l>
     <l n="831">“ He seems to be thrifty ; and has n't he need ,</l>
     <l n="832">With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed ?</l>
     <l n="833">He has brought them all up on wild berries , they say ,</l>
     <l n="834">Like birds . They store a great many away .</l>
     <l n="835">They eat them the year round , and those they do n't eat</l>
     <l n="836">They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet . ”</l>
     <l n="837">“ Who cares what they say ? It 's a nice way to live ,</l>
     <l n="838">Just taking what Nature is willing to give ,</l>
     <l n="839">Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow . ”</l>
     <l n="840">“ I wish you had seen his perpetual bow —</l>
     <l n="841">And the air of the youngsters ! Not one of them turned ,</l>
     <l n="842">And they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned . ”</l>
     <l n="843">“ I wish I knew half what the flock of them know</l>
     <l n="844">Of where all the berries and other things grow ,</l>
     <l n="845">Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top</l>
     <l n="846">Of the boulder-strewn mountain , and when they will crop .</l>
     <l n="847">I met them one day and each had a flower</l>
     <l n="848">Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower ;</l>
     <l n="849">Some strange kind — they told me it had n't a name . ”</l>
     <l n="850">“ I 've told you how once not long after we came ,</l>
     <l n="851">I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth</l>
     <l n="852">By going to him of all people on earth</l>
     <l n="853">To ask if he knew any fruit to be had</l>
     <l n="854">For the picking . The rascal , he said he 'd be glad</l>
     <l n="855">To tell if he knew . But the year had been bad .</l>
     <l n="856">There had been some berries — but those were all gone .</l>
     <l n="857">He did n't say where they had been . He went on :</l>
     <l n="858">‘ I 'm sure — I 'm sure ’ — as polite as could be .</l>
     <l n="859">He spoke to his wife in the door , ‘ Let me see ,</l>
     <l n="860">Mame , we do n't know any good berrying place ? ’</l>
     <l n="861">It was all he could do to keep a straight face .</l>
     <l n="862">“ If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him ,</l>
     <l n="863">He 'll find he 's mistaken . See here , for a whim ,</l>
     <l n="864">We 'll pick in the Mortensons ’ pasture this year .</l>
     <l n="865">We 'll go in the morning , that is , if it 's clear ,</l>
     <l n="866">And the sun shines out warm : the vines must be wet .</l>
     <l n="867">It 's so long since I picked I almost forget</l>
     <l n="868">How we used to pick berries : we took one look round ,</l>
     <l n="869">Then sank out of sight like trolls underground ,</l>
     <l n="870">And saw nothing more of each other , or heard ,</l>
     <l n="871">Unless when you said I was keeping a bird</l>
     <l n="872">Away from its nest , and I said it was you .</l>
     <l n="873">‘ Well , one of us is . ’ For complaining it flew</l>
     <l n="874">Around and around us . And then for a while</l>
     <l n="875">We picked , till I feared you had wandered a mile ,</l>
     <l n="876">And I thought I had lost you . I lifted a shout</l>
     <l n="877">Too loud for the distance you were , it turned out ,</l>
     <l n="878">For when you made answer , your voice was as low</l>
     <l n="879">As talking — you stood up beside me , you know . ”</l>
     <l n="880">“ We sha'n ' t have the place to ourselves to enjoy —</l>
     <l n="881">Not likely , when all the young Lorens deploy .</l>
     <l n="882">They 'll be there to-morrow , or even to-night .</l>
     <l n="883">They wo n't be too friendly — they may be polite —</l>
     <l n="884">To people they look on as having no right</l>
     <l n="885">To pick where they 're picking . But we wo n't complain .</l>
     <l n="886">You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain ,</l>
     <l n="887">The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves ,</l>
     <l n="888">Like two kinds of jewels , a vision for thieves . ”</l>

     <l n="890">I DIDN'T make you know how glad I was</l>
     <l n="891">To have you come and camp here on our land .</l>
     <l n="892">I promised myself to get down some day</l>
     <l n="893">And see the way you lived , but I do n't know !</l>
     <l n="894">With a houseful of hungry men to feed</l>
     <l n="895">I guess you 'd find .... It seems to me</l>
     <l n="896">I can n't express my feelings any more</l>
     <l n="897">Than I can raise my voice or want to lift</l>
     <l n="898">My hand ( oh , I can lift it when I have to ) .</l>
     <l n="899">Did ever you feel so ? I hope you never .</l>
     <l n="900">It 's got so I do n't even know for sure</l>
     <l n="901">Whether I am glad , sorry , or anything .</l>
     <l n="902">There 's nothing but a voice-like left inside</l>
     <l n="903">That seems to tell me how I ought to feel ,</l>
     <l n="904">And would feel if I was n't all gone wrong .</l>
     <l n="905">You take the lake . I look and look at it .</l>
     <l n="906">I see it 's a fair , pretty sheet of water .</l>
     <l n="907">I stand and make myself repeat out loud</l>
     <l n="908">The advantages it has , so long and narrow ,</l>
     <l n="909">Like a deep piece of some old running river</l>
     <l n="910">Cut short off at both ends . It lies five miles</l>
     <l n="911">Straight away through the mountain notch</l>
     <l n="912">From the sink window where I wash the plates ,</l>
     <l n="913">And all our storms come up toward the house ,</l>
     <l n="914">Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter .</l>
     <l n="915">It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit</l>
     <l n="916">To step outdoors and take the water dazzle</l>
     <l n="917">A sunny morning , or take the rising wind</l>
     <l n="918">About my face and body and through my wrapper ,</l>
     <l n="919">When a storm threatened from the Dragon 's Den ,</l>
     <l n="920">And a cold chill shivered across the lake .</l>
     <l n="921">I see it 's a fair , pretty sheet of water ,</l>
     <l n="922">Our Willoughby ! How did you hear of it ?</l>
     <l n="923">I expect , though , everyone 's heard of it .</l>
     <l n="924">In a book about ferns ? Listen to that !</l>
     <l n="925">You let things more like feathers regulate</l>
     <l n="926">Your going and coming . And you like it here ?</l>
     <l n="927">I can see how you might . But I do n't know !</l>
     <l n="928">It would be different if more people came ,</l>
     <l n="929">For then there would be business . As it is ,</l>
     <l n="930">The cottages Len built , sometimes we rent them ,</l>
     <l n="931">Sometimes we do n't . We 've a good piece of shore</l>
     <l n="932">That ought to be worth something , and may yet .</l>
     <l n="933">But I do n't count on it as much as Len .</l>
     <l n="934">He looks on the bright side of everything ,</l>
     <l n="935">Including me . He thinks I 'll be all right</l>
     <l n="936">With doctoring . But it 's not medicine —</l>
     <l n="937">Lowe is the only doctor 's dared to say so —</l>
     <l n="938">It 's rest I want — there , I have said it out —</l>
     <l n="939">From cooking meals for hungry hired men</l>
     <l n="940">And washing dishes after them — from doing</l>
     <l n="941">Things over and over that just wo n't stay done .</l>
     <l n="942">By good rights I ought not to have so much</l>
     <l n="943">Put on me , but there seems no other way .</l>
     <l n="944">Len says one steady pull more ought to do it .</l>
     <l n="945">He says the best way out is always through .</l>
     <l n="946">And I agree to that , or in so far</l>
     <l n="947">As that I can see no way out but through —</l>
     <l n="948">Leastways for me — and then they 'll be convinced .</l>
     <l n="949">It 's not that Len do n't want the best for me .</l>
     <l n="950">It was his plan our moving over in</l>
     <l n="951">Beside the lake from where that day I showed you</l>
     <l n="952">We used to live — ten miles from anywhere .</l>
     <l n="953">We did n't change without some sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="954">But Len went at it to make up the loss .</l>
     <l n="955">His work 's a man 's , of course , from sun to sun ,</l>
     <l n="956">But he works when he works as hard as I do —</l>
     <l n="957">Though there 's small profit in comparisons .</l>
     <l n="958">( Women and men will make them all the same . )</l>
     <l n="959">But work ai n't all . Len undertakes too much .</l>
     <l n="960">He 's into everything in town . This year</l>
     <l n="961">It 's highways , and he 's got too many men</l>
     <l n="962">Around him to look after that make waste .</l>
     <l n="963">They take advantage of him shamefully ,</l>
     <l n="964">And proud , too , of themselves for doing so .</l>
     <l n="965">We have four here to board , great good-for-nothings ,</l>
     <l n="966">Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk</l>
     <l n="967">While I fry their bacon . Much they care !</l>
     <l n="968">No more put out in what they do or say</l>
     <l n="969">Than if I was n't in the room at all .</l>
     <l n="970">Coming and going all the time , they are :</l>
     <l n="971">I do n't learn what their names are , let alone</l>
     <l n="972">Their characters , or whether they are safe</l>
     <l n="973">To have inside the house with doors unlocked .</l>
     <l n="974">I 'm not afraid of them , though , if they 're not</l>
     <l n="975">Afraid of me . There 's two can play at that .</l>
     <l n="976">I have my fancies : it runs in the family .</l>
     <l n="977">My father 's brother was n't right . They kept him</l>
     <l n="978">Locked up for years back there at the old farm .</l>
     <l n="979">I 've been away once — yes , I 've been away .</l>
     <l n="980">The State Asylum . I was prejudiced ;</l>
     <l n="981">I would n't have sent anyone of mine there ;</l>
     <l n="982">You know the old idea — the only asylum</l>
     <l n="983">Was the poorhouse , and those who could afford ,</l>
     <l n="984">Rather than send their folks to such a place ,</l>
     <l n="985">Kept them at home ; and it does seem more human .</l>
     <l n="986">But it 's not so : the place is the asylum .</l>
     <l n="987">There they have every means proper to do with ,</l>
     <l n="988">And you are n't darkening other people 's lives —</l>
     <l n="989">Worse than no good to them , and they no good</l>
     <l n="990">To you in your condition ; you can n't know</l>
     <l n="991">Affection or the want of it in that state .</l>
     <l n="992">I 've heard too much of the old-fashioned way .</l>
     <l n="993">My father 's brother , he went mad quite young .</l>
     <l n="994">Some thought he had been bitten by a dog ,</l>
     <l n="995">Because his violence took on the form</l>
     <l n="996">Of carrying his pillow in his teeth ;</l>
     <l n="997">But it 's more likely he was crossed in love ,</l>
     <l n="998">Or so the story goes . It was some girl .</l>
     <l n="999">Anyway all he talked about was love .</l>
     <l n="1000">They soon saw he would do someone a mischief</l>
     <l n="1001">If he wa'n ' t kept strict watch of , and it ended</l>
     <l n="1002">In father 's building him a sort of cage ,</l>
     <l n="1003">Or room within a room , of hickory poles ,</l>
     <l n="1004">Like stanchions in the barn , from floor to ceiling ,—</l>
     <l n="1005">A narrow passage all the way around .</l>
     <l n="1006">Anything they put in for furniture</l>
     <l n="1007">He 'd tear to pieces , even a bed to lie on .</l>
     <l n="1008">So they made the place comfortable with straw ,</l>
     <l n="1009">Like a beast 's stall , to ease their consciences .</l>
     <l n="1010">Of course they had to feed him without dishes .</l>
     <l n="1011">They tried to keep him clothed , but he paraded</l>
     <l n="1012">With his clothes on his arm — all of his clothes .</l>
     <l n="1013">Cruel — it sounds . I ‘ spose they did the best</l>
     <l n="1014">They knew . And just when he was at the height ,</l>
     <l n="1015">Father and mother married , and mother came ,</l>
     <l n="1016">A bride , to help take care of such a creature ,</l>
     <l n="1017">And accommodate her young life to his .</l>
     <l n="1018">That was what marrying father meant to her .</l>
     <l n="1019">She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful</l>
     <l n="1020">By his shouts in the night . He 'd shout and shout</l>
     <l n="1021">Until the strength was shouted out of him ,</l>
     <l n="1022">And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion .</l>
     <l n="1023">He 'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string ,</l>
     <l n="1024">And let them go and make them twang until</l>
     <l n="1025">His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow .</l>
     <l n="1026">And then he 'd crow as if he thought that child 's play —</l>
     <l n="1027">The only fun he had . I 've heard them say , though ,</l>
     <l n="1028">They found a way to put a stop to it .</l>
     <l n="1029">He was before my time — I never saw him ;</l>
     <l n="1030">But the pen stayed exactly as it was</l>
     <l n="1031">There in the upper chamber in the ell ,</l>
     <l n="1032">A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter .</l>
     <l n="1033">I often think of the smooth hickory bars .</l>
     <l n="1034">It got so I would say — you know , half fooling —</l>
     <l n="1035">“ It 's time I took my turn upstairs in jail ” —</l>
     <l n="1036">Just as you will till it becomes a habit .</l>
     <l n="1037">No wonder I was glad to get away .</l>
     <l n="1038">Mind you , I waited till Len said the word .</l>
     <l n="1039">I did n't want the blame if things went wrong .</l>
     <l n="1040">I was glad though , no end , when we moved out ,</l>
     <l n="1041">And I looked to be happy , and I was ,</l>
     <l n="1042">As I said , for a while — but I do n't know !</l>
     <l n="1043">Somehow the change wore out like a prescription .</l>
     <l n="1044">And there 's more to it than just window-views</l>
     <l n="1045">And living by a lake . I 'm past such help —</l>
     <l n="1046">Unless Len took the notion , which he wo n't ,</l>
     <l n="1047">And I wo n't ask him — it 's not sure enough .</l>
     <l n="1048">I ‘ spose I 've got to go the road I 'm going :</l>
     <l n="1049">Other folks have to , and why should n't I ?</l>
     <l n="1050">I almost think if I could do like you ,</l>
     <l n="1051">Drop everything and live out on the ground —</l>
     <l n="1052">But it might be , come night , I should n't like it ,</l>
     <l n="1053">Or a long rain . I should soon get enough ,</l>
     <l n="1054">And be glad of a good roof overhead .</l>
     <l n="1055">I 've lain awake thinking of you , I 'll warrant ,</l>
     <l n="1056">More than you have yourself , some of these nights .</l>
     <l n="1057">The wonder was the tents were n't snatched away</l>
     <l n="1058">From over you as you lay in your beds .</l>
     <l n="1059">I have n't courage for a risk like that .</l>
     <l n="1060">Bless you , of course , you 're keeping me from work ,</l>
     <l n="1061">But the thing of it is , I need to be kept .</l>
     <l n="1062">There 's work enough to do — there 's always that ;</l>
     <l n="1063">But behind 's behind . The worst that you can do</l>
     <l n="1064">Is set me back a little more behind .</l>
     <l n="1065">I sha'n ' t catch up in this world , anyway .</l>
     <l n="1066">I 'd rather you 'd not go unless you must .</l>

     <l n="1067">After Apple-picking</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="1068">MY long two-pointed ladder 's sticking through a tree</l>
     <l n="1069">Toward heaven still ,</l>
     <l n="1070">And there 's a barrel that I did n't fill</l>
     <l n="1071">Beside it , and there may be two or three</l>
     <l n="1072">Apples I did n't pick upon some bough .</l>
     <l n="1073">But I am done with apple-picking now .</l>
     <l n="1074">Essence of winter sleep is on the night ,</l>
     <l n="1075">The scent of apples : I am drowsing off .</l>
     <l n="1076">I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight</l>
     <l n="1077">I got from looking through a pane of glass</l>
     <l n="1078">I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough</l>
     <l n="1079">And held against the world of hoary grass .</l>
     <l n="1080">It melted , and I let it fall and break .</l>
     <l n="1081">But I was well</l>
     <l n="1082">Upon my way to sleep before it fell ,</l>
     <l n="1083">And I could tell</l>
     <l n="1084">What form my dreaming was about to take .</l>
     <l n="1085">Magnified apples appear and disappear ,</l>
     <l n="1086">Stem end and blossom end ,</l>
     <l n="1087">And every fleck of russet showing clear .</l>
     <l n="1088">My instep arch not only keeps the ache ,</l>
     <l n="1089">It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round .</l>
     <l n="1090">I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend .</l>
     <l n="1091">And I keep hearing from the cellar bin</l>
     <l n="1092">The rumbling sound</l>
     <l n="1093">Of load on load of apples coming in .</l>
     <l n="1094">For I have had too much</l>
     <l n="1095">Of apple-picking : I am overtired</l>
     <l n="1096">Of the great harvest I myself desired .</l>
     <l n="1097">There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch ,</l>
     <l n="1098">Cherish in hand , lift down , and not let fall .</l>
     <l n="1099">For all</l>
     <l n="1100">That struck the earth ,</l>
     <l n="1101">No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble ,</l>
     <l n="1102">Went surely to the cider-apple heap</l>
     <l n="1103">As of no worth .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="1111">THERE were three in the meadow by the brook</l>
     <l n="1112">Gathering up windrows , piling cocks of hay ,</l>
     <l n="1113">With an eye always lifted toward the west</l>
     <l n="1114">Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud</l>
     <l n="1115">Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger</l>
     <l n="1116">Flickering across its bosom . Suddenly</l>
     <l n="1117">One helper , thrusting pitchfork in the ground ,</l>
     <l n="1118">Marched himself off the field and home . One stayed .</l>
     <l n="1119">The town-bred farmer failed to understand .</l>
     <l n="1120">“ What is there wrong ? ”</l>
     <l n="1121">“ Something you just now said . ”</l>
     <l n="1122">“ What did I say ? ”</l>
     <l n="1123">“ About our taking pains . ”</l>
     <l n="1124">“ To cock the hay ?— because it 's going to shower ?</l>
     <l n="1125">I said that more than half an hour ago .</l>
     <l n="1126">I said it to myself as much as you . ”</l>
     <l n="1127">“ You did n't know . But James is one big fool .</l>
     <l n="1128">He thought you meant to find fault with his work .</l>
     <l n="1129">That 's what the average farmer would have meant .</l>
     <l n="1130">James would take time , of course , to chew it over</l>
     <l n="1131">Before he acted : he 's just got round to act . ”</l>
     <l n="1132">“ He is a fool if that 's the way he takes me . ”</l>
     <l n="1133">“ Do n't let it bother you . You 've found out something .</l>
     <l n="1134">The hand that knows his business wo n't be told</l>
     <l n="1135">To do work better or faster — those two things .</l>
     <l n="1136">I 'm as particular as anyone :</l>
     <l n="1137">Most likely I 'd have served you just the same .</l>
     <l n="1138">But I know you do n't understand our ways .</l>
     <l n="1139">You were just talking what was in your mind ,</l>
     <l n="1140">What was in all our minds , and you were n't hinting .</l>
     <l n="1141">Tell you a story of what happened once :</l>
     <l n="1142">I was up here in Salem at a man 's</l>
     <l n="1143">Named Sanders with a gang of four or five</l>
     <l n="1144">Doing the haying . No one liked the boss .</l>
     <l n="1145">He was one of the kind sports call a spider ,</l>
     <l n="1146">All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy</l>
     <l n="1147">From a humped body nigh as big 's a biscuit .</l>
     <l n="1148">But work ! that man could work , especially</l>
     <l n="1149">If by so doing he could get more work</l>
     <l n="1150">Out of his hired help . I 'm not denying</l>
     <l n="1151">He was hard on himself . I could n't find</l>
     <l n="1152">That he kept any hours — not for himself .</l>
     <l n="1153">Daylight and lantern-light were one to him :</l>
     <l n="1154">I 've heard him pounding in the barn all night .</l>
     <l n="1155">But what he liked was someone to encourage .</l>
     <l n="1156">Them that he could n't lead he 'd get behind</l>
     <l n="1157">And drive , the way you can , you know , in mowing —</l>
     <l n="1158">Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off .</l>
     <l n="1159">I 'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks</l>
     <l n="1160">( We call that bulling ) . I 'd been watching him .</l>
     <l n="1161">So when he paired off with me in the hayfield</l>
     <l n="1162">To load the load , thinks I , Look out for trouble .</l>
     <l n="1163">I built the load and topped it off ; old Sanders</l>
     <l n="1164">Combed it down with a rake and says , ‘ O. K . ’</l>
     <l n="1165">Everything went well till we reached the barn</l>
     <l n="1166">With a big catch to empty in a bay .</l>
     <l n="1167">You understand that meant the easy job</l>
     <l n="1168">For the man up on top of throwing down</l>
     <l n="1169">The hay and rolling it off wholesale ,</l>
     <l n="1170">Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting .</l>
     <l n="1171">You would n't think a fellow 'd need much urging</l>
     <l n="1172">Under these circumstances , would you now ?</l>
     <l n="1173">But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands ,</l>
     <l n="1174">And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit ,</l>
     <l n="1175">Shouts like an army captain , ‘ Let her come ! ’</l>
     <l n="1176">Thinks I , D'ye mean it ? ‘ What was that you said ? ’</l>
     <l n="1177">I asked out loud , so 's there 'd be no mistake ,</l>
     <l n="1178">‘ Did you say , Let her come ? ’ ‘ Yes , let her come . ’</l>
     <l n="1179">He said it over , but he said it softer .</l>
     <l n="1180">Never you say a thing like that to a man ,</l>
     <l n="1181">Not if he values what he is . God , I 'd as soon</l>
     <l n="1182">Murdered him as left out his middle name .</l>
     <l n="1183">I 'd built the load and knew right where to find it .</l>
     <l n="1184">Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for</l>
     <l n="1185">Like meditating , and then I just dug in</l>
     <l n="1186">And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots .</l>
     <l n="1187">I looked over the side once in the dust</l>
     <l n="1188">And caught sight of him treading-water-like ,</l>
     <l n="1189">Keeping his head above . ‘ Damn ye , ’ I says ,</l>
     <l n="1190">‘ That gets ye ! ’ He squeaked like a squeezed rat .</l>
     <l n="1191">That was the last I saw or heard of him .</l>
     <l n="1192">I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off .</l>
     <l n="1193">As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck ,</l>
     <l n="1194">And sort of waiting to be asked about it ,</l>
     <l n="1195">One of the boys sings out , ‘ Where 's the old man ? ’</l>
     <l n="1196">‘ I left him in the barn under the hay .</l>
     <l n="1197">If ye want him , ye can go and dig him out . ’</l>
     <l n="1198">They realized from the way I swobbed my neck</l>
     <l n="1199">More than was needed something must be up .</l>
     <l n="1200">They headed for the barn ; I stayed where I was .</l>
     <l n="1201">They told me afterward . First they forked hay ,</l>
     <l n="1202">A lot of it , out into the barn floor .</l>
     <l n="1203">Nothing ! They listened for him . Not a rustle .</l>
     <l n="1204">I guess they thought I 'd spiked him in the temple</l>
     <l n="1205">Before I buried him , or I could n't have managed .</l>
     <l n="1206">They excavated more . ‘ Go keep his wife</l>
     <l n="1207">Out of the barn . ’ Someone looked in a window ,</l>
     <l n="1208">And curse me if he was n't in the kitchen</l>
     <l n="1209">Slumped way down in a chair , with both his feet</l>
     <l n="1210">Stuck in the oven , the hottest day that summer .</l>
     <l n="1211">He looked so clean disgusted from behind</l>
     <l n="1212">There was no one that dared to stir him up ,</l>
     <l n="1213">Or let him know that he was being looked at .</l>
     <l n="1214">Apparently I had n't buried him</l>
     <l n="1215">( I may have knocked him down ) ; but my just trying</l>
     <l n="1216">To bury him had hurt his dignity .</l>
     <l n="1217">He had gone to the house so 's not to meet me .</l>
     <l n="1218">He kept away from us all afternoon .</l>
     <l n="1219">We tended to his hay . We saw him out</l>
     <l n="1220">After a while picking peas in his garden :</l>
     <l n="1221">He could n't keep away from doing something . ”</l>
     <l n="1222">“ Were n't you relieved to find he was n't dead ? ”</l>
     <l n="1223">“ No ! and yet I do n't know — it 's hard to say .</l>
     <l n="1224">I went about to kill him fair enough . ”</l>
     <l n="1225">“ You took an awkward way . Did he discharge you ? ”</l>
     <l n="1226">“ Discharge me ? No ! He knew I did just right . ”</l>

     <l n="1228">A GOVERNOR it was proclaimed this time ,</l>
     <l n="1229">When all who would come seeking in New Hampshire</l>
     <l n="1230">Ancestral memories might come together .</l>
     <l n="1231">And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow ,</l>
     <l n="1232">A rock-strewn town where farming has fallen off ,</l>
     <l n="1233">And sprout-lands flourish where the axe has gone .</l>
     <l n="1234">Someone had literally run to earth</l>
     <l n="1235">In an old cellar hole in a by-road</l>
     <l n="1236">The origin of all the family there .</l>
     <l n="1237">Thence they were sprung , so numerous a tribe</l>
     <l n="1238">That now not all the houses left in town</l>
     <l n="1239">Made shift to shelter them without the help</l>
     <l n="1240">Of here and there a tent in grove and orchard .</l>
     <l n="1241">They were at Bow , but that was not enough :</l>
     <l n="1242">Nothing would do but they must fix a day</l>
     <l n="1243">To stand together on the crater 's verge</l>
     <l n="1244">That turned them on the world , and try to fathom</l>
     <l n="1245">The past and get some strangeness out of it .</l>
     <l n="1246">But rain spoiled all . The day began uncertain ,</l>
     <l n="1247">With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted .</l>
     <l n="1248">The young folk held some hope out to each other</l>
     <l n="1249">Till well toward noon when the storm settled down</l>
     <l n="1250">With a swish in the grass . “ What if the others</l>
     <l n="1251">Are there , ” they said . “ It is n't going to rain . ”</l>
     <l n="1252">Only one from a farm not far away</l>
     <l n="1253">Strolled thither , not expecting he would find</l>
     <l n="1254">Anyone else , but out of idleness .</l>
     <l n="1255">One , and one other , yes , for there were two .</l>
     <l n="1256">The second round the curving hillside road</l>
     <l n="1257">Was a girl ; and she halted some way off</l>
     <l n="1258">To reconnoitre , and then made up her mind</l>
     <l n="1259">At least to pass by and see who he was ,</l>
     <l n="1260">And perhaps hear some word about the weather .</l>
     <l n="1261">This was some Stark she did n't know . He nodded .</l>
     <l n="1262">“ No fête to-day , ” he said .</l>
     <l n="1263">“ It looks that way . ”</l>
     <l n="1264">She swept the heavens , turning on her heel .</l>
     <l n="1265">“ I only idled down . ”</l>
     <l n="1266">“ I idled down . ”</l>
     <l n="1267">Provision there had been for just such meeting</l>
     <l n="1268">Of stranger cousins , in a family tree</l>
     <l n="1269">Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch</l>
     <l n="1270">Of the one bearing it done in detail —</l>
     <l n="1271">Some zealous one 's laborious device .</l>
     <l n="1272">She made a sudden movement toward her bodice ,</l>
     <l n="1273">As one who clasps her heart . They laughed together .</l>
     <l n="1274">“ Stark ? ” he inquired . “ No matter for the proof . ”</l>
     <l n="1275">“ Yes , Stark . And you ? ”</l>
     <l n="1276">“ I 'm Stark . ” He drew his passport .</l>
     <l n="1277">“ You know we might not be and still be cousins :</l>
     <l n="1278">The town is full of Chases , Lowes , and Baileys ,</l>
     <l n="1279">All claiming some priority in Starkness .</l>
     <l n="1280">My mother was a Lane , yet might have married</l>
     <l n="1281">Anyone upon earth and still her children</l>
     <l n="1282">Would have been Starks , and doubtless here to-day . ”</l>
     <l n="1283">“ You riddle with your genealogy</l>
     <l n="1284">Like a Viola . I do n't follow you . ”</l>
     <l n="1285">“ I only mean my mother was a Stark</l>
     <l n="1286">Several times over , and by marrying father</l>
     <l n="1287">No more than brought us back into the name . ”</l>
     <l n="1288">“ One ought not to be thrown into confusion</l>
     <l n="1289">By a plain statement of relationship ,</l>
     <l n="1290">But I own what you say makes my head spin .</l>
     <l n="1291">You take my card — you seem so good at such things —</l>
     <l n="1292">And see if you can reckon our cousinship .</l>
     <l n="1293">Why not take seats here on the cellar wall</l>
     <l n="1294">And dangle feet among the raspberry vines ? ”</l>
     <l n="1295">“ Under the shelter of the family tree . ”</l>
     <l n="1296">“ Just so — that ought to be enough protection . ”</l>
     <l n="1297">“ Not from the rain . I think it 's going to rain . ”</l>
     <l n="1298">“ It 's raining . ”</l>
     <l n="1299">“ No , it 's misting ; let 's be fair .</l>
     <l n="1300">Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes ? ”</l>
     <l n="1301">The situation was like this : the road</l>
     <l n="1302">Bowed outward on the mountain half-way up ,</l>
     <l n="1303">And disappeared and ended not far off .</l>
     <l n="1304">No one went home that way . The only house</l>
     <l n="1305">Beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod .</l>
     <l n="1306">And below roared a brook hidden in trees ,</l>
     <l n="1307">The sound of which was silence for the place .</l>
     <l n="1308">This he sat listening to till she gave judgment .</l>
     <l n="1309">“ On father 's side , it seems , we 're — let me see —— ”</l>
     <l n="1310">“ Do n't be too technical .— You have three cards . ”</l>
     <l n="1311">“ Four cards , one yours , three mine , one for each branch</l>
     <l n="1312">Of the Stark family I 'm a member of . ”</l>
     <l n="1313">“ D'you know a person so related to herself</l>
     <l n="1314">Is supposed to be mad . ”</l>
     <l n="1315">“ I may be mad . ”</l>
     <l n="1316">“ You look so , sitting out here in the rain</l>
     <l n="1317">Studying genealogy with me</l>
     <l n="1318">You never saw before . What will we come to</l>
     <l n="1319">With all this pride of ancestry , we Yankees ?</l>
     <l n="1320">I think we 're all mad . Tell me why we 're here</l>
     <l n="1321">Drawn into town about this cellar hole</l>
     <l n="1322">Like wild geese on a lake before a storm ?</l>
     <l n="1323">What do we see in such a hole , I wonder . ”</l>
     <l n="1324">“ The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc ,</l>
     <l n="1325">Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out of .</l>
     <l n="1326">This is the pit from which we Starks were digged . ”</l>
     <l n="1327">“ You must be learned . That 's what you see in it ? ”</l>
     <l n="1328">“ And what do you see ? ”</l>
     <l n="1329">“ Yes , what do I see ?</l>
     <l n="1330">First let me look . I see raspberry vines —— ”</l>
     <l n="1331">“ Oh , if you 're going to use your eyes , just hear</l>
     <l n="1332">What I see . It 's a little , little boy ,</l>
     <l n="1333">As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun ;</l>
     <l n="1334">He 's groping in the cellar after jam ,</l>
     <l n="1335">He thinks it 's dark and it 's flooded with daylight . ”</l>
     <l n="1336">“ He 's nothing . Listen . When I lean like this</l>
     <l n="1337">I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly ,—</l>
     <l n="1338">With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug —</l>
     <l n="1339">Bless you , it is n't Grandsir Stark , it 's Granny ,</l>
     <l n="1340">But the pipe 's there and smoking and the jug .</l>
     <l n="1341">She 's after cider , the old girl , she 's thirsty ;</l>
     <l n="1342">Here 's hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely . ”</l>
     <l n="1343">“ Tell me about her . Does she look like me ? ”</l>
     <l n="1344">“ She should , should n't she , you 're so many times</l>
     <l n="1345">Over descended from her . I believe</l>
     <l n="1346">She does look like you . Stay the way you are .</l>
     <l n="1347">The nose is just the same , and so 's the chin —</l>
     <l n="1348">Making allowance , making due allowance . ”</l>
     <l n="1349">“ You poor , dear , great , great , great , great Granny ! ”</l>
     <l n="1350">“ See that you get her greatness right . Do n't stint her . ”</l>
     <l n="1351">“ Yes , it 's important , though you think it is n't .</l>
     <l n="1352">I wo n't be teased . But see how wet I am . ”</l>
     <l n="1353">“ Yes , you must go ; we can n't stay here for ever .</l>
     <l n="1354">But wait until I give you a hand up .</l>
     <l n="1355">A bead of silver water more or less</l>
     <l n="1356">Strung on your hair wo n't hurt your summer looks .</l>
     <l n="1357">I wanted to try something with the noise</l>
     <l n="1358">That the brook raises in the empty valley .</l>
     <l n="1359">We have seen visions — now consult the voices .</l>
     <l n="1360">Something I must have learned riding in trains</l>
     <l n="1361">When I was young . I used the roar</l>
     <l n="1362">To set the voices speaking out of it ,</l>
     <l n="1363">Speaking or singing , and the band-music playing .</l>
     <l n="1364">Perhaps you have the art of what I mean .</l>
     <l n="1365">I 've never listened in among the sounds</l>
     <l n="1366">That a brook makes in such a wild descent .</l>
     <l n="1367">It ought to give a purer oracle . ”</l>
     <l n="1368">“ It 's as you throw a picture on a screen :</l>
     <l n="1369">The meaning of it all is out of you ;</l>
     <l n="1370">The voices give you what you wish to hear . ”</l>
     <l n="1371">“ Strangely , it 's anything they wish to give . ”</l>
     <l n="1372">“ Then I do n't know . It must be strange enough .</l>
     <l n="1373">I wonder if it 's not your make-believe .</l>
     <l n="1374">What do you think you 're like to hear to-day ? ”</l>
     <l n="1375">“ From the sense of our having been together —</l>
     <l n="1376">But why take time for what I 'm like to hear ?</l>
     <l n="1377">I 'll tell you what the voices really say .</l>
     <l n="1378">You will do very well right where you are</l>
     <l n="1379">A little longer . I must n't feel too hurried ,</l>
     <l n="1380">Or I can n't give myself to hear the voices . ”</l>
     <l n="1381">“ Is this some trance you are withdrawing into ? ”</l>
     <l n="1382">“ You must be very still ; you must n't talk . ”</l>
     <l n="1383">“ I 'll hardly breathe . ”</l>

     <l n="1389">“ I let you say that — on consideration . ”</l>

     <l n="1395">“ Be good . The voices say :</l>
     <l n="1396">Call her Nausicaa , and take a timber</l>
     <l n="1397">That you shall find lies in the cellar charred</l>
     <l n="1398">Among the raspberries , and hew and shape it</l>
     <l n="1399">For a door-sill or other corner piece</l>

     <l n="1401">The life is not yet all gone out of it .</l>
     <l n="1402">And come and make your summer dwelling here ,</l>
     <l n="1403">And perhaps she will come , still unafraid ,</l>
     <l n="1404">And sit before you in the open door</l>
     <l n="1405">With flowers in her lap until they fade ,</l>
     <l n="1406">But not come in across the sacred sill —— ”</l>

     <l n="1415">You will be likely to regard as sacred</l>
     <l n="1416">Anything she may say . But let me warn you ,</l>
     <l n="1417">Folks in her day were given to plain speaking .</l>
     <l n="1418">You think you 'd best tempt her at such a time ? ”</l>
     <l n="1419">“ It rests with us always to cut her off . ”</l>
     <l n="1420">“ Well then , it 's Granny speaking : ‘ I dunnow !</l>
     <l n="1421">Mebbe I 'm wrong to take it as I do .</l>
     <l n="1422">There ai n't no names quite like the old ones though ,</l>
     <l n="1423">Nor never will be to my way of thinking .</l>
     <l n="1424">One must n't bear too hard on the new comers ,</l>
     <l n="1425">But there 's a dite too many of them for comfort .</l>
     <l n="1426">I should feel easier if I could see</l>
     <l n="1427">More of the salt wherewith they 're to be salted .</l>
     <l n="1428">Son , you do as you 're told ! You take the timber —</l>
     <l n="1429">It 's as sound as the day when it was cut —</l>
     <l n="1430">And begin over —— ’ There , she 'd better stop .</l>
     <l n="1431">You can see what is troubling Granny , though .</l>
     <l n="1432">But do n't you think we sometimes make too much</l>
     <l n="1433">Of the old stock ? What counts is the ideals ,</l>
     <l n="1434">And those will bear some keeping still about . ”</l>
     <l n="1435">“ I can see we are going to be good friends . ”</l>
     <l n="1436">“ I like your ‘ going to be . ’ You said just now</l>

     <l n="1439">I let you say all that . But I must go now . ”</l>
     <l n="1440">“ You let me say it ? on consideration ?</l>
     <l n="1441">How shall we say good-bye in such a case ? ”</l>
     <l n="1442">“ How shall we ? ”</l>
     <l n="1443">“ Will you leave the way to me ? ”</l>
     <l n="1444">“ No , I do n't trust your eyes . You 've said enough .</l>
     <l n="1445">Now give me your hand up .— Pick me that flower . ”</l>
     <l n="1446">“ Where shall we meet again ? ”</l>
     <l n="1447">“ Nowhere but here</l>
     <l n="1448">Once more before we meet elsewhere . ”</l>
     <l n="1449">“ In rain ? ”</l>
     <l n="1450">“ It ought to be in rain . Sometime in rain .</l>
     <l n="1451">In rain to-morrow , shall we , if it rains ?</l>
     <l n="1452">But if we must , in sunshine . ” So she went .</l>

     <l n="1469">“ Have n't you seen him ? Strange what set you off</l>

     <l n="1471">You can n't have passed each other . I know what :</l>

     <l n="1474">Though what good you can be , or anyone —</l>

     <l n="1476">“ Yes , what 's it all about ? When did she go ? ”</l>
     <l n="1477">“ Two weeks since . ”</l>
     <l n="1478">“ She 's in earnest , it appears . ”</l>
     <l n="1479">“ I 'm sure she wo n't come back . She 's hiding somewhere .</l>
     <l n="1480">I do n't know where myself . John thinks I do .</l>
     <l n="1481">He thinks I only have to say the word ,</l>
     <l n="1482">And she 'll come back . But , bless you , I 'm her mother —</l>
     <l n="1483">I can n't talk to her , and , Lord , if I could ! ”</l>
     <l n="1484">“ It will go hard with John . What will he do ?</l>
     <l n="1485">He can n't find anyone to take her place . ”</l>
     <l n="1486">“ Oh , if you ask me that , what will he do ?</l>
     <l n="1487">He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together ,</l>
     <l n="1488">With me to sit and tell him everything ,</l>
     <l n="1489">What 's wanted and how much and where it is .</l>
     <l n="1490">But when I 'm gone — of course I can n't stay here :</l>

     <l n="1492">He and I only hinder one another .</l>
     <l n="1493">I tell them they can n't get me through the door , though :</l>
     <l n="1494">I 've been built in here like a big church organ .</l>
     <l n="1495">We 've been here fifteen years . ”</l>
     <l n="1496">“ That 's a long time</l>
     <l n="1497">To live together and then pull apart .</l>
     <l n="1498">How do you see him living when you 're gone ?</l>
     <l n="1499">Two of you out will leave an empty house . ”</l>
     <l n="1500">“ I do n't just see him living many years ,</l>
     <l n="1501">Left here with nothing but the furniture .</l>
     <l n="1502">I hate to think of the old place when we 're gone ,</l>
     <l n="1503">With the brook going by below the yard ,</l>
     <l n="1504">And no one here but hens blowing about .</l>
     <l n="1505">If he could sell the place , but then , he can n't :</l>
     <l n="1506">No one will ever live on it again .</l>
     <l n="1507">It 's too run down . This is the last of it .</l>
     <l n="1508">What I think he will do , is let things smash .</l>
     <l n="1509">He 'll sort of swear the time away . He 's awful !</l>
     <l n="1510">I never saw a man let family troubles</l>
     <l n="1511">Make so much difference in his man 's affairs .</l>
     <l n="1512">He 's just dropped everything . He 's like a child .</l>
     <l n="1513">I blame his being brought up by his mother .</l>
     <l n="1514">He 's got hay down that 's been rained on three times .</l>
     <l n="1515">He hoed a little yesterday for me :</l>
     <l n="1516">I thought the growing things would do him good .</l>
     <l n="1517">Something went wrong . I saw him throw the hoe</l>
     <l n="1518">Sky-high with both hands . I can see it now —</l>
     <l n="1519">Come here — I 'll show you — in that apple tree .</l>
     <l n="1520">That 's no way for a man to do at his age :</l>
     <l n="1521">He 's fifty-five , you know , if he 's a day . ”</l>
     <l n="1522">“ Are n't you afraid of him ? What 's that gun for ? ”</l>
     <l n="1523">“ Oh , that 's been there for hawks since chicken-time .</l>
     <l n="1524">John Hall touch me ! Not if he knows his friends .</l>
     <l n="1525">I 'll say that for him , John 's no threatener</l>
     <l n="1526">Like some men folk . No one 's afraid of him ;</l>
     <l n="1527">All is , he 's made up his mind not to stand</l>
     <l n="1528">What he has got to stand . ”</l>
     <l n="1529">“ Where is Estelle ?</l>
     <l n="1530">Could n't one talk to her ? What does she say ?</l>
     <l n="1531">You say you do n't know where she is . ”</l>
     <l n="1532">“ Nor want to !</l>
     <l n="1533">She thinks if it was bad to live with him ,</l>
     <l n="1534">It must be right to leave him . ”</l>
     <l n="1535">“ Which is wrong ! ”</l>
     <l n="1536">“ Yes , but he should have married her . ”</l>
     <l n="1537">“ I know . ”</l>
     <l n="1538">“ The strain 's been too much for her all these years :</l>
     <l n="1539">I can n't explain it any other way .</l>
     <l n="1540">It 's different with a man , at least with John :</l>
     <l n="1541">He knows he 's kinder than the run of men .</l>
     <l n="1542">Better than married ought to be as good</l>
     <l n="1543">As married — that 's what he has always said .</l>
     <l n="1544">I know the way he 's felt — but all the same ! ”</l>
     <l n="1545">“ I wonder why he does n't marry her</l>
     <l n="1546">And end it . ”</l>
     <l n="1547">“ Too late now : she would n't have him .</l>
     <l n="1548">He 's given her time to think of something else .</l>
     <l n="1549">That 's his mistake . The dear knows my interest</l>
     <l n="1550">Has been to keep the thing from breaking up .</l>
     <l n="1551">This is a good home : I do n't ask for better .</l>
     <l n="1552">But when I 've said , ‘ Why should n't they be married , ’</l>
     <l n="1553">He 'd say , ‘ Why should they ? ’ no more words than that . ”</l>
     <l n="1554">“ And after all why should they ? John 's been fair</l>
     <l n="1555">I take it . What was his was always hers .</l>
     <l n="1556">There was no quarrel about property . ”</l>
     <l n="1557">“ Reason enough , there was no property .</l>
     <l n="1558">A friend or two as good as own the farm ,</l>
     <l n="1559">Such as it is . It is n't worth the mortgage . ”</l>
     <l n="1560">“ I mean Estelle has always held the purse . ”</l>
     <l n="1561">“ The rights of that are harder to get at .</l>
     <l n="1562">I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse .</l>
     <l n="1563">‘ Twas we let him have money , not he us .</l>
     <l n="1564">John 's a bad farmer . I 'm not blaming him .</l>
     <l n="1565">Take it year in , year out , he does n't make much .</l>
     <l n="1566">We came here for a home for me , you know ,</l>
     <l n="1567">Estelle to do the housework for the board</l>
     <l n="1568">Of both of us . But look how it turns out :</l>
     <l n="1569">She seems to have the housework , and besides ,</l>
     <l n="1570">Half of the outdoor work , though as for that ,</l>
     <l n="1571">He 'd say she does it more because she likes it .</l>
     <l n="1572">You see our pretty things are all outdoors .</l>
     <l n="1573">Our hens and cows and pigs are always better</l>
     <l n="1574">Than folks like us have any business with .</l>
     <l n="1575">Farmers around twice as well off as we</l>
     <l n="1576">Have n't as good . They do n't go with the farm .</l>
     <l n="1577">One thing you can n't help liking about John ,</l>
     <l n="1578">He 's fond of nice things — too fond , some would say .</l>
     <l n="1579">But Estelle do n't complain : she 's like him there .</l>
     <l n="1580">She wants our hens to be the best there are .</l>
     <l n="1581">You never saw this room before a show ,</l>
     <l n="1582">Full of lank , shivery , half-drowned birds</l>
     <l n="1583">In separate coops , having their plumage done .</l>
     <l n="1584">The smell of the wet feathers in the heat !</l>
     <l n="1585">You spoke of John 's not being safe to stay with .</l>
     <l n="1586">You do n't know what a gentle lot we are :</l>
     <l n="1587">We would n't hurt a hen ! You ought to see us</l>
     <l n="1588">Moving a flock of hens from place to place .</l>
     <l n="1589">We 're not allowed to take them upside down ,</l>
     <l n="1590">All we can hold together by the legs .</l>
     <l n="1591">Two at a time 's the rule , one on each arm ,</l>
     <l n="1592">No matter how far and how many times</l>
     <l n="1593">We have to go . ”</l>
     <l n="1594">“ You mean that 's John 's idea . ”</l>
     <l n="1595">“ And we live up to it ; or I do n't know</l>
     <l n="1596">What childishness he would n't give way to .</l>
     <l n="1597">He manages to keep the upper hand</l>
     <l n="1598">On his own farm . He 's boss . But as to hens :</l>
     <l n="1599">We fence our flowers in and the hens range .</l>
     <l n="1600">Nothing 's too good for them . We say it pays .</l>
     <l n="1601">John likes to tell the offers he has had ,</l>
     <l n="1602">Twenty for this cock , twenty-five for that .</l>
     <l n="1603">He never takes the money . If they 're worth</l>
     <l n="1604">That much to sell , they 're worth as much to keep .</l>
     <l n="1605">Bless you , it 's all expense , though . Reach me down</l>
     <l n="1606">The little tin box on the cupboard shelf ,</l>
     <l n="1607">The upper shelf , the tin box . That 's the one .</l>
     <l n="1608">I 'll show you . Here you are . ”</l>
     <l n="1609">“ What 's this ? ”</l>
     <l n="1610">“ A bill —</l>
     <l n="1611">For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock —</l>
     <l n="1612">Receipted . And the cock is in the yard . ”</l>
     <l n="1613">“ Not in a glass case , then ? ”</l>
     <l n="1614">“ He 'd need a tall one :</l>
     <l n="1615">He can eat off a barrel from the ground .</l>
     <l n="1616">He 's been in a glass case , as you may say ,</l>
     <l n="1617">The Crystal Palace , London . He 's imported .</l>
     <l n="1618">John bought him , and we paid the bill with beads —</l>
     <l n="1619">Wampum , I call it . Mind , we do n't complain .</l>
     <l n="1620">But you see , do n't you , we take care of him . ”</l>
     <l n="1621">“ And like it , too . It makes it all the worse . ”</l>
     <l n="1622">“ It seems as if . And that 's not all : he 's helpless</l>
     <l n="1623">In ways that I can hardly tell you of .</l>
     <l n="1624">Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts</l>
     <l n="1625">To see where all the money goes so fast .</l>
     <l n="1626">You know how men will be ridiculous .</l>
     <l n="1627">But it 's just fun the way he gets bedeviled —</l>
     <l n="1628">If he 's untidy now , what will he be ——?</l>
     <l n="1629">“ It makes it all the worse . You must be blind . ”</l>
     <l n="1630">“ Estelle 's the one . You need n't talk to me . ”</l>
     <l n="1631">“ Ca n't you and I get to the root of it ?</l>
     <l n="1632">What 's the real trouble ? What will satisfy her ? ”</l>
     <l n="1633">“ It 's as I say : she 's turned from him , that 's all . ”</l>
     <l n="1634">“ But why , when she 's well off ? Is it the neighbours ,</l>
     <l n="1635">Being cut off from friends ? ”</l>
     <l n="1636">“ We have our friends .</l>
     <l n="1637">That is n't it . Folks are n't afraid of us . ”</l>
     <l n="1638">“ She 's let it worry her . You stood the strain ,</l>
     <l n="1639">And you 're her mother . ”</l>
     <l n="1640">“ But I did n't always .</l>
     <l n="1641">I did n't relish it along at first .</l>
     <l n="1642">But I got wonted to it . And besides —</l>
     <l n="1643">John said I was too old to have grandchildren .</l>
     <l n="1644">But what 's the use of talking when it 's done ?</l>
     <l n="1645">She wo n't come back — it 's worse than that — she can n't . ”</l>
     <l n="1646">“ Why do you speak like that ? What do you know ?</l>
     <l n="1647">What do you mean ?— she 's done harm to herself ? ”</l>
     <l n="1648">“ I mean she 's married — married someone else . ”</l>
     <l n="1649">“ Oho , oho ! ”</l>
     <l n="1650">“ You do n't believe me . ”</l>
     <l n="1651">“ Yes , I do ,</l>
     <l n="1652">Only too well . I knew there must be something !</l>
     <l n="1653">So that was what was back . She 's bad , that 's all ! ”</l>
     <l n="1654">“ Bad to get married when she had the chance ? ”</l>
     <l n="1655">“ Nonsense ! See what 's she done ! But who , who —— ”</l>
     <l n="1656">“ Who 'd marry her straight out of such a mess ?</l>
     <l n="1657">Say it right out — no matter for her mother .</l>
     <l n="1658">The man was found . I 'd better name no names .</l>
     <l n="1659">John himself wo n't imagine who he is . ”</l>

     <l n="1661">You 'll be expecting John . I pity Estelle ;</l>
     <l n="1662">I suppose she deserves some pity , too .</l>
     <l n="1663">You ought to have the kitchen to yourself</l>
     <l n="1664">To break it to him . You may have the job . ”</l>
     <l n="1665">“ You need n't think you 're going to get away .</l>
     <l n="1666">John 's almost here . I 've had my eye on someone</l>
     <l n="1667">Coming down Ryan 's Hill . I thought ‘ twas him .</l>
     <l n="1668">Here he is now . This box ! Put it away .</l>
     <l n="1669">And this bill . ”</l>
     <l n="1670">“ What 's the hurry ? He 'll unhitch . ”</l>
     <l n="1671">“ No , he wo n't , either . He 'll just drop the reins</l>
     <l n="1672">And turn Doll out to pasture , rig and all .</l>
     <l n="1673">She wo n't get far before the wheels hang up</l>
     <l n="1674">On something — there 's no harm . See , there he is !</l>
     <l n="1675">My , but he looks as if he must have heard ! ”</l>
     <l n="1676">John threw the door wide but he did n't enter .</l>
     <l n="1677">“ How are you , neighbour ? Just the man I 'm after .</l>
     <l n="1678">Is n't it Hell , ” he said . “ I want to know .</l>
     <l n="1679">Come out here if you want to hear me talk .</l>
     <l n="1680">I 'll talk to you , old woman , afterward .</l>
     <l n="1681">I 've got some news that maybe is n't news .</l>
     <l n="1682">What are they trying to do to me , these two ? ”</l>
     <l n="1683">“ Do go along with him and stop his shouting . ”</l>
     <l n="1684">She raised her voice against the closing door :</l>

     <l n="1687">A LANTERN light from deeper in the barn</l>
     <l n="1688">Shone on a man and woman in the door</l>
     <l n="1689">And threw their lurching shadows on a house</l>
     <l n="1690">Near by , all dark in every glossy window .</l>
     <l n="1691">A horse 's hoof pawed once the hollow floor ,</l>
     <l n="1692">And the back of the gig they stood beside</l>
     <l n="1693">Moved in a little . The man grasped a wheel ,</l>
     <l n="1694">The woman spoke out sharply , “ Whoa , stand still ! ”</l>
     <l n="1695">“ I saw it just as plain as a white plate , ”</l>
     <l n="1696">She said , “ as the light on the dashboard ran</l>
     <l n="1697">Along the bushes at the roadside — a man 's face .</l>
     <l n="1698">You must have seen it too . ”</l>
     <l n="1699">“ I did n't see it .</l>
     <l n="1700">Are you sure —— ”</l>
     <l n="1701">“ Yes , I 'm sure ! ”</l>
     <l n="1702">“ — it was a face ? ”</l>
     <l n="1703">“ Joel , I 'll have to look . I can n't go in ,</l>
     <l n="1704">I can n't , and leave a thing like that unsettled .</l>
     <l n="1705">Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference .</l>
     <l n="1706">I always have felt strange when we came home</l>
     <l n="1707">To the dark house after so long an absence ,</l>
     <l n="1708">And the key rattled loudly into place</l>
     <l n="1709">Seemed to warn someone to be getting out</l>
     <l n="1710">At one door as we entered at another .</l>
     <l n="1711">What if I 'm right , and someone all the time —</l>
     <l n="1712">Do n't hold my arm ! ”</l>
     <l n="1713">“ I say it 's someone passing . ”</l>
     <l n="1714">“ You speak as if this were a travelled road .</l>
     <l n="1715">You forget where we are . What is beyond</l>
     <l n="1716">That he 'd be going to or coming from</l>
     <l n="1717">At such an hour of night , and on foot too .</l>
     <l n="1718">What was he standing still for in the bushes ? ”</l>
     <l n="1719">“ It 's not so very late — it 's only dark .</l>
     <l n="1720">There 's more in it than you 're inclined to say .</l>
     <l n="1721">Did he look like ——? ”</l>
     <l n="1722">“ He looked like anyone .</l>
     <l n="1723">I 'll never rest to-night unless I know .</l>
     <l n="1724">Give me the lantern . ”</l>
     <l n="1725">“ You do n't want the lantern . ”</l>
     <l n="1726">She pushed past him and got it for herself .</l>
     <l n="1727">“ You 're not to come , ” she said . “ This is my business .</l>
     <l n="1728">If the time 's come to face it , I 'm the one</l>
     <l n="1729">To put it the right way . He 'd never dare —</l>
     <l n="1730">Listen ! He kicked a stone . Hear that , hear that !</l>
     <l n="1731">He 's coming towards us . Joel , go in — please .</l>
     <l n="1732">Hark !— I do n't hear him now . But please go in . ”</l>
     <l n="1733">“ In the first place you can n't make me believe it 's —— ”</l>
     <l n="1734">“ It is — or someone else he 's sent to watch .</l>
     <l n="1735">And now 's the time to have it out with him</l>
     <l n="1736">While we know definitely where he is .</l>
     <l n="1737">Let him get off and he 'll be everywhere</l>
     <l n="1738">Around us , looking out of trees and bushes</l>
     <l n="1739">Till I sha'n ' t dare to set a foot outdoors .</l>
     <l n="1740">And I can n't stand it . Joel , let me go ! ”</l>
     <l n="1741">“ But it 's nonsense to think he 'd care enough . ”</l>
     <l n="1742">“ You mean you could n't understand his caring .</l>
     <l n="1743">Oh , but you see he had n't had enough —</l>
     <l n="1744">Joel , I wo n't — I wo n't — I promise you .</l>
     <l n="1745">We must n't say hard things . You must n't either . ”</l>
     <l n="1746">“ I 'll be the one , if anybody goes !</l>
     <l n="1747">But you give him the advantage with this light .</l>
     <l n="1748">What could n't he do to us standing here !</l>
     <l n="1749">And if to see was what he wanted , why</l>
     <l n="1750">He has seen all there was to see and gone . ”</l>
     <l n="1751">He appeared to forget to keep his hold ,</l>
     <l n="1752">But advanced with her as she crossed the grass .</l>
     <l n="1753">“ What do you want ? ” she cried to all the dark .</l>
     <l n="1754">She stretched up tall to overlook the light</l>
     <l n="1755">That hung in both hands hot against her skirt .</l>
     <l n="1756">“ There 's no one ; so you 're wrong , ” he said .</l>
     <l n="1757">“ There is .—</l>
     <l n="1758">What do you want ? ” she cried , and then herself</l>
     <l n="1759">Was startled when an answer really came .</l>
     <l n="1760">“ Nothing . ” It came from well along the road .</l>
     <l n="1761">She reached a hand to Joel for support :</l>
     <l n="1762">The smell of scorching woollen made her faint .</l>
     <l n="1763">“ What are you doing round this house at night ? ”</l>
     <l n="1764">“ Nothing . ” A pause : there seemed no more to say .</l>
     <l n="1765">And then the voice again : “ You seem afraid .</l>
     <l n="1766">I saw by the way you whipped up the horse .</l>
     <l n="1767">I 'll just come forward in the lantern light</l>
     <l n="1768">And let you see . ”</l>
     <l n="1769">“ Yes , do .— Joel , go back ! ”</l>
     <l n="1770">She stood her ground against the noisy steps</l>
     <l n="1771">That came on , but her body rocked a little .</l>
     <l n="1772">“ You see , ” the voice said .</l>
     <l n="1773">“ Oh . ” She looked and looked .</l>
     <l n="1774">“ You do n't see — I 've a child here by the hand . ”</l>
     <l n="1775">“ What 's a child doing at this time of night ——? ”</l>
     <l n="1776">“ Out walking . Every child should have the memory</l>
     <l n="1777">Of at least one long-after-bedtime walk .</l>
     <l n="1778">What , son ? ”</l>
     <l n="1779">“ Then I should think you 'd try to find</l>
     <l n="1780">Somewhere to walk —— ”</l>
     <l n="1781">“ The highway as it happens —</l>
     <l n="1782">We 're stopping for the fortnight down at Dean 's . ”</l>
     <l n="1783">“ But if that 's all — Joel — you realize —</l>
     <l n="1784">You wo n't think anything . You understand ?</l>
     <l n="1785">You understand that we have to be careful .</l>
     <l n="1786">This is a very , very lonely place .</l>
     <l n="1787">Joel ! ” She spoke as if she could n't turn .</l>
     <l n="1788">The swinging lantern lengthened to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="1789">It touched , it struck it , clattered and went out .</l>

     <l n="1793">I 'm going to sell my soul , or , rather , feet .</l>
     <l n="1794">Five hundred dollars for the pair , you know . ”</l>
     <l n="1795">“ With you the feet have nearly been the soul ;</l>

     <l n="1797">I want to see you do it . When 's he coming ? ”</l>

     <l n="1804">What does he think ?— How are the blessed feet ?</l>
     <l n="1805">The doctor 's sure you 're going to walk again ? ”</l>
     <l n="1806">“ He thinks I 'll hobble . It 's both legs and feet . ”</l>
     <l n="1807">“ They must be terrible — I mean to look at . ”</l>
     <l n="1808">“ I have n't dared to look at them uncovered .</l>

     <l n="1815">Or fumble for my knife to cut away ,</l>
     <l n="1816">I just embraced the shaft and rode it out —</l>
     <l n="1817">Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit .</l>
     <l n="1818">That 's how I think I did n't lose my head .</l>
     <l n="1819">But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling . ”</l>
     <l n="1820">“ Awful . Why did n't they throw off the belt</l>
     <l n="1821">Instead of going clear down in the wheel-pit ? ”</l>

     <l n="1823">Old streak of leather — does n't love me much</l>
     <l n="1824">Because I make him spit fire at my knuckles ,</l>
     <l n="1825">The way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string .</l>

     <l n="1828">He 's on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth</l>

     <l n="1850">“ Five hundred .</l>
     <l n="1851">Five hundred — five — five ! One , two , three , four , five .</l>

     <l n="1856">What I can get . You see they have the feet ,</l>
     <l n="1857">Which gives them the advantage in the trade .</l>
     <l n="1858">I can n't get back the feet in any case . ”</l>

     <l n="1862">For the next forty summers — call it forty .</l>
     <l n="1863">But I 'm not selling those , I 'm giving them ,</l>

     <l n="1866">No , the five hundred was the sum they named</l>
     <l n="1867">To pay the doctor 's bill and tide me over .</l>
     <l n="1868">It 's that or fight , and I do n't want to fight —</l>
     <l n="1869">I just want to get settled in my life ,</l>
     <l n="1870">Such as it 's going to be , and know the worst ,</l>
     <l n="1871">Or best — it may not be so bad . The firm</l>

     <l n="1873">“ But what about your flora of the valley ? ”</l>
     <l n="1874">“ You have me there . But that — you did n't think</l>
     <l n="1875">That was worth money to me ? Still I own</l>
     <l n="1876">It goes against me not to finish it</l>
     <l n="1877">For the friends it might bring me . By the way ,</l>
     <l n="1878">I had a letter from Burroughs — did I tell you ?—</l>
     <l n="1879">About my Cyprepedium reginæ ;</l>
     <l n="1880">He says it 's not reported so far north .</l>
     <l n="1881">There ! there 's the bell . He 's rung . But you go down</l>
     <l n="1882">And bring him up , and do n't let Mrs . Corbin .—</l>
     <l n="1883">Oh , well , we 'll soon be through with it . I 'm tired . ”</l>
     <l n="1884">Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer</l>
     <l n="1885">A little barefoot girl who in the noise</l>
     <l n="1886">Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house ,</l>
     <l n="1887">And baritone importance of the lawyer ,</l>
     <l n="1888">Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands</l>
     <l n="1889">Shyly behind her .</l>
     <l n="1890">“ Well , and how is Mister —— ”</l>
     <l n="1891">The lawyer was already in his satchel</l>
     <l n="1892">As if for papers that might bear the name</l>
     <l n="1893">He had n't at command . “ You must excuse me ,</l>
     <l n="1894">I dropped in at the mill and was detained . ”</l>
     <l n="1895">“ Looking round , I suppose , ” said Willis .</l>
     <l n="1896">“ Yes ,</l>
     <l n="1897">Well , yes . ”</l>
     <l n="1898">“ Hear anything that might prove useful ? ”</l>
     <l n="1899">The Broken One saw Anne . “ Why , here is Anne .</l>
     <l n="1900">What do you want , dear ? Come , stand by the bed ;</l>
     <l n="1901">Tell me what is it ? ” Anne just wagged her dress</l>
     <l n="1902">With both hands held behind her . “ Guess , ” she said .</l>
     <l n="1903">“ Oh , guess which hand ? My my ! Once on a time</l>
     <l n="1904">I knew a lovely way to tell for certain</l>
     <l n="1905">By looking in the ears . But I forget it .</l>
     <l n="1906">Er , let me see . I think I 'll take the right .</l>
     <l n="1907">That 's sure to be right even if it 's wrong .</l>
     <l n="1908">Come , hold it out . Do n't change .— A Ram 's Horn orchid !</l>
     <l n="1909">A Ram 's Horn ! What would I have got , I wonder ,</l>
     <l n="1910">If I had chosen left . Hold out the left .</l>
     <l n="1911">Another Ram 's Horn ! Where did you find those ,</l>
     <l n="1912">Under what beech tree , on what woodchuck 's knoll ? ”</l>
     <l n="1913">Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side ,</l>
     <l n="1914">And thought she would n't venture on so much .</l>
     <l n="1915">“ Were there no others ? ”</l>
     <l n="1916">“ There were four or five .</l>
     <l n="1917">I knew you would n't let me pick them all . ”</l>
     <l n="1918">“ I would n't — so I would n't . You 're the girl !</l>
     <l n="1919">You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart . ”</l>
     <l n="1920">“ I wanted there should be some there next year . ”</l>
     <l n="1921">“ Of course you did . You left the rest for seed ,</l>
     <l n="1922">And for the backwoods woodchuck . You 're the girl !</l>
     <l n="1923">A Ram 's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck</l>
     <l n="1924">Sounds something like . Better than farmer 's beans</l>
     <l n="1925">To a discriminating appetite ,</l>
     <l n="1926">Though the Ram 's Horn is seldom to be had</l>
     <l n="1927">In bushel lots — does n't come on the market .</l>
     <l n="1928">But , Anne , I 'm troubled ; have you told me all ?</l>
     <l n="1929">You 're hiding something . That 's as bad as lying .</l>
     <l n="1930">You ask this lawyer man . And it 's not safe</l>
     <l n="1931">With a lawyer at hand to find you out .</l>
     <l n="1932">Nothing is hidden from some people , Anne .</l>
     <l n="1933">You do n't tell me that where you found a Ram 's Horn</l>
     <l n="1934">You did n't find a Yellow Lady 's Slipper .</l>
     <l n="1935">What did I tell you ? What ? I 'd blush , I would .</l>
     <l n="1936">Do n't you defend yourself . If it was there ,</l>
     <l n="1937">Where is it now , the Yellow Lady 's Slipper ? ”</l>
     <l n="1938">“ Well , wait — it 's common — it 's too common . ”</l>
     <l n="1939">“ Common ?</l>
     <l n="1940">The Purple Lady 's Slipper 's commoner . ”</l>
     <l n="1941">“ I did n't bring a Purple Lady 's Slipper</l>
     <l n="1942">To You — to you I mean — they 're both too common . ”</l>
     <l n="1943">The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers</l>
     <l n="1944">As if with some idea that she had scored .</l>
     <l n="1945">“ I 've broken Anne of gathering bouquets .</l>
     <l n="1946">It 's not fair to the child . It can n't be helped though :</l>
     <l n="1947">Pressed into service means pressed out of shape .</l>
     <l n="1948">Somehow I 'll make it right with her — she 'll see .</l>
     <l n="1949">She 's going to do my scouting in the field ,</l>
     <l n="1950">Over stone walls and all along a wood</l>
     <l n="1951">And by a river bank for water flowers ,</l>
     <l n="1952">The floating Heart , with small leaf like a heart ,</l>
     <l n="1953">And at the sinus under water a fist</l>
     <l n="1954">Of little fingers all kept down but one ,</l>
     <l n="1955">And that thrust up to blossom in the sun</l>
     <l n="1956">As if to say , ‘ You ! You 're the Heart 's desire . ’</l>
     <l n="1957">Anne has a way with flowers to take the place</l>
     <l n="1958">Of that she 's lost : she goes down on one knee</l>
     <l n="1959">And lifts their faces by the chin to hers</l>
     <l n="1960">And says their names , and leaves them where they are . ”</l>
     <l n="1961">The lawyer wore a watch the case of which</l>
     <l n="1962">Was cunningly devised to make a noise</l>
     <l n="1963">Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut</l>
     <l n="1964">At such a time as this . He snapped it now .</l>
     <l n="1965">“ Well , Anne , go , dearie . Our affair will wait .</l>
     <l n="1966">The lawyer man is thinking of his train .</l>
     <l n="1967">He wants to give me lots and lots of money</l>
     <l n="1968">Before he goes , because I hurt myself ,</l>
     <l n="1969">And it may take him I do n't know how long .</l>
     <l n="1970">But put our flowers in water first . Will , help her :</l>
     <l n="1971">The pitcher 's too full for her . There 's no cup ?</l>
     <l n="1972">Just hook them on the inside of the pitcher .</l>
     <l n="1973">Now run .— Get out your documents ! You see</l>
     <l n="1974">I have to keep on the good side of Anne .</l>
     <l n="1975">I 'm a great boy to think of number one .</l>
     <l n="1976">And you can n't blame me in the place I 'm in .</l>
     <l n="1977">Who will take care of my necessities</l>
     <l n="1978">Unless I do ? ”</l>
     <l n="1979">“ A pretty interlude , ”</l>
     <l n="1980">The lawyer said . “ I 'm sorry , but my train —</l>
     <l n="1981">Luckily terms are all agreed upon .</l>
     <l n="1982">You only have to sign your name . Right — there . ”</l>
     <l n="1983">“ You , Will , stop making faces . Come round here</l>
     <l n="1984">Where you can n't make them . What is it you want ?</l>
     <l n="1985">I 'll put you out with Anne . Be good or go . ”</l>
     <l n="1986">“ You do n't mean you will sign that thing unread ? ”</l>
     <l n="1987">“ Make yourself useful then , and read it for me .</l>
     <l n="1988">Is n't it something I have seen before ? ”</l>
     <l n="1989">“ You 'll find it is . Let your friend look at it . ”</l>
     <l n="1990">“ Yes , but all that takes time , and I 'm as much</l>
     <l n="1991">In haste to get it over with as you .</l>
     <l n="1992">But read it , read it . That 's right , draw the curtain :</l>
     <l n="1993">Half the time I do n't know what 's troubling me .—</l>
     <l n="1994">What do you say , Will ? Do n't you be a fool ,</l>
     <l n="1995">You ! crumpling folkses legal documents .</l>
     <l n="1996">Out with it if you 've any real objection . ”</l>
     <l n="1997">“ Five hundred dollars ! ”</l>
     <l n="1998">“ What would you think right ? ”</l>
     <l n="1999">“ A thousand would n't be a cent too much ;</l>
     <l n="2000">You know it , Mr. Lawyer . The sin is</l>
     <l n="2001">Accepting anything before he knows</l>
     <l n="2002">Whether he 's ever going to walk again .</l>
     <l n="2003">It smells to me like a dishonest trick . ”</l>
     <l n="2004">“ I think — I think — from what I heard to-day —</l>
     <l n="2005">And saw myself — he would be ill-advised —— ”</l>
     <l n="2006">“ What did you hear , for instance ? ” Willis said .</l>
     <l n="2007">“ Now the place where the accident occurred —— ”</l>
     <l n="2008">The Broken One was twisted in his bed .</l>
     <l n="2009">“ This is between you two apparently .</l>
     <l n="2010">Where I come in is what I want to know .</l>
     <l n="2011">You stand up to it like a pair of cocks .</l>
     <l n="2012">Go outdoors if you want to fight . Spare me .</l>
     <l n="2013">When you come back , I 'll have the papers signed .</l>
     <l n="2014">Will pencil do ? Then , please , your fountain pen .</l>
     <l n="2015">One of you hold my head up from the pillow . ”</l>
     <l n="2016">Willis flung off the bed . “ I wash my hands —</l>
     <l n="2017">I 'm no match — no , and do n't pretend to be —— ”</l>
     <l n="2018">The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen .</l>
     <l n="2019">“ You 're doing the wise thing : you wo n't regret it .</l>
     <l n="2020">We 're very sorry for you . ”</l>
     <l n="2021">Willis sneered :</l>
     <l n="2022">“ Who 's we ?— some stockholders in Boston ?</l>
     <l n="2023">I 'll go outdoors , by gad , and wo n't come back . ”</l>
     <l n="2024">“ Willis , bring Anne back with you when you come .</l>
     <l n="2025">Yes . Thanks for caring . Do n't mind Will : he 's savage .</l>
     <l n="2026">He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers .</l>
     <l n="2027">You do n't know what I mean about the flowers .</l>
     <l n="2028">Do n't stop to try to now . You 'll miss your train .</l>
     <l n="2029">Good-bye . ” He flung his arms around his face .</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="2031">OUT walking in the frozen swamp one grey day</l>
     <l n="2032">I paused and said , “ I will turn back from here .</l>
     <l n="2033">No , I will go on farther — and we shall see . ”</l>
     <l n="2034">The hard snow held me , save where now and then</l>
     <l n="2035">One foot went down . The view was all in lines</l>
     <l n="2036">Straight up and down of tall slim trees</l>
     <l n="2037">Too much alike to mark or name a place by</l>
     <l n="2038">So as to say for certain I was here</l>
     <l n="2039">Or somewhere else : I was just far from home .</l>
     <l n="2040">A small bird flew before me . He was careful</l>
     <l n="2041">To put a tree between us when he lighted ,</l>
     <l n="2042">And say no word to tell me who he was</l>
     <l n="2043">Who was so foolish as to think what he thought .</l>
     <l n="2044">He thought that I was after him for a feather —</l>
     <l n="2045">The white one in his tail ; like one who takes</l>
     <l n="2046">Everything said as personal to himself .</l>
     <l n="2047">One flight out sideways would have undeceived him .</l>
     <l n="2048">And then there was a pile of wood for which</l>
     <l n="2049">I forgot him and let his little fear</l>
     <l n="2050">Carry him off the way I might have gone ,</l>
     <l n="2051">Without so much as wishing him good-night .</l>
     <l n="2052">He went behind it to make his last stand .</l>
     <l n="2053">It was a cord of maple , cut and split</l>
     <l n="2054">And piled — and measured , four by four by eight .</l>
     <l n="2055">And not another like it could I see .</l>
     <l n="2056">No runner tracks in this year 's snow looped near it .</l>
     <l n="2057">And it was older sure than this year 's cutting ,</l>
     <l n="2058">Or even last year 's or the year 's before .</l>
     <l n="2059">The wood was grey and the bark warping off it</l>
     <l n="2060">And the pile somewhat sunken . Clematis</l>
     <l n="2061">Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle .</l>
     <l n="2062">What held it though on one side was a tree</l>
     <l n="2063">Still growing , and on one a stake and prop ,</l>
     <l n="2064">These latter about to fall . I thought that only</l>
     <l n="2065">Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks</l>
     <l n="2066">Could so forget his handiwork on which</l>
     <l n="2067">He spent himself , the labour of his axe ,</l>
     <l n="2068">And leave it there far from a useful fireplace</l>
     <l n="2069">To warm the frozen swamp as best it could</l>
     <l n="2070">With the slow smokeless burning of decay .</l>

     <l n="2073">No one at all with whom to talk ,</l>
     <l n="2074">But I had the cottages in a row</l>
     <l n="2075">Up to their shining eyes in snow .</l>
     <l n="2076">And I thought I had the folk within :</l>
     <l n="2077">I had the sound of a violin ;</l>
     <l n="2078">I had a glimpse through curtain laces</l>
     <l n="2079">Of youthful forms and youthful faces .</l>
     <l n="2080">I had such company outward bound .</l>
     <l n="2081">I went till there were no cottages found .</l>
     <l n="2082">I turned and repented , but coming back</l>
     <l n="2083">I saw no window but that was black .</l>
     <l n="2084">Over the snow my creaking feet</l>
     <l n="2085">Disturbed the slumbering village street</l>
     <l n="2086">Like profanation , by your leave ,</l>
     <l n="2087">At ten o'clock of a winter eve .</l>
