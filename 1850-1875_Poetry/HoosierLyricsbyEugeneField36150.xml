   <div type="introduction">
    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">From whatever point of view the character of Eugene Field is seen , genius — rare and quaint presents itself in childlike simplicity . That he was a poet of keen perception , of rare discrimination , all will admit . He was a humorist as delicate and fanciful as Artemus Ward , Mark Twain , Bill Nye , James Whitcomb Riley , Opie Read , or Bret Harte in their happiest moods . Within him ran a poetic vein , capable of being worked in any direction , and from which he could , at will , extract that which his imagination saw and felt most . That he occasionally left the child-world , in which he longed to linger , to wander among the older children of men , where intuitively the hungry listener follows him into his Temple of Mirth , all should rejoice , for those who knew him not , can while away the moments imbibing the genius of his imagination in the poetry and prose here presented .</p>
    <p n="2">Though never possessing an intimate acquaintanceship with Field , owing largely to the disparity in our ages , still there existed a bond of friendliness that renders my good opinion of him in a measure trustworthy . Born in the same city , both students in the same college , engaged at various times in newspaper work both in St. Louis and Chicago , residents of the same ward , with many mutual friends , it is not surprising that I am able to say of him that “ the world is better off that he lived , not in gold and silver or precious jewels , but in the bestowal of priceless truths , of which the possessor of this book becomes a benefactor of no mean share of his estate . ”</p>
    <p n="3">Every lover of Field , whether of the songs of childhood or the poems that lend mirth to the out-pouring of his poetic nature , will welcome this unique collection of his choicest wit and humor .</p>
    <p n="4">CHARLES WALTER Brown .</p>

    <head>OUR LADY OF THE MINE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Blue Horizon wuz a mine us fellers all thought well uv ,</l>
     <l n="2">And there befell the episode I now perpose to tell uv ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Twuz in the year of sixty-nine — somewhere along in summer —</l>
     <l n="4">There hove in sight one afternoon a new and curious comer ;</l>
     <l n="5">His name wuz Silas Pettibone — an artist by perfession ,</l>
     <l n="6">With a kit of tools and a big mustache and a pipe in his possession ;</l>
     <l n="7">He told us , by our leave , he 'd kind uv like to make some sketches</l>
     <l n="8">Uv the snowy peaks , ‘ nd the foamin ’ crick , ‘ nd the distant mountain</l>
     <l n="9">stretches ;</l>
     <l n="10">“ You 're welkim , sir , ” sez we , although this scenery dodge seemed to us</l>
     <l n="11">A waste uv time where scenery wuz already sooper-floo-us .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">All through the summer Pettibone kep ’ busy at his sketchin ’ —</l>
     <l n="13">At daybreak , off for Eagle Pass , and home at nightfall , fetchin ’</l>
     <l n="14">That everlastin ’ book uv his with spider lines all through it —</l>
     <l n="15">Three-Fingered Hoover used to say there war n't no meanin ’ to it —</l>
     <l n="16">“ God durn a man , ” sez he to him , “ whose shif'less hand is sot at</l>
     <l n="17">A-drawin ’ hills that 's full of quartz that 's pinin ’ to be got at ! ”</l>
     <l n="18">“ Go on , ” sez Pettibone , “ go on , if joshin ’ gratifies ye ,</l>
     <l n="19">But one uv these fine times , I 'll show ye sumthin ’ will surprise ye ! ”</l>
     <l n="20">The which remark led us to think — although he did n't say it —</l>
     <l n="21">That Pettibone wuz owin ’ us a gredge ‘ nd meant to pay it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="22">One evenin ’ as we sat around the restauraw de Casey ,</l>
     <l n="23">A-singin ’ songs ‘ nd tellin ’ yarns the which wuz sumwhat racy ,</l>
     <l n="24">In come that feller Pettibone ‘ nd sez : “ With your permission</l>
     <l n="25">I 'd like to put a picture I have made on exhibition . ”</l>
     <l n="26">He sot the picture on the bar ‘ nd drew aside its curtain ,</l>
     <l n="27">Sayin ': “ I recken you 'll allow as how that 's art , f'r certain ! ”</l>
     <l n="28">And then we looked , with jaws agape , but nary word wuz spoken ,</l>
     <l n="29">And f'r a likely spell the charm uv silence wuz unbroken —</l>
     <l n="30">Till presently , as in a dream , remarked Three-Fingered Hoover :</l>
     <l n="31">“ Onless I am mistaken , this is Pettibone 's shef doover ! ”</l>
     <l n="32">It wuz a face , a human face — a woman 's , fair ‘ nd tender ,</l>
     <l n="33">Sot gracefully upon a neck white as a swan 's , and slender ;</l>
     <l n="34">The hair wuz kind of sunny , ‘ nd the eyes wuz sort uv dreamy ,</l>
     <l n="35">The mouth wuz half a-smilin ’ , ‘ nd the cheeks wuz soft ‘ nd creamy ;</l>
     <l n="36">It seemed like she wuz lookin ’ off into the west out yonder ,</l>
     <l n="37">And seemed like , while she looked , we saw her eyes grow softer ,</l>
     <l n="38">fonder —</l>
     <l n="39">Like , lookin ’ off into the west where mountain mists wuz fallin ’ ,</l>
     <l n="40">She saw the face she longed to see and heerd his voice a-callin ’ ;</l>
     <l n="41">“ Hooray ! ” we cried ; “ a woman in the camp uv Blue Horizon —</l>
     <l n="42">Step right up , Colonel Pettibone , ‘ nd nominate your pizen ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="43">A curious situation — one deservin ’ uv your pity —</l>
     <l n="44">No human , livin ’ female thing this side of Denver City !</l>
     <l n="45">But jest a lot uv husky men that lived on sand ‘ nd bitters —</l>
     <l n="46">Do you wonder that that woman 's face consoled the lonesome critters ?</l>
     <l n="47">And not a one but what it served in some way to remind him</l>
     <l n="48">Of a mother or a sister or a sweetheart left behind him —</l>
     <l n="49">And some looked back on happier days and saw the old-time faces</l>
     <l n="50">And heerd the dear familiar sounds in old familiar places —</l>
     <l n="51">A gracious touch of home — “ Look here , ” sez Hoover , “ ever'body</l>
     <l n="52">Quit thinkin ’ ‘ nd perceed at oncet to name his favorite toddy ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="53">It wuz n't long afore the news had spread the country over ,</l>
     <l n="54">And miners come a-flockin ’ in like honey bees to clover ;</l>
     <l n="55">It kind uv did ‘ em good they said , to feast their hungry eyes on</l>
     <l n="56">That picture uv Our Lady in the camp uv Blue Horizon .</l>
     <l n="57">But one mean cuss from Nigger Crick passed criticisms on ‘ er —</l>
     <l n="58">Leastwise we overheerd him call her Pettibone 's madonner ,</l>
     <l n="59">The which we did not take to be respectful to a lady —</l>
     <l n="60">So we hung him in a quiet spot that wuz cool ‘ nd dry ‘ nd shady ;</l>
     <l n="61">Which same might not have been good law , but it wuz the right</l>
     <l n="62">maneuver</l>
     <l n="63">To give the critics due respect for Pettibone 's shef doover .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="64">Gone is the camp — yes , years ago , the Blue Horizon busted ,</l>
     <l n="65">And every mother 's son uv us got up one day ‘ nd dusted ,</l>
     <l n="66">While Pettibone perceeded east with wealth in his possession</l>
     <l n="67">And went to Yurrup , as I heerd , to study his perfession ;</l>
     <l n="68">So , like as not , you 'll find him now a-paintin ’ heads ‘ nd faces</l>
     <l n="69">At Venus , Billy Florence and the like I-talyun places —</l>
     <l n="70">But no such face he 'll paint again as at old Blue Horizon ,</l>
     <l n="71">For I 'll allow no sweeter face no human soul sot eyes on ;</l>
     <l n="72">And when the critics talk so grand uv Paris ‘ nd the loover ,</l>
     <l n="73">I say : “ Oh , but you orter seen the Pettibone shef doover ! ”</l>

    <head>HIS QUEEN .</head>
    <head>Our gifted and genial friend , Mr. William J. Florence , the comedian , takes to verses as naturally as a canvas-back duck takes to celery sauce . As a balladist he has few equals and no superiors , and when it comes to weaving compliments to the gentler sex he is without a peer . We find in the New York Mirror the latest verses from Mr. Florence 's pen ; they are entitled “ Pasadene , ” and the first stanza flows in this wise :</head>
     <l n="1">I 've journeyed East , I 've journeyed West ,</l>
     <l n="2">And fair Italia 's fields I 've seen ;</l>
     <l n="3">But I declare</l>
     <l n="4">None can compare</l>
     <l n="5">With thee , my rose-crowned Pasadene .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Following this introduction come five stanzas heaping even more glowing compliments upon this Miss Pasadene — whoever she may be — we know her not . They are handsome compliments , beautifully phrased , yet they give us the heartache , for we know Mrs. Florence , and it grieves us to see her husband dribbling away his superb intellect in penning verses to other women . Yet we think we understand it all ; these poets have a pretty way of hymning the virtues of their wives under divers aliases . So , catching the afflatus of the genial actor-poet 's muse , we would answer :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Come , now , who is this Pasadene</l>
     <l n="2">That such a whirl of praises warrant ?</l>

     <l n="4">When I rambled home at nightfall with the puny string I 'd caught !</l>

     <l n="10">I never lost a little fish — yes , I am free to say</l>
     <l n="11">It always was the biggest fish I caught that got away .</l>
     <l n="12">And so it was , when , later on , I felt ambition pass</l>

     <l n="14">I found it quite convenient , when the beauties would n't bite</l>
     <l n="15">And I returned all bootless from the watery chase at night ,</l>

    <head>The Cleveland Leader must be getting ready for the campaign of 1888 . We find upon its editorial page quite a pretentious poem , entitled “ Alpha and Omega , ” and here is a sample stanza :</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Whose name will stand for coming time</l>
     <l n="2">As hypocrites in prose and rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="3">And be despised in every clime ?</l>
     <l n="4">The Mugwumps . ”</l>

     <l n="5">Well , may be so , but may we be permitted to add a stanza which seems to</l>
     <l n="6">us to be very pertinent just now ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">And who next year , we 'd like to know ,</l>
     <l n="8">Will feed the Cleveland Leader crow ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A boy came racing down the street</l>
     <l n="2">In a most tumultuous way ,</l>
     <l n="3">And he hollered at all he chanced to meet :</l>
     <l n="4">“ Hooray , hooray , hooray ! ”</l>
     <l n="5">His eyes and his breath were hot with joy</l>
     <l n="6">And his cheeks were all aflame —</l>

     <l n="9">“ Twenty to 6 ” and “ 10 to 2 ”</l>
     <l n="10">Were rather dismal scores ,</l>
     <l n="11">And they wreathed in a somewhat somber hue</l>
     <l n="12">These classic western shores ;</l>
     <l n="13">We shuddered and winced at the cruel sport</l>
     <l n="14">And our heads were bowed in shame</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Till Somewhere sent us the glad report</l>
     <l n="16">That the champions won the game !</l>

     <l n="17">Our Baby says it 'll be all right</l>
     <l n="18">For the champions by and by ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the twin emotions of Hope and Fright</l>
     <l n="20">Gleam in his cod fish eye ;</l>
     <l n="21">And Spalding says ( in his modest way )</l>
     <l n="22">That we 'll get there all the same ;</l>
     <l n="23">So let us holler , “ Hooray , hooray , ”</l>
     <l n="24">When the champions win the game .</l>

     <l n="1">In the market of Clare , so cheery the glare</l>

     <l n="3">That I take a delight , on a Saturday night ,</l>
     <l n="4">In walking that way and viewing the sight ;</l>
     <l n="5">For it 's here that one sees all the objects that please —</l>
     <l n="6">New patterns in silk and old patterns in cheese ,</l>

     <l n="13">He seems to despise the grandiloquent cries</l>
     <l n="14">Of the vender proclaiming his puddings and pies ;</l>
     <l n="15">And sniffing he goes through the lanes that disclose</l>
     <l n="16">Much cause for disgust to his sensitive nose ;</l>
     <l n="17">Once free from the crowd , he admits that he is proud</l>
     <l n="18">That elsewhere in London this thing 's not allowed —</l>
     <l n="19">He has seen nothing there but filth everywhere ,</l>

     <l n="1">My Uncle Ephraim was a man who did not live in vain ,</l>

     <l n="7">He never made a famous speech or did a thing of note ,</l>

     <l n="12">He tipped to poor and rich alike a genial “ how-dy ’ - do ” ;</l>

     <l n="22">Yes , he was brainy ; yet his life was hardly a success —</l>
     <l n="23">He was too honest and too smart for this vain world , I guess !</l>
     <l n="24">At any rate , I wondered he was unsuccessful when</l>

     <l n="26">When Uncle Eph was dying he called me to his bed ,</l>

     <l n="29">I fain would breathe a secret in your adolescent ear ;</l>
     <l n="30">Strive not to hew your way through life — it really does n't pay ;</l>
     <l n="31">Be sure the salve of flattery soaps all you do and say !</l>
     <l n="32">Herein the only royal road to fame and fortune lies ;</l>
