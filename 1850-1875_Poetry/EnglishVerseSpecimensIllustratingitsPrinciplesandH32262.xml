    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The aim of this book is to give the materials for the inductive study of English verse . Its origin was in certain university courses , for which it proved to be necessary — often for use in a single hour 's work — to gather almost numberless books , some of which must ordinarily be inaccessible except in the vicinity of large libraries . I have tried to extract from these books the materials necessary for the study of English verse-forms , adding notes designed to make the specimens intelligible and useful .</p>
    <p n="2">Dealing with a subject where theories are almost as numerous as those who have written on it , it has been my purpose to avoid the setting forth of my own opinions , and to present the subject-matter in a way suited , so far as possible , to the use of those holding widely divergent views . In the arrangement and naming of the earlier sections of the book , some systematic theory of the subject — accepted at least tentatively — was indeed indispensable ; but I trust that even here those who would apply to English verse a different classification or terminology may be able to discard what they cannot approve and to make use of the specimens from their own standpoint . Even where ( as in these introductory sections ) the notes seem to overtop the text somewhat threateningly , they are invariably intended — as the type indicates — to be subordinate . Where it has been possible to do so , I have preferred to present comments on the specimens in the words of other writers , and have not confined these notes to opinions with which I wholly agree , but only to those which seem worthy of attention . My own views on the more disputed elements of the subject ( such as the relations of time and accent in our verse , the presence of “ quantity ” in English , and the terminology of the subject ) I have reserved for Part Three , where I trust they will be found helpful by some readers , but where they may easily be passed over .</p>
    <p n="3">To classify the materials of this subject is peculiarly difficult , and one who tries to solve the problem will early abandon the hope of being able to follow any system with consistency . Main divisions and subdivisions will inevitably conflict and overlap . For practical purposes , basing my arrangement in part on that found convenient in university lectures ( which it will be seen is not altogether unlike that followed by Schipper in his Englische Metrik ) , I have divided the specimens of verse into two main divisions , each of which is suggested by a word in the sub-title of the book . Part One contains specimens designed to illustrate the principles of English verse , arranged in topical order . Part Two contains specimens designed to illustrate the history of the more important forms of English verse , arranged — in the several divisions — in chronological order . Part Three has already been spoken of . Part Four contains extracts from important critical writers on the place and function of the verse-element in poetry ,— matters which give us the raison d'être for the whole study of versification .</p>

    <docImprint>If there had ever been hope of making the collection of specimens fairly complete , even in a representative sense , this would have been dissipated by the discovery , during the very time of the book 's going through the press , of a number of additional specimens which it seemed wicked to omit . Doubtless every reader will miss some favorite selection which might well have been included , and suggestions as to important omissions will be received gratefully . The attempt has been to put students on the track of all the more important lines of development of English verse , and to indicate , by including a considerable number of specimens from early periods , the continuity of this development from the times of our Saxon forefathers to our own . Little consistency can be claimed for the practice observed in the matter of modernizing texts that date from transition periods like the sixteenth century . In some cases the text has been modernized , or retained in its original form , according as it seemed well to emphasize either the permanent significance or the historical position of the specimen in question . In other cases the form of the text was determined merely by the best edition accessible for purposes of reproduction . Dates have been appended to the specimens in those sections where chronology is a significant element . It has not always been possible to verify these dates with thoroughness , or to distinguish between the date of writing and that of publication ; but it is hoped that inaccuracies of this sort will at least not be found of a character to misrepresent the historical relations of the specimens . Dates are not ordinarily given for the poems of writers still living . In the notes on the specimens I have tried to distinguish between material likely to be useful for all students of the subject and that going more into detail , which is intended only for advanced or special students . Notes of the second class are printed in smaller type . There has been no attempt to give the notes of a bibliographical character any pretension to completeness . One may well hesitate to add , in this direction , to the admirable material presented in the Methods and Materials of Literary Criticism of Professors Gayley and Scott . I have resisted strenuously all temptation to choose or to annotate specimens on general grounds of æsthetic enjoyment , apart from the distinct study of verse-forms . Yet it would be useless to deny having sometimes made choice of particular verses , all other considerations being equal , for their poetic or literary value over and above their prosodical . I shall not claim for the collection what Boswell did for Dr. Johnson 's Dictionary , that “ he was so attentive in the choice ” of the illustrative passages “ that one may read page after page ... with improvement and pleasure ; ” yet I may say that , so far from fearing that the enjoyment of any poem will be injured by a proper attention to the elements of its metrical form , it is my hope that many a haunting verse may linger , a perpetual possession of beauty , in the memory of the student who first found it here classified under a technical name . Many obligations are to be acknowledged to scholars of whose advice I have availed myself . Most kindly aid has been received from Professor G. L. Kittredge and Dr. Fred N. Robinson , of Harvard University ; from Professor Felix E. Schelling , of the University of Pennsylvania ; from my friend , Mr. H. P. Earle , of Stanford University ; and from my colleague , Dr. Ewald Flügel . My obligation to Schipper 's monumental works on English verse will be obvious to every scholar . They suggested many of the specimens of verse-forms , and are also represented by translations or paraphrases in the notes ; references to Schipper , without full title , are to the Englische Metrik ,— the larger work . I have also made thankful use of Mr. John Addington Symonds 's essays on Blank Verse , and of Professor Corson 's Primer of English Verse ,— both somewhat unscientific but highly suggestive works . The section on Artificial French Forms obviously owes very much to Mr. Gleeson White 's Ballades and Rondeaus . A book to which my obligation is out of all proportion to the number of actual quotations from it is Mr. J . B . Mayor 's Chapters on English Metre . This modest but satisfying volume seemed to me , when I first was taking up the study of English verse , to be a grateful relief from the thorny and often fruitless discussions with which the subject had been overgrown ; and in returning to it again and again , I have never failed to renew the impression . Its suggestions underlie a good part of the system of classification and terminology adopted for this book . The new and enlarged edition came to hand too late for use , but I was able to include references to it in the notes . I must also record thanks to those authors and publishers who have courteously given permission for the reproduction of their publications : to Mr. John Lane , for permission to quote from the works of Mr. William Watson and Mr. Stephen Phillips ; to Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin and Company , for permission to make extracts from the poems of Mr. William Vaughn Moody and from Mr. Stedman 's Nature and Elements of Poetry ; to Macmillan and Company , Limited , of<settlement>London</settlement>, for permission to make extracts from Professor Butcher 's Aristotle 's Theory of Poetry and from Mr. Courthope 's Life in Poetry and Law in Taste ; to Professor F. B. Gummere and The Macmillan Company of<settlement>New York</settlement>, for permission to quote from the former 's Beginnings of Poetry ; to the Lothrop Publishing Company of<settlement>Boston</settlement>, for permission to reprint Mr. Clinton Scollard 's villanelle , “ Spring Knocks at Winter 's Frosty Door , ” from the volume entitled With Reed and Lyre ; to Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman , for permission to reprint her rondeau , “ A Man must Live , ” from the volume entitled On This Our World ( published by Small , Maynard and Company ) ; to Dr. Samuel Minturn Peck , for permission to reprint one of the triolets called “ Under the Rose , ” from his volume entitled Cap and Bells ; to the Frederick A. Stokes Company , for permission to reprint Mr. Frank D. Sherman 's “ Ballade to Austin Dobson , ” from the volume entitled Madrigals and Catches . Dr. S. Weir Mitchell , Mr. W. E. Henley , and Mr. Edmund Gosse have given generous permission to quote freely from their poems . Mr. Henley was also good enough to suggest the choice of the rondeau from his “ Bric-à-Brac ” ; and Mr. Gosse , whose unfailing courtesy follows up his numerous published aids to students of English poetry , has also added some personal notes on the history of the heroic couplet . Finally , it should be said that a considerable part of the studies resulting in this book was carried on while the editor held the Senior Fellowship in English on the Harrison Foundation in the University of Pennsylvania . If , therefore , the book should prove of service to any , the fact will be a single additional tribute to the munificence of that foundation . R. M. A.

    <p>I . ACCENT AND TIME</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>A .— KINDS OF ACCENT</head>
    <head>The accents of English syllables as appearing in verse are commonly classified in two ways : according to degree of intensity , and according to cause or significance .</head>
    <head>Obviously there can be no fixed limits to the number of degrees of intensity recognized in syllabic accent or stress . It is common to speak of three such degrees : syllables having accent ( stressed ) , syllables having secondary accent , and syllables without accent ( unstressed ) . Schipper makes four groups : Principal Accent ( Hauptaccent or Hochton ) , Secondary Accent ( Nebenaccent or Tiefton ) , No Accent ( Tonlosigkeit ) , and Disappearance of Sound ( Stummheit ) . In illustration he gives the word ponderous , where the first syllable has the chief accent , the last a secondary accent , the second no accent ; while in the verse</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Most ponderous and substantial things ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">the second syllable is suppressed or silent .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Mr. A. J. Ellis , in like manner , recognized three principal classes of syllables : those stressed in the first degree , those stressed in the second degree , and those unstressed .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In the following lines from Paradise Lost he indicated these three degrees , as he recognized them , by the figures 2 , 1 , 0 , written underneath .</p>
   <p>Of man 's first disobedience , and the fruit 0 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 2</p>
   <p>Of that forbidden tree , whose mortal taste 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 2</p>
   <p>Brought death into the world , and all our woe , 1 2 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 2</p>
   <p>With loss of Eden , till one greater man 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 2</p>
   <p>Restore us , and regain the blissful seat , 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2</p>
   <p>Sing , heavenly Muse , that , on the secret top 2 2 0 2 1 0 0 2 0 1</p>
   <p>Of Horeb or of Sinai , didst inspire 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 2</p>
   <p>That shepherd , who first taught the chosen seed 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 2 0 2</p>
   <p>In the beginning , how the heavens and earth 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 2</p>
   <p>Rose out of chaos .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>2 0 0 2 0</p>
   <p>It is worthy of note that the secondary accent seems originally to have been a more important factor in English verse than it is commonly considered to be in modern periods . In Anglo-Saxon verse the combination of a primary stress , a secondary stress , and an unstressed syllable , is a recognized type . In modern verse the reader is likely to make an effort to reduce all syllables to the type of either stress or no-stress . In such a verse as the following , however ( from Matthew Arnold 's Forsaken Merman ) ,—</p>
   <p>“ And I lose my poor soul , Merman , here with thee , ” —</p>
   <p>we may find such a combination as that just referred to as familiar in Anglo-Saxon rhythm . The syllables “ soul , Merman ” are respectively cases of primary stress , secondary stress , and no-stress . On this matter see further the remark of Luick , cited on p. 156 , below .</p>
   <p>The element of Pitch is not ordinarily included in the treatment of versification , as it is not ordinarily recognized as having any significance peculiar to verse . According to Professor J. W. Bright , however , there is such a thing as a “ pitch-accent ” which plays an important part in verse where the word-accent conflicts with that of the regular metre . Under certain exigencies , he says , “ un-governed , pre-cisely , re-markable , and Je-rusalem ... are naturally pronounced with a pitch-accent upon the first syllables , and with the undisturbed expiratory word-accent upon the second . It will of course be understood that when the word-accent is defined as expiratory this term does not exclude the inherent pitch of English stress . Force , quantity , and pitch are combined in our word-stress ( or word-accent ) , both primary and secondary ; but in the secondary stress used as ictus there is a noticeable change in the proportions of these elements , the pitch being relatively increased . An answer is thus won for the question : How do we naturally pronounce two stresses in juxtaposition on the same word , or on adjacent words closely joined grammatically ? This is further illustrated in the specially emphasized words of such expressions as ‘ The idea ! ’ ” where Professor Bright marks the pitch-accent on the first syllable of “ idea , ” retaining the stress-accent on the second syllable . In the line</p>
   <p>“ Of man 's first disobedience , and the fruit ”</p>
   <p>he marks a pitch-accent where the word-stress and metrical stress are in conflict , that is , on the syllables “ dis - ” and “ and . ” “ The rhythmic use of ‘ disobedience , ’ ” he says , “ illustrates with its four syllables ( as here used ) as many recognizable varieties of stress . The first syllable has a secondary word-accent , raised to a pitch-accent for ictus ; the second is wholly unaccented ; the third has the chief word-accent , employed as ictus ( the accent of the preceding word , “ first , ” is subordinate to the rhythm ) ; the fourth has a secondary word-accent which remains unchanged in the thesis . ” The conclusion is that “ ictus in conflict requires a pitch-accent . ” ( All these quotations are from an article on ‘ Proper Names in Old English Verse , ’ in the Publications of the Modern Language Association , n. s . vol . vii . No . 3 ) . Professor Bright 's theory of pitch-accent is a part of his general theory of opposition to what he calls the “ sense-doctrine ” of the reading of verse ,— that is , the accepted doctrine that the word and sentence accents must ordinarily take precedence of the metrical accent .</p>
   <p>According to cause or significance , accents are commonly classed in three groups : Etymological or Word Accent , Syntactical or Rhetorical Accent , and Metrical Accent . Accents of the first class are due to the original stress of the syllable in English speech ; those of the second class are due to the importance of the syllable in the sentence ; those of the third class are due to the place of the syllable in the metrical scheme . In the verse</p>
   <p>“ Mary had a little lamb , ”</p>
   <p>the first syllable may be said to be stressed primarily for etymological reasons , the seventh primarily for syntactical or rhetorical reasons , and the third ( which would not be accented in prose ) for metrical reasons .</p>
   <p>The general law of English verse is that only those syllables which bear the accent of the first class ( that is , which are stressed in common speech ) , together with monosyllables which on occasion are stressed in common speech , shall be placed so as to receive the metrical stress ; and that , if the word-stress and the metrical stress apparently conflict , the metrical stress must yield . Less generally , the rhetorical or syntactical accent in the same way takes precedence of the metrical . In both cases exceptions are of course numerous .</p>
   <p>The following are examples of verses showing a conflict between the normal prose-accent and the normal verse-accent , where — as commonly read — the prose - ( word - ) accent triumphs .</p>

   <p>These wrenched accents are characteristic of one phase of the so-called “ pre-Raphaelite ” poetry of the Victorian period ; in part , no doubt , they are due to the influence of the old ballads . My colleague Professor Newcomer has suggested that they are partly due , also , to a dislike for the combative accent which would occur where two heavy syllables came together ( accented as commonly ) in a compound like “ harp-player . ”</p>
   <p>Of special interest are the examples of wrenched and hovering accent found in the verse of Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey ,— more especially in Wyatt . These mark the time when the syllable-counting principle was coming into prominence in English verse , under the new culture of the days of Henry VIII . The first conscious followers of this principle seem to have given it such prominence that a verse seemed good to them if it contained the requisite number of syllables , whether the accents conformed to any regular system or not . In the case of Wyatt we can also compare the original forms of many of his poems , as preserved in manuscript , with the revised forms as printed in Tottel 's Miscellany ( 1557 ) . ( See Dr. Flügel 's transcriptions from the Wyatt Mss ., in Anglia , vol . xviii . ) The following is the octave of one of the sonnets , as found in the Ms .:</p>
   <p>“ Avysing the bright bemes of these fayer Iyes where he is that myn oft moisteth and wassheth the werid mynde streght from the hert departeth for to rest in his woroldly paradise And fynde the swete bitter under this gyse what webbes he hath wrought well he parceveth whereby with himselfe on love he playneth that spurreth with fyer : and bridillith with Ise . ”</p>

   <p>It appears that this revision was the work of the editor , who had a better sense of true English rhythm than the poet himself . Alscher , however , in his work on Wyatt , contends that Wyatt doubtless revised his own verses so as to give them their finished form . ( See Sir Thomas Wyatt und Seine Stellung , etc ., p . 49 . ) Other lines in Wyatt 's verse where the number of syllables is counted but where the accents are faulty , are these :</p>
   <p>“ The long love that in my thought I harbour . ”</p>
   <p>“ And there campeth displaying his banner . ”</p>
   <p>“ And there him hideth and not appeareth . ”</p>
   <p>“ For good is the life , ending faithfully . ”</p>
   <p>Another large group of hovering accents is that formed by French words with such terminations as - our , - ance , - ace , - age , - ant , - ess . In such cases the original tendency of the word was to accent the final syllable ; but the general tendency of English accents being recessive , the words often passed through a transitional period when the accent was variable or “ hovering . ” The first of the four lines just quoted shows us a word of this character .</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>B .— TIME-INTERVALS</head>
    <head>The fundamental principle of the rhythm of English verse ( and indeed of any rhythm ) is that the accents appear at regular time-intervals . In practice there is of course great freedom in departing from this regularity , the equal time-intervals being at times only a standard of rhythm to which the varying successions of accented and unaccented syllables are mentally referred . Where the equal time-intervals are observed with substantial regularity , two sorts of verse are still to be clearly distinguished : that in which not only the intervals of time but the numbers of syllables between the accents are substantially equal and regular , and that in which the number of syllables varies . The latter class is that of the native Germanic metres ; the former is that of the Romance metres , and of modern English verse as influenced by them . With the development of regularity in the counting of syllables there has perhaps also taken place a development of regularity in the regular counting of the time-intervals . In other words , the modern English reader , where the number of syllables between accents is variable , makes the time-intervals as nearly equal as possible by lengthening and shortening the syllables in the manner permitted by the freedom of English speech ; in early English verse , where the number of syllables between accents varied very greatly , we cannot be sure that the time-intervals were so accurately felt or preserved in recitation .</head>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In his Preface to this poem Coleridge said : “ The metre of the Christabel is not , properly speaking , irregular , though it may seem so from its being founded on a new principle ; namely , that of counting in each line the accents , not the syllables . Though the latter may vary from seven to twelve , yet in each line the accents will be found to be only four . Nevertheless this occasional variation in number of syllables is not introduced wantonly , or for the mere ends of convenience , but in correspondence with some transition , in the nature of the imagery or passion . ” The verse is accurately described , but it has frequently been pointed out as curious that Coleridge should have spoken of it as “ founded on a new principle , ” when the principle in question was that of native English verse from the earliest times .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></p>
   <p>For other specimens of verse showing irregularity in the number of syllables between the accents , see Part Two , under Non-syllable-counting Four-stress Verse .</p>
   <p>iii . Silent Time-intervals between Syllables ( Pauses )</p>
   <p>( a ) Pauses not filling the time of syllables .</p>
   <p>Most English verses of more than eight syllables are divided not only into the time-intervals between the accents , but also into two parts ( which Schipper calls “ rhythmical series ” ) by the Cesura . The Cesura is a pause not counted out of the regular time of the rhythm , but corresponding to the pauses between “ phrases ” in music , and nearly always coinciding with syntactical or rhetorical divisions of the sentence .</p>
   <p>The medial cesura is the typical pause of this kind , dividing the verse into two parts of approximately equal length . In much early English verse , and in French verse , this medial cesura is almost universal ; in modern English verse ( and in that of some early poets , notably Chaucer ) there is great freedom in the placing of the cesura , and also in omitting it altogether . The importance of this matter in the history of English decasyllabic verse will appear in Part Two .</p>
   <p>In the early Elizabethan period the impression was still general that there should be a regular medial cesura . Spenser seems to have been the first to imitate the greater freedom of Chaucer in this regard . See the Latin dissertation on Spenser 's verse of E. Legouis ( Quomodo E. Spenserus , etc ., Paris , 1896 ) , and the summary of its results by Mr. J . B. Fletcher in Modern Language Notes for November , 1898 . “ Spenser , ” says Mr. Fletcher , “ revived for ‘ heroic verse ’ the neglected variety in unity of his self-acknowledged master , Chaucer . ” In Gascoigne 's Notes of Instruction concerning the making of verse or ryme in English ( 1575 ) , we find : “ There are also certayne pauses or restes in a verse whiche may be called Ceasures .... In mine opinion in a verse of eight sillables , the pause will stand best in the middest , in a verse of tenne it will be placed at the ende of the first foure sillables ; in a verse of twelve , in the midst .... In Rithme royall , it is at the wryters discretion , and forceth not where the pause be untill the ende of the line . ” This greater liberty allowed the rime royal is doubtless due to the influence of Chaucer on that form . For Gascoigne 's practice in printing his verse with medial cesura , even without regard to rhetorical divisions , see the specimen given below .</p>
   <p>Another interesting Elizabethan account of the cesura is found in Puttenham 's Arte of English Poesie ( 1589 ) , where the writer compares the verse-pause to a stop made by a traveler at an inn for rest and refreshment . ( Arber 's Reprint , p . 88 . )</p>

   <p>For specimens of regular medial cesura , and of variable cesura , in modern verse , see under the Decasyllabic Couplet and Blank Verse , in Part Two .</p>
   <p>The Cesura is called masculine when it follows an accented syllable . ( For examples , see previous specimen from Gascoigne . ) It is called feminine when it follows an unaccented syllable . Two varieties of the feminine cesura are also distinguished : the Lyric , when the pause occurs inside a foot ; e. g . :</p>
   <p>“ This wicked traitor , whom I thus accuse ; ”</p>
   <p>the Epic , when the pause occurs after an extra ( hypermetrical ) light syllable ; e. g . :</p>
   <p>“ To Canterbury with ful devout corage . ”</p>
   <p>“ But how of Cawdor ? the thane of Cawdor lives . ”</p>
   <p>The “ epic ” cesura is quite as characteristic of dramatic blank verse as of epic .</p>
   <p>The pause occurring at the end of a line is equally regular with the medial pause , and corresponds in the same way to a phrase-pause in music . It is an element of the same character , then , as the cesura , though not bearing the same name . It coincides less closely than the cesura with syntactical and rhetorical pauses . When there is no corresponding syntactical or rhetorical pause at the end of the line ( in other words , when the metrical pause marking the end of the verse cannot be prominently represented in reading without interfering with the expression of the sense ) , the line is said to be “ run-on . ” Such an ending is also called enjambement . The importance of this distinction between “ end-stopped ” and “ run-on ” lines will appear in the notes on the Decasyllabic Couplet and Blank Verse , in Part Two .</p>
   <p>( b ) Pauses filling the time of syllables .</p>
   <p>A second class of silent time-intervals , or pauses , is to be distinguished from the cesural pause by the fact that in this case the time of the pause is counted in the metrical scheme . Pauses of this class correspond to rests in music ; and as in the case of such rests , their occurrence is exceptional .</p>

   <p>This omission of the first light syllable is characteristic of Chaucer 's couplet and of Middle English verse generally . ( See Schipper , vol . i. p. 462 , and ten Brink 's Chaucer 's Sprache und Verskunst , p . 175 . ) In modern verse it is not usually permitted .</p>
   <p>The time doth pass , [^] yet shall not my love .</p>
   <p>( WYATT : The joy so short , alas ! )</p>
   <p>The omitted syllable following the medial pause is closely parallel to that at the beginning of the verse .</p>
   <p>Stay ! [^] The king hath thrown his warder down .</p>
   <p>( Richard II , I. iii . 118 . )</p>

   <p>These specimens of pauses in Shakspere 's verse indicate the natural varieties of dramatic form . In such cases the pause often occurs between speeches , or where some action is to be understood as filling the time ; as in the second instance , where the accolade is given in the middle of the line . ( See Abbott 's Shakespearian Grammar , pp . 413 ff . )</p>

   <p>This is an instance of a pause forming a regular part of the verse-rhythm . Thus in the first verse of each stanza the second and sixth syllables are omitted , and the result gives the characteristic effect of the rhythm . In measures where there is regular catalexis ( that is , where the last light syllable of the verse is regularly omitted ) the phenomenon is really of the same kind .</p>

   <p>In this specimen no attempt has been made to indicate the pauses , as different readers would interpret the verse variously . It will be found that this whole poem is a study in delicate changes and arrangements of time-intervals . The four stresses characteristic of the rhythm can be accounted for in such short lines as the second and tenth , properly read .</p>

   </lg>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>According to a more elaborate system Mr. Ellis recognized nine varieties of force or stress , which he named in order as follows : subweak , weak , superweak , submean , mean , supermean , substrong , strong , superstrong . In like manner he named nine degrees each of length , pitch , weight , and silence . Length and Silence are both terms of duration of time . The meaning of Weight has not been generally understood , nor is the term ordinarily recognized . Mr. Ellis described it as “ due to expression and mental conceptions of importance , resulting partly from expression in delivery , produced by quality of tone and gliding pitch , and partly from the mental effect of the constructional predominance of conceptions . ” On this whole scheme of Mr. Ellis 's , Mr. Mayor remarks interestingly : “ Whilst I admire , I with difficulty repress a shudder at the elaborate apparatus he has provided for registering the minutest variations of metrical stress . Not only does he distinguish nine different degrees of force , but there are the same number of degrees of length , pitch , silence , and weight , making altogether forty-five varieties of stress at the disposal of the metrist ... If the analysis of rhythm is so terribly complicated , let us rush into the arms of the intuitivists and trust to our ears only , for life is not long enough to admit of characterizing lines when there are forty-five expressions for each syllable to be considered . ” ( Chapters on English Metre , p . 69 . )</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The term “ wrenched ” was used originally , it would seem , as one of reprobation . Thus Puttenham , in his Arte of English Poesie ( 1589 ) , said ; “ There can not be in a maker a fowler fault , than to falsifie his accent to serve his cadence , or by untrue orthographie to wrench his words to helpe his rime . ” ( Arber ed ., p . 94 . )</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>It is interesting to compare with these irregular lines another stanza of similar form , of about the same date , from an Elegy on Edward I ., in Böddeker 's Collection , p. 140 , and Wright 's Political Songs , p. 246 .</p>
   <p>Alle þat beoþ of huerte trewe , a stounde herkneþ to my song of duel , þat deþ haþ diht vs newe ( þat makeþ me syke ant sorewe among ! ) of a knyht , þat wes so strong , of wham god haþ don ys wille ; me þuncheþ þat deþ haþ don vs wrong , þat he so sone shal ligge stille .</p>
   <p>The comparatively great regularity of the measures in this second stanza is due to the fact that it was under the syllable-counting influence of the French , being in fact a translation of a French original .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Leigh Hunt said that “ Coleridge saw the mistake which had been made with regard to this measure , and restored it to the beautiful freedom of which it was capable , by calling to mind the liberties allowed its old musical professors the minstrels , and dividing it by time instead of syllables . ” ( See the entire passage on Christabel , in the Introduction , on “ What is Poetry ? ” , to Imagination and Fancy . For a criticism of the metrical structure of Christabel , see Robert Bridges 's Milton 's Prosody ( ed . 1901 , pp . 73-75 ) . )</p>
   <p>II . THE FOOT AND THE VERSE</p>
   <p>English verse is commonly measured by feet , a determinate number of which go to form a verse or line . The foot is determined by the distance from one accented syllable to another in the regular scheme of the metre . The usual metrical feet are either dissyllabic or trisyllabic . The dissyllabic foot is commonly called an iambus ( or iamb ) if the unaccented syllable precedes the accented , and a trochee if the accented precedes the unaccented . The trisyllabic foot is commonly called an anapest if the two unaccented syllables precede the accented syllable , and a dactyl if they follow the accented syllable .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>It will be observed that the fundamental rhythm of both iambic and trochaic verse is the same , as is also that of both anapestic and dactylic verse ; the distinction belonging only to the metre as measured into regular lines . Iambic and anapestic verse ( in which the light syllables commonly open the verse ) are sometimes called “ ascending rhythm ” ; trochaic and dactylic verse ( in which the accented syllables commonly open the verse ) “ descending rhythm . ” Ascending rhythm is very greatly in predominance in English poetry .</p>
   <p>The normal verse of any poem is therefore described by indicating the name of the foot and the number of feet in the verse . The number of feet is always indicated by the number of stresses or principal accents in the normal verse . As the light or unaccented syllables may vary from the typical number , it may also be necessary to indicate that the line is longer than its name would imply , by reason of Feminine Ending ( a light syllable added at the end ) or Anacrusis ( a light syllable prefixed ) ; or that it is shorter than its name would indicate by reason of Catalexis or Truncation ( the light syllable at the end — or less frequently at the beginning — being omitted ) .</p>
   <p>In like manner , any particular verse or line is fully described by indicating : ( 1 ) the typical foot ; ( 2 ) the number of feet ; ( 3 ) the place of the cesura ; ( 4 ) the presence or absence of a final pause ( “ end-stopped ” or “ run-on ” ) ; ( 5 ) the presence of such irregularities as</p>
   <p>( a ) Anacrusis or feminine ending , ( b ) Catalexis ( or truncation ) , ( c ) Substitution of exceptional feet for the typical foot , ( d ) Pauses other than the cesural .</p>

   <p>These specimens , as is usual in anapestic verse , show considerable freedom in the treatment of the part of the foot containing the light syllables , substituted iambi being very common . Note the iambi in the Shelley stanza , line 1 , second foot , and line 5 , first foot . In the latter case , however , the first light syllable of line 5 is really supplied by the syllable added to make the feminine ending of line 4 . In like manner , in the Scott stanza , the first syllable of line 8 is really supplied by the - ing of line 7 ; and where we have both feminine ending ( in line 1 ) and a full anapest following , the effect is that of a hypermetrical syllable which must be hurried over in the reading . In the specimen from Browning we find an iambus in the opening foot in lines 2 and 6 ( also , of course , in lines 1 and 5 ) .</p>

   <p>Of this song Mr. Saintsbury says that it is “ one of the rare examples of a real dactylic metre in English , where the dactyls are not , as usual , equally to be scanned as anapests . ” ( Life of Dryden , Men of Letters Series , p . 62 . ) Here , as almost always in English , the measure is catalectic , a final dactyl being instinctively avoided , except in short two-stress lines .</p>

   <p>( SWINBURNE : The Birds , from Aristophanes . )</p>
   <p>Of this translation Mr. Swinburne says that it was undertaken from a consideration of the fact that the “ marvellous metrical invention of the anapestic heptameter was almost exactly reproducible in a language to which all variations and combinations of anapestic , iambic , or trochaic metre are as natural and pliable as all dactylic and spondaic forms of verse are unnatural and abhorrent . ” ... “ I have not attempted , ” he says further , “ the impossible and undesirable task of reproducing the rare exceptional effect of a line overcharged on purpose with a preponderance of heavy-footed spondees .... My main desire ... was to renew as far as possible for English ears the music of this resonant and triumphant metre , which goes ringing at full gallop as of horses who</p>
   <p>‘ dance as ‘ twere to the music Their own hoofs make . ’ ”</p>
   <p>( Studies in Song , p . 68 . )</p>
   <p>Seven-stress dactylic .</p>
   <p>This form of verse may be said to be wanting . Schipper quotes as possible examples some lines which ( as he remarks ) seem to be made merely for the metrical purpose :</p>
   <p>“ Out of the kingdom of Christ shall be gathered , by angels o'er Satan victorious , All that offendeth , that lieth , that faileth to honor his name ever glorious . ”</p>
   <p>( Englische Metrik , vol . ii . p . 419 . )</p>
   <p>Eight-stress iambic .</p>
   <p>This is almost unknown in English verse , because where conceivably occurring it shows an irresistible tendency to break up into two halves of four stresses each . William Webbe , in his Discourse of English Poetrie ( 1586 ) , quoted these lines as “ the longest verse in length which I have seen used in English ":</p>
   <p>“ Where virtue wants and vice abounds , there wealth is but a baited hook , To make men swallow down their bane , before on danger deep they look . ”</p>

   <p>The breathlessly continuous character of such long anapestic or dactylic lines may of course be interrupted , by way of relief , by the substitution of iambi or trochees . In the specimen from Swinburne such a resting-place is found in line 3 , where a light syllable is omitted after winds . In the specimen from Longfellow the words high-way , distant , human , of course , fill the places of complete dactyls .</p>

   <p>In both these specimens the full accent regularly recurs in only the alternate feet . Thus while the first specimen is technically eight-stress trochaic , there are in the normal reading of it only four full accents to the line . In other words the first , third , fifth , and seventh feet are regularly pyrrhics . ( See p . 55 . ) The same thing appears in the specimen from Kipling : ye , and , in ( in line 2 ) are accented only in a distinctly secondary fashion . Some have suggested , for such rhythms as these , the recognition of a foot made up of one stressed and three unstressed syllables . Lanier represents such measures ( in The Science of English Verse ) in four-eight time .</p>

     <l n="88">scheme .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Even in metre exhibiting no marked irregularities , it is of course rather exceptional than otherwise to find all the feet in a verse conforming to the type-foot of the metre . Departures from the typical metre may be conveniently classified in five groups : Deficiency in accent ; excess of accent ; inversion of accent ; light syllable added to dissyllabic foot ; light syllable omitted in trisyllabic foot .</p>
   <p>Deficiency of accent is the most common of all the variations , if we understand by “ accent ” such syllabic stress as would be ordinarily appreciable in the reading of the word in question . It would be safe to say that in English five-stress iambic verse , read with only the ordinary etymological and rhetorical accents , twenty-five per cent of the verses lack the full five stresses characteristic of the type . In many cases , too , a foot with deficiency in stress is compensated for by another foot in the same verse showing excess of stress . Feet thus deficient in stress may conveniently be called pyrrhics , the pyrrhic being understood as made up of two unstressed syllables . This term has never become fully domesticated in English prosody , and some object to its use on the ground that we have no feet wholly without stress . Its use in the sense just indicated , however , seems to be an unquestionable convenience .</p>
   <p>Excess of accent , while less common than deficiency of accent , is even more easily recognizable . The foot containing two stressed syllables , even though one of the stresses may be distinctly stronger than the other , may conveniently be called a spondee .</p>
   <p>Inversion of accent is exceedingly familiar , especially at the beginning of the verse and after the medial pause . It consists , technically speaking , in the substitution of a trochee for an iambus or an iambus for a trochee ( the latter very rarely ) .</p>
   <p>A light syllable inserted in dissyllabic measure is not unusual , though by no means so common as the variations previously enumerated . Such a syllable is frequently spoken of as “ hypermetrical ” ; or , the variation may be considered as the substitution of an anapest for an iambus , in iambic measure , or the substitution of a dactyl for a trochee , in trochaic measure .</p>
   <p>The omission of one of the two light syllables from the foot in trisyllabic verse is so common as to make it difficult to find pure anapestic or dactylic verse in English . This fact is due in part to preference for dissyllabic measures , and in part to the usual indifference , in all Germanic verse , to accuracy in the number of light syllables . The variation may frequently be regarded as involving a prolongation of the light syllable of the foot , or a pause equal to the time of the omitted syllable ; technically speaking , it consists in the substitution of an iambus for an anapest , or a trochee for a dactyl .</p>
   <p>Examples of all these variations may best be found in the specimens of verse included in the preceding pages . A few specimens of detail are added here , for the sake of greater clearness .</p>

   <p>A distinction should be made between these hypermetrical syllables which change the character of the foot from dissyllabic to trisyllabic , and syllables ( in a sense hypermetrical ) which are slurred or elided in the reading . The word radiance , for example , is regarded as trisyllabic in prose , but in the verse —</p>
   <p>“ Girt with omnipotence , with radiance crowned , ”</p>
   <p>it is made dissyllabic by instinctive compression , and in no proper sense makes an anapest of the fifth foot . Of the same character are the numerous cases where a vowel is elided before another vowel — especially the vowel of the article the .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>On the elisions of Milton 's verse , see Mr. Robert Bridges 's Milton 's Prosody ; on those of Shakspere 's verse , see Abbott 's Shakespearian Grammar . In modern verse the use of elision and slurring is ordinarily that found in common speech .</p>

   <p>Mr. Mayor considers the question as to how far substitution of other than the typical foot may be carried in a verse , without destroying the genuineness of the fundamental rhythm . His conclusions are these :</p>
   <p>( 1 ) The limit of trochaic substitution is three feet out of five , with the final foot iambic ; or two out of five , if the fifth foot is inverted .</p>
   <p>( 2 ) A spondee is allowable in any position ; the limit is four out of five , with either the fourth or fifth foot remaining iambic .</p>
   <p>( 3 ) A pyrrhic may occur in any position ; the limit is three out of five , with the other feet preferably spondees .</p>
   <p>( 4 ) The limit for trisyllabic substitution is three out of five .</p>
   <p>( Chapters on English Metre , chap . V .)</p>
   <p>Professor Corson discusses the æsthetic effect of these changes from the typical metre : “ The true metrical artist ... never indulges in variety for variety 's sake .... All metrical effects are to a great extent relative — and relativity of effect depends , of course , upon having a standard in the mind or feelings .... Now the more closely the poet adheres to his standard — to the even tenor ( modulus ) of his verse — so long as there is no logical nor æsthetic motive for departing from it , the more effective do his departures become when they are sufficiently motived . All non-significant departures weaken the significant ones .... The normal tenor of the verse is presumed to represent the normal tenor of the feeling which produces it . And departures from that normal tenor represent , or should represent , variations in the normal tenor of the feeling . Outside of the general law ... of the slurring or suppression of extra light syllables , which do not go for anything in the expression , an exceptional foot must result in emphasis , whether intended or not , either logical or emotional .... A great poet is presumed to have metrical skill ; and where ripples occur in the stream of his verse , they will generally be found to justify themselves as organic ; i. e . they are a part of the expression . ”</p>

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>The names of the several kinds of feet are of course borrowed from classical prosody , where they are used to mark feet made up not of accented and unaccented , but of long and short syllables . The different significance of the terms as applied to the verse of different languages has given rise to some confusion , and it is proposed by some to abandon the classical terms ; their use , however , seems to be too well established in English to permit of change . Some would even abandon the attempt to measure English verse by feet , contending that its rhythm is too free to admit of any such measuring process ; thus , see Mr. J. M.

   <p>III . THE STANZA</p>
   <p>The stanza , or strophe , is the largest unit of verse-measure ordinarily recognized . It is based not so much on rhythmical divisions as on periods either rhetorical or melodic ; that is , a short stanza will roughly correspond to the period of a sentence , and a long one to that of a paragraph , while in lyrical verse the original idea was to conform the stanza to the melody for which it was written . Thus Schipper observes : “ The word strophe properly signifies a turning , and originally indicated the return of the song , as sung , to the melody with which it began . ” Schipper defines a stanza as a group of verses of a certain number , so combined that all the stanzas of the same poem will be identical in the number , the length , and the metre of the corresponding verses ; in rimed verse , also , the arrangement of the rimes will be identical . ( See Grundriss , p . 268 . )</p>
   <p>The form of a stanza , then , is determined and described ( the fundamental metre being assumed ) by the number of verses , the length of verses , and the arrangement of rimes . The usual and convenient method of indicating these conditions is to represent all the verses that rime together by the same letter , while the number of feet in the verse is written like an algebraic exponent . Thus a quatrain in “ common metre ” ( four-stress and three-stress lines ) , riming alternately , is represented by the formula a ^{ 4 } b ^{ 3 } a ^{ 4 } b ^{ 3 }.</p>
   <p>The appearance of the stanza in English verse is always the sign of foreign influence . The West Germanic verse , as far back as we have specimens of it , is uniformly stichic ( that is , marked by no periods save those of the individual verse ) , not stanzaic .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>On the other hand , we find the stanza in the Old Norse verse . Sievers 's view is that originally the two sorts of verse existed side by side , the stanzaic being preferred for chorus delivery , the stichic for individual recitation ; one form at length crowding out the other .</p>
   <p>The great organizer of the stanza is , of course , the element of rime . While unrimed stanzas are familiar in classical verse , the two innovations , rime and stanza , were introduced together into English verse , under both Latin and French influences , and have almost invariably been associated . For notes on the history of the beginnings of stanza-forms in English , see therefore under Rime , in the following section .</p>

   <p>The terza rima is , strictly speaking , a scheme of continuous verse rather than a stanza , each tercet being united by the rime-scheme to the preceding . Its use in English has always been slight , and always due to conscious imitation of the Italian . No successful attempt has been made to use it for a long poem , as Dante did in the Divina Commedia . Wyatt 's specimen is the earliest in English ; he chose the form for his three satires imitating those of Alamanni .</p>

   <p>This is the familiar stanza of the early ballads . The omission of rime in the third line signalizes the fact that the stanza could be ( and was ) regarded indifferently as made up either of two long lines or four short ones . Thus the famous Chevy Chase ballad is found ( Ashmole Ms ., of about 1560 ) written in long lines :</p>
   <p>“ The yngglyshe men hade ther bowys ybent yer hartes wer good ynoughe The first off arros that the shote off seven skore spear-men the sloughe . ”</p>
   <p>( See in Flügel 's Neuenglisches Lesebuch , vol . i. p . 199 . )</p>
   <p>The same thing occurs also where there are two rimes to the stanza . Originally , the extra internal rime was no doubt the cause of the breaking up of the long couplet into two short lines . ( See examples in Part Two , in the case of the septenary . )</p>

   <p>To Davenant 's Gondibert is usually traced the use of this “ heroic ” stanza ( abab in iambic five-stress lines ) in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . In his preface the author said : “ I believed it would be more pleasant to the reader , in a work of length , to give this respite or pause , between every stanza , ... than to run him out of breath with continued couplets . Nor doth alternate rime by any lowliness of cadence make the sound less heroic , but rather adapt it to a plain and stately composing of music . ” Dryden followed Davenant in using the stanza for his Annus Mirabilis , saying in his preface : “ I have chosen to write my poem in quatrains , or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme , because I have ever judged them more noble , and of greater dignity , both for the sound and number , than any other verse in use amongst us .... I have always found the couplet verse most easy ( though not so proper for this occasion ) , for there the work is sooner at an end , every two lines concluding the labor of the poet ; but in quatrains he is to carry it further on , and not only so , but to bear along in his head the troublesome sense of four lines together . ” Dryden did not use the stanza again , however , and it is obviously unsuited to a long narrative poem . Saintsbury says : “ With regard to the nobility and dignity of this stanza , it may safely be said that Annus Mirabilis itself , the best poem ever written therein , killed it by exposing its faults .... It is chargeable with more than the disjointedness of the couplet , without the possibility of relief ; while , on the other hand , the quatrains have not , like the Spenserian stave or the ottava rima , sufficient bulk to form units in themselves . ” ( Life of Dryden , Men of Letters Series , p . 34 . )</p>
   <p>It is hard to say what Mr. Saintsbury means in speaking of the Annus Mirabilis as the best poem ever written in the heroic quatrain , when we remember that it is the quatrain of Gray 's Elegy . On the possible sources of his use of it , see Gosse 's Life of Gray , in the Men of Letters Series , p. 98 ( also his From Shakespeare to Pope , p. 140 ) . Mr. Gosse refers to the use of the quatrain by Sir John Davies in the Nosce Teipsum ( 1599 ) , with which Gray was familiar , and ( in addition to Davenant , Dryden , and Hobbes 's Homer ) to the Love Elegies of James Hammond , published 1743 . “ It is believed that the printing of Hammond 's verses incited Gray to begin his Churchyard Elegy , and to make the four-line stanza the basis of most of his harmonies .... The measure itself , from first to last , is an attempt to render in English the solemn alternation of passion and reserve , the interchange of imploring and desponding tones , that is found in the Latin elegiac ; and Gray gave his poem , when he first published it , an outward resemblance to the text of Tibullus by printing it without any stanzaic pauses . ” Mr. Gosse neglects the elegies of William Shenstone , which were also in the quatrain , and some of which had apparently been published before the Churchyard Elegy . On this matter see Beers 's Romanticism in the Eighteenth Century , p. 137 , where Shenstone is said to have borrowed the stanza from Hammond , and Gray from Shenstone . Shenstone , in his Prefatory Essay on Elegy , defended the metrical form and referred to the elegies of Hammond . “ Heroic metre , with alternate rhyme , seems well enough adapted to this species of poetry ; and , however exceptionable upon other occasions , its inconveniencies appear to lose their weight in shorter elegies , and its advantages seem to acquire an additional importance . The world has an admirable example of its beauty in a collection of elegies not long since published . ” ( Chalmers 's English Poets , vol . xiii . p . 264 . )</p>

   <p>This stanza ( abba in four-stress iambics ) is commonly known as the “ In Memoriam stanza , ” from its familiar use by Tennyson . Tennyson is indeed said to have invented it for his own use , not knowing of its earlier appearance in the works of Jonson and Rossetti . Professor Corson has an interesting passage on the poetic quality of the stanza : “ By the rhyme-scheme of the quatrain , the terminal rhyme-emphasis of the stanza is reduced , the second and third verses being most closely braced by the rhyme . The stanza is thus admirably adapted to that sweet continuity of flow , free from abrupt checks , demanded by the spiritualized sorrow which it bears along . Alternate rhyme would have wrought an entire change in the tone of the poem . To be assured of this , one should read , aloud of course , all the stanzas whose first and second , or third and fourth , verses admit of being transposed without affecting the sense . By such transposition , the rhymes are made alternate , and the concluding rhymes more emphatic . ” Compare the stanza quoted above from section xxvii . with the transposed form :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I feel it when I sorrow most ;</l>
     <l n="2">I hold it true , whate'er befall ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis better to have loved and lost</l>
     <l n="4">Than never to have loved at all . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On the passage quoted from section lxxxiv . Professor Corson also observes : “ The four stanzas of which it is composed constitute but one period , the sense being suspended till the close . The rhyme-emphasis is so distributed that any one , hearing the poem read , would hardly be sensible of any of the slightest checks in the continuous and even movement of the verse .... There is no other section of In Memoriam in which the artistic motive of the stanza is so evident . ” ( Primer of English Verse , pp . 70-77 . )</p>

   <p>The special form of refrain stanza appearing in the first of these foreign specimens ( the Alleluia hymn form ) is generally thought to have been the source of the “ tail-rime stanza ” illustrated in the other two specimens , and in the several pages which follow . The characteristic feature of this stanza is the presence of two short lines riming together and serving as “ tails ” to the first and second parts of the body of the stanza . The same name appears in all the languages : “ versus caudati ” in the mediæval Latin , “ rime couée ” in the French , and “ Schweifreim ” in modern German . It is easy to see , what the following specimens illustrate , how stanzas constructed on this fundamental principle might be varied greatly in particular forms , according to the number , length , and rime-arrangement of the longer lines .</p>

   <p>Lines 15-22 may be paraphrased thus : “ If it were made in rime couée , in rime strangere , or rime entrelacée , there are plenty of those who read English who could not have put the tail-verses together ; so that either in the tail-verse or the baston some would have been confused , and many men that heard it would not know how it went . ” The “ interlaced ” ( alternate ) rime was a familiar form . Baston seems usually to be an equivalent for “ stanza ” or “ stave . ” It seems uncertain whether by rime strangere Manning had in mind any particular form of stanza or rime-arrangement .</p>

   <p>In these stanzas a pair of long lines bind together the first and second parts of the composition , just as the short lines do in the original rime couée .</p>
   <p>Young was and is universally condemned for choosing this form of stanza for his odes . He was led to do so by his admiration for the passage in Dryden 's Ode for St. Cecilia 's Day , running :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Assumes the god ,</l>
     <l n="2">Affects to nod ,</l>
     <l n="3">And seems to shake the spheres . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Here , said Young , Dryden was expressing “ majesty ” ; hence , since he wished his odes to be majestic , he used the short , choppy measure throughout . ( See his Introductory Essay to his Odes , in Chalmers 's English Poets , vol . xiii . ) On the other hand , the stanza as used by Read has been almost universally admired .</p>

   <p>The “ rime royal ” stanza is one of Chaucer 's contributions to English verse , and about 14 , 000 lines of his poetry are in this form . Its use by King James in the King 's Quhair was formerly thought to be the source of the name ; but it seems more likely that the name , like the form , was of French origin , and is to be connected with such terms as chant royal and ballat royal , familiar in the nomenclature of courtly poetry ( see Schipper , vol . i. p. 426 ) . The stanza was used by Chaucer with marvellous skill for purposes of continuous narrative , and was a general favorite among his imitators in the fifteenth century , being used by Lydgate , Occleve , Hawes , Dunbar , then by Skelton , and by Barclay in the Ship of Fooles . It appears popular as late as the time of Sackville 's part of the Mirror for Magistrates ( 1563 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>Later than Shakspere 's Rape of Lucrece it is rarely found . ( But see Milton 's unfinished poem on The Passion , where he used a form of the rime royal with concluding alexandrine . )</p>
   <p>Strictly speaking , the “ rime royal ” is always in five-stress verse , but in the following specimen the same rime-scheme appears in the irregular six-or-seven-stress verse of one of the Mysteries .</p>

   <p>Of the ottava rima , as used by Frere and Byron , Austin Dobson says : “ It had already been used by Harrington , Drayton , Fairfax , and ( as we have seen ) in later times by Gay ; it had even been used by Frere 's contemporary , William Tennant ; but to Frere belongs the honor of giving it the special characteristics which Byron afterward popularised in Beppo and Don Juan . Structurally the ottava rima of Frere singularly resembles that of Byron , who admitted that Whistlecraft was his ‘ immediate model . ’ ... Byron , taking up the stanza with equal skill and greater genius , filled it with the vigor of his personality , and made it a measure of his own , which it has ever since been hazardous for inferior poets to attempt . ” ( Ward 's English Poets , vol . iv . p . 240 . ) Byron may indeed be said — in the words of the present specimen — to have turned what was commonly a romantic stanza “ to burlesque . ”</p>

   <p>This stanza , which Spenser invented for his own use and to which his name is always given , was apparently formed by adding an alexandrine to the ababbcbc stanza of Chaucer . In it Spenser wrote the greater part of his poetry , and its use marks the Spenserian influence wherever found , especially among the poets of the eighteenth century ,— Thomson , Shenstone , Beattie , and the like .</p>
   <p>James Russell Lowell , in his Essay on Spenser , comments as follows : “ He found the ottava rima ... not roomy enough , so first ran it over into another line , and then ran that added line over into an alexandrine , in which the melody of one stanza seems forever longing and feeling forward after that which is to follow .... Wave follows wave with equable gainings and recessions , the one sliding back in fluent music to be mingled with and carried forward by the next . In all this there is soothingness , indeed , but no slumberous monotony ; for Spenser was no mere metrist , but a great composer . By the variety of his pauses — now at the close of the first or second foot , now of the third , and again of the fourth — he gives spirit and energy to a measure whose tendency it certainly is to become languorous . ” ( Works , vol . iv . pp . 328 , 329 . )</p>

   <p>With reference to his use of this stanza Shelley remarked , in the Preface to The Revolt of Islam : “ I have adopted the stanza of Spenser ( a measure inexpressibly beautiful ) , not because I consider it a finer model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of Shakespeare and Milton , but because in the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity : you must either succeed or fail .... But I was enticed also by the brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure . ” Professor Corson ( Primer of English Verse , p. 112 ) quotes Mr. Todhunter as saying : “ Compare the impetuous rapidity and pale intensity of Shelley 's verse with the lulling harmony , the lingering cadence , the voluptuous color of Spenser 's , or with the grandiose majesty of Byron 's .... In Adonais , indeed , a poem on which he bestowed much labor , he handles the stanza in a masterly manner , and endows it with an individual music beautiful and new . ”</p>

   <p>Mr. Israel Gollancz says , in his Introduction to this poem : “ I can point to no direct source to which the poet of Pearl was indebted for his measure ; that it ultimately belongs to Romance poetry I have little doubt . These twelve-line verses seem to me to resemble the earliest form of the sonnet more than anything else I have as yet discovered .... Be this as it may , all will , I hope , recognize that there is a distinct gain in giving to the 101 stanzas of the poem the appearance of a sonnet sequence , marking clearly the break between the initial octave and the closing quatrain .... The refrain , the repetition of the catch-word of each verse , the trammels of alliteration , all seem to have offered no difficulty to our poet ; and if power over technical difficulties constitutes in any way a poet 's greatness , the author of Pearl , from this point of view alone , must take high rank among English poets . ” ( Introduction , pp . xxiv , xxv . )</p>
   <p>Other examples of intricate stanza structure are found in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight , supposed to be by the author of Pearl . See in Part Two , p. 156 .</p>

   <p>This and the two following specimens , together with some included earlier under the head of Tail-Rime , illustrate the interest in complex lyrical measures characteristic of the period of French influence in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries . In 1152 Henry of Normandy ( who ascended the throne in 1154 ) married Eleanor of Poitou , and in her train there came to England the great troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn . On the poems of this troubadour and others of the same school , see ten Brink 's English Literature , Kennedy translation , vol . i. pp . 159-164 . Other troubadours followed , and found a home in the court of Richard the Lion-Hearted , who himself entered the ranks of the poets . The result was a great mass of Norman French lyrical poetry , often in intricate forms , and a smaller mass of imitative lyrics in Middle English . As Schipper observes , the elaborate lyrical forms were inconsistent with English taste , and it was only the simpler ones which were widely adopted . On the general character of the Romance stanza-forms , and their influence in England , see Schipper , vol . i. pp . 309 ff .</p>

   <p>This verse of the early Mystery Plays and connected forms of the drama shows an extraordinary variety of measures . In general , the effort of the writers seems to have been to show some artistic ingenuity of structure , and at the same time keep to the free popular dialogue verse which was associated with the plays . We find , therefore , tumbling verse , alexandrines , septenaries , and intricate strophic forms , all commonly written with slight regard for syllable-counting principles .</p>

   <p>IV . TONE-QUALITY</p>
   <p>The quality of the sounds of the words used in verse , although in no way concerned in the rhythm , is an element of some importance . The sound-quality may be used in either of two ways : as a regular coördinating element in the structure of the verse , or as a sporadic element in the beauty or melody of the verse .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>A . AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT</head>
    <head>In this capacity , similar qualities of sound indicate coördinated parts of the verse-structure , thus emphasizing the idea of similarity ( corresponding to that of symmetry in arts expressed in space ) which is at the very basis of rhythmical composition .</head>
    <head>Obviously , the similarity may exist between vowel sounds , consonant sounds , or both ; more specifically , it is found either in initial consonants , in accented vowels , or in accented vowels plus final consonants . Properly speaking , the term Rime is applicable to all three cases ; the first being distinguished as initial rime or Alliteration ( German Anreim or Stabreim ) ; the second as Assonance ( Stimmreim ) , the third as complete Rime ( Vollreim ) . English usage commonly reserves the term Rime for the third class .</head>
     <l n="1">i. Assonance</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Assonance was the characteristic coördinating element in the verse of the early Romance languages , the Provençal , Old French , and Spanish . Thus in the Chanson de Roland ( eleventh century ) we find the verses of each laisse , or strophe , bound together by assonance . Frequently this develops into full rime by chance or convenience . The following is a characteristic group of verses from the Roland :</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This specimen represents the use of alliteration in the most regularly constructed Anglo-Saxon verse . The two half-lines are united into the long line by the same initial consonant in the important syllables . In the first half-line the alliteration is on the two principally stressed syllables , or on one of them alone ( most frequently the first ) ; in the second half-line it is commonly found only on the first . Alliterating unstressed syllables are usually regarded as merely accidental . Any initial vowel sound alliterates with any other vowel sound .</p>
   <p>The most regular verse appears in Anglo-Saxon poetry of what may be called the classical period ,— 700 A. D. and for a century following ,— represented by Beowulf and the poems of Cynewulf . By the time of Ælfric , who wrote about 1000 A. D ., there appear signs of a breaking in the regular verse-form . ( See Schipper , vol . i. pp . 60 ff . ) For example , two alliterative syllables often appear in the second half-line ; one half-line may be without alliteration ; alliteration may bind different long-lines together ; or alliteration may be altogether wanting . There are also additions of many light syllables , resulting almost , as Schipper observes , in rhythmical prose . These tendencies resulted in the wholly irregular use of alliteration appearing in much of the verse of the early Middle English period , illustrated in the specimens that follow .</p>
   <p>The origins of alliteration in Germanic verse are lost in the general mass of Germanic origins . It is almost universally regarded as a purely native development , although M. Kawczynski ( Essai Comparatif sur l'Origine et l'Histoire des Rythmes ; Paris , 1889 ) sets forth the remarkable opinion that the Germans derived their alliteration from the Romans . “ We must remember , ” he says , “ the schools of rhetoric existing in Gaul in the sixth and seventh centuries , where alliteration seems to have been held in esteem .... It became more and more frequent in the Latin poetry of the Carlovingian period , and it will suffice to cite here the following verses from Milo of Saint Amand :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Pastores pecum primi pressique pavore</l>
     <l n="2">Conspicuos cives carmen caeleste canentes</l>
     <l n="3">Audivere astris arrectis auribus ; auctor</l>
     <l n="4">Ad terras ... ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It early passed to Ireland , and the Irish made use of it in their Latin poetry and in their national poetry . The example of the Irish was followed by the Anglo-Saxons , although these last had derived the same rules from the Latin writers .... The Anglo-Saxons , who sent the second series of apostles to the Germans , taught them the use of alliteration in poetry . The Scandinavians , on their side , learned it also from the Anglo-Saxons . ” This theory has found no adherents among scholars , and M. Kawczynski 's illustrations are probably most useful in emphasizing the natural pleasure in similarity of sound found among all peoples . See below , on the related question of the origin of end-rime .</p>

     <l n="9">iii . Rime ( i. e . end-rime )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Full rime , or end-rime , involves the principally stressed vowel in the riming word , and all that follows that vowel . When there is an entire unstressed syllable following , the rime is called double , or feminine . Triple rime is also recognized , though rare .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>End-rime being a stranger to the early Germanic languages , its appearance in any of them may commonly be taken as a sign of foreign influence . In general , of course , rime and the stanza were introduced together into English verse , under the influence of Latin hymns and French lyrics .</p>
   <p>The functions of rime in English verse may perhaps be grouped under three heads : the function of emphasis , the function of forming beautiful or pleasurable sounds , and the function of combining or organizing the verses . It is with reference to the first of these that Professor Corson speaks of rime as “ an enforcing agency of the individual verse . ” Under the second head rime is considered simply as a form of tone-color , and as furnishing a part of the melody of verse . The third function , by which individual verses are bound into stanzas , is , in a sense , the most important .</p>
   <p>On the subject of the æsthetic values of rime , see the chapter on “ poetic unities ” in Corson 's Primer of English Verse , and Ehrenfeld 's Studien zur Theorie des Reims ( Zürich , 1897 ) . The problem of the relative values of rimed and unrimed verse will come up in connection with the history of the heroic couplet and of blank verse . The objection always urged against rime is that its demands are likely to turn the poet aside from the normal order of his ideas . Herder , as Ehrenfeld points out , thought that this was particularly true of English verse , the uninflected language not providing so naturally for cases where thought and sound are parallel . A recent protest against the tyranny of rime is found in the article by Mr. Larminie , cited on page 115 , where it is claimed that undue attention to form is thinning out the substance of modern poetry , and that the demands of rime should be relaxed . See also Ben Jonson 's “ Fit of Rhyme against Rhyme , ” for a humorous complaint against the requirements of rime upon the poet .</p>
   <p>The origin of rime has been a subject of prolonged controversy . See the monograph by Ehrenfeld already cited ; Meyer 's Anfang und Ursprung der rythmischen Dichtung ( Munich , 1884 ) ; W. Grimm 's Geschichte des Reims ( 1851 ) ; Norden 's Antike Kunstprosa ( Leipzig , 1898 ; Anhang ueber die Geschichte des Reims ) ; Kluge 's article , Zur Geschichte des Reimes im Altgermanischen , in Paul u. Braune 's Beiträge , vol . ix . p. 422 ; and Schipper , vol . i. pp . 34 ff . Meyer 's work is an exposition of the theory that rime was an importation from the Orient . In like manner , it has been held by many that the poetry of Otfried ( the first regularly rimed German verse ) was produced under Latin influence wholly , and that rime was introduced by him to the Germans ( see the work by Kawczynski , cited p. 117 ) . Herder ( see Ehrenfeld 's monograph ) regarded rime as a natural growth of the instinct for symmetry in all human taste , closely connected with dance-rhythms , all forms of parallelism , and the like . Similarity of inflectional endings in similar clauses , he pointed out , would naturally develop rime in any inflected language . This view is in line with the tendency of recent opinion . Schipper says , in effect : “ Is rime to be regarded as the invention of a special people , like the Arabian , or is it a form of art which developed in the poetic language of the Aryan peoples , separately in the several nations ? In the opinion of the principal scholars the latter opinion is the correct one . The chief support of this opinion is the fact that traces of rime , in greater or less number , appear in the oldest poetry of almost all the partially civilized peoples . ‘ It is , ’ says C. F. Meyer , ‘ something inborn , original , universally human , like poetry and music , and no more than these the special invention of a single people or a particular time . ’ In fact , traces of rime may be noticed in the poetry of the Greeks , in Homer , Æschylus , Sophocles , Aristophanes , as also in the poetry of the Romans ; in a more developed form it appears in the late middle Latin clerical poetry . In the Celtic languages , moreover , rime is the indispensable mark of the poetic form , even in the oldest extant specimens . The Latin poetry just referred to gives interesting evidence that rime is a characteristic sign of popular poetry . While the quantitative system became dominant , with the artistic verse-forms of the Greeks , in the Golden Age of Roman literature , the early Saturnian verses , written in free rhythms , already showed the popular taste for similarity of sound in the form of alliteration ; and in the post-classical time , with the fall of the quantitative metres , rime again came to the front in songs intended for the people . The same element was made so essential a characteristic in the organization of verse in the mediæval Latin , that ‘ carmen rhythmicum ’ came to signify a rimed poem , and the later Latinists used the word ‘ rhythmus ’ precisely in the sense of ‘ rime . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Schipper goes on to inquire whether this mediæval Latin poetry was the means of introducing rime to the Germanic peoples . Wackernagel held it as certain that Otfried learned his rimes from Latin poems ; but as Otfried declares that his poetry is intended to take the place of useless popular songs , it seems probable that he was not using an innovation , and that rime was already popular in Old High German . Indeed , it appears sporadically in the Hildebrandslied and the Heliand . Grimm observes that it is theoretically unlikely that alliteration should have vanished suddenly and rime as suddenly have taken its place . The gradual development of rime from assonance among the Romance peoples suggests the same thing . The early appearance of rime by the side of alliteration is illustrated by C. F. Meyer ( Historische Studien , Leipzig , 1851 ) from the Norse Edda , from Beowulf , Cædmon , etc . In the later Anglo-Saxon period rime was evidently securing a considerable though uncertain hold . The Riming Poem suggests what development rime might have had in English without the incoming of Romance influences . Grimm observes that , while to his mind alliteration was a finer and nobler quality than rime , there was need of a stronger sound-likeness which should hold the attention more firmly by its unchanging place at the end of the line . Schipper remarks , finally , that the fact that the use of rime in connection with alliteration was especially popular in the southern half of England , where the Romance influence was strongest , may suggest why in the more purely Germanic northern half alliteration remained the single support of the poetic form well into the fifteenth century .</p>
   <p>The appendix to the work of Norden , cited above , is a fuller development of ideas frequently suggested by the sporadic appearance of rime in early Greek and Latin literature . Norden gives many examples of this “ rhetorical rime , ” as well as of rime arising naturally from parallelism of sentence structure found in primitive charms , incantations , and the like . In particular he emphasizes the influence of the figure of hom [ oe ] oteleuton as used in the literary prose of the classical languages . His conclusion is as follows : “ Rime , then , was potentially as truly present in the Greek and Latin languages , from the earliest times , as in every other language ; but in the metrical ( quantitative ) poetry it had no regular place , and appeared there in general only sporadically and by chance , being used by only a few poets as a rhetorical ornament . It became actual by the transition from the metrical poetry to the rhythmical ( that is , the syllable-counting , in which — in the Latin — the chief consideration is still for the word-accent ) ; and this transition was consummated by the aid of the highly poetic prose , already used for centuries , which was constructed according to the laws of rhythm , and in which the rhetorical hom [ oe ] oteleuton had gained an ever-increasing significance . In particular , rime found an entrance through sermons composed in such prose , and delivered in a voice closely approaching that of singing , into the hymn-poetry which was intimately related to such sermons . From the Latin hymn-poetry it was carried into other languages , from the ninth century onward . It is self-evident that in these languages also rime was potentially present before it became actual through the influence of foreign poetry ; for in this region also there operates the highest immanent law of every being and every form of development ,— that in the whole field of life nothing absolutely new is invented , but merely slumbering germs are awakened to active life . ” ( Antike Kunstprosa , vol . ii . pp . 867 ff . )</p>

   <p>This puzzlingly early appearance of rime in Anglo-Saxon verse , in conjunction with fairly regular alliteration , is of especial interest .<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>“ It is supposed , ” says Schipper , “ that this new form has for its foundation the Scandinavian Runhenda , and that this was known to the Anglo-Saxons through the Old Norse poet , Egil Skalagrimsson , who was living in England in the tenth century , and who stayed twice in England at Athelstan 's court , writing a poem in Northumbria in the same form . ” He also observes that the attempt to attain something like equality of feet and half-lines suggests the Norse models .</p>

   <p>These passages illustrate sufficiently the grotesque effects of double and triple rime in English verse ,— effects of which Byron and Browning are the unquestioned masters . Professor Corson observes that the double rime is to be regarded as the means of “ some special emphasis , ” whether serious or humorous . More commonly the effect is humorous , of course , as in Don Juan , where the rimes indicate “ the lowering of the poetic key — the reduction of true poetic seriousness . ” The rimes in the Flight of the Duchess Mr. Edmund Gurney has said sometimes “ produce the effect of jokes made during the performance of a symphony . ” The specimen which follows illustrates the use of these double and triple rimes for a wholly serious purpose . Professor Corson remarks that in this case the rime serves “ as a most effective foil to the melancholy theme . It is not unlike the laughter of frenzied grief . ” It is interesting to note that in the Italian language , where double rimes are almost constant , masculine rimes are sometimes used for grotesque effect in the same way that English poets use the feminine .</p>

   <p>Internal rime .</p>
   <p>Internal rime may be regarded on the one side as only a matter of the division of the verse , since if it occurs regularly at the medial cesura , it practically breaks the verse into two parts . On the other side , if used only sporadically , it is a matter of tone-color . It sometimes appears , however , in forms which entitle it to recognition by itself . The earliest of these forms is the “ Leonine rime , ” which is said to have taken its name from Leoninus of St. Victor , who in the twelfth century wrote elegiacs ( hexameters and pentameters ) in which the syllable preceding the cesura regularly rimed with the final syllable . Obviously lines of this kind would easily break up into riming half-lines . Similarly , in septenary verse internal rime was often used together with end-rime , with a resulting resolution into short-line stanzas riming either aabb or abab .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>The following specimen from a celebrated ballad shows the popular use of a somewhat complex system of internal rime .</p>

   <p>B . AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT ( TONE-COLOR )</p>
   <p>This division includes the use made of the qualities of sound for the purpose of adding to the melodiousness of verse , or of expressing in some measure the ideas to be conveyed by means of the very sounds employed . Sometimes this takes the form of alliteration , differing from that of early English verse only in that it follows no regular structural laws . On the other hand , it may take the form of onomatop [ oe ] ia , the figure of speech in which sound and sense are closely related ,— as in descriptive words like buzz , hiss , murmur , splash , and the like . The term Tone-color is formed by analogy with the German Klangfarbe , an expression apparently due to the feeling that the sound-qualities of speech have somewhat the same function as the various colors in a picture . It is unquestionably true that the selection of sounds , whether vowel or consonantal , has much to do with the melodious effect of very much poetry . The poet may choose the different sound-qualities ( so far as the sense permits ) just as the musician may choose the varying qualities of the different instruments in the orchestra or the different stops in the organ .</p>
   <p>Strictly speaking , this matter of Tone-color is not a part of verse-form in the same sense as matters of rhythm , rime , and the like ; for it may appear in prose as well as in verse , and is not in any case reducible to formal principles or laws . Yet its use in actual verse is so important , and it is so closely related to the use of sound-quality in the form of rime and alliteration , that it seems well to include it here .<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span></p>
   <p>Dr . Guest treats sounds as having in themselves the suggestion of more or less definite ideas , this suggestiveness being explainable by physical causes . Thus the trembling character of l suggests trepidation , as in “ Double , double , toil and trouble . ” R suggests harsh , grating , or rattling noises ; the sibilants are appropriate to the expression of shrieks , screams , and the like ; b and p , because of the compression of the lips , suggest muscular effort ; st , from a sudden stopping of the s , suggests fear or surprise ; f and h also fear , because of their whispering quality . Hollow sounds ( au , ow , o , and the like ) suggest depth and fulness . Guest quotes in this connection an interesting passage from Bacon 's Natural History ( ii . 200 ): “ There is found a similitude between the sound that is made by inanimate bodies , or by animate bodies that have no voice articulate , and divers letters of articulate voices ; and commonly men have given such names to those sounds as do allude unto the articulate letters ; as trembling of hot water hath resemblance unto the letter l ; quenching of hot metals with the letter z ; snarling of dogs with the letter r ; the noise of screech-owls with the letter sh ; voice of cats with the diphthong eu ; voice of cuckoos with the diphthong ou ; sounds of strings with the diphthong ng .</p>
   <p>A. W. Schlegel went even farther in suggesting a subtle symbolism in sounds apart from descriptive qualities . Thus he regarded a as suggestive of bright red , and as symbolizing youth , joy , or brightness ( as in the words Strahl , Klang , Glans ) ; i as suggestive of sky-blue , symbolic of intimacy or love ; and so with other vowel sounds . ( See Ehrenfeld 's monograph , p . 57 . ) In general it may be said that it is dangerous to attempt to explain the special effects of tone-color in verse , except where it is obviously descriptive , the appreciation of such effects being a subtle and a more or less individual matter . On this subject Mr. Gurney makes some interesting observations , in the essays cited above . He believes that the pleasurable effect of the sound-qualities in verse can never be dissociated from the sense of the words ; that the most melodious verse cannot be appreciated if in a foreign language , unless read with particular expressiveness ; and that the pleasure derived from what we roughly call melodious or harmonious verses is always due to the mystical combination of the appropriate sound with the poetic content .</p>
   <p>Dr. Johnson ridiculed the idea of tone-color , as appearing in Pope 's teaching that the sound should be “ an echo to the sense . ” See his Life of Pope , and especially the Idler for June 9 , 1759 , in which he describes Minim the critic as reading “ all our poets with particular attention to this delicacy of versification . ” Such a critic discovers wonders in these lines from Hudibras :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Honor is like the glossy bubble ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which cost philosophers such trouble ;</l>
     <l n="3">Where , one part crack 'd , the whole does fly ,</l>
     <l n="4">And wits are crack 'd to find out why . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ In these verses , says Minim , we have two striking accommodations of the sound to the sense . It is impossible to utter the first two lines emphatically without an act like that which they describe ; bubble and trouble causing a momentary inflation of the cheeks by the retention of the breath , which is afterwards forcibly emitted , as in the practice of blowing bubbles . But the greatest excellence is in the third line , which is crack 'd in the middle to express a crack , and then shivers into monosyllables . ”</p>
   <p>In an article on “ Some Technical Elements of Style in Literature ” ( originally published in the Contemporary Review , April , 1885 ; reprinted in the Scribner edition of Stevenson 's Works , vol . xxii . p. 243 ) Robert Louis Stevenson discussed some of the more subtle effects of vowel and consonant color , as appearing in both prose and verse . The combination and repetition of the consonants PVF he found to be particularly frequent . The pervading sound-elements in the two following passages he analyzed by means of the key-letters in the margin :</p>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>“ Perfect rime ” is a term applied to rimes between two words identical in form , but different in meaning . It is inadmissible in modern English verse , although it was considered entirely proper in Middle English times ( compare Chaucer 's —</head>

   <p>Schipper gives a separate paragraph also to “ unaccented rime , ” where the similarity of sound belongs wholly to final , unstressed syllables . Generally speaking , this is inadmissible in English verse . Schipper quotes from Thomas Moore :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Down in yon summervale Where the rill flows , Thus said the Nightingale</l>
     <l n="2">To his loved Rose . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It might be said , however , that the final syllables of “ summervale ” and “ nightingale ” are not wholly unstressed ; moreover , they are in the first and third verses of the stanza , where rime is not indispensable . Unaccented rime is most noticeable in some of the verse of the transition period in the sixteenth century , when the syllable-counting principle was so emphasized as to admit any license of accent so long as the proper number of syllables was observed . Thus , in the verse of Wyatt we find such rimes as “ dreadeth ” and “ seeketh , ” “ beginning ” and “ eclipsing , ” etc . See p. 10 , above .</p>
   <p>Imperfect rime , occurring where the vowel sounds are only similar , not identical , or where the consonants following them are not identical , is commonly regarded as an imperfection in verse form . The most common of these imperfect rimes are in cases where the spelling would indicate perfect rime ( hence where , in many cases , the words rimed originally , but have separated in the changes of pronunciation ) , such as love and move , broad and load , and the like . For a defence of these “ rimes to the eye , ” and other imperfect rimes , with a study of their use by English poets , see articles by Prof. A. G. Newcomer in the Nation for January 26 and February 2 , 1899 .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>Rime also appears in a short passage in Cynewulf 's Elene . Some have thought it a later interpolation , but Schipper thinks it indicates that Cynewulf was a Northumbrian .

   <p>PART TWO</p>
   <p>I. FOUR-STRESS VERSE</p>
   <p>English verse of four stresses is chiefly to be divided into two groups : that representing the primitive Germanic tendency to emphasize the element of accent rather than the counting of syllables , and that produced under foreign influence , showing comparative regularity in the number of syllables to the verse . The first group is made up of the various descendants of the original “ long line , ” sometimes rimed and sometimes unrimed ; the second group of forms of the familiar octosyllabic couplet . ( Of modern verse only iambic measures are included here . )</p>
   <p>A .— NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING</p>
   <p>The earliest English verse , like early Germanic verse generally , is based on the recurrence of strong accents , and is composed of a long line made up of two short lines , or half-lines , which are bound together by alliteration . As to the number of accents to be counted in the line , there are two theories , the “ two-accent ” and the “ four-accent . ” According to the first , we should count two accents to the half-line , and four to the long line ; according to the second , we should count four to the half-line and eight to the long line . The distinction is not so marked , however , as would appear at first thought ; for the two-accent theorists recognize a considerable number of secondary accents in addition to the principal ones , while the four-accent theorists recognize half the accents as being commonly weaker than the other half .</p>
   <p>The four-accent theory is that of Lachmann , represented chiefly in more recent scholarship by ten Brink and Kaluza . Lachmann took , as the typical Germanic line , such a verse as this from the Hildebrandlied ,—</p>
   <p>“ Garutun se iro guðhama : gurtun sih iro suert ana ; ”</p>
   <p>but admitted that the Anglo-Saxon line was a departure from the type in the direction of fewer accents . Ten Brink , however , found the full number of accents in the typical Anglo-Saxon line . “ It is based upon a measure which belonged to the antiquity of all Germanic races , namely , the line with eight emphatic syllables , divided into equal parts by the cesura . ” ( English Literature , trans . Kennedy , vol . i. pp . 21 , 22 . ) The principal representative of the two-accent theory is Sievers , whose conclusions have been pretty generally accepted by English and American scholars . He admits that very many , perhaps most , Anglo-Saxon lines can be read with eight accents , but shows that there is still a large proportion ( some eleven hundred in Beowulf ) which cannot be so read without wrenching the natural reading . On this subject , see Westphal 's Allgemeine Metrik , Sievers 's Altgermanische Metrik , Kaluza 's Der Altenglische Vers , and the articles by Sievers , Luick , and ten Brink in Paul 's Grundriss der Germanische Philologie .</p>
   <p>Aside from the two-part structure of the long line , the number of accents , and the alliteration , Anglo-Saxon verse is marked by the usual coincidence of the principal accents with long syllables . The unaccented parts of the line vary in both the number and length of the syllables . In general , each half-line is divided into two feet , or measures ; and , according to the structure of these feet , the ordinary half-lines of Anglo-Saxon verse have been reduced by Sievers to five fundamental types .</p>
   <p>Type A is represented by such a half-line as “ stiðum wordum . ”</p>
   <p>Type B inverts the rhythm of A , as in the half-line “ n [= e ] wintersc [= u ] r . ”</p>
   <p>Type C is characterized by the juxtaposition of the two accents , as in the half-line “ and forð gangan . ”</p>
   <p>Type D commonly has only the accented syllable in the first foot , while the second foot is characterized by a sort of dactylic rhythm , as in the half-lines “ s [= æ ] l [= i ] ðende ” and “ flet innanweard . ”</p>
   <p>Type E inverts the rhythm of D , as in the half-line “ gylp-wordum spræc . "[ 16 ]</p>
   <p>In all the types many variations are found . The beginning of the line may show anacrusis , and two short syllables may take the place of a long syllable ; while an indeterminate number of light syllables may often be introduced before or after the principal accents .</p>
   <p>Hafað [= u ] s [= a ] l [= y ] fed lucis auctor , þæt w [= e ] m [= o ] tun h [= e ] r merueri g [= o ] dd [= æ ] dum begietan gaudia in celo , þ [= æ ] r w [= e ] m [= o ] tun maxima regna s [= e ] can and gesittan sedibus altis , lifgan in lisse lucis et pacis , [= a ] gan eardinga almæ letitæ , br [= u ] can bl [= æ ] ddaga blandem et mitem ges [= e ] on sigora Fr [= e ] an sine fine , and him lof singan laude perenne [= e ] adge mid englum Alleluia .</p>
   <p>( From the Anglo-Saxon Ph [ oe ] nix . ab . 700 A. D .)</p>
   <p>These closing lines of the poem furnish an important opportunity to compare the Latin half-lines with those in Anglo-Saxon . Each half seems to be influenced by the metrical nature of the other ; the Anglo-Saxon being a little more regular in the number of syllables than usual , the Latin less regular . Since , to the ear of the writer , the two halves of each verse were doubtless fairly equivalent , metrically , and since each of the Latin half-lines appears to have two accents , these combination verses have been thought to be an argument for the “ two-accent ” theory of Anglo-Saxon verse . On the other hand , the advocates of the four-accent theory would read the Latin half-lines with four stresses each , on the ground that nearly every syllable was stressed in the chanting of such religious verse ( lú-cís aúc-tór , etc . ) .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The metre of King Horn is very irregular , and has proved somewhat puzzling to scholars . It seems to be the direct result of the primitive “ long line ” broken into two halves by internal rime . The number of accents varies greatly : we may have verses which are easily read with two , such as —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Into schupes borde</l>
     <l n="2">At the furst worde . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Yet these it is evident might also be read with three accents , as in the</l>
     <l n="4">following couplet also :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ The se bigan to flowe ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Horn child to rowe . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>According as one reads the Anglo-Saxon verse with two or four accents to the half-line , he will regard the typical half-line of King Horn as made up of two or four accents . If the fundamental number was two , the additional accented syllables were doubtless introduced under the influence of the French eight-syllable couplet . It is not difficult to see how the more regular ( Latin or French ) and the less regular ( native ) measures might have been confused , and soon have coalesced in popular use . Ten Brink , reading the King Horn lines with four accents , speaks of them as “ formed entirely on the Teutonic principle , with two accents upon the sonorous close of the verse , so that it appears to be an organic continuation of the chief form in Layamon and in Ælfred 's Proverbs . This circumstance makes the poem exceptional among the early English romances . ” He also speaks of “ an unmistakably strophic construction in the text as we have it . ” ( English Literature , Kennedy translation , vol . i. p . 227 . )</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>These two specimens , both doubtless the work of the same author ( to whom are also attributed the Pearl and Cleanness ) , represent the patriotic revival of the alliterative long line by contemporaries of Chaucer in the latter half of the fourteenth century . In Sir Gawayne the rimeless long line is gathered into strophes , each of which concludes with four riming lines . ( See above , p . 109 . )</p>
   <p>For analysis of this revived alliterative verse , see a valuable article by Dr. Luick , Die Englische Stabreimzeile im 14n , 15n , und 16n Jahrhundert , in Anglia , vol . xi . pp . 392 and 553 . Luick analyzes not only the poems of the “ Pearl poet , ” but also the Troy Book , the Alexander Fragments , William of Palerne , Joseph of Arimathea , Morte Arthure , and minor poems . He finds the Troy Book the most regular alliterative poem of Middle English , but in all of the group a general tendency to preserve not only the early laws of alliteration but also the “ five types ” of Sievers 's Anglo-Saxon metrics . Dr. Luick attributes the final decline of the old measure in large degree to the falling away of the final syllables in - e , etc . ; without these numerous feminine endings the primitive “ long line ” was impossible . This he regards as regrettable , since the old alliterative verse , “ growing up on native soil with the language itself , ” represented the natural accent-relations of the Germanic languages , especially the recognition of two principal degrees of accent ; whereas the modern rimed verse requires the reduction of this to a uniform “ tick-tack ” of alternating stress and non-stress .</p>

   <p>Spenser 's use of the tumbling verse in the Shepherd 's Calendar was a part of his imitation of older forms for the sake of an uncultivated , bucolic effect . In his hands the irregular measure showed a tendency to reduce itself to regular ten-syllable lines , like the first two of the present specimen , which , by themselves , might easily be read as decasyllabic iambics . On this , see further under Five-Stress Verse . Spenser was perhaps the last cultivated poet to use the irregular measure , until we come to modern imitators of the early popular poetry .

   <p>B .— SYLLABLE-COUNTING ( OCTOSYLLABIC COUPLET )</p>
   <p>The more regular four-stress verse , in rimed couplets showing a tendency to be octosyllabic , we have seen to be generally attributed to the influence of the French octosyllabics , which were in common use in late mediæval French poetry , such as that of Wace and Chrestien de Troyes .</p>
   <p>According to Stengel ( in Gröber 's Grundriss der Romanischen Philologie ) , this octosyllabic French verse goes back to a lost vulgar Latin verse ; this view is opposed by Dr. C. M. Lewis , in his Foreign Sources of Modern English Versification ( Yale Studies in English , 1898 ) , who finds its origin in the tetrameter of the Latin hymns . Dr. Lewis also attributes to this Latin verse more direct influence on English verse than is commonly assumed . Thus he finds in it , rather than in the French octosyllabics , the model of the verse of the Pater Noster , quoted below . The argument is briefly this : the Latin verse was both accentual and syllabic ; the French verse was syllabic but not accentual ; that of the Pater Noster is accentual but not syllabic ; hence it is more nearly like the Latin than the French . A stanza of the Latin tetrameter , cited by Dr. Lewis from the hymn Aurora lucis rutilat , is as follows :</p>
   <p>“ Tristes erat apostoli de nece sui Domini , quem p [ oe ] na mortis crudeli servi damnarunt impii . ”</p>
   <p>Compare these lines from the Brut of Wace :</p>
   <p>“ Adunt apela Cordeille qui esteit sa plus joes ne fille ; pur ce que il l'aveit plus chiere que Ragaü ne la premiere quida que el e cuneüst que plus chier des al tres l'eüst . Cordeil le out bien escuté et bien out en sun cuer noté cument ses deus sorurs parloënt , cument lur pere losengoënt . ”</p>
   <p>The last four verses of this passage are cited by Schipper as illustrating the regular iambic character of the French octosyllabics ; but Dr. Lewis regards the measure as purely syllabic , with no regard for alternation of accents , and instances the earlier lines of the passage as being quite as nearly anapestic as iambic . ( See Schipper , vol . i. p. 107 , and Lewis 's monograph , as cited above , pp . 73 ff . See also Crow : Zur Geschichte des Kurzen Reimpaares in Mittel Englisch . ) Dr. Lewis 's conclusion is : “ We may therefore sum up the whole history of our octosyllabic verse in this way : we borrowed its number of accents from the Latin , but owing to the vitality of our own native traditions we at first borrowed nothing further ; the syllabic character of the verse ( so far as it has been imported at all ) , came in only gradually , against stubborn resistance ; and it came not directly from the Latin , but indirectly , through the French ” ( pp . 97 , 98 ) . Some of these statements are open to question ; but however we may interpret the French verse of Wace and his contemporaries , it is obvious that in English the influence of the Latin and the French poetry would very naturally be fused , with no necessarily clear conception of definite verse-structure . Whether under French or Latin influence , however , the new tendency was for the more accurate counting of syllables . We may see some suggestion of this in the verses of St. Godric , quoted on p. 126 , above , although they are not regularly iambic . The poem on the “ Eleven Pains of Hell ” ( in the Old English Miscellany ) shows the French influence clearly marked by the language of its opening verses :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Ici comencent les unze peynes</l>
     <l n="2">De enfern , les queus seynt pool v [ ist ] . ”</l>

   <p>( The Pater Noster , ab . 1175 . In Morris 's Old English Homilies , p . 55 . )</p>
   <p>This poem is sometimes said to show the first appearance of the octosyllabic couplet in English . It suggests the struggle between native indifference to syllable-counting and imitation of the greater regularity of its models . As Dr. Morris says of the next specimen : “ The essence of the system of versification which the poet has adopted is , briefly , that every line shall have four accented syllables in it , the unaccented syllables being left in some measure , as it were , to take care of themselves . ” But this does not altogether do justice to the new regularity . Schipper says that of the first 100 lines of the poem 20 are perfectly regular . ( See his notes in vol . i. p . 109 . ) In the following specimens we may trace the gradual growth of skill and accuracy .</p>

   <p>For lays and romances , both French and English , the four-stress couplet was an easy and favorite form . Compare the remarks of ten Brink : “ We see how the short couplet , which is the standing form of the court-romance , was not only transmitted to it from the legendary , didactic , and historical poems , but was also suggested to it by those songs to which it was indebted for its own subject-matter . Other tokens indicate that a short strophe composed of eight-syllabled lines , with single or alternating rhymes , was a favorite form for many subjects in this jongleur poetry .... The simple form of the short couplet offered to the romance-poet no scope to compete in metrical technique with the skilled court-lyrists . He could prove his art only within a limited portion of this field : in the treatment of the enjambement and particularly of rhyme . The poet strove not only to form pure rhymes , but often to carry them forward with more syllables than were essential , and he was fond of all sorts of grammatical devices in rhyme . ” ( English Literature , Kennedy trans ., vol . i. pp . 174 , 175 . )</p>

   <p>It was Gower and Chaucer , in the fourteenth century , who brought the use of the eight-syllable couplet to the point of accuracy and perfection . Gower made it the vehicle of the interminable narrative of the Confessio Amantis , using it with regularity but with great monotony . Chaucer transformed it into a much more flexible form ( with freedom of cesura , enjambement , and inversions ) , using it in about 3500 lines of his poetry ( excluding the translation of the Roman de la Rose ) , but early leaving it for the decasyllabic verse . In modern English poetry this short couplet has rarely been used for continuous narrative of a serious character , except by Byron and Wordsworth .</p>

   <p>II . FIVE-STRESS VERSE</p>
   <p>The five-stress or decasyllabic verse ( iambic pentameter ) is so much more widely used in modern English poetry than any other verse-form , that its history is of special interest . It is curious that a form so completely adopted as the favorite of English verse should be borrowed rather than native ; but , the syllable-counting principle once being admitted , there is nothing in five-stress verse inconsistent with native English tendencies . A very great part of such verse has really only four full accents , and this we have seen to be the number of accents in the native English verse . On this point , see further remarks in connection with the specimen from Spenser , p. 180 below .</p>
   <p>This verse appears in two great divisions , rimed ( the decasyllabic couplet ) and unrimed ( blank verse ) . The rimed form was the earlier , the unrimed being merely a modification of it under the influence of other unrimed metres .</p>

   <p>With Chaucer we have the first deliberate use of the five-stress couplet , in continuous verse , known to English poetry . His earliest use of the pentameter line was in the Compleynt to Pitee ( perhaps written about 1371 ) , in the “ rime royal ” stanza ; his earliest use of the pentameter couplet was in the Legend of Good Women , usually dated 1385 . From that time the measure became almost his only instrument , and we find altogether in his poetry some 16 , 000 lines in the couplet , besides some 14 , 000 more in rime royal . Too much praise cannot be given Chaucer 's use of the couplet . Although it was an experiment in English verse , it has perhaps hardly been used since his time with greater skill . He used a variety of cesuras ( see ten Brink 's monograph for the enumeration of them ) , a very large number of feminine endings ( such as the still pronounced final-e and similar syllables easily provided ) , free inversions in the first foot and elsewhere , and many run-on lines ( in a typical 100 lines some 16 run-on lines and 7 run-on couplets appearing ) . The total effect is one of combined freedom and mastery , of fluent conversational style yet within the limits of guarded artistic form . “ Much more regularly than the French and Provençals , and yet without pedantic stiffness , he made his verse advance with a sort of iambic gait , and he was therefore able to give up and exchange for a freer arrangement the immovable cesura , which these poets had always made to coincide with a foot-ending . ” ( Ten Brink , in English Literature , Kennedy trans ., vol . ii . p . 48 . ) On Chaucer 's verse , see , besides the monograph of ten Brink already cited , Lounsbury 's Studies in Chaucer , vol . iii . pp . 297 ff ., and Schipper , vol . i. pp . 442 ff .</p>
   <p>The common assumption is , that Chaucer borrowed the pentameter couplet directly from French poetry . On the history of this in France , see Stengel , in Gröber 's Grundriss der Romanischen Philologie .<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>The decasyllabic verse was fairly common in France in the fourteenth century ( being called “ vers commun ” according to Stengel ) ; but in the form of the couplet it was not . Professor Skeat says : “ To say that it [ Chaucer 's couplet ] was derived from the French ten-syllable verse is not a complete solution of the mystery ; for nearly all such verse is commonly either in stanzas , or else a great number of successive lines are rimed together ; and these , I believe , are rather scarce . After some search I have , however , fortunately lighted upon a very interesting specimen , among the poems of Guillaume de Machault , a French writer whom Chaucer is known to have imitated , and who died in 1377 . In the edition of Machault 's poems edited by Tarbé , Reims and Paris , 1849 , p. 89 , there is a poem of exactly this character , of no great length , but fortunately dated ; for its title is ‘ Complainte écrite après la bataille de Poitiers et avant le siège de Reims par les Anglais ’ ( 1356-1358 ) . The first four lines run thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ A toy , Henry , dous amis , me complain ,</l>
     <l n="2">Pour ce que ne cueur ne mont ne plein ;</l>
     <l n="3">Car a piet suy , sans cheval et sans selle ,</l>
     <l n="4">Et si n'ay mais esmeraude , ne belle . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>... Now as Chaucer was taken prisoner in France in 1359 , he had an excellent opportunity for making himself acquainted with this poem , and with others , possibly , in a similar metre , which have not come down to us . ” ( The Prioress 's Tale , Introduction , pp . xix , xx . ) Paris has shown that the real date of the poem in question was 1340 ; the title quoted by Skeat is Tarbé 's modern French caption . Professor Kittredge has called my attention to the fact that there is another poem of Machault 's in the same metre ( P. Paris 's edition of Voir-Dit , p. 56 ) , and also a poem by Froissart , the “ Orloge Amoureus . ”</p>
   <p>Ten Brink calls attention to the possibility of the influence upon Chaucer 's couplet of the Italian hendecasyllabic verse . The Compleynte to Pitee , it is true , was written probably before the Italian journey of 1372-1373 ; but in Italy the “ full significance ” of the metre may have become clear to Chaucer . “ After that journey the heroic verse appears almost exclusively as his poetic instrument .... Of still greater significance is the fact that Chaucer 's heroic verse differs from the French decasyllabic in all the particulars in which the Italian hendecasyllabic departs from the common source , and approaches the verse of Dante and Boccaccio as closely as the metre of a Germanic language can approach a Romance metre . It may be added also that the heroic verse in the Compleynte to Pitee stands nearer the French decasyllabic than that of the Troilus or the Canterbury Tales . ”</p>
   <p>Dr. Lewis , on the other hand , in The Foreign Sources of English Versification , would minimize the foreign sources of Chaucer 's couplet . Not only the unaccentual character of the French verse is opposed to the theory of the French source , but also , he believes , the fixed cesura . “ In the English verse there is no such thing : indeed there is no cesura at all , in the French sense of the word .... Schipper relegates to a foot-note the suggestion that our heroic verse may have originated in a different way , either through an abridgment of the alexandrine or through an extension of the four-foot line . This is of course more nearly the true view , but it is entirely immaterial which of the last two explanations we hit upon . Accentual verses of four , six , and seven feet were already familiar long before Chaucer 's time . They exhibited a more or less regular alternation of arsis and thesis . To devise a verse which should be essentially the same in principle , but should have five accents instead of four , six , or seven , was a task that Chaucer 's genius might well achieve unaided ” ( pp . 98 , 99 ) .</p>
   <p>It is quite possible that a combination of all these views may be nearest the truth . The objection to the French influence on the ground of the syllabic ( non-accentual ) quality of the French verse does not seem to be serious , since any imitation of French verse by an Englishman would be likely to take on the accentual form ; and , that once done , the need for the fixed cesura would vanish . But it is worth while to emphasize the fact that the genius of English verse was not so averse to the formation of a decasyllabic five-stress line as to make it a serious innovation . This view is further emphasized by the next specimen .</p>

   <p>This specimen is properly not in five-stress verse , but in irregular four-stress ( “ tumbling verse ” ) ; compare the specimen on p. 158 , above . We have a close approach , however , to the regular five-stress verse , in such lines as the fourth , fifth , eleventh , thirteenth , and seventeenth . On this and similar passages in the Shepherd 's Calendar , as illustrating the close relation between the native measure and the newer one , see an article by Professor Gummere , in the American Journal of Philology , vol . vii . pp . 53ff . Other verses cited by Dr. Gummere are :</p>
   <p>“ Whose way is wildernesse , whose ynne Penaunce . ”</p>
   <p>“ And dirks the beauty of my blossomes rownd . ”</p>
   <p>“ That oft the blood springeth from woundes wyde . ”</p>
   <p>“ There at the dore he cast me downe hys pack . ”</p>
   <p>It is pointed out that the regular five-stress line , when having — as very frequently — only four full stresses ( two or three light syllables coming together , especially at the pause ) , can hardly be distinguished from certain forms of the native four-stress verse . See also the Eclogues for February and August , in the Shepherd 's Calendar . Dr. Gummere 's conclusion is , that “ practically all the elements of Anglo-Saxon verse are preserved in our modern poetry , though in different combinations , with changed proportional importance . ”</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Joseph Hall was the most vigorous satirist of the group of Elizabethans who , in the last decade of the sixteenth century , were imitating the satires of Horace , Juvenal , and Persius . Hall 's satires have a curiously eighteenth-century flavor , and his couplets are frequently very similar to those of the age of Pope . Thus Thomas Warton ( in his History of English Poetry ) observed of Hall that “ the fabric of the couplets approaches to the modern standard ; ” and Anderson , who edited the British Poets in 1795 , said : “ Many of his lines would do honor to the most harmonious of our modern poets . The sense has generally such a pause , and will admit of such a punctuation at the close of the second line , as if it were calculated for a modern ear . ” On the verse of these Elizabethan satirists in general , see The Rise of Formal Satire in England , by the present editor ( Publications of the Univ . of Penna . ) .</p>
   <p>On the other hand , the verse of the satires of John Donne , from which the following specimen is taken , is the roughest and most difficult of all the satires of the group . The reputation of Donne 's satires for metrical ruggedness has affected unjustly that of his other poetry and that of the Elizabethan satires in general . Dryden said : “ Would not Donne 's Satires , which abound with so much wit , appear more charming if he had taken care of his words and of his numbers ? ” ( Essay on Satire . ) And Pope “ versified ” two of them , so as to bring them into a form pleasing to the ear of his age .</p>

   <p>The use of rimed couplets in Shakspere 's dramas is especially characteristic of his earlier work . In this play , Love 's Labor 's Lost , Dowden says , “ there are about two rhymed lines to every one of blank verse ” ( Shakspere Primer , p. 44 ) . In the late plays , on the other hand , rime disappears almost altogether . It will be observed that while Shakspere 's heroic verse is usually fairly regular , with not very many run-on lines , it yet differs in quality from that of satires . The dramatic use moulds it into different cadences , and the single couplet is , perhaps , less noticeably the unit of the verse .</p>

   <p>Jonson is thought by some to have been the founder of the classical school of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , which made the heroic couplet peculiarly its own . See on this subject an article by Prof. F. E. Schelling , “ Ben Jonson and the Classical School , ” in the Publications of the Modern Language Association , n. s. vol . vi . p. 221 . Professor Schelling finds in Jonson 's verse all the characteristics of the later couplet of Waller and Dryden : end-stopped lines and couplets , a preference for medial cesura , and an antithetical structure of the verse . “ No better specimen of Jonson 's antithetical manner could be found , ” he says further , than the Epigram here quoted . So far as this antithetical quality of Jonson 's verse is concerned , Professor Schelling 's view cannot be questioned ; but that Jonson shows any singular preference for end-stopped lines and couplets may be seriously questioned .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Edmund Waller is the chief representative of the early classical poetry of the seventeenth century , and of the polishing and regulating of the couplet which prepared the way for the verse of Dryden and Pope . The dominant characteristic of this verse is its avoidance of enjambement , or run-on lines , still more of run-on couplets . The growing precision of French verse at the same time was perhaps influential in England . Malherbe , who was at the French court after 1605 , set rules for more regular verse , and forbade , among other things , the use of run-on lines — a precept which held good in French poetry until the nineteenth century . The influence of Waller in England was , for a considerable period , hardly less than that of Malherbe in France . Dryden said that “ the excellence and dignity ” of rime “ were never known till Mr. Waller taught it ; he first made writing easily an art ; first showed us to conclude the sense most commonly in distichs , which , in the verse of those before him , runs on for so many lines together that the reader is out of breath to overtake it . This sweetness of Mr. Waller 's lyric poesy was afterward followed , in the epic , by Sir John Denham , in his Cooper 's Hill . ” ( Epistle Dedicatory of The Rival Ladies . ) In another place Dryden observed that only Waller , in English , had surpassed Spenser in the harmony of his verse . Dryden 's view was later echoed by Pope , who exhorted his readers to</p>
   <p>“ praise the easy vigor of a line Where Denham 's strength and Waller 's sweetness join . ”</p>
   <p>( Essay on Criticism , l . 360 . )</p>
   <p>But the most remarkable praise of Waller is found in the Preface to his posthumous poems , 1690 , generally attributed to Bishop Atterbury . “ He was indeed the parent of English verse , and the first that shewed us our tongue had beauty and numbers in it .... The tongue came into his hands like a rough diamond ; he polished it first , and to that degree that all artists since him have admired the workmanship , without pretending to mend it .... He undoubtedly stands first in the list of refiners , and for aught I know , last , too ; for I question whether in Charles the Second 's reign English did not come to its full perfection ; and whether it has not had its Augustan Age , as well as the Latin .... We are no less beholding to him for the new turn of verse , which he brought in , and the improvement he made in our numbers . Before his time men rhymed , indeed , and that was all : as for the harmony of measure , and that dance of words which good ears are so much pleased with , they knew nothing of it . Their poetry then was made up almost entirely of monosyllables , which , when they come together in any cluster , are certainly the most harsh , untunable things in the world . If any man doubts of this , let him read ten lines in Donne , and he 'll quickly be convinced . Besides , their verses ran all into one another , and hung together , throughout a whole copy , like the hook't atoms that compose a body in Des Cartes . There was no distinction of parts , no regular stops , nothing for the ear to rest upon . But as soon as the copy began , down it went like a larum , incessantly ; and the reader was sure to be out of breath before he got to the end of it . So that really verse in those days was but downright prose , tagged with rhymes . Mr. Waller removed all these faults , brought in more polysyllables and smoother measures , bound up his thoughts better and in a cadence more agreeable to the nature of the verse he wrote in : so that wherever the natural stops of that were , he contrived the little breakings of his sense so as to fall in with ‘ em . And for that reason , since the stress of our verse lies commonly upon the last syllable , you 'll hardly ever find him using a word of no force there . "[ 21 ] Waller 's editor thus clearly discerns the very characteristics of his verse which are avoided by the master-poets — the coincidence of phrase-pauses and verse-pauses , and regularity in the placing of stress .</p>
   <p>The most important discussion of the influence of Waller on English poetry , and on the heroic couplet in particular , is found in Mr. Gosse 's book , From Shakespeare to Pope . Mr. Gosse regards Waller as inventing for himself the couplet of the classical school ; “ master , ” in 1623 , of such verse as “ was not imitated by a single poet for nearly twenty years ” ( p. 50 ) . This view is criticised in an interesting article by Dr. Henry Wood , in the American Journal of Philology , vol . xi . p. 55 . While Mr. Gosse places Waller 's earliest couplets in 1621 and 1623 , Dr. Wood would date them as late as 1626 , and shows that Waller wrote nothing else until 1635 . Meantime had appeared ( the first volume at least as early as 1623 ) the translation of Ovid 's Metamorphoses , by George Sandys , in which , says Wood , all the characteristics of Waller 's verse appear . “ At all events , ” is his conclusion , “ it was Sandys , and not Waller , who at the beginning of the third decade of the century , first of all Englishmen , made a uniform practice of writing in heroic couplets , which are , on the whole , in accord with the French rule , and which , for exactness of construction , and for harmonious sification , go far towards satisfying the demands of the later ‘ classical ’ school in England . ” Dr. Wood emphasizes the probable influence of the French poets on these early heroic couplets , calling attention to the fact that Sandys was in France in 1610 . There is no evidence , however , that he was there for more than a few days , en route to more eastern countries . Waller was not in France till 1643 . The whole question of the influence of French poetry in England before the Restoration still remains to be carefully investigated . Meantime , the cautious student will hesitate to put too much stress on any single point of departure for the new style of versification . Many influences must have combined to make it popular . We have seen Professor Schelling emphasizing the influence of Jonson ; he also very justly points out “ that it is a mistake to consider that the Elizabethans often practised the couplet with the freedom , not to say license , that characterizes its nineteenth century use in the hands of such poets as Keats . ” Compare the couplets of even so romantic a poet as Marlowe , in the specimen given above from Hero and Leander . And even Mr. Gosse , in partial divergence from the doctrines of From Shakespeare to Pope , says of the satiric verse of the Elizabethan Rowlands : “ There are lines in this passage which Pope would not have disdained to use . It might , indeed , be employed as against that old heresy , not even yet entirely discarded , that smoothness of heroic verse was the invention of Waller . As a matter of fact , this , as well as all other branches of the universal art of poetry , was understood by the great Elizabethan masters ; and if they did not frequently employ it , it was because they left to such humbler writers as Rowlands an instrument incapable of those noble and audacious harmonies on which they chiefly prided themselves . ” ( Introduction to the Works of Rowlands , Hunterian Club ed ., p . 16 . )</p>
   <p>A tribute to the incoming influence of the couplet is cited by Dr. Wood from the poems of Sir John Beaumont ( 1582-1627 ) . In his verses To His Late Majesty , concerning the True Forme of English Poetry , Beaumont said :</p>

   <p>“ Oldham was the first , ” says Mr. Gosse , “ to liberate himself , in the use of the distich , from this under-current of a stanza , and to write heroic verse straight on , couplet by couplet , ascending by steady strides and not by irregular leaps . ( Any one who will venture to read Oldham 's disagreeable Satire upon the Jesuits , written in 1679 , will see the truth of this remark , and note the effect that its versification had upon that series of Dryden 's satires which immediately followed it . ) In Pope 's best satires we see this art carried to its final perfection ; after his time the connecting link between couplet and couplet became lost , and at last in the decline poems became , as some one has said , mere cases of lancets lying side by side . But in Dryden 's day the connection was still only too obvious , and it strikes me that it may have been from a consciousness of this defect , that Dryden adopted that triplet , with a final alexandrine , which he is so fond of introducing . ” ( From Shakespeare to Pope , p . 201 . )</p>

   <p>On Dryden 's development of the couplet , see especially Saintsbury 's Life of Dryden ( English Men of Letters Series ) , pp . 17 , 171 . “ The whole structure of the decasyllabic line before the middle of the seventeenth century was ill calculated for the perfecting of the couplet . Accustomed either to the stately plainness of blank verse , or to the elaborate intricacies of the stanza , writers had got into the habit of communicating to their verse a slow and somewhat languid movement . ” ( p . 17 . ) “ In versification the great achievement of Dryden was the alteration of what may be called the balance of the line , causing it to run more quickly , and to strike its rhymes with a sharper and less prolonged sound . One obvious means of obtaining this was , as a matter of course , the isolation of the couplet , and the avoidance of overlapping the different lines one upon the other . The effect of this overlapping , by depriving the eye and voice of the expectation of rest at the end of each couplet , is always one of two things . Either the lines are converted into a sort of rhythmic prose , made musical by the rhymes rather than divided by them , or else a considerable pause is invited at the end of each , or of most lines , and the cadence of the whole becomes comparatively slow and languid . Both these forms , as may be seen in the works of Mr. Morris , as well as in the older writers , are excellently suited for narration of some considerable length . They are less well suited for satire , for argument , and for the moral reflections which the age of Dryden loved . He therefore set himself to elaborate the couplet with its sharp point , its quick delivery , and the pistol-like detonation of its rhyme . But there is an obvious objection , or rather there are several obvious objections which present themselves to the couplet . It was natural that to one accustomed to the more varied range of the older rhythm and metre , there might seem to be a danger of the snip-snap monotony into which , as we know , it did actually fall when it passed out of the hands of its first great practitioners . There might also be a fear that it would not always be possible to compress the sense of a complete clause within the narrow limits of twenty syllables . To meet these difficulties Dryden resorted to three mechanical devices — the hemistich , the alexandrine , and the triplet , all three of which could be used indifferently to eke out the space or to give variety of sound .... In poetry proper the hemistich is anything but pleasing , and Dryden , becoming convinced of the fact , almost discarded it . The alexandrine and the triplet he always continued to use . ” ( pp . 171 , 172 . )</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The use of the heroic couplet in the drama marks its effort to conquer the last citadel of English poetry ; an attempt which , under the leadership of Dryden , seemed to succeed , but soon gave way to better judgment . Dryden favored the experiment in the Preface to The Rival Ladies ( 1663 ) , and inserted a few couplets in that play . Etheredge accepted the suggestion , and put the serious parts of The Comical Revenge ( largely prose ) into couplets , in 1664 . In the same year The Indian Queen ( by Dryden and Sir Robert Howard ) appeared in heroic verse , and the fashion soon became so general that in the Essay on Heroic Plays , prefixed to The Conquest of Granada ( 1672 ) , Dryden could say : “ Whether Heroic Verse ought to be admitted into serious plays , is not now to be disputed : ‘ tis already in possession of the stage ; and I dare confidently affirm , that very few tragedies , in this age , shall be received without it . ” Only six years later , however , in 1678 , he returned to blank verse in All for Love , saying : “ I have disencumbered myself from rhyme . Not that I condemn my former way , but that this is more proper to my present purpose . ” In all about five plays of Dryden 's are in couplets ; after 1678 he rarely returned to rime for the drama . As Atterbury said in his Preface to Waller 's poems : “ ‘ Twas the strength of his genius that first brought it into credit in plays ; and ‘ tis the force of his example that has thrown it out again . ” “ The fashion of rhyme in the drama , then , to be exact , ” says Mr. Gosse , “ flourished from 1664 until ... 1678 . ” Some justification for its use is to be found in the wretched condition into which blank verse had fallen . “ The blank iambics of the romantic dramatists had become so execrably weak and distended , the whole movement of dramatic verse had grown so flaccid , that a little restraint in the severe limits of rhyme was absolutely necessary . ” ( Gosse , in Seventeenth Century Studies , p . 264 . )</p>
   <p>The present specimen is from a play in which the couplet was used but slightly ; but it shows Dryden 's use of it at its best . In the drama , as already remarked , the couplet is naturally less epigrammatic and pointed than in didactic and satiric verse .</p>
   <p>For the arguments with which Dryden defended the use of rime in the drama , see the Preface to The Rival Ladies , the Essay of Heroic Plays , the Essay of Dramatic Poesy , and the Defence of an Essay of Dramatic Poesy . “ In the quickness of reparties ( which in discoursive scenes fall very often ) , it has so particular a grace , and is so aptly suited to them , that the sudden smartness of the answer , and the sweetness of the rhyme , set off the beauty of each other . But that benefit which I consider most in it , because I have not seldom found it , is , that it bounds and circumscribes the fancy . ” ( Essays of Dryden , ed . W. P. Ker , vol . i. p . 8 . ) In the Essay of Dramatic Poesy , Crites , representing Sir Robert Howard , opposes the use of rime on the ground of Aristotle 's dictum that tragedy is best written in the kind of verse which is nearest prose . A play being an imitation of Nature , “ the nearer anything comes to the imitation of it , the more it pleases . ” Neander , representing Dryden , answers that this line of argument will equally forbid blank verse . Blank verse is “ properly but measured prose ” ; and rime may be “ made as natural as blank verse , by the well placing of the words , etc . ” “ But I need not go so far to prove that rhyme , as it succeeds to all other offices of Greek and Latin verse , so especially to this of plays , since the custom of all nations at this day confirms it , all the French , Italian , and Spanish tragedies are generally writ in it ; and sure the universal consent of the most civilized parts of the world ought in this , as it doth in other customs , to include the rest . ” ( Ibid . p . 98 . ) Again , while a play is a representation of Nature , it is “ Nature wrought up to an higher pitch ” ; and for this purpose “ heroic rhyme is nearest Nature , as being the noblest kind of modern verse . ” ( pp . 100 , 101 . ) In the Essay of Heroic Plays Dryden again summarizes the case for the other side by saying that “ all the arguments which are formed against it can amount to no more than this , that it is not so near conversation as prose , and therefore not so natural . But it is very clear to all who understand Poetry , that serious plays ought not to imitate conversation too nearly . ” If , therefore , we begin to leave the mere “ imitation of ordinary converse , ” we should go on consistently to “ the last perfection of Art . It was only custom which cozened us so long ; we thought , because Shakespeare and Fletcher went no farther , that there the pillars of poetry were to be erected ; that , because they excellently described passion without rhyme , therefore rhyme was not capable of describing it . But time has now convinced most men of that error . ” ( Ibid . pp . 148 , 149 . )</p>
   <p>Dryden was of course quite right in objecting to the claim that imaginative poetry ought to seek the form closest to the language of real life . The real question is whether rimed verse is a more imaginative and highly poetic form than blank verse ; modern opinion would unanimously answer in the negative .</p>
   <p>It strikes a modern reader as curious that Dryden and his contemporaries should have advocated the use of rime in tragedy rather than in comedy ; but we have the clew to their feeling in the saying that “ serious plays ought not to imitate conversation too nearly . ” In the Restoration period the comedy was thought of as a realistic representation of life ; hence its characters should speak in natural prose , as they have continued to do , for the most part , ever since . The tragedy or heroic play , on the other hand , was in the region of artistic convention , much farther removed from reality ; hence its language was to be “ raised above the life . ” This distinction between the range of comedy and that of tragedy , which would have seemed strange to the Elizabethans , explains the widely diverging lines which we find the two forms of the drama following from the time of the Restoration .</p>

   <p>Pope 's couplet , while less vigorous and varied than Dryden 's , has been generally considered the most perfect development of the typical measure of the classical school . Mr. Courthope thinks that in this speech from the Iliad , Pope “ perhaps attains the highest level of which the heroic couplet is capable . ” ( Works of Pope , vol . v. p . 167 . )</p>
   <p>“ What he learned from Dryden , ” Mr. Courthope says in another place , “ was the art of expressing the social and conversational idiom of the language in a metrical form . His conception of metrical harmony was , however , altogether different from his professed master 's , and rather resembled that of Sandys , whose translation of Ovid 's Metamorphoses he told Spence he had read when very young , and with the greatest delight . He explains the system in a letter to Cromwell , dated November 25 , 1710 .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ ( 1 ) As to the hiatus , it is certainly to be avoided as often as possible ; but on the other hand , since the reason of it is only for the sake of the numbers , so if , to avoid it , we incur another fault against their smoothness , methinks the very end of that nicety is destroyed ....</p>
   <p>“ ‘ ( 2 ) I would except against the use of all expletives in verse , as do before verbs plural , or even the frequent use of did or does to change the termination of the rhyme ....</p>
   <p>“ ‘ ( 3 ) Monosyllable lines , unless very artfully managed , are stiff , languishing , and hard .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ ( 4 ) The repeating the same rhymes within four or six lines of each other , which tire the ear with too much of the like sound .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ ( 5 ) The too frequent use of alexandrines , which are never graceful , but where there is some majesty added to the verse by them , or when there cannot be found a word in them but what is absolutely needful .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ ( 6 ) Every nice ear must , I believe , have observed that in any smooth English verse of ten syllables , there is naturally a pause either at the fourth , fifth , or sixth syllables .... Now I fancy that , to preserve an exact harmony and variety , none of these pauses should be continued above three lines together , without the interposition of another ; else it will be apt to weary the ear with one continued tone . ’ ”</p>
   <p>( Ibid . pp . 20 , 21 . )</p>
   <p>Here are implied all the characteristics of the Popean couplet . The cesura is to vary , but not from a fundamentally medial position . The avoidance of enjambement is not mentioned , doubtless because it is assumed as an essential of couplets professing any degree of correctness .</p>

   <p>“ The heroic couplet , ” says Mr. Gosse , “ was never employed , even by Pope himself , with more melody than by Goldsmith in this poem . ” ( Eighteenth Century Literature , p . 320 . ) Its use at this time , when the revival of blank verse by Thomson and others had seriously affected the prestige of the couplet , was a sign of Goldsmith 's reactionary tendency toward the school of Pope . His dislike of blank verse he expressed in his early work on the Present State of Polite Learning , saying that it might be reckoned among “ several disagreeable instances of pedantry ” lately proceeding “ from a desire in the critic of grafting the spirit of ancient languages upon the English . ” ( Works , Globe ed ., p . 439 . ) This opinion was of course shared by Goldsmith 's friend , Dr. Johnson , whose two important poems ( London and The Vanity of Human Wishes ) stand with the two of Goldsmith as the last notable pieces of English poetry of the classical school . While Johnson admitted that he could not “ wish that Milton had been a rhymer , ” yet he never lost an opportunity to speak contemptuously of blank verse as a poetic form , and quoted approvingly the saying of a critic that it “ seems to be verse only to the eye . ” ( Life of Milton . )</p>

   <p>Crabbe 's poems are the latest to use the strict Popean couplet for narrative and descriptive purposes , and his couplets have a certain characteristic reticence and vigor . Professor Woodberry praises them in an interesting passage on “ the old heroic rhymed couplet , that simplest form of English verse music , which could rise , nevertheless , to the almost lyric loftiness of the last lines of the Dunciad ; so supple and flexible ; made for easy simile and compact metaphor ; lending itself so perfectly to the sudden flash of wit or turn of humor ; the natural shell of an epigram ; compelling the poet to practice all the virtues of brevity ; checking the wandering fancy , and repressing the secondary thought ; requiring in a masterly use of it the employment of more mental powers than any other metrical form ; despised and neglected now because the literature which is embodied in it is despised and neglected , yet the best metrical form which intelligence , as distinct from poetical feeling , can employ . ” ( Makers of Literature , p . 104 . )</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Of this poem Mr. C. H. Herford says : “ The Story of Rimini is the starting-point of that free or Chaucerian treatment of the heroic couplet , and of the colloquial style , eschewing epigram and full of familiar turns , which Shelley in Julian and Maddalo and Keats in Lamia made classical . ” ( Age of Wordsworth , p . 83 . ) The treatment of the couplet is still characterized by but slight use of run-on lines , and a preference for the medial cesura ; but on the other hand there is a large degree of freedom in the inversion of accents and other alterations of the regular stress . Compare the last line of the present specimen , and such other lines as</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Of crimson cloths hanging a hand of snow . ”</l>
     <l n="2">“ Some , with a drag , dangling from the cap 's crest . ”</l>
     <l n="3">“ ‘ Who 's there ? ’ said that sweet voice , kindly and clear . ”</l>
     <l n="4">“ The other with the tears streaming down both his cheeks . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The last of these lines , an alexandrine , is also characteristic . Hunt imitated Dryden in the use of both alexandrine and triplet . Of the latter he said : “ I confess I like the very bracket that marks out the triplet to the reader 's eye , and prepares him for the music of it . It has a look like the bridge of a lute . ” ( Preface to Works , 1832 . ) Mr. A. J. Kent , in an article in the Fortnightly Review , says of Leigh Hunt that “ he became the greatest master since the days of Dryden ” of the heroic couplet . ( 1881 , p . 224 . )</p>

   <p>In the couplet of Keats , and of a number of his successors , we have a really different measure from the “ heroic couplet ” proper . The individual line and the couplet alike cease to be prominent units of the verse . The effect is therefore closely allied to that of blank verse ; the rimes , not being emphasized by marked pauses , serving rather as means of tone color than as organizers of the verse . See Mr. Saintsbury 's remarks ( quoted in the notes on Dryden , p. 195 , above ) , on “ lines made musical by the rhymes rather than divided by them . ” In like manner Mr. Symonds says that “ the couplets of Marlowe , Fletcher , Shelley , and Keats follow the laws of blank verse , and add rhyme — that is to say , their periods and pauses are entirely determined by the sense . ” ( Blank Verse , p . 66 . ) This is true of the couplets of Shelley and Keats , and to a less degree of those of Fletcher 's Faithful Shepherdess , but will hardly apply to Marlowe , nor , as we have seen , to the Elizabethans in general .<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span></p>

   <p>B .— BLANK VERSE</p>
   <p>Unrimed five-stress verse early became the accepted form for English dramatic poetry , and in the modern English period has become the favorite form for long continuous poems , narrative and reflective as well . In general , as will appear from the specimens , it is marked not only by the absence of rime but by a prevalent freedom of structure rarely found in the couplet .</p>
   <p>The impetus toward the writing of blank verse seems to have been given by the influence of classical humanism , the representatives of which grew sceptical as to the use of rime , on the ground that it was not found in classical poetry . In Italy Giovanni Trissino wrote his Sophonisbe and Italia Liberata ( 1515-1548 ) in rimeless verses , and was looked upon as the inventor of versi sciolti , i. e . verses “ freed ” from rime . ( See Schipper , vol . ii . p . 4 . ) See also below , in the notes on Surrey , and later under Imitations of Classical Verse , for notes on the same movement .</p>
   <p>On the nature of English blank verse , see J . A. Symonds 's Blank Verse ( 1895 ) , a reprint of essays in the Appendix to his Sketches and Studies in Southern Europe . In his Chapters on English Metre ( chap . iv . ) , Mr. J . B . Mayor criticises what he calls Mr. Symonds 's “ æsthetic intuitivism . ”</p>

   <p>Of Mr. Symonds 's remarks on the general nature of blank verse the following are especially interesting : “ English blank verse is perhaps more various and plastic than any other national metre . It is capable of being used for the most commonplace and the most sublime utterances .... Originally instituted for the drama , it received in Milton 's hands an epical treatment , and has by authors of our own day been used for idyllic and even for lyrical compositions . Plato mentions a Greek musical instrument called panharmonion , which was adapted to express the different modes and systems of melodious utterance . This name might be applied to our blank verse ; there is no harmony of sound , no dignity of movement , no swiftness , no subtlety of languid sweetness , no brevity , no force of emphasis , beyond its scope . ” ( Blank Verse , pp . 16 , 17 . )</p>
   <p>“ It seems adapted specially for thought in evolution ; it requires progression and sustained effort . As a consequence of this , its melody is determined by the sense which it contains , and depends more upon proportion and harmony of sounds than upon recurrences and regularities of structure .... Another point about blank verse is that it admits of no mediocrity ; it must be either clay or gold .... Hence , we find that blank verse has been the metre of genius , that it is only used successfully by indubitable poets , and that it is no favorite in a mean , contracted , and unimaginative age . The freedom of the renaissance created it in England . The freedom of our century has reproduced it . Blank verse is a type and symbol of our national literary spirit — uncontrolled by precedent or rule , inclined to extravagance , yet reaching perfection at intervals by an inner force and vivida vis of native inspiration . ” ( Ibid . pp . 70-72 . )</p>
   <p>The earliest use of the term “ blank verse , ” noted in the New English Dictionary , is in Nash 's Preface to Greene 's Menaphon , 1589 : “ the swelling bumbast of bragging blanke verse . ” Some ten years later Shakspere used it in Much Ado about Nothing , V . ii ., where Benedick speaks of those heroes “ whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of blank verse , ” but will not rime easily . In Chapman 's All Fools ( 1605 ) the young gallant , in describing his manifold accomplishments , says he could write</p>

   <p>Surrey 's translation of two books of the Æneid may have been suggested by the translation ( 1541 ) made by Francesco Maria Molza , attributed at the time to Cardinal Ippolito de Medici . This was in Italian unrimed verse . ( See Henry Morley 's First Sketch of English Literature , p. 294 , and his English Writers , vol . viii . p . 61 . ) The verse of Surrey , like Wyatt 's , shows a somewhat mechanical adherence to the syllable-counting principle , in contrast to regard for accents .<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>Thus we find such lines as :</p>

   <p>This tragedy , although Dryden curiously instanced it in defence of the use of rime on the stage , was the earliest English drama in blank verse . The metre is decidedly more monotonous than Surrey 's , and gives little hint of the possibilities of the measure for dramatic expression . In general , the early experiments in blank verse suggest — what they must often have seemed to their writers — the mere use of the decasyllabic couplet deprived of its rime . Nevertheless , as Mr. Symonds remarks of a passage in Gorboduc , “ we yet may trace variety and emphasis in the pauses of these lines beyond what would at that epoch have been possible in sequences of rhymed couplets . ” ( Blank Verse , p . 20 . )</p>

   <p>Marlowe is universally and rightly regarded as the first English poet who used blank verse with the hand of a master , and showed its possibilities . With him it became practically a new measure . Mr. Symonds says : “ He found the ten-syllabled heroic line monotonous , monosyllabic , and divided into five feet of tolerably regular alternate short and long . He left it various in form and structure , sometimes redundant by a syllable , sometimes deficient , enriched with unexpected emphases and changes in the beat . He found no sequence or attempt at periods ; one line succeeded another with insipid regularity , and all were made after the same model . He grouped his verse according to the sense , obeying an internal law of melody , and allowing the thought contained in his words to dominate their form .... Used in this fashion , blank verse became a Proteus . It resembled music , which requires regular time and rhythm ; but , by the employment of phrase , induces a higher kind of melody to rise above the common and despotic beat of time .... It is true that , like all great poets , he left his own peculiar imprint on it , and that his metre is marked by an almost extravagant exuberance , impetuosity , and height of coloring . ” ( Blank Verse , pp . 22-27 . ) In the earlier verse of Tamburlaine , while showing these new qualities of a metrical master , Marlowe yet kept pretty closely to the individual , end-stopped line ; in his later verse , as illustrated in the fragmentary text of Faustus , he seems to have attained much more freedom , resembling that of the later plays of Shakspere .<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span></p>

   <p>No attempt can be made to represent adequately the blank verse of Shakspere . The specimens , chosen respectively from his earlier , middle , and later periods , illustrate the trend of development of his verse . In the earlier period it was characterized by the slight use of feminine endings and enjambement ; in the later by marked preference for both , and by general freedom and flexibility . In other words , Shakspere 's own development represents , in a sort of miniature , that of the history of dramatic blank verse . According to Furnivall 's tables , the proportion of run-on lines to end-stopped lines in The Two Gentlemen of Verona is one in ten , while in The Tempest it is one in three . The increased use of “ light ” and “ weak ” endings is closely analogous . Professor Wendell says of the verse of Cymbeline : “ End-stopped lines are so deliberately avoided that one feels a sense of relief when a speech and a line end together . Such a phrase as</p>
   <p>‘ How slow his soul sail 'd on , how swift his ship ’</p>
   <p>is deliberately made , not a single line , but two half-lines . Several times , in the broken dialogue , one has literally to count the syllables before the metrical regularity of the verse appears .... Clearly this puzzling style is decadent ; the distinction between verse and prose is breaking down . ” ( William Shakspere , p . 357 . )[ 29 ]</p>

   <p>The verse of Fletcher is highly individual among the Jacobean dramatists , though in a sense typical of the breaking down of blank verse , in the direction of prose , which was going on at this period . The distinguishing feature of Fletcher 's verse is the constant use of feminine endings , and the extension of these to triple and even quadruple endings , by the addition of one or more syllables . Twelve-syllable lines ( not alexandrines , but ordinary lines with triple endings ) are not at all uncommon ; and the additional syllable or syllables may even be emphatic . In general the tendency was in the direction of the freedom of conversational prose . Such a line as</p>
   <p>“ Methinks you are infinitely bound to her for her journey ”</p>
   <p>would not be recognized , standing by itself , as a five-stress iambic verse ; properly read , however , it takes its place without difficulty in the scheme of the metre .<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span></p>

On the other hand , one may see the dramas of Richard Brome for specimens of the decadent metre at its worst . Brome wrote comedies both in prose and verse , and there is little difference between the two forms in his hands . See also the crude and lax verse of some of the early plays of Dryden , illustrated on p. 234 below .

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The blank verse of Milton is characterized by greater freedom and flexibility than that of any earlier poet . The single line practically ceases to be the unit of the verse , which is divided rather into metrical paragraphs , or , as some would even call them , stanzas . Professor Corson quotes an interesting passage from a letter of Coleridge , giving an account of a conversation in which Wordsworth expressed his view of this sort of blank verse . “ My friend gave his definition and notion of harmonious verse , that it consisted ( the English iambic blank verse above all ) in the apt arrangement of pauses and cadences , and the sweep of whole paragraphs ,</p>
   <p>with many a winding bout Of linked sweetness long drawn out ,</p>
   <p>and not in the even flow , much less in the prominence or antithetic vigor of single lines , which were indeed injurious to the total effect , except where they were introduced for some specific purpose . ” ( Corson 's Primer of English Verse , p . 218 . ) In like manner Mr. Symonds says : “ The most sonorous passages begin and end with interrupted lines , including in one organic structure , periods , parentheses , and paragraphs of fluent melody .... In these structures there are many pauses which enable the ear and voice to rest themselves , but none are perfect , none satisfy the want created by the opening hemistich , until the final and deliberate close is reached . ” ( Blank Verse pp . 56 , 57 . )</p>
   <p>In Milton 's own prefatory note to Paradise Lost , he called his blank verse “ English heroic verse without rime . ” Rime he spoke of as “ the invention of a barbarous age , ... graced indeed since by the use of some famous modern poets , ” — not least among them , he might have said , being John Milton himself . He described also the special character of his verse in saying that “ true musical delight ... consists only in apt numbers , fit quantity of syllables , and the sense variously drawn out from one verse into another , ” — that is , by enjambement . “ This neglect then of rime so little is to be taken for a defect , ... that it rather is to be esteemed an example set , the first in English , of ancient liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage of riming . "[ 32 ]</p>
   <p>It appears from this note that Milton regarded his heroic blank verse as a different measure from the familiar dramatic blank verse . The latter he used in Samson Agonistes , the verse-structure of which will be seen to differ from that of Paradise Lost ; the most salient distinction is the more frequent use of feminine endings . Mr. Symonds remarks interestingly on the “ difference between Shaksperian and Miltonic , between dramatic and epical blank verse . The one is simple in construction and progressive , the other is complex and stationary .... The one exhibits a thought , in the process of formation , developing itself from the excited fancy of the speaker . The other presents to us an image crystallized and perfect in the poet 's mind ; the one is in time , the other in space — the one is a growing and the other a complete organism .... The one , if we may play upon a fancy , resembles Music , and the other Architecture . ” ( Blank Verse , p . 58 . )</p>

   <p>The first of these specimens of Dryden 's blank verse illustrates the loose form of it found in many of the comedies , ill distinguished from prose and used interchangeably with prose , as in the case of the late Jacobean dramatists . It was with All for Love that Dryden dropped the use of the rimed couplet in tragedy , and turned his hand toward the construction of really noble blank verse . This play was professedly an imitation of Shakspere , and the passage here quoted is a paraphrase of one in Antony and Cleopatra , II . ii . Shakspere 's blank verse doubtless exerted a good influence on the quality of Dryden 's . “ From this time on , ” says Mr. Gosse , “ Dryden 's blank verse was more severe than any which had been used , except by Milton , since Ben Jonson . ” ( Eighteenth Century Literature , p . 14 . )</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This poem was one of those connected with the revival of blank verse , for didactic poetry , near the middle of the eighteenth century . Of Blair 's verse Mr. Saintsbury says that it “ is by no means to be despised . Technically its only fault is the use and abuse of the redundant syllable . The quality ... is in every respect rather moulded upon dramatic than upon purely poetical models , and he shows little trace of imitation either of Milton , or of his contemporary , Thomson . ” ( Ward 's English Poets , vol . iii . p . 217 . )</p>

   <p>Thomson 's Seasons was undoubtedly the most influential of the poems of the blank-verse revival of this period . Saintsbury says : “ His blank verse in especial cannot receive too much commendation . With that of Milton , and that of the present Poet Laureate [ Tennyson ] , it must rank as one of the chief original models of the metre to be found in English poetry . ” ( Ward 's English Poets , vol . iii . p . 169 . )</p>

     <l n="1">Other influential poems of the same period , written in blank verse , were</l>
     <l n="2">Glover 's Leonidas ( 1737 ) , Young 's Night Thoughts ( 1742-1744 ) , and</l>
     <l n="3">Akenside 's Pleasures of the Imagination ( 1744 ) . Much earlier than</l>
     <l n="4">these had come the curious poem of John Philips on Cider ( 1708 ) .</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In general , the blank verse of all these poets shows the influence of the couplet and lacks flexibility . Thus Mr. Symonds says : “ The use of the couplet had unfitted poets for its composition . Their acquired canons of regularity , when applied to loose and flowing metre , led them astray .... Hence it followed , that when blank verse began again to be written , it found itself very much at the point where it had stood before the appearance of Marlowe . Even Thomson ... wrote stiff and languid blank verse with monosyllabic terminations and monotonous cadences — a pedestrian style . ” ( Blank Verse , pp . 61 , 62 . )[ 33 ]</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The blank verse of Cowper 's Task is admirably adapted to the theme , ” says Professor Corson . “ Cowper saw farther than any one before him had seen , into the secrets of the elaborate music of Milton 's blank verse , and availed himself of those secrets to some extent — to as far an extent as the simplicity of his themes demanded . ” ( Primer of English Verse , p . 221 . ) Professor Ward speaks , however , of the “ lumbering movement ” of Cowper 's blank verse as being in contrast to “ the neatness and ease of his rhymed couplets . ” ( English Poets , vol . iii . p . 432 . ) Cowper prided himself , not without reason , on the individuality of his blank verse . In a letter to the Rev . John Newton ( Dec. 11 , 1784 ) he said : “ Milton 's manner was peculiar . So is Thomson 's . He that should write like either of them , would , in my judgment , deserve the name of a copyist , but not of a poet .... Blank verse is susceptible of a much greater diversification of manner than verse in rhyme : and why the modern writers of it have all thought proper to cast their numbers alike , I know not . ” In another letter ( to Lady Hesketh , March 20 , 1786 ) Cowper reveals his careful study of Milton 's verse : “ When the sense requires it , or when for the sake of avoiding a monotonous cadence of the lines , of which there is always danger in so long a work , it shall appear to be prudent , I still leave a verse behind me that has some uneasiness in its formation . It is not possible to read Paradise Lost , with an ear for harmony , without being sensible of the great advantage which Milton drew from such a management .... Uncritical readers find that they perform a long journey through several hundred pages perhaps without weariness ; they find the numbers harmonious , but are not aware of the art by which that harmony is brought to pass , much less suspect that a violation of all harmony on some occasions is the very thing to which they are not a little indebted for their gratification . ”</p>

   <p>The blank verse of Tennyson is probably to be regarded as the most masterly found among modern poets .<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>Its flexibility is almost infinite , yet never unmelodious . The last of the specimens just quoted illustrates his use of blank verse for short lyrical poems ,— an unusual and notable achievement . Perhaps only Collins 's Ode to Evening can be compared with his success in this direction , and Collins used a more elaborate strophe to fill , in part , the place of rime . Of the unrimed lyrics in The Princess , Mr. Symonds says that they “ are perfect specimens of most melodious and complete minstrelsy in words . ” In the “ Tears , Idle Tears , ” he goes on to say , the verse “ is divided into periods of five lines , each of which terminates with the words ‘ days that are no more . ’ This recurrence of sound and meaning is a substitute for rhyme , and suggests rhyme so persuasively that it is impossible to call the poem mere blank verse . ” See also the specimens on p. 144 above .</p>
   <p>In the case of both Tennyson and Browning the student should compare the form of the narrative blank verse on the one hand with that of the dramatic on the other . Yet in a sense all Browning 's blank verse is dramatic . It is no less flexible than Tennyson 's , but ( as in most of Browning 's poetry ) sacrifices more of melody in adapting itself to the thought .</p>

   <p>The blank verse of Stephen Phillips is the most important — one may say perhaps the only important — that has been written since Tennyson 's ; and it is of especial interest as forming an actual revival of the form on the English stage . Aside from the dramas , it is seen at its best in Marpessa . Imitating Milton , and at the same time handling the measure with original force , Mr. Phillips introduces unusual cadences , for which he has been severely reproached by the critics . Such lines as the following are typical of these variations from the normal rhythm :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ O all fresh out of beautiful sunlight . ”</l>

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>One may easily find other instances of the sporadic appearance of the same measure in the midst of irregular “ long lines ” or rough alexandrines and septenaries . Compare , for example , the following , from early plays in Manly 's Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama :</p>
   <p>“ To be alone , nor very convenyent . ” “ Ye shall not touche yt , for that I forbede . ” “ But ye shuld be as godes resydent . ” “ And many a chaumbyr thou xalt have therinne . ” “ In this flood spylt is many a mannys blood . ” “ Therfore be we now cast in ryght grett care . ”</p>
   <p>The context of many of these lines shows that they were intended to be read as four-stress rather than five-stress ; but such examples serve to make clear how easily English rhythm would fall into the decasyllabic line .</p>

    <head>III . SIX-STRESS AND SEVEN-STRESS VERSE</head>
    <head>A .— THE ALEXANDRINE ( IAMBIC HEXAMETER )</head>
    <head>The alexandrine was introduced into English from French verse , as early ( according to Schipper ) as the early part of the thirteenth century . Early poems in this metre alone , however , are almost wholly wanting , if they ever existed . The early alexandrines usually appear in conjunction with the septenary ( seven-stress verse ) . The French alexandrine has almost always been characterized by a regular and strongly marked medial cesura , and this very commonly appears in the English form , but by no means universally .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The French alexandrine is of uncertain origin . Kawczynski would trace it</l>
     <l n="2">to the classical Asclepiadean verse , as in</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Mæcenas atavis edite regibus , ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>which at least has the requisite number of syllables . It appeared in France as early as the first part of the twelfth century , and in four-line stanzas was the favorite for didactic poetry as late as the beginning of the fifteenth century ; otherwise , in the close of the fourteenth century , it was supplanted by the decasyllabic . In the middle of the sixteenth century it again won precedence over the decasyllabic — in part through the influence of Ronsard — and is of course the standard measure of modern French poetry . The name “ alexandrine ” seems to have been applied in the fifteenth century , from the familiar use of the measure in the Alexander romance . The earliest known mention of the term is in Herenc 's Doctrinal de la secunde Retorique . ( See Stengel 's article in Gröber 's Grundriss der Romanischen Philologie , from which these statements are taken . )</p>
   <p>The French alexandrine is in a sense a quite different measure from the English form . Accent is an element of so comparatively slight importance in the French language and French rhythm , that its place seems partly to be filled by regularity of cesural pause and regularity in the counting of syllables . The French alexandrine , therefore , may often be described as a verse of twelve syllables , divided into two equal parts by a pause , with marked accents on the sixth and twelfth syllables , but with the other accents irregularly disposed . Often it seems to an English reader to have an anapestic effect , and to be best described as anapestic tetrameter . In English , however , while the regularity in the number of syllables is followed , and very commonly the medial pause , there is also observed the regularity of alternate accents which gives the verse the characteristic form indicated by the term “ six-stress . ”</p>
   <p>‘ Ye nuten hwat ye biddeþ , þat of gode nabbeþ imone ; for al eure bileve is on stokke oþer on stone : ac þeo , þat god iknoweþ , heo wyten myd iwisse , þat hele is icume to monne of folke judaysse . ’ ‘ Loverd , ’ heo seyde , ‘ nu quiddeþ men , þat cumen is Messyas , þe king , þat wurþ and nuþen is and ever yete was . hwenne he cumeþ , he wyle us alle ryhtleche ; for he nule ne he ne con nenne mon bipeche . ’</p>
   <p>( De Muliere Samaritana , ll . 51-58 . In Morris 's Old English Miscellany , p. 84 ; and Zupitza 's Alt - und Mittelenglisches Übungsbuch , p. 83. ab . 1250 . )</p>
   <p>This early poem illustrates the irregular use of alexandrines near the time of their introduction into English . The poem opens with a septenary —</p>
   <p>“ Tho Iesu Crist an eorthe was , mylde weren his dede ; ”</p>
   <p>and septenaries and alexandrines are used interchangeably . Dr. Triggs says , in his notes on the poem in McLean 's edition of Zupitza 's Übungsbuch , that lines 5 , 6 , 9-18 , 25-28 , 39 , 40 , 43 , 44 , 49-54 , 57 , 58 , 63 , 64 , 66 , 67 , 70-72 , 74 , 75 are alexandrines . ( Introduction , p . lxii . ) The English tendency toward indifference to regularity in the counting of syllables is also noticeable . In the same way the early poem called “ The Passion of our Lord ” ( ed . Morris , E. E. T. S . xlix . 37 ) , which is thought from the heading — “ Ici cumence la passyun ihesu crist en engleys ” — to be a translation from the French , shows a preponderance of alexandrines , although it opens in septenary . See also such poems as the “ Death , ” “ Doomsday , ” etc ., in the Old English Miscellany . The alexandrine was easily confused by the Middle English writers , not only with the septenary , but with the native “ long line , ” and it is often difficult to say just what rhythm was in the writer 's mind . Thus a line like</p>
   <p>“ Be stille , leve soster , thin herte the to-breke , ”</p>
   <p>from the Judas , may be regarded either as an alexandrine or a long four-stress line .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning has made of the alexandrine in this poem an almost new measure , hardly more like the alexandrine couplet of earlier days than the measure of Sordello is like the “ heroic couplet ” proper . In general , the modern use of the alexandrine is characterized by increased freedom in the placing of the cesura . It is also distinguished from the early French and Middle English forms by the fact that the cesura and the ending are commonly masculine .</p>
   <p>By far the most frequent use of the alexandrine in English poetry is as a variant from the five-stress line . For instances of this , see the section on the Spenserian stanza , pp . 102-108 , above , and Corson 's chapters on the Spenserian stanza and its influence , in his Primer of English Verse . In connection with Dryden 's use of the alexandrine as a variant from the heroic couplet , Mr. Saintsbury makes some interesting observations on the measure : “ The metre , though a well-known English critic has maltreated it of late , is a very fine one ; and some of Dryden 's own lines are unmatched examples of that ‘ energy divine ’ which has been attributed to him . In an essay on the alexandrine in English poetry , which yet remains to be written , and which would be not the least valuable of contributions to poetical criticism , this use of the verse would have to be considered , as well as its regular recurrent employment at the close of the Spenserian stanza , and its continuous use .... An examination of the Polyolbion and of Fifine at the Fair , side by side , would , I think , reveal capacities , somewhat unexpected even in this form of arrangement . But so far as the occasional alexandrine is concerned , it is not a hyperbole to say that a number , out of all proportion , of the best lines in English poetry may be found in the closing verses of the Spenserian stave as used by Spenser himself , by Shelley , and by the present Laureate , and in the occasional alexandrines of Dryden . The only thing to be said against this latter use is , that it demands a very skilful ear and hand to adjust the cadence . ” ( Life of Dryden , in Men of Letters Series , pp . 172 , 173 . )</p>

    <head>B .— THE SEPTENARY</head>
    <head>The septenary , or seven-stress verse ( sometimes called the septenarius , from the Latin form of the word ) was a familiar measure of mediæval Latin poetry . There it was more commonly trochaic than iambic , as in the famous drinking song of the Goliards :</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Meum est propositum in taberna mori :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In English , naturally enough , the measure always tended to be iambic . In both Latin and English there was considerable freedom as to the number of light syllables . It will be noticed that in the specimens just quoted from the Latin there is rime not only between the ends of the verses but between the syllables just preceding the cesura . Where this was the case there was a tendency toward the breaking up of the verse into a quatrain of verses in four and three stresses , riming abab ; such septenaries , indeed , were written at pleasure either in couplets or quatrains . We shall see the same phenomena in the English forms of the measure . But the seven-stress rhythm is not easily lost or mistaken , in whatever form it appears , and has a certain charm which at one time appealed very widely to metrical taste .</p>
   <p>The earliest appearance of the septenary in English is in the Poema Morale , dated about 1170 by Zupitza , by others somewhat later . For a specimen of this , see p. 127 , above . Here there is only end-rime , and the individuality of the long line is well preserved . There is some freedom , however , as to the number of light syllables , and some variation between the iambic and trochaic rhythm .</p>

Orm 's septenaries are also the most regular of the Middle English period , preserving an almost painful accuracy throughout the 20 , 000 extant lines of the poem . In general the measure appears in this period in combination with alexandrines and other measures , and with much irregularity . Like the alexandrine , it was sometimes confused with the long four-stress line . In the well-known poem called “ A Little Soth Sermun ” the first line is an unquestionable septenary ( “ Herkneth alle gode men and stylle sitteth a-dun ” ) , but presently we find verse of six stresses , and even short four-stress couplets .</p>

   <p>These specimens show the ballad stanza , which is made of a sort of septenary resolved into short lines of four and three accents . It is often assumed that the measure was derived from the Latin septenary ; but owing to the difficulty of supposing that a foreign metre should have been adopted for the most popular of all forms of poetry , some scholars prefer to think that the ballad stanza of this form is the same as that in which all lines have four accents ( see specimen on p. 157 , above ) , the last accent of the second and fourth lines having dropped off by natural processes . On the ballad stanzas in general , see Gummere 's English Ballads , Appendix II . p. 303 . Compare with the present specimens the metre of Cowper 's John Gilpin .</p>

   <p>C .— THE “ POULTER 'S MEASURE . ”</p>
   <p>In the Elizabethan age the alexandrine and the septenary were each used chiefly in conjunction with the other , in alternation of six-stress and seven-stress verses . The name commonly applied to the combination is taken from Gascoigne 's Notes of Instruction ( 1575 ) , where he says : “ The commonest sort of verse which we use now adayes ( viz . the long verse of twelve and fourtene sillables ) I know not certainly howe to name it , unlesse I should say that it doth consist of Poulters measure , which giveth xii . for one dozen and xiiii . for another . ” ( Arber 's Reprint , p . 39 . ) It strikes the reader with surprise to find the measure thus spoken of as “ the commonest sort of verse , ” but a glance at any of the early Elizabethan anthologies will show the justness of Gascoigne 's words . Yet the measure , while exceedingly popular , seems to have been instinctively avoided by the best poets ( after the days of Surrey and Sidney ) ; hence it is unfamiliar to modern readers .</p>
   <p>The use of alexandrines and septenaries together , we have seen , was common even in the Middle English period , but not in regular alternation . The Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester ( about 1300 ) mingles both measures , but with alexandrines predominating . In some of the early Mystery Plays they are found in alternation ; for example , where Jacob , in one of the Towneley plays , is relating his hunger to Esau :</p>

   <p>Schipper says that he does not know who first brought the two measures together in alternate use for lyrical poetry . Guest says that the Poulter 's Measure came into fashion soon after 1500 ( History of English Rhythms ) , but gives no examples so early . The history of the measure should be further investigated .</p>
   <p>After the Elizabethan period the Poulter 's Measure practically disappears from English poetry . A curious suggestion of it may be found in a little poem of Leigh Hunt 's ( Wealth and Womanhood ) , cited by Schipper , who calls the verse “ Poulter 's Measure in trochaics ":</p>

   <p>IV . THE SONNET</p>
   <p>The sonnet is an Italian verse-form , in fourteen five-stress lines , introduced into England at the time of the Italian literary influences of the sixteenth century . Almost from the first , the English sonnet has been divided into two classes : one based on more or less strict imitation of the structure of the Italian form , and variously called the Italian , the regular , or the legitimate sonnet ; the other taking the Italian sonnet as the point of departure , but constructed according to more familiar English rime-schemes , and commonly called the Shaksperian or the English sonnet .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The origin of the sonnet in southern Europe is a matter of some</l>
     <l n="2">disagreement . Some scholars trace it to the canzone strophe ( e. g .</l>
     <l n="3">Gaspary , in his Geschichte der Italienischen Literatur ) , others to the</l>
     <l n="4">combination of the ottava rima with a six-line stanza ( Welti , in his</l>
     <l n="5">Geschichte des Sonettes in der deutschen Dichtung ) , others to</l>
     <l n="6">Provençal and even German influence . ( See Schipper , vol . ii . pp . 835</l>
     <l n="7">ff ., and Lentzner 's Das Sonett und seine Gestaltung in der englischen</l>
     <l n="8">Dichtung , p . 1 . ) It seems first to have been a recognized form in Italy</l>
     <l n="9">in the latter part of the thirteenth century ( see Tomlinson 's The</l>
     <l n="10">Sonnet : its Origin , Structure , and Place in Poetry ) ; and was made</l>
     <l n="11">glorious by Dante , Michael Angelo , Tasso , Ariosto , and — above</l>
     <l n="12">all — Petrarch . On the different forms of the Italian sonnet , see</l>
     <l n="13">Tomlinson 's essay , just cited .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The object of the regular or legitimate Italian sonnet , ” says Mr. Tomlinson , “ is to express one , and only one , idea , mood , sentiment , or proposition , and this must be introduced ... in the first quatrain , and so far explained in the second , that this may end in a full point ; while the office of the first tercet is to prepare the leading idea of the quatrains for the conclusion , which conclusion is to be perfectly carried out in the second tercet , so that it may contain the fundamental idea of the poem . ” ( pp . 27 , 28 . )</p>
   <p>The Italian form is always marked by the division into octave and sestet , although English usage has been very irregular in marking this division by a full pause . The octave is based on only two rimes ( abbaabba ) ; the sestet on either two or three , the most common arrangements being cdecde , cdcdcd , cdedce , and cddcee .</p>
   <p>With regard to the pause at the point of division Lentzner says : “ It should not be a full pause , because this would produce the effect of a gap or breaking-off , ...— not like the speaker who has reached the end of what he has to say , but like one who reflects on what has already been said , and then takes fresh breath to complete his theme . "[ 35 ]</p>
   <p>Most critics prefer those forms of sestet which avoid a final riming couplet . This Mr. Courthope explains as follows : “ The reason for the avoidance of the couplet in the second portion of the sonnet is , I think , plain . In the first eight lines the thought ascends to a climax ; this part of the sonnet may be said to contain the premises of the poetical syllogism . In the last six lines the idea descends to a conclusion , and as the two divisions are of unequal length it is necessary that the lesser should be the more individualised . Hence while , in the first part , the expression of the thought is massed and condensed by reduplications of sound , and the general movement is limited by quatrains ; in the second part the clauses are separated by the alternation of the rhymes , the movement is measured by tercets , and the whole weight of the rhetorical emphasis is thrown into the last line . ” ( History of English Poetry , vol . ii . p . 91 . )</p>
   <p>The sonnet has remained , since its introduction into English poetry , a favorite form among poets and critics , but has never become genuinely popular . It is suited , of course , only for the expression of dignified and careful thinking ; and the difficulty of giving it unity and confining the content to the precise limit of fourteen lines has made perfect success in the form a rare attainment . Furthermore , the complexity of the rime-scheme — the distance at which one rime responds to another — makes the appreciation of the form a matter of some delicacy , less suited to the prevailingly simple taste of the English ear than to the more complex taste of the Italian .</p>
   <p>The following specimens are classified only in the two principal groups of the Italian and the English form . The common test of the Italian form is that the rime-scheme shall separate the first eight lines from the rest , these eight lines ordinarily showing “ inclusive rime ” of the abba type ; the test of the English form is that the rime-scheme shall separate the first twelve lines from the last two , the twelve lines ordinarily showing alternate rime .</p>
   <p>Schipper groups English sonnets in five classes : ( 1 ) the strict Italian form , with pause between octave and sestet ; ( 2 ) the Surrey-Shakspere or English form ; ( 3 ) the Spenserian form ; ( 4 ) the Miltonic form , with correct rime-arrangement but general neglect of the bipartite structure ; ( 5 ) the modern Italian or Wordsworthian form , following the regular rime-scheme in general , but often with a third or even a fourth rime in the octave , and treated as a single strophe .

   <p>It was Wyatt who introduced the sonnet into England . Thirty-one of his sonnets were published in Tottel 's Miscellany , of which about a third are said to be translations or paraphrases of Petrarch 's . Wyatt followed , of course , the regular Italian structure , but used unhesitatingly the form of sestet with the concluding couplet ( cddcee ) . On this point Mr. Courthope says : “ Wyatt was evidently unaware of the secret principle underlying the extremely complex structure of the Italian sonnet ; ... and being unfortunately misled by his admiration for the Strambotti of Serafino , which sum up the conclusion in a couplet , he endeavored to construct his sonnets on the same principle , thereby leading all sonnet writers before Milton on a wrong path . ” ( History of English Poetry , vol . ii . p . 91 . )</p>

   <p>Sidney 's favorite form for the sonnet sestet was that shown in these specimens ( cdcdee ) , a form that suggests the influence of the Surrey or English sonnet rather than the Italian . The first of the sonnets is of course exceptional in being written in alexandrines , but is among the finest in the sequence . See also Sidney 's sonnet of the English type , p. 291 , below .</p>
   <p>The Astrophel and Stella ( containing 110 sonnets ) is the earliest of the great sonnet-sequences or sonnet-cycles of English poetry , those of Spenser , Shakspere , Rossetti , and Mrs. Browning being later representatives . In the Elizabethan age the fashion of writing sonnets , and sonnet-sequences in particular , was at its height , especially in the last decade of the century ( 1590-1600 ) . On this subject , see the Introduction to Professor Schelling 's Elizabethan Lyrics , in the Athenæum Press Series , and Mr. Sidney Lee 's Life of Shakspere . Other noteworthy sonnet-sequences besides those of Sidney , Spenser , and Shakspere were Constable 's Diana , Daniel 's Delia , Lodge 's Phyllis , Watson 's Tears of Fancy , Barnes 's Parthenophil , Giles Fletcher 's Lycia , and Drayton 's Idea ,— all published in the years 1592-1594 . A now forgotten poet by the name of Lok produced more than four hundred sonnets , proving himself an Elizabethan rival to Wordsworth .</p>

   <p>Wordsworth 's complaint as to the number of Milton 's sonnets ( “ alas , too few ! ” ) certainly cannot be applied to his own . They number about five hundred , ranking him as the most prolific English sonneteer . These include some of the finest sonnets in the language , and very many of admittedly indifferent quality . Mr. Swinburne regards his sonnets as on the whole “ the best out of sight ” in our poetry . In general he followed the Italian model , but with very great liberty . He not only practised great variety of rime-arrangement in the sestet , but frequently altered the scheme of the octave to such forms as abbaacca ; see , for example , the specimen beginning “ Scorn not the Sonnet . ” Wordsworth also showed no regard for the careful division of thought between octave and sestet . Indeed in a letter to Dyce , in 1833 , he said that he regarded the sonnet not as a piece of architecture , but as “ an orbicular body ,— a sphere or a dew-drop . ” ( Works , ed . Knight , vol . xi . p . 232 . ) Its excellence seemed to him to consist mainly in a “ pervading sense of intense unity . ” Nevertheless , he admitted that “ a sonnet will often be found excellent , where the beginning , the middle , and the end are distinctly marked , and also where it is distinctly separated into two parts , to which , as I before observed , the strict Italian model , as they write it , is favorable . ”</p>

   <p>It is curious that the two chief representatives of English poetry of the Victorian period , Tennyson and Browning , should neither of them have given much attention to the sonnet nor have achieved any notable success in the form . Among Tennyson 's poems there are some seventeen sonnets , of which the present specimen was considered by the poet to be the best . It represents a common form of the bipartite structure , where the octave is a narrative , and the sestet a comment upon what has been narrated . In the following specimen , from Matthew Arnold , the structure is similar . Lentzner quotes the East London , in his monograph on the English sonnet , as a case where the octave represents the thought in particular , the sestet in the abstract ; in other cases the order is the reverse .</p>

   <p>Surrey experimented with the Italian sonnet as it had been introduced into England by his master Wyatt , but soon devised a variation from the Italian form , and wrote a majority of his sonnets in the new English form ( nine out of the sixteen which are printed in Tottel 's Miscellany ) . This new form is divided , not into octave and sestet , but into three quatrains , with alternate rime , and a couplet . It produces , therefore , an effect quite different from that of the legitimate Italian sonnet , the couplet at the end giving it a more epigrammatic structure . Surrey 's form seems more consonant with common English taste for simplicity of rime-structure , and , besides being honored by its adoption by Shakspere , has remained a favorite side by side with the more “ correct ” original .<span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span></p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>In 1575 , when Gascoigne wrote his Notes of Instruction , he found it necessary to say : “ Some thinke that all Poemes ( being short ) may be called Sonets , as in deede it is a diminutive worde derived of Sonare , but yet I can beste allowe to call those Sonnets whiche are of fouretene lynes , every line conteyning tenne syllables . The firste twelve do ryme in staves of foure lines by crosse meetre , and the last two ryming togither do conclude the whole . ” ( Arber 's Reprint , pp . 38 , 39 . ) It is , of course , the English sonnet which Gascoigne thus describes .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>Shakspere also introduced sonnets into some of his earlier plays : Love 's Labor 's Lost , All 's Well that Ends Well , Romeo and Juliet , and Henry V. See Fleay 's Chronicle of the English Drama , vol . ii . p. 224 , and Schelling 's Elizabethan Lyrics , p. xxx .</p>
   <p>V. THE ODE</p>
   <p>The term Ode is used of English poetry with considerable vagueness . The Century Dictionary defines the word thus : “ A lyric poem expressive of exalted or enthusiastic emotion , especially one of complex or irregular metrical form ; originally and strictly , such a composition intended to be sung . ” Compare with this the definition of Mr. Gosse , in his collection of English Odes : “ Any strain of enthusiastic and exalted lyrical verse , directed to a fixed purpose , and dealing progressively with one dignified theme . ”</p>
   <p>Viewed from the purely metrical standpoint , English odes are commonly either ( a ) regular Pindaric odes , imitative of the structure of the Greek ode , or ( b ) irregular , so-called “ Pindaric ” or “ Cowleyan ” odes . A third group may be made of forms based on the imitation of the choral odes of the Greek drama . There is also a class of odes called “ Horatian , ” made up of simple lyrical stanzas ; the name “ ode ” is applied here only because of the content of the poem or because of resemblance to the so-called odes ( properly carmina or songs ) of Horace , and since these Horatian odes show no metrical peculiarities they will not be represented here .<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span></p>
   <p>The characteristic effect of the ode is produced by the varying lengths of lines employed , and the varying distances at which the rimes answer one another . This variety , in the hands of a master of verse , is capable of splendid effectiveness , but it gives dangerous license to the unskilled writer .</p>

     <l n="36">( BEN JONSON : A Pindaric Ode on the death of Sir H. Morison . 1629 . )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This ode of Jonson 's is apparently the earliest , and remained for a long time the only , notable English ode based on the strict structure of the Greek original . The Greek ode was commonly divided into the strophe , the antistrophe , and the epode ; the strophe and antistrophe being identical in structure , though varying in different odes , and the epode being of different structure . Jonson therefore followed the classical form carefully , and introduced English terms to express the original three divisions .</p>
   <p>Professor Bronson observes , in his Introduction to the Odes of Collins : “ It is a commonplace that the Pindaric Ode in English is an artificial exotic , of slight native force , and unable to reproduce the effects of the Greek original . The reason is obvious . The Greek odes were accompanied by music and dancing , the singers moving to one side during the strophe , retracing their steps during the antistrophe , ... and standing still during the epode . The ear was thus helped by the eye , and the divisions of the ode were distinct and significant . But in an English Pindaric the elaborate correspondences and differences between strophe , antistrophe , and epode are lost upon most readers , and even the critical reader derives from them a pleasure intellectual rather than sensuous . ” ( Edition of Collins , Athenæum Press Series , Introduction , pp . lxxiv , lxxv . )</p>

     <l n="16">Arms . 1706 . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">To Congreve is due the credit for the revival of the regular ode in the</l>
     <l n="18">eighteenth century , after it had been long forgotten by English poets .</l>
     <l n="19">Meantime the irregular form , devised by Cowley , had become popular ; and</l>
     <l n="20">against the license of this Congreve protested in his Discourse on the</l>
     <l n="21">Pindaric Ode , prefixed to his Ode of 1706 . ( See Mr. Gosse 's</l>
     <l n="22">Introduction to English Odes , p . xvii ., and his Life of Congreve , p .</l>
     <l n="23">158 . )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Congreve said in his Discourse : “ The following ode is an attempt towards restoring the regularity of the ancient lyric poetry , which seems to be altogether forgotten , or unknown , by our English writers . There is nothing more frequent among us than a sort of poems entitled Pindaric Odes , pretending to be written in imitation of the manner and style of Pindar , and yet I do not know that there is to this day extant , in our language , one ode contrived after his model .... The character of these late Pindarics is a bundle of rambling incoherent thoughts , expressed in a like parcel of irregular stanzas , which also consist of such another complication of disproportioned , uncertain , and perplexed verses and rhymes .... On the contrary , there is nothing more regular than the odes of Pindar , both as to the exact observation of the measures and numbers of his stanzas and verses , and the perpetual coherence of his thoughts ....</p>
   <p>“ Though there be no necessity that our triumphal odes should consist of the three afore-mentioned stanzas , yet if the reader can observe that the great variation of the numbers in the third stanza ( call it epode , or what you please ) has a pleasing effect in the ode , and makes him return to the first and second stanzas with more appetite than he could do if always cloyed with the same quantities and measures , I cannot see why some use may not be made of Pindar 's example , to the great improvement of the English ode . There is certainly a pleasure in beholding anything that has art and difficulty in the contrivance , especially if it appears so carefully executed that the difficulty does not show itself till it is sought for ....</p>
   <p>“ Having mentioned Mr. Cowley , it may very well be expected that something should be said of him , at a time when the imitation of Pindar is the theme of our discourse . But there is that great deference due to the memory , great parts , and learning , of that gentleman , that I think nothing should be objected to the latitude he has taken in his Pindaric odes . The beauty of his verses is an atonement for the irregularity of his stanzas .... Yet I must beg leave to add that I believe those irregular odes of Mr. Cowley may have been the principal , though innocent , occasion of so many deformed poems since , which , instead of being true pictures of Pindar , have ( to use the Italian painters ’ term ) been only caricatures of him . ”</p>

     <l n="51">( COLLINS : Ode to Liberty , strophe and antistrophe . 1746 . )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This ode consists of strophe , epode , antistrophe , and second epode . The antistrophe corresponds metrically to the strophe , as usual ; the epodes are in four-stress couplets . It was Collins 's habit to place the epode between the strophe and antistrophe , perhaps , as Professor Bronson suggests , in order that it may produce “ an impression of its own analogous to that of the Greek epode , namely , an impression of relief and repose . ” Mr. Bronson says further of Collins 's odes : “ Collins was less scholarly than Gray , but he was bolder and more original ; and consciously or unconsciously he so constructed his odes that their organic parts stand out clearly distinct and produce effects analogous to those produced by the Greek ode . In brief , his method was , first , to make large divisions of the thought correspond to the large divisions of the form ; and , second , to throw out into relief the complex strophe and antistrophe by contrasting them with a simple epode . The reader may not perceive the minute correspondences in form between strophe and antistrophe , but he can hardly fail to feel that the two answer to one another in a general way . ” ( Athenæum Press edition of Collins , Introduction , p . lxxv . )</p>

     <l n="38">( COWLEY : The Resurrection , strophes iii . and iv . 1656 ) .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Cowley , as has already appeared , introduced the irregular ode into English poetry , calling it “ Pindaric ” under a misapprehension of the real structure of the Greek odes . He published fifteen “ Pindarique Odes ” in 1656 ( see the Preface to these , in Grosart 's edition of his works , vol . ii . p. 4 ) . The present specimen illustrates the really not unskilful use which Cowley made of the varying cadences of the form , and also sets forth — in the amusing concluding lines — his own idea of its difficulties .</p>
   <p>Under the influence of Cowley 's odes , the new form speedily became popular . According to Dr. Johnson , “ this lax and lawless versification so much concealed the deficiencies of the barren , and flattered the laziness of the idle , that it immediately over-spread our books of poetry ; all the boys and girls caught the pleasing fashion , and they who could do nothing else could write like Pindar . ” ( Life of Cowley . ) Compare also the remarks of Mr. Gosse : “ Until the days of Collins and Gray , the ode modelled upon Cowley was not only the universal medium for congratulatory lyrics and pompous occasional pieces , but it was almost the only variety permitted to the melancholy generations over whom the heroic couplet reigned supreme . ” ( Seventeenth Century Studies , p . 216 . )</p>
   <p>It has been the habit of modern critics to treat the irregularities of the Cowleyan ode with no little contempt , and it is undoubtedly true that in the hands of small poets its liberties are dangerous ; but it is also true that some of the greatest modern poets have adopted the form for some of their best work , and that they have generally preferred it to that of the regular Pindaric ode .</p>

   <p>Dryden 's odes for St. Cecilia 's Day ( especially the Alexander 's Feast ) are among the most highly esteemed of his poems ; but parts , at least , of the ode on Mistress Killigrew are no less fine , and in this case we have a purely literary ode , whose irregularities are not designed — as in the case of the others — to fit choral rendering . The conclusion of the ode , here quoted , seems to owe something of both substance and form to the conclusion of Cowley 's Resurrection Ode ( see preceding specimen ) . Dr. Johnson called Dryden 's Killigrew Ode “ undoubtedly the noblest ode that our language ever has produced . ”</p>

   <p>In this poem the English ode may be said to have reached its high-water mark . Professor Corson observes : “ The several metres are felt , in the course of the reading of the Ode , to be organic — inseparable from what each is employed to express . The rhymes , too , with their varying degrees of emphasis , according to the nearness or remoteness , and the length , of the rhyming verses , are equally a part of the expression .... The feelings of the reader of English poetry get to be set , so to speak , to the pentameter measure , as in that measure the largest portion of English poetry is written ; and , accordingly , other measures derive some effect from that fact . In the theme-metre , generally , the more reflective portions of the Ode , its deeper tones , are expressed . The gladder notes come in the shorter metres .... Wordsworth never wrote any poem of which it can be more truly said than of his great Ode , ‘ Of the soul the body form doth take . ’ ” ( Primer of English Verse , pp . 32-34 . )</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Mr. Patmore 's use of the irregular ode forms is of particular interest . He made a special study of the form , and applied it more widely than is commonly done . His first odes were printed ( not published ) in 1868 , and from one of these the present specimen is taken . Later ( 1877 ) , in connection with The Unknown Eros , he set forth his view of the ode form , treating it not as lawless but as governed by laws of its own . “ Nearly all English metres , ” he said , “ owe their existence as metres to ‘ catalexis , ’ or pause , for the time of one or more feet , and , as a rule , the position and amount of catalexis , are fixed . But the verse in which this volume is written is catalectic par excellence , employing the pause ( as it does the rhyme ) with freedom only limited by the exigencies of poetic passion . From the time of Drummond of Hawthornden to our own , some of the noblest flights of English poetry have been taken on the wings of this verse ; but with ordinary readers it has been more or less discredited by the far greater number of abortive efforts , on the part sometimes of considerable poets , to adapt it to purposes with which it has no expressional correspondence ; or to vary it by rhythmical movements which are destructive of its character . Some persons , unlearned in the subject of this metre , have objected to this kind of verse that it is ‘ lawless . ’ But it has its laws as truly as any other . In its highest order , the lyric or ‘ ode , ’ it is a tetrameter , the line having the time of eight iambics . When it descends to narrative , or the expression of a less exalted strain of thought , it becomes a trimeter , having the time of six iambics , or even a dimeter , with the time of four ; and it is allowable to vary the tetrameter ‘ ode ’ by the occasional introduction of passages in either or both of these inferior measures , but not , I think , by the use of any other . The license to rhyme at indefinite intervals is counterbalanced ... by unusual frequency in the recurrence of the same rhyme . ” ( From Patmore 's Prefatory Note to The Unknown Eros ; quoted by William Sharp , in the Introduction to Great Odes , p . xxxii . )[ 40 ]</p>

Even Milton could not ; though with his godlike instinct and his godlike might of hand he made a kind of strange and enormous harmony by intermixture of assonance and rhyme with irregular blank verse , as in that last Titanic chorus of Samson which utters over the fallen Philistines the trumpet-blast and thunder of its triumphs . ” ( Essays and Studies , pp . 162 , 163 . )</p>

   <p>While English verse is generally admitted to be based on a different system from that of Greek and Latin poetry ( the element of accent obscuring that of quantity in English prosody , as the element of quantity obscures that of accent in classical prosody ) , there have been repeated attempts to introduce the more familiar classical measures into English . Most of these attempts have been academic and have attracted the attention only of critics and scholars ; a few have interested the reading public .</p>
   <p>Imitations of classical verse in English may conveniently be divided into two classes : imitations of lyrical measures , and imitations of the dactylic hexameter . The latter group is of course much the larger , especially in modern poetry . It will appear that the classical measures might also be divided into two groups according to another distinction : those attempting to observe the quantitative prosody of the original language , and those in which the original measure is transmuted into frankly accentual verse .</p>
   <p>The original impulse toward this classical or pseudo-classical verse was a product of the Renaissance , when all forms of art not based on Greek and Latin models were suspected . Rime , not being found in the poetry of the classical languages , was treated as a product of the dark ages ,— the invention of “ Goths and Huns . ” See Roger Ascham 's Schoolmaster ( 1570 ) for the most characteristic representative of this phase of thought in England . The new forms of verse were , naturally enough , first tried in Italy . Schipper traces the beginning of the movement to Alberti ( 1404-1484 ) . A century later Trissino wrote his Sophonisbe and Italia Liberata in unrimed verse , in professed imitation of Homer , and was looked upon as the inventor of versi sciolti , that is , verses “ freed ” from rime ( compare the remarks of Milton in the prefatory note to Paradise Lost ) . In 1539 Claudio Tolomei wrote Versi e Regole della Poesia Nuova , a systematic attempt to introduce the classical versification . He also wrote hexameters and sapphics . In France there were similar efforts in the sixteenth century . Mousset translated Homer into hexameters in 1530 , and A. de Baïf , a member of the “ Pleiade ” ( 1532-1589 ) , devised some French hexameters which he called vers baïfins . The English experiments were worked out independently , and yet under the same neo-classical influences . On this subject , see Schipper , vol . ii . pp . 2-12 , 439-464 .</p>

   <p>Sidney was a member of the little group of classical students who called themselves the “ Areopagus , ” and who were interested in introducing classical measures into English verse . Others of the group were Gabriel Harvey and Edmund Spenser , from whose correspondence most of our information regarding the movement is derived . ( See the letters in Grosart 's edition of Harvey 's Works , vol . i. pp . 7-9 , 20-24 , 35-37 , 75-76 , 99-107 . ) Spenser 's only known efforts in the same direction are also preserved in this correspondence ; a poem in twenty-one iambic trimeters , and this “ tetrasticon ":—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ See yee the blindfoulded pretie god , that feathered archer ,</l>
     <l n="2">Of lovers miseries which maketh his bloodie game ?</l>
     <l n="3">Wote ye why his moother with a veale hath coovered his face ?</l>
     <l n="4">Trust me , least he my loove happely chaunce to beholde . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It would seem that Spenser was attempting , more conscientiously than Sidney did , to follow the classical rules of quantity in making his verses ; hence they are more difficult to read according to English rhythm . Sidney 's experiments in the classical versification are perhaps the most successful , to modern taste , of all those made in the Elizabethan period . Among the other songs in the Arcadia will be found sapphics and hexameters .</p>
   <p>See especially Spenser 's letter of April , 1580 , and Harvey 's reply ( op . cit ., vol . i. pp . 35 , 99 ) , for notable passages indicating the seriousness with which the members of the “ Areopagus ” were trying to orm English verse so as to bring it under the rules of classical prosody . The relations of quantity and accent were not understood , as indeed they may be said still not to be understood for the English language . Spenser suggests , in a frequently quoted passage , that in the word carpenter the middle syllable is “ short in speech , when it shall be read long in verse , ” — that is , because the vowel is followed by two consonants ; hence it “ seemeth like a lame gosling that draweth one legge after her .... But it is to be wonne with custome , and rough words must be subdued with use . ” Harvey resented the idea that the common pronunciation of words could be departed from in order to conform them to arbitrary metrical rules , and in his reply said : “ You shall never have my subscription or consent ... to make your Carp [= e ] nter our Carp [) e ] nter , an inche longer or bigger , than God and his Englishe people have made him .... Else never heard I any that durst presume so much over the Englishe ... as to alter the quantitie of any one sillable , otherwise than oure common speache and generall receyved custome woulde beare them oute . ” But while all English verse must be consistent with “ the vulgare and naturall mother prosodye , ” Harvey does not despair of finding a system that shall be at the same time “ countervaileable to the best tongues ” in making possible quantitative verse . The whole passage is well worth reading . The best account of the movement toward classical versification in the days of the “ Areopagus ” will be found in Professor Schelling 's Poetic and Verse Criticism in the Reign of Elizabeth ( Publications of the University of Pennsylvania ) .</p>

   <p>The full title of Campion 's work was : “ Observations in the Art of English Poesie ; wherein it is demonstratively proved , and by example confirmed , that the English toong will receive eight severall kinds of numbers , proper to it selfe , which are all in this booke set forth , and were never before this time by any man attempted . ” Campion , like other classical versifiers , condemned rime as a barbarity ; but in imitating the classical measures he does not violate the normal English accent , so that his verses read smoothly in English rhythm . Curiously enough , he includes among his innovations an iambic measure which proves to be ordinary decasyllabic verse :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Goe numbers boldly passe , stay not for ayde</l>
     <l n="2">Of shifting rime , that easie flatterer ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whose witchcraft can the ruder eares beguile ” .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Professor Schelling exclaims : “ Where could the musical Doctor have kept his ears all this time ? to propose this measure thus innocently for the drama , when the English stage had been ringing with his ‘ licentiate iambics ’ for more than two decades ! ”</p>
   <p>The second of the specimens quoted above Campion describes as a dimeter “ whose first foote may either be a Sponde or Trochy : the two verses following are both of them Trochaical , and consist of foure feete , the first of either of them being a Spondee or Trochy , the other three only Trochyes . The fourth and last verse is made of two Trochyes . The number is voluble and fit to expresse any amorous conceit . ” ( See also another of Campion 's measures , in Part One , p . 27 . )[ 43 ]</p>
   <p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries few , if any , notable English poems were written in the classical measures . Goldsmith , in one of his essays ( xviii , on Versification ) , maintained the possibility of reducing English words to the classical prosody , and said : “ We have seen several late specimens of English hexameters and sapphics so happily composed that , by attaching them to the idea of ancient measure , we found them in all respects as melodious and agreeable to the ear as the works of Virgil and Anacreon , or Horace . ” But whose these were it seems to be impossible to say .</p>

   <p>Tennyson took no little interest in the relations of classical and English metres , and seems to have believed in the possibility of genuine English quantitative verse . He did not , however , regard it as of practical value , and treated his own experiments as trifles . In his Memoirs , written by his son , Tennyson is said to have observed that he knew the quantity of every English word except scissors , a mysterious saying which may be set beside Southey 's declaration that Egypt is the only spondee in the English language . His son also preserves an extemporaneous line composed by Tennyson to illustrate the observance of quantity “ regardless of accent ":</p>

   <p>Mr. Ellis 's translations from Catullus are all “ in the metres of the original , ” and are among the most interesting specimens of modern classical versifying . “ Tennyson 's Alcaics and Hendecasyllabics , ” he said in his Preface , “ suggested to me the new principle on which I was to go to work . It was not sufficient to reproduce the ancient metres , unless the ancient quantity was reproduced also . ” Of special interest is the imitation of the “ almost unapproachable ” galliambic verse of the Attis ( pp . 49-53 ):</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ When awoke the sun , the golden , that his eyes heaven-orient</l>

   <p>Sidney was evidently trying to write genuinely quantitative hexameters . Thus “ of love , ” in the third line , may be regarded as a quantitative spondee ( the o being followed by two consonants ) , although the of would not naturally be stressed . In like manner it is very possible that “ pallace ” was spelled with two l 's in order to make the first syllable seem long .</p>
   <p>Sidney 's hexameters are the first in literary verse which have come down to us ; but there must have been earlier efforts at least by the time of Ascham 's Schoolmaster ( 1570 ) , which vigorously attacked “ our rude beggerly ryming , brought first into Italie by Gothes and Hunnes , ... and at last receyved into England by men of excellent wit in deede , but of small learning , and less judgement in that behalfe . ” ( Arber Reprint , p . 145 . ) One hexameter distich by a contemporary and friend of Ascham 's , Master Watson of Cambridge , is handed down to us by Webbe , as being “ common in the mouthes of all men ":</p>

   <p>Stanyhurst 's Vergil is one of the curiosities of Elizabethan literature , not only from its verse-form but from its spelling and diction . The translator declares himself a disciple of Ascham , in his antipathy to rimed verse ; “ What Tom Towly is so simple , ” he asks , “ that wyl not attempt too bee a rithmoure ? ” In an address to the Learned Reader he explains his system of English quantitative prosody . In 1593 Stanyhurst 's hexameters were severely noticed in a passage by Thomas Nash directed primarily against the classical versifying of Gabriel Harvey . “ The hexamiter verse , ” said Nash , “ I graunt to be a gentleman of an auncient house ( so is many an English begger ) , yet this clyme of ours he cannot thrive in ; our speech is too craggy for him to set his plough in ; hee goes twitching and hopping in our language , like a man running upon quagmiers , up the hill in one syllable and down the dale in another , retaining no part of that stately smooth gate which he vaunts himselfe with among the Greeks and Latins .... Master Stannyhurst ( though otherwise learned ) trod a foule lumbring boystrous wallowing measure , in his translation of Virgil . ” ( Works of Nash , Grosart edition , vol . ii . pp . 237 , 238 . )</p>

   <p>When English hexameters were revived at the end of the eighteenth century , it was in good part under German influence . Bodmer , Klopstock , and Voss , followed later by Goethe , made the German hexameter popular ; and William Taylor of Norwich , who in many ways helped to familiarize his countrymen with German literature , became interested in the form . In 1796 , the year of Goethe 's Hermann und Dorothea , he contributed to the Monthly Magazine an article called “ English Hexameters Exemplified , ” in which occurred the paraphrase from Ossian here quoted . Taylor pointed out that the hexameter of the Germans was purely accentual . They were “ obliged , by the scarceness of long vowels and the rifeness of short syllables in their language , to tolerate the frequent substitution of trochees for spondees in their hexameter verse ; and they scan , like other modern nations , by emphasis , not by position . ” ( Quoted in J. W. Robberds 's Memoir of William Taylor of Norwich , vol . i. pp . 157 ff . ) Most later writers of English hexameters have followed the line here indicated , and have frankly abandoned the effort to represent the quantities of classical prosody .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Evangeline is undoubtedly the most popular and widely read poem in English hexameters , and may be said to have revived the vogue of the measure in the middle of the nineteenth century . Yet its metrical qualities have not pleased most careful critics . Matthew Arnold said that the reception which the poem met with indicated that the dislike for the metre “ is rather among professional critics than among the general public . Yet , ” he went on to say , “ a version of Homer in hexameters of the Evangeline type would not satisfy the judicious , nor is the definite establishment of this type to be desired . ” ( On Translating Homer , Macmillan ed ., p . 284 . ) Mr. Arnold had previously suggested that the “ lumbering effect ” of such hexameters as Longfellow 's is “ caused by their being much too dactylic ” ; more spondees should be introduced .</p>
   <p>The editor of the Riverside edition of Evangeline remarks interestingly : “ The measure lends itself easily to the lingering melancholy which marks the greater part of the poem . The fall of the verse at the end of the line and the sharp recovery at the beginning of the next will be snares to the reader , who must beware of a jerking style of delivery .... A little practice will enable one to acquire that habit of reading the hexameter which we may liken , roughly , to the climbing of a hill , resting a moment on the summit , and then descending the other side . ”</p>
   <p>Longfellow 's hexameters were criticised most severely by his countryman , Edgar Poe . Poe denied the possibility of any adequate representation of the classical hexameter in English , largely because of the impossibility of using English spondees . The only genuine hexameters he knew , he declared , were some he had himself made , running :</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Clough 's hexameters are quite unlike any others in English poetry , both in their metrical quality and in their use for serio-comic verse . As Matthew Arnold observed , they are “ excessively , needlessly rough , ” but their free , garrulous effect has a charm of its own . Clough also wrote some hexameters intended to be strictly quantitative . ( For a detailed criticism of the verse of the Bothie , see Robert Bridges 's Milton 's Prosody , 1901 ed ., Appendix J . )</p>
   <p>It was Clough 's hexameters , together with some “ English Hexameter Translations ” by Dr. Hawtrey and Mr. Lockhart ( 1847 ) , that chiefly encouraged Matthew Arnold to believe that the measure might be well adapted to a translation of Homer . “ The hexameter , whether alone or with the pentameter , possesses a movement , an expression , which no metre hitherto in common use amongst us possesses , and which I am convinced English poetry , as our mental wants multiply , will not always be content to forego . ” ( Ib ., p . 210 . ) Mr. James Spedding replied to Mr. Arnold 's suggestion , from the point of view of the classical scholar , urging that only hexameters purely quantitative could properly represent those of Vergil . He illustrated his views by an amusing “ hexametrical dialogue , ” conducted alternately in Vergilian measure and “ in that of Longfellow . ” Of the former are the lines :</p>

   <p>Arnold , however , wisely declined to be led into a discussion of the relations of accent and quantity in English . “ All we are here concerned with , ” he said , “ is the imitation , by the English hexameter , of the ancient hexameter in its effect upon us moderns .... The received English type , in its general outlines , is , for England , the necessary given type of this metre ; it is by rendering the metrical beat of its pattern , not by rendering the accentual beat of it , that the English language has adapted the Greek hexameter .... I look with hope towards continued attempts at perfecting and employing this rhythm ; but my belief in the immediate success of such attempts is far less confident than has been supposed . ” ( See the whole passage , On Translating Homer , pp . 275-284 . )</p>

   <p>In like manner Mr. Swinburne says : “ I must say how inexplicable it seems to me that Mr. Arnold , of all men , should be a patron of English hexameters . His own I have tried in vain to reduce by scansion into any metrical feet at all ; they look like nothing on earth , and sound like anapests broken up and driven wrong ....

     <l n="12">Use of Classical Measures in English . 1899 . )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Mr. Stone , like the Elizabethan classical versifiers , seeks to write purely quantitative verse in English , and , so far from aiming at the same time to preserve the rhythm of the usual English hexameter , he regards the clash between accent and quantity as a beauty rather than a defect . The verses he intends to be read “ with the natural accent unimpaired , ” the reader listening for the regular quantities at the same time .</p>
   <p>The views of Mr. Stone on the nature of English accent and quantity are perhaps unique among modern writers on the subject . “ The ordinary unemphatic English accent is exactly a raising of pitch , and nothing more , ” as in Greek . “ The accent of emphasis is something quite different in character from the ordinary accent . ” To those who insist that to them the second syllable of carpenter is distinctly short , Mr. Stone replies : “ You are associating yourselves by such an admission with the vulgar actors of Plautus rather than the educated readers of Virgil ; ” — a truly terrible charge ! Mr. Stone gives an interesting critical history of earlier efforts to introduce classical measures into English . His monograph is reprinted , but without the specimen translation , as the second part of the 1901 edition of Robert Bridges 's Milton 's Prosody .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>Puttenham 's treatise on English poetry , which followed Webbe 's ( 1589 ) , and was the most thorough treatment of the subject written in the Elizabethan period , also discussed the “ reformed versifying , ” but with less respect . The chapter is entitled : “ How if all maner of sodaine innovations were not very scandalous , specially in the lawes of any langage or arte , the use of the Greeke and Latine feete might be brought into our vulgar Poesie , and with good grace inough . ” ( Arber Reprint of The Arte of English Poesie , p . 126 . ) Puttenham seems to see the relations of quantity and accent somewhat more clearly than most of his contemporaries , and while he gives rules for adapting English words to quantitative prosody , he is disposed to think that “ peradventure with us Englishmen it be somewhat too late to admit a new invention of feete and times that our forefathers never used nor never observed till this day ” ( p. 132 ) .</p>

His attack on the customary English rimed verse was answered by the poet laureate , Samuel Daniel , who published in the same year ( 1602 ) his Defence of Ryme against a Pamphlet entituled Observations in the Art of English Poesie . “ Wherein is demonstratively prooved that Ryme is the fittest harmonie of words that comports with our Language . ” Daniel struck at the root of all the principles of the classical versifiers ,— the supreme authority of the classics . “ We are the children of nature as well as they , ” he exclaims with reference to the ancients . “ It is not the observing of Trochaiques nor their Iambiques , that will make our writings ought the wiser . ” And he expounds the English accentual verse-system with clearness and vigor .

I have distinctly stated that the English hexameter is not constructed upon those canons . ” He further appealed to the success of the hexameter in Germany , and concluded : “ I am glad that I have made the experiment , and quite satisfied with the result .

I am glad to hear ( being a lazy man ) that I have more license than I wish for ; but I do think that , with proper care , you may have as many spondees , without hurting the rhythm , in English as you have in Greek , and my ear is tortured by a trochee instead .... I must try for Homer 's average of a spondee a line . ”</p>
   <p>VII . IMITATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL FRENCH LYRICAL FORMS</p>
   <p>A number of artificial lyrical forms , originating in the ingenuity of the mediæval Provençal poets , were adopted by the Middle English imitators of the Romance lyrists , and were revived with no little vigor in the Victorian period . Chief among the influential models for these forms , in early times , were the poems of Machault ( 1284-1377 ) , Deschamps ( 1328-1415 ) , Froissart ( 1337-1410 ) , and Villon ( 1431-1485 ) . Again in the seventeenth century such forms as the rondeau were revived in France by Voiture ( 1598-1648 ) , but with little effect in England . Finally , in the nineteenth century , the forms were reintroduced by M. Théodore de Banville , and later into England by Mr. Lang , Mr. Austin Dobson , Mr. Gosse , and others . For the history of these fashions in outline , see the admirable introduction to Mr. Gleeson White 's Ballades and Rondeaus ( 1893 ) ; also Mr. Andrew Lang 's Lays and Lyrics of Old France ( 1872 ) ; Mr. Austin Dobson 's “ Note on some Foreign Forms of Verse , ” in the collection of Latter Day Lyrics ( 1878 ) ; and an article by Mr. Edmund Gosse in the Cornhill Magazine , July , 1877 .</p>
   <p>Says Mr. Dobson : “ It may be conceded that the majority of the forms now in question are not at present suited for ... the treatment of grave or elevated themes . What is modestly advanced for some of them ... is that they may add a new charm of buoyancy ,— a lyric freshness ,— to amatory and familiar verse , already too much condemned to faded measures and out-worn cadences . Further , ... that they are admirable vehicles for the expression of trifles or jeux d'esprit . They have also a humbler and obscurer use . If , to quote the once-hackneyed , but now too-much-forgotten maxim of Pope —</p>
   <p>‘ Those move easiest that have learned to dance , ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">what better discipline , among others , could possibly be devised for</l>
     <l n="2">‘ those about to versify ’ than a course of Rondeaux , Triolets , and</l>
     <l n="3">Ballades ? ” Mr. Dobson refers to the article by Mr. Gosse already cited ,</l>
     <l n="4">and “ to the Odes Funambulesques , the Petit Traité de Poésie</l>
     <l n="5">Française , and other works of M. Théodore de Banville . To M. de</l>
     <l n="6">Banville in particular and to the second French Romantic School in</l>
     <l n="7">general , the happy modernization in France of the old measures of Marot ,</l>
     <l n="8">Villon , and Charles of Orleans is mainly to be ascribed . ” ( Latter Day</l>
     <l n="9">Lyrics , ed . W. D. Adams , pp . 334 ff . )[ 47 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Says Mr. Gleeson White : “ The taste for these tours de force in the art of verse-making is no doubt an acquired one ; yet to quote the first attempt to produce a lyric with a repeated burden would take one back to the earliest civilization .... Whether the first refrains were used for decorative effect only , or to give the singer time to recollect or improvise the next verse , it matters little , since the once mere adjunct was made in later French use an integral and vital part of the verse . The charm of these strictly written verses is undoubtedly increased by some knowledge of their technical rules .... To approach ideal perfection , nothing less than implicit obedience to all the rules is the first element of success ; but the task is by no means finished there . Every quality that poetry demands , whether clearness of thought , elegance of expression , harmonious sound , or faultless rhythm , is needed as much in these shapes as in unfettered verse .... It may be said , without fear of exaggeration , that all the qualities required to form a perfect lyric in poetry are equally needful here , plus a great many special ones the forms themselves demand . To the students of any art there is always a peculiar charm when the highest difficulties are surmounted with such ease that the consummate art is hidden to all who know not the magic password to unveil it . ” ( Ballades and Rondeaus , Introduction , pp . xli , xlii . ) “ No one is compelled to use these complex forms , but if chosen , their laws must be obeyed to the letter if success is to be obtained . The chief pleasure they yield consists in the apparent spontaneity , which is the result of genius , if genius be indeed the art of taking infinite pains ; or , if that definition is rejected , they must yet exhibit the art which conceals art , whether by intense care in every minute detail , or a happy faculty for naturally wearing these fetters . ” ( Ib ., pp . l , li . )</p>

    <head>A .— THE BALLADE</head>
    <head>The ballade commonly consists of three stanzas , with an envoy . In modern usage the stanzas usually contain either eight or ten lines , and the envoy half as many as the stanza ; but in earlier usage both stanza and envoy varied , and the latter might be omitted altogether . The rimes in all the stanzas must be identical in the corresponding lines , but the riming words must be different . The most characteristic element is the refrain ,— the keynote of the poem ,— which forms the last line of each stanza , including the envoy . The favorite rime-scheme for the eight-line stanza is ababbcbc , with the envoy bcbc . Mr. White says of the envoy that it “ is not only a dedication , but should be the peroration of the subject , and richer in its wording and more stately in its imagery than the preceding verses , to convey the climax of the whole matter , and avoid the suspicion that it is a mere postscript . ”</head>

   <p>Here Chaucer follows the rules of the ballade carefully , but in the “ rime royal ” stanza . It will be noticed that the rime-word “ al ” seems to be repeated , but it is used each time in a distinct sense , hence — according to the rules of Chaucer 's time , as of modern French — is regarded as a different rime-word each time .</p>

The Compleynt of Venus , like Fortune , is in three ballades , with one envoy , and is of special interest as being based on three French ballades of Graunson .<span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span>Says Chaucer :</p>

   <p>There is also an extended form of the ballade , called the Chant Royal , with five stanzas and envoy , the stanzas consisting of eleven verses . The usual rime-scheme is ababccddede , with envoy ddede . For admirable specimens , see Mr. Dobson 's Dance of Death and Mr. Gosse 's Praise of Dionysus , in Ballades and Rondeaus , pp . 98 , 100 . Mr. White says of this form : “ The chant royal in the old form is usually devoted to the unfolding of an allegory in its five stanzas , the envoy supplying the key ; but this is not always observed in modern examples . Whatever be the subject , however , it must always march in stately rhythm with splendid imagery , using all the poetic adornments of sonorous , highly-wrought lines and rich embroidery of words , to clothe a theme in itself a lofty one . Unless the whole poem is constructed with intense care , the monotony of its sixty-one lines rhymed on five sounds is unbearable . ” ( Ballades and Rondeaus , Introduction , p . liv . )</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>B .— THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL</head>
    <head>Rondel is the old French form of the word rondeau , and the terms are therefore naturally interchangeable . They have been applied to a number of different forms , all characterized by a refrain so repeated as to link together different parts of the structure . Two of these forms are particularly familiar . The first ( called more commonly the rondel ) consists of fourteen lines , with only two rimes ; the first two lines constitute the refrain , and are commonly repeated as the seventh and eighth and again as the thirteenth and fourteenth . The rime-scheme varies , but is often ABba , abAB , abbaAB ( the capitals indicating the repeated lines of the refrain ) . Sometimes the form is shortened to thirteen lines , the second line of the refrain not being repeated at the close . The second principal form ( called more commonly the rondeau ) consists of thirteen lines , with two rimes , and an unrimed refrain , taken from the opening words of the first line , which follows the eighth line and is again repeated at the end . The common rime-scheme is aabba , aab ( refrain ) , aabba ( refrain ) . Both these forms are found in early French poetry , together with many variations . The modern distinction between rondeau and rondel is artificial but convenient .</head>

   <p>Besides the rondeaus found in the Wyatt MS ., three poems of Wyatt 's , published in Tottel 's Songs and Sonnets ( 1557 ) , were evidently intended as rondeaus ( see Arber 's Reprint , pp . 53 , 73 ) . The editor , not understanding the form or thinking it too unfamiliar to be popular , seems to have changed it to a sort of sonnet , omitting the refrain at the end and making a complete line of it as the ninth of the poem . These hidden rondeaus were discussed by Mr. Dobson in the Athenæum for 1878 ( vol . i. p. 380 ) ; see also Alscher 's Sir Thomas Wyatt und seine Stellung , etc .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Mr. Swinburne has reintroduced the old word-form “ roundel , ” to distinguish this style of rondeau , of his own devising , with nine long lines , riming aba , bab , aba , the refrain riming also with the b lines .</p>
   <p>C .— THE VILLANELLE</p>
   <p>This highly intricate form was originally used for pastoral or idyllic verse , and it is commonly reserved , as Mr. Dobson observes , for subjects “ full of sweetness and simplicity . ” In its typical form it consists of nineteen lines , divided into five groups or stanzas of three and one of four . There are but two rimes , and the two verses which constitute the refrain recur again and again , line 1 reappearing as line 6 , line 12 , and line 18 , while line 3 reappears as line 9 , line 15 , and line 19 . The rime scheme of all the tercets is aba , of the conclusion abaa . Those villanelles are considered most highly finished in which the refrain recurs with slightly different significations .</p>
   <p>On the history of this form , see J. Boulmier 's Les Villanelles , Paris , 1878 . The modern development of the villanelle has been largely influenced by the work of Passerat ( 1534-1602 ) , whose most famous villanelle is the following specimen :</p>

    <head>E .— THE SESTINA</head>
    <head>This form , although originally found in Provençal like the others of the group , has been more used in Italy than in France , and , as the English form of the word indicates , was introduced into England under Italian influence . It was invented at the end of the thirteenth century , by the troubadour Arnaut Daniel , celebrated in the following specimen . The common form of the sestina has six stanzas of six lines each , with a tercet at the end . There is usually no rime , but the stanzas are based on six end-words , which are the same in all stanzas ; in the tercet three of these words are used in the middle of the lines , and three at the ends . The order of the end-words changes in each stanza according to a complex system : thus ( in the common modern form ) if the end-words of the first stanza be represented by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , the order in the second stanza will be 6 , 1 , 5 , 2 , 4 , 3 ; in the third , 3 , 6 , 4 , 1 , 2 , 5 ; in the fourth , 5 , 3 , 2 , 6 , 1 , 4 ; in the fifth , 4 , 5 , 1 , 3 , 6 , 2 ; in the sixth , 2 , 4 , 6 , 5 , 3 , 1 . Sometimes the end-words also rime by twos and threes .</head>

   <p>The Virelai , which we have seen was one of the forms used by Chaucer , though not represented in his extant poetry , has been but slightly imitated in English . It was a poem of indeterminate length , composed of longer and shorter lines , the longer lines in each stanza riming , the shorter lines in the same stanza also riming , while in the succeeding stanza the short-line rime of the previous stanza became the long-line rime . The last stanza took the unrepeated rime of the first stanza as its new rime ; so that in the whole poem each rime was used in two stanzas . Charles Cotton , one of whose rondeaus has been quoted , also wrote a virelai . A modern specimen , by Mr. John Payne , is quoted in Ballades and Rondeaus , p. 276 .</p>
   <p>The Pantoum is another very interesting form belonging in this group rather than elsewhere , although it originated not in France but Malaysia . It was imitated in French by Victor Hugo and other poets , and through French influence has found a place in English verse . It consists of an indeterminate number of stanzas of four lines each , the second and fourth line of each stanza being repeated as the first and third of the succeeding stanza , while the second and fourth lines of the last stanza repeat the first and third lines of the first stanza . Thus the whole forms a sort of interwoven circle , and is used most appropriately to represent any kind of monotony ,— the dull round of repetition .

    <p>PART THREE</p>
   <p>THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE<span type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span></p>
   <p>Nearly all modern writers on the theory of verse have admitted that English words have no fixed syllabic quantities such as are postulated for the classical languages , but that English quantities , so far as they exist , are variable and ( in part at least ) subjective in character . To this it is true there are exceptions , chiefly among the poets , like some of those considered in the preceding section on Imitations of Classical Metres .</p>
   <p>Writers who have agreed that English words have no fixed quantities , are still at variance as to the relation of the element of syllabic time to the element of accent in English verse . Two extremes may at once be distinguished : that represented by the familiar statement that our rhythms differ from those of classical poetry in being based wholly on accent , and that represented most notably by the late Sidney Lanier , who held that syllabic time-values in English verse are as exact and regular ( hence as accurately measurable ) as the notes of music . Lanier applied his theory with admirable consistency , and represented all sorts of English verse , even that of the Anglo-Saxon period , in musical notation . He is almost universally regarded , however , as having been led by the analogy between music and poetry to carry his method to quite impossible lengths . The most characteristic example of this is his representation of the familiar “ blank verse ” measure in “ three-four ” time , each accented syllable being given a time-value twice as long as that of the adjacent unaccented syllable — a method of reading which can easily be shown to be contrary to all common practice . It should not be forgotten , however , that a debt of gratitude is owed Mr. Lanier for having been one of the first to emphasize adequately the fact that verse , like music , is rhythmical sound .</p>
   <p>Besides those who make English verse to depend wholly on accent , and those who give it time-values equally regular and measurable with those of music , there is a third class disposed to confuse the two elements of quantity and accent . Of this class was Edgar Poe , who in his essay on The Rationale of Verse constantly spoke of accented and unaccented syllables as “ long ” and “ short , ” respectively , and was even disposed to carry the identification into Latin verse itself . This essay of Poe 's has lately been defended by Mr. John M. Robertson , in the interesting Appendix to his New Essays toward a Critical Method ( 1897 ) . Unfortunately Mr. Robertson seems to have perpetuated deliberately the confusion which he found in Poe in the use of the terms “ accent ” and “ quantity . ” He even says that the attempt to distinguish them is ill-founded , “ that quantity in speaking must amount substantially to the same thing as stress , ” and , again , that “ Poe 's identification of stress with length is perfectly sound . ” Whatever be the fundamental fact here , the use of terms cannot be commended . If quantity is swallowed up in accent , so that accent alone dominates our verse , that is one thing ; if the conditions are such that a heavy stress and a long quantity nearly always coincide , that is also a possible doctrine ; but that is not to say that the two things should be identified . If all tall men wear long coats , or if all men — tall and short — wear long coats , it follows in neither case that tallness and long-coatedness are the same thing . It is a mere matter of physics that duration of sound and intensity of sound are perfectly distinguishable , and that they have no necessary connection with each other . The problem is : how are they related in practice ?</p>
   <p>It has already been observed that Mr. Lanier did good service in emphasizing the analogy between music and poetry , but that he carried the analogy too far . It may , therefore , be worth while to consider at just this point the elements of likeness and of difference in the two forms of art . Both are forms of rhythmical art : music and verse are alike rhythmical sound . Lanier showed with sufficient certainty that rhythm is dependent upon both time and accent . He said , to be sure , that “ time is the essential ” element ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>but this does not seem to have been altogether what he meant , for he himself pointed out that the ear insistently marks off time-elements by the sense of variation of stress , even when there is no real variation , as in the tick-tack of the clock . He also pointed out that accent marks the rhythm of music quite as truly as that of verse , the rule being that ordinarily the first note of each measure shall receive a special stress . It seems , then , that the rhythm of music is based on the recurrence of accented sounds at equal time-intervals . The same thing is true of the rhythm of verse . For every kind of metre there is a normal verse-rhythm which is present in the mind as the basis on which the verse is built up , no matter how many variations may constantly occur . This normal rhythm is formed by a succession of accents at exactly equal time-intervals ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>such as can be marked off by a metronome , or by the mechanical beating of the foot on the floor . We realize that the verse as commonly read frequently departs from this regularity of intervals ; but without the regularity as a norm to which to refer it , we should not recognize it as verse . The normal accent-interval we call a “ foot . ”</p>
   <p>Exception must therefore be taken , it seems to me , to another contention of Mr. Robertson 's ; namely , that “ there is no time-unit . ” “ Our feet , ” he says , “ are a pure convention , and the sole rhythmic fact is the fluctuant relativity of long and short , or stress and slur . ” I am glad to be able to believe that the fundamental rhythmic fact is something more definite than this .<span type="note_anchor">[ 52 ]</span>But the latest writer on the subject , Mr. Mark Liddell , in his Introduction to the Scientific Study of Poetry , joins Mr. Robertson in finding no feet in English verse . Nay , he represents the metrist who makes use of the old conventions of rhythmical measurement as one who will “ flounder ceaselessly amid the scattered timbers of iambuses , spondees , dactyls , tribrachs , never reaching the firm ground of truth ” ! Mr. Liddell points out that we do not pronounce English words , even in verse , with mechanically regular alternations of stress ; and he rejects the explanation that there is nevertheless a typical form in the poet 's and the reader 's mind , on the ground that it is “ a strange state of affairs that the æsthetically imperfect should produce a greater pleasure than the æsthetically perfect . ” Strange , perhaps , but as familiar as sunrise , if by “ æsthetically perfect ” we mean absolutely regular . Here we need to recur to the analogy of music , where the phenomenon in question is so obvious . Let any one attempt to follow a symphony with a metronome in his hand , and he will soon discover that if the metronome represents the æsthetically perfect rhythm , the orchestra represents a more pleasurable imperfection . Its accelerations and retardations carry on a continual conflict with the typical time of the music , yet that typical time is not only printed on every sheet , but is in the mind of every player . It is precisely so with verse .</p>
   <p>It is true , of course , that the variations from regularity of rhythm are more numerous and conspicuous in verse than in music . The reason is obvious : the sounds of verse have constantly to effect a compromise between the typical rhythm to which they are set and the irregular stress-and time-variations of human speech , while music has no such complicated task . Lyrical verse , being closest to music , keeps the typical rhythm freest from interruption ; and it is worthy of remark that Mr. Liddell 's study of English rhythms is based very largely on those of a non-lyrical character , although he himself points out ( p. 271 ) that these are the least regular . The drama is dominated , most of all forms of verse , by the necessity of representing natural human speech ; hence it is not the place to look for the fundamental laws of verse at their purest .</p>
   <p>There is , then , a unit of time on which all verse-rhythms , like all musical rhythms , are based ; and this is what we commonly call in music the measure , and in verse , the foot , I shall recur to this matter a little later in considering the terminology of the subject ; for the present let us return to the relations of verse and music . Both , we have seen , are based on the recurrence of accented sounds at equal time-intervals . There is some difference , however , in the emphasis which one naturally places on the respective parts of the statement . In music we feel that the fact of chief importance is that the measures shall be equal in time , while the recurring accent seems a mere means of marking this equality ; but in verse we feel that the chief fact is that the accents shall recur , the equality of time-intervals being in a sense a secondary source of pleasure . In music , therefore , as we have seen , we treat departures from regularity of time-intervals as somewhat more exceptional than in verse . But the rhythm would suffer , would even disappear , were either element wholly removed .</p>
   <p>If we look for further distinctions between verse and music , we find them in the separate sounds which go to make up the unit-measures . Not only are the measures of music of mathematically equal length , but all the sounds bear exact time-relations to each other : each is either half as long , or twice as long , or a quarter as long , or four times as long , as its neighbor . On the other hand , the number of separate sounds in the measure constantly varies ; it is sufficient that the total length be that of the full measure . In verse these conditions are reversed . The separate syllables , while they doubtless vary in length , are not mathematically coördinated as to duration by the ordinary reader . It is almost as difficult to say just what the time-relation of any two adjacent syllables is , as to be sure that one is stressed just twice as strongly as the other . On the other hand , the number of syllables in the foot ( in good modern English verse ) is tolerably constant .</p>
   <p>For the sake of completeness , one may add two other fundamental distinctions which , apart from the elements of rhythm , differentiate verse from music . Music , apart from rhythm , characteristically depends on variation of pitch , and only incidentally ( as in the case of the use of different instruments in orchestration ) on variation of sound-quality ; whereas verse , apart from rhythm , characteristically depends on variation of sound-quality ,— that is , on the different sounds of the different words ,— and only incidentally on changes of pitch . Finally , the changing sounds of music are only vaguely symbolic , while the changing sounds of verse are symbolic of definite ideas .</p>
   <p>For the sake of easy comparison we may put these observations in a rough sort of table :</p>
   <p>MUSIC VERSE Rhythmical Sound , i. e .</p>
   <p>Recurrence of accented sounds Recurrence of accented sounds at equal time-intervals . at equal time-intervals .</p>
   <p>Separate sounds mathematically Separate sounds not mathematically related in length , and constantly related in length , and varying in number and arrangement . generally with unchanged number and arrangement .</p>
   <p>Apart from rhythm , dependent on Apart from rhythm , dependent on variation of pitch ( incidentally variation of sound-quality on sound-quality ) . ( incidentally on pitch ) .</p>
   <p>Sounds vaguely symbolic . Sounds symbolic of definite ideas .</p>
   <p>Let us now consider more closely the time-values of the separate syllables of verse , asking just what we mean by a “ long ” or a “ short ” syllable in English . It has already been indicated that the ear recognizes no such fixed proportions in the length of our syllables as are recognized for musical notes , or as are postulated for the syllables of Greek and Latin verse . It must also be remembered that the terms “ long ” and “ short , ” as commonly used of English vowels , are of little significance for the matter of real quantity . They are applied for historical reasons , and do not describe present facts . Thus we call the o in “ hotel ” long , and that in “ cot ” short ; but it is fairly clear that the o of “ cot ” takes rather more time , as commonly uttered , than that of “ hotel . ” The so-called “ short o ” is , in fact , a sound so open that it has lost the o-quality . In the same way what we call “ long a ” is a short-e sound diphthongized . We cannot be said to preserve in modern English any single vowels with fixed long quantity , such as we hear in German words like Saal and See ,— sounds which obviously take more time in utterance than others .</p>
   <p>Can we speak accurately , then , of long syllables and short syllables in modern English ? It may be said that we have a large number of genuine diphthongs ; and such double sounds , especially where they are so open as to require unusual effort on the part of the vocal organs ( like - ow , for example ) , may be assumed to take a longer time in utterance than monophthongs . Even such a sound as is represented by - au or - aw , though it has but slight diphthongal quality , seems to sound longer than most monophthongs . But in none of these cases does ordinary pronunciation make the sound-length at all conspicuous , except where it coincides with strong stress ; and it requires a moment 's reasoning to convince one 's self that the vowel in fine is any longer than that in fan . It is more than doubtful , then , whether our vowel sounds can be regarded as of significance for metrical time . A word like “ saw ” or “ now , ” occurring in such a place in the verse as to be passed over with the briefest and lightest utterance , would be pronounced with rapidity by the ordinary reader , with no thought that the vowel-sound was too “ long . ”</p>
   <p>But in the earlier languages a syllable might be long , not only from the presence of a long vowel , but also from the presence of two or more consonants following the vowel . May this be said to hold good for modern English ? In general , prolonged consonantal sounds seem to be avoided , as in the case of vowels . We pass over them rapidly , and have , for instance , no such clearly stopped syllables due to double consonants as are heard in Italian words like madonna . Yet we cannot doubt that two or three consonants require more time than one , and in words like strength , flushed , fists , and the like , every one would find the consonantal length perceptible . More than this , two consonants often serve to “ close ” the preceding syllable , by making it impossible to run the consonant at the end of it over into the following syllable , and hence really lengthen it . This , of course , is the reason why the first syllable of the Latin avis is said to be short , but that of alvus to be long . The Elizabethan metrists tried to apply these Latin rules of “ quantity by position ” to all English words ; and many modern English writers , who have been trained from childhood in the appreciation of Latin quantities , easily perceive the differing consonantal quantities of English words . These quantities may , then , certainly be said to exist ; but in ordinary English pronunciation , and to the ordinary , untrained English ear , they must be strongly marked in order to attract attention . When thus strongly marked , they doubtless play some part in the structure of verse . In some lines attributed to Raleigh ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ His desire is a dureless content ,</l>
     <l n="2">And a trustless joy , ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">the syllable trust-occupies the time of two syllables ; the typical</l>
     <l n="4">metre would require something like</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ And a pitiless joy . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now , the fact that trust-is a noticeably long syllable , especially when closed by the following l , makes it well fitted to fill the place of two syllables ; and we should find the line distinctly less pleasing if a short syllable were there instead . Boundless would do as well , because equally long ; trusty would not be quite so good ; silly would be very bad . Conversely , when a noticeably long syllable occupies the place of a light syllable , in rapid tri-syllabic verse , we feel that the verse is injured . Mr. William Larminie criticises a line of Mr. Swinburne 's on this ground ,—</p>
   <p>“ Time sheds them like snow on strange regions ;"[ 53 ]</p>
   <p>the combination - ange , with its final - nj sound , made still longer by the following r , and preceded , too , by the combination n-st , has too much quantity for the place where it stands in the verse . In the verse of inferior writers many worse cases could easily be found . These illustrations , then , may serve to show that while we do not coördinate our consonantal syllable-lengths as absolute “ shorts ” and “ longs , ” we perceive certain degrees of length , and find these playing a part in our verse .</p>
   <p>So much for intrinsic quantity as found in English syllables . But there is much more to be said for syllables made long or short at the will of the speaker , under certain conditions . If we address a friend in surprise , saying , “ Why , John ! ” we not only throw a heavy stress on both the words , but also perceptibly prolong them . In like manner , we realize that unimportant words , especially proclitics ( like the italicized words in the phrase “ The land of the free ” ) are not only unstressed , but are hurried over in shorter moments than the accented words . Examples like this suggest what may in fact be expressed in a general statement , that accented syllables are very commonly prolonged . This is not , as we have seen , from any essential connection between the nature of accent and the nature of quantity . In certain cases , unaccented syllables even show a tendency to length beyond that of those bearing the stress , as in words like follow , dying , and others where the final sound is easily prolonged . The coincidence of stress and length , then , is due simply to the operation of the same cause — the grammatical or rhetorical importance of the syllable in question . This fact , that the important ( stressed ) syllables are likely to be held a little longer than the others , will not warrant us in representing them as twice as long , in the exact mathematical relations of musical notes ; but it may explain why a musician like Lanier tried to represent them in such notation . It must also be the cause of Mr. Robertson 's attempt to identify quantity and stress . His statement that “ quantity in fact , in spoken verse , consists of stress and of the consonantal total of syllables , ” may be regarded as much more satisfactory than those already quoted from his essay . It is , however , not quite accurate .</p>
   <p>Still another kind of relative syllable-length remains to be considered , and for metrical purposes it is probably the most important . The accents of English words not only vary in degree according to the different stresses which they receive in different prose sentences , but in verse they are made artificially to vary also so as to conform as closely as possible to the scheme of the metre . Thus the first syllable of the word over is accented far more strongly when it occurs at the opening of a dactylic verse ,</p>
   <p>“ Over the ocean wave , ”</p>
   <p>than when it occurs at the opening of an anapestic verse ,</p>
   <p>“ Over land , over sea . ”</p>
   <p>This being the case with accent , which tends to be strongly fixed in English words , we might naturally expect that it would be still more clearly the case with the element of time ; and so it is . Syllables will be lengthened and shortened by the reader in order to preserve as nearly as possible the fundamental equal time-intervals between the principal accents . This is most easily recognized , and most commonly practised , in the case where syllables are shortened because there are more of them than the normal scheme of the verse would imply . The old “ tumbling verse ” of our ancestors depended on this principle , and so did the revival of it in Coleridge 's Christabel . For example :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ A little door she opened straight ,</l>
     <l n="2">All in the middle of the gate ,</l>
     <l n="3">The gate that was ironed within and without ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where an army in battle array had marched out . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Here the rhythm of the last verse is brought into the four-beat measure of the first verse , by passing lightly and rapidly over all syllables save the four that mark the metre . In prose , the word marched would be stressed quite as much as the word out , but there is no difficulty in reducing the stress in reading the verse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>It cannot be said , however , that there is no difficulty in reducing its length , for the final consonant combination - cht takes up considerable time , and the whole word follows a syllable ( had ) which has been closed and so lengthened by the d + m. Sensitive readers would probably agree , therefore , that the quantity in this verse is too much for the smoothness of the rhythm . On the other hand , the long syllable ironed helps us to fill the place of the light syllable which is missing after it , and we find the rhythm easier than it would be in this form :</p>
   <p>“ The gate that was ironed both within and without . ”</p>
   <p>Once more , for the sake of convenience , let us attempt to put our conclusions into the form of a summary . An English syllable may be said to be long , not absolutely but relatively , from :</p>
   <note>1 . The naturally long character of its vowel-sound , due either to open quality or diphthongization .</note>
   <p>2 . The presence of two or more consonants which require a perceptible time for utterance .</p>
   <p>3 . Prolongation by the speaker ( a ) because of the importance of the syllable , or ( b ) because of the time which it ought to occupy in the scheme of the verse .</p>
   <p>The artificial lengthening and shortening of syllables , then , is constantly and naturally practised in the reading of verse which has a strong lyrical swing such as guides the reader into a sense of its structure . In verse more subtle and less lyrical in character the time-intervals are not so strongly marked , and by the ear not trained to listen for rhythm they are not so easily observed . The five-stress iambic line , especially when unrimed , has developed far more freedom and subtlety in English poetry than any other measure , and it is to this that one finds these writers invariably turning who wish to prove that our verse is not based on regular time-intervals . A verse like this :</p>
   <p>“ The lone couch of his everlasting sleep , ”</p>
   <p>if read as an ordinary prose phrase , has no obvious metrical character . The second foot ( “ couch of ” ) inverts the normal order of accent and no-accent , and in common speech the second and third syllables would be long and followed by a phrase-pause , while the fourth and fifth syllables would be made very short and jointed closely to what follows . There is no rhythm in such a group of words . But when we know that they are part of a poem in five-stress verse , we can readjust them so as to approach more closely to the rhythmical scheme in our minds . We cannot accent either of or his , without destroying the sense ; nor can we deprive either lone or couch of its accent ; but we can lengthen the words of his beyond their natural time in speech , pronouncing them more deliberately , and we can also , perhaps , diminish the phrase-pause after couch . This would tend to equalize the five time-intervals to which the verse , as a verse , should fit itself . It would be too much to say that this is what the ordinary reader would do , because the ordinary reader is likely to have his mind fixed on expressing the sense , neglecting the rhythm which is equally an element of the poetry ; but it is what the careful reader could do without difficulty .</p>
   <p>The first line of Paradise Lost ,</p>
   <p>“ Of man 's first disobedience , and the fruit , ”</p>
   <p>always a favorite specimen for metrists to dissect , is of like character . Mr. Robertson , in the essay already cited , makes considerable use of this verse as showing the vanity of the usual method of dividing verses into equal feet . He quotes approvingly Professor Shairp 's account of the way in which Clough analyzed the line : “ The two feet ‘ first disobe - ’ took up the time of four syllables , two iambic feet : the voice rested awhile on the word ‘ first ’ ; then passed swiftly over ‘ diso - , ’ then rested again on ‘ be - ’ so as to recover the previous hurry . ” Now this seems to be merely a description of the way in which the words would be uttered in prose , and to neglect the rhythm of the poem in which they stand . In the second foot one can and should give the syllable dis - full syllabic time , instead of hurrying over it as in prose speech ,— a rendering made easy by the fact that it frequently has a marked secondary accent . Conversely , one can give first somewhat less time than it would occupy in prose , without thereby diminishing its accent . The word and , in the fourth foot , would in prose utterance be allowed almost no time-value ; and it may be treated in the same way in the verse , by permitting the pause at the comma to fill up the normal time of the foot . It would seem to be better , however , to give and a fairly distinct utterance for metrical purposes ( without , of course , adding any stress ) , and thus to approach more closely to the scheme of time-intervals . It is highly improbable that any one would read this verse — or almost any other verse of Paradise Lost — with such exact observance of the equal time-intervals as would appear in regular lyrical poetry . We have already seen that blank verse departs more constantly from the typical scheme of the measure than any other of our verse-forms . Nevertheless , the reader with a well-trained ear listens always for the flow of the typical metre underneath the surface irregularities , and , by a delicate adjustment of syllable-lengths , can bring the poet 's words into far more rhythmical utterance than they would find in prose .</p>
   <p>There is one other method of varying the time-elements in verse which has already been suggested by what was said of the pause at the comma in the line of Paradise Lost . It will be seen very generally that light syllables , such as one wishes to utter in brief periods of time , are found on either side of the phrase-pauses in our verse .</p>
   <p>“ The first in valor , as the first in place ”</p>
   <p>is a typical line in this respect . The natural pause , indicated by the comma , takes up part of the time of the third foot , which there are no syllables fitted wholly to fill . It might almost be said that , in ordinary five-stress verse , such verses are quite as numerous as those with five complete feet . The pause satisfies the ear , so far as the time-intervals are concerned , quite as well as a long syllable .</p>
   <p>Pauses not only fill up the incomplete time of a foot containing only short syllables , but they also fill the time of wholly missing syllables . In the verse</p>
   <p>“ Come from the dying moon , and blow ”</p>
   <p>we start out with trisyllabic rhythm , but have only two syllables in the second and in the third foot . It does not seem certain whether the missing syllable after dying is to have its place filled by a pause or by a prolongation of either or both of the syllables dy-ing — perhaps by all three means combined . In the same way the missing syllable after moon may have its place filled either by the prolongation of the oo , or by the pause indicated by the comma , or by both . But in other cases the pause occupies the entire syllable-moment ; for examples , see under Pauses in pages 20-22 above . The whole matter was well summed up in Lanier 's saying that “ rhythm may be dependent on silences ” as well as on sounds .</p>
   <p>Let us now try to gather what we have been considering into the form of definite statements regarding the place of the time-element in our verse .</p>
   <p>1 . In the normal verse , accents appear at equal time-intervals . This , of course , does not preclude all manner of variations ; the unit of measure is not the distance between the accents as they are found in each verse , but between the points where they belong in the typical metre .</p>
   <p>2 . There is a tendency toward the coincidence of long and accented , and of short and unaccented , syllables . This we have seen to be true in two different senses . In the first place , an accented syllable is likely to be lengthened for the same reason that it is accented — because of its relative importance in the place where it stands . In the second place , syllables noticeably long are avoided in those places in the verse where the accent does not fall , and are preferred where the stress is heavy .</p>
   <p>3 . In the reading of verse , the length of the syllables is varied artificially , so as to tend to preserve the equal time-intervals .</p>
   <p>4 . In like manner , pauses are introduced where syllables are short or wanting , to preserve these intervals .</p>
   <p>It is quite possible that these laws might be stated more fully and definitely . In Anglo-Saxon verse the conditions were perhaps not so different from those of modern English as we are likely to think ; there we know that the principal stresses of the verse always fell on long syllables , and scholars like Sievers , by analyzing the remains of our early poetry , have formulated certain other laws as to the position and relations of the short syllables . If similar laws were to be formulated for our modern verse , we should probably find them no more perplexing than our ancestors would find those we have formulated for their verse . In every case the “ law ” is only an attempt to express what the ear has long known and obeyed . Mr. Goodell , in an article on “ Quantity in English Verse , ” in the Proceedings of the American Philological Society for 1885 , attempted to do for our verse what has just been suggested . He stated such laws as these :</p>
   <p>“ The thesis becomes a triseme if the next syllable bears the ictus . No syllable can be placed in this position which is incapable of prolongation . ”</p>
   <p>“ If the arsis is monosyllabic , a short vowel in the thesis followed by a single consonant is not lengthened by the ictus ; the arsis is instead prolonged . ”</p>
   <p>“ With arsis monosyllabic , the strong tendency is to make the thesis short . ”</p>
   <p>Perhaps these rules are on the right track ; the terminology is somewhat difficult , and makes one hesitate to criticise carefully . But since , as we have seen , the terms “ long ” and “ short , ” as applied to English syllables , have come to be so purely relative , since our syllabic quantities vary so much at the will of the reader , and since the whole matter of the reading of our verse is in good measure one of subjective interpretation , it seems very doubtful whether any statements more explicit than those already laid down would be found of practical service .</p>
   <p>Finally , we come back to the question whether we shall use for English verse the classical terminology which has for so long been applied to it . Those who object to such terminology do so either on the ground that it implies that English accented and unaccented syllables are equivalent respectively to Latin long and short syllables , or on the still more fundamental ground that there is nothing in our verse which can properly be called a “ foot . ” It is undoubtedly true that the use of terms based on quantity has given rise to some confusion when applied to phenomena based on accent , yet the terms are now understood with as fair a degree of clearness as any terms relating to so disputed a subject as English verse ; and it seems very doubtful whether it is not easier to explain them than to introduce new ones . Experiments in the latter direction have not been very successful . The latest writer on the subject objects , with considerable severity , to the classical nomenclature “ hardly pressed and barbarously misapplied . ” Our current prosody , he says later , “ ignores ” the frequent occurrence of an accented syllable at the beginning of a line of Shakspere 's verse , “ turning it off with the statement that ‘ a trochaic foot may begin an iambic verse . ’ ” Yet when we reach the summary of the author 's discussion of the subject , we find the same phenomenon “ turned off ” with this statement : “ In rising rhythm a thought-moment may begin with a falling wave-group . ” One cannot avoid querying whether this interesting combination of words conveys any simpler and better idea to the normal English reader than the familiar statement that “ a trochaic foot may begin an iambic verse . ” The case is instructive as to the danger of attempting a new terminology where one is already established , and of imagining that one has thereby made the discussion of the subject more scientific .</p>
   <p>The second of the objections to the usual terminology , that there is no real foot in English verse , has already been considered . If there are no regular units of measure in our verse , then to attempt constantly to find such units , and to use terms that imply their existence , is certainly a mistake . But those are on the wrong track who would find the divisions of the verse in the natural phrase-divisions of English speech .<span type="note_anchor">[ 55 ]</span>In “ arma virumque cano ” the syllable vi - is far more closely connected with the syllable - rum , for all prose purposes , than with the preceding syllables ; but in the verse the Romans thought of it as being in the same foot with arma ; and later in the verse the last syllable of cano is rhythmically connected ( over the barrier of a comma ) with the first of Trojæ . Indeed , the Latin poets instinctively avoided the regular coincidence of metrical units with word or sentence units . Precisely the same thing is true of English verse . It has been suggested more than once that the great preponderance , among English dissyllables , of those accented on the first syllable , goes to explain our preference for iambic over trochaic measures ; and that one reason why the rhythm of Hiawatha , for example , so soon wearies the ear , is because its metrical divisions and word divisions so frequently coincide . The fundamental principle of verse is that it sets up a new order of progress which constantly conflicts with , yet without destroying , the order of progress of common prose speech .</p>
   <p>So the foot means , not a unit of measure for the words , but for the syllables viewed as rhythmical sound ; and the attempt has already been made to show that it represents the time-interval between the regularly recurring accents of the normal metre . When there are two syllables in the interval , it is convenient to call the foot an iambus , a trochee , a pyrrhic , or a spondee ; when there are three , it is convenient to call the foot an anapest or a dactyl . According to this system , the number of feet in the metre will always depend on the number of regularly recurring accents , which of course is not the case in classical prosody . For the same reason , all exceptional feet can be named by one of the six terms indicated , except where ( as in Swinburne 's “ Choriambics ” ) some classical metre is deliberately imitated . There is no sufficient reason for speaking of the choriambus as occurring in Shakspere 's verse , because where four syllables occur in such succession as to form a sort of choriambus , they will be found to fill the place of two ordinary feet , not of one ; hence it would be irrational to combine them into one exceptional foot . But on this matter of convenience in the terminology of verse , one cannot do better than to refer the reader to Mr. Mayor 's Chapters on English Metre , where a refreshingly simple system is set forth , such as will not break down under any reasonable test .</p>
   <p>There is one defect , it may be freely admitted , in these classical names of feet . They provide no place for the secondary accent . A foot made up of a fully accented plus a slightly accented syllable must be called either a spondee ( the second syllable being thought of as approaching the stress of the first ) or a trochee ( the syllable being thought of as approaching no stress ) . The abundant use of secondary or compromised accents — and one might say , too , of secondary or compromised quantities — is a Germanic characteristic , for which no classical terminology can provide . There is , theoretically , room for some new names of feet recognizing these ambiguous syllables . Yet since degrees of accent are purely relative , and no two readers would be sure of agreeing as to which syllables are fully stressed , and which are half-stressed , it is not likely that such additional terms would make our terminology any more exact for practical purposes . The present system does , in fact , represent a characteristic feature of modern English as distinguished from early English verse ; namely , that our metres strive after a regular alternation of stress and no-stress , and that the ear imagines this alternation even where ( if it were a matter of prose utterance ) it can scarcely be said to exist .</p>
   <p>It would be absurd to strive with any warmth for the classical system of terminology in English prosody . It is undoubtedly not an ideal system , nor such a one as we should adopt if we were naming everything anew ; few existing terminologies are . The only object of the present defence of its carefully limited use is to show that it does stand for some fundamental facts in our verse , and to suggest that it is usually wiser to make the best of the vocabulary we have than to fly to one we know not of . The important thing , in any case , is not the question of terms , but the end that we should not lose hold of the musical rhythms of our verse , made up of delicately adjusted elements of accent and time .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 53 ]</span>See Mr. Larminie 's article on “ The Development of English Metres ” in the Contemporary Review for November , 1894 . In this article there is one of the clearest statements of the place of quantity in our verse that one can easily find . Mr. Larminie seems disposed , however , to place too much stress on the element of fixed or natural quantity , and sometimes to use the terms “ long ” and “ short ” with merely traditional meanings . The most characteristic feature of his discussion is , that he establishes certain principles of quantity , and judges the poets by their conformity to these principles . The inductive method is less pretentious and perhaps safer : to inquire what the poets do , and how in the reading of their verse we may preserve the rhythm which they undoubtedly had in mind . Both methods are legitimate . One will lay down rules for the poet , another for the reader ; and there is perhaps as much chance of one being followed as of the other .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>At least no difficulty has generally been found ; but Mr. Liddell marks the word as one which must be stressed from its grammatical importance . He even finds Coleridge untrue to the metre in putting where in an unstressed place in the verse , on the ground that it means “ through which . ” It would perhaps be safe to guess that no unsophisticated English reader has ever found difficulty in the accents of the line in question . The matter is worthy of remark as illustrating the tendency of one class of readers to emphasize sense-reading at the expense of rhythm . On the other hand , for an illustration of the opposite extreme see Professor Bright 's article on “ Grammatical Ictus in English Verse , ” in the Furnivall Miscellany ( 1901 ) , where we are told , in effect , that the metrical accent must always triumph over the sense-accent . As usual , the truth seems to lie somewhere between the extremes .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 55 ]</span>This seems to be a part of the old effort to seek a grammatical rather than a musical origin for metre . On this subject the reader should see the brilliant discussion of Professor Gummere in The Beginnings of Poetry , from which a few paragraphs are quoted in Part Four .</p>
   <p>PART FOUR</p>
   <p>THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY</p>
   <p>The following extracts from important critical discussions are selected with reference to their bearing on two questions : Is metre an essential or only an incidental element of poetry ? and , What are its functions in the total content and effect of poetry ? The student of the subject will do well to analyze the answers to the second question , determining under how many aspects of the metrical element they can be grouped .</p>
   <p>Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes , each of them lying deep in our nature . First , the instinct of imitation is implanted in man from childhood .... Next , there is the instinct for harmony and rhythm , metres being manifestly sections of rhythm . Persons , therefore , starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes , till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry .</p>
   <p>( ARISTOTLE : Poetics , iv . Butcher 's translation , pp . 15 , 17 . )</p>
   <p>Poetry , music , and dancing constitute in Aristotle a group by themselves , their common element being imitation by means of rhythm — rhythm which admits of being applied to words , sounds , and the movements of the body . The history of these arts bears out the views we find expressed in Greek writers upon the theory of music ; it is a witness to the primitive unity of music and poetry , and to the close alliance of the two with dancing .... The intimate fusion of the three arts afterward known as the “ musical ” arts — or rather we should perhaps say , the alliance of music and dancing under the supremacy of poetry — was exhibited even in the person of the artist . The office of the poet as teacher of the chorus demanded a practical knowledge of all that passed under the term “ dancing , ” including steps , gestures , attitudes , and the varied resources of rhythmical movement .... The poet , lyric or dramatic , composed the accompaniment as well as wrote the verses ; and it was made a reproach against Euripides , who was the first to deviate from the established usage , that he sought the aid of Iophon , son of Sophocles , in the musical setting of his dramas . The very word “ poet ” in classical times often implies the twofold character of poet and musician , and in later writers is sometimes used , like our “ composer , ” in a strictly limited reference to music .</p>
   <p>Aristotle does full justice to the force of rhythmic form and movement in the arts of music and dancing . The instinctive love of melody and rhythm is , again , one of the two causes to which he traces the origin of poetry , but he lays little stress on this element in estimating the finished products of the poetic art . In the Rhetoric he observes that if a sentence has metre it will be poetry ; but this is said in a popular way . It was doubtless the received opinion , but it is one which he twice combats in the Poetics , insisting that it is not metrical form that makes a poem ....</p>
   <p>The general question whether metre is necessary for poetical expression has been raised by many modern critics and poets , and has sometimes been answered in the negative , as by Sidney , Shelley , Wordsworth . It is , however , worth observing that from Aristotle 's point of view , which was mainly one of observation , the question to be determined was rather as to the vehicle or medium of literary mimesis ; and so far as the mimesis doctrine is concerned , it is undeniable that some kinds of imaginative subject-matter are better expressed in prose , some in verse , and that Aristotle , who had before him experimental examples of writings poetic in spirit , but not metrical in form , had sufficient grounds for advocating an extension of meaning for the term poietes . But as regards the Art of Poetry , his reasoning does not lead us to conclude that he would have reckoned the authors of prose dialogues or romances among poets strictly so called . As Mr. Courthope truly says , “ he does not attempt to prove that metre is not a necessary accompaniment of the higher conceptions of poetry , ” and he , “ therefore , cannot be ranged with those who support that extreme opinion . ” Still there would appear to be some want of firmness in the position he takes up as to the place and importance of metre . In his definition of tragedy ( chap . vi . 2 ) “ embellished language ” is included among the constituent elements of tragedy ; and the phrase is then explained to mean language that has the twofold charm of metre ( which is a branch of rhythm ) and of melody . But these elements are placed in a subordinate rank and are hardly treated as essentials . They are in this respect not unlike scenery or spectacular effect , which , though deduced by Aristotle from the definition , is not explicitly mentioned in it . The essence of the poetry is the “ imitation ” ; the melody and the verse are the “ seasoning ” of the language .... Aristotle , highly as he rates the æsthetic capacity of the sense of hearing in his treatment of music , says nothing to show that he values at its proper worth the power of rhythmical sound as factor in poetry ; and this is the more striking in a Greek , whose enjoyment of poetry came through the ear rather than the eye , and for whom poetry was so largely associated with music . After all , there can hardly be a greater difference between two ways of saying the same thing than that one is said in verse , the other in prose . There are some lyrics which have lived and will always live by their musical charm , and by a strange magic that lies in the setting of the words . We need not agree with a certain modern school who would empty all poetry of poetical thought and etherealize it till it melts into a strain of music ; who sing to us we hardly know of what , but in such a way that the echoes of the real world , its men and women , its actual stir and conflict , are faint and hardly to be discerned . The poetry , we are told , resides not in the ideas conveyed , not in the blending of soul and sense , but in the sound itself , in the cadence of the verse . Yet , false as this view may be , it is not perhaps more false than that other which wholly ignores the effect of musical sound and looks only to the thought that is conveyed . Aristotle comes perilously near this doctrine .</p>
   <p>( S. H. BUTCHER : Aristotle 's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art . pp . 138-147 . )</p>
   <p>It is not riming and versing that maketh a poet , no more than a long gown maketh an advocate ; who , though he pleaded in armor , should be an advocate and no soldier . But it is that feigning notable images of virtues , vices , or what else , with that delightful teaching which must be the right describing note to know a poet by ; although , indeed , the senate of poets hath chosen verse as their fittest raiment , meaning , as in matter they passed all in all , so in manner to go beyond them : not speaking ( table-talk fashion , or like men in a dream ) words as they chanceably fell from the mouth , but poyzing each syllable of each word by just proportion according to the dignity of the subject ....</p>
   <p>It is already said ( and as I think , truly said ) it is not riming and versing that maketh poesy .... But yet , presuppose it were inseparable ( as , indeed , it seemeth Scaliger judgeth ) truly it were an inseparable commendation . For if oratio next to ratio , speech next to reason , be the greatest gift bestowed upon mortality , that cannot be praiseless , which doth most polish that blessing of speech , which considers each word , not only ( as a man may say ) by his forcible quality , but by his measured quantity , carrying even in themselves a harmony , without ( perchance ) number , measure , order , proportion , be in our time grown odious . But lay aside the just praise it hath , by being the only fit speech for music ( music , I say , the most divine striker of the senses ) ; thus much is undoubtedly true , that if reading be foolish , without remembering , memory being the only treasurer of knowledge , those words which are fittest for memory are likewise most convenient for knowledge . Now , that verse far exceedeth prose in the knitting up of the memory , the reason is manifest . The words ( besides their delight , which hath a great affinity to memory ) , being so set , as one word cannot be lost , but the whole work fails , which accuseth itself , calleth the remembrance back to itself , and so most strongly confirmeth it . Besides , one word so as it were begetting another , as be it in rime or measured verse , by the former a man shall have a near guess to the follower .... So that , verse being in itself sweet and orderly , and being best for memory , the only handle of knowledge , it must be in jest that any man can speak against it .</p>
   <p>( SIR PHILIP SIDNEY : An Apologie for Poetrie . )</p>
   <p>Versification , or the art of modulating his numbers , is indispensably necessary to a poet . Every other power by which the understanding is enlightened , or the imagination enchanted , may be exercised in prose . But the poet has this peculiar superiority , that to all the powers which the perfection of every other composition can require , he adds the faculty of joining music with reason , and of acting at once upon the senses and the passions . I suppose there are few who do not feel themselves touched by poetical melody , and who will not confess that they are more or less moved by the same thoughts , as they are conveyed by different sounds , and more affected by the same words in one order than another . The perception of harmony is , indeed , conferred upon men in degrees very unequal ; but there are none who do not perceive it , or to whom a regular series of proportionate sounds cannot give delight .</p>
   <p>( SAMUEL JOHNSON : The Rambler , No . 86 . )</p>
   <p>Various causes might be pointed out why , when the style is manly , and the subject of some importance , words metrically arranged will long continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who proves the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart . The end of poetry is to produce excitement in coexistence with an overbalance of pleasure ; but , by the supposition , excitement is an unusual and irregular state of the mind ; ideas and feelings do not , in that state , succeed each other in accustomed order .... Now the co-presence of something regular , something to which the mind has been accustomed in various moods and in a less excited state , cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling , and of feeling not strictly and necessarily connected with the passion . This is unquestionably true ; and hence , though the opinion will at first appear paradoxical , from the tendency of metre to divest language , in a certain degree , of its reality , and thus to throw a sort of half-consciousness of unsubstantial existence over the whole composition , there can be little doubt but that more pathetic situations and sentiments — that is , those which have a greater proportion of pain connected with them — may be endured in metrical composition , especially in rime , than in prose .... This opinion may be further illustrated by appealing to the reader 's own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the reperusal of the distressful parts of Clarissa Harlowe , or the Gamester ; while Shakspere 's writings , in the most pathetic scenes , never act upon us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasure — an effect which , in a much greater degree than might at first be imagined , is to be ascribed to small , but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical arrangement .<span type="note_anchor">[ 56 ]</span>On the other hand ( what it must be allowed will much more frequently happen ) , if the poet 's words should be incommensurate with the passion , and inadequate to raise the reader to a height of desirable excitement , then ( unless the poet 's choice of his metre has been grossly injudicious ) , in the feelings of pleasure which the reader has been accustomed to connect with metre in general , and in the feeling , whether cheerful or melancholy , which he has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre , there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart passion to the words , and to effect the complex end which the poet proposes to himself .</p>
   <p>If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory here maintained , it would have been my duty to develop the various causes upon which the pleasure received from metrical language depends . Among the chief of these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of the Arts the object of accurate reflection ; namely , the pleasure which the mind derives from the perception of similitude in dissimilitude . This principle is the great spring of the activity of our minds , and their chief feeder .... It would not be a useless employment to apply this principle to the consideration of metre , and to show that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure , and to point out in what manner that pleasure is produced . But my limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject , and I must content myself with a general summary .</p>
   <p>I have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings ; it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity ; the emotion is contemplated till , by a species of reaction , the tranquillity gradually disappears , and an emotion , kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation , is gradually produced , and does itself actually exist in the mind . In this mood successful composition generally begins , and in a mood similar to this it is carried on ; but the emotion , of whatever kind , and in whatever degree , from various causes , is qualified by various pleasures , so that in describing any passions whatsoever , which are voluntarily described , the mind will , upon the whole , be in a state of enjoyment . If Nature be thus cautious to preserve in a state of enjoyment a being so employed , the Poet ought to profit by the lesson held forth to him , and ought especially to take care that , whatever passions he communicates to his reader , those passions , if his reader 's mind be sound and vigorous , should always be accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure . Now the music of harmonious metrical language , the sense of difficulty overcome , and the blind association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of rime or metre of the same or similar construction , an indistinct perception perpetually renewed of language closely resembling that of real life , and yet , in the circumstance of metre , differing from it so widely — all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight , which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling always found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper passions . This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned poetry ; while , in lighter compositions , the ease and gracefulness with which the Poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the reader . All that it is necessary to say , however , upon this subject , may be effected by affirming , what few persons will deny , that of two descriptions , either of passions , manners , or characters , each of them equally well executed , the one in prose and the other in verse , the verse will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once .</p>
   <p>( WORDSWORTH : Preface to the Lyrical Ballads , 2d ed . )</p>
   <p>The true question must be ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 57 ]</span>whether there are not modes of expression , a construction , and an order of sentences , which are in their fit and natural place in a serious prose composition , but would be disproportionate and heterogeneous in metrical poetry ; and , vice versa , whether in the language of a serious poem there may not be an arrangement both of words and sentences , and a use and selection of ( what are called ) figures of speech , both as to their kind , their frequency , and their occasions , which on a subject of equal weight would be vicious and alien in correct and manly prose . I contend that in both cases this unfitness of each for the place of the other frequently will and ought to exist . And , first , from the origin of metre . This I would trace to the balance in the mind effected by the spontaneous effort which strives to hold in check the workings of passion . It might be easily explained likewise in what manner this salutary antagonism is assisted by the very state which it counteracts ; and how this balance of antagonists became organized into metre ( in the usual acceptation of that term ) by a supervening act of the will and judgment , consciously and for the foreseen purpose of pleasure . Assuming these principles as the data of our argument , we deduce from them two legitimate conditions , which the critic is entitled to expect in every metrical work . First , that as the elements of metre owe their existence to a state of increased excitement , so the metre itself should be accompanied by the natural language of excitement . Secondly , that as these elements are formed into metre artificially , by a voluntary act , with the design and for the purpose of blending delight with emotion , so the traces of present volition should throughout the metrical language be proportionally discernible ....</p>
   <p>Secondly , I argue from the effects of metre . As far as metre acts in and for itself , it tends to increase the vivacity and susceptibility both of the general feelings and of the attention . This effect it produces by the continued excitement of surprise , and by the quick reciprocations of curiosity still gratified and still re-excited , which are too slight indeed to be at any moment objects of distinct consciousness , yet become considerable in their aggregate influence . As a medicated atmosphere , or as wine during animated conversation , they act powerfully , though themselves unnoticed . Where , therefore , correspondent food and appropriate matter are not provided for the attention and feelings thus roused , there must needs be disappointment felt ;— like that of leaping in the dark from the last step of a staircase , when we had prepared our muscles for a leap of three or four .</p>
   <p>The discussion on the powers of metre , in the Preface , is highly ingenious , and touches at all points on truth . But I cannot find any statement of its powers considered abstractly and separately . On the contrary , Mr. Wordsworth seems always to estimate metre by the powers which it exerts during ( and , as I think , in consequence of ) its combination with other elements of poetry . Thus the previous difficulty is left unanswered , what the elements are with which it must be combined in order to produce its own effects to any pleasurable purpose .... For any poetic purposes , metre resembles ( if the aptness of the simile may excuse its meanness ) yeast , worthless or disagreeable by itself , but giving vivacity and spirit to the liquor with which it is proportionally combined ....</p>
   <p>Metre in itself is simply a stimulant of the attention , and therefore excites the question , Why is the attention to be thus stimulated ? Now the question cannot be answered by the pleasure of the metre itself ; for this we have shown to be conditional , and dependent on the appropriateness of the thoughts and expressions to which the metrical form is superadded . Neither can I conceive any other answer that can be rationally given , short of this : I write in metre , because I am about to use a language different from that of prose ....</p>
   <p>Thirdly , I deduce the position from all the causes elsewhere assigned which render metre the proper form of poetry , and poetry imperfect and defective without metre . Metre , therefore , having been connected with poetry most often , and by a peculiar fitness , whatever else is combined with metre must , though it be not itself essentially poetic , have nevertheless some property in common with poetry , as an intermedium of affinity .</p>
   <p>( COLERIDGE : Biographia Literaria , chap . xviii . )</p>
   <p>In the youth of the world , men dance and sing and imitate natural objects , observing in these actions , as in all others , a certain rhythm or order . And , although all men observe a similar , they observe not the same order , in the motions of the dance , in the melody of the song , in the combinations of language , in the series of their imitations of natural objects . For there is a certain order or rhythm belonging to each of these classes of mimetic representation , from which the hearer and the spectator receive an intenser and purer pleasure than from any other : the sense of an approximation to this order has been called taste by modern writers ....</p>
   <p>Language , color , form , and religious and civil habits of action are all the instruments and materials of poetry ; and they may be called poetry by that figure of speech which considers the effect as a synonym of the cause . But poetry in a more restricted sense expresses those arrangements of language , and especially metrical language , which are created by that imperial faculty whose throne is curtained within the invisible nature of man . And this springs from the nature itself of language , which is a more direct representation of the actions and passions of our internal being , and is susceptible of more various and delicate combinations than color , form , or motion , and is more plastic and obedient to the control of that faculty of which it is the creation .... Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both between each other and towards that which they represent , and a perception of the order of those relations has always been found connected with a perception of the order of the relations of thoughts . Hence the language of poets has ever affected a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence of sound , without which it were not poetry , and which is scarcely less indispensable to the communication of its influence than the words themselves , without reference to that peculiar order .... An observation of the regular mode of the recurrence of harmony in the language of poetical minds , together with its relation to music , produced metre , or a certain system of traditional forms of harmony and language . Yet it is by no means essential that a poet should accommodate his language to this traditional form , so that the harmony , which is its spirit , be observed .</p>
   <p>( SHELLEY : A Defence of Poetry . )</p>
   <p>Poetry , in its matter and form , is natural imagery or feeling , combined with passion and fancy . In its mode of conveyance , it combines the ordinary use of language with musical expression . There is a question of long standing in what the essence of poetry consists , or what it is that determines why one set of ideas should be expressed in prose , another in verse . Milton has told us his idea of poetry in a single line :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thoughts that voluntary move</l>
     <l n="2">Harmonious numbers . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As there are certain sounds that excite certain movements , and the song and dance go together , so there are , no doubt , certain thoughts that lead to certain tones of voice , or modulations of sound , and change “ the words of Mercury into the songs of Apollo . ” ... The jerks , the breaks , the inequalities and harshnesses of prose are fatal to the flow of a poetical imagination , as a jolting road or a stumbling horse disturbs the reverie of an absent man . But poetry “ makes these odds all even . ” It is the music of language , answering to the music of the mind , untying , as it were , “ the secret soul of harmony . ” Wherever any object takes such a hold of the mind as to make us dwell upon it , and brood over it , melting the heart in tenderness , or kindling it to a sentiment of enthusiasm ; wherever a movement of imagination or passion is impressed on the mind , by which it seeks to prolong and repeat the emotion , to bring all other objects into accord with it , and to give the same movement of harmony , sustained and continuous , or gradually varied , according to the occasion , to the sounds that express it — this is poetry . The musical in sound is the sustained and continuous ; the musical in thought is the sustained and continuous also . There is a near connection between music and deep-rooted passion . Mad people sing . As often as articulation passes naturally into intonation , there poetry begins .... It is to supply the inherent defect of harmony in the customary mechanism of language , to make the sound an echo to the sense , when the sense becomes a sort of echo to itself — to mingle the tide of verse , “ the golden cadences of poetry , ” with the tide of feeling , flowing and murmuring as it flows — in short , to take the language of the imagination from off the ground ; and enable it to spread its wings where it may indulge its own impulses :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Sailing with supreme dominion</l>
     <l n="2">Through the azure deep of air , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>without being stopped , or fretted , or diverted with the abruptnesses and petty obstacles , and discordant flats and sharps of prose , that poetry was invented . It is to common language what springs are to a carriage , or wings to feet . In ordinary speech we arrive at a certain harmony by the modulations of the voice ; in poetry the same thing is done systematically by a regular collocation of syllables . It has been well observed , that every one who declaims warmly , or grows intent upon a subject , rises into a sort of blank verse or measured prose .... An excuse might be made for rime in the same manner . It is but fair that the ear should linger on the sounds that delight it , or avail itself of the same brilliant coincidence and unexpected recurrence of syllables , that have been displayed in the invention and collocation of images . It is allowed that rime assists the memory .... But if the jingle of names assists the memory , may it not also quicken the fancy ?</p>
   <p>( WILLIAM HAZLITT : On Poetry in General . )</p>
   <p>With regard to the principle of Variety in Uniformity by which verses ought to be modulated , and oneness of impression diversely produced , it has been contended by some that poetry need not be written in verse at all ; that prose is as good a medium , provided poetry be conveyed through it , and that to think otherwise is to confound letter with spirit , or form with essence . But the opinion is a prosaical mistake . Fitness and unfitness for song , or metrical excitement , just make all the difference between a poetical and prosaical subject ; and the reason why verse is necessary to the form of poetry is that the perfection of poetical spirit demands it — that the circle of its enthusiasm , beauty , and power is incomplete without it . I do not mean that a poet can never show himself a poet in prose ; but that being one , his desire and necessity will be to write in verse ; and that , if he were unable to do so , he would not and could not deserve his title . Verse to the true poet is no clog . It is idly called a trammel and a difficulty . It is a help . It springs from the same enthusiasm as the rest of his impulses , and is necessary to their satisfaction and effect .... Verse is the final proof to the poet that his mastery over his art is complete . It is the shutting up of his powers in “ measureful content ” ; the answer of form to his spirit ; of strength and ease to his guidance .... Verse , in short , is that finishing , and rounding , and “ tuneful planeting ” of the poet 's creations which is produced of necessity by the smooth tendencies of their energy or inward working , and the harmonious dance into which they are attracted round the orb of the beautiful . Poetry , in its complete sympathy with beauty , must of necessity leave no sense of the beautiful , and no power over its forms , unmanifested ; and verse flows as inevitably from this condition of its integrity as other laws of proportion do from any other kind of embodiment of beauty ....</p>
   <p>Every poet , then , is a versifier ; every fine poet an excellent one ; and he is the best whose verse exhibits the greatest amount of strength , sweetness , straightforwardness , unsuperfluousness , variety , and oneness ;— oneness , that is to say , consistency in the general impression , metrical and moral ; and variety , or every pertinent diversity of tone and rhythm , in the process .... It is thus that versification itself becomes part of the sentiment of a poem , and vindicates the pains that have been taken to show its importance . I know of no very fine versification unaccompanied with fine poetry ; no poetry of a mean order accompanied with verse of the highest .</p>
   <p>( LEIGH HUNT : What is Poetry ? Cook ed ., pp . 37-40 , 61 . )</p>
   <p>No literary expression can , properly speaking , be called poetry that is not in a certain deep sense emotional , whatever may be its subject-matter , concrete in its method and its diction , rhythmical in movement , and artistic in form .... That poetry must be metrical or even rhythmical in movement , however , is what some have denied . Here we touch at once the very root of the subject .... While prose requires intellectual life and emotional life , poetry seems to require not only intellectual life and emotional life but rhythmic life .... Unless the rhythm of any metrical passage is so vigorous , so natural , and so free that it seems as though it could live , if need were , by its rhythm alone , has that passage any right to exist ? and should it not , if the substance is good , be forthwith demetricized and turned into prose ? ... Aristotle ignored , and Plato slighted , the importance of versification ( though Plato on one occasion admitted that he who did not know rhythm could be called neither musician nor poet ) .... On the whole , however , the theory that versification is not an indispensable requisite of a poem seems to have become nearly obsolete in our time . Perhaps , indeed , many critics would now go so far in the contrary direction as to say with Hegel ( Æsthetik , iii . p. 289 ) that “ metre is the first and only condition absolutely demanded by poetry , yea even more necessary than a figurative picturesque diction . ”</p>
   <p>( THEODORE WATTS : Article on “ Poetry ” in Encyclopædia Britannica . )</p>
   <p>Verse-rhythm in words is the imposition of a sensible order on what naturally and normally has only a logical order ; and there is piquancy in the feeling that so little is this ideal control a fettering instrument , that each order seems to gain verve and spontaneity from the other , or rather from the latent sense that the other , though present and operative , is powerless to hamper it . Much more important , however , is it to notice how the sense that one single thing — the word-series — is lending itself to this joint dominance may take the form of a sort of transfigured surprise . ( The root-principle here involved is the old one of “ unity in variety , ” the single line of words , “ dominated at once by the idea which they express in their grammatical connection and by their metrical adjustment , ” clearly possessing two independent functions or aspects . See the fuller discussion of “ The Sound-element in Verse , ” in chapter xix . of The Power of Sound . ) ... When , as in verse , the sounds are pointedly addressed both to the ear and to the understanding , the rarity of the combination of aspects contributes a strain of feeling partly akin to that with which we follow an exhibition of skill , and partly to that with which we receive an unexpected gratuity ....</p>
   <p>Nor is this all . Rhythm perpetually not only transfigures the poetical expression of an idea , but makes the existence of that expression possible . This is tolerably obvious in the case of what is often called par excellence poetical language — language which keeps clear of prosaic homeliness and prosaic precision and of technical and abstract terms , and confines itself to a more picturesque and loftier vocabulary .... Clearly it is the rarity of rhythmic , as compared with non-rhythmic , speech that supports such rarity of poetic as compared with non-poetic diction ; that is to say , verse , being in one respect — namely , its effect on the ear — a marked exception from ordinary language , thereby establishes for itself the means of being exceptional , without seeming unnatural , in other ways ....</p>
   <p>... In dwelling on the non-reasonable part in poetical beauty , I am in no way committed to the assertion that all its constituents are excluded from prose , but only to the assertion that the metrical form makes a difference of kind . It cannot be for nothing that the very idea of “ poetical prose ” inspires dread ; and the instances of prose-writing where we find delight of the intangible and non-reasonable kind are exceptions that only prove the rule . One has but to test by self-examination the living force of words in a specimen of verse and of poetical prose which may respectively seem to oneself first-rate of their kind . For such typical passages may often be regarded as fairly on a par in respect of the ideas and emotions which they reasonably express ; and the prose may unquestionably further resemble the poetry in a certain subtle individuality of life in its more prominent words , so far as this life can be quickened in them by the idea itself , aided by such qualities of sound-arrangement as are possible apart from metre . So far the poetical merits of the respective passages may be equal ; yet only one of them is Poetry .... Language , which in prose does little more than transmit thought , like clear glass , becomes — even as that becomes — by art 's adjustments and the moulding of measured form , a lens , where the thought takes fire as it passes . The poet speaks through a medium which seems to intensify the point and to extend the range of what he would tell us by some power outside his own volition . Such a power , in fact , a rhythmic order , in its fundamental appeal to human nerves , literally is .... The ictus of the verse comes upon us as the operative force which shocks the words into their unwonted life .</p>
   <p>... In considering the total contribution of metre to imaginative language , it is impossible to overlook the quality of permanence . I do not mean permanence merely in the sense that metrical words live in the memory .... This is , of course , a most important fact ; but I am here dealing only with elements of effect that enter into the actual moment of enjoyment .... It is a sense of combined parts , and their indispensableness one to another , which gives us a sense of permanence in an arch as compared with a casual heap of stones ; it is a similar indispensableness which gives to metrical language an air of permanence impossible even to the most harmonious sentence whose sounds conform to no genuine scheme . And again , in the case of this constituent as of the others , we have no difficulty in seeing that its influence is really a joint one of sound and sense — that , though founded in the nature of metrical sound as such , it is not merely a sound-quality superposed ab extra on the intelligible beauty of the words , but depends for its existence on their intelligible character .... We cannot glory in the enshrining for memory of things that we do not care to remember . But for that which is of true spiritual significance the fairly-fitted body of sound is greeted as the inevitable investiture ; and thus justified and quickened , the strength of the mutually indispensable parts seems no longer that of mere structure but of organic life .</p>

   <p>Why have poets always written in metre ? The answer is , Because the laws of artistic expression oblige them to do so . When the poet has been inspired from without in the way in which we saw Scott was inspired to conceive the Lay of the Last Minstrel — that is to say , when he has found his subject-matter in an idea , universally striking to the imagination , when he has received this into his own imagination , and has given it a new and beautiful form of life there , then he will seek to express his conception through a vehicle of language harmonizing with his own feelings and the nature of the subject , and this kind of language is called verse . For example , when Marlowe wishes to represent the emotions of Faustus , after he has called up the phantom of Helen of Troy , it is plain that some very rapturous form of expression is needed to convey an adequate idea of such famous beauty . Marlowe rises to the occasion in those “ mighty lines ” of his :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Was this the face that launched a thousand ships ,</l>
     <l n="2">And burned the topless towers of Ilium ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But it is certain that he could only have ventured on the sublime audacity of saying that a face launched ships and burned towers by escaping from the limits of ordinary language , and conveying his metaphor through the harmonious and ecstatic movements of rhythm and metre ....</p>
   <p>I think Wordsworth 's analysis of emotion is clearly wrong . The reason why the harrowing descriptions of Richardson are simply painful , while Shakspere 's tragic situations are pleasurable , is that the imagination shrinks from dwelling on ideas so closely imitated from real objects as the scenes in Clarissa Harlowe , but contemplates without excess of pain the situation in Othello , for example , because the imitation is poetical and ideal . Prose is used by Richardson because his novel professedly resembles a situation of real life ; metre is needed by Shakspere to make the ideal life of his drama real to the imagination . Wordsworth , if I may say so , has put the poetical cart before the horse ....</p>
   <p>The propriety of poetical expression is the test and the touch-stone of the justice of poetical conception .... Poetry lies in the invention of the right metrical form — be it epic , dramatic , lyric , or satiric — for the expression of some idea universally interesting to the imagination . When the form of metrical expression seems natural — natural , that is , to the genius of the poet and the inherent character of the subject — then the subject-matter will have been rightly conceived .... Apply this test of what is natural in metrical expression to any composition claiming to be poetically inspired , and you will be able to decide whether it fulfils the universal conditions of poetical life , or whether it is one of those phantoms , or , as Bacon calls them , idols of the imagination , which vanish as soon as the novelty of their appearance has exhausted its effect . For instance , the American poet , Walt Whitman , announces his theme , and asks for the sympathy of the reader in these words :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Oneself I sing , a simple , separate person ,</l>
     <l n="2">Yet utter the word Democratic , the word En Masse .</l>
     <l n="3">Poets to come , orators , singers , musicians to come ,</l>
     <l n="4">Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for ,</l>
     <l n="5">But you , a new brood , native , athletic , continental , greater than</l>
     <l n="6">before known ,</l>
     <l n="7">Arouse ! for you must justify me !... ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To this appeal I think the reader may reply : The subject you have chosen is certainly an idol of the imagination . For if you had anything of universal interest to say about yourself , you could say it in a way natural to one of the metres , or metrical movements , established in the English language . What you call metre bears precisely the same relation to these universal laws of expression , as the Mormon church and the religion of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young bear to the doctrines of Catholic Christendom .<span type="note_anchor">[ 58 ]</span>...</p>
   <p>Why do we so often find men in these days , either using metre ... where they ought to have expressed themselves in prose , or expressing themselves in verse in a style so far remote from the standard of diction established in society that they fail to touch the heart ? I think the explanation of this curious phenomenon is that , though metre can only properly be used for the expression of universal ideas , there is in modern society an eccentric or monastic principle at work , which leads men to pervert metre into a luxurious instrument for the expression of merely private ideas .</p>
   <p>( WILLIAM JOHN COURTHOPE : Life in Poetry , Law in Taste , pp . 71-83 . )</p>
   <p>Language is colloquial and declarative in our ordinary speech , and on its legs for common use and movement . Only when it takes wings does it become poetry . As the poet , touched by emotion , rises to enthusiasm and imaginative power or skill , his speech grows rhythmic , and thus puts on the attribute that distinguishes it from every other mode of artistic expression — the guild-mark which , rightly considered , establishes the nature of the thing itself .... Our new empiricism , following where intuition leads the way , comprehends the function of vibrations : it perceives that every movement of matter , seized upon by universal force , is vibratory ; that vibrations , and nothing else , convey through the body the look and voice of nature to the soul ; that thus alone can one incarnate individuality address its fellow ; that , to use old Bunyan 's imagery , these vibrations knock at the ear-gate , and are visible to the eye-gate , and are sentient at the gates of touch of the living temple . The word describing their action is in evidence ; they “ thrill ” the body , they thrill the soul , both of which respond with subjective , interblending vibrations , according to the keys , the wave-lengths , of their excitants . Thus it is absolutely true that what Buxton Forman calls “ idealized language , ” — that is , speech which is imaginative and rhythmical ,— goes with emotional thought ; and that words exert a mysterious and potent influence , thus chosen and assorted , beyond their normal meanings ....</p>
   <p>Aside from the vibratory mission of rhythm , its little staff of adjuvants , by the very discipline and limitations which they impose , take poetry out of the plane of common speech , and make it an art which lifts the hearer to its own unusual key . Schiller writes to Goethe that “ rhythm , in a dramatic work , treats all characters and all situations according to one law .... In this manner it forms the atmosphere for the poetic creation . The more material part is left out , for only what is spiritual can be borne by this thin element . ” In real , that is , spontaneous minstrelsy , the fittest assonance , consonance , time , even rime , ... come of themselves with the imaginative thought .... Such is the test of genuineness , the underlying principle being that the masterful words of all poetic tongues are for the most part in both their open and consonantal sounds related to their meanings , so that with the inarticulate rhythm of impassioned thought we have a correspondent verbal rhythm for its vehicle . The whole range of poetry which is vital , from the Hebrew psalms and prophecies , in their original text and in our great English version , to the Georgian lyrics and romances and the Victorian idyls , confirms the statement of Mill that “ the deeper the feeling , the more characteristic and decided the rhythm . ” The rapture of the poet governs the tone and accent of his</p>
   <p>“ high and passionate thoughts To their own music chanted . ”</p>
   <p>( EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN : The Nature and Elements of Poetry , pp . 51-55 . )</p>
   <p>We agree , then , to call by the name of poetry that form of art which uses rhythm to attain its ends , just as we call by the name of flying that motion which certain animals attain by the use of wings ; that the feelings roused by poetry can be roused by unrhythmic order of words , and that rhythmic order of words is often deplorably bad art , or “ unpoetic , ” have as little to do with the case as the fact that a greyhound speeding over the grass gives the spectator quite the exhilaration and sense of lightness and grace which is roused by the flight of a bird , and the fact that an awkward fowl makes itself ridiculous in trying to fly , have to do with the general proposition that flying is a matter of wings .... As a matter of fact , all writers on poetry take rhythm for granted until some one asks why it is necessary ; whereupon considerable discussion , and the protest signed by a respectable minority , but a minority after all , that rhythm is not an essential condition of the poetic art . This discussion , as every one knows , has been lively and at times bitter . A patient and comprehensive review of it in a fairly impartial spirit has led to the conclusion , first , that no test save rhythm has been proposed which can be put to real use , even in theory , not to mention the long reaches of a historical and comparative study ; secondly , that all defenders of the poem in prose are more or less contradictory and inconsistent , making confusion between theory and practice ; and thirdly , that advocates of a rhythmic test , even in abstract definition , seem to have the better of the argument ....</p>
   <p>All reports of primitive singing , that is , of singing among races on a low plane of culture , make rhythm a wholly insistent element of the verse .... Rhythm is obscured or hidden by declamation only in times when the eye has usurped the functions of the ear , and when a highly developed prose makes the accented rhythm of poetry seem either old-fashioned or a sign of childhood . Not that one wishes to restore a sing-song reading , but rather a recognition of metrical structure , of those subtle effects in rhythm which mean so much in the poet 's art ; verse , in a word , particularly lyric verse , must not be read as if it were prose . Dramatic verse is a difficult problem .... For in drama one wishes nowadays to hear not rhythm , but the thought , the story , the point .... As thought recedes , as one comes nearer to those primitive emotions which were untroubled by thought , they get expression more and more in cadenced tones . And again , this cadenced emotional expression , as it grows stronger , grows wider ; the barriers of irony and reserve , which keep a modern theatre tearless in the face of Lear 's most pathetic utterance , break down ; first , as one recedes from modern conditions , comes the sympathetic emotion of the spectators expressed in sighs and tears ; ... then comes the partial activity of the spectators by their deputed chorus ; and at last the throng of primitive times , common emotion in common expression , with no spectators , no audience , no reserve or comment of thought ,— for thought is absorbed in the perception and action of communal consent ; and here , by all evidence , rhythm rules supreme ....</p>
   <p>If , now , the curve of evolution in Aryan verse begins with an absolutely strict rhythm and alternate emphasis of syllables , often , as in Iranian , to the neglect of logical considerations ; if the course of poetry is to admit logical considerations more and more , forcing in at least one case the abandoning of movable accent and the agreement of verse-emphasis with syllabic-emphasis , an undisputed fact ; if poetry , too , first shakes off the steps of dancing , then the notes of song , finally the strict scanning of the verse , until now recited poetry is triumphantly logical , with rhythm as a subconscious element ; if , finally , this process exactly agrees with the gradual increase of thought over emotion , with the analogous increase of solitary poetry over gregarious poetry ,— then , surely , one has but to trace back this curve of evolution , and to project it into prehistoric conditions , in order to infer with something very close to certitude that rhythm is the primal fact in the beginnings of the poetic art ....</p>
   <p>The hold of rhythm upon modern poetry , even under conditions of analytic and intellectual development which have unquestionably worked for the increased importance of prose , is a hold not to be relaxed , and for good reason . The reason is this . In rhythm , in sounds of the human voice , timed to movements of the human body , mankind first discovered that social consent which brought the great joys and the great pains of life into a common utterance .... The mere fact of utterance is social ; however solitary his thought , a poet 's utterance must voice this consent of man with man , and his emotion must fall into rhythm , the one and eternal expression of consent . This , then , is why rhythm will not be banished from poetry so long as poetry shall remain emotional utterance ; for rhythm is not only sign and warrant of a social contract stronger , deeper , vaster , than any fancied by Rousseau , but it is the expression of a human sense more keen even than the fear of devils and the love of gods — the sense and sympathy of kind .<span type="note_anchor">[ 59 ]</span></p>

But metre , rhythm , cadence , not merely appreciable but definable and reducible to rule and measurement , though we do not expect from you , we demand from all who claim , we discern in the works of all who have achieved , any place among poets of any class whatsoever .... The question is whether you have any more right to call yourself a poet , or to be called a poet , ... than to call yourself or to be called , on the strength of your published writings , a mathematician , a logician , a painter , a political economist , a sculptor , a dynamiter , an old parliamentary hand , a civil engineer , a dealer in marine stores , an amphimacer , a triptych , a rhomboid , or a rectangular parallelogram . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 59 ]</span>Professor Gummere also gives this analysis of Karl Bücher 's essay on “ Labor and Rhythm ” ( Arbeit und Rhythmus , Leipzig , 1896 ): “ Fatigue , which besets all work felt as work by reason of its continued application of purpose , vanished for primitive man , as it vanishes now for children , if the work was once freed from this stress of application and so turned to a kind of play . The dance itself is really hard work , exacting and violent ; what makes it the favorite it is with savages as with children ? Simply its automatic , regular , rhythmic character , the due repetition of a familiar movement which allows the mind to relax its attitude of constant purpose . The purpose and plan of work involve external sources and external ends ; rhythm is instinctive , and springs from the organic nature of man ; it is no invention . The song that one sings while at work is not something fitted to the work , but comes from movements of the body in the specific acts of labor ; and this applies not only to the rhythm , but even to the words . So it was in the festal dance .... That poetry and music were always combined by early man , and , along with labor , made up the primitive three-in-one , an organic whole , labor being the basal fact , with rhythm as an element common to the three ; and that not harmony or pitch , but this overmastering and pervasive rhythm , exact , definite , was the main factor of early song ,— these are conclusions for which Bücher offers ample and convincing evidence . ” ( Ib . pp . 108 , 109 . )</p>

    <head>APPENDIX</head>
    <p n="1">TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET</p>
    <p n="2">The following table is designed , in the first place , to illustrate the history of the decasyllabic couplet in English verse , by making possible a comparison of the characteristic details of its form in different periods ; and , in the second place , to suggest a method by which , through the careful tabulation of facts , one may substantiate or correct general statements as to the qualities of verse .</p>
    <p n="3">Any such statistics as are here presented must be accepted , if at all , with no little caution . The table is based on passages of one hundred lines each , believed to be fairly representative of the verse of the several authors . No passage of this length , however , can be known to be perfectly typical . A still greater difficulty is found in the necessarily subjective character of any such tabulation . Most lines of English decasyllabic verse can be read — with reference to the distribution of accents and pauses — in more than one way . It is unlikely , therefore , that any two readers would reach the same results in trying to form a table of this kind . The absolute validity of the figures is therefore doubtful ; but on condition that they all have been computed by the same person , consistently with a single standard of judgment , their relative validity , for purposes of comparison , may be fairly assumed .</p>
    <p n="4">The facts here set down for each specimen of verse group themselves in four divisions . In the first place , each line of verse is either “ run-on ” or “ end-stopped ” ; and , in riming couplets , it is also of interest to know whether the second line of the couplet is run-on into the following couplet . In the second place , the cesural pause occurs either near the middle of the line or elsewhere , or — it may be — is omitted altogether . In the third place , the line may have a feminine ending . In the fourth place , it may contain some other foot than the regular iambus .</p>
    <p n="5">There is some room for difference of judgment as to whether a given line is “ end-stopped ” or “ run-on ” ; but with occasional exceptions the presence or want of a mark of punctuation may be made the determining element . Obviously one may find such clear phrase-pauses , without punctuation , as will justify the caption “ end-stopped . ”</p>
    <p n="6">There is far more divergence of judgment in the recognition of the cesura . Some writers on prosody treat practically every line of ten syllables as having a cesural pause , and certainly some slight phrase-pause may almost always be found . In the following table , however , the cesura has been recognized only when there is a grammatical or rhetorical pause so considerable as — in most cases — to require a mark of punctuation . Such a verse , then , as —</p>
    <p n="7">“ Fate snatch 'd her early to the pitying sky ”</p>
    <p n="8">is counted as having “ no cesura . ” The cesura is counted as “ medial ” when occurring after the fourth , fifth , or sixth syllable ; elsewhere it is regarded as “ variant . ” The significance of this distinction is very clear in the comparison of the heroic couplet of the “ classical ” with that of the “ romantic ” school of poets .<span type="note_anchor">[ 60 ]</span></p>
    <p n="9">It is in the last group of facts , those relating to substituted feet , that the subjective element is most embarrassing . There can be no very general agreement among readers as to the degree of accent necessary to change a pair of syllables from an “ iambus ” to a “ pyrrhic ” or a “ spondee . ” The other two forms of substitution ( inverted accent , giving “ trochees , ” and trisyllabic feet , giving “ anapests ” ) are somewhat more definitely determinable . In the following table the naming of all these feet is based on what is believed to be the natural reading of the verse , with a due regard for both rhetorical and metrical accent . In the verse —</p>
    <p n="10">“ By these the springs of property were bent ”</p>
    <p n="11">the fourth foot is counted a pyrrhic ; so also in this —</p>
    <p n="12">“ Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews , ”</p>
    <p n="13">although here a certain secondary accent on the eighth syllable is possible . In such a verse as —</p>
    <p n="14">“ There is a path on the sea 's azure floor ”</p>
    <p n="15">the third foot is counted a pyrrhic and the fourth a spondee .<span type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span></p>
    <p n="16">One may get , then , from a table of this sort , a general view of the character of any particular piece of verse , in respect to the poet 's preference for run-on lines , for feminine endings , for breaking the verse into two equal parts , for varying the cesura , or for substituting exceptional feet . The description would be more nearly complete if there were also indicated the places in the verse where substituted feet occur ; a trochee in the second foot is a very different thing from one in the first ; but it is difficult to tabulate facts of this order without complicating one 's results beyond the point of serviceable clearness .</p>
    <p n="17">Some students of verse are doubtless offended by the use of statistics in connection with a subject of this kind ; and it is easy to ridicule the obvious incongruity of mathematical methods and poetry . A recent magazine critic makes merry over certain statistical studies in rhythm , carried on in a laboratory by recording the beats in nursery-rimes on the one hand and in hymns on the other . “ There is a certain class of problems , ” he observes most justly , “ whose external aspects may possibly yield to statistical tabulation , but which in the last resort must be spiritually discerned . "[ 62 ] Poetry is unquestionably of this class . Yet this would not seem to forbid the study , by scientific methods , of those “ external aspects ” admittedly susceptible of tabulation . One is not likely to recommend elementary students to count trochees and cesuras in order to increase their appreciation of good verse . But when one comes to the point of generalizing as to the laws or history of verse-forms , it is well to have a method of correction , representable in figures black and white , for the vague impressions which are all that appreciative reading can give . Perhaps the real service of such a method as has just been described is to prevent one from making hasty generalizations which statistics will not support .</p>
    <p n="18">Obviously the same system can be applied to blank verse , with the omission of the second category in the table . A convenient method of making such a study is to use sheets of paper ruled for twenty-five lines and seven columns . Each horizontal line represents a line of verse analyzed . The columns are headed “ Cesura , ” “ T , ” “ P , ” “ S , ” “ A , ” “ Run-on , ” and “ Fem . Ending . ” A cesural pause between the third and fourth syllables is indicated by the figures 3 / 4 in the first column . A trochee in the first foot is indicated by the figure 1 in the “ T ” column ; a spondee in the fourth foot by the figure 4 in the “ S ” column ; and so on . A simple check-mark in the sixth or seventh column indicates respectively a case of enjambement or of feminine ending . When the tabulation is complete , one can easily note the proportion of run-on lines and exceptional cesuras , and can also determine at a glance not only the number of exceptional feet but the parts of the verse in which they occur .</p>
    <p n="19">In the following table the figures regarding the couplets of Spenser are based on his Mother Hubbard 's Tale ; those relating to Joseph Hall , on the Satires of his Virgidemiarum ( see p. 182 ) ; those relating to Leigh Hunt , on The Story of Rimini ; those relating to Keats , on Endymion ; to Browning , on Sordello .</p>

    <p n="24"><span type="note_anchor">[ 60 ]</span>Here a word of caution is needed . It will be observed that the regularly balanced line of the classical couplet requires not only a medial pause , but also a pause at the end . Hence where we find , as in the verse of Keats , a large number of medial cesuras but at the same time a very large number of “ run-on ” lines , the characteristic effect of the medial pause is almost entirely lost , and the number of medial pauses is not significant .</p>
    <p n="25"><span type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span>This combination ( of pyrrhic and spondee ) is of course very frequent ; and where both substitutions occur together , the general average of accents is maintained , only with exchange of position . On the other hand , where there appears a large number of pyrrhics with almost no spondees ( as in the case of Dryden ) , a different sort of verse is indicated ,— one where the lines gain a certain lightness and rapidity from the lack of the full number of fully accented syllables .</p>
