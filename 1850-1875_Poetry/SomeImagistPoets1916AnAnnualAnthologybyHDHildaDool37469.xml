    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In bringing the second volume of Some Imagist Poets before the public , the authors wish to express their gratitude for the interest which the 1915 volume aroused . The discussion of it was widespread , and even those critics out of sympathy with Imagist tenets accorded it much space . In the Preface to that book , we endeavoured to present those tenets in a succinct form . But the very brevity we employed has lead to a great deal of misunderstanding . We have decided , therefore , to explain the laws which govern us a little more fully . A few people may understand , and the rest can merely misunderstand again , a result to which we are quite accustomed .</p>
    <p n="2">In the first place “ Imagism ” does not mean merely the presentation of pictures . “ Imagism ” refers to the manner of presentation , not to the subject . It means a clear presentation of whatever the author wishes to convey . Now he may wish to convey a mood of indecision , in which case the poem should be indecisive ; he may wish to bring before his reader the constantly shifting and changing lights over a landscape , or the varying attitudes of mind of a person under strong emotion , then his poem must shift and change to present this clearly . The “ exact ” word does not mean the word which exactly describes the object in itself , it means the “ exact ” word which brings the effect of that object before the reader as it presented itself to the poet 's mind at the time of writing the poem . Imagists deal but little with similes , although much of their poetry is metaphorical . The reason for this is that while acknowledging the figure to be an integral part of all poetry , they feel that the constant imposing of one figure upon another in the same poem blurs the central effect .</p>
    <p n="3">The great French critic , Remy de Gourmont , wrote last Summer in La France that the Imagists were the descendants of the French Symbolistes . In the Preface to his Livre des Masques , M. de Gourmont has thus described Symbolisme : “ Individualism in literature , liberty of art , abandonment of existing forms .... The sole excuse which a man can have for writing is to write down himself , to unveil for others the sort of world which mirrors itself in his individual glass .... He should create his own aesthetics — and we should admit as many aesthetics as there are original minds , and judge them for what they are and not what they are not . ” In this sense the Imagists are descendants of the Symbolistes ; they are Individualists .</p>
    <p n="4">The only reason that Imagism has seemed so anarchaic and strange to English and American reviewers is that their minds do not easily and quickly suggest the steps by which modern art has arrived at its present position . Its immediate prototype cannot be found in English or American literature , we must turn to Europe for it . With Debussy and Stravinsky in music , and Gauguin and Matisse in painting , it should have been evident to every one that art was entering upon an era of change . But music and painting are universal languages , so we have become accustomed to new idioms in them , while we still find it hard to recognize a changed idiom in literature .</p>
    <p n="5">The crux of the situation is just here . It is in the idiom employed . Imagism asks to be judged by different standards from those employed in Nineteenth-Century art . It is small wonder that Imagist poetry should be incomprehensible to men whose sole touchstone for art is the literature of one country for a period of four centuries . And it is an illuminating fact that among poets and men conversant with many poetic idioms , Imagism is rarely misconceived . They may not agree with us , but they do not misunderstand us .</p>
    <p n="6">This must not be misconstrued into the desire to belittle our forerunners . On the contrary , the Imagists have the greatest admiration for the past , and humility towards it . But they have been caught in the throes of a new birth . The exterior world is changing , and with it men 's feelings , and every age must express its feelings in its own individual way . No art is any more “ egoistic ” than another ; all art is an attempt to express the feelings of the artist , whether it be couched in narrative form or employ a more personal expression .</p>
    <p n="7">It is not what Imagists write about which makes them hard of comprehension ; it is the way they write it . All nations have laws of prosody , which undergo changes from time to time . The laws of English metrical prosody are well known to every one concerned with the subject . But that is only one form of prosody . Other nations have had different ones : Anglo-Saxon poetry was founded upon alliteration , Greek and Roman was built upon quantity , the Oriental was formed out of repetition , and the Japanese Hokku got its effects by an exact and never-to-be-added-to series of single syllables . So it is evident that poetry can be written in many modes . That the Imagists base much of their poetry upon cadence and not upon metre makes them neither good nor bad . And no one realizes more than they that no theories nor rules make poetry . They claim for their work only that it is sincere .</p>
    <p n="8">It is this very fact of “ cadence ” which has misled so many reviewers , until some have been betrayed into saying that the Imagists discard rhythm , when rhythm is the most important quality in their technique . The definition of vers libre is — a verse-form based upon cadence . Now cadence in music is one thing , cadence in poetry quite another , since we are not dealing with tone but with rhythm . It is the sense of perfect balance of flow and rhythm . Not only must the syllables so fall as to increase and continue the movement , but the whole poem must be as rounded and recurring as the circular swing of a balanced pendulum . It can be fast or slow , it may even jerk , but this perfect swing it must have , even its jerks must follow the central movement . To illustrate : Suppose a person were given the task of walking , or running , round a large circle , with two minutes given to do it in . Two minutes which he would just consume if he walked round the circle quietly . But in order to make the task easier for him , or harder , as the case might be , he was required to complete each half of the circle in exactly a minute . No other restrictions were placed upon him . He might dawdle in the beginning , and run madly to reach the half-circle mark on time , and then complete his task by walking steadily round the second half to goal . Or he might leap , and run , and skip , and linger in all sorts of ways , making up for slow going by fast , and for extra haste by pauses , and varying these movements on either lap of the circle as the humour seized him , only so that he were just one minute in traversing the first half-circle , and just one minute in traversing the second . Another illustration which may be employed is that of a Japanese wood-carving where a toad in one corner is balanced by a spray of blown flowers in the opposite upper one . The flowers are not the same shape as the toad , neither are they the same size , but the balance is preserved .</p>
    <p n="9">The unit in vers libre is not the foot , the number of the syllables , the quantity , or the line . The unit is the strophe , which may be the whole poem , or may be only a part . Each strophe is a complete circle : in fact , the meaning of the Greek word “ strophe ” is simply that part of the poem which was recited while the chorus were making a turn round the altar set up in the centre of the theatre . The simile of the circle is more than a simile , therefore ; it is a fact . Of course the circle need not always be the same size , nor need the times allowed to negotiate it be always the same . There is room here for an infinite number of variations . Also , circles can be added to circles , movement upon movement , to the poem , provided each movement completes itself , and ramifies naturally into the next . But one thing must be borne in mind : a cadenced poem is written to be read aloud , in this way only will its rhythm be felt . Poetry is a spoken and not a written art .</p>
    <p n="10">The vers libristes are often accused of declaring that they have discovered a new thing . Where such an idea started , it is impossible to say , certainly none of the better vers libristes was ever guilty of so ridiculous a statement . The name vers libre is new , the thing , most emphatically , is not . Not new in English poetry , at any rate . You will find something very much like it in Dryden 's Threnodia Augustalis ; a great deal of Milton 's Samson Agonistes is written in it ; and Matthew Arnold 's Philomela is a shining example of it . Practically all of Henley 's London Voluntaries are written in it , and ( so potent are names ) until it was christened vers libre , no one thought of objecting to it . But the oldest reference to vers libre is to be found in Chaucer 's House of Fame , where the Eagle addresses the Poet in these words :</p>
    <p n="11">And nevertheless hast set thy wyt Although that in thy heed full lyte is To make bookes , songes , or dytees In rhyme or elles in cadence .</p>
    <p n="12">Commentators have wasted reams of paper in an endeavour to determine what Chaucer meant by this . But is it not possible that he meant a verse based upon rhythm , but which did not follow the strict metrical prosody of his usual practice ?</p>
    <p n="13">One of the charges frequently brought against the Imagists is that they write , not poetry , but “ shredded prose . ” This misconception springs from the almost complete ignorance of the public in regard to the laws of cadenced verse . But , in fact , what is prose and what is poetry ? Is it merely a matter of typographical arrangement ? Must everything which is printed in equal lines , with rhymes at the ends , be called poetry , and everything which is printed in a block be called prose ? Aristotle , who certainly knew more about this subject than any one else , declares in his Rhetoric that prose is rhythmical without being metrical ( that is to say , without insistence on any single rhythm ) , and then goes on to state the feet that are employed in prose , making , incidentally , the remark that the iambic prevailed in ordinary conversation . The fact is , that there is no hard and fast dividing line between prose and poetry . As a French poet of distinction , Paul Fort , has said : “ Prose and poetry are but one instrument , graduated . ” It is not a question of typography ; it is not even a question of rules and forms . Poetry is the vision in a man 's soul which he translates as best he can with the means at his disposal .</p>
    <p n="14">We are young , we are experimentalists , but we ask to be judged by our own standards , not by those which have governed other men at other times .</p>

   <p>The authors wish to express their gratitude to the editors of The Egoist and Poetry and Drama , London ; The Poetry Journal , Boston ; The Little Review and Poetry , Chicago , for permission to reprint certain of these poems which originally appeared in their columns . To Poetry belongs the credit of having introduced Imagism to the world : it seems fitting , therefore , that the authors should record their thanks in this place for the constant interest and encouragement shown them by its editor , Miss Harriet Monroe .</p>

     <l n="11">At the red and white shining tiles —</l>
     <l n="12">A tall stone statue of Cobden .</l>
     <l n="13">And though no one ever pauses to see</l>

   <p>EASTER</p>
   <p>Friend we will take the path that leads down from the flagstaff by the pond through the gorse thickets ; see , the golden spikes have thrust their points through , and last year 's bracken lies yellow-brown and trampled . The sapling birch-groves have shown no leaf , and the wistarias on the desolate pergola are shorn and ashen . We lurch on , and , stumbling , touch each other . You do not shrink , friend . There you , and I here , side by side , we go , jesting . We do not seek , we do not avoid , contact .</p>
   <p>Here is the road , with the budding elm-trees lining it , and there the low gate in the wall ; on the other side , the people . Are they not aliens ? You and I for a moment see them shabby of limb and soul , patched up to make shift . We laugh and strengthen each other ; But the evil is done .</p>
   <p>Is not the whole park made for them , and the bushes and plants and trees and grasses , have they not grown to their standard ? The paths are worn to the gravel with their feet ; the green moss will not carpet them . The flags of the stone steps are hollowed ; and you and I must strive to remain two and not to merge in the multitude . It impinges on us ; it separates us ; we shrink from it ; we brave through it ; we laugh ; we jest ; we jeer ; and we save the fragments of our souls .</p>
   <p>Between two clipped privet hedges now ; we will close our eyes for life 's sake to life 's patches . Here , maybe , there is quiet ; pass first under the bare branches , beyond is a pool flanked with sedge , and a swan among water-lilies . But here too is a group of men and women and children ; and the swan has forgotten its pride ; it thrusts its white neck among them , and gobbles at nothing ; then tires of the cheat and sails off ; but its breast urges before it a sheet of sodden newspaper that , drifting away , reveals beneath the immaculate white splendour of its neck and wings a breast black with scum .</p>
   <p>Friend , we are beaten .</p>
   <p>OGRE</p>
   <p>Through the open window can be seen the poplars at the end of the garden shaking in the wind , a wall of green leaves so high that the sky is shut off .</p>
   <p>On the white table-cloth a rose in a vase — centre of a sphere of odour — contemplates the crumbs and crusts left from a meal : cups , saucers , plates lie here and there .</p>
   <p>And a sparrow flies by the open window , stops for a moment , flutters his wings rapidly , and climbs an aerial ladder with his claws that work close in to his soft , brown-grey belly .</p>
   <p>But behind the table is the face of a man .</p>
   <p>The bird flies off .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CONES</head>
     <l n="1">The blue mist of after-rain</l>
     <l n="2">fills all the trees ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>the sunlight gilds the tops of the poplar spires , far off , behind the houses .</p>
   <p>Here a branch sways and there a sparrow twitters .</p>
   <p>The curtain 's hem , rose-embroidered , flutters , and half reveals a burnt-red chimney pot .</p>
   <p>The quiet in the room bears patiently a footfall on the street .</p>
   <p>GLOOM</p>
   <p>I sat there in the dark of the room and of my mind thinking of men 's treasons and bad faith , sinking into the pit of my own weakness before their strength of cunning . Out over the gardens came the sound of some one playing five-finger exercises on the piano .</p>
   <p>Then I gathered up within me all my powers until outside of me was nothing : I was all — all stubborn , fighting sadness and revulsion .</p>
   <p>And one came from the garden quietly , and stood beside me . She laid her hand on my hair ; she laid her cheek on my forehead ,— and caressed me with it ; but all my being rose to my forehead to fight against this outside thing . Something in me became angry ; withstood like a wall , and would allow no entrance ; I hated her .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ What is the matter with you , dear ? ” she said .</l>
     <l n="2">“ Nothing , ” I answered ,</l>
     <l n="3">“ I am thinking . ”</l>
     <l n="4">She stroked my hair and went away ;</l>
     <l n="5">and I was still gloomy , angry , stubborn .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Then I thought : she has gone away ; she is hurt ; she does not know what poison has been working in me .</p>
   <p>Then I thought : upstairs , her child is sleeping ; and I felt the presence of the fields we had walked over , the roads we had followed , the flowers we had watched together , before it came .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">She had touched my hair , and only then did I feel it ;</l>
     <l n="2">And I loved her once again .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And I came away , full of the sweet and bitter juices of life ; and I lit the lamp in my room , and made this poem .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TERROR</head>
    <head>Eyes are tired ; the lamp burns , and in its circle of light papers and books lie where chance and life have placed them .</head>
    <head>Silence sings all around me ; my head is bound with a band ; outside in the street a few footsteps ; a clock strikes the hour .</head>
     <l n="1">I gaze , and my eyes close ,</l>
     <l n="2">slowly :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I doze ; but the moment before sleep , a voice calls my name in my ear , and the shock jolts my heart : but when I open my eyes , and look , first left , and then right ...</p>
   <p>no one is there .</p>
   <p>CHALFONT SAINT GILES</p>
   <p>The low graves are all grown over with forget-me-not , and a rich-green grass links each with each . Old family vaults , some within railings , stand here and there , crumbling , moss-eaten , with the ivy growing up them and diagonally across the top projecting slab . And over the vaults lean the great lilac bushes with their heart-shaped leaves and their purple and white blossom . A wall of ivy shuts off the darkness of the elm-wood and the larches .</p>
   <p>Walk quietly along the mossy paths ; the stones of the humble dead are hidden behind the blue mantle of their forget-me-nots ; and before one grave so hidden a widow kneels , with head bowed , and the crape falling over her shoulders .</p>
   <p>The bells for evening church are ringing , and the people come gravely and with red , sun-burnt faces through the gates in the wall .</p>
   <p>Pass on ; this is the church-porch , and within the bell-ringers , men of the village in their Sunday clothes , pull their bob-major on the red and white grip of the bell-ropes , that fly up , and then fall snakily . They stand there given wholly to the rhythm and swing of their traditional movements .</p>
   <p>And the people pass between them into the church ; but we are too sad and too reverent to enter .</p>
   <p>WAR-TIME</p>
   <p>If I go out of the door , it will not be to take the road to the left that leads past the bovine quiet of houses brooding over the cud of their daily content , even though the tranquillity of their gardens is a lure that once was stronger ; even though from privet hedge and mottled laurel the young green peeps , and the daffodils and the yellow and white and purple crocuses laugh from the smooth mould of the garden beds to the upright golden buds of the chestnut trees . I shall not see the almond blossom shaming the soot-black boughs .</p>
   <p>But to the right the road will lead me to greater and greater disquiet ; into the swift rattling noise of the motor - ‘ busses , and the dust , the tattered paper — the detritus of a city — that swirls in the air behind them . I will pass the shops where the prices are judged day by day by the people , and come to the place where five roads meet with five tram-routes , and where amid the din of the vans , the lorries , the motor - ‘ busses , the clangorous tram-cars , the news is shouted , and soldiers gather , off-duty .</p>
   <p>Here I can feel the heat of Europe 's fever ; and I can make , as each man makes the beauty of the woman he loves , no spring and no woman 's beauty , while that is burning .</p>

    <head>SPRING DAY</head>
    <head>BATH</head>
     <l n="1">The day is fresh-washed and fair , and there is a smell of tulips and</l>
     <l n="2">narcissus in the air .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish white . It cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel , and cracks it to bright light .</p>
   <p>Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance , dance , and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling ; a stir of my finger sets them whirring , reeling . I move a foot and the planes of light in the water jar . I lie back and laugh , and let the green-white water , the sun-flawed beryl water , flow over me . The day is almost too bright to bear , the green water covers me from the too bright day . I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots .</p>
   <p>The sky is blue and high . A crow flaps by the window , and there is a whirl of tulips and narcissus in the air .</p>
   <p>BREAKFAST TABLE</p>
   <p>In the fresh-washed sunlight , the breakfast table is decked and white . It offers itself in flat surrender , tendering tastes , and smells , and colours , and metals , and grains , and the white cloth falls over its side , draped and wide . Wheels of white glitter in the silver coffee pot , hot and spinning like catherine-wheels , they whirl , and twirl — and my eyes begin to smart , the little white , dazzling wheels prick them like darts . Placid and peaceful the rolls of bread spread themselves in the sun to bask . A stack of butter-pats , pyramidal , shout orange through the white , scream , flutter , call : “ Yellow ! Yellow ! Yellow ! ” Coffee steam rises in a stream , clouds the silver tea-service with mist , and twists up into the sunlight , revolved , involuted , suspiring higher and higher , fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky . A crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam . The day is new and fair with good smells in the air .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>WALK</head>
     <l n="1">Over the street the white clouds meet , and sheer away without</l>
     <l n="2">touching .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On the sidewalk boys are playing marbles . Glass marbles , with amber and blue hearts , roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise . The boys strike them with black and red striped agates . The glass marbles spit crimson when they are hit , and slip into the gutters under rushing brown water . I smell tulips and narcissus in the air , but there are no flowers anywhere , only white dust whipping up the street , and a girl with a gay spring hat and blowing skirts . The dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat , high-heeled patent leather shoes . Tap , tap , the little heels pat the pavement , and the wind rustles among the flowers on her hat .</p>
   <p>A water-cart crawls slowly on the other side of the way . It is green and gay with new paint , and rumbles contentedly sprinkling clear water over the white dust . Clear zig-zagging water which smells of tulips and narcissus .</p>
   <p>The thickening branches make a pink “ grisaille ” against the blue sky .</p>
   <p>Whoop ! The clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time . Whoop ! And a man 's hat careers down the street in front of the white dust , leaps into the branches of a tree , veers away and trundles ahead of the wind , jarring the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green .</p>
   <p>A motor car cuts a swath through the bright air , sharp-beaked , irresistible , shouting to the wind to make way . A glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it , and settles down . The sky is quiet and high , and the morning is fair with fresh-washed air .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MIDDAY AND AFTERNOON</head>
    <head>Swirl of crowded streets . Shock and recoil of traffic . The stock-still brick facade of an old church , against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw . Flare of sunshine down side-streets . Eddies of light in the windows of chemists ’ shops , with their blue , gold , purple jars , darting colours far into the crowd . Loud bangs and tremors , murmurings out of high windows , whirling of machine belts , blurring of horses and motors . A quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car , and the jar of a church bell knocking against the metal blue of the sky . I am a piece of the town , a bit of blown dust , thrust along with the crowd . Proud to feel the pavement under me , reeling with feet . Feet tripping , skipping , lagging , dragging , plodding doggedly , or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps . A boy is selling papers , I smell them clean and new from the press . They are fresh like the air , and pungent as tulips and narcissus .</head>
     <l n="1">The blue sky pales to lemon , and great tongues of gold blind the</l>
     <l n="2">shop-windows putting out their contents in a flood of flame .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>NIGHT AND SLEEP</p>
   <p>The day takes her ease in slippered yellow . Electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts , following each other . They grow , and grow , and blow into patterns of fire-flowers , as the sky fades . Trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night . Twinkle , jab , snap , that means a new play ; and over the way : plop , drop , quiver is the sidelong sliver of a watch-maker 's sign with its length on another street . A gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building , but the sky is high and has her own stars , why should she heed ours ?</p>
   <p>I leave the city with speed . Wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness . The breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and clean , it has come but recently from the high sky . There are no flowers in bloom yet , but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus .</p>
   <p>My room is tranquil and friendly . Out of the window I can see the distant city , a band of twinkling gems , little flower heads with no stems . I cannot see the beer glass , nor the letters of the restaurants and shops I passed , now the signs blur and all together make the city , glowing on a night of fine weather , like a garden stirring and blowing for the Spring .</p>
   <p>The night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air .</p>
   <p>Wrap me close , sheets of lavender . Pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears . The breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days , and cobbled streets , and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways . Pale blue lavender , you are the colour of the sky when it is fresh-washed and fair ... I smell the stars ... they are like tulips and narcissus ... I smell them in the air .</p>
   <p>STRAVINSKY 'S THREE PIECES , “ GROTESQUES ” FOR STRING QUARTET</p>
   <p>This Quartet was played from the manuscript by the Flonzaley Quartet during their season of 1915 and 1916 . The poem is based upon the programme which M. Stravinsky appended to his piece , and is an attempt to reproduce the sound and movement of the music as far as is possible in another medium .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FIRST MOVEMENT</head>
     <l n="1">Thin-voiced , nasal pipes</l>
     <l n="2">Drawing sound out and out</l>
     <l n="3">Until it is a screeching thread ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sharp and cutting , sharp and cutting ,</l>
     <l n="5">It hurts .</l>
     <l n="6">Whee-e-e !</l>
     <l n="7">Bump ! Bump ! Tong-ti-bump !</l>
     <l n="8">There are drums here ,</l>
     <l n="9">Banging ,</l>
     <l n="10">And wooden shoes beating the round , grey stones</l>
     <l n="11">Of the market-place .</l>
     <l n="12">Whee-e-e !</l>
     <l n="13">Sabots slapping the worn , old stones ,</l>
     <l n="14">And a shaking and cracking of dancing bones ,</l>
     <l n="15">Clumsy and hard they are ,</l>
     <l n="16">And uneven ,</l>
     <l n="17">Losing half a beat</l>
     <l n="18">Because the stones are slippery .</l>
     <l n="19">Bump-e-ty-tong ! Whee-e-e ! Tong !</l>
     <l n="20">The thin Spring leaves</l>
     <l n="21">Shake to the banging of shoes .</l>
     <l n="22">Shoes beat , slap ,</l>
     <l n="23">Shuffle , rap ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the nasal pipes squeal with their pigs ’ voices ,</l>
     <l n="25">Little pigs ’ voices</l>
     <l n="26">Weaving among the dancers ,</l>
     <l n="27">A fine , white thread</l>
     <l n="28">Linking up the dancers .</l>
     <l n="29">Bang ! Bump ! Tong !</l>
     <l n="30">Petticoats ,</l>
     <l n="31">Stockings ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sabots ,</l>
     <l n="33">Delirium flapping its thigh-bones ;</l>
     <l n="34">Red , blue , yellow ,</l>
     <l n="35">Drunkenness steaming in colours ;</l>
     <l n="36">Red , yellow , blue ,</l>
     <l n="37">Colours and flesh weaving together ,</l>
     <l n="38">In and out , with the dance ,</l>
     <l n="39">Coarse stuffs and hot flesh weaving together .</l>
     <l n="40">Pigs ’ cries white and tenuous ,</l>
     <l n="41">White and painful ,</l>
     <l n="42">White and —</l>
     <l n="43">Bump !</l>
     <l n="44">Tong !</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SECOND MOVEMENT</head>
     <l n="1">Pale violin music whiffs across the moon ,</l>
     <l n="2">A pale smoke of violin music blows over the moon ,</l>
     <l n="3">Cherry petals fall and flutter ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the white Pierrot ,</l>
     <l n="5">Wreathed in the smoke of the violins ,</l>
     <l n="6">Splashed with cherry petals falling , falling ,</l>
     <l n="7">Claws a grave for himself in the fresh earth</l>
     <l n="8">With his finger-nails .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THIRD MOVEMENT</head>
     <l n="1">An organ growls in the heavy roof-groins of a church ,</l>
     <l n="2">It wheezes and coughs .</l>
     <l n="3">The nave is blue with incense ,</l>
     <l n="4">Writhing , twisting ,</l>
     <l n="5">Snaking over the heads of the chanting priests .</l>
     <l n="6">Requiem aeternam dona ei , Domine ;</l>
     <l n="7">The priests whine their bastard Latin</l>
     <l n="8">And the censers swing and click .</l>
     <l n="9">The priests walk endlessly</l>
     <l n="10">Round and round ,</l>
     <l n="11">Droning their Latin</l>
     <l n="12">Off the key .</l>
     <l n="13">The organ crashes out in a flaring chord</l>
     <l n="14">And the priests hitch their chant up half a tone .</l>
     <l n="15">Dies illa , dies irae ,</l>
     <l n="16">Calamitatis et miseriae ,</l>
     <l n="17">Dies magna et amara valde .</l>
     <l n="18">A wind rattles the leaded windows .</l>
     <l n="19">The little pear-shaped candle-flames leap and flutter .</l>
     <l n="20">Dies illa , dies irae ,</l>
     <l n="21">The swaying smoke drifts over the altar .</l>
     <l n="22">Calamitatis et miseriae ,</l>
     <l n="23">The shuffling priests sprinkle holy water .</l>
     <l n="24">Dies magna et amara valde .</l>
     <l n="25">And there is a stark stillness in the midst of them ,</l>
     <l n="26">Stretched upon a bier .</l>
     <l n="27">His ears are stone to the organ ,</l>
     <l n="28">His eyes are flint to the candles ,</l>
     <l n="29">His body is ice to the water .</l>
     <l n="30">Chant , priests ,</l>
     <l n="31">Whine , shuffle , genuflect .</l>
     <l n="32">He will always be as rigid as he is now</l>
     <l n="33">Until he crumbles away in a dust heap .</l>
     <l n="34">Lacrymosa dies illa ,</l>
     <l n="35">Qua resurget ex favilla</l>
     <l n="36">Judicandus homo reus .</l>
     <l n="37">Above the grey pillars , the roof is in darkness .</l>
