    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The poets of the South , who constitute a worthy galaxy of poetic talent and achievement , are not sufficiently known . Even in the South , which might naturally be expected to take pride in its gifted singers , most of them , it is to be feared , are but little read .</p>
    <p n="2">This has been called an age of prose . Under the sway of what are regarded as “ practical interests , ” there is a drifting away from poetic sentiment and poetic truth . This tendency is to be regretted , for material prosperity is never at its best without the grace and refinements of true culture . At the present time , as in former ages , the gifted poet is a seer , who reveals to us what is highest and best in life .</p>
    <p n="3">There is at present a new interest in literature in the South . The people read more ; and in recent years an encouraging number of Southern writers have achieved national distinction . With this literary renaissance , there has been a turning back to older authors .</p>
    <p n="4">It is hoped that this little volume will supply a real need . It is intended to call fresh attention to the poetic achievement of the South . While minor poets are not forgotten , among whose writings is found many a gem of poetry , it is the leaders of the chorus — Poe , Hayne , Timrod , Lanier , and Ryan — who receive chief consideration . It may be doubted whether several of them have been given the place in American letters to which their gifts and achievements justly entitle them . It is hoped that the following biographical and critical sketches of these men , each highly gifted in his own way , will lead to a more careful reading of their works , in which , be it said to their honor , there is no thought or sentiment unworthy of a refined and chivalrous nature .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER I</head>
    <head>MINOR POETS OF THE SOUTH</head>
    <head>The first poetic writer of this country had his home at Jamestown . He was GEORGE SANDYS who came to Virginia in 1621 , and succeeded his brother as treasurer of the newly established colony . Amid the hardships of pioneer colonial life , in which he proved himself a leading spirit , he had the literary zeal to complete his translation of Ovid 's Metamorphoses , which he had begun in England . After the toilsome day , spent in introducing iron works or in encouraging shipbuilding , he sat down at night , within the shadow of surrounding forests , to construct his careful , rhymed pentameters . The conditions under which he wrote were very far removed from the Golden Age which he described ,—</head>
     <l n="1">“ Which uncompelled</l>
     <l n="2">And without rule , in faith and truth , excelled . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The promise of this bright , heroic beginning in poetry was not realized ; and scarcely another voice was heard in verse in the South before the Revolution . The type of civilization developed in the South prior to the Civil War , admirable as it was in many other particulars , was hardly favorable to literature . The energies of the most intelligent portion of the population were directed to agriculture or to politics ; and many of the foremost statesmen of our country — men like Washington , Jefferson , Marshall , Calhoun , Benton — were from the Southern states . The system of slavery , while building up baronial homes of wealth , culture , and boundless hospitality , checked manufacture , retarded the growth of cities , and turned the tide of immigration westward . Without a vigorous public school system , a considerable part of the non-slaveholding class remained without literary taste or culture .</p>
   <p>The South has been chiefly an agricultural region , and has adhered to conservative habits of thought . While various movements in theology , philosophy , and literature were stirring New England , the South pursued the even tenor of its way . Of all parts of our country , it has been most tenacious of old customs and beliefs . Before the Civil War the cultivated classes of the Southern states found their intellectual nourishment in the older English classics , and Pope , Addison , and Shakespeare formed a part of every gentleman 's library . There were no great publishing houses to stimulate literary production ; and to this day Southern writers are dependent chiefly on Northern publishers to give their works to the public . Literature was hardly taken seriously ; it was rather regarded , to use the words of Paul Hamilton Hayne , “ as the choice recreation of gentlemen , as something fair and good , to be courted in a dainty , amateur fashion , and illustrated by apropos quotations from Lucretius , Virgil , or Horace . ” Thus it happened that before the Civil War literature in the South , whether prose or poetry , had a less vigorous development than in the Middle States and New England .</p>
   <p>Yet it has been common to undervalue the literary work of the South . While literature was not generally encouraged there before the Civil War ,— a fact lamented by gifted , representative writers ,— there were at least two literary centers that exerted a notable influence . The first was Richmond , the home of Poe during his earlier years , and of the Southern Literary Messenger , in its day the most influential magazine south of the Potomac . It was founded , as set forth in its first issue , in 1834 , to encourage literature in Virginia and the other states of the South ; and during its career of twenty-eight years it stimulated literary activity in a remarkable degree . Among its contributors we find Poe , Simms , Hayne , Timrod , John Esten Cooke , John R. Thompson , and others — a galaxy of the best-known names in Southern literature .</p>
   <p>The other principal literary center of the South was Charleston . “ Legaré 's wit and scholarship , ” to adopt the words of Mrs. Margaret J. Preston , “ brightened its social circle ; Calhoun 's deep shadow loomed over it from his plantation at Fort Hill ; Gilmore Simms 's genial culture broadened its sympathies . The latter was the Maecenas to a band of brilliant youths who used to meet for literary suppers at his beautiful home . ” Among these brilliant youths were Paul Hamilton Hayne and Henry Timrod , two of the best poets the South has produced . The Southern Literary Gazette , founded by Simms , and Russell 's Magazine , edited by Hayne , were published at Charleston . Louisville and New Orleans were likewise literary centers of more or less influence .</p>
   <p>Yet it is a notable fact that none of these literary centers gave rise to a distinctive group or school of writers . The influence of these centers did not consist in one great dominating principle , but in a general stimulus to literary effort . In this respect it may be fairly claimed that the South was more cosmopolitan than the North . In New England , theology and transcendentalism in turn dominated literature ; and not a few of the group of writers who contributed to the Atlantic Monthly were profoundly influenced by the anti-slavery agitation . They struggled up Parnassus , to use the words of Lowell ,—</p>
   <p>“ With a whole bale of isms tied together with rime . ”</p>
   <p>But the leading writers of the South , as will be seen later , have been exempt , in large measure , from the narrowing influence of one-sided theological or philosophical tenets . They have not aspired to the rôle of social reformers ; and in their loyalty to art , they have abstained from fanatical energy and extravagance .</p>
   <p>The major poets of the South stand out in strong , isolated individuality . They were not bound together by any sympathy other than that of a common interest in art and in their Southern home . Their genius was nourished on the choicest literary productions of England and of classic antiquity ; and looking , with this Old World culture , upon Southern landscape and Southern character , they pictured or interpreted them in the language of poetry .</p>
   <p>The three leading poets of the Civil War period — Hayne , Timrod , and Ryan — keenly felt the issues involved in that great struggle . All three of them were connected , for a time at least , with the Confederate army . In the earlier stages of the conflict , the intensity of their Southern feeling flamed out in thrilling lyrics . Timrod 's martial songs throb with the energy of deep emotion . But all three poets lived to accept the results of the war , and to sing a new loyalty to our great Republic .</p>
   <p>The South has not been as unfruitful in literature as is often supposed . While there have been very few to make literature a vocation , a surprisingly large number have made it an avocation . Law and literature , as we shall have occasion to note , have frequently gone hand in hand . A recent work on Southern literature [*] enumerates more than twelve hundred writers , most of whom have published one or more volumes . There are more than two hundred poets who have been thought worthy of mention . More than fifty poets have been credited to Virginia alone ; and an examination of their works reveals , among a good deal that is commonplace and imitative , many a little gem that ought to be preserved . Apart from the five major poets of the South — Poe , Hayne , Timrod , Lanier , and Ryan — who are reserved for special study , we shall now consider a few of the minor poets who have produced verse of excellent quality . [ Footnote *: Manly 's Southern Literature . ]</p>
   <p>FRANCIS SCOTT KEY ( 1780-1843 ) is known throughout the land as the author of The Star-spangled Banner , the noblest , perhaps , of our patriotic hymns . He was born in Frederick County , Maryland , and was educated at St. John 's College , Annapolis . He studied law , and after practicing with success in Frederick City , he removed to Washington , where he became district attorney .</p>
   <p>During the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812 , he was detained on board a British vessel , whither he had gone to secure the release of a friend . All night long he watched the bombardment with the keenest anxiety . In the morning , when the dawn disclosed the star - spangled banner still proudly waving over the fort , he conceived the stirring song , which at once became popular and was sung all over the country . Though a volume of his poems , with a sketch by Chief-Justice Taney , was published in 1857 , it is to The Star-spangled Banner that he owes his literary fame .</p>

     <l n="1">“ O say , can you see , by the dawn 's early light ,</l>
     <l n="2">What so proudly we hailed at the twilight 's last gleaming ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight</l>
     <l n="4">O'er the ramparts we watched , were so gallantly streaming ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ And the rockets ’ red glare , the bombs bursting in air ,</l>
     <l n="6">Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there .</l>
     <l n="7">O say , does that star-spangled banner yet wave</l>
     <l n="8">O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave ? ”</l>

   <p>Few poems written in the South have been more popular than My Life is like the Summer Rose . It has the distinction of having been praised by Byron . Its author , RICHARD HENRY WILDE ( 1789-1847 ) , was born in Dublin , Ireland , but brought up and educated in Augusta , Georgia . He studied law , became attorney general of his adopted state , and later entered Congress , where he served for several terms . He was a man of scholarly tastes and poetic gifts . He spent five years abroad , chiefly in Italy , where his studies in Italian literature afterwards led to a work on Torquato Tasso . It was on the occasion of this trip abroad that he wrote A Farewell to America , which breathes a noble spirit of patriotism :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Farewell , my more than fatherland !</l>
     <l n="2">Home of my heart and friends , adieu !</l>
     <l n="3">Lingering beside some foreign strand ,</l>
     <l n="4">How oft shall I remember you !</l>
     <l n="5">How often , o'er the waters blue ,</l>
     <l n="6">Send back a sigh to those I leave ,</l>
     <l n="7">The loving and beloved few ,</l>
     <l n="8">Who grieve for me ,— for whom I grieve ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On his return to America , he settled in New Orleans , where he became a professor of law in the University of Louisiana . Though the author of a volume of poems of more than usual excellence , it is the melancholy lyric , My Life is like the Summer Rose , that , more than all the rest , has given him a niche in the temple of literary fame . Is it necessary to quote a stanza of a poem so well known ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ My life is like the summer rose ,</l>
     <l n="2">That opens to the morning sky ,</l>
     <l n="3">But , ere the shades of evening close ,</l>
     <l n="4">Is scattered on the ground — to die !</l>
     <l n="5">Yet on the rose 's humble bed</l>
     <l n="6">The sweetest dews of night are shed ,</l>
     <l n="7">As if she wept the waste to see —</l>
     <l n="8">But none shall weep a tear for me ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>GEORGE D. PRENTICE ( 1802-1870 ) was a native of Connecticut . He was educated at Brown University , and studied law ; but he soon gave up his profession for the more congenial pursuit of literature . In 1828 he established at Hartford the New England Weekly Review , in which a number of his poems , serious and sentimental , appeared . Two years later , at the age of twenty-eight , he turned over his paper to Whittier and removed to Louisville , where he became editor of the Journal .</p>
   <p>He was a man of brilliant intellect , and soon made his paper a power in education , society , and politics . Apart from his own vigorous contributions , he made his paper useful to Southern letters by encouraging literary activity in others . It was chiefly through his influence that Louisville became one of the literary centers of the South . He was a stout opponent of secession ; and when the Civil War came his paper , like his adopted state , suffered severely .</p>
   <p>Among his writings is a Life of Henry Clay . A collection of his witty and pungent paragraphs has also been published under the title of Prenticeana . His poems , by which he will be longest remembered , were collected after his death . His best-known poem is The Closing Year . Though its vividness and eloquence are quite remarkable , its style is , perhaps , too declamatory for the taste of the present generation . The following lines , which express the poet 's bright hopes for the political future of the world , are taken from The Flight of Years :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Weep not , that Time</l>
     <l n="2">Is passing on — it will ere long reveal</l>
     <l n="3">A brighter era to the nations . Hark !</l>
     <l n="4">Along the vales and mountains of the earth</l>
     <l n="5">There is a deep , portentous murmuring</l>
     <l n="6">Like the swift rush of subterranean streams ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or like the mingled sounds of earth and air ,</l>
     <l n="8">When the fierce Tempest , with sonorous wing ,</l>
     <l n="9">Heaves his deep folds upon the rushing winds ,</l>
     <l n="10">And hurries onward with his night of clouds</l>
     <l n="11">Against the eternal mountains . ‘ Tis the voice</l>
     <l n="12">Of infant Freedom — and her stirring call</l>
     <l n="13">Is heard and answered in a thousand tones</l>
     <l n="14">From every hilltop of her western home ——</l>
     <l n="15">And lo — it breaks across old Ocean 's flood ——</l>
     <l n="16">And Freedom , Freedom ! is the answering shout</l>
     <l n="17">Of nations starting from the spell of years .</l>
     <l n="18">The dayspring !— see — ‘ tis brightening in the heavens !</l>
     <l n="19">The watchmen of the night have caught the sign ——</l>
     <l n="20">From tower to tower the signal fires flash free ——</l>
     <l n="21">And the deep watchword , like the rush of seas</l>
     <l n="22">That heralds the volcano 's bursting flame ,</l>
     <l n="23">Is sounding o'er the earth . Bright years of hope</l>
     <l n="24">And life are on the wing .— Yon glorious bow</l>
     <l n="25">Of Freedom , bended by the hand of God ,</l>
     <l n="26">Is spanning Time 's dark surges . Its high arch ,</l>
     <l n="27">A type of love and mercy on the cloud ,</l>
     <l n="28">Tells that the many storms of human life</l>
     <l n="29">Will pass in silence , and the sinking waves ,</l>
     <l n="30">Gathering the forms of glory and of peace ,</l>
     <l n="31">Reflect the undimmed brightness of the Heaven . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>WILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS ( 1806-1870 ) , a native of Charleston , was a man of remarkable versatility . He made up for his lack of collegiate training by private study and wide experience . He early gave up law for literature , and during his long and tireless literary career was editor , poet , dramatist , historian , and novelist . He had something of the wideness of range of Sir Walter Scott ; and one can not but think that , had he lived north of Mason and Dixon 's line , he might occupy a more prominent place in the literary annals of our country . He has been styled the “ Cooper of the South ” ; but it is hardly too much to say that in versatility , culture , and literary productiveness he surpassed his great Northern contemporary .</p>
   <p>Simms was a poet before he became a novelist . The poetic impulse manifested itself early ; and before he was twenty-five he had published three or more volumes of verse . In 1832 his imaginative poem , Atalantis , a Story of the Sea , was brought out by the Harpers ; and it introduced him at once to the favorable notice of what Poe called the “ Literati ” of New York . His subsequent volumes of poetry were devoted chiefly to a description of Southern scenes and incidents .</p>
   <p>As will be seen in our studies of Hayne and Timrod , Simms was an important figure in the literary circles of Charleston . His large , vigorous nature seemed incapable of jealousy , and he took delight in lending encouragement to young men of literary taste and aspiration . He was a laborious and prolific writer , the number of his various works — poetry , drama , history , fiction — reaching nearly a hundred . Had he written less rapidly , his work might have gained , perhaps , in artistic quality .</p>
   <p>Among the best of Simms 's novels is a series devoted to the Revolution . The characters and incidents of that conflict in South Carolina are graphically portrayed . The Partisan , the first of this historic series , was published in 1835 . The Yemassee is an Indian story , in which the character of the red man is less idealized than in Cooper 's Leather - stocking Tales . In The Damsel of Darien , the hero is Balboa , the discoverer of the Pacific .</p>
   <p>The verse of Simms is characterized by facile vigor rather than by fine poetic quality . The following lines , which represent his style at its best , bear a lesson for the American people to-day :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ This the true sign of ruin to a race —</l>
     <l n="2">It undertakes no march , and day by day</l>
     <l n="3">Drowses in camp , or , with the laggard 's pace ,</l>
     <l n="4">Walks sentry o'er possessions that decay ;</l>
     <l n="5">Destined , with sensible waste , to fleet away ;—</l>
     <l n="6">For the first secret of continued power</l>
     <l n="7">Is the continued conquest ;— all our sway</l>
     <l n="8">Hath surety in the uses of the hour ;</l>
     <l n="9">If that we waste , in vain walled town and lofty tower ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>EDWARD COATE PINKNEY ( 1802-1828 ) died before his poetic gifts had reached their full maturity . He was the son of the eminent lawyer and diplomatist , William Pinkney , and was born in London , while his father was American minister at the court of St. James . At the age of nine he was brought home to America , and educated at Baltimore . He spent eight years in the United States navy , during which period he visited the classic shores of the Mediterranean . He was impressed particularly with the beauty of Italy , and in one of his poems he says :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ It looks a dimple on the face of earth ,</l>
     <l n="2">The seal of beauty , and the shrine of mirth ;</l>
     <l n="3">Nature is delicate and graceful there ,</l>
     <l n="4">The place 's genius feminine and fair :</l>
     <l n="5">The winds are awed , nor dare to breathe aloud ;</l>
     <l n="6">The air seems never to have borne a cloud ,</l>
     <l n="7">Save where volcanoes send to heaven their curled</l>
     <l n="8">And solemn smokes , like altars of the world . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In 1824 he resigned his place in the navy to take up the practice of law in Baltimore . His health was not good ; and he seems to have occupied a part of his abundant leisure ( for he was not successful in his profession ) in writing poetry . A thin volume of poems was published in 1825 , in which he displays , especially in his shorter pieces , an excellent lyrical gift . The following stanzas are from A Health :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I fill this cup to one made up</l>
     <l n="2">Of loveliness alone ,</l>
     <l n="3">A woman , of her gentle sex</l>
     <l n="4">The seeming paragon ;</l>
     <l n="5">To whom the better elements</l>
     <l n="6">And kindly stars have given</l>
     <l n="7">A form so fair , that , like the air ,</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis less of earth than heaven .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">“ Her every tone is music 's own ,</l>
     <l n="10">Like those of morning birds ,</l>
     <l n="11">And something more than melody</l>
     <l n="12">Dwells ever in her words ;</l>
     <l n="13">The coinage of her heart are they ,</l>
     <l n="14">And from her lips each flows</l>
     <l n="15">As one may see the burdened bee</l>
     <l n="16">Forth issue from the rose . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>PHILIP PENDLETON COOKE ( 1816-1850 ) , like most Southern writers before the Civil War , mingled literature with the practice of law . He was born at Martinsburg , Virginia , and educated at Princeton . He early manifested a literary bent , and wrote for the Knickerbocker Magazine , the oldest of our literary monthlies , before he was out of his teens . He was noted for his love of outdoor life , and became a thorough sportsman . In 1847 he published a volume entitled Froissart Ballads and Other Poems . The origin of the ballad portion of the volume , as explained in the preface , is found in the lines of an old Roman poet :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ A certain freak has got into my head ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which I can n't conquer for the life of me ,</l>
     <l n="3">Of taking up some history , little read ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or known , and writing it in poetry . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The best known of his lyrics is Florence Vane which has the</l>
     <l n="6">sincerity and pathos of a real experience :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">“ I loved thee long and dearly ,</l>
     <l n="8">Florence Vane ;</l>
     <l n="9">My life 's bright dream , and early ,</l>
     <l n="10">Hath come again ;</l>
     <l n="11">I renew , in my fond vision ,</l>
     <l n="12">My heart 's dear pain ,</l>
     <l n="13">My hope , and thy derision ,</l>
     <l n="14">Florence Vane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">

   <p>THEODORE O'HARA ( 1820-1867 ) is chiefly remembered for a single poem that has touched the national heart . He was born in Danville , Kentucky . After taking a course in law , he accepted a clerkship in the Treasury Department at Washington . On the outbreak of the Mexican War he enlisted as a private soldier , and by his gallant service rose to the rank of captain and major . After the close of the war he returned to Washington and engaged for a time in the practice of his profession . Later he became editor of the Mobile Register , and Frankfort Yeoman in Kentucky . In the Civil War he served as colonel in the Confederate army .</p>
   <p>The poem on which his fame largely rests is The Bivouac of the Dead . It was written to commemorate the Kentuckians who fell in the battle of Buena Vista . Its well-known lines have furnished an apt inscription for several military cemeteries :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The muffled drum 's sad roll has beat</l>
     <l n="2">The soldier 's last tattoo ;</l>
     <l n="3">No more on Life 's parade shall meet</l>
     <l n="4">That brave and fallen few .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ On Fame 's eternal camping-ground</l>
     <l n="6">Their silent tents are spread ,</l>
     <l n="7">And Glory guards , with solemn round ,</l>
     <l n="8">The bivouac of the dead . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>O'Hara died in Alabama in 1867 . The legislature of Kentucky paid him a fitting tribute in having his body removed to Frankfort and placed by the side of the heroes whom he so worthily commemorated in his famous poem .</p>
   <p>FRANCIS ORRERY TICKNOR ( 1822-1874 ) was a physician living near Columbus , Georgia . He led a busy , useful , humble life , and his merits as a poet have not been fully recognized . In the opinion of Paul Hamilton Hayne , who edited a volume of Ticknor 's poems , he was “ one of the truest and sweetest lyric poets this country has yet produced . ” The Virginians of the Valley was written after the soldiers of the Old Dominion , many of whom bore the names of the knights of the “ Golden Horseshoe , ” had obtained a temporary advantage over the invading forces of the North :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ We thought they slept !— the sons who kept</l>
     <l n="2">The names of noble sires ,</l>
     <l n="3">And slumbered while the darkness crept</l>
     <l n="4">Around their vigil fires ;</l>
     <l n="5">But aye the ‘ Golden Horseshoe ’ knights</l>
     <l n="6">Their Old Dominion keep ,</l>
     <l n="7">Whose foes have found enchanted ground ,</l>
     <l n="8">But not a knight asleep . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But a martial lyric of greater force is Little Giffen , written in honor of a blue-eyed lad of East Tennessee . He was terribly wounded in some engagement , and after being taken to the hospital at Columbus , Georgia , was finally nursed back to life in the home of Dr. Ticknor . Beneath the thin , insignificant exterior of the lad , the poet discerned the incarnate courage of the hero :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Out of the focal and foremost fire ,</l>
     <l n="2">Out of the hospital walls as dire ;</l>
     <l n="3">Smitten of grape-shot and gangrene ,</l>
     <l n="4">( Eighteenth battle and he sixteen ! )</l>
     <l n="5">Specter ! such as you seldom see ,</l>
     <l n="6">Little Giffen of Tennessee !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">“ Word of gloom from the war , one day ;</l>
     <l n="8">Johnson pressed at the front , they say .</l>
     <l n="9">Little Giffen was up and away ;</l>
     <l n="10">A tear — his first — as he bade good-by ,</l>
     <l n="11">Dimmed the glint of his steel-blue eye .</l>
     <l n="12">‘ I 'll write , if spared ! ’ There was news of the fight ;</l>
     <l n="13">But none of Giffen .— He did not write . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But Ticknor did not confine himself to war themes . He was a lover of Nature ; and its forms , and colors , and sounds — as seen in April Morning , Twilight , The Hills , Among the Birds — appealed to his sensitive nature . Shut out from literary centers and literary companionship , he sang , like Burns , from the strong impulse awakened by the presence of the heroic and the beautiful .</p>
   <p>JOHN R. THOMPSON ( 1823-1873 ) has deserved well of the South both as editor and author . He was born in Richmond , and educated at the University of Virginia , where he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1845 . Two years later he became editor of the Southern Literary Messenger ; and during the twelve years of his editorial management , he not only maintained a high degree of literary excellence , but took pains to lend encouragement to Southern letters . It is a misfortune to our literature that his writings , particularly his poetry , have never been collected .</p>
   <p>The incidents of the Civil War called forth many a stirring lyric , the best of which is his well-known Music in Camp :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Two armies covered hill and plain ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where Rappahannock 's waters</l>
     <l n="3">Ran deeply crimsoned with the stain</l>
     <l n="4">Of battle 's recent slaughters . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The band had played “ Dixie ” and “ Yankee Doodle , ” which in turn had been</l>
     <l n="6">greeted with shouts by “ Rebels ” and “ Yanks . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">“ And yet once more the bugles sang</l>
     <l n="8">Above the stormy riot ;</l>
     <l n="9">No shout upon the evening rang —</l>
     <l n="10">There reigned a holy quiet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="11">“ The sad , slow stream its noiseless flood</l>
     <l n="12">Poured o'er the glistening pebbles ;</l>
     <l n="13">All silent now the Yankees stood ,</l>
     <l n="14">And silent stood the Rebels .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="15">“ No unresponsive soul had heard</l>
     <l n="16">That plaintive note 's appealing ,</l>
     <l n="17">So deeply ‘ Home , Sweet Home ’ had stirred</l>
     <l n="18">The hidden founts of feeling .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="19">“ Or Blue or Gray , the soldier sees ,</l>
     <l n="20">As by the wand of fairy ,</l>
     <l n="21">The cottage ‘ neath the live-oak trees ,</l>
     <l n="22">The cabin by the prairie . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>On account of failing health , Thompson made a visit to Europe , where he spent several years , contributing from time to time to Blackwood 's Magazine and other English periodicals . On his return to America , he was engaged on the editorial staff of the New York Evening Post , with which he was connected till his death , in 1873 . He is buried in Hollywood cemetery at Richmond .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The city 's hum drifts o'er his grave ,</l>
     <l n="2">And green above the hollies wave</l>
     <l n="3">Their jagged leaves , as when a boy ,</l>
     <l n="4">On blissful summer afternoons ,</l>
     <l n="5">He came to sing the birds his runes ,</l>
     <l n="6">And tell the river of his joy . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The verse of Mrs. MARGARET J. PRESTON ( 1820-1897 ) rises above the commonplace both in sentiment and craftsmanship . She belongs , as some critic has said , to the school of Mrs. Browning ; and in range of subject and purity of sentiment she is scarcely inferior to her great English contemporary . She was the daughter of the Rev . George Junkin , D. D ., the founder of Lafayette College , Pennsylvania , and for many years president of Washington College at Lexington , Virginia . In 1857 she married Colonel J. T. L. Preston of the Virginia Military Institute .</p>
   <p>For many years she was a contributor to the Southern Literary Messenger , in which her earlier poems first made their appearance . Though a native of Philadelphia , she was loyal to the South during the Civil War , and found inspiration in its deeds of heroism . Beechenbrook is a rhyme of the war ; and though well-nigh forgotten now , it was read , on its publication in 1865 , from the Potomac to the Gulf . Among her other writings are Old Songs and New and Cartoons . Her poetry is pervaded by a deeply religious spirit , and she repeatedly urges the lesson of supreme resignation and trust , as in the following lines :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ What will it matter by-and-by</l>
     <l n="2">Whether my path below was bright ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whether it wound through dark or light ,</l>
     <l n="4">Under a gray or golden sky ,</l>
     <l n="5">When I look back on it , by-and-by ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">“ What will it matter by-and-by</l>
     <l n="7">Whether , unhelped , I toiled alone ,</l>
     <l n="8">Dashing my foot against a stone ,</l>
     <l n="9">Missing the charge of the angel nigh ,</l>
     <l n="10">Bidding me think of the by-and-by ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">“ What will it matter ? Naught , if I</l>
     <l n="12">Only am sure the way I 've trod ,</l>
     <l n="13">Gloomy or gladdened , leads to God ,</l>
     <l n="14">Questioning not of the how , the why ,</l>
     <l n="15">If I but reach Him by-and-by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">“ What will I care for the unshared sigh ,</l>
     <l n="17">If in my fear of lapse or fall ,</l>
     <l n="18">Close I have clung to Christ through all ,</l>
     <l n="19">Mindless how rough the road might lie ,</l>
     <l n="20">Sure He will smoothen it by-and-by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">“ What will it matter by-and-by ?</l>
     <l n="22">Nothing but this : that Joy or Pain</l>
     <l n="23">Lifted me skyward ,— helped me to gain ,</l>
     <l n="24">Whether through rack , or smile , or sigh ,</l>
     <l n="25">Heaven , home , all in all , by-and-by . ”</l>

   <p>In this rapid sketch of the minor singers of the South , it has been necessary to omit many names worthy of mention . It is beyond our scope to speak of the newer race of poets . Here and there delicate notes are heard , but there is no evidence that a great singer is present among us . Yet there is no ground for discouragement ; the changed conditions and the new spirit that has come upon our people may reasonably be expected to lead to higher poetic achievement .</p>
   <p>In some respects the South affords a more promising field for literature than any other part of our country . There is evident decadence in New England . But the climate and scenery , the history and traditions , and the chivalrous spirit and unexhausted intellectual energies of the South contain the promise of an Augustan age in literature . In no insignificant degree its rich-ored veins have been worked in prose . JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS has successfully wrought in the mine of negro folk-lore ; GEORGE W. CABLE has portrayed the Creole life of Louisiana ; CHARLES EGBERT CRADDOCK has pictured the types of character found among the Tennessee mountains ; THOMAS NELSON PAGE has shown us the trials and triumphs of Reconstruction days ; and Miss MARY JOHNSTON has revived the picturesque scenes of colonial times . There has been an obvious literary awakening in the South ; and sooner or later it will find utterance , let us hope , in some strong-voiced , great-souled singer .</p>
   <p>It is true that there are obstacles to be overcome . There are no literary magazines in the South to encourage and develop our native talent as in the days of the Southern Literary Messenger . Southern writers are still dependent upon Northern periodicals , in which they can hardly be said to find a cordial welcome . It seems that the South in a measure suffers the obloquy that rested of old upon Nazareth , from which the Pharisees of the metropolis maintained that no good thing could come .</p>
   <p>But the most serious drawback of all is the disfavor into which poetry has fallen , or rather which it has brought upon itself . In the remoteness of its themes and sentiments , in its over-anxiety for a faultless or striking technique , it has erected a barrier between itself and the sanity of a practical , truth-loving people . Let us hope that this aberration is not permanent . When poetry returns to simplicity , sincerity , and truth ; when it shall voice , as in the great English singers , Tennyson and Browning , the deepest thought and aspirations of our race ; when once more , as in the prophetic days of old , it shall resume its lofty , seer-like office ,— then will it be restored to its place of honor by a delighted and grateful people .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER II</p>
   <p>EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>
   <p>Poe occupies a peculiar place in American literature . He has been called our most interesting literary man . He stands alone for his intellectual brilliancy and his lamentable failure to use it wisely . No one can read his works intelligently without being impressed with his extraordinary ability . Whether poetry , criticism , or fiction , he shows extraordinary power in them all . But the moral element in life is the most important , and in this Poe was lacking . With him truth was not the first necessity . He allowed his judgment to be warped by friendship , and apparently sacrificed sincerity to the vulgar desire of gaining popular applause . Through intemperate habits , he was unable for any considerable length of time to maintain himself in a responsible or lucrative position . Fortune repeatedly opened to him an inviting door ; but he constantly and ruthlessly abused her kindness .</p>
   <p>Edgar Allan Poe descended from an honorable ancestry . His grandfather , David Poe , was a Revolutionary hero , over whose grave , as he kissed the sod , Lafayette pronounced the words , “ Ici repose un coeur noble . ” His father , an impulsive and wayward youth , fell in love with an English actress , and forsook the bar for the stage . The couple were duly married , and acted with moderate success in the principal towns and cities of the country . It was during an engagement at Boston that the future poet was born , January 19 , 1809 . Two years later the wandering pair were again in Richmond , where within a few weeks of each other they died in poverty . They left three children , the second of whom , Edgar , was kindly received into the home of Mr. John Allan , a wealthy merchant of the city .</p>

    <p>EDGAR ALLAN POE .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The early training of Poe was misguided and unfortunate . The boy was remarkably pretty and precocious , and his foster-parents allowed no opportunity to pass without showing him off . After dinner in this elegant and hospitable home , he was frequently placed upon the table to drink to the health of the guests , and to deliver short declamations , for which he had inherited a decided talent . He was flattered and fondled and indulged in every way . Is it strange that under this training he acquired a taste for strong drink , and became opinionated and perverse ?</p>
   <p>In 1815 Mr. Allan went to England with his family to spend several years , and there placed the young Edgar at school in an ancient and historic town , which has since been swallowed up in the overflow of the great metropolis . The venerable appearance and associations of the town , as may be learned from the autobiographic tale of William Wilson , made a deep and lasting impression on the imaginative boy .</p>
   <p>After five years spent in this English school , where he learned to read Latin and to speak French , he was brought back to America , and placed in a Richmond academy . Without much diligence in study , his brilliancy enabled him to take high rank in his classes . His skill in verse-making and in debate made him prominent in the school . He excelled in athletic exercises , but was not generally popular among his fellow-students . Conscious of his superior intellectual endowments , he was disposed to live apart and indulge in moody reverie . According to the testimony of one who knew him well at this time , he was “ self-willed , capricious , inclined to be imperious , and though of generous impulses , not steadily kind , or even amiable . ”</p>
   <p>In 1826 , at the age of seventeen , Poe matriculated at the University of Virginia , and entered the schools of ancient and modern languages . Though he attended his classes with a fair degree of regularity , he was not slow in joining the fast set . Gambling seems to have become a passion with him , and he lost heavily . His reckless expenditures led Mr. Allan to visit Charlottesville for the purpose of inquiring into his habits . The result appears not to have been satisfactory ; and though his adopted son won high honors in Latin and French , Mr. Allan refused to allow him to return to the university after the close of his first session , and placed him in his own counting-room .</p>
   <p>It is not difficult to foresee the next step in the drama before us . Many a genius of far greater self-restraint and moral earnestness has found the routine of business almost intolerably irksome . With high notions of his own ability , and with a temper rebellious to all restraint , Poe soon broke away from his new duties , and started out to seek his fortune . He went to Boston ; and , in eager search for fame and money , he resorted to the rather unpromising expedient of publishing , in 1827 , a small volume of poems . Viewed in the light of his subsequent career , the volume gives here and there an intimation of the author 's genius ; but , as was to be expected , it attracted but little attention . He was soon reduced to financial straits , and in his pressing need he enlisted , under an assumed name , in the United States army . He served at Fort Moultrie , and afterward at Fortress Monroe . He rose to the rank of sergeant major ; and , according to the testimony of his superiors , he was “ exemplary in his deportment , prompt and faithful in the discharge of his duties . ”</p>
   <p>In 1829 , when his heart was softened by the death of his wife , Mr. Allan became reconciled to his adopted but wayward son . Through his influence , young Poe secured a discharge from the army , and obtained an appointment as cadet at West Point . He entered the military academy July 1 , 1830 , and , as usual , established a reputation for brilliancy and folly . He was reserved , exclusive , discontented , and censorious . As described by a classmate , “ He was an accomplished French scholar , and had a wonderful aptitude for mathematics , so that he had no difficulty in preparing his recitations in his class , and in obtaining the highest marks in these departments . He was a devourer of books ; but his great fault was his neglect of and apparent contempt for military duties . His wayward and capricious temper made him at times utterly oblivious or indifferent to the ordinary routine of roll call , drills , and guard duties . These habits subjected him often to arrest and punishment , and effectually prevented his learning or discharging the duties of a soldier . ” The final result may be easily anticipated : at the end of six months , he was summoned before a court-martial , tried , and expelled .</p>
   <p>Before leaving West Point , Poe arranged for the publication of a volume of poetry , which appeared in New York in 1831 . This volume , to which the students of the academy subscribed liberally in advance , is noteworthy in several particulars . In a prefatory letter Poe lays down the poetic principle to which he endeavored to conform his productions . It throws much light on his poetry by exhibiting the ideal at which he aimed . “ A poem , in my opinion , ” he says , “ is opposed to a work of science by having for its immediate object pleasure , not truth ; to romance , by having for its object an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure , being a poem only so far as this object is attained ; romance presenting perceptible images with definite , poetry with in definite sensations , to which end music is an essential , since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception . Music , when combined with a pleasurable idea , is poetry ; music without the idea is simply music ; the idea without the music is prose from its very definiteness . ” Music embodied in a golden mist of thought and sentiment — this is Poe 's poetic ideal .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The two principal poems in the volume under consideration — Al Aaraaf and Tamerlane — are obvious imitations of Moore and Byron . The beginning of Al Aaraaf , for example , might easily be mistaken for an extract from Lalla Rookh , so similar are the rhythm and rhyme :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ O ! nothing earthly save the ray</l>
     <l n="2">( Thrown back from flowers ) of Beauty 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="3">As in those gardens where the day</l>
     <l n="4">Springs from the gems of Circassy —</l>
     <l n="5">O ! nothing earthly save the thrill</l>
     <l n="6">Of melody in woodland rill —</l>
     <l n="7">Or ( music of the passion-hearted )</l>
     <l n="8">Joy 's voice so peacefully departed</l>
     <l n="9">That , like the murmur in the shell ,</l>
     <l n="10">Its echo dwelleth and will dwell —</l>
     <l n="11">Oh , nothing of the dross of ours —</l>
     <l n="12">Yet all the beauty — all the flowers</l>
     <l n="13">That list our Love , and deck our bowers —</l>
     <l n="14">Adorn yon world afar , afar —</l>
     <l n="15">The wandering star . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>After his expulsion from West Point , Poe appears to have gone to Richmond ; but the long-suffering of Mr. Allan , who had married again after the death of his first wife , was at length exhausted . He refused to extend any further recognition to one whom he had too much reason to regard as unappreciative and undeserving . Accordingly Poe was thrown upon his own resources for a livelihood . He settled in Baltimore , where he had a few acquaintances and friends , and entered upon that literary career which is without parallel in American literature for its achievements , its vicissitudes , and its sorrows . With no qualification for the struggle of life other than intellectual brilliancy , he bitterly atoned , through disappointment and suffering , for his defects of temper , lack of judgment , and habits of intemperance .</p>
   <p>In 1833 the Baltimore Saturday Visitor offered a prize of one hundred dollars for the best prose story . This prize Poe won by his tale , A Ms. Found in a Bottle . This success may be regarded as the first step in his literary career . The ability displayed in this fantastic tale brought him to the notice of John P. Kennedy , Esq ., who at once befriended him in his distress , and aided him in his literary projects . He gave Poe , whom he found in extreme poverty , free access to his home and , to use his own words , “ brought him up from the very verge of despair . ”</p>
   <p>After a year or more of hack work in Baltimore , Poe , through the influence of his kindly patron , obtained employment on the Southern Literary Messenger , and removed to Richmond in 1835 . Here he made a brilliant start ; life seemed to open before him full of promise . In a short time he was promoted to the editorship of the Messenger , and by his tales , poems , and especially his reviews , he made that periodical very popular . In a twelve-month he increased its subscription list from seven hundred to nearly five thousand , and made the magazine a rival of the Knickerbocker and the New Englander . He was loudly praised by the Southern press , and was generally regarded as one of the foremost writers of the day .</p>
   <p>In the Messenger Poe began his work as a critic . It is hardly necessary to say that his criticism was of the slashing kind . He became little short of a terror . With a great deal of critical acumen and a fine artistic sense , he made relentless war on pretentious mediocrity , and rendered good service to American letters by enforcing higher literary standards . He was lavish in his charges of plagiarism ; and he made use of cheap , second-hand learning in order to ridicule the pretended scholarship of others . He often affected an irritating and contemptuous superiority . But with all his humbug and superciliousness , his critical estimates , in the main , have been sustained .</p>
   <p>The bright prospects before Poe were in a few months ruthlessly blighted . Perhaps he relied too much on his genius and reputation . It is easy for men of ability to overrate their importance . Regarding himself , perhaps , as indispensable to the Messenger , he may have relaxed in vigilant self-restraint . It has been claimed that he resigned the editorship in order to accept a more lucrative offer in New York ; but the sad truth seems to be that he was dismissed on account of his irregular habits .</p>
   <p>After eighteen months in Richmond , during which he had established a brilliant literary reputation , Poe was again turned adrift . He went to New York , where his story , The Adventures of Arthur Gordon Pym , was published by the Harpers in 1838 . It is a tale of the sea , written with the simplicity of style and circumstantiality of detail that give such charm to the works of Defoe . In spite of the fact that Cooper and Marryat had created a taste for sea-tales , this story never became popular . It is superabundant in horrors — a vein that had a fatal fascination for the morbid genius of Poe .</p>
   <p>The same year in which this story appeared , Poe removed to Philadelphia , where he soon found work on the Gentleman 's Magazine , recently established by the comedian Burton . He soon rose to the position of editor-in-chief , and his talents proved of great value to the magazine . His tales and critiques rapidly increased its circulation . But the actor , whose love of justice does him great credit , could not approve of his editor 's sensational criticism . In a letter written when their cordial relations were interrupted for a time , Burton speaks very plainly and positively : “ I cannot permit the magazine to be made a vehicle for that sort of severity which you think is so ‘ successful with the mob . I am truly much less anxious about making a monthly ‘ sensation ’ than I am upon the point of fairness .... You say the people love havoc . I think they love justice . ” Poe did not profit by his experience at Richmond , and after a few months he was dismissed for neglect of duty .</p>
   <p>He was out of employment but a short time . In November , 1840 , Graham 's Magazine was established , and Poe appointed editor . At no other period of his life did his genius appear to better advantage . Thrilling stories and trenchant criticisms followed one another in rapid succession . His articles on autography and cryptology attracted widespread attention . In the former he attempted to illustrate character by the handwriting ; and in the latter he maintained that human ingenuity cannot invent a cipher that human ingenuity cannot resolve . In the course of a few months the circulation of the magazine ( if its own statements may be trusted ) increased from eight thousand to forty thousand — a remarkable circulation for that time .</p>
   <p>His criticism was based on the rather violent assumption “ that , as a literary people , we are one vast perambulating humbug . ” In most cases , he asserted , literary prominence was achieved “ by the sole means of a blustering arrogance , or of a busy wriggling conceit , or of the most bare-faced plagiarism , or even through the simple immensity of its assumptions . ” These fraudulent reputations he undertook , “ with the help of a hearty good will ” ( which no one will doubt ) “ to tumble down . ” He admitted that there were a few who rose above absolute “ idiocy . ” “ Mr. Bryant is not all a fool . Mr. Willis is not quite an ass . Mr. Longfellow will steal but , perhaps , he cannot help it ( for we have heard of such things ) , and then it must not be denied that nil tetigit quod non ornavit . ” But , in spite of such reckless and extravagant assertion , there was still too much acumen and force in his reviews for them to be treated with indifference or contempt .</p>
   <p>In about eighteen months Poe 's connection with Graham was dissolved . The reason has not been made perfectly clear ; but from what we already know , it is safe to charge it to Poe 's infirmity of temper or of habit . His protracted sojourn in Philadelphia was now drawing to a close . It had been the most richly productive , as well as the happiest , period of his life . For a time , sustained by appreciation and hope , he in a measure overcame his intemperate habits . Griswold , his much-abused biographer , has given us an interesting description of him and his home at this time : “ His manner , except during his fits of intoxication , was very quiet and gentlemanly ; he was usually dressed with simplicity and elegance ; and when once he sent for me to visit him , during a period of illness caused by protracted and anxious watching at the side of his sick wife , I was impressed by the singular neatness and the air of refinement in his home . It was in a small house , in one of the pleasant and silent neighborhoods far from the center of the town ; and , though slightly and cheaply furnished , everything in it was so tasteful and so fitly disposed that it seemed altogether suitable for a man of genius . ”</p>
   <p>It was during his residence in Philadelphia that Poe wrote his choicest stories . Among the masterpieces of this period are to be mentioned The Fall of the House of Usher , Ligeia , which he regarded as his best tale The Descent into the Maelstrom , The Murders in the Rue Morgue , and The Mystery of Marie Roget . The general character of his tales may be inferred from their titles . Poe delighted in the weird , fantastic , dismal , horrible . There is no warmth of human sympathy , no moral consciousness , no lessons of practical wisdom . His tales are the product of a morbid but powerful imagination . His style is in perfect keeping with his peculiar gifts . He had a highly developed artistic sense . By his air of perfect candor , his minuteness of detail , and his power of graphic description , he gains complete mastery over the soul , and leads us almost to believe the impossible . Within the limited range of his imagination ( for he was by no means the universal genius he fancied himself to be ) he is unsurpassed , perhaps , by any other American writer .</p>
   <p>Poe 's career had now reached its climax , and after a time began its rapid descent . In 1844 he moved to New York , where for a year or two his life did not differ materially from what it had been in Philadelphia . He continued to write his fantastic tales , for which he was poorly paid , and to do editorial work , by which he eked out a scanty livelihood . He was employed by N. P. Willis for a few months on the Evening Mirror as sub-editor and critic , and was regularly “ at his desk from nine in the morning till the paper went to press . ”</p>
   <p>It was in this paper , January 29 , 1845 , that his greatest poem , The Raven , was published with a flattering commendation by Willis . It laid hold of the popular fancy ; and , copied throughout the length and breadth of the land , it met a reception never before accorded to an American poem . Abroad its success was scarcely less remarkable and decisive . “ This vivid writing , ” wrote Mrs. Browning , “ this power which is felt , has produced a sensation here in England . Some of my friends are taken by the fear of it , and some by the music . I hear of persons who are haunted by the ‘ Nevermore ’ ; and an acquaintance of mine , who has the misfortune of possessing a bust of Pallas , cannot bear to look at it in the twilight . ”</p>
   <p>In 1845 Poe was associated with the management of the Broadway Journal , which in a few months passed entirely into his hands . He had long desired to control a periodical of his own , and in Philadelphia had tried to establish a magazine . But , however brilliant as an editor , he was not a man of administrative ability ; and in three months he was forced to suspend publication for want of means . Shortly afterward he published in Godey 's Lady 's Book a series of critical papers entitled Literati of New York . The papers , usually brief , are gossipy , interesting , sensational , with an occasional lapse into contemptuous and exasperating severity .</p>
   <p>In the same year he published a tolerably complete edition of his poems in the revised form in which they now appear in his works . The volume contained nearly all the poems upon which his poetic fame justly rests . Among those that may be regarded as embodying his highest poetic achievement are The Raven , Lenore , Ulalume , The Bells , Annabel Lee , The Haunted Palace , The Conqueror Worm , The City in the Sea , Eulalie , and Israfel . Rarely has so large a fame rested on so small a number of poems , and rested so securely . His range of themes , it will be noticed , is very narrow . As in his tales , he dwells in a weird , fantastic , or desolate region — usually under the shadow of death . He conjures up unearthly landscapes as a setting for his gloomy and morbid fancies . In The City in the Sea , for example :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ There shrines and palaces and towers</l>
     <l n="2">( Time-eaten towers that tremble not ! )</l>
     <l n="3">Resemble nothing that is ours .</l>
     <l n="4">Around , by lifting winds forgot ,</l>
     <l n="5">Resignedly beneath the sky</l>
     <l n="6">The melancholy waters lie . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He conformed his poetic efforts to his theory that a poem should be short . He maintained that the phrase “ ‘ a long poem ’ is simply a flat contradiction in terms . ” His strong artistic sense gave him a firm mastery over form . He constantly uses alliteration , assonance , repetition , and refrain . These artifices form an essential part of The Raven , Lenore , and The Bells . In his poems , as in his tales , Poe was less anxious to set forth an experience or a truth than to make an impression . His poetry aims at beauty in a purely artistic sense , unassociated with truth or morals . It is , for the most part , singularly vague , unsubstantial , and melodious . Some of his poems — and precisely those in which his genius finds its highest expression — defy complete analysis . Ulalume , for instance , remains obscure after the twentieth perusal — its meaning lost in a haze of mist and music . Yet these poems , when read in a sympathetic mood , never fail of their effect . They are genuine creations ; and , as a fitting expression of certain mental states , they possess an indescribable charm , something like the spell of the finest instrumental music . There is no mistaking Poe 's poetic genius . Though not the greatest , he is still the most original , of our poets , and has fairly earned the high esteem in which his gifts are held in America and Europe .</p>
   <p>During his stay in New York , Poe was often present in the literary gatherings of the metropolis . He was sometimes accompanied by his sweet , affectionate , invalid wife , whom in her fourteenth year he had married in Richmond . According to Griswold , “ His conversation was at times almost supramortal in its eloquence . His voice was modulated with astonishing skill ; and his large and variably expressive eyes looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who listened , while his own face glowed , or was changeless in pallor , as his imagination quickened his blood or drew it back frozen to his heart . ” His writings are unstained by a single immoral sentiment .</p>
   <p>Toward the latter part of his sojourn in New York , the hand of poverty and want pressed upon him sorely . The failing health of his wife , to whom his tender devotion is beyond all praise , was a source of deep and constant anxiety . For a time he became an object of charity — a humiliation that was exceedingly galling to his delicately sensitive nature . To a sympathetic friend , who lent her kindly aid in this time of need , we owe a graphic but pathetic picture of Poe 's home shortly before the death of his almost angelic wife : “ There was no clothing on the bed , which was only straw , but a snow-white counterpane and sheets . The weather was cold , and the sick lady had the dreadful chills that accompany the hectic fever of consumption . She lay on the straw bed , wrapped in her husband 's great-coat , with a large tortoise-shell cat in her bosom . The wonderful cat seemed conscious of her great usefulness . The coat and the cat were the sufferer 's only means of warmth , except as her husband held her hands , and her mother her feet . ” She died January 30 , 1847 .</p>
   <p>After this event Poe was never entirely himself again . The immediate effect of his bereavement was complete physical and mental prostration , from which he recovered only with difficulty . His subsequent literary work deserves scarcely more than mere mention . His Eureka , an ambitious treatise , the immortality of which he confidently predicted , was a disappointment and failure . He tried lecturing , but with only moderate success . His correspondence at this time reveals a broken , hysterical , hopeless man . In his weakness , loneliness , and sorrow , he resorted to stimulants with increasing frequency . Their terrible work was soon done . On his return from a visit to Richmond , he stopped in Baltimore , where he died from the effects of drinking , October 7 , 1849 .</p>
   <p>Thus ended the tragedy of his life . It is as depressing as one of his own morbid , fantastic tales . His career leaves a painful sense of incompleteness and loss . With greater self-discipline , how much more he might have accomplished for himself and for others ! Gifted , self-willed , proud , passionate , with meager moral sense , he forfeited success by his perversity and his vices . From his own character and experience he drew the unhealthy and pessimistic views to which he has given expression in the maddening poem , The Conqueror Worm . And if there were not happier and nobler lives , we might well say with him , as we stand by his grave :—</p>

   <p>CHAPTER III</p>
   <p>PAUL HAMILTON HAYNE</p>
   <p>The poetry of Paul Hamilton Hayne is characterized by a singular delicacy of sentiment and expression . There is an utter absence of what is gross or commonplace . His poetry , as a whole , carries with it an atmosphere of high-bred refinement . We recognize at once fineness of fiber and of culture . It could not well be otherwise ; for the poet traced the line of his ancestors to the cultured nobility of England , and , surrounded by wealth , was brought up in the home of Southern chivalry .</p>
   <p>The aristocratic lineage of the Hayne family was not reflected in its political feelings and affiliations in this country . They were not Tories ; on the contrary , from the colonial days down to the Civil War they showed themselves stoutly democratic . The Haynes were , in a measure , to South Carolina what the Adamses and Quincys were to Massachusetts . A chivalrous uncle of the poet , Colonel Arthur P. Hayne , fought in three wars , and afterwards entered the United States Senate . Another uncle , Governor Robert Y. Hayne , was a distinguished statesman , who did not fear to cross swords with Webster in the most famous debate , perhaps , of our national history . The poet 's father was a lieutenant in the United States navy , and died at sea when his gifted son was still an infant . These patriotic antecedents were not without influence on the life and writings of the poet .</p>
   <p>In the existing biographical sketches of Hayne we find little or no mention of his mother . This neglect is undeserved . She was a cultured woman of good English and Scotch ancestry . It was her hand that had the chief fashioning of the young poet 's mind and heart . She transmitted to him his poetic temperament ; and when his muse began its earliest flights , she encouraged him with appreciative words and ambitious hopes . Hayne 's poems are full of autobiographic elements ; and in one , entitled To My Mother , he says :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ To thee my earliest verse I brought ,</l>
     <l n="2">All wreathed in loves and roses ,</l>
     <l n="3">Some glowing boyish fancy , fraught</l>
     <l n="4">With tender May-wind closes ;</l>
     <l n="5">Thou didst not taunt my fledgling song ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nor view its flight with scorning :</l>
     <l n="7">‘ The bird , ’ thou saidst , ‘ grown fleet and strong ,</l>
     <l n="8">Might yet outsoar the morning ! ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Paul Hamilton Hayne was born in Charleston , South Carolina , January 1 , 1830 . At that time Charleston was the literary center of the South . Among its wealthy and aristocratic circles there , was a literary group of unusual gifts . Calhoun and Legaré were there ; and William Gilmore Simms , a man of great versatility , gathered about him a congenial literary circle , in which we find Hayne and his scarcely less distinguished friend , Henry Timrod .</p>
   <p>Hayne was graduated with distinction from Charleston College in 1850 , receiving a prize for superiority in English composition and elocution . He then studied law ; but , like many other authors both North and South , the love of letters proved too strong for the practice of his profession . His literary bent , as with most of our gifted authors , manifested itself early , and even in his college days he became a devotee of the poetic muse . The ardor of his devotion found expression in one of his early poems , first called Aspirations , but in his later works appearing under the title of The Will and the Wing :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Yet would I rather in the outward state</l>
     <l n="2">Of Song 's immortal temple lay me down ,</l>
     <l n="3">A beggar basking by that radiant gate ,</l>
     <l n="4">Than bend beneath the haughtiest empire 's crown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ For sometimes , through the bars , my ravished eyes</l>
     <l n="6">Have caught brief glimpses of a life divine ,</l>
     <l n="7">And seen a far , mysterious rapture rise</l>
     <l n="8">Beyond the veil that guards the inmost shrine . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Hayne served his literary apprenticeship in connection with several periodicals . He was a favorite contributor to the Southern Literary Messenger , for many years published in Richmond , Virginia , and deservedly ranking as the best monthly issued in the South before the Civil War . He was one of the editors of the Southern Literary Gazette , a weekly published in his native city . Afterwards , as a result of a plan devised at one of Simms 's literary dinners , Russell 's Magazine , with Hayne as editor , was established , to use the language of the first number , as “ another depository for Southern genius , and a new incentive , as we hope , for its active exercise . ” It was a monthly of high excellence for the time ; but for lack of adequate support it suspended publication after an honorable career of two years .</p>
   <p>An article in Russell 's Magazine for August , 1857 , elaborately discusses the ante-bellum discouragements to authorship in the South . Indifference , ignorance , and prejudice , the article asserted , were encountered on every hand . “ It may happen to be only a volume of noble poetry , full of those universal thoughts and feelings which speak , not to a particular people , but to all mankind . It is censured , at the South , as not sufficiently Southern in spirit , while at the North it is pronounced a very fair specimen of Southern commonplace . Both North and South agree with one mind to condemn the author and forget his book . ”</p>
   <p>Hayne 's critical work as editor of Russell 's Magazine is worthy of note . In manly independence of judgment , though not in ferocity of style , he resembled Poe . He prided himself on conscientious loyalty to literary art . He disclaimed all sympathy with that sectional spirit which has sometimes lauded a work merely for geographical reasons ; and in the critical reviews of his magazine he did not hesitate to point out and censure crudeness in Southern writers . But , at the same time , it was a more pleasing task to his generous nature to recognize and praise artistic excellence wherever he found it .</p>
   <p>As a critic Hayne was , perhaps , severest to himself . His poetic standards were high . In his maturer years he blamed the precipitancy with which , as a youth , he had rushed into print . There is an interesting marginal note , as his son tells us , in a copy of his first volume of verse , in which The Cataract is pronounced “ the poorest piece in the volume . Boyish and bombastic ! Should have been whipped for publishing it ! ” It is needless to say that the piece does not appear in his Complete Poems . This severity of self-criticism , which exacted sincerity of utterance , has imparted a rare average excellence to his work .</p>
   <p>In 1852 he married Miss Mary Middleton Michel , of Charleston , the daughter of a distinguished French physician . Rarely has a union been more happy . In the days of his prosperity she was an inspiration ; and in the long years of poverty and sickness that came later she was his comfort and stay . In his poem , The Bonny Brown Hand , there is a reflection of the love that glorified the toil and ills of this later period :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Oh , drearily , how drearily , the sombre eve comes down !</l>
     <l n="2">And wearily , how wearily , the seaboard breezes blow !</l>
     <l n="3">But place your little hand in mine — so dainty , yet so brown !</l>
     <l n="4">For household toil hath worn away its rosy-tinted snow ;</l>
     <l n="5">But I fold it , wife , the nearer ,</l>
     <l n="6">And I feel , my love , ‘ tis dearer</l>
     <l n="7">Than all dear things of earth ,</l>
     <l n="8">As I watch the pensive gloaming ,</l>
     <l n="9">And my wild thoughts cease from roaming ,</l>
     <l n="10">And birdlike furl their pinions close beside our peaceful hearth ;</l>
     <l n="11">Then rest your little hand in mine , while twilight shimmers down ,</l>
     <l n="12">That little hand , that fervent hand , that hand of bonny brown —</l>
     <l n="13">The hand that holds an honest heart , and rules a happy hearth . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Two small volumes of Hayne 's poetry appeared before the Civil War from the press of Ticknor &amp; Co ., Boston . They were made up chiefly of pieces contributed to the Southern Literary Messenger , Russsell 's Magazine , and other periodicals in the South . The first volume appeared in 1855 , and the second in 1859 . These volumes were well worthy of the favorable reception they met with , and encouraged the poet to dedicate himself more fully to his art . In the fullness of this dedication , he reminds us of Longfellow , Tennyson , and Wordsworth , all of whom he admired and loved .</p>
   <p>Few first volumes of greater excellence have ever appeared in this country . The judicious critic was at once able to recognize the presence of a genuine singer . The poet rises above the obvious imitation that was a common vice among Southern singers before the Civil War . We may indeed perceive the influence of Tennyson in the delicacy of the craftsmanship , and the influence of Wordsworth in the deep and sympathetic treatment of Nature ; but Hayne 's study of these great bards had been transmuted into poetic culture , and is reflected only in the superior quality of his work . There is no case of conscious or obvious imitation .</p>
   <p>The volume of 1859 , which bears the title Avolio and Other Poems , exhibits the poet 's fondness for the sonnet and his admirable skill in its use . Throughout his subsequent poetical career , he frequently chose the sonnet as the medium for expressing his choicest thought . It is hardly too much to claim that Hayne is the prince of American sonneteers . The late Maurice Thompson said that he could pick out twenty of Hayne 's sonnets equal to almost any others in our language . In the following sonnet , which is quoted by way of illustration , the poet gives us the key to a large part of his work . He was a worshiper of beauty ; and the singleness of this devotion gives him his distinctive place in our poetic annals .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Pent in this common sphere of sensual shows ,</l>
     <l n="2">I pine for beauty ; beauty of fresh mien ,</l>
     <l n="3">And gentle utterance , and the charm serene ,</l>
     <l n="4">Wherewith the hue of mystic dreamland glows ;</l>
     <l n="5">I pine for lulling music , the repose</l>
     <l n="6">Of low-voiced waters , in some realm between</l>
     <l n="7">The perfect Adenne , and this clouded scene</l>
     <l n="8">Of love 's sad loss , and passion 's mournful throes ;</l>
     <l n="9">A pleasant country , girt with twilight calm ,</l>
     <l n="10">In whose fair heaven a moon of shadowy round</l>
     <l n="11">Wades through a fading fall of sunset rain ;</l>
     <l n="12">Where drooping lotos-flowers , distilling balm ,</l>
     <l n="13">Gleam by the drowsy streamlets sleep hath crown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="14">While Care forgets to sigh , and Peace hath balsamed pain . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The great civil conflict of ‘ 61 - ‘ 65 naturally stirred the poet 's heart . He was a patriotic son of the South . On the breaking out of hostilities , he became a member of Governor Pickens 's staff , and was stationed for a time in Fort Sumter ; but after a brief service he was forced to resign on account of failing health . His principal service to the Southern cause was rendered in his martial songs , which breathe a lofty , patriotic spirit . They are remarkable at once for their dignity of manner and refinement of utterance . There is an entire absence of the fierceness that is to be found in some of Whittier 's and Timrod 's sectional lyrics . Hayne lacked the fierce energy of a great reformer or partisan leader . But nowhere else do we find a heart more sensitive to grandeur of achievement or pathos of incident . He recognized the unsurpassed heroism of sentiment and achievement displayed in the war ; and in an admirable sonnet , he exclaims :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Ah , foolish souls and false ! who loudly cried</l>
     <l n="2">‘ True chivalry no longer breathes in time . ’</l>
     <l n="3">Look round us now ; how wondrous , how sublime</l>
     <l n="4">The heroic lives we witness ; far and wide</l>
     <l n="5">Stern vows by sterner deeds are justified ;</l>
     <l n="6">Self-abnegation , calmness , courage , power ,</l>
     <l n="7">Sway , with a rule august , our stormy hour ,</l>
     <l n="8">Wherein the loftiest hearts have wrought and died —</l>
     <l n="9">Wrought grandly , and died smiling . Thus , O God ,</l>
     <l n="10">From tears , and blood , and anguish , thou hast brought</l>
     <l n="11">The ennobling act , the faith-sustaining thought —</l>
     <l n="12">Till , in the marvelous present , one may see</l>
     <l n="13">A mighty stage , by knights and patriots trod ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who had not shunned earth 's haughtiest chivalry . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The war brought the poet disaster . His beautiful home and the library he has celebrated in a noble sonnet were destroyed in the bombardment of Charleston . The family silver , which had been stored in Columbia for safe-keeping , was lost in Sherman 's famous “ march to the sea . ” His native state was in desolation ; his friends , warm and true with the fidelity which a common disaster brings , were generally as destitute and helpless as himself . Under these disheartening circumstances , rendered still more gloomy by the ruthless deeds of reconstruction , he withdrew to the pine barrens of Georgia , where , eighteen miles from Augusta , he built a very plain and humble cottage . He christened it Copse Hill ; and it was here , on a desk fashioned out of a workbench left by the carpenters , that many of his choicest pieces , reflecting credit on American letters , and earning for him a high place among American poets , were written .</p>
   <p>This modest home , which from its steep hillside —</p>
   <p>“ Catches morn 's earliest and eve 's latest glow , ” —</p>
   <p>the poet has commemorated in a sonnet , which gives us a glimpse of the quiet , rural scenes that were dear to his heart :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Here , far from worldly strife , and pompous show ,</l>
     <l n="2">The peaceful seasons glide serenely by ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fulfill their missions , and as calmly die ,</l>
     <l n="4">As waves on quiet shores when winds are low .</l>
     <l n="5">Fields , lonely paths , the one small glimmering rill</l>
     <l n="6">That twinkles like a wood-fay 's mirthful eye ,</l>
     <l n="7">Under moist bay leaves , clouds fantastical</l>
     <l n="8">That float and change at the light breeze 's will ,—</l>
     <l n="9">To me , thus lapped in sylvan luxury ,</l>
     <l n="10">Are more than death of kings , or empires ’ fall . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His son , Mr. W. H. Hayne , has thrown an interesting light upon the poet 's methods of composition . Physical movement seemed favorable to his poetic faculty ; and many of his pieces were composed as he paced to and fro in his study , or walked with stooping shoulders beneath the trees surrounding Copse Hill . He was not mechanical or systematic in his poetic work , but followed the impulse of inspiration . “ The poetic impulse , ” his son tells us , “ frequently came to him so spontaneously as to demand immediate utterance , and he would turn to the fly leaf of the book in hand or on a neighboring shelf , and his pencil would soon record the lines , or fragments of lines , that claimed release from his brain . The labor of revision usually followed ,— sometimes promptly , but not infrequently after the fervor of conception had passed away . ” The painstaking care with which the revising was done is revealed in the artistic finish of almost every poem .</p>
   <p>Hayne 's life at this time was truly heroic . With uncomplaining fortitude he met the hardships of poverty and bore the increasing ills of failing health . He never lost hope and courage . He lived the poetry that he sang :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Still smiles the brave soul , undivorced from hope ;</l>
     <l n="2">And , with unwavering eye and warrior mien ,</l>
     <l n="3">Walks in the shadow dauntless and serene ,</l>
     <l n="4">To test , through hostile years , the utmost scope</l>
     <l n="5">Of man 's endurance — constant , to essay</l>
     <l n="6">All heights of patience free to feet of clay . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And in the end he was not disappointed . Gradually his genius gained general recognition . The leading magazines of the country were opened to him ; and , as Stedman remarks , “ his people regarded him with a tenderness which , if a commensurate largess had been added , would have made him feel less solitary among his pines . ”</p>
   <p>In 1872 a volume of Legends and Lyrics was issued by Lippincott &amp; Co . It shows the poet 's genius in the full power of maturity . His legends are admirably told , and Aëthra is a gem of its kind . But the richness of Hayne 's imagination was better suited to lyric than to narrative or dramatic poetry . The latter , indeed , abounds in rare beauty of thought and expression ; but somehow this luxuriance seems to retard or obscure the movement . The lyric pieces of this volume are full of self - revelation , autobiography , and Southern landscape . Hayne was not an apostle of the strenuous life ; he preferred to dream among the beauties or sublimities of Nature . Thus , in Dolce far Niente , he says :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Let the world roll blindly on !</l>
     <l n="2">Give me shadow , give me sun ,</l>
     <l n="3">And a perfumed eve as this is :</l>
     <l n="4">Let me lie</l>
     <l n="5">Dreamfully ,</l>
     <l n="6">Where the last quick sunbeams shiver</l>
     <l n="7">Spears of light athwart the river ,</l>
     <l n="8">And a breeze , which seems the sigh</l>
     <l n="9">Of a fairy floating by ,</l>
     <l n="10">Coyly kisses</l>
     <l n="11">Tender leaf and feathered grasses ;</l>
     <l n="12">Yet so soft its breathing passes ,</l>
     <l n="13">These tall ferns , just glimmering o'er me ,</l>
     <l n="14">Blending goldenly before me ,</l>
     <l n="15">Hardly quiver ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The well-known friendship existing between Hayne and his brother poet Timrod was a beautiful one . As schoolboys they had encouraged each other in poetic efforts . As editor of Russell 's Magazine , Hayne had welcomed and praised Timrod 's contributions . For the edition of Timrod 's poems published in 1873 , Hayne prepared a generous and beautiful memoir , in which he quoted the opinion of some Northern writers who assigned the highest place to his friend among the poets of the South . In the Legends and Lyrics there is a fine poem , Under the Pine , commemorative of Timrod 's visit to Copse Hill shortly before his death :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ O Tree ! against thy mighty trunk he laid</l>
     <l n="2">His weary head ; thy shade</l>
     <l n="3">Stole o'er him like the first cool spell of sleep :</l>
     <l n="4">It brought a peace so deep ,</l>
     <l n="5">The unquiet passion died from out his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="6">As lightnings from stilled skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">“ And in that calm he loved to rest , and hear</l>
     <l n="8">The soft wind-angels , clear</l>
     <l n="9">And sweet , among the uppermost branches sighing :</l>
     <l n="10">Voices he heard replying</l>
     <l n="11">( Or so he dreamed ) far up the mystic height ,</l>
     <l n="12">And pinions rustling light . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>As illustrating his rich fancy and graphic power of diction , a few stanzas are given from Cloud Pictures . They are not unworthy of Tennyson in his happiest moments .</p>
   <lg>

   </lg>
   <p>In 1882 a complete edition of Hayne 's poems was published by D. Lothrop &amp; Co . Except a few poems written after that date and still uncollected , this edition contains his later productions , in which we discover an increasing seriousness , richness , and depth . The general range of subjects , as in his earlier volumes , is limited to his Southern environment and individual experience . This limitation is the severest charge that can be brought against his poetry , but , at the same time , it is an evidence of his sincerity and truth . He did not aspire , as did some of his great Northern contemporaries , to the office of moralist , philosopher , or reformer . He was content to dwell in the quiet realm of beauty as it appears , to use the words of Margaret J. Preston , in the “ aromatic freshness of the woods , the swaying incense of the cathedral - like isles of pines , the sough of dying summer winds , the glint of lonely pools , and the brooding notes of leaf-hidden mocking-birds . ” But the beauty and pathos of human life were not forgotten ; and now and then he touched upon the great spiritual truths on which the splendid heroism of his life was built . For delicacy of feeling and perfection of form , his meditative and religious poems deserve to rank among the best in our language . They contain what is so often lacking in poetry of this class , genuine poetic feeling and artistic expression .</p>
   <p>The steps of death approached gradually ; for , like two other great poets of the South , Timrod and Lanier , he was not physically strong . Though sustained through his declining years by “ the ultimate trust ” —</p>
   <p>“ That love and mercy , Father , still are thine , ” —</p>
   <p>he felt a pathetic desire to linger awhile in the love of his tender , patient , helpful wife :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ A little while I fain would linger here ;</l>
     <l n="2">Behold ! who knows what soul-dividing bars</l>
     <l n="3">Earth 's faithful loves may part in other stars ?</l>
     <l n="4">Nor can love deem the face of death is fair :</l>
     <l n="5">A little while I still would linger here . ”</l>

   <p>Paul Hamilton Hayne passed away July 6 , 1886 . As already brought out in the course of this sketch , he was not only a gifted singer , but also a noble man . His extraordinary poetic gifts have not yet been fully recognized . Less gifted singers have been placed above him . No biography has been written to record with fond minuteness the story of his admirable life and achievement . His writings in prose , and a few of his choicest lyrics , still remain unpublished . Let us hope that this reproach to Southern letters may soon be removed , and that this laureate of the South may yet come to the full inheritance of fame to which the children of genius are inalienably entitled .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
    <head>HENRY TIMROD</head>
    <head>In some respects there is a striking similarity in the lives of the three Southern poets , Hayne , Timrod , and Lanier . They were alike victims of misfortune , and in their greatest tribulations they exhibited the same heroic patience and fortitude .</head>
     <l n="1">“ They knew alike what suffering starts</l>
     <l n="2">From fettering need and ceaseless pain ;</l>
     <l n="3">But still with brave and cheerful hearts ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whose message hope and joy imparts ,</l>
     <l n="5">They sang their deathless strain . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The fate of Timrod was the saddest of them all . Gifted with uncommon genius , he never saw its full fruitage ; and over and over again , when some precious hope seemed about to be realized , it was cruelly dashed to the ground . There is , perhaps , no sadder story in the annals of literature .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Henry Timrod was born in Charleston , South Carolina , December 28 , 1829 .</l>
     <l n="2">He was older than his friend Hayne by twenty-three days . The law of</l>
     <l n="3">heredity seems to find exemplification in his genius . The Timrods , a</l>
     <l n="4">family of German descent , were long identified with the history of South</l>
     <l n="5">Carolina . The poet 's grandfather belonged to the German Fusiliers of</l>
     <l n="6">Charleston , a volunteer company organized in 1775 , after the battle of</l>
     <l n="7">Lexington , for the defense of the American colonies . In the Seminole War ,</l>
     <l n="8">the poet 's father , Captain William Henry Timrod , commanded the German</l>
     <l n="9">Fusiliers in Florida . He was a gifted man , whose talents attracted an</l>
     <l n="10">admiring circle of friends . “ By the simple mastery of genius , ” says</l>
     <l n="11">Hayne , “ he gained no trifling influence among the highest intellectual</l>
     <l n="12">and social circles of a city noted at that period for aristocratic</l>
     <l n="13">exclusiveness . ”</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="14">[ Illustration : HENRY TIMROD . ]</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Timrod 's father was not only an eloquent talker , but also a poet . A strong intellect was associated with delicate feelings . He had the gift of musical utterance ; and the following verses from his poem , To Time — the Old Traveler , were pronounced by Washington Irving equal to any lyric written by Tom Moore :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ They slander thee , Old Traveler ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who say that thy delight</l>
     <l n="3">Is to scatter ruin far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="4">In thy wantonness of might :</l>
     <l n="5">For not a leaf that falleth</l>
     <l n="6">Before thy restless wings ,</l>
     <l n="7">But in thy flight , thou changest it</l>
     <l n="8">To a thousand brighter things .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">“ ‘ Tis true thy progress layeth</l>
     <l n="10">Full many a loved one low ,</l>
     <l n="11">And for the brave and beautiful</l>
     <l n="12">Thou hast caused our tears to flow ;</l>
     <l n="13">But always near the couch of death</l>
     <l n="14">Nor thou , nor we can stay ;</l>
     <l n="15">And the breath of thy departing wings</l>
     <l n="16">Dries all our tears away ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>On his mother 's side the poet was scarcely less fortunate in his parentage . She was as beautiful in form and face as in character . From her more than from his father the poet derived his love of Nature . She delighted in flowers and trees and stars ; she caught the glintings of the sunshine through the leaves ; she felt a thrill of joy at the music of singing birds and of murmuring waters . With admirable maternal tenderness she taught her children to discern and appreciate the lovely sights and sounds of nature .</p>
   <p>Timrod received his early education in a Charleston school , where he sat next to Hayne . He was an ambitious boy , insatiable in his desire for knowledge ; at the same time , he was fond of outdoor sports , and enjoyed the respect and confidence of his companions . His poetic activity dates from this period . “ I well remember , ” says Hayne , “ the exultation with which he showed me one morning his earliest consecutive attempt at verse - making . Our down-East schoolmaster , however , could boast of no turn for sentiment , and having remarked us hobnobbing , meanly assaulted us in the rear , effectually quenching for the time all aesthetic enthusiasm . ”</p>
   <p>When sixteen or seventeen years of age he entered the University of Georgia . He was cramped for lack of means ; sickness interfered with his studies , and at length he was forced to leave the university without his degree . But his interrupted course was not in vain . His fondness for literature led him , not only to an intelligent study of Virgil , Horace , and Catullus , but also to an unusual acquaintance with the leading poets of England . His pen was not inactive , and some of his college verse , published over a fictitious signature in a Charleston paper , attracted local attention .</p>
   <p>After leaving college Timrod returned to Charleston , and entered upon the study of law in the office of the Hon . J. L. Petigru . But the law was not adapted to his tastes and talents , and , like Hayne , he early abandoned it to devote himself to literature . He was timid and retiring in disposition . “ His walk was quick and nervous , ” says Dr. J. Dickson Bruns , “ with an energy in it that betokened decision of character , but ill sustained by the stammering speech ; for in society he was the shyest and most undemonstrative of men . To a single friend whom he trusted , he would pour out his inmost heart ; but let two or three be gathered together , above all , introduce a stranger , and he instantly became a quiet , unobtrusive listener , though never a moody or uncongenial one . ”</p>
   <p>He aspired to a college professorship , for which he made diligent preparation in the classics ; but in spite of his native abilities and excellent attainments , he never secured this object of his ambition . Leaving Charleston , he became a tutor in private families ; but on holiday occasions he was accustomed to return to the city , where he was cordially welcomed by his friends . Among these was William Gilmore Simms , a sort of Maecenas to aspiring genius , who gathered about him the younger literary men of his acquaintance . At the little dinners he was accustomed to give , no one manifested a keener enjoyment than Timrod , when , in the words of Hayne :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Around the social board</l>
     <l n="2">The impetuous flood tide poured</l>
     <l n="3">Of curbless mirth , and keen sparkling jest</l>
     <l n="4">Vanished like wine-foam on its golden crest . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">During all these years of toil and waiting the poetic muse was not idle .</l>
     <l n="6">Under the pseudonym “ Aglaus , ” the name of a minor pastoral poet of</l>
     <l n="7">Greece , he became a frequent and favorite contributor to the Southern</l>
     <l n="8">Literary Messenger of Richmond , Virginia . Later he became one of the</l>
     <l n="9">principal contributors , both in prose and poetry , to Russell 's</l>
     <l n="10">Magazine in Charleston . It was in these periodicals that the</l>
     <l n="11">foundation of his fame was laid .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Timrod 's first volume of poetry , made up of pieces taken chiefly from these magazines , appeared in 1860 , from the press of Ticknor &amp; Fields , Boston . It was Hayne 's judgment that “ a better first volume of the kind has seldom appeared anywhere . ” It contains most of the pieces found in subsequent editions of his works . Here and there , both North and South , a discerning critic recognized in the poet “ a lively , delicate fancy , and a graceful beauty of expression . ” But , upon the whole , the book attracted little attention — a fact that came to the poet as a deep disappointment . In the words of Dr. Bruns , who was familiar with the circumstances of the poet , “ success was to him a bitter need , for not his living merely , but his life was staked upon it . ”</p>
   <p>When this volume appeared , Timrod was more than a poetic tyro . Apart from native inspiration , in which he was surpassed by few of his contemporaries , he had reflected profoundly on his art , and nursed his genius on the masterpieces of English song . In addition to Shakespeare he had carefully pondered Milton , Wordsworth , and Tennyson . From Wordsworth especially he learned to appreciate the poetry of common things , and to discern the mystic presence of that spirit ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the round ocean , and the living air ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the blue sky , and in the mind of man . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Timrod , like Poe , formulated a theory of poetry which it is interesting to study , as it throws light on his own work . It reveals to us the ideal at which he aimed . In a famous essay Poe made beauty the sole realm and end of poetry . To Timrod belongs the credit of setting forth a larger and juster conception of the poetic art . To beauty he adds power and truth as legitimate sources of poetry . “ I think , ” he says , “ when we recall the many and varied sources of poetry , we must , perforce , confess that it is wholly impossible to reduce them all to the simple element of beauty . Two other elements , at least , must be added , and these are power , when it is developed in some noble shape , and truth , whether abstract or not , when it affects the common heart of mankind . ”</p>
   <p>Timrod regarded a poem as a work of art . He justly held that a poem should have “ one purpose , and that the materials of which it is composed should be so selected and arranged as to help enforce it . ” He distinguished between the moment of inspiration , “ when the great thought strikes for the first time along the brain and flushes the cheek with the sudden revelation of beauty or grandeur , and the hour of patient , elaborate execution . ” Accordingly he quoted with approval the lines of Matthew Arnold :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ We cannot kindle when we will</l>
     <l n="2">The fire that in the heart resides ;</l>
     <l n="3">The spirit bloweth and is still ;</l>
     <l n="4">In mystery our soul abides ;</l>
     <l n="5">But tasks in hours of insight willed ,</l>
     <l n="6">May be through hours of gloom fulfilled . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Timrod 's poetry is characterized by clearness , simplicity , and force . He was not a mystic ; his thoughts and emotions are not obscured in voluble melody . To him poetry is more than rhythmic harmony . Beneath his delicate imagery and rhythmical sweetness are poured treasures of thought and truth . In diction he belongs to the school of Wordsworth ; his language is not strained or farfetched , but such as is natural to cultured men in a state of emotion . “ Poetry , ” he says in an early volume of Russell 's Magazine , “ does not deal in abstractions . However abstract be his thought , the poet is compelled , by his passion-fused imagination , to give it life , form , or color . Hence the necessity of employing the sensuous or concrete words of the language , and hence the exclusion of long words , which in English are nearly all purely and austerely abstract , from the poetic vocabulary . ”</p>
   <p>He defends the use of the sonnet , in which , like Hayne , he excelled . He admits that the sonnet is artificial in structure ; but , as already pointed out , he distinguishes the moment of inspiration , from the subsequent labor of composition . In the act of writing , the poet passes into the artist . And “ the very restriction so much complained of in the sonnet , ” he says , “ the artist knows to be an advantage . It forces him to condensation . ” His sonnets are characterized by a rare lucidity of thought and expression .</p>
   <p>The principal piece in Timrod 's first volume , to which we now return , and the longest poem he ever wrote , is entitled A Vision of Poesy . In the experience of the imaginative hero , who seems an idealized portrait of the poet himself , we find an almost unequaled presentation of the nature and uses of poetry . The spirit of Poesy , “ the angel of the earth , ” thus explains her lofty mission :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ And ever since that immemorial hour</l>
     <l n="2">When the glad morning stars together sung ,</l>
     <l n="3">My task hath been , beneath a mightier Power ,</l>
     <l n="4">To keep the world forever fresh and young ;</l>
     <l n="5">I give it not its fruitage and its green ,</l>
     <l n="6">But clothe it with a glory all unseen . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">And what are the objects on which this angel of Poesy loves to dwell ?</l>
     <l n="8">Truth , freedom , passion , she answers , and —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ All lovely things , and gentle — the sweet laugh</l>
     <l n="10">Of children , girlhood 's kiss , and friendship 's clasp ,</l>
     <l n="11">The boy that sporteth with the old man 's staff ,</l>
     <l n="12">The baby , and the breast its fingers grasp —</l>
     <l n="13">All that exalts the grounds of happiness ,</l>
     <l n="14">All griefs that hallow , and all joys that bless ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="15">“ To me are sacred ; at my holy shrine</l>
     <l n="16">Love breathes its latest dreams , its earliest hints ;</l>
     <l n="17">I turn life 's tasteless waters into wine ,</l>
     <l n="18">And flush them through and through with purple tints .</l>
     <l n="19">Wherever earth is fair , and heaven looks down ,</l>
     <l n="20">I rear my altars , and I wear my crown . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Many of the poems in this first volume are worthy of note , as revealing some phase of the poet 's versatile gifts — delicate fancy , simplicity and truth , lucid force , or finished art . The Lily Confidante , is a light , lilting fancy , the moral of which is :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Love 's the lover 's only magic ,</l>
     <l n="2">Truth the very subtlest art ;</l>
     <l n="3">Love that feigns , and lips that flatter ,</l>
     <l n="4">Win no modest heart . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Past was first published in the Southern Literary Messenger , and afterwards went the rounds of the press . It teaches the important truth that we are the sum of all we have lived through . The past forms the atmosphere which we breathe today ; it is —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ A shadowy land , where joy and sorrow kiss ,</l>
     <l n="2">Each still to each corrective and relief ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where dim delights are brightened into bliss ,</l>
     <l n="4">And nothing wholly perishes but grief .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Ah me !— not dies — no more than spirit dies ;</l>
     <l n="6">But in a change like death is clothed with wings ;</l>
     <l n="7">A serious angel , with entranced eyes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Looking to far-off and celestial things . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Timrod possessed an ardent spirit that was stirred to its depths by the Civil War . His martial songs , with their fierce intensity , better voiced the feelings of the South at that time than those of Hayne or any other Southern singer . In his Ethnogenesis — the birth of a nation — he celebrates in a lofty strain the rise of the Confederacy , of which he cherished large and generous hopes :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The type</l>
     <l n="2">Whereby we shall be known in every land</l>
     <l n="3">Is that vast gulf which lips our Southern strand ,</l>
     <l n="4">And through the cold , untempered ocean pours</l>
     <l n="5">Its genial streams , that far off Arctic shores</l>
     <l n="6">May sometimes catch upon the softened breeze</l>
     <l n="7">Strange tropic warmth and hints of summer seas . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But his most stirring lyrics are Carolina and A Cry to Arms , which in the exciting days of ‘ 61 deeply moved the Southern heart , but which today serve as melancholy mementos of a long-past sectional bitterness . Of the vigorous lines of the former , Hayne says in an interesting autobiographic touch , “ I read them first , and was thrilled by their power and pathos , upon a stormy March evening in Fort Sumter ! Walking along the battlements , under the red lights of a tempestuous sunset , the wind steadily and loudly blowing from off the bar across the tossing and moaning waste of waters , driven inland ; with scores of gulls and white sea-birds flying and shrieking round me ,— those wild voices of Nature mingled strangely with the rhythmic roll and beat of the poet 's impassioned music . The very spirit , or dark genius , of the troubled scene appeared to take up , and to repeat such verses as :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ ‘ I hear a murmur as of waves</l>
     <l n="2">That grope their way through sunless caves ,</l>
     <l n="3">Like bodies struggling in their graves ,</l>
     <l n="4">Carolina !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ ‘ And now it deepens ; slow and grand</l>
     <l n="6">It swells , as rolling to the land ,</l>
     <l n="7">An ocean broke upon the strand ,</l>
     <l n="8">Carolina ! ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>These impassioned war lyrics brought the poet speedy popularity . For a time his hopes were lifted up to a roseate future . In 1862 some of his influential friends formed the project of bringing out a handsome edition of his poems in London . The war correspondent of the London Illustrated News , himself an artist , volunteered to furnish original illustrations . The scheme , at which the poet was elated , promised at once bread and fame . But , as in so many other instances , he was doomed to bitter disappointment . The increasing stress of the great conflict absorbed the energies of the South ; and the promising plan , notwithstanding the poet 's popularity , was buried beneath the noise and tumult of battle .</p>
   <p>Disqualified by feeble health from serving in the ranks , Timrod , shortly after the battle of Shiloh , went to Tennessee as the war correspondent of the Charleston Mercury . To his retiring and sympathetic nature the scenes of war were painful . “ One can scarcely conceive , ” says Dr. Bruns , “ of a situation more hopelessly wretched than that of a mere child in the world 's ways suddenly flung down into the heart of that strong retreat , and tossed like a straw on the crest of those refluent waves , from which he escaped as by a miracle . ”</p>
   <p>In 1863 he went to Columbia as associate editor of the South Carolinian . He was scarcely less happy and vigorous in prose than in verse . A period of prosperity seemed at last to be dawning ; and , in the cheerful prospect , he ventured to marry Miss Kate Goodwin of Charleston , “ Katie , the fair Saxon , ” whom he had long loved and of whom he had sung in one of his longest and sweetest poems . But his happiness was of brief duration . In a twelvemonth the army of General Sherman entered Columbia , demolished his office , and sent him adrift as a helpless fugitive .</p>
   <p>The close of the war found him a ruined man ; he was almost destitute of property and broken in health . He was obliged to sell some of his household furniture to keep his family in bread . “ We have , ” he says , in a sadly playful letter to Hayne at this period , “ we have — let me see !— yes , we have eaten two silver pitchers , one or two dozen silver forks , several sofas , innumerable chairs , and a huge — bedstead ! ” He could find no paying market for his poems in the impoverished South ; and in the North political feeling was still too strong to give him access to the magazines there . The only employment he could find was some clerical work for a season in the governor 's office , where he sometimes toiled far beyond his strength . In this time of discouragement and need , the gloom of which was never lifted , he pathetically wrote to Hayne : “ I would consign every line of my verse to eternal oblivion for one hundred dollars in hand . ”</p>
   <p>In 1867 his physicians recommended a change of air ; and accordingly he spent a month with his lifelong friend Hayne at Copse Hill . It was the one rift in the clouds before the fall of night . There is a pathetic beauty in the fellowship of the two poets during these brief weeks , when , with spirits often attuned to high thought and feeling , they roamed together among the pines or sat beneath the stars . “ We would rest on the hillsides , ” says Hayne , “ in the swaying golden shadows , watching together the Titanic masses of snow-white clouds which floated slowly and vaguely through the sky , suggesting by their form , whiteness , and serene motion , despite the season , flotillas of icebergs upon Arctic seas . Like lazzaroni we basked in the quiet noons , sunk in the depths of reverie , or perhaps of yet more ‘ charmed sleep . ’ Or we smoked , conversing lazily between the puffs ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Next to some pine whose antique roots just peeped</l>
     <l n="2">From out the crumbling bases of the sand . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Timrod survived but a few weeks after his return to Columbia . The circumstances of his death were most pathetic . Though sustained by Christian hopes , he still longed to live a season with the dear ones about him . When , after a period of intense agony that preceded his dissolution , his sister murmured to him , “ You will soon be at rest now , ” he replied , with touching pathos , “ Yes , my sister , but love is sweeter than rest . ” He died October 7 , 1867 , and was laid to rest in Trinity churchyard , where his grave long remained unmarked .</p>
   <p>Two principal editions of his works have been published : the first in 1873 , with an admirable memoir by Hayne ; the second in 1899 , under the auspices of the Timrod Memorial Association of South Carolina . A number of his poems and his prose writings still remain uncollected ; and there is yet no biography that fully records the story of his life . This fact is not a credit to Southern letters , for , as we have seen , Timrod was a poet of more than commonplace ability and achievement .</p>
   <p>For the most part , his themes were drawn from the ordinary scenes and incidents of life . He was not ambitious of lofty subjects , remote from the hearts and homes of men . He placed sincerity above grandeur ; he preferred love to admiration . He was always pure , brave , and true ; and , as he sang :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The brightest stars are nearest to the earth ,</l>
     <l n="2">And we may track the mighty sun above ,</l>
     <l n="3">Even by the shadow of a slender flower .</l>
     <l n="4">Always , O bard , humility is power !</l>
     <l n="5">And thou mayest draw from matters of the hearth</l>
     <l n="6">Truths wide as nations , and as deep as love . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHAPTER V</p>
   <p>SIDNEY LANIER</p>
   <p>Lanier 's genius was predominantly musical . He descended from a musical ancestry , which included in its line a “ master of the king 's music ” at the court of James I . His musical gifts manifested themselves in early childhood . Without further instruction in music than a knowledge of the notes , which he learned from his mother , he was able to play , almost by intuition , the flute , guitar , violin , piano , and organ . He organized his boyish playmates into an amateur minstrel band ; and when in early manhood he began to confide his most intimate thoughts to a notebook , he wrote , “ The prime inclination — that is , natural bent ( which I have checked , though ) — of my nature is to music , and for that I have the greatest talent ; indeed , not boasting , for God gave it me , I have an extraordinary musical talent , and feel it within me plainly that I could rise as high as any composer . ”</p>
   <p>This early bent and passion for music never left him . His thought continually turned to the subject of music , and in the silences of his soul he frequently heard wonderful melodies . In his novel , Tiger Lilies , he lauds music in a rapturous strain : “ Since in all holy worship , in all conditions of life , in all domestic , social , religious , political , and lonely individual doings ; in all passions , in all countries , earthly or heavenly ; in all stages of civilization , of time , or of eternity ; since , I say , in all these , music is always present to utter the shallowest or the deepest thoughts of man or spirit — let us cease to call music a fine art , to class it with delicate pastry cookery and confectionery , and to fear to make too much of it lest it should make us sick . ” At a later period , while seeking to regain his health by a sojourn in Texas , he wrote to his wife : “ All day my soul hath been cutting swiftly into the great space of the subtle , unspeakable deep , driven by wind after wind of heavenly melody . The very inner spirit and essence of all wind-songs , bird-songs , passion-songs , folk-songs , country-songs , sex-songs , soul-songs , and body-songs , hath blown upon me in quick gusts like the breath of passion , and sailed me into a sea of vast dreams , whereof each wave is at once a vision and a melody . ”</p>

    <p>SIDNEY LANIER .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>This predominance of music in the genius of Lanier is at once the source of his strength and of his weakness in poetry . In his poems , and in his work entitled The Science of English Verse , it is the musical element of poetry upon which the principal emphasis is laid . This fact makes him the successor of Poe in American letters . Both in theory and in practice Lanier has , as we shall see , achieved admirable results . But , after all , the musical element of poetry is of minor importance . It is a means , and not an end . No jingle of sound can replace the delicacy of fancy , nobleness of sentiment and energy of thought that constitute what we may call the soul of poetry . Rhapsody is not the highest form of poetic achievement . In its noblest forms poetry is the medium through which great souls , like Homer , Virgil , Shakespeare , Milton , Tennyson , give to the world , with classic self-restraint , the fruitage of their highest thought and emotion .</p>
   <p>The life of Lanier was a tragedy . While lighted here and there with a fleeting joy , its prevailing tone was one of sadness . The heroic courage with which he met disease and poverty impart to his life an inspiring grandeur . He was born at Macon , Georgia , February 3 , 1842 . His sensitive spirit early responded to the beauties of Nature ; and in his hunting and fishing trips , in which he was usually accompanied by his younger brother Clifford , he caught something of the varied beauties of marsh , wood , and sky , which were afterwards to be so admirably woven into his poems . He early showed a fondness for books , and in the well-stored shelves of his father 's library he found ample opportunity to gratify his taste for reading . His literary tastes were doubtless formed on the old English classics — Shakespeare , Milton , Pope , Addison — which formed a part of every Southern gentleman 's library .</p>
   <p>At the age of fifteen he entered the Sophomore class of Oglethorpe College , near Milledgeville , an institution that did not have sufficient vitality to survive the Civil War . He did not think very highly of the course of instruction , and found his chief delight , as perhaps the best part of his culture , in the congenial circle of friends he gathered around him . The evenings he spent with them were frequently devoted to literature and music . A classmate , Mr. T. F. Newell , gives us a vivid picture of these social features of his college life . “ I can recall , ” he says , “ my association with him with sweetest pleasure , especially those Attic nights , for they are among the dearest and tenderest recollections of my life , when with a few chosen companions we would read from some treasured volume , it may have been Tennyson , or Carlyle , or Christopher North 's Noctes Ambrosianoe , or we would make the hours vocal with music and song ; those happy nights , which were veritable refections of the gods , and which will be remembered with no other regret than that they will nevermore return . On such occasions I have seen him walk up and down the room and with his flute extemporize the sweetest music ever vouchsafed to mortal ear . At such times it would seem as if his soul were in a trance , and could only find existence , expression , in the ecstasy of tone , that would catch our souls with his into the very seventh heaven of harmony . ”</p>
   <p>Lanier was a diligent student , and easily stood among the first of his classes , particularly in mathematics . His reading took a wide range . In addition to the leading authors of the nineteenth century , he showed a fondness for what was old and quaint in our literature . He delighted in Burton 's Anatomy of Melancholy and in the works of “ the poet - preacher , ” Jeremy Taylor . At this time , too , his thoughtful nature turned to the serious problem of his life work . He eagerly questioned his capabilities as preliminary , to use his own words , “ to ascertaining God 's will with reference to himself . ” As already learned from his notebook , he early recognized his extraordinary gifts in music . But his ambition aimed at more than a musician 's career , for it seemed to him , as he said , that there were greater things that he might do .</p>
   <p>His ability and scholarship made a favorable impression on the college authorities , and immediately after his graduation he was elected to a tutorship . From this position , so congenial to his scholarly tastes , he was called , after six months , by the outbreak of the Civil War . In his boyhood he had shown a martial spirit . With his younger brother he joined the Macon Volunteers , and soon saw heavy service in Virginia . He took part in the battles of Seven Pines , Drewry 's Bluffs , and Malvern Hill , in all of which he displayed a chivalrous courage . Afterward he became a signal officer and scout . “ Nearly two years , ” he says , in speaking of this part of his service , “ were passed in skirmishes , racing to escape the enemy 's gunboats , signaling dispatches , serenading country beauties , poring over chance books , and foraging for provender . ” In 1864 he became a blockade runner , and in his first run out from near Fort Fisher , he was captured and taken to Point Lookout prison .</p>
   <p>It is remarkable that , amid the distractions and hardships of active service , his love of music and letters triumphantly asserted itself . His flute was his constant companion . He utilized the brief intervals of repose that came to him in camp to set some of Tennyson 's songs to music and to prosecute new lines of literary study . He took up the study of German , in which he became quite proficient , and by the light of the camp fire at night translated from Heine , Schiller , and Goethe . At the same time his sympathy with the varied aspects of Nature was deepened . Trees and flowers and ferns revealed to him their mystic beauty ; and like Wordsworth , he found it easy , “ in the lily , the sunset , the mountain , and rosy hues of all life , to trace God . ”</p>
   <p>It was during his campaigns in Virginia that he began the composition of his only novel , Tiger Lilies , which was not completed , however , till 1867 . It is now out of print . Though immature and somewhat chaotic , it clearly reveals the imaginative temperament of the author . War is imaged to his mind as “ a strange , enormous , terrible flower , ” which he wishes might be eradicated forever and ever . As might be expected , music finds an honored place in its pages . He regards music as essential to the home . “ Given the raw materials , ” he says , “ to wit , wife , children , a friend or two , and a house ,— two other things are necessary . These are a good fire and good music . And inasmuch as we can do without the fire for half the year , I may say that music is the one essential . After the evening spent around the piano , or the flute , or the violin , how warm and how chastened is the kiss with which the family all say good night ! Ah , the music has taken all the day cares and thrown them into its terrible alembic and boiled them and rocked them and cooled them , till they are crystallized into one care , which is a most sweet and rare desirable sorrow — the yearning for God . ”</p>
   <p>After the war came a rude struggle for existence — a struggle in which tuberculosis , contracted during his camp life , gradually sapped his strength . Hemorrhages became not infrequent , and he was driven from one locality to another in a vain search for health . But he never lost hope ; and his sufferings served to bring out his indomitable , heroic spirit , and to stimulate him to the highest degree of intellectual activity . Few men have accomplished more when so heavily handicapped by disease and poverty . The record of his struggle is truly pathetic . In a letter to Paul Hamilton Hayne , written in 1880 , he gives us a glimpse both of his physical suffering and his mental agony . “ I could never tell you , ” he says , “ the extremity of illness , of poverty , and of unceasing toil , in which I have spent the last three years , and you would need only once to see the weariness with which I crawl to bed after a long day 's work , and after a long night 's work at the heels of it — and Sundays just as well as other days — in order to find in your heart a full warrant for my silence . It seems incredible that I have printed such an unchristian quantity of matter — all , too , tolerably successful — and secured so little money ; and the wife and the four boys , who are so lovely that I would not think a palace good enough for them if I had it , make one 's earnings seem all the less . ” During all these years of toil he longed to be delivered from the hard struggle for bread that he might give himself more fully to music and poetry .</p>
   <p>In 1867 , while in charge of a prosperous school at Prattville , Alabama , he married Miss Mary Day , of Macon , Georgia . It proved a union in which Lanier found perpetual inspiration and comfort . His new-found strength and happiness are reflected in more than one of his poems . In Acknowledgment we read :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ By the more height of thy sweet stature grown ,</l>
     <l n="2">Twice-eyed with thy gray vision set in mine ,</l>
     <l n="3">I ken far lands to wifeless men unknown ,</l>
     <l n="4">I compass stars for one-sexed eyes too fine . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And in My Springs , he says again , with great beauty :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">“ Dear eyes , dear eyes and rare complete —</l>
     <l n="7">Being heavenly-sweet and earthly-sweet —</l>
     <l n="8">I marvel that God made you mine ,</l>
     <l n="9">For when He frowns , ‘ tis then ye shine ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In 1873 , after giving up the study of law in his father 's office , he went to Baltimore , where he was engaged as first flute for the Peabody Symphony concerts . This engagement was a bold undertaking , which cannot be better presented than in his own words . In a letter to Hayne he says : “ Aside from the complete bouleversement of proceeding from the courthouse to the footlights , I was a raw player and a provincial withal , without practice , and guiltless of instruction — for I had never had a teacher . To go under these circumstances among old professional players , and assume a leading part in a large orchestra which was organized expressly to play the most difficult works of the great masters , was ( now that it 's all over ) a piece of temerity that I do n't remember ever to have equaled before . But I trusted in love , pure and simple , and was not disappointed ; for , as if by miracle , difficulties and discouragements melted away before the fire of a passion for music which grows ever stronger within my heart ; and I came out with results more gratifying than it is becoming in me to specify . ” His playing possessed an exquisite charm . “ In his hands the flute , ” to quote from the tribute paid him by his director , “ no longer remained a mere material instrument , but was transformed into a voice that set heavenly harmonies into vibration . Its tones developed colors , warmth , and a low sweetness of unspeakable poetry ; they were not only true and pure , but poetic , allegoric as it were , suggestive of the depths and heights of being and of the delights which the earthly ear never hears and the earthly eye never sees . ”</p>
   <p>Henceforth Baltimore was to be Lanier 's home . In addition to music , he gave himself seriously to literature . Before this period he had written a number of poems , limited in range and somewhat labored in manner . The current of his life still set to music , and his poetic efforts seem to have been less a matter of inspiration than of deliberate choice . In literary form the influence of Poe is discernible ; but in subject-matter the sounds and colors of Nature , as in the poetry of his later years , occupy a prominent place . Of the poems of this early period the songs for The Jacquerie are the best . Here is a stanza of Betrayal :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The sun has kissed the violet sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">And burned the violet to a rose .</l>
     <l n="3">O sea ! wouldst thou not better be</l>
     <l n="4">More violet still ? Who knows ? Who knows ?</l>
     <l n="5">Well hides the violet in the wood :</l>
     <l n="6">The dead leaf wrinkles her a hood ,</l>
     <l n="7">And winter 's ill is violet 's good ;</l>
     <l n="8">But the bold glory of the rose ,</l>
     <l n="9">It quickly comes and quickly goes —</l>
     <l n="10">Red petals whirling in white snows ,</l>
     <l n="11">Ah me ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>After taking up his residence in Baltimore , Lanier entered upon a comprehensive course of reading and study , particularly in early English literature . He studied Anglo-Saxon , and familiarized himself with Langland and Chaucer . He understood that any great poetic achievement must be based on extensive knowledge . A sweet warbler may depend on momentary inspiration ; but the great singer , who is to instruct and move his age , must possess the insight and breadth of vision that come alone from a profound acquaintance with Nature and human history . With keen critical discernment Lanier said that “ the trouble with Poe was , he did not know enough . He needed to know a good many more things in order to be a great poet . ” It was to prepare himself for the highest flights possible to him that he entered , with inextinguishable ardor , upon a wide course of reading .</p>
   <p>In 1874 he was commissioned by a railroad company to write up the scenery , climate , and history of Florida . While spending a month or two with his family in Georgia , he wrote Corn , which deservedly ranks as one of his noblest poems . The delicate forms and colors of Nature touched him to an ecstasy of delight ; and at the same time they bodied forth to his imagination deep spiritual truths . As we read this poem , we feel that the poet has reached a height of which little promise is given in his earlier poems . Here are the opening lines :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ To-day the woods are trembling through and through</l>
     <l n="2">With shimmering forms , and flash before my view ,</l>
     <l n="3">Then melt in green as dawn-stars melt in blue .</l>
     <l n="4">The leaves that wave against my cheek caress</l>
     <l n="5">Like women 's hands ; the embracing boughs express</l>
     <l n="6">A subtlety of mighty tenderness ;</l>
     <l n="7">The copse-depths into little noises start ,</l>
     <l n="8">That sound anon like beatings of a heart ,</l>
     <l n="9">Anon like talk ‘ twixt lips not far apart .</l>
     <l n="10">The beach dreams balm , as a dreamer hums a song ;</l>
     <l n="11">Through that vague wafture , expirations strong</l>
     <l n="12">Throb from young hickories breathing deep and long</l>
     <l n="13">With stress and urgence bold of prisoned spring</l>
     <l n="14">And ecstasy burgeoning . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This poem is remarkable , too , for its presentation of Lanier 's conception of the poetic office . The poet should be a prophet and leader , arousing mankind to all noble truth and action :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Look , out of line one tall corn-captain stands</l>
     <l n="2">Advanced beyond the foremost of his bands ,</l>
     <l n="3">And waves his blades upon the very edge</l>
     <l n="4">And hottest thicket of the battling hedge .</l>
     <l n="5">Thou lustrous stalk , that ne'er mayst walk nor talk ,</l>
     <l n="6">Still shalt thou type the poet-soul sublime</l>
     <l n="7">That leads the vanward of his timid time ,</l>
     <l n="8">And sings up cowards with commanding rhyme —</l>
     <l n="9">Soul calm , like thee , yet fain , like thee , to grow</l>
     <l n="10">By double increment , above , below ;</l>
     <l n="11">Soul homely , as thou art , yet rich in grace like thee ,</l>
     <l n="12">Teaching the yeomen selfless chivalry</l>
     <l n="13">That moves in gentle curves of courtesy ;</l>
     <l n="14">Soul filled like thy long veins with sweetness tense .</l>
     <l n="15">By every godlike sense</l>
     <l n="16">Transmuted from the four wild elements . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For a time Lanier had difficulty in finding a publisher . He made a visit to New York , but met only with rebuffs . But upheld , like Wordsworth , by a strong consciousness of the excellence of his work , he did not lose his cheerful hope and courage . “ The more I am thrown against these people here , and the more reverses I suffer at their hands , the more confident I am of beating them finally . I do not mean by ‘ beating ’ that I am in opposition to them , or that I hate them or feel aggrieved with them ; no , they know no better and they act up to their light with wonderful energy and consistency . I only mean that I am sure of being able , some day , to teach them better things and nobler modes of thought and conduct . ” Corn finally appeared in Lippincott 's Magazine for February , 1875 .</p>
   <p>From this time poetry became a larger part of Lanier 's life . His poetic genius had attained to fullness of power . He gave freer rein to imagination and thought and expression . Speaking of Special Pleading , which was written in 1875 , he says : “ In this little song , I have begun to dare to give myself some freedom in my own peculiar style , and have allowed myself to treat words , similes , and meters with such freedom as I desired . The result convinces me that I can do so now safely . ” In the next two or three years he produced such notable poems as The Song of the Chattahoochee , The Symphony , The Revenge of Hamish , Clover , The Bee , and The Waving of the Corn . They slowly gained recognition , and brought him the fellowship and encouragement of not a few literary people of distinction , among whom Bayard Taylor and Edmund Clarence Stedman deserve especial mention .</p>
   <p>Perhaps none of Lanier 's poems has been more popular than The Song of the Chattahoochee . It does not reach the poetic heights of a few of his other poems , but it is perfectly clear , and has a pleasant lilting movement . Moreover , it teaches the important truth that we are to be dumb to the siren voices of ease and pleasure when the stern voice of duty calls . The concluding stanza is as follows :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ But oh , not the hills of Habersham ,</l>
     <l n="2">And oh , not the valleys of Hall ,</l>
     <l n="3">Shall hinder the rain from attaining the plain ,</l>
     <l n="4">For downward the voices of duty call —</l>
     <l n="5">Downward to toil and be mixed with the main .</l>
     <l n="6">The dry fields burn and the mills are to turn ,</l>
     <l n="7">And a thousand meadows mortally yearn ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the final main from beyond the plain</l>
     <l n="9">Calls o'er the hills of Habersham ,</l>
     <l n="10">And calls through the valleys of Hall . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In 1876 , upon the recommendation of Bayard Taylor , Lanier was invited to write the centennial Cantata . As a poem , not much can be said in its favor . Its thought and form fall far below its ambitious conception , in which Columbia presents a meditation on the completed century of our country 's history . On its publication it was subject to a good deal of unfavorable criticism ; but through it all , though it must have been a bitter disappointment , the poet never lost his faith in his genius and destiny . “ The artist shall put forth , humbly and lovingly , ” he wrote to his father , “ and without bitterness against opposition , the very best and highest that is within him , utterly regardless of contemporary criticism . What possible claim can contemporary criticism set up to respect — that criticism which crucified Jesus Christ , stoned Stephen , hooted Paul for a madman , tried Luther for a criminal , tortured Galileo , bound Columbus in chains , and drove Dante into a hell of exile ? ”</p>
   <p>The need of a regular income became more and more a necessity . “ My head and my heart , ” he wrote , “ are both so full of poems , which the dreadful struggle for bread does not give me time to put on paper , that I am often driven to headache and heartache purely for want of an hour or two to hold a pen . ” He sought various positions — a clerkship in Washington , an assistant 's place in the Peabody Library , a consulship in the south of France — all in vain . He lectured to parlor classes in literature — an enterprise from which he seems to have derived more fame than money . Finally , in 1879 , he was appointed to a lectureship in English literature in Johns Hopkins University , from which dates the final period of his literary activity and of his life .</p>
   <p>The first fruits of this appointment were a series of lectures on metrical forms , which appeared , in 1880 , in a volume entitled The Science of English Verse . It is an original and suggestive work , in which , however , the author 's predilections for music carry him too far . He has done well to emphasize the time element in English versification ; but his attempt to reduce all forms of verse to a musical notation can hardly be regarded as successful . His work , though comprehensive in scope , was not intended to impose a new set of laws upon the poet . “ For the artist in verse , ” he says in his brief concluding chapter , “ there is no law : the perception and love of beauty constitute the whole outfit ; and what is herein set forth is to be taken merely as enlarging that perception and exalting that love . In all cases , the appeal is to the ear ; but the ear should , for that purpose , be educated up to the highest possible plane of culture . ”</p>
   <p>A second series of lectures , composed and delivered when the anguish of mortal illness was upon him , was subsequently published under the title , The English Novel . Its aim was to trace the development of personality in literature . It contains much suggestive and sound criticism . He did not share the fear entertained by some of his contemporaries , that science would gradually abolish poetry . Many of the finest poems in our language , as he pointed out , have been written while the wonderful discoveries of recent science were being made . “ Now , ” he continues , “ if we examine the course and progress of this poetry , born thus within the very grasp and maw of this terrible science , it seems to me that we find — as to the substance of poetry — a steadily increasing confidence and joy in the mission of the poet , in the sacredness of faith and love and duty and friendship and marriage , and the sovereign fact of man 's personality , while as to the form of the poetry , we find that just as science has pruned our faith ( to make it more faithful ) , so it has pruned our poetic form and technic , cutting away much unproductive wood and effloresence , and creating finer reserves and richer yields . ” Among novelists he assigns the highest place to George Eliot , who “ shows man what he maybe in terms of what he is . ”</p>
   <p>There are two poems of this closing period that exhibit Lanier 's characteristic manner at its best . They are the high-water mark of his poetic achievement . They exemplify his musical theories of meter . They show the trend forced upon him by his innate love of music ; and though he might have written much more , if his life had been prolonged , it is doubtful whether he would have produced anything finer . Any further effort at musical effects would probably have resulted in a kind of ecstatic rhapsody . The first of the poems in question is the Marshes of Glynn , descriptive of the sea marshes near the city of Brunswick , Georgia .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Ye marshes , how candid and simple and nothing-withholding and free —</l>
     <l n="2">Ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea !</l>
     <l n="3">Tolerant plains , that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ye spread and span like the catholic man who hath mightily won</l>
     <l n="5">God out of knowledge , and good out of infinite pain ,</l>
     <l n="6">And sight out of blindness , and purity out of a stain . ”</l>

   <p>The other poem of his closing period , Sunrise , his greatest production , was written during the high fever of his last illness . In the poet 's collected works , it is placed first in the series called Hymns of the Marshes . At times it almost reaches the point of ecstasy . His love of Nature finds supreme utterance .</p>

   <p>Throughout his artistic life Lanier was true to the loftiest ideals . He did not separate artistic from moral beauty . To his sensitive spirit , the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty seemed interchangeable terms . He did not make the shallow cry of “ art for art 's sake ” a pretext or excuse for moral taint . On the contrary , he maintained that all art should be the embodiment of truth , goodness , love . “ Can not one say with authority , ” he inquires in one of his university lectures , “ to the young artist , whether working in stone , in color , in tones , or in character - forms of the novel : so far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere with your beautiful creation , go forward in the clear conviction that , unless you are suffused — soul and body , one might say — with that moral purpose which finds its largest expression in love — that is , the love of all things in their proper relation — unless you are suffused with this love , do not dare to meddle with beauty ; unless you are suffused with beauty , do not dare to meddle with truth ; unless you are suffused with truth , do not dare to meddle with goodness . In a word , unless you are suffused with truth , wisdom , goodness , and love , abandon the hope that the ages will accept you as an artist . ”</p>
   <p>Through these years of high aspiration and manly endeavor , the poet and musician was waging a losing fight with consumption . He was finally driven to tent life in a high , pure atmosphere as his only hope . He first went to Asheville , North Carolina , and a little later to Lynn . But his efforts to regain his health proved in vain ; and on the 7th of September , 1881 , the tragic struggle was brought to a close .</p>
   <p>The time has hardly come to give a final judgment as to Lanier 's place in American letters . He certainly deserves a place by the side of the very best poets of the South , and perhaps , as many believe , by the side of the greatest masters of American song . His genius had elements of originality equaled only by Poe . He had the high moral purpose of the artist - prophets ; but his efforts after musical effects , as well as his untimely death , prevented the full fruitage of his admirable genius . Many of the poems that he has left us are lacking in spontaneity and artistic finish . Alliterative effects are sometimes obtrusive . His poetic theories , as presented in The Science of English Verse , often outstripped his execution . But , after all these abatements are made , it remains true that in a few pieces he has reached a trembling height of poetic and musical rapture that is unsurpassed in the whole range of American poetry .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
    <head>ABRAM J. RYAN</head>
    <head>The poems of Abram J. Ryan , better known as Father Ryan , are unambitious . The poet modestly wished to call them only verses ; and , as he tells us , they “ were written at random ,— off and on , here , there , anywhere ,— just as the mood came , with little of study and less of art , and always in a hurry . ” His poems do not exhibit a painstaking , polished art . They are largely emotional outpourings of a heart that readily found expression in fluent , melodious lays . The poet-priest understood their character too well to assign them a very high place in the realm of song ; yet the wish he expressed , that they might echo from heart to heart , has been fulfilled in no small degree . In Sentinel Songs he says :—</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I sing with a voice too low</l>
     <l n="2">To be heard beyond to-day ,</l>
     <l n="3">In minor keys of my people 's woe ,</l>
     <l n="4">But my songs pass away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ To-morrow hears them not —</l>
     <l n="6">To-morrow belongs to fame —</l>
     <l n="7">My songs , like the birds ’ , will be forgot ,</l>
     <l n="8">And forgotten shall be my name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ And yet who knows ? Betimes</l>
     <l n="10">The grandest songs depart ,</l>
     <l n="11">While the gentle , humble , and low-toned rhymes</l>
     <l n="12">Will echo from heart to heart . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But few facts are recorded of Father Ryan 's life . The memoir and the critique prefixed to the latest edition of his poems but poorly fulfill their design . Besides the absence of detail , there is an evident lack of taste and breadth of view . The poet 's ecclesiastical relation is unduly magnified ; and the invidious comparisons made and the immoderate laudation expressed are far from agreeable . But we are not left wholly at a loss . With the few recorded facts of his life as guide , the poems of Father Ryan become an interesting and instructive autobiography . He was a spontaneous singer whose inspiration came , not from distant fields of legend , history , science , but from his own experience ; and it is not difficult to read there a romance , or rather a tragedy , which imparts a deep pathos to his life . His interior life , as reflected in his poems , is all of good report , in no point clashing with the moral excellence befitting the priestly office .</p>
   <p>Abram J. Ryan was born in Norfolk , Virginia , August 15 , 1839 , whither his parents , natives of Ireland , had immigrated not long before . He possessed the quick sensibilities characteristic of the Celtic race ; and his love for Ireland is reflected in a stout martial lyric entitled Erin 's Flag :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Lift it up ! lift it up ! the old Banner of Green !</l>
     <l n="2">The blood of its sons has but brightened its sheen ;</l>
     <l n="3">What though the tyrant has trampled it down ,</l>
     <l n="4">Are its folds not emblazoned with deeds of renown ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When he was seven or eight years old , his parents removed to St. Louis . He is said to have shown great aptitude in acquiring knowledge ; and his superior intellectual gifts , associated with an unusual reverence for sacred things , early indicated the priesthood as his future vocation . In the autobiographic poem , Their Story Runneth Thus , we have a picture of his youthful character . With a warm heart , he had more than the changefulness of the Celtic temperament . In his boyhood , as throughout his maturity , he was strangely restless . As he says himself :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The boy was full of moods .</l>
     <l n="2">Upon his soul and face the dark and bright</l>
     <l n="3">Were strangely intermingled . Hours would pass</l>
     <l n="4">Rippling with his bright prattle — and then , hours</l>
     <l n="5">Would come and go , and never hear a word</l>
     <l n="6">Fall from his lips , and never see a smile</l>
     <l n="7">Upon his face . He was so like a cloud</l>
     <l n="8">With ever-changeful hues . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When his preliminary training was ended , he entered the Roman Catholic seminary at Niagara , New York . He was moved to the priesthood by a spirit of deep consecration . The writer of his memoir dwells on the regret with which he severed the ties binding him to home . No doubt he loved and honored his parents . But there was a still stronger attachment , which , broken by his call to the priesthood , filled all his subsequent life with a consecrated sorrow . It was his love for Ethel :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ A fair , sweet girl , with great , brown , wond'ring eyes</l>
     <l n="2">That seemed to listen just as if they held</l>
     <l n="3">The gift of hearing with the power of sight . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The two lovers , forgetting the sacredness of true human affection , had , with equal self-abnegation , resolved to give themselves to the church , she as a nun and he as a priest . He has given a touching picture of their last meeting :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ One night in mid of May their faces met</l>
     <l n="2">As pure as all the stars that gazed on them .</l>
     <l n="3">They met to part from themselves and the world .</l>
     <l n="4">Their hearts just touched to separate and bleed ;</l>
     <l n="5">Their eyes were linked in look , while saddest tears</l>
     <l n="6">Fell down , like rain , upon the cheeks of each :</l>
     <l n="7">They were to meet no more . Their hands were clasped</l>
     <l n="8">To tear the clasp in twain ; and all the stars</l>
     <l n="9">Looked proudly down on them , while shadows knelt ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or seemed to kneel , around them with the awe</l>
     <l n="11">Evoked from any heart by sacrifice .</l>
     <l n="12">And in the heart of that last parting hour</l>
     <l n="13">Eternity was beating . And he said :</l>
     <l n="14">‘ We part to go to Calvary and to God —</l>
     <l n="15">This is our garden of Gethsemane ;</l>
     <l n="16">And here we bow our heads and breathe His prayer</l>
     <l n="17">Whose heart was bleeding , while the angels heard :</l>
     <l n="18">Not my will , Father ! but Thine be done ! ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Roman Catholic training and faith of Father Ryan exerted a deep influence upon his poetry . His ardent studies in the ancient languages and in scholastic theology naturally withdrew his mind , to a greater or less degree , from intimate communion with Nature . His poetry is principally subjective . Nature enters it only in a subordinate way ; its forms and sounds and colors do not inspire in him the rapture found in Hayne and Lanier . He not only treats of Scripture themes , as in St. Stephen , The Masters Voice , and A Christmas Chant , but he also finds subjects , not always happily , in distinctive Roman Catholic dogma . The Feast of the Assumption and The Last of May , both in honor of the Virgin Mary , are sufficiently poetic ; but The Feast of the Sacred Heart is , in parts , too prosaically literal in its treatment of transubstantiation for any but the most believing and devout of Roman Catholics .</p>
   <p>On the breaking out of the Civil War , Father Ryan entered the Confederate army as a chaplain , though he sometimes served in the ranks . In 1863 he ministered to the inmates of a prison in New Orleans during an epidemic of smallpox . His martial songs , The Sword of Robert Lee , The Conquered Banner , and March of the Deathless Dead , have been dear to many Southern hearts . He reverenced Lee as a peerless leader .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Forth from its scabbard ! How we prayed</l>
     <l n="2">That sword might victor be ;</l>
     <l n="3">And when our triumph was delayed ,</l>
     <l n="4">And many a heart grew sore afraid ,</l>
     <l n="5">We still hoped on while gleamed the blade</l>
     <l n="6">Of noble Robert Lee .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">“ Forth from its scabbard all in vain</l>
     <l n="8">Bright flashed the sword of Lee ;</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Tis shrouded now in its sheath again ,</l>
     <l n="10">It sleeps the sleep of our noble slain ,</l>
     <l n="11">Defeated , yet without a stain ,</l>
     <l n="12">Proudly and peacefully . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>After four years of brave , bitter sacrifice beneath the Confederate flag , words like the following appealed strongly to the men and women who loved The Conquered Banner :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Take that Banner down ! ‘ tis tattered ;</l>
     <l n="2">Broken is its staff and shattered ;</l>
     <l n="3">And the valiant hosts are scattered</l>
     <l n="4">Over whom it floated high .</l>
     <l n="5">Oh ! ‘ tis hard for us to fold it ;</l>
     <l n="6">Hard to think there 's none to hold it ;</l>
     <l n="7">Hard that those who once unrolled it</l>
     <l n="8">Now must furl it with a sigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">“ Furl that Banner ! True , ‘ tis gory ,</l>
     <l n="10">Yet ‘ tis wreathed around with glory .</l>
     <l n="11">And ‘ twill live in song and story ,</l>
     <l n="12">Though its folds are in the dust :</l>
     <l n="13">For its fame on brightest pages ,</l>
     <l n="14">Penned by poets and by sages ,</l>
     <l n="15">Shall go sounding down the ages —</l>
     <l n="16">Furl its folds though now we must . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Father Ryan 's devotion to the South was intense . He long refused to accept the results of the war . The wrongs of the so-called Reconstruction period aroused his ardent indignation , and found expression in his song . In The Land We Love he says , with evident reference to those days :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Land where the victor 's flag waves ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where only the dead are the free !</l>
     <l n="3">Each link of the chain that enslaves ,</l>
     <l n="4">But binds us to them and to thee . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But during the epidemic of yellow fever in 1878 , his heart was touched by the splendid generosity of the North ; and , surrendering his sectional prejudice and animosity , he wrote Reunited :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Purer than thy own white snow ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nobler than thy mountains ’ height ;</l>
     <l n="3">Deeper than the ocean 's flow ,</l>
     <l n="4">Stronger than thy own proud might ;</l>
     <l n="5">O Northland ! to thy sister land ,</l>
     <l n="6">Was late thy mercy 's generous deed and grand . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>After the close of the Civil War , the restless temperament of the poet - priest asserted itself in numerous changes of residence . He was successively in Biloxi , Mississippi , Knoxville , Tennessee , and Augusta , Georgia . In the latter place he published for some three years the Banner of the South , a periodical that exerted no small influence on the thought of the state . In 1870 he became pastor of St. Mary 's church in Mobile . Two years later he made a trip to Europe , of which we find interesting reminiscences in his poems . His visit to Rome was the realization of a long-cherished desire . He was honored with an audience by Pope Pius IX , of whom he has given a graphic sketch :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I saw his face to-day ; he looks a chief</l>
     <l n="2">Who fears nor human rage , nor human guile ;</l>
     <l n="3">Upon his cheeks the twilight of a grief ,</l>
     <l n="4">But in that grief the starlight of a smile .</l>
     <l n="5">Deep , gentle eyes , with drooping lids that tell</l>
     <l n="6">They are the homes where tears of sorrow dwell ;</l>
     <l n="7">A low voice — strangely sweet — whose very tone</l>
     <l n="8">Tells how these lips speak oft with God alone . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">In Milan he was seriously ill . In his poem , After Sickness , we</l>
     <l n="10">find an expression of his world-weariness and his longing for death :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">“ I nearly died , I almost touched the door</l>
     <l n="12">That swings between forever and no more ;</l>
     <l n="13">I think I heard the awful hinges grate ,</l>
     <l n="14">Hour after hour , while I did weary wait</l>
     <l n="15">Death 's coming ; but alas ! ‘ twas all in vain :</l>
     <l n="16">The door half opened and then closed again . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>As a priest Father Ryan was faithful to his duties . But whether ministering at the altar or making the rounds of his parish , his spirit frequently found utterance in song . In 1880 he published a volume of poems , to which only a few additions were subsequently made . The keynote of his poetry is struck in the opening piece , Song of the Mystic . He dwelt much in the “ Valley of Silence . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Do you ask me the place of the Valley ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ye hearts that are harrowed by care ?</l>
     <l n="3">It lieth afar between mountains ,</l>
     <l n="4">And God and His angels are there :</l>
     <l n="5">And one is the dark mount of Sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="6">And one the bright mountain of Prayer . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The prevailing tone of Father Ryan 's poems is one of sadness . His harp rarely vibrated to cheerful strains . What was the cause of this sadness ? It may have been his keen sense of the tragic side of human life ; it may have been the enduring anguish that came from the crucified love of his youth . The poet himself refused to tell . In Lines — 1875 , he says :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Go list to the voices of air , earth , and sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the voices that sound in the sky ;</l>
     <l n="3">Their songs may be joyful to some , but to me</l>
     <l n="4">There 's a sigh in each chord and a sigh in each key ,</l>
     <l n="5">And thousands of sighs swell their grand melody .</l>
     <l n="6">Ask them what ails them : they will not reply .</l>
     <l n="7">They sigh — sigh forever — but never tell why .</l>
     <l n="8">Why does your poetry sound like a sigh ?</l>
     <l n="9">Their lips will not answer you ; neither shall I . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Yet , in spite of the prevailing tone of sorrow and weariness , Father Ryan</l>
     <l n="11">was no pessimist . He held that life has “ more of sweet than gall ” —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">“ For every one : no matter who —</l>
     <l n="13">Or what their lot — or high or low ;</l>
     <l n="14">All hearts have clouds — but heaven 's blue</l>
     <l n="15">Wraps robes of bright around each woe ;</l>
     <l n="16">And this is truest of the true :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">“ That joy is stronger here than grief ,</l>
     <l n="18">Fills more of life , far more of years ,</l>
     <l n="19">And makes the reign of sorrow brief ;</l>
     <l n="20">Gives more of smiles for less of tears .</l>
     <l n="21">Joy is life 's tree — grief but its leaves . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Father Ryan conceived of the poet 's office as something seerlike or prophetic . With him , as with all great poets , the message counted for more than do rhythm and rhyme . Divorced from truth , art seemed to him but a skeleton masque . He preferred those melodies that rise on the wings of thought , and come to human hearts with an inspiration of faith and hope . He regarded genuine poets as the high priests of Nature . Their sensitive spirits , holding themselves aloof from common things , habitually dwell upon the deeper mysteries of life in something of a morbid loneliness . In Poets he says :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ They are all dreamers ; in the day and night</l>
     <l n="2">Ever across their souls</l>
     <l n="3">The wondrous mystery of the dark or bright</l>
     <l n="4">In mystic rhythm rolls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ They live within themselves — they may not tell</l>
     <l n="6">What lieth deepest there ;</l>
     <l n="7">Within their breast a heaven or a hell ,</l>
     <l n="8">Joy or tormenting care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ They are the loneliest men that walk men 's ways ,</l>
     <l n="10">No matter what they seem ;</l>
     <l n="11">The stars and sunlight of their nights and days</l>
     <l n="12">Move over them in dream . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>With Wordsworth , or rather with the great Apostle to the Gentiles , he held that Nature is but the vesture of God , beneath which may be discerned the divine glory and love . The visible seemed to him but an expression of the invisible .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ For God is everywhere — and he doth find</l>
     <l n="2">In every atom which His hand hath made</l>
     <l n="3">A shrine to hide His presence , and reveal</l>
     <l n="4">His name , love , power , to those who kneel</l>
     <l n="5">In holy faith upon this bright below ,</l>
     <l n="6">And lift their eyes , thro ’ all this mystery ,</l>
     <l n="7">To catch the vision of the great beyond . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With this view of Nature , it was but natural that its sounds and forms — its birds and flowers — should inspire devotion . In St. Mary 's , speaking of the songs and silences of Nature , he says :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ God comes close to me here —</l>
     <l n="2">Back of ev'ry roseleaf there</l>
     <l n="3">He is hiding — and the air</l>
     <l n="4">Thrills with calls to holy prayer ;</l>
     <l n="5">Earth grows far , and heaven near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">“ Every single flower is fraught</l>
     <l n="7">With the very sweetest dreams ,</l>
     <l n="8">Under clouds or under gleams</l>
     <l n="9">Changeful ever — yet meseems</l>
     <l n="10">On each leaf I read God 's thought . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It can hardly be said that Father Ryan ever reaches far poetic heights . Neither in thought nor expression does he often rise above cultured commonplace . Fine artistic quality is supplanted by a sort of melodious fluency . Yet the form and tone of his poetry , nearly always in one pensive key , make a distinct impression , unlike that of any other American singer . “ Religious feeling , ” it has been well said , “ is dominant . The reader seems to be moving about in cathedral glooms , by dimly lighted altars , with sad procession of ghostly penitents and mourners fading into the darkness to the sad music of lamenting choirs . But the light which falls upon the gloom is the light of heaven , and amid tears and sighs , over farewells and crushed happiness , hope sings a vigorous though subdued strain . ” Having once caught his distinctive note of weary melancholy , we can recognize it among a chorus of a thousand singers . It is to his honor that he has achieved a distinctive place in American poetry .</p>
   <p>His poetic craftsmanship is far from perfect . His artistic sense did not aspire to exquisite achievements . He delighted unduly in alliteration , assonance , and rhyming effects , all which he sometimes carried to excess . In the first stanza , for example , of The Conquered Banner , popular as it is , the rhyme effect seems somewhat overdone :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="10">Here and there , too , are unmistakable echoes of Poe , as in the following</l>
     <l n="11">stanza from At Last :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">“ Into a temple vast and dim ,</l>
     <l n="13">Solemn and vast and dim ,</l>
     <l n="14">Just when the last sweet Vesper Hymn</l>
     <l n="15">Was floating far away ,</l>
     <l n="16">With eyes that tabernacled tears —</l>
     <l n="17">Her heart the home of tears —</l>
     <l n="18">And cheeks wan with the woes of years ,</l>
     <l n="19">A woman went one day . ”</l>
    </lg>

   <p>But in spite of these obvious defects , Father Ryan has been for years the most popular of Southern poets . His poems have passed through many editions , and there is still a large demand for them . They have something that outweighs their faults , and appeals strongly to the popular mind and heart . What is it ? Perhaps it is impossible to answer this question fully . But in addition to the merits already pointed out , the work of Father Ryan is for the most part simple , spontaneous , and clear . It generally consists of brief lyrics devoted to the expression of a single mood or reflection . There is nothing in thought or style beyond the ready comprehension of the average reader . It does not require , as does the poetry of Browning , repeated and careful reading to render its meaning clear . It does not offend sensible people with its empty , overdone refinement . From beginning to end Father Ryan 's poetry is a transparent casket , into which he has poured the richest treasures of a deeply sorrowing but noble Christian spirit .</p>
   <p>Again , the pensive , moral tone of his poetry renders it attractive to many persons . He gives expression to the sad , reflective moods that are apt , especially in time of suffering or disappointment , to come to most of us . The moral sense of the American people is strong ; and sometimes a comforting though commonplace truth from Nature is more pleasing than the most exquisite but superficial description of her beauties . How many have found solace in poems like A Thought :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The waving rose , with every breath</l>
     <l n="2">Scents carelessly the summer air ;</l>
     <l n="3">The wounded rose bleeds forth in death</l>
     <l n="4">A sweetness far more rich and rare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ It is a truth beyond our ken —</l>
     <l n="6">And yet a truth that all may read —</l>
     <l n="7">It is with roses as with men ,</l>
     <l n="8">The sweetest hearts are those that bleed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ The flower which Bethlehem saw bloom</l>
     <l n="10">Out of a heart all full of grace ,</l>
     <l n="11">Gave never forth its full perfume</l>
     <l n="12">Until the cross became its vase . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Then again , the poet-priest , as was becoming his character , deals with the mysteries of life . Much of our recent poetry is as trifling in theme as it is polished in workmanship . But Father Ryan habitually brings before us the profounder and sadder aspects of life . The truths of religion , the vicissitudes of human destiny , the tragedy of death — these are the themes in which he finds his inspiration , and to which we all turn in our most serious moments . And though the strain in which he sings is attuned to tears , it is still illumined by a strength-giving faith and hope . When we feel weighed down with a sense of pitiless law , when fate seems to cross our holiest aspirations with a ruthless hand , he bids us be of good cheer .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ There is no fate — God 's love</l>
     <l n="2">Is law beneath each law ,</l>
     <l n="3">And law all laws above</l>
     <l n="4">Fore'er , without a flaw . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In 1883 Father Ryan , whose reputation had been established by his volume of poems , undertook a lecturing tour through the North in the interest of some charitable enterprise . At his best he was an eloquent speaker . But during the later years of his life impaired health interfered with prolonged mental effort . His mission had only a moderate degree of success . His sense of weariness deepened , and his eyes turned longingly to the life to come . In one of his later productions he said :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ My feet are wearied , and my hands are tired ,</l>
     <l n="2">My soul oppressed —</l>
     <l n="3">And I desire , what I have long desired —</l>
     <l n="4">Rest — only rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ And so I cry a weak and human cry ,</l>
     <l n="6">So heart oppressed ;</l>
     <l n="7">And so I sigh a weak and human sigh</l>
     <l n="8">For rest — for rest . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>At length , April 22 , 1886 , in a Franciscan monastery at Louisville , came the rest for which he had prayed . And in that higher life to which he passed , we may believe that he was welcomed by her to whom in youth he had given the tender name of Ullainee , and for whom , through all the years of a great sacrifice , his faithful heart had yearned with an inextinguishable human longing .</p>

   <note xml:id="note1_4" place="bottom" n="1">See note above . There is a peculiar fitness in the reference to the sea in this poem ; for the constellation of the Pleiades was named by the Greeks from their word plein , to sail , because the Mediterranean was navigable with safety during the months these stars were visible .</note>
   <note xml:id="note2_3" place="bottom" n="2">The poet seems to associate the Chaldean shepherd with the Magi , who , as astrologers , observed the stars with profound interest . The hope expressed for the return of the star cannot be regarded , in the light of modern astronomy , as entirely fanciful . Only recently a new star has flamed forth in the constellation Perseus .</note>
   <note xml:id="note3_3" place="bottom" n="3">The fixed stars , continually giving forth immeasurable quantities of heat , are in a process of cooling . Sooner or later they will become dark bodies . Astronomers tell us that there is reason to believe that the dark bodies or burned-out suns of the universe are more numerous than the bright ones , though the number of the latter exceeds 125 millions . The existence of such dark bodies has been established beyond a reasonable doubt .</note>
   <note xml:id="note4_3" place="bottom" n="4">A reference to the old belief that the stars make music in their courses . In Job ( xxxviii . 7 ) we read : “ When the morning stars sang together . ” According to the Platonic philosophy , this music of the spheres , too faint for mortal ears , was heard only by the gods . Shakespeare has given beautiful expression to this belief :—</note>

     <l n="1">“ There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st</l>
     <l n="2">But in his motion like an angel sings ,</l>
     <l n="3">Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins ;</l>
     <l n="4">Such harmony is in immortal souls ;</l>
     <l n="5">But whilst this muddy vesture of decay</l>
     <l n="6">Doth grossly close it in , we cannot hear it . ”</l>

   <note xml:id="note1_6" place="bottom" n="1">See sketch of Cooke , page 19 . In the preface to the volume from which this poem is taken , the author tells us that Florence Vane and Rosalie Lee , another brief lyric , had “ met with more favor than I could ever perceive their just claim to . ” Hence he was kept from “ venturing upon the correction of some faults . ” Rosalie Lee is more than usually defective in meter and rhyme , but Florence Vane cannot easily be improved .</note>
   <note xml:id="note2_5" place="bottom" n="2">“ My meaning , I suppose , ” the poet wrote an inquiring friend , “ was that Florence did not want the capacity to love , but directed her love to no object . Her passions went flowing like a lost river . Byron has a kindred idea expressed by the same figure . Perhaps his verses were in my mind when I wrote my own :—</note>

The latter was confident of victory , and sent a flag of truce to demand surrender . “ You are surrounded by 20 , 000 men , ” wrote the Mexican general , “ and cannot , in any human probability , avoid suffering a rout , and being cut to pieces with your troops . ” Gen. Taylor replied , “ I beg leave to say that I decline acceding to your request . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note3_5" place="bottom" n="3">The battle raged for ten hours with varying success . There was great determination on both sides , as is shown by the heavy losses . The Americans lost 267 killed and 456 wounded ; Santa Anna stated his loss at 1500 , which was probably an underestimate . He left 500 dead on the field . The battle was a decisive one , and left northeastern Mexico in the hands of the Americans .</note>
   <note xml:id="note4_5" place="bottom" n="4">The reference is to Zachary Taylor , who was in command of the American forces . Though born in Virginia , he was brought up in Kentucky , and won his first laurels in command of Kentuckians in the War of 1812 , during which he was engaged in fighting the Indian allies of Great Britain . His victory at Buena Vista aroused great enthusiasm in the United States , and more than any other event led to his election as President .</note>

   <note xml:id="note1_11" place="bottom" n="1">This was Mrs. Helen Stannard , the mother of one of Poe 's schoolmates in Richmond . Her kind and gracious manner made a deep impression on his boyish heart , and soothed his passionate , turbulent nature . In after years this poem was inspired , as the poet tells us , by the memory of “ the one idolatrous and purely ideal love ” of his restless youth .</note>
   <note xml:id="note2_10" place="bottom" n="2">The reference seems to be to the ancient Ligurian town of Nicaea , now Nice , in France . The “ perfumed sea ” would then be the Ligurian sea . But one half suspects that it was the scholarly and musical sound of the word , rather than any aptness of classical reference , that led to the use of the word “ Nicaean . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note3_8" place="bottom" n="3">This appears to be Poe 's indefinite and poetic way of saying that the lady 's beauty and grace brought him an uplifting sense of happiness . After seeing her the first time , “ He returned home in a dream , with but one thought , one hope in life — to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the desolate world so beautiful to him , and filled his lonely heart with the oppression of a new joy . ” — Ingram 's Edgar Allan Poe , Vol . I , p. 32 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note4_7" place="bottom" n="4">Psyche was represented as so exquisitely beautiful that mortals did not dare to love , but only to worship her . The poet could pay no higher tribute to “ Helen . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note5_5" place="bottom" n="5">This little poem — very beautiful in itself — illustrates Poe 's characteristics as a poet : it is indefinite , musical , and intense .</note>
   <note xml:id="note6_5" place="bottom" n="6">This poem is a tribute to his wife , to whom his beautiful devotion has already been spoken of . “ I believe , ” says Mrs. Osgood , “ she was the only woman whom he ever truly loved ; and this is evidenced by the exquisite pathos of the little poem lately written , called ‘ Annabel Lee , ’ of which she was the subject , and which is by far the most natural , simple , tender , and touchingly beautiful of all his songs . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note7_3" place="bottom" n="7">This is Poe 's poetic designation of America .</note>
   <note xml:id="note8_2" place="bottom" n="8">“ Virginia Clemm , born on the 13th of August , 1822 , was still a child when her handsome cousin Edgar revisited Baltimore after his escapade at West Point . A more than cousinly affection , which gradually grew in intensity , resulted from their frequent communion , and ultimately , whilst one , at least , of the two cousins was but a child , they were married . ” — Ingram 's Edgar Allan Poe , Vol . I , p. 136 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note9_2" place="bottom" n="9">These were the angels , to whom “ Annabel Lee ” was akin in sweet , gentle character . “ A lady angelically beautiful in person , and not less beautiful in spirit . ” — Captain Mayne Reid .</note>
   <note xml:id="note10_2" place="bottom" n="10">This may be literally true . At all events , it is related that he visited the tomb of “ Helen ” ; and “ when the autumnal rains fell , and the winds wailed mournfully over the graves , he lingered longest , and came away most regretfully . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note11" place="bottom" n="11">This admirable poem is an allegory . The “ stately palace ” is a man who after a time loses his reason . With this fact in mind , the poem becomes quite clear . The “ banners yellow , glorious , golden ” is the hair ; the “ luminous windows ” are the eyes ; the “ ruler of the realm ” is reason ; “ the fair palace door ” is the mouth ; and the “ evil things ” are the madman 's fantasies . The poem is found in The Fall of the House of Usher .</note>
   <p>Poe claimed that Longfellow 's Beleaguered City was an imitation of The Haunted Palace . The former should be read in connection with the latter . Though some resemblance may be discerned , Longfellow must be acquitted of Poe 's charge of plagiarism . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note12" place="bottom" n="12">This terrible lyric is also an allegory . The “ theater ” is the world , and the “ play ” human life . The “ mimes ” are men , created in the image of God , and are represented as the “ mere puppets ” of circumstance . The “ Phantom chased for evermore ” is happiness ; but for all , the end is death and the grave .</note>
   <note xml:id="note13" place="bottom" n="13">This poem was first published in the New York Evening Mirror , January 29 , 1845 . “ In our opinion , ” wrote the editor , N. P. Willis , “ it is the most effective single example of ‘ fugitive poetry ’ ever published in this country ; and unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception , masterly ingenuity of versification , and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift . ”</note>
   <p>The story of The Raven is given in prose by Poe in his Philosophy of Composition , which contains the best analysis of its structure : “ A raven , having learned by rote the single word , ‘ Nevermore , ’ and having escaped from the custody of its owner , is driven at midnight , through the violence of a storm , to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleams ,— the chamber window of a student , occupied half in poring over a volume , half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased . The casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the bird 's wings , the bird itself perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student , who , amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor 's demeanor , demands of it , in jest and without looking for a reply , its name . The raven addressed answers with its customary word , ‘ Nevermore ’ — a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart of the student , who , giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion , is again startled by the fowl 's repetition of ‘ Nevermore . ’ The student now guesses the state of the case , but is impelled , by the human thirst for self-torture , and in part by superstition , to propound such queries to the bird as will bring him , the lover , the most of the luxury of sorrow , through the anticipated answer , ‘ Nevermore . ’ ” ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note14" place="bottom" n="14">As Poe explains , the raven is “ emblematical of mournful and never-ending remembrance . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note15" place="bottom" n="15">From the position of the bird it has been held that the shadow could not possibly fall upon the floor . But the author says : “ My conception was that of the bracket candelabrum affixed against the wall , high up above the door and bust , as is often seen in the English palaces , and even in some of the better houses in New York . ”</note>

   <note xml:id="note1_12" place="bottom" n="1">This poem , which appeared in the volume of 1855 under the title Aspirations , gives expression to a strong literary impulse . It was genuine in sentiment , and its aspiring spirit and forceful utterance gave promise of no ordinary achievement .</note>

     <l n="2">Of woven paces and of waving hands . ”</l>

   <note xml:id="note3_9" place="bottom" n="3">Tantalus was a character of Greek mythology , who , for divulging the secret counsels of Zeus , was afflicted in the lower world with an insatiable thirst . He stood up to the chin in a lake , the waters of which receded whenever he tried to drink of them .</note>
   <note xml:id="note4_8" place="bottom" n="4">The poet evidently had in mind the lame man who was “ laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful . ” — Acts iii . 2 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note5_6" place="bottom" n="5">A reference to the veil that hung before the Most Holy Place , or “ inmost shrine , ” of the temple . Compare Exodus xxvi . 33 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note6_6" place="bottom" n="6">This sonnet , which appeared in the volume of 1859 , reveals the retiring , meditative temper of the poet . To him quiet reflection was more than action . He loved to dwell in spirit with the good and great of the past . The rude struggles of the market-place for wealth and power were repugnant to his refined and sensitive nature .</note>
   <note xml:id="note7_4" place="bottom" n="7">Something served for the refreshment of a person ; here an intellectual feast fit for a prince .</note>
   <note xml:id="note8_3" place="bottom" n="8">Arcady , or Arcadia , is a place of ideal simplicity and contentment ; so called from a picturesque district in Greece , which was noted for the simplicity and happiness of its people .</note>
   <note xml:id="note9_3" place="bottom" n="9">This poem will serve to illustrate Hayne 's skill in the use of blank verse . It is a piece of rare excellence and beauty . The name of the heroine is pronounced Ee-thra .</note>
   <note xml:id="note10_3" place="bottom" n="10">This migration occurred about 708 B. C .</note>
   <note xml:id="note11_2" place="bottom" n="11">Apollo was one of the major deities of Grecian mythology . He was regarded , among other things , as the god of song or minstrelsy , and also as the god of prophetic inspiration . The most celebrated oracle of Apollo was at Delphi .</note>
   <note xml:id="note12_2" place="bottom" n="12">A town in southern Italy , now Taranto . It was in ancient times a place of great commercial importance .</note>
   <note xml:id="note13_2" place="bottom" n="13">For the occasion of this poem , see page 61 . The poet had a peculiar fondness for the pine , which in one of his poems he calls —</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ My sylvan darling ! set ‘ twixt shade and sheen ,</l>
     <l n="2">Soft as a maid , yet stately as a queen ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is the subject of a half-dozen poems ,— The Voice of the Pines , Aspect of the Pines , In the Pine Barrens , The Dryad of the Pine , The Pine 's Mystery , and The Axe and the Pine ,— all of them in his happiest vein . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note14_2" place="bottom" n="14">In The Pine 's Mystery we read :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Passion and mystery murmur through the leaves ,</l>
     <l n="2">Passion and mystery , touched by deathless pain ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whose monotone of long , low anguish grieves</l>
     <l n="4">For something lost that shall not live again . ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note15_2" place="bottom" n="15">Hayne 's very careful workmanship is rarely at fault ; but here there seems to be an infelicitous epithet that amounts to a sort of tautology . “ Eyes ablaze ” would necessarily “ look forth with burning gaze . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note16" place="bottom" n="16">This poem illustrates the poet 's method of dealing with Nature . He depicts its beauty as discerned by the artistic imagination . He is less concerned with the messages of Nature than with its lovely forms . This poem , in its felicitous word-painting , reminds us of Tennyson , though it would be difficult to find in the English poet so brilliant a succession of masterly descriptions .</note>
   <p>With this poem may be compared Hayne 's Cloud Fantasies , a sonnet that brings before us , with great vividness , the somber appearance of the clouds in autumn . See also A Phantom in the Clouds . No other of our poets has dwelt so frequently and so delightfully on the changing aspects of the sky .</p>
   <p>Compare Shelley 's The Cloud . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note17" place="bottom" n="17">It is not often that Hayne assumed the hortatory tone found in this poem . In artistic temperament he was akin to Keats rather than to Longfellow . Even in his didactic poems , he is meditative and descriptive rather than hortatory . The artist in him hardly ever gave place to the preacher .</note>
   <note xml:id="note18" place="bottom" n="18">The seraph 's name was Uriel , that is , God 's Light . In Revelation ( xix . 17 ) we read , “ And I saw an angel standing in the sun . ” Milton calls him —</note>

     <l n="1">It is a place whither I have often gone</l>
     <l n="2">For peace , and found it , secret , hushed , and cool ,</l>
     <l n="3">A beautiful recess in neighboring woods .</l>
     <l n="4">Trees of the soberest hues , thick-leaved and tall .</l>
     <l n="5">Arch it o'erhead and column it around ,</l>
     <l n="6">Framing a covert , natural and wild ,</l>
     <l n="7">Domelike and dim ; though nowhere so enclosed</l>
     <l n="8">But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot</l>
     <l n="9">Unwearied and unweakened . Sound is here</l>
     <l n="10">A transient and unfrequent visitor ;</l>
     <l n="11">Yet , if the day be calm , not often then ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whilst the high pines in one another 's arms</l>

     <l n="28">But one day ,</l>
     <l n="29">One of those July days when winds have fled</l>

     <l n="31">With thoughts that shall be nameless , yet , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="32">Wrong , or at least unhealthful , since though dark</l>

     <l n="38">Not a leaf</l>
     <l n="39">Stirred with the whispering welcome which I sought ,</l>
     <l n="40">But in a close and humid atmosphere ,</l>
     <l n="41">Every fair plant and implicated bough</l>
     <l n="42">Hung lax and lifeless . Something in the place ,</l>
     <l n="43">Its utter stillness , the unusual heat ,</l>
     <l n="44">And some more secret influence , I thought ,</l>
     <l n="45">Weighed on the sense like sin . Above I saw ,</l>
     <l n="46">Though not a cloud was visible in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="47">The pallid sky look through a glazèd mist</l>
     <l n="48">Like a blue eye in death .</l>
     <l n="49">The change , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="50">Was natural enough ; my jaundiced sight ,</l>
     <l n="51">The weather , and the time explain it all :</l>
     <l n="52">Yet have I drawn a lesson from the spot ,</l>
     <l n="53">And shrined it in these verses for my heart .</l>
     <l n="54">Thenceforth those tranquil precincts I have sought</l>
     <l n="55">Not less , and in all shades of various moods ;</l>
     <l n="56">But always shun to desecrate the spot</l>
     <l n="57">By vain repinings , sickly sentiments ,</l>
     <l n="58">Or inconclusive sorrows . Nature , though</l>
     <l n="59">Pure as she was in Eden when her breath</l>
     <l n="60">Kissed the white brow of Eve , doth not refuse ,</l>
     <l n="61">In her own way and with a just reserve ,</l>
     <l n="62">To sympathize with human suffering ;<span corresp="#note18_2" type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span></l>
     <l n="63">But for the pains , the fever , and the fret</l>

     <l n="65">She hath no solace ; and who seeks her when</l>
     <l n="66">These be the troubles over which he moans ,</l>
     <l n="67">Reads in her unreplying lineaments</l>

   <note xml:id="note1_13" place="bottom" n="1">This poem , which first appeared in Russell 's Magazine , exhibits one of Timrod 's characteristics : he does not describe Nature for its own sake , as Hayne often does , but for the sake of some truth or lesson in relation to man . The lesson of this poem is that a life of uninterrupted ease and comfort is not favorable to the development of noble character .</note>
   <note xml:id="note2_12" place="bottom" n="2">This selection illustrates the fierce energy of the poet 's martial lyrics . Compare Bannockburn by Burns , which Carlyle said “ should be sung with the throat of the whirlwind . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note3_10" place="bottom" n="3">Byre is a cow-stable .</note>
   <note xml:id="note4_9" place="bottom" n="4">Rack , usually wrack , signifies ruin or destruction .</note>
   <note xml:id="note5_7" place="bottom" n="5">This lyric , which was sung on the occasion of decorating the graves of the Confederate dead in Magnolia Cemetery , Charleston , South Carolina , in 1867 , has been much admired , especially the last stanza .</note>
   <note xml:id="note6_7" place="bottom" n="6">It is interesting to know that this prediction has been fulfilled . A monument of granite now stands above the dead .</note>
   <note xml:id="note7_5" place="bottom" n="7">Behalf , instead of in behalf of , is a rather hazardous construction .</note>
   <note xml:id="note8_4" place="bottom" n="8">A noble bronze figure of a color bearer on a granite pedestal now commemorates the fallen heroes .</note>
   <note xml:id="note9_4" place="bottom" n="9">This poem first appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1851 . The first stanza of this half-playful , half-serious piece , mentions the objects in which the poet most delighted .</note>
   <note xml:id="note10_4" place="bottom" n="10">This belief has been frequently held , and has some support from recent scientific experiments . But that this sentiency goes as far as the poet describes , is of course pure fancy .</note>
   <note xml:id="note11_3" place="bottom" n="11">The sibyls ( Sybil is an incorrect form ) were , according to ancient mythology , prophetic women . The sibylline leaves or books contained their teachings , and were preserved with the utmost care in Rome . The sibyl of Cumae conducted Aeneas through the under world , as narrated in the sixth book of Virgil 's Aeneid .</note>
   <note xml:id="note12_3" place="bottom" n="12">This sonnet expresses the poet 's creed , to which his practice was confirmed . This fact imparts unusual simplicity to his verse — a simplicity that strikes us all the more at the present time , when an over-refinement of thought and expression is in vogue .</note>
   <note xml:id="note13_3" place="bottom" n="13">This sonnet , on the commonest of all poetic themes , treats of love in a deep , serious way . It is removed as far as possible from the sentimental .</note>
   <note xml:id="note14_3" place="bottom" n="14">This line reminds us of a well-known passage in Byron :— “ Man 's love is of man 's life a thing apart ; ‘ Tis woman 's whole existence . Man may range The court , camp , church , the vessel and the mart ; Sword , gown , gain , glory , offer in exchange Pride , fame , ambition , to fill up his heart , And few there are whom these cannot estrange . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note15_3" place="bottom" n="15">This is the divine ideal , the realization of which will bring the true “ Golden Age . ” “ God is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him . ” — I John iv . 16 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note16_2" place="bottom" n="16">This poem first appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1852 . It will serve to show Timrod 's manner of using blank verse . It will be observed that “ a lesson ” is again the principal thing .</note>
   <note xml:id="note17_2" place="bottom" n="17">This recalls the closing lines of Longfellow 's Sunrise on the Hills :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ If thou art worn and hard beset</l>
     <l n="2">With sorrows that thou wouldst forget ,</l>
     <l n="3">If thou wouldst read a lesson that will keep</l>
     <l n="4">Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep ,</l>
     <l n="5">Go to the woods and hills ! No tears</l>
     <l n="6">Dim the sweet look that Nature wears . ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note18_2" place="bottom" n="18">Compare the following lines from Bryant 's Thanatopsis :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ To him who in the love of Nature holds</l>
     <l n="2">Communion with her visible forms , she speaks</l>
     <l n="3">A various language ; for his gayer hours</l>
     <l n="4">She has a voice of gladness , and a smile</l>
     <l n="5">And eloquence of beauty , and she glides</l>
     <l n="6">Into his darker musings , with a mild</l>
     <l n="7">And healing sympathy , that steals away</l>
     <l n="8">Their sharpness , ere he is aware . ” ]</l>

   <note xml:id="note1_14" place="bottom" n="1">This poem was first published in Scott 's Magazine , Atlanta , Georgia , from which it is here taken . It at once became popular , and was copied in many newspapers throughout the South . It was subsequently revised , and the changes , which are pointed out below , are interesting as showing the development of the poet 's artistic sense .</note>
   <p>The singularly rapid and musical lilt of this poem may be readily traced to its sources . It is due to the skillful use of short vowels , liquid consonants , internal rhyme , and constant alliteration . These are matters of technique which Lanier studiously employed throughout his poetry .</p>
   <p>This poem abounds in seeming irregularities of meter . The fundamental measure is iambic tetrameter , as in the line —</p>
   <p>“ The rushes cried , Abide , abide ” ;</p>
   <p>but trochees , dactyls , or anapests are introduced in almost every line , yet without interfering with the time element of the verse . These irregularities were no doubt introduced in order to increase the musical effects . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note2_13" place="bottom" n="2">As may be seen by reference to a map , the Chattahoochee rises in Habersham County , in northeastern Georgia , and in its south - westerly course passes through the adjoining county of Hall . Its entire length is about five hundred miles .</note>

   <note xml:id="note4_10" place="bottom" n="4">This line was changed to —</note>
   <p>“ The laving laurel turned my tide . ” ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note5_8" place="bottom" n="5">In this line the use of a needless antiquated form may be fairly questioned . In the revised form “ win ” is changed to “ work . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note6_8" place="bottom" n="6">“ Barred ” is changed to “ did bar ” in the revision — a doubtful gain .</note>
   <note xml:id="note7_6" place="bottom" n="7">The preceding four lines show a decided poetic gain in the revised form :—</note>
   <lg>

     <l n="3">Ruby , garnet , and amethyst —</l>
     <l n="4">Made lures with the lightnings of streaming stone . ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note8_5" place="bottom" n="8">The revised form , with an awkward pause after the first foot , and also a useless antiquated phrase , reads —</note>
   <p>“ Avail ! I am fain for to water the plain . ” ]</p>

   <note xml:id="note10_5" place="bottom" n="10">“ Final ” was changed to “ lordly ” with fine effect . This poem challenges comparison with other pieces of similar theme . It lacks the exquisite workmanship of Tennyson 's The Brook , with its incomparable onomatopoeic effects :—</note>

   </lg>
   <p>But The Song of the Chattahoochee has what the other poems lack , — a lofty moral purpose . The noble stream consciously resists the allurements of pleasure to heed “ the voices of duty , ” and this spirit imparts to it a greater dignity and weight . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note11_4" place="bottom" n="11">This poem appeared in The Independent , July 15 , 1880 , from which it is taken . It illustrates the intellectual rather than the musical side of Lanier 's genius . It is purely didactic , and thought rather than melody guides the poet 's pen . The meter is quite regular ,— an unusual thing in our author 's most characteristic work .</note>
   <p>It shows Lanier 's use of pentameter blank verse ,— a use that is somewhat lacking in ease and clearness . The first sentence is longer than that of Paradise Lost , without Milton 's unity and force . Such ponderous sentences are all too frequent in Lanier , and as a result he is sometimes obscure . Repeated readings are necessary to take in the full meaning of his best work .</p>
   <p>This poem , though not bearing the distinctive marks of his genius , is peculiarly interesting for two reasons ,— it gives us an insight into his wide range of reading and study , and it exhibits his penetration and sanity as a critic . In the long list of great names he never fails to put his finger on the vulnerable spot . Frequently he is exceedingly felicitous , as when he speaks of “ rapt Behmen , rapt too far , ” or of “ Emerson , Most wise , that yet , in finding Wisdom , lost Thy Self sometimes . ” ]</p>

   <note xml:id="note32" place="bottom" n="32">Lanier was deeply religious , but his beliefs were broader than any creed . In Remonstrance he exclaims ,—</note>

   </lg>
   <p>Yet , as shown in the conclusion of The Crystal he had an exalted sense of the unapproachable beauty of the life and teachings of Christ . His tenderest poem is A Ballad of Trees and the Master :—</p>

     <l n="1">“ Into the woods my Master went ,</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note33" place="bottom" n="33">This poem was first published in The Independent , December 14 , 1882 , from which it is here taken . The editor said , “ This poem , we do not hesitate to say , is one of the few great poems that have been written on this side of the ocean . ” With this judgment there will be general agreement on the part of appreciative readers . On the emotional side , it may be said to reach the high-water mark of poetic achievement in this country . Its emotion at times reaches the summits of poetic rapture ; a little more , and it would have passed into the boundary of hysterical ecstasy .</note>
   <p>The circumstances of its composition possess a melancholy interest . It was Lanier 's last and greatest poem . He penciled it a few months before his death when he was too feeble to raise his food to his mouth and when a burning fever was consuming him . Had he not made this supreme effort , American literature would be the poorer . This poem exhibits , in a high degree , the poet 's love for Nature . Indeed , most of his great pieces — The Marshes of Glynn , Clover , Corn , and others — are inspired by the sights and sounds of Nature . Sunrise , in general tone and style , closely resembles The Marshes of Glynn .</p>
   <p>The musical theories of Lanier in relation to poetry find their highest exemplification in Sunrise . It is made up of all the poetic feet — iambics , trochees , dactyls , anapests — so that it almost defies any attempt at scansion . But the melody of the verse never fails ; equality of time is observed , along with a rich use of alliteration and assonance .</p>
   <p>The poem may be easily analyzed ; and a distinct notation of its successive themes may be helpful to the young reader . Its divisions are marked by its irregular stanzas . It consists of fifteen parts as follows : 1 . The call of the marshes to the poet in his slumbers , and his awaking . 2 . He comes as a lover to the live-oaks and marshes . 3 . His address to the “ man-bodied tree , ” and the “ cunning green leaves . ” 4 . His petition for wisdom and for a prayer of intercession . 5 . The stirring of the owl . 6 . Address to the “ reverend marsh , distilling silence . ” 7 . Description of the full tide . 8 . “ The bow-and-string tension of beauty and silence . ” 9 . The motion of dawn . 10 . The golden flush of the eastern sky . 11 . The sacramental marsh at worship . 12 . The slow rising of the sun above the sea horizon . 13 . Apostrophe to heat . 14 . The worker must pass from the contemplation of this splendor to his toil . 15 . The poet 's inextinguishable adoration of the sun . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note34" place="bottom" n="34">“ Gospeling glooms ” means glooms that convey to the sensitive spirit sweet messages of good news .</note>
   <note xml:id="note35" place="bottom" n="35">Lanier continually attributes personality to the objects of Nature , and places them in tender relations to man . Here the little leaves become —</note>
   <p>“ Friendly , sisterly , sweetheart leaves , ”</p>
   <p>as a few lines before they were “ little masters . ” In Individuality we read ,—</p>
   <p>“ Sail on , sail on , fair cousin Cloud . ”</p>
   <p>And in Corn there is a passage of great tenderness :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The leaves that wave against my cheek caress</l>
     <l n="2">Like women 's hands ; the embracing boughs express</l>
     <l n="3">A subtlety of mighty tenderness ;</l>
     <l n="4">The copse-depths into little noises start ,</l>
     <l n="5">That sound anon like beatings of a heart ,</l>
     <l n="6">Anon like talk ‘ twixt lips not far apart . ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note36" place="bottom" n="36">This passage is Wordsworthian in spirit . Nature is regarded as a teacher who suggests or reveals ineffable things . Lanier might have said , as did Wordsworth ,—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ To me the meanest flower that blows can give</l>
     <l n="2">Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears . ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note37" place="bottom" n="37">Lanier had a lively and vigorous imagination , which is seen in his use of personification and metaphor . In this poem almost every object — trees , leaves , marsh , streams , sun , heat — is personified . This same fondness for personification may be observed in his other characteristic poems .</note>
   <p>In the use of metaphor it may be doubted whether the poet is always so happy . There is sometimes inaptness or remoteness in his resemblances . To liken the naming heavens to a beehive , and the rising sun to a bee issuing from the “ hive-hole , ” can hardly be said to add dignity to the description .</p>
   <p>In Clover men are clover heads , which the Course-of-things , as an ox , browses upon :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ This cool , unasking Ox</l>
     <l n="2">Comes browsing o'er my hills and vales of Time ,</l>
     <l n="3">And thrusts me out his tongue , and curls it , sharp ,</l>
     <l n="4">And sicklewise , about my poets ’ heads ,</l>
     <l n="5">And twists them in ....</l>
     <l n="6">and champs and chews ,</l>
     <l n="7">With slantly-churning jaws and swallows down . ” ]</l>

   <note xml:id="note1_15" place="bottom" n="1">As stated in the sketch of Father Ryan , this poem strikes the keynote to his verse . It therefore properly opens his volume of poems . It became popular on its first publication , and was copied in various papers . It is here taken from the Religious Herald , Richmond , Virginia .</note>
   <note xml:id="note2_14" place="bottom" n="2">The location of The Valley of Silence is given in the last stanza .</note>
   <note xml:id="note3_12" place="bottom" n="3">This poem may be taken , in a measure , as autobiographic . In this stanza , and the two following ones , the poet refers to that period of his life before he resolved to consecrate himself to the priesthood .</note>
   <note xml:id="note4_11" place="bottom" n="4">This indicates the general character of his poetry . Inspired in The Valley of Silence , it is sad , meditative , mystical , religious .</note>
   <note xml:id="note5_9" place="bottom" n="5">Perhaps every poet has this experience . There come to him elusive glimpses of truth and beauty which are beyond the grasp of speech . As some one has sung :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Sometimes there rise , from deeps unknown ,</l>
     <l n="2">Before my inmost gaze ,</l>
     <l n="3">Far brighter scenes than earth has shown</l>
     <l n="4">In morning 's orient blaze ;</l>
     <l n="5">I try to paint the visions bright ,</l>
     <l n="6">But , oh , their glories turn to night ! ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note6_9" place="bottom" n="6">This poem was first published in Father Ryan 's paper , the Banner of the South , March 21 , 1868 , from which it is here taken . Coming so soon after the close of the Civil War , it touched the Southern heart .</note>
   <note xml:id="note7_7" place="bottom" n="7">For a criticism of the versification of this stanza , see the chapter on Father Ryan .</note>
   <note xml:id="note8_6" place="bottom" n="8">This note of pardon , in keeping with the poet 's priestly character , is found in several of his lyrics referring to the war . In spite of his strong Southern feeling , there is no unrelenting bitterness . Thus , in The Prayer of the South , which appeared a week later , we read :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Father , I kneel ‘ mid ruin , wreck , and grave ,—</l>
     <l n="2">A desert waste , where all was erst so fair ,—</l>
     <l n="3">And for my children and my foes I crave</l>
     <l n="4">Pity and pardon . Father , hear my prayer ! ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note9_6" place="bottom" n="9">This was the poet 's feeling in 1868 . In a similar strain we read in The Prayer of the South :—</note>
   <p>“ My heart is filled with anguish deep and vast ! My hopes are buried with my children 's dust ! My joys have fled , my tears are flowing fast ! In whom , save Thee , our Father , shall I trust ? ”</p>
   <p>Happily the poet lived to see a new order of things — an era in which vain regrets gave place to energetic courage , hope , and endeavor . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note10_6" place="bottom" n="10">This poem first appeared in the Banner of the South , April 4 , 1868 , and , like the preceding one , has been very popular in the South .</note>
   <note xml:id="note11_5" place="bottom" n="11">Father Ryan felt great admiration for General Lee , who has remained in the South the popular hero of the war . In the last of his Sentinel Songs , the poet-priest pays a beautiful tribute to the stainless character of the Confederate leader :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Go , Glory , and forever guard</l>
     <l n="2">Our chieftain 's hallowed dust ;</l>
     <l n="3">And Honor , keep eternal ward ,</l>
     <l n="4">And Fame , be this thy trust !</l>
     <l n="5">Go , with your bright emblazoned scroll</l>
     <l n="6">And tell the years to be ,</l>
     <l n="7">The first of names to flash your roll</l>
     <l n="8">Is ours — great Robert Lee . ” ]</l>

   <note xml:id="note12_5" place="bottom" n="12">This poem was first published in the Banner of the South , April 25 , 1868 . It illustrates the profounder themes on which the poet loved to dwell , and likewise the Christian faith by which they were illumined .</note>
   <note xml:id="note13_5" place="bottom" n="13">This mournful view of life appears frequently in Father Ryan 's poems . In De Profundis , for example , we read :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ All the hours are full of tears —</l>
     <l n="2">O my God ! woe are we !</l>
     <l n="3">Grief keeps watch in brightest eyes —</l>
     <l n="4">Every heart is strung with fears ,</l>
     <l n="5">Woe are we ! woe are we !</l>
     <l n="6">All the light hath left the skies ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the living , awe-struck crowds</l>
     <l n="8">See above them only clouds ,</l>
     <l n="9">And around them only shrouds . ” ]</l>

   <note xml:id="note14_5" place="bottom" n="14">This poem , as the two preceding ones , is taken from the Banner of the South , where it appeared June 13 , 1868 . It affords a glimpse of the tragical romance of the poet 's life . The voice that he hears is that of “ Ethel , ” the lost love of his youth . Her memory never left him . In the poem entitled What ? it is again her spirit voice that conveys to his soul an ineffable word .</note>
   <note xml:id="note15_5" place="bottom" n="15">This desire for death occurs in several poems , as When ? and Rest . In the latter poem it is said :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ Twas always so ; when but a child I laid</l>
     <l n="2">On mother 's breast</l>
     <l n="3">My wearied little head — e'en then I prayed</l>
     <l n="4">As now — for rest . ” ]</l>
