    <p>OTHER BOOKS by Ella Wheeler Wilcox THREE WOMEN POEMS OF POWER MAURINE POEMS OF PASSION POEMS OF PLEASURE KINGDOM OF LOVE AND OTHER POEMS AN ERRING WOMAN 'S LOVE EVERY-DAY THOUGHTS MEN WOMEN AND EMOTIONS AN AMBITIOUS MAN THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF NOD AROUND THE YEAR WITH ELLA WHEELER WILCOX A Birthday Book Oh , you who read some song that I have sung , What know you of the soul from whence it sprung ? Dost dream the poet ever speaks aloud His secret thought unto the listening crowd ? Go take the murmuring sea-shell from the shore : You have its shape , its color and no more . It tells not one of those vast mysteries That lie beneath the surface of the seas . Our songs are shells , cast out by-waves of thought ; Here , take them at your pleasure ; but think not You 've seen beneath the surface of the waves , Where lie our shipwrecks and our coral caves .</p>

    <p>THE POET 'S SONG</p>
   </figure>
   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Among the twelve hundred poems which have emanated from my too prolific pen there are some forty or fifty which treat entirely of that emotion which has been denominated “ the grand passion ” — love . A few of those are of an extremely fiery character .</p>
    <p n="2">When I issued my collection known as “ Maurine , and Other Poems , ” I purposely omitted all save two or three of these . I had been frequently accused of writing only sentimental verses ; and I took pleasure and pride in presenting to the public a volume which contained more than one hundred poems upon other than sentimental topics . But no sooner was the book published than letters of regret came to me from friends and strangers , and from all quarters of the globe , asking why this or that love poem had been omitted . These regrets were repeated to me by so many people that I decided to collect and issue these poems in a small volume to be called “ Poems of Passion . ” By the word “ Passion ” I meant the “ grand passion ” of love . To those who take exception to the title of the book I would suggest an early reference to Webster 's definitions of the word .</p>
    <p n="3">Since this volume has caused so much agitation throughout the entire country , and even sent a tremor across the Atlantic into the Old World , I beg leave to make a few statements concerning some of the poems .</p>
    <p n="4">The excitement of mingled horror and amaze seems to center upon four poems , namely : “ Delilah , ” “ Ad Finem , ” “ Conversion , ” and “ Communism . ”</p>
    <p n="5">“ Delilah ” was written and first published in 1877 . I had been reading history , and became stirred by the power of such women as Aspasia and Cleopatra over such grand men as Antony , Socrates , and Pericles . Under the influence of this feeling I dashed off “ Delilah , ” which I meant to be an expression of the powerful fascination of such a woman upon the memory of a man , even as he neared the hour of death . If the poem is immoral , then the history which inspired it is immoral . I consider it my finest effort .</p>
    <p n="6">“ Ad Finem ” was written in 1878 . I think there are few women of strong character and affections who cannot , from either experience or observation , understand the violent intensity of regret and despair which sometimes takes possession of the human heart after the loss by death , fate , or the force of circumstances , of some one very dear .</p>
    <p n="7">In “ Ad Finem ” I intended to give voice to this very common experience of almost every heart . Many noble women have since told me that the poem was true to life . It is not , as many people have wilfully or stupidly construed it , a bit of poetical advice to womankind to “ barter the joys of Paradise ” for “ just one kiss . ” It is simply an illustration of a moment of turbulent anguish and vehement despair , such moments of unreasoning and overwhelming sorrow as the most moral people may experience during a lifetime .</p>
    <p n="8">In “ Communism ” I endeavored to use a new simile in illustrating that somewhat hackneyed theme of the supremacy of Love over Reason ; and simply to carry out my idea I represented the violent uprising of the Communist emotions against King Reason .</p>
    <p n="9">“ Conversion ” was suggested to me by the remark of a gentleman friend . In speaking to me of the woman he loved , he said : “ I have always been a skeptic regarding the existence of heaven , but I am so much happier in my love for this woman than I ever supposed it possible for me to be on earth that I begin to believe that the tales of heavenly raptures may be true . ”</p>
    <p n="10">I embodied his idea in the poem which has brought , with a few others , so much censure and criticism upon this volume , although it contains nearly seventy-five other selections quite irreproachable in character , however faulty they may be in construction .</p>
    <p n="11">It is impossible to pursue a successful literary career and follow the advice of all one 's “ best friends . ” I have received severe censure from my orthodox friends for writing liberal verses . My liberal friends condemn my devout and religious poems as “ aiding superstition . ” My early temperance verses were pronounced “ fanatical trash ” by others .</p>
    <p n="12">With all due thanks and appreciation for the kind motives which interest so many dear friends in my career , I yet feel compelled to follow the light which my own intellect and judgment cast upon my way , rather than any one of the many conflicting rays which other minds would lend me .</p>

       <l n="17">The eye that glistens with an unshed tear —</l>

      <head>THE LOST GARDEN .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There was a fair green garden sloping</l>
       <l n="2">From the south-east side of the mountain-ledge ;</l>
       <l n="3">And the earliest tint of the dawn came groping</l>
       <l n="4">Down through its paths , from the day 's dim edge .</l>
       <l n="5">The bluest skies and the reddest roses</l>
       <l n="6">Arched and varied its velvet sod ;</l>
       <l n="7">And the glad birds sang , as the soul supposes</l>

       <l n="12">For something over the mountain-height .</l>
       <l n="13">I wanted to stand in the blaze of glory</l>
       <l n="14">That turned to crimson the peaks of snow ,</l>
       <l n="15">And the winds from the west all breathed a story</l>

       <l n="17">I saw on the garden 's south side growing</l>

       <l n="19">I saw in the east how the sun was glowing ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the gold air shook with a wild bird 's tune ;</l>
       <l n="21">I heard the drip of a silver fountain ,</l>
       <l n="22">And the pulse of a young laugh throbbed with glee</l>
